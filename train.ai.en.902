I know that things don't always happen the way we want them to.
sure, but in my book, it says that you can see the future.
why can't you just look and see what's gonna happen?
well, that ability is complicated.
I didn't always have it.
and then when I did...
well...
it's maybe not the gift one would expect.
seeing the inevitable...
can be a terrible price.
but you wouldn't have to worry about stuff.
you'd just know.
but that's the great trap.
the future... is like a puzzle...
with missing pieces... Difficult to read.
and never, never what you think.
did you find him?
sorry. Your son... got away.
who are you?
so it is true.
you really don't remember anything.
are we friends?
we spent some time together.
but I'm here because I believe you can help me find something that belongs to Rumplestiltskin.
Wh... who? - Mr. Gold.
I, uh, I don't know him.
not anymore.
but you did.
shouldn't we be pillaging his shop or ransacking his home?
that would be the obvious choice, yes, but Gold wouldn't risk crossing the town line and losing his memory without entrusting the dagger's location to someone.
my guess is she hid it in one of her beloved books.
impressive, Regina.
thank you, mother.
I'll be impressed when I'm holding the dagger in my hand.
no. It should be here.
well, it's not, is it? May we go now?
hold on.
what's this?
Oh, yes. Crude.
to the untrained eye, a child's scribbles, but to a pirate...it's a map.
gold may not have hidden the dagger here, but I believe he's left us the next best thing.
its location. - Can you read it?
well, lucky for you ladies, I'm quite adept at finding buried treasure.
so Rumplestiltskin is Henry's grandfather?
apparently.
but I'm his grandfather.
you can have more than one.
so his... step-grandmother is Regina, the Evil Queen.
actually, his step-great-grandmother.
and she's also his adoptive mother.
it's a good thing we don't have Thanksgiving in our land, 'cause that dinner would suck.
or... maybe this will mellow everyone out.
gold, wait. What are you doing?
I'm finding my son.
he's gone.
but he lives here. He'll be back, and I'll be waiting.
stop. You can't just break in.
Yeah, well, actually, that's something I'm quite adept at.
he might not come back.
okay. Finding people is what you do, Ms. Swan.
I'm simply going to assist you.
there may be information in here...
who he is, what he does, who he loves.
no, don't do this. There are things called laws.
I'll be lookout. - No, I...
you could get arrested.
then my son will have to testify against me, and we will be reunited.
this way.
keep it moving this way.
lucky bastards.
I think they'd beg to differ.
they're not dead, but they can't fight, which means they get sent home.
that's the only way outta here alive.
when the ogres rip you limb from limb, pray that they're quick.
fortune favors us!
fresh supplies have arrived from the Duke.
today, we will not be marching into battle.
we'll be riding.
riding? Riding what?
what kind of question is that? A horse, of course.
now grab yourself a cow and get ready.
I'm sorry, sir. Wh... what did you say?
a cow.
the saddles we just got in... made from the finest leather.
we call 'em "cows.
grab yours, so at least the ride into doom will be a soft one on your backside.
are you all right? - Yeah. Yes.
you... you go. I'll catch up.
Oh, no.
so it's all true.
I'm going to have a son. And I'm gonna die?
answer me!
gold. Come on, please. We really shouldn't be here.
I don't think he's listening.
you find something, dearie? - Nothing.
uh, it just looks like a dream catcher.
Yeah, well, if it's nothing, why are you still holding it?
you're lying to me. - Just get back to looking, okay?
no, no, no. You saw something. Tell me.
you don't know what you're talk... - Tell me!
Henry, go wait in the bathroom. - But I can help...
Henry, go!
there's nothing here. The guy's a ghost.
what, you think me a fool?
you're holding back. I wanna know what and why.
I'm not holding back... - Did he tell you something?
gold... - Did he tell you something?!
nothing. He didn't say anything.
but you talked to... - Don't put words in my mouth...
tell me!
you tell me, or I'm gonna make you tell me.
you don't have magic here. - Oh, I don't need magic.
you really wanna do this?
do not push me. - Don't push me.
we had a deal! A deal!
no one... no one breaks deals with me!
leave her alone.
Wh... what's his name?
a strong name!
something he'll need if he's to live with the shame of being your son.
Wh... what are you talking about?
Rumple, is it true? - Is what true?
did you injure yourself...
so that you wouldn't have to fight? So that you would be sent home?
who told you that? - Everyone.
rumors travel quickly from the front.
Rumple, did you do this to yourself?
did you do it to yourself?! - Yes!
a seer told me I was gonna die in the battle.
you did this because a seer told you to do it?
she was right about everything else.
I left the front to be with you...
you and... Baelfire.
you left because you were afraid.
you became what everyone thought you were... a coward.
stop. - Just like your father!
I am nothing like my father.
he tried to abandon me.
I will never, ever do that to my son.
that's why I did this...
for him. All for the boy.
to save him from the same fate I suffered growing up without a father.
you sentence him to a fate much worse...
growing up as your son.
what? Wh... what else could I do?
you could have fought, Rumple.
you could have died.
you don't mean that. You don't mean that.
Oh, it's all right, Bae.
it's all right.
your papa's here.
and I promise...
I will never...
ever leave you.
you came back for me.
no. I came to make sure you didn't hurt her.
I've seen what you do to people who break deals.
please, Bae, just let me talk.
I have no interest in talking to you. You can go.
I'm not going anywhere. - Get out of my apartment!
Neal... - Emma, I got this.
you two know each other.
you two know each other. How?
you sent me chasing after him. - No, no, no. Stop it!
you're lying. How do you two know each other?!
mom? Wh... what's going on?
who's this? - My son.
what?
is that Baelfire?
I need you to stay in the other room for a little while longer, okay? Come on.
wait. H... how old are you? - Don't answer him.
how old are you, kid?! - 11!
now why is everyone yelling?
he's 11?
mom?
is this my son? - No. My dad was a fireman.
he... he died.
that's what you t... told me.
you said...
is this... my son?
Yes.
Baelfire... Please. Please. All I want is a chance to be heard.
get out.
look, you came back to protect Emma, to show that she had lived up to her end of her bargain with me.
and now she has. You can go.
no. Our deal was for her to get you to talk to me.
if you truly want her deal to be fulfilled...
you have but one choice.
you have to talk to me.
you got three minutes.
n... no, I... I'm okay. Yeah.
no, they... they said I'm... I'm good to go.
but, um, you know, I think I'm gonna stay here for little while.
Why?
well, take a look at this and see.
I give you the location of the dagger.
well done, Hook.
we'll take it from here.
no. You promised me!
the kris dagger's much too powerful to be wasted on you.
so... is... this what it was all about?
getting Rumple's dagger so you could obtain his dark powers?
if we possess the dagger, we control The Dark One.
and when he returns to Storybrooke, we can command him to kill Snow White, Prince Charming, and Emma.
our enemies will be vanquished, and you will be blameless in the eyes of the only person who matters.
so that's him.
Yeah.
why didn't you tell me?
because I never thought I would see him again.
I never wanted to.
why not?
he was a thief, Henry.
a liar, a bad guy, and he...he broke my heart.
I could have taken it, you know. The truth.
I know.
he was just a part of my life I... wanted to forget.
that's why I didn't tell you.
I was thinking of me, not you.
I thought you were different, but you're just like her... Regina.
she always lied to me, too.
I'm sorry.
I wanna meet my dad.
clock's ticking.
I know I've made mistakes.
but you must believe me.
I wanna make up for it.
there's no greater pain than regret.
try abandonment.
please.
let me make it up to you.
how are you gonna do that?
I grew up alone.
I grew up without a father. You can make up for that?
Yeah. Yes, I can.
two minutes.
come with me to Storybrooke. There's magic there.
I can turn the clock back.
make you 14 again.
we can start over.
14? I don't wanna be 14... again.
are you... are you insane?
I can't make up for the lost time, but I can take away the memories. Bae.
take away who I am... no, thanks.
one minute.
BAE... please.
give me a chance.
you once loved me. - You were once a good man.
I can be that man again.
I've changed.
look... I came here...
to this city without magic.
Yeah, yeah, and you're still trying to use it to make up for your mistakes.
still think that can make it all better.
it won't. You can't.
you have no idea what I've lived with.
you're so worried about you. You know what I've dealt with?
every night for more years than you could know...
the last thing I see before sleep is the image of you...
you and me over that pit, your hand...
wrapped around mine.
and then you open your grip.
and as I fall away, all I can see is your face.
choosing all... this...
crap over me.
letting me go...
now it's my turn.
now I'm letting you go.
I'm sorry. - I don't care.
I didn't get closure, so you don't, either.
gotta go.
Oh, Bae. - No. Time's up.
I've been expecting you.
then you know exactly why I came here.
what I foretold during the Ogres War has finally come to pass.
well, in a manner of speaking.
I, uh, hobbled myself on the battlefield, was branded a coward.
my wife ran away and left me.
then my son was called to the front.
then I became The Dark One...
then Bae left me.
so, yes, my actions on the battlefield left my son fatherless.
but... It would've been nice to know about all that pesky detail.
knowing would not have made a difference.
you still would have been powerless to escape your fate.
just... like... you.
now you know exactly why I came here.
you want to find your son. - Indeed.
you will... find him.
how?
and this time, don't leave out a single detail.
it will not be an easy path.
it will take many years...
and require a curse.
a curse...
powerful enough to rip everyone from this land.
Yes, yes, there's more. I know it. Tell me.
you will not cast the curse.
someone else will.
and you will not break the curse.
someone else... will.
tell me!
I don't know.
even my powers have limits.
not good enough, dearie.
if you want to see the path you must take, there is only one way.
take this burden from me.
gladly.
he wants to meet you.
you weren't gonna tell me about him.
no, I wasn't.
Yeah, well, he's my kid, too, so you don't get to make that decision by yourself anymore.
great. Go talk to him, then.
but... don't break his heart.
trust me, I'm not gonna do to him what he did to me.
and what you did to me.
okay. I get it.
we're all messed up.
what do you say we try to avoid that with him? All right?
all right.
so... you're my dad.
Yeah.
I'm Henry.
it's nice to meet you, Henry.
sorry I took so long. - It's okay.
you didn't know.
I can't... see... anything.
it's too much. It's nothing but a jumble.
the future is a puzzle with many pieces to be sorted.
in time, you will learn to separate what can be from what will be.
this is why you wanted to give me your power...
to free yourself from this torment.
in time, you will work it all out.
wait.
as gratitude, I offer you one piece of the puzzle.
you will be reunited with your son, and it will come in a most unexpected way.
how?
a boy...
a young boy will lead you to him.
but beware, Rumplestiltskin, for that boy is more than he appears.
he will lead you to what you seek.
but there will be a price.
the boy... will be your undoing.
then I'll just have to kill him.
I'm Tamara. - Emma.
she's my fiancee.
not my son!
dad! - Don't stop! Run!
I'm not leaving without my father.
I'm afraid you are, because he's not here.
listen, I have to warn you.
sorry I'm late. It's been a heck of a day.
before you turn into a little boy, you were trying to warn us about something.
I don't remember.
I will go with you forever.
deal!
belle! - Who's Belle?
you will be reunited with your son.
how?
a young boy will lead you to him.
the boy will be your undoing.
then I'll just have to kill him.
and now, my boy, for your present.
pick one object from the shop. Anything you like.
that.
Oh, hey, careful, buddy. Wands are powerful.
so how does it work?
here. Let me show you.
why would you do that?! - The prophecy.
the seer said the boy would be my undoing.
so I have no choice. I must be his.
seems like we've both been pushed to the sidelines.
what are you doing here?
the real question is, what's your son doing with mine?
Oh, that.
that's right. You didn't get the birth announcement, did you?
that's Henry's father.
what?
do I have to spell it out for you?
ms. Swan and my son... - You're Henry's grandfather?
guess that makes us family.
he's got my eyes, don't you think?
you did this.
trust me, dearie, it was as much a shock to me as it is to you.
no. You must have known.
when I adopted him, it was you who procured him for me.
you expect me to believe that that was a coincidence?
no, not coincidence.
fate. And apparently, fate has a sense of humor.
fate.
so you're playing the part of the loving grandpa now?
they won't accept you, no matter what you do.
not your son, not any of them.
Yeah, we'll see. - I've already seen, Gold.
I've seen your dark heart, and it always wins out.
you always choose darkness.
you know, you think you know me, dearie.
but you don't.
I know you well enough.
if your own son couldn't bring out the good in you, who will?
you're... you're alive.
indeed I am.
I imagine my last phone call was a bit alarming.
Yeah.
sounded like you were on your deathbed.
I'm really sorry if I startled you.
I know that you have no memory of me.
but my feelings for you are real.
and I just needed you to know that in case...
well, in case I died.
I'm glad you're okay.
and I could tell your feelings were true.
you could?
I have a sense about people.
I can't explain how, but I... I could just tell.
so you believe we know each other?
I believe that whatever caused me to forget myself, means that I have a past, and...
that past probably included you.
it did.
when I, uh... when I was injured, I...
this is gonna sound crazy.
I remember you healing me.
you've been through a lot.
serious injury.
all the drugs you've been on since you've been in here.
once you remember who you are, it'll all become clear.
can you help me do that?
remember who I am?
only if you help me remember who I am.
sorry, what?
belle, you always brought out the best in me, and right now I need that.
so, yes, I will do everything I can to bring you back, for you and for me.
we can help each other.
Yeah.
let's talk to someone about getting you out of here.
you've been locked up long enough.
when you so eagerly agreed to come and work for me,
I assumed you wouldn't miss your family quite so much.
I made my sacrifice for them. Of... of course I miss them, you beast!
Yes, yes, of course. But the crying must stop.
night after night. It's making it very difficult for me to spin.
you know, I do my best thinking then.
here.
perhaps this'll help? - For me?
not quite so beastly now, am I?
thank you.
maybe now I can actually get some sleep.
no, no, no. It's not to help you sleep, dearie.
it's to muffle the cries so I can get back to work!
are you sure you wanna do this, dearie?
pretty sure.
if you don't know how to use that wand, it can do nasty things to you.
well, then, uh... I'll stick to what I know works.
do you know what this arrow can do to you?
has to hit me first.
shouldn't be a problem.
an arrow fired from this bow always finds its target.
don't you just love magic?
I know I do.
as do I.
but don't you know? All magic comes with a price.
and in your case, that's me.
hello.
I don't think we've been properly introduced.
I'm Regina. I'm the mayor of this town.
just wanted to make sure you're okay.
that's, uh, that's very thorough of you.
thank you, but I... I'm fine.
I think I am. Mr. Gold's, uh, getting me discharged.
he believes he can help me remember who I am.
does he now?
what's this, dear?
did you drop it?
don't think so.
keep looking, dear.
wait.
I... I know... I know what this is.
I think I remember who I am.
well, I'm sure Mr. Gold will be thrilled.
these are the places you saw it?
Yeah. This town's lousy with magic.
now you should go.
if Neal suspects anything, it's gonna make everything we have to do that much harder.
don't worry. He won't.
Greg, have you had any luck finding him?
my dad? No.
but he's here. I'm sure of it.
we will find him. - I know.
but one thing at a time.
now you were able to get the package here, right?
it's right outside town. Couldn't just drive in with it.
and it's... it's stable?
very.
I'll bring the package in tonight. Be ready.
why are we in the middle of nowhere?
why aren't you guys telling me what's going on?
W... why the secrecy?
because you need to see it.
great. That always goes well for me.
listen, whatever it is, it can wait.
august was trying to warn me about something... someone dangerous.
doesn't matter.
why not? - Because of this.
are you here to help? It's not quite harvest time yet.
beans. You're growing magic beans.
that's what you were up to when I was in New York? Why didn't you tell me?
we are telling you.
we kept it a secret to protect the crop.
mother Superior... she cloaked the area.
that way, Anton can do what he does best.
actually, you haven't seen me play darts. But, uh, yeah, I do this pretty good.
um, Anton, don't take this the wrong way, - but w...w... why... why are you so... - Small?
Cora.
she and Regina brought some magic to make me human-sized. Kind of like it.
enough lollygagging! Back to it.
dwarves really like to work.
it's great to see you, Emma. - You, too.
you want to use the beans to make a portal to go back to the Enchanted Forest.
that's the real reason you didn't tell me.
what about ogres and destruction and danger?
we can fix all that. We did it before. We can do it again.
we can start over, Emma.
so you've changed your mind. You wanna go now, too.
not my mind. My heart.
after what I did to Cora, I think restoring our land is the best way to mend it.
it'll be good for all of us, the whole family.
Henry... and you.
we're from there. You're from there.
no. This world is... my home.
and it's been nothing but cruel to you.
if we go back, I think you might be able to have your happy ending.
nurse! Nurse!
there was a patient here suffering from amnesia. Where is she?
Belle? She should still be here.
so where is she?!
uh, yes, Mr. Gold?
someone I care for has gone missing.
only thing she left behind was a matchbook to this vile joint.
vile? Really?
Yeah, okay. We... we could clean it up some.
I don't understand this.
if you knew her, this is the last place she would go for.
really not a fan of the rabbit hole, are ya?
describe her.
brown hair. Beautiful blue eyes.
an accent you wouldn't soon forget.
her name's Belle. - Belle? Are... are you sure?
cause that sounds an awful lot like Lacey.
who the hell is Lacey?
belle. - Uh, name's Lacey.
her name should be "Fast Eddie," 'cause she's a hustler. She's hustling me.
do you remember me?
guy who visited me in hospital. Sure I do.
but now I remember who I am, and that's Lacey.
now if you'll excuse me, you're kinda in my shot.
No! No! No!
I'm gonna need another apron.
uh, they're, uh, they're on the line drying. It'll be some time.
eh, fine, fine.
get to cleaning this one as well.
I'll be back later.
all this because he tried to steal a magic wand?
no, because he tried to steal from me, The Dark One.
you try that, you get skinned alive. Everyone knows that.
actually, no, they don't.
well, they will after they discover the body.
what, did he send you to finish the job?
uh, no. No, not... not at all. Here.
drink this.
I couldn't let this continue. It's... it's inhuman.
I... I couldn't agree more.
but I fear now he'll turn his wrath on you.
if he does, I'll stand up to the beast that he is, because no one...
no one deserves to be tortured.
well, he may beg to differ. - Well, I don't care. He doesn't frighten me.
hurry up. He'll be back soon. Hurry.
but he will... he will kill you...
unless... unless you run away with me.
I can't run.
I made a deal to serve him in exchange for him protecting my...my kingdom and my family from the ogres.
if I... if I were to leave, I may survive, but my family surely won't.
all I can do is wish you luck. - Thank you.
now go. Go.
what have you done with Belle?
I'm sorry. Do I look like a one-handed pirate with a pistol?
you know who shot her.
stop playing games. She's gone and now she's someone else.
you mean she has her memories back. You're welcome.
not her memories. Her curse memories.
Yeah, from the curse you gave me.
you see, all I did was jog things back in place.
well, undo it. Bring her back. - You know I can't.
she crossed the town line. Her old self is gone.
these curse memories she has are now real.
Lacey's here to stay.
any curse can be broken, dearie. Now you are gonna help me...
or what? You'll kill me?
no, you won't. - Oh, won't I?
you're on your best behavior because of your son.
you don't want him to know who you really are, now do you?
so I suggest you get used to Lacey.
all right. I'll find a way.
finding a way isn't the problem, dear. We both know what is.
Yeah, true love's kiss.
and I don't think our new resident feels the same way about you as you do her.
then I'll make her.
there's the charm that should easily woo a lovely young lady.
she'll most certainly fall in love with you at first sight.
Oh, wait. That didn't happen, did it?
she will, or I promise you there will be suffering.
finally something we both can agree on.
good luck, Gold.
Oh, and, uh...
give my best to Lacey.
ten bowls of chili. No beans.
you and the dwarves got something against beans?
Oh, let's just say we've had our fill over the past couple weeks.
what exactly are you boys up to, anyway?
just a little landscaping.
is this seat taken?
you might wanna run along. I need to chat with the prince.
it's all right, Leroy. I got this.
what do you want to chat about, Gold?
Regina. She, uh, helped jog Belle's memory.
that's good, then. - No, no. Wrong memories.
she now thinks she's a scantily clad barfly named Lacey.
she has a false life, as you did under the curse with Kathryn, only hers apparently involves a lot more alcohol.
what do you want with me?
I want to know how you did it.
even when both your heads were filled with false memories,
david Nolan still won Mary Margaret's heart.
you want me to help you?
well, I'm certainly not here for the overpraised lasagna.
you got my wife to murder someone.
someone who would have killed all of you.
look, if you don't wanna help, that's fine.
but if you do, for the first time ever,
I'm gonna owe you a favor.
all right.
when Regina cursed Mary Margaret and me, there was still a sliver of Snow and Charming.
the real us inside.
and so how do I bring back the real Belle?
show her the man she fell in love with.
I'll try not to be too loud.
I can't promise the same courtesy from our prisoner.
where is he?
gone. I let him go.
what? He was a thief!
which doesn't give you the right to kill him.
it gives me every right!
Oh, let me guess.
you think he's a hero, stealing from me for some noble cause.
you read too many books, dearie!
maybe that'll stop filling your head with poisonous thoughts!
I didn't free him because of what I read in my books.
I saw good in him.
that man only wanted to escape with his life.
Oh, is that what you thought?
our thief escaped with more than his life.
you were tricked. You foolish, gullible girl!
there must be an explanation.
we... we don't know why he needed that wand.
he took the wand because he wanted magic!
people who steal magic never have good intentions!
no. No.
you can't tell what's in a person's heart until you truly know them.
Oh, we'll see what's in his heart, all right.
when I shoot an arrow straight through it.
and because I am a showman...
it'll be with his bow.
and because this is your fault, you get to come with me and watch, and know as the blood drips from his carcass it'll be you and your rags to wipe it up!
another round for the lady.
I've had my eye on you for a while.
thank you. Not my type.
well, you never know unless you give me a chance.
you might wanna wait outside. - Yeah, yeah, bad idea.
come on.
Mr. Gold. You're, uh, you're back.
as are you.
well, what can I say? Love the ambiance.
what the bloody hell is that?
let's get some "Panama" going on in here.
you, uh, you like Van Halen?
you're a hagar man, aren't you?
what are you doing? - We have nothing in common.
that doesn't matter. You just need a way in. Ask her out.
go on.
uh, Lacey? - Yeah?
now that you're...back to your old self, perhaps we could spend some time together.
like a date?
Yes, a date.
well, you do know that I'm not this Belle that you're always talking about?
Yes, of course.
I've heard about you, you know.
people in town, they're afraid of you, Mr. Gold.
don't let that deter you. Give me a chance, please.
okay. Tonight. Granny's. 8: 00.
not bad, Don Juan.
don Juan was nothing before he made his deal with me.
regardless, you got her to go out with you.
Congrats. - Indeed.
now I just need her to fall in love with me.
reading up on Henry's father?
or maybe his grandfather?
how long did you think you can keep that from me?
well, I was going to tell you, but I was kind of busy trying to stop you and your mother from killing me and my entire family.
what is he doing here? - Neal?
relax. He just wants to spend a little time with his son.
funny, he didn't seem to want to spend time with him the first ten years of his life.
but then again, neither did you.
you know what, Regina?
how about instead of worrying about everyone else, you start focusing on trying to be the person Henry wants you to be before you lose him for good?
"for good?" What does that mean?
nothing.
unlike you, the rest of the world isn't always scheming to get what they want.
no.
you're hiding something.
well, whatever it is, I can assure you of one thing.
I'm going to find out.
are you, uh... are you nervous, Mr. Gold?
no, no. Of course not. I'm just, uh, deciding what to have.
what the hell happened to you? You raid the back of Ruby's closet?
perhaps Lacey and I could order.
um, two burgers, two iced teas, please.
actually I'm gonna go chicken parm and white wine.
and make it the bottle.
all righty. Coming up.
I've never really been much of a burger girl.
well, whatever you want, you shall have.
you know, you... you're a classy guy, Mr. Gold.
this is not what I was expecting from you, given all the...stuff people say about you.
Oh, that again. My reputation.
what is it you hear?
Oh, just that, you know, you're the most powerful man in town, and you got that power from being ruthless.
and that when people cross you, they... get hurt.
thank you.
I am simply a shop owner, and procurer... of difficult-to-find objects.
people like to believe the worst in me, but, Lacey, I... I would rather you believe the best.
I... I just... I... I just don't get why people are scared of you.
you know, I see a man who wouldn't hurt anyone.
thank you, Lacey. I really needed to hear that. Especially now.
well, you know what they say.
you can't tell what's in a person's heart until you truly know them.
did I say something wrong? - No, no. It... it's just that...
I... I knew someone once who said that exact same thing to me.
gosh, I'm so sorry. Your dress...
a bit of water will take it right out.
okay.
I'm losing track of him. This forest is too thick.
maybe we should return home.
what, and let the thief escape?
what would people think if I spared the life of someone who stole from me?
that there's actually a man hiding behind the beast?
there isn't.
then why didn't you kill me when I freed the prisoner?
well, I would have, but, uh, good help these days is really hard to find.
I think that you are not as dark as you want people to believe.
I think that deep down, there's love in your heart.
and for something more than power.
you're right.
there is something I love.
my things!
you really are as dark as people say.
no, darker, dearie. Much darker.
what are you doing in my woods?
pardon the intrusion, sheriff.
uh, I'm looking for a thief. He attacked me with this bow.
uh, I... I traced him as far as these woods, and then he vanished.
Yes, I know exactly who you're after.
but I also know who you are, Rumplestiltskin.
my reputation precedes me. Excellent.
Yes, as does your penchant for making deals.
I'll tell you where you can find your thief...
if you give me something in return.
what do you want?
a night with your wench.
she's not for sale.
you can't part with her for, say, an hour? 20 minutes?
let me think.
I propose a new deal.
I give you this back, and in return, you tell me everything you know about the man I am hunting.
you ought to be more careful with your possessions.
do you agree to my terms?
what was that?
all right, I'll take that as a "yes" then.
start talking.
the thief that you're after... I've been chasing him for years.
he ruined me!
he stole the woman I love and...
made me the laughingstock of all of Nottingham.
where can I find him?
well, the last I heard, he was hiding out in Sherwood Forest.
and his name?
Robin Hood.
he goes by "Robin Hood."
you, uh, you know it's still not too late to turn back.
you know, I am not going to stand by and watch you kill a man.
well, you're welcome to sit if you like, but you are gonna watch.
that's the whole point of our little expedition, remember?
to see what your actions wrought.
found him.
look, he's... he's waiting for someone.
that woman.
that must be the one he stole from the sheriff.
she's sick. She's going to die.
Yeah, and so is he. - Stop!
I'm right about him, about why he stole the wand.
he did it so he could heal the woman he loves.
he's still a thief. - And she would have died if he hadn't stolen your wand.
and now he gets to die!
and she can tell all of Sherwood Forest what happens when you cross Rumplestiltskin.
there!
that should give you a good view.
you don't have to do this. There's good in you.
I was right about the thief, and I am right about you.
look, she's pregnant.
you are not the kind of man to leave a child fatherless.
No!
we've been found. Marian, we must go.
what happened?
I missed.
get back to the carriage. I'm bored of this forest.
you're... you're not going after him?
he's not worth the effort.
you spared his life. - What?
I did nothing of the sort.
that bow has magic in it. It never misses its target.
well, perhaps the magic just simply wore... off.
aren't you coming?
what the hell do you think you're doing? !
wait, you two are here together? - Yes, we are.
I... I'm sorry. I... I... I didn't know.
go! Now!
are you... are you all right? - Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.
let's get you inside. - No! Look, I said I'm fine, okay? I'm...
you came out here because you wanted to be with him?
Yeah.
but I don't understand. Our date... I thought it was... it was going well.
no. No, it... it wasn't.
what? - It never was.
the only reason I agreed to go out with you was because I was trying to be nice.
but that's not me. That's... that's you.
but that's what you liked about me...
the nice part of me, the... the good part.
this is still about Belle, isn't it?
look, Mr. Gold, I'm sorry. She may have loved you.
but I am not her.
no, you're not.
sure you don't wanna grab some grub with us? Tiny's buyin'.
I am?
new guy always buys.
you guys go ahead. We're gonna... we're gonna head on home.
see you tomorrow!
but I don't have any money.
no, really. I don't even know what you guys...
m... mister... Mr. Gold, I'm...
I'm so sorry about what happened back there.
I... I... I didn't know that you two were still together.
we're not.
Oh, so we're good then, right?
there's no hard feelings?
you know, I have tried so hard to be on my best behavior.
but I guess there's no point now.
looks like you won't be needing that bow anymore.
actually, I think I'll hold onto it.
you never know.
could come in handy someday.
well, uh, if you don't need me for anything else, good night, Rumplestiltskin.
no, wait.
there is something else.
temper your excitement, dearie.
this is merely another room for you to clean.
it's... it's beautiful.
there's more books in here than I could read in a lifetime.
well, I hope you can clean faster than you can read.
did you do all this for me?
I better not see a single speck of dust gathering on any of these books.
what are you smiling at? I'm serious.
you're not who I thought you were.
and I'm glad.
I should have done this to you a long time ago.
so it is true then, what they say about you.
Yes. It's all true.
you are... you are not who I thought you were.
and I'm glad.
you really are as dark as people say.
darker, dearie. Much darker.
what, did you tranquilize him?
I just gave him a couple bourbons. Kid's a real lightweight.
sounds like you guys had a full day.
spent most of it at the park.
he's getting pretty good with those wooden swords.
I guess that makes sense, considering where his family's from.
what?
you ever thought about going back?
back where?
home. Where we're from.
I spend most of my life trying to forget that place.
I didn't exactly have a fairy-tale childhood.
you know what I mean. Why do you ask?
no reason.
august came by the park today. He and Henry seemed to really hit it off.
that is gonna take a while to get used to.
you know, I gotta say, he's actually a lot cooler as a kid.
steals less of my money.
he'd be way cooler if he could remember what he was trying to warn us about before he got...
Rebooted?
Storybrooke isn't safe? Isn't safe from who?
well, he always had a knack for being cryptic.
don't worry about it. You'll figure it out.
if there's one thing I know about you, you don't stop till you find what you're looking for.
Hey, beautiful. We all good?
better than good.
now should we unwrap the package?
you think he'll cooperate?
wouldn't worry about that. From what I know of him, I don't think he'll need much convincing to help us.
what makes you say that?
because if there's one person you can always count on to do your dirty work...
it's a pirate.
turn to your right.
that's it, sir, you're done. Please follow the orange line.
we processed the film we found in your bag.
they're not very pretty pictures.
also, you left the camera in the hotel.
we processed that roll as well.
can I see them? - That's not a courtesy, Mr. Parrish, this is evidence.
do you guys have your own lab, or do you have to send it out?
we have a lab.
your legal aide should be here within 30 minutes or so.
you don't have to talk to me until she gets here if you don't want to.
you know that, Sy?
good.
sy, can I ask you one question? - Sure.
what was it about William Yorkin that upset you so?
I mean, what did he do to provoke all of this?
family photos depict smiling faces.
births, weddings, holidays...
happy birthday!
children's birthday parties.
people take pictures of the happy moments in their lives.
someone looking through our photo album would conclude that we had led a joyous, leisurely existence free of tragedy.
no one ever takes a photograph of something they want to forget.
we're gonna go.
sure you don't need my help? - Yeah.
sorry, kiddo, I gotta work. - Doesn't matter!
I'll get takeout for dinner, okay? - Okay.
see you. - See you.
Jake, are you coming, or what? - I'm coming!
there's one. - Okay.
can I look at toys?
for a minute. I'm just dropping off some film. Make sure you can see me.
okay.
Hey, Mrs. Yorkin. - Hey, Yoshi, how are you?
how have you been? - We're doing good, thanks.
got three rolls today. - Okay.
can I get the address? - It's...
I'll take care of Mrs. Yorkin. What have we got today?
two rolls, and I think I've got one in here as well.
can I have two prints of each, please?
leica Minilux.
that's a very nice camera.
Really? Will's trying to get me to go digital...
don't do that. I'd be out of a job.
you have one shot left. - That's okay.
it's a shame to waste it. - It's fine.
no, please, I look horrible.
how's Jake doing? - He's great.
he just had a birthday, and...
how old is he, nine?
that's right, he just turned nine. - Nine.
there we go. Got a winner.
Thanks.
when do you need these by? - Can I have them today?
we close at 7: 00 on Sundays.
well, it's not important. I can swing by tomorrow.
you're one of our best customers.
I'll have them for you by the time we close.
thank you so much. - No, problem.
I'll do some shopping. - See you in 40 minutes.
Thanks, Sy. Bye. - Bye.
Hey, Jake.
you sliced through an exposure on that last roll.
Yes, Yoshi, I know. I made a mistake.
Mrs. Levitt has a problem, offer her a free roll of film.
all right.
I've been doing P.O.S. mini-lab work for over 20 years now.
I consider it an important job.
when houses are on fire, what's the first thing people save after their pets and loved ones?
the family photos.
some people think this is a job for a clerk.
they actually believe that any idiot attending a two-day seminar can master the art of making beautiful prints in less than an hour.
but of course, like most things, there's far more to it than meets the eye.
I've seen the prints they fob off on people at the Rexall or Fotek.
milky, washed-out prints.
too dark prints.
there's no sense of reverence for the service they're providing people.
I process these photos as if they were my own.
I see someone had quite a birthday party.
I did them 5-by-7 for you.
I wanted them 4-by-6.
the larger ones are better. I didn't charge you extra for them.
it's okay, I guess.
how much do I owe you? - $30. 06. But let's call it an even 30.
all right, thanks.
we have a gift for birthday boys. - Really?
that's right. Birthday boys get a free camera.
Jake, what do you say?
Thanks.
you're welcome, buddy.
we're taking Jake to Six Flags, so...
I'll see you very soon. - See you.
come on, Jake. - Bye.
see you, Jake.
what a cool camera? - Yeah.
good night, A. J.
that's just great.
look, this is a great shot.
nice truck. - I remember that.
you guys are so cute. - This is a funny picture.
that is so sweet. This one's going into the trash.
Oh, my God. Look at your face, that's classic.
I need that back. - You're not getting it back.
I'm serious. - Don't give her it.
better give it to her. - No.
she's serious. She's serious.
Hey! - Hey!
told you.
how'd this one get in here?
Oh, that's Sy. - Sy?
sy the photo guy. - Sy took it to finish off the roll.
great. Now we have a picture of Sy the photo guy.
all right, guys, it's so past your bedtime, come on.
can I get you anything else? - No, thanks, just the check's fine.
what you got there, family photos? - Yeah.
you mind if I take a look?
these are beautiful. That's a good shot.
these your relations?
Yes. That's my little nephew, Jake. - He's a handsome boy.
isn't he? Yeah, I got him a camera for his birthday.
you must be his favorite uncle, then. - Oh, I don't know.
sure I can't get you no more coffee, then?
Oh, no. I'm fine, thanks. - Have a nice night, now.
you, too.
mom?
what, pookie?
I feel bad for someone.
somebody at school?
no.
what do you mean, you feel bad?
when someone seems sad, they don't have any friends and people make fun of them, that makes me feel bad for them.
who is sad and doesn't have any friends?
the photo guy at the one-hour place? - Yeah.
Oh, Jake. - I really feel bad for him.
but, Jake, we don't know that Sy is sad.
we really don't know that much about him, you know.
I mean, he might even have a lot of friends.
and he probably has a girlfriend and a mommy and a daddy who love him.
I don't think he does.
that is so sweet of you to think of somebody else like that, you know.
listen, Jake, not everybody is as lucky as we are.
you know?
but maybe if we send them good thoughts, it'll make them feel better.
so why don't we close our eyes and send Sy some good thoughts?
okay. - Okay? All right.
ready? - Yeah.
there.
I bet next time we see Sy, he won't seem so sad.
okay.
you have to go to sleep, pookie. - Okay.
I love you.
good night. - Good night.
there you go. Come on.
how do you think we pay for all this? I'm just asking you.
you think a money fairy slips an envelope under my pillow every month?
what are you even talking about? - All of this stuff.
the new Mercedes, the maching washer and dryer, the fucking Jil Sander blouse you have on now. How?
I love you, Nin, I do.
but if you want our life to look like something out of a magazine,
I'm sorry, I've gotta work to make that happen.
do you even believe what you're saying?
this is not about things, Will.
and it's not about money.
you're neglectful.
do you understand that? - What?
you're an emotionally neglectful husband.
and you're an emotionally neglectful father.
got it now? - That's fucking great. Neglectful?
you're not here, Will. You're not here.
you're never here.
I'm going to bed.
if in your mind...
Ban', what's wrong with you?
Oh, my God! Someone's trying to kill me!
Oh, wait, it's for Bart.
who'd wanna hurt me? I'm this century's Dennis the Menace.
it's probably the person you least suspect.
that's good, Dad.
monday is our busiest day.
people shoot most of their pictures on weekends.
the store has several regular customers.
there's Mrs. Von Unwerth, who only takes pictures of her cats.
I've never seen a picture of a human being. Just cats.
two copies, please, Mr. Parrish.
there's Mr. Siskind. Mr. Siskind is an insurance claims adjuster.
he only brings in pictures of wrecked cars.
the usual, Sy. I need these by 3: 00.
we get all the new parents, which makes up a big part of our business.
new parents go photo-crazy.
I don't know how many rolls I have here.
Cindy, a nurse from a nearby cosmetic-surgery clinic, is a regular.
we do all the before and after shots.
Thanks, Sy.
then there's the amateur porn artists.
we have to report kiddie porn and animal cruelty.
but anything else, no questions asked.
how many prints do you need of these? - Just one set is fine.
sy, are you kidding me? - What?
I've got three of these fucking machines down today.
I've gotta be in Heber Springs by 3: 00.
Larry, all I'm asking you to do is look at these prints.
plus . 3? Sy, are you fucking kidding me?
point three? Nobody cares until the shift's in double digits.
it's blue, Larry.
well, I'll bet Brandt cares about a plus . 3.
are you fucking threatening me?
you're breaking my balls over a plus-three blue shift?
fucking asshole.
next time you call me out here, that thing better be belching fire.
that's a great attitude, Larry. Thanks for your precision work!
what the hell you doing?
excuse me?
what was the deal with you and the Agfa guy?
I'm preserving a level of quality for my customers.
your customers.
he thinks that a plus . 3 shift to cyan is insignificant. It's massive.
sy, let me try and explain something to you one more time.
you need to look again at your place on the food chain.
these aren't your customers, they're Sav-Mart's.
if you haven't noticed, this isn't Neiman Marcus.
people come here with their kids for a good time and to save on paper towels and socks.
if they wanted to see yelling, they'd stay at home.
it was wrong to create a scene in front of customers. It won't happen again.
sy, don't you have some vacation time saved up?
I guess I probably do.
you should take some time off, go down to a Club Med.
you know, relax, lay in the sun. Enjoy life.
I'll think about that, Bill.
your lunch break ended a half-hour ago. What the hell you been doing in here?
I'm trying to figure out if this will work with my Mac.
I'm sorry. This isn't my section.
you're Will Yorkin. - Yeah?
sy Parrish. I'm the photo tech here.
I do all your family's pictures.
Oh, right. Sy the photo guy.
right.
here you are in the flesh. - Yeah.
it's just I don't see you in here too often.
Nina usually does most of the shopping.
can you help me with this?
this is computers. I do photo finishing. It's not my section.
I'm in a rush and I had one question I needed answered.
no problem. I'll get someone. - Thanks.
customer needs immediate assistance, aisle four. Customer assistance, aisle four.
someone will be here soon. - Great.
you got it.
so is the rest of the family here?
Jake's around here somewhere.
you're a very lucky man, Mr. Yorkin.
I'm sorry?
you have a wonderful family.
and if you don't mind my saying so, a very beautiful house, too.
well, thank you, Sy. I appreciate that.
I really need to get this stuff and get the hell out of here.
I understand.
thanks for all your help. - Oh, it's okay.
you say hello for me. - I will do.
I gotta get back. There'll be someone here in...
there you go.
great. It doesn't say if this will work for a Mac.
no. This is PC only. We have some Mac-based stuff down here.
Jake! - Hi.
I was just talking to your dad.
what do you have there? - Evangelion.
neon Genesis Evangelion.
what does he do?
he's a good guy, he can fly and he has a silver sword that can kill bad guys.
Really? - Yeah. And he's 60 feet tall.
you really want this, don't you? - Yeah.
Yeah, well... - Jake.
no more toys, we're leaving. - Gotta go.
I'll put this back for you. - Thanks.
see you. - See you later.
I told you not to talk to strangers.
I'm sure my customers never think about it, but these snapshots are their little stands against the flow of time.
the shutter is clicked, the flash goes off, and they've stopped time, if just for the blink of an eye.
and if these pictures have anything to say to future generations, it's this:
I was here.
I existed.
I was young. I was happy
and someone cared enough about me in this world
to take my picture.
how much for this one?
most people don't take snapshots of the little things:
the used Band-Aid, the guy at the gas station, the wasp on the Jell-O.
but these are the things that make up the true picture of our lives.
people don't take pictures of these things.
you really have to tidy up your room, pal.
I'll bet your mother's told you a thousand times.
it's a good game.
Hi, Sy. - You said you were going out today.
uncle Sy.
can you help me put this together?
SY'. How many prints would you like?
just one set.
Maya, that's a very beautiful name.
thank you.
have you picked up prints here before? - Maybe once, a long time ago.
your face looks very familiar.
you work around here?
sort of near here.
I've probably seen you at the mall. - I'm in here pretty often.
we're backed up today. Is 6: 00 okay?
I won't be able to pick them up till tomorrow or the next day.
see you then. - Thanks.
come on! A little hustle.
here we go. Right there.
come on.
good shot. That's the way to strike the ball.
get in front of those, son.
Jake, visualize where you want the ball to go and drill it.
good one, Jake.
Jake, that's not good enough. We have to work on that.
pay attention, fellas. A little focus.
drill it in there, Matt, come on! Good shot.
next practice, Thursday. If you can't make it, tell Derrick.
Hey, Jake. - Hi.
Tobey, you forgot your sweatshirt.
on my way home, I saw you out there. I thought I'd check it out.
Jake. You all right? - Yeah.
is your mom picking you up?
no, I got my bike.
it's a great shot you made. Your coach was a little rough.
he should be more supportive.
want me to have a word with him? - That's okay.
I will. - No, thanks.
okay.
when I was your age, I wasn't very good at sports.
I was kind of a chubby kid.
let's face it. I was fat.
I was sick all the time.
kept coming down with mono and hepatitis.
then I broke my collarbone and had a weird cast that kept my arm up like this all winter.
I wasn't exactly the most popular kid.
how'd you break your collarbone?
I fell out of a tree.
how's your dad doing? - Good.
does he come to see the games? - Yeah, sometimes.
does he come to any games?
he's really busy at work. I don't know, he's busy all the time.
sounds like an important guy.
I guess. He owns a company and everything.
probably wants you and your mom to have nice things like that cool bike and those soccer shoes. Hold on.
those things cost money.
he'd be here if he could.
I guess.
I got something for you.
wanna guess what it is?
what's wrong? It's the one you wanted.
Mr. Parrish, I can't take this.
sure you can, Jake.
my parents wouldn't let me.
I'd better be getting back home now.
you sure? - Yeah, thanks anyway, Mr. Parrish.
see you around the store. - Okay.
Hey, Jake. The name's Sy. - Okay, Sy.
well, there's been, like, some kind of shift.
I don't know.
a couple of weeks?
maybe five weeks.
six.
no, I know that, but...
Yeah, but this feels different, you know?
listen, Jan, I can't talk right now. I'll call you back this afternoon.
okay. I know. I love you, too. Bye.
Hi, Sy. - Hi, there.
I was at the Dairy Queen. I saw you and thought I'd say hello.
I'm just grabbing some shopping fuel. - I never see you away from the store.
you'd think we'd run into each other. - Why, do you live around here?
I live downtown.
well, that's quite a drive. - No, I'm used to it.
you have a nice boy there. - Oh, Jake. Yeah.
a little sensitive, maybe. He likes you.
he calls you "Sy the photo guy.
I've known him since he was this big.
that's right. You've been doing our pictures for a long time.
you know, I almost feel like "Uncle Sy."
well, I've got some serious shopping to do.
Oh, sure.
take care.
Oh, my God. - What?
it's so weird. I'm reading that exact book right now.
you're kidding.
no, I can't believe that you'd be reading that book.
he writes a lot about noticing coincidence, doesn't he?
Yeah, he does.
that thing he says about fear...
the things we fear the most have already happened to us.
I had no idea you were such a deep thinker, Sy.
I wouldn't say that.
do you have any children, Sy? - Me? No. No, I'm not married.
no girlfriend? - No.
I have a snapshot of my mother, though.
she looks very nice. - She's passed away.
Oh, well...
I'm sorry, Sy.
gosh, you know, I have to go.
it was really nice chatting with you. - It was nice chatting with you.
I'll probably see you soon. We can't go a day without taking a picture.
lucky for us.
okay. Bye, Sy. - Bye.
sy Parrish, please see the manager.
sy to the manager's office immediately, please.
what's with the getup? - It's Wednesday. I was doing the SRS.
there's been some discrepancies in the click count.
that's Yoshi. His math skills are weak. I told you that when you moved him.
the discrepancies are on logs you initialed.
they are? - Yeah.
I guess sometimes at the end of the week, you get a little tired...
we're not talking a few innocent math errors.
the net-clicks all zero out. They always zero out.
the problem is the shut-down clicks don't correspond.
they don't come close to matching the amount of prints we've sold.
then it's probably the reorder counter.
well, I asked Larry about that. - What did he say?
he looked at the counter and said that it checked out.
also, in 14 years of servicing, he's never seen a faulty counter on an Agfa.
Really?
the question is, where did all those unaccounted-for prints go?
what's the discrepancy, Bill?
we're talking hundreds of prints, Sy.
that's not possible, Bill.
I've done the math. The P.O.'s confirm it, too.
I don't know anything about it.
well, I think you do, Sy.
well, I don't, Bill.
look, Sy, I've got a family.
I'm not losing my job over this.
I'm letting you go.
no.
these discrepancies would be enough, but you're spacing out, taking 90-minute breaks, creating scenes, - giving away free merchandise. - What?
free disposable cameras to customers on their birthday?
sure as shit isn't company policy.
you can't do this. - It's done.
I talked to Sims at district. Finish out the week and clear out your locker.
if you do something like fuck up the prints...
I haven't fucked up a customer's prints in 11 years.
just get back out there.
Hey, Sy.
Jake wanted to get his birthday gift processed.
I'm sorry?
the camera?
right. The birthday gift.
number of sets? - Just one is fine.
4-by-six, 5-by-7?
the ones we usually get.
standard.
Jake had a great time with the camera, didn't you?
Yeah. - Yeah.
what was that address again?
sy, are you all right?
I'm fine.
I'll have these for you tomorrow.
all right. Thanks, Sy.
Bye.
Bye.
I'm leaving early today, Yoshi.
okay, Sy.
I won't be coming back, Yoshi. Bill let me go.
you were fired? - Yep.
Really? - Really.
I've really enjoyed working with you, Yoshi.
Yeah, me, too, Sy.
sy, I just wanted to...
I guess I just wanted to say thank you.
for what?
for teaching me all this stuff.
you're welcome, Yoshi.
don't let the place go downhill, okay? - I won't, Sy.
here they are. - My pictures. Let me see.
come on.
come on.
what the hell's wrong with these people?
the universe grows smaller every day.
there must be security for all, or no one is secure.
it is no concern of ours how you run your own planet.
but if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder.
now, we do not pretend to have achieved perfection.
but we do have a system, and it works.
your choice is simple: Join us and live in peace or pursue your present course and face obliteration.
we shall be waiting for your answer.
the decision rests with you.
according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word "snapshot" was first used in 1808
by an English sportsman by the name of Sir Andrew Hawker.
he noted in his diary that almost every bird he shot that day was taken by snapshot, meaning a hurried shot, taken without deliberate aim.
"Snapshot," then, was originally a hunting term.
can I help you?
just dropping off some film. Just a customer.
I can still shop here, can't I? - No, you can't still shop here.
I believe I can.
there's no law that says I can't shop here because I was fired.
I checked. - There's other places to do photos.
there's no reason to come here other than to fuck with me.
there's a good reason.
I calibrated that machine personally. It's the best mini-lab in the state.
all right, Sy. Just this one time.
but find another place to do your film. I do not want you back in here.
Thanks, Bill.
what is it? You can't just leave your station unmanned.
you need to see these, sir. - Is it the anal sex fiend again?
motherfucker.
what was Mr. Parrish's demeanor when he came in?
demeanor? - Yeah.
how did he seem? Did he seem upset or agitated in any way?
I don't know, he seemed fine. - Sy and I had words when he came in.
I was surprised to see him, and asked him what he was doing here.
I suggested in strong language that he bring his pictures somewhere else.
I need Xerox copies of this.
can you show me where I get that done? - Yeah.
Mr. Owens, why don't you grab a seat and try to calm down?
your wife and child, they're somewhere safe now?
they're at my mother's. I'm sorry. I'm a little upset.
no, no, no, no. I understand. It's understandable.
so how did he take his being fired?
I've fired a lot of people. People get upset when they get fired.
he got pretty upset.
he knew Mr. Araki would show the photos to you and that you'd call us.
I think it's just a warning.
you have to take it seriously. - We take it very seriously.
your child's life was indirectly threatened. We take no chances.
there's an APB on him.
officers are en route to his home with a search warrant.
I have officers inside the store and out.
he may come back and pick up his photos. He may not.
it's hard to say. I doubt he will.
is that a good idea? This place is wall-to-wall families.
if he's stupid enough to come back, he'll never make it inside the store.
are you insane?
Mr. Parrish? This is the police.
if you're in the apartment, we need to know right now.
kill that TV.
Mr. Parrish!
it's clear.
officer Lyon. Double 6, 321.
go ahead, 321.
I need to be patched through to Van Der Zee in TMU. Right away.
321, that's a 10-4.
Hey, Dan, take a look at this.
what do you got?
I'm sorry, sir. I don't find that name registered.
could you try a Maya Burson? B-U-R-S-O-N.
let me check that for you, sir.
I'll ring that room for you now, sir. - Thank you.
Hello? - Hello. This is room service.
sorry to bother you, but we have your order ready.
we need to know if you'd like coffee with that.
will, did you want coffee?
no, just the drinks.
and this is for room 217.
no, we're 511, right? We're 511.
511. Oh, my gosh. I must be looking at the wrong thing here.
I'm sorry. We'll have it up in just a minute.
okay. Thanks.
hotel operator.
room service, please. - One moment, please.
room service, this is Jon. May I take your order?
Jon, this is Will Yorkin in 511.
we've decided to go out for lunch. I'd like to cancel our order.
no problem. That was 511?
right. Thank you very much.
you're welcome, Mr. Yorkin.
yes? - Nina Yorkin?
Yes. - I'm Detective Van Der Zee of the Threat Management Unit. This is Detective Outerbridge.
threat Management? Is Jake all right?
everyone's fine. We actually need to speak with your husband.
will's at work. What's this about?
you mind if we come in for a minute?
no. Sure.
how can I help you, sir? - Hi.
I need a room. But not too high a floor.
I'll check, sir.
Yes, we can offer you 313.
anything on five?
I'll check, sir.
DUANE'. Will Yorkin's office.
it's Nina. I need to talk to Will.
he's not in. I'll have him return when he gets back.
Duane, get him on the phone immediately. This is an emergency.
I'll try him now. I'll put you on hold.
no, Duane...
he's trying him right now.
Where's your son?
he's at his friend Eric's house.
it might be a good idea to have Eric's mother drive him home.
Oh, my God.
Mrs. Yorkin? - Yes, Duane.
there was no answer, but I left him a 911 page. He'll call you...
I know he's fucking Maya Burson. I don't care about that now.
I just need you to tell me where he is!
I want a glass of water.
get it yourself.
room service.
can you just leave it outside the door, please?
no, ma'am. I'm afraid you have to sign for this.
just a second.
you. Get on the bed.
get on the goddamn bed!
I've got plenty of cash in my pants... - Shut up!
close the drapes. Close them!
good.
who said to do that? - I closed the drapes.
to wrap a towel around yourself? - No.
let me explain what's going on here.
I tell you to do things.
then you do them exactly like I tell you.
I'm gonna tell you this one time and one time only. You got the picture?
Yeah.
do you understand me? - Yes.
good. Now, get on the bed.
No!
Jesus.
am I talking to a brick wall?
did I tell you to touch her?
no. - I don't want you to touch her.
if you touch her again, I stab you in the heart.
proceed to Deerfield, the Edgerton Hotel, Hunter Valley Road.
TMU officers en route to scene.
can you ring the room again? - I'll try one more time.
now, Missy. You have to take the robe off.
no.
I'm not asking, I'm telling.
off!
she can do it!
the person in this room is not available.
please leave a message...
what's this? What's this?
can't you stop your sniveling?
this is supposed to look like fun.
okay.
no touching!
smile.
you have to look like you're having fun, like it's a game.
come on!
smile!
wipe your nose. You look disgusting.
now. Put his thing in your mouth.
don't do it!
pretend. This is all pretend!
I'm doing it! Stop yelling at me!
you're not doing it the right way. Like this! - No!
No!
Mr. Belmer? - Yes.
detectives Van Der Zee and Outerbridge. We spoke earlier.
right. So, what is all this about?
any word from Miss Burson yet? - No.
have you seen this man?
he checked in about half an hour ago. - What room?
I put him in 519.
I need a pass key. Now, please.
Mr. Parrish, this is the police. Will you open the door?
the retinal implant is a microelectronic prosthesis that can reverse the effects of retinal degeneration.
we owe a...
let's find Yorkin.
check 511.
Bravo? Where is it? Where is it?
it's the rear kitchen access.
it's in the back, rear kitchen access.
miss Burson?
police! Freeze!
drop the bag!
do it!
put your hands on top of your head.
miss Burson?
I just took pictures.
you have the right to remain silent.
if you give up the right to remain silent, anything you...
Outerbridge? We got him.
the attorney present during questioning.
if you so desire and cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed...
dad!
are you married, detective? You have any children?
I'll be the one asking the questions. - I know. Just one question.
are you a family man?
that's none of your business. - You're right. It isn't.
it is none of my business. But I'm guessing by your answer and that ring on your finger that you are.
and that makes you a very fortunate man.
I can also tell by the way you've treated me and the way you do your job, you're a good man. A good husband and father, a man who appreciates his good fortune.
you're not the type of father who'd cheat on his wife, hurt his family, betray their trust.
you would never neglect and abuse your children.
make horrible demands of your children.
you would never ask...
you would never ask your children to do things...
things that children shouldn't do.
you would never take disgusting, sick, degrading pictures of your children doing these things!
you would never treat your children like animals.
will Yorkin had it all, and he threw it all away.
he is not a good father.
well, I...
I think I understand now, Sy.
thank you for answering my questions so candidly.
you're welcome.
can I see my pictures now?
sure, Sy.
thank you.
fools.
misfits.
Donkey-brained caricatures of men, you guaranteed me that Misgath would be chosen queen.
who is she? From whence did she come? Who are her people?
there is little known about her, my lord.
she is called Esther of Susa. An orphan.
we should've stuck to our first plan and poisoned Hagai ourselves.
quiet. - Poison?
he did not, my lord. He is far too impetuous.
far too... - You know about poison.
of course you do.
you were once the royal cupbearers.
suppose in theory, you wanted to poison another.
suppose... Suppose this other remained nameless, but was, in effect, one whom you had once vowed to protect.
my lord prince...
come, come. Don't look so distressed.
we plot nothing here.
my lord.
from India to Babylon, my sword has spilt the blood of traitors against the crown.
proud, arrogant "chosen ones."
allowed to return to their homeland.
but do they go?
do they?
thank you.
how wonderful are the ways of the Lord that he should have raised up my little Hadassah and made her queen.
have you told anyone our secret?
no.
if you continue to call me Hadassah, it will no longer matter.
will you not join me in the palace?
I could have you named to any post you desire.
my Lord will take care of me.
do you take care of your lord?
remember not his orders?
procure it not from the palace, so nothing can be traced back to us.
the Jews have apothecaries.
where is he now?
you, over there... - Why cannot a truce be arranged?
truce?
that devil Memucan has beaten me twice in a row.
I fear losing you.
I gave an oath to my father.
he's the one I fear losing you to.
you must dream. You'll be gone much in the coming months.
keep this for me.
but it is yours. I... - Then be at peace.
I always return for what is mine.
will thou sit there all day, my lord?
this one.
MORDECAl: Why would they buy belladonna off you?
maybe they seek to poison someone. Very deadly, very quick.
you sold them poison?
a Jew sells poison to the King's food tasters?
have you any idea for whom it might've been intended?
please, just allow me to see it.
the scribe says it is for the Queen's eyes only.
that is what she told.
a plot to kill the King.
the King should be notified at once, my lady.
he and Memucan are a day's ride away at the training grounds.
then it would be better, my lady, if I send for the captain of the guard - to investigate. - Who else is closest to the King?
Admantha.
this is treachery.
if my lady will permit, I myself will bring these two eunuchs to you.
I'm armed, so I doubt the need for force.
that will not be necessary.
the King's new captain of the guard has gone to investigate.
time was of the essence, my lady.
if only all shared your loyalty to the King, my prince.
captain of the guards.
master Haman, my lady.
what of the eunuchs?
they are being led to the gallows as we speak.
I found this about their person.
I interrogated them both.
I'm convinced they plotted alone.
make sure Mordecai's name is entered in the chronicles and that it is certified with my seal so he may be properly rewarded by the King.
ADMANTHA: Please, help yourself.
only a bite.
now I no longer ride the highways, my appetite suffers.
then may I assume that your fee for spying for me will be reduced?
my appetite may be less, not of my sons, my wife.
well, that may cost you more, my prince.
much, - much more. - What might you have done?
I would save the King for last.
as in the palace board game. Rid yourself first of all of those pieces that are closest to him.
one by one.
HEGAl: My lady, this is foolish. - I go with or without you.
there are too many rumors drifting through the palace, and not enough answers.
these hinges are well-oiled.
there must be plenty who use it.
lovers always find a way, my lady.
HAMAN: The time has come, my brothers and sisters, where we must root out those amongst our midst who seek our wreck and ruin!
when a field of crops is defiled by disease, do we not set it on fire?
I am asked why I choose to speak against these foreigners and strangers in our midst.
the Jew! - The Jew!
no, not the Jew.
I, myself, know many an individual Jew who I am proud to call friend, but put these individual Jews together, and what are Egypt,
assyria, Babylon in their wake?
lead me away from here, quickly.
you want proof?
proof!
pulled from the royal library, the great scheme of the Greeks and the Jews to conquer the world!
for let me tell you, the Greeks and the Jew both live by the same evil doctrine.
all men are created equal.
do you believe you are equal to a slave? - ALL: No!
HAMAN.; And you believe neither in the Jewish God, nor in Greek democracy, but there are others in the palace that do.
let me now speak of Memucan.
prince. General.
arch traitor!
for services rendered to King Darius.
pacification of the Babylonian provinces.
payments made to Haman the Agagite.
when? When?
ask of Memucan why he allowed the Greeks of Ionia to retain their democracy.
ask whose voice is loudest against the war today and you will find out it is he!
common year.
thirteen years ago.
HAMAN: My lady.
are you alone?
highly unsafe. - I was just finishing.
please.
allow me.
shall I return this for you? - Thank you.
something must weigh heavy on my queen's heart in order to be kept up at this hour, reading.
my queen.
is her Highness unwell? - I'm fine.
perhaps I should retire.
MEMUCAN: You're not scheduled at the palace for more than two weeks.
she'll be wonderfully surprised, think you not?
here, read this, my lord.
you do not appear to be a traitor, Memucan.
return with me, and I'll have Admantha investigate
Haman's accusations immediately.
haman is my appointment.
and we do need him more than we realize.
truly, Memucan, at one moment you sulk, you say your name has been slurred, now you plead for your accuser.
I have enough lives on my conscience.
chastise him mildly, and he will perform his duty well and be more grateful to you for your leniency.
spoken like a true Persian.
never judging a man before all the good and all the bad are weighed.
ride with me.
MORDECAl: So you burnt the evidence? - Worry not, action will still be taken.
lest you forget, this Haman is now head of internal protection.
and lest you forget, I'm still queen.
Yes, but queen subject to an ancient protocol that no doubt Haman knows how to manipulate far better than you do.
go not by the main gate.
I wish not for the Queen to be alerted to my coming.
you must promise me that you will not reveal this to anyone.
any more such promises and I shall have to take a vow of silence.
rusty old lovers' gate.
I trust you used it much in your youth, Memucan.
who do you think had it installed?
go now.
my love. Oh, how I've missed you.
have you? - Now, what is that supposed to mean?
you looked flushed. Busy morning?
not as busy as it could get.
no visitors?
you sent for me, Your Highness?
it appears you have misplaced our necklace.
I wonder if that is all you have misplaced.
perhaps Your Majesty would like to send for one of the concubines.
perhaps not.
you look so much like your father.
sometimes I forget how different you truly are.
makes me wonder all the more why you feel such need to follow in his steps.
give her a few more nights, and then have her brought to me.
ADMANTHA: You call that public tirade subtle?
you mock me, Agagite.
I need but report but once to the King of your arrogance.
and your dreams of kingship die with me.
you might be less harsh on the Jews.
you should make yourself a laughing stock.
the Jews, my prince, will be your chief weapon by which you attain power to the throne.
think, we plan to take the crown by force when the King is deep in Greece.
what excuse will you use?
who attacks the land?
well, no one, actually.
unless, of course, you claim it was the Greek-Ioving Jews.
Memucan expects an apology, as you predicted.
well, an apology is a cheap enough price to pay for a kingdom.
invite, then, Memucan to your estate.
presumably so I can apologize to him.
on the way, however, he will be ambushed.
ADMANTHA.; By whom? - By my Jews, of course.
jews who slew him for being coupled with them as a traitor.
and what of Memucan's own guard? - It's merely an apology.
perhaps you can suggest to Memucan that if he arrive with a large number,
I might suspect he'd come to punish me.
one or two guards my men can handle.
and who'll handle you?
who but you, my king.
prepare to die, Greek-Iover.
Admantha's men.
thank the gods you are unharmed, my lord.
XERXES: Come.
my queen...
man: Your Highness, blood has been spilled. You are needed at once.
but lord King, an accusation by a dispatch ride.
why did you wait so long to inform anyone of Admantha's plot?
surely you don't... - My lord, I had to but play the traitor to catch the traitor.
where are his witnesses, my lord? What were my motives?
let this Haman prove his words or be forever silent.
but what would he have me show, my lord?
there are no witnesses to plans forged in secret.
you will not act like that, Admantha.
and was it not even Admantha who stirred the crowd into demanding
queen Vashti's appearance, knowing she would not come?
all lies. That's lies.
lies. I stand in a crumbling house of lies.
remember before whom you plead. - Plead for what?
for your life, Admantha.
is it my foolish desire to believe these stories I hear or my glaring inability to perceive their mysteries?
perhaps you...
you placed them back upon the shelf to collect dust without ever truly completing them.
who is the one that gathers dust?
I believed I was your Rachel.
but it appears I'm only Leah, and you serve time with me for another.
no, my lord. It's not what you think.
nothing is as I think anymore.
plots slither through the night.
trust, it decays like secret gates left to rust.
Admantha is carried to torture even as we speak.
this Jacob and Rachel, they are no mere story to you.
give me some incentive to believe in who you really are.
give me some honor.
for if it is truly the honor of kings to seek out truth in lie,
I am a man of scorn.
I will answer you, my lord, if you first answer me.
answer you what?
why did you summon Vashti when you knew she would not come?
I am king.
and I need answer to no one.
MORDECAI.; After many days of torture, Admantha, the great Midian prince, finally confessed all, and was dealt with according to the protocol of the land.
for his brave and valorous services, Haman the Agagite was proclaimed a prince of the Fars to inherit Admantha 's house, wealth, prestige and power.
pieces are falling into place we've spoken of, one by one.
soothsaying does not become you, Haman.
no, my darling, I speak of the truth, not of stars.
my burden I would not wish on any man.
the blood of my forefathers will be avenged.
and the gods will smile down on our son through our obedience.
and are you mad? This is your plan?
it is not that our allies are unwilling, my lord, but they have not fared well.
a storm has robbed the Phoenicians of a good part of their fleet.
Carthage finds herself short in timber with which to complete our warships...
surely the fate of the empire does not hinge on money?
are you ready to furnish it, then? - No, not I, my lord.
but I'm aware of traitors within our borders that could.
the Jews? We are not children.
nevertheless, the money may be raised by the confiscation of Jewish wealth and property.
and the Jews will just hand it over without a fight?
no, of course not.
first we must kill them all.
every last one of them.
it is the only way to ensure they do not rise up and seek revenge.
he speaks of women and children, my lord.
Yes, women and children.
I know.
what is your solution?
or would you rather, my dear Memucan, the Greeks and the Jews unite and, hand in hand, murder us in our beds while we sleep?
is the past so mighty that we must destroy our brothers to be free of its grasp?
no kingdom was ever so grand as the Jews' own King Solomon.
he fought not one battle, toiled through not one war, but prospered upon the peace handed down by his father.
do not make void what your own father's death has purchased.
by picking back up... - Mind your tone, General.
why thirst you for warfare when we can drink so deeply of peace?
you speak of peace, let us speak of the Jews.
they would rather bow down to their own God than obey the laws of protocol.
their prophets even speak of a coming king.
a king who will reign over all kings and set all men free.
is that not the very essence of democracy, my dear Memucan?
I do believe, under your guidance, we are undone.
if we are undone, we are undone from within, indeed.
march upon Greece, if you wish.
but you march with no general in your lead.
then it has not yet been signed into law?
not as yet, my lady.
perhaps guilt stirs men too hotly at times, and they seek the salve of the law to ease the burning.
and what would you have me do?
I cannot seek him in the library unless summoned.
if you arrived first, then he in effect would be seeking you, would he not?
how came you pass my guard? I demanded none use the library this night.
I seek that which you seek, my lord.
truth.
perhaps the truth of what exists between us?
I have come on matters of state.
matters of state.
I see.
and what matters of state might that be?
you desire more perfumes? You request more condiments?
surely as queen of the kitchen, you need not await me here.
you know as well as I how quickly word travels throughout the palace.
especially when murder's involved.
you are... You are learned, well-read.
offer me a story that answers my dilemma.
I have never pretended with you. - Never pretended?
think you not that I see Memucan's strings dangling above your head even now?
you care more for these Jews than you do for me.
do you enquire of my burdens, do you offer me solutions?
no.
you just complain.
as Vashti did? - Away from me!
and come before me no longer, no matter what pretense you seek, or your fate shall be worse than Vashti.
but I do love you. - Love has failed me.
knowledge has failed me, thus I bind myself to the protocol of my fathers and to my empire.
by the next moon, I leave for war.
and whatever my fate, it shall no longer be shared with you.
this was once your favorite reading.
and though it may no longer bear the story of love, it bears that of one Mordecai the Jew.
one of whom you wish to destroy saved your life.
and you never even honored him for it.
the casting of the lot, the Pur...
it has determined upon which day all the Jews of the kingdom will be slain.
this day is to be the 13th day of the month of Adar according to the calendar of the Jews.
prince...
the annihilation of a people can only be authorized by one who bears the signet of the King himself.
MORDECAI.; And those letters were sent into all the land, to slay and annihilate all the Jews on the 13th of Adar, some six weeks hence.
both young and old, men, women and even children.
and to plunder all of their possessions for the sake of the crown.
the scribe insists that all is dependant upon you, my queen.
dependant upon me?
my queen might wish to go before the King and intercede for those that have no other hope.
my lady...
have you forgotten your protocol?
to approach the King unsummoned is death.
perhaps in court. But surely you can visit him in private.
in his chambers.
surely I cannot.
ESTHER.; Obedient I have been.
I walk before you with a loyal heart.
and now I stand in the hour of trouble precisely because of my obedience.
I beseech you, Father, let there be another way.
rise up a deliverer and let this pass.
let this pass.
MORDECAI.; " 'Comfort, "'comfort my people,' says your God.

the everlasting neither faints nor is weary.
his understanding no one can fathom.
he gives strength to the weary and power to the weak.
even the youth shall faint and be weary, "and young men shall utterly fail.
but those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength.
Lord, we wait on thee.
renew our strength.
Man.; Clear the way for he who comes.
kneel before the great prince.
clear the way for he who comes. Kneel for the great prince.
you...
lower yourself to honor the great Prince Haman. Kneel!
I said kneel. - Stop!
why do you not kneel? - I kneel before my king.
I abase myself only before the God of my fathers.
what's his name, this God? - The great I AM.
the one true God, the maker of heaven and earth.
the God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob.
a Jew.
mordecai Ben-Yair.
Mordecai...
I shall name my prize pig after you.
perhaps I may give you other reasons to remember my name.
you will remember mine for this!
move on.
man: What good did that do?
you still ended up on the ground like the rest of us.
but I did not kneel.
come, now, you are a mere three days from being handed a kingdom.
we must not let one Jew rob us of our joy.
that is not good enough.
then seek permission to honor the King's departure with a public execution of a rebel
a symbol of your authority over those that remain.
a gallows, 50 cubits high with Mordecai right...
the chronicles.
XERXES: Rise.
a matter disturbs me. You may be of assistance.
I am most pleased, my lord, for I, too, desire your counsel on a matter.
a certain man has rendered great service to me.
he has received many honors amongst his people, but he once saved my life.
I feel, despite everything, full recognition has not yet been given him.
what think you, shall be done for this man in whom the King delights to honor?
let a royal robe be sent for, one his Majesty has donned in public.
and a horse on whose head a royal crest is set.
deliver them to one of the noblest princes of the Fars, so that he can array the man in whom the King delights.
and then parade this man through the streets, proclaiming, "Thus shall it be done to the man in whom the King delights to honor.
most excellent proposal.
go yourself now and do all you have suggested.
my lord.
to a one Mordecai, the scribe who sits within the King's gates.
Mordecai?
the Jew?
my lady.
and who is this honored man? - A scribe.
a Jewish scribe, who claims to have saved the King's life.
I should think you would be honored by such a privilege given by the King.
honored?
the prestige of Persia is at stake.
what will it be said of your husband, the king, that he commands his highest prince to lead a Jew through the streets?
a Jew, my lady!
and how is a Jew any different than you or I?
they are our enemy.
they must be destroyed.
they may be your enemy, but not mine.
from the way that you defend them, - one might almost think... - One might think what, my prince?
one might think. That is all, my lady.
one might think.
HAMAN: Make your way for Mordecai, the Jew.
make your way for Mordecai, who saved the King's life.
he is the man in whom the King delights to honor.
all hail for Mordecai, the Jew, honored of the King.
beloved of the Queen. All hail for Mordecai, the Jew.
honored of the King. Beloved of the Queen.
guards...
my queen, I bring you word from Mordecai.
you've run out of time.
when the King leaves for Greece tomorrow, he will appoint Haman as his regent.
it is our last chance to stop this edict of death.
he made me vow to speak his words.
you will indeed risk your life if you go before the King...
MORDECAI.;... but do not think that if you keep silent your position will save you alone from this edict.
for if you keep silent, deliverance for the Jews will arise from someplace else, but you will surely perish.
who knows whether you have come to the palace for such a time as this?
he said to give you this.
tell Mordecai to assemble the Jews.
ask them to fast and pray.
I will do the same.
and in the morning, arrange for me a litter.
I will array myself as queen and go before the King unsummoned, even though it is against the law.
and if I perish,
I perish.
XERXES: People of Persia, servants of the crown, today we embrace our destiny to raid and rule the world over and stand against the Greeks and all who would rob us of our glory.
MAID: Her crown, quickly.
the litter will be here any moment.
no litter is coming. - What?
I do not know what you plan, but...
the King leaves for the outpost within the hour.
I have not time to wait out this rain.
I am not going to allow you to kill yourself.
no...
please tell me you did not. - What possible assurance do you have he would lower his scepter to spare your life?
you do not go into a bedroom of a man, you go into the hall of a king.
this is not you against him. This is you against protocol.
you against the empire.
then I... I go as
david did before Goliath and the Philistines.
those are just stories, Esther. Do you hear me? Just stories.
know you what I love most about the story of David and Goliath?
David's victory came not because he fought well but because he believed well.
thus I leave you on this day, your regent, in my absence,
lord Haman, prince of the Fars.
it is my will that each of you obey him in every way, exactly as you would regard your king.
unsummoned she comes before the King.
she does.
is protocol not broken?
Yes, protocol has been broken. - Guards!
...before the King.
we have not time to waste. - What did he say to your request?
the timing, the faces... I could not ask it.
not there, not in court.
what then? Do we perish?
we have but one last chance. You must help me prepare.
a king may lower his scepter to whoever he wishes.
my lord, this day your kingdom has all but been ripped from your hands.
this Esther has dishonored you more than Vashti ever could.
see not you now how she has trapped you?
inviting us to a banquet to hear her request?
if you go, the people will deem you to be a pawn.
if you refuse, a coward.
there is but one way to proceed.
is the meal to your satisfaction, my lord?
the night draws late.
once more I ask for your petition, my queen.
my petition, my lord, is that you allow me to finish a story.
one that I began many nights ago.
the story of Jacob, my lord, does not finish with marrying Rachel.
well, they go on to have 12 sons.
and like these 12 pillars that surround us, they became the pillars of a people.
surely...
surely you do not delay an army only to finish a children's tale?
if I still find favor in your sight, let my life be given me, at my petition.
and my people at my request.
you demand of me your life and that of your people?
my dear girl,
I know not of your people. You have yet to tell me who they are.
had we been merely sold as slaves, I would have held my tongue.
this Haman wanted our blood, my blood, the blood of Jacob, your Jacob.
your Jacob was given a new name.
israel.
as, too, was I.
you, Esther?
a Jew?
not Esther, my lord.
hadassah Bat-Abihail, daughter of the tribe of Benjamin, child of the most high God.
never have I heard a more pathetic story in my entire life.
she is no Jew.
she's another Vashti.
seems it not convenient to you?
an army marches, and suddenly she is a Jew.
Esther is a Jew.
your Vashti but protested the notion of war.
this queen seeks to counter the very authority of your rule.
a Jew? If such were true, why did she hide it till now?
pray, do tell us.
the Almighty has indeed ordained that my words speak not truth unto you. At least allow my heart.
for this which I have offered you, my most precious in all the world, the very identity etched within me.
well, is something supposed to be happening here?
the stars... Do you not see them?
do you not see them?
a mockery.
perhaps not how you had hoped it would end?
imagined you that I would beg?
think you I will beg?
beg for my life?
beg like my forefather Agag before your sword?
would you like me to beg for you?
Oh, please, my lady.
please, Your Highness.
please spare me.
spare me my life. You are a lady of mercy.
spare me.
I beg for forgiveness.
spare me, spare me, you Jew!
would he also assault the Queen, my wife, while I am in my house?
Harbonah has informed me that the gallows post stands in Haman's yard even as we speak. Apparently intended for one Mordecai the Jew.
hang him on it.
No!
No!
what made you come back?
I saw them.
I saw the stars.
MORDECAI.; Thus with one faithful act has a new generation redeemed the time of centuries past and stepped into their destiny.
on this day, I give you your new prince, and master of audiences,
mordecai Ben-Yair.
on the day appointed for their destruction, all Jews shall have the right to protect themselves and shall be entitled to take all the property of their attackers.
and I send forth this story enjoining all to keep a day of feasting and gladness.
a celebration to be passed on and retold through every generation, to be known as Purim, or the casting of the Pur that determined its time.
while we continue onward in the face of a world filled with uncertainty, we can rejoice, for hidden within its mysteries is the honor of a king.
thus dictated, I order this decree sent out under the great seal of Mordecai, prince of Persia, a Jew.
Peyton, 8th-grade cheer camp.
now it's hoes over psychos.
you saved me. - You saved me, too.
you want to come with me?
I'm coming with you.
do you think it's impossible for you to ever have feelings for me again?
it's not impossible.
you lost your phone.
that's not my phone.
what are you doing here, Lucas?
I keep feeling like Keith's trying to tell me something.
Keith's dead.
open your eyes.
william Blake once wrote, "There are things that are known "and "things that are unknown."
and in between there are doors. - Hey, yo, Luke.
damn. Nice work.
no. No, it's not...
it's the attack last week.
neither one of them wants to be alone.
Hey, if that's your story. Look, we got to go.
what? - It's Mouth. He needs our help.
you wanted to see me, Mr. Mayor?
Yeah. Come on in, Joe.
I need you to access this phone's calling history.
sure. Whose phone is it?
that's what I want you to find out.
with all due respect, Mr. Mayor, I can't do that.
that's illegal.
you got a performance review coming up, don't you, Joe?
not to mention a sexy little thing going on with -- what's her name?
Darcy in public relations?
but wait a minute.
your wife's name's Jill, isn't it?
it might take me a day or two.
works for me.
say hi to Darcy for me.
so, it's been what, about a week since Mouth skipped town with Rachel?
then, all of a sudden, I get this cryptic message.
sounds like he's in trouble.
okay, what kind of message? Like voice mail?
no, a text, actually. Check it out.
honey Grove, Texas. Please come. Need ass?
I was thinking he would've typed "assistance" but his battery died.
why didn't he just write "help"? "Need help"?
maybe he need ass.
Hey.
Hey, Skills said Mouth was in trouble.
Yeah, he sent this.
need "ass"?
we're thinking it's "assistance."
I'm gonna find Honey Grove online.
Hey, how are they doing since the attack?
some days are better than the others.
but it gets the worst at night.
Hey, you guys, what's going on? Is Mouth okay?
it doesn't sound like it.
honey Grove, Texas. Please come.
need "ass"?
I don't get it. He left with Rachel. Why would he need ass?
assistance. - Assistance.
well, if Mouth needs help, then one of us needs to go down to Honey Grove, Texas.
I think we should probably all go. It's about 90 miles from Dallas, which is like a 20-hour car ride.
hales, I love you for caring, but you're pregnant and we got finals.
we're all graduating soon. It could be a last hurrah.
hopefully, Mouth is okay and it turns into a great road trip.
but if not, there's safety in numbers, right?
okay, Karen and I made sandwiches, and I got chips and drinks, and we're all set.
I brought red vines.
you can't have a road trip without red vines.
I brought old yearbooks -- might give us a laugh.
what did you bring, Nate?
I brought Haley, who brought the food.
I brought my hot body and Rachel's Denali.
she might have left, but at least we have her car.
sure it's not stolen?
Oh, wait. That's just calculus exams.
my girl's not a big Rachel fan.
Peyton, what did you bring?
road mix.
okay, let's go.
you seem rather excited, considering Mouth might be in a lot of trouble.
well, I'm choosing to believe that he's fine.
besides, it's Mouth. How much trouble could he actually get into?
he's probably having fun.
have fun.
okay, Brooke, freshman year.
lance Bass? Really?
he was cute, okay?
I'm not sure I'd go there, Hales. Check this out.
Luke, stay cool forever! Haley.
so, what's wrong with that?
you think that's bad? Check this out.
Peyton wrote to me in my sophomore yearbook...
come on! I didn't even know you then.
you know how hard I worked to get my yearbook in front of her?
and then she signs her damn name.
I was crushed.
okay, how about this one?
Lucas, you know you want me! Taylor James.
I wonder what she wrote in Nathan's yearbook.
Hey, look. "Luke, you're a great friend."
thanks for looking out for me. See ya around.
who wrote that one?
Jimmy Edwards. Sorry.
how about we just try and let go of all the pain on this trip and only focus on the good things in our lives?
okay, who's with me?
ready for that. - Definitely.
okay, Luke?
Yeah, sure.
I don't know why you do it, Conrad.
we keep playing.
you keep losing.
um, hiya, fellas.
I'm Mouth.
listen, guys, I don't want any trouble. I mean,
I like girls, really. See?
um, if I could just get that back
or what?
listen, I know you could probably kill me right now
I mean... definitely kill me right now, but you're only three moves away from winning your chess match.
knight to G7. I'm sure you were just about to do that anyway...
sir.
guard.
checkmate.
no one touches the kid.
come on, man, it's your turn to drive.
we're each taking four-hour shifts.
it's your turn to drive, baby.
already?
four hours.
so, let me get this straight. You slept with Shelly.
the Clean Teen with the leather pants?
Yep.
my man!
but then you took Brooke to the prom
is Brooke the one with the clothing line?
but then you left town with Rachel and all of her fine plastic parts.
so, what happened, Mouth?
you guys ever had your heart broken?
what's going on up there?
I don't know.
how long has that light on the dash been on?
um, just a little while. It was kind of a pretty color, and I liked it.
bad call?
bad call.
I don't know.
it's all electronic. I can't figure it out.
but I do know we should have stuck to the interstate and not taken the back roads just so Haley could see the sandwich shaped like Elvis.
Hey! - Hold on a second.
I, too, wanted to see the sandwich shaped like Elvis. I'm pretty sure we all did.
thank you.
and, Lucas, admit it.
you wanted to see the Elvis sandwich, too, didn't you?
fine. I wanted to see the Elvis sandwich, okay?
but that still doesn't change the fact that we haven't seen a car pass by since we stopped.
until now.
it's a bus.
that's a tour bus.
please be the Foo Fighters.
please be Kanye.
well, well.
stupid Elvis sandwich.
let's see here. Slept with you...
kissed you... got slapped by you.
just like any other night on Chris Keller's tour bus.
so, they can tow the car to Honey Grove, but we're on our own.
we're rolling right through there.
you guys should just crash with me.
come on. It'll be like old times.
you know, without Nate trying to kill me for singing duets with Haley.
I'm down for all that. You got some gin in this joint?
full bar in back.
I'm loving Chris Keller.
look, I got plenty of room.
I'm going your way. Haley can sleep in my bed.
though you're looking a little plump, Hales.
what the hell? I've had bigger trunk in my bunk.
I'm pregnant, you idiot.
dude, totally not mine.
well, everything seems to be okay.
are you missing anything?
I don't think so.
I'm sorry.
it's just that Lucas wasn't here, and the door was open, and I just...
I'm so embarrassed that I called you.
no, no. Don't be. I would've been upset if you didn't call me.
now I'm gonna make you some tea.
I want you to relax and take it easy.
that stress isn't healthy for the baby.
so, what's up? You been good?
Yeah, I'm all right. Just dealing with some stuff.
like what?
nothing, really.
I can handle it.
same old Nathan Scott.
what about you?
what's your story?
Oh, you know, just driving blue highways, looking for that life you already got.
you know, for the luckiest guy I know, you worry too much.
and contrary to popular belief, most of life's problems don't get solved on a tour bus in the middle of Texas.
turn your mind off and relax.
well, this is it -- Honey Grove, the sweetest town in Texas.
get it? 'Cause of the honey part?
now we just got to find Mouth.
I guess I'd just ask a cop if I were you guys.
right, let's just walk up to the first cop we see and say, "hey, have you seen our friend Mouth?"
why not? It's a small town.
excuse me! - Keller.
top of the morning, officer friendly.
shut up. Excuse me, sir. We're looking for a friend of ours.
kind of goofy-looking kid, big lips, spiky hair?
needs ass.
damn. Our guy's name is Mouth.
Luke! Guys! Man, am I glad to see you.
mouth, what happened?
it's kind of a long story. Let's just get out of here.
let him go, Lemmy.
Oh, hi.
you spent the night? - Yeah.
Yeah. Just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I'm sorry. I must look like hell. I should go.
or I could make us some breakfast.
I'd like that.
I understand.
you have to do what you have to do.
everything okay?
Yeah. Just checking on my mom.
Hey, we found him.
Hey, Mouth! - Now I'm really emrrassed.
you guys didn't all have to come.
we wanted to, man. - Yeah, man, definitely.
who are you again?
I'm the idiot who got arrested for sleeping in the park.
wait. What?
you didn't tell us what happened. Where's Rachel?
uh, it's kind of a long story. She's just, um...
she's gone. - Damn it.
anyway, I tried texting you guys, but my phone died.
I just want to go home.
unfortunately the car won't be ready till tomorrow.
but there are rooms available at a motel.
sorry, guys. - No, don't be sorry.
we wanted to come. We're just glad you're okay.
besides, I'm sure we can find something fun to do in this town.
Yeah, right. What? Look at this place.
we'll go to prom.
prom?
Yeah, Honey Grove's prom is tonight. We should go.
come on, our prom sucked. Our car broke down.
Yeah, and we got attacked by a psycho.
what? - Long story.
we're just gonna crash the Honey Grove prom?
Yeah, why not?
okay, hold on. Where are we gonna get tuxes and dresses by tonight?
we go old-school.
check it out.
I see what I'm wearing tonight.
dude, not if I beat you to it. Come on!
it's good to see you and Peyton getting along.
Yeah.
you know, we've been staying together at Luke's every night since the attack.
it works out 'cause I'm basically homeless, now that Rachel's gone, anyway.
right. Speaking of that, I wanted to know if maybe you wanted to take the apartment back.
Nathan and I are gonna go stay with his mom, at least until the end of the school year.
and you still have all your old stuff in there.
what do you think? - Yes. I mean, definitely.
thank you. That's great. - Yeah, yeah. No problem.
I mean, also, besides, the sooner you cut your ties with that lying thief Rachel, the better, right?
Yeah.
can't believe I'm going stag.
dude, so what happened to you, anyway, with Rachel?
I just wanted Shelly back.
she was the girl I'd just started dating.
actually, we, uh, never really got started.
she blew you off, huh?
I just felt so...
not good enough, you know?
like I wasn't good enough to make her stay. I wasn't enough to amaze her.
I just wanted to amaze her.
bitches.
and then Rachel...
she made me feel special.
and there's such a power in that, especially with a girl who looks like Rachel.
and even though I kind of knew we were a lie, it was like a pain reliever.
I mean, the pain was still there, but...
I didn't feel it for a while.
so what happened?
well, we flew to New Orleans and we rented a car and we just started driving.
and Rachel was telling me how I was good enough, how I was dangerous.
and then one night, as this amazing sun was setting, she called me worthy.
okay. Oh, fine. Fine, Mouth, but tell me
what about the sex?
so we get to this hotel, and we're in the bar.
she kind of starts flirting with this guy.
and then she said something.
what did she say?
she told him he was worthy.
hearing her say it to someone else,
I knew that there would always be a someone else with her, 'cause that's who she is.
anyway, I went for a walk, and I ended up on the town square
you know, where you guys were today?
I started thinking about how much I was throwing away, how tanking my finals would crush my parents and how I'm not that guy.
I'm not dangerous.
I'm Marvin McFadden. I'm solid.
I'm dependable.
that's who I am.
tell me you at least slept with her.
you suck, man.
where is she?
I don't know. I called her and told her I was going home, and when I got back to the room, she was gone.
this picture of us was all she left behind.
I could've loved the boy in this picture.
I hate you, Mouth. You know that?
you sure you didn't sleep with her before your lame-ass epiphany?
no.
but I did see her naked.
you really suck, man. You know that?
anybody ever tell you that you're kind of pretty, Haley James Scott?
does Chris Keller count?
you know what's great about being a married couple going to a prom?
what?
you get to use the hotel room before the dance.
penny for your thoughts?
I'm not sure they're worth that much.
just thinking about Chase.
I'm really sorry, Brooke.
you miss him?
Yeah, I do.
Plus, I'm not really a fan of being alone these days.
Oh, well, I was thinking maybe you could move in with me.
I can't. I'm moving back into the apartment.
okay, cool.
I just -- yeah.
but maybe you could move in, too?
you mean that?
Yeah.
look...
I know I said we could never be friends like before.
but...
maybe we can be better.
you look beautiful.
Hey, Skills, you know this girl?
Yeah.
that's Abby.
she was in the tutor center.
you know.
you know, it just never made no sense to me.
what's that?
Jimmy. See, Abby had diabetes, so he let her go.
look, I know Jimmy was all distraught and not himself, but...
I could never understand how he could just have it in his heart to let Abby go, but with Keith, that was somebody he knew and loved.
Lucas Scott, will you go to prom with me?
Absolutely.
nice outfits.
you guys crashing?
who, us? No.
honey Grove's a small town.
we know everybody in our school.
okay, look. Here's the deal.
we got stranded here, and our prom really sucked, so we figured maybe we could come to yours.
you won't tell anyone, will you?
no, it's cool.
you guys have fun.
anybody want to dance?
so nobody has a fatal heart condition and a father who was purposely set on fire?
you probably have classmates who are married, right?
wife's pregnant? Got married as juniors?
I started the clothing line after Peyton and I shoplifted my designs back and got arrested.
arrested? What did your parents say?
Oh, I haven't seen my parents in like a year.
I live with my friend Rachel. She's so funny.
she's had all this plastic surgery, and she just got suspended, and...
now she's kind of missing.
you ever had your heart broken?
Yeah, I think that happens everywhere.
you know, I really appreciate the way you've been lately since my pregnancy.
But?
well, you can't blame me for being cautious.
17 years of misery is a long time.
why now?
I was lying to myself, Karen.
I was also married.
I'm single now, for the first time since I was 17, and truly in love.
you're still in my heart, Karen.
that's why now.
what?
we've just been through so much.
you've been through so much.
sometimes I wonder how you put up with me.
I gave you my heart.
when you fall short -- when we fall short...
I know we're gonna be okay.
you're my forever. You're my always.
God, the way you look at me sometimes.
thanks for being so good to me this week, Luke...
and to Brooke.
it means everything.
I'd do anything for you.
uh, could you get a room?
do you want to?
I'd avoid the punch. It's more vodka than punch.
great. Thank you for the tip.
you having fun, tutor girl? - Yeah, I am.
although I think you mean ex-tutor girl, thanks to that hag Rachel.
Haley, it was me.
what was?
I stole the test. I cheated.
Rachel just took the fall for me.
are you kidding me?
Brooke, I got fired for that. Not to mention the fact that I trusted you and you lied to my face.
I know, and I'm sorry. It's just...
I wasn't gonna graduate, and then she told me I'd lose my clothing contract, - and I panicked and - Unbelievable.
Haley, wait. Don't go. I feel terrible.
I'm sure you do.
you know what?
that tape with you and Nathan really hurt me, but I decided to let it go because that was a Brooke I didn't know.
this is worse.
my friend did this.
you girls want to dance?
no, thanks.
wait. You're Chris Keller, right?
that's right.
how old are you?
I had a great evening, Karen.
Thanks. I can see myself out.
well, maybe we could do this again.
soon.
sure.
but just friends, right?
we'll see.
you've got protection, right?
have you met my father?
of course you do. Sorry.
I'm really glad we waited.
last year would have been just sex, and now I...
I am so in love with you.
I love you, too, Peyton.
so, Davis, you have fun tonight?
Oh, I have a good time.
you seem a little drunk.
I said I have a good time.
after-hours in my room? - Yeah.
damn, I got to stop doing this.
Oh, god. I'm so sorry, really.
that was uncomfortable.
you know what, guys?
I think I'm gonna take a walk.
you sure? You been drinking.
trust me, I'm sober now.
how's my girl feeling?
okay.
is your leg bothering you?
no, my leg is not bothering me.
it's Brooke that's bothering me.
I'm trying to let it all go and just be here with you, but...
anything I can help with?
no. Not really.
tell me a secret.
risky.
okay.
for the past few months, I've been pretty freaked out about being a dad.
but lately, I, uh, I know it's gonna be okay.
it's gonna be great, actually.
you are so sexy when you talk like that.
I'm so glad we made this trip.
I'm always gonna remember this.
honey Grove? - No.
how much I love you right now.
well, well.
took you long enough.
don't flatter yourself.
want to come inside?
I get really good-looking after a few drinks.
Oh, but I've already had a few drinks.
and how do I look?
as good as the last time I got you wasted?
listen.
my last couple relationships have been screwed up big-time.
and I also have a terrible fear of being alone.
so if we slept together, it would just mean that I'm drunk and trying to kill the pain.
it wouldn't have anything to do with you.
works for me.
no.
no.
I got to stop all that.
I'm graduating soon.
and god forbid I end up like you.
so you just want to talk?
you just want to talk?
sure.
Chris Keller gets lonely, too, sometimes.
I heard that.
tell me something.
I can't believe you guys came all this way to get me.
you're our boy, dog.
you know how I've been complaining about being everyone's friend?
no more.
I'm lucky to be that guy.
and I have a lot of great things because of it and a lot of great friends because of it.
see, there you go.
I call this a good road trip.
Yeah.
so, graduation soon, huh?
it's a little intimidating. I mean,
I only spent a few days in the real world, and I got to say, it was kind of scary.
you'll be a'ight, dog.
I mean, we all gonna be.
and if you ain't, your good friends gonna get you through it, right?
Yeah.
my dog.
Hey, you.
you okay?
Wow. You look beautiful.
you seem sad.
no. I'm not.
it's just...
I really love you, Lucas.
and it's a big deal.
I love you, too, Peyton.
I promise.
I need to go see Brooke.
it's our first night apart since the attack.
Hey.
I'm sorry about last night.
it's okay.
life's too short, you know?
so, does the roommate offer still stand?
Yeah.
if we're gonna live together, we need to come up with a system, 'cause I don't want to see that again.
Yeah.
did someone say threesome?
cause I'm a little sore, but I could be real up for that.
sore from what?
staying up all night, talking about your feelings and crying?
you said you weren't gonna tell.
Haley, can I talk to you?
I'm gonna tell Turner the truth.
don't.
so I lost my job at the tutoring center.
it's not as important as you not graduating or losing your clothing contract.
thank you, but none of that is as important to me as us.
I mean, maybe my clothing contract but...
no, seriously, none of it.
I'm just so sorry that I didn't tell you, Haley.
can you forgive me?
you are on notice, Brooke Davis.
clean up your act and be the girl I love.
well, Chris Keller's work here is done.
okay.
I'm leaving.
okay.
I think I'm gonna miss Honey Grove.
Yeah. Me too.
so, what do you want to hear, Sawyer?
I'm feeling the road mix.
Hey.
I need to talk to you.
Yeah. What's up?
I've been getting calls from this federal investigator.
he's asking questions about point-shaving, Luke.
Yeah, but we won the state championship.
not state. Semifinals.
what are you gonna do?
they're not asking about me, Luke.
they're asking about you.
Mr. Mayor, the phone was prepaid.
the only calls were made to you.
after the school shooting, we fingerprinted all the students.
I found a match.
william blake once wrote, "There are thing that are known "and "things that are unknown."
sometimes, it feels like it was yesterday
graduating high school, saying goodbye.
that feeling that you get at 17 or 18 that nobody in the history of the world has ever been this close, has ever loved this fiercely or laughed as hard or cared as much.
okay.
we're not gonna do this.
we're not gonna get sad. Nothing's gonna change now.
we'll all be friends forever.
I know it.
look, in four years, we're gonna be right back here.
you know, done with college or wherever we go. Right?
Yeah.
sometimes, it feels like it was yesterday.
and sometimes, it feels like someone else's memory.
where did he get the hoop?
his uncle lucas gave it to him.
I don't want him playing.
Nathan, he's 4 years old. All he wants to do is be like his dad.
why don't you go out there and show him
I said I don't want him playing.
Jamie, come on, sweetie. Mama's got to go to work.
good morning, clothes over bro'S. Please hold.
good morning, clothes over bro'S. Please hold.
can you call prime and make a dinner reservation, please?
make sure I get the table in the wine room.
any night next week will do.
um, you're booked every night next week.
okay, then the week after.
this looks great. Can we make this about a quarter-inch wider?
great.
and we've got to send something funny with a card to conan o'brien.
cheese. He likes cheese.
you want me to send conan o'brien cheese?
manchego.
no, send gouda.
Gouda's a funnier cheese, and don't forget to remind me about the conference call with macy'S.
guys.
absolutely not.
there is no way she gets on the cover of my magazine unless she gains 10 pounds, minimum.
she looks unhealthy.
we were just brainstorming.
brainstorm better.
anorexia is a disease.
it is not a fashion statement.
what do I smell?
um, it's your coffee.
mocha double latte, extra foam.
is there foam? Last time there was no foam. I like foam.
extra foam.
okay. What time is the premiere?
8: 00, red carpet at 6: 00.
I'm gonna do the red carpet and then skip the movie.
let's call one of the nicks and find out if they'd like to go.
okay, which knick do you prefer?
there's stephon marbury, jamal crawford...
Oh, david lee is really cute.
not the new york knicks, you goof.
the nicks -- nick lachey, nick zano, nick reid. Whoever.
and tell victoria to wait for me in the limo.
she's not gonna like that.
well, she works for me.
Oh, I must have the wrong office.
no, that's me -- john knight, label president.
last I knew, you were peyton sawyer, assistant to the assistant of the label president, and your desk was -- where is your desk?
I'm sorry, I was just arranging your trades and delivering the online download report, updating your call sheet, and admiring your view.
also, mr. Knight, I have a couple unsigned bands that I would really love for you to hear.
Peyton, I'm losing my hair, I'm hung over,
I have two different alimony payments due and seven lines ringing.
of course.
Yes.
you look good.
drop a button on that top and I'll let you sit in on the morning new-music session.
one button, one song.
and get me some aspirin.
man, they do grow up fast.
uncle lucas!
Hey. You in high school already?
no, I'm only 4.
hmm, 4 going on 40.
what you drawing?
you can't see it.
it's not done.
Yeah, trust me, I understand that one.
I take it the writing's not going very well?
the writing...
is not going at all.
how about you?
how was the last day of student teaching?
great. Trying not to freak out about next week when it's just me.
you're gonna be great, hales.
did you get a nanny yet?
no, not yet.
well, you know, you can't babysit him forever, hales.
and by him, I mean nathan, not jamie.
well, it's only been four months, so...
Seattle is on the clock right now.
we'll get to the commissioner coming up in regards to their pick.
they going big?
they going small?
it's been unpredictable so far.
here's the commissioner.
with the 10th pick in the nba draft, the seattle sonics select...
we're moving to seattle, mama!
it's gonna be seattle.
my agent just called. He said we got a guarantee
I'm going 10th pick to the sonics!
Oh, baby, I'm so proud of you!
you have worked so hard for the last four years!
you believed in it, and now it's actually happening!
why are we buying a house in tree hill if we're moving to seattle?
we should buy a house there.
Oh, we're going to.
a big one.
with a pool?
more like a moat and a drawbridge.
and a dragon?
Yes, and a pet dragon for jim-jam.
hales, we're gonna have all kinds of houses, but tree hill is home.
and, besides, this isn't even my salary.
this is just shoe-contract money.
it's money from the shoe, mama! Let's get it!
Oh, baby, I don't know.
the little man's spoken.
and he's right.
we should get the house, hales. You know why? - why?
because we did it together. We made it happen.
and we're gonna have to get used to the fact that this is what life's like when your dreams come true.
the tar heels land another blue chip prospect, and we've got the scoop.
I'm marvin mcfadden -- - Pass it, pass it, pass it! Pass the ball!
Yeah, he is. He's passing it to my guy.
can you guys keep it down?
I'm working on my demo.
for what? - A job.
I'm gonna send audition tapes to all the local stations.
sorry, mouth. Go ahead, man, do your thing.
the tar heels land another blue chip prospect, and we've got the scoop.
I'm marvin mcfadden -- - no, no, no, no, no, no!
that's how you go down the lane!
sorry. - Sorry.
the tar heels land another blue chip prospect, and we've got the scoop.
pizza!
I'll pause it.
junk and fergie play video games, drink beer, and eat pizza.
I'm mouth mcfadden, and I'm still unemployed.
so, six months ago when they asked us to fix this mess, what the hell were we thinking saying yes?
well, well, well, if it isn't skills taylor, new assistant head coach of the tree hill raiders.
Hey, if you could afford me...
so, how great is this, huh?
Lucas scott, head coach.
local boy makes good.
local boys made good.
you're a big part of this, skills.
I hope so.
man, we blew this place up.
Hey, how many games they won since we hung that state championship banner?
not many.
but I do know one thing -- losing's over.
Oh, no doubt.
she's got a hit tv show.
great potential for crossover marketing and promo.
but the songs are terrible.
John, she's young, she's hot, and her social life's a train wreck.
we could ship this thing platinum.
um, I have a band.
well, why not?
it can't get any worse.
okay, well, they're called low versus diamond, and they've already built a strong internet following, and the songs are great.
we'll go with the actress.
all right?
why don't you go get us some lunch menus?
ladies and gentlemen, the N. S.23
let's see it.
Barry, thank you so much.
baby, it's awesome.
I have to go relieve the sitter.
but you guys should stay and celebrate.
it's the night before the draft.
you sure? - Yeah.
thank you guys!
Hey, no driving tonight, okay?
take the limo and get the car tomorrow.
I promise. - Okay.
hook it up. - Check it out.
and like the river court signatures "of their younger selves, weathered now, faded.
so, too, were they.
I...suck.
tell me you are writing the best pages of your life.
well, hi to you, too.
if not the best pages of your life, at least a bunch of okay pages?
I've written a few sentences.
and deleted them because they sucked.
Luke, this is serious.
I can't be your editor if I don't have anything to edit.
my butt is on the line here.
tell me you have something, anything.
Uhh...lindsey?
I don't know. You know, I think it's an earthquake.
somebody needs to do something about the paparazzi.
they're totally out of control.
we pay them a lot of money to talk about the brand.
I hope you were nice.
I was nice.
Nick, did you enjoy yourself?
I did. I thought the movie was
driver, can you pull over, please?
I'm sorry, darling. You were saying?
nothing. I liked the movie.
thank you very much, and enjoy the rest of your evening.
right.
okay.
I just -- I just thought that maybe...
Yes, we know what you thought, nick.
you thought you'd have your way with my designer.
a little fondling, a little tongue-kissing, something a little dirty but not too freaky.
uh, no, I just thought that
it's clothes over bro's, nick.
we want the tabloids to think that she's sleeping with you.
she's not actually sleeping with you.
we're all set.
call me!
Taxi!
you are unbelievably rude.
well, it's been a long day.
but tomorrow's even longer.
you have a 9: 00 A. M.Interview about taking the company public.
I'll be there for the finer points.
you just need to look beautiful and talk about your passion and your creativity and blah, blah, blah.
and I've made a change to the model lineup due to the additional scrutiny from the press.
Oh, but you forgot -- - she's not on the list.
she's my friend.
she's not your friend.
she's an employee.
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.
Brooke, clothes over bro's is a multimillion dollar company.
Yeah.
a company that you've entrusted to me to make executive decisions like these.
we have to cut her loose.
you're gonna fire her?
no, I'm not gonna fire her.
you're gonna fire her.
it's your company, my dear.
I just work here.
Hey, it's me.
it's not gonna work out for the fashion show.
no, it's actually not gonna work out at all.
I'm gonna have to let you go.
it's nothing personal. It's just business.
I got to go.
one? - Yeah, man.
where are they now?
well, aunt karen and cousin lily are in ireland.
now, that's right across the irish sea from england.
you remember where england is?
the one with the clock!
you are a genius.
are you sure you're not my kid?
all right.
you think we'll ever see them again?
Oh, yeah, of course we will, man.
so, listen.
I'm gonna go talk to your dad, and then we'll go, okay? - Okay.
all right.
Haley keeps the alcohol out of reach.
at least, she tries.
it's a little early, don't you think?
so, how's physical therapy going?
how's your second book coming?
so, you know, haley told me that the doctors say you'll be up on your feet any day now.
pretty lucky, nate.
Oh, yeah, that's me.
Mr. Lucky.
I'm just saying you'll be back to normal in no time.
Luke, I'm never gonna play basketball again.
that's not exactly normal, okay?
Luke, damn it!
don't be a dick, all right?
you want it?
walk over here and get it.
why don't I walk over there and kick your ass, huh?
kicking. Kicking's good. Let's see it.
give me that bottle right now, or dan's not gonna be the only scott to kill his brother.
ready, uncle lucas?
real nice, nate.
come on, jamie. Let's go.
Bye, daddy.
Bye-bye.
so, none of you guys know who ate my pizza?
Nah, man.
amazing.
so, my pizza just ate itself.
Hey, I was working on my audition reel.
Hey, that's good.
cause you owe me for the rent.
and you two knuckleheads owe me for a pizza.
there he is!
big game james.
Hey, yo, big game.
I got something for you.
cool!
you want to try it on?
all right.
put your arms through, and there we go.
it's perfect!
let's see what you got, baller.
darn it, uncle skills, you always do that.
you ever gonna let him score?
shorty shouldn't be in the paint.
he got to learn.
dude, he's 4.
what do you think, sawyer?
I think you were right about the act we signed today.
her songs blow.
so why'd you sign her?
how long have you been in los angeles, peyton?
from...
from tree hill, north carolina.
four years.
four years.
why'd you come?
I wanted to discover and sign bands that could change someone's life, like the bands that changed mine.
I figured you were one of them.
I used to be, too.
then I figured it out.
it's called show business for a reason.
we're here to make money.
even if the product sucks.
especially if the product sucks.
I hate to be the one to break it to you, but rock 'n' roll can't actually save the world.
see, I disagree.
walk into any club on the strip tonight and just look at the kids, look into their eyes.
they're all looking for something to believe in.
I think that music can be the thing that changes their world.
that is why you are still the assistant to the assistant.
they're not out there to get their world saved.
they had a bad day.
they went out to get drunk and get laid.
Peyton, you're as smart and as talented as anyone at the label, but you'd be so much further along if you could just accept the business side of what we do and play the game.
I'm just not really interested in playing the game.
you already did.
you dropped a button to get into that meeting.
drop a few more, they'll probably give you my job.
well, I will have your job one day, john.
just not that way.
have fun in the clubs tonight, assistant to the assistant.
substitution for the clippers. J. Luke.
down by 2, and it looks like they're bringing in a rookie.
clock running down, time for one last play.
all right, jamie, this is what we're gonna do.
when I tell you, I want you to hit the green button. Okay?
don't do it, jamie.
pass it to your pal junk.
kid's got the ball clock running down.
Jamie, I'll give you ice cream. - ready - No, no, no, no, no! - Shot it!
Hi, upside-down boy.
Hey, mama! We won!
we were just...
here you go.
what are you wearing?
uncle skills gave it to me.
well, wasn't that nice of him, making you look all krunk.
did you say thank you?
okay, go say goodbye to the guys.
so, look, I kind of gave nathan some grief today about not being on his feet yet.
Oh, well, you know, I know he's a little dark right now.
you got to push him, hales.
okay, mom, I'm ready. - Okay.
whoa, what about me, jamie?
Bye, uncle lucas.
Oh, bye, buddy. I love you.
I got to go home now, and anyway, you should be writing.
I don't hent to ar it.
so, we caught up with young, hot designer of clothes over bro'S.
now, brooke, let me ask you this.
do you ever miss just being young?
I am young.
but acting young.
not being the boss of this huge corporation, but being brooke davis, 21-year-old girl?
sure, I miss it.
thank you. We have to move on.
clothes over bro's dr my eam come true.
this is what I wished for.
Oh, baby...
why don't you go upstairs? I'll be up in a minute, okay?
I can'T.
we can't be like this, nathan.
your son needs you.
please don't become your father.
Nathan: My father is in prison.
so am I.
well, you can walk out.
chapter three.
Peyton sawyer is destined for greatness.
actually, she's already great, because peyton sawyer has a thing called integrity, and nothing or no one is ever going to change that.
I remember the first time I met her.
you have 47 messages.
all messages deleted.
Hi. It's peyton.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I know it's late there, I just
what happened to us, you know?
I don't know who I am anymore.
or how I got here.
I miss who I used to be.
I want to have a home again, you know?
and real friends.
you know, the kind of friendships we used to believe in.
I miss that.
and I miss you.
I guess I just miss all of it.
no, I have the uncorrected proofs. I need the corrected ones.
okay, I have to go. Thanks. Bye.
look, before you start yelling at me, I'm sorry.
I know I've missed my deadline again, and I know you have a lot of people to answer to, and it's not fair to you.
I remember the first time I read it.
I was a junior editor, just out of college, missing my friends.
I took two dozen manuscripts home for the weekend, just like I did every weekend, hoping that this time, something would speak to me.
and it did.
it was a great first novel, luke.
it brought you to me.
but a writer's career is about a body of work.
it's about the second book and the third and the fourth.
Lindsey - - it's been two years.
and that wouldn't scare me if I thought you were writing, but you're not.
so what am I supposed to do, luke?
well, you could give me a little bit more time because I'm handsome.
close the door, luke.
not being the boss of this huge corporation but being brooke davis, 21-year-old girl.
that is not the face of a happy girl who got everything she wished for.
a lot of things, but not everything.
well, are you counting the trip to milan?
the trip for work. - Come on.
let's see the face of a girl who gets to go to italy tomorrow to approve the textiles for her fall line.
but it's not everything.
no, dear. It is everything.
and if you've lost sight of that, you have lost your way, brooke davis.
milan, tomorrow.
smile.
okay. Let's do lunch. Sawyer!
what's the name of that sushi place I like?
you were wrong yesterday when you said the kids in the clubs were just there for decadence.
I think it's more like romance and hope and inspiration and that feeling that you get when other human beings pick up basic instruments and make sense of your world.
and the day that I think it's just about making money is gonna be the day that
I've betrayed everything I believe in about music and life and myself.
was that a sushi place?
I quit, john. I'm going home.
you're making a mistake.
no. I'm fixing one.
I think you drink too much.
I think you're right.
Jamie, come on.
Hey, come on.
okay, your boarding pass and itinerary are in your bag.
the car service will pick you up in milan.
if you have any problems, I gave youand parents' house number.
Millicent, you are a great assistant, okay?
try and have some fun while I'm gone.
you're only young once.
Seattle is on the court right now.
are they going big? They going small?
they've been unpredictable so far. Here's the commissioner.
with the 10th pick in the nba draft, the seattle sonics select
hey - Hey, man.
uh, can I get an autograph? - Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Yeah, just write, uh,"to greg, portland's biggest fan.
Seattle sucks, and so do I.
to greg...
enjoy losing to us next year.
your pal, nathan scott.
there you go, buddy.
you got a problem, man?
no, no, no. Walk away.
you've got too much to lose here.
come on, man. Let's see what you got!
you got too much to lose here, okay?
it's not worth it. - That's it.
listen to your girlfriend.
come on, nate. Wait.
look, we shouldn't be driving, all right? I'll get the limo.
come on, nate.
we'll just grab barry, take the limo.
you're not driving.
all right. You're right.
Greg: I have witnesses. You all saw it.
he hit me. I'm gonna sue that punk.
Hey, man, I never touched you.
and if I'd have hit you, you'd be out cold right now.
too late, seattle boy.
you should have left with that fat-ass wife.
Oh, my god. Nate. Nate, you all right?
I can't feel my legs, man. - What?
I can't feel my legs!
help! Somebody help!
the seattle sonics select mouhamed sene from senegal.
okay, it's time for bed. Come on.
mama, why is daddy so sad?
um, it's just a really tough time for daddy right now.
but, uh -- but he loves you.
you know that, right?
uncle lucas loves me.
Lohow ng's it been?
two years.
it's been longer than that.
God, luke, I missed you.
I have someone.
I'm with someone.
postseason hardball, preseason hoops, and regular season football.
I'm marvin mcfadden, and sports is coming up next.
an unkindness of ravens hi. It's peyton.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I know it's late there, I just
what happened to us, you know?
I don't know who I am anymore.
or how I got here.
Hey, you.
come to bed.
sorry about yesterday.
it's just, they only agreed to let me split time here because I promised them I'd get you back on track.
I know. It's okay.
I still love you.
I love you, too, lucas scott.
I miss who I used to be.
I want to have a home again, you know?
I miss that.
I miss you.
son...
daddy's sorry, for everything.
come here.
I guess I miss all of it.
does any of that make any sense?
makes all the sense in the world, peyton.
four years ago, it all seemed so clear, didn't it?
conquer the world, save the world, live happily ever after.
are you happy, brooke?
sometimes.
not always. Are you?
no.
okay. Then let me ask you something.
what is gonna make you happy, peyton?
is it how you look or the car you drive or the people you know?
is it money or celebrity or power or accomplishment?
because I have all those things, and -- and I don't think it's enough.
well, then, what is?
love, I think.
and that love can bor aoy or a girl or a place or a way of life or even for a family.
but where you find it is up to you.
so where are you gonna find that love, peyton?
I think I need to go home.
I was hoping you'd say that.
I missed you, brooke davis.
I missed you, peyton sawyer.
we're home now.
it's gonna be okay.
come on.
my name is Lucas Scott.
four years ago, I graduated from high school with my friends.
Brooke Davis moved to New York city and found success...
Peyton Sawyer to Los Angeles.
I wrote a novel and fell for my editor, Lindsey.
recently, we've come home.
I missed you, P.Sawyer.
now Brooke's opening a local bout hue forer fashion l Peyton Sawyer is starting her own record label.
my best friend Haley started teaching...
Quentin: That is some fine ass.
who said that?
but it hasn't been easy.
Hey, man.
nor has it been easy for her husband, Nathan, who in a moment of anger, watched his dreams of playing professional basketball vanish.
you have a beautiful son who is here!
I am here!
one more night like this, Nathan, and I promise you, you will have nothing!
a lot has changed since high school...
I still love you.
I love you, too, lucas scott.
but in many ways, our journey is just beginning.
did you write all night?
Yeah.
I guess I did.
the question is, how much of it survived the dreaded "delete" button?
almost all of it.
you must be ready to pass out.
actually, I'm not tired.
I'm really energized.
the words came to me.
I haven't felt this inspired since my last book.
I'm glad.
and it's a good thing you're energized.
because you have practice in like eight minutes.
off you go, coach.
that was just mean.
you're a mean person.
you know that, yeah.
Haley, come look at this. Haley!
sorry, Haley's not here. She's at school.
um, I'm Carrie, the new
the new nanny. I know. She told me.
okay, well, I'm gonna make breakfast.
do you want me to bring you some?
no. I'm good. Thanks.
guess where I am?
you're feeling warm and fuzzy in your new office, while I'm stuck in incompetent construction worker hell?
I mean, it's like they're in slow motion.
complain all you want, but I think you're having fun. Admit it.
well, I'll admit that I'm enjoying doing something on my own...
on my own for once.
I can't wait to see Victoria's face when she sees
speak of the devil. She's on the other line.
of course.
well, good thing you're already in hell.
call me later. - Okay.
I was just about to call you.
no, you weren't.
why haven't I received your flight itinerary?
because I've decided to stay in Tree Hill a few extra days.
we're opening a new store.
I didn't approve a Tree Hill location.
that doesn't even make sense.
Brooke Davis, you are jeopardizing this company.
you're the face of the brand, and your absence can cause irreparable harm.
now, what the hell has gotten into you?
home.
are you doing drugs?
because if you are, it's okay.
I can spin this in a good way.
I have to go.
excuse me.
um, we're gonna keep this.
this belongs here.
somebody told me that this is the place where everything's better and everything's safe
did you just walk down the stairs?
if by "walking," you mean "falling."
you didn't have to come down.
I told you I'd bring you some breakfast.
s what is that?
bacon and eggs.
Yes, it's rearranged into a smiley face.
I do that sometimes.
I'm an optimist.
whatever.
um, listen, I need you to give me a ride somewhere.
do nannies do that?
sure.
I don't have to pick up Jamie for a few hours.
just... let me get your crutches.
and no more falling.
skills: Hey, pick it up, blue! Let's go!
Hey, coach, you got a sec?
that depends -- are you gonna be one of those teachers constantly complaining about my players' grades?
if your players are failing, you bet your ass I will.
Oh, fair enough.
grades are the least of this team's worries.
Oh, my god!
can't be serious.
how's Quentin? Is he still disrupting your class?
actually, no.
Quentin has not been in class all week, and I think it's because he got kicked off the team.
you can't save 'em all, Hales.
God!
I think your team looks really good.
the J. V. is the team in white.
in the blue -- yeah, those are mine.
we're a work in progress.
awkward.
I'm gonna go to class now. I'll see you later.
Haley, how's my little brother doing?
he's a work in progress.
finish!
excuse me.
I, uh, I found my demo in the trash.
perhaps you should have left it there.
I don't think so.
excuse me?
what did you just say?
look, maybe I'm not right for the job, okay?
but my audition demo doesn't belong in the trash.
I worked really hard on it.
you're right.
that was a mistake...
and I'm sorry.
I meant to put it in the recycling bin.
yo, Mouth! It's early lunch Thursday!
friends at work -- half a strike at least.
Thanks. Nice timing, by the way.
Hello, Nate.
it's good to see you, Nathan.
been a long time.
4 years.
4 years, 15 weeks, 2 days.
counting the days is kind of a popular hobby around here -- that and ceramics.
tell me about the accident.
it was a moment of anger.
I had a chance to walk away, and I didn't do it.
and now my punishment is...
I get to regret it every day for the rest of my life.
join the club.
my biggest regret's not being able to watch my grandson grow up, losing my family -- those are things you still have.
how is my grandson?
he must be getting big by now.
you got a picture of him?
I'm not here to talk about Jamie.
I understand.
I just always wondered if he knows who I am.
he found a picture of you once.
we told him that you were his grandfather.
he asked where you were.
What'd you tell him?
we told him you were dead.
can I help you with something?
sorry.
uh, no, I just thought I would lounge here while I'm on my break.
well, you know, they do have a teacher's lounge for that, right?
Oh, Luke, it's so creepy in there.
they're all acting like they're still my teachers.
I feel like I'm being graded.
you too, huh? - Yeah.
so, I hear you rented out your office space at Tric to Peyton.
Lindsey okay with that?
Yeah, why not?
I don't know.
maybe because Peyton's not just another ex-girlfriend and everybody knows that.
Haley, I'm just helping out an old friend, okay? That's all.
besides, you know, Lindsey's not really the jealous type.
good answer, because I'm having lunch with her in a few minutes.
so, this was just a sneak attack?
you're just gathering information?
Yeah, pretty much.
how did I not see this coming?
because you're a guy, Luke, and guys are...
so predictable.
skills: Girls are so predictable.
she's not a girl -- she's a woman.
she is a cougar.
well, whatever she is, she hates me, and it's getting worse every day.
that's called "sexual tension," dog.
you need to stay off the internet.
no, I'm serious.
look, last year, I had this professor, right?
she kept on riding me all semester, dog, I mean, and not in a good way.
but one day, she started bitching at me after class.
I planted one on her.
you did not.
there's no way you did that.
that's not all I did.
I'm telling you, hook it up.
you have finally lost touch with reality.
Oh, and by the way, next time you decide to stop by my work, try not to yell out "early lunch Thursday!"
okay.
I'm telling you, I think you're gonna miss out on some hot cougar love.
Oh, thank you.
said you wanted to get to know me better, but I knew right away, you were sizing me up.
Oh, I was not.
Haley, you asked me to bring a photocopy of my driver's license.
well, I was just, you know, checking to make sure you were good enough for my best friend.
I mean, Lucas had been through a lot lately, you know?
Lucas tell you he wrote all night?
no, I thought he's been blocked.
guess he got inspired.
Oh, that's good.
isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, as his editor, I'm thrilled, obviously, but as his girlfriend, I can't help but notice the timing.
Oh, you're talking about Peyton coming back?
I sound like a jealous girlfriend.
no, you don't.
thank you.
look, I know Lucas better than anyone does.
I'm telling you, he's very much in love with you.
Thanks, Haley.
okay, now I need you to tell me that I'm not totally insane for hiring a hot nanny.
I'm pretty sure you have more toys than any other kid on the planet.
you can play with them. I don't mind.
Thanks.
daddy doesn't like it when I play basketball.
why not?
can you keep a secret?
I'm the best at keeping secrets.
okay, but no telling.
okay.
it's good to see everybody working on their dunks, considering most of you can't even make a free throw.
you guys lost 8 games last year by 3 points or less -- 8.
now, does anyone know how many games you won by 3 points or less?
I do. Zero.
Oh, that's right -- none.
now, maybe, if you guys could've hit a few free throws, maybe you could've made the playoffs.
so, this is how we're gonna start -- fundamentals.
see this spot?
we're gonna start practice every day from this line right here.
and any player who can't step up and knock down three straight free throws in a row is gonna run all day.
who wants to prove me wrong?
go ahead and start running, superstar.
Hey, and don't be high-fiving nobody, either.
who's next?
you're late.
it's 1: 00.
no, it was 1: 00 30 seconds ago, which makes you late -- another strike.
why do you hate me so much?
Why?
you know, we gave you a fantastic opportunity here, but it's so obvious to me that you think you are above the work.
you don't want to pay your dues.
you come in late.
you pass around your worthless audition demo.
somehow, I'm a bitch because I've decided that you haven't earned it yet.
you know what?
why don't you just face the reality of the situation?
you are wasting your time here.
you are irrelevant.
you are annoying
and now you're fired.
I know it wasn't easy for you, coming here.
it means a lot to me.
I didn't come here for you.
you know, as long as I can remember, you taught me that basketball was the most important thing in the world.
so when I lost it, I thought my life was over.
Yeah, and those tools ended up preventing me from succeeding.
don't ever back down.
second place is the first loser.
do you remember that?
don't expect me to apologize for teaching you to play a game that you love, that you chose.
a game that nearly destroyed my family.
it's not worth it, and my family's all I have now.
that's why I'll never let my son play.
basketball's taken enough.
you're not on those crutches 'cause I handed you a basketball when you were 3.
and trust me -- you not letting your son play is just as bad as you making him play.
and that's why you're here -- to blame me for what happened to you.
no.
I've been sitting at home for four months blaming you, and now I'm done.
it's time to move on.
I'm letting go of the anger, and I'm letting go of you.
I just had to look you in the eye when I told you that.
I won't be back.
don't you see, Nathan?
the strength you need to let go of it, to leave your old man behind
that's what I taught you.
lesson learned.
I love you, son.
this is officially the coolest office I've ever been in.
uh, yeah.
now I just need to sign a couple bands and prove to myself it wasn't all a big mistake.
from what I've heard about you, I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
well, I hope you're right.
Oh, uh, this is for you.
it's supposed to bring good luck.
it's a lucky bamboo.
they don't need much sunlight.
just make sure you water it every day.
I will. Thank you.
well, I hope it all works out.
I know we just met, but I just wanted you to know that I'm here.
good to know.
Bye, Peyton.
are you telling me not one of them made their free throws?
let's just put it this way -- we could have built a new gym with all them bricks.
you know they're counting on us to turn this thing around, right, this season?
they'll get better. - Yeah?
well, if they don't, maybe we can start a track team.
come on! Keep going!
run, run, run! Pick it up!
Hey, how'd you get home?
took a cab.
you took an hour-long cab ride?
that must have cost a fortune.
I would have picked you up.
no, don't worry about it.
I get the handicap discount.
you'd think, in this town, they'd have a state championship discount.
I went to Pontiac.
you beat us in the championship game.
I cried for a week.
sorry.
so, how does it feel to be a hometown hero?
I'm not that guy anymore, all right?
trust me -- I'm nobody's hero.
you sure about that?
looks like you're somebody's hero.
I promised my mom I'd send her a photo once you got finished destroying her caf?
okay, that's not fair. I hated doing it.
but I kept the sign.
well, I'll make sure I mention it in my e-mail.
so, what made you want to open up a shop here in Tree Hill?
same reason you're coaching the Ravens.
it's home.
and it's good to be home.
what do you think?
I got to be honest -- I think it's the perfect way to continue the legacy of Karen's caf?
I'm just amazed at how quickly you got this place together.
you're very impressive, Brooke Davis.
Yeah, that's what they tell me.
so, is it everything you imagined?
having your own fashion line?
today it is.
ask me again tomorrow.
Hey, so this is it, huh? You're doing it.
Yeah, well, hopefully, it's just the beginning.
wow, well, I can say I was here when it all started.
maybe I should steal something to commemorate the occasion.
well, if there's no stopping you...
bamboo.
lucky bamboo.
it was from Lindsey.
Lucas' Lindsey?
is that, like, her nickname or something?
this is actually really nice of her.
suspiciously nice.
Oh, stop it. Keep this.
it really did just feel like she was coming over here to mark her territory, you know?
and then she said,"I just wanted you to know I'm here."
so she was letting you know that, if you need anything, she's here to help.
she was letting me know she's not going anywhere.
I got to be honest with you.
that just really doesn't sound like her, but, I mean, even if she is doing that and marking her territory, what difference does it make?
it's not like you came back to town for Lucas, right?
no.
I did not come back here for Lucas -- I came back here for me.
good. That's what I thought.
great sound check.
Yeah, really great.
they're local...
and they're unsigned.
you can tell that just by looking at them?
Oh, well, four years in L. A. at least gave me that.
well, what do you think?
I love the house, especially the furniture.
I love the coffee table.
Oh, we found that in Greece two summers ago.
I want it.
you... want the coffee table?
I want everything -- the house, the furniture, and if you can be gone in an hour, I'll throw in an extra $30, 000.
enjoy your new house!
you didn't want Beasley, did you?
no. You can keep beasley.
there's a roast in the oven.
I love roast.
Bye.
you must be lost.
uh, no, actually, I've spent more time on this court than you ever will.
I want you to come back to school.
ain't nothing left for me up there.
isn't anything left.
and there's more to life than basketball, Quentin.
I mean, you got to graduate.
what's it matter to you?
listen to me.
half the kids that drop out of high school have no job, and the ones that do earn a job earn 25% less than the kids that stayed in school and 63% less than the ones that graduated college.
so, for me, it doesn't matter, but for you, Quentin, it matters a lot.
I'm not kidding.
or maybe you're just hot for me, Mrs. James Scott.
all right, I tried.
thank you for meeting with me.
what is this about?
um, well, I think you guys are really great.
look, I'm kind of tired, so if this is just some fan-club crap
Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry.
please, um, sit down.
I own my own record label, and I would really love to sign you guys.
why should we sign with you?
well, I was in L. A. for the last four years working at a major label, but I decided to leave because I thought I could do better on my own.
and when I hear bands like yours, I know I can.
the majors are a mess right now, and so, if you sign with me,
I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure you guys get to be where you want to be.
so, what other bands do you have?
as of right now?
I mean, there's nobody yet.
uh, I wanted you guys to be my first.
look, my ex-girlfriend told me the same thing prom night.
she was a lying bitch.
we're gonna pass, but thanks.
lucky bamboo.
Peyton. You just missed Lucas.
uh, actually, I came by to see you.
great. What's up?
why did you bring me that lucky bamboo?
well, I just - no, I'll tell you why
you were marking your territory, and that's okay. I get it.
but for the record, I am not after Lucas, okay?
I didn't think you were.
well, then, what do you want?
cause, seriously, people are just not that nice.
Peyton, my whole life, I wanted to be an editor, so when I made it, a friend of mine gave me a lucky bamboo for my office.
now, I'm not naive enough to think that I found my way because of some plant on my desk, but that plant was a symbol that I had finally made it.
that's all I was trying to give you a reminder of the first day you started living your dream.
it's good to know you're not after Lucas.
good luck.
man, you ain't gonna believe this.
I guess they got tired of running.
or they just got tired of losing.
nice work, coach.
you too, coach.
how's the physical therapy going?
it hurts.
good. No pain, no gain.
you sound like my dad.
sorry.
I used to be a personal trainer.
I am full of motivational catch phrases.
that's who you were visiting yesterday at the prison -- it was your dad, right?
I'd rather not talk about it.
does Haley know you went to see him?
no, she doesn't.
and I'd like to keep it that way.
I'm not here to meddle.
unless I'm invited in, I mind my own business.
but if she asks me, I won't lie.
that's fair.
and listen, um, it's good that you're here.
I've pretty much been a jackass for the past few months, and Haley deserves better.
I know it's been really hard on her.
you know, if you want to do something nice for Haley, you might want to try investing in a razor.
so, maybe I don't have any other bands.
there's something my label has that the others don't -- me.
and I have a lot of experience, more than you'd think.
and the other thing that I have that none of the other labels have is an interest in you guys.
now, I can have you in a recording studio tomorrow.
so if it is really about the music, you might want to reconsider.
have a good show.
before I go, I need to say something.
of course you do.
you're like a bug that can't be squashed.
you never gave me a chance.
you hated me from the start because of how I look.
it's always about how people look.
I mean, take you.
you dress all uptight, hiding your hot body behind your cold personality.
but at the end of the day, you know you got it.
you know, go hire your hot anchor and hang out with your hot friends and be hot, but you'll never know what you're missing,'cause I'm good at what I do, and I'm gonna prove you wrong.
that was kind of hot. - Yeah.
tough day? - Yeah.
I can't remember the last one that wasn't.
I just think I'm realizing that I can't help everybody, and I still somehow feel responsible.
I don't know why I keep trying.
maybe I'm avoiding this -- you know, coming home.
that's such a terrible thing to say, I know. It just hasn't been easy.
well, you should go inside.
there's someone waiting to see you.
jamie -- he's such a good boy, isn't he?
Bye. - Bye. Thank you.
Where'd you go, jimjams?
what is this?
it's the beginning.
of what?
of the way it's gonna be from now on.
I know that it's gonna take a lot more than dinner...
but I figured it's a start, right?
I've missed you.
so, how was your day?
Oh, enough about me. How was your day?
Yeah, how was your day, mama?
Oh, my day just got a lot better.
well, I can't vouch for any of this, because Jamie made it all.
Oh, no.
Brooke, this place looks great.
think, if I can't sign any bands soon, maybe I can get a job here?
I'm sorry, darling, you're not nearly bitchy enough to work in one of my stores.
Oh, I don't know about that.
I have references. Just ask Lindsey.
Lucas' lLindsey?
does everyone call her that?
were you mean to her?
no, she was marking her territory, and I just called her on it.
she thinks I'm after Lucas.
she said that?
she didn't have to -- it was obvious.
she showed up with this, like, bad-luck bamboo thing and a story about how it was, like, a symbol of my dream, but I'm pretty sure it was just to guilt-trip me.
Peyton --and then -- get this
she says to me,"I just want you to know, I'm here."
what is that?
I mean, you're opening up your own store, and does she bring you a lucky bamboo?
I'm such a bitch.
look on the bright side -- now I'd hire you to work in one of my stores in a second.
no, really, I suck.
Yeah, you do.
matter of fact, it's a wonder that you have any friends at all, but you do.
come with me.
so, the entire class stands up, and I said,"any student that walks out that door fails this quarter."
you didn't say that. - I totally did.
you're like the mean teacher.
that's kind of hot.
well, well, don't you think it's a little past your bedtime, mister?
I think so.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- since it's a special occasion,
I think we should stay up a little later tonight, unless you're too tired.
no, I'm not tired!
here.
I was thinking maybe we could go outside and shoot around with this thing.
is that something you'd like to do with me?
I don't know.
hmm, yeah. I don't really know, either.
no, no, no! Play!
all right, well, let's see you're ready. Show me your jump shot.
nice! Nice.
use that follow-through.
there you go.
surprise.
you rented a house?
well, not exactly.
Brooke, you did not just buy this house.
what are you thinking?
what -- you don't like it?
no, it's incredible!
good,'cause that's your room.
your son left this for you earlier.
one more time.
beautiful. That was awesome.
you'll be doing that on 10-foot baskets someday.
all right, give me some more.
nice!
so, we're gonna give you a chance. Don't let us down.
I won't.
I've been putting on a brave face for a few weeks now.
you have these two gorgeous ex-girlfriends back in town, and I'm trying so hard to be okay with it, but I have to ask you a question, and I promise, I'll never ask it again.
should I be worried about us?
I love you.
that is never gonna change.
you have nothing to worry about.
Hey, you know what?
I just thought of something.
what if Lucas' Lindsey gave you a lucky bamboo because she was marking her territory with you, too?
let it go.
I'm calling her "Lucas' Lindsey" now. God.
look at the view.
look, this place is beautiful, but...
But?
I just worry I'm keeping you from your life.
I know you came down here for me.
you know, in New York, I had everything I thought I wanted -- money, celebrity, success.
but you know what I didn't have?
sunrise with my best friend.
well, isn't that sweet?
what are you doing here?
well, when you stupidly charge a house to the company, we have to confirm the address.
vacation's over.
it's time to get back to work.
forget it. I'm staying here.
stop being a spoiled brat.
there's a flight in a few hours.
I will be on it, and you will be sitting next to me.
no, I'm not going back.
Brooke. - Mother.
I'll see you on the plane, my dutiful daughter.
goodbye, Peyton.
goodbye, Mrs. Davis.
well, your mom's still a bitch.
what are you gonna do?
I still love you, lucas.
Peyton, I...
Lucas asked me to marry him.
what the hell is this?
well, we have this website.
Yeah, we're sports announcers.
everyone get away from the door!
Jim, you can't do this.
it's a little late for that, Mouth.
you're bleeding. We got to get you somewhere safe.
no, I can't! I can't walk. I tried.
Jimmy, please-- please.
I'm sorry
No!
he was my friend.
I, uh...I miss him a lot.
Lucas, look me in the eye and tell me that that kiss did not feel exactly the same as it felt three years ago.
I'm in love with her, Peyton.
take a look at this picture.
what do you see?
there's a high school basketball game tonight somewhere in America, and there's a great story there.
sometimes, to find it, you have to look away...
into the shadows, on the fringe of the obvious.
can you see it?
look closer.
cut! Cut!
great. Really great work, Mia. Excellent.
thank you guys very much.
we can check that and move on.
Hey! - Hey.
how crazy is this? It looks just like your classroom.
it's so crazy.
all right, it's good. Let's move on.
thank you.
um, I kind of need to get out of here.
I don't know if you guys need me for closeups...
no, no, no. You're good.
okay. All right, see you.
okay, about the whole Lucas engagement thing -- I just...
you got to let him go, Peyton.
I know.
it's just hard.
it'll be okay.
I'll see you at the game.
this is so awesome.
what's next?
we go hand-held.
local boys make good.
a new era dawns.
come on, find the story.
tonight's the big night, baby.
first game of the season and broadcasting debut for Marvin Mcfadden.
it's just a taped segment.
I'm not even sure they're gonna run it.
man, they gonna run it.
look, you gonna throw down so hard, they gonna have to run it.
got an angle, right?
Yeah, I'm thinking,"former state champions take over."
something like that.
Yeah, that's all good.
well, look, if you need anything, I got you.
All-access, baby.
relax, dog.
you gonna do great, all right?
Hey, sorry. I'll just be one more minute.
I've never seen Jamie so keyed up.
he's so excited about this game.
everything all right?
I have to tell you something.
it's about Carrie.
I should probably be the one to tell her.
I have to give my two weeks notice.
because I got accepted to a graduate program that I thought I couldn't afford, but I got a last-minute scholarship offer, and I think I have to take it.
well, of course you do.
Congratulations.
we're gonna miss you.
I hope Jamie doesn't take it too hard.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, too.
more than you know.
you, uh, working on the game plan?
actually, uh...I was just thinking about Keith.
wishing he were here, you know?
I've been thinking about Jimmy all week.
what I wouldn't give to trade this day for that one.
I see they took Dan's jersey down in the gym.
I'm glad.
Jimmy'd be proud of you.
Thanks.
you too.
good luck, Luke.
Thanks, Mouth. You too.
Oh, Keith, please help me out tonight.
what you think, ball?
it's good?
Yeah, good.
Hey, Peyton, is that really who you used to be?
Yep, that's me. Come on.
you were really cool. What happened?
watch it.
so, tell me again -- we're going to see the team that your ex-boyfriend coaches, but now he's engaged to Haley's friend, right?
okay.
you want to see where I went to high school or not?
no, totally. I just want to know who we hate before we get there.
you see the girl showing off her cheap-ass engagement ring to my best friend?
Yeah. Lindsey, right?
that's who we hate.
she knows exactly what she's doing.
I cannot believe that Lindsey invited Brooke to the game.
I mean, it's bad enough she's got Lucas, but now she's got to snake in on my friends, too?
I once put a hex on a girl I hated, and it totally worked.
Really? Maybe you could give her a horrible rash or something for the wedding.
totally.
so are we gonna go back or what? I mean, I'm pretty excited about this catfight.
okay, do you want to see the place where I got shot and almost bled to death or what?
the catfight can wait.
Hey, we saved you a seat. - Thank you so much!
Oh, I can't wait to get a good shot of Jamie with my camera that I don't have.
it's in my classroom.
can we go with you?
I'm dying to see teacher girl's classroom.
all right. Come on.
all right, let's go. Listen up.
four years ago, we won a state championship.
and since then, there's been a lot of losing.
but this is a new team, and this is your house.
good teams win at home.
every game.
every game.
and this is a good team.
believe in that.
believe in each other.
it all starts tonight, boys.
a new team new look.
you should win half of your games just for looking so damn good.
you better suit up, too, son.
look at that!
if Quentin's hand isn't right, we might need you.
go, Jamie!
go, Jamie!
this is so weird.
I feel like I haven't walked these halls in 20 years.
Hey.
isn't that Mia?
what are you doing here?
Hey, Peyton. - Hey, check it out.
it's my old friends, Brooke and Haley, and their new pal, Lindsey.
Peyton, we made plans for tonight before you called me a bitch.
bitch? No. No, I did not call you a bitch.
I said I didn't like you.
no, you don't have to make apologies to her, just like I'm not apologizing because I'm engaged to Lucas and she's not.
you know, I really was gonna try to be nice to you, but I think that's officially over.
works for me.
great.
I'm gonna head back.
Hey!
if you get tired dragging that fat ass back to the gym, there is a water fountain down the hall.
whatever, you bulimic bitch.
I can't. There's no handle.
they're fixing them over the weekend.
so what's that mean?
I think it means we're stuck.
help!
help!
somebody!
help us!
somebody!
somebody, please!
somebody get us out of here!
help!
Lindsey, Lindsey, nobody's gonna hear you.
they're all at the game.
we cannot be locked in here.
I am totally claustrophobic.
but it's, like, a huge library.
it's the "locked in" part.
relax. You'll be okay.
okay, they're fixing all the other doors.
no handles.
and the phones seem to be out.
all the calls will go through the office. Nobody's answering.
does anybody have cellphone reception?
cause I got nothing.
I don't.
nobody ever gets cellphone reception in here.
except for me,'cause the world loves me!
I'm gonna call mMouth. I'll have us out of here in two seconds.
Hey, this is Mouth. Please leave me a message.
it went to voice mail.
well, there's got to be somebody else we can call to get out of here.
uh, call the police. 911.
there's someone out there getting murdered, and we're gonna bother the police? No.
there is somebody that we know who's not coaching or playing in this game.
don't ask me. I just moved here.
I don't want to.
Brooke. - I don't even know his number.
what are you talking about?
Brooke's gonna call Owen, her new bartender crush, to get us out.
I am not. It's too soon.
Brooke, we're gonna miss the game.
I don't want to call him!
it violates all the rules of dating etiquette.
I am gonna look desperate, he has to do us a favor, and then he can make fun of me for it.
Oh, my god.
fine.
I will call him, but if he does not sleep with me after this, it is your fault -
all of you.
I think I'm okay with that.
what?
my battery just died!
it's great!
isn't that great?
Brooke, we're stuck!
uh, stuck is not good.
come sit down for a second, okay?
all right, just breathe and close your eyes and try and think of a place that makes you happy and calm.
you got it? Where are you?
I'm with my dad. We're walking near walden pond.
it's fall. The leaves are changing.
you're not here.
you're there.
better?
Yeah.
Hey, Mia, are you okay?
I'm great.
I actually think this is kind of awesome.
I can finally get to know you guys.
I have questions.
no. Now is not the time.
Oh, come on. You guys totally fascinate me.
especially you, Brooke.
Really?
well, in that case, ask away, my dear.
okay.
like, you're really successful, right?
like, really cool and rich?
Yes, yes, and yes.
so why do you let that horrible stink of a mom boss you around all the time?
you should quit being so nosy.
come on, Brooke. You know she's not nice.
I'm not talking about my mom.
she doesn't appreciate you.
she is my mother, all right?
that doesn't make it right.
okay.
it's time for the two new kids to stay the hell out of it, and as for you two, I expect you both to understand.
what's that supposed to mean?
you know what it means.
neither of your moms were around -
at least not in all the time that I've been friends with you.
and I'm sorry for that, but what if you had a chance to have them back in your lives?
Brooke, I would love to have them back -- both of them, all right?
but I would hope that they'd be coming back because they love me, not because they wanted to run my label.
Oh, the label I financed?
easy. I'm with you.
now.
you are with me now, Peyton, but for the last four years, my mom has been with me every day, helping me create a pretty great company.
that's...not true.
I was with you when you created that pretty great company, and so was Peyton.
maybe your mom made it bigger, but you created it all by yourself.
you did.
you made it great before your mom even stepped into the picture.
you guys don't know anything about it.
maybe not, but I do know that a mother's love is unconditional, and you don't have to earn it, and you don't have to sign a fashion label to keep it.
it just is.
you don't know anything about it.
you okay?
I'm thinking I can break this window.
Lindsey, somebody's gonna come get us out of here.
I can do it.
no
okay.
jeez, that chairis really heavy.
Hi.
check it out. I found librarian's stash.
we always knew she was boozy.
do you want some?
whatcha readin'?
she came up with this, Peyton.
the magazine, the high-end clientele -- Victoria did all of it.
I know.
but it's not called"V. Davis," is it?
all those years growing up, I just wanted her to see me.
to see me and appreciate me and maybe love me.
and now that I have it, even if it's for the wrong reasons, it's hard to let it go.
can you understand that?
Yeah.
this is terrible.
it's Lucas' first game, we're stuck in this stupid library.
Ah, I wish we knew the score.
ravens down by 8.
wait, let me refresh.
ravens down by 10.
are you online?
Yeah.
Brooke, Peyton, come here. We got internet.
Hey, you guys want to see me at Trick?
okay, there's got to be a way we can use this to get out.
or at least order a pizza. I'm starving.
no, that's it.
do we need to be thinking about food right now?
we order pizza online. We have it delivered here so we can get out.
okay, Blackwell's Pizzeria -- they are...open.
you can order online, and they deliver.
nice.
so, what are we getting?
what kind of pizza?
I don't know. Mushroom and sausage.
no mushroom, please. - Brooke.
actually, I'm totally with Brooke. Canadian bacon?
canadian bacon. Extra cheese.
you guys - just order the damn pizza.
do not yell at me.
I'll yell at you if I want. Just order it!
freaking sausage, freaking canadian bacon, freaking mushroom -
I want to getthe hell out of here!
we all want to get the hell out of here, okay?
don't yell at me!
calm down!
God.
just no mushroom.
there. It's ordered.
are we all happy now?
What'd we get?
no mushroom, Brooke, okay? No "mush," no "room" --no mushroom!
everybody, please relax, okay? The pizza guy's gonna come, he's gonna let us out, and maybe we'll make the end of the game, so in the meantime, everybody just calm down!
you did a great job with my record, Haley.
thank you.
where did that come from?
I don't know. I just think we tear each other down enough, you know?
and sometimes you should tell people the things that you love about them, like something they're really great at or a quality they have that you admire, and, I don't know, you did a really good job.
courage.
Haley's courageous.
and strong.
and kind.
see, don't you feel like you're pretty awesome now?
Yeah, I kind off do.
okay, do me. What's great about me?
your voiceis an amazing gift.
the fact that you came up with this game.
your boobs.
and your lips.
I would kill for lips like that. You know?
and you've got good legs.
it's like a whole
okay. Before this turns intoa women-in-prison film, I think we should move on.
um, Lindsey.
your eyes are, like, not even fair.
you're also one of the smartest people I know. - I am not.
and you're classy.
you guys...
Peyton, isn't there something nice you'd like to say about Lindsey?
she got decent taste in men.
this game sucks.
I'm intimidated by Peyton.
I spent a year editing a book that was basically a love letter to her.
I watched how caringand meticulous Lucas was with the words he chose for her, like he was still holding on to her.
sometimes I think he still is.
which is why he proposed to you, right?
Yeah, I can see that.
God, I hate this library.
I found it.
a way out?
no. Lucas' book. I never read it.
they replaced the carpet.
this is where Lucas and I hid out during the school shooting, but they changed the carpet.
it doesn't match.
I'm not gonna tell you how to be with Lindsey...
but most of your life, I've known you to take the high road.
I know, Brooke. I'm so sick of looking at her and her precious ring.
you mean your precious ring?
all right. One more.
score me. Score me, Haley.
ravens are down by 9.
halftime.
wait. Hold on.
are you telling me Lucas slept with Peyton, brooke, and you, Lindsey?
uh, yeah. Not all at the same time.
jeez, Haley, you sure you never got in on that?
EW, he's like my brother.
I'm just saying.
jamie looks a lot like him.
Ah, they're like twins.
they are not!
Yes, they are.
and what inbred moron is taking so long with our pizza?
well, well, well.
Oh, my god, 4,000 hitsfor my video at Trick.
listen to these comments.
you rock. Where can I buy this?
that's really great, Mia.
this song is awesome. I'd love to see this chick...naked.
it's just one comment.
no, wait, there's more.
another pop princess who can't sing or play.
she looks like she smells like dirty feet?
what's wrong with people?
you need to stop. Do you know what people use the internet for?
porn and complaining. - Yep.
but that's so not fair.
they have to know there's somebody reading this.
it's the easiest thing in the world to tear down somebody's work.
the hard partis actually creating it.
it's criticism versus creation.
do you love making music? - Yeah.
okay, so, the rest doesn't matter.
easy for you to say. They didn't say you smell like feet.
Oh, sticks and stones, Mia.
Oh, right. This coming from the girl that couldn't handle it when I said I didn't like her.
okay.
let's just check the score cardon this one, miss pity me.
you dated the guy two years ago, you disappeared, then you come back and expect him to drop everything for the love of your bony, jobless ass.
wtf?
okay, D.U. I.
nice work, Haley.
better save drinky here before I kick her spoiled ass all the way back to Walden Pond.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
guess this is the second time you'll be bleeding all over this library.
you think that's funny?!
Ken Smith is in the lib-ra-zee!
Oh, my god.
Brooke, it's, see
No!
you idiot!
the door is locked!
no, it's not. I just walked in, Brooke.
from the outside, Tim.
the door is locked from the outside.
we cannot get out!
girl, chill.
I'll just call somebodyat the pizza place and have them send someone -
I left my phone in my scooter.
motorcycle.
it's a motorcycle.
well, since we're lockedin here all alone...
who wants a piece?
extra sausage.
ravens trail by 9.
sold-out crowd.
come on, Mouth. There's a great story here.
find it.
Oh, my god.
if you had to eat any part of a person to stay alive, what would you eat?
what?
like -- I don't know -- say we ran out of food and Haley died.
thanks a lot.
okay, someone else dies, and we need to survive.
what do you eat?
I know what I'm starting with.
don't say it, perv.
love handles.
I'd make, like, beef jerky out of their love handles.
you could snack on that for days.
I so would not eat someone's love handles.
well, you're gonna starve, and we're all gonna eat you.
no one gonna's eat me, either.
No!
you know, I could eat your neck like a vampire.
you guys, seriously.
what's the big deal?
you're dead, and I'm hungry.
Yeah, don't you want us to live?
we're hungry, Brooke.
okay.
Chow down, but I am gonna haunt each and every one of you.
I believe in ghosts.
totally.
Yeah, don't even get me started.
do you believein ghosts, Lin?
um... I think if someonedies suddenly, especially before their time, maybe they get confused.
they don't know to leave a place.
you think they're still here, then?
Jimmy Edwards and Keith?
I wish you were here tonight, Jim.
we were supposed to do this together.
and this is a picture of my son.
a lot of people sayhe looks like me, but I'm not quite sure he's that handsome.
he's really something.
what's his name?
mine's snow day.
my happy place.
Lindsey's is Walden Pond.
mine's a snow day in Ohio.
no school.
I'd stay in bed under the warm covers, and my mom would bring me hot chocolate.
how 'bout you, Peyton? Your mom ever bring you hot chocolate on a snow day?
no, I didn't have a whole lotof snow days.
Brooke and I did build a pretty killer snow fort once.
and you sat in it, and you worried that your lives were about to change.
just because you edited a book about my life doesn't mean you know anything about me.
I didn't mean anything by it.
I was just -- it's a beautiful story.
that's nice, Mia.
Thanks. I've had this melody forever and just don't have the lyrics yet.
why don't you keep playing it and maybe we can help you?
I think maybe we should probably just work on that in the studio, alone.
Oh, for god's sakes. What am I gonna do --steal Mia's song?
I don't know. Songs? Friends?
what about you, scraggly?
I heard you stole Lucas from Brooke once.
pot, meet kettle.
ass, meet face.
pot, meet kettle, ass, meet face
I don't think that's gonna work, guys.
wait! That's hot!
no, drop that bomb again! I got something.
yeah?
all right, ready?
okay.
one, two, three, four...
straight from the ghetto, packing wood like Geppetto ain't gonna bathe till I look like Jared Leto
nice.
don't laugh at him.
uh -- you're right.
creation versus criticism.
let me try one.
two, three, four...
my name's Peyton fake, blond Peyton
I don't have a boyfriend 'cause I'm a bitch
play it again, Mia.
guys, we need to stop.
one, two, three, four...
her name's Lindsey --man-faced Lindsey and her fiance proposed to me first with the very same ring!
you're lying. - Oh, you didn't know?
Peyton. - No, is she gonna cry?
stop it. - Go ahead --let's cry, little rich girl.
I said stop it.
is daddy gonna throw you a great, big, huge wedding at Walden Pond for his little cry baby daughter?
Peyton, you don't know what you're talking about!
it's fine, Haley.
daddy's gonna make everything better for the little rich girl that got everything she ever wanted!
he's dead!
all right, Peyton?
he's dead.
he died two years ago from cancer, but not until he couldn't walk or talk or even recognize me.
does that make you happy?
does that make you feel better?
that his death is with me every day, that I was the one who had to turn off the ventilator because my mother was too destroyed to do it?
you want to hear the sound he made before he took that last breath?
Oh,'cause I can still hear it exactly how it sounded.
Oh, does that make you happy?
are you glad that my life isn't perfect? - Lindsey
I used to admire the Peyton from the book.
she seemed so noble...kind.
I wish she were here, Peyton.
that version of you.
what happened to her?
God, the last time I was trapped in the school was the shooting.
you know how Lindsey and I got so close?
she was, um, editing Lucas' book, and I still wasn't really sure about her 'cause I was rooting for Lucas to be with my friend Peyton...
or maybe even Brooke.
um, anyway, she -- she was working on the chapter about the shooting, and she said to me,"I want this to be Lucas' best writing"
the best he has in him -because Peyton deserves it.
Jimmy and Keith deserve it, and that day deserves it.
and we've been friends ever since.
can I please talk with you?
I'm sorry. God, Lindsey, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry for what I said about your father, okay?
I lost my mom to cancer, and I...
I'm sorry.
I don't know what it is, but for whatever reason, you bring out the insecurities in me, and I end up being the worst possible version of myself.
welcome to the club.
Haley told me what you said about wanting to get that chapter right in the book, the one about the school shooting.
and I think that's what makes it so hard, you know -
the fact that Lucas has found this person that's so great and that has such a big heart.
and it was never my ring.
I was just trying to hurt you.
and the only reason I recognized it is 'cause that's the ring Keith gave Karen when he proposed to her, before he walked into this school and never walked out again.
so you have to know how much Lucas loves you if he wanted you to have it.
why would you tell me that?
so you stop doubting it.
so we stop doing this.
I mean, god, you gave me a clean slate, and I said something dumb that I didn't even mean, and I was just too stubborn to take it back.
I guess it's obvious that I'm not the Peyton in the book anymore.
the truth is, I never was.
I think you were.
and I think you still are.
it's just... you're not that couple anymore.
and in a way, it breaks my heart,'cause I really was rooting for them.
but Lucas and I have written our own chapter now, and that's a chapteri won't apologize for.
no, you don't have to.
and you don't have a man face or a big ass.
the fact is, you have a pretty great ass, so...
okay.
before this turns into a women-in-prison film...
maybe we should move on.
moving on sounds... overdue.
mono.
monkey.
Yes!
well, guess it's time for me to get back to work.
but you're forgetting something, short bus.
the door's locked.
no big deal.
what?
Oh, my god! Did you know how to do that this whole time?!
why didn't you say something?
I miss you guys.
nobody keeps in touch anymore.
would you look at that?
you can still see where Dan's jersey used to hang.
it's kind of eerie, huh?
you know, that's weird. I expected to see Lindsey here.
have you talked to Haley tonight?
now that you mention it, no, but I've been trying to avoid her.
what's going on?
you kissed Peyton, didn't you?
okay, I know you want to call mea dick, and that's fine
I kissed Carrie.
you're a dick.
I know.
actually, she kissed me, but it still happened, and I feel terrible about it, man.
I'm not that guy, Luke.
are you sure? I mean, if you had another chance to do it, would you do it again?
no. Absolutely not. I love Haley.
okay.
Luke, every time I try to keep something from Haley, it just makes it worse.
I'm gonna tell her.
she deserves to know.
ready to go home now, daddy?
I got to stop being my father and start being the father my son thinks I am.
there was a high school basketball game tonight somewhere in America.
a team won, and a team lost.
that's not the real story.
the real story is about fathers and sons.
it's about life and time.
and change.
all right.
I'll see you later.
see ya.
girls and boys went to the game.
they dressed pand hoped to fit in.
some did.
some didn't.
if is okay, I thought, since I came with them
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go.
I want you to.
and you know why?
cause you are my best friend, Brooke Davis, and you always will be.
Yes, I will.
love you.
it's a story that has history and chapters yet to be written.
you ready, rock star?
my name's Peyton Fake, blond Peyton
I don't have a boyfriend 'cause I'm a bitch what? It's catchy.
whatever. You look like you smell like feet.
Hi.
I was looking for you.
I was here.
whatcha thinking about?
he'd be proud of you.
there was a high schoolbasketball game tonight somewhere in America.
reporters will report.
they'll tell you who the high scorer was and what the keys to the game were.
but that's not the real story.
as a matter of fact, that's not the story at all.
she's THE FIRST THING I THINK ABOUT EVERY DAY.
how IS SHE?
does SHE MISS ME LIKE I MISS HER?
how DO I GET HER BACK?
and THEN ANOTHER DAY WITHOUT HER BEGINS.
Oh, MY GOD. I HAVE TO PEE.
what DAY IS IT?
what TIME IS IT?
what THE HELL DID I DRINK LAST NIGHT?
Mmm, MILLICENT... YOU SMELL SO GOOD.
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK.
sure, I GUESS I CAN BE A LITTLE LATE.
what DO YOU MEAN I'M FIRED? I WASN'T EVEN THAT LATE!
how AM I GONNA PAY MY RENT?
would YOU LIKE FRIES WITH THAT, SIR?
God MY GIRL IS UP
morning.

you KNOW, I'M HUNGRY THIS MORNING. I AM STARVING.
smells GOOD IN HERE.
Haley: YEAH, I MADE SOME FRENCH TOAST. NICE.
it's TOTALLY GOOD, DADDY. It's totally good.
that's NOT WHAT I MEANT, BUT THAT SS GOOD,
good MORNING.
what's YOUR DAY LIKE?
mostly JUST PLAYING.
my DAY'S NOT BAD EITHER.
I'm JUST GONNA FINISH GRADING THESE PAPERS
and THEN GO OVER TO SEE PEYTON FOR A LITTLE BIT,
and THEN YOU AND I HAVE TO INTERVIEW THE N-A-N-N-I-E-S.
I HATE IT WHEN YOU SPELL.
don't SAY, "HATE."
sorry. I JUST THINK IT'S D-U-M.
Wow.
add A "B" TO THE END OF THAT, OR YOU WILL BE, TOO.
Jamie, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT GOING TO PRACTICE WITH ME TODAY?
can I?
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S A BIG STEP.
what DO YOU THINK, MOM?
please BE CAREFUL.
sweet! I'LL GO GET MY JERSEY.
Thanks, MAMA. I L-O-V-E YOU!
I L-O-V-E YOU, TOO, SMARTY-PANTS.
kid's GOT YOUR BRAINS.
I JUST NOW FIGURED OUT THAT YOU WERE SPELLING "NANNIES." WHATEVER.
they're GETTING HERE AT 5: 00, BY THE WAY. OKAY.
and IF YOU RUN INTO QUENTIN AT PRACTICE,
will YOU TELL HIM HE'S DONE WITH HIS CHAPTER REPORTS ON "LES MIS"?
that's GOOD.
now IF ONLY HE COULD FIGURE OUT HIS JUMP SHOT.
I'll SEE YOU. BYE, BABY.
that DESK LOOKS GOOD ON YOU, COACH.
welcome BACK, COACH SCOTT.
so, HOW MY BOY DOING?
boy's GOOD.
sorry I WAS OUT OF TOUCH FOR SO LONG.
Hey, YOU GOT TO DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO, RIGHT?
I JUST WISH I WAS ABLE TO HELP YOU SOMEHOW.
you DID. YOU RAN THE TEAM FOR THE LAST MONTH.
how THEY DOING?
you KNOW. YOU WIN SOME. YOU LOSE SOME.
and HOW MANY "SOME" DID YOU LOSE?
you LOST EIGHT GAMES?
Yeah, BUT WE WON FOUR.
well, THREE PLUS THE FIRST ONE, BUT YOU WAS HERE FOR THAT ONE.
look, I KNOW THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WAS HOPING FOR.
and I'M TAKING ALL THE BLAME FOR THIS.
but I'M GONNA KEEP IT REAL WITH YOU.
sucks, AND IT'S ALL HIS FAULT.
I MEAN, HE AIN'T HIT A SHOT SINCE YOU LEFT.
because THEY'RE DOUBLING HIM.
no. HIS HAND IS MESSED UP.
I MEAN, WE ICE IT CONSTANTLY, BUT...
it JUST AIN'T BEEN RIGHT SINCE HE PUNCHED THAT KNUCKLEHEAD OVER AT TRIC.
what's "Q" SAY?
he SAID HE HAD IT CHECKED OUT.
all RIGHT. I'LL TALK TO HIM.
see, THAT'S THE THING.
he ASKED ME NOT TO SAY NOTHING TO YOU ABOUT THIS.
he THINK THE INJURY GONNA COST HIM A SCHOLARSHIP.
I'll TELL YOU WHAT'S GONNA COST HIM A SCHOLARSHIP -- PLAYING INJURED AND GOING 4-8.
Yeah.
let's GET HIM IN HERE.
uncle LUCAS!
Hey! THERE'S THE MAN!
I MISSED YOU, BOY.
daddy SAID YOU WERE ON A SHIP.
did YOU SEE ANY PIRATES?
Yeah, I SAW A COUP PIRATE SHIPS,
but THEY DIDN'T WANT ANY PART OF ME.
you WANT TO SHOW ME YOUR JUMP SHOT?
all RIGHT.
welcome BACK, LUKE.

I'm WORKING ON IT.
Oh, MY GOD.
Oh MY GOD
the MACY'S PRESENTATION! I FORGOT!
I REMEMBERED. IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE. WE JUST NEED YOUR DESIGN SKETCHES.
thank YOU.
you HAVE REALLY STEPPED UP,
especially WITH YOU-KNOW-WHO OUT OF THE PICTURE.
but...
but WHAT? AM I IN TROUBLE?
no.
I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING THAT YOU ARE WAY TOO VALUABLE TO JUST BE MY ASSISTANT ANYMORE,
so HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT A LITTLE RAISE AND A LITTLE PROMOTION?
Oh, MY GOSH! I DON'T KNOWHAT TO SAY.
what's MY TITLE GONNA BE? SOMETHING COOL, I HOPE.
we'll FIGURE ALL THAT OUT, BUT WE HAVE TO GET YOU BACK TO NEW YORK FIRST.
clothes OVER BRO'S.
this IS SHE.
Oh.
Oh.
no. ABSOLUTELY, I CAN.
I MEAN, I WILL. YES.
thank YOU.
Milly: BROOKE, I'M SO HAPPY, REALLY, BUT...
I'm NOT SURE I CAN GO BACK TO NEW YORK.
that's OKAY.
change OF PLANS. I'M GONNA NEED YOU HERE.
Oh? OH, GOOD!
Why? WHAT'S WRONG?
I'm GONNA BE A MOM
Brooke, I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOURE GONNA BE A MOM
that WAS THE LADY FROM THE AGENCY.
the HORRIBLE WOMAN WHO SAID SHE WOULDN'T COMMEND YOU FOR ADOPTION?
she SAID IT'S LIKE A SPECIAL CASE, LIKE A FOSTER-CARE THING.
Oh, MY
I HAVE TO GET READY, AND I CAN'T GET THIS IN MY BAG!
okay. FIRST OF ALL, YOU DON'T NEED THIS.
what DO YOU NEED? WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH?
I DON'T KNOW.
I've NEVER HAD A BABY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT BABIES NEED.
I JUST
I HAVE TO GO, AND I CANNOT GET THIS IN MY BAG!
once AGAIN, YOU DON'T NEED THIS.
now, JUST CALM DOWN.
okay, WHERE ARE MY KEYS?
they're IN YOUR HAND.
but I'M NOT SURE YOU SHOULD BE DRIVING.
let ME GET YOU SOME WATER. MILLICENT.
they're GIVING ME A BABY.
there's SOMETHING MISSING UP ON THE WALL.
there USED TO BE ANOTHER ONE.
what WAS IT?
that WAS YOUR GRANDFATHER'S JERSEY.
grandpa DAN?
why'd THEY TAKE IT DOWN?
because OF THE BAD THINGS HE DID.
people DECIDED THEY DIDN'T WANT IT UP THERE ANYMORE.
you DO BAD THINGS SOMETIMES, DADDY,
and YOURS IS STILL UP THERE.
not THAT BAD.
ho, HO! THERE HE IS!

I HAVE NEWS, BOYFRIEND.
I MIGHT BE GETTING A PROMOTION AND STAYING IN TREE HILL!
I MIGHT BE GETTING A PROMOTION AND LEAVING TREE HILL.
what?
Why?
before I GOT THE JOB WITH THE LOCAL STATI I SENT AUDITION TAPES EVERYWHERE.
there's A GOOD STATION IN OMAHA,
and THEY SAW THE RAVENS FEATURE I DID, AND...
they OFFER ME A JOB
in NEBRASKA?
Yeah.
the NEAREST CLOTHES OVER BRO'S LOCATION TO OMAHA IS THIS ONE.
Yeah, I FIGURED.
well, IS IT REALLY THAT MUCH BETTER THAN WHERE YOU'RE AT, MARVIN?
I MEAN, LIKE YOU SAID, YOU'VE ALREADY DONE ONE FEATURE HERE.
maybe YOU'LL GET TO DO MORE.
maybe, BUT IT WAS REALLY JUST 'CAUSE THEY WERE IN A BIND.
this W BE A FULL-TIME ON-AIR POSITION.
it's A SMALL MARKET, BUT IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
you SHOULD TAKE IT. BUT
if IT GETS YLOSER TO YOUR DREAM, THEN YOU SHOULD TAKE IT.
I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT EASY.
why NOT?
because YOU'RE PART OF MY DREAM, TOO.
Milly, I KNOW WE JUST STARTED OUT, BUT I LOVE BEING WITH YOU,
and I...
I GUESS I WAS HOPING WE HAD A FUTURE...TOGETHER.
was THAT TOO EARLY?
did I FREAK YOU OUT?
I FREAKED YOU OUT, DIDN'T I? NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
there IS NO WAY THOSE WORDS COULD HAVE BEEN TOO EARLY
not COMING FROM YOU.
just PROMISE ME THAT IF YOU DO TAKE THE JOB
that I CAN HAVE YOUR ROOM, BECAUSE I'D REALLY LIKE TO FIND A PLACE TO STAY
that's NOT PAY-BY-THE-DAY.
what?
I KNOW IT'S REALLY ROUGH, BUT I WAS THINKING
Yes. BUT IT'S OKAY IF YOU WANT
will YOU STOP? THE ANSWER IS YES, OKAY?
I've BEEN WAITING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT AND BUY THE NEXT HALEY JAMES RECORD,
so OF COURSE I WANT TO RECORD IT.
it MIGHT BE KIND OF FUN, HUH?
well, YOU DID HAVE A MAJOR-LABEL DEBUT THAT DID PRETTY GOOD,
so IT IS GOOD BUSINESS FOR ME, BUT, YES, IT'S GONNA BE A BLAST.
Yeah.
what DO YOU SAY?
I SAY IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED RIGHT NOW.
well, GUESS WHAT.
me
what?
I MEAN, YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE THE NEXT MIRACLE'S GONNA COME FROM.
it's BROOKE.
Oh. HEY, BROOKE!
Hey, WHAT'S GOING ON?
it's a miracle!
uh, YEAH. WE JUST SAID THAT.
what, DID YOU BUG MY OFFICE?
they're GIVING ME A BABY!
UM...HOLD ON. WAIT. WHAT? WHAT?
the LADY FROM THE AGENCY CALLED THIS MORNING,
and THEY'RE SENDING ME
a PURPLE MONKEY?
you're ADOPTING A PURPLE MONKEY?
no, not adopting and not monkey.
I'll EXPLAIN IT ALL LATER. PEYTON, HOW CRAZY IS THIS?
no, Brooke, honey, that's awesome.
God, HALEY AND I THOUGHT WE HAD BIG NEWS.
Why? What's your news?
we're GONNA MAKE AN ALBUM TOGETHER.
Oh, WHATEVER. I'M GETTING A BABY.
I HAVE TO GO. I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
excuse ME.
Wow. TODAY'S KIND OF FUN.
listen, "Q," I KNOW IT LOOKS GRIM,
but, HEY, WE'LL HAVE THAT THING OFF BY THE PLAYOFFS.
playoffs? MAN, WE 4-8.
Hey, WE'RE GONNA FIGURE IT OUT. ALL RIGHT?
just, UH, HANG IN THERE.
Yeah, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO COACH TAYLOR,
if YOU DON'T MIND...
alone.
we'll BE DOWNSTAIRS.
Q, KEEP YOUR HEAD UP, ALL RIGHT?
listen, KID -- THANKS FOR NOTHING, MAN.
I TRUSTED YOU, ALL RIGHT?
I PUT MY ASS ON THE LINE FOR YOU EVERY SINGLE NIGHT, MAN.
Quentin, YOU NEEDED THIS.
I NEEDED THIS?!
I -- YOU KNOW, I NEEDED A SCHOLARSHIP.
I NEEDED YOU TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. THAT'S WHAT I NEEDED.
but YOU WENT ALL UNCLE TOM ON ME AS SOON AS MASSA LUCAS GOT BACK, HUH?
you KNOW WHAT?
when YOUR WRIST HEALS ERYTHING'S OKAY,
I'm GONNA LET YOU TAKE THAT BACK.
but FOR NOW...
just CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY.
Hi, GRANDPA.
Hi, JAMIE.
you BOYS WANT TO JUMP ME AGAIN, NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.
Hey.
we're NOT HAVING
not HAVING WHAT, SON?
you FOLLOWING JAMIE AROUND.
I've SEEN YOU, OKAY, OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL.
I've SEEN YOU DRIVING PAST THE HOUSE.
and NOW YOU JUST HAPPEN TO BE AT THE HOSPITAL? NATHAN, STOP.
I WAS IN PRISON FOR A LONG TIME, OKAY?
I WAS JUST GETTING A CHECKUP.
but THE TRUTH IS, I WAS HOPING
no, DON'T, DAN. DON'T HOPE.
you HEAR ME?
there's NO HOPE FOR YOU.
I GUESS I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.
grandpa DAN SEEMS NICE.
how COME EVERYONE'S ALWAYS MAD AT HIM?
you LOVE CHESTER, DON'T YOU?
well, WHAT IF GRANDPA DAN HURT CHESTER
and TOOK HIM AWAY SO YOU COULD NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN?
I GUESS I WOULD BE REALLY MAD AT HIM...
and SAD, TOO.
Yeah.
well, THAT'S HOW WE FEEL.
I JUST THINK THAT'S KIND OF AN AWFUL THING TO SAY.
Yes, I'M MAD.
Oh, YOU DON'T THINK I SHOULD BE MAD?
I THOUGHT I WAS JUST GONNA HAVE ONE BABY IN MY LIFE, BUT FINE.
I HAVE TO GO.
holy COW!
stupid OWEN.
a LITTLE BABY TALK, AND HE TOTALLY FREAKS OUT.
well, NOTHING LIKE FOISTING A BABY ON A GUY YOU'VE ALMOST KISSED.
and A CONFIRMED BACHELOR, AT THAT.
WHATY? WHATEVER.
he's GONNA COME OVER LATER,
and WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT IT OR FIGHT ABOUT IT,
but IT DOESN'T MATTER
because BABY AND BROOKE ARE GONNA BE FINE.
Yeah, I THINK "BABY AND BROOKE" NEEDS A LITTLE EXPLANATION
like WHO, WHEN, AND HOW, FOR STARTERS.
okay. SO, THE ADOPTION AGENCY HAS THIS PROGRAM
where BABIES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WHO NEED MAJOR SURGERIES AND STUFF COME OVER TO THE U. S.
and DOCTORS DONATE THEIR TIME TO FIX THEM UP
and THEN THEY GO HOME.
Oh. THAT'S GREAT!
it's KIND OF A "WHENEVER THEY CAN SQUEEZE YOU IN" SORT OF THING,
and THE AGENCY HAD A FAMILY AT WAS SUPPOSED TO HOST THE BABY DROP OUT, SO THEY SAID THIS COULD BE A GREAT TRIAL RUN FOR ME.
when DOES THE BABY SHOW UP? IS IT A BOY OR A GIRL?
and ARE HIS PARENTS COMING, TOO?
okay. SHE'S A GIRL, AND SHE GETS HERE TOMORROW.
her PARENTS DON'T COME WITH HER,
and THEY DIDN'T TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER.
they're JUST SORT OF GONNA HAND HER OVER,
and WE GO FROM THERE.
and CHECK IT OUT.
I GOT HER...
a PURPLE MONKEY LIKE THE ONE I USED TO HAVE.
that's SO CUTE!
and DID YOU GET HER ANYTHING ELSE?
Yeah, I GOT ALL THIS STUFF.
I MEAN, LIKE, YOU KNOW...FOOD...
or, I MEAN, A CRIB. ...AND STUFF.
I GOT A LITTLE SIDETRACKED?
okay. WHY DON'T WE GO TO MY HOUSE
and WE'LL GO THROUGH SOME OF JAMIE'S OLD THINGS?
Really? YES.
come ON, YOU PURPLE MONKEY.
I'm SO EXCITED! ME TOO.
Hey, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
looking FOR PLACES TO LIVE.
well, STOP, BECAUSE I'VE FOUND YOU A PLACE.
with ME.
I PASSED ON THE OMAHA JOB.
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOOD AT WHAT I DO, MILLICENT,
and I'LL JUST WORK HARD AND
hope THE STATION GIVES ME ANOTHER SHOT.
are YOU SURE?
that I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING? I DON'T KNOW.
but ABOUT US? YEAH. I'M SURE.
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU, MILLICENT.
but YOU SAID YOU NEEDED A PLACE TO STAY,
and I THOUGHT... YOU SHOULD MOVE IN WITH ME.
but...I CAN'T.
I MEAN...
look, I KNOW IT'S SOON, BUT YOU'LL SAVE A FORTUNE ON RENT,
and YOU'LL GET TO SEE ME EVERY DAY.
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
I'd LIKE TO, BUT I JUST CAN'T.
sorry.
but I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE STAYING.
Haley, THANK YOU.
this IS GREAT.
sure.
listen, HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO HOW DIFFICULT IT'S GONNA BE TO GIVE THIS BABY UP
after THE SURGERY? YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO FOUGHT FOR HER BROOKE
I KNOW.
but SHE NEEDS HELP, RIGHT?
Yeah.
Hey. WHAT'S GOING ON?
Hi.
Hi, AUNT BROOKE!
Hi, BEST BOY EVER!
I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU. WHAT IS IT?
Hey. I FOUND THE CAR SEAT.
surprise.
it MUST HAVE BEEN GOOD TO SPEND TIME WITH YOUR MOM AND LILY AND ANDY.
Yeah. I THINK WE ALL NEEDED IT.
Plus, THE VIEW WASN'T TOO BAD, EITHER.
Yeah, I'M SURE IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
so, UH, YOU AND HALEY ARE GONNA MAKE A RECORD, HUH?
that's GREAT.
actually, I WAS MEANING TO ASK YOU
I MEAN, IT'S TOTALLY COOL IF YOU SAY NO,
but, UM, I WAS THINKING, TO CUT DOWN ON STUDICOSTS,
maybe I WOULD BUILD A SMALL STUDIO IN THE OFFICE.
but IT'S YOUR SPACE, SO...
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
I MEAN, I'LL ASK MY MOM, BUT, YEAH, I THINK IT'S SMART.
I DON'T BLAME YOU, PEYTON.
Luke... AT ALL FOR ANY OF IT.
I FEEL BAD FOR YOU, I FEEL BAD FOR LINDSEY,
and I FEEL RESPONSIBLE SOMEHOW.
and I REALLY HOPE THAT DOESN'T COME OFF AS ARROGANT, OKAY?
but I KNOW THIS HURT YOU.
she's COMING BACK, PEYTON.
she LOVES ME.
and I LOVE HER.
it's GONNA BE OKAY.
I HOPE SO.
it's OPEN.
that KID'S A LOT HAIRIER THAN I THOUGHT HE'D BE.
very FUNNY.
and "HE" IS GONNA BE A "SHE.
I GUESS YOU TALKED TO OWEN.
Yep.
how YOU DOIN'?
okay. A LITTLE FREAK OUT BUT OKAY.
is HE WITH YOU?
no.
weird. HE'S COMING OVER SOON.
actually, HE'S NOT.
that's KIND OF WHY I'M HERE.
Oh.
okay.
you KNOW, BROOKE, OWEN'S MY FRIEND,
and I KNOW HE'S REALLY INTO YOU, BUT...
he's JUST KIND OF ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT HIS INDEPENDENCE, TOO, YOU KNOW?
I GUESS I DIDN'T KNOW.
he's JUST A LITTLE THRTTD WITH ALL THE BABY STUFF.
Yeah, HE SAID THAT ON THE PHONE.
look, DID HE SEND YOU OVER HERE TO TALK TO ME?
are WE IN JUNIOR HIGH NOW?
he DIDN'T SEND ME OVER,
and HE'S NOT COMING BY EITHER.
then WHY DID YOU?
well...
I'm TAKING OFF.
I THOUGHT I'D SAY GOODBYE AND CONGRATULATIONS.
and MAYBE I WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE ONE MORE TIME.
probably WHY OWEN'S NOT COMING BY.
what IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
well, HE PROBABLY FIGURES
if HE LOOKED IN THOSE EYES ONE MORE TIME,
he'll CAVE ON THE WHOLE INDEPENDENCE THING.
anyways, CALL ME IF YOU NEED ANYTHING...
someone TO TALK TO, NEW CARPETS...
I DON'T KNOW, A HUSBAND...
I'll SEE YOU AROUND.
Hey, BROOKE?
don't TAKE THE OWEN STUFF TOO PERSONALLY.
I WON'T.
Yeah, YOU WILL.
I KNOW HOW YOU ARE.
it's -- IT'S JUST A BIG DEAL.
it's KIDS.
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S JUST ONE,
but IF YOU REALLY WANT A FAMILY, SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE FOREVER...
"forever" SCARES A LOT OF US.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi. CAN I TALK TO YOU?
sure. COME ON IN.
what's, UH -- WHAT'S WRONG?
um, MAYBE NOTHING... I HOPE.
okay, JUST HAVE A SEAT. WHAT'S UP?
well, I THINK I'LL STAND.
actually, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK
some WATER OR AN APPLE MARTINI WITH A CHERRY, IF YOU HAVE IT?
okay, YOU'RE KIND OF FREAKING ME OUT.
the LAST TIME SOMEONE ENTERED THE APARTMENT LIKE THIS,
it WAS SKILLS, AND HE THOUGHT HE'D KILLED CHESTER.
Jamie's BUNNY?
Yeah, BUT IT TURNS OUT HE WAS JUST, LIKE, A REALLY HEAVY SLEEPER, APPARENTLY.
well, IT'S NOT THAT.
it's JUST I KNOW I SORT OF FREAKED YOU OUT
when YOU ASKED ME TO STAY HERE, AND, WELL, THERE'S A REASON.
great. I KNEW IT.
what?
I FIGURED THIS WAS JUST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
there's JUST A REASON WE CAN'T SLEEP IN THE SAME BED.
Oh, NO. WHAT?
this IS LIKE "THE CRYING GAME," RIGHT? MARVIN!
hairy BACK? MARVIN.
well, IT'S EITHER THAT OR YOU'RE COMPLETELY REPULSED BY ME.
I'm A VIRGIN.
Really?
Yes.
and CONSIDERING YOUR LAST GROSS BOSS-LADY HOOKUP,
you're CLEARLY NOT, AND I AM JUST NOT READY TO
how DID I FIND YOU?
what?
such A PERFECT GIRL WHO'S SMART AND SWEET AND...
so AWESOME.
go ON.
Milly, I WOULD NEVER PRESSURE YOU ABOUT SEX.
I JUST -- I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.
but
I MEAN, WE COULD EVEN GET TWO BEDS, IF YOU WANT...
although, IF I CATCH YOU SNEAKING INTO MINE,
I'm TELLING SKILLS.
I AM SO INTO YOU, AND...
I WANT YOU HERE.
will YOU SAY YES?
okay. YES.
if YOU THINK IT CAN WORK.
it CAN.
it DOES.
so, I SEE YOU KNOW CPR,
and YOU'RE ALSO A LIFEGUARD.
Yes.
have YOU EVER KISSED ANY OF THE HUSBANDS YOU WORKED FOR?
okay, UH...
no.
well...
sorry.
so, NATHAN... HALEY TELLS ME YOU LIKE TO WATCH YOUR NANNY SWIM NAKED IN THE POOL?
I GUESS I DESERVED THAT.
Hey, BROOKE.
you OKAY?
I THINK I MADE A BIG MISTAKE.
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT, ISN'T IT?
if I WANTED A "LITTLE LATE FOR THAT,"
I WOULD HAVE CALLED PEYTON.
you ARE SUPPOSED TO SAY, "NO, YOU DIDN'T. YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE."
no, YOU DIDN'T. YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
it DOESN'T COUNT NOW.
so, YOU GOT A PURPLE MONKEY, HUH?
just LIKE YOU HAD.
you REMEMBER THAT?
of COURSE.
I DO KNOW SOME THINGS ABOUT YOU, BROOKE DAVIS.
you're GONNA BE A GREAT MOM.
I'm NOT EVEN GONNA BE A MOM.
I JUST FIX HER UP, AND THEN I HAVE TO SEND HER BACK.
well, IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT, WHO WOULD?
Owen THINKS I'M BEING SELFISH.
he THINKS I JUST WANT WHAT I WANT.
well, I'D SAY IT'S THE OPPOSITE. RIGHT?
I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO HELP LITTLE GIRL GET THE CARE THAT SHE NEEDS
and GET TO THE REST OF HER LIFE.
so DO I.
but WHAT IF I DO SOMETHING WRONG, LUKE?
what IF I HURT HER? WHAT IF I BREAK HER?
I MEAN, I RUSHED INTO THIS, AND I'M SCARED.
you KNOW WHAT?
when IT COMES TO SINGLE MOMS,
I HAD A PRETTY SPECIAL ONE.
and IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'RE A LITTLE SCARED.
but YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.
Thanks.
thanks FOR COMING OVER.
you THINK SHE'LL LIKE THE PURPLE MONEY?
I THINK THAT SHE'S GONNA LOVE THE GIRL WHO GIVES IT TO HER.
Yeah.
Jamie's OUT COLD.
I WISH I COULD SLEEP LIKE THAT. YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.
so, I'M SORRY YOU COULDN'T FIND A NANNY THAT YOU COULD TRUST AROUND ME.
too SOON
the TRUTH IS, I JUST WANT JA ALL TO MYSELF RIGHT NOW.
but I ALSO WANT MY JOB AND I WANT MY MUSIC
and I WANT ALONE TIME WITH YOU.
well, YOU SHOULD TAKE A BREAK FROM THAT.
let ME GO THROUGH THOSE THINGS.
I'll TRY TO FIND A PERSON THAT'S REALLY UGLY WITH A LOT OF GREAT REFERENCES.
actually, YOU CAN'T,
because I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET A WORKOUT IN.
you KNOW, OUR THERAPIST SAID THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT WE LOVE, SO...
I THINK SHE'S RIGHT.
I'm PROBABLY REALLY GONNA SUCK, YOU KNOW.
you ARE GONNA FIND OUT SOMETIME RIGHT?
thank YOU, HALES...
for EVERYTHING.
you're WELCOME.
thank YOU BACK.
you LUCKY, MAN.
I WAS GONNA BREAK THAT SCORIATITLE AND PULL THAT OLD LAUNDRY UP OFF THE WALL.
luck HAS NOTHING TO DOTH IT.
I'm JUST BETTER THAN YOU.
how YOU HOLDING UP?
how YOU THINK?
if SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TOLD ME YOUR OLD SORRY ASS WOULD BE BACK PLAYING BEFORE MINE,
I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED THEIR ASS OUT THE GYM.
what YOU TRYING TO DO -- MAKE SOME KIND OF COMEBACK?
trying TO MAKE A FREE THROW.
let ME SHOW YOU HOW THAT'S DONE, OLD MAN.
LEFT-HANDED...
YOU'REST FINE, "Q..."
even IF YOU HAVE TO GO TO A JUNIOR COLLEGE FIRST.
that's WHAT I DID.
Wow. AND LOOK WHERE IT GOT YOU.
let's SEE WHAT YOU GOT.
let's SEE WHAT YOU GOT. COME ON, NATE.
Oh, HERE WE GO.

just DO YOUR BEST.
unlike SOME OF US, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.
Hey, MAN, YOU GOT A SECOND?
just DON'T COME TOO CLOSE RIGHT NOW, MAN.
I'm KIND OF PISSED OFF.
Why? WHAT HAPPENED?
just SOME NONSENSE QUENTIN SAID TO ME.
you KNOW, SOMETIMES THAT KID'S GOT A BIG MOUTH, MAN.
what's UP?
uh, MILLICENT IS GONNA MOVE IN AFTER ALL.

Hey, ABOUT TIME WE CLASSED UP THE PLACE A LITTLE BIT, HUH?
well, SPEAKING OF, YOU THINK WE COULD?

Oh, YOU TALKIN' ABOUT ALL THE SEX TALK
and FOUL LANGUAGE, RIGHT?
Yeah.
good LUCK WITH THAT.
come ON, SKILLS.
I'm NOT SAYING EVERYBODY HAS TO BE A SAINT,
but MILLICENT'S A GIRL, YOU KNOW?
and SHE'S MY GIRL.
all RIGHT. I'LL TALK TO THE FELLAS.
it's ALL GOOD, BABY.
all RIGHT, THANKS.
Hey, YOU THINK SHE COULD WALK AROUND IN HER -- NO.
I DIDN'T THINK SO.
new SONG?
Yeah.

actually, I THINK I'M GONNA RECORD THAT ALBUM WITH PEYTON.
Really? YEAH.
that's GREAT, HALEY.
Yes, IT IS. YEAH.
how'd YOUR WORKOUT GO?
not SO GOOD.
but YOU KNOW WHAT?
whatever HAPPENS, WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.
Yeah, WE WILL.
Hello?
who IS THAT?
that's THE NEW NANNY MAMA HIRED.
did SOMEONE CALL FOR A NANNY?
grandma!
what DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THAT?
grandma DEB IS WAY TOO YOUNG TO BE A GRANDMA.
sorry. NANNY DEB!
Oh, I LIKE THAT SO MUCH BETTER.
Hi, MOM.
Hey, MOM, YOU LOOK GREAT. OOH, THANK YOU.
it's BEEN SAID THAT THE SADDEST THING A MAN WILL EVER FACE IS WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
but WHAT OF THE MAN WHO'S FACED WITH WHAT WAS?
or WHAT MAY NEVER BE?
or WHAT CAN NO LONGER BE?
you DID THE RIGHT THING, SKILLS.
and ONE OF THESE DAYS, "Q" IS GONNA REALIZE THAT.
now WE JUST GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO WIN WITHOUT HIM.
choosing THE RIGHT PATH IS NEVER EASY.
it's A DECISION WE MAKE WITH ONLY OUR HEARTS TO GUIDE US.
but SOMETIMES WE FIND OUR WAY TO SOMETHING BETTER.
Hey, BROOKE, COME ON.
we GOT TO GET TO THE AIRPORT TO PICK UP THAT BABY.
I THINK I NEED TO DO THIS ALONE.
I'm GONNA BE OKAY.
okay.
okay.
sometimes WE FIGHT THROUGH THE REGRET AND REMORSE OF OUR MISTAKES
our MALICE AND OUR JEALOUSY AND THE SHAME WE FEEL FOR NOT BEING THE PEOPLE WE WERE MEANT TO BE.
and THAT'S WHEN WE FIND OUR WAY TO SOMETHING BETTER...
...or WHEN SOMETHING BETTER FINDS ITS WAY TO US.

Oh, yeah, well, that's 'cause I'm in L. A. With lucas.
and we wanted yo uto be the first to know...
we're getting married.
that's great, peyton. I, uh...
I'm just - I'm at the store, and someone needs help.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, okay. Um, you sure everything's okay?
Yeah. I'm just really happyfor you.
I got to go.
Hi. It's brooke.
I know this probably seems out of the blue, but do you think you could meet me at my store?
I thought you were gonna come meet me.
I chickened out.
you're just gonna have to join the mile-high clubon your own.
I just kind of did. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
so, um... when would you like to get married, peyton sawyer?
Oh, I lovethat question. Um... I don't know.
why don't we find a place we both like, and thenwe could pick a date?
okay.
well, until then, how do you feel about living in sin, moving in with me?
well, considering the last 48 hours, I'm pretty sure we already have been living in sin.
Um...yeah. I'd love to.
I do want to spend one more night with brooke, though.
she sounded sad on the phone, and I'm gonna miss her.
you got it.
my god.
Brooke? - Hi.

Yeah.

Hi, boys. - Hey.
Oh, yeah.

Whoo! Yeah, I see. I like that, man.
I wish I had meone of them.

I got you a little something. Hold on one second.
Hey. Dan was at schoolagain today.
it just bothers methat he keeps coming around.
check this out.
now, when I was a kid, I used to put all my littletreasures in here.
see that? Hmm? Now you can, too.
cool! Thanks, q!
Oh, man, it was nothing. You got it.
Q, I'm gonna bein my classroom.

Oh, yeah, it's easy. It's nothing. Yeah. You can do it.
it's a pretty cool gift, huh?
let's see what you got, dr. J.
Yes! Nothing but net.
did you callthe police?
no, and I don't want to.
Brooke, you have to filea police report, or your insurance companywon't accept the claim.
I don't want to. I have plenty of money for this.
well, do you knowwhat's missing?
the computer, cash from the register, and the sketchesfor my new line.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.
but I really thinkwe need to call the police.
no. I don't want the pressinvolved in this.
so you can'ttell anyone, okay?
not haley and nathanor peyton or anyone.
please.
okay.
thank you.
come here.
Deb, you own a gun, right?
I do.
I want you to teach mehow to use it.
jamie was happyto see you at school today.
Haley didn't lookvery pleased, though.
pretty soon, when jamie goes missing, she'll remember thatgrandpa dan kept coming around.
as a matter of fact, she saw his car therepractically every day.
how does it feelto be the prime suspect, huh?
what's on your mind, skills?
Oh, nothing.
actually, when you firststarted dating haley, how hard was thatfor you to keep that from lucas?
it was probably harder for haley 'cause they were friends, but I didn't like lucas.
you didn't likeuncle lucas?
it was a long time ago, big ears.
Why? Where's your head?
just thinking aboutthe rules of it all, you know
how sometimes the heartjust wants what it wants.
so, what's going on, skills?
you sneaking around with some hot girl and not telling us?
Yeah, what's going on, sk-I-ills?
Hey. My ears aren't that big.
well, mr. Fields, you'vecertainly come a long way.
Oh, come on, now. Don't get crazy on me.
you asked me to read the book, and I'm reading the book.
I've also noticed how you are with jamie and nathan. I appreciate it.
I'm telling you, man. Jamie - that kid right there -he is gonna be the man.
I'm serious. He already got some things going for him.
well, I think he likes it that the star of the basketballteam makes him feel special.
well, I gota little brother his age.
Yeah, he always watching me and copying me and whatever. I just
I don't know. I just try to keep it fun for him before he grows upand life gets harder.
Quentin, what do you wantto do with your life? Besides basketball.
besides basketball... I do -t know-I guess, uh...
get married, raise a family.
yeah? You want kids?
I mean, I think about it sometimes.
when I look at my little brother or when I see j luke, I don't know.
I think maybe I'll have a son of my own someday or, you know, a little girl.
that'd be all right. - Yeah.
well, like I said, you've certainly come a long way.
a- plus, mr. Fields.
what? I got a
nice.
so, I guess this means I get to go ahead and stop reading this book?
no.
I - not even -I can'T...
okay, that's good. Just a little lower now.
okay.
Ahh. Perfect.
Hi. - Hi, mama.
what is this? I won't let youhop on the bed, so you're hoppingon the pop?
it's fun. You should try it.
maybe I will.
Hey, um, where's deb? - I have no idea -again.
Hi. - Hey.
um, I-I don't havevery long. - Oh, okay.
sorry. How was your day?
I had to lie to jamieabout us.
then... something elsehappened.
wait. Come on. Sit down.
what's going on?
well, I-I can'treally talk about it, but, um...
I have a friendwho's going through some really emotional stuff.
and she wants meto keep it a secret.
okay.
I'm just not sureI should.
well, how'd you find outabout it?
she called me.
well, without knowingthe situation, I'd say that she called youfor a reason.
and if she ain't really tellnobody else about it, then that meansthat she respects you and probably thinksthat you're the one person that just might understandwhat she going through.
Yeah. That makesa lot of sense.
I mean, is there anythingI can do?
you just did it.
Hey. We just hadour first real conversation.
it was nice. - Yeah, it waskind of nice, huh?
I mean, it wasn't better than that cheerleading outfit, but...
it was nice.
Brooke, I'm home!
okay, don't freak out. - Why?
Oh, my god. Brooke, what happened?
Lindsey came byand said,"peyton's a bitch." And I said,"peyton is not a bitch.
and she said,"yes, she is. " And I said, "well, maybe you're the bitch, bitch."And...
but you should seeher face.
I was doing laundry, and I got all tangled upin one of the sheets, and I fell face-firstdown the stairs.
Oh, honey. I'm sorry I wasn't here. Why didn't you call me?
I did, but you saidyou were getting married.
is that why you soundedso bad on the phone?
Oh, I'm so sorry. - No, it's okay.
really, I'm too sore to hug. - Okay.
but congratulations. - Thanks.
it's kind of sudden, right? - Are you kidding?
the rest of the world'sbeen waiting on you two idiotssince high school.
he asked meto move in with him. - Really?
do married people do that?
I really am happy for you, P.Sawyer.
I might bea little happierif it was your bony ass that fell down the stairs, but still...
I'm gonna miss this. - Me too.
I smell a little monstersneaking up behind me
what's up, beastie boy?
can you help memake a cape? - Sure. How come?
well, quentin really likes mine, and I thought maybe we couldmake one for him, too.
I thinkthat's a very nice idea.
I'd be happyto help you, sir.
do you smell that?
no. - I-I smella bigger monster.
uncle lucas!
you're gettingting heavy.
did you know thatdaddy didn't like you once?
what? When?
when he was dating mama. I have big ears.
good looking out.
kid's got my back.
so, speakiso, speaking ofsneaking around, uh, where have you beenthe last few days?
with peyton, maybe?
actually, we're engaged.
get out!
dude, I justshaved your head from your last engagement gone wrong!
I know. I know it sounds crazy.
but we just spent the lastcouple of days together, happier than either one of uscan remember.
and I know I have beenall over the place.
but my best friend told me,"pick a team." And you were right.
you're happy? - We both are.
that's all that counts.
besides, the only people that tear happy people down are those that are unhappy, so you go do your thing. I got your back.
Thanks.
thank you.
for what?
for always helping me, for giving me a place to live and for the record labeland...
for beingmy best friend.
you really are a good person, brooke davis.
and what do iget out of it?
great friends... great life...good karma.
I don't believe in karma.
I try to be a good person, and bad stuff happens anyway.
like what kindof bad stuff?
like fallingdown the stairs?
Yeah, something like that.
you missing...?
I don't really wantto talk about it.
okay.
well, let meask you something.
if you don'tbelieve in karma... what do you believe in?
justice.
I'm not sureI'll see you again make sure we make it bigger, mama.
q's a li-I-ttle biggerthan me. - A little?
you thinknanny deb wants help?
Oh, I think nanny deb'staking a nap right now.
she sure has been tireda lot lately. - Yeah, she has, huh?
where did I putmy scissors?
Hey. Masked avenger, get up. - What?
I knowwhat you've been up to.
I was gonna tell you.
Deb, I will not have a junkiearound my son.
Oh, wait. What?
I found the pills.
O...kay.
come on, deb. Nathan's pain medication for his back.
this bottle was fulla week ago, and now you're out all nightand you're always tired.
you thinkI took those pills?
well, unless you've been fighting crime in that thing, where the hellhave you been?
I've been having sex.
well, I have. And I haven't taken a single one of those pills.
I believeyour husband's back has been bothering him lately.
we know whatyou've been up to, nathan.
and don'ttry and blame it on deb, because she has beenhaving sex.
have you been takingthese pills? And don't say... - yes.
Yes. Yes? - Yeah.
those are my pain pillsfor my back, and my back'sbeen in pain.
this bottle was fulla week ago. - I know.
I've been takingtwo a day, which iswhat the prescription says.
but - - you know, contrary to popular belief, some people can take pills without turning into a junkie.
I'm going back to bed.
look, if it makes youfeel any better, I could probably playthrough the pain, but those pillsreally seem to help.
I just want youto be careful. - I will.
are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.
can we at leastjust go see the doctor and talk to him about everything now that you're playing again?
sure. We'll go tomorrow.
okay.
you know what the worst part about being a fugitive is?
being a fugitive.
all that sneaking around, constantly being pursued.
see, that's where you come in.
grandpa dan, just out of prison, hanging aroundthe schoolyard, and then jamie's missingand grandpa dan's missing.
I'm sure the manhunt will be extensive, but they'll be looking for youin a black S. U.V.
not in a shallow graveout by the swing set.
you knowwhat I love most?
the fact thatno one checks up on you because no one likes you.
Yeah, they'll all miss jamie, but no one's gonna miss you.
all I have to do isburn your I. D. And that pager.
and, by the way, a beeper - what are you, a drug dealeron "miami vice"?
you did get one page, though - right after I hit youwith that car.
so I guess your table's ready at the cheesecake factory.
it's alive!
well done.
what does it want to say?
your plan sucks.
you know, that pain you're experiencingis your bodytelling you to slow down.
you can't handle the paceyou kept before your accident.
which is not to say you can'thave a basketball career again, if you're smart about it.
what does that mean, exactly?
can you tell us the risks to himif he plays again?
well, it's the "exactly" partthat's a little tricky, haley.
Nathan's backis held togetherwith medical ingenuityand a few miracles.
the miracle partisn't exactly scientific.
but it's possible thatI could play for 10 yearsand be fine, right?
Oh, yeah, it's possible.
but here'sthe worst-case scenario.
you cause your spineenough traumato end up back in that wheelchair
possibly for life.
how comepeyton's moving out?
because she's moving inwith me.
we're getting married.
what happenedto lindsey?
it's a long story, kid.
what do you mean? Like love love?
no, we were always, uh, just friends.
Why?
just wondered.
were you ever in lovewith aunt brooke?
long story.
here.
make yourself useful, knucklehead.
when you get married, do I have to bethe ring bearer again?
not if you don't want to.
good.'cause last time, it didn't work out so well.
your plan sucks.
Really?
the guy can finally speak, andhe's a frickin' talking parrot.
don't make meget the ball gag.
now you're justturning me on.
okay.
I'll play your little game, parrot.
why does my plan suck?
the pager.
there's a numberon the back of it.
call it.
is this a trick?
call it and find out.
my plan doesn't suck.
they're getting married, huh?
Yeah.
the doctor scared you, didn't he?
right about the timehe said "paralysis.
I was watching you practicewith the team yesterday.
you looked so happy
somebody that was doing exactlywhat they were born to do.
you still love it, don't you?
Yeah.
I do.
and the truth is, I could probably slow downand try to playa little differently.
no, you can'T. That's not who you are.
you can't do that.
can I tell youa secret, though?
that's what I loveabout you.
I remember the first timeI saw you playwhen I was tutoring you.
you were like a rock starout there.
Masonboro.
you sat with keith, and you wore that goofy hat.
whatever.
I scored 35 pointsthat night, and each basketwas like my own personal versionof a haley jamespickup line.
it worked.
I played that game for you, haley, and you know what?
I'd give it upfor you, too.
cause as much as I loveplaying the gameand the person that I amwhen I play it,
I love being a husbandand a father more.
this isthe last of it.
no brooke? -No.
she was gonewhen I woke up this morning, and she's not picking upher cell or at the store.
that sucks. I really wanted to see her.
a little help here.
I got you.
Hey, peyton.
it's a beginning, not an end.
stop smiling!
call the number.
call the number, call the number"!
you want me to call the number?
I'll call the damn number!
pay as you go. No caller I. D.
my "plan sucks," saysthe cripple in the restraints.
Emergencymedical response team.
may I have your name and thenumber on your pager, please?
I-I'm sorry. I thinkI've dialed the wrong number.
who is this?
Emergencymedical response team.
and unless you're on the waitinglist for a heart transplant, you've calledthe wrong number.
I'm sorry.
shut up.
I said,"shut up!
it's deb, honey.
Hi.
I wasin the neighborhood.
thought you might want to havea little girls' night.
no, thank you.
I lived a lot of yearsfeeling powerless and alone.
I was pissed off and medicatedand scared to death.
that's not going to happento you -- not if I can help it.
now, get dressed.
what does that mean --emergency response team?
speak!
it means...
I have less than six monthsto live.
and even if I kidnapmy own grandson, then I'm only a suspectfor a few months.
then I'm dead.
and where is he?
which meansyour plan sucks.
stop saying that!
you hear me?
stop saying that, and keep your mouth shut, or I promise youI will kill you right now!
without that heart...
I'm already dead.
this is brooke. And this is peyton. Leave us -- call us
you said I was supposed to go next.
noNo, I did not. -Yes, you did!
leave a message. Bye.
I told you I was gonna go next.
damn.
one more, man. Let's go.
that's it. I'm done today, man.
what?
that's soft, man.
you ain't never gettingto the association like that.
all right, we'll see about that.
so, you're leaving?
just like that?
what the hellare you thinking about, nate?
I'm thinkingI got a really hot wifeand an awesome sonwaiting for me at home.
Hey, nate.
I'm happy to bea part of it, man.
what's that?
the comeback.
don't call ita comeback, man.
Oh, it's a comeback, baby.
it's a beautiful thingto watch, bro.
tomorrow morning --rivercourt.
and, Q...
thank you.
it's so awesome, mama.
Quentin's gonna love it.
don't you have the apartmentall to yourself now?
Where's the party?
Yeah, well, you gota whole house all to yourself.
not anymore.
Peyton's moving in. We're getting married.
well, well.
you want another drink, or should I just waittill you propose to brooke?
nice.
how aboutI buy you a drink, huh?
I mean, unless it's a bad time.
Nah.
I was just gonnatalk to q about something.
but I'll see him tomorrow.
all right. Let's go.
let's roll.
can I get 20on pump number 1, please?
have a nice night.
Hello?
Oh, my god.
Lucas, what is it?
Quentin fields was shot tonight.
he's dead.
I wish.
I couldtake this pain away.
but I can'T.
and I'm sorry.
Quentin was my brother.
Quentin was my friend.
I've been seeing antwon, and he needs me now.
what are you doing?! Hey!
shoplift much?
get off me, bitch!
Hey!
there was a therapistthat nathan and I went to.
I can give you her number if you want.
okay.
get your filthy, murdering handsaway from my son!
you need to quit that weak-ass fadeaway.
huh? You want some cuddling?
is that what you want?
go home.
crawl back in bed with your wife.
that's weak, nate.
the road to the nba goes through me, boy.
come on!
the hardest part of saying goodbye.
is having to do it again every single day.
well, well.
the prodigal coach returns.
every day, we face the same truth
that life is fleeting.
it's cool, coach taylor.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
that our time here is short.
and to honor the fallen.
we must live our own lives well.
what does it say, mama?
you will soar on wings like eagles.
you will run and not grow weary.
do you think there's basketball in heaven?
I know there is.
how long has it been?
eight days.
I miss him.
come on.
good morning, honey.
at least you're making noise.
maybe next week I'll get a "hello.
mom. you told me you were screwing one of my friends at a funeral.
I figured that meant you didn't really want to talk.
okay.
I should have told you about my relationship with antwon before, but we've got to find a way to deal with this, honey.
how can I live here if you're not gonna talk to me?
I was thinking the same thing.
I thought I could get used to it.
I haven'T.
and I can'T.
you're kicking me out?
say hi to antwon for me.
mama! It's grandpa dan.
he's dead!
no, buddy, he's not.
this is not what it looks like.
but you and daddy said the people in the cemetery are in heaven, like quentin.
right, but, uh, some people like to buy their headstones before they die -- like way before.
um, like the backpack that we got you the week before school started.
it's like that. Grandpa dan's just. being prepared.
to die in a week? - No.
he's -- he's alive.
grandpa dan is alive, I promise.
then can we go see him?
is that - yeah. Mick wolf.
are you serious?
what is he doing here?
recording, I guess.
Hi.
uh, I hope you don't mind. You know, I see an empty studioand a guitar going to waste.
it's just an old habit.
no, no, it's cool.
um, actually, it's an honor. I'm a huge fan.
I even have a couple of albumsyou played on up on the wall in my office.
well, I'm the onewho's honored.
you're not supposed to bein my town, let alonemy recording studio.
so, why are you here?
my store was robbed, and I was attacked.
I see.
victims of violenceoften find it helpful to talk through the experiencein therapy.
it helps them make senseof a random act.
this wasn't random.
nothing my mother doesis random.
so, which one's yours?
uh, mine's not here today.
right. I think I've seen youwith him before -- the little blond-hred, blue-eyed cutie.
actually, I'm his, uh.
I'm his nanny.
a least I wasuntil I got fired.
been there. Believe me.
people don't realize how immensely important it isto be a nanny.
and they never appreciatetrue devotion.
it's enoughto drive you crazy.
well, in my case, my son didn't appreciatewho I was sleeping with.
Yeah, they get so touchyabout that stuff.
the heart wantswhat it wants. - Yeah.
but then again, if it were me.
I would do whatever it takes to stayin that little boy's life.
was there a history of abusein your family?
growing up, I mean.
not unless you considera high credit-card limit and no supervision abuse.
yet you thinkyour mother attacked you.
I don't thinkvictoria did it personally.
I think she hired some flying monkeyto do her dirty work.
it must be hard for youto believe.
what mattersis that you believe it.
see, she knewthat I had just finished those sketchesfor my fall line, she knew I was keeping themat the store, and she knewthat if I showed up to my board meetingwithout them,
I would look incompetent.
and that's all she needsto convince the board to give her controlof my company.
it sounds shakespearean.
you probably thinkI'm crazy.
no, I don'T.
I think we havea lot to talk about.
how should I start, at the beginningor just from when I fired her?
you you fired your mom?
it'll be fine.
I can pick up the slack.
besides, nanny deb was awolmost of the time, anyway.
Yeah. You know, it's funny. All these years, wecalled him "skills.
I always thought it hadsomething to do with basketball.
that's not funny.
kind of funny.
come on, nate.
I.Andy wasn't much older than mewhen he started dating my mom, and, I mean, look how wellthat turned out.
well, andy wasn't one of your classmates oryour supposed friends, and he wasn't seeing karenbehind your back.
you got to get over thisby tomorrow night's game.
Oh, I will, but I'll do it for Q Not for skills.
I'm really upsetwith that guy.
I know you are, but the teamneeds you and so will jamie.
and the way I see it, skills will be a better fatherthan dan ever was.
this iswhere grandpa dan lives?
Yeah, not bad, huh?
I think you shouldlet him babysit.
how come grandpaisn't picking up his papers?
I don't know, buddy.
maybe he doesn't likewhat's in it.
Yeah, you're probably right.
I don't thinkhe's home, bud.
Hey, will you waitin the car for me?
but I want to seegrandpa dan.
I know, buddy. I just need a second.
okay. Okay.
okay, dan, please don't berotting on the floor.
Hi. - Hey.
there's my baby girl.
so, what do you saywe go out tonight?
I mean, after all the sneaking around, I just want to be ableto show my girl off.
ANTWON. - hmm?
Nathan kicked me outof the house.
Wow. I knew natewas mad, but that's messed up.
look, I'm sorry.
why don't you just stay herefor a while?
mouth's gone. Plus, you've bn herelike every night, anyway.
it's not that easy.
I've worked really hard to get back into my son's lifeand jamie'S.
I can't compromise that now.
Uh-oh. I don't likewhere this is heading.
I think we have toface facts.
I mean, even if nathansomehow got over this, what would your parents say?
well, my lastserious girlfriend was bevin.
so I'm sure they'll saythis is a step up.
I'm almost 20 years olderthan you.
Yeah, but you're only as oldas you feel.
and you feeljust right to me.
you're so sweet.
and I really like you.
but I'm sorry.
for the sake of my family, I think we have toend this.
you ever look backon all of it and just feel really fortunateto have been a part of it?
Yeah, I suppose so.
it's just I don't look backthat much.
God, you were right there!
I mean, you wereat the center of everything and making history and giving ussomething to believe in.
didn't rolling stonecall you "the reluctant conscienceof rock"?
Yeah. Rolling stone also called mea cult favorite, which is their way of sayingyou don't sell any records.
is that why you stoppedrecording?
I mean, your own stuff.
no. I stopped recordingmy own stuff 'cause I didn't feel like I hadanything left worth saying.
you know, session workpays pretty good. You work a couple of weeksout of the month.
the rest of the timeis your own.
yeah?
how about you let me fill up some of thatfree time with lunch?
I know a really good placedown by the water, and I kind of havea lot of questions.
what's the matter?
you look likeyou've seen a ghost.
I feel like I have. That's your mom's jacket.
you look just like her.
well, mia told meshe met someone on tour who knew ellie, but how could she not sayit was mick wolf?
Mia's a good kid. She's a good singer, but she's way too youngto know who the hell I am.
how'd you know who i was?
when your mom got sick, it hit all of us hard --everyone who knew her.
somewhere along the line, someone gave methat benefit cd you made, and read what you said about her in the liner notes, which was which was beautiful.
so I guess you could say I'm a fan of yours, too.
did you know my dad?
no.
I don't think anyonereally knew your dad.
Hi. I'm looking for dr. Thornton.
it's about dan scott, my, uh.
my father-in-law.
and I was wondering if you couldjust have the doctor call me.
okay. Thank you.
Hey, skills. Are you okay?
Nate ain't here, is he?
no, you're safe.
but you look, uh, not so great.
Deb broke up with me.
well, I guess you can tusslewith a cougar, but you're gonna get bit.
why everybody thinkit's a big joke?
Deb's just done a lotof wacky things in her life.
we never thoughtyou'd be one of them.
look, I know it sounds crazy, but I really have feelingsfor her.
Really?
well, all right. Well, let's, uh.
let's be realisticabout this.
how many good yearsdo you think deb has left?
fine, laugh all you want. I just thought maybe you couldtalk to nate for me.
Oh, no. I don't want to gettin the middle of this. No, thank you.
come on, haley.
you know we always hadeach other's backs.
I'll see what I can do.
maybe you should just man upand talk to nathan yourself.
I notice you call your mother"victoria.
she insisted after we wentinto business together.
why did you go into businesswith her?
I don't know.
maybe I wanted herto love me.
is that something you still want?
I bought a gun.
that's not uncommonfor attack victims.
it gives them a feelingof control.
unless you're having thoughtsof hurting your mother.
no.
I mean, I'm not crazy.
but it occurs to me that.
it wouldn't bother meif she were dead.
and that can't be healthy, right?
to feel likeif your mother was dead, you would't miss her, that you might be betterfor it.
and I just don't knowhow it got to this.
maybe you should ask your motherthat question.
antwon came to see me today, and he said that deb broke up with him.
he's pretty upset.
good.
he shouldn't have beensleeping with my mom.
said theanwho slept with my sister.
I remember the first time I saw you. I was sittingat the geek table, and you were sitting over thereat the jock table, and if we had playedby the rules of high school, we wouldn't be sitting hereat this table.
okay, all right, I get it.
you and I weren't the mostconventional couple, either.
are you ever gonna stop tryingto make me into a better personal it's not likely.
speaking of exiled parents, did you know that dn alreadyhas a headstone at the emetery?
it makes keith's stonelook tiny by comparison.
leave it to dan scott to get into a pissing contestwith keith even after he's dead.
Yeah, well, jamie saw it, and he freaked out and insisted on seeing dan.
I didn't knowwhat else to do.
I-I took himover to the beach house.
Haley - I'm sorry.
Dan wasn't home, though.
in fact, it looked like hehadn't been home in a few days.
when was the last timeyou saw him?
I don't know. A few weeks ago?
he's playingmind games again.
I basically told himto go off and die.
well, I'm worriedabout jamie.
he's -- he's still trying to getover the death of quentin, and now dan's disappeared.
I know we didn't want himaround, but jamie did.
it feels kind of selfish.
well, rememberwho we're talking about.
Yeah.
Hey, andre.
how have you been? - So-so.
yeah? Have you been playingbasketball?
a little.
do you thinkI could be a raven someday?
mama says I'm gonna beas tall as quentin.
at least 9 feet.
well, I bet you will.
why don't you come see me in about 10 years, all right?
a little early to be recruiting, isn't it?
Hi, coach.
why don't you come on in?
get off me!
enough! Okay?
I'm gonna seeevery one of you in detention.
hold on.
Hey, are you okay?
congratulations on your firsttree hill catfight. I've had a few in my day.
spare methe female bonding, okay?
I may be new, but I've heardall about mrs. James-scott, a cheerleader who datedthe star of the basketball team.
that is, when you weren'ton a rock tour.
your life must have beenreally tough.
so just don't pretendlike you know anything about my problems, okay?
see you in detention, hannah montana.
Hey, I foundyour shoplifter.
I knew it.
that little street urchindoes go to tree hill high.
thank you.
she's justa messed-up kid.
she's a messed-up kidtaking growth hormones.
she knocked meflat on my ass.
she just transferred here.
I think she was probablyjust looking for a way to impress kidswith some new clothes, you know?
I'll give her pointsfor having good taste.
just try and keep her awayfrom my store.
Hey! James lucas scott, step away from the mannequin before I come over there and pluck out your eyells.
did I just soundlike a total bitch?
Yes. And you also sounded like a mom -- a good one.
Oh, he usually makes itso easy.
hmm. And what happenswhen he doesn't?
he's still the most loved kidin the world.
okay? - Yeah.
I just wish I had had a family like yours.
you do. You're aunt brooke.
you okay? - Yeah.
Yeah. I just -- you know, ellie never really told me a lot about my father.
and I guess she didn't want meto know much.
I don't know.
and so I was just hopingyou could -- I don't know.
I knew him a little.
um. ellie loved him.
and he loved her right back.
and their romance was oneof the all-time greats.
which meant it was messy.
but, uh. we shouldall be that lucky, right?
to be so passionate about someone.
Yeah. Oh, oh, which reminds me.
um, god, my fiancis gonna kill me if I let you leave townwithout meeting him.
you don't like basketballby any chance, do you?
Bobcats? - Ravens.
microwave soup?
what's the problem?
nanny deb always makes mesliders on game days.
Oh, she does, huh?
with two picklesfor good luck.
well, daddy nathanmakes you soup.
when is she coming back?
I don't know, buddy.
is it becauseshe was kissing uncle skills?
you knew about that? - Yeah.
they tried to pretend he was getting somethingout of her eye, but they were just being all mushy.
Yeah. And how does it feel to be scarred for life?
fine. I like nanny deb.
I like uncle skills.
so what if they likeeach other?
it's a little more complicatedthan that.
your nanny deb is also my mom.
Yeah. But I let you kiss my mom.
eat your soup.
as you all know, tonight's basketball gameis dedicated to quentin, and I think it would be great if you could all be there, so no homework.
but don't worry. We'll make itup next week, though. I promise.
Sam. stick around. I want to talk to you.
um. I read your paperthat you wrote on quentin.
it was very good, and I think you should spendsome more time writing.
and maybe a little less timeshoplifting.
I don't knowwhat you're talking about.
relax.
one of my best friends, brooke, owns clothes over bros, and she's not gonnapress charges.
actually, she sent you a gift.
you know, I'm not homeless, okay?
tell your friendI don't need her charity.
Sam. I don't knowwhat you're going through.
I don't know anythingabout your life.
but if you want to talk, I am here to listen.
great.
why don't you guyshead to the locker room?
come on. We got a game tonight.
Hey, nate, can we talk?
Hey, grandpa.
look, I'm hereto support the team, skills.
I don't really have anythingto say to you.
then don'T. Just listen.
I know me and deb together sounds likesome freaky porn thing, and maybe it startedthat way.
this isn't helping.
but the thing is.
your mom makes me happy.
and I thinkI make her happy, too.
I can't believe we're evenhaving this conversation.
look, neither one of uswants to do anything that's gonna mess things upfor you.
it's a little latefor that.
okay, you're right.
I should have told you abouteverything from the beginning.
but I reallycare for her, nate.
look, I'll just leave the ballin your court.
all right, look, I know you don't feel muchlike playing basketball tonight.
and I get it.
when I was in high school, someone close to mewas taken away.
and I-I couldn't understand how a gamecould matter anymore.
but my coach was a wise man, and he told me that basketballwas more than just a game, that it had the powerto heal me if I let it.
he was right.
now there's someone elseI'd like you to hear from.
Hi, guys.
this last weekhas been hard on all of us.
but what gets me through is trying to rememberthe happy times with quentin.
and lord knows that boywas never happier than when he was holdinga basketball.
now, coach says that, um, some of you might be feelinga little guilty about playing tonight.
well, let me tell youone thing that I know.
Quentin would want youto play tonight.
play your hearts out.
and if you don'T.
well, andre here -- I think he's gonna go outand play for you.
right, baby?
and one more thing.
don't feel like you're moving onwithout quentin because he's gonna be with youon that court.
I'm sure of that.
so am I.
and he's gonna be right here right by your heart.
so. who wants to carry him outonto that court?
every day, we facethe same truth, that our time here is short.
and to honor the fallen, we must liveour own lives well.
we must take the high roadwhen we can and allow our common loss to bring us together.
I think that's the way Q. Would have wanted it.
and while tonight we miss our fallen teammate.
friend.
loved one.
we commemorate him for all time.
no raven will ever wear the number 44 again.
and for as longas this gym stands, quentin fields.
will be here with us.
no one can take his placeon this team.
and no one.
can take his placein our hearts.
moment silence for Number 44, quentin fields.
Hi, chester. Long time, no see.
I just need.
a few of jamie's thingsfor our little road trip, just enoughto make him comfortable.
these peopleare so lost without me.
it's a good thingyou can't talk, chester.
otherwise, you'd be my dinner tonight.
Mmm. Tasty.
Hello, victoria.
what are you doingin new york?
let's go. Bring it in.
come on, ravens!
come on, now!
this might be the greatest lossI'll ever see.
well, sometimesit's not about winning.
sometimes it's about healing.
now's your chance.
the gun's loaded. Just aim low.
I'd like to look goodat my funeral.
what is the matterwith you?
what -- what happenedto your eyes?
as if you don'talready know.
all I know is that my daughtershows up at my doorstep with a gun.
all I know is my motherhad me attacked in my store.
Oh, my god. Brooke.
are you sayingit wasn't you?
did you go to the police?
does anyone elseknow about this?
don't worry.
you've trained me very well.
I put the company first.
it's just the publicity.
this from the woman who saidshe could spin it favorably if I had a drug problem.
I want you to answermy question.
you want an answer?
here's one.
I would neverphysically harm you.
well, maybe you didn'tmean to.
it was late. You thought millicentwould be there. You hate her.
you are so paranoid --and wrong.
someone died last week.
and I wasn't close to him, but my friends were, and yet, in the midstof all their grief, I felt nothing.
I just felt cold.
and I realized I'm turninginto the one person I do not want to become.
I'm turning into you.
what do you want meto say, brooke?
that I was a failureas a mother?
you got everythingyou wanted.
except your love.
when I was your age, I dreamed of havinga clothing line, of having a business.
of all the thingsyou have.
but I stupidly fell in love.
and one morning, your father and igot a little surprise.
I told himI didn't want kids.
it was never the plan.
but he wanted a sonmore than anything.
and as soon as I got fat, he had an excuse to jump intoany bed he wanted.
and when we hadour little baby girl, I made sure I would neverbe pregnant again.
if I couldn't have my dream, your fathercouldn't have his, either.
I probably took it out on youa little too much along the way, but you know what?
you should be thanking mefor giving you life. Do you understand that?
I do thank you.
because now I knowit wasn't my fault.
it was never my fault.
I'm calling the lawyerstomorrow, and I'm divesting my interestsin clothes over bros
the magazine, the line.
you can have everything.
congratulations, victoria.
now you have a companyand no daughter.
you got your dream.
years from now, the record bookswill show that.
the ravens lost to the wildcatson this night.
but here's somethingthat those records won't show, something that.
no one in that gymwill ever forget.
that the four-man ravens made the wildcats fight and scratch and claw for every single secondof that win.
and in doing so, they showed that a team will always be more importantthan statistics.
when your grandkids ask you about this game, you tell them that you played hard.
for quentin fields.
that you stood tall.
and you did itto honor your friend.
you shouldbe proud of yourselves, men.
I know I'm proud of you.
coach.
we want to play with fourthe rest of the season.
that's gonna be hardon all of you.
we want to do it for Q.
he's our fifth.
it's been an honorcoaching you guys.
so, are you sure you don'twant to stay and meet lucas?
another time.
I think I'm gonna stay aroundfor a little while, do some recording.
Oh. It just so happensI have an empty studio.
Really?
I thought you said you didn'thave anything left worth saying.
maybe one more thing.
okay, mick.
when mia said that there wassomebody asking about me who knew ellie.
I thought maybe. you were my father.
that would be something, wouldn't it?
I'll see you later.
where to? - The airport.
I'm going home to my family.
see you soon, baby.
mom. I want youto move back in.
Jamie's been througha lot lately.
he needs his nanny deb.
thank you.
he really makes you happy?
he does.
but you've had to sacrificeso much for me over the years, nathan.
I just don't want to see it.
okay, I don't want to hear about it.
but whatever you want.
hey hello?
Yeah, this is haley.
Really?
uh, okay. Yeah. Thank you for calling.
you too.
what's wrong?
uh. that was dan's doctor.
apparently, they had a heart for him and he neveranswered their call.
then he really hasgone off to die.
Hey, nate.
I know Q. Was working with youto get your game back.
what were you working on?
he always saidI couldn't go left.
so maybe that'swhere we start.
Mick Wolf. You look like you've seen a ghost.
I feel like I have. That's your mom's jacket.
you look just like her.
one of my best friends, Brooke, owns clothes over bros, and she sent you a gift.
my store was robbed, and I was attacked.
I'm calling the lawyers tomorrow, and I'm divesting my interests in clothes over bros.
now you have a company and no daughter.
Whoa!
I'm gonna do this.
Hey, daddy, when you play in the NBA, you should play for the bobcats.
I'm sorry, Lucas. I can't marry you.
I love you. - Yes.
you didn't let me ask you.
Yes, baby, yes.
mama!
it's grandpa dan! He's dead!
no, buddy. He's alive.
grandpa dan is alive, I promise.
then can we go see him?
I am going to kill you.
but first, I'm gonna get Jamie back.
and you're gonna help me.
they say we leave this world just the way we came into it naked and alone.
so, if we do leave with nothing, what, then, is the measure of a life?
is it defined by the people we choose to love?
or is life simply measured by our accomplishments?
and what if we fail?
or are never truly loved?
what then?
can we ever measure up?
or will the quiet desperation of a life gone wanting drive us mad?
morning.
Hi.
so, I heard from the church, and we have a date!
I marked it on the calendar.
that was quick.
that's good. That's great.
is that okay?
you do still want to get married, right?
Yes.
right here, right now.
then, what?
well, you know how I have to take the shuttle today to new york for my book-launch meeting?
Yeah. So?
well, it's just...
I haven't exactly told Lindsey about us...
or the wedding.
I know. I should have told her about it by now, but...
that's just not something I can do over the phone.
there you are!
Lucas and I set a date this morning, so I have to ask you a really big favor.
okay.
if it's about money, it's probably not the best time.
Oh, God, stop it!
I need a dress!
and if it helps,
I promise to pay full price.
is my best friend down?
sure.
do you want the Lindsey Strauss tear-away train?
it's what all the runaway brides are gonna be wearing this season.
so not funny.
no, I was thinking something like non-traditional, you know?
like rocker-glam-chic, kind of like, um...
Stephanie Seymour dress she wears in the guns n'roses video.
skanky.
I can do that.
who peed in your cheerios?
I just had a thing with Victoria.
I don't mean to take it out on you.
for the record, it is very nice to see you so happy.
thank you.
everything is going really good, you know?
it just
it feels right with Lucas, and the label's taking off.
I have a music legend in my studio right now.
who?
cool?
you are so musically challenged.
I guarantee you, you have like 30 songs on your ipod that he's played on.
and...he knew Ellie.
so it's like this window into a world that I've never gotten to see.
I mean, you can not imagine what it's like to finally find out what your mother was like when she was young.
maybe a little.
Brooke, what happened with Victoria?
nothing.
it's not important. I'm fine.
let's get to work on the dress, huh?
Scott residence.
Yeah, this is him.
Yes, sir.
uh, yes, sir. I could be there today, if you want.
Absolutely.
I'm -- I'm looking forward to it, too. Thank you.
everything okay?
that was the general manager for the fort wayne D-league team.
the D-league?
basketball, mama!
it's just a developmental league team, but the G. M.Wants to meet with me today.
Ohh!
that was the NBA calling.
I told you! You're gonna play in the NBA!
my god, baby! Ohh!
daddy, I'm so proud of you!
today is the day Dan Scott dies...
and I get my Jamie back.
need to makesome returns.
are you kidding?
those were gifts.
you have a lot of nerve even setting foot in this store.
last time I checked, it's okay to return gift items.
we not okay.
just like it's not okay to steal.
I didn't steal from you.
you didn't give me a chance to pay.
I didn't give youa chance to pay?
when exactly were you planning on paying me?
was it after you assaulted meand called me a bitch or maybe after you ran your thieving little street-urchinass down the block?
um, excuse me. Can I help you?
Yeah, you can.
I got a work order here to box up all your remaining store inventory for shipment to New York.
what? Says who?
swell.
it's your lucky day.
victoria Davis, the new president of clothes over bros, will be happy to give you a full cash refund.
all righty.
is that a Les Paul?
uh, close.
it's a --it's an aristocrat.
imagine if that guitar could talk, the stories it would tell.
Oh, I don't know.
this baby's been around some pretty crazy stuff.
it's probably best that she doesn't speak.
was it around when my dad fell in love with Ellie?
Yeah. It was.
so, what, was it, like, love at first sight or what?
pretty much.
I mean, they met on tour, and...
I don't remember which one it was, but I remember that she fell for your dad instantly.
what about him?
did he like her right away?
well...you know, they tried to play it cool, like it wasn't a big deal.
but it was.
I mean, everybody knew that they were just meant to be together.
um, I should probably let you get back to work, huh?
Yeah. Right.
I'm just gonna be right out here if you need anything.
right. Yeah.
great to meet you. How was your flight?
Oh, it was good, sir. Thanks so much for having me.
it's Bobby.
Hey, I really appreciate you coming up here short notice, but I wanted you to have a good look at the facility before we really get into things.
as you'll see, everything here is state-of-the-art.
the owners have sparedno expense.
I see that, sir.
it's just "Bobby."Just "Bobby.
come on. Let me show you around.
make no mistake. We want to win here.
we've got some good player son our squad, some of whom you'll meet today.
I know that with the right coaching, we can send some of themto the NBA next season.
and all that begins right here.
so, Nathan, how does it feel to be in a real gym again?
good. It feels good.
I bet it does.
come on.
mom, the phone's for you.
Yes, hello?
Yes, that's my son.
Yeah, he's very cute. Who I
I'm -- I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
hospice?
come here, babe.
Yeah. Just a second.
Yes. I understand. Thank you.
and I'm so looking forward to making your acquaintance.
and, of course, meeting your charming son.
looks like my "sucky" plan is going to be a smashing success.
so, what would it like for its last meal?
Haley? You okay?
Nathan was right all along.
Dan...really has gone off to die.
what do you mean?
I just got a phone call from his hospice nurse.
she thinks it's only a matter of hours now.
I'm so sorry, Deb.
Oh. Oh, please.
it's just...
it doesn't sound like Dan.
what do you mean?
well, I would have expected a little more grandstanding, that's all.
well, she say she's asking for Jamie.
thinks I should bring him by.
do you think Jamie should see him like that?
I don't know.
after everything he's been through with Quentin and now seeing Dan's gravestone, I promised him he could see his grandfather.
so, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Oh, I wish Nathan were here.
you're here.
Hey.
so, how was your flight? You ready for today?
Yeah, um...it -- it was fine.
listen, there's something
I really need to talk to you about. It's important.
and I probably should have talked to you about it a while ago, but
look, I don't want this to be awkward for either of us, all right?
we have to work together, so let's not dothe heavy emotional thing.
I'll be okay if you're okay. Okay?
wait till you see what we have planned for you today.
it's gonna be great.
starting with this.
so, what do you think?
I think it looks amazing.
so, these are your all-time favorites?
um, some of them.
some of them just look really cool.
hmm.
okay, five albums...
five that you couldn't live without if you were stranded on a desert island.
Really?
show me a person's favorite records, and I'll tell you everything you need to know about them.
okay. Fine.
but you're gonna have to write yours down, too.
okay. It's a deal.
I caught a young girl shop lifting the other day.
I was pretty hard on her.
did you feel threatened by her?
no.
no, I actually felt myself feeling jealous.
jealous?
I realize I let the company matter too much.
you know, we spend all this time building something up, and then we don't enjoy it.
we just sit there, terrified that someone's gonna take it away from us.
and there was this girl, and she didn't answer to anything or anyone.
and...that made me jealous.
what are you going to do about that, with regards to your company?
well, it doesn't matter.
I don't have to worry about clothes over bros anymore.
and why's that?
I gave it all away.
I signed the company over to Victoria.
do you regret that?
so, you liking what you're seeing so far?
are you kidding me? It's great.
I got to say, this came out of nowhere.
I'm really, really grateful you called.
no, no. Pleasure's all mine.
I got to tell you, I've had my eye on you for a while.
I watched you win those two championships at Gilmore.
I saw you play at Maryland.
well, thank you, but I'm more interested in the future.
good. I'm glad to hear you say that.
cause we could really use a good, young coach like you.
y-you want me to coach?
no, no. I thought you wanted me to play.
well, Nathan, your playing days are over.
come on. You must know that.
Oh, that is so predictable.
Whoa! Whoa! That's cheating.
that's like two albums, really.
okay, fine.
number two --"never mind,
and not just because you played on it.
exile on main street,"and that "never mind" thing is a rumor.
supposedly.
okay, so that leaves number one. What do you got?
Oh, that's easy.
it is the first record I ever bought
Elvis Costello,"my aim is true.
what?
Hey, why do you think, in all this time, my dad has never reached out to me?
I'm not sure I can answer that
at least not in a way that's gonna make you happy.
why'd they give me up?
Peyton, we, um...
I-I mean, all of us were really screwed up then.
you know, Ellie never planned for you, and you got to understand that it just never would have worked.
Hey, I was wondering, um...
if maybe you wanted to come by tonight.
cause, hopefully, Lucas will get home early, and I know he would really like to meet you.
and I just...
I was hoping you could tell meall about my parents.
I want to know about my dad.
be careful what you wish for.
please.
okay.
be there.
Hey, it's Nate. Leave it.
Nathan, hi, I'm really sorry to bug you up there, but, uh...it's about Dan.
I need to talk to you.
I got a phone call from his hospice nurse this morning, and it's not good.
you should call me.
I love you. Bye.
what's a hospice?
is something wrong with grandpa?
you said he was okay.
I did. I know I did.
it turns out grandpa's really sick.
but he's gonna get better, right?
come here.
sometimes people get so sick that they can't get better.
is he gonna die, like Quentin?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm afraid so, buddy.
I didn't get to say goodbye to Quentin.
do I get to say goodbye to grandpa?
Yes.
Yes, let's do that.
come here.
look, I apologize if we got our lines crossed here.
I just thought that you understood
I was interested in you for the coaching position.
and I-I appreciate it.
I'm flattered, okay? I really am.
but I'm not ready for that yet. I can still play.
Nathan, that was no small injury you suffered.
it was spinal-cord, right?
Yeah. Yeah, it was lower-back.
well, most guys wouldn't even be thinking about coming back.
they'd just be thinking about walking right.
I'm not most guys.
and I can appreciate that.
look, I've been rehabbing, okay? I'm in shape. I can play.
you just have to let me show you.
I have the utmost respect for you wanting to play again.
you're a warrior. You always have been.
but I'm looking for a coach.
now, I've always valued how smart a player you were.
and I know that you've been coaching.
Nathan, this is where your future is.
all right.
I hope that you will think about it.
I know that you will be a great as set here, very popular, and great for attendance.
I know you'd do a good job.
Hello?
I know you're in the middle of it. I'm sorry.
no, it's okay.
kind of a break in the action right now. What's up?
um, nothing. I just wanted to hear your voice.
Peyton, what's going on?
it's Mick. He's my father.
wait. He said that? I mean, he told you?
no, no, not yet. Um, but that's what tonight's about.
he's coming over for dinner.
but you're sure he's your dad?
Yeah, he slipped up, and I just
I know.
I mean, I-I honestly think I've known since the minute we met.
but...he's my father, Luke.
it's gonna be okay, Peyton.
you think so?
cause I'm kind of nervous.
you're gonna do great.
I just wish I was there.
Luke, they're ready for us.
Hey, I'm sorry, but they need me.
um, I'll call you as soon as I get out, okay?
okay. Luke? - Yeah?
I always feel better when I get to talk to you.
I love you. Thanks.
love you too. Bye.
so, there you have it, Lucas.
you'll have signing sin all the major markets.
we're looking at a major ad buy in print and radio.
and we're working on all the regional and national talk shows.
that sounds great.
all that's left to discuss is the schedule.
we want you to start strong, so Omaha's up first on the 24th.
your first book sold very well there.
next - um, excuse me.
I have a problem with the Chicago date.
we --the schedule's pretty firm at this point.
Yeah, I'm -- I'm sorry, but I can't.
Lucas, Chicago's our second-biggest market.
a change is gonna cost a lot of money.
I understand. But I need to change it, okay?
Luke, can I see you in my office for a second?
Lucas, what are you doing? This book launch is a really big deal.
I know that. I just
you know they didn't even want to do a book tour? They didn't.
but I made them because I believe in you and I fight for you.
I appreciate it. - What could possibly be more important than Chicago?
my wedding.
it's Peyton.
we're getting married.
and that's why I can't go to Chicago.
I see.
I wanted to tell you, okay? But...
then why didn't you?
I just...
I'll talk to them about Chicago.
I guess I was right all along about you and Peyton.
but I wish you could have done this over the phone.
so, do you think I was foolish to give my company to my mother?
do you think you were foolish?
do you always answer a question with another question?
does it bother you?
in my humble opinion, it was never truly going to be your company as long as she was part of it.
Yeah.
after I did it, I felt great.
at first, I felt liberated, but now I just...
I feel kind of empty.
everything that I worked for is gone.
I just have this store.
and even that's empty now.
that freedom you were jealous of can be scary sometimes.
have you talked to anyone else about this?
no.
I saw my best friend today, and I couldn't bring myself to tell her.
why do you think that was?
I don't know.
I feel a little...
a little bit like I failed.
you know?
I'm watching all my friends move on with their lives
Haley and her family, and Millicent is moving to be with mouth, and Peyton with Lucas --and they're all moving forward.
and it's like I am stuck here, standing still, and...
Brooke, you're 22 years old and the founder of a multi-million-dollar corporation.
I'd hardly call that standing still.
but it's gone.
you'll do something else.
you're intelligent, you're creative.
you'll figure it out.
right. But what if i don't figure it out?
you will.
but that's not the real question.
then what is?
all you've talked about is your work, Brooke.
but when you mention your friends being happy, you define that happiness strictly in terms of relationships and family.
the question is, why are you so insistent on going through life alone?
so, what do you think?
I don't know.
listen, letting go of playing is hard.
it was for all of us.
but it doesn't mean you have to let go of basketball.
I have to talk to my family about it.
you do that.
I'll stall for a few days and wait to hear back from you.
okay, dad. I'm waiting.
I never meant to hurt you.
not then...and not now.
I know.
the thing is, I saw it coming all along.
I just tried to wish it away.
it wasn't fair to me or to you.
Chicago will be fine.
I'll make it okay.
thank you.
well, I should go.
I'm gonna miss my flight.
okay.
all right.
you forgot something.
Lindsey --it's okay.
you know, the first time we met -- right here
I told you I was pulling for the couple in the book.
goodbye, Lucas.
it's not too late, you know.
too late for what?
to stop all this.
Mm. I'm afraid I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
please.
I'm begging you.
please"?
Where's the big scary guy from the motel, Dan?
the guy who was gonna kill me?
I guess you're not so tough when the shoe's on the other foot.
you touch one hair on Jamie's head, and you'll get to meet him.
you crazy bitch!
Aaah! No! Aah!
looks like someone needs a little something to make sure they're on their best behavior.
sweet dreams.
no.
well, well. Look who's here.
okay, pal. I need you to stay in the car. I'll be right back.
I just want to make sure we're in the right place.
I want to come with you.
just stay in the car. Keep the doors locked. I'll be right back. I promise.
okay.
Oh, god, Dan.
Dan, it's Haley! Wake up!
help.
I have Jamie with me.
get Jamie.
Dan, what is going on? What happened to you?
Hello, Mrs. Scott.
okay, There you are
mama. Where are you, mama?
Aah! Hi, Jamie! It's me -- nanny Carrie. Open up.
No! Mama says you're a bad person!
Oh, that's not true. I love you. Remember?
now, open the door, buddy.
No! I want my mama!
I am your mama now!
now, unlock that door this instant!
No!
looks like somebody needs to learn some manners.
Haley, you have to get up.
wake up.
you have to wake up.
I'm sorry I got mad, sweetie!
just tell me where you are, Jimmy-Jam.
I won't be mad anymore. I promise.
I've got something special for you.
it's mama.
I'm really sorry to bug you up there, Nathan.
I just -- I really need to talk with you.
it's not good. You should call me, okay? I love you. Bye.
it's gonna be okay. I promise.
we just have to get you out of here, okay? Okay.
run!
run, Jamie!
run! Run!
guess there's more than one crazy nanny in this town.
bitch.
are you okay?
how's Jamie?
he's -- he's scared to death. He's gonna be okay.
how are you?
this was a 1995dom pignon ros?
I was saving it for the day I was rid of Dan Scott for good.
a girl can dream, right?
you saved us. How did you know?
how did you know that we were here?
I knew something was up when I saw the address.
Dan always hated the woods.
God, I hate the woods.
are you okay?
I'm fine. Excuse me.
uh, just the check, please.
it's taken care of, honey.
what do you mean?
you didn't have to do that.
Yeah, well, I figure it's your money, anyway.
besides, I owed you for that shirt.
well, um...got to bounce. Curfew.
my mom worries if I'm out too late.
it's not a bad thing to have a mom who worries about you.
Yeah.
just shut up and pour, okay?
Hi.
Hi.
I heard there was a great start up company around here looking forits first employee.
victoria called me today to fire me.
I guess she didn't know you already did that.
so, what do you say?
you looking?
I might be.
it'll be long hours, horrible pay, and no job security.
it sounds perfect.
you think you can kill me?
you can't kill me. I'm still here.
I already called the police. They're on their way.
so? What are they gonna do?
I'll get out, and I'll come back.
do you remember what I told you I'd do if you ever came near my family again?
I told you I'd kill you.
but you didn't. I'm not dead.
sure you are.
Nate, Mike Wilson.
listen, I heard you were looking for the opportunity to play ball again.
this is the coolest thing I've ever seen.
you have to do this, daddy.
this can't be good for my back.
man, that can't be good for nobody's back.
you're coming home.
I guess never really left.
can you help me make a cape?
Quentin really likes mine, and I thought maybe we could make one for him, too.
tell me where you live, because I'm pretty sure it's not in shop class.
I live in a foster home.
would you be interested in fostering a child?
well, I guess it would depend on the situation.
I've never had my own room before.
you should read this. It's really cool.
huh? My book?
no. It's an article about moving in together.
it says we need to have our own space in order to ease the transition.
I'm ahead of you.
what is that?
Oh, it's your cage, silly.
I figured you need your own space.
and look, it's even got a little bed of hay.
I know how you like hay.
Luke, cut it out.
come on. Get up
man, Brooke looks hot here.
maybe you two could share the cage, huh?
what?
funny, I don't remember ordering bad italian.
sorry to bother you so late, but, uh, caught you buying drinks at the bar tonight.
I know the license is yours, but she claims to belong to you, too.
you have a 15-year-old daughter?
how long has it been?
not long enough.
Thanks.
you're welcome. Sam?
can you just yell at me in the morning?
I'm really tired.
I'll bet you are.
because being Brooke Davis is exhausting!
I miss Angie.
Millie, what are you doing in Omaha?
What?!
Oh, my god! What are you doing here?
I had this horrible dream where I lived far away from you, and every time I spoke, I'd say this awful catchphrase.
only it wasn't a dream.
so I quit my job. Again.
for me? - For us.
without you, Omaha just felt cold and lonely.
do you feel better now?
now I'm just cold.
get in here.
whoa, daddy can fly. - Yes, he can.
Oh, I can't tell you how happy it makes me to see you playing again.
Thanks, baby.
you know, it'd really make me happy to see you play again.
you haven't been in the studio in a while.
Yeah, well, too much has happened lately to think about music.
well, the deal was we both go after our dreams, remember?
Yeah, mama.
I like when you sing.
Oh, you do, huh?
well, I hope you don't think that I'm uncool when I say that you're late for school oh, never mind.
I'll see you. Okay, bye.
see you, buddy.
Hey. How'd you sleep?
not very well.
someone hit me with a magazine.
I'm sorry.
I was reading an article in B. Davis magazine, and I had a bad dream.
it's about moving in together.
what's so scary about that?
Well,"once you move in, expect to find out you don't know each other as well as you think.
that's ridiculous.
everybody says we're like twins.
okay, you're right.
and to make up for the magazine attack,
I'm making your favorite breakfast.
Oh, really? French toast?
pancakes.
pancakes!
Sam, I made breakfast!
come on!
unbelievable.
cut it out!
cut it out!
let go! You'll rip it!
so? Then you'll have two stupid capes.
it's not stupid! I wear it for my friend Quentin!
then Quentin must be stupid.
fight, fight, fight, fight!
move in, don't expect his stuff to move out.
apparently guys don't like changing anything when a woman moves in.
that's not true.
Oh, really? That's funny.
cause yesterday when I was cleaning,
I knocked over a picture of you and Lindsey.
I, uh...I - I thought I got all those.
I-I'm sorry.
Nah, I know I'm being silly.
I just feel like a guest in your house.
and I haven't unpacked any of my boxes 'cause I don't know where to put anything.
well, does the all-knowing magazine have a fix, or does it just point out problems?
let's see. It says we should work it out by communicating openly, compromising, and focusing on each other.
doesn't just say that we should have sex?
fine.
how about this? Okay...
neither one of us leaves until you're completely moved in.
okay?
I mean, unless, that is, that my sugar mama needs to work.
Oh, no, your sugar mama's her own boss.
and she just gave me some time off.
okay.
then it's official.
we are ...on house arrest.
haiku is a japanese poem which consists of three lines of five, seven, and five syllables, respectively.
a good example of this would be
my friend, Brooke Davis blowing through my class like wind Sam in trouble, no?
I hate school.
school was never my strong suit, either.
it's a good thing we're both handsome.
what's wrong?
I got in a fight with Chuck Scholnik 'cause he teased me about my cape.
I know the Scholnik family.
you should tease him about his alcoholic mother.
I just want him to leave me alone.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
I was teased when I was in prison.
about what?
the point is that as a Scott man, people are always gonna be jealous of you.
it's a burden we have to live with.
Scott men are inherently better than most people.
daddy, too?
especially your daddy.
I thought we were past dressing up to impress each other.
does this mean I need to toss the footie pajamas?
well, if the alternative is you sleeping naked, yes.
I'm going to the station to beg for my old job.
I hope they take me back.
they'd be stupid not to.
you're a big TV star now.
with your own catchphrase and everything.
I'm sorry I ever spent a minute away from you.
you just said a mouthful.
very funny.
I'm sorry disrupted your class.
it's okay. I turned you into a haiku.
Gesundheit.
I take itthings aren't going very well between you and Sam.
she stole my I. D. Last night and snuck out.
when you asked me to take her, I thought I'd be getting little orphan annie.
instead of singing and dancing,
I have stealing and disappearing.
do you want me to talk to her?
no. No, I'll handle it.
okay.
how do I handle it?
you got to talk to her tonight and lay down some ground rules.
she needs structure.
she's actually a really bright kid.
fine.
for you, I will try.
I just -- I need her to try, too, you know?
even if it's just a little.
I think that's totally fair.
good.
I'll let you know how it goes.
thank you, Brooke.
Yeah, thank me if I don't kill her by tomorrow.
so where do you want to start?
well, that's easy.
I never feel at home until I unpack my music.
but you know what? Maybe we don't have to.
I mean, we probably have doubles of everything, right?
actually, I don't like the cure.
how can you not likethe cure?
well, their music's depressing and whiny.
Yeah, and if it could squint, it would be you.
you do realize that the lyrics I spent all day painting at the river court were cure lyrics, right?
Oh, yeah, I know. And I love the lyrics.
I hate the music.
I don't even know who you are right now.
come on, Peyton. Look, I'm just trying to be honest.
I mean, there's got to be things that I like that you don't, right?
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
now that you mention it.
your tattoo.
what about it?
well, first off, it does not mean what you think it does, 'cause I looked it up.
second, Brooke hasa very similar tattoo.
near her lady business.
now, if you will excuse me,
I'm gonna go take my cure albums where they'll be appreciated.
like the trash?
you see? We are totally different just like the article says.
thanks a lot, Brooke.
Okay..."Friday I'm In Love" isn't too bad it's nice in here.
how come we haven't moved into the master bedroom?
you mean my mom's room?
no, I mean the master bedroom.
I mean, she gave you the house, right
Yeah.
it'd just be...too weird sleeping in here as an adult.
who said anything about sleeping?
Oh, ho ho ho! No. Definitely out of the question.
Luke, we are adults.
shouldn't we be in the adult room?
who's asking?
you, or B. Davis magazine?
whichever will get you to do it.
I would tell the magazine that my room's bigger.
and I like it better.
and I would tell Peyton that...
...that I would do anything for her, even something as creepy as sleeping in my mom's room.
then I guess I'm asking.
then I guess I'm moving.
I love your music. - Thank you.
your album is one of my favorites.
Thanks.
I even have a slot reserved in my cd case for your next record.
there is gonna be a next record, right?
I hope so.
I hope so, too.
your voice is incredible.
you're not so bad yourself.
you don't have a cd I can buy, do you?
no, no. I-I just do this for fun.
but it must be amazing to sing for a living.
it used to be.
so much has been going on lately, music doesn't seem to matter much.
that's too bad, because it matters to a lot of other people.
well, it looks like your music matters a lot, too.
you don't want to keep your fans waiting.
neither do you.
Hi, Chris.
I wanted to talk to you about how we left things.
just hear me out.
I know that Omaha's a bigger market.
but this is your home.
I agree, which is why - - what'll it take?
we need you.
well, uh, I could use an office, better snacks in the lunch room.
and, uh, I had an internin Omaha.
done, done, and done.
thing is, we need you to start A. S.A. P.
like, uh...tomorrow?
what do you think?
I think Omaha's gonna miss me.
Yeah. Terrific.
Hey, buddy.
your mom and I would like to talk to you for a second.
think you could pause that game?
not if I'm in trouble.
you're not in trouble.
we just heard you got in a fight at school today.
a kid grabbed my cape.
he wouldn't let go of it. He said it was stupid.
sounds like that kidis stupid.
I mean, a man should know never to grab another man's cape.
your cape, kiddo, is not stupid, okay?
Hey, when I was younger, I had a poncho that everybody else said was really ugly, but I really liked it, so I kept wearing it.
and that's what you should do. If you like your cape, you should just wear it whenever you want and ignore what everybody else says.
well, what if he keeps picking on me?
Oh, well, I can teach you how to deal with bullies.
and what your father means by that is if somebody's picking on you, you should just walk away.
right, honey?
Yes. Yes, she's right.
but I want to be tough like daddy.
well, hey.
if you can learn to walk away, you'll be tougher than I ever was.
it's not funny.
I'm sorry.
I'm only laughing because of how angry you got.
I mean, I've never heardany body yell at it before.
Oh, honey, it is not a big deal.
doesn't it happen to every guy at some point?
and it wouldn't have happened at all if we weren't in my mom's bed!
this is your fault.
well, you have never complained before.
I'm talking about your obsession with this stupid magazine.
Oh, my god, the magazine has been dead on.
it has predicted pretty much everything.
I just wish it would have warned me about this.
okay, all right.
okay.
what are you doing?
well, it seems I've made a huge mistake.
I'm calling Lindsey.
fine.
if you think that'll help.
Hey. Have I been in tonight?
was that a trick question?
Sam? Have you seen her?
not since last night.
why, did she run outon you again?
no.
she's actually waiting in the car.
I just needed an excuse to see you.
sorry I asked.
you know, you're a jerk.
I told you I wanted to be a mom, and you ran away so fast, you left an owen-shaped hole in my front door, and I never heard from you again.
not so much as a phone call.
and if you hadn't caught little Brooke Davis junior with my I. D. I still wouldn't have.
you're right.
you didn't deserve that.
I'm sorry.
whatever.
you're still a jerk.
what's going on?
when moving in, "be ready for him to unpack this little secret
he wants his own space.
if it's in the magazine, it must be true.
so you stay on your side of the line, and you get my mom's bed.
and I'll get the TV and the kitchen, huh?
what is this,"the brady bunch"?
just so you know, if you cross this line, you'll be admitting that this article is stupid.
and that I'm right about everything.
fine. Looks like I get the bathroom.
fine.
I'm hungry.
I think I'll go make myself some, uh...french toast.
Oh, it is so on.
sweetie, is that the boy that was picking on you?
no. I thought my shoew as untied.
Bye, mama.
Bye, sweetie.
excuse me, could I talk to you for a second?
I'm haley Scott. I'm Jamie's mom.
jamie came home from school upset the other day.
I guess your son was teasing him.
well, you know how boys are.
don't you think we should do something about it?
no, I think it's best if we let the boys work it out for themselves.
so much better than tattling, don't you think?
uh, he's not tattling.
he's 5 years old, and he just wants to be left alone.
is he the one with the cape?
5 is a little old for a cape, don't you think?
maybe you should do him a favor, take it away from him, and then he won't get teased anymore.
about the cape, anyway.
what is that supposed to mean?
he's probably just a late bloomer.
I'm sure he'll make friends...someday.
listen, honey, if your little brat doesn't stop picking on my son, not only will I give jamie permission to kick his ass, but I'll be kicking your ass right along side of him.
got that, bitch?
I'd like to see you try, little girl.
what happened to walking away?
I know, but you didn't see her.
she was such a bitch.
sounds like you made that pretty clear.
Jamie's been through so much lately, the last thing he needs is some bully picking on him.
he'll be fine.
he's a tough kid.
but you know what? I'll take care of it.
in the meantime, just try not to kill anybody, okay, slugger?
what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna call his mom a bitch and then push her.
Oh, that's right.
you already did that, didn't you?
look, I don't know what I'm gonna do, okay?
but I'll take care of it. I'll think of something.
I'm sorry.
Oh, are you kidding me?
my girl is a bad ass.
that's hot.
damn, he's good.
looky what I found on my side.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
you cross, you lose.
Fergie, I love you very much and miss you every time we're apart.
I need to see you...soon.
don't you dare.
Oops.
what's up?
Lucas loves him some fergalicious.
Hi, Brooke. It's nice to see you, too.
I'm sorry. I was just hoping you might be Sam.
but apparently all she know show to do is leave.
is it that bad?
I think she likes me about as much as I like my mother.
well, we both know there's some parents you're better off without but you're not one of them.
she'll realize that.
unfortunately, she hasn't stuck around long enough to figure that out.
thank you for coming to check on me.
well, actually, I need a favor.
it's last minute, it's a lot of work, and I need it in two hours.
as tempting as that sounds,
I'm still orphan-deep in the last favor I did for the Scott family.
it's for Jamie.
what do you need?
it's my new hero!
Hey!
I've been here three years.
I've never gotten a raise.
you tell them to shove their job, you get a better position, a new office and a hot intern.
well, I don't know if hot intern?
wait, you guys know each other?
we were high-school lovers.
nice!
it's a bird!
it's a plane!
it's superbaby!
Aw, are you sad?
are you gonna go fly home to your mommy?
no. I'm gonna walk away.
so who doesn't think that capes are cool?
well, if I didn't have a cape, I couldn't do this.
Oh, by the way, that box right there is full of capes, if anybody wants one.
you didn't come home last night.
it's not my home.
besides, you said I could come and go as I please.
so I left.
that is not what I meant.
I was worried about you.
Sam...I can't help you if you're not willing to be helped.
apparently, you'd rather eat here than in my kitchen, and you want to sleep in a car instead of my guest room.
I don't know what to do for you.
I just don't thinkth is is gonna work.
it's okay.
I'm used to people giving up on me.
happens all the time.
see that waitress over there?
that's my mom.
one day, I'm gonna tell her who I am, and what a big mistake she made.
like I said, I'm used to people giving up on me.
thanks anyway.
my god.
so, my girlfriend and imoved to Omaha, but then my girlfriend moved back.
so I decided to move back to be with her.
you're so much more muscular than you were in high school.
Yeah, my girlfriend is really into being healthy, so I am, too.
for my -- my girlfriend.
what have you been up to?
going to college. I'm taking journalism classes.
having lots of sex.
Oh, and my mom had her appendix out last week.
That'S...wow.
it's so good to see you again.
it's weird, though, because I was thinking about you just the other day.
Oh, yeah? What about?
well, I was walking to class, and all of a sudden, I thought, "I should have had sex with mouth.
isn't that weird?
Yeah, that is weird.
did I mention that I have a girlfriend?
cool. -I do, too.
sometimes.
so, Nathan told me about the capes.
you are officially the world's greatest godmother, and you've totally made Jamie's year.
thank you so much, Brooke.
at least I ade one kid happy today.
what happened?
I was gonna talk to Sam last night like you said.
and she never showed.
and I just told herI can't help her anymore.
I'm sorry, haley. - No, no.
I should not have forced her on you.
I just thought...
if anyone could handle her, you could, because you were a lot like her, and you got past it.
I thought she could, too, if somebody gave her a chance.
well, I guess I'm not strong enough.
Brooke, you -- you're the strongest person I know.
you just gave up amultimillion-dollar corporation, and you seem fine about it.
I wish I had your strength.
my strength?
Haley, you gave up your singing career to be with Nathan, who was at least as screwed up as me or Sam when you got a hold of him.
and now he's the best guy I know.
look, it was scary.
I was scared to death to give up the company.
but it wasn't fun anymore.
and now I get to do what I fell in love with
design clothes on my terms.
Yeah. That sounds familiar.
I met a girl who sing son the street every day for fun.
it's amazing. She seems so happy.
music used to belike that for me, and it's just not anymore.
you know?
well, then you need to make it fun again.
find what you loved about it and start there.
you're too strong not to.
I will think about it.
okay.
you're definitely done with Sam?
I'll think about it.
Oh, that's just not fair.
what are you talking about?
Oh, you know what? It's dark in my room, so I was just gonna crash early.
all by myself.
well, it's nice and bright in my room.
thought I'd do a little reading before bed.
maybe you should re-read your book and think about the comet and how close it is, but you can't touch it,'cause you're stubborn.
maybe I will.
I love my book.
good, good.
I love sleeping naked.
damn, she's good.
and then daddy jumped 8 feet and dunk the ball.
I was the most popular kid in school.
I even got six girls' digitslike uncle skills taught me.
Really? Uncle skills?
well, I'll be having a conversation with uncle skills.
get used to being popular. You're a scott boy.
mama, why don't you wear your poncho anymore?
I think one day, I just out grew it.
good night, buddy.
good night.
I haven't told you how proud of you I am for walking away today.
I didn't want to, but you said it would make me tough.
it does.
it took me a long time to learn that lesson.
those kids teased you about your cape, and you wore it anyway.
they wanted to fight you, and you just walked away.
see, there's leaders, and there's followers, and you are a leader.
I wouldn't have fought him, but he said Quentin was stupid, and Quentin was not stupid.
Quentin was my friend.
that's right. He was your friend.
and he would beproud of you, too.
good night, buddy.
trust me, back seats are not meant for sleeping.
what are you doing here?
I thought I'd crash at your place tonight.
I know what it feels like to have parents who give up on you.
I had one who ignored me, and one who resented me.
and sometimes, I feel like I'd be better off if I never had parents at all.
no, you wouldn'T.
Sam, I don't want to make the same mistakes our parents made.
I want you to move in with me on an official foster-home basis if you want to.
what's the catch?
there's no catch.
there are rules.
Breakfastis at 7: 00 A. M. Sharp.
and no more stealing my stuff or anyone else's, but mostly mine.
deal?
deal.
that is the last thing.
I promise.
what you did for Jamie was amazing.
I didn't do that for Jamie.
I did that for Chuck's mom.
I was afraid you were gonna kill her.
well, you saved the day for everyone, like a big old superhero.
you don't need a side kick, do you?
a sidekick?
no. Oh!
no, I think tomorrow I'll go back to being mild-mannered slam-ball playerna than scott.
I wouldn't call youmild-mannered.
what about you? What are you doing tomorrow?
I think I'm in the mood to do some singing.
it's about time.
I tell you to stay, and you disappear.
I tell you to get lost, and you're at my doorstep.
apparently you have everything backwards, so come on in.
wait, wait, wait. Hey, can
can we talk? - Sure.
how have you been? There, we talked.
now, if you don't mind, it's late, and I havea young girl sleeping inside.
I just want a chance to explain myself.
fine.
explain.
look, I got freaked out when you mentioned the baby.
I had a horrible childhood.
then I get addicted to heroin really early on.
now I avoid anything more responsible than making drinks.
the thought of me being a father is just too much.
I never asked youto be the father.
I know.
but if you ever did.
I know I wouldn't be any good at it.
so I disappeared.
and you have every right to be mad at me.
and I'm sorry.
have you ever considered that going through all those awful experiences is exactly what would make youa good father someday?
I've seen you be responsable with Rachel and care with Jamie.
you even brought Sam home, and she's a total stranger to you.
well, truth be told,
I just brought her home'cause I wanted to see you.
okay, well, if she's at the bar tonight, then bring her home, and you will see me again.
then I hope she'sin the drinking mood.
but if not, then I hope the real Brooke Davis will stop by.
I promise you, I won't go anywhere this time.
I'll think about it.
jerk.
you know, I read somewhere that you should never go to bed angry.
now, it wasn't B. Davis magazine, so I'm not sureif it's very valid.
I'm not angry.
in fact, I've actually had fun these last few days playing around.
especially sinceI've been winning.
Well...before you get too excited, may I remind you that your moving boxes were on my side of the line.
What'd you do?
well, I just unpacked some of your stuff.
I found a really great picture to replace the one of Lindsey.
Oh, Luke, that is sweet.
of course you went through my art again without asking permission.
my side, my art, babe.
I think I'm starting to like your side better.
I was about to say the same thing.
let's be on the same side again.
I really have to go to the bathroom.
Oh, my god, I'm starving.
mm, somebody smells good. Hot date?
no? Why? It's just work.
touchy, touchy. I'm just saying you smell good.
I'd say you look good, too, but I don't want to get hit.
well, go ahead. Risk it.
so how was your first day back?
was everyone happy to see you?
some of them.
well, I'm thrilled to have you back.
so do you have yournew tree hill catch phrase yet?
I don't think I'm gonna need one.
Oh, sure you will.
how about"mouthing off from the hill"?
no.
if a tree falls, your mouth will make a sound?
please stop.
or what about - how's this?
I'm Marvin Mcfadden, and I am so glad I'm back here with you.
I love it.
Bye, grandpa!
see you, buddy.
Bye, honey. - Ms. Scholnik...
Dan Scott, Jamie's grandfather.
that's a cute kid.
well, kid, anyway.
you know, I hear he and Jamie got in a little scufflethe other day.
I sure hope they work it out.
you know what? I think they already have.
you know, I'd love to join you for your morning drink, but I'm late for a meeting with my parole officer.
murder.
Hey! Tell me you're on your way to the studio to make your new record.
uh, actually,
I was thinking about doing singing for fun today.
what do you think? You up for a duet?
are you kidding? I would be honored.
great. What do you want to play?
uh, how about this one?
Sam! Breakfast!
Hey.
you said breakfast at 7: 00.
it's 7: 00.
it's a start.
breakfast!
well, your stuff is unpacked.
the tape is gone.
and the house is officially both of ours.
perfect timing.
I made waffles.
I love waffles. - I do, too.
Plus, I got the recipe from B. Davis magazine, so you know it'll be good.
you better enjoy them, because, um...
I canceled your subscription.
What?!
holy cow.
I forgot there was a world out side the house.
Hey, luke. I got your text.
Hey, Jamie! Did your dad bring you to school?
he's the coolest!
Yeah, Scotts rule. - Yeah.
do you wantto play kickball?
you can be on my team.
whoa, Chuck, slow your roll.
maybe another time.
why aren't you wearingyour cape?
well, some people lead, and some people follow.
do you know what's missing?
cash from the register and the sketches for my new line.
I don't trust you or like you.
so how about you stay out of my bed
and stay away from Marvin?
you need to convince Lucas to do the movie.
and you'll make it the movie he wants it to be.
Absolutely.
Hey, Nate.
I'm happy to be a part of it, man.
what's that?
the comeback.
don't call it a comeback, man.
a little old man and I fell out.
I'll tell you what it was all about.
he had money, and I had none,
and that's the way the noise begun.
sure?
Yep. 74 inches, daddy.
I can measure again. - No.
it's okay. I've been 6'2" since I was 17.
is that bad?
well, if I was 6'5," I might be in the pros by now.
what if you were 8'5"?
I'd probably be dead of heart failure.
well, I think 6'2" is perfect.
heck, I'd settle for 4'2."
well, you can thank your short-pants mom for that. - Hey!
he got some good stuff from me,
like the piano he's gonna rock at the talent show tonight, huh?
Yeah. - Are you gonna be there, daddy?
I wouldn't miss it.
I wish I could come with you today. - I know.
I tell you what ... I'll tell you all about it, okay?
and this idea you have?
it's what you want to do?
it's what I have to do.
Sam! Breakfast!
Hi.
he spent the night in your bed?
in my house?!
well, I thought it was about time a guy stayed here.
watch yourself.
look, he's my friend, and he lives with his brother. And he just ...
he beats on him sometimes, and he needed a place to crash.
okay.
does this half-nude, window-fleeing friend have a name?
John "Jack" Daniels.
you expect me to believe that a boy named after the white-trash-rock-band drink of choice
spent the night in your bed and nothing happened?
dude, I'm like 15.
like that matters! When I was 15 ...
never mind.
tell me when someone is staying in my house,
and if your friend needs a place to "crash" again,
he can sleep on the couch!
now just go do something.
Hi, Luke.
I'll stay on the movie...
because it matters to me.
but you and I are not friends,
and you and Peyton aren't anything.
how is our girl Peyton?
and how long have you been experiencing this pain?
a few days.
any history of diabetes in the family? Ulcers?
Um...no.
cancer?
my birth mother died of cancer. Why?
what ... what's the face that you're making?
we just want to run some tests.
consider it a test.
you fly to Los Angeles, and while you're gone,
if Peyton doesn't fall in love with me again,
then you'll know you two were meant to be.
you're a dick. You know that?
listen, the truth is, this guy's an a-list director.
he's got several offers, and you need to meet with him.
today? Why?
because I told you we'd be equal partners on this movie,
and I need you to sign off on him.
what are you gonna do?
I'm producing a movie, Luke.
contrary to popular belief, I'm not staying in town to hit on your fiancy.
it's your book.
what?
you just froze there, halfway out the window.
you looked like such a dork.
well, you're the one who didn't set the alarm right.
whatever. She thought we were doing it.
as if.
what do you mean, "as if"?
a lot of girls would do it with me.
Yeah.
but those girls are called prostitutes.
Why?
Hi.
producer guy, right?
orphan girl, right? From the concert?
I know.
you can help me.
good. You can help me, too.
so, what happens at this what do you call it?
it's called a combine.
coaches and scouts from the pro teams come watch you play.
and they pick you for the NBA?
you find them yet? - No.
Hey, I think you should wear the number 12 next.
Why?
I don't know. I like the number 12.
that's what I'm gonna wear when I'm in the pros.
all right. - Okay, I found them.
Oh, good.
these are really ugly, dad.
well, they made a few models, so just pick one you like, you knucklehead.
okay.
so, your mom's pretty excited sbout you playing the piano at your talent show tonight.
I know.
you don't sound very pumped up.
I just kind of wanted to tell jokes.
dude, I've heard your jokes.
trust me, stick with the piano.
but the song is a kiddy song, and I'm not very good at it.
well, all you can do is the best you can, all right?
that's all that matters.
speaking of which, are you telling me you can't find those shoes by now?
Oh, I found the shoes a long time ago. I just like it up here.
we found the shoes.
Yay!
all set?
Yeah.
all right.
see you at the talent show. - Go be great.
love you.
love you.
daddy.
all you can do is your best, okay?
you want some coffee with that sugar?
how do you take yours?
I don't. Never touch the stuff.
so, you said I could help you out. How so?
I was thinking, um,
maybe you could read some of the stuff I wrote.
you're a screen writer?
I just write things. I get a little pissed off sometimes, you know?
okay. Tell me about Brooke Davis.
dude, I am so not hooking you two up.
no, no, her clothing line. Is she any good?
Yeah. Think you'd be lucky to have her.
for the movie, right? That's why you're asking?
give me your phone.
this is my number.
I'm happy to read anything you want to send me.
you'd do that?
I mean, I just kind of heard you're a dick.
I am. But maybe I'll read something I can steal.
I got this.
Hey, is she single ...Brooke?
no.
Yeah.
you know, I'm betting you're actually nice.
and I'm betting you're not bitter.
keep writing, Sam.
she's out of your league, my brother.
I told Gigi to stay away from Marvin, and the next thing I know,
she's hugging him in the parking lot.
what were you doing in the parking lot?
spying.
well, what am I supposed to do? She's a horny college party girl.
Millie, he's amused by her.
so, I don't want a guy who's amused by someone like that.
okay.
I know those girls...
because I've been those girls.
and all guys are amused by it.
it doesn't mean anything. Mouth is not gonna fall for that.
he's not.
trust me, she's harmless.
you ever think about having sex on the news desk?
no.
maybe. What are you doing?
well, the news team is on location, so Chris said I could have my going-away party in here tonight.
6: 30 okay?
actually, I have to go to Jamie's talent show.
I'm totally not having my going-away party without you.
please.
one drink. I wouldn't miss it.
you're gonna have to miss it.
Peyton, come on!
you have to get back into the studio.
Mia, I'm being very serious, okay?
I'm so proud of you, and the first record did great.
but our label friend, John, who I do not have a thing for,
is getting very impatient for the next one,
so just tell me that you have been working on the demos I asked you to do.
Peyton, I've had a lot going on.
okay, fine.
how many songs do you have?
I have a couple ideas.
all right.
the label would like for you to listen to this.
what for?
because there are some very talented, very expensive songwriters on there,
and they want you to pick a track to record.
but I write my own songs. - Apparently not.
apparently, you just write a couple ideas.
Hello? Hi.
Oh, Luke. Hi, honey. I'm sorry.
no, no, no, I was just expecting another call.
Yeah. No, I had to leave really early this morning.
um, I had a ... like a meeting with a band.
can you hold on one second? Okay.
please, just listen to that.
Hi, okay. Sorry.
l. A? Why are you going to L. A.?
name and affiliation?
Nathan Scott, university of Maryland.
professional affiliation.
who invited you to the combine?
no one did, sir.
these are professional trials, son ... invitation only.
I understand that.
look, I was an all-American at Maryland last season,
and I was just hoping that...
look, this is kind of my last shot.
didn't you get thrown through a window?
please.
I'm sorry. You can't be here.
he's with us.
better go suit up.
Oh, well "Breakfast club." You were the priss.
let me guess. You were the stoner?
well, if you say so. They end up together.
can I help you?
you should design the wardrobe for the movie.
I'm not a costume designer.
Oh. I can see that.
I'm starting a new line.
well, okay, let me try this again.
you should design the wardrobe for the movie.
you were there, it's authentic, it's press-worthy, and I would be lucky to have you before the debut of your new line,
which I'm sure is going to be fabulous.
sorry.
Hello?
Yes, this is me.
it is too me.
Oh, listen, I'm with Brooke right now.
no, I'm not gonna blow it.
no, I am not. No, I'm not.
sorry. Sam says hi.
Sam? My sam?
and why does my Sam have your phone number?
she has an interest in the film industry.
she is 15, you pervert.
okay, just wrap your head around it, okay?
you and the movie, I mean. Not me and Sam. She's only 15, you know.
you pervert.
Hey, man, whose shoes are those?
mine.
I know that, but I'm saying, who else shoes are they?
I heard what you asked.
I meant what I said. They're mine.
whatever you say, baller.
kid got his own shoe contract, But he's still trying out for the big league.
don't matter none, anyhow.
ain't nobody gonna give no roster spot to no fool with no green elf shoes on.
Hey, man, let me see those things, riddler.
37 inches.
get a close enough look?
shame how you've let yourself go, Nate.
you were kind of skanky, weren't you?
what?
in high school. You acted all weird this morning
because you were totally having sex at 15.
I was not.
you were, too. Is that where "clothes over bros" came from?
tired of being the dirty girl? 'Cause you're a bit of a prude now.
first of all, shut it.
second of all, if I have been a little frigid lately...
...It's probably because I was attacked at my store...
not long before you moved in,
and it's made me a little closed off ...
especially with boys.
Oh, my god. Brooke, did he ... - No.
no
but I've been really angry about it,
and I have a whole another set of issues with Owen.
and I'm...
trying to let it all go, and I just wanted you to know.
because I just want you to know.
okay?
okay.
and, yeah...
for the record, I was pretty slutty in high school.
and I wish I wouldn't have been, beause you don't get to take any of that back.
I like talking to you.
Thanks, Sam. I like talking to you, too.
excuse me!
excuse me!
Hi.
uh, I'm ...
and in that moment, he realized it's not what you are or who you are,
but who they allow you to be.
that is good writing.
really good writing!
I love this script.
love it!
I don't want to come out.
come on, buddy. I want to see you.
no, I look like a tool.
you look so awesome!
I look like a penguin.
you look cute! Now come over here, and we will go over this song again.
little tie!
looks so cute.
sorry, I always mess that up. - It's okay.
you nervous? - A little.
Yeah, you definitely get that from me.
I wonder how daddy's doing.
I remember now. You played at maryland, right?
got into a scrape right before the draft.
man, you that fool.
you hear that?
point guard!
thank you, god and my mama.
Nathan Scott, ladies and gentlemen.
Ooh, 6'2" shooting guard.
are there any scouts out here for the ymca rec league?
all right, all right.
gentlemen, we're gonna divide you up into groups and let you play.
point guards on my right. Two-Guards on my left.
forwards and centers, other end of the court.
show us what you got.
let's go, fellas.
Two-Guards over here.
I'm trying out as a point guard.
okay. But you ever played the point?
well, I've never played point guard in my life.
you better learn, beause you're too short to play the two in the pros.
bro, you 6'2."
and I was also 12 hours away from being an NBA lottery pick, you idiot.
well, I'm glad you had the accident, beause you sure wouldn't have made it.
you got to move to the point. -You're out of your mind!
you realize nobody's ever told me this before?
well, I'm telling you now, all right?
and anyways, man, they all get their commission when you sign.
ain't like nobody gonna risk their 10% by telling you the truth.
now, look, Nate.
yo, if you can make it by playing against tall guys at the two, man, all good.
but if you can't, we work on your handle,
we work on your quickness, and we make damn sure
you got the best shot of playing pro ball.
why are you doing this for me, q?
this ain't just your dream, man.
let's work on that left.
numbers are funny.
they can measure you, time you, analyze you all they want,
but they all know what really matters is how you play the game.
he think I've lost a step because of my accident,
so he's gonna play me tight.
I haven't.
now he'll back off because he doesn't want to get beat off the dribble.
just a half step.
that's a mistake.
you ever heard the expression "they can't measure heart"?
well, the truth is, they can't measure any of it ...
heart, want, need.
they think I can't play point guard.
but q knew I could.
you can't measure a dream.
mouth, you made it.
here, you better catch up.
you're like the devil. You know that?
no, just devilish.
what's that?
just a little going-away present.
Oh, it's the t-shirt I slept in
after I thew up and passed out in your bed.
Oh, it's so sweet.
you never told me how you got me into this t-Shirt, Mouth.
maybe sometime you can get me out of it.
is this your first script?
Yeah.
don't worry. I'll fix i...
uh, is there something wrong with it?
no.
I love it.
I said I love it, and I love it.
a couple thoughts, that's all.
okay, like what?
all right, clear your head, all right?
what if Haley...
dies?
you're serious? - I'm saying think about it.
people love that stuff. Man, Dicaprio died in "titanic.
that is gold, baby, gold!
Yes, but it didn't happen.
it doesn't matter. Let me ask you this. Who goes to see this movie?
the same little bitches who went and saw "titanic.
young girls, man.
they don't have a voice,
but when they find something that speaks to them,
we're talking box office, baby! You're king of the world!
even so,
Haley can't just die.
you got a vision.
I can respect that.
what about this?
what if Lucas and Haley get married?
I'm serious about this one, beause if there's one thing that I know,
it's that audiences get crazy over who ends up together.
it's what I do, Luke.
it's what I know.
think about it.
I thought about it.
and I'm not interested.
you couldn't have told me that over the phone?
well, that, yeah, but the rest of this I wanted to say to your face.
I don't trust you...
not with Peyton, and definitely not with Sam.
and that is not gonna get you anywhere ... the grin.
I'm sure it's gotten you in a lot of doors and in a lot of beds,
but it's not gonna do you any good with me.
listen, brooke, when I make a movie,
I set the bar as high as I possibly can.
I put together my wish-list cast, my wish-list crew, my wish-list designer,
and sometimes, you know, the timing works out, the material works out, and you get lucky.
sometimes you don't.
good luck with everything.
I didn't listen to it.
I write my own songs.
Mia, I am not in the best mood right now,
and so it is a very bad time for you to make some naive little stand.
you think I'm naive?
Peyton, I am not the same girl who left on tour last year, okay?
God, I hope that's not true, because I liked that girl.
as a matter of fact, I loved that girl.
Oh, really? Then what happened to protecting her?
what happened to telling the label to be patient, because my songs are gonna be great?
Oh, I've been doing that!
I have been doing that for months now!
but what happened to actually doing the work, Mia?
now, the label wants you to record this song because they care.
when they stop caring, that's when we have a problem.
well, I'm not gonna do it.
you are being so ungrateful! Do you understand?
I put my ass on the line for you every single day!
well, I put my ass on the line for you
every single night, Peyton.
okay? Literally.
did you see how short that skirt was that you put me in at the U.S.O. Show?
but I did it.
I've done everything you've asked me to do, but I am not gonna do this.
Hey.
I'm not sure you should be on this label anymore.
life's too short.
trust me.
man, Madison's really killing it.
I knew I should've told jokes.
seriously. You're hosed.
Hi. - Hey!
you smell like alcohol.
Really? - Yeah.
is it bad? - No.
do you have any with you?
no.
Hey! Look who we found!
Hey!
Hi, Mouth. -Hey, baby.
how did it go?
I did what my son told me to ... the best I could.
here he comes! - He looks so cute!
he's nervous.
Hi, my name is James Lucas Scott,
and I'm gonna play "the first noel.
he's just got to get past this first part, and he'll be good.
Oh, no.
this is awkward.
how's everyone doing tonight?
last week, my mom asked me how I liked going to school.
I told her, "not as much as I like coming home from it.
and seriously, what's with the cafeteria food?
I mean, I can't tell if kids are out sick from eating that stuff,
or we're actually eating the kids who are out sick.
take my hot lunch...please.
and now, the big finish.
something like that. What do you want from me? I'm 5.
thank you and good night!
should've gone to Jamie's talent show with Brooke.
you're kidding, right?
I like them. They're nice to me.
I think it's funny how you stole from Brooke Davis and called her a bitch, - And now you like her. - I was pissed off. So what?
What'd you say after she caught you shoplifting?
you said she was a rich bitch and someone should put her in her place.
so?
you said someone should put her in her place, Sam.
so, tell me again why Lucas has to end up with Peyton.
because they do.
because that's the story. Because that's what happened.
it's a movie! Got to raise the stakes.
kill off one of the younger characters.
Hello?
Hi, doctor. It's me.
well, what does that mean?
what's wrong?
after you caught me shoplifting,
I was with my friends,
and I said some terrible things about you.
okay.
Sam, what happened?
well ... - don't, please. Just don't.
but I didn't mean them. I didn't ...
I didn't mean any of it.
but...
Sam, I'm sorry. I don't understand.
the attack it was my fault.
bourbon is a good, honest drink, you know?
classier than whiskey.
less of a stick up its ass than Scotch.
I'm an alcoholic.
has Sam been in here tonight?
no. Why? What's wrong?
we had a ... a thing
and she left and I let her go and I shouldn't have.
it's okay. Here, have a seat.
no, I have to find her.
Brooke, come on, she's a teenager.
she's not even your teenager.
and what is that supposed to mean?
I'll let you two...
Julian, if she calls you ...
it's not my problem.
look...
I just mean it's not like she's gonna stay with you forever, right?
what is wrong with you?
I came here because I need your help.
but, I mean, you know Sam. She'll turn up.
no
it's different this time.
but with you, it's exactly the same.
Hey, brooke!
that's not fair.
I have to find her!
but I'll do it by myself, just like I always do.
don't call me anymore.
so, how about we rent a movie, and then we can ...
I was looking for the number for the pizza place.
Oh, no. No, no, Millie, it's not ...
it's not what it looks like?
this isn't a half-naked picture of your ex-girlfriend in one of your t-shirts?
she sent it to me tonight. It was a joke.
Millie, please. There is nothing going on between us, I swear.
I-I was gonna delete it. - But you didn't.
you know what?
you're an idiot.
Millie, don't go, please.
it doesn't mean anything.
you're wrong, Marvin.
it means everything.
how funny was your son tonight?
Oh, he was goofy, like his mom.
I think he was brave, like his dad.
so, what's next with our comeback?
well, what's next is the phone's gonna ring,
and the answer is either gonna be a yes or a no.
it's going to be a yes.
I hope so.
but if it's a no, then this is the end of it,
and I'm okay with that.
rough night, Millie?
horrible.
Yeah, me, too.
you know I haven't had a drink in over eight years?
tonight, that's gonna change.
I haven't had sex in over 22 years.
and tonight, that's gonna change.
thank you.
Hey. - Hey, any luck?
uh, no. Are you looking for her, too?
I'm not that guy, Brooke. I'm just getting coffee. Sorry.
excuse me. I'm looking for someone ...
a young girl that comes in here a lot.
she's kind of a skater, sarcastic.
let me guess.
her name is Sam, and she puts a lot of sugar in her coffee.
you've seen her?
no, but that cute guy that just left asked me the same exact thing.
Thanks.
and then he got worried, and he backed off just a half step.
so, what do you think I did?
pulled up for 3 ... nothing but net.
that's right.
you know, I'm proud of you, buddy.
you took something that would've beaten most people,
and you kept going with it.
you turned it into something great.
so did you, daddy.
all right, Chris Rock, I know you're still wired,
but it's time for bed.
how about a nursery rhyme?
okay.
but you're gonna have to read it.
you want an old-school, creepy one, or a new, good-for-you one?
old-school creepy. - Okay.
okay.
there...
There...Gentle.
a man of words and not of deeds
is like a garden full of weeds.
and when the weeds begin to grow,
it's like a garden full of snow.
and when the snow begins to fall,
it's like a bird upon the wall.
and when the bird away does fly,
it's like an eagle in the sky.
and when the sky begins to roar,
it's like a lion at the door.
Hi.
I have to tell you something.
and when the door begins to crack,
it's like a stick across your back.
and when your back begins to smart...
Hey. You okay?
...It's like a penknife in your heart.
Sam, this is my brother, "x.
have a nice night?
have a bad night?
and when your heart begins to bleed, "You're dead...
and dead...
so, about the director, what do you want?
I want a director that understands the characters.
I mean, that's what this movie's really about.
take a seat. - Get comfortable, 15.
get real comfortable.
Hey. uh, is Peyton around?
no. - You wouldn't by chance know how to make a long island iced tea, would you?
so, when's this thing with you and Brooke gonna happen?
Brooke and I are working together.
I think you like her.
do not. - Do too.
this has to be business, right?
I mean, with Peyton and...
this should be business.
we can't just...
I mean, I kiss you, and then it gets
definitely. it would be.
it would be.
Yes.
this is Charleston Chiefs basketball,
and we've got a close one.
the chiefs trail by one with 10 seconds left on the clock.
okay, guys, this is it, last play.
we're gonna go four- out swing rattle.
spread the defense and isolate 23 at the top of the key.
Devon, you're gonna break down your man.
if you get doubled up,
you hit Rhodes cutting under the basket.
I got this.
all right. Here we go.
everybody knows where they're supposed to be.
let's get "chiefs" on 3, - 1, 2, 3. - Chiefs!
you know where you're supposed to be, 12?
let's go! let's go, baby! I got this!
what? Aw, come on!
let's go, guys! Bring it home!
here we go. 10 seconds left.
chiefs down by one.
...10 seconds left.
chiefs do get the ball inbounds...?
they try to get the ball to Devon Fox.
fox is the hot man. Tonight He's got 33 points.
he's the guy who walks with the ball.
moving left. He's...? - Give it up! Give it up!
4 seconds left.
and Rhodes breaks free under the knee!
but Fox shots the ball instead.
it's nothing but air and it's no good!
and the Chiefs lose a heartbreaker.
Yeah, I know.
who saw me throw down that windmill in the third quarter, huh?
it was sick!
somebody better put that on a poster.
that's all I'm saying.
you do realize we lost the game.
no. You lost.
I had 33 points.
that's funny. Last time I checked, it's a team sport.
you don't get it.
see, the nba only scouts players who put up big numbers.
tonight I did that, so I won!
and your ass is only here to keep the bench warm.
Oh, is that right?
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
is there a problem here?
no problem.
just reminding your boy here whose team this is.
Yeah. that's what I thought.
Yeah! Mm! whoo! it's Devon Fox's house!
you know, there is this amazing invention called the dishwasher.
Yeah. It's called "me.
been doing it since I was, what, Jamie's age?
and besides, helps me think.
all right.
so, besides having a pregnant fiance,
what's going on in that head?
Ah, it's the movie.
Julian and I have met with five different directors.
turned them all down.
tomorrow we're meeting with the sixth.
Oh, yeah. and Julian's dad's coming to town tomorrow.
apparently, he's not happy with how selective I've been.
okay. well, then, maybe director number six will be the one you've been waiting for.
well, they say he is avisionary.
that's a good thing, right?
well, yeah.
unless his vision is different than mine.
this is the first five- game losing streak of my career.
I think I like winning better.
you didn't lose, daddy. Those losers did!
Wah,
somebody's a little fired up.
Yeah. you should have seen him 20 minutes ago.
you know what, Jamie?
I wear that uniform just like they do,
so doesn't matter if I'm playing or not,
it's still my team.
we win as a team, and we lose as a team.
remember that, okay?
okay.
you okay?
I am now.
good. let's get you home.
this is so wrong.
but it's so right.
what am I gonna tell Peyton?
I can't be on the couch, kissing you.
well, ok, then maybe we should just continue this in your bedroom,
preferably without our clothes.
we can't.
I gave Sam a very strict "no boys in the bedroom" policy,
and I can't be one of those hypocrite moms.
hasn't Sam already broken that rule like five times?
once.
okay, then that means you're allowed to break it once.
it's only fair, right?
no.
that grin should be illegal.
this is bad.
but it's good.
OK,
en, well, just so I'm clear on these newly amended rules,
I'm not allowed to have boys in the bedroom,
but it's okay if I fool around with them out here on the couch. Is that correct?
I think you should repeal the "no boys in the bedroom" rule.
you stay out of this.
I'm with Julian.
you're killing me, Sam. - I know.
I'll have my headphones on tonight, just in case.
good night.
Oh, my god.
it's not funny!
okay. okay, maybe we should just continue this in your bedroom, preferably
without our clothes.
Yeah.
right.
should I be following you?
I'll just let myself out.
tell me what you see.
where is the soul hidden within this image?
I don't know what that means.
I think he's talking to himself.
I'm just curious,
but what the hell are we doing in a junkyard?
there. That's Lucas' house.
it's perfect.
no, no. It's, uh
I didn't grow up here.
you know, I actually had a pretty normal house.
boring! There's no drama in normal.
I'm going for "8 mile" here. I want gritty.
I'm thinking the entire movie should be shot with a handheld-camera.
look, Pete, we want to keep in mind this is a true story.
you know, it's okay to have a vision, we love that.
we just don't want to rewrite history here.
this is the only place
I can see our climactic scene happening!
this is the spot where Lucas' rival gang kills his uncle Keith in a drive-by shooting!
okay. I'm done here.
so, doc, tell me the truth.
what are the chances of another heart becoming available?
same as they were before, not great.
well, that's comforting.
don't give up hope.
just remember, even with those odds the last time,
we were able to find you a heart.
and it ended up going to someone else.
Yes. It saved a man's life.
well, we could just ask for it back,
tell him we had dibs.
I'm afraid not.
didn't think so.
I said, "shut up"!
just do yourself a favor.
this time when it goes off, call us.
okay.
I'll try to avoid being kidnapped by some crazy bitch.
all you can do now is wait.
Devon makes that pass, we win the game.
maybe.
I wanted to talk to you about playing time.
Nathan, you've been here five minutes.
you're still learning the offense,
not to mention a new position.
I know.
and if the team were winning,
we wouldn't be having this conversation.
you play the same position as the best player on this team.
Devon scored 33 points last night.
and he had one assist,
and that was off of an air ball they called a pass.
look, the job of the point guard is to get the rest of the team involved.
so, unless he learns to pass the ball,
this team's gonna keep losing.
I- I've seen it before.
you know what you sounded like just then?
a coach.
but you turned down that job, remember?
just gonna have to wait your turn, Nate.
here.
take this.
that's some of our new offensive sets.
we'll see how they sink in,
then maybe we'll talk about some playing time.
my number's in there if you have any questions.
Yeah.
Thanks, coach.
is that a new hat?
Yeah. Why?
no reason.
am I not pulling it off?
Nah, it's fine.
no. If it was fine, you wouldn't have mentioned it.
it would just blend in.
okay. Let's hear it.
what was wrong with this director?
too short? Too tall?
too idiot.
this is getting old, Lucas.
no, dad. Lucas is right. This guy was not a good fit.
Julian, you've been calling me "Paul" since you were 15,
so don't start with the "dad" crap now.
look, These directors that you've sent us,
they are all extremely talented, all right? They are.
they're just not what we're looking for.
well, I'm sorry to hear that.
it's time for me to step in.
I have sent you six directors.
any one of them could make this movie.
so it's real simple. Pick one.
I don't care which one it is.
because if you don't, then I'm gonna take that stupid hat off of Julian's head and I'm gonna put all six choices inside of it and I'm gonna reach in and I'm gonna choose your director for you.
now, if you don't like that idea,
you have until tomorrow to decide for yourself.
understood?
I'm still trying to figure out
how I ended up with such a talented wife.
you just got lucky.
no. getting lucky's how I got a son.
how'd it go with the coach?
it looks like I won't be playing any time soon.
Aw. Sorry, Nate.
it's okay.
I think you and Jamie should skip the next few games, though.
I don't want to let him down.
let him down? You're his hero.
exactly. I...
it can't be easy to watch your hero sit on the bench.
maybe we go to those games to support you, whether you play or not.
and besides it's important for our son to see you not giving up.
maybe you're right.
I am.
besides, we're a team, right?
we win together, and we lose together.
right.
where did you disappear to last night?
I was waiting for you in my bed.
that's not funny.
Yes, it is.
check it out. For the movie.
what do you think?
very authentic.
well, not yet.
I have to age them down a little
and put some patches on them,
but I've had some experience with letterman jackets.
I'm sure you have.
like you didn't have all the girls in highschool just begging to wear yours?
no, I didn't play sports in high school.
I never had a letterman jacket.
Really?
well,
now you do.
did you make this for me? - Yep.
and look at that.
you lettered all four years in football.
not bad for someone who never played sports.
Thanks, Brooke.
you're welcome.
I'll see you later.
okay.
hay. - See you ...?
really, Brooke?
what? - You two are totally having sex!
no, we're not. - You so are!
I can sense it!
well, then, your senses are off,
because we are not having sex.
and how much would you hate me if we were?
no, I wouldn't hate you. I mean, I know how he is.
he's smart, and he's charming, he gets into a lot of beds with that little scoundrel grin of his.
Yeah, I know that grin.
all right, well, there's something else you should know.
the weekend that he broke up with me,
he just jumped into bed with somebody else, okay?
he flew off to Sundance, slept with some actress before I could even wipe away the tears, you know?
it was all in the tabloids.
and that's when I realized what a bad guy he is.
you know, I just couldn't figure it out until then.
so I want you to be careful, all right?
cause the second this movie's over,
he's gonna be off on another movie with a new conquest.
and before you know it,
that charming guy with the sweet grin disappears.
that's just who he is.
I'm coming.
what are you doing?
Haley, will you marry me?
that is so creepy on so many levels.
Yeah, well, that's how that, uh, crazy director in l. a.
wanted to end the movie.
Seriously? - Yeah.
do you think Peyton will like it?
I don't know, Luke. Girls usually hate getting big diamonds.
I think she'll love it.
it's just, I...
I always pictured you giving her Keith's ring.
it meant so much to you.
the truth is, is I always hoped she'd wear that ring, too.
so why did you buy this one?
well, because I gave Keith's ring to Lindsey.
she gave it back to you.
Yeah. I just wasn't sure if she'd want it after that.
so I figured, you know, couldn't go wrong with a new ring.
all right. oh, Luke, it's stuck.
well, I guess I'll just have to keep it now. Sorry.
did you forget something?
no. I just couldn't stay away.
is everything okay?
Yes.
no.
I don't know.
well, which is it, "yes," "no," or, "I don't know"?
I don't know.
look, the last thing that I want to do is make it awkward between us,
but I need to know something.
is this going anywhere?
this conversation? I have no idea.
I'm completely lost.
I'm being serious, Julian.
this, you and me,
what are we, what are we doing?
I don't know. We're hanging out. We're having fun.
right.
pretty much what I expected your answer to be.
what's wrong with having fun?
nothing.
and in the past, I would have been fine with a fling.
and I'm sorry that you missed out on that version of me.
but my situation has changed.
I'm really trying to set a good example for Sam,
and I just don't know how to explain "just having fun" to her.
so this is about Sam.
Sam, me
does it really matter?
I mean, we both know you're gonna leave when the movie's over.
there it is.
okay.
well, maybe we should just slow it down,
focus on the movie.
and by "slow down," you mean "slam on the brakes."
Brooke, it sounds to me like you slammed on the brakes before I came in here.
but you know what? It's okay. Whatever you want it to be.
what's that, grandpa?
that's the thing that makes noise when it's time for me to get better.
when is it supposed to make the noise?
wish I knew.
me too.
so, tell me, how's your dad?
he finally made the team, but he never gets to play.
the team's not very good. They always lose.
well, that's okay.
he always rises to the top, you know?
it's not just about x's and o's. It's about heart, and your dad has plenty of that.
so don't worry.
did you hear that? I think it made a sound.
not just yet, buddy.
but when it does, you'll be the first to know.
eat your ice cream. - Okay.
I want to play a song for you.
cool. Let's hear it.
but this is good, too.
all right. I'm gonna go sit over there in a second.
go play me your song, goof.
okay.
so, I'm a little nervous.
I thought you did this for a living.
Yeah, but this is different.
no one's ever heard this before.
so I'm gonna be your first.
we'll see.
so, remember when we were talking the other night about flying over a city
and how things look different from a distance?
well, you kind of inspired me to write this.
so, promise you'll lie and say you love it if you hate it.
I can do that. I can be a good liar for you.
well, hopefully, you won't have to be.
we're stopping. why are we stopping?
look where we are.
Luke, it's our spot.
we haven't been here in years!
I have.
when you were in L.A. I used to come here sometimes.
we're using this as a location in the movie.
pretty good moment in our relationship.
Yeah. it was the beginning.
you were so cute in your little tow truck.
Yeah, and you were so mean to me. Remember?
first of all, you don't know me.
second of all, you don't know me.
and in my defense, you really didn't know me.
Oh, yes, I did.
I always knew you.
I have something for you.
now, we're already engaged, So I don't know if I'm supposed to get down on one knee, but
Oh, my god. Is that for me?
Yes.
do you like it?
are you kidding? It's beautiful.
I am so glad you always knew me.
Wah, It's a good thing to see you haven't lost your shooting touch.
so, I heard your team's lost five straight.
I know how that feels.
actually, I don't.
did you come here just to rub it in?
no. I came to tell you that losing has its advantages.
here we go.
some classic Dan Scott advice that doesn't apply to normal people.
I'm all ears. What do you got for me?
losing always forces change, Nathan.
your time's coming.
I don't know about that.
best guy on the team plays in front of me.
Oh, you know what I call the best player on a losing team.
a loser. - Bingo. A loser.
right now, you're playing on his team,
but pretty soon, he's gonna be playing on yours.
I'm not so sure about that.
you're gonna get your chance, Nathan.
we both know that.
the thing is, when you do, will you be ready?
will you make the most of it?
see this?
this thing's gonna decide whether or not I get a second chance.
and I promise you
if I do, I'm gonna make the most of it.
right now, all you can do is wait.
can I help you?
Paul! hi! - hey.
Oh, god, I was hoping I was gonna see you while you were in town!
your assistant let me in. - My assistant?
Yeah, Mia. Cute little brunette.
Oh, god, no. That's not my assistant.
that, um, that is just an overly trusting recording artist.
it's a good thing you're not a serial killer.
we actually have those here in Tree Hill.
I heard.
so, look at you.
you've become this big success.
and most importantly, you look happy.
I'm kind of having a good day.
Oh. Not bad.
Lucas has good taste in jewelry and fiances.
his taste in directors, however, is still in question.
I am staying way out of that argument.
that's probably a good idea.
it's good to see you, Peyton.
how long has it been?
I mean, it was before Sundance.
um, god, that was hard to forget.
I spent that whole weekend crying.
you know, my son has made a few mistakes in his life,
but letting you get away easily tops the list.
the breakup was not hard on Julian.
he was fine.
in fact, I remember reading about him and that little a- list actress of his that weekend in Sundance.
Peyton, you can't believe everything you read in Hollywood, you know that.
Paul, are you covering for him?
actually, no, because I planed that story.
I was trying to promote a movie.
Julian didn't even go to Sundance.
he skipped his own movie premiere,
he was so heartbroken.
to be honest, I'm not sure he's ever fully recovered.
nice digs you got here.
do you really think one of these guys can make this movie?
they can all make the movie. The question is, which one of them will screw it up the least.
so that's our goal here?
find the best of the worst, huh?
that is the plan, yes.
fair enough. So, who's your first choice?
all right, hear me out, 'cause you're gonna think I'm a little crazy,
but I got to go with the british director.
Really?
the guy made an incest movie with sock puppets.
Yeah, but you got to admit, it had a certain style to it.
and tell me you wouldn't want to see
a little sock- puppet Lucas.
come on, admit it.
what are you doing, daddy?
just doing a little homework.
there's homework in basketball?
sure, there is.
when I get on the court, I want to be ready, right?
do you think you're ever gonna play?
I hope so. It's up to the coach, though.
is he mean?
no, he's not mean. He's just...
just doing what he thinks is best for the team.
you know what? I have an idea.
why don't you help me learn some of these plays?
I could really use your help.
Really? Okay, I'll help.
awesome. Come here. all right, see this play?
that's called a four- out swing rattle, all right?
that's when four players,
so, you can't play until the coach wants you to?
Yeah. I just have to wait until then.
all right. So, this play, I'm just gonna come down here,
and I'm going to dribble this way.
Hey. I want one of those.
well, I will make you one,
but you are just gonna have to wait.
Julian didn't have to wait.
is that what he told you, that I didn't make him wait?
no, I came to that conclusion when he showed me his new jacket.
Oh. Right.
Brooke, are you and Julian,
no, not at all.
okay, up until today, we were " having fun,"
his words, not mine, but it ended before it started.
he didn't tell you? - No.
since I don't really like Julian,
we try to keep our conversations strictly about the movie.
right. How is that going?
Oh, well, the director I met today wanted to make Lucas a gang member and have him living in a junkyard. Yeah.
sounds gritty?
Oh, but he did want to put Brooke in a mansion in Charlotte.
now, that is a movie I would go see.
Luke You don't have to compromise,
not if you don't want to.
the worst thing that could happen is for this movie to fail
because they went with someone else's vision.
what do I do, Brooke?
do whatever it takes.
just make sure they tell the story the way you remember it.
come in! - Mama, I need to use the phone.
well, okay, but who are you calling, little man?
guess what I'm holding!
it looks like a CD.
Oh, it is, but what's on it?
it's Mia's new song.
since when does Mia have a new song?
since now. It's great.
give it!
Hi, this is Jamie Scott. We need to talk.
Oh, I see Lucas gave you the ring!
what, you knew about it?
Yeah. He proposed to me with it first, but I just had to turn him down.
Oh. Lucky me.
well, it's definitely beautiful.
you don't sound very convincing.
no, I love it. I do.
I just, I always envisioned wearing Keith's ring.
okay, I'm gonna tell you something, and you have to swear that you did not hear it from me.
I promise.
Lucas really wanted to give you Keith's ring.
he just thought you wouldn't want it
since he already gave it to Lindsey.
so, you see, it's not all about x's and o's.
it's about heart.
I just think you should really think about that.
I will. You have a good night, Jamie.
I thought we agreed on the brit.
well, I changed my mind.
well, Paul wants an answer today.
he'll get one.
well, what are we gonna tell him?
I haven't exactly figured that out yet, okay?
Oh, okay. Well, when you do figure it out,
you think maybe you could give me a heads- up?
I'm only the producer of the movie.
who's this?
you've got to be kidding me.
Lucas Scott, you son of a bitch!
Thanks, Argyle. Hang tight.
my name is Jason.
rent "Die Hard." It'll change your life.
what are you doing here, Adam?
my agent tells me you guys are still having some trouble finding a director for this movie.
I thought maybe I would come by and give you two dorks another chance.
I have a surprise for you.
think I finally perfected the long island iced tea.
that took a little longer than it should have.
just saying.
promise me one thing?
even if you hate it, you'll lie and say you love it.
okay.
it's good.
not great.
I'm just kidding. I love it.
but I'm also underage, and before I get you arrested,
I think you should probably get back to the bar right after I kiss you again.
I think you've perfected that, too.
okay. I know what you guys are thinking.
you're thinking about fast food, beer, and getting laid.
that's pretty much what I was thinking.
it's like he read my mind.
I respect that! I do. I respect that.
but you guys are also thinking about your movie.
and I didn't fly all the way out here
just so I could nail some flight attendant on the plane
even though I did that.
how'd she look?
solid six, but that's not important.
what's important
is why I should be directing this film.
now, Lucas, you wrote a good script, but that's not enough.
what you two need is a director, someone who can take your vision and translate it onto the big screen, baby!
a director who knows when a scene isn't working,
a director who can adapt to any situation.
gentlemen, that's what I do.
that's what I know.
bottom line, the three of us are gonna get more ass than a toilet seat in Yankee Stadium.
are you finished?
depends if I have the job or not.
okay, um
let me tell you why you're not gonna direct this movie.
because you can't identify with this world.
I mean, I want a director
who can re- create the feeling that I get
every time I step out onto the river court at night.
I want someone who can explain to the audience
why one song can instantly change Peyton's mood,
someone who can recognize that there are two completely different sides to Brooke Davis, both of which are amazing.
I want a director who can make the little things the big things.
and you are just not the guy to do that.
Hi.
I suck.
true, but why this time?
okay, all that stuff that I told you about Julian,
I just found out that some of my facts were not entirely accurate.
like which facts?
pretty much all of them.
he didn't go and sleep with some other girl the weekend we broke up.
in fact, he missed his own movie premiere.
so it seems there is a possibility that Julian really is the nice guy
I thought he was after all.
well, thank you for that, but none of that changes the fact that you and I have been through way too much for me to violate the girl code now.
Oh, my god, Brooke. "girl code"?
I'm engaged to your ex- boyfriend.
you are so exempt from the girl code,
it's not even funny.
Hey, Devon, you got a second?
want an autograph, 12, wait till after the game.
you're going heads-up with Alex Beck tonight.
he's a good defender. Quick hands.
I'm gonna eat that fool up.
I hope so, but he's leading the league in steals.
you usually go right off the dribble.
he's gonna be ready for that.
are you giving me tips?
I'm just trying to give you an advantage.
I already got an advantage.
it's called my god-given talent.
so go sit on the bench and enjoy the show.
okay. You do your thing.
but after he picks your pocket a few times,
you might want to switch to your left.
so, who's the lucky one, Lucas?
well, first off, I just want you to know that we have given this a lot of thought.
that being said, we've decided to choose none of them.
not the answer that I wanted to hear.
I know.
so you know what I have to do now, right?
look, I just,
I just believe we can do better.
that may be true, but time's up.
well, this feels like dejavu all over again.
we're all tied up. Nine seconds left.
let's bring it in. let's bring it in.
this is it. Time's up. Tie game. Last play.
here's what we're gonna do.
Rhodes, set a high screen for Devon.
hit your spot.
Devon, you're gonna find Rhodes cutting across the lane.
you get him the ball.
wait. you're calling the play for Rhodes?
Devon, everybody in the building thinks you're taking the last shot.
that's because I am!
I'm here to put the ball in the basket.
you're here to help this team win.
whatever.
look, I'm taking the lost shot, or I'm taking a seat.
your call.
okay. Take a seat.
Scott, you're in.
you know where you're supposed to be?
Yes, sir. Know exactly where I'm supposed to be.
what I want to hear. Let's run this play.
let's get "win" on 3, 1, 2, 3.
win!
Jamie, look. Daddy's going in!
Yeah!! - Wah!
appreciate you meeting me.
you got two minutes.
tell me why you should direct this movie.
my movies have made a lot of money for a lot of studios, including yours.
but I look at my resume?
and there's something missing.
I've yet to make that one quality movie,
the one I'm proud of.
I think this can be that movie.
and...
because I identify with this world.
I understand the feeling Lucas gets
every time he steps on the river court at night.
I can show the audience how a song can instantly change Peyton's mood.
I recognize that there are two completely different sides to Brooke Davis, both of which are amazing.
I want to make the little things the big things, Paul.
I'm the guy to do it.
I hope you don't mind me coming.
I kind of had a feeling about tonight.
well, I didn't exactly light up the box score.
zero points, zero rebounds
one assist.
best star of the night.
you know, I knew you'd make it.
and I know I don't get to be part of it
but I am so proud of you, son.
Hey.
can I talk to you?
Yeah,
sure. Is everything okay?
come here.
what's up?
I can't accept this ring.
I mean, it's beautiful, and I love it.
I just, it's not the ring that I want to wear.
I always dreamed I'd be wearing Keith's ring,
and I know how much it means to you,
so that's the ring I want to wear for the rest of my life.
you sure?
now it's right where it belongs.
and it will be forever.
Hi.
I want you to have this.
and what is this supposed to mean?
it means we're going steady.
this isn't a game, Julian.
I know.
when I first got here,
everyone thought I came for a girl,
the girl in the book.
but I only came here to make a movie.
but now it turns out everyone was right.
I am here for the girl in the book,
the other girl.
maybe we should continue this in my bedroom - Preferably without our clothes. - Preferably without our clothes.
you son of a bitch!
what do you want, Reese?
I just wanted to come by and give you the good news myself.
I'm directing the movie.
done! I signed on tonight!
you and I are gonna have some fun.
Oh, I've got a couple thoughts about that last scene.
don't worry about it. We'll talk tomorrow,
partner.
for YOU, MISS LAUREN.
Oh, WOW. THANK YOU, JAMIE.
they're FROM MY UNCLE SKILLS. HE THINKS YOU'RE CUTE.

...and BE KIND TO HIM.
just PLEASE...
...do THAT FOR ME.
Peyton, WHAT IS THIS?
I JUST THOUGHT I SHOULD.
no. NO, YOU...
you SAID EVERYTHING WAS GONNA BE OKAY.
you SAID THAT.
okay, BUT, LUKE, IF IT ISN'T,
I WANT OUR CHILD TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER ME.
it's JUST IN CASE.
our CHILD'S NOT GONNA HAVE TO REMEMBER YOU.
our CHILD'S GONNA KNOW YOU.
we're NOT DOING THIS, PEYTON.
a DEATH VIDEO? A SAD BOX OF STUFF?
I'm NOT HAVING ANY OF THIS, PEYTON.
I MEAN, WHAT'S NEXT?
I WANT TO GET MARRIED...
now.
absolutely NOT.
you're SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING IT EASY.
okay, LOOK, AFTER YOU HAVE THIS BABY AND YOU'RE ALL BETTER,
then - THEN WE'LL GET MARRIED.
I WANT TO GET MARRIED. WHY?
why IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO DO IT NOW?
because
we're NOT DOING ANYTHING JUST IN CASE, OKAY?
I'll BE IN THE GARAGE.
you SHOULD BE IN BED.
thank YOU!
I LOVE YOU, TOO, BY THE WAY.
remind ME AGAIN WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE?
know THY ENEMY, BROOKE.
EW.
suit YOURSELF, BUT THIS IS OUR COMPETITION,
and THEY'RE CUTTING INTO OUR MARKET SHARE

Yeah, THE APPROPRIATE WORD BEING "HIDEOUS.
don't BE SO DISMISSIVE.
maybe YOU SHOULD PAY A VISIT TO THE MANUFACTURER,
get SOME INSPIRATION.
I HAVE SAM, AND SAM HAS SCHOOL,
so I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
besides, I NEED TO BE HERE
while SHE'S MEETING WITH... YOU KNOW WHO.
you MEAN THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER
with THE PATHETICALLY LOW CREDIT SCORE?
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
so, I HAD BUSINESS AFFAIRS RUN HER CREDIT REPORT.
don't HATE ME BECAUSE I'M RESOURCEFUL.
you DID WHAT?
Brooke, WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO
make A CASE AGAINST THE WOMAN.
we ARE NOT BUILDING A CASE AGAINST ANYONE.
do YOU THINK THAT I CAN'T SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
there IS NO RUNNING FROM THIS.
Sam HAS EVERY RIGHT TO KNOW HER... REAL MOM.
suit YOURSELF.
red IS REALLY YOUR COLOR.
what DO YOU THINK?
do YOU THINK WE'RE SHOPPING RIGHT NOW?
absolutely NOT.
this IS STRICTLY R&D FOR OUR NEW LINE.

everything OKAY?
it's PEYTON.
I- I-I FOUND HER PUTTING TOGETHER A TIME CAPSULE,
or A - A "JUST IN CASE" CAPSULE.
Oh.
that's WHAT I THOUGHT.
I KNOW, YEAH.
it's JUST, YOU KNOW, WEIRD
that I'M APPROACHING WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
the MOST EXCITING MOMENT OF MY ENTIRE LIFE
with NOTHING BUT... COMPLETE AND UTTER FEAR.
you WANT TO HEAR A SECRET?
day JAMIE WAS BORN, I WAS... PETRIFIED.
no, YOU KNOW, IT'S DIFFERENT, THOUGH, YOU KNOW?
I MEAN, WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO PEYTON?
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GOT THIS FAR.
well, YOU GOT THIS FAR 'CAUSE IT'S WHAT SHE WANTED.
you KNOW?
it's LIKE WHEN KAREN LET YOU PLAY BASKETBALL WITH YOUR HCM.
she KNEW HOW BAD YOU WANTED IT,
so SHE JUST HELD HER BREATH AND LET YOU PLAY.
we ALL DID, YOU KNOW?
maybe - MAYBE THIS IS THE TIME
you HAVE TO HOLD YOUR BREATH FOR PEYTON.
she WANTS TO GET MARRIED.
so DO YOU. YOU PROPOSED, REMEMBER?
she WANTS TO GET MARRIED RIGHT AWAY. OH.
it ALL JUST WORRS ME.
well, AS WORRIED AS YOU ARE,
think ABOUT HOW SCARED SHE IS.
look, IF YOU HAD ONE MORE DAY TO SPEND WITH PEYTON,
would YOU RATHER SPEND IT ARGUING
or JUST BEING MARRIED?
Hey. YOU READY?
for WHAT?
Peyton's BABY SHOWER. YOU DIDN'T FORGET, DID YOU?
sure SHE WANTS ME THERE?
of COURSE I'M SURE.
the INVITATION WAS ADDRESSED TO BOTH OF US, YOU KNUCKLEHEAD.
are YOU OKAY, SAM?
Yeah, I'M GOOD.
okay.
so, EVERYTHING'S GOING OKAY WITH, YOU KNOW...
my MOM?
Yeah.
what DO YOU GOT THERE?
...It's HER HOUSE.
you OW, SHE GAVE ME UP WHEN SHE WAS MY AGE.
how WEIRD IS THAT?
Yeah.
she SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT TO,
but HER PARENTS MADE HER DO IT.
well, I CAN RELATE
to HAVING CRUMMY PARENTS WHO MAKE BAD DECISIONS.
Yeah.
you KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.
I've ALWAYS... WANTED TO LIVE IN A HOUSE
with A WHITE PICKET FENCE.
well, WE CAN HAVE A PICKET FENCE IF YOU WANT.
you CAN HAVE ANY KIND OF FENCE YOU WANT.
I'll JUST WAIT FOR YOU TO GET DRESSED.
you KNOW, IF IT'S OKAY, CAN I JUST MEET YOU THERE?
Yeah.
I'll SEE YOU AT PEYTON'S.
so, THE STAGE IS SET FOR THE CHARLESTON CHIEFS,
who CAN MOVE INTO SOLE POSSESSION OF FIRST PLACE

and WITH THE SEASON COMING TO A CLOSE
and POSSIBLE NBA CALL-UPS HANGING IN THE BALANCE,
coach BOBBY IRONS WILL BE LOOKING
for EXPLOSIVE PERFORMANCES FROM HIS TWO LEADING SCORERS,
nino JONES AND POINT GUARD NATHAN SCOTT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYBODY OUT THERE WOULD WANT YOUR AUTOGRAPH.

Hey, UH, SCOTT, I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO SIT THIS ONE OUT.
I'm SO NOT WEARING THIS.
Sam, IT'S A BABY SHOWER.

so, HOW GOES IT WITH... THE WAITRESS?
her NAME IS REBECCA, THANK YOU.
and FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
things ARE KIND OF GOING OKAY.
Yes, WELL...
I'm sure you conversation ???
I MEAN, YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT,

I THOUGHT SHE'D BE THIS EVIL PERSON, YOU KNOW,
this BAD PERSON THAT GAVE ME UP, BUT SHE'S NOT.
you KNOW, SHE'S GOT HER PROBLEMS,
but SHE'S OKAY.
I MEAN, IN A WAY, SHE'S - SHE'S KIND OF LIKE...
like WHAT?
like ME.
did SHE SAY SHE WANTED YOU BACK?
doesn't MATTER. I'M HAPPY HERE.
and THAT'S WHAT WE WANT FOR YOU, SAMANTHA
to BE HAPPY HERE.
Yeah, I KNOW.
it's JUST, I DON'T WANT TO HURT BROOKE'S FEELINGS,
but PART OF ME WANTS TO KNOW HER, YOU KNOW?
my REAL MOM?
do YOU WANT TO LIVE WITH HER?
no.
of COURSE YOU DON'T.
that's MY GIRL.
now LET'S SEE IF WE CAN'T FIND A BEAUTIFUL DRESS FOR YOU,
worthy OF THE DAVIS NAME.

Hey, SHE LOVES YOU.

I JUST GOT ALL THE PAPERS IN THE MAIL.
Oh, MY GOD, THAT IS SUCH GOOD NEWS.

I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT SAM JUST BECAME
the LUCKIEST GIRL IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

I THINK EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.
Oh, WOW, WHAT IS IT?
it's A BABY MEMORY BOOK,

if YOU GET AN OPEN SHOT, TAKE IT.
the SCOUTS ARE HERE TO WATCH EVERYONE.
and THAT INCLUDES YOU, COACH.
we're GONNA WIN THIS GAME.
I'm NOT ANGRY.
but I WOULD APPRECIATE YOU TALKING TO ME FIRST
before YOU START LAVISHING SAM WITH FANCY CLOTHES.
I THOUGHT SHE LOOKED NICE.
not THE POINT.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SAM.
what ABOUT SAM?
I KNOW YOU CARE FOR HER DEEPLY, AS DO I.
letting HER SPEND TIME WITH HER BIRTH MOTHER
on A MORE PERMANENT BASIS.
and WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?
honey, I'VE BEEN TALKING TO HER.
don't "HONEY" ME. YOU LKED TO HER ABOUT THIS?
this IS NOT YOUR BUSINESS! YOU HAD NO RIGHT!
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT NOTHING GOOD
was GONNA COME OF THE TWO OF YOU SPENDING TIME TOGETHER.
what CAN I SAY? WE GET ALONG.
unlike SOME PEOPLE THAT SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS.
you CAN'T DO THIS.
do WHAT?
try TO BE THE MOTHER TO HER THAT YOU NEVER WERE ME.
last TIME I CHECKED, I WAS STILL YOUR
don't SAY IT.
anyone WHO EVER WANTED TO BE IN MY LIFE
Peyton, BOYS, ANYONE
you TRIED TO PUSH THEM ALL AWAY.
you TRIED TO PUSH EVERYONE AWAY,
and NOW YOU WANT SAM TO LEAVE?
I DON'T WANT SAM TO LEAVE. YES, YOU DO!
it's WHY YOU'RE LYING TO MY FACE RIGHT NOW!
you're JEALOUS BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO BE WITH ME.
well, SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE...
...not IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT.
what's THAT?
adoption PAPERS.
Brooke... BE CAREFUL.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT.
all MY LIFE, YOU HAVE AVOIDED BEING A MOTHER TO ME.
do NOT THINK FOR ONE MOMENT THAT YOU GET TO START NOW.
what's GOING ON?
I DON'T KNOW.
maybe YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR MOTHER.
what WAS THAT ABOUT?
Sam, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING
something... IMPORTAN
you're HAPPY HERE, RIGHT?
Yeah. WHAT'S GOING ON?
I WANT TO ADOPT YOU - FOR REAL.
I WANT TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL AND FOREVER.
I've GIVEN THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT.
I WANT US TO BE A FAMILY.
I KNOW THAT IT'S YOUR DREAM TO HAVE THAT,
and I WANT TO GIVE THAT TO YOU NOW.
so, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
Yeah.
Yeah.
okay.
what?
I CAN STILL SEE MY REAL MOM, RIGHT?
dude, SAVE SOME FOR THE SECOND HALF.
so, YOU NEVER REALLY TALK ABOUT YOUR PAST RELATIONSHIP.
was IT A BAD BREAK-UP?
Yeah, KIND OF.
I MEAN, IN THE END, IT WAS MOSTLY A LIFESTYLE THING.
we JUST DIDN'T SEE EYE TO EYE ON SOME STUFF.
she WAS A GRANDMA.
let's JUST SAY SHE WAS MATURE.
Hey, LOOK, THAT'S COOL.
it's JUST, UM
so WE'RE CLEAR, I PREFER YOUNGER GUYS
younger, BALD, ATHLETIC GUYS WHO LIKE KIDS.
Yeah, WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S FUNNY,
because MY LAST RELATIONSHIP DIDN'T WORK
because I WAS TOO YOUNG, BALD, ATHLETIC.
but I DO LIKE KIDS.
Oh.
mom SAYS I SHOULDN'T EAT DAIRY.
some KIDS. I DO LIKE SOME KIDS.
Oh, NO.
all RIGHT, JIM-JAM, COME ON, BUDDY. WE GOT TO GO.
do I HAVE TO?
Yes. CHOP-CHOP.
if WE HURRY, WE CAN CALL YOUR DAD BEFORE YOUR BEDTIME.
this IS WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON?
don't TELL. IT'S A SURPRISE FOR AUNT PEYTON.
Oh. SORRY.
Hey. HI.
so, UH, HOW WAS THE SHOWER? IS SHE OKAY?
Yeah. YEAH, I THINK SHE REALLY ENJOYED HERSELF.
how ARE YOU DOING? YOU HOLDING UP OKAY?
better NOW.
good. GLAD TO HEAR IT.
all RIGHT, BUDDY, LET'S GO CALL YOUR DAD.
Thanks, UNCLE LUCAS. THAT WAS FUN.
Yeah, IT WAS.
your WHOLE LIFE'S IN THAT BOX. I WISH I HAD ONE.
see YA.
Bye.

Oh, GOD.
Hey.
Hey.

I DON'T THINK IT IS.
Sam, I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS,
and I THINK YOU SHOULD GO
spend SOME TIME WITH YOUR REAL MOM.
you WANT TO, DON'T YOU?
please DON'T HATE ME.
Samantha, I COULD NEVER HATE YOU.
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.
but YOU STAYED FOR ME. YOU...
you LET GO OF JULIAN FOR ME.

and THAT WAS TRUE THEN, AND...
I THINK IT'S TRUE NOW.

played A PRETTY GREAT GAME TONIGHT.
honestly, I'VE NEVER REALLY SEEN HIM AS A POINT GUARD.
but I GOT TO SAY, I WAS IMPRESSED.
kid's GOT A BRIGHT FUTURE.

Hey, WHAT HAPPENED? I THOUGHT YOU WERE
don't SAY IT.

Yeah, THE HOSER KID?
Yeah.

I LOVE YOU, SAM.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
Oh.
Bye. bye.
okay.
Bye.
are YOU CRYING?
no.
it's THIS HORRIBLE MASCARA.
it's JUST - REMIND ME TO SUE THE MANUFACTURER.
it's OUR MASCARA, VICTORIA.
what DO WE DO NOW?
we HAVE OUR WORK TO FOCUS ON.
of COURSE.
Hey, COACH.
have YOU HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE SCOUT?
uh, NO. NO, NOT YET.
but LISTEN, YOU GUYS DID ALL YOU COULD OUT THERE.
and NOW WE JUST WAIT FOR THE PHONE TO RING.
it's GOING TO BE OKAY, HONEY.
I'm FINE.
we HAVE OUR WORK TO FOCUS ON NOW.
there's STILL ONE THING MISSING.
what's THAT?
our WEDDING PHOTO.
Really?
we CAN GET MARRIED RIGHT AWAY?
sure.
only IF THE DOCTOR SAYS IT'S OKAY.
but IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE BABY
or OUR SITUATION OR...
well, ANY DAMN THING.
I WANT YOU TO BE MY WIFE...
cause I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
Brooke Davis, you're under arrest.
wait. Why?!
I am being charged with accounting fraud.
what are they talking about?
these aren't sad tears. They're happy tears.
what is it? - I'm pregnant.
Oh, my...
you found it!
no, you found it. Open it up.
treasure!
I don't think we should keep it.
let's get this buried again.
so you need a bartender.
Alex, your movie just blew up.
but it hasn't been released yet.
so what do you say, bar manager?
want to boss me around?
it's what you do, right? Break up couples?
I plan to make him happier than you ever did.
so you should probably just give up and move on now.
something terrible happened.
and I dreamt that I lost you.
it wasn't a dream.
Hi, Luke.
Nathan left for camp today, and the house is pretty quiet.
should be more time for me to write.
I've been feeling better lately, but...
I still think about my mom a lot.
I still feel her sometimes, hear her voice...
and see her smile.
the truth is, I miss her.
I miss you. I miss Peyton...
and Keith... And Karen...
and Nathan while he's gone.
but it helps to have Quinny closer.
Hey, this is Quinn, and this is the beep.
Hi, Quinny. It's me again.
Nathan said he stopped by and you guys didn't answer, So...
just call me back when you get this.
you're starting to freak me out a little.
and I have something I want to tell you,
so... call me.
nerd.
the truth is, when it gets really quiet,
when the silence gets too loud
and I really start to miss everyone,
I tell myself the same thing
I can't see you, but I know you're there.
Wow.
I guess I picked the wrong day to ask for a job.
what exactly are we being charged with?
one count conspiracy to commit securities fraud,
one count conspiracy to commit wire fraud,
and three additional counts of wire fraud.
okay.
could you explain this to me as if I'm, say... 12?
the security-fraud charges allege a knowing misrepresentation of earnings
filed in quarterly and annual reports to the securities and exchange commission
on behalf of Clothes over Bros.
right.
how about like I'm 8?
we're being charged with lying to potential investors about the value of our company
to get them to invest in the men's line.
we're not proud of that.
does it matter if I was completely unaware of all of this?
well, unfortunately, they have signed documents that prove otherwise.
documents signed by who?
well, signed by you, Ms. Davis.
long Island Iced Tea, Freddie Fuddpucker,
salty Dog, Moscow Mule, and a Brain Blaster.
whoa.
are you trying to get me drunk?
Yes, and I'm also proving my bartender skills to my not-so-bossy boss.
hm. Brain blaster.
come on. How come yours is good?
cause I'm kind of awesome like that.
Plus, I changed the ingredients.
Oh, and check it out.
we're not open yet!
Hey, is this the bar where Alex Dupr? Is bartending?
Yeah. But we're not open yet.
that's fine. We'll wait.
I might have tweeted a few things.
it wasn't a dream. You went to bed.
do you remember? You went to the bedroom
Yeah, but then I came back.
no, you didn't come back.
just try and remember.
you went to the bedroom.
I went to the bedroom, and I turned the light on, and...
...Katie was there.
did you see the same thing I saw?
she had a gun.
clay, I didn't come back.
Oh, my god.
clay, what's happening?
it's my fault.
two victims coming in, both critical.
victim one -- male. Estimated mid-20s.
single gunshot wound to the chest.
victim two -- female. Estimated early 20s.
single gunshot to the abdomen.
both unresponsive, time unknown, with massive blood loss.
what do we got? - Two gunshot victims.
unknown down time. At least 12 hours.
how the hell's he still alive? Okay, O. R. Let's go.
Hey. Help her.
hey -- please help her!
it's my fault.
it's all my fault.
why is my signature on these documents?
because you live in Tree Hill with your friends, wandering about, going to film festivals and the like.
be careful, mother.
Brooke, we sign all kinds of things for you.
but you knew this was illegal.
and now my supposed signature is on everything.
honey, you empowered us to do this.
no, I empowered you to pick a cover model for the magazine, not to send me to prison. This is not my fault!
nobody's going to prison.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
but let me tell you something
if somebody is, it is not gonna be me.
you did this, and you helped her, and I will not take the blame for this!
Hi, Hales.
Hi. Um, I hate to ask, but I was just wondering
if you could pick Jamie up for me.
uh, I tried Brooke, and I couldn't get her.
sure. Is everything okay?
well, I can't really talk right now, but if you could just, um, get Jamie and keep him busy until you hear from me, that would be great.
he's at, um, Kennedy Park, okay?
no problem. I'll get him.
just call me when you can, okay?
okay. Thanks.
Bye.
Hey. This -- this isn't
okay, it is, but
can I borrow your car?
sure. Is everything okay?
everything is so not okay.
on second thought...
you better drive. I've been drinking.
Hey, Jamie. How you doing, buddy?
do I know you?
dude...
who are you -- Victoria Davis?
it's me -- Chase.
bartender from Tric. Well, Bar Manager.
I built you that snow fort in Utah.
Oh, right. Hey.
so, listen, um, your mom had something come up, so I'm supposed to pick you up today.
you ready?
Yeah, I don't think so.
no, seriously.
your mom called Mia, and we're supposed to get you.
well, I'm kind of hungry. Do you have any snacks?
I got some gum in the car.
okay, so, you expect me to get in your car and take candy from a stranger?
Yeah, I'm gonna have to pass.
what's up?
he doesn't want to go.
Hey, Jamie. Remember me?
I'm Mia. I work at Red Bedroom Records.
Oh, yeah. Hey.
you're really good friends with my mom, huh?
Yeah, that's right.
I am really good friends with your mom.
so, if you're really good friends with my mom, how come you weren't in Utah?
you make a good point.
no offense, but considering my history,
I'm gonna have to pass up on you, too.
dude, your mom left me a message to pick you up. You ready?
Yeah, sure. Let's go.
Hey.
man, that kid hates me.
I didn't even get invited to Utah.
I don't understand what's happening.
I mean, this has to be a dream.
I don't think so.
will you just stop and talk to me?
what are you looking for?
us.
Oh, thank God you're here.
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.
I came as soon as I got your message.
Julian's picking up Jamie. How are they?
Haley, I'm right here.
um, Quinn got out of surgery... - Hales.
and Clay didn't. -Haley!
it was horrible, Brooke.
and you found them?
she can't see me.
I can.
Thanks, man.
so, what are Mia and Chase doing here?
trying to kidnap me.
nice. Good thing we foiled them.
so, what went wrong?
nothing. Why?
well, it's just weird that you're picking me up.
no, it's not. We hung out together in Utah, bro.
we -- we had drinks at the bar, el borracho.
you gave me the good-luck gold star.
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna need that back.
okay.
I'm gonna have to use it for whatever you're not telling me about.
stop it.
so, baseball, huh?
Yep.
dude, I totally sucked at baseball.
I always used to strike out, and then they'd yell stuff like "Julian's screwed again.
stupid Brian Fernandez.
I could probably help you with that.
yeah?
well, not the bitter part about Brian Fernandez, but the hitting part.
okay, let's do it.
besides, we're probably gonna have to kill some time, huh?
until what?
until you tell me what went wrong.
bro, nothing went wrong.
come on, kid. Hung in there this long.
don't give up now.
you ever heard of anyone surviving something like this?
no.
blood pressure dropping.
we're losing him.
can I ask you something?
sure.
have you had your eyes checked lately?
thanks a lot.
you know what -- if you're so good at it, why don't you come out and show me what you got, hot shot?
all right.
beginner's luck.
okay, I think the machine's broken.
it's totally pitching slower now.
show-off.
it's not that hard.
you just have to swing level. Don't try to kill it.
okay.
lower your back shoulder a little bit.
okay.
a little more. - Yeah?
perfect. Now swing level.
Yeah! Nice! - Yeah!
that's the first hit I've ever gotten in my life.
hit another one.
Aah! Take that, Brian Fernandez!
you got to let it go, dude.
Yeah, I know.
Hey.
Thanks.
I thought they were dead.
I got worried when I didn't hear from them since Utah,
and... I just had this feeling, and I should have gone out there sooner.
Haley. - I should have.
and when Quinn didn't call me back,
I should have gotten in the car, instead of being lazy, and just gone
Haley, stop.
you just got home from Utah, and you found out that you're pregnant.
it's amazing that you went out there when you did.
it's more than I would have done.
do not beat yourself up over this.
you hear me?
after everything you've been through,
it's not good for you.
and it can't be good for the baby.
you did everything you could, Hales.
now, what can I do for you?
nothing.
it's just really nice to have you here.
I love you, Brooke Davis.
I know.
I love you, too.
I just don't think we say it enough, and I'm really sorry for that.
listen to me.
Quinn made it through surgery, and she can make it all the way back.
all right?
she's a James girl.
I just wish... The doctors would tell me something.
they're not telling me anything.
and now I have to talk to the police.
Oh, don't get me started on the police.
long story.
it's a long story
the reasons I thought we should break up.
you don't have to explain it.
no, I think I do.
I just hadn't been back in a long time, and every night, I'd sit on the tour bus and have conversations with the road.
and what did the road have to say?
the road said that a long-distance girlfriend who sleeps better on a bus than she ever has in her own bed
is a gypsy and a nomad and...
no girlfriend at all.
and then the night agreed with the road, and...
we all decided that you deserve better.
I guess I appreciate that, but...
the truth is, your texts made it sound like
you decided that you deserved better.
at least, whenever you actually responded at all.
I'm terrible with that. I know I am.
and I'm sorry.
Yeah.
so am I.
so, how'd you get this job, anyway?
it's kind of a long story.
you know, I asked Chase if he was hiring when we were in Utah.
I tied a cherry stem with my tongue.
damn it.
anyways, I thought you used to be on tv or something.
I thought you used to be in movies or something.
I'm taking a break.
Yeah. Me too.
only, uh, mine's kind of not on purpose.
that's like saying you're celibate when you can't get laid.
then I guess I'm celibate, too.
dude, really?
what?
I asked you for a job in Utah.
Yeah, but she kisses better.
man, you gave away my job and you lied to me about my kissing?
I wish I never made out with you in Utah.
he's joking.
Hey, if that's your story.
so, how'd it go with your ex, who's not as near as good as the current?
it went fine.
how'd it go here?
it went fine.
listen...
I'm sorry, but she tied a cherry stem with her tongue.
just sayin'.
Yes!
sorry.
Jamie, you don't have to say you're sorry every time you beat me at something.
okay, I told you that after pac-man, donkey kong, the rock-climbing wall, and skee ball.
well, sorry.
didn't you play anything when you grew up?
no sports, no video games?
I watched a lot of movies.
and I watched a lot of people.
I used to watch people and make up stories about them.
you didn't have any friends, huh?
okay, well, what kind of stories?
all right, take that guy.
that guy works here for now,
but he used to run the sideshow in a traveling carnival
until the bearded lady broke his heart and he had to get away.
my dad says I won't be able to grow a beard till I'm at least 30.
be happy about that.
okay, well, what about that guy?
that guy... Hates tattoo guy because tattoo guy called his graphic novels "Comic books.
he also borrowed his first-edition copy of "The Alcoholic" and never gave it back.
Chuck's mom is an alcoholic.
he totally spit in that drink, too.
all right, you try it.
okay. That lady... Isn't really that boy's mom.
she just had to pick him up
and do a bunch of fun stuff with him because something went wrong and she's too chicken to tell him.
Oh, and she's also about to bribe him with a nice cold root beer.
Really?
Hey.
Hey.
how are you doing?
I feel weak.
how's the other you doing?
I don't know.
I was checking on the other you.
we're still alive, aren't we, Clay?
I mean, we'll go back, right?
we'll be us again?
Yeah. Of course.
I just don't want it to be over.
I know.
if I have to be stuck here, even if it is forever...
at least I'm with you.
Hey, buddy.
it's me.
doctor says you can maybe hear me, so, uh...
if you can, why don't you -- I don't know
book me a rainstorm body spray commercial or something, and then we can get the hell out of here.
listen...
you know how you're always telling me what a warrior I am?
the truth is, you're the warrior.
my life is so much better because of you.
and I'm not sure I ever said "Thank you" for that.
the, um...
the doctors say it's a miracle that you're even breathing.
but I know that it's not.
all this is nothing.
cause I know your spirit.
and I've seen your strength.
okay, so...
just...
just come back to us when you can.
because I never said "Thank you.
and I never said "I love you.
I love you, too, Nate.
I'm gonna miss you, buddy.
you know, I was thinking the other day about those little plays we used to put on when we were little for the whole family.
you know, we would color invitations, and everybody got all dressed up.
we made snacks and lemonade.
and you always insisted on singing and dancing.
and you were... really terrible at both.
and you turned into this... beautiful swan.
I was so proud of you.
I went to the beach house to tell you that...
I'm pregnant.
and I want you to be the godmother, because it's been everything having you near me this past year.
they say you don't know what you've got till it's gone.
and I guess I didn't know how much I missed you till you were in my life every day.
how much I needed you.
come home soon, Quinny.
and if you see mom, you tell her to send you right back here to me...
because we have invitations to make and stories to write.
just me and my beautiful swan of a sister.
she's pregnant.
and I'm supposed to be the godmother.
you will be.
come on.
it's beautiful.
I was gonna take you here before we went to Utah.
well, why didn't you?
I just got busy, you know?
I thought that we had more time.
Hey, but promise me that you'll go back here someday.
we'll go. Together.
and promise me that you'll take the time
to feel... lucky and happy and fortunate.
don't waste days with "What could have beens" and "What should have beens.
clay, why are you telling me these things?
because those things don't matter.
why are you talking like this?
because you have to leave me now.
paging Dr. Stateman. Dr. Stateman, please.
so...
I got arrested today.
what? - Why? What happened?
apparently, my lovely mother and Millicent lied about the company's earnings and falsified a whole bunch of documents with my signature on them.
lied to who?
investors.
Brooke, how bad can this get?
I don't know.
I met with our attorney this morning.
they're saying some things, but...
how bad can it get?
I could lose the company.
Oh, my god.
why didn't you say anything?
because it's not life and death.
because I haven't even really congratulated you on your pregnancy.
I am so happy for you guys.
but I had a thought.
if you really like the new baby, can I have Jamie?
Yeah, you can have him.
but you have to have the sex talk with him first.
already?
it's like yesterday he was going on treasure hunts with Quinn.
it's my aunt Quinn, isn't it?
something happened to my aunt Quinn.
why would you say that?
well, because she was supposed to pick me up today.
and she never misses her day with me.
Yeah, buddy. Your aunt Quinn's in the hospital.
well, I'm glad they sent you to pick me up.
you don't just treat me like a kid.
so, can we go to the hospital now?
let me call your mom and check.
I'm really sorry about Clothes over Bros, Millie.
I'm just sorry for Brooke.
she trusted me, and I let her down -- again.
there's got to be some leniency, though, right?
I mean, you make restitution to the investors and you pay a fine or something.
I don't think it's that simple.
it's a federal offense.
Hey, bitch! What's the haps?
are you guys totally re-hooking it up?
okay. Sorry. I'm gonna walk away.
so, how's Brooke doing with her mom?
you were never proud of me, were you?
why would you say that?
because if you were proud of me, if you believed in me and in the men's line, you wouldn't have lied.
you wouldn't have felt the need to make Clothes over Bros seem better than it is.
is that what you think?
Yeah, it is.
well, you're wrong.
it's because I did believe.
I thought I could lie to them because I did believe in you, because I've seen you do amazing things.
and in the face of a poor economy,
I refused to believe that you wouldn't do it again.
I gamble on your talent, Brooke.
I gamble on your instinct and your ability to make miracles happen.
and I'm usually right.
gambling is what you pay me to do.
that other stuff -- that "I'm proud of you" part
I always did that for free.
it's always been the easy part.
what do you mean I have to leave you now?
I mean you have to go back.
with you.
Quinn, you've been saying it yourself.
you're feeling weak. You know why that is?
because your body's healing, so it's getting ready to leave this place.
so what?
so I've been feeling stronger.
my body's getting stronger.
it doesn't matter, okay? I'm staying with you.
you can't.
would you just stop saying things like that, okay?
we're together for a reason, okay,
and I'm not gonna leave you.
you don't have a choice.
Quinn, you can't choose not to live.
and even if you could, I wouldn't let you.
none of this is real, anyways.
listen to me.
Haley's pregnant.
she can't lose you right now.
I mean, what would that do to her?
and think what that would do to the baby.
think what that would do to Jamie.
now, remember what the doctor said.
got to be positive, upbeat, okay?
is it okay if I talk to her alone?
Yeah, of course.
I'll just be right outside if you need me, okay?
Hi, aunt Quinn.
I wanted to come see you because I knew something was wrong, and I know you'd never miss one of our days together unless you really had to.
I'm sorry that people do bad things like this, especially to good people, like you.
well, I'm just sorry, that's all.
anyway, I know you're gonna be okay, but just in case, I brought you something.
I love you, aunt Quinn.
and don't worry, 'cause you look really pretty.
not long ago, I was here praying for my mom.
I know.
I'm trying hard not to be angry.
I'm trying to be sympathetic to whatever sickness or disease would allow someone to do something like this.
but I think I'm losing that battle.
I'm way ahead of you.
you should be at camp.
it'll be fine.
it's fine.
good.
cause I need you.
I'm right here.
I want to stay with you.
I know.
and I want that, but you can't.
I can. Okay? I'm just fine, Clay.
I'm right here.
it doesn't matter.
I can't have you here with me.
wherever this is, I need you to go back.
Why?!
because it was my fault.
it was my fault.
I knew Victoria was doing the wrong thing, and I let her do it anyway.
what happened to me, Marvin? How did I get here?
are you asking the guy who used to be on buses and billboards in Omaha or the guy who needs you to pay for his drinks tonight?
I'm really sorry about what happened to you.
don't be.
but you came back from Omaha for me.
and I came back to a good job.
the rest of it was my doing, Millie,
so you're not to blame for this -- I am.
it was my fault, too.
it was my fault.
you were right.
I screwed up my relationship with Chase all on my own.
that doesn't mean you're not a bitch, because you are one.
it just means it was my fault.
it was my fault.
I blamed my mom and I blamed Millicent, but it's my company, and it was my fault.
but you didn't make them lie, Brooke.
no, I forced them to.
not directly, but I did with the choices I made.
Hey, you're not gonna lose the company.
okay?
but even if you did...
so what, you know?
you're here. We're here.
and after a day like today, it all gets pretty simple, doesn't it?
they can't take away your talent.
you built this company with your talent and your instincts.
and no one can take those away from you.
but everything is better with you.
everything is better and everything is safe,
and I can't live without you.
I don't want to, Clay.
you won't have to.
you won't.
then come with me.
please.
why can't you just come back with me?
Hey, listen to me.
I can't explain it, but this is what we have to do.
you just got to trust me.
then promise me.
I'll do whatever you say, okay?
okay.
just promise me you'll come back to me.
promise me you'll open your eyes and you'll live a long, healthy, amazing life.
promise it. Promise me.
I'm going to live a long, healthy, amazing life with you.
I promise.
till kingdom come.
now open your eyes.
I don't want to -- not if it means losing you, Clay.
I can't.
it won't.
I promise you.
till kingdom come.
I love you.
now open your eyes.
till kingdom come.
sleep well?
Yep.
so, I guess last night we must have...
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
when's the movie start?
you weren't supposed to read that.
you weren't supposed to lie about it, either, were you?
I have to leave next week.
closed over bros"!
what the hell is wrong with you?
I leave you alone and you go back to being that stupid girl who follows her heart.
what's wrong? I'm gonna lose my company.
for now, I say goodbye to this chapter of my life.
and I look forward to what comes next.
Oh, my God. Hi, Quinn.
W-what is she doing here? Clay, s-she tried to kill us!
I've got an idea, babe.
why don't we eat her brains?
on the count of two?
on the count of two.
Nathan, you have to help me. Clay is dead, and he's trying to kill me.
Clay's not dead. Not yet.
I'll just give him one of my kidneys, and he'll be fine.
it's not a match, but he can have it if he wants.
Oh, my God. Haley! Haley!
Haley! We have to go now!
it's too late.
Nathan already bit me.
Oh, my God.
I think it's only a matter of time before I become a vampire, too.
you mean zombie?
I'm pretty sure he's a vampire.
okay, look, it's kind of weird to be fighting about this, but he's definitely a zombie. We'll just agree listen to me! You have to take Jamie.
mom?
you're the only one that can protect him now from the vampires.
damn it, Haley
No! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, no!
you guys okay?
we're fine.
Quinn, toss me that bat.
OK catch
I will not let these vampire bridesmaids ruin our wedding. They're zombies!
are you kidding me?! Do you not see how slow they're moving?!
nice shot.
don't look at the dress!
I'm sorry! I didn't see it!
Quinn! Take Jamie and get out of here!
okay! Good luck!
hey Betty. Happy Halloween.
well, you'll be happy to know I decided to pass out actual candy this year instead of apples.
I know how much that embarrassed you last year.
excuse me.
why -- why -- why would you put that on when you know how I feel about clowns?
okay, I need you to stop staring at me.
Hi, mom. If you're there, who's the creepy serial killer on the couch?
that's Chuck.
she hates clowns.
so does my mom.
so, uh, where'd you get that awful mask there?
it's my dad's. He mostly wears it at night.
mostly.
okay.
Hey, mom, is dad still taking us trick-or-treating tonight?
Yeah, he, um... Can't stop talking about it.
trust me, there's nothing else he'd rather be doing tonight.
cool.
Bobcats' season opener is tonight.
I'm sorry you're not there, Nate.
Thanks, man.
hasn't really sunk in yet.
Hey, listen to this.
agents for Troy Jameson went on record today "stating that if a more realistic offer "doesn't come in from Atlanta this week, "they will immediately halt all negotiations "and instruct the star quarterback to re-enter the nfl draft next year.
they're bluffing, right?
no. Lesson one -- these guys don't bluff.
if they did, they'd lose leverage on all future negotiations.
leverage for other clients.
other prospective clients. Yeah, you're catching on.
so you're telling me Troy Jameson could miss out on his entire rookie season because his agents want to use him as an example for future clients?
well, yes an -- I mean, I'm sure that they're really trying to get him the best deal possible.
but to do that, they have to take risks.
Yeah, but the guys in the locker room are gonna hold that against him.
and if there's one thing I know, it's the second you lose the respect of your teammates, you're done.
you might as well pack up and go home.
happy Halloween, Marvin.
I got you a little something. Isn't it cute?
I've always thought abnormally small pumpkins were kind of cute. Thanks.
I listened to your podcast last night.
I never thought I'd learn so much about the rules of cricket.
well, never hurts to know the rules, Millie.
I'll keep that in mind.
um, so, do you want to hang out later, after the party?
sure. That sounds cool. I'll see you then.
okay.
so, you guys are finally back together?
it's not like that. We're just hanging out.
okay. This is just an observation, but, uh, I think she thinks you guys are getting back together.
see, girls just don't give their pumpkins to anyone.
dude, handle your own girl drama.
Hey.
where did Mouth get that tiny pumpkin?
Millie gave it to him.
I didn't know they were back together.
did you, uh, need a drink or something?
no, I'm good.
I just wanted to say that I'm really sorry Alex left town.
I never wanted .
look, we both know you wanted her gone.
and now she's gone.
you were right. I was wrong.
just do me a favor -- don't pretend you care, okay?
crisis intervention.
Hi. Haley?
Hi. You haven't called in a while.
I wanted to call, but...
I figured I shouldn't be wasting all your time.
I'm not the only person with problems.
trust me. You're not wasting a second of my time.
I look forward to your calls. So as long as you need someone to talk to, slainte, Haley.
sorry?
it means "cheers.
Oh. Hmm, I like that.
so I was thinking...
you don't even know my name.
it's Erin.
slainte, Erin.
how you feeling today?
how you feeling today, beautiful?
not very beautiful.
Oh. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go grab a mirror.
your reflection should take care of that.
stop.
I'm not feeling very good about myself right now.
you want to talk about it?
what's there to talk about? It's gone.
clothes over bros, everything I worked so hard to build
it's all gone.
not all of it.
Julian, I signed everything away.
Hey, come here.
tell me something.
why was clothes over bros so successful?
actually, I'll answer that.
it's because of you.
every design, every detail, every idea came from somewhere inside of you.
and that's still there. You can't sign that away.
but clothes over bros was me.
without it, I don't really know who I am anymore.
well, good news. Today's Halloween.
and even though it's a highly overrated creepy witch holiday, the one perk of it is you don't have to know who you are.
you can be anyone you want today.
I'll get it.
trick or treat!
aren't you a little old to be trick-or-treating?
but I guess you're right.
so no candy for me.
can I help you?
is my son here?
Oh, please, God, no.
mom? I didn't think you were coming for another couple weeks.
Oh! Well, apparently, I'm getting old, so I figured, why wait? Why waste any more time?
who knows how much time I've got left, right, Brooke?
Hi.
come on. Is that all you got?
Yeah. I think I need a break.
question
did you ever let me take a break when I asked you for one?
question -- have you ever been shot?
please tell me you're not gonna roll that out for the rest of our lives.
get used to it, all right? Surviving a gunshot is the ultimate trump card.
okay.
I was thinking about what you said
Yeah, right. I'm serious, Nate.
I can't do that. I'm not an Agent. Yeah, which is a good thing, because if you were, it'd be tampering.
I wouldn't even know what to say.
I don't need you to prepare a speech or anything, all right?
just talk to him. He's a good kid.
and you have a point of view ...ever get a chance to experience.
you've been inside the locker room.
you know how these guys think. He'll listen to you.
look, if you want to help me out with the agency, this is where you can start.
come on, Harry Potter! Quit stalling.
I totally would've made a better Harry Potter.
don't you think, Madison?
no. I think Jamie looks really cute.
hermione has a crush on Ron.
what are you talking about?
in the books.
you didn't read the books.
in the movies.
hermione has a crush on Ron. That's who she likes.
not Harry Potter. Just so we're all clear.
did I tell you I was gonna dress up as drag leg Laura tonight, but I didn't want Chuck to pee his pants again?
I didn't pee my pants. Yes, you did.
it was so bad, we had to wash your clothes in the stream.
but don't worry, Chuck.
tonight, my dad will be there to protect you.
Oh, and if you have another accident again, we have a washer and dryer here t the house.
Hey.
Hey, you just missed Nate.
what's that?
this is a giant bowl of candy.
I can see that. What's it for? Convenience.
you see, this way, te trick-or-treaters can browse through a selection of candies and pick whichever kind they want.
see, when I was a kid, I hated that the owner of each house would choose the treat for me.
it's Halloween, Quinn.
I know.
but you're looking at me like I'm kind of the crazy candy guy.
and you're still kind of looking at me like I'm crazy.
no. I just don't want random strangers on our front porch.
Well...Random little-kid strangers...
parents...
angsty teenagers who might decide to egg our house later.
Hey.
you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
I just haven't been sleeping much lately.
but you know what?
you're right. It's Halloween.
so let's get dressed up and put out your giant bowl of candy and try to enjoy it.
okay.
Nathan Scott. Thanks for coming.
you know, my dad took me to the final four when Maryland played Duke.
Oh, you were a beast in that game.
What'd you end up with, like 30 points?
honestly, I only remember the final score.
and I'm pretty sure Duke ended up with more points than us.
Yeah, but you sure did battle that night.
it was amazing to watch.
Thanks.
you know, I've never watched the tape of that game. It was too painful.
you ever need a reminder of how great you were, that's a good one to revisit.
so that sucks about your back.
I really liked what you said at your press conference --the part about when our hearts are willing but our bodies say no.
what about when your heart is willing but your agents say no?
you think I'm making a mistake?
I'm not here to judge you, Troy.
you already know the score. You've missed half the season.
there's nothing I can say that will bring those games back.
but there still is a lot of football left to be played.
and let's face it
you are a football player -- a good one.
so I think there's a point when you just got to ask yourself, whose holdout is this?
yours or your Agent's?
for about three months now.
and after all this time, you're the first person to ask it.
I need a drink.
what's wrong with the drink you're holding?
it's almost empty.
okay. I-I can't believe I actually have to ask you this, but do you like her? Brooke?
no, the waitress.
Yes, Brooke.
she is very nice.
and...
well, she strikes me as a little high-maintenance, which wouldn't be a problem if she hadn't just lost all of her money.
look, just get to know her. Okay?
because when you do, I promise you'll fall in love with her just like I did.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
I just wanted to stop and pick this up on the way.
it's, um, sort of a collection of ideas that I had for the wedding... What's left of them.
I-I know we can't afford most of them now, but I thought you might like to take a look anyway.
might be a nice way for us to get to know each other.
I like that idea. Thank you, Brooke.
Hey. Where's the pumpkin?
which pumpkin are you referring to?
the mni-pumpkin I gave you just a few hours ago.
Oh, that one. Where did I put that?
you tried to carve it, didn't you?
Yes.
and it caved in? It was a disaster.
they should put a warning sticker on those things.
yeah you know mini-pumpkins are just for decoration.
so, what's up? Nothing much. I just wanted to stop by and say hi.
look, Millie,
I-I just want to make sure we're both on the same page.
okay. What page are you on
I love hanging out with you.
I-I just want to make sure you know it's not serious.
we can't jump back into a relationship right now.
I'm not ready.
of course. I understand.
you sure you're okay with it?
Yeah. It's no big deal.
to be honest, I had been wondering what this was or wasn't.
and, um...Like you said, it never hurts to know the rules.
and now I know them.
thanks for telling me.
um, shoot. I got to go. I'll see you later.
these are, uh, interesting color choices.
thank you. I thought so, too.
I prefer more traditional tones, but...
well, this could work, in the right setting.
uh, I picked out the flowers.
what? I did.
the flowers here -- they are beautiful, Julian.
Oh. Is this the dress?
Yes. Don't show that to Julian. Oh. Sorry.
so the reason that I came a few weeks early is that I want to help with the wedding.
financially.
mom, what are you talking about?
I'm gonna pay for everything.
whatever you need...
mom, that is -- ...I'm gonna make this the wedding that you both always dreamed of.
I don't know what to say.
well, you can start by calling me "mom.
okay...
mom.
no. After the wedding.
I'm kidding.
okay.
welcome to the family, Brooke.
Cheers.
clay! Looks like we got our first trick-or-treaters.
time to bust out that giant bowl of candy.
here we go!
so, what do you think?
great. You're a zombie.
hmm? I got fangs. Well --and who are you supposed to be?
the weird girl from my 7th grade p. E. Class?
no. I have a cape, see? I'm super-Quinn.
trick or treat!
you look great. And look what I've got.
nice, huh? And convenient.
notice how you get to choose whatever type of candy you want.
I'm not randomly picking and tossing into your bag for you.
so go ahead. Dig in.
that one's good. Move.
what are you doing?
it's Katie she's outside. I saw her on the monitor. Clay, she came back.
baby...
no, please. Don't.
I'm really sorry.
where the heck is your dad?
all the good candy's probably gone by now.
shut up, Chuck. He'll be here.
Hey, guys. You ready to ?
Yeah. Yes.
look -- you guys look so great in your costumes!
especially you, Chuck. Tanks for not wearing the creepy clown mask.
I couldn't. My dad needed it tonight.
Oh. Well... I wish I hadn't brought it up.
Hey.
Where's your costume?
what is my costume? Um, I don't know yet.
I'm gonna go shopping with Brooke right now.
great. Do me a favor.
don't get us one of those embarrassing couples costumes. I really hate those thing
Oh. I love them.
Seriously?
no. Couple costumes suck.
so, Julian and I are gonna do a couples costume. Won't that be cute?
Oh, so cute. What you got in mind?
well, he really hates Halloween, so I'm gonna make it easy on him.
all he has to do is wear this clock, and I will go dressed as an orange.
a clockwork orange.
right. I don't get it.
it's one of Julian's favorite movies. Stanley kubrick.
Yeah. No, I've read te book I just don't know if the concept will read.
it'll read. Trust me. What are we getting you and Nate?
Hey.
I scared those little girls.
Yeah, well, they probably would've ended up in therapy, anyway.
I thought you were doing better.
so did I.
come here.
aren't you scared?
Yeah, sometimes.
but we have to live our lives.
we can't live in fear.
we've been home for almost two weeks.
and every night, I have nightmares.
and every night, I wake up, and I check the security alarm.
so I am living in fear.
why didn't you tell me?
cause I didn't want to burden you.
you're still healing.
baby, we're both still healing.
is it the beach house, or is it what happened to us?
because if it's the beach house, we can move.
I don't know.
look, I'm gonna suggest something, and I really want you to consider it.
I think you should take that photo assignment, the one in South Africa.
I think it would be good for you to get away from tree hill for a few weeks, clear your head.
clay, I don't want to leave you.
I'm gonna be okay.
I'm not going anywhere.
just promise me you'll think about.
I just
just think about it, okay?
I love you.
I love you, too.
Hey, Madison... Did you notice that I have twice as much candy as Jamie?
not really.
that's because you keep grabbing handfuls when they say take only one.
don't hate. That's how I roll.
how many more houses do we have, anyway?
my candy bag is getting way too heavy.
is anybody even home?
there's only one way to find out. Go for it.
you sure you want to ring that bell?
guess you haven't heard about the guy who lives here.
here we go.
what guy?
nobody's ever seen him.
but I heard he snatches up kids who step on his porch.
then he makes them eat a bunch of food to fatten them up.
then he cooks them.
that's "hansel and gretel.
or maybe he just chops them up.
I can't remember. Nobody knows for sure.
okay. Knock it off, Chuck.
there's nobody in that house chopping up kids.
Yeah. You're probably right. I'm sure it's just a story.
but you guys go ahead.
I'll wait here.
I'd like to live long enough to eat all this candy.
what do you think?
maybe. We should just go to the next house.
come see your costume! You're gonna love it!
What...The hell... Are you wearing?
this was supposed to be your costume.
you want me to go as Flavor Flav?
why are you dress like a dog Julian
you'll find out in about three seconds.
Oh, hi, Brooke.
well, what do you think, huh?
I thought you said you hated Halloween.
and now you know why.
all right, guys. This is it.
last House of the night. Finish strong.
good idea. I'm going for two handfuls.
that's not really what I meant.
Hey. Nathan Scott.
Yeah. Hi.
Wow. This is great. I'm a huge Bobcats fan -- huge.
I think they're gonna have a good year.
bet you'd give anything to be playing tonight.
actually, not really.
happy Halloween.
nice!
so I guess you'll be drinking Bourbon tonight?
sure. That's what ad men drink.
actually, on second thought, I'm just gonna get my drink from Mouth no offense.
dude, I'm just gonna pour it from a bottle.
what could go wrong?
that's like the fourth clown I've seen at this party.
five.
that's a really sad one, too.
Oh, I hate the sad ones.
Hey.
so, what do you think?
the little mermaid"?
no. Just a mermaid that happens to be somewhat little.
pregnant cheerleader?
Yep. I'm me in high school.
got it.
I thought you were gonna dress up tonight.
I did. Dressed up as a guy who keeps getting dumped.
well, I'm not sure that reads.
well, someone should probably go introduce open-mike night.
have fun no jokes.
you gonna take it easy on her? Come on. She's trying.
Hey, everybody. Thank you all so much for coming out tonight.
you all look great.
as a lot of you already know, red bedroom is always looking for new talent.
so take a number if you don't have one and show us what you've got.
and whoever's number one... You're up.
Wow. What are you?
I'm a free bitch, baby.
lady Gaga.
Oh. Right. Drink?
Yes. Please. I would like the strongest drink you have that wasn't invented by Chase.
listen, Brooke, I haven't had a chance to tell you how sorry I am you had to sell clothes over bros.
Thanks...yet
well, one of the things I've always admired about you is your ability to fight through every obstacle.
that's why I know you're gonna be okay
because you're you.
you're a good friend, Mouth.
so, what are you supposed to be tonight?
a pumpkin? An orange?
I'm actually half of "a clockwork orange.
I don't get it.
you know. The movie.
stanley kubrick.
Oh. Right.
I don't get it.
neither do I.
Hey, Chase. This is my mom, Sylvia.
Oh. It's nice to meet you.
Hi. I need a drink you got it.
just invented a special Halloween cocktail.
want to try it?
don't do it. Trust me.
that sounds great. Thank you.
you've been warned.
so... Have you talked to Alex?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. She's doing great.
uh, the director is a bit of a control freak, but she thinks the movie's gonna be good.
I know she misses you, though.
she say that?
right.
so, at have you been up to?
I'm, uh, working on a documentary.
Oh, yeah? What is it about?
it's about starting over -- you know, what comes next.
I'd love to talk to you about it.
maybe -- maybe you could be in it.
sure. Whenever you want. Let me know.
okay.
here you go.
and black olives to set the mood.
I call it the Chase-o-lantern. Enjoy the buzz.
Oh, God.
that's bad.
that is a bad drink. That is just terrible.
you like these, huh?
nice six-pack.
still douche-y even when the abs are plastic.
Yeah, that's what I'm going for.
did you ask him? Not yet. I'm getting there.
ask me what?
you ever high-five Julian?
what kind of question is that? A straightforward
you either have or you haven't.
no. No, I've never high-fived Julian.
Why? Have you guys high-fived him?
I was the first. It happened the other day.
and based on my experience, I told Chase he should instigate one, as well. And I did.
and am I missing something?
you got to do it,
he's standing right over there. Now's your chance.
are you guys being serious? Yeah.
if you don't, you'll always wonder.
okay.
Hey, Nathan. What's going on?
not much. Just, uh... Just hanging out.
dude, that is an awesome dog costume.
high five. Right on.
good night.
sometimes they travel in packs.
trick or treat!
uh, sorry for the technical difficulty.
I'm going to get a flashlight. You okay?
I got the giant bowl of candy.
okay. Here, let me give you some candy.
Hey, hey. Let them pick their own.
Oh. Sorry. Forgot the rules.
dig in. Get some candy.
okay, guys, come on. Come on. Dig in. Take as much as you want.
big surprise.
looks like I win.
unless there's a house that we skipped where you can get more candy.
Oh, wait. There is. But Jamie was too scared.
I wasn't scared.
then prov it. Let's go right now.
we don't have anyone to take us.
now you're too scared to walk down the street at night?
maybe Madison and I should find a new friend to hang with.
all right, fine. Let's go.
well, what are you waiting for?
he's probably asleep by now.
no way. He's too busy chopping up little kids.
I knew you weren't brave enough to ring the bell.
fine. If you're too scared, then I'll go do it.
Madison, protect Jamie while I'm gone.
see? It's not that scary.
Chuck! No, back, back!
Thanks, Uncle Joe. We hosed them.
it's over. You can look now.
a clown band? You kidding me?
actually, they weren't terrible.
last act of the night coming up. Number 23.
I never really thanked you take me to portland couple weeks ago and it was really good for me to get out of town and gain some perspective.
Yeah. We all need that sometimes.
I wanted to apologize for snapping at you earlier.
it wasn't fair.
I know you're just trying to be my friend.
Thanks.
but I have a confession to make. I'm glad Alex is gone.
I'm sorry.
and I'm not saying it's me. But you deserve somebody
and I know you're gonna find her, Chase.
Millie, you ready to go?
actually...I found a ride.
you're going home with Spartacus?
just playing by your rules.
ready?
damn it.
Hey. You were great -- I mean really great.
thanks very much.
Slainte.
Cheers.
I just wanted to make sure you knew how grateful I am that you're helping us with this wedding.
you're welcome, Brooke. I have a lot of ideas.
I think we should consider going with more traditional colors.
and I really would like you to take another look at the neckline on that dress.
after all, those pictures are gonna last a lifetime.
I want you to take that photo assignment.
gallery's gone.
then I think it's important that you go.
Why?
because this will save you.
this won't.
I was scared.
I know.
I'll go. Just promise me you'll be okay. I will be.
whoa. Is that what I think it is?
final four.
I thought this game was in the vault.
you know how there are a handful of moments in your life that you just know while it's happening you're gonna remember it for the rest of your life?
I had one of those moments tonight when I looked at Jamie
why are you watching this game, Nate?
I guess I just needed a reminder.
of?
my whole lie... I knew one thing
that I was great at basketball.
I always had that to fall back on.
now that basketball is over, I just...
just keep asking myself the same question over and over.
will I ever be great at anything again?
you'll find it.
if there's one thing that I am not worried about with you, it's that you'll find something to be great at again.
come on.
turn it up. Let's finish the game.
we already know how it ends.
the game...
but not the rest of it.
come on.
and Scott ties the game on a three-pointer with a minute left to play folks, Nathan Scott is having one of those nights he's going to remember for the rest of his life.

they don't pass you on breathing...
without taking the final.
Hey, quit with that radio.
I'm trying to study.
hope it's a long train.
I'm going to flunk.
[ lazenby ] We're going to be late.
does my hair look like shit?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, there's Pratt.
let me out.
[ lazenby ] No dirty stuff.
Pratt, you have nice knees!
Hey, interested in something, Jarrett?
Hey, Cleary!
Hey, Cleary!
[ woman ] Let's discuss theory.
Conrad, what's your theory on Jude Fawley?
what's your theory on Jude Fawley?
was he powerless in the grip of circumstances...
or could he have helped himself?
I don't-- Powerless?
he thought he was.
he was a jerk.
he was hung up on morals.
it was senseless.
that's too easy, Joel.
I found the book hard to follow.
come on!
hello.
hello.
Dr. Berger?
yes?
Hi. This is Conrad Jarrett.
who?
Dr. Crawford at Hillsboro Hospital gave me your number.
I'm with a patient now.
can you call back at 2: 1 5?
I don't think I'll be free.
give me your number.
I'll call you tonight.
Hello?
Hello?
I'll call you back. Thanks.
go!
come on. Move it, you guys!
keep it going!
keep plugging!
use those legs!
lazenby, get with it!
jarrett, head down!
work it!
come on, now! Push off!
get your head down, Jarrett!
come on! Keep it going!
dig in there! Come on!
push off, Jarrett!
push off!
is he actually inclined to lose?
well, regionally.
it's too bad.
I mean...
it's tragic, really.
look at him now.
he's lost everything.
fish too dry?
it's not too dry.
C&S has a new mechanic.
what happened to Harry?
I think he moved to Skokie.
this new mechanic is so awkward.
is that shirt ripped?
leave it on the table in the hallway.
wasn't that girl in the hospital from Skokie?
what was her name?
[ Beth ] Will you play round robin at the club?
I haven't played in a year.
well, isn't it time to start?
we're going to Clark Murray's birthday party Saturday.
I bought him that book on wine.
not the Murrays.
cut the rope, now, Bucky!
we're going in!
give me your hand!
Hi. How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
couldn't be better. Terrific. Yeah.
come in. They all do that.
come in.
sit down.
I just have to...
wire some...
volume.
sorry. Sit down.
you have trouble finding the place?
not yet.
how long since you've been out of the hospital?
a month and a half.
feeling depressed?
no.
on stage?
pardon me?
people nervous...
treating you like you're a dangerous character?
Yeah, I guess a little.
are you?
I don't know.
how long were you in the hospital?
four months.
what did you do?
I tried to off myself.
it doesn't say what your method was.
double-edged Super Blue.
Oh.
is everybody glad to see you home?
Yeah.
friends?
Yeah.
you're back in school.
everything okay there? Teachers?
Yeah.
no problems?
Uh-uh.
so why are you here?
uh...
I'd like to be more in control.
Why?
so people can quit worrying about me.
who's worried about you?
my father, mostly.
this is his idea.
and your mother?
isn't she worried, too?
I don't know.
look, I'll be straight with you.
I don't like this already.
as long as you're straight.
have you talked to Crawford?
Yes. He called me.
he told me to look for you.
he said you had a brother who died.
boating accident, wasn't it?
want to tell me about it?
you talked this over with Crawford, right?
right.
how did that go?
it didn't change anything.
what needed changing?
I'd like to be more in control.
Why?
so people can quit worrying about me.
well, I'll tell you something.
I'll be straight with you, okay?
I'm not big on control.
but it's your money.
so to speak.
so to speak.
okay.
how's Tuesdays...
and Fridays, same time?
twice a week?
well, control's a tough nut.
I've got swim practice every night.
well, that's a problem.
how do we solve that?
guess I'll skip practice twice a week.
well, it's up to you.
I don't like being here.
I don't like it at all.
Mm-hmm.
I saw Mort Swain. His sister died.
the one from Idaho?
the one with the restaurant.
she died in Idaho?
I guess so.
Why?
you said she was always traveling.
I don't know.
maybe in Idaho.
maybe Kansas City.
I went to see Dr. Berger.
Yeah.
you didn't say anything. Good!
I went today.
I didn't know you made an appointment.
how was it?
it's a lot of money.
it's okay.
it's $50 an hour, twice a week.
it's okay. It is necessary.
what did you talk about?
not much.
what about your schedule?
well, it'll cut into swim practice.
Where's his office?
head straight!
I don't want to tell you again.
this is what I see.
I see you yawning and you coming late.
I don't see you having fun.
are you getting enough sleep?
Yeah.
are you having fun?
fun?
there's no point if you're not having fun.
Yeah, I guess so.
you guess so.
are you on medication?
tranquilizers?
anything?
no. No, sir.
did I ask you if they gave you shock?
Yeah.
yeah what?
Yeah, you asked me.
Yeah, they did.
don't look at us, Lazenby.
get in the water!
I'm no doctor, Jarrett.
I wouldn't let them put electricity in my head.
he drives me nuts!
everybody drives you nuts.
don and Fenetch looked good.
they looked very good.
is he giving you a hard time?
want a clarinet?
van Buren wants a clarinet.
who's selling it?
my brother. He needs a motorcycle.
you stand behind me in the choir.
Oh, I do? Is that you?
you have a lot of energy.
I do?
I mean, that's good.
my name's Jeannine Pratt.
nice. Hi.
you're Conrad Jarrett.
right.
Yeah. Um, bye.
Bye-bye.
you've got a lot of energy. "
[ children ] Trick or treat!
you're the scariest ghost I've ever seen!
you look wonderful.
thank you.
there you go.
be careful.
thank you. Good-bye.
the Cabots. Julie's first time.
she's so cute!
ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
know what I've been thinking?
that Christmas in London...
would be like something out of Dickens.
we've never done that before.
maybe we shouldn't plan to go away right now.
we talked about it.
we decided on that.
Yeah, I know that.
but the timing doesn't seem right.
we've always gone away at Christmas.
it'd be good for him, too.
let's get back to normal.
he's just started with this doctor.
he'll miss three weeks.
why interrupt it?
because I want to get away.
I think we should. It's important.
not if he doesn't go through with this now.
he might change his mind.
if he changes his mind...
it wasn't right for him.
does he want to go?
he doesn't know what he wants.
Ahh!
don't do that!
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you were here.
I just got in.
no golf today. Too cold.
how was golf?
I didn't play.
it's colder today.
I mean, for the year, it's colder.
weren't you swimming?
Yeah. Sorry I scared you.
how'd it go?
good. I swam well.
good.
I could swim the 50 if my
my timing got better.
I'm a little off.
you must work at that.
Yeah.
I got 7 4 on a Trig quiz.
gee, I was awful at Trig.
Oh, yeah? Did you
you took Trig?
wait a minute.
did I take Trig?
I bought you two shirts. They're on your bed.
who'll be there?
well, the Murrays, the Gunthers, and the Caines.
let's go to the movies instead.
don't be negative.
that's not negative. That's unpredictable.
let's go to the movies.
okay.
Really?
okay, yeah. Come on. Let's go.
what's our excuse?
Beth wanted to go to the movies.
good.
very good.
all right now, smile.
remember, not too many martinis.
will you put that with the others?
look. We're in time.
look who's here!
three blocks away and the last to arrive.
come on in.
happy birthday! You look wonderful.
is that new?
Yes, it is. Do you like it?
you did the mousse?
it turned out well?
Hey, partner. How are you?
hi there.
Hi, Beth.
good to see you.
borrow the money.
I'll go public.
I wouldn't do it now because the market's low.
your hair looks wonderful.
it's shorter. You like it?
I said, ""Please put out your cigar. "
he says, ""Huh? I don't have another one. "
good to see you!
you look beautiful, as ever.
in school...
they think they've got to walk on the edge of danger.
what are these hushed tones?
he told the funniest joke!
I'm not talking to you.
Why?
I have my fingers crossed on this merger.
let's have lunch.
I don't know my schedule.
I'm free most days.
Bob McLean's leaving Coles and Johnson.
where is he going?
he doesn't know.
Jesus.
no, you didn't.
isn't he the meanest man you've met?
when a ball is in play, if a player or caddy accidentally move it...
Hi, Annie. What's your boy up to?
Oh, who knows?
how's Conrad doing?
he's great. Just great.
I asked Donald. He says they haven't talked much.
I said maybe he's self-conscious.
Oh!
no, no, no.
no, he's
there's a doctor in Highland Park...
that he sees twice a week.
he's great. Just great.
is he still having some problems?
no, nothing like that.
just somebody to talk to...
to polish off the rough edges.
how are you, darling?
is he falling asleep on you?
Nah. He's great.
Hey.
you drank too much.
I'm not drunk.
why did you tell Annie about Conrad's psychiatrist?
why not?
people don't hear that thing easily.
for most people, it's a status symbol.
well, your blurting it out...
was a violation of privacy.
whose privacy?
the family's privacy!
I think it is a very private matter.
I tell you my dreams?
I don't believe in dreams.
what kind of a psychiatrist are you?
what's happening?
what's going on?
I just feel
I feel so
what?
jumpy. I don't know.
look, kiddo...
I lied.
I believe in dreams.
sometimes I want to know what's happening when you're awake.
something's making you nervous.
maybe I need a tranquilizer.
tranquilizer?
what do you think?
you look like something out of The Body Snatchers.
it's not my impression that you need a tranquilizer.
what is this?
a clock.
you can tell the time, but I can't.
so you know when the hour's up?
right.
50, 55 minutes?
maybe I don't want to swim anymore.
my timing is for shit.
two guys better than me swim the 50.
they're a bunch of boring jocks.
and him-- I can't stand him.
thought about quitting?
you telling me to?
Nope.
it wouldn't look good.
how does it feel?
how does it feel?
Yes. How does it feel?
it's the same damn thing I did last year.
are you the same person now?
that's why you need a tranquilizer?
you're a doctor.
I'm supposed to feel better, right?
not necessarily.
is it getting any easier with your friends?
no. It's still hard.
is any place easy?
the hospital was.
it was? Why?
because nobody hid anything there.
was there anyone there you could talk to?
Uh-huh.
I mean, beside Dr. Crawford?
Uh-huh.
Whoa!
Hi.
how are you?
good.
sit down, please.
thank you.
Wow.
when did you get back?
the end of August.
good.
it's great to see you.
Oh, you, too.
listen, I've got a meeting over at the school.
drama Club meeting.
we're doing A Thousand Clowns.
you know it?
anyway, we're going crazy getting it together.
don't let me hang you up.
no. I wanted to see you.
I didn't know what to expect.
you sounded funny on the phone.
it was just a gray day.
everything's great. I'm on the swim team.
Oh, you're swimming?
terrific, Conrad.
that's really wonderful.
I could be benched all year.
you'll do great.
I'll bet your folks are real proud of you.
Yeah.
what can I get you?
are you hungry?
just a coke.
two cokes, please.
did we offend him?
something I said?
a low self-image day.
so, uh
are you-- - What did
I can't believe how beautiful you look.
you really look beautiful.
so do you.
do you miss it?
miss what?
the hospital.
no.
thank you.
you don't miss it?
no.
you don't miss Leo's corny jokes?
are you seeing a doctor?
Yeah, I'm seeing one. Are you?
uh, Dr. Crawford gave me a name.
I went for a while.
it didn't work.
he told me the things I already knew.
finally, I decided...
the only one who can help me is myself.
at least, that's what my dad says.
if it's something you want to do, that's what you should be doing.
I don't know how long I'll keep it up.
your hair grew in.
Oh. That was such a dumb thing to do.
I like it.
you do?
Yeah.
I don't know. I just
I miss it sometimes.
the hospital.
I really do.
things have to change, you know?
but that's where we laughed.
but that was a hospital.
this is the real world.
I guess you're right.
I really have to go.
I'm sorry.
I have a meeting at the school.
we're doing A Thousand Clowns.
you told me.
did I?
Yeah.
I better hurry.
don't want to be late.
thanks for seeing me.
let's have a great Christmas.
okay?
let's have...
a great year.
let's have the best year of our lives.
this could be the best year ever.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
will you call me?
Yeah.
you mean it?
Yep.
you, uh
you look good, Conrad.
Yeah.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Hey!
would you cheer up?
it's cold.
you should put that on.
do you want a sweater?
do I need one?
what are you doing?
nothing.
thinking.
about what?
not about anything.
your hair is starting to grow out.
it's looking-- looking better.
I was thinking about the pigeon...
that hung around the garage, how it used to get on top of your car.
Oh, yeah, I remember.
I remember how scared I got
that wsssshhhhh! Flap, flap, flap
every time I started the car.
that was the closest we came to having a pet.
buck tried to talk you into getting a dog.
he said, ""If it's the size of a football? "
you know, that animal next door...
that Pepper or Pippin
he's not friendly...
whatever Mr. McGreary says.
he wanted the retriever.
each time that dog comes here, I try to get him out.
Arf!
Arf! Arf!
put that on if you're staying out here.
can I help?
with this?
no.
I will.
you can go to your room...
and clean the closet.
mom.
okay?
because it's really a mess.
hello.
Oh, hi.
I didn't get there.
how did it go?
no, I'm not doing anything.
just getting dinner ready.
Uh-huh.
did she really?
Mary Ann Ramon started just to scream, right?
we got so drunk, we couldn't talk.
it was the last day of school.
we walked out of the building.
Oh, Bucky.
no, stop!
what do you expect from her?
we just don't connect.
why not?
we just don't.
what are you thinking?
that I jack off a lot.
so what else is new?
does it help?
for a minute.
what now?
John-Boy.
who?
John-Boy on The Waltons.
Yeah. What about him?
after Buck died, Dad came to my room.
he didn't know what to say.
he put his arm around me.
we just sat there.
I remember watching his shoe, and thinking
his shoe was turned over on its side.
I was thinking, he's so uptight! It's gonna crack off.
I knew I should've felt something.
I didn't know what to feel.
on TV, they say stuff like, ""Oh, no! "
but I didn't say that...
because I didn't feel sad...
so much as
so much as what?
I kept thinking John-Boy would've said something...
about how he felt.
what would he say?
I don't know.
come on.
come on.
come on what?
don't hold back.
well, at least she's an improvement.
that's what you get...
when your partner does the hiring.
that's my fault.
I can't tell anybody...
that they're not making it.
wait a minute.
that's not the problem.
where are you?
what?
I've been losing you these days.
Oh, I'm sorry.
that's okay. That's okay.
you off the track?
huh?
come on. I've known you for 20 years.
is something wrong?
how's Connie?
Connie's all right.
he is. He's okay.
it's none of my business...
but you worry too much.
you've been on the rack about him long enough.
I'm not on the rack about him.
in a year, he'll be gone.
off to Michigan or wherever he wants to go.
maybe he'll tour Europe.
who knows?
I can't argue with ""Who knows. "
I'm giving you the benefit of my experience.
Thanks.
Valerie isn't just living away from home...
she's gone.
got her own friends, her own life.
she breezes in a few days on vacations.
I don't know. Maybe girls are different.
or maybe she was too aware...
of what was happening between Nance and me.
but they leave, and that worrying's just wasted energy.
[ young Conrad ] Give me back my sweater!
hang on.
[ Bucky ] Dad, what's possession?
give it to me!
it's already on me.
whose sweater is it?
it's my sweater!
I'll give it back...
if you give me my skis.
all right.
what?
[ man ] Watch your back.
cuts are vertical.
he really meant business.
let's go.
[ conductor ] Lake Forest is next.
what do you want?
I don't know what else to do.
I'm not asking for anything.
you're kidding me.
I don't get it.
you're excused from practice...
to see some shrink;
I work with you at your convenience.
what more should I do?
nothing.
a bright kid like you.
I don't get it.
why keep messing up your life?
I don't think that quitting swimming...
will mess up my life.
okay.
okay. Now, this is it.
Yeah.
you're a big kid.
actions have consequences.
I'm not taking you back.
I won't ask you to.
what happened? You all right?
Yeah.
you quit the swim team.
Yeah.
Why?
it was a bore.
that's no reason!
what's going on?
nothing.
talk to me.
swimming's a bore, that's all.
I talked to
quit talking to people!
okay?
holy shit.
Yeah, sure.
fuck you, Jarrett.
Ooh! Ohh!
shut up.
leave it alone.
I told you, the guy's a flake.
what did your dad say? - I haven't told him.
how come?
the timing isn't right.
he sweats everything.
he'll just get worried.
can you tell your mother?
my mother?
I told you we don't connect.
what do people have in common with mothers anyway?
it's all surface junk.
you know?
clean your room, brush your teeth...
get good grades. "
I'm not feeling anything today.
I'm sorry.
no. Sorry's out.
something's on your mind.
what time is it?
never mind. There's time.
remember the contract? Control?
maybe there's some connection...
between control and lack of feeling.
I said I feel things.
when?
when?
sometimes. I don't know.
I thought you didn't like fooling around.
what do you want?
don't say, ""I don't know. "
should I make up answers?
make one up about there's no feelings there.
I have feelings.
get it together, Jarrett.
you're trying to make me mad.
are you mad?
No!
you don't like being pushed.
do something about it!
what?
no. I can't do this.
why not?
getting mad takes too much energy.
it takes more holding it back.
when I let myself feel, I feel lousy.
# I never promised you a rose garden
fuck you, Berger.
fuck you.
yeah?
that's it.
what do you feel? Do you jack off?
what do you think?
you married a fat lady...
and you fuck the daylights out of her!
sounds good to me.
little advice about feeling
don't expect it always to tickle.
do you know how to aim that?
be quiet, I have to concentrate.
be quiet.
is it in focus?
smile, smile. Okay. Good.
I want to take the three young ones.
dad, get out of there.
all right.
be quiet.
Conrad, where are you?
between your mother and father.
you're taller than your mother is!
will you be quiet?
this is beautiful.
shut up.
wonderful.
now Cal and Beth.
sure.
go on.
you can do better than that.
I want one of Connie and Beth.
let's get the three men in there.
move closer to your mother.
prize winner.
Yeah, that's great.
do it.
isn't it marvelous?
Yes, it is.
it isn't cocked.
hold it. Connie, smile.
smile.
give me the camera.
give me the camera.
I want a really good picture.
I want a shot of you three men.
not until I get you two.
give her the goddamn camera!
smile.
who's hungry? I'll make the sandwiches.
it can be saved.
that was so dumb.
I don't think he's happy in school.
have you talked to his teachers?
people don't want to be with him.
he provokes people.
well, it's an awkward age.
thank you.
maybe he needs a change.
is he eating enough?
Yes, Mother.
he'll be all right.
if you're firm with him.
I think he should go away to school.
I can't deal with him.
who'd make that decision?
I suppose this doctor he's seeing.
what sort of doctor...
would make that decision for you?
a psychiatrist.
I thought that was finished.
no.
what's his name?
jewish doctor?
I suppose he's Jewish.
maybe just German.
# Amen ##
okay.
that last ""E " natural could be higher.
officers, don't forget your meeting tonight.
Hi, Jeannine.
you're really a terrific tenor.
in fact, you should be doing the solo.
no, I
no, I'm serious.
you sing well.
I'm getting to know your voice.
how can you hear me if you're singing?
well...
I don't always sing.
sometimes I just listen.
for instance, Marcia Blair can't sing a note.
Janet Fox mouths the words and never sings.
a detective.
[ Jeannine ] Do you like Vivaldi?
[ Conrad ] Telemann? Um
what kind of music do you like?
Oh, uh
modern jazz, I like.
folk rock, spoon on a glass.
spoon on a glass?
Oh, you mean, like, table spoons?
Oh, dear.
why do I ask dumb questions?
I'm just showing off.
why is it so hard...
the first time you talk to somebody?
you make it look easy.
Really?
that's my bus. I got to go.
I'll see you later!
you're really a terrific tenor.

hello.
is Karen there?
who's calling?
a friend of hers from Hillsboro.
Oh.
she's not home from school yet.
Oh, um
hmm. Tell her I called.
this is Conrad.
tell her I'm feeling great...
and I wanted to talk to her.
Yes, I will.
thank you.
Hello, Jeannine. This is Conrad.
Hello, Jeannine. This is Conrad.
Hello, Jeannine. This is Conrad.
what a dumb name.
Hello, Jeannine. This is Bill.
hello.
hello. This is
hello. This is Conrad calling.
Oh.
Oh, hi!
listen, I was
I was wondering if maybe you'd like...
to go out sometime.
like on a date?
we wouldn't have to call it a date.
we could see how it goes.
that was dumb. Now start over.
this is Conrad Jarrett.
I'd love to. When?
I didn't see you.
what do you think?
fine.
Rawlins used to have great scotch pines.
they look like skeletons this year.
Hi. What do you think?
it's very nice.
what is wrong?
ask him what's wrong.
maybe you won't have to hear it from Carol Lazenby.
hear what?
I quit the swim team.
Carol thought I knew.
it happened over a month ago.
quit? When?
where have you been every night?
nowhere. The library mostly.
I didn't think it mattered.
that was meant for me.
it's important to hurt me, right?
you have that backwards.
do I embarrass you in front of friends?
poor Beth believes every lie her son tells. "
I didn't lie.
you did when you came home at 6: 30!
if the lying's starting again, I can't stand it!
then go to Europe!
she only gives a fuck because someone else knew about it first!
she never came to the hospital...
because she's busy going to goddamn Spain and Portugal!
she doesn't care if I'm hung up by the balls out there.
they may talk like this at the hospital...
but we're not at the hospital.
you never came to the hospital!
she had the flu and couldn't come inside.
she would've visited Buck in the hospital!
buck never would've been in the hospital!
that is enough!
I won't do it again.
what in hell has happened?
somebody better go up there.
he walks all over us...
then you apologize to him.
you've been apologizing to him...
since he returned from the hospital!
I'm trying to goddamn understand him!
don't talk to me...
the way he talks to you.
let's not fight, okay?
no fighting, okay?
please.
let's go upstairs.
I want to talk to you.
I didn't mean any of it.
please don't be mad.
I'm trying to understand what happened.
I don't know what happened.
I didn't mean it.
tell her I'm sorry, will you?
why don't you?
God, I can't!
I can't talk to her!
why not?
it doesn't change anything.
it doesn't change the way she looks at me.
she was hurt because you quit the team.
I don't mean just now.
I don't mean just today.
explain it to me.
I can't. You don't see things.
what things?
what things?
I want you to tell me.
can't you see she hates me?
she doesn't hate you.
you're right. She doesn't.
please leave me alone.
do you think Dr. Berger's helping you?
it's not his fault.
I'll be downstairs if you need me.
tuesday everything was hunky-dory.
you're the doctor.
don't take refuge in one-liners, okay?
because that pisses me off.
okay. Okay.
everything was fine...
till you had the fight with your mother?
I don't blame her.
she's got her reasons. It's impossible...
after all the shit I've pulled.
what shit have you pulled?
I'm talking about proportion.
now, what shit?
you can find one example.
don't say you tried suicide.
what have you done lately?
I'll never be forgiven for that.
never.
you can't get out the blood in her towels...
and in her rug.
everything had to be pitched.
the bathroom tile had to be regrouted.
she fired the maid...
because she couldn't dust right.
if you think I'll forgive
she's gonna forgive me
what?
I think I just figured something out.
what?
who it is who can't forgive who.
[ berger ] A real problem has a real solution.
[ Conrad ] I've heard this before.
doesn't make it any less true.
I'm so tired.
that's some secret you've been keeping.
so what do I do now?
recognize her limitations.
like she can't love me.
no. Like she can't love you enough.
don't blame her for not loving you...
more than she's able.
she loves my father.
she loved my brother.
it's me.
we're back to the rotten kid routine.
she can't love you because you're unlovable.
how come your Dad loves you?
he feels responsible.
besides, he loves everybody.
the guy's got no taste.
he loves you, but he's wrong.
look...
maybe she can't express it...
the way you'd like.
maybe she's afraid to show her feelings.
what do you mean?
there's someone besides your mother...
you've got to forgive.
you mean me?
for trying to off myself?
don't stare. What for?
why don't you let yourself off the hook?
what did I do?
what did I do?
we'll talk Thursday.
come on!
time's up.
what did I do?
you know the rules.
what rules?
think about it.
just think about it.
Jesus!
say, after going to a new high...
it falls to 1 1 2 1 / 4...
and then rallies on good volume.
I order to buy 4, 000.
if I get the 4, 000 at 1 1 3 3/ 4, I know something's wrong.
but suppose I order to buy the 4, 000 shares...
and I plug in at 1 1 3 3/ 4...
I get 2, 000 at 1 1 4, 500 at 1 1 4 1 / 4...
and the rest on the way up.
then I know I'm right.
I'm going to peel off here.
see you later.
[ voice Echoing ] Suppose the order to buy
[ Beth's Voice ] You let him walk all over us...
and you apologize.
[ man's Voice ] 500 at 1 1 4
[ Conrad's Voice ] Dad, you don't see things.
[ Beth ] You've been apologizing...
since he returned from the hospital.
tell her to stop it!
buck never would've been in the hospital!
she hates me!
I want to be clear.
that's good.
in the car, I was thinking, "be clear. "
I suppose that's what psychiatry's about.
being precise and clear.
and honest, of course.
I'm not a great believer in psychiatry.
okay.
what happens here is between you and him...
and I respect that.
he's better. I can see that.
I just don't believe in psychiatry...
as a panacea for everybody.
neither do I.
I wish I knew what I was doing here.
you said you could shed some light on some things.
I meant in terms of Conrad.
I knew something was wrong...
even before he tried suicide.
but I thought that
it's clear that he's very smart.
he's always been an ""A " student.
naturally, I thought intelligent people...
could work out their problems.
but you still feel responsible?
Yeah, sure I do.
it's hard not to.
it was just luck that I happened to be there...
when he tried it.
we both could've been away.
you think of yourself as a lucky man?
no. No, no.
I used to think that I was a lucky person...
before the accident.
I guess the whole of life...
is nothing but an accident
that sounds like the philosophy of a drifter.
Yeah. Maybe.
maybe I am drifting a little.
I can see the two of them...
drifting away from me...
and I just stand watching.
what would you want to do about that?
something. I don't know what.
I feel like I'm sitting on a fence.
they're on opposite sides of this fence?
yeah... No.
I don't know.
I see her not being able to forgive him.
for what?
I don't know exactly.
being too much like her.
people always think that she and Buck are-- were alike.
but it's really she and Conrad.
they were the only two...
that didn't cry at the funeral.
it's not easy for me to admit this...
but, um...
she didn't
his mother doesn't show him much affection.
I'm not trying to put her down.
did she give Buck much affection?
God, yes. She loved Buck.
Bucky got so much.
what she felt for him was special.
he was her first-born.
and you?
I loved Buck.
I mean your wife's affection.
for me?
Yes.
she's very
no, there's no problem with her for me.
we've been married nearly 2 1 years.
everybody loves Beth.
for Conrad, it's been difficult.
he didn't talk about that?
we don't know what happens here.
it doesn't come up.
I guess that's what it is.
it's private here, isn't it?
Mm-hmm. Very private.
I think I know why I came here.
I think I came here to talk about myself.
okay. Why don't we?
Hi.
what's the matter?
this will sound strange.
what I'm going to say will sound strange.
what happened?
come inside.
could we talk about Buck's funeral?
what?
it'll seem trivial, but it's on my mind.
I'd like to talk about it.
when I was getting dressed for Buck's funeral
what could getting dressed for Buck's funeral...
have to do with anything?
I was wearing a blue shirt.
you said, ""Wear a white shirt and other shoes. "
it was nothing, but it seemed to stay with me.
what difference did it make...
what I wore to Buck's funeral?
hear me out, Beth!
no one would listen to that.
I just want to talk about it.
why do you want to remind me?
because I've wondered what it mattered what I wore.
I was crazy that day.
we were going to our son's funeral.
you were worried about what I wore on my feet.
it sticks with me...
and I wanted to tell you about it.
it's all right.
Beth! How are you?
fine. How are you?
I haven't seen you.
I'll call you. How's Brad?
fabulous! Is everything okay?
isn't this madness?
it gets worse every year.
good-bye.
may I show you this in your size?
what?
may I show you this?
Oh, no. No, thanks.
Bennetts, Grants, and Foleys.
Conrad should get something for my parents.
he's not getting something for his doctor, is he?
we should go see Dr. Berger.
what?
we could all go see him.
Why?
he thinks it's a good idea.
what's he know about me?
I've never even met him.
wouldn't it be easier if we all talked about it?
what will we talk about?
don't try to change me.
hasn't enough happened?
let's hold on to what we've got.
that's what this is for.
maybe you'll be surprised.
I don't want surprises.
I know I'm not perfect.
if I can't hug everybody like you, I'm sorry.
you're missing the point.
I don't want to see counselors.
this is my family.
we will solve our problems...
in the privacy of our own home...
not by running to some
ready to order?
could you give me a few minutes?
running to experts every time something goes wrong.
I know you mean well.
I want this to be a nice Christmas.
I want them all to be nice.
you and I need time together.
we must get away.
new Years', we'll spend time in Houston...
with my brother.
play some golf, relax.
I've talked to Mother.
Conrad can stay with them.
please don't worry about it.
please, for his sake, don't indulge him.
we need time together.
okay?
okay.
okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
let's just give things time, okay?
okay.
hmm?
I don't bowl.
I'm a horrible bowler.
that's all right.
Yeah. Well
I got it.
the thing is, I'm a funny bowler.
listen, we don't have to go bowling.
I'm not a bowling nut.
how funny are you?
on a scale from 1 to 1 0-- About a 1 0.
that's pretty funny.
I promise you won't look silly.
guarantee it?
guarantee it.
can you break the ball?
can't break anything in a bowling alley.
that's what I like about bowling alleys.
can't even break the record.
anyway
hmm? What?
it's a conversation starter.
catchy.
you like it?
I've been working on it all day.
are people punished for things they do?
by God?
Yeah.
I don't believe in God.
not at all?
either you do or don't.
I believe in God.
you afraid he'll punish you for something?
I've done many things I'm ashamed of.
yeah? So have I.
did it hurt?
I don't remember really.
you don't want to talk about it?
I've never really talked about it.
to doctors, but not to anyone else.
you're the first who's asked.
why did you do it?
uh
I don't know. It was like...
falling into a hole.
it was like falling into a hole.
it keeps getting bigger...
and you can't escape.
all of a sudden, it's inside...
and you're the hole.
you're trapped, and it's all over.
something like that.
it's not really scary...
except when you think back on it.
cause you know what you were feeling
Hey, Jarrett.
how you doing? How about some fries?
what are you doing?
Hey, lighten up.
Hey, I don't like your attitude.
energetic, those guys.
they were pretty funny.
no.
you thought they were.
no, I
I'm sorry.
what for?
anyway
do you want to talk?
about what?
are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll give you a call.
will you? I want you to.
sure.
well
I'll see you in choir.
okay. Yeah.
Thanks.
okay.
I mean, good night.
good night.
seven.
in preparation for our landing in Houston, observe the fasten seat belt sign, and no smoking until well inside the terminal.
watch this.
pessimistic golfer.
pessimistic golfer.
Oh, damn!
are we two up?
two.
let's hustle up.
it is flat here.
but we decided to teach you to love it.
he wants everybody to move here.
it's good to see you.
you look tired, Cal. - Airplane scotch.
why am I still hungry?
cause you're in Texas.
we'll get you home.
get some steaks on.
a baked potato, too?
how long has he had that drawl?
since joining the club.
it sure wasn't funny.
we weren't that bad.
I can't listen to that Buck Jarrett lecture again.
he bugs me when he does that.
will he ever stop kissing his picture?
Stillman, shut up.
Connie, want a ride?
Oh, no, thanks.
we could've used you today.
I don't think so.
nobody could've helped us.
I hear you got eyes for Pratt.
made it with her yet?
don't be a prick.
you're the prick.
you give me a goddamn pain in the ass.
Connie, come on! Come on!
Connie, that's enough.
No!
No!
let go! Let go!
it's all right!
just calm down.
you're crazy! You know that?
send him back where he came from!
it's over. It's over.
all right!
shit!
here's your hat.
you want to talk?
the guy's a nothing.
he's a zero upstairs.
since fourth grade, you've known that.
so you look stupid...
when you let him get to you!
so I look stupid?
what's with you?
why do you want to be in this alone?
you know, I miss him, too.
the three of us were best friends.
it hurts too much to be around you.
I got to go.
Yeah, okay.
hello.
hello. Is Karen there?
she
hello.
is Karen there?
this is Conrad Jarrett.
I'm a friend of hers.
[ father ] Karen's dead.
what? What?
[ man ] She killed herself.
[ Karen's Voice ] Let's have the best Christmas ever.
we can, you know.
we could have the best year...
of our whole lives.
get the sail down!
keep it starboard!
get the sail down!
starboard!
keep trying!
I can't! Let it out!
let it out!
just keep it starboard!
I can't!
Ahh!
give me your hand!
we screwed up, buddy!
dad's gonna haul ass over this!
it ain't so goddamned funny!
don't let go!
I won't, Buck!
everything will be okay!
hang on, brother!
don't let go!
stay with me!
stay with me!
stay with me!
Oh, God!
[ berger ] Hello.
this is Conrad.
what's going on?
I need to see you.
where are you?
I don't know.
all right.
get to the office.
I'll meet you there.
okay.
good. You're here.
something happened.
just a minute.
wait till we get inside.
shit.
you'd think they'd assume there'd be emergencies.
don't take it off. Just sit down.
something happened.
what?
it's
it's what?
Oh, God!
I need something.
what?
it keeps coming.
I can't stop it!
don't try.
got to get off the hook.
for what?
what I did to him!
what?
it must be somebody's fault...
or there's no point!
what point? It happened!
Oh, no. I don't mean that.
it's just that
Bucky, I didn't mean it.
Bucky, I didn't mean it.
it wasn't your fault.
you said, "Get the sail down! "
I couldn't! It jammed!
and then the halyard jammed!
because the goddamned halyard jammed!
then you're sittin' here screwing around!
until it's too late!
and I'm supposed to take care of it!
that wasn't fair.
No! And then you say, ""Hang on! "
hang on!'
then you let go!
why'd you let go?
I got tired!
yeah? Well, screw you, you jerk!
it hurts to be mad at him.
Yeah.
he just wasn't careful.
he didn't see how a bad thing might happen.
bad things happen even when people are careful.
we should've come in...
when it started to look bad.
so you made a mistake.
why did he let go?
Why?
maybe you were stronger.
did that ever occur to you?
how long will you punish yourself?
when will you quit?
I'd like to.
why don't you?
it's not that easy.
God...
I loved him.
I know.
what happened? What started all this?
she killed herself.
I just found out she's dead.
Jesus.
she was fine.
no. She wasn't.
she told me! She said she was
what?
she was busy and feeling good and
what?
what?
if I'd known...
I could've done something.
you're taking her on, too?
No!
no?
no, I just
what?
that isn't it.
I feel really bad about this.
just let me feel bad about this!
okay.
listen, I feel bad about it, too.
why do things happen to people?
it isn't fair.
you're right. It isn't fair.
you just do one wrong thing...
and
um-hmm.
and what was the one wrong thing you did?
you know.
you know.
I hung on.
I stayed with the boat.
exactly.
now, you can live with that, can't you?
I'm scared!
I'm scared.
feelings are scary.
and sometimes they're painful.
if you can't feel pain...
you won't feel anything else.
you know what I'm saying?
I think so.
you're here. You're alive.
don't say you don't feel that.
it doesn't feel good.
it is good.
believe me.
how do you know?
because I'm your friend.
I don't know what I would've done...
you're really my friend?
I am. Count on it.
Hi.
I would've called...
but I didn't want to wake anyone.
about the other night...
I liked being with you.
I didn't like myself.
Conrad, I was stupid.
that was dumb of me to laugh.
it was my fault.
I was embarrassed.
Really?
you were embarrassed?
when those boys came in...
it was awful and awkward.
when I'm embarrassed, I laugh.
they were just having a good time.
I let them interfere with what was happening.
it was dumb.
I've done lots of dumb things lately.
I just didn't know if you were being straight with me.
yeah?
anyway, I'd like to try it again.
it worked okay...
except for the bowling.
Yes.
yes?
Yes.
are you going to school?
no, not on Sunday.
have you eaten?
no, I haven't.
do you want some breakfast?
okay.
mom!
all right. How about that?
boy, oh, boy.
I do love that.
these holes sure do love you.
we should spend more time playing golf together.
maybe our next vacation-- strictly golf.
Pinehurst, Myrtle Beach.
Pinehurst would be nice.
I think Connie would like Pinehurst.
is that deliberate or just a reflex?
I assumed you meant him, too.
I'm surprised you haven't called him.
I'll call him tonight.
can we have a little drink?
drink, yes. Little, no.
let's finish this.
what?
what you started.
me? There's no point.
he controls you.
he isn't the problem.
isn't he?
no. Let's talk about what's bothering you.
no. Let's discuss what's bothering you.
how did I make you so angry with me?
you blame me for everything.
can't you see beyond yourself?
no, I can't!
neither can you or anybody else!
I'm just honest.
stop being honest...
and start being generous!
think about him!
what does he expect from me?
he wants a hug when he passes exams?
I can't respond when someone says...
I did something great. Love me. "
he wants to know you don't hate him.
mothers don't hate their sons.
is that what he told you?
you accept what he says with no questions.
I'm trying to keep this family
what does everyone want from me?
listen, we all just want you to be happy.
happy?
Yes.
you tell me the definition of happy.
first, be sure your kids are safe...
that nobody's been hit by a car...
or drowned in your swimming pool!
then tell me how to be happy!
I'm turning in.
dinner was good.
really good.
it's early. You tired?
it was a rough week.
your grandmother wasn't too tough on you?
no. She was fine.
I'm glad you're back.
good night.
why are you crying?
can I, uh
can I get you something?
I don't
what did you say?
Calvin, what did you say?
tell me.
you are beautiful.
and you are unpredictable.
but you're so cautious.
you're determined, Beth...
but you know something?
you're not strong.
I don't know if you're really giving.
tell me something.
do you love me?
do you really love me?
I feel the way I've always felt about you.
we would've been all right...
if there hadn't been any mess.
but you can't handle mess.
you need everything neat and easy.
I don't know.
maybe you can't love anybody.
it was so much Buck.
it's as if you buried all your love with him.
I don't understand that.
maybe it wasn't even Buck.
maybe it was just you.
maybe, finally, it was the best of you that you buried.
but whatever it was...
I don't know who you are.
I don't know what we've been playing at.
so I was crying.
because I don't know if I love you anymore.
and I don't know what I'll do without that.
dad?
the yard looks smaller without leaves.
dad, what happened?
your mother's going away for a while.
where?
Why?
back to Houston.
I don't know.
Why? What
I know why.
it's me, isn't it?
no.
it's my fault.
don't do that to yourself!
it's nobody's fault!
things happen. People don't always have answers.
I don't know why I'm yelling at you.
you should do that more often.
haul my ass a little.
get after me.
like you did for him.
he needed it.
you didn't.
you were always so hard on yourself,
I never had the heart.
Oh, Dad, don't.
well, it's the truth.
I never worried about you.
I just wasn't listening.
I wasn't sending many signals then.
you couldn't do anything.
I should've got a handle on it somehow.
I used to figure you had a handle for everything.
you knew it all.
you always made us feel everything would be all right.
I've thought about that a lot lately.
I really admire you for it.
george Merchant. - Self-made millionaire.
fancied himself as a property developer.
said he had big plans for Sandford. - Pissed on the floor in The Crown.
but more importantly, was a good friend and client of...
martin Blower. - Respected solicitor.
Affirmatron. - Leading light of the local drama society.
bad actor. - Undoubtedly.
bad driver. - Not necessarily.
cheated on his missus. - Most certainly.
and we both know who with. - Eve Draper.
blower's leading lady. Distinctive laugh. - True.
favoured older men. - Fingered.
worked at? - Council.
more specifically? - Department of Planning and Development.
where George Merchant secured permission to build his dubious mansion on Norris Avenue.
so...
maybe they were all accidents. People have accidents every day.
what are you two up to? - Nothing.
well, look sharp.
there's been reports of a fire in the station. - What?
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you - Danny, why didn't you say something? - We were working, weren't we?
Hey, where are you going? - Personal errand.
Hello, Miss Tiller.
I was wondering, do you have any Japanese Peace Lilies?
of course.
I was just about to pop off, actually.
I can never find my scissors.
is this for someone special? - Yes. Yes, it is.
are you going somewhere, Miss Tiller? - Yes. I'm moving away.
and why the move, if you don't mind me asking?
well, just between you and I... - Yes?
you know that fella who blew up? - George Merchant.
well, George Merchant, God rest him, wanted to buy this land, so he sends round his legal fella, Martin Blower, God rest him, and I thought I might take them up on it.
I haven't really got that much family round here, save for Cousin Sissy.
so I thought I might take them up on the offer and move to Buford Abbey.
would you like a card with this?
no, sorry, you were talking about the offer?
well, it turns out that Martin Blower, God rest him, knew where the new bypass road is going because he was knocking off Eve Draper from the council, God rest her, and then that reporter, God rest him, finds out about the route and tells me this land's very valuable.
ten times what George Merchant and Martin Blower, God rest them, offered me.
so, with them having passed on, I decided to sell it on myself to some folks from the city that Martin, George and Eve,
God rest the lot of them, had been talking to.
apparently, they want to build a big shopping centre or something.
of course, Cousin Sissy won't be too happy about that, but as far as I'm concerned, Cousin Sissy can go and fuck...
would you just excuse me, for just one second?
stop!
in the name of the law!
hang about, hang about.
you're saying this wasn't an accident?
Leslie Tiller was fucking murdered!
what, just like Tim Messenger? - Yes!
and George Merchant? - Yes!
and Eve Draper? - Yes!
and Martin Blower? - No, actually.
Really? - 'Course he fucking was!
thank you, Danny.
Oh, murder, murder, murder. Change the fucking record.
thank you, Andy.
come on, Sergeant, you've gotta accept it was just another nasty accident.
what are you suggesting?
that Leslie Tiller tripped and fell on her own shears?
Ben Fletcher fell on his pitchfork the other week.
Yeah, accidents happen all the time. What makes you think it was murder?
because I was there! - There's a point.
why were you there?
I was buying Constable Butterman a Japanese Peace Lily for his birthday.
what absolute horseshit.
I chased a suspect from the scene. Innocent people don't run!
here, maybe it was our old friend, the cactus thief.
Oh, yeah, he was a prickly customer, weren't he?
am I going completely mad?
maybe you are.
maybe you did it.
Yeah, seeing as how you're such a big fan of murder.
what the... - Sergeant Angel?
Yes! Sir.
Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas.
what am I going to do with you?
sir, you have to understand... - No, you have to understand.
the boys here aren't used to the concepts you're bandying about.
the "M" word, Nicholas.
there hasn't been a recorded murder in Sandford for 20 years.
but, sir, I'm certain.
and what's more, I know who did it.
can I see the manager, please?
mr Skinner to the Manager's office. Manager's office. Mr Skinner.
sergeant Angel. And to what do I owe this pleasure?
Simon Skinner, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Leslie Tiller.
Leslie Tiller's dead? How?
she tripped and fell on her own shears.
I'm also arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Tim Messenger on May 1st, of George Merchant on April 29th and of Eve Draper and Martin Blower on April 28th.
why on earth would I do that, Sergeant? - I'm glad you asked.
my suspicions were first aroused when you appeared at the scene of the Blower-Draper death, on the outskirts of Sandford, despite the fact you live and work in the centre of the village.
I couldn't help but recall your comments at the theatre on the previous evening.
when you not only indicated an awareness of the couple's affair but also inferred that Eve's connections at the council might make her privy to important information.
you even spoke of "bashing her head in.
perhaps hoping you might discover the route of the proposed Sandford Bypass.
you were already suspicious that George Merchant was buying up a large area of land on the outskirts of Sandford, after an article Tim Messenger wrote in the Sandford Citizen.
you see, the land Merchant was buying had little value in of itself but, if it became accessible by road, it would be a prime location for say, a retail park.
consumed with concern for your business and potential disloyalty from fickle customers, you yourself expressed a wish to behead.
you killed the competition in cold blood.
staging the murders as accidents.
you used a vehicle removal truck to stage the Blower-Draper death and incinerated an old man in his own house.
covering your tracks with the judicial application of bacon and beans.
however, there was a loose end.
tim Messenger.
splattered before he could share with me what he told Leslie Tiller that very afternoon.
the true value of her land.
upon discovering she was about to sell up to the developers, you brutally murdered her with her own shears.
and made good your escape utilising your impressive skills as a fun runner.
very entertaining. But I rather think you've been watching too many films.
he hasn't.
why would I kill Leslie? You clearly aren't aware that we're related.
Oh, but I am, "Cousin Sissy.
I'm afraid my nickname of Sissy is only a revelation to yourself.
my teenage years studying ballet are well known.
