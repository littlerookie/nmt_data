Oh, have you come to surrender?

all your work to bring Sentinel back.
and now clearly he has all the power.
it's actually almost tragic.
you dare lecture me, slave.
your decepticons finally conquering this planet.
and yet their leader wasn't you.
it will be me, it will always be me.
any minute now.
they'll be laughing.
you're Sentinels bitch.

all of us.
but here,
please.
they'll only be one.
this is MY planet.
I just saved a whole other world.

huh, you think you're a hero.
no.
I'm just a messenger.
it's still connected.
watch, wait up.
lets lock it that.
no.
we need a truce.
all I wanted was to be back in charge.
besides...
who would you be without me?
prime.
time to find out.
Optimus. All I ever wanted, was the survival of our race.
you must see why I had to betray you.
you didn't betray me.
you betrayed yourself.
no, Optimus!
Sam.
I love you.
I love you.
you're the only thing I need in this world.
and I'll do anything to make it up to you, I promise.
I'm gonna hold you to that.
just never let me go.
promise.
rings.
I love this car.
but, you gotta slow down.
you gotta slow way down. Okay.
I'm just trying to help out.
in any war.
there are calms, between storms.
you fought bravely. - There will be days when we loose faith.
days when our allies turn against us.
but the day will never come.
that we forsake this planet.
and it's people.
did you get out? - Yeah. Yeah, we're at the corner.
where are you?
I'm sorry I had to do this.
you think will framed us for this?
will apologizeright before e museum exploded, and our faces are on tv.
I'm not gonna see you again?
Jay, you can't run from this.
I need to figure out who will traveler really is.
seems traveler has left us quite a mess.
you know what to do.
he's an undercover federal agent.
he's one of us.
we already know about you and maya getting involved.
don't! Will will! He's got a gun!
maybe we were supposed to die in the drexler.
what are you saying, jay, that my father wanted to kill us?
no, not until I hear him tell me.
you take off now, I won't be here when you get back
don't do this.
I have to.
he's running!
out of the way!
5 Days 10 Hours since Drexler Bombing New York wait, wait, wait!
FBI! Get out of the way!
Where'd he go?
I don't know.
there!
suspect heading west on 53rd. I need backup!
Boston Massachusetts
couldn't bring me in yourself, jimmy?
had to leave it to alex?
look, obviously there's been some kind of, uh...misunderstanding why'd you tell alex I was coming? Somebody pay you?
come on, will.
I'm just a supplier to you guys.
you know I don't ask questions.
any sign of him?
this is chambers.
we lost tyler fog heading west on 55th street.
I want roadblocks, bridge and tunnel closures-- whatever I can get.
and tell N. Y.P. D.I need bodies down here now.
all right.
I'm gonna kill you, man.
this is your last chance to tell me what you know.
I told you, I don't know nothing, okay?
I don't know crap.
I swear.
where you going, man?
what areou doing, will?
don't do it, okay?
will, you don't want to do this!
all right, all right! I know something, okay?
I know something. It's about maya.
okay, the guy who killed your girl?
he stopped here for supplies on his way to deer harbor.
who is he?
I don't know!
I don't know, okay?!
No! Oh, god!
okay!
I don'know his name.
all I know is he's got brownair and he's all inked up, and he's out of new york. Okay?
that's all I know.
we good?
Yeah.
where you going, will?
what are you doing? You gotta let dowN.
you've reached kim's cell. Leave a message.
please, uh, kim, I-I-I don't know where jay is, and I-I-I thought that you might, and...
and I don't--I don't know-I don't know if he was at eddie hahn's when the
when the-- when the fbi got there.
I went back to get him, and I guess I was just -
if you're satisfied with your message, please press 1.
all agents and officers, gather around.
if fog is in the area, then burchell must be close.
I want random vehicle checks and a 3-mile grid search.
anyone answering to fog's description, anyone wearing a hat, any male between the ages of and 60, stop him.
search him.
transit police are covering the subways.
we're gonna get this guy tonight.
let's go!
borjes, any news on fog?
I'll be right there.
from the scene of a foot chase that took place on the upper east side, fbi officials have refused to confirm reports that they were pursuing drexler bombing suspect tyler fog, saying only that both fog and suspect jay burchell are still at large.
what do we got?
N. Y.P. D. Spotted it on roosevelt avenue in queens, brought it here.
V. I.N. Number confirms that it's fog'S.
no idea when fog left it there, huh?
street cleaning was yesterday.
it would have been towed any time before that.
and nothg inside that explains why they would have come back to new york?
not that I could see.
why abandon the vehicle in queens?
fog was in the city, not exactly nearby. Doesn't track.
anything else?
you heard that surveillance picked up a phone message fog left for burchell girlfriend?
Yeah. Seems like fog doesn't even know where burchell is.
kim doherty's from queens, right?
chambers said that he convinced her to move back in with her folks.
you think this is just about burchell's girl?
we already know about your indiscretions, will...
you and mayaetting involD.
will please!
let her go. - Unfortunately...
what? ease. I-I talked to him!
No!
I-I told you.
I told you!
it was a recording, will.
I killed her two hours ago.
I killed her two hours ago.
please! No!
I'm gonna kill you, I swear to god.
queens, New York mr. Doherty, I'm agent jan marlow
no. No more.
you have put my daughter through-- - sir, I know this has been a difficult time for your family, but I have some new information on tyler fog and jay burchell.
if ian just talk to kim...
talk to my lawyer.
dad, wait.
let her in.
make sure to check it out, man. See what she says.
this is about making it right.
it's abo securing the future of this family.
without me?
you're not strong enough, tyler.
what can I get ya?
three shots of whiskey and a bottle of stout.
you know, I figure i going down.
might as well dull the pain as mucas possible, right?
what was that?
forget it.
Yeah, that'sight.
I'm him.
let me guess. The man of my dreams, right?
afraid I've heard th one before.
have you?
well, maybe this time it's true.
Thanks.
you have news about jay?
Tyler fog was spotted in manhattan.
the news said that wasn't-- - it wasas tyler.
we found his car less than a mile from here.
fingerprints place jay inside.
wait. Jay's here?
well, that's what we're trying to determine.
have you heard from jay or seen him in the last 24 hours?
no.
well, what about tyler? Heard from him?
no.
well, it must be nice having your family around in the mide of all this.
I guess.
my dad's a little, uh...
well, you met him.
he just wants to protect you...
just like you want to protect jay.
thing is, you can't protect him, but I can.
I can protect him.
as long as he's on the run, he's a moving target.
but if he turns himself in-- - then what?
I can help him, see that he's treated fairly, that proper procedure is followed when he comes in.
that doesn't aays happen with terror suspects.
something else, kim.
I know you were telling the truth about will traveler.
what?
I know will exists, and I think he's still alive.
and if you're right that he set jay and tyler up in the drexler, then I think that will might still a threat to them.
if jay does try to contact you, give me a call, day or night.
does this routine usually work for you? - No.
wait, routine? - Yeah.
Ller. Ouch. Let's get out of here, baby.
wait, this is what you call okay?
Seriously?
you got a problem, bro? - No. No, unh-unh.
no, n't, because actually while you were over there doing shots, I was -
I was over here enjoying this beautiful woman's company, so, actually, I think it's you who's got the problem.
I got a problem.
whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, okay. No problems, man.
nobody's got any problems, all right?
come on, let's go, skinny, you and me. Let's dance outside, bro.
there's myoor.
see ya, man.
Dudewhat is your problem, man?
I had that.
Oh, you had that.
easy, tough Y. That guy had 30 pounds on you.
please. I got skills, man.
I think you need to quit pulling this crap, 'cause one of these days I might not be around to save your ass it's already paid for.
I didn't order any-- - it's already paid for.
I want that info now.
you should've told me you were gonna question kim doherty.
I didn't plan on it, sir, but when we found fog's car, I put two and two together.
I didn't want to waste any time.
Wasttime?
what about all the time I've spent cultivating doherty as a witness, marlow?
you consider that a waste? - Sir, I
what, are you trying to make yourself look better, trying to cut me out of the loop?
no.
good.
don't.
listen, um, my shift's ending.
if you wouldn't mind settling your tab.
Hey, uh...
anyone ever tell you you look like that bomr guy?
uh...Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. I've been getting that a l this week.
I wasn't sure if you were gonna come.
neither was I.
I missed you.
what? - I don't know.
Hey, t's me.
talk to me please. Please.
just...
you don't know what it's been like since you left.
I know.
I know it hasn't been easy for you.
I'm sorry.
got a plan, okay?
and soon everything--everything will get back to norL.
normal?
nothing is normal, jay. - Okay.
everything is different. Everything is gone. - No.
yeah-- - no kim.
your career, my career--gone.
our apartment--gone.
our life together Gone... - no. no.
because you ran!
look, I said I would come back to you, and I did.
I got a message...from tyler.
what did he say?
that he was looking for you.
he say wheree was?
no.
Carlton fog set us up. - What?
Tyler's dad knew about the drexler bombing in advance.
Tyler didn't want to believe it, but...
I'm pretty sure carlton fog's been in on this from the beginning.
Tyler's father?
that's-- - it's crazy, I know. I know.
I don't know if I can do this on my own.
you don't have to.
that woman from the fbi came to see me today-- agent marlow.
Jay, she knows about will.
I think she believes there's more to this, that it's not your fault.
did u bring your camera like I asked?
I found this stuff in will's lockbox.
Wow. Will sure had us fooled.
damn.
what?
there aren't any pictures on this.
you're right, but it does have aaudio file.
my camera's got a speaker, so...
there is one aspect of this that we haven't discussed, and that's your roommates.
they will be framed for the bombing...
and they are expected to die in the blast.
ohmy god.
is that gonna be a problem for you?
no. Not at all.
good, because there's no room for error, will.
the drexler's just the first step in a much larger plan.
your country appreciates it.
Thanks.
you think burchell and fog coming to new york ias.
has anything to do with our john doe?
possible.
I got N. Y.P. D. Watching the apartment where we found him.
still no hits on the B. O.L. O.
come here.
you tell anybody he was a fed? - Not yet.
I'm still waiti to see if any of my leads pan out, but I think chamrs ought to know, don't you?
of course.
it's just...
what?
it's just that I think it might be a good idea to keep a lid on this for a while.
pursue it on your own.
call it an itinct. - Instinct?
we're talking about defying procedure here.
we're talking about an ex-fbi agent who escaped from our custody and killed one of our people.
he's a subject of interest in the drexler bombing.
what if this guy still has contacts inside the agency?
the minute you run this up the chain of command -
whaley and his contacts start covering their tracks.
why would will keep a recording that implicates him in the drexler bombing and in this much larger plan?
well, and what does that even mean?
more bombings?
I don't know.
maybe.
wait. What are you doing?
going to the fbi.
Oh, jay, it is the right thing to do.
they almost caught tyler today.
it is just a matter of time, and agent marlow said that she could help protect you
protect me?
I-I mean, if you turned yourself in, she id that she
no, turning myself in is...
not exactly what I had in mind.
Carter's Ink Brooklyn, New York
that's me.
you work late?
you'd be surprised the number of peoe who get drunk and decide they want a tattoo at 1: 00 in the morning.
happy to help 'em out.
first tat?
I'm told this is your work.
Hey, you know, it is gettin' kind of late.
but you just said that-- - thing is, my time is valuable.
if you're not a paying customer...
know you're not lookin' for a bribe, ed.
no, not me.
Yeah, I did those.
on who?
guy's called martin.
that a first name or a last name?
don't know.
when did you do his tattoos?
still doin' 'em.
takes a while to do a sleeve that elaborate.
there's only so much pain a guy can take.
Martin's got a higher tolerance for pain than most.
when did you see him last?
mm, about a week ago.
he's in and out of town, so it's taking me a while to get them finished.
you know where I can find him?
ID he stays there-- hotel regal.
Thanks.
Hi, kim. Everying okay?
I need to talk...in person.
I'm on my way.
whoa. Where are you going?
kim doherty. She's seen jay. I know it.
well, hold on.
I'll roll with you.
I don't want to spook her.
if it checks out I'll call you in.
Borjes, I've got three tyler fog sightings within a 2-block radius of 42nd street andth avenue, all within the last five minutes.
make that four.
everybody, let's go!
pull up live feeds of every traffic camera in the area.
come on, come on.
there!
who is that girl?
get me a visual I. D. Cross-check with the D. M.V.
I want her name. I want to know where she lives, everything about her.
where are they?
43rd and 7th, heading south.
all right, I want all available agents on the scene, and notify local police units in the area now.
we got him.
42nd and 7th, southwest corner heading east.
times square. Where are all the damnops?
all units in the area have been notified, sir.
should be any second now.
they're not going anywhere.
it's a live feed, right?
there is a 30-second streaming delay.
notify transit police.
suspend all subway service out of times square.
almost every linin the city goes through there.
with a 30-second lead, they-- - fog could headed anywhere in the city by now.
Damn!
agent marlow.
should we talk inside? - Actually, uh, no, um, I can't talk.
I have to get going.
I tried to call.
I didn't get a message.
sorry.
so sorry.
go back.
push in.
got a name on this girl yet?
so far, no matches with the D. M.V.
sir, doesn't it strike you as odd?
what?
doesn't it strike you as odd that in the middle of all this, tyler fog is on a date?
we need to talk.
certainly.
bring it back up.
maybe we missed something.
who was that?
robert cole, head of O. P.R.
handles employee misconduct.
thought cole was out of D. C.
what's he doing here?
I don't know.
Carlton FOG:"I JUST WANTED TO HELP MY SON
just tell me, dad, that you didn't try to have us killed.
this is the real world, tyler, and there are choices that have to be made.
some of those choices are bigger than you.
yeah? - It's marlow.
stay here d watch the house.
I'm on this.
Roger that.
come on!
you killed her.
who?
I don't know who you're taln' abo.
that's the worst part.
then you know that I was just followin' orders.
who gave the order?
I said who gave e order?!
who are we working for?!
freed gives all the orde.
look, hometown's been shutown for two years.
Freed's used us for his own agen.
you don't want me. Huh?
go after freed.
you got something he wants.
please.
you made the right decision.
your girl mary would have appreciated that.
her name was maya.
borjes my office.
why didn't you tell you soug increed security clearance to investigate our escapee?
and when that failed, you receed covert assistance from an N. S.A. Agent...
agent fowler was friend, sir.
his death...
I took it personally, and I took it upon myself to fd out whatever I could about the man who killed him.
I'm sorry th I strayed from procedure, but
no apoloes necessary.
sir?
N. S.A.?
very resourceful.
I'm impressed.
thank you.
still, this guy-- what's his name--whaley?
I know agent stone told youhaley's ex-fbi.
what I don't know is why you went to stone about this at all.
I could have gotten you that information without alerting O. P.R.
I'm sorry, sir. With burchell and fog in the city
unlike your partner, you've got an immaculate reco.
don't ruin it.
agent marlow has made it clear she wants my job.
but you're former military.
you respect the chain of command, correc yes, sir.
good.
I want a full repo on whaley by morning.
wi do.
who's that man with my father?
don't know him.
I think he's up from D. C.
Carlton fog with homeland security's jack freed.
Homelansecurity's jack freed, former deputy director, I.
this is proof, man, something to take to the fbi agent marlow!
I don't want to hurt you.
I ju want to talk.
I'listening.
we didn't have anything to do with the drexler bombing.
we were set up, and I haveroof.
Hello? - Kim, it's tyler.
listen to me. - Uh, you're breaking up. I'll cl you back.
Kim? - Are you crazy?
my phone's tapped.
Kim, listeto me, okay?
there's this guy jack freed. He's fbi.
he used to be deputyirector for god sake, okay?
now I think...
I know he's mixed up in this. - What?
he's on a list of ople who sold holloway stock before the drexler bombing.
listen, my father is working witthe fbi, trng to haves killed.
now before I took off, jay said he was goingo the fbi.
now you can't let hi that.
no, it's too late.
what? What do you mean?
he's meeting with agent marlow w at...at fervor.
on 14th? - Yeah, uh-huh.
okay, I'm going down there now.
Oh, my god.
you are that bomber guy.
looks like you got it all figured out.
I gotta hand it to you, burche.
not a bad place to meet--loud, dark, easy to get lostn the crowd.
Anluringe here...
you and your girlfriend make a good team.
kim had nothing to do with this.
it was my idea.
what's this?
names of people who sold holloway insurance, who profited from the drexler bombing, a few of will traveler's fake passports.
I see.
that's nothing.
this is a recording ofome guy named joseph telling will to blow up the drexler, saying he should frame tyler and me for doing it, and thdrexler is just the rst step in a much larger plan.
It'sll very interesting, jay.
this could exonete you.
turn around and place your hands on your head!
look, I told you we've been set up.
if you just listen to that recording
unfortunately, this is about more than just the drexler now.
you're suspected of murder, not to mention the kidnapping of tyler'susiness school friend eddie hahn.
Jay, don't move!
everybody, stay calm!
this is marlow.
I've got jay burchell at fervor on 14th street.
1013, 1013, suspt jay burchell has been spotted at club fervor.
I repeat--suspect jay burchell has been spotted aclub fervor.
burchell's been spotted in the aly.
copy that. I'm on my way.
freeze put yo han where can see them.
you drop the gun!
I said droyour gun! - Tyler!
come on, tyler.
let this man go and surrender peacefully.
we can straighten this out.
Jay, she's lying.
they're in on this.
what areou talking about?
Jay, you have to believe me. The fbi is involved. I have proof.
Yeah, yeah. See? She knows!
right, What I know is that you were telling the truth about will travele we've got him on video.
I know you were telling the truth abt will, and I think you were telling e truth about the drexler, and with the evidence you showed me tonight -
Jay, jay! You don't believe her. You have to trust me.
now you do as I say. You drop that gun!
co on, tyler, you're not gonna shoot anyone!
no, but I will.
I'm saying I need to take a moment to myself here.
musically or what?
it's just the music. It's like I said.
would you rather it was the other way?
that we broke up but kept playing together?
Why? We're just starting to hit our stride.
I need to stretch myself, you know?
I have to play in different styles.
we're not practicing anymore.
we're not working on arrangements. - What the fuck, Annie?
you're drunk or high half the time.
I mean, personally I'm not your mother
and I wouldn't complain about it.
it's just it's hard to play music when you're like that.
you got gigs lined up? - No.
bullshit! This is bullshit, Annie. - Okay, it's bullshit.
but I think we should take a break from playing together.
without me you got no front man. You don't sing much.
you got nothing but the fiddle. - I'll do what I can.
so what, I go out on the street
and you go play somewhere else and then we crawl into bed
at the end of the day like it's no big deal?
Sonny, it's no big deal. - Fuck no.
we play together.
if we don't play together, we aren't together.
Sonny, please. - Either you're with me or you're not.
get your shit out of my apartment. - Sonny, I
go! Just get your shit and go.
professor Bernet.
Mr. Loomis. - You gonna be late?
want me to fill in for you? - No, Ben.
I believe I'll fulfill my obligation for today.
sorry. - No worries.
I'm not one of those militant ex-smokers.
it's good you quit. - Because of my size?
Yeah, tobacco would be one more bullet in the chamber.
shall we?
this book is really old.
Yes, it is.
but "the awakening"'s human concerns are as relevant today
as they were at the end of the 19th century.
Hey, at least it's short.
Yeah, thank you, Professor Bernette.
true.
so I want you to take your time with it.
pay attention to the language itself, the ideas.
don't think in terms of a beginning and an end,
because unlike some plot-driven entertainments,
there is no closure in real life. Not really.
you said that all books are about a problem
that the protagonist has to solve.
or a quest.
the protagonist is looking for something.
so what's Edna looking for?
Edna's journey is...
she's looking for truth
or some kind of peace.
now what can you all tell me about the author?
she was a local?
Kate Chopin lived all over Louisiana
new Orleans, Natchitoches parish.
she was the daughter of a Galway man,
creole -- mostly on her mother's side.
she was colored?
creole in the old sense of creole.
professor Bernette, I know that
class participation is 10% of our grade,
but are the discussions themselves going to be on the test too?
Gwyneth, my dear,
everything will be on the test. And the test will be everything.
but fear not,
for in the end every one of us will be tested
and every one of us will be found wanting.
a man on the phone tells me he regrets to inform me that my son is dead.
I told him I am looking at my only son right there in the kitchen?
what did he say to that, Miss cherry?
he said, huh?
just like that -- huh?
then he asked to speak to my son and I put Jerome on.
the man says, is this Jerome Cherry?
I say so and he asks if I was locked up
in the Orleans parish.
I tell him I never been locked up anywhere, not in my whole life.
what did he say to that? - He said "thank you" and hung up.
this caller give a name? - He gave it,
but I didn't pay it no never mind.
and I suppose you didn't have any reason to talk to Ladonna or her mother about this phone call, did you?
didn't talk to no one.
I just figured they had the wrong Jerome Cherry.
you're saying it was my cousin Daymo they had under my name.
crazy.
watch yourself coming through, mama.
the bulk of my weight is back here.
all of this is gonna go to auction.
I sold the walk-in already,
but we still have the prep tables,
the hoods, ventilation.
is there a significant value here?
I'll get something.
and whatever the amount, it'll come right back to you, I promise.
honey, that's not why I was king.
daddy's just concerned about you, not the money.
Oh, don't worry about me. I'll be fine.
I'm already on to the next thing.
which is?
I've been taking my act on the road -- guerrilla chef.
I got a kitchen on wheels.
I've done four events ready.
I've netted myself almost $1, 500.
that much?
on a good night I could clear as much profit
as I did at the restaurant even without the liquor markup.
Bacchanal?
wine store -- in the courtyard they have in the back.
you guys should stay an extra day and come.
I'll show you how it works.
so you're staying in the restaurant business?
what else would I do with myself?
aside from moving back to Huntsville
and getting married to some lumpy lawyer
and popping out grandkids, one after the next?
would that be so bad?
I'm sorry, guys.
I'd rather have my head dipped in duck fat
and shoved in a French oven.
man, why you gotta do that, man?
I knocked, dude.
I see you've got smiley cranked to, like, 11.
that's Huey Smith on ivories, not Billy fucking Joel.
you can't listen to that shit pianissimo.
what -- what's up, man?
I'm having a record release party on account of my E. P. ?
new Orleans gold that is,
meaning I'm still getting consignment checks two months later.
anyway, we need to have a celebration to cure the postmortem?
there ain't been an epic throw-down - around the way since Carnival. - Subtle as ever.
my party plan is basic: Only musicians and hot women are invited.
musicians for a jam session, hot women for reasons requiring no elaboration.
musicians, hot women...
lose the musicians, I think you got something there.
you know nothing of my alchemy.
live music is what brings women, fool.
come on, we gotta go run some of these off,
get them up on telephone poles.
Oh, I need a keg and a bag of endo, so...
but you're going in with me, right?
shit, Davis. I don't know.
come on, man! - All right!
all right, I'm in, man. - You got it, man.
where to?
they wanted him to stay Jerome Cherry,
because if he stayed Jerome Cherry in that refrigerated trailer,
then no one would come looking for him.
but why, Toni?
because something happened in that parish jail
that they don't want us to know about,
something more than your brother falling off his bunk and hitting his head.
see? Look at this.
common nud -- what does that mean?
the injury was to the back of the head
which could be from a fall, but it could also be
that he was struck with a blunt instrument or kicked in the head.
I promise you, Ladonna, we're gonna get to some kind of truth. - Please. Please.
I know this hurts right now.
I know it must feel like all you wanna do - Is mourn for David, but... - Toni.
...It's important,
before you go any further with funeral arrangements,
that we have a chance to do an independent autopsy.
no.
Ladonna, given the circumstances of David's
Oh no, Toni, no.
I'm going out to see the cemetery people tomorrow.
Daymo going home this weekend.
we'll have an autopsy done before then, I promise you.
no. Now see, you're trying to find out
if Daymo got beat on in that prison upstate, right?
what if he did?
what if he got beat on by some inmate or by a guard even?
what then, huh?
you think getting my family all riled up over what might have happened to Daymo was gonna make this any easier?
hell no.
all this mess gonna do is make it harder.
it's about right and wrong, Ladonna.
the boy is dead.
it stays wrong for us no matter what else happens.
and giving my mama somebody to blame and hate on
only makes it harder to get past it.
Ladonna, please, just think about this.
that's all I'm asking.
Hey. Annie?
you leave or did he --?
can I stay for a night or two until I figure something out?
Yeah, no problem... - Thank you.
...if that sofa works for you. - Yeah.
I mean, I don't think we're all gonna fit in here once Dena gets back off her tour.
she uses this front room to rehearse. - Of course.
just a couple of days.
I need to go back for the rest of my stuff once I know where I'm going.
after I told him I didn't want to play with him,
he just went off on me.
Annie, you told Sonny you didn't want to play music with him?
well, for now, yeah.
just until he gets his shit together.
but so what? It wasn't like I was trying to break us up.
I mean, I'm not asking to fuck anyone else,
just gig with them, you know?
Yeah, I don't know.
you know, fucking is fucking,
but music...
that's personal.
time is short.
we gotta hurry if I'm gonna make it out the door.
it always comes down to the last minute, daddy.
it always comes down to everyone in the family
working like crazy so you could take that walk.
I'm surprised you ain't got Sherry and the kids up in here working.
are you gonna blame a man for wanting to have his loving family together?
every year we're working on a better vision.
you gonna be pretty, Albert.
my first year not having a whole new suit.
can't believe what that storm did.
you got us up in here sweatin'
and now you're gonna get extra particular?
I don't want you to think I don't appreciate your efforts.
the truth is we all gotta make do with some of last year's suits.
man, at least you all got enough to make do.
I ain't got nothing yet.
I'm just saying where's my suit?
that's all. - Shit.
boy, you trippin'.
you got to earn that one, son.
I felt the same way when I was younger,
seeing my father walk out the door
on St. Joseph's night all bold and proud,
suit sparkling in the streetlight.
I wanted to be making that walk with him.
I just wanna mask with you all, that's all.
you're not ready.
not just yet.
next year then.
if you're thinking about next year, you gotta get ready now.
hold up, fellas. Hold up.
Hey, Janette. Come on in.
Hey, Jon. Hey, guys. - Hey.
I thought you might bring a little taste with you.
we'll have something nice for you and the fellas tomorrow night.
I know big d's looking forward to that.
so what is on the menu anyway?
whatever looks fresh at the market in the morning
apps, three entrees, dessert.
last time I cooked at bacchanal I did maybe 100 plates,
but this time with you guys
I'm hoping to pack the place.
cool, let's go for it. - So we should firm it up.
what do you say to $1, 000 for the night?
uh, I would say $1, 200.
it's a small venue, but we need at least that just to plug in.
I could use a break. - That is a break, baby.
okay, all right.
all right, all right. - Bye.
looking forward to sampling your fare.
looking forward to it. - See ya.
let's run that little baseline again. Three, four.
Yeah. Relentless, d.
relentless.
you have to come.
Hi, my name is Davis. Will you come to my party?
you come too, man. All right?
brother Antoine, I hate to interrupt your meal, but you gotta come to this.
what that is?
um, just the party of the year.
we'll be jamming till the break of dawn.
all right, I'll try to be there.
who's this here?
that's my daughter, man, Honore? - Dude
her mama was supposed to meet up with me
and get her before the gig, but she's late.
dude, she's done up like a pork chop, man.
Aw, damn, girl, what is you doing?
Oh, no no no no!
that was so me Mardi Gras before last.
Hey, Davis, do me a favor. - I was out
grab me some paper towels or something.
I'd love to help. Got a few more stops to make.
sorry, bro. She's cute. - Bro!
she's really cute. - You better not run away.
later.
dinner's ready, daddy.
I just wanna finish this paragraph.
I'll be in in a minute.
good as gold.
Hey, come on!
all right!
I, uh -- I thought you were gonna be out.
I decided to stick around in case you needed some help with your stuff.
you working on something?
a couple of songs.
okay, the seeds of songs, but yeah.
I've been thinking I need to write some original stuff.
how's it going?
fine.
you've been in my head, Annie.
the taxi's double-parked.
I'll be back in a few days to get the rest of this and drop my key off.
I want you to keep that key.
I'd better go.
look, I made a mistake.
put that down for a minute.
let's talk about it. - I can't right now.
you need some time, I'm with that.
so -- so what about I call you?
maybe we could meet somewhere for coffee.
coffee would be all right.
we did take 4' of water.
why we ain't heard a damn thing about this until now?
I got to bring my brother up in here this weekend.
ma'am, we've been sending letters since late January.
you're joking, right?
my mama lives on valence street.
she still ain't getting mail regularly.
we're gonna fix this, ma, okay?
don't worry.
we got the perpetual care, right?
sure, which provides for gravesite care under basic situations.
but with an act of God such as a hurricane,
there's nothing in the perpetual care pack
damn.
you know who you sound like?
allstate, yeah.
come on, ma.
you need to sit somewhere. I'll deal with this.
how could David -- - I'll fix it, ma.
I will.
Hey, neighbor.
Hi.
heaven must be like this.
the Ohio players.
it's the bad solo jam off of "skin tight."
so I'm having a party tonight, my crib.
we gotta work tonight.
but we'll come over after.
anything we can bring?
your... Personalities.
thank you!
see you tonight.
see ya.
thank you. Thank you! Yes!
Mr. Lambreaux.
I'm sergeant Maurice Thompson from community relations.
Mm-hmm. - You remember we met back at Calliope, right?
this here's lieutenant Colson. - What can I do for you two?
you mind if we have a word? - Outside.
I see you're working hard on your suits in there.
look, Mr. Lambreaux, this thing between Indians and police goes back a long ways.
but last year it got really ugly on St. Joseph's.
we don't want to see it going there again.
we're trying to keep something alive here
and you all trying not to see it.
now that's on you all. - No, that's on both sides, chief.
now you know damn when the Indians put those suits on,
go out in the street, they ignore everything the police tell them.
I understand pride, officers, but it seems that your gang don't think
anyone other than themselves is entitled to any.
pride got you beat up that day at the Calliope,
got you swinging on a patrolman.
it was me that received the first blow.
look, chief, you're out on bail because you hit a cop and everyone knows it.
now it's clear nothing I say is gonna stop you or your gang
from coming out on St. Joseph's night,
stepping into traffic, moving without a permit.
and that means that any street cop
could think they'd get a free shot if they wanted.
you saying your people coming for us, huh? - No no.
I'm saying that I'm worried.
now last year I watched this thing spin out of control.
now maybe because of that,
maybe because of what happened after with big chief Tootie,
I was told to come up with a tactical plan for this year,
stop it all from happening again.
well, son, what's your plan?
hell if I know.
but I do remember before he fell out at the council meeting,
big chief Tootie was talking about the old days.
you remember?
he talked about how the police would be tightening the straps
and he would tell his gang not to look at them,
to step past the fight if they could.
big chief Tootie died on the battlefield.
it might have been the city council chamber to you,
but it was the battlefield for us.
but Tootie wasn't looking for a battle that day.
he was looking for some other way.
you giving your gang the same message you're bringing mine?
I'm trying to.
and the damn contract we got for perpetual care is like 20 pages?
crazy.
you call Toni Bernette?
that lawyer might could help.
I ain't doing no more lawyers.
all I need is to move that funeral back a week
and find the money to get that crypt fixed up before then.
that's an I gotta do. - You ain't got the money.
mm, the man saying it's nearly $2, 000 in work to get it back right.
so go to Larry.
I mean, he gonna do the right thing on this.
Nah, I can't ask him for it when it's my family's crypt.
he don't care.
he got the money and you in need.
I don't want it to be like that.
I start leaning on his money,
soon enough he gonna be talking about
there ain't no reason for me to keep this bar going here.
so how much you got?
on hand, after I pay the liquor man, $1100, $1100.
$150 right there.
Antoine, that nonsense last week between you and me
that was a Mardi Gras fuck, that's all.
that ain't got nothing to do with it. - I'm just saying.
we in lent now. The legs are closed.
just pick up the money, Ladonna. Stop talking shit.
you need to bury your damn brother.
thank you, Antoine.
we family.
we're kind of closed right now, son,
unless you want something to go.
no, nothing for me. I'm here for you, ma'am.
gonna fix your roof.
Hey, Davis. - Hey.
how are ya? - I'm well and I'll be a lot better
if you journey to my treme estate for a soiree.
and, uh, bring the -- bring your fiddle
because all kind of folk are sitting in.
I got a gig on Frenchmen street this evening.
come after.
well, bring him if you want.
or not.
sneak off in the night.
look, it's got the address. Stuff it in a pocket.
party or not, you're always welcome here.
but I gave my money to Riley
and the court's gonna say that lying motherfucker
is the one who gotta fix my roof.
Yes, ma'am, he got behind the eight ball, but Riley's a good man.
he just messed up the cash flow some.
I paid Riley.
I ain't giving no more money to you or anybody else.
no need. I got enough saved to cover materials
and the job will on take me two days.
you got my word. - So let me understand this.
you done waltzed in here and tell this lady
that you don't need no money to fix her roof
and that if she say so, you'll fix it in...
two days.
I'm from the state of Texas, ma'am.
no disrespect, but you all got a defective work ethic down here.
excuse me.
Hey, baby.
you look great.
Oh my God.
Where's -- ah, you're here?
gents, tink tink.
Hi, baby.
ladies and gentlemen,
this is a party in the treme,
which means we will not be using the stereo.
professor, if you will.
all right. - Yeah, come on.
duck and andouille, corn cakes. What's missing, Lou?
pepper jelly. - Key.
Miguel, grab the jelly from the stove.
okay. - Maxine, order for Maxine.
looks lovely, Janette. - Wait. Last touch, darlin'.
can't do without that.
I miss your restaurant. - Aw, enjoy.
okay, I gotta get started on more pork chops.
everybody's favorite, huh?
you all right working the register and taking orders?
I'm going to work, boss.
who's a guy gotta know to get some service around here?
Hey, you're rude to the staff,
you'll be waiting a long time, pal.
what did he say?
uh, he says he can smell something
Lluvia, whatever that is.
Hey, you better not slow down.
Kermit's in there waiting on you, man.
save me a sausage, will you?
I'll have my girl run it into you, Antoine.
good lookin' out.
that is not on my latest C. D.
which is nonetheless available at the door.
so take one and leave a token of your appreciation in the jar if the spirit?
can you guys do Irma Thomas?
can I do Irma? - "I wish someone would care," please.
I can play the piano part, but I can't be Irma.
uh, I can.
what? For real?
trust me, honey, she can sing.
she cook too? - Let her buck.
can I get it in "d"? - You got it, baby.
all right!
Ellie! Order for Ellie.
shortcake. - Hi.
Oh, back for seconds, are ya?
already had that. I'm here for dessert.
two catfish.
you got another gumbo order. - Okay, gumbo.
Magnie! Magnie in the house!
you didn't tell me you had magnie up in here.
now I'm embarrassed. - Don't be, darlin'. You were great.
thanks for coming, baby.
here you go, mark.
what do you think?
the weatherman didn't call for it.
thank you. We're gonna take a little break.
I ain't gonna get electrocuted for my art.
it'll blow over, right?
all right, all right, ladies and gentlemen.
we're safe and warm in here... -Yeah, you right.
...so let's have some fun!
save the beer!
come on, inside we go. Good job.
I'm gonna go home. I'll see you all later. - Get that stuff inside.
gonna grab my purse. I'll meet you at the bar.
fuck me. Fuck me!
wonderful party. - Thanks, man.
no? - Mm.
careful.
you're all right, Davis.
I have to admit something.
no no no no.
I need to say this.
I have a confession to make.
I did call the police that time last summer
when you were rehearsing the brass band on the first floor.
that was me. - Dude, don't worry on it.
you called the cops for loud music in the treme?
bygones bygones.
I didn't know he did it.
I had nothing whatsoever to do with that.
any other secrets you'd like to unburden yourself of?
don, lighten up!
it's bygones. - Come on, baby.
no fighting, no fighting.
God, Allan, I cannot believe you would just lie to me like that.
I don't know who I'm living with anymore.
it's a vale of tea.
Henry.
Hey, darlin'. Where you been at?
party's spent.
a good one though while it lasted.
party? Is Davis still up?
still up,
still crazy.
I just knew something was gonna come through for me tonight.
something?
someone.
you had a pay, Davis?
you didn't invite me.
well, you had your gig at bacchanal
and I didn't -- I didn't want you to be upset.
Yeah, my gig at bacchanal...
what's wrong?
you have class today?
freshman lit, my calling.
I thought that was an 11: 00.
I'm not leaving yet.
I have some things in the office I need to do before I go.
dad could drop me off at school later.
it's not like we're doing anything important in first period anyway.
none of its important according to you.
you're coming with me. - Dad.
better listen to your mom.
you all right, Cray?
well, once more into the brief.
Hey, Sofia!
sweetie, daddy.
I -- I just... - What?
I just wanted to tell you you look very pretty today.
really nice.
Thanks, daddy.
enjoy your day. - I will.
Hey, Toni. - Huh?
kick a little ass today.
you buckled up?
morning.
I'm sorry about your night.
I'm glad you ended it here though.
no, don't be.
the thunderstorm cleared things up for me.
there'll be other opportunities.
I know that, but not here.
Ugh, not that again.
you can't -- you can't be serious. - Mm, I am.
you're a damn good chef.
I am better than good, but this town beat me.
as much as I love it, I'm not trying to fight with it anymore.
but New York?
I wanna see how I stack up
against the big boys, you know?
without all these -- these broke-ass levees - And blocked gas lines and-- - Hey.
may I quote the author of "la cuisine creole"?
I believe it's your professional bible.
Jesus, Davis, do you ever stop?
new York is very fashionable and fast,
so fast you can't even stroll through it.
you just get pushed along.
and don't plan on getting invited to any backyard barbecues - Because there ain't no backyards. - You don't know that.
everyone dressed in business suits,
working working working.
of course the, uh -- what do you call it?
the financials are very strong. - Davis
would you rather have a strong economy or a four-hour lunch?
would you rather have a Macy's day parade with fucking Bullwinkle floats
or an impromptu second line
where you dance your ass off with your neighbors?
is your check from the tourism board in the mail?
there are so many...
beautiful moments here.
they're just moments.
they're not a life.
you about to sit there all day?
what else I'm gonna do?
well, we could use a little help.
see if you can do better on a job than the last time.
what's the job?
I got a rack of supplies I gotta pick up at home depot,
store here in the bar -- gypsum and alum.
what's that? - Raw materials for plaster.
boy, you wanna make some coin or what? - I ain't seen nothing yet,
after all that work I did helping him with that suit.
you do my lifting for me, you'll get a little something today.
all right.
shit, I don't know which one of you two I feel more sorry for.
she was blindly following whatever impulse moved her
as if she had placed herself in alien hands for direction and freed her soul of responsibility.
okay, Ben?
I'm just trying to put this book into perspective.
is "the awakening" the first women's lib novel or something?
I wouldn't-- no, to label it as such
would be to ghettoize a great work.
well, what happens to Edna was
I thought it was really depressing.
no no.
this isn't a feminist manifesto.
this book is not about Edna's emancipation from male authority
and the ending of the book is not the end.
it is a transition,
a rejection of disappointment and failure.
the farther Edna walks away
from the constraints of society and convention,
the more free she becomes.
she's not moving toward the darkness.
she's embracing spiritual liberation.
I'm gonna let you all go early today.
all right! - Go out and read. It's a glorious day.
thank God.
it's called "work." Get used to it.
your back's gonna hurt for the next 40, 50 years.
Hey, I should at least get a beer at the end of the day?
we got one more stop to make. Let's go.
what's it gonna be then, boss?
a bowl of gumbo, barbecue shrimp Po' boy
and another Abita Amber.
that's what I like to hear.
nothing like Liuzza's, huh?
some say this one's better than the other one on Bienville.
the pope in Avignon.
those army dudes?
just back from active duty in Iraq.
I heard a rumor they were down here now.
wanted to see it for myself.
so? You ain't changed nothing doing what you did.
lost a battle is all.
but sometimes the battles worth fighting
are the ones you know you're gonna lose.
those cops, they know who you are.
you see the way they keep looking at you?
but you could get locked up again.
they gonna do what they gonna do.
me, I'm gonna be heard.
so that's why you wanna mask?
I love me some fess,
but it don't go so easily with violin.
Jambalaya. I'll do gate mouth.
one, two.
so happy to see you.
$100 more
from last night's gig, for Daymo.
who the fuck is you?
you can pay me back when you can.
I called Larry last night.
he wiring the rest of the money today.
Oh. Well, that's good.
I know him glad he could help.
you not gonna open up today?
why bother with all that noise?
tell you what -- that boy's a workhorse though.
shouldn't be all that much longer before he's done.
you know, it's all gonna work out,
you'll see.
are you sure?
always for pleasure, dear.
can I burn one of those from you?
they're reds. - All the better.
don't ever let anyone tell you to quit.
these are wonderful.
obliged.
where are you headed?
my place.
Where's that?
you want me to walk with you?
I'll be okay. It's just a couple of blocks.
I hope we, uh, play together again.
night.
what exactly is a dependent clause?
you're asking the wrong person.
that's your father's department.
but I need to turn this in tomorrow.
where is he?
I tried to call. He's not answering his cell.
probably just out of juice.
you know how he forgets to charge it.
good morning, Mr. Basset. This is your wake-up call.
please move your ass.
stampede!
stampede, Earl! Get out of the way!
you dumb shit.
I was in a stampede once.
300 head going hell-bent for the horizon.
exactly how many cows are required for a stampede, Earl?
I mean, is it like three or more? Is there a minimum speed?
I wish a stampede up your ass.
no breakfast?
I did it yesterday. It was bologna and beans.
no. It was eggs. I did eggs...
...over easy.
the hell you did. Bologna and beans. It's your turn.
I guess when I'm your age...
...l'll forget what I eat, too.
goddamn it!
I ask you, is this a job for intelligent men?
show me one. I'll ask him.
if we were serious about money, we'd quit being hired hands.
handymen, Earl. We are handymen.
we should quit this job...
...and find ourselves some real employment.
are you going to give up all this personal freedom?
I don't know.
freeway!
what's on the agenda for today?
it's garbage day. - Man! Already?
what's Nestor paying us?
$50. And that's $47 more than we got.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their linoleum today...
...and the garbage tomorrow.
Nestor's not home tomorrow. We don't dig today, we're not paid.
damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.
you never take the long view. Here it is Monday...
...and I'm already thinking of Wednesday.
it is Monday, right?
who the hell's that? That's not the grad student?
no. He graduated. Must be the new one. - The new one?
that's supposed to be a girl.
you will have long, blonde hair...
...big green eyes, world-class breasts...
...ass that won't quit and legs that go all the way up!
Hi! I'm Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester.
Yeah, geography. - Geology.
well, actually seismology. Earthquakes.
you two must be Val and Earl.
I've heard all about you. - We deny everything.
I've got a question for you.
do you know if anybody's doing any drilling or blasting...
...or anything like that?
around here? No, ma'am.
I'm supposed to monitor the seismographs.
you know, they measure vibrations.
vibrations in the ground.
Yeah.
I've been getting some really strange readings.
the school's had the machines here, and we've never recorded anything like this.
we'll ask around. See if anyone's heard anything.
Thanks.
God, I hope they're not broken. I might have to bag the whole semester.
anyway, sorry to bother you.
no problem.
nice meeting you. Hope you get it all sorted out.
if you wanted, we could take a look at those...
...seismographs for her if you want.
what the hell do we know about seismographs?
nothing.
it might be a slick way to get to know her. - Why?
damn it, Valentine.
you don't go for any gal unless she fits your list, top to bottom.
well sure! - It's dumber than my hind end.
I mean, like that...
...Bobby Lynn Dexter.
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
it don't matter. They're all the same: dead weight.
Oh, I broke a nail!
makes my skin crawl.
I'm a victim of circumstance.
I thought you call it your pecker.
Pizza-face!
Melvin.
you touch that truck and die.
man, I'm really shaking.
Thanks, Walter.
these are hollow points, but not hydro-shock hollow points.
bullets are bullets. - Hi, guys. What's happening?
we ran into that new college student, that Rona.
Rhonda. She's having trouble with her...
...things.
those college kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...
...next thing the Feds will be at our door. "Sorry. Time to move. Eminent domain.
down, honey. Down.
Yeah, Burt. The way you worry...
...you'll get a heart attack before you get a chance to survive World War III.
we'll see.
guys, listen. Bearing going out. What do you think?
could be. - Later, Chang. We got a schedule to keep.
Yeah. See, we plan ahead. That way we don't do anything right now.
Earl explained it to me.
cocktail?
you bet.
I'll tell you.
nobody handles garbage better than we do.
come on, Earl. This is low.
we have got to set our sights a little bit higher.
Melvin, why don't you give us a hand? Most of this shit is yours anyway.
listen, run to the store and pick me up a six-pack. I'll pay for it.
son, beer is for adults.
not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this.
just doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.
are you going to stand there and tell me I'm the reason we're still in Perfection?
you know how close I am to leaving this place right now?
I'll call that little bluff. How close?
shit! - Goddamn!
Jesus Christ! Goddamn!
don't forget the TV.
why you bringing the vacuum cleaner? - I like it.
you never use it. - It's good for parts.
besides, maybe we'll hire a maid. You think about that?
get in the truck.
guys!
guys, wait!
sorry, Nancy. We're not delivering firewood anymore.
we're heading for Bixby permanent. - Sure.
Oh, my God. You really are!
Mindy, what's the count?
I don't need firewood. I have this big order to fill and have to build my pottery kiln.
come on, it'll be at least a month's work.
I'll throw in lunches.
and beer.
I can't believe we said no to free beer.
we did it! We faced temptation and did not bend!
Goddamn! Praise the Lord!
now there's nothing, and I mean nothing, between us and Bixby.
look at that guy!
that's one job I'd never do. Working around electricity.
hold up.
that's Edgar Deems.
come on.
he only wears that one damn jacket.
that's him, I'm telling you.
he sure must've been drunk this time.
get your butt down from there!
shit.
we can't leave him up there.
thank you, Edgar.
you owe me on this one, you damned old boozehound.
one of these days, you'll have to get your ass on a wagon and stay there.
it's not like I don't have better things to do than climb towers...
...and drag your hairy ass down.
Jesus!
was it a heart attack, doctor?
no.
he died of dehydration. Thirst.
that doesn't make any sense. That takes a couple of days, doesn't it?
maybe even three or four.
you mean he sat up there three or four days?
he sat up there and just died of thirst?
you reckon he hated Perfection more than us?
do you suppose he wanted to kill himself? - Somebody must've chased him up there.
you mean someone that ain't scared of a Winchester rifle?
then what'd they do? Camp out and wait for him to die?
what the hell?
what the shit?
Fred!
this is weird. - This is real weird.
Jesus! - What the hell's going on?
I mean, what the hell is going on?
get the hell out of here! There's a killer on the loose!
what? - A murderer, man! A real psycho!
he's cutting people's heads off. I'm not kidding!
they're pulling our chain.
Yeah.
what?
Howard!
Carmine?
who could be doing it?
I'm not accusing anybody, but some of my cattle are missing.
are you serious? Old Fred's dead?
you're bullshitting me. - What happened to Fred?
what happened to him? - You won't believe it.
I need a candy bar. - I don't believe this. The phone's dead.
Walter, your phone is dead! - I didn't do it.
nestor, what's happening?
somebody killed old Fred. - What's going on?
Val, you've got to get to Bixby, and get the police up here. And step on it.
consider it stepped on.
we decided to leave this place one damn day too late, you know?
there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.
everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
look out!
is there some higher force at work here?
I mean, are we asking too much of life?
where the hell are these guys?
what are they doing? Blasting?
where are you guys? It's not like there's another road, assholes!
Jesus! I don't believe this! - You're hung up.
I am not!
you're hung up, I tell you!
you're going to burn the clutch!
you could break an axle like that. - Could you shut up?
I don't need to spend the night out here.
crybaby.
could it have been coyotes? - No way.
coyotes didn't kill Fred.
it's Val and Earl.
they shouldn't be here already.
thought you two were in Bixby by now. - You're won't believe this.
mom! - Oh, my God!
Burt, be careful. - Unreal.
Where'd you get it? - I didn't know we had it.
it's disgusting. - Some kind of snake?
it's more like an eel to me. - Eels live in the water, don't they?
big mother slug, maybe. - Don't touch!
relax. It's dead.
it must've grabbed us!
that's why the truck stalled. - I said I wasn't hung up.
this stalled out your truck?
it'd have to be one strong son of a bitch.
stinks, too.
I'll give you boys $5 for this.
20
okay, $10! - $15.
okay, $15. - Damn right, $15.
I don't believe you guys.
could be a snake!
some kind of mutation.
whatever it is...
...just one of these couldn't eat up Fred and his whole flock of sheep.
you think there are more out there?
I'm dead. Let's put this stuff up in the morning.
we have to go to Bixby in the morning.
the cinder blocks are in. - The cinder blocks. Oh, my God!
just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
that's the sky that'll be over our roof every night when we're done.
what if we don't finish the roof? Then we can look at the sky all the time.
that damn thing.
maybe it's time we buy a new generator.
it's gone!
what do you mean, it's gone?
you sure this is where it was?
it was right here! There's the cord. Hold this.
maybe the ground caved in. There's mines and stuff around here.
well, don't then. You don't want to fall in.
let's go.
God, what is that stink?
you hear that?
come on. Let's just go.
let's go back to town or something. Please, Jim!
maybe it's a geological thing like natural gas...
...or a geyser. They stink like that. Remember in Yellowstone?
something's got me!
something's got me down here!
get something. Get me out of here!
something's got me. Please get me out!
help me!
Oh, my God.
don't look so afraid. It won't hurt you. - Mindy look up. Smile.
hold it.
Melvin, get out of there!
old Chang, slick as snot, and I ain't lying. - A lousy $15.
a man who plans ahead.
we arm ourselves, we set perimeters, we stand guard.
any of those snake things show up here, we make 'em extinct.
all right! - Burt, get serious.
Yeah! You make it sound like a war.
what've you got against being prepared?
Rambo.
Walter's got a CB radio. Why aren't you calling Bixby? The police...
we can't reach outside the valley because of the mountains.
you're next. Sit down, look scared.
the phone's out. The road's out. We're on our own.
you two are just loving it, aren't you?
Nancy, don't get personal about this! We've got to do something.
hell, yes!
we are completely cut off.
we got the cliffs to the north, mountains to the east and the west.
that's why Heather and me settled here. Geographic isolation.
there's got to be a way we can get help. - This isn't the moon!
what are you going to do, walk the 38 miles to Bixby?
there's Walter's saddle horses.
that's it. You're welcome to them.
somebody could ride to Bixby.
that's not bad.
who's best on a horse?
they better be fast.
we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.
those snakes couldn't travel that fast. - For all you know they could fly.
what do you want? This Colt or Edgar's old rifle?
rifle.
here's some Swiss cheese and bullets. - Thanks.
you guys all set? - Ready as we'll ever be.
we're going to find that college girl, tell her to get her ass back into town.
good idea. We'll stop by the doctor's place and see if they went into Bixby.
wait a minute, guys.
take something that packs more of a punch than that. 30-. 30.
why don't you take one of our Browning autos?
or better than that. Take my Model 70?
it's. 375 "H and H" mag.
Thanks, Heather.
I hope we don't need to use it.
it's got me!
it's got me!
grow up! - Damn it!
he's only kidding. - You came that close.
too close. No more games.
one of these days somebody's going to kick your ass.
doctor?
I hate this shit.
wait a minute.
the car's gone. We just missed 'em, that's all.
Where's the goddamn golden oldie coming from?
what the hell's this? - You got me.
here's the plan. We don't even stop. We ride like hell.
tonight we'll keep right on going. We'll walk the horses.
that is the plan. What the hell are those things?
how could they bury a station wagon? - Why would they do it?
come on, git!
Walter wouldn't know a decent horse if it bit him in the ass.
wait a minute. They got wind of something they don't like.
something's going on.
I don't see anything anywhere!
are you okay? - Yeah. What about my horse?
what in the name of...
that's how they get you. They're under the goddamn ground.
what the hell are they? - Sons of bitches!
must be a million of 'em!
Nope. Just one.
come on.
he's gaining on us!
look!
we can make it!
stupid son of a bitch.
it knocked itself cold.
cold, my ass!
he's dead.
we killed it.
we killed it!
fuck you!
Hey, guys. What's going on?
did you notice anything weird a minute ago?
I mean, it just happened...
what's that?
all right, together. One, two, three.
Jesus Christ!
does it smell like that 'cause it's dead?
I don't see any eyes.
must be totally subterranean.
and those tentacles.
you know, I think they shoot right out of its mouth...
...and they hook you and pull you right in.
good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
this is important, you know.
this is like...
...well, let's just say it.
this is probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.
check this out.
I found the ass end.
Jesus, we really caught something here.
Wow! - Man!
that's one big mother.
this must be the old boy had your seismos working overtime.
it must push itself along with these.
all of them pushing at once.
that's why it moved so fast.
this thing had sensors tripping all over the place. No...
Rhonda, you ever heard of anything like this?
everybody knows about 'em. We just didn't tell you.
hell, man, no one ever saw anything like this!
we're really onto something.
I'll tell you, old Chang don't get his slick mitts on this for no measly $15.
you got that right.
all right, here's the plan. We need a flatbed...
right, with a winch. - A five-ton maybe.
no, don't want a winch. It'd tear it all up.
a crane? - Yeah, a crane with lifting straps.
shut up.
there are three more of these things. - What?
three more?
I've got seismographs all over the valley. Compare the readings.
here's one at 2: 00 yesterday.
but here's one three miles away at the exact time. That's two.
but here... - We'll take your word.
Yeah, where's your truck? - Just beyond that hill.
what?
damn prairie dog burrow. - Little sons of bitches.
this way!
up on that rock!
looks like the one that got our truck.
where the hell's your truck? - Right over there.
I don't think we can make that.
live ones smell worse than the dead ones.
I got it.
they're mutations caused by radiation.
or no.
the government built 'em. Big surprise for the Russians.
there's nothing like them in the fossil record. I'm sure.
okay, so, they predate the fossil record.
that would make 'em a couple billion years old.
and we've just never seen one 'til now.
right.
I vote for outer space. No way these are local boys.
well, haven't seen a sign for hours.
must be long gone.
Yeah, must be.
why don't you take a little stroll and find out?
we've got to do something.
we've got to do something.
I don't know why "we" always has to be "me" every damn time.
we, we, we. What do I look like? An expert on worms?
watch it, it's got a good six-foot reach.
thank you, Earl.
son of a bitch!
son of a goddamn bitch! Pardon my French.
shit! It's been waiting here all this time? How's it know we're still here?
it's got no eyes, right? Sure as hell can't smell us underground.
it's been listening.
of course!
it senses seismic vibration.
it can hear every move we make on this rock. It's a perfect conductor!
that means we're stuck. That pisses me off!
I hate to be crude, but I've got to take care of business.
me, too. - Same here.
Thanks.
no problem. Anytime.
well, what's the plan?
the first thing we've got to do is see if old Stumpy's still out there.
can I borrow that shovel? - Yeah.
doesn't he have a home to go to?
that's why Edgar never got down off that damn tower.
I have an idea.
you know, we have to come up with a plan or he's going to wait us to death.
I was thinking... - Why not run? We outran him yesterday.
run for it? Running's not a plan. Running's what you do when a plan fails.
you're not trying to think of a plan.
it ain't like we got a hell of a lot of options.
there's always options. We've just got to think of them.
why don't you start thinking?
why do I always have to do all the thinking?
who died and made you Einstein? - You know how to pole vault?
we just stay where he can't get us...
...on these residual boulders. My truck's parked next to one.
stay on those residual boulders!
that Tammy Lynn Baxter, she do much pole vaulting?
that's pretty good.
that slimebag won't give us much time once we hit that truck.
I say we all jump together. - Right.
wait.
okay, ready.
one, two, three!
go!
watch it, Val!
move!
can somebody, perhaps, help me?
No!
the snake things are just their tongues. These animals are huge!
I'm sorry. I'm having a real difficult time with this.
come on, you guys, answer.
Where's Burt and Heather? - I can't reach them.
I guess they're still driving around.
what's the name you call those things?
where do they come from?
I don't know. - You're a scientist, aren't you?
aren't you supposed to have a theory?
these creatures are absolutely unprecedented.
but where do they come from?
Yeah!
it doesn't matter where they come from.
no name.
we discovered them, we should name them!
forget the damn name!
now me and Earl need to get out of this valley.
hang on. Let's not go off half-cocked.
somebody's bound to come check on us once they see the road is out...
...and the lines are down. - That's how it works.
Suckoids. - "Oids." I like "snakeoids.
one of them comes near me and I'll hit him with a five-pound pickax.
you don't understand. They come up from the ground and grab you.
they sense the slightest vibration through the ground.
even footsteps. That's how they hunt.
so we don't vibrate, right?
maybe they won't even come through here.
maybe they'll leave us alone!
chain saw. That's what I'll use.
wake up!
now, look!
they're headed right for us!
they trapped Edgar here. Grabbed old Fred right here.
nailed those two poor suckers on the road and the doctor's place is here!
this valley is just one long smorgasbord.
we have got to get out.
I'm going to get Mindy.
she's okay. I saw her playing down the street.
that's what I like, "Graboids"! That's it, "graboids"!
Jesus, Walter.
we're going to be sorry if we don't give it a name.
okay, you say let's get out of here. Where are we supposed to go?
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene alluvials.
the dirt. The loose soil that covers the valley floor.
but they can't move through rock.
we should go west to the mountains. - She means up the old Jeep trail.
if those mountains are granite we'd be safe.
we could hike along them to Bixby if we...
I scared you, didn't I?
you little ass wipe.
you don't knock it off, you're going to be shitting this basketball.
pardon my French.
it's going to take us days to get back with help with Nestor.
we're not going to leave you alone.
damn it! I'm going to kick his ass! - I'm going to help you.
where is that little shit stain?
Melvin, get your...
get inside!
run! Come on! - Come on, get in!
Walter, you got a gun? - No!
what are we going to do? - Be quiet!
where is he?
now remember, no noise, no vibrations.
no, Mindy.
stop.
Mindy, get off the pogo stick.
get her, Val! - Mindy, come back!
be quiet. Don't move.
Mindy, get back.
run! Get in the house!
get him off or it'll suck that truck down.
go back, for Chrissake!
Jesus, here comes another one!
run! Come on!
we need to talk.
where do you want to do this?
tell me! Tell me what you know!
bad news. He's dead.
he was just sitting there and said...
libens, volens, potens!
come on, Charlotte.
it's Pete, isn't it?
I'm Rosalind. I'm new.
pleasure and a privilege.
could you tell me where Lord Gaudain's room is?
well, we're not supposed to give out students' room numbers.
Mm...
front quad, staircase two. Room 15.
you've been ever so helpful.
knight to king bishop's four.
good move! Rook to H7. Check!
you blighter! You absolute bloody blighter!
isn't this place amazing?
Yeah. Unbelievable.
how's my most dashing cousin?
all the better for the sight of you, coz.
how's Uncle Harry?
making a fuss about the estate.
and Auntie Bea?
on a beach in Buenos Aires.
it was your Dad's favourite Bible.
I thought, now you're here, it'd be like he was here with you. Thanks, Mum.
I suppose I'll be off, then.
it's been two weeks, Charlotte.
you won't talk about Dad. I haven't seen you cry.
I'm dealing with it my own way.
you can't understand how Trinity changed Dad.
what it did to him.
this is a wicked place, Charlotte. You can't say that.
Oh, those two are married, are they? People did it at school too, Mum.
I've saved myself till now.
dad would be happy to hear that.
I'd best be going.
be careful, won't you?
mum...
why did Dad leave Trinity? I'll pray for you, Charlotte.
Ah, here you are.
dr Maltravers. How's Galahad?
not good.
we need a new hourglass, or I think we might be in trouble, Edmund.
have you got a printout from his readings?
give me your pencil.
what are you doing? Don't want our superiors getting jittery, do we?
now I've got to go and oversee the arrival of this year's little shits, not least among them the daughter of the late lamented Richard Arc.
great!
Hey!
what? I'm still loaded here.
so? So finish me off.
don't be sick! I'm your cousin!
hello. Where did you spring from?
Theo. I'm from Lewisham.
Oh! My uncle owns Lewisham!
your uncle owns Lewisham? I'm Rosalind.
Hi.
so, what do you think of this place?
well, I wasn't too impressed to start with but...things are looking up.
I'm way out of your league.
are you sure? You see, my uncle, he owns a garden centre.
there's a party tonight. The Feast of Fools.
is that an invite? No.
it's quite hard to get into.
Yeah, well, I'm good at getting into things.
pleased to hear it.
maybe see you later, then.
Yeah, maybe.
Hi. I'm Charlotte Arc.
we're neighbours!
nice to meet you. Yeah.
erm, I've invited a few people for tea and biscuits in my room.
thought you might like to come along.
Yeah. Why not?
you're Theo Mackenzie, aren't you? Yeah.
I came top in three of my four A-levels.
I just had to find out who beat me in the fourth. Right.
I am a Christian, yes.
we're Christians.
OK, the thing I'm dying to ask...
biology A-level, paper 2. Question 13.
yeah? What did you put?
Hey, I hear there's a party tonight.
I doubt it. You do know that Trinity doesn't have a Freshers' week?
they expect us to study. To study.
so there's no parties.
well, unless you mean the Feast of Fools?
the Dandelion Club party.
upper-class twits.
doubtless all the girls will end up taking their clothes off and offering themselves to the first available guy...
right.
just out of interest, how would I...or anyone else...
get to this party?
you're not thinking of going, are you?
Hey, look, you could come with me!
I really don't think so.
I saw her first. Hands off.
well, this has been...
the biscuits were amazing.
really good biscuits.
I guess I'll see you...around.
age shall not wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety.
thank you, Edmund.
this is it, then.
I'm very proud of you, you know.
you're going to do wonderfully here.
I hope so.
thank you for everything. My pleasure...
warden.
20 years ago, a young graduate knocked at my door to interview for doctorate.
slip of a thing, she was.
short hair. Rather reminiscent of an eight-year-old boy.
she stands before you now, as diminutive as ever, but with a string of academic posts and several books behind her.
gentlemen, Marjorie, this is an ambitious woman.
a forward-thinking woman, a woman I know who clearly relishes the challenge of dragging our weary old institution into the so-called modern world.
I give you your new Warden, Dr Angela Donne.
welcome back to Bridgeford.
almost dropped it then!
I'll go. Oh, bugger, it's the wrong box.
it's the wrong box!
all my old toys, they were meant to be going to Africa!
this was meant to be full of clothes!
Oh, my God. What were you thinking, Maddy?! You idiot!
Maddy, right? Yeah.
don't you think the people in Africa will probably prefer the clothes?
Yeah. Yeah, they will, won't they!
I mean what were they going to do with a blinking My Little Pony?
eat it?!
on the other hand, they are quite hungry, aren't they?
the Africans.
Yeah. Really old ones.
I guess I'll be seeing you around, then, yeah?
sorry, what's your name? Theo.
thank you. Bye.
fit!
I'm ready for my bedder now, thank you, Mr Dobkin.
Where's Ingrid?
Oh, this is ridiculous!
Oh, excuse me. I was...
I can't get the key to er...
damn.
Where's my bedder? She should be in your room.
that ogre?! I usually have a Swedish bedder. Where is she?
I imagine she's back in Gothenburg, recovering from the abortion that we paid for.
bingo.
maybe this term...you could keep your sperm in the bag?
I'd be ever so grateful.
I want a new bedder. Now.
not possible. Auburn hair please, since it's Michaelmas!
I always find redheads very Christmassy, don't you?
Dorian, you should know there have been some changes round here.
we have a new Warden.
a modernist, who leans more than somewhat to the left.
so get rid of him. It's a her, actually.
a woman Warden?
does Daddy know about this?
see yous later! See yous later!
I like your Vans. I like yours.
awesome. Thanks.
do you like Donnie Darko?
the film movie? Aye.
do you want to come to my room and get mashed? -Oh, aye, like!
awesome!
I've taught at Bridgeford University for over 30 years.
the Seventies were the worst.
hippies and lesbians pounding at the gates, demanding change.
this is the 20th century,' they would say.
do you know what you'd do in that situation? Nothing.
young tick.
you give them something - something you can bear and they can call a victory.
back then, we let women in. Masterstroke!
so when the Education Minister came to me last May and said 'this is 21st century,' I knew what had to be done.
this Warden's a publicity stunt?
well, she...
she was one of my PhD students.
hard-working. Pretty.
ish. An idealist.
the kind of fluff they like to see. Well, stiff upper lip.
at least I have a party to look forward to. Yes, that reminds me...
you are NOT touching the Feast of Fools! -Not me. Her.
she can't! It's important to college morale!
picking two students from lower-class families to be your jesters for the year? Yes. What's the problem?
Dorian, it's not...
.politic.
honestly, what is happening to this place?
now look... Who's that?
Theo Mackenzie. I interviewed him.
surprisingly promising.
this is the finest academic institution in the country.
I go away for one summer, and you've turned it into a basketball team.
I'm going back to bed. Dorian...
there's a girl on your corridor. Charlotte Arc.
I want you to keep an eye on her?
is she pretty? She's a Christian.
hmm. Challenge.
why, out of interest? Do you think she's a troublemaker?
I knew her father.
So...give me three guesses.
missing your parents?
Hey, hey...
my dad died recently.
I am so terribly sorry.
where was his estate? You are landed, aren't you?
if you count a terraced house in Leeds as landed.
my mistake. I presumed you were of good breeding.
after all, you're so frightfully pretty. Those cheekbones.
like Eleanor of Aquitaine.
why don't you have two tickets for a little party I'm having tonight.
a lovely thing like you would fit right in.
lunch soon! Shower for me.
yes?
I was just wanted to say that what you said back there about breeding and me being pretty. Well, I think...
look, I believe in meritocracy, OK?
so breeding doesn't mean you're pretty, and even if it did...that was wrong!
Hey, I'm sorry.
is that all?
erm... Yes, thank you.
very well, then.
dr Cooper. Unusual to see you here.
that's just what I was going to say. He's so rarely out of his lab these days.
he takes his work seriously, don't you, Linus?
the light came on. Midnight.
Mm. Is there a problem?
I'm not sure I'm going to have enough time.
of course you will. Of course you will.
did you get taller? Probably just...
.standing up straighter. You haven't changed.
no? No, not at all.
except your hair's longer, obviously.
a few less freckles dappling your nose.
I have to apologise. I was supposed to come to your introductory speech.
and I wanted to come but I didn't.
and then I sat there at my desk and I thought this is silly.
I have to clear the air sooner or later, so I'm sorry for what I said last time we met.
it was 20 years ago.
you remember. I told you I loved you.
good Luck. Thank you.
Yes, well, I just want you to know...
a lot's changed here. A lot. I've changed.
Lloyd. Get into line. Sorry.
maybe we could have a coffee sometime. Catch up.
so question 41, Angus Fergus...
what are your major ambitions here at Trinity?
I suppose, if I were honest, Raj Puri...
.my major ambition would be to...
.lose my virginity. Snap.
I mean, at school, I had a lot of offers
a great number of offers, but...
I just didn't seem to get round to it.
snap, man. I mean, me too, you know. It's just like...
sex is like, so manic, isn't it?
it's like you get one chance and you have to, like, grab it then and there.
you know? Like, honestly, it's not chilled. It's not cool.
sex is uncool. It is way uncool.
snap, man.
still, I...I guess we should have some.
Aye. Yeah.
Aye.
Yeah.
this lunch thing's soon, isn't it?
fear not my friend.
if there's one defining characteristic of Raj Puri - me,
it's that I NEVER lose track of time.
welcome to Trinity, Charlotte.
is that an engagement ring?
Gethin - that's my boyfriend.
he said there'd probably be loads of chances for me to have meaningless sex at university, and he didn't want me doing that.
so we...we got engaged.
that's a bit casual, isn't it?
Yeah! It's just a light-hearted engagement, really.
it's not like we're going to and get married or anything.
further out, sir. Oh, yeah, thanks.
further still.
right, thanks.
and that's the lady's glass. Sorry.
and you're not supposed to drink before grace.
Cheers, mate.
what is their problem? They are picky.
but if you read the Freshers' brochure, it's...
stand for grace!
alpha row, could you begin, please?
nos et haec tua dona...
don't tell me you didn't learn the grace!
OK, let's be clear here. I didn't read the stupid Freshers' leaflet.
I didn't know this was going to be so...
Oh, shit. He doesn't know it.
Participes faciat nos. One more time.
Parsnips...satcha...toast?
sorry. Yeah, sorry about that.
go on, say something, please.
Rex aeternae gloriae!
watch it! Sorry. Sorry, mate.
Hey, you're in that Marigold Club.
dandelion Club.
Yeah, that's the one. I'm its President.
Oh, nice one. Hey, I hear you're having a party tonight.
that's right.
Finally! Thank God! Someone round here doing something normal.
listen, mate, I was thinking I could come along.
you have to be a member of the Dandelion Club if you want to come to the party.
it's something of a commitment. Well, I'm a committed kind of bloke.
good. Good. OK. Well...
we are a student society wholly devoted to the pursuit of pleasure.
when you're a Dandelion, you're not expected to work.
you are, however, expected to drink an awful lot and have sex with the most beautiful women.
are you the kind of guy who could handle that? Yeah, I reckon so.
so how do I join?
you can't, because your parents are poor.
I'm Dorian, President of the Dandelion Club.
if it's about the Feast of Fools, I'm sorry but there's no arguing the matter.
it's a college tradition. Perhaps you're not aware.
I was here 20 years ago. I remember the Dandelion club.
Dorian, not troubling the Warden, are you?
I was just explaining my decision to cancel the Feast of Fools.
quite right. The college has to move with the times. Does it?
forcing two students to be your jesters for the year against their will?
my dear boy, it smacks of slavery. Quite.
so, Dorian, shall we let that be the last word?
of course, if a couple of students were to volunteer, then...
who would volunteer? I admit it's unlikely.
but, purely hypothetically, if they did, then the college would have to respect their decision.
what's your position on this matter, Warden?
well, if they were to volunteer, there'd be nothing I could do.
find your fools and get on with it. Just make sure they agree to the job.
no need to thank me. Thank you?
where on earth am I going to find two people stupid enough to agree to being my slaves?
excuse me...
is this where we meet for lunch?
cancel that last complaint.
I-I'm a first year. Charlotte Arc.
Charlotte. How can I help you?
I think you might have known my father. Oh?
I've got this photo of him from back then and you're in it.
I'm sure that's you.
well, that's certainly seems to be me.
what did you say your father's name?
Yes, he was in my doctorate group but...
we didn't know each other very well. But...
I think I look a little drunk in that picture. It's amazing the friends you make.
look, my dad left Trinity very suddenly.
I was just hoping maybe you remembered something.
Charlotte, I think this is something you should take up with your father.
I would do. I can't now.
he's dead. He's dead?
how? When?
about two weeks ago.
well, I'm...I'm sorry.
as I said, I didn't really know your father very well.
could you...
I'm really very busy.
thought we could walk down to our first tutorial together. I'm leaving.
what? Why?
well, let me see. Maybe it's the weird people.
or the strange cutlery. Or the fact I got laughed at by the entire college.
I just get the impression this place isn't really for me.
it's Trinity. Everyone finds it a bit strange.
Charlotte, this place is fucking mental! How can you be so blase?
you got into Trinity! Yeah, and five other places.
it's just a university, Charlotte. No, it's the best university!
well, not for me.
you know, you're pretty see-through.
you make out that this is all because you're so cool and normal.
but you know what's really going on? You're scared.
so what if I am! It's easy for you.
you've probably wanted to come here since you were five. You fit in.
I don't feel like I fit in. Trust me. You do.
well, my dad didn't. He was here for ten years.
he was brilliant, my mum said. And then suddenly he left.
because something happened to him here.
he'd never even talk about it, he never explained.
he was just...sad.
he was always sad...
and now he's dead.
so don't pretend that this is easier for me than you, because this place freaks me out!
and I reckon I've got better reasons than you.
right, I'm going to my tutorial now.
maybe I'll see you there. Look...
we agree to do the Dandelion Club's bidding in all things, regardless of embarrassment to ourselves or those near to us for the term of one year.'
are there going to be girls at this party?
Oh, yes.
what do we have to do again?
just be yourselves. If you could just sign it...
in your own blood.
just kidding.
red ink will do nicely.
excuse me. Can I give my key back?
this way, young sir.
something not to your liking?
seriously, mate, I just want to give my key back.
leaving us already, Theo?
five hours at Trinity.
something to tell your kids about. What?
I thought you'd last longer, that's all.
Yeah, well, no offence, but this place...
what's wrong with it? Too many people like me?
you know the first Lord Gaudain was a country squire, not that much better than a peasant.
he invented a new way of manufacturing sword handles.
great. It made him hundreds of thousands of pounds.
billions in today's money.
I don't think there's been a member of my family who hasn't been to this university since.
Yeah. Heart-warming. Make a good Christmas film.
there are two kinds of people who matter, Theo.
those who have it and those who earn it.
I have it. You have to earn it.
your bags are being delivered to your room as we speak, Miss Gaudain.
Thanks, Pete.
nice meeting you.
right. I'm Dr Maltravers.
I have been a fellow of this college for over 30 years, and my research has resulted in the development of dioxypeptisol,
the miracle cancer drug you may have read about.
miss Arc, isn't it?
is that the dioxypeptisol originally thought to be a fix for incipient glaucoma?
there were some initial problems identifying its precise benefit.
the enquiry said that official approval had been rushed through.
40 babies went blind.
funny that I should see the day that my ethics should be called into question by the daughter of Richard Arc.
this term...
sorry I'm late. Hm.
well, come in, Mr Mackenzie. Close the door, please.
as I was saying, this term, it is anatomy.
and here at Trinity's very own mortuary, you will each be dissecting your own corpse.
the first tutorial is tomorrow morning, which means one of you must work overnight in the labs preparing a presentation on the topic, 'the mechanics of the arm'.
miss Arc, you seem a keen student.
Yes. Good.
well, I look forward to your presentation tomorrow morning at 9am.
excuse me, Mr Mackenzie.
see you all then.
you're going to be up all night.
Yeah. I'm going to be slaving away here while you're living it up at the Dandelion Club Party.
what? It's not really my thing anyway.
take Maddy.
asexual mitosis.
biology A-level, question number 13. Oh! I didn't think of that.
thank you. You're welcome.
and representing the comprehensive school system, here's Maddy Talbot and Theo Mackenzie.
Oh, Theo, everybody's so clever and beautiful and posh.
shut up! You're going to be the most elegant girl at this party.
do you think? Definitely. Come on.
Y-Y-Y-Your dress, your pants. You might want to... Oh!
Ah! Peasants!
well, come in! Wipe your filthy boots!
what's in the box?
you know, Angus, this is going to be really good for us.
you think? No doubt!
see, the first step to sex is getting girls to notice you.
after tonight, every girl in college is gonna know exactly who we are.
no doubt! No doubt!
Nooooo doubt!
no doubt! Noooo doubt!
what's the matter, coz? You don't think I'm being unseemly?
listen, I'm about to make a speech.
then we could finish what we started earlier.
I don't know what you're talking about.- You left me gagging.
Aw, bless! Dorian, it was only natural we should want to do it once.
all that horseplay in the stables and games of Twister at Christmas.
who wouldn't feel a bit incestuous?
but it was just a silly act of rebellion. I'm over it now.
it was just this morning! I'm over it now!
if I could just have people's attention, please. Whoo!
OK. well, this will be new to some of you, but one thing that the Feast of Fools has got to have is...fools!
and, due to a few extra restrictions, it's been a hard job finding them this year.
but I've done my best and I think I can safely say.
I've come up with a couple of absolute stars.
I give you...Jester Primus - Mr Angus Fergus and Jester Secundus - Mr Raj Puri!
rules of the game.
the first fool to hold the golden ball aloft is the winner.
on my whistle.
just as we discussed, chaps. Show these girls what you're made of.
a grand on the brown one.
got your message. I didn't think you were going to get in touch so soon.
did you know Richard was dead?
did you know he was dead?
I did.
did you go to his funeral?
no.
why didn't you call me?
I had to find out from his daughter!
well, you haven't exactly kept in touch.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sound curt.
I always thought I'd see him again.
Really?
richard was pretty determined not to see anyone.
I thought about him every day, Gabriel.
every day.
I'm sorry, Angie, I can't.
I can't weep for Richard Arc.
do you not approve? Well, you know, each to their own.
are you aware of the fact that I am 45th in line to the throne?
well, that's not that close, is it?
well, that's not the point. What is the point?
the point is...have you ever come on a member of the Royal Family?
hey...
I didn't see you at the party. I was working.
I had to...I was in the labs... It's OK. I understand.
no, I don't think you...
I lost my father too.
Really? Really.
accident while shooting.
is that true? As I live and breathe.
do you sometimes think that you can see him?
all the time.
only I had this terrible feeling after he died...something was wrong.
and I think I so wanted to talk to him that I must have imagined...
and it was a hallucination... Hey, come here.
hail the fools! Hail the fools!
no, stop, stop. Please.
it's my first time.
what? You're a virgin?
Yeah. Brilliant!
hail the fools! Hail the fools!
in the middle of the fight there,
I'm pretty sure I could see this girl giving me the eye.
way to go, man!
Silence!
Where's Dorian? He should be first?
very well. As Vice President of the Dandelion Club,
I shall make the first slash.
enjoying that, fools?
that was...
is it always that good?
no. No, it isn't.
I never thought it could be so...
I mean, other people told me but...
just give me two more minutes and we'll see if lightning strikes twice.
I've got a very nice bottle of bubbly.
Oh, God.
I can't believe I just...
you seduced me! I seduced you?
I've got to get out of here. What about round two?
you are...everything I hate.
you're a cold mass of ungodliness and inherited prejudice and...
No! I never, ever want to see you again!
I live next door to you! Come on!
I know we're not ideally matched but we do seem to...you know.
how DARE you!
Hey! Wait!
mate, I don't think that's rain.
keep to the side.
most of it misses.
so Raj...what did you think of your first day at Trinity?
it was interesting, but ultimately demoralising.
you got any bifter?
Yeah. I kept some in my thong!
hail the fools! Hail the fools!
dandelions!
Camelot. Are you secure? -We are secure, Avalon.
and are you quite well? Quite well, thank you.
we wish you a happy start to the term.
thank you very much.

I think my cock's touching your leg.
Raj, I thought university was going to be way better than this.
Woooh! Vote for Charlotte Arc!
now the party's getting hot.
I'm very handsome and I fuck like a champ.
well I've got news for you Dorian Gaudain: you can't have me.
again.
sorry about that ladies. Where were we?
awesome.
I'm holding my shotgun to your horse's head.
you are staring directly at my vagina.
you are trying to pull the wool over my eyes.
naughty, very naughty.
you don't want the press poking around, do you? You're hiding something.
you don't know what they're doing to me.
for fuck's sake, you are my friend but I will see you dead and dishonoured because they will tell me to do it.
Argh!

in the winter of 1969, an elite force of the U. S. Army was sent on a top-secret assignment in southeast Vietnam.

of the 10 men sent, four returned.
of those four, three wrote books about what happened.
of those three, two were published.
of those two, just one got a movie deal.

it's always the yellow frog that brings them black frog on Fridays, man.
hell, no, I didn't pee on that girl.

what scene? The scene is about emotionality. Where is it?
now it's time to flip the script! - Kirk...
be here till Chinese New Year waiting for my man to cry.
you're tangling me, you're fucking tangling me.
you're tangling me, God damn it!
Kirk, no! - Stop tailgating me, you pasty tea bag!
I'm going potty. You want to hold my dick?
shit! What are you fucking both doing, Good Lord!
we're getting this in a wide shot, right?
of course we're getting it in a fucking wide.
what, do you think I'm a dick or something?
get that fucking food...
here they come!
the planes are inbound! - Shit! Shit!
shit, shit, cocksucker, bollocks. Tropic tits!
that's the signal! Go, go, go, go, go!
let's go freaking Tet here!
goddamn shit-picking cock!
that's my shit!
mother Nature just pissed her pantsuit!
sweet. - Oh, mama!
bungle in the jungle.
more bad news from the Vietnamese set of Tropic Thunder, where a $4 million explosion charred the Asian location and the camera wasn't even rolling.
financed by hotheaded mega-mogul Les Grossman, the film is already rumored to be one month behind schedule just five days into shooting. The reason?
fingers are pointed at rookie director Damien Cockburn, who, insiders say, can't control a star-studded cast, including flatulent star of the popular Fatties franchise, Jeff Portnoy.
let me tell you something. A lot of people are disrespecting me.
they say that the movie's just about farts. It's about family, and... you! You can't do what I do.
fresh from his most recent arrest for heroin, glue and crack possession,
Portnoy was almost uninsurable.
also in the mix is Booty Sweat-hocking hip-hop hyphenate Alpa Chino.
I'm so excited, you know what I'm saying, about doing Tropic Thunder.
Hey, drink Booty Sweat, baby. Drink Booty Sweat.
but the real heavyweight on the set is five-time Academy Award winner Kirk Lazarus.
the brilliant Australian known for his bad boy antics off-screen is famous for his total immersion into any role he portrays.
well, being an actor is no different than being a rugby player or a construction worker, save for the fact that my tools are the mechanisms that trigger human emotion.
Lazarus underwent a controversial pigmentation alteration procedure in order to play the platoon's African-American sergeant, Lincoln Osiris.
Yeah!
trying to hold his own onscreen with Kirk is action juggernaut Tugg Speedman.
once the highest grossing star in the world, lately his Scorcher films have lost their heat.
recently, Speedman opened up to Tyra.
you have no real family.
you're on the wrong side of 40. You're childless and alone.
somebody close to you said, "One more flop and it's over."
somebody said they were close to me?
it's been a tough year for Tugg.
the disappointing buddy comedy Chitlin' & the Dude was followed by an ill-advised venture into serious dramatic territory.
simple Jack, the story of a mentally impaired farmhand who can talk to animals, was a box office disaster that many critics called, "One of the worst movies of all time.
I ain't got a good brain.
I think you've got a fine brain, Jack.
you make me happy.
but now the question is, can Speedman make audiences happy in what's being called the most expensive - war movie never made? - Rick Peck.
wishing Tugg all the best on that one.
Rum-Tum-Tuggernauts, it's the Pecker. You got time for your agent?
Rick? - Hey, buddy, guess who I'm staring at right now.
what? - I'm looking at your ugly mug on the back cover of Vanity Fair magazine, holding a cute, cuddly panda from Cutesville.
it is insane, bro. You are a rock star.
Hey, did you get the gift basket I sent?
from Rick.
Yeah. Yeah. It's cool, man. Thanks.
all right, that is a real satellite phone, bro.
do not re-gift.
Hey. You see that Access Hollywood piece?
Yeah, I did. It was like pistol-whipping a blind kid.
I mean, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, Tugg. You are a huge star, all right?
but right now, you're like that kid on the playground, you know, the one who has lice that none of the other kids want to play with?
what do you mean? - I mean we gotta shave your head and get you back on the monkey bars, right?
what?
how did the crying scene go?
horrible. Lazarus started crying.
then he starts drooling and dribbling, and it wasn't even in the script...
stop right there!
you gotta buck up here, Tuggboat.
who cares how much more talented he may be than you?
if he cries, you cry harder, man.
didn't your dog have, like, leukemia or something when you were a kid? I mean, think of that.
boom! End of story. They hook up the TiVo yet?
good gosh.
what? - The TiVo, they hook it up?
no. The guy didn't come. - What?
for fuck's sake, that is unacceptable.
they have digital cable, but, I mean, it's okay.
no, no, no. Come on, man. It's not okay.
it is not okay, Tugg!
and you don't need to explain to me why you need TiVo or clean water, clean sheets, food, shelter.
I mean, I fought for that in your contract.
how's the adoption thing coming, buddy?
not too great.
I feel like all the good ones are gone.
well, at least you get to choose yours.
I'm stuck with mine.
tell you what, get back to work, genius soldier.
the Pecker's on a TiVo mission for the Y-O-U.
work on those tears, my man.
all right. Yeah.
say it for me one time.
you make me happy. - Make me happy.
I love you, buddy. - All right, bye.
crisis meeting? What does that mean, exactly?
I mean, are we in a crisis?
he's the head of the studio.
he's reaching out. We're 10, 000 miles away.
he just wants a little face-time.
I know, it's just you said that he called it a crisis meeting. So...
it's Les Grossman. He throws these words around.
"Crisis," "explosion," "not rolling," "fired.
these are just words.
Yeah! Yeah!
keep a secret? A camera truck in London just plowed into Judi Dench.
trust me, he's got bigger problems.
look, he may be able to see me, but I can't see him.
move! Move! Hello, Les! Hello! - Get your ass out of my...
your feet were on my desk. - Can he see us?
I don't know why we don't have...
get him a Diet Coke. Les! It's working!
Yeah, whatever you're doing right there. Hello, Les!
Hello, Les! - Okay.
we got you loud and clear here, Les.
I see you. I see you. I see you.
which one of you fuckfaces is Damien Cockburn?
that's me, sir.
it's good to finally meet you at last, get some face-time.
and who here is the key grip? You? You.
hit that director in the face, really fucking hard.
sorry, man.
this is your fault, you limey fuck!
you shit the money-bed, my friend.
what? - God damn it, Damien!
with all due respect, Les Grossman did not blow up the jungle.
what? - Fuck the jungle.
Exactly!
come on, man.
Hey, Les, I understand if you're angry, but I am dealing with a bunch of prima donnas!
clowns! Tugg Speedman, he can't cry! He can't cry!
you know how you handle an actor? They whine about anything, you pull down their pants and you spank their ass.
you spank that ass, Les. - What?
spanking a child turns him into a little snot.
fear makes him a man.
I know a place where a man's worth is measured in the ears hanging from his dog tags.
the real deep shit.
you wanna make this movie right?
that's where you take your pansy-ass actors.
who is this guy?
les, that's Four Leaf.
sergeant Four Leaf Tayback. I wrote the book.
you're a great American. This nation owes you a huge debt.
now shut the fuck up and let me do my job!
look, Cockburn. - Yes.
from now on, my fist is gonna be so far up your shithole that every time you have a thought, it's gonna have to tiptoe past my wedding ring.
take control of your actors, or I will shut you down.
diet Coke!
one week down, two weeks behind,
GI Joe can't cry, don't matter 'cause you ain't got the camera turned on anyway.
let's party!
man, you better get your shit straight, or I'll be on the next NetJet out of here, baby. You feel me?
you feel that? - Yeah.
here comes another. There we go. Now what?
Sandusky. Good. - Hey, Mr. Cockburn.
we need to have a cast meeting right now.
right now? Awesome. - Yes.
you actually care, don't you?
Yeah, it's a huge deal for me, are you kidding?
I've spent the past two years of my life living off residuals from a anti-herpes medication commercial.
I know, you're the only one who auditioned, the only one who did the two-week boot camp.
Hey, hey, Alpa.
I'm the director. He's... I need to speak to my actor.
all right, hold up. Chino?
what? Hell, yo. What's up, baby?
this about the Booty Sweat cross-promotion?
no, it's about the film.
Oh, the film and Booty Sweat's the same thing. Give him a shot.
Hey, how you doing, Jeff?
who are you? - That's awesome, man.
Kevin. Kevin Sandusky. I play Brooklyn, we've been working together.
Oh, right, right. I like you.
man, it's a real honor to be here...
I can tell it's gonna be a good experience.
I'm really having a good time.
Hey, can you help me out, man? I'm looking for this guy.
the grip with the bandana. He's got a package for me.
there he is, fucker. Dragon!
what the fuck? Oh, buddy!
I'm gonna go shoot a video, right?
I'm gonna have V. C. Soldiers in the video doing the noodle-legs, Damien.
hell, yeah, do it. V. C. Soldiers doing the hip-hop bunny hop, Damien.
it's good, I love it, great. But I need to...
V. C. Soldiers doing the seizure, baby. Hit it, baby.
hell yeah, get it. Get it, Cornbread.
Alpa!
yo, check it out. Donny on the phone.
Hello? Yo, yo, Donny!
can we call him back? I've got to have a cast meeting.
when we put aside our differences, we see we're kind of the same.
when we put aside our differences, we see we're kind of the same.
let's be friends.
I know we can do great things together.
that's a quotation from a children's book I co-wrote,
the Boy Everybody Was Jealous Of.
I think it pertains to the journey...
simple Jack sucked ass!
all right, who said that? It's not funny.
whoever it is, it's not funny, okay?
when the herd loses its way, the shepherd must kill the bull that leads them astray.
four Leaf? - Come on over. It's okay.
sit down. - Yes.
so, you don't like the hotel? - Beds give me nightmares.
I'm guessing right about now you couldn't find a Dixie coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your prick and showing you the way.
what?
you're a riddle with no cheese to maze through.
don't you get it?
no, I don't. I'm a cock of the mouse or something. I don't know.
I put my story in your limp Brit hands, and you are not going to fail me.
you think I was just blowing my own bagpipe in that meeting?
you must put those boys in the shit.
what? I don't understand.
you wanna make your movie or not? - Yes, I do.
all right, you get some of those little video type cameras.
we take them out there, and we put them in the trees in different angles.
then you give me and that pyromaniac Cody all the smoke bombs, charges, explosives, detonators you got.
then we take those boys up there, me and Cody, we could light up that fucking jungle, so those lily-dick actors would be shitting their pants and screaming for their mammies.
they'd be begging for a body bag if it means a ride home.
I could do it.
I could shoot the whole thing guerrilla style. Gritty, dirty.
get them away from their helpers and ass-licking assistants.
put them in the real shit.
real shit. - With real fear in their eyes!
real fear, real emotion! Yes, Four Leaf, yes!
Yes! Yes! - Yes! Yes!
take them off the fucking grid!
you are no longer actors in a movie!
you are five men in a helicopter!
with three other men!
how long are we gonna be gone, anyways?
cause I left most of my vitamins back at the hotel.
save your breath, maggots! - That's right, maggots!
M&M?
M&M?
go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!
move it, maggots, move! Move, grunts, move your ass!
get out, you wriggly worms!
it's up too high! - Move, move, move!
see you in hell!
this is bullshit! I gotta at least call my fucking assistant.
fucking! Jesus! Dude!
you're sitting on a nest of hostile enemy V. C.
congratulations, Fats. You just got us all killed.
anybody else care to give away our position to Charlie?
cell phones!
what the hell, Damien?
weren't no cell phones in '69, man. I'm head-to-toe legitimate.
gentlemen, I've got good news and bad news.
the studio wants to shut us down. That's the bad news.
and the good news.
if you wanna save this movie, you will become a unit.
your objective is to head north to the D'ang Kwook River and liberate the POW camp, at which point Four Leaf will get himself captured, at which point you will rescue him, at which point we will chopper you home!
damn.
four Leaf, since you're the staff sergeant, there's the map, this is the scene list.
think you can handle it?
we have rigged this entire valley of death with hidden cameras.
and I will be shooting as well, from unseen vantage points, so that every glorious moment is captured on film.
and believe me, gentlemen, it will be glorious.
if it looks real, chances are it probably is.
you wanted to be actors.
you wanted to occupy the skin of another human being.
well, get ready to occupy the skin of a terrified U. S. Infantry grunt, surrounded by death, crawling up Satan's bottom.
there'll be ambushes, enemy fire, your own little personal slice of 'Nam.
this radio goes to the chopper and the chopper only.
the chopper is God, and I am Jesus Christ, his son.
you are my chosen disciples.
and no one gets to go home till we get the shots.
put on your war faces, gentlemen.
now, let's go and make the greatest war movie ever!
Yeah! - All right!
Yeah!
Yeah!
we have an explosion in the Northern Sector
track and follow
not bad, Cockburn!
not bad.
wherever you are!
wherever he is? Looks like he's all over the place.
here we go.
must be an old French mine.
it's a remnant from colonial Indo-China. This jungle must be full of them.
don't you get it? He's messing with our heads.
that's what all that playing God stuff was about.
he's trying to get us to act good, save the movie.
he ain't playing God. He's being judged by him.
that's our objective. Complete the mission.
we have encountered a heavily armed American military force
D. E.A?
no offense, Kirk, I know you're the big fancy actor here, but I've done a lot more effects-driven event films than you. Okay?
and I think I can spot a prop head when I see one.
Oh, Jesus.
it's corn syrup, guys. Corn syrup and latex.
warm, blood-flavored corn syrup.
Oh, God.
smoke and mirrors, guys. Welcome to the movie factory.
oldest trick in the book.
he getting down now.
Oh, my God!
whoa, look at me!
you're going to get the shots, and I'm going to make sure because I'm the director.
I'm from London. I direct plays.
Hey, Damien! We got our war faces on!
they have no fear of death
bring them back dead or alive.
look, I'm Dave Beckham.
so, we gotta light these boys up today, huh?
blow some sense into these young men.
Hey, I don't want to come off as weird or anything, but I might be your biggest fan. Yeah.
tropic Thunder. Kind of like my Catcher in the Rye.
Yeah, I've never been in the military, per se, but I have lost an appendage in the line of duty.
driving Miss Daisy, first studio gig.
Yeah.
it's a pretty cool sidearm you got there. What is it?
I don't know what it's called.
I just know the sound it makes when it takes a man's life.
okay.
Damien, we're go for explosion.
ready to kick the tires and light the fires on your say-so.
Damien, we're go for explosion.
do you copy?
I got an itchy trigger finger here, and I'm ready to blow some shit up.
all right, you happy now? Can we do the scene?
or do you need a formal invitation? Come on, let's go!
here. Okay.
scene 12, exterior, jungle clearing, day, ambush.
four Leaf notices movement in the brush.
a dozen guerrilla fighters can be seen moving in the tree line.
somewhere a mine explodes. And you.
I got a bad feeling on this one.
Yeah. - No, that's your line.
I got... Now? - Yeah, but scared. Like, scared.
I got a bad feeling on this one. - Dude, wait, like how?
I got a bad feeling on this one.
okay. - Action. Go, come on.
I got a bad feeling on this one there, Fats.
our asses don't get fragged in this bullshit valley, first thing I'm doing is paying my two bucks so I can watch Brooklyn bust his cherry on a sweet little mama-san's dinky dau poontang.
shit, Brooklyn be bagged and tagged before he get any cooch.
he die, he probably die a coochless motherfucker.
zip it, Motown.
don't you worry, Brooklyn.
you got a lot of days of fucking ahead of you.
man, I'm thirsty.
might as well have some of this Booty Sweat I got back in Danang.
yo, asshole! This motherfucker's dead!
ain't no Criss Angel Mindfreak,
david Blaine trapdoor horseshit jumping off here!
Hey! You wanna get on the train here, or do you wanna ruin another take?
there ain't no goddamn takes, ain't no goddamn motion picture!
you sure? - Yeah.
yeah? - For certain, man.
then why are you still in character?
I know, but I don't have to tell you.
you don't know.
man, I don't drop character till I done a DVD commentary.
you happy now? We're out of position for the effects!
get down, fool!
didn't anyone read the script? This is the ambush!
this feels pretty real! - Exactly! Let's use it.
Yeah!
Yeah!
eat lead!
they're busting caps like a motherfucker down there.
this is FUBAR. I say we juice them.
what do you think? - Juice them.
fuck you, Charlie!
big-ass titties!
look at that, huh?
and cut!
that's the trailer right there.
Yeah!
what do we do now? - Yeah.
North. Man said to head north.
did you see me shooting? - That's how we do. Good work, baby.
I believed it.
D'ang Kwook River.
I'm betting he's got more of these battles and Viet Congs rigged for us along the way.
sergeant Osiris, get your men. Load and lock.
real, baby, I'm real.
let's go! We got a lot of klicks to cover!
hump it up, gentlemen! Single formation.
don't dawdle now!
D-Rod, D-Rod, this is Puddingface. How are we coming on that hotplate?
something's up. I think we better drag ass back there.
make sure Damien ain't forgot how to use his talkbox again.
Yeah, baby, come on. Just a little taste.
what are you doing, Jeff? - Fucking... Nothing, man!
I'm eating jellybeans. - Wow, I love jellybeans. Can I please...
no, you can't have any fucking jellybeans.
they're mine.
you think you're the only one who gets sick when he doesn't have his jellybeans?
boundaries, man. Fuck.
Hey. I didn't mean to show you up back there.
it's just, I feel like we really need to set the example for the other guys.
it's gonna be tough, but I think Damien's gonna get some great shit out of us.
just wish I had a director like this on Jack.
on Jack. What? Jack? What you talking about?
simple Jack. - Oh, yeah.
simple Jack, yeah. You went all out on that one, huh?
you did. Really swung for the fences, huh?
thank you. Thanks. Yeah.
Yeah, it was an intense experience, you know.
I just did the work.
watched a lot of retarded people. Spent time with them. Observed them.
watched all the retarded stuff they did.
then again, I always found mere observation in and of itself is a tad rudimentary.
sometimes, we gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional pay dirt.
thus, we can diagram the source of the pain and then live it, you know.
Yeah, yeah, live it. Yeah, exactly.
you know, there were times when I was doing Jack that I actually felt retarded, - like really retarded. - Oh, yeah.
I mean, I brushed my teeth retarded, - I rode the bus retarded. - Damn.
in a weird way, I had to sort of just free myself up to believe that it was okay to be stupid or dumb.
to be a moron. - Yeah.
to be moronical. - Exactly, to be a moron.
an imbecile. - Yeah.
like the dumbest motherfucker that ever lived.
when I was playing the character.
when you was the character. - Yeah, as Jack, definitely.
Jack, stupid ass Jack.
trying to come back from that.
in a weird way it was almost like I had to sort of fool my mind into believing that it wasn't retarded, and by the end of the whole thing, I was like, Wait a minute, I flushed so much out, how am I gonna jumpstart it up again?
it's just like... Right? - Yeah.
you was farting in bathtubs and laughing your ass off.
Yeah.
but Simple Jack thought he was smart, or rather, didn't think he was retarded, so you can't afford to play retarded, being a smart actor.
playing a guy who ain't smart but thinks he is, - that's tricky. - Tricky.
it's like working with mercury. It's high science, man. It's an art form.
Yeah. - You an artist.
that's what we do, right? Yeah. - Yeah.
hats off for going there, especially knowing how the Academy is about that shit.
about what? - You're serious? You don't know?
everybody knows you never go full retard.
what do you mean? - Check it out.
Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man, looked retarded, act retarded, not retarded.
count toothpicks, cheat at cards. Autistic, sure. Not retarded.
then you got Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump.
slow, yes, retarded, maybe, braces on his legs.
but he charmed the pants off Nixon, and he won a Ping-Pong competition.
that ain't retarded.
and he was a goddamn war hero. You know any retarded war heroes?
you went full retard, man.
never go full retard.
you don't buy that? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I Am Sam.
remember? Went full retard? Went home empty-handed.
Oh, my God! Holy shit!
good job, turd. You killed the director.
no, that's impossible, man.
I rigged the whole tree line, and this is here.
he must have missed his mark. - Missed his mark?
Yeah, this isn't me.
come on, let's bag and tag the bastard and get back to the hotel.
you're in a world of hurt, dumbo! - We're in a world of hurt!
you're in trouble. - This isn't just on me!
we're in a... We're together on this. - Bullshit.
you're just gonna run away. You're gonna leave.
what happened to, "No man left behind," okay?
just wait, just wait! Listen! Listen, okay?
I don't wanna hear it. - Let me just be real with you, all right?
I almost blinded Jamie Lee Curtis on Freaky Friday, okay?
this shit will fucking ruin me!
just get off me! You're pathetic. - No, I'm not.
get off me! - You are not going back!
what the fuck? - Now wait a minute.
so, what? We're just supposed to keep walking?
try to stay in character. Remember, we're on camera.
this thing's too heavy.
I want the rubber one that the prop guy gave me.
Where's the fucking prop guy?
how's it going with that map, chief?
can I have a look at it? - I got it.
Yeah, Damien gave it to me, remember?
Yeah, but he gave it to you for us.
Yeah. - Okay.
I got it. - You got it upside down.
thank you.
letters go one way and the numbers another.
dude, I'm trying to... I got your back, man.
well, I'm cool. All right, I'm cool. - You are?
is your character dyslexic?
no, my character's not dyslexic. - So you a cartographer.
I'm tired, I want to go home.
why, so you can get back and make Fatties: Fart 20, or some shit?
it's Fatties: Fart Two, there's no... Hey, you wish you had a Fatties franchise.
what? - It's Fatties: Fart Two.
Yeah, you do. - I don't want no Fatties franchise, - I got a diamond toilet. - Your stupid-ass commercials.
you're all fucked up, man, you look tired.
you look like you bumped your head or something, so I came over to see if you're fucking all right, that's all.
Yeah, why don't you get on point? - I'm on point right here.
...my farts are fucking more beautiful than...
you still got that shit upside down.
the numbers help, man, the numbers...
the letters go across the top and then the numbers.
want the map? - Yeah, I want the fucking map.
well, you can't have it, 'cause Damien gave it me.
you wish you had my farts, my farts are fucking music.
all right. That's enough.
everybody's obviously a little bushed from all this humping.
so take a chow break. Chow break!
but stay alert.
remember, Charlie don't care if you're on break or not.
all right, that's lunch. Coming back to the same scene afterwards, Lost in the goddamn jungle.
captain Simple Jack.
fuck you.
I fucking hate movies.
this is bullshit. I don't wanna be in this shitty movie.
No! That's my jellybeans! No!
kid, grab the bat! Please! Shit!
yo, man, I got a Bust-A-Nut. - You go to hell! There he is.
God damn it! Okay. Where'd he go?
you little piece of shit! I'm gonna fucking rip your wings off!
Sanducci. Hold up, man, keep it on the down-low.
I don't really gotta piss. I'm trying to talk at you, man.
bait, I need bait.
you went to boot camp, right? You can read a map?
Yeah, I think so.
I know Speedman got everyone convinced we out here making Planet of the Apes on YouTube or some shit, but I don't buy it.
you wanna step on a real landmine? You wanna die?
you wanna get shot by a real motherfucker?
keep looking ahead, man. - No, of course not.
trying to get home, man.
got a big job coming up next year.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
it's about Abe Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth when they were both young.
Oh, wow! - Yeah.
that's a classy picture. - Dude, you kind of look like Abe.
slap a beard on you.
what's your fucking name? - Really? It's Kevin.
Kevin Sandusky.
if I can put that map in your hands, can I count on you?
well, yeah, I guess you can. - Dynamite. I'm out.
that smelled just like bologna for some reason.
is anyone gonna fucking help me get this fucking thing?
why are they even out in the daytime?
I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you.
Lazarus is gonna torpedo the movie.
he's way out on a limb with this character, and I think he's getting cold feet.
and the men respect you, 'cause you went to boot camp and rehearsal.
can I count on you, Kyle. - It's Kevin.
good.
if you want I could give the map a look-see.
I'll handle the map. - Okay.
you stick with the program, we get this movie in the can,
I'm thinking there could be a Teen Choice Award in it for you.
you have that potential. They'll slime you, the whole deal.
Yeah, that's wicked. - Good.
there it is! Yeah, now you're dead!
you O. D.'d!
hold up now, Jeff.
fucking hell!
what the hell, Jeff? That's a bat, man!
I don't have any more jellybeans.
you land there!
Wow. Look at these ruins.
where the hell are we? - D'ang Kwook River.
that so? How do you know that? How you sure?
only one way to find out, dude. Let's go.
Yeah. I'm not feeling so good right now. Seriously, my skin hurts!
enough from the peanut gallery! Into the water, ladies!
no, man. Let me take a look at that map right quick.
why is everybody all obsessed with the map?
cause we're tired of being your trail donkeys!
acting like you some one-man GPS!
God damn it! We lost! We fucking super lost, man!
tell him, McClusky. Tell him what time it is.
I don't believe you people.
what do you mean "you people"?
what do you mean, "you people"?
I think what Tugg means is...
no, look at his eyes, man.
...you people, you actors. You people... - Look at them beady, white devil eyes.
I gotta get back to the hotel, for real!
hell, no! - Silence!
chill! All right? Just chill it.
now, let's go get those Viet Congs.
viet Cong! - What?
it's "Viet Cong." There's no "S." It's already plural.
you wouldn't say "Chineses.
all right, that's enough of this insubordination!
if the machine breaks down, we break down.
Hey, man, you know how in Rambo I, he was big but a little puffy and then Rambo II, he got all shredded up?
Yeah. - That's kind of how you look right now.
yeah? - Not Rambo I but II.
Really? - Yeah, when he was cut up.
I'm not that... I mean, that's what I'm going for, but you know...

Thanks. - What's the secret, dude?
it's a diet. I'm just dieting. - Really?
cause I'm trying to come up a little, but it's just... It's tough.

that's fucking bullshit
it's a chump move.
we just getting a second opinion, doc.
we're going the wrong way!
Damn! - Son of a bitch.
God! I think we were supposed to be doing this, and instead we did this.
shit, shit, shit, shitty shit, shit!
think you can get us back to that drop zone, boy?
this is not cool!
maybe.
this is insane!
are you really going to abandon this movie?
we're supposed to be a unit!
suck my unit!
all right, fine.
I'll finish it by myself. - You go be all you can be, man.
Tugg, you have no idea where you're going!
Yes, I do!
I'm going to, "Exterior, rain forest, dusk.
smash cut to Four Leaf, who treks alone through a frightening jungle.
suck on that unit, Kirk!
come on, men. Let's get home.
Hello, Mr. Mantis. You're beautiful.
now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo where Hollywood was split into schisms, some studios backing Blu-ray Disc, others backing HD DVD.
people thought it would come down to pixel rate or refresh rate, and they're pretty much the same.
what it came down to was a combination of gamers and porn.
now, whichever format porno backs is usually the one that becomes the most successful.
but, you know, Sony, every PlayStation 3 has a Blu-ray in it.
you talking to me this whole time?
I was talking to whoever was listening to me.
Jesus Christ, man!
booty Sweat.
Oh, God!
it's cold! It's freezing. I'm fucking cold.
you want my flak jacket?
what, are you insane? It's boiling! It's like a sweat lodge out here!
keep the volume down on that bitching, Flatch Adams.
I gotta take a fucking 12-pound shit!
how we doing? We making good time? - We're making good time, but there's no way we make it over that ridge before sundown.
all right, fellas, we're gonna make camp, rest up!
Oh, God. - Y'all might be in for a treat.
you know, back before the war broked out,
I was a saucier in San Antone.
I bet I could collar up some of them greens.
Yeah, noodle some crawfish out the paddy, yo.
and maybe some crab apples for dessert, now, you hear? Hell, yeah!
hell, yeah!
that's how we all talk. We all talk like this, suh! Yes, suh.
Yeah, get some crawfish and some ribs.
you're Australian! Be Australian! Excuse me, Kangaroo Jack.
I get excited about my foods, man.
die!
No!
dude, dude, what the hell is going on here? Where are we?
I have no idea.
I've never been outside the States.
wait, what? Are you fucking kidding me?
did you make this whole goddamn thing up?
dude, were you even in the fucking service?
Yes. Of course. Coast Guard.
coast Guard. - Sanitation Department.
Oh, my God! You're a fucking garbage man!
damn it. F. L. Tayback lies to me and the whole goddamn U. S. Of A.
I wrote the book as a tribute! I'm a patriot!
Yeah, you're the Milli Vanilli of patriots, okay?
you lied about fighting the Vietnam War.
it's like punching the American flag in the face, God damn it.
God, and to think I believed in you!
I don't wanna be next to you. - Writers lie all the time.
can I be tied to another post? Okay.
Rick? - Tugg.
I killed one, Rick.
the thing I love most in the world.
Vivica, get off the line now!
a hooker. All right, you killed a hooker.
calm down. Here's what you're gonna do.
get your hands on some bleach, some hydrogen peroxide and a shitload of lime.
no, a panda.
I killed a panda.
Amanda? Come on, dude.
I mean, that's probably not even her real name.
no, a panda!
a panda?
a sweet, cuddly, vicious little panda.
Jesus Christ, Tugg! Man, don't scare me like that!
it's beautiful here.
you on the set?
I am the set.
all right, man. Hey, how's the TiVo working out?
screw TiVo.
I'm way beyond TiVo.
last I checked, they hadn't hooked it up, though.
hadn't hooked it up? No TiVo?
it doesn't matter anymore.
I've moved on.
where have you moved on to?
another agency?
who's with you?
it's Nick Stevens, isn't it? That little fucker.
you are still my client, Tugg Speedman! I am getting the TiVo!
jacket's on, I'm out the door!
Tugg?
please don't fire me.
I did it, I did it!
Vivica, what do I have scheduled this afternoon?
two and a Half Men taping. - Shit.
cancel it.
and get me Tugg's Tropic Thunder contract.
I'm going to Grossman's office, I'm playing the card.
okay.
Oh, mama. Thirsty.
he doesn't look too good.
must drink, so I can throw something up!
no, no. Don't drink that water! That water's like a petri dish!
no, don't!
Alpa, do you have any Booty Sweat?
Yeah, get him chugging on some of Alpa's ass water.
that'll bring him around. It's a cure-all.
man, what you coming out in movies for anyway?
did you need another revenue stream?
for your information, my revenue stream currently generates $2 million a year in charitable contributions for my community.
hot damn. - And why am I in this movie?
maybe I just knew I had to represent, because they had one good part in it for a black man and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee.
pump your brakes, kid. That man is a national treasure.
I just wanted to throw another shrimp on your barbie.
that shit ain't funny.
Hey, fellas! It's hot! We're tired! It stinks!
I'm just fucking with you, Kangaroo Jack!
I'm sorry a dingo ate your baby.
you know that's a true story? Lady lost her kid.
you about to cross some fucking lines. - Guys, relax and stuff.
you know what? Fuck that, man!
I'm sick of this koala-hugging nigger telling me...
for 400 years, that word has kept us down.
what the fuck?
it took a whole lot of trying just to get up that hill.
now we up in the big leagues, getting our turn at bat.
long as we live, it's you and me, baby.
that's the theme song for The Jeffersons. You really need help.
Yeah. Just 'cause it's the theme song, don't make it not true.
you know what? I'm gonna tell you what's true.
I'm gonna tag you back. You better believe that, baby.
guys! Hey, guys!
Jeff, stay away from that animal.
I'm gonna bite his hide. I need...
I need to wear his stomach skin like a unitard.
ain't nobody doing nothing to no one or body!
now, if Mr. Portnoy is feeling a little flu-ish, don't wanna walk, put him up on that cloven-hoof animal!
we got ground to cover!
all right, POW camp, scene 67.
bring it on, Cockburn!
maybe he's not, you know, Ridley Scott or something, but I think Renny Harlin's a tremendous filmmaker like, Adventures of Ford Fairlane, you know, as far as an Andrew Dice Clay vehicle goes, it's pretty decent.
and Cliffhanger. Cliffhanger's incredible.
as far as the whole like, man against nature type of movies go, it's absolutely amazing.
shut the fuck up!
who send you here?
Tayback, John, Sergeant, United States Army.
serial number 694529987.
perhaps some hot tea will make conversing a little easier.
my leader's not quite as cordial.
look, what? I just thought you might like some hot tea - in order to calm your nerves. - Tayback, John, Sergeant,
united States Army, 694529987.
and here's a little message from my Uncle Sam.
dude, you all right?
man you totally leaned into that.
I was pulling it back and you just came in too...
Hey, it was an accident, man.
come on, good. You want to keep going?
let's go. - Get up.
I rather rot in your V. C. Jail!
I'll never bend to your will! You scum! You scum!
now say this and go to the beginning again, let's do the tea part, okay?
dude, I hope you're not pissed.
I see moss on both sides of that tree.
well, you know, maybe if I wasn't the only one at boot camp...
my belly really hurts, you guys!
I'm not joking around, I'm nauseous.
let me off, I gotta puke! I don't wanna die like Hendrix!
all right. All right.
are you okay, Jeff?
I'm awesome.
holy shit!
okay. Everyone, down, down, down.
man. Now I'm tripping.
that looks like the POW camp from out the script, yo.
Speedman was right?
I don't think so.
look at the cooking vats, the armed guards.
looks like a heroin processing plant.
we were in that chopper for hours.
I don't even think we're in Vietnam anymore.
fuck. - Shit. We ain't even in 'Nam?
no, most likely Myanmar or Laos.
what the fuck is Laos?
it's the Golden Triangle.
Oh, fuck. We're dead.
no one gets out of here. I saw it on TV.
fucking boats, airplanes, UFOs and shit, they all just vanish!
yo, that's the Bermuda Triangle, dumbass.
this is the Golden Triangle.
it's the world's hard drug superhighway.
how do you know that?
it was a really long trip. I read the in-flight magazine.
cut!
Oh, Jesus!
what do you see, man? I'm blocked.
Damien, cut!
Hey, Damien, cut!
they got Speedman.
and it doesn't look good.
I am Tran.
you are a trespasser in my poppy fields.
you are D. E.A. Scum!
were there some re-writes that I missed?
do you want to die?
do you? - No!
please, don't hurt me!
say that again.
please, don't hurt me.
No! Like you did before! Say it!
say it!
please, don't hurt me!
what? - You are Simple Jack.
you saw Simple Jack?
we love the tale of this man, Simple Jack.
we do not have many luxury here.
and Simple Jack is the only movie we possess.
you got the VHS.
we've watched it many, many times.
you should've got Oscar.
well, you know. It's...
just to be nominated...
you were nominated?
no, no, no. I wasn't nominated.
I'm just saying that to have been nominated would have been nice.
it's just... It's very political. You have to take out ads...
shut up now! - Okay. Okay.
so, are you going to let me go, or...
no. We'll hold you for ransom.
much more money now!
he's in a meeting.
Yeah, I know. In about two seconds with the Pecker.
I'm gonna rip your fucking tits off.
you wanna talk about trouble? That's trouble.
what do you need, Peck?
no, more like what do you need, Les?
glasses?
what?
so you can read the Tropic Thunder contract that guarantees my client, Tugg Speedman, some form of digital video recorder on location.
huh? - I can't believe you let him in.
look, fuckstick, I'm incredibly busy, so why don't you get the hell out of here before I snap your dick off and jam it into your ass?
no, not you, Helen.
but I will rip your tits off if you don't get me those theaters.
perfect.
Hey, Tuggernuts, I've got you on speakerphone.
I'm standing here with Les Grossman, and he is dying to tell you why he's apparently wiped his ass with the TiVo clause from your contract.
we are Flaming Dragon.
Speedman is with us now.
for 50 million, you will get him back.
are you gonna get those... - Who is this?
and how did you get this phone? - We are Flaming Dragon!
simple Jack belong to us now.
he does, does he?
let me tell you something, shitbird.
I've never even heard of your little agency.
but if you think you can poach my client...
send $50 million, or you no see Simple Jack again because we kill him.
this is Les Grossman. Who is this?
this is Flaming Dragon!
okay. Flaming Dragon. Fuckface.
first, take a big step back and literally fuck your own face!
now, I don't know what kind of pan-Pacific bullshit power play you're trying to pull here, but Asia, Jack, is my territory.
so whatever you're thinking, you better think again.
otherwise, I'm gonna have to head down there, and I will rain down an ungodly fucking firestorm upon you.
you're gonna have to call the fucking United Nations and get a fucking binding resolution to keep me from fucking destroying you.
I am talking scorched earth, motherfucker!
I will massacre you!
I will fuck you up!
could you find out who that was? Go. - Yeah. Yeah.
you have all been working hard.
I give you Simple Jack
you wear these. More like Simple Jack teeth.
okay.
Hey. Look, I know you're a big fan, and that's great...
put teeth in!
now do movie.
the whole movie?
I can't. I don't know the whole...
you perform! You perform or die!
monkey swine!
pa.
more stupid!
pa, why you gotta make me feel bad?
you saw what I saw.
Tugg Speedman is dead meat if we don't do something soon.
Yeah. We could do something by getting our asses back to the hotel, which is in the other direction!
ain't right.
what would've happened in The Great Escape if Steve McQueen and them dudes had turned tail and ran?
well, that's what that movie was about. They were escaping. They ran away.
I'm trying to agree with you. The point is they did something.
then what are we supposed to do, huh?
cause he's cleaning a gun with no bullets. Yeah, that's a plan.
I'm just like a little boy, playing with his dick when he's nervous.
wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I got an idea. This might be a little crazy.
crazy's better than nothing.
back in '98, I did a low-budget titty comedy for Skinemax.
sex Camp. Remember it? - Yeah.
anyway, me and the campers from the uncool camp had to break into the rich girl camp.
so, what we did, we built a catapult out of logs and underwear, and they shot us over the wall, and we parachuted down.
look, you guys, we already know the plan.
are you fucking kidding me? I'm giving you gold.
we do it just like in the book, Chapter 26, the Wet Offensive.
the book of Tropic Thunder.
Yeah, did you guys read the book?
the flap, I read the back flap and saw the pictures.
well, it's okay. It's exactly the same as in the script.
cool.
you guys all read the script, right?
I don't read the script, script reads me.
what the hell does that even mean?
what you getting at with the books, scripts? Spit that shit out, man!
all right. The Wet Offensive.
Osiris and Fats go undercover as a diversion.
motown and Brooklyn sneak in via the river.
Yeah. But those dudes was trained soldiers.
Yeah!
and we trained actors, motherfucker.
time to man up. And I ain't gonna sugarcoat.
some of us might not even make it back.
what do you mean? Like not on the same flight?
Alpa and I's already wearing earth mama's natural night camo.
cool it, Benson. - Sorry.
we gonna scout, get a plan together. We ain't back in 20, come looking.
we are Flaming Dragon.
okay.
flaming Dragon's a heroin manufacturer.
they're responsible for an eighth of the drug trade in Asia.
huge profit margin. - Guys!
would somebody please let me know what the game plan is?
peck! We have it handled.
please, don't interrupt. Everything's under control.
I got it. Got it.
les Grossman. - We not get money yet.
price now 100 million!
you pay now, or tomorrow Simple Jack die.
great. Let me get this down.
100 million.
wait! I got a better idea.
instead of 100 million, how about I send you a hobo's dick cheese?
then you kill him! Do your thing! Skin the fucking bastard!
go to town, man! Go to town!
no... - In the meantime, and as usual, go fuck yourself!
no. - We don't negotiate with terrorists.
Hey, hey, are you insane?
I think I could've done that better. - I thought it was good.
they're gonna kill him!
And?
And?
it's a cold, hard world. Shit happens.
we'll weep for him, in the press.
set up a scholarship in his name.
eventually, and I'm talking way, way down the road, we file an insurance claim.
preferably before the end of the fiscal year.
actually, the claim alone would net us more than the movie would lose.
you can't be serious.
you kick in the door to my house, all ants in your pants, sucking my left nut to get a TiVo scrap for the third runner-up Sexiest Man Alive 1998, and you're asking if I'm serious?
let's face it.
the kids aren't dressing up as Scorcher for Purim anymore.
Speedman is a dying star, a white dwarf heading for a black hole.
that's physics. It's inevitable.
we've been handed an incredible opportunity here, Peck.
the universe is talking to us right now.
you just gotta listen.
see, this is the good part, Pecker. This is when the job gets fun.
Yeah.
ask and you shall receive.
all right. - You play ball, we play ball.
I know you want the goodies.
welcome to the goody room.
you paying attention? 'Cause I'm talking G5 for the Pecker.
that's how you're gonna roll.
no more frequent flier bitch miles for my boy.
Yeah!
playa.
playa!
big dick playa.
swinging past your knees!
big dick, baby.
Yep.
or you can grow a conscience in the next five minutes and see where that takes you.
let me get this straight.
you want me to let my client of 15 years, one of my best friends, die in the jungle, alone, for some money and a G5?
Yes.
a G5 airplane?
Yes.
and lots of money.
playa.
Yeah!
smack it up, flip it, rub it down!
but Mama take care of Jack a lot.
how many more sleeps before she wakes up again?
sorry, Jack.
she in heaven now.
Damn! I thought the movie was bad.
she sleep forever.
to the man's credit, he's actually eased up on the retard throttle.
and now that's added a balance, and the audience can connect.
I mean, this is Theater 101, but, you know, he's had a tough road.
he'll become a naturalist.
Yeah. - Break down the aesthetic distance, then the...
told you I'd tag you back.
can I tell you that I'm sorry for any offense I might've caused, man?
I just got caught up in... - In being a dumbass?
I guess so.
why you still doing this Chicken George shit, I have no idea.
neither do I. - It's beyond me.
it's beyond me. - You confused.
I am a little confused. - I know.
but are we cool?
not really.
Hey, man.
how's it going? - Good. Yourself?
Hey, so, if it's no big deal,
I think I'm just gonna hang back here for the mission.
watch the stuff.
is that cool? - What? No!
we need you, Jeff.
what are you talking about?
okay, look, man.
I got something to tell you. - Okay.
you know those jellybeans I was eating?
well, they weren't jellybeans, okay?
they were drugs. - Really?
I get down there near the mother Lode, I am done. I'm jonesing bad, man.
I'm gonna fucking do all the heroin in the fucking world.
if you guys wanna make it through this thing, you gotta strap me to a tree.
are you serious? - Yeah, I'm serious. Literally, a tree.
and you can, no matter what, you can't fucking untie me until it is done, until it is out of my system.
I'm gonna say, "Hey, man, I'm cool. It's cool."
I'm finally better. I'm finally better. Untie me.
don't listen to me! Anything I fucking say is a lie!
you got it!
goodbye, Mama!
now you can have ice cream in heaven.
I'll see you tonight, when I go to bed, in my head movies.
but this head movie makes my eyes rain.
dang. Short-bus is taking some real hits.
they got him on the move! - That's torture, man.
okay. That's where they keeping him.
I gotta get cracking on my costume.
say, are you good with a needle and thread?
hell, yeah.
Alpa Chino chinos sold more than five million pairs last spring at the Gap.
I sewed them patterns myself, baby. - Let's roll out.
it's a little twig man Oscar.
I'm going to call you Half Squat.
and you can call me
Papa.
wow, look at all those stars.
really makes a guy feel pretty small.
this could be the last time we look at these stars.
man, that's beauty.
nights like tonight make a man wonder what it's all about.
Hey, you guys. Anybody got some bug spray?
don't ignore me!
stick it out, man. We're gonna get through this.
Hey, Kirk? - Yeah?
are you still dating Jennifer Love Hewitt?
cause I think she's hot.
no, that was just some tabloid conjecture.
Hey, guys, I'm good. I made it through. You can untie me now.
funny, huh?
the circus life 280 days a year on location.
it's hard to find a girl that can hang with that, you know?
not one worth keeping, nohow.
Hey, Radar? Evans?
no, it's Kevin.
Kev, whatever the fuck. Come over here.
I didn't tell you, but Fatties: Fart Three is coming down the pike, and there's a role in there for you if you come over and untie me.
Jeff, you're just going to have to tough it out.
your mother's a cankerous whore!
Jesus, man.
Hey, man.
remember way back when I said your mother was a cankerous whore?
I'm sorry, man. I did not mean that. She's not.
how about you, man?
you got some little minx waiting for you on the other side of tomorrow?
me?
I've barely even had a girlfriend, and...
I was really hoping I'd get laid when this movie came out, but that's not gonna happen.
what about you, Masterblaster?
you got a certain someone you trying to get with back in the States?
what, Alpa Chino? He's like 10 girls deep, 24/7.
no. You missing me, man.
I'm talking about something special. Big difference.
how about it?
Yeah.
Yeah, there is.
well? What's the skinny? Y'all been on a date or what?
no. I mean...
I always wanted to, but I guess I just never had the courage to ask.
it's... It's complicated.
No! It's simple as pie, man.
you plant your feet in the ground, you look her square in the eyes, you say, "Hey, baby, you and me's going on a date." That's the end of story.
what's her name? - Lance.
listen here, Lance...
Lance? What the fuck did I just hear? Lance?
did you say "Lance"? - No!
that sounded like "Lance." - No, I said "Nance.
that's what I said, "Nance." - It sounded like "Lance.
look, I'm Alpa Chino, okay?
I love the pussy! All right?
lay your ass back down and look at the stars.
when you wrote I Love Tha Pussy was you thinking of dangling your dice on Lance's forehead?
Oh, hell, no! What? Come on. Look.
man, everyone's gay once in a while. - I'm not gay!
this Hollywood.
how about we all get back to work?
okay. Cool. - This is ridiculous!
we got a big day tomorrow. Let's get focused.
Alpa, if you untie me, I will literally suck your dick right now.
I told you, for the last time, I love the pussy!
I'll cradle the balls, stroke the shaft, work the pipe and swallow the gravy.
get it over here, buddy. Let's do this.
okay, so, what's the plan?
are you gonna talk Vietnamese to those dudes?
no. No. Mandarin Chinese.
which, from what I can tell, is what they speaking down there.
how the hell do you know Chinese?
land of Silk and Money with Gong Li. Second Globe, third Oscar.
prepped for that one by working in a Beijing textile factory for eight months.

Chillness and calmness!

I will return happily to my poppy field.

Oh yes... I grow... both.

Yes, your farm.

that's right, we running this program now, J. P.

don't judge me!
he's got a real serious problem.
Hey! Hey, you!

I just know the sound it makes when it lies.

I'm gonna put on this thing. Don't move.
I can still see you.
Tugg!
Tugg?
gotcha.
roll your shit up, man. We going home.

Hey, yo, you know what? Speak English. I don't speak that stuff.
What're you sayin'? Huh?
devil's Advocate. Dog Day Afternoon.
cruising. Sea of Love.
real Al Pacino.
get the fuck down. That's a whole different dude altogether.
what you doing? What you doing? Don't touch that gun.
don't do it! Don't touch that gun!
on my momma, if you touch that gun...
Oh, shit, it's on! - Over here!
What're you doing? - I'm gonna give these boys a Hanoi high-five.
shadow me, Pinocchio!
smoke!
Oh, shit!
Jeff, don't!
it doesn't matter what I do.
I'll always be a screw-up. No one'll ever respect me.
that is not true, you are not a screw-up! You make so many people laugh.
they only laugh at my farts.
Jeff, we really need to go now!
this is all I deserve!
laugh at that, you bastards!
hilarious! Hilarious!
let's move. We only have 16 hours before they wake up.
sounds like the dinner bell's ringing.
these assholes are gonna be crawling in here ready to fucking eat us.
there. All right, you keep six right here.
come on, let's go.
come on, what are you guys doing? Let's get out of here!
he's on tilt status.
same thing happened to me when I played Neil Armstrong in Moonshot.
they found me in an alley in Burbank trying to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere in an old refrigerator box.
What're you talking about?
come on, fellas, we really need to go.
Daggomit, Blamtucky, I ain't re-programming a VCR.
give me the flame thrower. You gotta start the chopper.
no, fuck that! Just give me this. - No time! I'll take care of this!
all right. Give me your hooks.
don't worry, I'm not gonna put them on again.
just give me your goddamn hooks. - All right. Here.
get those boys back to the bird, pronto!
shit! Enough!
fake shit!
kill him!
fuck!
go get your guys! Get them to the chopper!
I'll take care of these yahoos!
you're gonna focus up now, motherfucker, and say it.
it's me, Tugg! - It's me, Tugg.
that's right! Now, Tugg who?
Tugg who? I don't know. Who are you? - Me?
I know who I am!
I'm a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude.
what?
you a dude that don't know what dude he is!
or are you a dude who has no idea what dude he is and claims to know what dude he is...
what the fuck are you guys talking about?
...By playing other dudes? - I know what dude I am!
you're scared. - I ain't scared. Scared of what?
or scared of who?
scared of who? - Come on, guys. We really need to go!
scared of you.
Jesus. - What's going on?
the dudes are emerging.
he's right, you know.
I am not
sergeant Lincoln Osiris.
we gotta roll out.
nor am I Father O'Malley.
or Neil Armstrong.
I think I might be nobody.
the insecurity level with you guys is ridiculous!
everybody's got issues! - Yeah, man, everybody got issues.
come on! You're Kirk Lazarus.
you're the whole reason I got into acting.
I memorized every single monologue you ever did when I was in theater school.
Really? - Yeah. And look, Tugg!
I saw Scorcher I 24 times when I was in eighth grade.
that shit blew me away! I got high to that shit! You the man!
Yeah, man, Scorcher I was great. Let's get the fuck out of here!
Tugg, Tugger, you're the last piece of the puzzle, buddy.
we need you! Your men need you! Are you with us?
I'm a rooster illusion.
fuck it. We'll deal with him later.
let's move. Come on. Come on. Double time. Gotta go!
come on, come on, come on.
Bingo! Move out.
Oh, God.
just say no to this, you drug-making midget.
gotta hold on!
four Leaf!
you grew hands?
RPG, gentlemen!
where are you going?
Oh, my God. I am moving to catering after this.
my ass!
my ass!
Hey, yo! We gotta get our shit together, Tugg!
we gotta get his cracker ass to the chopper!
are you still crazy? We gotta get Candisky to the chopper!
it's Sandusky.
Kevin Sandusky. - That's my name.
you remembered my name.
Alpa, go help Cody.
Portnoy, get Sandusky back to the chopper. Go!
I got him! - Let's go!
let's get out of here!
Hey, Leaf!
Leaf!
hit the plunger - as soon as they clear the bridge! - Got it!
come on! Get in the chopper!
come on! Move! - Kirk! Wait!
Laz, I'm gonna blow the bridge!
are you the special effects guy?
you God damn right I am. - Fuck yeah!
leaf's about to blow the bridge. Come on!
you don't have to! You don't have to! I'm staying.
no, I can't let you do that, mate. We gotta go.
no, I'm telling you, I'm not being crazy. They'll listen to me.
I know it sounds weird, but I have a connection with them.
you're not doing tofu dinner theater for these motherfuckers. Let's roll!
get over here! - I have a son now. Little Half Squat.
who in crikey fuck is Half Squat?
he's my son. He's my boy!
he needs me. I have to go back to him.
you tell the world what happened here.
what happened here?
I don't know, but you need to tell them.
I got this.
Tugg!
you take care of the boys! I'll deal with these guys.
where is he going? We're gonna fucking die!
Laz, come on. He joined the circus. Let's go.
you've got hands. - Yeah.
fuck! You've got hands? - Come on!
come on! - Get in!
come on! - He's staying?
go! He's a lost cause, mate! Get out of here!
I was wrong! Blow the bridge! Blow the fucking bridge!
I got this.
leaf, no!
it's over! He's gone!
Cody! We gotta go!
look.
think he's done.
cover me!
come on! - Wait, come back!
how do we cover him?
all right, game over. Come on, mate. Come on.
you all right, man? - I'm cold.
I can't feel my legs.
no, no, they're in a puddle, mate. See? There's a puddle right there.
no worries. - Good.
come on, we gotta split, man.
you guys came back for me. - Course.
Hey! I want you to know something.
what?
I know who you are.
you're my friend.
you're my brother.
but like a really cool brother, you know?
like a brother where there was no animosity or...
don't look now, you got some real tears going.
Really?
that's the stuff that accolades are made of.
Jesus, let's go, man!
all right?
Upsy-daisy.
come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
get in! Get in!
come on! Here we go!
Tuggernuts! I got it!
Tugger! - Rick!
what the fuck?
I got the TiVo!
my friend wants a TiVo, my friend gets a TiVo!
Oh, shit!
and the Oscar goes to...
Yes! Tugg Speedman.
tropic Blunder, The True Story Behind the Making of the Most Expensive Fake True War Story Ever.
Yeah!
Yeah, you son of a bitch!
eight Oscars, $400 million and you saved Tugg Speedman's career.
I couldn't have done it without you, Slolom.
Really?
no, dickhead, of course I could.
a nutless monkey could do your job. - Well, I...
now, go get drunk and take credit at all the parties.
I would never do that to... - Joking.
yeah? - Yeah.
very... Okay, there he is.
there he is. Okay. - Go have fun.
all right. We're having a...
fuck, okay. Thank you, Les. Thank you. You have a good night...
but seriously, a nutless monkey could do your job.
good. Thank you, sir.

mother Nature just pissed her pantsuit!
Oh, no. please
big-ass titties
mother Nature just pissed her pantsuit!
Oh, hell, no! What?
what the fuck?
bait, I need bait.
Chicka-chickaw
Kwan-Lo!
I'm a lead farmer, motherfucker!
mum, call me Simple jack
you make me happy.
makes my eyes rain.
I'll cradle the balls, stroke the shaft work the pipe and swallow the gravy.
that's right
you about to cross some fucking lines
I know who I am!
I'm a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude.
get down, motherfucker that's the name of the game that's the name of the game that's the name of the game that's the name of the game
don't judge me!
if you have any silver on you, now would be the time to reveal it.
no way.
I ain't that stupid.
Yes, you are.
is there blood in my hair?
what?
is there blood in my hair?
I don't know, I...I... I can't see in this light.
how about now?
Yeah, there's a little bit of blood there. Yeah.
well, this is bad.
Pam is gonna kill me.
who the fuck is pam?
why, do you wanna meet her?
no.
I'm... I'm good.
well, you're going to.
where are you taking me?
to find out what you know.
I wouldn't try anything rash if I were you.
I'm still hungry.
another first.
how do you mean?
we've never had make-up "sex" before.
how does it compare to "you thought I was dead" sex?
that was pretty great too, but I wouldn't want to go through that again.
I had a feeling like I'd lost you.
and yet you like fighting with me.
I don't like it.
it's just... let's not get too used to it then.
we don't want to be one of those couples.
Yeah, right.
holy... I am so embarrassed I could die.
what is it?
I completely forgot she was here.
think she heard us?
no.
if she had, she'd have no compunction about letting us know it.
you know, you might want to try going a little easier on her.
it's hard enough being a teenage girl without- she is a vampire, sookie.
so are you.
and yet parts of your former self are still in there, right?
I wouldn't be with you if they weren't.
Yes.
but I've had to work extremely hard at finding my way back to my humanity.
fragile as it may be.
when a vampire's as new as jessica is, she has no humanity.
she's in the grips of an overwhelming number of transformations.
there will be times when she cannot control even a single impulse.
believe me, she has many.
how is that any different from being a teenage girl?
no humanity, check.
in the grips of overwhelming transformations, check.
cannot control impulses, check.
all right, uh, how is that different?
all right, so, what do you suggest I do?
just spoil the girl?
give in to her every whim and desire?
after all, that is what every teenage girl wants, isn't it?
you don't have to be sarcastic with me, bill compton.
and you should at least think about what I'm saying, if for no other reason than what you're doing right now isn't working out so hot.
kind of ironic.
we promised each other we weren't gonna fight anymore, and yet here we are.
this isn't a fight.
Yes, it is.
well, then...
prepare to be made up to.
this is a disaster.
we'll have to go much shorter than I planned.
Yeah, well, I said I was sorry, pam.
but he took silver to me.
you were there. You saw it. Defend me.
I don't know what it is you wanna know, but point me in the direction, and I give to you.
I've seen your website. It's quite, um, low rent.
but your clients miss you, lafayette.
they're wondering if you're ever coming back.
am I?
look, I'm here because of the v, right?
how about I give you the names of everybody I ever sold to?
and all this time I thought prostitutes were good at keeping secrets.
Oh, don't get it twisted, honeycomb, I'm a survivor first, a capitalist second, and a whole bunch of other shit after that.
but a hooker, dead last.
so if I got even a jew at an al qaeda pep rally shot at getting my black ass up out this motherfucker, I'm taking it.
now, what you wanna know?
the vampire you had your little arrangement with.
what happened to him?
um, I don't...I don't know.
I swear to god I don't.
last time I saw him he was doing real good.
but I...I think he may have been taken by somebody.
by whom?
I don't know. I...I mean I ain't sure.
well, that's not very forthcoming of you.
Chow, you're up.
no, no, chill out.
shit.
I...I think it...I think it was jason stackhouse.
Sookie's brother. Could be fun?
fun, yes. But also stupid.
Sookie is too important to us.
that is true.
sadly, this information is of no use to me.
not now, anyway.
I understand dealers of vampire blood sometimes trade product with one another across state lines.
any buyers in the dallas area?
Yes.
one.
he never gave me his name though.
I have an e-mail address.
a friend of mine in the dallas area, his name is godrick, has gone missing.
now, while the circumstances of his disappearance are unclear, it stands to reason his blood would be very valuable, as he's over twice my age and ten times the vampire I will ever be.
Oh, eric, you don't do humble well.
I was not being humble. This happens to be true.
your associate, this "pussylover."
has he or she mentioned any new product coming on the market?
no.
no.
and I would tell you.
you... you know that.
Chowtake our guest and lock him back out, will you?
fuck that, I ain't going back down there.
I gave you... you gave me nothing!
I'm not going back.
Chow, now.
No! No!
I gave you every... I gave you everything!
I ain't going back down!
Luke mcdonald.
no relation to the restaurant.
okay.
any relation to the farm?
what farm?
Ah, never mind.
Jason stackhouse. Nice to meet you.
you play ball?
Oh, uh, yeah.
what position?
QB one, actually.
tight end.
second team all-American.
I don't doubt it, man.
look at you.
you'd make one hell of a target.
I'd have locked onto you.
you would have.
blew my knee out. Freshman year at college. Texas a&M.
you had the scholarship and everything?
everything happens for a reason.
if it weren't for my knee, I'd have never found my true calling.
and it might have taken me three solid years of bible study and abstinence and applying and reapplying to do it, but it was all worth it.
it all led me to this moment, right here, getting on this here bus.
how about you?
When'd you set your heart on going to leadership conference?
two days ago.
two days ago.
well, I didn't know about it till then.
see, I was having breakfast with steve and sarah, and they asked me if I wanted to come.
you had breakfast with steve and sarah?
Yeah.
what?
I'll tell you what.
with luck like yours, maybe some of it will rub off on me.
you want...? You wanna bunk together?
shit, yeah.
don't-- don't say "shit."
shit? Oh, no.
it's okay. -Right.
it's okay. Forgive yourself.
let's sing.
I was wondering when you would wake up.
come here.
what?
you smell nasty and nice, all at the same time.
okay.
so, um, as I was trying to sleep last night, I realized I don't know that much about you.
and I'd kind of like to, or...
when it comes to men, I've got a long history of putting the cart so far out in front that the horse can't see it.
so now I'm just trying to get it right.
you like me, Tarno, I know you do.
of course I like you.
take a shower in your sweat, if I could.
okay.
I mean, we've known each other for what now, couple weeks?
I mean, people usually take years unloading their baggage, so I'm just trying to figure out what's the rush?
the rush is I was just curious.
now I see how bad you want to avoid it, I ain't just curious anymore.
I'm worried.
okay.
I don't have a job.
I already figured that out.
get to the good stuff.
okay, um...
the day we met, remember I told you I was worse off than you when maryann found me?
well, the truth is I was, um, living under a freeway overpass without a penny in my pocket.
and that's a penny I still don't have today, by the way.
I don't care about money.
I've spent some time in prison.
what for?
drugs.
possession or dealing?
I gotta pick one?
okay.
colorful.
and I also served some time for armed robbery and assault.
but I got out early on the assault charge for good behavior, so that's a plus.
Yeah, you oughta know.
our own mary simmons spoke to the parents at their home in shreveport earlier today.
if anyone has seen our daughter, or even if you're the person who took her, she's our first-born.
and she's a goodhearted, smart girl who's never done anything to harm anybody.
so please just bring her home.
we just want to see our baby again.
another harrowing appeal from young jessica hamby's mother...
and so it is with open arms that Steve and I welcome all of you to the light of day leadership conference.
tomorrow's leaders today.
Amanda will be coming around with your ring of honesty.
your ring symbolizes the promise...
welcome.
thank you. -To us...And to yourselves.
that you will always be completely honest and open while here on this campus.
also, bear in mind, that your ring is made out of real silver.
so protect it with all your heart.
and maybe one day, your ring will protect you.
die, fangers!
now, some of you already have friends here, but most of you probably don't.
and this is nothing to worry about.
because you will all be fast friends, as you all have one thing in common.
because for every one of you, today is the day hiholy light begins to shine on you.
heh! Amen.
Amen, brother!
whoopy daisy.
you'll get the hang of it.
Ugh, sure.
you're late.
tara: Sorry.
how about me?
am I on time?
I'm gonna go punch you in.
I was in and out of here so fast last night I barely got a look at the place.
it's, um... it's so, um...
vibrant.
well, thanks for your concern, but, uh, there's a big rodeo on monroe today.
so that's why we slow.
well, tara says the food here is wonderful, so let's see what I'm in the mood for.
it's my first table. -I got this one.
Oh, are you sure?
Uh-huh, you just... you just focus on one thing at a time.
stop fucking with me.
tableside visit from the owner himself.
I must be important.
I want you to leave.
you're not really gonna refuse me service, are you?
I mean after I forgave you a hundred thousand dollar loan, the least you could do is let me buy myself some lunch.
what can I get you?
I think I will go with the stuffed snapper with the crawfish topping, the blackened rib eye, the red beans and rice, the ooh, the fried catfish, and, uh, oh, dear, now, would it be possible to get the smothered pork chops for lunch,
now, how are your...
that's how you capture the flag.
boom!
capture that.
all right, show us your muscles.
I wanna see the flag you captured.
here comes stackhouse. He's back.
I see you. -Nice hair.
that's what I'm talking about right there.
Sookie, what are you doing here?
I thought it was your day off.
it is.
how many times do I have to tell you that coming in to work when you don't have to is pathetic?
it's like going back to school and visiting your teachers.
I didn't come to see my teachers. I came to see you.
so come on.
take a break.
Sam will be pissed.
he's always pissed.
I'm... I'm losing it, sam.
Terry, come on. What is this?
it ain't my fault.
how the hell am I supposed to read her writing?
motherfucker.
so, basically, you're like a stepmother to a vampire?
okay, you did not just call me that.
what about you? How've you been?
Oh, sook.
I'm confused.
about what?
you know I've been living over at maryann's for the last couple weeks?
I do.
well, in a lot of ways, I don't ever wanna leave.
I mean, everything is taken care of for me there.
my bed gets made, my laundry gets done, there's breakfast on the patio served to you by a chef.
can I move in?
seriously, right?
but it scares me too.
and maybe that's just cause I'm not used to taking and not giving, but something inside me says, "this is weird, Tara."
don't trust it.
what do you think?
does all this sound too good to be true to you?
I think before I answer that, I have to tell you I may have a conflict of interest in all this.
conflict of interest?
Yeah. See, the main reason I came to see you today was...tara thornton, would you like to move in with me?
heh, really?
are you serious?
of course I'm serious.
it would be so much fun.
and we know we get along.
when we were kids, you slept over more often than you didn't, and we never wanted to pull each other's hair out or anything.
that's where you're wrong.
I was always jealous of your long blond hair.
more than once I thought about cutting it while you slept.
you did not.
Oh, yes, I did.
so...?
so, what do you think?
cause I've been trying to get my act together, to move into gran's room for the past couple weeks, and your moving in might be the kick in the but I need to do it.
Sam: Oh, daphne!
that's right on my feet.
how am I supposed to ignore that?
I'm sorry.
if you wanna make it to bill's tonight, you better get out of here before sam asks you to stay.
you're probably right.
tara: Hi, sam.
Bye, sam.
is this the infamous sookie?
Sookie, maryann.
Maryann, sookie.
it's nice to meet you.
Oh, likewise.
well, you're very special, you know.
I mean, to have been through everything you have in your life, not to mention the last few weeks and to emerge through all of it walking, let alone smiling, it's... well, it's simply astonishing.
I see what you mean about her, tara.
she has an old soul, doesn't she?
Oh, sorry.
I'm usually good at placing people's accents, but yours I can't get a handle on.
where are you from?
cape cod.
best potato chips in the world.
well, I'd love to stay and chat, but I'm running late.
Tara, let me know what you decide about moving in, all right?
cause I think it'd be really great.
she asked you to move in with her?
that was awfully nice.
Yeah, but I...I don't know what I'm doing, so
who the fuck are you?
Oh, shit.
well?
it's daytime.
thank you, jesus.
thank you, god. You're human, right?
kind of.
but I ain't letting you go.
if that's what you're thinking.
look at you.
not only is you sexy, mmm, but you can read minds too.
that getting me all riled up in my nether regions.
don't you try and flirt with me.
they told me to pay special attention to the faggot drag queen in the basement.
Oh, skank ass bitch, you gonna let me up outta here!
I do that, I'm good as dead.
and you know it.
don't you move.
you ain't gonna shoot me, not with them shaky-ass hands.
you ain't got the stomach for it.
bitch.
holy fucker.
I'm sorry.
I'm so fucking sorry.
I hate guns!
I'm the one who got shot.
will you quit screaming and go get me a doc before I bleed the fuck out?
okay.
hurry up.
motherfucker.
these are all dirty.
just give me the fucking towel.
thank you, everybody. Honesty.
honesty, babe!
let's hear it again for our very own amanda james!
you did very good, honey.
that was "jesus asked me out today," and it's on her new album, which drops next tuesday, is that right?
Yes.
uh, look for it at wal-mart, target, cosco, and, of course, the single's already available for download on itunes.
so check it out.
thank you. Thank you.
boy: I love you, amanda!
you hate to have to follow that.
go on, go on, sit down.
all right, now, uh, finally tonight, we're gonna wind things down with a little game, which, while fun, should also be instructive.
because as each of you heads out into the world, at some point, you will be faced with real life encounters with vampire sympathizers.
and we want to make sure that you're ready.
so, sarah, honey, can you come on up here, please?
now, I'm gonna ask my beautiful bride to play the part of a sympathizer.
Oh, come on, y'all, it's just pretend.
and...
why don't you come on up and play the part of the good guy?
me?
well you captured the flag, didn't you?
boy 1: Yeah, stackhouse!
boy 2: You the man, jason!
boy 3: Go, shreve, go!
Hello?
I just saw my parents on tv.
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
I finally get why they never wanted me to watch it in the first place.
it's horrible.
Where's bill?
I have no idea.
all he told me was,"jessica, I have errands to run."
errands which do not require your presence.
so remain here and do your best to stay out of trouble while I'm gone.
and I hate it here.
I hate it so much.
I, um...
I think I miss them.
your parents?
and my little sister.
I was always totally horrible to her.
I was just such a brat， hey, what's wrong with me?
sweetie, vampires don't cry regular tears.
so when you cry, you're gonna cry blood from now on.
well, why do you know that and I don't?
I mean, don't you think I should know this about myself?
bill should probably have told you.
jeez, you think?
here's some tissue.
look, I don't know if it helps at all, but I think I kind of know how you feel.
at least a little.
no, you don't.
I'm not saying it's the same, but I lost my grandma a few weeks ago, and she was everything to me.
everything I knew, and now she's gone.
but grandparents are supposed to die, and you're still alive.
I mean, with me, I'm the one that's dead.
it doesn't really matter who's dead.
when people love each other, and then suddenly one of them isn't there anymore, it's the distance that hurts.
and the distance is the same no matter who's doing the leaving.
what do you do when you feelso far away you can't stand it?
well, sometimes I'll go into her room and just sit there a spell.
that helps?
I don't know why, but just being someplace where she's been, it makes me feel better, at least a little bit.
you think maybe you could drive me to my parents' so that I could -
okay, I did not mean to... you know I can't do that.
please. I...I would just sit in the car. I...I swear.
all I'm asking is to sit across the street and catch a glimpse of them through the window.
just so I can say goodbye.
I'm sorry.
it's just not my place.
but if you explained it to bill the same way you just explained it to me,
I'm sure he'd take you.
are you really sure about that?
cause I'm not so sure he would.
okay.
Really?
Yes.
but we're just driving by and that's it.
and we should swing by my place first and get you a change of clothes, because I am not taking you out in public dressed like tha well, thank you, sookie. Thank you so, so, much.
Oh, don't mention it.
to bill.
ever.
woman: I like this one best.
man: Fine, go try it on.
you look positively lost.
Yes, I do feel a little...at sea.
I can help you pick something out if you'd like.
you're looking for your daughter?
Yes.
my daughter, jessica.
mm, such a pretty name.
what do you think of this?
it's very nice, but I don't think so.
Mmm, my, we are conservative, aren't we?
no, not really.
just old-fashioned.
don't be silly.
you don't look old enough to be old-fashioned.
not by a long shot.
you'd be surprised.
you're funny.
and cold.
well, you're not- I am vampire.
Yes.
tell you what.
why don't you come with me to the dressing room and I could model this for you?
that's very kind of you, but no thank you.
you sure, now?
I am.
good evening, old sport.
it's the new me.
you like?
I do.
very much.
okay.
we need to talk.
listen, lady, if you're gonna give them all the rights that normal people have, then how am I supposed to protect my sweet little girl from any vampire who wants to just fly on in and marry her?
you have a daughter?
well, ahem, I was a pretty bad boy up until the light of day leadership conference.
so yeah.
it's entirely possible that I could.
well, I don't give a hoot about your daughter.
in fact, nothing you say about vampire rights is gonna change my mind.
because...
I am a vampire.
I'm so sorry.
it's okay.
you all right?
it's okay.
you all right?
Yeah.
I got another deluxe, I can't guarantee that it's cooked.
Oh, honey, you are sweating like a ice-water pitcher.
I'm feeling the pressure, arlene.
I don't like feeling the pressure.
well, use your last break.
I ain't taking one.
I'm coming around there.
Daphne! Order up!
fucking
give me your tongs. -I'm fine.
give me your tongs.
taking a break.
be a doll, take that out to table four for me.
okay.
which one's table four again?
well, I'll find it.
I'll find it.
she ain't working out.
Nope.
it's funny.
most of these orders are going out to table four.
what the hell's going on at table four?
miss! Miss?
I think you're looking for me.
I'd have stood there all night if you hadn't noticed me.
so, thanks.
are you new here?
how could you tell?
because you care about doing a good job.
now you just keep on caring and one day you'll be the best at what you do.
that's my advice.
don't you think you've had enough?
I know what you're thinking.
nine years sober.
why give it all up?
well, what I got to say to that is: Why the hell not?
lots of people in this town don't need to see you this way.
the people in this town don't see me.
not for what I really am.
well, how about you quit feeling sorry for yourself and suck it up?
you want respect from people, start by respecting yourself.
bud took me off a case, sam.
I don't know about you, but in my book that's a capital demotion.
Ah, hey I'm sorry, I didn't know that.
I'll get back on the right path tomorrow but tonight I just... don't cut me off, all right?
no problem.
things are ?
that was the place where you could come, get a drink, nobody would bother you to dance.
I am with you there.
I hate to dance.
this one time, I was in a club in shreveport, and I actually had a woman tell me I looked like a epileptic on meth.
never again, sam.
never again.
the sheriff of area 9 in Texas has gone missing.
have you heard about that?
I hadn't, but I know the vampire of whom we speak.
his name is godrick, correct? -Indeed.
now it goes without saying he needs to be found.
which is where sookie comes in.
no.
as she's yours, I'm asking your permission to take her with me to dallas.
Eric, you can do whatever you want with me, but I am not putting her in this position anymore.
I cannot and I will not allow you to bring her into these matters.
we made a deal, your human and I.
that if I didn't kill anyone, she would work for me as often as I like.
now, you remember this, don't you?
you were there.
taking her cross state lines is a far cry from taking her to Fangtasia for the evening.
I'm only asking your permission out of respect.
if I want her, I can simply take her.
is "no" your final answer?
it is.
poorly played, bill.
here, this is it.
across the street.
my daddy won't be home yet, but my mama and sister should be there.
yeah?
I'm sorry.
well, why are you crying?
because I did this to you.
if bill hadn't...
I took your life away, and I know there's no way you'll ever be able to forgive me it'sot n even right to ask.
but I had no idea it was gonna lead to this.
I don't blame you, Sookie.
how's that even possible?
there's my sister.
get back in the car!
Hello?
you promised.
fault: Front door.
mom?
don't cry.
Oh, hey, Eden.
where were you?
it doesn't matter.
just call your father.
and-- and tell him that jessica's home.
uh, uh, momma, I'd like to introduce you to my friend.
this is sookie.
Hello, sookie.
thank you.
thank you so much for bringing her back.
you're welcome.
aren't you gonna invite us in?
what? No, no.
we can't stay.
honey, your arm's like ice.
come on in and I'll make you some tea.
come on.
what just walked through that door?
tara: Trouble.
Hey, tara.
eggs, I'm working.
I know. I'm sorry.
I got something to say, and I want you to hear me out, all right?
I'll hear you out.
you are a crazy-ass drunk, but normally you wait for some loser to hit on you.
what the hell has gotten into you?
I... I don't know.
okay.
what?
eggs: All right. Listen.
my dad left us when I was a little kid.
so I don't remember shit about him except this:
he used to always say,"you can't get what you want in life, so in order to get it you're prepared not to want it."
well, I say fuck that.
I wanna be with u, tara, and I refuse to pretend I don'T.
detective bellefleur, you come dance with me.
I don't dance.
with me you do. Come on! Come on!
what the hell!
it's my last night drinking.
think you walk on water, don't you?
I'm pretty sure that was moses.
no, it was jesus.
moses parted the red sea.
and what the hell was the deal with you snapping the american flag in half like you some muslim buffy with a dick?
that's all kinds of messed up.
well, I'm sorry you didn't like it, mac, but everyone else -
your being here is a joke, stackhouse.
they may not see it now, but they will.
day one might have went to you.
day two belongs to the luke-inator.
voice 1: Die, fanger!
voice 2: Jason stackhouse, you're a tool of satan.
he probably tripled it.
voice 3: Traitor.
just drink.
they may not see it now, but they will.
the fuck is going on out there?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the dancing and the gyrating and the people nearly having sex on the pool table?
I don't know what to tell you.
people came back from the rodeo in a good mood.
damn it, maryann, this is my bar, these are my people.
this is my town!
don't do that.
I've seen you do that before.
stop it.
abracadabra, sam.
what I just did to you, I can do anytime, anywhere.
so unless you want your customers to know your little secret, you better think twice before you threaten me ever again.
do we understand each other?
I don't normally cuss, but you have completely fucked me.
I know and I'm sorry, but I swear it was like it wasn't even me doing it.
it must be those new vampire impulse control issues.
fuck your impulse control issues.
here's some sandwiches.
mom's still making tea.
Oh, thanks, eden.
thank you.
mother: You already had dinner.
don't touch those sandwiches.
you're pretty.
wow, that's awful nice of you.
and you're very pretty yourself.
no.
I'm not.
got a problem with hair.
recorded voice: Fault: Front door.
how could you do this?
daddy.
do you have any idea what you put your mother through?
why, jessica?
you tell me why?
Mr. Hamby!
or I will make you tell me!
go ahead, daddy.
get your belt.
but this time, I'll be ready for you.
how much blood do you think he's lost?
Oh, I still think he has something to offer.
I hate to let it all go to waste like this.
it seems a shame we have to wait for eric.
Yeah, maybe one day you'll be sheriff and you can make the rules.
I doubt that.
me too.
sorry to keep you waiting for so long.
how's the leg?
shitty.
thanks for asking.
after all your proclamations about what a model prisoner you were going to be, you had to try to escape.
you were going to kill me anyway, right?
well, now you'll never know.
so, what's it gonna be, lafayette?
would you like the leg to kill you, or would you prefer us to do it?
I'm gonna go with plan C.
there's a plan c?
make me a vampire.
I beg your pardon?
and you can put me to work in the bar.
I'm a good dancer.
you seen it on my site.
shit, I get up there and move earth and heaven, go style.
you are aware there's a gaping hole in your leg?
you're damaged goods.
not if you turn me.
I'll be good as ever.
look, I'm already a person of poor moral character, so I'll hit the ground running.
and I damn near glamour people already.
give me what y'all got, and it's on me, cracker.
not only will I be a badass vampire, but I'll be your badass vampire.
interesting.
yeah?
I'll take it under advisement.
chowtime.
how could you let some bloodsucker bite you like that?
Mr. Hamby! -I didn't let anybody do anything me.
but, oh, am I glad he did.
cause now I get to homeschool you in what it's like to be scared.
stop! Jesus christ, sookie.
would you shut the fuck up?
you okay?
baby, please.
this isn't you.
you don't know the first thing about me.
you're too dumb to know anything.
Oh, what?
she is dumb.
she's dumber than a sack full of hammers, and he's as mean as a snake.
and that's the way it's always gonna be around here.
so I am ending it.
right here, right now.
and I am doing it with your belt.
daddy?
it's okay, baby.
don't worry.
this will only hurt for a minute.
Jessica, let him go.
but... as your maker I command you.
mother: God help us.
thank god you're here.
shut up.
now, someone who lives here must invite me in.
no. No, don't, he's one of them.
he'll kill us all.
Sookie: He won'T. He's not like that.
you.
little girl.
come here.
come back here! -Eden, don't.
good girl.
now, you listen to me.
I'm here to protect you.
you and your mother and your father.
I am your friend.
so you just invite me in and I can make everything stop.
you can?
Yes.
won't you please come in, sir?
I'm sorry.
get the hell outta here.
now, so I can clean up your mess.
please don't kill them.
this is your fault.
now get the hell outta here.
bill, slow down, please.
stop this. You're scaring me.
I'm sorry.
she promised she was just gonna look in the window.
I know I made a mistake, but they're her family.
she is a vampire. She has no family.
I'm a monster and I'm gonna be alone forever because of you.
I hate you so fucking much.
be quiet. - Eat shit.
I said, be quiet!
you undermined my authority as her maker.
you risked those peoples' safety and your own.
if I had not glamoured them within an inch of their sanity, our lives would have been shattered.
I know. I'm sorry.
you keep saying that! And I am expected to what?
forget this ever happened?
what else would you like me to say?
I knew when she asked me to take her I should say no, but all I could think about was gran and what I'd give to see her again.
that does not give you license to behave like an irresponsible child.
she is a loaded gun, Sookie.
not a doll for you to dress up and play with.
what are you doing? - Walking!
don't be ridiculous. Bon temps is nearly 20 miles away.
I'd rather walk all night than spend another second in that car with you.
Oh, she wants you to go after her.
and she wants you to go after her and kiss her and tell her that you love her.
she will come back.
when she calms down she will come back.
bill, if you're trying to scare me so I get back into that car with you, it isn't gonna work.
what did this to you?
bull-- human-- I couldn't see
bill, I can't move.
Oh, gross.
get the car, now!
drive straight home.
but I wanna go with you.
as your maker, I command you.
yeah?
I'm short.
I went over it three times. I- I don't know what happened
how much?
Sixty-four dollars and, like, eight cents.
God damn it, Daphne, you're gonna have to pay for it.
I'm sorry, but this is business.
there.
that's all the tips that I made tonight, so I'm just gonna have to owe you the rest.
fuck.
you can't expect her to learn if you don't give her any positive reinforcement.
Tara, not now. - I'm serious.
nobody succeeds at anything in life unless somebody leads them.
let me guess. Maryann say that?
what is it with you and Maryann?
what's she ever done to you, other than just drop almost $300 in your bar tonight?
I don't want her in here anymore.
and if I were you, I'd stay the hell away from her.
you don't even know this person.
neither do you.
what kind of doctor are you?
the healing kind.
I'm doctor Ludwig, what's your
Sookie-- Miss Sookie Stackhouse.
am I dying?
Yes.
no. She cannot die.
you will save her.
back off, vampire, let me do my job.
Eric: Forgive him. Bill is abnormally attached to this human.
well, we don't have a lot of choices, she's been poisoned.
you ever heard of Komodo dragons?
their mouths are teeming with bacteria.
after one has bitten you, it will track you for hours, days, just waiting for the toxins to slowly eat away at your nervous system till you're good and helpless.
then it will devour you alive.
I was scratched by a dragon?
no, but this poison is similar but way more efficient.
I think I've seen it before, but it's hard to tell without testing, and we don't have that kind of time.
give us some privacy. I need to remove her clothing.
I will be just outside.
I am so sorry.
she's running out of time, Mr. Compton.
head of a bull.
that's what she said.
it was dark.
it all happened in seconds.
so you didn't see this, uh, bull man, huh?
no.
and you gave her your blood?
it didn't work.
you ever heard of anything like this?
surprisingly, no.
I thought in over a thousand years I'd seen everything there was to see.
search the woods around Highway 71.
he can do it. I'm wearing my favorite pumps.
she is extremely lazy.
but loyal.
how's yours?
Jessica, huh? - Petulant. Dangerous.
afraid.
I'm glad to see you two are bonding.
being a good maker is very rewarding.
I have to get back to Sookie.
Oh, relax.
Dr. Ludwig treated one of Pam's humans when it was mauled by a werewolf.
lost an eye, but otherwise he's fine.
what are you doing to her?
hold her down!
or let her die, your choice.
man: You're so warm.
and I'm so cold.
Eddie. What are you doing here, Jason?
I thought we were friends.
you're fucking dead.
I saw you die.
this ain't real. This ain't real.
does this feel real?
dear god, you gotta help me out, because, uh, I don't know what's right and wrong no more.
maybe I never did.
just-- god, please.
please. Give me another sign.
because...
I'm lost.
I'm so fucking lost.
there's your sign.
now, shut up. Someone's trying to sleep in here.
you can give her blood now. Her body should accept it.
mine is much stronger, allow me.
never.
Sookie, can you hear me? You must drink.
I'll expect my payment by the end of the week.
it's always a pleasure doing business with you, Dr. Ludwig.
Ludwig: Fuck off.
clearly the pleasure was one-sided.
well, she's no fan of the fang.
she tolerates us, because our blood is of such great value to healers.
be careful. You'll overcook her.
all right.
thank you.
the area has been scanned.
tracks were human, but the smell was distinctly animal.
what kind? - A filthy one.
we didn't recognize it.
Eric: How intriguing. Send an alert through the appropriate channels.
find out what the neighbors know.
and Pam.
those were great pumps.
I don't wanna move her.
of course not.
I'll make sure she's taken care of.
I'm not leaving her.
Longshadow kept a coffin in back.
he liked to feed before resting, so it might be a bit messy, but you're welcome to it.
I wanna thank you for your hospitality.
and for saving Sookie's life.
I'm sure there's a way she can repay me.
that's delicious, Karl.
could use a little more juniper, don't you think?
Yes, yes, of course. You're right.
what's all this?
Oh, I'm having a few people over.
how many people?
you know, I don't remember.
sit. Karl will make you some breakfast.
that's okay. I'm more of a breakfast-for-lunch kind of girl.
but coffee's great.
Thanks, Karl.
I don't think I'll ever get used to people just doing things for me without me even asking.
well, Karl knows that if he wants to find real fulfillment in life, he need to learn to be of service, so everything he does for us is really a selfish act.
Maryann, why does Sam hate you?
Sam hates me?
practically jumped down my throat after you left last night.
kept saying I need to stay away from you, why would he say that?
well...
I mean, I barely know the man, but if I had to guess, I'd say jealousy.
you two have a history.
Yeah, but we're better as friends than we ever were at sleeping together.
we both know that.
still not valuing yourself.
you are a fantastic woman.
Sam lost you.
he's just looking for someone to blame.
but why you?
because you've moved on.
and hopefully I've been a part of making that happen.
Sam seems like a sensitive, wonderful guy, but all my instincts scream, "unevolved" .
you're right. That man has way too many issues.
and they are not your problem.
unlike Karl, you've done enough taking care of people to last a lifetime.
holy shit, that's beautiful.
it's even got a filter?
little technique I picked up in Ibiza.
adorable, isn't it?
Oh, fuck it. I don't have to be at work till 4: 00.
Hey, Terry.
thanks for coming.
taking a trip?
something like that.
where to?
not sure yet.
well, I ain't been a lot of places, but better here than all the places I've been.
Hey, so listen, I was hoping you'd take care of the bar for me.
you know, just till I get back.
yeah...
I-I don't know, Sam.
I like cooking.
it's quiet back there and...
I ain't so good with people.
if I were you, I wouldn't be my first choice.
well, actually, you're not.
I can't reach Sookie.
and who knows where the hell Lafayette is, Arlene's got enough on her plate, - and Tara-- - don't like feeling the pressure.
Tara's-- she's going through some personal stuff right now.
so you're all I got.
you do it for me, buddy?
well, I guess I ain't got no choice.
I appreciate it.
appreciate it, I'll get you a set of keys after closing.
so you're just gonna cut and run.
just like that.
I'm not running.
remind me never to get stuck in a foxhole with you.
coward.
he used me up.
till he got bored.
and then he left me to die.
I thought he loved me, but I was nothing, but his living, breathing, snack machine.
thank you for sharing your story, missy.
that was very brave.
may his holy light shine on you.
all: Praise the light. - Praise...light.
woman: Jason? Is there something you'd like to share?
n-no, thank you.
I ain't much of a sharing kind of guy.
remember, we all signed a vow of honesty.
are you wearing your honesty ring?
Yeah.
all right, but, uh, you ain't gonna like it.
pretty much goes against everything y'all been saying.
you're safe here.
I ain't a vampire victim.
the fact is they have never done nothing against me.
my sister's dating one, and from everything I can tell, he seems to treat her pretty decent.
well, except for the biting, but I think she likes that.
Oh, no, please. - What?
go on.
my girlfriend, she staked a vampire right in front of me.
his name was Eddie, and he was gay, but he- he was a real nice person.
he wasn't a person, Jason.
a person wouldn't do that.
would they?
well, my gran and my girlfriend were killed by my best friend just because he had a problem with vampires.
and he was a person.
look, I'm only here because I thought god wanted me to be.
thought maybe he had a purpose for me.
some shit like that.
beginning to see that was just wishful thinking.
no, Jason, wait.
Becky, take over for a second.
sure.
let's pray.
Hey, Jason. Just talk to me.
there ain't nothing to talk about.
the first time I laid eyes on you, I knew there was something special about this one.
I knew the lord had sent you to me, but it wasn't till today that I knew why.
Why?
because we're so much alike.
no, but-- we wanna see the best in others so badly, that sometimes we overlook the worst.
that kind of does sound like me.
when the vampires came out of the coffin,
I went with my big sister Amber to march for their equal rights.
Really?
two months later, Amber disappeared.
got hooked on V.
I know they killed her.
got rid of her body in whatever way they do.
I'm sorry.
they stole my sister, Jason.
the same way they stole your girlfriend and your grandmother.
I know you believe Eddie was your friend, but think about it.
if his kind never existed, the people you love would still be alive.
you're saying...
if I hadn't been too messed up to protect them, that they'd still be here?
no, you're just human, but vampires-- everything they are, down to their very blood, is seductive.
God.
I should have done something.
could have saved gran, Amy...
all of them.
I know how much it hurts.
trust me, that's why-- if we can protect even one family from this kind of suffering, then all the loved ones we've lost, their deaths won't have been for nothing.
you know, sometimes...
I wish I was dead too.
but you're not.
God needs you.
no. No.
you don't have to carry this alone anymore.
give yourself to His light.
let him carry this pain for you.
pray with me?
okay.
heavenly father, bless Jason, and protect his sister, and all those who are still out there lost in the darkness.
Ginger: You're awake.
I made you a two-top sandwich.
peanut butter and chocolate syrup.
that's very thoughtful, Ginger.
Oh, that's the thing about being with vamps, ain't it?
you always forget to eat.
I've lost 37 pounds since I got this job.
way better than a fat farm.
did Bill leave?
Oh, he's resting in back, I think.
do they make you stay here every day?
well, sometimes I just come in for deliveries, but these days I've been coming in for-- heh.
never mind all that.
you just finish up your sandwich and go back to sleep.
Ginger: Oh, my god, I almost told her about her friend Lafayette in the basement.
Eric says I can't tell her.
why would Eric have Lafayette in the basement?
I just work here.
Ginger: Please don't make me use that gun under the cash register.
take me to him!
now!
Oh, my god.
is that really you?
what have they done to you?
do I look like a vampire?
you look awful.
I feel fucking worse.
I guess that means I ain't a vampire then, which is good.
uncuff him.
I don't have that key.
I swear.
Ginger: Eric's gonna be so mad at me.
Jesus have mercy.
I'm gonna get you outta here.
I promise.
that's a new song?
Yeah.
I didn't get serious about this till recently, so I got a lot to learn.
sounding pretty good to me.
nice, I just, you know, I love music,
I just wasted most of my life trying to avoid doing the shit I love the most.
Why?
I-I-I guess I just felt like, um
if I was good at something, it's probably just a waste of time, and if it felt good I probably didn't deserve it.
you know, um, a couple days after, um, Maryann took me in, she put this guitar in my hands, and I cried like a fucking baby.
was the first time in my life anybody's actually ever encouraged me to do anything.
so...
I'm sorry. I
don't apologize.
only thing my mama ever encouraged me how to learn was how to pour whisky.
Oh, fuck me.
what?
I was supposed to be at work 45 minutes ago.
I can give you a ride, now.
how many of those have you had?
four?
I think one dui between us is enough, don't you?
besides, I am way too fucked up to deal with Sam Merlotte right now.
well, is he gonna fire you?
maybe, but it's just a job.
and I go through those about as fast as I go through relationships.
maybe you haven't found the right one yet.
I've had a lot of jobs.
I ain't talking about that shit.
you still angry about our fight?
Sookie, none of that matters anymore.
you're right.
I'm alive and in one piece, unlike my friend Lafayette who Eric chained up like an animal - and left to bleed to death. - What?
you better not have known anything about this, Bill Compton, because if you did,
I don't think I could ever forgive you.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
she's referring to the human in my basement.
the human that traded sexual services with a vampire in order to sell his blood.
which, as you know, is a grave offense.
his name is Lafayette and you ought to be ashamed of yourself for what you've done to him.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
and may I add, that color suits you very well.
go to hell. - Sookie, enough.
Oh, it's not nearly enough.
they've tortured him and bitten him and shot him and kept him down there in his own filth for weeks.
is this true?
there are others who would have done far worse and you know it.
you're gonna let him go right now, or I swear, I'm going to the police.
I do not respond well to threats.
but perhaps we can come to some sort of arrangement.
please.
Hey, Tara.
so I guess you're not coming in tonight.
I get it.
you're pissed at me for what I said about Maryann.
look.
Tara, I know you're smart and you're tough, and you can take care of yourself, and that's all I'm asking you to do.
okay? Just keep your eyes open.
and take a good look at the people around you.
and be careful, okay? Just be careful.
I know. I know I'm late, I'm sorry, but Lisa decided to give Coby a nose piercing.
like she saw on America's next top model.
well, now he's got an infection
it's okay, Arlene. Just go ahead and get changed.
uh, is everything all right with you, Sam? - Yeah.
Yeah, everything's fine.
I thought, uh, Sookie's supposed to be working tonight.
she was. She called and asked me to cover for her.
lord knows I owe her one after-- you know.
nice and understanding looks good on you, Sam.
Hello?
anybody home?
Hi.
Hi.
you mind if I join you?
I-- uh-- I mean, if you're alone.
I'm alone.
Hi, I'm Hoyt.
so this might sound kind of funny, but I was just sitting there, thinking, "how come you don't ever meet a nice girl," Hoyt?
and then you just walked right in.
how do you know I'm a nice girl?
because of your smile, I guess.
you can tell a lot about someone by the way they smile, and, uh, you know, I watch people all the time.
you see, oh, like that.
that's beautiful.
I could just-- I could stare at that all day long.
day? Yeah, right.
did I say something wrong?
no.
course not.
okay. Okay, good, because I-- I don't wanna scare you away-- would you like a drink or someth-- or-- or food?
you hungry?
you should try the chicken fried steak, because it's, uh, oh, it's like a chicken and a steak got together and made a baby.
it's delicious.
crispy, baby, and um...
I'll just have a bottle of true blood.
b positive.
you're a vampire?
for real?
Wow.
wow, that is awesome.
a- a bottle of true blood.
coming right up.
so if I agree to go to Dallas to help look for this missing vampire, you'll let Lafayette go?
you nearly died last night.
you are not going to Dallas.
bill, I can make up my own mind.
I'll pay all of your expenses, of course, and yes, I will release your friend.
and I want $5000.
I've missed a lot of work and I need a driveway.
your human is getting cocky.
she will take $10, 000 and I will escort her.
I don't think so, no. -Yes.
ten thousand and Bill comes with me or it's a deal breaker.
you surprise me.
and that is a rare quality in a breather.
you disgust me.
perhaps I'll grow on you.
I'd prefer cancer.
you need to leave immediately.
I will make the travel arrangements, but I will need your credit card number.
such a shame.
I was hoping I could convince Eric to let me keep you.
no, you already have enough pets.
no offense, but you ain't exactly my type, bitch.
can I kick him?
you can try.
enough. Have Chow fetch their car.
I'll see you around, I'm sure.
Oh, don't bet on it, baby.
I'm retiring.
I'm done with you crazy-ass fuckers.
done.
right when I thought this party couldn't get any fucking weirder, look who shows up.
thinking Andy Bellefleur got better shit to do, like, I dunno, solve a murder.
well, you know what they say about all work and no play.
seems like you're pretty familiar with the idea.
it was your fault I missed work in the first place.
you're just too damn distracting.
Mike Spencer. - Howdy, Andy.
great party, huh?
less talking. More dancing!
jade Bokowsi, you are one fiery little hellcat.
what you doing in here, pig?
detective Bellefleur?
I'm so glad you made it.
actually, I'm here because there have been some complaints about the noise.
and they sent their best detective to deal with it?
well, I am flattered.
but sheriff Dearborne should really put your talents to better use.
I'll go turn off that music right away.
hate to be a party pooper, but you got a livestock permit for that pig?
what pig? - That pig.
Oh, I don't know what you're talking about.
it was there a second ago.
have you been drinking?
no, damm it. I know what I saw.
I know what I saw, I'm a good cop.
of course you are.
everybody knows that.
here. Why don't you stay and relax a little bit?
just one.
I am on the clock.
come on.
Yes, god is love.
he's the force of love, but how do we respond to forces that block, undermine, and destroy love?
well, you cannot love evil.
you have to hate it.
so hating evil is really loving good.
good.
I never really thought about it that way.
hate isn't just natural, Jason.
we need it in order to survive.
my father dedicated his life to god.
to protecting the human race.
they murdered him, his wife, and my baby sister in cold blood.
they're baby-killers.
that's what they're capable of.
now, if I didn't hate vampires, and do everything in my power to avenge my family's death, what kind of man would I be?
um, a pretty bad one.
and what's going on out there is a war.
not right now, Jason, but in general.
and we all gotta choose sides.
now, you're either on the side of darkness, or the side of light.
light. - There's no in between.
hope you boys saved room for some banana pudding.
Oh, thanks, honey.
Oh, Sarah's pudding is a little slice of heaven.
Oh, don't go bragging on me in front of the company.
well, you stop being such an angel and maybe I will.
I'm gonna go get the whipped cream.
you know, my wife must think you're pretty special.
Really?
well, Sarah doesn't whip out her pudding for just anybody.
God's got great things in store for you, Jason Stackhouse.
can you feel it?
Yeah.
Yeah, I feel it.
I always wanted to see the inside of vampire Bill's house.
you get to live here?
it's pretty cool.
not really.
I mean, it's full of his creepy old stuff.
he makes me sleep in a hole.
Yeah.
my mama keeps her doll collection in my closet.
Oh, you got a Wii?
a what?
a w-- you never played a Wii?
Oh, you'll love it.
Yeah, so you can race cars, um, or you can play tennis, or you can-- you can dance.
or you can shoot people.
well, I've never done any of that.
well, here, I'll show you.
so, uh, may I?
okay. So these are the controllers.
you just hold that like that.
no, no, don't do that.
you don't have to hide that from me, that's natural.
how can you say that?
I mean, I have fangs, and they just come out and I can't control them, and-- this is so embarrassing.
I'd die if I wasn't already dead.
don't be embarrassed about what you are.
because what you are is great.
you think I'm great?
I like you.
I like you a lot.
and that's why I think we ought to wait, you know, before we do anything else.
I've waited too long already.
you sure we can't take you to the hospital?
the jobs and I still ain't got no health insurance.
besides, the bullet went straight through,
I'll get my uncle stitch it up in the morning.
your uncle, the veterinarian?
he chops off steer nuts for a living, he can handle the few stitches.
don't worry, Sook.
I'm fine.
you don't look fine.
far as I'm concerned, I spent the last two weeks at Club Med.
drinking a Margarita and getting my chest waxed.
and I appreciate it if you tell your friends that's how I remember it.
that would be wise.
at least let Bill help you inside. - No.
Sook, I said I'm fine.
I used to get so mad when people judged vampires just for being different.
it's like they were judging me too.
I told myself their fear was nothing but small-mindedness, but maybe that's just what I wanted to believe, because the more open my mind gets, the more evil I see.
most of us, vampire, human, or otherwise, are capable of both good and evil.
often simultaneously.
you can't expect me to believe that Eric's capable of anything good.
not after how he tortured Lafayette.
I have had worse sheriffs.
I don't understand how you can defend him.
he saved your life.
I can still hate him.
I hate that he may be putting you in harm's way once again for his own selfish reasons.
and I hate that he has shown you the barbarousness that we call justice.
if I could glamour it away for you, I would.
I'm glad you can't.
I'm sick of things sneaking up on me.
rene and whatever the hell that was that attacked me last night.
if I'm never gonna be safe,
I'd rather know what to be afraid of.
well, after last night,
I hope that that doesn't include me.
I know there's darkness in you.
I know there is.
and it scares the life out of me.
but you're right.
there's goodness in you too.
and when I look in your eyes, that's what I see.
I feel so unbelievably fucking good right now.
that's how you feel to me too, baby.
got room for one more?
you guys are so beautiful.
I'm a licensed massage therapist.
who wants to go first?
Oh, you got a big knot right there.
Tara. Oh, come on, Tara.
Hey, Tara. Hey, come on.
that girl in the tub was drunk, I don't even know who she was.
looked like you wanted to know her a lot better.
I just got carried away, that's all.
Yeah, you and everybody else out there.
is this what Maryann's about?
are you in the lifestyle? - Lifestyle?
Tara, that's just a bunch of drunk-ass people trying to let loose, have a good time.
that's got nothing to do with us.
I don't give a crap what people do with their own body parts, but there's no us if this is your scene.
God damm it.
Aw, hell.
I wasn't gonna run off without saying goodbye to you.
I'm sure gonna miss you, buddy.
all right. One last time.
let's go. Come on.
Oh, you can't keep up with me.
see, I knew it.
underneath that tough vampire exterior, you're nothing but a big softie.
don't tell anybody.
wow, that's a lot of pink, Bill.
I'm sure Jessica will love it.
Yes, well, I remember when ladies' clothing stores sold petticoats.
heh, that's just weird.
actually, I kind of miss them at times.
they left something to the imagination.
unfastening them required a certain skill.
I think there's a Halloween store around here that might still have some.
you are such a tease.
I wasn't doing anything, I wasn't gonna bite him, I swear.
it's okay.
bill, don't.
what's your problem?
come on in, the water's warm.
fine.
suit yourself.
were you just talking to that dog?
what are you doing out here in the middle of the night?
same as you, I guess.
just trying to cool off.
and I can't sleep.
see, I have this hard-ass boss, who really laid into me this week.
sounds like a jerk.
he's not all bad.
he can be real nice.
to dogs.
listen, I'm sorry.
I've had a lot on my mine.
I know how hard you're trying, and I think you're starting to get the hang of it.
I really do.
you're even worse at lying than you are at being a boss, Sam, but I'll take what I can get, so thanks.
you're welcome.
this water really warm, or you lying about that too?
Oh, no, it's great.
nothing like a midnight swim to wash away the troubles.
you should try it sometime.
Yeah, I think I will.
you mean now?
it's a big lake, Sam, I think there's room for both of us, ain't there?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
guess so. Come on in.
just give in.
it feels so good.
Tara, what's she done to you?
what the...?
stop, Sam.
I'm here, Sam.
you're gonna be the one.
Hey!
nobody move!
I said don't fuckin' move!
what the hell are you doing?
put on some goddamn pants.
what the hell?
Godric, can you hear me?
Isabel and Eric sent us. Godric!
I know he's down here somewhere.
I heard the awful things they're planning to do to him.
remember how I said I was claustrophobic?
I wasn't making that part up. It's bad.
okay, I can't take elevators, walk-in closets.
you know, hotels where they tuck the sheets in all tight?
just thinking about that makes me want to scream.
Jesus christ, vampire exterminator?
silver and stakes?
send them back to hell? - Sookie.
so sick teaching kids to hate like this.
Sookie, I don't have time for games right now. I need to get out of here.
take a deep breath.
look at me.
it's gonna be okay.
we're gonna figure this out, all right?
okay.
okay.
okay, I'm okay.
so the newlins knew who we were the minute we walked in.
same way they knew to come after me at the airport.
cause someone at that nest is a traitor.
you think a vampire's siding with the fellowship to get Godric out of the way?
Stan? Cause he wants to be shiff?
I've heard of ambitious, but that's just plain crazy.
well, you've met him.
I mean, he would rip our throats out for looking at him sideways.
if it's true, Bill and Eric could do a lot worse to him when they find out.
bill had to have sensed my fear.
he's gonna come storming through this church any second.
and you don't seem happy about that because?
these fanatics are about to barbecue a 2000-year-old vampire in front of the entire congregation.
who knows what else they're capable of?
get out of my way!
but we have so much catchin' up to do.
move now!
I will not ask again.
you smell like her. Sweet.
and cheap.
william Compton, you're still so sensitive.
some might say it's a weakness, but I've, I always found it oddly cute.
we can play this game all night, but we both know I am stronger and faster, so really, what's the point?
what are you doing here?
I've missed you.
it's been so long.
Los Angeles, 1935
you're back early.
I loathe musicals.
they're always so desperately cheerful, aren't they?
I brought you a present.
Frances, this is alfred. Alfred, frances.
hello. - Frances is in this chorus.
she has real talent.
show him.
right here? - That will not be necessary.
don't mind him.
he's in one of his moods. Again.
but I'm sure we can find a way to cheer him up.
I meant what I said. No more.
you can't starve yourself, darling.
just taste her.
she smells like...apricots.
remember those?
leave now.
you are such a wet blanket.
I don't know why I keep bothering with you.
why do you?
I can't stand the sight of you.
so dramatic.
perhaps we should head back south.
this town's a cultural desert.
it's no wonder we are so depressed. - I'm not depressed.
I'm seeing clearly for the first time in years.
I won't do this any longer. It's over.
no more innocent lives and bldy beds and cruelty for sport.
you are a vampire. They are food.
that's your nature. - No.
it is your nature.
you have lost your humanity, and you have stolen mine, made me into a monster.
I forgot myself, and I will have to live with the things we've done for an eternity.
I sometimes forget how young you are.
this conscience of yours, you will outgrow it. Trust me.
we will get through this together.
I will never again be what you want me to be.
if Sookie is hurt in any way because of you,
I will not stop until I drive a stake through whatever semblance of a heart you have left.
it's true.
you're in love with a human.
that's so tragic it's funny.
you have got to be joking me.
this is the fellowship of the sun?
that's their army?
scared little boys with bibles and crossbows.
don't underestimate them.
support for their movement is growing.
their leadership camps are overflowing with self-righteous extremists, all willing and ready to die for their cause.
that can be arranged quite easily.
not until we know for sure the fellowship has Godric.
what about your boy Hugo, and Sookie?
they've been in there too long.
there's no sign of alarm.
and if Hugo were in serious danger, I would know it.
I felt something earlier, but it passed.
he's okay now.
tell me, what is it that you find so fulfilling about human companionship?
they feel much more strongly than we do.
everything is urgent, exciting.
maybe because their lives are so temporary.
Yes, they certainly don't keep well.
don't you find the prospect of him growing old, sickly, crippled, somewhat, uh, repulsive?
no.
I find it curious.
like a science project.
how does Bill Compton feel about your interest in Sookie?
I'm not interested in Sookie.
and even less in how Bill Compton feels.
my only interest is finding Godric.
of course.
don't look at me like that.
do you really believe these fools could overpower a vampire such as Godric and hold him for weeks?
Stan is sure of it.
but I have known Godric a long time.
it's hard to imagine anything could overpower him.
not anything human.
Aw, it just don't make sense.
how something wrong could feel that right.
Hey, ain't that a song?
Hey.
don't cry, huh?
it's my fault.
if anyone's going to hell, it's gonna be me.
I wanted this every bit as much as you did.
and the strange thing is, I don't even feel guilty about it.
so you're crying cause...?
because I'm so happy.
Oh, Jason.
I thought I loved Steve, but I never even knew what love was until you just showed me.
that's, uh, intense, huh?
I know.
right now, here with you,
I feel closer to god than I ever have.
come on, we have to go.
Yeah. Yeah, I gotta get ready for training.
no, forget training.
we have to go tell Steve.
what?
vow of honesty, Jason.
just 'cause I broke my vows to my husband doesn't mean I'm ready to throw all my beliefs out the window.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Ho... hold on a sec.
we just can't walk in there and tell him.
no, we have to.
somehow, someday, god will forgive us.
it's the only way we can have a future together.
let's just think about this for a second.
a) Steve has guns.
then there's the lockdown tomorrow night.
and secondly, we're gonna be locked in this church with Steve and his guns all night.
Oh my lord, the lock-in.
the morning ceremony.
you're right. - Right.
we have to put god's interests before our own.
that's right. God comes first.
but I promise you, when I am standing up there next to Steve, all I'm gonna be thinking about is you.
Yup. Yeah, me too.
and the minute it's over, we'll tell him, right?
Absolutely. I can't wait.
me either.
okay? - Okay.
there's something I have to tell you.
I haven't... I ain't never told nobody before.
not even my best friend.
hell, especially not my best friend.
I ain't never done it.
with a girl, I mean.
what have you done it with?
just myself.
Oh, so you're a virgin.
Oh.
well.
well, big whoop. So am I.
you are?
well, just 'cause I'm a vampire, you think I'm a slut?
of course not.
I don't think you could ever be a slut.
I don't think anybody is, really.
some people, they just want somebody to be with.
well, I totally would have been a slut if I could have gotten away with it.
me and my friend laurie, we had this bet since eighth grade over who'd lose it first.
I mean, she was like pregnant before I even got my first kiss.
man, my dad was such a dickhead.
so what's your excuse?
I was gonna wait, you know, till I met the right one.
uh, but the right one just never showed up, and by then I'd waited for so long,
I figured I can't just give it away to anybody.
so now I'm 28.
and most girls probably think I'm like some kind of bisexual gay or something.
not that I got any kind of problem with them.
but I'm not.
well, I'm not most girls.
I'm not even a girl, technically.
but if you're okay with that,
I'd be your first.
you would?
now?
no, silly. No, not tonight.
um, it's gonna be dawn soon. I get sick if I don't rest during the day.
it's no problem. That's great.
but, uh, we can cuddle if you like.
just don't freak out if I look a little dead.
maybe the little rats have run off.
joined the fellowship themselves.
careful. Hugo is mine. - Oh, please.
if you cared about him so much, we'd have been in that church hours ago.
with no plan, no exit strategy.
that's why you'll never be sheriff, stan. You don't think.
and you're too chicken shit to act.
that's why we been getting Godric's coffee for the last 40 years.
and you, fellowship has your maker and your telepath, and still you do nothing.
are you questioning my loyalty, Stan?
just trying to return Godric to his rightful position.
Oh, really?
cause I think maybe you have another agenda.
maybe you think starting a war with the fellowship will distract us from the truth
that you're so starved for power, you murdered Godric for his title.
that is a lie.
how dare you accuse me?
Eric, we don't know this. There's no proof.
not yet.
but I will find it.
and when I do, there will be no mercy.
in the meantime, you two can stand here and quibble over his position, or run into that church and kill them all. I no longer care.
if Godric is gone, nothing will bring back what I have lost.
eggs, wake up.
Hey, gorgeous.
what are we doing on the couch?
how'd we get here?
I have no idea.
last thing I remember was following those reese's pieces clothes into the woods.
I don't even remember coming back here.
wow, me neither.
I guess that joint must have knocked us out cold.
uh, that's never happened to me before, at least not from smokin' one joint.
it's happened to me a couple times.
uh, maryann's weed is some serious shit.
yesterday, that weird place you took me to with the blood, - you couldn't remember. - Look, I got no idea what that is, but I'm pretty sure it's got nothing to do with us getting high and passin' out, okay?
well, maybe we been smoking too much. Maybe we need to sober up.
Hey, that's okay.
I'm high enough just being with you.
Oh, listen.
just because you got a little too stoned, that don't make you your mama.
you're right.
sometimes it's like you're Sookie.
like you can read my mind or something.
I just get you, that's all.
morning. Refreshments?
how did you all sleep?
they're coming for us, you know?
Yeah. Well, that's what I thought.
figured a pretty girl like you'd have a vamp running off to her rescue.
we were kinda hoping for it, weren't we, Gabe?
Yes, sir. Bring it on.
Yeah, we're ready for them.
we've been ready for a long time.
you're gonna get yourself killed.
that's not threat, it's a fact.
well, they've got you all twisted up, haven't they, with their
with their glamoring and their empty promises and their evil blood.
you're the ones who are twisted.
you call yourself christians?
Jesus would be ashamed of you.
well, I guess we're just gonna have to agree to disagree on that one.
now, things got a little out of hand last night, and I apologize for that.
I'm not the monster that the vampire-loving media makes me out to be.
Yeah, right.
all I want is a couple of answers, and then I'll be happy to feed you a nice breakfast and send you on your way.
what do you want to know? - Shut up.
we need to get out of here.
just tell them what they want to know.
her name is Sookie stackhouse, and I'm Hugo ayers.
Hugo, no.
we were sent here by the vampires of area nine to find their sheriff.
from bon temps?
how do you know where I'm from?
you're Jason stackhouse's...
sister. Am I right?
you know Jason?
he's got nothing to do with this.
come on, Gabe.
how do you know my brother?
nice work.
Hey, we sat down here all night waiting for your boyfriend to show up.
you can play damsel in distress all you want, but one way or another, I'm getting us out of here.
Hugo, do me a favor, please. Just shut the fuck up.
Barry. Barry, can you hear me?
you've got to help me.
I need you to go to the hotel and find Bill Compton and tell him I'm at fellowship of the sun church in the basement.
the sheriff is here somewhere and I'm in big trouble.
please don't ignore me.
this is a life or death situation. Please.
we need to rest.
so the minute I shut my eyes, you can run into the sunlight and destroy yourself to save her?
care about you too much to allow that.
I may love her, but I am not suicidal.
I know better than anyone what you are capable of.
Lorena, this is foolish.
we are getting weaker. The bleeds have begun.
you may be able to keep me here awake for a day, maybe two, but not forever.
you're right.
forever is a long time.
then again,
I'm very patient.
and who were you gonna call?
if you will not let me go to her, at least let me find someone who will.
I am begging you.
let me call and wake up Eric Northman.
he is the reason that Sookie's in danger.
he is also the reason I'm here.
he wants the girl, William.
just let him have her.
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Hey, stackhouse.
how's it going? - Looking good.
Hey, where you off to, Jason?
Oh, uh, heh-heh, just taking a walk.
with your suitcase? - Yeah.
get in the car, Stackhouse.
get in the fucking car. - Okay, okay.
now.
go.
with a bull mask and these giant claws.
claws?
and the whole town had these big black-saucer eyes like zombies.
good morning.
Maryann, you okay?
Oh, I am fantastic.
I slept outside last night and I communed with my animal nature.
no shit.
this little fella hopped by, and I thought, mmm, yummy. Rabbit stew.
poor bunny.
feeling sorry for things is just an excuse not to celebrate your own happiness.
speaking of...
you two look positively glowy. What did you do last night?
Oh, um, we just crashed out, I guess.
uh, did you throw a party here while we were gone?
cause when we got home, the place looked like a frat house.
I had a few people over for drinks. That a problem?
it's Sookie's house, and she can come home anytime.
and when she does,
I'm sure she'll be grateful that you fixed that nasty old water heater and you took care of the place.
you're such a good friend.
she is so fucking weird. - I know. Isn't it great?
you know what burns me the most, is that I brought you into my home.
I treated you like family. - I know, and I'm so sorry.
it's just that, uh, I'm weak. - Yes, you are.
I gave you a chance at salvation, a chance to live in his holy light, and you chose them?
I know it was wrong.
wait. Who are "them"?
Oh, please, cut the act.
I know who you are and who you're working for.
the-the road crew?
that's funny.
Oh, boy, I didn't think that you were the sharpest tool in the shed.
good at taking orders, but not too bright.
but boy, was I wrong.
you are snakier than a snake in the grass.
Steve, buddy.
you're making a mistake, okay?
uh, you're confusing me with-- with somebody else or something.
say a prayer.
you are going to hell.
and you are going there today.
Steve. - Take care of him.
Yes, sir.
start walking, vampire lover. Come on.
Hello, Sam.
been looking for you.
figured you would be.
now, what's that for? - Come any closer, you'll find out.
you think I'm scared of dying?
I know you're scared of maryann.
those scars on your back, that how she got you to be her whore?
it ain't whoring if you do it for love.
you can stop pretending you ever gave a shit about me.
honey, I ain't talking 'bout you.
we had fun, but- we had fun?
I fucking trusted you!
I shared parts of myself I never shared with anyone.
how can you do this to your own kind?
Sam, I used to be scared and stupid, full of shame, just like you.
she could've killed me.
I deserved it.
but she saw something in me, and she saved me.
gave me a whole new life.
no fear, no limits, just love.
killing peop, cutting out their hearts, that ain't love.
you know what you are next to maryann?
an ant. No, a flea.
it's kinda perfect.
if I'm so fucking insignificant, why is she going through all this trouble trying to get me?
cause you got away from her once.
she can't control you.
see those funny big black-eyes folks we were runnin' around with acting all crazy?
that's maryann's energy inside of them.
she is driving them like tiny little remote control airplanes.
but that don't work on us 'cause we're shifters?
all supernaturals, we got a natural resistance.
and she can force our shifts and other stuff with other supes, but she can't get inside us.
we gotta go to her on our own free will, and she just loves a challenge.
I'm not a challenge,
I'm a person.
well, not exactly.
I'm sweating like a pig.
God.
you want to get wet with me one last time, Sammy?
what is she?
what the fuck is she?
she's god, dumb-dumb.
Hey.
Hey, I need to use the bathroom.
Hey! Come on, let me out of here!
here.
I'll turn my back. - I don't need that.
I need to get the hell out of here.
Hugo, this is not helping.
just sit down.
just look, try to relax.
praise his light. Open your hearts.
I'll infiltrate the fellowship.
absolutely not. - Let her speak.
they're sending in a spy tomorrow. I'll be with her.
you.
you're the traitor.
Maryann is not god.
well, she's as close to god as we'll ever get.
people call her all kinds of things.
Kali, Lilith, Isis, Gaia.
but what she really is, is a maenad.
what the fuck is that?
according to the greeks, maenads were handmaidens of dionysus.
but they're really a lot more than that.
Dionysus, the god of wine?
maybe if you own a bar I suppose it makes sense that you would know that one.
but guess what else they called him?
the horned god.
sound familiar?
Satan?
Dionysus, Satan.
it's really just a kind of energy.
wild energy, like lust, anger, excess, violence.
basically, all the fun stuff.
Maryann brings it out in people.
she channels it, controls it.
she's immortal, Sam.
she never wasn't here, so there ain't no point in fightin' her. You see, you'll never win.
I'm not gonna just let her kill me.
being a part of something divine is worth dying a thousand timeS. You'll see.
if I give myself up, will she go away, leave everyone alone?
I wouldn't bet on that.
she's having too much fun, and this town's full of crazies ripe for the picking.
she's like a pyro in a room full of matches.
just go to her, Sam.
play nice.
she might even let you live.
stay the fuck away from me.
I used to be just like you.
thought I was a real emancipated thinker, especially when isabel took me to bed, and the sex was...
amazing.
the best I have... well, you know.
it's addictive, isn't it?
to be desired by something that powerful.
I'm no addict.
Nah. I guess you wouldn't know how, uh, your life changes to suit them.
you start missing work, can't get up in the morning, can't stand to leave them after dark.
before you know it, you're somebody you don't even recognize.
so you went to the fellowship because you can't control yourself?
I begged her to turn me.
it was the only way we could be together as equals.
but see, they don't want us to be equals.
no, she's just been using me.
the Same way that Bill's been using you.
you don't know Bill.
I know he and his friends are having you do their dirty work.
I mean, a telepath's gotta be a real trophy for a vampire.
shut up.
all they care about is their own kind.
okay, that's why I joined the fellowship.
so if the newlins care so much about you, how come you're still in here?
face it, Hugo.
you're nothing but a fangbanging traitor to them.
Gabe, she knows everything.
you can let me out now.
Hey. Anybody.
come on, let me out!
Yup, you're so all-fired important to them, aren't you?
welcome. So glad you're here. Praise his light.
cute pajamas.
this is your first lock-in, right?
I'm excited too. Amen.
Hey, darling. Looking good.
you too.
well, I told you that suit was a winner.
I need to talk to you in private.
it's about Jason stackhouse.
of course.
I'm a good soldier for christ, and
I'm tellin' you, man, there's been some kind of mistake here.
you're damn right there's been a mistake, boy.
and it started the minute your mama spread her legs and pushed out you and your whore of a sister.
don't ever talk about my sister.
that the best you can do, sister fucker?
no, that's the best I can do, dick brain.
forget what I said last week. Live in the now, baby doll.
cause I'm back and I'm packing somethin' wild. You feel me?
so, yes or no, sweetness?
cause this shit is going faster than fritters at a fat farm.
I can do half a vial. - Well, okay.
eggs, tara, you all seen Sam?
he ain't here.
blew off the whole day with little miss employee of the month.
thank you, jesus, santa claus and hare krishna.
I need to borrow her a minute.
wait for me.
okay.
excuse you. It says "ladies" on that door.
so what you skank ho's doing in here?
watch yourself, bitch.
I am. And I's is gorgeous.
how's your leg?
great.
what? I got a powerful immune system.
you got powerful death wish is what you got.
and we're gonna talk about this later.
Oh, Tara.
Oh, god, I think I might have done something bad, something real bad.
Hey, coming out of your mouth, that's scary.
so Terry and I, we've been, you know... fucking.
no.
well, lord knows I've been pulling out all the stops.
my hot oils, my nasty lingerie, heh, but every time we get cozier than first base, he goes running like somebody lit a fire in his whiteys.
okay, cut to the real bad part.
so last night,
I thought I'd try getting, uh, a few drinks in him, loosen him up and, um, seemed like it was working pretty good.
till I blacked out.
you blacked out?
hadn't happened to me since junior prom.
the thing is...
I think I might of had my way...
with him a little bit, kinda against his will, maybe?
are you telling me you date-raped terry bellefleur?
how's that even possible? - God, I don't know.
but he was just, he was acting so weird when we woke up.
I mean, weirder than usual.
and, um, there were certain telltale signs that we'd... you know?
and you don't remember anything?
no.
now, see, that just ain't motherfucking fair.
excuse me?
the first time in my goddamn life I ain't chasin' after trouble...
and it just keep walking in my fucking door.
look at you. Damn.
ain't nothing good can come out of something so pretty.
you must be lafayette.
I'm eggs.
Tara's eggs?
you know, that just don't sound right.
your name's benedict. Why don't people call you ben?
or dictionary. - Behave.
Satan in a sunday hat, girl.
I'm trying to tell you, satan in a beautiful fucking sunday hat.
get out here.
I'm gonna kick your ass so hard, you'll be shitting boots.
Andy, what happened to your arm?
I ain't talking to you, devil worshiper.
I saw you last night.
I saw all of you.
you? You saw us what?
Aw, go ahead, deny it.
laugh at the crazy drunk guy, but I know what I saw.
Terry. He ain't here, Andy. You want me to go call him?
fuck you, zombie woman. - Andy.
fuck you all devil zombies.
turning this town into a orgy from hell.
I'll stop you.
I will stop ya if it's the last thing I ever do.
Oh, my god.
did you smell him?
at least it never gets boring around here.
pick you up later?
Hey, Sam.
Sam. You look like you just saw a ghost.
Oh, hey.
I was just, uh, decorating.
I got these at the gift store downstairs.
blood scented.
but to me, they just smelled like soup.
you like them?
they're perfect.
that's what I was going for.
cause you're perfect, and I want your first time to be as perfect as you are.
Hoyt, just take off your pants.
okay.
fuck. Shit!
thank god it's you.
been running for hours.
steve and gabe, they've gone crazy.
they... they tried to kill me.
Sarah. No.
finally.
I've missed you.
thank you for your service.
what happened to your face?
listen, she knows everything, which never would have happened if you hadn't kept me locked down with a goddamn mind reader.
I hope the reverend knows that I'm gonna need protection now.
you want protection, you fangbanging sack of shit?
how's that for protection, huh?
here's a little more protection for ya.
stop it!
you and your moron brother think you make an asshole out of me?
that's what you think, huh?
get your filthy hands off me!
Yeah, what's wrong? Your own kind not good enough for you?
how about if I show you what you've been missing?
and a decade or so in Miami.
the beaches are gorgeous at night, and the German tourists are delicious.
open that door and I will end you.
I've given you everything. Everything!
and you threw it away moaning over what you've lost.
you disgust me.
then let me go. - No.
I made you, and you are mine.
you know I don't love you.
you have never tried.
I have spent decades trying!
I despise myself for what I did for you.
God help me, I killed innocent people to prove to you that I loved you.
but it was pure nihilism.
I do not,
I cannot,
I will never love you.
men have readily laid down their lives to spend just one night with me.
what more can I give?
then what is it that you want from me?
choice.
let me go.
without me, you would be alone forever.
you're the one that's afraid of that.
you are the saddest, loneliest creature I have ever known.
how dare you!
you hate me that much?
let me go.
I cannot live without you.
you'll have to.
no, don't.
as your maker...
I release you.
you released me.
there was nothing left between us.
what could you possibly have to gain from this?
you're making a fool of yourself with that girl.
you have no future with her.
everyone knows it but you.
someday, you'll see this for what it is, an act of love.
yes?
I have a message for Bill Compton. He there?
I'm sorry, he's tied up right now.
I'll be happy to pass it along.
tell him Sookie stackhouse is in the basement of the fellowship of the sun church.
she said the sheriff's there and she's in some kind of trouble.
Sookie, you hear me?
this is the last time I'm doin' you and your vampire buddies a favor, so don't even...
No! No!
Yeah, show me how you scream for that big fat vampire cock.
scream for me, baby.
well, guess who turned out to be completely unworthy of our trust.
no.
Why? What's happened?
he's been hiding something very interesting from us all.
are you serious?
I am almost 3000 years old.
Eric, get her out of here, please.
Eric, what are you doing?
I wouldn't let go of this if I were you.
I don't know what it is, but I do know it's quite valuable.
Eric, what the fuck?
I've not had the pleasure of tasting it, but all my instincts say it would be quite extraordinary.
I will never, ever forgive you for this.
it thinks we're equals.
Oh, but it's wrong. Isn't it?
indeed.
do you care nothing about our home?
Talbot, not now. - When?
what are you going to do with our Mr. Compton, if I may ask?
Marco, Klaus, take Mr. Compton to the slave quarters.
there, my dear, you will kill him. - No!
but what's...? - Do not defy me!
I am your king!
your Majesty.
take Miss Stackhouse into the library, Eric.
I wanna ask her a few questions after I repair the state of affairs of my marriage.
bill, I will get you out of here.
Eric, you save her, I beg you.
if you do kill him... I will kill you.
Oh, please. Please try.
without that sanctimonious little prick, Godric, to save you,
I would just love to rip you open and wear your rib cage as a hat.
please tell me you were just doing that for the king's benefit.
I don't think anyone plays the king of Mississippi and gets away with it.
I certainly have no intentions of trying.
why are you even here?
I thought you had other things to deal with.
Yeah, I do, and I need to think.
so please don't take this the wrong way, but shut up.
Eric, please, I'm begging you... - Thank you.
and what is your vegetable of the day?
that would be the peas.
and how are those prepared?
those are dumped out of a can into a big pot and heated up.
I mean, where do you think you are, lady, Red Lobster?
Hey, I am paying good money to eat here.
you wanna keep any of that cheap dyed hair you better stop mouthing off to me.
tap the titty. - Oh, come on.
well, that sucked. And not in a good way.
lafayette, I got an order.
what? Sam and Tommy already done gone. Ain't we closed yet?
Nope. Curlers over there wants the chicken fried steak, extra gravy on the side, extra mash, no veggies.
hell, no. - You want me to help?
can you cook? I can do a lot of things.
Oh, Lordy.
and I want a freshly cut lemon in my iced tea, not some dried-out thing that's been sitting around all day.
Dagnabbit. Look what I just did.
Oh, I got lemon juice on it too.
no, sorry. Arlene, sometimes it just happens.
please don't kill me. I'm pregnant.
that probably just makes you wanna eat me even more.
Oh, God.
this is why people hate y'all.
I just haven't eaten in days.
I love how warm you are.
I feel like I'm on fire. - Yeah. Me too.
that's because we are...
on fire.
I ain't no virgin.
me neither.
but you make me feel like one.
not me.
you make me feel like 110 percent woman.
don't hurt me.
or do.
I don't care.
what the hell's that supposed to mean?
I ain't into any pervert stuff.
what? I didn't mean it like that.
then what in blazes was it you did mean?
I meant... Um...
don't break my heart.
what did I say?
this ain't right.
it ain't
I wanted to just get a taste of something I could remember forever, but...
goddamn it, I ain't gonna let you see me cry.
Hey, there's no reason for you to cry.
not when you're with me.
I'll take care of you.
what?
I gotta go.
no. Crystal.
keep it down. - Hey.
I ain't letting you go. - Ain't nobody owns me.
well, when am I gonna see you again? Never.
this can't happen. It's too dangerous.
dangerous? Why?
just forget me, for both our sakes.
so all that stuff about caring about me, that was just crap?
I never said I cared about you. Maybe you dreamt it.
you big phony. Big hat, no cattle.
do you mind? I'm trying to think here.
I thought you said my life was too valuable to throw away.
you are valuable, that's very clear.
I'm just not sure why.
Sookie, I'm risking everything to tell you this, because you mean so much to me. You make me feel almost human.
you mean nothing to me, understand? Nothing.
I'm close to getting something I've wanted since I was still human.
do not get in my way.
I hate your fucking guts, Eric Northman.
I promise I will pay you back for this.
sorry to have kept you waiting.
a husband's work is never done.
leave us. - As you wish.
now, tell me what you are.
I'm a waitress. - Yes, and I am Marie of Romania.
I'm a very patient man, Miss Stackhouse.
one can afford to be when one is immortal. But my patience is not without limits.
Oh, God, I hate leaving the kids with Terry this long.
he's always so frazzled when I get home.
uh, where's Lafayette?
he and that Jesus guy left.
said to tell you to lock up before you leave.
okay. But just so you know, this necklace is pure silver, and I take garlic supplements too.
Arlene, just because my fangs popped out, doesn't mean I'm gonna use 'em on you.
I just wish this awful night was over.
you know every single one of my customers stiffed me?
well, let me take care of her for you.
don't... Don't kill her or anything.
excuse me, ma'am?
you're not hungry anymore.
now, I want you take all the money you have and leave it on the table then head to the ladies', alrighty?
she'll be gone soon.
ma'am? You okay in there?
ma'am?
thank you so much.
you are the best waitress I've ever had.
Hey. - Hi.
not such a bad night after all, huh?
you got a nice tip and nobody got killed.
see you tomorrow.
no fucking way.
so what? I was born here.
you never wanted to leave?
ever since the day I was born.
I've been places, I just never stayed.
I've always come back here.
you're not done with this place.
feels like it's not done with me. So where you from?
uh... I was born in Catemaco. - Catemaco.
but mi mami dragged me all over the fucking globe.
texas, Uruguay... Heh.
portugal, you name it. Montreal.
no papi?
no, I've got one.
it's just nobody knows who he is.
mami was raped. - Get the fuck out.
Yeah.
makes all those jokes your mom cracks about me raping her that much funnier.
maybe I was wrong about you.
maybe I actually can relate to you.
why would you think that you couldn't?
does term "Satan in a Sunday hat" mean anything to you?
bitch, my name is Jesus, bro.
I am the polar opposite of Satan.
you'd better be.
can I kiss you?
fuck me. I shouldn't have asked.
I should have just done it, right?
uh... I have a rule, though.
no sex on the first date.
okay.
sometimes I have a hard time keeping that rule.
I think... I think we should follow that rule.
give us somewhere to go. - Yeah, right.
sure. - Unless...
because I'm feeling something all kind of intense with you.
are you? - Yeah.
I'm not sure I should trust it.
I'm getting kind of hard just looking at you.
damn.
isn't it warm out for a fire?
I suppose it is. I love a good fire.
there's something primal about it.
always makes things more dramatic.
now... it's time for you to answer my questions, Miss Stackhouse.
fine. I have some questions for you too.
Oh, honey.
there's a fine line between feisty and delusional.
you're not really in any position to bargain.
you don't know that. - Oh, now it's getting interesting.
so I'll answer one of your questions and you'll answer one of mine?
who goes first?
are you the king of all vampires? - Heavens no, my dear girl.
I am merely the king of Mississippi.
do you have a crown? - I have several.
that's two questions. My turn.
what are you?
you're definitely not human.
my parents were human. - How do you know?
and how do you know they were your parents, for that matter?
my grandfather was like me.
which is?
I can hear people's thoughts.
and shifters', werewolves'.
not vampires'.
how dreadful that must be. - Oh, you have no idea.
I mean, who cares what anyone else is thinking?
my turn.
is Lorena gonna kill Bill?
if she knows what's good for her.
but she'll take her time.
he's been her drug of choice for centuries now.
she's gonna have a hard time letting go.
please.
you can stop her.
why would you want me to?
are you aware that your noble Mr. Compton...
has been keeping a secret file on you?
on your family?
what the...? - My turn.
what are you besides a telepath?
and what on Earth makes that light come out of your hands?
don't make me force it out of you.
I don't know.
I never even knew I could do it until recently, and
I don't know what I am.
maybe I'm an alien.
all I know is it's something big, so if I were you I wouldn't hurt me or anyone I care about.
are there other powers? - It's my turn.
are there other powers?
once I threw a chain at somebody and it wrapped around his neck by itself, like that face-crab thing from Alien.
that's all.
well.
no wonder the queen is so...
there's a queen? - Oh, sweetheart.
you really don't know anything at all, do you?
I do miss the 1930s.
such style, elegance.
people knew how to behave and what was expected of them.
they knew how to avoid creating tragedies for the people they loved.
I may not be able to make you feel anything for me, but...
I will make you feel.
you have always so enjoyed making others suffer.
and there's nothing wrong with that.
especially having been made to suffer as I have been.
you haven't suffered at the hands of others for a very long time.
I am suffering now.
please... do it quickly.
even as you face the true death...
I will be inside you.
not Sookie, me.
I wish I had known you before you were made, before you turned hard.
I would've liked to have seen you smile with light in your eyes...
instead of darkness.
that would have been something.
I have no choice.
where you been?
Tara, I will not be policed.
of course not. I'm not pol...
I just really missed you, Franklin.
couldn't wait for you to get back.
Really?
I find that hard to believe.
you haven't even noticed that I've shaved.
I wanted to...
I wanted to look nice for you.
it's our wedding night tomorrow.
by the way, your friend Sookie, - she's been brought here. - What is Russell gonna do to her?
so that means my work for Russell is officially over, which means you've got me all to yourself.
don't promise me something you can't deliver, now.
untie me.
two hands are better than none.
why, you wicked little strumpet.
I'm gonna drink your blood tomorrow night.
Oh, yes, you are. - I want it now.
I wanna experience being high on you while making love to you.
knowing it's my last act as human,
I wanna have the most amazing sex any human can have before I give myself to you...
in death.
kinky. - Yeah.
fucked up. Crazy.
I'll go there. - I bet you will.
will you? - Bring it.
bite me.
bite into my flesh.
taste my blood, my sinew, my bones.
open me up.
taste me, drink me, feed on me.
you don't have to ask me twice.
fuck, yeah!
kill me.
kill me hard.
kill me.
Hey, wait a minute. That's not how you play Kaiserspiel.
we're playing Karnoffel.
I'm sorry.
I haven't played this game in centuries.
Russell taught me this game when I was still human.
how long have you been together?
uh, just shy of 700 years.
although sometimes it feels like 7 million.
well, I hope he knows just how lucky he is.
Oh, believe me... he knows.
get your hands off me! - Carlo!
take this. - Let go of me.
and have Timothy bring the car around.
let me go! - Where are you going now?
I have business. - Again?
Yes. - Eric!
please, save Bill!
Mr. Northman, would you accompany me this evening?
it would be an honor. - You never take me anywhere.
because you prefer to be in the company of sycophants.
deep down, my darling, you're a very weak character.
he's in one of his moods. Well, never mind.
we have much more pressing matters at hand.
we're gonna see an old friend of yours.
get your creepy hands off me!
I have powers! I'll use them, I will!
don't worry, Sookie, I'm gonna get you out.
wait until the sun comes up.
I'll find you. Be ready.
because we're gonna need all the luck in the world, but I'm gonna get us out of here.
I'm not giving up without a fight.
you have no idea what awaits you on the other side, my beautiful bride.
no more pain.
no more fear.
no more rules.
tell me, Eric... May I call you Eric?
certainly.
what exactly is your relationship with Miss Stackhouse?
well, her lover, Bill Compton, is, um...
was a constituent of mine.
I'd keep an eye on that because I knew she was of interest to my queen.
so no personal attachments?
I do not get attached to humans.
still, you have to admit, she is quite delectable.
my tastes lie elsewhere.
Lorena thinks you killed one of my werewolves.
I killed a werewolf. I was not aware it belonged to you.
to save Sookie? To save myself.
I was at her house to question her regarding Bill's disappearance, and it attacked me.
only a very young and very foolish vampire could be killed by a werewolf. You are neither.
only a vampire with no self-respect would allow a werewolf who attacked him to remain alive.
they are base, primitive creatures, and I will freely admit that I despise them.
you're the first vampire I met who didn't feel the same way.
of course I do.
they're more dog than man. Stupider than dogs, actually.
but it seems beneficial to me to use them rather than destroy them.
how exactly do you use them?
I give them the blood.
Oh, come, now.
I know that you yourself have been dealing, so don't pretend to be a vampire fundamentalist.
if all the supernaturals would stop squabbling among themselves and unite, we could conquer humans in a matter of days.
this is your plan? - I prefer to call it my dream.
well, I like this dream.
throughout history, I have aligned myself with or destroyed those humans in power, hoping to make a dent in mankind's race to oblivion.
what other creature actively destroys its own habitat?
Hey, you're preaching to the choir.
I mean, do you remember how the air used to smell?
how humans used to smell?
how they used to taste? - I remember everything.
preening little fool that he was, Adolf was right about one thing.
there is a master race.
it's just not the human race.
should we have taken the I-12 exit?
Oh, we're not going to Shreveport.
Oh, don't worry.
we'll deal with your Magister problem in time.
well, this is my, uh, humble abode.
Wow.
it's amazing.
you think so?
and that...
that is beautiful.
that's my girl. - Tonantzin.
no, that's the Virgin Mary.
Yeah, but it's also...
Eleggua and Chango.
these guys are pretty fucking hard-core, dude.
what do you offer them?
lafayette, man, these guys, they have to be appeased, bro, or else they will fuck you up.
seriously, I sing for Eleggua.
I put out shots of tequila for Chango.
he drink 'em? - No, smart-ass.
he blesses 'em, and then I drink them.
well, maybe I should put out a couple of shots for him right now.
or...
we could offer him something else.
evening, faggot.
bitch.
first your fucking non-American car, faggot.
we gonna fuck you up, cocksucker.
Yeah, fucker.
shit.
last time you fuck with me.
dumb-ass hillbilly.
make no mistake, cracker.
you're gonna get my fucking ride fixed.
how the hell am I supposed...? - Ain't my fucking problem.
why don't you just sell all that shit I dropped by your house?
I ain't selling no vampire blood. It's evil.
and crystal meth ain't?
calm down, man. You got him.
get the fuck out of here.
go tell your mama two faggots whupped your ass, bitch!
come on.
are you a drug dealer?
Yeah.
and V?
man, that shit's so intense, it ruins most people's lives.
you know what, man?
just take me back to my car.
whatever you want, bitch.
Ludis! Another hundred dollars.
Hadley, Ludis, go down to the Circle K.
get me a couple hundred more Deuces Wild tickets.
mama's feeling lucky tonight.
mama couldn't be more wrong.
you killed my guards. - Only a handful.
the rest were surprisingly unwilling to die for you and have defected.
Hadley?
your human is safe.
I'm not here to needlessly slaughter.
what do you want? - You, my darling Sophie Anne.
I want you to accept my proposal of marriage.
I've turned you down countless times.
why would I accept now?
because in addition to never touching you,
I will settle all your debts.
Oh, come on.
the Magister will eventually determine it was you who was selling our blood.
I've already pinned it on Eric Northman.
is that really all you've got?
well, uh, ooh, there's the IRS.
the American Vampire League will let them put you in prison, make an example of you, assuage the right wing's fears about vampires running Wall Street.
they have no dominion over me.
I'm a queen.
please.
I have known some of the finest queens who've ever lived. You, my dear girl, are no queen.
go fuck yourself.
no, sweetheart. You go fuck yourself.
Oh, I am older and stronger than you.
I only submitted to you in the past because of respect.
but you framed me.
so I renounce any and all allegiance to you.
I am his now.
I refuse to grant you...
I will rip your head off and throw it in the pool.
and I will have fun doing it.
your call.
very well, then. - Eric.
so yes or no?
goddamn it. - Oh, splendid.
sun will be up soon.
we'll spend the day here.
we'll stop by Fangtasia on our way back to Jackson.
as you wish.
I hope I didn't overstep any boundaries just now.
no, I, uh...
I quite enjoyed that.
thank you.
it is my honor and my duty...
my king.
I'll make sure your betrothed is properly restrained.
Hadley! I want my Hadley!
you should go to ground.
and not be with you when the life flows out of you?
I cannot.
and what will you do then?
find another man that you deem honorable?
so that you can turn him into a violent, hateful thing like yourself, destroying whatever it was you loved about him to begin with?
Yes, it's all my fault, isn't it?
you never enjoyed killing those humans, writhing naked in their blood, making love to me as the light died in their eyes. Oh, no.
I forced you to do all that. - No. You did not.
be a man... ...
and admit you liked it.
just as you liked enticing all those starving men with your flesh, luring them into your maker's clutches so that he could murder them, and defile their bodies in unspeakable ways as you watched.
I am not Istn. - Really?
he made you his mirror, just as you tried to make me yours.
he is the reason that a girl who once marveled in the beauty of all life, now delights in bringing pain and horror to every moment.
you never embraced our nature.
your nature was never mine.
I welcome death.
because only then will I be truly free of the disease that is you.
come on, Peaches.
we gotta get us some.
Oh, sorry, ma'am.
we kind of thought you would've retired for the day.
aren't you supposed to be patrolling the grounds?
Yeah, well, we was just gonna keep an eye on your prisoner for you, make sure he didn't get away.
Really?
and I suppose feasting on his blood never crossed your minds.
it's my fault, ma'am.
I begged Coot to let me get some.
and I got a bone to pick with this asshole.
he jumped me last night, killed three of my wolves last week.
come on.
let us just have a little taste.
it's just going to waste all over the floor like that.
of course.
suck whatever's left - right out of him. - Fuck, yeah!
drink directly from the source, right?
Oh, fuck.
this is for Louie, fanger.
and Darryl.
and Jimmy.
this is just 'cause I fucking feel like it.
you mind? I'm trying to eat here.
Oh, come on, baby.
let's turn this here dead man into a fucking raisin.
Yeah.
that is simply not true.
you can't hypnotize away the facts, Miss Flanagan.
rep. David Finch R-Louisiana, 8th District
ratification would send a bad message to our nation's children.
it would be tantamount to full-on government endorsement of deviant vampiric behavior.
the American people are too smart for this fear-mongering.
it's not fear-mongering. - Please.
we have all seen that leaked fundraising presentation which outlines an aggressive strategy that's designed to capitalize on fear and misinformation.
Oh, yeah. It's all a vast right-wing conspiracy.
it's no accident at claims of how we intend to prey on America's children...
thanks for letting me crash here last night.
you gonna tell me what the hell's going on between you and Joe Lee?
why he came after you last night?
you scared of him?
I ain't scared of him.
I just hate him.
he's a drunk.
gambles away any money we ever get.
fuck him.
he the one scarred you up? - He wishes.
don't lie to me, Tommy. - I ain't lying.
he ain't never laid a hand on me. He knows better.
well, there's something messed up between you and him.
now, you may not wanna talk about it, but we're gonna talk about it.
okay.
but I'll talk about it when I'm ready.
fair enough, long as it's today.
good morning.
I brought y'all a mess of my secret-recipe corn fritters fried in bacon grease.
you ain't had good till you've had these, Sam.
Oh, well, thank you, Melinda.
when you gonna start calling me Mama?
well, soon as it starts to feel comfortable.
well, you take your time, darling.
we got a lot of road to cover, you and me.
you mind if I have a little heart-to-heart with my youngest?
it's okay.
I'll just take these fritters with me.
put 'em on the lunch menu.
you wait and see.
folks will be lining up for them, Sam.
it's okay"?
it's okay for your own mama to talk to you?
he's just looking out for me.
yeah? Well, who the hell's looking out for me and for Joe Lee?
I don't give a shit who's looking out for him.
listen to me, little boy.
you wouldn't be here if it weren't for him.
I was ready to end my pregnancy because it would take me off the circuit for too long.
it was Joe Lee who said I ought to go ahead and have you, case you turned out to be a shifter like me.
what a saint.
he wanted to use me just like he'd been using you.
that man ain't never lt me no matter what, and he could've.
you're the one that never left.
he ain't leaving because we're his goddamn meal ticket.
yeah? And what would we do without him, huh?
you ever think about that?
my back's done shot from all the years I spent in the ring.
I ain't able to work now.
you wanna just leave me to rot in an alley somewhere?
course n, Mama.
I did it till I couldn't do it anymore, and now it's your turn.
it ain't right.
the world ain't right, you selfish little shit.
without you, we ain't gonna survive. We can't do it.
Yeah, but maybe with Sam's help... - You can't trust Sam.
he may be blood, but he ain't family.
and he ain't never gonna be.
he looks down on us.
thinks he's better than us.
Yeah, well, maybe he is. - Yeah, well, maybe the fuck he is.
but you think he's willing to take care of us over the long haul once he knows the truth?
me and Joe Lee's all you got, son, all you ever will have.
and in your bones, you know that to be true.
fuck.
who the hell are you?
I'm here to see Crystal.
what for?
that's between me and Crystal.
is that so?
all right.
babe.
somebody here to see you.
Hey.
who the hell are you?
what?
crystal, it's me, Jason.
what is this, some kind of joke?
I ain't never laid eyes on you.
but...
I don't know who put you up to this or why, but I don't think it's funny.
and I'd appreciate it if you'd leave and my fiance alone.
fiance? - You heard the lady, asshole.
now, why don't you get off our land before we kick you off?
Yeah, dumb-ass.
what's taking so long? - Yeah.
Hey, bitch already said she ain't know you.
sorry, ma'am.
must have confused you with somebody else.
you showed him.
whoever the hell he was.
Hi.
you got that little blond girl in there?
what's it to you?
Talbot's serving her blood for dinner, and she's only supposed to be eating almonds.
that's what it is to me.
nobody told me about almonds.
if she ain't eating almonds, Talbot ain't gonna be happy.
if Talbot ain't happy, Russell ain't happy.
if Russell ain't happy, you dogs ain't getting any vampire blood.
now open up the goddamn door.
great. You fell asleep and let her escape?
no.
what the hell are you doing?
killing vampires and saving your ass.
I'll fill you in later. Now let's get the hell out of here.
eggs over easy, sausage, white toast.
and he wants them eggs runny, not...
I know what over easy mean, goddamn it.
well, you're in a sorry mood today.
that's right, I am in a fucking sorry-ass mood.
you got a fucking problem with that?
no.
Hey, Arlene, have you seen Tommy?
no, and I got two tables need busing.
Oh, and, Sam?
I thought you had a no-pet policy on those apartments you rent...
I do. - Oh, I see.
unless it's your kinfolk?
I don't appreciate you letting them have that dog when Coby and Lisa can't have a hamster.
what dog?
that mean-ass looking pit bull that your mama and daddy brought out and piled into their van this morning.
like you don't know.
I got kids, Sam. I can't be having some killer dog...
damn, everybody's ignoring me today.
goddamn it.
he's got werewolves patrolling the grounds by day.
but if we can get to one of his cars, hotwire it...
I've gotta find Bill. - What?
he was covered in blood. He was gonna let them kill me.
I ain't risking my life to save his dead ass, and neither should you.
he may not be dead, and they forced him to do that.
that's not who he is.
I am not leaving here without him.
then you're a fucking idiot.
just find us a way out of here.
thanks for getting here so fast. - What the hell's the goddamn emergency?
well, listen.
I need to know if there is any dogfighting in Renard Parish.
hell, no. We don't allow that.
what about nearby?
I can't share official intra-parish intelligence with civilians.
Andy, lives are at stake.
and speaking of, I already saved your sorry ass once, so you owe me.
I heard about some raids over in Union Parish recently, down towards the north end of Bernice.
okay, thanks, buddy.
Hey, Arlene, get the sheriff anything he wants for breakfast, on the house.
where the hell'd you learn to drive, Sam Merlotte?
QB ONE
get out of the vehicle, please.
what?
get out of the fucking vehicle, boy.
don't make me say it again.
Hey, you can't... - Ma'am, nobody's talking to you.
I'm gonna give you one last chance to get out of the vehicle before I start to get mad.
what the fuck, dude?
I'll tell you what the fuck!
Oh, my God.
ma'am, you wanna keep it quiet?
careful, that's my throwing arm.
you should have thought about that before you decided to engage in lewd behavior in public, which, in case you didn't know, is against the law.
you ain't no fucking cop, man.
not yet, but I'm gonna be one real soon.
and I got my eye on you.
I ain't doing nothing you never did yourself.
yeah? But here's the difference between you and me.
something about you is wrong.
and when I find out what that is, I'm gonna fuck you up good, boy.
you got it? - I got it. Fuck.
good.
now get the fuck out of here.
fucking freak.
you got that right.
this is fucking intense.
this is how it's always gonna be with me, baby.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God. You taste like fucking life itself.
I would do anything for you.
will you take me to 4-Ever Young and buy me anything I want?
better. I'll steal it for you.
I love you, you fucking lunatic.
not more than I love you, you hot bitch.
hotter than hell.
hottest bitch in town, and I fucking own you.
trash.
fuck.
don't be afraid.
I'm not one of them, I swear.
I'm a good guy. - What do you want?
I'm looking for Sookie Stackhouse.
you got a car?
Yeah.
please, say something.
please, don't be dead.
not after everything we've been through.
I won't let you go, I won't.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I'm gonna make you well if it's the last thing I ever do.
because I love you, Bill Compton, and I am not about to let you go.
well, isn't that heartwarming?
this is all your fault.
back off. - Keep out of this.
I don't take orders from vamps.
get away from her. ???
Tara, he saved her life.
after he almost fucking killed her.
you're alive. Sweet jesus. - Is everything okay there?
Yeah, she had a nightmare.
say something.
you brain damaged?
I-- I need to speak to bill,
alone.
so he can finish what he started?
hell, no. - Tara.
everyone, please.
y'all heard her.
out.
you're afraid of me.
can you blame me?
I never meant to hurt you.
I couldn't stop.
I know.
I can't take back what I've done.
no,
you can't.
I don't know how to start forgiving you.
don't know if I ever will.
there's too much.
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.
I don't wanna be forgiven.
from the day we met,
it's been one long,
bloody fight.
and I keep waiting for it to be over,
for us to be happy,
to start our lives together
like a normal couple.
but it's never gonna happen for us, is it? - I want you to have all that.
I want you to lie in the sunlight.
have children.
grow old with someone.
I want you to have the life you deserve.
and I cannot give it to you.
I love you, Sookie Stackhouse.
and I will love you forever.
I love you too.
be safe.
this isn't a room,
it's a fucking closet.
where am I supposed to put my birds?
Hadley! - You never said she was going to live with us.
she's my wife, Talbot.
we just acquired the state of louisiana.
I thought you would've been excited.
excited?
Franklin's brains won't wash off the guest linens.
I had to bury werewolves under the gazebo.
and that Sookie bitch staked Lorena.
I've had enough excitement, thank you.
they made quite a mess, didn't they?
well,
at least you're safe.
that's what matters most to me.
words.
Oh, things may be getting complicated soon.
I'm afraid I acted somewhat impulsively while I was gone.
what did you do?
spit it out.
I killed the magister.
he deserved it.
are you out of your fucking mind?
the authority will never stand for it-- - Fuck the authority.
they won't be able to prove a thing. I made sure of that.
you're acting like a century-Old child. - Relax!
I've already sent a half million dollar check to the avl
in support of their foolish vampire rights amendment.
you can't buy your way out of erything. - Of course I can.
this is america.
forgive the interruption, your majesty.
there's a were-Bitch in your study.
go,
while I babysit your wife.
what's up, pumpkin - They killed my cooter. - Oh, he died a hero.
he weren't no hero.
he just wanted to do some v and have a little fun.
and they shot him in the heart.
let me go after them.
I'll rip their fucking heads off!
I like your energy.
what do you think, Northman?
well, I enjoy a good head-Ripping as much as the next vampire.
but in this case, it might be wise to consider the value
of the heads in question.
you mean the stackhouse girl?
Yeah, she's something special,
isn't she?
she fucked my ex-Boyfriend and made him shoot my fianc
she's a cunt.
but she's a special cunt.
Ah, don't worry, darling.
I'll let you play with her first.
go.
respectfully, your majesty,
given the recent turn of events,
bringing Sookie into this may not be the best idea.
well, that's exactly why I need her.
I may have inadvertently started a war tonight.
miss Stackhouse could be my secret weapon.
well, Sookie's abilities are unpredictable at best.
and like most humans, she's ruled by petty emotions.
I would not trust her.
??? Can I trust you?
you turned on your own queen.
and now that I've freed your feisty little ward
how do I know you won't sell me out as well?
because I have been searching for you for a thousand years.
a true leader.
one strong enough to unite us all.
I believed my maker, Godric, Was such a vampire, but he was...
weak.
he succumbed to his humanity, and it killed him.
dispatching the magister, that proved without a doubt that my search...
it has finally ended.
that was rash and foolish.
it was brave and uncompromising.
vampires have yearned for someone to stand up,
to the tyranny of the authority for centuries.
just give me the chance.
and I will show you
just how deep my loyalty runs.
Papa's going buy you a diamond ring?
when's papa gonna buy mama a diamond ring?
that's what I wanna know.
don't you worry, ch
I'll take real good care of our baby.
Oh, no, you're dead.
they buried you.
death can't keep me from my boy.
you're gonna finish what your daddy started,
ain't you, petit boug?
gonna be just like your old man, you.
no.
he ain't gonna be nothing like you.
you get away from us.
I'm in his blood, boo.
ain't nothing you can do about that.
Arlene! Wake up, wake up.
you're dreaming, baby.
Oh, I never thought i'd miss you, but i totally did.
all right.
there's some stuff that I gotta tell you,
but you gotta promise me you won't get mad.
Jessica, there's no time for this.
you must collect your things and leave immediately.
where we going? - We're not going anywhere.
but-- - Look at me.
as your maker,
I release you.
well, what's that supposed to mean?
it means our ties are broken. You are free to go.
well, but, uh, - What if i don't wanna be released? - You can't stay with me.
well, I ain't going anywhere. No way.
listen to me. - No, you listen to me.
I drained someone.
I know, I was hungry and I was sad,
and it was an accident. But I didn't know how to control myself.
because you never taught me.
no, I need you. You are the only maker I've got. - I can't take care of you!
I can't protect you!
I'm no good to you.
well, I'm no good either.
and I don't care what you say, I am not leaving.
I don't wanna be alone anymore.
I don't wanna talk about it.
okay.
if you need to get back to Jackson,
I understand.
I'll be fine.
Sookie, I know you're tougher than a one-Eared alley cat.
but I ain't leaving you alone right now.
besides, I reckon jackson won't be too friendly tonight.
there's a guest room upstairs.
you're welcome to it for as long as you need.
someday it won't hurt so bad.
is that what you keep telling yourself about debbie?
Andy, what are you doing here?
just because I let bill give you his blood,
don't mean I forgive him.
Sook, you need to press charges.
what he did to you, that's domestic...
something. - Actually, it sounds more like assault or attempted murder.
I'm not gonna press charges on bill.
your brother's just trying to look out for you.
I know, but bill didn't attack me on purpose.
he was starving and unconscious.
it's his nature. - That's no excuse.
it's over between me and Bill.
there's nothing more to talk about.
maybe now is not the time.
if you change your mind, we can get a restraining order.
no, screw the restraining order.
if he come near you again, I'm gonna kill him, - I swear. - You ain't killing nobody.
stop looking at me. She's gonna hear what i'm thinking.
don't lose your shit on me. Shut up, brain.
stop thinking. She's gonna find out.
Jason. Find out what?
what have you done?
nothing.
you got no right being in my head.
that's trespassing.
I do so have a right.
if you're gonna come into my house
threatening to kill people and lying to me.
fine. I'll leave.
somebody's gotta make that fanger pay for what he did to you. - That fanger?
Jason, that's not who you are.
that's now how gran raised you.
you ain't a bigot or a murderer.
I know you love me
and you're just trying to protect me,
but I have seen enough killing and hating.
I can't take any more.
please just tell me you ain't gonna do anything stupid.
you ever gonna tell me what happened to you?
someday.
just not tonight.
well, hooker, I need to know.
you got a death wish?
no.
I don't.
I fought like a motherfucker to survive.
never realized how much I wanted to live till...
I can't go there right now, Lafayette.
okay.
you ain't got to go nowhere.
you just stay right here with me.
get in here before someone sees you.
make sure that's everything.
because you ain't welcome back here, you understand?
I want you boys to know i don't blame you.
I'd leave us too if I could.
and what's stopping you?
that son of a bitch done nothing but knock you up and
suck you dry.
that son of a bitch is your daddy.
and he's my husband.
I know he's no good.
but love don't discriminate.
that's why
you can hate me if you want,
but I'll still love you.
both of y'all.
as long as i'm still breathing.
take care of my boy, Sam.
take care of yourself too.
I'm so glad y'l got each other.
well, let me help you with that.
I'm stronger than I look.
I believe it.
but if you wanna help,
I could really use some money.
I know I got no right to ask,
but JoeLee done spent every cent we had on that fight.
that ain't gonna get us far.
I don't give a fuck where it gets you as long as it's out of here.
motherfuck.
and now you can fly too.
ain't you fancy?
mama, how you get out the hospital? And what are you doing here?
hell, I came to protect you. They coming for you.
who? Who coming for me, mama?
the vampires,
the witches.
the dogs and the cats, they know.
they all know.
and they are coming for you, baby.
but I got here.
I got here.
Hey. - Hi.
you wanna be alone?
no.
I used to do this all the time.
just lie in the sun
till the whole world faded away.
and your gran would yell about you putting on sunscreen.
you're frying like a fritter in a pan.
my whole life's at night now.
you gonna go back to Bill again?
no one's ever hurt me so bad.
I trusted him
with every part of me.
maybe it's stupid to trust someone that much.
you didn't ask for any of this.
I knew what he was the minute I laid eyes on him.
I knew he was dangerous.
and I ain't gonna lie,
that's part of what i fell in love with.
bill gave you his blood before your first date.
he saved my life.
we both know what drinking their blood does to you.
maybe he glamoured you into thinking you were in love. - Glamouring doesn't work on me.
it might be over between me and Bill,
but what we had was real.
and I can't just flip a switch
and turn my heart off.
you--? You know what you sound like?
one of those sad country songs about dumb bitches,
who let their men cheat and beat on them all for the sake of true love.
let me tell you something.
at the end of those songs,
the dumb bitches always end up dead.
did you just call me a dumb bitch? - I'm sorry, but if you go back to that vampire,
that's what you are.
what I can do in my brain,
it's every bit as deadly as bill's fangs.
I know what it's like to be afraid of my own body,
to not be sure what it's gonna do next.
I've killed.
I may not have cheated, but I wanted to.
me and Bill, we ain't so different.
Yes, you are.
I saw the look in his eye.
???
cold and crazy.
like a rattlesnake.
that isn't the Bill I know.
then maybe you don't know the real Bill.
I don't wanna fight with you.
you've been through a lot. I can see you're in pain.
let's talk about it.
I can't.
because trust me, Sook,
you don't wanna hear what I've gotta say.
morning, Tara.
good.
maybe you can flirt some sense into that girl,
because logic sure as hell ain't working.
hold on.
Yeah, I'm coming.
goddamn it.
let me unlock the goddamn
I need your truck.
what happened to your face?
come right in.
what did you do, swim here?
it was the only way they couldn't track my scent.
what, is that drug dealer code for something?
listen, I don't wanna cause you no trouble,
but I had no other place to go.
all's I need is your truck. - My truck.
Yeah, I heard you.
but, Crystal, you ain't getting my truck
until you tell me what happened to your face.
can I get a towel?
and some whiskey?
got any of those tru bloods?
Oh! Motherfucker!
that's tara. She's all bark and
well, she bites too.
but at least she ain't a vampire like our hostess.
chili's down in monroe had a vampire bus boy.
he's real fast.
well, seems like you're gonna fit in just great around here.
now, this is nice place to work. Don't let nobody tell you different.
you mean all the dead waitresses?
I heard.
but I figure, world's been around long enough.
no matter where you step, somebody's died there.
what an interesting way to look at it.
besides, I got two kids to feed.
this recession and all,
can't afford being picky.
I got two kids too.
Lisa and Coby.
and the one on the way?
you have a name yet?
how'd you know?
Hey, Arlene.
who's this?
this is Holly, your new waitress. - Oh.
all right.
hey-- It's okay.
it's okay, it's just me.
Tara, it's okay.
it's okay.
I've been promised to Felton since I was 4.
four years old?
is that even legal?
case you hadn't noticed, We don't care much for the law in hotshot.
well, Does it like a church or cult or something?
because I've done that,
and they washed my brain.
daddy says god's just a drug, like meth or whiskey.
does he did this to your face?
after you came and saw me.
what? This--?
all of these resulted from me?
because I told him I weren't gonna marry him no more.
Oh, great.
I mean, not great that he punched you in the face.
great that you ain't getting married.
Goddamn. What is it about you, Crystal?
why do you make me feel this way?
what way?
like I'm home.
I gotta to leave. Give me your keys. - No.
but you said-- - No.
if you wanna go...
...I'll drive you anyplace you want.
but I think you wanna stay with me,
and you're just scared.
you don't know them.
they don't know me.
moms, I done told you, ain't nobody coming for me.
who knocking, then? - That ain't for me, mama.
trust me.
Jesus.
you got a lot of people real worried, Ruby Jean.
that white bitch say, "sit there. I'll be right back.
you showed her.
I gotta pee, jesus.
uh...
one of our new nurses left your mother in the garden.
it won't happen again.
for what I pay that place,
it better not.
come in, please.
thank you for coming on your day off.
I didn't wanna call the hospital in case they-- - In case
they sent the cops?
Yeah. I guess that wouldn't be too good for your business, huh?
look, jesus, about the other night
Hey. I ain't going back there.
you ain't taking me back.
I ain't crazy. It's them drugs they're giving me.
mama. - ???
you got power, boy.
you always have.
that's why they're coming.
I got to protect you,
but I can't do it if you keep drugging me.
mama, - Do not touch me.
you're right.
your son is very powerful.
but I'm not gonna let anything happen to him.
okay?
just give me the knife.
let's watch some TV.
thank you.
TV's all faggots and murderers and ho's, Jesus.
where the clicker?
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I need you to deliver a message to your cousin.
I ain't seen Sookie since
tell her exactly what I say, and nothing more.
Janice, listen to me. Stay there, call Dad.
I'm on my way.
goddamn it. - Debbie?
she and her pack of Were trash burned down my sister's salon.
it's one thing coming after me, it's a whole other thing going after my family.
none of this would've happened if you hadn't helped.
Debbie was crazy long before you came around.
I just gotta find her before she goes after anyone else I love.
sorry, Sookie. I gotta go.
of course. They're your family. Don't be sorry.
should come with me.
no.
Yeah, but you
I am not gonna spend my life running.
that's not a life.
Russell and his wolves will come back for you at any time.
look, you need to call somebody to come stay with you.
your brother, that sheriff.
my brother and Andy wouldn't stand a chance against Russell.
I can't let anyone else get hurt because of me.
I ain't leaving you here alone.
if I'm in danger, Bill will come.
sure about that? - Yes.
you can read minds and shoot light out of your fingers.
who am I to tell you what's best for you?
if I knew what was best for me,
I would have fallen in love with someone like you.
back at you.
it's too bad we're so stupid, huh?
I'm glad I met you, Sookie Stackhouse.
you take care of yourself, you hear?
You'll-? You'll come back and see me sometime?
you can bet on it.
keep your eye on Tara. If she needs anything, get it.
she starts yelling or throwing drinks, come and find me.
sounds like my kind of girl.
don't you flirt with her, either.
she your girlfriend or something?
she ain't my girlfriend. She's just going through some stuff that's none of your business.
is Jessica Hamby working tonight?
give it a rest, man. She's way out of your league.
who the hell are you?
you're in my family's establishment, so you listen to me when I tell you Jessica's done with you.
she's moving on to a real man.
you wanna pick a fight, you might want to do it with somebody your own size.
what do you say? Wanna take this outside?
Yes. Hey, hey, hey
nobody's taking nothing nowhere.
Hey. Hoyt, I apologize for my brother.
Tara, get him a drink on the house, please.
in my office. Now.
I hate that dick.
Hoyt's not a dick.
and whatever's going on between him and Jessica,
I want you stay out of it.
you ain't my father, so
right, I ain't Joe Lee. I care about you.
I don't wanna see you get hurt.
I could take that big crybaby with both my hands tied behind my back.
Tommy. Look, I know it's been a fight for you up until now, but it don't have to be that way no more.
all right, so how about you just give trouble a rest for a while and focus on building a future for yourself?
what are you talking about?
well, Merlotte's was my dream.
I want you to start thinking about one of your own.
get some money saved up.
you know, you go to college, make something of your life.
college?
you really don't know me at all, do you?
that was much better.
I'm getting fast, aren't I?
Yeah, but werewolves are faster.
you really think they're coming for you?
or Sookie.
or both of us.
well, why aren't you with her, then?
because she doesn't want me to be.
if she needs me, I will know it.
all right, she screwed up your proposal, I get it.
but the whole time she was looking for you, she was wearing your ring.
Jessica, it's over.
no way. - Way.
but you love her.
I do.
which is why I have to let her go.
I love Hoyt.
but he's so good and sweet.
he deserves to be with somebody who deserves him.
I'm sorry.
it sucks.
who's there?
Hadley? Oh, my God.
where have you been?
Is-? Is Gran here?
I should've called, and said I was sorry for running away from that rehab.
none of that matters anymore.
you're right.
gran is fine wherever she is.
we're the ones who are fucked.
I didn't come here to visit.
I've got a message for you from Eric Northman.
how do you know Eric?
what's he done to you?
nothing too bad yet.
but if I don't tell you this exactly, it ain't gonna be pretty.
tell me what?
Russell is coming for you.
don't trust Bill.
Oh, and I'm supposed to trust Eric?
what does all this have to do with you, anyway?
I've gotta go.
Hadley, wait.
you can't just leave like this.
I've got to. And so should you. They're coming.
Russell was powerful enough to kidnap Bill, and God knows what he's got on Eric.
if he wants me, he's gonna find me, no matter where I run.
Sookie, if they find you, they're gonna do horrible things.
I'm so sorry. I hope one day you can forgive me.
forgive you for what?
I'm the one who told them about you. All my fault.
go ahead, leave, like you've been doing for centuries, chasing after this or that while I sit here alone.
in a giant mansion with all the blood you can drink and all the vampire boys you could possibly want.
Oh, poor Talbot.
are your diamond slippers chafing?
first the queen, now a telepath?
all you care about's your precious collection.
Oh.
your Majesty.
perhaps I have a solution.
I know I'm a poor substitute, but I would be honored to keep you company.
hm.
I don't know.
that sounds like fun.
I am positively jealous.
fine. Mr. Northman and I will try to find some way to amuse ourselves.
I've never been outside of Bon Temps.
never had no job other than cooking.
you cook?
my sister works at Merlotte's.
not food, meth.
Oh.
Jason, what am I gonna do?
if I stay here, they're gonna find me and kill you.
that ain't gonna happen.
no, no, no. That ain't gonna happen.
we're together now.
no one's gonna come between us.
that is crazy talk.
but I almost believe you.
is that your stomach growling, or you got gas?
it's my stomach.
I ain't- I ain't eaten since this morni.
Uh-huh.
tell you what. Why don't you hop in the shower?
come here. And I'll go get us something to eat.
no, Jason, I ain't staying here by myself.
it'll just be a minute.
I'll lock the door.
ain't nothing gonna happen to you.
okay? Okay.
good.
well. Well, that's pretty fine, isn't it?
I must say.
he's looking over here, huh?
can I help you?
I'm looking for my daughter.
what's your daughter's name?
her name's Crystal Norris.
blond, real pretty.
got a black eye because she's so clumsy, she walked into a wall.
well, I haven't seen anybody like that around here.
maybe it's best if you gentlemen were on your way.
I know she's been here because she took my truck and it's outside in your lot.
so quit being a fuck mouth and tell me where she is.
there a problem here, bro?
everything's fine, Tommy.
look, I don't know you, I don't know your daughter, but this is my bar, and you ain't welcome here.
listen up, shifter.
I find out you're lying to me,
I'm gonna rip your dick off, and feed it to my hogs.
Hey, hey. No, Tommy.
you heard him, Tommy.
down, boy.
you smell that?
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
she's snoring like a buzz saw.
thank you.
you told them I'm letting her spend the night?
Mm-hm.
they weren't very happy about it.
but I think it's good, you know?
she went through a lot to get here.
I think it's her way of saying that she needs you.
waving a kitchen knife is a hell of a way to say you care.
she wasn't gonna huranybody.
ruby Jean has got a flair for drama.
it runs in the family.
what she said before about you being powerful...
Mm-hm.
it's true, you know that, right?
when I was 5 years old, that woman told me
I could breathe underwater.
my little ass almost drowned.
so, no, boyfriend, I don't listen to most of what come out her mouth.
she's schizophrenic, but it doesn't mean that she's not perceptive.
look, just let me say this, then I'll get off your back, all right?
Mm-hm.
dealing drugs is very dangerous for somebody like you.
all that energy you've got, it can go dark if you let it.
I think you've been hanging around my mama too long.
her crazy is starting to rub off on you.
I'll be back in the morning to pick her up.
Jesus, wait.
the dealing, I ain't got no choice. I don't.
I've been trying to stop for a while now.
it's not that easy.
and if you don't want nothing to do with me, that's fine.
I just wanted to let you know because
checkmate.
I'm bored.
take off your clothes.
a little privacy?
everybody out.
it's been a long time since I've done this.
a man?
no, a vampire.
anybody here?
Hello?
Hey! Is anybody in-?
fuck.
who in the hell are you?
you Crystal's father? Wait, you're the guy from the
I'm the guy holding the gun.
and I'm telling you Crystal ain't never coming back here.
and you ain't never going near her again.
stupid punk.
you got no idea who you're messing with.
no, you got no idea.
I'm a cop, and I know what you're up to.
so you're gonna leave Crystal the fuck alone.
or me and the whole sheriff's department gonna come after you, illbilly freak show.
you feel me?
Oh, yeah. I feel you, boy.
hi
open up, little piggy.
or I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house down.
I don't wanna kill you, but I will.
I got nothing left to live for anyway.
you took it all.
you brought this on yourself, Debbie.
take another step and I will shoot.
why don't you just pull the trigger now?
what do you care? There's people that love you for reasons I ain't even gonna try to make sense of.
Wow.
talking to me about love.
how noble and shit. Bitch, please.
I see right through you.
you fuck vampires and werewolves because your own kind rejects you.
they know you're nothing but a freak.
I've had vampire blood. Lots of it.
me too.
your boyfriend's yummy.
Hey. Get back here.
Jessica, stay in the house.
since no one was hospitable enough to invite me in, - I had to wait till you came out. - Help.
I take it this is yours.
let her go.
what do you think, Gus? Should I let her go?
Oh.
well, I take it that's a no.
I'll tell you what.
I'll trade you the red one for the blond one.
how about you and I settle this among men?
Oh, how very sexist of you, Bill.
when it comes to killing,
I have always been an equal opportunist.
you are 3000 years old and a king, yet you hide behind guards...
...wolves...
...a baby vampire.
you a coward...
...or are you just lazy?
here you go, boy - Rip her to shreds. - No.
Northman was right about you.
you are a waste of the blood.
silver spurs. You like?
turn over.
Oh, yes, Daddy.
Russell took my family.
now I take his. - No!
Yes.
No!
get out of my house, bitch!
fuck you.
next time I won't miss.
I love you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I love you.
I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.
I love you.
I'm sorry. Please don't kill me. I don't wanna die.
relay this message to your king...
it is Antonia Gavilde Logro?
and I am returned.
what is your business with Antonia?
resurrection.
he's a medium!
you have the magic.
what the fu... - Shh...
do you remember the last 24 hours at all?
got what you came for, right? So, go...
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't forget that.
Oh, fucking hell.
I don't care how it happened!
it fucking happened!
I want you gone forever.
we welcome you into our land...
she's slipping away from me.
Jason. - Is this a dream?
it'll kill me, if I lose her.
I'm barely hangin' on to my own life.
I do not want to be responsible for yours, too.
I can avenge our torment...
but I cannot do it alone.
what do I have to do?
alert every vampire in your area. They will do as we do...
bind ourselves with silver to keep us in our coffins.
there's a witch spell comin'...
it's supposed to make all the vampires walk out into the sun.
Oh, Jesus.
the sun!
the sun!
No! No!
Oh my God.
you just saved my life.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no. Bucky.
I got her.
thank you.
did I do that?
you were not yourself.
his family?
they will be well compensated.
all the guards know the dangers inherent in their job.
but I knew his little girl.
Jessica, you were spellbound.
you did not kill Bucky.
the witch Antonia did.
we need to get her back in the cell.
they may have only temporarily broken the spell in the hope that we drop our guard.
we will not be safe until nightfall.
he's right.
I don't want to die.
I don't want you to die, either.
I gotcha.
I'm so sorry, Jess.
I know it hurts.
please make sure it is secure.
I clearly underestimated her strength earlier.
better for a little pain now, than to be able to escape again if the necromancer resumes her sorcery.
think good things.
hot summer days, barbecuin'...
uh, no. Um...
good things a vampire would think of.
the moon.
never gettin' cold. Tru-Blood.
Yup? We will be indebted to you forever, but right now Jessica and I need to get some rest, if only for a few minutes.
we need to regain our strength.
all right.
I realize, as a law enforcement officer, that you might feel the need to report this, but vampires killing humans is not something that I can afford to have documented.
not to mention...
Yeah.
it's probably for the best, that I don't report that.
it's also probably for the best that nobody has to know anything about your boy that I shot outside.
in the shoulder.
Unquestionably.
you won't want to make any sudden movements when they enter.
Freeze! - Man down.
put your hands up where we can see 'em! Now!
now, my source didn't know why the vampires and witches would want a war, or who started it.
and personally, I don't fuckin' care.
but here's what I think.
those witches are fuckin' idiots for gettin' mixed up in vampire shit.
did you tell him?
of course not.
because those dead fuckers are hardcore.
they will kill you and not blink an eye.
even we're no match for 'em.
yo, speak for yourself.
yo, don't be a fuckin' moron!
dumb ass.
you don't think a vampire wouldn't rip you to pieces in a heartbeat?
I'd fuckin' put up a fight at least.
no, you wouldn't. You would be dead.
wouldn't fight nothin'.
it might hurt our pride to admit that, but it'll save our lives and the lives of this pack, which is why this pack will stay the fuck out of it.
unless you want to go it on your own, hot dog.
I'd like to see that.
Luna, it's me.
which one of you?
the one who just kicked my little brother out of my life for good.
is that supposed to make me feel better?
it's not supposed to make you feel anything.
I just wanted to let you know.
I wish you would have told me your brother was a skinwalker.
I wish I would have known.
who did, who did he...
our mother and father.
I'm not gonna lie to you, they deserved it.
they abused him his whole life.
they fought him in dog fights.
Oh my God.
Yeah. And you want to know something else?
I could forgive him for killing our folks, but I can't forgive him for what he did to you.
I can't.
Hey, Emma.
my Barbie who's a pony likes you, but my Barbie who's a cat doesn't like you.
she doesn't like anybody. - Oh.
you should hear how Cat Barbie feels about yours truly.
I could use some help makin' dinner.
no. Sam's playing with me.
and by help, I mean playing with Emma.
nothin' would make me happier.
Hey, Emma.
let's see if we can get Cat Barbie to like me.
you can try, but she won't.
yank it off, it's better.
Oh. Well, won't it pull some of you off with it?
Yeah, but that's okay.
it doesn't hurt as much as the silver, and it heals faster.
thank, thank you.
but, you said it would heal faster.
Yeah.
I'm just realizing I haven't fed since my faerie godmother?
right.
you want a Tru-Blood?
Oh, no. Tru-Blood isn't gonna help with this.
uh, I just need a rest.
you need to feed.
there is no one.
there's me.
please don't say this if you don't mean it.
I do mean it.
now, you know my blood's special, like the Faerie Goddess..
just a fraction of that, and I'm trusting you not to lose control.
take something silver, hold it in your hand, and silver me should do anything unwanted.
I'm trusting you, Eric.
I won't betray you.
ever.
I may remind you of that someday.
but I'm, I'm not injured.
we will be one.
Oh my God.
where you been? I've been worried sick.
no, I know. I just had to, uh...
I had this uh, strange feelin', like I thought I lost you forever.
Hey, when was the last time you took a bath, huh?
I can't live without you.
now, I know we've been havin' problems, but I think I got that figured out, too.
Hoyt, I, uh...
I, I want to move out.
you want us to get a new place?
I think that's a great idea, 'cause we'd start over.
no. Uh...
I don't want to live together anymore.
sorry, I, I'm not, I'm not made for this. I have a...
fuck.
a hunger in the very center of me, and this, you, you and me, I can't...
it's not enough.
I wish it was, because I love you and I don't, I don't want to hurt you, but it's not enough.
it just isn't.
I'm sorry.
you don't mean that.
Hoyt, I do.
I really do. It's over.
it's...
you're too good for me.
I was too happy.
I should have known I could never be this happy.
of course you can be happy. You just...
you aren't gettin' all of me, because of what I am, and you...
you deserve someone better than me.
I don't want someone better than you. I want you!
if I can't have you, I don't want to be alive.
I need to go.
get out of my way.
I will die without you, I will.
my God, just listen to yourself!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
and I'm sorry that I said that your blood is shit. It's not!
it's not, and I, I will drink it every day if you want.
but love me.
please, please, please love me.
if you don't love me, I will die.
then die!
God, you are so fuckin' hot when you got blood all over you.
stop it.
I want you to bite me and fuck me at the same time.
right here.
okay. - Yeah.
come to daddy.
yeah?
I'm Rita. I'm a donor. The King sent me down for you.
Yeah, sure.
thank you.
dead vampire.
should I call the coroner or sanitation?
bet you it's gonna rain tonight.
I can always feel it where that panther tore my throat open.
what up, Andy?
so you're back on the force now?
got here as fast as I could. Rosie said there was a vampire suicide?
wasn't a suicide.
Yeah, I know that.
no evidence. Searched her house, no note.
Yeah, can you believe it?
Beulah Carter was a goddamn vampire.
Oh, no. Andy.
Andy! Whoa.
you serious? You would eat a pile of dead vampire Beulah Carter?
Mmm. - Off the ground?
you are one sad, sorry freak, bubba.
get a fucking grip!
Jesus, tits, and God America, Jason.
what the fuck is happenin' to me?
I'm only good on the V, dude.
it's the only time I ever feel like I'm not watchin' myself not livin' up to people's expectations, and hatin' those people for havin' expectations, and thinkin' about hittin' 'em in the head with a bat.
uh, sorry, man. I stopped listenin' about halfway through.
so, no one in the neighborhood knew she was a vampire.
I must say I did wonder about her. - Mmm-hmm.
she kept to herself, like a vampire would. - Mmm.
or a serial killer. Ooh.
hmm.
that's the most famous vampire in town right there.
wonder if he knew she was one of his own.
Mrs. Fortenberry.
vampire Bill.
did you know Beulah Carter was a vampire?
because all of us vampires know each other?
uh, are, are vampire suicides common?
sadly, yes.
many vampires feel alone and confused, programmed to despise themselves by all the hateful and incendiary anti-vampire rhetoric in the media.
Ooh, that's good. Can I get you to say that again?
of course. I actually have a statement prepared.
Oh, I don't know if I can take a statement.
I am very telegenic.
this will get a lot of play.
it's an excellent opportunity for you to impress your producers with your eye for great TV.
Lenny, can we get a really good tight shot of him, and make sure you really play up the eyes.
it's a miracle.
what is?
you.
your blood.
it's amazing.
so is yours.
it's snowing.
why is there a bed?
can we make love in it?
like maybe never stop.
why would we ever want to?
bill, why would a vampire commit suicide?
well, see uh, I can only guess that the pervasive anti-vampire hatred that has persisted since the heinous crime perpetrated by Russell Edgington - had something to do with it. - Mmm.
and that hate is a powerful force, but hate never wins out.
not in the long run.
and we will never succumb to it.
as Christ himself said,
here, here. Let me, let me show you.
so that is it?
a single vampire dies four centuries ago!
all vampires within twenty miles burned!
wait a minute.
you made that vampire go out into the daylight.
we did, Tara. We did.
so we're not just protecting ourselves, we're actually killing vampires.
killing them is the only way to protect ourselves.
at least in my time, they remained hidden.
now they walk among us, shameless in their lust, their hunger.
they laugh at the miracle of life.
we must restore the sacred power of creation to this wounded earth.
that is our only hope.
snuff them out!
once and for all!
nothin' would make me happier than to see those dead fucks gone for good.
I can empower you.
I can teach you.
moon Goddess Emporium.
Uh-huh.
what are you doing there?
what do you want, Bill?
to speak to Antonia Gavilan de Logrono.
she's on.
lady Antonia.
vampire.
on behalf of all vampires in Louisiana and throughout the world,
I apologize for what was done to you.
it was a crime of unspeakable magnitude, for which there can be no forgiveness.
but there can, I believe, be peace between us.
peace?
what peace? One of you came here to Marnie's place of worship.
you molested her.
you bit her like an animal.
I know.
I sent him, and it was a tragic mistake.
one I deeply regret.
it was a mistake borne out of arrogance, and ignorance of who you were.
it does not matter who I am.
every soul is entitled to live freely.
you are an affront to God when you deny that.
I can only tell you that there are many of us who believe as you do.
and we wield considerable power among our kind.
Oh.
Oh, the rulers of vampires, they are my allies?
I understand your doubt.
let us meet. Just the two of us.
in peace. Unarmed.
and let you bewitch me like you did Marnie?
I can only glamour humans.
you are far beyond that.
I know what I am asking, for you to trust in the possibility of peace.
I realize how difficult that is after all that you have experienced, but it's the only way for us to avoid so much useless death, for both our kinds.
where?
the cemetery in Bon Temps.
midnight.
I am in your debt.
we can go.
Oh, hey there, Miss Fortenberry.
ma'am, this an official crime scene. I can't let...
don't you ma'am me, Andy Bellefleur.
I taught you in vacation Bible school.
actin' like you don't even know who I am.
ready to go?
not yet.
I like being here.
I think I made some friends tonight.
couple of really nice bitches.
feels like I belong.
well, if you belong, so do I.
I'm glad to see you here.
glad to be here.
Hey.
Yeah, I liked what you said tonight.
about stayin' out of anything involving vamps.
right. It's a no-brainer.
you'd think.
Yeah, I was a little hard on Chuck, but what good does it do to let him think he can go up against a fanger?
that dumb kid's gonna get his ass kicked enough as it is.
it's a real nice place you got here, Marcus.
Thanks.
Yeah, the backyard's gone to seed since the ex-wife moved out.
Oh, here we go! Boy's got him now.
Oh, fuck!
No!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
who the fuck do you think you are?
he's a fuckin' member of this pack, you asshole, who puts the needs of his pack above the needs of his own selfish fuckin' ego!
you ain't goin' nowhere, buddy. Not till you let go of that anger.
it's still snowing.
feels good, doesn't it?
when it melts on your skin.
but there aren't any clouds, and I can feel the sun on my face.
how could that be possible?
all is possible.
you and me, possible.
loving you, possible.
loving you, loving at all, actually.
I never thought I could after...
bill.
but here I am.
all is possible.
Terry? - What?
you can't just leave him alone like that!
what the hell am I supposed to do, darlin'?
half the Baptist church choir just came in.
you know how much food those people put away!
well, Rene's ghost could be anywhere in here.
do you see this mirror I put up here over the stove, so I can see him in it?
I ain't a complete stranger to keepin' my eye out for trouble, okay?
okay. You don't have to yell at me.
I'm not yelling. I am stressed out.
Aw, hell.
fuck this shit.
you must be Mrs...
thank you for meetin' me here. You buyin'?
uh, i can.
cause i am starvin'.
ain't nobody workin' here? Hey!
I'll be right with you, miss fortenberry!
service in this place fuckin' sucks, and you know why?
cause sam merlotte's a fuckin' asshole.
okay.
so, remind me what we agreed on.
well... - twenty per acre for ten years, - is that up front? - Twenty?
well, i, i don't remember discussing anything about...
okay, what can i get y'all tonight?
I'll have two miller tall boys, with two shots of tequila and some hot sauce.
Really? - And some crawfish fritters with ranch dressin'.
and also, some of that private stash of
Succotash that sam keeps hidden for hisself, 'Cause he's selfish.
what you want, paul? - Oh, i'm fine with my iced tea.
and don't go out back to smoke and leave my Food to dry out under the heat lamps, neither.
Yes, ma'am.
so, twenty a year, huh, for ten years?
that's two hundred grand. All up front, right?
Mrs. Fortenberry, i don't know what your son told you,
but my initial offer was up to $10, 000 an acre.
no way. You agreed to twelve.
first of all, according to the reynard parish tax assessor's office,
your property is only . 57 acres,
which means $5, 700.
second, it's on a year-To-Year basis, our option to renew.
third, a neighbor of yours,
a miss beulah carter just died, leaving an unpaid mortgage.
we could pick up her house for not much more than i'm offering you.
Mmm.
well, ain't there anything i can do to get you to sweeten the deal?
no. - Fuck.
well, Can i get a check tonight?
Yes, ma'am.
what's wrong?
Hoyt, i, - I really love you. - But?
I think we made a mistake moving in together.
I mean,
we were each other's first real relationship,
and i just think we moved too fast,
and maybe we should spend some time apart.
why don't you just tell me
the thing goin' on inside you you don't want me to know?
there's nothin'. - Bullshit.
why don't you tell me the fuckin' truth?
okay.
I am a vampire,
and i'm only just now realizing that maybe i'm not supposed to be
in a monogamous relationship.
after a year of you lettin' me think that we were happy?
we were happy.
I know there's someone else.
Aw, man. You fucked someone else?
no. - You bitch! Goddamn it, - you broke my fuckin' heart! - I never meant to hurt you!
this whole time i've been stickin' up for you!
I've been gettin' beat up for you! And you know what?
you don't deserve me.
and i sure as hell don't deserve you.
Hoyt, i... - i deserve someone who's not gonna be a fuckin' virgin for all of eternity!
Yeah. I deserve someone i can have a normal life with.
with kids.
and daylight.
and someone who's not gonna look...
at all the love that i have to offer and just say, "sorry, not good enough.
and someone who's not fuckin' dead! - Hoyt.
just get out.
Hoyt, please. - Get the fuck out.
I take back my invitation.
my mom was right all along. Maybe god really does hate fangs.
Hoyt... - and you know, So do i.
you fuckin' vampires!
fuck! Fuck you! Fuck!
wish you could stay this way forever.
then let's run away.
from everything.
and i will be this way forever.
I don't need to know who i am.
we can't just run away, those witches attacked you.
and other vampires i care about.
my king? - Yes.
your king, who released you so you could be with me.
he's good, this king.
I understand your love for him.
we have an obligation to stand by his side and fight with him.
no, the obligation is his.
as king, he has no choice.
let's just leave this place while we still can.
this is my home,
and we cannot just leave bill to die. It's not right.
there is no right, or wrong.
these are human notions. - And i am human,
mostly. And so were you, and i've never seen you as human
as you've been these past few days.
it's what i've fallen in love with.
but, you're also a warrior, and you don't run from a fight. You'd never forgive yourself.
I just want to be with you,
only you.
forever.
there's no such thing as forever.
Hey. I'm just callin' to give you a heads u
I'm gonna stop by and tuck my baby girl in, okay?
no need to call me back.
you headin' out?
Yeah, i got a foundation to pour first thing in the mornin'.
well, you two get home safe.
word is, somethin' big's goin' down tonight with the witches and vampires.
and thanks for helping me wrangle them pups tonight.
thanks for the hospitality.
you got alpha in you. You know that.
strong, but mature.
it's all about keepin' the peace, not control.
it's honorable. - Yup. That's him.
you can move up in this pack.
I ain't into the whole political thing.
okay, you got your own path.
I'm just sayin', door's open.
good night. - See you.
I think we're gonna like bein' in this pack.
Yeah, it's too soon to tell. - Oh, come on.
you remember how good things were in jackson when we were kids?
everyone looked out for each other.
bein' in a pack could be a good thing, - You know, for us both. - Maybe.
I need this, alcide.
it's a miracle i'm not dead,
you know, but i got a second chance,
and i don't want to screw it up. But you gotta help me.
of course i'll help you. - You gotta stay away from sookie.
I told you, you got nothin' to worry about.
you're a member of this pack, now,
and marcus was crystal clear.
we stay the fuck out of that vampire-Witch business.
and sookie comes with vampires.
that's just part of her baggage.
-Can't argue with that. - You promise?
you'll stay away from her?
I promise.
come on.
where my sister?
I sent her home.
just don't go in there.
my baby. I, i want my baby, me.
Mavis, please. - I buy him this doll.
I save all my monies. - ??
he's gone.
he's better off. - my baby don't be no better off!
my baby be dead!
and you, the killer of your own flesh and blood!
what kind of devil you are? You...
Mavis, there was no way we could have that... - he was alive!
I carry him. In me.
we gotta call the preacher man.
no funeral. - Why?
because it's better for everybody if nobody knows he ever existed.
better for you.
because i am negresse .
and because i'm a married man, - And i work for my wife's father. - Please, just bring me where he is.
please! Can't bear it. - Just let me hold him one last...
just let me hold him!
fuck no!
sorry to keep you waitin', and uh,
I don't have much time, so what can i do for you?
we're here to fight with you.
fight with me? - Against the witches.
Sookie, this is not your battle.
it's yours, and it's eric's, so it's mine.
she has a warrior's heart, your majesty.
she wants to fight for you, As do i.
I want peace. - But you're prepared for war.
of course. But i'm not convinced we will win.
well, war isn't about whether you think you can win,
it's about being willing to die for something you believe is worth dying for.
perhaps i'm a little less inclined to gamble with sookie's life than you are.
that is not our decision. - Thank you, eric.
and now maybe You can both look at me and allow me to speak for myself.
I can help.
I have powers. Now, granted, i may not be in perfect control of those powers,
but they've saved me and others from some pretty dire circumstances.
Sookie, you could die. - Well, call me crazy,
but i'm willing to die if it means keeping an entire group of people i know and love from being eradicated in the name of hate.
thank you. - My liege.
my...
that's cute.
daddy's mad.
who's he? - Friend of mine.
Sam merlotte. - You not get my message i was stoppin' by to tuck emma in?
I haven't checked my phone since i got home from work.
been busy makin' dinner. For some shifter you ain't told me about.
technically, you're not supposed to stop by unless i agree to it first.
Yeah, well, apparently, you're too busy cookin' for shifter sam,
which, Technically, you're supposed to tell me about
before you invited him here to your house
and introduced him to our daughter.
Hey, i just showed up, and it wasn't planned.
so, he gets to show up uninvited,
but me, the father of your daughter, does not?
I got a problem with that.
Luna, you want me to leave? - No!
you like mama's new friend, baby girl?
he's nice. He plays barbies with me.
Yeah, well, i got a feeling he plays barbies all by himself.
okay.
we are gonna get ready for bed. - Okay. - Okay.
do not start anything, marcus.
it's bad for emma, it's bad for me, it's bad for you.
cause i will personally call your parole officer and tell her all about it.
Hey, i got no beef with you.
if we need to take this outside, let's do it.
you just pissed on the wrong boots, my friend.
come in.
I broke up with hoyt.
what the fuck?
Hoyt's my best friend in the whole world!
and he has been since the first grade!
well, i don't love him anymore.
I don't. I mean, i do, but not in the way that i want.
so you just break his heart?
I don't want to hurt him,
but i can't help the way i feel.
no, i don't want any part of this!
Jason, i know you feel the same way.
it's like my blood that's inside you. It talks to me!
you gotta get outta here.
what? - Yeah. I take back whatever invitation you got to come in my house.
but you kissed me back!
I know.
nobody benefits more from Steve newlin's disappearance - Than steve newlin himself. - That's a typical liberal response.
blame the victim.
here be my boyo.
lady antonia?
I am no lady.
I am peasant,
and proud of it.
I come in peace.
do you?
I know you are not alone.
nor are you.
a sad testament to our inability to trust each other.
but i still believe that we can achieve a peaceful resolution.
describe this peaceful resolution to me.
we will never harm you again.
anyone who has done so
has been commanded to desist,
or they will face the true death.
in return, i only ask that you remove the spells from my two subjects here.
you say you are willing to execute those who have harmed me, but you bring them to me,
and you ask me to remove spells i placed on them in self-Defense.
all for a promise that i'll never be harmed again.
Yes.
I have your word for this?
I swear it.
bill, she's casting a spell!
Demoness!
now!
you may have dominion over us, but you do not over the living.
surrender now and no one will be hurt.
I got a stake with your name on it, motherfucker!
you dropped somethin'.
Sookie, you in there?
you smell like shit.
I'm not gonna miss you one bit.
I forbid you!
you gotta fuckin' be kiddin' me.
I command you, do not harm her.
now or ever.
if you do, i will personally execute you!
this is so fucking lame!
why did you save me?
you know why.
move! Move!
I'm not a vampire, you idiot!
thank you.
Sookie. - Take that, fanger!
Yeah, you're scared now!
we meet again.
Oh, fuck.
please! - No!
turn her for us.
I'm a gay vampire American and I love you, Jason Stackhouse.
Jason is mine!
now we just need some fire.
who wants to die first?
you, Hayes. - Nora.
I knew you had friends in high places, but a chancellor of the Authority?
what's going on that you couldn't call?
it's Russell Edgington, Sook. He's on the loose.
we're just living here till we get back on our feet after, well, it was a fire.
go home, Patrick. - I lost it in a fire.
it's not just you and me. Privates Jemarcus Kessler and Todd Jeffries had them, too.
this is about what happened that night in Iraq and you know it.
when our Packmaster dies there's certain things we have to do to honor him.
lead us to Marcus and no harm will come to Luna or Emma.
it's kind of nice of you to dig your own grave for us.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Sam didn't kill our Packmaster, I did.
don't do it, Martha.
I will never bow before you.
in the name of the one true Vampire Authority, do not move.
Tara! That is Sookie.
you is killing her.
do something. - I am.
I'm laughing. - Get off me!
okay, I can't do this all night.
I got a job to get to. - You can't just leave.
you're her maker. - And I made her.
she's your problem now.
you owe me, faerie.
she gonna kill us.
as your maker, I command you not to bite these two humans.
Comprende?
Ah, I think she got it.
stay in the house!
good luck, kiddos.
my neck.
Ciao.
what the hell do we do now?
well, I'll go in this way and maybe...
darling.
Salome, listen to me.
they're more valuable to us alive.
I never had any intention of betraying you
fairy tales are for children.
Mr. Compton. Welcome.
and you are?
Mr. Northman.
you're taller than I had expected.
I get that a lot.
Ah, life is full of surprises. Isn't it?
do you honestly think I would jeopardize my entire career to harbor two fugitives
we'll talk later... many times, I'm sure.
down to reception.
Yes, ma'am.
ambassador Cole, please report to exsanguination chamber six.
we're here. - I'll let the Guardian know.
you ain't eating?
not hungry. - Not hungry?
he thinks he's above the laws of the pack.
well, that's fine.
shows you what kind of wolf he really is.
tell you what, though.
no problem.
walking away don't make you a bigger man.
just makes you a coward.
that's right. - Coward.
well, thank you for clearing that up.
enjoy your food.
if I ever see your face around here again, I'll personally rip your throat open.
fucking chickenshit.
my son was not perfect, but he deserves respect.
I disagree.
you murdered the Packmaster.
as new master of this pack, it is your obligation to eat.
no, thank you.
I've no interest in being the new Packmaster.
or eating the old one.
what you're interested in is irrelevant.
there are laws.
I don't care about the goddamn laws.
you find someone else.
good luck.
come on, Sam.
let's go. Okay.
back the fuck off. I'm taking him.
sweetheart?
we're all gonna die.
it's coming for us. - What?
Terry, wake up.
what the hell, Terry?
I'm tired.
grab her.
how?
there's some Tru Blood in the cabinet.
Tara, sweetie? You gotta eat.
Pam, where ya been? I had to open alone.
is Eric back? Did he call?
Eric? Huh-uh. Nothing.
why are you all dirty?
I was in the ground.
what's your excuse?
Nicolas, Campari. - Yes, ma'am.
got a boost for a working girl?
Mr. Danton is prowling. He asked for Claire.
have you seen her? - She's in number three.
almost an hour now.
God damn them.
Eric, if you're mad at me, fine. I can deal.
but you can't just vanish. We have a business to run.
call me.
so, any ideas?
not really. - Shh.
a little different on this side of the bars, isn't it, Nora?
a friend of yours?
he was a nurse practitioner in Mass General's maternity ward.
instead of delivering babies, he kept eating them.
Newborns!
I mean, just so... succulent.
Mr. Compton, Mr. Northman, welcome to New Orleans.
of course, we all wish it were under better circumstances.
tell me, Mr. Compton, why did you and Mr. Northman make contact with Chancellor Gainsborough?
she was my prisoner.
there were others aligned with the three of you, waiting to aid and abet.
we killed nine of them.
where were they taking you?
no idea.
sir, I urge you to release Nora and Sheriff Northman.
they were following my orders. They deserve mercy.
a noble gesture, Mr. Compton.
but a lie, we both know.
Oh, you just fucked us!
the UVs!
Oh, please!
tell them what they wanna know!
okay, I gotta check on Emma. - Okay.
Hey, hey, hang on.
I don't think Luna wants to see you right now.
no, get out.
Luna, please. I just...Emma is my granddaughter.
and I wish I could change that but I can't.
I don't want you here. I don't want you anywhere near her.
you understand? - Yes, I do.
may I just... - Go!
what happens when Emma turns?
she'll need a pack.
for all you know, Emma's a shifter.
she's wolf. I can feel it.
fuck what you feel.
you and Marcus, two peas in a pod.
you both have tempers.
had.
blood is blood.
Emma's got my son in her veins.
please, don't keep her from me. She's all I have left.
I'm sorry about your injuries.
that bitch is out of her mind if she thinks I'm just gonna hand Emma over to her and her freaks.
easy, now. She just lost her son.
she just ate her son.
fucking lunatic. - I know.
but she is family, right?
I don't want Emma anywhere near those people.
what if Emma is a wolf?
I mean, at least with a pack... - At least what?
what, she can be a cannibal?
she can run around with idiots and criminals?
I know you have your opinions, Sam, but could you just keep them the hell to yourself for now?
whoa, hey, how'd we get here?
I'm just sayin'... - I know you're just saying, but I have to protect my daughter.
okay? - Okay.
I've been through a lot of shit.
I know what I'm doing. - Yes, you do.
we both just want what's best for Emma.
no, there is no "we.
Emma is my daughter.
don't worry about what's best for her. I know what's best.
I know Emma's not my daughter, but I thought the three of us had something pretty special here.
I get that you've had a tough past.
you get that. Get this.
Emma and I are blood.
so you either have my back, or get the fuck out.
Jesus, what is wrong with you? - Just get the fuck out.
gladly, psycho. - Fuck you.
fuck you, too.
sun's gonna be up in half an hour.
if we don't get her into Eric's cubby, she isn't gonna make it.
where you at?
come on now, hooker. Drink.
drink.
it's burning her, Sook!
help me get her in the cubby! Quick!
Stackhouse? - Yeah?
I had sex. - Heh-hey!
welcome to the club!
it's not the first time, assmunch.
only reason I mention it is, the lady who I had it with has been sort of blowing me off lately and I got to thinking, maybe I did something wrong?
are you kidding?
that means you did something right.
I mean, that's getting to eat the pie without having to pay for the cow.
win-win.
but you were saying the other day, about your vampire lady friend?
Yeah, well, uh, turns out we're just keeping it casual, too.
you're okay with that? - Yeah.
hell, yeah.
perfect situation.
there's that abandoned car that lady called in.
this is damn strange.
somebody just dump her here?
anything?
Yeah, belongs to a Deborah Susan Pelt.
Hey, I know her.
Yeah, Sookie's got a friend, Alcide, and Debbie is his girlfriend.
Sookie said she's batshit crazy.
they live in Shreveport.
so, what the hell's the car doing here?
you find that in the car? - Yeah.
good man.
you see, Christine.
I will always be a Christian first and a vampire second.
but many people feel, and you yourself have said, Reverend Newlin, those two things are incompatible.
well, I'm happy to say that they are not.
I still talk to God every night.
I talked to Him this evening, as a matter of fact, and I'm here to tell ya, Jesus loves vampires.
I mean, anyone who's been dead for three days knows where we're coming from.
and I think that there are good Christians out there who would be willing... to set aside childish loathing - Oh, sorry. - in favor of universal love.
can you believe that son of a bitch?
he was my hero. Now look at him.
freakin' vamper.
Really? - Yep.
what can I do for ya?
I got a real powerful vampire who's just itching to sink his fangs into me.
you got a vamp problem, you need a colloidal silver mister.
"knock, knock." "Who's there?," "It's me, a vampire."
Oh, it burns, it burns. I'm gonna leave you alone, go eat your neighbor.
this is the very same mister I have on my trailer.
is that right? - You betcha.
now, can I interest you in a slightly more permanent solution?
well, maybe.
should invite her on next week's vamp hunt.
let her string one up and stake it.
bet she'd fuck me after.
just so you know, staking anyone, vampire or human, is a federal offense.
we have been in country too long... Do it.
Terry Bellefleur. Ah!
Oh, my God, Arlene, baby. I am so sorry.
I want you to tell me what is going on, and I want you to tell me now.
it's nothing. - That is bullshit.
you are damn near losing your mind over something.
you're not sleeping.
you just attacked me.
this has something to do with Patrick, - I just know it. - This was an accident.
you shoved me clear across the kitchen.
I said it was an accident.
what part of that don't you understand?
Oh, fuck it.
I can't leave her like this... Better off dead...
I gotta do it... Just do it!
mistake... - No!
goddamn cowardly life... - No!
just fucking do it! Do it, do it! - No! No!
I fucked up. - Lafayette, don't.
I turned her into the thing she hates most.
we didn't have a choice. She was dead.
and I shoulda left her dead, Sook.
Jesus is gone, and I didn't want to let her go, too.
and I turned her into this fucking thing for me.
that's not true. - Yeah, it is.
I ain't got nobody without her.
but that's my problem, not hers.
don't!
it'll get better.
when Jessica was turned, it took a long time for her to feel normal.
it's always hard in the beginning.
we are miles beyond hard, Sook.
Tara is in there.
you have to have faith.
please, give her a chance.
this ain't no life. - It will be.
I promise.
you don't fucking know that, Sook.
we can make a life for her.
even like this.
I used to believe that I had found the light, but I realized that I've only just now found God's true light in the darkness.
it's ironic. - And the Fellowship of the Sun?
I'm no longer associated with the Fellowship.
nor, might I add, any hate group, okay?
all vampires want is to co-exist peacefully with humans.
and if you take nothing else away from this interview, you need to understand that.
vampires are not the enemy. We-- we are God's creatures, just like you.
and all we want on this small, small planet is peaceful coexistence.
speaking of coexistence, is there anyone special in your life?
let's just say that... yes, there is someone... and she makes me very happy.
that was a bit of a gotcha question... - Kevin.
you remember giving a speeding ticket to Judge Clemens' boy?
he was doing 80 in a school zone.
no shit. - Flipped me off, too.
unbelievable.
anyway, I might need you to expunge it.
excuse me?
I had a talk with the judge.
we're gonna let him off with a warning.
a warning? He almost killed a kid.
could you just take care of it, please?
whatever you say...
sheriff. - And watch the attitude.
every fiber of our being... Wha... - I'm watching that.
you Officer Stackhouse?
well, I sure am.
how can I help you, champ?
Jesus.
my mom and dad are getting a divorce!
well, I'm sorry. But why the hell are you punching me?
I'm a cop, dude!
you had sex with my mom.
and now my dad is leaving.
look, kid. I don't know you, I don't know your mama.
my mama's Sharon Singer.
never heard of her.
Oh,"Crazy Sharon." Yeah. Hey!
whoa, whoa. I meant crazy in a good way.
get off of me!
come on, now. What the hell's going on?
he ruined my life. - How?
he had sex with my mom. - Jesus, Stackhouse.
have you slept with every woman in this town?
I don't know. I'm close, I guess.
Hey. Unbelievable.
come on, it's okay. Come on, son.
you touch Holly, I'm throwing your ass in jail.
may I help you?
beg pardon.
you are...quite lovely.
I'm off the clock.
come by tomorrow. We open at 8: 00.
that's right, whore.
I like it when you struggle.
you're not afraid.
I'm no stranger to dead bodies.
the streets can be dangerous at this hour.
a lady should really be more careful.
if I meet a lady, I'll let her know.
that is a lovely dress.
I'm sorry about all the blood.
it's... it's fine.
this should cover it.
thank you. Mister?
Mr. Compton?
I'm Dieter Braun.
it is a pleasure to finally meet you.
I bet you say that to all the prisoners.
I'm sorry about the ultraviolet lights, but we find it speeds the interrogation process.
now, full disclosure.
your I. V. contains a solution of electrolytically refined silver.
and I'm afraid that is as pure as it gets.
I have a problem, Mr. Compton.
Nora is a Chancellor of the Authority.
for her to conspire to allow you and Mr. Northman to escape, well, that is treason, punishable by the true death.
I'm sure you understand why I find this so... curious.
I do.
well, I need to know why she did it.
have you asked her?
we are speaking with her, yes.
and Mr. Northman. But I would like to hear what you have to say.
do you know what this is?
it's the Bible.
old or New Testament? - Neither.
it predates both.
it's the Original Testament.
the Vampire Bible.
it states that before God created Adam and Eve, He created Lilith.
who, like God, was vampire.
exactly. We were created in God's image.
not humans.
now, do you recall what our Bible tells us of humans?
if memory serves, it speaks of Adam and Eve's true purpose.
and their flesh shall nourish yours.
their blood shall flow within you.
for as the beetle nourishes the lark, so shall human nourish vampire.
powerful stuff, indeed.
do you believe it? - Believe what?
in the literal interpretation of our sacred text.
that humans are nothing more than our food.
I do not.
this, Mr. Compton... is where things get a bit tricky.
there are fundamentalists who do believe.
we think your friend, Nora, is one of them.
in that utopia, humans are farmed as food, nothing more.
emotional alliances between vampire and human are blasphemy.
I have known vampires who thought like this.
but I can assure you that is not my philosophy.
no.
this guardianship has struggled to make coexistence with humans a lasting reality.
but, and not to sound paranoid, there are forces aligned against us.
and I'm wondering if, perhaps, that might include you.
do you believe in the literal interpretation of our sacred text?
I do not.
have you consorted with those who do?
I have not.
are you sure?
it's wonderful to be a vampire.
isn't it? - Generally, yes.
right now? Not so much.
if you'll give me your full cooperation, not only will we not be needing the silver, but you, you'll leave here a free man.
unfortunately, I cannot say the same for your, um-- your accomplice.
she won't leave here "a free man"?
her betrayal was unforgivable.
she met the true death.
I know this must pain you.
I'm sorry.
but you must understand that noncooperation will not be tolerated.
now, was it you or Mr. Compton who murdered Nan Flanagan?
nan Flanagan is dead?
we know Mr. Northman is sympathetic with the Sanguinista Movement, so why protect him?
he's told us of your agenda, of your plans to undermine the mainstreaming movement, and he's walking free as we speak.
that is happy news, indeed.
you know, he turned on you in the first five minutes.
why endure this for him?
I just really enjoy your company.
well, then let's have some more fun.
I'm afraid Mr. Compton doesn't have your backbone.
he's been freed.
and in return for your cooperation, he'll be reinstated as king.
in light of that, is there-- is there anything you'd like to say?
long live the king.
chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug!
not in the house.
Howdy.
what-- are you having a party?
just some close friends.
Oh, my God. Look.
holy shit. Is that Steve Newlin?
yo. - Yo, Rev!
can I just say, before you became a vampire, you were a massive dick.
I know!
let me touch your fangs?
what do you want?
um, just a little chin-wag.
in private.
I think you and I got off on the wrong foot.
is that right? - Yes.
see, I didn't realize that you and Jason Stackhouse were involved.
and I think that I came off like a real-- well, like a real party crasher.
however, I am prepared to offer you $10, 000 for Jason.
10, 000 bucks?
in cash.
20000
20 thou-- No.
Nope.
let me ask you a question, Steve.
have you seen Jason's butt?
of course I've seen it. Why do you think I'm offering $10, 000?
well, it's rock hard.
you could chip a fang on it.
F-f-fifteen thousand, and that's it.
and speaking of... "rock hard"?
let's just say... you won't be disappointed.
okay, okay, 20, 000.
look at you.
fang boner and real boner.
you are pathetic.
Jason is my friend. I do not sell my friends.
get the fuck out of my house.
Hair-pulling? Really?
how do you like it?
the next time you think about crashing my party, don't.
my dad's the king.
not anymore.
awesome. - Go, Jessica!
Hey. Idiots.
you're boring me. Go back to your human lives before I eat you.
Hey, Patrick.
thought I'd seen the last of the Bellefleur clan this time around.
well, you know us Bellefleurs.
sometimes we'll surprise ya.
excuse me.
I haven't been sleeping that well.
Terry's been having these awful nightmares.
real barnburners.
sometimes he even cries out in his sleep.
seems like war talk, or-- or something.
I don't really know.
well, it happens to all of us. It's tough.
Terry doesn't really talk about his tour.
did something happen in combat that might've, y'know, stuck with him?
no, ma'am.
not that I can... nothing comes to mind.
you're the strong, silent type.
well, I like that.
well, heck, you know that. I even married one.
what are you doing here, Arlene?
she's looking for answers. Same as me.
I need to talk to the sergeant. Alone.
I got kids, Patrick, and I have too much invested in this man to watch him lose his mind.
do you understand me?
Yes, ma'am.
you two fix this.
private?
Eller ain't dead. He's just off the grid.
he's alive?
why'd you lie?
cause I didn't want to believe it was him. He's got a good heart.
Really? Well, let me tell you what else he has.
an itchy trigger finger and borderline psychotic tendencies.
but we're his friends. Why would he hurt us?
grudge, chemical imbalance, he likes to jerk off to house fires.
how the fuck should I know?
I know where he's holed up.
well, then let's visit him before he visits us.
careful, Hoyt. I don't want you to hurt yourself.
uh, hi, Ms. Fortenberry.
is Hoyt around? - He's helping me with my sink.
what do you want?
uh, just want to talk.
why don't you go fuck yourself? - Hoyt, language!
excuse me.
listen, Bubba.
this ain't right, man.
you living back at home with your mom?
my life's my business.
what do you care, anyway?
well, I'm-- I'm just sick of messing up life.
look, why don't you come stay at my place?
stay for as long as you want.
I'll even stay at Sook's.
please? - Believe it or not, I want to be here.
I don't want your house, I don't want your charity.
now get the fuck out. - Hoyt.
what the fuck, Mama?
I spent the last fucking hour down there, fixing your fucking sink for fucking free.
so if you don't like it that I say "fuck," that's too fucking bad.
Hey. - No, don't come around here anymore.
all right? We are over.
I will never forgive you for what you did to my boy, Jason Stackhouse.
you are dead to me.
thank you for splitting up Hoyt and that red-haired slut.
I'm gonna bake you a pie.
and stay out!
Emma. Go to sleep, sweetie.
Emma, it's late.
go to bed.
Emma. What in the world is going on in there?
Emma, go-- Holy fuck.
I will never forgive either of you.
wait!
Mr. Compton, Mr. Northman, to meet under these circumstances, it is a shame.
one of several recent disappointments.
you think you know somebody... you consider them an ally for centuries, and when they betray you, they won't even tell you why, no matter how persuasive you can be.
no. No!
No!
guardian, no! I'm innocent!
No! No! No!
I'm in a real pickle here, boys.
according to Nan Flanagan, you-- what is it she liked to call you guys?
"Fuckup One" and "Fuckup Two"-- you have made egregious errors.
rocket launchers on Main Street?
not to mention your so-called "Festival of Tolerance,"
where humans were attacked by vampires in full view of the media, with our official spokesperson in attendance.
keeping that quiet wasn't cheap.
now, Nan-- ahem-- was no prize, either.
still, she was Authority.
and that, boys, is the point.
we are the Authority.
I am the Authority.
the true death for Northman means the true death for Northman.
are you now or have you ever been a member of the Sanguinista Movement?
I don't even know what it is.
Mr. Northman?
Yeah, I'm trying to stay away from politics as much as possible.
are you? - And religion.
you're just in it for yourself?
you think the whole concept of the "common good" is hopelessly naive?
Chancellors?
well, it chaps my ass to say this, but when you got lame horses, you put them down.
the mainstreaming agenda is just too damn important.
it cannot fail.
true death for these fellas.
they destroyed a very real threat to all vampires.
if there is no documentation of humans being killed by vampires, we are infinitely better served letting them live.
they killed an Authority member. - She was on her way out.
she... - As you can see, this council has had heated debates over what to do with you two sons of guns.
every vampire on this council has committed our careers, our lives, our destinies, to mainstreaming.
coexistence with humans is not an option.
it is a necessity. It is merciful.
it is just.
it is vital.
not to mention that they outnumber us a thousand to one.
any threat to mainstreaming is a threat to us.
fundamentalism is a dead end and I won't fucking have it!
not out there, and most certainly not in here.
do you have anything to say before I pronounce sentence?
I offer you an exchange.
our lives in return for Russell Edgington.
Russell Edgington is dead.
nan Flanagan assured me of it.
she assured the world of it-- on camera.
sheriff Northman and I consigned him to the ground, but we did not kill him.
tragic mistake. - Because he has now broken free.
that sounds like a lie to me.
but it is the truth.
whether we live or die, you will find out soon enough.
well, they have every reason to lie, but... I must say that I'm intrigued.
Russell wants nothing more than anarchy.
if you would like your entire mainstreaming agenda, then by all means ignore me.
the only thing Russell wants more is to see us dead.
Why?
he pissed me off.
then I pissed him off.
you know how these things go.
no, I don't.
why would you keep Russell Edgington alive?
after what he did, we felt the true death was too good for him.
we wanted him to suffer.
you "wanted"?
you disobeyed the Authority to satisfy your feelings?
I feel like staking you so fucking much right now.
guardian!
I was the one that did it.
you're a king and you allowed him
Lilith help me, I am going to stake you!
unfortunately, unlike the two of you,
I understand there are a great many things more important than my... personal desires.
guardian, I promise you, now Russell is free, he will stop at nothing to find us.
and when he does, you will be there to put an end to him, as we should have.
I offer this to you as a final gesture of solidarity.
I, like you, believe that mainstreaming is possible and essential, but Russell must be stopped.
I fully expect to meet the true death, either way.
I turned her into the thing she hates most.
we didn't have a choice. She was dead.
and I should have left her dead, Sook.
we're all gonna die.
hostile!
as new master of this pack, it is your obligation to eat.
I have no interest in being the new Packmaster.
what if Emma is a wolf?
I don't want Emma anywhere near those people.
we both just want what's best for Emma.
no, there is no "we." Get out.
you're not afraid.
I'm no stranger to dead bodies.
there's that abandoned car that lady called in.
it belongs to a Deborah Susan Pelt.
so what the hell's the car doing here?
do you know what this is? - The Vampire Bible.
it states that before God created Adam and Eve, he created Lilith who, like God, was a vampire.
Eller ain't dead. He's just off the grid.
I know where he's holed up.
well, then let's visit him before he visits us.
I will never forgive either of you.
we are the Authority.
do you have anything to say before I pronounce sentence?
I offer you an exchange.
our lives in return for Russell Edgington.
Russell Edgington is dead.
sheriff Northman and I consigned him to the ground, but we did not kill him.
if you would like your entire mainstreaming agenda, and your administration with it, to be completely obliterated, then by all means ignore me.
Tara, we just want to help!
Tara! Please let us explain.
we just wanna help, Tara.
goddamn piece of shit.
my nail.
ma'am, can you help me?
because I have never changed a tire before in my life.
listen, I
I got no problem with vampires.
in fact, you know, I'm on your side.
I think that y'all should have the same rights that we do.
Oh, God, please, I don't wanna die. Don't hurt me.
please, let me go. Please, let me go.
you don't have to do this. You don't have to - you can just let me go.
I'm sorry.
Russell Edgington, alive.
what an epic fucking disaster!
allow me to take care of these traitors, Guardian.
they will beg for the true death.
shouldn't we at least consider their proposal?
since when do we negotiate with apostates?
if they think they can smoke out Russell Edgington, why not let them try?
the odds are they won't survive the fight.
and what kind of precedent does that set, rewarding these traitors for what?
not following orders in the first place. Exactly.
we cannot condone this blatant insubordination.
Rosalyn, you would sentence your own maker to the true death if it served your political agenda.
my maker was a pioneer, a true mainstreamer, unlike some people
chancellors, thank you for your input.
be assured that I will take it all under advisement.
bless the Blood.
stay.
the Sanguinistas have turned Russell Edgington into some kind of hero for ripping out a man's spine on TV.
he has become the poster boy for the anti-mainstream movement, their Osama bin Laden.
do you know the one thing more dangerous than a martyr?
a 3, 000-year-old vampire who hasn't fed in over a year.
suffering does not kill the appetite for power.
it exacerbates it.
I've dedicated my guardianship to the fight for coexistence, and I will not see it go swirling down the shitter because of one ancient, pissed-off psychopath.
do you understand what I am saying?
absolutely, Guardian.
we'll bring him in...
or die trying.
what do you think?
well, they put him in the ground once.
send in the new Nan Flanagan.
it is an honor to be of service.
I need to talk to you in private.
excuse me, but this is an emergency.
excuse me, so is this.
my maker hasn't been home in four days, not that you give a shit.
Eric's missing?
bill's demon spawn thinks they're on some kind of business trip, but we both know the only business Eric ever has with King Bill is the kind that involves almost getting themselves killed protecting you.
whatever they're up to has got nothing to do with me.
Eric and I, and Bill, we're over.
if only. - Pam, listen.
asking you for help again is about the last thing I wanna do right now, but Tara ran away.
she's too fast. We can't catch her.
she's out there somewhere, scared, hungry
we had a deal. I held up my end of it.
you haven't done shit for me, Tinker Bell, so whatever you're asking
Pam, you're her maker.
all I need you to do is summon her.
then we'll take her home and never bother you again. I promise.
I'm not interested in you or that pathetic excuse for a vampire you had me make, so get out of my bar before I suck you dry.
find Tara.
fuck Tara and fuck you!
God!
crazy!
what are you looking at?
go back to dry-humping each other and buying my overpriced drinks or get the fuck out!
what the fuck? - Help me.
what happened to you?
I'm hungry.
nan Flanagan, may the cold bitch rest in peace, went on CNN and told the world Russell Edgington had met the true death more than a year ago.
tonight, however, we have learned that he is still very much alive.
excuse me, sir, but says who?
Elvis was spotted buying turkey jerky in a 7-Eleven in Yakima last Thursday, but that doesn't mean he's still alive.
that just means people will believe anything they wanna believe.
humans are not rational.
they are 100% motivated by fear.
all they want is to feel safe, to know that they're good and right and they're gonna end up in a heaven full of puffy clouds with everybody they've ever loved wearing angel wings.
so, you tell me what you what them to believe and I'll sell it to them.
Reverend Newlin, you have been a vampire now for, what, four months?
and yet you find it funny to ridicule and underestimate the human race?
the race that birthed all of us into existence? Is this some kind of joke?
revered Newlin was recruited because of his connection to the Fellowship of the Sun.
with his influence in the religious right, he'll be able to speak to people we never hoped to reach.
he can be valuable if we give him the chance.
don't be nervous, Steve.
I was new once. I get it.
all I wanted to do was feed, fuck, and kill.
it took me centuries to realize that humans aren't just walking meat.
they're our ancestors.
none of us would be here without them.
have you heard of the Sanguinista Movement?
they believe that humans should be farmed like cattle, owned like slaves.
they believe in nothing.
they've learned nothing from history.
if we do not evolve, if we continue to behave like fucking savages, the humans will rise up.
they will retaliate with their armies. It is just a matter of time.
right now this council is the only thing preventing a civil war.
that is why I need you, Steven.
if, for whatever reason, our sources are unable to bring Russell Edgington in quietly and he winds up on the TV threatening to eat children,
I will need a friendly, trustworthy, vampire mainstreamer who knows how to work a crowd.
I won't let you down, sir.
you'd better not.
make sure Mr. Northman and Mr. Compton are harnessed and thoroughly scanned.
we do not want a repeat of the necromancy bullshit.
I'll take care of it, Guardian.
find out everything you can.
now, if you guys could take your shirts off for me, that'd be great.
what is that?
we call it the I-Stake.
that's catchy. - Right?
one click and this little sucker will pierce your heart faster than a bullet.
Wooden-tipped, of course. All right, there you go.
pinches a little, I know, but you'll get used to it.
just imagine it's a training bra.
well, it's been a long time since I wore one.
how do you trigger these devices?
there's an app for that.
you're joking. - Nope.
so if you try to do something stupid like attack me or try and run away or whatever, - click and splat. - Efficient.
same applies if you try and remove the harnesses, FYI.
these things are totally indestructible
waterproof, fireproof, yadda yadda yadda, knows who you had for breakfast and where you go to ground.
so do yourselves a favor - don't fuck around, okay?
you guys are too cute to be goo.
Thanks.
shit, Sook, I looked everywhere.
Merlotte's?
her mama's? - Merlotte's closed.
Lettie Mae ain't seen her.
did you tell them? - What was I gonna say?
sorry, Auntie. I had your only daughter turned into a vampire.
Oh, and by the way, she may be brain-damaged, too. " You're welcome.
it's not gonna stay a secret.
not in this town.
well, then we'd better figure out some kind of story on how Tara got turned and one that don't end in you blowing that were-bitch's head off and me helping you dispose of her body.
state she in, she could be anywhere, tellin' anybody anything.
it's not what she's telling people that I'm worried about.
sun's gonna be coming up soon.
we gotta hope she's got enough sense to go to ground someplace safe.
another one?
more. I don't care if it's cold.
you sure? - I'm starving.
Tara, talk to me. Tell me who did this to you.
all right, I'm calling Lafayette.
Sookie? She's your best friend.
Tara, you don't want to talk to me, you need to talk to someone.
No!
do not fucking call them, Sam. Don't tell them where I am.
promise me you'll
Kevin, Rosie.
morning, Sheriff Bellefleur.
you been working out, hon?
uh, actually, I have been hitting the weights here and there.
thanks for noticing. - Gotta watch that figure, huh?
now that you're a local sex symbol? - Rosie, shut up.
what are you talking about?
what's she talking about?
answer me, Officer, or I'll have you patrolling park urinals the rest of the month.
nice mug shot, Sheriff.
is that Facebook? - I mean, it is a real nice picture.
I mean, from a photography standpoint. - Shut up.
I'm sure the good people of Bon Temps will be real glad to know y'all are spending their hard-earned tax dollars surfing porno on the Internet!
get back to work!
sheriff Bellefleur. - What?!
gordon Pelt. This is my wife Barbara.
we're here to talk to you about our daughter Debbie.
sorry, uh - Mr. and Mrs. Pelt, thank you for coming.
Jimmy, on aisle 3 there's a bag of dog food that opened. Clean it up.
miss Steeler?
it's been a long time.
15 years.
I can't believe this.
wait, last I heard, you'd moved to Indiana and married a podiatrist.
a psychiatrist. We're divorced.
sorry about that.
but you're back in Bon Temps. That's awesome.
you still teaching?
no, I quit a long time ago.
wow, really? But you were - you were so great at it.
I remember everything you ever taught me.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't...
I'd better get going. Jason, don't.
I just need your help with something.
crunchy or sweet?
sweet.
I cried myself to sleep worrying about you, waiting for you to come home.
I know, and I'm sorry. You deserve a lot better.
look, whatever is going on with you and Patrick, whatever y'all did over there, you can tell me.
I love you, Terry Bellefleur.
ain't nothing you say is gonna change that.
just tell me. - I can't. I promised.
we promised a whole bunch of stuff in our wedding vows.
don't that count for nothing? - 'Course it does, baby.
I don't wanna lie to you.
and I'm real bad at it, anyway.
I'm gonna tell you as much as I can, okay?
okay.
I'm going somewhere with Patrick and we're leaving right now.
well, where to? - I can't tell you.
well, what are you gonna do there? - I can't say.
how long are you gonna be gone? - Don't know.
okay, well, don't expect me to be waiting for you when you get back.
morning, Arlene.
you didn't happen to see Tara last night?
I got this.
Hey, peaches and cream, stop all that crying before you mess up your pretty mascara.
lafayette, go away!
now, is that a yes or a no on seeing Tara? - No!
Sookie, hey.
didn't realize you were working today.
did you see Tara last night?
no.
no. No, why?
I called you a bunch of times and never heard back.
I was hoping maybe she was with you.
look at her boobs, boobs, boobs, the way she smells.
think about that, anything but the walk-in- shit!
walk-in, walk-in, walk-in, walk-in. Damn it!
walk-in? Tara's in the walk-in? - Fuck!
it was the only light-tight place I could think of.
why would you lie to me, Sam?
well, she made me promise not to tell you.
is she okay? - Hell, no! She's a vampire!
from how pissed she was at you and Lafayette,
I'm guessing you had something to do with that.
she was gonna die.
the less you know about all that, the better, for your own good.
if you hate me, it's fine.
listen...
you know, my brother died in my arms.
he wanted to go, but I can't help wondering if I should've fought harder.
the way I see it, you gave Tara another chance.
it may not be the kind of life she had in mind, but it's up to her now what she wants to do with it.
thank you for keeping her safe and... everything.
can I give you a hug without you thinking about my boobs?
probably not. - Oh, what the hell. Go ahead.
he put my cousin in the fucking freezer?
the cold isn't gonna bother her any. When they sleep, they're basically dead.
we just have to make sure that nobody opens this door until nightfall.
Yeah, and then what?
it's like keeping a pet gator in a bathtub.
we can't handle her by ourselves.
we're just gonna have to find a way.
Sookie, you working today? 'Cause we got prep to do.
coming.
we have something to satisfy even the most exotic fancies.
the chink, we call her Rubber Ruby.
show the gentleman why. Would you, darling?
mm, delightful.
but it is you I came to see.
a good merchant doesn't compete with her merchandise, sir.
and a good customer knows everything has its price.
God damn them.
I am just a blood bag.
my life is meaningless.
good little whore.
now say,"Drain me, Daddy.
drain me till I'm dead.
drain me, Daddy. Drain me till I'm dead.
get your hands off of her. - William, don't.
Oh, Lorena, you procreated.
Oh, and he is protective. How sweet.
who are you? - Eric Northman.
but to you, the true death.
Eric, please. He's new. He doesn't understand.
I understand perfectly.
if Mr. Northman wants a fight, he can fight a man.
well, he is brave and loyal.
strong for one so young.
it would be a shame to waste a promising vampire simply because his maker failed to educate him on how to treat his elders.
thank you.
we did not know this was your territory.
we deeply regret any inconvenience we may have caused.
Oh, it is the lady you owe the apology to.
a - And $500 for every girl that you drained.
we are sorry.
aren't we, William?
you had better get him under control.
I believe we have a debt to settle.
hello.
that's a cute kitty.
Oh, don't take it personally.
prince Charming doesn't like sharing me.
he used to pee in my ex-husband's shoes.
prince Charming, huh? Well, that explains it.
a name like that's just too much to live up to.
so, what's your life been like?
are you married? You have a girlfriend?
I ain't had the best of luck in that department.
one died right next to me, one was married to a gay preacher.
crystal was a
let's not even go there.
but right now I'm fuck buddies with the love of my best friend's life, who's a teenage vampire.
it's just all kinds of messed up.
but it's really great to see you.
I mean, really great.
I've thought about you a lot over the years. - Me, too.
what happened between us was- - Amazing, I know.
I was gonna say wrong.
I made a terrible mistake.
I never meant to hurt you or take advantage of you.
I'm so sorry. - Well, I'm not.
you taught me how to do the only thing I ever been great at.
Jason, no.
I don't care what you say - that ain't no mistake.
this ain't no mistake. - Jason.
Oh, God.
you found her car where? - In Bon Temps. Off Hummingbird Lane.
does she have any friends there?
friends?
I wouldn't say that.
well, what would you say?
our daughter's missing, Herveaux.
as far as we know, you're the last person who saw her.
honey, calm down. This isn't helping.
we know you two had a fight.
she called us, said she was coming home to Jackson, only she never showed up.
it was more than a fight.
I abjured her. - You what?
sorry to be the one to tell you, but she's back on the blood.
caught her running around on me again.
abjuring her was the only way I knew how to end it for good.
you're lying. She's been sober for over a year.
she wanted to marry you, have your cubs.
well, screwing her new Packmaster was a hell of way of showing it.
that's my little girl you're talking about.
if you hurt her, you son of a bitch- - Gordon, stop.
I didn't do anything to Debbie.
she's probably holed up with some drainer, getting loaded.
they found her wallet, Alcide. All her money, her phone.
now, I know Debbie's no angel.
something's happened to her, I can feel it.
if there's anything you can do to help us find her, we're at the Sunshine Inn.
Yeah, I know her.
that's Debbie Pelt.
you seen her recently?
she gave me a ride to Shreveport to run some errands.
and you haven't seen her since?
did something happen to her?
been missing a few days.
we found her car abandoned about a quarter-mile from your house.
that's weird.
Jason tells me you said Debbie was "batshit crazy. " What's that mean?
her boyfriend's a good friend of mine.
we try to get along, but we aren't BFFs.
she can be unpredictable.
bet she didn't appreciate her boyfriend being friends with a single gal like you.
or maybe you and this Alcide Herveaux were a little more than friends.
Andy, if you're suggesting- - I ain't suggesting. I'm asking.
was Debbie Pelt jealous of your relationship with her boyfriend?
I don't know.
I do know she's a V addict, she's paranoid, and can be real nasty.
if something happened to her, I'm sorry. But she brought it on herself.
why don't you tell that to her parents?
they're here searching for their only daughter.
V addicts have parents, too, and they deserve the same justice as me or you.
well, justice is your job, not mine.
so unless disliking someone's a crime and you're gonna arrest me for it, - I gotta get back to work, okay? - For now.
Hey, Sheriff Andy. - Miss Cleary. Speak to you outside?
we fucked and our asses is goings to jail.
he doesn't know anything.
it didn't sound that way to me.
I listened to his thoughts.
he's more concerned about the size of his rear end right now than he is about Debbie Pelt.
trust me.
I know you've been through a lot, but I need you to keep your eye on that walk-in and try and act like your normal, fabulous self.
can you do that for me?
these beans is colder than titties in a brass bra. Come on, now. Shit.
well, all right! Jesus! What's your problem?
I never seen her before.
how about this one?
on Facebook?
Oh, I'm gonna skin those brats alive.
I will make sure they take it down before anyone else sees it.
facebook already took it down.
it don't matter, though.
I could walk down Main Street naked with a bag on my head, folks'd still know it was me.
Oh, I'm so sorry. - Nah, don't worry about it.
a town like this, people'll stop talking about it in 15 years.
anyway, now that the cat's out of the bag, uh, if you wanna, I don't know, take whatever this is to the next level, we got nothing to lose.
sheriff Andy, are you asking me to go steady?
I guess I am.
well you - you realize I'm a witch, right?
my kids are delinquents.
I live in a motel.
well, I live with my grandma, and I'm an alcoholic and a recovering V addict and the laughingstock of the Renard Parish Sheriff's Department.
how'd we get so lucky?
that was - I had no idea how much I needed that.
I got half a box of wine in the cooler. Want some?
you - you were right.
what we did back then - it was a mistake.
wait. Don't leave.
good-bye, Miss Steeler.
thank you for joining me, Mr. Compton.
did I have a choice?
there are always choices.
are you comfortable in your new quarters?
as comfortable as one can be with a stake against his heart.
a necessary precaution.
I'm sure you understand. Walk with me?
do you know who I am?
you're Salome, beheader of John the Baptist, dancer of the Seven Veils.
don't believe everything you read.
the human Bible, it's little better than "Us Weekly.
they made me a convenient villain, a symbol for dangerous female sexuality.
but I was just a girl with a severely fucked-up family.
so, you didn't ask for a man's head on a silver platter?
politics.
John denounced my mother's remarriage to my uncle, the king.
she wanted him silenced, so she saw an opportunity in her new husband's fondness for teenage virgins.
the trade was her idea.
your mother traded your body for revenge.
and the Dance of the Seven Veils?
they wrapped me in sheer scarves when I was delivered to my uncle's bed.
I suppose you can call what followed a dance of sorts.
the humans of my youth, they were far more savage than any vampires I've known.
anyway...
the world's different now, and so am I.
and yet you still have the attention of the Guardian.
and you still have the power to send men to their deaths.
so perhaps not that much has changed after all.
I like you, Mr. Compton.
I've been tracking your political career for some time, and...
your rise has been quite impressive.
well, I am flattered.
though why someone of your stature would be interested in a small-town monarch such as myself is a mystery to me.
humility is for humans.
do you know what I admire the most about you?
clearly not my ability to take orders.
your heart.
you still let it rule you.
a rare quality amongst our kind.
we've become so jaded.
we celebrate our own cynicism.
I want to help you.
Why?
because something about you moves me.
and in over 2, 000 years, I've learned to trust that feeling.
the question is...
can I trust you?
how can I prove it to you when you already have my life in your hands?
perhaps by taking my life in yours.
what do you think?
honey, you are hotter than barbecue Tabasco sauce in that dress.
but if you're doing all this for Jason Stackhouse, trust me, you don't gotta work so hard.
what's that supposed to mean?
well, there ain't no nice way of saying this, but God gave that boy a penis and a brain - only enough blood to run one at a time.
well, you don't know him. He's actually a really good guy.
Oh, sweetie, I've known him all my life.
you seem like a nice vampire.
I just don't want to see you get hurt, that's all.
Really?
cause I think you just want me to know that you and Jason fooled around and that he dumped you, which I can't say I blame him for.
but if you want me to keep spending my daddy's money in your podunk store,
I suggest you stop talking shit about my friends.
okay, sweetie? - Yes, ma'am.
I'll get this one and one in red and those shoes, thanks.
Hi. Welcome to Tracy's Togs.
I'm Tracy. How can I help you?
I'm picking up an order.
garter belts. These for your girlfriend or your wife?
my sisters. - You sure got a lot of sisters.
16
you smell awesome. What are you?
W - Wait. Hey, wait!
Hey, you gotta pay for that dress!
Hey, where'd you go?
Hey, I can smell you... everywhere!
I know you.
Yeah, you're Jessica's.
no, not anymore.
honey, the eyeliner, the desperation - they'll eat you alive in here.
well, that's what I'm hoping for.
what's it like, being what you are?
Oh, it would take several of your lifetimes to answer that question.
then make me a vampire and we'll have all the time in the world.
you don't know what you're asking.
Yes, I do. I'm not afraid.
I can see that.
most humans beg me to spare their lives and you want me to take yours.
I want you to give me one worth living.
well, you seem to be doing quite well for yourself.
your profession may not be glamorous, but it's more honest than most.
do you know what happens to women like me when we get old?
we're pariahs.
we die alone in the dark - syphilis, TB.
if you had any idea what kind of life awaits me, you wouldn't hesitate to turn me.
and if you had any idea of the responsibility that comes with being a maker, you wouldn't dare ask.
then make me and leave me.
I'll take care of myself. I always have.
would you toss a newborn baby in a gutter?
abandoning a new vampire is no different.
becoming a maker is an eternal commitment
greater than any marriage, deeper than any human bond.
to throw that away is sacrilege.
an honorable vampire. Isn't that a contradiction?
no more than an intelligent whore, yet here we are.
what have you done?
let me walk the world with you, Mr. Northman...
or watch me die.
sheriff Northman.
good evening.
thank you, Chancellor, for your support at the hearing.
we owe you our lives.
you can stop performing.
I have this room swept for bugs daily.
we can be ourselves here.
please, sit down.
you surprise me.
and that doesn't happen very often.
I expected you to at least try and save her.
who? - Your sister.
don't worry, your secret is safe.
even Nora has no idea I know.
how? - Godric.
he was glorious before he lost his way.
he loved you the most.
well, now I see why.
so Nora risked everything for you, and you're willing to let us execute her for it.
what choice do I have? - There are always choices.
Godric gave you one while you bled out on that pyre.
be his companion or die.
are you lonely?
is this how you make friends?
friends you can trust are a rare commodity.
I sponsored Nora's chancellorship.
did you know that?
I mentored her.
so her betrayal makes you look particularly bad.
you're cold.
but it's because you've been hurt, and that wound is still fresh.
I heal quickly.
perhaps I can help you speed that along.
what do you want from me? - You know what I want.
I want to be your friend.
but it's what you want that intrigues me.
you killed Hayes, conspired with known Sanguinistas to aid in Compton and Northman's escape.
as we say in Texas, honey, if you find yourself in a hole, the first thing you do is stop digging.
and as we say in Surrey, sod the fuck off, you cunting twat!
here's my theory: I think you did it all for love.
so which one is it, hmm? The sheriff or the king?
both? Well, see, now that's a sandwich I'd take a bite out of anytime.
well, since their lives apparently mean nothing to you, we'll just go ahead and activate their I - Stakes.
wait!
Yes, I believe vampires were made in God's image.
I believe that mainstreaming is an abomination, and I believe that Lilith will rise from the Blood and rip your blasphemous fucking heads off and dance in your muck!
good girl.
now, doesn't that make you feel better, hmm?
I just had the weirdest experience.
Yeah, so did I.
there was this guy and I could smell his blood.
I'm sorry, I know that grosses you out, but it smelled like cotton candy and fresh baked bread and fucking sex
the most delicious thing I've ever smelled in my life.
why are you telling me this?
cause after he ran away, all I could think about was you.
inside of me.
just- - What?
n - Nothing, nothing. Let's do this.
okay. - Yeah.
I'm sorry, is there something wrong? - You know what? Yeah.
I ain't some mechanical bull you can come and ride on whenever you feel like it.
what the hell happened to you today?
let's see. Uh, well
I realized I got this big fucking hole inside of me that I've been filling with sex, 'cause that's what I got taught to do.
cause I was too fucking young, and it felt too fucking good, and it made it all go away.
but it ain't working no more.
and I don't know how to deal with what I'm feeling.
I can't do this right now.
just go.
listen, we don't have to have sex.
we could just talk. I just want to be your friend.
see, the minute you do that, my dick starts screaming,"Dude, just shut up and fuck her.
I can't be friends with a girl. I don't know how.
Yeah, you do.
you already are.
so, I'm gonna go put on a pair of your sweats and you're gonna grab yourself a beer, and then you're gonna tell me what the hell happened today.
and maybe I'll have some advice, maybe I'll just listen.
see?
it's that easy.
is somebody in here?
No!
rise and shine.
breakfast is ready.
come on now, hooker, drink.
we gotta get you outta here
don't fucking touch me.
they found her car near your house. - I heard.
she's back on the V. I don't know what she's capable of.
thanks for the warning, but I gotta get back to work.
I tell you Russell Edgington's on the loose, you thw me out of your house.
I tell you Debbie's MIA, maybe gunning for you, you act like it's no big deal.
I get you're tough, but that don't mean you have to be stupid.
I appreciate you caring, but that doesn't mean you get to talk to me like that. Excuse me.
there's something going on here, something you're not telling me, and I wanna know what.
nothing's going on, Alcide.
Oh, shit, Tara!
God.
lafayette, you okay?
what in tarnation - oh, my God.
Tara, what are you doing in there?
seriously, Sookie? This is your plan?
to pretend none of it happened?
why don't we talk about it outside, alone?
Why? Afraid he won't think you're so cute once he knows what you did?
you know that's not why.
Tara, please.
fuck off!
Hey, Sookie and Lafayette are your friends. They're trying to help you.
turning me into a monster?
I don't need that kind of help, and I don't need yours either.
Tara, wait
all I can think about is ripping out y'all's fucking throats, so stay the hell away from me for your own sakes, or I swear to God I'll do it.
nothing's going on, huh?
so, I had a visit this evening from a certain chancellor.
interesting.
what, you, too?
you know what they say about gentlemen
they don't brag about sloppy seconds.
what the hell does she want from us?
I have no idea, but something tells me she usually gets what she wants.
did you have fun?
they're not Sanguinista.
and how do you know that?
cause Sanguinista aren't unshakable in their beliefs.
Mr. Compton is still looking for something to believe in, and Mr. Northman he only believes in himself.
I think we can trust them.
I'm not sure we can trust anyone anymore.
Nora confessed.
she is Sanguinist.
your dismissal of the vampire Bible, your focus on mainstreaming above all else has divided vampires everywhere.
perhaps it's time to consider a change of course.
that's exactly what they fucking want.
they're recruiting one of my very own chancellors, trying to undermine my guardianship from the inside.
mainstreaming is working.
it is changing the world.
if JFK or Martin Luther King had backed off civil rights
maybe they'd still be alive.
there have been assassination threats, uprising in Estonia, the Middle East.
the Sanguinista are organizing against you.
I'm afraid for you, that's all.
don't be.
with you as my secret weapon, how can I lose?
what? - Just waiting on that gumbo.
turning your own flesh and blood into a vampire - who does that?
I hear you. I'm standing right here.
Gumbo ain't ready yet. Now get the fuck up out my kitchen!
shame, Lafayette. Shame on you!
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
no, no, no. No.
no.
she was trying to get to me.
Tara jumped in front
and Debbie shot Tara? - I got the gun and I
what, Sookie?
say it.
say it.
I killed her.
you were never gonna tell me?
you were gonna let me go looking for her?
wondering what the hell happened to her?
Yes.
because you loved her. You forgave her for everything.
I didn't know what you were gonna do- - Oh, bullshit!
I have had your back since the day we met.
and you owe me more than lying to my fucking face!
Alcide! I'm sorry!
I wish I could- - Shut up!
I don't wanna hear it.
I don't wanna hear another word.
I don't - I don't have a right to ask, but I need to know what you're gonna do.
I need to know if you're gonna tell anyone.
when...? - I don't...
now this is no come back sorry oh no alive can I what says - is - Sookie?
we just like what?
no, don't talk anymore.
I've waited so long for this.
Alcide, you sure know how to treat a lady.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I ain't down with this hinky brujo shit.
Sookie could've died in that car crash.
fuck you!
listen up.
I ain't never put too much stock in You, Lord God, but if you up there,
I'm tired of all this bullshit.
give it up. - You're fucked now.
Oh, life is suffering, bitch.
I'm a good man!
I did some shitty stuff, but compared to all evil out there, I'm good enough.
better than most. So cut me a break.
Jesus, if you're out there, can you give me a sign?
anything?
cause I need some help.
I just need some fucking help.
tie him up.
let's go.
did anything follow you here?
Eller, man, it's just us. You got nothing to worry
did anything follow you here?
no, man.
we're alone. Nobody followed us here.
I'm thinking maybe this was a not-so-great idea.
ho ho ho. Of course I need you, Rudolph!
really, Santa? To guide your sleigh?
you can do the thing that all the other reindeer can't. Come on!
Sookie, honey? Eat your cereal.
Ooh, you can so pinch an inch.
Hey. Hey, stop it. Come on.
Hey, champ. Come get some breakfast.
you ready to take the Stingrays today?
Yeah. We gonna kill 'em.
it's just Pee Wee, Corbett. - Pee Wee's still ball.
Dad- - What's the matter, Jason?
what's the matter, pumpkin?
mom- - your neck. You're bleeding!
Oh, there, there, sweetie.
do you want a little sex?
sex always makes you feel better, doesn't it?
not even a blow job?
Hello? Who?
Hey, Rosie, hey.
listen, what year is it? What year?
good. No, that's good.
Yeah, yeah. I'm on my way.
fucking fairies.
Andy Bellefleur, would you answer your phone? Andy, pick it up.
you're gonna wake the baby.
it's only rung about 4, 000 times.
Andy! - I fell in a
cheese and crackers, Andy.
would you put some clothes on? Have you lost your mind?
can a man have some privacy?
would you just pick up the phone?
ya see?
uh, yeah.
okay, I'll be there.
I'm not even sure that's possible.
you succeeded before, with Tara.
that was a maenad spell.
I've never tried to un-glamour someone.
where were you guys anyway?
we were worried. - Clearly.
Alcide's employee is the only person who can identify whoever it was that freed Russell.
I don't want Doug mixed up in this bullshit.
you fangers bring nothing but trouble and death.
well, we don't need your permission, wolf.
Russell has been under the ground for over a year.
it'll take him a few days to recuperate, and then when he does, he will be straight out after us on the hunt.
cause you didn't kill him when you had the chance.
what did you say? - You heard me.
I'm sorry.
I just keep thinking that if I make the right choice, all this madness will end and my life will go back to normal.
but it's not gonna end, is it?
this is it.
it's not gonna change.
we say goodbye, and the next thing, you guys are back in my house and a 3, 000-year-old vampire wants to suck my blood.
must be Thursday!
well, come on.
what are y'all waiting for?
let's go hunt Russell.
onwards into the jaws of death!
boot and rally!
thanks a lot, Tara.
you actually look halfway decent.
if I wanted to look like a drag queen, I would've raided Lafayette's closet.
here. You take the first shift.
you want me to bartend?
no, I want you to sit on your ass and play Scrabble.
Yes, I want you to bartend. Fangtasia's mine now and we're understaffed. So make yourself useful.
so, basically, I'm your slave. - Pretty much.
the more things change, the more they fucking stay the same.
can I get a Tru Blood, O- neg, sweet thing?
I am many things, but "sweet" ain't one of them.
all right.
Hi. - What can I get you?
you're new here.
Oh, okay, well.
if you wanna skip the small talk
repeat after me.
I will never, ever, ever fucking feed in public where people can see me and report me to the goddamn authorities.
but you said before- - Listen close.
I saved your fucking life and lent you some truly exquisite clothes.
but if you do anything to mess with Fangtasia,
I will silver you and stick you in a coffin to rot until the next millennium.
do you understand me?
Doug, this here's Sookie. Sookie, this is Doug.
it's real nice to meet you.
what can I do for you folks?
would you mind terribly if I took a little peek inside your head?
what do you remember about that night?
nothing. I swear.
I was taking my break, like always.
somebody's coming up to him. - What do they look like?
it's blurry. I can't make it out.
it's a woman.
she's digging Russell up with her hands.
gently.
what the fuck? What is this?
what the fuck is this?
wait.
she has a necklace.
a pendant, like a spider or...
a bat?
a female member of the Authority released Russell.
did you tell Nora that we buried Russell alive?
no. - I don't believe you.
well, I'm sorry to hear that.
you said you and Nora share everything. - Not that.
you couldn't keep your mouth shut and now she's using Russell against us.
that's absurd.
Nora risked her life to free me.
and you, too.
your boy, Chancellor Drew, is dead.
you served him up like a lamb to slaughter.
now he's just a pile of guts on the floor.
drew is goo.
drew is goo.
we will rise up.
the warriors of Lilith are coming for you.
coming for all of you.
your nights of sacrilege are numbered, Roman!
any news yet from Mr. Compton and Mr. Northman?
no, they dawdled about Bon Temps.
visited the home of a local waitress, went to the Kwik-E-Mart for a jumbo coffee and box of Nutter Butters, then traveled by cube van to a parking facility in Shreveport.
please notify Mr. Compton and Mr. Northman that the Guardian has instructed that they have until dawn to find Russell Edgington or they will be terminated.
chancellor Drew was a great man.
I thought he was a great man.
we drafted the Vampire Rights Amendment together.
he was deeply committed to mainstreaming.
how could he lose his way?
how could I not see it?
he fooled us all, Guardian. - So much blood.
for what?
some vampires believe the blood in this urn is the actual blood of Lilith.
they are just as misguided as the humans who think that their Communion wafer's the literal body of Christ.
and there I am, doing my little song and dance with the dropper.
symbolic ritual, nothing more.
forgive me, Guardian.
but the Sanguinistas are gaining ground.
they are recruiting followers even among your closest allies.
Yes, no shit.
two of my own chancellors.
it is a mistake to underestimate them.
perhaps if you- - I refuse to pander to fanatics.
but this is not what I'm suggesting.
just throw the religious base a bone.
control the message.
but on your own terms.
well, there's no denying it. Eller's the firebug.
he's the one who torched Kessler and Jeffries.
how long do you think he's been out here?
couple years at least.
man, he has really lost his fucking shit.
I just gotta do it.
Eller. - For the love of God, Eller
maybe if I kill you, it will forgive me.
Eller, you do not have to do this.
who needs to forgive you?
I saw them burn.
who? - Kessler- Him and his wife.
how?
after we got back, I was crashing on their couch for a while.
and this one night, I woke up and their house was on fire.
Jemarcus and Lana were trapped down a hall.
I tried to get to them, but the fire moved.
it didn't move like it was supposed to.
it didn't burn one thing and move on to the next.
the fire saw them running and intercepted them.
and they were screaming and then I saw it.
it was in the flames, it was looking at me.
coming for me.
so I jumped out the window and I ran and ran and just kept running.
I looked it up. Fucking Googled it.
came right up on the goddamn search engine.
it's called ifrit.
it means "the evil.
an infernal being of smoke and fire.
it's coming for us.
Eller, man, there's no fire monster coming for us.
Yeah, there is.
we shouldn't have done it.
we shouldn't have done what we did.
shut up. - We didn't do anything.
she cursed us, man. - Shut up.
she was dying and she cursed us.
Bellefleur, you stay with me, God damn it.
shouldn't have done what we did!
I don't wanna talk about it.
she's alive, Sergeant.
dead check her.
what? No. We can save her, Sergeant.
we can call in a medevac
we've been in country too long to get dragged down by this bullshit.
do you understand me? - We can help her.
there is only one thing that's important out here.
now tell me what the fuck that is.
the man to your left and the man to your right.
that's right. Now you fucking dead check her.
may the Ifrit burn you all and everything you've ever loved.
plucked off, just like virgins in a whorehouse.
earth to Stackhouse.
come on.
Hey. Andy.
do you remember how we got back from the club earlier tonight?
I was hoping you could tell me.
the last thing I remember was getting blasted out of there by those fairy bouncers.
and waking up buck naked.
watch that homo talk, Stackhouse.
folks'll sue you for that shit.
no, Andy. Those guys and all those strippers?
they're fairies. Like "Tinker Ball.
they're supes, man.
those ladies are fairies? - Yeah.
I fucked a fairy?
well, if you did it with one of them ladies, then, yeah.
whoa, what is it, man?
fuck it. I don't care if those ladies are fairies or leprechauns or frickin' Ewoks.
I got a good thing starting up with Holly, and I ain't gonna let Maurella and her sexy fairy friends mess it up for me.
so I'm gonna steer clear of that place.
and you and me? We ain't gonna talk about it no more.
you get me?
sweep the perimeter.
I'm gonna interview our witness.
these folks friends of yours?
I gotta ask you a few questions.
Yeah.
what happened here tonight?
well, we were getting together for dinner.
when I got here, I found Emory and Suzanne on the porch, dead.
how long did you know the victims?
about a year.
know anybody who'd want them dead?
no. No, they're good people.
is there anything else you wanna tell me?
anything hinky?
well, we're shifters.
all of you? - Yeah.
we get together every couple weeks, we shift, we run in the woods.
now, hang tight. I'll come get you in a while.
Hey. - Hey.
I'll take a Tru Blood.
it's two parts O-neg, one part B-pos.
Thanks.
Hey, you okay?
trade you makers.
Pam is not so bad.
she'll probably let you feed off of a human.
bill made me drink nothing but Tru Blood forever.
Hey, I'm sorry this happened to you if you didn't want it to.
it's just, I know how awful and scary...
and lonely it can be.
but it gets better. It really does.
you know, I think the hardest part is that nobody gets you.
like Pam and Eric and Bill, they're all just so old.
and then humans, even if they love you, or
I mean, if they try, no, they don't get it.
been feeling fresh out of friends lately.
you could hang with me.
we can be girlfriends.
I feel crazy in my head. - Yeah, I know, I know.
when I was turned, I didn't understand at all.
I had all these impulses, and then I was hungry all the time.
it's like I can't see straight.
like there's all these beating hearts around me and...
I just wanna rip these people's fucking heads off and just drink out their insides.
it's like this haze of, I don't know, desire?
you can't think about anything else.
it's fucked up.
no. No, it's not.
no. No, listen.
I put myself through a lot of grief and, oh, God, a ton of blood tears before I realized that these feelings are not bad.
they're awesome.
no, I mean, at least they can be.
either way, they're part of who we are now.
and I feel like I am just now starting to figure out what it even means to be a vampire.
have you fed on a human yet?
how was it?
it was all right.
Yeah, uh, how fucking great is it? - Really fucking great.
better than sex, right? - Yeah, actually.
just wait
wait until you try feeding and fucking at the same time.
no, no, I don't know about all that.
no, I know.
but it's not just about the feeding and the sex and the power, but
I mean, we're gonna live forever.
we're gonna be young forever.
the world, it's, like, wide open to us.
Alcide? Are we gonna talk about the fact that I puked on your shoes?
Nope.
this is so damn messed up.
I don't remember ever being down this way.
turn left up ahead.
what if Nora orchestrated this whole thing?
she pretended to save us so she could send us to Russell?
and why would she do that?
Russell could be a powerful ally to her cause.
though he'd never agree to do it for free.
but if she were to serve the two of us up to him, then she'd be in a position to negotiate with him.
Yeah, well, that's not what she did.
she tried to get us out of the country.
well, that's what she said she was doing.
you're just being paranoid. - Then why is she still alive?
I don't know, Bill.
she's a traitor and a liar just like her brother.
take that back.
Hello? - Hey, guys. It's Molly, remember me?
just giving you a shout-out to let you know that your countdown has started.
our countdown?
Yeah, your iStakes are set to activate at dawn.
bummer, right?
there must be some kind of mistake.
no, I'm launching a test.
are your iStakes glowing?
Yeah, they're glowing. - Cool. That means we're good to go.
good luck.
and if you don't make it, it's been rad serving you.
peace out.
we don't have much time.
they took Russell inside.
we don't have much time. We should split up.
I'll take the north wing, and you take the south.
even at full speed, it's a lot of ground to cover.
Sookie, we'd like to thank you for getting us this far, but Eric and I will take it from here.
you can stay outside with Doug and Alcide.
Yeah, right. - We don't have time to worry about you.
first of all, I've seen enough horror movies to know you don't split up when you're in a big, scary asylum and there's a crazed killer on the loose.
second, I think it's fair to say that my microwave fingers and the sun are about the only things around here that seem to have any effect on Russell, so the way I see it, it's me protecting you from him, instead of the other way around.
third, I got a headache and I gotta pee something fierce, so
I'd just as soon get this over with.
we got us a wooden bullet here.
- Wooden bullets kill shifters?
sure, but so do regular bullets.
wooden bullets kill vamps, though. If they hit the heart.
maybe the killers are after vamps, too.
or maybe they got a grudge against supes in general.
you guys need anything else? - Nah, we'll be in touch.
Hey, uh, sorry about your friends, man. - Thanks, Jason.
bullet came from this direction.
Hey, you know what's fucked up? - I got a pretty long list.
no, all this supernatural shit, these killings.
they've been going on for years.
us humans just started paying attention 'cause the vamps came out of the coffin.
but before that, the supes had been killing people, making it look all natural, and we've been none the fucking wiser.
the vampires- they've been getting away with this shit forever.
looks like tire tracks.
bf Goodrich radials.
shooter stood right here and, boom, shot down those poor people in cold blood.
they never had a chance.
wolves have been here.
they come with Russell.
I don't like this.
you okay? - Yeah.
remind me to avoid peach schnapps in future.
turn left.
I've never been to New York City.
I'm just saying.
if I die, I will never have made it to the Big Apple.
new York City smells like pee and the people are rude.
Oh, my God.
it's okay, Doug. It's okay.
good Lord in heaven.
no, no, no, no, no.
seems like we're in the right place.
what's with the get-up?
it's the look. - For fangbangers.
never took you for no fangbanger.
I never took you for no vamper.
people change.
well, what do ya say?
go home to your mama, Hoyt.
what the fuck is wrong with me?
what, my blood's not good enough for you?
this way.
the morgue.
how convenient.
I saw it, too.
I saw the ifrit.
you saw it?
it was watching us.
I'm not crazy?
we've gotta get out of here.
no. We're protected here.
the walls are flame-retardant.
I installed a sprinkler system.
we've got to get the fuck out of here.
this is what it's been waiting for, to get us all together.
we are sitting ducks down here.
you're right.
you're fucking right.
I got a friend.
he lives on a house boat down on the Gulf.
maybe we could go there. Sergeant, what the fuck?
I gotta hand it to you. That performance was fucking brilliant.
no, I did believe him. He was right.
I saw that monster in the flames.
help me with him.
no way, Sergeant. I meant what I said.
that woman cursed us. We gotta get the fuck out of here. All of us.
I am sick of you crazy fucks.
now you either help me secure the prisoner, or get the fuck out.
God damn it, Bellefleur.
we're gonna get him some help.
come morning, we'll turn him in to local authorities.
I saw it, Sergeant.
the ifrit.
I thought I was hallucinating, but I saw it, too.
we killed those people and we can't undo it and now we gotta pay.
Hey, we were on drugs that night, Bellefleur.
jacked out of our minds.
course you were seeing things.
but let's get one thing real clear.
there is no fucking "uh-freet.
Eller is just some poor sick fuck who likes to light fires 'cause he can't stand to live with himself.
okay?
Yes, sir.
where have you been?
well, I will tell him.
we're being watched. - I can't do this. I'm sorry.
holy shitcakes.
I'm so fucking sorry, but this is crazy.
please help me. Don't take me.
it's not my turn. I'm too skinny.
I was on Atkins and I lost 40 pounds.
take the others, please. Please.
fatties first.
where do they take the prisoners? - Down the hallway.
there's screaming and then there's not.
I'm not going. I'm staying here.
please get me down from here. I've got money.
I can pay you.
no, no.
you ready?
come back! Don't leave me here!
please!
I tried calling- - Sam, I'm sorry.
but this is a bad time, okay? - Luna...
Suzanne and Emory, they're dead.
they were shot tonight.
do you know anybody who would want to hurt them?
no.
they're wonderful people.
who could've- Baby.
Hey, listen. I wanna know how I can be here for you.
thank you.
I know things have been hard between us
what was that? - Nothing. It's Emma.
she's been having trouble sleeping lately.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry, but you should probably go.
okay. - Okay.
I'm gonna come check on you tomorrow.
okay. - Okay.
come here.
okay.
Hey, shifter!
got him!
the only good shifter is a dead shifter - Sam! - Luna, no!
Oh, my God, Luna.
mommy! - Emma, run!
get the shifter!
run!
there are traitors in our midst.
those who seek to tear down all that we have built together.
now, as Guardian, I am tasked with not only our political future, but the spiritual salvation of vampires everywhere.
the question before us is: are we willing to share this world?
as vampires, we have committed crimes against humanity, crimes for which we must now atone.
the Sanguinistas want to turn the clock backwards, want to murder with impunity.
they think of humans as nothing but sustenance.
so the choice is ours.
do we to return to a time where we skulked in the dark hiding in the shadows?
or are we willing to extend the promise of Lilith and the bountiful mercy to all of humanity?
and live... as equals?
the Sanguinistas say we are going against our nature, that Lilith commands us to feed.
the pinnacle of the food chain.
Tara, please. Please.
but they are wrong.
get off of him.
for if we let our sins flourish... - What the fuck's your problem?
if we are slaves to our blood lust, if we let our hunger for power surpass our common decency, we doom our souls to damnation.
so let it be known...
we will not cede the floor to the depraved and desperate tyranny of madmen and fanatics.
we will not stand by while zealots hijack the righteousness of our cause.
we will fight.
and let the night cleanse us of our sins and lead us to victory.
took you long enough.
what an infernal racket you people have been making.
miss Stackhouse.
always a pleasure.
to what do I owe?
fuck you, you psychotic piece of shit.
Hello, old friend.
do you remember me?
we've come to finish what we started.
well...
as my great love Talbot used to say when we were buck hunting, give it your best shot.
I know it no, my weren't they?
- so. - pretty much you?
you're just what the doctor ordered, my twee fairy vixen.
Yes, there is that aspect of you which I loathe.
look at me.
I wanna be the last thing you ever see.
he dies, we die most certainly.
but if we take him back alive, maybe we don't have to die.
unlikely.
bu Maybe you're ready to die.
maybe you're just bored after a thousand years.
but you do not make that decision for me.
we will take over from here.
okay, show's over.
Tara, that's enough.
well, I guess that whole "friendship" thing's on hold.
what do you expect when you come into my house and fuck with me?
come with me.
Yeah. No.
this is not your house. It is mine.
you work here, got it?
Yes'm... Missy Pam.
you did good out there fighting. Made me proud.
proud the way a human is proud of a well-trained dog.
nothing more.
No!
Oh, God. He's dead! That motherfucker
Eller was right, you fucking prick, and you just got him killed!
that's enough, Private! - Go fuck yourself, Sergeant!
you better hope you are not around when I am fully restored.
and, oh, I will be. Authority.
what fucking authority do you have? Given to you by, what, Lilith?
you idiots! You're no better than humans with your absurd, magical thinking.
there is no Lilith.
that is blasphemy.
you're fucking worse than human.
you might as well be praying to leprechauns or unicorns or the motherfucking Kardashians.
that makes just as much sense!
Nate, you fucking dumbass.
J. D.put up a hell of a fight till he heard those two wolves dying.
he ran like a fucking squirrel.
wolf and human are here. Why?
Doug led us here.
we found them parked in a van outside of Shreveport.
we took the van to get here with them in it.
you could cover that much distance by yourselves much faster than by driving.
we had another human with us that we needed because he'd remembered coming here before. Doug.
they know too much.
nothing that a little glamouring won't take care of.
do it.
Parker, make sure it happens. - Yes, sir, General.
Sookie, look me in the eyes.
bill, are you
let's just get this over with.
we owe you, wolf.
you will remember nothing of this night, nothing of me or Eric.
it will be as though we never met.
who is Doug?
Oh, God. That's me.
I understand you have been brought here once before.
Yes, by a vampire. A woman.
but I don't want to remember. I want to forget.
I can identify her. I'll never forget that face.
Yeah, or the look in her eyes when she said we were all gonna die for the glory of God.
see, they remember her. So why don't you just let me go?
as soon as your interrogation has been completed.
and then will you please do that thing that you do so that I won't remember any of this?
Yeah. - You have my word.
that's good.
you will remember nothing of us showing up tonight or anything that happened afterward.
and you will always protect Sookie with your life.
Yes.
but you'll keep your hands off her, romantically speaking.
she kind of disgusts you.
okay.
and you will live your life as you were meant to live it.
in the sun.
with others like you.
human.
get your fucking hands off me!
sir, you've lost a lot of blood. You need to remain still.
what?
Hey.
Oh. Hey there.
Oh, baby girl.
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.
grandma's got you now.
come on in.
what are you doing?
I'm exercising my constitutional right to be a dirty fangbanger.
well, you look ridiculous. - Yeah.
that's one opinion.
you can't get me down, Jess. Not tonight.
I'm just so happy. - Really?
I learned something tonight.
you wanna know what?
I don't think it matters if I do or don't. I think you're gonna tell me anyways.
you still care about me.
Oh, Hoyt.
no, you woulda let Tara drain me, - but you didn't.
no. You don't wanna be in love with me, but you are.
this is so pathetic. It's okay.
and I know you wanna be "more of a vampire." That's okay.
you wanna feed on me 24/7, I love that.
you can be as rough as you wanna be
Hoyt. We're over.
you hear me? It is never gonna happen.
that's what you say.
but what's in your heart is something
Yeah, you gonna glamour me?
you wanna hypnotize me into doing anything that you've ever wanted to do with a human being, no matter how depraved? I don't give a fuck.
but will you please just do it with me?
Hoyt, this is not you.
this is me, God damn it! - Dude, chill.
why are you crying?
where the fuck are we?
how did we get here?
no one thought you two would actually be able to deliver Russell Edgington.
guardian will be extremely pleased.
pleased enough to not execute us?
only Lilith knows that. - As only She knows all.
enough with this religious bullshit already.
Lilith can fucking blow me.
and why are you suddenly so into it?
I'm just covering my ass.
Yes, sir.
terrified I think I saw Russell fucking Edgington.
ladies and gentlemen, please accept my apologies for the inexcusable acts of the vampires that have terrorized you.
will we receive any kind of financial restitution?
I just wanna get out of here. - Of course.
please fasten your seat belts.
I had a dream you and Mom were still alive.
and Daddy, you called me "champ.
champ." Like you used to.
only I had forgotten you ever did that.
how could I forget that?
it always made me feel like I was something you were proud of.
Yeah, it made me feel good.
not in a making-me-forget-all-the-bad-stuff-I'm-feeling kind of way.
I'm used to it now.
but in a...
I'm-just-feeling-good-about-myself-and-that's-all kind of way.
I'd forgotten what that even feels like.
I swear to God and to you both,
I will find that vampire that killed you...
and I'll make him pay for what they did to our family.
the only thing you have to fear is...
besides, the Pope has denounced gay marriage.
morning.
coffee and Advil's over there.
if you want something to eat, you're gonna need to make it yourself.
you okay? - No.
honestly, I can't even remember the last time I was okay.
totally okay.
anything you need? - A fucking normal life.
wow, we, um...
drank a lot last night, huh?
not enough.
did, um...
did- - did we? - No.
some other stuff happened.
what kinda "other stuff"?
did you just recoil from me? Why?
fucking Eric. Close your eyes.
fucking J. D. - Thank you.
fucking wolves on V again.
Russell fucking Edgington? Fuck.
what the fuck is wrong with Eric and Bill?
they purposefully kept him alive.
explain to me how that makes sense in any fucking universe.
there's no way I could ever explain either one of them.
there's no way I can sit around and watch it happen again.
it's fucking Jackson all over.
Bye. I'm just gonna stay here and quietly slip into a coma.
sir-- How you feeling?
Emma-- I saw her.
she got away. I saw her.
sir, I'm gonna have to ask that you go back.
lady, I need a chair. - Where did she go?
you need to reconnect your IV.
if whatever is in my IV is important, you can bring it from my room to me here.
sir, that's just not how it's.
you're not gonna be able to keep me away from her, so don't even try.
I will find Emma. I promise you.
okay.
why would--who would want to kill shifters?
who even knows about shifters?
only other supes. Wolves.
no, Luna, they were human.
I think there were about four of them.
now, I didn't see much. They were wearing masks.
but I smelled whiskey, chewing tobacco, bad breath, bad diets.
mommy! - Baby. Oh, my God.
mommy, are you okay?
ma'am, only family members are allowed.
you need to get away from me before I hurt you.
she ran to my house, several miles, through some bad parts of town.
she came to me as wolf.
I'm sorry, Mommy. My Barbie, who is a wolf, told me to.
just because she is a wolf does not mean that you can have her.
I only want to be a part of her life.
mommy? - Yes, baby?
grandma promised me that you would get better if I'm not too loud.
what do you think I should do?
whoa, I think - I think this is between you, Martha, and Emma.
well, I guess I don't have much of a choice, do I?
honey, I'm her grandmama.
there's a piece of my boy in her.
but you're the one who gave birth to her. That ain't never gonna change.
I don't want to compete with you, even if I could.
I just don't want to lose her and Marcus.
there is someone after shifters.
can you keep her safe until we figure out who that is?
of course.
okay.
it fucking saw us. It knows who we are.
it's gonna come after us. It came after me.
Bellefleur, just shut the fuck up. You are spiraling.
stop the truck. - Why?
stop the truck. I gotta get out.
what, are you sick? - Stop the goddamn truck!
Hey!
Goddamn! Alone you are a dead man.
a dead man. I never shoulda done it.
Hey, hey. We need to have each other's backs at all times. Do you understand?
I never shoulda done it. I never shoulda done it.
dead check her.
we're fucking damned, Sergeant.
she put a curse on us.
we are cursed and there's no escape from it.
private, you listen-- Fuck you!
I'm not your goddamn Private no more!
you ordered me to do something evil and wrong that's gonna end up getting me killed.
and you, too, you stupid son of a bitch.
you're a fucking dead man.
Oh, man. I knew it was too good to be true.
Arlene and the kids.
I just ain't the kind of guy that gets to have something like that.
not for long, at least.
I'll see you back at the truck.
excuse me. Ruby Jean Reynolds?
I'm her son. Y'all called and said there was an emergency. Is she okay?
is she okay?!
Oh, Mama. - What?
they told me you had a seizure.
I did. - Well, is you okay?
I tell ya who's not okay.
I know. He dead.
well, that explains why he's not working around here no more.
but he in trouble, LaLa.
he come here last night. - I seen him, too.
somebody stitched up his lips.
but he wants to talk to you.
well, where he at? I.
he with an evil man.
made him drink goat blood.
that's what started all this mess to begin with.
that's a bad man. That's a bad man.
mama, how do you know all this?
I ain't got no fucking clue, baby.
electricity just runs through me. It always have.
I be seeing shit I ain't got no right to be seeing.
shit that I ain't even know what it even is.
but you gots to go. Jesus is in trouble. Save Jesus!
I will. I-- Jesus-- Jesus loves you.
even if you are an abomination.
just come here.
you been smoking that bone lately?
don't LaLa, tell Ruby J.
I gotta go, Ruby J.
Jesus loves you, LaLa. Through and through.
don't you ever forget that.
Jesus love the little faggots.
Bye, Mama. - Bye!
Yup, just up and left. Refused to tell me where he was going or what for.
but I know it has something to do with whatever happened to him in Iraq.
and he has never told you?
no, that door is shut tighter than bark on a tree.
girl, come to think of it, every man I've ever dated or married...
has had some sorta secret big ball of pain that they keep all to themselves.
honey, that is every man, period.
you know how they are. Well, hey, Sookie.
I just took an order from a man who could not keep his eyes off my tits - the entire time.
and his wife and two daughters were at the table.
men are just dogs.
dogs you cannot depend on for nothing, no matter how good they've been to you or how different you thought this one was.
cept for Andy.
cept for Andy, for now. - Shut up.
you can depend on them for one thing:
trouble. Insane, dangerous, never-ending trouble.
way more trouble than they're worth.
speaking of trouble... - Sook, hey. I need to talk.
are you out of your mind?
mama and Daddy died in a flood.
didn't you tell me Bill made it look like Mack and Denise Rattray's trailer got hit by a tornado?
vampires are pretty good at covering their tracks.
Jason, what even made you think-- Hadley told me.
you saw Hadley? Where? How is she?
how's Hunter? - Yeah, they're fine.
Hadley's working at this fairy nightclub that I went to.
fairy nightclub? Are you back on V?
no. And I knew they was fairies 'cause they blew me and Andy out of there with light bombs from their hands.
and Hadley told me they were.
and Hunter's there? - That's what she said.
we gotta get them out. Can you take me there?
well, I think it's in this big field out by the old Thibodeaux Farm, but it ain't really there.
whatever, fairies are bad news. They can mess you up big time.
they can, like, kidnap your life, let alone how butt-ugly they are.
right.
a hate crime? Are you serious?
the only four shifters I know of in the entire Shreveport area have all been shot in the last 24 hours.
somebody yells out, "Humans rule."
they're firing wooden bullets. - Which are meant for vampires.
well, maybe they think they're good for all supes, Andy.
the thing is, I can help you track 'em down.
Sam, you ain't had the proper investigative training.
listen, I can smell where somebody's been, if they've fired a gun.
I can smell fear, I can shift into anything I need to and give you the most heightened senses on the planet.
I can get into places a human can't.
Plus, I got a personal stake in this.
I can't condone vigilante justice.
fuck you, Andy. You're human.
you got no idea what it's like having people want to kill you just 'cause of what you are.
you either let me help you find these motherfuckers or I'll do it on my own. Your call.
God, he is such a fucking parody of himself.
I hate him.
check this shit out. That fucker killed Marcus.
got no right.
J. D. What the fuck are you doing here?
you ain't a member of this pack.
well, I don't remember resigning. - Yeah?
well, you gonna remember me kicking your sorry ass out.
goddamn right.
nice. Martha know about her?
don't you worry about me and Martha.
we got an arrangement.
that arrangement include you sucking down vampire blood like it's mother's milk?
the fuck?
you out of your fucking mind?
you're gonna get yourself killed.
not that I give a shit about that.
but you're gonna take down several of these wolves with you.
just like you did Nate and Woody already.
listen.
if you wanna continue what we started last night, I'll be happy to oblige.
I accept the role of master of this pack.
now you hold on.
you passed up that opportunity when you had the shot.
we got a new Packmaster now.
let me guess. You. - Me.
and just how did that happen?
well, ain't nobody challenge me.
then let me be the first.
and I know you're juicing.
I'll be damned before I let you take down my pack without a fight.
yeah? Where's your second?
you gotta have a second before you can challenge the master.
that's the fucking law. - There you go.
unless you think you're above our laws.
is that it? - Yeah, he does.
is this really the kind of guy you want to be your Packmaster?
hell no.
fuck, yeah. Yeah.
yeah?
well, which one of you's willing to be his second?
put your fucking meat where your bark is.
I will.
well, I guess I shoulda seen this coming.
cause you way too pretty to not be stupid.
yeah? What's your excuse?
you want punishment, Herveaux?
well, I'll be happy to give it to you.
just say when.
get the fuck out.
no welcoming party?
that can't be good. - At least it's not a firing squad.
congratulations, boys.
hail the conquering heroes.
Roman is very impressed. Please.
and we don't need these anymore.
our heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to you both.
Kay, stand still. Don't wanna accidentally activate this thing.
wouldn't that be ironic? - But funny.
I still can't believe you snagged that little psychopath alive.
you boys have certainly won me over.
have we learned who released Russell from the ground to begin with?
Salome has been interrogating Russell, but...
well, he's been a little tight-lipped.
we should know soon.
but for a moment, at least, let's celebrate.
would it be possible for me to speak to Chancellor Gainesborough?
chancellor Gainesborough has revealed her true Sanguinist leanings while you were gone.
anyway, I should go back to interrogating Mr. Edgington, who I'm hoping will provide us with a wealth of useful intelligence.
be careful. He's the strongest vampire I've ever met.
Oh, he's been silvered intravenously.
he's quite impaired. Trust me.
congratulations again, and thank you both for what you've done.
we will not forget. - It was our duty.
boy Scout. - Delinquent.
my boys, my boys, there are my boys.
from here on out, officially known as the guys who took down Russell Edgington.
how's that sound? Well done, well done.
Roman? That looks like a very special bottle of blood.
why, yes, it is, Rosalyn.
18th-century Austrian hemophiliac, not that I know too much about these fancy, antique bloods.
all I know is that it cost a fucking fuckload of money.
sit. Sit.
interesting.
you two have delivered a psychopath terrorist.
probably the greatest individual threat to vampire-human relations.
and, because of that, you have saved many, many lives, human as well as vampire.
so on behalf of them both, I thank you.
Cheers. - Hear, hear.
well, in all fairness, Guardian, we didn't really do anything except lead you to Russell.
Oh, no, no, no. You did exactly what I wanted.
now I know you're with me.
you do believe in coexistence with humans.
wholeheartedly.
there are certain humans I've felt protective towards in the past.
Yeah, but you do believe that the Sanguinista vision of morality endorses slavery, torture, the rape of those who delivered us into the life before death.
right?
well, I was never very religious, but as long as the affairs of humans do not personally impact me,
I do remain a pacifist.
you are just too cool for school to admit you believe in something other than yourself.
excuse me, I should continue interrogating our prisoner.
don't bother. We're going to execute him.
but-- We're at war.
just because we have caught one very visible enemy does not mean that the war is over.
I must admit I do find it ironic that we proponents of coexistence find it so very difficult to coexist with our enemies.
but the reason for that is simple.
they are evil, cloaking themselves in Lilith to justify their sadism, their greed, their lust.
Lilith herself was not evil.
Exigis 4: 19, "And blessed be the children of men, for they are banished from the night without end."
"they flame as sparks from a fire and last as long."
but, Guardian, he knows so much.
and I agree, execution is warranted.
why would we believe anything that he has to tell us?
and, oh, by the way, he is batshit crazy.
Yes, Guardian. - In fact, I want to execute him tonight.
as soon as possible.
I want to hit the links before sunrise.
has he been silvered? - Less than an hour ago.
shall I give him another dose and bring him to you?
excellent.
and slap an iStake on him. I don't want to get dirty.
guardian, I request permission to visit Chancellor Gainesborough in her cell.
Why?
she's my sister.
Oh my.
you will be at the execution?
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.
and you?
Oh, I love a good execution.
Holly said you were out here.
you can't even come back to the service alley to talk to me?
I got some bad news, darlin'.
okay.
did you find whatever it was y'all were looking for?
well, did you do whatever it was you needed to do with it?
Terry, I ain't Sookie. I can't read your mind.
Oh, baby, whatever it is, I wanna help you with it.
I'm cursed.
that ain't true.
I got a curse put on me in Iraq by a woman whose kid somebody in my platoon shot one night when we was partying.
just trying to relax a little in that fucking hellhole.
it was the 4th of July.
honey, there's no such thing as a curse.
and even if there was, why would she curse you?
you didn't shoot her kid.
cause I was aiming my gun at her head...
and then I put three bullets in her.
Oh, my God. - Patrick told me to do it.
I knew it was wrong and I did it anyway.
Oh, my God. - And now...
I'm being hunted by an evil smoke monster that wants to kill me and everyone I love.
that's what set our house on fire.
not that ghost Mavis like we all thought.
I gotta go, baby.
I gotta say goodbye to you and Coby and Lisa...
and Mikey. - Oh, Terry.
I can't put y'all in danger. You gotta cut me out of your life.
you've gone off your meds, haven't you? - No, this ain't about my meds.
this is about the worst thing that I have ever done, and now it is time for me to pay for it. - Now you listen to me.
I will help you through anything life can dish out, but I need you to pull your end of things.
I can't do anything if you aren't staying on your meds.
there's three little people who depend on me to survive.
three little people that I brought into this world, so I owe them.
and I need an adult to help me with that.
now, you want to go back to Meadowglade for a couple weeks, get yourself straightened out, get back on your medication, we can talk. But Arlene, if I stay with you, you will die.
and so will the kids.
then you need to go.
thank you.
thank you for taking a chance on me.
I wish it woulda turned out better.
where is it? - Uh, okay.
somewhere in this field. - Oh, that's helpful.
over here.
it's so frickin' bizarre.
it sounds like I'm right smack-dab in the middle of some sort of crazy nightclub.
but you're not.
fairies have cloaked it somehow, or it's some other dimension just next to us.
I know it doesn't make a lick of sense, but.
that's my sister, you fairy fuckers!
bring her back here!
come on, Jason.
Hey, that's my fucking tie! Hey, dude.
that's mine, man.
you can have anything you want.
come on, let's go. Come on, come on.
no. It's okay, you can keep it.
Oh, my God. I thought you were dead.
I was sure the vampires had got you for good.
is Hunter here? - Of course.
Hadley, you've got to get him out of here.
these fairies are gonna try to take him.
what? No. He's safe here.
they're keeping us both safe.
they're not what they seem.
Yes, but who is?
it's so good to see you again, Sookie.
uh, I don't think we've met.
Yes, we have. I helped you escape from Queen Mab.
who? - Claudine was my sister.
Really? No way.
that guy had meth teeth and bat ears.
because fairies naturally adjust to the standard of beauty to whatever frequency we're channeling.
that's the standard of beauty for fairy?
what, like your overgrown baby heads were so much better?
look, you take the dirt road out to the fork.
no, you turn left.
no, you go out there, you're just gonna end up in the field. Listen, I gotta go.
I gotta go. Y'all have fun tonight.
what can I do for ya, Sheriff?
you looking for something to help deal with the nonhuman criminal element? We got it all.
no, I just got a few questions.
okay.
people come in here, wanna kill vampires and, uh...other supes?
people wanna protect themselves from monsters, who some say have an unfair advantage.
we're just leveling the playing field.
and what do you mean by "other supes"?
nothing.
cause there's a lot of people wondering why the government does not acknowledge the existence of "other supes," as you put it.
I think people have a right to know.
what's your name? - Junior.
you sell wooden bullets, Junior? - We sure do.
with a silver core? - With or without.
do you keep a record of who you sell those to?
not unless they pay by credit card.
and most of our customers pay by cash.
how many wooden bullets would you say you sell, on average?
wooden bullets are one of our most popular items.
that ain't the question I asked.
go through about three cases a month.
how many bullets per case? - 500.
1, 500 bullets?
that's enough bullets for half the people who live in this whole parish.
Yep, I got some right here if you wanna see 'em.
Yeah.
Jesus tits!
I smelled him go into survival mode.
you just saved my life. You're welcome.
that's for Emory and Suzanne, you human piece of shit.
dude, your heart's slowing way down.
maybe we oughta call it quits.
no.
it's your funeral.
die, fanger!
yes we can! Jesus Christ. Hoyt Fortenberry?
I heard you was messed up with fangers.
well, it's your lucky night, 'cause we just saved your life.
sorry about Claudine.
she chose her fate. We all do.
some of my other sisters are here, though.
there's Claudette, Claude-Ellen, Claudwina... and there's Claudia.
Hadley, have you or Hunter eaten any light fruit?
relax. We do not believe in the harvest of humans.
that's why we escaped to your world before the last portal closed.
that and that cunt Mab's insistence that we dress like we're fucking Disney characters.
hadley is free to leave whenever she wants.
I don't wanna leave. Hunter's as safe as he can be here.
look, did vampires kill our mama and daddy?
I wasn't supposed to tell you.
did they? Is it true?
Claude... the one to tell her.
he ought to tell her. I mean, he told me.
now I have to tell her.
this will mean more trouble with the elders.
do you know which vampire it was?
all I know is what Claudine told me.
a vampire ambushed your parents.
he was drawn to them by something he smelled in the backseat of their car.
your blood.
no, I don't believe you. I don't believe any of you.
the First, The Last, The Eternal.
lord and Lilith, Father and Mother, protect me as I protect you, from this day until the hour of the true death.
this is a crime against vampires!
you have no right. You have no right!
I will make sure that you all pay!
Roman has decreed Russell's execution tonight.
they're executing him tonight.
Oh, so now you're acknowledging my presence.
it's happening.
it's finally happening, after all this time.
what is happening? - God's plan...
made manifest by Her.
Oh, thank you, Lilith.
thank you, She who transcends death.
Nora, did you know where Russell was?
did you release him? - No. It's a miracle.
it's all part of Her plan. She was right.
she's been right all along.
in the name of the Father and of the Mother.
in the name of my ass!
God and Lilith
you think you're any better than the Sanguinistas?
you use Lilith to justify your bloodlust for power just like they do to justify their bloodlust for humans.
you're both fucking hypocrites.
I am the only honest one here.
I wanna gorge on human blood not because some fucking Bible tells me to, but because I like it.
it's fun. It makes my dick hard.
are you done?
you were a pompous, self-righteous prick in the fucking Renaissance and you still are one today.
this is all about your ego.
this is about order... instead of chaos!
this is about mercy instead of sadism.
this is about balance.
this is about peace.
peace is for pussies.
praise Her.
excellent.
level one protocol!
you and me, together at last.
I don't understand. Why didn't it work?
Eric? Eric! - Kill him!
no, keep him alive!
he will be tried for what he has done!
Northman, are you alive?
chancellors, remain shielded.
praise you, Lilith.
guide us through darkness.
praise you, Lilith. It is your blood that gives us life.
it's okay, Nigel. Soon we'll be free.
we'll all be free!
prisoner secure.
the view from up here is spectacular.
he's supposed to be helping her, not zapping her again.
we are helping her. We're testing her luminescence.
all right, listen. I ain't been to med school, or fairy school or nothing.
so if you can put it in terms a "laid man" can understand, I'd appreciate it.
I'm going to send my light through her and if the fae in her is strong, my light will pass through her body unhindered.
well, send it on through.
what- is that bad?
cause- Her head- it lit up real good, I thought.
wake her up.
where am I? - You're safe.
like hell I am. You're one of the bitches that zapped me.
and you ain't much better.
Oh, it's okay, Sook. They've just been testing your luminescence.
my luminescence? What the hell's that?
you're depleting, Sookie. - Fuck you, I'm depleting.
I wanna go home. Come on, Jason. Let's go.
Hey, let's just plug her in and charge her back up.
whether you believe it or not, my family has been watching over your family for centuries.
just hear us out, okay? It's for your own good.
I'm going to ask you something. Please answer honestly.
have you been experiencing disturbances in your abilities?
disturbances like... - Like hearing thoughts.
sometimes it might be a strain to listen.
sometimes you can't hear much at all.
come to think of it, I have been a little off my game lately.
what we are and what you are, Sookie, is magical.
but as you are only half fae, your magic is finite.
you will run out if you aren't careful how and how much you use it.
what happens if I do run out? Would I die?
you wouldn't, but- - Would I be normal?
would I be human?
you would be fae no longer, yes.
thanks for an interesting night. Come on, Jason. Let's go.
Sookie, we fae are capable of things you haven't even begun to explore.
are you saying there's more shit she can do?
I hope we've at least convinced you of our trustworthiness.
if you're ever curious, if ever you find yourself questioning any of this, - you know where to find us now. - I do.
and I will, if I'm ever curious.
we should say goodbye to Hadley before we go.
when did you realize the shop keeper was reaching for his gun?
not till after Merlotte took him out.
Hey, sorry it took me so long.
I was at a lady friend's house tonight and I did not know how I was gonna get out of there.
I was even thinking about chewing my own arm off, but b thethenody call came in.
couldn't have worked out better.
what?
TMI, Coroner Spencer. - Sorry.
well, damn. Got him in a body bag already.
crossbow to the chest.
I would've liked to have seen that.
okay, so...
I forgot where we were.
where I was looking when he reached for his gun.
that's right.
where were you looking when he reached for his gun?
I was looking in the other direction, obviously.
you do realize that is not part of our training, Sheriff.
of course I realize that.
Jesus tits on Christ, this has got to be the worst night of my life.
just what in the hell are you looking for, Mr. Merlotte?
deputy, you got gloves on? Check this box.
and you are hoping to find what?
rubber masks.
folks who were going around shooting at people like animals, doing it wearing Obama masks as a disguise.
who knew bigots bought in bulk?
how'd you do that?
picking up five men, maybe six.
I'm smelling bad diets and hate and envy.
there something I need to know about you, Mr. Merlotte?
no.
I wish y'all hadn't seen me like that.
in a dark alley with a vampire sucking on my neck.
I feel like I lost every ounce of pride I ever had.
and I don't know when that happened.
it happened when vampires started coming out of the woodwork.
and the "lamestream" media wrapped its arms around them.
Mm-hmm, that's right.
and now they're trying to convince us that we oughta feel like shit about ourselves 'cause we ain't all special like they are.
the whole world's upside down.
it's like it's some sort of crime now, being a regular human.
talk about it. - Point is, Fortenberry.
it don't matter how you wound up here tonight.
it matters that you are here.
Joe Bob, I've known you since middle school.
and you guys, Ray, Tirese, I just met y'all tonight.
but right here, right now, I feel more love,
I feel more acceptance in this hate group than I ever felt at church or basketball or anywhere, for that matter.
that's what people don't get.
hate groups is about more than hate.
course, if they started to call them "love groups," nobody'd wanna be in one.
Yeah, yeah. That shit's for real.
it's Dragon.
Yes, Dragon?
who's The Dragon?
what was her name? - Who?
that vamper you was telling us about.
Jessica. - It's Jessica Hamby.
look, I don't know how I'm ever gonna forgive myself for letting her into my heart.
you have to, Fortenberry.
ain't your fault.
in fact, I'd bet good money that toothy-ass bitch hypnotized you into fucking her.
Yeah, it wasn't sex. It was date rape.
I don't know what it was, but I was sure as shit under her spell.
you know what? Don't matter.
only thing that matters is what's in your heart. Right now.
do you hate Jessica Hamby?
I do.
then we're here to hate her with ya.
they killed Junior.
what? - Who's Junior?
they shot him with a fucking crossbow, man!
no, I don't even- Junior? Junior's dead?
fuck! - No.
those sons of bitches!
motherfuckers!
whoever it was used us, Eric.
they used us to deliver Roman's killer right to him.
she must have broken Russell out.
it had to have been her.
you swore you never told her. - I didn't.
but I was with her while you were attending Russell's execution.
she knew what was coming.
I don't care how fucking old Russell Edgington is.
we both saw how fast he was on top of Roman.
and on me. There wasn't any silver.
and Nora was locked up the whole time.
she must have had an accomplice.
at least one.
Molly? Molly. - What's your problem?
are you a Sanguinista? - No!
then why didn't the iStake work? - That's what I'm trying to figure out.
are you loyal to Roman Zimojic?
you believe mainstreaming is the only path? - Of course.
you guys are whacked.
king Compton, Sheriff Northman.
chancellor Agrippa would like a word with you in her chambers.
gentlemen. - Chancellor Agrippa.
come in.
brother, I want you to- - Go fuck yourself, Nora.
I'll ask again. Please come in.
fangs. You're such boys.
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just want to make an entrance, is all.
Russell, enough. - Put your fangs away.
we're all friends here. - Like fuck we are.
Oh, I think we can be. I've changed my tune.
you killed my Talbot, but I forgive you.
now you go. - You slaughtered my entire family.
bygones. It's olive branch time.
I'm making an effort here. It would behoove you to respond in kind.
why should we believe you when no more than an hour ago
tell me, Northman. When you were hanging up there on one of those very proud unhoned Turkish marble columns, did you ever stop to wonder why I didn't kill you when I could have so easily?
I'm still wondering, actually.
it's because I have been born again.
made again in my new maker's image.
your "new maker." Of course.
Oh, no, brother. I would never - Stop calling me that.
you rescuing us from The Authority, our getting caught.
everything was a fucking lie!
Yes, I knew about Russell, but that's why I tried to save you.
because I didn't trust he wouldn't come after you.
Oh, ye of little faith.
not nice. Very disrespectful.
I dug Russell up.
how did you know where he was?
the night you were ordered to show him the true death, I followed you.
Why?
Russell Edgington was the only vampire I knew of powerful enough to take Roman Zimojic out.
power aside, you had unparalleled access to The Guardian.
if you wanted him gone, wouldn't it have been easier to do it yourself?
the Book is very clear on this subject.
the Guardian's blood is sacrosanct.
he alone shall determine when His Essence shall flow.
what happened tonight was inevitable.
but I say this with the deepest regret.
bullshit. You can't play the grieving widow and the leader of a coup at the same time.
I see you.
all you want is power. - No.
I want to share it.
with Nora, with Russell, with the two of you, with everyone.
too much vampire blood has been spilled in the singular pursuit of power.
but why?
when Lilith gives us more than enough to go around?
join us. Please.
never, you Bible-banging cunts.
what about you, Mr. Cotompn?
I still believe without that peaceful coexistence between our species, neither species will survive.
mainstreaming is the only way.
tomorrow night we're having a ceremony. An initiation, of sorts.
I still would like to give you the option to participate.
Oh, thank you, Salome. You've shown tremendous mercy.
no. Lilith has shown her mercy.
hell, yes, she has.
tomorrow night, then.
Yes. - Till tomorrow.
Alcide, what are you doing? It's half-time.
why do I get the sense that you're not taking your training seriously?
I don't know.
maybe 'cause my trainer's too damn distracting.
Oh, shit.
I told you me and J. D.had it out last night.
he damn near kicked my ass before he tore off.
being on V gives him too much advantage.
so what, then, huh? You saying you don't wanna fight him?
shit.
I'm gonna fight him 'cause it's the right thing to do.
but I'm prepared to lose and you need to be, too.
what if we got you some vampire blood? - No, way.
it'd just be the once to level the playing field.
then we could clean this pack up. - I said no fucking way.
I don't know what kind of experience you've had with V, or if you've ever known anyone on it, but it's not just a drug.
it's like swallowing death.
you take it and you're dead inside.
so is it even worth training?
probably not.
training hard, I see. - It's a close session.
I asked J. D.about what you accused him of last night.
you mean about him being a V-fiend?
and what'd he say to that?
he looked me in the eye and swore on my son's grave it wasn't true.
respectfully, Martha, your son doesn't have a grave 'cause y'all ate him.
don't get literal on me, Rambo.
I'm gonna tell you a story.
my husband was Packmaster.
when he died, J.D. was next in line.
not a wolf in this pack would've challenged him.
but out of respect for me and my husband, J.D. desisted.
instead, he devoted himself 100% to my Marcus.
to teaching him what only a he-wolf can teach.
you gonna deny any of this? - I can't.
it's all true. But, Martha- - It's J. D.'s turn now.
he has more than earned it.
Emma, sweetie. Come here.
he's on V, Martha.
it's a lie. You can still bow out.
let's go get you something to eat.
I, Terry Bellefleur, take thee, Arlene Fowler,
to be my lawfully wedded wife.
to be my lawfully wedded wife.
to have and to hold
Arlene, I just want you to know...
that you make everything right and worth it. Everything.
and I'm gonna do my damndest to be strong for you.
for as long as I live. I promise.
you beat me to the altar, you bastard.
but seriously, cuz. Congrats. Way to go.
way to go.
Hey, Arlene.
sorry to just talk to Arlene but Terry, you're a guy, so I doubt you'll ever even see this.
here you are, hon. You gonna help with setup,
wait, am I on TV?
and I just wanna say I am so proud of you.
you inspire me and you remind me that everything happens for a reason.
sweet. - Meant every word.
Oh, wait, wait. You have to see this- - Oh, I gotta see this.
uh, congratulations, guys.
if I don't seem all that happy, it's only 'cause I wish Sook was here, too. You know?
man, she'd be so happy for you.
I could see her little- little
well, hello, out-of-towner.
excuse me, Hoyt.
uh, Terry and Arlene, we're very happy for you.
Yeah, we really, really are.
you know, maybe one day, if, um, you know, we're lucky, you'll get to help us celebrate.
I had a vampire at my wedding.
you have grown.
sup, Mikey, Mikey.
now later on when you do the math about when you was born, and when Mommy and Daddy made you, don't sweat it 'cause you was made out of love, baby boy.
what's the matter with you?
why do you always have the need to say something inappropriate?
he always has the need to say something inappropriate.
cause I is who I is.
Ka, bitch, ka.
and I love who you is.
and I love you for it.
and last but not least...
look at your dress!
God, I was fat.
what a pretty little dress. - You were not.
I wanted a drink that night so bad.
um, who are we missing?
Sam! Sam! - Oh, fuck.
of course, Sam. Sam Merlotte, where are you?
over here! Over here, congrats! Congrats, cheers!
thank you, Sam Merlotte, for giving us this bar!
well, just to be clear, the bar is still mine, all right?
I'm giving it to you for one night only.
who kns owwith her? Give her an inch, she'll take a mile.
all right, all right. Here, here!
Cheers!
no, I can't
Oh, honey. Oh, honey, honey. Come here.
I was so happy that day.
but not as happy as I should've been.
I had it all.
I didn't even know it.
you can still get it back.
he's crazy, Holly.
as in, off the deep end.
no, Arlene. What he is is PTSD.
okay? There's a big difference between that and crazy.
no, you didn't see him last night. He looked like shit.
and then he was telling me that there's this spirit made of smoke that's chasing him 'round the country, hunting him down.
that doesn't sound crazy to you?
not necessarily. - Not necessarily?
look, after everything we've been through, we both know there's all kinds of things out there.
things we don't understand.
now, I'm not saying it is for real.
I'm just asking, are you gonna be able to live with yourself if you give up on that man and it turns out that it was?
well, fuck you and your tough love.
sorry, babe.
knock, knock.
what time is it?
uh, it's just before noon.
shouldn't you be at work? - Yeah, probably.
I don't know how to make lunch so I made you breakfast instead.
uh, listen. About last night?
it's not your fault, Sook.
what are you talking about?
I'm talking about the shit we learned last night.
about your blood being in the back seat and all.
it has to be on your mind. Don't tell me it ain't.
I thought I was supposed to be the one who could hear thoughts.
you know, I always thought it was my fault.
I mean, we both did.
Jason, I never said anything to - I know you didn't, Sook.
that's my point.
I mean, not once, in all these years, have you ever treated me like their dying was on me.
we were so young and and it was so unfair.
and still you- you never even slipped.
today, we know the truth.
but I will be damned if I let you take that on because you never let me.
and I love you for it.
I love you, too.
and yes, you can eat my bacon. - Yeah.
Andy? - Hey, Sheriff Dearborn.
I was wondering if we could talk.
I ain't the Sheriff anymore, Andy. You are.
and now ain't exactly a good time.
look, I'm having a crisis of confidence and I could use some advice.
we got some killers out there, a whole group of them.
and they're going after shit I don't even understand.
and I keep feeling like...
do I suck at this, Bud?
when I retired, did I say anything to you about dropping by any time you damn well felt like it?
cause I don't remember having that conversation.
come on. Water's 103, just like you like it.
I'll be right there, sweetie.
like I said. Not a good time.
Where's, uh- where's Lynn? - Riverboat gambling.
look, Andy, I get that the job's stressful.
I did it for 43 years. But I'm retired now.
the wife's out of town, the hot tub's just right, and I've got an experimental male enhancement ointment I'm anxious to try out.
so, go on.
get out of here and let a man relax.
been expecting you.
Hola?
Hello?
shit.
Hello? Hola?
Hola!
Hello?
Oh, Lordy. Have mercy on my soul.
have mercy on the whole messed up human race.
my Jesusito, he had a gift.
your Jesusito had a shitload of gifts.
but you wouldn't know that, would you?
he spit on this family when he gave away our gift to you.
tonight, I spit back.
tonight, I will take back what belongs to me.
I spit first, you sick fucking fuck.
I feel fine, Sam. I should be out there helping you.
I already told you, I'm on their trail.
when I come across any of these fuckers, ain't a chance in hell they're gonna get away.
but- - Like it or not, Luna, you're safer here.
it also happens to be where you belong.
so you can get back on your feet, move Emma home where she belongs.
Hey. Bad timing?
actually, your timing's perfect.
Sam's had about all he can take of me.
not much of a patient, are we?
I'm a raving lunatic bitch. - Ooh, you said it.
well, I got junk magazines, junk food, 'cause I know how awful hospital food can be, and then, of course, the flowers to class this up a bit so I don't seem so W. T.
thank you, Sookie. I love all of it.
but right now, it's all about the Sonic.
how you holding up? Get any sleep?
what the hell's sleep? - How about I buy you a cup of coffee?
word around town is you're some kinda bulletproof superhero or something.
my friends got shot and killed for no other reason than they were different from the people doing the shooting.
and they shot at me and Luna for the exact same reason.
and, fuck, Sookie. They even went after her daughter.
you know, girl's only eight?
is this the kind of world she's gonna grow up in?
people are scum.
I'll be honest, Sam. That doesn't sound like much of a superhero speech.
Yeah, well, I didn't ask to be called a hero.
super, bulletproof, or otherwise.
thank you for this.
can I ask you something? - If you dare.
say you could trade in what you are and give away everything that's special about you for a plain old regular life.
would you?
well, the me I wish I was would say no way.
he'd say "You gotta keep on fighting stupidity.
and every mind you change is one less dumb fuck on the bad guy's side.
but the me I'm afraid I'm becoming...
I'm feeling a lot less optimistic I can effect the kind of change that make a squirt's piss of difference in this world.
and I'm so fucking tired of fighting.
I'm with you there.
but, I wonder- I mean, would it go away?
would what go away?
wouldn't all the hate still bother us?
we'd still be able to see it, right?
I don't know.
I do know one thing.
the world would be a much safer place for the people I love.
if I was normal, a lot more of them would still be alive today.
we can "what if" all we like.
in the end, we are what we are.
I guess.
you know, that looks good. I think I'll have cup, too.
Tara, it's me, baby. Your mother.
I know who you are.
I wasn't sure if you would.
how could you, Tara? - What?
how could you do this to me? - I didn't do shit to you.
this is a terrible situation you've put me in.
I'm a minister's wife now.
I can't have any daughter of mine being a vampire.
why are you here, Mama?
I came here to tell you that, from this day forward, you are dead to me, baby girl.
I came to say goodbye. - Oh, no.
you'll be seeing me again.
I ain't afraid of you, child.
I got Jesus at my back. - Well, la-dee-da.
I'm going. - Then go.
the Book tells us that to stake a Guardian is to turn your back on Lilith herself.
but what to do when that Guardian has already turned his back on her?
I believe...
Lilith forgives Russell Edgington for what he's done.
and so I do, too.
thank you, Salome.
I want everyone here to know just how awful I feel.
not so much about Roman. That was for the greater good.
but for what I said about Lilith...
I, universally, disavow myself of my statements.
I love Lilith.
praise her. - Praise her.
praise her. - Praise her.
praise Lilith.
how many times over the past decades have you heard Guardian Zimojic imply that we owed our very existence to humans?
that we evolved from them?
we didn't evolve from them.
shamefully, Roman believed we did.
Roman believed that this blood, her blood, the blood this very Authority was created to protect...
he called it symbolic.
it is not symbolic.
the Book tells us that Lilith met the sun by the hand of Man.
that on the ensuing night, her progeny collected her remains in an Earthen jar.
the blood has since been transferred, but this blood which Salome holds in her hands right now, it is the blood of Lilith.
nothing could be less symbolic.
whatever doubts any of us have will be erased.
tonight...
everyone in this room...
will drink from her.
This...is...blasphemy.
all of it.
I've served on this council longer than any vampire, save for Roman.
who are you to offer the blood of Lilith?
may Lilith forgive me.
she does. Anyone else?
give it to me. I'll drink it.
the blood of Lilith? Why not?
I'm like a tree in the wind. I am just so happy to be included.
we are of Lilith. Lilith is of God.
may she reveal herself to us tonight.
we are of Lilith.
are we really gonna do this?
it's vampire blood. We're vampires.
it's not gonna do anything.
I have to say...
I'm jealous of your disguise.
sorry, kiddo. You're gonna have to earn your stripes.
you kill your first newscaster on live TV, you can pick out anything you want.
where is she taking us? - Lilith is taking us. Only she knows.
well, I hope she figures it out soon 'cause I'm hungry.
we will walk where and when we want.
these streets are yours no longer.
we should eat you for the disrespect you've shown us.
but your heartbeat sounds like shit and your blood smells even worse.
but keep your hands off the horn!
I'll move. - No, it's okay. Sit.
sit.
you look good up there. You were right.
you're a better dancer than you are a bartender.
Thanks.
so your mom's a real bitch.
Yeah, I know she is.
but what are you gonna do?
she's still my mom. No, she's not.
not anymore.
can you believe this shit?
I fucking hate her but I'm crying for her anyways.
a hundred years from now you won't even remember her.
this I promise you.
okay, break's over.
time to get back up on that pole.
I loved my Jesusito.
he was special, but he was soft.
that's what drew you to him.
you saw in him something you wanted and you knew you could take it.
you wanted to be a brujo.
you stole my family's magic from my Jesusito.
you keep it locked away in your brain.
tonight I take it back.
blessed are the young.
you'll soon have everything you need, my son.
it's a boy.
full of spirit and energy.
he will do wonders with what I'm taking back from you.
my wife will drink the blood I collect from your brain.
you must think you're joining my Jesusito.
but, no. You don't get to be together.
Adios, maricoun.
pendejo!
I won't say who he is, but this vamper friend of mine, he says end of days is coming.
now, I can't tell y'all what to believe, but I will say this.
I believe him.
but what does he mean "End of days"?
a war...between vampires and humans.
and God be damned if you get caught in the middle.
so what the fuck do we do now?
we join him.
he's offering us an in.
we drink his blood and he knows he can trust us.
fuck it. I'm in.
what about you, little girl?
I'm scared.
Oh, now, don't be.
you take this, you grow up to be big and strong like me.
Emma? That is my granddaughter.
listen to me, Martha. It's the only way. You gotta believe me.
I don't know you no more.
Emma, honey?
you come with me.
what's up, y'all? Where's Joe Bob?
dragon had something else for him. Let's roll.
come on, Fortenberry. Hop in.
I've got a surprise for ya.
how do I look?
like a badass motherfucker.
let's roll. Let's roll. Let's roll!
Obama!
sir, visiting hours are over.
okay.
sir, I'm gonna have to insist. They've been over for two hours.
fine, fine. I hear ya. Jesus.
sir, you have got to go home.
sir?
you killed my friends, you son of a bitch.
so? You killed my friend.
he fucking deserved it and so do you.
closed FOR A PRIVATE PARTY - # And you...# - To the bride and groom!
# Light up my life...# - Congratulations.
Oh, what's wrong?
it's that vampire! Russell What's-His-Face!
mommy!
you should worry about you.
I'm freezing, Patrick.
that'd be pretty ironic.
two men waiting to die by fire, they wind up freezing to death instead.
I'm leaving a family behind. A good one.
I'm in no mood for irony, asshole.
seriously, why don't we just build a fire and get it over with? At least we'd be warm.
what the fuck? - What's your fucking problem?
God damn it.
No! - Fuck you!
come on back, you ifrit pussy!
Private- Did you see that shit? It was fucking laughing at us.
seriously! Come on back, you piece of shit!
private! - Stop privating me.
this ain't what we signed up for. The deal was, it was supposed to kill us.
I did not agree to be fucked with.
damn it, Bellefleur.
Terry, no. Don't.
why not?
I've already made my peace with it.
Really?'Cause you don't look like a man at peace.
fuck you. I'm gonna fucking do it.
no, you're not. And you know why?
cause suicide is for Muslims! And you're better than that.
you're a goddamn U. S.Marine.
it's taken everything from me and now it wants me to stew in it?
well, fuck him- her- it.
give me my gun. - Not another step, Patrick.
they would wanna know you died fighting. Not like this. Now, come on.
shit.
all right, all right.
fuck!
Hey.
I am so sorry, Bellefleur.
you have no idea how much I wish I'd never given you that order.
but you did.
Yeah.
Yeah, I sure did.
yeah? - Sorry to interrupt.
officer Stackhouse is here to see you.
Jason? Hey.
you been drinking?
Yeah.
well- hey, talk to me. What's going on?
my parents, they weren't- they weren't killed in a car accident.
they got killed by a vampire.
Oh, my God. - Yeah.
do you know who?
but I'm gonna find out.
cause there is something to be scared of inside my little girl.
Oh, my God. She knows everything I'm thinking.
what are you? - What are you?
you're definitely not human.
I don't know what I am. - Maybe I'm an alien.
the fae were known for breeding with humans, Sometimes against the humans' will.
my people are rapists?
you're depleting, Sookie. - Your magic is finite.
you will run out if you aren't careful how and how much you use it.
would I be normal? Would I be human?
you would be fae no longer, yes.
it's just so fucked up.
I mean, here I am...
and we are...
whatever we are.
and now I found out that
no. No, Jason. We are not all the same.
I- I guess, but- - No.
you taste funny.
is that blood on your mouth?
Oh, shit. Shit.
were you just feeding on somebody?
I didn't know that you were coming.
I am so sorry. I would not have done that
you're sorry? Jesus fucking Christ, Jess.
is he here? - Jason, do not make a scene.
why not? I think I deserve to know whose blood I just tasted.
what's his name? - I don't know.
course you don't.
what's your name, son? 'Cause she sure as shit don't know.
go back to my room. - Don't.
go! - Don't!
you know, you say you're not all the same, but really, what's the difference?
I mean, you just drank from some dude you don't even know.
Yeah, and I suppose you know every cow you've eaten.
what the fuck kind of question is that?
I ain't never fucked a cow. - Oh, it's a metaphor, idiot!
Hey, fuck you, fanger.
move in!
ms. Hamby, awaiting your order.
you shot me in the head.
so what? It'll fucking heal.
so will I.
get the fuck out of my mansion.
what the hell?
this is wrong.
you know this...
but your sister does not.
save her, my son.
what the hell just happened? - We saw her.
we saw Lilith.
you saw her. You were there.
and so was Godric. And it sickened him.
the Godric you say you saw last night was a perversion.
Lilith will show you the way.
there may be a way we can find out who killed your parents.
first I was Mama, then I was the vampire.
you saw Claudine?
Warlow, leave the girl alone!
does Warlow mean anything to you? - No.
you are mine!
she is here. She'll lift the curse if
Terry, baby, you got to kill Patrick.
or either he got to kill you.
one of us has got to die.
this vampire friend of mine, we drink his blood and he knows he can trust us.
you're a drug addict and you're a disgrace to all wolves.
Jd, don't! You have won.
find yourself a new pack.
I was in my room, and the next thing I know I'm you.
you'll be okay. - No, I won't.
I'm gonna die, Sam.
we got a surprise for you, Hoyt.
now, you need to do this, brother.
you did it?
I'll send help. A friendly face.
it's time to start crushing the mainstreamers.
true Blood. You bomb the factories.
there are only five of them.
and you force mainstreamers to feed on humans.
as they were meant to. - Well done.
what are you doing? - Evolving.
we're looking at a Tru Blood factory outside Houston, Texas, where an explosion occurred about an hour ago.
the cause is still undetermined, but early reports indicate that there have been at least six human casualties.
the Houston plant is the largest Tru Blood factory in the world, producing more than a quarter of the world's supply of the synthetic blood beverage that vampires need to survive.
it's begun.
praise Lilith.
in celebration of her holy war, let us feast in Lilith's name.
should we say Grace?
well, prayer is a fairly new concept to me.
perhaps someone with a little more experience should do it.
it would be my honor.
here's a tried and true one from my human days.
there once was a cock and a hen who gave lunch to a goose in a pen.
"good Lord," said the goose, "bless this food for our use and us to Thy service."
Amen.
charming.
access denied.
chelsea, Chancellor Agrippa must have forgot to clear me.
is there any way you can?
level one protocols. Sorry, hon.
gotcha.
Oh, please. I'm a thousand years older than you.
put the baby fangs away before you piss me off.
is there somewhere safe we can talk?
be safe in here if you let me go.
we got 30 seconds before we're leaving again.
please tell me you have a plan to get us outta here.
uh, you were it. - Well, that's great.
level one protocols. I only have level three clearance, genius.
the lockdown system is DNA specific. - I don't speak techie.
translate. - We're totally fucking fucked.
unless...
unless what?
it's probably a really stupid idea and it'll probably get you killed.
sounds perfect.
you see anything?
Yep.
one fine-ass motherfucker with pretty new eyelashes.
lafayette, seriously. There was a creepy spirit thingy in this bathroom.
now, are you gonna help me find out what it was or are you just gonna stare at your vain-ass self all night?
okay.
creepy spirit thingy, why you in Sookie bathroom?
Hello?
I'm sorry, Sook. I ain't got no goddamn clue how this shit work.
I ain't Whoopi Goldberg in "Ghost,"
although I am way prettier.
well, thanks for trying.
I'm still gonna charge your ass 100 bucks.
put it on my tab.
so... other than getting possessed by a Mexican demon, how've you been? You heard from Tara?
I texted her about 50 times, and this all she wrote
bitch, stop texting me or I will eat you.
sounds like she's doing better.
she ain't been pissed at me this long since I stole her boyfriend in eighth grade.
well, she'll get over it someday.
or she won't.
at least she's alive.
sort of.
what? - I said at least she's alive.
not you. Shh.
y'all need to simmer the fuck down, shit!
I can only listen to one of y'all at a goddamn time, fuck.
Oh, excuse my language, Mrs. Stackhouse.
gran? Gran's here?
it's-- Yes, ma'am, I will tell her.
the rest of y'all, I ain't Gmail for dead bitches.
send your own goddamn messages, hell.
your gran says she is glad those striptease fairies is looking after you.
did she say anything else?
like who Warlow is or what that thing was in my bathroom?
sleep on it.
you sleep on it?
you're sleeping on top of it. You're sleeping on top of it.
for, like, the hundredth time, Hoyt is not an Obama.
the only reason any of this happened is because he still loves me.
he joined a hate group.
he tried to kidnap you, pointed a gun at you.
Oh, yeah, that's real romantic.
Yeah, well, at least he didn't shoot me in the head.
thanks for showing up, Officer Stackhouse. - Well, I came as soon as I heard.
Hoyt's an Obama? - No!
Oh, he's a regular Prince Charming.
ran off to save his own ass.
it was daylight, all right? He went to go get help.
Jason, they must have done something to him.
Hoyt's had your blood, right?
so if he's in danger, you'd feel it, right?
I did, all right? But then he just went blank, and I can't.
I can't feel him at all anymore.
I did this to him, okay?
and if anything happens to him, it's 'cause of me.
here.
I don't think it's gonna happen again.
you sure?
no.
but I stopped getting pins and needles all over my body, so that's a good thing, right?
I'm-- I'm taking you back to the hospital.
my brother died from skinwalking.
your brother was beaten to death. - And they just dug a bullet out of you.
so stop making me waste my energy by arguing.
I'm not going back to the hospital.
okay.
okay, then you're staying here and I'm getting somebody to take care of you.
while you're out chasing the Obamas?
you know, in case you hadn't noticed, the Renard Parish Sheriff's Department aren't exactly CSI.
they need me. - Uh-huh.
and in case you haven't noticed, I'm not exactly fragile.
those cocksuckers shot us and they tried to shoot my daughter.
so if you think I'm just gonna lie here in bed like "The Princess and the Pea..."
Luna - ...then you're dead wrong.
I'm coming with you. You can't stop me.
you're really fucking annoying, you know that?
and you're old-fashioned and surprisingly sexist.
trying to protect somebody I love-- that's sexist?
I love you, too.
good. - Still coming with you.
God damn it!
well, last ghost lady Lafayette channeled tried to steal our baby.
why should we trust this one?
because I shot her in the head.
well, so what?
that was a long time ago and it wasn't your fault.
and you're very sorry. He is very sorry.
please, please, don't make him do this.
honey, you're gonna wake up the kids.
what-- what are you doing?
me and Patrick, we saved each other's lives.
he's a good man.
Oh, is that why he ran out of here like a scalded dog?
looked to me like all he was thinking about was saving his own hide.
survival brings out the ugly in all of us.
I'm gonna offer him a fair fight.
it's the least he deserves.
what about us?
what about Mikey, okay?
what about what we deserve?
baby, if it wasn't for you...
you're the only reason I'm fighting at all.
the fire is still raging at the Tru Blood factory outside Houston, Texas.
meanwhile, panicked vampires across the country rush to stockpile the beverage.
and many human citizens are already asking the question:
what will happen to them when the artificial blood runs out?
what are you doing?
we should have enough Tru Blood to last us a couple of weeks if we stop serving it now.
we're not going to stop serving it.
you've seen the news, right?
factories burning, vampires panicking.
which is exactly why we need to keep serving the blood.
so our vampire customers don't eat our human customers and put us out of business.
what happens when we run out?
we do what every sane vampire in this country is gonna do,
pretend to still be drinking the shit like good little mainstreamers, and in private we discreetly feed on humans.
it's gonna be a bloodbath out there.
whoever blew up that factory, that's what they want, isn't it?
there are two things I try to stay away from:
humans who eat a lot of fish and politics.
so whatever comes next, we keep our heads down, our tits up, and the Tru Blood flowing.
understand?
Hey, I may be, like, a week old, but I'm not an idiot.
you're worried about Eric.
if you need someone to talk to.
just because we drank a bitch together does not make us Oprah and Gayle.
get the fuck back to work.
suck me, vampire Barbie.
Hey, I have a great idea.
why don't we blow up all the Tru Blood factories and start a civil war?
wouldn't that be fun?
praise Lilith.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing, Bill, but
it's not a game. - Shut up.
there aren't any cameras in here.
you're laying it on a little thick, don't you think?
Salome and Russell are thousands of years old.
and Nora may be young, but she's a political genius.
that's why Godric chose her.
if you think they're gonna buy this act much longer, you're as crazy as they are.
what if they're not crazy?
what if God is a vampire?
I saw Lilith. We both did.
and we were high.
I don't know what's in that blood, but we need to stay away from it.
I'm lost.
I don't know who to trust.
everything I believed in has been turned upside down.
what about Sookie?
she just food to you now?
I didn't think so.
you're more of a mainstreamer than I'll ever be.
and whatever religious crisis you think you're having, you can have it somewhere else.
we're getting the hell out of here.
now, the compound's on lockdown.
there's only one way out.
the chancellor's blood.
you want me to steal Salome's blood?
what about your sister? - I'll handle Nora.
it's our only shot.
tomorrow before dawn.
we'd better get back to slaughtering people in the name of God.
gran's photo albums, my parents' baby pictures, their obituaries
I-- I don't understand.
I've been through this stuff a zillion times.
what am I supposed to be looking for?
shit knows, Nancy Drew.
what is this? - Jason's report card.
it's the only B he ever got.
gran knitted a frame for it.
what are you trying to show me, Gran? What am I not seeing?
Lynn Dearborne was Jason's sixth grade teacher?
sheriff Dearborne's wife? - Uh-huh. Jason was her favorite.
it didn't matter how many tests he flunked or cheated his way through, he was every female teacher's pet.
the boy could charm the skirt off a post. Used to drive me nuts.
the bodies of Michelle and Corbett Stackhouse were discovered by Deputy Bud Dearborne of the Renard Parish Sheriff's Department.
bud Dearborne found my parents' bodies?
how come I didn't know that?
he was there.
maybe this is what Gran's trying to tell me.
that Bud Dearborne knows something.
she could have just said so.
dead folk, why y'all gotta be so cryptic?
it ain't cute.
Hey, don't let her out of your sight.
I don't care if she's sleeping or taking a dump.
Jason, I don't take dumps.
and I'm gonna be fine. Don't worry about me. Only worry about Hoyt.
I still can't feel him. It's like there's nothing, just emptiness.
and, God, it's like he's asleep or
don't even say it.
I wish I could stay and help.
well, being a vampire's got its perks-- the no dumping and all
but getting deep-fried when the sun comes up sure evens the playing field.
look, I got this covered. It's what I'm trained for.
Hoyt's gonna be fine.
promise me.
promise.
okay.
Joe Bob visited this same website over 500 times

the Human Patriot Manifesto, Part 1.
vampires and other covert mutants are stealing our jobs, buying our politicians, controlling the media, and seducing our children.
if we have any chance of keeping America human, brave citizens like us have got to stand up and fight back.
Yeah, if they're so brave, then why the Obama masks, hmm?
cause it's like patriotic or ironic or something.
maybe it's 'cause they don't wanna get recognized.
God help us. - Amen.
Stackhouse. - Yeah.
check this out.
fuck me.
making soups outta supes!
obamas aren't just shooting shifters.
they're strapping vampires in the sun, melting 'em like marshmallows.
death to supes! Long live the Dragon.
long live the Dragon.
Aw, shit me.
they are dragons now, too.
not those kind of dragons. - That's what they say.
back in the day, old Cleetus Bodehouse used to be a Grand Dragon for the Ku Klux Klan.
the masks, the cross.
sick sons of bitches are modeling themselves after the Klan.
didn't Cleetus Bodehouse drown in his own bathtub like 20 years ago?
so who's the Dragon?
we find the Dragon, we find Hoyt.
who the fuck's the Dragon?
and what's he done with Hoyt?
fuck you. I ain't telling you shit.
Hey, easy, Stackhouse! - Fuck you, man!
get off him!
come on, man, easy. - Get up!
easy.
dude, we all wanted to be you in high school.
QB-1, drowning in cooch.
you were the man.
now look at you-- Bellefleur's bitch boy, screwing over your best friend for some cold, dead pussy.
you're such a fuckin' loser.
shut up, you dumb fuck!
vampires may be stronger and faster, shifters may be smarter, more adaptable, but wolves have something none of them do.
you know what that is, Alcide?
a pack, sir. - A pack.
that's how wolves have survived for thousands of years,
by putting the needs, traditions, and survival of our pack before our own.
but we aren't just wolves, are we?
we're men, too.
and women, Debbie.
inside each of us is both man and beast.
the man is selfish.
he wants the best piece of meat, the biggest house, the prettiest girl all to himself.
that's how humans are built.
but the wolf, the beast, he's connected to something greater.
he feels his brothers and sisters in his blood.
he carries them with him wherever he goes.
he knows our strengths and our unity.
today you're given the choice，
the choice all weres make when they come of age.
who will be your guide?
man or beast? Human or wolf?
will you carry the hopes, dreams, and survival of our pack on your shoulders or will you walk alone?
the choice... is yours.
my son...
your choice?
I choose pack.
Debbie Pelt, your choice?
I choose pack.
ginger ale for you, Sookie.
Thanks, Sheriff-- Mr. Dearborne.
how's retirement treating you? - Fantastic.
colon cancer's in remission.
had the last of the tumors cut out a month ago.
I'm glad to hear that.
anyway, about my parents,
I know you were the one who found them.
was there anything suspicious to you?
were there any marks on them?
bites?
if you're asking if it could have been a vampire.
I hate to say it, but the answer is yes.
of course, we didn't know about them at the time, so we assumed that gators must've gotten to the bodies.
I'm sorry.
I know you had a real special relationship with vamps.
but gotta be hard knowing they killed your grandmother and now maybe even your parents, too.
rene Lenier or Drew Marshall or whatever his name was killed my gran, not a vampire.
well, depends how you look at it, right?
I mean, she was killed 'cause you associated with vampires.
so, in a way, they might as well have been the ones who killed her.
you see what I mean? - No, I don't think I do.
she's probably reading your mind right now. She's onto you.
knows what you're hiding. Gonna ruin it.
just drink the damn ginger ale.
Oh, shoot! I am so sorry.
here, let me help you with that.
what are you doing?
does the name Warlow mean anything to you?
do you know who killed my parents?
Sookie, I got no idea what you're talking about.
let go of me, young lady.
who the hell's Warlow? I've already told her vampires killed her parents.
what's she want from me?
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.
Yeah, you sure did.
well, don't just stand there gawking, Bud. Grab her damn feet.
Yes, Sweetie.
sheriff Bellefleur, is it true that Barack Obama is actually behind the recent unsolved shootings and the kidnapping of a local vampire?
no. The President of the United States is not actually in Renard Parish shooting and kidnapping people.
we believe there is a hate group who are disguising themselves wearing Obama masks.
this hate group, they kidnapped a vampire, but they've also been linked to a double homicide in Monroe and a shooting outside Shreveport.
those victims were human, so what's the connection?
sorry, I-- I can't comment on that at this time. Excuse me.
sheriff. Sheriff!
Andy, we went back to that basement, picked up the scent of at least five or six people and something else, too.
pigs. - Pigs?
more specifically, pig shit.
tracked all over the place. Must have been on their shoes.
okay, well, thanks for the tip.
now I suggest y'all lie low until we bring them in.
Hey, listen, I saved your life. I'm in this.
that was before you turned into you.
in case you haven't noticed, this place is crawling with reporters.
so unless you want me to go on camera and tell them you turn into a dog and she turns into you, y'all better get outta here.
Andy, don't be an asshole. - Go home, Merlotte.
if he doesn't wanna help us, fuck him.
come here.
okay, what are we doing?
you ever been a fly on a wall?
you scream again, I will shoot. You understand?
keys.
Terry said he was gonna settle things with you-- - I said give me your keys now.
go on. Go on.
please, please. My kids.
look, you do exactly what I say, I'll let you get home to 'em.
I promise.
now who else is working?
uh, Sam is taking the day off.
Holly's babysitting.
Lafayette's supposed to be cooking, but he's always late.
all right, all right, you call him, you tell him not to come in.
Merlotte's is closed for the day.
okay. - Okay.
Oh, God. - Come on!
shit. I'm sorry.
lafayette, it's Arlene.
Yep, you're late again.
but guess what, Sam's shut-- shutting down for the day.
no, nothing's wrong. I think he's just taking care of that leak in the men's room finally.
well, you know what they say-- don't look a gift horse in the mouth, right?
but you have a good day.
Yeah, okay, I will.
Hoyt, wake up.
I feel so good and happy.
I never thought heaven would smell like this, but it sure is pretty.
Oh, Hoyt, you're high as a kite.
what did they give you?
here, piggy, piggy, piggy.
hungry pigs?
well, look who's awake.
we got two Obamas so far-- Junior and Joe Bob.
these guys are Bon Temps born and bred.
what else they got in common?
both got dumb-ass white-trash names starting with J, played football for BT High.
sheriff Dearborne arrested both of them.
Joe Bob 'cause folks said he's one of them boys torched that vampire house in Monroe.
we could never prove anything.
the American Vampire League was crawling up our ass, so Bud dragged him in, held him overnight, let him go.
what about Junior?
public drunkenness, all it says.
a town like this, everybody spends a night or two in the slammer.
I don't see much of a connection there.
whoever this Dragon is, it's somebody they're scared of.
I mean, we kicked the bejesus out of Joe Bob-- - Stackhouse!
I mean, uh, Joe Bob fell off his bunk real hard, and he still wouldn't turn on the Dragon.
if this Dragon's done anything to Hoyt,
I ain't never gonna forgive myself for a long, long time.
that boy wouldn't be wearing makeup in Fangtasia or joining hate groups or any of this shit if I hadn't have slept with Jess.
don't be too hard on yourself.
we all fall short somewhere.
you use your dick for a compass.
me, I'm just a bad cop. - Andy.
I'm the worst sheriff this town's ever had. Everybody knows it.
we assaulted a prisoner today.
now, Joe Bob's a son of a bitch, but it is my job to protect son of a bitches, too, and vampires and shifters, werechickens and whatever the fuck else is out there!
the world's going to hell in a hand bucket.
maybe I oughta do like Bud,
walk out of here, retire, cheat on my wife, square-dance.
holy...
long live the Dragon!
his boots. Look at his boots.
since you hung up your hat for good, it's time you put on your new dancing shoes.
thank you. They're beautiful.
bud's the Dragon.
bud's the Dragon.
bud's the goddamn Dragon.
sorry about this.
with your mind-reading and all, we couldn't risk you telling somebody on us.
Mr. Dearborne, I don't know what you're talking about.
the supes are trying to take over the whole world.
crafty suckers have been at it a long, long time.
I got a stack of unsolved cases dating back over 40 years
innocent people like your folks murdered by vamps and who knows what else.
somebody's gotta put an end to it.
how?
shooting good people like Sam Merlotte who've never done anything but help this town?
Merlotte ain't helping this town.
he's buying it.
bars, apartment buildings.
just a matter of time before he starts in on churches and schools.
then he can convert all the innocent children to his perverted shifter ways.
world War IV ain't gonna be fought over land or oil in no foreign country, it's gonna be fought right here for our humanity.
excuse me, who are you?
sweetie Des Arts. Nice to meet you, freak.
you don't look like a Sweetie.
bud, maybe Sookie'd like some of that ginger ale now.
I-- I don't think she's part of the conspiracy.
I known her her whole life.
well, then, you know better than I do.
she sure as shit ain't human.
she's a mind-reader with electric fingers and a fetish for fangers!
if that ain't a supe, I don't know what the hell is.
you can't let your emotions cloud your vision, baby.
they may look like us and talk like us, but they are not like us.
what about Hoyt? He's about as human as they come.
we gave him a chance to be a hero for humanity and he pussied out.
he loves mutants so much, he might as well die with them.
bud, you were the sheriff of this town.
you're supposed to protect people.
and that's what I'm doing-- protecting people.
the law don't protect people. - You tell her, Bud.
the law gives monsters equal rights and sends patriots like my cousin Joe Bob to jail for sticking up for his own kind.
all the law ever gave me was cancer in my ass - and a sexless marriage. - That's right, baby.
when the supernatural war's over and the smoke clears, we're gonna write us a new law, one that makes sense for humans.
supes will be aborted or shot on sight, and all of humanity'll know the sacrifices that we made in the name of America.
there are gonna be flags with our faces on 'em.
that's right.
what happened to you?
something awful must've happened to you to fill you with so much crazy hate.
my husband left me for that shifter bitch liked to turn herself into a damn raccoon.
what's that supposed to do for my self-esteem?
you get outta my head, you freak show!
give her the fuckin' ginger ale already or I'll do it my damn self.
come on, now. It's just got some OxyContin left over from my colon surgery in it.
bud, you don't wanna do this.
that woman is out of her mind. - Watch your mouth.
this woman is the Dragon of Renard Parish, the Square-Dancing Champion of Louisiana, and the love of my life.
open up.
bust it.
clear! - Clear.
motherfucker!
where the hell are you, Bud? Where are you?
it's Bud's wife, Lynn.
she was my sixth grade teacher.
used to bake me cookies and let me take naps on her lap.
is there a point to this, Stackhouse?
her family owned a pig farm out on the way to Kickapoo.
pig shit.
where the fuck are you? - I'm watching you.
put your weapon down and come in with your hands in the air.
don't do it, Terr.
Terry, he's gonna kill you! Run!
those kids need their mother. Don't you make me shoot her.
I trusted you.
I kept our secret even when it was eating a hole through me.
after everything we've been through, how could you do this?
she's my wife. - Stop. Stop right there.
now, I have a family, too.
Maggie's pregnant and I promised her I'd come home.
I don't wanna do this shit. You know I don't.
but there's no other way to end it.
a fair fight. Let the best man win.
you're stronger than I am.
you're a better soldier, a better man.
but it's you or me. That's what it's come down to.
and it ain't gonna be me. Now get on your knees.
no.
God damn it, Bellefleur, get on your knees.
get outta here.
I'm-- I'm sorry.
God damn it!
don't move, motherfucker, or I will blow your fucking brains out.
must be peaceful to be so sure of something.
no room for doubt or remorse.
faith isn't magic. Anyone can do it.
mm, but it requires surrendering.
I've never been a big fan of that.
still such a fucking Viking, even after all these years.
always.
but you-- you've changed.
you're not the power-hungry bitch I used to love.
all I cared about was rising up the ranks of the Authority and making my mark, sitting in Roman's chair someday.
I had no idea what true power was.
how-- how did you find God?
she snuck me in here during the day whilst Roman was in ground.
she let me taste the blood.
and it blew my fucking mind, Eric.
my ambitions seemed trivial, and everything I had once cared about seemed insignificant in the face of such divinity.
and I felt this overwhelming sense of purpose and belonging.
well, I wish it were that simple for me.
it can be.
no. - It can be.
believing in something other than yourself doesn't make you weak, Eric.
even the tallest tree knows its existence depends on the soil beneath its roots and the sun and the rain upon its branches.
that's what Lilith is to us.
I don't wanna fight you.
I want to believe.
will you help me?
Yes.
Yeah.
thousands of years, Salome has meant nothing but a naked girl with a man's head in her lap.
now I will be linked to Lilith forever.
that will be my true legacy.
so few have the chance to shape history.
not once, but twice.
it's not an accident.
I've been chosen and so have you.
Lilith has chosen you as my Adam.
we will birth a new world together.
what if I don't want to be chosen?
her blood is inside you.
let it be your guide.
why don't we just shoot 'em?
cause we're making a political statement, ass-for-brains.
the world's gone to the pigs 'cause of the supes, so we're feeding the supes to the pigs.
get it?
this is going on the website, baby, so put on your mask.
right.
God bless America!
bring in the pigs!
here, piggy, piggy, piggy.
toss her in there. Give those porkies something to chew on.
I got you. - Jesus, help me! Keep it away from me!
stay outta my pig, dirty shifter!
stay close. Keep your eye on the perimeter.
sheriff's Department! Freeze!
get down on your fuckin' knees!
drop the weapon, Bud. It's over.
humans rule!
Oh, my God.
the hell are you doing here?
Hoyt. Buddy!
that's for shooting me.
that's for my boyfriend.
and this is for my daughter, you human trash!
you okay?
Hi. - Hi.
were you a pig or did I dream that?
come on, Hoyt.
come on, buddy. It's J. I'm right here, man.
stay with me, man.
stay with me, bubba.
stay with me, man.
I think she hit an artery.
if you're not gonna shoot me, I need to get to a hospital.
do it, Terry. Shoot him.
she's a fighter. That's good.
if you care about something, you gotta fight for it.
I'm not just fighting for my life. - Don't listen to him, Terry.
he is messing with your head. He would've shot you on your knees.
Maggie's due in December.
it's a Christmas baby, a little boy like Mikey.
shut up! - Do it.
you shoot him in the head right now for your family.
that's how this whole thing got started, remember?
you taking orders.
dead check her. Do it.
shoot him. Shoot him, Terry.
you gotta do what your conscience tells you this time.
do what's right.
do What is right.
blood has been paid with blood.
take what is yours, Ifrit.
can I get some Tru Blood, please?
where the fuck's my Tru Blood?
excuse me.
good, now I've got your attention.
number one:
there's no feeding on humans in Fangtasia.
number fuckin' two:
get out of my maker's throne before I stake you all over it.
monarchs have lifted the ban on public feeding.
and Northman is history.
the Authority has named me the new Sheriff of Area 5.
everybody, grab a human. Drinks are on me!
is Hoyt gonna be okay?
he had a pulse, but it was real weak.
Jason'll call us from the hospital if there's any news.
what about you? You sure you don't want to at least go get checked out?
I'll be fine as soon as I wash the pig out of my hair.
all right, get in. I'll drive you home.
Thanks.
listen, I just wanted to say-- - It's all good.
you saved my life. I saved yours back.
no, I was gonna say you're not the worst sheriff this town ever had.
bud Dearborne had you beat by a mile.
Thanks, Sam.
night.
let's go get Emma.
Yeah.
I first started collecting werewolves in Scandinavia almost 2, 000 years ago.
my first was a lovely werebitch named Gisla.
whitest pelt, greenest eyes, loyal like you wouldn't believe, even before I gave her my blood.
but after
she'd rip apart anything that looked at me sideways.
you think dogs are good pets, wait till you try a werewolf on V.
I've never had a pet.
my father was allergic to everything except God.
you forget that bloodbag.
stick with me, darlin'.
I'll give you the world.
I hear a celebration is in order.
we have a new Packmaster.
to J. D. Packmaster of Shreveport.
Oh, okay. All right, all right.
what's your name, werebitch?
and who is that adorable little puppy?
so cute.
name's Martha. This is my granddaughter.
come, Martha.
join your pack.
I chose my pack, and I swore I'd die for it, but I will never drink from you, fanger.
the smarter the creature, the more discipline it needs.
No! You let go of her.
you let her go! - For you, my darlin'.
Emma! - Your first pet.
J. D. please. Not my grandbaby.
stop him, please.
Mr. Edgington...
see, Emma, she's a member of this pack, so I can't let you do that.
did you think my blood was free?
you silly, silly dog.
shall we?
Oh, Russell, she's adorable.
No!
dad.
beer in the fridge.
grab me one while you're in there.
how much you got on this?
four, five.
so your whole disability check. Nice.
it's a long drive to come out here and give me another lecture.
it's not why I came.
I lost Packmaster.
I've been abjured.
so you're a lone wolf now.
just like your old man.
I'm nothing like you.
sure, you're not.
two more explosions at Tru Blood factories in Japan and Kuwait.
steve Newlin of the American Vampire League has called the attacks "a vicious act of terrorism" against all God-fearing, - peace-loving vampire citizens of the world. - Oh, bollocks.
I'm sorry, I don't know you. - Oh, Claudija.
well, it's nice to meet you, but what are y'all doing in my living room in the middle of the night?
we brought you some soup, Sookie.
move over.
don't believe a word of it. Vampires are behind it all.
Why?
they're taking over the world.
us together again on the same side.
that's what Godric would have wanted.
you're right.
where are you taking me?
home.
Eric, no.
we gotta move fast. She won't be out long.
Where's Bill? - We can't wait for him.
you had me worried there for a minute.
ready to get the hell outta here?
access granted.
you fuckin' traitor.
I'm doing this for you.
you've been chosen by Lilith.
this is what God wants.
as the human world waits with bated breath, the makers of Tru Blood promise to rebuild all five of their destroyed plants.
but concerns remain that it may not come soon enough.
across America, police are reporting a 50% spike in vampire attacks, a number sure to increase as reserves of Tru Blood continue to dwindle.
meanwhile, earlier today, AVL spokesperson Reverend Steve Newlin had this to say.
we at the AVL are working closely with our friends at Homeland Security to find the terrorists who cut off our food supply.
but people should not have any fear of leaving their house at night.
please go about your business.
vampires are just as committed...
Oh, shut up. - To keeping the peace as humans are.
what are you doing outside? Come in. You know it ain't safe.
what's goin' on?
I'm here about the body.
what body? - Yours.
you're gonna have to do better than that.
Oh, I always liked you, Sookie. But I had no idea.
fuck.
finally we get to have a little fun around here.
Molly, we give you this last chance to accept the word of Lilith.
even if I did, you'd kill me anyway.
unfortunately, we must.
you compromised our security.
the chancellors have agreed on the true death for you.
in that case, allow me to say... fuck all of you.
you are destroying the world based on a book that is thousands of years old.
you call that evolved?
that's the opposite of evolved.
Oh, put the poor girl out of her misery.
she was a good employee.
she developed the perfect staking device.
almost. It chafes your nipples.
we can convert you.
it's just that none of us think you're worth the trouble.
may Lilith bless you.
Yes!
Oh, my fucking God. I've never actually seen a vampire get staked before.
that... that was awesome.
Reverend Newlin, please.
let us bless the blood.
okay.
all this talk of killing has made me positively ravenous.
who wants to go out and eat?
I could eat.
Reverend Newlin has an important TV appearance tomorrow.
he needs to prepare.
well, I thought the Book of fuckin' Lilith wanted us to go out and hunt.
or is there some chapter where we're supposed to be sittin' around memorizing index cards?
let him have some fun.
everyone's become such a sourpuss lately.
excellent.
come on.
don't worry about her.
we'll bring her back a doggie bag.
what are you in the mood for?
I was thinkin' Greek.
good luck with Northman.
mama went and sold half her doll collection to clear some space for your room.
bought you a new mattress, too.
california King.
I don't approve of the state, but it's good for a boy your size.
I don't want my old room back.
well, there is no way I'm gonna let you move back into that house.
not with all them vampires on the loose.
especially you-know-who.
she ain't coming after me.
had to practically stand over your hospital bed to keep that Cheeto-headed tramp from giving you her blood.
thanks for that.
it's all over now.
God's given me a second chance at life.
and I ain't gonna waste it.
what you got in mind?
a couple guys from Parish Services took a job on a drilling crew and they asked me to come along.
where is this job?
Alaska. - Oil drillin'?
it's better than anything I could get here.
near to 30 years in this town and what do I got to show for ithu, h?
well, Hoyt. You're still recoverin'.
Oh, Mama, what do you want?
an invalid, or a son who made something of himself?
that's what I thought.
one hundred, two, three... four, five, six.
well, fuck me. He can count past five.
Where's the rest?
there's nothing legal left for vampires.
and humans aren't exactly flockin' these days.
600 bucks in a night?
how are you paying your employees?
she not. - Look...
the Shield and Stake in Natchitoches has these little repurposed two-way peep show booths.
you put in a twenty and a little door opens up.
and the human sticks in his wrist or leg or whatever appendage, and his vampire friend has 30 seconds to suck.
it earns over two grand an hour.
thanks for the suggestion, but we prefer to do things the old-fashioned way.
Yeah, you and Blockbuster Video.
you know, protection from your sheriff doesn't come free.
and given the current climate, prices might be going up.
here's your cut.
Oh, I do have one directive from on high.
we have a procreation mandate to bump up the population by the end of the year.
30 new baby vamps in Area 5.
and if we don't?
then, in the name of the Authority, I take possession of your assets.
including your progeny.
Ugh. Well, that's a stroke of luck.
good thing you didn't order pizza.
you're not gonna eat that?
I kinda lost my appetite.
and isn't that evidence or something?
I hate to say it, but these days one less vampire ain't gonna cause much of a fuss.
maybe we saved ourselves a couple human lives.
I wonder who turned him?
he couldn't have been vampire for more than a day or two.
hell if I know.
funny thing is, this is the exact kinda crime scene Mike woulda loved.
I know. Our town needed a guy like him.
man loved his job.
he wanted to suck on my toes.
he kept autopsy photos on his computer same place he kept his porn.
EW, no. - Yep.
suddenly, I don't feel so bad.
your sister and I can only keep you alive for so long.
others wanted you executed already.
the true death will come very soon if you do not accept Lilith, as it will for all nonbelievers.
so let it come.
what does it matter to you?
you saved my life.
and in return, we will save your soul.
no.
I refuse.
Shh. I'll do it with you.
no. - Yes.
no.
we will meet her together.
take it in.
she is in you.
she's here.
give yourself to her.
no. - I tried.
I tried to save her.
my children. - Father.
how have you come? - My blood is in you.
I'm with you always.
no, you left me centuries ago.
the blood of Lilith is within me now.
Lilith is a godless god.
she will lead you and all around you to destruction.
how can you say that?
after all the years that you and I and Eric hunted and killed together?
how can you tell me it's wrong?
because I have done what you've failed to do.
I've evolved.
please save her, Father.
she is lost. - No, no.
I am sworn to Lilith.
please... Please, spare him, Lilith!
fight her!
you must fight her!
it's not I who must fight her.
No! - Father!
praise Lilith.
imagine a time when we will own not only the night, but the day as well.
how can we do that?
we can walk in the sun.
there's a way. And it is tantalizingly close to us.
please... take me with you.
I thought you'd never ask.
God damn it. Vampers.
come on. Let's get the hell outta here.
just leave it.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
you'd take a vampire over your own kind?
you ain't my kind.
whatever, dude.
you stop me, there'd be another guy to take that fanger down.
no, there won't. On the floor.
not you. The gun, dumbfuck.
you, too.
you hungry, Jess?
you have no idea.
well, I'm all out of Tru Blood.
but I got two new specials on the menu.
what the fuck, man? We weren't gonna shoot her.
six wooden bullets say you were.
know what? I'll pass.
looking kinda stringy.
I'm here to see someone anyhow.
you take any table you'd like.
okay?
so we can go here, right?
get the fuck out.
take your fries to go.
what was that about?
just keepin' the peace under my roof, Jason.
is there a vampire in here?
what are you doing here without your guards? - What guards?
bill stopped payin' them, so they split.
well, that sucks.
not really for them.
they were startin' to look kinda tasty.
what are you doing here?
um... just meeting someone.
Yeah, me, too.
look at all this.
like I'd ever turn any of them.
fine, then. I'll make two.
I always wanted kids.
but we have to. - No.
we procreate because we want to.
not because some dickhead dipped in afterbirth told us to.
what? You'd let Elijah take everything?
the money? The bar? Me?
he can have the fucking bar.
what's it worth at this point?
you and me, we live in the wind, just like I did with Eric.
we don't need this place. It's four walls and plaster.
that's all.
Alaska?
what the hell, Bubba?
it's only 4, 000 miles away.
I'll be there next week.
gimme one good reason why I shouldn't go.
this is your home.
my home is where my mama smothers me and my girl left me for my best friend and a bunch of Barack Obamas nearly got me killed.
but other than that?
yeah... Hoyt, who's to say Alaska's gonna be any better?
that's an awfully long way, man.
my God. You know, I want this.
it's done.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
y'all can't even be happy for me.
I'm sorry, man. I... I can't be happy to see you go.
well, to hell with it, then.
I'll tell you what I need from you.
for my going-away present, I want you to glamour me.
make me forget about you.
Hoyt... - I want you gone. Out of my head.
I wanna lay down, go to sleep, close my eyes and not dream about you ever again.
just take a deep breath and really consider for a sec what you're askin'.
is this really what you want?
I want him gone, too.
jeez. Come on, now.
it's the last thing I'll ever ask of you.
please take this hurt away from me so that I can go on havin' my life.
please.
look at me.
God damn it, Jessica. I'm not messin' around.
now, look at me.
make this go away.
Hoyt Fortenberry... you are... a good, good man...
with the biggest heart I've ever known.
you were my first love.
I'll never forget you.
you were Jason's best friend. He won't forget you, either.
we're gonna miss you so, so much.
but you are not going to miss us.
you are gonna go to Alaska and... you're gonna start a brand-new life.
you're gonna make a whole lot of new friends.
you'll forget about Jason.
forget he ever existed.
do you understand? - Yeah.
and you're gonna make some girl the luckiest, happiest girl in the world.
and she... she's going to be your first love.
not me.
I am... fading away... and going... going till I vanish from your mind.
when I tell you, I want you to close your eyes and count to 10.
when you open them... we'll be gone.
now you're gonna have yourself a burger and a beer and not a care in the world.
okay? - Okay.
all right, go ahead.
one. Two. Three.
four. - I love you, Bubba.
five.
six.
seven.
goodbye, Hoyt.
can I get a waitress?
mind if I bring the blow-up bed?
your couch is kind of its own life-form.
my casa is your casa.
you know, in a funny way, it's like Hoyt's forgiven you.
he wanted to let it go, he just couldn't do it himself.
somehow I don't feel too forgiven.
I was hoping in the hospital maybe he'd have a change of heart.
we'd catch the Dragon, me and Hoyt are good again, and somewhere in Bud Dearborn's old files, we find out who killed Mom and Daddy.
is that all you got from his house?
well, it was the only box marked "Vampire Attacks?."
if Bud was on to something, it'd be in there.
we can go through it again at your place.
no. Just admit it, Sook. There ain't nothing in there.
the universe don't work that easy.
God don't just throw Bud's files in your lap and say,"Here it is."
but Gran told me,"Look under the bed."
well, was there anything else under the bed?
photos, report cards... a bunch of other crap.
a bunch of other... Oh, jeez. You'd make one hell of a cop.
knock yourself out.
I've already been through it a hundred times.
okay, she said,"Look in the box under the bed. " That's exactly what she said, right?
in the box.
actually, she didn't say anything about the box. Just under the bed.
who's the smart one now?
what the...
what magazine did you say you were from?
"dog Monthly. " We're hopin' to get the Reverend Steve Newlin on the cover with this new puppy we've heard he's got.
we could even send a photographer there, wherever he is.
the reverend is very busy. We can't accommodate everyone.
well, could you at least confirm he's got a dog?
thank you for calling AVL.
I fucking hate humans.
what happened?
no local TV will do a story on Emma.
and Caddo Parish's sheriff fucking banned me from their office.
why would he do that?
because I'm the crazy bitch saying that Steve Newlin...
kidnapped your daughter. Right. - ... kidnapped my daughter.
everybody wants credible evidence.
I am gonna tell them everything.
werewolves, shifters, Russell Edgington... - That might get you locked up.
the Shreveport pack has closed ranks.
and your vampire friends? They are no help.
so what the fuck else can we do?
I wanna show you something, but you gotta control yourself.
promise?
tonight, a TBBN Vampire Crisis exclusive.
live from New Orleans, Louisiana, a summit featuring both sides of the debate.
mortal rights advocate Congressman David Finch squares off against American Vampire League spokesman Reverend Steve Newlin.
tonight at 8: 00 pm Eastern, only on TBBN.
Oh, fuck.
he's in this state.
we have to go.
new Orleans is five hours away.
we will never make it.
unless I got credit card miles.
Hey, imagine if someone could read all these.
he wrote a bunch of 'em, too.
well, I ran it by the entire department and everyone agrees.
either you two are a couple of jokesters sent by Louisiana Tech...
don't laugh, it's happened.
or you're the victims of a not particularly sophisticated hoax.
hoax? Why would anyone plant a hoax under my gran's bed?
I can't speak to that, but whoever it is is long dead because this vellum is at least 200 years old.
maybe more. - What does it say?
I don't think it says anything.
you've got glyphs on a page arranged in groups of four or five so, at first glance, it looks like words.
but here's the problem.
none of these characters repeat.
every alphabet known to man has a defined set of characters, not 300 different ones.
this is just a set of hundreds of unique squiggles.
if it doesn't mean anything, why bother writing it down?
why does my ex-wife name her toes?
maybe as a joke.
maybe 'cause she's nuts.
I don't get into the why of it.
all I can tell you is this is not in any language.
at least not in any human one.
Hey, handsome. - Hi there.
ready to split? - Actually, no.
I got a little thank you for you for taking me home these last three nights in a row.
I don't say this to many men, but I love you.
but, baby, don't get used to it.
cause once this vampire situation is over, folk gonna be back or we gonna be dead.
one or the other.
either way, you gets no more of this.
we will savor every bite.
save room for dessert.
I ain't gonna tell y'all what it is, but best believe it's gonna be flamin'.
Yes, it is!
see, you can live large when you've got the town to yourself at night.
also, I got the sheriff with me in case anyone wants to cause any trouble.
thought you had the sheriff with ya 'cause you took a shine to him.
maybe.
ms. Hamby, your maker sent for you. Please come with us.
bullshit. Get the hell outta my house.
bill? What's goin' on?
are you in some kind of trouble?
no, but you will be if you don't do as I say.
as your maker, I command you to go along with my security team.
w-w-wait, could you at least... Crap.
don't touch me.
the truth, former Reverend Newlin, is that you don't know who bombed those Tru Blood factories and it's presumptuous to say that it was a terrorist attack brought on by humans.
Suzanne, I sense a conspiracy theory coming on in three, two...
I believe that there is a faction of the vampire population that wishes to do away with the pretense and go back to the old days of murder and bloodshed.
next thing you'll be saying is that we have a shadow government in an underground complex somewhere.
you might. - We do not.
and the numbers back me up.
humans do far more killing than vampires do.
not for long.
with no Tru Blood, you must be starving, Reverend.
well, we've all had to make sacrifices.
yet you are positively glowing.
when's the last time you ate?
actually, I do keep a reserve of Tru Blood for emergencies, as do most vampires.
we're rationing, but we make do.
frankly, I'm deeply offended by these sort of insinuations from someone that I once considered a friend.
look, Emma. That's your daddy on TV.
...long hours together, just man to man.
I bet you, if you probed hard enough, you'd find out that we're on the same team on a lot of these issues.
isn't he handsome?
representative Finch, what is your response to that?
are you on the same team?
I think he's dashing.
how is he doing? - Splendid.
Finch is coming off nuttier than a fruitcake.
and what about our prisoner?
he's our prisoner no longer.
I am pleased to report that our efforts with Mr. Northman have finally borne fruit.
I humbly beg your forgiveness.
I refused to recognize what was clear to all of us.
Lilith came to me.
and she destroyed my maker, whom I was worshipping as a false god.
we are the children of Lilith.
and it is her whom we must obey.
and to you... I give thanks for your mercy.
and I forgive you for your sins against my family.
we are made again.
we are brothers now in the eyes of Lilith.
and as we are one in her blood, we must lay down our swords against one another.
if Lilith wills it, so be it.
even though... you're gettin' the better end of the deal.
