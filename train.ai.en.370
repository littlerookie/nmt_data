gad lives there like a lion, tearing at arm or head.
gad says he came to appreciate woz the prankster and his fun-loving nature.
gad will be attacked by a band of raiders, but he will attack them at their heels.
Gad: "this is macworld.
gadadhar had never seen anything like this at kamarpukur among the simple and pious villagers.
gadaffi is a sad example of the maxim about absolute power corrupting absolutely.
gadaffi picked up victims at his former alma mater, tripoli university, where he gave lectures and then led the young women to a nearby room whose only furniture was a double bed.
gadaffi still retains some support in western libya and from important tribes.
gadaffi's hero and father figure was egypt's charismatic gamal abdel nasser.
gadamer attributes to him the differentiation of understanding and misunderstanding, in which the interpreter is seen to begin the process within his or her own misunderstandings.
gadamer has condensed his modern philosophical hermeneutics into three main principles-historical interpretation, fusion of horizons and effected history, which helped to provide a new scope for researching translator's autonomy in translation activities.
gadamer is willing to sacrifice because of his belief in the inescapability of preconception.
gadamer reaveled the subject participating in the truth actively from relations among truth, history and language.
gadamer's theory of playing is based on ontology, and he attempts to point out the inadequacy understanding of subjective and objective. Thinking the inadequacy can supple by the understanding experience of artwork.

gaddafi and assad are the same kind of people as saddam hussein.
gaddafi and his fifth son muta maxim 20 militants were arrested by the libyan authorities to govern, and then died of his wounds.
gaddafi and his wife, two children and a daughter on august 29 had fled to algeria.
gaddafi appears as long-lost appearance on national television when the rebels are based in benghazi before the "freedom square" on the party wall to the tv people began throwing shoes and shout "dictator immediately get out" slogan.
gaddafi boosted his own forces by attracting volunteers ready to fight to hold libya together, a sentiment reinforced when the rebels adopted the flag used by king idris al-sanousi, libya's former monarch, whom gaddafi overthrew in his 1969 coup.
gaddafi certainly hope to keep the position, or his son take over his, in order to ensure a future of peace.

gaddafi did not see it as a threat.
