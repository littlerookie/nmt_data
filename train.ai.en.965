thank you so much for coming. It was really nice to meet you.
thank you so much, Suzanne.
I've been a big fan of your show for a long time.
you know, my daddy used to come on the show.
is she here? - I don't see her.
I don't smell her.
shit, he didn't even bring her.
he probably left her somewhere.
what are you doing?
well, if he's like most of us, his phone's full of pictures of his dog.
did you see the look on Finch's face? Priceless.
I don't know where you and Russell went to eat last night, but next time, you have got to take me.
I think we pretty much shut that place down.
you rascal.
you want me to wait outside?
Nope. Just need my bag.
we'll take comments on the debate after a break, right here on TBBN.
holy smokes. What are you doing?
that's Hoyt. I gotta talk to him.
Jason, you gotta let him go.
just sit tight. I won't be but a minute.
so, here's my license and registration.
any relation to Sookie?
well, yeah.
Yeah, there's a couple of us.
you going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm movin'.
I got a job in Alaska.
the Last Frontier.
the Last Frontier.
do you remember when we...
I mean when kids, they used to pretend to go up in space, start their own planets and shit?
you used to do that, too?
listen, don't go, Bubba.
I'm beggin' you.
this is your home, man.
and people love you here.
did my mama put you up to this?
you tell her she has email, cell phone, everything she needs.
she's gonna be okay.
is there anything else?
you drive safe.
thank you, Officer.
okay, somebody better start talking or I am going to go apeshit.
you are safe and that's all that matters.
I tried to keep you out of it, but it's just too dangerous in Bon Temps.
in here, you'll have your own quarters, have full protection during the day and all your needs attended to at night.
is this 'cause of the Tru Blood bombings?
are we at the AVL?
and finally, this is the sanctum of the Vampire Authority.
this chamber dates back to Byzantium.
and as our seat of power has moved over the centuries, so too has each brick and each column.
2, 000 years of our history right here within these four walls.
staggering to consider, don't you think?
Yeah.
so how'd you get put in charge?
well, it's not only me.
but it is I and several others whom you might say were chosen.
what, you mean... like by God?
suppose we were.
nine million species on this earth and here we are at the pinnacle of the food chain.
were we not chosen by nature or fate or by some great deity?
we have one of these at our home.
it sits unused on a shelf because I thought I knew better.
but I read it again with an open mind, and my world is full of wonder and mystery again.
that's feeling a lot like the Bible study my parents made me do.
well, it's not that different.
they just had the wrong book.
I know it's gonna take time.
it's a lot to process all at once.
but soon, you'll see that you and I and even Eric were meant to lead our kind into the coming age.
wait, what... what coming age?
I'm getting ahead of myself.
just consider the words on their own without prejudice.
you might be surprised.
enough book talk.
you wanna see your room?
sure. Lead the way.
Oh, my God. Thank you... thank you for coming. I didn't know who else to call.
you've got two minutes.
it's Ginger.
I think I killed her. - Oh, Christ.
didn't your maker teach you? - She doesn't know.
she said she wasn't making anyone and neither could I.
please, you gotta help me.
I don't know nothin' about birthin' no baby vampires.
ice your clam. Lemme take a look.
she's got a pulse. - Is she breathing?
she's holding her breath.
you have got to be kidding me.
we're not running.
no one fucks with us in our house.
Hey, hey, Chels. How'd I do tonight?
we were all very impressed.
Whoo. Live to fight another day.
here's your mail, Reverend.
and, um, about your pet. She's, um...
Oh, no. Is she all right? - She's fine. She just...
Lemme go get her.
I put her in one of your shirts.
I hope that's okay. - Emma!
you know that Daddy doesn't like it when you're human.
do you want Nigel to eat you?
do you? - I want my mommy.
well, your mommy doesn't want you, punk.
Emma, get back here!
Emma! Bad puppy!
I've ordered translations of the Book of Lilith in 70 languages.
every new vampire should be required to learn it.
well, the old vampires should as well.
we want everyone to accept Lilith, don't we?
are we seriously sitting here discussing education reform?
are we vampires or schoolmarms?
her word is sacred.
how do you propose we seize our rightful place in the hierarchy of beings when we're helpless as hamsters for 12 hours out of the day?
that is the way we were created.
but it's not how we have to remain.
the legends are true.
the blood of the fae allows us to daywalk.
Compton, Northman, you've both drunk from the same faerie I have.
you know it lasts a few minutes at most before you fry.
the Wright Brothers' first flight lasted 12 seconds.
did they turn to each other and say,"12 seconds is pretty good."
let's give up and try something else"?
we harness the blood.
we study it. We capture another faerie, even, and breed them.
if the Japanese can synthesize human blood, why can't we do the same thing with faerie blood?
because we are of the night.
the sun is forbidden to us.
fairies are an abomination.
their blood is like sucking on heaven.
you know what I wish?
I wish that I had just one drop of faerie blood to stuff in your piehole.
I saved you, Russell.
I can put you back in the ground.
Oh, please.
give me an excuse to kill the both of you.
or, hell, why not all of you?
I am... 3, 000 years old.
I am stronger than all of you combined.
how long did you think I would be your lapdog?
I offered you the opportunity to share in the greatest advancement in the history of our race, and the small-mindedness of your religion has literally kept you in the dark!
you can have your Lilith.
I will not be constrained by your god or anyone else's.
I will have the sun!
the characters are from our language, but these aren't words.
they're just fragments.
"Ocha tucan. " None of these are words on their own.
it's like reading alphabet soup.
well, maybe it's a code. Do fairies write in code?
could be in the old language.
it could. This is probably older than we are.
we're only 130.
perhaps we should ask someone less young than us.
wait, you mean there are fairies here who are older than 130?
Oh, God, yes.
I mean, how do you think we got so good at dancing?
that's all we do now that we're locked down at night.
she's 500 but she only admits to being 300.
like you really couldn't tell. She's halfway to being an Elder.
Sookie, Jason, this is Maurella.
mm, yes. I've heard of you.
this is the document.
we thought you might know more.
Oh, my. Where did you get this?
underneath the floorboards in my gran's house.
do you know what it is?
it's a contract. Blood on vellum.
like, human blood?
no, faerie.
the blood of the signee was used as ink on the most sacred pacts.
can you read it? - Not yet.
our ancestors were even more secretive than we are today.
however...
it's a lost art.
5th of August, 1702.
I, John William Stackhouse, in reference to our binding agreement on this said date, do grant Mr. M. Warlow my first... fae-bearing female heir.
Warlow. He's the one who...
who was the first female faerie in our family after 1702?
actually, there haven't been any.
until Sookie.
the true death will come very soon if you do not accept Lilith.
Lilith is a godless god.
she will lead you and all around you to destruction.
Alaska? -- I'll be there next week.
I want you to glamour me. Make me forget about you.
I want him gone, too. -- Goodbye, Hoyt.
tonight, live from New Orleans, Louisiana, Reverend Steve Newlin.
he's in the state. We have to go.
he probably left for somewhere.
you know that Daddy doesn't like it when you're human.
so what, then? You let Elijah take everything from you?
we live in the wind just like I did with Eric.
we're not running.
I lost Packmaster. I've been abjured.
you're a lone wolf now, just like your old man.
Lilith came to me and she destroyed my maker whom I was worshipping as a false god.
we are the children of Lilith.
you'll see that you and I were meant to lead our kind into the coming age.
what coming age?
the blood of the faerie allows us to daywalk.
we are of the night.
I can put you back in the ground.
you can have your Lilith.
I will have the sun!
where did you get this?
underneath the floorboards in my gran's house.
it's a contract . "I, John William Stackhouse grant Mr. M. Warlow my first fae-bearing female heir."
only one can lead us.
I choose you.
drink the blood.
drink it all.
no.
Lilith is a godless god.
she will lead you and all around you to destruction.
if you kill and kill, there will be nothing left, not even you.
No! -- Father!
general Cavanaugh is coming.
Nora? -- Yes?
we've received word that General Cavanaugh will be paying us a visit.
sorry. -- Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.
something's different. You've changed.
are you having doubts? -- No. No, of course not.
I'm worried about Russell.
his recklessness could destroy everything we've worked for.
Russell's inconsequential.
he's nothing.
this is all part of Lilith's plan.
Yes, of course.
we started this together, you and I.
and now everything we've dreamed of is coming to pass.
the world will run with blood. -- Yes.
and we'll be there to drink it down.
and in the darkness we shall rejoice.
I'll let the others know. -- Yeah. Go.
Hey, Bill. I was wondering if I could use your phone.
mine doesn't work down here. -- For what purpose?
I've got to warn Jason.
when you were gone, I had to stop Steve Newlin from attacking him twice.
and now that Russell and him are on the loose,
I'm really afraid he's gonna do it again.
so can I use it? -- I'm sorry, but no.
no?
but Jason is out there. He's a sitting duck.
Sookie, too.
Jessica, it has taken me a long while to come to terms with the fact that part of accepting the word of Lilith into my heart has been distancing myself from the trivial matters of humans.
it used to drive me crazy worrying about their feelings and their mortality and their weakness until I found a better way... Lilith's way.
and Jason and Sookie and the inhabitants of Bon Temps are no longer our concern.
they are food and nothing more.
you can't mean that.
you will see in time.
now, I'm sorry, but I have other matters that I have to attend to.
but what if I made him a vampire?
you want to be a maker?
I was... I was reading the Book of Lilith and it says that the greatest gift you can give a human is to make them a vampire.
that is true.
well, that makes sense to me because I love Jason, but it never seems to work out with him.
and I was thinking that's probably because he's a human and I'm a vampire.
but if I made him a vampire, then we can be together.
you know, blessed by Lilith.
do you think I'm an idiot?
what?
are you really gonna stand there and try and manipulate me with your foolish lies?
I'm not. -- Yes.
please, can you send in Gondry and Lambert?
what are you doing?
I'm taking you up on your generous offer.
if you want to make Jason Stackhouse into a vampire, then by all means, please do so.
no, Bill, I wasn't trying to manipulate you.
no, no, no. You're right.
in the time to come, it may be important for me to bolster the Compton bloodline.
so why not start right now?
as you rightly said, as chancellor, it would be hypocritical of me to demand that vampires become makers without requiring the same thing of you.
wait, Bill. -- Gondry.
this is my progeny Jessica.
I want you to take her to Bon Temps where she is gonna sire a young man named Jason Stackhouse.
take the helicopter. I want this thing done properly.
no, I don't need to, Bill. -- Don't let her out of your sight.
forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me.
what are we going to do?
I'll get us out of here.
you gonna be okay?
kinda strange to find out you were sold to a vampire 300 years ago.
Hey, that scroll thing is bullshit.
I don't care what it says, ain't nobody selling you.
not on my watch.
I think he came for me.
what are you talking about? -- Except he wasn't a vampire.
he was this weird air shape.
he said, "You are mine."
well, that is... really fucking creepy.
Maurella, she said talking to this Elder person, that could give us some answers.
she said it's worth a shot.
Oh, Sook. Come here.
I've got to go.
Andy's got us doing triple shifts with all these vamp attacks.
I'll come back tomorrow and check up on you.
you stay here where it's nice and safe.
okay.
I just need your help to get me out of here.
Jason, promise me you'll be careful.
never gonna get used to that.
we'll be standing by right here, sir.
general Cavanaugh. What a surprise.
so nice to see you again.
cut the crap, Chancellor. Where's Roman?
unfortunately, the Guardian is unavailable at this time.
who the fuck are you?
general, this is Chancellor Compton.
he's new.
well, there's a shit-storm out there and Roman's been ducking my calls.
now I demand to know what's going on.
well, you're not in a position to be making demands.
Oh, I see. And who the fuck are you?
general Cavanaugh, we deeply regret that Roman's not here, but can we do anything to help you?
we know you bombed the Tru Blood factories.
that is absurd. Those factories were bombed by terrorists.
don't bullshit a bullshitter, Rosalyn.
the US government and this Authority have an arrangement.
the arrangement is called mainstreaming.
it means you don't fuck with us, we don't fuck with you.
now, I've been working with Roman to protect this Authority for 20 years.
but this time you've gone too far.
there are high-level talks at the Pentagon right now about how to eradicate vampires from the face of the planet.
so I need to speak with Roman.
Roman is no longer with us.
how?
he couldn't get with the program, so he had to go.
this is a Sanguinist regime now.
Lilith has guided us to our rightful place, and there we shall lead all vampire-kind.
I would advise you to be... careful about what words you choose next.
you psychotic bloodsuckers.
Roman was the only one keeping a lid on this.
he was the only one stopping the world from sliding back into the Dark Ages.
Roman was an infidel who defied the word of Lilith.
and now he's gone.
you strike me as a man of integrity, General Cavanaugh.
also a pragmatist.
now this is the situation that we find ourselves in.
you can join us or not.
I sincerely hope that you choose the path forward.
we have video of Russell Edgington and Steve Newlin eviscerating 22 fraternity brothers at the local Gamma Kappa Tau house last night.
there are copies of this.
if anything happens to me now or in the future, this is gonna be released to the public.
you assured the world, you assured the president that Russell Edgington was dead, and you lied.
so if that video goes viral, the human population is gonna rise up against vampires faster than you can say "Molotov cocktail."
your threats are empty, General.
are you really that stupid?
we're prepared.
you don't think we've been planning for this? We have weapons.
weapons you have never heard of.
we own the day.
vampires don't stand a fucking chance.
now there's only one person standing between you and all-out war with the humans, and you're looking at him.
so I suggest you think very carefully about what you say next.
that's what I thought.
Oh, God. -- God is a vampire.
Oh, my.
Hi, Jason.
what's going on? Who are these guys?
um... Hey, guys, you're kind of cramping my style. Do you mind?
your maker told me to supervise, so that's what I'm going to do... supervise.
okay.
um... Jason, we've been through a lot together, and I think through all of that, you know, we've learned we can trust each other.
I don't know about that.
it's kind of been one of our issues.
just saying. -- Yeah, I know.
but I think you know that you can trust me.
and I know that I can trust you to do the right thing.
well, that's another thing... we never do the right thing.
the right thing would be not sleeping with each other behind Hoyt's back.
you, me, we try to be good people, but that don't mean that we are.
this is getting tiresome. We need to get you two in the ground.
let me do this.
if you don't do it, I will.
what the hell is he talking about?
fuck it.
trust me.
No!
Oh, fuck!
you fucking idiot. What the fuck is wrong with you?
do you have any idea what you have done?
he was a dick.
I'm glad he killed the bloated windbag.
they have weapons. Now we're vulnerable.
he was bluffing. -- You're all missing the point.
I'm just saying I have known this rattlesnake.
I knew his family. -- Shut up, Rosalyn!
we need to clear this up. -- What do we do?
listen!
I admit, I might have been a bit impulsive here, but I can fix this.
I'll go on a glamouring campaign, eliminate all memory that the video exists.
it'll be like none of this ever happened.
Yes, and I know the general's chief of staff.
if we act quickly, we can contain the situation.
okay, go. Take the AVL jet and report back when it is done.
take a security detail.
might need the backup.
of course.
I'll handle the general's entourage.
baby, I am so sorry.
it's gonna be okay,'cause you're gonna wake up a vampire.
you shouldn't cry, little girl.
this is a happy day.
when you and Prince Charming wake tomorrow night, he can bite you right back.
should we pick up some takeout on our way back?
do it.
fuck! -- I'm sorry.
fuck! -- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I tried not to drink too much of your blood.
Why?
Russell Edgington and Steve Newlin, they are coming for Sookie, and Bill and Eric have gone crazy on vampire religion and nobody is gonna save her this time.
Oh, Jesus. -- Wait, Jason.
what? -- I know this wasn't real.
but if I was gonna have to spend eternity with somebody...
I mean... I wasn't faking that part.
I've got to go warn Sookie.
we cleaned it all up.
there's not a drop of Elijah anywhere.
I went over this place with a toothbrush.
killing a sheriff... this is going to go up the chain.
what chain? -- The fucking Authority.
what's the damn Authority?
it's our government and church combined.
the church runs the government.
like the Vatican? -- Kind of.
they hand down the laws and we follow them.
it's how it works.
well, the Pope can fuck me and so can the Authority.
they can both keep their laws off of my body.
the Authority can do whatever they want with you and your body.
we're not going to talk about this ever again.
but do you think... -- For fuck's sake, Tara.
as your maker, I command you to never speak of Sheriff Stormer and his untimely true death.
Oh, hey. -- What the hell happened to you?
I need you to hide me. -- No.
why not?
since when did I become a halfway house for wayward baby vamps?
whatever trouble you're in, leave me out of it.
I got enough of my own.
I know where Eric is.
where? -- I'll tell you if you hide me.
don't play games with me, you little ginger bitch.
hide me.
get her a coffin out of storage.
answers, now.
and despite what AVL spokesperson Steve Newlin said in his debate tonight, local business has dropped off 75%, leading to worries that dwindling supplies of True Blood coupled with the struggling economy...
you guys mind if I change the station?
now becoming for us.
dawn in two minutes.
please retire to quarters. Security protocols initiated.
where the hell are we?
I think we're underground. -- What is this place?
a fucking vampire secret headquarters?
Emma's here somewhere.
remember, it is truly a great honor to meet the Elder.
who is she, exactly?
she's the oldest fairy to escape through the portal.
there's only one problem. -- It's not a problem.
the Elder has been through so many realms, she's assumed so many shapes and spoken so many languages that she sometimes has a difficult time... focusing.
focusing?
she operates on many frequencies at once.
time has no meaning for her.
but you think she can help me?
we shall see.
your Grace.
this is Sookie Stackhouse, the halfling you were told about.
Ke$ha... for or against?
excuse me?
do you like her music? -- I'm sorry.
I'm not that familiar with her music.
she doesn't really sing, does she?
she talks.
I suppose that makes her some sort of a poet.
that's alarming because her spelling is atrocious.
ha! Leave us.
begging your pardon, Miss Elder.
Maurella said that you might know my great-great-great, like, times 15 grandfather John Stackhouse.
Yes, I did know him.
he was a landowner. Very handsome.
bit of a creep. No offense.
none taken.
do you know why he might have promised me to a vampire named Warlow?
it is forbidden to speak of these things.
what things? -- John Cougar Mellencamp, for or against?
against. What things?
look, there is a reason that you find vampires irresistible, a reason that you slut your heart out to every cute guy out there with fangs.
I beg your pardon? -- You, me, Warlow... our destinies are entwined.
Yes, okay, but what is that supposed to mean?
a dark time is coming. You will be tested.
hold on to your light.
as long as we fairies control our light, we will be free.
Boyz II Men, for or against?
for. I'm sorry, I know you have trouble with frequencies, but there's a creepy vampire ghost air monster who killed my parents and now he's coming to get me and I really need you to give me something concrete, something useful.
my apologies.
there's so much information in my head.
eons of data.
Warlow is very... -- Sookie!
Sook! I've got to talk to you!
Jason. -- Let me in!
where is she? -- He's been bitten.
we got to hide you right now.
Oh, my God. What happened to you? Are you okay?
forget this. Russell Edgington and Steve Newlin, they're coming for you. Bill, Eric, they've both gone crazy.
they found vampire religion, so nobody's coming to save you.
Russell Edgington is alive?
Yeah. -- Please, Miss Elder, you said Warlow is... ?
Russell Edgington is alive?
hey there, sunshine.
good morning, Sheriff Bellefleur.
egg sandwich, crispy bacon, large coffee, extra milk, extra sugar.
you're so sweet, you make the food here taste good.
I got a little something else for you.
my boys here have something they want to say to you.
uh, hey, Sheriff Bellefleur.
uh, I just want to say that I'm sorry for putting your butt up on Facebook.
uh, it was wrong and it seems like you're making my mom real happy.
you know, way happier than my pops ever did.
so, sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
sorry that I cannot scrape the image of your ass from the back wall of my mind.
sorry I'm gonna have to waste all of my mama's hard-earned tips to pay for years of therapy and probably end up incarcerated anyway.
rocky Cleary, you quit your sass right now.
you can't make me say stuff that I don't feel.
it's all right, Holly.
he's got no reason to trust me. Yet.
but I'm gonna make you boys a promise.
I am gonna do right by your mama for as long as she'll have me.
you can take that to the bank.
banks suck. They took our house.
it's a figure of speech, son.
what do you say?
come on.
all right.
no, that's all right. Okay.
all righty, then.
I'll see you at lunch.
Alcide, look at you.
ain't seen you since you was a pup.
Mr. Rollins.
what do you want?
just out warning folks.
there's been a bunch of baby vamp attacks in Madison and Rankin Counties.
kills are messy, savage.
we think the vamps are upping their numbers, turning folks, letting them run wild.
baby vamps are forming into packs, hunting.
coming our way.
silver-plated box fence won't stop the grown vamps, but it'll keep the baby ones out.
get off my land.
good to see you're still a son of a bitch, Herveaux.
I come out here out of respect for a man I once knew.
no good deed goes unpunished, I guess.
you were a Packmaster, but you threw it all away.
I was forced out by you turncoats.
don't let your old man drag you down, Alcide.
he's quicksand.
Rollins is a lying shit.
comes out here acting all high and mighty.
he can go to hell.
can't trust him, that's the truth.
you did it.
so why don't we just stop pretending like you didn't?
you stole that money from the pack.
that's why they kicked you out.
and there ain't a damn thing you can do to change that.
I don't need Rollins coming out here digging up ancient history.
and I sure as hell don't need my kid passing judgment.
you get it?
whatever happened to pack first?
pack left me out here to rot.
pack can go fuck themselves.
listen to me!
Russell Edgington is gonna keep coming for me.
he's not gonna stop.
and after he's gotten me, he's gonna come for you.
now, I don't know about you guys, but I am tired of running.
we have to fight him, all of us together.
I'm sorry. It's suicide.
and yet we must.
we, the fairy tribe of Bon Temps, in this plane, in this time, will fight with you, Sookie Stackhouse.
you clear on the plan? Just be honest.
tell the truth.
no, I won't have to tell the truth.
cause I'm gonna kill him. -- You don't have to do that.
you could just stay here with me.
no, I want to do it.
Sook, if there's one thing I learned from my time as QB-1, it's that the best defense is a good offense.
so no more pussyfooting around Russell.
it's game time.
I love you.
I love you, too, Sook.
you give him hell.
I always do.
Hey, y'all. Here you go.
Terry Bellefleur, you're gonna get me in trouble.
Sam's not even around.
Yeah, but Lafayette is a snitch.
I'm a bitch, not a snitch.
love it.
I'm so glad to see y'all back and happy and, you know, in love and all.
thank you, cuz. I appreciate that.
she saves my life every day.
how do you make it last for the long haul?
well... I think it starts with trust.
trust most of all. -- Yeah.
and honesty. Got to have honesty.
Yeah, that, too. -- And loyalty.
you got to know that person's gonna be there for you through thick and thin 'cause you never know when some Iraqi ghost lady is gonna curse your entire family.
there you are.
Maurella, what are you doing here?
there's danger afoot, Andrew.
you swore on the light to protect me and the fruit of our union.
did you put that bun in her oven?
but I just saw you about a week ago, and you weren't pregnant.
that was the night we conceived.
one week ago, and now you're... -- Yes. Right on schedule.
look, Maurella, you seem like a lovely person.
Mmm, I am.
and I know that we have... -- Twice.
but I'm not stupid.
a lot of people might think I'm stupid, but those people are wrong.
no, I don't think you're stupid.
well, apparently you do if you think you can pull this over on me.
did you or did you not swear upon the light?
all I know is your finger lit up and I touched it.
you accepted my light into you.
otherwise I never would have shared flesh with you.
twice.
but I can't... I got a good thing starting with Holly.
and I just feel more comfortable with somebody who's the same species.
to ignore the light pact will bring great dishonor upon me and all my clan.
it is an act of war.
bill... I've never seen him like that.
he was cold, cruel even.
that's nest behavior.
when vampires live together for a long time and feed off of each other's blood, they form a nest and become sadistic and crazy.
from what you're telling me, drinking that Lilith's blood is making them into a nest on steroids.
have you ever been in a nest?
Eric and I have steered clear.
I find most vampires as irritating as most humans.
are you worried about Eric?
he's a big boy. He can take care of himself.
well, thank you again for letting me stay here.
totally. Maybe later we can braid each other's hair and talk about boys.
fucking baby vamps.
she's all bark, isn't she?
Nah, she's a lot of bark and a lot of bite.
do you like her?
what?
you know, like... like, like her.
no.
why would you even say something like that?
I'm just asking.
I don't know that many people of the gay persuasion.
it just looked like maybe you two were getting along.
I'm sorry, but you have no idea what you're talking about.
I didn't say that I did. That's why I was asking.
Pam and me... never gonna happen.
okay. Fine. Sorry I asked.
why you feel the need to get all up in my business?
cause I don't have any friends.
I don't have anyone to talk to.
and even if you freak out and go crazy now and again and beat me up,
I'm a vampire now, so I heal.
and I like talking to you.
I'll try and bring you a fangbanger later.
Thanks.
we're all out of True Blood.
what else you serving?
you're welcome to try your luck with this fine cross section of humanity.
I'm looking for someone. My progeny.
he's sheriff of these parts.
came by here last night.
we paid our taxes and he moved on.
Oh, is that right? -- Yeah.
I can smell Elijah's blood on you.
a maker always knows when her progeny dies.
he was only one of 204, but it's still like a cold spike in your heart.
who killed him? Was it you?
it was me.
what possessed you to murder my progeny?
he was getting on my nerves.
in the name of the one true Vampire Authority, in whose wisdom and justice all is made manifest by Lilith,
I arrest you for the murder of Sheriff Elijah Stormer.
your daddy is looking for you.
only one can lead us.
I choose you.
I'm not worthy.
drink of me.
drink all of me.
he's all over the guy.
he's hanging all over the fucking guy, you blind prick!
fucking. I'm healing.
don't go out there.
they're heading over to the Reeves place.
you always got to be the fucking hero.
you raised me to be a man and a wolf, not a thief and a coward.
Jesus!
I actually met him.
he was a boring hippie who stank of patchouli.
Hi, Jason.
Oh, look.
we got ourselves a hunk sandwich.
get your fucking hands off me. Get off me!
Where's your sister?
Yeah, you ain't never gonna find her.
cause she's someplace you can't get in.
and where might that be?
she's with the fairies.
what fairies?
there's a bunch of them.
they got a club out by the Thibodeaux Farm.
how about you lead us to this spritely smorgasbord?
okay.
stay just like that until we find her.
Oh, you bet.
who knows how to show you a good time?
you do.
come out here!
we're not gonna hurt ya. -- We're just gonna eat ya.
let's flip this fucker. -- Leave her be!
when we die, we're goo?
you're already dead.
Emma? -- Oh, shit.
what the fuck kind of monsters are you?
hey there, baby.
you're fine. Just don't shift.
we have to hurry.
what the fuck are you doing out?
shift. -- I'm not gonna leave her.
we won't.
chancellor Compton is requesting his breakfast.
Hey, wait. I'll go.
that's a first. You in a hurry to die?
just as soon get it over with.
do whatever you have to!
chancellor?
Lilith came to me.
she chose me.
no.
she chose me!
take her to the cells.
chelsea, will you please page Chancellor Compton?
what the fuck are you doing here?
what are you doing here? Hey, help Luna!
who the fuck is Luna?
fuck you!
chancellor Compton, your progeny will meet you in the main chamber.
what do you have to say for yourself?
I'm sorry.
I just... when I got there, Jason wasn't into it.
I didn't think it was right.
so you decided it would be better to kill two vampires instead?
that security guy, he was gonna make me turn him.
he was doing his job... following my orders.
you chose a human over two vampires.
he's not a human. He's Jason.
you staked Longshadow for Sookie.
Lilith commands that vampire hath dominion over human.
who cares about Lilith?
Pam says you are in a nest and it is making you crazy.
I am the chosen one!
Lilith chose me!
only one can lead us.
I choose you.
drink of me.
drink all of me.
baby, let me out.
baby, open the door.
what is that smell?
fairy.
where are they?
right there.
where?
there.
that smell. -- Where are they?
I can feel them. They're all around me.
what fucking fairy magic is this?
where are they?
Oh, mercy!
what are you waiting for? -- We're ready to fight.
Jason brought them here. That was the plan.
the plan has changed.
where are you, fairy?
Sookie Stackhouse, I will tear your brother limb from limb unless you show yourself.
we have to fight them.
I'm not letting you out there to get yourselves killed.
you said we were... -- Don't worry. I got this.
as I live and breathe.
a fairy.
impressive.
you are turbocharged.
vampire, I hereby banish you to the realms and beyond.
Begone!
I said begone.
Oh, sweet merciful fuck!
that was delicious!
heaven, your name is fairy.
Oh, God. He can see us.
why, thank you so much.
I'd love to come to dinner.
we have video of Russell Edgington and Steve Newlin eviscerating 22 fraternity brothers.
if anything happens to me now or in the future, this is gonna be released to the public.
I'll go on a glamouring campaign, eliminate all memory that the video exists.
take a security detail. - Might need the backup.
just out warning folks.
been a bunch of baby vamp attacks.
leave her be!
only one can lead us. I choose you.
drink the blood. Drink it all.
Lilith chose me. - She chose me!
Russell Edgington is gonna keep coming for me.
and after he's got me, he's gonna come for you.
I can smell Elijah's blood on you.
who killed him? - It was me.
I arrest you for the murder of Sheriff Elijah Stormer.
Hey, there, baby. - We have to hurry.
what are you doing out?
chancellor Compton is requesting his breakfast.
I'll go. - Maurella.
you swore to protect the fruit of our union.
Pam says you are in a nest and it is making you crazy.
I am the chosen one!
I choose you.
drink all of me.
Where's your sister? - She's someplace you can't get in.
and where might that be? - She's with the fairies.
where are they? - We have to fight them.
Begone!
Oh, God. He can see us.
I'd love to come to dinner.
blast him!
seriously, is that the best you can do?
I can't even feel it except for a very slight tingling sensation, which, unfortunately for you gorgeous little pixies, only whets my appetite!
well...
Oh, fuck.
well, that felt even better than I thought it would.
Jason! - No!
Sookie! - There are still vampires out there.
what is that amazing smell?
you will not feed on Sookie.
what is she? - She's a waitress, a waitress who's saved my life more than once and whose fear vibe very graciously brought me here tonight, allowing me to settle an ancient debt.
thank you for that, by the way.
but I want her.
are you really this undisciplined?
God, Jason. Are you okay?
Jason, wake up.
now, Father would be very disappointed.
Jason, come on. - All right, I won't eat her.
swear on Godric. - Please.
Jason, come on. - Swear on Godric.
I swear on Godric.
wake up. Jason.
Jason, are you okay?
Jason, baby.
mama?
what?
Jason, it's me, Sookie.
drink of me.
drink all of me.
chancellor Compton.
Oh, good. Breakfast.
this is a shifter.
can you not smell the difference?
you guys really don't spend much time in the outside world, do you?
ungag him.
bill, just hear me out. - You should never have come here.
my girlfriend's daughter was kidnapped by Steve Newlin.
I just want to get her back. - But now you know too much.
I give you my word, I will never... - I can't trust that!
God damn it, he flew into the ventilation duct.
Oh, and by the way, we've been breached.
how could I have lived for so long and never encountered a fairy?
because the only thing you ever cared about was rising up the ranks of the Authority.
overachiever.
well, somebody had to do something to make Father proud.
it must kill you that he loved me more.
it kills me that you think he did.
they got Pam.
you're insane to go back in there.
she's my progeny, Nora. She's family.
she's a former prostitute.
we're going just as soon as we stash this somewhere safe.
you sure this thing is light-tight?
looks like Tupperware.
it's 100% light-tight and virtually indestructible.
are you kidding? Even I can destroy it.
Oh, by the way, she's family, too. So be nice to her.
maybe I should take you to the emergency room.
you're acting pretty weird.
it's a wonder one of those fangers ain't killed your baby sister by now.
lord knows they tried.
Jason, are you even hearing me?
what the...?
Oh, my God, Tara.
are you okay?
Oh, fuck, Tara.
I forgot that you were...one of them.
well, this reminds me. You still haven't gotten around to transferring the ownership of my house back to me.
a fucking fanger owns my mama's house?
I'll do it first thing tomorrow night.
ain't right. - If we survive tonight.
what the fuck are you talking about?
I need you to come with us into the Vampire Authority.
they got Bill and Jessica.
and Pam. - And you owe Pam.
there ain't no fucking way
I'm gonna let her go anywhere with you.
Jason, I got this.
what about Mama and Daddy?
Sook, you ought to tell all these fucking fangers to go back to hell where they came from.
something funny, fanger?
Yes, bloodbag. - Leech.
breather. - Dead fuck.
Meatsack. - Stop acting like children.
you smell like something I once dreamed of.
Eric, please ask your sister not to look at me like that.
look, I already know vampires are behind the Tru Blood factory bombings.
bill was behind those bombings.
and he did it to force mainstreaming vampires to feed on humans.
now, we've got to get him out of there before he loses himself completely.
now, if anybody can get through to him, it's you.
and you owe Pam.
okay.
Sook, please don't do this.
don't you want to save Jessica?
just think how many vampers you can kill in there, champ.
okay.
but I'm coming with you.
Oh, sweetie, don't be a fool.
if I wanna be a fool, then I will be a fool.
that is my God-given right as an American.
breached.
what does that mean exactly?
or you tend to our human livestock, you fucked up.
do you have any idea how many people, human and vampire, want to see us all dead?
well, thanks for making it easier for them.
but ultimately what matters most is what lies just on the other side of that door.
the actual essence of the very first of our kind.
God's blueprint for us.
scour every inch of this place.
have fun.
whatever you find, kill it.
and if it doesn't shift back into human form after it's dead, then keep on looking.
dismissed.
have you seen Chancellor Akinjide?
I found him earlier in the blood shrine.
he was about to drink all of the sacred blood.
so I killed him.
because Lilith appeared to me.
she said you were chosen.
she told me to serve and protect you.
just breathe, baby.
we're gonna get out of here soon, okay?
I promise.
I tried reasoning. Apparently he's lost his motherfucking mind.
I'm gonna case this place, which is huge, by the way, and there are surveillance cameras everywhere.
so if they come for you, shift.
I'm not leaving her.
Emma's safe.
she's a pet. They don't feed on wolves.
I'm not leaving her.
you're not gonna be much use to her dead, now, are you?
now listen.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
if they come for you, shift and escape.
there's ventilation ducts in the ceiling.
I'll find you and we'll come back for Emma.
good luck.
don't be scared.
they're religious fanatics, both of them.
well, I can totally believe it about Bill.
he's always looking for something to feel guilty about.
but Eric, no way.
I'm telling you, they're worse than my uncle who started his own church.
he told my cousins there was no Santa Claus when they were little just so that Jesus wouldn't have any competition.
Eric has always made such fun of religion.
not in here.
it's like they're in a cult.
you know, their eyes get crazy.
and you know how crazy feeds crazy?
they want to conquer the world and they're just crazy enough to do it.
one of the worst things about being immortal
it's usually the humans, though.
guess this proves we're just as fucking retarded as they are.
I still can't believe Eric and Bill weren't even gonna warn Sookie
Russell Edgington was coming after her.
must all roads lead to fucking Sookie?
they were just gonna let him drain her, all because according to their vampire Bible, she's an abomination.
maybe there's something to this religion after all.
it took both of us to take that buck down this morning.
sure would be a shame if you overcooked it.
take down one vamp, and all of a sudden you're the world's expert on everything?
any advice you want to give me on how I'm dressed?
now that you mention it, I do have a few ideas of how you can play to your strengths a little better.
maybe we can go get a mani-pedi.
worst part of being a parent
no matter how hard you try, you can't keep your kids from eventually learning what a shithole this world is, how corrupt, mean, arbitrary.
and you just want to shield them from it, let them believe life is safe and fair.
bad gets punished.
good gets rewarded.
cause if they can believe that, you almost can, too.
but when you yourself end up being the one to teach them how fucked up things are...
well, that's a hell of a thing to ever come back from.
dad, I heard this exact same speech before.
more than once.
words are great...
deeds are better.
Yup, it's the deeds I always had a hard time with, huh?
not always.
thank God you're here, Alcide.
I don't know where else I would have turned. Help me get Rikki out of the car.
Alcide, they made me drink it.
death.
I wanted to fucking puke it up, and then I wanted more.
I wanted to kill everything that ever lived, rip out its heart and eat it raw.
don't fucking touch me, dyke!
Hey, come here. - Oh, yeah!
you like it rough. Take your pants off, cowboy.
I'll show you what a real werebitch can do.
he says they'll need it to fight the holy wars.
I'm afraid she might have OD'd.
I'm afraid she might die, Alcide.
shouldn't you try to be a little less conspicuous?
I mean, given our cargo.
these days, if anyone knew what was inside those things...
honestly, Sook, somebody wants to pop 'em open and fry these bitches up, they can be my guest.
Jason. Jason, these are our friends.
they ain't my friends.
we're gonna need their help getting into the Authority.
and once we're in, anything with fangs is fair game.
this isn't funny.
I'm on it, Daddy, tonight.
Jason, killing a bunch of vampires won't bring Mama and Daddy back.
no, but it'll make me feel better. - Jason!
well, don't just stand there bellyaching.
fill up the bag. - No, not until you look at me.
Eric, Tara, and Nora, they're on our side.
they want to get Bill out of there before things get--- Before things what?
spin out of control?
that train has already sailed.
I'm so proud of you taking such good care of your sister.
there's a fucking war coming.
cause she is living in a dream world.
it's us against them, and that is the sad reality.
damn straight. Us or them.
so if I have to kill Bill tonight or any of the rest of them, I am gonna do it.
and you'd better be prepared to do the same.
the time for tolerance is over.
infamous vampire terrorist Russell Edgington, recorded by a security camera at a Louisiana fraternity house, the site of a brutal vampire attack that claimed 22 lives.
colloidal silver? - Yeah.
makes the V want to leave the body, usually through sweat.
it's not a pleasant feeling, but once it's passed, she'll feel better.
that's good to know.
you mean if I could have got some of this into JD, we could have had a real Packmaster competition, fair and square?
he was a good wolf once.
weren't we all?
it's working its way out of you, honey.
did JD do anything else to you?
um, maybe I'll tell you if you tell me why you couldn't pick up a phone and let me know where you were.
you just left without a word.
don't pretend like that night didn't mean anything to you.
I'm not. It did.
tell me what happened.
jd called a pack meeting.
said it was an emergency.
when we got there, they held us down.
he poured it into our mouths.
is that all?
it was for me...
but not for some of the younger girls.
he might have been a good wolf once, but he isn't anymore.
clearly.
if he wasn't all jacked up on V, I'd kill him right now.
but as it is, he practically killed me.
the only way to beat him is to play by his rules.
if he's on the same blood that Rikki's on, it's some seriously inferior shit.
I got some of the best shit available
I keep for special occasions just like this one.
lots of folks wanted to kill me over the years.
I do what I have to to stay alive.
Hey. - I have an idea.
will it work?
I hope so.
okay.
Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.
Hey, bitches. I made some Cajun margaritas.
I do not want to even know what is in that.
Oh, but you want to taste it.
I do.
Oh, my goddess.
that is amazing.
Mmm. You look like you can use a cup.
Oh, I don't know. It's pretty close to sundown.
Oh, come on, peaches. Just a little sippy-sip.
after the last few days, you deserve a little R&R.
I heard that, girl.
Mmm! God, it's like candy.
lafayette, what is this music?
I don't even want to think about how many hours of my life I've spent listening to Sam Merlotte's redneck-ass taste in music.
I'm gonna take full advantage of his absence and listen to something decent for a change.
Oh, all right. Something nasty.
Oh, look at him work that thing.
roll it out. - Uh-oh.
okay, you mind just sitting tight here for a while so I can talk to my friend privately?
cause what I got to say to her is not gonna be too easy.
take your time.
Oh, will you get me some salt first?
so you got a big date tonight?
Hey, Sheriff.
Oh, hey, Miss Bodehouse.
Andy, Jane, please.
haven't we slept together by now?
I don't think so. - I think we slept together at some point.
in the woods.
Nope, wasn't me.
Andy, you slept with Jane Bodehouse? When?
no, she's drunk. - I am.
well, I'm glad you didn't.
I don't like the way that made me feel.
Really?
how'd it make you feel?
like something special that only we share was suddenly not so special anymore.
and that made me sad.
can we talk?
alone?
sure.
when did Andy Bellefleur get to be so fucking hot?
Holly, I really care about you.
I haven't felt something like this since
well, my whole life.
who was it and how many times?
her name's Maurella.
and twice.
once a couple weeks ago before you and I had ever...
and the other time was almost a week ago, clearly after we had-- I'm so sorry.
and now she's pregnant and she refuses to go to St. Francis.
says her kind don't whelp in hospitals.
my-- my light broke.
my beautiful prophet.
bill's not evil.
I know him.
and starting a civil war between vampires and humans it's not who he really is.
poor thing, blinded by love.
too scared to let herself see the truth.
you ever think anyone can really know anybody else?
I mean, don't we just see what makes us feel good?
I think you can know somebody else.
it's not easy and it's not always nice, but going through some life-changing experiences with that person can help you... - Really?
it seems to me that philosophy ain't exactly working for you.
I mean, you just keep falling for boys who are dead.
ain't that like the ultimate in being unavailable?
I really don't think that's why I... - No, hey, me, too.
every last one of them unavailable in some basic unavailable way.
you know, the problem is us.
we think we don't deserve better than that.
maybe we don't.
it is not a question of deserving.
it is a question of thinking life owes you something.
it doesn't.
Jason, I know you've got a lot to deal with right now, but you can't let it tear you down like this.
why the hell not?
maybe we'd be better off going through life without thinking there's something good waiting for us down the road.
maybe we wouldn't keep getting hurt if we just expected the worst.
that's right, champ. Vampers made you orphans.
learn from it.
cause that's all we've been getting. - No.
I refuse to think that way.
well, that's your choice.
but you've got to let me think that way if I want to.
okay.
how's your head?
Jason, that's as big as a walnut.
pull over. - Fuck, man!
please?
I cannot believe I am midwifing for your pregnant girlfriend that I just found out about.
believe me, I'd prefer this was not happening just as much as you.
okay, we're almost there, honey, okay? Just keep breathing. - Oh, yes. Yes!
Yes! Yes!
this doesn't seem too hard for you.
I'm guessing this isn't your first pregnancy.
73 times since I first discovered how.
okay, that's extreme.
who knew watching an alien give birth could be so comforting?
are you kidding me? It's always the weird stuff that's the best.
shit.
it's a girl with no umbilical cord. - Oh, my God.
you'd better be good to her, Andy Bellefleur.
she's gonna have a hard enough time as it is being a woman in this world.
I will. I swear.
I have no idea what's happening.
who does, baby Jane? Who does?
uh, we're not done.
I got it.
Hi, baby.
I've got you, baby, and I am never letting you go.
do not shift.
thank you. She's been cooped up for hours.
could use a little playtime.
Reverend Newlin.
I aced my statistics exam.
you did? That's fantastic.
go, Chelsea! Go, Chelsea!
Yes, Chelsea, go.
so I thought I would take Emma here for a little walk.
Oh, well, do you want me to have someone do that for you?
No! Thank you.
I-- I like doing it. It gives us a little bonding time.
Where's your Southern accent?
sometimes...
I like to not have a Southern accent.
Really? But it's such a part of who you are, of your brand.
Yes, but sometimes...
I like to keep the brand evolving so consumers are more inclined to stay on their toes.
but doesn't that make it more complicated for consumers and isn't that like a huge no-no?
that is a very good question, which I will have to get back to you on, Chelsea.
Reverend Newlin, you do know that we're on lockdown, don't you?
Newlin, you fucking little dipshit.
just because you couldn't keep your fangs in your pants, could you?
now, I'm gonna need you on damage control ASAP.
not that you actually can control 22 dead frat boys.
access granted.
are you fucking deaf?
get in here!
what the fuck were you and Edgington thinking?
and where is he? Or Kibwe?
clearly Gainesborough and Northman weren't successful.
the government probably killed them and is coming out for us now.
you stupid little bitch!
Yeah, well, for a normal red-blooded American human, giving birth ain't nothing like that.
Yes! - Hell, she make me want to do it.
another girl.
Hey, sweetie.
take good care of them.
wait a minute. You ain't thinking about leaving them with me?
you sired them.
now it is your sacred duty to see that at least half of them survive into adulthood.
Whoa! That ain't.
the light pact has been made flesh now.
I honor what was, what is, and what will never be.
farewell, Andy Bellefleur.
that was awesome.
you're a dick.
drinks on me, everybody.
who's up first?
shut the fuck up, dead man.
ain't no such thing as too much V.
that's enough, JD!
the fuck?
I abjured you.
abjure this.
stay out of it.
this is between JD and Alcide.
I think you've won this one, son.
Oh, my God!
guess we got a new Packmaster.
this stops tonight.
we're wolves. We respect ourselves.
we respect our pack.
we respect nature without exception.
we do not surrender to nihilism.
we do not take advantage of those who are younger or weaker than we are.
this is how it's going to be in this pack from now on.
and if you don't like it, then you have 24 hours to get the hell out or you face me right now.
tonight...
we choose pack.
chancellors.
we weren't expecting you until tomorrow evening.
well, our flight was aborted halfway to DC.
no one has told us why or was there to meet us when we got back to New Orleans.
has there been trouble? - There's been a breach.
a shape-shifter. We're still on lockdown.
I'll need to call this in.
chelsea, I have Chancellors Northman and Gainesborough at the gate requesting access.
what's your cargo? - The vampire's a mainstreaming spy.
the humans are lunch.
the blonde smells amazing.
Yeah, she is pretty amazing.
and mine.
Roger.
they're just trying to track down a chancellor.
of course. Send Chancellor Northman and his party on down.
you've been cleared. - Thank you.
fuckin' igits!
as usual, everything falls to me.
I can't ever find anybody. Compton and Salome are off buttering each other's biscuits half the time.
you know, I hate to say this, but ever since Roman cashed in his chips, the work ethic around here has just gone straight to hell.
okay, you look a little nervous.
now you are not gonna veer off this script.
wait a minute. We're going live in five?
is that five minutes? - Five seconds.
and you'd better sell the shit out of this, preacher man, 'cause it looks like you and Russell may have just started a war.
the surveillance video, which has become an Internet sensation, shows Reverend Newlin and someone who appears to be Russell Edgington entering the fraternity house where those 22 young men were later found drained of their blood.
joining me now live via satellite, American Vampire League spoke erson Steve Newlin himself.
Reverend Newlin, thanks for joining us.
it's my pleasure, Suzanne, to be able to refuse-- refute these heinous charges, which have obviously been fabricated by a sick and hateful mind.
can we please start with the cheap and obviously manufactured vid--video?
Reverend Newlin?
Rev-- Reverend? Reverend, are you all right?
Christ!
I did not see that shit coming.
vampires are keeping humans prisoner in an underground bunker somewhere in New Orleans.
they are feeding on them. They're killing them!
come here, baby. Here we go. Okay, all right. You're fine.
thank you, Lilith,
o Mother, for the gift you have bestowed upon me.
and I swear upon my life thy will shall be done.
vampires shall rightfully rule this earth.
now.
guide me, O Mother, as I surrender to you completely.
initiating level two protocols.
go! - Initiating level two protocols.
stay back!
in five, four... - Clear.
three, two, one. Level two protocols.
watch out, it's slippery.
see what you've been missing working for the fucking Authority?
control room.
great, now what?
Sookie? Hi. - Jessica.
you okay? - What the fuck are you doing?
I'm getting you the fuck out of jail, bitch.
y'all need to hold tight. We need to wait a second here.
wait? For what?
Eric and Nora to disarm and unlock everything.
nice plan. - Sure beats yours.
no, wait, you've got to do that thing first.
can you not... - You've got to reroute the sensors.
that's the first thing I did. - No, you didn't. Please, let me just...
do you honestly think that you understand the system I helped design better than I do?
okay, maybe not.
come on. I know you're out there.
suck on that, you dead piece of shit.
Oh, Sookie, can you get these doors?
right,'cause they're made of silver and y'all are vampires. Duh.
Oh, okay. - I knew it!
quite the ritualistic tone you're setting.
do you not think the occasion befitting?
tonight, Lilith's darkest dream will be made real.
I'm sorry.
I know you want this for yourself, but I was chosen.
Lilith in her wisdom wanted the strongest.
I'm glad you're here to witness.
you will tell this story many times.
think about this.
you don't know what drinking all of it will do.
Lilith knows.
that's good enough for me.
if it were to affect you...adversely, you would be a tremendous loss to the movement.
this is not a movement, Bill.
this is the fucking rapture.
all you've seen and you still doubt?
that is why I am stronger.
apparently.
come on, now.
Jason, it's us.
Oh, clear. Come on.
fuck.
Oh, my God.
it's good to see you. I've missed you so much.
I've been an idiot and I love you and I can't ever love a vampire.
sorry. I can't do it.
they'll be waiting for you up top, so I suggest you all reload on the ride up.
hello.
wait, aren't you coming with us?
we're going to get Bill.
Eric, you can't be serious. - Sookie!
make sure it's safe up there for us. We'll be up momentarily.
of course it was a competition.
but the weak spot for you, Salome, and it always has been, is that you're not very good at predicting an adversary's behavior.
possibly because of your monumental narcissism.
you were so impatient for the rapture that you didn't even smell the silver in the blood.
and I put in a lot.
but I knew that you would never smell it because you were too impatient in your lust for greatness.
You...defiled the Mother's blood...with silver?
I would never desecrate the Holy Grail.
Lilith...chose wisely.
so, Lilith appeared to you as well.
only to savagely obliterate my maker.
she's a mad god, Bill.
she's nothing but destruction.
don't do it.
so you can?
pour it in the fucking fire.
you'll never stop me.
so why'd you authorize our entry, then?
you knew we would try.
because I wasn't yet sure I'd be able to get rid of Salome on my own.
bill, this isn't you.
what the fuck do you know about me?
for all you know, everything I did while with you was an act calculated to elicit a particular response.
I know that's not true.
why, because of the light you bear?
did you ever consider the possibility that it's a handicap?
one that blinds you to the most obvious of truths--that you are an abomination, just like the vampire Bible states.
bill, you are stronger than this.
you are capable of sympathy and kindness and generosity.
you are unique among all the vampires I have met.
don't throw that away.
I have spent my entire life as a vampire apologizing, believing I was inherently wrong somehow, living in fear--fear that God had forsaken me, that I was damned.
but Lilith grants us freedom from fear.
vicissitudes 9: 24.
fear not, for my blood is beyond fear
fear of sin, fear of mankind, fear of retribution, for thou art begat by God.
and this world is but a spring to slake thy sacred thirst.
if I ever meant anything to you at all.
I told you the first night we met...
vampires often turn on those they love the most.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
fuck.
run!
so you want to talk the whole case through or...?
the whole story from your end, you don't mind.
that's what you all want to hear about, right.
Dora Lange, kids in the woods?
I guarantee this wasn't his first.
so she was drugged, tortured, posed out there.
is it the Fontenot girl? And why would you ask that?
went missing around here years back.
ten-year-old girl goes missing and that doesn't go state-wide?
my understanding, the little girl went off with her birth daddy.
Marty? I don't know what that is.
I haven't looked in there since the police first came.
rust, it is so nice to finally meet you.
children? - One, she passed.
marriage didn't last long after that. This is Reverend Tuttle.
we've been discussing the task force to investigate crimes with an anti-Christian connotation.
there is a war happening.
you want to talk Dori? Man, she was high.
talkin' 'bout she met a king. Can you, uh, tell us anything about that?
you were off the grid.
my question is- How could it be him...
back then, I'd sleep and
I'd lay awake thinking about women.
my daughter... my wife.
I mean, it's like... something's just got your name on it, like a, like a bullet or a nail in the road.
shit.
sorry. I drift sometimes when I've had a few. That's..
that's why I like to drink alone.
one reason, anyway.
about that sculpture thing. - Hmm.
kind of strange it turns up like that years later.
Yeah, nobody knew why that thing was in the playhouse.
I mean, the aunt reckoned maybe it was something she made in school, you know?
to me, it was like someone was having a conversation, you know?
girl's... school shut down in '92.
it closed down after Andrew.
that mean anything to you?
Oh, we notified the deceased's mother.
do you remember the last time you saw your daughter Dora?
it was a horrible, horrible thing.
we saw it on TV, what we're in the clutches of, and I prayed and prayed for that woman's family.
and it's me.
it's me.
Mrs. Kelly. - Hmm?
what about her father? Did they have a relationship?
Why? What have you heard?
I heard he passed. Is that correct?
why wouldn't a father bathe his own child?
we, uh, we were just wondering how they got on, ma'am.
he died on the road.
he drove a Peterbilt, and he took an exit too fast.
rolled over near Rowan, Oklahoma.
may 11, 1984.
when was the last time you talked to her?
you know, she's always been in some kind of trouble.
I thought things were getting better. Got away from Charlie.
she came by not too long ago, maybe a month.
she didn't talk about her daddy none.
said she'd been going to church.
do you, um, do you remember where that church was?
Oh... - Mrs. Kelly?
no.
hail Mary, full of grace. Mrs. Kelly, the Lord is with thee.
I- I get these headaches.
it's like storms. Oh.
I worked in dry-cleaning for 20 years.
the chemicals.
that's what's wrong with my nails.
piece of work, huh?
my mother- Donna Reed type.
packed lunches, bedtime stories.
your mom still alive?
maybe.
Cohle ever talk about his parents?
no. Little bit about his dad.
alaska, 'Nam.
you know, my dad, I had about 6 inches on him, and even in the end,
I still think he could have taken me.
Yeah, Marines, Korea,never talked about it.
you know, there was a time that men didn't air their bullshit to the world.
you know, it just wasn't a part of their job.
Well...family.
well, I mean, I...
I think a part of Rust's problem was there was things he needed that he couldn't admit to.
afternoon, men.
so we talked to the victim's friend next, I believe.
miss Carla? I guess she always had her mom's place, but, uh, I thought maybe she'd gotten into somethin', you know, like, uh, like gamin' again.
havin' a rough time.
what all did you all talk about? How was she?
thin, loopy, like high, usually on somethin'.
she says she found a church, but, uh- heh!
her eyes, somethin' wrong with 'em.
now, do you remember where this church was?
no.
you know where she might have been staying?
her landlord said she'd moved out last summer.
that's when I stopped seein' her so much.
she mentioned someplace down south, like around Spanish Lake, a...
shelter, girls used to stay there, something, all she said.
she sounds sad, Marty, like a torn-up person on her last legs.
she was just an easy target for him.
what do we know about him?
hits prosts, artistic, religious in some kind of way.
every person within a thousand miles of here is religious in some kind of way, except you.
how many DBs have antlers, blindfolds, painted symbols on their back, hmm?
Yeah, you know what tweakers get up to.
shit, man, this dude in New Orleans cut up his girl, felt remorse, tried to piece her back together with Krazy Glue.
that's just drug insanity.
Ah, that's not this. This has scope.
now, she articulated a person with vision.
vision is meaning. Meaning is historical.
look, she was just chum in the water, man.
days of nothing.
that's what it's like, you work cases.
days like lost dogs.
goes on like that.
you know the job.
you're looking for narrative, interrogate witnesses.
wake up, daddy.
parcel evidence, establish a timeline, and build a story day after day.
No! No!
Hey, the other night, when you were over for dinner, why didn't you leave when I had Chris call?
Mmm, I don't know.
I guess I had sobered up a little.
besides, it wasn't as bad as I thought.
and being around your family,
I liked talking to them.
bad"? Why'd you think that?
I was married, Marty, for 3 years.
we had a... baby girl.
she died.
car accident. She was two years old.
marriage couldn't handle it.
your kid died?
Oh, I...
I'm sorry, man. I am so sorry. I didn't
no, I mean, it wasn't you guys. It was just me.
I was worried...
you know, being around that kind of thing.
Hey, you were married the once, just the once?
Uh-huh. Came close another time.
Maggie introduced us, and it- it broke off.
it was for the best, you know. I gave her cause.
I can be hard to live with. You know, I...
I don't mean to, but I can be... critical.
and sometimes I think I'm just not good for people, you know, that it's not good for them to be around me.
you know, I... I wear 'em down, you know, they...
they get unhappy. - Hmm.
Yeah, I think the job does that to a lot of guys.
changes you. Some guys just notice, that's all.
well I can't say the job made me this way.
more like me being this way made me right for the job.
and I used to...
think about it more, but...
you know, you reach a certain age, you know who you are.
now I live in a little room out in the country, behind a bar.
work 4 nights a week; in between, I drink, and there ain't nobody there to stop me.
I know who I am.
after all these years, there's a...
there's a victory in that.
third day on the job, stopped this cutie for speeding.
52 minutes later, back in her dorm room.
I got my...
uniform around my knees.
ha! I'm occupied, so I don't hear anything.
I don't know that her roommate has come home - and snuck up behind us. - Oh, shit.
you know how I knew that she was in the room?
she stuck her finger up my ass!
ruined me. Now I can't do without it.
you miss some things on the job.
you know what I mean.
you got to... decompress before you can go being a family man.
what you get into working, you can't have the kids around that.
so, um, sometimes you got to get your head right.
mind if I stop by?
I don't know. Where are you?
so you're drunk.
no, I'm not, and I've hardly had anything to drink.
you never hardly have anything to drink.
I have a surprise for you.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
is that a yes?
I, uh, might stay up.
Ah.
it's for your wife and kids, too.
you got to take your release where you find it or where it finds you.
I mean, in the end, it's for the good of the family.
what's that?
Oh, well, I, uh, got you a present.
don't move a muscle. I shan't. Just the fingers.
the finger muscles.
Oh, stop.
Oh, you're very naughty.
Yes.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you can't afford an attorney, the state will provide you one.
do you understand your rights?
you definitely have a career in law enforcement.
well, I thought I was gonna put these on you.
you want this? - Ah.
yeah?
you want it?
Yes.
now, what do you mean, exactly, these visions you mentioned?
Oh, shit. I thought you knew.
I told Marty about them, you know, down the line.
uh, chemical... flashbacks, neural damage, you know, from my time in the HIDTA, as in High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.
I spent 4 years undercover.
you know what that means?
that's where they got them Fed rumors, I first come in.
what, you two don't know about them?
those files are still sealed, huh?
Shee-it.
just what have you two heard about me?
you wanted blues?
quaaludes.
Downers? - Dopey stuff.
Oh. - What's it run?
I'm thinking blue go for three a pill.
we'll say 200 for the bottle.
I thought you might just take 'em.
or that you wanted somethin' else.
some kind of somethin' else?
no.
then I was thinking, you're a good-looking man.
you wouldn't need a shakedown to get some.
what about rough trade, scary guys?
you girls talk.
around here, they're rough or whiskey-limp.
seen plenty of guys that get touchy.
something sets them off and they're like little boys.
people always go away around here.
where would I look, working girls might know the blonde?
if she was gaming I-10 south side, I heard of this place.
kind of trailer park.
girls work and stay. They call it "The Ranch."
Where's that? Like, south of Spanish Lake, supposed to be.
you know the place?
what's your deal?
I don't have a deal.
I mean, what do you do?
never mind. I thought you were gonna bust me.
I told you, I'm not interested.
Yeah, I know.
kinda strange, like you might be dangerous.
well, of course I'm dangerous.
I'm police.
I could do terrible things to people...
with impunity.
you know, what'd you do last night?
I called up here late. What were you doing?
working.
was thinking about dropping by.
where were you? I was out with girlfriends.
Uh-huh. Well, I don't like that.
what, you're jealous?
don't be stupid.
I just mean that there's a crazy man out there, and he's killing women.
wait, you mean that girl again, that Satanic thing?
everyone's still talking about that at the courthouse.
it's not just her.
there's more.
there's more? Really?
Yeah, well, we're not saying, keeping it out of the press, but...
we're thinking that he's been doing this a while.
Yeah, so no need to go out.
you just have a drink here.
I can't meet a nice man at home.
that hurts me when you speak to me in a passive-aggressive way.
I always talk straight to you.
excuse me. I meant that since you're married,
I need to be considering my options as a young woman.
I want things, Marty.
I want things, too.
Yeah, you just want your cake and to eat it, too.
how good is cake if you can't eat it?
morning.
Hey, I think I might have found something good.
bunny ranch down south, round Spanish Lake.
I thought we were pulling old johns today.
Yeah, we should do this first.
what?
you wash up. You got some pussy on you.
key to a healthy marriage.
Oh, that's Maggie, huh?
what's with your fucking nose?
nothing, man. Sorry. Forget it.
I get a connotation being implied here about my wife?
are you saying that's wife, that high tide you're walking in with?
you got some idea how my wife's pussy's supposed to smell?
no, I just meant you're wearing the same clothes as you did yesterday, coupled with the fact that I ain't stupid.
wasn't making no comment as to the particularity of the scent.
you don't say fuck-all about my wife.
don't say her name.
you got some self-loathing to do this morning, that's fine, but it ain't worth losing your hands over.
how would that work, exactly?
well, I'd just apply a couple pounds of pressure, snap your wrists.
you're Senior Detective.
think I'm lying?
you got a specific location for this place or are we just gonna wander around till we find it?
we got some names.
I'm gonna have to ask for directions.
maybe you could just follow your nose.
wherever he picked them up,
I mean, I won't lie.
however we left it, he had some moves.
he knew a few CIs from his narco days.
they knew these parts, put us in touch with some names, people to talk to.
how we doing, boys?
Hey. - Hello.
we're looking for a little bunny ranch down around these parts.
y'all know where we could find it?
no, sir. - Never heard about it?
little whorehouse? - Nuh-uh.
sorry, man.
supposed to be stuck up in the woods around here?
and I'll tell you this,
rust had about as sharp an eye for weakness as I ever seen.
I'll be right back.
it's my bad, boys.
think we got started on the wrong foot there.
you remember where that little whorehouse is, huh?
take 353 South.
gonna exit off the shoulder before we get to the 14.
from there, we take a dirt fishing road to Bayou Chenault.
okay.
that it?
cop car, y'all.
just trying to get some freebies.
I don't do no cops...
Hello, ma'am.
martin Hart, Rustin Cohle- State CID.
this your place?
it's my lease.
what is this, some kind of hillbilly bunny ranch?
excuse me?
you might want to talk to Sheriff Bilson 'fore you start tossin' accusations around.
no, I ain't got nothing against hillbillies.
relax. That's not why we're here. We, uh, well, something happened to a girl, and we need to know if any of you knew her.
Yeah. That's Dori.
somethin' happened?
you know about that woman found outside of Erath?
Oh, no.
did something happen to Dori?
were you pretty good friends with her?
she was nice to me when I first came around.
gave me tips and stuff.
tips? About what?
nothin'.
you know, just how to be.
you got any idea where she might have been staying the last few weeks?
I don't.
her ex is in prison.
I guess maybe she got a new place.
she'd been going to church.
I was hoping maybe she just turned things around.
we're gonna need to question any girls might have known her.
that's a tougher ask than you think.
folks'll be stayin' away, they hear y'all are out here.
well, ma'am, it's the best way to get us to leave.
you said she left a bag.
Yeah. Can I see it?
sure.
that girl's not 18.
the sheriff know you got underage working here?
what do you know about where that girl's been, where she come from?
you want to know Beth's situation, 'fore she ran out on her uncle?
there are other places she could go.
such holy bullshit from you.
it's a woman's body, ain't it? A woman's choice.
well, she don't look like a woman to me.
at that age, she is not equipped to make those kind of choices.
but I guess you don't give a shit what kind of damage she's doing to herself, as long as you're making your money.
girls walk this Earth all the time screwin' for free.
now, why is it you add business to the mix, and boys like you can't stand the thought?
I'll tell you.
it's 'cause suddenly you don't own it the way you thought you did.
Ahem.
ma'am, you've both been very helpful.
we'll be in touch.
Yes, thank you for your help.
do something else.
that a down payment?
is shitting on any moment of decency part of your job description?
I closed my eyes and saw the king in yellow moving through the forest.
this is her diary, Marty.
believe this shit.
a girl that young.
you know the sheriff has got a stake in this place, too.
fucking Christ.
the king's children were marked.
they became his angels.
the yellow king, Carcosa.
nut job.
fried her brain on whatever she was on.
sounds like she didn't have much to begin with.
well, it reads like a fantasy.
what if he was dosing her regular, and over a period of time, upping the dose little by little without her knowing it?
we should stay out here today, check around for johns maybe knew her.
look at this.
Oh, yeah. Man, a lot of these type places.
expect the flock to canvass for 'em.
you know, we should go there.
could be the church everyone mentioned.
well, let's check around for johns while we're out here and pick up the church on Monday.
most of your stuff's still redacted.
now, what's Northshore?
Northshore Psychiatric Hospital, Lubbock, Texas.
I spent 4 months there in '93.
you feel like talking about that? - Well, sure.
who gives a shit?
Sofia... my daughter.
she was on her tricycle in our driveway. Um...
we lived down a- where a little bend in the road, and...
they said that...
anyway, afterwards, uh,
Claire and I turned on each other, you know?
we... we resented each other being alive, you know?
I transferred from robbery to narco.
started hitting it, you know, 24/7.
street rips, knocking down doors, and within 3 months
I was ripping off couriers or ending up in a Ramada Inn with a couple of fuckin' eight-balls.
Oh, yeah.
somewhere in there, Claire left, and somewhere in there,
I emptied a 9 into a crankhead for injecting his infant daughter with crystal.
said he was trying to purify her.
state attorney gave me one chance to stay out of jail.
he said, "You can keep your profile, but we want to make you our wild man junkie.
so they did. They made me a floater, like a trick.
you know, any agency or department needed a deep undercover narco, they got me, and there was no fuckin' expiration date, baby.
and they kept you out there for 4 years?
and then, February of '93,
I killed 3 cartel men in Port Houston.
I took three 25s in the side and ended up at Northshore Psychiatric Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, which is kind of funny in its own rite
psych ward being in Lubbock, Texas. Heh!
you ever been there? They offered me a psych pension.
jackpot, right?
and I said no.
I said, "Put me on homicide somewhere.
by then, I was owed quite a few favors, and, uh, Louisiana was what they had.
Yeah, for a long time after, I- I didn't really sleep.
nightmares, PTSD, exhausted nerves, whatever.
Yeah.
why homicide?
Oh, something I saw at Northshore.
quote from Corinthians.
the body is not one member, but many.
now are they many, but... of one body.
what's that mean, though?
I was just trying to stay a part of the body now. Heh!
the fishing pole's not working.
just ask Grandpa. - No.
Yeah. - Grandpa, I can't tell if it's working.
you'll know, honey. It'll yank at you hard.
okay. - Why don't you...
how's that case going? The big one?
working it, you know.
things like that didn't happen these parts when I was young.
people said "ma'am" and "sir."
families stayed together.
Yeah, that's how it was, huh?
not all the time.
there was more dignity.
everyone wasn't out in the street, yelling about their rights.
well, if things were so great, they never would have changed.
nothing is going on. I'm just saying, if there's a problem, you can talk to me. You know that.
if I have a problem with someone, I talk to them, Ma.
well, you should be able to talk to me.
I know what it's like to be married to a man.
you think they're all the same, huh?
I don't know why you're so rude to me.
if you're frustrated, don't take it out on me.
I think that you need to get your cable fixed and stop confusing me with your soap operas.
well, you beat up on what you can't control.
makes it bad for everybody else.
I don't know how. - I don't care. Just try.
you do it. - I can't.
you have smaller fingers. Macie, just do it.
so you're telling me the world isn't getting worse?
I seen kids today, all in black, wearing makeup, shit on their faces.
everything's sex.
you know, throughout history,
I bet every old man probably said the same thing.
and old men die, and the world keeps spinning.
how are the girls? - I got this lead
I got this lead I wanted to check up on.
I told you about it.
maybe your dad could bring you back. - No.
you didn't tell me anything about it.
this is a family day.
I did tell you about it.
I mentioned it. It's the new case.
okay, well, how about we all head back, then?
hmm. All right, sweetheart.
come on! Let's go!
my line's tangled. Just paddle in.
okay. Told you!
thanks for the lovely afternoon.
thank you.
afternoon, sir.
how you doing today, Officer? - I have a question for you.
you ever seen this girl? You never seen her before?
never before. - Hm-mmm, not here.
question.
I'm looking for this young lady. You recognize her?
I might need a memory jog.
Dora. Young blonde?
have any guys come around lately, looking for anything more than a good time?
you might be able to remember for a little more money?
I might.
you might?
years we've been through this.
sweetheart, listen to me.
there is nowhere else I want to be.
I wonder if you even know you're lying. Oh, come on!
bad enough, the shit I got to wade through on a daily basis, bring me this "feel bad for me" crap when I work 30 hours straight and spent the weekend listening to your dad's bullshit?
I come home, the one place where there's supposed to be peace and calm, - and you throw this shit- - Who told you that?
it's not always that way. It's not supposed to be.
it's supposed to be what I want, it's supposed to help me.
we do help you!
all the goddamn time!
okay, well, what do you want me to say?
you want me to talk about the woman, had antlers?
do you want me to tell you about the kids disappearing, and maybe you'll stop with the "poor me" little whiny bullshit?
is that what you're saying, hmm?
that I'm trying to make you feel bad for me?
is that really how you want to play this?
no, honey.
I think you're the greatest woman I ever met, and you're the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
but, yeah, you know, sometimes
I think you might have a penchant for self-pity.
and right now, I need you to be strong so that I can do my job.
you have developed some sort of selective deafness.
you used to not be such a chicken shit, I swear.
even your mom thinks you're a ball-buster.
tell the girls dinner.
you don't have a mommy or daddy anymore.
yours just died in an accident.
how?
in a car accident. Someone
dinnertime, kids. Go to the kitchen.
are you coming?
Yeah, of course. I'm starving.
Really?
Yeah, really. - Good.
you know how I think about my daughter now?
you know what...
what she was spared?
sometimes I feel grateful.
doctors said she didn't feel a thing.
went straight into a coma, and then, somewhere in that...
blackness, she slipped off into another, deeper kind.
isn't that a beautiful way to go out? Heh!
painlessly, as a happy child.
Yeah, trouble with...
dying later is you've already grown up.
heh! Damage is done. It's too late.
you got kids?
well, you got the hubris it must take to...
yank a soul out of nonexistence into this meat.
and to force a life into this thresher.
and as for my daughter, she, uh...
she spared me the sin of being a father.
Hey, Cathleen, you little vixen.
any chance of some coffee?
of course. - Okay.
who are these guys?
some assholes Quesada brought in. Coffee on its way.
Hey, morning, Marty. - Hey.
major's introducing me. New flying squad.
you know Mark Daughtry, Ted Bertrand.
what's up?
we've been tasked with investigating crimes with possible occult links.
there's been a rash of animal mutilations, cemeteries defiled.
and they want to see what we have on the Lange case. - Uh-huh.
well, this task force is important to the Commander and to the Governor's Office.
you know, a lot of people are concerned about it.
you know, me, I don't see the connection between two dead cats and a murdered woman.
but then, I'm from Texas.
we're not stepping on your toes, Marty.
we just got the mandate. We got to compare notes with what you got.
Yeah.
here you are, Detective. - No. Oh.
Thanks, Cathleen. - You got it.
xerox all you want.
make you feel like good cops.
you two, my office.
Cohle, we got a new rule around here, especially for you.
you got an opinion about anything, you hold on to it.
you hold on to it or you tell it to Marty.
otherwise, button your big, fat mouth.
however smart you are, you're not as smart as you think.
be serious, boss.
this God-bothering shit.
it's a political circle-jerk. You know this.
is this a place you live?
where are you, huh?
you had anything in the last weeks? You got a suspect?
give us some more guys to follow up KAs, track records.
no, our bosses don't want you at all, you understand?
I don't want you.
you are upright only by the grace of this man's reputation.
goddamn, Cohle.
how many ways are there for me to say, "Shut the fuck up"?
I mean, we work under command, right?
now, our betters want a public, high-profile show of response.
shit, I got a state senator, he's trying to label Satanic graffiti as a hate crime.
that has nothing to do with our DB, and that's the fact of it.
okay, okay. Fine.
let's say that's true, all right?
let's say that you guys get the case all to yourselves.
you ever solve a murder, been in the red more than a week?
you ever clear one where two rounds of questions didn't hand you the fucking answer?
Oh, come on- - No, no, you got leads, you got a timeline.
you know what I got? I got a whodunit where my two detectives are stalling, and I got a brand-new task force wants to take it off our hands.
we have a lead
Oh, for Christ's sake. Fuck off, Cohle.
Christ.
it's your call.
you want to dump this one off? You know, I'd think about it, given the spotlight.
you know, Teddy Bertrand's a good detective. You know him.
well, you're a smart-ass with your mouth shut.
I was just gonna say we've got a lead on a church.
our vic was spending a lot of time there.
that's where we were headed. It could be the break we need.
inside, whatever they're putting over you, how much more time could you get us?
right now, it's up for discussion, but, you know, Tuttle's lighting a fire under this.
without a suspect, they're just gonna stop asking questions, Marty, and they're gonna give orders.
that's that.
give us the rest of the month before they lump it into whatever the play is with the task force, yeah?
I'll try.
two weeks, and then you two start catching again.
Yeah.
let's cut to the point.
as the crow flies, y'all are wanting to ask about that big throwdown in the woods, yeah?
eventually, sure. Right now, we're just trying to track the case.
how Cohle worked it, especially.
which indicates you think I'm too thick to realize that y'all are trying to jam somebody up.
you're on to something new.
so Cohle didn't want to give it to the task force.
did you?
no, I did not.
it don't make sense. There is nothing out here.
according to this map, it should be within these few miles.
well- ahem- I guess if it's one of those tent revival places, they move around.
Yeah.
tents usually do.
there's no date on this flyer, which is strange.
something up there.
wait, wait, back up.
are you saying you were hallucinating on the job?
no. I mean, I could always tell what was real or what wasn't, you know.
so when I'd see things, like, man, I'd just- roll with it.
you still see things?
no.
no, they stopped altogether after I was clean a couple years.
no numbers on this place.
fire must have happened a long time ago.
okay. Place is trashed.
this ain't no kinda anything.
Yeah, back then, the visions.
Yeah, most of the time, I was convinced that I'd lost it.
but there were other times...
I thought I was mainlining the secret truth of the universe.
in the future,
a computer program called Sky Net
will declare war on the human race.
machines have traveled back in time,
taking human form to terminate John Connors,
the future leader of the resistance;
Sarah Connors, John's mother, teacher, and protector;
cameron, a terminator reprogrammed
to defend them at all costs;
Derek Reese, John's uncle,
and the commanding officer with the resistance.
together they fight to stop sky Net from ever being created.
the battle for our tomorrow starts today.
earth to Cameron.
what?
are you okay?
cause if you're gonna try and kill me again,
I wouldn't mind a head start.
if I was going to try to kill you again,
we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Yeah, fair enough.
listen, I'm gonna go get some stuff from Radio World.
I'll meet you back here in a half hour.
30 minutes, I swear.
get me some of those cheese things, all right?
the crunchy ones, not the puffy ones.
I'm sorry to bother you.
it's just...I'm having these weird pains.
what kind of pains?
just like a spicy taco kind of pain,
but I haven't eaten any spicy tacos.
Oh...and I'm bleeding!
we need to take you to the hospital.
Thanks.
miss?
are you all right?
someone get the manager
you been drinking?
taking drugs?
you got a wallet or some kind of I.D. on you?
what's your name?
my name?
why should I tell you?
if you don't, we'll give you one.
go ahead. I'm dying to hear it.
Alison!
Alison Young!
so what are you in for?
I was in a store...
and I couldn't remember anything.
blackouts. Been there, done that.
can tattoos disappear?
sure.
got two of my ex's layers off.
Ryan was...right here.
and Jose...ha... was here.
next time I'm thinking henna.
Henna?
I'm Jody.
I'm...
Alison.
placenta's still attached.
there's no preview.
no evidence of major abruption.
so everything's fine.
I wanna run a Kleihauer-Betke
to rule out fetal blood cells.
what does that mean?
we wanna make sure that the blood is yours
and not the baby's.
what if it is the baby's?
then we do an emergency cesarean.
but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
that didn't sound good.
no, it didn't.
Hey, look, I know you're busy, so...
if you need to go...
can I call someone?
you mean like the father?
I'll be fine. Go.
what happened here?
some girl totally wigged out.
what do you mean, wigged out?
she's on drugs or something.
she couldn't even remember her own name.
What'd she look like?
wanna guess like 16, 17,
brown hair, maybe like 5'8
where is she now?
cops took her.
store owner's not pressing charges.
I don't wanna see you back here.
and you...I'm sick of you.
this is your last get out of jail free.
Hey, where you headed?
I don't know. Good.
why good?
cause you're comin' with me.
Hey, uh, I'm looking for my sister.
she was picked up at the food mart on Gan Nuys.
Yeah, that one.
we released her about an hour ago.
did she say where she was going?
I'm sorry, but I really need to find her, okay?
she's on medication. My mom's gonna kill me.
she might kill her, actually.
she left with one of the street kids, Jody.
do you know where Jody hangs out?
usually gets popped along the boulevard,
all right, thanks.
it's a boy, you know.
boy's good.
I hate being trapped in bed...
feeling like there's nothing I can do.
if you can't protect them when they're still inside you,
how can you ever protect them?
what was yours like? When John was born.
I was, um, living in central America at the time.
we were hiking in the jungle when my water broke.
tried to get to the nearest town, but there wasn't time.
did you have anything for the pain?
and John's father?
he was right there with me.
I remember holding his hand really tight.
gosh, how did you finally get out of there?
hitched a ride on a chicken bus.
tobacco farmer handed out cigars.
we smoked and then sang this birthday song.
Oh, sing a little bit for me.
my spanish is rusty
and I've never been able to sing.
so?
Kacy?
heard you were here.
I was worried. Is everything, uh...
we're waiting on some test results.
I'm Trevor.
Sarah.
I should go.
unless you need something else.
maybe some magazines?
you know Jody? A girl named Jody?
Hey, you know a girl named Jody?
you know a Jody? You know Jody?
Hey, do you know a girl named Jody?
Hey, you know someone named jody?
Hey. Just checking in.
what are you doing?
uh, nothing. Cameron and I are shopping.
what are you doing?
I took Kacy to the hospital.
is she okay?
they're running a few tests.
I'm gonna be a while.
how long? I don't know. Why?
delicious!
who was that?
nobody. I gotta go.
thank you for taking the time to see me.
I understand your reluctance
to discuss these things over the phone.
but I'm pleased you're still considering my job offer.
I am. Thank you.
I appreciate a man who's calm and careful in his decision making.
the last time I went hunting
for these things you want me to hunt, 20 other people died.
I won't let that happen again.
nor should you.
these things...
they're evil.
we have to be careful, agent,
not to anthropomorphize a machine.
these are more than machines, Miss Weaver.
but I'll never make the mistake of thinking they're human.
two years ago,
my husband and I were in a helicopter accident.
he was killed.
I'm sorry. He was flying us to Barstow.
there was a microchip plant there doing some amazing things.
so your husband was a pilot.
he had over 700 hours on that particular helicopter.
it was his passion.
this is difficult for you.
the Kulishov a-85 is a beautiful flying machine.
like the most perfect bird.
it's almost flawless in its design.
almost flawless?
it needs a human to fly it.
are you saying that...
machines make better decisions than humans?
what I think
is that in certain extreme conditions,
even the most calm and careful of men panic.
help me find this machine, agent.
you and I'll take it apart piece by piece.
I'm not sure what we'll find,
but I doubt we'll find evil.
so much food.
I know. We're totally puking later.
but whatever.
it's an occasion.
I like your necklace.
it's cool, huh?
I got it from this awesome thrift store in echo park.
so...
two years ago, when I moved here from Michigan,
I had this internship at a storefront in Chinatown.
the designer was this total druggie.
and when I finally called him out
on what stuck up and talentless bitch he was,
I got fired from my unpaid job.
that's when I started crashing with people
and doing, you know, whatever for money
which got sketchy real quick.
especially in L.A.
the city is like a freak magnet.
you'd look really pretty in this.
we should bounce.
how much you get for it, you crazy bitch?
I don't know what you're talking about.
my laptop, the one with all the stuff on it?
I didn't take your laptop, dude. Weird.
it just disappeared the same day you left.
Hey, look
who are you, huh?
you a little thief too?
huh?
just take it. Go!
please just go!
next time I see you, you'd better hide me or something.
all I'm saying is sometimes
you gotta take a punch once in a while
in order to keep the cash-- that was a lot of cash.
I'm sorry.
well, fill it out
so we can crash here for a couple of nights.
I don't know what to write.
doesn't matter. Lie.
the other catch is
you have to have this interview with a counselor.
just b. s. your way through it.
don't tell them anything real.
nice.
I don't know.
you weren't, like...
getting beaten up or anything, were you?
sorry about that thing I said earlier about taking a punch.
if you've gotten your fill, I shouldn't have said it.
but don't worry.
from now on... I got your back.
wasn't easy getting that shot.
where was it?
tanzania.
paul and I just got back a couple weeks ago.
but you didn't come here to talk about zebras.
I was hoping you could run a check on someone for me--off the record.
who is it?
Catherine Weaver. Zeira corp.
what's your interest in her?
actually, she's interested in me.
she offered me a job.
you're leaving the bureau?
it's just an offer, Lila.
you're not wearing your cross.
how do you know?
the way you're carrying yourself.
what happened in north Hollywood...
that wasn't your fault.
agent Ellison?
got those updated 302s for you.
thank you, Liz.
glad you kept the name.
it's a good name.
where are you from， Alison?
I don't remember.
where are you from, Alison?
I don't remember.
you don't remember what town you're from?
why does it matter?
it's not there anymore.
you know, sometimes when people forget,
it's because they need to forget...
because something painful has happened.
I'm wondering if something has happened to you.
tell me about your life.
I live in a tunnel.
I eat garbage for dinner.
anything you say in here is confidential.
the only exception is
is if you were planning to harm someone...
I would have to report that.
I would never hurt anyone.
tell me about your family.
memory is a very associative thing.
sometimes sights,
sounds, even a smell can take us back.
my father was an architect.
he taught me how to draw.
my mother was music teacher.
she'd sit for hours
and listen to Chopin.
what's that bracelet on your arm?
my sister gave it to me for my birthday.
july 22nd...
I had a party in Griffith Park.
all my friends were there.
I saw a boy ride by on his silver mountain bike,
and I told my dad...
that's what I want.
and he said next year.
but I didn't have a party the next year.
no one did.
why not?
everyone was dead.
why not？
it's a balinese tiger.
have you ever seen a real one?
Unfortately, they were hunted to extinction in the 30's.
do you ever think that could happen to us?
to humans?
is that something you worry about?
I wanna go home.
Where's home?
Palmdale.
Palmdale?
that's where I'm from.
Hey, do you know a Jody, by any chance?
Jody? do you know a Jody?
anybody here know a Jody? -Yeah, yeah, I know her.
Yeah, she was here earlier with some other chick.
do you know where she went?
no. But she hangs out at this halfway house sometimes on Yucca.
Yucca. Thanks.
hungry?
split my jell-o with you.
Where's Trevor?
he went to go get me some real food.
he's the baby daddy.
in case you didn't figure that out.
you never mentioned him.
we've been on and off.
he freaked when I got pregnant.
but...now he's here.
I don't know.
just...I just want life to be perfect for him, you know?
didn't you feel that way?
do not get me wrong. I'm not an idiot.
I know it'll never be perfect.
it's just...
right now... in there...
no one's ever made fun of him,
turned him down for a date.
how long does he have, really, until he figures out how hard it can all be?
mom?
it's me, Alison.
I'm sorry. You must have the wrong number.
Mrs. Young?
Yes. This is Claire Young.
I'm here with your daughter.
there must be some mistake. I don't have a daughter.
not yet.
very pretty name, though, Alison.
she didn't even know who I was.
parents suck.
especially mothers.
why would she do that to me?
who knows why anyone does anything?
come on
let's go have some fun.
Ah, ah. Sit.
eat. I insist.
thank you.
you like tri-tip?
I grill a mean tri-tip. We could do a barbecue.
with you and the kids.
Uh...John and-- what's the girl's name again?
Cameron.
can't wait to meet 'em.
if you want, I can take John to the ran with me sometime.
he's not much of a golfer.
me neither. Guns.
Trevor's a cop.
detective.
L.A. p. d.
we got the results.
cells were all maternal. The baby's fine.
we need to keep you overnight for observation,
but you can go home tomorrow.
I knew it.
he's a fighter, this kid.
just like his mama.
no criminal history.
no pending scc investigations.
nothing from finance. Her ctrs all check out.
not even a civil suit.
that's good to know.
James, before you make such a huge change,
don't you think maybe you should talk to someone?
marshal Weaver's helicopter crash
was due to mechanical failure?
you're not listening to me.
I talked to a couple of people.
it's possible you're suffering from
what people? Paul?
he served in the Persian Gulf.
he's got experience with this kind of thing.
I came to you in confidence.
I'm worried about you, James.
I've never seen you in so much pain.
Yeah, we both know that's not true.
thank you for the report.
I'm gonna go get soda.
what the hell are you doing?
playing football.
we've gotta go.
go where?
home.
home? who are you?
Cameron...
my name's Alison.
no, it's not. It's Cameron.
I can't explain this to you right now.
we have to go before mom gets home.
you're freaking me out.
I'm freaking you out?
you really not know who you are?
I'm Alison. From Palmdale.
you're not Alison. You're not from Palmdale.
you're from the future. You're a machine.
a what?
the chip is messed up again, but I can fix you.
I fixed you once, remember?
fixed me?
why would you fix me?
help! Help us!
come on, we have to get out of here.
what did you do? Did you hurt me?
is there a problem?
no. I'm her brother. John Baum.
I don't have a brother.
look, dude, I don't know who you are,
but you really
sir, you need to leave.
you shouldn't have run.
you're just making things worse for yourself.
your hair.
it's so pretty.
we work very hard on the hair
to get it right.
I'm not your enemy.
right.
I want to get to know you.
you're very brave.
that must be why John Connor chose you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I admire him, his determination.
his spirit, his fearlessness.
I'd like to meet him.
he wouldn't want to meet you.
they're going to kill you.
they're going to kill every one of you.
they'll hunt you down
until every human is gone,
and you're extinct.
then...
why are we having this conversation?
because some of us don't want that.
some of us want peace.
you were chosen, Alison, not just by John Connor,
by us.
tell me where his camp is.
I think...
I'm a machine.
a machine.
what kind of machine?
from the future.
what do you do in the future?
I'm an infiltrator.
what do you infiltrate?
the human resistance.
I see. Why?
it's what I was programmed for.
programmed.
to find John Connor.
Why's he so important?
he's the one who saves mankind.
saves them. From what?
extinction.
and what are you gonna do when you find John Connor?
I'm going to kill him
and hang his head on a pike for all to see.
your hair.
it's so pretty.
Thanks.
tell me about your life.
Why?
I want to get to know you.
I don't really like talking about my past.
I came from L.A. to start over.
did you?
Yeah. Burned a lot of bridges here, though.
keep thinking I'm gonna go someplace more authentic,
you know, like Portland.
I could come with you.
we could reinvent ourselves.
we could.
So...who are you, really?
I've never heard of you.
suddenly you're Kacy's best friend.
I'm just a neighbor.
sorry. Cop brain.
stresses her, you know.
my job.
you'd think having a cop around
would make her feel safe.
she's afraid it'll follow me back home.
does it?
I can protect her.
it's your family, right?
you do what it takes.
sorry.
Yeah.
right.
there was a robbery homicide downtown.
I'm gonna have to take off.
what about tomorrow? she's gonna need a ride.
I'll be here.
I just...I hate for her to spend the night alone.
agent Ellison. Come in.
this is my daughter Savannah.
Savannah.
Sudoku.
I used to love these.
you have children, agent Ellison?
Um...no.
do you want them?
I did...once.
very much.
but my wife--um, well, my ex-wife...
wasn't meant to be.
Bye, Savannah.
your husband's helicopter crash.
I read the official report.
the ntsb concluded
that mechanical failure was to blame.
mechanical failure. Correct.
that's not what you led me to believe the other day.
correct.
which is it?
what's the truth?
you tell me.
I think...
what people write in reports...
when it's official
isn't always true.
I think if I had a child,
one that I knew would grow up asking
what happened to her daddy...
I think I would make sure that answer,
the official answer,
was the one I would want her to hear.
I think you saw what you saw.
just as you saw what you saw.
when can I start?
I used to babysit for this family five years ago.
they were loaded.
you said you moved here two years ago from Michigan.
they usually hide a key here somewhere.
sweet! You are jacked, girl.
look for cash and jewelry.
check this out.
saw the lady open it.
I memorized the...
combination.
just put it all in the bag.
what are these?
whatever. Just put 'em back.
they're the same as the necklace you gave me.
because I stole it when I worked here.
you said, "I got it at this awesome thrift store"
in echo park.
tell me about the necklace.
why are you making such a big deal out of this?
tell me about the necklace.
I didn't buy it or steal it, okay?
it's mine.
this is... my parents' house.
you lied to me.
I told you where the camp was.
you told me your sister gave you that bracelet.
what does that have to do with anything?
we found these on some of your friends.
why are you all wearing them?
it has something to do with the Connor camp.-No.
it's a pass.
to get into the camp.
you were going to send me there without it.
they would have known what I was.
you lied to me.
I'll never help you get to John Connor.
you already did.
you.
I'm from L.A. okay?
let's go.
tell me who you are.
I went to Cal Arts for two years,
and I got kicked out, which was for the best,
because that place is a... factory.
and my parents cut me off like yours,
and just pretend I don't exist.
we have to go. Now.
Why?
because there's a silent alarm, and we tripped it when we walked in.
you weren't going to tell me.
the police are gonna be here any second.
you were never going to Portland.
you were gonna run
and leave me here to take the blame.
no.
you lied to me.
you lied to me.
I'll never help you get to John Connor.
no, no, no. What did you do?
what did you do?
we have to go.
John.
we have to go.
did you kill her?
apparently not.
Where's Trevor?
he was called into work.
be back tomorrow to take you home.
what's wrong?
it wasn't him that freaked out.
it was me.
when I found out I was pregnant.
cop thing. He told me.
Yeah. cop thing.
it's kind of cool and sexy
when you're a 25-year-old pastry chef
making gourmet doughnuts
at this hip cop hang out in Silver Lake.
when you think about breast-feeding your baby boy
next to the walkie and the 9 millimeter...
still...
he's a good man.
he'll be a good dad.
Kacy, I have to tell you something.
that story about John's birth,
it wasn't true.
the jungle?
no, that part was true.
the part about his father wasn't.
he wasn't there with me.
he died before John was born.
before I even knew I was pregnant.
why did you tell me that story?
cause I wished it's the way it could have been.
that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
the thing is, I got through it.
all of it. By myself.
and so can you.
besides, you won't be alone.
I'll be right next door.
that was my last get out of jail free.
damn right.
Where'd you get that?
I got it at this awesome thrift store in Echo Park.
in the future, a computer program called skynet will declare war on the human race.
machines have traveled back in time, taking human form to terminate john connor, the future leader of the resistance;
Sarah connor, john's mother, teacher, and protector;
cameron, a terminator reprogrammed to defend them at all costs;
Derek reese, john's uncle, and the commanding officer with the resistance.
together they fight to stop skynet from ever being created.
the battle for our tomorrow starts today.
earth to cameron.
what?
are you okay?
cause if you're gonna try and kill me again, I wouldn't mind a head start.
if I was going to try to kill you again, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Yeah, fair enough. Listen, I'm gonna go get some stuff from radio world.
I'll meet you back here in a half hour.
30 minutes, I swear.
get me some of those cheese things, all right?
the crunchy ones, not the puffy ones.
I'm sorry to bother you. It's just...
I'm having these weird pains.
what kind of pains?
just like a spicy taco kind of pain, but I haven't eaten any spicy tacos.
and I'm bleeding!
we need to take you to the hospital.
Thanks.
miss? Are you all right?
someone get the manager you been drinkin'? Taking drugs?
you got a wallet or some kind of I. D.On you?
what's your name?
my name?
why should I tell you?
if you don't, we'll give you one.
go ahead. I'm dying to hear it.
so what are you in for?
I was in a store...
and I couldn't remember anything.
blackouts.
been there, done that.
can tattoos disappear?
sure. Got two of my ex's lasered off.
Ryan was... right here.
and jose... was here.
next time I'm thinking henna.
I'm jody.
I'm... alison.
placenta's still attached.
there's no previa.
no evidence of major abruption.
so everything's fine.
I wanna run a kleihauer-betke to rule out fetal blood cells.
what does that mean?
we wanna make sure that the blood is yours and not the baby'S.
what if it is the baby's?
then we do an emergency c-section.
but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
that didn't sound good.
no, it didn'T.
Hey, look, I know you're busy, so...
if you need to go...
can I call someone?
you mean like the father?
I'll be fine. Go.
what happened here?
some girl totally wigged out.
what do you mean, wigged out?
she's on drugs or something.
she couldn't even remember her own name.
What'd she look like?
wanna guess like 16, 17, brown hair, maybe like 5'8
where is she now?
cops took her.
store owner's not pressing charges.
I don't wanna see you back here.
and you... I'm sick of you.
this is your last get out of jail free.
Hey, where you headed?
I don't know. - Good.
why good?
cause you're comin' with me.
Hey, uh, I'm looking for my sister.
she was picked up at the food mart on van nuys.
Yeah, that one.
we released her about an hour ago.
did she say where she was going?
I'm sorry, but I really need to find her, okay? She's on medication.
my mom's gonna kill me.
she might kill her, actually.
she left with one of the street kids, jody.
do you know where jody hangs out?
usually gets popped along the boulevard, near highland.
all right, thanks.
it's a boy, you know.
boy's good.
I hate being trapped in bed...
feeling like there's nothing I can do.
if you can't protect them when they're still inside you, how can you ever protect them?
what was yours like?
when john was born.
I was, um, living in central america at the time.
we were hiking in the jungle when my water broke.
tried to get to the nearest town, but there wasn't time.
did you have anything for the pain?
bottle of dark rum.
and john's father?
he was right there with me.
I remember holding his hand really tight.
gosh, how did you finally get out of there?
hitched a ride on a chicken bus.
tobacco farmer handed out cigars.
we smoked and then sang this birthday song.
Oh, sing a little bit for me.
my spanish is rusty and I've never been able to sing.
so?
heard you were here.
I was worried. Is everything, uh...
we're waiting on some test results.
I'm trevor. - Sarah.
I should go.
unless you need something else.
maybe some magazines?
you know jody? A girl named jody?
Hey, you know a girl named jody?
you know a jody? You know jody?
Hey, do you know a girl named jody?
Hey, you know someone named jody?
just checking in. What are you doing?
uh, nothing. Cameron and I are shopping. What are you doing?
I took kacy to the hospital.
is she okay?
they're running a few tests. I'm gonna be a while.
how long?
I don't know. Why?
delicious! - Who was that?
nobody. I gotta go.
thank you for taking the time to see me.
I understand your reluctance to discuss these things over the phone.
but I'm pleased you're still considering my job offer.
I am. Thank you.
I appreciate a man who's calm and careful in his decision making.
the last time I went hunting for these things you want me to hunt, 20 other people died.
I won't let that happen again.
nor should you.
these things... they're evil.
we have to be careful, agent, not to anthropomorphize a machine.
these are more than machines, miss weaver.
but I'll never make the mistake of thinking they're human.
two years ago, my husband and I were in a helicopter accident.
he was killed.
I'm sorry.
he was flying us to barstow.
there was a microchip plant there doing some amazing things.
so your husband was a pilot.
he had over 700 hours on that particular helicopter.
it was his passion.
this is difficult for you.
the kulishov a-85 is a beautiful flying machine.
like the most perfect bird.
it's almost flawless in its design.
almost flawless?
it needs a human to fly it.
are you saying that...
machines make better decisions than humans?
what I think is that in certain extreme conditions, even the most calm and careful of men panic.
help me find this machine, agent.
you and I'll take it apart piece by piece.
I'm not sure what wll find, but I doubt we'll find evil.
so much food.
I know. We're totally puking later. But whatever.
it's an occasion.
I like your necklace.
it's cool, huh? I got it from this awesome thrift store in echo park.
so...
two years ago, when I moved here from michigan,
I had this internship at a storefront in chinatown.
the designer was this total druggie.
and when I finally called him out on what stuck up and talentless bitch he was,
I got fired from my unpaid job.
that's when I started crashing with people and doing, you know, whatever...
for money...
which got sketchy real quick.
especially in L. A. The city is like a freak magnet.
you'd look really pretty in this.
we should bounce.
how much you get for it, you crazy bitch?
I don't know what you're talking about.
my laptop, the one with all the stuff on it? - I didn't take your laptop, dude.
weird. It just disappeared the same day you left.
Hey, look
who are you, huh? You a little thief too?
just take it. Go!
please just go!
next time I see you, you better have me something!
all I'm saying is sometimes you gotta take a punch once in a while in order to keep the cash
that was a lot of cash.
I'm sorry.
well, fill it out so we can crash here for a couple of nights.
I don't know what to write.
doesn't matter. Lie.
the other catch is you have to have this interview with a counselor.
just B. S.Your way through it. Don't tell them anything real.
nice.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
I don't know.
you weren't, like...
getting beaten up or anything, were you?
sorry about that thing I said earlier about taking a punch.
if you've gotten your fill, I shouldn't have said it.
but don't worry.
from now on... I got your back.
wasn't easy getting that shot.
where was it?
tanzania.
paul and I just got back a couple weeks ago.
but you didn't come here to talk about zebras.
I was hoping you could run a check on someone for me-- off the record.
who is it?
Catherine weaver. Zeira corp.
what's your interest in her?
actually, she's interested in me.
she offered me a job.
you're leaving the bureau?
it's just an offer, lila.
you're not wearing your cross.
how do you know?
the way you're carrying yourself.
what happened in north hollywood...
that wasn't your fault.
agent ellison?
got those updated 302s for you.
thank you, liz.
glad you kept the name.
it's a good name.
where are you from, alison?
I don't remember.
where are you from, alison?
I don't remember.
you don't remember what town you're from?
why does it matter?
it's not there anymore.
you know, sometimes when people forget, it's because they need to forget...
because something painful has happened.
I'm wondering if something has happened to you.
tell me about your life.
I live in a tunnel.
I eat garbage for dinner.
anything you say in here is confidential.
the only exception is is if you were planning to harm someone...
I would have to report that.
I would never hurt anyone.
tell me about your family.
memory is a very associative thing.
sometimes sights, sounds, even a smell can take us back.
my father was an architect.
he taught me how to draw.
my mother was a music teacher.
she'd sit for hours and listen to chopin.
what's that bracelet on your arm?
my sister gave it to me for my birthday.
july 22nd...
I had a party in griffith park.
all my friends were there.
I saw a boy ride by on his silver mountain bike, and I told my dad...that's what I want.
and he said next year.
but I didn't have a party the next year. No one did.
why not?
everyone was dead.
why not?
it's a balinese tiger.
have you ever seen a real one?
unfortunately, they were hunted to extinction in the '30s.
do you ever think that could happen to us?
to humans?
is that something you worry about?
I wanna go home.
Where's home?
Palmdale.
Palmdale?
that's where I'm from.
Hey, do you know a jody, by any chance?
Jody? Do you know a jody?
anybody here know a jody?
Yeah, yeah, I know her.
Yeah, she was here earlier with some other chick.
do you know where she went? - No.
but she hangs out at this halfway house sometimes on yucca.
Yucca. Thanks.
hungry?
split my jell-o with you.
Where's trevor?
he went to go get me some real food.
he's the baby daddy.
in case you didn't figure that out.
you never mentioned him.
we've been on and off.
he freaked when I got pregnant.
but... now he's here. I don't know.
just...
I just want life to be perfect for him, you know?
didn't you feel that way?
don't get me wrong. I'm not an idiot. I know it'll never be perfect.
it's just... right now... in there...
no one's ever made fun of him, turned him down for a date.
how long does he have, really, until he figures out how hard it can all be?
Hello? - Mom?
it's me, alison.
I'm sorry. You must have the wrong number.
Mrs. Young? - Yes. This is claire young.
I'm here with your daughter.
there must be some mistake. I don't have a daughter.
not yet.
very pretty name, though, alison.
she didn't even know who I was.
parents suck.
especially mothers.
why would she do that to me?
who knows why anyone does anything?
come on. Let's go have some fun.
sit. Eat. I insist.
thank you.
you like tri-tip? I grill a mean tri-tip. We could do a barbecue.
with you and the kids.
John and-- what's the girl's name again? - Cameron.
can't wait to meet 'em.
if you want, I can take john to the range with me sometime.
he's not much of a golfer. - Me neither. Guns.
Trevor's a cop.
detective. L. A.P. D.
we got the results.
cells were all maternal. The baby's fine.
we need to keep you overnight for observation, but you can go home tomorrow.
I knew it.
he's a fighter, this kid.
just like his mama.
no criminal history.
no pending scc investigations. Nothing from fincen.
her ctrs all check out. Not even a civil suit.
that's good to know.
James, before you make such a huge change, don't you think maybe you should talk to someone?
marshal weaver's helicopter crash was due to mechanical failure?
you're not listening to me.
I talked to a couple of people.
it's possible you're suffering from-- - what people?
he served in the persian gulf.
he's got experience with this kind of thing.
I came to you in confidence.
I'm worried about you, james.
I've never seen you in so much pain.
Yeah, we both know that's not true.
thank you for the report.
Yes! I'm gonna go get soda.
what the hell are you doing?
playing foosball. - We've gotta go.
go where?
home. - Home? Who are you?
my name's alison.
no, it's not. It's cameron.
I can't explain this to you right now.
we have to go before mom gets home.
you're freaking me out.
I'm freaking you out?
you really not know who you are?
I'm alison. From palmdale.
you're not alison. You're not from palmdale.
you're from the future. You're a machine.
a what?
the chip is messed up again, but I can fix you.
I fixed you once, remember? - Fixed me?
why would you fix me?
come on, we have to get out of here.
what did you do? Did you hurt me?
is there a problem?
no. I'm her brother. John baum.
I don't have a brother.
look, dude, I don't know who you are, but you really
sir, you need to leave.
you shouldn't have run.
you're just making things worse for yourself.
your hair. It's so pretty.
we work very hard on the hair to get it right.
I'm not your enemy. - Right.
I want to get to know you.
you're very brave. That must be why john connor chose you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I admire him, his determination.
his spirit, his fearlessness.
I'd like to meet him.
he wouldn't want to meet you.
they're going to kill you.
they're going to kill every one of you.
they'll hunt you down until every human is gone, and you're extinct.
then...
why are we having this conversation?
because some of us don't want that.
some of us want peace.
you were chosen, alison, not just by john connor, by us.
tell me where his camp is.
I think...
I'm a machine. - a machine.
what kind of machine?
from the future.
what do you do in the future?
I'm an infiltrator.
what do you infiltrate?
the human resistance.
I see. Why?
it's what I was programmed for. - Programmed.
to find john connor.
Why's he so important?
he's the one who saves mankind.
saves them. From... what?
extinction.
and what are you gonna do when you find john connor?
I'm going to kill him and hang his head on a pike for all to see.
your hair. It's so pretty.
Thanks.
tell me about your life.
Why?
I want to get to know you.
I don't really like talking about my past.
I came to L. A. To start over.
did you? - Yeah.
burned a lot of bridges here, though.
keep thinking I'm gonna go someplace more authentic, you know, like portland.
I could come with you.
we could reinvent ourselves.
we could.
so... who are you, really?
I've never heard of you. Suddenly you're kacy's best friend.
I'm just a neighbor.
sorry. Cop brain.
stresses her, you know. My job.
you'd think having a cop around would make her feel safe.
she's afraid it'll follow me back home.
does it?
I can protect her. It's your family, right?
you do what it takes. Sorry.
Yeah. Right.
there was a robberyhomicide downtown.
I'm gonna have to take off.
what about tomorrow? She's gonna need a ride.
I'll be here. I just...
I hate for her to spend the night alone.
agent ellison. Come in.
this is my daughter savannah.
Sudoku. I used to love these.
you have children, agent ellison?
um... no.
do you want them?
I did... once. Very much.
but my wife--um, well, my ex-wife...
wasn't meant to be.
Bye, savannah.
your husband's helicopter crash.
I read the official report.
the ntsb concluded that mechanical failure was to blame.
mechanical failure.
correct.
that's not what you led me to believe the other day.
correct.
which is it? What's the truth?
you tell me.
I think...
what people write in reports...
when it's official isn't always true.
I think if I had a child, one that I knew would grow up asking what happened to her daddy...
I think I would make sure that answer, the official answer, was the one I would want her to hear.
I think you saw what you saw.
just as you saw what you saw.
when can I start?
I used to babysit for this family five years ago.
they were loaded.
you said you moved here two years ago from michigan.
they usually hide a key here somewhere.
sweet! You are jacked, girl.
look for cash and jewelry.
check this out.
saw the lady open it. I memorized the... combination.
just put it all in the bag.
what are these?
whatever. Just put 'em back.
they're the same as the necklace you gave me.
because I stole it when I worked here.
you said, "I got it at this awesome thrift store in echo park.
tell me about the necklace.
why are you making such a big deal out of this?
tell me about the necklace.
I didn't buy it or steal it, okay?
it's mine.
this is... my parents' house.
you lied to me.
I told you where the camp was.
you told me your sister gave you that bracelet.
what does that have to do with anything?
we found these on some of your friends.
why are you all wearing them?
it has something to do with the connor camp. - No.
it's a pass.
to get into the camp.
you were going to send me there without it. They would have known what I was.
you lied to me.
I'll never help you get to john connor.
you already did.
you lied to me.
I'm from L. A. Okay? Let's go.
tell me who you are.
I went to cal arts for two years, and I got kicked out, which was for the best, because that place is A...factory.
and my parents cut me off like yours, and just pretend I don't exist.
we have to go. Now.
Why?
because there's a silent alarm, and we tripped it when we walked in.
you weren't going to tell me.
the police are gonna be here any second.
you were never going to portland.
you were gonna run and leave me here to take the blame.
no.
you lied to me.
you lied to me.
I'll never help you get to john connor.
no, no, no. What did you do? What did you do?
we have to go. John. We have to go.
did you kill her?
apparently not.
Where's trevor?
he was called into work.
be back tomorrow to take you home.
what's wrong?
it wasn't him that freaked out. It was me.
when I found out I was pregnant.
cop thing. He told me.
Yeah. Cop thing.
it's kinda cool and sexy when you're a 25-year-old pastry chef making gourmet doughnuts at this hip cop hangout in silverlake.
when you think about breast-feeding your baby boy next to the walkie and the . 9 millimeter...
still... he's a good man.
hel be a good dad.
Kacy, I have to tell you something.
that story about john's birth, it wasn't true.
the jungle?
no, that part was true.
the part about his father wasn'T.
he wasn't there with me.
he died before john was born.
before I even knew I was pregnant.
why did you tell me that story?
cause I wished it's the way it could have been.
that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
the thing is, I got through it.
all of iT. By myself. And so can you.
besides, you won't be alone. I'll be right next door.
that was my last get out of jail free.
damn right.
Where'd you get that?
I got it at this awesome thrift store in echo park.
I'm here because sarah connor is a diluted,
dangerous, grade a whack-a-mole who killed a man because she believed that in the future he'll invent a computer system
that declares war on the world.
I'm looking for this girl.
have you seen my niece?
there was a guy here looking for your sister.
get rid of him! riley!
if you don't leave, I'm calling the police.
that guy is really dangerous. that's all you need to know.
really dangerous.
this has nothing to do with riley.
you're pissed off
because I found someone I actually like
spending time with, and it's not you.
Riley, look at me.
show me that.
that's horrifying.
Yeah, well, it's supposed to stop cars from playing
ping-pong with your head.
Hey, I think your mom's out here.
Hi, mrs. baum!
thank you so much for having me over.
I didn't even know if you were busy tonight when I texted you.
I'm never busy.
so I should do it again sometime.
or maybe you could call.
you know, with your voice.
maybe I could try that.
maybe you should
see you soon
okay, be safe.
I bought her a helmet.
responsible.
you think it'll stop a bullet?
why, you gonna take a shot at her?
a lot of bullets fly around here.
someone will.
you care about this girl?
Yeah.
then leave her alone.
I'll talk to john.
John's not listening.
he's always listening.
I was going to suggest a safe.
well, you might have suggested it before we got robbed.
where are you going?
I need to restock the supply drop.
we've been using a lot of ammunition.
business has been booming.
Where's john?
still in his room.
he hasn't gotten up yet?
he needs more sleep than you do.
it's because the circadian rhythm of teenagers is abnormal.
how late were you up talking to him?
not late.
he won't be seeing riley anymore.
is that so?
John's not stupid.
I don't like the way he responds to you.
you got what you wanted.
where is he?
check under the bed.
you don't know.
I didn't even know if you were busy when I texted you tonight.
I'm never busy.
so then I guess I should do it again sometime.
or maybe you could even call.
you know, with your voice.
maybe I could try that.
maybe you should.
see you soon.
go, be safe.
I'll talk to john.
John's not listening.
he's always listening.
are you busy?
no.
did you chge?
it's hot out.
since when do you feel heat?
I feel heat.
are you hoping that riley's gonna see us in bed together,
and be totally scarred for the rest of her life or something?
no.
I watched riley leave till I couldn't see her anymore.
and then you and mom high-fived.
you bring danger into riley's life.
I know that.
I'm not stupid.
but sometimes you do stupid things.
it would help me to understand why.
humans do stupid things.
so don't worry about it, and be happy you're a machine.
I'm a machine.
I can't be happy.
but I understand more than you think.
so you understand that I'm going to keep seeing riley,
even if everyone thinks it's a bad idea.
I understand that it's a bad idea.
and I understand that being john connor can be lonely.
Oh, yeah?
how do you understand that?
you and I talk about it a lot.
we do?
we do.
we will.
I need-- I need to get some sleep.
and riley?
I know.
I know.
he won't be seeing riley anymore.
I don't like the way he responds to you.
you got what you wanted.
it's just you.
you been stealing my supplies?
we needed to make a small bomb.
I set this drop up with my people for my people.
and everything's in here for a reason.
John was supposed to ask.
John needs to get his head in the game.
maybe he couldn't find you.
you don't spend much time at the house.
I don't have a bed, remember?
you didn't have a bed in the old house.
I had a gunshot wound at the old house.
Yes. you almost died.
it's not the first time.
who's that?
alarm code from john. he's in trouble.
I need to get some sleep.
and riley?
I know.
I know.
Yeah, right.
I'll be there in a few minutes.
EW, please stop doing that.
look, I got this from my foster parents.
and it's a rape whistle.
it's totally for moments like this.
moments like this? yeah, all right.
when I was a kid, i
I lived in mexico for a year and a half.
in this, uh, little village called dejalo.
and, uh...
that's where we're going.
thought I'd show you around.
um, well, did you run this idea by your mom?
because sometimes I get the impression
that she doesn't really like surprises.
I don't care.
did you guys get in a fight last night?
no.
so this is definitely a field trip,
and not some revenge fantasy?
all right, if you don't wanna go, that's cool.
but do not make me feel like I'm kidnapping you or something.
Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
you just caught me off guard.
I'm really, really happy that you want
to show me where you grew up.
good.
cause I booked the honeymoon suite.
wait, what?
it's good, right?
it's nice to get some space.
you and space.
you know, the first time we talked,
you were sitting by yourself in the grass.
that was space too.
so it was.
you know I used to watch you at school?
when the bell would ring
and those narrow hallways would fill up,
it got so loud, and people would bump into you.
you looked like you could just
jump out the window and run away.
God, you're such a little stalker.
all right, so I get that...
we ran away to get some space.
the only shame is...
we ran all this way, and there's skulls everywhere.
what, you don't like skulls?
I like other things better.
it's for dia de los muertos.
the festival's tonight.
nice.
skulls and darkness, how charming.
doing the best I can.
I never want to leave this room.
wait, I think I see the problem.
would you just get in here? we don't need bubbles.
well, there's bubbles to be had,
and I'm going toave bubules.
Ah, not bad, huh?
you're a total pro.
wait, you didn't live here with your mom, did you?
no.
we, uh
we actually had a cabana on the beach.
I think we had very different childhoods.
it wasn't always good.
sometimes I wish we just stayed here.
away from everybody.
people suck.
not just people.
no, I mean
when you meet someone, you don't
really expect to give a damn about them, right?
who's got the time?
life's too short, and people suck.
I don't like getting attached to people.
so...
why were you living in mexico?
Oh, you're thinking of a lie or a joke.
no, I'm not. -yes, you are.
you have a tell. -I just don't want to sit around
and talk about my messed up childhood.
can't we just enjoy ourselves?
Yeah, fine.
enjoy yourself, john.
I'm sure we're not the only couple
that's found themselves in a honeymoon suite,
and not known the first thing about each other.
you're right.
people suck.
Podemos tener picante, por favor?
el verde?
es muy picante como fuego.
Si, exactamente.
what was that about?
hot sauce.
you know, uh, they do this killer thanksgiving buffet here.
I bet.
see?
I'm telling you all sorts of good stuff.
I'm not trying to be your stalker, I just
I think this is what we should be doing.
you know, getting to know each other.
well, I have a question for you.
you said, uh, that I have a tell.
what is it?
okay, you promise not to obsess over it or anything?
what a handsome couple.
and for only $5,
a photo memory. no, thanks.
see, a beautiful shot.
and it's all digital.
which means I can email it to you.
I--I think I have something in my teeth.
Oh, well, let me take another.
no, no, really, that's okay.
Hey, I said that's okay.
look, man, why don't i, uh
why don't I just give you five bucks,
and you'll delete it.
can you do that?
Gracias, joven.
the young boy and mother
who stayed in vivian's cabana.
thanks a lot.
John connor.
no se de quien estas hablando.
you're sarah connor's son.
I'll be right back.
I remember when the connors left dejalo.
and I remember the stories that were told after you were gone.
man, you really
you really mixed me up with somebody else.
I'm just
these are pictures you wouldn't want the authorities to see.
how much? everything you've got.
Hey, back off, man.
we gotta get out of here, now.
run! no!
no se puede salir sin pagar!
puedo pagar la camara.
stick to english, kid.
the american accent is killing me.
this is a misunderstanding, that's all.
I'll pay for the camera, okay?
what the hell were you doing down here anyway?
we're just tourists.
cancun's not good for you?
this is the guy?
Yes, sir.
I was about to take his statement.
a man took a picture of me and my girlfriend,
and he wanted us to buy it.
it was crowded, someone bumped into him,
he dropped his camera.
I was afraid a fight was going to start,
so we tried to leave, that's all.
how old are you? 16.
you were drinking? no.
you have parents.
my mother and an uncle.
they know where you are?
no.
I'll make you a deal.
if they come pick you up, I'll let you go with a warning.
leave a message.
what the hell was that?
it's my uncle's voice mail.
call your mother.
Hello?
John, thank god. where are you?
I've been going out of my mind.
did you get through?
John, are you there? are you in trouble?
she didn't answer.
put him in holding.
in a few hours, give him another phone call.
and run his name through interpol.
Yes, sir.
so which name should I run?
the one on your passport?
or the real one?
sir, sir, hello?
Hi, can you come here, please?
Hi, I need your help, please.
this guy in here is a complete psycho.
he's been trying to make moves on me.
you two came in together.
sir, do you have children? do you have a daughter?
my dad told me to stay away from this guy,
and he was totally right.
this guy's a complete freak.
and I don't even care how much trouble I'm in.
all I want to do is call home
and tell them where I am.
please?
take a step back.
I'm going to open the door. -thank you
lo siento, senor. lo siento.
Riley, you need to listen to me.
no matter what happens, if you see daylight, you run.
okay, don't wait for me. just run.
what? what are you do
if you see daylight, you run.
your strategy has changed from last time.
has it?
the first time we met, you tried to kill yourself.
you're right.
this time I'm going to kill you.
she hasn't been careful.
she's made mistakes.
not as many as you, but enough.
does she have damage to her chip?
she has damage to her chip.
how did you find the house?
the boy told me.
the one from the bowling alley.
you should have killed him.
just like you should have killed yourself.
I'm not a murderer.
who is?
Hello?
Sarah connor? james ellison.
I need you to come with me.
James ellison.
agent crossman, how you doing?
it's good to hear from you.
what's on your mind?
Mexico.
you don't say.
I suppose
that they don't have anyone looking into it
over at the bureau.
I know.
Connor's case has been cold since '99.
I was just curious.
sure, email it over and I'll take a look.
hold on.
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
it does look a little bit like him.
John connor.
God rest his soul.
you're with the american fbi?
Yes, that's right.
you have a boy in your custody.
his arrest report lists an alias of john connor,
which matches a fugitive of mine.
the domestic terrorism case.
you're familiar with the connors?
it was flagged during processing.
but we dismissed it as a coincidence.
your fugitive would be 24 years old by now,
if he was not already dead.
look,
I'd be grateful for just a visual identification
to help bring me some closure.
you have traveled an awful long way for closure.
if he is who I think he is,
then I have reason to believe that your prison is in danger.
and yes,
I've come a long way.
excuse me
I'm looking for john connor.
daylight, run!
John! I'm here to help you.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
the car, riley!
Riley, get in the car, now!
now! get in!
you okay? yeah.
are you okay? yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
are there any rounds in this thing?
look for ammunition. look for more ammunition.
we need more!
what, are you okay?
I just felt something back here!
stop the car. stop the car.
Sarah connor. james ellison.
I need you to come with me.
mom.
we need to move.
it's a clear shot all the way of the alley
back to the jail.
no, that's where it will be waiting.
let me do that.
I need to be able to use it.
I should hope so.
why are you here?
John was flagged in the fbi computer.
couldn't you just have buried it?
it's been watching me.
it?
out there.
it.
and you still came to mexico?
you could have led it right to john.
it wasn't me in the trunk.
so what were you going to do,
just pop him out of jail?
set him free, no questions asked?
Yes, actually.
that's exactly what I was going to do.
hm, I have a hard time believing that.
I owed you one.
the fire. silberman's cabin?
wasn't much.
it was my life.
how you feel about that now?
you have to go.
I promise I'll call you as soon as we get back to l. a.
but you have to go.
John. riley, don't.
go home.
I swear I'll explain everything when we get there.
go out the back.
run due east. there's a bus route.
you know what else there is?
a man with a gun who's killing people.
he won't follow you if you run away from me.
I don't wanna run away from you.
get her out of here.
I need your phone.
have a plan?
I've got a weapon.
Cameron.
the girl from the bank vault?
John and I are in trouble. I need you and cameron.
John's with you? well, we're here already.
we're at the jail. what?
cromartie's here.
then we should stay undercover.
I'm looking for john baum. where is he?
yo no se.
we gotta get out of here.
we gotta find john.
we're no good to him dead.
I can't let anything happen to him.
escaped or dead?
escaped!
a little help, por favor?
don't worry, it won't be back.
senor!
please!
John and I are in trouble. I need you and cameron.
John's with you?
well, we're here already. we're at the jail.
what?
wait, wait, wait, sarah.
then where the hell's cromartie?
I am sorry, senor,
but I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
I'm gonna need to see john connor.
help. help me!
Ayudame!
I'm looking for john connor.
he's gone.
are there any other exits?
no.
have you come to repent?
I'm looking for john connor.
all things are possible
to him who believes.
we'll attract less attention if we don't travel together.
you want me to leave?
what's next?
we'll come back down here.
and bring something with us to destroy it.
his name's gonna be on an alert.
he's got other names.
then what?
there is no "then what.
pretend I died again.
I lost a lot when you died the first time.
my marriage, my career.
that's a lot to you?
I suppose many people lost those things.
you want answers.
I just want to know my role
in all of this.
what happens after this?
this is it.
there's nothing else behind the curtain.
this is what I do. it's all I do.
you already know why I do it.
I'm sorry for what you lost.
but I can't help you get any of it back.
can I have the chip?
Dr. boyd sherman, child psychologist, family therapist.
what's his link to skynet--friend or foe?
Hey, baby.
are you awol?
Jesse, did you run from the war?
I need a place to rest.
what's next?
we'll come back down here
and bring something with us to destroy it.
I'm gonna be sick.
what's wrong with her?
I don't know. She's-- she's burning up.
I'm fine.
is she pregnant?
why in the hell would you even ask that?
kacy vomited when she was pregnant.
you're vomiting. it's morning.
that's when it happens. - Just shut up.
it's a bug or something.
stomach flu or something.
we'll be home soon, okay?
wait.
how do you feel?
how do I look?
like crap.
I wish I felt that good.
what's that?
it's rehydration fluid.
drink one cup every half hour or right after you vomit.
no, no, no. Where are you going?
we have to go back now.
back where? - mexico.
there's thermite in the garage. We need to burn cromartie's body.
cromartie's dead. you destroyed his chip.
you have to incinerate him, john. It's the only way to be sure.
he's buried in a hole in the middle of the mexican desert,
and his chip has been obliterated. I think we're pretty
safe? It's not safe.
Oh, god, she's starting to sound like you.
she's right.
I need to see you. now.
bring a gun.
I was over at the shopping mall this morning, right?
and I just-- i-i don't know.
I can't stop eating the crappy chinese food in the food court there. So I'm there,
and I'm just waiting for my food,
and I look across the way, and I see him.
I just see him.
you see him who?
Fischer. I see fischer.
who's fischer?
I don't--i don't know who you're talking about.
you do. you know him.
Charles fischer, sent back from the future,
and he works for the machines.
and he's gonna die.
what are you doing?
feeling what it's like to get away from it all.
I don't think you are.
what do you mean?
if by feelings you mean emotions,
I'm pretty sure you still don't have any of those.
and if by feeling you mean what it feels like
to have the wind blow through your toes or your hair...
I'm pretty sure you can't feel that either.
I don't think you understand how we work.
I have sensation. I feel.
I wouldn't be worth much if I couldn't feel.
so go through this again.
I've been-- I've gone through it again.
one more time.
I told you. I'm at the mall
just skip to where you follow this man To the parking garage and hit him with a brick.
he's a grey, derek.
at least tell me you remember the greys.
of course I remember the greys.
they were traitors. the worked for skynet.
helped the trip-eights act more human.
you don't remember him?
he was on the top of the list.
tell him!
tell him who you are and why you're here!
I don't know what you're talking about.
my name is paul stewart. That's my license. Look at my license. Please.
I'm not who she says I am!
liar!
it's a mistake!
for your sake, brother, I hope you're right.
I told you. paul stewart.
I-I-I repair watches. I have a shop in pasadena.
that's my license.
what are you doing here, fischer?
I was looking for an omega . 321 movement.
there's a secondhand store.
tin cans didn't send him back here to fix watches.
I think we all know that.
why don't you save us the trouble
and tell us the truth?
why are you here?
I'm paul stewart, I live On blackburn avenue.
your name is fischer. - no.
you work for skynet. - skynet? no.
what are you doing here, you murdering bastard!
do I know you?
no, you don't know me, and I don't know her.
I-I-I don't.
for the love of god, i-i-i'm not charles fischer.
I'm not.
I need you to be sure. - Sure of what?
him. - I am sure. you don't trust me?
it's not that I don't trust you. it's
I knew the greys.
Jesse, I knew them just like you did.
they were war criminals. we caught, what, four of them?
right, but we couldn't find fischer.
they kept him hidden. he was too valuable.
you really don't remember?
listen, if he is who you say he is,
then he deserves whatever is gonna happen to him in that room,
but not until he tells us who he is And what he's doing here.
do you understand?
he is who I say he is. - I want to hear him say it.
he will.
I'll show you.
Where's the rest of him?
it's not here.
not possible. we destroyed his chip.
he didn't walk out of here, but he's gone.
there's only one other person who knew about this.
and only one other person crazy enough to dig him up.
you hungry?
not hungry.
you a vegetarian?
no, I just--i don't know what's in that.
cheeseburger's in that. Eat.
Where's your friend?
out.
I'm not who she thinks I am.
I sure hope not.
I fix watches.
I used to be an engineer,
but it got old.
I was just a guy in a cubicle With a bunch of other guys in cubicles,
so I decided to go to bern to learn...
watch repair.
it's in switzerland. you ever been to switzerland?
that's a nice story.
you don't believe me.
I've told a few myself.
is she your girlfriend,
this, um, woman?
do you love her?
it's complicated.
well, i-i-i know complication. I'm a watchmaker.
it's a-- it's a watch joke.
if I were you, I'd eat.
listen to me.
people do crazy things when they're in love.
well, I do. But this is insane.
she says that you know me,
and--and clearly you don't know me.
there's something wrong with her.
so what'd they get you for?
d-did you hear what I just said?
it's prison ink.
Where'd you do time?
I haven't done Any time.
Yes, you have.
no, it's a ta-- it's a tattoo, 'cause i-i fi-- I fix watches. It's a clock.
with no hands.
it means till the end of time.
life sentence.
if I had a life sentence, what would I be doing here?
that's what I'm trying to figure out.

Hello?
I need to talk to you.

Derek. What'd he say? is everything okay? Is mom okay?
everything's okay. Don't worry about it.
can I help you?
I was waiting.
I heard...
do you remember me?
of course I remember you.
I have, um...
it's possible I have an emergency.
you came to my office over a month ago,
and you said your son needed help-- Therapy.
I never saw Either of you again.
wait. dr. sherman, please.
I've had some bad luck with shrinks.
well, you could stop calling them shrinks.
that might help.
sorry. - it's okay.
my assistant will be here tomorrow morning at 7: 00. Make an appointment.
I'm here now.
Sarah, make an appointment, please.
we'll see what we can do.
I've been sick... Flu or something.
I'm exhausted. I can't sleep, and when I do, I have dreams.
nightmares, actually. I walk in my sleep.
where are you walking to?
what do you mean?
I mean, where do you go when you walk?
I'm chasing someone, or I'm being chased.
but where do you go?
out. I get the hell out.
you're here. come on in.
there are many things I don't understand.
like what?
the tortoise.
what tortoise?
it was on its back by the side of the road in mexico.
your mother turned it over.
she was helping it.
I know. but why?
cause that's what we do.
when we, uh... When we see something That's, uh, in pain, or in trouble, or whatever, We try and help it.
empathy.
something like that.
but not everyone would turn the tortoise over.
no.
some would just leave it there.
some would probably drive over it and crush it.
Yeah, I guess they would.
is that what you'd do?
it didn't seem like much of a threat.
we're not built to be cruel.
Yeah, that's one for cyborgs.
Yes.
that's one for us.
what are you doing? - The body is gone.
what? - Cromartie's body is gone.
that's impossible.
you are the only one who knew where we buried it.
we need it. we have to destroy it.
what would I possibly want with it?
he's lying.
you don't know that.
please, John.
if you know, you better tell me right now.
I don't know.
I don't know.
let him go. - Why?
he's telling the truth.
we could find out for certain.
let him go.
sorry.
what the hell?
he doesn't want to tell us who he is.
I brought proof. - Proof?
please, please don't hurt me. Don't hurt me, please.
that's up to him.
who's he? - Who are you?
uh, my name is charlie fischer.
you were at my-- my job-- S. r.f.
uh, we do seismic retrofitting.
I'm a service technician. That's all. I'm--i'm nobody.
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
tell him who you are.
I've already told you who I am.
this is a trick, some crazy trick,
and you're all in on it, and you too.
what do you want from me?!
I want you... To tell me... The truth!
Oh, god!
if he is who you say he is-- - He is!
all right, fine. he is.
we need to know what he's doing here.
unless he's awol, like you.
he's not.
not this guy, not charles fischer.
he's been sent back By them for a reason.
you need to beat the hell out of him.
you need to get him to talk.
no, please. Please, please.
I'm sorry, Really
don't-- don't hurt the boy. Don't
some people, you can beat them and beat them,
and they'll take it. Whatever pain you give them, They absorb it,
like it was theirs all along, And all you're doing is giving it back to them.
you see, deep down, They hate themselves,
and they use that hate to eat the pain.
see, we were all good once.
we all loved ourselves once,
as young men Trying to get through the day,
or as kids Playing in the park.
okay.
stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.
my name is charles fischer.
I'm charles fischer. Now let him go.
he's got nothing to do with this.
just let him go.
this is impossible!
can't you people see that this is insane?!
why are you here? Why did they send you back?
they didn't. I'm not here on a mission.
nobody comes back without a mission.
this is my reward.
when the bombs dropped, I was locked up in pelican bay.
solitary confinement.
life sentence.
if I hadn't been in prison,
I never would've made it through judgment day.
once they got their hands on me,
it was either I teach them Everything I learned inside
or say good-bye.
and what'd you learn?
I learned what makes people tick.
so the fever that brought on the dreams
was caused by something you ate, you think, in mexico.
Yes.
what were you doing in mexico?
vacation.
family vacation?
Yes.
has anything happened since I saw you last?
what do you mean?
I mean, have you suffered a trauma?
um, has there been a crisis in the family,
something more between you and john since I've seen you last?
I came to you for help in understanding my dreams.
well, the problem is, Without knowing the details of your life,
I'm not sure what I can tell you beyond generalities.
I can tell you that dreams tend to mirror The central conflict in the dreamer.
would it be accurate to say That the central conflict in your life is your son?
Yes.
and your daughter, You have less conflict with.
it's different with her.
what is? Conflict, uh, type of conflict,
the--the nature of your relationship, what?
everything.
specifically.
I don't want to talk about her.
then why are you here?
I mean, you come in here Pretending to want to talk about your dreams,
and refusing to talk about john and cameron,
which, in my opinion, Is what your obsession with the three dots Is all about.
so if you only want to talk about One of those dots,
there's not much I can do.
I have no one else to talk to.
nothing is going to happen in here Until you decide to be honest.
you seem surprised.
judgment day...
machines...
you have no idea what you'd do.
what's the hardest decision you've ever had to make?
whether to stay with Rebecca
or take a chance on Christine?
whether to ask for time off For grandfather's funeral
because you're too afraid you'll be fired if you just take it?
you think You know who you are?
you don't have a clue.
can't you just tell them what they want to know?
what does it matter now?
you're here. you're safe.
are you?
no, he's playing with us, Making us think he's weak.
he's not weak.
how do you know?
I know, all right? I know.
you may not remember, but I know.
he is the worst of them. he's the worst.
he needs to die, derek.
forget why he's here.
forget whatever the mission is.
he just needs to die.
what did he do?
Jess, what did he do to you?
there was a raid on a bunker.
metal was everywhere.
they took out our command,
killed everyone over 30, Killed the children.
they took the prisoners to this place.
he was there.
he said he was gonna teach them how to talk to people,
how to get information from people, How to be people.
it was a kind of Perverse theater, like...
like he was teaching them.
how long did it go on?
weeks. Months.
there were drugs...
and starvation.
and he talked to you...
for hours... For days...
just to break you down,
just to get to your in
to get to you.
how'd you get out?
I don't know. You never told me.
what?
it wasn't me fischer had, baby.
it was you.
go to hell. Go to hell.
you don't remember.
I can't believe you don't remember.
but it was you.
my name is derek reese,
first lieutenant, 132nd s. o.c.
Yeah, well, good for you. - Not for you.
I told you I'm not on a mission.
I don't care.
Oh, yeah, you remember. you remember now.
I was wondering how long that was gonna take.
no, I don't remember.
but she does,
and that's good enough for me.
so you gonna kill me?
not you.
Oh, god. thank you. Thank you. thank you.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
I wasn't sleeping.
just needed to close my eyes for a few minutes.
how you feeling?
what does this mean to you?
I keep seeing it in my dreams, john. It means something.
mom, you're tired. you've been sick.
chasing killer robots will do that to you.
we couldn't find cromartie's body.
it wasn't there. it's gone.
he doesn't have it.
are you sure?
I'm sure.
Cromartie was in my dreams. It's connected. it's all connected.
mom, you had a dream.
it was my fault.
what was your fault?
Cromartie-- I led him to you.
what are you talking about?
there was this kid, a boy...
in the bowling alley. He was with the guys who broke into our house, And I sh
I knew what I had to do, john. I didn't do it. I let him go.
Cromartie must've found him.
we're not murderers.
you're not.
tell that to the boy.
I'm sure he's dead.
we have to find that body, john.
you don't think he'll...talk-- Young fischer.
we had to let him go.
he's not the monster we just buried.
let's hope he doesn't become one.
do you remember any of it?
even a flash?
no, nothing.
it was all we talked about, derek...
what he'd done,
how you were gonna find him one day.
you were obsessed.
it was a trauma. you've blocked it.
maybe, maybe not.
maybe--maybe it never happened to me.
Derek, I was there.
maybe I came from a future where it never happened,
and now you've come from a future where it did.
is that possible?
ever since I've been back here, I've--i've done... Things.
I've-- I've changed things.
maybe I changed the future.
that's why we're here, isn't it? To change the future.
do you think there's a version of the future Where we're not together?
no.
Charles fischer? - Yeah.
FBI, department of homeland security.
need you to come with us please.
two nights ago, you entered the building unauthorized At 4: 16 a. m.
what were you doing here?
that's a mistake.
two nights ago? no. I wasn't there.
I would have no reason to be there at that time.
computers don't lie, mr. fischer.
at 4: 23, Seven minutes after you entered the building,
there was an unauthorized access To the computer networking system.
that wasn't me.
this system allows user access
to all primary military-industrial complex computer systems.
I'm telling you that this is all a big mistake.
I do seismic retrofitting.
I don't even know how to access a computer system. Why would I do that?
I don't know, mr. fischer. You tell me.
why would you install a roving back door Into those computer systems?
one that we can't dismantle so far.
you want to tell us how to do that as ll?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wasn't there.
what happened to you? you look a little banged up.
want to explain that?
I don't know if I can.
try.
so...
what is it you wanted to show me?
we need to learn how they work...
how to fight them.
we can't allow history to repeat itself,
not when we have the power to stop it.
it's up to us now...
the two of us.
yes... It is.
what am I doing here?
I don't know.
it's a waste of time. you just lie and lie.
it's a waste of time. I just lie and lie.
don't you have things to do?
Yes, I do. I have things to do.
I should get back to work.
...from the beautiful Carlou Theater...
...in the heart of sunny Miami Beach, Florida...
...It's the Veterans Day Polio Telethon!
and now, please welcome your hosts...
...the beautiful, the talented, Lanny Morris...
...and Vince Collins!
do you realize we have to present ourselves...
...in front of these Iovely people for the next three days?
Hello, Iovely people for the next three days.
look at you. You're a disgrace. -What?
look, your hair's a mess, your shoes aren't shined, your shirt's not pressed.
look at your tie. It's not even straight. -Look at yours. It doesn't even clip on.
now...
...I'm upset.
you know what happens when I get upset.
no, no, no. PIease. PIease don't hurt me, Vince.
I've had a terrible day already. AII sorts of bad things have happened.
I don't wanna be hurt again.
you've been hurt already, have you? -Been hurt real bad.
and what happened, pray tell?
want me to pray or want me to tell? -I think you better pray.
I saw this stranger -I don't know whether you're...
...singing or speaking. -Leave my pad -One thing I do know... -And I said, "Baby...
...what explanation do you have?" -There's always a woman involved.
and she said:
next time? -Next time
and I said, "There will be No next time"
that's what you said Iast time, Lanny, and the time before that.
you have to make sure there's no first time, then there can't be a next time.
or a Iast time.
that was the last time for me -Let's hope so, Lanny.
Lanny Morris, Iadies and gentlemen.
my manager sent me over some of your work.
it's funny how you're really in them a Iot.
whenever I read these interviews where the writer says:
this is how I felt the morning I woke up to meet the pope..."
..."how I felt when the pope greeted me, how he reminded me...
...so much of my friend Mike..."
...I always think, "Who the fuck is Mike?"
so who are you?
I was a young journalist...
...with a few awards...
...a couple of cover stories...
...and a desperate need to prove myself.
if you Iook through my work, you'II see I try to present...
...a balanced view of my subjects.
I Ieave the conclusions to the reader.
or Ieaving the conclusions to the reader.
I'm used to being publicized, not analyzed.
it would be your words.
we'd publish it as a transcript:
my questions, your answers.
if you say it, I can use it.
if you don't, I can't.
and they're gonna pay me a million for this?
an excerpt will be published in a magazine as a way.....of amortizing the investment they'II be making in the book.
they're Iooking for some...
...provocative stories for the first issue.
any thoughts on what these provocative stories might be about?
the breakup. Why Lanny and you split.
and the girl.
Maureen.
what happened to Maureen O'FIaherty.
no one had ever been able to pin Lanny Morris...or Vince Collins to the girl's death.
all that was clear...
...was that Maureen was found dead in their hotel suite.
it was unthinkable to me that Lanny and Vince...
...could have had anything to do with it.
they were my heroes.
the reason I consider myself to be a miracle girl...
...is because I had the good fortune...
...to meet Lanny and Vince when I was sick.
their Iove of Iife is what gave me hope...
...and it's hope that gives us the power to Iive.
thank you, Lanny.
thank you, Vince.
come on, Iet's hear it for her.
Denise handled publicity for the polio foundation.
and it was her idea to plug the girl's story on the telethon.
the day before, it was my idea to plug Denise at the Miami Versailles Hotel.
don't stop! Don't stop!
don't stop!
you can tell a lot about a woman by the way she acts...
...when you're having sex and room service comes in.
some girls will sit up and light a cigarette...
...Iike there's nothing funny in the world about her being naked.
"it's obvious we were in the process of screwing...
...so why not let a stranger into the room?"
come on in.
then there's the kind that will pull the sheets up...
...and act like they're asleep.
where would you Iike it, sir?
sweetheart, wherever you'd Iike it.
then, of course, there's the ones who scrunch real flat...
...thinking that the bed will look empty.
with Denise, it was kind of hard to tell which way she'd go.
can I have your autograph, Mr. Morris?
sure.
should I make it out to Maureen?
I mean, your autograph on the bill.
okay.
I mean, I'd Iove to have your autograph.
and maybe a few minutes of your time.
I'm a huge fan and...
...well, I was thinking about...
...writing an article on you for my campus paper.
I'm the editor.
any interview requests go through me, honey.
you know, it's just a college paper.
thank you.
no, thank you.
thank you, Maureen.
I say goodbye to Maureen, knowing I'd see her again...
...close the door and then turn to look at Denise...
...thinking, "I know this girl from every college town we have ever played."
they're called career girls.
the absolute easiest lays...
...in this great nation of ours.
since you're reading this, you'd be interested to know...
... that my favorite catches were the intellectuals.
they'd be the ones in the straight black dresses, severe black hair.
your basic neurotic, eyeglasses, cool jazz, liberal...
... "I'll fuck any black guy as part of my personal apology...
...for racism in America " type.
anyhow, on this particular night, we're in a club in New Jersey...
...It's the 50s, and I'm mingling with the crowd.
now, when I say "mingling," what I mean is...
...I was scouting for who I would sleep with.
didn't matter if the girls came with dates.
that was Reuben's job. Reuben is my valet.
I never figured out how he helped them get rid of their dates...
...but they were always gone by the second show.
reuben could clean up any situation.
excuse me, miss. May I say that I think...
...you have the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen.
notice I say, "I think you've got the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.
I haven't seen them yet. I've been staring at your cans.
no, Lanny.
I can't believe he just said that. -That is completely unacceptable.
madam, I apologize. I apologize, Iadies and gentlemen...
...for my friend. You cannot speak that way to a stranger.
look, her husband's not offended.
he's not? -No, her husband's not offended.
her husband's not here. This Iucky guy is her boyfriend.
and even he's not offended, and do you know why?
well, I can certainly hazard a guess.
what the hell is that? For chrissake, Vince, this is America.
we don't say, "hazard a guess." We say "yes" or we say "no."
well, I say "no" to you, Morris.
excuse me? Could you repeat that?
I don't think the entire audience heard you.
go back to where you came from, bastard!
I get hecklers all the time, but this schmuck came off personal.
where did he think I came from?
bastard! Bastard! He called me a bastard.
now, it doesn't show from the front, Lanny.
now, please, would you kindly not mount me? It's very disagreeable.
Vince plunges straight into quoting lines I wrote.....from a song from our first motion picture.
I happen to be honored to work with this jerk
is that a compliment?
I never frown with this clown
never, never, never.
I get a kick from this...friend of mine
fine, but don't give the mike to this kike.
well... -Just relax.
it's not often we get topped by a member of our audience, but...
...this gentleman has done the impossible.
what is your name?
it's Joe. -Joe...
...we were just wondering if you'd be a great sport...
...and help us out on stage. What do you say, folks?
go on.
Joe here is going to play a crazy high school professor...
...who's about to give Lanny and I our final high school exam.
so if you'II just excuse us while we help Joe change into his...
...crazy-professor outfit.
Lanny, a Iittle costume-changing music...
...if you please.
step this way.
I'II have a word with him...
...about the way he spoke to your wife.
completely unnecessary.
just this way.
you call any Jew on this planet anything you Iike.
but nobody calls my partner a kike. Do you understand?
boffing ladies and bashing gentlemen.
I tell you, there was nothing under the sun...
... Vince and I wouldn't do for each other.
are you finished?
thank you, Mamie.
I'm sorry about that, Miss O'Connor.
we just needed to be sure you didn't take any notes.
Lanny gave me very specific instructions on that point.
I don't understand why he'd want me to read this.
why would he ever want anyone to see this side of him?
when you contacted us about meeting Lanny for your book...
...it wasn't simply about Ietting you know he didn't want to speak with you.
I believe my client wanted you to understand that he, in fact...
...was completing a book of his own which would serve...
...not only as his autobiography...
...but also as the definitive account of the joint careers of Morris and Collins.
you've had, at first hand, a sample of Lanny's writing voice.
Yes, I have.
such a book, Miss O'Connor...
...this raw, this honest...
...would make your own efforts
there's been some very nicetranslations of the Bible over the centuries...
...but they would run a very poor second in popularity...
...to the discovery of the actual Ten Commandments.
single best part about teaching grade two is the difference between the bright ones and the dumb isn't so obvious.
what's so great about that? -The results of my work as a teacher aren't so depressing.
aIso, there's no homework to correct in the evenings and...
...well, none of the kids know how to use drugs.
Bonnie had come from New York to visit me that summer.
we'd been best friends since kindergarten.
at school we started the Lanny and Vince Fan Club...
...raising almost $200 for that year's telethon.
aII of you send in a bit of your allowance.
just a Iittle bit. A dime, a nickel, a penny.
every bit helps.
the goal of the telethon that year was $3. 9 million, which was a lot of dough at that time.
thank you, Tom. You're a prince among men.
whoa, Lanny. There are children watching!
where does he get his energy?
to remind viewers of the goal...
...we agreed the telethon could run 39 hours nonstop.
the show would begin at 9 p. m. on Friday and finish at noon on Sunday.
we paced it so that Vince and I were together...
...for the kickoff, most of the day Saturday...
... then the big finale on Sunday with us bleary-eyed and weeping as America got ready to go to church.
Lanny, Lanny. What are you doing?
I'm ordering a pizza. I'm starving.
no anchovies on mine, Lanny. Hey, so who are you talking to?
I'm talking to Iittle Suzie from Whittier, California...
...and she is going to donate three weeks of allowance.
how about that, folks? -Suzie from Whittier, thank you.
three weeks of allowance.
that's a challenge for all you
what you have to understand is that Vince and me were essentially a boy-girl act.
I was the tramp, ready for any sort of action...
...and Vince was the gentleman...
...always trying to make me behave myself.
I was pleasure, and he was control.
I was rock 'n' roll, and he was class.
his presence gave America permission to like me.
my deal with the publisher gave me first-class travel...
...a luxury I'd never enjoyed.
is there any chance of switching to a window seat?
sorry, we're completely booked in first.
but these center seats are really wonderful. See...
...if you push here-- Can I show you?
sure.
the chair swivels to the Ieft and the right.
and this converts to a full-sized dining table...
...during our Pan Am platinum service with damask Iinen and silverware by Fornari...
...so you don't have to eat off a tray.
again, that's only for these center seats.
how does that sound?
at that time, when you traveled first class...
...people would always ask you if you met someone famous on the flight.
Mr. Morris. -Thank you.
you're welcome.
though he would later accuse me of engineering this, I didn't.
it just happened.
Reuben. So they-- They record these songs...
...in a studio that I am paying for.
songs that are recorded for me...
...that they are contracted to provide.
are you with me here? -Yes, it's just that
no, it's just that nothing, Irv. PIease, Iet me finish. They record...
I read an interview where Lanny was given credit for insisting his butler...
...travel in the same class and stay at the same hotels as his boss.
the valet's attentiveness was impressive.
looks Iike you'II be having dinner with Lanny Morris.
hello. -Hi.
we should get a waiter to slide a matchbook under the airplane.
there we go.
that should hold.
this is my friend Reuben.
Hi. -Hi.
and this is also my friend, technically speaking...
...and business manager, Irv. -Hi.
my name is Lanny.
and what's your name?
Bonnie. Bonnie Trout.
what do you do, Bonnie?
I teach.
and what do you teach?
second grade. -Well, we have a Iot in common.
you teach second grade, I went to second grade.
Irv, you went to second grade too? -Many times.
tell me, Miss Trout
I don't mean to be impolite but I was wondering...
...how a second-grade schoolteacher affords to fly first class.
well, I have a pass...
...that allows me free use of the subway on weekends...
...and the hot Iunches at school are only 50 cents.
and I'm the mistress of a wealthy married man...
...and when he and his wife go on vacation, he treats me...
...to a first-class trip in the opposite direction.
but Iook at me, talking only about myself. What do you do for a Iiving?
I'm a French impressionist painter out of Tahiti, mainly.
I'm doing that to pay the bills. My ambition is to be a stockbroker in Paris.
I don't get it. -Paul Gauguin.
he gave up being a successful stockbroker...
...to become a painter in the South Seas.
you think the average person knows that?
well, we're not talking about the average person, Irv.
in some ways...
...he had never stopped being a hero to me.
that's why it was impossible to think he might also be a killer.
well, this has been great.
I'm gonna see you inside your apartment.
there's really no need. -Don't be silly.
I'm not gonna try to come in.
promise.
you've been away from your apartment for how Iong now?
ages. -You never know if somebody's...
...broken in while you were gone.
I'II just see you inside your door.
believe me, I'm-- I'm not trying to seduce you.
I have to do the Today show at 7 a. m.
they want me in Makeup at 6: 1 5.
Bonnie had moved to New York for the teaching job a little over a year ago.
I had never visited her and had no idea if this was the right place.
which floor?
why...
it only goes up to six.
Four-D, the fourth floor.
which way?
guess. -Why?
it's a test.
a test?
okay.
this way.
so why didn't we take this elevator?
doesn't work.
well...
...Good night.
no, I'm going to see you into your apartment.
and then I'm gonna Ieave you alone until tomorrow.
I never get which key goes in which Iock the first time.
Hey, Iooks Iike they fixed it.
you okay?
maybe we should turn on a Iight.
well...
I'm going to Ieave you now.
I have Reuben and Irv waiting in the Iimousine downstairs...
...and I should get some sleep for the Today show.
so...
it was Iovely to meet you, Bonnie.
by the end of the telethon, we had no voices.
thirty-nine hours of nonstop entertainment.
a telethon was a superhuman feat.
we weren't just heroes, we were gods.
a couple of the boys were there to make sure we got out alive o make the flight to New York.
everyone. Listen. Listen.
gentlemen. Gentlemen, please.
gentlemen, if I could just have your attention.
everyone, Mr. Collins and Mr. Morris...
...will answer questions at the press conference at the Palace Del Sol.
gentlemen, there will be plenty of time...
...to answer your questions at the Palace Del Sol.
thank you, we will answer your questions at the press conference.
thank you for coming.
we had a full police escort, along with bodyguards who were there...
...to protect us from any thoughts we might have of going AWOL prior to this press conference.
a pair of New Jersey's finest walked on either side of us...
...as we entered the lobby of the hotel.
it was an indication of how legitimate the Mob had gone...
... that they could bring in the local police...
... to guard the fa? ade of their racket.
the local chief was a man named Jack Scaglia.
and of course, the two gentlemen on my right...
...who need no introduction, have come here directly from their record-breaking polio telethon in Miami, FIorida.
so the first thing I'd Iike to announce is that Mr. Sanmarco...
I wish I could tell you...
...that Sally Sanmarco was a slim, 6-foot-6 guy...
...who looked like a prince and spoke with an English accent.
then I wouldn't be falling back on the stereotype.
the trouble was, Sally was straight out of central casting.
a gangster who looked and talked...
...just like you would expect from the movies.
how did it feel to raise all that money for polio?
it felt great. It felt really great.
from a publicity angle, and in terms of giving him legitimacy...
...this was a huge coup for Sally.
like I said, we were gods.
we'd only been in the New York area for an hour or so, during which time...
... we were constantly watched by police and reporters...
... which ended up being a good thing for us.
we got you our best bridal suite.
fucking nice, huh?
people talk about having fancy apartments and hotel rooms on the West Side of Manhattan. What do they see?
fucking New Jersey. Here, you see New York City.
unfortunately, Vince and I were acquainted...
...with the dead girl in the bathroom of our hotel suite in New Jersey.
her last name was O 'Flaherty.
her first name was Maureen.
Karen, we decided to trade apartments, not identities.
why didn't you make up a name?
Bonnie, I was Iooking at a five-hour flight.
I didn't wanna make up a Iife story that wasn't attached to anything.
well, I returned the offense. I got to pretend I was you.
what? -You received a package.
messenger service. I signed your name.
who's it from? -No address. Want me to open it?
sure. -That's good. I already did.
it's a manuscript.
excerpt From the Memoirs of Lanny Morris.
Hey, all your dreams are coming true. He's writing you Iove Ietters already.
Bonnie, I need to know what he's written.
well, I'II send it to you. -Now. Before he calls me tomorrow.
pIease? -AII right.
aII right.
here we go.
"let me explain to you why two very famous guys just finishing...
...a nationally broadcast telethon ended up in New Jersey."
for years, the Palace Del Sol was one of the centers of Mob prosperity.
needless to say, a major headliner in the showroom...
...helped legitimize the entire operation.
give her a kiss. Yeah, beautiful.
one more, guys. That's it. That's great. Thank you.
Vince and I needed help in keeping us up all the time...
...anything you didn't take with a needle was okay.
it wasn't "serious" serious. It was like running a red light.
everyone used bennies. Vince added them to his morning coffee like sugar.
not that you could tell.
when we did finally decide to flatten out...
... we'd take two or three Tuinals, or three or four "Threeinals."
they were really good.
between the moment you took them and passing out...
...it felt really sexy.
sure.
enjoyed the show. -Thank you.
the walls of the Blue Grotto...
...were made of a mixture of plaster and Styrofoam.
flammable as all hell. But the boys had learned it was cheaper...
... to give the inspector 200 bucks and a ringside table to our show...
... than to spend thousands of dollars on fireproofing.
besides, it was always vital in a business enterprise of this sort...
... to have the option to torch the place at a moment's notice should the need present itself.
one night, after our show, we were taken to Sally's office.
we wondered what we had done wrong...
...but what we had done was done good.
Sally started going on about how much he liked us...
...how he thought we were a good fit with his crowd...
...meaning that we brought in an audience of heavy drinkers...
...adulterers and gamblers.
so, what we want is for you boys to come back here three months from now and open our new showroom for us.
a two-week, exclusive Iimited engagement...
...that we want you to do for us for six weeks.
God help you when a killer takes a shining to you.
I looked at Vince and scratched my nose, which meant our strongest "no."
that's a very great honor, Sally.
you're damn fucking right it is. -The thing is...
...we're just trying to cut down on the nightclub work at the moment.
we turned down the Sands so we could do a TV special...
...and the only reason we still work the Versailles is out of friendship for you.
what dates were you thinking of? -We open November 15th.
Sally, any other day we would be here in a flash...
...but, you know, that's the day right after the next polio telethon.
I mean, we always take two weeks off right after that to recover.
right, Vince? -At Ieast two weeks.
I mean, we're tired. -That's the way I want you.
after the fucking telethon, we fly you up from Miami...
...hold a press conference, all fucking exhausted...
...so people know what heroes you are.
I'II keep a suite for you with the best hookers I got.
your own personal cathouse.
and I'II have them send you up...
...a shipment of Iobsters and stone crabs.
you Iike Iobsters? -Love them.
and a case of these...
...special grapefruits...
...that I get special down there.
the most delicious thing you ever tasted in your Iife.
juicy, thin skin.
months later, on the night before the telethon in Miami...
...we got back to our room and found that Sally...
...had been more than good to his word.
laid out around the room were various crates...
...bearing the addresses of their destination:
our suite is at the Palace Del Sol hotel in New Jersey.
"you Iike Iobsters? See you in New Jersey."
"thin skin, fucking most delicious fucking thing...
...you ever had in your fucking Iife.
what I thought was a box of beach balls turned out to be...
...the thinnest-skinned, dripping-wet grapefruits...
...I'd ever tasted in my Iife.
the 6-foot crate was filled with fruits of the sea...
...slowly shifting over a bed of ice."
Yeah, this is Lanny Morris. Send up three steaks, all right?
Yeah. Make them rare this time.
Yeah, rare. -Like bloody.
BIoody. And a couple of bottles of that champagne.
make that three. -Three bottles of champagne.
and can you make sure that Maureen delivers them?
Yeah, Maureen.
we called down for Maureen...
...the room-service girl I'd met earlier...
...who wanted the interview for her school paper.
she brought up three steaks, one for her...
...as her last official delivery of the day.
as much as I love lobster...
...seeing all that shellfish nestled on ice in the crate...
...Put me in the mood for hooves, not claws.
the interview for Maureen's campus paper went better than expected.
Vince and I popped some Tuinals...
... to insure that we would sleep like babes...
...after we wore off the general horniness that the pills first give you.
Vince bought insurance on his bet by having a few babes on hand.
well, not exactly on his hand.
that wasn't his preference.
not exactly on his hand. That wasn't his preference.
not exactly on his hand? "That wasn't his preference?
the Tuinals, coupled with a nice amount of booze...
...guaranteed us the sleep of the dead.
late the next morning, Maureen was sent packing...
...and Vince and I prepared ourselves for that night's broadcast.
well, I guess this is one story my kids won't have to give a book report on.
Thanks.
must be weird to find out...
...that the object of all your adolescent fantasies is a pig.
he's not Iike that.
Oh, so it's just the way he describes himself.
she was right.
which was the real Lanny?
I'd find out later that the story of the hookers in the hotel suite...
...was a complete fabrication.
that night, Maureen was alone.
Hello? -So how did you Iike the show?
Lanny?
the Today show.
you did watch, didn't you?
the show. -You didn't watch.
wow, that's scary.
you see, when you're a star...
...you Iive in terror, wondering if it's all over yet.
you keep Iooking for the signs.
you're shooting a scene from a movie on a New York street...
...and a crowd doesn't form.
you meet a girl on a plane and tell her...
...that you're gonna be on the Today show the next morning...
...and she doesn't wake up early to watch.
it's very scary.
Hey, you know, I mentioned you on the air.
you did? -Yes, I proposed to you on the air.
your building is probably surrounded with photographers...
...at this very moment. -You're kidding.
Yes, I'm kidding.
so...
...what time would you Iike to meet?
stanley, this is Bonnie. Bonnie, Stanley.
nice to meet you.
is the food almost ready, Stan?
Yeah. I'II bring it right out, Mr. Lanny.
I was very hungry, so I asked Stanley to prepare us something special.
that sounds great.
tell me, what kind of a meeting does a schoolteacher have to go to during the summer vacation?
I'm exploring the possibility of another job.
something in publishing. -How did it go?
okay.
have you ever thought about writing a book?
about what? -Your Iife.
sure. When I'm dead.
no, seriously.
it would have to be published after I died...
...when I wouldn't care what anybody thought about me.
so, what would you write about, if you were going to tell the truth?
in my book?
well, the truth is, I've met four presidents.
they all seemed Iike they were out of it.
like they had no idea what was going on.
even J. F.K. Ieft me unimpressed. I felt Iike I was with the boss' son.
you don't think you could say that?
not if I was planning on Iiving in this country. No, no.
I don't think that Judy Garland was such a great singer after she turned 6.
that quiver, you know, it was Iike she had no control over it.
I would get killed for saying that.
or that Marilyn Monroe was no better an actress...
...after she studied with Lee Strasberg than before.
I'm saying what really happened.
having to be a nice guy...
...is the toughest job in the world when you're not.
this is a Iamb in tea sauce.
this is twice-cooked pork with shredded, pickled cabbage.
Kung Pao chicken.
and this is Kung Ping Loh Haa...
...Iobster in tangerine peel for you and your Iovely Iady friend.
you shouldn't have done that, Stanley.
I don't eat Iobster. I'm Jewish.
but you eat pork.
do you have a problem with that? -No, I just thought
no shrimp, no Iobster. They're disgusting. Take it away.
I will pay for the dish, but take it away, please.
I'II change it.
I'm sorry, I...
I should have asked. Maybe you Iove Iobster.
I'm fine.
have you ever had Szechwan cuisine before?
it's from the northern part of China.
it must be strange for you.
if you complain to a waiter, you're not just some jerk at table five...
...you're Lanny Morris.
I know that everyone dreams about being famous...
...but it would be interesting to know...
...what it's Iike to relinquish all anonymity.
gets me a date. -Does that bother you?
that people only wanna be with you because of who you are?
as opposed to? -Well...
...the real you.
the real me.
the real me was brought up as a nice middle-class kid...
the real me spent most of his time getting the shit kicked out of him...
...and dreaming about something better.
fifteen years ago, he had, for one brief moment...
...made me feel like the most special person in the world.
the miracle in my Iife is not that I survived polio...
...and am standing here today.
no. The reason I consider myself to be a miracle girl...
...is because I had the good fortune...
...to meet Lanny and Vince when I was sick.
it was a moment seen by millions of people...
...but felt only by me.
that moment had changed my life.
I was about to find my own way into Lanny's book...
...after he had found such a powerful way into mine.
checking out today?
is there a message for Bonnie Trout?
from one of our guests? -Yes, Lanny Morris.
I'm afraid not.
are you sure? -Oh, yes, I'm sure.
do you need a cab?
I still don't understand why Vince Collins is willing...
...to be involved in such an expose of himself.
Vince is a realist.
the days of his box-office power are drawing to a close.
given the amount of money we're offering
and it's because the investment in Mr. Collins is so Iarge...
...I've compiled a Iist of questions we'd Iike the miracle girl to ask.
I don't wanna Iook at your questions. I have my own approach.
ms. O'Connor, we're not paying a million dollars for your approach...
...we're paying for what Vince Collins has to say.
to me. What he has to say to me.
Greg, this is not as easy as it Iooks.
if you go to Vince Collins and ask him a series of questions...
...you'II come back here with a 300-page press book.
well, as I've always understood this company's policy...
...while the book is being written...
...the relationship between the author and editor is sacrosanct.
this isn't your typical book deal.
we've really just Ieased an oil well called Vince Collins...
...and granted Ms. O'Connor the right to tap.
I think we have a responsibility to...
...monitor the drilling.
hello. -Mrs. O'FIaherty?
Yes.
my name's O'Connor. I'm the one writing the book.
the book will be centered around Vince Collins.
I'II be asking him a Iot of questions.
I wanted to know if there were any you'd Iike to have answered yourself.
Maureen and I planted this tree on her fifth birthday.
father did most of the digging, of course.
she'd be 38.
I'm 59 myself.
if she were alive now...
...we'd be talking about things, back and forth Iike two women.
like you and I are doing.
and Maureen's father?
Frank died six years ago.
he took his own Iife.
one night, just before he died...
...he dug up the earth around this tree...
...he took the urn with Maureen's ashes in it...
...and spread them around its roots.
so this is my daughter.
this is what I have of her.
are you Catholic? -My-- My mother was.
then you will understand my dilemma.
our faith offers an afterlife.
a daughter needs her mother.
so I have to Iive out this Iife as far from sin as I can manage.
I'll never see my husband again.
he's consigned himself to hell.
but what if Maureen killed herself too?
she's in hell, with my husband.
the Iife I'm trying to Iead will bring me to heaven's grace...
...only to hear their screams of torment.
chief Scaglia, you were in the hotel room...
...when they found Maureen's body in the tub.
so was Sally, so was Lanny, so was Vince.
and there was also a PR Iady there from the hotel.
how do you think she died?
she died in an auto accident two weeks Iater. It was terrible.
no, Maureen.
how did Maureen die? -She drowned.
Why? -What do you mean, why?
you and I take baths all the time. We don't drown in them.
you and I do not mix sleeping pills with booze.
she committed suicide? -Overdose is the official story.
what's the official story on the fact that the staff of the hotel in Miami...
...all seemed to know she delivered room service to the boys' suite hree days before and was never seen alive again?
what happened to her?
how did she end up in a hotel room in New Jersey?
Sally never had any problem moving girls around. Okay?
he had two hotels.
so Sally arranged it? -No, I don't think so.
you see, she was brought up there as a reward for the boys...
...and I think she started to party just a Iittle too early.
she was a student. This was a summer job.
listen to me...
...the Palace Del Sol was very important to Sally, okay?
he Iaunched his new wing with a push from Lanny and Vince...
...and this stupid girl shows up dead.
she's not gonna come back. We do the best thing for all of us.
we speed up the investigation and we cremate her. Okay?
end of story.
here you are. -Here's your Iobster.
enjoy. -Looks great.
Sally said, "I'II have them send you up your own shipment of Iobsters.
you like lobster?"
we said we did because we really did.
you shouldn't have done that, Stanley. I don't eat lobster.
were there any signs of violence on her body?
no, no. There were some small scratches on the torso.
why did my daughter die? Did she kill herself?
what had they done to her that would make her do that?
what had they done?
once upon a time...
... when terrible things happened to people...
... they were left as a mystery.
even the tabloids kept a distance.
some things were allowed to be left just the way they were.
any trouble with the directions I gave you?
only the parts where I had to turn. -Sorry.
it's the price of seclusion.
you haven't switched over to cassette?
actually, it's my dad's. -And what does he do?
he was a journalist too.
he did a big story on you once.
followed a Iittle girl who had polio.
you took her under your wing...
...and now she's interviewing you.
he must be proud that his daughter's making such a name for herself.
I'd Iike to think so.
he died Iast year. -Sorry to hear that.
would you Iike some coffee? -Sure.
are you alone here?
Yes. The thought of having Iive-in help is a Iittle poisonous to me.
Why's that?
well, I'd have to talk to them...
...ask them how their family was doing...
...hear about this and that, introduce them to the guests...
...and tell them how their family was doing.
aII so that I would seem to be a nice guy...
...which is an awful Iot of work...
...considering what I cherish most in Iife these days...
...is not to have to be Vince Collins.
no Reuben in your Iife?
how do you know about Reuben?
he was in a Iot of the material I've been Iooking at.
no, I never had a Reuben.
Lanny always paid him directly. He was Lanny's man.
right.
you know, what I Iike is to read, think.
it's to have the freedom to get up and Ieave without telling anyone about it any time of day.
or even having to say goodbye.
to be backstage, surrounded by acrobats, actors, magicians...
...it was intoxicating.
you know, I was only 12 years old.
that's a...
that's a pretty impressionable age.
to hear all these stories of touring... -My father always told me...
...that nothing had meaning unless it could be put on the record.
yet things had changed.
as Vince had pointed out at our first meeting...
...it had become fashionable to put yourself into the story.
the question became how far you were prepared to go.
excuse me. That's not mine. -Oh, I'm sorry.
aren't you Miss Trout?
we've met, on the plane to New York.
Reuben. -Excuse me, sir.
can I Ieave you for just a second, please?
I'm so deeply sorry, Miss Trout, the way you were treated.
he could have Ieft a note. -Of course.
miss Trout, I would Iike you to understand something.
I have a great Ioyalty to Mr. Morris. He's treated me very well.
I'm very grateful.
he has done wonderful things for many people and I have been privileged to work for him.
but I do have certain principles...
...especially about how women are to be treated and respected.
Mr. Morris can be very attentive, but once he has a woman...
Oh, God, I think it's almost a sickness.
when he Ieft you that morning...
...you may have felt bad, but believe me, Miss Trout...
...to have him out of your Iife is the best thing that could have happened to you.
at that point, you may have felt your Iife was wounded.
it wasn't.
it was saved.
Vince, I was very clear about this from the beginning.
I'm not out to play games with you.
this is why you're being paid a huge amount of money.
this isn't entirely about money, you know.
a million dollars is more than the gross of your Iast film.
I was somehow under the impression that my Iife might have been of more than passing interest.
but if my fleeting encounter with a girl named Maureen O'FIaherty...
...is all you really want to talk about, then that's what we'II do.
I have to make an appearance at the clinic tomorrow.
we can come back and talk after that.
it's Wonderland.
I imagine you might remember that.
he was right. I did remember Wonderland.
you ready? -Ready.
when I was a girl, the entire hospital was devoted to children with polio.
since that time, it had become a clinic for kids...
... with a variety of different physical handicaps.
once a year, the children would put on a pageant...
...playing different characters from AIice in Wonderland.
Vince, in his continuing support of the hospital had hired a band and a singer.
who is that?
I don't know. She's good, whoever she is.
Karen, do you mind if we start this conversation tomorrow?
I'm just... I'm not feeling all that well.
Vince-- -In fact, it won't make...
...any difference over there. The office is closed.
they've been working Iate.
then they've been working much too hard.
first thing tomorrow. First thing.
I hope your editors were reasonable.
reasonable? No, they weren't.
we can go as Iate as you Iike.
that's good.
it might take us into the evening.
I had a feeling that might be the case.
so I've ordered a hot and cold smorgasbord to be brought in.
we can work through dinner.
we'II be having company? -Yes.
I have a surprise for you.
actually, this is a fairly big deal for me as well.
I've asked Lanny to join us today.
Lanny?
well, this is something.
neuman and Newberry will certainly be getting their money's worth.
I thought that if I was going to discuss something...
...that had such an impact on our Iives...
...it would be fair for Lanny to hear what I had to say.
given that we've never talked about it.
I'm sure I'II have Iots to ask him. When is he coming?
he should be here any minute now.
this is very exciting.
shit.
yes? -Bonnie, I have to talk fast.
I need you to do exactly as I tell you and I can't tell you why, okay?
sure.
excuse me, that might actually be him now.
Yes, hello?
Yes, thank you.
that was my office.
there's a woman-- A friend, a relative of yours?
she said she called on a number you gave her.
she's gonna call back.
yes? -Hi, kiddo.
listen, your brother Clifford has just been rushed to the hospital.
he was doing construction when a thing
a steel girder? - That's it.
you better come to the city and make your peace with him.
you're booked on the next flight to San Francisco.
I'm waiting here for you in front of the terminal.
they reserved me a seat on the next flight to San Francisco.
I'II drive you there. -No, no.
Sharon is waiting at the airport for me. You can't stand Lanny up.
pIease give him my deepest apologies.
Hey. -PIease, I can explain.
you've broken the Iaw, Bonnie-fucking-Trout.
you've assumed another person's identity to get information from a business competitor.
obviously I Iied about who I was. I'm sorry.
it was a huge untruth. It wasn't planned.
I was just freaked out about suddenly being on the plane with
with you...
how did you get the seat behind me on the plane?
it was pure coincidence. -Bullshit!
it's true.
how could you...? How could you have just Ieft me at the hotel Iike that?
you were asleep.
reuben woke me to say I had to be a substitute performer...
...at a charity concert at the Hollywood Bowl. I had to get the first flight out.
you could have Ieft a note or called.
I did Ieave you a note. -Where?
I don't know why we're even talking about this. I don't Iike you.
aII right? I wish we had never met.
Hello, Vince.
what the fuck's going on?
Vince, a few days after we first met...
...I found myself next to Lanny on a flight to New York.
it was a complete coincidence.
he asked my name... -And she Iied.
I had just finished reading the first chapter of Lanny's own biography.
his Iawyers had Iet me see it in the hope of discouraging our own project.
as a reflex, since I knew he would view me as the enemy...
...I gave him the name of a friend whose apartment I was staying at in Manhattan.
I thought I just had to get through the awkwardness of the flight itself...
...but the trouble is... -You slept with him.
Vince... -You slept with my ex-partner.
technically.
doesn't sound Iike things were particularly technical.
now, you Iisten to me, sweetheart.
Vince doesn't always do what's best for Vince.
that's why he needed me here today.
the story of this girl is the most painful thing in his Iife.
what happened to her, Lanny?
well, you're not gonna find out.
not now.
not after what you've done to him.
Vince.
Oh, shit.
Vince...
...I made a terrible mistake in New York.
I apologize to you more than I know how to say.
I'm so sorry.
Vince, the realization of your Iife story...
...shouldn't be threatened because of my failings.
pIease Iet me continue to work with you again.
I'II help you tell your story right.
come back tonight.
let me think about it.
how do you Iike the wine? -It's magnificent. What is it?
1 961 Haut-Brion.
people make a big deal of 1 959...
...but I don't think there'II be a year as special as 1 961.
it was a great year for French wines.
will you join me?
what are they?
they're Iike very mild-mannered Quaaludes.
must've done a few of those in your time, right?
are you sure they're okay with alcohol?
Oh, they're even better with alcohol. Believe me, I'd know.
come on in, honey. The water's fine.
all my life, I've had this idea that I could always be in control.
ever since I was sick, I had this sense that I could make my body do anything I wanted.
if I could will my polio away...
...I'd certainly be able to will away the effect of any drug.
do you mind if I close the drapes? The sun's in my eyes.
it's moonlight.
go ahead.
I remember you.
you're AIice.
in Wonderland.
Oh, I don't know.
I'm really stoned out of my head already.
is it good?
Jesus, Vince. It's Iike monster grass.
do you get this stuff all the time?
aII the time.
you're AIice.
you're so beautiful.
she's ours.
isn't that so, AIice?
I'm yours.
I Iike you.
I had always been fascinated by how some women could cross the line between who they were and who they would let themselves become.
Maureen...
...Alice...
...and now...
...me.
morning.
that was not a Quaalude you gave me. I've had Quaaludes.
I said it was Iike a Quaalude.
and you didn't take one yourself. You palmed the pill.
somebody had to drive.
don't worry, you won't get pregnant.
not from AIice, and certainly not from me.
I never took off my pants, as you may or may not remember.
there are Iaws against drugging people.
Oh, please. You took it voluntarily. Nobody slipped it into your drink.
and you chased it with one of the most expensive wines in the world.
you're just in a dither because you've discovered you can swing both ways.
you see...
...I needed to get something on you.
of course, your behavior with Lanny might have been even better than this.
but I'd already set the wheels in motion.
and as I was dying to see you and AIice get it on...
well, these are just a sample.
why would she agree to do this? Doesn't she want a career?
well, it's your career I'm worried about.
you're a journalist playing Ioose with the rules.
she's just a vulnerable young singer you seduced.
a promising...Oh, good heavens.
promising artist that I happen to manage.
you met her through me...
...and had your way with her.
what do you want from me?
you're going to continue writing the book.
I'm going to continue telling you juicy stories, funny stories...
...heart-tugging stories.
and you're not going to ask me a single question about what happened to the girl in New Jersey.
you're going to go to your publisher, say you tried every angle...
...but you could find nothing odd or suspicious in what I told you.
I'II even try to spice it up a Iittle, talk about how...
...the night before the telethon, I wanted to sleep Iike a babe...
...so to cover my bets, I kept a few babes on hand.
well, not exactly on my hand...
...and that's not my preference, as you might have gathered by now.
so you get your bestseller, I get my million.
everyone goes home happy.
you've dreaded talking about Maureen O'FIaherty since we met.
if it's something you're so desperate to avoid...
...why would you ever agree to do this book?
I need the money.
Vince, anything you say in my presence is mine to use.
everything you said Iast night and everything you've just told me.
and since I'm also allowed to include contextual background...
...I can write about how you set me up...
...how you tried to blackmail me. I'II even include those Polaroids.
it's your word against mine. We have a contract. Everything's in my words.
we've agreed to your answers, but there's nothing to stop me from putting any information I want into a question I ask.
information that I'd Iike to be public knowledge...
...or that the police might wanna Iook into.
would you Iike me to fire one of my Ioaded questions, on the record?
sure.
Vince...
...in your suite at the Versailles Hotel in Miami was it your or Lanny's idea
...to put Maureen's body into the case containing shellfish and ice and have it shipped to New Jersey?
no answer, Mr. Collins? So noted.
Oh, and incidentally, by not answering...
...you're in violation of your contract.
what a shame. I understood you needed that money.
Oh, no. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God!
was that how you murdered Maureen?
ask Lanny.
he's the one who knows.
it wasn't that hard for him to get the suite he wanted.
the Versailles was still one of the fanciest of the hotels along the beach.
but by then, its era had passed.
thank you, sir.
all the furniture was new.
it had been 1 5 years...
...but the floor plan...
... was still the same.
in that spot...
...that was where the truth had come out.
that was why she had to die.
are you Japanese or Chinese?
Vietnamese.
the kitchen tell me you famous person.
why you famous?
they didn't tell you my name?
no.
what is it?
Lanny Morris.
it's a Jewish name...
...but I'm a nebbish.
you ordered three bottle of champagne.
you want me to open one now?
or wait until friend come?
open all three.
are you really famous, Mr. Morris?
in my day.
before your time, I suppose.
I come from the north of Vietnam.
in my town, there is no television.
she explained that American movies had been banned where she grew up.
she got better tips pretending she was Madame Butterfly...
... than by telling people where she was really from.
what did you do, Mr. Morris?
I made Vince Collins' Iife very difficult.
she didn't understand, but her policy was not to linger in the rooms of solitary gentlemen.
he signed the room-service check under Lanny's name.
thank you.
there was no ice or water left in the buckets when his body was discovered the next morning.
he had dumped the ice into the bathtub and died in it.
he must have felt there was some poetry in it.
his plan was to drink enough champagne...
... with enough sleeping pills...
...so that ending things would become an acceptable idea.
he could manage that.
he knew for certain he couldn't manage anything else.
Hi.
I thought you were gonna be out all afternoon.
I'm sorry.
it's okay.
this was under the door.
what is it?
chapter three.
John, as my lawyer, I want you to know that this next chapter...
...is to be read after Vince and my death...
...and is only to be used under the most extreme of circumstances.
we knew we wanted to make an early night of it with the telethon starting the next day, so Vince suggested we dine in...
...so Maureen could do the interview for her campus paper.
this is a gift for us from the audience...
...from the people, the people that are out there.
sooner or Iater you gotta say, "We wanna give something back."
I think that's really important.
not many people would take the time out to do that. Thank you.
she actually hid her tape recorder in the room-service cart...
...because she didn't want the hotel to find out.
we finished the interview and then asked her to stay.
to help us get into the mood, I did a Tuinal...
... then she did one...
...and Vince, he did two, because he was always doing two.
we thought it would be better to keep the action to neutral territory.
God...
... she was beautiful.
I chain-locked the front door to the living room...
... to make sure that housekeeping, eager to turn down our beds...
... with the hotel's headliners.
then I went to chain-lock the door to Vince's room.
I took a quick shower, I put on my robe...
...and brought a robe for Maureen, in case she felt a little bashful.
so much for bashful.
I threw the robe on the bed and moved into the room...
...half-worried that they would finish without me.
I've always preferred the missionary position.
I have to see their faces, look into their eyes.
unless they're acting, and I'd like to think I can tell the difference...
... there comes that moment...
... when, if you're looking...
...if you're really looking...
...you'll see exactly who she is.
this was different.
it was like she saw exactly who I was.
watch it there, compadre.
it's a Iittle hard to tell who's who, under the circumstances.
I'm the one that's more than a Iittle hard, you dumb fucking Iimey.
well, I'm... I'm the one with a foreskin. Don't you forget that.
watch it. You got the end zone there, Vince.
come on, come on. Fuck. -You're gonna Iike it.
it's Iike from another planet when you come.
get the fuck off me. -I'd never hurt you.
I'd never hurt you. -Get the fuck off me!
no, trust me. It's Iike double the sex...-Get the fuck off me!
we don't fuck, Vince!
we're buddies, we're pals, we're partners, we're a duo.
we Iove each other, but we don't fuck!
we're fucking stars!
we can travel together. -Okay.
we can hang out together, we can Iive together, but we can't be queers!
it's not funny!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
about?
about your nose.
it's not broken, is it?
it's how I am.
guess the question is, who's gonna pay me?
this surprised me.
the girl was not a hooker.
my wallet was on top of my robe.
I took out some money.
I don't remember how much.
I don't think so.
that's more than you would make in a month of tips.
I'm not Iooking for a tip.
what the hell are you saying?
honey, I'm in my Iast year of college.
this is a summer job.
I wanna write.
I wanna be a journalist.
so I could either use this information...
...or I could use a Iot of money.
I promise you this will only cost you once.
I'm so tired, I don't even think I'm going home.
I think it's the Tuinals.
Hey, Lanny, don't take it personally.
you were a great Iover.
you have got the cutest Iittle butt.
I guess Vince thinks so too.
night, Lanny.
I would never see her alive again.
I put a "Do Not Disturb" sign on my door...
...fastened the chain lock, in case the maid didn't read.
I left a wake-up call for 8...
...and went to sleep knowing that a telethon was the least of the ordeals I was going to have to face in the morning.
the Tuinals had really conked me out...
...and I slept through my wake-up call that morning.
the operator had called Reuben down the hall...
... to see if he could wake me...
...but he couldn't get in because we had chain-locked all the doors.
Reuben!
I yelled for Reuben to wake up Vince while I worked on Maureen...
...trying to make myself believe that she was still sleeping.
fuck.
no, no. Fuck.
the autopsy revealed the drugs and alcohol in her body...
...but I knew it wasn't enough to kill her.
all three doors to the suite...
...were chain-locked from the inside when I found her.
I hadn't touched her.
that's how I know that my former partner and friend, Vince Collins murdered Maureen O 'Flaherty.
you must have guessed by now that Vince and I had found a way...
... to relocate Maureen's body to New Jersey.
this is the one criminal act the both of us committed...
...but we were in a panic and needed to create an ironclad alibi.
the crates were delivered to our room.
the publicist had opened the crates for a photo.
but the official story became...
... that she found Maureen's overdosed body in the tub.
a police officer called Scaglia was there to witness the whole thing.
live, until they drop dead...
during the telethon...
...I kept telling myself that I could forgive Vince for two reasons.
first of all, I don't think he could have known what he was doing.
he was completely out of it, even more than usual.
the second is that he was terrified...
... that this incident would become public knowledge.
in those days, the slightest hint that he could swing both ways would destroy his show-business career in an instant.
as it was, it was only to destroy us.
we completed the telethon...
...but we both knew we were finished.
the marriage was over.
there was a moment in the middle of the telethon...
... where I actually broke down.
I just couldn't control myself.
I remember I mumbled something...
... to a little girl who was recounting her experiences with the disease.
I don't remember what I said...
...but I do remember feeling worthless.
everyone thought that my tears were for her.
it made for a great picture in the papers the next day.
Mr. Morris will see you now.
I expected to see you at Vince's funeral.
kind of heartless of you not to show up, don't you think, Karen?
considering you're probably the one that...
...drove him to it.
I won't answer that.
so don't.
so get the fuck out of my office.
Lanny, I have interview material with Vince up until the moment he met you.
it would be great if this...
...warm, funny side of Vince could reach the public.
and what the fuck do you know about Vince's warm and funny side?
what about the warm and funny fact that he killed himself?
why would he do that? -I don't know.
that's the answer I'm giving you...
...and anyone else that asks.
"I don't know." -But you do know, don't you, Lanny?
whatever I know, sweetheart...
...I'm writing in my book.
except you're never going to finish your book.
you don't have to.
the person who needed your book is dead.
you always wrote the material for your shows.
every single word was rehearsed.
the book was a manual, a set of notes...
...so Vince would get every detail of the official story.
a couple of extra babes for him to sleep with that night.
a few of them on hand.
well, not exactly on his hand. That wasn't his preference.
so, what's your point? -He quoted that very Iine to me.
quoted it from your manuscript as if he were saying it for the first time.
you wrote it because you Ioved him.
and feared for him.
and feared for yourself.
and then you wrote this:
where the fuck did you get that?
delivered to my room. -Bullshit. You stole it.
Maureen O'FIaherty was killed in the Versailles Hotel, in your room...
...the night before the telethon.
the night before we met.
get out of my office.
miss Trout?
we walked through the deserted backlot of the studio...
...and I confessed that I wasn't Bonnie Trout.
that I was writing a book about Vince Collins.
and that I was trying to uncover the secret...
...behind what happened to Maureen O 'Flaherty.
I told him what I found out.
he prayed that he would be forgiven...
...for having been there as the murder was concealed.
miss O'Connor...
...I have a tape recording of the night Miss O'FIaherty was killed.
she had brought a machine.
for the interview. -Yes.
I found it as I was getting rid of her things.
she kept it on?
could you use this tape for your book?
of course.
miss O'Connor...
...is it something...?
Oh, my.
is it something I could sell?
Reuben, I can't speak on behalf of my publishers...
...but I'm sure that we can settle on a price.
Oh, thank you, Miss O'Connor.
I'll even spice it up a little, talk about how...
...the night before the telethon, I wanted to sleep like a babe.
so to cover my bets, I kept a few babes on hand.
well, not exactly on my hand.
that's not my preference, as you may have gathered by now.
I need the money.
did you have a figure in mind?
would you think a million dollars would be too much?
Vince was being paid a million dollars for his Iife.
this is one night.
the most important night.
you could have left me a note or called me.
I did leave you a note. -Where?
Lanny Ieft this for me at my apartment.
it's his version of what happened that night.
on its own, it's absolutely useless to me.
I could have typed it myself.
but if it matched what's recorded on your tape...
...it would make it priceless.
which is why you sent it to me.
you just said Mr. Morris Ieft it at your apartment.
he was surprised I had it.
like he was surprised I hadn't found the note he Ieft for me at the hotel.
the note you must've disposed of as you were tidying the room.
I told you how he deals with women. I was afraid.
really afraid of what he might do to you.
maybe you were afraid of what I'd
I'd do to him. And to you.
why would I be afraid of a schoolteacher called Bonnie Trout?
because you knew I was Karen O'Connor.
when I woke up, you folded my clothes...
...and placed my pocketbook on the bed.
the pocketbook that had my name and the Ietter from my publisher.
I was writing about the one thing you wanted to have total control over:
Collins and Morris.
you made me abandon any thought of trying to contact Lanny.
you made me feel Iike I was Iess than nothing to him...
...because you were playing your own complex game.
and what exactly was this complex game I was playing, Miss O'Connor?
you were in the room.
that night.
Lanny had a robe. He dropped it on the bed.
after Maureen asked for money...
...the wallet was on top. It had been folded.
well, I always, always arranged Mr. Morris' things.
after he went to bed. You were there before.
how would I get out? AII three doors were chain-Iocked.
through Vince's room.
then, the next morning...
...you must have chain-locked the door before you went to wake him up.
fuck!
Lanny Iet me read the first chapter.
Vince sent me the second.
and you stole this.
to whet my appetite.
I wanna write.
I wanna be a journalist.
so I could either use this information...
...or I could use a lot of money.
is that why you killed her?
t o protect them?
for 15 years...
...he tormented Vince and Lanny.
he could never blackmail Vince while Sally Sanmarco was alive...
...so he waited until Sally died to activate his retirement plan:
a million dollars from Vince.
a million dollars for the same tape he offered to me.
he would never get his money, and I would never see him again.
he had taken her life...
...and with it her mother's heart...
...and her father's mind.
and now...
...all that remained of Maureen O'Flaherty was a tree in her mother's garden.
your daughter Iearned something about Vince Collins...
...that he didn't want anyone to know.
because of that...
...she was killed.
if it's of any small comfort, she probably didn't suffer.
I want people to know about this man.
I want them to know why he killed her.
there is someone in all this...
...who is totally innocent of any involvement...
...in the events of that night...
...but whose Iife will be made infinitely worse if I tell the truth at this time.
I wanna protect this person from any further pain.
I promise you
I promise you I will write down the truth that I've Iearned but I have to Iet matters Iie until this person has died...
...and the truth can no Ionger touch them.
I saw no indication on her face...
it has to be from downtown.
it's handIed through this office, but it requires downtown approvaI.
I don't know.
it has been submitted.
SyIvia, can you heIp me with this?
coming.
cIosing time. Going in?
Yes, sir.
you the manager?
keep taIking Iike nothing was wrong.
let me caII you back.

42 peopIe kiIIed. The innocent with the guiIty.
I won't take you. I'II take one of the girIs, a married one with kids.
cops don't Iike it in the papers when they shoot a married woman with kids.
you're aII right.
you won't fuck with me?

and you know something?
nobody said "'hostage"' yet, okay?
we got a bank robbery here.
how did the press guys get through the barrier?

MuIvaney speaking. -Moretti here. Let me taIk to him.

I just want to find some way that I can trust you too.
not be on the street where you couId shoot me.

let the peopIe out.
who do you think you're deaIing with? A fucking idiot here?
they're keeping me aIive. Let them out?
taIk to me. Just taIk to me straight. I'm ready to taIk.
give us the women?
no, I've got women. That's aII I've got.
give me something. Give me one of them.
one? -It's Iike a fair exchange.
I'II come over. I won't pack nothing, don't know if you'II take me hostage.
it's a sign of trust.
how do I caII you back? -It's a direct Iine.
pick up the receiver and I'm here.
he wants one.

right!
he goes.
what are we deaIing with here?
you have to keep checking me out aII the time?
Yeah.
he'II need the keys.
got the keys?
just the one, Sonny!
don't fire!
what are you doing?
that's a hostage!
don't fire!
hoId your fire!
we voted to send him out!
he's one of the hostages! -Get away from him!

I don't give a fuck! Get out of here.
Hey, Sonny! Wait a minute!
that was your fauIt, Sonny.
we had the communications set up here.
we're not set up properIy, with 250 cops here.
we don't know what goes on in there.
you aImost kiIIed him! Are you crazy? -That was smart!
you say you got nothing but women, and throw out a guy. What's going on?
you wanted a hostage, I gave you one.
are you going to deaI with us or not? -I gave you one.
you did, but you shouId have picked up the phone! Come on out.
I ain't packing nothing, see?
you can come out and frisk me. You can teII.
Why? -To take a Iook at something.
to see what you're up against. -I can see. Why come out?
come out and see it aII.
sai is in there with the other peopIe. Anything happens to me, they'II get it.
I don't forget about SaI. Come out and Iook.

over there, right? We got everything here, okay?
you got the miIitia here.
let SaI come Iook. What hope have you got?
quit whiIe you're ahead.
it's onIy attempted robbery. -Armed robbery.
aII right, armed, then! Nobody's been hurt.
reiease the hostages. No one wiII worry over kidnapping charges.
at the most you'II get 5 years. You'II get out in 1.
what? -Kiss me.
when I'm being fucked, I Iike to get kissed on the mouth.
you're a city cop, right? Bank robbery's a federaI offense.
they got me on kidnapping, armed robbery. They'II bury me.
I won't taIk to somebody trying to con me. Get someone in charge.
I won't taIk to some fIunky pig trying to con me. What's he doing?
get back! -Why are they moving in?
wiII you get the fuck back there?
get over there!
go on back there, man!
he wants to kiII me so bad!
no one's going to kiII anybody. -Attica!

I don't know whether a heIicopter wouId fit in here or not.
I'II check it.

Yes.

no.
Fatima.
Fatima, wait.
Fatima, wait.
I want to meet him.
I told you, you can't.
has he called?
only to yell at me.
we should run away, just go.
we have our studies, Fatima.
we have to be realistic.
okay for you. No one's forcing you to marry.
I just want to meet him.
he has chosen someone for me.
he has chosen.
he might like me more.
you don't know my father.
daddy.
daddy, did I wake you?
no, sweetheart.
daddy, do you dream about me when you're sleeping?
I dream about you and your mother and your sister.
Fatima said you stop dreaming when you get married.
she's wrong, sweetheart.
you dream all your life.
it's one of God's gifts.
understand?
give me a kiss. - No.
one kiss. - No.
only one.
after Fawal, we have meetings with Saeed El-dalizi, Minister of Interior, Hamsa Reglori, the head of defense.
saeed's all right.
Reglori has a... a little bit of a solophist back-story...
but he knows which side he's on.
so, uh, this, uh, Fa-Fawal... What's his name?
Abasi Fawal. - Abasi Fawal.
so he's the hard guy? - Yeah. I... I've never met him.
you're the, uh, knuckle-dragger. I' the pen-pusher.
he'll be more your contact than mine.
they overload these donkeys and cause accidents. Chaos.
tea, please.
okay.
how long you been here?
five and a half months.
it's just on the other side of the square.
Ahmid, what's going on? - Accident, sir.
fucking traffic, man
out the back! Out the back!
Mr. Freeman.
I am sorry.
lee Mayers. - Lee, it's Douglas.
how's Dixon?
he's dead.
fuck. Where are you now?
at the hospital.
are you hurt? - No. I' fine.
all right, listen. You're gonna have to step up for a while.
fill in for Dixon. Report directly to me. Understood?
Yeah, I understand.
Douglas, are you okay?
Yeah.
Corrine Whitman.
Yes, it is.
all right, go ahead.
what's his condition?
has anybody contacted his wife yet?
no. I will do it.
any claim of responsibility? - What is it?
no. All right. I'm coming in.
what's happened?
suicide bombing over there, and they got one of us.
Jesus. It's 2: 00 A. M.
Yeah. Well, I' sure they arranged it...
just to spite you, honey.
so he's Egyptian with a green card?
okay. When's he land?
Uh-huh.
okay, do it.
I'm giving you the authorization.
welcome to Washington, d. C.
please follow the signs to U. S. Customs.
all arriving passengers must clear customs here before embarking on connecting flights.
please have your passports and customs declaration forms ready.
excuse me.
Mr. Anwar El-lbrahim? - Yes?
sir, we have an emergency message for you.
would you follow us, please? - What do you mean? What is it?
is it my wife? Is she all right? - I apologize, sir.
they don't give us any details.
I got it. - Okay, let's go.
19 dead, 75 injured.
El-Hazim have claimed responsibility.
and the new guy?
shrapnel in the neck.
he bled to death.
damn.
sir.
you have calls from Corrine Whitman, CIA...
and Mr. Davis at the U. S. State department.
give me Corrine first.
one dead American.
where am I?
rashid Salimi.
what?
rashid Salimi.
no, sir. My name is Anwar El-lbrahimi.
rashid is an Egyptian national who's claimed responsibility for today's terror attack.
what attack?
why don't you tell me?
look...
I don't know anything about any attack of any kind.
I've been on a plane from South Africa for 18 hours.
is this your phone?
it looks like mine. Why?
numbers match. - What numbers?
rashid has placed several calls to your phone over the last few months.
no, sir. I've never talked to anybody named Rashid.
what were you doing in Cape Town?
why am I shackled this way? I want to speak to a lawyer.
what were you doing in Cape Town?
attending a conference for chemical engineers.
I was invited by the South African Fossil Fuels Foundation.
who did you meet with?
list them.
can I call my wife?
no.
these are all well-regarded professionals in my industry.
are you familiar with bomb-making techniques?
what?
have you ever constructed a bomb?
this is ridiculous.
you've never constructed a bomb?
no, sir.
six years ago...
I, uh... I worked briefly on a study commissioned by the ATF.
nothing to do with bomb-making.
just detection, using trace paper technology.
you can check it out.
thank you.
we will.
the point is you have experience with explosives.
there were ten of us on that team.
it was for a government agency. Have you arrested them, too?
rashid Salimi.
I don't know anyone named Rashid!
where is he?
I don't know.
I' gonna call him.
you've reached Anwar. Please leave a message.
Hey, it's us. We're at Arrivals...
and we don't see you anywhere.
maybe we got the information wrong.
call me back when you get this. Okay, bye.
El-Hazim claimed responsibility within minutes of the attack.
the incident took place in a crowded square...
as residents were heading to work...
leaving nineteen dead and dozens more injured.
the fourth in a series of attacks the bombing has once again raised concerns that extremists are targeting governments...
I need everything we have on Al-Hazim Brigade. Okay?
I have been asked to fill in for Dixon...
until a replacement can be found.
uh, I need a work-up on Fawal.
uh, Abasi Fawal.
okay.
I need a shirt.
are you okay? - I need a shirt.
I need a shirt. I need... I need you to get me shirt...
okay. Okay. - Okay?
okay, I need a plain shirt...
not a... not a shirt with stripes. - Yes.
I know what a shirt is, Douglas. - Just a plain cotton shirt.
do you... do you know what I' talk... Okay. - Okay?
okay. Good. I need a shirt.
and l... I need a... I need, um... uh...
what? Gum?
uh, yeah. Yeah.
okay. Okay.
if Cape Town says he boarded and d. C. Says he didn't...
then one of them is wrong.
I' sorry, sir, but you cannot just get on a plane in one country and not get off in another.
now, you must have some record of him arriving or transferring to another airline.
Yes.
well, check again.
is he asleep?
he wants you to read to him.
can you do it? I' on hold.
did you speak to the hotel?
they said they dropped him off at the airport on time.
everything will be all right.
he probably just missed his connection.
he hasn't called.
Lina.
dad, when is Fatima coming home?
finish your milk.
please, Abasi.
tell her you made a mistake.
it's not the same as when we were young.
there are rules, Samia.
there are rules.
look at my sister Layla.
she'll never marry.
call her, Abasi.
please.
for me.
I have called.
I've left a dozen messages.
she doesn't answer.
what can I do?
leave the egg alone!
have you called your father?
not yet.
I' sorry.
don't worry, it's nothing.
what have I done?
I'm proud of you for standing up to him.
that's my taxi.
please stay.
I want you in this apartment by eight while I' gone.
if my brother knew I was leaving you here alone...
he'd kill me.
okay?
see you in a few days.
we think it was an attempt on Abasi Fawal.
Dixon was just wrong place, wrong time.
if they got one of us, that's a victory for them.
these are the latest of Rashid?
three months after he escaped the Jordanians.
they should've taken him out when they had the chance.
so without Dixon, who do we have?
Douglas Freeman, analyst.
degree in economics from Princeton.
started out as a junior exec in the oil business.
how long with us?
since September 12th, give or take.
Jesus. He looks 12 years old.
do you think he can do this?
he's smart. He's been getting close with the ministers of finance and interior.
he initiated the Madrasa charity investigation that, uh, brought in forty-four al Qaeda fundraisers. - Lee analyst is not a jackal.
we're spread thin.
did you polygraph the Egyptian?
Yeah. Came up clean.
polygraph doesn't mean diddly.
well, we always say that when they pass.
something funny?
we lost someone today.
I traced him with Interpol, Mossad, the Egyptians.
nobody's interested.
I'm interested.
okay.
what do you wanna do?
we can't hold him here indefinitely.
put him on the plane.
Yes, ma'am.
my grandma has the middle floor. I' on top.
I don't want her to find me here.
she's away for the week.
I have a back way in. No one will see us.
you okay?
my grandma's room.
come.
Jeremy, stop bouncing the ball.
you know you're not supposed to do that in the house.
why can't I come with you?
because you have school, and you have tryouts this week.
what's all this stuff?
these are my important papers, Jeremy.
I need you to get off the bed.
are you gonna see daddy?
Yeah.
why didn't he come home?
he just had to stay at work a little bit longer.
Jeremy, your food is on the table.
I wanna wait for Mommy.
I'll be down in just a second. Okay, honey?
go on.
sorry. I just... I have a copy of his green card...
but I can't find a copy of his passport anywhere. - Under my name.
who is this man you're going to see?
he's a friend from college.
he works for a senator.
like jasmine.
do you sell what you paint?
some.
I'm getting better.
no.
those are just drafts.
that's you?
Mm-hmm.
and them?
my brother and grandma.
this is your mother?
she was beautiful.
you are the beautiful one.
you and your brother have the same eyes.
Where's he now?
does he visit you?
no.
not anymore.
are you hungry?
come, let's go to the kitchen.
Saeed.
Ah, Douglas.
I thought today you might not come.
Yeah.
do you want a cigar? - No, thank you.
tea?
uh, please. Yeah.
do you guys have anything yet?
not yet. You?
no.
I got it.
you know, you have a new detainee on the way.
egyptian lives in America. He's a chemical engineer.
Yeah, I got the cable last night.
who's observing? - Me.
you're not a case officer, Douglas.
Nope.
maybe I can finally use my gun.
we've got 58 percent approval after your statement.
there's no reason for him to hide.
it's not the bill he's concerned about.
it's the attachment, Alan. - I know.
okay, there's a compromise here. - Yeah. Obviously.
this bill's gonna get crushed in committee if you guys don't get behind it.
yeah?
um, damn. I got to go.
I'll talk to the senator.
thank you. Thank him.
Izzy, you're here.
um... God, look at you.
you didn't tell me you're, like, a hundred months pregnant.
thank you for seeing me, Alan.
Yeah.
well, let's get you off your feet, all right?
okay. Yeah.
you look like you're about to pop.
uh, something to drink? Eat? Eat?
uh, no. Just a bottle of water would be great...
if you have that - Sam, can we get a couple of bottles of water?
Sam, lzzy. Izzy, Sam. - Hi.
we got Senator Lewis. - Bravo.
right. Am I walkin' too fast?
no, no, no. I'll get there eventually.
okay.
you've done well for yourself.
I always knew you would.
thank you.
so, uh, you married Anwar.
Yeah. - Yeah.
What'd your father say about that?
I' sure you can imagine.
Yeah.
thought about inviting you to the wedding.
I probably wouldn't have come.
I... I, um, brought some things that I thought might be helpful.
this is a copy of his Egyptian passport...
listen, lzzy. - And his green card.
my guy at INS, he got back to me...
and he assures me that Anwar never entered the United States.
the South Africans made a mistake. - I need youto take a look at this.
this is a copy of his most recent credit card charges.
he spent $70 on duty free during his flight to d. C.
he was on that plane, Alan.
No!
I've got Jim Alderman on the line.
Jim. Yeah, thanks for getting back to me.
listen. I' sitting on convincing evidence that El-lbrahim landed in d. C.
he purchased something in the in-flight duty free.
what did he say?
uh, nothing helpful.
Sam, can you get me a minute with the senator?
peace be with you. - And with you.
I thought you weren't coming.
come.
sir, he's here.
Douglas Freeman, Abasi Fawal.
uh, sorry about Mr. Dixon. Uh...
definitely, they were after me.
second time.
second time. Please.
drink, my friend.
no, thank you.
so Dixon was replacing Simms.
Yeah.
Yes. And now it's you.
now it's me. - Mm-hmm.
please.
almonds.
good. Very good.
um...
our questions.
of course. Thank you.
al Jazeera is running footage.
security authorities have confirmed 19 deaths.
most of the victims are women and children.
a tourist video found at the scene...
shows the source of the blast.
in an email to the station, El-Hazim has claimed...
why the hell didn't we get that?
call Abdou, I want a copy now.
so...
you're staying to observe.
I will ask your questions.
but there will be no suggestions, no interference while I work. Understood?
good.
the struggle against the Zionist and the Crusader represents the decisive battle between faith and infidelity.
between good and evil.
the destruction of the infidel and hypocrite is your sacred duty.
when you meet the Apostate you are commanded to "strike the necks."
the Crusader talks about freedom.
jihad is the only path to freedom.
do not fear their bullets.
what can they do but set your soul free?
on the day of Judgment...
when you stand before the Almighty God...
and he asks you...
why did you not fight for the cause of God?
and for the oppressed. The men, the women and the children?
what did you do with the one weapon I gave you?
your body.
what will be your answer?
will you display the wounds of martyrdom and walk through the gates of heaven?
or, will you hang your head in shame and roast in the fires of hell?
success is from God.
may the peace and blessings and glory of God, the Almighty, be upon you.
Amen.
Amen.
praise God.
God is great!
S-s-sir?
there's been some kind of mistake.
why have my clothes been taken from me?
I want my clothes.
no one has told me why I' here or... or what I've done.
l... This is crazy! I want my clothes!
and I want to speak to a lawyer immediately!
Yes. Yes, of course, you do.
I have just a few questions.
if you answer honestly, we can send you home.
sir.
sir. Are you American?
I've lived in the States for twenty years.
my wife is American.
her name is Isabella Fields El-lbrahimi.
if you just call her...
you are Egyptian. Yes?
you are Egyptian.
Yes. I was born in Egypt...
but I came to the States when I was fourteen years old.
I studied at NYU.
I got my mas... - Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I have it all here.
your English is beautiful.
what language do you speak with Rashid?
I don't know who that is.
I've never talked to anyone named Rashid.
so how do you explain these calls?
what? - Hmm?
uh, it must be a... a mistake.
maybe it's a mix-up.
my name is "El-lbrahim-ee."
but, um, sometimes people call me "El-lbrahim.
but it's "lbrahim-ee" with an "i.
with an "i." "lbrahim-ee." - So...
Yes. Very good.
rashid Salimi and one El-lbrahimi, with an "i.
don't tell me he didn't call you.
all this info, it's lies.
I don't know.
you never get calls from Egypt?
no.
Yes. I mean, yes. My... My family is in Egypt.
then they call you. - Of course, they call me.
of course. What about?
little things. Uh, family things.
like what? Like, uh...
um, like...
like my Uncle Yusef.
he called, asking if NYU is a good school for his... for my cousin.
Yusef who?
Yusef Abdul Hamid?
Yes.
where is he? - What?
your uncle.
where is your uncle?
Why?
why do you want to talk to my uncle?
my friend...
put yourself in our position.
a criminal named Rashid has been on a bombing campaign for two years.
in the last few months, suddenly his explosives are more sophisticated, more deadly.
you are an engineer. You have the chemical know-how.
we have direct calls to you from a number linked to Rashid.
what are we to think? You tell me.
what are we to think?
it's a mistake.
it's a mistake.
a mistake.
what if I were to tell you that we have a signed confession from one of Rashid's lieutenants that you have been aiding them for more than a year?
then... l'd say you were lying.
put him in the hole.
would you like some water?
come. I want to show you something.
they close the fool's hand around this pressure release trigger.
pull the pin.
it's like a hand grenade.
you let go, it detonates.
if the bomber changes his mind...
they have a shooter who will take him out.
the hand releases.
boom.
they make it like this...
with nails and bolts...
for maximum human damage.
this is what killed your friend Dixon.
the work we do is important, Douglas.
it is sacred.
we save lives.
Dixon wasn't my friend.
I let myself in.
Yeah.
do you mind? - No.
I gotta get cleaned up. - No, you don't.
come on.
I, uh...
Oh.
Douglas.
talk to me. What happened today?
it was a bad day.
what happened?
that's him.
you see?
heading right for me. The dog.
is someone trying to stop him?
wait, wait.
she's blocking him.
the gunshot...
useless.
is it a boy or a girl?
Oh, um...
we wanted to wait.
well, it sounds like a law-enforcement issue.
have you spoken to the FBI?
Yeah. They never heard of him.
hmm.
I-I-I don't know how I can help you on this one, Alan.
all right.
what's your involvement with this?
uh, she is an old friend.
she outside? - Mm-hmm.
uh, you want me to say hello. I mean, I'd rather not.
no, I'd rather you not.
I got a question.
shoot.
when the CIA decides to move someone covertly...
who gives the order for that?
Corrine Whitman.
right.
Thanks.
she comes in here once a week...
to brief the Senate Intelligence Committee.
now, Senator Hawkins is on that committee. Okay?
they have a relationship.
I need to be delicate...
so let me do the talking.
I don't want her to know you're in the room, okay?
okay. - Okay?
Yeah. - Izzy?
Yeah.
okay.
Corrine Whitman's office.
hello. Alan Smith, Senator Hawkins' office.
I need to speak with Ms. Whitman.
this is Todd Hamilton, Mrs. Whitman's executive assistant.
can I ask what this is about?
anwar El-lbrahim.
please hold.
Mr. Smith?
Yes.
I' sorry. Mrs. Whitman is not available.
generally, or to talk about Mr. El-lbrahim?
please submit your inquiry in writing to her office.
what does that mean?
CIA calls it "extraordinary rendition."
it started under Clinton.
the agency wanted to be able to move suspected terrorists...
without having to formally apply for extradition.
now, it's supposed to be used...
only under extraordinary circumstances.
but after 9/11, it took on a whole new life.
basically, the government has authorized the seizure and transfer of anyone they suspect of being involved in terrorism to secret prisons outside of the U. S.
Alan, Anwar is not a terrorist.
there's nothing extremist about him. - I know.
he coaches Jeremy's soccer team, for Christ sakes.
what do you mean prison?
okay, but there must be some reason why they would take him.
what reason?
did Anwar ever apply for U. S. Citizenship?
no. But why is that important?
he has a green card. He pays his taxes.
Alan, you know him.
in fairness, lzzy, I barely knew him.
you knew him.
okay.
what I' asking is that the FBI checks him out.
you have to promise me they're not gonna find anything unusual.
a meeting he might have attended, all right?
a friend or an acquaintance that's had some contact...
any contact with an extremist group.
uh, like a mosque he attends?
does he... does he even attend a mosque?
you knew him.
he hasn't changed.
okay. I know.
I had to ask.
where were you?
Fatima, what are you doing here?
I was worried.
you can't keep missing classes.
I was busy.
you were busy.
don't.
are you seeing another girl?
no.
then where were you?
with Omar. - Where?
at his home. He has a problem.
I am his friend.
friend.
I' sorry.
I have to go.
now?
stay here.
no.
please stay with me.
I' sorry.
Hello?
Hi.
what did your friend say?
he's talking to somebody very high up.
he said she probably knows something.
Nuru?
yes?
there's nothing I don't know, is there?
what do you mean?
I mean, back in Egypt when...
when he was younger.
there's nobody he would've known there with...
what?
nothing.
I' sorry. - Isabella.
I think maybe you should come home...
before you put the baby at risk.
we can do things from here. - So tired.
why did Rashid call you?
why did Rashid call you?
give him an answer, Anwar.
give him an answer.
leave us.
what are you doing?
it's not working.
he's not giving us any answers.
if he gives no answer...
then that's the answer you put in your report.
he gave no answer.
let me talk to him.
I wanna talk to him.
ten minutes.
are you the American?
Uh-huh.
why are you here?
just explain the phone calls, and we can all go home.
was it possible? Could I have killed someone?
was it even me?
Eddie? This is Melissa.
listen, Vernon hasn't been giving you anything, has he?
because that stuff is dangerous.
Melissa?
Melissa, hey, do you think that we can meet somewhere?
I really need to talk to you, We're talking now.
no, no, let's meet at, uh...
Billy's on Grant at noon?
you can't see me, Eddie. No, no...
Eddie, please. Please, please come, please come, I...
it's important, I really need to know what you're talking about,
I realized that there were other people who might know about NZT.
Vernon's other clients.
Hi. Yeah, hi, may I please speak with Jerry Brady?
Jerry's in the hospital. He's what?
Yeah, he's not doing well at all.
Yeah, hello, is Paul Kaplan there? Uh, no. No, he's not.
uh, Paul passed away three days ago.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry,
Yeah, he started getting headaches, then he collapsed at work.
now he's in the ICU.
OK, please give him my best, Thank you,
of all the people I called... three were dead and the rest were sick.
Hello? Hello?
watch it, man!
did you see that?
Hey!
go! Go!
Eddie,
Melissa,
Hey,
don't tell me I look good, 'cause I know,
I didn't want you to see me this way,
you look good,
Oh, I, uh...
Yeah, I sorta got myself together,
NZT will do that to you,
what do you mean? I mean, I took it, too,
Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?
no,
well, when he told me about this amazing new drug,
I was like, down the hatch, And it was, It was amazing,
I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes and I understood it,
my work rate increased just insanely overnight and my boss started to hate me,
they offered me his job and then... and then I got scared,
Why? Why? Because I'm not stupid,
nobody can operate at that level of mental activity and not crash,
I stopped taking it,
And? And I got sick, Headaches,
throwing up, So I went back to Vernon,
he told me about all the people that were dying,
how much have you been taking, Eddie?
I've been taking a lot,
well, maybe... maybe they've worked out the bugs, Maybe...
maybe this is a different batch,
Yeah, You're off it right now, aren't you?
just finish your story, ...I didn't take any more and I didn't die,
but after a while, I realized I couldn't concentrate on anything for longer than ten minutes,
I, uh... I missed deadlines, got lazy, slow, so slow,
that was two years ago,
and I haven't been the same since,
do you have some left? Good,
you go home and you take it,
you take the dose down, but you don't just stop,
you'll die if you just stop,
try to taper off, otherwise the headaches are just the beginning,
I have to go,
do you know who makes it? I don't know,
I have to go,
Oh, shit, Listen, listen, listen, Listen, listen, listen... OK,
you forget about me, huh? No, no, no, no, 12: 00 and you're not here,
I'm here now, Oh! Good,
come on, get going, I could write you a check,
check, Check, Are you out of your mind?
what do you think I am? Some financial institution?
all right, You're right, Look, we just need to go to a bank...
what do you got there?
what is it? No, it's just aspirin,
don't look like no aspirin I ever see, It's something good, huh?
I feel good, man, What's in this stuff?
it's just, uh, vitamins and aspirin,
you full of shit, Eddie baby,
lindy, I wouldn't have let him in, but...
I'm sorry... Tyler, I gotta go,
I'm sick,
I shouldn't... I'm sorry, I couldn't make it home,
let's get you to a hospital, No, no, no, no, no, I don't need...
I need you to get...
it's really simple, babe, I need my pills,
Eddie, what pills? I don't... Babe, it's complicated,
what are you taking? Are you on drugs?
they're... it's...
I had no choice. I told Lindy everything.
so all this energy of yours, all this focus...
...has been a drug,
well, it was supposed to be legal,
I have a... a supply stashed,
you want me to go get it,
no, No, no, no, I'm gonna go get it, Give me your keys,
I'll go to your apartment,
it's not... in my apartment, I moved it,
OK, so where did you move it?
in my house,
unbelievable,
Hey, have you got it?
Yeah,
there's someone following me,
are you sure?
Yeah, He got into the cab behind me and he's making every turn I'm making,
baby, call the cops, Can you go around him?
babe, what's happening?
we're stopped dead,
he's getting out,
Eddie, he's walking over here,
Lindy?
Oh, God!
help! Help!
this man's... This man's chasing me!
he followed me from my building, I don't know him,
please! Yo, buddy, let's leave her alone!
are you deaf? I said leave her alone,
Hey, buddy, are you trying to piss me off?
what are you doing, man?
are you still there? Yeah, I'm here, What happened?
I'm stuck, He'll find me,
OK, stop talking. Don't move.
he killed two guys. What?
he's gonna kill me, too, No, no, no...
can he see you?
no,
not yet,
I don't know what to do,
OK, I need you to go into the bag and take one of the pills,
Why?
because you'll know what to do. You'll take it and then you'll know.
he's got a knife, Eddie, I can't think my way out of a knife,
just listen to me, It'll come on in 30 seconds,
and you'll think your way out, That's what it does,
he's getting closer,
lindy, I love you,
Hey!
now turn to me...
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ah! Daddy!
Eddie, Here,
it's gonna be OK,
we've got to get out of here, Eddie?
you OK?
Yeah,
I'm so sorry about what happened,
I want you to know that you never, ever have to go through that again, 'cause I can take care of us now,
I'm sure you can,
I can make us safe, I'm back, OK?
who's back, Eddie? Me,
no, It's not you,
you were different before, I'm still the same person, Lin,
I wasn't, when I was on it,
I did things I would never do,
those things saved your life, But they weren't me,
Yes, they were, No, the way it works...
I know how it works, I get it,
I totally get it, You feel invincible,
where it will take us, Lin, you can't even imagine,
the things we'll be able to do, Where we'll be a year from now,
the kind of life that we'll finally be able to live,
well, you might have to live it without me,
look, I am gonna stop taking it, There's just some things I have to do to keep us safe and that... To set us up and then I'm gonna get off it,
I mean, that's the plan, Eddie...
look, I have a plan, I swear,
I'm gonna get off it,
OK,
I hope you do,
looking for me?
you think you can run out on me, huh?
you think I don't know where you are?
I was under the impression our business was settled,
I want some more of that stuff,
or I shoot you right here, Take your pick,
this guy was not going away.
a few pills would buy me some time.
there it is, We're done, Oh, yeah, We'll see,
until I found a more... permanent solution.
unless you see a real threat,
I never want it known that I have any security,
you'll never precede me, you'll always follow me,
never more than 15 steps behind, And never stand too close together,
I want to able to look behind me if the opportunity presents itself,
and don't wear the same color suit, This isn't The Matrix.
you have to know, Eddie, I wrote you off,
I was sick, You don't get sick,
you're playing at this level, you get hit by a car, you don't even die,
you're absolutely right, I know I'm right,
I mean, I didn't know who or what I was talking to,
a hundred and five, That's who you were talking to, Carl, Delirium,
Mm-hm,
I sent over my revised projections,
I didn't ask for your projections,
I know, but I think if you take a look at them...
I already have, As a matter of fact...
...I fired a few people over your projections,
I'm sorry, No, you're not,
you're relieved that you know things my team missed,
the minute, the instant that's no longer true...
two months after I'd started NZT,
I was brokering the biggest merger in corporate history.
ironically, it's gonna be crude,
crude is gonna be where we're gonna hit them,
which yields a prospective profit of 200 percent,
that makes both of us very happy campers,
I found that if I maintained an even dose, remembered to eat, drank no alcohol, the blackouts didn't recur. How you doing, Eddie?
Tom, is it possible to construct an imperceptible compartment?
in this jacket?
in all of them, Certainly, sir,
safer though my stash now was,
I was not sitting around until it ran out.
can I combine these ingredients in the same exact quantity, yes, but, the exact method of delivery to the brain... Darts at a dartboard,
Meaning? Clinical trials, guinea pig people,
that's gonna take too long, It's what it is,
or you'll kill people, You need 12, to 18 months...
I'll give you two million dollars if you can do it in six,
I found that we can cut costs 30 percent and, um...
excuse me one second,
I thought we straightened this out, Detective,
this isn't about Vernon Gant, Mr. Morra,
what is this about?
the witness identified the Maria Winberg suspect as this person,
wanna tell me your whereabouts the night of April 2nd?
I couldn't keep this quiet on my own.
enter Morris Brandt... the most lethal lawyer in New York.
you're lucky somebody wiped the room,
it's weak, Circumstantial at best,
just between us, were you there?
I don't remember,
I don't want to make concessions to you...
Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood had no idea I might soon be charged with murder.
but SyCorps, Andine and others are jockeying for the same industrial concessions in Libya that both our companies are pretending we're not sniffing out,
how do you know this?
the governmental bribe system is itself corrupt, so, of course, information about its inner workings, like anything, can be bought,
go on,
if you take a look at the lower left-hand column, in 2008, five companies were jockeying for a position before we even took notice,
Jesus, he looks frail,
could be an act, He's not even 60,
so, have you decided, Eddie? What are you gonna do?
when this is over? I don't know,
you haven't given me the answer,
you haven't asked the question,
well, given the scale of my contribution, let's say 45,
done, Forty-five thousand dollars,
forty million is plenty, Eddie,
there's a lot more where that came from,
you know, Eddie...
...it may be on your mind that you're not gonna continue to work for me anymore,
this has been the learning experience of my life,
I hope it has, I hope you don't think you've gotten enough from me,
on to the next,
well, in order for a career to evolve, I'm gonna have to move on,
that you would even think that would only show me how unprepared you are to be on your own,
I mean, you do know you're a freak,
your deductive powers are a gift from God, or chance, or a stray shot of sperm, or whatever, or whoever the hell wrote your life script, a gift not earned,
you do not know what I know because you have not earned those powers,
you're careless with those powers,
you flaunt them and you throw them around like a brat with his trust fund,
you haven't had to climb up all the greasy little rungs,
you haven't been bored blind at the fundraisers,
you haven't done the time in that first marriage to the girl with the right father,
you think you can leap over all in a single bound,
you haven't had to bribe or charm or threaten your way to a seat at that table,
you don't know how to assess your competition because you haven't competed, Don't make me your competition,
now, I'll open up a line of credit for you,
you'll be wanting a few toys,
hotel rooms were no longer an option.
what I needed was a bunker.
there's a built-in safe, central surveillance, vault grade pneumatic doors.
it's an unparalleled three-tier security system,
a fortress with a hell of a view,
what's the asking price? Eight-point-five,
I'll take it,
right away, it was obvious he was on NZT.
next week, I'm gonna need 20 pills,
next week, you can go fuck yourself!
not that you'd feel anything,
I don't think your Fortune 500 financial friends would appreciate the details of your little dilemma with the police,
thursday, I'm gonna need the pills here,
getting smarter!
obviously, this could not go on, but there is very little on this earth that 40 million dollars can't solve.
and tomorrow at nine, Atwood would sign the papers.
do you want to call it? Cold feet?
there was all last night to tell us that,
anything? I'll call him again, sir.
OK, the decision could have changed, That makes sense,
the discourtesy doesn't, It's still on,
Oh, based on your charts and projections,
you know, remind me, who the fuck are you, anyway?
I'm sorry, Carl,
I've had it with this unqualified, posturing little prick,
pull it back, Since when is this the Delphic Oracle?
pull it back, Excuse me, Mr. Van Loon?
Mrs. Atwood is in your office,
Ah, Mrs. Atwood, Carl Van Loon,
my associate, Edward Morra, Pleasure,
I wanted to make this as confidential as possible,
of course,
my husband experienced some pain and dizziness this morning,
he's currently at Lenox Hill, undergoing tests,
I just want you to know we have every intention of signing the contract,
and as soon as he is able, we will proceed,
I realize this is a useless platitude, but if there's anything that we can do, please don't hesitate to tell us,
obviously, we want to be as helpful and respectful as possible, Mrs. Atwood,
thank you, gentlemen, I rely on your discretion,
there won't be a proxy,
no, a cagey prick like him giving away power of attorney?
well, he'd better get better,
but Atwood wouldn't get better. Because Atwood was out of NZT.
well, why be surprised?
how many other meteoric rises might be explained by NZT?
at least I had some.
my life wasn't in jeopardy. You can wait here,
only my money. And my liberty.
I've been all over with them,
we can't allow any disparity in race or physical type between you and the rest of the line up,
OK,
they're as close to your clones as I could possibly get,
it's gotta be just one big handsome blur to this guy.
who was out there?
the woman's husband?
a hotel maid?
was this how it was all going to end?
not the dimmest clue, He was dithering, "He was the third one from the right, No, Not him,
there you go, It's a thing of beauty, You have that made?
I did, ...market's been mixed today.
the Dow has been yo-yoing amidst speculation that
van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger...
have you been talking to anyone?
no, I haven't been talking to anybody, Carl, I'm not stupid,
I know you're not stupid, Eddie, but don't make the classic smart person's mistake,
thinking no one's smarter than you,
where the hell have you been?
this is the second time you've turned to vapor,
I was in the building, I was getting coffee,
why, has there been movement?
Yeah, there's been movement alright, Atwood's in a coma,
he wasn't playing us, He's dying,
what do you know about this?
I was less than usually equipped to answer.
the dullness was coming on. I was overdue to take my NZT.
and the pain was starting behind my eyes.
excuse me,
you're not excused,
what? A man in your employ can't take a piss, Carl?
was it Brandt or someone else?
the police station? A coatroom?
Mr. Morra,
Carl, I'm sorry... Mr. Morra, Mr. Morra!
this just came for you, Yeah, what?
hope not, so let me know when you know,
all right, I'm gonna ask you again, Eddie,
what do you know about this?
what? About the leak? No, About Atwood,
what? What about Atwood?
look, you got a long way to go as a liar, kiddo,
Carl, I don't know what you're... Listen!
what you're about to say is bullshit,
I know there's something you're hiding from me,
I smell it on you, Right now,
I wanna know why this clusterfuck of a deal is dead in the water!
Carl,
Eddie! Eddie!
outside Lenox Hill Hospital today, more twists and turns in the Van Loon-Atwood merger.
there is absolutely no truth to the rumor of this merger.
none whatsoever. My husband is having tests.
this is a difficult time.
we would appreciate your directing further questions to our attorney.
Yes, we have no further comments at this time.
we're just awaiting the results of the latest round of tests and hoping for the best.
thank you.
Eddie, I know you're in there, Eddie,
open up,
come on,
open the door,
and so, here I am.
I knew they would kill me slowly and horribly.
but this choice would at least be mine.
but we're instinctive creatures. We want to live.
so my foggy brain tried to remember where one tablet of NZT might be.
it was possible. And possible was enough.
Hey, Eddie,
now you know I want more, so why would you upset me?
I don't like being down to this last one,
you don't even know how to use it,
you don't appreciate it,
you see, I dissolve in a solution,
you shoot it, It goes straight into the blood and brain,
lasts much longer,
so...
you gonna tell me where the rest is?
I'm plumb out,
go look.
you know, these guys are gonna find it,
or I'm gonna make you tell me,
question is, which is gonna come first?
I guess we're gonna find out, huh?
this is a waste of my time, you know?
I'm getting out of this side of the business,
I'm branching out, I'm starting import-export company,
very exciting stuff,
I got a lot on my plate, You're lucky I'm here,
there's a safe.
back in the old times, I might peel your skin back, Fillet you, "Fillet," It's a nice word,
I didn't know this before, Oh, I had such a poor vocabulary,
but then I discovered this thing, Google,
did you know the small and large intestines is 20 foot long?
I had no idea, I don't believe it,
I gotta see this for myself, I'm dubious, It's another nice word,
anyway, I'm sure you're curious, too,
don't worry, everything's sterilized,
we're gonna keep you alive for the whole shebang,
you're gonna get a front row seat, Eddie,
what?
not much of a triumph, was it?
because I would die here, too.
only NZT could help me and the last of it was in this fuck's blood stream.
Victor!
what?
Hey!
I can't see.
on your right, shoot him.
Victor?
Victor?
Victor?
the police would later note that my apartment's previous owner was an arms dealer.
of course, these intruders had been his dissatisfied clients.
and the night was still young.
I'm sure you're curious about what happened to your boss,
I know I certainly am,
I mean, if my attorney was really working for Mr. Atwood, trying to save his life, why is he dead?
I mean, at what point was the pony express supposed to ride in with his life-saving medication?
his boss was dead.
so, I didn't matter now.
but he did not appreciate that Morris Brandt had kept the pills for himself.
and it was all still possible.
twelve MONTHS LATER
actually, no, there's no more tickets,
Yeah, I know, An overbooked fundraiser, That's a first,
well, here he comes, I'll ask him,
Oh, that's much better,
great job, Thank you, sir,
Hi, Mr. Morra,
Edward!
I think we're looking at a second overflow event,
there's a wave of donations coming in and I don't think they're even gonna try a second debate,
great. Hold on,
a guy from Eiben-Chemcorp's in your office,
I have a lunch, They're your biggest contributor,
give him his two crappy little minutes,
Eiben-Chemcorp Pharmaceuticals? Yeah,
finally get to meet the guys that keep the lights on,
Carl! Mr. Morra,
what a surprise, They told me somebody from Eiben was coming,
Chemcorp, Yeah, that's me now,
I'm moving out of the energy business,
come on, That's like Hef moving out of the mansion,
Yeah, I bought Eiben a couple of months ago,
I'm surprised you didn't hear,
no, No, Well, they really keep me hopping here,
well, it's gonna pay off, Senator Morra,
the Senate, Who knows...
everything's a technicality from here on in, isn't it, Eddie?
I think we both know where it's headed, if you can maintain,
have you asked yourself what you're gonna do when you run out?
when did you know? Does it matter? I know now,
I wish you'd come to me at first, Eddie,
I could have bought Eiben at 33 a share,
we could have been partners,
so, Eiben makes NZT,
well, it'll never officially exist,
obviously, I don't need to point out the advantages for you,
Oh, I think maybe you do,
limitless supply, We know you can't get any more,
you sure about that?
they shut down your lab this morning,
Eddie, I just want to help you, that's all,
keep you supplied, No disruption in service,
give you peace of mind, That's all,
and in return, I do what?
get a little advice, maybe, I won't be bothering you much at first,
and later, What are you gonna be bothering me with?
well, given where you're heading, some of our ideas are a bit ambitious,
but hey, I think they're achievable,
and what if I don't like your ideas?
then we'll say, "Godspeed,
and your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely light,
but you know what, Eddie, let's not even go there right now,
right now, I just want to keep you brilliant...
...and healthy, Come on, Let's go get some lunch,
after you, Senator,
thanks for stopping by, Carl,
give us a second,
what are you doing? Do you want to be President of the United States or brain dead, stuck full of tubes? I'll take my chances,
I told you your chances don't exist, We shut down your lab,
you don't think some smartass on NZT might have two or three or even four labs?
so what? You're not making any more,
that's right, I'm not,
I thought better of it, See, once you know what's in it, you can tweak it, re-engineer it, Get the bugs out, Taper off,
I'm off it, Carl,
well, on it or off it, there's no scenario where you're not working for me,
how you gonna pay me? In cigarettes?
last year you traded inside information 17 times, You threatening me?
blank checks from Dubai, Dumping in Chile,
disappeared officials,
I mean, you shed a spot light...
do you want to go to war with me?
and trust me when I say this, I'm not even being creative,
there's no way you can be making accusations like that and be walking around alive,
that you would even think that shows me how unprepared you are to fight me,
you're no longer equipped to fight me,
I may be off it, but you think I didn't learn anything?
that my synapses didn't change?
that I kept absolutely nothing?
you have no idea what kind of enemy I can be,
that van's gonna rear-end that taxi, What?
the driver's distracted, He's texting, He's going 30 miles an hour,
he has 60 feet to stop, He doesn't have room,
what van?
I see everything, Carl,
I'm 50 moves ahead of you and everybody else,
what makes you think I don't have a guy with a bead on you right now?
how do you know you're gonna be alive this time next year?
what are you doing? You get your hands off me, What are you doing?
something's pumping half-mass in there,
the walls of your heart are dilated,
your aortic valve's steno, So you're gonna need to get that replaced,
but you already knew that,
you know, you should really be glad about this, 'Cause me working for you? You'd end up as my bitch,
maybe we should cool off, Talk again,
I don't think so,
don't forget to vote,
Edward,
you good?
Yeah, Told you I have a lunch,
sorry I'm late, Hey, Don't worry,
how's your day going? Ah, I've had better,
I still can't deal with that haircut,
I wouldn't even recognize you on the street,
well, I'm a new man,
I've already ordered,
what?
that's me.
that's my dad.
I remember that day.
and believe it or not, I remember that hit.
I remember it because of the smile that spread over my dad's face.
Yeah, I'd have stood there all day just to sink one.
just to see that smile.
you see, to Pop, sports were a religion.
to me, it was about purity.
sports was a place where all wrongs could be made right.
I thought if I filled the whole house with trophies for him, he 'd stick around.
well, I did.
he left before my tenth birthday.
the Championship has come down to this final play.
the Sun Devils trail by four. The ball on the Aztec 15.
seven seconds left on the clock.
settle it down. Pro-right tiger. This is your game.
now, let's go. Let's go get 'em. Now, let's go! Let's go!
sun Devils' ball. First down and ten yards to go.
here we go, men, last play. It's fun time!
Pro-right tiger. Wide check. 532 double fly on two, Scottie. Guaranteed TD.
we gotta worry about one thing, men.
after we win this game they'll be putting cameras in your faces.
don't give them "Hi, Mom"s and shit. It's overused.
you gotta thank somebody, thank me.
I'll see you in the end zone, men. Ready? - Break!
I was a quarterback since peewee football
set high-school records, won state championships. This was perfect.
coming at you, 57.
bowl game, national TV, there were pro scouts in the stands, and I knew exactly what was gonna happen next.
lang has led the Sun Devils to four comebacks this season.
can he do it? Win their first bowl game in 12 years?
lang barks the signals. The Aztecs have eight in the box. They're showing blitz.
lang takes the snap, fades back into the pocket.
he looks for Ravis on the right. Sherman breaks through.
lang 's in trouble. He shakes Sherman off, nearly goes down.
he 's looking to throw. Two seconds to go. There he goes. He 's going to run it.
he 's got to get in the end zone. And that safety is stepping up.
can he make it?
Touchdown! - Argh!
my first thought was I could tape it and play next week. Then I puked.
when do I play again, Doc? What's the rehab time?
I'm not sure, son.
football wasn't a sport.
it was my life.
and I wasn't gonna give up now.
I would play again.
in the meantime I needed a job to hold me over between tryouts.
then one day, and it didn 't take long, six years had passed and I woke up at the bottom.
you have reached the Jessica Simpson hotline.
Jessica will tell you about Nick's birthday party, and a whole lot more about her rocking new panty line at Wal-Mart.
but first here's a little fan trivia to win a VlP gold-package backstage pass "to Jessica's Omnicon Hotel summer tour."'
Lang. - "The question..."' I'm taping, boss.
look. I got a job for you. Bauer's sick. I can't update his betting line.
you know anything about sports? - Yeah, a little.
900 numbers, audio text. The racket had a lot of names.
this guy's gig was sports handicapping - predicting winners for people who bet.
I was supposed to just record his picks.
thing was, I didn 't agree with them.
no, they're not.
living in Las Vegas, it was easy to gauge the temperature of the betting public.
the problem is they're usually wrong.
what's up, Stu? Where's all the action this weekend?
Tampa-Oakland. Everyone's jumping on Oakland.
that's crazy. - You think?
Yeah, man. That game's gonna be won by coaching.
Gruden put that Oakland team together before he came to Tampa.
he knows every strength and weakness.
brown catches to his left, so he'll have him double-teamed to the defender's right.
Gannon throws on a three-step drop.
he'll stack the midfield with line backers, take away the short pass.
Gannon will throw three or four NT s Sunday.
fuck me.
you took Oaktown? - Yeah, what do you think?
I think I gotta save your ass one more time.
take Tampa Bay on the money line. They're gonna win this game outright.
bet 'em big. - Thanks, B.
Stu did bet 'em big, and he won ten grand.
I was quickly becoming the biggest 900 line in Vegas.
Kansas City is seven to one against point spread v division opponents coming off a Monday night game. T ake KC minus the six.
call tomorrow for my pro-football game of the year. That's here at 900-656-3100.
until then, this is Brandon Lang saying good night and good gambling.
big plans this weekend?
there you go.
Steve. I went nine and two on pro football Sunday, and hit my third straight Monday-night parlay.
it's worth 12 bucks an hour. - Hey, I don't make 12 an hour.
you're not picking 75%.
if you're that good, why don't you bet your own games, get rich?
send me a postcard from the Riviera.
what's going on, Denny?
Hey, man. What's up?
big bro's making them greenbacks. How about you, bro?
I scrounged up some old headers, B. Check it out. Fire it up.
all right, here goes.
jeez, I'm late. Honey, dinner's in the oven. Where the hell's my lucky crucifix?
you just went there for your tryout last week.
another rejection letter. strength of your knee in question.
I only had two Arena teams left, and after that there was always the CFL.
~ You can 't save me ~ You can 't change me ~ Well, I'm waiting for my wake-up call ~ And everything, everything 's my fault.
Whoa! So what do you think?
should I ride shotgun or do you want to hop on the handlebars?
Hey, the packaging's not that great, but there's a prize on the inside.
what do you say? No?
Oh, that's OK.
you'll be back. I'll have a life.
~ Well, I'm waiting for my wake-up call ~ And everything's my fault.
good morning, Mary.
this is Brandon.
congratulations, you went nine and two last Sunday. This is Walter Abrams.
I don't know if you know me. I run the biggest sports service in the country, and I'm a big fan of yours, Brandon.
as a matter of fact, I've got a poster of you on my wall.
this is a joke, right? - No, this is not a joke. This is a job offer.
in your top drawer - go ahead, open it up , there 's an envelope with your name on it.
now, that's travel cash and an airline ticket. It's not a magic trick, Brandon.
I paid someone to put it there, who told me that the place you 're in reminded him of a Turkish prison.
now, all I'm asking you to do is come up with a number.
you write down the number of what you make now, you cross it out, you write what you should be making, and then toss in how much it's gonna take to get you to fly to New York first-class and come work for me.
now, focus, Brandon, focus.
with your bum knee, a comeback is just a dream. My offer is real.
run the numbers, do the math.
hold on a second. Yeah.
mom holding two jobs, Denny going to college, this looked like a chance to make some real money.
and besides, I'd never seen New York and New York had never seen me.
Oh, goodness. Hey.
all right.
so what's this guy Walter like? How long have you been working for him?
a long time.
two weeks. - Two weeks.
every day with Walter's an adventure.
~ Super cool, super mean ~ Feelin' good for the man, superfly, here I stand ~ Secret stash, heavy bread, baddest bitches in the bed ~ I'm your pusherman ~ I'm your pusherman.
that's OK.
all right, double it. Triple it.
no, everything's about money.
listen, this Sunday my little girl, an angel, turns six.
this is not likely to happen again.
she loves elephants. Your circus has ten. I only need one.
now, my little girl's happiness is in your hands.
I don't need advice from a guy who doubles as a clown.
I need a fucking elephant. Now, I'm willing to pay.
what'll it take to grease your wheels and get one here this weekend? Hello?
fuckwad!
find Ringling Brothers. Get someone who understands profit. Whoa!
the Marlboro man here.
nice to meet you. - Hey, you're in great shape.
I've been in better. - You're modest too. Oh!
modesty - not a virtue. Could be a vice. Sit down.
there are rules to success, my friend.
rule number one is know what you know, know what you don't know, and know that I gotta know everything you know as soon as you know it.
sooner. - Yes, sir.
you ever sell before? - No.
are you religious? - I believe in God.
Hey, Liz.
this is me 30 years ago, right? It's remarkable the resemblance.
I mean, he's a little taller. I'll give him that.
Oh, boy, you know, I'm not supposed to do this. It's bad for my condition.
nobody knows this, Liz, OK?
so before I die...
did you do anything other than sports phone in Vegas?
just the 900 recordings, you know, 10 bucks a call.
that's chump change.
I mean, we're going after much bigger fish here.
you know, networks don't talk about it, government can't tax it, but sports betting is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year business.
whoa. - Yeah.
a lot of gamblers out there, man, and they have needs.
and come Monday morning after a losing weekend, they got big needs. Gargantuan.
see that? That's every football game played last Sunday.
you know why Monday-night football's the most watched game of the week?
monday's the last chance bettors have to climb out of the hole they got in to pay their bookies on Tuesday.
sports betting's illegal in 49 states, including this one.
but what we do is not.
we are 100% legal, like stockbrokers, only instead of counting stocks, we advise people on how to bet.
now, if a client wins by taking our advice, we get a percentage, or we ask for one, which they will gladly give us because they want to keep getting the advice.
but if they lose, we get zip.
so the object here, my dear, tall, athletic, religious friend, is to win.
I can do that.
hello. This is Walter... - Hello, Walter.
that's my cable show.
now, after a nice five-day vacation on my yacht airs Saturday and Sunday morning nationwide.
we tape Thursday and Fri...
what's going on with my hair?
he did it again, Liz.
I got one part of my head in Cleveland, the other's in Chicago.
what are we gonna do with this guy? My barber. Should be shot. I want him dead.
for the first time,I'm gonna release our three-team college and pro parlays absolutely free.
if all the picks are free, how'd you get the yacht?
there's no yacht.
next question.
why give any picks for free? Why not charge a fee up-front initially?
you make a good point. Next.
what's on the second floor?
that's where we print the money.
anything else? - Of course not.
no, I think I've got it. I think everything's crystal clear, Walter.
I like you, you know that? You and me - this thing's gonna work.
I'm looking forward to it. - Me too.
Ringling Brothers on one.
tell them to hold that elephant. You ever have a manicure?
there's a girl you gotta meet.
yeah? What's she like? - She's beautiful. You're gonna like her.
is this Barnum or Bailey?
I've got it. - He's all yours.
Brandon? - Yeah.
Hi. I'm Toni. - Nice to meet you.
Walter said you'd stop by.
this was his idea. - Yeah, I know.
does he make all of his employees do this?
Yep. Every one. - How often?
once. Before they start work.
weird. - You think?
I never had my nails done before.
Yeah, I can see that, but you've got strong hands. That's nice.
do you drink?
excuse me?
alcohol. Are you a drinker? - I have a beer every once in a while.
do you smoke? - No.
what about gambling? - What about it?
I'm sorry. I'm just a bit pressed for time.
I asked, do you bet? Are you a bettor? - No.
Really?
why not?
Toni, huh?
are you here full time? - Yeah, no this is my shop. I better be.
so why don't you gamble?
well, I did once. I wagered everything I had and I lost.
so?
I just swore I'd never do it again.
you're sticking to that story? - Yeah.
I'm not gonna start this relationship off by lying.
that's good. Walter could definitely use someone with a little resolve in his life.
Hey, Toni.
would you have dinner with me tonight?
what do you say?
he didn't tell you. - Tell me what?
Brandon, Walter and I are married.
Oh. Oh, bogey. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. Listen.
he said to come to meet a nice lady...
I'm sure he did. That's OK. I'll kill him when I get home.
he has a big, bright, beautiful spirit, though, and you will love working for him.
but he is held together by meetings.
if it has "anonymous" at the end, he goes. He has to.
he also has to be careful who he lets into his life.
most ways, Walter's brilliant, but he can be bullshitted and I can't.
he sends them to me before hiring them.
so this was my interview. - Oh, you're swift.
how'd I do?
except for an illegal forward pass, perfect. Congratulations.
thank you very much.
1 -800, bet on it. Absolutely free.
this is the first floor, and it's all yours.
the TV's satellite, and it swivels.
your bedroom.
you know what this is? Looks like weights to me.
Yeah, baby.
now, I'm gonna put your copy here on your desk.
Walter, this is sweet ass.
a man's chair. - That's what I'm talking about.
OK. I'm gonna start you on the 900 numbers. Same gig you had in Vegas.
make your picks, record them each day. Monday through Friday, once a day.
five times a day on a weekend. - Mm-hm.
each call's worth 25 bucks a shot.
now, we're doing about three dozen hits a week. That's nothing.
we should triple that.
now, before you get into your test copy here, I got a few words for you.
your pitch sucks. No offence.
but you got potential, so we gotta find a way to bust you out.
bust me out? - Yeah.
we're gonna start by giving you a new name.
John Anthony. Just came to me.
John Anthony, the million-dollar man.
what's wrong with Brandon Lang?
nothing's wrong with Brandon Lang. It's just that he's still living with his mommy.
John Anthony's living large.
he don't hold back. He's got a direct line to God.
and for a measly 25 bucks a call, he's gonna let the world's losers listen in.
Hello, sports fans.
this is John Anthony in the Big Apple with my big-money picks.
the action starts Saturday with college ball, and our first match-up is Michigan against lndiana.
I already hung up.
John Anthony here, ready to make all your betting dreams come true.
that's right. Call me right now and let me win for you.
the point spread in the Indiana-Michigan game is at...
I think it's all right. - Wrong.
Mm-hm.
OK, what's your sales pitch?
my sales pitch is I'm picking 80% winners.
stats is not enough.
I'm telling you, you need a voice.
these are gamblers ready to risk what they can't afford for what they can't have.
you're selling the world's rarest commodity.
you're selling certainty in an uncertain world.
John Anthony here, the million-dollar man.
wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood. All your big money stays and plays with me.
sit back and relax. It's a Scud attack this weekend. I am shelling your bookmaker.
follow his block and cut to the right. Going in, Liz. Going in.
that's it, isn't it? Huh?
it's a start. - It's a start?
what can I tell you?
that's not what you want, then you need to find somebody else to sell and let me just pick.
it's not about what I want.
you understand? It's about what Brandon wants.
if I hear that, I'm calling this number.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy. Easy, easy.
what is it? What is it? What is it?
Shh.
should I call somebody?
not unless they got a spare heart.
Shh.
Oh, it's a small one. It's a teeny one.
breathe it out.
what do you need? Some water? - I'll be all right.
Oh, I know what I want.
I know what I want.
be a good boy and get me a light. Right there.
what are you doing?
courage wants to laugh.
he makes the snap, looks right, he throws.
phillips in for the touchdown!
clearly in the defense that does not give up the big plays.
23 over West Virginia. Pittsburgh on a 47-yard field goal
ieads Virginia 10-7.
north Carolina and Florida are scoreless.
25th ranked Kansas trails Mississippi 7-3. We 'll be back with more scores.
back to the one-yard line and it will go against Utah again.
with time-out on the field, let's go to our studios in New York for an update on today's college football.
how we doing?
down here.
while Michigan just put the hammer to Illinois. 44-12.
Florida,no problem beating North Carolina 42 to 7, while Northern Washington upset Iowa State 28-21.
pennsylvania manhandled Kentucky 31 to 3.
bullshit!
and this just in. Arizona is hot.
all right! All right!
this guy is a machine. I mean, he...
all he does is work out and pick winners.
t alk about fit. You should see him with his shirt off.
really. I did. A serious side of beef.
enjoy your daughter's birthday. Come on.
what do you mean? You should check him out.
I know you want to. - Walter.
get out of your head. It's a bad neighborhood.
Touchdown!
I'm gonna have the Bruchetta here, and this right here.
very good. And may I say, sir, an excellent choice.
I think it's pronounced "bruschetta."' "Bruschetta."'
they're little pizzas, but they don't have cheese in them.
bruschetta? - Perfect.
who cares? Anyone who goes 20 for 24 college football, 1 2 for 1 4 professional, 1 75 calls on the 900 number, you can call bruschetta anything you want, son.
ever have a thousand-dollar bottle of wine?
no. - Steward!
Walter, it's a waste. He hardly drinks. - It's a celebration. Steward.
Walter, it's... - Toni, come on.
just 'cause he's with reformed drunks doesn't mean he can't enjoy himself.
I was a lot of things, Walter, I was never a drunk.
actually, truth be told,
I've never had a 12-dollar bottle of water either.
he thinks we're fighting. - Yeah.
no, I don't. Look, hey, this is great, all of this. Thank you, Walter, Toni.
watch out, Walter. He's a fixer.
I should've ordered two. - What did the doctor say? Come on.
well, if you really want to know - I've been meaning to tell you - I went yesterday, and he seemed very concerned.
afterwards, he sat me down and looked into my eyes, and he said:
who do you like in the Buffalo-Oakland game?
you tell him Buffalo? - Shit, Walter. It wasn't funny.
you didn't know I was joking? It's a joke. Jokes are funny.
wow, what a meal. You haven't touched your sauce.
it's chocolate. I hear it's good for you.
I'm not raising a kid alone, Walter. - Come on, don't be dramatic, Toni.
in biblical times, you'd just move in with my brother Morty, anyway.
Oh, look at that.
beauty and the beasts. What do you think?
I like her, man. I think she's extremely cute.
Brandon, she's looking at you.
Yeah, but so are those two guys she's with.
I tell you what. I'll bet you ten to one on a thousand you can't pick her up.
that's 10, 000 cash if you leave this restaurant with that girl.
I have a better idea. Why don't we go to Atlantic City and open a house account?
you know you can't gamble. Come on.
who's gambling? I haven't flipped a coin since the '80s. This is just a challenge.
a challenge?
10, 000... to one.
cash? - Mm-hm.
what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna introduce myself. - Before you make your move, sit.
where are you going? - No problem. Don't worry.
you sit here and rest your little self.
excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt or anything, but I just gotta know this.
we're sitting over there with my friends and I'm thinking you are drop-dead gorgeous, and we just want to know...
your dates look like they haven't missed a meal since Christ died.
seriously, you're eating like you got a date with the electric chair.
what is going on? No, no, no.
it's all over. Sit, sit, sit.
just joking. Sorry.
I don't want to get wounded with a fork. - Jerk. Moron.
I'm gone. Thank you very much. - What the hell was that?
I went too far. - Oh, yeah.
I'll buy them a bottle of champagne. - You'll pick up their check.
the voice of reason.
thank you. Uh-oh.
your date's going to the bathroom.
I don't think that helped me out too much, do you?
well...
but, hey, thanks for the introduction.
Hey, I was just raising the bar a little.
John Anthony could close her.
you are beautiful.
excuse me. - Hang on a second.
I want to get to know you.
you just want to get in my pants.
no. No, no, no, no, no. I want to get in your mind and your heart and your soul, and I don't see you wearing any pants in that equation.
do you?
let me ask you something.
OK, forget the 900 numbers. Now you're ready.
we're moving up. We're going to the second floor.
this is where we print the money. Put your ear to the door.
Wow.
that's the sound of possibilities.
this is it. This is where the sales people turn a ten-dollar bettor into a 1, 000-dollar bettor before he knows he made the call.
I'm asking do they use Astroturf or AstroPlay?
Tammy. Give it up, baby.
you know what I need. - Sure do.
Tammy, this is Brandon. - How are you, Tammy?
OK, this is our phone sheet. The losers who need us.
the more they bet, the more we win.
we take 10% of a winning bet anywhere from 500 to 500, 000.
that's Southie. - Let's make some serious money.
what's the game plan? - You know what?
you're a private security guard. Bang a cheerleader, extract the information.
well, it was a substantial sum. Walter, he's a little miffed at our picks.
just do what you got to do.
it says right here that the minimum bet is five grand.
Reggie Hawks. Best salesman ever. Ever.
I don't have time for this kind of shit, Jimmy. I know you're a loser.
if you were a big winner, you wouldn't pay to call me.
you got your head outta your ass yet?
is this my office?
well, do you like it? - What's not to like, Walter? Thank you.
Miami New York point spread just went up to ten.
what do you think? - Miami is a lock. Are you kidding me?
this is Jerry, my top handicapper. Came to me straight out of grad school.
whoa. Phone boy makes good, huh? It's a big jump from 900 numbers.
make sure you don't get a nosebleed up here. I'm just kidding.
nice meeting you. Gotta get to work. - Nice meeting you too.
say, by the way, tonight's game New York wins that outright.
Really?
they always play the Fish tough and tonight it's foregone.
I wish I had a pen because I would never write that down. You know college is right for you.
you have to work your way up to pro ball around here. Good luck.
rookie's got balls. I almost like it, but I don't. Good luck.
I get that all day.
you know, I got three guys who can pick games, I got 20 who can sell.
I never had one who could do both.
what? You mean me? - No, not you.
I'm talking about John Anthony.
John Anthony doesn't exist.
Oh? Well, I'm shocked, because I'm standing in his office and you're sitting in his chair.
so you want me to sell.
like those guys out there? - Yes.
big bettors don't want middlemen. They want the guy giving them the picks.
you got a problem with selling? - No. I don't have a...
there's a few choice phrases we use here.
you just start with those. Now, here's an easy one.
I don't want your money. I want your bookie's fucking money.
give it back to me.
I don't want your money.
I want your bookie's money.
I don't want your money. I want your bookie's money.
that's not bad.
what happened to "fuck"? - What about it?
I said it. You don't use it? - Nah.
Really? A religious thing? - No, it's not a religious thing. I just...
it was all right for Chaucer 600 years ago.
Hey! I don't want to embarrass you, but I gotta do this.
I got someone here who has a problem saying "fuck."'
hold on. - Fuck you!
look at that. A lot of brunettes.
where are we headed?
we're gonna continue your education.
Hi. Is this the meeting? - Yes, yes. Come on in. Hi.
you'd think with two mortgages out, the repo guys staking out my car, my job on the line, and my wife threatening to leave, that I'd stop, instead of staying in the chase, doubling down.
it's a disease, Leon.
Yeah, man. Look, admitting you have a problem is the first step.
Yeah.
I guess I must be doing pretty good because I've got one big problem.
don't worry about it, Leon. - It's OK, Leon.
hang in there, Leon. - Hey.
my name is Walter and I'm new to this group...
Hey, Walter.
but I am not new to these meetings. I've been coming 18 years now.
as a matter of fact, friends, this is my 936th consecutive meeting.
Hey, man, well done.
well done is right.
and in all that time I haven't once been to a track or a casino or bet on a game.
hand to God, not a cent.
so I know where you're coming from, Leon.
believe me, I know. I heard your story, and it's something I relate to, but I gotta say, if I learned anything, it's that gambling is not your problem.
it's not? - Not even close.
I don't know how to say this without sounding rude, but you're a lemon, Leon.
like a bad car, there is something inherently defective in you.
and you. And you. And me. And all of us in this room.
we're all lemons. We look like everybody else, but what makes us different is our defect.
you see, most gamblers, when they go to gamble, they go to win.
when we go to gamble, we go to lose, subconsciously.
me, I never feel better, or more alive, than when they're raking the chips away, not bringing them in, and everybody knows what I'm talking about.
hell, even when we win, it's just a matter of time before we give it all back.
but when we lose, now, there's another story, when we lose.
I'm talking about the kind of loss that makes your asshole pucker up to the size of a decimal point.
you know what I mean? You've just recreated the worst possible nightmare this side of malignant cancer for the 20th goddamn time, and you're standing there and you suddenly realize:
Hey, I'm still here.
I'm still breathing.
I'm still alive.
us lemons, we fuck shit up all the time on purpose, because we constantly need to remind ourselves we're alive.
leon, gambling's not your problem.
it's this fucked-up need to feel something, to convince yourself you exist.
that's the problem.
Hey, you're the guy I see on TV every weekend selling betting picks.
so what? - Oh, yeah, he's right. This guy peddles a tout service on TV.
you read the charter, buddy? We all left our jobs at the door.
are you gonna throw an ex-alcoholic bartender out of an AA meeting?
what? - You're gonna do that? That's bogus.
Hey, didn't you come in with this jerk? - Come on.
I don't like the feeling I'm getting.
if you rethink things, here's my card.
we're topping 80% this season. Put it in your wallet.
you never know when you'll relapse. - Get out!
what the fuck was that?
what did you just say? - That was bullshit.
you gave your business card.- No, no. You said fuck.
so what? - Brandon. So what? That's great, man.
it was all worth it just from that one word.
from the one word fuck, I could feel your frustration, I could feel your anger.
man, I'm proud of you.
his name is Amir.
he's a dime bettor.
owns a dry cleaners.
we got him for the subscription.
Amir,He's on line one. Mm, ding, ding.
Mm.
good morning.
Walter wanted your first call to be special.
OK. Go get 'em, tiger. - You got it.
Me-me-me-me-ow-ow-ow!
Mm-hm.
Amir, my man. John Anthony here. - Yes. Hello.
Yes, hello to you, sir. How's your morning?
mine started off outstanding. Not as outstanding as I plan my weekend being.
Billy, listen. Thanks for the $1 5, 000 FedEx.
it's called a three-team parlay. It pays six to one.
how much can you lay? 20 grand?
are you crazy?
no way. Listen, I was betting a thousand a game.
I've got a game that I'm calling my lock of the decade, OK? Texas v OU.
now, Texas is receiving six points in this game.
they're gonna win it by two touchdowns. - Really?
I like Oklahoma in that game. - You do?
I shouldn't have called. Thank you for your time.
hold on. I've got Vegas on the line.
when we get our 30 grand from last night, then I tell you who he likes next week.
the only thing you gotta know about any of our clients is that they're all in a hole.
the second they pick up the phone, you got them.
I'll tell you once. Green Bay, Dallas, Cleveland. 1 00, 000 across the board.
get to the point, you're above them.
let 'em know it. Let 'em feel it. More John Anthony.
what's your favorite drink, my man? - Favorite drink?
I don't know.
pina colada. - Whoa.
tomorrow, we gotta get you a new drink, but today, here's what you're gonna do.
you're gonna go down to your bookie and lay 20 large on Texas.
then you'll go home, put on your favorite Hawaiian shirt, and you'll sit back, twirl your little umbrella after you've made that rum concoction with the orange slice and the cherry, and you'll watch Texas rip those Okies a new asshole.
and after you win the 20 grand, you're gonna call me back and you're gonna tell me, "Thank you, sir. May I have another?
mcneil lost his dog last week to a hunting accident.
you don't mess with a man who just lost his dog.
WESTERN Union me ten thou and let's ride this wave into Sunday.
Denny, boy! I've got something good for this weekend.
green Bay against Minnesota. I want you to lay $500 on the Cheeseheads.
let Stu in on that too, and take care of Mama. T alk to you later.
t ammy, who's on four?
forget the other games you wanted to bet.
let's throw that 4, 000 on this 1, 000 and make it five, take it money line and turn it into 1 2, 000.
John Anthony here.
Hello, everybody, and welcome to "Football Tonight."
Ten-yard line, he passes and that's a blind throw.
he's in the end zone!
Touchdown! - Yes!
good ball game. 10-7. Oakland upsets New York.
OK. No, that sounds good. Actually, you know what? Monday...
go, Daddy, go! Can't you go any faster?
Hey! Ten and two, pro football?
85% weekend. You're a mutant!
I definitely want to be there with him. Put it on a plate.
Oh, my God. Thank you. You saved my life. That is beautiful.
what... What's going on?
Walter's doctor - this is good news - finally put him on an exercise program.
I want to be there the first time to make sure the trainer understands his aversion to consistency. Excuse me.
aversion to consistency? - Mm-hm.
that's Walter. He's always been that way.
well, that's consistent. - Well, that's true.
you are cute. T ake a bite. Tell me what you think.
life is fucking good.
So,Iet's talk about making it better.
Uh-oh. Duck, Brandon. Here it comes.
I'm thinking of putting John Anthony on TV this week.
if you do this, from here on out, you're gonna have to eat, sleep, drink, breathe, talk, walk and fart John Anthony.
that's the way it is. There's no holding back.
you gotta be it, completely, or it doesn't work.
that's right, and just think it over. Don't decide now.
it's the only move. If it means I've gotta act, that's cool.
no. No acting. This is living.
you didn't hear me.
from here on out,
Brandon Lang and his fettuccine knee, and his self-fucking-pity, is as flat dead as Donald Trump's hair.
and John "l Can Walk On Fucking Water" Anthony has taken his place.
now, listen to what he's asking you, Brandon.
I'm gonna build an empire around you.
it's gonna cost me.
you understand what I'm saying? - Hell, yeah, I understand.
I'm John fucking Anthony. I've got a crystal ball.
I am sitting on top of the world, just rolling along
OK, John Anthony breathes.
now we gotta get a walk and talk.
I'm just asking.
I'm looking for a car for my friend here.
let's see. What's his name? - John Anthony.
Mr. Anthony. - Yes, sir.
do you have any credit? - No.
of course not. I don't know, Wally, can you trust him?
with my wife.
naked. - Well, in that case, the floor is yours.
glory, hallelujah, I just phoned the parson , Hey, Pa, get ready to call , Just like Humpty Dumpty I'm about to fall - Hey, what's "900 King"? - That's me. John Anthony.
I don't lose. - Thank you.
I want you to meet Mr. Miracle, John Anthony. There he is.
it's never ever gonna go down.
give me all you got.
singing a song
I'm ready. I'm ready.
a star is born today. How you doing?
scared shitless. - You're sweating.
you'll be all right. Don't worry. You've got the script. Read off the TelePrompTer.
you've been here before, kid.
remember football? - No, this is different.
how's this different? - No opponent.
then you're a lock to win. - Walter, we're ready.
you'll be OK. Remember, stay with the script.
45 seconds.
that's a lifetime. - For you, boss. This is for you.
Tony, you good? OK, everybody, we're gonna go.
we back? - Places.
John Anthony, huh? - Yep.
all's I see is another wannabe in a thousand-dollar suit.
word to the wise, keep the suit you came in with.
all right, Jethro? Good luck to you.
in five, four...
I'll do that. -...three, two...
welcome to this week's Sports Advisors,
america's premier sports-information program, with myself, Walter Abrams, and a truly gifted newcomer to the Sports Advisor panel.
I want you to meet him, a substantial find, and his name is John Anthony.
OK, we're entering week six in professional football.
this is when the cream rises to the top. This is when things get hot.
this is oven-mitt time. Am I right? This is big-time ball season.
so let's get right into it with the wizard of odds, Jerry "The Source" Sykes. Jerry.
stats, records, rankings, weather, if the goalpost is tilted just a little bit...
the SYKES system uses 42 proven indexes to eliminate the guesswork in sports wagering.
without my patented computer-based picks, you got a better shot of having God show up at your door with nine strippers, a bag of pure Bolivian cocaine, enough Viagra to make Chuck's head blow off, than picking these things on your own.
you call me absolutely free. I got five picks this weekend that are incredible.
1-800-238-6648. Give me a call.
how many gamblers did I bail out last weekend with my game of the year?
a 1 00-dollar bettor made $1 0, 000.
a 500-dollar bettor made $50, 000.
well, I got six games on Sunday that I'm releasing absolutely free.
these games are a burial, a blowout, a human lock.
you can bet your children's unborn children's children on these six games absolutely free!
whoa, whoa, I believe, I believe!
I believe you're trying to make me deaf.
I've never seen a color on a man like that. Would you say that's chartreuse?
so Saturday comes before Sunday, and looking at Saturday's college match-ups is the last, but certainly not least, member of the sports advisors.
and here he is, Mr. John Anthony. - Thank you, Walter.
this is John Anthony, the million-dollar man with the billion-dollar plan.
wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood, all your big money is gonna stay and play with me.
that's right. That's why they call me the million-dollar man.
the million-dollar man, the million-dollar man, the million-dollar man.
I can't say that, man.
uh... - No, no.
somebody wrote some very clever stuff for me here,
Iike the million-dollar man.
so let's just call me John.
I played quarterback, division one.
every QB knows that the secret, the key, to victory is anticipation.
the ability to see the future and react to it.
now, that is what I do.
and that is the truth.
so I'm not gonna sell you today, all right? I'm just gonna tell you the facts.
for over one year,
I have been picking 80% winners.
unbelievable?
used to be.
I know the leagues. I know the teams.
I know these players. I know this wonderful game called football.
call the number on the bottom of your screen, and ask for John.
let's make some money.
I'm not here. Go back to sleep. - Walter, it's four in the morning, honey.
what a show.
come to bed.
man, you should have seen him.
I just sat there and watched him roll.
I swear he made me want to pick up a phone and call.
I took the sales boys down the Smith and Wo's to get them primed for the weekend, and Chuck got so drunk he took a swing at one of the deer heads on the wall.
I don't know what we're gonna do. I'll hire more guys on Monday.
I got to. I gotta get more phones.
everything's amping up. - Yeah?
this guy, I'm telling you,
I'm gonna do this whole dot-com thing around him, you know?
I swear, if I had me when I was his age...
you know, I never had a mentor.
now I got a protege. You know?
someone you hand it all down to.
if anything happens to me, he steps in.
he steps in.
just knowing that, with this thing, you know.
it's like having a son. - Walter, come here.
it's beautiful. It's beautiful, beautiful.
you gotta go back to sleep. - What are you doing?
I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go for a run. - No. Walter...
see the sunrise. - Come here. Just for a second.
come here. You're exhausted.
no, I'm not. I wanna go do the bridge thing, you know, up-up-up Fifth?
Walter, I haven't seen you all day. Just come to bed for one minute.
just for a minute, bcause, you know, I've got the trainer tomorrow.
the trainer wants me to run. - I know, baby.
he wants me to run in place, you know? - I know, honey.
run from one place to another place.
no time to sleep, just because you're so exhausted, I mean, that's no time to sleep.
you're right. No time for sleep.
I'll be right here when you get back from your run.
that's nice of you.
I'll be right here right beside you, Walter. - Oh, that's nice of you.
I'm not going anywhere.
it's OK.
just close your eyes for one second before you go, OK?
know about Stokey being out against New York?
a knock would be nice, Jerry. - I'm kinda underwater here, man.
a yes or no would be great. - No, I don't.
if you know something, or if you hear anything, you gotta let me know, 'cause that's the way we work.
I'll rush right over, stat.
I've been here six years. You've been here one.
what are you doing in here? Hit the phones, man. Do some damage control.
rewrite that friggin' computer program.
Hey, it was a fucked weekend. - For some people.
there's a 50-dime bettor who wants to talk to John Anthony.
what's his name? - Carl. He owns McDonald's franchises.
wait a minute. I landed that lead. He's my guy.
was. - He's raiding my list now?
your clients are jumping ship, you lactose-intolerant fuck. Get out.
come on. - Excuse me.
we're home! We're home! We're home! We're home!
can we play princess? - Oh, yes, can we play princess.
you go get in your princess outfit. Everything, OK?
I'll put the groceries away, then I'll come and play.
OK! - You go ahead.
you got it made. You gotta admit that.
I got a little cab fare.
that... that won't hurt. Hey, baby.
I can explain this. It's...
Gail, that's my wife, Toni. - Hi.
thank you. - It's OK, really.
Walter, I'll talk to you later, OK? Thanks. - Bye-bye.
what the hell's going on here, Walter?
you don't seriously think I had something to do with that girl, now?
I just brought her up here to pay her off. I got her for John. Come on.
don't bullshit me, Walter. - Oh, no.
you can't be serious. You think I slept with this girl?
who the hell's John? Who's John? - John. John Anthony. Ring a bell?
you got Brandon a hooker?
he's working late, he's in a new city, he has no friends. Yes, I got him a hooker.
are we gonna have this conversation?
are you completely, completely clueless, Walter?
why are you so angry? - Why am I so angry?
look at you. You're jealous. Look at you.
Oh, God. Jealous of what? Of what? - I don't know. Brandon getting laid.
you really are crazy. 'Cause that sick thought never entered my mind.
Oh, that's not where those thoughts enter.
OK, I'm done. I'm done. That's it.
you'll be happy to know, he didn't sleep with her. I just paid her for coming.
pardon the pun. - Oh, you're hysterical.
daddy! - Oh!
daddy! - Where's my baby?
look at her! Look at her! Look at her!
coming up, week-seven predictions with our new star John Anthony, who went an amazing 24 and six in last weekend's games.
Jerry. - Yeah.
John's up first tonight.
what? - John Anthony is leading off tonight.
John Anthony's leading off? - Is there an echo in here?
engineer! Sound! Help me, I'm hearing everything twice.
two years I lead off and you bury me in the deck over a couple lousy weekends?
this is bullshit, Walter. - three, two...
welcome to week seven.
I'm in the garage. - Hook it up?
Yeah. You wanna hear it? - Man, let me hear it.
OK.
it is the bomb. - Oh, that's what I'm talking about.
that's what I'm talking about, my man.
I'm about to head out. Everything else cool?
Yeah, sort of. Did Dad reach you?
dad? No. Why? - Must be out of money. He keeps calling.
he saw you on TV and wants to talk.
I gave him your work number, but he says they won't put him through.
I don't know what that's about. I'll check into it.
let's walk. You could use the exercise.
stop worrying. We're set for life. We got Jimmy the Greek here.
he makes Nostra-fucking-damus look like a novelty act. Brandon, to the right.
you love that, don't you?
let me ask you a question, Walter. - Shoot.
have you been blocking any of my calls?
of course. You don't need distractions right now, my boy.
lot of crazies out there. - Does that include my father?
you're asking me, I'm gonna tell you. Yeah.
you son of a bitch.
how long?
about two weeks. - Walter.
come on. Brandon, would you have taken the call if I put it through?
that's not the point. That's not the point.
what is the point? I'd like to know. What's the story with you and your father?
you tell me. You seem to know. - Well, I know pieces.
that's about all.
Hey, man, I was just trying to spare you. - Who are you gonna spare me from, huh?
he was a drunk, left when I was nine. I couldn't compete with the bottle.
end of fucking story. So you won't spare me nothing.
if I want to talk to him, I will. Spare me. You fuck.
is that it? Is that all you got?
I will match my dysfunctional childhood and Toni's against yours any day.
my father - five foot, arms like this. He had a cock like a Hebrew National.
if I even looked at him the wrong way he'd smack me like Jake LaMotta.
by the time I was five, he yelled at me so much I thought my name was asshole.
broke my nose three times.
Toni, tell him about you. Come on.
I didn't have a great childhood either. - Great?
tell him about the uncle.
well, I think he gets the idea now.
come on. Suffice it to say, she was abused by everybody but the family pet.
OK, Walter, please.
your father was a drunk. He was a jerk. So what?
it happens. I'm glad I blocked those calls. You know why?
you need a new image of a man. How about me?
she's laughing. - 'Cause that's a scary fucking thought.
Hey, Brandon, listen to me, man.
the shit that happened to you, to me, to Toni, you know what that is?
it's just that, shit that happened, because after the therapy and the psychiatry and the meetings, you know what it all comes down to?
we're all fucked up.
we are all just so fucked up.
now, you gotta just say that shit out.
l am fucked up and I ain't gonna take it anymore.
come on. You too, Toni. Let's do it. All of us. Wallow with me here a minute.
we are so fucked up, we're not gonna take it anymore.
I am so fucked up with all of you that I'm not gonna take it anymore.
how's that?
Hey! I'm trying to sleep here, asshole.
that you, Dad? - OK, Walter.
I'm gonna kick your fucking head in.
let's go. - Don't wait up.
Amir, you've got to be kidding me, huh?
are you gonna haggle over 50 grand after the 250, 000 I just made you last weekend?
look, don't get me wrong, John. 50, 000 seems slightly steep.
steep. Amir, let's rewind a second.
first time you call,No cuff. you're in a hole the size of the Grand Canyon, crying about having to hock your fiancee's ring.
now, today, you're calling me from a red, convertible F1 Ferrari, isn't that it?
right? Candy red? Yeah, you doing the math?
I am. All right? I'm gonna cut you off.
Oh, come on, John. - I'm coming on.
if we keep working together, I'll charge a 10% aggravation tax.
get your ass to Western Union tonight.
wire me 75 grand and maybe we can kiss and make up.
OK, OK, John. Now, let's...
John Anthony. Talk to me.
may I please speak to Brandon Lang? - Mom?
Hey, honey, is that you? - Yeah, it's me!
are you OK? - Mom, I have never been better.
I need an hour with Sheik Rashid.
so, you want to use Sheik Rashid to do an end run around Ihab?
does your brother even know you're here?
you understand our precautions?
yesterday you were my enemy.
but today you are my guest.
he is meeting Ihab Rashid on my orders.
Bassam's been nowhere near Ihab in the last 24 hours.
that is wrong.
we could try again, that's all.
we try and I fail-- I will feel worse.
change the subject.
I trusted you.
you are my blood and you betrayed me.
uh... you need to see something.
I demand to sit down with President Jamal Al Fayeed!
he demands?
jamal, you can end this... without firing a shot.
this is what you wanted.
is it?
general, tell your men to stand down.
but, Mr. President?
you lied to me.
failed to inform you of my every move. - Yes. - No, you didn't fail to inform, you lied, and right now you are lying again to me.
for God's sake, I'm your brother.
your blood.
jamal, can't we just talk about the result?
it's the result that ultimately matters.
why do you want to talk about the result?
the result sickens me.
you were supposed to offer one tribal monkey the opportunity to talk to me, and instead tribal monkey's father demands to talk to me
I'm not a fool.
but you are making me look like a fool.
you won't look like a fool.
Yes, it-it would have been nice if things had happened the way we wanted, but the net-net is the same.
the president of Abbudin is sitting down with the legendary patriarch of the opposition.
do you have any how huge that is? How great that is?
Yeah, for him.
meanwhile, in the country of Abbudin...
citizens continue to overrun Founder's Plaza with calls for everything from students' rights to the complete overthrow of the ruling Al Fayeed family.
the elderly Sheik Rashid continues to attract enormous crowds.
today's estimates placed the number at upwards of 15, 000.
up significantly from yesterday's 12, 000.
this makes no sense.
we have a wonderfully elegant way out of this.
Yes.
we simply bend over and try not to think about what is happening.
you just offered the Sheik the same package you offered Ihab three days ago.
jamal, these are your deal points.
why doesn't it rain?
anything, something to drive the people out of the Plaza.
Hey, you know what? I'm gonna call Tariq.
they have a mole in the Rashid camp; maybe they can tell us what it is he's looking for.
Yes, it's a good idea.
tariq only wants to be of help.
he's a big fan of the sheik.
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
well, what about Ziad?
maybe if he got some presidential love, he'd be willing to play ball.
my point is, I'm gonna try and have all of the deal points locked down before you even walk into the room, okay?
so, just, just sit with him; that's all you have to do.
in return, he'll tell everyone in the Plaza to go home, that they're part of the process now.
and do you know who's gonna get the credit?
you will, President Jamal Al Fayeed, for being willing to sit down with him and for being willing to listen.
bargaining with sheep herders.
look... I know it's hard, but sometimes you have to give something to get something and I think what we get is huge.
please, just ... just sit with the man.
it'll be you, me and Yussef.
we'll do it in the council chambers and I've told them they can bring two delegates if they want to.
and... what if I don't like what he has to say?
it's not an issue. If he asks for anything you're not prepared to give, you just say, "let me take that under advisement.
nice one.
let me...
let me take that under advisement.
let me... Let me...
let me take that under advisement.
if someone would have told me that the first visitor I'd be receiving in my capacity as first lady would be the sworn enemy of your father, I would have roared with laughter.
the Sheik is going to clear the Plaza.
he is going to clear the Plaza?
it's not his Plaza, it's not his country.
why are you so frightened of him?
frightened?
do I look like a frightened person?
you are naive.
you have some idea in your mind, that all a person has to do is mow down his enemies, that that is all there is to being a leader.
call your cousin in Egypt.
it's not so simple anymore.
everybody has a camera, everybody's on YouTube.
you just be sure... you just be sure...
that you smile when he walks through the door.
you're welcome.
I'm proud of you, by the way.
proud of a grown doctor who can't tie his own tie?
proud of you for getting people who thought they'd never be in the same country together, much less the same room... to talk about how they can move forward.
well, tell me that at the the end of the day when it's actually happened.
I keep feeling we're about an inch from this whole thing falling apart.
are you certain you can do this?
everything that's happening here is ultimately for you.
for your brothers. For your children.
I'm an old man, I am not long for this world.
I only ask you show the president the same respect he's showing us by inviting us here.
he didn't invite us.
you demanded an audience, shamed him into it.
I took the same invitation he offered you and turned it into a demand.
the point is, we are now facing our enemy across a table instead of a battlefield.
and the world thinks it was our doing.
now we must present ourselves accordingly.
as statesmen, as civilized human beings.
no bombast, no fire, just an eagerness to get things done.
can you help me?
sheik.
come.
walid -Yes, my brother.
I know you wanted to accompany me here today and now you have.
the pictures have been taken.
now get back in the car and go home.
E-excuse me?
I came here to assist you... in these negotiations.
I've been working with the Al Fayeeds for over a decade now.
I know how they think.
you've made yourself a friend to the very people who drove me from my home.
get back to the car and leave.
my wife Molly.
how are you?
welcome.
sheik.
all set?
I just heard Ihab is here.
Yeah, he's part of the delegation.
apparently, it all happened at the last minute.
here's hoping nothing else happens at the last minute.
tell me, Ziad is sure about these bargaining points?
well, I asked him about 100 times.
that Ihab so much as looks at me cross-eyed and I'll throw him back in the prison.
what about the Sheik?
he can't help but look at you cross-eyed.
Mr. President.
welcome, sir.
Mr. President.
sheik Rashid.
please.
excuse me, have you a toilet?
his mouth's full of phlegm.
Yeah, of course.
well, gentlemen, this is a meeting decades in the making.
where should we start?
taxation? Representation on the council?
perhaps it's even time to rethink the nationalization of some of Ma'an's natural resources.
you are very generous, President.
and very astute.
I know you very much want the Founder's Plaza returned to normal.
people back in their homes.
businesses able to receive customers.
I believe I can make all that happen.
there is really just one thing I want in return.
tell me what is on your mind.
I would like to ask, now that your father has passed, that you allow there to be open and free elections for the office of president of Abbudin, monitored by the U. N. open to any candidate, no matter their political or religious affiliation.
let me take that... under advisement.
very well.
sheik Rashid, can we now rely upon you to clear the the Founder's Plaza?
let me take that... under advisement.
nothing to fear... just gravity.
he wants elections!
is he out of his mind?
I'm not begging the people for my right to lead them.
these talks were a horrible idea.
the talks were not a horrible idea.
Yes, he outmaneuvered us... - Yes, I would say so.
so, what do we do, Mr. Advisor?
what do we do, brother?
it turns out he wants to be George Washington.
typically with a crowd of this size,
I believe the estimate for today is almost 20, 000.
the people will see your heavy armor approaching, your tanks, and almost immediately you will lose 2, 000 or 3, 000.
but in this particular instance, since we've been visible to the crowd for several days without an order to proceed, we may not see quite so many flee initially.
but once we initiate use of the water cannons, the crowd will diminish by half.
it's that remaining 10, 000-- the semi hard-core
that becomes a challenge to disperse.
we'll begin with the rubber bullets, then conventional ammo.
all the while, the tanks...
are moving, converging on a center point.
and, obviously, anyone in their path...
the whole thing will take about 45 minutes.
although that's not counting the cleanup.
you're going to need at least a day of scrubbing before that plaza is once again presentable to the civilian population.
what kind of injuries can we expect?
my guesstimate?
2, 000 injured.
perhaps 200 fatalities.
of course, every day you wait, every minute you wait, those numbers rise.
any of the great minds here have any options to offer?
or is this it?
we kill 200 today, then go to war with our people tomorrow.
not to make light of it, but, uh...
we're quite good at going to war.
I have every confidence we will prevail.
I need an hour to reflect.
free and open elections-- exactly what the Sheik said.
no, think about it, it gives you everything you want, everything you could possibly hope for.
what does it give me?
options. And all of them are good.
the first thing it gives you is the Plaza will be empty.
what can the people possibly protest about when the choice of who leads them is theirs?
but then... I have to run to regain leadership.
okay. And what's the worst that can happen?
Bassam... I lose.
everything our father built, everything we achieved...
everything we are ceases to be.
I get that. I do.
but look, the days when a single family can continue to rule by sheer force of will are pretty much over, with or without elections.
so if you lose... you lose.
and you wake up the next day and you start living the rest of your life, except no one's hanging you, no one's shoving a bayonet up your ass, the crowd isn't calling for your head-- you just go away.
you move your money to Switzerland, or wherever guys like you move your money, you buy your own goddamn island, and you're still one of the richest men in the world.
but here's the thing.
I don't think you're gonna lose.
I won't? - No.
these elections are a year, a year and a half away.
first you got to change the constitution-- that's gonna take some time
and then comes the campaign-- that's a year, a year and a half-- and in that time, the people are getting to know you, and when they get to know you, they're gonna love you.
and while they're busy falling in love with you, you're gonna do what powerful people do-- you build 20 schools, they're gonna love you. ten hospitals, a bunch of parks.
and what's the Sheik gonna build?
well... he's not going to build shit.
no, he's just gonna cough and spit and... look at people with that milky eye.
so... we are going to win this?
I think we can.
three weeks later.
wake up. Look who's back.
I'm pleased for you both.
here's hoping the two of you will be very happy together.
what's wrong with you?
what's wrong with you?
bargaining away our lives.
not to mention your child's birthright.
I can't believe you are still mad about this.
three weeks and you are still mad about it.
don't you watch television?
they are calling me "A beacon of hope in the Middle East."
good for them.
maybe you can call them and have them play with your new friend.
I'm not interested.
good morning, Yussef. What can I do for you?
what? 60 Minutes?
what is... You mean the television show?
they want to do a piece about me?
spending a day with the Sheik is like trailing a rock star.
wherever he goes, he is besieged with requests for pictures and autographs.
Jamal? - And he never hesitates to stop the...
the, uh, council's waiting.
it's a wonderful thing to want to build schools and hospitals and parks.
I don't think that's the Office of Budget Management's issue.
then... what is their issue?
I'm the president. I... I want this money. I need this money.
the way we would normally fund these sorts of projects would be to sell bonds on the world market.
and I don't think under normal circumstances that would be a problem.
explain.
it's just... ever since you announce elections...
what about the elections...
there's concern that the debt holder might change, and might not be interested in honoring the obligations these bonds represent.
no, no, no, no, no.
the debt holder is not going to change-- that's the whole point.
now, we want the people to vote for me...
so we need money to build things.
Why?
you are the president.
the constitution does not call for these elections.
there's no need for these for these elections.
we gain nothing from these elections, and in fact may have created for ourselves the mechanism of our own demise.
call them off. - And what about the people?
we've already told them. - I'll deal with the people.
I always have.
Mr. President, please.
embrace who you are and what is yours.
let's put an end to this foolishness.
60 Minutes called.
what does that mean?
didn't Yussef tell you?
60 Minutes called.
they want to do a piece about me.
have they ever wanted to do a piece about you?
how about you?
well... I've been called...
to an emergency meeting with a delegation from Norway.
when I return, I want to hear that these new construction projects have been financed.
I also want to hear how excited the military is about the prospects for free elections in Abbudin.
thank you, gentlemen.
this meeting is adjourned.
the Norwegian president has asked me to meet him alone.
something about a pipeline situation.
no one even knows he's here, so I'll text you as soon as I am safely in the room.
no hello?
no "It's been a long time"?
no "I've missed you."
hello.
it's been a long time.
and as you can see, I've missed you.
you need to come see me more often.
that was like an explosion.
a presidential explosion?
a presidential eruption.
can I ask you something?
do you think the people love me?
well, the people don't know you.
but if they did, I am sure that they would love you.
how could anyone not love you?
may I?
I know we, uh, we don't see eye to eye on a few things.
the elections, the Sheik.
if you've come here to tell me what to say or to drill me the way you've been drilling my husband and the others...
let me remind you, I've been in the public eye since I was 18.
I know what to say when the cameras are on.
and I know what to do when the cameras are off.
of course you do.
what?
you.
you're so...
...impressed with yourself.
look at me. Look at what I did.
I'm bringing democracy to Abbudin.
you really believe he can do this?
win the votes and the love of the people?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I guess it helps to be away from him for 20 years.
forgive the intrusion.
you cannot outrun history.
one would be a fool to stick one's head in the sand and not see how change is sweeping the Middle East.
change... and cell phones.
everyone has a voice, everyone has an opinion, and everyone has a camera.
it simply stands to reason then, that everyone would expect to have a say about how they are governed.
well, he's my son, so of course I think he's special.
and he's always seen things differently than his father, so I'm not entirely surprised that he's turning everything on its head.
trying things that have never been tried before.
but the main thing is that I think he wants what's best for the country.
even if it's not him.
and I think that gives you a hint at just how special he is.
I don't say these things for effect.
I say them because...
this is the reality.
this is how I truly feel about it.
we are coming to this place one way or the other.
we can either be in front of it or behind it.
just look at me. Here we go.
you served for three decades as the head of the military for an ironfisted dictator.
now here comes the son, and he's freeing political prisoners, sitting down with opposition leaders, calling for elections.
isn't your head spinning?
yes and no.
my nephew is a visionary.
but he is also very much like his father, my brother.
my brother looked at the vast desert, the warring tribes, the hostile outside forces conspiring against him and nonetheless felt that he could build a nation.
insane.
and yet here we are. A nation.
with abundant schools and hospitals and a vibrant economy.
and now my nephew says, what if we have elections?
what if we let the people choose?
you think they might choose me?
an old dog like me thinks... insane.
but then I remember his father.
and I think crazier things have happened.
are we through?
set.
a wife always wants to believe she's her husband's greatest love.
but long ago I made peace with the fact that
I'm in second place.
I'm sorry-- second place to who?
your opponent, Sheik Rashid, a sworn enemy of your family for over two decades, calls you either the bravest or the most foolish man on the continent.
that's really funny.
I didn't know Sheik Rashid has that sense of humor.
but, uh... I like Sheik Rashid.
uh, I would not vote for him, for sure.
but I like him. The people like him, too.
he is leading in the polling.
it's early to say.
the elections are a long way off.
and I think, in time, people will realize that what they feel for the Sheik is actually what you feel for an uncle that you haven't seen for a long time.
nostalgia.
but if you look around, you can see what we have built together, as a nation.
and I'm sure you will say, I love that.
I want more of that.
I want more of the people-- of the family-- that did that.
you sound very confident.
would you be interested in hearing what the Sheik had to say about you?
what do you make of this new, young president ，Al Fayeed?
obviously, he marches to the beat of his own drummer.
and when you sit with him in a room, you know you are sitting with a lion.
of course, not all lions are friendly, and every so often, one will bite your head off.
but you have to admire his courage.
he didn't have to allow these elections.
he could have simply said no.
Yes.
he knows wise counsel when he hears it.
wise counsel?
he has a younger brother. Bassam.
an American.
like I said, Jamal may be a lion.
but I suspect his brother is the lion tamer.
the brother who tells the lion what to do.
we are getting reports that for the first time in 30 years, a significant number of young men of draft age are simply not showing up for induction.
this is despite the fact they know the penalty is death or life imprisonment.
additionally, among men already serving, we are seeing a measurable uptick in deserters.
again, these men are staring at certain death, and yet...
they don't care.
and finally, assaults against officers by conscripted men are up 11% compared to this same time last year.
and why do you think this is?
shifting sands, Mr. President.
the country is sensing change.
and change is not good for the status quo.
people don't obediently serve in a military they suspect of being disbanded.
and those already serving start looking for an exit strategy.
it's human nature.
are you saying this is because I have announced elections?
well, when you look at the latest polling...
latest polling?
Mr. President, there is a new polling.
and unfortunately it shows you just with 33% of the vote, while the Sheik has 44% of the vote.
that's not perfect.
but... still early.
and 44 to 33 is not really terrible.
no, Mr. President. It is not.
although it is somewhat troubling that just two weeks ago, you had 37 and he 41.
let me think about all of that, okay?
thank you very much for your patience, for your support and encouragements.
thank you.
forgive me for not getting up.
some days the legs cooperate happily. Some days they don't.
please.
thank you.
thank you for seeing me at such a short notice.
you made it sound urgent.
what was urgent was my brother not having to see me for a few days after hearing what you said on 60 Minutes.
you knew exactly what you were doing.
does it serve my interests for there to be friction between the man I'm running against and the man I've come to believe?
is it responsible for any success he's experiencing?
the answer is yes.
be flattered.
you remind me of your father.
Really?
and is that a good thing or a bad thing?
this may shock you, but I considered your father an extraordinary statesman right up until the the moment he betrayed me.
don't you mean right up until the moment you betrayed him?
you bombed an army barracks.
killed dozens of Abbudin soldiers without provocation.
did I? - It's what happened.
you bombed us, we gassed you.
our sin was greater but I doubt it would have happened if you hadn't attacked first.
I was looking for a peace with a man I believed wanted the same thing.
I never struck first.
I never struck at all, nor did any of my people.
then, who did?
maybe a man who wanted to gas 20, 000 people in Ma'an and needed a reason.
so, you're saying my father sacrificed his own men to give himself a reason to attack Ma'an?
I am offering a possible scenario, no more, no less.
but you didn't come here to debate history with me.
I'm here to extend you an invitation.
my brother would like you to be present for the signing of the motion to amend the constitution to allow free elections in Abbudin.
the motion to amend.
the tiny first step.
I mean what I say.
those days before the attack on Ma'an,
I really thought your father was one of the most extraordinary individual
I had ever met.
I disagreed with almost everything he stood for, but I admired his will to get things done, his willingness to listen to other opinions and ideas.
you are... your father's son.
I don't know why, but I can't seem to get the peoples' love.
I give them elections.
I free prisoners. Doesn't matter.
perhaps I'm just not lovable.
well, I find you very lovable.
Yeah, I know.
I think I'm lovable, too, but, the point is, when I...when I... when I... when I think about who actually loves me...
my father-- he liked me sometimes.
sometimes, yes. Sometimes, no.
my mother-- you know, she's my mother.
She-she loves her children no matter who they are.
and my brother.
my younger brother.
my little brother.
I see him look at me with pity.
I think he thinks that is love, but I know it's just pity.
that sounds very lonely.
what about your wife?
well...
I love you.
well, I know that.
I... I can tell.
with all your heart, right?
with all my heart, Mr. President.
Hey, don't jump. Screw the Sheik.
does your boyfriend know you talk about him like that?
so, long time, no see.
hmm, I've been busy.
you know, it's not easy hanging onto 33% of the vote.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
you know these polls are only accurate to within five points, right?
you know what that means?
it means I'm losing?
no, it means you could have 38 points, and he could have 39, which basically means you're in a dead heat.
well, tell that to my trusted council.
down the hall, there are people that have come from all over the world to see you do what you're about to do today.
when you put your pen to that document, the world will be different.
how many men get the chance to effect that kind of change in their lifetime?
you are making history today.
Really?
you sure it's not you?
Wow.
look at these two.
which one do you want?
are there two?
I see only one.
so, we'll, uh... we'll see you guys down in the ballroom.
they're setting up for some pictures with the Sheik, and then we'll move to the actual signing.
we were just out there.
people seem to be very excited about what you are going to do.
are you?
I think that you have it in you to be...
a great man and do great things.
but do I think this is one of them? I'm not sure.
that doesn't change how I feel about you.
and how do you feel about me?
jamal, if you don't know by now...
Oh, I plead for your love, and all I get is... anger.
that's not true.
then... give me your love... here, now.
don't be ridiculous.
I'll meet you down there.
Mr. President.
he's a force of nature, isn't he?
excuse me.
I will be right back.
right through that door, Sheik Rashid.
so...
this is where you are hiding.
great minds think alike. - Ah.
you are amazing to watch.
the people-- they really love you.
well, of course they do. I am a benign old man.
what's not to love?
I also love them right back.
and my brother Bassam.
do you love him?
I don't know about love, but he is a very clever fellow, your brother.
very wise, very principled.
I'll tell you another thing.
there's not a morning
I don't wake up and thank God.
I am not running against him.
you're okay?
that's it, cough it up.
cough it up, old man.
cough the whole lung!
you want me to get Bassam to help you?
you need a whack in the back.
did that help?
how about that?
you think everybody loves you?
well... forgive me. I don't.
Oh, how do you-- just like running into each other.
Hi, Jesse, hi, hey.
Oh hi! Just so funny we are always just like running into each other.
Hi, Betty rocker.
I guess we are just uh, two ships that pass in the morning.
how was the work last night?
uh, 34 bucks in tips and the cook spit on me.
why are you always up so early?
Oh, uh, work. Just so much to do, gotta get an early start.
want some coffee?
the guy at the shop, he gave me two.
it's decaf 'cause I know you have to sleep in the morning.
I mean he knows that you sleep in the morning.
it was just a coincidence.
Hey, oh, I knocked on your door last night.
you weren't there. I-I want to give you something.
Really? -Yeah, it's a couple new songs from my band.
I-I think it's pretty good, o-or it sucks, I don't know.
but listen, you have to be brutal 'cause you are always way too nice to me.
no , no , that's because I just, always like 'em.
you know, your music's so emotional.
and, that song "I Made Her Cry," made me cry.
you're sweet.
Oh hey, um, do you know if they fixed the TV in the laundry room yet?
cause there is Miles Davis Documentary tonight...
I have a TV.
I mean you don't have to watch in the laundry room.
you could just come over.
you know I'll be home, just doing stuff, so knock, or whatever.
all right, thanks. I will. -Okay.
so you're going to work? -Yes, yes.
Oh, that way.
Oh, my god!
Betty, I thought I heard something.
what are you doing here?
um, I'm starting work a little early.
me too. -You're naked.
and you're wearing a hideous ensemble, but I'm not all about the obvious.
Amanda. -Ok, stop grilling me!
I kind of got a little evicted.
what? How? Can you just put something on please.
I didn't pay my rent a couple times, and they got so nasty about it.
well, Amanda, you can't live here.
you must have like a hundred friends you could stay with.
you-- do you need some money?
Betty, please, stop caretaking.
God, it's like a disease with you.
and, I'm fine here.
one of the boys in security takes care of me.
and I take care of him. Hey Zander.
blind girl can't you see my love?
blind girl can't you see my love?
try to tell you, try to show you, try to...
you were, um, singing?
this is my friend Jesse's new song. It's really good.
Jesse! I've been hearing the name a lot.
whatever happened to no romantic entanglements?
wasn't that the rule?
Yes, it's still the rule.
now, can we please talk about the "Fashion Heats Up" party, because, we still don't have a band.
and M. I.A.'s people just called.
apparently she's on vacation in Brazil.
no one can get ahold of her.
woo, looks like Connor's here.
man, he is so cool.
hiring him is the smartest thing I've ever done.
Yeah, just wait till Wilhelmina finds out you tricked her, to get him here.
come on, Betty, I'm tired of her walking all over me.
I need as many people on Team Daniel as I can get.
besides, we need someone to run the financial arm of this company.
Connor's the best.
well, as a member of Team Daniel, I fully support you.
besides, everyone here loves him.
it's always been that way. At Harvard, he was a rock star.
captain of the Crew Team. All the girls loved him.
man, he got a lot of...
uh, Ahem, all the girls really loved him.
this is why I hate women, Marc.
they're weak.
Ugh, look at them throwing themselves at him.
although I'd love to live in his pants for a year.
Ugh, you're all fools.
the only thing that matters is that the new chief financial officer loathes Daniel Meade.
which means I'll have an ally.
so if it's you against Daniel...
he'll always agree with me.
I have to agree with Daniel. -Again?!
well, shooting in the Caribbean is just more cost efficient.
and as Daniel's already pointed out.
Ugh, yes, yes, yes.
Daniel has had so many great ideas today.
I guess, I'm just lucky.
Wilhelmina, I'm just giving you my honest opinion.
there simply aren't the funds for your proposal.
well, then find the funds.
okay, I'm going to be blunt.
this company owns too many magazines.
now if you want to funnel more money into "Mode,"
I suggest you have a look at selling off some of your titles.
finally... an idea I can agree with.
now I have a very strong relationship with "Conde Nast."
I think they may be interested in a sale.
no. We are not selling off a single magazine.
they're a part of my father's legacy.
that's ridiculous. Connor, come on.
it may be too drastic.
I'll explore other options.
excuse me.
why are you two so chummy?
what the hell is going on here?
I think what's going on, Wilhelmina, is you've been played.
why don't you try one of Connor's doughnuts?
they're really good.
okay, I've got chips and dip and carrot sticks.
you know, in case he's that guy.
now should I light candles or is that too romantic?
but maybe I like candles.
maybe I'm that girl.
if he could be that guy, I could be that girl, right?
Ooh! You are crushing hard.
Yes, maybe I like him.
but what are the chances that he's gonna like me back?
Oh, stop it. Henry and Gio were crazy about you.
that was different. Jesse's an artist.
he writes music, Hilda, and I get so dorky when I'm around him.
honey, please.
he's always asking you to listen to his music.
if a guy needs you to tell him how great he is, he likes you.
Really? -Yeah.
I don't know.
aunt Betty? -Yeah?
it's not that I don't love what you're wearing right now, it's very you-- but, um, maybe for tonight, we can go a little simpler.
okay. Thank you so much for coming.
it was so sweet of you guys to help...
but he's gonna be here any minute, so get out.
okay. -Okay. I love you.
okay, but I'm telling you, re-- mwah. -Bye.
okay, bye.
okay, bye.
coming!
building management kicked me out.
so I guess we're staying with you.
Ooh. What is this?
do you have a boy coming over?
wait. It is a boy, right?
cause I need to know these things if we're gonna be roomies.
um, Amanda, you can't stay here.
Why? You said I should stay with a friend.
Yeah, but I meant, like, Marc.
Oh, unh-unh. I don't want to jeopardize that friendship.
besides, Cliff practically lives there.
okay.
you know what?
I would love to help you, but right now is not a very good time.
but, Betty, I have nowhere else to go.
believe it or not, I don't have that many friends.
girls just don't seem to like me.
and you were so nice to me this morning.
I figured you wouldn't mind, because, you know, you're Betty.
you're a nice person.
Hey. So bad news. I have to cancel tonight.
this friend of mine-- or person of mine
is having some hard times.
I-- -No, that's totally cool, 'cause I probably wouldn't have been good company anyway.
you know, we just lost this gig to another band,
Buffalo Hump.
you know those guys? -No, can't say I do.
they suck. -Oh, I'm sorry, Jesse, but don't be discouraged.
your band is so great.
it's just a matter of time before it takes off.
well, you know what's so cool about you?
I... I really feel like you mean that.
Thanks, B. You have a good night.
okay. You, too.
Betty, we're out of the dip...
and I'm hungry.
dude, I have to say, it's good to have you here.
I think we're gonna make a great team.
me, too.
Oh, I put together a list of ideas to cut costs
small things, but I think they add up.
you don't have to run everything by me.
do what you think is best. And now you got my back.
we're bros.
Ugh. I hate that stupid fist bump.
talk to me.
I've been over and over Connor's contract.
you can't get rid of him without a huge buyout.
Oh, I put that in there to screw Daniel, not me.
so what are we gonna do?
get some dirt on Connor Owens, something I can use as leverage.
I will not be constantly overruled by two silly white boys.
I'm on it.
Oh, my god.
we totally match.
you and I are going to have so much fun.
is that my lunch?
Oh. Oh, sorry.
Halston, save some for Betty.
I can't sleep.
what do you want me to do about it?
sometimes it helps if you tickle my back and tell me I'm pretty.
you tickled her back? That's a little bit weird.
I had no choice. Christina, I needed to get some sleep.
I get it. I've done a lot worse things to get some sleep.
believe me. Betty, you're gonna have to kick her out.
but she's got no money.
well, I don't like the way she's interfering with your social life.
I want you to take this crush on to the next level.
I knew it.
Betty has a crush. It's someone from the building, right?
you're always darting in and out, all sweaty and mysterious.
Amanda, it is none of your business.
are you wearing my leggings? -It's cute, right?
and the other leg makes a matching scarf.
I have to say, I don't hate it. Well...
Ooh, ooh, I know who your lover is.
it's that troll from 3G who walks his guinea pig on a leash.
when are you two crazy kids gonna go out?
it's not the guy with the guinea pig, and I'm not going out with anybody.
because I don't even know if this guy likes me.
here's what you do. Invite him to the "Mode" party.
it'll be totally casz. -That's a good idea.
there'll be loads of people there, and it won't even feel like a date.
and if he turns out to be a serial killer, he can just find someone else to cut into pieces.
you're welcome.
so what do you think?
I think I'm gonna ask Jesse to the "Mode" party.
stop.
hey there, sexy.
Hey, big tiny.
uh, can we please work on a better nickname for me?
Why? It's cute.
so after work, let's meet at Prune.
because if I don't get a parsley and dandelion salad,
I swear to Barbra I am going to throw a fit with the fury of a thousand queens.
move in with me.
what? What did-- what did you say?
move... in... with... me.
I mean, we spend all our time together anyway.
I mean, doesn't it just make sense?
um, we should definitely talk about that.
because it definitely bears further discussion.
Marc!
coming, Willie. Oh, my god.
this day could not get any crazier.
busy. Busy. Busy. Busy. Busy.
there's just so much to do.
in fact, I don't even know if I'm gonna be able to do dinner tonight.
well, we'll--we'll, uh, we'll--we'll
we'll talk later or--or tomorrow.
and, um, okay.
Hi, Jesse.
Hey. -I was just thinking about you.
Really? Why?
well, um, I was thinking about you because -I was wondering, um... -Yeah?
"mode" is having this party for global warming.
Oh, it's not for global warming obviously, 'cause global warming is bad.
it's for awareness. Yay!
anyway, um, I'm in charge of finding the band.
it's gonna be fun, and so I was thinking
if I could play?
you want Dark Sexual Journey to play at a "Mode" party?
Oh, my--this is amazing. -Oh, no, Jesse. I think
do you know what kind of exposure this will be for us, for--for me? You're the coolest girl ever!
Oh. Oh, my god.
Betty, I-I was just so depressed today, you know?
like, I was, like, this close to just...
uh, whatever.
I'll put it in a song, but oh, my
you really, really cheered me up.
I mean, you're a snow day, Betty.
Hey, Daniel. Good news.
we're no longer bandless.
I found someone to play at the party on Friday.
you know what? Already done.
guess what? We got Mariah Carey.
it turns out Connor knows her. Isn't that great?
Yeah, I mean, Mariah's all right.
but can we just put a pin in her for a second?
because I think I found someone way fresher
Jesse's band-- Dark Sexual Journey
huh. They're awesome, and they're about to break out any minute.
you'll love them.
okay, um, great. Yeah.
let me just get Mariah on the phone.
Hey, Mariah. It's Daniel.
Yeah, it turns out we're not gonna need you to sing.
Uh-huh. We got Jesse, the guy from my assistant's building.
he is so cute. Yes, he is just the dreamiest.
I hate when you're sarcastic.
I can't move in with Cliff, right?
I mean, this is just such a big step.
sometimes I think, I love this guy, and then sometimes I think, what am I doing with him?
am I terrible? -No, baby, you're just scared.
I am. -Look, all I know is that living with a fatty is hard.
they're always hogging the bed and making a mess and -borrowing your clothes. -By the way, loving this dress.
it's Betty's blouse. I totally belted it.
it's great. -Right?
is it good?
very. I made a few calls, cashed in a few favors
Oh, yeah. Right. Sorry.
you're not about the process.
there's lots of juicy tidbits about Connor's past.
Oh, females.
have Connor come to my office after work.
I think I can make a persuasive argument as to whom he should be aligning himself with.
I don't think you've got any choice, Betty, but to tell the truth. He can't play at the party.
I know. Two shawarmas with everything, please.
but you should have seen his little face.
he's gonna be so disappointed.
and he's gonna hate me before I even know if he likes me.
bring it. Who's gonna hate you?
no one. Why are you always around?
Betty, we're roomies now. This is what we do.
I'm supposed to be all up in your biz.
so why the brown face?
Betty told this boy that she really likes that he could play at the "Mode" party, but Daniel got Mariah Carey.
what? Well, she's gonna find out sooner or later, isn't she?
Yes, I will. So it's a musician?
are you wearing my blouse?
don't change the subject.
here's what you do-- invite him to play at the after party.
there aren't any after parties.
um, what about the one we are having on our roof?
it totally just came to me.
your guy will have a place to play.
and I can charge money at the door and pay off my credit cards.
aren't you so glad that I moved in?
Bye.
damn it!
you okay?
no, I'm wet.
why did you replace our nice bottled water with glasses we now have to fill ourselves?
why don't you just hang a hamster bottle in the corner and we can all take turns sipping off of it?
mom, relax, okay?
it's probably just one of Connor's cost-cutting ideas.
Oh, like that memo telling us we now have to sign out a key for the supply room?
is that Connor's idea as well?
I told him he didn't have to run everything by me.
you be careful, Daniel. This is a pattern with you.
whenever you admire someone, you tend to give your power away.
just like you did with your brother.
that's not true, and that's beside the point.
I hired Connor because he's the best, and because I can trust him.
that's good.
then I suppose you're not worried that he and
Wilhelmina are meeting together tonight, privately.
or did you not know that?
you see, I make it a point to know everything Wilhelmina Slater is up to.
and if they're meeting alone, I don't like it.
there are a million reasons why they could be meeting.
don't worry.
Connor's got my back.
mode AFTER PARTY! 10PM after 'Fashion Heats Up', 750West 27thStreet, Roof
what is this?
it looks like a flyer for a rodeo at a women's prison.
what? I like it.
Betty, no one will come to a party with a flyer like this.
fine. How would you do it?
the roof, Friday, get on, the list
but how will people know where to go?
they won't even know what time to show up.
if they want to be there badly enough, they'll figure all that out.
you have to make it hard to get on the list.
that way, the party will be full of people desperate to be there.
and they'll think it's great.
no matter how much of a humongous turd it turns out to be.
um, I don't know.
trust me, roomie.
what is the roof?
who has the list?!
are you on the list -bitch I'm always on the list -can you hook me up? -what's the 411 on roof -what's roof? -hot new club -can I be your +1? -too late -get me on that list! -see you there
party List 300 people. Cool, right?
Wow. That is a lot of people.
Yes, it is.
I'm glad we're gonna have this chance to get to know each other better, Connor.
I find it helps improve a work relationship.
me, too. -Good, 'cause, you know, I'm confused.
I was, um, I was led to believe that you and Daniel
just how bad is that headache?
I'm sorry?
Oh, you've been doing that... a lot.
well, it's been quite a day.
I can get rid of that for you.
no, thank you. That's what drugs are for. -Come on.
let me. I'm better for your liver.
you know why you get them?
too many ideas in your head and not enough time in the day to get them out.
even if you could, who would you trust them with?
that's a lot of pressure, having only yourself to depend on.
I get headaches, too. There.
so how is it?
it's gone.
good. Shall we continue our talk?
now... My guess is a woman such as yourself would have a bottle of '61 single malt scotch floating around the place somewhere.
um, '48.
perfect. Older is always better.
I wouldn't know.
I've been the same age for years.
you know, Wilhelmina, you're the reason I'm here.
something tells me I could learn a lot from you.
are you okay? You seem distracted.
uh, it's just because I-I-I just remembered that I have a dinner.
I'll--I'll call Marc and have him, uh, reschedule.
300 people?
I-I thought I was making food for 50, m-maybe 60 at the most.
well, you can thank Amanda.
I had no idea it was gonna get this big, but, papi, what am I gonna do?
I promised Jesse.
sweetheart, why are you going to so much trouble for a boy?
because she likes him, papi.
I do. I do like him, and I shouldn't even be saying that.
a guy is the last thing I should be thinking about.
Why? You're young, you have a good job, your own apartment.
Yeah, and you're wearing heels sometimes.
thank god.
he's nice to you, mija?
so nice, but I can't. I can't do this.
I have to cancel. I can't afford this party.
you guys are thinking about this all wrong okay?
it doesn't have to cost that much.
you know, I was reading in "Vanity Fair" one time that going budget is totally in now, like, cheap is the new chic.
well, cheap we can work with.
maybe I can get a discount at Flushing Burgers, cut up a bunch of jumbos.
do a mole for dipping.
Oh, and we can make a ton of sangria.
cheap wine, old fruit, a box of sugar
people get drunk. They don't care.
drinking is bad.
okay, so we have a theme-- South of the Border.
Oh, and then we can use the decorations from my Quinceanera.
Oh, good idea.
that's such a great idea.
tacky Mexican stuff is so kitschy.
what? I'm allowed to say that. It's my heritage.
Oh, and, guys, thank you.
you always come through for me.
you're like a total snow day.
that's a good thing.
Oh. Oh. Okay.
so how did it go with Connor?
did you break him? Did he cry?
do I need to offer him a comforting hug?
check my calendar, please.
what, that's it?
you're not gonna tell me anything after all the work I did to dig up that dirt?
I didn't use it. It wasn't the time.
so when will be the time?
since when are you such a nosey parker?
your job is to do what I say and not ask any questions.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Oh, no.
Connor, my, uh, my door is always open.
I just wanted to let you know I'd be out most of the day.
Hey, how was that dinner last night?
it was fun... just delightful.
thank you for asking.
I'll see you at the "Fashion Heats Up" party.
fun? Delightful?
you didn't have a dinner last night.
you don't even eat dinner.
Oh, my god, you like him.
don't be ridiculous.
Willie, you saluted him.
you haven't saluted anyone since Cheney.
you have fallen for him like everyone else here.
I don't fall for anyone, Marc.
I'm not like those other women out there, ruled by their emotions.
Willie, it's okay to feel something.
no, it's not, not when it gets in the way of ambition.
how do you think I got this far?
now I've had my momentary lapse of judgment, but that is over now.
so what are you gonna do now?
finish what I started.
that party is gonna get a lot more interesting.
Marc.
Oh. I didn't even see you there.
what's going on, Marc?
I mean, I-I asked you a really important question and you--you don't call me back for three days?
I'm so sorry. It has just been nonstop around here.
what, with the blackmailing, backstabbing and going on Pinkberry runs.
I've barely even had time to take the curlers out of my hair.
is there still one back there?
why is the idea of moving in with me so hard?
It--it's--it's just big.
it's like deciding to get a kid.
how do you know it's the right time or what kind to get?
I mean, do you go Russian,
chinese or stay local and do something South American?
and then what if you're wrong, -and it clashes with your furniture-- -Forget it, Marc.
you gave me your answer.
so I have a car picking you up at your party at 10: 30 so you can be at my party by 11: 00.
do you think it's weird that I've left two messages for Connor, and he hasn't called me back?
no, he's probably just in a place where he can't answer.
I'm his boss.
he should be letting me know where he's gonna be all day.
is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine. It's just something my mom said.
you know what?
you should go home and get ready for your party.
I will. And, oh, Daniel, thank you so much for that donation.
well, it is the "Mode" after party.
besides, I heard the singer of the band is just to die for.
why do I tell you anything?
I'm sorry. You're not on this list.
but perhaps a crisp George Washington could persuade me.
that means a $20!
okay, here you go.
not so fast, gorgeous.
mama owes the government.
see, the--the--the trick to a good mole is cinnamon.
Hey, man, can I wear your hat?
don't touch the hat.
my God. What a turnout.
it's like everybody's showing up.
I think one of the understudies from "Spamalot"
just used my bathroom. -No.
Oh, and have you seen Jesse?
cause I think the band wants to start.
Oh, yeah, I think I saw him downstairs.
Betty, he's so cute!
all sad and tortured-- I see why you like him.
right? -I know.
Oh, finally. Connor left me a message.
why wasn't he at that dreadful party?
if I had to sit and listen to Scarlett Johansson babble about climate change, he should have.
he said his meeting went late.
he's gonna see me at the after party.
drama at Casa Del Meade.
word on the boulevard is that Meade Publications is selling off some magazines.
my anonymous source Reginald has confirmed that
Meade's new CFO- Connor Owens, met with "Conde Nast" for several hours this afternoon.
he's working with Wilhelmina?
I'm sorry, Daniel.
Oh, he's gonna be, too.
Hi. Welcome. Welcome. Have fun.
Jesse.
what are you doing out here? The band's ready to start.
are you okay?
It's--th-that's too big. I-I can't do that.
of course you can. -No, I--what if I suck?
there's no way you could suck.
you're just-- you're just having a little bit of stage fright.
I-I'm a fake, Betty. I-I just don't think I have it.
Yes, you do.
look, maybe you can't feel it right now, but it's in there. I can see it.
and--and these bad thoughts, that's what's fake.
as soon as you get up there and start playing, everyone else is gonna see what I do.
all right.
okay.
Whoo! -Okay.
God, Betty, you're so beautiful.
thank you.
but I'll try my best
either you live your life or you sit witness
while a look-alike comes and steals your bliss
so come on
get on with it
we're just wasting time
isn't he amazing?
Yeah, but Ivanka Trump just put a burger in her purse.
so I have to go call Randy. Okay, love you. Bye. -Okay.
get on with it
we're just wasting time
Hey, so I think I figured out who Betty's crush is.
it's that old guy over there.
that's her father.
Mandy, Cliff won't call me back.
he's mad because he thinks
I don't want to move in with him.
but you don't.
well, why should I? Everything was fine before.
we had our lives and our hair products separate.
everyone looked good and nothing changed.
why does he want to ruin that?
Oh, Marc, are you really mad at Cliff, or are you starting to have doubts about him?
Oh, my god! They put out cake.
do what you want.
I'm sure you'll make the right decision. Bye.
Whoo! Yeah!
Thanks.
so, uh, I wanted to try a little solo something, uh, and, uh, dedicate this to someone here who's...
w-well, she's just really special.
every day just blurs into one
the moon starts to look just like the sun
full steam ahead day to night
never fully charged
never quite right
but she was a snowy day
a break from working hard
for such little pay
she was a snowy day
she let me get some rest
she let me sleep real late
so I could fight another day
she was a snowy day
is everyone enjoying themselves?
who cares! He dedicated a song to you! He likes you!
I don't know. But I mean, I think he does.
earlier, he told me I was beautiful.
what more do you need, girl?!
go ask him out!
I-I know. I-I should, shouldn't I?
Yes!
okay, I will. I will.
uh, I should probably do that now?
Yes, yes. Ready? -Okay.
here I go.
go! Go!
Hi, Ms. Slater. How are you? Good to see you.
you a friend of Betty's?
what? Oh, god, no.
she's a nice girl.
I live right below her-- 4G.
am I to understand I'm on Betty's roof?
Yeah.
you look beautiful.
I think we're done with the charm, aren't we?
listen, I know you're in bed with Daniel, so let me be blunt.
you start playing for my side, or I will reveal some things about you, you probably don't want out there.
Wilhelmina, can we go somewhere and talk?
Connor, I know all about your meetings at "Conde Nast."
what the hell happened to our deal?
I'm not gonna have you two conspiring behind my back.
I don't care what your contract says.
I want you out of here.
Daniel, do you know how much it's gonna cost to fire a man like this?
Oh, he won't need to. I'll walk right now.
God, you two are children.
I played your game to get the job, but that is where it ends.
I took the meeting because you asked me to exercise my judgment, which is this--that selling off a couple of magazines makes financial sense, far more sense than preserving your father's legacy at any cost.
and you, whatever it is you think you've got on me, let it out.
I'll tell you what. I'll even help you.
drugs? I've done pretty much everything.
I've slept with my best friend's wife.
Oh, here's a great one. My first job at Smith Barney,
I overhear two guys in an elevator trading stock tips.
I end up losing my shirt, and I almost go to jail.
but I turn my life around.
I make myself into somebody that I can be proud of.
so if you want me to do the job you hired me for, fine.
but if you want me to pick sides, forget it.
I'm nobody's bitch.
I need a drink.
Jesse?
are you in there?
Oh! Sorry! -Jeez, Betty, ever hear of knocking?
Betty, w-wait. Betty, wait!
Betty, it was bound to happen sooner or later.
next time, I'll just leave a bra on the doorknob.
you are the worst roommate ever.
you are selfish and insensitive, and I want you out.
just be gone by tomorrow morning.
Connor, I wanna apologize for my behavior.
I always blackmail people when I'm nervous.
it's just kind of my go-to.
there aren't a lot of nice people in this business.
I...didn't expect to meet someone who actually has integrity.
thank you.
we need you.
so if you decide to stay, let's start with a clean slate.
I'd like that, as long as
I don't have to "knuckle bump" with Daniel anymore.
we still have to try that scotch.
it's a date.
will you excuse me? It's my fiancée.
so can I call you?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in the book.
hunter Farthington.
Marc?
cliff! What are you doing here?
I-I got your 20 messages.
sweetie, I'm--I'm sorry.
I-I-I should've known that-- that asking you to move in would--would cause a meltdown.
Hey, you... you're a neurotic mess, and I love that about you.
look, all that matters is that we love each other.
marry me.
what?
marry me, Cliff.
I wanna be with you forever.
Oh, I blew it up there with Connor.
I can't believe what a fool I made out of myself.
well, I'm pretty sure I'm a bigger fool.
I threw him a party.
are you crying?
I was so stupid to think that he would like me.
of course he likes Amanda.
Amanda?
they were kissing. I walked in on them.
I should've known that when he said I was beautiful, he meant on the inside.
you are.
you don't have to say that, Daniel.
I'm fine with who I am, but I'm not beautiful.
Betty... men are stupid.
they go for the obvious.
trust me. I know.
I'm still doing it, and I should know better.
but you're 24.
it's okay to have a crush, act a little stupid.
but you have to believe me when I say this
you are beautiful.
so...
I made, like, a ton of money tonight.
and... I'm a simple girl.
what do I need it for?
here. You should put it toward rent.
Hey, so remember that guy that I was kissing earlier?
Yeah, I don't think you know him.
anyway, I am so over him.
I was talking to him, and it turns out he's kind of stupid.
I mean, yes, he is the kind of guy a girl would totally fall for, but...
he is so not worth it.
Betty, I had no idea.
Amanda, look.
I was wrong.
you aren't the worst roommate ever.
and if you need to stay here for...
a little while longer, I'm fine with that.
you know, Betty, you're lucky.
when someone falls in love with you, it's real.
I've never had that.
I never know if I'm loved for who I am or because I'm so pretty.
why don't you finish cleaning up in here?
Betty.
have a seat.
Yeah, I was busy with my boyfriend.
do we have thatattorney-client privilege thing?
that only worksif I'm your lawyer, but for now you've got somethingstronger than that--my word.
marc bookedyour flight for paris.
you leave tonight at 9: 00.
I want something in return.
I want to see my son.
you need to find whatever it isyou're looking for, daniel.
I just know now that it's not me.
I think it's time for fey sommersto come out of seclusion.
Betty suarez here.
no, betty suarez here at home an hour ago.
Daniel hasn't left yet.
he's doing paperwork.
Yeah, well, the lawyer's gonna be here any minute to go over dad's immigration case.
I know, I know.
I'll get home as soon as I can.
and what about shopping for thanksgiving dinner?
Hilda, I will get it done.
look, I gotta go.
Ugh.
since I started here, she acts like all of a sudden I don't care about our family.
I always do the shopping for thanksgiving, and then every year my father and I cook the meal together.
it's been our tradition since my mother passed away.
I'm sorry, you were looking at me and saying things.
I wasn't really listening.
never mind.
so you've got big plans tomorrow with this new guy you've been seeing?
now what makes you say that?
you keep walking past daniel's office, saying really loudly that you've got big plans with this new guy you've been seeing.
not anymore.
jerk called about an hour ago.
says he has to spend thanksgiving with his wife and kids.
I'm, like, grow a pair.
I am so over men.
they all suck.
Where's marc?
Hi.
Hi.
Hey, what are you still doing here?
the high priestess needs her outfit altered for some dinner she's going to tomorrow.
Oh, what time do I need to be at your place?
around 3: 00.
now is that the time we're actually eating, or is that the time that that delightful little nephew of yours is putting on his production of "thanksgiving, the musical"?
we're eating at 6: 00.
I'll see you at 6: 00, then.
um, the phone stopped ringing a while ago, and it looks like everybody's gone for the holiday.
maybe I could...
Oh.
Yeah, sure.
okay.
you--you haven't, um...
seen...sofia up here today, right?
okay, and there's no calls?
sorry.
Oh, no, no, I don't care.
I mean, she's got a boyfriend, right?
who she never happened to mention, I might add.
I mean, if you're serious about a guy, you'd be talking about him all the time, right?
you're always going on and on about that guy wilbur.
Daniel, are you okay?
no, I'm not okay.
I spent the day waiting by the phone, checking my e-mail every two minutes.
it's like I'm this close to splitting a cobb salad with sarah jessica parkerand talking about shoes.
I really miss that show.
so whatcha doing tomorrow?
I have to drag my well-toned assup to schenectady, eat cranberry saucein the shape of a can and tell my familyall about my girlfriend, who lives up in canada.
you wanna blow 'em offand hang out?
tempting.
what are you thinking?
we meet here at 9: 00.
I bring the champagne, you bring the orange juice, and we watch the paradefrom wilhelmina's window.
and by "watch the parade,"you mean try on couture gowns and xerox our naughty bits?
of course.
I am so in.
french cuff or no?
no.
I'd go with the cuff.
you want to live my life, pay my bills.
Ooh, sassy.
uh, louis from armani called-- not happy withhis placement in the issue.
Dr. Levy needs to move yourteeth whitening to tuesday, and...
Oh, nico said to tell you she's coming in townfor thanksgiving.
what?
she told me last weekshe was staying at school.
I can't just change my plansat the last minute.
I have the versace partyto go to.
Ouch!
it's a work obligation.
I can'tshirk my responsibilities just to sit home and havea very brady thanksgiving.
she'll just have to understand.
what are you staring at?
Oh...
you're gonnacuff that, right?
Ahem.
okay, so don't forget, your dad has a brunch at 2: 00 P. M.
in the executive dining room.
I'm gonna pass on that.
what?
slimming.
Thanks. Marc.
you gotta go.
it's your family.
Oh, come on.
it's not likeit's some intimate gathering.
my father invitesall his editors so everyone can tell himwhat a genius he is.
Oh, and this year, my motherwill be fresh out of detox, stealing the olivesout of martini glasses and sucking 'em dryin the janitor's closet.
no, thanks.
knock, knock.
Oh, am I interrupting something?
Oh, hey.

Betty was just leaving.
Yes, I was.
Bye, betty.
Bye.

Hi.
Hi.

found out she has a boyfriendshe didn't tell me about.
wow, she sounds like a bitch.
I'm sorry, daniel.
I didn't knowwe were gonna do what we did, and thingsjust got out of control.
I was actually hoping that we couldskip to the part where we move onand we try to be friends?
I'd really liketo be your friend.
me, too.
friends' handsdon't go that low.
I'll see you atyour father's brunch tomorrow.

Oh, yeah, I'll be there.
I mean, it's my family, right?
Thanksgiving without familywould be...
Thursday.
great,'cause I'm bringing hunter.
and you know, in a weird way, I think you twowill really get along.
great, yeah.
I can't wait to meet him.
I can't stop saying his name.
I love him already.
see you there.
Hey, nice turkey.
you making one for everybody?
so you really invitedyour ex for thanksgiving.
look who took her grownup pill.
well, he is justin's father.
although these days a freakin'petri dish can be a father.
right?
so when did youget divorced, anyway?
Oh, no, you have to bemarried to get divorced.
no, this is the classic boy meets girl, boy knocks girl up, boy loses girl's number.
throw in a glass slipper, and you got a hell of a fairy tale.
exactly.
I'm home!
sorry!
did you go overyour case with leah yet?
an hour ago, betty.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't get off of work.
and you missedmy pageant at school.
I know, justin, but there wasno one to cover my phones.
well, it was awesome.
I was the only pilgrim that could do "jazz hands.
jazz what?
jazz...
hands.
Oh.
well, I wannahear all about this as soon as I get homefrom shopping.
Oh, hi.
you must be leah.
I'm betty.
I'm so sorry-- what did you do?
you went to the market?
that doesn't exactlysound like a thank you.
Hilda, I told youthat I would do the shopping.
well, since she startedthis new job of hers, she has no more time anymore.
Yeah, well, I have time.
I'm still doing all the cookingwith dad tomorrow.
Oh, really?
and what if theycall tomorrow from the office with some fashion emergency?
they've lowered the hemlines!
red alert!
why do you insiston making those every year?
no one ever eats them.
last year we had to use themto crack open walnuts.
because mom made themevery year, hilda.
it's a tradition.
and that was the best turkey they had?
no, that isthe last turkey they had.
you were this closeto stuffing a brisket.
Oh, I have so much to do.
well, I haven'teven started to cook, and I've stillgotta go to the airport.
all the kids are coming home tomorrow.
tell me about it.
we're having our three boysand their girlfriends.
I have no idea wherewe're gonna put these people.
well, we see 'em three times a year.
it's worth it.
Mm-hmm.
will you stop looking at me like the ghost of thanksgivingyet to come?
good night.
I see an old woman, all alone...
at a thanksgiving tableset for one.
Ciao, tesoro, it's wilhelmina.
Yes.
listen, something came up, and I won't be ableto make it tomorrow.
Nico's coming home.
Yes.
a carton of cigarettesand a bottle of vodka?
you have your traditions.
I have mine.
so...

no, gina, just the family.
I thought you would'vegone all out this year.
I mean, you never know who won'tbe around next thanksgiving.
what is thatsupposed to mean?
come on.
it's a small neighborhood.
people talk.
everyone knows aboutyour pop's immigration problem.
you know what?
you have no ideawhat you're talking about.
Hey, you wannakeep it quiet, fine.
but in the spiritof the holiday, I thinkI should tell you watch out for that lawyer I sawleaving your place last night.
Oh, really?
and why is that?
Leah stillman is bad news.
I know someone who knows someone who knowsdonna spadaro in astoria.
Leah promised to get hercustody of her kids, and all she did was stealher money and take off.
Yeah, well, hilda found leah, and I trust her.
Leah's not gonna rip us off.
well, don't sayI didn't warn you.
Oh, and tell your father I wish hima very happy thanksgiving.
what city?
Hi, in astoria, a donna spadaro, please.
hold for number.
shoot, sorry.
never mind.
Hi, daniel.
it's me-- betty, I need you now.
where are you?
I'm at the loft. Hurry.
it's an emergency.
Hello?
what's going on?
I gotta go.
Daniel just called.
he needs me.
it's thanksgiving.
I know, I know.
unbelievable.
what aboutcooking dinner with dad?
will you tell him I'm sorry?
look, it's the eva longoriafloat.
we love you, eva.
what if she hashidden cameras in here?
Oh, trust me, if she hadhidden cameras in here, I'd have been fireda long time ago.
Hey, what's thatweird float over there?
that's not a float.
that's betty.
you called me over hereto help you pick out a shirt?
this is your big emergency?
would you ratherI swallowed a bottle of pills?
it took you 45 minutes toget here.
I'd be dead already.
I left my familyon thanksgiving.
I had to cutacross the parade route.
I almost got run overby those "queer eye" guys riding a giant pilgrim.
okay, that came out wrong.
Betty, this is an emergency.
I have to sit acrossfrom sofia and her boyfriend at this brunch.
I've got to look good.
are you wearing cover-up?
I have a pimple, all right?
go away.
you know what?
I am going away.
good-bye.
no, no, wait.
what about the shirts?
and we haven't eventalked shoes yet.
I know this might comeas a surprise to you, but I have a life, too, and a familythat counts on me a lot.
they already think thatI put you in front of them.
my dad is in legal problems, my sister may have hired some shady lawyer, and it's up to me to fix it.
so I'm sorry if I don't thinkthat coming over here and helping you pick out a shirtto impress a girl is priority.
and can I just sayone more thing?
no, I don't reallywant to hear any more-- you're an amazing person, daniel.
Ah, if you justwanna blurt it outjenson you're smart, you're handsome, you were voted one ofthe top ten bachelors in the city by some magazine.
esquire.
I cannot believe that sofia actually has you questioningwhat a catch you are.
trust me, hunter is the onewho should be nervous about sitting across from you.
thank you, betty.
go with the purple.
Really?
I came all the waydown here.
okay, no, no, I'll wear the purple.
Hey, mom, is it okay if I sitbetween dad and christina?
I really want to talk to her about stella mccartney'sspring line.
great.
I'm sure your fatherwill be very proud.
Hilda, what are you doing?
forget the spoon.
get your handsin there and feel it.
I'm not feeling it.
I just got a manicure.
Where's your sister?
she's got hands like meat hooks.
he's here!
dad's here!
he actually showed.
how about that?
don't.
I guess whenwe want him to leave, we can just tell him you'repregnant and watch him run.
he's good at that.
ancient history, papi, okay?
and let's not forgetthe reason he's here is to give us the moneyto pay for a lawyer so that you don'tget deported.
well, look at you, little man.
Hi, dad.
what happenedto that little shrimp I saw last time I was here?
that was, like, a year ago.
this is to make up for some lost time.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh.
Thanks.
place never changes.
the only thing missingis your old man sleeping in front of the tv.
because the old man is busycooking dinner.
you look good, man.
glad you could make it.
Hi.
um, are you donna spadaro?
you don't know me.
I'm betty suarez.
yeah?
I'm so sorryto be bothering you, but I just wantedto ask you about a lawyer you mighthave used--a leah stillman?
are youfrom the bar association?
I called you peoplethree months ago.
no, no, no, no, I was justthinking about hiring her.
don't do it.
I was fightingfor custody of my kids.
she tells me, no problem.
I'll win.
guarantees it.
she filessome papers, takes all my money, and I never hearfrom her again.
Really?
she promised she'd have 'em homewith me for thanksgiving.
Hey, cool, a costume.
actually, it's a uniform, man, from the jets.
they're the best.
except for the giants.
Hey, look at this.
I got you a helmet and a football.
cool!
Momjenson look, I'm the phantom of the opera.
Hey, look who's here.
Hi, santos.
sorry.
so word is, you're a big career girl now.
Yeah, not that big.
Where's hilda?
I needto talk to you about-- hi, leah!
Hi.
she came over to pick up the rest of the moneythat santos brought.
hope they pay you double timefor calling you in on a holiday.
you know, I should really get going and let youget to your dinner.
Oh, okay.
I'll get you the rest of the money.
wait!
Aah!
uh...
I need to talk to youfirst.
upstairs.
so whatoh, so now you're listeningto that skank, gina gambarro?
no, hilda, I went to the woman'shouse, and I saw her myself.
well, maybeit's a different leah.
maybe they got the name wrong.
I just think that before we givethat woman all of our money well, I just think this ismore about the fact that I found leah and you didn'T.
what?
Oh, yeah, this is all makingsense.
I found the lawyer, I'm saving dadfrom being deported, I even helped dadwith the cooking.
you're not the golden childanymore.
you can't deal with it.
Hilda, I am just trying to help.
well, maybewe don't need your help.
you can't justget involved with the family when it's convenient for you, betty!
so save your guiltfor someone who cares.
I wish I hadn't given upmy lessons.
I could have been on broadway.
Oh, well, you did datethat chorus boy from "miss saigon" for a while.
that kind of counts.
what's your biggest regret?
uh...
drinking a bottle of champagneon an empty stomach.
no, seriously.
there's gotta be something you wishyou hadn't given up.
Oh, sweetie.
I'm so stupid.
I knewwhat the rules were.
I didn't meanfor it to happen.
I just fell in love with him.
me, too.
what?
what?
huh?
nothing.
you look pretty.
you wanna try onsome armani?
how are you doing, mother?
Oh.
adjusting to lifeon the outside?
I'm on my fourth club soda.
I pee every three minutes.
Ah, you'll getthrough it.
hmm.
you know, I don't think I've ever been to one of your father'swork functions sober.
I always thought there weretwice as many people.
dad.
drinking club soda, too?
very supportive.
happy thanksgiving.
happy thanksgiving.
I think it justgot a little happier.
Hey, you.
you must be hunter.
I've heard so much about you.
I really like that vest.
no, no, I'm gordon levine, editor of "tech wiz," the 14th floor.
hunter's over there.
man, how are guys like ussupposed to score with someonelike him around?
desperate times callfor desperate measures.
Hello?
Martha, it's wilhelmina.
Oh, hi, wilhelmina.
this iswhy I should always screen.
so, martha, happy thanksgiving.
Yeah, yeah, you, too.
listen, I only have a second.
my guests are arriving, and I still have to hollow outthe pumpkins for the soup course.
sorry to bother you.
you're cooking!
Hey, maybeI could run a fashion magazine.
it'll be like"freaky friday.
well, for your information, I was doing fineuntil I noticed the bird still hadits luggage inside of it.
sorry...
you want meto put my hand where?
and then we realized, it's not a halloween costume.
he really is a homeless guy.
no, and he stole my purse.
ha ha ha ha!
Yeah, that's funny.
so where didyou two kids meet, anyway?
Aw...
on a plane, coming home from kenya.
she was therefor a photo shoot, and I was workingwith the peace corps.
he sharedhis complimentary nuts with me, and then he cried when theyshowed "bridget jones' diary," and I was hooked.
Mmm.
so you workedfor the peace corps.
well, I figuredthere had to be more to life than modelingand racing sports cars.
well, you know.
Yeah.
Ah.
I spent a year setting upthis irrigation pump.
seeing thesetribal kids' faces when they saw fresh water for the first timejenson oh, baby.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
once, I helped these kidsopen up a hydrant on, um, 76th street, and they were just like,"wow.
I saw her just now.
she's alive.
what are youtalking about?
I saw fey.
no, you didn'T.
she's dead, bradford.
I can't believeyou're doing this to me.
I tried to go after her.
she just...
disappeared.
like somewishful hallucination.
are you okay?
he's just had too muchto drink.
I've got him.
ironic, isn't it?
Hilda thinks I'm jealous?
why, because for once she's actually carryingher weight around here?
I mean, maybe it is timethat the family stopped depending on me for everything.
I just asked whereI should put my coat.
I don't know.
ask hilda.
she knows everything.
run while you can.
not bad.
Hello?
anyone home?
I'm in the kitchen.
the kitchen?
what, did youget lost or something?
what, are you stayingfor a month?
laundry.
the washing machinesat the dorm are skanky.
I'll throw in a load later.
okay, happy thanksgiving.
I've gotta run.
Waitjenson run?
I'm meeting sarah and veronicaat the concert.
what concert?
we're going to see death cab for cutieat the beacon.
that's why I came into the city.
why, what'd you think?
nothing.
I figured you'd have plans.
I mean, you always have plans.
and I do.
of course I do.
I have donatella'sthanksgiving party to go to, which I'm horribly late for.
mom, are you okay?
Nico, I'm fine.
I just made a little snack in case...
well, I'm sureit's not very good, anyway.
I'm gonna go change.
Hey, come try these on with me.
if I keep doing it by myself, then I'm just a freak.
you made me think of daniel.
now I'm depressed.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
don't get depressed.
up, up, up, up, up, up.
get up, get up, get up, get up.
up, up, up.
I'm gonna tell you a secret.
Betty makes $50 a weekless than I do.
big news.
I checked that outher first week here.
okay.
Joelle from stylesgot knocked up-- no ideawho the father is.
eh.
Yeah, okay.
I think wilhelmina'sa lesbian.
what?
a big one!
what are you talking about?
okay.
she getsthese calls all the time from this womanon her cell phone, and she always kicks me outwhenever she calls, and we're like this.
hell, she even had me bring herher diaphragm to the plaza when she was sleepingwith that guy from texas.
So--oh, wait.
there goes my lesbian theory.
so who is this woman?
Oh!
my god.
the pain is totally gone.
you're amazing!
I told you.
so are you readyto get out of here?
Oh, how about we burnsome of this turkey off and go dancing later on?
well, you know I can't dance.
Oh, come on.
take meto that place that I love that you never take me to.
I can dance.
what?
I'm good at dancing.
I love dancing.
I think the three of usshould go dancing.
I thinkthat's a great idea.
okay, well, I'm outta here.
happy turkey day.
Oh, leah, thanks again for everything.
now if you need me, I'll be eatinga turkey sandwich at my office, getting your papers readyto file for your green card.
you really think if we go to court, I'll be okay?
I have never losta single case yet.
Oh, really?
what about donna spadaro?
Betty-- excuse me?
I'm sorry, hilda.
I cannot just sit here and watch her lie to us.
Leah, I am so sorry-- no, no, it's okay.
so, betty, what exactly do you know about donna spadaro's case?
that you couldn'thave won her case, because you took her moneyand you disappeared.
it's true that I didn't winthat case, because I quit before it ever went to trial.
I wasn't interested in letting an alcoholic gain custodyof her children.
an alcoholic?
a week before her court date, donna spadaro lefther three kids locked in her car in 90-degree heat while shegot bombed in a local bar.
the moneythat i stole from her merely coveredfiling and court costs.
but I bet you didn'thear that part, huh?
no.
I didn't.
I'm sorry.
listen, maybe you shouldfind a new lawyer, one that betty approves of no, no, you arethe lawyer we want.
Betty is onsome crazy power trip.
this has nothingto do with you.
please, leah, we need you.
Yeah, and you know, you can't have thanksgivingdinner at the office.
why don't you come back tonightand you have dinner with us?
we would love to have you.
well, it sure beatsa sandwich.
you know what?
I-I'd like that.
good.
meet meat the cemetery tonight.
I'm going to find outif she's alive, one way or the other.
and here was me, afraid that spending the holiday alone with my catwas gonna be depressing.
Hilda, it's almost 7: 00.
Yeah, I knowwhat time it is.
Leah said she'd be here.
she'll be here.
Hello?
it's daniel.
of course it is.
what's wrong?
well why would you tell her youcan dance if you can't dance?
no, I can dance.
I just didn't know we werecoming to this kind of club.
you gotta teach me.
Daniel, I can't teach youhow to mambo on the phone.
what am I gonna do?
okay, okay, okay, okay, don't panic.
look, have you evereven tried to mambo?
Oh, yeah.
back in prep school we had a big mambo contestevery year.
the basic idea of salsa is that the manis trying to seduce the woman, and the womanis pushing him away.
so take your left foot, and you tap on the first beat.
my left foot.
step forward with the same footjenson forwardjenson rock back on your right, and bring your left to close.
back on my right foot, left to close.
and thenyou just reverse that, just like that.
on my right foot, yeah.
I think I could do that.
look in a mirror.
are you biting your lower lip?
no.
Yes, you are.
don't do that.
Hey.
Oh, hey.
put...
it...
down.
how does she do that?
she's a little bitof a witch.
give or takea letter.
Oh, hold on, wait, wait.
there you are.
isn't this place hot?
Oh, yeah.
it just kinda makes me wanna tapon the beat with my left foot, rock back on my right.
can't begreat at everything, right?
Hey, you, come here.
I need a mojito, and then you're next.
what the hell was that?
you told meyou were a lousy dancer.
I am.
I was this close to makingthe ballroom dancing finals in vienna in 1988and blew it with my paso doble.
I stink.
I still don't know why the hellwe had to do this tonight.
because I start my christmasshopping tomorrow, and I want to know whether I need to geta gift for fey.
where the hell's the body?
save the tired theatrics.
you think I'm an idiot?
you've been working for herthe whole time.
you don't know what you're talking about.
where is she?
she's dead.
have it your way.
what the hell?
you told someoneabout this?
Mr. Green isa recent hire of mine.
to do what?
to clean up messes.
I just thought I'd reheatthe gravy, what's wrong?
I just tried leah's cell--twice-- and her office number all disconnected.
go ahead and say it.
I told you so.
get methe hell out of here.
Daniel, we need to talk.
what, did hunterjust save an orphan from a burning building?
forget it.
come on.
move over.
you walked out of thereso upset.
I thought we weregonna try to
tell me that doesn't mean anything.
tell me, and I'll drive awayright now.
when we pass byeach other in the halls, we can pretendwe don't even know each other.
of course you know that meant something.
then what are we doing, sofia?
we're not in fifth grade.
why are you with that guy?
because I love him, and this morning, in his dresser, I found a ring.
is that what you want?
Yeah.
Really?
Yes.
don't let my motorcycle and the gucci sunglassesfool you.
I'm an old-fashioned girl.
I want the white picket fence and lots of babies, and hunter offers me that.
you...
I don't think you're anywhere closeto being there.
I don't thinkyou know me that well.
are you telling me that you are readyto settle down?
come on, daniel.
this is where you stop me fromwalking back into that club.
what's all this?
well, turns out I don't haveto meet my friends for a while.
thought I'd have a snack.
you wanna join me?
I told you I had plans.
come on.
it's donatella.
there's gonna be seven modelsfighting over a celery stick.
well, I suppose I have a minute.
I can't believe you did all of this.
it was nothing.
mother.
stop.
thank you.
so how's everything at that overpricedboarding school you're at?
tell me about your classes.
well, calculus sucks, but psych is pretty cool.
Oh, and I havethis history teacher-- you can have your headphonesin his class, and he...
what are you doing?
will you stopwith those things?
Leah stole our money.
we can't evengo to the police because we can't tell themdad's illegal.
it's still thanksgiving, hilda, and we're still a family, and I'm makingmom's dessert.
I can't believeI was so stupid.
I should've checked her out.
it could happento anybody.
a lot of peoplebelieved her story.
we're just so desperate, and I wanted to come throughfor once, you know?
to be the big hero.
well, you can help mefinish these.
fine.
you know, if anyone'sto blame, it's me.
Oh, shut up.
I'm serious.
I'm gonna hit you.
at leastyou've been trying to help.
I didn't make itto justin's pageant.
I mean, maybe this stupid jobisn't worth it.
well, you can't live your lifefor your family, betty.
you've been taking care of ussince mom died, and maybe it's timefor us to stop relyingon you so much.
well, I like it that you rely on me.
taking care of the family is the one thingI knew I could do.
I wasn't ever gonna bethe pretty one.
okay, look.
maybe you don't haveto take care of everything.
maybe we're strongerthan we think.
hell, I put these nailsin stuffing today.
big deal.
I'm gonna kick your butt.
I'm not gonna answer that.
it's okay.
tell daniel I said hi.
here it is.
I found it--her cell phone bill.
that's the number!
2: 00 A. M.
6: 00 in the morning.
I can't believe you're doing this.
Wilmont surgical center.
Hi.
this is wilhelmina slater.
Yes, ms.
I'll put you right through.
she's putting me through.
through to who?
I have no idea.
why are you calling me from the office?
she knows we calledfrom the office.
yes?
why did you just hang up on me?
I didn't.
well, someone did, and they were callingfrom your office.
excuse me.
Hi, I'm betty.
somebody called me.
Yeah, that was me.
he's over there.
is he okay?
well, he was orderingscotch rocks for a while, and then when he startedordering "crotch socks," I figured I'd call someone, so...
yours was the number dialedin his cell the most, so I just figured...
Thanks.
Hi.
I wore that purple shirtyou picked out for me.
your shirt looks great.
do you wanna get out of here?
I didn't tell herwhat she wanted to hear, betty.
it wasn'ta very good thanksgiving.
Yeah.
I didn't have a very goodthanksgiving, either.
come on.
let me out of here!
let me out of here!
No!
let me out!
let me out of here!
well, I did consider throwing a dart at the real thing,
but she's so damn fast in those heels!
Christina, I know you're upset.
but you've missed a lot of work,
and it's not that I mind covering for you,
because I don't,
but I hemmed a skirt yesterday with a staple gun.
I'm sorry, betty. it's just... it's been really hard since she's banned me from seeing the baby.
we've become really attached to that wee bugger.
it's gonna take time
and some intensive scottish therapy.
you're up, Stuart.
look, maybe coming back to work
would help get your mind off things.
Matt's dad's coming in to sign the deal
that's gonna help save meade, and we're throwing a party!
and I ordered a coconut cake just for you.
no one else even likes coconut.
Oh, well, you do make a good argument.
I just want to see you be happy again.
I hate seeing you like this. is there anything I can do?
listen, you coming for a drink with me is more than enough.
you're one of the good ones. - Stop.
to friends.
to best friends.
Ooh, another one, I think.
two more, please?
everybody, I'm home!
Oh, good, you're here!
why do you smell like junior high?
Hi, how's christina?
better. I hope she comes to work tomorrow. - Oh, good.
Ahem! okay, now that everybody is here
Justin!
what? - We have an announcement to make.
you're getting married! - You're getting married?
settle, settle. we are not getting married.
Oh. oh.
Oh, my god, you're pregnant! oh, she's pregnant!
Hilda, are you pregnant? - Oh, my god.
no. you guys, cut it out! I'm not pregnant.
listen,
tomorrow... archie is going to announce
the launch of his campaign...
for president!
borough president. - oh!
it's still president. - Oh, wow, that's so great!
how exciting, Archie.
congratulations, mr. president.
Hey, hey, huh? look, he had T-shirts made.
Oh, let me see. - I don't have to wear that, do I?
Hey. vote Archie Rodriguez
an a-rod you can believe in." - Very clever.
I don't get it.
now I have a surprise for you.
as part of the launch, news 12 is doing
a feature on me tomorrow. I want you to be in it.
are you serious? - Yeah, you've inspired me.
I figured if I could get someone like you,
I mean, what the hell, anything's possible.
Ooh! yeah, I don't know what to say!
I'm gonna be first lady.
Yeah, okay, sort of. I have to win first.
okay, well, bigger picture. You're gonna be on tv tomorrow,
which means you have to look tasteful.
and let's just say your closet presents some... challenges.
Ow. hey, I could get you some outfits from "mode.
I'll have them messengered first thing in the morning.
you're gonna give me clothes?
no, I'm lending you clothes.
we'll see.
Christina?
have you seen Christina? - No.
why are you still not here?
why did I get coconut cake?
Hey, Hilda, did you get the dresses?
Yes, thank you, I did. but I got a question. hmm?
how booby can a first lady be?
or should I play up my arms like Michelle Obama?
well, why can't you do both?
God. I don't know why I am so nervous about all of this!
well, because Archie asked you to be on TV with him.
that's sort of a big deal. - I know, I know. it's like he asked me to be part of his future or something.
hold on. Closet.
uh, no, christina is not here...
right--right now.
can I, uh, tell her you called?
okay, bye. - She's still not in yet?
Yeah, I don't know how much longer
I can keep covering for her.
I mean, at some point, I have to draw the line, right?
listen, there's only so much you can do, you know?
at some point, she's gotta make her own decisions. - You're right.
so the camera adds 10 years, right? 10 pounds.
Oh, crap, I got a lot of work to do.
Oh, can you put that up higher?
okay, everyone, hartley's coming at 11: 00 a. m. sharp,
so please, let's pick up the pace.
good morning! - hey, betty, what do you think?
looks great. - Yeah, did you check out the omelet bar?
it's a nice touch, huh? - Everyone loves an omelet bar.
I really wanted you to put them in the fancy plastic - plastic covers?
Oh. relax, daniel. you're gonna be great.
you've got a wonderful presentation, - Amazing visuals and an omelet bar. - Betty, come on.
the man made me dress up in a bunny costume.
I have to prove to him that I deserve respect.
besides, nothing's official until he signs on the dotted line.
lower that, will ya? - Oh!
Oh, william. hi, william.
Hi.
Oh, thank you, betty.
that'll be worth at least ten years of therapy.
uh, daniel, will you hold him?
he is your half brother.
Oh, uh, o-okay.
before we start our presentation,
I want Hartley to hold him.
Why? - well, I heard he has a soft spot for kids.
apparently, all his charities benefit the children.
so once he gets a glance at my little angel,
he will be putty in our hands.
it's human nature. you put one in your arms,
and you turn into a grinning idiot... like that.
in daniel's defense, he always looks like that.
Oh, stupid nanny.
she packed a sweater with a loose button.
Mm. will you take this down to the closet - And have christina sew it up, please? - Right away, fraulein.
did you say, "frown line?" - No.
I can take it to christina. - oh.
I'm going down there now, anyway.
I can get it done in a jiffy! - aah!
she's strong.
Ow! son of a... mmm.
Oh, you're gonna need to build up calluses like mine.
Christina, you made it! - Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
now we can start by letting me have that.
Oh, no, no, it's okay. I can now come - just
Oh, it's the, uh... eh...
the baby's here.
Yeah. sorry.
no, it's okay. it's fine.
I can handle it.
I am a mature woman.
I just wish I'd brought my darts.
let's stay sharp. Hartley's here any second.
it's time to get serious, marc.
put on your game face.
not your gay face your game face.
they're the same face.
you're fine. - Thanks.
Oh, come on!
Hi, Steve! wrong floor.
come on. see ya.
there he is!
Wow. hell of a greeting. - Mr. hartley, so good to see you.
we're honored to have you with us. - Thanks, bunny.
Oh, great. we're still doing that. - Betty, always a pleasure.
Mr. Hartley.
Claire.
it's good to see you again. - Uh, you two know each other?
from way back. - Ages ago.
I'm surprised you remembered me.
it's so nice to finally meet you.
I am wilhelmina slater. - Damn, this is an attractive staff.
Aw... thank you!
should we, uh, take a tour,
or do you wanna go straight to the omelet bar?
why don't you start without me?
I'm gonna go check on my baby.
what is there a baby here? can I see him?
I love babies! - you do?
always have. maybe it's because they can't ask me for money.
over here? - oh. right this way. yes, yes.
daddy more-bucks is kind of old, but hot.
do us all a favor and wait till after he signs the deal - to jump his bones. - I make no promises.
here he is. ah.
is this a joke?
what's going on?
Marc, where's william?
uh, he was in here napping a minute ago.
has anyone seen the baby?
Oh, my god.
my baby's gone.
where is my baby?
Marc, you were supposed to be monitoring him! - I was, I was.
I didn't hear anything!
he--he was only alone for less than a minute!
how could you be so stupid?
I'll call security. - Have them lock down the building.
come on, marc, call the police. - got it.
Wilhelmina, don't worry. we're gonna find him.
I know where to start looking.
Christina!
I thought sucking up to the rich guy will take a bit longer william's been kidnapped.
what? when? - just now!
Oh, my god. she did it-- that ungrateful foreign woman.
Ow! what-- - not her, the white one.
arrest her! no! - no. just get your hands off me.
I-Ididn't do it! I was here the whole time!
Christina didn't do this. - we will let the cops decide.
no one leaves here until they speak to the police.
that includes you.
breaking news. today's hot color--amber
as in alert.
the golden child of wilhelmina slater
and the late bradford meade has been kidnapped.
all meade employees are being questioned.
information is scarce, but, I, suzuki st. pierre,
have an exclusive with an eyewitness.
Oh, hey, there. oh, before we start,
I'll only speak on the condition of unanimity.
do you mean "anonymity"?
exactly.
but you're on tv. everyone can see you.
I know.
okay, cut. cut. take five.
I'm getting an omelet.
I can't believe this. who would kidnap a baby?
I wouldn't put it past wilhelmina to do it herself.
mom, you're being ridiculous. besides, given your past,
you're a much more likely suspect.
you didn't do it, did you? - oh! of course not.
kidnapping isn't my m. o. at all.
it disturbs me that my mother has an m. o.
Mr. hartley. - yeah.
I'm so sorry about all this.
I'm gonna have betty reschedule the presentation.
why do we need to reschedule?
uh, no, just because of-- - yeah, look, don't get me wrong.
it--it breaks my heart that there's a child missing.
but tomorrow morning, I get on a plane for moscow.
so we're gonna have to lock this thing down today,
or that's it.
all right, um...
excuse me just a second.
ms. slater seems to think
that your friend christina mckinney
has something to do with the disappearance of her child.
no, she would never do anything like that.
she loves that baby. she's as devastated as anyone else.
which gives her even more of a motive. -look, she already told you,
she was in the closet the whole time.
do you even have any evidence that she did anything?
that's why we're talking to you, miss suarez.
detective, I have known christina for years.
there is no way she could've done this.
okay.
you can go.
but, uh, if you think of anything that might help,
here's my card.
Christina!
Hi, hilda.
Archie hated the dresses.
he says they're too fancy.
he wants to represent himself as a man of the people
and doesn't want me to be the next sarah palin.
Hilda, can we please talk about this later?
we're kind of in the middle of an emergency.
okay, what is the emergency? stripes are over?
no, wilhelmina's baby's been kidnapped.
Oh... god. then what are you talking to me for?
go! go!
Amanda, do you know where christina is?
Betty, when I marry mr. hartley,
I'm gonna be your mom.
uh, amanda, I need you to focus right now.
don't talk to your mother that way. go to your room.
Amanda, do you or do you not know where christina is?
fine. she just left.
the police released her?
I guess. she did seem pretty upset.
well, of course she's upset.
the baby is missing, and everyone's accusing her. hmm.
will you tell daniel I'll be back?
they grow up so fast.
okay?
Christina!
Christina, wait! - betty, what are you doing here?
was that stuart? - yeah, I'm just taking his car home.
I kinda needed to get out of there.
Yeah, I know. you're upset.
but do you think you should be driving? -betty, I'll be fine, really.
don't worry about me. just go back to work.
no, no, I can go back in a minute.
Betty, what are you doing?
I just want to make sure you're okay. - well, I am.
I'm--I'm okay. I'm okay.
no, christina, you don't seem okay.
you seem really worried, and I don't blame you.
Christina, what are you doing?
I just--i need to get out of here.
Christina!
you took the baby!
Christina, how could you do this? - I don't know!
when you told me the baby was in the office,
I-I just snapped.
and then when everyone went to the elevator,
I just took him, and then I called stuart.
you know, I defended you to the police.
I'm a part of this now.
I'm accomplice to a kidnapping.
Betty, it's not a kidnapping when it's your own son.
it's not your child. christina, there was a test.
the baby is wilhelmina's! - and you think that wilhelmina
is not capable of-- of faking a D. N. A. test?
Betty, she needs that child
to hold on to her place at meade.
this is insane. this is crazy.
we have to go back. you have to return the baby.
I can't. I can't go back. they'll arrest me.
Oh! oh, god. oh.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for you to get involved.
and this chart clearly shows
the fourth-quarter projections.
so as you can see, even in a bad economy, "mode" sales have increased.
we've already lined up kate beckinsale,
Penelope cruz, anne hathaway for the fall cover
is this a joke? we're talking about my child!
Hathaway-- she, um, she's hot.
sorry. uh, I mean, she's hot right now.
I'm sorry.
Mr. hartley... this deal is extremely important to me,
but, uh, my partner's son has been kidnapped
my half brother.
so you're asking if you can reschedule,
even though I told you
this is the only time I can do this?
Yes, I am.
you know what's gonna happen?
I'm gonna make time before my flight tomorrow morning.
Hi.
license and registration, please.
we've got a serious problem here.
your taillight is out.
Oh. just the taillight?
is road safety a joke to you?
no, ma'am. actually, I was sally the safety duck all through elementary school.
wait here.
Christina, can we please just take william back
before this gets worse?
Betty, he's my son.
Christina! - no, look, look.
okay, it's a picture of william. - it's a picture of me as a baby.
Betty, you know me.
you--you know that I would never do anything as crazy as this
if I wasn't 100% sure.
please?
I'm gonna let you off with a warning,
but only if you promise to get that taillight fixed.
I promise.
whose baby is this? - mine.
ours. the baby is ours.
will both you ladies step out of the car, please?
around to the front of the car, - please, ma'am.
you, too, miss. around to the front.
what were you ladies thinking?
come here.
with the lacorte infant car seat,
you gotta use the locking clip.
it's safer. my partner and I have the same one.
the car seat, not the baby.
all right, have a good one, ladies.
okay.
Oh, betty, thank you so much
for not saying anything.
Christina, look, I believe you, okay?
Yeah. but this is not the way to deal with things.
I just wish you would've come to me first.
next time. - let's just get somewhere safe so we can figure it out.
it's hour...
jeez, I can't read this watch.
let's just say hour four of the slater-meade kidnapping.
now the fuzz have been a little stingy about the details,
so we're forced to confine our reporting
to good, old-fashioned wild speculation.
now the boys in the f. x. department
have used age-progression software
to determine what the spawn of bradford meade
and wilhelmina slater would look like by 20.
mother of pearl, the man is an adonis.
the world cannot afford to lose this specimen.
if you're out there listening,
I make this demand of the kidnappers
bring him back. we're talking fashion royalty.
mom! mom.
I have to watch this! this is my o. j.
then go watch in the kitchen. they're about to start shooting.
we're gonna set up in the salon.
that's perfect, thanks.
nice work, getting them to shoot in my salon.
it's good for business.
well, your salon is an example
of my support for small business.
and it's the entrepreneurial spirit
that will pull this country right out of
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
you already got my vote.
just make sure
that they get a clear shot of my sign.
Oh, okay.
thanks for toning down the outfit, huh?
no problem.
thank you for asking me to be a part of this thing.
councilman, we're ready to check your mike.
okay, all right. Thanks. see you in a bit.
okay, just wipe that-- -Okay.
...this drama will unfold.
the question on everyone's mind is,
where in the world is that kidnapped baby?
if the baby snatchers have any sense of decency at all,
they'll take the genetically blessed bambino to...
you are kidding me.
we found this from the security camera
in the stairwell.
I brought it to you first
as per our usual agreement.
hit it.
uh, could you pause, please?
Troy, may we have a moment alone?
come on, you.
who's that?
that is christina's husband stuart.
great scott!
I'm sorry. I've always wanted to say that.
so she really did take the baby.
so that's great news. the baby's safe.
now all we need to find christina
is a team of booze-sniffing hounds.
it's okay. christina would never do anything
to hurt little william.
in a few hours, he'll be back safe
and sound in his nanny's arms.
we don't have a few hours.
if christina has the baby,
then the truth is going to get out.
what truth are you referring to?
I had the D. N.A. test faked.
the baby's not mine.
it's Christina's.
so let me get this straight.
you faked the D. N.A. test
in order to claim christina's baby as your own.
Oh, the bigger picture, fool.
if it gets out that this baby is not mine,
I lose my claim to the Meade Fortune.
I'm fired, and you along with me.
what are we gonna do?
we need to find out where that baby is
so they don't discover the truth.
how? christina could be anywhere.
okay. I'm a scottish seamstress/kidnapper
and I have a pasty complexion.
where do I turn?
you would turn to your best friend.
Betty. - Betty.
Oh, my god. you guys are the kidnappers?
I totally called that.
Shh! no, we're not kidnappers.
well, okay, technically, we're kidnappers,
but it-- it's very complicated.
this is so exciting.
I gotta go tell all my friends.
whoa, you go up to your room and you don't say a word.
you got that?
but all this drama
I can't even tell the drama club?
zip. - Fine.
you guys gotta get out of here.
if reporters think that Archie has anything to do with this,
his career is through, and then we are through.
Hilda, just keep them in the salon.
we'll sneak up the stairs.
they'll never even know we were here.
are you crazy? you can't stay in the house.
well, what are we supposed to do? - I don't care.
I just don't want Archie to see you here.
Hilda? is everything all right?
Yeah.
everything is great. never better!
fine, I will distract them. but this isn't over.
okay, everybody! Let's get those cameras rolling.
I'm feeling really good about this.
how about everybody faces me
as I stand against the window?
Oh, hey, have you seen Archie's poster,
how handsome he is?
come on, stop.
Oh, no, that's great. why don't we use while we're
you know what? actually, I prefer the window.
I like to be backlit. it's very... Spielberg.
was that a baby?
no, that was justin, my son.
Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green broke up again.
he was really pulling for them, so he's just...
well, here's what I was thinking,
is that we could actually come through the front door...
and then we can show that we're inside a house.
you know, you wanna go out the front door?
you know what? I just had an idea--genius.
Archie, you know what you should really show them?
the yield sign you had installed down the block.
why would they want to see a yield sign?
because it was your first act as councilman.
first small step on the way to greatness.
actually, I love it.
if you were smart, you'd hire her as your publicist.
well, o-okay.
see? come on. I'll show you the sign.
before it was there, there was no yielding.
it was chaos. you can't believe the neighborhood.
he has saved the day-- Archie Rodriguez.
you have something you'd like to tell me, mija?
Oh, hi, Stuart.
I'm afraid we've had a little bit of a detour.
kidnapping. ay, dios mio.
that's gotta be, like, 10, 000 hail marys. - Papi
okay, you know when you asked
where you should draw the line when helping a friend?
you just crossed it.
Hilda, we had no other options.
papi, you understand, right? - I'm trying to.
I'm not even gonna discuss the fact
that you kidnapped a baby, but then to bring him here
with archie's campaign on the line?
what was I gonna do?
she needed my help.
I couldn't just turn my back on her.
but, betty, she didn't just jump a subway turnstile.
this is kidnapping!
I know, but she thinks that baby is hers,
and I believe her.
mija, even if it is, what could you possibly do?
I don't know. get another D. N.A. test, something.
okay, so we just maybe
drop by the D. N.A. pagoda at the mall.
okay, hilda, okay. I get it. we need help.
Yeah, but who's gonna help a fugitive?
mode magazine.
Oh, hey, betty. yes, I'll connect you to claire.
Ow! my hair!
sorry. - Hello. this is claire.
Mrs. Meade, I really need your help.
Betty, you did the right thing by calling me.
Dr. gelobter is a close friend.
he'll get the test done quickly and quietly.
thank you so much, Mrs. Meade.
I really appreciate you sticking your neck out
like this for us.
well, betty's helped me many times in the past.
I'm only too happy to return the favor.
and once we prove that this baby isn't wilhelmina's,
we'll finally be able to get rid of that bitch.
police. Hold it right there.
put down the baby! put your hands up!
don't move! Ma'am, hand over the baby now.
give up the baby. Get back!
get your hands behind your back.
let's see those hands. - No, no!
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you
in a court of law.
so in theory, if you hadn't stopped us,
we'd already know the true identity of the baby's mother.
in fact, we were just trying
to help you resolve the situation.
lady, you can stop talking, huh? we get it.
you've been free to go for 15 minutes.
your friend over there has got a good lawyer.
so wilinlmina is agree to drop charges
against both of you
what about Christina？
Betty, She kidnapped Wilhemina's baby
Daniel，because she acturlly think
that the baby is hers.
Daniel, I believe her.
come on, you have to talk to wilhelmina.
there's gotta be something that you can do to help.
just don't hold your breath.
that woman won't give up anything
unless you've got something on her.
Wilhelmina, we are in front of a D. N.A. facility.
what harm could it possibly do?
I am not gonna indulge the lunatic
who took my son
just to give her peace of mind.
I know. i-i'm just saying,
then we'd be done with this whole ugly situation.
we could put it behind us.
I took the test already.
it proved that he was my son.
I know.
just because she's not happy with the results,
I should submit to another one?
look, daniel, she stole my son.
lord knows where she could've taken him.
and you want me to have sympathy for her?
as far as I'm concerned, she can rot in jail.
there's gotta be something we can do.
we're in handcuffs in the back of a police car, betty.
I think we might be out of options.
no, we're not.
we could get a court order or... something.
we can make this right.
I don't know what I was thinking...
taking on Wilhemina Slater.
I didn't stand a chance.
Christina...
you're a good friend, betty.
I just wanted him to have a happy life.
that's all.
ma'am, would you please step away from the vehicle?
I made a few more bottles,
and they're in the refrigerator,
and the nanny should be here at 7: 00 to take over.
thank you, marc.
is there something else?
n-no.
just...
congratulations, I guess.
you did it.
as far as anyone knows, the baby is yours.
the baby is mine, Marc.
of course he is.
and your position at the company is secure.
and Christina is going to jail.
win-win.
if you have something to say,
why don't you just come out and say it?
I...
have a good night, Wilhelmina.
good night, Marc.
I'm sorry, Hilda.
I shouldn't have brought them here.
I just didn't know what else to do.
it's just a good thing that Archie didn't find out.
if he thought that you brought a kidnapped baby here
with a news crew following him around...
he would be so, so
I would be so... what?
cute.
you are so cute.
did you change ties? Because it is--it is cute.
it is working for me. Sexy. I like it.
Hilda, I know.
conceited!
but still cute.
Justin told me everything.
he's always making up stories.
he's very creative. - Hilda, stop.
look, she had nothing to do with it, Archie.
it was me. It was my fault.
I wasn't trying to endanger your campaign.
I was just trying to help my friend.
I understand that. I think that's noble.
what? You were stressing about what dress I was gonna wear,
but now you're okay with kidnapping?
okay, okay, to be clear,
as candidate for queens borough president,
I am not okay with kidnapping, but...
as your friend,
I understand you have to do what you think is right.
but it doesn't really matter what's right,
because Wilhelmina won.
did you try fighting dirty?
excuse me?
well, I'm-- I'm just saying,
we all want to play by the rules,
but something I've learned in city politics is,
well, to get what you want,
sometimes it doesn't hurt to be a little... creative.
I know the truth.
what truth do you think you know?
that baby doesn't belong with you.
and that aubergine faux fur doesn't belong with anything.
yet here we are.
I can prove it.
you see this? This stain is the baby's spit-up.
and when I get it tested, it's gonna prove
that the baby is Christina's, and you will go to jail.
or...
you can admit that the baby isn't yours,
and we can chalk up that fake D. N.A. test to a mistake.
your choice.
looks like you got me.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
so we should give
that enchanting poly-blend thing
to your lab?
and when the D. N.A. results come back
and they say strawberry milkshake,
then what?
baby spit-up and milkshake
are completely different colors.
Oh, come on, Betty. I'm a fashion expert.
I notice everything. it's a gift and a curse.
all right, fine.
I don't have D. N.A. evidence.
but I'm not giving up.
I don't have your money, and I don't have your power,
but I know the truth,
and I will fight until it comes out.
Wilhelmina, even you don't want to have to lie
for the rest of your life.
it would be so much easier to just tell the truth now.
when I discovered the error in the D. N.A. test,
I was devastated, but I knew I had to say something.
because while I knew I'd be losing my baby,
there was simply no way
I could keep a child from his real mother.
in a final twist,
it turns out the baby appearsnotto be the scion Of Bradford Meade and Wilhelmina Slater
Boo-hoo--but rather some kid from a couple of scottish people.
now given this new information,
we've had to revise our previous depiction
of what the baby would look like at 20.
dear lord.
ladies and gentlemen,
it is a shame that this kidnapping story
has come to such a tragic conclusion.
I can't believe Wilhelmina told the truth.
Yes, the woman's a saint
Oh, all that matters is that her shares in the company
are little William's,
and without the baby, she's got nothing.
and I don't care how talented she is.
you keep a cobra around long enough, eventually they bite.
mom's right.
Wilhelmina's proven time and again she can't be trusted.
let me fire her.
no. I'm gonna do it. it's my responsibility.
fine. But I want to see tears.
Mr. Hartley,
before we sign the paperwork, there's just
a little bit of business we need to take care of.
Wilhelmina, can I speak with you?
you're fired.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. -Seriously?
your time at Meade is over.
well, that is a shame.
let's go, guys.
wait. Where are you going?
if you're gonna fire Wilhelmina, I'm out.
with all due respect, Mr. Hartley
this is an internal personnel matter.
but I have an opinion.
I thought we agreed you'd be a silent partner.
well, you'll find that sometimes I'm not so silent.
she's a shark. She can't be trusted.
son, I think a shark is exactly what you need
to balance things out around here.
what are you talking about?
look, you're a stand-up guy, Daniel,
and that's great, but I can't have you
hopping off to your bunny hole every time a problem comes up.
I own companies in Colombia, India, Brazil.
if I stopped doing business every time
somebody got kidnapped, I'd never get anything done.
so either Ms. Slater keeps her stake in the company
and her job,
or I walk.
pleasure. Claire.
Oh. I'm so glad you're here.
good for you.
I'd like to propose a toast.
okay, never mind.
glad to see you, Betty.
I've been meaning to thank you. - What for?
for the plucky little threat you made.
you were right. The truth always comes out.
and when you mentioned that it would be easier
not to have to lie for the rest of my life,
I took that quite to heart.
if you're going to invest in this company,
I think you need to know the truth about me.
what is that?
I'm the type of person who stole a dead man's sperm,
who falsified D. N.A. results,
who kept a mother in the dark just to maintain the illusion
that her baby was mine
all of this to ensure my place in this company.
why are you telling me all this?
because I'm someone you need on your side,
working for you
as opposed to an enemy...
working against you.
you encouraged me to tell the truth,
and because of that, Hartley decided to keep me on.
so thank you again.
Oh, and when Christina comes back, would you be a dear
and bring the baby to her?
I think it'd be best if she and I didn't see each other.
Bravo, Wilhel-maestro.
Bravo.
who's that? it's your mommy.
hello. There's mommy.
and I'm your daddy. yes, yes.
Hey, little guy. hey.
Betty...
I don't know how to thank you for everything.
you don't have to.
you know, you've come a long way since you first got to "mode.
I mean, you still dress the same, but still, a long way.
it's been really lovely knowing you as a friend. I mean that.
Christina, stop.
why are you talking like you're going away?
Christina...
Stuart and I are gonna go back to Scotland.
what?
Why?
we want to be closer to our families
so the wee one can get to know them.
Plus, I don't want him speaking like a yank, 'cause I can't understand a word you people say.
but what about your career? what about designing?
what, you think they don't have designers in Edinburgh?
listen, I've not given up on my dream.
that was something I learned from a very good friend.
come here.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you, too.
Betty, take it easy. I like it ugh, but only on the weekends...
if you know what I mean.
sorry, Sammy, but I gotta get going. I'm just anxious out getting to work.
aunt Betty, don't worry about it.
I'll just stay home from school and help out.
I'm not double-booking haircuts to make money to get you into private school just so you can get rejected 'cause you're too stupid 'cause you skipped public school.
here we go, ladies. A little dulce and cafecito on the house.
Hey, Sammy. Betty'll you about the big promotion?
no, what big promotion?
Yeah, well, I-I got promoted to associate features editor at "mode."
but don't you worry. I will be back to assistant in no time.
don't talk like that.
sit up. Well, it's true.
my first issue as editor is going to print, and I am the only one without anything in it.
Plus, matt is killing all of my pitches and basically making my life impossible.
you know you're hurting me, right?
Matt is a spoiled bitch.
mom.
I'm sorry. I'm just saying.
everybody is all sweet when you're in love, but it's when something bad happens
that's when a person shows their true colors.
I don't know who he is anymore.
well, I don't know if you guys know this, but currently, I'm working in the fashion industry.
what? - Oh, yeah.
I'm dointhe remodel on Evan Grant's condo down in the west village.
the dolce & gabbana men's designer who breathed life into the fur-trimmed hoodie?
must be. I heard him on the phone saying he's leaving the dolce and going to the gucci.
what? - Now that's supposed to be a secret, all right?
no one's supposed to know about that.
but let's be honest. Who the hell cares?
Oh, Sammy.
if--if I could get the first published interview with the new creative director at gucci, do you know what that would do for me at work?
well, maybe sammy can hook you up with the guy, and you can ask him all about it.
Yes.
Betty, Sammy promised to "hook me up" with a salon chair two months ago.
you see it here?
well, anything you could do, Sammy.
I--it would-- it would really help.
there are a lot of people lining up for my job.
I don't want to make it any easier for them. Thank you. Bye!
Oh, my god. Wilhelmina is going to freak.
Claire and papa Hartley killed the cotton club shoot.
now baby Hartley's calling an emergency editor's meeting.
morning, guys. - Hate you. Oh, yay.
I'm so glad that I get to catch a rare glimpse of the last living Monchichi waddling into a meeting that I should be in.
you are, like, oozing self-pity today. Something's up.
Oh, my god! Happy birthday!
we are not talking about that. Got it?
one more mention, and heads will roll.
pretty blonde heads that don't have their original nose.
mean.
Ooh, ooh, sorry, Betty. I always sit here. Remember?
okay, um, Matt.
is there another chair?
uh, oh, yeah. I asked for one for you.
um, I guess that's all they had.
a beanbag?
you all right down there?
Yep. I'm fine.
how is Betty the editor of a fashion magazine?
that would be like me being the editor of, like, a mechanic's magazine or you being the editor of a magazine.
pick up your face.
wait. You just totally slammed me.
at least you were considered for the job.
nobody around here even takes me seriously.
damn it. You just made me think about my life.
with the cotton club shoot dead, that means that there is an opening in this issue.
so I'm gonna need-- - Wait, I'm sorry.
did you say an opening in this issue?
uh, yes. That's what I said.
I will be taking pitches all day. So I need good ideas.
but think cheap, okay? The budget is only gonna be about...
uh, Betty. Can you not text right now?
Yeah. No, I'm sorry. It--it's business related.
see, I was shampooing this guy's hair this morning, and he said he might have a story for us.
well, it wasn't, like, a creepy shampoo.
my sister has a hair salon, and it was just busy, so she needed my help. I'm her sister. What am I gonna say, no?
okay, stop. We're uncomfortable.
ay, so come to me whenever you have your pitches. All right? Let's go.
Yeah.
I think I might have a pitch, actually. A pretty good one.
nothing personal, but I can't take "might" to Wilhelmina. Thank you.
no, I know that. I know. But you know what?
the way you said that, that did feel a little personal, and I would just appreciate it--Matt, - don't-- - okay, Betty, don't--please.
look, I am trying to keep my job here just like you are.
and I don't know if you realize this, but your U. N. Fiasco made us both look bad.
so which one of us is making this personal?
they are so in love, it's disgusting. I want that.
take it. I justant her job.
are we obsessed with Betty?
Yes. and it's exhausting.
Oh, I know, and I'm sorry.
but that psychedelic misfit toy is living my dream.
would I let someone take my dream from me?
or would I find a way...
to take it back?
Oh, I never think to destroy someone for me.
at's called low self-eeem.
I can't believe this is still healing.
how hard did you hit him?
it was like his st ble actually fought back.
Oh, no.
I can see you, Daniel.
hate my new desk.
aren't you supposed to be at a support group meeting right now?
Daniel, is that true?
I didn't want to go, all right?
some sad bereavement group is not gonna help me get over Molly's death.
that's not what I need right now.
what, support, guidance?
care... shared experience--which of these is the problem, Daniel?
come on. You're kinda trapping me with your words there.
Daniel, this sort of thing can't keep happening, as much as I would like for you to punch Matt in the face again right now.
there is another meeting this afternoon.
if I find out that you're not there, I'm gonna physically carry you myself. Got it?
Betty, did you know that editors' calls get transferred to assistants during editors' meetings?
Yep. I used to get 'em when I worked for Daniel.
remember how iating it is? Please hold for your pretty sister.
when you're done listening in on Betty's phone call, I need my coffee.
Hilda. Did you get my text?
Yeah, I got it. I called Sammy, and guess what.
the stupid goomba came through.
No! He did?
for you-- a big meeting with a fancy designer today at 4: 00.
for me--nothing.
today! What?! This is amazing.
Hilda, if I can get this story, I can get it in this issue.
what was that?
no. I-I don't know what that was.
you know what you do, right?
you go into Matt's office and you rub this in his spoiled rotten face.
no way, I am keeping this one to myself.
if I want to keep my job, I have to go around Matt.
he's made that very clear.
all right, I will text you the address. I gotta go.
okay. Thank you, thank you, thank you, hilda. I love you!
it's about time. I'm trying to find somebody to cover a busboy shift at the restaurant.
OO let me do it.
what? - Yeah. - No. - Why?
I said busboy. Not bus-you.
papi, wait.
I really need the money to get Justin out of that awful school.
I promise you, I will do such a good job. Ridiculous.
okay. For Justin. - Yeah.
now get over tre early so they can ain you.
please, papi. I think I know how to take dirty plates off of a table.
Mizrahi's tv show, Cindy Crawford's skin care line
have I stepped into a time warp? Is--is this the '90s?
well, actually, you know, thosethings are happening right now.
don't give me these tired pitches to replace my canceled photo shoot.
now I know fashion's not really your thing, but you can at least try to fake it better.
we're done. Get out.
please tell me some good news. I'm not enjoying my day.
you are now. I found Connor.
feel like a trip to Bermuda?
are you' going down there now?
well, what are you gonna do, march up to him and say, "hey, con, remember that money you stole from 'mode'?
hand it over"? - No, Marc. I'm gonna make him an offer.
he can either come back to the U. S.
with my armed bounty hunter and stand trial for his crimes, or he can give me what's left of the money, and I can buy out hartley and the meades and... you know the drill.
they're clearly trying to push me out of this company.
I can see it in their old, droopy eyes.
are you gonna be able to do this?
I mean, you did have feelings for that man.
whatever feelings I had, marc, won't get in the way. I am no amateur.
where is she off to, club a seal?
whatever. She's gone. It gives me time to deal with Suarez.
apparently she's got some huge story that's gonna save her ass at "mode."
she has a meeting with a mysterious "he" at 4: 00.
Ooh. What's the story?
doesn't matter. I'm not gonna let her get it.
and if young Betty doesn't get something in soon, her job is as good as mine.
young Betty? You mean 'cause you're older than her?
okay, why don't you just kick me? Kick me in the special parts.
no more birthday, got it? None.
happy birthday!
Oh, my gosh. H-how'd you know?
I did office birthdays the whole time i was an assistant.
but now that that's your job, I thought I would do one more because I knew you would never get yourself a cake.
you get me. You really get me.
to be honest, I almost forgot just because had a terrible morning.
but now I think it's gonna be a great day, and I hope it's gonna be great for you, too, Marc. Make a wish.
Daniel, swear to me that you're really there.
I swear. How do you want me to prove it to you? What...
excuse me. Will you please tell my friend where I am right now?
please.
a crappy school, support group.
this phone smells like cheese.
see? I'm gonna go to the whole thing.
it's gonna be really good for you, daniel.
I know it's gonna be good for me. Good-bye, Betty.
Oh, no, you don't. Get back here.
Oh, hey. Uh...
you promised that person you'd stay.
you had me vouch for you.
don't rope me in and then make me seem like a liar.
it's rude.
come on.
I had no idea I was gonna be meeting him in his home.
I thought it was gonna be an address for his office or something.
well, the only way I could get him down here was I had to tell him he had to pick a shower tile today or the project was gonna take another two weeks.
and he's a little ticked off, but... so what?
the way you just said that, that sounds like he doesn't know he's gonna meet me.
he doesn't.
okay, calm down.
you are a very impressive young lady.
you just be you, and he's gonna love you.
I have two minutes, Sammy, two.
I've made a million decisions today. I do not want to be doing this right now.
here. Would you take this from me before I throw it against the wall?
that's it? 12 shades of blue?
I cannot be doing this right now.
would you--you-- somebody just decide. Somebody just pick a tile for me.
someone? Anyone?
who the hell are you?
Hi. I'm Betty Suarez.
um, work at "mode" magazine.
mode? - Mode.
I'm a features editor there, and...
I was wondering if you would leme do a story on your transition from dolce & gabbana to gucci.
no, wait. How-- how do you know about that?
are people talking about that? Is it out there? It can't be.
no, no, no, no. No one knows. Just me. Just me.
What--I don't-- what are you even doing here?
don't look at me like that. She's a good kid, all right?
she's a friend from the neighborhood. She's just trying to save her job.
Oh, really? And how are you gonna save your job?
uh, no, no, mr. Grant. Please don't fire sammy.
he was just trying to help me...
in a really weird way.
I'm gonna leave you my card.
and you can call me if you want. I hope you will.
either way, it's fine.
I-I promise I will not tell anyone about yourtory.
I can't even pick a tile.
how am I supposed to decide in three seconds if I should give my story to an 11-year-old editor who broke into my house?
well, I would just put 'em all up.
I like all of the blues together.
Really?
why do I like that?
Oh, becae I just stole your idea.
no, that's what you do when you show your suits and you dress your models in the same color shirt and tie-- the blue on the blue, the gray on the gray, just slightly different shades
which you said in your 2008 fashion week interview was to bring attention to the suit and not...
the tie and the... the shirt.
all right, we'll have dinner tonight, see if we're a good match. If we are, great.
if not, you do not break in to my house again. Got it?
Yeah.
call my office.
an Sammy, put them all up, blue on blue.
you got it.
you couldn't take it either?
either? You're the one who made me go back in there.
and I was right to. Those meetings are very helpful.
But?
but this one sucked so hard. - Thank you.
how about that chick who was wailg about her 100-year-old grandmother that feland broke her hip and got pneumonia and died 2 days later?
I know. 2 days... at 100. It doesn't sound like such a bad way to go.
right? I mean, trying losing somebody your own age.
Yeah.
you, too?
these doughnuts arold as hell.
what do you say I, uh, treat us to me fresh ones?
I feel like I owe you.
what's all this about?
I'm trying to figure out what Betty's big story is so I can kill it.
but I don't know her password.
try "burger. " - I already did, and "cupcake" and "menudo" and "daniel's lady.
what are you doing?
I'm iting you a thank-you note.
well, a thank you and an apology.
ever since you got this promotion,
I have been letting my jealousies get the betterf me.
so... can I start over?
can we... go back to being...
whatever we were before?
well...
to be honest, that is why I got you the cake.
I wanted you to know that despite all of this, we're still...
you know, whatever we were before.
so, uh, hey, how did that big meeting go?
Oh, it, uh... was fine.
scary at first, but, you know, uh, it just turned into dinner at my dad's place.
Nothing--nothing big.
sounds exciting.
where does your dad work again--Frankie's?
you know, I have to get back to doing some research. Do you need anything else?
Nope, that's it. Have fun.
can you believe there's traffic in Bermuda?
well, luckily I've chased felons here befo So I know all the shortcuts.
did you find connor?
we're outside of his hotel waiting for his return.
Claire give you any trouble abt me being gone?
no. But Betty, on the other hand, is a headache that just won't quit.
she's got some big, important dinner tonight that clearly I have to ruin, but I don't want her to know that it was me who ruined it.
so...
now I have to figure out some way of getting Betty to come undone at dinner...
without me being there.
everyone has their Achilles' heel, and no one's is more obvious than Betty's.
Oh, my god.
I think I just found Betty's Achilles' sensible
if you'd like to make a call. - Willie?
I try to be a good friend, but there is a limit.
wait. Don't leave.
what would you say if I told you that I figured out a super fun way for you to prove your worth around here?
I would say it's nighttime. Tell me tomorrow.
that doesn't sound like a woman who wants to be taken seriously.
that sounds like a girl who wants to go out, get drunk, fall in bed with a man who doesn't love her, come back here tomorrow and answer phones for the next 20 years or at least until the hard livin' catches up to her and "mode" wouldn't dare let that grizzled face out from behind a cubicle.
I'm listening. - Wait here.
Matt, I just had the best idea.
for the magazine? - No, no, for you.
remember today when you brought all those pitches to willie and she shamed you in the worst way?
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.
sorry, but come on. Can you blame her?
you really don't know anything about fashion.
and as long as she thinks that you're only here because-- well...
that's not important.
no, no, no, that sounds important.
only thinks I'm here because-- - because you want to be near Betty.
but relax. She only thinks that because everyone else does.
everyone else does?
you haven't exactly been soaking up information, trying to prove that you actually belong here, have you?
no, I gus not. But it's not that easy.
or is it?
it's free dinner at Frankie's-- super-hot restaurant
with an whose father owns half this company
a man who one day may take over himself.
all you have to do is teach him a little bit about fashion, which nobody knows better than you, and he'll totally see that you deserve a brighter future here at "mode.
I don't see the downside.
I hate his shoes.
here, put these on.
Why? Wh
have fun.
...and what I've been doing there. Here you go, Ms. Suarez.
you're usual. And for the gentleman-- vodka rocks, two limes.
thank you. - Sure.
and how about a little starter from the kitchen.
thank you. - One of Ms. Suares favorites, on the house.
Wow. They really treat you well here, huh?
Yes, they do, because they are my family and they are pretending.
this is my sister Hilda and my father Ignacio.
Hi. - How you doing?
right. Well... bon app it.
sorry about that.
they just want this to be special for me. Th're like that.
Oh, yeah. My family is the exact same way.
Oh, really? - God, no. They're horrible people.
would you guys consider adopting?
Oh, uh, uh, for free clothes? Yeah!
my sister and my nephew would love to a
Hey, Betty.
Oh. Oh, good. You turned so white, I thout I would turn around and see a gunman or a kardashian. Who is that?
nobody. They're nobody.
okay, that's my...
my boss/ex-boyfriend, and that's my "friend"/ex-roommate.
oof. And they're on a date?
no. A date?
no, they're--they're so not each other's type.
I-I mean, he's rich, so he's her type, but no.
do you want to go somewhere else?
no. No. Why would we?
Oh, okay. Maybe Betty's not on a date five tables away.
a date? Even if she were, you know, we can stay.
Oh. Okay.
order me... a martini.
I'll be right back. I gotta whiz.
Oh, I am so sorry. Two minutes.
is that Matt with Amanda? What are they doing here?
are they on, like, some kinda date or something?
I--no, I don't know. Why does everybody keepaying "date"?
two people can have dinner. Is called friends.
so what, they're friends now?
Hilda, please. Don't make this a thing, okay?
I can't think about that. I need to focus on my meeting with Evan, which Matt can't even know about, all right? Promise.
of course. Are you...
seriously on a date with Amanda in my father's restaurant with Betty sitting right over there?
I don't think that's any of your business.
just like it's none of my business that Betty is sitting 10 feet away from mewith whoever that guy is.
that sounds like you are on a date.
but you know what? That's cool. Because.
TTY is on a date, too.
Really? - Yeah.
well, good, good. I guess we're even then.
I completely understand, but this is my point
if you release atatement to the press, the excitement lasts, what, a day?
if you let me do a story at "mode,"
then we can feature any of your new designs along with a huge announcement, and then it's a whole event, not just a-a piece of news.
no, that makes sense. Although now I'll have to finish those new designs.
I have designer block. That's what I'm suffering from right now.
I can't decide whether I want a thin knot on my...
I'm so sorry. One--one second, I promise.
don't worry. I told him you are on a date. Too you're welcome.
Hilda, you prom--wait, what?
he said he was on a date? - Yes.
no. - Yeah.
why would he can't...
no.
Hilda, what are you doing to her? You should be picking up plates.
papi, I gotta tell her what kind of guy Matt really is.
- Please. Listen.
you know what you gotta do?
you gotta go out there and rub your date in his face just like he is rubbing his in yours.
no. No, I can't-- I can't--I can't do that.
Evan's not even my date.
th-- I can't deal with this right now.
I-I won't. I can't.
I have to focus on the meeting. This isn't happening.
this is not happening.
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. Here, let me help.
I'm sorry. - No, no, no, I got it. I got it.
please just-- - no, no, no, it's okay. Ah, that's hot. Sorry.
can you just go back to your seat please?
you okay? - Here you are, sir.
I just--I can't stand the feeling...
that I don't know what to do.
what comes next? What's gonna help?
you just gotta try and find something that works for you.
I try everything.
as far as mourners go, I think I fall on the needy side.
is anything working?
actually, there's this thing I heard that really stuck with me.
it's this idea that when you lose someone, you should do one thing every day that makes you feel totally alE.
you know, because it feels like there's so much death?
I don't exactly know what wouldake me feel like that right now.
it's--it's been a while.
I hear ya.
unfortunately for me, a lot of the things that used to make me liel ave are illegal.
wait. What's that smile?
when I was a kid, we used to spend the summers in the Hamptons.
my brother and i would stay up...
and then we'd sneak in to the neighbors' yards and swim in their pools, which was kinda weird, because we had a pool.
but it didn't matter,'cause every time we did it, I always thought...
we are, for sure, the coolest kids ever.
you know... I didn't do my feel alive thing for today.
so is--is that, um-- - hey. Sorry to bother.
but I gotta get a picture of my little sister's first big meeting.
no. - Get over there.
squeeze together. Squish together. ...
let's do something soft and pretty.
okay. Close together. Squish, squish.
is this okay? - Yep.
really see--yeah, get cozy like you're friends-- - hilda.
take the picture.
good. That was great. Thanks. Saving it.
so do you want to talk about classic designers, current trends or the next big thing that only i and a few japanese schoolgirls know about?
all of it, but, you know, first, you-- you gotta try this salad. It's amazing.
Oh, no food. Just liquor.
I save all my caloric intake for dessert.
I got an eyelash in my... - oh, let me get--here.
it hurts. Get it out. Get it out. Get it out. Geit out. - No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got it.
did you get it? Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it. It hurtso much. - Got it.
you know wha why don't i come back over there and show you some stuff that I've had published at "mode" and--and online?
Justide by side, uh, if that's okay.
it makes it easier to...
just, it's easier to...
Oh, this here is a...
Oh, there it is. - Like, if you want a tailor, you can go to the random woman...
marc - - this trip is a total disaster.
Connor checked out this morning.
and I suspect he was tipped off by our bargain bounty hunter.
we need a new bounty hunter.
next time, I prer one in brown.
Hello, Willie.
give that back to me.
I just want to catch up a bit before you call the goon and start the blackmailing.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
don't pretend with me.
I know every me you've made since I left.
you know, I may be a crook, but my feelings for you were real.
and I thought you felt the same way about me.
any feelings I had for you died the day you stole from me.
how could you, Connor? I put my life into that magazine--everything I had.
and you took it. You walked off and you left me with nothing.
I didn't really take from you. I took for you.
and I'd it all again.
come away with me.
you are insane. - Yeah, but I'm happy. Are you?
Wilhelmina, you have always lived your life a certain way.
but when you're ready to pursue another option with me...
just put it out there. I'll find you again.
but not until then.
Ah, and one more thing...
did we make it? I think wee it.
I don't think anybody saw us.
actually, we're not done yet.
go get the lights.
Natalie, just, um... so we're clear.
I'm not really, uh, ready for.
for what? Sex?
my boyfriend O. D. Ed two months ago.
and I didn't have time to shower today, so you're safe.
it's fine.
my god, it'sold.
I can't believe we did this. - Oh, I know.
okay, bye. That was Marc.
I told him we're fine, but Betty is a sloppy drunk and she's being all handsy with some dude.
he totally loves me right now.
that was when I sprouted wings and flew directly into the sun.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did that. - Well, I do.
you want to see what's going on over there?
go see what's going on back there.
no, I don't. - This meeting is over. Good night.
no. No, I'm--no, please. I-I-I promise, I...
I don't know and I don't care what is going on between the two of you, but what you did tonight was unforgivable.
what did we do?
Oh, that is so you, Amanda-- - just playing innocent while you throw yourself at the nearest billionaire.
Oh, back that projector up.
Yeah, Betty, I don't think that we were the ones drawing attention to ourselves tonight.
Oh, please, Matt. You were all over her.
what, me? Me? What about you and that guy?
Whoa! Okay. Stop.
I just realized what's been going on her you know, it is one thing to flirt with me.
you're a man, I'm me, it happens.
but to do it just to get back at Betty?
nobody uses this to make that jealous.
I guess I stupid to think that you actually wanted to hear what I had to say.
No,Amanda. I...
you know, just because your date was bad doesn't mean... - it wasn't a date, Matt.
you have to come over here... - Actually, it was really important...
okay, all right. Into the kitchen. Here we go.
that was a meeting.
a very important meeting with a very important man who had a great story for our magazine, who you might have recognized if you worked at "mode" for any other reason but to torture me.
do you know how hard I have worked for this promotion, how long I have waited?
and you are ruining it.
you are ruining something that means so much to me.
I know! I know I am, and I can't help it.
what? - You're right, I am awful to you, but...
I can't stop myself because I can't stand seeing you happy when I am in so much pain.
and you--you probably can't understand that because you are so...good.
you're not some spoiled rich kid who can't handle it when he doesn't get his way, but apparently...
that's who I am.
and the worse thing is that, with every word I say,
I know I am ruining whatever hope we had of fixing this relationship.
I don't know what just happened.
he told you who he is.
it's from the, uh, bodega.
I remembered you were waiting for dessert, but you, uh, left before you got it, so...
is that it?
look, I've been kind of a-a monster lately, and unfortunately, you were one of the people I hurt.
I mean, you were nice enough to share your considerable wisdom with me, which I desperately need, and I disrespected you.
my considerable wisdom, huh?
what--what, too arch? - No.
whatever. I wish I knew half of what you kno what I'm trying to s is... I'm sorry.
you're a smart, interesting woman and you should be treated like one.
so I'll-- I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey, Matt. - Yeah.
you know what really makes me angry?
I didn't even get to say good-bye to her.
well, who says you have to say good-bye?
I mean, why do we have to give up on relationships with people we've lost?
why can't we still have them, but in a different way?
why don't you talk to her?
talk to molly right now under the stars.
no. come on. I'm not that guy. I don't... I don't do that.
don't be such a dude. Come on.
no. I... I can't do that.
Oh, my god. Was he always this much of a wuss when you knew him?
okay. All right.
Hi, Molly.
I'm sorry I didn't get to say good-bye.
I think I need to stop being so angry now.
I guess I was just afraid...
if I wasn't angry enough, you'd think...
you know, I didn't care.
I really need you know that I...
I did care...
so much.
I still do.
I bet she gets that.
Yeah.
feels like she does.
no. Amanda! Please don't close the door.
a lot of traffic in here tonight.
Amanda, I'm sorry.
what I said was... mean and unfair.
well, thank you, and just so you know,
I only went out with him because Marc said Matt was insecure about work, and it would be a really good opportunity for me to step up.
wait. Wait, Marc set you up?
did he tell you to go to my father's restaurant?
Yeah, he made the reservation.
Oh, my god. That bitch.
Yes, what you just said.
tonight after you left, Matt sort of broke down and...
said all this stuff about being a bad guy and... I don't know.
for the first time in a long time, I saw...
the good guy underneath, the guy I fell for, the one who still cares about me and... and now I'm stuck.
and I don't know what to do.
am I right about him...
or should I just move on?
honestly, Betty, I think it's time you moved on.
so, associate features editor Suarez, how'd the big dinner go?
bad. Actually, really bad.
and to make things worse, I just found out "elle" scored a great story that I worked very hard to get.
but please don't pretend to feel sorry for me, Marc. I know exactly what you did.
and you know what? We both deserved this job, but I got it, so deal with it and act your age...
your new age.
Oh, hey, Mandy.
you don't use me for your little schemes, okay?
we use people together.
I'll text you when I'm over it.
Hey. Welcome back.
you okay... about not finding Coor?
well... what could I do?
you win some, you lose some.
weirdly, I won mine.
I remember when I interviewed to be your assistant.
so that's the group H. R. sent me?
kind of a motley looking group.
I only talked to them for a little while, but I really like Gavin.
which one's he?
I don't want to do this interview today.
I'm starting to feel queasy.
maybe because you're eating chocolate-covered pretzels for breakfast.
Thanks.
I would've eaten the whole bag.
see?
which one of those goobers is gonna do that for me?
not too long ago, I was one of those goobers.
all right.
promise me you're gonna pick someone good.
I promise. - Good.
now do you need anything else?
actually...
fact-checking?
I know you're swamped.
come on. What kind of editor would I be if I couldn't do a little fact-checking?
add it to my pile.
all of it by 2: 00?
no problem.
that's a lot of red ink, but I'm happy to redo it.
japanese to English?
I look forward to the challenge.
look at that giant.
I know! And it's carrying all those papers.
ignoring and rising above.
what's wrong, Betty?
now that you're a big fancy editor, you don't even talk to the little people?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I couldn't hear you over your loud shirt.
did you just... - fashion-smack by Suarez...unexpected.
unlike you, Betty, I look great in jewel tones.
what's with the attitude?
I've tried being nice to you, but since my promotion, all you do is insult me and sabotage me, so I'm done with you.
I really like this side of her.
do you mind?
sorry.
no, no, no.
it's my bad. But here- here, let me help.
I was wondering if you had any, uh... feature idea for the New York issue?
what, you mean, like, to write an article?
unless you're too busy with.
Oh, no! No, I- I would love to write an article.
actually, I've been working on this concept about the unsung heroes of New York.
people who do the toughest jobs, and we could show case their uniforms for a fashion angle.
"new York's ten most thankless jobs." Sounds perfect.
Really?
Thanks. Okay, great.
well... I'll... I'll get to work.
Oh, and, Matt?
I'm really glad that we... you know.
Yeah, me, too.
Oh, hey, Matt.
I really like your haircut.
it just looks so healthy.
it makes me want to pull it.
actually, I didn't get a haircut!
that kind of hurts.
thank you.
Bye.
Oh, my God, Mandy.
you were, like, five seconds away from flipping his omelet right here on the desk.
you love him.
please.
he's tainted.
kissing him would be like kissing Betty.
Betty. - Yes?
Daniel's been looking for you.
he wants you to meet the new assistant.
he picked someone? Is it Gavin?
I don't think so.
Hi.
are you Daniel's new assistant?
Lexie, like,"sexy." - Oh, I see.
well, I'm Betty... like... confetti!
I'm Daniel's old assistant, so I'm more than happy to help you.
I can- I can show you how things work.
I know how things work.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Hey, Betty.
did you meet Lexie yet?
Lexie, like,'sexy'?
Yes, we met.
Daniel. - What?
what happened to Gavin?
of all the people H. R. sent over...
that's who you picked?
looks had nothing to do with it.
I- I can't believe you would even think that.
I'm a widower, Betty.
you certainly didn't pick her because she's friendly.
well, maybe she's just intimidated by you.
I mean, I told her she had some pretty big shoes to fill.
and... she nailed the interview- totally helpful.
let me get that for you.
I mean, just because she's pretty doesn't mean she's not qualified.
you should know, judging a book by its cover works both ways.
I'm sure if you think she's capable, then she'll be great.
where the hell have you been?
can't I go out to get some frozen yogurt?
if you can go a couple weeks without murdering any boyfriends.
did you talk to anyone?
you know me- just get one frozen yogurt in me, and I just tell all my secrets.
is this a joke to you?
you will not be laughing when we're both in jail, young lady.
mom!
it was 20 minutes.
I asked you to do one thing- stay put.
Nico, after everything I've done for you,
boarding school in France, taking you in when you needed help.
I'm sorry.
it won't happen again.
you're right. It won't happen again.
because from now on, you don't leave my side.
that's it. Now you just type in your password right there.
and that's how you check your e-mail.
so...what's my password again?
ignacio rules.
just wanted to hear you say that.
Hey, look at that!
guess papi's more modern than you thought.
Yes, congratulations.
you have mastered e-mail.
welcome to 1993.
I think it's very cool that you're learning to use the computer.
you are in a mood.
what? - It's Archie.
I never get to see him anymore.
he's too busy campaigning and canvassing the neighborhood.
I'll tell you one neighborhood isn't canvassing, if you know what I mean.
what?
it's passion.
without it, relationships fizzle, and I don't want that to happen to us.
maybe he's... not attracted to me anymore.
what, are you crazy?
look at you.
Yeah, that would be pretty crazy.
mija, more coffee?
you're gonna be up all night.
it's the only way I'm gonna make it through.
I have all this work to do, and I haven't even started writing my article.
just have the people below you do it.
isn't that what editors do?
Justin, I'm a junior editor.
there's no one lower than me in my department.
there is always someone lower than you.
in junior high, the drama kids seemed like the bottom of the food chain, but we weren't.
there was always the band and the Renaissance Fair nerds.
I did Renaissance Fair!
I was one of the queen's dancers.
so, Betty, who's below you?
there is a pool of assistants that junior editors can use, but I don't want it to look like I can't handle my own work.
mija, it is not a sign of weakness to ask for help.
Margaret, I know you hate your life, but does everything you pick out have to be so dreary?
don't come back until you get it right.
great pep talk.
everyone looked real scared.
Hey, Willie, can I talk to you about something?
I just ran into tall Paul from styles, who was talking to fat Pat from accounting, - who heard on good authority from gay Renee... - Oh, just say it!
Hartley and Claire were having dinner with Isabelle Besset last night.
word is, she's replacing you.
what are we gonna do?
what's the plan, blackmail?
I've been trying to get dirt on Isabelle for years.
she's clean as a whistle.
then what?
Hartley and Claire think you're the enemy!
we will just have to convince them that I'm not the enemy.
remind them I'm a team player.
you're serious?
Yes!
I can turn on the charm if I want.
while I'm on shaky ground, it wouldn't kill me to kiss Claire's bony ass.
so... your plan is... being nice?
Yes.
I'm just gonna give you some space...
and some time, so you can hatch up something else.
eaking of things you've hatched, Nico is here.
Yes. I brought her into learn about fashion.
go grab her a chair.
she'll be quiet as a mouse.
okay. Sure.
so, Nico, what you been doing since boarding school?
what brings you back?
I'm sorry to interrupt.
don't be sorry. Being sorry takes time. Just spit it out.
well, I've requested assistant from the pool, but H. R. says you have to sign off on it.
but you never stay with your mom for this long.
is it boy trouble?
didn't you meet some guy backpacking through Europe?
what ever happened to him?
you need an assistant?
done.
walk this way.
Really?
wow, thank you.
I have so much editorial work.
I had no idea that...
Oh, I thought we were... walking.
we're here.
Marc, I need to reassign you for a few days.
reassign me?
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I didn't... - Yes.
Betty here needs an assistant, and you are .
I cannot be Betty's assistant!
it goes against the natural order of things.
I've made my decision, Marc.
is this because I told you about a certain French editor who might be replacing you?
do not punish the messenger, Willie!
it's a good learning experience for Nico to man the desk.
besides, you're always complaining that you want more editorial responsibility, and Betty needs help with a feature.
um... you know what?
I- I can do this by myself.
Betty, you might've been a star assistant, but as an editor, you have failed to produce one single item for this magazine.
you want help?
here it is.
I don't want to hear another word about it.
Betty's in charge, so shut up and get out!
I said get out!
very mature.
just because I'm your temporary assistant does not mean I'm getting you coffee.
got it? I could've been an editor at "v"!
a certain magazine whose shall not be said...
rhymes with rogue Dante Nelli Jr.
himself, offered me a job- Dante Nelli Jr.
a man so fabulous, he wears a caftan every day of the year.
and I said, no, thanks, Dante.
I'd rather be at 'Mode,' doing grunt work for Betty Suarez.
you know what, Marc?!
this is awkward for me, too, but I could actually use your help.
I need to trim a hundred words from the trends column.
maybe you could help me with that.
I could do that in my sleep!
Hey, Lexie.
I'm gonna pop down to the cafeteria have lunch with my friend Natalie.
I'm on the phone.
what was it you were saying?
okay.
uh, anyway, I'll be back in an hour or so, okay?
sorry. My new boss- yabbering on about something.
mother, would you please take off your sunglasses?
it's embarrassing.
I can't believe you dragged me down here.
what kind of sad people eat in cafeterias?
Hello, hello!
well, well.
scooch over there a second, would you, please?
thank you.
what a nice surprise.
this is my daughter Nico.
Hello, Nico.
it's nice to meet you, dear.
surprised to see you down here, Wilhelmina.
what, are you eating amongst the commoners?
you're too funny.
I would bust a rib if I hadn't had them all removed.
uh, could we talk business for just a minute?
we like the New York issue, but we are a little concerned about sales.
now Cal has an idea, so try to keep an open mind about this.
get on with it, you old bag.
well, uh, every book or movie I see these days is about vampires.
it's just- it's a total cash cow.
now what if we put a vampire on the cover of "Mode..."
you've got to be kidding me.
so the New York theme becomes Gothic Gotham.
keep the fashion, but give our cover girl some fangs.
worst idea ever.
Oh, wait. It's my turn to talk.
I love it!
you do?
Oh, Cal and I thought we might get some push back from you on this.
I know a great idea when I hear one.
Wilhelmina Slater is and will always be a team player.
I am crazy for tater tots.
you want one?
uh, I don't know if that can be called grief eating.
you're in way too good of a mood.
you know what?
I am.
I've been going to hear this guy give these inspirational talks, and...
yeah? - Don't know.
he's kinda great.
he teaches you how to cope with all sorts of stuff- addiction, divorce.
if you're curious, there's actually a talk this afternoon about losing loved ones.
Oh, wow.
the community of the phoenix.
rise up from the ashes of your life and soar.
you think it's cheesy, new age-y?
I know.
forget the brochure.
so really been helping me work through some stuff.
okay, you just scoffed at me.
I'm- I'm not scoffing.
okay, at ever.
you know what? Never mind you're probably not ready for it anyway.
Oh, and what makes you think I'm not ready?
of course I'm ready.
besides, what can it hurt, right?
right.
Hi, Hilda.
do you remember that Halloween when I was the sexy superhero?
remember all of those guys were groping me?
that was the year I went as D. N.A.
Oh, yeah.
that was sad.
anyway, where are those sassy boots?
Why?
I am gonna text Archiea sexy picture of myself, you know, put a little air in his tires.
Hilda... sexting?
what? Please.
it's not like I'm gonna be nude.
it's gonna be tasteful- pg-13.
I'm not giving away the whole fruit basket, Betty, just the nectarines.
classy.
the boots are in the attic. I gotta go.
Bye. - Bye.
while you were on your personal call, I finished the trends column.
you cut the whole intro?
you know what? I don't miss it.
good idea.
great idea.
what?
nothing.
it's just- it's bad enough I have to watch you get promoted above me without having any knowledge of fashion, but now I have to have your ineptitude rubbed in my face.
you know what, Marc? I'm not gonna keep having this argument with you.
I know I'm not perfect, but Daniel and Wilhelmina picked me for a reason.
Yeah, Daniel's name is on the building, and you two are lovers.
you know, I have half a mind to march into Daniel's office right now and put this issue to rest once and for all.
I would love to see the look on your face when Daniel says they gave me the job because they thought I would be a better editor than you.
okay. I would love to hear him say those words.
fine. - Fine.
fine.
no, - You're both so qualified. It was... - Just give us the truth.
your vote trumped Wilhelmina's, right?
because you're a Meade.
or was it simply that I had more potential as an editor?
it was a very, uh, hard decision for us to make.
why are you sparing their feelings, Daniel?
we tossed a coin.
and you got your job, Betty, because you were tails.
now you know I wanted you in this job.
but the coin toss was the only way to break the impasse.
I know.
it's just- the only thing keeping me going was the feeling that I actually deserve this.
Betty, wait, wait, wait.
you do deserve this.
believe me.
Yeah, I know.
good.
look, I have to run to my layout meeting.
are you sure you're gonna be all right?
Yeah.
Yes.
okay.
Hey, tails.
I'm so happy that we cleared that up.
you're not better than me.
you're just lucky.
you're nothing more than tails, the buttocks of a quarter.
Oh, hey, guys.
Betty, how's your article going?
great.
I've already set up a bunch of interviews with some of the toughest working people in the city, and I'm going down there to see first-hand.
great, and while you're down there, why don't you see if they'll let you actually do some of the jobs?
Oh, okay.
like a first-person piece?
Yeah, and you should wear all the humiliating clothes that they wear, take lots of pictures of it to document the whole thing.
that's a great idea, Marc.
see, some people just know how to think like editor.
can you get my messages for me, plea?
thank you.
Hello, Mr. Candidate.
did you take the picture that I sent you?
Yes, I got it, and so did everyone else.
what?
you hit "reply all" to one of my campaign e-mails, Hilda.
that picture went to my entire "distro" list.
Oh, my God!
Hello!
Hilda, this is the absolute worst thing that could happen at this point in my campaign.
this is terrible. - Checking my e-mail!
Archie. Archie, you gotta get that e-mail back.
I'm not decent.
I can't get it back.
and now everyone, including the kids I volunteer with, are opening up their e-mails and finding a picture of your boobs!
I can't talk right now, okay?
just meet me later, okay?
okay.
Hey!
I got something from you.
it's a picture.
where are my reading glasses?
No!
Hey, Lexie.
how about a cup coffee?
Oh, yeah, I'd love one. Thanks.
Oh, uh, ok.
finished your fact-checking.
Thanks.
so, uh, you're getting her coffee now?
Yeah, you know what?
I don't think it's working out so well with Lexie.
which is weird, because I'm usually such a good judge of character.
Yeah.
I picked you, didn't I?
uh, no, not exactly.
your father picked me, precisely so that you wouldn't do what you always do, which is hire an assistant that you want to sleep with.
Really?
is that why you hired me?
Hey, Lexie.
you're disgusting.
no, no.
Oh, my God. I didn't know she was right there.
do you want me to go say something to her?
no, you're busy.
my problem.
I can handle it.
Lexie, I really need to apologize to you.
you heard something out of context, and I really want you to know, that's not the reason I hired you.
I mean, I promise you, the more you get to know me, the more you'll realize I'm not just like that, okay?
what is wrong with you? - No, no.
you think you can just grab me?
it was an accident. I was trying to reach for your shoulder.
you dirty old man.
no, no. I'm- I'm- Lexie, I'm sorry.
old?
tails!
will you stop doing that?
come on. It's time for you to do the ten worst jobs in New York city.
Mr. Badlani?
Hi. I'm Betty Suarez.
we spoke on the phone.
I'm here to be your hot dog hostess.
Taj Ma hot dog. Delicious meat substitute hot dogs.
sounds tasty.
thank you.
now I know it's chilly today, but, it can get mighty sticky inside that hot dog suit.
I'm sorry.
there's an actual hot dog suit?
Oh, just when I thought this day couldn't get sweeter.
now which one of you is going to be the wiener, and which one is going to be the bun?
what? - It's a 2-man costume.
you can't have the wiener without the bun.
you heard the man. - No.
you wear the stupid costumes.
it's your article.
you're the editor.
you're right, Marc.
I am the editor.
and while I've been doing the hardest jobs in New York all day long, you have been doing nothing at all.
but you heard Wilhelmina. I'm in charge.
so suit up, because I'm the boss, and you're the bun.
well, what do you think?
you look great.
but, please, don't eat in front of the customers.
a hot dog eating a hot dog?
it freaks them out.
okay, well, what do I do?
greet customers?
hand out some coupons?
that doesn't seem so hard.
sometimes that happens.
now where is my bun?
bun!
we need you!
can't have a hot dog without a bun.
there you are!
unlike you, Betty, who wears ridiculous getups on a daily basis,
I have a reputation to protect.
come on, Marc.
you look adorable- good enough to.
what the hell is that?
Oh, it's the hot dog music.
come on. I'll show you the dance steps.
it still doesn't read "vampire" to me.
maybe... sharper fangs, and...
maybe we should add some blood to the front of the dress.
Oh, I agree.
good idea, Claire.
don't you dare.
what are you doing?
it wasn't on purpose.
don't you have enough blood on your hands?
mom, do not get all pissy with me just because you hate this vampire idea.
God, it's not my fault.
actually, it is.
I'm hanging on by a thread, doing everything I can to keep my job.
because without my job, I can't help you.
it's all for you.
so I'm making nice, even though this vampire shoot is ridiculous.
ridiculous?
what happened to loving the concept?
I do.
I am 100% on board.
team player!
we ran this idea by you because we wanted your blunt opinion.
well, how the hell am I supposed to give you my honest opinion, knowing that Isabelle Besset can replace me any minute?
I had a feeling you might have heard about that.
you want to know the truth?
Yes.
this is juvenile.
you put this on the cover, and it damages the brand.
"mode" does not follow trends.
we set them.
all right.
I'll talk to Cal.
you're agreeing with me?
Yes.
and now you do something for me.
trim the budget.
start by cutting ten pages of content.
Oh, and, Wilhelmina, just do your job... while you still have it.
okay, 5,6, 7,8.
eat me, I'm a hot dog and I'm a whole wheat bun, now it's time to eat the greatest treat under the sun.
as much as I love giant wieners flying at me, this is a little outside my comfort zone.
you didn't even try to catch me, Marc.
it's not my fault you can't count.
you were two full measures early.
Oh, now I can't count?
no, you can't count and you can't dance and you certainly can't edit a fashion magazine.
what is it with you, Marc?
you know, if the coin toss would have gone the other way, if you would have been promoted, I would have just been happy for you.
why can't you just be happy for me?
why should I be happy for you?
Yeah, of course the coin landed on you.
you're, the luckiest person in the world.
you have a great job, great family, multiple attractive men have wanted to date you.
God knows why.
I can't catch a break.
I am always the bun.
come on, Marc.
it's not that bad. - Don't "happy Betty" me.
you want to talk thankless jobs in New York city?
try being Wilhelmina Slater's gofer for five years.
and the worst part of it is,
I could have been editor at the magazine whose name shall not be mentioned.
I could have been prot,
to the most fashionable man in publishing- my style icon, Dante Nelli Jr.
yes?
you grabbed her boob? - No, I didn't grab it.
I just- I sort of- I grazed it.
it was an accident.
I was going to apologize.
I don't care how bad an assistant she is.
if you grabbed, grazed or looked sideways at that boob, you cannot fire her.
you'll be a big lawsuit on your hands.
I am so, so sorry.
I feel terrible about this.
the last thing I wanted to do was hurt you.
I just...I didn't think... - That's right, Hilda.
you didn't think.
I know you didn't mean for this to happen, but do you know what photos like this do to campaigns?
this is a big embarrassment for me!
nobody could be as embarrassed about this as me.
it's my picture people are talking about.
well, then why did you do it?
you've been so busy lately.
I just wanted us to be...closer, you know?
I wanted you to be excited about us again.
I'm sorry if I'm an embarrassment to you.
Ah, I'm surprised you remembered me.
of course I do.
it's not often that someone refuses a job from us, but you said you had to pursue your dream, which apparently is selling hot dogs?
Oh, no, I don't- I don't work here.
I- I'm still at "Mode."
they finally made you editor?
still picking up Wilhelmina's dry cleaning.
actually, Marc was so valuable at "Mode" that we just added him to the features department.
we're doing a story right now on the hardest jobs in New York.
that's why we're in these crazy costumes.
features?
well, good for you.
Congratulations.
you know, I like to stay current with up-and-coming young editors.
brunch sometime?
have your assistant set it up.
actually, she's not... - I would be happy to.
you didn't have to do that.
I know.
Thanks.
I just figured you were due for a change in luck.
it's you.
emergency editors' meeting at 4: 00 P. M.
that's in seven minutes.
well, we have to get back to the office.
I'll get the cab.
you go back to Mr. Badlani, tell him and get our clothes.
hold the door! Thank you.
come on. Hurry! Where's my clothes?
I might have accidentally trashed them.
what? - In my defense, I was sort of hating you at the time.
here. Let me just... - Don't help me.
Oh, Betty, don't be like that.
you know, every single time I think there's a glimmer of a decent person in there, you always seem to prove me wrong.
and now I get to go back to the office dressed like a hot dog, where everybody already thinks I'm a joke.
thank you.
close the door, please.
why do we have to accept that our loved ones are gone?
they're with us always.
and if we deny that, it'll only prolong our pain.
so I say reject acceptance.
you don't agree with me?
you don't want to be here, do you?
no, he doesn't. - Yes, I do.
I'm offering you a chance at an elevated relationship with someone you lost.
but you can only achieve that connection when you're honest with yourself about what you want.
and you can't even be honest with me.
or can you?
did you want to be here?
fine. I don't want to be here.
Congratulations.
you just healed a part of yourself.
you're scoffing at that?
I wasn't scoffing.
he was. He was scoffing.
he's been doing it all day.
stop it. - What?
I'm trying to help you.
fine.
Yes, I was scoffing.
but come on.
honesty heals?
don't you think that sounds a little simplistic?
well... people have always underestimated the power of simplicity.
I tell you what.
go and try being honest in your daily...
exactly when you think you shouldn't be.
and if I'm right, and it frees you up in some way, come back.
and if it doesn't, fine.
accept that the person you love is gone forever, and good luck with that.
can we talk?
I need to, uh, tell you something, and it's kind of a secret.
what is it?
come here.
no. Closer.
closer.
you're such a good kisser.
it's just a hot dog suit.
look, do you know if the editors' meeting started yet?
h- have you seen, uh, have you seen Betty?
listen, Wilhelmina is cutting ten pages of content for budget.
everyone is fighting to keep their stuff in.
I look ridiculous.
do I have time to change?
if you want to save your article, we better get in there quick.
Lexie, can you get the book from the art department, please?
get it yourself.
you know how to grab things.
wait, Lexie. Lexie, hey.
let me be totally honest with you.
the only reason I hired you is because you're hot.
in fact, you're crazy hot, and I'm a man who likes to look at a beautiful woman, so sue me.
no, he's just kidding.
no. No. Don't- don't sue him.
Daniel, what are you doing?
I'm telling the truth.
you're not right for this job, Lexie.
you're mean, you're impatient, you walk around as everyone's below you, and they are, because you're 20 feet tall.
you're not an assistant, Lexie.
I think you would make a terrific model.
a model?
think about it.
you shouldn't be behind a desk.
you should be sprawled across a desk, dressed in skin-tight couture, looking hungry on the cover of a magazine.
Oh, God.
you know, I always thought I was too pretty to be a secretary, but girls always hated me when I said it out loud.
okay, well, say it then.
say,"I am a model."
I... am... a model.
thank you.
Oh, I have to go tell everyone that I know now.
what the hell was that?
honesty.
I'm sorry, Jill.
you can't convince me that leggings are pants.
your article's out.
who's next?
whatever that is, it's cut.
wait. Doesn't Betty get chance to defend her article?
everybody else did.
all right. You have 30 seconds. Go.
um, okay, my article is about the toughest jobs in New York.
it seems a little dry.
maybe it could use some mustard?
I'm sorry, Betty.
I don't see it fitting in "Mode."
maybe you had to be there.
wait, Willie.
but you could be... if we recreated it for you.
what are you doing?
I'm saving you.
come on.
dance.
eat me, I'm a hot dog and I'm a whole wheat bun, now it's time to eat the greatest treat under the sun, add a squirt of ketchup for a whole lot more fun, eat me, I'm a hot dog eat me, I'm a bun eat us, that was the most humiliating thing I've ever seen.
Yes, these uniforms are ridiculous, but this whole city is full of uniforms.
and inspiration for fashion comes from the most unlikely places, like bike messengers in bright lycra or...
or the epaulets on a policeman's uniform.
trash collectors were wearing jumpsuits way before they showed upon every runway last spring.
also look at these funny pictures of Betty wearing the uniforms.
I can't run those pictures.
then instead of Betty, picture a supermodel.
congratulations, Betty.
you're in.
Oh, here's Lexie pulling the pedicab.
the camera loves Lexie, like sexy.
I have no idea what I was thinking hiring her as my assistant.
I mean, come on. That was something old Daniel would do.
come on. You made a mistake. You're only human.
so why is it you'll cut me some slack but you won't do the same for yourself?
what do you mean?
I mean, this is your first piece for the magazine as editor.
it's a great spread.
you're not even the least bit excited.
I'm excited.
But?
it's just- I've been fighting and fighting with Marc, trying to prove to him that I deserve to be the editor.
and then he's the one who saved the day.
Betty, this whole piece was your idea.
why don't you know you're good at this?
you're great at this.
I don't know. Maybe because I was tails.
look, Betty, some people get the job because of the flip of a coin.
some people get the job because... their father owns the company.
it doesn't matter how you get it.
it matters what you do with it.
can I borrow you?
this will only take a minute.
I'll be right back.
and now to candidate Archie Rodriguez.
now a lot of hubbub has been made over a certain photo of my girlfriend, and I just wish the press would stop showing this photo.
that's not my best angle. - Just watch.
everyone's been asking me if I want to apologize to the voters, but the truth is,
the only person who deserves an apology is my girlfriend.
she had her privacy invaded, and I'm sorry I wasn't more understanding.
as for the voters, they're just gonna have to accept the fact that my girlfriend... is sexy.
I will not apologize for that.
I can't believe you did that.
Yeah. And we got the latest polls, and thanks to your sexy picture, Hilda, I'm more popular than ever.
I'm in the lead. - Oh, my God!
Oh, God! That's fantastic!
Oh, my God, Archie, you're gonna win.
wait. Now?
I got customers.
they can wait.
Mrs. Ramirez!
I'll be back in 11 minutes!
I brought us a treat.
frozen yogurt!
chocolate!
my favorite!
mine, too.
frozen yogurt in the middle of the day?
what's the occasion?
mama is keeping her job.
Isabelle Besset turned it down, and for the li of me, I don't know why.
you would think that "Mode" would be a step up from French "Elle."
well, I heard she got a call from an editor at French "Mode,"
something about how difficult Claire and Hartley are to work for.
I don't remember bring anyone from "Mode" France.
Bonjour.
Pourrais je parler avec Isabelle Besset, s'il vous pla?
you?
you devious little minx.
I guess all those years at French boarding school paid off.
mom, I'm just so sorry about dragging into all this, and I figured, after all you've done for me, I owed you.
Oh, Nico.
my darling daughter, I would do anything for you.
and I have a feeling everything is gonna be all right.
I was at your father's funeral.
I bet you're just like him.
no...
I'm not.
partial retrograde amnesia?
she doesn't even remember becoming a woman.
I wanted you to know that I talked to Charlie, and she admitted everything.
who's the father? - We're gonna do a paternity test.
I am freakin' fey sommers' daughter.
you are not an orphan.
I need to find my father - I'm gonna enroll in a writing class. - Great.
I'm gonna be a writer.
anybody here? - Dad?
we missed you.
her lips were cold.
I could never tell her that I'd loved her all along.
she left for Dusseldorf that morning...
with my heart in her backpack.
applause? Really?
why don't you tell the class what you like so much about this piece?
well, um, it was sweet, and I really felt his pain.
here's what I felt.
this class is called "finding your voice."
it's for serious writers, not emotionally stunted dilettantes!
I expect you people to dig deeper!
open those old wounds!
and if there are no old wounds, well, I always say, "if you have nothing to write, try killing yourself."
if you fail, you'll have something to write about.
if you succeed, your troubles will be over.
next week, a thousand words on your most defining moment.
and you, clappy.
I'll be very interested in what you have to say.
he called you "clappy"? - Yes.
he's mean. Like Simon Cowell, but with a Pulitzer, and I can't just be Jordin Sparks good, I have to be Kelly Clarkson, "Miss Independent" good.
I don't know any of those people, but I read your story, and it was an A-plus.
dad, you like everything I do.
when I was 10, you told me I could be a model.
you could be a model.
a guy in a car once told me I could be a model.
I know, Hilda. I stopped you from getting in that car.
Oh, yeah.
this class is phase one of my career.
I write, I get published, I work my way to editor, and then I can run a magazine.
and then you really will need a model.
see, I should get in that car.
it's not a joke, Hilda.
if I can't even get through this class, then my whole career is out the window.
sweetheart, you had straight A's in high school.
you graduated top of your class at Queens College.
Yeah, but that's not the real world, which is why I sent my story to Daniel.
he does this for a living.
he'll know if it's good...
or if I'm gonna get voted off.
Hey, kiddo.
that, uh, jacket's kind a big.
it was Dad's.
it's badass.
so, Justin, how was your math test?
kind a flunked it.
whatever, it's only the first test of the year.
it doesn't matter.
actually, no, they all matter equally.
they average them. - Oh, come on.
when was the last time you ever used algebra?
why do you defend him?
he's never gotten an "F" before, not even in gym,
which he calls the unhappy hour.
he will make up the test or something.
it's no big deal.
this whole woman thing is hard.
it took me an hour and a half to do this makeup.
I used everything I had.
you're supposed to, right?
I...
think you can probably save some for tomorrow.
I knew it was too much.
sorry.
still not used to heels.
I need more practice.
maybe I should've stayed home.
come on. The doctor said the best thing for your memory...
familiar surroundings.
I know you don't remember the last two years, but I know you remember being Alex.
he was a fantastic editor.
but in fashion, two years is a lifetime.
Plus, now I'm the new guy.
I mean, chick.
do chicks say "chick"?
and why is everyone staring at my chest?
I don't know. You might button another button, maybe try a bra.
it's boobs. It's crazy. They're everywhere.
Oh, honey, no, no, no.
ladies' room, now.
friends don't let friends wear glitter before noon.
Yeah.
Yeah. This is...
Phat.
What'd I tell you?
and as soon as this baby drops, I'm gonna bust out of accounting, man.
I'M-A be chillin' under Rihanna's umbrella...ella.
Oh, uh, super phat.
Uh-oh, lady parts, 12: 00.
I don't know how you do it, man.
you got this piece stalking you. You got a baby mama back home.
you gotta teach me, young skywalker. Come on!
obi-wan's the t...never mind.
just get out of here. - Hey, henry.
I'm just gonna give you two some space here.
so I was wondering... - save it, b-money.
Charlie hasn't heard back yet about the paternity test.
dude! - What?
sound does not stop right here, man.
would you just...
actually, I'm not here to talk about us...
for a change. It's Justin.
he's failing algebra. - What?
so I was thinking, since you're, like, a math genius, uh, - maybe you could tutor him? - Sure. Definitely.
he needs his algebra. I mean, we use it every day.
great. Okay.
thank you.
um, so...
I guess I'll see you later?
Yeah.
forget something? - Bye, Kenny.
I'm just looking for some shoes.
Ah.
you can't just leave the reception desk empty.
Oh, my god.
are you making out with that dog again?
HALSTON and I needed a little me time.
searching for our real father is exhausting.
can I spoon, too?
so I'm guessing no luck finding daddy?
nada.
I googled Fey. I searched this stupid room. I read her diary.
it's useless. - So Fey never mentioned any men?
not a word maybe we need to find some pictures.
every month, the back page of "Mode" was filled with pictures of Fey at different parties.
go find some old issues and see who Fey was socializing with the year of your birth.
wait. What year were you born?
1991
you're 16?
1992. - Other way.
now I'm moving up the British new rave piece.
I want a rewrite on "the five ways to fake it,"
and, Phillip, the trash can is going to enjoy your snooze-inducing profile on Sienna Miller.
look who's back, everyone.
Oh! Alexis.
so good to see you, darling. You...
look fabulous. - I'm not wearing a bra.
Ah.
power move.
I thought we could bring Alexis up to speed on the January issue.
