bouandel narrated an anecdote to al jazeera, describing a function at the university of benghazi some years ago when gaddafi wanted to take notes of what speakers were saying.
bouandel said the choice of flag did not indicate a particular predilection towards returning to a monarchical structure-as the original flag was used by the country when it was ruled by the el-senussi family-rather it was a reaction against gaddafi, and an expression of a desire for independence.
bouazizi complained about the greed of local officers for years.
bouazizi died of his injuries days later.
bouazizi finally died on jan. 4.
bouazizi for example paid 3 dinars a day for the regular use of a location on the street--what the ild calls an "extralegal property right."
bouazizi is of course not the only hero of the arab spring.
bouazizi lingered for weeks after setting himself on fire.
bouazizi might have tried legalizing his business by establishing a small sole proprietorship.
bouazizi symbolised the combination of drift and what arabs call ihbat (extreme frustration), the bane of a generation.
bouazizi's sacrifice was experienced by the entire arab world as a call for uprising.
bouazizi's suicide was seized on by a savvy network of young unemployed university graduates, who fed pictures of protests to al jazeera, the pan-arab channel with a unique power of mobilisation in the region, and disseminated them through facebook.

opc is a generic principle.
opec appears to be sticking by its production cuts, overall supply is down and it feels like the global economy may be leveling off.
opec claims that the world is amply supplied with oil and seems content with a price around$ 100 a barrel.
opec cut production to shore price of measures have been the recent focus of attention of the market.
opec estimates iran produced 3.424 million barrels of oil a day in february, which is off around 5.4% from the 2011 average.
opec has previously expressed scepticism about alternative energy but mr el-badri's comments mark the first clear threat that the cartel might act to safeguard its interests in the face of a shift towards biofuels.
opec hopes that by cutting output it can put a break on diving oil prices that have been dramatic in recent weeks.
opec is able to function because its members have most of the oil and the market is global and fungible.
opec is expected to supply just over half the world's oil supply by 2030, compared with about 40% today, as non-opec production falls.
opec is likely to keep its official output levels unchanged today.
opec may not be able to realise its formal ability to collude. But other commodity markets also suffer from effective, if informal, cartelisation.
opec members could retaliate by selling some of their huge reserves of dollars-which would hit the dollar and us consumers very hard.
opec members have been slow to comply with the production cut of 1.5 million barrels a day agreed to in october.
opec nations have about two thirds of the world's proven conventional crude reserves, and one third of its production capacity.
opec oil ministers will hold their next meeting in vienna on june 8.
opec president chakib khelil today (thursday) blamed soaring oil prices on a weak dollar, but said he does not think oil prices will hit 200-dollars a barrel.
opec said the u. s.would import less than two million barrels a day in 2035, almost three-quarters less than it does today.
opec supplies about 40% of global oil demand.
opec surely heeds the lesson of u.s. natural gas, where high prices led to the development of shale gas, causing prices to tank.
opec was created to co-ordinate restraints on oil production to keep prices high.
opec will have to cut output of lower-quality grades because of weak demand, iran's opec governor said today.
opec will make the underproduction decision also possibly to weaken the crude oil demand.
opec's gathering in quito two days ago was the seventh meeting with no change in output quotas.
opec's hawks venezuela and iran were pushing for a deeper reduction, while other countries supported a medium-size cut now and another probably in december.
opec's output rise has so far failed to cool oil prices.
opec, meanwhile, amassed enormous wealth from oil exports and the growth of oecd nations was slowed with the oil shock.

opel is not a basket case.
opel is of critical importance to gm's future. Its products and engineering are tightly interwoven with all the company's other operations.
opel later said it did not need the help anyway.
opel was supposed to make a purely commercial decision on its buyer.
opel's powerful labor unions have voiced their support for a deal with magna, while opposing a sale to baic due to concerns about a possible technology transfer.
opel, which gm acquired in 1929, accounts for about three-quarters of gm europe's sales and operates under the vauxhall brand name in britain.
opel/ vauxhall is not competitive in its present state, despite presentable products and a 7% share of the market in western europe.
