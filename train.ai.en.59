Yeah. But I asked you to give her a lollipop. Be...
Yeah. But I bet we're in a different time zone.
Yeah. But I brought you a gift anyway.
Yeah. But I can call and tell him I can't if you want me...
Yeah. But I can try.
Yeah. But I can't go.
Yeah. But I can't run if I can't walk.
Yeah. But I confessed.
Yeah. But I couldn't leave you.
Yeah. But I decided to play the long game.
Yeah. But I didn't do it till the first semester of my junior year.
Yeah. But I didn't do it. I was clean.
Yeah. But I didn't kill anyone.
Yeah. But I didn't know you two knew each other.
Yeah. But I didn't mean to kill him.
Yeah. But I don't feel any motion, do you?
Yeah. But I don't know about that.
Yeah. But I don't know that, you know?
Yeah. But I don't think she had any phone money with her or anything.
Yeah. But I don't think you should.
Yeah. But I don't want to have to get you a father's day gift every year.
Yeah. But I don't want to.
Yeah. But I don't... - $50.
Yeah. But I doubt if conjugal visits are permitted in a prison bus.
Yeah. But I feel bad about it.
Yeah. But I got one, too!
Yeah. But I got one, too! Really?
Yeah. But I got the basics down.
Yeah. But I guess I look for fun first,
Yeah. But I guess there are... Greater tragedies.
Yeah. But I had a nasty habit - I wanted to eat regularly.
Yeah. But I had no idea that the water would be that cold.
Yeah. But I had to drop out after a semester because my mom got sick.
Yeah. But I had to get up early and film a deodorant commercial.
Yeah. But I have to shoot and edit it.
Yeah. But I have to tell you something.
Yeah. But I have to tell you something.
Yeah. But I kind of like it.
Yeah. But I know you.
Yeah. But I let you kiss my mom.
Yeah. But I like it.
Yeah. But I look good, right?
Yeah. But I mean, you didn't shoot anybody.
Yeah. But I never came back outside again, so -
Yeah. But I outrank you.
Yeah. But I ran into trouble on one of them.
Yeah. But I think I have to find one less guru - like.
Yeah. But I think it's her you have to worry about.
Yeah. But I think you went overboard.
Yeah. But I told him what was up.
Yeah. But I told you, I didn't kill anybody.
Yeah. But I tut,tut,tut, take it back.
Yeah. But I want to get some popcorn.
Yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Yeah. But I was really beginning to like him.
Yeah. But I was wrong.
Yeah. But I wasn't there for you like the others.
Yeah. But I won't be.
Yeah. But I won't let him.
Yeah. But I would like to... Rephrase the question.
Yeah. But I would never sandbag somebody that I love.
Yeah. But I'd go a little thinner on the crust.
Yeah. But I'd settle for sex.
Yeah. But I'd still like to have another cup of coffee.
Yeah. But I'll take her.
Yeah. But I'm actually late.
Yeah. But I'm feeling better right now.
Yeah. But I'm gonna find out why these two died.
Yeah. But I'm gonna have to charge you first, all right?
Yeah. But I'm gonna have to charge you first, all right?
Yeah. But I'm guessing it didn't tickle, either.
Yeah. But I'm hoping to see you soon.
Yeah. But I'm just here today for a cleaning.
Yeah. But I'm not drinking...
Yeah. But I'm not supposed to.
Yeah. But I'm still going to need to see photo ID.
Yeah. But I'm the one with the sash.
Yeah. But I'm... But I'm sure some of this stuff
Yeah. But I've been praying she won't go.
Yeah. But I've decided to stay on a more permanent basis.
Yeah. But I've got an inside man.
Yeah. But I've got to be off like a prom dress.
Yeah. But I've never given her any reason to imagine the worst.
Yeah. But I've never seen you before.
Yeah. But I... - tut - tut - tut, take it back.
Yeah. But I... Tut - tut - tut, take it back.
Yeah. But Poe's scary as hell, and that's cool.
Yeah. But a couple of weeks ago, my funding got cut off.
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait'til it's over.
Yeah. But after that you go your own way.
Yeah. But after years of always joking ,
Yeah. But also, I mean...
Yeah. But aren't there, like, 20 of them?
Yeah. But as someone once told me,
Yeah. But based on a lie. The king is not really coming.
Yeah. But brought you a gift anyway.
Yeah. But by the time someone is right for you, it won't feel like settling.
Yeah. But by whom? Where are they?
Yeah. But check out the jury.
Yeah. But containers get shifted all the time.
Yeah. But do you know that for sure?
Yeah. But don't be afraid. I think it's a way to find me, that's all.
Yeah. But don't be afraid. I think it's a way to find me, that's all.
Yeah. But don't feel obligated or anything,
Yeah. But don't hold it against me.
Yeah. But don't let her fool you. She's as cold as the ice she skates on.
Yeah. But don't stretch out too fast.
Yeah. But don't worry, doctor.
Yeah. But don't worry, it didn't go so good.
Yeah. But don't wrap it. She likes it when I wrap it myself.
Yeah. But even if you can believe half of it.
Yeah. But everyone is welcome. don't you see?
Yeah. But first, there's something else.
Yeah. But good luck with all that.
Yeah. But having a 300 IQ
Yeah. But he claims that he was forced to.
Yeah. But he didn't want her to know. He - he wanted me to tell her that his...
Yeah. But he doesn't even know that he's Jim.
Yeah. But he got away.
Yeah. But he got here later.
Yeah. But he looks so perfect out there, doesn't he?
Yeah. But he said "palace," he said it was a palace?
Yeah. But he thinks I'm a guy, so it's over before it even started.
Yeah. But he wasn't down for that,
Yeah. But he's making me feel bad about tiny nations.
Yeah. But he's not well.
Yeah. But he's pretty hard to read.
Yeah. But here's the best part. You want to hear the best part?
Yeah. But here's the thing.
Yeah. But his permanent address.
Yeah. But how did -
Yeah. But how did you know I would like it?
Yeah. But how does it work?
Yeah. But how faraway can that be?
Yeah. But how. Far away can that be?
Yeah. But how. Far away can that be?
Yeah. But if Cece finds out,
Yeah. But if I do, you'll kill me.
Yeah. But if I would've known that,
Yeah. But if it makes you feel better, it's also because you're very white.
Yeah. But if the lights are on out here,
Yeah. But if we ever get married, we'll have to talk about this in therapy.
Yeah. But if you get caught, that's it. You're expelled.
Yeah. But in return they get to be a lot thinner than I am.
Yeah. But in the right jacket...
Yeah. But in this case, I don't think he's your suspect.
Yeah. But it comes easier for me.
Yeah. But it did happen.
Yeah. But it didn't work out.
Yeah. But it doesn't make any sense. It does if someone came looking for us.
Yeah. But it doesn't make any sense.
Yeah. But it has to be landed.
Yeah. But it helps if you've got something that nobody can live without.
Yeah. But it might not be a terrible idea
Yeah. But it not coming from here.
Yeah. But it was a very tall ladder.
Yeah. But it was nothing.
Yeah. But it was the running that got him.
Yeah. But it wasn't a fair fight.
Yeah. But it wasn't pills. It was liquid.
Yeah. But it wasn't your dad.
Yeah. But it would be more polite
Yeah. But it's Norway.
Yeah. But it's above your kindergarten education.
Yeah. But it's above your kindergarten education.
Yeah. But it's better than being a birdbrain.
Yeah. But it's difficult to shift. Isn't it? difficult to store.
Yeah. But it's gonna take me a while to figure out
Yeah. But it's gonna take me a while to figure out
Yeah. But it's good to see you.
Yeah. But it's just been so crazy busy around here
Yeah. But it's me on the picture.
Yeah. But it's not like a.
Yeah. But it's not that.
Yeah. But it's not unusual for an ambulance to go to a hospital.
Yeah. But it's not what I wanna really be writing about anymore.
Yeah. But it's pouring out of her backwards.
Yeah. But it's sometimes not easy to tell whether if they've heard you making yourself known.
Yeah. But it's still a risk.
Yeah. But it's ultra exclusive.
Yeah. But it's very persal.
Yeah. But just part - time. The part where I'm not at the church.
Yeah. But just to be on the safe side,
Yeah. But l don't really care about the supreme court. What do you think?
Yeah. But l... Tut - tut - tut, take it back.
Yeah. But later they will.
Yeah. But let me call you back. There's somebody here.
Yeah. But listen, I really should go. Yeah. I'll call you later.
Yeah. But listen. You are going back to high school.
Yeah. But maybe you can make it up to me in some special way.
Yeah. But money's money.
Yeah. But mostly I feel that way about you.
Yeah. But murder?
Yeah. But my assistant already spoke to them. Their credentials check out.
Yeah. But my assistant already spoke to them.
Yeah. But my decision is final. She's not invited.
Yeah. But my favorite episode has to be the one where they all go scuba diving.
Yeah. But my friend Terri once went out with a guy
Yeah. But no one can read them. I was experimenting with cubism.
Yeah. But no, no.
Yeah. But not as beautiful
Yeah. But not for a long time.
Yeah. But not for a long time.
Yeah. But not for long.
Yeah. But not for me.
Yeah. But not for publication. Just for us!
Yeah. But not just the cookies, though.
Yeah. But not just yet.
Yeah. But not me.
Yeah. But not the earlier ones.
Yeah. But not the right time.
Yeah. But not too ugly.
Yeah. But now it's true. Man.
Yeah. But now we're wondering
Yeah. But now, apparently,
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Yeah. But once the monkey goes South, that's the end of it.
Yeah. But once you start the fire...
Yeah. But one would be good.
Yeah. But only after he refused to leave.
Yeah. But our divorce is final next week. Okay.
Yeah. But our killer's not opportunistic.
Yeah. But our parents died when he was ten.
Yeah. But please don't pull her folks in this. They don't like me much.
Yeah. But prep him on how to order it:
Yeah. But really. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?
Yeah. But really. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?
Yeah. But she didn't call it a junkyard, she called it an antique yard.
Yeah. But she didn't take the job yet,
Yeah. But she digs him, and he's invited her to the prom.
Yeah. But she hasn't told us anything about it.
Yeah. But she said you were dead too.
Yeah. But she saw me take a swing, and she told me...
Yeah. But she saw me take a swing, and she told me...
Yeah. But she's locked away in a parallel world.
Yeah. But she's out of your League.
Yeah. But she's probably been up all night worrying.
Yeah. But she's the best receptionist we have ever had.
Yeah. But she's the one. I know it.
Yeah. But she's totally hammered...
Yeah. But size!
Yeah. But sizes!
Yeah. But smuggling escaped felons is not on my to - do list.
Yeah. But some people refer to me as'sorry - ass truck guy.
Yeah. But somebody's gotta tell him about his new lawyer.
Yeah. But speed doesn't wanna
Yeah. But still,
Yeah. But thanks.
Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I'll hold that in reserve.
Yeah. But that was a great dive, by the way.
Yeah. But that was a hibachi. That was for traveling.
Yeah. But that's all right. You've been taking risks all your life.
Yeah. But that's fried. It's not healthy.
Yeah. But that's fried. It's not healthy. Oh, come on. Have some of the fried...
Yeah. But that's fried. It's not healthy. Oh, come on. Have some of the fried...
Yeah. But that's not why I do it.
Yeah. But that's what I'm saying. Why is that you always have the keys?
Yeah. But that... You know, whatever.
Yeah. But the champagne glass...
Yeah. But the dancing wasn't very good.
Yeah. But the date on that ticket stub is after the plane crash.
Yeah. But the economy hit hard
Yeah. But the fire - suppression system sucked all the oxygen out of the room.
Yeah. But the high - pitched part isn't so easy.
Yeah. But the one with the round in it was sitting practically on top.
Yeah. But the pricks cancelled yesterday.
Yeah. But the real reason I'm here is because...
Yeah. But the show's been over for years.
Yeah. But the thing is,
Yeah. But the wound's clean.
Yeah. But then I changed my mind.
Yeah. But then I got to thinking...
Yeah. But then he was killed in the line of duty
Yeah. But then maybe I needed...
Yeah. But then we figured out
Yeah. But then we keep it in a box
Yeah. But then you fainted and squashed one of the space cows.
Yeah. But then you never leave hotels,
Yeah. But then, you know, she never liked you.
Yeah. But there is the pasta.
Yeah. But there may not be another time. Okay?
Yeah. But there was something underneath it.
Yeah. But there's got to be dozens of prints over there. Yeah.
Yeah. But there's no pain, there's no numbness,
Yeah. But there's no way out.
Yeah. But these are their old faces.
Yeah. But they all require hours for certification.
Yeah. But they are closing the building for the next 3 days
Yeah. But they couldn't go home,
Yeah. But they have no kids, and we like the fact that you have a kid.
Yeah. But they offered me 150 grand.
Yeah. But they're beating him up pretty good.
Yeah. But they're good ones. I know!
Yeah. But they're great. Huh?
Yeah. But they're moving it the day after tomorrow.
Yeah. But they're not your fans.
Yeah. But think of the upside -
Yeah. But this could be one and clone.
Yeah. But this is not that.
Yeah. But this is not the way to deal with things.
Yeah. But this is the girl you remember?
Yeah. But those clouds have a silver lining
Yeah. But those girls are called prostitutes.
Yeah. But those other fish want to fuck me. This fish doesn't.
Yeah. But under what circumstances
Yeah. But we all keep secrets for our own reasons. I don't think I have to tell you that.
Yeah. But we both know you don't want to be married to me.
Yeah. But we can get some here.
Yeah. But we can't go back.
Yeah. But we didn't check incident reports.
Yeah. But we don't live with the consequences.
Yeah. But we got lucky.
Yeah. But we got the vote later, I...
Yeah. But we had Spanish 102 together.
Yeah. But we have to be very discreet,
Yeah. But we have to be very discreet,
Yeah. But we have to know for sure.
Yeah. But we try to be upbeat and positive as much as we can.
Yeah. But we're not open yet.
Yeah. But we're together. The old team.
Yeah. But what I did read wasn't half bad.
Yeah. But what I did read wasn't half bad.

Yeah. But what if I told you I found something?
Yeah. But what if she lied to him like she lied to me?
Yeah. But what if...
