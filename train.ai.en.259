hms dauntless, one of the uk's largest and most powerful air defence destroyers, has set sail for the falkland islands.

hna also intends to bulk up in financial services.
hna and bravia purchased a$ 3bn portfolio of aircraft leasing assets in 2010.
hna and grand china have expanded aggressively inside and outside china but have frustrated many shipowners by often failing to pay promptly.
hna and hong kong-based bravia trumped a number of us-based private equity and other companies to win the deal on monday, highlighting the growing influence of chinese capital in financing the infrastructure of global trade.
hna declined to comment, while kelso did not respond to a request for comment.
hna did not respond to requests for comment but has previously said non-payment was common in light of this year's poor dry bulk market.
hna group, an opaque but highly acquisitive conglomerate, is a notable exception.
hna is a chinese conglomerate with a large logistics division, several airlines, a property arm, hotels and banks.
hna itself purchased a$ 3bn portfolio of aircraft leasing assets from allco, the collapsed australian finance company, in 2010 alongside bravia capital, a us private equity group.
hna last week backed out of deal to take a 20% stake in spanish hotel chain nh hoteles, paying$ 15 million breakup fee.
hna paid 7 per share for new stock issued by nh hoteles, a price one-third higher than at the close of the madrid stock market on monday.
hna said it planned to "increase the size of ge seaco significantly," which may stoke concerns about potential oversupply in the container leasing market.
hna's interest could create uncertainty for other operators in the fragmented market for container leasing.
