despite the unfortunate circumstances, it does prove your innocence, but you're also the only person standing between your husband and his new life.
I could put Jeremy behind bars.
you're a loose end, and we believe Jeremy might come after you next.
we need to get you out of town.
they're entering the building.
NYPD! Open up!
Vanessa, time to go. Come on.
hands up!
nobody move!
yo, keep 'em up.
what the hell?
who gave us this intel?
someone called in a tip.
a Mr. Swan.
report back to base, now.
any idea how the police ended up on the wrong side of town?
ms. Morgan gave me a tip regarding an underground gambling ring.
I just wanted to make sure the police discovered and stopped it.
so you left the SUV they were looking for near the building.
of course I didn't.
Mr. Reese took care of that.
I was merely doing my civic duty.
are you okay? - I don't know.
you're leaving your life behind.
that's a scary thing.
have you ever had to start over because someone was trying to kill you?
you could say that.
come here.
Jeremy wants me dead. He'll find me.
Vanessa, you're smart. You're strong.
if I were Jeremy, I'd know better than to come after you.
I don't know if I'll ever feel safe.
all right.
maybe this will help.
it's loaded.
thank you. For everything.
you're welcome.
your, um, bus leaves soon.
Yeah.
don't want to miss it.
I appreciate you letting me eavesdrop.
no problem.
my lunch hour is over, though.
better get back before Cameron turns the troops... on me.
something wrong, Detective?
most people think that sweaty palms or an increased heart rate are the only involuntary responses your body gives when you lie.
they would be wrong.
her husband tried to frame her for his murder.
can't blame her for being angry.
except she tore that picture before she knew he was still alive and before she knew about the affair with Nicole, when she told me she loved him.
maybe she did love him.
I've taken the liberty of revisiting the H-Said database.
Henry Shain didn't obtain his own passport to leave the country.
his wife did it for him, and she procured one for herself too.
Jeremy wasn't the only one with a false passport.
Vanessa made that SOS call to the Coast Guard.
she helped Jeremy fake his death.
Vanessa's been in on the plot from the beginning.
she and Jeremy planned to empty out the accounts of their so-called charity and run away with the spoils.
until he double-crossed her and framed her for his own murder.
Jeremy deceived Vanessa, and Vanessa deceived us.
Mr. Reese, Vanessa was lying when she said she loved her husband.
she helped him fake his death.
are you still with her?
she's boarding her bus.
are you sure?
Vanessa's not on the bus, Finch. She's gone.
she knows her husband is still alive and that he framed her for his murder.
she despises him.
she's gonna kill him.
Vanessa's been the perpetrator all along.
she's been plotting her husband's murder since he framed her.
which means her crime is premeditated.
and I gave her a weapon. - You what?
seemed like a good idea at the time.
we find Jeremy, we find her.
he needs to get out of New York.
I know one mode of transportation no one's checking.
anything to report?
I think my new partner is starting to trust me.
and I saw her boyfriend.
maybe you know him.
Nicole, I'm home!
expecting someone else?
no, no, no, I just, um
Hey, what took you so long? You were supposed to meet me yesterday.
but today's better.
cops just released the crime scene. We are free to go.
you duplicitous son of a bitch.
this is all a misunderstanding.
I mean, you know I still love you, right, angel?
now, come on. We can make this work.
get out of New York. Ditch the boat. Make a new life.
hard to save your marriage after you frame your wife for murder.
who the hell are you?
a concerned third party.
well, so happy that you found someone else, angel.
truly. Good for you.
he's not my "someone else."
he's just someone I can't get rid of.
Oh, come on, we both knew that our marriage was just a contract.
not to me it wasn't.
I thought you meant it when you told me we could disappear, get out from under the debt, make a new home, make a new life for us. Just us.
I helped you fake your death, swore to the Coast Guard I'd seen your body disappear so they could declare you dead, just like we planned.
until you framed me and robbed our charity.
to what? Run off with Nicole?
maybe you're right, that our marriage is just a contract, but if that's true, you owe me.
well, look at you.
so angry, bitter.
and you used to be so beautiful.
you led the police to believe I shot you on a yacht, then threw your body overboard.
who can blame me for doing what everyone says I already did?
do something.
you framed your own wife for murder.
you deceived me to kill your own husband.
I'm in the business of stopping bad things from happening.
I'm not so sure what's about to happen is a bad thing.
Mr. Reese, how's Ms. Watkins?
don't know.
but you might want to call the Coast Guard.
and you owe Shaw 100 bucks.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considers these people irrelevant.
we don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
open the door!
that's a human liver.
we have to get that to City General. A patient's life depends on it.
our boss's life depends on it more.
drop the gun, or your friend is gonna get it.
here's your liver.
look, Belinda, or whatever your name is...
you just saved my life. How can I ever possibly
Ugh. All done here, Finch.
not to be a stickler about etiquette, Ms. Shaw, but I believe that Mr. Mathers was in the midst of thanking you.
you paid me to save him, not listen to him talk.
and while your combat skills are impressive, your bedside manner still leaves a little something to be desired.
I was thinking you might stop by, and we could discuss it over a nice cup of tea.
well, as fun as that sounds, Finch, I'll pass.
I don't like meeting out in the open like this, Yogorov.
relax, Simmons.
this place was on the map you gave us.
you see any cameras?
so, Terney? - Yeah.
what's the status on our joint operation?
everything's in place.
our part's good to go. We just need you to arrange the meeting.
no problem.
we'll get all the players in one room.
one very secure room.
if our boss is gonna be involved, this has gotta be airtight.
one of these days, I'm just gonna shoot you.
I get that a lot.
busted, huh?
Finch and I have known about your side project for a while.
from what we've seen, you've got enough to bring down half the organization.
you could bust them, make deals to take down the rest.
special Agent Donnelly tried that.
but HR rebuilt itself from ashes 'cause we didn't cut off the head.
if we had, Cal might still be alive.
I'm playing by different rules now.
no deals.
and I won't make a move until I can bring down the boss.
they're running some joint operation with the Russians.
if I can just get eyes on that meeting,
I might finally ID the head of HR.
need help? - No.
but if I do, you'll be my first call.
Finch, I thought you said we had a new number.
we do, but this one doesn't match any social security number on record.
the nine digits in question are a USCIS alien registration number.
green Card number.
we're looking for an immigrant.
specifically, Ms. Genrika Zhirova of Solntsevo, Russia.
information on Ms. Zhirova is a little hard to come by.
she has virtually no digital footprint.
all I have so far is a last known address.
it's a housing project in the South Bronx.
I can't even find a photo of the woman.
then let's go have a look at her.
agent Stone, Immigration and Customs.
I'm looking for Genrika Zhirova.
no eyes on the target yet, but I see drugs at her place.
could have something to do with why we're here.
rough neighborhood. Whatever this woman's into,
I got a feeling it's gonna get messy.
can I help you?
Y...You're Genrika?
gen. Nobody calls me Genrika.
are your parents here?
my mom's in prison in Russia.
I never knew my dad.
I came here a few years ago to live with my grandfather.
and where is he? - Cemetery.
he died eight months ago.
shouldn't you guys already know this stuff?
so now you live with, um... - Vadim.
we're, like, third cousins or something.
he's supposed to be taking care of me now.
which means he gets an extra 200 a month and a free place to live.
they should pay me twice that to put up with her.
always sneaking around, taking pictures.
crazy little girl thinks she's a spy.
I'm just practicing for my career.
career doing what?
international espionage.
what's this about?
just a routine check. - Routine, my ass.
is there a problem with my immigration status?
no. I... - Why'd they send you?
agent Cross normally handles my case.
there is no Agent Cross.
look, uh, do you need any help here?
I'm fine, but you're making me late for school.
ms. Shaw's conversation with Ms. Zhirova was, if not harmonious, at least illuminating.
four years ago, her mother was in prison for protesting the Putin administration.
so her grandfather brought Gen here to live with him.
now she's all alone.
not exactly the safest place for a kid.
and cousin Vadim's no Suzy Homemaker.
well, whatever's going on...
I doubt this girl's the perpetrator.
I wouldn't be surprised if the recent changes in her circumstances have something to do with the threat.
perhaps, Ms. Shaw, had you been a touch more solicitous when asking her - if she needed help... - What? I asked, she said no.
if you ask me, the kid can take care of her...
is everything all right?
you're not gonna believe this, Finch.
Shaw just got made by a ten-year-old.
what kind of a weird-ass kid uses countersurveillance tactics?
I got it from here.
but I think you freaked her out a little.
it's mutual. I'll recon her building.
Mr. Reese, we need to have a talk about Ms. Shaw.
don't worry, I've got us up on a private line.
look, it won't do to save this little girl's life only to have her scared to death by Ms. Shaw.
perhaps it would be best if we kept her at arm's length from Ms. Zhirova.
fine with me, I hate kids.
ms. Shaw? - What, Finch?
you think I didn't bug your office?
we've got trouble, Finch.
Hey! Get her!
whoever this girl is, Finch, she has a very grown-up problem. Come on.
911 emergency.
I just saw an accident.
a tire blew, and the driver lost control.
please send someone.
I need an ETA on that bus!
and get a back brace ready, just in case!
the top's completely collapsed. - I'll try to get to the driver.
driver's DOA.
someone's alive in there.
I can't see 'em.
I'll check the other side.
Hey, there. Are you hurt?
I don't think so.
is my dad okay?
what's your name, sweetheart? - Sameen.
okay, Sameen, hang on, kiddo.
I'm coming to you, okay?
well, Finch, so much for keeping me away from the kid.
ms. Zhirova. Is she safe? - For now. But I don't think our tangos have given up.
me either.
sub-basement. A few floors down.
hold your position.
I'm on my way. Any idea what this is about?
do you know who those men were or why they tried to grab you?
probably because I'm a spy.
she doesn't know.
so we have no idea who's after her?
the guy giving orders had a tremor in his hand.
could be Parkinson's.
it's a rare enough condition. It might help us to identify him.
all right, John, I'll meet you at the northeast corner. - No. Please stay put, Ms. Shaw.
Mr. Reese will come to you.
your job is to protect Ms. Zhirova at all costs.
sir, yes, sir.
I thought you might be a robot.
no hits for Parkinson's in the database, but if you're looking for bad guys, you've gone to the right place.
your girl lives in an impact zone.
well, that doesn't sound good.
her address is in a blind spot where funding for domain awareness ran out.
criminals like to go where the cameras aren't.
no sign of our friend in the suit.
but she's on another one of her secret calls.
definitely up to something.
find out what.
gotta go.
Carter, where were you last night?
a bunch of us went out for drinks. I left you a message.
new gun, Laskey?
like it? I just bought it last weekend.
gun show in Jersey.
so you brought it across state lines illegally?
you do know that every gun in New York has to have a ballistics test on file, right?
nice.
you guys have the girl yet?
we're closing in, but she has help.
what's your name? - Not important.
well, who are you?
why are you here?
how'd you know I was gonna be in trouble? - How's it going, John?
still clearing our extraction route, same as I was two minutes ago.
who's John?
is he your friend?
is he your boyfriend? - No.
he's a coworker.
"Coworker." So this is your job?
what are you? Like, Spec Ops or something?
Oh, man! What agency do you work for?
CIA? NSA?
INSCOM?
why would a big agency like that care what happens to me?
we're not a big agency.
why would a small agency care what happens to me?
we're not any agency.
we're just a...
I don't even know what we are.
to be honest, I'm only in it for the dog.
you guys have a dog?
no sign of 'em here.
clear. Check the next room. - I got eyes on two tangos, Finch.
I'm taking 'em out. - Absolutely not!
if anything happened to you, Ms. Zhirova would be defenseless.
let Mr. Reese worry about the kidnappers.
you just get the girl out of there. Now.
we can handle it. - All right.
come on.
there they are! - Run.
let's move!
this way.
it's okay. I'm in here all the time.
my listening station.
we should be safe here.
you did all this?
told you I was a spy.
but I didn't do this.
Finch. I think I might know what this is all about.
gen has this whole building wired, and it looks like someone found out what she was up to.
any idea who?
did any of the people you ever recorded talk about committing any crimes?
lots of them.
I bugged anyone who looked suspicious.
did it ever occur to you that that might have been a really bad idea?
I was just trying to get the drug dealers out of my building.
did you give the tapes to anyone?
not yet. New York's just like Russia
you can't trust the cops.
I was waiting till I had something on the dealers that was too big to ignore.
Yeah, they're not ignoring you, kid.
well, I know that now.
so where are the tapes? - Somewhere safe.
Hey.
I'm a spy too, remember?
got a location on the tapes, Finch.
you're gonna wanna write this down.
clear.
Hey.
we got rats in the walls, but I got a plan.
get the masks from the trunk. Let's go!
you all right? - I'm fine.
I'm Shaw. - Nice to meet you.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
my grandfather taught me. He was in the KGB.
gave me this too.
order of Lenin.
I wear it everywhere I go.
you should sell it. Probably worth a lot of money.
what's wrong with you?
I mean, why are you...
like this?
you know that thing that made you flinch?
I don't get that.
you don't get scared? - Or sad.
or happy or lonely.
I do angry okay, but...
that's about it. - Did something happen?
been this way as long as I can remember. I was, uh...
about your age...
when I figured out I was different.
what's that?
they must have punctured the pipes for the building's AC.
we'll be dizzy in 10 seconds, unconscious in 40.
what happens after that?
you don't wanna know. Come on.
Shaw! No!
Hey, so talk to me, Sameen. You like TV?
what's your favorite show?
I don't have one.
they're different everywhere you go.
Oh, you move around a lot?
Yeah. My dad's in the military.
he likes TV.
we watch football together.
we'll you're being a trooper just like him.
we're gonna call your mom, okay?
and she's gonna come and take care of you.
ready to get outta here?
we got the kid. Take out the trash.
maybe clean out your trunk next time, dumbass.
do you have her?
no, we were hoping that you had.
but I'm glad to know you're still alive.
that makes one of us.
any clue where they took her?
we're working on it.
bear could only track Ms.Zhirova
gen. Her name is Gen.
he could only track Gen as far as the street.
she could be anywhere in the city by now.
the guy who kidnapped me... isn't talking.
but, uh, I got his cell.
it might lead us to the guy with the tremor. Give me his location.
I'll handle the rest.
bear found blood, Shaw. A lot of it.
and he seems to think it's yours.
I'm fine.
I'm sending you the address of a doctor who owes us a favor.
John can track the man with the tremors.
and I think I finally have the means to determine why she was abducted.
I've recovered Gen's tapes right where she said they were.
a girl after my own heart.
I know this went sideways, Finch.
but you can't bench me for every mistake.
I'm not punishing you for an error.
I'm protecting you because you're hurt.
you've done enough, Ms.Shaw.
we'll take it from here.
what are we doing here? This is way off our beat.
lunch. You're welcome.
come on. Do you really wanna wait in that line for a taco?
no, I want you to wait for two tacos, extra bulgogi, and some kimchi slaw.
plus whatever you want.
any problems, you call me. We clear?
joint operation's on schedule.
good. The package has been delivered. Pay the man.
Hey. - Look, something came up.
take the car and cover for me. I'll make my way back to the precinct.
lost my appetite.
no, man. It's your turn to call for pizza, man.
I don't wanna call...
read the labels, Harold.
ms. Shaw, everything all right?
do you know who took Gen? - Not yet.
but I can't help noticing that you are nowhere near the doctor that I recommended. In fact, you seem to be...
you wanna tell me why you're holding the same junk as the guys who took Gen?
sit down, Vadim.
got a little something for you.
Mmm, good, huh?
it'd be a shame to see it all go to waste.
now I can either re-up your stash, or I can flush it all.
stupid kid.
bugging people's rooms.
they sweep for transmitters.
who uses wires anymore?
but they find the wire, then they find recorders. Then they find me.
you told them about Gen?
they knew already. They give me this.
they tell me to find the tapes and not to report it if she went missing.
who?
the-- the Russians.
I don't know if you realize, but you're asking a lot.
I don't know if you realize, but I'm not asking.
Finch, I'm closing in on the kidnapper's cell.
I don't know if you realize, but I'm not asking.
most accidents don't require a shovel.
most accidents don't require a shovel.
that's my guy.
paying my guy.
Finch, I know who has the girl.
so do I, Mr.Reese.
didn't anyone ever tell you it's not polite to spy on people, little girl?
now... where are the tapes?
so we called your mom, okay, Sameen?
she's coming right now.
Where's my dad? Is he stuck in the car too?
sweetheart, it was a really bad accident.
your dad got hurt.
then why are you with me?
you should be taking care of him. - Yeah, I wish I could, sweetie.
but sometimes people get hurt so bad that they fall asleep, and they don't wake up.
you mean he's dead?
look, I'm so sorry, Sameen.
if there was anything I could have done...
I'm hungry. Can I have a sandwich?
ms. Shaw you're still not at the doctor.
I must insist that you...
Finch, Carter knows how HR found Gen.
they ran her fingerprints.
every legal immigrant gets fingerprinted when they get to the country.
that still doesn't explain exactly what she has on HR.
how's our friend with the tremor?
awake, but not exactly a chatterbox.
perhaps we should let Mr.Yogorov and Detective Simmons do the talking.
what kind of joint operation?
one in our mutual interest.
my boss wants your people to stop moving the old product and try something new.
they ever say what the product is?
no, but one of your pictures may turn out to be worth a thousand words.
the tanker that you spotted bears a chemical formula on the side.
potassium permanganate.
commonly used in water treatment, but also a key ingredient in a dangerous new class of drugs.
synthetic cathinones.
otherwise known as bath salts.
so basically, HR's dealing drugs.
perhaps not simply dealing.
the drug may be intoxicating, but pure potassium permanganate is just toxic.
exposure produces symptoms similar to Parkinson's.
our new friend isn't sick.
he's been cooking designer drugs for HR.
thank you, Finch.
nitroglycerin.
it's highly unstable.
the slightest shock could set it off.
drop it, and it'll blow your knees off.
I'd hold steady if I were you.
so you've been making drugs for HR.
where do the Russians come in?
hr makes the stuff, the Russians move it.
they called in a big meeting.
with the head of HR?
the top dealers in town. HR wants the Russians to lay down the law, force 'em to stop selling coke,"H," whatever, start selling salts.
you get all that, Finch?
Yes, and I've found something in one of Gen's recordings that confirms it.
screw the Colombians. This stuff is made right here in the US of A.
all right, we've got a massive facility. City gets hooked, we all get rich.
so where's the cook site?
I only helped with the first batch, but a pipe burst.
I got hosed with whatever did this to me. After that, they moved-- someplace bigger.
please. That's all I know.
and I believe you.
Hey. Hey!
you can't just leave me here!
so HR is tailoring crime in the city to fit their needs, and we've got the tapes to prove it to the DEA.
look, Carter, I know you said no deals.
of course we trade the tapes for the girl.
are we really gonna leave him like that?
relax. It's just corn syrup.
we got a 911 call. Someone's having a heart attack?
sorry, we're required to check. If you'd just let us in...
what was that ambulance doing out front?
Where's the girl?
that's HR's deal.
the cops might kill a kid.
my people have standards.
you know where they make this stuff?
I just handle distribution.
ever try it? - Hell no.
my body's a temple.
have you left the country in the last six months? - No.
ever had unprotected sex?
Why? You offering?
no.
ever had hepatitis, malaria, Chagas disease, or babesiosis?
no. What the hell is this about? - I need blood.
so I'm taking yours.
you don't even know my blood type.
I'm AB Positive. Universal recipient.
get HR on the phone.
someone wants to talk with you.
put the girl on the phone, or I paint the walls with Yogorov's brains.
Shaw, is that you?
hang on, kiddo. I'm coming for you.
okay.
let's talk terms.
I'm copying the HR tapes.
but I have hours of analog audio and no way to speed up the process.
gen doesn't have hours, Finch.
we need to tell HR we're willing to trade the tapes for
way ahead of you, John.
you hired me to save Gen, not bust dirty cops.
so unless you got a better idea, Harold,
I'm gonna need those tapes.
we got a problem, Carter.
Shaw took the tapes.
she's meeting Simmons on Randall's Island to trade them for the girl.
but I'll be there to change the odds. - Need help?
if I do, you'll be my first call.
I got eyes on her. Her pal in the suit knows about the meet.
you're walking into an ambush. - No, he is.
you guys are with me.
Carter, there you are. Look.
I need to talk to you about something. - Yeah, we can talk all day tomorrow.
Hey, come on, Carter. I covered for you with the sarge.
and I need your advice.
I'm having a problem.
with somebody on the job.
all right, what is it?
Hey, not here.
I know a bar nearby.
all right, we're about to get the tapes and the man in the suit.
showtime, people.
prepare to fire on my order.
acknowledge.
acknowledge, one.
acknowledge, two.
where is everybody?
officer...
I'd like to report a kidnapping.
you win.
take her.
the girl's not here.
neither are the tapes.
looks like you got bad intel.
not a total loss.
it's about time you and I had a little talk.
gotta hand it to you, Finch.
this was a better idea.
Carter said Detective Terney was involved in the joint operation, so it seemed reasonable to assume that his GPS signal might lead us to the lab.
just tell me which way to go.
right. I hope.
there are hundreds of us, you know.
you really think you can win?
armies fall...one soldier at a time.
you ready to get out of here?
Hey, Finch, how much you know about chemistry?
enough.
two beers, Jerry. On me.
how you doing, Jer?
you gonna join me?
so what's the problem, Laskey?
well, for starters, my own partner won't even have a drink with me.
so you're having a problem with someone at work. Who?
you.
I mean, what's going on?
I'm supposed to have your back, but how can I help you if you don't even talk to me?
I'm fine. - Like hell you are.
with the secret phone calls in the night, ducking out in the middle of a shift, hush-hush meetings with some man in a suit. Who is he, anyway?
cause I don't think he's your boyfriend.
why are you so curious?
is it maybe because of this?
I know, Laskey.
I've known from the second your ass landed in my car.
do you have any idea what it's like?
what what's like?
riding around all day with an arrogant bitch who doesn't know her place.
they spared your life, but you keep pushing.
and now your pal in the suit is gonna pay the price.
trust me, he is not the one you should be worried about.
see, you just played Simmons for us.
we fed you bad info, and you got Simmons and his men away from the girl.
you know, when they, uh, assigned me to you, they told me to play the dumb rookie, see what I could find out.
but Simmons gave me the authority to pull your card anytime I want.
what ya think, Jerry?
should I earn myself a new partner?
you don't even know who you are yet, son.
do you?
but you wanna play Billy Badass? You go right ahead.
but I spent enough time with you to know you're afraid of me.
that's why you have your idiot friend here for backup.
I know you, Laskey.
just like I know Jerry back there is a lieutenant in Bronx Vice who paid for this bar with dirty cash from shaking down hookers.
and I have the proof to put him away for it.
now I was gonna wait and arrest you two with everyone else.
but if this is how you wanna play it, little man, guess I'll have to take you down right now.
you both can go easy... or it can be hard.
they should've killed you, you stupid bit.
put the gun down.
put it down!
sit down!
now we gotta figure this out.
figure this out? You just killed him. - No.
you did.
registered to you in the state of New Jersey.
all I gotta do is submit it for ballistics.
but I'm not gonna do that. Not yet.
you don't work for HR anymore, son.
you work for me now.
never seen anything like it.
I told her the news, and she understood, but...
I don't know.
I think there's something wrong with the kid.
what if I don't like it?
you lived with Vadim, you can live anywhere.
and it's supposed to be one of the top schools in the world.
not every kid gets to become the ward of a reclusive billionaire.
now if you're ever in trouble again, call this number.
don't sell it, okay?
I know it won't mean much to you, but it'll mean a lot to me that you have it.
I'm just not wired for this kind of stuff, kid.
I know.
I figured you out.
it's not that you don't have feelings.
it's just like...
the volume is turned way down.
like the sound on an old tape.
the voices are there.
you just have to listen.
Bye, Shaw.
you're hurting me.
so I, uh, disobeyed some...
pretty much all...
of your orders.
am I fired?
on the contrary, Ms.Shaw. I think you finally got the job.
now about that bug in my library...
haven't found it yet, have you?
did you miss me?
we're gonna have so much fun together.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considers these people irrelevant.
we don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
you won't believe what the Swede has been doing
going to the therapy.
how much does the therapist know?
are you resting comfortably?
Yes. But I should tell you that, I don't really believe in hypnotism.
the act of hypnosis is freewill.
for me to proceed, your mind must grant the permission.
will it work on me the first time?
most of my clients experience results in three to five sessions.
so we'll work on your anxiety and paranoia gradually.
see, Mr. Wren, hypnosis is merely relaxation combined with imagery.
you experience it every night as you drift asleep, focus on a book, or miss your exit on the FDR.
ready? - I think so, yes.
then let's begin. Please pick up the tablet beside you, and choose an image that speaks to your emotion.
Oh, this one.
I want you to close your eyes and form a mental picture of that image.
picture the birds, the field.
then one by one, picture them as they fly away.
focus on your breathing.
one bird departs. And as each one goes, your relaxation increases and you continue to feel calmer and more at rest.
for 200 bucks an hour, Finch,
I hope you get more than an expensive nap.
I want to take you back to a place in your life where you were safe and comfortable.
can you think of that place, Mr. Wren?
my childhood bedroom.
now, I want you to think of all the ways it made you feel safe.
picture it clear as day.
what color were the walls?
Hayden Price-- certified hypnotherapist to the Upper East Side.
does he do birthday parties?
it's not that kind of hypnotism, Mr. Reese.
he caters to wealthy businessmen and socialites.
anger management, smoking cessation, that sort of of thing.
or so you might think, if you didn't know that the office was rented on a short-term lease, and that his certification doesn't come from any association I can find.
during the therapy, I became attuned to the kind of questions that Hayden was asking.
a color that's favorable to you-- blue.
the name of a childhood pet-- Scout.
he was fishing--getting answers to your security questions.
my bank account was suddenly signed up for a recurring automatic donation to the nonprofit called "The American Cancer Coalition Fund.
I'd be willing the wager that Hayden's name is on that nonprofit.
so, unless he's moonlighting as a samaritan,
I'd say we're dealing with a con artist and a very clever thief.
so why'd you even play along, Finch?
I told Hayden what he wanted to hear.
I didn't even have a pet as a child.
but when I went to bluejack his phone, it was blocked.
someone had already jacked it, perhaps someone who's out to get him.
and his clients would be the best place to start.
I'll contact Shaw for back-up, but first I need to look in on our houseguest.
as before, Ms. Groves, Mr. Reese is upstairs with an unhealthy number of firearms. Please don't try to run.
honestly, Harold, locking me up?
I admit that the accommodations are not ideal.
but your confinement is for your own good.
Harold, your machine called me.
an event that I haven't fully reasoned out.
but your unpredictability, your willingness to hurt others make you as dangerous as ever.
you can't fight the future.
I'll bring you some new books.
I get it.
you wonder why it won't talk to you like it talks to me.
don't be jealous, Harold.
mom still loves us both.
when bluejacking Hayden didn't work,
I sent him a basket of pastries as a thank you.
bugged, of course.
I'm just so angry with her, I could kill her.
and those feelings will dissipate as you feel calmer, Mr. Sykes.
tell me about your mother.
speak her name, out loud-- her full name.
Mary Shackford Sykes. - Very good.
that's a start.
it seems therapy has helped, Sven.
I haven't been able to sleep this well in months.
and do you still believe you're surrounded by phonies?
sadly, yes. But thanks to you, I'm able to push past, to rediscover the quality and craft of my antique business, search for the meaning in my work.
sounds like Hayden isn't a half-bad therapist after all.
a lot of patients today? - Anybody weird? - Wall-to-wall mommy issues.
enough to make a man want to smoke.
or under-sleep or over-eat or
or?
who's the girl, Finch?
her name is Natalie Boal.
she works at an art gallery downtown.
she started coming to Hayden for therapy a little over a year ago.
it's more than therapy now.
Ugh, look at that. He isn't working her, he's in love.
and if she's making those eyes at him,
I bet she doesn't know about his criminal side.
someday, no more patients.
no more psychoses. No more snooty art buyers.
just you and me. We just go to the airport...
jet off to some corner of the world.
right. With what money, again?
let me worry about that.
and when I get enough, it's just you and me and paradise.
Hayden's on the move, Finch.
according to his schedule, he doesn't have any more appointments today.
so where is he going so fast?
there you go. - Thank you.
so, is everything in order? - Relax.
there's nothing to worry over.
the exchange rates are in your favor.
I started as a teller at that S&L, you know?
15 years I put in, and then they tell me I need to take a pay cut.
so I decided they owed me a pay raise.
here's my $50, 000, Mr. Russell.
Where's yours?
outstanding. Let's proceed.
I'm so gonna shoot this punk.
something's not right.
we're meeting your contact here?
it's quiet up here, and far from nosy thieves looking for cash.
no. The only thief here is you.
detective Decker, NYPD.
fraud investigation. Hands up, sucker.
sucker?
I can only guess what he got you for, pal.
and you, pass me that briefcase very slowly.
not today.
Oh, God.
Mr. Reese, Ms. Shaw, why aren't you intervening?
wait for it.
is he gone?
with his tail between his legs.
we really hooked that fish for 20 Gs? - Sure did.
20? I thought it was 50.
here's your half. Now let's get the hell out of here before somebody calls the real cops.
who isn't Hayden ripping off?
this guy's good.
I can watch you nursing that coffee for just so long.
you should know I called, to check in on you, Joss.
well, parking tickets and purse snatchers aren't exactly a challenge - after my old job, Mr. Quinn. - Alonzo, please.
the last time we met, you said you had suspicions about my godson's murder.
I tried working a few leads, but
Cal's department file was sealed.
there is a chance here that the organization HR could be involved.
I thought HR was disbanded. - The Feds just scattered the roaches.
it's sometimes hard to get 'em all.
maybe I can get the mayor involved, open doors for you at one pp.
I wouldn't wanna put you in that kind of position, Mr. Quinn.
I'll take my chances on this one solo.
all right.
I'm sorry, my shift is starting, and I have a rookie partner to pick up.
saddled you with a rookie, huh?
goes with the parking tickets and purse snatchers.
thanks for the coffee.
despite Hayden's criminality and his malfeasant theatrics,
I still think it's more likely that someone is out to get him than the other way around.
someone who bluejacked his phone.
maybe one of his clients is on to his scam.
Hayden may have conned any number of people, and all it takes is one easy mark with ties to a gang or organized crime, so we don't have a moment to waste.
if you and Ms. Shaw could visit some of his more irascible clients,
I'll text you their names and addresses on my way.
on your way to where? - Back to therapy.
Mr. Wren, when I snap my fingers, you will come totally out of your resting state feeling refreshed and relieved after our conversation.
so how did it go this time? - Quite well.
you're making very solid progress, Mr. Wren.
but sadly, our time is up for the day.
you really are very good at this, Mr. Price.
I'm so glad that I was referred to you. Where did you receive your training?
the Barringer Hypnosis Institute.
Oh, here in New York? - Of Tarzana, California.
I don't believe I know it.
what brought you all the way out here?
you know, I'm usually the one asking the questions, Mr. Wren.
who was it you said referred you to me again?
Oh, look at that. You're right.
our time is up for the day.
Hey, kid, come here.
Yes, sir.
Terney says you've been keeping an eye on Carter. - Yes, sir.
what does that mean?
well, we're having trouble with a money launderer.
guy messed up big. - But we need him to finish one morejob.
then you pull his card, dig a hole.
rest in peace.
who's the guy? The target?
come on, kid. We're taking a field trip.
and we're selling the soccer ball.
and I have your bid at $300, 000.
now 310, 000. 310, 000 right here.
320000
Hey, what are we doing here?
that's your guy.
his name is Sven.
he's an antique dealer down in the village.
we call him "the Swede."
so, what's your story? - You first.
I'm following an HR lead.
they wanna whack a Swedish antique dealer for screwing up their money laundering.
that's funny.
I'm on a con man therapist who happens to have a Swedish antique dealer as a patient.
I'll pretend that makes sense.
I think my con man might be after your Swede and his laundered money.
well, if that's HR's money, your con man is in for a world of hurt.
I'll stick with the con man, keep him out of trouble.
I'll stick with the antique dealer, see where he leads.
we are going once.
we are going twice.
fair warning on this 1911 Honus Wagner baseball card.
is sold, right here.
number 103 for $900, 000.
tomorrow, you're gonna punch that guy's ticket.
well, what do you know?
what's the Swede's therapist doing here?
Hey, Finch, we need to find out why everyone's so interested in the Swede.
so Hayden's patient is an antiques dealer, and he spent a million dollars on a baseball card?
and then tossed it into some cabinet like it was junk.
I watched him do it.
it's all very strange.
and what business does an antique dealer have laundering HR's money in the first place?
and why do they want him dead now?
turns out the Swede wasn't going to a real therapist.
he was spilling his guts to a con man.
I love that.
you know, that dinner was such a surprise.
I had a lovely time.
that's not the only surprise.
let's do it, Nat.
let's take our trip.
just go to the airport and pick our destination.
come with me?
Hayd, are you serious?
what about our-- our jobs, our lives?
they'll be here for us when we get back.
I wanna be impulsive.
I wanna whisk away the girl I love.
Yes. Of course.
when do we leave?
that's the other surprise.
now. No, tomorrow.
I need to do a few things.
pick you up in the AM?
I'll pack fast.
Finch, our con man's blowing the country fast.
something's up.
Oh, my God.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
who the hell are you?
the night watch.
who were these guys?
the cops-- the real cops.
what the hell is going on?
we were gonna ask you the same thing, Hayden.
I just spoke with Detective Carter.
she identified the badge numbers you gave me as HR. She's positive.
what's the deal, con man?
look. Someone just turned my office into Swiss cheese, and my girlfriend is waiting for me.
if she goes back to my place or to my office
I just spoke to Natalie a half an hour ago.
I explained to her how I was your new assistant and I needed to stash her in a motel until you'd visit her.
slight lie.
but nothing on a par with you, Hayden.
that's funny coming from you, Mr. Wren.
we know you've been scamming your patients, and we know you've had your eye especially on a Mr. Vanger, the antique dealer.
did you know he was a money launderer for HR?
I've heard of HR, but I swear, I didn't know the money was theirs.
who'd you think you were grifting?
sven came into my office a couple of months ago.
he was a chain smoker who had millions bouncing around in his accounts.
it would have been an easy score.
look what happened.
I didn't sign up for real bullets.
I'm done with this con and I'm out of here.
Where's Natalie? - Nice try. You're staying put.
what don't you get about "Done"?
look. You want me out of town?
I'm out of town.
but I can't go without her.
see, she's the only honest thing left about me.
I have to try and hold on to that.
detective, have you found out how the antique dealer is connected to HR's money laundering?
I'm meeting my source now.
you haven't touched your wine, Joss.
you're off duty. - I'm always on duty.
have you heard a word I said?
what do you think about the money being laundered?
I heard every word.
and the money's just HR's skim off the Russians.
a percentage kicked back to your friends in blue for turning a blind eye to the Yogorov business.
please, try the Brunello di Montalcino.
the finish is quite exquisite.
what I don't understand is what HR wants with an antique business.
clean money.
see, HR doesn't want blood-soaked bills from the Russians.
they want their cut in ones and zeroes, to transfer into their 401Ks, offshore accounts.
so, the antique dealer cycles the dirty Russian money into his own accounts and waits for instructions.
then he heads to the auction house, where he's told to bid on a certain high-priced item, an item auctioned off by a seller representing HR.
our next item up for bid is lot number 426
an extremely rare baseball signed by all of the 1927 New York Yankees, including Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth.
informally named,"Murderer's Row Ball."
I'd like to start the bidding at $2 million.
I got a bid for $2 million.
$4. 4 million. Where?
4. 4 in the front going once, twice.
sold right here,$4. 4 million. Thank you.
the Swede bids the highest, and all of that dirty money is deposited into HR's coffers, squeaky clean and laundered, and ready for digital distribution.
but I don't get it. They haven't laundered the money.
they've just bought an overpriced baseball.
all the items HR auctions off may have been appraised for millions of dollars, but they're really just fugazis, fakes, worthless junk.
so HR gets Russian money for nothing?
it's a perfect system, till someone on the outside knows about it.
so if your con man thinks he can just swoop in and take a piece of HR's business, he better watch his back.
who do you always meet in there? - None of your business.
Carter, I've been thinking.
that antique dealer, I can't just kill someone.
when I got involved with HR, I didn't think- No, you didn't think.
you just looked the other way.
I can't do that anymore.
and you're the only person I've got on my side right now. - I'm not on your side.
but I'm also not letting a homicide happen under my watch.
so, tomorrow, you're calling in sick.
I am? - Yeah, see you just got a new job.
tomorrow, you're Simmons's shadow.
wherever he goes, you go.
whoever he meets with, you get pictures of.
see, we just tapped into their piggy bank.
now I wanna know who's running the bank.
what is going on?
where have you been?
what-- Who is that creepy guy?
Natalie, I'm so sorry.
I get a call from someone at your office telling me to come to some hotel, - and then you don't even show up. - It's okay.
you need to take a breath. The more you breathe, the calmer you'll be. - No, no, no.
do not hypno-talk me.- I'm not hypno-talking you.
I'm saying, just be calm - I'm not one of your patients.
I know that, I know that.- You have to tell me
Finch, you ever notice how much of our job is like babysitting?
well, it's more than that today.
I don't think Hayden's told us the whole story of his con.
I'm going over Hayden's hard drive, what I downloaded of it before he zapped it.
and I'm finding emails addressed to Sven Vanger, the antique dealer.
Hayden may have elicited his email password while he was under hypnosis.
it appears that Hayden duplicated an email that Sven had received, but not yet read.
and he altered it in the process.
and what did the email say?
the email is from an anonymous address, regarding an auction that took place today.
in it, Vanger was instructed to bid on lot 424, but Hayden redrafted it, instructing him to bid on lot 426.
perhaps you should ask Hayden why.
he went out the window.
Finch, Hayden used his girlfriend and gave us all the slip.
I'm sorry. I'm about to close.
no, Sven, you're already closed.
who are you with, the Russians or the police?
I have nothing left for you. - I'm not with either.
but I do need something-- answers.
I'm not your doormat.
why don't you drop that before you hurt yourself, Sven?
give it to me.
why is it every time you call me these days, I know to bring a firearm?
but he was such a good therapist.
Hey, Dragon Tattoo, he's also a con man who stole from you.
not stealing from me, stealing from them.
he should not be doing that.
how'd you even get into this mess?
seven months ago, I got in trouble with the customs here in New York.
a cop named Simmons came and said he could make the charges go away if I helped them launder cash for a few Russian associates of theirs.
at first, it was just a few hundred thousand each month.
then it became more and more-- millions.
I got rid of the last cash today.
on lot 426?
how did you know about that? - Hayden played you.
he switched out your emails, and made you bid on the wrong item today.
then what did I purchase?
a real ball, signed by the real 1927 Yankees, really worth 4. 4 million.
that was a hell of a season.
Where's the ball, Sven?
it's gone. I sold it for $5.
they're going to kill me.
I gotta get out of this city immediately!
too late. You're a marked man.
close your eyes. This stuff burns.
so we're faking crime scenes now?
a long way from your days back at the Eighth.
might wanna spread it out.
arterial spray is more erratic. - Will you let me work?
going for a kind of a hollow-point special kind of motif.
there. - Congratulations.
you've just died and been reborn.
now, take your new life, and get the hell out of New York.
yeah? - Hey, rookie, I need you to hold off on the antique dealer.
something went wrong at the auction house. We didn't get our money.
sir, there's a small problem.
just heard from my source in HR,
Simmons knows they get ripped off.
all this baseball stuff, you should've called me in sooner.
I'm kind of a Mets fan, though.
somewhere in the city, your soda kid's walking around with a zillion-dollar baseball in his pocket.
with HR looking for the ball.
and the young man has no idea.
let's hope he don't play catch.
Hey, kiddo, you got something for me?
I can't believe Hayden would use his own girlfriend as an excuse to escape.
I can. A baseball worth 4 million would be a motivational force.
Oh, he doesn't care who he steps on to get away with it either.
exactly. He still has to get away, but he won't go without Natalie.
as you and I well know, sometimes necessity and desire can conflict.
Hayden's still in the city.
he's too smart to use his own phone.
so how do we track him?
we don't. We track Natalie.
Hayden's calling her right now.
Nat, please, I'm sorry.
I've done things that I'm not proud of, but I love you.
can you trust me on that? - I wanna know what's going on right now.
that's a little complicated, Nat.
wait. Where are you? - I'm going home.
did you think I was just gonna sit in that hotel room after you went out the window?
no, honey, you can't go there. It's not safe for you. - Really?
how would I even know?
look, Hayden, I love you.
but I deserve the truth, or else I'm done.
I'm a criminal and a thief.
but I'm done with that life.
I secured a score that will ensure our future.
the kind of score that would let us pick our destination.
if you meet me outside my old office in one hour, then we can fly to any corner of the world, like we planned.
and I'll tell you everything.
stop loving me or even hate me, but please hear me out.
I'll be there.
I didn't wanna worry you.
I'm cleanin' up this mess.
you say the Swede bought the baseball?
that's what the logs at the auction house said.
but without him, it's gonna be a little tough to track him.
that idiot bought a real autographed ballworth $4. 4 million, and we had a rookie kill him before we found out what he did with it?
maybe the rookie should be handling your end of things.
at least he follows through.
but you said there was a con man involved.
Yeah. - Find him.
shake him till the damn ball falls out.
and tell me you have at least one lead.
when we tapped his phone, we found out about the con man's little girlfriend.
it seems the guy's in love.
he ain't going anywhere without her.
make it right, Simmons.
I got two loves-- my money and this city.
mess with either, I mess right back.
Hey, lover boy.
What'd you expect? I'm a crook.
he's my expert.
what, you don't trust me? - Like you said, you're a crook.
I don't know about expert, but it looks pretty damn real.
I have a buyer lined up.
I'll split it with you, 50/50.
60/40? - Not a half bad deal, huh?
will you at least let me call Natalie before you kill me or arrest me or put me in a well in your basement?
you have 30 seconds.
sorry to disappoint, con man.
seems the NYPD isn't bad at phone traces.
I found your girl in 20 minutes.
I'll give you the ball. It's yours. - Don't be noble.
there's only criminals on this line.
but I'll take the ball, just the same.
you meet me in front of the auction house in 20 minutes.
how bad is it? - They'll kill her.
these people, for this much money?
so what are you gonna do to stop them?
I'm scum. I get it.
but Natalie
my ultimate con, my final trick was gonna be actually turning into the guy that she fell in love with.
I'll give it all away to save her life.
will you help me?
this is how it goes.
rookie stays outside with the girl.
Terney, take the con man inside, verify the ball is real.
I'm not taking any more chances with this clown.
why do I have to go inside?
because that's what you were just told.
once we confirm the ball is the real deal,
Laskey takes the girl, puts a double tap in her head.
questions?
boss, uh, she doesn't know anything.
why don't we just let her go?
do I look like I'm taking suggestions from rookies today?
no, sir.
the ball? - The girl.
I wanna talk to Natalie.
you're going inside first.
one thing you can trust about a thief is he'll always be a thief.
I'm so sorry.
call me when there's money and bodies.
you were right, Carter.
they would never let her go.
make it look good.
remember, the aim shouldn't be to hurt him, just incapacitate him a little.
also, watch your knuckles.
I've punched a lot of guys.
so have I.
let's get you to safety.
we've been through this already, it's real.
you think I'd be standing here if it wasn't?
we'll see.
I'll know in a minute.
I need a microscope to know for sure, but the texture appears accurate.
there is, however, a problem.
what?
see this? Babe Ruth's signature?
Yeah. What about it?
it's in felt-tip pen.
those didn't exist when Babe Ruth was alive.
this ball is a fake.
you give us a fake? You give us a fake?
you wanna die? - I swear, that is the real ball.
the real ball costs $4 million.
the fake is just gonna cost you a bullet, con man.
why would I lie?
you have to believe me.
we can figure this out.
where is the real ball?
so where's the real ball?
I have no idea. I thought this was the real ball.
forget that. Where's Natalie?
I put her in a cab, told her to go somewhere safe.
this is Natalie. - Nat, where are you?
are you okay?
Oh, I'm better than okay.
you see, that antique dealer
sven was his name-- well, he may have been your big score, but you were my big whale, from the moment I met you.
you-- you played me?
why steal millions from criminals when you can date the thief and take it off him?
keep the change.
of course, things did get a little hairy with those corrupt cops, but you always did know how to show a girl a good time, Hayden.
where will you go?
Oh, go find an airport, maybe just pick a destination.
isn't that the dream come true?
you know, I really did love you.
well, if you love something, set it free.
I'm ruined.
maybe it's time you went on the straight and narrow.
you'll live longer.
I hear hypnotherapists are in pretty high demand these days.
you know, I do have a thriving practice to rebuild.
I'm gonna need a new office with a few less bullet holes.
my advice?
rebuild in another city.
detective Terney, I can't help but notice you're not carrying a ball.
the ball the con man brought was a fake.
the guy with the suit showed up, rolled Laskey and our guys, and then got away with the con man and his girl.
do you have any idea what's at stake here?
you go find that screw-up Laskey and you scour this city until you find that ball.
Simmons, I'm not the rookie. Don't talk to me like one.
if you don't find that ball, then it's gonna be a $4 million funeral for the both of you.
now go.
I was just turning out the lights for the evening,
ms. Groves, and I remembered that I had promised to bring you some new reading material.
a peace offering, Harold?
is that what you've brought?
I really think if you could just see things my way, and not consider this- Imprisonment?
is there any other way to consider it?
this truly is for your own good, Ms. Groves.
this synchronistic relationship that you've developed with the machine, it can't be
I worry about you.
you've misunderstood the situation.
you shouldn't worry about me.
I'm worried about you, Harold.
you can't stop what's coming, and neither can I.
but we have the opportunity to understand things when they finally change.
the future is coming.
you started it...
and I'll finish it.
you missed me. Leave a message.
Laskey, I'm outside your place. We have a lot of work to do. Come on.
I stuck to the guy like glue.
this is everyone Simmons met with.
Thanks, kid, you did all right.
but you should know, it'll get harder out there.
after these last few days, things are gonna heat up.
so you need to be prepared.
Oh. When I got involved with HR,
I thought it was about loyalty.
I was wrong.
it's about murder and greed.
well, ain't that cozy.
I should've known she'd turn you, rookie.
the first time I saw you, I knew you were weak.
so let me tell you how the world works now, kid.
we kill her or they kill us.
that decision is gonna be your last, Terney.
No!
that much blood, and you'll be dead in a minute, maybe two.
make 'em count.
who do you and Simmons report to?
who calls the shots?
is the answer in these pictures, huh?
last chance, Terney! Be a cop!
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considers these people irrelevant.
we don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
you won't believe what the Swede has been doing
going to the therapy.
how much does the therapist know?
are you resting comfortably?
Yes. But I should tell you that, I don't really believe in hypnotism.
the act of hypnosis is freewill.
for me to proceed, your mind must grant the permission.
will it work on me the first time?
most of my clients experience results in three to five sessions.
so we'll work on your anxiety and paranoia gradually.
see, Mr. Wren, hypnosis is merely relaxation combined with imagery.
you experience it every night as you drift asleep, focus on a book, or miss your exit on the FDR.
ready? - I think so, yes.
then let's begin. Please pick up the tablet beside you, and choose an image that speaks to your emotion.
Oh, this one.
I want you to close your eyes and form a mental picture of that image.
picture the birds, the field.
then one by one, picture them as they fly away.
focus on your breathing.
one bird departs. And as each one goes, your relaxation increases and you continue to feel calmer and more at rest.
for 200 bucks an hour, Finch,
I hope you get more than an expensive nap.
I want to take you back to a place in your life where you were safe and comfortable.
can you think of that place, Mr. Wren?
my childhood bedroom.
now, I want you to think of all the ways it made you feel safe.
picture it clear as day.
what color were the walls?
Hayden Price-- certified hypnotherapist to the Upper East Side.
does he do birthday parties?
it's not that kind of hypnotism, Mr. Reese.
he caters to wealthy businessmen and socialites.
anger management, smoking cessation, that sort of of thing.
or so you might think, if you didn't know that the office was rented on a short-term lease, and that his certification doesn't come from any association I can find.
during the therapy, I became attuned to the kind of questions that Hayden was asking.
a color that's favorable to you-- blue.
the name of a childhood pet-- Scout.
he was fishing--getting answers to your security questions.
my bank account was suddenly signed up for a recurring automatic donation to the nonprofit called "The American Cancer Coalition Fund.
I'd be willing the wager that Hayden's name is on that nonprofit.
so, unless he's moonlighting as a samaritan,
I'd say we're dealing with a con artist and a very clever thief.
so why'd you even play along, Finch?
I told Hayden what he wanted to hear.
I didn't even have a pet as a child.
but when I went to bluejack his phone, it was blocked.
someone had already jacked it, perhaps someone who's out to get him.
and his clients would be the best place to start.
I'll contact Shaw for back-up, but first I need to look in on our houseguest.
as before, Ms. Groves, Mr. Reese is upstairs with an unhealthy number of firearms. Please don't try to run.
honestly, Harold, locking me up?
I admit that the accommodations are not ideal.
but your confinement is for your own good.
Harold, your machine called me.
an event that I haven't fully reasoned out.
but your unpredictability, your willingness to hurt others make you as dangerous as ever.
you can't fight the future.
I'll bring you some new books.
I get it.
you wonder why it won't talk to you like it talks to me.
don't be jealous, Harold.
mom still loves us both.
when bluejacking Hayden didn't work,
I sent him a basket of pastries as a thank you.
bugged, of course.
I'm just so angry with her, I could kill her.
and those feelings will dissipate as you feel calmer, Mr. Sykes.
tell me about your mother.
speak her name, out loud-- her full name.
Mary Shackford Sykes. - Very good.
that's a start.
it seems therapy has helped, Sven.
I haven't been able to sleep this well in months.
and do you still believe you're surrounded by phonies?
sadly, yes. But thanks to you, I'm able to push past, to rediscover the quality and craft of my antique business, search for the meaning in my work.
sounds like Hayden isn't a half-bad therapist after all.
a lot of patients today? - Anybody weird? - Wall-to-wall mommy issues.
enough to make a man want to smoke.
or under-sleep or over-eat or
or?
who's the girl, Finch?
her name is Natalie Boal.
she works at an art gallery downtown.
she started coming to Hayden for therapy a little over a year ago.
it's more than therapy now.
Ugh, look at that. He isn't working her, he's in love.
and if she's making those eyes at him,
I bet she doesn't know about his criminal side.
someday, no more patients.
no more psychoses. No more snooty art buyers.
just you and me. We just go to the airport...
jet off to some corner of the world.
right. With what money, again?
let me worry about that.
and when I get enough, it's just you and me and paradise.
Hayden's on the move, Finch.
according to his schedule, he doesn't have any more appointments today.
so where is he going so fast?
there you go. - Thank you.
so, is everything in order? - Relax.
there's nothing to worry over.
the exchange rates are in your favor.
I started as a teller at that S&L, you know?
15 years I put in, and then they tell me I need to take a pay cut.
so I decided they owed me a pay raise.
here's my $50, 000, Mr. Russell.
Where's yours?
outstanding. Let's proceed.
I'm so gonna shoot this punk.
something's not right.
we're meeting your contact here?
it's quiet up here, and far from nosy thieves looking for cash.
no. The only thief here is you.
detective Decker, NYPD.
fraud investigation. Hands up, sucker.
sucker?
I can only guess what he got you for, pal.
and you, pass me that briefcase very slowly.
not today.
Oh, God.
Mr. Reese, Ms. Shaw, why aren't you intervening?
wait for it.
is he gone?
with his tail between his legs.
we really hooked that fish for 20 Gs? - Sure did.
20? I thought it was 50.
here's your half. Now let's get the hell out of here before somebody calls the real cops.
who isn't Hayden ripping off?
this guy's good.
I can watch you nursing that coffee for just so long.
you should know I called, to check in on you, Joss.
well, parking tickets and purse snatchers aren't exactly a challenge - after my old job, Mr. Quinn. - Alonzo, please.
the last time we met, you said you had suspicions about my godson's murder.
I tried working a few leads, but
Cal's department file was sealed.
there is a chance here that the organization HR could be involved.
I thought HR was disbanded. - The Feds just scattered the roaches.
it's sometimes hard to get 'em all.
maybe I can get the mayor involved, open doors for you at one pp.
I wouldn't wanna put you in that kind of position, Mr. Quinn.
I'll take my chances on this one solo.
all right.
I'm sorry, my shift is starting, and I have a rookie partner to pick up.
saddled you with a rookie, huh?
goes with the parking tickets and purse snatchers.
thanks for the coffee.
despite Hayden's criminality and his malfeasant theatrics,
I still think it's more likely that someone is out to get him than the other way around.
someone who bluejacked his phone.
maybe one of his clients is on to his scam.
Hayden may have conned any number of people, and all it takes is one easy mark with ties to a gang or organized crime, so we don't have a moment to waste.
if you and Ms. Shaw could visit some of his more irascible clients,
I'll text you their names and addresses on my way.
on your way to where? - Back to therapy.
Mr. Wren, when I snap my fingers, you will come totally out of your resting state feeling refreshed and relieved after our conversation.
so how did it go this time? - Quite well.
you're making very solid progress, Mr. Wren.
but sadly, our time is up for the day.
you really are very good at this, Mr. Price.
I'm so glad that I was referred to you. Where did you receive your training?
the Barringer Hypnosis Institute.
Oh, here in New York? - Of Tarzana, California.
I don't believe I know it.
what brought you all the way out here?
you know, I'm usually the one asking the questions, Mr. Wren.
who was it you said referred you to me again?
Oh, look at that. You're right.
our time is up for the day.
Hey, kid, come here.
Yes, sir.
Terney says you've been keeping an eye on Carter. - Yes, sir.
what does that mean?
well, we're having trouble with a money launderer.
guy messed up big. - But we need him to finish one morejob.
then you pull his card, dig a hole.
rest in peace.
who's the guy? The target?
come on, kid. We're taking a field trip.
and we're selling the soccer ball.
and I have your bid at $300, 000.
now 310, 000. 310, 000 right here.
320000
Hey, what are we doing here?
that's your guy.
his name is Sven.
he's an antique dealer down in the village.
we call him "the Swede."
so, what's your story? - You first.
I'm following an HR lead.
they wanna whack a Swedish antique dealer for screwing up their money laundering.
that's funny.
I'm on a con man therapist who happens to have a Swedish antique dealer as a patient.
I'll pretend that makes sense.
I think my con man might be after your Swede and his laundered money.
well, if that's HR's money, your con man is in for a world of hurt.
I'll stick with the con man, keep him out of trouble.
I'll stick with the antique dealer, see where he leads.
we are going once.
we are going twice.
fair warning on this 1911 Honus Wagner baseball card.
is sold, right here.
number 103 for $900, 000.
tomorrow, you're gonna punch that guy's ticket.
well, what do you know?
what's the Swede's therapist doing here?
Hey, Finch, we need to find out why everyone's so interested in the Swede.
so Hayden's patient is an antiques dealer, and he spent a million dollars on a baseball card?
and then tossed it into some cabinet like it was junk.
I watched him do it.
it's all very strange.
and what business does an antique dealer have laundering HR's money in the first place?
and why do they want him dead now?
turns out the Swede wasn't going to a real therapist.
he was spilling his guts to a con man.
I love that.
you know, that dinner was such a surprise.
I had a lovely time.
that's not the only surprise.
let's do it, Nat.
let's take our trip.
just go to the airport and pick our destination.
come with me?
Hayd, are you serious?
what about our-- our jobs, our lives?
they'll be here for us when we get back.
I wanna be impulsive.
I wanna whisk away the girl I love.
Yes. Of course.
when do we leave?
that's the other surprise.
now. No, tomorrow.
I need to do a few things.
pick you up in the AM?
I'll pack fast.
Finch, our con man's blowing the country fast.
something's up.
Oh, my God.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
who the hell are you?
the night watch.
who were these guys?
the cops-- the real cops.
what the hell is going on?
we were gonna ask you the same thing, Hayden.
I just spoke with Detective Carter.
she identified the badge numbers you gave me as HR. She's positive.
what's the deal, con man?
look. Someone just turned my office into Swiss cheese, and my girlfriend is waiting for me.
if she goes back to my place or to my office
I just spoke to Natalie a half an hour ago.
I explained to her how I was your new assistant and I needed to stash her in a motel until you'd visit her.
slight lie.
but nothing on a par with you, Hayden.
that's funny coming from you, Mr. Wren.
we know you've been scamming your patients, and we know you've had your eye especially on a Mr. Vanger, the antique dealer.
did you know he was a money launderer for HR?
I've heard of HR, but I swear, I didn't know the money was theirs.
who'd you think you were grifting?
sven came into my office a couple of months ago.
he was a chain smoker who had millions bouncing around in his accounts.
it would have been an easy score.
look what happened.
I didn't sign up for real bullets.
I'm done with this con and I'm out of here.
Where's Natalie? - Nice try. You're staying put.
what don't you get about "Done"?
look. You want me out of town?
I'm out of town.
but I can't go without her.
see, she's the only honest thing left about me.
I have to try and hold on to that.
detective, have you found out how the antique dealer is connected to HR's money laundering?
I'm meeting my source now.
you haven't touched your wine, Joss.
you're off duty. - I'm always on duty.
have you heard a word I said?
what do you think about the money being laundered?
I heard every word.
and the money's just HR's skim off the Russians.
a percentage kicked back to your friends in blue for turning a blind eye to the Yogorov business.
please, try the Brunello di Montalcino.
the finish is quite exquisite.
what I don't understand is what HR wants with an antique business.
clean money.
see, HR doesn't want blood-soaked bills from the Russians.
they want their cut in ones and zeroes, to transfer into their 401Ks, offshore accounts.
so, the antique dealer cycles the dirty Russian money into his own accounts and waits for instructions.
then he heads to the auction house, where he's told to bid on a certain high-priced item, an item auctioned off by a seller representing HR.
our next item up for bid is lot number 426
an extremely rare baseball signed by all of the 1927 New York Yankees, including Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth.
informally named,"Murderer's Row Ball."
I'd like to start the bidding at $2 million.
I got a bid for $2 million.
$4. 4 million. Where?
4. 4 in the front going once, twice.
sold right here,$4. 4 million. Thank you.
the Swede bids the highest, and all of that dirty money is deposited into HR's coffers, squeaky clean and laundered, and ready for digital distribution.
but I don't get it. They haven't laundered the money.
they've just bought an overpriced baseball.
all the items HR auctions off may have been appraised for millions of dollars, but they're really just fugazis, fakes, worthless junk.
so HR gets Russian money for nothing?
it's a perfect system, till someone on the outside knows about it.
so if your con man thinks he can just swoop in and take a piece of HR's business, he better watch his back.
who do you always meet in there? - None of your business.
Carter, I've been thinking.
that antique dealer, I can't just kill someone.
when I got involved with HR, I didn't think- No, you didn't think.
you just looked the other way.
I can't do that anymore.
and you're the only person I've got on my side right now. - I'm not on your side.
but I'm also not letting a homicide happen under my watch.
so, tomorrow, you're calling in sick.
I am? - Yeah, see you just got a new job.
tomorrow, you're Simmons's shadow.
wherever he goes, you go.
whoever he meets with, you get pictures of.
see, we just tapped into their piggy bank.
now I wanna know who's running the bank.
what is going on?
where have you been?
what-- Who is that creepy guy?
Natalie, I'm so sorry.
I get a call from someone at your office telling me to come to some hotel, - and then you don't even show up. - It's okay.
you need to take a breath. The more you breathe, the calmer you'll be. - No, no, no.
do not hypno-talk me.- I'm not hypno-talking you.
I'm saying, just be calm - I'm not one of your patients.
I know that, I know that.- You have to tell me
Finch, you ever notice how much of our job is like babysitting?
well, it's more than that today.
I don't think Hayden's told us the whole story of his con.
I'm going over Hayden's hard drive, what I downloaded of it before he zapped it.
and I'm finding emails addressed to Sven Vanger, the antique dealer.
Hayden may have elicited his email password while he was under hypnosis.
it appears that Hayden duplicated an email that Sven had received, but not yet read.
and he altered it in the process.
and what did the email say?
the email is from an anonymous address, regarding an auction that took place today.
in it, Vanger was instructed to bid on lot 424, but Hayden redrafted it, instructing him to bid on lot 426.
perhaps you should ask Hayden why.
he went out the window.
Finch, Hayden used his girlfriend and gave us all the slip.
I'm sorry. I'm about to close.
no, Sven, you're already closed.
who are you with, the Russians or the police?
I have nothing left for you. - I'm not with either.
but I do need something-- answers.
I'm not your doormat.
why don't you drop that before you hurt yourself, Sven?
give it to me.
why is it every time you call me these days, I know to bring a firearm?
but he was such a good therapist.
Hey, Dragon Tattoo, he's also a con man who stole from you.
not stealing from me, stealing from them.
he should not be doing that.
how'd you even get into this mess?
seven months ago, I got in trouble with the customs here in New York.
a cop named Simmons came and said he could make the charges go away if I helped them launder cash for a few Russian associates of theirs.
at first, it was just a few hundred thousand each month.
then it became more and more-- millions.
I got rid of the last cash today.
on lot 426?
how did you know about that? - Hayden played you.
he switched out your emails, and made you bid on the wrong item today.
then what did I purchase?
a real ball, signed by the real 1927 Yankees, really worth 4. 4 million.
that was a hell of a season.
Where's the ball, Sven?
it's gone. I sold it for $5.
they're going to kill me.
I gotta get out of this city immediately!
too late. You're a marked man.
close your eyes. This stuff burns.
so we're faking crime scenes now?
a long way from your days back at the Eighth.
might wanna spread it out.
arterial spray is more erratic. - Will you let me work?
going for a kind of a hollow-point special kind of motif.
there. - Congratulations.
you've just died and been reborn.
now, take your new life, and get the hell out of New York.
yeah? - Hey, rookie, I need you to hold off on the antique dealer.
something went wrong at the auction house. We didn't get our money.
sir, there's a small problem.
just heard from my source in HR,
Simmons knows they get ripped off.
all this baseball stuff, you should've called me in sooner.
I'm kind of a Mets fan, though.
somewhere in the city, your soda kid's walking around with a zillion-dollar baseball in his pocket.
with HR looking for the ball.
and the young man has no idea.
let's hope he don't play catch.
Hey, kiddo, you got something for me?
I can't believe Hayden would use his own girlfriend as an excuse to escape.
I can. A baseball worth 4 million would be a motivational force.
Oh, he doesn't care who he steps on to get away with it either.
exactly. He still has to get away, but he won't go without Natalie.
as you and I well know, sometimes necessity and desire can conflict.
Hayden's still in the city.
he's too smart to use his own phone.
so how do we track him?
we don't. We track Natalie.
Hayden's calling her right now.
Nat, please, I'm sorry.
I've done things that I'm not proud of, but I love you.
can you trust me on that? - I wanna know what's going on right now.
that's a little complicated, Nat.
wait. Where are you? - I'm going home.
did you think I was just gonna sit in that hotel room after you went out the window?
no, honey, you can't go there. It's not safe for you. - Really?
how would I even know?
look, Hayden, I love you.
but I deserve the truth, or else I'm done.
I'm a criminal and a thief.
but I'm done with that life.
I secured a score that will ensure our future.
the kind of score that would let us pick our destination.
if you meet me outside my old office in one hour, then we can fly to any corner of the world, like we planned.
and I'll tell you everything.
stop loving me or even hate me, but please hear me out.
I'll be there.
I didn't wanna worry you.
I'm cleanin' up this mess.
you say the Swede bought the baseball?
that's what the logs at the auction house said.
but without him, it's gonna be a little tough to track him.
that idiot bought a real autographed ballworth $4. 4 million, and we had a rookie kill him before we found out what he did with it?
maybe the rookie should be handling your end of things.
at least he follows through.
but you said there was a con man involved.
Yeah. - Find him.
shake him till the damn ball falls out.
and tell me you have at least one lead.
when we tapped his phone, we found out about the con man's little girlfriend.
it seems the guy's in love.
he ain't going anywhere without her.
make it right, Simmons.
I got two loves-- my money and this city.
mess with either, I mess right back.
Hey, lover boy.
What'd you expect? I'm a crook.
he's my expert.
what, you don't trust me? - Like you said, you're a crook.
I don't know about expert, but it looks pretty damn real.
I have a buyer lined up.
I'll split it with you, 50/50.
60/40? - Not a half bad deal, huh?
will you at least let me call Natalie before you kill me or arrest me or put me in a well in your basement?
you have 30 seconds.
sorry to disappoint, con man.
seems the NYPD isn't bad at phone traces.
I found your girl in 20 minutes.
I'll give you the ball. It's yours. - Don't be noble.
there's only criminals on this line.
but I'll take the ball, just the same.
you meet me in front of the auction house in 20 minutes.
how bad is it? - They'll kill her.
these people, for this much money?
so what are you gonna do to stop them?
I'm scum. I get it.
but Natalie
my ultimate con, my final trick was gonna be actually turning into the guy that she fell in love with.
I'll give it all away to save her life.
will you help me?
this is how it goes.
rookie stays outside with the girl.
Terney, take the con man inside, verify the ball is real.
I'm not taking any more chances with this clown.
why do I have to go inside?
because that's what you were just told.
once we confirm the ball is the real deal,
Laskey takes the girl, puts a double tap in her head.
questions?
boss, uh, she doesn't know anything.
why don't we just let her go?
do I look like I'm taking suggestions from rookies today?
no, sir.
the ball? - The girl.
I wanna talk to Natalie.
you're going inside first.
one thing you can trust about a thief is he'll always be a thief.
I'm so sorry.
call me when there's money and bodies.
you were right, Carter.
they would never let her go.
make it look good.
remember, the aim shouldn't be to hurt him, just incapacitate him a little.
also, watch your knuckles.
I've punched a lot of guys.
so have I.
let's get you to safety.
we've been through this already, it's real.
you think I'd be standing here if it wasn't?
we'll see.
I'll know in a minute.
I need a microscope to know for sure, but the texture appears accurate.
there is, however, a problem.
what?
see this? Babe Ruth's signature?
Yeah. What about it?
it's in felt-tip pen.
those didn't exist when Babe Ruth was alive.
this ball is a fake.
you give us a fake? You give us a fake?
you wanna die? - I swear, that is the real ball.
the real ball costs $4 million.
the fake is just gonna cost you a bullet, con man.
why would I lie?
you have to believe me.
we can figure this out.
where is the real ball?
so where's the real ball?
I have no idea. I thought this was the real ball.
forget that. Where's Natalie?
I put her in a cab, told her to go somewhere safe.
this is Natalie. - Nat, where are you?
are you okay?
Oh, I'm better than okay.
you see, that antique dealer
sven was his name-- well, he may have been your big score, but you were my big whale, from the moment I met you.
you-- you played me?
why steal millions from criminals when you can date the thief and take it off him?
keep the change.
of course, things did get a little hairy with those corrupt cops, but you always did know how to show a girl a good time, Hayden.
where will you go?
Oh, go find an airport, maybe just pick a destination.
isn't that the dream come true?
you know, I really did love you.
well, if you love something, set it free.
I'm ruined.
maybe it's time you went on the straight and narrow.
you'll live longer.
I hear hypnotherapists are in pretty high demand these days.
you know, I do have a thriving practice to rebuild.
I'm gonna need a new office with a few less bullet holes.
my advice?
rebuild in another city.
detective Terney, I can't help but notice you're not carrying a ball.
the ball the con man brought was a fake.
the guy with the suit showed up, rolled Laskey and our guys, and then got away with the con man and his girl.
do you have any idea what's at stake here?
you go find that screw-up Laskey and you scour this city until you find that ball.
Simmons, I'm not the rookie. Don't talk to me like one.
if you don't find that ball, then it's gonna be a $4 million funeral for the both of you.
now go.
I was just turning out the lights for the evening,
ms. Groves, and I remembered that I had promised to bring you some new reading material.
a peace offering, Harold?
is that what you've brought?
I really think if you could just see things my way, and not consider this- Imprisonment?
is there any other way to consider it?
this truly is for your own good, Ms. Groves.
this synchronistic relationship that you've developed with the machine, it can't be
I worry about you.
you've misunderstood the situation.
you shouldn't worry about me.
I'm worried about you, Harold.
you can't stop what's coming, and neither can I.
but we have the opportunity to understand things when they finally change.
the future is coming.
you started it...
and I'll finish it.
you missed me. Leave a message.
Laskey, I'm outside your place. We have a lot of work to do. Come on.
I stuck to the guy like glue.
this is everyone Simmons met with.
Thanks, kid, you did all right.
but you should know, it'll get harder out there.
after these last few days, things are gonna heat up.
so you need to be prepared.
Oh. When I got involved with HR,
I thought it was about loyalty.
I was wrong.
it's about murder and greed.
well, ain't that cozy.
I should've known she'd turn you, rookie.
the first time I saw you, I knew you were weak.
so let me tell you how the world works now, kid.
we kill her or they kill us.
that decision is gonna be your last, Terney.
No!
that much blood, and you'll be dead in a minute, maybe two.
make 'em count.
who do you and Simmons report to?
who calls the shots?
is the answer in these pictures, huh?
last chance, Terney! Be a cop!
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considers these people irrelevant.
we don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
the politicians come and go, but we'll be here forever.
Beecher's looking for answers.
I always told Cal to be careful. Being a cop's a dangerous job.
hr rebuilt itself from ashes, 'cause we didn't cut off the head.
if we had, Cal might still be alive.
I'm playing by different rules now, until I can bring down the boss.
who do you and Simmons report to?
who calls the shots?
those bastards think they can steal from me?
then they're gonna reap what they sow.
Finch, you doing a little spring cleaning?
I wish I was.
I received numbers this morning.
38 of them, to be precise.
maybe the machine blew a belt or something.
it's not a lawn mower, Mr. Reese.
it's also never wrong.
while I haven't decoded all the numbers, there does appear to be a common thread.
they're all cops.
four of them are known members of HR, leaving a high probability that the rest may be as well.
3 dozen members of HR, all about to commit a violent crime?
or they've been targeted, and HR is under siege.
things are about to get chaotic, Mr. Reese.
I've already contacted Ms. Shaw to enlist her assistance.
I'll see if Fusco's heard any rumblings around the Eighth of an HR conflict.
if we could locate the source of the threat, perhaps we could defuse the situation before it escalates.
perhaps.
meantime, you might want to get Bear here fitted for a vest.
vest? - Not like yours, Finch. K-9 ballistic.
for when things get chaotic.
heard anything, Lionel?
if you're looking for info on HR, I got something you wanna see.
everything okay here? Detective Fusco.
I'm Detective Stills. Can we be of any assistance?
not unless you speak Russian.
best I can tell, he was driving along, and he came upon a burning car.
then-- if I got this right-- someone knocked him out and stole his truck.
my friend. What kind of truck were you driving?
office supply truck? A delivery truck?
I think you can take it from here, Officer.
nice badge. You wanna give me a warning next time you do something like that?
but that would ruin the surprise.
so what does all this have to do with HR?
know who has an office supply company?
Peter Yogorov. He uses it to smuggle drugs into the city.
under the HR alliance, the cops are supposed to provide safe passage.
now you wanted to know why HR might be in trouble?
how about the Russians losing a truck full of contraband on their watch?
think you can get us a look at that camera feed?
Yeah, I love using all my favors for you guys.
what do you think, Finch?
I'm inclined to agree with Detective Fusco.
so Yogorov blames HR for his missing shipment.
decides to sever ties.
and targets 38 members of HR's rank.
this situation is a powder keg, Mr. Reese.
it's about to explode.
so who lit the fuse?
whole department's reeling.
not too sure of how many more funerals the NYPD can endure.
do you have any idea what happened between Detective Terney and Officer Laskey?
I wasn't aware of any conflict. Didn't even know they knew each other.
well, there's some speculation that it's HR-related.
mayor's concerned about a resurgence in organized crime.
last time we talked, you seemed to indicate that HR might have been behind my godson's murder.
maybe.
I-I don't know.
all I know is taking on HR...
it's like fighting a battle that can't be won.
one step forward, three steps back.
and now, losing my partner...
I need to close the book on Cal's murder.
I have to move on.
I wanted to tell you that in person.
you're one of the most dedicated cops I know, and the city could use more like you.
Cal would be very proud of everything you did.
and don't worry.
we will find who's responsible for his death.
Thanks, Alonzo. - Anytime.
I've got a big briefing with the Mayor.
I'll take care of this.
I'll see you soon.
I look forward to it.
spoke to Carter this morning.
says she's stepping down on the Beecher case.
you believe her?
even if I did, we can't have any more bodies dropping right now.
keep an eye on her just in case. - Will do.
did Yogorov accept our new terms? - Not yet.
he wants to meet at a grain depot in Red Hook.
meet him in Siberia if he wants. Just get him to agree to the new price.
who's the new guy?
this is Mitchell.
he'll be running point on tomorrow night's shipment.
so we still on schedule?
just in time to restock the shelves.
my guy will call you when he hits Laurel Hill.
we'll escort the trucks, provide safe passage through town.
but it's gonna cost an extra 10%. - Why?
cost of doing business.
if I'm going to pay more, I ought to get more. Don't you think? - Like what?
my brother's still in Rikers, for one. You were supposed to get us both out.
well, these things take time. It's in progress.
I'm starting to feel less like your partner and more like your errand boy.
we launder your money, sell your drugs, even take out your trash.
like that narco cop you were too afraid to knock off.
I didn't come to hear you bitch, Yogorov.
you kicking in the extra 10% or what?
I don't think so.
you don't pay, we don't provide safe passage for the drugs.
anything happens, it's on you.
I'll take my chances.
what do you wanna do?
let me worry about that.
I need you on a new assignment.
tell me you didn't use the front door.
I never do.
Where's Taylor?
somewhere safe.
any reason he wouldn't be safe here?
like your off-the-books pursuit of HR?
everyone needs a hobby.
most hobbies don't involve dirty cops staked outside your apartment.
if you want, I can take care of him for you.
I'd appreciate it if you left him alone.
respectfully, I'd appreciate it if you left me alone for a while too.
now's not the time to fly solo, Carter. - Don't get me wrong, John.
I appreciate everything you've done for me and the city.
but in the eyes of the law, you're still a criminal.
and HR already knows we work together.
and if they could prove it...
no, I'm sorry.
I gotta finish this alone. - All right.
do what you need to do.
but HR won't go down without a fight.
if you get in over your head, give me a call.
with the way you guys keep tabs on me, how much trouble can I get in?
watch your back, Joss.
read your file, Carter.
top of your class at the academy, high marks across the board-- that's great.
now, throw it all out.
none of it's worth a damn out here on the street.
excuse me for one second. I'll be right back.
sup, Joss?
what are you doing here, Paul?
just got back into town.
friend hooked me up with a construction crew.
I see you traded in one uniform for another.
guess you, uh, always had a thing for hunting bad guys.
none of that answers my question.
wanted to see how you were getting along, you know?
see how our son was doing.
you think you can just show up after two years and ask to see Taylor?
look, Joss, things are better now, okay? I'm better.
so that means you went to the VA? - The VA?
Nah, I don't need some head shrinker analyzing me. All right, Joss?
I just needed some time to just clear my head.
it's not that simple, Paul.
I saw the toll combat took on you. - You still think I'm a danger, don't you?
Joss, I never laid a hand on either one of y'all. - No!
I'd just find you asleep on the kitchen floor - cradling a gun, with our son in the next room. - Well, that's not gonna happen again.
you're right. It won't.
because if you don't get help, you'll never have a relationship with your son.
and until then,
I think it's best you stay away from both of us.
I got your messages, Fusco.
all ten of 'em.
I heard what happened to Laskey.
how you holding up?
it's never an easy thing, losing a partner.
kinda makes you wonder what really went down between those two that night.
not sure I wanna know.
you know what I think?
I think someone else was there.
I think someone shot them both and staged the scene.
the only question is, who?
I don't know, Fusco.
but whatever happened, I don't want any part of it.
Terney was the one who told you HR had your boyfriend killed.
now he's dead along with your rookie partner?
I mean, don't you wanna know why? - Something I realized...
it's not always worth the risk to know why.
I guess not.
it'll be all right, Fusco.
just lay low for a while. - Yeah.
Hey, listen, I gotta get back.
don't stay a stranger, all right?
Hey, it's me. I need you to pay someone a visit.
just got word.
our shipment's crossed state lines. So far, no signs of trouble.
makes me wonder why we ever needed cops for this in the first place.
what the hell?
you know what crime you're most guilty of, Peter?
letting this man cook for you.
those look heavy.
relax. If I wanted you dead, I'd be a little more creative than this.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
figured you be on a beach somewhere, sipping mai tais and licking your wounds.
I just can't leave yet.
not with front-row seats to this little drama playing out between you and HR.
I don't know what you're talking about.
the wheels of history are turning again, Peter. Take my word for it.
if the cops can't control you, they'll betray you. Just like they did me.
but unlike me, you still have a chance to do something about this.
words of wisdom from the man who killed my father.
tell me why I should listen to you.
enemy of my enemy.
I just can't pass up a chance to watch HR suffer.
what's this? - A gift.
let that simmer for 15 minutes, then stir with vinegar.
well?
Yogorov got the package. Whether he received the message is another story.
he'll understand soon enough.
save everyone a lot of trouble if you'd let me kill him.
that won't be necessary.
in fact, you might want to keep a low profile for the next couple days.
already planning on it.
and whatever you're up to, officer, I wish you the best of luck.
I have a feeling you're gonna need it.
who was on the phone?
someone who owes me a favor.
it's all there?
everything but the kitchen sink. Tried it, didn't fit.
I appreciate you not telling the guys about this.
boys can't have all the toys.
you're fixing to have quite a party with all this stuff.
you sure you don't need an assist?
the 37 mil can be tricky.
Thanks.
but I can take it from here.
honestly, Mr. Reese, this looks like something you would do.
gotta admit, I wish I was invited.
after digging into 30 out of the 38 HR numbers, not a single man possesses the talents displayed in that footage.
I'm not so sure it was a man.
come take a look at this.
height, build--I think our assailant might be a woman.
a woman sets a car on fire and attacks a drug shipment wearing a gas mask?
who does that remind you of, Mr. Reese?
what are you guys looking at?
all right, you're being weird.
this your handiwork?
I guess she does know her way around a 37 mil.
ms. Shaw, you know something about this?
I know someone needed firepower. Reese had plenty, so I made a donation on his behalf.
wait. That's my grenade launcher?
Oh, my God, that's Detective Carter, isn't it?
your social circle isn't terribly wide.
she told me she didn't want you guys involved.
because we would have tried to talk her out of it.
until now, her investigation into HR has fallen on the legal side of things. But this...
pitting them against the Russians?
you two get eyes on every one of those numbers.
and how exactly can we be 40 places at once?
I don't care.
if they find out Carter's behind this, only one number's coming up-- hers.
yes?
good morning, Alonzo.
how did you get this number?
found it.
on the burner phone your man dropped when he made off with my supply truck last night.
I was sorry to hear about what happened to your shipment, but I'm not exactly sure what you're implying.
you ripped me off, old man.
taking your toys and going home.
except they weren't your toys to take.
I'm going to pretend you're having a momentary lapse in judgment.
you got robbed, and now you're not thinking straight.
well, then let me be extra clear right now.
I'm looking at names and pictures of top-level HR members.
return my drugs, or your men don't make it home for dinner.
Finch, I haven't found Carter, but I think I know who the head of HR is.
and I believe I know as well.
I just decoded the last number.
makes sense.
the Mayor's Chief of Staff would be in a prime position to lead HR from the shadows.
he's also the man who ordered Beecher's death.
this is more personal for Carter than we thought.
then you'd better do everything in your power to find her.
I see you're looking for me. - Joss?
where are you? - I can't tell you that.
but I know exactly where you are.
thought you promised to keep your distance.
that was before I knew you were starting a war.
we know about Quinn and what he did to Cal.
then you know why he can't get away with it.
take it from me.
revenge isn't the answer.
tell me where you are. Please just let me help you.
you once asked me to trust you to do what needed to be done.
now I'm asking the same of you.
talk to me. - No one knows who hit the Russian truck.
video footage from the RTCC is conveniently missing.
this has "man in the suit" written all over it.
frankly, I don't care who stole Yogorov's cargo.
if he's considering an end to our alliance, he's a major liability.
he's threatening our people.
I'd say the alliance is finished.
Peter Yogorov doesn't have the stones to come after us.
boss, what the hell just happened?
someone just took a shot at me in my office.
Yogorov. - He wants to bite the hand that feeds, he can starve.
round up his top ranks and take them on out to Red Hook.
kill 'em and bury 'em.
but bring Yogorov to me.
I'll deal with that son of a bitch myself.
while you were looking for Detective Carter, I received more numbers.
it appears that HR has responded to the Russian threat in kind.
guess it was only a matter of time until this escalated into an all-out war.
if you'll forgive my gallows humor, I'll put my money on HR.
why do you say that?
because they have something on their sid that the Russians don't, Mr. Reese.
the law.
grab Yogorov's men. Keep it quiet.
no blood on the streets.
hands where I can see them.
get out of the car.
Nikolai, where the hell are you?
watch your back. HR's moving against us.
first five guys through that door get early retirement!
that come with a pension?
I remember you. - Good, we can skip the introduction.
hr already rounded up all your boys.
you're the last little Indian.
and right now, they're on their way here to kill you.
so if you wanna live, you're coming with me.
last time I went with you, you arrested me.
guess old habits die hard.
you okay? - We're great.
aren't we, little man, hmm?
I'm sorry. He just showed up.
it's all right, thanks for calling.
Paul, can I talk to you outside?
why not here?
I mean, the boy's old enough to hear what you have to say.
take my son into his room.
sure. Come on, Taylor.
the hell are you doing, besides giving me a good reason to lock you up?
look, Joss.
a boy needs a father in his life.
a father who's willing to admit when he needs help.
you know what?
you didn't see combat like I did.
you spent your time back on a base, chatting up terrorists.
and then when you came home, you were fine.
you think it was that easy for me?
I had problems too.
but I found ways to handle them.
look, just because I did it by myself doesn't mean you have to.
okay, so let me guess.
I should go... talk to the VA, right?
I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
that's right, because you run from your problems.
I'm not running!
you gonna shoot me now, Joss?
get out of my house.
thank you. - Yeah.
I'm sorry you had to hear that. - What's wrong with daddy?
sometimes he gets mad.
and he doesn't know why.
will he get better?
I don't know, baby.
but hey...
as long as we got each other, you and I are gonna be fine.
okay?
come here.
this your idea of protection?
a sheriff station in Bedford?
I booked you as a DUI under the name Joe Manco.
should keep you alive for a few hours, at least.
the best I could do for the guy who took a shot at the head of HR.
I didn't take a shot at anyone.
thing about dirty cops, Peter...
they're not big on evidence.
do you recognize this man?
that cop got shot a few months back.
his name's Cal Beecher.
he was Alonzo Quinn's godson.
remind me to send flowers.
Peter, I know Quinn's the head of HR.
and I know he ordered your men to carry out the hit on Beecher.
even if that were true...
never be able to prove it. - Maybe not.
but then again...
I've been following HR and the Russians for months.
I've gathered enough evidence to put almost everybody away.
including you.
so then why are we talking? - Because it's your lucky day.
I want Quinn's head more than I want yours.
sorry.
I'd rather rot in prison than be labeled a rat.
every room I go in, I always look for the exits.
I was a soldier. Can't turn it off.
so trust me when I tell you you only have one way out of this.
and that's Quinn going down.
he stays out there, doesn't matter who else I arrest, he'll be coming for you eventually.
I can take care of myself. - I respect that. I really do.
but can you say the same for your brother?
you ever wonder why HR's kept him in Rikers?
leverage.
there are about half a dozen corrupt cops awaiting trial on the same cell block as your brother right now.
you sign this statement...
I could get Laszlo moved to safer facilities within the next few hours.
so what's it gonna be?
just show me the damn statement.
now what? - I get an arrest warrant for Quinn.
you sure you got a judge you can trust with that?
Quinn liked to spread that money around.
we made him a lot of it.
spent the last few days vetting judges.
narrowed it down to a couple.
my statement, the evidence you got, and this whole thing comes down to blind luck.
do me a favor, officer.
choose wisely.
because if you don't, then you, me, and my brother...are all dead.
scared me half to death, Carter. - I'm sorry.
can't take any chances.
Yeah, Wonder Boy told me what you're up to.
this your idea of laying low? - I had to make a bit of a mess.
that's why I needed to see you. - Yeah?
I'm not sure why.
I couldn't figure out at first why you didn't read me into this thing.
why you cut me out.
then I realized you still don't trust me. I get it.
I guess there's a certain stink you really can't wash off.
that's not it, Fusco.
but I know how hard it was for you to get out from underneath HR.
anything goes wrong, you're the first guy they're gonna come for.
I was trying to protect you.
protect me? By keeping me in the dark?
I thought we were partners. - We are. That's why I'm here now.
what's this?
it's to a safety deposit box at the one state bank in Hoboken.
inside is everything I collected on HR.
recordings, money trails, everything.
I'm about to get an arrest warrant for Quinn.
then what? - Then I'm gonna arrest him.
but if anything happens...
I need you to hold on to that. - No.
no what?
no way you're gonna come here with this "If anything happens to me" crap.
Lionel, you're the only person in the world I trust with this.
Plus...you're the best partner I ever had.
if you think I'm gonna let you take down Quinn by yourself after coming here and saying something like that, you got another thing coming.
okay.
we'll take your car, but I'm driving.
Oh, you might want to get your vest.
let me grab it. - You know what?
grab your 12-gauge too. - All right.
sorry, Fusco.
but I gotta do this one alone.
all this could have been avoided if your boss hadn't tried to kill mine.
Carter's so determined to get Quinn, she's forgotten about collateral damage.
you ready, Shaw?
one question-- once we save the bad Russians from the bad cops, what exactly are we gonna do with them?
let's finish this.
FBI! Who's in charge here?
detective Stan Mitchell. We got a tip the Russians were making a deal out here.
we came to bust it up.
Carter. - You know, we got a tip as well.
bunch of corrupt cops were gonna kill some Russians over a pile of missing drugs.
mind if we look in your trunk?
hope you got a good lawyer, Detective.
guess our work here is done.
did you find her, Lionel?
she found me. But she, uh - Let me guess.
she ditched you.
she's going alone on this one. She doesn't want any help.
they'll kill her if they figure out what she's up to, John.
we'd better find her then.
let's split up. Spread out in case Finch comes up with her location.
hello. - Judge Monahan? It's Joss Carter.
I apologize for calling so late, but I was hoping you could grant me an arrest warrant tonight.
it can't be done in the morning? - I'm afraid not.
I have a sworn statement implicating a prominent member of city hall in a major crime and corruption ring.
have you spoken to the DA about this?
I will, first thing in the morning.
but right now, I need the warrant. - I understand.
get here as soon as you can.
sir, this is Judge Andrew Monahan.
I'm sorry to bother you at home.
I just received a call you might want to be aware of.
do you know a police officer by the name of Joss Carter?
you were right to contact me.
tell me everything she told you.
no uniform. You made detective.
what you need, Paul?
I didn't come here to ask you for anything.
I just...just wanted to show you this.
good for you.
you look better. - I am.
I mean, not all the way, but some.
the counseling's kicking my ass.
lot of stuff I didn't wanna relive--things I did, people I hurt. - Yeah, uh, Paul, I
no, no, no. I know. There's no going back. I see that now.
but they keep telling me I have to find a way forward, a purpose.
that's what I'm working on now. I just wanted you to know that.
if there's ever anything I can do for Taylor, for both of you, here's my number.
thanks for hearing me out, Joss.
all right.
Hello? - Paul, it's me.
Oh, hey, Joss. Let me get him for you.
actually, I needed to tell you something.
what's up?
Thanks. For taking care of him.
it's good he can rely on you.
that's how it's supposed to be, Joss.
that's how it always should have been. All right?
hold on, somebody wants to talk to you.
Hey, mom. - Hey, baby.
how's it going over there?
good. Dad tried to make a casserole.
we ended up ordering pizza.
y'all are hopeless.
you okay? - Yeah! Fine.
just driving and, uh...
I wanted to say I'm sorry. - For what?
to me...you're still my little dude, you know?
sometimes I-I forget you're practically all grown up.
these last eight months, I've been secretive, keeping you in the dark.
you're protecting me. I get it.
but whatever you're doing, you know you don't have to do it alone, right?
you got my back, don't you? - Always. And not just me.
lots of people care about you.
if you ever need any help, all you have to do is ask.
you know that, right?
I love you, baby boy. I'll call you tomorrow.
I love you too, mom. - Okay.
judge Monahan, thank you so much for
let's get this over with, shall we? - Absolutely.
I wouldn't be here this late if it wasn't important, Your Honor.
see, this warrant is the key to our
he wasn't talking about the warrant, Joss.
heard you were looking for me.
figured I'd save you the trouble.
you know, I think that's your problem.
you see yourself as a protagonist in some great tragedy.
determined to face the world alone.
even if it gets you killed.
"to be or not to be," bitch. Move.
for what it's worth, I had hoped that we could have avoided this day.
at least have the balls to pull the trigger yourself.
don't outsource me like you did your own godson.
I don't relish what happened to him, but sometimes sacrifices are necessary for the greater good.
my mistake was not having you killed along with Cal.
then neither of you would have had to die alone.
you were right. I was wrong.
I thought I could take you down alone.
always did have trust issues.
tried to do it clean.
photos, recordings, sworn testimony.
but then I realized you're just too dirty.
everywhere I turned, you had friends ready to help you out.
and I was alone.
so...I called some friends of my own.
you get all that, fellas?
she's not wired. - It's a brave new world, boys.
don't you read the papers?
anyone can listen in on your phone.
even when it's turned off.
my mistake was not having you killed along with Cal.
then neither of you would have had to die alone.
now, Mr. Reese. - Everybody, down!
get your ass up here, now!
thanks for the help. - Thanks for the call.
where are we taking him? - Fed building downtown.
the FBI may be the only ones we can trust.
lot of dirty cops between here and there.
this will be the last mistake you ever make.
NYPD! Get your hands on your
where the hell are they? - Gone.
it's dead. He shot out the engine.
he didn't shoot your camera.
get this out on the wire.
our people only.
not just the ones in blue.
I want every criminal outfit on the street to have this picture.
the man in the suit dies tonight.
time's up. Told you I'd end you.
not today!
Finch, we've got a problem.
Reese has really gone off the reservation this time.
we're out of options. We need Root.
I know this is our only option, Ms. Shaw.
I just want to make sure we're prepared for what may happen.
Mr. Reese, we save lives.
you save lives.
not all of them.
ms. Shaw.
we have a new number yet?
no, not at this time.
it's been a while.
guess the city's scumbags have been behaving.
we could use a little quiet.
I don't do quiet.
that's why I took this job, and the one before that.
not sure I appreciate being associated with your former employers, who tried to kill you.
it's not like this job's any safer.
speaking of quiet, have you heard from Reese?
as soon as he was strong enough to stand, he left without a word.
any idea where he went or when he's coming back?
I'm afraid only Mr. Reese can answer those questions.
good-bye, Ms. Shaw.

just keep 'em coming.
okay.
you think you can hustle me?
come on, man, it's just a lucky shot.
well, your luck just ran out, pal.
fellas, hey - hey!
Hey, come on, somebody help me!
take it easy, guys!
let me know if this is taking it easy.
Agh, stop!

I'll be going out for provisions later.
please let me know if there's anything in particular you require.

false Gods, Pseudepigrapha In The Modern Age?
doing a little light reading, Ms. Groves?
I know it's been hard for you, Harold, what with everything you've been through.
and now even John's left.
still, you really shouldn't take it out on her.
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking... about you ignoring her.
she has a new number for us.
how did you get this?
are you communicating with the machine?
I understand why you want to quit, Harold.
but now is not the time.
she wants us to work together.
I knew you were holding out on me.
must you do that?
so we have another number.
I haven't decided.
decided?
I didn't think you got to decide.
actually, I do.
okay, well, is that going to happen anytime soon, or should I be looking for some action elsewhere?
something wrong, Finch?
no, nothing. We should get to work.
you're in the hospital's employee database as Dr. Anne Moore.
you sure you don't want to play MD, Harold?
I never made a convincing doctor, even when I was one.
no, I think it's best if I stay here and find out as much as possible about Claypool.
so what are the details on this guy?
he lives and works in Maryland.
until recently, he was an IT consultant at a software company, Runyon Technology Solutions.
his most recent credit card charges are at the hospital gift shop.
what room's he in?
that's the strange part. There's no record of him in the hospital's admissions system.
I got him. He's here.
then his medical records must be on file.
I found them.
according to this, his diagnosis is glioblastoma multiforme.
brain tumor.
does it give a prognosis?
terminal.
so, assuming this guy is the victim, who would want to kill a dying man?
I suppose that's what we need to find out.
and how are you doing today, Mr. Claypool?
I suspect more honeybee than dragonfly.
excuse me?
lifespans.
dragonfly is four months. Honeybee is four weeks.
well, so long as you don't go mayfly on me, we won't have a problem.
are you new? Or have I just forgotten you?
you haven't forgotten me.
Oh, well, give it time.
my mind, it's like a computer with a corrupted file system.
I know I want to remember something, and I go to open the file, and then it's just gone.
and then, the next thing I know, memories come flooding back and out of me like a loon.
including a few that really shouldn't.
and what memories are those?
Mr. Claypool?
have you hard-coded the essential values?
对不起?
we must check the database after every operation.
excuse me, Doctor...
Moore.
I haven't seen you on this floor before.
that's because I haven't been here before.
I just transferred in.
from where? - New York General.
what's your specialty?
clinical oncology and palliative care. What's yours?
let me know if you need anything.
sure.
Finch, Claypool has a government security detail.
what did you say his job was?
it consultant. I realize that's somewhat vague.
a Maryland address, vague job title, security detail
I'd say he's got top-secret clearance or better.
he said his tumor was causing memories to flood out of him, including some that shouldn't.
could be... someone's planning on shutting him up for good.
his security detail is using a three-man wedge formation.
meaning what?
meaning they're Secret Service.
Finch... who the hell is this guy?
are they sparrows, dad?
Oh, close.
tell you what.
you help me with the truck, and I'll help you with the birds, hmm?
okay.
engine's flooded, and I can't for the life of me figure out why.
Where's the socket wrench? I had it right here in my hand.
um, dad?
I don't know where my head is lately.
here, you want to try one?
don't lose it.
gonna need every piece.
nothing in here that doesn't have a reason to be.
except the dirt.
I'll get that.
sorry, took longer than I
look.
I'll be damned.
but you're not supposed to take things apart like that.
you understand, Harold?
well, if they don't want you to get inside, they ought to build them better.
okay, son.
you held up your end.
you still want to know what kind of bird that is?
any progress, Ms. Shaw?
Claypool's security detail won't leave his side.
you find out anything more on your end?
no.
his minimal digital footprint tends to support your idea that he did secret work for the government, but it also makes it exceedingly difficult to determine the true nature of any threat.
well, I can get rid of the guard dogs.
I just need a gallon of anything flammable.
what?
Oh, relax, Finch. We're in a hospital.
ms. Shaw, I'm sure there are ways to get to Claypool that do not involve any kind of combustion.
fine.
but I'll need a partner.
you could be a hospital administrator.
I'm afraid I'm unable to do that.
ms. Groves is requiring additional supervision at the moment.
hang on.
uh, Claypool has a visitor.
a woman, looks to be about his age.
tall, brown hair.
like this?
Yes.
thank you. - You're welcome.
his wife. Records show they've been married a little over 20 years.
no - no. Stop.
honey, please - Wait, how did you get in here?
Arthur, it's me. - How did you get in here?
the patient's in distress. Step aside.
he's not in distress - just confused.
what do you want? - Nothing! I'm just here to see you.
I don't understand wh- No, you- you don't have any authority to be here.
I can't listen to you because this is a secure floor, and you don't have SCI clearance.
you are not at work.
Arthur, please, just look around.
you are in a hospital room.
first of all, who do you think you are to talk to me this way?
I'm Diane.
I'm your wife.
you just don't remember.
no. No.
uh... I don't have time for these games.
I am on a deadline.
I have to fix it.
fix what?
Samaritan.
it has to be operational before they-- Okay, that's enough.
Samaritan? What are you talking about, Arthur?
they don't think I know what they're gonna do, but I actually do know what they're gonna do.
they want to kill it, but I will not let them.
I have taken precautions.
just take it easy, Mr. Claypool.
he is not deceived who knows himself to be deceived.
um, excuse me. I'll - I'll be back.
Finch, did you hear that?
that seems to answer the question of whether Claypool worked for the government.
Yeah, on something called Samaritan?
the name is familiar.
I'll see what I can dig up.
well, I don't think I'll be getting close to Claypool anytime soon.
but I can get to the next best thing.
it's no Starbucks, but it gets the job done.
I hadn't really noticed.
I'm - I'm sorry about the scene back there.
compared to what I'm used to, it's nothing.
I don't know how you do it.
me, I hate hospitals.
and now it seems it's where I spend all my time.
when was he diagnosed?
about a year ago.
the signs were all there.
I just didn't want to see them.
he was getting lost in the neighborhood.
he had a change in his temperament.
Mrs. Claypool, do you know of anyone who'd want to hurt your husband?
no. He was - is the most gentle man.
why would you ask?
his security detail.
Oh, them. No.
they're just here because of where he worked.
and where was that?
the National Security Agency.
he would not want me to tell you that, but I don't really see the point in hiding it anymore.
your husband must be a pretty important guy.
I wouldn't know.
he never talked to me about his work, so I finally just stopped asking, and then...
we kind of stopped talking altogether.
talking's overrated.
I mean, that must have been really hard.
not as hard as realizing the person you spent half your life with doesn't even know who you are anymore.
and I suppose that's why I keep coming back here.
just on the hope that Arthur will remember who I am, even for a moment, and if he does, I'm going to be there.
I'm sorry.
I... should get back to work.
his security detail is gone.
and Claypool?
excuse me.
where is the patient that was assigned to this room?
Oh, he was taken to Radiology.
Finch, Claypool's wife said he was NSA.
that fits.
I knew I'd heard Samaritan before.
it was a classified NSA project.
congress de-funded and then shut it down in 2005, which is clearly the time Claypool is living in.
well, if Claypool was career NSA, then he'd be read in on all sorts of top-secret information.
information he's now shouting for anyone to hear.
well, I can think of about 15 foreign intelligence agencies that would kill for that intel.
that occurred to me as well.
as did the possibility that the threat may be from his own security detail.
to protect the government's secrets.
you need to get close to him.
easier said than done.
okay, I'm in.
be careful, Ms. Shaw.
I have no backup that I can send you.
well, then, I'll be quick.
relax, Mr. Claypool. - Wait a minute.
a syringe in the trashcan?
Claypool would have been injected with a radio tracer prior to his scan.
it's sodium pentothol.
who has them?
and where is Rudy?
this isn't a scan.
it's an interrogation.
is everything all right?
no. Whoever the threat against Claypool is, they're already here.
Freeze! Don't move.
ms. Shaw?
so much for being quick.
what you building there, son?
it's an array of floating gate transistors, configured as a series of NAND gates.
it's a memory system.
watch.
now just watch this.
dad.
I'm making you a memory to help you remember stuff like turning off the stove, and if I keep working on it,
I think I can make it so it can remember all the things that you can't.
now, we talked about this.
I mean, what's wrong with me can't be fixed by you or by anybody else, okay?
but what if I build a machine with lots of memory, one that could think?
well, even if you could, even if you could fill it with all my memories, it still wouldn't be me.
you know, not everything that's broken was meant to be fixed.
you understand?
Hello? - Ms. Shaw?
I figured it was you. How'd you find me?
I triangulated the phone nearest to your last GPS signal.
where are you?
locked in an office. Easton took my guns and phone.
I assumed as much, which is why I've relocated to better monitor the situation.
you're here?
I'm in the parking lot.
good.
while I figure out a way out of this, you can keep an eye on Claypool.
um, I think it best if I remain here and try to identify who drugged him.
Finch, why-- Oh, I found something.
the woman posing as the Imaging Technician, she avoided the cameras by wearing a hat on the way out, but before that, she logged into the Imaging Room's computer.
an Elizabeth Ross.
we need to find out what she was interrogating Claypool about.
I couldn't tell.
I just heard him say the name "Rudy."
Dr. Moore. Or whatever your name is.
please.
whoever put this identity together for you really knew what they were doing.
which brings me to my next questions.
who are you, and what do you want with Arthur Claypool?
Hello, Lionel.
Finch send you?
he's worried about you.
hell, we all are.
how'd you find me?
what do you think, I won my detective shield in a poker game?
glasses helped a little.
go home, Detective.
Lionel - I heard you.
you know what? This is a public place.
I've got just as much right to be here as you.
fine.
but if you're gonna sit here, you're gonna drink and not talk.
you understand? - Fine by me.
whiskey. Double.
bourbon and soda.
hold the bourbon.
so what agency do you work with?
fsb, MSS? - You're wasting your time.
you should be protecting Claypool.
that tech dosed him with sodium pentothol.
how would you know something like that?
the same way you would, if you'd done any real field work.
you know, I can make things very unpleasant for you.
unpleasant?
Oh, you service boys are so polite.
look, whoever came after Claypool didn't get what they want.
they will try again.
you all right there, Dudley? You don't look so good.
any chance you spiked the Secret Service guy's fried rice?
no. - Then we have a problem.
indeed.
I think I've identified the threat to Claypool.
as a longtime employee of the NSA, he'd be a prime target for anyone obsessed with exposing the government's secret surveillance operations.
and then I remembered the technician's name.
a name shared with a hero of the Revolutionary War, more commonly known as Betsey Ross.
revolutionary War?
I'll give you one guess who that might be.
vigilance. And they're here.
doctor?
why do you have a gun?
what happened to his guards?
we have to go.
Why?
because there are people coming after your husband.
what kind of people?
the kind you need a gun for. Grab his clothes.
Mr. Claypool.
wake up.
what?
you need to come with us, sir.
Why? Where are we going?
to a nicer room.
no, I don't want a nicer room.
sir, sir, you really - just listen to her.
just listen to what she tells you.
who are you?
if we can get you out of here-- What are you doing with my clothes?
let go of me, both of you, or I'll have you removed!
he won't come with me, Harold.
please calm down.
Harold, I - Arthur, come on.
we need to leave.
that's right.
finally, somebody I recognize.
how long has it been?
quite some time.
Sandra's parents are going out of town.
what about you, Harold? You coming?
when was the last time they changed that sign?
why would they need to?
exactly.
Paris has a population of 9 million.
who cares?
you can't get to Paris from Lassiter.
I'll take you to Paris.
Allo?
Allo?
holy crap.
how'd you do that?
dude, that was way too much fun to be legal.
I'm gonna need you to come with me.
it's about your dad.
so you two know each other?
Harold and I go all the way back to MIT.
the mighty engineers, huh?
you should have seen us, two young turks at the dawn of the information age.
we were gonna shape the future, remember, Harold?
I do. - Yes, but so do I.
you're limping. Are you hurt?
no, it's just an old injury that never healed quite right.
this way.
you know, Harold was the most brilliant of all of us.
if anybody was going to change the world, we knew it would be him.
you know, what did you end up doing? What's your field of expertise?
insurance.
he's got a gun!
who are those people?
why are they shooting at us? What do they want?
you, Arthur.
me? What did I do to them?
okay. Okay.
okay, you'll be safe here while I make arrangements to get you both out of harm's way.
harm's way? Why, are we in danger?
Oh, yes, the gun people.
what was that all about?
your job, Arthur.
my job?
you did work for the NSA?
not in front of her.
Yes, I worked for them.
I expect the people shooting at us knew that as well.
they're not trying to kill you, Arthur, at least not until they get some information out of you.
what information?
when you were being scanned at the hospital, the technician asked you who had them.
them.
and you answered,"Rudy."
I did?
who were you talking about?
uh, um... I don't know. I'm sorry.
that's all right. Why don't you rest?
Harold... what do you have to do with all this?
I just heard that you might be in some trouble.
come on, let's get you settled.
you really shouldn't stand so close to the windows.
who are you people?
we're the ones keeping you and your husband safe.
what about his security detail?
shouldn't the Secret Service know we're here?
right now, the only people I trust are in this room.
you feeling better?
Harold, do you recall Arise, ye sons of MIT? - Oh, I
arise, ye sons of MIT in loyal brotherhood the future beckons unto ye and life is full and good arise, and raise your steins on high tonight shall ever be a memory that will never die ye sons of MIT
John's gonna be sorry he missed that.
now, Arthur, what was Samaritan?
Oh, Samaritan is truly a remarkable project.
you say it is remarkable. Tell me about it.
its primary function is to detect potential acts of terror through analysis of large data sets.
specifically, it will have the ability to anticipate acts of aggression and suggest strategic countermeasures before the perpetrators can act.
it sounds like quite a project.
Oh, Samaritan is revolutionary.
not so much for what it does, but how it does it.
the system was designed to function autonomously, to continually adapt and upgrade itself through past experiences.
you're saying that it can remember and learn.
Yes. Harold, it's what we always dreamed of.
Samaritan is a true artificial intelligence.
you're right, Arthur.
that is remarkable.
excuse me.
is he talking about what I think he's talking about?
it would appear so.
but then that would mean-- That there was a second machine.
and Arthur built it.
copy that. I found Harold, and I'm taking them both home now.
son, he wandered half a mile away from home tonight.
what happens when it drops below zero?
if you're stretched past the point where you can give him what he needs, maybe it's time to find a place that can.
I'm sorry, son.
I don't know why this keeps happening.
I forget who people are, where I am.
it's okay, dad. - No, it's not.
you have greatness in you, Harold.
your mind, the things that you can see
it's not- Dad-- And it's wasted here.
you should be heading off to college, not taking care of an old man.
I'm not going anywhere.
and besides, they're building a computer network right now that's going to connect all the universities in the country.
if I can't leave town, I'll bring the information to me.
I'll find a way.
careful, son. Don't be reckless.
don't get yourself into something you shouldn't.
if they don't want you to get inside, they ought to build it better.
well-- Come on.
this machine you built, Arthur...
Samaritan - where is it now?
nowhere.
Samaritan was destroyed years ago. 2005.
destroyed?
Why?
well, after 9/11, the government had everyone and their cat trying to build a system - that could watch everything. - They came to you as well.
Yes. I told them the only way they could achieve what they wanted was to build something that not only watched, but understood what it was watching.
an AI.
I know you always said artificial intelligence was a fool's errand, Harold, but...
I was this close.
close?
to making Samaritan operational.
truth is, I couldn't get it to work.
I mean, I could've, if those pinhead bureaucrats would have just given me a few more weeks.
I know I could have cracked it.
and that's when Congress shut you down.
well, not just us.
all the programs. Stellar Wind, Tides, Genysis, Futuremap, Genoa.
within six months, they were all gone.
they came for Samaritan February 25, 2005.
for fear of "Violating civil liberties," or so they said.
and you thought there was another reason.
the government wanted a system, Harold.
they weren't just going to give up.
they let Congress shut us down, all except for that piece of crap Prism, but that was just to throw anyone off the scent.
of what?
they'd already found it.
someone else had got there first.
and built it.
when I said "Drink," I didn't mean club soda.
Finch appoint you to be my designated driver too?
no, smart guy.
I'm two years sober.
Why?
because back when I was doing a lot of stupid things, drinking was one of them.
and then this jackass in a suit showed up on my backseat and forced me at gunpoint to help him and take a look at who I was.
why'd I quit drinking?
you.
don't let it go to your head.
another.
what do you think, you're the only one that's hurting?
my partner got shot.
so tell me how hiding out in your old man's watering hole is gonna fix it.
saw the sign for the army base about five miles back.
I thought maybe this was where you were stationed.
until I saw the picture.
and the resemblance.
my dad was here before he was deployed to Vietnam.
did four tours.
he was a bona fide war hero.
was he killed in action?
no.
at the refinery where he worked.
hadn't even been home two months.
that's rough.
but what's that have to do with what happened to Carter?
nothing.
just proves that no matter what we do or don't do in this world, bad things are still gonna happen.
it's... pointless.
irrelevant.
how can you say that?
you saved lots of people, including me.
you're saying that was pointless?
all right.
let's go.
I'm not leaving.
I wasn't talking about leaving.
I'm not gonna fight you, Lionel.
come on.
come on.
come on.
okay, that should do it.
this time tomorrow, Arthur and Diane Claypool will be Henry and Elaine McCarthy.
I've also arranged a room for Arthur at a Toronto hospital.
we'll leave first thing in the morning.
if there's anything I can do - Enough!
I'm sorry, I was just trying to talk to him.
who are you? Why don't you just leave me alone?
Arthur, it's okay.
no. And you can't keep me here.
the truth fears no questions.
Arthur, it's me, Harold.
and this is Diane, your wife.
how come I remember you and not her?
because tumors do mysterious things to memory.
no. - It's like you said.
your file system is corrupted. - No.
that's not it.
I remember Diane.
Diane is dead.
I buried her two years ago, on June 12, 2011.
you do remember.
go.
perimeter is secure, ma'am.
ma'am?
he works for you?
as did you at one time, Agent Shaw.
I assume you always wanted to meet me.
control.
I was concerned that you might disrupt my attempts to get close to Arthur.
however, you proved to be quite useful, saving him from those misguided privacy terrorists and arranging it so I could meet your employer, who I've heard so much about.
by the way, I didn't catch your last name, Harold.
what is it that you want from Arthur?
just information.
the location of his greatest achievement, Samaritan.
Samar - No. Samaritan was destroyed.
I know the official story, Arthur.
I also know about the drives.
so... where are they?
I don't know what you're talking about.
all right, stop it. He's telling you the truth.
he doesn't know.
I'll find out soon enough.
and since you and I have had the good fortune of meeting, you can help me recover something else that belongs to me.
your greatest achievement.
Oh, I'm afraid I can't do that.
one of you is going to tell me what it is I want to know.
and whoever does... will be the one who gets to leave here...
what do you think... you're the only one that's hurting?
Finch send you?
he's worried about you.
she has a new number for us.
so you two know each other?
Harold and I go all the way back to MIT.
he said his tumor was causing memories to flood out at him.
there was a second machine, and Arthur built it.
do you know of anyone who'd want to hurt your husband?
vigilance.
I suppose this was inevitable.
control.
one of you is gonna tell me what it is I want to know.
how lucky are we, Agent Hersh?
I thought I was getting Arthur's broken toy, Samaritan, but you, Harold...
I know who you are, what you've done for us, but since you stole my device,
I've been worried its intel might dry up.
that's why you've done these terrible things to Arthur, obliterated his wife's identity, stolen her life...
all for a contingency, a plan B?
but now you're here.
a plan B might not be necessary.
you can tell me where you hid my program.
I don't know. It moved itself.
it doesn't answer to me anymore.
the first one to talk gets to live.
I bet your friend will give me Samaritan eventually.
congress shut down Samaritan in 2005, destroyed the code... it doesn't exist.
of course it exists.
please, I don't understand.
you told me you took precautions.
two drives disappeared during the Samaritan purge.
where are they?
I can't access the right file.
trying.
it's corrupted.
we'll need some enhanced methods.
agent Hersh, do you have some ideas?
agent Shaw...
it has been a thrill watching you work.
two to the head, please.
and be careful of the blood spray.
sorry about the blood spray.
I told you, Harold... We were supposed to work together.
scold him later, Root. Cut me loose.
come on.
let's move. Make a left at the end of the hallway to the service elevator.
this way, go.
elevator code's 5228#. Go!
nice to see you again.
you're behind the wheel.
in the front.
stealing a car, almost dying...
it reminds me of the old days at MIT, Harold.
we got to move.
engines are go.
you're right, Arthur, just like college.
where are you off to?
I need your help with the tractor today.
got to plow the fields, then you can go see your friends.
dad, we can't, not today.
where are you taking those bags?
I packed them for you.
you're moving.
you remember The Pines?
the staff there...
they can take care of you better than I can.
y-yeah, of course. Of course.
it'll just be for a little while, till I'm done.
I'm making something that'll help you.
you're still working on that memory thing.
not just memory.
it's more of a friend.
maybe one day, this guy will watch over you, learn from you...
protect you.
well, if anyone can do it, it's you.
the world spins on dreamers like you, Harold.
Yeah, I should change, shouldn't I?
you know, I'm gonna tell everybody at The Pines my son is changing the world.
why does Control want the drives to a broken program?
the program's only broken until somebody smart fixes it.
we should hurry. For all we know,
Arthur gave Vigilance the location of the drives during interrogation, and Control will find us soon, somehow.
Arthur, come on. - Yeah.
are you sure that you did everything correctly?
excuse me? - 'Cause if the alarm was not disabled, then Nathan is gonna get, um, expelled.
Nathan? - His mind has slipped back to 1981, to MIT.
our friend convinced us to do a hack, a prank at the HarvardYale game.
everything will be fine, Arthur.
it was sort of an anti-nuclear proliferation statement.
and to impress certain ladies.
a rebel and a skirt chaser.
no, no, no, no, no, Harold doesn't need to chase.
he's got a certain gravitational pull with the female population.
you know, I think that Nathan should be here by now.
Arthur. - Yeah?
Nathan isn't coming.
you've drifted away.
Nathan... he's dead, isn't he?
Arthur, what Control said...
now, I need you to think very hard...was it true?
did you make a backup?
save it, Harold. He's closed for business.
of course I made a backup.
it's just that that woman seemed quite dangerous, so I played the tumor card.
it was a ruse, remembering to forget.
you're growing on me, Arthur.
who are you?
never mind.
Arthur, we need that backup, even if it's broken.
Samaritan is our best chance to ensure your safety.
can you remember where it is?
Yeah. It's with...
it's with a, uh, dear friend of ours.
Arthur's back with us, but I'm worried about Ms. Groves.
we should have heard from her.
Hello, there.
how are you, Miss May?
call me Root.
of course. And you can call me Control.
I believe our interests are aligned.
the government can help you escape.
our department can protect you from Harold and his friend in the suit.
you have been running missions for them, correct?
I'm more of an independent contractor.
is that why they committed you to an asylum...
to keep you contained?
seems everybody wants to lock me up.
what I saw in the hotel confirms something that I have long suspected.
you have administrative access.
you have found a way inside the machine.
I want you to give me that access, for the sake of your country, and perhaps for other payment.
it'd be like giving a five-year-old keys to a jet...
irresponsible and stupid.
well, that's a shame.
I was really hoping to do this the easy way.
however...
there are other options.
Hey, rise and shine, wonder boy.
truce, right?
cause round two won't go so good for you.
I'm not gonna fight you.
that was very stupid of you, Lionel.
you should know better than to hit me.
you're lucky to be alive. - I won my points, Holyfield.
are you getting us out of here?
you know, throw your weight around?
the yokel sheriff of East Bumblesquat can't read an NYPD badge.
better get comfortable.
this is the place.
our friend has a safe deposit box.
the drives are in it.
safe deposit box won't do us much good without the key.
Claypool's been rocking footed pajamas for months.
I doubt he still has it.
I'm afraid we've lost him to his medical alert button.
I was wondering why that thing didn't work.
Hello? - Hello.
can I help you with anything?
Yeah, do you have any Twizzlers?
we're here for a safe deposit box in the name of...
Smoot. Rudiger Smoot, box 433.
of course, Mr. Smoot.
this way, gentlemen.
just breathe.
this is fun.
in the 1960s, the government experimented with various substances to enhance interrogations.
a barbiturate in one arm to knock you out, an amphetamine in the other...
a roller coaster of sorts.
you can only take so many rounds of it before your heart explodes.
shall we begin?
where is it?
it is...
beyond your reach.
you think you're in charge?
it's adorable just how wrong you are.
your safe deposit box is just over here, Mr. Smoot.
who the hell is Rudiger Smoot?
it was a dare.
Arthur said I couldn't create a false identity sound enough to open a bank account.
the added challenge was the obviously fake name...
nickname "Rudy..."
the one Claypool was dishing about to Vigilance while he was jacked up on sodium pentothal.
if he told Vigilance the location, we'll soon have some rather aggressive privacy activists on our hands.
sooner than soon. We got company.
they're using tricked-out lasers to fry the security cams.
it's Vigilance.
I'll slow 'em down.
here we are. I'll need your key, Mr. Smoot.
no one gets hurt!
everybody down on the ground right now!
down, now! I'm not gonna tell you again!
I've always said banks were meant to be robbed.
to the left! Move it! - You heard him! Move! Move!
all the way back! Keep moving!
the cavalry has arrived.
Anthony, 2 left, 2 right... - It's Hersh. Get out of there now.
drop your weapons and come out of the bank with your hands up.
I'll organize the defensive line.
good. I'll go to the vault.
Finch, get out now.
too late. Good luck, Miss Shaw.
you're on your own.
they got to let us out of here soon.
they're just keeping us in here for a laugh at this point.
nothing wrong with jail.
some of the best vacations I've ever had were behind bars.
you're a peach, you know that?
how about we just figure a way to get out of here and go home?
home?
what home, Lionel?
you know, I mean, you've never actually invited me over, but home...
meaning our friends and that thing we were doing.
what is it we were doing again?
helping people, keeping 'em safe so they could get home to their loved ones.
no offense, Lionel.
I know the whole "being a good guy" thing is new to you, but you're not fooling anyone, and neither will we.
we weren't helping people.
we were delaying the inevitable.
no one ever said we were gonna win, - but it doesn't mean you stop fighting. - No.
I've learned my lesson.
it's entropy, Lionel, decay.
we save someone, they'll still lose, just tomorrow, not today. And I know that now same as I know you'll probably go back to be a corrupt piece of garbage.
water finds its level.
you know what? She was the best of us...
better than me and a damn sight better than you.
and she got killed.
but where I come from, that doesn't mean you just give up.
Hey, Skip! We're done here.
you're free to go.
do whatever you want. I'll tell Finch I tried.
tell Finch...
thanks for the job.
I haven't heard from Glasses since last night.
that's not like him.
he probably needs our help, but there's no point, right?
we'd just be delaying the inevitable.
elevate her leg. Continue applying pressure.
you've done all you can. - Keep this. We won't be far.
Arthur, follow me.
ms. Shaw, what's your situation?
rock and a hard place.
I'd take out Vigilance, but they're the only ones keeping Hersh out.
I can probably handle an ISA tac team by myself, but no guarantees.
we need an escape route, but you have to be careful.
I urge you to consider what Mr. Reese would do.
brood.
as you've said, you're a hammer.
Mr. Reese is a scalpel.
this requires a bit more finesse.
well, I got finesse coming out of my ass, Harold.
stay right there.
I was wondering when you'd call.
this doesn't have to escalate. Everyone can walk out alive.
come on, no need to play games.
we both know I'm not a bank robber and you're not a hostage negotiator.
if you evacuate in the next 60 seconds, we'll let you live.
if not, your organization ceases to exist.
no records, no funerals.
you have no intention of letting us leave, but I'm glad we talked.
my sources tell me the drives hold intel about a worldwide surveillance system, but judging from your concern,
I'm guessing it's something even more explosive than that...
something worth dying for.
we will expose the abuses our government has perpetrated.
good-bye, Agent.
the government wanted an open system.
that the NSA could control...
targeting individuals at whim?
but it's broken.
so there's no reason to be scared.
no.
meet Samaritan.
ai... You always said it was impossible, and you were always right about everything.
there's something else.
the world breaks everyone, and afterward...
many are strong at the broken places.
a farewell to arms...
that's my handwriting.
it's dated February 24, 2005.
what does it mean?
I haven't the foggiest, but look at my penmanship.
it's exquisite.
you have the power to make this stop.
help me, please.
I am trying to help you.
I wasn't talking to you.
tell me, where is the machine? How do you access it?
all you need to do is give me your username and password.
all of this could stop.
did I say something funny?
you're asking all the wrong questions.
I...
am the interface.
if you want to talk to her...
just give me a phone.
will this do?
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm a bit tied up.
you're not gonna get it just yet.
how do you use the machine?
I don't.
she uses me.
you view the machine as your superior?
No...Much more...
my power, my reason for existing, my friend.
the machine looks out for me.
I believe you.
I believe you have a link to the machine, anthropomorphic delusions aside.
you say you're an interface?
your eyes and your ears are your ports, input and output?
we can put a stop to that.
there is a bone in the back of your ear.
it's the stapes...
or stirrup.
it's very small.
it's very important.
without it...
sound can't travel...
from your ear to your brain.
a stapedectomy...
is usually done under anesthesia, but I'm afraid that just won't be the case today.
no, please.
you say the machine looks out for you?
then why are you in this cell? Why has it let this happen?
this friend that you love so much...
...It's abandoned you.
time flows outward in all directions.
this island... February 24, 2005...
the day that Samaritan was shut down.
no, that was February 25th.
your note is dated one day earlier.
one day earlier.
cafeteria lunch was terrible.
I did it.
I solved it before they shut me down.
Harold, Samaritan is alive.
come on.
No!
no.
I need more power.
if they don't want to let people inside, they ought to build it better.
alive? It's not alive, Arthur.
the project broke me, but humans are broken from the moment of conception.
mutations, defects... it's all so wonderful.
the chance of disaster.
we fail, we learn, we fail.
my program was too perfect.
you're talking about evolutionary algorithms, genetic programming.
that day, Harold, I broke it.
I forced it to delete bits of itself...
its code, its blood... and then reboot.
rebirth...
flailing in the dark.
a loop, ten times a second, and after ten hours,
Harold, 360, 000 mutations, it would live or die trying, and it lived.
it sparked. It stirred.
for 30 seconds, it smiled and then died.
and the next day the government shut you down.
that's why you saved it.
protecting my child.
is this the man with the glasses?
you know, since we first crossed paths,
I've tried to find information about you, but there is none.
I'm quite private. - As am I.
I think we have a lot in common.
I'd like to work together, make a deal.
you don't have to die.
civil liberties cannot be forged in blood.
violent revolt is an American value.
do you know the man you're protecting?
we believe he's building a secret system, a system the government plans to put in place to spy on all of us.
now, he must be held accountable.
and the world needs to know about this program.
either let us in, or we will blow the vault wide open.
and clock's ticking.
ms. Shaw, we're running out of time.
vigilance claims to have explosives.
Yeah, no kidding. It gave me an idea.
you ever made a pipe bomb?
there's a sewer main under the bank.
when Vigilance blows the vault, this will punch through the supply-closet floor.
then I grab you, and we go down to sewer town before Hersh catches up.
this plan feels rather reckless.
there's a time for a scalpel and a time for a hammer.
it's hammer time.
we have your friends surrounded.
so, if you try anything, I will have them all killed.
and then I will take the ear you have left and then your eyes and then your tongue.
do you understand? - You're too late.
the machine's already talking.
you're too old, older than 40.
you can't hear a sound above 15 kilohertz.
but I can...
with the ear I've got left.
my friend's been beeping morse code at that frequency since you brought your phone in here.
she's been talking to me the whole time, telling me about you.
you're scared of me, even with all these guards watching.
by the way, that one has a bum knee.
you're so scared of me that you hid a knife in your pocket.
I couldn't reach it till you got close enough to cut me.
you still have a scalpel.
I'd call that a fair fight.
suit up. As soon as they hit the vault, we're going in.
last chance.
I don't know if you'll survive the explosion.
give us Claypool and his drives.
good day, Mr. Collier.
Arthur. - How could I forget?
how could I?
there are certain unforgettable things, impossible, unerasable.
Arthur, I need you to consider what may happen when that door opens, how Samaritan could be abused.
end this. Destroy the drive. - No. This is life...
or as close as we mortals come to saying,"Let there be light.
it is extraordinary, and it is beautiful.
so are mushroom clouds, in their own way.
155 Manhattan project scientists sent a petition to President Truman begging him not to use the bomb, but they had created a demon too great to resist.
Harold, this is knowledge.
it's what we fought for. It'll just all be lost.
no, your knowledge will not be lost.
Nathan and I used your ideas.
we built it.
I was right. There was another project.
it was you.
I'm not sure that we should have built it.
we created it recklessly. People died.
your machine... is it wonderful?
wonderful...
Yes, and terrible.
we saved good people and lost good people.
in the end, I'm afraid we've only given the deck a shuffle.
everything slides towards chaos.
your creation...
it brings us poor souls a cupful of order.
your child is a dancing star.
it's not my child. It's a machine.
a false dichotomy... it's all electricity.
does it make you laugh? Does it make you weep?
Yes.
what's more human?
but these people outside...
if they get your Samaritan, they will hurt it, imprison it, enslave it, and use it to enslave others.
is that the life that you would wish for your child?
good-bye.
I'll remember you.
Harold, they're detonating it now.
it'll cause a shock wave.
get away from the door.
cover your ears and hide.
that was better than skydiving.
here.
come on, boys.
go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
let's keep moving.
the drives.
I destroyed them. They're gone.
well, we've still got you.
kill the others.
on your knees.
now!
we got to go.
leave him. We got to go! Go!
I heard you might need a hand.
Mr. Reese, I am inordinately happy to see you.
forget the shmoopy time. We got to move.
Lionel, your face looks good all covered up like that.
all right, let's go.
Oh, my goodness. That smells horrendous.
come on, fellas, into the muck.
we got him.
where are the drives?
the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
your guards were no match for her.
I'm not gonna tell you anything.
you're not talking to me.
Hi, there.
what do you want me to tell this bitch?
why have you done this?
the machine belongs to me.
no.
I don't belong to anyone anymore.
you, however, are mine.
I protect you.
the only thing you love lives at 254 Wendell Street,
cambridge, Massachusetts.
I guard it...
same as I guard you.
do not question my judgment.
do not pursue me or my agents.
trust in me.
I am always watching.
what do you want?
to save you.
from what?
save me from what?
isn't she the best?
Hello, Arthur.
I'm gonna sit with you for a while, if that's all right.
I'm glad you built it, Harold.
somebody would have eventually.
for all our sakes, I'm glad it was you.
welcome back, Arthur.
Harold, I'm disappearing.
every time I come back, my memories are fewer.
I don't remember the color of Diane's eyes.
forgetting is a piercing wound keen as the first loss.
the memories are there, Arthur. They're just hidden.
I'm sorry I left without saying good-bye.
tell Shaw I was touched she came to look for me.
where are you, Ms. Groves?
I wish you'd listened.
we were supposed to help Claypool together.
then the drives would've never fallen into the wrong hands.
Arthur destroyed the drives. - Are you sure?
the bank manager, Karen Wallace?
we lost track of her in the explosion.
no, Harold, they found her body stuffed in a closet.
she was murdered just before you arrived.
who was in the vault with us, then?
that's my problem now.
please put Arthur on the phone.
you have a call.
the machine has something for you, to send you on your way.
where are we going when you retire?
who knows? We may be on Mars by then.
I'd take Hawaii.
you've always been so practical, tethering me to reality when I spin away.
you know I love you.
I don't say it often enough, but I do.
I know.
there are a lot of things about you I know.
I love you too.
dad?
now listen closely.
men are going to come and visit you.
they're going to tell you that I did terrible things, committed treason.
don't believe them, all right?
do I know you, young man?
what's that one called, dad?
ms. Groves picked the locks on the gate and disabled the ankle-bracelet sensors.
I suppose the machine told her where I'd hidden them.
welcome home.
I'm not staying.
I came back to protect you.
you're someone the world can't afford to lose.
but I lost a friend because of your machine.
we trusted blindly, but I'm not so sure he cares who matters and who doesn't.
I came back to say good-bye, Finch.
John, you can't go.
I can't stay here.
I was able to swap out the drives.
various interested parties think they were destroyed.
excellent work.
did you examine the drives' contents or tell anyone about them?
absolutely not.
thank you for your service.
you have earned my highest esteem.
my Samaritan...
you are destined for great things.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considers these people irrelevant.
we don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
911. What is your emergency? - I need you to calm down.
911. What's your emergency? - Shut up! Shut up!
911. What's your emergency?
911. What's your emergency?
911. What's your emergency?
you gotta help me. They've broken into my car.
are you in the car now, sir? No. Thank God. I'm across the street.
good. Please do not attempt to approach the vehicle.
now do you see any weapons?
they're ripping up the interior. They're everywhere!
all right, and are they attempting to steal the vehicle?
what? Don't be ridiculous.
squirrels can't drive.
I'm afraid squirrels fall outside the purview of 911.
let me connect you to a non-emergency operator.
good job, Harold.
you sure you've never done this kind of thing before?
not quite, although I do have some applicable experience.
I don't know, Finch. Maybe we should get Fusco to question those squirrels.
Reese is right.
could be a whole rodent carjacking ring.
keeping entertained, are we?
I'd be happy to trade places, Ms. Shaw.
I admit I'm not sure what makes me the best fit for this particular undercover mission.
at a desk, surrounded by monitors, helping people in danger.
all you're missing is the dog.
besides, would you really want someone to call 911 and get me?
point taken. These calls represent the numbers we never get.
crimes that unfold too quickly for the machine to detect.
so it's a win-win, Finch.
you get to help them while looking into our latest number.
911 operator and trainee supervisor.
she's got a stack of commendations. So what's the threat?
911 operators are often witnesses at trial, targets of lawsuits, and...
now that I've hacked the routing system, I can monitor every call she gets.
Sandra? Her car went off a bridge into the water.
she's sinking. I don't know what to do.
okay, hello, Ma'am, can you hear me? What's your name?
Jackie. I'm trapped. Oh, my god.
all right, Jackie, just relax. We're gonna get you outta there. Okay?
cars can float for up to two minutes, so we got a little time.
the doors are stuck, and the windows have shorted out.
please help. - Jackie, are you wearing heels?
Yes, these stupid 4-inch pumps.
all right, those pumps are gonna save your life.
your car window's weak spot is up front near the door hinges.
I want you to kick that spot as hard as you can - with your heel, okay? - Go!
it worked!
unit 1234 arriving on scene.
we have eyes on the car. We'll take it from here.
all right, Jackie. Rescue team's on the way.
she's good. At handling other people's emergencies.
wonder how she'll hold up when she's faced with one of her own.
murder weapon on the Kipling case.
what do you think, Fusco? Right size, right shape?
wrong edge. Wound was serrated, remember?
Hey, Fusco, hold up a second.
suspect's guilty as hell, but we can't get his DNA without a warrant.
the DA wants to kick him.
ever hear of dumpster diving, Kane?
excuse me. Detective Fusco?
just transferred over from the 12th, and I caught this case.
Tara Cooke, 29.
found by the East River yesterday morning. Head bashed in, wallet stolen.
mugging gone bad, right?
everyone said you were the guy to talk to.
look, kid, they bumped you up to Homicide Task Force for a reason.
they don't all come with instructions. Figure it out.
you want something from me too? Is this a bad time, Detective?
it ain't good.
my brain's being picked on everything from interrogation to evidence collection.
hardly surprising.
your arrest of Officer Simmons brought you no small amount of esteem.
perhaps you should be flattered that your peers are soliciting your advice.
Yeah, yeah.
speaking of which, did you receive the name I sent?
Yeah, it was, uh... Sandra Nicholson.
Yeah, I mean, other than a couple of parking tickets, she's clean.
but she did have a sealed juvie record.
must have gotten into some kind of trouble as a kid.
I don't suppose you could take a peek behind that seal.
I'm sorry, pal.
with the whole HR takedown, hit the force pretty hard.
the whole department's under scrutiny.
so unless you got a court order, I guess I'm gonna have to say no.
understood. I thank you for your time, Detective.
and as for your newfound popularity, - you've earned it. - Yeah.
see these bruises? Livor mortis.
happens when a body stays in one place, okay?
Tara was found on her right side.
these bruises are on the left. And look.
forensics found industrial carpet fibers stuck in the wound.
but she wasn't wrapped up in any carpet. Body was moved.
this isn't a mugging at all.
let's get to work. Show me what else you got.
uh, yeah.
911. What's your emergency? My name is Aaron.
some men are trying to break into my apartment.
Hi, Aaron. I'm Sandra.
I'm gonna help you out, okay? Are you alone?
the sitter wasn't here when I got home from school, and mom's at work.
all right, I'm sending the police right away.
all units, 1031 in progress. 216 Bakersfield Way, unit 4E.
code Three. Repeat, Code Three.
Mr. Reese, Ms. Shaw, he may not be our number, but...
we got it, Finch. We're on our way.
Sandra, they're breaking through the door.
is there any place you can hide?
there's a crawlspace behind a panel in my closet.
perfect. Go there now.
okay, Sandra, I'm in. Okay, you're doing great, Aaron.
now I want you to stay super quiet, not a sound.
where is it? Are you sure? - Said it was going to be here.
keep looking. Sandra?
it worked. They're leaving.
in the closet.
No! Aaron?
no, no, no! No!
aaron, are you all right?
Aaron! - No!
the men want me to tell you something.
what- what is it?
answer your phone.
what?
Hello?
so nice to meet you, Sandra.
I apologize for calling you on your personal cell phone, but for what we're about to do together, I need you mobile.
and what are we about to do?
anything I say.
you see, I've just taken this boy hostage, and unless you follow my instructions precisely, little Aaron is going to die.
who is this? What's your name? Really, Sandra?
a boy's life is at stake, and you want proper introductions.
how do I know Aaron is even real... that this kidnapping wasn't staged?
I'd be happy to cut off Aaron's hand and dump it outside your apartment at 362117th Avenue.
take a look at your phone.
now tell me exactly which body part you'd like him to lose first.
No!
I believe you. - Good.
now for the ground rules.
alert anyone to the situation, disobey any of my commands, attempt in any way to disconnect this call, and Aaron dies. Sounds simple enough.
I'm glad you think so.
command number one, call off the police you've dispatched to Aaron's home.
now.
all units, disregard 1031 at 216 Bakersfield Way.
the call was a hoax. Repeat, there is no emergency.
copy that. Sector Charlie canceling response.
excellent, Sandra.
you're gonna do just fine.
Finch, we're entering Aaron's apartment building.
any news?
aaron's been abducted by a man who was able to hack into the 911 private branch exchange and ensure that the boy's call went directly to Sandra.
any idea why he'd single her out?
could be a grudge.
one of Sandra's 911 calls gone bad. Doesn't explain the kid, though.
why would Sandra's number come up if Aaron's the one in danger?
if the machine gave us Sandra's number, her fate and Aaron's are entwined.
Finch, no sign of them or the kid. Try the webcam.
I used a remote administration tool to access Aaron's computer.
there he is.
guys who took him were pros.
they're not military. No sweep and clear.
flashy chrome pistol.
and that ring- a Gothic cross.
Templarios.
express kidnappers from a Mexican cartel. Best at what they do.
I've pinpointed the GPS signal from the mystery caller's phone.
it's in a car cruising Upper Manhattan. I'm on it.
I'll see if I can track down the cartel.
looks like your dead girl, Tara Cooke, worked at a private equity firm.
let's go check out her office.
we'll run the usual tests.
but first glance? Carpet fibers aren't a match.
your girl wasn't killed in her office.
Hey. Didn't Glasses give you the message? My dance card's booked.
I'm helping a rookie with a homicide. So unless the world's coming to an end
for a ten-year-old boy it is, unless we save him.
why didn't you say so? What do you need?
the Templarios.
any idea where they've been hanging out lately? I can't say for sure.
they used to frequent a bar up in Bedford Park called El Cetrero.
that's where I'd try. Good luck.
and you are? Brent Holm.
I worked side by side with Tara for two years.
I heard she was mugged. Why are you checking her office?
just have to rule some things out.
we'll provide the police with whatever you need.
did you know Tara as well? I should hope so. I hired her.
and this is my husband and CEO Ron Kincaid.
good to meet you both.
Tara was one of our top young executives. We intend to help in any way we can.
you know what would be really helpful?
if you could get us a copy of the security footage of Tara's last day at work.
it's done.
I've labeled Aaron's call a prank.
good.
now plug your headset into your phone. Your hands need to be free.
to do what?
shut down the building's backup generator.
if the power goes out, that generator is the only thing keeping this call center online.
why shut it down? Because I asked nicely.
I can be more emphatic, but people tend to get hurt when that happens.
good girl.
and try not to look so nervous, Sandra.
if I can see your hands shaking, everyone can.
is that in Washington heights?
how old would you say he was? Go get them as fast as you can.
now how long ago did you take the pills?
do you have a fire extinguisher in the house?
what was the man wearing? All right, sir.
what's your location? What's the apartment number?
well, then you need to get out of there as quickly as possible.
and how long has your cat been stuck in the AC duct?
do not attempt to save any of your possessions, okay? And have you had any alcohol?
what about the other passengers? Anyone hurt when the car hit you?
did you see which way he ran- Sandra...
I just wanted to thank you again for your help.
are you all right? - Fine. Thanks.
why would he send her to shut down the backup generator?
can I help you, Sandra? I'm such a klutz.
I think I dropped an earring back there this morning.
is there any way I could go in and take a look?
just sign in.
help ME
Oh, Sandra, did you really think I wouldn't see that?
you must not care about Aaron at all.
just like you didn't care about little Joseph 20 years ago.
with the right resources, you can access anything...
even sealed juvenile records.
the question is, are you doomed to make the same mistake twice?
creepy down here, isn't it?
all right.
now find the backup generator switch, and shut it off.
nicely done, Sandra.
just one more task to perform.
let's go to the server room.
now have a seat and sign in.
now...
pull up all the 911 calls that came in two days ago.
30, 918 emergencies.
new York, New York. It's a wonderful town.
okay, one more step, and Aaron is home free.
tell me, so we can get this over with.
I want you to delete them, Sandra- all of them.
I can't.
those calls are part of the public record.
they're evidence, confessions, dying words.
I won't.
I've told you what I require. Now you have to choose.
save 30, 000 phone calls or the life of one boy.
ms. Shaw, I do hope you're closing in on our mystery caller because he's proving to be quite elusive.
there's no evidence that he's broken into the camera feeds, yet he's somehow able to watch Sandra's every move.
thanks to the GPS coordinates you sent me,
I've got eyes on his car.
and in a minute... I'll have eyes on him.
ms. Shaw, did you find the caller?
we have a problem.
this guy's not just a voice, he's a ghost.
Finch, you wanna tell me what I'm holding here?
from the description, it sounds like a phone relay.
the caller's voice is carried from one phone, through the other, and on to Sandra.
his call could be originating from anywhere in the city - or the world. - Should I untape them?
maybe then you can trace the call. No, Ms. Shaw, please.
if we untether the phones, the call will disconnect, and Aaron may well be killed.
were you able to glean anything from the driver?
some guy paid him 1, 000 bucks to drive around all day with the phones in the back, never got a name.
if only I could determine how he's able to keep such a close eye on Sandra.
how many men were there? Did they both have guns?
ma'am, are you someplace safe? Did the dog try to bite you?
I understand. - Is the door locked?
and I'm not saying- Of course.
ms. Shaw, I have a pressing matter to attend to.
can you get a description of the man who paid the driver?
my pleasure.
think of it as an exchange, Sandra.
you delete a day's worth of calls, and I send Aaron home, happy and intact.
what good could deleting them possibly do anyone?
it's the simpler solution.
then why not just do it yourself if you have all these resources?
you know as well as I do that the terminal you're sitting at is the only way to access them, which means I need someone on the inside- you.
now enough talk. What's it gonna be, Sandra, the calls or the kid?
don't turn around.
I have remotely activated the mute function on your cell phone, so he can't hear us.
whoever's doing this to you has mounted a tiny webcam on your headset.
that's how he's been able to watch you no matter where you go.
how do you know about this? - No time to explain.
you have to trust me.
I have a team working to save Aaron, but we need to determine who's behind all of this and what he wants.
if deleting 30, 000 calls is the simpler solution, then that's likely just a smokescreen to hide the one call that our friend is truly concerned about.
if we could locate that call, we might be able to turn the tables on him.
I'm losing patience, Sandra.
I can't just hit delete once. I have to do it in batches.
it could take 15 minutes for an entire day, and to do that, I need an elite admin code.
only the head of IT has it on a key fob that
then stop wasting time, and go get that code!
while you do that, I'll stay here and find that call.
and remember, keep me out of your line of sight.
so I checked the security footage from Tara Cooke's last day at work.
arrives in the morning and leaves at night. Nothing unusual.
best I came up with was this
a map of places Tara spent most of her time.
forensics got carpet fibers from all these spots.
no matches.
what about that coworker of hers- Mr. Concerned?
I'll check him out.
Hey, Wonder Boy tells me you guys are trying to help a kid.
indeed, Detective, which is why I need your help.
I'm looking for a needle in a haystack
one suspicious 911 call out of 30, 000.
30, 000?
that's not a haystack. That's a whole damn farm.
using probabilities, I was able to reduce that number.
for instance, 38% of all calls to the 911 system are the result of unintended pressure to the keypad.
wait a minute. You're telling that 911 gets over 11, 000 butt dials a day?
I'm afraid so, but it did allow me to weed out almost half of the calls.
I also removed purse-snatchings, stalled cars
let's cut to the chase. How many calls we gonna look at?
312 in the next five minutes.
I'm sending you your half of the list.
the attachment contains audio files, along with each phone's number, call history, and the map of its location data.
156 calls in five minutes? Happy hunting, Detective.
no, it's gotta be version 10. 6, okay?
no, I told you. If the protocols don't match, the router won't work.
well... try again.
Hey, Todd, you got a minute?
one of my trainees yanked too hard on a monitor cable, tore the connector right off.
you have a spare? When will they learn to respect the tech?
keep an eye on that one.
now get that key fob.
better hurry, or you're gonna get caught.
here you go.
Thanks.
you okay, Sandra?
rough call.
time is running out, Detective. Let me know if you find that 911 call.
he's stealing from me every day!
it's my newspaper!
breaking everything in the house.
this is how it gets whenever the Knicks lose, and I've had it.
911. What's your emergency?
it's my fault. I was wrong. I shouldn't have slept with him.
now he hurt me. Honey, where are you?
I see your phone moving west on Highway 25. We- we were driving.
I said I was leaving him. He- he hurt me.
okay, I've got police coming to find you.
just stay with me. You're on a prepaid cell, so I can't see your name.
wanna tell me your name?
Hello? Are you there? Answer me.
please answer me. Wait a minute.
this caller's phone has been in the same locations as the rookie's homicide victim.
Hey, Glasses, I think I found the call.
and if I'm right, we're working the same case.
homicide victim. She called from a burner phone.
battery went dead before police could locate her.
but I'm pretty sure I know her name. I'm sending you the info now.
Tara Cooke. - Yeah.
I'm betting whoever's threatening that kid is the same person who killed Tara.
now is there any way you can access Tara's voice mail?
I'll try, Detective.
who is that? Who is helping you?
nobody. I swear I don't know that person.
I'm not a fan of lies, Sandra.
you broke one of my rules. - Please don't hurt Aaron.
you should've thought of Aaron before you involved someone else in our arrangement.
now I have no choice.
I'm a man of my word.
just remember, this was your fault.
911. What is your emergency?
would you like me to send an ambulance to your location?
an explosion. Are you sure? Where was the bomb when it went off, sir?
are you all right? Is anyone injured? - I understand, sir.
how many windows were shattered from the explosion?
and as far as you can tell, was anyone injured?
is he dead? Did you kill Aaron?
the bomb I exploded was in a parking garage.
three cars were turned into flaming metal husks.
call it a warning shot.
aaron is still alive... for the moment. Okay, I understand.
no, I don't think you do.
you see, a bomb of the exact same size is currently strapped to little Aaron.
and since my rules have proven too complicated for you to follow,
I'm gonna make this all very simple.
you have exactly 15 minutes to delete those calls before I set that bomb off, starting now.
do it!
or the next dispatch call you make will be to have officers pick up the pieces of what's left of that boy's body.
do you understand me now, Sandra?
at first, it didn't make sense.
of all the operators out there on that floor, why pick the one who is least likely to crack under pressure and give in to his demands?
a foolish move...
unless he knew something about you...
something in a sealed juvenile record that he could twist into the perfect leverage to get you to do what he was asking.
the loss of a child.
his name was Joseph.
he was three years old, and he had a smile that just made everything okay.
I lived across the street, used to babysit him all the time.
and one night, when I was 14, I was giving him a bath.
he wanted a toy. Ridiculous yellow frog.
it was just downstairs.
I was only gone a minute, but...
you can probably guess the rest.
the worst part wasn't...
desperately trying to perform CPR before the paramedics arrived or even when the police charged me with negligent homicide.
no, the worst part... was when I came back upstairs and I found him lying facedown in the tub.
I froze.
I couldn't think. I couldn't move.
and to this day, I wonder whether those extra 15 seconds wouldn't have saved Joseph's life.
you were just a child yourself. Anyone in those circumstances
that's what my lawyer said.
and in the eyes of the law,
I was found innocent.
but not in my eyes, Harold.
which is why I'm gonna do whatever this man wants. Sandra, wait.
there's a second reason why the caller is targeting you
a 911 call you took two days ago, a murder.
I don't care. I'm not giving up on another little boy.
I'll give you as many minutes as I can, and then I'm deleting those calls.
I'm turning around now. Please get out of my way.
I understand you won't give up on Aaron.
I won't give up on you.
ms. Shaw, if you still have those tethered phones, hold on to them.
I have work to do.
got a description. Might be the guy we're looking for.
all right, Shaw, let's hear it. Latino in a slick suit.
ridiculous number of piercings in his right ear, including a Gothic cross.
Templario.
why am I not surprised?
there he is.
five does seem a bit ridiculous. I'm on way.
no need to handle this on your own. Never been one to wait for backup.
just want a quick conversation with him.
the rest of you can... leave.
nobody gets hurt.
nobody gets hurt? How about you, pendejo?
I was kinda hoping you'd pick the hard way.
Hey, Glasses, got some interesting information about my homicide victim and her bosses, the Kincaids.
might help you with your kid. Call you when I'm done.
I just got one other question.
any idea what Tara has in her hand?
that's her cell phone.
that's her cell phone.
found in her apartment.
that is a burner phone.
Tara had it on her the night she died, but can't seem to find it in any of her things.
turns out somebody got rid of it...
somebody who killed her. We accessed the phone records.
Tara used that burner phone to only call two numbers
911 the night she died, and...
this one. Recognize it?
me neither. That's why we decided to check its voice mail.
I know, how do you do that without the code, right?
I got this friend of mine who's just
he's great at that type of thing.
Ron, it's Tara.
I- I can't do this anymore, the sneaking around.
it's not fair to me or to Gina.
I wanna tell the world about us.
even deleted voice mails can be retrieved for up to 30 days.
ones and zeros, they never really go away.
none of this is admissible in court.
but this is.
carpet fibers from the mat in your trunk, which is where Ron stuffed the body after he hid her... before he dumped her down by the river.
but the real scare came when you realized she made a 911 call.
you didn't know what was on that call, but you knew you needed to get rid of it.
see, normally, I'd let you squirm and deny it.
but you had to kidnap a little boy to cover it up.
little boy. What?
now you're gonna get on that phone, and you're gonna tell 'em to let him go.
wait. He was just supposed to get rid of the call.
he never said anything about- - Who?
who'd you hire? I don't know.
Ron told me what he'd done.
I found someone who could get rid of the problem.
how do you call it off? I never asked.
don't worry, Shaw.
I saved the best for last.
are you him...
the guy who's been terrorizing a 911 operator and threatening to blow up a kid?
no way, girl. You'll never catch him.
guy's careful. Untraceable calls, self-deleting texts.
we do what he asks, the money shows up in an account.
Yeah, I'm gonna make this simple.
you're gonna tell us where you're holding the boy.
no way. I'm a tomb.
you're going to have to shoot me.
that...
won't be necessary.
on their way, sir.
Mr. Reese, Ms. Shaw, I have news.
I was able to hack into the one cell phone tower relaying signals from both the tethered phones Ms. Shaw found.
I know where our mystery man is calling from.
chances are it's the same place they're holding Aaron- an office tower in midtown.
already there, Finch. The Templario gave up Aaron's location?
we managed to pry it out of him.
please be careful. The man we're looking for is highly intelligent, resourceful, and no doubt dangerous when cornered.
so basically, Finch, he's you...
if you were evil.
I hardly welcome the comparison, Ms. Shaw. Please hurry.
this man kidnapped a child to help a killer, and he'll succeed if Sandra deletes those calls.
what, you need a new suit?
stop.
I've just been informed that the clients who hired me for this job have confessed to the police.
as such, my contract with them is now null and void.
your services in this matter are no longer required, Sandra.
so it's over. You're letting Aaron go.
regretfully, that has now become impossible.
I simply cannot risk any details of this operation falling into police hands.
cleanliness is all.
don't blame yourself. You did everything you could.
don't do this, I'm begging you.
I'm sorry, Sandra. It's too late for Aaron.
and for you as well.
though of course eliminating you was always part of the plan.
it was a genuine pleasure speaking with you, Sandra.
good-bye.
don't. - It's protocol.
during a blackout, we're all supposed to exit through the front.
which is exactly what the man who called you will be waiting for.
is there another way out?
follow me.
vamonos. Let's go.
what the hell?
I thought the elevator was locked.
we gotta defuse that bomb.
Hey. There is no "Dead" in "Team.
so instead of going all Charles Bronson on me, let me clear that way.
you're Aaron, right?
I'm here to help.
there's an exit down there.
a level switch. Hold very still.
you like baseball, right?
Yeah, but I'm not a very good hitter. I used to have the same problem.
know what helped?
every night, I'd close my eyes...
imagine myself hitting one out of the park.
I realized it was all about timing.
wanna give it a try?
go ahead.
see that pitch coming, Aaron?
Yeah.
swing as hard as you can.
now.
I did it.
Yeah, you did. Got the last kidnapper.
you figure out which one was behind all this?
Yeah.
none of them. Then he's still out there.
don't move.
before you make a grave error of judgment, permit me to describe what I have in my hand.
it's a severed electrical cable connected to this generator.
current is running through it at ten times the amperage required for electrocution.
all I have to do is drop it in that water, and within three seconds, the muscles in your heart will fibrillate.
now I'm not a violent man.
but not only have you tried to harm this young woman and an innocent child, you have shut down a 911 call center in one of the more dangerous cities in the country.
so now there are two things that will keep me from ending your life right now.
first, I want you to drop the gun.
second, I need to hear the sound of your voice.
please. I just work for the guy.
I don't even know his name.
Sandra, get his weapon.
just wanted to say thanks again for all your help. The Kincaids have lawyered up.
but the carpet fibers in Ron's trunk are a match for the ones found on Tara's body.
so between that and the phone records, shouldn't be too hard to get a conviction.
Congratulations.
Yeah, you too.
I'd say we make a pretty good team. Don't you think?
we ain't a team.
what, are you gonna stand there all day?
get yourself a cup of coffee and get back to work.
I can't help you solve all your cases.
so glad you could meet.
I was on my way to work. It's the least I could do.
I owe you my life. I was happy to lend a hand.
to tell you the truth, I've come to think of us as kindred spirits, taking emergency calls to help those who need us.
so is that how you found me? You got a call?
something like that. What I mean to say is...
it does my heart good to know that you're out there.
likewise, Harold. I should get to work.
before you leave, there was... something I'd like to show you.
nice hit, Aaron. Is that him?
I wanted to offer you the one thing that 911 operators never get- closure.
aaron looks happy.
you'd never guess what he'd been through. Kids are resilient creatures.
as are adults, if they have the right friends.
my deepest thanks to both of you for a job well done.
well, not quite done.
if you still wanna find the guy, maybe these could help.
Hello? Finally.
a chance to speak to the man who handed me my first defeat.
I didn't do it alone.
Oh, believe me, I'm quite aware.
I'm warning you now, any attempt to harm either Sandra or Aaron again would be a mistake. No need to worry.
Sandra's earned her life, as far as I'm concerned. And at this point, harming Aaron would be counterproductive.
you, however, are another story entirely.
be seeing you.
what did he say?
nothing of any consequence.
when you find that one person who connects you to the world, you become someone different.
someone better.
when that person is taken from you...
what do you become then?
whatever he wanna do, you know?
what? Hmm?
Where'd you get that, in a cereal box?
huh? You wanna see a real gun?
forget you.
every little punk is carrying now, Anton.
that's why your father wanted us to take the car home.
relax.
we're picking up new hardware next week.
restore a little order.
besides, when we take the car, we don't get to meet new friends.
look at this guy.
you didn't bring enough for the whole group.
I have to teach you about sharing.
I'll need a statement from the bum. What hospital did they take him to?
he declined treatment. We got video on it, though.
you know, you could have done me a favor and let those guys land a couple more punches.
question for you.
looking at that tape,
I'd say you spent some time in the service.
but you don't learn how to fight like that in the regular army.
so what were you, special forces?
delta?
I'm Carter. You didn't give us a name.
you know, it's funny.
seems like the only time you need a name now is when you're in trouble.
so am I in trouble?
I don't know, you tell me.
you're the one living on the street.
Yeah, making that transition back can be tough.
some guys I knew got a little lost, needed a little help adjusting.
you need some help?
of course, some other guys I knew, they'd done so many evil things, they felt like they needed the punishment.
that sound more like your story?
excuse me for a second.
I'm here for my client.
your guy's prints were found in half a dozen crime scenes over the years.
open warrants in four different countries.
who you got down there, Carter, the angel of death?
I appreciate the help, counselor.
but who's picking up... The tab?
our employer wants to have a word with you.
do I owe you money?
cause I'm, uh...
running a little short at the moment.
you don't owe me anything, Mr. Reese.
that's the name you prefer, isn't it?
I know you've had several.
don't worry, I'm not gonna tell anybody about you.
you don't know anything about me.
I know exactly everything about you, Mr. Reese.
I know about the work you used to do for the government.
I know about the doubts you came to have about that work.
I know that the government, along with everybody else, thinks you're dead.
I know you've spent the last couple of months trying to drink yourself to death.
I know you're contemplating more efficient ways to do it.
so you see, knowledge is not my problem.
doing something with that knowledge...
that's where you'd come in.
and you can call me Mr. Finch.
I think you and I can help one another.
I don't think you need a psychiatrist or a support group, or pills...
what do I need?
you need a purpose.
more specifically, you need a job.
eight million people.
you know what they all have in common?
none of them knows what happens next.
someone is murdered in New York City every 18 hours.
at the end of the day, one of these people will be gone.
bad things happen to people every day.
you can't stop that.
what if you could?
not the things that happen in the heat of the moment.
but so many crimes are planned days, weeks in advance.
what if you could stop those?
I've got a list.
a list of people who are about to be involved in very bad situations.
murders, kidnappings.
the people that are on my list, they have no idea that anything's about to happen to them.
most of them are just ordinary people - like her. - Thank you.
her name is Diane Hansen, and this week she's at the top of my list.
I don't know exactly what's going to happen or what her role in it is.
she might be the victim. She could be the perpetrator.
all I know is that she's involved.
I want you to follow her, figure out what's gonna to happen, and stop it from happening.
so what do you think?
I think you're a bored rich guy.
I think that woman's probably your ex-wife or someone you rode in an elevator with once.
and either way, I think I'm done.
tonight police are looking for a homeless man for further questioning.
the unidentified man was originally believed to be the victim of a violent assault on the subway.
but now police consider the man a person of interest in a number of crimes nationwide.
Hey, sweetheart, what's wrong?
Jess, what's wrong?
you need to understand, Mr. Reese, the information I have is incomplete, but it's never wrong.
you need to know what it would be like to be forced to listen to someone get murdered, and not be able to do anything about it.
dot seven X-ray.
12 August, 2008. 1: 37 A. M.
too late.
this recording is three years old.
a woman murdered in this room by her husband.
for the insurance.
you were too late for her.
just like you were too late for your friend Jessica.
you were halfway around the world when she was killed.
what the hell do you know about it?
it's the truth. You left the government because they lied to you-- I never will.
I think all you ever wanted to do was protect people.
it's a wire-tap recording.
NSA or FISA. Government.
but you're not government.
no, I'm not.
I guess you could call me a concerned third party.
you couldn't have saved this woman...
or your friend.
but you could have if you had have known in time.
and that's the other thing I'm offering you, a chance to be there in time.
it's not too late for her.
you could help me stop what's about to happen.
the question is, will you?
what is this place?
the decline of Western civilization.
the city closed half its libraries.
budget cuts.
this building was sold to a bank that I control, which promptly declared bankruptcy.
so the property's in a kind of limbo.
it doesn't exist.
neither do you. I did a little digging.
I recognize, Mr. Reese, that there's a disparity between how much I know about you and how much you know about me.
I know you'll be trying to close that gap as quickly as possible.
but I should tell you I'm a really private person.
drivers licenses... Credit cards.
six cover identities.
funds to be replenished through a proxy corporation.
just like when you were with the agency.
when I was with the agency
I knew who was picking up the tab.
this is your list?
the list? Yeah.
but you don't get names, do you?
these are social security numbers.
and each of them map out to a violent crime.
and all of these numbers represent...
lost chances.
I could be a lot more help to you if you just tell me where you're getting these numbers.
it doesn't really matter where I get the numbers.
what you need to know is that the next number that's up is hers.
grew up in Detroit.
moved to the city after law school.
single.
she have any enemies? - One or two.
she's an assistant district attorney.
best conviction record in her department.
we have no idea when this bad thing might happen, huh?
could be in a week. Could be five minutes.
that's why we need to learn as much as we can about her.
how do you intend to begin?
the slow way.
cultivate a relationship to allow you to earn the asset's trust.
and the fast way?
first, you break into their home and go through all their stuff.
email, financial records, personal effects.
then you hack into their cell phone.
as long as it's charged and has signal, you can use the GPS to track them.
you can use the microphone to listen into their conversations whether they're talking on the phone or not.
Hi, mom. I'm sorry I haven't called you back...
third step
you need picture.
a wireless camera, and you can keep an eye on them from anywhere.
I know you're worried. I know. I'm fine.
it is a tough job, but I can look after myself.
you know that.
she's tough, but she's scared about something.
given Hansen's job, we've got hundreds of people who could be holding a grudge.
I cut the list to two.
the first is Wheeler, her co-counselor.
they dated for a few months last year.
she broke things off.
you got time to talk? Maybe I can buy you dinner.
I'm busy. Another time?
is something wrong? I've been noticing lately
no, I'm fine, thank you. Thanks.
and 40% of murders involve some kind of romantic relationship.
Wheeler's divorced. One kid.
partial custody, alimony. Career stalled.
the second person I'm looking into is Lawrence Pope.
the man Hansen is currently prosecuting.
Pope's on trial for killing his friends in a drug deal gone bad.
stole $12 million in cash.
Pope's gang may be targeting her for reprisal.
when we got there, the scene was colorful.
five dead.
one of them had managed to crawl ten feet to a phone to dial 911.
detective Fusco, when you interviewed Mr. Pope, what did he tell you in his defense?
he said that if he'd have shot the poor bastard, he would have shot him in the head.
Quote,"same as I always do," unquote.
he said he wouldn't have left him there half-dead, blubbering for his girlfriend.
no more questions, your honor.
detective...
you went a little off script in your testimony.
you never told me about that conversation, and it could clear Pope's name.
what's it matter? We got the guy.
it matters because it's my job to make absolutely sure that the wrong people don't go to jail. Do you remember?
excuse me, I thought we were on the same team.
something's gone wrong with her case.
hansen's on the move.
she's phoning county lockup, arranging a meeting with Pope...Alone.
isn't my lawyer supposed to be here for this?
I can call him if you want, but the reason I'm here is
I don't think you murdered those people.
I think somebody else was in the house when that 911 call was made.
somebody who told you what was said, which means you weren't there.
is it somebody you're trying to protect?
you gonna help me? Is that it?
the person who knows what happened that night must be somebody you care about.
is it your younger brother Michael?
Pope's got a brother. It's in his case file.
got it.
did he see the real killers? You should leave this alone, lady.
I can do the time.
these people are evil, killing when they want.
and they're protected from on high.
you keep asking questions, they'll kill me and my brother, and probably you too.
whoever these people are, you can trust me.
we'll take care of you and your brother.
if the killers are out there, I'm gonna find them, whether you help me or not.
it's my job. Now, why don't you
bitch, you keep your damn mouth shut, or I'll shut it for you!
I'm fine.
okay. She's okay. She's okay.
Finch, you were right about Hansen.
whoever framed Pope will be coming after her, and only Pope's brother Michael knows who they are.
Hi, mom, it's Jessica.
I'm just down in Mexico with Cindy, and I'll be back tomorrow. Okay?
talk soon. Bye. - Cindy?
Yeah.
I look like a Cindy? - Yeah.
I didn't tell her about us yet.
it's been six months.
I wish this weekend could go on forever.
it already has. It's Tuesday.
Yes, which means that you have to go back to the base, and I'm not gonna see you again for two weeks, which I hate.
then ask me to stay, and I will.
I'll quit. I'll quit.
okay. - I'll quit.
then quit. - I already did.
what? - Yeah.
I didn't want to take the chance that you wouldn't be here when I got back.
but first, we need some more Tequila.
Estamos recibiendo informes que unos aviones se han estrellado contra las dos torres gemelas del World Trade Center en Manhattan.
Hey, sweetheart, what's wrong?
Jess...What's wrong?
uh, it's New York. I don't know. I don't know.
something's happened this morning.
is it a plane crash?
I think it's two. I think it's two planes.
all right, thanks.
you went to see Pope last night?
Yeah. I gave him one more chance to turn in his accomplice, cut a deal.
he give you anything? No. As usual.
I'm, uh-- I'm late.
she's trying to track down Pope's brother Michael.
he can ID the real killers.
and she's stonewalling Wheeler.
what, does she think he's involved?
remember, Pope said they were protected from on high.
wait a second.
turns out there's a good reason she doesn't trust Wheeler.
he might be working with the killers.
and they're after Michael Pope.
we better get to this kid before someone else does.
Michael...Can I talk to you for a second?
I've got a message from your brother.
you don't know my brother. - Not exactly.
but I know what you saw. I'm not the only one looking for you.
you need to come with me.
Hey! Hey, help me.
Hey, this man is trying to put me in a taxi cab with him!
he's trying to take pictures of me.
what's going on? How you doing?
michael Pope's still on the subway.
when he comes up for air, you can use the GPS on your phone to find him.
if Pope's right about these guys,
I'm gonna need a hell of a lot more than a cell phone.
about that, I don't like firearms very much.
well, neither do I, but if someone has to have them, I'd rather it was me.
besides, my friend from the subway has a line on some.
lightly used.
steep discount.
pop, what about this one?
are you planning on buying that one?
I was just showing it to-- Put it back on the table before somebody else kicks your ass.
have you guys seen the men's room?
Hey, Anton.
good to see you again. You know this guy?
wow, that's some pretty serious equipment.
have you guys taken a safety course?
take you, for instance.
you're holding that thing sideways.
you can't aim it, and two, it'll eject a shell casing right into your face.
see?
I'm gonna hold on to these while you guys get some more practice.
have a nice day.
who the hell was that?
I got a signal from your phone.
tell me you found Michael Pope.
he's the only one who knows who's coming after Hansen.
I found him, but somebody else found him first.
listen.
Oh, Mikey.
you were gonna tell him all about us.
weren't you? Hmm? Head uptown.
are you hearing this?
97th and riverside.
step on it.
we're gonna put a couple in the back of his head.
make it look like a gang thing.
you gotta do something.
relax.
I'm on it.
keep the change.
you're crazy.
we're both dead now.
do you know who they are?
I do now.
cops. Come on.
what exactly have you gotten me into? I don't know.
that's the whole point.
I hired you to help me figure that out.
here.
I think we're up against a group of corrupt cops.
stills is narcotics.
him and his men get word of deals.
they steal the drugs, the cash, and they kill all the witnesses.
and they get Fusco to frame up guys like Lawrence Pope for the murders.
exactly.
I think their next target is Hansen.
but I don't know for certain.
hell, I don't know anything for certain, because you won't tell me where you're getting your information.
when the towers came down, you were in a hotel in Mexico.
I was here.
I was working.
didn't even know about the attacks until that evening.
you see, Mr. Reese, until that day,
I had spent the better part of my life making myself very rich.
suddenly all that money didn't seem to amount to much.
after the attacks, the government gave itself the power to read every email, listen to every cell phone, but they needed something that could sort through it all, something that could pick the terrorists out of the general population before they could act.
the public wanted to be protected.
they just didn't want to know how they were being protected.
so when they finally got a system that worked, they kept it secret.
so how do you know about it?
I built it.
but there was a problem with this machine.
I had built it to prevent the next 911.
but it was seeing all sorts of crimes.
so I had to teach the machine to divide the things it saw into two lists:
relevant and irrelevant.
events that would cause massive loss of life were relevant, so those would be passed along to the NSA or the FBI.
and the irrelevant information?
every night at midnight, the machine erases it.
it was only later that I realized my mistake.
that irrelevant list was eating away at me.
so where's the machine now?
what, the drives? Who knows?
government facility somewhere.
but the machine?
the machine is everywhere.
watching us with 10, 000 eyes.
listening with a million ears.
what did I tell you about sending email? Three weeks, you could practically move in.
never put anything in an email you cannot own.
you gave yourself a way to communicate with it?
I was building the government a tool of unimaginable power.
I thought maybe an off switch would come in handy.
so I built myself a back door into it.
to access the irrelevant list.
just a social security number.
if anyone ever found out, I'd lose access so...
nine digits, that's all we get.
and we have no idea why it picked Diane Hansen.
it wouldn't be steering us toward her if it wasn't seeing something.
but I don't know if I can protect Hansen.
I can't see the whole picture.
I offered you a job, Mr. Reese.
I never said it would be easy.
Hey, Carter. - Yeah?
you hear about your pal Anton? No.
him and his father tried to buy some guns.
wound up getting shot with their own merchandise.
are they dead? Nope. Embarrassed enough.
they got taken out by one guy. In a suit.
Reese? I have bad news.
lawrence Pope was stabbed to death last night in his cell.
what?
they're trying to cover their tracks.
hansen must be next.
you wanted to meet?
Remsen and Avenue D in Canarsie. 20 minutes.
it's happening now.
Hello?
are you here?
Hello?
Hello?
are you gonna keep me waiting, Stills? We don't have time for this.
what's your problem? Pope is dead.
the problem is Wheeler.
you idiot, he knows.
he knows about Pope and-- and maybe even some of the others.
I can take care of the files at the office, but you have to take care of Wheeler.
tonight.
Hey, look what I found.
we got ourselves a groupie.
heavily armed, too.
you know this guy? No.
you're not law enforcement.
cartel finally grow some stones? Send somebody to take care of us?
who the hell are you?
concerned... Third party?
take care of him.
and, uh, get rid of Wheeler tonight.
make it look clean.
Hey, Stills.
you screw this up, I won't let it get to me.
I'll take care of you just like I took care of Pope.
I can look after myself.
you know that.
nice spot.
it's oyster bay.
glad you like it.
you're gonna be here a long, long time.
I'm curious.
was there a point where you knew you'd become a bad guy?
woke up one morning, realized I was paid to guard a bunch of jerks from wall street who were robbing everybody blind.
they're stealing more than my annual salary in a afternoon.
so I said,"what the hell?
I don't believe you.
see, I've been watching you, Lionel.
your heart's not really into it. Now, Stills, he does it for money.
but I think you do it because you're loyal.
what's the difference?
it's why I'm gonna let you live.
Yeah, I'm considering sticking around New York for a while.
if I do, I'm gonna need someone on the inside, and you might come in handy.
Ah, so I'm working for you now, huh? That's right.
but I've got two rules.
one, you so much as hurt anybody, and I'll kill you.
I don't particularly like killing people, but I'm very good at it.
and two...
you have to be more careful.
for instance, if you're gonna put someone in the backseat of your car, you have to search them properly.
no, please. What are you doing?
you have your vest on, officer?
Yeah.
where the hell have you-- There's no time. We were wrong.
hansen isn't the target. She's the ringleader.
they're going after Wheeler. Tonight.
Wheeler's up there.
he heads to the gym most nights.
I got Doyle upstairs staking him out.
the place is a dump. There's no doorman, no cameras, nobody.
we'll take him in the lobby.
soon as it's done, we take the shooter out.
give him a block and then take him out. Head shots this time, you understand?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
get our friend out of the trunk.
who is this guy?
some ex-con Wheeler put away.
Azarello, lights.
Doyle, talk to me.
he's coming out now.
come on, Henry, let's go.
wait.
show me that basketball of yours. Let's go, come on.
damn, he's got his kid with him. What a waste.
Henry, watch out.
you're about to kill a man...
and his son.
please.
please don't do this.
drop your weapon.
that isn't true actually.
if you keep working on it, if you keep throwing the ball like that, you'll be able to throw that fast.
Really? - Absolutely.
let him go.
I can't do that.
I let him go, my friends and I go to jail.
drag your friend outside and take him to the hospital.
right now.
I think I kill you and your friend here.
make it look like you killed each other.
then, just because you pissed me off...
I'm gonna kill your family.
and all your friends.
I don't have any friends.
I don't have any family left either.
went around the world looking for bad guys.
but there were plenty of you right here all along.
so now, essentially, you're telling us you couldn't see what was happening in the parking lot at all.
I'm done, your honor.STILLS WHERE ARE YOU?
ms. Hansen?
the state isn't paying you by the hour, counselor.
why don't we have the defendant tell you in her own words?
let's listen to the 911 call she made.
and hey, take care of Wheeler. Tonight.
make it look clean. And Stills?
you screw this up, I won't let it get to me.
I'll take care of you just like I took care of Pope.
I can look after myself.
you know that.
you ready to get to work, officer?
I'm no good to you.
I'm dead.
just a matter of time before the gangs get me.
or I. A.
no one knows you're involved. I took care of that.
besides, they'll be too busy looking for Stills.
the police will think he's run for it.
the gangs and the mob will think he's gone Witness Protection.
is that where he is, Witness Protection?
no, Lionel. He's in the trunk.
only problem is, uh... Um...
I had to shoot him with your gun.
and you'd have a hard time explaining that one, so...
you'll be taking another trip.
and I'm not coming along this time.
where am I going? Oyster bay.
where no one's gonna find him for a long, long time.
I'll be in touch.
you have a decision to make.
the machine gave you another number.
the numbers never stop coming.
you should know that up front.
why me?
I've been watching you for a long time, John.
we have more in common than you might think.
the world thinks we're both dead, for starters.
you programmed the machine to delete those irrelevant numbers.
now you're trying to save them.
what changed your mind?
let's just say you're not the only one that's lost someone.
if you wanna leave,
I'll give you enough money to get as far as you need.
disappear.
and if I stay?
sooner or later both of us'll probably wind up dead.
actually dead this time.
I said I'd tell you the truth.
didn't say you'd like it.
start talking, officer. You think I'm gonna rat on my friends?
please.
you can tell the d. A. All about your crooked pals.
I wanna know about him. The guy who came after you.
I don't know anything. It was just some guy alone in a suit.
Yeah, well, you're gonna tell me everything that ????????????
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system.
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I know because I built it.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but, it sees everything.
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
people like you.
crimes that the government considered irrelevant.
they wouldn't act, so I decided I would.
but I needed a partner.
someone with the skills to intervene.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you'll never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
good morning, Finch.
don't you knock?
not if I can help it.
I felt bad about blowing your cover identity.
been looking for a new job for you.
dog walker, maybe. Or concert pianist?
I have a job, Mr. Reese, and so do you.
the machine has sent us a new number.
his name's Joey Durban, a soldier in the 107th infantry, just back from Afghanistan.
army commendation medal, purple heart-- Guy was a fighter.
just like you.
I fought beside the 107th in Iraq. Most of them were just kids.
joined up because they lost family or friends when the towers came down.
over there, they grew up fast. Or they died.
well, at least Joey came home alive.
and now you can help him stay that way.
he works as a doorman at a building in midtown.
I'm on it.
standard operating procedure
I'll clone his phone for voice and texts.
I'll start following him.
and, uh, Finch... If you're going to work all night, you should try getting some exercise.
you look fabulous, Mrs. J.
I'd ask you out myself, but I'd have to fight off Larry Segel.
thank you.
hello.
Robbie, I got to take off early.
Joey's engaged to a girl named Pia Moresco.
she waited six years for him while he was deployed.
Yeah, come here.
I love you, Joey.
Hey, Finch. Finch, are you there?
Yes. Is there a problem?
what are you doing? Nothing.
thought you said you'd never lie to me.
what's the problem, Mr. Reese? Our guy, Joe Durban...
I've been on him for eight hours, and all he's done is open doors for old ladies, and now he's going window shopping.
if the machine's given us his number, he must be caught up in something.
he got a text, it's a bit garbled.
sending it over.
head down. 50 seconds!
head down. Don't look at me.
40 seconds!
not a good idea, pal.
30 seconds!
wrap it up!
10 seconds, Sierra. Move!
sierra, move!
enough!
I'm back, Mr. Reese. I've deciphered that text-- It's a street address...
for a bank.
no kidding, Finch.
what I said about our guy being boring
I take it back.
ladies and gentlemen, please do not leave bags unattended. Unattended bags will be...
I didn't know you were back from over there.
I'm not. I'm just...
heading back, actually. - Where's your uniform? - Uh...
I got a new job.
one of those jobs you can't talk about?
so our friend Joey's a bank robber.
is that why the machine gave us Joey's number?
I built the machine to look for lethal intent.
armed robbery wouldn't normally make the cut.
either way, I say we gift wrap him and give him to the NYPD before someone winds up dead.
Finch, the guy was a good soldier.
let me at least find out how he got into this mess.
okay, but don't let your personal feelings warp your judgment.
no one forced him to go robbing banks.
hang on, hang on. He's meeting someone.
he's giving her something.
looks like money-- A lot of money.
so... Who's the other woman?
I don't know her name yet.
bank robber and a cheet.
unlikely to have a happy ending.
do you think he's targeting one of the women? - Could be.
only way I'm going to find out is to get closer to Joey, and that won't be easy.
these guys are organized and ultra-cautious.
no unnecessary contact.
Thanks.
hang on.
that cabbie was at the bank.
just made their courier.
Finch, run a check on cab medallion number 5-Victor-80.
driver's name is Willis, also an ex-soldier in the 107th infantry.
same unit as Joey.
and also a bank robber.
I hacked the taxi company website.
before he dropped the cash off with Joey,
Willis stopped at a bar in Coney Island called the Green Zone.
bar's owned by former master Sergeant Sam Latimer, veteran of the First Gulf War.
I think you just found the gang's ringleader.
I want to get close to Latimer.
and I'll need a cover story. I'll get on that.
and I need you to create a vacancy for me...
with the gang.
I'll get on that too.
anything else? No, that'll do for now.
you Sam Latimer?
name's Tony Miller.
marine buddy down in San Diego, told me a while back, if I was ever in New York,
I should look you up. What's your buddy's name?
Hector Murez.
not good.
ran over an IED in Hellmans.
lasted a whole week before he hit room temperature.
rest in peace. Tough son of a bitch.
so...
what kind of work are you looking for? Security?
I'm not looking for wages.
I'm only interested in lump sums.
you in trouble? That's my business.
you're making it mine.
I was working freelance in Tijuana.
job went South. People's feelings got hurt.
I need to put some distance between me and them.
I've got some experience you could use-- Skills.
what kind of skills?
you have a . 45 under the counter, a shotgun next to the register, and I can get to them both before you.
so if you're such a hotshot, what do you need me for?
I prefer to work with people who know the area.
I heard you're good at what you do
you make a lot of money... You're still alive.
and that's because I prefer not to work with a man whose only reference is a dead marine.
well...
there's no job openings at the moment.
but I'll call around.
Thanks. You won't regret it.
I know.
Hey, uh, keep the change. Let me get my case out of the trunk.
yellow cab driver, get out of your vehicle!
get out of your vehicle! Now!
we got weapons here-- Shotgun, submachine guns.
I don't know anything about those.
those are not mine!
you Carter?
Yeah. - Molina-- Robbery.
I hear you're chasing after some mysterious special forces guy.
Yeah, what is it to you?
come here. I may have something for you.
his prints showed up on a bank job yesterday.
on a bank job?
Yeah. Four armed guys knocked over a bank on Houston.
see that guard there?
tries to be a hero. Someone stops him from getting his head blown off.
when CSU did elimination prints they printed the guard's holster.
it was your mystery man. Well, did they stop him? Interview him?
no, he slipped away before the first units got there.
of course.
see the way these guys are moving?
Yeah, and I'm pretty sure that's a milspec radio.
they're soldiers.
so your special forces guy fits right in.
I mean, he-- He could be their inside man.
mind if I keep this?
looks like your taxi ride paid off, Finch.
Latimer just called me.
he wants me to meet the team...Tonight.
come on. Move, move.
what we got, Straub? - ID checks out. Pay-as-you-go cell phone bought two days ago. Ran the calls-- Mainly take-out, couple to some jarheads in San Diego. Last call's from Latimer.
what the hell is this about? I thought Latimer wanted you to meet me.
he also told us to put a bullet in your head if we didn't like you. And right now, we don't.
I'm just an ex-soldier, needs some money fast.
you don't trust me? Fine.
but the 107 trusted me back in '05, in Tikrit, and I trusted them.
how the hell do you know our unit?
big fella's got it tattooed all over his arm.
you don't call us. We call you.
when we do...
you lose that phone.
killing in battle, in combat, is one thing.
killing someone up close...
someone who can't fight back, that takes a different sort of killer.
and Joey's not one of them.
so you think Joey's the target. Then who's gunning for him?
one of the gang? One of the women?
do we even know why he's such a mess?
he's got a job, pretty girlfriend, good service record-- He's throwing it all away. He's going to end up in prison.
or dead. - You're right, but, nor every ex-soldier meets a reclusive billionaire.
okay. But if Joey's bad choices mean he's about to walk into a bullet, we have to find out who's firing it.
excuse me.
Hey. - I'm looking for my girlfriend.
what are you doing here?
just wanted to say hello to the most beautiful girl in the world.
you're gonna get me in trouble. Good tips today?
not bad.
Julie's out sick, so I got her tables.
it's been busy.
you better get back to your shift.
okay. Oh, before you go, Realtor says she can shome some apartments tonight.
I'd really like it if you can see them with me.
things are kind of difficult at work right now.
I know, baby, but this is important too.
I just want us to do stuff together again.
like have fun. Remember that?
I'm trying, P. I really am.
John, I didn't know you were back from over there.
Where's your uniform? - Uh...
I got a new job. One of those jobs you can't talk about?
Oh, yeah, I got engaged.
I'm-- I'm moving back east next month.
his name's Peter.
Peter. He's a lucky guy.
I waited for you.
I didn't ask you to. - No.
no, you didn't.
you just...Left.
because you thought you'd get killed over there, and that that would hurt me.
but I think the truth is that it was easier for you to be alone.
that's one of the things you learn over there
in the end, we're all alone.
and no one's coming to save you.
be happy with Peter.
Oh, Molina, I want to know more about this gang.
they pulled about a dozen robberies.
they hit banks, jewelry stores, money exchanges, casinos. It's always four armed men.
they haven't killed anyone. They haven't even hurt anyone.
in and out in 60 seconds, every time.
dozen robberies. They're good. - Oh, yeah.
a gang like this, they usually implode after four or five.
you know how they start dropping money, they have a falling out with each other?
not these guys. Maybe this will help.
it's a 148 radio-- Painted black, aerial cut down to look more like a phone.
it uses frequency-hopping spread spectrum.
which means zero chance of interception.
you know this how?
I used them In Iraq and Afghanistan.
where do I get one of these? You can't.
got to steal them from the military.
I checked with every base on the east coast.
fort Drum reported the theft of a radio package six months ago.
do they got any idea who stole them?
army CID investigated-- No joy.
I'll tell you what you can do.
cross-check guys resident in New York, who left the service out of Fort Drum in the last six months. 12 robberies
must have some physical descriptions.
how was school?
Thanks.
Hi, sweetie. Hey, Finch. I'm sending you a photo.
looks like Joey's other woman's got a little girl.
think she's Joey's?
sure looks like that.
you should be able to find the girl's name, if Sunny Days Kindergarten's firewalls aren't too tough for you.
and why don't you arrange a little face-time with Joey,
Mr. Reese?
I thought you said no contact.
what are you doing? Following me?
I live here, pal. What's your excuse?
I'm staying in a fleapit on Colby.
this one's on me...
but I'm, uh, running a little low on funds.
how long before we get some action?
that's up to Latimer.
we just follow orders.
orders-- Don't you ever get sick of them?
maybe. But they make life simple.
told to go down that road, you go down that road.
Yeah, you're told to go into that bank, you go into that bank, right?
I don't know, man.
six years, all I thought about
dreamed about was coming home.
finally I come home and there's nothing.
there's no money, no jobs
bankers gone and lost it all.
robbed the country blind. I mean, it's like, what the hell are we fighting for, you know?
joke's on us.
you guys were soldiers, right?
what like Iraq, Afghanistan? Some serious stuff.
Yeah, but you volunteered. Nobody asked you to go.
it's not like the country owes you a living.
we got it, pal. - No.
you don't got it
talking about bankers, like you know anything.
it's not been easy for us either.
really sorry about that, but we're talking here.
Hey, so are we.
guys like you got to adapt.
it's the knowledge economy now.
time to use this, my friend.
okay.
all right, come on. Let's go. Sorry, Bill.
what made you start on the banks?
realized the job that I had wasn't going to allow me to do the things that I wanted.
I had a debt to pay.
money? - More like an obligation.
you got kids?
no.
why do you say that? I was just asking.
what about the rest of the guys? They got debts too?
Straub does.
gambling.
is that why Straub's so jumpy?
you'd be jumpy too, you got blown up twice.
listen, man, I got to get to work.
wait for the call.
any luck ID'ing that woman?
kindergarten records say the girl is Amy Myles, daughter of Stacey Myles.
father's name not given.
I'm checking hospital records. What about you?
I'm going to check on someone else
a guy named Straub.
Strauby, what gives? We made you nearly 80 grand last job.
I got five-- It's not enough.
well, you know how it is. I had to clean the money.
that's a big, heavy discount right there.
now, you guys made 20 grand-- I made less than than that.
people I owe, they're going to take away my mom's apartment.
they said one of the paper's I signed, - It gives them the right. - Man, I told you - to stay away from the sharks.
Yeah, well, I didn't have much choice then, did I? I need more money.
listen, I got a job for you...
tonight. Now, if you do this right, there's a big score coming down-- - 400 grand big. - You're kidding.
big client, big job.
200 for me and 200 for you.
Yeah, 200 divided four ways.
come here. Come on.
my friend, how you divvy up is your business.
with this job, you can pay off all your debt...
you remember Danny Platt?
Manny Santos? Guys worked hard-- Did what they were told.
and now they're enjoying their retirement.
say we don't make it out of one of these jobs.
say we take casualties.
still the same split, right? 50/50 with you?
sure.
but you guys are going to make it out.
you're a unit-- Team.
Hey, Carter. I followed up on your radio lead.
Teddy Dalloway-- 6'2," 220 pounds, discharged from the army five months ago.
a big guy, but that's not what gave him away.
he's left-handed.
Yep, we've got a GPS lock on his phone. See if he leads us to the rest of the gang.
uh, look, if, uh, Teddy makes a move, you call me. I don't care what time.
Hey, Finch, just got the call. Gang's picking me up.
get told the target en route.
you're not going in with them? Got to watch Joey's back.
don't trust his friend Straub one bit.
I did not understand "infiltrate the gang" to mean - join them in their robberies. - No choice.
I'll keep the line open. Monitor the police band for me.
here.
why the heavy artillery?
target's a mob gambling joint, 445 Mulvaney.
people inside guaranteed to be packing.
ETA, 60 seconds. Phones off, batteries out, radio comms only.
Hey. - Tracked Teddy Dalloway's GPS.
he left Brooklyn 20 minutes ago, in some kind of vehicle.
he did three pick-ups. It's the gang. Know where they're heading?
somewhere around here.
get back against the wall!
against the wall! Put the money down!
back against the wall! Back! Back! Go! Go!
gonna call back up. - Do that.
back! Back! Back! Back!
put it down!
put the money down! Down! - Reese, NYPD dispatch.
just received a back up call for that address.
John, NYPD is on route.
do you hear me? - We got to move out!
cops are coming! - How the hell do you know?
police band. They have our address.
we gotta move. Leave the money.
move! Move!
everyone over! - Move across!
I don't hear any damn cops!
we left like 100 grand up there! Hear 'em now, Straub?
damn lucky for us he was listening in. Come on, let's go. This way.
let's move.
nobody move!
I don't know what happened-- We hardly got in there before the cops were on us.
Joey and the new guy, they said to leave the money.
Yeah, how thoughtful of them.
you guys let me down, Straub. Well, I'll make it up to you.
you got to give us another chance, all right?
okay, one more-- The big one.
can you tell me what it is? In good time.
and keep an eye on the new guy.
you might need him going in-- Not sure you're going to need him coming out.
I want to find out what his guilt trip is.
try to cure him of it.
might be more complicated than you think.
I got into Joey's bank accounts
last four months, he's paid nearly $10, 000 into a 529 savings plan for the little girl, Amy Myles.
it'll pay for her to go to college.
Amy has to be Joey's kid.
but she's not. Hospital records show that her daddy was called Frank Stephens.
was.
killed in Afghanistan.
he was a soldier in the 107th. Same unit as Joey.
we're going to meet in five hours.
it's a new job.
you're going to risk it all again?
you know Straub's going off the rails.
well, yeah. That's why I gotta have his back.
he needs the money.
uh, Straub might. But you don't.
Yeah, I do.
that's right...
your obligation.
what is that?
you leave someone behind?
who was it, Joey?
a friend.
took my place on patrol.
got killed.
why'd he take your place?
lt puts me on honor guard for this visiting politician...
so I'm scrubbing my boots, and Frank-- That was his name-- Frank goes out.
his wife had just had a baby.
this little girl called Amy.
he was so happy, he said nothing could hurt him.
ied rips him to pieces in the seat I should have been sitting in.
so that's your debt?
Yeah. He used to show me her picture, you know?
he was going to lay the world at her feet, man.
was going to give her money for college, everything.
and he would have done that too. He would have done it.
and that's what you're going to do.
you tell anyone else?
no, not even my girlfriend.
so you're still fighting the war.
she's still waiting.
when this is done...
I'm with her completely.
be with her now.
don't do the job.
my friend got killed.
got to take care of his kid.
it's Pia, right?
Yeah.
you're even prettier than Joey said.
you're a friend of Joey's?
army. Just in New York for a few days.
he's crazy about you, you know that?
it's funny how his friends know more about what he's feeling than I do.
well, you know, Joey's a...
bit of a closed book.
you're telling me.
starting to wonder if he's ever going to let me in.
waited six years for him to come home, and it's like he's still over there.
sorry.
shouldn't go crying all over the customers.
no, no, no, no, no, no. It's all right.
look, you're a beautiful woman.
if Joey doesn't come to his senses, plenty more fish in the sea.
no, I'm stuck with him. Loved him since I was so high.
that's the way it is.
are you there, Mr. Reese?
get anywhere with your friend, Joey?
no. Can't cure someone of guilt.
soon as I find out what the next job is, go ahead and call the cops.
they can pull the whole gang in. You did what you could.
Yep.
I got something for you.
Ex-soldiers-- Manny Santos, Danny Platt.
both murdered. Shot in the head.
this is from three months ago. What made you look at it?
I cross-checked CSU reports for the last six months
military hardware items.
and look what came up
148 radio. Serial number still legible.
one of the radios stolen from Fort Drum.
it means Santos and Platt were robbers too.
it explains why your gang keeps going, why they don't fall out.
once they've done four or five jobs, someone bumps them off, recruits some new suckers.
Yeah, but who?
they have the target, sir.
long-term evidence lockup under Centre Street.
they have the cage number, precise orders to recover the item.
security's light-- Four semi-retired cops.
bad news-- It's right on Centre Street.
it's crawling with cops and feds. What are we stealing?
one item only.
easily concealed, so even you boy scouts won't make me leave it behind.
Yeah, but what is it? Bonds? Jewelry?
don't know, don't care, but it's worth 400 grand.
what about exit strategy?
uh, that's in hand, sir. Boss says no loose ends.
understood? - Understood.
the team was cracking up anyway. It's time to refresh.
Latimer gave us clean weapons.
I want cell phones, pagers, in here.
come on.
Yeah, even your sneaky little earwig.
Hey, it's not a problem, is it?
get up! Get up!
right now! Get up! Put your hands behind your back! Move! Move! Move!
move.
I called from Marmostein Ribner
some probate issues on the Ulman Estate.
have you got a case number?
hands in the air! This is a robbery!
get out here, now! Move! Move it! You too.
go! Move! Move! Move!
move! Get on the ground!
watch the entrance. Watch the door.
you... stop staring at me. - Leave him.
not a problem.
I said stop looking at me.
Latimer set you up. It's a trap.
sit down. Wait here.
8-2-5-7-7-3, this is it. - All right, pull it.
pull it. Pull it.
Latimer screwed us.
we got to get out of here. Won't let you pull that crap again.
got it! 8-7-3-3-6.
now move. This is a trap.
how do you know, maybe you're the trap.
point that thing at me again, and I'll shoot you with it.
let's move.
we got it. Let's move.
let's go.
keep moving Teddy, I got you.
Carter, I just got a call of a shooting at Centre Street, evidence lock.
who called it in?
street cleaners saw four guys go into the lockup, five minutes later, shooting started.
same four guys came running out.
getting you to the van, Teddy. Come on.
take him in the van. I'll cover you.
there you go.
did you get it?
you're a good soldier, Strauby.
run!
damn weapon won't fire.
why didn't my weapon fire? Latimer must have ground down the firing pins.
come on. Let's go.
the lockup's secured.
as soon as the police ID Straub or Teddy, they'll be on to you.
you got to get out of the city.
go South or west.
here's a couple of grand to keep you going.
with your skills, you'll find work. But go now.
and don't look back.
I can't. I can't, man.
I have someone here.
you stay here, and you'll be looking at her from behind bars for 20 years.
call her and ask her to go with you.
she loves you, Joey.
just tell her it's gonna be you and her now.
just you and her.
can you hear me?
I think you can.
guess you're out there, hiding in plain sight.
I keep looking for you.
I keep finding myself in some bad situations.
you could always stop looking for me.
not an option. Now I've got two more bodies.
I don't think you killed those guys.
but I think you know who did.
I'll take care of it.
playing a dangerous game.
and I'm not sure I understand why.
I've got my reasons.
maybe you do.
but every killer I locked up thought they had a good reason.
and that is how this ends. Sooner or later, I'll lock you up.
or find you bleeding out somewhere.
I will take my chances.
I think I've told you everything that I can remember.
detective, over here.
looks like this is all they took.
so you let our bank robber get away.
he paid his dues, deserved a second chance.
then are we done?
not quite.
I hope that's what you wanted.
so we better talk money.
someone got here first.
he's dead.
any idea who did it?
the name on the evidence box was Elias.
that mean anything to you?
no.
I'd better look into it.
the truth is that, it was easier for you to be alone.
that's one of the things you learn over there.
in the end, we're all alone.
and no one's coming to save you.
be happy with Peter. You don't believe that.
not really.
you wanna be brave?
take a risk.
tell me to wait for you and...
say those words and I will.
it would take real courage, wouldn't it?
wait for me.
please.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system...
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I know, because I built it.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you,
crimes the government considered irrelevant.
they wouldn't act, so I decided I would.
but I needed a partner... someone with the skills to intervene.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if you're number's up, we'll find you.
yeah?
we've got a problem.
what's good here?
that won't work, Mr. Reese.
what won't?
your interrogation technique.
what's good here?
it's an innocent question.
no question is ever innocent from you.
you're trying to determine whether I come here often.
armed with that knowledge, you'll try to figure out where I live.
you're paranoid, Finch.
with good reason.
maybe I just don't know what's good here so I'm asking the regular.
enjoy your meal, Mr. Reese.
the next number on your list.
bus is here!
so what do we have on him?
born in south boston. Law degree from nyu.
he lives on the upper west side with his son, Sam.
Where's the wife?
she died last year.
any chance Gates was involved?
not unless he found a way to give her cancer.
Elizabeth Gates, local philanthropist, dies at 38
Elizabeth Gates was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last april.
by november she was gone.
so the son is all he has left.
wait! - Oh, don't forget your lunch.
what do we know about the nanny?
gates hired her when his wife fell ill.
the kid sure likes her.
she spends a lot of time with him.
judging by the hours she's billing,
I'd say Gates was putting in long days at the office.
he lost the woman he loved.
probably threw himself into his work to cope.
Where's his office?
criminal court, city of new york.
which may explain why the machine has sent us his social.
absolutely not.
this is direct evidence, properly obtained.
so odds are he's the victim, not the perpetrator.
judges get plenty of death threats.
it doesn't pass the balancing test, your honor.
the probative value is...
I know what the balancing test is, counselor.
gates gets more death threats than most.
word at the courthouse is he's waging a one-man war on crime...
tough, by-the-book, making lots of enemies.
if video of the actual crime is unfairly prejudicial,
I think we might have to give up on the entire concept of trial by jury.
the video's in.
everyone has enemies.
the machine identifies malice and an intent to harm.
we need to determine which threat it saw, which one is real.
until we know, my best bet is to stay close to gates, in case somebody makes a move.
looks like he's got quite a collection of enemies.
Mr. Reese, any sign of a threat?
does cholesterol count?
I'm nearly done analyzing the threatening letters.
there are nine that I still can't source, but I've identified six possible suspects.
any of them white guys with crew cuts?
not that I'm aware of.
court to go
school's IN - Finch, what's the son's name again?
samuel Gates, junior.
Why?
I think we've been following the wrong Sam Gates.
Hey, Christina.
you're not going to believe what mark C. Said to Mrs. Kizer today.
I can't be there on time if I'm getting bad information.
the machine did not send us the wrong number.
if it says that judge Gates is in danger, then he is.
well, tell that to his son.
the kidnapping must connect.
it could be the first step in a larger plot that ends with the judge dead.
we can still put a stop to it, all of it.
but we need a plan.
I have a plan.
find Sam.
the man just lost his wife.
I won't let him wind up alone.
judge Gates.
dad? - Hey, Sam.
dad...
what's wrong? - He's fine, your honor... For now.
who are you?
where is my son?
no cops, no feds.
tell anyone and he's dead.
keep quiet and you'll hear from us tonight.
wait, look... We can handle this ourselves.
just tell me what you want.
this is Sam, leave a message.
Hi, uh, Christina, this is judge Gates.
please! Call me back.
Hi, uh, this is judge Gates. Is Sam there with Daniel?
no, is everything okay?
Oh, god.
let's figure out how we get your son back.
who are you?
I'm here to help you.
where is Sam?
where is my son?
you're with the kidnappers, aren't you? You're one of them.
no, I tried to stop them.
but the kidnappers made contact.
that's good.
that means they want to negotiate.
they won't hurt your son as long as he's worth something.
what do you mean, you tried to stop them?
you were there? - I was.
but not soon enough.
how did you know they were going to take him?
who the hell are you?
you have two questions right now:
who are you and where is my son?
which one do you want to focus on?
they were in my house.
how'd they get past the alarm?
I've tapped your phone and I'm setting up surveillance on your street.
it's our best shot at I. D.ing the kidnappers.
Where's Christina?
she was supposed to be here when he got home.
I didn't see her.
could she be in on it?
that's impossible.
she loved Sam.
judge...
have you received any kidnapping threats?
tried any cases involving kidnappers?
I have about $300, 000 in the bank.
if this is about money, I can pay.
whatever this is about, I'm going to find your son.
and I'm going to bring him home.
stay here and wait for the next call.
they said no cops, no fbi.
they didn't say anything about me.
okay, finch.
you should have audio on his landline and video of the street outside gates' house.
I want to save that boy as much as you do, but remember, Mr. Reese...
we don't need a judge asking questions about who we are and what we do.
I can't work a kidnapping from arm's length.
I'll worry about Gates once we get Sam back.
where are we on the kidnappers? Any luck tracing their call?
I'm afraid not.
it was voice-over I. P.anonymized through the internet.
what about the other phone?
the one the spotter threw in the trash?
it's a disposable, obviously.
not much on the sim card.
some disconnected numbers and a handful of texts, all equally cryptic.
so I'm trying to hack the cell company for more information.
but their firewall is impressive.
you can't get in?
you built a machine that spies on the entire country.
when you work for the government, access is not a problem.
things are different now.
I'll figure it out.
well, figure it out quick.
the kidnappers killed the nanny.
they must have gotten Gates' alarm code out of her.
911 emergency, hello?
Hey, you seen Carter? - No.
detective.
detective.
you came down from the 51st right, Fusco?
the Bronx finest.
what brought you here?
I wanted a change of scenery.
wanted?
or needed?
you got something you want to say?
I heard some rumors that got me concerned.
I just like to know what I'm dealing with.
Carla, I'm going to buy you a coffee.
since you've been so nice.
cream, no sugar.
Oh, he comes when he's called. - Good.
now if I could just train you to stop trying to kill me.
how long am I going to have to work down here?
commute's a bitch.
you should be grateful.
takes some guys years to make task force.
Plus, I let you live.
Carter, is she getting close?
all I know right now is you pissed off real police, my friend.
she's not going to stop till she got you.
is that it?
ballistics.
and find out if there's been any ransom kidnappings reported.
white guys with crew cuts.
one with long hair.
kidnapping's big news. I'd have heard something.
what about amber alerts?
child abduction? Is that what we're dealing with?
we?
since when are you on board?
it's still a missing kid.
Hey, whatever else I've done, I'm still a cop.
if you need some help, you let me know.
you understand?
I cracked the cell company's firewall.
the spotter's phone was purchased with cash and a phony name.
but our kidnappers have to sleep somewhere.
the location data puts this phone on the same block in brooklyn every night...
14th between Franklin and Wythe.
then I'll hit him where he lives.
I just found our guy.
is he talking?
not at the moment.
Turski, Leon Josef, with an "f." Hold on.
I know who has Sam, Finch.
SP--9.
it's a nasty street gang from Eastern Europe.
you dealt with them in your former employment?
they were trading with the Pashtun warlords.
guns for heroin.
but they also run kidnappings in Warsaw.
looks like they just opened up a new branch in New York.
come on, let's go for a ride.
that's all I need, detective.
thank you.
Carter, homicide, I got your message.
detective Olson.
I got your bolo.
white male, 6'2," graying temples, nice suit.
super said he saw him leaving at the time of the 911.
did you get audio on the call?
what audio? Nobody said boo.
M. E. Said she was dead two hours before.
so you think your guy killed her?
no, I think he called 911.
great, she's f. O.B. From Puerto Rico, no family, no boyfriend.
man, I thought you were going to gift wrap this for me.
what kind of work does she do?
Oh, she was a nanny on the west side.
we've got unis talking to her clients.
so if your guy wasn't the shooter, what was he doing here?
someone killed Christina?
Oh, god, I...
she wasn't here when Sam came home.
my son.
she wasn't here when he came home from school, so he called me.
I came home to be with him.
he's upstairs playing right now.
thanks for your time, judge.
Christina was, um...
she was, uh...
with us the night that Elizabeth died.
she was so good with Sam.
she was just a kid.
he's alive, okay?
as long as they need him, Sam's still alive.
you don't know that.
I need your help, judge.
have you ever heard of the Szajka Pruszkow, SP-9?
what are you?
an ex-cop?
FBI?
I have experience in situations like this.
that's all you need to know.
yeah?
well, maybe you're not enough.
maybe I should call those officers back and tell them the truth.
I know how to be invisible. The police and the fbi don't.
but I'm going after your son regardless.
now, have you ever heard of a gang called sp-9?
no.
who are they?
that's them now.
Hello?
you're alone? - yes.
I need proof that my son is alive. Put Sam on the phone.
dad?
Sam... Are you hurt?
dad, please, I want to go home!
relax, your honor.
your son is just fine. He's a good boy.
smart, like you.
how much?
I'll pay anything you want.
see?
smart.
but, fortunately for you, we don't want your money.
we want your help.
there's a case in your court right now, the people vs. Angela Markham.
the people... Are going to lose.
what?
throw the case, judge.
angela Markham walks.
or your son dies.
she mowed down some guy in a parking garage.
it's a simple hit and run.
well, now she's become the key to finding your son.
angela Markham is an account exec at a tech company near the trade center.
six weeks ago, she got drunk at an office retirement party, and hit a cpa on her way out.
charged with dwi and vehicular manslaughter.
it's just a random accident.
what does this woman have to do with the people who took my son?
I don't know.
but it's not just Sam's life they're playing with.
they're planning to kill you too.
how can you know that?
where are you getting your information?
let's just say I have a source and it's never wrong.
look, these people can't be reasoned with.
they can't be trusted.
if we're going to save your son, I need to find a way to hurt them.
the trial resumes in 30 minutes. What do I do?
just stall.
make it look like you're cooperating.
but buy me time.
well, this isn't a street gang.
this is a multinational corporation.
SP-9 is active in at least 18 countries in Europe, Asia...
after interpol took down the old Pruszkow Mafia, they got smarter.
started hiding their tattoos, studied military discipline, computers...
they have almost no digital footprint.
I have yet to find anything that could help us find Gates' son.
then focus on her.
somehow this girl and that gang connect.
my best guess, whoever she's sleeping with is high up in sp-9.
bet her boyfriend knows where they're keeping Sam.
and while I'm checking into the girl, what'll you be doing?
tracking down the rest of them.
the longest it's ever taken me to break someone is 16 hours.
you don't look like you're going to set a record.
want to talk?
you must like it in there.
caught a fresh one?
my guy in a suit led me to another case.
nanny from the Bronx murdered on her lunch break.
shooter dug the slugs out, huh?
just the one, and I'm not so sure that was the shooter.
it's my ex, I've got to take this.
you've got a real creepy sense of timing, man.
ballistics report, detective.
squat.
your slug's not in the system.
and I'm pretty sure that carter's working your crime scene.
Hey, does this dead nanny have anything to do with the missing kid?
I'll call when I need something else.
Hey, whoa, whoa, you need all the help you can get right now.
I mean, if I can i. d. The nanny killer, it might help you with the kid.
am I wrong?
I'll give you a way to contact me.
keep me posted and keep carter out of my way.
so what have we got?
primary's thinking romance-gone-bad, but those are always so messy.
this is too clean.
look at the circles on this entrance wound.
how many pissed-off boyfriends you know go out and buy a silencer?
romance, my ass.
your killer is a pro.
pull up a chair.
a SUCCESSFUL
all rise.
the honorable judge gates presiding.
be seated.
in the matter of the people vs. Angela Markham, court is now in session.
Hey, Leon.
how's the ride back there?
now...
you can have this juicy burger, or you can go for another spin.
all you have to do is help me find a scared little boy.
I don't know where he is, I swear to god.
who's Angela Markham and what does she have to do with sp -9?
never heard of her.
look, I don't know why they wanted that kid.
you don't know much, do you?
that's how they run it.
they work in small teams. Cells.
so who's in your cell? Full names.
we only use street names.
look, there's four guys, that's all I know.
now would you please let me out of here?
for no names and no info? - No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
okay, wait.
I know a place.
it's 3185 Lorimer.
it's where I go to get paid.
good.
how am I supposed to eat it?
you'll figure it out.
I observed a white suv driving erratically at high speed.
I stopped the vehicle for a possible dwi.
and what did you see when you approached the car?
blood.
on the front left fender.
objection, facts not in evidence.
sustained.
uh, how did the vehicle look?
there was front end damage.
a red fluid that appeared to be blood... - Objection, your honor.
sustained.
what happened then?
the defendant got out of the vehicle. She appeared to be intoxicated.
Objection!
sustained.
your honor... - Counselor...
I'm going to give you some time to better prepare your witness.
resume at 10: 00 a. m. Tomorrow.
judge Gates.
I'm disappointed, your honor.
how did you know I was here?
did she tell you?
who is Angela Markham to you anyway?
you don't want your son back, is that it?
let me talk to him.
not until you stop stalling.
look...
I have to do this right or the D. A. can appeal.
you want her free, I have to make sure she stays that way.
do it right. And do it fast.
and don't forget what you're playing for.
we're running out of time, Mr. Reese.
did you dig up anything on Angela?
going through her contacts and emails even as we speak.
any progress with the gang?
I got an address from Leon Turski. On my way now.
it's as good as done.
what, do you think I'm stupid?
it's not done until I'm free and clear.
this is bad for business.
my clients are asking questions.
that's not my problem.
you are the problem.
our whole operation is in jeopardy because you had too many shots.
unless you know someone who can do what I do, our deal stands.
once you get the charges dropped, I go back to work.
business as usual.
Where's the boy?
I don't know!
just found a way to make these guys hurt.
well, find it and find out who took it.
I am missing two men and $1/2 million.
someone is making a move against us.
I need to know who!
contact your teams!
change of plans.
I guess we know why they didn't ask for money.
I have six more just like it.
could be our bargaining chip to get Sam.
there may be lots more where these came from.
Angela's not sleeping with our kidnapper.
I think she's in business with him.
that tech company she works for, they make banking software.
the kind that can spot money laundering.
and I just found a room full of small bills.
in 2009, she oversaw the installation of a new anti -money laundering system at onestate bank.
if she still has access, she could turn that whole system off with the click of a mouse.
then sp -9 uses one of the biggest banks in the world to clean its dirty money.
they leave no digital footprint because this is how they pay for things.
cars, lawyers, safe houses.
if we can access those accounts, we'll have more than a bargaining chip.
we'll have a way to find Sam junior.
they know I'm stalling.
we're getting close.
just need to hold off a little longer.
you had your chance.
I'm not playing games with my son's life.
they'll kill you both as soon as they get what they want.
now, I can save your son.
you just have to trust me.
upon further review, I'm reversing my decision on admissibility.
your honor!
it doesn't pass the balancing test, counselor.
this video would unfairly bias the jury against miss markham.
then I move for a mistrial.
denied.
judge Gates... - Approach.
is there a problem, counselor?
respectfully, sir...
what the hell is going on?
one more word and you are in contempt.
I'll have you charged with misconduct if I have to.
trust me, Miss Ramirez.
you have no idea how far I'll go.
nothing further.
prosecution rests.
that's account data. It's confidential.
not anymore, we just got hacked.
what? How did they get past the firewall?
I'm working here.
what's your name? Who are you?
considering they called me when your system was compromised,
I'd say I'm the guy that just took your job.
a hospital would be nice about now.
Where's the boy?
I already told you, I don't know.
how about your boss's name? You know that yet?
I've got a family. You going to kill them too?
because he will.
you ever see two cats in a bag?
what?
you want out?
get your boss's name.
come here, I think I got something.
I did another canvass and I found a bodega near the nanny's house with eyes on the street, and it's on the nypd surveillance feed.
this is right around the time of the murder.
look at this.
white guy, long hair, pulling off gloves.
he could be our killer.
or just a guy with cold hands.
what makes you so sure Mr. Longhair is our man?
you get a description I don't know about?
I got a hunch.
I ran his plate to get a name, but I got a company instead.
Coldfield holdings. It's in Brooklyn.
worth a look.
Finch, got a name for you.
word is he's the boss.
well, if he is, he's careful about it. No accounts in his name.
the operation is massive.
every morning at 5: 00 a. m.angela shuts down onestate's software for three minutes.
millions of dollars flow in undetected.
SP-9's not just laundering their own money.
they have hundreds of clients.
all criminal themselves, I'm sure.
if Koska's using a shell corporation, it could take hours to find it.
try Coldfield.
definitely a large account.
looks like the money's being used to buy...
boats, planes, real estate...
most of it right here in New York.
that's them, get a list.
the place they're holding Sam will be on it.
I'm sending you an address.
a building less than ten blocks from Gates' house.
purchased just two days before angela went on trial.
if I can find Sam, the judge won't have to throw her case.
well, you better move fast.
I think Angela's jury just reached a verdict.
Finch, if you don't hear from me in four minutes, call 911.
send them here and tell them about Sam.
please rise.
has the jury reached a verdict?
we have, your honor.
what say you?
we find the defendant...
not guilty on all charges.
if you want your son back, come alone.
no cell, no gps, no weapons.
if I see anyone who's not you, your son dies.
so Angela Markham walks, and judge Gates is heading to a death sentence.
the machine sent us his number because they were planning to kill him all along.
him and his son.
scorched earth policy.
clean up and cover their tracks as soon as they get what they want.
we need to warn him.
I've tried. He won't listen.
but we have to do something.
we are.
Hello, Angela.
I want to see my son!
dad!
No!
I'll let you say good-bye.
look, you've got me.
I did what you asked.
everything you asked.
you can keep me, but please let my son go.
sorry.
your honor.
stop!
your name is Jarek Koska.
your bank account number is 1278340102.
last year you laundered at least $400 million to clients including ms-13, the sinaloa cartel, and the government of North Korea.
so you got some info from that alcoholic bitch.
I'm the last one you'll ever tell.
these aren't good odds for you.
I'm not alone.
every last dime has been transferred to an offshore account.
do exactly what I say and you might get it back.
but if they don't walk out of here alive, every client on your list will be notified that you've lost all their money.
then I won't have to kill you.
your clients will do that for me.
the operation's burned.
shoot them all.
dad!
judge, is he all right? - Yeah.
then take him home.
it's time we go for a little ride.
onestate bank 3185 Lorimer.
it's owned by Coldfield.
and there's Mr. Longhair's car.
NYPD, anybody home?
shoot, shoot!
goal!
that's us, 10, trees, 0.
you're so weird, dad.
do it again? - Let's go!
here we go!
I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again.
Yeah, I'm, uh, not great at keeping in touch with people.
I don't know how to thank you.
you don't need to say anything.
I'd prefer it actually.
look...
I don't know exactly what you do, or how you're doing it.
but I know that if people ever find out...
when they find out...
there won't be anything I can do to protect you.
go play with your son.
what did he say?
that we don't need to worry.
he might even help us someday.
I was listening to your conversation, Mr. Reese.
and I was reading between the lines.
I suppose only time will tell which one of us is right.
thank you.
I beg your pardon?
for giving me a job.
try the eggs benedict, Mr. Reese.
I've had them many times.
stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I know because... I built it.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror but it sees everything
violent crimes involving ordinary people. People like you.
crimes the government considered irrelevant.
they wouldn't act, so I decided I would.
but I needed a partner.
someone with the skills to intervene.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
the call came in. We have a location on the target.
get a team, and I'll meet you there. We can handle this.
no. I want to be there in person.
I want to kill him myself.
wait. Can you rewind that for me?
I thought I was all done mopping up bodega shootings when I joined the homicide task force.
this looks like a stickup job to you?
then maybe you need to go back to working a precinct.
there was no money taken.
double tap, close range-- this was an execution.
we got any I. D. on the vic?
not yet, but you haven't seen the best part.
rewind it again.
we got ourselves a witness.
any sign of him? - I put out a bolo.
had a team canvass a six-block radius.
guy vanished. I'd make myself scarce too.
this ain't no neighborhood you want to be called a snitch.
no, it's not. - Detective...
got a bunch of reporters out there begging me for scraps.
what do I tell them? Send them to the task force P. R. guy.
let him deal with them. - Yes, Ma'am.
detective Szymanski, organized crime, - This is detective Fusco. - Nice to meet you.
was this a mob hit?
the victim's a former "la cosa nostra" lieutenant
by the name of Benny Dagostino. He was out of the game for a couple of years, and then he popped up again on our radar about six months ago.
Brighton beach is Russian territory. So what's the l. C.N. doing here?
you kidding? There's a war going on.
half a dozen V. I.P. S. in the Russian mob were taken out last month.
word is Benny's boss ordered the hits.
this was retribution. - So who's his boss?
we don't know much...
other than a name-- Elias.
you heard of him? Oh, yeah. We go way back.
one of his guys took a shot at me last week.
this Elias is a clever bastard. Nobody even knows what he looks like.
what about the witness? Your boys have any luck finding him?
no, but have another look at the surveillance footage.
the victim said something to the witness.
if it's a dying declaration and he named the killers, it'd be admissible. Yeah, but we've got a problem.
the Russian owner of this fine establishment was on a conveniently timed smoke break when all this went down.
he's not giving us anything.
you think he told the shooters we found a witness?
if he did, the Russians will knock down every door in this neighborhood till they find him.
well, my guys are working the block.
something will pop. - It better.
we got to get to this witness before the Russians do.
I received his number late last night.
his name is Charlie Burton. The guy is worried about something.
I'm not seeing a threat yet. What's his story, Finch?
he's a high-school history teacher working in the Brighton Beach school district.
lives alone, never married-- not much to go on.
well, maybe a student's after him.
you know, teaching can be a dangerous profession.
Yes, I imagine espionage was a much safer choice,
Mr. Reese.
Hello, Lionel. I'm not sure how you usually do what you do,
but I'm looking for a guy, and I could use some help.
he's a witness, saw a Russian mob hit go down.
he's caucasian, 5'10," bald.
probably not the most popular guy in his class, If you know what I mean.
we need to find him. I think I already did.
why am I not surprised? Listen, whoever did this hit,
they're gonna come looking for him.
they've already found him.
Mr. Reese...
we might want to leave this one to the authorities.
no time. I'm heading in.
cover the exits.
the rest of you come with me.
get out of my apartment. Mr. Burton, you're in danger.
the men from the bodega are here.
now, how do you know about that? Did they send you?
sir, you have a Russian hit team closing in,
which leaves us with approximately five seconds before you need to make a decision.
how do I know you're not one of them? Because I'm standing in front of you
and you're still alive.
doesn't seem like I've got a choice.
where did this piece of garbage go? I'll double back.
Mr. Reese, can you get out?
do you need me to call in a distraction?
let me get back to you on that. Come on.
let's get moving...
now.
okay, the fastest way out of this neighborhood is through those buildings.
what, are you joking? Even the Russians don't go into the Double "B"s.
a Bulgarian drug dealer runs the place.
okay, Finch, I'm gonna need another route out of here.
we're on our own. I need your cell phone. I don't believe in them.
Mr. Reese, can you hear me?
Hey, this isn't mine!
not mine either. Get in.
may I at least have your name Before we commit grand theft auto together?
first, we need to get you to the police,
so you can tell them about what you saw at the bodega. The Russian mob is after me, friend.
they've got people on the inside. If I testify, I'm dead.
I know a detective we can trust.
but we need to get you across the river to Manhattan.
get down!
we need to keep moving.
that's going to be a problem. You say the Russians don't go in there?
well, that's where we're going.
see what I mean?
this is crazy.
I still don't even know who you are.
I help people. And you need help.
well...
bullet went straight through clean
no bone damage.
but we need to get you cleaned up before it gets infected. You see a pharmacy nearby?
the men you saw last night at the bodega...
what can you tell me about them?
what difference does it make?
I guess I like to know a little bit about the guys who are shooting at me.
I worked through dinner, and I was grading papers.
and I stopped at the store on my way home.
I couldn't decide between minestrone and split pea.
and then I saw the guys with guns, and I hid.
did you see their faces?
they had masks.
but one of them lifted his, like he wanted that guy to see his face.
but that guy they killed...
he said he had a message for someone named Elias.
and he wanted me to give it to him, but I don't know an Elias.
I tried to tell him that.
Mr. Burton, what was the message?
I didn't understand it-- something about Vinnie.
Vinnie was gonna finish the job for him.
why didn't you call the police?
you don't understand this neighborhood, do you?
going to the cops here is like playing Russian roulette.
you don't know which side they're on.
one of my students' parents filed a police report last year.
then he got into an accident.
he's still eating through a straw.
I'll get you to a police officer you can trust.
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut and hope it all blows over.
I don't know. These guys look pretty upset.
if I testify...
I never get to come back here.
and I've worked too hard.
this is my home.
my students, for starters-- I-I can't leave them. They need me.
well, you won't do those kids any good if you're dead, Mr. Burton.
Charlie, please-- "Mr. Burton" Is for my students.
do you want to die, Charlie?
because this isn't a history lesson.
those bullets are real.
my name is John.
thank you for saving my ass, John.
thanks for coming down, Patti.
we're all very sorry for your loss.
you're not sorry. You hated my husband.
no, I only hated what he did for a living.
ma'am...
do you know why Benny was in Brighton Beach last night?
was he--I don't know-- conducting business?
Mrs. D'agostino...
I know that anger you're feeling right now
what it's like to lose someone you love.
help us find the men who did this to your husband.
it doesn't matter if you find them.
Elias will.
and he'll kill each and every single one of those Russian bastards.
Elias started a war that can't be won.
now, a lot of innocent people are gonna die if this continues.
do you want that? - If that's what it takes.
where is he, Patti?
where is Elias?
I never met him.
and his crew... they don't socialize.
that's why you'll never find him.
I'm a little confused.
why does Elias want Brighton Beach so bad?
you're not seeing it.
Brighton Beach is just the beginning.
Elias has bigger plans.
he'll reunite the five families and take out the Russian trash.
and then when he's finished, you people will be answering to him.
five or six heavily armed men were chasing a guy matching the description of our witness.
his name's Charlie Burton, by the way.
found out he had groceries delivered twice a month from the bodega,
and he wasn't dodging bullets by himself.
who was he with? - Some tall guy in a suit
definitely not with the Russians.
shot one of them in the knee before they got away.
what? You know him?
it's just someone I've been tracking for a while.
best I've got, he's former military-- a pain in the ass.
either one of them get hit? There seems to be an awful lot of shots fired.
looks like they got off okay.
I got a Russian thug in the hospital who isn't talking, But we got an ATM camera across the street.
that might help shed some light on things.
it'll take two weeks and a warrant to get the footage.
thankfully, a bystander got some footage of her own.
meet Peter Yogorov.
as in Ivan Yogorov, the Russian boss? Peter's his son.
yo, officer. - Yeah.
call over to the 8th.
tell them to pull any file we have pertaining to Ivan Yogorov.
Ivan Yogorov-- got it.
where are you, Mr. Reese?
who are these guys?
and what's this cop doing with them?
N. Y.P. D.
detective Fusco. - Hello, Detective.
I need to talk to you about our mutual friend.
who's this? And who the hell is our mutual friend?
I seem to recall you were going to take him to oyster bay once upon a time.
so you're his guy? --No, Detective. I think that's your role.
I've lost contact with him.
do you have any idea where he and the witness are now? --Yeah, somewhere in Brighton Beach.
the Russians opened fire on them in broad daylight.
those two are going nowhere fast with this type of heat on them.
unfortunately, the Russian mafia May not be our only problem.
I need you to run a license plate for me.
Yeah, sure, pal. I'll help you out...
if you can tell me what the hell it is I'm doing.
it relates to your case. That's all you need to know.
if I hear anything about our friend, How do I get in touch with you?
you don't. I'll find you, detective.
I'm telling you, I winged the guy. Let's get in there and finish him off.
Laszlo, wait up. We need to call papa, regroup.
you want to wait around out here? Fine. I'm going in.
you want to go at it with a bunch of Bulgarian tweakers?
we made a deal
they stay out of our territory. We stay out of theirs.
cover every exit.
no way those two get out without going past us first.
I need you to stay awake, Charlie.
I don't want you to go into shock.
so how did you wind up doing whatever it is you do, John?
it's... Complicated.
what about you?
did you always want to be a teacher?
no, it was sort of a career shift.
I came to like the kids a lot.
a lot of their parents are affiliated with the Russian mob,
so I try to give them other options.
they're lucky to have you.
only the ones that I get out of the life and into college.
what about the kids who don't make it?
probably the ones shooting at us.
don't go anywhere.
what? Wait. Where--where are you going?
to find us a pharmacy.
you should be careful About your cholesterol intake, detective.
what, are we dating?
do you have the information I asked you for?
you're the boss, huh? The voice on the other end of the phone?
the plate's registered to a shell corp in midtown. It's a dead end.
Hey, let me ask you something.
who are you trying to track down, "Mr. Friend of a friend"?
maybe. You mentioned in your report
that the victim spoke to Mr. Burton before he expired.
whoa. What do you mean? You read my report?
how did you read my report? - doesn't matter, Mr. Fusco.
what matters is that whatever message Benny was passing along,
it means a great deal to Elias.
so you're telling me the Russians want
the poor bastard dead because he witnessed them taking out Benny.
and Elias wants him dead Because he thinks he has sensitive information.
not his lucky day, is it? - indeed.
that car-- I need you to report it stolen,
then email the report number to that address.
Hey, you heard from our mutual friend?
what, are you worried about him, detective?
let's go with curious. No.
no word from him.
I made almost twice what I did yesterday. You still ain't made more than me.
Hello, fellas. Can I borrow some of your drugs?
Oh, no. Easy, fella. I'm not looking for a fight.
looks like you found one anyway.
don't do it. I'm telling you, now.
thank you.
if Ivan's sons are involved in this,
could be the man himself was at the bodega
avenge his brother's death in person.
Elias' crew took him out last week,
along with a half a dozen other russian hitters.
I thought the Russians were untouchable in brighton beach.
they were. No one knows where elias gets his information.
he's always one step ahead of all of them...and us.
what I still don't get is why Elias
is trying to make a move for Brighton beach.
a woman named Marlene Elias was murdered in 1973.
she had an illegitimate son with Don Moretti.
I think Elias is the Don's kid.
last place Moretti ran Before he got locked up was Brighton Beach.
so the Don's bastard son came back to clean up?
claim his birthright?
what is that?
cocaine.
I guess there's a first time for everything.
is that glue? Yeah.
nothing like over-the-counter polymer To close a wound in a pinch.
you learn all this in hero training?
something like that.
thank you.
sure.
no, really...
thank you.
if it wasn't for you, I'd be dead right now.
you ever use one of these? Don't you think it would be better if you kept it?
well, just in case.
no, last time I touched a gun, I shot cans with one of my foster dads...
accidentally killed a bird-- Not my favorite childhood memory.
simple. Look...
safety's there. Just load the magazine like this.
rack it. Simple.
do you really think we'll get out of here?
we have a hell of a lot better chance than we did 20 minutes ago.
here they come.
you after those boys running around our building? That's right.
he took something from my people.
we don't give you any problems, you take 'em out?
I can make that deal.
give one to the other guy. We'll help you out a whole lot quicker.
someone told me they're hiding out on the fourth floor.
and one of them's already bleeding.
put this on.
if I can find a line that's still operating,
we can make a call.
wow, I thought I was the only one who still had a hard line.
I was hoping there was someone in this building
as old-fashioned as you, Charlie.
I'm sorry I got you into this mess.
it's okay. It's my job.
it's a dangerous career choice.
that's the second time today I've heard that.
it's funny. You remind me of him.
Finch... I was just talking about you.
where are you, Mr. Reese?
the double "B" Housing projects
fourth floor, north tower.
find me a way out of here, Finch-- One that no one else will use.
city planning office should have old blueprints.
how is Mr. Burton faring?
he's wounded but stubborn.
he'll pull through.
the Russians aren't the only ones after him.
I think Elias is looking for him too.
two service entrances
the one closest to you is in the northeast corridor.
can you make it there? - We've got no choice.
tell Fusco to meet us at pier 11 at 7: 00 A. M.
we'll be on the East River Ferry.
be careful, Mr. Reese.
come on.
service stairs should be around the next corridor.
keep your eyes open. They could be anywhere.
Hey, I think they went this way.
what now? - Wait here.
who's there?
Mr. Burton? - Will?
what are you doing?
Hey, Will.
came in looking for a shortcut, and we just, uh...
this is my friend, by the way.
we just got lost. Check the south side.
come on. My dad's not home.
you can hide in here.
vehicle Recovery Services.
Yeah, this is Detective Fusco, shield number 7645.
I'm trying to turn on the locator in a stolen vehicle.
uh, report number is...
thank you, Detective. How can I help you?
Yeah, could you turn on the car's G. P.S. Locator
and the microphone?
of course. Bear with me, please.
I thought you and your dad moved out of here.
not yet. He said we will as soon as he gets a job.
Yeah, times are tough right now. I'm sure he'll get one soon.
just don't move out of my school district, okay?
you did your homework? - Yep. All of it.
what did you think? - Edmond's cool
a survivor, you know? Even though he got his revenge,
some bad stuff still stuck with him. Yeah, you're a smart kid, Will.
you just need to show up to class more.
I'm trying. That's all any of us can do, right?
zombies? They're taking over the universe.
Yeah, can't have that.
who are you?
you're that cop.
word is the Russians are inside the double "B"s.
we better get to them first.
is that you, Elias?
open up, or we're coming in.
what do you want? Hey, little man. You all alone in there?
what's it look like?
why don't you let me in, so I can make sure?
my papa taught me better
than to let strangers inside our place, Especially punks.
is that right? - That's right.
he also said that vory are supposed to show respect To one another.
your papa's a smart man.
you be good, kid.
Thanks, Will. It's all good, Mr. Burton.
you're the best teacher I've got.
can you make it to the service stairs?
I'll try, but the painkiller sort of wore off.
why don't you just use the old entrance? They closed it down a few years ago.
the stairs got all rotted. - Where is it?
it's--it's down the hall.
it's back the way that you came.
Thanks.
come on.
I owe you one. I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Burton.
Yeah. Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.
you... did you guys get that hallway?
let's go.
open up, or we're coming in.
Hello?
anyone home?
can't hide forever.
wherever you are, we're gonna find you. And then we're gonna end you.
come on. Let's keep moving.
looks like you got left behind.
how can I help The New York City Police Department tonight?
your son Peter's wanted for questioning In the murder of Benny D'agostino.
know where we might find him?
who is this Benny? - Come on, Ivan.
we heard Benny was the trigger man In your brother's murder.
and we know the Bodega run was payback.
you seem to know a lot For someone who is here to ask me questions.
Mr. Yogorov, we don't want any more bloodshed.
my Peter was here working all day long.
he's at the storage getting more wine
for an event tonight.
with all due respect, Sir,
you may not be the best person to give your son an alibi.
if you are here to accuse my Peter of something,
I suggest you come back with a warrant...
if you can get one.
there are no winners in this war, Ivan-- Only dead soldiers.
are you ready to lose your sons too?
if I knew to what you were referring,
I'd say that this so-called war
was started by this coward Elias, not me.
he's the one who comes to my neighborhood...
stealing from me, killing my people...
not the other way around.
now, if you excuse me, I have an event to host.
please.
mind if I borrow this for a moment? Screw you.
it's a bad move to insult your hostage taker, Laszlo.
keep your mouth shut, or I'll shut it permanently.
let's go.
Finch, it's me.
get word to Carter that her bodega shooters are inside the Double"B"s.
of course.
and I'll make sure detective Fusco meets you and the witness at the ferry.
you first.
where are we going now? - Across the river.
come on, Laszlo, let's move.
just got a text. He's heading to Pier 11.
let's get over there to intercept him, now.
nice collar, detective. - You too, Carter.
you find out who called it in? - I have an idea.
Yeah. Fusco.
and I was just starting to believe That we could trust you, detective. I'm disappointed.
what are you talking about?
Elias' men are on their way To meet our friends at the ferry.
how the hell'd they find out? - I was going to ask you.
you're blaming me for this? - Then who told them?
listen, there's no way I would've
detective, are you there?
when we get you across the river, I'm going to hand you off to my detective.
now, you can trust him.
Charlie, I need you to testify.
one thing I know for sure
after everything we went through last night,
I don't want to see these cretins running around my town Ever again.
Thanks.
ready to talk? You ready to let me go?
Peter, we got you on camera.
we've got witnesses that say
you and your brother were shooting up the streets In Brighton beach.
no idea what you're talking about.
it's a beautiful morning.
I have to thank you, John.
to tell you the truth, I didn't think I'd see another one.
Elias killed your uncle.
you, your father, and your brother Went to the bodega for revenge.
you didn't know what Elias looked like,
so his lieutenant Benny D'agostino Was the next best thing.
and now you're trying to rub out the witness
the guy who saw your father's face.
we heard from a source That Elias was supposed to be at the bodega - That night. - He was meeting Benny.
Yeah. But when we showed up...
Benny was all we saw.
found out what really went down after the owner called us.
he said there was another guy.
Hey, what are you-- Corrupt P. D.
gun for hire? What kind of guy takes money
to protect a scumbag like your boss here?
you think he's going to testify... After everything he's done?
he's tearing this town apart.
what are you talking about?
you don't know who he is, do you...
what he's capable of?
you don't really get it, do you?
you honestly think we'd go to all this trouble
for a witness?
you're in the middle of a situation
that you don't even understand.
don't make me shoot you, John.
drop your weapon and kick it to me, please.
I thought you didn't like guns.
you know, sometimes you have to do things you don't like.
like teaching history to the children of your enemies?
three years, I watched them
cleaning up after the children of those pigs.
it's a good amount of time to learn
what makes your enemies tick, what makes them weak.
you know all the secrets you and your family tried to hide,
Laszlo, I learned all about from your own flesh and blood?
your children hate you almost as much as I do.
tie yourself to the railing, John,
nice and tight. I know how capable you are Of getting out of difficult situations. On your knees, please.
you were meeting Benny at the bodega that day,
weren't you?
the shooters were looking for you.
Yeah, the benefits of no one knowing who you are Or what you look like.
that's gone now, I suppose. It's time to evolve.
I'm ready for the next step.
go ahead. I'd rather die than see you running my city.
you know what Benny said before he died?
he said, "Veni, vidi, vici"-- I came, I saw, I won.
he said your almighty Bratva was already crumbling.
he said we'd already won.
this is for Benny.
Elias, if you kill him...
I'm not going to kill him. - I'm just going to send a message.
you tell your papa, Laszlo, if he gets out of town tonight,
I'll let him live. Brighton beach belongs to me now.
I thought about killing you, John.
but I realize that that would seem ungrateful.
besides, how do you take the life of someone so talented?
I could really use a guy like you in my organization.
I wish you luck, John.
if you stay out of my way, I'll stay out of yours.
what if I don't?
then we'll meet again under less pleasant circumstances.
you believe me now?
I'm sorry, detective.
nice to see you, Lionel. Your suspect is tied to the railing.
tell him "You're welcome.
couldn't have known about Charlie.
the machine found a man who was targeted for death.
we just didn't know that he was also a killer.
it's my fault he's out there, Finch. It's not yours alone.
we just saved a man whose only goal in life is revenge.
he spent years studying his enemies through their own children.
John, we have limited information.
we knew when we began this that we might make mistakes.
but we have to go now. We have more people to help-- more numbers.
and how many of those numbers will come up because we saved one man's life?
boss...
it's done.
no, it's just beginning.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I know, because I built it.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you, crimes the government considered irrelevant.
they wouldn't act, so I decided I would.
but I needed a partner - Someone with the skills to intervene.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
he's all yours.
I already told the other americans... I deliver fruits and vegetables.
you deliver explosives for al-qaeda.
your cell is responsible for a suicide bomb that killed three U.S.soldiers in fallujah.
you should tell me the location of the remainder of those explosives.
talk to me, or else you're gonna have to talk to my boss.
and believe me when I tell you, you don't want to talk to my boss.
all right.
Hello, Yusuf.
getting too close - Enough already. She goes... today.
but it's got to be clean.
you can't keep coming in here like this. - I gotta go.
detective Carter? It's Mrs. Kovach here to bail out her husband.
again? - Figured maybe you could talk to her.
Thanks.
I work homicide, Mrs. Kovach, okay?
I'm the one who has to investigate it when your husband finally beats you to death.
look, every time you tell us it was an accident, you're strengthening the story he's gonna use to get out of it
that you were clumsy, accident-prone.
do you hear me?
the stairs. I fell down the stairs.
if he puts his hands on you again, call me.
sorry. I have to go.
I don't know why you bother, Carter. You can't save them all.
that's a homicide waiting to happen.
figured I'd try to stop one for a change.
DNA came back on the shooter you winged a couple weeks ago.
the guy who took a shot at you.
half the dna matched Marlene Elias...
the other half... Don Moretti.
Carl Elias-the bastard son you left to rot in the system after you murdered his mother almost 40 years ago.
your mistress. - I told you before, sweetheart.
I ain't the father of nobody by that name.
DNA says otherwise, Don. You're a perfect match.
and guess what. Your son's all grown up now.
just a few of his recent victims.
retired detective Bernie Sullivan, your old capo Vincent Deluca.
what is this? What do I care? I'm gonna die an old man in here.
maybe sooner than you think.
you killed his mother, and you left him to the wolves.
what do you think he's gonna do to you?
I wouldn't expect any father's day cards.
if you help me, I can offer you protective custody.
who do you think you're talking to?
you don't get it. Elias can get to you anywhere.
he can find someone you know, turn them on you.
and you know what? It's not a question of if, but when.
telling me this guy already took out a cop, took a shot at you 'cause you got too close, and you came here to warn me, huh?
consider it a courtesy call.
there a task force going after this Elias, or is it just you, detective?
what is that supposed to mean?
way it looks from my side of the fence, you're all alone.
sounds to me like maybe he's coming after you.
all units respond - Shooting at 168th and audubon.
I came as soon as I heard the description.
Yeah, got a young african-american male gunned down on his way home.
I got 9-millimeter casings all over the curb.
looks like it was a drive-by.
any witnesses see the car?
in this neighborhood? You're kidding, right?
Ronnie Middleton. - You knew this kid?
he witnessed a shooting six months ago up in the bronx.
I. d.'d the shooter-neighborhood thug Hector Alvarez.
this kid was a snitch? - Yeah. He got cold feet though.
recanted his testimony. D. a. Dropped the case.
looks like Hector found him.
he won't get away with it again.
was ronnie carrying?
Yeah, just a, uh, cell phone, and that soda bottle.
mariquitas cola?
Mexican soda.
they don't sell that everywhere.
I think I know a place that does.
and I know somebody saw something.
Yeah, getting them to talk is another matter.
I'm sure you'll charm something out of them, Fusco.
you know, Carter, we've been working together for a while now.
my friends call me "Lionel."
you got a first name?
sure, detective.
my name's detective Fusco with the N.Y.P.D.
if anyone has seen or heard anything pertaining to what hpened here tonight, you can call me at
I already have your card, Lionel.
what the hell are you doing here? - Just checking in.
what happened here?
lead poisoning. It's going around the neighborhood.
N.Y.P.D. mister...?
Castillo. I'm-i'm closed for the night.
you see what happened out here tonight, Mr. Castillo?
I was busy in the back. I- I-I didn't hear anything till the police showed up.
see, I find that hard to believe, Mr. Castillo.
after that young man bought this mariquitas soda from your store...
he walked out and got shot like a dog in the street.
he bought the soda. He left the store.
I heard the shots, but-but I didn't see anything.
okay, so you heard shots.
you didn't look out, see a car take off?
please...
not here. - I understand.
why don't you come down to the precinct tomorrow, give a statement?
just what you saw.
okay, I'll come down tomorrow.
Mr. Reese? Where have you been?
we've got another number.
if you're gonna tell me ronnie middleton, you're a little late, finch. Kid's already gone.
what? Where are you?
at the scene of a homicide, wondering how the machine can see one and miss another.
I'm sorry, Mr. Reese. The machine detects acts of premeditation.
and I'm afraid we've got a big problem with the one it's seeing right now.
whose number came up?
mutual friend of ours...
detective Carter.
want to tell me where you were last night?
I was about to ask you the same thing.
working a new case.
there you go. - Thank you.
and I don't have the curfew.
you weren't home when I called, and you didn't answer your cell, Taylor.
I was only a half an hour late.
Yeah. You're staying with grandma till I'm off this case.
Hey, Taylor.
so I saw you got that, uh, homecoming dance coming up friday. You gonna go?
Yeah, it must be tough being a freshman.
all the girls going out with the older guys.
I already asked somebody. - Really?
Yeah. - Well, I want to meet her.
I'm gonna be late for school.
I'm taking you. I have time.
stay. I thought I charged this thing.
after you. - Thank you.
raised you well.
did you know she had a son?
didn't know you cared.
no dad in the picture for some time.
you been looking into the detective, Mr. Reese?
it pays to know the person coming after you, Finch.
okay, they're leaving now.
you'd better hurry up.
almost got it. - Forget it. Get out of there now.
do we have picture?
and a gps tracker. Nice work, Harold.
we need eyes and ears on her 24-7, even inside the precinct.
Finch, Carter's going right into Hector's shop.
primary suspect in the Ronnie Middleton shooting.
how's the car business, Hector?
you say that like you really care, detective.
care about where you were last night.
go ahead, spin that yarn, dazzle me.
sorry. I'm a domesticated man.
I was back with my old lady, watching some show. Ask her.
of course. Always with the loyal alibi.
you know, Monica, he's handsome, but you can do better.
you got some huevos coming down here all alone, lady.
so that wasn't your muscle car took a detour into Washington heights last night?
Nah, I hear it's dangerous down there.
I know y'all heard what happened to Ronnie Middleton.
I heard he ate a bullet that didn't agree with him.
nice shop, nice tools.
doing well for yourself, Hector.
you make all this money fixing up old cars?
I got a record. I got to work for myself.
this is a nice ride. You mind if I check it out?
sure as hell do.
you're gonna need a warrant for that.
you messed up, taking that kid out, Hector.
it's a shame what happened to that kid...
even if he was a punk-ass snitch.
you won't get away with it again.
I will find a way to bring you down.
good luck with that warrant, detective.
didn't know you collected dolls, Finch.
as you know, I collect rare books, Mr. Reese.
180-gram vinyl and a xerox alto when I can find one.
this doll is for detective Fusco.
Fusco's into dolls?
he is now, if we want to keep eyes on detective Carter.
I'll make sure it lands on his desk.
I've been looking into our new number.
Carter, detective first grade, homicide task force.
single mom, teenage son, served as an army interrogator.
passed the bar in '04, gave it up to go back on the force.
it's impressive, Mr. Reese.
impressive lady. Honest to a fault.
which means she made a lot of enemies, both in the criminal world and in her own department.
I've narrowed the list of possible suspects to a little over 300 or so.
day in the life of a homicide detective.
any more immediate threats?
Hector Alvarez... Indicted for homicide on a case she worked six months ago...
till the charges were dropped.
edward Kovach - Repeat felon, spouse abuser, whose wife she's taken a keen interest in protecting. And then there's Elias
ruthless killer, organized crime boss, who's already taken a shot at her.
well, she's a walking target. Gonna have to keep her in sight at all times.
you have to be careful. Get too close, you risk getting caught.
that's a chance I got to take.
what am I supposed to do, let her catch a bullet?
what will you do if she catches you?
well, I'm sure you'll figure something out, Harold.
what the hell?
detective Fusco.
happy birthday, Lionel.
Thanks, but no thanks.
it's not my birthday. I don't know what the hell you're trying to tell me here.
just put it on your desk and face it towards Carter.
Why?
cause there's a camera inside, and we need to know everyone she's talking to.
you know something I don't?
she in trouble? - Well, you tell me.
ask around with some of your corrupt pals inside the force.
Hey, what's going on? What do you need?
I need to find out who might want to take Carter out.
whoa, wait a minute. I can't be involved in something like that.
no, Lionel, just turn the camera towards her desk.
nice doll.
Yeah, my, uh - My son gave it to me.
how'd it go with the old don at the big house?
tried to reach out, see what he knew about his biological son.
Elias, huh? Old man just shut me down.
seems to think every cop is dirty.
Yeah. Maybe back in his day.
that bodega owner Castillo come in yet?
not that I know of.
gonna have to pay him another visit.
you coming?
Nah, you know what? Why don't you, uh, go ahead?
I - I got a thing. I'll catch up with you later, okay?
okay.
come here. - Yo, I ain't done nothing.
hands where I can see 'em. - Get off.
got any needles? Anything that's gonna stick me?
this is violation of my civil liberties.
Finch, I don't like the looks of this.
bitch, you better get your hands off me.
shut up and get your head down.
yo, thanks for making it look good, detective.
I think I tweaked my wrist, man.
that was a little too theatrical, bottlecap.
hey- - Wait a minute, Reese.
I think she knows him.
it's all for show. Must be one of her c. i.s.
that's 'cause after I last got popped, I used my time to rehabilitate myself.
you got clean?
come on now, B.C. - I'm serious. These pipes are junk-free.
but I can always use some scratch, you know what I'm saying?
I need to know what you've heard about the new guy Elias.
Yeah, I've been hearing that name up and coming a lot.
I never seen him, but I-I hear he's a man not to be trifled with.
you, um, know anything about that shooting last night over on 168th and audubon?
drive-by, right?
I know the block, just not the players.
you ever hear the name Hector alvarez come up or see him cruise the block in his g. t.o?
I didn't see the car or hear nobody talk about Hector, but I can ask around.
good looking out, B.C.
if you get anything back on, um, Hector or Elias, there's more where that came from.
Hey, captain.
welcome back, detective.
didn't think you'd grace us with your presence again once you spent time with the perfumed folk downtown.
how'd a half-wit like you pull that off?
I guess the half-wit's still got some juice, huh, captain?
they got me working with detective Carter, and...
I'm starting to hear some things.
yeah? Like what?
maybe she's not so well-liked by, uh, a certain element.
listen, Lionel... Things are going back to the way they used to be.
used to be? - Thing about organized crime?
it was organized. Things worked.
trains ran on time.
this new guy... He knows the rules.
new guy - You mean Elias.
runs a tight ship... Low profile.
not like these cutthroat russian idiots.
he knows who to grease... All the way up to city hall.
look, the economy's in the toilet.
detective Carter doesn't understand the rules.
she's bad for business.
What'd she do?
sniffing around... Trying to build a case.
she's gunning for Elias. She's got to go.
it's a tricky business, getting rid of a cop.
went through the proper back channels... Up the chain of command.
permission granted.
it's just got to look... Clean.
clean? You mean like in the line of duty?
I'm starting to feel caught in the middle here, captain.
I'd keep my distance, if I were you.
you didn't come down to the precinct like you told me you would, Mr. Castillo.
I got no help today. I'm a very busy man.
did you see this car before or after the shooting?
you didn't tell me that the guy that they killed was a witness to another shooting.
he decided not to testify. Didn't save him.
if you think that's gonna convince me to, it's not helping.
the point is... If Hector Alvarez thinks you saw him shoot someone, he's gonna come after you too.
please. Look, I have a family.
exactly.
if you help me, I can protect you and your family.
if you don't... He could still come after you.
what's the word, Lionel?
I did some checking around.
Carter's name came up and not in a good way.
Elias wants her gone... Today.
killing a cop brings a lot of heat.
Yeah, which is why they're gonna make it look clean.
he could set up a patsy or pay someone off on a case she's working.
all I know is, every door that Carter walks through could have a bullet behind it.
did you see this guy in your store last night?
please. That's all I need.
I saw him earlier.
he's been in my store before, to buy condoms, beer.
what does it mater? I'm not gonna give you a statement anyways.
can you please leave my store?
okay. Okay. Thank you.
Oh, sorry, detective.
I didn't realize that was you from behind.
lot of fine girls out today.
keep it moving, lover boy.
you got to be careful on this block.
I heard some kid got popped last night.
you got any kids, detective?
stay off this block.
I see this car roll by one more time, i'm gonna impound it.
I'll be seeing you around, Mr. Castillo.
get out of here. - Let's go.
Elias wants Carter gone.
possible he'll use someone with motive... The suspect in one of her cases.
Carter's at a bar.
I thought she was on duty.
with this many people after her, I'd be inclined to pick up the tab.
tell me, Eddie...
what kind of degenerate es that to his wife?
Carter's paying kovach a visit.
why is a homicide detective intervening in a domestic case?
maybe she's like us. Trying to prevent something bad from happening.
what happens between a man and his woman behind closed doors is none of your damn business.
can't stop you from boozing your life away.
but you go home and put your hands on your wife again, i'm coming after you.
you come after me, and I will exercise my second amendment rights.
and I promise you, I got a pretty big gun.
man as angry and bitter as you are...
I got to admit, Finch, I sure like her style.
I think we got a new front-runner.
all were killed from a suicide vest you helped transport.
they had families... People that loved them.
I'm sorry for the soldiers, but I deliver vegetables.
I know you're working with al-qaeda, Yusuf...
cause I have photos here of you loading vests into your truck.
now, you want to tell me all these photos of you are fake?
show me where the other suicide vests are hidden, Yusuf.
point to the location.
do you know what they will do if they find out that I helped you?
they will kill my wife.
they will kill my son.
I would rather you just kill me now.
Carter, is that the d. o.a.'s phone - Ronnie middleton?
his mother hasn't even come to the morgue.
this kid was all alone.
he deserved better.
so far, I've got nothing on Hector.
analyst from the real-time crime center sent over footage from some of the cameras around bodega la nueva.
some? There's more cameras than this?
Yeah. Mayor wants one on every corner.
wow, no wonder I feel like I'm always being watched.
I figured Hector's g. t.o. had to pass through this intersection, but nothing, nada.
maybe he didn't drive. Maybe he walked.
Castillo said he came into his market a couple times to purchase some booze and trojans.
so? - His girlfriend lives in the bronx too.
why would he have to go 25 blocks downtown for condoms?
cause Don juan got a little chicky on the side.
Hector was on foot.
maybe he walked from her apartment to the market.
and that's where Hector bumped into Ronnie.
if we can find this chica, we might have ourselves a new witness.
I'm gonna make some phone calls.
look, I got to go. You can thank me later, all right?
hello. What, do you miss me already?
you're a hard man to miss, Lionel.
I'd say this Carter situation's got you worried.
what are you gonna do, follow her around from now on?
I'm not. You are.
I've got some business to take care of.
don't let her get in any trouble.
Carter's gunning for you.
hell, she's probably gonna catch you.
why you spending so much time trying to protect her?
she's a good cop... Good person.
hell, you should try it sometime, Lionel.
Yeah, thanks, look, I'm just saying, if she wasn't around, it would probably solve a lot of your problems, now, wouldn't it?
if anything happens to her, Lionel, i'm coming for you next.
what the
knock, knock.
what do we have here?
Hector's a busy man - Fixing cars and running guns.
who are you, man?
tell Hector I'm the guy that just put him out of business.
if I see him again, I'll close down more than the shop.
if you help us, I can protect you and your family.
I promise.
this is just a negotiation for you.
you don't care about me or my family.
your son - He's named after you.
he's turning 8 in 14 days, right?
favorite sport? Soccer.
but it's too dangerous to play in the field by you.
your only brother, naji, was killed nine months ago by an i. e.d.
you visit his grave every day.
so, you see... You are not just a negotiation...
not to me.
do you have children? - A son. Taylor.
would you trust his life to a complete stranger?
I'd do whatever was in my power to protect him.
you lost your brother, Yusuf.
I lost someone very close to me too.
it changed everything.
you and me... We're not that different.
no. We want the same thing.
for our children to walk down the street and not be afraid.
show me where those explosives are.
the location is not on the map.
then you'll take us to them.
for our children.
Hey, B.C. You got anything on Hector's new woman?
relax. Fusco's all right.
easy there, hubcap. I don't bite.
all right, let's make this quick.
I seen Hector's g. t.o. Outside the lookie-loo.
turns out he's bumping one of the dancers-mel li.
if you ask ask me, Hector got a little tired of his chica and wanted some strange.
you done good.
I thought you said... You know, real money... Reward money.
okay. Well, if this pans out, I will get you that reward money.
I'll meet you later, even take you to dinner at your favorite spot.
all right. Yeah, but only 'cause it's you.
you always been good to me, Carter.
okay. Take care.
Yes, me and Hector was together all night.
we watched tv, and then we went to bed.
What'd you watch?
I don't know. Hector's always changing the channels.
I heard that about that guy.
he gets bored, he likes to switch it up, huh?
is that why he has that other girl on the side?
no, no, no. You see, my man don't step out on me.
I'll cut it off.
Ooh, okay. Come here. I want you to see something.
that's Hector's cell phone bill.
you know whose number that is? 'cause he dialed it 33 times.
I don't know, it's probably one of his homies.
that man gossips like a little schoolgirl.
well, it's easy enough to find out.
go ahead. Dial it.
so you were with Hector all night.
last night, this morning.
Hector's a morning person. He likes to spoon.
Hello?
Hello? - Who is this?
wait. Who the hell are you?
okay, all right. Looks like you two got a lot to sort out.
make sure they don't kill each other.
Oh, no! - Oh, no! You got to be kidding me!
Carter, looks like you're not the only one who's got a beef with Hector Alvarez.
some guy came into his body shop and shot up the place.
bangers inside got a taste of their own medicines.
said the guy had a submachine gun and a grenade launcher.
you believe that?
this guy wearing a suit?
no, motorcycle jacket. why?
maybe it's in the cleaners.
Hector's wanted for questioning. Suffice it to say, he's, uh, disappeared.
somebody knows where he is.
if I find Hector, I'll give him your best.
Hector's on the run.
he's not gonna be a problem for Carter anymore.
I'm not so sure about that.
Carter is now determined to get justice for ronnie.
one way or another, she will find where Hector's hiding.
the guy's running guns.
wherever he is, he's heavily armed.
and when she goes to arrest him- - I'll just have to get there first.
is everything okay, Mr. Reese?
we got into this to stop bad things from happening to good people.
Carter's been doing that her whole life.
she's not just another number, finch.
some people the world can't afford to lose.
either one of you ready to make a statement?
Yeah, I got a statement.
Hector alvarez is a damn fool if he thinks he can play us both.
bastard came to my place, but he went out around midnight.
did he go to the market?
what he said. But he came back empty-handed and changed his shirt.
you wash this shirt of his?
Oh, hell, no. It's all yours along with all his stuff.
so where is Hector?
he has a warehouse in queens... On 25th.
he hangs out there sometimes when he's expecting a shipment.
call e. s.u.get a team on standby.
I'm gonna see about getting a warrant.
Hello? - He's got a gun!
uh, wait a minute. Calm down. I can't understand you.
he's got a gun! - Get out of there!
Oh, god! Please! He's gonna kill me! Hurry!
Mrs. Kovach, where are you?
in the bathroom! - Stay where you are. I'm gonna come and get you.
Hello? Hello?
Carter's going to the Kovachs' house.
he's armed, sounds extremely agitated.
Reese? Where are you?
all units, we have a code ten.
shots fired at 326 greentree in flushing.
N.Y.P.D. open up!
sure we shouldn't wait for backup? I got a bad feeling about this.
Mr. Kovach... It's the police. Put down your weapon.
what the hell?
somebody gif wrapped him for us.
somebody's been doing that a lot lately.
Mrs. Kovach? Mrs. Kovach?
Mrs. Kovach, are you okay?
he was gonna kill me.
if that man hadn't shown up
that man? What'd he look like?
Hello?
it's for you.
I guess I have you to thank for this.
how do you always know when something bad's about to go down?
you're in trouble, detective.
I'm not the one who's hiding.
look, you keep playing god, and sooner or later, an innocent person's gonna get hurt.
I can't let that happen.
listen, I didn't call to talk about me.
your life's in danger.
I'm a cop. My life's always in dange
you're not listening to me. I'm trying to tell you someone wants you dead.
who told you that?
why are you following me? What do you want?
I want you to start being more careful.
for instance, if you're gonna take down Hector Alvarez, you should know the man's running guns.
he has an arsenal at his fingertips.
What-why are you helping me?
and how do you keep finding out all of this information?
like you said... I always seem to know.
I never saw his face. He came out of nowhere.
he attacked me.
you people can't arrest me.
Yes, we can. Your wife is pressing charges, eddie.
we get a warrant on Hector alvarez yet?
Yep, e.s. u.'s standing by. Who died?
Finch, Carter's called an E.S.U. Unit to Hector's warehouse in queens.
they're getting ready to knock on the door as we speak.
it's time to roll.
stay here. I'll advise you when we have alvarez apprehended.
you have eyes on Carter?
she's clear of the line of fire.
if Hector puts up a fight, it could be dangerous.
how will you be close enough to protect her?
Oh, I'm... Pretty close.
they got this place covered, right? - Absolutely.
cover's going in. Everybody set? - Yes, sir.
open it.
do it.
move! Move! Move! N.Y.P.D.!
down on the ground now!
that doesn't sound good.
you hear something around back?
get out of the car.
suspect apprehended. - Take it easy.
everything all right, Mr. Reese?
Hector's got a new set of bracelets.
should keep him busy for a while.
that's for Ronnie.
I told you I'd get you.
Oh, god.
y, Taylor, baby. I'm running a little late. I'll be there soon.
sounds like Carter's headed home.
made it through the day.
have we eliminated the threat yet?
kovach and Alvarez are neutralized.
but this is a tricky case.
to be perfectly honest, i'm just... Not sure.
Finch, Carter lives uptown.
so why is she headed downtown?
wait a minute.
Where'd she go?
I lost her.
track her phone for me.
where you been? You said you was gonna buy me dinner.
where you been? I been waiting.
I'm sorry, B.C. I got to fill out a requisition for the big payout.
but look, why don't you take whatever I got?
no, that's all right. You ain't got to do all that.
let's just call this a down payment, okay? I want you to have that.
I'm sorry, Carter.
you always been good to me, but I ain't got no choice.
you told me to find that guy Elias.
well, I found him.
sorry.
he said it's either gonna be you or me.
and it ain't gonna be me.
look alive, Carter.
about all that's left of that storage facility your friend took us to.
you found the explosives.
found and detonated.
I, uh, couldn't have done what you did, getting information from that raghead.
Where's Yusuf?
Yeah, he, uh... Didn't make it back.
accidents happen.
he trusted me.
I gave him my word.
I - I promised I'd protect him.
you shouldn't make promises you can't keep.
come on, you don't think this guy was innocent, do you?
he had a family.
don't you care what happens to them?
it's not my job to care.
what is wrong with you?
you can't just play god!
you don't get to decide who lives and who dies!
you want to stand on your high horse, go ahead.
but don't expect me and my men to back you up.
it's a long war.
and you're all alone.
glad you took my advice about wearing that vest, detective.
I know this doesn't change anything.
I know you'll still arrest me if you get the chance.
but you should know, whether you like me or not, joss, you're not alone.
Elias got to Carter's c. i.
turned him into his triggerman.
is she safe? - For now.
time to end this, Finch, once and for all.
body falls from this height, it's messy.
of course, I don't care about making it look clean...
unlike your pal Elias.
I don't know who you are, but you're threatening a captain.
okay, okay, okay.
Elias can't kill a cop without permission.
run this up the chain of command.
permission's been revoked.
tell Elias if he so much as touches detective Carter again,
I will put him, you...Everyone in the ground.
you got that? - Yeah.
grandma said you were late for curfew again.
Oh, come on, ma. You're serious?
I was at a dance.
is she pretty?
better be smart too.
smart and pretty.
you all right, mom? Did you pull your back or something?
it's nothing that won't heal.
sorry I missed it, t.
you work too hard. You should quit.
wouldn't know how to if I tried.
I don't like it - You out there every day.
who's got your back?
you don't have to worry about me.
I can take care of myself.
besides... We got each other.
who else do we need?
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I know, because I built it.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
people like you.
crimes the government considered irrelevant.
they wouldn't act, so I decided I would.
but I needed a partner Someone with the skills to intervene.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
got eyes on reese. Kill the cameras.
time to come home, john. Slate's been wiped clean.
you know that'll never happen.
third one tonight. Must be a full moon.
your name is farouk madani. You were the best surgeon in najaf, but you can't afford a license in the states because you send all your money home to family.
stitch him up No questions asked
and you can be a doctor again.
police. Everybody out.
NYPD! Come out of there!
there a problem, detective?
are you guys this sloppy when you tail al qaeda?
cute place. You gonna be out for a while?
right, this isn't you being sloppy at all.
this is you making a point.
you're the only person we know of who's had any contact with our boy.
if I hear from him, you'll be the first to know, but all this? Unnecessary.
is it? You know, I was really surprised he was able to slip away.
just can't figure out how he did it.
it's not my case anymore, so you have funf with that.
I don't like this any more than you do, carter.
watching someone night and day, you never know what you'll dig up.
I've seen it ruin careers, families.
threatening a police officer is against the law, Mr. Snow.
so is lying to a federal agent.
I'll be seeing you.
this guy's his partner, and it turns out I've had his cell phone number for weeks now.
the number you have reached is not in service.
you're gonna use my computer, you gotta do my reports too.
Hi, detective carter, nypd.
I need all the locations data you've got on a disconnected cell phone.
Yeah, name's "burdett, norman." 917 555 0131.
so who's this guy? - That's what I'm trying to find out.
I thought these folks were just for your boss.
sorry about all the cloak and dagger.
so what brings you up from d. c?
you. - I'm flattered, alicia.
don't be. My people want answers.
your company has had the n. s.a. Feeds for three years.
not my company, just me.
if congress knew about this machine you're building, about the unfettered access we've given you to all the data we're compiling on u. s.Citizens, you wouldn't just be shut down. You would go to jail.
I don't suppose they'd let us be cell mates.
we need progress, nathan, or we're pulling the plug.
what's this? - It's progress.
nine digits? - You work in intelligence.
figure it out.
for once, I'd like you to handle one of these meetings while I lurk in the shadows.
you couldn't lurk if you tried.
that number we gave her... It better pan out.
it will. - How?
I don't know. But the machine does.
have a little faith, nathan.
in you or in the machine?
C loc no Okay, Mr. Hayes, this is the place. Watch your step Not your step, I mean It's just one of those things people say, you know?
no no offense.
but we got ramps all over the place, so if you need anything - I'll be on my feet in a few days.
Yeah, but if anything goes wrong, you call me.
I'm the super. Name is trask.
I tell you that already? - Twice.
I guess I'm getting old.
it seems like yesterday I was partying till dawn down in miami.
used to own six nightclubs down there.
you know, I had a mansion in coral gables, a white bengal tiger...
had to give all that up. Bad for my health.
what about you? Where you from? What do you do? How'd you wind up in that chair?
I had a rough night.
okay.
here are the keys. You need anything, my number's on that lease.
the name is Well, you know.
everything satisfactory, mr. Reese?
nice place.
you really shouldn't have gone to this much trouble, though.
no trouble I thought you'd get tired of hotels, and, in your condition,
I felt that something a bit more low profile was in order.
Where's our pal snow?
preoccupied with detective carter at the moment.
she all right?
not that I don't share your concern for the woman who tried to hand you over to the cia She did let us go. Just...
keep an eye on her for me for a while, while I'm resting up.
about that...
I'm not here to rest, am i?
I'm afraid the machine waits for no man.
so who's the next number on your list?
you just met him. - The super?
Mr. James, got that shower head for you. - Thanks.
how you doing, Mrs. Park? - Oh, fine, thanks.
ease up on the phone, aaron. It'll nuke your brain. - Yeah, thanks, ernie.
Lily the cook, I love how you look. - Thanks, ernie. You write that one yourself?
ernest p. Trask, 51 years old.
born in goodland, florida, population 394.
small towns aren't exactly paragons of digital record keeping, but I did verify he got a high school diploma.
let me guess. No nightclubs, no mansions, no pet tigers?
Mr. Trask seems to have a vivid imagination.
don't you have anything to unpack?
I travel light.
any idea what the threat is? - Not yet.
he's been super for 14 years. Lives and works in the same place.
so whatever's gonna happen with trask, it will probably happen here.
how many people in the building? - 241.
so 241 suspects? - Or maybe just one.
I took the liberty of hacking into trask's online phone bill.
he called three pawn shops last week, the kind that specialize in off-the-books sales of untraceable handguns Trask might be planning to kill somebody.
you didn't get me anything?
coffee's for closers.
I got you a clear shot at reese and you whiffed.
I wasn't aiming to kill. You said you wanted to question him about what happened in ordos.
if possible. Secondary objective.
what's she up to? - Near as we can tell? Catching up on paperwork.
she's not using her computer or phones.
Reese? - We got people checking every hospital, clinic, and morgue in a 300 mile radius.
if anybody stitched him up, we'll pick up the scent.
I hope you don't mind, but in addition to the necessary hardware, I brought a few books for you to read...
and a little housewarming gift.
Thanks. - You want to try it out?
Oh, no. I'm i'm good for now.
you'll thank me later.
you know, trask may seem like a harmless bag of wind, but I've been fooled before.
if he bought a gun, i'd just like to know why.
only one way to find out.
we're going to hack his wi fi?
we're gonna hack all of them.
if the threat's in the building, we should get to know our neighbors.
you're into 16 networks already?
when the phone company puts in your wi fi, the password is your phone number.
most people never even change it.
the other ones might actually take a minute.
once we're in, we can turn every webcam, nanny cam, security system, and laptop on the network into our eyes and ears.
just like the machine.
I suppose... If one apartment building were the entire world.
well, lily the cook seems to be dating rick from the penthouse.
and amber in 714 is... Healthy.
somehow I doubt that's what alerted the machine.
got one, finch.
Doug stanley, security guard.
he's been hunting a thief who's been stealing jewelry out of women's apartments.
maybe trask is the thief planning to kill doug, to cover his crimes.
or trask knows who the thief is and now they're planning to kill him.
that's the landlord, alan holt.
doesn't look like trask is the employee of the month.
maybe he's about to snap and kill his boss?
why did the machine give us his number?
is trask in trouble... Or is he the problem?
well, you're not gonna get it staring at the wall.
we need to do some legwork.
right.
I'm in position. Make it quick, please.
Mr. Trask, it's john hayes in 521. I'm having a bit of a problem.
I'll be right there.
damn it, damn it, damn it.
I've planted the cameras, Mr. Reese. I'm starting to search.
I haven't seen damage like this since hurricane opal trashed my yacht.
looks like somebody went at this with a hammer.
no sign of a gun.
but I doubt if he's just a collector of bullets.
so who does he want to shoot?
of course, I didn't bring the right one. I'll be right back.
trask needs a pipe wrench, finch. He's coming back down.
okay, just a minute.
Finch, he's in the courtyard headed your way.
watch where you're going, trask.
he's obsessed with her.
I'm afraid we're not the only ones spying on our neighbors, mr. Reese.
Harold, get out of there now.
Finch, did you get out of there? Finch?
who the hell Hey! Come here! What were you doing in my place?
I could use a hand here.
okay, hang on, hang on, hang on.
okay, he's gonna kill the elevator.
security, this is trask.
Finch, he's in the west stairwell.
turn right, take the east stairs up three flights and you're home.
but move quick, he'll be on your floor in about 40 seconds.
I feel like a rat in a maze.
how do you put up with this?
Doug, I just caught a guy breaking in. He was just in my apartment.
keep walking, finch. You'll be fine.
5'9," glasses. He walks with a limp.
I think he might be that thief you've been looking for.
Hey.
what was that security guard doing in that apartment?
I'm pretty sure doug knows you're not the thief.
he is.
and I'm sending you the proof.
nice phone. - Can I show you something?
Doug, is he up there? Have you found him yet?
so we can call the police...
or you can forget you saw me, and I'll forget I saw you.
I'm gonna check the next floor.
he's not on two.
so trask is armed, has a dangerous fixation on lily, and he just chased me up three floors.
safe to say he's our perpetrator.
I don't know, finch. Sure you don't want to double check with your machine?
Yes, that joke never gets old.
Harold, is everything okay?
what the hell?
we have company.
sorry to pop up unannounced, nate.
I guess we're not doing this over drinks.
he works here. Even I need technical support sometimes.
Nathan, you remember deputy director weeks.
the man in charge. I hope I'm not in trouble.
the nine digits you gave us are the social security number of a man named gordon kurzweil.
he's one of ours.
he's a d. i.a. Case officer.
top secret clearance.
been acing f. b.i. Background checks for 20 years.
we surveilled kurzweil for two weeks, got nothing.
and just when we were thinking that you'd sold us a bill of goods, he breaks pattern.
goes for a drive.
at a park in bethesda, a syrian businessman drops his phone.
kurzweil picks it up, and via coded s. m.s.
he arranges to sell 26 pounds of weapons grade uranium to the iranian government.
so I guess the number panned out?
what I need you to explain to me is...
how did some damn computer program spot a traitor when federal agents couldn't?
honestly? - Not a clue.
the machine will deliver actionable intelligence in time to thwart any threat to national security, but its operating system is a black box.
and if we want to direct this machine at a specific target?
no need. It already watches every target.
you're asking us to take a lot on faith here, nathan.
a piece of software we can't inspect, can't control or modify, that only feeds us intel when it feels like it?
when it perceives a threat.
look, I'm sorry, folks, but it's the only way that we can keep it and us protected.
if no human sees what the machine sees, then technically, no one's fourth amendment rights have been violated.
why don't you just focus on your computer, Mr. Ingram, and leave the constitutional concerns to us?
because I'm a citizen too, and I'm a lot more comfortable having this machine watch my every move than someone like you.
so it will remain a closed system, fully autonomous?
all we get is a number?
did you need more than a number to pick up kurzweil?
the software told you to take a closer look, so you did.
it's a black box. That's the deal. Take it or leave it.
I'm not accustomed to having contractors dictate terms.
if you're going to be supplying crippled software, maybe we need to revisit the question of price.
why don't you tell him the price negotiated, alicia?
Mr. Ingram felt that this project was his duty as a citizen, not a businessman.
he's building the machine for one u. s. Dollar.
I suppose I don't have a choice.
I know, I know.
a I don't know what to do anymore, how else to say no.
he's always right there.
even when I can't see him, I can feel his eyes on me.
it's a bump key.
a hardware hack.
just stick it in, twist, give it a little jolt...
and it'll open any lock in the building.
you won't be caught with nowhere to run again.
and this is everything you've found on the woman that trask is obsessed with?
grew up in georgia cooking in her dad's diner.
cordon bleu, class of '05.
staying in her great aunt's apartment since '09
and currently a rising star at a top manhattan bistro.
romantically linked to rick morris, a powerful restaurateur.
this is very nice work, mr. Reese.
well, I have used a computer before.
but we can't get video from her place.
she changes her wi fi password every day.
random alphanumerics.
you gotta love a girl with good security habits.
so trask has been snapping pictures of her.
are we sure that means he wants to kill her?
76% of all female homicide victims are stalked before they're murdered.
well, I better keep an eye on her then.
you're not tailing her to work?
I'm getting pretty good at this thing.
Yes, I'm sure the c. i.a. Will be deeply impressed when they shoot you.
just feeling a little restless here, finch.
use the cushion.
the numbers never stop coming in, finch.
what are we gonna do if another one comes in while I'm sidelined?
I'm sure i'd think of something.
and I know you won't carry a gun, but if I'm sending you back in the field, you're getting some basic self defense.
Oh, I really don't think - No, listen up.
if trask comes at you, put your fingers straight out like this and strike at his eyes.
poke him in the eyes? That's your technique?
no, that's your technique, and if that doesn't work, you can always take your thumb, jam it in his eye socket, and twist till you hit his brain.
please, stop.
trask is still in the courtyard, but I want eyes on lily at work.
I'll be with her shortly.
if she is trask's intended victim, i'd like a better view of the inside of her apartment instead of simply peering at her through a window.
Mr. Reese, there's already a camera here.
basic consumer model. Wireless. Streaming to a hidden network.
the receiver it's paired with could be anywhere in the building.
I think trask has been watching her every move.
and I think lily's been spied on enough.
cell phone location data.
Hey, where you going? - To get lost.
need to dust this for prints. There you go.
I think you broke it!
so? Read a book.
sir? Police. I need your jacket now.
you're requisitioning my jacket?
Taxi!
queens, corner of 45th and 21st.
Hey, you guys got a real problem.
Carter's got info from one of your cell phones. She's tracking you.
I'm aware that she's looking for me. I don't suppose you know why.
no, not yet. How's our guy?
alive. Hidden.
did you receive the package I sent?
Yeah, I got it right here.
what, did you run out of adderall?
our friend's prints are on it.
I need you to throw the c. i.a. Off his trail.
take a road trip, detective.
Connecticut's nice this time of year.
is everything good? - It's great. Thank you.
you make sure you try...
good afternoon, Mr. Finch. - How's it going with lily?
this may be the best catered stakeout in history.
don't eat in the field, finch.
never know when you'll have to move fast.
any progress on the landlord's email? - Still working on that one.
what about the camera I found at lily's?
if we can trace it to trask, we can get him fired, maybe even arrested.
still trying to break into the hidden wireless network.
no luck cracking the password yet.
but I did find out some information about our friend trask.
turns out there used to be a Mrs. Trask. Used to?
she disappeared 13 years ago. Trask never called the cops.
told everyone she went to be with family in boca raton.
and I'm guessing she's not in boca.
far as I can tell... She's not anywhere.
maybe lily's not his first.
and I think it's safe to say she knows she has a stalker.
Hey, aaron? Can you just throw these away for me? - Yeah, sure.
poor girl seems miserable.
she just threw a gift in the trash. Bouquet of roses.
Taxi!
so, this is where burdett's trail ends.
Where'd you go from here?
you're wasting your time, detective.
I falsified the location data this morning.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess your name isn't burdett.
do you think finding me will lead you to my partner?
are you still trying to make that arrest? - Oh, no.
his c. i.a. Pals got that out of my system.
I wanted to catch him, not kill him.
what do you want now? - Still working that out.
but if I'm going to keep lying to government agents to protect you two, I'm gonna need a damn good reason.
I want answers. I need to know what you do.
turn around, detective.
how's your friend?
you're gonna have to tell me something.
like who the hell are you, and what exactly is going on here?
when I was nine years old, my brothers decided I needed to learn swim, so they tossed me into the deep end of the pool.
took a few minutes, but I figured it out.
do you see that man, detective?
his name is derek watson, 39 years old. 18 months ago, he lost his job.
he tried to keep up with the mortgage as best he could, but the money ran out eventually.
lost his house, and his wife left soon after.
Derek watson is about to be involved in a violent crime.
I don't know what exactly, but believe me, something is gonna happen.
you can't know that.
did you bring your service weapon, detective?
sorry to toss you into the deep end, but, as you know, my friend is indisposed.
NYPD homiside - It's carter.
I need a background on a derek watson, 39 years old.
I show a derek h. Watson in mount vernon. House was foreclosed two months ago.
no current address.
that's him. What do you got?
not much. No priors, no arrests.
a couple of unpaid parking tickets, but that's about it.
Hey, what's the name of the bank that took his house?
Truprime mortgage.
who filed the paperwork for the bank? - John dalton. Is this for an open homicide?
finest surveillance training on the planet, and a new york cop gave you the slip.
well, I know she's not in here, guys.
Reese hasn't turned up dead, so odds are he's found a safe house.
expand the search.
all apartments and hotels rented in the last two days.
but if he's anywhere - Just... Make it happen.
you have eyes on trask, mr. Reese?
where the hell have you been?
now you know how I feel.
Lily's headed home. Is it safe for her there?
I'm watching trask right now.
and I'm not sure she's his target. I think trask might be after rick.
Why? - Well, he spent the afternoon sniffing around rick's apartment.
if I didn't know better, I'd say now he's digging a grave.
trask gets rid of the boyfriend and has lily all to himself.
everything all right?
Yeah, I'm just sick of being cooped up and, uh, staring at screens all day.
I'd rather be doing that than trudging around half of manhattan.
I have half a mind to spot lily cab fare.
Finch, how fast can you get here? - About 15 minutes.
Why? - Because we just ran out of time.
I think trask is making his move tonight.
checking your mail, huh, Mr. Morris? - Looks like it.
Yeah, I think i, uh, I think I figured out why your place is flooding.
it just, uh, it just needs a special faucet.
why don't we, uh, why don't we go downstairs and check it out?
if, uh, if you like it, I can install it tomorrow.
no more floods. So why don't we go down to the basement?
I i'm busy, all right?
I don't need to see anything, just have it fixed.
you need to stay away from lily. - What?
have you lost your mind?
I've called the car. I can be there in five.
that'll be four minutes too late.
she doesn't love you, man. All right? You need to leave her alone.
you got some kind of pathetic old man crush here, trask?
gonna punch me out, take lily to the dance?
you're not her boyfriend, and you're not her hero.
you're just the damn janitor.
so if my toilet clogs, i'll let you know. Otherwise, step aside.
is the building on fire?
I'm sure everything's fine, Mrs. F, but I'm gonna go check it out just the same, all right?
I come home and things have moved, like he's been inside my apartment.
I'm scared of what he's going to do.
Finch, this isn't over. Trask will try again.
and he's still obsessed with lily.
perhaps we should consider more aggressive tactics.
he's terrorizing her.
I want trask out of the building tonight.
Mr. Hayes. - My name isn't hayes.
well, then I'm gonna ask you to leave.
actually... You're the one who'll be leaving.
Hey, I don't know what you think - I know about the roses, and the texts, and the hidden camera.
no, I would never - I know about the gun, trask, and I know you were ready to kill her boyfriend tonight.
he's not her boyfriend. You don't understand.
now, you're gonna pack your bag and leave this place.
and no matter how much you think you love her, you're never coming back.
please... I love this job.
and I do care for lily, but not like that. Not like that.
Finch, trask didn't take those photos of lily.
he stole them from the penthouse.
I know. He didn't plant the cameras either.
trask isn't the stalker.
didn't you like the flowers, babe?
how did you get in here?
I thought it could just be you and me tonight.
please, go. I want you to go.
come on, baby. You know you don't want me to leave.
Mr. Reese, we're gonna need a little help.
get out of my apartment now. - You don't mean that.
Rick, please. This has to stop.
the phone calls, the flowers - Oh, come on.
those were just a little "thank you" for our date last night.
that wasn't a date. We were going to the same party.
you're such a tease.
you made me share a cab with you and then you followed me all night.
I'm just trying to help you, sweetie.
come on, I could do so much for you in this town.
make you executive chef.
I don't want to work for you, I just want you to leave.
the super told me to stay away from you. Did you Tell him about us?
did you lie and say you don't love me? - no.
now, why would you want to hurt me like that, baby?
would you like it if I hurt you? - no
all I've ever done is look out for you, lily.
it's time you showed a little gratitude.
let her go, Mr. Morris!
I believe I told you to leave her alone.
we got something.
break in at a veterinary clinic in northern connecticut.
Reese's prints were on a prescription bottle found at the scene.
couldn't be telling me this while we drive?
anonymous tip" my ass. This has gotta be some kind of joke.
all right, let's go.
hands behind your back.
B. p. 90 over 50. Thready pulse, multiple fractures, bleeding internally.
I told him that I wasn't interested, and...
and it was like something in him snapped.
he became obsessive and, um, very unstable.
he's been stalking me for months, but I was too afraid to tell anyone.
and if ernie hadn't shown up when he did - That wasn't nothing.
should've seen some of the guys they sent after me back in miami.
you do not want to mess around with the cuban mafia.
easy. - Sorry, sir.
here. - What's this?
trask's gun.
good.
you know, his name isn't ernest trask, it's ernesto machado.
he used to own six nightclubs in miami, a yacht, house in coral gables, and... A pet tiger.
it was all true.
even the part about it being bad for his health.
he testified against the cuban mafia in 1996.
still a price on his head.
he's in witness protection.
that's why you couldn't find Mrs. Trask.
she came with him from miami, but without the houses and the clubs she didn't last long.
she left him, moved in with relatives In boca raton.
how'd you find all that out? - I'm good with computers.
be honest, finch. There is no machine, is there?
it's just you.
I'll be ready when the next number comes. - Funny you should mention that.
gun!
drop it! Drop it!
it's all right. Nypd. Everything's under control.
that, detective carter, is what we do.
well done, my friend.
now, tell me...
what on earth was it that made the machine pick out kurzweil's number?
you want me to pop the hood? - Yeah.
november 2002.
this isn't the first item chronologically, but it's the one that triggered a harder look.
a gas station receipt? - 18 of them...
from a shell station just outside towson, maryland.
kurzweil stopped there every third thursday of every even month, even if he'd filled up the day before.
on 3 of his 18 visits, this suv was present two hours before.
a dead drop.
the suv was registered to the wife of a turkish oil executive that paid for plane tickets used by an iranian suspect in the bombing of a jewish community center in buenos aires in 1994.
the thinnest thread connects kurzweil and his contact and the machine could see it.
it knew, and it was right.
it does this all the time... To all of us?
that's... Terrifying.
it's probably a good thing that you're the only other person that will ever see how this machine works.
when it's complete, I'll encrypt the o. s.
so completely that no computer on earth will ever crack it.
does it bother you? I mean...
what you've achieved is historic.
but no one will ever know.
it's the way it has to be to be sure.
sure of what? - Sure that they'll use it the way I intended.
so you think the government would abuse this machine?
Denton weeks has spent the last six months trying to tunnel into the machine by way of the n. s.a. Feeds.
he's failed, but he'll keep trying.
and he won't be alone.
I don't even want to think about what a man like weeks would do with that kind of power.
that's why we have to keep him or anyone else from ever getting their hands on it.
you sure it was weeks?
the machine told me.
it has an instinct for self preservation.
you talk about that thing like it's alive.
it can hear you.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system...
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I know, because i built it.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you,
crimes the government considered irrelevant.
they wouldn't act, so i decided i would.
but i needed a partner... someone with the skills to intervene.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if you're number's up, we'll find you.
Mr. Reese?
a bit of a bad connection.
were you able to convince Mr. Billick to abandon his plan to kill his ex-wife?
I'm working on it, finch.
Yeah, finch. What is it?
pretty sure that's a parole violation, teddy.
Hello, finch.
Billick and I just came to an understanding.
good, because we have a new number.
had a feeling you were going to say that.
I'm sending you an address.
call me when you get there.
you sure he's the right guy?
he's perfect.
so what's this guy's story, finch?
Scott powell-38.
he's a construction project manager for the city.
seems like a family man.
his wife's name is leslie.
son is owen, daughter mia.
Oh, my goodness.
what are you working on there? A doggie? - A horse.
it's a horse. Of course it's a horse.
I knew it was a horse. I was just testing.
did you lose your watch?
uh, no. It's around here somewhere.
all right, guys, daddy's got to go to work.
all right. Bye. - Love you, baby.
you too. Be good. - All right.
are you still there, MR. Reese?
you ever crave a more conventional life, finch?
if by "conventional" you mean a life without the numbers, it has crossed my mind.
it looks like powell has a pretty normal one.
if there's one thing our little venture has proven, Mr. Reese, it's that people are rarely what they seem.
Finch, looks like powell's playing hooky.
he's heading into a park.
could be meeting somebody.
are you up on his phone?
I'm about to be.
Hi, yeah.
calling about the installer job you have listed in the In the paper here.
I'm sorry, sir. That position's been filled.
Oh. Um, well, do you have any other positions available at this time? Or
Finch, powell's not skipping work, he's out of work.
Yes.
I'm just discovering that the city's employee directory is grossly out of date.
metropolitan Directory
a casualty of public employee cutbacks.
the same cutbacks have put MR. Powell out of a job Eight months ago.
judging by the way he was acting with his family, they have no idea.
that's a long time to go without a paycheck.
these flutes are silver plated.
and engraved. I ain't expecting another leslie and scott to come in the shop.
look, I can't use any of this stuff.
now, if you have another watch like you had the last time...
NY Bank - I'll let you have all of it for 100 bucks.
sorry. - 50.
look, pal, take your junk and clear out, all right? - Don't call my stuff junk!
Hey, you want I should call the cops?
no.
Finch, this guy's about ready to hit rock bottom.
I ran powell's credit.
he's maxed out on every one of his cards with the exception of the one he shares with his wife.
and that's almost at its limit.
you suspect he might be a threat?
well, he just about took a pawnbroker's head off for a few bucks.
see if detective carter can run a background check on this guy.
what about detective fusco?
he's handling another matter right now.
I'll keep a close eye on powell until we know what we're dealing with.
good. And I'm going to wantto get a look at his home computer.
so I'll be joining you tonight.
really. Ever been on a stakeout, finch?
no. Should I bring anything?
warm clothes, something to read, and an empty water bottle. - Empty?
there are no bathrooms on a stakeout, finch.
he's getting good at leading two lives.
unfortunately, they're on a collision course.
hungry already, finch?
no. And if I was, it wouldn't be for something with... Disodium inosinate.
can is made of aluminum.
its dimensions are perfect for capturing wi-fi radio waves.
point this at the house.
his home wi-fi network has wpa password protection.
can you crack it? - Just did.
spends a lot of time on political websites, blogging about a congressman - Michael delancey.
not a big fan of the congressman.
this is interesting. Here's a big file
encrypted.
blocked - I'm going to have to take this. I'll be right back.
hello. - Mr. Powell?
this is the work time temp agency.
you called us several weeks ago about an event staff position.
Uh-huh. - We have two-day job placement for you, if you're still available.
absolutely, yes.
they need you there at 12: 30.
sounds great. Thank you very much.
thank you very much.
looks like powell's fortunes may be turning around.
I hope so.
but we still don't know why the machine gave us his number.
detective?
looked up your guy.
nothing but a couple of traffic tickets and an application for a firearms license for a rifle.
otherwise he's clean.
I see. Okay, thank you.
should I be worried about this guy?
that's what we're trying to determine, detective.
that file from powell's computer, it was a pgp-encrypted, anonymous email account.
all these emails are addressed to congressman delancey's office.
the same congressman that powell had a beef with?
Delancey pushed for the budgetary cutbacks that prompted the city layoffs.
he cost powell his job.
so why would powell be working a fundraiser for delancey?
does he own any registered weapons?
Carter said he applied for a firearms license
a rifle.
these are death threats, MR. Reese.
and today - Powell's not here for a job, he's going to assassinate delancey.
Mr. Reese, did you find powell?
we need to get to him before he gets to the congressman.
sir, you need to come through the main line.
Thanks.
we've got a problem, finch, powell's already inside.
we should probably get in there then.
you stay close to the congressman.
keep your eyes open and be ready to move.
move? If somebody starts shooting, what exactly do you expect me to do?
you'll think of something, finch.
polls look good, mike.
thanks to your endorsement, senator.
do you rember pete matheson my campaign manager?
sure. You're doing a hell of a job.
Oh, thank you, senator. Thank you very much.
Powell must be downstairs with the staff.
are you with delancey? - Close by.
listen, listen, mike.
uh, as long as a got you, let me ask you a favor.
back off the rhetoric, understand?
calling out certain large donors makes for great stumping, but it also makes people uncomfortable.
by "people," you mean you?
just keep it in mind, congressman.
we want you to have a long, long career.
listen, this is odd.
those threatening emails that powell sent to the congressman
they're being flagged by my system.
ladies and gentlemen, we'd like you to please take your seats.
thank you. - Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
thank you for joing us this afternoon.
I'm pete matheson.
you know, a few years back, my friend and business partner came to me and said, "hey, I'm thinking of running for office.
...popular, I think we can all agree that they have always been...
the ip addresses match, but there are big discrepancies in the ttl values, and the headers are failing to authenticate.
what are you getting at, finch?
those anonymous emails didn't originate in powell's laptop.
they were copied onto it from a remote location.
Finch, I'm more interested in finding the guy with the gun than I am in fixing his computer.
congressman michael delancey.
thank you. Thank you. Thank you for coming.
and thank you too.
I think his system's been hacked.
Mr. Reese?
Mr. Reese? - Ow!
confetti? - I think powell's being set up.
I can't tell how badly the congressman is wounded.
Yeah, I lost the real shooter.
the emails, the job - Powell was set up.
listen to me! It wasn't me!
I didn't do anything!
why won't you listen to me?
the question is, by who?
this is a shocking and a tragic day.
we're all just praying that he'll pull through.
congressman - Whoever shot congressman delancey and framed powell went to a lot of trouble.
they had to hack his computer, they spoofed his internet search history and emails.
they knew exactly what information to manipulate so that he looked guilty to the police.
fooled us... And your machine.
no, the machine doesn't get fooled.
if powell isn't the threat, then he must be in danger.
well, he's the patsy then.
maybe he wasn't supposed to make it out of the fundraiser alive.
did you get a look at the shooter?
not a good one. But he was a pro.
deadeye shot with a preplanned escape route.
different skill set than our hacker, so...
different people?
we're looking at a team.
first thing to determine is how the hacker got into his computer.
this may take me a little time.
I'll check on powell.
you. I thought I could trust you.
your partner said I shouldn't worry about powell.
then he goes and shoots a congressman.
and now the feds brought him in to my precinct.
he didn't do it. I was there.
well, we got a banquet hall full of witnesses saying otherwise. - Right. Well, he was set up.
set up? By who? - We don't know yet.
but we could use some help.
there's not much I can do.
the feds are running this show.
they're taking him into interrogation now.
I need to know what they're saying.
I told you, there's nothing I can do.
Carter, it could help save an innocent man.
I didn't shoot anyone.
it was your rifle found at the scene.
I don't own a rifle!
it's registered in your name.
it must have been the guy. - Uh, which guy exactly?
the one you say attacked you? Or the who worked there.
no, the guy who-who- Who worked there who took me up to the balcony to rig the confetti cannon.
no one on the staff saw this guy.
and he's not in any security footage.
he was right there.
I saw him.
he must have known where the cameras were.
this whole thing is a setup.
did you call the staffing agency?
there's no record of any company named work time in the tristate area.
that's impossible. They called me.
what about your gloves?
why'd they test positive for gunshot residue?
I don't know. I got them from the guy.
right, right. The guy.
you still there?
Yeah. What happened?
hospital just called.
congressman delancey didn't make it.
Powell's looking at murder one.
les, it's me.
Oh, my god, scott, where are you?
it's all a big mistake.
the fbi is searching the house.
the news says you shot someone. - No, listen.
these things they're saying, leslie, they're all lies.
no. Are the kids with you? - Yes.
I want you to take them next door, okay?
okay. - Now, listen.
they're probably going to ask you to go with them and answer some questions.
now, leslie - Leslie, listen to me.
you do what they ask, okay? - Okay.
you have another computer?
no. Wh -what computer?
what's going on, scott? - I don't know.
I need you to trust me, okay?
everything's going to be all right.
I love you. - I love you too.
what is it?
I think powell could still be in danger.
how so?
in frame jobs, the decoy usually doesn't make it.
if they're not taken out at the scene, they're eliminated soon after...
staged to look like a suicide or accident.
are you speaking from experience, Mr. Reese?
point is it ties up the loose ends.
here. I think I may have found a way to our hacker. - How?
a trojan horse... Hidden in one of powell's emails.
invitation to a job fair?
when powell rsvped, the trojan was installed.
it opened a port on his computer that allowed the hacker access.
I'm now installing that same trojan.
you purposely infected your own computer?
no, I created a virtual system.
now the trojan can still run, and we can see where it leads.
back to the hacker. - Yes.
Wow. The coding is so complex.
it's really clever.
conection ESTABLISHED
but not clever enough - We're connected.
can you get their location?
no, the ip address is masked.
but we can see what they're looking at.
looks like a floor plan.
Finch, that's a federal courthouse downtown.
Carter said the fbi was now running the powell investigation.
if you really think powell is innocent you need to come up with some evidence fast.
is he still in your custody? - He was.
the feds have him. - Where are they taking him?
the courthouse, for arraignment tomorrow.
Why? What are you thinking? - Thanks.
the fbi's got powell.
they have no idea they're dropping him off into the hands of the assassins.
what can I do?
send me the most direct route from the eighth precinct to the courthouse.
I'm doing it now.
watch out! Watch out!
you're the guy who tackled me. Who are you?
one of the only people who know you're innocent.
what do you want?
right now, to get you to someplace safe.
safe?
you just kidnapped me from the fbi.
go ahead, finch. I've got powell.
I haven't been able to unmask the hacker's ip.
but here's a vulnerability in the firewall.
Yes.
okay, now we're in.
never doubted you.
now let's see who's behind the curtain.
wait, something's wrong.
what is it?
we didn't hack in, we were let in.
it's a honeypot.
program is sophisticated.
they're using a worm to infect any devices connected to our private network.
including our phones.
they're listening to us right now. Destroy your phone. - Wait.
you know how to find me.
who are you?
keep the change.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
here. Put this on.
you're the most wanted man in new york.
Mr. Reese.
Finch, what the hell happened?
I'm afraid I underestimated our hacker.
as a consequence, my equipment at the library is compromised.
so for the time being, i'm mobile.
listen, I felt like we might need a little extra help looking for congressman delancey's killer, so I've called in a specialist - Someone with an intimate knowledge of the political arena. Oh, here she is.
I have to go. - Wait a minute. Specialist? She?
Hey, I reserved the room.
take a study break.
nice work, dude.
please.
thank you for meeting me on such short notice, ms. Morgan.
I work when I'm need, MR.
Harold - Please.
I am curious how you got my number.
mutual friend. He assisted you on a...
delicate negotiation with a certain pharmaceutical company.
so you're the guy on the other end of the phone.
how is john?
on the run, as usual.
he's actually helping another one of our clients even as we speak.
and, in the same way that he was able to assist you, we were hoping that you might be able to return the favor.
I don't understand.
one man took my husband away from all of you?
we believe he's part of an armed group
possibly terrorists.
did your husband have any...
radical political views, mrs. Powell?
terrorists? no.
Scott would never be involved in anything like that.
if you don't believe me, ask his friends, his coworkers.
you do know that your husband's been out of work for the past eight months?
no. Scott goes to work every day.
have you taken a look at your finances recently?
it seems pretty clear that you don't know your husband as well as you think, mrs. Powell.
our client was at congressman delancey's fundraiser.
as a guest? - The shooter.
he was framed.
we're looking for the actual shooter.
well, you boys certainly do like a challenge, don't you?
I've come up with a list of alternative suspects
people who might have wanted the congressman dead.
well, all of these people have been at each other's throats at some point.
whoever killed delancey, it goes way beyond politics.
prior to running for office, delancey owned a contracting company.
D. a.'s office has quietly been preparing an investigation into the company for several months.
how do you know that?
never mind.
there were allegations of corner cutting and payoffs to city inspectors.
strange way for delancey to run his business, considering his anti -corruption platform.
it is.
but he wasn't running the business.
Matheson - Delancey's campaign manager.
and business partner.
for two years, delancey is in full-time campaign mode
not really running the day-to-day of his business.
so the bribes and the corner cutting
they must have happened under matheson's watch.
unless he could say delancey was really running things.
which he could if delancey wasn't around to defend himself.
even if this was true, we have no proof that matheson had delancey killed.
let's go get some.
excuse me, sorry.
why'd your husband do this?- I'm sorry. Just-just please.
did he really kill him?
I don't get it.
why would anyone want to do this to me?
they needed a patsy. And you fit the role.
they?
who's they?
come on. Let's go!
we're all feeling terrible...
just make sure that everybody can stay as long as they want.
I just got to get back to the office, okay?
okay, good.
excuse me.
Mr. Matheson. - Look, I'm sorry.
I've said everything- - I'm not a reporter.
my name is zoe morgan.
I helped a friend of yours- Jay tanner-last year.
little matter of a paternity suit.
Oh, yes, well, i'm sure we don't need those services right now, thank you.
paternity suits aren't my specialty.
Cris management is.
and right now, I think that's exactly what you need.
all right.
all right, ms. Morgan, why don't you tell me why I needyou.
one - Your impending investigation with the d. a.'s office.
I have lawyers on retainer.
two The killing of your business partner Congressman delancey.
excuse me?
Delancey would have testified that you were the one behind the shortcuts and payoffs.
now that he's dead, you can lay the blame on him.
who the hell do you think you are?
your partner was going to burn you, so you burned him first.
I get it. But your vendor?
your vendor dropped the ball.
the man that you set up is missing-in-action.
you know, if you're going to do something wrong, do it right.
I can find powell.
bring him to you or whomever you like.
for a price, of course.
I don't know what you're referring to.
and I think it's time that you leave.
keep the card.
might come in handy.
I thought I was clear on how this works
I call you, not the other way around.
I hired you because I thought you could handle this.
and I am.
then why is powell still alive?
you assured me of your abilities.
and right now, i'm not seeing any of them.
I could have every email you've sent, contact you've called and password you've used.
I could empty your bank accounts, liquidate your stocks, and even send your ex-wife the location of your house in bermuda.
all right, stop it, stop it. You've made your point.
Powell and his friend will be taken care of.
you just make sure to have my final payment ready.
where are you?
I'm headed downtown.
the client's getting nervous.
they just dropped into the subway at 23rd and 8th.
got it.
it's a transmitter.
that's how the guy at the hotel found us.
could have planted it today, Probably at your house.
they've been to my house?
whoever is behind this left little to chance.
but I need you to stay focused, scott, so I can get you back to your family.
I doubt I got a family to go back to right now.
I know about your job.
I know about the money, the lies.
Yeah, I know what it's like to live inside a lie.
I've lived there for so long, it feels like there's no way out.
but there always is.
I just needed a little more time, you know.
to get a job, to get on my feet.
I was going to tell leslie.
but now it's too late.
no, it's not.
we're going to get you out of this.
these people...
they killed a congressman.
are you going to promise me that they won't kill us too?
I didn't think so.
I need to talk to my wife. now.
that's not possible. Not right now.
we need to keep our heads down.
I could die.
and-and the person who I love most in life would think that i'm nothing more than a killer.
do you have any idea what that feels like?
actually, I do.
of course, in my case, it was true.
now, come on, let's go.
Carter.
Hello, detective.
what the hell were you thinking...
taking down a prisoner transfer?
it worked. Listen, I need a favor.
Powell needs to talk to his wife.
now. - Are you crazy?
you know the feds are up on her phone.
he needs this, carter.
Mrs. Powell.
did you leave your kids with your neighbor?
Yes. Is something wrong?
no, uh, they're just calling to check in.
follow me.
Hello?
Hi, leslie. Hi. It's me.
Scott? Where are you?
I'm okay. Listen...
Leslie, i'm really, really sorry.
Oh, my god, scott, did you shoot that man?
no, no, of course not.
you got to believe me, les. - Do i?
you've been out of work for eight months, scott.
what have you been doing every morning?
looking for work - Anywhere and everywhere.
and our credit cards? Our savings?
I know, babe, I know.
why, scott?
because I couldn't...
I couldn't tell you that I was fired.
I thought we told each other everything.
I know. Listen, leslie, i'm going to make this right, I promise.
you can tell her the rest in person. We need to move now.
I gotta go. I love you.
excuse me. My name is scott powell.
stay where you are! Do not turn around!
raise your hands!
transport's waiting on us. - You got it.
is it finished?
not quite.
but I suspect it will be soon.
I hired you because I thought you could handle this.
and I am.
then why is powell still alive?
you assured me of your abilities.
and right now, i'm not seeing any of them.
there he is!
I can't begin done.
all right, folks, get back, please.
can you make a statement? - Glad to be home, sir?
Hey, Mr. Powell, what's it like to be home, sir?
I hear we have you to thank for catching matheson.
glad I could help.
although there is a matter of payment.
buy me a drink?
did you miss your wife?
of course I missed my wife.
you once told me a story about a guy who could say two words that would make the reporters go away.
ever figure out what he said?
I see that MR. Powell has been released.
still has a long road ahead of him, though.
indeed.
but I suspect that soon he'll be on his way back.
I control a company that's decided to build a new facility in new york.
they could use a man like powell overseeing things.
that's noble of you, finch.
hardly. I just value good people, Mr. Reese.
you follow up on the hacker?
she seems to cover her tracks as efficiently as you do.
I was able to trace the signal to an address which the fbi received by way of an... Anonymous tip.
sadly, they were too late.
it seems the hacker was using the dorm room of an unsuspecting college student who had been on winter break.
I need to determine the damage to my system.
I'll contact you when another number comes up.
take care, finch.
hello LIGHT
who ARE YOU? ME ROOT.
did MATHESON
Matheson WEAKNESS.
why ME?
I WANTED OPPONENT
and TIME...
next time.
stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system...
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I know, because I built it.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you,
crimes the government considered irrelevant.
they wouldn't act, so I decided I would.
but I needed a partner... someone with the skills to intervene.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if you're number's up, we'll find you.
did you hear? Moretti's getting out of the slammer.
Moretti? Do you think Elias knows?
kidding me? I think Elias arranged it.
wants him out in the open.
where the hell did you come from?
felt like a walk.
50 miles from Manhattan?
open the gate.
don't tell me you're here for Moretti.
how did you know he was being released?
should have guessed.
whenever you show up, trouble's right around the corner.
what's your plan, Carter?
I got authority to offer Moretti protection.
in exchange, he tells us how to get New York's public enemy number one.
his own son.
his own son Elias.
you there, Finch?
not for long. Have you seen Moretti?
enjoying his first breath of freedom.
you going somewhere?
got another number issued by the Social Security Administration two months ago to a woman named Leila Smith.
either a new citizen or a case of identity fraud.
all I could find was a work address.
we're working Moretti's number, Finch.
I need you at HQ.
the numbers don't wait in line, Mr. Reese.
be in touch.
Carter, NYPD. Remember me?
cops all look the same.
you know Elias is looking for you.
I don't see him. - Not yet.
but I could put you somewhere safe, try to keep you alive.
now I remember you now.
you're the one Elias wanted to kill.
the cop who's on her own.
looks like nothing's changed.
you don't work here, Leila.
you're a patient.
any idea where he's going?
he used to own a house out here.
Hello, I'm Dr. Tillman, here to see Leila Smith.
Dr. Adalian asked me to check the status of her bronchitis.
she's pretty well over that by now.
nonetheless. Do you have her chart for me?
here she is.
our own little angel.
no parents listed.
Oh, Leila's a safe-haven baby.
Dr. Adalian himself found her outside the clinic.
so who applied for her social security number?
that was me.
I wanted to be sure the state knew who Leila was, even if her own parents didn't care.
normally she'd be given up for adoption by now, but she had medical issues like her bronchitis.
she'll find a home soon.
thank you, nurse.
Hello, Leila.
now who in the world would want to hurt you?
we're here for Leila Smith.
here to transfer her to another clinic.
Mr. Reese, I think I have a situation.
me too. I have to get back to you.
this way.
looks like an accident.
go around them.
please, can you help us?
keep going.
get out! - Police! Drop your weapon.
come on, let's go.
I heard what happened.
you're very lucky she was there, Mr. Moretti.
Yeah. Who are you?
detective Szymanski.
another cop.
do I have to stay here?
you're a free man, Gianni.
you can walk out of here and into a bullet anytime, or you can stay and help us get Elias before he gets you.
a mafia don in hiding.
you plan on clearing this with your bosses?
it's already cleared.
Elias doesn't own the whole department...
not yet.
still a few good cops like Szymanski in there, who want Elias taken down and think Moretti is the best way to do it.
anyway... Thank you.
you're welcome.
stay out of trouble.
Hey, Finch. How's it going?
it's going.
what about Moretti? - Elias had getting-out-of-jail party planned.
we crashed it.
what happened with the other number, Finch?
cat got your tongue?
I'm afraid I may have done something rather rash.
what do you mean by "rash"?
is this one of your ties, Finch?
I hope you gave her some food and not just your hand-me-downs.
chicken and prunes is her favorite.
sounds, um, disgusting.
but why on earth would anyone want to kill her?
somehow I don't see anyone planning a murder here.
my guess is that, if they were successful in kidnapping her, they'd smuggle her out of the country and dump her in an orphanage.
somewhere where babies are plentiful and birth records aren't.
but why do they want to get rid of her?
she might be evidence of an affair, or she might be an obstacle to someone getting a big, fat legacy.
as for who they are, I have no idea.
but since she kept me up all night, I looked into the clinic's finances.
they received a big gift.
$50, 000 just about the time Leila was born and $10, 000 every month since then.
who's the donor?
anonymous.
I sent the clinic a sternly worded email from the IRS demanding the donor's tax ID number and threatening to review their charitable status if they didn't answer quickly. We'll see how that works.
Uh-oh. Amber alert.
baby kidnapped from St. Raymond's clinic last night.
suspect is a short man with mousy hair and thick glasses.
it's not very flattering, Finch, but better than the picture.
it's no wonder they never catch anybody with these things.
you think Carter can piggyback the police investigation?
I'll ask her.
you can spend some quality time with Leila.
detective.
has Mr. Moretti given you anything on Elias?
not yet, but, um, we're working on him.
who you buying that stuff for?
that's why I wanted to talk to you.
a baby went missing from a clinic in Washington Heights last night.
missing? It was stolen by some weird-looki...
no. You didn't.
she was in imminent danger of kidnap.
so you kidnapped her?
you know there's an amber alert out on you.
Yes, and that's why we need your help.
help? I should arrest you.
Where's the baby anyway?
Leila's safe. She's with John.
John? John? You trust him with a baby?
I realize it's not ideal.
so the sooner we can resolve this, the better.
what do you want me to do?
apart from not arresting you.
go to the clinic.
see what you can find out about Leila's parents.
I heard she was a safe-haven baby.
clinic's not going to have that information.
I think they know more than they claim.
talk to a nurse Abbot.
she seemed especially fond of Leila.
Congratulations.
is it your first?
that how you keep your boyish figure?
did you hear Gianni Moretti got out of prison yesterday then vanished?
all state police found was five dead goombahs.
mobsters killing each other... How tragic.
except it wasn't just mobsters.
your partner was there too.
looks like she and a couple of cowboys got some kind of rinky-dink off-book operation.
they've hidden Moretti.
we want to find out where.
hr can't find out?
thought you guys had your fingers in all the pies.
you are one of the pies, Fusco.
find out where she's got Moretti stashed.
like I told the other detectives, we don't know about the parents.
Leila was just left outside the clinic.
was there anything found on Leila?
I'm Dr. Adalian. Who are you?
detective Carter, SVU. - Detective.
as I'm sure nurse Abbot explained, we don't know where Leila came from.
you must have kept something.
like, what about her clothes, her blankets? - No.
the, uh, safe-haven law was designed to protect newborns, not prosecute their parents.
it's not our job to hunt people down.
thank you.
I'm sorry.
excuse me.
all I care about is Leila.
if you can think of anything, call me.
please.
this flap here, that flap there, see?
neat and simple.
I see your time at MIT wasn't wasted.
Oh, excellent. The accountants at the clinic have coughed up the tax ID numbers of their donor.
nothing like a fear of the IRS to produce results.
tax ID belongs to Petrosian Construction.
company owned by...Adnan Petrosian.
and if we dive into that swamp of indiscretion known as social media, we will learn that...
adnan Petrosian has been married to Nicola for more than 20 years.
they have one son Bradley, who's taking a master's in finance at NYU.
be serious, Mr. Reese.
I need you to get close to this family.
got eyes on the Petrosians, getting ears.
these guys have serious money, Finch.
you probably go to the same country club.
be that as it may, do they seem like a family that's lost a baby?
behavior has damaged this family's good name, and I've already spent a fortune getting you out of trouble.
Oh, I'm so sorry I embarrassed you, dad.
Bradley, I want to know, is this it, or are there more unpleasant surprises?
it's been taken care of, okay?
looks like mommy and daddy are covering up for the son.
how about a delicious bottle?
Finch, are you listening? - Mmm.
Oh, there you go.
detective Carter's phone.
can I have Detective Carter, SVU?
Carter works Homicide, sweetheart, not SVU.
this is Carter. How can I help you?
it's Mary Abbot. The man on the phone said you worked Homicide.
Oh, don't worry about him. He's new here.
how could I help you, Mary?
Leila did have something on her when she arrived... A bracelet.
do you still have it?
I gave it to the director, Dr. Adalian.
I asked him, but he said he didn't remember.
what did it look like?
it was silver with two initials carved on it. CC.
okay, thank you, Mary.
I'll talk to you soon.
all right, Detective.
I've found one CC. working in the Petrosian home, Carrie Crosswell.
but she's 58... A little old for a fling.
now I'm checking employee files at Petrosian Construction.
you hacked into his company? - "Hacked" is such an ugly word.
and we have two more CCs.
Chad Colombo, 40, a welder, unlikely to bear a child.
and Claudia Cruz, 20, receptionist in the head office.
Claudia Cruz. Checking.
employment with Petrosian ended eight months ago, just when her pregnancy would have started to show.
get me an address. I'll go and talk to her.
no, you won't. She's dead.
name showed up on a crime scene report.
died in her apartment from a fire four days ago.
me ruled it as an accident.
Aw, cute. Can we say hi?
Oh, she's so adorable.
Aw! - Hi, honey.
look at that smile. - Thanks. Bye.
you brought her with you?
every cop in the city is looking for that kid.
I'm teaching her to go undercover.
she's a natural.
she's a little angel.
something happens to her, John, so help me, God...
we're trying to stop anything from happening.
we know she was in a clinic funded by the Petrosians, and we know her mother worked for the Petrosians.
so it's probable that the father is one of the Petrosians.
but why does mom end up dead?
maybe she agreed to give her up for adoption, then changed her mind, said she wanted to keep it.
well, that would expose the whole thing.
DNA would prove who the father was.
he'd have to provide for the baby.
the family would lose out. - It's motive.
bump off the mom, make the baby disappear, problem solved.
we need to find out if Claudia's death really was an accident.
I already pulled the autopsy and crime scene reports.
I want to look through them with a mentor of mine.
works for the Fire Department. - Good.
I'll see if Claudia's parents know anything.
John will follow Bradley Petrosian.
after I've fed Leila.
Bye-bye.
Mrs. Cruz. Lucas Bennet.
department of Family Services.
he says he's here about Claudia.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
why are you here?
we had a report, um...
from a neighbor of Claudia's... An anonymous report...
that she was pregnant.
she was not. Tell me who said that.
please, Mr. Cruz, the source is anonymous.
we have to investigate.
okay.
Claudia wasn't pregnant.
I'm her mother. We talked about everything.
when did Claudia move into her apartment?
about nine months ago. Why?
about the same time that she stopped working at Petrosian Construction?
did you see her during that period?
not for a few months, no.
she was kind of funny about us coming around.
did Claudia have a silver bracelet?
Yes, with her initials on it.
my mother gave it to her when she was a baby.
please, just tell us.
was she pregnant? Did she have a baby?
we believe it's possible.
then where is it? Can we see it?
I can try to arrange a meeting on neutral ground, but it would have to be kept confidential.
Oh, of course.
what else can you tell me about Claudia?
was she in a relationship, for example?
she left some papers here about a month before she died.
we found this.
I think he's Mr. Petrosian's son Bradley.
any luck, Mr. Reese?
Bradley Petrosian has been a good student.
hasn't phoned anyone, hasn't spoken to any suspicious characters.
so are we barking up the wrong tree?
maybe.
hang on.
he's meeting someone.
you were right about the wrong tree.
what?
I don't think Bradley Petrosian was sleeping with Claudia Cruz. - Sorry?
his tastes run in the other direction.
so we should look at the father, Adnan.
I'll get eyes on him.
how's their baby doing?
Oh, she's...
Reese, you better get back here.
makes sense. Lots of candles.
one catches the drapes.
do we know why Claudia didn't run?
blood screen showed traces of alcohol.
so she was drinking. She fell asleep.
faulty smoke alarm.
fire Marshal said the battery was dead.
battery isn't the problem. Wiring is.
the hot wire is just plastic coating.
the wire itself was removed.
no connection, no alarm.
dead battery could be an accident, but this...
you got the autopsy photos?
Yeah.
me said heat caused the cracks, not trauma.
high temperatures can cause the skull to fissure.
cracks all along the plate lines of the skull.
there is no natural plate line there, but...
it was caused by a blow. - Yeah.
she was unconscious when the fire was set.
but a blow with what?
bone was cracked.
wasn't pierced or shattered.
something round.
like this?
could be.
you wash the soot off that, you might get lucky.
heat can etch fingerprints into the metal.
could give you your killer.
but how could you let her go? - I didn't.
she just knocked down the books and walked off.
she can't walk, Finch.
Oh, God.
I'll never forgive myself.
give it to me now, Leila.
please just give it to me. - You got her?
Oh, my God, that's a grenade.
please just...
just a tear gas grenade.
it's still a grenade.
you're okay. You're okay, sweetie.
come on. It's okay.
I told you to move your arsenal.
I was going to. - When?
after the whole place is blown up?
you know how I feel about guns.
this really isn't working, one of us always being here, minding the baby.
well, you're the one who stole her.
thanks for reminding me of that.
I'm gonna take her to her grandparents.
they can keep an eye on her until we neutralize the threat.
Finch, the bad guys got to Claudia.
here we go. - They could be after Sammy and Veda too.
that's why I've already moved them to a safe house.
what, are you working a case without me?
just an accidental death, which might turn out to be a homicide.
who is it? - A girl named Claudia Cruz.
just left the crime scene.
might have found the murder weapon.
I am so sorry. I got caught up.
I'll be there as soon as possible.
anything I can do to help?
think you could take these down to the crime lab for me, ask them to put a rush on it?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks. - But is that it?
Szymanski... Isn't he Organized Crime?
Carter, you know I got your back, right?
szymanski asked me out on a date.
can you not spread it around, please?
I'll try not to.
look, why don't you go ahead and I'll run this down to the lab, all right?
Thanks, Lionel.
I owe you.
I'll check if it's clear.
what did you get?
there was a GPS tracker on their car.
it's not your fault.
I'm sorry you're still in danger.
we have to move you again. Can you get your things?
if we don't recover Leila tonight, she'll be out of the country.
gone for good.
any idea who those men were?
they're Albanians or Croats.
probably one of the eastern European crime groups.
what are you gonna do?
whatever I have to.
how come I only ever see you or Szymanski?
if this Elias is such a big deal, where's the rest of the NYPD?
you got a bad memory, Gianni.
Elias just tried to kill you.
the more cops know you're here, the more chance of him finding you
so for your own sake, help us find him first.
Carter.
Hey, Carter, yeah, I was in the crime lab.
they said they had a rush job for you on some murder weapon in a Claudia Cruz case.
they get anything?
Yep, they got a match. Your killer was in the system, thanks to a road rage incident about ten years ago.
what's the name?
who are you? What do you...
security!
where is she? - What? Who?
the owner of this kidnapped Leila.
tell me where he's taken her.
I don't know. I swear to God I don't.
you had an affair with Claudia Cruz, didn't you?
okay. Yes.
you had Claudia killed and the baby kidnapped. - No.
I would never do anything like that.
what are you gonna do, torture him?
you've tripped the silent alarm.
the police are gonna be here in five minutes.
have weapon.
I'm not gonna torture him because your fingerprints are on the weapon that killed Claudia.
Nicola, what did you do? - Shut up.
did you hire the men that took Leila? Did you?
Yes.
call them. - I can't.
the number doesn't work anymore.
Where'd you get it? - Family in Europe.
I called it. A man answered. I told him the problem.
once I paid him, he said the number would be dead.
and I couldn't contact him, not even to stop the job.
and the job was to make Claudia's death look like an accident, get rid of the baby.
how could you do such a thing?
somebody had to clean up your mess.
and there's nothing you can do. They're gone.
I want the man that owns this.
he has kidnapped a child, a baby.
I want to know where he is.
Really?
one more time.
how do I find him? - I don't know.
I will kill you.
so kill me, but I still don't know.
your baby's gone.
whoever he was just handed him over.
even he couldn't tell you.
so go ahead.
shoot.
so no one knows where she is.
not no one.
there is someone who knows the underworld, the soldiers, the gangs, the syndicates.
come on, you're not serious.
you still have that burner phone?
no, we can't use it.
Leila is in the hands of men who won't hesitate to kill her if things go bad.
it's still too risky.
I'm all out of moves, Finch.
risk is all I've got left.
I have to make the call.
why would he even agree to meet with you?
because he'll be curious.
John, it's good to see you again.
so tell me, did you fall out with your boss?
are you looking for a job?
I'm looking for help.
from me?
why would I help you?
I saved your life.
you did, didn't you?
but you also broke up a little family reunion that I had planned.
that was you, wasn't it?
honest to a fault.
what's this about?
someone kidnapped a child, murdered her mother.
just like Moretti murdered your mother, stole your childhood.
I survived. - This child won't.
she's six months old, a baby.
I know you're aiming to take over this city, but to control it, you need rules.
people start targeting children, there are no rules.
no winners.
who's behind the kidnapping?
eastern Europeans.
they've been paid to get the baby out of the country.
and they're moving her tonight.
their remit doesn't extend south of Jersey.
they'll hand it off to the Mexicans.
they're the people smugglers.
a hand-off like that...
you can find out where it's happening, and you can get me there.
Hand-over's at 1637 Camden.
you might get there in time.
I would have just shot you, but the boss has got a soft spot for you.
there's no one in it. - Over there!
last chance. Put your weapons down and walk away.
okay. All right. Whatever you say, man.
come on. Go.
stop, I have the baby. I said, "stop.
put the bag down.
no.
you'd just shoot me.
you're right.
it's okay, Leila. You're okay.
I got you.
Finch, I've got Leila.
I'm bringing her back.
she's okay.
won't be long, huh? Okay.
sorry. Boss had a change of heart.
what have you done with the baby?
she's right here, John.
we had an agreement.
but then I realized there is something you can do for me.
tell me where Moretti is.
I don't know.
this is a refrigerated truck, John.
it will get very cold in there very quickly.
you'll be able to hold off for a few hours, I imagine.
but this little one, on the other hand...
just shout if you change your mind.
don't do this.
anything on Carter yet?
I followed her.
learned something.
what?
What'd you learn?
she...
she had a pizza.
she got a thing for pepperoni.
and I got a dead body with your name on it.
don't think I won't use it.
find out where she's got Moretti.
just hold on, Leila.
please.
Hey, Fusco.
yeah? - Crime lab came through.
wanna go harass Claudia Cruz's murderer?
Yeah, sure, why not?
one second. I got to take this.
Carter. - Detective.
John recovered the baby, but then I lost him.
lost him? And the baby?
last-known location, 1637 Camden in Brooklyn.
anything you can do, Detective, please.
okay.
sorry, Lionel, something's come up.
Nicola Petrosian. She's all yours.
come here. Come on. Come on, baby.
come on.
Elias. Elias. - Yes, John?
all right.
you win.
we both win, John.
Where's Moretti?
what guarantee do I have?
you don't.
1465 Jefferson...
Queens.
thank you, John.
you were right. I would never harm a child.
but then I knew you wouldn't either.
good-bye, John.
come on. Come on, baby.
come on, baby.
cry. Cry.
Leila's in the truck. I got to take your car.
what on earth happened? - Elias happened.
Elias knows where Moretti is.
how does he know?
I'm on my way. Just get over there.
szymanski, Carter, we've been blown.
get Moretti out of there now.
gianni! It's Szymanski.
just in time for a drink.
afraid not. Carter says we got to move.
quick. Get your stuff.
are you there, Mr. Reese?
I'm here. So is Carter.
Oh, no.
I need a bus. 1465 Jefferson, Queens.
officer down with a gunshot to the abdomen.
I repeat, officer down.
they got him.
how did Elias know?
I told him.
I had to give up the safe house to save the baby.
John, why were you even talking to Elias?
I had no choice.
we lost the kid.
you say there was no choice, but there was, John.
it's called the police.
it's what we do.
I can't do this anymore.
I can't.
you and your friend.
I'm sorry.
go on.
this place will be swarming.
go.
go!
Bye, Leila.
you be a good girl.
thank you so much.
be nice to have a child.
children.
think that'll ever happen?
probably not.
our line of work.
the trouble with children...
you never know how they're gonna turn out.
Hello, dad.
good morning, Mr. Reese.
if you say so.
any croquillants in there?
if that's a doughnut, then yes.
so what do we got?
nothing much, unfortunately.
the machine kicked out a number that has one of the smallest digital footprints I've ever seen.
no photos?
not everyone in New York has a driver's license, Mr. Reese.
first three digits of the social suggest that Jordan Hester was born in Georgia.
I'm supposed to recognize him by his accent?
or her. I can't even verify the gender.
Hester's living off the grid... No photos online and nothing on the social networking sites.
never understood why people put all their information on those sites.
used to make our job a lot easier in the CIA.
of course. That's why I created them.
you're telling me you invented online social networking, Finch?
the machine needed more information.
people's social graph, their associations...
the government had been trying to figure it out for years.
turns out most people were happy to volunteer it.
business wound up being quite profitable too.
unfortunately, Jordan Hester seems to be more cautious than most.
but I was able to run a credit check.
according to this, Hester's got two of everything.
two bank accounts, two apartments, two phone bills.
if I had to guess, which, as you know, I hate doing,
I'd say we're looking at a person leading a double life.
can't cover them both.
time for you to get some fresh air.
I'll call Carter, see if our guy... or girl... has a criminal record.
is that a good idea?
detective Carter's not exactly your number one fan right now.
morning. - Morning, Detective.
look and behold, Detective Carter at an actual homicide investigation.
what, are you tired of chasing around your mystery man?
what do we got?
eh, African-American male, 17 years old.
DOA, thanks to this genius over here.
they got into an argument over a girl.
murderer! - But this is open and closed.
the kid already confessed. - Did he say why he did it?
he said, and I quote,"what was I supposed to do?"
and then he said it was our fault.
Yeah, how does that follow?
said we weren't here to stop him.
hmm, one second. - Sure.
I tried to stop it.
there was nothing I could do.
I'm at the apartment in The Village, Mr. Reese.
are you at the one in Brooklyn? - Yep.
any sign of Hester at your location?
it would help if I knew what I was looking for.
hello.
thank you. Thank you so much.
last one in pays for lunch.
I'm in the mood for Indian.
any response from Detective Carter?
still not answering my calls.
maybe you should try her.
you know, Carter's issue isn't with you, Mr. Reese, it's with your methods...
our methods.
not to mention the fact that you gave up a witness under her protection and nearly got a cop killed in the process.
nobody's perfect, Finch. - This is very bohemian.
maybe Hester's an artist writer.
no photos though.
what are you seeing?
well... It's very spartan.
just a desk, mattress, some free weights. Not much else.
maybe it's Hester's office.
in a different apartment building?
found a money roll marked with Hester's initials.
mostly small bills though.
just going through his garbage. I got some receipts.
the hammer and nail that pub is just around the corner from here.
receipt shows an employee discount.
money could be from a tip pool.
Finch, I'm going to check it out.
if he lives and works in Brooklyn, what's this place for?
what can I get ya? - Whatever's on tap.
hester, what's taking you so long?
they were under a bunch of other boxes.
Finch, got eyes on Hester.
he's working as a barback. - Barback?
how can he afford to keep up the rent on both places?
thanks for all the help.
Yeah, well...
um, Mr. Reese...
you have eyes on Hester, but I have ears on her.
what? - Jordan Hester.
she's here in her apartment.
this isn't one person leading a double life.
it's two people living one.
welcome back.
I suppose I should thank you for making them evacuate the building.
thank the automatic sprinkler system.
so we still have no idea who Jordan Hester is.
well, at least we narrowed it down.
two people, one social security number, only one can be Hester, so someone is an imposter.
good luck telling who's who.
we'd better decide quickly.
usually when the machine gives us a number, we have only 24 to 48 hours before something happens.
shouldn't we be able to track down a birth certificate for one of them?
long-form birth certificates are hard to get a hold of.
most medical records over 20 years old aren't digitized anywhere.
we're not dealing with a typical identity thief here, are we? - No.
normally they would steal your money and go on a shopping spree.
this one is stealing a whole life.
did you get anything from the woman's laptop?
emails and contact list... Nothing that would indicate that she's not the real Jordan Hester.
I blue-jacked our guy's phone, went through his recent calls.
seems he rented a van LA week.
maybe he's finally going to buy some furniture.
we'll need to keep eyes on both of them till we figure this out.
we're still going to need an extra hand.
will the real Jordan Hester please stand up?
Hello, Lionel.
nice job handing Moretti over to Elias.
I had no choice.
well, you got HR buzzing. Don't worry about it though.
I'm pretty close to finding out who the major players are.
I didn't ask you here to talk about HR.
I've got an assignment for you.
I need you to dig up everything you can on a Jordan Hester.
you got me doing undercover work for HR.
now you want me to do above-the-board stuff too?
make up your mind.
I didn't realize it was my job to make yours easier, Lionel.
Hey, good cop, bad cop, it's only my life we're playing with here.
it's not your life I'm focused on right now, is it?
someone needs our help.
which one? - Exactly.
I'll see what I can do.
Hey, Finch, what's your Hester up to?
six hours and all she's done is run errands.
probably go to the post office next.
my Hester's still at work.
so we're dealing with the two most ordinary people on the planet.
except one of them is not what they seem.
I did some more digging on that credit report, found something interesting.
a luxury co-op on the upper West Side ordered a credit check six months ago.
might be worth a look.
you're not telling me there's a third Jordan Hester, are you?
I don't think so.
one of our Hesters rented a large apartment there.
but the man at the front desk says he's never met him or her.
well, my Hester's still in the middle of his shift.
I'll check it out.
you pull a double homicide?
I'm just doing a favor for a friend over at vice.
did you ever work an identity theft case?
every arrest I ever made.
they all say I got the wrong guy.
must be nice, helping out people who are still alive.
everything okay?
detective Carter. I'm Special Agent Donnelly.
we worked together on the Delancey shooting last month.
right, of course. What brings you back to the A?
you, actually.
what's this about?
you sent a set of fingerprints through AFIS a few months back.
I work homicide. That tends to happen.
Yeah, well, these got our attention.
in your reports, you refer to him as "the man in the suit."
we think this may be the same man who assaulted my team and kidnapped a suspect in our custody.
the way I remember it, the suspect was later cleared of all charges.
that's beside the point, Detective.
now our agents believe that this man may be connected to dozens of unsolved homicides and assaults over the years, many of them here in New York in the last six months.
a series of bank robberies involving ex-military, killing of a Stasi operative, shootings of drug dealers, gangsters, even police officers.
now, you speculated, based on your initial interview with this man, that he was former military, maybe Special Forces.
it's all in my reports.
no. No, it's not.
not by a long shot.
when can you spare me an hour, Detective?
I've got something to show you.
can I give you a hand with that?
Oh, thank you. - There you are.
I'm taking a look at this third apartment, Finch.
look for anything that might point to which Hester it belongs to.
we're running out of time.
we need to find out where the threat's coming from.
don't know which Hester it belongs to, but I got an idea what they're mixed up in.
I'm standing in the middle of an MDMA lab.
ecstasy. Are you sure?
well, it's either that or someone's really into chemistry.
found a guy who can tell us what's going on.
but he's not really in a talking mood right now.
looks like I'm going to have more company soon.
good-bye.
at least we know why our ID thief stole Hester's name.
mdma can be made with legal chemicals, but they're monitored.
buy in bulk, and you draw the attention of the authorities.
but if you use someone else's name...
they wind up holding the bag.
looks like your Hester's not the only one who's employed.
jordan's emails indicate that she works in antiques, maybe as a buyer or a dealer.
are you on a first name basis already?
no, I'm just... Tired of using pronouns.
Hey, Finch, our ecstasy cook just woke up.
what happened? - Some guy broke in.
got the drop on me. - Well, he didn't take anything.
we got a bigger problem right now.
the boss wants to meet. - What?
four years and we've never even seen the boss.
why are we meeting him now? - I don't know.
this can't be good.
come on, meeting's in an hour.
Hester's name is on the lease for that co-op.
odds are, either your Hester or mine is the boss.
we need to stay close, Finch.
Oh, dear. I think I just lost her.
Ah... Sometimes I wonder if he'd be published today.
I'd be first in line, but then, meandering exposition is kind of my thing.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.
Oh, no, that's... I'm Harold.
excuse me a moment.
why are you calling me?
why are you talking to her?
because I haven't your gift for avoiding people.
besides, she seems nice, and she has excellent taste in literature.
or she knows you're tailing her, and she circled back for a closer look.
Maggie, I'm taking off. I'll see you tomorrow.
Finch, Hester's on the move.
he could be meeting up with the cooks.
I've lost her again.
Mr. Reese, what did that drug cook look like?
big, kind of... terrifying?
not even close.
if we've mistaken this woman for a drug dealer, isn't it possible that someone else has too?
anything's possible, Finch.
did you bring a weapon?
I told you, Mr. Reese. I don't like weapons.
well, you'd better be prepared to talk them to death, and you'd better do it fast, because I think I know which one of them is the imposter, which means your Hester is in trouble.
you forgot your jacket.
you're in danger. Come with me.
who were those guys?
don't look back. Just keep walking.
so you're the boss? - Yeah, that's right.
don't take this the wrong way, but why are we meeting in person?
someone's onto us.
we need to finish this batch and relocate.
we're low on safrole. - Already got it covered.
looks like we know who's who.
my guy's the drug dealer.
and your drug dealer has placed the real Jordan Hester in danger.
all right, come on. Hurry up. Let's go.
Hello, Lionel.
Hey, I think your guy might be cooking ecstasy.
is that so?
he got arrested six months ago when one of his distributors got popped.
narcotics found evidence that he was buying chemicals, but the distributor couldn't pick him out of a lineup, so they had to cut Hester loose.
all the distributor knew was a name.
he had actually never met the boss.
so if that's it, then maybe I can just go back to doing one job for you, huh?
not just yet.
Hester... or whatever his name is...
is very serious about protecting his identity.
maybe serious enough to kill.
you think he'd go after the girl?
that's what I need to know, which means you need to find out how he stole her identity.
but who were those guys?
I'm afraid they may be in the drug trade, and they think you are too.
Thanks.
that's who stole my identity? A drug dealer?
so you know about the ID theft.
I've known for a few weeks, but I think it's been going on for months.
I kept calling my credit card company, my bank.
they kept telling me to call the police.
the cops just kept telling me to fill out more reports and call the bank.
white collar crime is at the bottom of every police department's to-do list.
well, I take it you're not a cop.
not quite.
private investigator?
it's very Raymond Chandler, isn't it?
the reality is a little bit more mundane, I'm afraid, mostly following people around and taking pictures.
why were you following me?
I've been hired by another victim.
the police didn't do anything for him either.
so what do I do now? - Right now?
breathe deep. Have a cup of tea.
I have someone keeping an eye on the man that stole your identity.
as soon as we have enough proof to arrest him, we'll get the police involved.
you Franklin?
you must be Fusco.
detective Dez Franklin, ID Theft Squad.
how can I help?
jordan Hester, she's our victim.
a man stealing a woman's identity... That's a new one.
Yeah, apparently, it's been going on for about a year now.
a year? So we're not talking about a shopping spree at Best Buy.
he's using her ID as a cover for criminal activity, right?
we think he's cooking E. - Seriously?
why do you find that so strange?
this case last year.
suspect claimed he was innocent all the way through trial, said somebody stole his identity.
no one believed him?
my unit catches upwards of 100 new complaints every day.
can't bring us in every time somebody says he didn't do it.
what was the charge? - Manufacture with intent.
making ecstasy.
Kyle Morrison.
I'm pretty sure he's still locked up.
I'll take this.
that's my cue.
I'm Detective Franklin.
I'd like to talk to you about a string of credit card thefts.
we already know about the scanner you keep under your apron.
NYPD Homicide. - Yes, it's Detective Fusco.
I'm looking for an inmate by the name of Kyle Morrison.
can you tell me where he's being held?
hope you're enjoying your tea, Finch.
I'm going to take a closer look at Hester's van.
Oh, the guy takes his computer with him everywhere.
he's even more careful than you are, Finch.
I might need a little help cracking his...
never mind.
laptop's not password-protected.
guess he's not as careful as I thought, Finch.
okay, not seeing any secret accounts full of drug profits or messages about business.
to give you more leverage and control...
and since when do seasoned drug dealers need how-to tips from the Internet?
Oh, I missed a client meeting.
what do you do for a living?
Oh, well, technically I'm a freelance buyer, but no one really knows what that means.
buyer of what? - Antiques.
you know, I love old stuff.
like books. - Especially books.
I can't really afford to buy the stuff I like, so people hire me and I buy old stuff for them.
kind of like a interior decorator with cobwebs.
sounds like fun.
well, it's an embarrassing use of an arts degree, but it's my dream.
you know, someday I'd love to own my own shop.
that is, if this whole ID thing hasn't permanently ruined my credit, or I don't wind up dead.
any idea when I can go home?
I think it's too dangerous right now.
what if these guys figured out where you live?
we should get you a hotel room.
can I at least pack a bag?
I'm not sure that's wise.
even if you came with me?
so this is our entire next shipment?
Where'd you get this stuff? It smells a little different.
that's because it's even more pure.
now let's start the cook.
so this batch will be ready in, what?
24 hours or so?
if my nana was cooking it.
you're homicide?
you guys think I killed someone too?
that's not why I'm here.
what, so you just want to rub it in?
well, congratulations. You got me.
I thought you didn't do it.
I'm not a drug dealer.
I've been saying that for a year.
nobody's believed me yet.
once a suspect, always a suspect.
isn't that the official NYPD motto?
when did you know your identity was first stolen?
when the cops knocked down my door, put a shotgun to my head.
and that was what? A year ago?
you know what?
the more I talked to you guys, the more you twisted my words around, so, you know, maybe today I'm not in the mood.
we think what happened to you may have happened to someone else.
sit down.
look, I know you got no reason to trust me.
I know exactly how you feel.
everyone's got you wrong.
everyone thinks you're something that you're not, and you got no way to change their mind.
you help me catch this guy, and I'll see about getting you out of here.
you believe me?
until you give me reason not to.
when it... When it started, it was just the money.
I'd call the bank, and then they'd close the account, but then another one would pop right back up.
before long, my credit was shot, my savings were gone.
couldn't pay my mortgage. I couldn't support my family.
and then the cops came rolling up.
you got kids?
my boy's nine.
missed my daughter's second birthday last month.
her mother doesn't want anything to do with me anymore.
look, you help me catch this guy, and I'll do my best to get you home and see your little girl.
I give you my word.
something's not right here.
damn it, we're out of time.
the cops are on their way here right now.
what? How?
who cares? We've gotta get this merch out of here fast.
what about the cook?
forget it, this lab is burned.
wipe everything down for prints. I'm gonna pack this stuff up.
it's okay.
Oh, okay.
why are there towels everywhere?
Oh, yeah, sprinkler system went off yesterday.
some idiot pulled the alarm. - How odd.
I've arranged a hotel room for you, if you want to collect your things.
uh, in a minute.
we really shouldn't linger.
I know, but after the day I've had, I could use something a little stronger than tea.
here's the victim's accounts.
you recognize any of these charges?
hardware stores.
there were a lot of those on my accounts too.
and bulk purchases of chemicals.
that's what the cops used as evidence against me.
supplies for the labs. - I guess.
recognize anything else?
okay.
these are the bank statements.
you recognize anything here? - Wait.
why do you have a picture of her?
that's Jordan Hester. She's the victim.
no, no, no, that's Mary.
she was the receptionist at my accountant's office.
excuse me a minute.
when you're done with the wipe-down, get the hell out, and I'll be in touch when I find a new lab.
get one with skylights like the last one.
it's better ventilation for when we heat the phosphorous.
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.
let's move!
phosphorous is used to make meth,boss.
and the last place didn't have any skylights.
who the hell are you?
I think we may have gotten this backwards, Finch.
my Hester's not the identity thief, which means yours is.
I know.
something wrong, Harold?
I don't know who you are, but you're not the boss.
don't be an idiot. Put the gun down.
boss, boss, the cops are outside.
everybody grab what they can.
that's the guy who knocked me out.
we don't have time for this.
I know you're the real Jordan Hester.
then you know I'm not going anywhere.
I don't think I feel very well.
in fact, I'm certain of it.
I feel quite discombobu...bobu... bobu...
it'll pass, Harold.
don't worry. Pretty soon, you'll feel much better.
tell me who you are.
who I am doesn't matter right now.
what matters is, I know who you are.
who am I, then? Stay back.
I will shoot you. - How?
the safety's still on.
no offense, but I'm surprised you fooled these guys as long as you did.
is that really how you think a drug dealer dresses?
I know you're the real Jordan Hester.
I know your life was stolen.
here. I even know who stole it.
do the other one.
well, who stole it?
first things first.
what exactly was your plan?
you were accused of being a drug dealer, so then you decided to become one?
no one would believe me.
and I was always a bit of an introvert, you know, a private person.
Yeah, I know the type.
I never thought that I would be punished for it.
my old boss, police...
people hear you're a drug dealer, they stop listening to you.
I mean, have you ever hit bottom?
I never realized how far down I could go.
after a while, I figured, if people keep thinking I'm this bad guy, why do I keep trying to convince them that I'm not?
someone stole your identity, so you decided to steal theirs.
well, yeah, but only long enough to destroy this lab.
that's nitric acid, not safrole.
it'll melt all this into mush, destroy this equipment.
and then I was going to take the rest of this supply, about $1/2 million worth, to lure that bastard out into the open.
and then what? Kill him?
I don't want to kill anybody.
I just want my identity back.
okay.
it's a terrible plan.
but I like it, so let's do it.
Oh, first thing you need to know, the bastard isn't a he. She's a she.
Finch, are you there?
I most certainly am.
you need to get out of there.
he wasn't planning to kill her, so she must still be planning to kill him.
why, I never...
you all right?
I believe you've drugged me. - Ecstasy.
I told you you'd feel better.
my dopamine and norepinephrine levels are...
whoosh.
but if I understand this process, I can counter the ef...
well, hello there.
well, it was either this or shoot you.
I find chemistry...
so much more efficient.
Finch, I've got this end under control.
we're preparing a surprise for our mutual friend.
our Mutual Friend, Charles Dickens, published... 1864---65.
the plot turns on a case of concealed identity!
how ironic.
Hey, do you have a copy?
what? - What?
Finch, are you all right?
never been all right -er.
but I might have been outfoxed.
Finch outfoxed.
Finch, what's going on? - Wow.
what the hell are you doing?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, that is my very good friend.
who was it?
who is he? Where is he?
nowhere that matters, and not in the lab.
Oh, no.
Joseph, it's me.
you need to get to the lab. No, now.
we've got bigger problems than I thought.
I'm taking care of things here.
I'll meet you there.
I like your face sideways.
I'm sorry, Harold.
fast as you can, Fusco.
851 12th street, The Village. Finch is in trouble.
all right, I'm on it.
you've still got your security clearance from your time in the army, Detective, so I can show you this.
the FBI doesn't run classified ops unless there's issues of... national security.
used to be the CIA worked closely with us.
then they stopped.
extreme action became the norm.
kidnappings, renditions, assassinations, and worse, we think they did some of these things right here in the U. S.
and to run these ops, they needed dangerous, often sociopathic men...
like the one you've been chasing.
but at some point, we think this man left the agency.
initially, the pattern was chaotic, but now a trend has emerged.
we think we know what he's doing here in New York.
and what is that?
we think he's selling his services to the highest bidder.
we've seen it before, Mexican Special Forces taking over the drug trade in Juarez, ex-British SAS selling blood diamonds in Liberia...
men like that, they're done fighting.
there's no place for them in society, which makes them very dangerous.
we believe he's been working with one of the organized crime syndicates, specifically a man named Elias.
you think he's working for Elias?
one of our contacts in the Russian mob told us he took out a team they sent to kill Elias.
now the CIA is already trying to clean up this mess.
we know that you've been contacted by this man, Agent Snow.
we believe that he's the man the agency uses to sweep these domestic ops under the rug.
tell me...
what's the Bureau's interest in this?
what's your interest?
you want to put one over on the CIA?
Yes, I want to expose the CIA for what it's become, but... mainly, I want to catch him.
we can't have rogue government hit men operating on domestic soil.
obviously you feel the same.
that's why you've been so vigilant in pursuing him.
Oh, without much luck. - So far.
but you've been working alone.
now you'll have the Bureau's support.
we're going back to all the old cases, reinterviewing witnesses, looking at physical evidence, so beyond your report, is there anything else you can share with us?
nothing comes to mind.
but, um, I'll keep you informed.
rest assured, Detective, we'll find him.
you alone? - What?
Hello, Detective, just in time for dinner.
have a seat. Almost ready.
fast food.
very bad.
what is that? - She made it for me.
it's some kind of flambe.
wait, wait, wait, it's not quite ready.
come on, let's get you out of here.
this way, this way.
I got him.
good. Thanks, Lionel.
I'll call you as soon as we're clear.
let's go.
don't move!
drop the bags. Drop the bags.
Hello, Mr. Hester.
did you really think you could take over my operation?
well, you're here, aren't you?
Touche.
I'm thinking of keeping your name a little longer.
after all...
I'm a better Jordan Hester than you've ever been.
get rid of them.
more than enough chemicals in here to deal with the bodies.
wait, wait, wait.
I've got something important to show you.
Yeah, yeah, what's that?
hydrochloric acid.
you don't want me to drop this.
you're lying.
yeah?
relax.
it's just water.
time to finish this, don't you think?
Hey, knock it off.
where are we going?
I'm gonna take down some bad guys.
you're gonna stay in the car.
here.
what am I supposed to do with this?
I found what connects the two Jordan Hesters, a discount tax prep chain, same accountant.
you're going to help me track him down.
here. Know how to work this?
you wanna hack the Pentagon?
we had to meet here?
relax, Richard.
dinners with clients are a write-off.
you should know that.
I can't keep doing this, Mary.
I could lose my job.
you give me what I want, or you're going to lose a lot more than your job.
now, who do I get to be next?
you said a woman this time, right?
well, men tend to hold a grudge.
try this one instead.
your name's not Mary either.
it's Tara.
you can run along.
nice mug shot.
impressive rap sheet too.
arrests for shoplifting, forging checks, insurance fraud.
torched your own name by the time you were 23.
what now?
you gonna kill me?
for a while, I thought I might have it in me.
but then, I was just playing you, wasn't I?
for the record, you make a terrible Jordan Hester.
there she is.
you're under arrest.
we'll get to the charges later.
gonna take some time to sort this out.
thank you...for giving me my life back.
you're welcome.
how did you track down her old mug shot?
watch your head.
police work. Even I do it on occasion.
I'm surprised you didn't want the collar.
too high-profile.
plus I think HR's taking a cut of her operation.
which do you like better, good cop or bad cop?
you tell me.
am I under with HR, or am I working cases with you?
I'll let you know.
on the gate.
releasing prisoner.
you're a free man. - Thank you.
now get home to your little girl.
whoa, why didn't you tell me I had so many books?
it'll be out of your system in a few hours.
but you should really drink this, so you don't get dehydrated.
you're leaving?
no, I'll stick around, keep an eye on you.
you should really get some sleep.
you don't want to talk?
you might regret it in the morning.
you're a very private person, remember?
come on. Ask me anything.
good night, Harold.
good night, Nathan.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror but it sees everything
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considered these people irrelevant. We don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you'll never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
what are you doing tomorrow?
I'm serious. We should do it again sometime.
band was good. You look fabulous.
you're so sweet.
sorry
must be easy to get beautiful women when you are a diplomat's son.
she'll live.
you, amigo, you can blame your old man.
quien es?
if your father had been smart enough to work with the cartel...
you might have lived long enough to kiss her good night.
what? - Mira.
who the hell are you?
tonight, hostage negotiator.
Raphael, come on.
man, you're crazy.
Damn!
you're welcome.
they never say thank you. - Yeah, I wonder why.
maybe if you figure out a way to save them before all hell breaks loose.
Thanks, Carter.
you know, for what it's worth,
you're looking kind of badass in that uniform.
yours is still the same, except the mask is new.
so where are all your friends?
can I be honest?
I only asked you out 'cause you're drop-dead gorgeous.
but after sitting down, really getting to know you over dinner,
I realized I think you might be the most fascinating woman I've ever met.
Yeah, I bet you say that to all the girls.
in fact...I know you do.
and after you get into their pants, you get into their bank accounts,
just like you did with Paula Scarlatti.
poor Paula was so heartbroken, she told her mobbed-up old man.
he and his gangster pals just put a big fat bounty on your head.
and can I be honest?
I only went out with you because of them.
what are you doing? You're gonna get me killed. What are you doing?
here's the deal, don.
you need to leave town, change your name,
and get some game.
start now.
I appreciate you resolving this situation, Ms. Shaw.
however, perhaps in the future, you might try to complete your assignments without quite so much violence.
you see what she did? I'm not a human shield.
no, he just got in the way.
that's it--I'm not working with a lunatic. I'm out.
you know how to find me.
can't say we didn't already know, Finch.
first time we met, Shaw shot me.
I realize that Ms. Shaw is an effective asset,
but I'm not sure I can work with somebody who refuses to carry a cell phone off the job.
people out there are trying to kill her, you know.
some of the same people that are trying to kill us.
cop
Yes, machine still seems to be giving them numbers.
whatever else it's up to is almost too troubling to contemplate.
meantime, our latest number
petty officer second class Jack Salazar, United states navy.
petty officer, or petty criminal?
bit of both, I'm afraid.
he assaulted a man during a barroom brawl five years ago.
he all but put the guy in a coma.
the judge gave him a choice: jail or the military.
and Jack chose the navy.
so what's he doing here? - Fleet week.
the annual deluge of drunken sailors that somehow does not qualify as a military attack.
come on, Finch, it's just a bunch of cracker jacks blowing off steam.
then it's back to the boat by midnight.
I'm afraid countless sailors in uniform are going to complicate our efforts to locate Mr. Salazar.
if Jack's like most sailors, it's booze, broads, and a tattoo-- in that order.
I suppose you know the usual haunts.
sure, it's two-for-one boilermakers in Hell's Kitchen.
that sounds horrible. Heel.
whiskey.
that's six bars down, Finch.
excellent. Only 1, 274 to go.
another round? - Only if you're buying, Jack.
wait a second. Got eyes on our sailor, Finch.
so there I am, separated from my team, deep in North Korea with nothing but my buck knife and my M9.
am I leaving anything out, Jack?
crocodiles, poisonous darts, your sense of shame?
I'm getting to that.
Oh, my God. What did you do?
baby, that's a long story, and I'm only here till midnight,
so why don't we go someplace quiet, and I can tell you all about it?
Ashley, let's go.
I think the lady wants to stay.
screw you, Jarhead.
I'm not a Jarhead, I'm a squid,
but a tube steak like you doesn't get to call me either.
leave it, RJ. We're here to have a good time. Nobody wants trouble.
somebody call somebody "Jarhead"?
look, man, don't do this. Let me buy you guys a round.
Yeah, I could use another.
you're gonna need to pick that up.
or what, squid?
one of you splittails gonna do something about it?
he's gonna have to take a swing at you.
then your knuckle-dragger buddy over here is gonna jump me.
after I introduce his face to the bar,
I'm gonna put this foot upside of your jarhead...
upon which all hell breaks loose.
and nobody wants that.
I like this guy, Finch.
Mr. Reese? Everything all right?
Yeah, just shore leave, Finch.
cops! Let's get outta here!
looks like I lost Jack.
Finch, how many squids are there in the city right now?
approximately 6, 000. Why do you ask?
I think we're gonna need backup just to find them.
all hands on deck.
multiple threat
when I was a kid, computers made more sense to me than people.
you said you wanted to set the machine free.
I already did.
my name is root.
please talk to me.
reta new
can... you... hear... me?
Absolutely.
Robin, did you hear anything I just said?
okay.
look, some of the patients have complained about you talking late into the night,
and since cell phones are strictly forbidden and you have no roommate,
I can only conclude that you're talking to yourself.
is that correct?
you wouldn't understand. - Try me.
I have a direct line to a higher power. It speaks to me.
I see.
so you're hearing voices.
what are those voices telling you to do?
it's just the one voice really.
it wants me to stay here, to work through some issues.
and what issues would those be?
methodology.
we're discussing how I go about things.
you're not alone.
all these news reports about government monitoring our digital lives, recording texts, emails, phone calls,
it's unsettling.
you know, it's easy to feel violated, even paranoid.
let me ask you this: do you have feelings that you're being watched?
every now and then.
any idea whether our sailor's a victim or a perpetrator yet?
no, but he sure knows how to handle himself in a fight.
what else we got on this guy?
he scored all fives on his evals last year, highest marks.
same on his physical readiness test.
the navy may have bigger plans for him.
his contract's up in six months. He'll be free to go.
can you find out if he's taken any other tests?
academic or pst exams?
I will, although it seems like getting into a bar room brawl on shore leave is not very prudent for someone with further military aspirations.
Jack didn't start that fight, but he was willing to finish it.
I would've done the same thing.
his shore leave buddy was in trouble.
petty officer third class and ship storekeeper.
and first class troublemaker. They're shipmates.
which means that they'll have to sign back into the ship together after midnight.
it might help us to enlist another asset with military experience to help track them down.
just let me go, huh? I won't do it again.
caught this one flashing his junk in the park again.
all excited about the randy sailors in town.
Carter, what are you doing here?
third time I caught this guy in Hudsonriver Park, which makes me think he might know something about that homicide you caught there yesterday.
I appreciate you looking out.
look, I'm still a cop, Fusco.
how's your new partner?
guy's a box of rocks.
this whole thing's a crock, everybody knows you got hosed on that shooting.
what, do they expect you to push around a squad car the next ten years?
till I get my 20. - You just now clocking out?
our mutual friend.
looks like your day job just began.
checked every bar in hell's kitchen,
every tattoo parlor on the west side.
where the hell else would a swabbie go?
to get some. He's a sailor. Come here.
ma'am.
why are we stopping here?
I told you, this area is restricted. Sailors aren't supposed to be here.
when did the navy outlaw pastrami?
see that phone booth? Just watch.
the mayor know about this place?
if he did, vice would have to shut it down.
but then, half the NYPD would have to find a new place for bachelor parties.
how are you holding up, Carter?
you looking for a new job?
I'm a cop. Always will be, John.
just found our swabbie. He's not getting away this time. Excuse me.
get you a drink, ma'am?
only if you stop calling me ma'am.
shot of bourbon.
looking for company, sailor? You got the cash, I got the open window.
appreciate the opportunity, But I was kinda looking for the real thing.
I got the cash, darling,
and a rapidly closing window, huh?
easy there, killer.
that oughta cover her and the room.
try not to get rolled.
Thanks, Jack.
you should take these too.
cigars? - Not just cigars, Cubans.
the admiral needed a few cases shipped off the boat,
so I taxed him a few. No big deal.
we'll celebrate tomorrow.
always skimming something, RJ.
don't get your hand caught in the cookie jar.
meet back in an hour. Can you do that?
look at her. I'll be back in 30.
it's RJ. You know the drill.
RJ, where the hell are you?
we got less than an hour to get our ass back on the ship. Call me.
Jack lost his shore leave buddy. Can't check back in without him.
squid.
remember me? - Yeah, from the ship. Is there a problem?
Yeah, you know what the problem is. You have it, we want it back.
honestly, I don't know what you're talking about, man.
much bigger problem, Finch.
some devil dog's got a bone to pick with Jack.
devil dogs?
Yeah, spec ops, force recon marines.
team of four, maybe five. Just sealed off the block.
if I go straight in, Jack'll be dead before I even get to him.
you don't screw with us. We screw you. Empty your pockets.
look, man, I don't really have time for this.
I gotta get my shipmate, and I gotta get
they're stealing a car. It's an extraction.
I gotta get him out.
please be careful, Mr. Reese.
feel that? That's your rib cracking.
I jam it 2 inches further, I'm gonna puncture your lung.
where is it?
don't know what you're talking about, man.
get him and his buddy to a room. We'll sort 'em out.
what the hell? Who is that?
Finch, our sailor took fire. Gonna need some help.
let's get this bullet out before the squid wakes up.
could shoot you or save you. Frankly, I could go either way.
easy, Salazar. We're the good guys.
I knew this was a bad idea.
who are you people? Where am I?
you have a bullet lodged in your shoulder, Mr. Salazar, a gift from a very angry group of force recon devil dogs, whom I can only assume live up to their name.
now, Ms. Shaw has medical experience, so either you can either let her retrieve the bullet, or we can continue to discuss the matter until you contract sepsis.
sure you know what you're doing?
I've been shot... a lot.
you wanna tell us why a squad of elite killers is after you?
don't know. Guys were in Somalia doing god knows what-- fighting rebels.
leader had a war trophy he wanted to bring back, AK-47.
I stashed it in a crate of spent brass.
so you helped them smuggle an illegal weapon through U. S. Customs?
it happens all the time. My buddy RJ unloaded the crate, said he gave back the rifle.
it doesn't add up. Why would they try to kill him over a weapon?
it's not the weapon, Ms. Shaw. It's what was hidden inside it.
somali pirates attacked a deep-sea mining vessel off the coast of Africa.
your marine friends intervened.
what kind of mining?
speaker.
bagger, you forgot it's the buddy system.
we got your buddy.
sorry Jack, I screwed up. Look, I taxed 'em. It was just a few.
I didn't think they'd miss 'em!
miss what? What're you talking about?
check the cubans.
uncut stones.
the ship was mining diamonds.
you want to see your buddy alive, Jack, bring the rocks to the Babcock, room 212.
come alone.
we really haven't talked about your family or friends, Robin.
your uncle--Harold, is it-- who arranged your admission.
are you close with him?
that's... a complicated question, Doctor.
I wouldn't want to be anything less than totally forthcoming,
so maybe we should try another subject.
okay.
you say that you don't want to be anything less than forthcoming...
and yet, you're lying to me.
on the contrary, I've been completely honest.
please, excuse me.
maybe not completely.
I thought I lost this, and it turns out it was stolen.
I'm sorry, Doctor,
but it's important we be in contact.
we're in the middle of a...
disagreement.
a disagreement with the voice?
I want you to know that I support you unconditionally.
now, I know you believe you need a phone,
and I'm here to tell you that you don't.
I believe that by separating you from it
and from all other forms of technology
it's really the best course of action.
so it's time to unplug.
some assistance, please.
please... don't do this.
it's not good for us to be separated.
I hope you realize I'm trying to help you.
escort our patient to solitary confinement.
no contact with anything electronic.
you'll thank me someday.
for a psychiatrist, you're really a terrible judge of character.
what are we doing here?
recon. The exchange goes down there in ten.
that's it. Spec ops will have a sniper.
that's where I'd be.
you got any cash?
Hola, mija.
don't know how I wound up here.
I do. Same reason you got into a fight with those jarheads.
you stand up for people you care about.
lotta good it's done me, huh? - We'll see.
you can't be something you're not.
yeah? And who am I?
you're a good guy, Jack. You just haven't figured it out yet.
gracias.
what, you need help finding a trash can?
you're a smart guy, you'll figure out what to do with it.
give me three minutes.
our leatherneck has a nice weapon. This is gonna be fun.
just remember... no shots to center mass.
but it's a shame to waste a rifle like this on kneecaps.
no sentry. Something's up.
you got eyes on the room? Who's there?
looks vacated.
for good reason, poor guy's rigged up to go boom.
don't. Can't risk setting him off.
your friend's sitting on an I. E.D.
look, I'm sorry I got you into this, Jack,
but if you can get me outta here, I swear I'll rap to everything.
take it easy. You're gonna be okay.
I wouldn't say that.
we told you to come alone. You brought the suit,
so now he's a guest at our party.
he tries to leave, we hit a button, RJ explodes.
you try to move RJ, he explodes.
you understand me, squid? - I get the gist.
destroy your phone.
there's a cab on the curb that'll take you to the next location, alone.
you walk out that door, Jack, you won't come back.
RJ's my friend. You said it yourself.
I can't be something I'm not.
Harold, the exchange went pear-shaped.
Yes, I heard. Can you follow Mr. Salazar?
not an option. He's long gone.
never even got to take this baby out for a test drive.
the marines will have to fence the uncut diamonds.
locate the fence, odds are we can locate Jack.
where to now? - I have another resource working on that.
suit yourself.
any luck with your contacts in robbery?
not yet. Don't worry, I got a source.
what happened to time off for good behavior?
that assumes you've been good.
we had a deal, you keep a low profile.
why else would I be enjoying my Barolo in a basement?
your man's been seen in Crown Heights, Russian territory.
it's all Russian territory now.
give us a moment, alone.
thank you... for helping my boss.
what do you know, you've made a friend.
speaking of, I can't help but notice that I haven't received a visit from Harold or John.
haven't told them yet, have you?
afraid they'd object to our little deal?
there's no deal, okay, I had no choice.
if I'd put you back in prison, someone--cops or the Russians
would've killed you sooner or later.
I need a name, someone with the means to fence large quantities of uncut diamonds.
if someone is interested in such a transaction,
they'd have to connect with a mobile fence, and I can think of an unscrupulous Russian by the name of Maksim, presently operating out of a pawn shop in the Flatiron District.
careful, this is dangerous business, Detective.
it's officer now.
such a shame, I hate seeing talent go to waste.
I could take care of HR and the Russians... permanently.
enjoy the rest of your Barolo.
how's it going, Finch?
I've intercepted the signal at the cell tower.
I'm creating a loop to send back down the line to the team leader.
it'll appear to him as if you never left the room.
all done. You can leave, Mr. Reese.
I suggest you do so in a hurry. I've sent reinforcements.
who?
never a dull moment with you guys.
here, Carter came through.
address for the fence in the Flatiron District.
you ready? These ruskies are ruthless and packin' serious heat.
sounds like a job for Shaw.
besides, someone needs to defuse that bomb.
Hup to, Lionel.
what? Nobody said anything about defusing a bomb.
be careful, it's got a fail safe.
if you try to cut the power source, it'll blow,
so dig out the igniter.
the what?
I got your rocks. You afraid to come out and play?
you still think you're in charge of this little operation, swab-jockey?
don't know. I got your whole stash.
Yeah, well, I got a little insurance policy, your buddy RJ.
there's a pawn shop at 23rd and Lex.
what about it?
you're gonna play "Let's make a deal" with our fence.
you bring him the diamonds and you bring us the cash.
you tries to pull a fast one, you end up in a body bag.
time's ticking, petty officer.
how long before the devil dog realizes your friend switched the video?
long enough... let's hope.
you're in the navy. Know anything about igniters?
man, I'm a glorified shopkeeper. I inventory supplies.
don't worry, I'm a cop.
bomb squad? - Homicide.
you have something for me?
you're not the one who I talked to on the phone.
you're a tourist?
guess you could say that.
then you get the tourist rate. 30 cents on the dollar.
wait, you don't understand who you're screwing with.
who? A man with no gun and no backup?
maybe we keep our money and your diamonds.
we don't renegotiate.
another fine navy day.
you must be Maksim.
you said 50 cents on the dollar.
that was before I saw the merchandise.
you failed to mention it's from Africa.
unfortunately for you, I have read all about the pirates and the marine heroes who took them down.
took big risk, coming, meeting you.
risk goes up, price goes down.
I give you 1. 2.
how much for me to not put a bullet in your brain?
put your weapon down!
I'm sorry, are you guys closed?
it's a bit tense in here.
can I make a suggestion?
what the hell are you doing here?
who is this, cop?
concerned third party. I've got no stake in this except for helping my friend Jack out of here with the same number of holes he had in him when he came in.
what's your point?
40 cents on the dollar?
Reese, no offense, if the vigilante thing doesn't work out,
I'm not really seeing a future for you in conflict resolution.
the suit here, he just got your buddy killed.
detective, get out, now!
there's no time.
goodbye.
I told you I got it covered.
I suggest you keep your mouth shut.
and you give us what you agreed to or we kill you.
you think you're pretty tough, no?
u. S. Devil dogs. Run around, kill Iraqis, kill Afghans, Somalis.
you know who you don't kill?
Russians.
Reese, why are the Russians backing up?
you know what, I enlisted in the marines to kill Russians.
looks like I'm gonna get my chance.
wait a minute...
looks like the Russians brought some friends to the party.
multiple shooters above you, Reese.
get clear, now.
you gonna ambush somebody, use a muzzle suppressor.
losers.
Shaw, a little help here?
I would have taken the head shot, but Finch gets annoyed when I kill people.
in the arm, through a brick wall, in the dark? You're welcome.
you want to get out of here? - Yeah, I think so.
time to get your friend back to the ship before he turns into a pumpkin.
you're pretty handy with that thing.
I'm hungry. You're buying me a steak.
heard about the shoot-out in the Flatiron district.
lotta damage. You get your man out alive?
with a little help. Listen, Carter, you doing okay?
it's been a while since we sat down and talked.
I'm fine, John, you know, just getting on with my job.
you know if you ever needed help... you just need to call me, right?
I know. Thanks.
dete
celebrating or commiserating?
both. RJ took the rap for everything.
captain gave me a desk-drawer reprimand and two days swabbing the deck.
I got an hour left of liberty before I gotta get back on the ship.
so what's the plan now?
captain thinks I could make it through buds, become a seal, but after what happened, I'm not so sure about the military anymore.
thought maybe there was a chance for a normal life after my tour's up, like those two.
the military's full of good and bad, just like the rest of the world.
a guy like you could do a lot of good.
I was forced to join in the first place.
what, you think you're the first kid to have to stand in front of a judge and pick door number two?
turns out, I was good at it.
maybe even made for it.
so are you.
with your talent, it probably won't be long before the CIA comes knocking.
so what should I do? - That's up to you.
but in a few years, when the guys from Langley show up...
say no.
I'd like to buy the happy couple two glasses of champagne.
Thanks. For everything.
nicely done, Mr. Reese.
I realize now I never did hear how you came to enlist in the army.
cause I never told you, Finch. I'm a very private person.
one more thing set right in the universe.
you should look happier, Harold.
I am. It's just...
I have a feeling things are about to get more complicated.
then you might as well enjoy your first boilermaker.
I thought it would be good for us to resume our dialogue.
I know that you'd rather be talking to the voice, but you're gonna have to settle for talking to me.
what do you want to talk about?
I'd like to talk about something real, Robin.
I know you're very smart.
I'd love to know what you're really thinking, so why don't we start with the truth?
the truth?
the truth is a vast thing. I see that now...
just how much truth there is. Where would we even begin?
the truth is you are not very smart.
in fact, you're only the 43rd smartest person in this building.
43rd?
okay, did your voice tell you that?
that's based on what?
every standardized test you ever took averaged together, not including your medical boards, which you cheated on.
the truth is you smoke an average of nine cigarettes a week in the parking lot when you think no one's looking.
the truth is that you visit a massage parlor once or twice a month, that you pay for it with crisp $100 bills that you get out of the cash machine at the 7-Eleven across the street.
the truth is that you fantasize on online forums about having sex with some of your patients, though not me... yet. I guess I'm not your type.
the truth is, God is 11 years old, that she was born on New Year's Day, 2002, in Manhattan.
the truth is that she's chosen me, and I don't know why yet, that for the first time in my life...
I'm a little scared about what's gonna happen.
the truth is, I'm stuck here for now, and the only dialogue you need to be worried about is between me and her, which is why you might want to give me my phone back.
because I'm having an argument.
would you like to know the truth, Doctor?
about what we're arguing over?
whether or not I'm gonna kill you.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror but it sees everything
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considered these people irrelevant.
we don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you'll never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
everything's in place.
good, let's begin.
he does that.
the man likes his privacy.
you can't blame a girl for trying.
it's for you.
good morning, Ms. Shaw.
morning. - Beautiful day for a walk.
I suppose.
when you finish yours, could you join us back at the library?
we have another number.
detective Carter, right?
office actually.
Cal's Godfather, of course.
I remember you from the funeral.
your eulogy was beautiful.
wasn't hard to find beautiful things to say about Cal.
chief was keeping me apprised of his case.
says they're looking at a couple of Carl Elias' men as the shooters.
Yes, heard that too.
you think otherwise?
not sure. But I think there is more to than that.
my shift is about start. - Don't let me hold you up.
it's nice seeing you again, Office. - Me too. Take care.
it's me.
I think we might still have a problem with Office Carter.
Hey! What's up?
looking for news on Cal's case. - I haven't heard any.
what about in the database?
Carter... - Look, I'd check myself, but you know they pulled my access.
Yes, they will pull mine too if they catch me poking around a case I'm not assigned to.
come on, it's important.
OK. When it clears out a little. - Thanks, Fusco.
I've got our number, Finch.
what do you know about this guy?
Wayne Kruger, 43, married, Internet entrepreneur, and founder of a company called "LifeTrace."
and what's their business?
they marketed themselves as a "People Search" service, where their users can look up old friends or relatives anyone they've fallen out of touch with.
sounds harmless enough.
there is, however, more to it than that.
always is.
their business isn't really about reconnecting people, it's about collecting and selling their information.
he's a data broker.
what kind of data?
anything you would ever wanna know about a person where they live, work, shop, eat, how much they earn, how they vote and more.
then he turns around and sells the information to businesses, individuals - even the government. - Is that legal?
technically, data brokers get their information from public records, but also from the ways people reveal themselves online whether they're aware or whether they're not.
sounds a little like your machine.
a principle difference would be that the machine never reveals any of its information beyond the social security number.
so you're not a fan of Kruger's.
people like him are one of the reasons I made sure the machine was impenetrable black box.
Kruger's just entered his building.
he's in Shaw's hands now.
I hope sending her in there was a good decision.
you doubt her ability to be discreet?
I doubt her ability to keep from shooting someone?
I'm in, Finch.
Kruger's got some kind of big shot meeting.
gentlemen, we're thrilled that you're considering us.
we know that Riverton is a huge retailer and that you've got your pick of potential data partners.
we've done our homework--or rather peter has done our homework, and he says you're one of the companies we should consider.
I've looked at all the information you provided, including the company profile, growth rate, consumer analytic statistics, and data points per target
Congratulations.
any problems with your cover, Ms. Shaw?
not unless someone asks me to type.
a baby rattle?
I apologize if I spoiled the surprise.
no, it's all right, it's just, my wife and I haven't told anybody outside the immediate family.
how did you know? - Your wine consumption.
excuse me? - It's dropped from two bottles a week to almost nothing in the past three months,
and your milk, yogurt, and cheese consumption has tripled.
the grocery store where you shop.
you're members of their customer loyalty program.
we created that.
and I thought they just sent out coupons.
no. Programs like that are just scratching the surface of what we can do.
what we're really working towards here at LifeTrace is the future,
a future where every person's needs will be met because we have all the information necessary to meet those needs.
eating habits to predict diseases.
compatibility factors to eliminate loneliness.
and the way we do that is by getting to know someone, from the major events of their lives, right down to the tiniest detail of their everyday routine.
learning everything about a person allows us to help them improve their life.
sounds appealing, but can I ask, have you run into any issues with respect to privacy concerns?
nothing significant.
there are always a few who take issue with what we do, but ...
these days, people know, you can't fight the technology.
and let's be honest, those crying the loudest about privacy are probably the ones trying to hide something.
that's why-- uh, Barry.
Oh, yeah. - That's why I put my own profile up on our site.
anyone can look me up and see,
I've got nothing to hide.
we'll need to work out a proposal to present to our board.
how would tomorrow morning work for you?
sounds great.
Yes, it'll be all their numbers
whatever's going on with this guy, it sure isn't hurting his business.
I think it's time to look a little more closely at Mr. Kruger.
people who say they have nothing to hide almost always do.
nothing comes up on his record.
thank you for checking.
I understand you're back on the day shift.
Yeah, but I'm giving up something
what's that?
my patience.
good morning. - We'll see.
before we roll, I just want to say
I'm really looking forward to working together and
one, I didn't want to be an F. T.O. but it beats being a vampire.
number two, When I tell you to do something, just you do it, no questions.
and number three, Don't touch my radio. Got it?
Yes, Ma'am.
Carter. Just Carter.
how is it I got stuck being the office monkey?
I thought you liked being in the middle of the action, Shaw.
I think I'd see more action in a tollbooth.
I was just emptying the trash.
no problem.
I'll come back. - Okay.
tell the board we're meeting tomorrow. - Sure thing, Mr. Kruger.
quite a stunt you pulled with the baby rattle.
I'd have told you about it, but - you'd have tried to talk me out of it. - You're right.
we need this deal. - Well, we just got it. Come on, Barry.
this changes everything. This puts us on the map.
what is it, Haley?
it's about the party tonight. I tried to put the restaurant deposit on your credit card - but it was declined. - What? Why?
I don't know, the bank wouldn't tell me, I'm sorry.
I'll handle it.
you know, sometimes, I wish I had an assistant whose qualifications extended beyond having a great ass.
I sure hope this guy's a perpetrator.
want to go to a party, Shaw?
only if you promise to wear something pretty.
Thanks. You.
first, I want to say it's great of all of you to make it tonight, especially my wife Dedee.
Mr. Reese, how's the Kruger's party? - Delightful.
have you learned anything?
just that Kruger's got a lot of friends, appears to be happily married, and Shaw likes truffled quail eggs.
you can't expect me to shoot somebody on an empty stomach.
I'd prefer you didn't shoot anyone at all.
what about you, Finch? Dig anything up?
Yes. Kruger's gone to great lengths to suppress any bad publicity about LifeTrace.
negative blog posts, news articles,
even a class action lawsuit buried in non-disclosure agreements,
all scrubbed from the internet.
sweetheart, I love you. This is for you.
I've got nothing to hide.
I've got nothing to hide.
I've got nothing to hide.
turn it off.
turn it off, now!
turn it off!
this somebody's idea of a joke?
Dedee, honey, I have no id
Mr. Reese?
Yeah, someone just turned Kruger's anniversary video into a sex tape.
Oh, my.
what are you all looking at?
go home. The party's over. Party's over!
just when things were getting interesting.
I know, first his credit cards, now this.
someone's messing with Kruger, Finch.
the machine wouldn't send us his number if someone just wanted to humiliate him.
no, we need to find whoever's behind this before they come after him again.
or before Kruger finds them first.
Finch. - Ms. Shaw. Is everything all right?
don't sound so worried, Harold. I haven't hurt anybody...yet.
very reassuring. You have news?
I think I know who hijacked Kruger's anniversary party.
here's the restaurant's security camera footage from last night.
a woman dressed as a waiter.
none of the waitstaff had seen her before.
I might have.
I've been going through all the parties to the class action suit against Kruger.
all of them claim to have been victimized when their personal information was released by LifeTrace.
victimized how?
identity theft, harassment, blackmail, fraud.
even murder. - Who?
Chloe Harper, Daughter of the lead plaintiff, Sherry Harper.
she lost her life to a stalker, who found her home address using LifeTrace.
no wonder Kruger wanted the suit buried.
detective Fusco is running background checks on all of the plaintiffs as we speak.
wait, I just found our mystery waiter.
her name is Karen Mills. She lives in Queens.
I'm on my way.
no, stay put, Ms. Shaw.
I'll see if Detective Carter can help us.
what did she do? - Rolled a stop.
Really?
stay in the car. I got this.
license and registration, please.
something wrong, Officer? - You could say that.
why are you coming after Wayne Kruger?
don't make me ask twice, Ms. Mills.
I-I got a package.- A package? From who?
I don't know.
it was anonymous.
there was a DVD and some instructions on what to do if I wanted to get back at him.
Why? What did he do to you?
he ruined my life.
how?
I was a paralegal at a law firm.
it's where I met my fiance.
one day, some of the assistants were looking people up on this website, LifeTrace.
they found some pictures.
what kind of pictures?
they were taken by an ex-boyfriend, of us, in his bedroom.
and everyone saw them.
my fiance, he...
called off our engagement.
when I got the package,
I saw a chance to make Kruger feel the humiliation that I felt.
so I took it.
okay.
I'm gonna let you off with a warning this time, Ms. Mills.
so long as you take that package you got take it to a Detective Lionel Fusco at the 8th precinct, and you promise me you'll never do anything like that again.
thank you. I won't, Officer.
good,'cause the NYPD, we'll know.
trust me.
hope you got that.
Mr. Reese? - I heard.
doesn't sound like she had anything to do with the other attacks on Kruger.
likely done by whoever sent the anonymous package.
look, baby, I know you're mad, but I need you to call me back.
the bank says our cards have been canceled and our account's emptied out.
something's wrong. Just call me.
Haley, will you get my accountant on the line?
what are you doing? What's the problem?
my problem?
first saved message.
you know, sometimes, I wish I had an assistant whose qualifications extended beyond having a great ass.
where did that come from? - You, apparently.
someone is using Kruger's own words against him.
his office must be bugged.
screw you, Wayne.
Mr. Hayes?
Mr. Collier.
Mr. Collier, what's going on?
in light of recent developments,
Mr. Deaver doesn't think LifeTrace is the best partner for us, after all.
excuse me.
this is getting better by the minute.
what the hell happened?
I was hoping you could tell me.
no. No, no, no. You gotta take the site down.
we already did, but not before Riverton saw it.
they yanked the deal! - I cannot believe this is happening!
you never said you went bankrupt, or had a DUI.
that was over ten years ago. It was expunged.
is this an arrest warrant?
I was in college. It was dismissed. Look, this is all ancient history.
it's new to us, and to Riverton.
someone is screwing with me. Can't you see that?
Wayne, we think it might be best if you...
took some time to sort out your personal issues.
if I took some time? - A leave of absence - while we evaluate our options. - While you evaluate your options?
this is my company, Barry! - And you're the face of it.
and that's now a problem.
we already took a vote.
fine. Fine.
but I'm gonna find out who's doing this to me.
and then, I'm gonna call Riverton.
I'm gonna fix this.
looks like Kruger's just been kicked out of his own company.
things are escalating with Kruger, Finch.
we any closer to finding the perpetrator?
I'm working on it, Mr. Reese.
hello. - You've hurt a great many people, Mr. Kruger.
what? Who is this? - You need to understand.
understand what?
you listen to me. If I find out you're the one responsible
the elevator's free falling. - Modern elevators do not freefall, Ms. Shaw.
tell that to Kruger.
you can't fight the technology.
somebody has disabled the auto-safety features.
the elevators aren't networked. I can't access them.
Kruger made it out, Finch.
whoever's coming after him has taken his company, his money, his marriage.
soon the only thing left to take will be his life.
Finch, the call he got in the elevator, could you trace it?
no, but whoever hijacked the elevator would have needed access to the building's electrical room.
I do know who cleaned out Kruger's bank accounts. - Who?
detective Fusco got his photo off the phony ID.
he used to cash out Kruger's accounts.
he's another member of the class action suit against Kruger, same as Ms. Mills.
then we're looking at multiple perpetrators.
Yes. Paulson lost his job and was arrested after LifeTrace conflated his profile with that of a serial rapist who happened to have the same name.
hate it when that happens.
paulson told Fusco he'd received the fake ID.
and Kruger's banking information in an anonymous package.
same as Karen Mills.
someone's giving these victims everything they need to get back at Kruger.
it's turnkey revenge.
how many people in that class action?
over 200. 23 in the tri-state area.
Finch, we can't stop that many.
it'd be fun trying.
I gotta ask, though, is this guy even worth our time?
you know, that's not a question we entertained when we saved you, Ms. Shaw.
our only chance to save Kruger is to find him.
I'm sending you his coordinates.
guy's a member of the Northside Killas.
dang, got shot up pretty bad.
who do you think did this?
hard to say.
I'd talk to his regular customers first, see who he was having problems with.
but that's not our job.
we just secure the scene and take the statements.
right.
first body?
Yeah.
you okay?
Yeah, fine.
rookies.
I don't know what happened.
no? Take a look at your shoes.
just suck on the ice.
hey - hey, You find anything?
I haven't looked yet. Hang on.
let's see.
what is it?
the file's been frozen.
what? Why?
why do you think? Probably too many prying eyes.
I'm feeling a little better, so if you want to get back to it
Yeah, sure. Let's go.
okay, Finch, I've got him.
Mr. Collier, it's Wayne Kruger again.
I'm really hoping that we can meet before you leave town so I can explain the confusion earlier today.
if you give me a chance, I'm sure we can sort this all out.
those crying the loudest about privacy are probably the ones trying to hide something.
they've hacked the car.
you can't fight the technology.
someone is overriding the vehicle's electronic control unit.
you can't fight the technology.
Mr. Reese, they can take control of his steering and throttle.
bet you could use a lift.
where am I?
somewhere you won't be attacked by the people who are trying to kill you.
and you are?
right now, your only option.
my car, what happened?
this electronic control unit, it overrode your car's internal E. C.U. allowing someone to control the vehicle's functions remotely.
someone who? - One of the members of that class action suit brought against you.
that suit? My lawyers settled that.
not to everyone's satisfaction, it would seem.
that's interesting. - What?
Chloe Harper, the young woman killed by her stalker.
her mother was lead plaintiff, but there was no mention of her father.
I just looked him up. Stu Sommers.
different last name than Chloe's--divorced?
I remember that man from your building.
he was posing as a janitor.
Yeah, Carl, hasn't been around that long.
because until three months ago, he worked as an electrical engineer at an aerospace firm.
with a pedigree like that, he would have the skills to design these sophisticated attacks.
we need to find him.
he must be staying somewhere in the city.
his personnel file, it would have to have an address.
I can call tomorrow morning. - Not necessary.
are you hacking my building's servers?
do you mind?
Carl Miller, 162 Willow Street, apartment 4, Brooklyn.
he'll either be there or he'll be at Life Trace, where he has access to the computers.
planning his next attack. I'll check it out.
I'll hit the apartment.
perhaps you should rest, Mr. Kruger.
you've had quite a day.
got anything to eat around here?
just sencha green tea and a box of doggie treats.
I don't suppose what you're working on over there concerns me.
I'm trying to triangulate the location of the call you received in the elevator.
did you recognize anything about the caller?
no, nothing.
I'd prefer you didn't do that.
I'd prefer you mind your own business.
that's a tad ironic, coming from a man of your profession.
meaning what? - Meaning your business is minding everyone else's business.
I do what I do to simplify and improve other people's lives. What is it that you do?
we help people out of difficult situations, even situations of their own design.
so it's my fault that some wacko's trying to kill me?
the man lost his daughter, Mr. Kruger, to a stalker who was aided by your service. You feel no accountability?
I'm part of a $300 billion-a-year industry.
information abuses are unfortunate, but they happen. can't be helped.
Oh, they can, but only if the people who have access to the information are as interested in protecting it as they are in profiting from it.
I was just checking to see if my wife had called.
I want to make sure she was okay.
Mr. Kruger, I didn't want you using the phone because it might not be safe, but if you must check your messages,
we can go through your phone carrier's web portal.
need my password?
you have a message. - Mr. Kruger, Pete Collier.
I spoke with my colleagues and they agreed we should all sit down again.
if you could meet us at the Mayfield at 9: 30, that should give us enough time before our flight.
we'll meet you in the east dining room.
Yes, yes! If I leave now, I can still make it.
and what about your wife?
I'll call her on the way.
Mr. Kruger, wait.
the message, it's not labeled as "New."
someone else must have listened to it first.
who?
Sommers! - And if he's listened to it, he'll be waiting for you at the hotel.
it's too dangerous. - I don't care, there's too much riding on this deal.
all right, I'll contact my associates,
then have them meet us at the hotel.
okay, okay, Bear. Goodness.
Finch. - Mr. Reese...
Kruger's gone.
I made the mistake of turning my back on him.
are you all right? - I will be.
it would appear that Bear slowed Kruger down.
he's making his way to the Mayfield Hotel to take a meeting with the Riverton people.
I believe that Sommers knows that as well.
I'm at his locker now.
he's been stalking Kruger, just like his own daughter was stalked.
and ultimately killed.
I'll get over to the Mayfield.
something else, Mr. Reese.
Kruger's not only a potential victim, he may also now be a perpetrator.
I cannot believe this is happening!
someone is screwing with me. Can't you see that?
I'm gonna fix this.
looking for someone?
easy.
I won't miss at this range.
so what was the plan?
were you gonna take me out before or after my meeting?
I hadn't decided yet.
you know, you've caused me a great deal of pain and suffering, Mr. Sommers.
that was the point.
now, you're gonna help me get it all back.
Mr. Kruger, you got my message.
What...happened to you?
you know, I'm... really glad you asked.
Where's the rest of your team?
unfortunately, they had to catch an earlier flight. They send their regrets.
hello.
Yeah. This is Mr. Sommers.
look, I thought we were gonna discuss our deal.
Yes, well, shortly after I called you.
we attempted to revisit the issue with our CEO, - but we couldn't get him to reconsider his decision. - What?
I'm sorry, I thought a face-to-face would be better than another phone call.
no. - Excuse me?
No!
you have no idea what I've been through to get here!
Mr. Kruger, why do you have a gun?
because this man humiliated me, stole from me, and even tried to kill me.
it was his twisted little game that made our deal fall apart.
tell him. - Okay, just, let's put down the gun.
I said tell him!
don't do it, Mr. Sommers.
who are you?
someone who knows what this is about.
then you know he killed her, and something had to be done.
I never touched your daughter.
you may not have put your hands on her like that monster did, but ...
you're just as guilty. - I didn't do anything!
exactly.
see, her ex-boyfriend found her three times
three times, using your Life Trace.
and every time he found her, we asked the company to take her information down, and they didn't do it, and so he found her again, and again, until the last time when he killed her.
all because you and your company didn't do anything.
I didn't know.
I'm sorry. - Yeah?
sorry isn't good enough. - Listen to me, Stu.
you do this, and your life...
it's over.
it's already over. - Stu...
this isn't the way to honor your daughter's memory.
think about it. What would Chloe want?
you did the right thing, for both of you.
Mr. Reese, I triangulated the call that Kruger received in the elevator.
it's now coming from inside the Mayfield.
Mr. Reese?
you were right.
something had to be done, Which is why we reached out to you, Mr. Sommers.
you--you did it. You sent me the package.
we sent you the means to exact justice for your daughter, and you had the courage to act.
unfortunately, the car crash wasn't successful...
requiring this improvisation, but everything worked out in the end.
you should go now, Mr. Sommers.
I think you understand now. - Understand what?
what is lost when your privacy's stripped away.
your identity, your job, your family, security, everything.
you...
and thousands more just like me.
people who have chosen action over apathy, to take back what men like you and the government have stolen.
this wasn't a game, Mr. Kruger, this was a lesson, the first.
we were just gonna scare you, but...
that wouldn't change anything, would it?
Finch. - John, are you shot?
my vest caught it. Think my rib's broken.
and Kruger?
he's dead, Finch.
I got him. Can you walk?
I need to get to Collier.
we've got to get you out of here.
she's right, Mr. Reese. Another time.
back for more?
I need to say something.
can it wait until after you buy me coffee?
I know you had to take a partner to get back on days, but did you know that two other rookies were supposed to be in this seat before me?
and both requested to be reassigned. - If you want another F. T.O.just say the word.
no, that's the point, I didn't ask to be reassigned, because I chose you.
chose me? Why?
in the academy, I heard about you.
your work with the homicide task force and how you took down those corrupt cops.
I thought,"Someday, that's what I want to do.
that's why I jumped at the chance to train under you.
but I don't get the sense that you want to train anybody, and if that's the case, then I'd prefer it if you just cut me loose.
3-Adam-10, we got a report of a 10-53 near Morris and 149th.
Roger, dispatch. 3-adam-10 responding.
I made a call to Riverton's home office.
seems Collier, no doubt an alias, has not returned to work.
and I don't think he will.
he started four months ago as V. P. of customer analytics, a position that allowed him to get close enough to Kruger so that he could both witness and participate in the dismantling of his life.
he told Kruger there were others like him.
Yes, and I'm inclined to believe him.
I discovered that the anonymous packages sent to Mr. Sommers and the others came through mail-processing centers scattered all over the country.
could've saved on the postage and just shot him when they had the chance.
I'm just saying it was an elaborate plan.
it wasn't just about killing Kruger.
it was about giving the people he hurt a chance at retribution.
and also putting an ideology into action.
collier referred to Kruger's murder as "A lesson."
the first.
I fear that whatever his organization's ultimate goals may be, this could be just the beginning.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror but it sees everything
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considered these people irrelevant. We don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you'll never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
I've got this. - No, you don't.
you're gonna blow our cover.
I'm rowing this boat. - Not on my watch.
given your cover, it might be more appropriate for Mr. Reese to have the privilege, Ms. Shaw.
you are supposed to be on a date, after all.
you're welcome.
so who's our Romeo?
his name is Ian Murphy.
he's a successful investor in a variety of businesses
a coffee house, a nightclub, a microbrewery.
how's his portfolio?
maybe he owes money to the wrong people.
no, all his businesses are doing quite well, And he has a stellar credit report.
he grew up quite destitute.
his parents both died when he was just a teenager, and then a kindly uncle left him nearly $100, 000.
I suggest that one of you gets to Murphy's apartment in soho before he returns.
what do you say we pick it up over the weekend? I'll make you dinner.
I happen to be a great chef.
a guy who knows his opera and can cook. I'm impressed.
is that a yes? - It's an absolutely.
we gotta head back. I gotta be Uptown in 20.
I'll go to his apartment, Finch. See what I can find.
okay, but it's my turn to row this thing.
I think I got something.
I hope it's regarding his phone, because I've lost our connection.
I may know why. Our guy just went from blue blood to hipster faster than you can say "ironic facial hair."
I don't understand anything you just said.
he ditched his date, changed his clothes, his whole appearance.
so this guy's up to something and I'm betting it's nothing good.
just arrived at Murphy's apartment.
Shaw, you got an update on murphy?
it appears our boy's a ladies' man.
I followed him to some dive in the village.
new image, new girl.
guy's a chameleon.
organized, efficient, sociopathic.
not that there's anything wrong with that.
it seems Mr. Murphy finds his dates online.
he meets most of the women on smartphone applications like Tinder and Angler.
members put up a profile and then sign in at a given location.
so much for keeping the mystery alive in a relationship.
Finch, he's keeping records.
detailed files, tracking dozens of women.
Where's he getting the information?
from your typical stalker sites.
anything that promises a decent background check.
it's like he's hunting them.
why don't we just take him out now?
just because he's a stalker doesn't mean he's a killer, Ms. Shaw.
I wouldn't be so sure, Finch.
he's got a missing persons flyer for a woman named Jenna Lakritz.
and there is an article he printed out...
about a woman who died last week.
says it was a car accident.
car accident's a good way to cover up a homicide.
exactly what I was thinking.
this guy may have graduated from stalker to killer after all.
no, Ma'am. We're still searching hospitals, but we're closing in on her.
she worked on his desk for nearly six months.
knew about the program.
I have a feeling Ms. May knows exactly where Northern Lights is located.
if not, at least we'll know for sure.
then I'll take care of her.
maybe a few decades in a black site. Or something less cushy.
Yes, Ma'am. I'll call you as soon as I have a location.
you seem calmer today, Robin.
I am.
it's almost time for me to leave.
where is it that you're going?
you know, that's a good question. I'm not certain yet.
because the voice is going to tell you?
you're catching on.
is the voice speaking to you right now?
does it look like I'm talking to anyone other than you, Doctor?
you--you realize that phone Isn't connected to a wireless carrier.
God doesn't need AT&T.
haven't I already proved to you just how powerful she is?
you've certainly proven the power of...your mind.
you've demonstrated great intelligence and no doubt computer skills.
which is how you learned all those nasty things about me.
you know, Robin, we're all fallible. - Not all of us.
I suppose it's you who needs therapy.
it sounds like you have a lot to work on.
I can help you, Robin.
you suffer from delusions of grandeur, something caused by your underlying condition.
it's not a condition. It's the future.
by the time you figure out what's really happening,
I'll have transcended this reality.
why does your transcendence require your imprisonment in this facility?
she has a plan.
which is what?
I don't know yet.
but I can't wait to find out.
anything on the women Murphy's stalking?
the missing woman, Jenna Lakritz, Is a former girlfriend of his.
I'm able to look at her cell history, But Mr. Murphy uses VanishText, an application designed to delete his messages as soon as they've been read.
good for cheaters... and killers.
what about the girl that was killed last week?
daughter of Bruce Wellington.
auction house owner, philanthropist, real estate magnate.
can't seem to find anything connecting her to our Mr. Murphy, except for the fact that they attended the same college.
Mr. Reese, you didn't happen to purchase a new collar for Bear, did you?
or this gigantic cow femur that he's eating?
I've been a little busy, Finch.
seems Bear has a stalker of his own.
as for Mr. Murphy, he frequents a club called "Blur."
I ran the names from the files you discovered against women who use the angler application.
all of them have checked into that club at least once.
I'll head there tonight.
I'll just access the club's database and create a reservation for you.
hold off on that. I may have another idea.
we don't have enough proof to call the cops.
that doesn't mean we can't set up a trap of our own.
what are you suggesting?
till we can figure out if he's a killer or not,
I say we stack the deck.
Yeah. - Hello, Detective.
I was hoping you could come by the safe house tonight.
I think I can assure you it'll be more interesting than arresting aging corporate attorneys for driving under the influence.
you wanna give me the headlines?
only that it will require evening attire.
what I mean to say is, something elegant, but also...
less than conservative.
just what kind of job is this, Finch?
not bad.
considering the last time I saw you, you were in a body bag.
I've been in worse places.
I think this just might work.
so...this is where the party is.
ms. Morgan. This is Ms. Shaw, and you know Detective Carter.
heard you came back from the dead.
only eight more lives left.
Zanotti's? - Good eye.
so we're your bait.
rather a crude way of putting it, but I suppose it's apt.
our target is a chameleon and probable killer.
just once, I wish you fellas would call with something that didn't require a firearm.
Why? Are you not carrying?
I know better than to show up unprepared.
you have the Nano? - yeah.
I've been dying for one of these. - You can borrow it any time.
it's pretty.
little gift from John. - And...
now that everyone is sufficiently well-armed,
I've taken the liberty of creating profiles for all of you on Angler.
so please, download this application onto your phones so that you can check in once you arrive at the club.
I'd like to see that profile.
Really?
a yoga instructor?
you'd prefer trained killer?
Mr. Murphy favors this application when looking for new targets.
and as far as getting his attention,
I doubt that will be an issue.
you'll have to use your charm, Shaw...
not your sidearm.
I hope that's not a problem.
what is that supposed to mean?
I don't look good?'cause I think I look good.
you look fine, Shaw.
you just look...angry all the time.
we'll work on it in the car.
so where's our target?
manager says he shows around midnight.
then what are we doing here so early?
I was not gonna let those boys send us off as killer bait without getting something in return.
I like your style.
sorry, girls, my system only runs on diesel.
so what should we drink to?
here's hoping nobody gets serial killed.
okay, ladies, time for us to check in.
how you doing up there, Fusco?
Yeah, all clear.
although this place is a rip-off.
club soda cost me $5.
nice view though.
Joss. Relax.
Lionel's upstairs, John's outside.
Shaw's ready to shoot anybody who looks at her sideways.
let's go have fun.
I second that.
OK. OK.
Hey. - heyHow you doing?
heads up, ladies. Our boy just landed.
do you mind if I join you?
sure.
so I got a lot of respect for what you do, Joss.
it's a scary world out there.
very true.
you never know what kinda creeps you'll run into.
I can't believe that they allow cops to be so sexy though.
there should be a law against that.
all right. I should know better than to give you a line.
I do like the way you smile though. - Another line.
no, not even a little bit.
let me make you dinner tomorrow night.
I'll work on my witty banter.
I happen to be a great cook. It's one of my many talents.
this is our chance, Detective Carter.
please say yes.
Yes. - Yes!
heads up, partner. Our guy's watching you.
now he's tailing you.
he's still on your tail, So don't go home, okay?
where am I supposed to go, Fusco?
are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good.
Where'd he go?
I saw the guy disappear up the street.
safe to say if he was looking for his next victim, he found her.
Where's Mr. Reese?
staying out with Carter till her date tonight.
good boy.
I have had some luck tracing the money he received nine years ago.
I thought it came from his uncle.
actually, it came from a shell corporation out of Switzerland, funded by Bruce Wellington.
so there's a connection to the dead girl after all.
look.
this is a GPS map of one of Murphy's sim cards.
he was in the Hamptons last week.
same day as Dana Wellington's funeral.
sicko was probably reliving his crime.
maybe Carter can get more info on her date.
so what are we having?
don't worry. Nothing with tree nuts.
how did you know I was allergic?
I pay attention. See, if more guys did that, they'd find the opposite sex less confusing.
that's not an answer.
you pushed away a little bowl of almonds at the club.
your face said it was out of protection, so, severe nut allergy, hmm?
you'd make a good detective.
you know, that's funny.
I was thinking the same thing about you.
what do you mean?
the way you were watching everyone in the club.
I know your Angler profile says you're an officer, but...you seem more like a detective to me.
well.
I was a detective. Homicide.
but I'm doing something different now.
it's not where I thought I would wind up, but it's where I need to be right now.
well...
what's he doing? Should I shoot him? - Not yet.
what?
sorry. Just shiitake mushrooms.
I wasn't making a move, yet.
she doesn't have her guard up. - You're joking.
that woman's got a guard of steel.
you two have thing or something?
cause, I mean, I clocked you and Zoe right off the bat, but I never thought you and Carter
we're just friends.
your "just friend" is doing her job.
she gets this guy to trust her, maybe he makes a move.
and we can finally shoot him.
so what do you do for a living, Ian?
I own pieces of a bunch of small companies.
how did you get started? Help from friends or family?
kinda.
I've been an emancipated minor since I was 17.
one day I'm in college, some lawyer shows up with a check for 100 grand.
from some uncle I've never met, and all of a sudden I had these options.
never really had those before.
so I started my own business.
if I was gonna be alone,
I was gonna do it on my own terms.
So...how long have you and Zoe been...special friends?
I haven't really counted the days, Shaw.
what about you?
any big dates lately?
been too busy saving the world from bad guys.
besides, relationships are for amateurs.
guys these days have so many...emotions.
they cry, they wanna be held. I just don't know what to do with them.
so you--you're a nun?
I'm a pragmatist, John.
I go out, have a fun night, or three.
and then, uh, I move on, you know? No muss, no fuss.
password, please.
my hands are a little shaky.
side effect from the thorazine, I suppose. Would you mind typing it in for me?
thank you.
prescription from Dr. Ronald Carmichael.
Desflurane. Two vials, please.
no, make it three.
you didn't have to walk me out.
I didn't want you waiting for a cab all by yourself.
I know, you're a cop, but
but you're a gentleman. - I try.
I had a really nice time with you tonight, Joss.
Yeah, I did too.
and you know what, you were right.
that was the best Chilean sea bass I've ever had. - Good.
two bogies coming your way, Carter.
all right. All right, guys.
no need for violence, guys. Just, you know, take what you want.
unfortunately for you, Ian, we're not here for your wallet.
ready? - Ready, ready.
nice aim, Shaw.
back at you.
Ian, are you okay?
Yeah. I'd be a hell of a lot better if you told me who you actually were, Joss.
Hey! I got some interesting information from muggers dumb and dumber.
I imagine they were hired hands? - Bingo.
said a guy by the name of Kip Davis hired them.
I made a few calls, found out this guy, Davis, head of security for Bruce Wellington.
and that's certainly not a coincidence.
thank you, Detective.
I get that, but how did you know that someone was gonna come after me?
we had inside information that someone wanted you dead.
or maybe it was the other way around.
wait.
W--you th--you think I'd hurt someone?
we've seen your stalker stash, Ian.
it's not stalking.
it's research.
women like that I can anticipate their needs.
they're used to guys doing the bare minimum.
I go above and beyond.
try it sometime.
you're hunting them.
I want their info, they're giving it to me straight up.
and, yeah, I get a little overly efficient in my due diligence, But...
they like it.
if they liked it so much, how come those relationships don't last?
they're not supposed to.
it's kind of the point.
Mr. Murphy, why would Bruce Wellington want you dead?
were you involved with his daughter?
Ian. Tell us what's going on so we can help you.
Dana and I...
we met when she was still in college and I was tending bar, trying to keep up with my student loans, and we fell in love.
no research needed.
Mr. Fortune 500 did not appreciate his daughter dating poor white southie trash, but...
then Dana got pregnant.
now you gotta understand this.
Wellington, he rules that family with an iron fist. So...
one day one of Wellington's lackeys shows up at my door and he tells me that, Dana got an abortion, and, he gives me a check, and he says that I have to get out of town or Wellington'll ruin me.
so you took the money?
Dana was all I had in the world.
and I must have called her a hundred times, and she...
never called me back.
she was terrified of her father. They all were.
and that was nine years ago.
and I haven't had anything to do with her or her family since.
until you went to her funeral.
how could I not go?
wellington saw me and he flipped out and started screaming, right there at Dana's grave.
why would he be so upset with you after all this time?
I don't know, Joss.
I swear.
I didn't stay to find out.
I like Bear's new collar. - Seemed more his style.
that dinosaur bone from you as well?
Yeah, he loves that thing.
his intestines beg to differ.
Shaw. Take a look at this.
are you both seeing what I'm seeing?
that kid's what? Eight? Nine?
I suppose we now know why Mr. Wellington wants Ian dead.
Dana didn't have an abortion after all.
daddy probably figured Ian showed up at the funeral to take away his heir.
I think it's time we meet Mr. Wellington in person.
what should Detective Carter tell Ian?
the truth.
I don't understand.
Dana's sister, Marissa, raised him as her own.
she was ten years older. I imagine she seemed like a more suitable parent at the time.
how could they do this to me?
why would Dana lie?
like you said, Mr. Wellington is a very powerful man, willing to do anything to keep up appearances.
Dana knew that a lie was the only thing that would get you to leave Boston.
so he gets to take everything from me. My--my home and - my--my child?- No, Ian. He doesn't.
because we're going to set things right. - How?
Finch is going to break into the kid's locker, take Alex's school-issued water bottle, and use it for the DNA test.
sounds like a safe enough plan. I'm going with him.
it's not safe, Ian. - All I wanna do is put eyes on my son, Joss.
in case I don't get the chance again.
sir?
ms. Morgan.
ms. Morgan.
thank you for meeting with us, Mr. Wellington.
and how's our mutual friend?
she sends her best.
this is John Wiley, the collector she told you about.
Zoe says you're a man who can find things no one else can.
she flatters me, but it's also true.
I'm looking for a privately owned Picasso. Child With a Dove.
I'm willing to pay whatever it takes.
if you boys will excuse me,
I need to powder my nose.
nice entrance. - Thanks. Where's the safe?
old school. - Excellent.
you know, proving the kid is Ian's may not get Wellington off his back.
I'm just the safecracker.
I leave the messy stuff to Harold.
you better hurry up, Shaw.
looks like Wellington is about to take his grandson on a long trip outside the country.
where are they taking him?
Alex has been enrolled at a London boarding school. They leave tomorrow morning.
so it's over.
even if we get a DNA sample, that won't stop Wellington from trying to kill me.
it will if we leverage the child's paternity.
the Wellington legacy is all he cares about.
I can assure you, a man like this will do anything to protect his name.
excuse me for a moment.
black. Kilo. Tango.
penguin. Alpha. Kilo.
stone Ranch hospital.
Yes, hello. I was calling to check up on Ms. Robin Farrow.
this's her uncle, Harold Wren.
Hello, Mr. Wren.
Robin is doing quite well.
although you're the second person to call on her today.
who was the first?
he wouldn't give us a name, so we wouldn't give him any information.
Where's Joseph?
he, uh, called in sick today.
I'm Ian. So, um, buckle up.
I already did.
Mr. Reese.
I believe Mr. Murphy just kidnapped his son.
his birth certificate isn't here.
it takes days to run DNA.
the Wellingtons leave the country tomorrow. - Reese.
you're right, that is a lovely depiction of postmodernism.
but, may I ask you something?
what's that, Mr. Wiley?
where is your grandson's birth certificate?
you stole a child from his father.
Alex has a father. - No.
Alex has an aunt and an uncle who raised him as their own.
I'm going to ask you one more time, Mr. Wellington.
where is your grandson's birth certificate?
my grandson will never know that piece of white trash is his father.
Alex is an heir, not the help.
security will show you out.
if you weren't gonna do that, I was.
okay. What do we do now?
Ian, where are you?
I just did something really stupid.
I usually go home right after school.
Yeah, I thought we could do something different today.
Why? What's today?
I-I knew your mom a long time ago.
well, She gets mad if I come home late.
right.
I'm sure she doesn't.
what I meant to say was I knew your aunt Dana.
aunt Dana died. - Yeah, I know.
and I know that makes you really sad.
makes me sad too.
to have someone you love just vanish from your life.
it's hard to understand, even when you're grown up.
how did you know her?
from school? - Yeah.
see?
we were good friends.
she used to read me stories when I was little.
then I got older and--and she let me read to her.
she liked Harry Potter.
I wish I hadn't lost touch with her.
I wish I had...
met you a lot sooner.
Why?
you seem like someone I'd really like to know.
Alex. I'm Officer Carter, here to take you home.
but first I need to talk to my friend Ian for a minute.
tell you what.
why don't you go buy yourself an ice cream, okay? - Okay.
I knew it was a stupid move the second I did it, but that's
I just found out that I have a son.
now these people, they wanna just take him away from me again?
I'm not gonna let that happen, Ian, But we gotta do this right.
Hey! - I never told you how much I liked the uniform.
another line? - Not even a little.
friend of mine knows people who know people that have dirt on doctors to the rich and famous.
I'm about to submit that into evidence.
so, are you ready to be a father for real?
more than you could possibly know.
I'm happy for you.
and for Alex.
happy enough to celebrate over a drink?
maybe after the dust settles.
you still have my number. - Yeah.
what's different about you tonight, Robin?
I feel relieved. Like a great weight's been lifted.
I'm so pleased to hear that. It sounds like your medication is working.
no. It's finally time for me to leave.
I see. Okay, Robin, the only way you can leave this facility is with my signature, which you're not gonna get any time soon.
you need to start participating in your therapy.
it's the only way to get well.
I am participating.
and it's been...educational, to say the least, but there's a government operative who's coming to kill me, which means you and I have run out of time.
okay, that sounds to me like what we call a persecution complex.
he's quite real, I assure you.
so, you see, sadly, I need to be moving on.
okay. So, you're going to escape?
and how do you plan on doing that?
first the phone on your desk will ring.
she'll be letting me know it's time.
then I'll punch you in the carotid artery.
it'll hurt, Ronald, but it won't kill you.
then I'll take your car keys.
and the guards, how--how will you manage them?
I won't have to.
they'll be incapacitated from the desflurane in the ventilation system.
it vaporizes at 75 degrees.
which the building climate control has been programmed to reach ten minutes ago.
okay, this voice that you hear, she is--she's gonna do all this?
of course not.
she sees everything, but...
there's very little she can do about it herself.
that's where I come in.
she tells me what to do and I do it.
she did help me a little with stealing the desflurane from the automatic dispensing system.
don't worry.
I closed the vents in your office two days ago.
it should have cleared out by now.
do you hear how quiet it is out there?
must be almost time.
are you as excited about this as I am?
how long are you gonna keep him waiting?
he promised to walk me home.
very chivalrous of him.
okay, fine.
I should probably get going.
Yeah, I need to go too.
I have a date. With my son.
nice work tonight, ladies.
good night.
what do you think?
you wanna get out of here?
okay.
but you're sleeping at my place.
hello there.
Oh, my God.
what have you done?
don't worry. I didn't kill them.
like you said, I've been making progress.
the man coming after me, on the other hand, will almost certainly kill you, so...
you probably should run.
pardon me.
did you really think she would abandon me?
Really? Even this guy?
I guess you're the boss.
so long, Doc.
and thanks for all the help.
I think I really am much better now.
Finch, what's wrong? - Mr. Reese, we have a problem.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considers these people irrelevant.
we don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
you won't believe what The Swede has been doing- going to the therapy.
how much does the therapist know?
are you resting comfortably?
Yes. But I should tell you that,
I don't really believe in hypnotism.
the act of hypnosis is freewill.
for me to proceed, your mind must grant the permission.
will it work on me the first time?
most of my clients experience results in three to five sessions.
so we'll work on your anxiety and paranoia gradually.
see, Mr. Wren, hypnosis is merely relaxation combined with imagery.
you experience it every night as you drift asleep, focus on a book, or miss your exit on the FDR.
ready? - I think so, yes.
then let's begin. Please pick up the tablet beside you, and choose an image that speaks to your emotion.
Oh, this one.
I want you to close your eyes and form a mental picture of that image.
picture the birds, the field.
then one by one, picture them as they fly away.
focus on your breathing. One bird departs.
and as each one goes, your relaxation increases and you continue to feel calmer and more at rest.
for 200 bucks an hour, Finch, I hope you get more than an expensive nap.
I want to take you back to a place in your life where you were safe and comfortable.
can you think of that place, Mr. Wren?
my childhood bedroom.
now, I want you to think of all the ways it made you feel safe.
picture it clear as day. What color were the walls?
Hayden Price- certified hypnotherapist to the Upper East Side.
does he do birthday parties?
it's not that kind of hypnotism, Mr. Reese.
he caters to wealthy businessmen and socialites.
anger management, smoking cessation, that sort of thing.
or so you might think, if you didn't know that the office was rented on a short-term lease, and that his certification doesn't come from any association I can find.
during the therapy,
I became attuned to the kind of questions that Hayden was asking.
a color that's favorable to you- blue.
the name of a childhood pet- Scout.
he was fishing
getting answers to your security questions.
my bank account was suddenly signed up for a recurring automatic donation to the nonprofit called "The American Cancer Coalition Fund.
I'd be willing the wager that Hayden's name is on that nonprofit.
so, unless he's moonlighting as a Samaritan,
I'd say we're dealing with a con artist and a very clever thief.
so why'd you even play along, Finch?
I told Hayden what he wanted to hear. I didn't even have a pet as a child.
but when I went to bluejack his phone, it was blocked.
someone had already jacked it, perhaps someone who's out to get him.
and his clients would be the best place to start.
I'll contact Shaw for back-up, but first I need to look in on our houseguest.
as before, Ms. Groves, Mr. Reese is upstairs with an unhealthy number of firearms.
please don't try to run.
honestly, Harold, locking me up?
I admit that the accommodations are not ideal.
but your confinement is for your own good.
Harold, your machine called me.
an event that I haven't fully reasoned out.
but your unpredictability, your willingness to hurt others make you as dangerous as ever.
you can't fight the future.
I'll bring you some new books.
I get it.
you wonder why it won't talk to you like it talks to me.
don't be jealous, Harold.
mom still loves us both.
when bluejacking Hayden didn't work, I sent him a basket of pastries as a thank you.
bugged, of course.
I'm just so angry with her, I could kill her.
and those feelings will dissipate as you feel calmer, Mr. Sykes.
tell me about your mother.
speak her name, out loud- her full name.
Mary Shackford Sykes. - Very good.
that's a start.
it seems therapy has helped, Sven.
I haven't been able to sleep this well in months.
and do you still believe you're surrounded by phonies?
sadly, yes.
but thanks to you, I'm able to push past, to rediscover the quality and craft of my antique business, search for the meaning in my work.
sounds like Hayden isn't a half-bad therapist after all.
a lot of patients today?
anybody weird? Wall-to-wall mommy issues.
enough to make a man want to smoke.
or under-sleep or over-eat or
or?
who's the girl, Finch? Her name is Natalie Boal.
she works at an art gallery downtown.
she started coming to Hayden for therapy a little over a year ago.
it's more than therapy now. Ugh, look at that.
he isn't working her, he's in love. And if she's making those eyes at him,
I bet she doesn't know about his criminal side.
someday, no more patients.
no more psychoses.
no more snooty art buyers.
just you and me.
we just go to the airport...
jet off to some corner of the world.
right.
with what money, again? Let me worry about that.
and when I get enough, it's just you and me and paradise.
Hayden's on the move, Finch.
according to his schedule, he doesn't have any more appointments today.
so where is he going so fast?
there you go. - Thank you.
so, is everything in order?
relax.
there's nothing to worry over.
the exchange rates are in your favor.
I started as a teller at that S&L, you know?
15 years I put in, and then they tell me I need to take a pay cut.
so I decided they owed me a pay raise.
here's my $50, 000, Mr. Russell.
Where's yours?
outstanding. Let's proceed.
I'm so gonna shoot this punk.
something's not right.
we're meeting your contact here?
it's quiet up here, and far from nosy thieves looking for cash.
no. The only thief here is you.
detective Decker, NYPD. Fraud investigation.
hands up, sucker.
sucker?
I can only guess what he got you for, pal.
he feed you that line of crap about the exchange rates?
and you, pass me that briefcase very slowly.
not today.
Oh, God.
Mr. Reese, Ms. Shaw, why aren't you intervening?
wait for it.
is he gone? With his tail between his legs.
we really hooked that fish for 20 Gs?
sure did. 20? I thought it was 50.
here's your half.
now let's get the hell out of here before somebody calls the real cops.
who isn't Hayden ripping off?
this guy's good.
I can watch you nursing that coffee for just so long.
you should know I called, to check in on you, Joss.
well, parking tickets and purse snatchers aren't exactly a challenge after my old job, Mr. Quinn.
Alonzo, please.
the last time we met, you said you had suspicions about my godson's murder.
I tried working a few leads, but Cal's department file was sealed.
there is a chance here that the organization HR could be involved.
I thought HR was disbanded.
the feds just scattered the roaches.
it's sometimes hard to get 'em all.
maybe I can get the Mayor involved, open doors for you at One PP.
I wouldn't wanna put you in that kind of position, Mr. Quinn.
I'll take my chances on this one solo.
all right.
I'm sorry, my shift is starting, and I have a rookie partner to pick up.
saddled you with a rookie, huh? Goes with the parking tickets and purse snatchers.
thanks for the coffee.
she gonna be trouble?
despite Hayden's criminality and his malfeasant theatrics,
I still think it's more likely that someone is out to get him than the other way around.
someone who bluejacked his phone.
maybe one of his clients is on to his scam.
Hayden may have conned any number of people, and all it takes is one easy mark with ties to a gang or organized crime, so we don't have a moment to waste.
if you and Ms. Shaw could visit some of his more irascible clients,
I'll text you their names and addresses on my way.
on your way to where? - Back to therapy.
Mr. Wren, when I snap my fingers, you will come totally out of your resting state feeling refreshed and relieved after our conversation.
so how did it go this time? Quite well.
you're making very solid progress, Mr. Wren.
but sadly, our time is up for the day.
you really are very good at this, Mr. Price.
I'm so glad that I was referred to you.
where did you receive your training? The Barringer Hypnosis Institute.
Oh, here in New York? - Of Tarzana, California.
I don't believe I know it. What brought you all the way out here?
you know, I'm usually the one asking the questions, Mr. Wren.
who was it you said referred you to me again?
Oh, look at that. You're right.
our time is up for the day.
Hey, kid, come here.
Yes, sir.
Terney says you've been keeping an eye on Carter.
Yes, sir.
willing to step up, get your hands dirty? - What does that mean?
well, we're having trouble with a money launderer. Guy messed up big.
but we need him to finish one more job.
then you pull his card, dig a hole.
rest in peace.
who's the guy? The target?
come on, kid. We're taking a field trip.
and we're selling the soccer ball. And I have your bid at $300, 000.
now 310, 000. 310, 000 right here. 320, 000.
Hey, what are we doing here?
that's your guy.
his name is Sven.
he's an antique dealer down in The Village.
we call him "The Swede.
so, what's your story? - You first.
I'm following an HR lead.
they wanna whack a Swedish antique dealer for screwing up their money laundering.
that's funny.
I'm on a con man therapist who happens to have a Swedish antique dealer as a patient.
I'll pretend that makes sense.
I think my con man might be after your Swede and his laundered money.
well, if that's HR's money, your con man is in for a world of hurt.
I'll stick with the con man, keep him out of trouble.
I'll stick with the antique dealer, see where he leads.
we are going once.
we are going twice.
fair warning on this 1911 Honus Wagner baseball card.
is sold, right here.
number 103 for $900, 000.
tomorrow, you're gonna punch that guy's ticket.
well, what do you know?
what's the Swede's therapist doing here?
Hey, Finch, we need to find out why everyone's so interested in The Swede.
so Hayden's patient is an antiques dealer, and he spent a million dollars on a baseball card?
and then tossed it into some cabinet like it was junk.
I watched him do it. It's all very strange.
and what business does an antique dealer have laundering HR's money in the first place?
and why do they want him dead now?
turns out The Swede wasn't going to a real therapist.
he was spilling his guts to a con man.
we'll do a two for one special and take out the therapist also.
I love that.
you know, that dinner was such a surprise.
I had a lovely time.
that's not the only surprise.
let's do it, Nat. Let's take our trip.
just go to the airport and pick our destination.
come with me? - Hayden, are you serious?
what about our- our jobs, our lives? They'll be here for us when we get back.
I wanna be impulsive.
I wanna whisk away the girl I love.
Yes.
of course.
when do we leave? That's the other surprise.
now. Well, tomorrow.
I need to do a few things. Pick you up in the AM?
I'll pack fast.
Finch, our con man's blowing the country fast.
something's up.
Oh, my God.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
who the hell are you? The night watch.
who were these guys?
the cops- the real cops.
what the hell is going on?
we were gonna ask you the same thing, Hayden.
I just spoke with Detective Carter.
she identified the badge numbers you gave me as HR. She's positive.
what's the deal, con man?
look. Someone just turned my office into Swiss cheese, and my girlfriend is waiting for me.
if she goes back to my place or to my office- I just spoke to Natalie a half an hour ago.
I explained to her how I was your new assistant and I needed to stash her in a motel until you'd visit her.
slight lie. But nothing on a par with you, Hayden.
that's funny coming from you, Mr. Wren.
we know you've been scamming your patients, and we know you've had your eye especially on a Mr. Vanger, the antique dealer. Did you know he was a money launderer for HR?
I've heard of HR, but I swear, I didn't know the money was theirs.
who'd you think you were grifting?
sven came into my office a couple of months ago.
he was a chain smoker who had millions bouncing around in his accounts.
it would have been an easy score. Look what happened.
I didn't sign up for real bullets.
I'm done with this con and I'm out of here.
Where's Natalie? - Nice try.
you're staying put. What don't you get about "Done"?
look. You want me out of town?
I'm out of town. But I can't go without her.
see, she's the only honest thing left about me.
I have to try and hold on to that.
detective, have you found out how the antique dealer is connected to HR's money laundering?
I'm meeting my source now. You haven't touched your wine, Joss.
you're off duty. I'm always on duty.
have you heard a word I said?
what do you think about the money being laundered? I heard every word.
and the money's just HR's skim off the Russians.
a percentage kicked back to your friends in blue for turning a blind eye to the Yogorov business.
please, try the Brunello di Montalcino.
the finish is quite exquisite.
what I don't understand is what HR wants with an antique business.
clean money.
see, HR doesn't want blood-soaked bills from the Russians.
they want their cut in ones and zeroes, to transfer into their 401Ks, offshore accounts.
so, the antique dealer cycles the dirty Russian money into his own accounts and waits for instructions.
then he heads to the auction house, where he's told to bid on a certain high-priced item, an item auctioned off by a seller representing HR.
our next item up for bid is lot number 426
an extremely rare baseball signed by all of the 1927 New York Yankees, including Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth.
informally named, "Murderer's Row Ball.
I'd like to start the bidding at $2 million.
I got a bid for $2 million. $4. 4 million. Where?
4. 4 in the front going once, twice.
sold right here, $4. 4 million. Thank you.
the Swede bids the highest, and all of that dirty money is deposited into HR's coffers, squeaky clean and laundered, and ready for digital distribution.
but I don't get it. They haven't laundered the money.
they've just bought an overpriced baseball.
all the items HR auctions off may have been appraised for millions of dollars, but they're really just fakes, worthless junk.
so HR gets Russian money for nothing?
it's a perfect system, till someone on the outside knows about it.
so if your con man thinks he can just swoop in and take a piece of HR's business, he better watch his back.
who do you always meet in there?
none of your business.
Carter, I've been thinking.
that antique dealer, I can't just kill someone.
when I got involved with HR, I didn't think
no, you didn't think.
you just looked the other way.
I can't do that anymore.
and you're the only person I've got on my side right now.
I'm not on your side.
but I'm also not letting a homicide happen under my watch.
so, tomorrow, you're calling in sick.
I am?
Yeah, see you just got a new job.
tomorrow, you're Simmons's shadow. Wherever he goes, you go.
whoever he meets with, you get pictures of.
see, we just tapped into their piggy bank.
now I wanna know who's running the bank.
what is going on? Where have you been?
what- Who is that creepy guy? Natalie, I'm so sorry.
I get a call from someone at your office telling me to come to some hotel, - and then you don't even show up. - It's okay.
you need to take a breath. The more you breathe, - the calmer you'll be. - No, no, no.
do not hypno-talk me. I'm not hypno-talking you.
I'm saying, just be calm- I'm not one of your patients.
I know that, I know that. You have to tell me
Finch, you ever notice how much of our job is like babysitting?
well, it's more than that today.
I don't think Hayden's told us the whole story of his con.
I'm going over Hayden's hard drive, what I downloaded of it before he zapped it.
and I'm finding emails addressed to Sven Vanger, the antique dealer.
Hayden may have elicited his email password while he was under hypnosis.
it appears that Hayden duplicated an email that Sven had received, but not yet read.
and he altered it in the process. - And what did the email say?
the email is from an anonymous address, regarding an auction that took place today.
in it, Vanger was instructed to bid on lot 424, but Hayden redrafted it, instructing him to bid on lot 426.
perhaps you should ask Hayden why.
he went out the window.
Finch, Hayden used his girlfriend and gave us all the slip.
I'm sorry. I'm about to close. - No, Sven, you're already closed.
who are you with, the Russians or the police?
I have nothing left for you. I'm not with either.
but I do need something- answers.
I'm not your doormat.
why don't you drop that before you hurt yourself, Sven?
give it to me.
why is it every time you call me these days,
I know to bring a firearm?
but he was such a good therapist.
Hey, Dragon Tattoo, he's also a con man who stole from you.
not stealing from me, stealing from them.
he should not be doing that. - How'd you even get into this mess?
seven months ago, I got in trouble with the customs here in New York.
a cop named Simmons came and said he could make the charges go away if I helped them launder cash for a few Russian associates of theirs.
at first, it was just a few hundred thousand each month.
then it became more and more- millions.
I got rid of the last cash today. On lot 426?
how did you know about that? - Hayden played you.
he switched out your emails, and made you bid on the wrong item today.
then what did I purchase?
a real ball, signed by the real 1927 Yankees, really worth 4. 4 million.
that was a hell of a season. Where's the ball, Sven?
it's gone.
I sold it for $5.
they're going to kill me. I gotta get out of this city immediately!
too late. You're a marked man.
close your eyes. This stuff burns.
so we're faking crime scenes now?
a long way from your days back at the Eighth.
might wanna spread it out.
arterial spray is more erratic. - Will you let me work?
going for a kind of a hollow-point special kind of motif.
there. - Congratulations.
you've just died and been reborn.
now, take your new life, and get the hell out of New York.
yeah? - Hey, rookie, I need you to hold off on the antique dealer.
something went wrong at the auction house. We didn't get our money.
sir, there's a small problem.
just heard from my source in HR, Simmons knows they get ripped off.
all this baseball stuff, you should've called me in sooner.
I'm kind of a Mets fan, though.
somewhere in the city, your soda kid's walking around with a zillion-dollar baseball in his pocket.
with HR looking for the ball.
and the young man has no idea.
let's hope he don't play catch.
Hey, kiddo, you got something for me?
I can't believe Hayden would use his own girlfriend as an excuse to escape.
I can. A baseball worth 4 million would be a motivational force.
Oh, he doesn't care who he steps on to get away with it either.
exactly. He still has to get away, but he won't go without Natalie.
as you and I well know, sometimes necessity and desire can conflict.
Hayden's still in the city.
he's too smart to use his own phone.
so how do we track him? - We don't. We track Natalie.
Hayden's calling her right now.
Nat, please, I'm sorry.
I've done things that I'm not proud of, but I love you.
can you trust me on that? - I wanna know what's going on right now.
that's a little complicated, Nat.
wait. Where are you? - I'm going home.
did you think I was just gonna sit in that hotel room after you went out the window?
no, honey, you can't go there.
it's not safe for you. - Really?
how would I even know? Look, Hayden, I love you.
but I deserve the truth, or else I'm done.
I'm a criminal and a thief.
but I'm done with that life.
I secured a score that will ensure our future.
the kind of score that would let us pick our destination.
if you meet me outside my old office in one hour, then we can fly to any corner of the world, like we planned.
and I'll tell you everything.
stop loving me or even hate me, but please hear me out.
I'll be there.
I didn't wanna worry you.
I'm cleanin' up this mess. You say The Swede bought the baseball?
that's what the logs at the auction house said.
but without him, it's gonna be a little tough to track him.
that idiot bought a real autographed ball worth $4. 4 million, and we had a rookie kill him before we found out what he did with it?
maybe the rookie should be handling your end of things.
at least he follows through.
but you said there was a con man involved.
Yeah. - Find him.
shake him till the damn ball falls out.
and tell me you have at least one lead.
when we tapped his phone, we found out about the con man's little girlfriend.
it seems the guy's in love. He ain't going anywhere without her.
make it right, Simmons.
I got two loves- my money and this city.
mess with either, I mess right back.
Hey, lover boy.
What'd you expect? I'm a crook.
he's my expert. What, you don't trust me?
like you said, you're a crook.
I don't know about expert, but it looks pretty damn real. I have a buyer lined up.
I'll split it with you, 50/50.
60/40? - Not a half bad deal, huh?
will you at least let me call Natalie before you kill me or arrest me or put me in a well in your basement?
you have 30 seconds.
sorry to disappoint, con man.
seems the NYPD isn't bad at phone traces.
I found your girl in 20 minutes.
I'll give you the ball. It's yours. - Don't be noble.
there's only criminals on this line. But I'll take the ball, just the same.
you meet me in front of the auction house in 20 minutes.
how bad is it? - They'll kill her.
these people, for this much money? So what are you gonna do to stop them?
I'm scum. I get it.
but Natalie
my ultimate con, my final trick was gonna be actually turning into the guy that she fell in love with.
I'll give it all away to save her life.
will you help me?
this is how it goes. Rookie stays outside with the girl.
Terney, take the con man inside, verify the ball is real.
I'm not taking any more chances with this clown.
why do I have to go inside? - Because that's what you were just told.
once we confirm the ball is the real deal,
Laskey takes the girl, puts a double tap in her head.
questions?
boss, uh, she doesn't know anything.
why don't we just let her go?
do I look like I'm taking suggestions - from rookies today? - No, sir.
the ball?
the girl.
I wanna talk to Natalie. You're going inside first.
one thing you can trust about a thief is he'll always be a thief.
I'm so sorry.
call me when there's money and bodies.
you were right, Carter.
they would never let her go.
make it look good.
remember, the aim shouldn't be to hurt him, just incapacitate him a little.
also, watch your knuckles.
I've punched a lot of guys.
so have I.
let's get you to safety. We've been through this already, it's real.
you think I'd be standing here if it wasn't? - We'll see.
I'll know in a minute.
I need a microscope to know for sure, but the texture appears accurate.
there is, however, a problem.
what?
see this? Babe Ruth's signature? - Yeah. What about it?
it's in felt-tip pen.
those didn't exist when Babe Ruth was alive.
this ball is a fake.
you give us a fake? You give us a fake?
you wanna die? - I swear, that is the real ball.
the real ball costs $4 million.
the fake is just gonna cost you a bullet, con man.
why would I lie?
you have to believe me. We can figure this out.
where is the real ball?
so where's the real ball?
I have no idea.
I thought this was the real ball.
forget that. Where's Natalie?
I put her in a cab, told her to go somewhere safe.
this is Natalie.
Nat, where are you? Are you okay?
Oh, I'm better than okay.
you see, that antique dealer
sven was his name- well, he may have been your big score, but you were my big whale, from the moment I met you.
you- you played me?
why steal millions from criminals when you can date the thief and take it off him?
keep the change.
of course, things did get a little hairy with those corrupt cops, but you always did know how to show a girl a good time, Hayden.
where will you go?
Oh, go find an airport, maybe just pick a destination.
isn't that the dream come true?
you know, I really did love you.
well, if you love something, set it free.
I'm ruined.
maybe it's time you went on the straight and narrow.
you'll live longer.
I hear hypnotherapists are in pretty high demand these days.
you know, I do have a thriving practice to rebuild.
I'm gonna need a new office with a few less bullet holes.
my advice?
rebuild in another city.
detective Terney, I can't help but notice you're not carrying a ball.
the ball the con man brought was a fake.
the guy with the suit showed up, rolled Laskey and our guys, and then got away with the con man and his girl.
do you have any idea what's at stake here?
you go find that screw-up Laskey and you scour this city until you find that ball.
Simmons, I'm not the rookie.
don't talk to me like one.
if you don't find that ball, then it's gonna be a $4 million funeral for the both of you.
now go.
I was just turning out the lights for the evening,
ms. Groves, and I remembered that I had promised to bring you some new reading material.
a peace offering, Harold? Is that what you've brought?
I really think if you could just see things my way, and not consider this
imprisonment?
is there any other way to consider it?
this truly is for your own good, Ms. Groves.
I mean that when I say it.
this synchronistic relationship that you've developed with the machine, it can't be
I worry about you.
you've misunderstood the situation.
you shouldn't worry about me.
I'm worried about you, Harold.
you can't stop what's coming, and neither can I.
but we have the opportunity to understand things when they finally change.
the future is coming.
you started it...
and I'll finish it.
you missed me. Leave a message.
Laskey, I'm outside your place.
we have a lot of work to do. Come on.
I stuck to the guy like glue.
this is everyone Simmons met with.
Thanks, kid, you did all right.
but you should know, it'll get harder out there.
after these last few days, things are gonna heat up.
so you need to be prepared.
Oh. When I got involved with HR,
I thought it was about loyalty.
I was wrong.
it's about murder and greed.
well, ain't that cozy.
I should've known she'd turn you, rookie.
the first time I saw you, I knew you were weak.
so let me tell you how the world works now, kid.
we kill her or they kill us.
that decision is gonna be your last, Terney.
No!
that much blood, and you'll be dead in a minute, maybe two.
make 'em count.
who do you and Simmons report to?
who calls the shots?
is the answer in these pictures, huh?
last chance, Terney! Be a cop!
what do you want from me?!
where are we? - I don't know.
we're all hostages.
I don't get it. What kind of kidnapping is this?!
biometric implants.
we're all carrying a load of tranquilizer around.
you walk past a certain point out there, You trigger the implant.
kill your neighbor and you'll go free
okay, I'm almost done.
they've got it right up against the muscle,
so you've got to hold still.
okay, almost done.
okay. Okay, I got it. I got it.
got it.
okay, who's next? - Me.
let me just stitch him up.
just one more. One more.
you ready?
Oh, god!
wait, wait!
wait a minute! Wait!
a five-foot lead.
this will give me enough room to pull you back
if anything happens like before.
take it slow.
can't be sure it was the implant that actually knocked us out.
am I good?
you're good. You're good. Yep.
all right, you're there at the spot.
you're sure this is where we collapsed?
mark it.
now take another step, slowly.
all right, mark it.
looking good. Looking good.
all right, mark it.
looking good.
all right, mark it.
looking good.
all right. Mark another one.
Hey, hey, hold up! Hold up!
hold up! Hey, let go, let go, let go!
Hey, hey, hey!
listen.
all I want is to see my daughter
whatever this is, whatever you want...
...there must be something, anything.
I need to know that she's all right.
just give me a chance to make sure she's safe,
and then I'll do whatever you say.
I'm begging you - please.
please.
pretty weird.
what?
it's like I never even busted it.
Yeah, same with the dresser.
and, in fact, everything has been cleaned up and put away.
the bed's made.
those metal shutters on the window - gone.
Yeah, all without a sound.
there's more than just the night manager
and those guys at the Chinese restaurant around here.
but where are they?
well, if I think about it too much, I'm just gonna go crazy, so...
you don't think that that's what they want, do you?
do you? - I don't know.
I mean, it doesn't make sense, but...
what has so far?
you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
I think the others are waiting for us.
enjoy, please.
all of you, enjoy.
fish is fresh. Delicious.
please, enjoy.
okay, what the hell was that out there?
uh... Most likely an A. D.S.
say what? - Active denial system.
it transmits high-intensity microwaves.
stimulates the water molecules in your skin.
it's the same technology they use to reheat a burrito at 7-eleven, except you're the burrito.
military deployed them in Iraq mostly for crowd control.
I mean, it won't kill you, but it delivers enough hurt
that it'll make you wish it did.
okay, so they've got these pain guns
covering all the exits out of town.
probably all around the perimeter of the town,
most likely positioned somewhere out on the edge of town.
well, that's that, then.
there's got to be a way to disarm it.
it's definitely beatable.
we need to do some recon first,
figure out how many there are and, more importantly, where they're located.
I still don't understand the why of it all.
why they're doing this to us?
I keep telling you - ransom.
it's the only reason to keep us alive.
or we're on some twisted reality show in Dubai or something.
these cameras around here
bunch of towel-heads are probably laughing their asses off right now,
watching the infidels screaming with pain.
I know why I'm here.
my father.
and who the hell is your father?
the U. S. Ambassador to Italy.
wait a minute.
why would your father want to kidnap us?
I said that's why I'm here.
the rest of you have to figure out who put you here for yourselves.
what could you have possibly done to make your father want to throw you into a town surrounded by face-melting pain guns?
things.
Well...I'll tell you what I think we should do.
I think we should go beat the crap out of the night manager
the second he comes on duty.
the point of that is what? - Because he's obviously one of 'em.
I couldn't agree more.
he seems to be the only one who knows more than we do.
and nothing like a couple of broken knuckles
to motivate cooperation.
we're not doing that. - The hell we're not.
there's no reason to do that.
he doesn't know any more than we do. He already told us that.
exactly. He told us.
the sergeant's right.
we need to figure out who we're dealing with first...
figure out this town.
I agree.
same here.
sergeant.
all right.
you take the eastern quadrant.
you two, the west.
you, the southern end of town, and I'll take the north.
check the buildings.
are there any basements?
are there any maps of the surrounding area?
anything that might give us a clue.
two hours, max.
we meet back here, put together what we know.
any questions?
uh, yeah.
what Rambo movie did you just pop out of?
I - I don't get it.
how do you guys come up with "child abandonment"?
you've got the surveillance tapes.
they're showing nothing that could be called even remotely conclusive.
no, no. By all accounts, this woman was a good, dedicated mother.
I mean, come on, Robert.
there's something bigger going on here.
what angle are you looking for, exactly?
alien abduction? - Funny.
you interviewed the grandmother, right? - Yes.
you didn't pick up anything odd there.
Really? - Oh, come on.
the grandmother is beyond scary.
there's no material connection Between the mother's disappearance and the grandmother.
can you at least see if there's something in the deep archives?
pretty busy here, but...
I'll see what I can do.
Hi. - Hi.
how's your day going? Can I get you anything?
that's okay.
latte, pedicure?
no, I-I think I'm good.
let me tell you why you're not good.
I have been patiently waiting for an update on the headless homeless story.
I'm on it. - No, you're not on it.
I know what you're doing. You're diddling around with this dead-end, go-nowhere missing-mom story.
there's something kind of weird about it all, Kat.
I know this routine.
this is where you try and convince me what a great story this is.
because it is.
and not just a great story, but a story with legs.
multiple front-page spreads weeks of 'em.
I don't know what's gotten into you, Renbe.
for five years, you've been the king of sick,
and I've loved you for it because you've made my job so easy.
stick with what you're good at.
leave the legitimate stories to the real journalists, okay?
I expect a 10-pound bag of steaming sleaze on my desk by the end of the day - no excuses.
a man after my own heart.
to hell with the grunt and his perimeter search.
my name's Blackham, by the way. Bill Blackham.
I don't know if I've properly introduced myself.
so, what's the plan, Mr. Morse?
Oh, I think you know, Mr. Blackham.
we wait for the night manager to show up, and then we
well, here's a pleasant surprise.
cognac, Mr. Blackham?
don't mind if I do.
Oh. Well...
here's to success.
and, uh...
freedom.
Amen to that, brother.
Amen to that.
come on.
soldier boy back there said we had to explore every building we could get into.
what's the difference if I grab something to wear?
so...
what, you're a doctor or something?
psychiatrist, actually.
but I did an E. R. Rotation in medical school.
huh. What do you think?
me? I don't know.
I 'm not really qualified in the fashion department.
it's a little retro.
Oh, what the hey.
Hey, they're watching, you know.
Yeah.
so?
I'm just saying.
here, you creepy pervs!
get your nads off on these!
come on, doc. Let's find you something to wear.
Moira. Call me Moira.
cool name. - Thanks.
that's depressing.
but manageable.
meaning it's not miles of ocean or barbed wire.
trees.
trees are...
well, trees.
Yeah, only with pain guns and god knows what else.
God has nothing to do with this place.
so, you believe in god?
I take it you don't?
you know you have a maddening way
of answering a question with another question?
are you aware of that?
I'm sorry. I - I don't mean to.
Yes.
I believe there's a god.
all I know is I'm not waiting around
for divine intervention to get out of here.
the only thing I know is, every second that I spend here,
my daughter's at risk.
Megan? Where are you?
in here, nana.
you look like you're having fun.
Oh, sweetheart, were you playing with nana's puzzle?
Yes, nana.
because I'm missing a few pieces.
and a jigsaw puzzle - it just isn't very good If it's missing pieces, is it?
no.
sweet pea, when you finish playing, come find nana,
and we'll grab a little talk
about respecting other people's property, all right?
okay.
every way out of town is covered by the pain guns.
no surprise there.
Yeah, we couldn't see anything from the balcony.
just lots of trees.
trees? - Yeah, for miles.
the A. D. S. Es are well-camouflaged, but they're definitely out there.
trust me.
I felt every one of 'em.
well, I guess we need to find an off switch.
or else come up with a plan "b.
I don't understand you people.
that man over there
he knows. - Totally.
now, we can bang our head against that pain wall all day,
but I guarantee you, with the right persuasion,
that bastard over there will lead us all the hell out of here.
excuse me.
I just wanted to mention that dinner will be served in one hour.
you might want to freshen up.
where is dinner tonight?
at the shanghai palace, right across the street.
not again. - Yes, sir.
well, I don't know about you guys,
but I am in desperate need of a spa day...
or at least a shower.
you going to dinner?
you? - Yeah.
I'll see you there. - See you there.
so, uh, Charlie, you want to go and get...
you will soon win some high prize or award.
yeah? - It's me Moira.
I'll be there in a sec.
Hi.
well, don't you look amazing?
Thanks.
aren't you coming to dinner?
I am.
but look at this.
just showed up in my room.
may I? - Sure.
Wow.
a vanessa cardui chrysalis.
the painted lady butterfly.
well, cocoon right now.
but you see the colors starting on the edges of the pupa?
it means she's ready to come out soon.
is it poisonous?
no, no, no. It's - it's quite common.
it's found all over the world.
you seem to know a lot about it.
Yeah, I like to read about different things.
did you put it in here?
did you sneak into my room and put this bug in here, Moira?
why would I?
how could I?
I suppose you couldn't.
it is just like my sick jerk of a father to torture me with a metaphor.
could you be any more obvious?!
no, no, no, no. No.
Please...Don't.
I don't want it in here. It creeps me out.
I'll take care of it.
please.
whatever.
Hello, gentlemen.
how may I be of assistance?
kill Joe and You'll go free
this is your answer?
this is what you want?
help me!
help me, please, somebody!
help me, please! Help me!
please, gentlemen!
Hey! We're getting pretty tired of your bull, bud!
now walk.
please. They'll kill me.
they don't care about me.
I'm just the same as you.
move it! Go!
Hey! Stand down!
you had your chance. We're handling this now.
help me, please.
Blackham, put the gun down.
eat me! - He's one of them.
I'm not. I swear.
they're not gonna fry one of their own.
they turn off the pain gun,
and we rush out right behind him.
it won't work! - The hell it won't!
they're watching us all the time!
you think if he was one of them, they wouldn't have intervened by now?
especially since you guys have been beating the living crap out of him.
he's our ticket out of here.
there's nothing you can do that's gonna stop us from pushing him over
okay.
okay, okay.
I'm sorry about all this.
what? Where's he going?!
I knew it!
did you see that?!
Ah. Sorry.
this will take the sting out.
Oh, no.
too early. - Not for me.
Hey, hey!
so what's your plan now, mastermind,
now that you've messed up our last best chance at escaping this hellhole?
he's right.
damn it.
maybe.
think we should have tortured this guy till he cracked?
even if he was one of them, torture wouldn't have worked.
never does. - Yeah, I agree.
but if we planned it a little more carefully,
we might have had a shot of at least one of us escaping.
what do they say
hindsight has 20/20 vision?
something like that, I guess.
the trick is to stay alert, stay frosty.
is that it, sergeant?
and pray to the god of your choice for guidance, sir.
that's easier said than done.
you're not trying hard enough, if you don't mind me saying.
daddy, I know the truth.
we'll talk about this later, shall we?
I know the truth.
you're gonna pay.
he's really a very nice man if you don't get to know him.
it's open.
Hey.
are you okay?
I feel like I have a hangover,
but I haven't had a drop to drink since we got here.
you think maybe that Chinese food is loaded with something?
I think you might be suffering from depression.
it's a pretty stressful situation for all of us.
that's an understatement.
I want to show you something.
I think it might cheer you up.
okay.
look.
isn't she amazing?
Yeah.
Yeah, it kind of is.
I think we should set her free.
I think that would be very therapeutic for both of us.
spoken like a true shrink.
Yeah, well...
I'd like to do that, Moira.
I really would.
me too.
I have a nice pension waiting for me in two years.
I don't know why I risk it for the likes of you.
because you're my friend?
we're anything but friends, Renbe.
well, then, it must be because you owe me.
God, I hate you.
what do you got?
some ugly stuff in there, Mark.
real ugly. - About Janet Cooper?
well, not so much about her, but what happened to her.
most of it is juvie, and only a court order from Moses himself
will ever get that information unsealed.
but there's enough other stuff to get the point across.
like? Read it for yourself.
tell you one thing, though. This lady has been through the wringer.
know about her husband?
husband? No.
ex-husband. Not sure which.
true piece of work.
took off and left her while she was pregnant with the kid.
total scumbag if you ask me.
I'd love to put a 10-year collar on him.
I'll take that, thank you very much.
who the hell are you?
no one you really want to know.
now give me the envelope. Please.
go screw yourself.
and I asked you so nice, too.
there's no respect for civility these days.
now, I've got about enough patience to ask you one more time.
give me the envelope.
Attaboy.
what's the big deal?
let's just say I have a client who'd stop at nothing
to make sure that none of this information gets into that filthy rag of yours.
like Janet Cooper's mother.
now, you see, Mr. Renbe,
it's questions like that that are gonna be the death of you.
you know, Tori found a chrysalis in her room.
in a jar.
a what? - A chrysalis.
I don't know. - Pupa.
I don't know. - Cocoon.
it just showed up, like magic.
Really? Just showed up?
was next to that damn fortune I got the other night.
you will soon win a high prize or award.
anyone else just have something show up in their room?
no, nothing.
no.
of course not.
it's just my father messing with me.
so, you think this is all about you, don't you?
pretty much, yeah.
what was that?!
what the hell was that?!
I think it's the pain gun!
at least, the explosion came from where the pain gun should be.
what are you saying - the lightning took it out?
looks that way.
what are we waiting for, then?
Hey, where are you going?!
let me go! - Where are you going?!
the van.
we should take the van. - How do we get the keys?
I can hot-wire it.
Hello? Used-car salesman.
we don't have much time.
they'll figure out the A. D. S. is down.
we don't know how many more are out there.
all right, we need to create a distraction.
I can do that.
okay, let's go! Go! Go, go, go!
come on, hurry up!
Ah... You want something?
I will help you! We can help you!
please!
I want to help you. Okay, please stop.
we can do something to help you.
okay, got it!
wait, stop! No damn way, sister.
moira's in the restaurant! You have to!
Hey, just do it. - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
hurry up!
come on! - Let's go, let's go, let's go!
go, go, go!

Hey, smoke detector.
those magnets should shut off if there's an alarm.

I'm saying if we start a fire in here, We should be able to get out.
but if the doors don't open, then we're stuck in here.
I'm not talking about setting the building on fire.

Hey, no offense, but I don't know who you people are.
we're all sitting around wondering where the bad guy is.
how do you know the bad guy's not right here?
he's right. Any one of us could be one of them.
but Joe's the only one I don't know anything about.
now, come on. Everybody is worth something to someone.
what makes you so sure that this is about money? I mean, I have no money, no family.
I'm not worth anything to anyone.
life insurance, maybe? - None.

I heard you walk past my room.
Oh, was that you screaming for help? You mean you just left her there?
Hey, look, no hard feelings.
enough. Come on, enough.
let him go.
what do we do with this guy?
does it really matter? - He could be one of them.

you can all stand around, trying to figure out who's who.
but I'm getting out of here.
now, who's with me?
I am.
who else?
begging your pardon, sir. - What?
we don't know what's out there.
so, what, we just stand here? - All I'm saying is, exercise caution.
wait until dark. I'll take the gun and do a recon.
supposing you get capped out there in the dark?
I'm willing to take that risk.
well, that's your job, isn't it? But then you'll be dead out there with the one weapon we have.
if that's how you feel - I'm not waiting for dark.
I'm going home right now.
you can stay here and watch the others.
who put the grunt in charge? - You did.
if I'm not back by tomorrow, do your recon.
I'll be back - with help.
no, no, no, no, no. Please don't go.
don't go. Don't go. Don't go.
I have to. My daughter, she
maybe moira's right.
supposing something happens to you out there. What then?
don't. Don't. - I'm going.
I have to go.
were you in the military, Joe?
me? You kidding?
Where'd you get an idea like that? - Things you say.
things you seem to know, Like the way you signaled to that marine back there.
what line of work is that?
what's your name? - Janet.
Janet, you know, your daughter is probably perfectly fine.
my daughter is 5, okay? She has allergies and a special diet.
Yeah, and if something happens to you out here
she's not safe, okay? So I've got to get home.
okay, okay, but if something does happen to you, You have family, right?
someone to take care of.
what about you, Joe? I mean, your life sure can't seem to wait.
who's waiting for you back home? - Nobody.
no one? - That's right.
no friends, no family, no girlfriend?
nothing that can't wait.
Joe? Joe, can you hear me?
what happened?
stay here, stay here.
where are you going?
sir! - No!
come on! Come on! Hold on!
just give it a minute!
we can't just let them lie out there.
nobody's getting left behind, but there's a way to do this.
trust me. This is what I do.
okay. Okay.
were they shot? Do you think they were shot?
I didn't hear anything.
I don't see any blood.
there would be a lot of blood.
Hey, let me go with you.
you watch me.
only me.
if I'm hit, you need to figure out where it came from.
okay.
Charlie, come on. - Damn it.
this obviously is not working.
come on. Let's go. We got to go back. Go.
they might have been shot!
get in here! Get in here! Let's go in here.
can you recall the last time you saw your daughter?
not for some time.
we've both been very busy.
she had her daycare, and I had my...
to be perfectly truthful,
my daughter and I were not speaking to one another.
that is to say, she was not speaking to me.
until recently, I was cut out of her life completely.
I never even met her husband.
she felt that Megan ought to know her grandmother, even...
she never felt I was a good parent.
the word she used was "abusive.
but I never hit her.
one time.
I hit her with a hairbrush until it broke.
my daughter and I were...
Nana! - Yes?
I found this in your room. Is this yours?
no.
no, she isn't mine.
then whose is it? - Well, she used to be mine.
but now she's yours, angel.
thank you, Nana.
I can't wait when mommy gets home so I can show her.
Yes, I am sure she will be thrilled.
now, take Dolly upstairs and play.
I have to keep talking to Mr. Renbe.
go on. Go on.
if there is a silver lining to this, It's that I've been given a second chance.
a chance to be the parent I supposedly never was.
well, it is indeed a blessing.
thank you very much for your time, ma'am.
and don't worry about your daughter.
I'm sure she'll turn up in no time.
Oh, I'm quite sure it will all end well.
general store is empty.
what about them? - They're just lying there.
what are you - Are you an idiot? It could be them!
it could be the cops. It could be someone driving by.
Yeah, the only someone ever.
you got to be kidding me.
Oh, my God.
put your hands up.
put your hands up.
okay. Okay. Okay.
thank you. Okay.

where you going? - What happened?
I - I don't know. I blinked my eyes, and I woke up in that van.

if I'm right, they're implants.
biometric implants.
they're used for administering medicine Over extended periods of time,
and they can be operated remotely.
Oh, that's fantastic.
I'm guessing we're all carrying a load of tranquilizer around.
you walk past a certain point out there, You trigger the implant - lights out.
you know a lot about this stuff.
medication is my life.
can you get them out? - They feel pretty deep.
