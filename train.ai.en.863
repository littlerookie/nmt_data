let's not talk about her. -Yeah, you wanna--? Lose that tie.
lose the tie and the scarf. The whole outfit.
for what? -Come on, take it off.
psychedelic time. Psychedelic time.
I smell a Fineman jam session coming on.
Yeah, Burrows Hall-style. Burrows Hall.
jamming and jamming and jamming.
here. -I don't play guitar, Charlie.
Hey, Johnson, you're barely a dentist.
you pull people's teeth all day. It don't matter.
come on. Come on. All right. Get that in you. Get that in you.
let me do this. -You'll get to this. Come on.
let me hear some of that.
I don't know how to play this,
Charlie Fineman!
alan Johnson. Alan Johnson! -Charlie Fineman!
good night, Jersey!
Philadelphia. Philadelphia! -Good night, Philly!
baby, I'm sorry. I messed up, but you know I don't ever do anything like that.
I just didn't wanna call you and wake you up.
I was stuck in Charlie world. I couldn't...
...leave.
this is not okay.
you staying out all night...
...It's not acceptable.
I'm just saying, the guy's in a lot of pain.
it's sad over there, baby. It's just
just a sea of sadness.
Yeah. -Hi. Charlie Fineman for Dr. Johnson.
you don't have an appointment, sir? -Oh, we're friends.
what--? -We were college roommates.
And? -I used to sleep in the nude.
Charlie? -All right, come in.
I hear " Colossus."
Hey.
Hey, hey, buddy. Take the shoes off. I told you.
I told you.
Hey, didn't you just...?
all right. All right.
Hey, let me try it.
hang on.
let me try it. -Just watch me do it first.
let me just try it.
okay, how do you shoot it? -Square is to stab him.
that's the bird. You wanna shoot him, get his attention.
all right. All right, get your arrow ready.
and let me pluck him right in the uterus.
aim what?
Oh, fuck.
I could show you how to do it, give you some hints...
...but I'll warn you, it's very addictive.
well, I don't have an addictive personality...
...so just show me how to do it.
is something I said funny?
all right.
that'll call your horse. The triangle is how you jump...
okay, okay, very good.
stab his arm. -I'm stabbing him in the arm.
no, you gotta stab in the right spot. -I'm stabbing it right there.
you gotta be on the light.
shit. -That's not gonna work.
I gotta climb this big son of a bitch
look, just put it down, all right? Rest.
next time you come, you'll be better. Let it soak in.
no, no, no. Right now. No next. Now.
I thought you don't have an addictive personality.
that was the line of the night, man.
you're an addict.
say it, man. Say you're an addict. -Yeah, okay. I'm an addict. All right.
come on, now, stab his wing. -Oh, God.
Oh, I'm on your ass, bird. -Stab his wing. All right. Yeah.
colossus!
that's the first three...
okay, now, wait. You said they get bigger too?
well, no, it's different.
it's like you're gonna use a bow and arrow more.
each one will have different powers. -What are we doing?
wait a minute, Charlie, you said get a burger, man. I can't
I can't do this. I gotta work in the morning.
Yeah, so you'll work, you'll be tired. So what?
this is like a marathon, man. It'll go till 5 in the morning. I can't
you'll go to sleep tomorrow night at 8: 00 instead of 10: 30.
how's that? Is that enough sleep, you faggot?
Hey, don't call me faggot.
are you a faggot? -Quit saying faggot.
just don't say faggot.
don't just call people faggot. That's rude.
to a gay guy it is. To you, it's just...
...a funny word, like pound cake or pickle.
you're a fucked-up dude, man.
I'm a fucked-up dude? Okay.
you really need some Mel.
you need some Mel.
I'll take one adult and one faggot.
come on, you really need to come in here.
Johnson.
Johnson. -Okay.
good decision.
Hey! The sheriff is a nig
what did he say? -The sheriff is near,
no,
the sheriff is a nig
I ain't got no body
and nobody cares for me
he's out of his mind.
richard Pryor, he did his own thing. -They both did great, obviously...
...but I can only imagine, if they would have done another one?
Janeane's called 1 5 times.
Hello? -Hey, baby.
where have you been? I've been calling you for the last three hours.
I know. I'm sorry. I had the phone off. I was in this Mel Brooks marathon.
I've never laughed so hard. I gotta bring you down here.
this thing is crazy. -Alan, I need you to listen to me.
your father's died.
what? -And I've been trying to reach you
what did you just say? -Your mother called here, a couple hours after you left,
he died in his sleep, in his bed...
...and Mom's here with us now and she's very upset and she needs you.
wait a minute, wait a minute. He's dead?
I'm sorry, baby.
where are the girls? -They're with Mom on the couch.
they're fine.
I'll be home as soon as I can. -Will you please hurry up?
Yeah, I will.
everything cool?
my dad just died.
died, like...
...dead? -Yeah.
you wanna go get some breakfast?
Charlie, my father just died.
Yeah. There's a store that's gonna open up soon.
sells kitchen counters. I wanna take you there.
they got marble tops. -Charlie, my father just died.
Yeah, yeah, I know. I wanna hang, though.
come on. Let's not waste all this Mel.
we just got a good dose of Mel.
are we hanging?
no.
we're not hanging.
Oh, hey, let's get some Chinese. Come on, don't be such a pussy.
all right, does everybody see what it is?
here it is. At the bottom. See? Good look.
come on. What do you think?
Yeah. -Johnson?
Yep. -I'm Sugarman.
Bryan Sugarman? Did I catch you at a bad time?
well, I just came back from burying my father, but other than that
cool. Let me just say up front, Alan...
...I make it my business to watch this guy's back.
that's what I do. I look out for him. -Okay.
now, obviously, I can't stop him from doing this without going down a very dangerous legal road.
but rest assured, I'll do anything short of that...
...to not give you a million dollars.
I don't know what you're talking about.
he wants me to give you a million dollars.
he has that kind of money?
that's none of your business. That's my business. It's what I do.
we've already established that. I won't let him be manipulated.
Sugarman, calm down, okay?
I don't want his million dollars.
tell him I'm not mad at him and we're still friends, okay? Just tell him that.
you're being straight? -Yes.
I don't need his million dollars, okay? Just tell him that.
okay. I like that.
okay, good, then I've done my job.
Yeah. Good job.
come on in and have some food.
go ahead.
daddy, your friend is here.
the one who acts like he's younger than JoJo.
Charlie Fineman?
honey, don't be like that, okay?
don't judge people. That's not polite.
Hey.
I'm sorry about your dad.
Thanks.
I behaved badly that night. I know I did.
all right? I'm sorry.
and you wanted to give me a million dollars to make up for it?
I don't have any friends other than you, Johnson.
I got you something.
the River, -Absolutely.
and Quadrophenia, -Yeah.
another album you used to torture me with.
Quadrophenia changed my life, Johnson.
that's a nice gift.
too late to go for the million?
Hey, are you hungry? -Yeah.
wanna get some breakfast? -Yeah.
come on. -All right.
just me and you here?
Hey, everybody...
...this is Charlie. Charlie...
...this is everybody. Come on in.
these guys are staying?
Yeah, Charlie. Everybody's staying.
Charlie Fineman for Dr. Johnson. We're having lunch today.
we're having Chinese.
I can't tell you how happy that makes me.
the last time you were in a dental office, anyway?
need to schedule you for a cleaning?
come on. Let's go get something to eat.
you miss it?
miss what?
nothing. Forget it. -What? What? Come on.
Charlie, nothing, all right? Forget it.
no, what do you think I missed, being a dentist?
do you?
Why?
why what? -Why are you asking me?
are you trying to focus me?
is that it? Did they send you here to focus me?
Yeah, you got me. That's it. I'm with the CIA...
...and this is Operation Focus Fineman.
are you kidding me? -Better not be.
Charlie, if we're gonna be friends, you have to be able to trust me.
thought we were friends. -We are friends.
that's why I can't pretend I don't know anything about you.
is that a threat, though, to not be friends?
no. I'm saying friends talk about what's going on in their lives.
you're an asshole.
Charlie-- Hey, Charlie!
what the fuck is wrong with you?
get out of here, man!
Charlie, get the f
okay, okay. Get out of here. Get out of here.
leave me alone! All right?
Charlie, get out of here!
Yeah. All right.
shut your mouth.
what are you still doing in here? I told you to leave.
because this isn't your office. I left! This is public property.
this isn't close to public property. -Yes, it is!
get out of here, man! -I'll call the police if you don't leave.
it's okay. Let me handle it. -No, it's not! He's
Melanie, shut the damn window!
Jesus.
we can't keep doing this shit, Charlie.
look, I don't know what I said to you in there that got you so pissed off...
...but I'm sorry, Charlie, all right?
all right.
Jesus. -I know.
Dr. Johnson. -Miss Remar.
is everything okay? -Oh, yeah. Everything's good.
I have an appointment scheduled. -Just check in with Melanie.
maybe I should come back. -No, no, it's fine. Just check in.
check in with Melanie.
the one who--?
doctor will see you in the office.
that gorgeous girl wants to blow you?
Charlie, come on. -She wants to blow you?
look, get out-- -Come here.
are you crazy? Get out of here.
she's gorgeous. -Yeah, I know.
way you were talking about-- Thought she was a beast or something.
I gotta straighten this out. -All right, but how hot is that girl?
she's fine. She's hot. -She's the hottest.
is she not the hottest? -Charlie, will you get out--?
let me go in for you. Let me get the blowjob.
let me see that woman. -Oh, you're playful now? Get out.
stop it! Get out of here!
did you smell that? She even smells good!
Jesus.
I wanna know what is going on. -Nothing is going on.
don't tell me nothing's going on. -Calm down.
let me explain it, okay? -All right, explain it.
she's like out of a 1940s movie.
did you see that girl?
I mean, that was just perfection.
you okay?
"okay"?
no, I wouldn't use that word.
well, thank you for seeing me.
did I have a choice, Miss Remar? I mean...
you've really put me in a terrible position here at my office.
can we just cut to it? I don't wanna take a lot of your time.
Yeah.
this letter...
...that you sent my
I can do this quick.
wait a-- No, no.
please.
recently, I've come through a rotten divorce.
I was married for 10 years.
my husband was having an affair for five of them.
they had another life here in the city.
he had two lives.
I was walking down the street one day and I saw them.
and I followed them, and it was truly like a dream.
I spoke to a neighbour and she talked about them...
...as if they were the Joneses living next door all these years.
and in that moment, I lost my equilibrium.
and I fell, right there on the sidewalk.
and the thing is, Dr. Johnson, I haven't yet gotten up.
now, my behaviour towards you is inexcusable, I know that.
I behaved in a way I don't normally behave.
what I've done by even threatening a lawsuit is so repulsive to me.
I even lied to you when I told you that my therapist had told me to act on my thoughts.
I wanted to come in and see you and tell you that I am so sorry.
and that I am very embarrassed.
and that you won't be having any more trouble from me.
I promise that to you. -Okay.
okay.
he's got a poison capsule.
don't bite down, you son of a bitch.
who sent you? I want a name.
give me a name!
suicide pill.
potassium cyanide. Guy was dead before he hit the ground.
Thanks, hon.
then Rorschach was right.
this wasn't some lone nut.
it's an organization: Well-funded, well-equipped.
but who'd wanna kill us now?
I don't know, but it's not safe out here.
so no word from Jon?
no.
well, listen...
...why don't you come stay with me?
Oh, no. That's sweet, but I wouldn't wanna impose.
Oh, no. No. Think of it as doing me a favor.
I wouldn't have to worry about you being out there.
okay.
Rorschach's journal, October 21 st, 1985.
on 43rd and 7th, saw Dreiberg and Jupiter leaving diner.
they didn't know me without my mask.
an affair?
did she break Manhattan's heart to engineer his exile...
...make room for Dreiberg?
does Manhattan even have a heart to break?
the alley was cold, deserted.
my things were where I left them, waiting for me.
my coat, my shoes, my spotless gloves.
my face.
putting them on, I abandoned my disguise...
...became myself.
free from fear or weakness...
...or lust.
down alley...
...heard woman scream.
first bubbling note of city's evening chorus.
attempted rape.
mugging.
both.
the man turned...
...and there was something rewarding in his eyes.
sometimes the night is generous to me.
Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife named Roy Chess.
at his apartment, I found clues.
seems he worked at Pyramid Transnational.
I've seen the logo before...
...at Moloch's.
someone tried to shoot the world's smartest man today, Moloch.
guy worked for Pyramid Transnational.
more than a just delivery service, I take it.
last time I was here,
I saw a pension check written from the same company.
I'm guessing it's a front set up by whoever wants us masks dead.
now, no more lies, Moloch. Who runs Pyramid?
Rorschach.
this is the police. We know you're in there.
no. No!
if there's anybody in there with you, send them out unharmed.
no. No, no, no!
framed. Walked right into it. Stupid, stupid, stupid!
never, never surrender.
all right. I hope you're ready, hero.
when you are.
one...
...two...
...three.
come on.
son of a bitch.
Christ, he stinks. Get that mask off him.
I got it. No. No!
my face! Give me back my face!
the masked vigilante Rorschach was apprehended...
...and identified as walter Kovacs, a 35-year-old white male.
little's known about Kovacs, but he was charged with the murder...
...of Edgar Jacobi, found shot in the head in his home in the Bronx.
police officers were injured and Jacobi's home was set ablaze...
...during the violent course of the capture.
Rorschach!
I'm gonna fuck you like I fucked your mother!
come on out, Rorschach!
Walter Kovacs.
is that your name? Walter?
well, let me explain your situation here, Walter.
you cooperate with me...
...and I may be able to convince them that you should be treated medically.
in a hospital. I believe that would be good for you.
but the authorities wanna put you with the general population.
prison's a prison. Uh-huh. Yes.
but the difference is, down there...
...you'd be eaten alive.
you're responsible for a lot of them being in prison here, Walter.
tell me what you see.
a pretty butterfly.
what about now? What do you see here?
mom?
is he hurting you?
you got a fucking kid in here. I get that at home.
bastard. I should have had that abortion.
some nice flowers.
I heard this guy's mom's a whore.
did you catch any diseases from her?
huh? Whoreson. Listen to me, retard.
Hey, you think she'd suck my dick for a dollar?
clouds.
tell me about Rorschach. Will you do that, Walter?
you keep calling me Walter. I don't like you.
you don't like me. All right, why is that, exactly?
you're fat.
wealthy. Liberal sensibilities.
what you call compassion.
wanting to protect and understand the guilty.
this rotting society, what it calls rehabilitation.
nothing short of compromise.
is it a compromise to want to make you well?
there are other men in here with behavior more extreme than mine, doctor.
of course, they're not famous, are they?
you wanna know about Rorschach?
I'll tell you about Rorschach.
once a man has seen society's black underbelly...
...he can never turn his back on it.
never pretend, like you do...
...that it doesn't exist, no matter who orders him to look the other way.
we don't do this thing...
...because it's permitted.
we do it because we have to.
we do it because we're compelled.
I was investigating a kidnap case.
blaire Roche.
six-year-old girl. I was young then.
too soft on criminals.
I let them live.
broke a man's arm to get a tip.
led me to the missing girl's location.
I knew the girl was here...
...but when I searched the place, I saw nothing.
and then I found her.
Fred.
Barney.
who's gonna bark for Daddy?
it was dark when the murderer got back.
as dark as it gets.
Oh, God. Who's out there? Who is it?
who is it?
what? What the fuck? Who the fuck are you?
what the fuck do you want? You killed my dogs, man!
you think I had something to do with that girl? I found that.
what evidence have you got? That's nothing.
okay. I confess.
I kidnapped her. I killed her.
arrest me.
what? Arrest me!
I did it! I said I did it!
Christ.
look, I've got a problem, man. Fucking take me in. I need help.
no, don't. Don't do that. Take me in. Don't! No!
men get arrested.
dogs get put down.
tremors of impact shook my arm.
warm blood splashed my face.
whatever was left of Walter Kovacs died that night with that little girl.
from then on, there was only Rorschach.
see, doctor, God didn't kill that little girl.
fate didn't butcher her and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs.
if God saw what any of us did that night, he didn't seem to mind.
from then on, I knew:
God doesn't make the world this way.
we do.
I can't help him.
Hey, Rorschach.
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?
rorschach, I heard your mother was a whore.
Hey, you know what? I'm pretty famous too.
ain't that right? That's right. That's right.
maybe I can give you an autograph. What you say, big boy?
none of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you.
all right, that's it!
you're locked in here with me.
Laurie!
shit.
hold on. Fuck.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
I'm so sorry. I was snooping around and must have hit the wrong button.
are you hurt? No, no.
okay. I'm fine. I just feel so bad.
no, don't worry.
it's happened before. Comedian did it back in '77.
Archie survived that.
Archie?
Oh. Well, uh, short for Archimedes...
...Merlin's pet owl.
stupid nickname.
how did you ever afford all this stuff, anyway?
well, my dad was in corporate banking and left me a lot of money when he died...
...which always surprised me. I mean, he was...
I think he was disappointed I went into crime fighting...
...instead of following him.
guess I was just more interested in birds and airplanes, mythology and...
Plus, there were enough other guys doing this so that I didn't feel ridiculous.
like Hollis.
Yeah.
Yeah, he was my hero.
man, I remember the first time that I met him...
...I just felt so connected, you know?
to something that mattered.
must be nice having a secret identity.
a secret place that nobody knows about.
you can just come down here and hang out without anyone checking up on you.
nobody watching you.
wanna try those on?
there we go.
wow, these rock.
they amplify the spectral range.
thermal imaging.
they work even better in the dark.
you can see me, right?
I can see everything.
I remember, no matter how black it got...
...whenever I looked through those goggles, everything was as clear as day.
this must be the way Jon sees the world.
we should probably head up. Food's getting cold.
put those away when you're done.
soviet ambassador to the U. N. had no comment...
...when asked if Dr. Manhattan's disappearance...
...has fueled Soviet aggression in Afghanistan.
Dan.
jon sees a lot of things...
...but he doesn't see me.
well, uh...
Oh.
sorry.
come here.
what's the matter?
Laurie if you could just move a little... Okay.
Yeah. There you go.
Dan, what's wrong?
sorry, I...
Yeah, I just need a couple minutes.
Oh, hell.
it's okay.
maybe we were just moving too fast.
we've got all the time in the world.
we'll take it slow.
it's been a long time, Rorschach.
big Figure.
small world.
I like that.
but you know, it is a small world in here.
and I've been in it for, how long now, Lloyd?
almost 15 years, Mr. Figure.
that's right.
fifteen years since you and that Owl fella put me away.
so...
...Rorschach, that guy you burned is dying.
could go any minute.
you know, by my count, there are more than 50 people in here that you put away.
I been talking to every one of them and they're all dying to get a piece of you.
this place is gonna explode!
then, you die by inches.
tall order.
I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole.
relax, Lawrence. Soon.
come on.
Dan?
is everything all right?
I'm tired of being afraid.
afraid of war...
...afraid of the mask killer...
...and afraid of this goddamn suit...
...and how much I need it.
me too.
so to hell with it.
let's take Archie out.
you're serious.
I used to be a masked avenger too, remember?
I'm used to going out at 3 in the morning and doing something stupid.
rapid burner. Be advised, all units.
tenement fire at 5th and Grand. Rapid burner.
let's go.
I can see it. All right, hold on.
Dan, there are kids in there.
everyone, stay where you are and remain calm.
we're gonna get you out of there.
the roof's starting to cave. Get me in there.
I'm gonna get you close.
let's go.
come on.
all right, let's move it, people.
mom, is that guy in the space rocket?
is that Jesus?
no, baby.
watch your step. All right.
we're all set.
is that everyone?
Bye. Bye!
I can't believe we did that.
they'll lock us up with Rorschach. Who cares?
world War llI could start tomorrow.
right?
right.
come back here!
he's dead, Rorschach.
while everyone's distracted, we thought we'd bring you a housewarming gift.
something from the machine shop.
Hey, boss, you notice?
none of that "small world, tall order" crap.
he knows once we slice open his lock, he's next on the block.
fat chance.
you're dead, Rorschach!
we got a prison full of killers out here. What do you got?
your hands, my pleasure.
can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars?
this riot won't last. I been waiting 15 years for this.
I'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're in the way of my revenge.
nothing personal, big guy.
boss! Wait!
now you find out what the score is.
One-nothing. Come and get me.
come on.
so I've been thinking.
I feel that we have an obligation to our fraternity.
I think we ought to spring Rorschach. What?
someone set him up.
and this whole cancer thing with Jon, it just doesn't make sense.
you didn't get it.
Yeah, but breaking into a maximum-security prison...
...is a little different than putting out a fire.
Yeah, you're right.
it'll be more fun.
hurry, Lloyd. I wanna smell this son of a bitch cooking.
Yes.
no.
never disposed of sewage with a toilet before. Obvious, really.
Two-nothing. Your move.
get out of the way!
how do we know he's still alive? He's alive
Where's my face?
don't kill me.
your turn, doctor.
tell me, what do you see?
don't move!
Rorschach.
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.
excuse me. Have to visit men's room.
Oh, for chrissake.
good to see you in uniform, Daniel.
should've known all you needed was nice pair of legs to motivate you.
you're such an asshole, Rorschach. Spare me indignation.
picked hell of a time to be unfaithful to Jon.
get tired of being patriotic, or someone put you up to it?
you don't know what the fuck you're talking about!
Hey! Would you two stop? You can argue later.
I had to turn the screechers off, so we'll be drawing fire soon.
stop! Stop or we will shoot!
are you all right?
Yeah. Just...
...heavy, you know?
war, jailbreak.
don't worry about it. Okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
Hello, Laurie. Jon.
TV said you were on Mars. I am on Mars.
you and I are about to have a conversation there.
what are you talking about?
you're going to try to convince me to save the world.
Laurie, don't. Dan, trust me.
I have to go.
beautiful, isn't it?
forgive me. These things sometimes slip my mind.
it won't happen again.
that's comforting.
Oh, my God.
I'm on Mars.
Hey. Nice ass. Hey, asshole.
Hey, let's see if that comic-book retard's up here.
Hey, hey, hey. Yo.
you all hear?
some super-owl dude just busted Rorschach out of prison.
Rorschach? Yeah.
that fool put my cousin in a wheelchair.
you mean Nite Owl.
him and Rorschach used to be partners, remember?
Yeah. Maybe he messed your cousin up too.
didn't he write a book or something? Yeah.
you know, he lives over a garage right near here.
yeah? Does he, now?
Hello?
Sally?
Hollis? Yeah.
Yes, Hollis Mason. Jesus.
all this time you've had my number and you wait until our sunset years to use it?
well, it seemed like a special occasion, Sal.
what?
the TV is reporting there was a tenement fire last night.
there were trapped people rescued by airship...
...and they say the pilot was dressed like an owl.
and it seems he had a sexy woman with him.
Laurie? My daughter, Laurie?
I can't get over Laurie back in costume.
maybe she'll finally thank me for getting her started in the first place.
you know, Sal, by the sound of your voice...
...you're sounding younger than ever.
Oh. Why, bless you, Hollis.
but that's probably just senility.
well, it's been great talking to you, Sal...
...but someone's knocking.
well, don't get too misty-eyed thinking about old times.
you take care now, Hollis.
Ah, you too.
Bye.
Bye.
we're looking for Mr. Owl.
Yeah. Hold your horses.
Mr. Owl, you there?
trick or treat.
you should've stayed retired, Owl.
I hate this.
cowering in cave, hiding from authorities.
cops are out there hunting us.
unless you wanna go back to prison...
...we'd be stupid to expose ourselves without a plan.
and what would that be?
once we've established a pattern...
...we can break into Pyramid, see what we find.
did that. Dead end.
I think it's a front company for whoever's really behind it, but can't prove it.
we need to hit up underworld contacts, squeeze people.
sure, why don't we just pick names out of a phone book?
you forgot how we do things, Daniel.
you've gone too soft. Too trusting. Especially with women.
okay, no. Listen, I've had it with that.
God, who do you think you are, Rorschach?
you live off people while insulting them...
...and no one complains because they think you're a goddamn lunatic.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that, man.
Daniel...
...you are a good friend.
I know it can be difficult with me sometimes.
forget it.
it's okay, man.
let's do it your way.
Oh, God.
pyramid Transnational. Anyone heard of it?
Oh, you bastards.
I buy everyone a round and you sell me out like this?
back off, or I'll stick this glass in your squidgy face.
everybody stay calm. We'll try to keep this brief.
Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll.
tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Dead now. Did you know him?
no.
Yeah, yeah!
I hired him. I knew him from the inside.
you're a felon.
I was. I've been straight ever since I got out, I swear.
I barely knew Chess that well, but I was told to hire from the old life.
told by whom? My contact, Miss Slater.
Janey Slater works for Pyramid too?
Yeah, she was real nice.
she said hiring ex-cons was part of the company program.
give people a second chance.
God, please let go! I'm telling the truth!
Janey Slater, Manhattan's old girlfriend.
Adrian might help us find out who's underwriting Pyramid.
follow the money.
former member of the Minutemen Hollis Mason found murdered...
...in his apartment less than an hour ago.
witnesses reported seeing members of a local gang known as the Knot-Tops...
...leaving the area right around the estimated time of death.
reporting live, Tiffany Burns...
who did it? I knew you were gonna victimize me, man.
what about my civil rights? Just because I'm wearing...
tell me who did it! A lot of people dress like this.
who murdered Hollis Mason?
you tell your friends they're dead.
I'm gonna take out this entire rathole neighborhood.
I'll break your neck!
Daniel, not in front of the civilians.
Oh, goddamn. Goddamn, Hollis.
this is where we hold our conversation.
in it, you reveal to me that you and Dreiberg have been sleeping together.
you know about me and Dan? Not yet.
but in a few moments you're going to tell me.
if you already know the future, then why were you surprised when I left you?
or when that reporter ambushed you?
why even argue about it if you already know how this is gonna end?
I have no choice.
everything is preordained.
even my responses.
and you're just going through the motions.
the most powerful thing in the universe is still just a puppet.
we are all puppets, Laurie.
I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.
and what if you're wrong?
why does my perception of time distress you so?
because it's inhuman.
because it makes me insane.
you always say you wanna comfort me. Well, it isn't working.
look, I don't wanna fight.
I'm sorry I slept with Dan.
you slept with Dan?
you just said that you already knew about that.
I said often...
...that you were my only remaining link to humanity.
why would I save a world...
...I no longer have any stake in?
then do it for me.
if you really care.
when you left me, I left Earth.
does that not show you that I care?
my red world here, now...
...means more to me than your blue one.
let me show you.
bombers are fueled and ready, sir.
it's time, gentlemen.
take us to DEFCON one.
not in penthouse. Not in office.
what nocturnal proclivities entice a man with everything...
...out into the night at this hour?
Daniel?
you with me?
Yeah. Then what are you doing?
I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.
maybe he keeps on file.
something's not right. Agreed.
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess all work for Pyramid.
Moloch said the Comedian mentioned list with his and Slater's name on it.
whoever owns Pyramid could be giving these people cancer.
setting Manhattan up.
funny.
ancient pharaohs looked forward to the end of the world.
believed cadavers would rise, reclaim hearts from golden jars.
must currently be holding breath in anticipation.
Pharaohs?
got a psych profile on Manhattan.
see what the corporate head-peepers say.
subject continues to retreat emotionally.
rameses II
if the only remaining ties were to be severed...
...we predict total detachment from the human condition.
I'm in.
no.
congratulations, Mr. Veidt.
Dr. Manhattan's energy reactor is online.
your support and your enthusiasm...
...is what has led to this triumph.
on behalf of the research team, we salute you.
Cheers. Cheers.
what in life does not deserve celebrating?
this is the new Karnak.
this represents the culmination of a dream more than 2000 years old...
...a dream now assured because of your unquestioning assistance.
and for this...
...I am ashamed...
...ashamed that you must now share such inadequate a reward.
to the pharaohs...
...their greatest secrets entrusted to their servants...
...buried alive with them in sand-floored chambers.
sleep well, gentlemen.
our new, peaceful world will be indebted...
...to your great sacrifice.
Bubastis.
Rorschach's journal. Final entry.
Veidt's behind everything.
Why?
what's his endgame?
I cannot imagine a more dangerous opponent.
used to joke he was fast enough to catch a bullet.
he could kill us both alone in the snow.
that's where we're going now: Antarctica.
whether I'm alive or dead upon this reading...
...I hope the world survives long enough for this journal to reach you.
I live my life free of compromise...
...and step into the shadow without complaint or regret.
rorschach, November 1 st.
can't you just tell me how this ends and save us the trouble?
it ends with you in tears.
tears? So you don't come back to Earth.
at some point, yes.
the streets are filled with death.
Jon, please.
you have to stop this. Everyone will die.
and the universe will not even notice.
in my opinion, the existence of life...
...is a highly overrated phenomenon.
just look around you.
mars gets along perfectly well without so much as a microorganism.
here, it's a constantly changing topographical map...
...flowing and shifting around the pole in ripples 10, 000 years wide.
so tell me...
...how would all of this be greatly improved by an oil pipeline?
by a shopping mall?
so it's too much to ask for a miracle?
miracles, by their definition, are meaningless.
Oh, God, Jon!
only what can happen does happen.
just stop your bullshit.
land this thing. Now.
as you wish.
you know what?
you can send me back to Earth to fry with Dan and my mom...
...and all the other worthless humans.
but know that you were wrong.
you said this ended with me in tears...
...and look: Nothing. Maybe you were wrong about everything.
you complain that I refuse to see life on life's terms...
...yet you continuously refuse to see things from my perspective.
you shut out what you're afraid of. I'm not afraid.
you want me to see things your way?
go ahead, show me. Do that thing you do.
magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!
it's not my fault you got old.
what do you have to complain about?
I put food on the table for you and your child.
call your friend Eddie. Maybe he can give you a better life.
even the grimy parts of it...
...keep on getting brighter.
you know, your mom, she was one of the all-time champion beauties.
you got her eyes, you know. You got...
take your hands off her.
Hey, doll. Long time no see.
not long enough in my book, Eddie. Get in the car.
now.
are there no depths you won't sink to?
Jesus Christ, Sally. Can't a guy talk to his...
...you know, old friend's daughter?
drive.
it was a mistake. One time.
guy tries to rape you, and years later, you let him finish the job?
what? Were you drunk or just lonely?
am I ever gonna live this down?
Laurie.
no.
no, not him.
the Comedian...
...was your father.
no.
No! No! No!
my life is just...
...one big joke.
I don't think your life is a joke.
Yeah, well...
...I'm sorry if I don't trust your sense of humor.
will you smile...
...if I admit I was wrong?
about what?
miracles.
events with astronomical odds of occurring...
...like oxygen turning into gold.
I've longed to witness such an event, and yet I neglect...
...that in human coupling...
...millions upon millions of cells compete to create life...
...for generation after generation...
...until finally, your mother...
...loves a man...
...Edward Blake, the Comedian, a man she has every reason to hate...
...and out of that contradiction, against unfathomable odds...
...It's you...
only...
...you.
that emerged.
to distill so specific a form...
...from all that chaos...
...is like turning air into gold.
a miracle.
and so...
...I was wrong.
now dry your eyes, and let's go home.
we got a bearing on that artificial structure.
heat signature's off the charts.
Veidt. I don't like the way Archie's kicking.
the engines. They're icing up. Hold onto something.
Daniel, you're coming in too low.
don't wish to interfere, but perhaps should pull up sharply...
I know! I'm trying. I'm trying to pull him up, goddamn it!
I'm gonna redirect the heat from the flamethrower to speed up deicing...
...but it's gonna take a while and we don't have time to wait.
you need something warmer.
fine like this.
what is it, girl?
Adrian's a pacifist.
he's a vegetarian, for chrissakes.
he's never killed anyone in his life.
Hitler was vegetarian.
you're squeamish, leave him to me. We won't get second chance.
gentlemen.
welcome. Adrian, we know everything.
then what's there to discuss, Dan?
plenty. You killed Comedian.
may he rest in peace.
Blake figured it out first.
Nixon had him keeping tabs on us, making sure we weren't rocking the boat.
Blake found out what I was doing here in Karnak...
...and by the time he visited poor Moloch, he was cracking badly.
even I couldn't predict he'd be the one to have a change of heart.
so...
...I had to kill him.
then I neutralized Jon. No easy task.
I put roughly $2 billion into tachyon research...
...to block Jon's vision of the future.
you used his psych profile to manipulate him.
got him to leave the planet.
I've known Jon long enough to see he isn't devoid of emotion.
his subtle facial twitches wouldn't be noticed by the layman, but to me...
...he might as well have been sobbing.
all I needed to do was tug on the thread.
the sudden flood of emotion Jon felt...
...when he came to believe he'd given cancer to the people he loved...
...was all the excuse he needed to leave Earth.
your bullshit assassin. You paid him to throw us off.
Mr. Chess gave his life in the service of a higher cause, Dan.
I put a cyanide capsule in his mouth...
...leaving only one loose end:
you, and your mask-killer theory...
...one you followed with the tenacity of a true sociopath.
I tipped off the police.
once you were in prison, I was able to move forward.
sorry to disappoint you.
we were supposed to make the world a better place.
Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.
nuclear war?
human extinction?
of course, my moral safeguards gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice.
a few key regions around the globe...
new York, Los Angeles, Moscow, Hong Kong.
disintegrated in an instant.
fifteen million people killed...
...By Dr. Manhattan himself.
the world's punishment for flirting with World War III.
jon wouldn't do that.
a fact no one outside this room ever has to know.
the energy breakthrough I was working on just came to fruition.
all these years, Jon was helping me replicate his power...
...unaware of how I planned to use it.
you see...
...the Comedian was right.
humanity's savage nature will inevitably lead to global annihilation.
so in order to save this planet...
...I had to trick it...
...with the greatest practical joke in human history.
killing millions. To save billions.
a necessary crime.
you know we can't let you do that.
do that, Rorschach?
I'm not a comic-book villain.
do you think I'd explain my masterstroke to you...
...if there were even the slightest possibility you could affect the outcome?
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.
Jesus Christ, Henry.
why the hell didn't we get a launch detection?
it's not the Soviets, sir.
intel indicates the energy signature...
...was generated by...
...Dr. Manhattan.
Jon.
interference.
cataclysmic interference.
I can't believe it happened.
this wasn't caused by nuclear warheads.
it was me.
I...
...did this.
what do you mean, you did this? Not directly.
it was made to look like I did it.
Adrian.
speak of the devil.
Jon... I know.
must stop him. Killed Blake, killed millions.
wait here.
Adrian, stop this.
the tachyons were clever...
...but even if I can't predict where you are,
I can turn the walls to glass.
I should thank you.
I'd almost forgotten the excitement of not knowing...
...the delights of uncertainty.
forgive me, girl.
you're such an asshole.
Veidt, you bastard.
if you've hurt her, I'll... Dan...
...grow up. My new world demands less obvious heroism.
your...
...schoolboy heroics are redundant. What have they achieved?
failing to prevent Earth's salvation...
...is your only triumph.
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.
I'm very disappointed.
reassembling myself was the first trick I learned.
it didn't kill Osterman.
did you really think it would kill me?
I have walked across the surface of the sun.
I have witnessed events so tiny and so fast...
...they can hardly be said to have occurred at all...
...but you, Adrian, you're just a man.
the world's smartest man...
...poses no more threat to me...
...than does its smartest termite.
what's that?
another ultimate weapon?
Yes.
you could say that.
came under attack.
millions of lives were suddenly ended...
...in an act of evil perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.
since the attacks, I have been in constant contact...
...with the premier of the U. S.S. R.
putting aside our past differences...
...we have both pledged to unite...
...against this common enemy.
with the rest of the world...
...we will prevail.
this is a day we shall never forget.
and yet we go forward to defend the human race...
...and all that is good and just in our world.
thank you. God bless us all.
do you see?
two superpowers retreating from war.
I've saved the earth from hell.
we both have.
this is as much your victory as it is mine.
now we can return...
...do what we were meant to.
we were meant to exact justice.
everyone's gonna know what you've done. Will they?
by exposing me, you would sacrifice the peace so many died for today.
peace based on a lie. But peace...
...nonetheless. He's right.
exposing Adrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again.
no. We can't do this.
on Mars...
...you taught me the value of life.
if we hope to preserve it here...
...we must remain silent.
keep your own secrets.
don't even think about it.
Rorschach.
wait.
never compromise.
not even in the face of armageddon.
that's always been the difference between us, Daniel.
I've made myself feel every death...
...see every innocent face I've murdered to save humanity.
you understand, don't you? Without condoning...
...or condemning...
...I understand.
out of my way. People have to be told.
you know I can't let you do that.
suddenly you discover humanity?
convenient.
if you'd cared from the start, none of this would have happened.
I can change almost anything...
...but I can't change human nature.
of course you must protect Veidt's new utopia.
what's one more body amongst foundations?
well, what are you waiting for?
do it.
do it!
No!
I'm leaving this galaxy for one a little less complicated.
I thought you said you cared about life again.
I do.
I think maybe I'll create some.
goodbye, Laurie.
come on.
come on!
Dan...
...a world united and at peace.
there had to be sacrifice.
No! You haven't idealized mankind, you've deformed it.
you've mutilated it.
that's your legacy.
that's the real practical joke.
we repeat, there is nothing wrong with your television set.
you are about to participate in a great adventure.
you are about to experience the awe and mystery...
...which reaches from the inner mind to the outer limits.
sure you don't want a drink?
I'm okay.
Cheers.
there's something I need to get off my chest.
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.
Laurel.
what you must think of me.
I'm sorry I never told you.
I should have...
...but I don't know, I just felt ashamed. I felt stupid.
it doesn't matter.
people's lives take them strange places.
they do strange things...
...and, well, sometimes they can't talk about them.
I know how that is...
...but I just want you to know...
...that you never did anything wrong by me.
you asked me why I wasn't mad at him.
because he gave me you.
Thanks, Mom.
I love you.
Hello, Miss Jupiter. Oh, Sally, please.
excuse me. Gotta go freshen up. I'll be right back.
so how's it going up here?
good. How's it going down there?
good. I think I've got everything working.
all of Archie's systems are upgraded.
finished the tinkering for now...
...so all we gotta do is take her out.
well, that sounds like a date.
are we gonna be all right?
long as people think Jon's still watching us, we'll be all right...in the end.
I know what Jon would say:
nothing ends.
nothing ever ends.
seymour, we got nothing to write about anymore.
everyone in the country...
...every country in the world are holding hands...
...and singing songs about peace and love.
it's like living in a goddamn global hippie commune.
well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna be running for president in '88.
we could run a piece on that.
seymour, we don't dignify absurdities with coverage.
this is still America, damn it.
who wants a cowboy in the White House?
okay. I could look for something in the crank file.
crank file.
whatever. Take some initiative.
run whatever you like. I leave it entirely in your hands.
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1955.
tonight, a comedian died in New York.
here you are, Mast.
I have something for you.
you might already have it.
I quite like it. Open it.
boy.
you really shouldn't have.
here... Look...
it's for your birthday.
look, you can use it for coffee too.
Thanks, son.
I'll make good use of it.
very good, son.
nothing's more important than your health.
okay. Drive. Go, go, go!
don't hang about.
drive, drive, drive...
Bennie?
dammit. What can we do? Fuck...
what have you done now?
I said: Straight through the front, not in the plants!
let's get out of here. Dammit. -Don't go. Don't go. Come and help.
Bennie, boy.
there's 400 grand here that I could've had in my pocket. I won't forget this.
mast! -Bennie!
too FAT TOO FURlOUS 5 YEARS AND 8 MONTHS LATER
hey Bennie! Bennie.
they let you out at last? Turn off the fucking noise.
I don't want to hear that loser either.
now reverse. Bennie, they let you out at last?
no. I'm fetching soap for the warder.
I say, Bennie. About that debt of yours. I have a job...
I'm not interested. Five years is enough. Give me my snack bar.
I don't think so. Unless you want it to have wooden drapes.
no, it's not closing. -No? You want to bet?
Chuck him out.
this is my cousin Vuck.
he's pretty good with electricity.
he can work on your snack bar. He can connect things up.
I don't need your Vuck.
his mother's worried about him.
so he's going to work for you until you've done my job.
I'll see you tomorrow at the first meeting.
off we go.
Oh that's right, Ben. Welcome home.
fucking Turk!
where did you buy your driver's license? Uzbekistan?
the crust looks firm.
and the mushy peas contrast beautifully.
Bennie...?
we thought you would be released tomorrow...
Where's my snack bar?
here...
we baked a quiche specially...
you were away five years... -...and eight months.
people want something different.
so Peter did a cookery course in quiches...
this is Vuck.
he's into electricity.
electricity? There's nothing wrong with that.
there is now.
Where's Mast?
why didn't Mast come to fetch me?
Bennie?
eh, that's my car. Is it for me?
it's for you.
what's the matter?
it's the liver.
I only have a few weeks.
it's all over, Bennie.
there's one thing you can do for me, Bennie.
I never told you, but...
...I have another son...
when I was flying the Tokyo run, I got involved with a stewardess.
she was pretty crazy.
we had a great weekend.
a few months later she told me she was pregnant.
you know how these things go.
his name is Koen.
I've never seen him.
she was so crazy.
I only have this photo of him.
and now you want Bennie to go and fetch him.
Yes, I don't have much time.
where is Koen? -Belgium.
Yes, but where? -You heard him, in Belgium.
in Liege...
in jail...
a couple of unpaid parking fines.
I don't think you gentlemen understand. This is a hospital.
are you allowed to smoke in a hospital?
now get lost, go on.
get out.
I'd love to see him, Bennie.
Hello, Mr Mast.
does it hurt when I press here?
Hey! You!
my father just told me he's been given up.
you said you can't do anything?
not much.
unfortunately Mr Mast is not eligible for an organ donation.
come again?
mr Mast is in very bad shape... -He didn't have an easy life.
I'd like to see you at his age. Shut up, man!
I'm talking to the doctor!
you see, there just aren't enough donors.
I can have a few tramps run over in no time.
the donor has to have the same blood type. Preferably a relative.
I am a relative.
but you weren't the real son, were you?
you were adopted, weren't you? And if you donate your liver, you'll die.
a dead relative is preferable.
okay.
add a little flour. A little salt. An egg...
nice jumper.
from Mast? -You have 15 minutes to pack.
what for?
we're going to Belgium. We have to fetch Mast's son.
right now?
that's the jail. Think of a plan to free him on the way...
we were about to go to a quiche competition.
you have 15 minutes.
Bennie, what we don't understand...
what's a kid with parking fines doing in Belgium's top security jail.
life isn't fair.
so, you have a plan. Come on. -Okay. Bennie. This is you.
Bennie, this is you.
okay, at visiting time, the guards take you to see Koen.
and Koen is here, in the exercise yard.
in the meantime, we set up a platform in a street beside the jail.
and if we place it at maximum height and at a 45 degree angle with that pole...
...then we can shoot a hook with a bungee cord and a cable.
we fix it to this pole...
...and all you have to do is grab Koen and cut the cord...
we will have put some mattresses on a building site where you can land.
the car will be there too, so we can drive straight back to Holland.
fine.
let's go for it.
HlGHEST SECURlTY JAlL lN LlEGE
in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen.
Koen? Your father wants to see you.
Koen.
your father wants to see you.
I don't have a father.
we're going to escape. Come on.
let go.
christ almighty.
come here.
now!
Bennie!
I hadn't counted on the dog. -Shut up!
this is your father. He wants to see you. Is that clear?
well, I'm starwing.
no way. You stay here and watch him.
d'you want anything?
yes... I'd like a ciabatta with mozzarella.
or, no. Make it...
...an organic gorgonzola club sandwich. -Cheese sandwich?
then the Taipei representative left the UN.
local news: a dangerous gangster escaped from Liege prison today.
he hasn't yet been caught.
koen M. is serwing a life sentence for the rape and murder of five women.
he was aided with his escape... -I thought it was for parking fines...
Yes, that too. -A guard and a dog were seriously hurt.
Bennie, he killed five women. And raped them.
they didn't feel a thing.
they were already dead.
she fell...
come on.
you look like me, a little.
you also have a...
I always sent your mother a card on your birthday.
did you ever get them?
what did they say?
happy birthday.
you were looking for me? -Promise me...
...you won't cry when I'm gone.
you'd found a suitable donor? I gathered. -Where are you going? Can I come too?
I'm going to die, kid.
no.
but you'll live on, kid. That's what's important.
I made a mistake.
Hey, Bennie.
look at that. He's still polishing his dad's wreck.
has he been buried yet, or must he die first?
you forgot me, didn't you? Yesterday.
and l... Christ almighty.
I sat waiting.
where were you?
perhaps it's my mistake. I didn't make myself clear.
so I brought a few colleagues.
I'll explain it again. Maybe then you'll understand.
hit it!
shit!
I hope it isn't broken.
what a pity.
I don't think he quite understands.
Christ, you did it again?
are you listening now?
you're doing a job for me? Remember? A little risk. A lot of money.
you get instructions in two days.
and remember... Today it's headlamps, tomorrow kneecaps. Dickhead!
you think that's funny, do you? Fish head.
it's quite simple. You can't get a legal liver anywhere.
the organ trade is illegal.
delicious quiche.
is that leak?
no, no. -Endive?
Yes. What about illegal?
eastern bloc, sometimes. But I wouldn't stake my life on it.
you're sure no relative died?
no, are there any other options? -Bolivia, of course.
you can have anything replaced for a price.
what does it cost?
about 300 grand. Euro.
can I have some more quiche? For my wife.
I want her to taste it.
Hello! May l? I'm just...
I think I can get a discount.
it'll still be about 270 thousand.
where will you get the money?
gg BANK NORTHERN DlSTRlCT
I want to transfer some money.
Katia Willaert?
the transfer is the sum of your assets. You know that?
and you want to transfer that to...
lars Meuleman?
Yes. Lars Meuleman, "The Amsterdam Hammer." European boxing champion.
could we hurry it up!?
stating that it's an... inheritance.
is there room for a comment? -Certainly.
l don't want...
... to see you and that blonde slut...
...at my funeral...
asshole.
is that too much?
not at all.
he was so happy.
then he made me this drawing.
lovely, isn't it?
Mast...
Hello?
Hello?
Koen.
can you talk a little louder?
I'm robbing a bank!
I have them all covered! -What?
now what? -Have you gone crazy?
we need money for Dad, don't we?
make the staff stand by the wall, away from the counter.
don't do anything without me. Just wait.
that was Koen, at the bank.
he's having trouble filling in a deposit form.
I'm glad you get on so well together.
it may sound grand, European boxing champion but it's all fixed.
they agree in advance who's going to win.
be quiet! -No! I don't care who hears.
it's all fake!
on Friday, Lars Meuleman is going down in the second minute of the third round...
shut your face!
or else...
or else what?
I'll shoot you!
go ahead.
Hey, it's Bennie!
lie down! All of you! Lie down!
okay, come on. Fill it with money. Now! Come on!
Hello?
might this be yours?
Ah, yes. Right. Merci.
lie down! Come on!
my jacket, Fatso!
who's a Fatso round here? -I have to wear it to a funeral!
what funeral? A woman's? -What's the difference!
put on that hat! And I'm not fat!
Hello, hello? Who's paying for my jacket? Fatso...
you, you... all of you. Come with me!
come with me!
Hello, hostage takers.
my name is Jennifer and I'm here for you.
we can defeat this crisis if we trust each other.
come on!
run! Faster, bitch...
come on, run...
sit down, bitch!
drive!
drive! Drive, bitch! -No! I need to pee.
drive. Christ. Drive.
is this the only road you can take?
you talk about integration every day. Why don't they integrate this road?
keys!
keys!
key.
Christ...
what's your name? -Katia...
you mentioned a funeral?
Yes, a girl who committed suicide. Unrequited love.
Hello!
and what's the girl's name? -Katia.
will you stop chattering? I'm trying to concentrate.
I fear she's dead.
I fear she's dead?
why can't you learn to speak proper Dutch!
it's your fault we raided that bloody bank!
I was to arrange the money! -Something's blocking the way.
where?
shit!
fuck.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
a LlTTLE FURTHER DOWN
does that belong to Dad? -Put that sheet back. Yes, she's dad's.
she? -Yes...
mast always called her Betsy.
after his first great love.
I was his driver, from when I was sixteen.
we interrogated Teddy Vee on the back seat.
it took hours to scrub it clean again.
that's not even 1 00, 000 Euros. They won't even cut him open for that.
a bank robbery. That's a great idea!
what about his car? Can't we sell his car?
listen, dog breath, I'll only say this once.
this isn't just a car.
it's Betsy, Mast's car.
if you want to sell her, you might as well go to the hospital and pull the plug.
understood?
but how will we get money for the liver?
stand up! Go on! Get up!
and now...
the moment you've been waiting for... The Battle of the Titans!
the Apocalypse!
here and now: Andrew "The Fist from Hoorn..."
...and Lars "Amsterdam Hammer" Meuleman!
that's him...
that guy's going down in the third?
Hey, the bald one... Going down in the third.
Katia says it's a fixed match. The bald one's her ex.
he's at 3 to 1.
when he goes down, we'll earn about three grand.
that's just enough for the liver.
come on!
come on!
christ almighty.
is that him? -Yes.
but Bennie, are you sure...
he already had a hard blow.
what?
hey Vuck.
here. Wash it.
Hey, Yugo rat. I said wash it!
don't wear it, wash it...
Hey, who are you, man?
someone who lost three grand on you, asshole.
I wanted to take a dive!
really, but he tripped over the ropes!
that wasn't the deal...
well, that's not my problem, it's yours.
tell me, what shall we do?
my jumper!
we can still save it!
well...
...he won't pay up now.
christ almighty.
okay. What was the job?
I'll join in. But we share.
did you hear that? Bennie, man. You should be happy I let you join in.
270, 000 Euros. Take it or leave it.
Bennie...
here's what you have to do. Don't mess up, eh? Fatso.
but I have a good liver.
why don't you take mine?
no, kid.
I've had a good life.
yours only just started. Make something of it.
find a woman.
have some children.
but I'm not into children.
you weren't made to be alone, Koen.
what was it we said?
only visits during visiting hours. Come on.
we'll never get better this way.
they already gave up on me.
when your father dies, it'll be your fault too.
she fell.
what's with those women? It'll end in tears.
Hey!
Katia.
you had that coming, idiot.
no one can tell me what to do, and certainly not a masked Fatso!
filthy Fatso! Filthy dumb...
I'm not fat.
Lars?
okay. May I have your attention?
next Saturday we'll... -Wash.
we're going to the airport to rob a money transport for Milo.
so... -So...
Martin? -We can't make it on Saturday...
we have a contest for the best quiche of the year.
so. On Saturday we rob a money transport at the airport.
are you okay?
put some ice on it.
Koen, you wait here in the busy-ness class lou-nge.
and how do I reach there?
how to reach there? You're not reaching anywhere, you are to wait there.
here. How? Why should I care?
very well, Saturday.
we start early Saturday morning... -She hit me with a ham.
ham? -I could have been dead.
what kind of ham? Ardennes? Parma?
raw? Smoked? -That's not the point.
well, she caught a cold.
stay in for a week and she'll be right as rain.
get lost. You can walk. Come on. We're having a meeting.
get lost? First you point a gun at me!
then you kidnap me, shoot me in the arm and freeze me...
but I'm glad that unreliable son of a bitch Lars is dead.
I'll take you home. Come on. -Wait, we're in a meeting!
the Business Class lounge, right?
Saturday...
yes?
wash...
saturday, we go by ambulance.
give me that.
I want to thank you.
for not shooting me in the bank.
come up for coffee. Or...? -Fine.
I think I'm confused by that whole Lars thing...
it's so weird. You get bogged down in a relationship.
it's leading nowhere, but you won't let go.
then he two-timed me with that filthy blonde slut.
...you try to go on with your life, but I couldn't get him out of my mind.
it wasn't until I saw him in your freezer...
make yourself at home.
I need to pee.
I'll have a shower if you don't mind.
that is, if the plumbing still works.
you can't get any good plumbers these days.
will you make some coffee?
Oh, don't use the water for a bit!
the cups are in the cupboard on the right.
milk is in the fridge if you want some.
are you going to fix my shower? How sweet...
Hey, I'm down here.
do that again? -What? This?
with your tongue, like that... -Oh, you mean this.
have you had many girls?
alive?
only you...
...and my mother.
isn't that illegal?
it happened in Belgium.
so you never want to get married again?
no, never again.
unless it's really serious, of course.
don't stay too long.
wait a minute...
you mean...?
Really?
Koen! Don't mess around!
you want to... with me?
we have to go on our honeymoon first. -When?
what are you doing tomorrow?
you're a sweetheart!
mast.
Koen, he...
dad, I found a woman.
a living woman.
and her breasts aren't cold. And they're not hard.
they're just like two balloons full of tepid water.
and you can move them up and down.
and you can bite them. And pinch them hard.
and if you play with them long enough, they get hard tips.
that's so beautiful...
and she wants to marry me.
sorry, would you mind leaving? -Can't you see we're busy?
kid, give me those keys.
they're in that closet.
car keys.
Oh, sorry...
you have to promise me, kid.
is that the big gold car in the garage?
Yes.
I say...
LOCATlON A: AMSTERDAM AlRPORT
ticket... plane...
don't be late, okay?
plane. Go ahead.
go on.
go on!
Yes. Bennie, it's Milo.
yes? -Hello.
how are things looking? -Fine. We're ready.
Oh, then I'll be seeing you soon, won't l?
I'm giving him some morphine to ease the pain.
Bennie.
we were going for a stroll in the hospital garden.
no, Mast. We're going flying. -Ah, flying.
as a pilot? -No, as a passenger.
no one's here yet.
we checked in far too early.
here's some more morphine. Just in case...
sorry I can't stay, but I have an important...
...appointment...
it's always exciting when there's a chance you could get caught.
don't you think?
gently... They mustn't catch on.
they're ready! The money transport has arrived!
money transport arrived.
we should have left her in the freezer.
Bennie, take it easy with the morphine. -Why?
I think they can mend the bike in the next village.
just a little bit...
I need to pee...
where is he? That headcase.
Hello? I'm Vuck.
I know who you are! You're going to the plane.
and you'll do exactly what we discussed! Yes?
Koen, can you see Vuck?
Yes, he's boarding the plane now...
I'll kick that stupid halfwit... Vuck! What are you doing, man?
come back down! Do what we discussed! Take the photo!
sir! Would you mind going aboard?
photo? -We really don't have time.
he's chatting to the stewardess.
what? -Please?
very well. One photo, quickly!
what's Vuck doing now? -He has to go to the right.
under the wing. To the right, Vuck. The right!
right a little.
head a little more to the right, Vuck. Right.
Vuck, move right. -Vuck is in position! I repeat.
Vuck! Take the photo now!
what's going on?
Jeanette AMV at G-731 for dispatching.
ambulance needed urgently. Passenger hurt.
to think these corals took thousands of years to form that reef.
drive! Come on, drive!
drive, drive, drive, drive.
love and marriage, like a horse and carriage...
Koen, we're going now. We'll see you at location B.
bastard.
did you see that? -Yes.
that guy was eating a cheese quiche.
we're not getting married!
you've been leading me on. You and that Fatso!
and I had to pay for my own ticket.
and you're not welcome at my funeral.
here we are, champagne!
I think it was a leak quiche. -No, man.
the crust was different from leak.
HQ, who cleared that ambulance?
who is it for?
calm down, sir. It'll be all right.
I know a cheese quiche from...
watch out! Watch out!
drive. Keep driving!
I can't see a thing... I can't see...
keep driving! Go on!
shut the hatch and unfasten those containers!
Hey, who are you? -You're not...
come on! Take off! Now!
Bennie! They're shooting at us!
when I return, we'd better be flying! Is that clear?
Martin, cockpit! Keep an eye on the pilot!
unfasten that damned container!
who was that? -The pilot.
we're going to crash! -Man, we haven't even taken off yet!
mast, we're going to fly. Now!
no, Mast we're going to fly!
mast! Mast!
calm down. The ambulance is on its way.
LOCATlON B: lJSSELMEER QUAY 1 3A
get lost, halfwit!
great! Come to papa!
keep it steady! Mind my paintwork!
Hey, gently!
don't hang on it! -My paintwork!
gently! Let go of that thing!
let go! Okay. We'll haul it in.
mast!
mast! -What?
Bennie!
are you okay? Keep calm. I'm here.
your ears are fine, asshole.
hey Bennie.
too bad about your container.
I really wanted you to have it. Better luck next time.
keys.
Hey, fuck! Don't shoot!
die for a dead man, Bennie.
keys, Milo.
now walk! You too, move it.
relax, man. -You! Put Mast in that van.
jump! Jump!
jump!
Hey, fuck!
you're more likely to drown if you're dead.
you know what I mean. Jump. Jump.
and jump.
guys.
too bad about all that money.
I have everything I wanted.
you did all this for me.
there are sons you get...
...and sons you can choose.
Bennie! We have a problem.
all of you get out of that bus.
what was it you said?
keys.
keys!
keys!
Hey! Bring that thing back!
dad? -I'm happy I knew you, Koen.
it's a pity I won't be at the wedding. -Calm down.
mast? Damn it. Listen to me for once...
good luck. And keep an eye on Koen.
look after yourself, boy.
mast! Mast!
okay! Stop, old fart!
you can't scare me, Milo. What about you?
this is your last warning! Stop! Now! -Do as they say! Stop!
stop!
fire!
mast!
come on.
she doesn't want me anymore.
you just have to try harder.
and you promised dad. Come on.
you're attracted to her, right? See to it that she's attracted to you.
Christ! My car.
she jumped. -At last!
who are you?
what's this? Where am l?
well you...
...dropped in to see your fiance.
he... -He's going...
...to marry you.
him?
what a handsome guy.
it's been serwiced.
it's standing here.
and when it takes a bend to the left...
...it veers to the right. Bear that in mind.
if you put it in fourth, take it easy. -Bennie!
dad asked me to give you the keys.
he said that maybe we would get together some day...
hey...
where are you going?
to the registry office. With Katia.
mast always sat in the back too.
too FAT TOO FURlOUS
welcome to the Quiche of the Year!
and now to find out who won the Grand Prix for the Best Quiche!
Congratulations. What did you stick in it?
you're telling me the fucking CIA thinks I'm working for al-Qaeda?
I think you're working for al-Qaeda.
we were wrong about Brody.
wait!
I was-I was wrong.
this weekend, this time that we spent together, it was real.
Hey, Carrie, fuck you.
I pray every day that you never lose sight of what you committed to do in Issa's name.
this is Issa, my son.
I want him to learn English.
the house must be strong to keep them safe.
that's truly excellent.
a drone missile hit and destroyed part of a compound in the mountains of Northern Iraq.
the images being broadcast of the bodies of 83 dead children allegedly killed in the strike, we believe to be false, created by the terrorists for propaganda purposes.
the vice president
the man most instrumental in the drone attack that killed young Issa is going to ask you to run for political office.
say yes. That will be a signal to Nazir that you are still committed to do this.
aileen just ID'd Tom Walker. He's the terrorist.
Tom was dead. That's what they told me.
what we need to do is find him before anything happens.
Walker-- he meets with a man to do business.
he drives a car with the diplomatic plates.
that's it on the left-- home of our Saudi diplomat.
what if Mr. Zahrani doesn't give us anything anytime soon?
we'll figure out an elegant way to lift and interrogate him.
what do we know? Very little, that's what.
but in our line of work, sometimes very little is just enough.
take Mansoor Al Zahrani.
mild-mannered second secretary of the Saudi embassy.
seen here going to work three days ago.
we surveilled him 24/7.
we've listened to every phone call he's made in the last week.
we pawed through his professional life, his financial life, his personal life.
in short, we turned him upside down and we shook real hard.
two items of interest fell out.
item one--Al Zahrani's in debt to the tune of about $750, 000, all due to investments even I'd know better than to make.
item two--Al Zahrani's gay.
he's got three wives, ten children.
he's a devout and conscientious Muslim.
yet, every Thursday when everyone thinks he's out jogging in Rock Creek Park, he's in fact, visiting this bathhouse off Dupont Circle.
we managed to get inside during his most recent visit.
as you can see, he's a naughty boy.
I believe that item one and item two will get us what we want, which is for this son of a bitch to tell where Tom Walker is and what he and Abu Nazir are plotting.
most of Al Zahrani's debt is carried by a private equity bank called Market Security.
as I said, we don't have much, but we definitely have something.
william Pritchard? - That's me.
I'm Carrie Mathison.
you're really a spy?
uh, an intelligence officer actually.
this is very cool. Can I tell my wife about this?
no. - Even cooler.
as I mentioned on the phone, we're interested in one of your clients-- Mansoor Al Zahrani.
Yeah, I pulled his file. Makes dismal reading.
how'd you like to cause him some pain?
I'd rather have the money he owes us, but short of that, pain might be satisfying.
what can I do?
we'd like to borrow your bank.
you sure I can't tell my wife?
sergeant Brody? - Yes.
we need to check your house, sir.
what the fuck? - We're Secret Service, sir.
sergeant Brody, sorry for the intrusion.
everyone's a little on edge because of your sniper buddy I'm afraid.
I have to ask-- is Walker as good a shot as they say he is?
Yes, he is.
too bad for us.
clear the room.
I'm very impressed with the way you've handled coming back to the real world.
thank you, sir.
representative Richard Johnson-- mean anything to you?
I watch the news.
how would you feel about running for his seat in the upcoming special election?
I would consider it a honor to work with a man who's actually fought the war on terror.
who's lived among the enemy, and understands them.
what do you think? You interested?
Yeah.
I'm interested.
good news, good news.
I'd need to talk to my wife first.
is that a problem?
to be honest, it could be.
well, we need her on board. She's half the story.
war hero returns home after eight years' imprisonment to his beautiful, loving wife.
I'm sure you'll be able to convince her.
al Zahrani's got diplomatic immunity.
that may not mean much to you people, but to us mere mortals in the State Department, that's a serious issue.
we're not dragging him to Tunisia.
we're not waterboarding. We'll be very polite and gentle.
I just want to ask him some questions during his lunch hour.
the CIA's not even supposed to be operating on American soil.
it's against your own charter. This is the FBI's job.
al Zahrani's running a terrorist cell out of the Saudi embassy.
he and Tom Walker are planning an attack on the United States.
fuck the charter.
he doesn't mean that. - Yes, I do.
you don't know if this thing will work.
you grab the guy...Entice.
you entice the guy into the bank, and then what?
you got a couple of hours maybe. - We figure two at the outside.
you have two measly hours before the Saudi embassy starts missing him.
what if he doesn't turn?
being gay in Saudi Arabia is like being the Antichrist here.
I'm aware of our cultural differences with Saudi Arabia.
if Al Zahrani doesn't turn and we blow the whistle on him, he can look forward to losing everything.
I mean everything. - I see no compelling reason not to do this.
were you not listening? I just gave you ten of them.
I'm going to the secretary on this one, David.
and I will be appending all of my objections right on the fucking order.
append away.
Carrie, I want you to run the interrogation.
shouldn't it be Saul?
al Zahrani will be thrown if it's a woman.
might give us some leverage. David's right.
everything we know about Al Zahrani's in here.
are you sure you're okay with my doing this?
you're the right person for the job.
I'm fine.
remember what you said to me way back about getting the truth out of these guys?
what? - You're trying to find what makes them human, not what makes them terrorists.
sounds like good advice.
better get started.
Oh, Jesus. You scared me. - Sorry.
kids get to school okay?
Yeah, with the usual hysterics.
Chris is convinced he's the worst athlete in the entire eighth grade, and Dana's convinced she's a lesbian,'cause boys disgust her.
what's going on?
while you were gone, I had a visitor.
who?
vice President of the United States.
in our house? It's a mess.
I doubt he noticed.
what did he want?
you remember Congressman Johnson?
that poor bastard we saw on the TV at Gaines' house?
he's resigning, and they want me to run for his seat.
I knew it. You said no, right?
well, I said I'd talk it over with you first.
you're actually considering it? You can't be serious.
well, what else am I gonna do?
hell, stay in the Corps and go back to Iraq?
Brody, we're just getting our lives back on track.
we're just getting our marriage back on track.
and you want to go into politics? We'll never see you.
it'll be like you're leaving us all over again.
I'll carve out plenty of time for you and the kids. - No. Absolutely not.
you cannot do this.
I think I can make a difference.
do you want our family to be dragged through the mud by every newspaper and cable news channel in the country? Because that's what's gonna happen - they're gonna dig for dirt until they found it. - You don't know that.
me and Mike. You and that CIA lady you fucked.
don't be naive.
it'll all come out, every last gory detail.
I got to go change.
I seem to have become one of those women who takes her kids to school in her pajamas.
wives.
three-- Zahra, Hala and Yasmeen.
he met Zahra when they were both 15.
an arranged marriage, of course.
he had his first five children with her.
Gamila, Huda and Wadiya.
how can someone be 15 and married?
what could a 15-year-old possibly know about the intricacies of a relationship, about taking care of a family?
more than you do?
Hey, it's me, Brody.
you there?
Yeah, I'm here. - I need to see you.
Why?
it's personal.
well, when? - Now.
I-I can't. How about tomorrow night?
what's wrong with tonight? - I'm working.
Yeah, she's working.
who's that? - Uh, nobody. It's a... a neighbor.
you sure you can't make it tonight?
Yeah, I'm sure. Sorry.
okay, tomorrow. When and where?
we could go to that bar.
why don't I just come to your place?
Oh... Okay. Sure.
7: 00? I'll text you the address.
okay, great. See you then.
hot date?
hardly.
so you're texting your address to a plumber?
it's none of your fucking business who I'm texting my address to.
so you think we have enough?
you think Al Zahrani will turn?
well, you know as well as I do, there's guys who roll over and beg and mercy,
are you good?
eye contact, please.
I'm good.
good. It's good that you're good.
good is a good thing.
they told me I might find you in here.
working on your jump shot?
something like that.
how's the jaw? - Fine.
I'm sorry, dude. I was way out of line.
no. I deserved it.
what do you want, Brody?
I'm telling you, man, this whole coming home thing is tough.
I hear you. - I'm either parading around like a toy soldier or doing the fucking laundry.
I need to be of service. I need to do something that matters.
I've been asked by Vice President Walden to run for congress.
you fucking serious? - Yeah.
Jess doesn't want me to do it.
she's exercising her veto rights. - Why?
I think she's afraid of being in the limelight.
you want to do it?
I got to do something.
either that or I keep being pulled back into fucking Iraq.
it's messing with my family.
I get these moods.
I'm no fun to be around.
Hey, Mikey, you and you and Jessica...
you didn't do anything wrong.
and I can't blame you for whatever happened.
you thought I was dead.
and I know you guys got close.
and I'm sure it's not easy for you to say good-bye to each other.
and, um, this whole situation is entirely fucked up.
talk to Jessica.
tell her how much this means to me.
I got to get my family back together.
and, um... she'll listen to you.
Thanks.
Hey, something else.
you took care of my kids.
I'll always be grateful.
right this way. We'll get it all sorted out.
I'd like to introduce you to Eli Soodik and Carol Sweetzer, my top loan officers. They'll lay out the details of your debt restructuring.
I'll leave you to it.
I'm around if you need me.
security. It's an unfortunate necessity these days.
security for what?
it's not like you're going to hand me cash after all.
please sit down. Let's begin.
we have some questions we'd like to ask you. We don't have much time.
we need to get you back to your embassy by the end of lunch hour.
you're not loan officers. Who are you?
I would like to leave now. - I'm afraid we can't allow that.
you're CIA? FBI?
whoever you are, you can't hold me. I'm a Saudi diplomat.
I have diplomatic protection. You know what,
I'm going to call my embassy right now.
this is outrageous. I will not allow it.
my ambassador will go straight to the White House and you will both lose your jobs.
why don't you take a look at these photographs.
then you can call anyone you want.
here.
I will not betray my country.
of course not.
sit down please.
you owe Market Security $750, 000.
your salary at the Saudi embassy is $170, 000 a year.
you've sold all of your stocks in the past three years.
you have no savings. You have no other real estate holdings.
is that a fair summation?
your point?
you're spending more than you make.
substantially. - Is that a crime?
no, not in and of itself, but it is curious to note that you are somehow meeting all of your financial obligations.
what's in Geneva?
cuckoo clocks.
why have you traveled there six times in the past year?
business for my government.
well, our friends in Switzerland inform us that on the morning of last Saturday, you had breakfast at the Beau-Rivage Hotel with a man named Faraz Sabbaq.
he handed you an envelope.
you then carried this envelope to the Clariden Leu Bank on Rue Francois-Versonnex.
20 minutes later you exited the Clariden Leu Bank without the envelope.
you should know that Swiss officials had their eyes on Sabbaq, and then you of course, because he is a trusted courier for Abu Nazir.
I don't know Abu Nazir.
abu Nazir gives money to Sabbaq, Sabbaq hands money to you, you deposit the money in a Swiss bank and use it to pay your bills.
why lose everything for a cause you don't even believe in?
you're obviously not a zealot.
you don't believe in radical Islam. You love the West.
no more questions. I am done talking to both of you.
do you really want me to share these photos with your wives, your children, your parents, your ambassador?
go ahead.
tell everyone you want. Tell them all, I don't care.
I suck cock and I love it.
my wives already know. They don't care.
they love me. So fuck it, huh?
and fuck you. Put me on CNN.
I'll admit to everything.
now I would like to go back to my embassy.
sit the fuck down! I'm not finished!
Oh, I think you are. - Mr. Al Zahrani, I'd like to remind you...
you love your children very much, don't you?
do you have a favorite?
no, of course not.
I think Janine is your favorite.
she is a very remarkable young woman, but all of my children are remarkable.
not one of your other children is a sophomore at Yale majoring in political philosophy.
not one of your other children was a National Merit Scholar.
not one of your other children has spent two full days with you at the Phillips Gallery, happily looking at your beloved Impressionists.
we would deport her.
and we would make sure that she was not welcome in England, or Germany, or France, or Italy, or even all-forgiving Scandinavia.
we would make sure that she had no choice but to go back to Saudi Arabia and get fat and wear a burkha for the rest of her miserable life.
what do you do for Abu Nazir in return for the money he gives you?
what do you do for Abu Nazir in return for the money he give you?
I keep my ears open.
tell him what the Saudi government is thinking.
general information.
you met with Tom Walker at least three times at the Mount Olivet Mosque last week, correct?
Yes.
Tom Walker is working for Abu Nazir?
Yes.
was he meant to shoot the president from the roof of a house near Ronald Reagan Airport?
I don't know anything about that.
where is Tom Walker now?
he's lying low. - Where?
I don't know.
what's his current assignment? - I don't know.
when will you know? - When Abu Nazir decides to tell me.
what the tradecraft for setting a meeting with Walker?
I put my child's drawing of a red heart in the window of my living room.
when would the meeting take place?
the next day at noon.
where?
Farragut Square by the fountain.
Mr. Al Zahrani,
I'd like you to go back to your house now, put that drawing in your window tonight.
tomorrow afternoon, I'd like you to proceed as you normally would to meet Tom Walker.
okay?
so I'm bait? - You're bait.
you're free to go now.
what happens to me after all of this?
go about your business, live your life.
we say nothing to Saudi intelligence about your connections to Abu Nazir, you say nothing to Abu Nazir about our little get-together.
you work for us now.
welcome to the CIA.
Oh, damn it!
Mike. - Hello.
Hi. Come in.
no, it's better if I stay out here.
Oh, okay.
how have you been?
shitty.
Brody came to see me.
he did?
apologized for slugging me.
he said he doesn't blame either one of us for anything.
I mean, Christ, he even thanked me for taking care of the kids.
I know. He's trying, Jess, he's really trying.
he told me about being asked to run for congress.
told me you were against it.
I'm just thinking of the family.
what's best for the family.
Jess, right now, Brody's a marine without a mission.
he's a lost man wandering around in the fog. This thing, really means a lot to him. He wants to be of service.
he wants to do this.
let him.
he'll be a better father, a better husband.
he put you up to this.
Yeah, he did. So what?
he's right.
that's unbelievable.
he comes to you and now here you are, on his behalf?
it's a little incestuous, isn't it?
why don't we all just take off our clothes and get in bed together?
Jess, come on. - I got to go.
hi there. - Hi.
come on in.
do you like jazz?
I don't know anything about it.
here we go. - Oh, no thanks.
I really just came around to ask you something.
I need you to be honest. - What?
does anybody at the CIA know about our weekend up at the cabin?
no.
you didn't tell anybody? - No.
you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure.
is there any way they could find out?
not unless I did tell them. - Which you wouldn't do.
believe it or not, I value my privacy.
why the concern?
I've been asked to run for political office.
political office? What are you talking about?
vice President Walden wants me to run for Congressman Johnson's seat.
Really?
well, that's....
that's surprising.
I don't want to do it if there's even a chance the media would find out about us.
I can't do that to Jessica.
I've been shitty enough as it is, and she deserves better.
and she's going to get it.
Jessica will never know.
Thanks.
I should get back home.
Yeah, I'm beat.
it's been a rough day.
you promise me this will stay between us?
I promise.
good-bye.
good night.
off to work we go.
all right, we're about 20 minutes out.
excuse me.
saul, any sign of Walker?
nothing yet.
we got 15 of our people in the square.
and Carrie's running point down there.
remember, everybody, Walker is armed and dangerous.
we don't want a firefight. We're here to nab him, not spook him.
don't move until Walker's in the grab zone.
Carrie? - I know the protocol, Saul.
this isn't my first polka.
whit, how you doing?
sniper One in position.
we're passing National Cathedral.
traffic is loosening up. We should be there any minute.
any sign of Walker?
quadrant report.
North. No Walker.
east. Nothing.
west. Nothing.
South? - South. Nothing.
okay, we're here.
al Zahrani's moving into to Farragut Square, southwest corner.
I got Al Zahrani.
where the fuck is Walker?
I'm looking.
I'm looking.
Zahrani's approaching the fountain.
bait is set.
ten o'clock.
possible Walker. He's... got a green watch cap.
black fleece. He's carrying a briefcase.
target in range.
whit, don't get trigger-happy.
you're just there in case this whole thing goes to shit.
looks like he's headed to the fountain all right.
nobody makes a move until Walker's in the grab zone.
I can't see his face. I need visual confirmation.
Finklestein, you're up front. Go for a clear view.
Roger that. - Franklin, Patrelli, approach him from the east.
10-4. - On it.
he's approaching Al Zahrani.
I want that positive ID now.
shit. Finklestein? - I'm trying.
it could be Walker. It's hard to tell. His head's down.
Patrelli? - Black male, six feet, clean-shaven, athletic.
I can't tell.
he's carrying the briefcase in his left hand.
so? - Walker's right-handed.
what about his watch? Can anybody see his watch?
it's on his right wrist.
I don't like this, Saul.
should I engage? - Negative.
what's in the briefcase?
saul, what's in the fucking briefcase?
wait for my command. - Copy that.
shit. Pull back. Get everyone out of here.
everyone, get out of here!
the explosion occurred during the busy lunch hour and killed five people, wounded dozens, and shut down the city Metro line.
FBI special agents have joined D. C. police in cordoning off the area.
it was a suicide bomber--a terrorist attack right here in D. C.
we don't know that.
it's just unbelievable.
Hey. Listen.
it's probably just some crazy guy who learned how to make a bomb on the Internet.
okay?
the most important thing is not to panic.
okay.
where are the kids?
they're doing their homework. - Are they okay?
they're scared.
all right. I'll go and talk to them.
Hey. Did you think any more about the, uh, politics of it all?
Mike delivered your message.
And?
I told the kids about the vice president wanting you to run.
you told them?
we discussed how it would affect our future, that there would be publicity and scrutiny and gossip...
but in the end, we all agreed that we wanted you to do it.
just to be clear, are you saying yes?
just promise me I won't lose you again.
I promise.
then yes. It's a yes.
thanks for coming out, folks.
Dr. Steiner says you're going to live.
all you got was a really bad concussion.
no more head bashing for a while. Cut back on the drinking.
otherwise, you're good to go.
get some really good drugs and a week's rest before you head back to the glue factory.
I'd love some good drugs and a week's rest.
lucky you.
in case you're wondering about the bomber
black guy with the briefcase
his name was Samuel Everett. Homeless guy.
Walker met him at the shelter.
must have paid him to go meet Al Zahrani.
how did Walker know?
who warned him?
same person who slipped Hamid a razor blade so that he could slash his wrists.
and the same person who warned Raqim Faisel and Aileen Morgan that we were onto their safe house near the airport.
you were right.
abu Nazir has someone inside the U. S. government.
turn it up.
and he is resolute in the fight against terrorism, which struck at the heart of this nation's capitol just yesterday.
he will be equally resolute in the fight against runaway spending and profligate management at the highest levels of government.
it gives me great pleasure and pride to stand here today before you having been given the generous opportunity to serve.
you know, what I really came to understand lying in a dark hole for eight years in the Middle East was that service for your country is the highest calling.
sacred and profound.
you want your portrait up on the walls of Langley someday?
find Walker.
Walker's not even critical.
he's just a part, a piece, a pixel.
there is a bigger, pernicious, Abu Nazir-worthy plot out there, and we have little time.
Carrie... you're not yourself.
she's bipolar.
this explosion must have sent her into a flight.
Carrie said something interesting.
sniper attack-- that doesn't make sense for Abu Nazir.
it's not his methodology.
well, maybe it is when he has a military sniper working for him.
she thinks something bigger.
the switch is here.
wait until the last second before you open it.
I read that part of the blast goes upward toward here-- point of weakness.
hello.
I'm calling about Abu Nazir.
something happened to him, a tragedy.
you were with him then. Y-You have insight.
would it help if we met?
I'm home. - Stay there.
sergeant Brody called me.
he told me everything.
your office at Langley's being cleared as we speak.
I am about to solve this fucking thing!
strip it.
I'm so sorry.
I feel responsible in a way.
cause when you came back from Baghdad, I knew.
you were damaged.
there's no time, Saul.
it's high purple.
day 1
my name is Nicholas Brody...
and I'm a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps.
I have a wife...and two kids...
who I love.
by the time you watch this, you'll have read a lot of things about me, about what I've done, and so I wanted to explain myself.
so that you'll know the truth.
on May 19, 2003, as part of a two-man sniper team serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom,
I was taken prisoner by forces loyal to Saddam Hussein.
those forces then sold me to an al-Qaeda commander-- Abu Nazir, who was operating a terrorist cell from across the Syrian border where I was held captive for more than eight years.
I was beaten...
I was tortured...
and I was subjected to long periods of total isolation.
people will say I was broken, I was brainwashed.
people will say that I was turned into a terrorist, taught to hate my country.
I love my country.
what I am is a marine, like my father before me and his father before him, and as a marine,
I swore an oath to defend the United States of America against enemies both foreign and domestic.
my action this day is against such domestic enemies
the vice president and members of his national security team, who I know to be liars and war criminals responsible for atrocities they were never held accountable for.
this is about justice for 82 children...
whose deaths were never acknowledged and whose murder is a stain on the soul of this nation.
any change?
afraid not.
how worried should we be?
worried.
I haven't seen her like this in a long time.
she's not eating, she hasn't left her room in three days.
what about the lithium?
I thought you said that'd be kicking in by now.
it has kicked in.
this is the depression that comes in the wake of the mania.
it's actually much harder to treat.
think some chicken soup would help?
it might.
elixir of the gods.
can I go see her? - Of course.
what does being on administrative leave mean exactly?
well...
she's not going to face any criminal charges, thank God, but we shouldn't kid ourselves.
she's never going to set foot in Langley again.
Hey, you.
Hey, Mr. Berenson.
remember when I used to call you that?
what?
Mr. Berenson.
yeah... a long-ass time ago.
back when I could still piss in a straight line.
how are you, Carrie?
I've been better.
don't worry, I can't stay long.
why don't you tell me a story?
what kind of a story?
about a bad man named Nazir who took a break from doing bad things, only nobody could figure out why.
you know I can't talk about that.
I know, until my security clearance is restored.
I know.
you need to concentrate on getting better.
at least tell me that you're still looking into it, that you won't give up.
you promise me that.
promise.
no, don't go.
why did he do it?
who? - Brody.
Why?
do what?
call Estes and... rat me out like that.
honestly, I can think of a hundred reasons.
the man's running for congress in case you forgot.
think about it.
you're the last person he needs in his life right now, and vice versa.
but, Saul... - Listen to me.
this man has poisoned your thoughts.
he has cost you almost everything.
forget him.
I can't, Saul, I can't.
my God.
you're in love with him.
good night, Isabelle.
good night.
I'm looking at a lot of distinguished faces here tonight.
yours, Elizabeth.
the only reason I'm here at all.
thank you for convincing me three years ago to accept the nomination for Vice President.
and yours, Richard.
you are the core of what I'm confident will be our next administration.
we've all been on a long, difficult journey.
but tomorrow morning, when I announce my candidacy, we will throw down a gauntlet--all of us here in this room
promising to put America first again.
hear! Hear!
good to see you, Walt.
very nice.
you know, you're right.
it's a distinguished group. - Includes you, David.
it's a group worth protecting, that's my point.
if you're asking me to call off tomorrow, you know the answer.
I'm only suggesting that we change the venue.
so I can announce a candidacy from some hiding place?
you give them too much credit, you know that?
who's that, sir?
the enemy. Guys like Walker.
he can do a lot of damage.
to both of us.
Yes, he can.
but he's only one guy, and you have the entire Homeland Security apparatus at your disposal.
for both our sakes, take care of it.
and for God's sakes, drink your champagne.
it's Billecart-Salmon.
Oh, not again.
I'm sorry, ma'am, but...
I know, I know.
residents only. What's it this time?
it's a major policy address in the morning.
vice President, I think.
Oh, fucker.
ma'am?
serves me right for buying two blocks from the State Department.
well, I'm sorry for the inconvenience, Mrs. Sammler.
you have a nice night.
officers?
okay, Mrs. Sammler.
knock, knock.
your night nurse is here.
I made spaghetti amatriciana.
you know, Carrie, you're gonna to have to eat sooner or later.
damn it, Carrie.
you are starting to scare me.
go... away.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
your sister gave me very strict orders.
so I'm going to sit here with you until you fall asleep.
okay?
hmm. Smells good.
you sure you don't want a bite?
Chris, can you get the butter out of the fridge?
Yeah.
so you're not coming to my karate match?
buddy, I told you, I got this event with the Vice President.
I'm sorry.
Chris, we talked about this, right?
your dad'll go to the next one.
right? - Right.
all right, dinner's ready. Everybody, sit down.
whose turn is it to say grace?
mine.
dad, do you know how to do it?
I think I can fake it.
dear God, bless this food to thy use and our lives to thy service.
and may you shine the light of your love on this family...
hold them close...
and protect them always.
Amen. - Amen.
how did I do? - Not bad.
the end of our lives is preordained.
we are not created for no reason.
we are only finding the path we are meant to walk on.
so, purify your soul.
forget about the physical world.
and take the time left to offer good deeds and obedience.
all of life's wasted time is behind you now.
and the way forward is clear.
you were looking at the battle before you engaged in it, and now you see it with your own eyes.
dad? What are you doing?
what's going on?
how long have you been standing there?
dad, you're scaring me.
don't be scared.
was that Arabic? - Yeah.
what does it mean?
it means, um...
I converted to Islam.
I didn't say anything to anyone, because I didn't want to upset you guys.
well, then, it's a good thing you didn't shoot a deer, or step out on mom, or beat the shit out of Mike.
okay, I deserved that.
why do you wash your hands and feet like that?
it's a ritual.
it's about purifying your mind and body before presenting yourself to God.
does Mom know anything about any of this?
no.
she wouldn't get it...at all.
our little secret then?
Yeah.
day2
these are the kind of issues facing Vice President Walden this morning as he prepares to give his remarks.
the vice president will be joined by staunch supporters from virtually every corner of the defense establishment, including the Secretaries of Defense and State and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, longtime advisor Elizabeth Gaines.
the speech comes just days after a bombing in downtown Washington
yet, the exact nature of those measures remain unclear.
taking a more militarized approach to intelligence gathering, and the elimination of insurgents.
Virgil, where are my pills? I need them!
vice President Walden has met with political resistance...
I'm right here.
here. Here.
I need to get out of here.
good. Uh, great.
we'll go for a walk, huh?
I want to go for a drive.
what are you doing here? You're supposed to be at the State Department.
I need your help with something first.
what is that?
there's an 11-month gap in Abu Nazir's activities.
started around two years ago.
he goes silent like he fell off the face of the earth.
theory is, there might have been some event that precipitated this, something that hit him personally, took him out of action for a while.
and whose theory is that?
just look at this.
it's all redacted. What the hell am I looking at?
I think it's a drone strike.
Why's that?
this reference number here.
how'd you find this?
grid search.
cross-referenced with Abu Nazir's likely locations around the time in question...
and I got hundreds of hits.
none like this.
can I ask why you were even doing that?
I told you, there's a gap.
this gap-- is it related to that wall of garbage we found in Carrie's apartment?
it was a time line, David.
it was classified material, Saul, improperly removed from this office, assembled by a crazy woman into a crazy collage, and I don't even want to know about your involvement in it.
well, ask me.
I'll tell you. - I said I don't even want to know.
I need you too much right now to have you land in custody.
I, I need you to do your job.
I think I am.
you're not.
the vice president is hosting a highly visible conference today.
I asked you to be our man on the ground there.
go do it.
this is good.
Excellent-- I can't feel my hands.
we ought to sic him on Tom Walker.
okay, let's go. - This is good.
we're going to be late.
sure you don't want to come?
well, I want to.
then do. - Come on, guys, we settled this already.
next time.
sure.
Hey, come on.
come on, Bruce Lee, you're going to miss your bout.
you got everything? - Yeah.
we're gonna be late. I'll see you later.
the turn's right up here.
just going for a little drive, huh?
we're driving, aren't we? - Yeah.
great.
you want to tell me what the hell we're doing here?
getting some fresh air.
no, I'm serious,
I have a van full of equipment, a lot of it not exactly legal.
so why are we here?
Carrie. - In a few hours, the vice president is expected to announce he's a candidate for President.
okay.
up ahead in that building he'll be surrounded by his entire team.
I said why are we here?
half the government is going to be in one spot and we've got a terrorist on the loose.
and you think this is the target.
I think it's worth considering.
okay, Carrie, look, first of all, we don't have a terrorist on the loose.
we don't have anything. You see these guys?
they have a terrorist on the loose and it's their job to do something about it.
it's my job.
not anymore it's not. - It'll always be my job.
don't you get that?
look around, Carrie.
there is security up the wazoo here.
they are on it. We are not needed.
no, all those guys?
they're thinking it's a single sniper.
because that's what it is.
no, it's not. It doesn't make sense.
Virgil, I...
I know I'm not wanted.
I know it's just us in this stupid van, but I'm the same person I've always been and I need you to be on my side now.
I need you to say yes.
okay.
come on, you got to back it out. Let's go.
sorry.
made a wrong turn.
find a place to park this thing.
just a minute.
the door's locked.
I'm getting dressed.
dad, I really don't think you should go to this thing today.
this thing...
is being hosted by the vice president.
so?
so...
he's counting on me.
to be there.
well, all they're saying on TV is how intense the security is.
most since the inauguration-- that's what they're saying.
well, that's all taken care of. We have nothing to worry about.
I guess.
dad.
what?
have you noticed how awkward it is, having this conversation through the door?
I think I heard my car arrive.
you let 'em know I'll be a couple minutes?
seeing you praying like that last night, I think it kind of freaked me out.
apparently. - As if it's not enough that Tom Walker is running around out there with a gun.
you're safe.
don't worry.
it's not me that I'm worried about.
I'll be fine. Two minutes.
I still think that you should stay here.
be good.
sergeant Brody.
who are you? - Kandarian.
secret Service.
I've been assigned to you for the day.
let's go.
saul Berenson found a redacted document that points to the mission.
I thought that paper trail was burned.
you and me both.
what was he even looking for?
he was just fishing - Based on what? - Some theory he has that the current situation is blowback.
you tell him it doesn't matter why terrorists do what they do.
I have. - He's a security expert, he's not a fucking social worker
I know, I told him to drop it.
don't tell him; Make it happen.
this cannot get out.
right?
operation wasn't above my security clearance It was off the books, or it was taken off after the fact.
Yeah, well, you're right.
the reference number implies a drone strike.
so there's got to be all kinds of supporting documentation, yes?
that's the weird thing-- there's not.
you check flight plans? - Yeah.
what about ops tapes?
I went down and checked the vault myself.
the only thing that exists is this redacted document you found on the grid search.
it probably wasn't even supposed to be there.
obviously.
I'm stuck here like some school crossing guard just so Estes can feel like his ass is covered.
you want me to initiate an official request for information?
I have a feeling that's the last thing we want to do.
I could reach out to some drone pilots.
sir.
no, let's not raise flags.
I'll follow up on it myself.
so what are we looking for exactly?
exactly I don't know.
it's not one thing, Virgil, it's everything.
all the Defense leaders will be here--at least two dozen high-value targets.
Yeah, so?
so a single sniper is not gonna take them all out.
so you focus on the highest value target.
but why here with all the security?
that's exactly what I've been saying.
you attack here if you're planning to take them all out.
a group of people who are almost never in the same place at the same time.
I'd really rather talk about this conference and our need to rededicate our efforts to the war on terror.
is that a course that the vice president would pursue as commander in chief?
he'll be here shortly; you can ask him yourself.
but the fact is, we are not comfortable with a war...
we're on the wrong side of the barrier, Virgil.
I agree. Now, come on. Let's go home.
Carrie, you are working yourself up for nothing.
I wouldn't call a possible terrorist attack nothing.
you can't say stuff like that. Not here.
don't worry, everything's fine.
is that what you want to hear?
it's a bit excessive, isn't it, all this security?
windows open, please.
ids?
sergeant Brody.
sure.
sorry about the inconvenience.
good to go!
Brody? What's he doing here?
uh, do me a favor. Don't ask him.
I'm standing here because of him. I lost my job because of him.
Carrie, we really should go now.
goddamn it, Carrie.
nervous? - Well...
I'll be standing in there with...
two cabinet secretaries, couple of joint chiefs, head of Defense Intelligence.
I'm just a platoon sergeant.
you'll get used to it.
he's here.
sergeant Brody. - Sir.
Congratulations. - Thank you, sir.
ms. Gaines, nice to see you again.
Mr. Vice President.
thanks for coming out. - Thank you for having me, sir.
we have to get out of here. Come on! Come on!
thank you. - You're welcome.
nicholas Brody. - Richard Halstead, I'm...
secretary of Defense. Believe me, I know who you are.
what a fuck up.
Where's the vice president?
who knows?
Where's the vice president? - He's all right. He's just right behind us.
Berenson. - It's me, Saul.
I-I got to call you back.- No!
Carrie, we've got a situation.- I-I-I know, I'm here.
saul, you have to listen to me.
what do you mean, you're here?
I saw the whole thing. The woman that was hit, Elizabeth Gaines, she is not the target.
vice president was the target. Walker missed.
Walker would not have missed once, never mind three times!
this is... this is just stage one. The real attack has not come yet.
what real attack? What are you talking about?
following an assassination attempt, they'll sequester the high value targets, that's protocol.
right now, they're putting the vice president and his team out of sight, in a single, small space.
they're supposed to be safe there, but they're not. They're vulnerable.
how?
Brody. - Brody?
for Christ's sake, Carrie, not this again.
forget about before; This is now.
I saw him-- Brody.
they hustled him right through the metal detectors along with the vice president.
you even realize what you're saying?
Yes! He's planning on taking them all out.
that is what's coming!
we've been hearing chatter for days now, Marine One, Marine Two.
I-I-it's not the President's helicopter.
it's actual marines-- Brody and Walker.
they are Marine One and Marine Two. They're working together, they must be.
saul, you hear me? - Yeah, I do.
that's why Brody ratted me out,'cause I was getting too close.
God, it finally all makes sense. - Yeah, sure.
saul, you got to get me in there.
there's a CT Officer named Benton.- I-I-I know him.
I'll send him out for you.
Thanks. Hurry. - Yeah, bye.
there's a woman outside the building, one of ours.
she's unstable, and you need to contain her.
her name's Carrie Mathison.
I'm not getting stuck down here for a day and a half.
that won't happen, sir. - I won't run and hide, you understand?
no one's asking that, just a little caution.
get your hands off me. - My apologies.
fuck your caution.
one of my closest friends just got shot. - All right, I understand.
may I have your attention please.
we've initiated a full lockdown protocol for your protection.
that means this door will now remain closed until one of two things happen.
one, the sniper's apprehended, or, two, we establish to our satisfaction that he's left the vicinity, and it's safe to leave the room.
you fucking believe this?
you're safe, sir. That's the priority.
safe from what?
we look like a bunch of idiots.
well, you're my advisers.
how about some advice? How about some fucking advice?
how do we spin this?
there is nothing left to think about.
clench your teeth. Say the holy words.
remember Issa.
I advise we wait, like the man said.
there a men's room here? There better be.
where is he? There's no time.
wait. - Oh, there he is.
whoa, whoa, whoa, I said wait.
what's with all the backup?
damn you, Saul.
Virgil, am I crazy? - Look, you know you are.
no, I mean about Brody. Just tell me if I am.
Virgil, I need to know!
I don't know, okay? But I trust you.
I need your keys. - Where are you going?
you don't want to know. - All right, go. I'll run interference.
hey which one of you guys is Benton?
are you Benton?
which one of you is Benton?
any word out there?
no. - Well, they said this could happen.
you okay? You look a little peaked.
well, not a fan of being locked up, I guess.
you've reenergized him, you know.
sir?
Walden. He sees you as a living, breathing vindication of everything he's ever done.
he's got big plans for you.
wouldn't you know it, no paper towels.
another fuck up.
Oh, come on.
massive search for the sniper is now underway in the area between E Street and Independence Avenue all the way from the Potomac to 17th...
I'm coming!
no one is going in or out.
eyewitnesses say the vice president and his supporters...
my God.
Oh, my God. Yeah? What?
what are you doing here?
you're Dana, right? - Yeah.
I'm Carrie Mathison. - I know who you are.
it's about your dad.
was he hit? - No.
I saw on the TV...- No. I-I know. I was there.
I saw it happen. He wasn't shot. But, Dana, I need your help. Can I come inside?
you heard about Tom Walker? - Yeah.
how he was turned against us? - Yeah.
did he shoot those people? - Yes.
Dana, listen to me. Your dad told me that you are the one who understands him, who he listens to.
and this is very hard to say, but your dad is working with Tom Walker.
they're working together. They are carrying out an attack right now.
what are you talking about?
he is with the vice president and other innocent people.
he is going to kill them if we don't stop them.
okay, you have to call him and just talk him down.
all right?
this will get you to the Secret Service. That'll connect you.
we don't have much time.
you can do this, Dana.
okay.
Hi. Um, I'm at 3319 Chapman, and it's... it's emergency.
there's... there's an insane woman...
No! No! Dana!
get out! - Dana, please. Get back inside!
get out of my house! - Dana, please, get back inside.
get out! Please! - Dana, please. Get back inside!
get out of my house! - Dana! You must have noticed.
leave me alone! - Something strange, him acting off.
no, you're off! - Just call him and make sure.
something is wrong with you!
God! Why are you even here?! - I told you! So that we can stop him.
who's that with Dana?
stay in the car. - Leave me alone.
Mom...Mom... - What's going on?
She-she came here and she says that Dad is working with Tom Walker!
get in the house. Call the police, right now. - I already did.
Dana? Dana, please. Please call him.
get away from her! - Jessica, listen...
what are you doing telling some crazy story to my daughter? - No, it's not crazy.
he has intentions to kill the vice president and his staff. You have to believe me.
believe you? - It's not too late to stop him.
I told Dana she needs to call him...
you fucked my husband. - And now you need to call him.
he tells you to get lost, and-and now you're...
making up all those crazy shit. - No, you're not listening to me.
of course I'm not listening to you.
please, just call him. You really don't want this happening.
are we okay here? - No, we're not okay.
okay, please. You don't understand what's going on, any of you!
ma'am... - Okay, the world is about to end, and we're standing around talking!
ma'am, come with us. - No! Get... get off of me!
come with us! Come on! - Get off of me!
do not move! Stay down!
stay... stay there.
you okay in there?
Yeah, fine.
we found the shooter's weapon abandoned in an apartment a block away.
it shouldn't be too much longer, we'll have you all out of there.
great.
you sure you're okay? - I'm feeling a little sick, actually.
if you need a doctor or anything? - No. No, thanks. That won't be necessary.
sergeant Brody.
I got a call for you, from your daughter.
she says it's an emergency.
Dana? - Dad... where are you?
Dana, I got to call you back. - No, Dad, no.
there was... there was this crazy woman at our house, the one that... that, you know, you were with, and... she was saying all these things about you, and I just... I had to hear your voice.
dad?
dad?
Yeah. Yeah, but, Dana, I...
dad, she said that you were working with Tom Walker, that-that you're a terrorist.
I'm not. - I know, Dad, I know. Of course you're not.
I-I wouldn't have believed her, because you would never do anything like that, ever. Ever.
I didn't believe her at all.
Dana, I'm here with a group of people. Look, I've got to go.
no, Dad, don't.
we're just, uh, we're in a holding area, and, um, you know, they're about to let us out.
so you're coming home? - Sure.
tell me that.
Yeah, I'm coming home.
no, Dad, don't say it like that.
Dad...promise me.
you have to promise me that you're coming home, Dad.
dad?
dad, you have to promise me.
I need you. You know that.
I'm coming home, Dana.
I promise.
okay. Thank you.
copy.
all right, we're clear. We're clear.
Nick...you look like shit.
come on. What a fuckin' day.
day 3
our thoughts and prayers go out to her family...as does this pledge:
her murder will not go unpunished.
for this reason...
I stand before you today to officially announce my intention to run for President of the United States, and to rededicate myself and this nation...
Yes, of course. Yes. Anytime.
that was the police.
they want to know if we want to press charges.
Brody, are you listening to me?
what did you tell them? - That I would talk to you.
I'll take care of it.
this woman is sick.
there's something seriously wrong with this woman.
so whatever you decide...
I don't want to ever hear her name in this house again.
I said I'll take care of it! - Good.
I'm gonna go see if Dana's doing better.
Saul. - Mr. Vice President.
give us, uh, five minutes?
let's make it ten, be on the safe side. - Ten.
how's Mira? - Oh, great. Thanks.
now that you and David Estes handle about this mess?
what are you playing at, Saul?
I called it fuck the terrorists.
I remember where you are. - I know exactly where I am, sir.
are we on the same side?
because your tone suggests otherwise.
trying to find out about what happened yesterday, why.
trying to stop it from happening again.
and you think this redacted file will help you to do that?
I can't let anyone see that until I see what's under all those black lines.
trust me, Saul, this is nothing but a turd. Let it lie.
you're my boss for 3 and a half years, did I ever once let anything lie?
I'm saying this would be a good time to start.
I don't agree.
here's another thing you might remember about me,
I'm a sentimentalist,
I like to hold on to things. For old time sake.
if I ever told the American people these interrogation tapes had been destroyed I was mistaken.
coercion, cruelty, all right, torture.
makes for a very unhappy viewing.
you gave the orders William, I gave the orders.
you're blackmailing me.
you'll stay with us.
the girls have fixed up the room for you,
they'll have you on the flowers. They are very excited.
thank you, Maggie.
I told them that you need to rest but not, you know, why exactly.
did you know he was here?
Carrie, what are you doing?
there are criminal charges pending, you shouldn't talk to him.
I have to.
Brody, I am...
you broke into my house.
you terrified my daughter.
she's 16 years old, by the way, sixteen.
I'm sorry.
they asked me what I wanted to do about it, the police did.
what did you tell them? - Nothing yet.
that'll depend on you.
for the last time, Carrie,
I am not what you think I am.
I'm sorry. - You keep saying that, it is not enough.
I know about your condition, David Estes told me.
Carrie, you need to get some help.
I am.
and you need to stay away from me. And from my family.
you set up surveillance, you watched me, you pushed your way into my life, and for what?
okay. - Fun?
it's crazy what you did.
you understand... - I said okay.
what does that mean?
I understand.
I'll stay away from you, you have my word.
goodbye Brody.
goodbye Carrie.
home now?
to the hospital.
Oh, fuck.
it's Abu Nazir in the target area.
we believe... - You sure wanna see this?
what you've been hiding from me? Yeah, I do.
80% certain he was here.
in terms of collateral damage.
but impossible in the time frame.
that's a school sir.
don't the issue.
if Abu Nazir is taking refuge among children he is putting them at risk, not us.
so, we agree?
good to go.
it's our joint opinion the potential collateral damage falls within current matrix parameters.
and, uh...Someone actually came up with that language.
that was 2 years ago, you reported to me at that time and you said nothing.
because you would have stopped it.
Yeah, none of this would have happened.
no dead children, no cover up, no Carrie Mathison drawn out of the agency...
keep her out of this.
you know what I think, when she got a lead on Nazir, first one in over seven years, wasn't it worth mentioning this strong string?
even in private to me.
or is your career on the of the vice president?
national security.
really, I'm fascinated to know.
the world changed, Saul. Right under your nose.
answer the damn question. - I am.
we're about projecting American power now, degrading Al-Qaeda militarily.
you wanna play soft ball spy games, go join the Germans or the French.
I am this fucking close to picking up the phone, and calling the New York Times.
no, you're not.
you know why?
because telling the world we killed 82 kids on purpose, would endanger every one of your case officers in the field.
not to mention every American soldier on the ground.
you would, essentially, be handling the enemy the biggest recruitment tool since Abu Ghraib.
I gotta say I am impressed. You've got the balls to show up.
I'm impressed you're alive. Care to explain?
we all went to the same place, Nick,
I just got out of there a lot quicker.
now, you wanna tell me what happened yesterday?
I don't answer to you, Tom! And I didn't come in here to make excuses.
what the fuck happened?
I came here because you got a direct line to Nazir.
fuck Nazir!
my vest malfunctioned, okay? - Bullshit!
you fucking panicked!
maybe what happened yesterday was a good thing.
what if I had detonated that vest?
what would be different?
ask yourself that.
today, they would've just replaced Walden with somebody else.
so the fuck what?
so, that means I'm close to the next president of the United States, Tom.
that puts me in a unique position.
Nazir? You listened to this garbage, Nazir?
I'm listening.
what do you want me to do?
put Nicholas on the phone.
Nazir? - Is it true what you say?
Yes, I hit the switch but nothing happened.
I meant about the vice-president.
Yes, it's true.
at the very least,
I'd be able to influence policy at the highest levels.
why kill a man when you can kill an idea?
that's what I'm thinking.
Nazir, are you still there?
I want to believe what you say, but to help me believe
I need a demonstration of your commitment.
name it.
you did it once or at least you were told you did, uh?
there is a wild card in this new play.
you understand what I'm saying? Nicholas?
Yeah, I understand.
then say goodbye. Tell Walker I need to speak to him privately.
wants to talk to you.
it's done.
you got a million calls while you were out.
presidency office and vice president's office, too.
you okay?
Yeah, better.
and, Jess, I'm sorry that I shouted at you before.
it's okay.
I'm surprised you're keeping it together at all.
thank you.
for what? - Everything.
two DAYS LATER
excuse me, sir? Excuse me, sir!
I'm sorry sir, this is locked ward. - I've got my pass here somewhere.
here, for preop.
it's across the hall on the right.
what did you say? Thank you. - On the right, second door.
just a little sting.
how are you feeling, honey? - Fine.
take that thing out of her arm. - Saul.
sir... - Out of my way.
this is fucking barbaric. I won't allow it.
Jim! - I'm getting you out of here.
saul, stop.
just listen to me. This was...
I wanna do this thing.
what? - It was my decision, I told them to go ahead.
your decision? Have a shock treatment?
it's not, Saul. They use ultra brief impulses now.
it's called electrocomplusive therapy. - I don't care what is called.
they still attached electrodes to your skull, don't they?
still jilting into a seizure?
I need to do something. I can't take this anymore.
Yes, you can.
you're the strongest person I know.
so pass.
no, it won't pass.
it's only getting worse...
Carrie, please, there's alternatives to this.
you don't have to let them fuck with your brain.
my brain's already fucked.
yeah? It is a brain I happen to love.
is everything okay, Ms. Mathison?
everything's fine, thanks, yes, really. - You sure?
what about the side effects? Memory loss...
that is only short time.
it's usually temporary.
a lot was happening anyway.
that's not even remotely funny.
saul, I made up my mind.
I'm grateful for the concern but I just...
I can't live like this any more. It needs to stop.
Yeah.
well...
you shouldn't feel all bad.
I mean...It hasn't been an unmitigated disaster.
you were wrong about Brody.
and you were right about Nazir.
you're telling me the yellow, his period of dormancy?
Yes. He was in mourning.
his son died in a drone strike in northern Iraq.
which son? - Youngest, 10 years old.
along with 82 of his classmates.
apparently the vice president gave the order.
how on Earth did I miss that?
you didn't.
record's been wiped white clean. Expunged.
like it never happened.
thanks for telling me.
you deserved to know.
so, Saul, is there any change that I can appeal on my termination?
no.
dad!
what you're doing up here?
came up to fix the leak in the skyline.
is it beer?
that came later.
never knew it had views.
back yard, nice.
do you mind if I join you? - No, of course not.
you're ready?
this is the anesthetic I was telling you about.
I want you to start counting backwards from 100.
issa, no!
issa, Nazir's son Brody knew him.
saul, don't let me fucking forget...
what did she say?
nothing, it's the anesthetic, everyone does it.
she's asleep.
OK, we're ready.
paddles on...
what did you say?
I'm an American.
it turns out he's one of ours.
marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody, MIA since early 2003 and presumed dead...
until now.
Hi, Dad.
did you ever meet him? - Abu Nazir?
was he ever present during any of your interrogations?
no.
so Abu Nazir's resurfacing just as Brody's miraculously returned home means nothing?
dad...
if he is a terrorist, we need eyes an ears on Brody from the minute he steps off that plane.
Oh, I'm sorry. - Hey, I know you.
Hey, look, I'm not going back in if it means you can't go back in.
that's not necessary.
maybe we can hold our own private meeting out here. How's that sound?
it's tempting.
how about your wife?
I can't be with her, but I can with you.
the fucking CIA thinks I'm working for Al-Qaeda?
I think you're working for Al-Qaeda.
I was broken, living in the dark for years, and a man walked in.
and he was kind to me.
and you became his follower?
for the last time, Carrie, I am not what you think I am.
I pray every day that you never lose sight of what you committed to do in Issa's name.
the switch is here.
wait until the last second before you open it.
I read that part of the blast goes upward toward here
point of weakness.
there is a bigger, pernicious, Abu Nazir - worthy plot out there, and we have little time.
we have to code it, collide it, collapse it, contain it.
she's bipolar. She's stable on her meds.
why didn't she ever tell me? - She said no one at work could know.
your office at Langley is being cleared as we speak.
I am about to solve this fucking thing.
what are you doing here?
it's about your dad. - Was he hit?
he is with the vice president and other innocent people.
he is going to kill them if we don't stop them.
okay, the world is about to end and we're standing around, talking!
do not move.
saul, you have to listen to me.
the woman that was hit - she is not the target.
right now they're putting the vice president and his team in a single small space.
they're supposed to be safe there but they're not. They're vulnerable.
say the holy words. Remember Issa.
got a call for you from your daughter.
Dana, I got to call you back.
no, Dad, no, there was this crazy woman at our house.
dad, she said that you're a terrorist.
you have to promise me that you're coming home, Dad.
I'm coming home, Dana.
I know about your condition. You need to get some help.
I am.
and you need to stay away from me.
good-bye, Brody.
I can't live like this anymore. It needs to stop.
what about the side effects - memory loss?
saul, I've made up my mind.
countering criticism from the international community, the Israeli government continues to defend its successful bombing of five Iranian nuclear facilities.
demonstrators held protests outside of U. S. embassies over the American government's support of Israel.
I told you to turn it off.
idf spokesman Yigal Nitzani called Iran's claim of 3, 000 casualties "a gross exaggeration meant to stir international outrage...
dad. - ...against Israel in its...
it's not like she doesn't know what's going on over there.
of course she does. But why wave it in her face?
I mean, she's finally gotten to a good place.
depends how you define good.
what do you mean? - I think her lithium levels are too high.
that is for her and Dr. Rosenberg to decide.
when mine were too high, I couldn't read for six months.
stay out of it.
puttering around in that stupid garden like your mother used to do.
morning, guys. - Hey, want some pancakes?
no, thanks. - You sure?
Yeah, I've got a bunch of exams to grade before class, and, Dad, you can turn the TV back on now.
what did I tell you?
beirut, Lebanon
you said a woman gave this to our cutout.
you didn't say who.
that's the thing, sir, we don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
she contacted us with a priority three code intelligence about an attack on U. S. interests.
someone in this station must be running her.
except no one has any idea who she is.
we were hoping you might. Let me show you.
I've never seen her before.
well, she wants a face-to- face at one of our designated dead drops.
when? - In two hours.
get the car ready. You're gonna drop me outside.
sir, the last unconfirmed asset we trusted blew himself up with five of our officers.
shouldn't we work our sources, find out who she is first?
two days ago Israel bombed five nuclear sites deep inside Iran.
ayatollahs are not amused.
they have climbed into their minbars, vowed to retaliate against the West.
you're saying it's not a coincidence this woman comes forward now.
I'm saying it's not a coincidence we can ignore.
I'll get the car.
I think we got company.
you'd think they'd at least change out their follow car.
why are you running away?
I came here 'cause you wanted to talk.
you are confusing me with someone else.
I don't think so.
you said you had information about an attack.
no, Aaron, that's not what I'm saying.
I've just been trying to get some sort of conformation.
well, get him on the phone.
sir. - Morning, Betsy.
who? - The Vice President.
Mr. Vice President. - Congressman.
I understand the wives are becoming fast friends.
Oh, Mrs. Walden's been great, sir.
getting Dana and Chris into school, helping with their scholarships.
well, that's what Cynthia does. Now it's our turn.
sir? - Build some mutual trust.
within the hour, my campaign is going to float your name as a potential running mate on the ticket.
assuming you're interested, of course.
are you're serious? This is for real?
we've got a long way to go to the convention, and there's other hats in the ring, but I believe you're the future of the party.
so I'll ask you again. Are you interested?
hell, yes.
that's the answer I was looking for the first time!
understood, sir. Thank you.
there is one other thing.
I had you vetted by my search committee, background checked by the FBI.
turned you inside out.
what did we miss, Nick?
what flaw in your character, what deep abiding secret?
I need to know. I need to know now.
I've been in a Taliban hole, sir, for eight years.
I didn't get much of a chance to misbehave.
fair enough, but here's what people are gonna say about that.
you were a prisoner a long time. Too long.
you're damaged goods.
you really want me to respond to that?
you can hit a curveball. That's good.
expect my office to send over a preliminary schedule.
first up are the Sunday talk shows.
I'm also arranging an intelligence briefing.
I want you prepped for the inevitable questions about the crisis in the Middle East.
I appreciate that, sir. - And good luck.
nice work, Hana. - Thank you.
you, too, Hakem.
almost perfect, Omar.
watch out for the extra pronoun, though.
it's not: "Those are the sunglasses I want to buy them."
it's: "Those are the sunglasses I want to buy."
those are the sunglasses I want to buy.
good.
I'll be right back.
excuse me.
what do you want? - How are you, Carrie?
I'm fine.
Hey, I'm sorry I never stopped by the hospital. I always meant to.
don't worry about it. I wasn't exactly having a party.
what do you want?
Estes needs to see you.
tell him to fuck off.
don't you even want to know what this is about?
no.
come on, Carrie. What am I supposed to tell him?
tell him he was right.
tell him I never belonged in CIA in the first place.
sorry, everybody.
uh, yes, Omar?
uh, he wasn't anybody.
he's on the short list. That's all we really know right now.
uh, Senator Laughton, I think?
no, no, I mean, it's all good.
we're just in a complete state of shock over here.
listen, Jean, I have to go, but thanks for calling, and please thank Martin. Bye.
the phone has been ringing all day.
you would not believe who's coming out of the woodwork.
guess how many friend requests I got today?
how many? - Three hundred.
that's a lot of friends.
Chris, please tell Dana that your father's home.
Dana! - And please don't yell. Just go get her.
my God, Brody, Vice President of the United States?
let's not get carried away. Walden's just floating my name.
they said you didn't have enough experience to be Walden's running mate.
I don't.
I think he's just using my name to help sell the public on taking a harder line with Iran.
still, just the fact that he's mentioning your name in public.
that's pretty incredible. - Well.
after everything you've been through.
everything we've all been through.
Hey, you sure you want this?
you know, being a member of Congress is...
it wouldn't be easy on the family. I get that, but I'd be lying if I said this hasn't been fun.
I'll be back in, like, an hour.
do you have anything you want to say to your father?
Congratulations.
thank you. Where are you going?
dinner. - With who?
can you speak up, please? - Xander.
how come you never go out with friends from your new school?
because I don't have any friends at my new school.
are you done interrogating me?
it's okay.
her attitude sucks. - Yeah, she's 16.
when I was 16, I was working two jobs, saving money for junior college.
yeah? I was repeating my sophomore year in high school.
you were, weren't you? - Oh, yeah.
Carrie, where have you been? I've been trying you and trying you.
how come you didn't answer your phone? - I turned it off.
saul Berenson's been calling all afternoon.
did he say what he wanted?
no. Just that it's important he speak to you.
Hello? - Saul, it's me.
thanks for getting back.
I'm guessing this isn't a social call. - No.
what's going on? - I can't talk.
we're on an open line, but we need your help.
I know. I hate myself for even asking.
well, can't it wait until tomorrow?
I'm afraid not.
david Estes is sitting outside your house right now.
well, tonight is Thursday. I cook dinner for the family on Thursdays.
I'm making vegetable lasagna with vegetables I picked this morning from the garden.
don't make me talk to him, Saul.
I don't ever want to see him again. I've put all of that away.
please, Carrie.
God, why are you doing this to me?!
I want you to know, Carrie, this is much appreciated.
just get it over with, okay?
there's a photo inside I'd like you to take a look at.
do you recognize her?
Yeah. I recognize her. Why?
who is she?
Fatima Ali, first wife of Abbas Ali.
the Hezbollah district commander. How do you know her?
I recruited her, that's how.
yet there's no record of her ever being an agent of yours.
well, I ran her off book. - Why?
because I was interested in keeping her alive.
our networks there were blown, if you remember.
it was right around the time we lost Garrett Hedges.
how did you make your approach to her?
carefully, over a matter of months.
I first spotted her at the Acadamie des Beaux-Arts.
she had a weakness for American movies. She loved Julia Roberts.
and did she turn out to be a valuable asset?
I was transferred to Baghdad before I had a chance to find out.
so your last contact with her was when?
march, 2005. It was right before I left Beirut.
I was trying to farm her out to another case officer.
And? - She wouldn't go for it.
she said I was the only one she could trust.
so she's been a dead agent ever since? - As far as I know, yeah.
well, apparently, she came back to life yesterday, and with information about an attack on America.
tell me.
unfortunately, that's all I know. - Well, what do you mean?
well, she's refusing to speak to anybody but you.
look, Carrie, I,uh, hear you're doing well, making good progress...
David, I've had a long day.
if you're gonna ask me to go to Beirut, just ask me already.
you'll be back in three days.
we just need you to go meet with your asset, find out what she knows.
after all the shit you dragged me through?
the unceremonious humiliating way you ran me out of the agency?
I didn't come here to open old wounds, and just so we're clear, this isn't you getting your job back.
this is you being a good citizen.
just so we're clear, I haven't said yes yet.
Carrie, please, this is crazy.
believe me, I wouldn't be going if I had a choice.
you do have a choice. You always have a choice.
not-not this time.
Carrie, you're just starting to get back on your feet.
you're not ready for this. - Don't you think I know that?
regular sleep and meals, avoiding stress, a schedule.
these are the things that have been working so well for you.
at least call Dr. Rosenberg before you make a decision.
I've already decided.
I don't understand how you can trust these people for one minute after what they did to you.
I trust Saul.
he'll be there to hold my hand, and it's only for a few days.
you say this is about patriotism, but we both know that's not the whole story.
part of you wants to do this.
let her go, Maggie.
I'm worried she's gonna wind up back in the hospital.
let her go.
Thanks, Dad.
be safe, sweetheart.
Carrie Mathison, Major Joy Mendez; she'll be traveling with you to Cyprus.
I'll take your bag, ma'am. - Thank you, Major.
call me Joy. - If you don't call me ma'am.
come in.
Roya Hammad is doing a story on veepstakes.
she wants 15 minutes of your time.
when? - Now.
she was just down the hall in Senator Laughton's office.
she's waiting outside.
all right, bring her in.
Hi, Roya. - Congressman Brody.
please.
you want me in on this or... - Uh, no, I'll be fine.
so...
so, been an extraordinary couple of days, wouldn't you say?
depends. - On what?
on whether or not I actually have a shot at the nomination.
well, Senator Laughton thinks you do, and he's not too happy about it.
but that's not why I'm here.
congressman, do you tape what's said in this office?
do you have any hidden recording devices or video cameras?
no. Why do you ask?
because we need to speak privately.
Oh, you mean off the record?
I mean privately.
about Abu Nazir.
he sends his best regards.
excuse me?
relax, Congressman. I'm a friend.
friend of whose? I'm sorry. I have no idea what you're talking about.
of Nazir's.
our families have been close since 1947.
they were refugees from Palestine together.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now.
Issa's birthday is Monday.
he would have been 13 had he survived the drone strike.
do you remember what you gave him for his tenth birthday?
he was scared of the big, black crows that perched on the villa walls.
you made him a slingshot.
what do you want?
it's want Nazir want-- your help.
my help? - Yes.
david Estes is briefing you tomorrow morning on homeland security.
there's a safe in his office containing the encryption key to a database of potential targets.
the code to Estes' safe.
if you need these, you must be planning to hit one of these targets.
I told Nazir I would influence lawmakers through my access.
that is what I'm doing, and that is what we agreed to.
I know what you agreed to.
I am not a terrorist.
there's a difference between terrorism and a justifiable act of retaliation.
I will not help you in the killing of innocent civilians.
what about the 3, 000 civilians Israel just killed in Iran?
everybody knows those numbers are bullshit.
the point is blatant aggression against a sovereign nation cannot go unanswered.
even if I agreed...
if I agreed to do this,
I can't open Estes' safe while he's in the office.
you'll have your chance.
Nicholas, we're at war. You need to choose sides.
abu Nazir knows which side I'm on. I killed Tom Walker.
and I'm sure some part of you hoped it would end there.
if your allegiance is truly with us, this is your chance to prove it.
contact me when you have the target list.
I couldn't sleep last night.
all I could think about was Israel bombing Iran to try to stop Iran from bombing them.
the whole logic of that just makes me want to scream.
I think maybe the whole human race is insane.
I think sometimes military force is necessary.
I mean, the Iranian president keeps saying he wants to wipe Israel off the map, so...
they have every right to defend themselves.
plus the Arab religion doesn't value human life the way we do.
I mean, we're the infidel, right?
and these Arabs believe if they kill us, they get to go to heaven.
and we're supposed to let...
they're not Arabs.
iranians aren't Arabs, they're Persians.
Dana, I realize you're new here, but Quaker meeting has rules.
the main one is to remain silent between statements so we can each contemplate what's been said and what we want to say.
you can speak when Tad sits.
persians, Arabs, what's the difference?
they both want the same thing, which is to annihilate us.
why shouldn't we hit them first?
maybe with a nuke or two of our own.
douche.
did she just call me a douche?
we don't tolerate name-calling.
and what about mass murder? Do we tolerate that?
I mean, because that's what he's really saying, isn't it?
he was just talking.
he's talking about turning Tehran into a parking lot.
Dana, that's enough.
who do you think you are and what do you know about any of this anyways?
what do you know?
well, what if I told you my dad is undersecretary of state?
Yeah, well, what if I told you my dad's a Muslim?
right, and mine's a Scientologist.
all right. That's enough.
CIA SAFEHOUSE, NICOSIA, CYPRUS
okay, Carrie, this is the last one.
one, two, three.
spell it. -Two Rs, two Ss, and an EY.
mother's maiden name?
hold on, I know this one.
it's DeCarlo.
can we start again?
sure.
my name is Kate Morrissey. I was born on October 16, 1981.
where?
uh, in Ottawa at the Queensway Carlton Hospital.
but you grew up in...
Calgary.
the hockey team there is...
I don't follow hockey.
you do if you live in Calgary.
the Flames.
mother's maiden name?
fuck. Fuck.
it's DeCarlo.
right, DeCarlo, um, like the olive oil.
want to take a break?
I think I want to go home.
I understand, and you will be home in a short 72 hours.
when's my meet with Saul again?
we're still working on it.
instructions will be waiting for you when you get to your hotel room.
at the Commodore.
correct.
you fly commercially into Rafic-Hariri tomorrow afternoon, you grab a cab downtown, and you check into the Commodore.
what's wrong?
I don't eat meat.
good, you're home.
Why? What is it?
her dean called today.
something the three of us need to talk about.
Dana, get in here now.
I'm coming. You don't have to yell.
so your dean called?
you want to tell him?
no, go ahead. I mean, you obviously know everything...
she got into a fight.
it wasn't a fight. - At morning meeting.
I didn't start anything. Just a couple of morons that...
they are not morons.
actually, yeah, they are.
Finn Walden was one of them, the vice president's son.
see? Look, she is just terrified of causing any sort of trouble with Mrs. Walden, her new best friend.
Hey, wait, what did they say?
you know I'd rather stick with what Dana said.
she said you're a Muslim.
and I didn't mean it.
then why say it?
to guarantee everyone at your new school thinks you're out of your mind?
to make it impossible for me to show my face there?
to blow up your father's relationship with the vice president?
really, I want to know. Are you that starved for attention?
mom, I said it was a mistake.
a mistake? - No one believed it.
that's not the point.
I want to know why you would say such a thing?
no, don't look at him. I'm asking you, right here.
are you deliberately trying to crash and burn?
is that it? Do we need to send you to a shrink?
Jessica, stop. - No, seriously.
I want to know why she would say such an insane thing.
because it's true.
what?
dad, I'm so sorry.
I really did not mean to say anything, it just slipped out.
wait...
I didn't want to tell you because I knew it would upset you.
but you told Dana?
no.
no, she saw me praying one day...
in the garage.
the garage?
dad...
I didn't mean to. - I know.
it's okay.
it makes so much sense now, why you spend so much fucking time in here.
do you want to know why?
does it matter?
it does to me.
what matters is you lied to me.
every time that you came in here you were lying to me.
no.
Yes, Brody, yes.
do you know how fucked up that is?
do you know how much that hurts?
I'm sorry.
I - I don't understand.
these are the people who tortured you.
these are the people who if they found out Dana and Xander were having sex, they would stone her to death in a soccer stadium.
that's not supposed to touch the floor.
did you actually just say that?
I thought you put this crazy stuff behind you.
I thought we were getting somewhere.
we are. - No, we're not.
I married a U. S. Marine.
this...
this can't happen.
you have a wife, two kids.
you're a congressman in the running to be vice president.
it cannot happen.
you get that, right?
Yeah, Jess, I do.
does she know?
who?
the CIA woman... you were with.
does she know you're Muslim?
why are you even asking me that?
because she stood on our lawn and said a bunch of things I'm remembering all of a sudden.
Jess, that woman... was fired by the CIA and locked up in a mental institution.
wake up.
Oh, what time is it?
in the afternoon?
Yeah.
we're moving out in a little over an hour.
I need you to get up now.
you gonna be ready by then?
no problem.
okay.
sir.
please take off your jacket and remove anything from your pockets.
we'll need to retain your cell phone, sir, till you leave.
she seemed okay when I saw her.
in Virginia, in the bosom of her family where her mental state is coddled and cared for.
now she's 6, 000 miles away.
Mendez is there, she doesn't think Carrie's up to it.
is this Mendez talking or you?
it's both of us.
we've been through this, Saul. We have no other options.
no good ones, I admit, but if Carrie fucks up this operation then we have none.
can we push back 24 hours? - For what reason?
I'm still waiting to hear from two sources.
maybe one of them's gotten wind of something.
that married couple?
the professors with the American University?
they're not sources, Saul, they're dinner guests.
you said so yourself.
look, I know you're worried about Carrie.
I am, too.
but we got the wife of Hezbollah commander who says she has intel about an attack against America.
you still there?
I'm here.
the mission clock starts in an hour.
when the door opens, I need you to walk Carrie through it.
sorry I'm late. I got held up by a call.
no, I appreciate you taking the time.
I'm sure you got your hands full.
and I was just getting used to calling you Congressman.
Oh, the convention's still months away.
a lot can happen between now and then.
I doubt the vice president would be taking such a personal interest in prepping you unless he was serious about your prospects.
please, have a seat.
so, uh, I understand you used to work together when he ran the agency - the vice president.
bill Walden's the reason I'm in this job.
he pulled me off a division desk to help him run the drone program back when we only had eight Predators over Baghdad.
how many do you have now?
how many?
predators.
I don't know, 8,000?
9, 000?
you lost count? Al-Qaeda's been gutted because of those drones.
that's what matters, right?
right.
come in.
I'm sorry for interrupting, sir, but we've got a time sensitive matter.
what is it?
Oh, you can speak freely, as long as it's not classified.
Roya Hammad - she's filing an on-air story tonight and she wants a comment.
what? Now?
she's in the pressroom.
media Relations should be handling this.
they tried. They sent down the Public Affairs officer, but the DCI just weighed in, wants you to talk to her.
I am sorry to keep apologizing, but I need to take care of this.
no, do what you got to do.
you can wait here, I won't be long.
can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?
no, I'm good. - Thanks.
deputy Director?
ms. Hammad, what can I do for you?
please.
you can confirm or deny reports that only four of the targeted Iranian nuclear facilities were actually destroyed, and that the fifth is still operational.
reports from who?
multiple sources inside the government.
ours or theirs?
we're breaking the story tonight on World News with or without a statement from the agency.
Oh, do what you have to do, but if I were you, I'd sit on it.
unless you're okay with being wrong about the facts.
what do you mean?
have a nice weekend, Ms. Hammad.
you know I'm close, so at least help me get it right.
not a chance.
how about dinner then?
Saturday night? Cafe Milano.
I've got a standing reservation for two. 8: 00.
you can ply me with wine, feed me pasta.
I still won't divulge classified intelligence.
no worries. I'm sure we could find something else to talk about.
all right.
is that a yes?
Yes.
Saturday.
see if he can give Roya something else.
get her to sit on the story until we can find out who leaked this.
everything okay?
uh, yeah, fine.
BEIRUT-RAFIC HARIRI INTERNATIOALAIRPORT
traveling alone?
miss Morrissey? - I'm sorry?
I asked if you're traveling alone.
uh, yes.
you have anything to declare?
no.
hotel Commodore.
sorry I'm late. Half the streets are shut down.
Yeah. People are pissed.
so I've noticed.
how was your flight?
a little bumpy.
but you made it. - Yeah.
it's just like old times.
Carrie, listen to me carefully. You need to walk past the cafe.
do not stop.
Why?
I got company.
you hear me? - Uh, yeah.
there's a safe house on El Ghadin. 2218.
I'll meet you there when I lose them.
okay.
repeat the address.
uh, 2212 El Ghadin.
2218.
why have I never heard of this guy?
who? Quinn? - Just check him out.
please. - Okay.
I'm being asked to be part of an attack on this country.
I'm through.
Brody just blew it up. The whole operation's dead.
as long as his cover isn't blown, he's still in play.
Brody. Give me the keys.
I'm trying to keep you from spending the rest of your life in a cage.
this deal of ours...
...I think it's a way out for both of us.
yes?
I want to explain.
I'm glad you feel that way.
turn around. We're leaving.
she knows.
tighten up the follow vehicles now. We cannot afford to lose him.
you say you want another chance.
this is it.
they just grabbed him.
they're loading him into a helicopter.
we're losing him!
they're gone. They're... they're gone.
they're just gone!
go ahead, say it.
it's 12 hours since we lost Brody.
eight since Roya Hammad got back from wherever they flew him to.
terrorist chatter across all hot zones virtually nonexistent right now.
okay, I'll say it.
he's dead.
we don't know that for sure, Carrie.
if not physically dead, operationally dead.
and time's ticking away. We have to talk about moving on.
the only move we have is to roll up Roya Hammad.
unless Brody's not dead, and is somehow still in play with the terrorists, in which case lifting her burns him.
be his death sentence.
that's a lot of ifs and maybes.
agreed. Just putting all the cards on the table here.
we've got to bring Roya in.
let's do it.
Mike, can you do it?
don't, Saul.
I'm okay.
this is where we say good-bye, Nicholas.
forever, if all goes well.
you know I cannot do this without you.
Yeah.
you have Allah's trust, and therefore mine.
Allah knows more than anyone can how strong you are.
pray for me.
and you for me.
do you have a pay phone I could use?
wait, do I know you from somewhere?
no, I don't think so.
a pay phone?
not since last century.
well, do you have a cell phone I could borrow?
Hello?
Hey. It's me.
Jesus, where have you been?
Carrie, I need you to go get my family right away.
okay, and take them somewhere safe.
we've been going out of our minds.
I don't care where. I don't care what it takes.
can you please, please do that for me right now?
Yes. Where are you?
what's been going on?
I'll call you back in an hour, once it's done.
well?
leave Roya in play. Cancel the lift.
whoa, whoa, whoa. This man has been off the radar the past 12 hours, in the company of known terrorists.
we need to be extremely fucking vigilant here.
Carrie? - I... he asked me to...to move his family somewhere safe.
he's alive, asking us to protect his family.
that's a check mark in the plus column.
Carrie's right. Stand down the lift team on Roya Hammad.
what number was Brody calling from?
uh, 443 area code - a Baltimore cell.
run that number.
he said he'd call back in an hour, once the family's safe.
if there's a threat to them, what happens next has to look like just another day in the burbs.
Yeah, no CIA footprint anywhere near that neighborhood.
whoever we send in has to be somebody the Brody family knows and trusts.
shit.
I'm coming.
Jess, don't panic. Please, just listen.
do as I say. Everything's fine, but...
is it Brody? Is he all right?
I haven't seen or heard from him in two days. - The CIA sent me, Jess.
there's a threat. - A threat?
what threat? To us?
well, it's to do with something Brody's working on with the CIA, or else it would be him standing here.
you mean like a terrorist threat? - It's not specific.
this is just a precaution, so...
no school for you guys today. You're going to come with me.
we're coming with you where?
somewhere safe.
go get your brother.
Hurry!
this is bullshit.
if my dad wants to move us, he can come here and explai hn itimself.
it's not your dad, Dana; it's the CIA.
they were the ones who called me. - Trust me, it's my dad.
everything that goes wrong right now is my fucking dad, so get out of my room, Mike!
you don't talk to me like that.
I'm here to help, and you damn well know it.
I'm not asking, and nor is the CIA, so get your shit together because it's happening, and it's happening now, even if I have to carry you out of here kicking and screaming.
hello.
are they safe yet? - Yes.
where?
can't discuss that on an open line.
remember where we first met?
and I don't mean your office.
in the rain?
I'll see you there in 30.
come on.
let's go, man. Let's go.
the point is, until today, this look into Quinn that you and Carrie asked us to do was feeling like a big fucking jerk-off.
everywhere we looked, he checked out.
till today? What happened today?
we tracked down where he lives.
took a peek into his apartment.
shit, Virgil.
told you to check him out, not break into his apartment.
show him, Max.
anti-intrusion devices everywhere.
man lives like he's ready to bounce at a moment's notice.
that's it?
a CIA analyst is a security-phobe?
his personal life's a little wanting?
the field office is one thing, Saul, but I've never met an analyst that lives like this.
do you know what that is?
it's a rifle-cleaning kit.
that pull-through cable tells me that it's a rifle with a long-ass barrel.
a sniper rifle.
anything else?
one personal item. We found it tuckedwa ay in the only book that he has.
her name's Julia Diaz.
easy to trace because she's law enforcement.
Philadelphia PD.
find out what precinct she's in and get me the address.
Whoa! This is sick.
you're stocked up on groceries and some half-decent wine.
if you need anything else, pick up that phone, hit one-one.
we're in the apartments on either side.
is there anything else you can tell me about this threat?
all I know is that your husband is working with the CIA on it.
it's standard procedure for us to move the families of any high-profile people who are working on operations like this to safe houses.
is there a specific threat to me and my children?
not that we know of, no. But we don't take chances.
this is the most secure place that you can be.
okay, Jess?
there's a TV in every room.
every room? No way.
Yeah. They're all big-screens, too.
where have you been, Brody?
Where's my family? - They're in DC, safe.
you have my word. - Thank you.
of course.
I thought I was dead, Carrie.
it's really good to see you.
well, where did they take you on that helicopter?
I don't know.
40, 45 minutes.
very fast, very low.
west. And dark.
away from any signs of civilization.
we have to hone in on all of the details now.
every little thing. - I was taken to see Abu Nazir.
what? - He's here.
Carrie, he's here. He's in America.
and he's planning an attack.
wait... Abu Nazir?
how is that even possible? Jesus Christ!
so they wire you to the car battery.
what do you do?
I told them to kill me now.
because... whatever reason Nazir has to torture me again is...
fuck him.
after all I've been through, fuck him.
you dared him to kill you right off the bat?
Yeah.
then what happens?
they leave me there.
they don't turn on the battery.
I just sit there for a couple hours-three maybe,
I don't know-sweating it out.
then finally the door opens, and Nazir walks through with tea.
tea?
Yeah, the threat of torture was a test.
and I think this was, too.
we have become unsure of your commitment to our mission.
our mission"?
I don't know anything about a mission.
I did exactly what was asked of me-nothing more, nothing less.
you saved my life in Beirut.
no one asked you to do that.
what is it, Nicholas?
what is troubling you?
I wanted to avenge Issa's death, not kill innocent civilians.
what if it's the will of Allah?
neither of us know the will of Allah.
you taught me that yourself.
each of us must decide what we can or cannot do.
so now you must decide.
what is your will, Nicholas?
I tell him my will is close to breaking.
did he ask about your recent...
...specific wavering with Roya Hammad?
Yes.
And?
I told him I'd underestimated the love I have for my family.
and the fear for what would become of my wife and kids after I was gone had blindsided me.
how did Nazir react to your concern about your family?
your wife and children have nothing to fear...
if you stay true to yourself.
a clear threat.
did he ask you anything else?
no.
did he say how he got into the country? - No.
did he say about the why of it?
my choice was simple:
run, hide and wait for death like a cowering animal, like Bin Laden; or die taking the fight to the enemy.
and the specifics of this fight are?
tomorrow afternoon, the vice president and I are scheduled to greet the Special Operations group returning from Afghanistan.
at Dam Neck Naval Base.
300 soldiers to be reunited with their families.
Nazir plans to hit the homecoming.
how the hell is he gonna do that?
it's a locked-down, classified event.
all I know is what he told me.
he said he can't do it without me.
he said I'm essential to his plan.
and your essential part in this attack is what?
to convince the vice president to allow one reporter to cover the event.
Yes.
is there anything else?
no. That's it.
wait here, please.
let's go.
thoughts? Peter.
I don't know. It all feels too easy.
he could be lying;
Nazir could be playing him to misdirect us, lead us into a trap.
it's possible.
by his own admission, Brody's in a confused state.
spent 12 hours in the company of a man who has considerable power over him.
what do you think, Carrie?
I think the symbolism of murdering 300 American soldiers in front of their wives and children is quintessential Nazir.
it's an idea worthy of him.
elite troops just back from killing Muslims on the battlefield, just when they think they're out of harm's way?
so, with that in mind, if Nazir is planning to use Roya Hammad to breach the base, what are we looking at?
there's that trunk of explosives they pulled out of the tailor shop in Gettysburg.
What,'cause that'd be as simple as replacing her news crew with terrorists and launching a Mumbai-style attack?
uh, or a combination of the two.
bottom line is we can't not follow up on this, David.
Nazir is in our sights.
we have to play this out.
they don't believe me.
in 90 minutes, the vice president will be in your office, at which point David Estes will brief the two of you on these latest developments.
he'll protect your deeper involvement, of course, and you'll do your best to look surprised.
do you believe me?
I do.
because that's all I care about right now.
different phone, same number.
think you're the only one who understands this fucker needs watching like a hawk?
how about Carrie?
she understand that, too?
want to call your family?
no.
I'll just have to lie to Jessica again.
they're in good hands, though, right?
sure.
and tomorrow, all of this will be over.
right.
what's that look?
I thought it would be easier for them if they were with someone they knew.
let me guess: Mike Faber.
your call?
my call.
smart.
I thought so.
is Dad in the CIA now?
is he going to have to leave again?
I don't think so.
all we know is that he's helping them with something for now;
it'll be finished soon.
they playing?
you know what, honey? Can you do me a favor?
go set the table for dinner while we wait.
go on.
I understand you're angry, Dana.
I'm not angry at you.
in general, then.
Hey, I'm mad at Brody, too, Dana.
I can only imagine what it's like for you.
you know, sometimes...
I really just wish he had never come back from that stupid war.
don't say that.
I mean, ever since he's gotten back, everything has gone to shit, and it just keeps getting worse.
we all come back from that war with some kind of wound.
did you? - Sure.
for eight years, I thought I lost my best friend.
it's like I left him behind back there.
table's set, Mom.
David. - Sir.
Nick. - Sir.
little unorthodox.
Mr. Vice President, we have a situation that concerns both you and the congressman, and not a lot of time.
a few hours ago, we received intelligence from two separate sources in Beirut that Abu Nazir's terrorist network is planning to attack the Special Operations group homecoming at Dam Neck tomorrow.
we've got to divert the transport, cancel the event.
sir, we believe, with your help, we have an extremely high-percentage shot at killing or capturing the terrorist cell and stopping the attack cold.
with my help?
this is right in your wheelhouse, sir.
I'm listening.
it all hangs on the CNB correspondent Roya Hammad.
I know her, know her well. She's interviewed me several times.
sir, we believe she's working with Abu Nazir.
what?
based on verbal information from the same assets on the ground in Beirut.
Roya Hammad's a terrorist?
we believe, strongly, that not only is Ms. Hammad the delivery mechanism for this attack, whatever form it may take, but that she also intends to film it for broadcast around the world.
what do you need from me, David?
officially allow her the access she's requesting so that we can monitor her movements, catch the entire cell red-handed and roll them up before the attack can actually happen.
Where's the White House on this?
I'll leave that with you, sir.
I'll take care of the director.
what do you think, Nick?
one question, sir.
what happens if the plan goes wrong?
if this isn't done and dusted before you leave the residence for that base tomorrow morning, then we divert the troop transport and cancel the event.
which, I assume, would blow your entire operation.
Yeah.
sir, there is one more thing.
what?
we have good reason to believe that Abu Nazir is here, in the United States.
how the fuck did that happen?
that can't go further than this room, Mr. Vice President.
get me these terrorists, David.
Yes, sir.
make the call. Do it now.
Hello? - It's me.
vice president said yes.
how did you manage to convince him?
I told him that if he wants to officially nominate me as his running mate, then there'd be no better time and place to do it than at the naval base - in front of the returning troops. - Very clever.
our friend will be pleased.
good.
when the plane lands at the base, I'll be with my cameraman.
you should find a way to be with me.
do you understand what I'm saying?
Yes, I do.
see you tomorrow.
that's a bomb.
she just told him how to stay out of the blast radius. - Stay with the cab.
I want all eyes and ears on her until this thing's over.
we'll alternate in six-hour shifts. I'll take the first one.
that leaves me with the doom watch.
okay, so congruent triangles.
have you ever heard of the Donkey Theorem?
okay, give me the book. We'll look at it.
the capital city of the most powerful country in the world.
Yep.
the shit that goes on out there.
thank you.
for being here.
that woman was right.
this is only half-decent.
so, I figured you'd take the guest room.
Oh, I'm good with the living room couch.
take the guest room.
the kids will come in with me.
you called for me, sir?
officer Diaz?
and you are? - Richard Keller.
good to meet you, Officer.
what can I do for you today, Mr. Keller? - Richard, please.
is there somewhere we could speak in private?
what about?
your son.
actually, it's more about his father, John Sr.
who are you? Really?
IRS? Come with me.
I haven't seen John since John Jr. was born, so that's four years.
but he sends you money?
am I right?
I've upset you.
I'm sorry.
occupational hazard.
I'm a cop, sir, not a moron or a criminal.
so if you're looking to find some tax beef on me, write me a letter.
I can go get myself a lawyer, and we can do this right.
maybe it's not with you that we have a discrepancy.
maybe it's with your husband.
we were never married.
does he have anything to do with your son?
does that have anything to do with you?
if, uh...
if you could give me John's last name, for the record.
sure. I can confirm it for you.
it means you go first.
understood the meaning.
and since we're, uh, being all open and honest here,
Richard, how does the IRS get that picture of me and my kid?
has something happened to him?
what is this all about?
you're not IRS, are you?
if you'd like to check my credentials, be my guest.
well, I'm sorry to bother you, Officer.
have a good night.
you watching him?
he's at his station, doing his thing.
John X, aka Peter Quinn, is about to get a call from the mother of his child.
Hello?
what did he look like, this man?
no.
no, don't worry about it.
you did fine.
I got to go.
is Carrie still here?
Yeah.
I got to go deal with some personal admin bullshit for 30 minutes.
can you cover for me?
me, cover for you?
it's 30 minutes - no big deal.
sure, Not a problem.
you got him?
he took a bus. - East.
he's a slippery bastard.
he just got off. He, uh...
he ditched his jacket and put on a hat.
now he's getting on another bus.
he's, um...he's talking to someone.
where have you been? You look wasted.
I'm just old.
you'll get there sooner than you think.
see you at game time.
Max is on him.
so he met some guy on a city bus?
you know him?
dar Adal? That's Dar Adal?
that's him. In the flesh.
I knew him 18 years ago, when I ran company missions we don't talk about into Somalia, from Nairobi Station.
if Quinn reports to a guy like Dar Adal, he's no more an analyst than I'm in Hair Club for Men.
so what's he really doing on this task force?
I don't know.
you're early.
you're welcome.
FBI liaison, two operations officers from the Special Ops group.
the rest is in the memo.
Carrie already in position? - Since 6: 00 a. m.
along with two follow teams across from Roya Hammad's building.
waiting for her to get on the move.
tac team? - Two blocks off.
we sure it's just Roya in this cell?
what about the other three in the, uh, news team?
here she comes. Apart from a DWI and a minor drug charge, they check out, but until we know for sure, everyone's a terrorist.
Carrie We're moving. Black Town Car.
plate number L484K7.
we got eyes on her news van?
rolling follow team. The camera crew just pulled in to a restaurant two miles north of Dam Neck.
van's clean so far.
morning. How is everybody today?
holding up. Right, guys?
guess what. I just got clearance for you to give Congressman Brody a call on the satellite phone.
he could probably use a call now, and we figured you'd want to check in and let him know that you're all doing fine.
okay, great.
just family talk, though.
Hi. How are you?" That sort of thing.
no mention of the CIA, please.
Hello?
Hey, Dad. It's me, Chris.
he knows it's you, dorko.
what's going on?
just eating breakfast.
uncle Mike made huevos rancheros.
great. Say hi to him.
dad says hi.
so, uh, are we getting out of here soon?
sure, real soon.
this place is so cool.
Hey, listen, that's great. I'm just running out to work.
can I have a quick word with your sister?
sure. Bye, Dad.
Bye, Chris.
talk to your father.
Brody. You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, Jess. Where's Dana?
I don't want to.
she's, um...still sleeping.
well, give her a kiss for me.
Yeah. - Tell her I love her.
she knows.
what about you? You okay?
Brody, can you tell me anything about what's happening, what you're doing?
only that I'm glad you guys are safe.
and it's all going to be over real soon, and we'll get back to the way we were.
she's entering the restaurant.
she's at a window counter with her camera crew, where she has a line of sight with the news van.
looks like she's ordering breakfast.
Where's he going?
liaison with the FBI in the field.
FBI liaison? An analyst?
he's wearing two hats today. Go.
all call sites, stand by.
possible bogey.
wait out. Wait out.
blue SUV. Fits the description of the one
Brody saw Sandman get into yesterday.
unknown number of passengers.
is Nazir in it?
I can't tell. The windows are tinted. I can't see inside.
now they're just sitting there, waiting.
who's really running this operation, David?
Excuseme?
you or Dar Adal?
and Quinn. Who is he really?
what are his orders?
he's here to kill terrorists, Saul.
just like all of us.
stand by. There's movement.
the first person out of the vehicle is Nazir's munitions guy.
stand by.
and three I don't recognize.
one more still in the van who I can't see.
they're opening the back of the news van.
they're moving what looks like camera batteries.
now they're doing something at the rear of the vehicle which I-I can't see.
they're switching the camera batteries.
if that's the device, it's at least 200 pounds.
tac One, Tac Two, Tac Three, move now. Over.
show me your hands! FBI!
bogey on the move. Intercept.
got him.
going in to confirm it's Nazir.
stand by. Waiting for confirmation of Nazir.
show me his face.
it's not him. It's-it's not Abu Nazir.
it's not him. Sandman is not here.
we do not have Sandman.
stand down. You still need him.
I say again-stand down.
what the hell are you doing here?
watching your back.
we got them, Brody. Your information was good.
got them all?
all but Nazir. He's still out there.
so, believe it or not, I am your best friend in the world right now.
air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities...
pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie.
he has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
this will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.
this relentless pursuit of terror.
we will make no distinction...
the USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
this was an act of terrorism.
it was a despicable and cowardly act.
the next samba we're going to swing for you is one of the good old favorites.
...until something stops him.
it was right in front of my eyes, and I never saw it coming.
that plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
thousands of people running.
we must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.
you're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person
I've ever known.
I'm not the one who got it wrong.
I'm the only one who got it right.
take 'em.
take 'em all.
I'm inviting you into an ongoing operation, Peter.
Carrie's and mine.
you mean burning her in front of the Senate?
the case officer in question, she's been diagnosed as bipolar.
committing her to a mental institution.
this is a fucking sham! All an act.
part of the plan. Fuck me.
two nights ago, the deputy chief of Iran's Intelligence Directorate took the bait.
we believe he's on his way here.
what do you mean, Dana's missing? She disappeared three days ago.
she stole my car and broke her boyfriend out of the clinic.
his parents put him there to avoid a homicide charge.
the one thing I cannot have in my life is lies, - and y-you lied to me! - Dana, please...
I spoke to the President yesterday. He's concerned.
he's... exploring some changes in intelligence practice.
I'll do whatever it takes.
but I won't temper my views just to get your support for my confirmation as director.
I'm afraid you've got this backwards, old friend.
I'm the one getting nominated as director.
I didn't expect you back tonight.
this is Alain Bernard.
hello.
yes?
I think the watch is back on.
no sound.
any sign of Carrie? No, there's no sign of Carrie.
I'm too fucking far away.
I'm getting closer. Quinn, do not move.
Yeah, I'm inside. She's gone.
we lost her. But we know who's got her.
we're back in business. She's on her own, Saul.
she's always been on her own. Take it off.
police traffic cameras picked up three men leaving DC with Carrie in a Dodge sedan around 1: 34 AM.
false plates. Likely a stolen vehicle. Show him the UAV footage.
this might take a minute.
about time. - Oh, sorry.
my taxi got lost.
you took a fucking taxi to a CIA safe house? It's a joke.
I flew in from a job in Georgia; I got here as fast as I could.
I'm waiting.
trying to send him the drone feed.
the car turns onto the GW Parkway six minutes later,
beltway 14 minutes after that, then heads north on 270 towards Germantown.
pulls into a truck stop.
three men hustle Carrie inside.
the drone is now useless. Truck stop security cameras?
limited to gas pumps, cash registers and bathrooms.
nothing.
what about the car? They never went back to it.
it's still there six hours later.
so we lost her. Yes.
how about we check the car for prints, see if we can ID any of those three men?
no. We don't panic or do anything that could compromise Carrie.
right.
keep looking.
fuck.
firstly, Miss Mathison, I wish to apologize for the precautions we had to take in bringing you here.
I understand.
if we are to have a relationship that has any real meaning...
we must first establish the most important ingredient.
trust.
now...
are you ready?
Yes.
is this the month of March?
Yes.
are you married? No.
do you know who I am?
second in command of Iran's Intelligence Directorate.
morning.
his name is Alain Bernard.
he didn't stay the night, if that's what you're wondering.
how un-French of him.
we met in Mumbai.
he was researching an article on police corruption.
you don't need to explain yourself.
will you look at me, please?
I didn't do anything wrong, Saul.
when I met him...
you and I... had separated.
your decision...
not mine.
when your world collapsed...
I came running.
Yes. You did.
but I left something behind.
it was the whole life I was starting there.
so you're in love with him.
tell me.
don't do this, Saul. - It's a simple question.
yes or no- do you love him? We have fun.
he makes me laugh. How's that? Today is better with him in it.
that's all I needed to hear.
you should know, the...
president is nominating Andrew Lockhart...
as director of Central Intelligence.
what?
when did this happen?
nothing happened.
I don't think I was ever really in the running.
well, I'm so sorry, Saul.
Oh, don't be. I'm fine.
for God's sake, Saul...
stop this detached routine.
just get angry at something.
get angry at me.
I don't have any claim on you, Mira.
no, but you do.
surely you know that.
not anymore.
do you still work for the CIA?
Yes.
you're an analyst.
case officer.
a spy.
who's currently on administrative leave.
does anyone else know that you and I are meeting?
no.
are you able to provide me with information on CIA matters?
I told Mr. Bennett that I might be able to discuss some areas within certain strict parameters.
yes or no?
please.
I agreed to speak with you, and you alone.
I don't... I don't know these men- they're making me nervous.
you can trust them.
like you trust me.
the machine says you're lying.
are we completely alone now?
is anyone else listening to this? No. No one is listening.
shall we try this again? Hmm?
no.
no
we're done.
what are you doing?
it's time we talk about Nassir Hejazi.
Goalkeeper...
for the 1978 Iran World Cup team.
whose name you used to embezzle more than $45 million from the Revolutionary Guard.
you are now an enemy of your own state.
Brava, Miss Mathison. Quite excellent.
so, uh, when did you and Saul hatch this plan?
you bombed the CIA 1212.
we got to work in the early hours of 1213.
if you're considering killing me or running, forget it.
you're outnumbered and outgunned, and you'll never get off this property.
so, why am I not arrested already?
saul would like to talk to you first.
he used you to lure me.
saul Berenson- still, after all these years, putting other people's lives on the line.
tell your men that your plan to recruit me as an asset has worked.
then I'll take you to Saul.
now?
you can finish your cigarette.
for me to leave with you so quickly will arouse suspicion.
you'll find a way. I know my men.
I trained them.
you command and they obey.
the plan was to test you with the lie detector and, if satisfied, to give you a simple assignment.
that is how we recruit all of our assets.
there is no plausible way to explain a sudden change in that procedure.
what are you suggesting?
I tell them I have instructed you to retrieve an item of valuable intelligence and deliver to me in person.
valuable intelligence? Like what?
the intelligence that led to the six assassinations that your clandestine service carried out around the world in response to the bombing of Langley.
I can have that by this afternoon.
that fast? I'm that good.
otherwise, why go to all this trouble to recruit me?
3: 00 PM, seven hours from now.
where? Exit one off the 270.
there's a coffee shop right there- Raffi's Coffee Shop.
can't miss it.
falls Church train station is what I had in mind.
I just changed it.
270, exit one,
Raffi's Coffee.
wait here. - Make it quick.
saul should have instructed you to treat me with more respect than that.
bring me the bank files from Venezuela, please.
let's go.
this way.
let's go.
Where's Mr. Javadi?
I need to speak with Mr. Javadi again before I leave.
get in the car.
where would you like them?
the Venezuela bank files.
is that Javadi?
at a French restaurant in Tehran with our wives.
you and he were friends?
we were young intelligence officers during the dying days of the Shah.
complicated times. Who's that?
Sanjar Hootan, a professor of political science at the University of Tehran.
an agent of yours?
one of four I recruited there before the revolution.
this is Tal'at Basari, a concert-level pianist whose cousin had ties to Khomeini.
what's their relevance to you now?
I had to get all four out of Iran after the revolution.
their lives were in danger. Javadi offered to help.
he said SAVAK still had a safe house near the airport where they could stay while I got travel documents together over at the embassy.
when was this?
may 1979.
country was in full revolutionary crisis mode
khomeini's thugs in the street trying to consolidate power.
what happened?
when I showed up at the house...
their bodies were laid out on the carpet side-by-side.
I had promised them the protection of the United States government.
instead they got a bullet to the back of their heads.
it was his ticket into the new regime's security services.
I flew back to Washington, handed in my resignation.
not only were my people dead, but I watched a man I thought I knew become an animal...
in front of my eyes.
so this operation is your revenge.
no.
revenge was when I helped his wife and son escape to the West four months later.
that's her- Fariba.
this isn't going to be easy, is it?
turning an intelligence officer against his own country
well, that's the most delicate and uncertain work there is.
but he will turn, won't he?
you do have the advantage over him.
honestly, I don't know.
turning touches the stubbornness in some people.
he's a stubborn man to begin with.
out.
Hi, Mom.
what's going on? I need your help.
with what? Everything okay?
Yeah. What's that?
a name change application?
I can't be Dana Brody anymore.
I already made an appointment at the courthouse.
well, what are you going to change your name to?
Lazaro. My maiden name?
is that a problem?
when's your appointment?
well, they have an opening in, like, an hour, actually.
do you think that you could drive me?
please, Mom.
where are you? At my place.
he wouldn't come with me right away.
said it wouldn't fly with his guys, it was too risky, so I set a meet for later.
the plan was to bring him straight here.
I know what the plan was, Saul, but he had a legitimate problem with it, and I... I made a call in the moment.
Where'd he take you?
you don't know?
we lost you.
we knew it could happen going in.
move on, please.
2767 Green Meadow Drive, Stone Hearth Country Club, the northeast corner of the ninth green.
get the drone over that address now. Javadi could be anywhere by now.
he's gonna be right where you left him, I guarantee it.
he's had at least an hour without eyes on him. Which he can't possibly know.
how did he react when you dropped the hammer on him?
thousand-Yard stare for a few seconds.
then he began to wriggle a little, reassert himself.
he talked about you a little bit, too. What'd he say?
that, judging by the high-risk nature of this operation, you don't seem to have changed much.
what were the details of the meet you set?
the 270, exit one at 3: 00 PM.
I'm to bring him the file on how we hunted down his network.
okay, we'll get on that, we'll doctor one up.
drone is now over the golf course.
see anything?
no, it's very still. Nobody's outside the house. I can't see inside.
you've got to get actual eyes on Javadi, boots on the ground.
cannot afford to spook him or alert his men. Not gonna happen.
well, how can we be sure he's still there? I know this man.
survival's the only thing on his mind right now.
he will not take any unnecessary risks with his life.
you don't think he could've changed a little since you last saw him?
he will keep that meeting with you.
until then, you should get some sleep.
Quinn will deliver the file to you when it's ready and provide backup at the meeting point.
I hope you're right about this, Saul.
I am. Get some rest. You deserve it.
Mr. Adal. Senator.
the director apologizes for not being here and has asked me to take the meeting for him.
lead the way. - Yeah.
where is the director? I'm afraid I don't know.
he chose not to share that with me.
well, I, for one, am very glad to have this opportunity to visit with you, Mr. Adal.
thank you, Senator.
likewise.
may I speak plainly? Of course.
the Agency is a mess.
okay. - As far as I can see, it's being driven into the fucking ground.
by poor decision-making and god-awful leadership.
the hope is that you are the reformer your record in the Senate and on the Select Committee would indicate.
so, then, you agree that change is in order, no matter how painful.
in light of the worst attack this Agency has ever suffered, yes, I do.
how did this happen?
the past is the past. I'm more interested in what happens next.
what happens next is that we reclaim the respect and the fear that the world used to have for this Agency's hard punch.
reminiscent of some of the work you yourself have done.
in Somalia, in Libya, Uganda.
how can I be of service, Senator?
my confirmation hearing is in 12 days.
I don't want any surprises on my first day as director.
no skeletons, no unfinished business, no more Sergeant Brodys, no Carrie Mathisons.
God forbid.
yeah? It's me.
I'm here. Out back.
hold on.
you're early. Always good to have a cushion.
you get much sleep?
some. What's the latest on Javadi?
well, the drone picked up a car- a Buick- headed for the golf course house about an hour after you called in.
have we actually seen if Javadi's still there?
no. - Well, then that car doesn't mean shit.
you bring me the file?
Yeah. Verifiable electronic intelligence on how we hunted down those six targets.
no mention of sources or anything like that, but...
enough to make the suits in Tehran know that Javadi recruited the right girl.
if he shows.
saul's convinced he will.
I know what you're thinking.
no, you don't. Brody is America's most wanted man.
you're looking for possible sightings of him because it's your job.
new burner phone. Give me your old one.
all right. Let's go.
and are we keeping the same first name? Yes.
how long does it take?
three to six weeks.
that'll be $41. 14, please.
I've got money.
is that it?
Oh. Just a signature here.
old name or new name?
birth name, where it says "Applicant.
Thanks.
you seem like a nice young lady.
must have Mom to thank for that.
um, I-I just... I- I can't imagine what y'all are going through.
would you permit me to pray for you?
of course. Thank you very much.
God bless.
come on. Let's go home.
good luck. - Thanks.
sit in the window so I can see you. - Right.
is Javadi moving yet?
nothing yet. All quiet.
he's still in that house going through his options.
that's what I'd be doing. He's cutting it pretty fine.
by being late, he's making a point. Which is?
you may have me over a barrel, but I'll never be your bitch.
there's movement. Something's happening.
it's him. He's getting in the car.
he's heading west...
towards 270.
so far, so good.
I better take this. Stand by, Carrie.
this is it.
put him through.
Saul. - How was Lockhart?
disappointed not to see you. I can imagine.
but I think we had a productive meeting.
anything specific?
no. He's just trying to get his bearings before the big day. Of course he is.
anxious for a smooth transition of power.
that's what he said?
while remaining respectful of the work you've done.
sir!
we need you inside right away. I got to go.
he was headed south on 270, but he got off exit nine.
Where's Carrie again?
exit one. - Maybe he needs gas.
apparently not.
Carrie, you hearing this? I need you on the Beltway, heading north to intercept. Now.
copy that.
he's turning east onto...
mulberry Road.
he's cruising a residential area.
small streets. Lots of trees.
run a check to see what, if any, Iranian Americans live in the area.
racial profiling by neighborhood? FBI calls it domain management.
I'll check their database. - I can do that.
you stay on Javadi.
he's slowing down to almost a crawl now.
what the hell is he looking for?
he stopped. Uh, 1426 Longhill Road.
1426 Longhill Road belongs to Vincent D Carlyle, who rents it out through ACB Property Management.
well, who's the tenant?
the house was rented out by Susan Roberts, CPA with Brown and Getz in Annandale.
wait, uh, Roberts is not her married name.
the lease was originally cosigned by her ex-husband...
Nasser Javadi. They have a two-year-old son, Behrouz.
where are you, Carrie?
just past exit eight, five minutes out.
he's getting out of the car. - He cannot go inside that house. You must stop him going in that house, do you copy?
copy that.
for Christ's sake, Carrie, hurry.
hello.
can I help you? Do you know who I am?
Fariba's ex-husband.
Yes. Majid. And you must be Susan.
is that my grandson, Behrouz?
may I come in and say hello?
would you mind waiting just a second? Of course.
Susan, do you want me to take Behrouz to the park?
Hello, Fariba.
No! No! No!
you betrayed us! You betrayed us.
No! No! No!
stop or I shoot.
show me your hands. Someone talk to me.
now I'm ready to see Saul.
Oh, Jesus.
one of you tell me, please, what the fuck is happening.
he shot his daughter-in-law in the head, and then he, uh...
there's two fatalities and a lot of blood. Who's the second fatality?
hold on.
who's she?
tell Saul it's my ex-wife.
he took a bottle to her neck.
he killed her with a fucking bottle.
Fariba- what's she doing there?
she's meant to be in Witness Protection in California.
it's a fucking bloodbath, Saul.
you got to get him out of there as fast as possible and get the murder weapon, you understand?
Jesus fucking Christ. Do you understand?
Yeah, I understand.
leave your car a couple blocks away, then bring him here in his car. We'll get yours later.
you were never there. Follow the procedure.
check for security cameras, et cetera.
there's a baby in here. What do we do about the baby?
leave it.
what? We can't do that.
can't take the baby. You weren't there.
Oh, f...
it'll be all right. It's okay. It's okay.
come here. Come here. Yeah.
come here. You're all right.
we've got to get out of here.
Dana Lazaro. Sounds pretty cool.
kind of does, doesn't it?
I'll get it.
I'm a friend of Dana's.
Angela. Do you want to come in?
are you hungry?
I'm just here, you know, to pick her up.
where are you guys going?
like, camping?
no, Mom.
I'm moving.
to Angela's.
okay. No, you're not.
I don't even know Angela. No offense.
maybe I should wait in the car. I think that's a good idea.
I'll be out in a minute.
what, you were just going to sneak out?
I told you, Mom.
I can't be Dana Brody anymore.
right, and we went to the courthouse, and we filled out all those forms.
it's not just about my name.
you can't suddenly just leave.
it's not sudden. For you, maybe.
you've been thinking about it, obviously, but you never told me.
you told Angela, whoever that is. She's my friend.
don't take it out on her.
Dana, we haven't even talked about this.
there's no point in talking about this, because there's nothing to talk about.
mom,
I can't live this life anymore.
I just can't.
I mean...
it nearly killed me.
I've got to leave.
Oh, God.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
I'm gonna go now. Okay?
wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Dana, wait.
there's still $300 left on that.
mom, no. Please take it.
I need to do this on my own.
you don't have to use it. Just take it.
Bye.
looks like they beat us to it.
someone must have called it in before we could get over here to clean up.
got a police homicide squad already in overdrive over here.
keep moving. Don't stop.
hands.
this is just the fucking beginning.
you okay?
I don't know what I am.
shall we?
take the chains off.
stand up.
you don't look like a man who just landed the biggest asset of his career.
air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities...
pan Am flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie.
he has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
this will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.
this relentless pursuit of terror.
we will make no distinction...
the USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
this was an act of terrorism.
it was a despicable and cowardly act.
the next samba we're going to swing for you is one of the good old favorites.
... until something stops him.
it was right in front of my eyes, and I never saw it coming.
that plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
thousands of people running.
we must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.
you're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person I've ever known.
I'm not the one who got it wrong.
I'm the only one who got it right.
take 'em.
take 'em all.
I spoke to the President yesterday.
he's exploring some changes in intelligence practice.
I won't temper my views just to get your support for my confirmation as Director.
I'm the one getting nominated as Director.
the Agency is being driven into the fucking ground.
the hope is that you are the reformer your record in the Senate would indicate.
so, then, you agree that change is in order?
Yes, I do. Is that Javadi?
in a French restaurant in Tehran with their wives.
we were young intelligence officers during the dying days of the Shah.
I watched the man I thought I knew become an animal.
so this operation is your revenge?
revenge was when I helped his wife and son escape to the West four months later.
I need your eyes on Carrie. We dangled her to draw the Iranians out.
Javadi himself. Carrie Mathison.
are we completely alone now? No one is listening.
it's time we talk about Nasser Hejazi.
whose name you used to embezzle more than $45 million dollars.
you are now an enemy of your own state. So why am I not arrested already?
saul would like to talk to you first. He will turn, won't he?
turning an intelligence officer against his own country.
well, that's the most delicate and uncertain work there is.
he wouldn't come with me right away. Said it wouldn't fly with his guys.
it was too risky. So I set a meet for later.
plan was to bring him straight here.
can I help you?
stop or I shoot. Now I'm ready to see Saul.
there's two fatalities and a lot of blood. It's a fucking bloodbath, Saul.
you got to get him out of there as fast as possible. And get the murder weapon.
what do we do about the baby?
leave it. You weren't there.
you don't look like a man who just landed the biggest asset of his career.
so, what are we looking for here? A. 22...
and the top half of this bottle.
plum wine.
Yeah, some kind of Iranian thing.
I thought Muslims didn't drink.
how many? What?
he hit her how many times?
I can see at least a dozen separate strikes.
honestly, though, with this... who the hell knows?
Cal? We're still looking for the murder weapons here, Cort.
I may have something better. Neighbor's security camera picked it up.
money is wired from the Al Askari Bank in Tehran the first Friday of every month to the HLBC subsidiary in Caracas.
on your signature there.
we have traced the funds downstream to a series of terrorist actions, including the attack on the CIA.
but also to your personal accounts where you've diverted nearly $50 million of Revolutionary Guard money.
that's punishable by death if the IRGC were to find out.
what's your point, Saul?
that I've been brought down by a girl?
by two girls?
enough.
I think he appreciates the situation.
he manipulates people. That's what he does. I know.
you can't let him get to you.
well, he does.
Where'd you find that one?
the list of outraged Iranian exiles is long.
she won't last.
well, that's what you said about me in 1976.
when we were both starting out.
so you got me.
are you proud of yourself?
so far.
I know what you want.
what's that?
to clean me of what I know.
I imagine the state of our nuclear weapons program is high on your list, huh?
there is a deal to be made.
or I'd be in prison by now.
if I talk...
if I do that,
I need protection.
I need a secure compound in Miami with a guard detail.
and I want my money unfrozen.
all of it.
is that everything?
for now.
so you've put some thought into this?
those are my terms.
okay.
those are your terms.
but the problem is you got it all wrong.
cause what I want from you is not just intelligence.
why do you think I went through the trouble of documenting your financial misdeeds?
Why?
you killed 219 Americans.
think I care you also ripped off the Revolutionary Guard?
I got plans for you.
much bigger than you spilling a few state secrets.
what plans?
I'm gonna play you back into Iran.
from now on, you work for us.
for me.
I'm your new case officer.
it won't work.
Why's that? You burned me back home.
how? - I'm here with you.
they don't know that. - Oh, they will.
who's going to tell them? Not me, not you.
you came here under your own steam.
however you managed that, your story's still intact.
and if I refuse to go?
so we're clear?
I'm sending you back to Tehran one way or the other.
either as my asset or a traitor to the Revolution.
was this always the plan? - Shh.
don't think I won't, Majid.
that's not a trial and quick execution you're facing there.
you'll be tortured first.
and I understand public hangings are back in vogue.
I will tell you everything you want to know, chapter and verse, but I can't go back.
you will do both. No, I won't.
Yes, you will. - No, I won't!
you're bleeding.
good afternoon.
Yeah. Rough night?
not especially. You look tired.
can I get you anything?
you've been MIA for days now.
not really.
I've been here.
you've been absent. Saul, too.
you care to shed any light on that?
talk to Saul.
like I said, he's not so easy to find.
you're my guy, Peter.
I recruited you. I brought you up.
what's your point? - My point is that entitles me to a certain amount of forthrightness.
from you.
there was a double murder earlier today in Bethesda.
Fariba Javadi, ex-wife of the Iranian Deputy Security Chief.
also her daughter-in-law.
I understand it was a damn slaughter.
would you like me to look into it for you?
fuck you.
that's outside the house where it happened.
2: 53 PM. You're the main suspect.
I hope they nail your ass to the wall.
Where's Saul? - In the interrogation room.
did you know we're sending Javadi back to Iran?
you missed the fireworks.
Javadi blew when he found out he had to go back. We're on hold till they stop the bleeding.
we better not wait too long. Shit.
I'm about to start again. What's the deal?
neighbor's security camera picked me up. There's an APB out.
just you? Yeah, somehow it missed Javadi and Carrie.
Where'd you get this? Dar Adal. He monitors the blotters.
so he knows Javadi's in the country? He knows something's up; he's not in on it.
I suggest you go talk to him soon.
I will. - I mean now.
he's furious. I'll smooth things over. In the meantime, you need to stay out of sight here in this building. We can't risk having you arrested.
fine, but what do we do about this? There's a police captain in Bethesda who owes me.
I could call him, at least get the photo down off the wire.
do it, face-to-face. Play the national security card.
tell him you have my full support.
what if he wants details about the murder?
he can't have them.
if anyone even suspects Javadi's in the country, we're through.
well?
I checked the whole house for surveillance. I must have missed the neighbors.
Yeah, well, I missed the whole fucking thing. How's it going in there?
slowly.
trouble? Oh, we'll manage.
you seem upset.
that's good enough.
well? Well what?
have you come to terms with your situation?
how does it work?
we return you to your people as soon as possible.
I assume they've arranged a way for you to get out of the country.
no, I meant about Fariba.
a crime is committed that must be covered up.
how does it work here?
you killed her.
Why?
get back at me because you could?
she was my wife. She was unfaithful.
she was your ex-wife. It was 35 years ago.
in the eyes of God, we're still married.
I should have stoned her to death, but you didn't give me enough time.
remember this?
it was Fariba's 21st birthday.
we talked all night, the four of us, about what the future might bring.
it wasn't this.
I thought we were meeting outside. My guys have a few questions.
you told them I can't talk about it, right?
Yeah, I told them.
detectives Johnson,
cort, Carrie Mathison.
okay, I understand you're not happy about this.
Oh, and you are? Of course not.
we're as upset as you.
so who's this guy? I'm afraid that's classified.
but he's one of yours? Well, that's classified, too.
can you tell me what he was doing here? That's...
can you tell me how he knew the victims?
okay, wait a second. - Can you tell me any goddamn thing at all?
can you tell me why this lady's laying here with her throat cut to ribbons?
any fucking thing?
excuse me.
okay, Cap?
you're not a fanatic. You're a pragmatist.
always have been.
don't tell me what I am and what I am not.
well, we're both old men. There's no disputing that.
we are.
it's the curse of old men to realize that in the end, we control nothing.
so we lash out.
buenos Aires, Berlin...
bergen.
these are small acts, Majid.
unworthy of you.
you left something out.
the bombing of the CIA.
nothing small about that.
nothing unworthy. Well, I wanted to talk about that, too.
I'm sure you do. Because when that bomb went off, killing all those people, many of them my friends, my first thought was not revenge.
it was...
something has to change.
you hit us, we hit you.
it's always the same.
and...
how does my going back as your spy change any of that?
for years, we toiled in back rooms, you and I.
we toiled while shallower men held the stage, waiting for our time to come, gradually understanding it never would.
now it has, unexpectedly.
for you, it has.
you're the one who made it possible.
I want to return the favor.
does this look like a favor to you, Saul?
majid, thanks to you, I stand at the center of things.
you put me in power.
you go back to Tehran, I'll do the same for you.
I know a way.
you all right?
Yeah, sorry. I don't know what happened there.
so are we okay? I wouldn't say so, no.
I'm sorry, but can't you handle that?
you mean, can't I just pull rank and shut this thing down?
sure, just like you try with me. But you know what happens next?
somehow that photo and all the evidence in this room show up on Drudge Report or goddamn Wikileaks, and then you've got yourself a real problem.
and don't look at me like I'm being less than helpful.
I'm just talking reality here.
so what do you suggest?
they want to talk to the guy in the photo.
that's impossible. - You want this thing closed quietly?
find a way.
Where's Quinn? Uh, outside, I think.
could you find him? Was it always the plan to send Javadi back to Iran?
it was always the hope. No one told me.
well, you should be proud. Your work made it all possible.
I'm not proud. What he did to this country, it's nothing compared to what he did to Iran.
we should try him for what he's done. - That's not the plan.
that's not the plan. Go find Quinn, please.
he's in. - Good.
how'd you make out? Not so well.
they want to talk to you- the local cops do.
you told them that was impossible, right? - Several times.
I thought your captain friend was gonna take care of this.
Yeah, me, too. He boned me.
the important thing here is to not jeopardize the Javadi play.
Agreed? So let me talk to them, the cops.
and say what? I don't know, see what they ask.
you know what they'll ask.
you're their only suspect, and since you can't tell them what actually happened, you'll be admitting to two murders and then saying they can't touch you for it.
okay.
look, we have police threatening to blow up our operation.
at the very least, this buys us enough time to get Javadi out of the country.
so unless you got another option? Do it.
at least let me go with him. No. Javadi came here to contact you.
you're the only one who can be seen with him. I need you to get him back to his people.
when? - Soon as possible.
you got to get him out of the country before anything else blows up, and you need to stay right by his side. We cannot risk another screwup, okay?
where will you be? - I got a meeting with Senator Lockhart, who's apparently noticed.
I haven't been at my office all week.
we need to keep this thing together until Javadi's on a plane heading back to Iran.
it's time. Carrie will take you back.
and what makes you sure I won't just vanish?
this way.
she'll be with you all the way to the plane.
I meant in Iran.
what I said before. You started this.
I think you'll want to be there when it ends.
I need to know something before you leave.
I need to know.
who was responsible for the bomb?
the bomb at Langley? Yes.
on the ground that day. Who was responsible?
I thought it was Brody. That's what you told the Senate.
that's what you told the entire world.
you have a manhunt on five continents, a $10 million reward...
did he do it? Yes or no.
I don't know. I don't believe you.
I don't... - Look me in the eye and answer.
it wasn't him.
it was one of Abu Nazir's guys.
who, exactly...
I didn't want to know.
we'll get you some clothes to change into.
then Carrie will take you back to your plane.
will you give me a sec? Yes, sir.
Saul? Where are you?
driving. Home?
no. Back to work.
I've been thinking about our days in Tehran.
Really?
that was... a long time ago.
Yep. We were so young.
I was so worried about you when it all went to hell.
about getting you out.
Yeah, no, I was... worried about you.
leaving you behind.
I said I didn't care about your friend from Mumbai, but I do.
I said I didn't have any claim on you.
Saul... But I do.
maybe it's just in my own mind at this point.
I don't know. But I needed to tell you before it's too late.
did you hear me? Yes.
it's the first time I could come up for air in nearly two days.
I wanted you to know.
when are you coming home?
usual.
not till late. Okay.
well, I'll see you then.
just follow the tags, and...
in there.
what's this? How we'll contact you.
memorize it. Also your cover story.
the information you pried out of me that justifies your coming here.
it's how we took down your network.
is it true? It's verifiable.
who is the source?
if I go to Iran, I'll have to take the traitor out.
you know that. The source is a hack we did, a computer virus that allowed us to monitor your communications.
you want to take it out, go ahead. We have you now.
it's time to go back to your people. You ready?
Yeah.
what were you planning to do, bypass me entirely?
I'm not going to apologize. I had to keep the circle small.
not that small. You, Carrie, Quinn.
and come to think of it, I haven't seen that headscarf for a while.
all need-to-know. I thought we trusted each other.
just you.
I tell just you. I don't see how.
you've got Lockhart waiting in your office.
you think he didn't notice that the ex-wife of the IRGC Chief got slaughtered in Bethesda?
or that Carrie, whom you committed to a psych ward, got out and you're doing shit about it?
he's the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, not some civilian fuck-monkey.
okay.
I do have something going. An operation...
and we're past that. It's time for details.
fine.
I'll tell you both.
you never told me whose idea it was.
to hang you out as bait.
was it your idea or Saul's?
that's all right.
you don't have to say. It was Saul's idea.
it had to be. In fact, it's classic Saul.
if it's so classic, why'd you fall for it? Why do you think?
it was you.
the abuse you went through.
what Saul did to you to get me here.
even I have never done anything so cruel.
you're forgetting I've seen your handiwork.
you can't bullshit me. I'm not bullshitting you.
then you're seriously deluded.
you know what he asked me? Why you killed your wife?
who moved the bomb. If it was Brody.
now, why would he ask me that?
that implies that there's a difference of opinion on that subject.
right?
What'd you tell him?
that it was one of Abu Nazir's guys.
not Brody?
no.
who?
someone else.
that's all I know.
you Peter Quinn?
uh, yeah.
what? That's a difficult question?
no. Cause your compadre Mathison, she promised what she called "Candor."
Peter Quinn is, uh...
what? My legal name.
uh, one of the victims, she was Iranian.
Yes.
ex-wife of an Iranian security guy... IRGC?
Yes. And the other victim, that's his daughter-in-law?
Yes. I assume that's significant.
right.
these are some terse responses.
look, can we just get on with this? "On with this"?
we are "On with it. " How are we not "On with it"?
my colleague led me to believe you were after a confession. Well, that's incorrect.
what I said was, I'm trying to understand what happened here.
that's not gonna be possible. Yeah, that's what she said.
she said all I need to know is that it's national security.
this is. This.
look, I know you think I'm just some dick jacking you up because I can, cause you were unlucky enough to get yourself photographed.
and maybe that's true, I don't know. But actually,
I'm just trying to understand this shit that you people do.
this shit that we're a party to cause we pay taxes.
this...
this shit.
so you killed the daughter?
Yes. With?
a Walther P22.
what about the mother? Same weapon?
no.
that was with a bottle.
plum wine.
for national security.
you fucking people.
have you ever done anything... but make things worse?
this is special access information.
fine.
it can't leave this room. Understood.
so?
I've recruited a high-level Iranian asset.
irgc Deputy Chief Majid Javadi.
Yes.
the man who financed the bombing of the CIA. That's right.
why on Earth would you trust him?
we've developed information that would compromise him with his own government;
evidence of wholesale corruption. Which, in Iran, just means it's Tuesday.
normally I'd agree.
but this is tens of millions of dollars siphoned from a secret IRGC fund designated for terrorist activities.
no one would look the other way. So you blackmailed him.
that's right.
is there some reason you didn't tell my Committee? I was waiting for it to be real.
it wasn't because this is just the kind of human intelligence nonsense that led to disaster right here in this building not four months ago?
believing our sworn enemies will magically switch sides.
we talked about this, the need to wean you of your cold war bullshit.
we agreed to disagree. I don't see it that way, not when I'm inheriting your mess in ten days.
a mess.
that's what you call placing a major asset inside a government that's been a black box for 30 years?
you asked me what I've been doing.
I told you.
are we done?
not by a long shot.
I want to know how this happened.
almost there.
almost there and you still haven't asked.
what? Who moved the bomb.
you told Saul it was one of Abu Nazir's guys.
Yes, I did. Which I already knew.
and who handed him the keys?
don't tell me you never wondered.
I bet you wonder all the time.
Brody escaped the blast.
did he know it was coming?
maybe I already know the answer to that.
maybe you don't.
fine. I guess you don't want the truth.
I do. I just don't think I'd get it from you.
okay.
I want to know about the wife. What about her?
you recruit Javadi, his wife's suddenly dead along with the daughter-in-law.
don't tell me that's a coincidence. It's not.
so who did it?
you know, every time you answer a question with a big, gaping nothing, it reminds me what a problem we have, you and I.
it was Javadi.
wait a second. You're saying he was in this country?
that's right. And you knew this?
we lured him here. Carrie did.
so, wait.
you two...
you were working together.
even when you were denouncing her in front of my Committee.
all for show.
did you know?
I'm learning it now with you. Well, who did know?
everyone who needed to.
no, everyone who needed to didn't know, because two of those people are in this room right now holding their dicks. I want Carrie brought in... now.
she can't come here now. And why is that?
she's busy. She's putting Javadi on a plane back to Iran. He's still here?
ground the fucking plane.
no. - Ground it.
I'm Acting Director for another two weeks. It's not your call.
I'll bump this up to the President, I swear to God. Then what?
we fry Javadi's ass publicly.
well, that's shortsighted. It's justice.
it's ineffective... cause back in Tehran, he's replaced by someone just like him who we can't control.
and the attack that happened here happens again and again and again.
this is a once-in-a-lifetime operation that can transform everything.
the entire Middle East. You sound like you're fucking high.
I'm calling the President.
did you hear what I said?
I'm calling him. Get me a goddamn phone.
fine.
here.
destroy everything we've been working for. I'm not even going to dignify that with a response.
you really don't get it, do you? - You know what?
for the first time, I think I really do.
I see now why this place has been a fucking clown act for decades. How does this work?
I'm not sure.
and don't worry. I'll handle the President.
open the door.
no. Open the goddamned door.
make me.
dar, let me out of here.
you're dead. Both of you son...
what the fuck?
well, you had your chance.
wait!
it's okay.
you said you'd tell me the truth. And you told me I was incapable.
you might be right.
but if you want to talk to someone you can trust...
who was there, you should know that the man who built the bomb and moved the SUV...
he didn't die in the explosion like they say.
as far as I know, he's still in this country.
where? I don't know.
who does? Someone you've already met.
the man that brought us together.
your lawyer? Bennett?
no. The way this worked out, believe me, he's not my lawyer anymore.
you requested radar following on Three Six Oscar?
Yes.
that aircraft cleared US airspace at 2219 hours.
thank you. Yes, sir.
an audacious operation.
just the beginning.
here's to continued success.
you know, I do need to apologize...
for excluding you.
you don't have to explain yourself, Saul.
you are the goddamn Acting Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
for ten more days.
senator Lockhart managed to get himself stuck in the conference room.
could you ask facilities to let him out?
how'd it go? They're standing down.
so it went well.
what do they say, confession is good for the soul?
only you didn't do it.
I know.
but it made me feel better.
wrong crime, right guy, I guess.
you know what else I realized?
just how through I am with...
this, the CIA.
I just do not believe anymore.
believe what?
that anything justifies the damage we do.
you can't quit yet.
Javadi's out over the Atlantic heading home.
and he told me something before he left... about the Langley bomber.
you mean Brody. No, that's just it.
it's not him, and I can prove it now.
but...
I need your help.
sure, Carrie.
whatever you need.
how-how was your day?
had a good day.
actually a really good day.
forgive me.
for what?
I'd forgotten...
how beautiful you are.
air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities...
pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie.
he has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
this will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.
this relentless pursuit of terror. We will make no distinction...
the USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
this was an act of terrorism.
it was a despicable and cowardly act.
the next samba we're going to swing for you is one of the good old favorites.
...until something stops him.
it was right in front of my eyes, and I never saw it coming.
that plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
thousands of people running.
we must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.
you're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person
I've ever known.
I'm not the one who got it wrong.
I'm the only one who got it right.
take 'em. Take 'em all.
I got plans for you. What plans?
I'm gonna play you back into Iran.
from now on, you work for us.
the Senator's made some serious allegations.
that you had Majid Javadi in a safe house on American soil and let him go.
we debriefed him, turned him. He's ours.
I've made a decision to give the marriage another chance.
so I told him something before you left... about the Langley bomber.
you mean Brody.
no, that's just it. It's not him.
the bomber's the only way to prove that Brody's innocent.
Carrie, what the fuck are you doing?
Carrie, turn around now.
this is your last warning.
got a gunshot wound to the upper left bicep.
significant bleeding. Might have clipped an artery.
where the fuck is Saul?
you're awake.
where am I? The Naval hospital.
they brought you here after you were shot.
careful, you don't want to rip the sutures. Quite a few of them.
it was a through and through. Missed the bone.
some muscle and tissue damage but no nerve involvement.
you're lucky.
no, he's just a great shot.
how long will I be in here? As long as you need to be.
for me to heal or for the CIA to figure out what to do with me?
you'd have to talk to them.
are you aware you're 13 weeks pregnant?
Yes.
the baby should be fine. In case you're wondering.
pupils reactive to light.
bp of 60 over 40. Too fucking low.
lay down.
he started going cold turkey on the flight, so they knocked him out - with a half pint of vodka. - Idiots.
pulse is thready.
take it easy.
Where's my stuff, you fucking thieves?!
fuck! Where is my stuff?! Calm down, goddamn it!
Where's my stuff?
don't move now.
you've got seven days till Lockhart's confirmed.
you think this guy's gonna be ready by then?
he's not what we expected...
but he's what we've got. If he agrees to do it.
he's a mess...
anemic...
severely dehydrated, probably hep C.
hiv isn't a stretch.
if you're suggesting a hospital, it's out of the question.
I'm pretty sure I can keep him stable, but the guy's a junkie, sir.
how far is he into withdrawal? Hardly started.
what he's feeling now, it's gonna get a hell of a lot worse.
methadone would make it easier. Has to be cold turkey.
where he's going, we need him functional.
even if it kills him? It won't.
cause you will keep him alive. Do you understand?
sir.
you all right?
whoa, whoa!
stop! What are you doing?
I need it! There's nothing there for you.
no, I need it now! - No.
give it to me, give it to me, give me...
Hey, grab him!
Where's the needle? Got it.
cover him up. Stay down.
please...
how are you feeling?
the doctor says you're progressing nicely.
you'll be up and walking in no time.
though, not necessarily out of here.
there are two armed guards outside your door.
you know it never ceases to amaze me how you people close ranks.
here you are, a casualty of some CIA op gone very, very wrong, basically a prisoner, and still, somehow, I'm the enemy.
you are aware that the CIA charter does not include operations on US soil?
you know, I'm on painkillers.
I can barely understand anything you're saying.
well...
I've been going through your file.
the fact is, you need someone you can trust.
and why is that?
you're lying there shot and you need to ask?
the man who did this to you, he's on his way out.
but I need to know...
what's he up to?
ask him.
what was he doing in Caracas?
you didn't even know he was there, did you?
I got another message from Carrie.
is she calming down at all? No, the opposite.
senator Lockhart just paid her a visit.
somehow, he knows about Caracas.
it's impossible. Well, he does.
you think he suspects? I'm sure he doesn't have a clue.
she does now.
so what do we do about that? Same as before;
keep her under guard at the hospital.
away from Brody. And Lockhart?
I don't know how the hell he found out.
no one knew besides us.
have our houses and offices swept.
every room, top to bottom.
what happened? Shat himself.
Jesus Christ.
who are you?
don't talk.
you're soldiers, aren't you? Don't talk.
it's burning! It's burning.
it's not hot.
it's burning!
it'll continue as bad as this, or worse, another three days.
and at least a week after that before the stuff's out of his system.
so you're saying ten days. We have six.
Plus, at the end of all this, he's gonna be weak as a fuckin' kitten.
there is another option.
what?
ibogaine.
it's a drug based on a Nigerian plant.
it dramatically accelerates the withdrawal process and kills the addiction.
the side effects are brutal, which is why it's outlawed here.
nausea, vomiting, some hallucinations.
violent, mind-bending hallucinations.
does it work?
it does.
take my word.
say something, you motherfucker.
don't just stand there.
say something...
of United States Marine.
God...
get out.
get out!
what the fuck did you give me?!
no...
give me that! Get off me!
get off!
get off of me! Get off!
get off me, no!
he'll sleep now.
for a while.
maybe we should just call Saul's landline, trigger the voice activation, double-check our tracking program. We could.
but...?
this house is leased to a shipping consortium out of Tel Aviv.
it's got Mossad written all over it. - Yeah, but what if it's just a monitoring station, or a dead drop?
then we're wasting our fucking time.
are you gettin' this?
you're alive.
that wasn't a given.
want some water?
why couldn't you have just left me there to die?
I think you know that wasn't really an option.
so...
what now?
that'll be up to you.
a trial?
cause I didn't do it.
you talking about bombing the CIA?
I'm inclined to agree.
but your transgressions don't begin or end there.
and I'm not about to engage in a back and forth where you somehow end up the victim.
we both know what you've done.
we both know what you are.
a man who's dug himself into a hole so deep, common sense'd tell you there's no way out.
I am telling you, though, that there might be.
how?
I'm offering you a chance to be a Marine again.
the man you were...
before they broke you.
please.
no more.
I'm done.
you are not.
you will do this one last thing.
no.
so kill me. Kill me now.
you want to die, huh?
we'll see about that.
put him overboard.
fuck this shit. I'm going in.
don't. He'll come up.
I don't believe this.
fuck it. Let's go.
pull him...
he went down like a stone.
no attempt to save himself whatsoever.
now he's refusing to eat. Make him.
how do you expect us to do that? It's called force-feeding.
all due respect, sir, the guy's a waste of space.
now, I suggest whatever you've got in mind for him, just push it six months.
let us do this thing right.
you done letting us in on your thought process?
Yes, sir.
get him to eat.
he's right, you know. Our window's closing fast.
it's now or never, Saul.
how you feeling? As if you actually cared.
you know, I've had time to think here.
and I keep coming back to the fact that this bullet in my shoulder would never have happened without your okay.
you were about to compromise the mission.
I was about to clear Brody. You said you were behind that.
clear Brody. " What does that even mean?
so you lied to me.
I don't think you want to go there
who lied to whom.
Brody slipping out of the country while you were unconscious for 14 hours.
you think I believed that for a second?
you know I was in Caracas, you left me a message.
don't you want to know how he is?
how is he?
he's not well.
what did you do to him?
you know, the assumptions behind that question are so misguided, it frightens me.
I found him in a bad way.
believe me.
it wasn't something I wanted.
where is he?
in Virginia.
at Dam Neck.
got a special ops team trying to get him in shape.
in shape for what? That's what I wanted to talk about.
I have a play.
it involves Brody.
and I'm hoping you'll convince him it's in everyone's interest.
you told me Javadi was the play. He is.
Brody's the next phase.
and you need me why?
I'm assuming he already turned you down. We didn't get that far.
like I said, he's not well.
so, what is it? What's your big idea?
head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.
right.
Javadi's boss.
and the single greatest impediment to peace.
I want him gone.
well, good luck with that.
Brody can get to him.
how? As the Langley bomber.
Brody seeks political asylum there.
gets an audience with Akbari, takes him out.
Javadi's the heir apparent.
he ascends the throne, and he goes from being one of the 20 most important people in Iran to one of three.
only he's working for us.
Brody takes him out?
Yes. Come on, Saul, you're reaching.
Akbari's better protected than the Ayatollah.
Brody's got a knack for getting into tight places.
he's done it before. At best it's a suicide mission.
no, he'll have a team on the ground.
and you expect me to convince him of this?
I expect you to consider deeply the upside of placing a US asset at the very top of the Iranian food chain.
that's what I expect.
Javadi won't be just an intelligence source.
he'll be in control of the entire Iranian security apparatus.
that doesn't mean he'll roll over and play dead.
I know.
but he can do something.
something to break the long jump.
something besides another war.
something that'll change the facts on the ground...
just enough...
so two countries that haven't been able to communicate for over 30 years except through terrorist actions and threats...
can sit down and talk.
that's the play, Carrie.
tell me it's not worth your time.
Brody, I want you to know that I didn't know you were here until today.
I came as soon as I heard.
tell me if there's anything I can do for you.
anything.
when do you need him ready by?
27th of this month.
why so soon?
it's the day Senator Lockhart's confirmation hearings begin.
right.
tell me what happened to him in Caracas.
a world of shit as far as we know.
he was gut-shot at the Colombian border.
nearly died.
got hooked on the painkillers, I guess.
there was also an incident at a mosque.
an imam and his wife were murdered.
because of him?
because of him.
I need a vehicle.
what happened to your arm? Hang gliding accident.
for real? Fucking CIA, Baraz.
what are you asking her questions for? Just making conversation.
it's the next left.
what now?
now we wait.
we sat on the house for 24 hours.
and this is the only person who ever came in or out.
Oh, Christ.
you know him?
Yeah, I'm afraid so. Who is he?
a friend of my wife's.
his name is Alain Bernard.
she met him in Mumbai.
they struck up a relationship there, which may or may not be ongoing.
I hate to ask this, Saul, but do you think Mira's aware?
that he's an Israeli intelligence officer?
no.
falling for the guy is her only crime.
what do you want me to do? For the time being?
pick him up. Put him in a dark fucking hole.
what about Lockhart? How does he fit into the equation?
I think I buried a lead. Meaning what?
after our guy left the safe house, I followed him to Pete's Diner,
capitol Hill.
Hey, assholes, let me out! Brody...
get off me! Oh... God...
let me the hell out! - Relax!
Brody! Motherfucker!
Dana, it's me! Dana!
get back... - Get off of me...
fuck. Dana! She can't hear you, Brody.
you... you bitch.
you fucking bitch.
is he in? Is he expecting you? Sir, you can't go in there.
I'm hosting a fund-raiser that night anyway.
listen, I got to go. What the hell, Saul?
what is this? Open it.
care to explain?
alain Bernard is writing a profile on me for Le Monde.
20 minutes ago, Alain Bernard admitted to being an asset of Israeli intelligence.
and I should be concerned about this... why?
because he claims he passed you information obtained from a listening device planted in my home.
that's preposterous. Is it?
one call to Ambassador Benayoun, it would be an international incident.
a second call to The Post, and your picture'd be on the front page of every newspaper in the country.
what do you want?
time.
time?
postpone your confirmation until the middle of next month, and these'll never see the light of day.
I don't understand.
it's a simple request. Give me a few more weeks.
that's not what I meant.
you could destroy me with this.
you could guarantee your own tenure as director.
why are you letting me off the hook?
because it would humiliate my wife, Senator.
and because it would damage the Agency.
badly.
we have a deal?
we do.
I was hoping you've calmed down enough to talk.
what's Dana doing cleaning motel rooms - in the middle of nowhere? - Why?
is something wrong with that?
being a maid? - There's nothing wrong with that, goddamn it
I just want to know what's going on with my daughter!
drink it, and I'll tell you about Dana.
slowly, or you'll be sick.
there.
now, what's going on? Well, she's had a rough time, Brody.
she dropped out of school.
she moved out of the house.
she changed her last name.
take me back to the motel. That's not gonna happen.
for Christ's sake, Carrie. I told you.
if you want to see her again you have to...
quit your fucking games, Carrie! I need to look her in the eye.
I want her to know I'm innocent!
if you keep yelling, this conversation is over.
now I would like to tell these two men to leave, can I do that?
what do you want?
the same thing as Saul Berenson, I'm guessing.
some bullshit about me being a Marine again?
what do you want, Brody?
what have you always wanted?
a chance at redemption.
for the last time, Carrie. I didn't do the bombing.
you of all people should know that. I'm not talking about the bombing.
I'm talking about the suicide vest.
I'm talking about the death of Elizabeth Gaines and those two Secret Service agents outside the State Department.
I'm talking about what happened to that imam and his wife in Caracas.
do what Saul is asking.
what you're asking? - All right, what I'm asking.
if not for your sake, then for Dana's.
otherwise, telling her you're innocent is just...
is just one more lie.
look at me, Carrie.
you couldn't send me out for a pack of cigarettes right now.
we'll get you ready.
you just have to be willing.
well, look who's come out to play.
about fucking time. Did you get Mommy's permission?
Hey, shut the fuck up, everybody.
we're going this way.
you ready?
come on. On your feet.
no. He needs to do it by himself.
tell me when you're good to go again. Now.
go.
sixteen Days Later
find Maputo, Mozambique.
what's the frequency?
what language are they speaking?
Portuguese.
bottom three cards? Eight of clubs.
ten of hearts.
Jack of spades?
spell her last name.
uh, B-A-C-Z
it says here she's hotter than what?
georgia asphalt? - And who said that?
lula Fortune to Sailor Ripley in Wild at Heart.
Fucking-A right.
Yeah.
so, you guys got something going on?
no. Come on, man,
I've seen the way she's checking you out when you're not looking.
there's nothing.
Seriously?
seriously.
so, you don't mind if I... if I hit that shit then, right?
see? There is something.
I knew it.
no, go ahead. Really.
Nah, man, I'm just fucking with you.
I'm married.
and, uh, we just had our first kid.
it's a boy. Name's Devon.
how come I didn't know that?
just...
I don't like talking about my family.
superstitious.
Hey, we're on in five. In the briefing room.
iranian patrols in the area are intermittent.
but they are well-trained and equipped.
also, there is also an IRIAF base in Bijar, 70 miles away, which means they can call in air support.
what kind of planes are we talking?
uh, some French-built F-1 Mirages impounded from Iraq after the First Gulf War and six Chinese SU-24s.
excuse me, can we back up a minute? Sure.
the guys gets me to the border... where I surrender myself?
correct.
we chose Marivan because several Al-Qaeda commanders also asked for political asylum there.
what happens then? I get flown to Tehran?
after a period of vetting, yeah, that's our expectation.
okay, but what makes you think I'll ever get close enough to General Akbari to take him out?
you'll be treated as a hero of the Revolution.
the senior members of the regime, like the general, want to take advantage of your propaganda value.
plus Javadi's on the ground to facilitate a meeting between the two of you.
but if we don't know where or when the assassination goes down...?
you're concerned about our extraction plan. How we're gonna get you out of there once it's done?
Yeah.
I was just getting to that.
once you're inserted at the border, four members of your team will continue south to Nodesheh, where they cross the mountains and make their way overland to Lavasan, a small city just outside Tehran.
opposition groups there have provided us with a safe house.
we've already gone ahead and put in secure Satcom.
since when do you smoke? I don't.
I'm not.
it just looks like I'm smoking.
there. It never happened. You saw nothing.
nothing.
look... I did what you asked.
I'm doing what you want.
now you told me you'd take me to see Dana again.
I meant after you get back. Come on, Carrie.
we both know that's a long shot.
we made it this far.
that's true.
I admit, I had my doubts.
is that why you've kept your distance?
Hey, it's fine. You're entitled.
you're loading out in six hours.
I'm not sure I can get you off the base and back in time.
well, I'm not leaving until I see Dana again.
it's there. 119.
Brody, there's something you need to know.
before she changed her name, before she left home...
Dana was hospitalized.
about two weeks after the bombing...
she tried to kill herself.
who is it?
Dana, it's me.
it's your dad.
how did you find me?
can I come in?
Dana, please?
thank you.
I had to see you.
okay.
you have.
Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry.
don't be.
how are you now?
why are you here?
I just wanted to tell you that all those things those people said I did, I didn't do.
fine. Fine, good.
I didn't kill all those people.
it wasn't me.
I didn't do it.
and I have to leave soon. In a few hours.
but I just wanted to see you before I go.
you did.
did you ever, for one second, think about if I wanted to see you?
what... what do you want to hear? That you were a good dad?
that despite everything, it's all okay?
what do you want me to say?
look...
look, here... here, just write it down.
really, just write it down and I will say it to you...
as long as you promise I will never have to see you again.
either of you.
I will come back from Tehran.
I know you will.
and not just for her.
where the fuck were you? He wanted to talk.
he's got 45 minutes to load out. He's all set.
you took him off base. He threatened to pull out, Saul.
anything could've happened out there. But it didn't.
I am truly at a fuckin' loss with you.
have a little faith, Saul.
two weeks ago, there was no operation. Now there is, because of me.
I really need you to get that.
because in order for us to pull this thing off, we're gonna have to find a way to trust each other again.
or at least come up with a really great plan for faking it.
see you on the other side.
all he has to do tonight is walk across the border and ask for asylum.
and in the unlike event that anything goes wrong? We have it covered.
who the hell are you?
I know you're related to Nina Carlisle.
trust me, you don't want to get involved in this.
you're Kate Renner. Nina's mother.
glad you could make it. - What do you want?
I need a friend inside Duncan's operation.
you're talking to the wrong girl.
okay, a spy.
what are you offering?
just because we're sleeping together, you do not get to treat me like your secretary.
OTI has to end. - You want to dismantle it?
I want to expose it.
OTI is important. Don't give this bastard a chance to take that away from you.
do we really want to bet the future of this country on Dr. Sanders?
or Duncan Carlisle?
they tried and failed. Why should we believe they'll pull it off this time?
Kramer took a photo of a guy talking to the Secret Service agent.
you got a name?
robert Harper. Former Army Ranger and decorated sniper.
sniper?
did you kill him?
I went to his apartment, but he wasn't there.
he's on a plane to New York City right now.
if he's trying to kill you, why is he on his way to New York?
because I'm not the target.
the President is.
he's scheduled to be in New York all day tomorrow.
if they succeed, Nina dies.
then we need to get there first.
the president is gonna be in New York today.
another team is being assembled to take him out while he's there.
we have to stop them. - Hold up there.
how exactly is that on us? - Target goes away, our payday goes away.
our deal is with you. - Your deal is to complete the mission.
we can't do that if somebody beats us to the punch.
so how do we do it?
none of this is your fault.
you didn't ask for this, and you don't deserve it.
but now that we're here, we have to do everything we can to make the right decisions.
we shouldn't be helping these people.
what about when we don't have a choice? - You always have a choice.
mom says we need to cooperate. - Cooperate? Yeah.
not collaborate.
what does that mean? - It means that when this is over I want you to be able to look at yourselves in the mirror.
I don't want to let them turn you into something that you're not.
they made you lie to Boyd's father about his death.
and they made you come up with a phony alibi for Kramer.
where is this gonna end?
with Mom killing the president. - I don't accept that.
and if it does, then...
if it does, then what?
I don't want this family to lose its way.
everybody on your feet. You're coming with us.
let's go. Move! Get up!
move! Up!
text MESSAGE
I'm glad you called.
so all I gotta do is tell you what's going on?
like I said last night, all I need is information.
where people are, what they're doing.
you're my eyes and ears.
I want to know if Duncan's sticking to the plan, that he's watching the Sanders family 24/7.
and, if he's not, call me.
how do I know you're gonna deliver on your end of this?
two Canadian passports. One for you, one for your son.
and what about the cash?
keep it. Consider it a gesture of good faith.
I'll give you the rest when this is all over.
10 grand is nothing to the people I'm working for.
they just wanna know what's going on with Duncan.
it's an insurance policy. That's all.
you made the right decision.
trust me. It's much better than the alternative.
I've gotta get back.
sit down.
windows are nailed shut. Door will be locked from the outside.
you're gonna be in here for a while, so make yourselves comfortable.
what's going on?
none of you are leaving the house today.
I've sent Sandrine and Kramer ahead to start surveillance on this church.
and to look for the sharp shooter we saw yesterday, Robert Harper.
you and I are gonna try and narrow the search.
what do you know about the president's schedule?
off the record trips are low-profile. The goal is to avoid being noticed.
Kincaid will be in an unmarked SUV, without the usual number of Secret Service agents.
they'll most likely bring him through this back alley, here.
why don't we simply call in a bomb threat?
make them divert his plans. - If we do anything to make
kincaid's security detail suspect there's a plot against him, protocol dictates they completely change his itinerary.
that would include the location of his surgery, and the staff performing.
we need to find this other hit team and take them out, without anybody knowing it happened.
Hello, it's Burton. Am I all set on that flight to Madrid?
two tickets.
for myself, and for my granddaughter.
okay. Let me know as soon as possible.
Kate. - Hello, Burton.
come inside.
what are you doing here? I thought we had an arrangement.
I know. I'm sorry.
you shouldn't be here, ever.
a woman came to see me. - Yes?
Dr. Sanders. - Why didn't you tell me Nina was sick?
because...
we always said you would move on with your life and put Nina behind you.
why burden you with her health problems? - She's still my daughter.
I had a right to know. - Is that why you're here, Kate?
I'm here because I want to tell my story.
I want to expose Kincaid.
things in place in New York?
I just spoke to the team leader.
they landed last night. They're assembling now.
everything's a go. - Good.
good. What about the girl? She accept your offer?
she's in.
okay. Stay in contact with her throughout the day.
the minute we're done in New York, we need to be ready to move on Duncan and his team.
I understand. - Duncan needs to go first.
then the others.
what about the Sanders family?
make it a murder-suicide.
a weapon will be left in the father's hand, with a note, bemoaning his financial issues and marital problems.
it's never pleasant taking out innocent civilians, but we don't have a choice.
if I were them, I'd be looking to get some elevation.
only a few structures in the vicinity have the heightened position to give you an angle on that alley.
the sniper team will be looking for a quick exit to a major thoroughfare.
I only see three buildings that fit the bill.
one. Two. Three. - Yeah.
which one will they use? - Don't know yet, but a sniper's only as good as his spotter, and a spotter is only as good as his vantage point.
we need more information.
we don't have enough time to do an internal recon in three high-rise buildings.
you're right.
we need the blueprints for each building with complete specifications.
how are we gonna get those?
after that doctor left, I started thinking about all those secrets I kept, for so long.
I got angry.
I've told my husband everything.
Kate, we had a deal.
and I can only imagine how difficult - these past years... - Decades!
...decades have been for you, but Kincaid's a dangerous man. I don't need to tell you that.
he's a lot more powerful than he was 35 years ago.
I'll take my chances.
I think I'm old enough to make that decision for myself.
what about for Nina?
she's at risk as well.
Nina has terminal leukemia.
according to that doctor, there's no match for her bone marrow, right?
I want my daughter to know the truth before she dies.
we haven't given up.
I need something from you.
I want schematics on three buildings in New York.
schematics? What for? - Your firm has a password for the property clerk's database in most major cities, correct?
Yeah, they do, but I can't access them whenever I want.
it's not that simple. - Why do you need the specs?
it's important to all of us.
well, I'm sorry. There are a lot of regulations.
privacy, security restrictions.
can't help you.
can't? Or won't?
both.
you still haven't learned anything, Brian.
on your feet. Let's go.
mom! - Mom!
where are you taking her?
mom!
you wanted to tell me something?
I think I can get the schematics you need.
good. - But I want to know.
what's it for? I know the president is in New York today.
what are... Are you gonna kill him?
no. I'm gonna save him.
but I need those specs, Ellen. Soon.
here.
if I fail in New York, Ellen, if you hear that the president has been killed, then you need to go upstairs, free your family, and get the hell out of here. Fast.
do you understand what I'm telling you? - Yes.
I know you'll never believe me, but...
I wish you never had to be involved.
thank you for coming.
I was really surprised that you called me.
I thought you guys were in Montreal? Why isn't Brian back at the office?
well, that's why I'm here. Brian...
got himself into some financial trouble. - I don't understand.
well, the company is heavily leveraged. Deeply, deeply in debt.
then about six months ago, he borrowed a large sum of money from some people.
the wrong people. And then when he couldn't pay them back they, they threatened to hurt our family.
what?
that's why he dropped the passports off that day.
we thought we had to get out of the country in a hurry.
why didn't Brian say anything to me?
well, I don't think he wanted to get you involved.
he's out of town right now, but he really needs your help.
we need your help.
I don't blame you for anything that happened.
all I care about right now is protecting my family.
why don't you go to the police?
that would make it even worse. I mean, these people are really dangerous.
they would hurt our kids. - Right.
well, what do you need from me?
your company access code.
we need the schematics for three buildings in New York.
for the business deal, just to help Brian dig himself out of this mess.
this is Nina's sixth birthday party.
and why does the boy standing next to her have frosting all over his face?
Oh, that's Alex. He lived two doors down. Bit of a bully.
Alex made the mistake of trying to take Nina's cupcake, and she shoved it in his face.
so Nina was a tough one?
she still is.
according to the doctors, she should have been dead months ago.
she's a fighter. - You did a wonderful job raising her, Burton.
I would have liked to have been a part of it.
but I'm glad she had you.
she still does. I'll never give up on her.
I just put all of this out of my head for so long.
you, Nina, Kincaid.
now it's just rushing back, like a fresh wound.
and the enormity of what he did to all of our lives.
God, it just makes me so angry.
but in the end, we won.
we beat him. Nina grew up protected from any knowledge of that terrible past.
you forged a new life! You have a husband, a home.
go back to it, Kate. You don't want to stir up any ghosts.
no.
I kept quiet for too long.
you said it yourself. Nina is a fighter.
I wanna show her I'm a fighter too.
text MESSAGE
what's up?
nothing. It's about my son.
was that his father?
no, his father and I don't talk.
sorry. - Don't be.
it's a good thing.
you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
I met him when I was working undercover in Mexico.
it didn't end well.
that's why I don't let my feelings interfere with business.
where do you think they took Mom?
they won't hurt her. They need her for the surgery.
what was that all about?
why do they need building plans?
I'm not sure.
then you should have just given them to him.
it doesn't matter what we do anyway. We can't stop them.
if you believe that, then they've already won.
Morgan, look at me.
they put a bullet in me.
they took over my house. They terrorized my family.
they threatened everything I care about in this world.
and I'm not defeated.
and I'm not going to let them defeat you.
it's not a physical battle.
it's psychological.
so long as we're united, so long as we're together on this.
we're so much stronger than they'll ever be.
it doesn't matter how many guns they have.
look, when this whole thing is over,
I don't want to say goodbye to you.
I understand.
I feel the same way.
if something does happen today, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry we didn't get to spend more time together.
I just don't see why your trip to St. Theodore's should be off the record, Mr. President.
it's a great PR story.
a personal prayer visit to a church built by your great-grandfather?
that's a no-brainer to grab more of the Christian vote.
I spend 90% of my day on empty gestures, Ted.
every once in a while, I have to do something that actually has meaning.
listen. I know I'm a sinner.
I have many flaws.
I make no apologies for most of them.
it's simply my nature.
but I try to make my peace with God, nevertheless.
and if I'm gonna have even the slimmest hope for redemption,
I can't exploit that by turning it into a photo op.
things move fast after an assassination. You recall the chaos when Reagan was shot?
and that was unsuccessful. - First priority.
are we absolutely certain that nothing can be traced back to us or our partners?
there's no direct money trail.
the team we have in place are professionals.
they'll disappear the minute it's over. - And then?
NSA intercepts will be leaked to the press implicating a foreign terrorist cell.
money transfers will point to the involvement of a certain Middle Eastern country.
and the rumor mill will take it from there.
and my sister will never know the truth.
not that she's ever been interested in it.
when will you move on the FBI agent and his team?
as soon as the operation is confirmed.
Wilson. Get a GPS trace up on the phone Carlisle was using to communicate with Logan.
I want you to start monitoring his position.
the rest of his team, too. - Yes, sir!
the foreign terrorist cell is a nice touch.
it will set things up perfectly with the vice president.
when are you speaking with him? - I'm on my way now.
we're going to discuss potential running mates for his presidential campaign.
are you confident you have his ear?
100%.
when I'm finished, you will be at the top of his list.
I think I got everything you asked for.
is there anything else I can do? - No, thank you.
you know, I really admire you.
I do.
the way you're standing by him.
the only reason I got involved with Brian is just the way he described things.
the way, the way things were between you two.
the way things were between us?
he told me that your marriage was a lie.
but clearly that's not the case.
the fact that you're doing all of this for him, even after finding out about us, I,
I admire it and I'm so, so sorry, Ellen.
I'm so sorry. - Thank you, Samantha.
thank you.
sir, I can't track Agent Carlisle's phone.
did you try the girl?
the one Logan has working for us in Duncan's group?
can't reach her. And there's nothing emanating from their burner phones.
they removed their batteries.
start pulling up satellite imagery and running it through facial recognition.
find them. I don't want any loose ends.
why are we switching burners?
the one calling the shots isn't playing games.
if they win today, they'll be looking to get rid of us.
how do you know?
because that's what I would do if I were in their shoes.
what would you pick? - Hard to say from here.
I think we should split up. Search all three.
Kincaid will be here in exactly 72 minutes.
that's not enough time for a proper sweep on one of these buildings.
we need more info.
Ellen should be calling any minute. We wait for her.
I think you're putting way too much faith in her.
I'm not as big a believer.
I have the plans, but they're monsters, like hundreds of pages.
I can't make heads or tails.
okay, Ellen. Find the Widmark Tower.
it has all black sheeting.
I need to know what kind of coating is on the windows.
okay, trying to find it.
focus, Ellen.
all these symbols and markings, it's like hieroglyphics.
what the hell does it matter what glass coating?
they're inside the building, they're not scaling it.
the coating illuminates too much of the light passing through, it's going to be very hard for them to get an accurate view from that distance in the afternoon.
okay, I found it. The glass is high efficiency-rated, triple paint, 33% tint.
then they're not in there. Okay Ellen, the Ormont building.
from street level it looks like it gives a vantage point, but it's built on a corner lot.
find the surveyor's report for the foundation.
I need the exact angle it's built on.
just look for terms like anchor bolts, and rebars, stuff like that.
rebar. Here it is.
engineer's foundation report, 42. 5 degrees.
42 and a half degrees.
that angle, from the highest floors?
shooter would have to press his trigger against the window to get a good look down 25th. Too hard a shot.
building's out.
then that's the building.
the De Soleil Hotel.
okay Ellen, I've gotta go. We don't have much time.
go home, listen to the news. If anything happens...
I know what to do.
good luck.
I feel like I never get to see you anymore, Vanessa.
you were the best staffer I ever had.
a sacrifice of higher office.
you wanted to be vice president.
no, I didn't. But it was clear Paul Kincaid was going to get the nomination, so I just jumped on the ticket.
and as I recall, you're the one who advised me to do it.
politics makes strange bedfellows.
it does indeed.
which is why I want your counsel again.
as you might imagine, people are already beginning to strategize about the election two years from now.
so you've made up your mind to run when Kincaid's second term is up?
it feels awfully early to think about. - It's never too early.
so what about Senator Lansbury as a running mate?
his people have already approached me.
no. - No?
no senators. No representatives.
congress has a single-digit approval rating.
anybody you pick would be poison.
since you were a governor, you can't add another person with a voting record to the ticket.
so where do I look?
you need a fresh face. Not an elected official.
someone with instant name recognition, media appeal and non-partisan credentials.
you'll need international experience to bolster the ticket and, since you're from Texas, you'll need somebody who can deliver the coasts.
I know exactly who you're describing.
I'm not describing anybody in particular, just laying out the facts.
you were always the smartest person in the room.
the only question is, are you interested in running?
Kramer, remember snipers like to work in pairs.
robert Harper will have a spotter.
statistically, he's a white male, 20s, 30s.
probably wearing sunglasses. - Sunglasses?
they like to protect their eyes.
I got nothing. - Next floor. Let's move.
Sandrine, I think we found the spotter.
run room 3609, meet us at the car in five.
are you sure you want to go through with this?
I am.
okay.
well, we might as well do it properly.
I'll go get out my video camera, and we'll tape your statement.
I never knew Nina was so much like her mother, so strong-willed.
you know, I remember one winter, Nina wanted to stand on her sled and go down Franklin Hill.
I told her she could get hurt, and she did.
later, when she was being stitched up at the doctor's office, I thought I should be mad.
but I wasn't. I was just scared.
the thought of something happening to that girl terrified me.
all I wanted was to keep her safe.
and in that moment, I knew that there was nothing that I wouldn't do to protect her for the rest of her life.
I'm asking you, for her sake. Don't do this.
reconsider.
if she is going to die, let her go without knowing the whole, ugly truth.
if you like, I could talk to Nina.
we could change our arrangement.
you would let the two of us meet, face-to-face?
Yes.
okay.
I'll, I'll wait.
I've kept this secret 35 years. I guess I can keep it a little longer.
you have no idea how glad I am you made that decision, Katherine.
ran the room. It was paid in cash, and the name it was registered to had no prior addresses or matching Social Security number.
no doubt it's them. Keep lookout and stay in communication.
get behind the wheel and keep the motor running.
you ready to run 36 floors?
time? - 39 minutes.
let's do it twice.
quick. Quiet. Clean.
clear!
that was the spotter. Where's the shooter?
the spotter's dead. The sniper's gone. - What do you mean, gone?
they aren't taking the hit from the hotel, they're just using it to get an eye on Kincaid.
hold on. Hold on.
I have eyes on the sniper.
robert Harper, he's with another white male.
they're both wearing electric company uniforms.
maintain surveillance. - Copy that.
I've lost them. - Don't move.
what do ya got? - Look at this.
the church is circled. This is their plan.
I'm going to go through the paperwork.
you keep an eye out for Kincaid. He's minutes away.
Hey, Logan, you're a real ball of personality, aren't you?
sorry, Mr. President, I'm just trying to keep us on schedule.
we'll be fine.
sir, I've got a hit on Duncan Carlisle in New York.
23rd and Broadway, 15 minutes ago.
son of a bitch.
he's at the go location.
he's trying to sabotage this whole thing.
president's convoy located. Half click from the church.
I found a public notice about roadwork being done on Broadway and 25th.
an electric company van parked there wouldn't draw any suspicion.
get over there now and take 'em out. - Copy.
got a red light. It'll turn soon though.
they're almost at the church.
beta, this is Charlie. Do you have target confirmation yet?
can't establish comm. - Proceed as planned.
I'll engage the target with my scope, if necessary.
kincaid's arriving.
listen to me.
you have been compromised.
stay frosty, but I want this operation carried out.
copy that, sir. Situation normal here. Only issue is I've lost comm with Beta.
two Canadian passports. One for you, one for your son.
where are you? You need to get to them, and take the shot.
clear to exit vehicle, sir.
you all right? No falling down on the job, Logan.
my sole is split.
I think we promoted you a little too soon, son.
we gotta get out of here.
targets are down.
copy that.
meet you at the rally point.
nice work.
okay, let's go, sweetie.
we don't want to keep that driver waiting.
it's me.
it's over. We did it.
never lost faith that you could pull it off.
see you when you get back.
looks like Aunt Leslie has the flu.
so, we won't be taking that trip, after all.
Really?
but I'll make it up to you with some ice cream.
come on.
then we'll go to the park, and then to the library!
they've been up there all day.
so, did you... - Yes.
we saved him.
mom. - Sweetheart.
where were you? Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
you helped them? - Yeah, Samantha got them for me.
she says hi.
what are you guys talking about?
nothing important, sweetheart.
I can't believe you did it.
no.
we did it.
you came through for me, Ellen.
without you, I don't know what would have happened today.
well, I want you to know...
I'm ready.
to kill the president?
thank you.
thank you.
don't move!
you need to be careful around Sandrine.
I think she might be selling us out.
to who? - Logan.
we're going to eliminate a few loose ends.
a few? - Duncan, Archer and Kramer.
what do I have to do?
they're shaped charges.
they're small, powerful, and untraceable.
I need you to attach one to each vehicle.
how did your meeting go with the Vice President?
he said he would be lucky as hell to have someone like you as his running mate.
you need a fresh face. Not an elected official.
someone with instant name recognition.
I know exactly who you're describing.
the only question is, are you interested in running?
you're telling me that the President is...
your biological father.
and my husband, is holding your family hostage?
if my family dies, it's on you! Not your father, not your husband, you!
I told her everything. She's the only one, that can stop this...
I need to tell him I won't do it.
I talked to Brian Sanders.
he told me what's going on, what you've done to his family, what you're planning.
is it true?
so?
is Brian Sanders telling the truth?
have you taken his family hostage?
Nina, you need to get back into bed and rest.
don't you dare patronize me. I asked you a question.
Yes.
I didn't have a choice.
Nina... - Get away from me!
I'm trying to save your life.
our family.
this was the only way. - This?
killing the President?
it didn't start there.
I don't care where it started. - I made a deal.
kill a bad man to save a good woman.
right or wrong, I was willing to live with it.
and what about me?
did you ever wonder if I would be okay with that?
I want to live.
I do.
more than anything.
but I would rather die with my dignity, than live with the shame, the disgust, of knowing what you did.
if this is your miracle cure, I don't want it.
this has to stop. Now.
it's not that simple, Nina.
sure it is.
what are you doing?
I'm getting the hell out of here.
the bombs are in place.
when you gonna detonate them? - When Kincaid is dead.
and the cars are far enough away from the Sanders' house.
has Duncan told you his exit plan?
we're meeting at a rest stop off I-95.
two hours after the President is declared dead.
Duncan's gonna give us the wire transfer information there, we'll part ways.
rest stop. That's good.
we'll take care of it there.
when do I get my money and my passports?
right after your partners are dead.
right before would be better.
trust isn't my strong suit.
okay. Before.
spoke with Duncan.
he wanted you to know, Sandrine took the bait.
leaked the fact that you two are surveilling a federal prosecutor.
how do we know she's the leak?
I mean, these guys got lots of contacts. Lots of resources.
I told D we should leave you out of this conversation.
that you couldn't handle the facts.
I'm just saying,"Why?" Why would they be paying her to spy on us?
we want the same thing. We're on the same team.
we want the same thing, but we are most definitely not on the same team.
when this is over, they're gonna try and take us out.
and Sandrine'll be the one who'll do it.
so as much as I like her, she's gotta go.
duncan said that? - Yeah.
but we gotta figure out how she's planning to kill us before we make a move.
in the meantime, play it cool, act like everything's normal.
you gotta keep your feelings out of this, man.
it's just business.
so, you ready for this?
Yeah, positive. It's the only way. - Good.
now, talk to Duncan as soon as he gets back.
Yeah, but I want you to be there.
Absolutely.
I just want you to know, when this is over...
let's just get through this, okay?
but you raised me.
you're my father.
how could you not tell me the truth?
I was trying to protect you. That's all I've ever tried to do.
then protect me now.
fix this.
I'm afraid I can't. - I don't accept that.
it's complicated, Nina.
you're both insane.
I cannot believe this is actually happening.
Sawyer, honey, what are you doing up?
I heard all these people talking.
mommy.
I'm sorry, honey. We didn't mean to wake you.
I don't care.
I'm just glad that you're out of the hospital.
that means that you're not sick anymore.
I love you so much.
I love you.
you go back to bed, okay? It's really late.
I'll take her.
come on, sweetheart. I'll read you a story. Let's race.
come on. Come on.
she's the reason we're doing this.
she deserves to have a mother.
she deserves to have you in her life.
she deserves to have a father who's not a murderer.
I'm calling the police.
I'm ending it.
I'm sorry.
but you're not calling anyone.
you need to calm down.
I need to get out of here. - That's not an option.
what?
you're not thinking clearly right now.
there's a lot to absorb.
I think you should stay here until this is over.
you're gonna lock me in?
Duncan! Open the door.
what are you doing?
have you lost your mind?
I am your wife!
open the door now! Duncan!
thank you, everybody.
followed your advice.
didn't mention a word to the Attorney General about my political aspirations.
just kept it light and breezy.
light and breezy can get you a long way in this town.
that's what I hear.
I'm going to meet my sister.
how is she? - Worried about Paul.
doesn't like the idea of him going in to surgery, so, she wants to spend the day together.
she thinks I'm her good luck charm.
I think she might be wrong about that.
everything's still on track?
I spoke with Duncan last night.
all systems go.
in 48 hours, things will be a lot different.
the future of this country will be in our hands.
Where's Sandrine? - With Kramer.
they left together last night.
you find anything? - Nada.
no clue how she plans to do this.
not too many options.
either she's gonna clip us in person, or set us up.
Yeah. About that. I've been thinkin'.
if Sandrine is working for the other side and their plan is to get rid of us, what makes you think they're gonna pay up when this is over?
money's already been wired.
it's being held by a third party, someone Creasy and I agreed upon months ago.
the moment the President dies, he'll send me the account information.
so as long as Dr. Sanders comes through, we're good.
we're good.
then let's make sure homegirl delivers.
been a long few weeks.
I didn't come all this way for a kiss on the cheek, you know what I mean?
she'll come through.
she better. Otherwise, I'll put a bullet in her eye.
what?
we need to talk about the surgery.
I've changed my mind. I'm not gonna kill him.
that's not an option, Ellen.
I'm not gonna do it. - We have an agreement.
well, things have changed.
there are consequences to that decision.
and I am prepared to face them.
look, I know you're doing this to save your wife.
and despite your threats, you're not gonna kill my kids.
I know it and you know it.
you're right.
I won't kill them.
but that doesn't matter.
other people involved will.
Plus, Archer and Sandrine are in this for the money.
they won't hesitate to finish you off if you don't go through with this.
we understand the risks. And we have a proposal for you.
I'm listening.
I'll find a way to get the President's bone marrow, if you protect my children.
I'm not sure that's even possible.
do you want to save your wife? It's the only offer on the table.
okay.
but we want proof that you'll protect our kids.
proof?
I hate to break it to you, but your word isn't worth much around here.
what do you have in mind?
only two days left, are you planning on a lot of wardrobe changes or something?
what's the matter?
nothing.
we have a little time.
not right now, sorry.
should I be insulted?
I'm stressed. I can't turn it on and off like you can.
when this is over, I hope we can keep this going.
you. Me. And my son.
I think you'd really like him.
well, if he's anything like his mother...
look.
things are crazy right now. Everyone's worried about the other side of this.
sometimes...
people do something in the moment that seems to make sense, but later on doesn't.
what are you saying?
if you did do something, or promise something, that no longer makes sense, there's still time to undo it.
if you made a mistake, I'd be willing to forgive you.
but Duncan and Archer...
they wouldn't.
can I help you?
Yeah, I,called about your rental place here. It's for a friend of mine.
needs a little peace and quiet.
well, how long's your friend wanna stay for?
a week.
your friend have a name?
$60 a night, no smoking.
deal. Cash okay?
can I help you?
are you Burton Delaney? - Yes.
I'm looking for Nina Carlisle. You have any idea where she might be?
you're looking for Nina? - Yes.
I'm Dr. Kagan. One of her oncologists.
I heard she just checked herself out of the hospital late last night?
look, I'm concerned.
her immune system's very weak right now. - I know.
it's, it's been a terrible situation, as you might imagine.
she and her husband made the decision together.
so she's at her home? - Yes.
but I was just there, it was empty.
she's probably sleeping.
Mr. Delaney, it's very important that I speak with your daughter.
I want her to go back to the hospital.
I understand.
I'll track her down and have a talk with her.
grandpa?
I wanna play with Mommy. Is she done with her nap?
Sawyer, please, I'm just finishing up with Mommy's doctor.
I just wanted to see her.
I'm confused. Is Nina here?
Sawyer? Are you there?
no. She's at her home in Bethesda.
we're going to visit her later today, when she's feeling up to it.
sorry to disturb you.
no, it's not a problem.
thank you for dropping by.
why did you lie to the doctor?
I was trying to help your mother.
sometimes we have to say certain things that aren't true to protect the people we love.
nice.
when the President's dead, and we get paid, I'm gonna live life, brother.
buy a boat. Get a place out in Florida, near the water.
still got some work to do.
Yeah, I know.
but it's not illegal to dream, is it?
so about Sandrine, I've been thinking, it's not that easy to take out three armed men.
no matter how good you are.
what are you sayin'?
if I were them, I'd try to be more efficient.
get us all at once.
away from the house.
we should check the cars.
thank you.
thanks for coming by, Colonel.
of course. It's my pleasure, Mr. Vice President.
I'll cut to the chase.
Vanessa Moore and I have been talking.
she mentioned that you two are good friends.
is that right?
spoke very highly of you.
well, that's good to hear. Vanessa's an amazing woman.
and one of the smartest people I know.
and a very capable politician.
so, the reason I called you here, Colonel...
it's no secret that I'm going to run for President when Paul's term expires.
and I think that Vanessa would be a perfect running mate.
in your estimation, do you believe she's someone I can trust?
thanks for coming over. - What the hell's going on?
your sister wants to go to the police. She won't listen to us.
you need to reason with her.
Oh, thank God.
I don't even know where to begin.
you're in on this too.
how did they talk you into this?
it was my decision. Nobody talked me into anything.
we need to end it.
look, I don't care what's already happened, there's nothing we can do about that.
but we have to go to the police. Right now.
we can't. - Why not?
because of the President. - What, you mean my father?
your father doesn't know you're alive.
and your very existence is a threat to him, to his whole hypocrisy.
I'm not very worried about him.
what's he gonna do to me?
kill me?
I'm practically dead as it is.
well, what about Sawyer?
it's the same DNA.
she could bring him down just as easily as you could.
you're not making any sense.
he raped your mother 35 years ago, then tried to have her killed to cover it up, if he finds out the truth, he will eliminate any and all evidence that it ever happened.
that includes you and Sawyer.
so please, just stay here.
and let Duncan try to help you.
what are you guys doing?
I'm worried our partners might try to take us out when this is over.
makes sense. If you think about it.
no upside to letting us live, right?
so, we need to be alert.
make sure they haven't planted anything on the vehicles.
got it.
what made you think that they want to get rid of us?
intuition.
cars are clean, D. - You sure?
positive.
good. So what should we do next? Sweep the house?
already did.
maybe I should check the house again.
how'd it go?
how do you think?
she's mad as hell.
one day she'll thank us. - You really think so?
I do.
I have to.
otherwise, what's the point?
let's get this done.
get the family together.
until the President's surgery is complete, I want the kids locked in the basement, blindfolded.
we're not taking any chances.
what the hell? No! - Keep your mouth shut and listen!
we made a deal, Ellen. Kill the President, or we kill you and your family.
I intend to honor that agreement.
but you said that... - A deal's a deal.
take 'em away.
let's go.
get your hands off him. - No.
No! Jake! - Oh my God!
Oh no. Oh no!
they killed Jake!
do you want me to kill the other one too?
Oh, no. Oh my God!
dammit!
we need to move fast in case one of the neighbors heard anything.
you two get outside and make sure the coast is clear.
Kramer and I will clean this up.
get her out of here. Now. What are you waiting for? Move!
fast!
No!
this is what happens when you don't listen.
what just happened? - I don't know.
the kid is only 15. I think Duncan lost it.
kid grabbed a weapon. He didn't have a choice.
this kind of pressure's tough to take. It can make a person do something stupid.
are we good to move?
Yeah. All quiet outside.
I know Duncan is your friend, but maybe we should get out of this.
both of us. Before it's too late.
it already is.
fridge all stocked? - You're all set.
your friend won't have to leave for a week, just like you asked.
did it work? - You did great.
stay out of sight for the next two days, Jake.
your mom and dad will send you a message on this phone with instructions on where to meet them when this is over.
what happens if something goes wrong and I don't hear from you guys?
if you don't hear from us, then you run and you don't stop.
do you understand?
come on, Jake. I'll give you a tour of your home for the next couple days.
Morgan, your brother is okay, your brother is okay, he's not dead. He's not dead.
what?
we don't have much time so just listen to me.
your father and I made a deal with Duncan.
it was too much of a risk to tell you in advance.
it had to seem 100% real. - Real? For who?
archer and Sandrine. Duncan and Kramer have their own reason for doing this.
they don't want to hurt us, but Archer and Sandrine are different.
now we're going to get you out of here too, before I operate on the President, so you'll be safe no matter what.
I don't understand. Where's Jake?
in hiding. We sent him first.
because... Because you're stronger.
you just need to keep it together a couple more days, can you do that?
I'm so sorry to put you through all this.
just promise me that we are going to be okay at the end of this.
we will. I promise.
I'm so sorry.
about that private matter, sir.
shut the door.
you asked me to let you know if there was anything unusual about Duncan Carlisle's personal or professional life.
what is it? - His wife.
apparently she checked herself out of the hospital last night, suddenly, without her doctor's consent.
they're looking for her, but she's off the grid.
nobody is off the grid to the NSA.
your decision not to kill Kincaid has made everything more complicated.
it also creates a problem getting the bone marrow out of the hospital.
Logan was going to smuggle it out for us, but once he realizes the President's gonna live, Logan won't help us.
and then the Secret Service will search me when I leave the OR.
exactly.
we need to find another way.
Sawyer? Is that you?
mommy? Are you awake?
hey baby, yeah, I'm awake.
grandpa told me not to bother you.
no, no, you've been a really good girl.
I had a nice nap and I feel much better now.
are you coming out? - Yeah...
but I locked the door by accident.
Oh, I'll go get Grandpa. - No... Don't bother Grandpa.
I just... I need you to do something for me.
met with Dr. Sanders. All systems go.
good. Did you get what I asked for?
Yes.
Thanks. I'll handle it from here.
everything will be in place on the day.
Colonel, hello.
good to see you. I had a surprise meeting today.
with the Vice-President.
Really? How'd it go?
he asked me an interesting question.
he wanted to know if I thought you were trustworthy.
I hope you said yes. - 'Course I did.
I'm a good liar.
excuse me?
you're a very clever woman, Vanessa, but the game isn't over.
where are you?
why are we here?
we need these guys' help. They'll create a diversion on the day of the surgery.
you sure you don't want to wear a wire?
too risky.
it's risky not to wear one.
want me to quiz you?
no, I'm good. I know this cover inside out.
you're here to watch my back, but don't interfere unless things go south.
copy that.
this has to work, so be patient.
how patient?
wait for a gunshot.
that's not patient. That's stupid.
I told our leader all about your plan. He's excited.
good.
this is the guy I was telling you about. Donald Carter.
nice to meet you. Heard good things.
steve says you guys did some business a few months back.
Yeah, a few deals, we got to know each other a little bit.
that's why I came to you.
I'm flattered.
what I meant was we both share a similar philosophy about the government and the President.
I'm told you have a plan already in place.
I've been working on this for a few months, but I'm still shorthanded.
I need a few more smart, skilled men, and we can do the unthinkable.
we can take down the President of the United States.
tell me more.
I have a mole in the Secret Service, gave me everything.
times, security codes, rotations, you name it.
that sounds good.
too good.
usually that means there's a cop involved.
you calling me a snitch?
he's legit, man. We've done a lot of work together.
we're gonna run your information, make sure you are who you say you are.
sawyer and I are leaving. Please don't try and follow us.
please, just let her live somewhere else.
away from you and all the craziness.
I loved you my whole life. You broke my heart.
okay. Let's go.
wait, where are we going? Trains are that way.
I know.
you didn't tell me you did time in federal prison. Gun trafficking.
you didn't ask. And it was a narcotics charge.
methamphetamines.
Oh yeah? What cell block were you in?
look, you don't wanna be a part of this, that's fine with me.
but I'm done answering questions.
Oh, I didn't give you permission to leave.
I don't ask permission.
so either you shoot me or I walk away.
wait, wait, wait. Come on.
okay.
I'm interested.
you got balls, man, I'll give you that, but it doesn't mean you're gonna be able to get close enough to the President to pull this off.
now, it's all well and good to know the security plan.
what makes you think we can get past it?
I was hoping you'd ask that question.
secret Service lapel pins.
they change color every day.
those are the correct ones to get us past security the day after tomorrow.
like I've been trying to say, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
went in to check on you. Was close.
I hope you at least considered shooting the son of a bitch.
you told me to be patient. It all worked out.
for us, anyway. - What do you mean?
Billy doesn't know it yet, but he and his boys just signed up for a suicide mission.
they're the diversion.
Nina and Sawyer are gone.
let's get the hell out of here.
Dr. Sanders. - Madam First Lady.
thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
you said you wanted to speak in private.
I hope it's nothing serious.
as you may recall, I did some blood work on your husband a few days ago.
and I came upon something unexpected.
something I wanted to bring to your attention.
go on.
your husband has a genetic marker which could indicate he is susceptible to early onset dementia.
very few people know about this marker.
it was only identified in a medical journal last month.
but I think further testing would be the logical next step.
have you spoken to Paul about this, and the White House physician?
no, but I plan to. I thought I should speak with you first.
obviously this is a very sensitive issue in the case of the President.
if people find out he's being tested for any form of cognitive impairment, well, I assume that's the kind of thing you'd want to keep private.
you were right to come to me.
I appreciate your candor and your discretion.
as his doctor, I would feel irresponsible not recommending further testing.
but if we go through the official channels, I find it hard to believe we could keep it secret.
do you have an alternative proposal?
his upcoming surgery presents a unique opportunity.
I believe I could take a blood sample without drawing attention, but I would need help getting it out of the hospital into a private lab.
it would require someone who is capable of walking through security without being searched.
someone like you, Madam First Lady.
you see anybody else in here reading the newspaper?
or anywhere else, for that matter.
so... How does this work?
it works like this.
Mr. Delaney's paying me a nice chunk of cash to help you guys disappear, so if you don't want him to waste his money, I suggest you listen.
carefully.
in this envelope you will find new identities, documents, instructions, keys to a new house and a new life, but none of that will be worth a damn if you don't follow one simple rule.
leave your past behind.
for how long? I mean, I just got accepted into college.
you mean Morgan Sanders got accepted to college.
morgan Sanders doesn't exist anymore.
don't worry, honey. - You'll start over.
listen to your father. There's only one reason to do this.
because you don't have a choice.
she called me from a payphone at DC National Station.
I'll get down there and see if I can track 'em down.
good. - At least she didn't go to the police.
if she had, they'd be here by now.
she's running.
I'll call a friend at the Bureau.
Hey, Mike, how you doin'?
good. Good, good. Listen. I need a favor.
it's kind of embarrassing, but I got myself into a bit of a mess at home.
my wife and I have been struggling lately, and...
well, she took off with my daughter.
as you can imagine, I'd rather keep this off the record, but I need a hand in tracking them down.
cross-atlantic airlines, flight 733.
final boarding at gate four.
Nina Carlisle? - Yes?
follow us. We need to ask you a few questions.
nice to meet you, Mrs. Carlisle.
my name is Thomas Blair.
you're playing a dangerous game, Colonel.
your wife and daughter will be released the second our friend on Pennsylvania Avenue is dead.
what the hell is going on?
I apologize for the inconvenience, ma'am.
call Blair right now and tell him to release my wife and daughter.
he won't do it. Blair doesn't trust me anymore.
no matter how this surgery plays out tomorrow,
Blair is a problem for both of us.
he is not an easy man to kill. - That's why you need my help.
I ran a test on the President's blood.
his bone marrow is the perfect match for your wife.
she's the President's daughter, isn't she?
you'll need to kill him.
and then save him.
it's the only way to get Logan to play ball, but getting the President's bone marrow doesn't mean a damn thing if we can't get it out of the hospital.
we keep this private.
for now. Just you and me.
how do I get the blood sample?
well, when the surgery is over,
I'll have someone bring you into the operating room, and I'll hand it to you.
you remember Dr. Evans, my personal physician?
I'll be at the President's side until the surgery's completed.
happy to have you.
we need these guys'help.
they'll create a diversion on the day of the surgery.
I'm told you have a plan already in place.
we can take down the President of the United States.
tell me more.
once the President flatlines, we're going to need five minutes alone with the body.
we need to create a crisis inside the hospital, while you're operating on the President.
I left a bag.
inside there's a smoke grenade.
stick it inside the fire extinguisher case closest to the operating room.
Hey, Jake! What's the matter?
Oh, God.
you guys aren't goin' anywhere until the President's dead.
t
you ready?
Yes.
things will move fast in that operating room, so you need to be ready.
I've been through this. I know what to do.
right.
after it's over, what's going to happen?
follow the plan.
collect your things, then leave town.
eventually you'll meet up with your family.
but you're certain that Brian and the kids got away?
Yes.
there's no reason to keep us hostage.
the mission is over.
Ellen is not gonna kill the President.
duncan lied to you.
I don't believe you.
how else do you explain Jake still being alive?
all I know is there's something else going on.
duncan wouldn't change the plan.
if Ellen doesn't kill the President, it puts us all at risk.
including Duncan.
which is why you should take off.
disappear, before this whole thing falls apart.
still not too late.
no.
I'm not walking away from this payday.
there is no payday.
better hope you're wrong about that, Bri.
m
how will we know who the inside man is?
he'll know who we are.
honey, why don't you take that into the other room to watch.
okay.
I demand to speak to my husband.
I know he's the one behind all of this.
you will speak with him. In fact, that's why I'm here.
how long does he think he can keep us locked up this way?
not much longer.
I assure you.
if he delivers on his promise, you and your daughter will be free to leave by the end of the day.
what promise?
that's not your concern, Mrs. Carlyle.
all you need to do right now is get on the phone with him, and let him know you're all right.
Hello, Duncan.
they're both fine.
you have one minute as agreed.
Duncan... - Nina, are you and Sawyer okay?
Where's Sawyer? - She's fine.
she's in the next room. What is going on?
why are these men holding us?
what did you get us involved in?
everything is going to be all right. I promise you.
how can you say that?
Nina, I'm so sorry.
I just need you to be strong a little longer.
all right?
let me talk to Sawyer.
you can talk to them both after our business is concluded.
and then you can all live happily ever after.
you don't really think that son of a bitch intends to let them go, do you?
no.
but we're going to convince him.
what time will Blair arrive at the event?
about an hour or so.
what type of security will he have around him?
he only has one personal security officer, an ex-Special Ops soldier named Wilson.
you'll need to distract him.
okay.
I wish we didn't have to do this.
he's holding my wife and daughter hostage, you'll excuse me if I don't show much sympathy for him.
this is personal for you.
like President Kincaid is for me.
I thought it was political.
for Blair.
I believe the President's death is a matter of justice.
don't you agree?
Absolutely.
I'm just concerned about the proximity to this rib here, can you pull up another image?
madam First Lady.
the President just went into pre-op.
actually I would like to speak with you.
alone.
I've done some further reading, Dr. Sanders.
the genetic marker for dementia that you claimed you found in my husband's blood.
one lab in the country runs the test for that, and his blood wasn't sent there.
which means you've been lying.
you have exactly one minute to explain yourself, before I open that door and have Secret Service arrest you.
m - Yes? - Everything all set?
Yes, everything's in motion.
we're with the blue team.
glad you could make it.
clear the south hall of civilian personnel.
you two are on the stairwell. - Copy that, sir.
nervous?
Why? Just another day at work.
see you in there.
almost there, sir.
this way.
Mr. President, you remember your anesthesiologist, Dr. Carp.
he's currently administering a general anesthetic, so you may feel some drowsiness, numbness, that's totally normal.
now I want you to count backwards from 100 for me.
it's your sister.
uh, I just found out something...
important.
it's essential that we speak as soon as possible.
call me.
Yes.
we're in position.
excuse me?
do you work for that guy?
who is he? - Why?
I saw something weird earlier and I don't know who to report it to.
there was a guy taking video of him.
and I know we're not supposed to take pictures in here.
and the guy hid his camera as soon as I got close.
who was the guy?
it was one of the waiters, but I've never seen him at work before.
can you point him out to me? - Yeah.
retractor.
scalpel.
vitals are stable.
thank you.
forceps, please.
nicely done, Dr. Sanders.
very clean.
just a little bit more and we'll have all of it.
where are we going?
Colonel.
excuse me.
I know that you think I undermined you with the Vice-President, but you're wrong.
this is all a misunderstanding.
Really?
he misinterpreted my offer to advise him, but I've set the record straight.
I told him flat out that I don't want the job, and that you are the candidate I wanted to put forward.
you really expect me to believe you?
no, don't take it from me.
talk to the Vice-President yourself.
he wants to sit down with you before he gives his speech.
now?
I suggested that you might have some policy ideas for him.
and, um...
who better to be sitting next to in the next hour when the news comes in.
I don't know what your game is.
but I'm willing to play along.
there's a shortcut through the kitchen.
I want my wife and daughter back.
I'm sorry.
you are making a mistake.
we're not enemies.
I want the President dead because he is a danger to our country.
I have no reason to hurt your family and I will release them.
as soon as the job is complete.
well, I don't feel like waiting.
take out your phone, and make the call.
otherwise, I'll put a bullet in your head.
more retraction, please.
what is that?
we got a bleeder.
clamp.
you applied too much retraction, nurse.
looks like he's ruptured an artery.
I don't know what happened.
Dr. Sanders, do something.
he could bleed out.
get some suction in here.
Tachi to 120.
how's his blood pressure?
that's the signal.
keep the suction in there.
what the hell was that?
how's his blood pressure?
IV wide open. - Give me the air check.
Yes, sir.
agent Logan.
where is that smoke coming from? What are you doing?
I got this Keep your eyes on the President.
I can't locate the bleeder.
madam First Lady, come with me.
this way.
let's go. Let's go.
we have a biochem agent.
repeat. We have detected a biochem attack.
shut down hospital power immediately.
I can't see a thing as it is.
what are you going to do?
he's losing pressure.
I need to locate the bleeder.
get the gauze in there.
keep the suction in.
shut down the power.
glow sticks, mark the exits.
automatic weapons, let's go.
glow sticks.
backup generator's on.
agent Logan. What's happening?
keep the gauze in there.
apply some pressure.
110 over 80. - Okay, pull this down.
we need to move the President.
we can't.
the President is bleeding out.
he could die. - Do it.
I'm not going to ask you again, move him!
let's go.
Yeah. - It's me.
I got them.
they're safe.
this is WUSA reporting live with breaking news from Maryland College Hospital, where President Kincaid is currently undergoing surgery.
okay, bag him.
bag him.
come on. Come on. Let's go. Everyone, let's go.
cover both doors. - Sir.
Ricky, frequency alpha.
what's frequency alpha?
we're on frequency alpha, go ahead.
we've been compromised.
hostiles are disguised as agents.
we are changing security protocol.
new identify password is "kingmaker.
copy that. New identify password "kingmaker.
listen up, new identify password is "kingmaker.
get the exits.
let's go. You two on the south exit, let's go.
he's crashing.
get his pressure up. - Get him out of here, now!
identify yourselves.
what's the password?
password?
password. What is the password?
move it. Move it, come on!
they're getting close.
lock those doors.
what's the password?
what password?
everyone out this way, go.
come on, let's go. I got it. - Go. Go. Go now.
get him back in. Get him back in here.
protect these doors at all costs.
let nobody in this room, you understand?
we're alone. Now make sure he's dead.
we're alone. Now make sure he's dead.
don't you die on me.
okay. Okay.
you can do this.
an unknown number of terrorists have attacked the hospital where President Kincaid is undergoing surgery.
sounds to me like it's going down.
it's all part of a diversion to get the bone marrow.
the status of the President is not yet known, but we are hearing reports that the attack occurred on the same floor as the President's operating room and that biochemical agents may be involved.
so, can I go now?
your wife and daughter are safe.
we're not finished.
I hold no grudge about the back and forth between us.
you have no reason to hold a grudge against me.
except for the fact that you planned to eliminate me all along.
that is not true.
Really?
then why did you pay her to plant bombs underneath our vehicles?
tell me that.
I switched sides.
I'm sorry.
you picked the wrong side.
we're not going to spend the rest of our lives, looking over our shoulders.
I'm afraid you've left me with no choice, Colonel.
hello. - I just heard the news on the radio, from the hospital.
is this all part of your plan?
is the President going to die because of me?
no.
I don't believe you.
that's not going to happen.
promise me.
I want to hear you say it.
promise me that nobody else dies by your hand.
I promise.
can't see a thing...
gotcha.
you don't have to do this.
there is an alternative.
we make a video tape.
together.
a statement that explains what we have done, and implicates both of us.
if anything happens to either one of us, release the tape.
you can't trust him.
we don't need to trust each other. That's the point.
the tape is the guarantee that neither one of us will ever speak or come after the other one.
there's been enough killing.
get him out of here and let's do this.
all right, move.
it's clear!
blue team, cover that room.
entry team, get this room open!
check the President.
the President is stable.
you saved him.
air is clear. No sign of biochem agents.
must've been a faulty sensor.
turn the power back on.
sir.
let me get you.
what happened to Agent Logan?
Oh, he just passed out.
must've been the smoke.
agent Logan, the President's safe.
he's gonna be fine.
come on, sir. Let's get you checked out.
is he all right? - He's stable.
Dr. Sanders, I want to thank you.
what you did today was nothing short of heroic.
we are just getting reports that President Kincaid has survived the attack on the hospital.
he was barricaded in the operating room during the siege.
and President Kincaid is expected... - Shut it off.
all we want is our lives back.
duncan agreed to set you free.
that was the deal he made with Ellen?
was it?
Yeah.
start the car.
we're going for a ride.
Dr. Sanders?
Dr. Sanders, wait.
the First Lady wanted you to have this.
as a token of her gratitude.
I have it. I have the bone marrow.
I'm taking it to Nina now.
I can't believe you pulled it off, Ellen.
thank you.
it's over now.
I'll meet you at Burton's.
it'll be over for me when I'm with my kids.
soon.
let's just talk about this.
stop here.
get down on your knees.
close your eyes.
why are you doing this? - Do as you're told!
Hey, it's me.
I caught Brian and Morgan trying to escape.
gonna bring 'em by the house, finish this.
this It Archer, leave a message. - Archer, hey.
it's me, Duncan. Listen to me.
don't do anything to the family until I get there, you hear me?
wait for me. I'm on my way.
Archer! - Hey, D.Where are Brian and Morgan?
Where's my money?
things didn't go as planned.
Really?
I thought this was your plan.
what are you talking about? No.
lie to an old friend, recruit him for a payday you never intend to collect.
then hang him out to dry. - It's not like that.
I...I never meant for things to go down this way.
I planned to go through with it to the very end, but when Ellen refused, I had to make a choice.
and you chose to betray me.
I'll make it up to you.
I swear.
you should've told me the truth, D.
I'm sorry.
all I ever gave you was my loyalty.
I'm sorry.
Dr. Sanders.
is that it? - Yeah.
so just bring it to the hospital and give it to your doctors, and when they test it, they'll find it's a near-perfect match.
you can beat this disease, Nina.
I owe you an apology.
what my husband did to you and to your family.
you don't owe me an apology.
you didn't ask for any of this.
what he did was wrong.
and I don't know if I can accept this.
you need to do what's right for you.
Duncan. What happened?
are you all right?
where are Nina and Sawyer?
upstairs. Listen, we don't have much time.
here's some cash and a new passport.
you should get out of the country tonight.
Burton, I'm not running.
what?
give us a minute.
Oh, my God. You need to see a doctor.
I am.
how bad is it?
you'll survive.
Blair is dead.
I don't think anybody's going to be looking for you.
so...
this is it. - Yeah.
this is it.
we made it.
no, you made it.
that's the difference between us.
you got through this entire thing without ever losing yourself.
I wish I could say the same.
goodbye, Ellen.
How're you feeling, Paul?
a little weak, but happy to be alive.
we'll see about that.
Nina... - Don't.
just don't.
I'm so sorry. I really...
there is no justification for what you did.
I understand.
but I'm going back to the hospital tomorrow with the bone marrow.
I want to live.
thank you. - I'm not doing it for you.
I'm not even doing it for me.
I just couldn't face the idea of telling Sawyer that you weren't coming home.
I couldn't do it.
she thinks you walk on water.
what am I supposed to tell her, Duncan?
the truth.
I love you.
daddy! - Hey, sweetheart.
what happened to your eye?
Oh, it's nothing. Just...
just got into a little accident.
I want to tell you something.
daddy has to go away. - For how long?
it might be a while.
but what about my birthday?
you have to be back for my birthday.
I already got you a present.
it's Mommy coming back.
thank you, Daddy.
I love you.
I love you, too.
more than anything.
Dr. Sanders told me what happened with you and Kate Renner.
how could she know about...
it was decades ago.
Mary, you couldn't possibly believe... - Oh, but I do.
suddenly, it's all clear to me.
your cheating, your ambition...
I thought you had limits, but I was wrong.
you had Peter killed, didn't you?
my own brother.
who put that idea in your head?
I did.
I've defended you for too long.
but not anymore.
you're going to have to pay for your crimes, Paul.
you going somewhere?
what are you doing here?
could I catch a ride?
you don't even know where I'm going.
where are you going?
I'm going to see my son.
then I guess I'll keep moving after that.
works for me.
you're a good person, Kramer.
a lot better than me.
I'm not sure we belong together.
well, there's only one way to find out.
you're crazy, you know that? - Yeah.
we should both go in. - No.
this is on me.
besides, I need you to look after Nina and Sawyer.
she won't forgive me. - She will.
in time.
but even if she doesn't... - It's still my job to look after them.
I know.
what are you doing back here?
I thought you were gone.
archer left us at a warehouse and we hitched a ride to the nearest bus station.
we couldn't leave without you.
we wanted to go as a family.
I don't expect anything.
me either.
sounds like a plan.
my name is Duncan Carlisle.
I'm here to surrender.
welcome back, Mr Hutchinson. - Good to be back, Mr Edwards.
come work with me.
Charlie, it is time to do something for yourself.
I think you should take it. - Take what？
Hutch's job.
he's not bad. We'll be in safe hands.
jackie: You're in way over your head.
first, they're gonna come after you and then they're gonna come after me.
I won't mess it up again if you give me another chance.
I need you and I want to be with you. - I'm sorry.
Babylon's a special place. I feel I've spent half my life here.
I'm sorry, what are you saying？ - You're leaving, too, aren't you？
Yes.
Tony: It doesn't matter who we are or where we come from,
we never know who's gonna spin through that door, and what you might ask of us.
it's a bit like being an actor.
there's so many different roles we have to play.
sometimes you need us to be a magician.
front row, dress circle.
both: Thanks!
and sometimes you need us to be a fashion consultant.
the black. Definitely the black.
we need to be part conman and part showman.
this is a lovely Burgundy, vintage 1926.
it was once owned by Her Majesty's, the Queen of England.
Tony: We have to learn to be adaptable, to switch from one role to another, in an instant.
we're your garrulous drinking buddy...
but I love her. I do. I really love her.
...your marriage guidance counsellor...
so talk to her. Tell her how you feel.
stop shagging your PA.
...and your nursemaid.
we're everything you need us to be at any given moment.
hold me, Mummy.
although some roles are beyond the call of duty, these skills can't be taught or learnt from a training manual.
it doesn't matter whether you've got a GCSEs, a BSc. And an MBA.
we've learnt the hard way, through experience.
if a member of staff's promoted to general manager before they've had a chance to get that experience, they'd better learn fast.
cause you just know when you're looking at the one.
and you feel it in your fingers. And you feel it in your toes.
my toes are telling me I'm looking at her right now.
cut!
Katie, that was great. It was fantastic.
why are you staring at Tom's forehead？ - Exactly.
you know, I think there's Botox leaking out of it.
bitch! Such a bitch.
Simon, can we please do something about Katie's breath？
rob. - Can we fly in some mints for Katie？
or a fire extinguisher？
I'm just saying what I read. It's all over the Internet.
right, I'll be in my suite.
okay, let's take five, everyone, then set up for the wide, please.
thank you.
so I would like each of you to take on board my own personal mantra, "The customer is always right."
the customer comes first.
the customer is God.
Oh, God. Come on, you can... You can do this.
the customer is...
crap.
did you see that boy playing me？ He was as wooden as a pencil.
I can act better than that.
Oh, could this film crew be any messier？
I'm gonna ask the director for a part in the film.
do you know, I was nearly an actress.
this producer asked me to give him a private audition for his Bond film,
licence to Drill.
I was going to be a nuclear physicist, Dr Goodhead.
this came for you while they were filming.
Oh, my God.
Ned wants to take me to New York, this weekend, flying first class.
I'd look a lot happier than that if someone wanted to take me to New York.
no, it's just, you know, I'm a bit surprised.
314, please.
I've just been to New York. You'll love it.
I'm also waiting for a dress to be delivered.
Oh, we'll have it sent up to your room as soon as it arrives.
great, thank you.
hello.
is about to cross the river full of crocodiles with sharp teeth.
obviously you realize it's up to us to stop him from being eaten.
you stupid half-wit. Do you have any idea what you've done？
your office, now!
while filming at London's Hotel Babylon, "Tom Charles has been treating himself to Botox injections."
it seems Tom isn't as worried about his lines in the script "as the lines in his forehead." Oh, maybe you think this is funny.
no. - But I was guaranteed privacy.
no paps, no leaks.
I'm sure the leaks didn't come from a member of my staff.
so where did they come from？
Tom's out there spitting blood. He wants to quit the hotel.
well, surely that won't be necessary. Um...
I'm certain there's something we can do to make Mr Charles happy.
actors don't do happy. If they're happy, they think they're being screwed.
and those two, they're the worst.
you make one of them happy, the other one's unhappy.
the staff and I will do everything we can to help you.
I have three days left to film.
if I don't get these last few hotel scenes in the can,
I don't have a movie. If I don't have a movie, I'm finished!
I need my actors focused. - I will make your actors happy.
I personally guarantee it.
you have till the end of the day.
if those two are still bitching, we're out of here.
Hmm？
okay, we're gonna need to move these spirit bottles.
Hey, you no touch my spirits.
you touch my spirits, you touch my dick.
okay.
I no touch your spirits.
can I go past？
Hey, you know, when I was a kid growing up in Salamanca,
I always wanted to be an actor. Hey, who's this？
you look at me？ Huh？
you look at me, huh？
don't see anybody else here.
I have absolutely no idea.
robert De Niro, Taxi Driver.
you look at me？
you sound like a Spanish Mr Bean.
okay, uh, before we start... - EMILY: Yeah.
I just want to say
I am really looking forward to working with all of you.
I think we can make Babylon the best and the most profitable five-star hotel in London.
well, I'd like each of you to take on board my own personal mantra, "The customer is king."
what if the customer is some city boy who puke all over my bar？ He no king.
well, yes, you're right. Obviously, there are exceptions...
I will give you an exception.
last night a guest got in the lift and he got his old chap out, and he asked me to...
well, I shall not tell you what he asked me to do with it, - but it wasn't very regal. - But, as a general rule, let's treat all of our guests as royalty, okay？
moving on. Now, some of you may have seen this already.
it popped up on one of those celebrity gossip websites this morning.
now, the producer thinks the leak came from a member of staff.
he's threatening to quit the hotel.
well, I wouldn't be sorry to see them go.
no. Did you see what they did to my restaurant yesterday？
they completely trashed the place.
look, I know they can be disruptive, okay？
but I promised we'd do everything we could for them.
so let's try and make the best of it, okay？
um, this leak could have come from anywhere.
I don't know why they think it was a member of staff.
it could have been one of the crew. - Look, I'm not accusing anyone.
I just want to emphasise respecting guests' confidentiality.
it's so important for the hotel's reputation, especially in attracting celebrities. They demand privacy.
despite what they may say, I think you'll find that they demand publicity.
well, not in this case. We can't afford any leaks.
look, I don't want to get heavy or anything, but if a member of staff is leaking information about guests to the media,
I'll... Well, I'll have to sack them.
right, well, um... Thanks for your cooperation, um...
I know you're all busy with the film crew and everything, so...
so that's it. Thanks.
Thanks.
is it just me, or is that like being back at school？
come on, first-day nerves. Give the lad a chance to settle in.
uh, how's Charlie getting on？ - How would I know？
well, I know you two are close. I thought you might have heard from him.
as if I've got nothing better to do than think about Charlie.
are you lost？
uh, yeah, I'm looking for Anna. She's the head receptionist.
pretty girl, dark hair？ - Yeah.
I just saw her going into the spa. - Oh, great. Thanks.
Crickey! You're not painting the front of a yacht, sweetheart.
if you insist on fluffing, fluff gently.
you know, I'd really like to get him something to make up for this Botox thing.
what does he like？ - Dark-skinned hookers.
anything else？ - Cricket.
he's a huge cricket fan. I'll sort something out for him.
I told the producers I'd handle it personally, so leave it to me.
I have more experience in handling VIPs. I know what I'm doing.
well, I kind of know what I'm doing, too.
on the house.
Thanks.
Humphrey Bogart, Casablanca.
Ah! - Yeah, I know the classics.
of all the gin...
your messages. - Thanks.
I just want to say, I think this film is going to be fantastic.
Thanks.
come in.
your dress arrived. - Mmm.
Thanks. - Oh, it's gorgeous.
I just hope I've got the arse for it. We'll soon find out.
I just wanted to say thank you for earlier.
no worries. What was that about？
is that the guy who wants to take you to New York？
Yes, that's Ned, yeah.
a guy offers to take you to New York and you hide from him？
a little bit weird. - Yeah.
don't you want to go？ - Oh, no. No, it's not that...
we've only been seeing each other for a few weeks, and, you know, it's all so much. New York, first class.
sorry, you're a guest. I shouldn't be boring you with my personal life.
Hey, you've made me your accomplice. Now, come on, give me the details.
Oh, it's complicated.
is there someone else? That kind of complicated.
just tell me to mind my own business if you don't want to talk about it.
Yeah, there was someone else.
he used to work here, and we had a thing, and I...
I thought... Well, I don't know what I thought.
what happened？ - He left.
and he's off jetting around the world, and...
Oh, and Ned's lovely.
it's just every time I think of Charlie, I'm just not sure.
I was the same when I was getting together with my boyfriend, Sam.
messed him about for ages. Nearly drove him insane.
soon as I decided to go for everything, it just clicked. It was amazing.
is that him there？ - Yeah.
at least if it doesn't work out, you would have had New York.
Yes, yes, and I have always wanted to fly first class.
well, there you go. It's worth it just for that.
Oh, you've got so much gorgeous stuff.
Oh! Marc Jacobs. Oh, I love Marc Jacobs.
Oh, wow.
Oh, anyway, I should get back to reception.
thank you so much for listening. - Anytime.
okay.
um...
they're for the second test at Lord's. Luckily, they had some returns.
the best seats in the house. - You're kidding.
well, I... I do appreciate it.
this is fantastic. - It was no problem.
and if there's anything else I can do to make you happy, you only have to ask.
actually, there is something, Jack. Level with me.
that bitch, Katie, she's got the best suite in the hotel, hasn't she？
between the two of you, you have the two best suites in the hotel.
there can't be two bests. One of them must be the best.
I bloody knew it!
she's got the best suite.
bitch.
my contract says that I should have the best suite when I'm on location.
I can assure you, you have got one of the best suites in...
one of the best? I want the best.
now, you make it happen, Jack, or else I'll be very unhappy.
of course.
madam.
what is this？ - The baby carrot and ginger soup.
it's orange.
well, yes, madam, that'll probably be the carrots.
Oh, my God. I cannot eat orange vegetables.
they have to be green.
but madam ordered the carrot soup.
are you trying to sabotage my diet？
do you have any idea how hard it is to stay looking like this？ No.
cause you're too busy running around after Tom to care about me.
Oh, sorry.
Oi, move!
Mmm.
Oh, dear God.
your messages, sir!
thank you.
you cannot handle the truth!
here's Johnny.
you're trying to get a part in the film, aren't you？
what do you know about acting？
I know that I can act. I know that you can't.
we'll just see who gets a part, then.
Oi, Chico, out of the chair!
call me. - Right. See you soon, rachel.
Katie: Not that one! The red one! TANYA: This one？
Katie: No, the other red. The red. Red？
I'm sorry for barging in. Can I help at all？
I can't find my red lipstick.
I need my red lipstick.
I am sure we can find it for you.
no one understands! No one understands how hard it is.
the filming, the travelling, the endless premieres, and interviews, it's so hard!
what did she say？
she was sympathising. She said it must be very tough.
Oh, she understands. Thank you.
Yes, uh, thank you, Tanya. I'll take it from here.
my fans understand. The producers, they don't appreciate my talent.
Really? In that scene, in Love Stinks, where you...
where you seduce your best friend's husband...
Wow.
and you did it all with your eyes.
that's what I'm talking about.
we gotta shoot this sex scene. Simon says I have to be topless.
he says it's all about the tit shot.
I am more than just a spectacular pair of tits.
of course you are. You are a stunning actress.
well, everyone's running around after Tom 'cause of this Botox thing, it's like I'm invisible.
why don't I just go crazy and shave my head？
nobody would even notice.
they even insisted Tom have the best suite.
personally, I don't get it. I mean, you are obviously the star.
Tom has the best suite？ - Yeah.
see？ No respect.
how about
I tell Tom that there's a problem with the plumbing in his suite？
we move him out, and we move you in.
you'd do that？
for you, anything.
Oh, this is definitely the best suite. - This is definitely the suite.
can I get some exercise equipment in here？
big plasma screen.
and in LA, they have silk bed linen. - A load of black-and-white movies.
and some orchids. White, not yellow.
and a Wii.
and a retro Space Invaders arcade machine.
do you know what would be really fantastic？
a water feature.
last time I stayed here, one of your people arranged for this lovely girl to come and visit.
and she had the most divine brown skin.
I'll see what I can do.
you think you can bribe the director with your little tray of snick-snacks？
right. We settle this now.
like men.
show me the money! Show me the money!
Adrian! - Show me the money!
Adrian... - Show me the money!
rocky Balboa. - Cuba Gooding Jr.
if I give you both parts in the film, do you promise to leave me alone？
Oh, we no trouble you no more.
man behind bar.
philosophical wedding planner.
learn your lines.
Ben: Hollywood!
woman: Okay. MAN: Yeah, yeah.
all right there, Jack？
you seem to be doing a lot of running around.
need any help？ - No, uh, everything's fine.
thanks for coming to look at the plumbing.
it's just this way.
Thanks.
so now he's arranging hookers for guests？ I thought that was your job.
Yeah, so it used to be.
I like both of them. How do I choose？
I always thought I wanted a huge and spectacular wedding.
and now I think I'd like romantic and simple.
Oh, I'm so confused.
that's when you know you're in love. I knew it.
so, the style of the wedding she's going to have is some big metaphor for which man she should choose.
please. Who writes this crap？
look at her. She is already cheating on her boyfriend
she's such a fraud.
that's when you know you're in love. - Oh, that was lovely.
was it good？ - Yeah.
a horse, he walk into a bar. And the barman say, "Why the long face？
a horse, he have a long face. - Long face, yeah.
it's funny.
this is a bloody great hotel.
Oh.
I guess that means we're staying. I don't know what you did, but, uh...
thank you.
Simon: Okay, gents. Drink time.
I'm buying, boys.
how is your first day as general manager going？
fine. No problem. Piece of cake.
glad to hear it.
good night. - TONY: Good night, Jack.
so, uh, the good news is, the movie will continue filming in the hotel.
Gino, your acting career is safe.
until they see your acting, anyway.
Oh, I think somebody is a little bit jealous.
the director say I have a gift. - No, the director said you had a lisp.
there is just one other thing I want to talk to you about.
I'm not pointing any fingers or anything, but no one should be drinking alcohol whilst they're on duty.
tell that to the guys in the kitchen.
but it's not just the guys in the kitchen.
now, alcohol abuse is a huge problem within the hospitality industry.
a drink at the end of the shift is hardly alcohol abuse.
look, I'm not suggesting anyone's an alcoholic.
I mean, at least I hope they're not.
look, anyway, if it is the end of your shift, then surely you can wait a few more minutes.
so no more boozing on the job, okay？
- Oh, excuse me.
Hello？ Yes.
Simon: Come in!
how can I help？
we were wondering, when you go to watch one of Katie's films, what do you expect to see？
I expect to see some great acting, and a great story.
thank you.
you don't expect to see her tits？ - I'm sorry？
I guess that's why you advised Katie not to go topless in this sex scene we're about to film.
tell Simon what you said to me, about how I can do it all with my eyes.
I, um... Well, I didn't mean...
I mean, I was talking generally that...
I'm sorry. A 16-year-old boy is not interested in your eyes.
he doesn't care if you've got cataracts. They're not looking at your eyes!
front and centre, my friend. Front and centre!
is that all I am to you, is just a pair of tits？
it's not like I haven't seen them before.
I could pick them out in a line-up.
you're not asking Tom to get his dick out.
Oh, no! He's an actor!
Whoa! Tits and dicks aren't the same thing.
the tits stay in the picture!
I will not do the scene topless. I am an artist.
listen to me, honey. You are an artist with a great pair of tits.
the cinema-going public wanna see your tits.
the financiers want to see your tits. I want to see your tits!
and he wants to see your tits!
tell her! - He respects me.
he respects your tits. You've seen her tits, haven't you？
he's not interested in my tits. - Of course he is!
look at him. He's a tit man!
he's an eye man.
tit man! Tell her! - Tell him eyes.
tits. - Eyes.
tits!
I hate you!
she misinterpreted what I was saying. - Oh.
she was upset, and I was trying to reassure her.
Hey, it's all right. - Oh.
you just torpedoed a $20 million movie.
we'll sue you.
get me our lawyers on the phone.
everything all right？
Yeah. Fine. It's all good.
Thanks.
Oh, this is him handling it personally.
I think you might need to get involved in this one.
Emily: Hmm.
What？
Hiya, Katie. It must be so hard for you as an actress of integrity in this sexist, male-dominated industry.
bloody men.
come on in.
Hi. Mineral water, please. Thanks.
Hi! We met yesterday. - Oh, hi.
can I just say, I think it's great that you're taking Anna to New York.
she's fantastic. - Yeah, yeah, I think so, too.
I told her to go for it. "Just stop worrying," I said.
and besides, very cute.
Oh, here she is.
well, you two have a good time in New York.
he's lovely.
Hey. - Hi.
um, were you talking to that girl about us？
Yeah, I was just telling her about our trip to New York.
Yeah, she said that you should stop worrying, that, um...
thank you. That you should go for it.
what did she mean？
don't you want to go？ - No, of course I do.
well, what was she talking about？
I was just a bit confused.
about us？ - No, no, no, it's not like it sounds.
I shouldn't have got the tickets. No, I knew it was over the top.
no, it's... It's really lovely.
it's just everything's moving quite quickly.
Yeah, and it's my fault. I shouldn't have been so pushy.
I should go. - No, I'm sorry.
no, no, look, if you're confused, then you need some space to sort it out.
it's not like that.
it's better if I go. - Ned...
I'm sorry.
erm, call me. When you're ready.
you know, this really isn't down to me.
I didn't say she shouldn't do the scene topless.
tell it to the judge, my friend.
can we talk about the sex scene？
not with him here.
I'd like her to stay.
do you mind？
okay.
Ouch!
I think we have a solution.
okay, people. We need to be ready to shoot this scene in 30 minutes.
let's go.
ROB: Okay, you heard the man. Let's go, people.
imagine you're making a movie.
Oh, it's all sorted. They're not going to sue you.
right, so she's agreed to do it？
I can't actually say. I signed a confidentiality agreement.
but you have nothing to worry about.
don't you think you should have consulted me before getting involved？
I'm sorry, I should consult you before sorting out the mess that you created？
I was dealing with it. - Oh, okay.
well, great job. Next time, I'll leave you to it.
in this job, you need a drink every now and then.
you do a double shift on reception, you need a large drink!
and several chasers.
I mean, you're telling me Jack has never had a drink on duty？
you know, we should spike the bugger. Get him completely pissed.
Yeah, then when he's unconscious, shave off his eyebrows and all his pubic hair!
Oh! - Maybe just the eyebrows.
come on, he's still finding his feet. Give him a chance. He'll calm down.
all right, if he doesn't, we go for the old spike and shave, all right？
you told Ned I'm confused. What the hell do you think you're doing？
I was telling him that it's okay.
Oh, well done. Nice work. Because now he's just walked off.
see, maybe if you weren't so pissed all the time, you'd realise what it is that you're doing.
sorry？ - And all that bullshit
Yeah, I saw that sleazy old man leaving your room.
so if you're going to be a slut, at least be a slut with standards.
what, do you think this is funny？ - The old man you saw leaving my room,
I'm not shagging him, he's my doctor.
well, you don't look ill to me. - I'm dying.
what do you mean, you're dying？ - I've got pancreatic cancer.
I've got six months to live.
but can't they do something with lasers or something？
this is it. This is why I'm here.
one final blowout before I start going downhill.
it's my last chance to wear dresses like this.
so where's your boyfriend？ Why isn't he here？
he's not exactly my boyfriend any more. I left when I realised I was ill.
I don't want him looking after me when I'm throwing up all the time.
he doesn't know, does he？
I wanted to give him the chance to find someone who's not gonna lose their hair.
you should tell him.
what, "Hey, Sam, guess what, I'm dying"？ No, thanks.
well, he'd want to know. - I can't. It's not fair.
no, of course it's not fair.
but he'll be even more upset if he finds out he couldn't be there for you.
you should give him the chance to decide.
I don't want him looking after me just 'cause he feels guilty.
you don't know how he's going to feel.
I'm so sorry that you're ill, but that's crap.
I wouldn't know what to say to him. I can't. I'm sorry.
Hi, I'm calling from Hotel Babylon, and you've been selected as the winner from our prize draw.
this means you've won one night free in our top suite.
just call this number to collect your prize.
Jack. Jack. Psst!
who's the girl in the bar？ The blonde.
Ah, I'm not sure. I don't think she's a guest.
right. Well, she's lovely.
see if you can get her to come up to my room.
off you pop.
good man.
cheese!
no photos! What's wrong with you people？
cheese!
I have a reservation.
snow White.
right. So which one's Grumpy？
when there are several celebrities staying at the same time, the room service orders alone can get ridiculous.
fruit salad for Snow White, grilled tuna for Miss Flintstone and a cheese and pickle sandwich for Donald Duck.
Tony: Some of the measures they take to avoid being spotted are often just a ruse for generating more publicity.
celebrities ask to be sneaked out the back door, but only after they've tipped off the paparazzi.
let's get this party started.
# Mama, just killed a man # Put a gun against his head # Pulled the trigger, now he's dead # Mama, life has just begun # And now I've gone and thrown it all away # Mama
all: # Ooh # Didn't mean to make you cry # If I'm not back again this time tomorrow # Carry on, carry on # As if nothing really matters - Hi. - Hi.
# I see a little silhouetto of a man # Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango？
# Thunderbolt and lightning Very, very frightening me # I'm just a poor boy Nobody loves me # He's just a poor boy from a poor family # Spare him his life from this monstrosity # Easy come, easy go Will you let me go？
# Bismillah, no! # We will not let him go # Let him go! # Bismillah # We will not let him go # Let him go!
# Bismillah # We will not let him go # Let me go! # Will not let him go!
# Let me go! # Will not let him go!
# Let me go! # No!
# No, no, no, no, no, no!
# Mamma mia, mamma mia # Mamma mia #
I make it for the film wrap party. It's called "The Hollywood."
Oh, catchy name.
Oh, yeah. That's good. - Hope there's no alcohol in that.
I'm testing it for Gino. It's called "The Hollywood."
Yeah, I'm not sure there's a difference between testing it and drinking it.
you're not gonna make a big deal about me having one sip of a cocktail, are you？
Tony, I did say I didn't want anyone drinking while they're on duty.
and, oh, yes, that looks like a drink to me.
Jack, I know you've only been in the job two days, and I don't know what it is they taught you on that management course, but this really isn't the way to do it.
Yeah, but I'm doing it for everyone's benefit.
Gino, can you pour it away, please？
I've been telling everyone to cut you some slack.
I've defended you.
now I'm giving you a chance to back down.
you really don't want to piss me off.
you know, I really, really don't need you to defend me.
Gino, pour it away.
fine. You're on your own.
you're crocodile meat.
that boy have a big cork up his ass, eh？
hello. - TOM: Jack, I need you.
what the hell happened？ - Nothing.
she fell over. We were dancing and...
okay, she's breathing. Have you called an ambulance？
no. No, no, no.
think of the publicity. I can't be involved with this.
you'll have to deal with this. - What？
I'm supposed to be on set. - I'm sorry, you're leaving？
you brought her up here. This is down to you.
you might need these.
Hey, she took them off.
it happens.
I owe you one.
it will take more than a bit of make-up to turn him into an actor.
they should have screen-tested me. Look.
what am I looking at？ - I've got film-star cheekbones.
Hi, I'm Sam Quinn. I'm here to receive my prize.
Prize？ Sorry, sir？ - Tony, it's okay. I'll deal with this.
right, if you'd just like to, um, step this way, we're going to do the presentation in one of the rooms upstairs.
tell me something. Who are the suits？ - Oh, they're the film's financiers.
I get the feeling they're not happy about something.
no way!
excuse me. Oh, it's the boy wonder. - Oh!
Jack, hi, how can I help you？ - Tony, I need your help.
uh, well, my hands are a little tied at the moment.
that's serious. No, sorry, I don't think I can get away.
Emily？ No, I haven't seen her.
sorry, Jack, you're gonna have to speak...
bad... ine... You're breaking up...
I'm... losing you.
do you think he's in trouble？
frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
excuse me.
where the hell have you been？ The financiers are going crazy!
Simon, I'm sorry. I was learning my lines.
been topping up the Botox？ - MAN: Quiet on set, please.
don't you ever tire of being such a complete bitch？
are you two finished yet？
man: 646, take 1.
stand by.
you know, I'm really loving the mascara on you.
Yeah, it really defines your eyes.
Hey.
break your legs.
and action.
Hi. - Aloha.
Oh, God, is he really gonna do it like that？
Simon: Cut!
so, this is the, uh, third floor.
it's also known as the fuchsia floor.
and, uh, here's your surprise.
I thought you two needed to talk.
what is this？
did you put her up to this？ - No.
so why am I here？ - I don't know. I didn't want to see you.
just gonna let him go？ - I told you. I didn't want him to know.
Anna, no!
Sam! - Just stay away from me.
Sam, wait!
Sam, wait!
no, no, wait.
you have to talk to her. - Sam!
leave me alone. You're insane.
she's dying.
Hi, how are you？
what happened？
well, I was just passing and I heard a crash and found you like this.
think you had a bit too much to drink.
no, that actor was here. Tom Charles.
were you touching me？ - No. No!
did he leave me like this？
he's famous. I could go to the papers.
no, I don't think you want to do that.
I'm sure we can work something out.
yeah？ Like what？
because this all looks pretty bad to me.
Yeah.
she left because she doesn't want you to go through it.
she doesn't want you to see her like this.
she was trying to protect you.
I'm sorry, but we've got a huge problem.
another one？
where is everybody？ - We've been shut down.
the financiers saw Tom and Katie in action.
they said it was one of the worst on-screen chemistries they've ever seen.
they pulled the plug. - They can't actually do that, can they？
of course they can. It's their money. They can do whatever they like.
I'm afraid it means we won't be able to pay our bill.
no. - I'm sorry.
but it's huge.
I mean, it's massive. It's over... It's over ￡300, 000.
I guess you could sue us.
but the production company is effectively bankrupt, so you'd be wasting your time.
what am I going to tell the hotel's owners？
I've only been in this job for two days!
I did everything I could!
the chemistry wasn't there.
the least you could let me do is buy you a drink.
Yeah, could I, um...
I'm on duty!
keep 'em coming, Chico. - Yes, sir.
I'm sorry.
you should have told me.
it's okay. It's okay.
I want to be there for you.
it's okay.
Hello? - Hi, Ned.
Anna. - Can you meet me after work？
uh, sure. - Thanks.
I didn't ask to be general manager.
they've invested so much money in me.
all the training and the qualifications, when they asked if I wanted it...
I couldn't say no.
I know everyone thinks I'm too young. That I'm this overqualified idiot.
I just wanted to prove them wrong.
two days.
two days, and I have screwed it all up!
no one can run this place on their own.
don't try and do everything yourself.
you need to let us do our jobs.
we're actually pretty good at them.
I behaved like a total arsehole.
are you asking me for help？
Yeah.
okay.
just as long as we're clear about the arsehole thing.
Yeah.
Cyrano de Bergerac, that's a bit ambitious.
maybe. But if we can create some genuine chemistry between these two actors, we may save the film.
you work on her. We'll work on him.
well, that is, of course, unless Jack would rather handle it personally.
no, and, uh, thanks for coming back in. I, uh... I really appreciate it.
no problem.
okay, first things first. Now, this girl who knocked herself out, - is she a blonde？ - Yeah. How did you know？
Tony: Hello, Lily. - Oh, crap.
Lily hangs around in five-star hotels waiting for rich, famous men to pick her up.
then she gets up to their room, causes a scene, and then threatens to go to the tabloids unless they pay her off.
it's something like that, isn't it, Lily？
girl's gotta make a living.
come on, put that down. Get your tights on, we're going.
thank you, Lily. No doubt we'll be seeing you again.
little bit of advice.
when you're putting a girl's knickers on, try getting them the right way around.
don't ask.
the film getting shut down, it's all Tom's fault.
the ego on the guy.
water.
it's weird. I was in his suite earlier, and he was watching one of your films, and he kept going on and on about how insanely talented you were.
Really？ He said I was talented？
Mmm-hmm.
he has every single one of your films.
and photographs of you.
see for yourself if you want.
maybe it would be better if you did this.
Tony: Your confidence has taken a knock.
you fall off the horse, you get straight back on.
just remember, I'll be on the other end of this if you need me.
off you go.
I mean, the film shutting down. It's all her bloody fault.
you know, the only talent she's got is right there.
and they're not even hers.
Tony ON EARPIECE: There's your in. Go for it.
well, uh, it must have been hard for her, acting opposite you.
What？ - I mean...
she was probably intimidated by your vast talent.
she was probably intimidated by your vast talent.
Yeah, true.
I heard her talking about you.
I heard her talking about you. - Hmm.
and, uh, well, she was saying that...
man ON RADIO: There's a guy climbing the fire escape.
there's a guy climbing the fire escape.
What？ - Mustafa, get off this channel!
mustafa, get off this channel! - What？ Who the hell's Mustafa？
he's the guy that Katie was talking to when she...
that's... That's the guy that Katie was talking to when I heard her say that you are the most talented comic actor of your generation.
Really？ - Oh, yeah.
what else did she say？ Hold on, let me buy you a drink.
Oh, um, I can't. I'm on duty.
SOD that. I'm buying you a drink. And I need to hear this.
do you really want to screw this up for the sake of one drink?
Thanks. I'll, uh... I'll have a whisky.
Tom: Right, Gino. Mmm, two large whiskies.
hmm.
don't worry. Your secret will be safe with us.
I'll leave you the bottle.
good man. Cheers.
so, tell me more.
I mean, she is completely obsessed with you.
you know, she's like, "Tom this, Tom that. He's so brilliant"!
yet so modest.
well, he's a natural once he's got a few drinks inside him.
he better be. Otherwise he ruin my acting career.
are you wearing make-up？
living the life of an actor, my friend.
Oh, my God!
I should have seen it before.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I should have seen it earlier. Of course. Huh!
she's obviously totally... - He's obviously...
...in love with me. ...totally in love with me.
why on earth shall I help him after the way he spoke to me？
because there was a time when you didn't know what you were doing, either.
not to mention he's doing your pay review next month.
good point. Jack？ - Yes？
is he drunk？ - Ever so slightly.
look.
we sit Tom and Katie facing each other.
one here, one at table six.
if we keep the tables in the middle clear, they will have a direct line of sight.
it will almost be like they're dining together.
I will have Chef devise a special menu.
the dishes will contain every aphrodisiac known to man.
this will be sex on a plate.
Ah!
Christ.
Mmm.
Ooh!
Ooh!
I'll have what she's having.
it's working.
just one more thing to do.
when they see how much publicity they're gonna get as a couple, my guess is that they won't be able to stop themselves running with it.
a list of my press contacts.
you're saying we leak a story about them？
no, no, no. I told everyone strictly no leaks to the media.
well, you can stick by that if you want to.
the film company won't be able to pay their bill, and you'll lose your job.
or you could step up to the plate and show everyone you've got what it takes to be the general manager.
my advice is that you throw out the rulebook.
do whatever you've got to do to get the job done.
it's your call.
look at that, mate.
hotel Babylon's made all the front pages.
hold on, I'll just be a minute.
you off？
Sam's taking me home.
this is for you. - No, I can't.
for everything.
okay.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm sorry.
I just want to know where I stand.
do you want to...
Yeah.
it's... It's just everything was happening so fast.
and, well, I just needed some time to get my head around it all.
well, and now that I have...
well, I really want to be with you.
are you sure？ I'm not trying to rush you.
no, no, no. Completely, and...
I'd love to go to New York with you, if you still want to go with me.
more than ever.
come on.
all the bitching, the fighting, the arguing...
when I said that I hated you, well, what I really meant to say was, "I love you."
prove it.
Simon: Cut!
tremendous. - MAN: Thank you very much.
how long do you think they'll last？
I think they'll be married, adopted a couple of Malawian babies, and divorced within three months.
Oh, somebody looks happy.
well, the financiers are loving it. We're back in business.
I'll go and prepare your bill.
Tony, um... - Yes？
Thanks.
it's okay.
so, tell me, how did you get Katie to do the sex scene？
I thought she was refusing to go topless.
Ah, we used a breast double.
this double-breast woman, maybe I can meet her.
I'm afraid her identity is strictly confidential.
show me my mark, because I am ready to do some acting.
actually, guys, we've had a rethink. We don't need you any more.
we've merged both your parts to create a new role.
it's 007. Licence to grill.
Tony: Running a hotel is a bit like making a movie.
it isn't an exact science.
there's no one set of rules to follow.
we have to learn which rules to bend and which ones to break.
reporter: Where are you off to next？
just like the film director, the most important thing a new general manager needs to do is get their staff on side.
that way, they might just survive.
Cheers.
all: Cheers.
a full-on brawl in the lobby. It's classy.
Eddie, I'm not getting you another girl.
you're the resident pimp, aren't you？
you're sacked. - You've got to get out of here.
please.
you think you're pretty clever, don't you？
no, I think I'm pretty and clever.
you want to make an enemy of Gino？
you can't hurt me. - We'll see about that.
Dan Black levitated in the lift earlier.
I do not want to know about your sordid little encounters.
James: Now you're jealous of my relationship with Chloe.
have I ever lied to you, James？
it's notes on how he's going to disappear today.
steal it, now!
Hello, baby. This is Sam Franklin.
I was married to him.
Anna, let me help. - What?!
I was after the manager. - You're looking at her.
where is the sweepstake? I want to make bet.
I found your little sweepstake.
you can get off me now.
don't you get that you just being here is confusing the hell out of me?
last night I made some calls to Tokyo and I'm pleased to inform you I'm now the proud owner of Hotel Babylon.
a week ago I was in charge of a range of global businesses, 'living the dream.
now I'm waiting to find out what's left of it.
the one asset I know I still own is Hotel Babylon.
but what do I know about hotels, I hear you ask. Well...
I've stayed in plenty, and with a CV like mine, 'running a hotel should be a walk in the park.
I've been handling people all my life.
I know how to make them happy.'
when the owner guaranteed you tickets, he failed to appreciate the popularity of the show.
or the lateness of the hour.
what is it? A slug.
it's also a classic con.
you eat 95% of your meal, then you put a grub on the plate and complain.
Sam fell for it.
he gave them vouchers for a free dinner.
morning. Did you get the tickets? Great.
thank you, thank you. Morning, morning.
no-one could say that 'Sam Franklin ever let them down.'
Sam. - I've got to take a shower.
I'll be right back down.
as owner, your job's simple
make sure everyone feels valued and appreciated.'
Sam, I need you to sign off some ideas I've had on improving the profile of the hospitality areas.
now's not a good time...Michael.
I tidy your room special, so now it is...
Yes, just give me a sec, Tanya.
Yep.
clean.
give it to me straight.
what have I got left?
hotel Babylon is definitely all I have?
I'll call you later.
and if life throws you a curve ball, 'your job is to pick yourself up, smile and get on with it.'
you roll with the punches and you fight back.
I running late because I was getting ready.
for what? Your coming-out ball?
this my first meeting as head of housekeeping.
I make effort.
head of housekeeping? - Mr Sam promote me.
Wow! Queen of the cleaners. Hi.
well, you'll be pleased to know you missed my "happy to be general manager" speech, but the key points were that I welcome chocolate gifts - and I love a good party. - Me too!
Oh, we're SO going to get on.
on the off-chance that you may tire of another ten-minute monologue from me,
I'd like to open it to the floor.
so, what have we got this weekend?
as I'm sure you're all aware, we have Ed and Erin Martyn staying with us.
Oh, great - How could we forget, when that's all you talk about?
well, I would suggest that the lifestyle gurus and TV celebrities are our premier guests.
chef and I have already looked over their own recipe books and come up with some additional ideas for their joint birthday dinner.
their stuff's wholesome, family food.
you doing wild-bean casserole and brown bread-and-butter pudding?
James run this event like a military exercise.
Gino, I want a bit of this.
Gino, I want a bit of that.
Gino, I want a bit of the other.
and everything in the restaurant has to close at 5: 05 because Mr Slick Pants here, he wants to watch The Ed And Erin Show.
what good have they ever done anyone, eh?
they've changed the way that civilians live their lives, that's all!
absolutely - bringing back old-fashioned values, - home cooking and family meals. - I think they're evil.
what?
they appear as the perfect family and make everyone else feel inadequate.
we've also got the European heavyweight challenger staying
now you talking about somebody who change lives, eh?
I thought he just rearranged faces.
Yeah, he going to rearrange your British challenger's face, that's for sure. Spain going to smash Great Britain, eh?
boxing in gloves is for women.
real men fight with bare fists and teeth!
I think that two men thumping each other for entertainment is just repulsive.
well, you don't need to worry about that.
there's not going to be much thumping.
just a quick bang, bang from Gomez, and your boy Morrison, on his back.
last time out, Morrison destroyed Helmut Schneider, and Gomez has yet to face a southpaw.
what? You think I shouldn't know about boxing because I'm a woman?
Yes.
morning.
sorry, this is a staff meeting.
Yeah.
and you're here because...? - Looking good, Tanya.
my first contribution is an initiative from City Hall.
leading up to the 2012 Olympics, they're seeing how eco-friendly hospitality businesses are, checking their carbon footprints, etc.
well, we already have pretty good green credentials.
well, I for one always recycle my make-up containers.
another small country saved
it's called the Green Pillow Scheme and I've arranged for someone from their office to do an on-site inspection today.
today?!
Well...as Emily says, we've already got great credentials.
he or she will just turn up, tick the relevant boxes, award us top marks.
anyone fancy taking it on? - Me, me!
it's all media hype, whipping up hysteria.
I think it's a key issue, actually.
passion. That's what I like to hear. Thank you, Emily.
inspector will turn up sometime this morning.
OK, that's it.
people don't come to a five-star hotel to wonder whether we're recycling their shampoo bottles or using eco-friendly mouthwash.
do I take it you're not a jolly green giant, then, James?
not a jolly green anything at the moment.
it's a bandwagon.
I need to book four rooms for a friend of mine this weekend.
superior rooms.
we're fully booked. - Just do the Rubik's shuffle.
twist, move and rearrange.
bring two guests up from the third to the sixth floor, two from the sixth to the fourth.
that frees up rooms on the fifth and third floor.
so move one person from the first up to the sixth floor, one from the sixth to the third floor.
that frees up rooms on the fourth, fifth and third floor.
fill them with people from the seventh and you've got four superior rooms available.
what she said. - ??
the guest's name's Foreman, Carlton Foreman.
put it back, Tyler.
Oh! Is it coming?!
no. THEY are.
mr and Mrs Martyn, I'm Juliet Miller, the general manager.
hello - How do you do?
welcome to Hotel Babylon. We're delighted to have you.
we're delighted to be here. Aren't we? - Mm-hm.
well, if you'd like to take a seat, we'll bring you over a complimentary drink while we check you in.
I'd love to see where the party's gonna be.
you want to stay here and get a drink?
I want to stay with you.
Aw! 12 years of marriage and she still can't get enough of me.
Oh, stop.
we have your payment details, so here are your key cards, Mr and Mrs Martyn.
Annie, do you want to take Tyler up to the room?
can I just say I'm a massive fan?
the item you did last week about the mind-blowing holiday disasters...
it was mind-blowing.
The...herd of cows, cliff-top caravan...
Yeah. So when are you due? - Oh, um...about a month.
ed loved it when I was pregnant.
well, there's nothing more amazing than a pregnant woman.
Yeah, you should try it from this side.
Oh, if he could've had Tyler himself, he would have.
all the scans, the check-ups, the prenatal classes -I couldn't get enough.
I hope your fella's pulling his weight.
Yeah...er...he is.
mr and Mrs Martyn, shall we...? - Great.
Bye. - Bye.
feel like I've just met royalty.
I'm going to be sick. - What?
go over this list and be ready to answer any questions the inspector may have.
it's like being back at school. How would you know?
come on. Who's the Anna-baby-father frontrunner?
no frontrunners, but about 700... - Cover it.
maybe I should just ask for the weekend off.
what's up?
she's had her first brush with the country's most famous family.
they made you feel rubbish?
well, they noticed the bump, asked her about the dad, and then she threw up.
welcome to parenthood. Most of the time you feel ill-equipped, inadequate, and the rest of the time you feel nauseous.
talking of parenthood, none of you saw Anna's baby scan pictures.
can we see?
look, you can see its little fingers. Oh!
OK, now, looks like it's got James's nose, but that's impossible.
what about the chin? The head shape reminds me of...
you remember the guy with the dark hair? - Who?
he works with whatshisname. - Who?
I thought that you'd stopped taking bets.
well, we did.
we had. - But we start again.
I thought you were genuinely interested in the baby, but you're not, you just want to win some stupid bet.
from now on, just don't even look at me.
Anna, it's just a bit of fun. - No. It's not.
Oh, come on, Anna, just give us some clues.
is the father tall? - Is he dark haired?
is he black? - Is he someone we know?
put us out of our misery.
OK, fine.
you really want to know who the father is? - Yes.
you really, really want me - Yes!
you want me to come out and say who the father is?
Yes! Yes!
OK, fine! It's him! All right?!
which means I win the money!
so I take it darkness and alcohol played their part in your coupling with Darren the waiter.
Why?
is he not good-looking? - He's OK, but ordinary looks coupled with no money measures somewhere between the Elephant Man and Quasimodo on your scale.
Hey, you.
you have rooms. Yes? - Booked or not, you've got them.
Fernando.
hombre!
come on! - What you doing? Hey!
I your biggest fan! I just want to shake your hand!
mr Gomez. I'm Juliet Miller, the general manager.
welcome to Hotel Babylon.
I'm so sorry about the fan, and I guarantee he won't pester you again, but he is actually our bar manager, so we may need him.
Rafael!
Gabriel!
OK? - Mm-hm.
Fernando! I still your biggest fan, eh?
Hello, reception. Anna Thornton-Wilton speaking.
another one's gone.' - Who is this?
she's gone.'
so have you had an pairs walk out on you before?
loads of times.
I know looking after someone else's kid is a thankless job, but it's hardly rocket science, is it?
what do you want for breakfast, lunch?
want to go to the park? Here's your dinner. Get to bed!
it's easy. - You're funny.
funny ha-ha or funny weird?
weird, definitely.
OK. Let's get you back to your mummy and daddy now.
I'm 11, not two. - Yeah, whatever.
no. Let me phone our office and check out the hopsack-weave linen we featured in our last book.
I think it's going to give the room a much more homely feel.
you're the expert on homely. Yeah.
the chef thought the risotto ai funghi would be a more appropriate accompaniment to the lighter antipasti choices.
it all sounds good, James. I know nothing about wine.
never touch the stuff.
so I'm leaving the choices to your Spanish sommelier.
our who?
Oh, our barman.
I've called him many things, but a sommelier? No, no, no.
Hey, small fry. What's been happening?
your nanny's walked out on you.
what? - Yeah. Tyler rang down to reception and I saw her walking out of the door.
Oh, no! What are we going to do?
er, well, we'll just have to keep Tyler with us for the weekend.
what? While we pull a TV programme together?
while we talk to scriptwriters and producers?
he'll be bored, Ed. Jesus, I'm bored talking to them, and I'm an adult!
darling, we'll sort something. - So what are we gonna do?
we've got all our friends coming to a party!
darling, relax. - We'll just have to cancel.
we won't have to cancel. - Maybe we could help.
how?
well, I could ask a member of staff to look after Tyler, give you time to sort something else out long term.
so do you have, like, a child-minding thing here?
no, but...
how about Anna?
me? - Yes. You've forged a relationship with Tyler?
no. No, not really. - And you could do with the practice.
Yeah.
and it would be much less taxing for you than standing up for eight-hour shifts.
I can lean.
Oh, God. - Tyler? Tyler, what do you think?
Yeah, Tyler. Do you want a bossy, weird woman looking after you?
why not?
great. That's sorted, then. - Thanks.
now, this risotto. I don't like risotto.
I think we should have fish.
tough life, being an owner. - I'm sorry, did I miss the memo about the Neanderthal look-alike competition here today?
that's no ordinary Neanderthal.
that's Don "Pitbull" Morrison and his entourage.
call security. I want this reprobate out of here now!
Oh, shut up! This man is POSING as a hotel manager.
he couldn't run a bloody bath, bloody charlatan.
you don't call. You don't text. - Why the hell would I call you?
good to see you, Sammy. Listen, thanks for sorting out the rooms.
Oh, what are mates for?
anyway, so last I heard, you were in...Arizona, mining uranium?
arkansas, digging for copper.
didn't find any, so I fell into the boxing game.
boxing? - Yeah.
this is my latest charge,
don Morrison, European heavyweight champion.
what are you looking at?
just you...you're not so big close up.
are you Spanish?
I hate the Spanish.
why don't you just shake hands and play nice?
Ow! I didn't know the Spanish were so strong.
call off the fight, Carlton...not.
I'll go get him checked in. - Mmm.
can I have a word, please, sir? - Mmm.
sir, we've got a big problem, and you need to sort something out before Juliet...
um... Is that who I think it is?
who booked him in? - What's the problem?
you arrived late to the morning meeting, so you have no idea that we also have Fernando Gomez booked in this weekend.
fernando who? - You don't follow sport, then?
not really. - Oh.
fernando Gomez is Morrison's opponent in the big fight this weekend.
we've got both boxers staying here? Fantastic!
Sam, you're not getting it.
they can't both be here. Morrison has to go.
Jules? Jules, hello!
Carlton, what are you doing here?
it was Carlton who phoned me for the rooms. He's Morrison's manager.
if you're staying here, we should all get together for a meal, talk about old times.
I work here, actually. - What?
you work...with Sam?
no... Oh, no!
what's so funny?
no offence, but the best thing you two ever did was get away from each other.
now you're working together?
Yeah, and it's going pretty well.
good.
well, I just hope I'm not around when it all goes tits up...again.
funny you should mention you not being around...
why don't you get yourself checked into the room and we'll have a catch-up drink later?
Carlton and Morrison cannot stay here. - Why not?
because at this stage with a fight, boxers are programmed to kill their opponent on sight.
if either finds out the other's here, they'll murder each other.
he has to go.
I can't throw him out.
I owe him. - What? Money?
when we split up, I was in a mess.
he was there for me.
so he broke out the whisky and tissues and now you're honour-bound to help him out?
why do you dislike him so much?
it might be to do with his mentioning every one of your past conquests in his best man speech, or the fact that your golf weekends away lasted till Tuesday.
I can't throw him out.
I thought we agreed that I was going to run this hotel.
OK.
cards on the table.
I spoke to Michael this morning. Hotel Babylon's all I have left.
everything else has gone. - Everything?
which means I'm staying put.
but together, we can make a real go of this place, make some serious money.
what do you say?
this is not what we agreed to, Sam.
the answer I'm looking for is "yes."
and the answer you're getting is "maybe."
I can work with "maybe."
you're being issued with timetables for both the boxing camps.
any deviations from the itineraries by either party and you need to contact me, Sam or Tony, ASAP.
you all know the score. These two groups must never meet.
understand? Never.
Tony! - Let me wish you luck, eh?
beat this Pitbull man, eh?
Hey, hey. Kill him if you have to!
do it for Spain.
it's OK. Go.
mr Gomez? - Mr Morrison?
there's a message from the venue.
time to go.
well, thank you, gentlemen. Have a good day.
right, do something. - Ah, Mr Morrison.
if I could break with protocol for one minute and, um...
ask you to sign this napkin for me?
I didn't take you for a fight fan. - I love a good scrap, me.
if you could write, "To James, love from..."
or just "from" would be fine.
you don't have a bicycle stand?
this is a five-star hotel. - So?
so couriers go round the back.
there's nowhere to put my bike?
don't tempt me, mate. - I'll just have to take it in, then.
at the risk of stating the bleedin' obvious - on yer bike.
I am Robert Carrick, environmental officer from City Hall.
I believe I'm expected.
Congratulations. You've just failed test number one.
mr Carrick, welcome to Hotel Babylon.
I'm Emily James, head of PR. We are delighted to have you with us today.
I did ask for somewhere to store my bicycle.
Oh, that's easy. Tony, bike. Of course.
I imagine you're a man who likes to hit the ground running, so I've set up the most energy-efficient route around the hotel, taking in all the key areas - bedrooms...
I thought I'd take him to the Trocadero Centre, and then get him a burger or something for lunch.
no. No, no, no. He can't leave the hotel without us.
we also advocate a strictly organic diet. No processed foods.
I think he's lactose intolerant.
ed thinks that I'm too fussy but...
"Fussy" wasn't the word I used, sweetness.
so I recommend a limited amount of dairy-based foodstuffs, chocolate being an absolute no-no until after 4: 00, where he's allowed two squares max.
and we all know that fizzy drinks are the quickest way to tooth decay.
and crisps are poison!
now, before I forget, I need you to sign this.
it's just a straightforward confidentiality agreement.
Oh! I don't know.
no, it's routine. All our staff sign one.
it might conflict with the contract I have with the hotel.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
just when I thought it was going to work.
darling, what... - I'm sorry. I...
I couldn't think of putting him in the hands of a stranger.
I could do it without the agreement. - It's impossible.
just call that manager woman and tell her to cancel the party.
darling...
darling, please stop it. We'll sort something out.
OK! I'll sign.
Thanks. - It's all yours.
how much do pirates pay for their earrings?
a buck an ear!
Ta-da!
OK, come on, hit me as hard as you like, eh?
Gino feel nothing, eh?
I wasn't ready.
come here.
what am I supposed to do?
Oh, educate yourself.
Yeah, that's what he said. Why am I always the last to hear?
I'll talk to Chef. - Thanks.
sorry.
hello. I'm Anna.
I know. Darren.
was James OK?
I just saw him talking to you. - Oh, yeah.
he's in a bad mood about the boxers.
they want protein drinks, raw eggs and raw liver.
he never likes it when people mess with the food.
right. OK. Listen, you might find some of the staff have been a little bit weird with you today.
that's because of me.
um, it's...it's a funny story, but they were pestering me to tell them who the father of my baby is, and I...
I told them it's you, which is just ridiculous, I know, because as if I would...
with you! That would... Urgh, no!
anyway, if anyone asks, just say that you are the dad, OK?
cool, cool.
Um...quick, now, tell a joke.
I don't know any.
Oh, you! Oooh! Oooh, you're strong.
all right...Ohhh.
go. Now go.
Oooh, bye! Love you!
what do we have in here?
er, Anna, sorry about the sweepstake thing.
Yeah, yeah, it was. - Yeah.
but you're OK?
Yeah, I'm OK.
Yes. Yes, yes.
I do, too, sometimes.
so obviously he's the one.
Yeah. Yeah. I thought he was.
well, Darren's a nice guy.
Yes, Darren.
Yes. Oooh, he's lovely. Ohhh!
lovely Darren. - Yeah.
did she say anything? And is he the dad?
well, she didn't say that he's not.
the refrigeration system could do with an overhaul to lower emissions.
I've already booked an engineer to have a look at all the machinery.
have you?
Yes, well, the ventilation's inadequate, the insulation is patchy and the lighting is uneconomical.
you see, we take green issues very seriously at Hotel Babylon and I am determined to make improvements as and when I feel they're necessary.
shall we?
hmm. Looks like somebody's after your job.
hmm?
Oh!
have you seen a small boy with big hair? I think I saw him...
what the bloody hell do you think you're doing?!
Oh, God! - Playing PSP.
and you shouldn't swear.
I was worried sick.
you weren't when you dumped me in the lobby.
do you think it's funny, running off like that?
I didn't run. I walked.
Oh!
what would your parents say if they knew I lost you?
so it's my parents you're worried about, not me?
Yes, of course. They're famous.
you're rubbish with kids, eh? - And you're rubbish with adults.
that's because adults ARE rubbish.
Yeah, well, everyone is. Get used to it - I had to.
I suppose you'll want this back.
I'm not gonna agree, Erin!
I'm his mother! - I'm his bloody dad! So what?
what's going on? - They're arguing about their divorce.
I can look after him as well as you!
what? Like you did when I was in Barcelona?
you are such a cow!
are they always like this? - Most times.
and you just have to listen?
I didn't want to still be debating this - at our bloody party, Ed! - Then agree to 50/50 custody and we can go and give all our friends the full happy Martyns experience!
70/30- that's my final offer. Just agree to it.
what? So you can squeeze me out? - You are so paranoid!
and you're a scheming cow! - Should I...?
it wasn't me who had the first affair, sweetheart!
and it wasn't me who had the slutting last!
Hello! Um...
just thought I'd let you know that we're back, and, um...
I'm just going to go, so you guys just...
and I'll, um, see you tomorrow.
um...just a second.
this might be a good moment to remind you that you have actually signed a confidentiality agreement.
she knows that! - Yeah?
I know that.
Mm-hm?
why are you such a cow?! - Because I've been married to you - for 12 years! - God, I hate you!
would you like me to take you somewhere else?
it's OK. I'm used to it.
I'm sorry for being horrible to you today.
you were just being yourself, right? - Yeah.
no taste! The state of you!
the bloody state of you!
you vile...pink bitch!
you slimy... Oh!
as you can see, there are notices in every bathroom telling guests to re-use their towels.
and we all know that's less about saving the planet and more about saving your laundry bills.
the cleaning products you have are chock-full of petrochemicals and phosphates and are so crammed with unbiodegradable oils and lards...
so what do I do?
I would suggest a very large bonfire.
it's the Morrison party back from the Ivy.
and where's Gomez? - Safely sat up in his room.
it's a code green.
Oh, no!
it's OK. It's OK.
what the hell are you doing here?
I stay here. What are you doing here?
I'm here to put your lights out, Mr Gomez!
and I'm here to castrate the Pitbull, Cabron.
do something. - What?
OK, gentlemen, let's keep a lid on it, nice and friendly.
you know, save it for the ring, eh?
Hey!
you're dead... - Wait, stop!
out of the way. - Shut up!
someone get a doctor!
you should've punched! - Yes.
we need to contain this, keep it out of the press.
OK, I'll go and find Emily.
what happens if it's broken?
then the fight gets cancelled, people lose a shitload of money, and I hate to say this, but this hotel is up the proverbial creek without a paddle.
come on, Carlton! - "Come on" what, Sam?
seriously, you booked both boxers into the same hotel!
if this didn't hurt so much, I'd deal with you myself.
I didn't know Gomez was staying here till after you'd arrived.
and you couldn't tell us then?
you'd have felt you had to leave. - You're a moron!
I'd rather have been given the choice and have left because, frankly, with the purse, the sponsorship, the television, the advertising revenue alone, we stand to lose several million pounds, all of which I've got to try and recoup.
so I'm gonna have to sue this hotel.
look, I know I messed up, but... this could ruin me.
Sam, seriously... mate, this is business, yeah?
pure and simple.
anyway, first things first
I need to get Don's hand X-rayed. - I'll arrange it.
Oh, hey, hey, big lady!
"big lady"?
dear me. I've awakened the beast inside.
no, you are not a big lady.
you are a tiny little rose with a little baby inside.
Oh, it doesn't matter. I'm just in a bad mood.
here. What's this?
this is the Mexican AA.
the Mexican AA?
no alcohol, but spicy flavour.
OK.
Oh! You lost your cherry.
here.
so what happened?
Oh. The scars of war.
lucky for Tony that Gino was there to help him out, eh?
come on, tell Gino.
you have a baby on the way.
why are you not blooming like a big, ripe tomato?
it just...it just hit me that I'm having a baby.
I knew that I was having a baby, but I just realised that I'm, like, actually having a baby.
like, I'm going to have a baby.
I don't have anything ready.
I don't have a nursery, I haven't got any nappies.
I went out to buy a cot the other day and I came back with new shoes.
how are new shoes - even gorgeous ones...
they're velvet and have diamante heels.
how are they going to help my baby?
and what sort of a well-dressed mother does that make me?
look, nobody is good with kids until they actually have kids.
I have a son, you know?
Yeah, I know - little Gino. - Oh, no, no, this is another one, in Barcelona. He's 12. Cristiano.
do they not have sex education in Spain?
Oh, yes.
I was a young waiter in a hotel.
29, charming, handsome, virile. A ladies' man, you know?
no, I can't picture that.
well, Martha pictured it.
she was the waitress and we did the naked mambo underneath a bloody red moon.
God!
but I get the wanderlust again, I move off to pastures new.
I didn't know about him until four years ago, when my sister got absolutely bladdered at a party and blurt it out.
what did you do when you found out?
what could I do, eh?
she has robbed me of the chance of being his father.
is that how you feel, that you were robbed?
every child needs his father.
and every father needs his child.
a man has a right to know the truth, eh?
but...but you're OK.
you have your father. You have Darren.
he be very good for...bringing sandwiches.
a waiter.
very useful.
as you can see, we already have an extensive recycling system in place, - so shall we move on? - Wait!
this was in with the brown glass.
looks like I'm going to have to dig a lot deeper.
Ooh!
I hope you've got rubber gloves.
so...what's she like, eh? - Who?
I bet she's like a dark-haired Venus, eh?
Yeah. - Like a tigress, eh?
Yeah, it was electric. - No hanky-panky, eh?
OK? - Right.
OK. Go.
Sam, I need to speak to you urgently about the Green Pillow man.
what's he still doing here?
well, as the day's gone on, he's got harder and harder to please.
what do you want me to do about it? - Well, talk to him.
I mean, it will help... the restaurant.
Oh, joy
red snapper. Where's that from?
the Gulf of Mexico, I believe.
there's also some great British produce, right, James?
the odd cheese, I suppose.
australian barramundi. New Zealand lamb.
Oh, I see you're offering mangosteen from Thailand.
it's an extensive menu of fine dining.
an extensive global menu that's clocking up the air miles and CO2 emissions.
I think you'll find we're no more profligate than any other Michelin-starred restaurant, Mr Carrick.
which is no excuse for complacency.
Oh, I can see I'm gonna be here for some considerable time.
I suppose I should find somewhere nearby to stay overnight.
why don't we organise a room for you here?
I don't think so!
we're eager to facilitate this process in any way we can.
well...
have the room for as long as you like.
Emily, if you'd like to get Mr Carrick checked in.
superior room. - Yes. This way, please, Mr Carrick.
checking up on me?
no, I...I just came to apologise.
it was a crappy thing I did and I'm sorry.
it's all right.
I quite enjoyed people thinking I was the dad. It felt good.
well, I'm going to tell everyone you're not and let you off the hook.
you don't have to.
I mean, I've been playing along. It's cool.
Really?
OK, darling.
too much, right?
way too much - Yeah.
want some more, eh?
want some more of Gino the Bull?
in the red corner, the Bull!
round two. Pow! Pow!
look at the Bull go. Look at him go. He's gonna kill him.
he'll kill him. Bah! Bah! Dah! Gino!
so, I heard about the brawl in reception.
somebody said that you were... What was it?
slapping like a girl. - What?
look, I'll have you know, when I was a young man, I was a boxer, eh?
punched in the head repeatedly as a youth.
explains a lot.
Emily, what room is that inspector in?
Oh...301. Why?
thought so.
room service. Lobster?
Green-lipped mussels? - Mozambique lobster,
norwegian mussels and a very fine French champagne.
you look closely, the cracks always start to show.
I am gonna have him monitored overnight.
but everyone's got secrets. - Good night.
I can't tell you. - But you tell me everything.
hang on.
what's that?
well, they made me sign a confidentiality agreement, so if I do one with you, then I can tell you anything, right?
bring it on.
OK.
now spill the beans.
the Martyns...are getting a divorce.
No! - Yeah.
No!
can I help you, madam?
I'm sure you could. Unfortunately, I'm here to meet a friend.
if you ask at the front desk, they'll help you find him.
Thanks.
what's the world record for owning and then losing a hotel?
whatever it is, I'm sure you're in the running.
given the chance, I could've made a pretty good fist of this place.
come on, Sam, you've been down before.
Yeah, but I've usually had some assets tucked away somewhere before.
but this time...
you've always loved a challenge.
Carlton says that's why I married you.
and Carlton's a real expert on relationships, isn't he?
you've really got it in for him, haven't you?
he made a pass at me when we were married.
when?
you were in Scandinavia trying to get that bottled water business off the ground and he called round and took me out.
I think he thought as he'd forked out for dinner that I owed him something.
and on that happy note...
I'm gonna get some sleep. - You don't fancy another?
no. I'll see you tomorrow.
I thought we were gonna have a moratorium on this subject for the duration of the party.
you'd like that, wouldn't you? Sweep it under the carpet.
we're never gonna agree about custody, are we?
well, not until you stop trying to screw me over, no!
please, don't use the word "screw" in relation to you and I.
it makes me feel unwell.
you're trying to reduce the amount of time I get to spend with Tyler, which I will not stand for, you poisonous...
Hi. Matt! Jody! Glad you could make it.
Hi! Oh, lipstick, sorry. - Catch up with you in a bit.
I will never back down over this.
that's why I made a decision last night. - About what?
I've had an offer from the US to set up a media branch of our business there.
phoned my lawyers first thing this morning, told them it was a goer.
Hi. Glad you could make it.
great to see you.
Tyler and I will be splitting our time between here and the States.
been planning this all along, haven't you? You selfish, conniving bitch!
Oh, I'm so glad you could come! - Hi, Jacob!
what a surprise. I didn't think you'd make it. Great to see you.
one, two, three, four, and four more.
the hand is definitely fractured? - Afraid so.
so I'm gonna have to instruct my lawyers to start legal proceedings against the hotel.
don't do this. - I don't have a choice.
Carlton, we've been friends for years.
listen, Sam, there is no way I can absorb these costs myself, OK?
and the bottom line is you messed up.
all right, look, the only possible alternative I can think of is if we come to some agreement.
settle out of court?
did you have a figure in mind?
it's gotta be a figure I'm happy with.
of course it has.
Hey, Jules, I'm reaching out here.
you're all heart - I'm the wronged bloody party!
tell me something I DON'T know.
OK, can I make a suggestion?
can I suggest you piss off and let Sam and I deal with this ourselves?
did you just tell Juliet to piss off?
Yes, I did. Sound advice.
why don't I make a suggestion?
if you're gonna sue me, then let's do it through the proper channels.
Sam, you are making a HUGE mistake.
no, I made a huge mistake thinking you were someone I could trust.
so it's only fair that I keep you all in the loop.
we may well be taken to court over this, and if we are, it could turn nasty.
I don't remember seeing Morrison throw a punch.
what? - Well, I'm trying to work out when he actually hurt his hand, and I don't remember seeing him throw a right.
look, he must have done.
he's soft, anyway.
I shook his hand when he first arrive, and he cry like a baby.
Gino is, er, stronger than he know.
show me how you shook it.
like this.
Oh!
Yeah, OK, that's like a limp lettuce.
Hey! How could that have hurt him?
he had it cocked, but he never actually threw it.
what, you're an expert on boxing, all of a sudden?
I had an ex-boyfriend who was a boxer.
you went out with a boxer?
I didn't go into a nunnery after our divorce.
what was he? Middleweight? Light welter?
does it matter?
no. Not to me. No.
do you think that Morrison hurt his hand before he got here?
there's a good chance, yeah.
Carlton, just the man we wanted to see.
notified your lawyers yet?
we thought we'd give you a chance to explain yourself first.
explain myself?
is this your pathetic attempt to try and wheedle out of being sued?
no, it's our way of saying we know what you did.
when did you injure your hand, Don?
it wasn't last night, was it?
seriously, you are wasting your time.
something to hide, Carlton?
you knew Gomez was staying here before you came, didn't you?
what did Carlton tell you?
what did he offer you to carry out the con?
all right, look, I want you out of my room now.
it's not your room, it's mine.
not for much longer, mate, if things go my way.
I understand why a devious slug like Carlton would do this, but you don't strike me as a dishonest person.
I'm not.
you're a champion, a great sportsman. You believe in fair play!
Oh, please!
think about this very carefully.
remember what's at stake.
Carlton's priorities lie solely with himself.
when did you injure your hand?
honestly.
a month ago.
I'll call Jake Samuels, see where we stand media-wise.
Juliet, it's started.
I've already been fielding calls from the press about a brawl in a hotel.
then organise a press conference for Don Morrison to appease the journos for the time being.
OK. - Emily!
sorry. Did you have a chance to tell Sam about our eco-warrior's room service order?
Yes. - Has anything else happened?
well, he had told me that he wanted to do a random inspection today.
which is odd, because Tanya says he hasn't taken the "do not disturb" sign off his door.
fine. We should disturb him.
mr Carrick?
he's used every towel in the hotel.
the air conditioning's on full blast. Windows are open.
you are so clever, squeezing a whole night out of them!
Oh!
you had me running round like a blue-arsed fly, - and for what? - I really am sorry, but you should see some of the dumps I usually have to inspect.
so what are you going to rate us?
I think I can guarantee you a four-point rating.
no-one gets five!
Thanks.
now, I'm not going to bore you with a long speech.
I'm going to bore you with a short one instead.
thank you.
thank you, thank you all for coming and sharing this bleakest of moments where Ed and I topple headlong into our 40s.
talking of whom, thanks, Ed, for 12 glorious years of marriage.
and to our terrific son, Tyler.
Aw! - I love you both very, very much.
now, as you all know, Ed's a bit of a nerd
a poetry nerd.
so I asked him to write us a bit of a poem for our birthday, and in a moment of utter madness he agreed.
so before he becomes too incapable, over to you, darling!
darling. - Yes, darling.
thank you, darling.
the end of love should be a big event.
it should involve the hiring of a hall.
why the hell not? It happens to us all.
why should it pass without acknowledgement?
suits should be dry-cleaned, invitations sent.
whatever form it takes - a tiff, a brawl
the end of love should be a big event.
it should involve the hiring of a hall...
from visible to hidden, from door to wall.
thank you.
as you've probably gathered, that's not one of mine.
it's by Sophie Hannah. A little more appropriate, though.
let's give him a great big round of applause. He likes those.
I told him to come back inside, but he wouldn't.
ed, what on earth are you doing?
stay there. - You're missing the party.
good. I hate parties.
Where's Erin? - She's downstairs still.
pouring oil on troubled waters?
that's my girl.
why don't you go back downstairs... - Stay there!
save the full-blown breakdown for tomorrow morning.
she's toying with me.
I don't stand a chance of getting custody, because between her and her hot-shot lawyers, she'll freeze me out.
so how is being drunk and abusive gonna help your cause?
ed, be careful! This is the seventh floor, for God's sake!
what, between the devil and the deep blue sea?
Aargh! - Ed!
I'm just testing you. - How many of those have you got?
what's wrong with him?
he's just a little bit tired and emotional, that's all. Right, Ed?
tired is right.
sick and bloody tired.
Ed! - Mum!
Tyler! - Oh, right on cue!
he's a selfish sod. I'm gonna kill him.
you stay in there, you!
what the hell are you doing?
and what was all that about downstairs?
have you any idea how hard it's been convincing people nothing's wrong?
then don't.
we agreed how we were gonna work this.
but it's all bullshit!
well, this is it, Ed. Yeah? The end.
please! Don't do this! - Yes, the bitter bloody end.
you're a selfish bastard. - So you're calling ME selfish?
Yes, I bloody am.
right, stop! Just stop it now!
all I've heard from both of you is how bad YOU'RE feeling and what YOU want.
but there is another person caught in the middle of this and if you'd stop for one second to think what HE wants or how HE'S feeling...
because I've been with Tyler less than 12 hours, and I can see that this is making him miserable.
it is making you all really miserable.
he doesn't understand what's going on.
Oh, no, yes, he does, because he's had to listen to you every day for months!
he understands better than you two idiots.
so just talk to him.
find out what HE wants before it's too late.
I know the first thing he wants is for you to get off that bloody wall. Get down!
right, now, get in!
now, sit down.
Now...talk.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
welcome, everyone.
I think we all agree that it's been an incredibly frustrating and disappointing 24 hours for boxing fans and for Mr Morrison in particular.
he has a prepared statement that he'd like to read out.
I apologise...to Fernando and his team, to my team, and most of all, to the fans.
I'm a fighter.
all I want to do is fight.
and I let myself be misled by a bad manager and...
I'm really sorry.
thank you very much.
which means we aren't going to America, so I can see Dad when I like.
well, that's good.
if they're not happy, they should split up, right?
Yeah. I think so.
here, you should have this
for when it gets too much in reception.
thank you very much.
is it a boy or a girl?
do you know, I have no idea.
whatever it is, it's lucky.
why do you say that?
because it'll have a good mum.
do you think so?
if it all goes wrong with the dad, promise you won't stay together just for the kid.
OK, I promise.
you sure you're only 11?
right, so how do we kill zombies?
Yeah, so maybe we're missing a trick here.
I mean, after we release the news of the divorce, we could rebrand, become The Ed Martyn And Erin King Show, aimed at the newly separated parent.
looking at how you nurture as single parents, seeing both points of view.
that's good. - I'll phone Pete, set up a meeting.
great. Actually, it's very, very good.
I think you may need this a little bit longer.
I do hope you enjoyed your stay, Mr Carrick.
it's been such a pleasure.
um, aren't you forgetting something, Mr Carrick?
it takes dedication, application and above all, 'admitting your mistakes.'
I thought you were keen to gain that certificate.
what's it gonna do except attract a lot more picky people in organic socks and edible shoes?
Oh, hear, hear!
OK, everyone, let's get back to work.
sorry.
I really think this could work, don't you?
you need to get to meetings on time, run new ideas past me first, be open and straight about any planned changes and let me run my team.
does that mean you're gonna stay? - For the time being.
thank you.
there's a long way to go, Sam. Don't thank me yet.
when all's said and done, we need to learn to ask for help if we need it.'
I just wanted to say if you need anyone to be around for you and the baby...
I just wanted to say if you need anyone to be around for you and the baby...
someone to get things, go to the shops, buy nappies and stuff.
what, like a servant?
I suppose.
Yeah. Mmm.
thank you.
er, thank you...
for making me the dad.
tea, milk, no sugar.
yeah?
what you think? He the daddy?
I think I'd put you higher up my hit list, and that's saying something.
Oh. - You all right?
Yes. It's kicking.
here.
So...are you ready to come clean yet?
what?
I mean, we all know that Darren's not the dad.
and as I am the most trustworthy and reliable person here, and because you're dying to tell somebody...
why don't you tell me?
because it's all very well being strong and self-reliant, 'but some secrets are impossible to keep.'
OK. - OK.
who is Harold Kelly?
Harold stole 12 cut emeralds which he claims he hid somewhere in the hotel.
it's a hoax. You really think there's buried treasure here?
I don't like the look of you.
you remind me of Errol Flynn. Bastard!
you sure you'll be OK? - Got ages to go...Oh!
my waters just broke! - Two men have been killed in the hotel.
I've come home to die. - But there's so much to live for.
where are you? You ain't half picked a day for it.
just need a bit of time just to get my head round all of this.
when you invite a group of gamblers into your hotel
for a poker tournament,
it's bound to have an effect on the staff.
and there's always a chance that things can get out of hand.
what cards do you have? - She's been cheating.
but life is full of risk.
getting to a meeting on time...
Hmm!
or eating in the staff canteen...
two breakfasts, please.
can be full of hidden dangers.
and even the simplest human transaction
carries the possibility of misunderstanding.
Oh, thanks. - Thank you very much.
I've got something for you, big shot.
here's your 200.
next time we meet on the green baize, I taking you down, my friend.
most of us have learnt to manage risk...
well, this place is totally weird.
there's some really big names here
good players from the gambling circuit.
but life can deal you an 'unexpected card.'
what? - One of the biggest hoteliers in Europe.
well, make sure it clears. A hundred million.
Damien Rushby's my father.
Seriously?
well, that makes you hotel royalty.
actually, it makes me feel pretty sick.
sorry, I need to get some air.
it's exhilarating out there today. - Yeah.
almost as cool as when we had
the Swedish striptease team come for the sex Olympics.
did we? - No. But a man can dream.
here she is, the girl that brought us the biggest game in town.
Hey, hey. - Why are you so excited today?
well, gamblers are my kind of people.
we're not afraid to put our balls on the line.
thanks for the visuals, Sam, but try to control yourself today.
control myself?
I know you like to gamble, but sometimes you get carried away???
don't worry. Emily and I are hosting. I'll just be an expert onlooker.
OK. Where's Tony?
I saw him in the corridor. - No, you didn't.
he just phoned me to say he's had an incident in the lift and he's gonna be late.
Emily, what do we need to know?
sorry? What? - About the tournament.
Oh! Um...yes.
the Texas hold 'em is a popular poker variant,
and the hold 'em 50 sees 50 players each paying ten grand a seat.
it's a survival of the fittest knockout,
so the last man standing walks away with half a million pounds.
you know a lot about it.
you get more than a basic education at a girls' private school.
Emily and Sam are the tournament directors,
so they'll be busy all day, as the poker is our main event.
I'd like to remind everybody
that the restaurant will be closed after lunch for the reading.
what? This bloke Bobby Mack?
Yes. He's one of my favourite neorealists, actually.
you know, his latest opus is a staggering...
story of authenticity and genius."Yeah."
I tried to read it. A bit too stodgy for me.
is there anything else??? - There is one last thing.
Arianna Adams is booked in to stay today.
the shipping heiress. Sorry I'm late, one of those mornings.
you do realise that Arianna Adams is not going to show?
she's a phantom guest.
she always books the hanging garden suite every summer.
always pays, never comes.
well, her people e-Mailed me last night, detailing her demands - She never comes. - She is definitely coming.
so, Sam, I need you to vacate the hanging garden suite.
of course. Straight away.
and everybody else, I need you to be fully prepared.
I'll bet you 50 she never comes.
you may want to hang on to your money today, Gino.
so, what did I miss?
Oh, there's some big beasts here for the poker, Tony.
there's bound to be a few rabbits as well.
maybe we could skin a few, eh?
gambling's bad for your health.
speaking of which, the 200 you owe me?
very funny, pretty boy.
it's great to be in London, isn't it?
I know I'm not gonna have a chance to see any of the sights while we're here,
so I'm gonna spend the day channelling what it would be like
to eat cucumber sandwiches on a double-Decker bus, next to freaky dudes in bowler hats.
you're pale. Have you eaten?
I'll get you some breakfast. Keep those blood sugars up.
it's not bad here. The maitred's got the funniest accent.
I nearly lost it when I heard him say, "black pudding and grilled tomatoes."
I'll go find the concierge.
OK, thank you. - Emily.
here's ten grand. I wanna play. Sneak me in.
Sam, I don't think I'm gonna be able to host this tournament today.
what? - It's personal.
I, um...I can't do it with my father here.
Emily, this is your baby.
you know all the details. I can't do this without you.
Er...no. I asked for 39mm clay.
these are too heavy.
I want 8. 5 to 10 gram. - No problem.
look, I'm gonna have to go. He's on his way. I'm really sorry.
what's going on?
we haven't seen each other in over a year.
he's arrogant and he's difficult
and we haven't had much of a relationship since my mum died.
your mum died? - Five years ago.
sorry, I didn't know.
we never really dealt with it,
and then he went and got rid of all her stuff without asking me.
so having him here...
is your chance to put things right.
it's not the time or the place.
shit. - I'll take this.
Hello, darling. - Hi.
sorry I missed your birthday. - And Christmas.
using your mum's name, not mine?
well, it's just for work, it's nothing personal.
isn't it? - You're such a big figure on the hotel scene,
anything I achieve I want to do it on my own merit.
quite right. - So you're here for the tournament?
Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you, and when I heard the game was here,
it seemed like the perfect opportunity.
Yes. - I thought we could have a chat.
well, I'm very busy.
but I hope you have a wonderful stay at Hotel Babylon.
well, that's what I like to see, a friendly face at reception.
always sets the right tone.
mr Rushby, this is such a thrill.
your hotels are fabulous.
an inspiration. - Oh, thank you.
would you ask Mr Franklin to come up and see me, please?
OK. - Thank you.
excuse me. Excuse me.
I'd like the full English breakfast.
Oh, really, Tony?
and I'd like a pastrami on rye with the pickle on the side!
very funny. Who's Tony?
I haven't got time for this. - Oh.
have a nice day.
Um...do you like this? - Oh, it's gorgeous.
and very expensive. - That's the whole point.
the Italian in 207 gave it to me. - Oh.
but it's not really my style. I was wondering whether you'd like it.
no, I couldn't. - Oh, honestly. It's not a problem.
I want you to have it. Please.
Hey. - Hey.
your dad is lovely. He's so stylish.
where would you like these ghastly chicken wings?
just pop them there.
now, the e-Mail from Arianna's people specifically requested - That we get in some old tiger... - saffron gin.
and some white winter truffles to shave over her hot-Buttered linguine?
Oh, have you got them?
course we have.
you've laid on quite a welcome.
here's to a long and healthy relationship.
that's a very impressive watch.
this? It went up with Apollo 11.
Really? - Yep. It's priceless.
how did you come by it?
I won it in a card game.
are you a player? - Not today.
Oh, shame.
I heard about you buying this place.
very audacious.
it's a tight-Knit community in the hotel game.
most of us grew up on the shop floor together.
but you went straight in at the top.
I was fortunate to be in a position to do so.
these are tough times.
oil spike, dollar slump, credit crunch.
people are finding it hard to keep afloat.
now, I've got 12 hotels in my portfolio
I can absorb these fluctuations.
but what about you? - I manage.
word on the street says you're making a decent fist of things,
but you have liquidity issues and you're not a natural for the hotel game.
I'm sure you don't mean to be rude, but that's how it's coming across.
I want to help you.
I can offer you a way out.
I'll take Babylon off your hands.
I'll give you what you paid for it, plus 10% on top.
not bad in a recession.
Babylon's not for sale.
you'd better be sure of that.
things are only gonna get worse from here.
and I'm not coming back with a better offer.
you may have been in the hotel game since time began...
but you've got no style.
this is just business.
it's not the way I do business.
Dry-Cleaning!
Oh, my... god!
in German mythology, meeting your double is a very bad omen.
well, that's one more reason why I'm glad I'm not german, then!
Yeah. Come in, come in.
Oh, you're the famous author.
I'm glad to see one of us has made something of himself.
it doesn't always feel that way.
I've been signing for the last two hours.
it's been the same every day for the last ten weeks.
Wow! - Yeah.
this book tour's so long, I sometimes lose track of who I am.
Yeah, I know how that feels. Pint with the boys at lunchtime, that's what gets me through the day.
Oh, I miss that old scene.
I used to work in a department store, three years, in New York city.
I used to feel like all human life was there.
now all I see is the inside of a five-Star hotel.
how sad for you.
Yeah, I really have to go, but it was nice to meet you.
maybe I'll see you again at your book signing.
sure. Er, I want you to have this.
thank you very much, sir.
OK.
miss Adams.
I believe you've been expecting me. I'm Arianna Adams.
Hi...Miss Adams!
my people should have sent you an e-Mail with my particular requests.
miss Adams, it's a pleasure to have you staying with us.
we received your e-Mail and everything's ready, so please come this way.
tell Gino he owes me 50 quid.
miss Adams, wait.
Tanya, I need your help.
step away from the lift. - Um...er...
Ben, there are people waiting.
sorry.
I always keep several hotel rooms booked.
I never know which one will take my fancy.
quickly.
wonderful hotel. Lovely staff.
excuse me.
we up the creek without a puddle.
every year I've had her wretched truffles flown in
and every year I've watched them rot slowly and expensively when she didn't show.
me too, with the gin - I had to sell it at discount to the royal
to balance the balance sheet.
OK, OK, what are we gonna do? - Well, I in denial.
I'm going to light a big cigar, listen to some Charles Aznavour
and kiss the roly-poly woman from housekeeping and hope it goes away.
but it's Arianna Adams! - Don't panic.
I'll call in some favours.
come on.
ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to follow me,
the poker tournament is about to begin.
Hmrc. Spot check on your returns.
what?
we're gonna need invoices, matching receipts, payroll records, going back seven years.
you're kidding.
I don't see anyone laughing.
you look troubled, my child. Could I be of any assistance?
Oh, not unless your eminent can use your bible magic and turn water into old tiger saffron gin.
you get some very exotic types in here, don't you?
we got a big poker game here today.
I always wished I'd learned to play.
had my chance when I was young.
well, against the backdrop of eternity, your magnificent,
we all still young.
can you teach me, please? - Oh, no, no, no, no.
holiness, no, no.
I don't wanna get in trouble with your boss in heaven because I've taken all your money.
please. - No, no, no.
no. How much you want to play for?
I just met your father. - Lucky you.
quite a character.
can you help me find table five?
Hi. I'm Emily James.
I'm Crispin Lloyd. But everyone calls me Justice.
I'll show you to your table.
why does everyone call you Justice?
we all have aliases to make us seem interesting.
I used to be a lawyer, human rights.
Oh, not Justice again. I thought I'd cleaned you out last time.
and I thought you'd changed your name to cashpoint, seeing as you're always giving your money away.
today's game too rich for you, Franklin?
the revenue are here, they're doing a spot check.
I'll come up. - What?!
Sam, we were going to do our opening address together.
you'll be fine.
welcome, everyone, to hold 'em 50 at Hotel Babylon.
this is a massive inconvenience.
we're holding a major event today.
can't we do it some other time?
it's a spot check, you don't get to pick your time.
the hotel was audited last year.
your operating systems are slack and your drawdown facilities are shocking.
but I had the place checked before I bought it.
maybe that check wasn't thorough enough.
two pairs. - Oh.
must be beginner's luck.
Yeah. You are surprisingly good at this.
I think the good lord is looking down on me, - Protecting me. - The good lord.
do you want to raise the stakes?
Yeah, OK. - The game's starting, Billy.
pick on someone your own size. - Oh, no, it's OK. I can handle it.
don't mess with billy the beast. - Billy the beast?
you're not a priest? - I was...
till I gambled the church roof funds and found something better to worship.
come on, Billy.
moscow and Bombay are great cities.
so is London, Rome, Berlin, but we never get to see any of them.
we wait at airports, get on planes, check into hotels,
do a reading of the book, do a signing of the book,
wait at an airport, get on a plane, check into a hotel.
it's like groundhog day. - I know.
maybe after, we could go for a drink or something.
er... er... or not.
I'm going to, er...
go.
it's a catastrophe. - I know. I've tried everyone.
nobody has any white truffles or any old tiger saffron gin.
not that. I just been mugged by a man in a white collar.
Ben, can you lend me some money till payday?
Gino, don't let your mind wander.
it's far too small to be let out on its own.
Arianna's booked into the restaurant in an hour.
what? - Oh, god.
have you guys seen this American author?
he's my spitting image.
lemonade, please.
honestly, he and I are exactly the same.
Yeah, except that he's been on the bestseller list for 40 weeks.
Yeah, and he's sitting upstairs in one of our most expensive suites.
while you're wondering if you can afford the daily specials.
apart from that...
Thanks, guys.
you organised all this?
very impressive.
how long have you worked here? - Just over a year.
head of PR. It's a good job.
a lot of responsibility. - Yes, I enjoy it.
I think it's time you stepped up a gear, though.
manage one of the family hotels, perhaps.
you don't want to be a PR girl all your life.
you see, this is one of our major problems.
you disappear for large periods of my life
and you pop back in at your convenience and expect me to listen to your advice.
I'm sorry, I thought we could catch up.
Oh, right, in between card games.
look, I have a really important job supervising this today
and I could really do without your cosy chats and career advice.
Emily, listen. - No, you listen.
just concentrate on your game and leave me alone.
oi. Where's that taxi I ordered?
I'm just on hold now, sir.
you're about as useful as an ejector seat in a helicopter.
this is not a spectator sport, you know.
sorry, it was a cool phrase.
people say the most perceptive things.
Er...404's luggage is stuck at terminal 5
and wants you to chase it up. And this...
is Brutus. He's 19 and incontinent,
so if he's not walked every 40 minutes, things get very messy.
OK. Thank you, Ben.
Oh, Tony, er...after you've taken care of the roman dog,
could you come up and see me? I've got a request of my own.
Yeah.
dog farts bloody hell.
Oh, you know he's doing a reading here today.
Yes, I do know. That's why I'm here.
I'm his biggest fan. I'm crazy for him.
I've bombarded him with countless letters...
Oh, gosh. Well, enjoy your meal.
get a move on! She's here! She's here!
OK, where's the food dye?
has anyone seen my perigords?
Oh, my gosh, this is never gonna work.
what do you need from me?
you get to meet a lot of people during your day,
with their strange requests.
I thought maybe we could swap places for the day. Cheers.
what, I become the famous author and you become...?
Mm-hm, yeah. I'd really love to do your job, just for a few hours.
seriously, you wanna be a concierge?
I need some variety.
I need a change of rhythm.
you would get to take a break up here.
right now that is rather appealing.
Yeah. I mean, afternoon in five-Star luxury.
get to put whatever you want on my bill.
no. Nice try, but no.
you've gotta do your book reading later on. I'm not a public speaker.
Tony, you're a natural. You deal with the public all the time.
come on. How's your American accent?
my British is pretty good.
you were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off.
it's Michael Caine.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
gene wilder! That's brilliant.
Hey, hey, we could do this. - We can?
Yeah. Tony, come on, think about it.
what have we got to lose? What do you say?
watch this.
I soaked these ordinary perigord truffles in oil
and then glazed them with egg to get just the right hue.
old tiger gin gets its colour from being steeped with saffron for years,
but this is the perfect match.
OK, you guys are mad.
Arianna will never tell the difference.
service!
all right, come on.
enjoy your meal, madam.
the moment of truth.
come on, god.
you let your preacher take my money, now you're going to help me.
we did it. We bloody did it.
Yes!
I can't believe I'm doing this.
that is my book of secrets.
it's got every contact number
and every eventuality I've had over the last 20 years.
but if you do have any problems, I'm always on the end of the phone.
and if things get out of control for you,
Paige, my PA, she's a great backstop.
are you and her an item?
Oh, I see. You like her.
what's not to like? She's young, intelligent, hip, slick and beautiful.
if opposites attract, I might stand a chance, though.
I'm afraid when she looks at me, all she sees is a boring old grouch.
speak for yourself.
well, I got guests to attend to.
come here.
thank you. So I'll see you back here for the swap-over at 6. 30.
I must be mad.
OK, Tony, 6: 30.
ladies and gentlemen, 12 players have taken an early bath
and blinds are now going up 50 and 100 after the next hand.
thank you.
chicken wing?
Yeah, I'm only using them as an excuse to talk to you.
I never realised they could be deployed as a chat-up device.
you have to be highly skilled!
do you think you'll win today? - Only if I can shake off Rushby.
everyone's got a tell when they're lying at cards
a small thing that gives them away
and I can usually spot it, except with Damien.
I can't read Damien.
Emily. Sorry. Can you cover for me?
health and safety have turned up. - What?!
like a dog with a bone once they get their teeth in.
buggers to shake loose.
room service, please.
I'd like a steak and chips... oh, french fries.
always a pleasure to see you, Tony.
but I'm in a bit of a rush.
but please do send up the usual.
Oh, the usual? - You know what makes me happy.
Sam Franklin. Can I help you? - Health and safety.
here to do spot checks on your exits, emergencies and extinguishers.
we were checked two weeks ago.
who's your qualified first aider? - Emily James, head of PR.
I want to see her. - Well, you can't.
Sam, I'll deal with this.
I'm going to speak to Rushby.
chip leader at the moment is devil fish.
Damien Rushby is second, Justice third.
this is difficult for me, because family is family and I don't want to intrude.
what? What has he done?
well, as you know, we've had the revenue crawling all over us all day,
and health and safety have turned up with practically the same agenda.
and this morning your father tried to buy the hotel from me.
what?
I was just wondering if these events were related.
I'm not saying he'd... - of course they are.
it's just the kind of stunt he would pull.
he doesn't even pause to think about me.
I know this is tricky for you... - Sam, this is where I work.
this is my life, and he has no respect for that.
we have to get rid of him.
I didn't want to be the one to say it, but, yes, we do.
any ideas?
plenty.
Oh, come in.
room service. - Yeah, just put it right there.
my god, Tony was right. - Who?
no, I'm sorry, you just loOK remarkably like a friend of mine.
is he witty and intelligent?
no, not really.
could you sign this? - Sure.
thank you. Thank you.
Oh, blimey.
excuse me?
you know, Rub-A-Dub-Dub, three men in a pub.
apples and pears, I got big flares.
it's amazing what you pick up on BBC America.
Absolutely.
Oh, this is for you.
thank you, sir. - You're welcome.
I have a feeling some of the problems I've been encountering today
with the authorities might have something to do with you.
no idea what you're talking about.
you're sabotaging my hotel.
I said I don't know what you're talking about.
you know you said you didn't know Damien's tell.
I'll raise your 50, 000.
I'm all in.
that's big money, Damien.
think you've got me beat?
I know I have.
you're bluffing.
I'll call.
the usual, the usual.
er...
I know that you want the usual and that the usual makes you happy,
but I was thinking that we've known each other for so long,
Er...that maybe we could do something unusual for a change.
this is an anthurium. It's my favourite flower.
it's divine.
you know, I was thinking of Iris Murdoch today,
and she said, "people from a planet without flowers" "Must think that we're mad with joy the whole time" "To have such things about us."
I hope it makes you mad with joy.
Oh. Oh.
so much more interesting than the evening paper you usually bring me.
Oh, lovely.
evening paper.
it's just me.
Oh. Whoa.
sorry.
cute boxers.
I, er.
I just came to say you're on in ten.
Oh, OK.
I'm sorry you felt you had to do that.
it's nothing to do with me.
I could hardly miss you whispering to justice.
are you leaving now?
look, I didn't come for us to get into a fight.
you hardly came in peace. You tried to buy the hotel.
do you know why I wanted the hotel?
it was for you.
that is totally crass. Is that your idea of trying...?
I thought it could bring us back together.
just leave.
is everything OK? - This is between me and my...
your necklace.
you can't buy me.
I think you should go.
are you OK?
er, me? Yeah.
sure, I'm fine. - You'll be wonderful.
you've done this a hundred times before.
you see? Two Tonys.
can't be good for the world.
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr Bobby Mack.
pretty spineless of you to send friends to do your dirty work.
no different from you using my daughter to knock me out of the tournament.
you caused me a great deal of inconvenience??
and you and Emily have just cost me a lot of money.
you'd have lost it anyway. - Oh, really?
you're a big game tourist. You shouldn't have been in that hand.
how much have you won at the poker table this year?
not as much as you've lost.
I've won half a million so far, and I don't even need the money.
whereas you're clinging to Babylon
after the shipwreck of your business career.
and you haven't even got the balls to join the big boys to play poker today.
let's play now.
heads up, no limit.
sure you can handle it?
follow me.
as the sky snapped shut like a broken bulb "And the satanic storm gathered to scorn them, his body split, "And she reached deep within him "And wept.
mr Mack will now take a few questions.
who's first? - Ah, yes. Yes.
mr Mack, I've always wanted to know,
when you write "three white mice sit under a juniper tree,"
what exactly is it that you mean by that?
wh-what do I mean?
what is the symbolism in that phrase that you repeat so often in your work?
what is it that you're trying to indicate to us?
um...
that's...
what I mean, when I wrote that,
um...I, um...
what I'm trying to...say...
is that there's three white mice and they're sitting...
under a juniper tree.
er, do you understand?
Yes, I think I do now.
I think I do finally. Thank you so much.
well, that's...
anyone else?
how much are we playing for?
how much have you got?
enough.
Thanks.
thank you so much. - Pleasure to meet you.
thank you so much, Mr. Mack.
that was such an honour.
I've been wanting to meet you for such a long time.
Arianna Adams. Did you receive all my letters?
er...you know, everybody's been so kind,
but I feel the creative muse is upon me.
I'll get your things. - Thank you.
I can feel the flames of inspiration are licking at my heels.
I must go write.
thank you.
pleasure to be of assistance. Let me know if I can help you in the future.
case is closed. - Right.
miss Miller, all done.
what's going on?
Oh, my father sent them in to give us the squeeze
when Sam wouldn't sell Babylon.
he seemed so charming. - Yeah.
well, we don't have to worry about him any more, he's gone.
actually, I saw him playing cards with Sam down in the canteen.
What?!
three jacks. I win.
what is he doing here?
we're playing cards.
I wasn't talking to you.
fantastic, Sam. Now you're playing poker.
just sorting a few things out.
Sam, the whole point was to get him out of the hotel.
relax, both of you.
I'm winning. He's much more fun now.
raise.
look what they did to me.
Oh, my goodness.
what will Bobby Mack have thought?
I've never been so embarrassed in all my life.
I'll call a house doctor.
it was the old tiger saffron gin.
Really? Does it always do that?
no, it never does that.
and I have never had a more bizarre-Tastingwhite winter truffle.
what are you saying exactly?
well, you're the manager
you tell me what's going on.
I'll investigate immediately.
Yes, do that.
but I'm leaving in the morning
and I will never set foot in this hotel again...ever!
I couldn't have won without your help, giving me Damien's tell.
well, I'm just glad it's all over.
I'm extremely grateful.
and, look, I wanted to ask you something.
Oh, you did?
Yeah, I don't know if you're free tomorrow night.
I might be.
there's another tournament. I thought you could come along.
What?!
well, there's this guy there who bluffed a house, beat my flush,
and I thought maybe you could watch him, spot his tell.
Congratulations. - Thank you so much.
you want me to be your spotter?
Yeah, I really need to take him down.
you really need to get a life.
Hey, Paige. - I sharpened your pencils.
Why?
you said you wanted to write.
you like your pencils to be sharp.
Er...well, I could have done that myself.
I like doing it for you.
well, you needn't go to all that trouble.
it's my job.
um...
when was the last time...
you and I had a drink together?
we've, um...
never.
king Lear? It's awesome. I saw it in Chicago.
it really captures the anguish of a fond, foolish old man
trapped between obstinacy and pride.
you're gonna love it. Oh, I'll book those tickets. 504?
tea break.
now? It's getting late.
Yes, if you're six years old and getting ready for bed,
but you're Tony and you never miss a cup of tea.
now, come on. You're buying.
Oh, shit.
right, you lot, here.
I know what you did. I pulled the same trick myself to fake foie gras
in a hotel in Harrogate once, but I was young and stupid. What's your excuse?
we didn't have her requested items in stock.
that is not good enough.
you look at us with the eyes that would make a weak man die,
but you must believe.
I swear on the grave of my beloved.
we never believed that Arianna would come here today.
and she hasn't for the past three years. Look, it's not just us.
she has bookings all over town that she never keeps.
well, she's threatened to cancel her entire booking.
this is serious. She buys our suite for ten weeks every year.
that is guaranteed revenue.
now, has anyone got an idea of how to talk her round?
Tony, look, you're the brains here.
think of something. This is Arianna Adams, we cannot afford to lose her.
the shipping heiress? - Yes, Tony.
Oh, then we've lucked out.
I mean, I know what that's about, yeah, sure, sure.
I can think of a plan. I can think of a good plan.
geezer.
so, um...
put something straight for me.
why haven't we done this before?
I guess because I'm just a ditzy gofer and you're this...
incredible genius.
well, I haven't been smart enough to notice you, have I?
well, you're a busy man.
but you're smart, funny, beautiful.
if I had real brains, I'd wanna hang out with you the whole time.
I worry I'm...a little out of my depth with you.
and I think I'm a little out of my league with you.
what?
I'm worried that when you look at me all you see is a boring, middle-Aged grouch.
that's not at all true.
well, maybe if opposites attract, then I might have a chance with you.
a chance for what?
to kiss you.
you have every chance.
Oh, um...
you know, I'm gonna be back in a sec.
what?
Tony, this is very high-Risk. Are you sure you're up to it?
well, you just introduce me as the author and let me do my thing.
Hello? - Bobby? 6: 30.
things are kicking off.
Oh, yes... I'm a little bit busy right now.
I could really do without you being late.
well, yes, madam.
I'll have those...clothes with you very soon, OK?
Bobby... - Yeah. Bye.
OK? - Yeah, yeah.
OK. Here we go.
good luck. - Thank you.
should I do that up, do you think?
we'd like to make amends for our foolish mistake,
um...so there's someone here I think you'd like to meet.
do it.
Oh, my god. At last. I don't believe it.
I understand from your letters,
all your letters, that you're my biggest fan.
your books are extraordinary.
well, you know, some critics find them diffuse,
but they're really just intended as a response to the resurgent atavism of cultural structures.
you know, it's always been my ambition to elevate the language of schematic loss.
do you think that loss can be schematic?
Oh, yeah. - We'll just leave you to it.
thank you so much. I can't tell you how happy I am.
Yes!
where were we? - Oh, um...
I don't remember.
well...I was just saying how you had every chance to kiss me.
but if you're not gonna take that chance...
do you mind if I kiss you?
uh...you know...
Um...could you, um...
you...
put you here.
now, just stay there.
hold that thought. I'm gonna be right back.
you are gonna be very popular with your boss.
Why?
well, I impersonated you impersonating me.
it's quite complicated.
are you wearing lipstick? Mmm?
OK, loOK, don't be upset, but I noticed that you and Paige
liked each other, so I laid a bit of groundwork.
you kissed Paige?
no. Strictly speaking, she kissed me.
but the good news is she thought she was kissing you.
it's quite complicated.
what? What does it mean?
she definitely likes you.
Really? - And you like her.
thank you. - You're welcome.
I'll raise you 500.
you.
you are a genius.
how did you know Arianna was such a big fan of Bobby Mack's?
Yeah, all your "resurgent activism," eh,
and your "schemy loss," eh, Yankee boy?
now, I don't know what you were talking about up there,
but I've just spoken to Arianna, and she thinks she's met
her literary hero and she's keeping her booking.
Yes!
can you be quiet? We're trying to play some cards here.
what's going on?
your bet, Franklin.
you've got no money. I'm not walking away.
I'll write an IOU that will match any bet you make.
OK, let's raise the stakes.
all this...
plus Babylon.
for any one of your hotels.
Sam, you can't. - Keep out of this.
you came here to take my hotel, now I'm gonna take one of yours.
don't you dare accept this bet.
are you gonna name one? - No, he's not, are you, Damien?
the Crawford.
bit pompous for my taste, but it'll do.
Tanya, the river.
full house.
that's a very good hand...
but not as good as four kings.
uh...my solicitor will be contacting you with the paperwork.
what the hell just happened in there?
I thought it was my way back.
a pissing contest with Damien? - It's not...
he tried to walk all over me. I had to show him he couldn't do that.
it was a calculated gamble.
there's no such thing.
but if I'd have won, I'd have doubled my assets.
you lost.
it was bad luck, Juliet.
you can't build a life on luck, Sam.
give Sam his hotel back.
that's...not how gambling works.
this wasn't gambling.
you came here specifically to get Babylon.
Yes, that's what I wanted.
didn't you think about me? - This is all about you.
Well...answer these things about me, then.
who's my best friend? Where's my favourite place?
why does Chinese food make me sneeze?
we certainly drifted apart.
you don't know me, and you came here to buy Babylon so that you could give it to someone
who doesn't even want to be a hotel manager!
look, let's not talk out here, please.
I thought it was a way that we could spend more time together.
if you want to spend more time with me, don't buy a hotel as an excuse.
I'm sorry, I got it wrong. - Give Sam back his hotel.
you don't understand. He's a proud man.
it would crush him, being in my debt.
believe me, there is nothing I can do.
how'd it go?
he doesn't know how to give it back to Sam.
sorry, does any of this macho posturing make sense to any of the men in the room?
stop the funeral, I think I can save the hotel.
you're not gonna like it, but it's the best we've got.
OK, this is what we're gonna do.
hold the doors.
you're leaving us? - I've got what I came for.
title deeds to the hotel.
I was gonna get myself a drink before I left. Can I buy you one?
it looks like we could both do with one.
they're playing my song.
Hi. I've called the mechanic, but he'll be a while at this time of night, so I'll bring you some drinks, ok?
the booze is in. - Stage one complete.
played my first game when I was ten. My father cleaned me out.
told me I should learn that poker doesn't pay.
shame I didn't listen to him.
I've achieved quite a lot in my life,
but I've never been a successful father.
not that it's my place, or anything, but...
she's a very special girl. You should take time to get to know her.
I wish I had time.
bad news, I'm afraid???
the engineer's delayed, so you're gonna be stuck a while longer.
I've brought you some magazines, playing cards, radio.
I'll let you know when they arrive.
how's it going up there? - They've got the cards.
the rest is up to Sam.
hold this for me, will you?
I'm gonna try and get these doors open further.
we can't just wait all night, sitting on our hands.
we could play cards.
not a good idea.
wouldn't you like to win back Babylon?
Yes. - Well, now's your chance.
I'll bet you one hand - The hotel for this watch.
you wanna take everything I've got.
I've already got 12 hotels.
if I want another I can buy another. But this watch...
went to the moon.
OK.
we're gonna play Indian. You get one card...blind.
highest card wins. You get one change.
OK.
on three.
do you want to change?
no. You?
Mmm.
help. Help me!
was there supposed to be a second alarm?
I don't think so.
no, there wasn't.
hurry up. Hurry up!
Oh, my god, Sam, what's happened?
I think he's had a heart attack. Call an ambulance.
get these doors open!
ambulance, please.
Oh, god!
pull. Pull, guys.
he's stopped breathing.
Tanya, pass the defibrillator.
it's in a red box. - The red one!
Sam, I'm gonna pass this to you. Open it and I'll tell you what to do.
pull where it says "pull."
the plastic thing. - This?
and rip it off. - Yes.
OK, there's two pads. Put them on his chest.
OK.
can we turn it on? - OK, turn it on.
OK, it's charging.
OK, here we go. Here we go.
anything?
he's not breathing.
he's not breathing.
Tanya, I need the adrenalin. It's in a long plastic thing.
it's blue. LoOKs like a blue pen. - Come on.
that's it. - Here it is! Here it is!
get it in, get it in!
Oh, god! - OK, just slowly.
you're gonna be OK. You're gonna be OK.
he's not breathing.
dad?
daddy. Daddy, you're gonna be OK!
so that was a heart attack.
it...it wasn't unexpected. I had one four months ago.
you didn't tell me. - I didn't know how.
I could hardly tell you on the telephone or in an e-Mail.
that's why I came here.
I'm sorry.
apparently I have a chronic condition.
but I won't waste the last months of my life
without us ever getting to know each other.
I just...could never find the words to say...
to say what?
that i...
love you.
you just said it.
it's very simple, really, isn't it?
I mean, it's much cheaper than buying me a hotel.
wait.
want to know what card I had?
welcome back to the hotel business.
OK.
the best risks we take in life
are not when we gamble with money or possessions,
but when we're brave enough to risk our feelings.
what's happened? - Will he be all right?
don't worry. I'm sure he'll be OK.
can I get you anything? Taxi? Tickets for a show?
Oh, no, no. I think we're fine, thanks.
well, let me know if you need my help.
I suspect you've helped us enough already.
I think I've got it from here, thanks.
because if we win that gamble...
we get the biggest prize of all.
I need to collect all his stuff and bring it to the hospital for him.
is he all right? - I don't know.
I have to wait and see.
are you all right?
Yeah.
and you're gonna be all right together?
I hope so.
I really hope so.
maybe you'd like to come to my room.
your room?
we're hosting an entire convention with a skeleton staff.
the captain stranger appreciation society.
Oh, no. Not geeks.
this is Meredith Sutton, she's gonna be working with us for a few days.
you're Michael... - Martin.
who is this Meredith, anyway,
and has she facilitated your sleeping with her, by any chance?
morning. - Good morning.
Ahoy.
this is never gonna happen between us. There's too much history.
I resign.
spring
a time when people pull back the bedcovers and get down on their hands and knees with one goal in mind
cleaning.
from our 1, 000-thread-count sheets to the cobwebs in the corner, everything receives a spit and a polish.
you need to do the whole corridor.
great, girls.
my fault. I'll get it.
nothing is overlooked.
we all strive for perfection.
no, no.
Ben, leave it.
but sometimes we need to bring in a little outside help.
thanks for fitting us in. My pleasure. Where shall we start?
shall we take a seat?
I need it delivered today... Well, can you find out?
yes?
there's no way I can accommodate that booking.
Oh, God, that's the last thing I need.
sorry.
who's that woman with Sam?
I don't know.
right, since records began, this weekend has been notorious for its high vacancy rates.
Yes. The dead weekend, as it's known. It's bliss.
so I've just done a deal with an organisation to hold its annual convention here.
?? We're a bit short-staffed this week, so we'll all have to pitch in a bit.
Sam, did you hear that?
150 guests in a single phone call.
Mm-hm, I heard.
could you tell the corners of your mouth?
sorry, Jules, but as it is a slow time of the year, I chose this weekend to do a spot of team-building.
Team-building? Yeah.
there's a motivational expert waiting for us in the Artemis Room to help us brush up on our communication and team skills
work out our personality types, see how we all fit in together.
we'll just be doing some exercises. Think of it as a bit of spring-cleaning.
you never mentioned this to me. I never got a chance.
what was that about communication skills?
so if we do bad at this team-building, do you sack us or...?
there have been a few situations lately.
I just want to confirm I've got the right people.
how is this going to work now that we're hosting an entire convention with a skeleton staff?
well, we'll make it work.
so, what group is it?
sorry?
you never said what group is holding the convention.
the Captain Stranger Appreciation Society.
they're having a ball this evening and non-stop screenings and signings tomorrow.
who is this Captain Stranger?
it's a rubbish '70s sci-fi show about space pirates.
no, not geeks.
and what have they ever done to you?
?? I was stuck on a coach all the way from Salamanca to Costa Blanca with the Spanish Star Trek fan club.
they sing songs in Klingon all the way six hours.
I still have the nightmares.
well, geeks or not, once they check in, it's your job to make them leave here happy, that's all.
Sam, you should have mentioned this earlier so I could have talked you out of it.
don't worry, Jules, you'll be fine.
What?! I have to do it too? You'll breeze through it.
Juliet, I've just heard I have to do some team-building course.
are you not happy with my work since Anna left?
no, Ben, you have performed remarkably well as acting head receptionist.
good. I'm sure you'll breeze through it.
Sam wants me out
I knew I'd gone too far with that liver-and-onion ice cream on last month's menu.
I'm no good at tests. That's why I end up in housekeeping.
well, I say, "Bring it on." You guys are all going down.
well, if it's a test, I'm copying Emily.
no, it's not that sort of a test.
it's where we drive go-go-karts and shoot paintballs at each other.
?? No, it's gonna be three hours of motivational mumbo jumbo from some fat, sweaty bloke with a beard.
everybody, this is Meredith Sutton, and she's gonna be working with us next couple of days.
hello.
when do we start shooting the paintballs, hey?
?? What?
what about the go-go-karts? We won't do that, either.
now, I know that some of you may be cynical about people like me, but all I ask is that you approach this with an open mind.
sorry.
Thanks.
we'll have two game sessions in here today, followed by the main event tomorrow
a real-time practical session to test your teamwork and see if I've done my job properly.
now, shall we get started?
the goal is to flip over the tarpaulin without anyone touching the ground.
is this how you decide who's sacked? The first one off gets the chop.
Gino, hands off! I did nothing.
now, the side you're on is where you are professionally.
the other side is where you want to be.
you can't make the transition without working together.
this is the most pointless and ridiculous thing I have ever done for Sam, and that's saying something.
count yourself lucky you don't have Gino's hands all over you.
Oh, sorry, sorry.
?? I've got you. Don't worry.
sorry, for how many weeks?
am I crazy, or was that OK? Yes. Surprisingly, yes.
I can't believe we did so well. Yeah, I won.
I thought there was no winners in these games.
Yeah. No, I definitely won.
the point was to show we work together well as a team.
but don't we always? Exactly.
a complete waste of time and money.
well, that minky Meredith can boss me around any time.
it's actually better than shooting people with paintballs.
unless those people are James.
Oh, very funny.
I wonder what she has planned for us next.
well, after this morning, nothing would faze me.
except that.
battle stations, everyone. The nerds have landed.
Juliet Miller? Yes.
Ferris Carlisle. President of CSAS.
the Captain Stranger Appreciation Society.
ahoy! Ahoy.
you received my itinerary? Yes, I did.
how is your ballroom ventilation? Excuse me?
one of our members has a smoke machine for our masquerade ball.
I want to confirm that won't be a problem.
I think that's the least of your worries.
sublime. Ahoy!
Ahoy.
sir.
sir! What?
late night, was it? Do you need me to help you to your room?
no, no. I can manage.
I've got a key card somewhere.
must have dropped it.
you're not really a guest with us, are you, sir?
Yeah, fine. I'll just...pack my stuff and you'll never see me again.
hang on a minute.
I would have expected better service from a first-class hotel.
your voice you used to be on TV, didn't you?
Yes, you did.
you hosted that kids' news programme. Yeah, that's it. You're Michael...
Oh, my God, your show was brilliant, especially those panda stories you always did.
Yeah, you can't beat a good panda.
so, what are you doing kipping in a luxury hotel?
well, it beats a shop doorway. But you're famous.
I haven't worked in six years.
I mean, you can't just stay here. Why not? I've been doing it for weeks.
what?
morning.
the nicer the hotel, the less likely the staff are to bother you.
?? Someone must have said something.
no, no.
they always think I'm an eccentric millionaire.
thank you. It was working really well.
I never stayed long enough to be noticed.
at least until now.
I mean, couldn't you just go back into presenting?
you know, start again?
Yeah, I could, but I left under a bit of a cloud.
Oh, my God. You had an affair, didn't you, with your teenage assistant?
what? Well, it was all over the news.
OK, right, she was 22, and it wasn't an affair.
it was just a one-off thing, really.
and when my wife found out well, my ex-wife
she took me to the cleaners.
So...you've just given up?
Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.
but nobody's gonna give me a job.
but thank you for being so discreet.
and as I used to say on the show, Goodbye, cheerio, farewell.
can I take your bags for you? Oh, thank you.
the convention's never been in a place this nice.
we hope you enjoy it here so much that you come back every year.
if you need anything else, my name's Tony.
you'll find me at the concierge desk.
Thanks. Um... I'm meant to tip now, aren't I?
that's purely at your discretion, actually, sir.
?? 20 about right?
Yes, that's very generous. Thank you, sir.
come on, hurry.
one of the geeks cancelled a Time Lord convention in Barnstaple.
So...get yourself cleaned up, get some rest and I'll come for you in the morning.
Thanks, Bill. Oh, it's Ben.
and it's fine. What else am I gonna do?
you're my childhood hero. Come on.
Oh, hey, hey, please, can you say that thing for me one more time?
giant pandas enjoy forested habitats with a deep understorey of bamboo.
Oh, my gosh, I hear that and I'm eight all over again.
quick.
everything OK, Ben? Yes, it is.
room 409 needed some ice, so that's what I'm doing
delivering some ice to room 409.
Er...this is 402.
come on. So, how have you been?
so, how were they? Suitably teamy?
the teamiest. No, I'm impressed.
but, um...did I say something to offend Juliet?
she's just a little frustrated with the timing, that's all.
sure she doesn't just think I'm full of corporate-speak nonsense and resents me teaching her how to work better?
I'll win her round. I usually do.
have you worked together long? No, not really.
but then there was the whole four years of marriage.
what? You're...? Were.
sorry. Not interrupting, am I?
Meredith and I were just going for lunch.
do you want to join us? Um, bit busy, actually.
all I can ask is, bear with it. What?
well, you don't feel it's helping yet.
not at all. I felt tremendously united standing on a tarpaulin.
well, maybe we can have a coffee this afternoon and talk it over.
maybe.
I'll be out in a minute.
yes? Meredith is one of the best.
she has a degree from Cambridge and a masters from Harvard.
I don't care if she built Hubble, she doesn't know how to do my job.
how do you think I grew my business?
I learnt. I got in people like Meredith to help.
fine. I will do the course. And...?
and, yes, I will take it very seriously. I promise.
very nice.
Gino, you're drooling.
OK, you have just three minutes to build one of three objects
a tower, a bridge or a house.
building with blocks how... beneficial to our careers.
the catch is, only Juliet can see the blueprint.
this is a test of your communication skills.
all right, then.
?? What?!
I'm feeling very ambitious, and so we're going to build a tower.
OK.
we need two square-y bits. OK.
Yeah, yeah, nice one.
Yeah. And some sort of... Squares?
like a squiggly bit, Gino.
just for that... Interlock it with Gino's squiggly bit.
I always wanted to interlock with you.
hang on. Give me the blueprints.
Juliet's in charge!
?? Come on!
?? Sorry, sorry, OK, OK.
the green piece goes with the interlocking piece.
time's up.
right, well, obviously that was a fail, I'm afraid.
I am available for extensions, loft conversions...
OK, everyone, back to work.
have you got a minute?
about earlier I'm sorry.
you said you'd take it seriously. I did.
no, you didn't, Juliet. You paid it lip-service.
I know you. I know how good you are.
if you wanted, you'd have passed. I know, but it...
all I wanted was half an hour of your time.
think how it makes you look.
to me, to Meredith, but more importantly, to the team.
Meredith? You think I care what I look like to her?
well, you should. This is costing me 15 grand.
you're supposed to be leading our team. You couldn't lead a trip to the zoo!
because I failed her little game?
Sam, I've got a lot on this weekend. This is hardly a priority.
look, I make one slip-up and suddenly I can't run the hotel.
Oh, stop being so defensive.
no, I am defensive because I am good at my job.
and if anything, I have over-performed in my time here.
Yes, you have.
but, please, there's one more task to do tomorrow.
just...take it seriously, OK?
who is this Meredith, anyway? What?
Oh, I told you, she's one of the top facilitation consultants.
and has she facilitated your sleeping with her, by any chance?
I know you're not happy, Juliet, but I'm still your boss.
so, what's a nice human like you doing in a place like this?
to be honest, I'm not really sure myself.
I've never been to a hotel as posh as this before.
Oh, well, to mark the occasion, let me buy you a drink.
specials.
Alaksian Fireball,
Hordovean Mantasater, or a Gargolean Liquidiser.
Yeah, I googled Captain Stranger. These are all names from the shows.
what are they really?
that's red wine, white wine and that's lager.
Oh, you have a pretty laugh. Thank you.
I'm Mary.
you have a pretty name too. I'm Gino.
I have a joke for your laugh.
there's an alien.
he walk into a bar and sit down next to a drunk, and he starts poking him in the shoulder.
the drunk see that the alien is naked, look down, and the drunk say, "Hey, you got no genitals. How do you have sex?"
and the alien just smile...
and continue poking him in the shoulder.
I love that.
comic shop. OK, so, we're here, yeah?
this is Shaftesbury Avenue.
if you go down to there, you'll find a good comic shop there.
and if you go into High Holborn, which is over here, you'll find a model shop there, I think.
Oh, that's excellent. Thanks, Tony.
you can have that. Oh, cheers.
thank you, sir. Thank you.
that's when the ox went for him.
and to this day, nobody has tried to deliver post to our house again.
no, that can't be true. Yeah, I'm afraid it is.
I suppose now you think Gino is some kind of country pumpkin.
of course not. I don't think that at all.
no? No.
I'm glad, because I want to make a good impression on such a beautiful lady.
I've enjoyed talking to you.
I need to get to bed. Yeah, of course, of course.
you must be tired and... No, I'm not tired. I...
well, I was hoping that maybe you'd like to come to my room.
Gino? Your...room?
you're in there, son.
Mary, can I ask you, is your father a thief?
because he stole the clouds out of the sky and put them in your eyes.
it's stars, not clouds. Oh, stars.
what are you up to?
just pampering myself.
you don't do pampering.
don't tell me you've got a date. Hey, don't sound so surprised.
no, I'm not. But come on, tell me.
who is this curious individual?
Jimbo, do you know never kiss and tell, hey?
Oh, jeez.
Louisa, can you find out what room Gwendoline Cook is in for me, please?
sure.
Gino, is there a cologne tanker run aground?
just pampering myself, you know.
here you are for your pampering.
thank you. I hope she likes it.
she will. I...
I didn't see you. Oh, thank you.
so this is the busiest slow weekend we've had in a while.
are we at capacity? Almost.
I'm bloody knackered, and this team-building isn't helping.
I know you think it's nonsense, but most of us are entering into the spirit of it.
is that a dig? I know you think it's bollocks.
and to be frank, so do I.
but it does seem important to Sam.
people are worried what will happen if we don't do well.
and to do well, we do need your help.
Tanya! What are you doing up here?
one of the guests had too much to drink and I just wanted to check that she...you know, that HE was OK.
with a rose?
Yeah, well, he's a very good guest. He eats a lot of peanuts.
OK.
Hi.
Hi, Tanya.
so you find a tramp sleeping in the hotel, and instead of chucking him out, you give him a room.
he was only doing it out of kindness.
it's easy to be kind with someone else's money.
he was sleeping on the streets.
?? You might be, if you're not careful. I thought you had more sense.
Oh, please, he meant no harm.
hang on. Um...say something else.
describe the contents of the room.
OK.
well, there's a desk over there, and there's a sofa, and a lovely flower arrangement in a vase...
now say, Back to the story of Flo, the donkey trapped in a pothole.
back to the story of Flo, the donkey trapped in the pothole.
Oh, my God!
you're Martin Armstrong!
I used to watch you every day after school.
you used to talk about the... The pandas!
the pandas. I know, I know the pandas!
?? Oh, God, there was this story of the mother panda who looked after the little, um...the little puppy.
Oh, Frisky. Yeah, Frisky the puppy. Naughty, naughty Frisky.
Oh, Frisky.
?? Juliet, I'm sorry. I'm gonna pay for the room and I'm gonna...
no, no, no, no. Ben, it's fine.
it's fine. I think Martin may be able to pay for the room himself.
thank you for calling Hotel Babylon.
unfortunately, all our operators are busy at the moment, but please hold and your call will be answered as soon as possible.
was that OK? Cos, see, I'm just a bit out of practice.
it's brilliant. Listen.
thank you for calling Hotel Babylon...
it sounds, er... It sounds OK.
what's the matter? It's perfect. Yeah.
that's just it. I haven't heard my voice in years.
I look in the mirror and I see a man whose whole life has slipped away.
but that...that's still me. That's the person I used to be.
Hey, you never know, this could be the start of a whole new career.
now, will Mr Armstrong be taking his complimentary breakfast in the restaurant tomorrow?
Yeah, yeah, that'll make a nice change from the corridor.
you're lucky. You've got a strong mix of personality types here.
is that good?
it makes for a bonded, capable workforce.
for example, Ben's a performer, James is a realist,
Tony's a counsellor.
Juliet's...
a what?
well, she's actually a little conflicted.
Juliet's good. I've no doubt she is.
but, um...are you sure you're able to judge, with your history?
well, I've never really thought about it like that.
wait until you see the results of tomorrow's session.
so, what personality type are you?
what do you THINK I am?
Ah, there's a question.
...lone ranger.
that's more accurate than you think.
Oh, don't get me wrong, I love what I do
travelling the world, getting people to see past the jargon and silly slogans.
I feel a "but" coming on.
but...it gets a bit lonely.
be nice to stay in one place for a bit.
with the right people.
morning.
good morning.
where are you going?
the little boys' room.
hurry back.
Primarola, you are a god of love, hey?
what, me? Yeah, you, you, hey?
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
my God!
Gino. Oh, Mary!
I...want to...
I...is...is this your room? Yeah, course it's my room.
because I...
what, those? Yeah.
they're Captain Stranger vintage figurines.
Yeah, for your nephew? No.
your son? No.
no, they're mine.
this is the third-best collection in western Europe.
that's why I'm here... for the convention.
look, don't you think this one looks like me?
Yeah. Ahoy.
Yeah, I...just think...
I think that, er...
I have to...I have to, er...
go to the, er...you know, to a thing.
to a...thing.
no, I don't believe it.
Gino had a date with a guest?
I saw him going into her room last night.
well, good for him, I say.
but I haven't told you the best bit.
she's staying in a block of rooms reserved for Captain Stranger fan club.
No! Yes.
wait, wait. Are you saying that Gino...bagged a geek?
Yes!
morning.
ahoy!
Oh, I see. Gino's love life is public information now, is it?
affirmative, Captain.
for your information, I didn't know she was a geek until this morning.
and gorgeous though she is, I do not intend to continue the courtship.
Why? Because she's a sci-fi nerd? Hey, you don't know.
you've never had a Romulan describe how warpy drive works for three hours, hey?
these people, they're not human. Isn't that the point?
you know what I mean.
now, I want to be alone. Please, may I?
see you later for the final session...maybe.
don't be a stranger.
I couldn't resist!
Sam, this came for you.
thank you.
Sam, I need you to authorise this.
I was out of line yesterday.
and I'm sorry I didn't do the task properly.
but I do maintain that in the real world, I am actually very capable.
well, maybe I'm not the best person to judge.
not with our history and everything.
what's that supposed to mean? It means that you and I...
Meredith's an impartial professional, OK?
she really has poisoned you with her business bullshit, hasn't she?
I don't want to hear it, Juliet. Whatever the task is, do it right.
do something right, please.
well, can't you just beam the Captain Stranger posters over?
it's only organic matter.
well, in that case, a courier will have to do, then.
excuse me. Hi.
I'm Gail Wallis Strong. Nancy from Captain Stranger.
I was the show's leading lady.
do you know, I'm the only actress ever to be BAFTA short-listed for playing an entire episode in an alien language?
how can I help you?
I need you to keep this somewhere very safe for me.
I'll need it later for my autograph session.
Yes, it's real gold. it is.
it was a gift from my executive producer.
I always use it for signing autographs.
??I'll give it to our general manager. She can keep it in the hotel safe.
can I get you to sign something?
why not? It's a receipt so that you can claim your pen back at the end.
thank you.
mr Mason, did that projector make it up to your room OK?
it did indeed, Tony. Thanks. Oh, good.
Gino. I've been looking all over for you. You left in a hurry.
to be honest, Mary, I'm not supposed to fraternise with the guests.
Gino, this is Rhodri.
Rhodri, Gino. Ahoy.
you're right, Mary, he looks exactly like the leader of the Tronks.
what? I'll see you later.
we're just off to a panel meet with Gail Wallis Strong.
I've been dying to talk to her.
do you wanna join us?
I think I've got a lot of things to do, so...
OK.
maybe I'll see you later, then?
I think maybe I got a lot of things to do later as well.
I see.
OK.
Bye, Gino.
Gino, who's that?
that's the geek. Oh, the geek?
she's beautiful.
she's a geek. So? She's stunning. Is she nice?
she has all the little plastic action dolls.
she has all the little guns.
if I tell you a secret, do you promise not to tell anybody?
Yeah, you promise?
I'm a morris dancer. What?
I like morris dancing.
?? I could lie and say that my parents forced me to do it, but the truth is, I really enjoy it.
I never knew.
have you ever wondered why I take every May Day off?
come to think of it, no.
if you did wonder, you would find me in Penge dancing around a maypole as if my life depended upon it.
what about the outfit? The outfit?
that's my favourite part.
good morning, Martin. Ah, Juliet...
I wasn't sure if seconds were allowed.
they're compulsory. Right.
Juliet, I've got that number you wanted.
perfect.
Martin, have you heard of a man called Lawrence Kane?
lawrence Kane, as in Kane Media International?
Yes. Well, he's a regular guest here.
he mentioned that he was setting up an internet news service.
I was thinking of giving him a ring to see if he'd consider meeting you.
I'm not sure I'm ready for a meeting with Lawrence Kane.
we'll freshen you up. We'll get you a new suit. You'll be great.
OK, so what do we tell Sam? I'll worry about Sam.
me, cover the bar?
Gino needs to sort things out with Mary.
it's the best chance he's had since we've known him.
it's the only chance he's had since we've known him.
doors opening.
Tony, have you heard the new lift voice?
I have, actually. I like it. You?
Yeah, it's good.
Sam, hi.
Where's Gino? Oh, he fell.
on his...leg.
is he all right? Oh, he'll be fine.
right.
I tried this great Scotch the other night. Here's the supplier's number.
tell Gino to get some in. Will do, boss.
and you are powerless to do anything about it.
the people will fight your army of Drogs with all their might.
?? You have no hope of defeating them, even with all the Yagarian shuttle craft in the universe.
can't see. Sorry.
I want to talk.
is that Captain Stranger's spaceship?
what? That old crate?
it's the Yagarian shuttle craft.
do you wanna watch?
do you wanna...sit here? Do you mind?
captain Stranger, is that you?
Yes, it's me, Nancy.
Ahoy.
I have a plan, Nancy.
turn around.
and Sam was OK about getting him a 1000 pound suit?
sure. Payment for becoming the voice of Babylon.
Well...good luck, Martin.
Yeah, thanks.
Juliet, sorry, I completely forgot.
Gail Wallis Strong's gold pen. She uses it to sign autographs.
she wants you to keep it safe.
Juliet... Oh, my God, why am I doing this?
he'll remember everything, won't he, about my past?
he'll remember you're good.
you are good.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I was...quite good.
and this is the right thing to do. So good luck.
and I shall meet you back here at four for all the gory details.
did you like it?
I know this wasn't the best episode to introduce you to the show.
you didn't like it, did you?
no.
I loved it.
Really? Yeah.
Hey, what's going on?
Yeah, well, maybe I can watch one more, hey?
Ahoy. Ahoy.
captain, are we backing out yet?
negative.
Where's Gino? We can't start without him.
he's probably helping a guest.
inspecting her forward thrusters, no doubt.
here I am. Sorry, everybody.
right, this is the culmination of all you've learned on my course.
a crisis is the ultimate test for any team's effectiveness.
so, today, you'll be taking part in a fire drill.
we've closed the top floor of the hotel.
and these assignment cards will guide you through what to do.
my gosh, this is so exciting.
I have an injury.
I've got to do this bit American. Make it more dramatic, hey?
do I get an assignment card? No. You're the team leader.
um, doesn't anyone else ever get to be leader?
?? Surely I could.
Juliet's the general manager. She'll lead the task.
the rest of you report to your positions.
?? Right.
shall we?
doors opening.
I love this new lift voice.
doors closing. Here, you'll need this.
Thanks.
the exercise is a fire simulation. It starts when those doors open.
you have six minutes to evacuate 20 trapped guests.
good luck, Jules.
ninth floor. Doors opening.
Juliet, this is Tanya.
one of the cleaners has reported smoke filling the hallways on the top floor.
OK, I'm on my way.
Juliet, you cannot take an active role. Your job is to co-ordinate.
now, the fire engines are en route. Right.
Ben. Ben, where are you?
I'm right here. Copy that.
Roger, roger. Over.
Hi, Juliet. Hi, Ben.
OK, everybody, check the rooms, and any guests, bring them to the north staircase for evacuation go.
20 seconds gone.
thanks for covering me at the bar.
me and Mary have had a breakthrough. I think I'm in love.
I'm glad to hear it. I don't pull pints for anything less.
Gino, James, get a move on. Use your key cards and empty every room.
Hey, wait a minute. I haven't got my key card.
come on. He has to have a key card. This isn't part of the exercise.
that's strange. I never lose my key card.
never mind. Just take mine. OK.
two minutes and ten seconds gone. Just every minute will do.
?? So there's another one in 904?
we're moving them too slowly. What is taking so long?
this corridor is now filled with smoke.
OK, James, just move as fast as you can.
the fire has now spread to the staircase.
we move.
remember, Juliet stop, assess and react.
we move to the south staircase.
there are so many people.
I'm sorry. This woman is seriously injured.
if I move here any more, she may die.
OK, just, um...leave them all here.
Emily, Tanya, tend to the injured. Keep low, everybody??
OK, OK.
recovery position.
five minutes.
did you get them all out?
according to the card, the smoke is too thick.
Gino's trapped in one of the rooms. OK, we leave him.
are you sure you want to leave one of your staff?
?? ?? Nobody try to save Gino?
look, we can't risk trying to rescue him.
but I don't want to die. Enough, Gino!
just take those people, put them in that room and keep them by the window. OK, OK.
I was supposed to die of smoke inhalation two minutes ago. Sorry.
Oh, Ben. Oh, God, I never really got the chance to know him.
?? Get these people and keep moving them into that room.
Where's James? I've no idea.
but you were the last person to see him. James, where are you?
apparently I'm on fire in 903.
do you want me to go and get him?
no, just keep moving these bloody people. Come on, keep moving!
and that's time. What?!
come on back, everybody.
six minutes have passed, the roof has collapsed and the building hasn't been evacuated.
everyone's dead.
I'm very sorry, Juliet.
you did your best.
let's go have a cup of tea or something. Something stronger, perhaps.
come on, Ben. I'll buy you a drink.
so...
...this is death.
no-one tried to save me.
none of you are invited to my funeral, hey?
Hi, everyone.
Ben, could I have a word, please?
that test was tough.
well, I was the only one that failed, but thank you.
listen, Ben, have you seen Martin?
he was supposed to be at my office at four o'clock.
maybe the interview didn't go well.
Oh, you.
I gave that little blonde person... Emily.
I gave her a very valuable pen earlier for safekeeping.
I'd like it back now, please. Of course, madam.
well, immediately. I've got fans waiting.
they expect me to use that pen. It's rather famous.
have it sent to my room.
I understand. Thanks.
Kane's unreachable.
and his assistant's gone home for the day.
Emily, that Strange Captain actress...
captain Stranger. Sorry. ?? She left a pen for us to hold, but I checked the safe and it's not there.
Emily gave me the pen when I was with a guest.
it should still be on my desk. I checked there nothing.
Sam, could I have a word in private?
here is fine.
OK.
the guest I was with is Martin Armstrong.
he's an ex-TV presenter. Oh, Mr Panda.
Yes. Well, he's homeless, and, um...I've been helping him out.
helping him out how?
well, he recorded the new voices for the answerphone and the lifts.
I arranged a job interview for him, bought him a new suit smarten him up.
with what?
with...some of the hotel money.
how much?
right, so you take in a tramp, buy him a suit with the hotel's money, and he repays you by stealing a guest's property.
no, we don't even know that he's taken the pen.
well, of course he's taken the pen.
God, you really are a soft target.
when are you gonna stop being so bloody naive?
at least when I'm taken in by people, it's because I am trying to help them, rather than make a quick buck out of them, like you.
What?! That's got nothing to do with it.
the point is, you screwed up. Once!
I screwed up once. The amount of times that I've had to bail you out...
and I never wanted your help. The amount of your shit...
I never asked you to interfere.
Meredith is right.
this is never gonna happen between us. There's too much history.
well, let me clear up any ambiguity for you.
I resign.
fine.
right.
effective immediately.
so much for team-building.
I haven't done anything wrong. I've just...
all I wanted to do was just come in for a couple of minutes.
Gino. What's going on?
Gail came back to her room for a rest and this crazy woman was waiting for her.
I only wanted to talk to her. That girl is unbalanced.
I've seen this sort of thing before.
well, how did you get in the room?
Mary, how did you get in the room?
I borrowed this. You stole my key card.
I didn't think you'd mind, seeing as you're a fan now.
give me back the card.
Oh, come on, Gino. It's no big deal.
Mary, you broke into her room.
it just went too far. I wanted to talk to her, give her a hug.
maybe take a lock of her hair.
she's my hero, Gino.
why didn't you ask me?
I was worried you'd say no.
go and get your things from your room and leave the hotel.
What?! My mind is made up.
look, I really, really like you.
I didn't mean for this.
you used me. Sorry, Mary.
I'm sorry too, Gino.
Ahoy.
I'm sorry about that.
wanderer In The Dark. Yes.
...that you were fantastic.
thank you.
there you are.
do you want to award the course completion certificates to your staff, or should I?
no, you can do it.
I'm really sorry it worked out like this with Juliet, but don't beat yourself up about it.
it's just so frustrating. I don't know what went wrong.
no offence, but part of me wishes you'd never come here.
Sam, sometimes what I do reveals painful truths too.
Yeah.
I just don't know what I'm gonna do without her.
you need to make a fresh start.
look, if you're really in a bind, I could probably pitch in for a bit.
I told you I studied hotel management as part of my masters.
what? You wanna do Juliet's job?
just until you find someone else.
I spent over the half the year on the road last year.
I'd love to stay in one place for a bit.
am I being too pushy?
I probably am.
forget I said anything.
final task.
it says here the roof collapses after 12 minutes.
you gave Juliet six.
well, technically, yes, but it's open to interpretation.
I altered the parameters to better demonstrate Juliet's character under extreme pressure.
you sabotaged her.
I was just trying to help illustrate her shortcomings.
think of her in the other tasks.
I was just doing what I thought was best.
I think you should go.
but, Sam, it was... Get out!
is this a bad time? Who are you?
I'm Martin Armstrong. Is Juliet around?
only I need to tell her my good news and, er...to return her bling.
mr Mason.
good weekend? Oh, yes.
this is the highlight of my year.
cue boring librarian joke.
you're a librarian?
you are a librarian. Yeah, it pays the bills...just.
but the time I get with these wonderful people is worth all the scrimping and saving during the year.
thanks again for all your kindness, Tony.
Oh, no...
I'm sorry, Mr Mason, I've just realised that this week is No Tipping Week.
Oh, really? Yes, all the big hotels do it, and I neglected to tell you, so sorry about that.
Oh, great.
thank you, Tony.
excuse me.
miss Wallis Strong, I once again do apologise about the whole pen thing.
Yes, most unfortunate.
I would've complained to your manager, but apparently, you haven't got one now.
all of these people are so fixated on you.
does that not get to you after a while?
I enjoy it.
when I do these events for a few hours every year, I'm a star again.
come along, Ferris. Oh, one last thing.
could I have your autograph?
I don't think so.
boss. Not now, Tony.
you shouldn't have let her go.
I know, I know. I'm an idiot. I'll get her back, Tony.
brother Tony.
don't want the others to hear. What?
I couldn't believe it when Gino told me.
Gino told you what?
about your hobby.
you know, the...
are you all right? The morris dancing.
I had no idea you did it too.
maybe this year we can hit the maypole together.
I've never been morris dancing, James.
I only told Gino that to make him see reason.
Yes, me too. I've never been, either.
so, do you wear those little sashes?
they're called baldrics.
so, you still come here when you need to get away?
and you always said I was the one who'd never change.
I live round the corner.
I'm sorry, Jules. I was wrong about everything.
I was wrong about Meredith, I was wrong about Martin.
he came back? Yeah. And he got the job.
he took the pen to make a good impression.
well, at least somebody's career is taking off.
Meredith fixed the final task.
you actually did pretty well.
turns out she was after your job.
what a bitch.
remember when we used to dream about buying that place?
you wanted your bed by the window so you could see the boats.
we never even set foot inside it.
actually, I did.
did you?
when?
after the divorce.
when I started making money.
had a viewing. Thought about buying the place.
but it felt weird without you.
come back.
come back to the hotel.
I don't think so.
please, Jules.
I need you.
Hi.
thank you all for staying late.
as you know, we've had some turbulent times recently, and Juliet's resignation came as a shock to us all.
I want to put that behind us and move forward.
and with that in mind, I'd like to introduce you to her replacement.
if you could come in, please.
Oh, my God!
I can't believe you made me do that! Gotta have a sense of occasion.
welcome back, Juliet. How did you manage that?
I just presented her with the facts.
when that didn't work, he grovelled?? A bit, a bit.
well, we like to hold on to the good ones round here.
?? Welcome back.
spring-cleaning is about renewal, change.
and sometimes you need to change everything just to realise that all along, the so-called mess was pretty close to perfect.
you're looking pleased with yourself.
?? I've got the right people in the right places.
I could've saved you some money and told you that.
or given it to me. I'm short on tips this week.
where is Gino? He's missing all the fun.
I saw him go into the staff office. I'll ask him if he wants to come.
carry on. Juliet, welcome back.
to Juliet.
not joining us, Gino? No, I...
tonight, Gino enjoy the company of a stranger.
Really? OK.
well, watching this show help me remember the good times.
forget about the bad.
well, enjoy.
sorry it didn't work out with Mary, Gino.
me too.
me too.
go, Captain, go!
ahoy!
next time on babylon
is that that fish kid?
we've got Mandy Warren staying with us the next couple of days
only 16 but an Olympic hopeful.
Alexis Warren Mandy's mother.
you know Mandy's getting paid peanuts for this ad.
they're ripping her off, aren't they?
you're my trainee? Lovely bistro you've got here, guv.
excuse me, I...I'm so sorry.
gennaro Fazio, editor, Certo! magazine.
tomorrow's royal wedding has been cancelled.
can we get someone to pretend to be the princess?
and the fiance?
this whole thing is a fake.
never have I been so glad to have the parents that I have.
what is going on?
we've got 48 hours to make this place fit for a princess, literally, so work your magic.
even when we're preparing for a royal wedding, 'we're always hiding something.'
Thanks.
and no matter what we see...
um, perhaps the rear exit, Minister?
...rest assured, we'll keep it firmly under our hats.
my Italian readers will love these wedding pictures.
a European princess marrying her English love. Perfect. Great.
Thanks. - Oh, excuse me.
I'm so sorry. Forgive me.
gennaro Fazio, editor, Certo! magazine.
Oh. Juliet Miller, general manager.
good day.
tax demand ￡210, 000 Please pay this now - Certo! magazine? - Italian celeb rag.
this is how you make a deal.
our royal couple won't pay us a penny for their wedding, but in return, we get the photo rights, which Certo! magazine will pay 250 grand for.
so we're sorted. Why are you looking like that?
I've just come off the phone from Liechtenstein.
the bride's run off with a Canadian equerry.
the wedding's cancelled.
that's the thing with brushing things under the carpet.
sometimes the carpet gets moved. - Shit.
what if we went ahead? With a wedding, I mean.
Er...I don't think that would be too cost effective, you know, without a bride, a groom, guests.
what if we had a bride, a groom and guests?
what do you mean, "A bride and groom"?
Oh, you know, couldn't we get someone to pretend to be the princess?
you know, and the fiance.
you mean fake a wedding? - Uh-huh.
um, Sam, I'm waiting for the punch line. - No punch line.
it's just our tax bill came in and it's a little larger than I expected.
well, then, go to the bank, like a normal person.
I tried. I'm mortgaged up to the eyeballs.
and my credit rating's...Well, you know what happened to my investments, and I was really counting on this photo money.
Sam, it's fraud. - It's PR.
I mean, Fazio had never even heard of the royal couple.
he...he just wanted a spread, and, you know, maybe he wouldn't care even if it was fake.
well, what happens when the real princess finds out?
well, we just...we change her name. She's not Princess Sylvie, she's...Princess Marianne, you know, a distant relative.
it's a hell of a risk. - It's a calculated risk.
no, no. Find some other way of making the money.
look, Jules, didn't we agree to work together not so long ago?
I can't do this without you.
OK, First things first-- we've got Mandy Warren is staying here for two days.
shark girl? - Yes.
"shark girl" to the papers. Only 16, but an Olympic hopeful.
and she's here filming an ad for Riposte swimwear.
now, I want her kept super-happy, so everyone in full boot-licking mode.
spend a lot of money, does she?
we are getting a healthy slice of the ad fee, so anything she wants, she gets.
so keep an eye on her, OK? - Will do.
now, James, you're aware of the new addition.
another acne-ridden, 17-year-old granny stabber, I'm sure.
what's that? - It's the latest government employment scheme, and James has a restaurant trainee for a couple of days.
Yes, and no doubt with an ASBO for every pimple.
well, just do your best.
now, as you are all aware, tomorrow's royal wedding has been cancelled.
I was looking forward to meeting the princess.
I had my hair cut and everything.
well, you may still get the chance...ish.
we're going ahead with it anyway - the wedding.
what? What do you mean?
Er...due to a small accounting error, we can't afford to lose the revenue.
a wedding with no bride or groom?
Oh, there'll be a bride and groom, they just won't be all that real.
we're gonna fake it.
my fault. I dropped us in it.
that's a big drop.
but the truth is, we need the money for a tax bill, one that gets very big and very scary unless we pay it very quickly.
we made a deal with an Italian magazine for the photos.
all we do is dress up a bride and groom for some wedding snaps that'll only be seen in Italy, and Bob's your uncle.
it won't work. - We'll make it work.
celebrities fake relationships all the time when they're flogging something.
exactly.
we're not agreeing to this? Juliet?
the alternative is we bring in some investors, - sell off part of the hotel. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
new management, when we just start working like an oily machine?
no. I'm sure all your jobs will be safe.
look, I think the idea's a little bit bonkers, but I don't want to lose my job, so you're the boss.
if you say do it, I right behind you.
well, in my humble opinion, this is madness.
what choice do we have? - Thank you.
OK, The wedding's still set for tomorrow, so we've got plenty of time.
Gino, find some cheap fizz. Emily, we need your help with the costumes.
James, we need a budget banquet. - Oh!
we need expensive-looking on the outside, but cheap on the inside.
OK. Well, that's it, everybody. OK?
what have you done with Juliet, our sensible, responsible manager?
the one who threatened to resign over the new owner's antics not so long ago.
I know, Tony, but we're over a barrel.
if there's anyone that can pull off something this insane, it's Sam.
please stop that insinuating squint.
couldn't we do something less risky, like, I don't know, rob a bank?
come on, Tony, I'm counting on you.
now, do me a favour and go and check on the Warrens.
what do you really think of this wedding fiasco?
well, at least it might distract me from my day of hell with the machete-wielding Kenneth Bingham.
Oh, morning, squire.
you're my trainee?
lovely little bistro you've got here, guv.
I bet there's no Spam on the menu.
Hey, have you seen my parents?
fraid not, madam. - Is that that fish kid?
I think the correct form of address is "shark girl."
whatever. She swims faster than I can walk on land.
I've eaten so many chocolates today. Where is the gym?
just through here, on the left.
thank you. - OK.
your shape's good, but you're snatching those breaths.
try to keep it smooth, OK? - Five minutes, Mand.
then we need to tighten those dropped elbows for the next take.
everything satisfactory, madam? - Alexis Warren, Mandy's mother.
we need some grass juice-- wheat and rye, no pampas.
and Mandy needs more towels. - Of course.
uh, Miss Warren, nice to meet you. - Hi.
if there's anything you need, please let me know.
maybe a magazine or some DVDs.
sure, if you tell me which... - Better not. Need to stay focused.
never mind. - OK.
didn't think we'd be planning a wedding together again.
we didn't plan anything. I planned it.
you were in Monaco buying racehorses, which later turned out to be dead.
still, it was a good party.
um, we need to sort out a bride and groom so that I can hire the outfits.
doesn't Emily knows some actors? - No, we can't risk this getting out.
we need to use people we know-- us.
no, not US us. Us, the team.
trust me, I'm sure I can convince them.
you know, I'm surprised you're backing me on this.
not as surprised as I am.
Oh, my God! Kenneth, Kenneth, Kenneth! Let me just...
Oh! - Right, right.
what next, mon capitaine?
go and lay tables in the restaurant.
do it sitting down, if you must.
at the double, sir. - Right.
that, out.
well, that glue sniffing has taken its toll on your trainee.
how old did you say he was? 16? 17?
Yes, very funny. I feel more like a home help.
you know, I actually have a list of the things he can't do.
it includes bending, lifting, chopping, cooking, scrubbing and handling machinery.
the only thing he can do, it seems, is recall, at will, the complete works of George Formby.
is that my grass?
Yes.
your youngster a cow, is she?
no, but her mother is.
shark girl herself is largely monosyllabic.
Ah! Teenagers. - Mmm.
Oh, blimey! - Ah, pensioners.
Oh, no!
butterfingers, I'm afraid, sarge.
no, just incapable fingers.
excuse me. - Well, carry on.
I wonder what the dress will be like. - Yes, I wonder.
so romantic - a European princess and a son of the 24th-wealthiest man in Britain getting married in the coolest hotel in London.
Mmm...
Er...pretend princess and her pretend lover and a pretend wedding, you mean.
Yeah, all right. Don't spoil my wedding buzz.
you two, such chemistry. What a team.
Ben, a model of old-world elegance.
Emily, so regal, so graceful, like a princess.
you two would make a great royal couple.
congratulations, Princess Marianne of Liechtenstein and Mr Henry DeWitt.
no. - Yes!
Ben, it has to be you. I can't risk this getting out.
look, Ben, just imagine it. It's your own special day, your bride a vision in flowing white silk.
a string quartet playing music just for you and white roses as far as the eye can see.
and unicorns. - And...
look, I know you can do it. It's going to be easy.
we're just gonna dress you up, take a few photos, it will be over in less than an hour.
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Ben, I'm counting on you. You're the only person I considered.
Well...if I'm your first choice.
fantastic. You two are gonna be great.
I'm getting married!
fancy a part in the wedding?
me? - I need a best man.
I've never been asked to do that before.
Oh. Well, thank the vicar, tell a dirty joke and shag a bridesmaid.
easy!
yeah? I need a favour. What are you doing?
it's cheap sparkling wine.
I bought it from a man with half a face in a car park.
it's cheaper than water. - Is it drinkable?
well, I usually use it for stains.
but I think it's OK. What's your favour?
Er...yeah. I need a father of the bride.
Oh, I'm very flattened that you come to me, but father of the bride, I don't think I can think of anyone suitable.
what, me?
Oh. Oh. Well, I'm very moved.
I'm not old enough, but I will do my best. You can count on me.
I know I can.
Sam, Emily's just taken a call from Fazio. He's on his way here with a photographer.
now? Today? - I'll sort out the Olympia Suite.
and then we need to prep our princess and her beau and tell everyone with a role to play to keep out of sight of Fazio.
OK. You get Ben, meet me in Juliet's office, five minutes.
please, please, what is my role?
a gorgeous bridesmaid, a sexy ring bearer?
actually, everyone's really busy, so I need you to man the front desk, and find a hundred wedding guests, people we can trust not to blab.
OK? Great.
your glass of green gloop, miss. - Thanks.
Hey, Mandy, sit down. Raise your foot.
you clumsy idiot. - I'm so sorry.
it's fine.
she's a swimmer, for God's sake. These feet are her livelihood.
it's not deep, thank God.
I'll phone the insurance people. - Dad, you really don't have to.
well, get a first aid kit! - Yes. Yes.
I thought you said all we had to do was get dressed up and pose for some pictures.
don't worry, we've made up back stories for you.
I am Princess Marianna of Liechtenstein and back home, I have five pet pigs who share my bed.
pugs. - Pugs.
you have five pet pugs. - Yeah.
and can we have a little more princess and a little less Nosferatu?
I need a wig. I'd feel so much better in a wig.
OK. We'll find you a wig.
I'm Scottish. - Half-Scottish.
so, do I have to have an accent too?
no.
just relax. You two are gonna be great.
OK.
that was Tanya. Fazio's here.
you would like maybe to take picture of a beautiful Croatian girl?
well, are you famous?
I once modelled for a popular weapons catalogue back home.
good morning, Signor Fazio.
Oh, it's a pleasure to see you again so soon, Ms Miller. Sam.
and, please, it's Gennaro. - Oh, Juliet.
you really do have a very impressive hotel.
I wish I'd known sooner. I would have made a reservation.
Oh, well, we could always make room for a special guest.
um, let me show you to the suite where we're doing the photo shoot.
Oh, you're having a party as well, Juliet?
Er...no, they're for a commercial that we're shooting downstairs.
first aid kit - Oh, we don't need that now.
the insurance bloke's on the way with a nurse.
we can't risk an infection. The ad's on hold.
dad, this is really silly.
maybe, Mand, but we can't afford to take any chances.
I know these ads are boring for you but they make everything else possible.
this man is going to take you to the gym and you can do some upper body work, - but no pressure on your foot, OK? - Fine.
Oh, and, er...try not to drop anything on her, hmm?
of course.
do you enjoy this kind of thing? The ad, I mean.
it pays a year's bills.
training, travel, hotels, Mum's and Dad's expenses.
Yeah, they're certainly very dedicated.
they gave up their jobs to support me, help me get my scholarship.
and did they used to swim? - Not exactly.
mum can't even swim.
my Grandma Lizzie took me to the lido every Saturday when I was a kid.
Oh, well, she must be very proud.
dunno.
her and Mum... had a row.
it's just through here.
I'm sure you know what's what.
um...I'll get you some towels.
OK, you're not actually gonna be doing all of that stuff, are you?
you're making me look bad. - Sorry.
I was joking. I should have brought my roller-skates from home, this would have made this a lot easier.
wait! How do I make this stop?
just turn it down. - Where?!
the minus button on the right. - Where on the...
pull the red key out. - Whoa!
Oh, my God!
are you all right?
I'm Jo. - Mandy.
nice to meet you. - Are you all right, madam?
what's going on? Who's this?
mum, this is Jo. - Hello.
please remove her. Mandy needs to be focused.
mum. - Look, I don't want any drama.
and, trust me, my ego needs some refined sugar.
nice mum, Mandy.
horrible girl.
Mandy, 30 minutes on the weights and then up to the room for an hour's sleep, all right?
I'm expecting a delivery this afternoon. I'll come and get it.
very good, madam.
Bye, darling.
just, er...let me know if there's anything else that you need.
OK. - Thanks.
have fun.
turn to me, please.
princess Marianne of Liechtenstein and Henry DeWitt.
don't they make a lovely couple?
I thought it was Princess Sylvie and Phillip De Beauvoir.
Oh, our PR girl made a mistake with the paperwork.
I'll rectify it for you. - Wonderful, Juliet.
I'm not sure I can handle this.
keep it together, Henry.
think of our unborn children.
OK. I think we need the money shot.
a kiss?
perfect. Bravo. That's a wrap.
well done. Well done.
thank you so much. You make a stunning couple.
thank you, Marianne and Henry. Thank you very much.
but one last thing
can I ask why you chose to marry here at Hotel Babylon?
well... it's where we first met.
that's a beautiful story. When was this?
three years ago... - Last year...
we first met here in the hotel three years ago, then we met last year at a party, and that is when we really fell in love.
it is a very special place for us.
are you OK? - Yeah.
that kiss... wasn't sick-making.
Oh. Thanks.
one last thing, Count Massimo of Umbria will be arriving tonight for the wedding.
excuse me? - He's a friend of mine and knows the princely house of Liechtenstein from long ago.
I took the liberty of inviting him.
please, you will show him the greatest courtesy.
of course, Gennaro.
until tomorrow.
she say, "Papa, you are the greatest man alive."
Gino... what do you know about being a best man?
Ah! Well, you need a very good funny story. Very naughty, pure filth.
well, dirty jokes aren't exactly my forte.
OK, could you, uh...
what? Come on, James, spit out.
could you tell me some? - Yes.
there's a priest, a whore and a donkey in bed.
the donkey, he look down and he say...
Hey, isn't that The Times restaurant critic?
I don't get it.
Oh, my God! Tristrum!
there you go, sir. - Thanks.
in those days, there weren't any fancy tranquillising guns, or anything like that.
if you wanted a beast knocked out, there was only one way...
Tristrum, how wonderful to see you. - Ah.
if I could just interject for one moment...
of course. - Kenneth, would you come with me, please?
thank you. Excuse us. - Er...yes.
why are you talking to the customers?
when I was a waiter in Tangiers in '55...
we're not in Tangiers in '55.
the modern dining experience is an art form
polite, efficient and, above all, unobtrusive.
Oh, just...just go into the kitchens, out of sight.
do whatever Chef tells you.
Kenneth! That way.
thank you.
will you look after Tristrum?
I need one limo for ten minutes.
it's a wedding, sort of. Yeah.
just has to pick 'em up round the corner and drop 'em off.
Thanks, Mick. I owe you one.
Mrs Alexis Warren - Waiter, more oysters. - Certainly, Mrs Warren.
Oi, nosy!
so, which room is Mandy the shark in?
she's the only person in this hotel that is not a thousand years old.
so you're at a bit of a loose end, are you?
it's just so boring having jet-setters for parents, not to mention having to travel the stupid world with them.
I burnt down the pool house and they think it's some kind of a cry for help, but it was just a really good party.
I'm sure it was. Could you do me a favour?
take these up to the Alexandra Suite on the third floor?
do I look like your carrying droid?
no.
but if you do, you might meet someone interesting up there.
Thanks, mate.
Hey. - Hi.
you are one elusive swimming superstar, let me tell you.
Oh, the hotel dude gave me this junk to bring up.
why don't you turn the telly on? I'll do us some ice-cream.
what's it like being famous?
I dunno, really. I just swim.
I kind of expected your room to be filled with little white, fluffy puppies and diamonds.
I don't know. - Bentleys!
well, come on, you do do this TV stuff.
how much do you get paid for it?
Um...60, 000, I think. - That's it?!
well, it's enough to pay for, you know, hotels and travel and stuff.
is it? - Isn't it?
it's costing my dad a few grand to stay here for just this week.
look, I dunno. My parents sort it all out. Why do you even care?
these are an ad fee right here. - They're my mum's.
I have totally got to become a swimming champion. It's easy, right?
Yeah. Once you've mastered the treadmill. - Oh, shut up!
Tanya... you're on count watch.
we cannot have this man staying at the hotel.
he's an Italian count and he knows the Liechtenstein royal family.
if you see him, you must tell me or Sam immediately.
OK.
no can do. It's a work-centred learning initiative.
it's voluntary. He can't be sacked. - He's a bloody liability.
I'm sorry, you're gonna have to deal with this one.
now, listen, if you see him, can you tell me or Sam?
Tony. - Mm, one sec.
er... can you give me a minute?
James, where's the Warrens? - They left a few moments ago. Why?
no, Mandy, that is not the point.
I don't care. - Listen to your mother.
mum, we weren't doing anything.
Er...Mrs Warren, sorry, actually, it was my fault.
I did ask Jo to bring your bags up.
but I told you that I would come and fetch them.
Yes, but I thought that they'd like a chat.
you know how teenage girls are. I have a teenage daughter myself.
what Mandy needs is for people to stop interfering so that she can concentrate on her performance.
now, both of you, out. - Mum, she's my friend.
Mandy, You've known her for about five minutes.
well, that's all the time I have because I'm always working.
we've talked this through a thousand times.
we all have to make sacrifices. Now, this is a busy month...
and I thought my mum was a bad-arse.
Yeah, she is a little demanding, isn't she?
you know Mandy's getting paid peanuts for this ad?
well, the shark equivalent of peanuts.
what would that be? - Sardines.
Oh, ha-ha, very funny.
Oh, my God!
what if they're ripping her off?
I mean, did you see those shoes in there? Those are rich people's shoes.
and, trust me, I would know. I'm rich.
let's not jump to any conclusions, eh, Jo?
look, put it this way.
never have I been so glad to have the parents that I have.
good evening.
I'm here for the wedding. - Wedding?
you must be mistaken, sir. There's no wedding here.
but this is the Hotel... er, er...what's-its-name, isn't it?
Oh. There are several Hotel what's-its-names, sir.
which one did you want? - The one with the royal wedding.
that's not us.
right. Well, perhaps I can speak with your manager?
a good idea.
what has he done now? Hold that.
can't you do anything right, you silly old fool?!
sort of a mistake, really. - A mistake?!
you are a bloody health hazard!
you shouldn't be at work.
you... you should be in a home!
Er...I understand...
uh! Uh! Uh! I don't want to hear another word.
if I could fire you, I would.
now, just...
go and sit in the corner.
we'll try and pretend you're not here.
um, Signor Fazio sends his apologies.
he was mistaken. The wedding's actually on this date next month.
Oh.
why did you not say that to me? - I did.
Oh! Well done. Good lad.
I'd offer you a room as an apology, but unfortunately, we're fully booked, so I'll have my concierge phone you a taxi to take you to another one.
I usually stay at the Hotel, um...
you know, the one with the doors and the unusual spoons.
Oh, yes, I know the one you mean. Yes. Well, please excuse us.
are you making a speech? - Eh...
I'm father of the bride tomorrow.
Oh, the wedding. - Exactly.
Oh, they grow up so quickly, it seems like only yesterday memory of napkins
well, I never see her in a napkin，it was an accident.
we look together, very good, huh?
well, looks like everything's under control.
Ah! Fazio!
gennaro. It seems we can't keep you away.
Ah, when you find a hotel you like, it seems crazy to stay anywhere else.
and besides, there's something about this place.
it's a pleasure to have you back.
I was hoping to book a room, if the offer still stands.
of course. Um, I'll show Gennaro to the Pyramid Suite.
keep him up there.
perhaps we could have dinner?
clear.
I see things are progressing in the way I pretty much predicted.
got time for a word? - Yes.
sorry. Fazio's back. - Oh, God! Where?
no, it's all right. Juliet's taken care of it.
what did you want?
I bumped into Helga in the canteen and she was sobbing her eyes out.
she'd accidentally set fire to a pan and didn't own up to it.
I thought I'd come and tell you, so you could smooth things over.
Oh, no. - James!
Tristrum. Back so soon?
Yes, I just dropped in to book a table. Eight o'clock all right?
for you, of course.
and I want to talk to you about your new waiter.
Tristrum, I know. I've moved him into the kitchens.
Oh.
I was rather hoping my wife would be able to meet him.
I can't remember the last time I went to a restaurant with a staff worth listening to beyond the plat du jour.
I'll make sure Kenneth is here.
see you in the morning, hubby dear.
bright and early.
so, what can I do for you, Tony?
I'd like to know how much we're getting for the Mandy Warren ad.
I realise it's confidential, but... - Ten and a half grand.
should have held out for 5%, but three and a half's not bad.
hmm. So, that makes her fee... - 300 grand.
what did you wanna know for?
Oh, it's just something I need to sort out.
Er...thank you. - No worries.
it's all right. Sit down.
Kenneth, I, um...
I owe you an apology.
I know now the fire wasn't your fault.
well, the poor girl was rushed off her feet and made a mistake, that's all.
but you didn't say anything, you just took it when I...
when I shouted at you.
the truth is, I saw a man in his...
twilight years and I thought...
I'm 74.
and I don't think you thought at all.
what you don't get, Mr Schofield, is that you need to pay respects to everyone, whatever their age, because that's what your restaurant is.
it's not the decor or the menu, it's not even the food - it's the people.
and, er... I like to refer to my years as "golden," not "twilight."
quite right.
would you take table orders this evening?
I would very much appreciate it if you'd say yes.
and, do you know, people have been asking for you.
Really? - Oh, yes.
and, Ken... - Yes?
just, um... just be yourself.
well, I always am.
and once we did a photo shoot with George Clooney, and the make-up girl, she was so overcome, she just fainted.
well, I don't entirely blame her. - But Brad...
now, there's a man with charm.
is there anyone you don't know?
I'm sorry, I don't mean to boast, but some of the things I've seen...
come on, Gennaro, give me the gossip.
OK.
let me show you something.
is that who I think it is? - In rehab, last week.
she's in a hospital bed. - Yes. Private clinic, by Lake Como.
my photographer pretended to be a patient to sneak in.
God.
I had no idea it was this bad. Are you going to print these?
why not? You think some junkie pop star deserves sympathy?
she's 19.
don't worry, Juliet. I'm not gonna print them.
sometimes the very best pictures are more valuable that way.
that's my favourite thing about this job.
when you have someone's future, like this, in your hand.
hiding something is easy.
it can be done in the blink of an eye, without a moment's thought.
but keeping something hidden is the hard part.
whatever lengths you go to...
whatever you try...
somebody somewhere will know what's really going on.
when Marianne was just a little girl, she got lost in the woods behind the castle.
I was so scared for her, because there were many wolves in the woods.
uh, Gino, it isn't a fairytale.
it's more dramatic.
how you getting on with the jokes?
actually, I've decided to replace your smut with a couple of dryly humourless recollections of our time together at Oxford.
I can't believe it. - Me neither.
God, I remember my wedding day.
the anticipation, the expectation, the butterflies.
it's really happening.
I mean, I'm actually getting married.
Emily... you do remember this is a fake wedding, don't you?
what? Yeah. Of course!
the fake wedding of my dreams.
Sam. - Mm-hm?
what's your favourite flavour of ice cream?
rum and raisin. - Rum and...really?
OK, whatever.
you're a rum and raisin man.
but say you had a tiny taste of a flavour you thought you didn't like.
pistachio. Ergh! - Right.
but you tried it, but you liked the tiny taste.
do you think that's possible? - No. I hate pistachio.
hypothetically.
well, hypothetically, yeah, sure.
but you know what I'd do?
I'd have the whole tub, just to make sure.
who is it?
it's Ben. - Oh. Come in.
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
don't be silly.
OK.
I, well...I... I just wanted to say... Oh!
good luck. - Aww.
good luck to you too.
OK, hubby.
um... Ben...
.you know your hands are on my...
Yes.
Why?
I'm sorry.
Um...well... break a leg, and all that.
see you at the altar.
so, did you find out if fish kid's parents are nicking her money?
Er...strictly speaking, this is my side of the desk.
Oh, come on.
so did you find out or not?
I don't really think it's any of our business, is it?
they're ripping her off, aren't they? Oh, my God!
I knew it.
she's like a modern-day Macaulay Culkin. We should do something.
now, Jo, we don't really have all the facts, all right?
wait there.
could you double-check the limo timings for me?
I don't want anything to go wrong today.
but it's not easy, especially after the meal I had.
Ken. - Oh. Excuse me.
duty calls.
James, you look very swish.
Oh. Thank you. I'm off to a wedding.
do you know, Ken, you really have become quite the draw here.
I was wondering, how would you like a permanent post?
once your trial's over, say, two shifts a week.
well, it's touching, but I can't.
what? - You see,
I'm on a month's placement next week.
a dry ski slope.
it's not you, guv, honestly. You are a good boss, not like the bloke I was working for in Kowloon.
Pete the Bastard, we called him.
Yeah, concierge. Oh, Mrs Warren.
can you please come to our suite?'
Yeah. OK. Well, I'm on my way up.
right.
so, what exactly have you been telling this girl?
Er...Mr and Mrs Warren, um, I haven't said anything to Jo at all.
I did express a concern, but I can only think there's been some breakdown in communication.
stop trying to wheedle your way out of it.
accept responsibility! You're pathetic!
I could only apologise if something I've said has been misconstrued.
are you trying to compensate for being so low down in the food chain by interfering in your guests' business?
fine. I've become aware that Mandy is in fact being paid five times more for this advert than she's been led to believe.
what? - Is there anything else?
is that true? - Listen, love, we...
tell me it's not true. - How dare you interfere like this?
I can't believe... you've been lying to me.
I earn that money. - It isn't like that.
darling, of course you earn that money. But you're only 16, you've got an awful lot on your plate, and that's why we take care of the money until you're older.
we'll talk about all this after we've finished filming the ad, OK?
no, I've had enough. I'm not doing this any more, any of it.
Mandy. - Let her cool off.
the ad people are waiting.
we'd better go downstairs, in case they walk out.
you'd better pray that you haven't messed this up for us.
Mandy...don't do anything silly.
just leave me alone.
maybe I should stay. She needs friends.
well, actually, I've got a better idea.
if I was to get you a limo and a driver, could you do me a favour?
that doesn't send quite the right message.
OK, everybody, five minutes.
Oh, my God! She looks beautiful!
Mwah. Great work.
everybody, I just wanted to say something.
I wanted to thank you all for standing by me on this.
Oh, that's OK. - And, er...good luck.
let's get wed.
sorry, I had a lot of stuff to take care of.
you look like my Uncle Francesco. - Man of the cloth, is he?
no, he's a transsexual.
Thanks. Are we all ready? - Yes. Positions.
ready, Princess Marianne?
Yes. I think this is the happiest day of my life.
Ah! Signorina Miller.
it seems you got the wrong end of the stick.
my friend Fazio confirmed that the wedding is today.
Er...yes.
Juliet, it's so unlike you to be so imprecise.
is this the young principessa?
well... um...
Oh, my dear girl...
you haven't changed a bit.
still the same five-year-old girl I remember paddling in my trout pond.
ja!
but you...
I don't remember you.
this is Princess Marianne's stepfather,
sir Gino Primarola.
Oh. It is a great privilege and honour, signore.
Ah! You must be the cousin of, um, um...what's-her-face. She's a lovely woman and...
Ah! You must be the chap who can't stand the shellfish.
Ah, bellissimo. It's wonderful to see you all.
and have a wonderful time, everybody, and give them hell.
take your seat. - Grazie. Thank you. Grazie.
your Highness, you look beautiful. Best of luck.
here we go.
what are you doing? Getting married or having a baby?
I really need to ask for a pay rise.
please be seated, one and all.
beloved, we have come together here today to celebrate the marriage of this man and this woman.
it is appointed for the wellbeing of human society, which can be stable and happy only where the marriage bond is honoured and upheld.
you seek to be joined in marriage...
I am requied to ask you .or any other person here if you know of any reason why you may not lawfully be married to one another - and, if so, to declare it now. - Wait.
what is going on? - Er...is there a problem, sir?
Signor Fazio, you are ruining my special day.
what is this?
H-Hey, you can't just...
who are you?
um... I'm, um... Well...
she's not a princess.
these people are not Eurotrash, they're just trash.
this whole thing is a fake. Come on.
Gennaro, let me explain. - No, I have my story.
not the one I thought I was getting, but this one is even better.
five-star hotel defrauds magazine. - Gennaro...
Signor Fazio.
you know, if you'd just told me this wasn't real, maybe we could have still done business, but you tried to cheat me, and nobody does this.
Signor Fazio, we made a mistake, but we can talk, we can explain...
Juliet, I'm not interested in explanations.
I want an offer, or I go to press.
what sort of offer? - You tell me.
how much is it worth to you to keep this story from running?
give me some time, I'll see what I can come up with.
I'll give you five minutes.
could someone please explain what is going on?
wedding off. She not virgin. We get anonymous tip.
actually, I had heard rumours about the footman and her.
or had I?
come back soon. - Oh, huh.
Mandy, wait!
Nan.
let's go inside. Thanks, Jo.
what the hell are you wearing? - Er... it's for charity.
thank you, Jo. You did really well.
thank you. At least I'm good for something.
Yes.
I'm not letting him print the story. We need to pay him off.
with what? - Good question.
Sam, last night he showed me these photos, someone famous in hospital in a really bad state.
he admitted he told his photographer to sneak in to get them.
And?
he said that sometimes photos are worth more if you don't print them.
he's blackmailing the person in the photos, forcing her to pay him to keep them out of the papers.
that's what he's trying to do to us. That's...that's what he does.
where are the photos? - They're in his room.
OK.
I'll get the others, search his room.
you stall Fazio, in your office, have a drink with him, bat your eyelashes, just keep him there.
I won't be long. - OK.
right, we're looking for a brown envelope full of photos.
OK, I'll check the suitcase. - I'm over here.
right. Where are you?
he won't be long, he's just seeing how much he can get his hands on.
I can't apologise enough, Signor Fazio. The real wedding was cancelled...
I'm not interested in apologies or explanations, Juliet.
I know. I'm...
I'm just so sorry, um...
especially on a personal level.
I'm not so sure I should believe you.
I've enjoyed your company very much, Gennaro, and it's just...today's events got in the way of...us.
and in different circumstances...
anything? - No.
James? - Huh? Nothing.
shit! They're not here. - I knew it.
we both felt it when we first met, when we bumped into each other.
am I that transparent? - No.
but...I can see you more clearly now.
and what do you see?
two people...with a mutual desire.
I can pull up the floorboard. - No, Tanya, thank you!
I think you need a drink, boss.
so we're just gonna give up? - What other choice do we have?
is the door locked? - Why?
because I know what we both want to do.
great. - What are we gonna do now?
and it cannot wait, Juliet.
this is another game, huh? Huh?
in another place, in another time,
I would just take what I want.
what is going on? Tell me!
tell me, you sneaky little bitch!
you sneaky little bitch! What is it? What is it?
get off! - Juliet? Get off her!
I'm OK. - What's going on?
by the time I've finished with you, no-one will come to this hotel...
now, then, Signor Fazio, about that deal.
You...where did you get those?
no, the question is, where did YOU get them?
did you have permission for these? - Permission? This is theft.
give me those back or I'll call the police.
go ahead. We can tell them how you broke into a private hospital to illegally take photos which you later used for extortion.
very well, then.
I won't print the wedding story, you have my word.
now give me the photos back.
no, I think that we'll hang onto them for insurance purposes, you know, just in case you change your mind.
you're... You...
I think the phrase you're looking for is "You haven't heard the last of this," or something similar.
are you OK?
they have to be a lot scarier than that to rattle me.
I'm sorry I was so long. - Thank you.
it's OK. It's OK.
mum. What are you doing here?
Simon, I know everything.
about the money, the lies.
you interfering old bag.
you always think that you know best. That's what this is about, isn't it?
Alexis, this is about Amanda.
you've always treated her like a commodity.
please!
I only wish I'd acted before you cut her out of my life.
I don't even know where my own granddaughter lives.
we decide how best to manage her affairs.
not any more. We've spoken to the lawyers and they've told me my options.
Mum...you can't.
it just means she takes control of her own finances.
Amanda's going to come and stay with me for a few days, cool off.
then we'll all sit down and talk.
Darling...try and understand.
we were trying... - You lied to me, Mum.
no. We were... - Yes.
Yes, we did.
we did... and we're sorry.
I'll be in touch.
Hey.
so, did you divorce the bastards?
I'll go and collect your bag.
not really, but...it's cool.
listen, you know you're not allowed to have parties...
Oh, God, please don't remind me.
I thought I might have one if you'll sort out the guests.
no way! You're joking, right?
I'm gonna throw you the party of the century.
I'll see you later, right? - Bye.
thanks for...everything. - You're more than welcome, madam.
I'll come back and show you my medal.
shark girl's gold medal. I look forward to seeing that.
Bye. - Good luck.
now, have you got everything?
Thanks, guv. - No, Ken, thank you.
and if you reconsider, let me know.
done. All the best, then.
you know, I must say, you've, um...
you've obviously had quite a life.
those stories of yours are something else.
Oh. I make 'em all up, guv.
Yeah, I fixed trams...
for 51 years. Never got out of the country.
it's all a bit dull, but, er...hey-ho.
see you, then. - Yeah, see you.
Oh, I see. Bringing out the good stuff.
I thought we'd celebrate our lucky escape.
go on, then, Tony, you can say it. I told you so.
well, why would I want to? All worked out in the end.
anyway, it's not about me.
all right, then. I told you so.
Ben. Ben, are you OK?
it's just that you've been a bit...
well, massively weird the last couple of days.
OK.
it's just that... you know when me and you...
Hey! ???
who... is that?
uh, Tanya's cousin, I think.
fantastic! - What?
Oh, nothing.
I think I've just realised I'm definitely a rum and raisin man.
Hey, everybody.
Gino, James, when are we gonna hear these speeches?
Yeah! - What?
it all start when me and my wife...
I was joking. - Oh!
hidden truths come in all shapes and sizes.
so, any ideas how we're gonna come up with 200-odd grand for this tax bill?
how about some more weddings? - That's not funny.
no, seriously, Emily's taken two bookings- a footballer and a soap star.
word's got out - people want a taste of Babylon's new-found royal glamour.
d'you remember our wedding night?
no, not that bit.
earlier, when you did the running man in your dress on the dance floor.
I think there's a video of it somewhere.
Sam, Fazio sent the prints we asked for.
but whatever you're trying to hide, whatever your secret is, 'remember, it won't stay hidden for ever.'
Hey, isn't this... - To Henry and Marianne!
you know, It's our anniversary today?
we're not married any more.
this is Isabel, our new receptionist.
Hi. Isabel? Mel. Isabel.
who are you?
nobody mentioned that it would be open.
Gino, the body's gone.
I don't suppose you want to...
grab a bottle of tequila and take it up to my suite?
Juliet, look at you - amazing!
what's going on? What the hell are you doing with my husband?
[Cheering and Shouting] On your right, on your right.
back, back, back.
back, back, back, back
watch the winger!
[muffled] You ok? Dan, Dan, talk to me. Dan, Dan, get a doctor!
1X02: PATERNITY Original Airdate on FOX: November 23, 2004
Hey!
close the door. Close the door!
is Cuddy down the hall counting to 50?
she's knows I'm in here, the clinic, as she commanded;
she just doesn't know I'm alone.
well, you've got a full waiting room, how long do you think you can ignore them?
I'm off at 4: 00.
you're doing this to avoid 5 minutes of work?
I go out there, I get assigned a kid with a runny nose.
that's 30 seconds looking at the nose;
25 minutes talking to a worried mom who won't leave until she sure it's not meningitis or a tumor.
Yes, concerned parents can be so annoying.
just tell Cuddy you've got an urgent case, you had to leave early.
that would be lying.
and that would be wrong. But luckily, the definition of urgent is fungible.
not the definition of case though.
you have no cases?
you have NO cases?
you've got hand picked doctors, specialists, working for you, and they're sitting on their hands?
cameron is answering my mail.
time well spent I'm sure. Foreman and Chase?
research?
9 letters, iodine deficiency in children.
Cretinism.
so, 4: 03 PM. Dr. House checks out. Please write that down.
Dr. House.
sorry, done for the day. There's plenty of docs here to take care of you.
but we had an appointment.
hah, nice try, but this is a walk in clinic, which means there are no appointments.
it means you walk in, sign the chart and a doctor will see you, just not me.
but your letter says that we would see you.
not a big letter writer.
here.
when did my signature get so girly?
I can explain.
see that "G," see how it makes a big loop on top?
it doesn't even look like my handwriting.
think I have something?
what's the differential diagnosis for writing "G"s like a junior high school girl?
it's impossible to get to you through normal channels, they have called...
perseverance does not equal worthiness. Next time you want to get my attention wear something fun.
Low-rider jeans are hot.
16 year old male, sudden onset of double vision and night terrors, with no apparent cause.
the kid's been to 2 neurologists
night terrors, yeah? As in big scary monsters?
Yes.
where are you going?
to see the family.
you're going to examine a patient?
9 times out of 10 there's no reason to talk to a patient, but night terrors in a 16 year old is a VERY good reason to talk to this family.
good work.
margins look fine.
no lesions, color is good.
how long have you been having night terrors?
three weeks.
he's afraid to go to bed, he's exhausted, he can barely function.
what does that tell you?
nothing, it's just fun watching him blink.
name as many animals that begin with the letter "B," go.
baby elephant.
baby elephant is actually a good answer; "B" is a bear of a letter.
what does that tell you?
proves two things, no neurological damage, and your son is never going to be chief fry cook.
in teens there are two likely causes of night terrors:
post traumatic stress, any recent shootouts at your high school?
no.
well, then, Dave, if there's no trauma, the other cause is sexual abuse.
so, who's molesting you?
teacher, extra friendly neighbor?
I'd ask if either one of you were involved, but you'd deny it.
we would never do anything to hurt Dan.
I say it here, it comes out there.
this lack of response is consistent with abuse.
there's no one, ok? I swear.
there was trauma; I got hit in the head during a lacrosse game.
did you know that he got hit in the head?
they didn't mention it, no.
Yeah, why bother.
no, no, we took him to the E.R. after the game.
he was scanned, they tested him, they said he was fine.
no concussion, it's gotta be something else.
you hound me for my opinion and then question my diagnosis.
cool. E.R. obviously screwed up, kid's got a concussion.
I had double vision before I got hit.
well, that changes everything, you need glasses.
that's why you had double vision, which is why you got hit, which is why you have a concussion, which is why you have night terrors.
you need to see an ophthalmologist, which I am not.
you enjoyed that.
I brought a reasonable case to your attention, and you shoved it in my face just to humiliate me.
you're an only child, aren't you?
why would you say that?
everything is about you.
this may seem incredibly controversial, but I think sexual abuse is bad.
I just wanted to make sure he wasn't being diddled by daddy, or mommy, anything else is just a bonus.
I'm not an only child.
interesting.
what?
don't move.
did I bore you in there?
what? Ah, no, not, not really. - Are you tired?
sometimes.
he never sleeps! Of course he's tired.
right now, at this moment, are you tired? - No, no.
that twitch in your leg. Did you feel that?
didn't hurt.
his leg twitched. I don't see what...
it's called a myoclonic jerk, it's very common when you're falling asleep.
respiration rate falls, and the brain interprets this as the body dying, so it sends a pulse to wake it up.
so?
so, he's not asleep, he's awake.
admit him.
I recognize that loopy "G."
so, what does the jerk tell us?
nothing good, the brain's losing control of the body.
can't order the eyes to focus, regulate sleep patterns or control muscles.
a movement disorder, or degenerative brain disease.
either way this kid's gonna be picking up his diploma in diapers and a wheelchair.
maybe not that bad, could be an infection.
you wish. No fever, no white count.
anyone think this differential diagnosis might be compromised because we don't have an accurate family history?
I took an accurate family history.
you didn't even take an accurate family.
his father's not his father.
why would you say that?
30% of all dads out there don't realize they're raising someone else's kid.
from what I've read false paternity is more like 10%.
that's what our mom's would like us to believe.
who cares? If he got it from his parents they'd both be dead by now, can we get on with the differential diagnosis?
$50 bucks says I'm right.
I'll take your money.
hit a nerve? Don't worry, Foreman. I'm sure the guy who tucked you in at night was your daddy.
make it $100.
what about leucoencephalopathy? In a 16 year old.
it doesn't necessarily have to be that bad.
if we exclude the night terrors it could be something systemic: his liver, kidneys, something outside the brain.
Yes, feel free to exclude any symptom if it makes your job easier.
the night terrors were anecdotal. He could have had a bad dream.
no, parents said he was conscious during the event and didn't remember anything afterwards.
that's a night terror.
parents said?
that's a good point.
before we condemn this kid, maybe we should entertain Dr. Chase's skepticism.
I want a detailed polysomnograph.
if he's having night terrors I want to see them.
I usually don't move during night terrors.
I'm not restraining you for them.
eeg revealed abnormalities in your brain caused by nerve damage in your toes.
what are you doing?
fixing it.
can I talk to my parents?
Oh, they know all about this.
I'd really like to see them.
please! I'd really like them here.
this is gonna hurt, Dan.
Oh, God!
that's a night terror.
we did a CT, MRI, CBC, Chem-7 and chest x-ray.
all the tests came back normal. There's nothing to explain his symptoms.
OK, but let's pretend there's something and go from there.
who sees something on this MRI?
no lesions, no white matter.
no structural abnormalities.
no space-occupying tumors.
he's 16, so he should have an absolutely pristine brain.
the smallest thing is abnormal.
meningeal enhancement. My bet is viral meningitis.
excellent, you see what he did there?
he took a small clue that there's a neurological problem and wasn't afraid to run with it.
there's no evidence of meningitis on that MRI.
no, there's not, he completely wrong.
then what clue are you talking about?
he knew that I saw something on the MRI so he figured there must be something there and took a guess.
clever, but also pathetic.
so, what did you find?
take a close look at the corpus callosum.
it looks ok.
are we all looking at the same thing?
200 million interhemispheric nerve fibers, the George Washington Bridge between the left and right side of the brain.
it's subtle.
there's some bowing, there. An upward arch.
are you guessing?
Yes.
too bad, you're right.
he probably just moved, nobody stays perfectly still for their entire MRI.
Yeah, he probably got restless and shifted one hemisphere of his brain to a more comfortable position.
something is pushing on it.
if there's bowing it could be a tumor.
do you see a tumor on this MRI?
no, but I don't see any bowing, either.
there's no tumor, just a blockage causing pressure, causing symptoms.
today night terrors, tomorrow he's bleeding out of his eyes.
get him a radionucleotide cisternogram. I guarantee you'll see a blockage.
OK... all right easy...
now, I'm injecting a material that's tagged with a radioactive isotope.
it's gonna enter your spine and travel up to your brain.
it'll make you able to think deep thoughts, at about 100 miles per hour.
easy.
their eyes aren't the same color, but that fleck in the eyes...
that's maybe a one in ten chance if they're not related?
Nah, House isn't gonna pay you based on that.
[Chuckles] Any excuse we can give the folks to justify a DNA test?
we could tell them he's got Huntington's.
the whole family should be tested or they'll all die.
Hey, there's a lot of blockage.
I've scheduled him for surgery.
we're gonna put a shunt into one of the ventricles to give the cerebrospinal fluid an out.
no more pressure, everything goes back to normal.
he's lucky to have you as his doctors.
no formula, just mommy's healthy natural breast milk.
yummy.
her whole face just got swollen like this overnight.
Mmhmm. No fever, glands normal, missing her vaccination dates.
we're not vaccinating.
think they don't work?
I think some multinational pharmaceutical company wants me to think they work.
pad their bottom line.
Mmmm. May I?
sure.
all natural no dies. That's a good business: all-natural children's toys.
those toy companies, they don't arbitrarily mark up their frogs.
they don't lie about how much they spend in research and development.
the worst a toy company can be accused of is making a really boring frog.
you know another really good business?
teeny tiny baby coffins.
you can get them in frog green or fire-engine red.
really. The antibodies in yummy mummy only protect the kid for 6 months, which is why these companies think they can gouge you.
they think that you'll spend whatever they ask to keep your kid alive.
want to change things? Prove them wrong.
a few hundred parents like you decide they'd rather let their kid die then cough up 40 bucks for a vaccination, believe me, prices will drop REALLY fast.
tell me what she has.
a cold.
there's a problem.
complications in surgery?
surgery went fine, he's in recovery, but we took a vial of CSF and tested it.
Really?
turns out the bowing wasn't the cause of his problems, it was a symptom.
Oligoclonal bands, and an increase of intrathecal IGG.
which means multiple sclerosis.
and the reason it takes three of you to tell me this?
because we're having a disagreement about whether or not it is MS.
no lesions on the MRI.
it's early; he's had the disease for maybe two weeks.
mcdonald criteria requires six months to make a definitive diagnosis.
Oh, who cares about McPherson? I hear he tortured kittens.
McDonald.
Oh, McDonald. Wonderful doctor, loved kittens.
the VEP indicates slowing of the brain.
without the lesions we can't be sure.
well if it is, it's gone from 0 to 60 in three weeks, which would indicate rapidly progressive MS.
we should wait until we
start treating him now, he can walk for another couple of years, maybe live for another 5.
break it to the family. I'm going home.
it'll take months for a definitive diagnosis.
what'll happen to me?
ms is an incredibly variable disease, if it is MS, and we're not 100% sure.
what do you think is gonna happen?
there are some medications to manage the symptoms, but as the disease progresses the problems will become more severe:
bowel and bladder dysfunction, loss of cognitive function, pain.
it's gonna hurt?
the brain's like a big jumble of wires.
ms strips them of the insulation, and the nerves die.
the brain interprets it as pain, but by starting treatment we're gonna avoid that for as long as possible.
we're looking into a couple specialists, and until we get you squared away you'll stay here.
security checked the videotapes for all the perimeter cameras;
he's still gotta be in the hospital.
Where's Chase?
main floor.
OK, you take the cafeteria and administration.
I'll hit the research annex and work my way back to you.
I'm not here. Leave a message.
Dr. Cuddy, great outfit.
what are you doing back here? Patient?
no, hooker. Went to my office instead of my home.
Dr. House, Dan's missing.
Yeah, I got that part from the message. You said I was needed immediately.
he shouldn't move after a lumbar puncture.
I agree, he's gonna have a very nasty headache.
that would also be my opinion if consulted tomorrow morning.
we wanted to keep you informed.
he heard some pretty heavy news.
this is not a toddler wandering around a department store.
he's 16. You'll find him. I'm going home.
so, when you say "Call me if you need anything," You mean, "Don't call me."
no, I mean "Call me if I can do something."
I'm bad at search parties and I'm bad at sitting around looking nervous doing nothing.
what about his parents? Should we call them?
Why? You think they're hiding him?
make sure someone checks the roof;
some of the orderlies keep the door propped open so they can grab a smoke.
Dan? You ok?
there are experimental treatments, ongoing research...
who knows what they'll discover in a year or two?
this is where I dropped the ball.
Dan, we're standing on the roof of the hospital!
Dan! Dan, you're not on the field!
he doesn't know where he is.
Dr. Foreman.
I assume you found the kid.
he almost walked off the roof.
suicidal?
no, he thought he was on his lacrosse field.
look, look, I was just gonna run home, shower, change...
conscious?
Yeah.
how'd you talk him down?
actually, Chase tackled him.
how come you didn't do it?
right, well, I am black, but he was closer.
come on, you can ride up with me.
anybody tell the family that their boy almost stepped off a roof? They must be thrilled.
they're not suing, but I think only because Chase asked them.
why does everyone always think I'm being sarcastic?
this is great news! He doesn't have MS.
the parents should be thrilled, well, the mom anyway.
of course, the dad probably doesn't know
why doesn't he have MS?
he was on the roof thinking he was on the lacrosse field, conscious, and therefore not a night terror. You want some of this?
Yeah, sure.
he was in an acute confusional state, which doesn't fit with a demyelinating disease like MS.
the Oligoclonal bands.
were real. They just mean something other than MS.
so, what are they telling us?
that the immune system is working.
right, he has an infection in his brain.
what about sex?
well, it might get complicated.
we work together.
I am older, certainly, but maybe you like that.
I meant maybe he has neurosyphilis.
heh, nice cover.
sorry, RPR was negative.
we don't need a definitive test to confirm this.
sure, didn't need one to confirm MS.
OK, let's wait for you to run titers on 4000 viruses while this kid's brain turns to mush.
so the fact that he doesn't have MS is, it's really not good news after all?
well, it is. If it's neurosyphilis, the likelihood of a false negative on an RPR test, 30%, the likelihood of a 16 year old having sex, roughly 120%.
I'll start him on IV penicillin.
we're not going to wait for that.
the most effective way to deliver the drug is right into his brain via the spine.
we can't. In a cramped space like the brain, increased intracranial pressure from a high volume drug like penicillin could herniate his brain stem and kill him.
no neurologist in his right mind would recommend that.
show of hands. Who thinks I'm not in my right mind?
and who thinks I forget this fairly basic neurological fact?
who thinks there's a third option?
very good, what's the third choice?
no idea, you just asked if I thought there was one.
[Sighs] The patient has a shunt in his brain.
there'll be no increased pressure, we can put as much penicillin into his body as we want.
excellent, inject him through a lumbar puncture.
one of us is going to do this to you twice a day for the next two weeks.
he could get syphilis even if he's not sexually active?
well, it's unusual, but it's possible.
relax.
Geesh.
it's infected, with a really big hole like you stuck a nail in it to relieve the pressure.
I wouldn't do that.
although the wound is irregular, not cylindrical, it's shaped like a triangle, so not a nail.
steak knife?
wife's nail file.
nail File.
Yeah, pain'll make you do stupid things.
something to take the edge off?
Yeah.
Cheers.
so, do you have family here in Princeton?
no.
here on work?
no, why are you
does your penis hurt?
no. What? Should it?
no, just thought I'd toss you a really inappropriate question.
your lawyer's gonna love it.
why would I want to sue you? I want you to treat me.
you're from Maplewood, New Jersey. Right?
Yeah.
now, why would you drive 70 miles to get treatment for a condition that a 9 year old could diagnose?
it's the free flowing puss that's the tip off.
I was in town.
not for family, not for work.
you drove 70 miles to a walk-in-clinic. You passed two hospitals on the road.
now, either you have a problem with those hospitals, or they have a problem with you.
my guess is that you've sued half the doctors in Maplewood, and the rest are now refusing to treat you.
it's ironic, isn't it?
it's like the boy who sued wolf.
you know what? I bet we have a doctor here named Wolfe.
how perfect would that be?
I'm gonna page him.
OK, you know what? Thank you, I'm gonna find a doctor to take care of this.
I didn't say I wouldn't treat you.
we'll drain your knee, run some lab work, fix you right up.
why would you do that?
I'm a people person.
you actually treated him?
all I know is that he sued some doctors, who am I to assume that they didn't have it coming to them.
the cutest little tennis outfit, my God I thought I was going to have a heart attack.
Oh my, I didn't see you there, that is so embarrassing.
how's your hooker doing?
Oh, sweet of you to ask, funny story, she was going to be a hospital administrator, but hated having to screw people like that.
I heard you found her on the roof.
you have very acute hearing.
you notify the parents?
in due course, of course.
and is there a paternity bet on the father of the patient?
doesn't sound like me.
well, it does actually, but that doesn't mean you're guilty.
you think?
I saw the parents in the lobby, smart money is obviously on the father.
my guy knows a guy who can get you in for $50 bucks.
fine. You tell your guy if I win, you attend the faculty symposium and you wear a tie.
and if I win, no clinic hours for a week.
my guy will call your guy.
she's very good at her job.
the treatments should start helping soon.
let us know if it gets easier to focus on things, remember stuff.
Hey, Dan, isn't Dr. Cameron's necklace a beauty?
something South American, I think.
Yeah, Guatemalan.
it's a cool necklace.
thank you so much.
the kid's in pain.
don't fight it. - Just let it happen.
no.
no, what? - You'll be dead in three days.
I give it a day.
Dan? You ok?
he's hearing voices.
come on! Dan!
get OUT OF MY HEAD!
auditory hallucination shows further brain degeneration.
penicillin's not working.
so, either it's a bad batch of penicillin, or our diagnosis is wrong.
square one. "Midnight."
l. F. T.s, B. U. N. , and creatinine, are all normal, diabetes is out. No gap.
there goes metabolic.
MRI rules out vasculitis.
I" for inflammation.
to young for anything degenerative.
"d," see ya. "N" for neoplastic?
MRI was clean.
I" for inflammation.
we already did that.
stupid to have two I's in one mneumonic.
what's the other one?
infection.
Oligoclonal bands still have to mean something.
but no fevers; white count's elevated but within range.
and we've tested for anything remotely possible.
everything is negative.
ct scan rules out subdural.
trauma, later much.
you know the problem?
midnight is actually spelled with a "G" and an "H."
if we could just figure out what those two letters stand for.
it's a sick brain, having fun, torturing him, talking to him.
scaring the hell out of him.
get him an EEG, left and right EOG, esophageal microphones.
if this thing wants to talk, let's listen.
we're missing something.
this is screwed up.
that's why you came up with the brain talking to the virus thing?
I panicked, ok?
sounded cool though, they bought it.
Oh, crap.
another reason I don't like meeting patients.
if they don't know that you look like they can't yell at you.
here we go.
how can you just sit there?
if I eat standing up, I spill.
our son is dying, and you could care less?
we're going through hell; you're doing nothing?
I'm sorry, you need to vent, I understand.
don't be condescending.
you haven't checked in on him once.
blood pressure's 110/70, the shunt is patent well placed in the right lateral ventricle, the EKG shows a normal QRS with deep wave inversions throughout both limb and pericardial leads.
LFTs are elevated but only twice the normal range.
Oh yeah, and he's hearing voices.
go hold his hand.
go on; I'll bus your tray.
got any sample bags on you?
I don't believe you. You're gonna run DNA tests?
their son is deathly ill, I know it's terrible, but the fact is if I don't keep busy with trivial things like this I'm afraid I might start to cry.
you're an ass.
yeah? You want to double the bet?
general Hospital is on channel 6.
Dan's brain's not showing channel 6 right now, only mush.
no epileptiform activity.
what are you doing?
waiting for CBC and Chem-7.
good, run DNA on these.
what's this?
parents' coffee cups.
I can't believe you
I've had this conversation once already.
if you've got something else to do, do it. Otherwise, do this.
Dr. House?
Hey, Mr. Funsten!
I was wondering when you'd be back.
got some papers for me?
you've caused me considerable mental distress.
I certainly hope so.
what? Too cheap to have your lawyer serve it for you, or is it more fun this way?
I'm obviously prepared to consider a settlement.
you have gonorrhea.
no, I don't!
well, maybe you're right, but I have a lab result that says you do.
it could be a false positive; normally I'd run a second test, but since you're here I'll just go with the first.
you're just trying to scare me.
it's reportable you know, public health issue.
I'll be sure to let my wife know.
Oh, don't bother yourself, the state will call for you.
look, if you're clean I'm sure this will all blow over, no big deal.
there's an easy way to find out, get one of your doctors run a test.
these are mine now.
I'll see you in court.
west Nile negative, not surprising, since not too many mosquitoes passing through Jersey in December.
no Eastern Equine Encephalitis.
you guys aren't going to believe this.
what's that?
house was right, the father's not the father.
[Sighs] Dude doubled up on me.
you're not gonna believe this, the mother's not the mother either.
it's not a good idea to move your son in his condition.
we just want a second opinion.
we need an answer.
you idiots!
you lied to me!
we didn't lie about anything.
you, on the other hand, accused us of molesting our son.
perfect.
can we get off my screw-ups and focus on theirs?
theirs is bigger. You're not Dan's parents.
we're his parents.
he was adopted. He doesn't need to know.
I do.
adoption makes him just as much as
listen, when we were taking his medical history, were you confused?
did you think we were looking for a genetic clue to his condition, or did you think we were trying to ascertain who loves him the most in the whole wide world?
how did you find out about this?
I sampled their DNA.
we didn't give you any DNA.
your coffee cups from the cafeteria.
you can't do that!
again, why are we getting hung up on what I did?
your medical history is useless.
no, we gave you a detailed history of his biological mother.
her history;
non-smoker, good health, low cholesterol, no blood pressure problems.
Dan was adopted two weeks after he was born. You have his history.
there's nothing you need to know that we didn't tell you.
sounds reasonable.
well, if you want to transfer your boy that is your choice, but I still think it's the wrong
was she vaccinated?
the biological mother, when she was a baby, did she get her vaccinations?
Dan was vaccinated at 6 months.
Mm hmm, and do you know why kids get vaccinated at 6 months?
because before that, they are protected by their biological mother's immune system.
so, was she vaccinated?
an infant picks up a regular old measles virus.
he gets a rash, he's extremely uncomfortable, has a wicked fever, but he lives.
here's the kicker, once every million or so times, the virus mutates.
instead of Dan having a fever and a rash the virus travels to his brain and hides like a time bomb.
in this case for 16 years.
subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis.
I know. There's only been 20 cases in the United States in the past 30 years.
I suppose you could make an argument that the kid's still in stage one.
once SSPE moves to stage two
boom, stage two is universally fatal.
I assume it's impossible to tell when he might move into stage two.
he's already started showing symptoms. It could be a month, it could be tonight.
can we treat it?
ask the neurologist.
intraventricular interferon.
we're not gonna shove a spike into his brain and drip interferon without confirming this diagnosis.
we won't get a reliable result for measles antibodies in his CSF, not after everything we've given him.
why do people lie to me?
it could also kill him.
your ball, Foreman, tell me I don't have to biopsy his brain.
well, there is one other way.
you sure this isn't gonna hurt?
Yeah, it's just scary as hell.
see, we go through the pupil.
you won't feel it; the eye's been paralyzed.
the needle travels to the back of the eye which is where we perform the biopsy on your retina.
so we've confirmed that the problem is this mutated virus.
the treatment for SSPE is intra-ventricular interferon.
we implant an Ommaya reservoir under the scalp, which is connected to a ventricular catheter that delivers the antiviral directly to the left hemisphere
look, you want us to consent to this?
I don't even understand what you're talking about.
well, the antiviral
look, I'm sorry,
I can explain this as best I can, but the notion that you're gonna fully understand your son's treatment and make an informed decision, is, it's kinda insane.
now, here's what you need to know, it's dangerous, it could kill him, you should do it.
you can't order a $3, 200 DNA test to win a bet.
it's not an actual cost.
I don't know if you know this, but the hospital actually owns the sequencing machine.
I'm serious.
well, tell the parents to submit the bill to insurance.
insurance is not going to pay for a bet.
it should. If we don't make that bet, the kid dies.
if not for the paternity bet, I never would have taken their DNA, without their DNA we never would have discovered that Dan was adopted, which was the key to this case.
you just don't want to pay your end.
big mistake. My guy knows a guy.
fine. I will let you out of clinic duty for one week, after you pay the $3, 200 for the PCR test.
Whoo.
well now, there's the $100 you owe me, there's the $100 I won from Cameron, $200 I took off of Foreman, and $600 I got from Wilson.
very bitter.
Hey, good morning.
good news on your EEG, treatment is working.
and your immune system is responding.
I know it's early, but let me take a look.
let's see what that brain of yours can do.
name as many animals as you can that start with the letter "O."
ostrich, ox, old elephant.
well, that's 2 better then last time.
how you doing with the whole adoption thing?
I knew since 5th grade.
how's that?
cleft chin.
I have one, my dad doesn't.
I looked it up on the Internet; it's one of those trait things.
that's right, it's autosomal dominant.
since neither of your parents have cleft chins, it's highly unlikely that you're biologically related.
you sure you're ok?
I've got no problems with being adopted.
I love my parents.
how's he doing?
he's doing pretty well.
he's a smart kid.
I think he's gonna be fine.
Thanks.
wheels, one-eight! Wheels!
we will anger the Americans, slipping out like this.
if your son was a student at one of the greatest universities in the world...
so make him come to you.
you're protected near the N.
once we cross 42nd street... -As always, I appreciate your caution, joseph, but, as always, you have far too much of it.
stay down, sir.
get on the ground.
get on the ground.
I'm just serving process.
your boss is being sued under title 18 of the united states code, section 1350, for genocide, crimes against humanity, and torture.
Mr. President.
this is only a civil lawsuit.
we can ignore it.
Mr. President.
you want us to work for Foreman?
not permanently.
he is setting up interviews to replace Taub and Thirteen, but it might take a couple of weeks.
what happened to them?
he quit, and I had to let her go.
you actually fired your girlfriend?
Yes.
you two are both competent, and I know I can work with you.
you really do know how to woo.
I need you.
it would be interesting.
we could work together.
did you see who the patient is?
that's one of the reasons it'll be interesting.
Dibala is one of the most repressive dictators of the world.
you had no problem treating a guy on death row.
who was still in prison after we patched him up.
we fix Dibala, he gets on a plane and executes half his country.
he's been repressing an ethnic rebellion in the south, the Sitibi people.
it's getting worse.
Dibala is a guest of the U. S. Government.
and he's been invited to speak at the U. N.
I'm not asking you to love him.
I'm asking you to do your job.
possibly incomprehensible
of course, I'm talkg about you firing your girlfriend.
we weren't getting along with her working under me.
this'll help.
cameron and I work together.
but you weren't her boss.
and you stopped working together.
why don't you just tell her you were wrong?
cause I wasn't.
I know how this looks.
I know it might break us up.
but that's better than definitely breaking us up, which is what would have happened otherwise.
hemorrhagic ulcers in the lungs.
Oh, my god, it's three years ago.
does that mean I'm still crazy?
you're back?
you look good.
we're just helping out because... -I know.
I just ran into Thirteen while she was clearing out her locker.
my condolences.
although it's not like she's the hottest woman in the world. -We haven't broken up.
are you back?
sort of.
did you get your license back?
not for a month or so.
so you'll be in charge.
I'm just gonna pitch in a little.
Dibala thinks it was an assassination attempt.
polonium, like the russian guy in Lon..
FBI checked the service of process forms and his hotel room.
no radioactivity trails.
acid reflux?
no history of asthma or heartburn.
he has a bug bite on his hands.
malaria's endemic in his country.
let's start him on coartem.
I don't want to step on any toes, but I guess I do have higher duty to the patient.
if you have something to say, say it.
you're rushing to a diagnosis because you're rushing out of this room because you're rightly upset with me.
although I wasn't the one who made that asinine decision.
do you have anything medical to say?
poison fits better because of the vomiting.
bug bite might not be a bite.
it might be the start of chloracne.
assassination attempt through dioxin poisoning.
it's hard to detect.
fit.
start him on olestra.
you couldn't have just said dioxin up front?
I was hoping you'd get there on your own.
so I guess we should talk to Cuddy.
you are sure it is dioxin?
no.
it's our best guess.
the olestra here binds to the poison and flushes it out of your system.
where are you from, doctor?
I'm Australian.
do I hear a bit of the British?
most people don't notice it.
Yeah, I kicked around there for a while.
you went to medical school there?
actually a year of seminary.
and you left.
there was a catholic mission near my childhood village.
I liked the priests.
they were good people.
but when my two younger sisters were dying from consumption, it wasn't more priests we wanted.
I fired my girlfriend because he said he was gone for good.
I need this in my life.
a week ago, it was the last thing you needed.
it's a process.
I'm learning.
and screwing me over as you go.
Yeah, that's why I did it.
sorry.
if you want, I'll explain it to Thirteen.
he's not ready.
he doesn't have his license.
then he can't practice.
