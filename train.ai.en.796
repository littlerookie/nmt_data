and he has "a plan" in the works.
something that will benefit the both of us.
what plan?
I don't know. He didn't say.
he just said to be patient.
mm, I can relate to that.
I'm kind of going through the same thing right now.
with Jack? - Yeah.
you know, this whole thing with Philadelphia.
I don't know how that's gonna play out.
you're worried that he's gonna go back there?
of course.
and even if he doesn't, What's the next thing that'll come along
and take him away at a moment's notice?
the not-Knowing...
it's not fun.
no, it isn't.
did Seth say where he was?
no. - Well, at least you know he's safe.
part of me wonders if it's all even worth it.
Hello?
Hi, Stan.
Yeah, she's right here.
meet you where?
right now?
Hey! - You bought a boat?
that's just like the one we used to have.
come on board and we'll go for a little spin.
I don't think so.
Oh, come on! You loved our boat.
you did, too. - Yeah, we all did.
come on. Just a quick ride out to the point.
it could be fun.
I don't know, you guys.
come on, mom.
one little spin.
Oh, alright.
Justine, can you get the lines?
there we go.
okay, let's see what this baby can do.
can I help you? - Yes.
Hi. I'm Maryellen Sherman.
we spoke on the phone awhile back.
lady, I talk to about 50 people on the phone every day.
right. Of course.
I called you about one of your former chefs, John Bowman.
Yeah.
I asked you why you fired him, You said he lied on his application.
that's right.
but you wouldn't tell me what he lied about. You said "ask John.
and did you? - Yes.
but he wouldn't tell me either.
Yeah, that figures.
tough break. Excuse me.
look.
the reason I called...
I'm opening up a restaurant in Cedar Cove
and I'm thinking about hiring John. He's an incredible chef.
Yeah, he is.
best I've ever worked with.
then why did you fire him?
what did he lie about?
?????
please.
I've put every cent I have into this place.
I need to know if there's anything I should be worried about with this guy.
one of the questions on our job application asks If you've ever been convicted of a felony.
he answered "no.
he was in prison?
Yeah.
for what? - That's all I know.
I'm sorry.
and he didn't even tell you where he was going?
no. - That's not like Seth,
to disappear without saying anything.
well, whatever he's up to,
I just hope just he realizes what he's putting you through.
sorry. Listen to me... Like I should be giving anybody relationship advice.
Hey, you remember when we used to come out here And skip stones?
it was a tournament of champions.
jordan always had us beat.
he got up to seven.
I think it was eight.
come on, dad. Let's see what you've got.
Oh... alright.
alright. Let's see what you got.
I got to find a good one.
that's alright. - That was not a good one.
two! - Two.
get a nice flat one!
there. Take that one there. - There's a good one.
okay, from the side.
good one, Jordan. - Thanks, dad.
good job, Jordan.
you alright?
it's so nice to be out here again. Isn't it?
it is.
I should've never left.
it was the single biggest mistake of my life.
I missed you.
we'd better go.
I drove down to Tacoma.
Why?
I went to the fire water grill.
is it true?
were you really in prison?
Yes.
Why?
it was a drug charge.
what happened?
it doesn't matter.
it happened.
why didn't you tell me? - Because it's not something I'm proud of. Okay?
I don't walk around bragging about a thing like that.
I still deserve to know.
what else have you been keeping from me?
nothing. - Because I need to know if there's anything else You're not telling me.
I'm sorry. I really am sorry. - John...
I can't be here right now.
you can't just walk out in the middle of your shift!
wow...
I'm impressed.
it's gorgeous!
Yeah, it's getting there, isn't it?
Hey.
I stopped by your place earlier.
something I wanted to tell you in person.
Yeah, I had some things I had to do.
I just wanted to tell you that, uh...
they did offer me that job.
full-time sportswriter, covering the Phillies.
full-time?
I turned it down.
what?
Jack... that's your dream job.
Yeah, it is.
what can I say? I, uh...
I like Cedar Cove better.
you know? The, uh...
the fresh air, the clean water...
mostly the people.
certain people in particular.
hey... you're not the only person Who can turn down a dream job, you know.
I can't believe you did that.
ain't she a beauty?
she certainly is.
Yeah, Jack's come a long way Since that picture frame he made you.
I love that picture frame.
Yeah, but to make a canoe By hand...
that's some gesture.
Yeah, Bob. I think she gets it.
well, um, I'll get out of your way.
Hey, listen. Uh...
something you wanted to talk about?
you seemed a little anxious.
no, I... I wanted to ask about the job.
I'll call you later. - Okay.
Warren! What are you doing here?
Ah, it's my daily run. Same as you.
you don't run. - I do now.
it's my attempt to de- Stress after work.
is it working? - Surprisingly, no.
I just feel sweaty all the time.
but it is part of my new outlook.
how about you?
I run here every day. You know that.
so what are you saying? That I came here, Hoping to run into you?
no, it's just a huge coincidence. - It could be!
look. I'm trying to make Some real changes here, Justine.
you know? Live a healthier life, Be a better person.
those are some real ambitious goals.
I wish you luck with that.
starting with running.
now, you don't mind If I tag along with you, do you?
not a problem. As long as you think you can keep up.
are you serious? Come on.
I ran track in high school!
key words there being "high school.
Oh, no. No. Don't go that fast.
okay...
what kind of drug charge?
he wouldn't tell me.
he just walked off the job, right in the middle of his shift.
he quit? - I don't know.
well, it's probably for the best.
God only knows what other secrets He's keeping from you.
honey, it's gonna be okay.
I just...
I wish he would've told me.
that's what bothers me the most.
well, sometimes, people like that
find it hard to talk about that sort of thing.
that's just it.
I don't think he is "like that.
I look at his art, I look into his eyes...
John's no criminal.
I'm just saying I think there's more to this.
there has to be some kind of explanation.
more secrets. Terrific.
you just be careful, Maryellen. - I will.
don't worry about me.
I have to. It's my job.
Hey, Olivia!
W... you want to meet right... right now?
so, what's this big news you wanted to tell me about?
Stan's leaving Melanie.
what? - They're getting a divorce
and he's moving back here.
here? As in Cedar Cove-Here?
and how do you feel about that?
well, I'm happy for Justine...
Yeah, but it isn't exactly ideal To be sharing a zip code with your ex-Husband.
he took us out to the point.
we were out on the beach, skipping stones,
and, for a minute there, I was back in time,
and it was all so perfect.
he told me that he regretted leaving me,and that he missed me.
okay, wait a minute. So he's coming back here for you?
he wants to get back with you? - I don't know! I don't know!
well, what does Jack say about all this? - I haven't told him yet.
why not?
well, he gave up that big job To stay here with me.
I know, I need to tell him Before somebody else does.
your business finally brings you close to home,
and I've hardly seen you.
I've been so busy.
you know you're my favorite girl.
Mr. Big-Shot. Always so wrapped up in your work.
it's time you took over that company entirely.
why don't you call up the ceo and tell him to resign?
you know what? I'll do that.
Shh... The judge is deliberating.
what? - What's with you?
Stan's moving back to Cedar Cove.
the ex-Husband returns.
way to cramp your style, huh?
that's not it.
you really don't mind that Stan's moving back here?
I don't know how I feel.
back up! Do not make a sound.
Hey! Look who's here.
what are you doing? - Making him squirm.
hi there! - Hello, ladies!
Hi, sweetheart.
Hello, Will.
grace. I haven't seen you around.
well, I've been avoiding you.
she's just kidding.
funny.
so, how's dinner?
will's headed home in a few days,
so I've been spending as much time as I can with him.
really. Why so soon?
I have to head back to Atlanta. - Ah. Back to your wife.
that is where she lives.
and I hear you have this fabulous trip Planned together.
pardon? - Mm-Hmm, yeah, Olivia told me all about it.
France! How charming.
why don't you join us? - Sure!
Oh, no, thanks, we can't stay.
we can't? - We need to drop off that thing?
that's right, too. We do have that thing to drop off.
well, you all enjoy yourselves now.
mom, you can't be playing games like this.
trust me, it's not a game.
thank you for meeting me.
I don't know what to call you.
Mrs. Bowman? Mrs. Kirkland?
Donna.
please.
can I get you anything?
Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine.
I was so glad you emailed me.
does Daniel... I mean, John... know?
no. He'd probably be very angry If he found out.
he is your son, right?
Yes.
but he hasn't spoken to me or his father in years.
I learned he spent time in prison.
a drug charge?
what happened?
may I ask first what your relationship is with him?
honestly, I...
I don't know.
we've dated a few times.
I like him a lot. He's a...
a wonderful artist and chef, but...
I can't live with all the secrecy.
he won't tell me anything.
John spent five years in jail.
what kind of drug charge was it?
was he dealing?
Oh, no. No, no. He...
John had an older brother, Jim.
straight "A" student.
class president.
he and John were pulled over for speeding, And Jim...
was carrying drugs,
and he hid them under the front seat.
the cops found them?
because it was John's car, He was the one who was arrested.
he pleaded with the cops, told them the drugs weren't his, But...
no one believed him.
no one? Not even you?
his... his father and I, we... - Why didn't Jim tell the truth?
he let his brother go to jail?
John was four months from completing his sentence when Jim...
died of a heroin overdose.
and that's when we learned the truth.
John hasn't spoken to us since.
we've been looking for him, Trying to reach out to him.
we knew he changed his name,
and now he's probably gone again.
and who knows if I'll find him this time.
no...
Oh, come on! No!
again?
what?
what are you, stalking me now?
I told you this already, this is my daily run.
that's why I left earlier today.
Justine, come on. You didn't have fun with me last time?
I even let you beat me.
you let me? - Yeah!
alright, fine. Look.
if you don't want company,
just say the word, and I'll leave you alone.
I don't want company.
Where's Seth been, anyway? I haven't seen him around lately.
alright, if you're gonna insist on Running with me, - Can you at least keep quiet? - I will.
Absolutely. Under one condition.
we ease the pace a little bit. I'm more of a slow-And-Steady kind of guy.
slow and steady? - Yeah, we do that, I promise you,
I'll stay quiet.
Oh! Come on. No.
why did I not see that one coming?
okay.
I'm only doing this once!
cause I will never be able to get out of bed after this!
Hey, Jack.
Hey.
what happened here?
Oh, just re-Enacting the Titanic.
Oh. Sorry to hear that.
Yeah.
well, back to the drawing board, I guess.
Hey! Uh...
is that your boat?
Yeah. Just bought it.
Ah.
so, what, You're just gonna keep it here While you visit Justine?
Olivia didn't tell you?
tell me what?
I'm moving back.
my wife and I separated.
so you're coming back here?
well, I want to be closer to Justine. - You know what? Don't give me that.
alright? Just don't.
you came back here for Olivia.
no, Jack. But, listen...
no, no. You listen to me.
look, Stan, it's time for you to man up, alright?
admit that you still have feelings Olivia.
it's more complicated than that. - Yeah, you bet it is.
because she's with me. - I know that,
and I'm trying to be respectful.
you're not trying to be respectful! You're here!
look, why don't you just admit it? You want her back, don't you?
come on, Stan! Just say it!
I want her back.
exactly.
so what are we supposed to do about this?
well, I don't think it's for you or I to decide.
is it?
Yeah. You're right.
thanks for the water.
my pleasure.
I always come prepared.
how are you feeling, anyway?
actually, better.
better than ever.
and by "better," I mean incredibly sore.
what is that?
it's aspirin.
like I said, I always come prepared.
turning my life around, Justine,
and I have you to thank for that.
Warren, I... - No, no. Hear me out. Seriously. I mean it.
if it wasn't for you and your father, I don't know what would've happened.
I just want to say
how thankful I am that you were there for me.
I just wish there was someone out there Looking out for you, too.
Warren, don't start. - What? I'm not starting anything.
I'm just... I don't know.
I'm just thinking about this guy, Seth.
I mean, what guy
walks out on such an amazing woman like you?
I mean, it's ridiculous. - He didn't walk out on me.
Oh, okay. He didn't? Well, I'm sorry. I stand corrected.
look, Warren, what we had... - Is in the past. I know.
and I'm okay with that.
look, I'm just looking for a running buddy, okay?
is that too much to ask?
I should get going.
W... I can drive you home.
no, thanks.
same time tomorrow?
if you can find me.
why didn't you tell me that Stan was moving back here?
I should have.
you told him that you were okay with that?
him living here?
he wants to be close to Justine.
you know, I am so sick of him playing that card with you.
what are you talking about?
he's back here for you, Olivia.
don't do this. - No, no. Listen to me.
he told me himself that he still has feelings for you.
do you still have feelings for him?
he's the father of my children.
that's not the question I'm asking, And you know it.
look, you two clearly have things to work out.
I should have realized that the first time
I saw you two together in your kitchen.
you're right.
Stan and I share a lot of the same memories.
some of them are sweet
and some of them are so horrible they cut me to my core.
he wants to make up for walking out on us.
he wants a chance to talk about the pain that we lived through.
no. He doesn't want your forgiveness.
No! He wants you, Olivia!
he thinks that he can just rewind everything
and pick up where he left off.
well, that's not what I want.
but do you know that?
I mean, do you know how you're gonna feel for sure?
listen, for years, you've been waiting For him to come back here and resolve things with you.
well, guess what? Now he's here.
God, I just feel so stupid.
I am the first man that you have had a serious relationship with Since your divorce...
that's why he's back.
he felt you slipping away.
Jack, you know how much I care about you.
I know with my whole heart
that you're the woman for me,
but I'm not gonna play this game.
it's not fair, And I can't win.
Jack! - No, no. I am not doing this.
he was so angry and hurt.
I don't blame him.
he let his guard down, we both did,
and he gave up that incredible job to stay here with me.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that anything is going to change.
well, Stan moving back certainly complicates things.
your life is with Jack now. You... you can't keep...
will! What are you doing here?
I was looking for you, actually.
called your office, and they said... - No, you weren't. You were looking for me.
your brother's been calling and texting me, Olivia.
grace... - I'm not lying to her anymore.
What're you talking about?
will you tell her, or should I? - Tell me what?
go ahead, tell her. Tell her how you're leaving your wife, Will.
what? Is that true?
no. I didn't say that I was leaving her...
are you kidding me?
you told me that repeatedly!
I think she may have misinterpreted a few things.
misinterpreted?
just like when you kissed me? Did I misinterpret that?
you kissed her? - It was a stupid mistake after one too many glasses of wi...
I told you that, Grace. I apologized.
Yes, you did, you did apologize,
right before you said you wanted to see me again.
look, Olivia, it's complicated.
complicated?
what are you talking about?
I just talked to Georgia.
if you're thinking of leaving her, She has no idea.
how could you do this? She was a Saint,
taking you back the last time you pulled something like this.
it's not like that! - Just get out of here!
I don't even want to look at you.
he told me he was having trouble with his marriage.
all I wanted to do was be there for him, To console him,
but he kissed me.
grace. He's married.
he said it was over. - And you believed him?
well, I wasn't sure, I got confused.
well, you've always had a thing for him.
he kissed me!
and how hard did you try to stop him?
I pushed him away!
he's been the one doing all the calling and the texting.
this is gonna kill Georgia. How could you do this to me?
I didn't do anything to you,
and I understand that you are upset about a lot of things,
but don't you put all of this on me.
Yes, I'm upset,
but the one thing I thought I could count on Was my best friend not going behind my back And lying to me.
John, come on, I know you're in there!
open up.
can I come in?
What're you doing? You're leaving?
I told the landlord I'd be gone by the end of the week.
Why?
because of me?
I know how this goes.
the word gets around that I was in prison,
and then the job disappears, the friends disappear.
well, thanks a lot for assuming I'd be like everyone else.
so you don't mind that I spent time behind bars?
no.
that's exactly what my last girlfriend said.
then, a week later, she dumped me.
because of that?
or because you're a secretive person Who won't let anyone into your life?
I know what happened, John.
I know about your brother, and...
I know your real name is Daniel.
she came by the gallery again?
your mother?
no. I contacted her this time.
I... I would've preferred to talk to you,
but you walked out on me last time.
she's sorry about what happened, John,
about everything...
you should leave now.
is this how you want to spend the rest of your life?
running away and hiding?
being angry at your family? At the world?
I don't care about what happened to you before.
I want to be a part of your life now.
and if you want to be a part of mine, Then stop running.
and no more secrets.
there you are.
I have nothing more to say to you.
you have every right to be mad at me.
I couldn't have handled that worse.
I'm trying to apologize! - Apologize to your wife.
please, just let me explain. - Leave me alone.
not until you listen! - Hey. Hey!
you heard the lady. Leave her alone.
this isn't your business.
grace? - Stay out of it!
I'm so sorry you had to get involved in that.
you shouldn't be treated that way.
you are a true gentleman. You always were.
cliff, wait!
I have been acting like a complete idiot lately,
starting with that whole mess with the bachelor auction,
bailing on our date, And then this ridiculous notion that...
you don't have to explain yourself. - Yes, I do!
I want to make it up to you. - Really, not necessary.
please?
I really enjoy your company,
and would like it very much
if we could just have dinner sometime together.
I don't think so, Grace.
what just happened back there,
I walked in on a moment like that with my ex-Wife.
your ex-Wife? - I don't like to talk about it,
but she messed around on me,
and I don't want to ever go through that again.
I'm really sorry, Grace.
it's me again. I just talked to the harbor master,
and he told me that you sold your boat.
why would you do that?
call me back.
Seth, where are you?
horseback rides on the beach call Cliff Harting 555-0132 for more information and bookings, pairs or individuals
please tell me it's over.
it is. I swear.
please don't be mad at me.
it was never about you.
are you still mad at me?
you're my best friend.
we can't stay mad at each other. It's in the rules.
my brother's a jerk.
he always was.
I know.
Jack's gone
and I don't know if he's coming back.
I'm sorry.
me too.
u. S. Airways flight 72 to Philadelphia
is now boarding at gate A-33.
he's the father of my children.
that's not the question I'm asking, and you know it.
we're buying the restaurant together.
in good faith, I'm gonna give you the keys...Now.
bought a hat.
I'm gonna sign up for riding lessons.
stay out of it!
Cheers.
you can't keep running away.
I care about you so much that I want to keep you safe.
the only way I can do that is if I keep you out of my life.
don't you have anyone to help you out when the baby's born?
I'm giving it up for adoption.
Eric's gonna have a baby.
he's probably really scared.
I really missed you. -- I missed you, too.
you started that fire.
guys, what fire?
you burned down our restaurant!
I love you, Olivia Lockhart.
I love you, Jack Griffith.
how is she? How's Shelly?
how's the baby?
what's going on?
Eric, just give her a chance to tell us.
she had a mild seizure, but she and the baby are both doing fine.
what caused the seizure?
she has a condition called pre-eclampsia.
it causes spikes in the blood pressure, and it can cause seizures, but she has responded favorably to the medication we've given her.
we're going to continue to monitor her vitals, and, hopefully, she'll go into labor all on her own.
but if she doesn't?
she's healthy, and the baby is not in any distress.
but if there are any complications, for her safety and for the safety of the baby,I may need to perform a caesarean.
the important thing is Shelly is in the right place to get the care that both she and her baby need.
okay. Um, when... when can I see her?
please, Doctor. I have to see her.
someone will take you back shortly.
thank you, Doctor.
thank you.
thank you.
he won't let me in.
it's like we take two steps forward and then it's three steps back.
well, he's upset and he's scared.
well, now, you see, that's when you would think you would go to your father, right?
well, give him some time and space.
I am so glad you're here.
and I'm not going anywhere.
I pushed my whole docket back to tomorrow.
I'm all yours.
thank you.
God, I hate hospitals.
they're not my favorite place either.
I haven't been here in a long time.
Yeah.
a really long time.
Oh, sorry.
Where'd you go?
nowhere. I'm right here.
great. I'm fine.
okay.
Yeah. Would you be able to bring the prints by sometime next week?
okay. Great. Yeah.
Yeah, Tuesday works. Tuesday works perfectly.
fantastic. Yeah.
they just do so well in the gallery, so if we could get more of them, that would be great.
I'll be right with you.
fantastic. Alright. Well, we'll see you then.
okay. Have a good one. Bye.
hello.
we're, uh, we're looking for a friend of ours.
I'm the only one here.
our friend's an artist.
Oh?
so you... you know him?
he's one of our best-selling artists.
nice.
he left Cedar Cove.
any idea where he ended up?
um, no, I'm... I'm not sure.
I wouldn't have left you.
not without a pretty good reason.
John is one of many local artists.
if you're looking for photographs, I have... -- We need John.
uh, John's work.
how did you say you know John?
I didn't say.
I'm sorry I can't help you.
good luck, though.
Yeah.
you know, maybe we'll...
maybe we'll just stick around, you know, in case... in case John comes back.
but you have yourself a good day...
how do you know my name?
well, you told us.
no, I didn't.
am I reading this right?
Yes.
all charges?
Yes, Your Honor.
perhaps the prosecution would like to take some more time to consider their options.
your Honor, we've made our decision.
we have no choice but to withdraw our complaint against Mr. Saget.
well, then, Mr. Saget, I suggest you go buy yourself a lottery ticket, because today's your lucky day.
don't smile.
Mr. Saget is hereby released from custody and his bond vacated.
you are free to go.
it was sweet of you to come by.
it's the least I could do.
I dropped grandma off at the airport.
thank you for doing that.
no problem.
told her that you were at the hospital with Shelly.
she's sorry that she had to go.
well, she planned this cruise three months ago.
she couldn't let Barbara down.
I still can't believe that mom's going on a singles cruise.
grandma?
indeed.
so you don't need anything?
I'm all set.
as soon as Shelly's out of the woods, I'm headed home.
mom, are you sure you're okay?
I mean, I know when the last time you were in this hospital was.
I'm a little freaked out and I was 13 when Jordan died.
are you alright?
mom, I'm asking about you.
you're always taking care of everyone else, including me, so I just thought that maybe, I don't know, you need someone to talk to, so, I'm here.
I'm fine.
okay. Well, I would keep you company, but Seth and I have got to meet a contractor at the restaurant.
can you and Seth afford that?
the town was great to help us out, but we've got some serious damage.
if we want to get in there as soon as possible, then we've got to bring in a professional.
but the sale hasn't closed, right?
we never got that far.
we didn't even have an official deal.
I could kick myself for taking those keys and going in there to fix things before it was actually ours.
give yourself a break.
you were excited.
warren shouldn't have let you.
warren was looking out for Warren, which is always what he's done best.
okay. Bye.
you are so lucky.
I am?
you with Justine.
it's just so... nice and easy.
Yes, it is but we've had our problems.
no. No, me and Eric, we have problems.
you and Justine, you two, you have a real relationship.
be patient. You'll get there.
but first, you have got to let go of all this guilt that you're holding on to and accept that all parents make mistakes.
you're human.
give yourself some credit.
well, no promises.
break it up, guys. This is a hospital.
okay, so I have half of moon's bakery case,
I have some magazines, and I have a very large ball of yarn.
the yarn is for me.
in other words, I came prepared to stay for as long as you need me.
grace Sherman, report for duty.
thank you, Grace.
come here, you.
you guys. Aw.
so, can I give you a lift?
Yeah, sure. -- To the ferry would be nice.
cedar cove?
Yeah.
just do me a favor and do your job, make sure the Feds hold up their end of the deal.
Yeah, they will.
they really want to nail your business associates back east.
and what about me?
continue to cooperate and you'll be fine.
good.
here you go.
are you kidding?
Yeah, I think you have a few too many zeros there.
well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but that's just an estimate.
total cost is likely to be much more.
these old buildings, once we get in there, start pulling back the walls, exposing the plumbing and the wiring, it can get ugly.
we don't want to change the plumbing and the wiring.
well, that's not your choice.
see, a job this big's gonna require permits.
permits mean that, once I start, some inspector's gonna have to come in and sign off on the whole building.
and the roof.
now, look, your insurance will cover the bulk of the bill.
it'll be fine. You'll see.
excuse me.
can I see Shelly now?
actually...
what?
she's asking to speak to Judge Lockhart.
she knows I'm down here?
she does, but she just wants Judge Lockhart.
I'll see what she wants and then we'll get you up there.
I spoke to the doctor and she said everything looks good for both you and the baby.
I know.
really, Shelly, everything's gonna be okay.
no. It's not.
Eric wants to see you.
I can't see him.
what's wrong, honey? I thought you two were back together.
we were, but...
I think I've changed my mind.
we should put up the baby for adoption.
what do you mean?
I don't think we should keep our baby.
when things get tough, Eric takes off, and...
there are going to be a lot of tough days and tough years in raising this baby, and I know that I am not capable of doing this alone.
true, but, sometimes, you have to give people a second chance.
Eric's here now and he seems sincere.
Oh, the way he looks at you.
Yes, I love him, and yes, I want to keep our baby.
and I want to believe that he won't let me down again, but I just don't know.
I remember being in this same hospital, about to give birth, and, suddenly, the "what ifs" of being pregnant are replaced by the "what is" of having a baby.
it's real and it's happening, and it's okay to be scared.
but this decision is not one you want to make under this kind of stress.
I'm gonna give you some time to rest, and then I'll come back and check on you.
what if I decide that I want to give the baby up?
as I told you, and I am good to my word, I will help you, no matter what your decision is.
but Eric does have rights, and you're gonna have to get him to give up those rights if you decide to give away the baby.
I will talk to him.
I can't right now.
I know I should, but I... I can't.
can you stay for a while?
I don't want to be alone.
of course.
dad, I got to see her.
no, I don't think that that's...
there might be something wrong with her they're not telling us.
if that were the case, then why would she ask to see Olivia? Hmm?
come on. Why don't you and I, we go get some air?
I... I can't leave Shelly.
Olivia is with her.
let them talk. Alright? Come on.
let's go for a walk.
and I'll let you know if anything changes, okay?
okay. Thank you.
dad. -- Yeah?
I think Shelly wants to give up the baby again.
what?
well, she knows I'm out here, and she wants to talk to Olivia.
well, she said that Olivia was helping her with the adoption before I came back to Cedar Cove.
I'm the idiot that put that idea in her head in the first place.
this is all my fault.
I gotta talk to her.
I gotta straighten this out.
no, listen.
Eric, Shelly has been through a lot.
okay? You don't know why she doesn't want to see you, and it doesn't help you to be out here just imagining the worst-case scenario.
the thing is, right now, all I can think about is worst-case scenarios.
so Jack just took Eric outside.
well, that's good, because Shelly is not ready to talk to him.
Yeah, well, I saw him, and I'm telling you, there's no way you're gonna be able to stop him from going in there.
I'm not trying to stop him. I'm just trying to delay him.
both you and I know what it's like to be in a hospital, about to give birth.
it is not the best time to be making big life decisions.
can I ask you a favor? -- Sure.
my boyfriend's out there... He really wants to talk to you.
I'm not ready to see him.
got it.
thank you. I'll tell him "doctor's orders."
miss Sherman?
Oh, hi. You called earlier.
Yeah. I have several pieces by John Bowman, but he's only ever done two...
two portraits.
Yeah.
Hey.
you're the other portrait.
Yeah.
Hello?
yeah... yes. Sorry.
I'll have it ready for you this afternoon.
perfect. Thank you.
Olivia! What's going on?
Shelly's resting.
well, I don't care. I have to see her.
no, Eric, she just needs her rest.
why won't she see me?
it's not that she...
what did she say to you?
does she want to give up our baby?
she's scared and upset. Just give her some space.
so she does want to give our baby up for adoption.
Eric, listen to Olivia.
no. No. I am done listening and waiting.
sorry, you can't go in there.
Yes, I can.
Shelly's doctor left orders that she not be disturbed.
I think it's best you let Shelly rest.
dad?
well, Olivia makes a good point, okay?
and if it's doctor's orders...
Thanks, dad.
thanks for nothing. -- Eric.
we gotta do it. We got to hire him.
it's the only way we're gonna be able to get everything done.
we have no more money.
we'll figure something out.
that estimate is more than my first car.
and it's just an estimate.
we can do this.
once we get the restaurant up and running, we'll be able to pay it all back.
how? By printing our own money in the basement?
that's a brilliant idea.
so you're saying you want to hire the contractor and finish the sale?
don't you?
I just think that we have an out.
I mean, if we want it.
what?
look, I talked to my mom, and in the eyes of the law, the restaurant isn't ours yet, but if we go through escrow, then we own it, and all of the problems that go with it.
we put everything we own into the renovation.
I mean, the only way I see out of it is through it.
don't forget why we did this, it was so we could finally be together, you and me.
I know.
it's gonna be alright. You'll see.
Hello!
fancy meeting you guys here, huh?
aren't you supposed to be in jail?
huh. Well, it's nice to see you, too, Justine.
how did you get out?
well, innocent men don't belong in jail...
you're hardly innocent.
how's your wife? -- She's not my wife, actually.
she's my girlfriend.
or was.
anyway, look, I think my personal life stopped being any of your concern the moment you gave me that ring back, right?
alright, look.
I was just gonna swing by and check out the damage in the restaurant myself.
you two are okay, though, right? I mean, you had insurance?
you know that we weren't insured.
right.
I'm sorry. I totally forgot.
I guess it means, legally, I still own building.
which also means I'm gonna get a huge paycheck from my insurance company.
Seth, don't.
Yes, Seth.
don't.
wouldn't want me to call the police now, would you?
so I assume you still want to continue?
buying the restaurant?
no one's gonna stop us from opening that place.
no one.
I guess that means you still want to go through with it?
Absolutely.
well, that's great news.
Seth, it's fantastic.
why don't you do me a favor and get your financials all set, swing by my office, and we'll close the deal. Okay?
Justine.
we'll be okay.
Hey.
there you are. I was looking for you.
is Shelly okay?
she's fine. No signs of labor.
I sent Eric to the cafeteria to get something to eat.
grace is there, in case something happens.
I'm worried about you.
Yeah, I'm kind of worried about myself.
Eric?
Yeah.
you know, every time I think I'm making progress with him, it's just... right back where I started, and you know? I deserve it.
I was such a horrible father.
maybe you weren't always the father you are today, but you have worked hard to overcome your past and start fresh.
Eric doesn't know what he's doing or saying.
you have to stop this.
you have to be strong.
he needs you.
that may be.
but he doesn't want me.
so you found the place okay?
Oh, yeah.
thanks for meeting me on such short notice.
how's your mom?
she's great, Roy. Thanks for asking.
she said you used to work with the Seattle Police Department?
now I am a private investigator.
I think my, uh...friend John Bowman is in trouble.
the photographer?
I saw his work...at last year's artwalk. Talented guy.
he is.
so what kind of trouble has he gotten himself into?
that's what I'm hoping you can tell me.
two men came into the gallery today, looking for John.
they said they were friends of his, but I don't buy it.
before they drove away, I wrote down their license plate number.
those men scared me, and now I'm scared for John.
I'll look into it.
Thanks.
and, um, Roy?
please...
no police. Okay?
okay.
is that your son?
handsome.
and smart.
what's his name?
he looks so happy.
he does, doesn't he?
fresh from the cafeteria!
I think the green stuff is lettuce.
I'm not hungry.
too bad. You need to eat.
thank you.
so... how are you?
well...
Jack keeps blaming himself for his and Eric's relationship problems, and I'm worried about Shelly...
I didn't ask you that.
how are you?
I'm fine.
Oh, you liar, liar, pants on fire.
grace? Really?
liar, liar?
well, quit dodging the question.
and the question is?
I find it impossible to be inside this hospital and not think about Jordan.
I don't want to talk about the day Jordan died.
I am here to help Shelly.
got it.
thank you so much for being here for me.
I don't know what I would do without you.
now...
go home.
what? -- Go home. Go home. Go home.
fine. I'll go.
but I'll be back.
well, you don't have to.
just try and stop me.
let me walk you to your car.
I say skip lunch and go straight to dessert.
Mm! It would be cruel for me to have to share this with the guests.
the guests are gonna have chocolate cake.
well, I don't like cake.
which is why I made you this.
you going to tell me what's going on, or do we have to keep talking about this pie?
I'm sorry.
I'm just worried.
Shelly?
I just called her at the hospital.
she sounds so frightened.
look, I've got an idea.
why don't we just let this pie cool, and you and I take a nice, relaxing drive to the hospital?
you think?
I don't want to intrude, though.
Shelly's practically family.
no.
she is family.
which is why we're gonna go see her.
thyme and tide.
Hello?
okay, have a nice day.
Jack, what's going on?
are you okay?
what are you doing here?
we need to talk.
I'm gonna go check on Shelly and Olivia, so I'm gonna leave you guys to talk, huh?
I shouldn't have called. I, uh...
I'm your sponsor.
you most definitely should have called.
that's my commitment to you and your sobriety.
was it this hard your first year?
it was hard my first year, my second year.
it's hard today.
one day at a time, right?
you want to talk about it?
no.
but you want a drink?
Yes.
I'm better now. I, uh...
I'm not gonna drink.
I'm not.
okay.
you're just going to sit here with me?
Yup.
no talking?
Nope.
please don't do this.
my mind is made up. -- You're gonna raise along?
no.
you would rather have strangers raise our daughter?
Yes. -- Come on, Shelly.
Eric, you're here now, and you're committed, just like when I found out I was pregnant, but then you got scared and you felt pressured, and you bolted.
why can't you see that I've changed?
well, what happens if you haven't changed?
what's your back-up plan?
you just gonna leave the baby with your father?
I would never do that.
you know what my childhood was like.
my mom barely there, my dad took off.
if I wasn't going into a foster home, we were moving.
there was barely enough money to pay for the basics.
remember, you were the one who wanted to give up the baby in the first place.
I didn't know what I was saying.
no, I think it's what you wanted, but then you came back to Cedar Cove, and you saw me and you saw the sonogram, and you let your emotions run away with you.
I did, too.
please be reasonable.
I am going to do what's best for our baby, and I hope you'll go along with it.
please, Eric, don't fight me on this.
in the kitchen.
Ooh. Look at you.
how's everything going at the hospital?
Ugh. Complicated. -- I cooked.
I can see that.
it's nice to smell something other than hospital food.
family recipe.
only made for those who are very special.
that's really good.
I can't believe you can cook.
well, you're a cowboy and you don't, you starve.
not a lot of takeout on the open range.
you hungry?
Hey. Cliff made stew.
honey, what's the matter?
it's John.
I think he's in trouble.
I'm sorry.
you know what? I think I'm gonna head on back to the ranch.
I am so sorry.
no, no. Somebody needs you more than I do.
you are so...
I am, aren't I?
I'm a lucky lady.
I'm the lucky one.
mom.
I'm in here.
is Shelly alright?
I don't know. That's not why I'm here.
what are you doing here?
Oh, my docket's doubled for tomorrow.
I had to pick up these files to prep.
Warren's back in town.
impossible.
I just saw him.
he's here, walking around free.
how did Warren Saget get out of federal custody?
I have no idea.
are you alright?
great.
it looks like Seth and I are going through with buying the restaurant, although I have no idea how.
Really? I thought that was still up in the air.
warren started poking us about finishing the sale of the restaurant...
is that what you want?
mom, Seth gave up what he loves to be here, so that we could have a real relationship.
that is not what I asked you.
stop cross-examining me.
then answer the question.
okay.
take the money out of it.
how?
I'm happy to give you and Seth the money.
you can pay me back.
you don't need a loan.
but Seth wants us to...
I know what Seth wants.
he wants you, at any cost, and he's willing to sacrifice anything and everything to have you, but it's your life, too.
what are you willing to sacrifice for?
to give anything for?
is it the restaurant?
is it Seth?
I think that's the question you need to answer.
come on. You can't be serious.
I'm not interested.
bull. -- Truth.
I know you!
well, maybe you don't know me as well as you think.
what are you doing here?
a restaurant?
Really? Come on!
I'm not leaving Cedar Cove.
don't pass this up.
I got financed for two boats.
I can only captain one.
the other one is yours for the taking. -- No.
you could make enough money... to buy another boat, your own boat.
I still can't believe you sold the first one.
for what? To run a restaurant?
Hey, the Lighthouse Restaurant is going to be fantastic when I'm done with it, and I will gladly buy any fish you can supply.
what if I make you a full partner?
I don't have any money.
Yeah, but you have skill, and I need that skill to double my profits.
what are you saying?
salary with a percent of profits, and a contract that will allow you to buy the second boat from me, as long as we stay partners.
Thanks, but...
no thanks.
I just hope she's worth it. Justine is.
and the only way to keep her is to get this restaurant up and running.
love.
Yeah.
man, I'm gonna miss you in Alaska.
Hey, can you do me a favor?
sure.
don't tell Justine about the job.
Oh... well, it's your funeral.
no.
it's my life, with the woman I love.
cheers to that.
there she is.
sorry I'm late. -- That's okay.
Hi, Justine. -- Hey, Derek.
you gonna join us?
he was just leaving.
I was? -- You were.
what about my beer?
take it to go.
it's good to see ya.
see you.
you hungry?
I'm starving.
so what did he want?
he's heading up to Alaska. He's got a couple of boats.
jealous?
I got everything I want right here.
Hello?
Johnny-boy.
look. Look, Sam, stop calling.
I appreciate everything that you've done for me...
you know, I should be in Seattle, getting ready to deliver a trunkload of fake I.D.s, greencards, passports, credit cards, to my guy down in L.A. but here I am, standing on some pier, because this is the only place you can get cell service in this stupid little town.
you're in Cedar Cove?
I am.
honey?
thought you might be hungry.
Oh, that's sweet, mom, but I don't have an appetite.
okay.
you should get back to cliff.
he left.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Why? -- Well, I ruined your date.
No! You did not.
now, you need to tell me what is going on inside that head of yours.
come here.
Oh, sorry!
are you gonna be okay?
Oh, hey, I am... better. Moving towards "okay."
Yeah.
Hey, guys.
how are things upstairs?
Shelly's better.
yeah? Is Olivia with her?
just stepped out to get some air.
okay.
listen, thank you for coming.
Oh, Jack, come on.
you and Olivia, and now Shelly and Eric, you guys are family, you know that.
Mm. - Anything changes...
I will call.
Yeah.
so how is Jack?
Really? -- Shaky.
Shelly?
she's just so scared, Bob.
yeah?
scared of having the baby, and then scared of raising the baby, with or without Eric.
what do you think she's going to do?
what do you hope she's gonna do?
the right thing.
Yeah, that's always the hardest, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Hey, do you need to stay here with Jack?
he promised he'd call.
look, we can either stay here and worry, or we go home and worry.
I got pie at home.
home it is.
Hello?
Hi. --You okay?
Yeah, I'm great. Let's go check on the kids.
okay. Good idea.
hi there.
evening, Grace.
Hey, guys. What's up?
we need to speak to Maryellen.
it's John, isn't it?
I'm afraid it is.
I told you I didn't want to call the police.
I didn't have any choice.
okay, somebody had better start telling me what is going on right now.
we got some information on John Bowman and the two men Maryellen met in the gallery.
it's not good.
come on in. Please.
is Shelly alright?
I waited for you to get back so I could to tell you to your face.
tell us what?
I'm gonna stop you.
nobody's giving my baby away. Not without my permission.
not you, or you, or Shelly.
Hey, Eric, you need to calm down.
she isn't the only one who has rights.
I'm going to hire a lawyer.
you aren't giving my baby away.
# Dreams of me and you #
nice.
# It seems, it seems that I can't shake those memories #
# I wonder if you feel the same way too #
# Girl, I do #
Oh, shit, it's work. Wait, turn it down. Turn it down.
Hello?
Jesse. - What?
I have to give a sound bite for the L. A. Times, so no noise for a minute.
I might actually get a call too, so if it's noisy, I'll be on a call.
okay. Ready?
all right. This year, all trends will head toward simplicity and comfort.
things like Roku, Vudu...
cookbooks and casual wear will see a spike in the market.
can I have a drag?
Yeah.
that's perfect. Thanks. - What'd you do?
seriously, can you not sit still for like two minutes?
we talked about this. No more smoking.
Hey, Disney Hall. - Yeah. I'm not doing it.
not doing what? - I am not doing that.
it's just a building. - It's not trending.
wanna go titty for titty? My arms are longer. My boobs are smaller.
focus on driving. - I am focused on dri...
great. - Jess, that place is amazing.
I'm on a really important call.
Oh, okay. - Yeah. I don't know what to say.
thank you for calling. - Is that about the job?
awesome. Thank you so much, man.
thank you, yeah. Talk soon. Okay, bye.
was that about the magazine job? - No.
but, Celeste, a swell came in last night.
northwest.
apparently, it is overhead and it is glassy.
what the fuck are you talking about? - Malibu.
the waves are crushing right now. - Are you talking about surfing? You're talking about surfing.
Yeah. Why are you not more excited?
I'm so psyched. I just thought that was about that job.
the illustration job. - Right. They haven't called me back.
honestly, I'm not dying to work there.
doesn't seem like you're dying to work at all.
I'm putting together a show. I'm going to sell stuff. You know it takes time.
I know. I know. - Okay. Can I drop you off at home now?
I just missed a wave. - At some point, I feel...
missed another. - All right.
two more just went by. - Okay.
I could be on those. - Take me home.
be back by 6 so you can shower? - Why shower?
Beth and Tucker, dinner. - Right. Yep.
have fun shredding your glassy peel. - Oh, so wrong.
love you. - Love you.
thank you.
did you guys end up seeing that band last week?
Oh, yeah. Fuck Your Mom?
they were for reals, dude. - Yeah.
you should get them as your wedding band. They're loud but probably pretty cheap.
or the band that opened for them, Please us, Christ. They were good.
they kind of shredded. - Guys, It's done. I told you.
we've already got the greatest swing band in New England.
Sugarfoot and the Swingin' Scrod. - No, no, no. We actually didn't.
we talked about this. Swing is so late 90s.
we're not gonna do that. We're not doing it. We're not...
I'm gonna eat your face, I love you so much.
we'll talk about it later. - And so now we turn to the menu.
Yes, I think the best idea is to get enchiladas and tacos...
and then we split the two, ja?
this is a clinical choice, but I must object to your strategy...
for I wish to enjoy the tacos alone.
no, but that is not fair. As long as I can have some bites, ja?
but we know about your bites, don't we? - No.
you take one and then you take many.
ja, this is true. - Ja, you do.
this is true.
we can't do this anymore.
Oh, God.
honey, weddings are so stressful, but I promise you, we know.
you guys will be fine. - Just fine.
Yeah. Oh, yeah, we are fine. - No, we're good.
what the fuck are you two doing?
what do you mean? - Yeah. What do you mean?
what do I mean? You two are not together.
it's not normal, okay?
you guys have been separated for six months.
you're getting divorced, all right?
and you spend every day together hanging out as if, like, it's no big deal.
guess what. It's fucking weird. - I don't think this is...
no. Tell them what you think. - Let's not play charades. It's weird.
there's no charades being played here. - No charades.
no charading. - No.
we are separated, and we're friends. You guys should be happy.
we fought all the time. We don't anymore.
you should be thrilled. You don't have to choose sides. It's the perfect breakup.
Yeah, everyone's cool.
everyone is not cool. - Not cool.
no one is cool here.
I'm sorry.
I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry.
baby. - Beth.
Beth is so angry. - Ja, she is buber angry.
this is too weird.
Hey, C.
can you help me with something? - What?
don't wanna pressure you into anything...
but this gentleman is awfully lonely and just...
here, I'll show you how it works. Just...
Oh, my God. - Oh, God.
Oh, God. - Oh, God.
Oh, he likes that.
wait, be quiet.
my roommate's next door. Don't make any sound.
all right. Oh, God. - Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
dude. - That was a big one.
Yeah.
Beth and Tucker are crazy. - Crazy.
right? - Yes.
I mean, it is not weird that we hang out all the time.
do you think it's weird we hang out all the time?
no. You're my best friend. - Yeah. You're my best friend too.
last time we didn't speak for more than a week was in 10th grade...
when you went to Space Camp Canada.
that was a brutal five weeks.
the antigravity training was crazy, though.
but I missed you.
me too.
look who's back.
his recovery time is insane. - Oh, no.
he's a college boy and he's ready to rock.
here we go.
I'm exhausted. - Yeah, me too.
dessert was good, right? - Oh, so good.
night. - Night.
Hey, it's kind of chilly tonight. How's your heat in there?
it's fine. I'm fine. - Okay. Good.
Hey, sorry I'm still living back here.
stay as long as you want. It's your studio.
also, it's really nice having you here. - For me too.
night. - Night. Love you.
love you too.
are you gonna...? No. - Here's your chai latte.
can I get a large coffee to go? - Soy cappuccino for David.
excuse me, sir? Sir.
sir. Yeah, you. Sorry.
you do realize that you just cut in front of a bunch of people, right?
I'm so sorry. I didn't know. - Did you not know?
I'm just in a big rush, so... - So you did know.
and I'm sure everyone here is in a rush. - Okay, is this really happening?
she was looking at the pastries, so I just... I thought...
it's not just her. It's everyone behind her.
if you wanna ask every single person if it's okay that you cut, be my guest.
don't assume your time is more important than others'.
thank you for the lecture. Have a great day, everybody. Not you.
american culture is dying, and there's an unrelenting appetite in this country...
for reality shows, talentless pop stars like Riley Banks...
recycled, bloated movie franchises.
the more we consume crap, the more we want crap.
you are what you eat.
it sounds utterly hopeless. Is there an upshot?
I think there will be a groundswell movement toward simplicity.
people will crave spiritual, mental and physical nourishment.
it'll be back to basics. - A lot to chew on.
for more on this gloomy but interesting subject...
look out for Celeste Martin's new book, Shitegeist...
on bookshelves Monday.
I had dinner with the drama club last night. - Who's that?
Beth and Tucker. They left in the middle of dinner...
because they don't approve of me and Jesse hanging out. Can you believe that?
it is so judgy. We're fine. If we were gay, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
we'd just be friends. We don't even think about it. - You are not ready to let go of each other.
there's nothing wrong with that. - There's nothing wrong with it.
I mean, what do you think? - Well, to be honest...
Oh, my God. We're signing Riley Banks?
what the fuck, Scott? I just trashed her on TV.
that's why I wanted you to come in. It's a huge account.
we built this company so we didn't have to sign accounts like Riley Banks.
you and I may not have a company if we don't take Riley Banks.
I don't understand. She's like a vagina and a hairdo.
she's releasing a new CD.
she wants us to do the branding and merchandising.
fine. I'm gonna go eat my feelings.
if you want my opinion, I do think you should start dating.
Scott, I'm fine. I have so much time. I'm not worried.
do me a favor and get your fuck on before you meet the next guy.
what is that? What are you doing?
sorry. I was trying to be your saucy gay friend.
didn't feel good. - No. Don't.
the economic climate is real bad, man.
I think my business is taking the hardest hit of all.
it's brutal. Is it just me or is nobody talking about it?
you sell weed, Skillz. - Not for long, dude.
you seen those weed pharmacies on every fucking corner?
they're killing me.
I mean, I think I gotta branch out, start working in methamphetamines.
or teach preschool, you know?
I love kids, and I just, I don't know, always wanted to do that.
sorry, dude.
I know this is serious talky time, but look at the fucking seat on that girl.
that is a party. - I don't think it's over.
what? Her butt? No, it goes on forever. - No, man. Me and Celeste.
she's overwhelmed and confused, but I think she's gonna come around.
Oh, no. Really, pal?
I mean, it's been a while, you know...
but I think it's time to accept that and move on.
right? Call that dime Veronica. - No, dude. That was a one-time thing.
Celeste does not know about it, so don't tell her.
I didn't know that was a hit-and-run. It's not like you really liked her, so...
she was cool, but she's not Celeste.
okay, but remember, you can't reheat a souffle.
what does that mean? - It's L. A. There's bettys everywhere.
it's good to remind Celeste you can pull a little wool, right?
make her sweat a bit. - Yeah, I guess.
how are you? - Good.
so, what do you want, man? - Maybe I just don't wanna start over.
no, I meant, like, what do you want? Do you want yogurt?
can I have a goji-berry-and-green-tea swirl with yogurt chips and Cap'n Crunch?
would you go out with my friend ever? - No.
Where's your wife? You guys are here every day together.
we're actually separated. - Oh, cool.
I mean, bummer or whatever, but, okay, I'll go.
just like that.
cool.
you want it swirled or side by side?
what? - I need to say one thing.
then I'm not gonna say another word about it.
I'm sorry I wigged on you at dinner. But I think it's stupid you're not together.
I do. You guys are best friends.
that's the hard part. Nothing else matters.
Beth, I love Jesse dearly...
but he doesn't have a checking account or dress shoes.
the father of my children will have a car. You know?
Jesse will always be my best friend.
okay. I said what I had to say.
not gonna say another word. I just needed to say that.
it's a huge mistake that he's living in that guesthouse.
Celeste, you are breaking his heart, slowly. - Jesse is fine.
he's fine.
Hey.
you're not working?
you're watching the Beijing Olympics again?
and you're crying again.
Matthias' wife died in a car accident last year.
Hey, did you finish that artwork for the Pop Formm website yet?
no, it's not done yet. I'm still working on it.
I think you're gonna like it. - Can you finish it tonight?
no. Actually...
sit down for one second. I wanna tell you something important.
okay.
does it have something to do with the work you owe me...
that's late that we were just talking about?
tonight I am going on a date.
and I'm gonna date people.
that's great.
it is? - Yeah.
no, Jess. Please don't cry again. Good for you.
doesn't bother you? - No.
okay. Yeah, it's yogurt girl from Yogurt Yurt.
yogurt girl. Yeah, she's cute.
she's really young, right? - Super young, yeah.
but her body is, like, all-time. - Okay, there's no need for that, but...
wow, that's great. That's really great.
this is good. You gotta crawl before you walk.
she's not gonna be wife number two, but whatever.
no. It's just a date.
Hey. Big move.
I'm proud of you.
thank you. - Can I get up now?
Oh, yeah. - Okay.
you're gonna be great. Call me after.
no.
I was in school, but I dropped out because I really wanna work in fashion.
but it's really hard to find a paid internship.
so I went back to school, and now I work at Yogurt Yurt.
I'm looking to make money doing something I love.
I'm sure the universe has my back.
the right thing will come along, you know?
I mean, you get it, obviously, right? - Totally.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Jesse.
do It on My Face"?
this song is about being who you are.
unless who you are sucks.
everybody shut up.
they said it would be in new releases.
where is it?
no.
now, that's what I call placement.
you shouldn't steal it, even if it is your book.
I'm just rearranging some things.
there. - You can't do that.
Yes, I can. - An employee didn't pick you.
doesn't matter.
Hey. Employee picks.
Congrats. That's awesome. - Thanks.
what happened? - Employee picks.
Jesse?
Hey. - Veronica.
Hey. - Hey.
how's it going? - Good.
yeah? - Yeah.
how you been? - I've been good.
how have you been? - Good.
you look great. - Thanks. You too.
what are you doing here?
checking out books.
same. - Yep.
how's your clothespin collage going?
you remember that.
it's good. It's good. Slow but good.
well, don't give it up, because it's really unique and beautiful.
I hope that didn't sound too... - No, no. That's really sweet and...
good. - Yeah, that means a lot. Thank you.
you're welcome.
I had so much fun with you that night. I'm sorry I didn't call.
I had a lot of fun too.
cool.
Hey. - Hi.
I have to find more places to put my book.
Veronica, these are my friends.
Celeste. - Hi.
Beth and Tucker. - Hi.
Hey. - Hi.
how are you? Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too.
you wrote that book.
I just read an excerpt online. It's really compelling.
thank you. Thank you so much. That's very nice. - You're welcome.
well, nice to meet you.
Bye. - Bye.
Bye. - See you later.
Bye.
Bye. - What was that?
Veronica.
story? - No story.
just a girl I met a little while ago.
she's pretty. She looks like a young me.
excuse me. Hi.
do you have any more copies of this book Shitegeist...
for me to give to my friends? Because I heard it's excellent.
no, no. - Just one second. Hey.
just got out of the show. - How was it?
fucking dope. - Hey, are you busy now?
no, I'm not busy. - Can you help me build this dresser?
okay. - I can't do it alone.
all right, all right. Okay, bye. - Jesse, I need you.
dude, I gotta go home.
after the show, it's the after-party.
I know, but she's got an IKEA dresser she needs me to help her "build.
Oh, it's like that?
I told you, man, she just needed a little bit more time.
I got this. - Oh, she's about to get it.
I'm in here. Fuck Sweden.
what up?
it's easier to build the Brooklyn Bridge. - We got this. It's just a dresser.
fucking fuck. Fuck me!
what, do they make a piece of furniture that's impossible to build on purpose...
just to fuck with you?
thank you.
wait.
I've got it.
perfect. - Fucking layup.
it's like Koons meets Basquiat meets...
serra meets...
corky from Life Goes On.
he's a vegan, you know. - Oh, cherish.
that is so cute. - You're cute.
you're cute.
Hey. What are you doing?
I love you.
okay.
that was a bad idea. So sorry.
no, don't be sorry. It was nice.
Jess.
come on.
drinking and the dresser and...
I think, you know... We're seeing other people.
well, yeah, but just because...
Oh, God.
I'm an idiot.
I just thought... - You thought what?
well, I wasn't clearly thinking, or else I wouldn't have let that happen.
you didn't think we were getting back together.
it's not like...
you know, there's a guy you can call at IKEA.
he'll build your dresser for you. You should call him.
probably fuck you too.
Oh, Jess. - I'm a fucking idiot.
Oh, Jess, come on. Jesse.
Jess?
Hey, Jess, it's me.
I'm on my way to the airport, but I wanted to talk to you.
I don't know what happened last night.
I hope you're okay.
okay, bye. Call me.
Hey, you've reached Jesse. Leave me a message.
Hey, it's me again.
I'm in San Francisco. I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
and I miss you.
call me. Okay. Bye.
I'm sorry.
of course.
stupid.
Hey, you're back. I wanna talk to you.
I know. I wanna talk to you too.
where have you been? It's been like two weeks.
there's so much to lay down.
like, did you know, the pay-per-view porn is available in Cantonese now.
Really? - Yeah.
I'm really near your house. Can I just come by? It's kind of important.
there's 68 colleges in Boston. Why were the kids in my group so dumb?
I mean, they were, like, barely making sense.
they were not speaking English. They were... - Hey. I really gotta tell you something.
actually, me too.
wait. Are you gay?
please tell me you're gay. That'd be so funny.
no. Not gay. This is going to be hard to believe...
but you went on another date. - I'm having a baby.
I'm having a baby. - What do you mean?
I'm having a child.
with another person?
Yes, with another person.
wait, what?
sorry. What...?
what the fuck? With who?
you met her, actually, the other day at the bookstore.
but that's not even physically possible. That was two weeks ago.
Yeah.
truth is, I slept with her like three months ago.
shit. Okay.
well, I didn't know about that, but that's not important right now. Okay.
what do you need me to do?
Oh, no. You don't have to do anything.
I really wanna make it work with her.
excuse me one second.
hello.
what? - I said, hello.
Hi.
how's your practice? - How's my practice?
it's fine. - I'll get that mat for you.
Thanks. - I see you here a lot.
you've got a great Warrior 2.
your Chaturanga is, like, incredibly balanced.
I'm still working that position, but... are you single?
are you really doing this right now? You're really doing this right now.
I know. I'm gonna go for it. I don't do this. It's just happening. I'm gonna...
gonna jump right in there. - I'm jumping in.
captain Conversation.
do you...? Hey, I'm Paul. Put it there.
Celeste. - Celeste.
that's a great name. So here's my card.
that's my number, e-mail. If you need to fax me...
you bring cards to yoga?
Hi. How are you? Come on in.
great flow today.
I'm not good at this. Little help? - Financial analyst. Cool.
not really. It's not that cool. It's all right.
did you tell me what you did for a living? - No, I didn't.
well, will you? I'd love to know.
I'm a trend forecaster. I forecast trends.
trend forecaster. Yeah.
you serious? I'm sorry I thought you were just fucking with me.
you traded in your Porsche for an Audi because you're afraid you'll lose your job.
you just bought a Droid because it makes you seem business-oriented...
unlike the iPhone, which you think is for teenage girls.
you go to yoga because you went to a sub-lvy League school.
you spent the last 10 years working long hours, drinking on weekend
you thought it was time to do something spiritual.
it was nice to meet you, Paul.
Hey. - Hey.
where were you on the New York call this morning? - I figured you could handle it.
Yeah. Well, anyway, the artwork came in from Berlin.
it's good, but it... - Breaking news.
Jesse is having a baby with some girl.
did you even know he was seeing someone?
no, it's somebody he slept with once months ago.
now he's gonna try to "make it work." Plane crash.
I don't even know what to say.
I'm so sorry, Celeste. Are you okay?
Scott, I'm totally fine. Yes.
are you? - Yes.
I wasn't gonna have his baby, so good for him.
I'm not in love with him anymore. It makes it easier, you know.
I have a date tonight, actually. - That's great.
feel like it might be nice to go out and be admired.
I agree. Go be admired.
who knows? You may actually simulate human emotion.
thank you. - Thank you.
my foot actually pronates...
so my IT band is strained when I run, which is really painful.
the foot specialist made me these really great orthotics.
they shape around my foot. They make it so much better when I'm running.
I cannot explain how amazing it feels.
actually I'm one of those people who... - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. My ex is here.
Oh, we just made eye contact.
maybe he didn't see me. - I think it's... It's okay.
Nope, he saw me. He saw me. - It's okay.
he's coming over here now. Know what? You should leave.
what? - Yeah, you should just go.
I'm not gonna leave. - It would be better.
it's too late because he's here now. Hey.
Hey. How's it going? - Good.
thought I'd say hi. I'm Jesse. - That's Mac.
it's Max. - Matt.
Nope, Max. - Nice. Cool.
we're just eating. I'm on a date. We're on a date. I'm dating.
Oh, cool. The puttanesca special is the bomb here.
Oh, good news. That's what I ordered. - Nice. Cool.
who are you here with?
Oh, I'm just rolling solo, watching the Lakers game.
it's Kobe-LeBron, right? - Yes.
so psyched. - Yeah, man, epic.
TiVo'd it. - Nice. Cool.
well, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
C, good to see you. Have fun.
he's cool.
thank you. - Thank you.
are you okay? - What? Oh, nothing.
do you like bread?
that was great. Should we do it again?
Wednesday? Sushi?
I don't think we should. - Because of the mercury poisoning?
my acupuncturist said that's a myth. - No. I think that...
I think you could use a little more time to get over your divorce.
I mean, look, it took me a long time to start dating after mine. I get it.
I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine.
I guess you're just not a match for me, so...
Yeah. Well...
have a good night.
Thanks. Okay. - And good luck.
whatever.
Hi, honey. Beth. - Hi. Hi.
wow, you're really out of breath. I'm sorry, did you just fucking run here?
Yeah. - From your house?
I started running. It's really fun. - Okay, you're sopping in sweat.
isn't that like 12 miles? - Thirteen-point-six.
but it's good because it just, like, really gets my endorphins up.
it helps me clear my head.
the Riley account is a handful. I have been so swamped.
good. I'm glad you've been so busy. Have you spoken to Jesse?
I actually ran into him, and I thought he was actually looking a little fat.
Really? I feel like when I saw him, he was looking kind of fit.
so you saw Jesse? - Yeah. Yeah, I have. I've seen him.
and you've hung out with what's-her-name?
Veronica? Yes, I have.
can I get a rush delivery on that? - She's dumb, right?
no, she's not dumb. She's... She's simple.
does 7 A. M. to 9 P. M. work as a window for you?
simple means dumb, though.
no, actually. Simple in a really elegant way.
elegant.
I think we're done here. - Yeah, that window is fine.
I thought you would be happy for Jesse. - Oh, no, I totally am.
I just didn't realize that Monica was elegant.
you know her name's Veronica. And honestly, honey, you'd really like her.
okay, don't do that.
are you having regrets about Jesse?
what? No. Not one.
will you let me drive you home? I'm afraid you'll drown.
okay. I actually have a date tonight. I should probably shower, right?
Yeah, I would. Yes, shower.
who's the date? - Rupert Bates.
rupert Bates. The Gap model?
Oh, my God. He's so hot. But he's like 11 years old.
he's actually 22.
skillz set me up with him. He's gonna be a star.
he's filming 20, 000 BC right now, which is the prequel to 10, 000 BC.
Oh, fuck, I love that movie. - I know.
# A star fell from the sky #
# Look at you and I realize #
# It's the way your body moves #
# First time that I saw your face #
# You're like a little alien from outer space #
# I'm gonna follow you to the moon #
that was so good.
actually, I wrote it for my mom. - Lucky lady.
why do you wanna follow your mom to the moon?
she's the best. You'd love her if you met her. - Yeah. I bet.
so how do you know Skillz?
skillz provides me with the happy smoky green treats.
awesome. - I'm sorry, but you are just...
Hello, special one.
no.
this is crazy, but I just totally forgot I left a candle burning at my house.
I have to go. - No, of course.
I'm so sorry.
I'll send you a copy of the song when it's done.
my hair is so dry. It looks like straw.
here, do you want an Adderall? - No, that shit makes me feel like a robot.
speaking of robot, who the hell designed this place?
I feel like Spock is about to walk around the corner.
Hi, Riley. I'm Celeste. I'm a partner at Pop Forum.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
you're kind of pretty.
thank you. I'm just gonna sneak in here.
why am I breaking out? - Too much sugar, coffee, alcohol.
I think it's my new skin regime. Yeah.
it's "regimen.
what?
a regime is a system of government. The word is... The word's "regimen.
Thanks, Scrabble. It was really nice to meet you.
in thinking about your new brand, we wanted a sense of where you currently exist.
we set up a number of focus groups throughout the country.
your testing is really high in the Midwest, which is wonderful.
we'll be rolling those out to a few different cities.
Celeste has come up with a number of ideas for logos, which are looking really great.
Celeste, you wanna...? - Yes. Yes. Here.
our first round is based heavily...
on a kind of hip-hop, retro, throwback, industrial flair.
the one I was talking to my girl Savannah about.
really trying to get the urban flavor in there for the tweens.
do you guys have any snacks?
like sushi?
Hello, special one.
sounds so awful. - It was so awful.
I mean, where are the guys who don't wear makeup for a living?
how about a little intellect? Intellect never hurt anybody.
wait. You never met Nick, right? - Nick?
Nick Moran. - The photographer?
no. You know him? - Yeah, we went to school together.
this could be perfect.
I'm uncomfortable with dating, and I don't really like any of it.
trust me, you will like him.
and also, I love cock.
you gotta work a little harder to integrate the gayness, Scott.
Yeah.
good night. - Night.
I'll hook that up tomorrow. - Great.
nailed it. Way to go, Becky.
go, team, right? - Yeah!
what the fuck is a BabyBjorn? - It's a very, very tiny Swedish man.
it's actually a child carrier that allows the baby to benefit from intimacy...
without the confinement of a stroller.
how do you know that? - Beth.
Yeah, we go to a lot of baby showers.
I put a lot of babies in the ladies.
how's Celeste? - Who?
Celeste. - She's all right.
I'm kind of fine-tuning her cannabis levels right now, but she's okay.
she doesn't smoke weed. - She does now. She loves that shit.
fucking Snoop Dogg.
birthing towel, breast pump, diaper genie? Fuck.
I'm seriously having a baby. - You'll do great, man.
Hey, Skillz. Who's your buddy?
I don't know. I thought he was your friend.
not with me. - Really?
I don't know him.
I waited like 21 hours, three of them soaked in my own pee.
Oh, my God. - But I finally got the shot of Gaddafi.
my God, I've totally seen this one.
you've seen it? - Yeah.
I'm such a big fan. That's so cool. - Thank you.
I feel like he's kind of smiling. - He is.
I mean, I think the piss stain running down my jeans made him laugh.
seriously, I was soaked.
the world will think you're brilliant. I'll be the only one who knows.
what?
we missed our reservation for 8: 30. - Oh, no.
you want me to call down, see if they can still take us?
should I just, like...?
you guys still take us for like 9, 9: 15?
I don't think anybody... - Is that cool?
you can't do that? - You can.
I just don't think anybody will hear you.
you know what? I actually would be cool...
let's just get room service.
room service? - Yeah.
okay. I could do room service.
cool. - That sounds good. I like that.
I'm so happy this worked out. It's so nice to meet you.
can't remember the last time I felt like this.
Yes.
what are you doing? - What do you think I'm doing?
no, no, no. Don't do that. Things were going so well.
I want you to watch me. - There's no watching.
I'm almost there. - Where? Don't. No. I can't...
almost there.
Yeah, come on. That's it.
move. - Yeah, it's coming.
here it comes. Here it comes.
Hey. So I'm glad we can meet up.
there's this place by me, Vegan Vittles on Elysian Way. Call me if you get lost.
what the fuck is a vegan vittle?
just tell her to be here tomorrow.
Hey. - Sorry, one second.
just have to send this e-mail.
there. Hi.
Hi. What's up? - A lot.
green tea? - We have decaf green tea.
I'll just get some water. - Okay. Anything for you?
I'd like the veganchilada, please. - Sure.
Cashew-cheese sauce on the side. - Yeah.
I'd like to take a look at your seaweed menu.
Yeah. There you go.
no, I'm good, thanks. - Awesome. Baltic kelp.
Yep. - I'll have that. Thank you.
you look good. - Thanks. You look good too.
I've been doing a lot of Pilates.
Really? - Yeah. Veronica's a dancer.
she has all this equipment at her house, so I've just been getting into it.
well, I know all this has been really weird.
it's only weird if you think it's weird.
okay.
there's apparently a holdup on the divorce papers on your end...
and Veronica's actually not a citizen, so...
what? Where's she from? - Belgium.
Belgium. Elegant.
what? - Nothing.
point is, we need to get married...
and I'm really sorry to bug you, but I really need you to sign those papers.
okay, Jesse.
well, I've been busy with work, because some of us work for a living...
so I'm sorry I haven't had time to focus on helping you get on with your new life.
I know. I'm sorry.
what makes you think you're suitable to be a dad, even?
we never talked about kids. - You had reservations about kids.
I had reservations about kids with you. - Yeah, well, ditto.
I think Veronica's gonna be an amazing mother.
low blow.
I'll sign the papers.
you're ridiculous. This place is ridiculous.
fucking cashew-vegan-kelp bullshit.
Jesse's a fucking vegan?
Yeah, a vegan whose work is being shown.
at the Gagosian. - At the Gagos...?
what? - Yep.
how does anybody even know about his art... ?
you know what? I don't wanna know anything.
my God, he's on fire right now.
breaking up with me was the best thing he ever did.
I should break up with me. - Oh, stop.
somebody else's success does not mean your demise.
except for Jesse's.
what are you guys dressed as again? - Bieber.
he just got a buzz cut. - What? Fuck!
shut up. - When?
like two hours ago. It was on Perez.
goddamn it. - His hair was everything.
he's really talented.
what's with the costume parties in the middle of the summer? Hot.
I need to fucking drink.
car bombs in the fucking kitchen. - Yes.
no. - Yes, I'm doing that. Yes.
you wanna wait a little bit?
I say "car," you say "bomb." Car! - Bomb!
three, two, one, drink!
three, two, one. She lost. - Come on.
she lost. - That's pretty good for...
no, don't be nice. Hey.
what even are you supposed to be?
Yeah. - What? Oh, white trash.
what is that? - White trash.
white "shrash"? Shrash? - White trash.
it's white trash.
Celeste. - Yoga.
I haven't seen you there in a while. - I know. I've been running a lot.
it really helps you keep in better shape. - I can see that's important to you.
how's your practice?
that's funny. White trash?
what are you? - I'm a cereal killer, obviously.
Hey, you were right.
what do you mean? - You were right about me.
the car, the phone...
the yoga.
except I went to an Ivy League school. I went to Cornell.
Congratulations. - Thanks, man.
that's barely an Ivy. - I know.
barely.
do you smoke? - At parties.
let's go. Me too.
I'm sorry for that day at the studio. I just feel really open after yoga.
don't say "open." No.
your costume is so great. You're gonna ruin it.
I'm kidding. You know why I go to yoga?
I go to yoga to meet girls.
I believe that. - You do?
Yeah.
speaking of, what's the deal with you and me? I mean, are we...?
is it happening or what?
well, the deal with you and me...
is that my husband of six years wants a divorce...
because he wants to marry the woman who's carrying his child.
that's the deal with you and me.
sounds tough.
he barely knows her.
he's just lost...
and he's just going about everything so wrong.
and you're right.
now what?
what does that mean?
I mean, do you wanna be right, or do you wanna be happy?
okay, listen, Yoga, I don't wanna be right. I know I'm right, okay?
people will let you down. I have accepted that fact.
but knowing that...
makes it impossible to be happy.
but at least it's fucking real.
no one has ever given a more self-righteous monologue...
wearing a trash bag. - Shut up.
okay, drunkie, let's go home.
Paul. - Justin Bieber.
Justin Bieber. Hi.
Justin Bieber too. - Hi.
just kidding. Beth.
you want another drink? - Two.
one drink. - One drink.
Hey, you've reached Jesse. Leave me a message.
Hey, I still have a bunch of your shit. I'm just gonna drop it off. Okay.
you're gonna be a really good dad.
what made you say that?
I don't know. I just know it.
well, that's an extravagant purchase for a freelance artist and his Belgian bride.
shit.
shit, shit, shit.
I just realized I don't know your middle name.
it's Godelieve. - Goldleaf?
no, Godelieve. It means "loved by the gods.
it's Dutch.
pretty. - Thanks.
what's yours? - Mordechai.
okay. What does it mean?
it means I'm very, very Jewish.
right.
Celeste?
Hey.
Hey. What are you doing here?
I just was dropping off some of your stuff.
why were you in the trash can?
I lost something.
in the trash? - Yeah.
it was my bracelet, but I got it back. So it's... I'm fine.
Oh, you remember Veronica.
Yes. Hi. Wow, you're so pregnant. Oh, my God.
Yeah. - I love your sweater.
Oh, thank you. - Good compliment.
I'm gonna go, because I'm late for something, so...
sure you don't wanna come in for tea?
no, no, you guys have a good afternight. I'm gonna...
is that mine?
what? Yeah, I don't know how I got...
I'm so glad we did this. Bye, you guys. - Okay.
step out of the shadows, girl, and into the light.
chips are gonna fall, you know? No need to trip.
what are they like together? - Who?
Oh, Jesse and Veronica? - Yeah.
they're okay, you know?
he's trying, but it's not all rainbows and unicorns over there, you know?
so they're not happy? - No, I didn't say that.
listen, he's my friend, you know...
and I love him, but you're my friend too, you know?
and if you ever need, like, any kind of special friendship...
you know, like, just someone to be with you and hold you...
and caress you and be good to you in ways that maybe guys aren't...
I think I could be that guy.
no. - Good. Good, good.
so where do you live?
I'm in Westwood, in a condo.
cool. - You're gonna love this place.
never been so relaxed in your life.
there you go.
this is a very unique place to take a date.
Yeah, I take all my dates here.
Oh, I feel so special. - You are.
right, Nana?
they all are.
how's being right going for you?
Oh, you know, not that well, really.
I was on a real winning streak. That's why I called you.
you know what? I'm happy you did.
why would you take me to a place where Asian people beat you up?
but how do you feel? - I feel... I feel really good, actually.
so shut up, then.
what are we doing now? - Don't try to control everything.
you need to let go. In yoga, we call it vairagya.
don't with the yoga.
yo. - What's up.
what's going on? - How you doing?
Hey, this is Celeste. - Celeste, what's up? Matt.
is Louis here? Yeah? Good crowd?
good crowd? Like your grandma? Where are we?
what is this?
this is her first time here.
check it out.
Oh, my God.
this place is really cool. - You sound surprised.
I am surprised. You live in Westwood.
what do you want to drink? - Beer?
Yeah. - Yeah?
how you doing, man?
Hi, sweetheart. Can I get two beers?
don't burn yourself. Jesus.
thank you. - Thanks.
Cheers. - Cheers.
this is quite a spot.
Oh, no.
you like to dance? - Yeah. Guess you do too.
you're good. - Oh, you're good.
what was that for?
Vairagya, bro. Don't try to control everything.
I really like the logo. - Oh, good. Yeah, I think it's perfect.
Yeah, the Keith Haring influence is pretty cool.
Yeah, there is a little bit of that going on.
are you mocking me? - No, I just...
I'm impressed that you know about art.
Why? Because I'm a pop star or because I was homeschooled?
whatever. Do you know what your problem is?
contempt prior to investigation. - I'm sorry?
you think you're smarter than everybody, and that is your dark little prison.
nice shoes.
dark little prison?
you don't know my life. You don't know me.
you know what's a dark little prison is having to wear midriffs for a living.
that's a dark little prison. Give me a break.
that's what I'm talking about.
what the fuck?
I started smoking again. - Yeah, I can see that.
I don't know what the rules are, and I'm sure I'm breaking them...
but I really miss you.
do you wanna come in?
Veronica's actually pretty good friends with the assistant gallerist there...
and he really liked my stuff, so...
I don't know, we'll see. - Jess, that's so great.
I'm so happy for you. - Yeah.
Yeah, it's great.
I should probably get home. - Yeah.
it's really nice to see you.
you should go.
can't we just lie here a little bit?
can't believe I'm having a baby and it's not with you.
yeah?
Hey, we have a massive problem on our hands.
I don't... I don't see anything.
it's a penis and a butt.
Really? No, I don't... I don't see it.
there's a penis, and there's the penis going into the butt.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, it's a cock... It's a cock... It's a cock in a butt.
Oh, my Go...
Oh, my God. That's really bad.
this isn't a joke, Celeste.
there's homosexual butt sex in the logo.
does Riley think we're stupid? I mean, who are these sick people?
neither Riley nor a representative from Pop Form...
the marketing company responsible, could be reached...
there you go.
let me know if you need anything else. - Thanks.
Hey. - Hey.
thanks for meeting me here.
I don't know what I'm wearing.
you kind of look like a crazy cat lady. - Yeah.
I just can't buy anything nice, because they'll just ruin it, you know?
look, Celeste... - No, let me just say something, okay?
I don't know what's going on in your other situation...
but for the record, I fucked up.
I was cavalier with you, and I took us for granted.
and I know this sounds crazy, but I would be remiss if I didn't just...
if you were open to it, I feel like I could do better...
with you, with us.
and if there is still a chance, I'd love to know.
Jesse.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
Hey.
Hey. Why'd you come over last night?
I don't know. - No, I think you do know.
it was a mistake. I shouldn't have come. - You fucking coward.
I'm having a baby.
I need to figure out a way to make it work with Veronica.
I'm trying to change. - Why didn't you change for me?
I don't think you really wanted me to.
Wow. Wow. All I did was wait for you to grow up.
I rooted for you. I fucking paid for everything.
I did everything for you. - Yeah, and I was never your equal.
and you know what, I think you preferred it that way.
wait. Wait. I know that my success was never okay for you.
what do you want? - I want you to admit that you're wrong.
wrong about what?
what did you expect me to do, wait for you to meet someone first?
is that how you saw it happening?
look, I didn't expect to meet someone so fast, but I did.
I have a real chance of being happy. I don't wanna blow that.
well, you know what, Jesse? You definitely will blow it.
you know, I feel sorry for you.
you might actually be alone your whole life.
don't ever call me. - Yeah, don't worry about it.
no, no, no.
no, no.
okay.
thank you.
he's so sad. - Totally.
wait.
no. He's painting little rabbits. He's so happy.
he's so sad. I know. I went to art camp.
Oh, word?
fuck.
all right.
if that's how it's going down, that's how it's going down right now.
hit it. Go get it.
that's the best thing that's happened to me in months.
shit will get better.
will it? You don't know that.
I can't believe he did this to me. - Who? J?
he didn't do nothing. You wanted a divorce.
Yeah, but I didn't want it like this.
when we're no longer able to change a situation...
we're challenged to change ourselves.
Viktor Frankl.
or Biggie Smalls. It might be Biggie Smalls.
I don't know. I don't remember.
fuck, man. I am fucking high. Are you high?
I'm so high. All right, I gotta go.
can I come? - No.
can you get me some Del Taco? - No.
do you think the Obamas really love each other?
Yeah. Yeah, I really do.
no more questions.
take it easy on that shit. It is not for kids.
Hey.
Hi, honey. - Hi.
you remember Eileen. - You have more ranch dressing?
it's the fucking bomb. - Did you finish...?
Beth is getting married.
I was married once. You remember? These guys are in for a fucking dogfight.
let's go get you a soda. - A dogfight.
you're a dogfight.
I don't wanna be alone forever.
Oh, honey. You're not gonna be alone forever.
you're just in a time-out till you sober up.
I'm gonna sit here. I'm not gonna embarrass you, okay?
okay. - Okay.
we should get Nick Nolte out of here, huh?
Hey, Riley. I am calling to talk to you...
about the error in your logo.
I'm so, so sorry.
and I just wanna let you know that I am on top of it.
please call me back. Thank you.
do you feel like the dress I'm wearing reads more like eggshell or rose petal?
rose petal's okay. Eggshell is too whitish to do two days in a row.
you look great. - Honey, I need your help.
I have like an hour, and you owe me...
because you humped my nana yesterday.
the fuck does Riley Banks know?
nothing. She's a tart.
Yes, she's a tart. She's got a cute little hot bod.
she's moderately talented. - Not even.
five years and it's a wrap on that face. - If three, four.
why is she telling me anything about my life?
she's a stupid litt...
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - What?
I never hung up. I didn't hang up the call.
crap.
you gotta get it.
Hey, Riley, what's up?
Hi.
listen, I... This is a really nice place.
the thing is, I've been having a hard time in my own life.
so when you said that thing about contempt and investigation...
can you just shut up for a minute?
I just found out that my boyfriend cheated on me.
Oh. Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I didn't even know you had a boyfriend.
Yeah, exactly. Nobody knew.
he didn't want anyone to know, because it would be bad for his image and...
he's just such a fucking asshole.
now my career might be over because you decided to put a penis in my logo.
thank you for that. - I know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
come here.
Why? - Come here. Just come here. It's okay.
it's okay. It's okay.
I'm just so sad. And tired.
and now I'm gonna be alone like you.
okay, you don't know what you're saying right now. It's okay.
are you crying about sports?
just reminds me of someone.
is this about a girl?
I'm not gay. - No, I know. I meant a boy.
Yeah.
do you miss him?
Yeah, I do.
they all fucking suck.
kind of.
it really never gets better? Like, not even when you're old?
no.
but you do.
can we hug again? - Yeah.
I won't, no. Crap.
no, no, no. I'm at the airport.
Beth, I'm sitting at the gate.
of course I have my dress.
Hi, sir. I'm so sorry to bother you, but is there any way I could cut in line?
I'm the maid of honor at this wedding. Hi. I'm sorry to bother you.
maybe you heard me talking to the last gentleman, but I need to get my dress.
she pursued her love of Spanish man but missed her Tucker more than just a friend.
our princess returned home to her loving prince and they've been together ever since.
we love you, Bethy.
now we're gonna turn it over to Celeste...
Beth's best friend in the world.
Wow. That... Thanks, girls.
that was... There are no words for what that was.
um... Ahem. How do you get a nun pregnant? You fuck her.
thank you, Reverend. Appreciate it a lot.
it is not easy to get to Rhode Island from Los Angeles.
there was a cab to a plane to a cab to a train to a rental car.
there was maybe a rickshaw in there somewhere.
somewhere a donkey.
but the truth is...
I would go anywhere for Beth...
because she's my best friend and I love her so much...
and I'm so happy for her.
when we were in college, senior year we had this tradition.
Beth and Tucker and me and Jesse would meet...
come rain or shine, every Sunday at the Bishop.
and there was always something there with these two...
even though they were just friends.
just, like, an ease that they had with each other.
they are perfect.
at last, love wins.
Beth and Tucker...
you guys are lucky, so lucky to be best friends.
work hard at that.
and respect that.
be patient.
and...
you don't always have to be right.
even if you are...
doesn't fucking matter anyway.
fight for it every day.
I wish I had.
Cheers.
this might not be the best time to talk about it...
but at some point we're gonna have to address Tucker's dance moves.
he's so special.
so your speech was...
beautiful
thank you.
I meant it.
I know.
you know what else is beautiful?
Oh, no. - Oh, yes.
do we dare? - We do.
here, in front of everyone? - Of course.
all right, maybe just once. - Oh, my God.
talk to me. Oh, yeah. - Oh, God.
pointy tip, thick stem.
you're a bad boy. - You're a grower.
you have graduated and moved on to an adult life.
Oh, God. Oh, no. - Oh, God. Oh, no.
I'm a baby corn. I'm not a big corn. - Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. - Oh, God.
Oh, dude, it's so rotten.
Hey.
Hey. - What are you guys doing?
Oh, nothing. Just... - It's this thing that Jesse and I do.
we take this thing that resembles, like, a tiny little penis...
and then we, like...
I don't really get it. - It's stupid.
it's stupid. - They're about to serve dinner.
okay. - Wanna sit down?
Yeah, yeah.
see you on the dance floor, Celeste? - Yeah.
do it, do it, do it.
I love you, baby. - I love you, baby.
it sounds like the most embarrassing speech ever.
how are you gonna show your face in front of your friends again?
Yeah, well, weirdly, I'm happy that I did it. I feel better somehow.
this song is my bitch! Yeah!
the gays really know how to party, huh? - What do you mean?
this is a gay club.
it's opening night. It doesn't know what it is yet.
Riley, the club is called Swallow. - I totally dated that guy.
excuse me. Could you tell your friend Riley that we worship her?
she's so pretty.
sure. I'll tell her when she's done dancing.
you are aware that the logo is a...? - A dick in a butt? Yeah.
all of our friends are, like, rocking it. It's kind of become like gay Izod.
it's amazing.
yo. - The tweens don't want her anymore...
Scott, but the gays do.
you're gay. Start thinking gay. Ten percent of Americans are gay.
gay Izod. It's great.
she could be Lady Gaga by this time next year. Huge market.
you might have turned the cock in the butt around.
cock in the butt is gonna be huge.
Hi.
thirty-eight points for me, plus 50 points for using all my tiles.
wait, wait, wait. "Zooecia"? - Yeah.
no, that's not a word. That's my hoochie cousin's name.
so I was at this club the other night, and there was a tranny dressed like me.
Oh, my God, that's so sweet. - I know.
that's a huge compliment. - He was so hot too.
I mean, it was still me. - That is so sweet.
Celeste. - Rupert.
you never called me back.
you know, I think I lost my...
do you know Riley? This is Rupert. - Hi. I'm actually a big fan.
likewise.
get in there. Get in there.
very gentle.
help me out here.
all right, both of us.
I can't do it.
this. I'm sorry.
what do you mean? Are you serious? Why?
I...
I think I need to be alone.
I'm getting a divorce. - I know you're getting divorced.
I know, but I think I have to do that alone.
Yeah.
I respect that.
you're not ready till you're ready. Don't force it.
that's some yoga shit.
but I like you.
so when you're ready, if you're ready, you call me.
okay?
and sign here and here.
there? - Yeah.
and initial here, sign here.
and...
here, sign, and here. - I like that tie.
Oh, thanks.
is it made out of organic mung beans?
no, actually, I found it digging through your trash.
well, we're divorced.
Yep.
we did it.
we nailed that divorce.
what are you doing right now?
cantonese voices. No respect for when their mouths are actually open.
Oh, my God. I don't think I could focus on it.
you couldn't. It's not sexy, but it's damn funny.
it's beautiful.
I thought you hated it.
never seen it at night.
Hey.
I know we just got divorced, but nobody died, right?
I don't know. It's just...
I was just thinking about how...
you were right.
I don't know what I'm doing.
do you love her?
then it's worth fighting for.
okay.
now I know why you fucking cry all the time.
this shit's emotional. - I've been trying to tell you.
you deserve to be happy.
and I want that for you. Always.
me too.
I love you.
I love you too.
it's late. I'm gonna walk you to your car. - You probably should.
I should. I don't want you to get mugged by someone from the philharmonic.
good idea.
Hey, you've reached Paul. Leave a message.
Hey.
you're probably giving your card to some girl in yoga right now...
but if that doesn't work out for you...
I think I'm ready...
to beat you in Scrabble.
okay.
Hi.
excuse me, sir? - Yeah?
never mind.
I'm so sorry for cutting.
my dog's in the car and he's really thirsty, so thanks.
no problem.
Hi.
[Man Narrating] Listen, here's the thing.
if you can't spot the sucker in your first half hour at the table, then you are the sucker.
guys around here'll tell ya... you play for a living.
it's like any other job. You don't gamble. You grind it out.
your goal is to win one big bet an hour, that's it.
get your money in when you have the best of it, and protect it when you don't.
don't give anything away.
that's how I've paid my way through half of law school.
a true grinder.
see, I learned how to win a little at a time. But finally, I've learned this...
if you're too careful, your whole life can become a fuckin' grind.
this is Teddy KGB's place.
[Man] Five hundred. - You won't find it in the Yellow Pages.
Nope. Not tonight.
no? What?
give me three stacks of high society.
thirty thousand. Count it.
that's good. - So, you're sitting the apple.
good. Want a cookie? - No.
[Narrating] He doesn't look like much, but KGB is connected all the way to the top of the Russian mob.
he's the one guy in the game you don't want to fuck with.
but if you're looking for high stakes, this is the only place in town.
they all know me as a small-timer, but that's about to change.
Joey Knish is a New York legend.
he's been a rounder, earning his living at cards since he was 19 years old.
what are you, holdin' those for somebody?
uh, yeah, I'm holding 'em for you.
you should be. - [Chuckles]
cause I hope you're not thinking of putting all that glimmer in play.
[Narrating] He's as close to a friend as there is in this place.
come here. - [Narrator] But tonight, I don't want to see him.
now, you don't wanna butt onions with these guys.
cause they'll chew you up, take your whole bankroll.
so you say. - There's plenty of easy games.
we get outta here, get some coffee, ride over to that soft seat in Queens.
I know what I'm doing.
you're making a run at it, aren't you?
rolling up a stake and going to Vegas.
I'm right, right?
I can beat the game. - Maybe.
maybe this is a game can be beat.
but you know you can beat the 10-20 at the Chesterfield and the Hi-Low...
at that goulash joint on 79th Street.
okay. I understand.
I understand. Back to battle.
[Narrating] The game in question is No-Limit Texas Hold 'Em.
minimum buy-in $25, 000.
a game like this doesn't come together often outside the casinos.
the stakes attract rich flounders, and they in turn attract the sharks.
No-Limit Texas Hold 'Em is the Cadillac of poker.
each player is dealt two cards face down.
five cards are then dealt face up across the middle.
these are community cards everyone can use to make the best five card hand.
the key to the game is playing the man, not the cards.
bet an eight ball.
there's no other game in which fortunes can change so much from hand to hand.
a brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked, go on tilt...
and lose his mind along with every single chip in front of him.
this is why the World Series of Poker is decided over a No-Limit Hold 'Em table.
some people, pros even, won't play No-Limit.
they can't handle the swings.
but there are others, like Doyle Brunson, who consider No-Limit the only pure game left.
like Papa Wallenda said..."Life is on the wire. The rest is just waiting."
pass it to you.
all right, I raise.
I'm gonna raise five hundred. - [Man] Fold.
it's a position raise. I call it.
[Narrating] Here's the beauty of this game.
go ahead. - [Narrating] I just got top two pair on the flop, and I want to keep him in the hand.
against your average guy, I'd set a bear trap, hardly bet at all.
let him walk into it. But KGB's too smart for that.
so, what I've got to do is over-bet the pot, make it look like I'm trying to buy it.
I bet $2, 000. - Then he plays back at me, and I get paid off.
call.
[Narrating] My guess is Teddy's on a flush draw.
burn and turn.
[Narrating] There's my money card, nine of hearts.
I got a full house.
to the bettor. - Check's good.
[Narrating] Now I hope a spade falls and Teddy makes his flush.
that way he'll bet strong, and I'll beat him with my nines full over aces.
I'm going to bet...
bet...
15000
time.
[Narrating] I want him to think that I'm pondering a call, but all I'm really thinking about is Vegas and the fucking Mirage.
all right, your 15, plus I have another 33 to raise you.
um...
Yeah, I'm gonna go all in, 'cause I don't think you got the spades.
you are right. I don't have spades.
[Narrating] I know before the cards are even turned over.
aces full, Mike.
get up.
come on. Come on.
want some? - No.
I'm down to the felt, Knish. I lost everything.
man, I lost my case money. I lost my tuition.
it happens to everyone. Time to time, everyone goes bust.
you'll be back in the game before you know it.
I'm done. I'm out of it.
they all say that at first.
Hey, man, let me stake you. Standard deal, you know.
fifty percent of your winnings. If you lose, it's on me.
I'd just throw it away.
you still got the truck? - Sure.
come on.
[Mike Narrating] You don't hear much about guys who take their shot and miss, but I'll tell you what happens to 'em.
they end up humping crappy jobs on graveyard shifts, trying to figure out how they came up short.
see, I had this picture in my head.
me sitting at the big table, Doyle to my left, Amarillo Slim to my right, playing in the World Series of Poker.
and I let that vision blind me at the table against KGB.
now, the closest I get to Vegas is west New York, driving this lousy route handed down from Knish...
to rounders who forget the cardinal fuckin' rule...
always leave yourself outs.
Hey, Moogie. - Let me ask you a question.
in a legal sense, can fuckin' Steinbrenner just move the Yankees?
does he have the fuckin' right to just move them?
I don't know. How should I know that?
you didn't learn that yet? - No, we get to Steinbrenner in the third year of law school.
Oh.
take care, man. - Yeah.
[Chattering] - [Poker Chips Clattering]
[Mike Narrating] The judges' game.
I'd heard about it for years on the street, before I was even in law school.
a rotating group of ten or twelve judges, prosecutors and professors.
they all have money, and in my playing days...
it would have been pretty sweet to have any one of them owing me favors.
only problem is, no one can get in the game anymore.
one rounder, Crispy Linetta, sat under some pretense, but they found out he was a pro, he couldn't cross the street without a legal hassle.
even his regular club, Vorshay's, got shut down.
place had been open since 1907.
Oh, Michael.
you got some things for me? - Yes, I do.
put 'em on the desk, it's all right.
kid, he paying you for this late night shit?
Oh, well, knowledge is my reward, sir.
[Chuckles] - Let me tell you, it ain't worth it.
why don't you become a jockey, do something useful.
[Group Laughs] - Kid's a little tall, isn't he, Gene?
enough with the Belmont recruiting spiel. Your bet.
all right. I call. - Michael is lead counsel in the Moot Court you're presiding over next week, Gene.
besides, he could use the background if he's gonna...
clerk for one of you fellas this summer, right?
abe, I thought you liked the kid. Why do you want to make him a civil servant?
Yeah, look... a word to the wise. Stay in the private sector.
that Nassau defense attorney's game? They use our chips for coasters.
[Mike Narrating] The amazing thing is, in this collection of great legal minds, there isn't a single real card player.
I call. - Raise.
um, the professor raises.
Mike? [Whispers] Michael, I would have just called.
no, you're good.
all right, I call.
[Mike Narrating] I don't know if I'm going to bring my legal career to a crashing halt before it even starts, but I just can't help myself.
good. - I'm in.
[Clears Throat] - Read 'em and weep.
threes check.
check to Martin and Lewis over there.
check to the raiser. - Czechoslovakia.
what's the limit? - $20. Big bet's $20.
okay. Good. There's $20.
you've seen half a hand. How the fuck are you betting into us?
you sure this is wise, Abe? It's your money the kid's bettin' with.
it's plenty wise. We know what we're holding, and we know what you're holding.
[Chuckles] The fuck you know what we all got.
summer clerkship in your office says I know what you're holding.
I don't bet with jobs like that.
let's just say I'll put you at the top of the list if you're right.
okay. [Clears Throat] Well, you were looking for that third three, but you forgot that Professor Green folded it on Fourth Street, and now you're representing that you have it.
the D. A. made his two pair, but he knows they're no good.
judge Kaplan was trying to squeeze out a diamond flush, but he came up short, and Mr. Eisen is futilely hoping that his queens are gonna stand up.
so, like I said, the Dean's bet is $20.
well, kiss my ass. - Kiss my ass.
[Group Laughs]
What'd you have, Abe? - Nothin' but a busted straight.
Oh, come on. - It's good enough to win. Take it down.
all right, kid, your first assignment. Pull up a seat next to me.
Oh, I'd like to. I can't, I can't. I don't play cards.
get outta here! - See you tomorrow.
whose deal? - My deal.
I like the kid, Abe. - Good kid.
smart kid.
[Mike Narrating] I tell ya, it's hard leaving that game.
an open invitation to lay with those lambs.
but I'm retired.
the truth is, I can always find games, though.
easy games, tough games, straight games, crooked games, home games.
I can turn this truck onto the Jersey Turnpike and be at the Taj in two hours.
but I've made promises.
I'm just a law student now.
Hello?
Hey. - Hey.
how'd it go? - Oh, great.
[Sighs] I am sick of that fucking route.
don't worry. A few more semesters...
Mmm.
Oh, I gotta go.
I'm really late. - Oh, just stay here. I'll be really quick.
you won't feel a thing. [Chuckles] - [Chuckles]
we both know that's not true.
besides, you should get some sleep.
these fuckin' long nights are killing me.
they never used to.
Yeah, well, that's different. I mean, that was like...
buy in at 8: 00, next thing you know it's morning.
but hey, you know, I think I'm hooked up for this summer.
hooked up how?
well, after I left you last night at the library, I impressed Judge Marinacci.
I think I might be in line for a clerkship.
tell me more.
well, those guys were all playing cards, and...
just hear me out now, hear me out.
they were playing cards and I read his hand blind.
so, instead of coming home, you went and played cards with some judge?
no, I wasn't even playing. They were playing.
I just caught his eye by reading his hand, that's all.
I mean, as long as I don't fuck up Moot Court, I think the job's mine.
what kind of job is that gonna be, Mike?
writing an opinion on high-stakes poker?
honey, you're the one who told me...
that I should use my poker skills in the courtroom.
Yeah, I know I said that, but...
you know what I meant. I meant that you should use your head.
you know, the way you calculate odds on the spot, the way you read people.
that's what I meant. I didn't mean that you should try to con your way into a summer job.
honey, con? I was networking. - [Laughs] Oh, God.
networking. Are you trying to con me now?
no.
I just... I don't think you get it.
you'll be just like one of those ex-college athletes.
you know, great job at the D. A. 's office as long as they never miss a lawyer's league game.
it's true. I just think if you get in this way, you'll always be a hustler to them.
baby, I didn't even play.
okay.
I'll see you later.
Oh.
Hey, hon, can I take the Jeep tomorrow? - Yeah, where?
uh, Worm's gettin' out. I was gonna pick him up.
tomorrow. Beautiful.
I promised I'd be there, hon.
worm. I just can't believe you still know someone called "Worm.
he's like my brother.
shit. I didn't even play.
[Mike Narrating] I met Worm at Dwight Inglewood Preparatory Academy over in Jersey.
we were the only two kids attending who didn't have a trust fund.
my father's office was there. It said "Custodian" on the door.
that's why they took me.
[Makes Buzzer Sound] - Pow!
w-was that, like, your strong finish or something?
motherfucker! - You leave me no choice, the way you play.
that's the fourth time you done played that bitch of spades on my ass.
no, no, no, no, no.
dowling had it three hands ago, and two hands ago I got the black Maria, so I don't want to hear you bitchin', okay?
Yeah, but he shot the moon on that hand, didn't he? - Yeah, I saw that.
so it helped you. - Now... Okay, you're right.
you ain't walking outta here with our grits, Worm.
you know the drill, okay? I'm not gonna smoke 'em. I'll hold on to 'em.
if you want 'em back, you can trade me for 'em, or try to play double or nothing tomorrow.
Murphy! What the hell you sittin' there for? You're processed. Come on.
processed? This motherfucker's gettin' the jump.
come on, man, have some decency here, Worm.
you can buy all the smokes you want in half an hour.
what are you talking about? I won these fair and square. - You don't even smoke, Worm.
Jesus, you guys are such fuckin' babies. You know that?
if you're determined to die of cancer, you really oughta learn how to play cards.
ain't a good idea to add insult to injury, yo.
that shit will come back and hurt you. - You know what?
not in this lifetime. Enjoy your time.
Murphy.
[Mike Narrating] Worm's dad did the grounds, when he wasn't too fuckin' drunk.
that's when we did 'em.
of course, the grounds weren't all we did.
worm put us into a scam a day on all the young aristocrats we went to school with...
selling 'em dime bags of oregano, nunchakus and firecrackers from Chinatown.
Where's the rest? - Kept us in lunch money.
thank you. - Until the time we went for...
more than just pocket change and got caught.
we had the starting five take a dive against Friends Academy.
the point guard snapped and gave Worm up.
they hauled him up before the school board, offered him a deal.
tell us who else was involved, and we'll go easy on you.
worm didn't say a fuckin' word. Got himself expelled.
I stayed in school and graduated. - [Guard] Crank the outside.
[Bell Rings]
not many guys would stand up for a friend like that.
Ta-da! - [Both Laugh]
Mike McD. God. I knew you'd be here. - Aw, man.
you never let me down. - I would have been there every week if you let me, man.
I know, I know. I couldn't let you see me in this shit hole.
look at you. You look great, man. - You too, you too.
did they toughen you up in there? - No, no.
it was a piece of cake. Piece of cake.
man, look at your ride. You've been prospering while I've been away.
what have you been up to? - I borrowed it.
whatever. Just get in it and drive me far away from here.
there's like two whole economies in there... there's cash and there's trade.
so I gotta keep three games going at once, all right?
a game with the white guys, a game with the brothers, and a game with the guards.
and the trick is, I gotta take enough cash off the white guys...
to lose it to the guards so that they keep doing me favors and shit, but I gotta trim enough smokes off the black guys that I can trade and keep myself...
in the style that I've grown accustomed to, and all of this without getting my ass kicked.
so you're working with a partner?
no. Who the hell am I gonna trust in there?
it's just me all alone. - What's this? Come here.
you like that? Isn't that beautiful? - What is that?
it's like an ace up my sleeve. What else?
wait till I show you some of my chops, man. I've gotten pretty blinding.
it's like, it's like, you know... - All right.
it's gonna blow your mind, blow your mind.
you been working? Is your game sharp?
no, man, I'm off it.
what, are you... you gettin' cold cards?
no, man, I mean I quit.
[Laughs] What, are you shitting me? - No, man, l...
I got cleaned out. - Mike McD? You lost?
Yeah, man, l... It was a real blood game over at KGB's place.
you sat down with the Mad Russian and he emptied your pockets?
Yeah. I didn't want to tell you while you were in there.
I didn't want to dispirit you like that.
Jesus, what were you thinking? So, you're just a student now?
what are you doing for money? - I'm driving Knish's truck.
Oh, God, you're killin' me. Mike, Mike, we gotta get you back on the game.
the old partners here, we're gonna run like... - No, no, no, I'm off it.
I mean, I really am done.
you are, huh? All right. I know a game perfect for the two of us.
it's a berry patch right outside New York City... prime pickings.
I'll drop you... I'll drop you off. - Okay.
I mean it. No, I'm really off it. - I know, I know.
this is it, this is it.
so get this, here's the plan. I know this girl Barbara.
she's fuckin' hot. I was this close to bangin' her when they sent me away.
she works as a hostess for all these fuckin' trust fund babies in here.
she got me into their little game.
she introduced me as her cousin from out of town who loves to gamble but wants to learn poker.
that sounds solid. That's a nice hookup.
it's all the way nice. There's only one problem. I got this feeling.
what feeling is that, exactly? - You know this feeling very well.
you know, when you got your table all set. - Uh-huh.
knife, fork, sauce, A-1, Luger's, but... - Yeah.
you just don't have the stake. - Exactly. Glad you understand.
a nickel would start me very nicely.
whoa, Jesus, what have you been livin' on?
I'm livin' a little light, I told you.
anyway, that's $220, so that'll get you started. - $220, I mean...
Hey, thanks, but I mean, that's, like, 11 bets.
I mean, I can't even get a table on this...
good, so forget this game. I'll straighten you out in the city tomorrow.
no way. I gotta get started. [Chuckles]
I mean, I'm already behind here.
you just got out. What's the big fuckin' hurry?
the hurry is, other than you, my friend, there's about five guys, like, eagerly awaiting my release.
how much do you owe? - Like, ten.
ten? - I can't even figure it with the juice.
Hey, look, I can get started on this easy if it's you and me working together.
I heard you asking before, and I hear you asking now, but I can't do that.
I just can't do that. I've made promises.
Hey, you know what? What am I saying? I totally understand, I do.
it's fine. I'll make a couple of moves earlier than I would have normally...
but thanks, I appreciate it. - Premium hands.
I'll catch you in the city tomorrow? - Yeah.
Hey, Mike, man. Fuckin' great to see ya.
you too.
[Mike Narrating] In Confessions of a Winning Poker Player, Jack King said, "Few players recall big pots they have won, strange as it seems, "but every player can remember with remarkable accuracy...
the outstanding tough beats of his career.
seems true to me. 'Cause walking in here,
I can hardly remember how I built my bankroll, but I can't stop thinking of how I lost it.
Mike.
Hi. - Barbara. Worm said you'd be running a little late.
just follow me.
I probably won't even sit. You know, just kinda keep him company.
no, no, that's not gonna work.
here's the play... you're my new boyfriend, you're looking for a regular game.
Really? Well, I'm not much of a card player.
bullshit. Worm tells me that's precisely what you are.
my cut is 25 per cent.
I see. - Good. Come on.
gentlemen.
this is my boyfriend Michael. - [Group] Hello, Michael.
[Barbara] Be nice to him.
leave him enough money to buy me breakfast. - [Laughter]
good luck. - Thanks, sweetie.
here, why don't you pull up a chair.
okay, this one's Chicago. - You know Chicago?
uh, remind me. - Stud game.
high spade in the hole wins half the pot.
okay, well, deal me in, I guess.
that's you. - Oh, thanks.
okay.
that's two on you, Murph. - Oh, yeah. Sorry.
I'm in. - I'm gonna make it five.
Hey, big spender.
[Mike Narrating] Worm and I fall into our old rhythm like Clyde Frazier and Pearl Monroe.
we bring out all the old school tricks, stuff that would never play in the city...
signalling, chip placing, trapping.
we even run the old best hand play. - Raise.
I can probably crack the game just as quickly straight up, but there's no risk in this room.
now, some people might look down on Worm's mechanics, call it immoral.
but as Canada Bill Jones said, "It's immoral to let a sucker keep his money."
like they teach you in One-L...
caveat emptor, pal.
I got the boat, queens over. - [Chuckles]
[Chuckles] He asked you if that stung, Birch.
[Mike Narrating] Worm really has become an artist, too.
discard culls, pickup culls, overhand run ups, the Double Duke...
his technique is flawless. But his judgment is a little off.
a few times, I have to fold the case on him, just so it won't be obvious.
still, he plays the part of the loser to perfection.
flush.
I got the full house. I got the queens over the aces.
ahh, fuck! You know what?
fuck you and your never-ending string of boats, okay? - Hey.
well, my Uncle Les says when the money's gone, it's time to move on, so enjoy it, you secret handshaking assholes.
Murph! Hey, come back any time. Your money's always good here.
[Door Closes] - Good night, Mike. See you next time.
you guys, uh, wanna keep playing?
how'd we do? Oh, beautiful.
fuckin' assholes, they deserved it.
all right, $300, that's your cut.
thank you very much, boys. - Hey, you were great. Great.
when can we do this again? - No, no, it was a one-time thing for me.
just because. - Forget it.
uh, two weeks. - Two weeks? Okay. Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot. Yeah. - [Chuckles]
Hey, I had to try, right?
Bye.
Hey, how'd you know I was coming back?
that's easy. Who's your favorite actor?
Clint Eastwood. The Outlaw Josey Wales, man. The Man with No Name.
he always doubles back for a friend.
[Worm] Hey, we made good time. Wanna get breakfast?
[Mike] No, I gotta get home. If she hasn't already changed the locks on me.
just do me a favor. Give me five minutes.
get me straightened out.
this may not look like Teddy's place, but it ain't the Ivy Leagues either.
so don't fuck around. You gotta play on your belly.
all right. No problem.
Hey, you know I have no problem with the way you help yourself, but these guys are fast company.
they'll spot every move. - Tough customers, huh?
Yeah. I'm serious. - All right.
you won't just get a finger up your spine. - Okay, I hear ya.
I'm playing straight. - [Buzzes]
michael McDermott.
how you doin', Mikey? - Good, how you doin'?
good. You know, um, the computer tried to delete you last week.
Oh, yeah? - But I knew you'd be back.
Oh, no, I'm not back, I just...
it's good to see you. - Good to see you, too.
um, this is Les Murphy. He's like my brother.
call me Worm.
[Phone Rings] - Hey. Don't wiggle away.
Hey, what's she wearing the button for?
they're wired right into the precinct. They got 'em on the payroll.
what are they playing? - Uh, 20-40 forced rotation.
it's the only game going right now.
is that Fat Greggie sitting 20-40? The game's that soft?
Yeah. It's a real live game. So, you guys gonna play?
no. - Hell, yeah, I'm gonna play.
Oh, come on, you're not gonna walk away from this. - Not gonna happen.
Mike, we could cut this room up in an hour.
all right, run along, then. Say hi to her for me.
me, too. - I will. Take care of him.
Jesus. What a fuckin' waste.
do you believe that? She's really got him by the balls.
that's not so bad, is it? - Depends on the grip.
come on, give me $2, 000. - On the finger?
you heard Mike. He's good for it. Come on.
look, I'm gonna triple that in half an hour, princess. Let's go.
okay.
[Keys Jingling, Door Opening]
Hey.
reunion run a little late?
I was gonna call, but I didn't want to wake you up.
it's okay. I wasn't sleeping.
well, why don't you change and we'll get a cab.
um, why don't you just go ahead, and I'm gonna jump in the shower.
and if I miss a little bit of the Mulligan meeting, just cover for me, all right?
Hey.
at least give me a story. You know, I mean...
I mean, tell me you were out drinking till you threw up.
tell me you were getting lap dances over at Scores.
I don't care, just give me something. - I was entertaining Worm.
Uh-huh. - The least I can do for the guy.
so, you were nowhere near a card game. - Sweetie.
what? I'm asking you a question.
I'm just... - No. I was nowhere near a card game.
all right?
all right. I'll wait for you.
I mean, the key is a seamless passing of the baton among the team.
I think the most important thing is to be respectful to the judges but not obsequious.
now, wait a minute. Make sure to be deferential.
gene Marinacci won't buy deferential.
Oh, it's Gene, is it?
well, I knew there was a reason why you were lead counsel, and it's got nothing to do with your punctuality.
sorry. I couldn't find a cab.
anyway, when you make the opening remarks, make sure you stick to the fact pattern.
and use the right cites. Use book cites, not Lexis.
Hi, Jo.
long time. - Knish. How are you?
the same.
I don't mean to interrupt you future magistrates and noblemen, but l, uh, I need a word.
um... - It's important.
okay. Excuse me.
sorry.
I'll act as lead counsel. - It's all right, Kelly.
we were gonna take a break anyway.
coffee time.
the guy's a cheat. He always has been.
right now, he's over at Chesterfield's, ruining your reputation...
with every lousy second he deals.
shit. I told him. Did anybody else see him?
nobody saw... I heard it. Snapping sound gave it away.
I didn't know him, I might not have noticed.
I turn around, and I see him with the mechanic's grip, I know.
you want one? - Did you give him the office?
I tried to warn him, but he looked right through me.
all right, I'll go get him. - No, no, no. He's okay now.
most of those Georges are at the tail end of a 36-hour session.
they can't see straight. Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
but if he's still there when Roman and Maurice start their game, he's gonna wish he was still inside.
I'm gonna go get him.
[Mike Narrating] Amarillo Slim, the greatest proposition gambler of all time, held to his father's maxim...
you can shear a sheep many times, but skin him only once.
gotta bet my jacks.
this is a lesson Worm's never bothered to learn.
[Speaking Russian] - Hey, guys.
english only at the table, no Russian.
what are you talking about? - What am I talking about?
if you want to see this seventh card, you're gonna stop speaking fuckin' Sputnik.
Oh, da, motherfucker. - You're worried we might work together.
I'm sure you're just talking about perogies...
and snow and shit, but let's cut it out, all right?
there's the river, down and dirty.
I think you got that ace, Roman, but I'm gonna pay for it.
okay, well, I got the jacks. Come on.
ace. - Oh, you got it. - And six.
wow, two pair. But I got sevens, too, though.
with my jacks. - Motherfucker, slow rolling me like that.
you said just jacks.
but you made me for the sevens, Maurice. You're a player.
fuck! - Hey, come on! Don't be a fuckin' baby.
Hey, Maurice. - [Together] Hey.
Hey, Mike, you here to play? Come on, we need some new blood.
they're putting a fucking bracelet on me tomorrow for four months.
I already stuck two racks. - Well, have a good rest, man.
can I talk to you for a second, Cosmonaut?
no, man, I'm on a roll. This is a very emotional game.
gotta do it.
[Speaking In Russian] - I counted these.
leave it. It's fine.
[Speaking In Russian]
what's going on? - Where are you at?
I was pumped up eight G's. I was ready to go on a run when you came along.
all right, listen. - Hey, wait, I want a hot dog.
you're in town for five fuckin' minutes, you already got a sign on your back.
Oh, what, that fuckin' Knish rat me out?
you gotta stop listening to that guy, man.
he sees all the angles, but he doesn't have the balls to play one.
Hey, that guy hasn't had to work in 15 years, Worm.
you don't think that's work, what he does?
grinding it out on his fuckin' leather ass? No, thank you.
I thought so, too, all right? Now I know what real work is.
speaking of which, are you even gonna get a job?
or are you just gonna go back to printing those credit cards?
huh? You gonna go away again? - I wasn't printing.
I was distributing. Distributing. It's different, okay?
second of all, I'm never going back there.
stop worrying so much, okay?
come here.
I just want you to think long term, all right? Be smart.
every place in Manhattan, they all keep books, all right?
if you get listed as a mechanic, then not only are you gonna get the shit kicked out of you, you're not gonna get a fuckin' game anywhere in New York.
it's stupid. It's just bad business.
look, this is what I love about you... you think about the big picture.
that's great, okay? But it's not me.
I don't play the game straight up, and then if I lose, go get some real work or something, okay?
I see a mark, I take him down.
that's what I do. That's the way I live.
I know. Listen, you're the guy who taught me all the angles.
but I'm not the guy with my nose open right now. - Aw, come on.
I'm not gonna preach to you, but those two guys in there, they're not rabbits.
Roman and Maurice? They're Russian outfit guys.
not as bad as KGB, but you don't want to be fuckin' with those guys.
with those fake Versace shirts and shit? Jesus.
look, you still got time. Just go back in there, right?
lose their fuckin' money back to 'em, all right?
just make it look good. Just catch a run of real shitty cards.
give it back to 'em. - I can't. I can't.
I gotta put some scratch together, man. I gotta get somethin' going.
then go out to suburbia, man. Play in a fuckin' dentist's game, okay?
go to Swan Meadow, play in the golf pro game. - That's an idea.
I'll definitely do that, but I can't dump to these guys.
you got to.
all right, whatever, whatever.
meet me at Stromboli's in half an hour, all right?
I can't, I gotta go. I have a meeting.
and then I gotta go to fuckin' Queens. I gotta load the truck.
Jesus, man, you're such a fuckin' workin' man now. I'm never gonna see you.
make it look good. I mean it, make it look good. - You know me.
so, how'd you do? - Ah, so-so.
six thousand, two thousand.
Oh, hold on. Two more.
all right, so it's ten grand total, take back the two we lent you, give you the white meat.
you know what?
why don't you give me all of it?
usually, credit players only leave with their profit.
otherwise, the juice starts five points a week on Mike.
Oh, okay. We'll owe you.
[Sighs]
Hey. I've been looking all over for you.
didn't want to be found.
you know, Petrovsky waited and waited. So did the rest of the group.
Jo, look, I missed one meeting. - It's not about the meeting.
I don't care about the meeting. Do you even know why I left this morning?
I found that gangster's roll in your pocket. - It's not what you think.
it's not what you think. - Who do you think I am? You lie right to my face?
look, old days at least you never lied.
you lost everything, but at least you never lied.
Jo, this wasn't even a real game. This was like Wiffle Ball.
can you lose your rent playing Wiffle Ball? - No, I couldn't lose.
that's the point. - No, Mike, you can lose.
I watched you, I stood by you while you lost everything before.
I don't think I can go through that with you again. - Jo, I wasn't gonna lose!
why does this still seem like gambling to you?
why do you think the same five guys make it to the final table at the World Series of Poker every single year?
what are they, the luckiest guys in Las Vegas?
it's a skill game, Jo. - Great. So why'd you have to lie to me?
because I knew you wouldn't understand. - Understand what?
last night, I sat down at this card table.
I felt alive for the first time since I got busted at KGB's joint, okay?
you just told me you felt alive for the first time at a fucking card table.
no, what... - What's that supposed to make me understand?
[Sighs]
[Rock]
midnight, gettin' uptight Where are you - You said you need me but it's quarter to 2: 00 - I heard you was out.
Hey, fuckin' Grama. How you doin'?
I was just thinkin' about you. You know, I could use you. - Oh, yeah?
see me in, like, two weeks. I'll put you back on the payroll.
well, I got some bad news for ya, Worm. I'm out on my own now.
Really? - Yeah.
go figure.
there were a lot of angry people when you went away. A lot of people were mad.
I know, Grama, that's why I'm trying to put together a roll here.
a lot of people coming up to me, asking if I could help, asking if I knew where to find you.
so, it got me to thinkin'. - Really, you thinkin' now? That's big.
Hey, Jesus! Come on! Take it easy.
it's just a friend of mine.
Hey! Easy, easy, easy, easy. God!
get the fuck outta here. What did I say?
Hey, man, take it easy! - Get the fuck outta here!
okay. Here's what I'm thinkin'.
instead of you owing 15 grand spread out to five guys, you owe 25 to me.
what? Where the fuck do you get off? 25 grand?
where the fuck do I get off?
[Grunts] Ohh.
here's how it is. 25 grand, and the juice is still runnin'.
Jesus Christ.
what the fuck are you doin', man? You were my partner.
no, no, I was your lackey.
but I learned a few things, Worm.
I consolidated your outstanding debt.
[Scoffs] Where'd you get the scratch for that?
you've been rolling fags in the Village again. [Grunts]
still a wise ass. Unbelievable. - [Spits]
what I did was go partners with an old friend of yours.
Teddy KGB backed me.
bullshit. Bullshit.
[Spits] Teddy's got plenty of goons.
why would he put you under his flag?
because as soon as he heard your name, he became real excited for the prospect.
what, so you bought me up, Grama? [Scoffs]
Yeah, got a real sweet deal, too. 30 cents on the dollar.
there's not a lot of faith in you out there in the business community.
great, so you're a banker now, Grama. That's really classy.
not exactly. I don't have to tell you my collection methods.
[Sighs] Oh, God. All right, look.
just take it easy, all right?
I'll scrape something together, and I'll find you this week.
that's just what I figured. - No, no, no.
so I'm gonna take what you got on you right now. - Here. Fine.
have yourself a ball, okay?
[Sighs, Chuckles]
[Groans] God!
Damn! [Groans]
excuse me.
mind if I sit?
Michael.
please, please. Sit, sit.
that was a nifty trick the other night.
it was wonderful. - [Chuckles] Thank you.
Marinacci and the D. A. were ready to cut cards for your services at that point.
[Chuckles]
of course, it was an altogether different trick, that disappearing act...
you pulled today at your group's meeting.
Yeah. Well, I figure I owe you an explanation. - Ah, not to me.
I'm sure there's a good reason you left.
you'll just have to work harder. Prepare.
[Chuckles] - And smooth things out with the others.
right. Yeah. Okay.
okay, well, thanks. - Stay. Take a drink.
Jamie? - Yeah?
another glass, darling. - Sure.
what are you drinking? - Gin. Always gin.
here you go. - Thanks, dear.
thank you.
I know a magician doesn't divulge his secrets, but...
[Chuckles] I'm no magician.
well, if it wasn't magic, how did you know what everyone held?
it's a combination of things.
um, I was watching when the cards came out.
that's... That's just an old habit with me, like breathing.
you watch the cards.
I watch the cards also, but I watch the players reacting to the cards.
that's how I knew the D. A. made his two pair, and Judge Kaplan missed the flush.
I was watching their eyes when they checked their river cards.
their faces tell you everything. - You watch the man.
l... I never knew you had to calculate so much at cards.
all right, here's the thing. You only play premium hands.
you only start with jacks or better split, nines or better wired, three high cards to a flush.
if it's good enough to call, you gotta be in there raising, all right?
I mean, tight, but aggressive. And I do mean aggressive. That's your style, Professor.
I mean, you gotta... you gotta think of it as a war.
you are officially never invited to our game again. [Chuckles]
I don't blame you. Put a guy like me in a game like that, the cards don't even matter.
I'll play it blind.
Michael, - May I tell you a story? - Please.
for generations, men of my family have been rabbis.
in Israel, before that in Europe.
it was to be my calling. I was quite a prodigy.
the pride of my yeshiva.
the elders said I had a 40-year-old's understanding...
of the midrash by the time I was 12.
but by the time I was 13,
I knew I could never be a rabbi.
why not?
because for all I understood of the Talmud,
I never saw God there.
you couldn't lie to yourself. - I tried.
tried like crazy.
I mean, people were counting on me.
but yours is a respectable profession.
not to my family.
my parents were destroyed, devastated by my decision.
my father sent me away to New York...
to live with distant cousins.
eventually, l... I found my place, my life's work.
what then?
I immersed myself fully, I studied the minutiae,
I learned everything I could about the law.
I mean, I felt deeply inside that it was what I was born to do.
and did your parents get over it? - No.
I always hoped that I would find...
some way to change their minds, but...
they were inconsolable.
my father never spoke to me again.
if you had to do it all over again, would you make the same choices?
what choice?
the last thing I took away from the yeshiva is this...
we can't run from who we are.
our destiny chooses us.
Hey. L'chayim.
Hey.
Hey, where you been? I've been freezing my ass off.
what happened? - Ah, ran into a door. Don't worry about it.
what happened? - Hey! She crossed her legs too fast, all right?
just mind your own business. - You comin' up?
no, I've been standing out here all this time just to say hi.
listen, things haven't been that smooth on the home front, so tone it down a little, all right?
tone down what, motherfucker? - Great.
never mind. - [Laughs]
when you become a big shot lawyer, could you find us an elevator building?
shut up.
what, did you get robbed?
um, not exactly.
wait, wait, wait. Did she split on you?
[Scoffs] Oh, God.
Oh, my God. Mike, she made off with your sheets.
I always told her she'd be a good card player.
know exactly when to release a shitty hand. - Come on, Mike, forget that.
this girl is obviously wrapped way too tight for living.
no, she was a good... I knew it. I fuckin' knew it.
[Sighs] It's depressing.
you can't trust 'em. You can't trust 'em at all.
I mean, look at you. You domesticated yourself for this girl.
you took yourself out of the life. You walked the fuckin' line for her.
and the minute you want a little of it back, she walks out on you.
it's just like the saying says, you know?
in the poker game of life, women are the rake.
they are the fuckin' rake. - What the fuck are you talking about?
what saying?
I don't know. But there oughta be one.
you know what cheers me up when I'm feelin' shitty? - What?
rolled up aces over kings.
that right? - Yeah.
check raising stupid tourists and taking huge pots off 'em.
yeah? - Stacks and towers of checks I can't even see over.
playin' all night, high-limit Hold' Em at the Taj.
where the sand turns to gold. - Fuck it, let's go.
don't tease me. - Let's play some fuckin' cards.
[Mike Narrating] The poker room at the Mirage in Vegas...
is the center of the poker universe.
Doyle Brunson, Johnny Chan, Phil Helmuth...
the legends consider it their office.
every couple of days a new millionaire shows up...
wanting to beat a world champion.
usually they go home with nothing but a story.
down here, the millionaires are scarce or they're playing craps, but there's still plenty of money for the taking.
in fact, on the weekends you can't get a game in the city, because all the New York rounders are taking care of the tourists here.
Hey, hey, why don't you warm up a seat for me. I'll catch up with you.
what? - Look.
I got certain needs I gotta attend to, okay? - Hey, good.
I mean, I'm overdue. - Good, man, hey, I was startin' to wonder about you.
I thought, maybe, you know, the boys upstate brought about a few changes in you.
Hey, in your dreams, lover.
Hey, Mikey! - Hey. - Hey, Mike.
this is beautiful. Welcome to the Chesterfield south.
ho! - Changing $500.
come all the way to Atlantic City just to see your mugs, huh?
twice in one week.
for someone who don't play, you spend a lot of time in card rooms.
this is what I like to see, huh?
Mike McDermott where he belongs... sittin' with the scumbags.
tellin' jokes, draggin' the occasional pot.
Occasional? Yeah, like my ex-wife occasionally went out with other men.
forget her, Face. I was actually gonna try and make some real money tonight.
but in honor of Mike's alley-like return to the ring,
I'll sit with you all for a while.
Hey, don't do us any favors, Knish.
they're about to go to the board to fill these seats. - Bet it.
I raise. You know, if we wanted to take each other's rolls, we could have just stayed home.
[Mike Narrating] These two have no idea...
what they're about to walk into.
down here to have a good time, they figure...
why not give poker a try?
after all, how different can it be from the home games...
they've played their whole lives?
all the luck in the world isn't gonna change things for these guys.
they're simply overmatched.
we're not playing together, but then again, we're not playing against each other either.
it's like the Nature Channel. You don't see piranhas eating each other, do you?
they wear their tells like signs around their necks.
facial tics, nervous fingers.
a hand over a mouth.
the way a cigarette is smoked.
little unconscious gestures that reveal the cards in their hands.
we catch everything.
if a fish acts strong, he's bluffing.
if he acts meek, he's got a hand. It's that simple.
how are you, you workaholics? - Worm.
good to see ya. Glad you're out.
number's changed, of course.
lotta games this weekend, so you're gonna need the number.
I'll give you a ring. - Hey, Worm?
do they allow people like you in places like this?
Zagosh, when you get yourself a job, then you can be my fuckin' P. O.
how about that?
now, let's get started, shall we?
I'm sorry, sir.
you can't take chips from another player at the table.
we all know each other here.
we're like friends, so if nobody complains, do you have a problem?
it's all right. - No problem.
sir, you have to buy 'em from me. - [Sighs]
fuck this low-limit shit. Can we go get something to eat? I got comped at the noodle bar.
I want to talk to you.
look who's treatin' to a free meal.
don't let that M. S.G. fuck up your head more than it is, Mikey.
you keep grinding out that rent money, Joe. It's noble work you're doing.
so, hey, uh, Nick the Greek.
what's with kitin' my checks?
I'm on empty, that's why. - You are? You're tapped again?
I mean... How much was the hooker?
Mike, please. Relaxation therapist. - [Chuckles]
okay?
it's not where it went. - Wait a minute.
it went to Roman and Maurice?
I told you, man, you didn't have to give it all back to 'em.
I'm Agent Rick Martinez.
let me be the first to welcome you to the CIA.
and this is the story of America's great house of spies.
you've heard of office politics? Ours come with poison pills and guns.
spy trap.
I knew this was going to be a fiasco. I've been assigned to a special covert unit, conceived to go where others can't, and to do what others won't, whether the mission's authorized or not.
we each have our own special skill, Martinez.
I lead, Billy charms people,
Casey hurts people, and you translate.
we are the ODS, last of the old-school spies.
Oh, my God! - Oh! Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!
no, it's, it's okay, I, um...
I spilled coffee all over my suit.
luckily I brought a change of clothes for a reception tonight.
I wasn't looking. You're not leaving, either.
I'm sorry. I'll, I'll go. No, it's okay.
I'm done.
Yeah, it's, uh...
not really appropriate for work, but it's better than wearing a triple latte all day.
so this reception...
you wouldn't happen to have a date? Would you?
Mr. Martinez, are you asking me out? That kinda depends on your answer.
if it's a no, then I was just joking.
is that really how you would ask me out?
by backing into it?
Oh, Mr. Martinez. Be bold.
you know, if someone wants me, I'd like to know.
I'd like someone to say, "I like you,
or "I want to be with you. Let's start with dinner.
okay.
I do like you. And I do want to be with you.
dinner, sometime. No, no. No. No.
dinner. Tonight.
let me think about it.
I'll get back to you.
morning, Martinez. You're late for the meeting in the conference room.
what? I didn't know we had a meeting.
why would you? You weren't invited.
somebody clue me in.
Fay said they'd need an Arabic translator for the morning briefing with Higgins.
the regular guy has food poisoning. Which is what happens when you leave your breakfast burrito unattended in the break room. Did you poison him?
that's neither here nor there. What's important is, they are planning an operation for Paris. And we love Paris.
you know, fay and I got married there. We eloped.
we're all painfully familiar with this story. What's the operation?
does it matter? It's in Paris.
now get in there.
can I help you, Mr. Martinez?
I... You sent for a translator?
what happened to Operative Griffith? I don't know.
are you ready to sacrifice everything to Allah?
Yes, but I want to return to Beirut to see my children first.
you will see them next in heaven, next to Imam Khomeini and Allah.
beirut, Khomeini... It's Hezbollah.
which means Hassan Ohana.
who is he? - The man who coordinated the suicide bombings in Tel Aviv last month. Killed seven Americans.
Hassan is the voice you've been translating, telling the bomber to detonate himself.
and you traced the calls to Paris. We believe he's hiding there.
let's activate a team. Surveillance only.
I want to know with certainty, Ohana is operating out of Paris, before we turn our info over to the French.
I'd like to volunteer the ODS, sir.
this is a delicate operation.
the French distrust us.
in fact, there's been zero cooperation between our agencies since '95, which is when we shut down our field office
does it matter?
what matters is that
french intelligence can never know that we're there.
sir, you of all people know how good the ODS is at flying under the radar.
I strongly suggest that you take this under consideration.
pat me on the back, gentlemen. I just got us a trip to Paris.
great!
our last two missions have been to such hellholes.
finally, a city with good food and deep bathtubs.
you take baths? I enjoy a good soak.
you have a problem with that? - No.
what's the mission? - Surveillance.
we're tracking down a terrorist controller named Hassan Ohana.
what? You know him? We know his work.
hezbollah controller. Mass murderer.
this little vacation just turned serious.
Paris, huh? Oui. I booked the hotel arcole.
same room as our honeymoon.
maybe you could come stay for a couple of days.
you really don't get the concept of divorce, do you?
I had to ask.
it was pretty romantic, though, wasn't it?
our Parisian wedding? You mean our elopement?
wasn't the wedding I wanted. The wedding
I wanted would have included family, bridesmaids, a wedding dress.
but no, we had to have a secret wedding, because you couldn't have your picture taken and be compromised.
you know, from your tone, I'd say you're probably not coming to Paris.
no. Okay.
you know, how about... I pick you up a bottle of that perfume you love so much?
Ooh, I'd love it.
what's it called? The perfume?
Yeah. Remind me.
Oh, I'd rather you remember.
I-I-I don't understand why you're so upset about Paris.
it was our honeymoon.
we were head over heels in love. It was the perfect week.
well, that's one version of the story.
I just don't get it.
no, you obviously don't.
Bye, Michael. Enjoy Paris.
Blanke. Me?
Yeah. What are you doing on the bench? This is my bench.
I'm stuck here; No office, no department.
well, it's depressing. I am aware of that.
I'll tell you what. We're heading overseas for a while.
and you want me to come along. - No.
of course not. But... you can use our bullpen while we're gone. Even my desk, if you like.
Hey. Thanks, man, this could really be a break for me.
people see me at a desk, doing stuff.
it could lead to something. No problem.
but there is something I need you to do for me.
Mm-hmm. You ever been married?
that's a hell of a signal.
figured it would be a lot harder to break into their cell towers and pick up chatter.
probably because we're not using their cell towers.
the CIA has a handful of secret towers all over France.
all right! Who's hungry?
I certainly am.
sorry, chum.
I don't get to eat? You need to monitor phone calls and send them stateside for analysis.
we each have our own special skills, Martinez.
I lead, he charms people, he hurts people, and you translate. We'll bring you a doggie bag.
assuming there are leftovers, which...
is highly unlikely.
Yeah, I think I'm getting the Ravioles Potagres.
I mean, if memory serves, it's fantastic. Just so flavorful.
but the duck is great, too. Fay raved about it during the honeymoon.
what?
can we please be spared reliving the halcyon days of your failed marriage?
I'm just trying to help you two order.
this isn't a second honeymoon.
Hassan is still out there. We're here to hunt a terrorist.
it's serious business.
Garon. Can we see a wine list?
French. English.
French.
Arabic.
it's a keeper.
Merci.
bonsoir, mes vieux amis. Luc.
been a long time. - Yeah.
you wouldn't be here on assignment, would you?
us? No.
just a vacation. Oh, really?
four CIA operatives on vacation.
four operatives? Yes.
we know about your partner. Where is he, by the way?
he's in his room. He's been walloped by the curse of jet lag.
Oh. Is that a fact?
vous pouvez procder.
we know you are American spies.
Hey! Excuse me!
what do you guys want? Don't touch that!
shut up! Get the hell out of here!
very good.
Merci.
it would seem your colleague has been caught with what looks suspiciously like eavesdropping equipment, which now belongs to me. Enjoy your vacation, gentlemen.
it will be my pleasure watching your every move while you appreciate the beauty of Paris.
but I offer this warning:
no more spying.
I would hate to see you all behind bars.
bon apptit.
so anything? - Actually, yes.
we got a hit from the calls we got a voice match, and we're giving it to NSA.
we also got a trace from our cell tower in Paris.
you got an address? 626 Boulevard Jourdan.
got it. Well, that's where the good news ends.
these French have shut down our surveillance and are camped right outside our hotel.
Yeah, it's not sunny this side, either.
the French have already filed a formal complaint. Of course they have.
I want to check out the NSA address, but first we need to shake our tail.
I just want to know who let them know we were coming.
cocktail Barry. Cocktail Barry?
he's a lower level diplomat working for the CIA, and he's been assigned to the embassy here in Paris.
he... he goes to lots of cocktail parties and listens to conversations.
we need to find out if cocktail Barry's been compromised.
I resent his very existence.
now, now, Casey, every man has his niche.
we look for intel under rocks. He looks under champagne flutes.
look alive, Luc.
your targets are on the move.
I need you to get to Paris. Go see the ambassador.
assure him our spying is just conjecture and doesn't need to become a political football.
hold his hand.
tell him it's going to be okay. I'll be on the red-eye tonight.
one other thing I need you to do while you're there.
I'd like you to swap out Operative Martinez's cell phone.
excuse me? You've had one primary task, and that is to figure out a way to use Operative Martinez to help me get information on the ODS.
yet that has been slow in coming.
well, the mission was to win him over.
isn't that about hearts and minds?
hearts and minds.
two things that can become cloudy and confused.
I need information.
crystal clear information.
calls, e-mails, texts.
this is an exact duplicate of his phone.
you are to switch it out with the one he has. Got it?
I-I-I do, but I'm not sure if the opportunity will present itself.
I hired you because you're intelligent and...
...capable.
I have every faith that you can create that opportunity.
there's our man.
sometimes I think we're on the wrong end of the spy game.
and so we're all just standing there, and it's a little more than awkward.
so, finally, I say, "excuse me, minister.
you don't have to apologize for my jacket, but your parakeet better start explaining.
Hello, Barry. A word?
excuse me.
are you insane?
waltzing in here and talking to me out in the open like that?
Yeah, unfortunately, the stealthier option has been removed from the table, Barry.
we're looking for a terrorist here.
french intelligence has been following us since we got to Paris.
Oh, and you led them here.
are you deliberately trying to destroy my career?
don't you get it, Barry? Your career in France is over.
you were the only person in this country with advance knowledge of our arrival.
maybe you let something slip over a bottle of cab sauv.
you know, a little pillow talk.
I understand why you want to brag about us.
it's-it's kind of like being mates with the four tops.
I haven't said a word.
well, then, the French are spying on you.
either way, you're just as blown as we are.
that's impossible. Impossible?
well, we and the man watching this building from across the street would beg to differ.
you don't understand.
I've dedicated 15 years of my life to fix the shattered alliance between the United States and French intelligence communities.
and you cannot imagine how grateful we are, but while you've been playing grab-ass and making froggy friends, you forgot the fact that you're here to spy on these people.
Ugh. Listen to you.
you need to ditch the cold war philosophies, gentlemen.
let's try some progressive thinking here, huh?
in today's world, the United States needs as many allies as it can get.
and, thanks to me, the French are our friends.
and friends don't spy on friends. Is that so?
what are you doing?
Oh, my God! Do you know how expensive that is?!
my bust!
No! Stop it!
No!
No! No...! Don't...!
there's our bug.
what does this say about friendship to you?
I'll tell you what it says-- one minute, the French are shaking your hand; Then, as soon as you turn your back, it's full-on buggery.
just like that, they...
they've ruined me.
I'm done.
almost.
you can still be a spy, Barry-- a real spy
for 15 more minutes. You a good driver, Barry?
I mean, a really good driver.
I'm so sorry.
my accelerator must have become stuck.
morning.
Fay. How are you?
good. You?
great. Busy. Working.
Ah. At a desk.
good.
what?
Oh, it's nothing. It's just... Are you wearing perfume?
smells like Paris.
what's that brand?
you can tell Michael that I am insulted that he thought I'd fall for this. What? Michael?
no, I... I just think you have an alluring scent.
you know, I'm pretty sure that statement falls under sexual harassment.
okay. I'm sorry. Please don't report me.
I already have two strikes.
all right, should be right here on the left.
unbelievable.
NSA can pinpoint it right to the apartment.
we have satellites that can tell if the part in your hair is crooked.
no sign of Hassan.
hope you guys are up on your shots.
this place is a pigsty.
looks like a jihadi sleepover.
anybody smell bleach?
guys.
bleach kills the memory card and erases any fingerprints.
I guess we found Hassan.
what's he saying? He wants to know who we are.
tell him we're his professional dishwashers. God knows he needs them.
he wants us to come out. Tell him not to shoot.
he's reloading.
in a second, he's going to realize that we aren't shooting back.
how are your knife throwing skills?
I'm more of a stabber than a thrower.
what is he doing?
I think he's dead.
I didn't hit him that hard. It wasn't the door that got him.
ricochet, obviously.
are we staying or are we going?
this isn't Hassan; It's just a kid.
well, it's a kid who wanted to kill us.
you know, Hassan, like most controllers, is a loner.
the guys staying here aren't houseguests. Must be a terror cell.
working with Hassan.
hell-bent on targeting Americans in Paris.
which paints a bloody great bull's-eye on the U. S. embassy.
I repeat the question-- are we staying or are we going?
we need help.
we need the French. We stay.
with a suspicious dead body?
interesting choice.
et ils se moquent des forces franaises.
Alors tu les ammnes l'htel, et tu les escortes l'aroport.
Immdiatement. Allez.
a va?
I've been ordered to take you to your hotel where you will pack your bags and be escorted to the airport immediately. - The mission isn't complete.
Hassan is still out there. - Hassan is dead.
it wasn't Hassan in there. That was just some kid.
based on our voice analysis,
Hassan is at least in his 40s.
share that with your supervisors.
my supervisors? But my supervisors think I am an idiot because of that stunt you pulled on me in front of the embassy.
so... thank you for that.
the kid heard us in the kitchen. He knew we were there, so why didn't he just run away? Because he wanted to kill you.
Oh. Controllers don't kill, Luc.
they leave their dirty work to others.
exactly. The real controller-- the real Hassan-- would have ran, but that kid stayed and fought back. Why? Maybe to stop us.
we were getting too close. Too close to finding something.
something in that apartment. That is why... The mission is over!
you Americans... You think you are cowboys.
you rush in, guns blazing-- God bless America-- and then you just walk away and leave your mess for someone else to clean up. Easy, Luc.
no, no, this is not America, this is my country.
and now it is my mess.
how am I supposed to get my kids to soccer practice?
I'm sorry?
Yeah. That was my wife's car you destroyed.
I just paid it off.
so who's going to bring my kids to school now? Hmm?
how am I supposed to get to the market?
I'm not James Bond. I don't get a new Aston Martin with every mission.
you ever think about that, you cowboys?
you're right.
sometimes we can get a bit overly exuberant.
the fact is, we're not James Bond either.
Billy and I carpool to work in my ten-year-old Taurus,
Martinez's car has manual windows, and...
well, not exactly sure how Malick gets to the office.
he just kind of appears.
but, look, whatever's going on between our governments, whatever political bad blood we're all choking on, it doesn't have a damn thing to do with us.
not with the guys in the trenches, trying to do the best we can with the crap that they give us.
but let me tell you something, Luc. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter what flag we're waving or whose bureaucratic ass we're kissing, we both want the same thing.
and we're sorry about your car.
you sure Hassan is still out there? - Yes.
and whatever that kid was hiding in the apartment could lead us to him.
so, come on, Luc.
they're not gonna look for him, but we can.
antiterrorism is in charge of the case.
it's out of my hands.
they will be investigating his apartment for at least another two hours.
I'll pick you up in three.
I recommend you get something to eat.
could be a very long night.
Wha...?
deputy director.
what are you doing here?
well, I came all the way to Paris to tell you...
Yes.
I'll go out with you. Actually, I was here anyway, but the answer is still the same.
the thing is, I already made plans with the guys.
well, will any of them be dressed like this?
let me make a phone call.
so, where did you go to college?
no.
you didn't go to college?
no, meaning I refuse to answer that question.
we're on our first date. In Paris.
no one knows us here.
except the various people you have trailing you.
I say let's step it up.
no college talk, no talk about smothering parents or favorite books or unrealized life dreams.
it's all just filler...
till we get to the good stuff.
let's get to the good stuff.
would you like me to start?
sure.
I'm... spontaneous.
I'm silly, sometimes.
I like a good laugh and a great kiss.
and I'm quite confident that if we were to have sex, it would blow...
your... mind.
it's your turn.
wow me.
okay.
wait, you gonna tell me a secret?
no.
I could work with that.
give me your phone.
I'm gonna give you my personal cell number.
are you gonna take my calls?
no.
but you can try.
there's nothing here.
what did you expect to find? A diary with his plans?
o ye of little faith, Luc.
hello there.
can you stop that?
Michael, we're supposed to work here.
because they use it for storage.
work visas. Nice work, townsend.
the visas the ODS found in Ohana's apartment belonged to a group of men who are part of a Hezbollah terror cell.
circling our embassy, no doubt.
we believe this man is Hassan Ohana.
Qaudir Ben Ali.
sir, the teleconference is set up.
this is fantastic. Have we shared all this with the French?
Yes. And we have the NSA figuring out coordinates.
sharing intel with our allies, working together.
we can have a tactical victory and a political one.
director Renard.
I understand you have in your possession the intelligence my and your operatives collected? Yes.
based on the documents you've given us, we can use cell towers to triangulate their calls and confirm their location.
splendid. There is one problem.
our cell towers are down.
might it be possible to borrow yours?
well, wouldn't that presume that we have cell towers in Paris?
it most certainly would.
I would be most happy to give you the coordinates to our cell towers.
they believe Hassan is in one of the apartments on the second floor.
okay, so please don't tell me your plan is to bash down every door on the second floor. Of course not.
terrorists like Hassan-- they hear we are near, they blow themselves up, along with anyone else in the building.
tous au deuxime.
this, this is an EMP pulsator. Allez-y.
it fires a high-frequency radio burst that burns out... It disables all cell phones and detonators within a small radius. We know, we invented it.
no, no, no, no. The French invented them.
who bloody cares? We have one.
so you take out Hassan's detonators, cell phones
no explosions. Good plan. Vive la France.
let's get on with it.
okay... Attendez mon signal.
Allez-y.
now.
that... was not supposed to happen. Actually, I think the French did invent it.
Luc, what the hell are your guys doing?
falling back. With no lights, the crowd
it's too-too dangerous to go in.
what is it with you people always surrendering?
all right, let's split up.
no time for thinking, son.
are you good? Actually, I'm in a great deal of pain.
go!
nice takedown.
high praise from the master.
america, here you are, basking in the afterglow of a job well done.
Thanks, Luc, for everything.
you guys were actually somewhat helpful.
well, our mission has been accomplished, and finally, we showed the world that the French and the American can work together.
I'm Scottish. Luc, it's great working with you on this one. Someone else might not have been as generous.
I'm glad to work with the ODS, Michael.
you know what? I have no more doubts.
you are the most intelligent... Brave...
strong...
and handsome agents the states has to offer.
please distribute those compliments among yourselves.
bon voyage!
welcome back, Miss Ferrer.
and congratulations on a job well done.
that's very kind of you, sir, but I really didn't do much.
Oh, it's not how much you do, it's that you do your part well.
the CIA is a vast machine that depends on each cog turning in unison with the next.
Hassan has been put out of commission, our relations with the French are better than ever.
Yes, sir, I'd have to say that this entire affair has been an unqualified success.
it is unqualified, isn't it, Miss Ferrer?
I swapped out Martinez's phone as you asked.
so, the next time the ODS decides to fly under the radar, I'll be flying with them.
Yes, siree, this has been one sweet day.
all right, proud patriots, you know the drill.
check everything in your bags: Electronics, shoes, toiletries.
toiletries? Seriously?
the French have no boundaries when it comes to bugging our intimate regions.
I once found a microphone in my man groomer.
security already scanned all of this stuff.
if I know Luc, he went above and beyond, which is why we are gonna go above standard operating procedure.
it doesn't bother you that Luc might have bugged us?
bother us? Martinez, Luc is a spy.
a sweeter man, you will not meet, but a spy nonetheless, as are we.
which is why I would be offended if he didn't bug us.
particularly after we bugged him.
I think we got ourselves a winner.
your cell phone's been bugged.
you've been officially initiated into the spy versus spy game.
Oh. How was Paris?
successful mission, but I did miss you.
Yeah, sure. No, I did.
you remembered.
not exactly, but I remembered the dinner at the hotel our first night.
you came in in the most devastating dress.
the one that we bought at the local designer shop that day.
I mean, it didn't look that good in the window
I can tell you that much
but it was blue, deep blue, and I was... I was gone.
and then you remembered the perfume.
Oh, no, no. I dug the dress out of storage and had it tested in the lab to determine the perfume on it.
the lab.
how romantic.
thank you.
all right.
well done back there in Paris. The ODS are good.
all that tooting their own horns
apparently, it's justified.
what's wrong?
I don't think this-- us-- will work.
what? Why?
do you want me to be honest? Yes.
you see? There's the problem. I'm not a very honest person.
in fact, I'm not very trustworthy either.
look, I know who I am, and I am a person who does what's best for me before everything else, including the truth.
I'm not easily chased off.
I would just chew you up and spit you out.
Oh, yeah?
I might surprise you.
I might just bite back.
no, I'm sorry.
Oh, okay. Uh... yeah. Well...
I'm sorry, too.
is that a new phone?
uh, yeah. The French bugged my other one.
can you believe it? What did you do with it?
the old phone? Yeah.
destroyed it.
good.
Mr. Martinez, I wasn't done with this conversation.
Oh! Sorry.
you know, just last week, I was reading in a very important medical journal...
...that some children are allergic to chocolate.
makes their noses itch.
maybe I'm not allergic.
I could try a piece.
Really?
but why take a chance?
Mr. Wonka? Mr. Wonka?
we're headed for a tunnel. - Oh, yeah.
full speed ahead.
how can they see where they're going? - They can't.
there's no knowing where they're going.
switch on the lights!
people, keep an eye out.
we're passing some very important rooms here.
what do you use hair cream for?
to lock in moisture.
whipped cream. - Precisely.
that doesn't make sense.
for your information, little girl...
...whipped cream isn't whipped cream at all unless it's been whipped with whips.
everybody knows that.
stop the boat. I wanna show you guys something.
now, this is the most important room in the entire factory.
now, everyone, enjoy yourselves, but just don't touch anything.
okay? Go on.
go on, scoot.
Hey, Mr. Wonka, what's this?
let me show you.
thank you.
these are Everlasting Gobstoppers.
they're for children who are given very little allowance.
you can suck on it all year, and it'll never get any smaller.
lsn't that neat? - It's like gum.
no. Gum is for chewing.
if you tried chewing one of these Gobstoppers...
...you'd break all your little teeth off.
but they sure do taste terrific.
and this is Hair Toffee.
you suck down one of these little boogers...
...and in exactly half an hour...
...a brand-new crop of hair will grow out over the top of your little noggin.
and a mustache. And a beard.
who wants a beard? - Well...
...beatniks, for one. Folk singers and motorbike riders.
you know, all those hip, jazzy, super-cool, neat, keen and groovy cats.
it's in the fridge, daddy-o. Are you hep to the jive?
can you dig what I'm laying down? I knew you could.
slide me some skin, soul brother.
unfortunately, the mixture isn't right yet.
because an Oompa-Loompa tried some yesterday, and, well, he
how are you today?
you look great.
watch this.
you mean that's it?
do you even know what "it" is?
it's gum. - Yeah.
it's a stick of the most amazing and sensational gum in the whole universe.
know why? Know why?
because this gum is a full three-course dinner all by itself.
why would anyone want that?
it will be the end of all kitchens and all cooking.
just a little strip of Wonka's magic chewing gum and that is all you will...
...ever need at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
this piece of gum happens to be tomato soup, roast beef and blueberry pie.
it sounds great.
lt sounds weird. - lt sounds like my kind of gum.
I'd rather you didn't. There are still some things that are...
I'm the world-record holder in chewing gum. I'm not afraid of anything.
how is it, honey? - It's amazing!
tomato soup. I can feel it running down my throat.
Yeah. Spit it out.
young lady, I think you'd better-- - It's changing.
roast beef, with baked potato.
crispy skin and butter.
keep chewing. My little girl's gonna be the first person to have a chewing-gum meal.
Yeah. I'm just a little concerned about the...
blueberry pie and ice cream!
that part. - What's happening to her nose?
it's turning blue.
your whole nose has gone purple.
what do you mean?
violet, you're turning violet.
what's happening? - Well, I told you I hadn't quite got it right.
because it goes a little funny when it gets to the dessert.
it's the blueberry pie that does it.
I'm terribly sorry.
mother? What's happening to me?
she's swelling up.
like a blueberry.
I've tried it on, like, 20 Oompa-Loompas, and each one ended up as a blueberry.
it's just weird.
but I can't have a blueberry as a daughter.
how is she supposed to compete?
you could put her in a county fair.
Yeah, yeah
yeah
listen close, and listen hard
to the tale of Violet Beauregarde
this gentle girl She sees no wrong
in chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing
chewing, chewing all day long
chewing, chewing all day long
chewing, chewing all day long
chewing, chewing all day long
yeah
she goes on chewing till, at last
her chewing muscles grow so vast
and from her face Her giant chin
sticks out just like a violin
chewing, chewing all day long
chewing, chewing all day long
chewing, chewing all day long
for years and years she chews away
her jaws get stronger every day
and with one great, tremendous chew
they bite the poor girl's tongue in two
and that is why we try so hard
to save Miss Violet Beauregarde
chewing, chewing all day long
chewing, chewing all day long
chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing
chewing, chewing all day long
chewing, chewing all day long
chewing, chewing all day long
chewing, chewing all day long
Mr. Wonka!
I want you to roll Miss Beauregarde into the boat...
...and take her along to the Juicing Room at once, okay?
juicing Room? What are they gonna do to her there?
they're gonna squeeze her.
like a little pimple.
we gotta squeeze all that juice out of her immediately.
mother, help me.
please.
come on.
let's boogie.
without the boat, we'll have to move double-time to keep on schedule.
there's far too much to see.
Mr. Wonka? - Yeah?
why did you decide to let people in?
so they could see the factory, of course.
but why now? And why only five?
what's the special prize, and who gets it?
the best kind of prize is a surprise.
will Violet always be a blueberry?
no. Maybe. I don't know.
that's what you get from chewing gum all day. It's disgusting.
if you hate gum so much, why do you make it?
once again, you shouldn't mumble. It's starting to bum me out.
can you remember the first candy you ever ate?
no.
in fact, Willy Wonka did remember the first candy he ever ate.
I'm sorry, I was having a flashback.
I see.
these flashbacks happen often?
Increasingly...
...today.
this is a room I know all about.
for you see, Mr. Wonka, l, myself, am in the nut business.
are you using the Havermax 4000 to do your sorting?
no.
you're really weird.
squirrels. - Yeah. Squirrels.
these squirrels are specially trained to get the nuts out of shells.
why use squirrels? Why not use Oompa-Loompas?
because only squirrels can get the whole walnut out almost every single time.
see how they tap them with their knuckles to make sure it's not bad?
Oh, look. Look.
I think that one's got a bad nut.
daddy, I want a squirrel.
get me one of those squirrels. I want one.
Veruca, dear, you have many marvelous pets.
all I've got at home is one pony and two dogs and four cats and six bunny rabbits...
...and two parakeets and three canaries and a green parrot and a turtle...
...and a silly old hamster. I want a squirrel!
all right, pet.
daddy will get you a squirrel as soon as he possibly can.
but I don't want any old squirrel, I want a trained squirrel.
very well.
Mr. Wonka, how much do you want for one of these squirrels?
name your price.
Oh, they're not for sale. She can't have one.
daddy.
I'm sorry, darling.
Mr. Wonka's being unreasonable.
if you won't get me a squirrel, I'll get one myself.
Veruca.
little girl?
Veruca, come back here at once.
Veruca.
little girl?
don't touch that squirrel's nuts.
it'll make him crazy.
I'll have you.
Veruca.
Veruca.
No!
Veruca!
let's find the key.
Nope. Not that one.
daddy! - Veruca!
no. It's not that one.
there it is.
there it isn't.
daddy, I want them to stop.
what are they doing?
they're testing to see if she's a bad nut.
Oh, my goodness. She is a bad nut after all.
Veruca!
daddy!
where are they taking her?
where all the other bad nuts go. To the garbage chute.
where does the chute go?
to the incinerator.
but don't worry. We only light it on Tuesdays.
today is Tuesday.
well, there's always the chance they decided not to light it today.
now, she may be stuck in the chute just below the top.
if that's the case, all you have to do is just reach in and pull her out.
okay?
Veruca Salt, the little brute
has just gone down the garbage chute
and she will meet, as she descends
a rather different set of friends
a rather different set of friends
a rather different set of friends
a fish head, for example, cut
this morning from a halibut
an oyster from an oyster stew
a steak that no one else would chew
and lots of other things as well
each with its rather horrid smell
horrid smell
these are Veruca 's newfound friends
that she will meet as she descends
these are Veruca 's newfound friends
who went and spoiled her, who indeed?
who pandered to her every need?
who turned her into such a brat?
who are the culprits?
who did that?
the guilty ones, now this is sad
are dear old Mum and loving Dad
Oh, really? Oh, good.
I've just been informed that the incinerator's broken.
so there should be about three weeks of rotten garbage to break their fall.
well, that's good news.
Yeah.
well, let's keep on trucking.
I don't know why I didn't think of this.
the elevator's by far the most efficient way to get around the factory.
there can't be this many floors.
how do you know, Mr. Smarty-Pants?
this isn't just an ordinary up-and-down elevator, by the way.
this elevator can go sideways, longways, slantways...
...and any other ways you can think of.
you just press any button and, whoosh, you're off.
Oh, look. Look.
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Fudge Mountain.
I'd rather not talk about this one.
this is the Puppet Hospital and Burn Center.
it's relatively new.
the administration offices.
Hello, Doris.
why is everything here completely pointless?
candy doesn't have to have a point.
that's why it's candy.
it's stupid.
candy is a waste of time.
no son of mine is going to be a chocolatier.
then I'll run away.
to Switzerland. Bavaria.
the candy capitals of the world.
go ahead.
but I won't be here when you come back.
sorry, son.
we're closing for the night.
I wanna pick a room.
go ahead.
here.
put these on quick, and don't take them off whatever you do.
this light could burn your eyeballs right out of your skulls.
and we certainly don't want that, now, do we?
this is the testing room for my very latest and greatest invention:
television Chocolate.
one day it occurred to me:
Hey, if television can break up a photograph...
...into millions and millions of tiny pieces and send it whizzing through the air...
...then reassemble it on the other end...
...why can't I do the same with chocolate?
why can't I send a real bar of chocolate through the television, ready to be eaten?
I'm not gonna touch it. I'm not going in that direction.
sounds impossible.
it is impossible.
you don't understand anything about science.
first off, there's a difference between waves and particles.
second, the amount of power it would take to convert energy in matter...
...would be like nine atomic bombs.
Mumbler!
seriously, I cannot understand a single word you're saying.
okey-dokey.
I shall now send a bar of chocolate from one end of the room...
...to the other by television.
bring in the chocolate.
it's gotta be real big because you know how on TV...
...you can film a regular-size man, and he comes out looking this tall?
same basic principle.
it's gone.
told you. That bar of chocolate is now rushing through the air above our heads...
...in a million tiny little pieces.
come over here. Come on. Come on. Come on!
watch the screen.
here it comes.
Oh, look.
take it. - It's just a picture on a screen.
scaredy-cat.
you take it.
go on. Just reach out and grab it.
go on.
holy buckets.
eat it. Go on.
it'll be delicious. It's the same bar.
it's just gotten a little smaller on the journey, that's all.
it's great.
it's a miracle.
so imagine, you're sitting at home watching television...
...and suddenly a commercial will flash onto the screen, and a voice will say:
Wonka's chocolates are the best in the world.
if you don't believe us, try one for yourself.
and you simply reach out and take it.
how about that?
so can you send other things?
say, like, breakfast cereal?
do you have any idea what breakfast cereal's made of?
it's those little curly wooden shavings you find in pencil sharpeners.
but could you send it by TV if you wanted to?
of course I could. - What about people?
well, why would I wanna send a person? They don't taste very good at all.
don't you realize what you've invented? It's a teleporter.
it's the most important invention in the history of the world.
and all you think about is chocolate.
calm down, Mike.
I think Mr. Wonka knows what he's talking about.
no, he doesn't. He has no idea.
you think he's a genius, but he's an idiot.
but I'm not.
Hey, little boy.
don't push my button.
he's gone.
let's go check the television, see what we get.
I sure hope no part of him gets left behind.
what do you mean?
well, sometimes only half of the little pieces find their way through.
if you had to choose only one half of your son, which one would it be?
what kind of a question is that?
no need to snap. Just a question.
try every channel. I'm starting to feel a little anxious.
there he is. - Mike.
the most important thing
that we've ever learned
the most important thing we've learned as far as children are concerned
is never, never let them near the television set
or better still just don 't install the idiotic thing at all
never, never let them
never, never let them
never, never let them
it rots the senses in the head
it keeps imagination dead
it clogs and clutters up the mind
it makes a child so dull and blind
so dull, so dull
he can no longer understand a fairy tale, a fairyland
a fairyland, a fairyland
his brain becomes as soft as cheese
his thinking powers rust and freeze
he cannot think, he only sees
regarding little Mike Teavee
we very much regret that we
regret that we
shall simply have to wait and see
wait and see, wait and see
wait and see, wait and see, wait and see
we very much regret that we
shall simply have to wait and see
if we can get him back his height
but if we can 't
it serves him right
somebody grab him.
help me.
help me.
Oh, thank heavens. He's completely unharmed.
unharmed? What are you talking about?
just put me back in the other way.
there is no other way.
it's television, not telephone. There's quite a difference.
and what exactly do you propose to do about it?
I don't know.
but young men are extremely springy. They stretch like mad.
let's go put him in the taffy puller. - Taffy puller?
Hey, that was my idea.
boy, is he gonna be skinny.
Yeah.
taffy puller.
I want you to take Mr. Teavee and his...
...Iittle boy up to the taffy puller, okay?
stretch him out.
on with the tour.
there's still so much left to see.
now, how many children are left?
Mr. Wonka, Charlie's the only one left now.
you mean, you're the only one?
Yes.
what happened to the others?
Oh, my dear boy, but that means you've won.
Oh, I do congratulate you. I really do.
I'm absolutely delighted.
I had a hunch right from the beginning. Well done.
now, we mustn't dilly or dally.
we have an enormous number of things to do before the day's out.
but luckily for us, we have the great glass elevator to speed things along.
speed things along.
come on.
up and Out? What kind of room is that?
hold on.
Oh, my goodness.
we're gonna need to go much faster, otherwise we'll just never break through.
break through what?
I've been longing to press that button for years.
well, here we go. Up and out.
but do you really mean--? - Yeah. I do.
but it's made of glass.
it'll smash into a million pieces.
Augustus, please don't eat your fingers.
but I taste so good.
look, Mother. I'm much more flexible now.
Yes, but you're blue.
daddy, I want a flying glass elevator.
Veruca, the only thing you're getting today is a bath, and that's final.
but I want it.
where do you live?
right over there. That little house.
what time do you think they'll be back?
hard to know, dear.
I think there's someone at the door.
Hi, Mom.
mom. Dad. We're back.
Charlie. - Charlie.
goodness.
this is Willy Wonka. He gave us a ride home.
I see that.
you must be the boy's...
parents? - Yeah. That.
he says Charlie's won something.
not just some something.
the most "something" something of any something that's ever been.
I'm gonna give this little boy my entire factory.
you must be joking.
no, really. It's true.
because you see, a few months ago, I was having my semiannual haircut...
...and I had the strangest revelation.
in that one silver hair...
...I saw reflected my life's work...
...my factory, my beloved Oompa-Loompas.
who would watch over them after I was gone?
I realized in that moment:
I must find a heir.
and I did, Charlie.
you.
that's why you sent out the golden tickets.
what are Oompa-Loompas?
I invited five children to the factory...
...and the one who was the least rotten would be the winner.
that's you, Charlie.
so, what do you say?
are you ready to leave all this behind and come live with me at the factory?
sure. Of course.
I mean, it's all right if my family come too?
Oh, my dear boy, of course they can't.
you can't run a chocolate factory...
...with a family hanging over you like an old, dead goose. No offense.
none taken, jerk.
a chocolatier has to run free and solo.
he has to follow his dreams. Gosh darn the consequences.
look at me.
I had no family, and I'm a giant success.
so if I go with you to the factory, I won't ever see my family again?
Yeah. Consider that a bonus.
then I'm not going.
I wouldn't give up my family for anything.
not for all the chocolate in the world.
Oh, I see.
that's weird.
there's other candy too besides chocolate.
I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka. I'm staying here.
well, that's just...
...unexpected...
...and weird.
but I suppose, in that case, I'll just
goodbye, then.
sure you won't change your mind?
I'm sure.
okay. Bye.
things are going to get much better.
and for once, Grandma Georgina knew exactly what she was talking about.
the next morning, Charlie helped his parents fix the hole in the roof.
grandpa Joe spent the whole day out of bed.
he didn 't feel tired at all.
Charlie 's father got a better job at the toothpaste factory...
...repairing the machine that had replaced him.
things had never been better for the Bucket family.
the same could not be said for Willy Wonka.
I can't put my finger on it.
candy's the only thing I was ever certain of...
...and now I'm just not certain at all.
I don't know which flavors to make or which ideas to try.
I'm second-guessing myself, which is nuts.
I've always made whatever candy I felt like, and l...
that's just it, isn't it?
I make the candy I feel like, but now I feel terrible, so the candy's terrible.
you're very good.
pity about that chocolate fellow, Wendell-- Walter.
Willy Wonka. - That's the one.
says here in the paper his new candies aren't selling very well.
but I suppose maybe he's just a rotten egg who deserves it.
Yep. - Oh, really?
you ever met him?
I did.
I thought he was great at first, but then he didn't turn out so nice.
he also has a funny haircut.
I do not!
why are you here? - I don't feel so hot.
what makes you feel better when you feel terrible?
my family.
what do you have against my family?
it's not just your family. It's the whole idea of
they tell you what to do, what not to do...
...and it's not conducive to a creative atmosphere.
usually they're just trying to protect you because they love you.
if you don't believe me, you should ask.
ask who? My father?
no way.
at least, not by myself.
you want me to go with you?
Hey. Hey, what a good idea. Yeah!
and you know what? I've got transport.
I have to be more careful where I park this thing.
I think we've got the wrong house.
do you have an appointment?
no. But he's overdue.
open.
now, let's see what the damage is, shall we?
heavens.
I haven't seen bicuspids like these since...
since...
Willy?
Hi, Dad.
all these years...
...and you haven't flossed.
not once.
it was on this day that Willy Wonka repeated his offer to Charlie...
...who accepted on one condition.
sorry we're late. We were brainstorming.
thought I heard thunder.
you staying for dinner, Willy? - Yes, please.
I'll shuffle the plates.
you smell like peanuts.
I love peanuts. - Oh, thank you.
you smell like...
...old people and soap.
I like it.
elbows off the table, Charlie.
how do you feel about little raspberry kites?
with licorice instead of string.
boys, no business at the dinner table. - Sorry, Mom.
I think you're on to something, though, Charlie.
in the end, Charlie Bucket won a chocolate factory.
but Willy Wonka got something even better:
a family.
and one thing was absolutely certain:
life had never been sweeter.
once upon a time, there were three young women who got into very big trouble.
the first was a park avenue princess turned thief.
the second was a marine decorated for valor, court-martialed for a deadly mistake.
and the third was a dedicated police detective turned dirty cop.
they each made mistakes, but i gave them a second chance.
and now they work for me.
my name is charlie.
her name is sarah daniels.
she's being held captive in a room somewhere in the falcon hotel.
a notorious child trafficker known as "pajaro" is attempting to sell her.
you have to find sarah before it's too late.
sorry! i managed to kill your martini and mortally wound your shirt.
it's not, uh, it's not fatal.
can i buy you a drink?
Yeah, i am--i am such a klutz, i'd probably spill it.
one fashion emergency is enough for tonight.
take good care of her. i won't be long.
Thanks.
okay, ladies. time to fly.
you bug mackal's phone?
with one hand behind my back. you in position?
almost.
headed towards the service area now.
Gloria, has the buyer's rep touched down?
walking off his g6 as we speak.
welcome to miami, mr. fisk. - thank you.
I got fisk. i'm leaving the airport now, kate.
Abby, get bosley in position.
I'm on it.
bosley! adult swim is over.
excuse me, ladies. duty calls.
text me ?
I'm meeting pajaro's broker in 20 minutes to pick up the package.
I'll e-mail you a picture now.
I think you'll approve.
bosley, you all ready?
okay, gloria. i'm wired in.
bug is active. i'm ready to track the calls.
okay, i'm going off-road.
what are you doing?! where do you think you're taking me?!
Where's pajaro's broker keeping the girl?
I don't know, i swear.
okay! okay! the falcon hotel!
I'm meeting him at the bar-- a guy named mackal.
once it's confirmed by boss' wire transfer, he'll give me instructions how to get the package out of the hotel.
she's not a package.
her name is sarah. she's 16 years old.
I-I'm just the middle man. i'll do anything.
you're gonna make a phone call, and you better be oscar-worthy.
it's fisk. the--the limo never showed. i'm jumping in a cab.
I'll let my guys know.
he's calling the hotel room. locking down the signal.
Yeah.
sit tight. buyer's rep is running late.
I got it.
he called room 2819.
get visual confirmation sarah's in the room.
satellite camera coming online.
okay, you got three guys in the room.
they look heavily armed.
Sarah's on the bed. she's bound and gagged.
okay, abby, ready to do some housekeeping?
dropping in now.
who is it? - room service.
let's go.
Shh. it's okay.
you're safe.
okay. there we go.
who are you?
you don't look like cops.
we're not.
we're angels.
I spoke to sarah's parents, angels.
they are incredibly relieved to have her back safe and sound.
well, now that mackal's been hiding behind an army of lawyers, what are the chances he'll flip on his boss pajaro?
it's doubtful mackal's even met him.
you do realize the irony of that coming from you, right, charlie?
Oh, miami p. d.'s been trying to nail pajaro for years.
he doesn't leave any footprints, electronic or otherwise.
he's a ghost.
ghosts aren't real. this guy is and he needs to pay.
don't lose sight of what you accomplished tonight.
Sarah's safe because of you three.
and, of course, you, bosley.
good night, angels.
good night, charlie.
okay, time to get the party on. i'm serious.
I'm gonna have to pass.
I, uh, got a previous engagement.
pool babes?
good night.
okay, well, where are we celebrating?
uh, tidepool, ripcord?
or if we go to the deck, i can score us a v. i.p. table.
sounds good. - oh. is your favorite bartender working tonight?
what? he's single, he's straight, and he has a life plan.
mixing mojitos.
no. he is saving his money to buy a boat and sail around the world.
that is a plan.
you do realize that is not a life plan.
okay, fine. he's a dreamer, and that's sexy.
please, please, come with me.
actually, guys, i think i'm going to skip the velvet rope tonight.
no, you're not. come on. you're coming with us. let's go.
no. no, no, no, no. really, really. i-i'm completely beat.
you guys go. go and have a margarita for me.
we will have two margaritas for you.
you're missing out.
I found these in your trash.
when you said your dad was reaching out you didn't say it was a full-blown letter writing campaign.
the great white shark of wall street can be relentless, even in captivity.
and i threw them in there for a reason, detective.
good night. i'll catch you ladies tomorrow.
it is tomorrow.
come on. it's your dad.
I used to steal warhols to get that man's
please tell me she's not really gone...
and that i'm just gonna wake up and see her again.
you know, i-i never thought my heart could...
hurt this much.
she doesn't even have any family that we can call.
we were her family.
she was our sister.
how's charlie?
devastated.
losing an angel is his worst nightmare.
it's mine, too.
we're gonna find out who did this.
if it's the last thing we do.
they just walked in. hold on a second.
can we have the room?
Phil, let's get out of here.
clear the room.
okay, charlie.
bosley updated me. thank god you're okay.
who were those people?
it's just a precaution.
they're sweeping the agency.
I sent teams to your homes as well.
you think we're being targeted?
I can't confirm that you're not.
Gloria was family, and her murder is our most personal case.
I need to know you're up for the fight.
bring it on.
just remember, you're angels of justice, not angels of vengeance.
check this out.
I gave the cops access to all of our security cameras, except these.
sending it to you now.
this is half an hour before you guys left the building.
check out the woman on the motorcycle scoping gloria's car.
she split right after the explosion, didn't call 9-1-1 or stick around and wait for the police and talk to them. she just... took off.
what's that's shadow on the back of her neck?
look at the ink.
same as gloria's.
means they were members of the same car boosting crew.
I don't get it. gloria waved good-bye to that life when she enlisted with uncle sam.
bos, run her face against the miami-dade auto theft database.
log in under detective ray goodson, badge 4-1-9-7-6.
you're ex-fiance?- yes.
guess i can take impersonating a police officer off my bucket list. password?
always uses his birthday.
access granted.
Eve french-- pleaded no contest to grand theft auto and manslaughter in '05.
stole a lamborghini, got into a high-speed chase, ended up... hitting a cab and killing the driver.
did four years at tallahassee women's correctional.
how long she been back in miami?
paroled six months ago.
lives on a houseboat, biscayne marina.
why would she want gloria dead?
let's go ask her.
whoa, whoa. remember what charlie said.
what? these are just conversation starters.
guys.
just...be careful.
for me.
okay, calm down. we just wanna talk.
try knocking next time.
why did you kill gloria? - i didn't.
then why were you in stalker mode outside the agency last night?
we caught you on tape fleeing the scene.
that doesn't make me guilty.
innocent people don't usually run away.
I'm not playing this game. gloria was like a sister to me.
we need to move.
now!
all right, we got 'em! we got 'em.
who were those shooters?
in case you missed it, they tried to kill me, too.
look - easy, abbs.
let's do this back at the office.
no, she starts filling in the blanks right now.
I got a text from gloria.
she wanted me to meet her after work.
then why not come in instead of lurking around on the street?
I'm shy hey, did she say what she wanted?
personal case she was working on.
she wanted to show me something.
deal with them or come with us.
it's your call.
you girls decent?
Yeah, i just updated charlie.
I've got gloria's phone records. she texted eve at 12: 35 a. m.
Wow. she wasn't lying about your mad hacking skills.
okay, uh, i'm not a big fan of the "h" word.
it's like telling picasso he's good at throwing paint onto a canvas.
wait. gloria talked to you about us?
said you were the best crew she ever had.
she never mentioned you once.
that doesn't mean we weren't close.
I met gloria when i was 5.
St. theresa's orphanage in el salvador.
how did you end up in central america?
my parents were aid workers.
they were killed in the civil war down there.
when i got to st. t.'s, gloria took me under her wing and protected me.
Wow. from orphan to car thief to jailbird.
you should have your own reality show.
I'm not bitter about the cards i've been dealt.
if you wanna survive, you have to adapt.
is that what you're doing right now?
I know you're upset because gloria came to me instead of you.
but the fact that your feelings are hurt isn't my problem.
love a catfight, but, ladies, please, back to your corners.
Eve, according to her phone records, you two have been talking a lot recently.
Yeah. when i got paroled, gloria was helping me get back on my feet.
I swept her hard drive, if she was working a case on her downtime, she left no trace.
do you have any idea what she wanted to show you?
no, but i think we should go check out her apartment.
let's do it.
since when can the cops spare extra uniforms to babysit a victim's apartment?
let's find a way in. - yeah.
that's gloria's balcony, third floor.
ladies, i got this.
hand me the prada.
Abby put the "cat" in "cat burglar.
now the doughnut patrol makes sense.
somebody made it a crime scene.
but why trash her place?
they even gutted her gator.
I gave this to her last christmas.
this is pointless.
I wouldn't say that. you grow up in an orphanage, you learn how to hide things that are valuable.
Hey, guys.
since when did gloria have a cat?
she didn't.
Yeah, she's allergic.
then what's she doing with a kitty litter box?
that's my girl.
nuns force you to be crafty.
it's a class "a" floor safe.
blast-resistant, biometric lock.
last time i cracked one of these, it was under two minutes
but that was after two cosmos, and i was hanging upside-down.
I know this box. this was her mom's.
at st. t.'s orphanage, she never let it go.
it's a d. n.a. analysis report.
came back yesterday. - gloria had two samples tested.
a flake of blood from the box and...
saliva from this shot glass.
let's see.
club cypher.
that's on 10th and collins.
the two samples match. i wonder who the big winner is.
this is nestor rodrigo.
why would gloria be tracking him?
Oh, my god. she found him.
found who?
how do you know about him?
it's a long story. but i had no idea she tracked him down.
time-out. rodrigo's a multimillionaire.
he throws more white parties than diddy.
you sure he's pajaro?
I swear on my life.
we need to call bos.
Hey! come on! drop the gun!
give me your keys. - eve.
Eve, what are you doing?
keeping a promise i made to gloria a long time ago.
I'm serious.
what promise did you make?
to kill pajaro.
Eve, put the gun down. let's just talk this through.
there's nothing to talk about.
that's why gloria called me the other night.
so what's your big plan?
roll up to club cypher and blow rodrigo away?
he has to pay. - we loved gloria, too.
we wanna get justice, but this isn't the way to do it.
you have no idea what he's done.
how about trafficking underage girls?
he was behind a case we just broke.
16-year-old runaway.
we managed to help her, but there were others we couldn't save.
we can rescue them, then take down pajaro's entire operation, but not if you kill him.
he can't hurt another girl.
he won't. you have our word.
just so we're clear, eve, one of the biggest developers in south florida of trafficking kids.
you're sure this is the same guy?
before rodrigo was on magazine covers, he led a death squad in el salvador.
I know because i saw him with my own eyes.
Gloria dared me to sneak into the chapel at the orphanage.
there was a wooden angel on the altar, and we were gonna carve our initials in the back of it.
that's when the trucks came.
pajaro was there to steal the girls...
and he murdered the nuns and the boys.
they wore masks and attacked without warning.
wait.
if rodrigo wore a mask, how can you be sure it's him?
I have an angel to thank for that.
we hid under the altar.
Gloria was clutching her butterfly box so tight, i thought she'd break it.
pajaro came in to search the chapel, and that's when i saw his face, and so did gloria.
I knew what he was gonna do with us, so i hit him with the angel.
and then we ran for our lives.
the faces of the girls we left behind still haunt me.
is that why you and gloria made your pact to kill pajaro?
I get it. you wanted him to pay.
how are we gonna nail this guy?
we aren't.
Abby, bos, and i will take it from here.
what? - this isn't about revenge, eve.
if we're gonna shut down rodrigo's operation, we need him alive.
about tonight, i'm sorry.
too late. you're benched.
Rodrigo's been giving the cops the middle finger for years.
we don't exactly play by the rules either.
Yeah, we're angels, not saints.
I ran nestor rodrigo past my intelligence sources.
let me guess. he's squeaky-clean.
spotless.
Sarah daniels is the only one of pajaro's victims that has ever been saved.
Abby, was she able to give you any insight?
she said she was chained to some other girls.
most of them were speaking spanish.
here's an interesting fact.
his foundation builds orphanages in central america.
rodrigo must be using it to funnel girls into the country for trafficking.
the man runs a criminal enterprise in the 21st century.
the information has to be there somewhere.
actually, it's in someone.
her name is nadia kozlova. she has a photographic memory.
one of my buddies at m. i.t. told me about her.
thought she was an urban legend.
she absconded with $14 million from the russian mob.
Rodrigo's bodyguards aren't only for his protection.
they're for hers.
they go with her everywhere, except inside his star island compound.
did we say that you were benched or no?
actually, i thought miss french could assist you.
Gloria was the only family i had. i wanna help.
it's fortunate for you that i believe in second chances.
don't let me down. - i won't.
is this okay with you guys?
it's charlie's call.
according to his twitter feed, rodrigo is hosting a charity fund-raiser at his mansion tomorrow night.
theme is heaven and hell.
sounds like we'll blend right in.
big party, lots of security distractions.
we go undercover and grab nadia.
hate to buzzkill the plan, but don't you think police might consider that kidnapping?
the police need evidence. i only need certainty.
Nadia is the best way to link rodrigo to his crimes and take him down.
watch your backs, angels.
good-bye, charlie. - thanks, charlie.
good-bye, charlie.
Bye.
there's rodrigo.
bos, are you set?
truck's in position in the back by the bathrooms.
once the spray hits nadia's stomach, she'll start cramping within 30 seconds.
when she heads to the bathroom, that's when we'll grab her and get her to the catering truck.
Eve, stay on rodrigo. let us know if he moves.
got it.
you wanna take the first shot at nadia?
she's right by the ice sculpture.
can hardly tell the two apart.
looks just like her.
Bridget and priscella. - dalton prep?
uh, yeah. the wentworth sisters.
sure. hi.
it's been, uh, it's been forever.
Yeah, cute outfit.
uh... are you one of the servers?
Yeah. yeah. recession's a bitch, you know.
Oh. considering what your father did, i'd call it payback.
do you know how much money he screwed our uncle out of?
uh, no idea.
I, uh, i haven't spoken to my dad in...
Oh. that's for my facebook page.
Yeah.
blini?
Yeah. oh, sure. - thanks.
Bye. - you are so welcome.
nice friends. - yeah.
you all right?
I will be in about 30 seconds.
Oh, my god.
instant ex-lax.
well, at least we know the gut juice works.
no wonder gloria liked you.
you're up next, kate.
hors d'oeuvre? - no, thank you.
we missed our window.
time for plan "b.
as in, uh, plan bosley?
whoa. whoa, whoa, whoa. we never fully discussed plan bosley.
well, we know her deal with rodrigo is strictly business.
I'd say bosley trumps beluga any day of the week.
I'll meet you at the catering truck.
all right.
that's the total number of guests.
58 servers, 29 busboys, 16 valets, 2 ice sculptures, and one very beautiful woman.
what are you?
doctor, lawyer, internet billionaire?
starving grad student.
and to watch the rich and famous in their natural habitat.
and what do you think of the wildlife so far?
just got more exotic.
guys, rodrigo's on the move.
he could be looking for nadia.
bos, time to put the party on wheels.
get nadia to the catering truck.
why don't we find a place with a little more privacy?
Yeah. the guest house is on the other end of the compound.
my buddy's catering truck's right there.
down and dirty's not my style.
okay. okay. not down and dirty. we'll keep it nice and clean.
you have five seconds to tell me who you really are.
fine.
I'm a heartbreaker.
nice job, casanova.
took you long enough.
guys, i lost rodrigo.
never mind. we got nadia.
just get changed and get the hell out of there.
see?
I knew the devil would get me eventually.
Eve, where are you?
coming.
Eve, we have to move now.
I'm delayed. don't wait.
let's go.
I kept that as a reminder of when i let two little girls get away.
you killed my best friend.
it was her own fault.
she should've left the past alone.
Nadia's missing.
your past is about to catch up with you...
Eve, can you hear me?
what have we here?
you're full of surprises.
Eve, are you there?
once i bring the ice princess out of sleep mode, she's all yours, detective.
Hi. easy.
the captain hasn't turned off the "fasten seat belt" sign.
where are you taking me?
you're 25, 000 feet above the atlantic en route to st. petersburg.
ripping off a russian crime boss wasn't exactly the smartest idea.
petrovski sent you?
these days, he hires pretty girls to do a man's job.
you hear that, abbs?
she called us pretty.
such a sweetheart.
whatever he's paying you, i'll double it.
so turn the plane around.
rodrigo grabbed one of our team. where would he take her?
as soon as we land in miami, i'll tell you.
you're lying.
she'll be dead by then.
it's my best offer.
here's some in-flight entertainment.
it's a home movie of the last guy who crossed petrovski.
hope you're not squeamish.
now that guy is an artist with a nail gun.
you think that scares me?
well, you should hear what he has in store for you.
if it makes you feel any better, he's all bent up about having to kill his little babushka.
isn't that what he used to call you?
how did you know that?
boris and i are extremely close enjoy your flight.
Oh, wait.
flamingo boat yard.
he would have taken your friends there.
okay, bos, it's time to bail.
don't open that door! are you insane?
Hey, relax.
at least you're not in coach.
who took nadia?
tell me where they took nadia.
who took nadia?!
you had enough?
just... getting... warmed... up.
just getting warmed up.
Oh, my god. look.
this is where rodrigo must be storing the girls he traffics.
Eve's running out of time. we gotta move now.
new plan. you get the girls.
I'll get eve. go.
who took nadia?!
tell me who took nadia!
who took nadia?
Nadia's not as tough as this one.
she'll break.
time to slash and burn. and kill her.
bos!
you're safe now come on you'll spend the rest of your life in a cage.
that's what you deserve, pajaro.
thought i might find you here.
Gloria's uncle used to own this garage, right?
Yeah. i rebuilt my first engine here when i was 13.
but you're not here to talk about cars.
Charlie told me he called you.
came by to see if you've considered his offer.
Yeah. um...
I'm just not sure why he'd want me.
well, he keeps his criteria close to the vest.
my bet--he's impressed with your abilities to adapt to situations, your above average driving skills, and the fact that your employment options are extremely limited.
mm, yes, is that how he got you?
I was staring at a 20-year sentence for tax fraud.
planted a virus in the i. r.s. mainframe, skimmed a penny off everybody's tax return.
my own personal stimulus package.
I've already done my time, and working for a voice in a box isn't really my style.
first rule of the townsend agency
zero face time with the boss.
tell him i appreciate the offer, but it's not for me.
you know why charlie calls the women who work for him "angels"?
Why?
because they show up when you least expect it when you need them the most.
trust me. i'm no angel.
Why?
because you have a past you're not proud of?
look at this as your second chance, like the one you gave gloria.
she was with you the night you were arrested, but you let her walk away from the accident before the cops showed up.
she had always protected me. i wanted to protect her.
besides, she's the only family i had.
we're a family, too.
I think you could use one of those right now.
it's charlie.
take my advice.
answer the call.
the hours can be long.
and kate can be really bossy.
Oh! and abby will overshare and want to borrow all your clothes.
she's right, and i totally have dibs on those shoes.
just remember. we earn our wings together.
I'm ready.
welcome to the angels.
somebody would like to say hello.
I trust you're all enjoying my yacht.
it's amazing.
help! Help!
we need help.
thank goodness you stopped!
what happened? - Don't know.
come on, breathe, please.
I'm calling 911. - You guys see anything?
I don't know. - No.
we have an unconscious man at the beach.
breathe for me!
quantum Sands. Hurry.
you're OK, you're OK. What's your name?
where am I? - Miami Beach.
what's going on?
just tell us your name.
my name is...
I don't know my name.
I don't know.
once upon a time, there were three young women 'who got into very big trouble.
now they work for me.
my name is Charlie.'
Hey, I brought some clothes. I hope they fit.
Thanks, Bos.
how do you guys think he ended up on that beach?
looks like he's taken a like to you.
well, she did give himmouth to mouth.
come on! - Is that what we're calling it?
excuse me. Your John Doe's had major trauma.
that could account for his memory loss.
wait, are we talking about amnesia?
the diagnostic term is dissociatave amnesia.
well, is he OK?
no sign of head or internal injuries, so whatever's caused his memory loss is just all up here.
is it permanent?
his memory could come back with therapy, medication and the support mechanism at home.
we don't even know if he has a home.
so what happens now? - He'll be released.
to who? He doesn't remember a thing.
well, we'll call social services in Miami PD, but we just don't have the bed space to keep him here.
you don't have to call social services.
he can come with us.
I guess it's settled. - OK.
can I see him? - Sure.
forgive me, but I thoughtthis was your day off?'
I thought it was, but your angels seem to attract trouble wherever they go.
it is not our fault that Eve has a soft spot for strays.
er, excuse me, I heard that.
hugo is upstairs taking a shower.
you said he had no name.'
he had a suit, like Hugo Boss.
an amnesiac with good taste.
did he have anything on him thatmight help discover his identity?'
a key with 815 on it.
Abby, sounds like your department.'
I've already sent a digitalimprint over to Romana.
who's Romana?- My key-maker.
but I thought you were the master lock-picker?
who do you think taught me? Ramona is the Wikipedia of keys.
if this thing opens anything in theWestern Hemisphere, she'll find it.
in the meantime, I'll run his prints through the databases.
I have friends in missing persons checking for open case files that fit Hugo's description.
sounds like you've gotyour marching orders without me.'
we'll keep you posted, Charlie.
just remember, sometimes, strays bite. Be careful, Angels.'
you're good at this. Ex-cop?
Ex-thief.
but now you're a private detective?
Yeah, with three other ex-criminals for a man we've never met.
Thanks. - Thanks for what?
for making my amnesiathe normal part of this conversation.
I don't need to meet my boss.
Charlie gave me a second chance when the rest of the world had written me off.
that's why you didn't leave meon the beach?
Thanks...for saving my life.
you're welcome.
how are those prints coming along?
good. We're done.
you must be exhausted?
why don't you go upstairs, rest up for a bit?
OK. I think I will.
Hey, Bos. - Hey. Prints?
Yes.
no matches.
good, proves he's not a bad guy.
or that he hasn't been caught and fingerprinted.
does he really look like a criminal mastermind to you?
and what does a criminal mastermind look like?
that's a good question.
OK, thanks.
that was missing persons.
no-one's looking for Hugo, but I went through his police reports.
apparently, a Cadillac CTS went off the MacArthur Causeway early this morning.
airbags were deployed, but no bodies were found.
maybes Hugo's our Cadillac guy. Any plates?
the police report doesn't say. The car was brand-new.
depending on the currents,
hugo could've drifted from the causeway to the beach he washed up on.
well, the timeframe makes sense.
anyone fish out the Caddie?
it was towed to the impound lot in the marina.
why don't I take Hugo there? Maybe seeing the car will jog his memory.
good idea. I'll go with you.
it's OK, I've got it.
this is a safe key, one of 1, 600 ordered to the exact specs of theSunshine State Bank And Trust.
so is it a safe bet that this opens safety deposit box 815?
let's go find out.
follow my lead.
excuse me? This area's restricted.
Hi, how are you? I'm with Amalgamated Insurance Company.
we have a claim with the Caddie recovered from the bay last night.
OK, and you are?
I'm, er, her supervisor.
it's my first week as an insurance adjuster.
OK. It's at the end of aisle five. It's the one leaking the seawater.
thank you.
call me...if you need anything.
you see how easy that was?
Yeah, I'm a natural.
you OK?
I'm just wondering how I managedto drive my car off a bridge.
you're probably just a really crappy car driver.
with no ID or fingerprints.
you're are a man of mystery.
I just hope I like the person I find.
how do you feel about him so far?
well, pretty good, but I guess having no regrets'll do that.
no regrets - I like that philosophy.
you mean my condition?
Yes, your condition.
can I help you?
good God, that's my car?!
unless someone else drove it off the Causeway last night.
well, I don't think it was me.
whoever it was was shot at with an assault rifle by the looks of these.
why would anybody wantto do that to me?
I don't know. Let's make sure this is your car.
no insurance, no registration, no rental agreement.
I've got somethinglike postcard or a flyer.
does it bring back anything?
no, nothing.
you know it's going to be OK, right?
well, it looks pretty far from OKright now. Somebody wants me dead.
we're going to find out who.
No!
give me the gun! Give me the gun.
give me the gun.
I almost shot that guy! - But you didn't!
only cos you stopped me.
who am I?
I don't know.
bos and Hugo are checking photos to try and ID the guy who attacked him.
I just wish you could've seen how quickly he disarmed that guy.
sounds like he went fromHugo Boss to Jason Bourne.
like someone flipped a switch.
what do you think? Military, Blackwater?
that's the happy version.
the scary one is he could be a professional hitman or even a mercenary.
let's not go there.
OK, what about the guywho attacked you?
he was Asian, average height, no distinguishing marks other than the gun.
but did he say anything?
may he was a disgruntled former colleague or even partner in crime?
why do we always have to assume the worst?
you need to check this out...OK.
we got this from safe 815 from the Sunshine State Bank And Trust.
exhibit A. - It's adorable.
Yeah, it gets dark. - Look at this.
I'm guessing the money's untraceable? - Yeah.
he used it along with a false name to pay for his safety deposit box.
what name? - Francis Fratelli.
from The Goonies?
the gun's serial numbers have been filed off.
don't ask about the dolphin.
I'm dying to know about the dolphin. - Us too.
we want to run the gun against the Miami PD ballistics database, see if I can get a match.
I'll see you girls in a bit. - Ciao, bella.
there's gotta be an explanation.
are you OK if it's an ugly one?
I... I just think that...
I know what it's like to be alone in the world and I think that's what he is right now.
I know. Well, sooner or later, he'll have his memories backand we'll have a full picture.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
so, you have no idea of how you were able to defend yourself?
well, I do have an excuse.
it doesn't mean I can't ask the question.
I doubt I could do it again.
not bad. I'm guessing you were, er, marines, special forces?
you can let go now. - Let me ask you a question.
Eve, is she single?
why don't you figure out which side of the law you're on than worry about dating?
if I stepped on your toes asking...
guys?
hope you two are playing nice.
just getting to know each other.
is everything OK?
Yeah, there's something I need to show you.
where did I get all this money?
well, that was at your safety deposit box at the Sunshine State Bank And Trust.
I'm guessing whoever I was didn'tleave some photo ID or something?
no, it was paid for with a fake name.
OK, um, what about this dolphin?
maybe you're a stuffed-toy aficionado.
or not. It's an idea.
what about the postcard?
the one I found in the car?
Yeah, it's a commercially available stock photo of South Beach.
it's been used for book covers, a postcard, a flyer for Nikki Beach.
Nikki Beach? - You remember it?
Yeah! - It's a beach club, dancing, DJs, tepees?
do you think you've been there?
I think I was there.
for a man with no memory, you have good taste in clothes and parties.
I was following a guy.
he was a regular at the bar.
I don't suppose you know that guy's name?
no, no, but...
he had dark hair, brown, not much of it.
he had a goatee.
two more.
here's those drinks!
Oh, look, it's like a little traffic light! - Yeah!
Yeah! Well, to life at the beach.
that's cool, yeah!
that's like not the guy remembered.
you hear that guys? - ' Got it.'
Abby, we just rolled snake eyes. Ditch the goatee and find another.
I'm waiting for facial recognition in case anyone rings a bell.
so I got a placenear the fountain blue, a beautiful view of the ocean, we could watch the sunrise together.
Yeah, I am so sorry, you're going to be rising and shining alone, but you did a really good job today and I don't want you to feel bad about it and this is very...contemporary.
Cheers.
that's perfect.
any more goatees in your sights?
Mmm, this whole place is goatees. - Totally.
would you think less of me if I told you I liked this drink?
Yes!
Oh, wait a minute.
what's happening?! - Hi!
my mum's out of town!
I've got the whole place to myself. We can use the big room!
that's not him.
give him the hand, Kate. - I'm Rick. You're gorgeous.
you're not, sorry. You've gotta go.
I can't... I am speechless.
I can't imagine myself hanging out at a place like this.
it could be worse. You could have a goatee.
you know, part of me hopesmy memory never comes back.
clean slate? - Yeah, it's like a second chance.
that's actually the name of my boat.
Really? - Yeah, it's docked at the quays.
I thought you were a car girl?
Oh, I am, I used to live on a boat before it got sprayed up by bullets.
past life. - That's why you call itSecond Chance?
er, yeah, that and it is my second boat.
I don't know what kind of guy you used to be, Hugo, but...
you don't seem like a bad one.
well... I'll try andstay in your good graces.
and I don't know what my lifewas about before, but...
right now, it seems like it'sprobably better with you around.
Hey, sorry to interrupt your moment, but Abby's got another candidate in her sights.
can I buy you a shot?
you know, I am, I'm just not a shot kind of person.
I have bottle service at my cabana. - That's him.
of course you do, everybody does.
Abby, get his glass, I'll run his prints and get an ID.
God, you know, I'm just in a really bad mood, with this heat, and your cabana just sounds so great.
um, so why don't you give me a second to go freshen up and change my attitude and I will see you there in a second, OK?
I'm so happy we met, so, so happy.
that was easy. - Nice job.
get Hugo away in case goatee guy wants him dead. I'll meet you there.
sounds good. Hugo, let's get you out of here.
I need answers.
shots fired!
we need to talk. - Who are you?
detective Bradley Dumont, LAPD.
the man you know as Hugo Boss is actually named Josh Taylor.
he joined the LAPD out of the Marine corps.
he was working undercoverwith the DEA joint task force.
well, this explains why we couldn't find anything on him.
these files were taken offline and sealed to protect his cover.
now, unfortunately, he crossed the line.
Taylor put a bullet in his partnertwo months ago and ran off with LAPD buy money .
I've been tracking him ever since. - I just don't believe it.
look, I hate to be the bearer. Josh Taylor is as dirty as they come.
I'm just glad your associationwith him endedbefore he led you somewhere ugly.
I wasn't aware it was over.
we're PIs. He's our client.
how does our dead guy, Lapointe, fit in?
Yeah, why would Hugo or Josh want to kill him in cold blood?
look, you can investigateall you want but the operational detailsof my case are extremely sensitive.
the way I see it, you're working with a wanted man.
a wanted man with amnesia. Why not check that?
I'm just not buying that storyand you might not want to believe it but Josh Taylor is a dangerousand violent sociopath.
do yourselves a favourand stay out of this case.
there's no happy ending here for him.
I made some calls.
Josh Taylor's partner was shot andkilled in Los Angeles two months ago, 'just like Dumont told us.
the police haven't releasedthe names of suspects.'
but they do have one? - 'Yes, it's Josh.'
it just doesn't sound right.
I'm sorry, Eve, this is confirmed.'
what about Brad Dumont?
a spotless record and consideredone of LAPD's best detectives.'
I was considered one of Miami PD's best and brightest.
what's your point, Kate?'
I'm just not convinced Brad Dumont's intentions are all so noble.
what makes you say that? - Gut feeling.
look, cop killers are big game.
Dumont knows no-one's going to blame a detective that shoots first and asks questions later.
you think Dumont's planning on killing Josh?
I've a low tolerance for vendettas.
you need to find Joshbefore Dumont does.'
Eve and I are on it.
Abby and I will look into Lapointe.
go to it, Angels, but tread lightly.'
Thanks, Doyle, I owe you one.
that was a buddy of mine in Traffic.
the cops talked to all the cab companies.
the doorman at Nicky Beach put Hugo in a taxi. The driver dropped him off on J Street.
sure? That's five blocks from Manatee Quays.
isn't that where you keep your boat?
he just wants a second chance.
let's go.
lapointe owned a bunch of souvenir shops along Miami Beach.
I, of course, hacked into his company's database.
So...can you make anything of these?
these are import-export contracts, primarily with Chinese suppliers.
import-export is a good business if you're thinking of smuggling.
13 pallets of snow globes to betransported to the port of Miami.
it freaks me out when you do that.
who knew all those hours my fatherforced me to learn Mandarin paid off.
is our blue dolphin in a contract?
only one way of finding out.
print out the contractsand I'll translate over lunch.
should I order Chinese?
Hey, stop! - All right!
I see you found my gun. - I didn't shoot that guy.
then put the gun down and talk to us.
his name was Greg Lapointe. Why did you run?
because I saw who did and I knewhe was going to kill me next.
we believe you, Josh. Now put down the gun.
wait, my name is Josh?
detective Josh Taylor. You're with LAPD.
I'm a cop?! How did I end up in Miami?
we're not sure but there's another detective looking for you.
Brad Dumont. Does that name ring a bell to you?
no. Is he my partner?
not exactly.
wait, that's the guy from the club. That's the guy who killed Lapointe.
so I'm a dirty copwho killed his partner?
his name's John Corry.
I shot him. This just doesn't seem real.
we don't want to believe it either.
Yes, but it's hardto fight this evidence.
do you remember anything about Lapointe?
what kind of business you guys had?
no, it's a mess. It's like puzzlepieces that don't fit together.
but without your memory, all we have is Dumont's word.
OK. So, I'm a cop.
maybe I was investigating Lapointe?
or maybe this Brad Dumont guyand I were working together and he killed Lapointe to...
I don't know. I'm sorry. I just...
maybe... I wouldn't blameyou if you turned me in right now.
with dirty cops, the story is never black-and-white.
I know it looks bad but you can't lose faith.
we're all about second chances here.
Lapointe's Chinese contactinside the united States is this man.
Frankie Han. Sound familiar?
no. But those Chinese characters...I recognise them.
I don't know what they arebut I've seen them.
they're Triad markings. The Chinese Mafia.
Frankie Han runs the South Florida branch.
we need to have a conversation with Frankie.
getting close won't be easy.
maybe we just call Dumont and share this with him.
it's not my first choice.
Frankie Han does own a ridiculously over-priced Asian fusion restaurant.
you know, I always thoughtthe prices were criminal.
now I know why.
check out the swag. - The Ming Dynasty called. They want their vases back.
ha! Time to find Frankie Han and get him bugged.
you must be the replacements? - We are.
so I heardthe waitresses were arrested?
by immigration. Tell me your papers are in order.
Oh, yeah, we are not going to cause a problem.
you'd better not. Pick up a tray at the bar and work the lounge area.
you -main dining room. They need back up on tables five to eleven.
so how do you pick who getsto dress up for these missions?
depends on the outfit. - All right, people. Let's focus.
OK. I've got Abby. Go ahead, Abby.
I think I have something. Check it out.
that room looks restricted.
wait a minute. I recognise him. Isn't that the guy at the impound?
I think I could get past him, if only I had a distraction. Kate?
I'm on it.
I am so sorry.
let me help. Let me help you with that. Oh, let me help. Sorry! Sorry.
it's OK. - Heading into the back room now.
it's OK.
blow on them.
I found Frankie Han.
can you get close enough to bug him?
well, he likes girls, he likes booze . I think I can figure something out.
what are you doing here?'
well, I was just bringing Mr Hanhis drink.
I already have a drink.
I'm sorry, sir, I...
come on, let's go.
ladies, we got a problem. Brad Dumont just showed up.
I'll slow him down.
Hey, you're not going anywhere. Last time, someone wound up dead.
so, guys, want me to roll down a window - let out some testosterone?
they're private detectives, working with Taylor.
why don't you ladies come to the back room?
all right. Buy me time, I'm getting you out of there.'
how? - Watch and learn.
almost there, Abby. Pulling the trigger in five.'
you're going to pull the fire alarm?
it's a fire-suppression system.
it uses a non-toxic gas so Frankie's priceless antiquities don't sustain fire or water damage.
four. - We don't need weaponsto blow this place apart.
this is your final warning.
all right, let's go!
nice one, Bosley. - I have my moments.
let's see what's on the bug.
I thought you didn't get close enough to Han.
no, but I got close enoughto his bodyguard.
I think you guys might want to listen to this.
calm down, Frankie.' - 'Don't tell me to calm down!
Taylor was your responsibility. Now he has private detectives on me?'
look, they came on a fishing tripand left empty-handed.
they found my involvement in this, didn't they?
Josh Taylor has amnesia. He won't get in the way.'
you're damn right. You're going to take care of him and his associates.
I dealt with his partner and I'll deal with this...
after I get my pieceof the Coral Dragon shipment.
coral Dragon?
Dumont killed my partner.
and he's framing you to take the fall.
I am not a killer. - I know you're not.
coral Dragon is a cargo ship containing ten of Frankie Han's containers.
it came in this morning. Port of Miami.
they were offloaded into a warehouse by the docks.
but what's in those containers?
crates and crates full of these.
Hey, hands up!
well, anybody want a souvenir?
what is it? - There is nothing in these. They are just toys.
makes no sense. They wouldn't go through this for stuffed animals.
maybe they are using the dolphins as a distraction.
a silica gel. It's supposed to keep the toys dry.
that look like silica gel to you?
no, what is that? - Illegal drugs?
wait a minute, I remember something . I have seen this before.
it's a synthetic painkiller.
hit the streets of LA aboutsix months ago.
there was a bad batch. A lot of people died.
and you are all going to die for seeing it.
drop the guns. We've got you surrounded.
keep your hands where I can see 'em.
well, well, well. I can't say it surprises me.
it is one hell of a wayto end a partnership, Brad.
you and I were never partners.
not as cops, maybe, but as criminals.
you didn't tell Mr Han aboutour deal?
hugo? What are you doing?
I'm not letting this guy put a bulletin me without Mr Han knowing why.
what is this? - Brad sent me to Miamito follow Lapointe.
we were going to sellthe drugs ourselves.
nice story. This man has amnesia. He doesn't even know who I am.
right, the amnesia. Thanks for that idea, Brad. It worked well.
it was almost as goodas taking the drugs to LA and selling out the Triadsto the DEA.
he's lying!
put your gun down.
are you OK?
Oh! No, no, no.
Night-night, partner.- No!
Hugo. Look at me.
I'm calling 911.
you're OK.
how are you feeling?
you tell me.
the doctor said you're going to make a full recovery.
what about Dumont and Frankie Han?
DEA custody.
turns out you were right. I'm one of the good guys.
Yeah, you are.
thanks for believing in me.
maybe when you get out of here we can make some new memories.
look, Eve, there is somethingl have to tell you.
when I took that bullet...something happened.
I remembered.
what did you remember?
daddy!
Josh! Thank God! - Hi.
I'm so glad we found you. We were so afraid.
this is Eve.
Hi. - She's a private detective.
the Townsend Agency? The police told me everything you did my husband.
thank you so much. - You're welcome.
Bye, Josh.
he just found out.
I'm sorry. - It's OK.
told you he was a good guy.
I know that.
you still have Abby and Kate.
and me, of course.
us Marshal, stop!
what is this guy on?
us Marshals, everyone just stay where they are!
put your hands up, and slowly turn around.
turn around. I said turn around.
this is a dream.
you at the altar, I'm gonna say it again, turn around.
you ok?
Yeah, how long was I out?
about 15 minutes.
been sleeping like crap.
I got an hour last night. - You were talking to yourself.
was I? - Yeah.
you said Jimmy and Ben.
no I did not... - Yeah, you did.
any sign of Harcourt? - No.
the guy is wanted for assault charges. - Not really known for the punctuality.
I mean, are we sure about this tip? - My DEA buddy said that Harcourt's been running pot out of this place, he's been here the last three Saturdays.
we got a car coming up the alley.
it's a silver Saturn Texas plates.
it's X-4-S T-T-3.
it's registered to Harcourt's father.
it's Harcourt behind the wheel. - Yup.
looks like he's got a friend with him.
we go in? Subdue the front take Harcourt down.
us Marshals US Marshals, down on the ground!
we got a runner out the back! - I got him!
- Backyard!
what are you running for?
you really don't want to do that Harcourt.
now doesn't that hurt?
should we get him down? - Yeah, at some point.
get in the car Harcourt watch your head.
Marco what you got?
name is Jackie Walsh, favourite color is blue, likes pizza, dancing, and long walks on the beach, ain't that right Jack?
any idea why he ran?
Luke is running his ID. We're just sitting tight.
hey man you gotta believe me man, I wasn't the shooter.
what did you say Jackie? - I wasn't the shooter.
come here. - You ready for this?
Jackie Walsh, we got an open warrant for him as well.
he's on of the four guys wanted for killing that cop a month ago.
the Ellen Lacey murder? - Yeah.
so not only do we clear our assault and battery we get a good lead on four copkillers.
it's not even lunch.
look man, I didn't kill that cop. John Makin.
steven "Little Boy" Washington, and Francis Washington.
where are they?
you know what, it's not that cop. Her name is Ellen Lacey.
she's 32 years old.
she's a wife... mother.
nothin' bad was supposed to happen.
we was just headin' out to collect for some idiot crackhead.
and after we you know we goin' out right?
just like we used to do back in the old days.
show some Houston ladies how the New Orleans boys play.
why so quiet little boy? You miss your prison boyfriends?
what the hell did you do Francis?
nothing. - I can't be here man, I jumped bail.
calm down Makin. Don't tell me to calm down, I'm facing 6 months.
you don't got no weapons on you right?
it's cool, everything's gonna be good.
license and proof of insurance please.
was I speeding officer? You tell me, were you?
I don't think so.
it's cause you weren't, but your tail lights are both out.
can I get an ID on everyone please?
Makin! - Stop! Get down on the ground!
stop!
what the hell you doing there boy? - One of us runs, we all get hauled in.
he faces 6 months, I'm facing life for being here with you.
now get in the car. - Everybody get in the damned car.
makin, get back here.
you you gotta believe me man, I ain't never done nothin' worse than petty theft
I'll tell y'all what ever y'all wanna know.
alright.
after the shooting... I got dropped off at my sister's house.
makin went to the hotel to lay low, and
Francis and "Little Boy" I ain't seen them since.
do you have any communication with them?
Yeah, I mean we got cells, but we only turn them on everyday at like two o'clock.
you know, just for emergencies only. It's "Little Boy's" idea.
he said we could talk, but we can't be traced.
y'all gonna tell the Judge how I helped out though yeah?
Oh, yeah.
but you're not done helping us yet.
gonna need their trigger van.
two minutes to the call. Two minutes!
eye on the prize, every 10 seconds gets us a quarter mile closer to ID their location.
just so you know I'm pretty good at dream analysis.
I'm just saying you know Daisy going to jail, Jimmy getting engaged, - a lot of changes... - Mhmm.
all I'm saying is, if you need someone to give you an opinion about what's eating you...
you're my guy? Ok. - I'm your guy.
you know, actually there is a dream you can help me with.
so I'm sitting in this van right, in this dream
van...
you're there.
I'm there?
and you finally stop bugging me long enough so that we can run down four copkillers.
OK? Yeah.
it's time.
alright Jimmy let's go ahead and make the call
keep it general. I don't want them getting suspicious do you understand me?
Mhmm. - They'll take your call right?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, man, these guys are like brothers to me we grew up together in New Orleans.
longer you keep them on, the easier the Judge goes on you.
hey Jackie.
hey what's up Francis, what you doin' man?
what you need man?
hey are you still with "Little Boy?"
they're still in Houston. - Alright keep him talking Jimmy.
what about John?
they're somewhere north of the city, close to Coverdale and West Branch.
alright get on the 610 loop to the I45 north
I was just thinking that we should all like meet up.
you know, like face to face.
give me that. What you calling here for Jackie?
little Boy?
look like Acres Homes. - Who are you with? Where were are you at?
who are you with Jackie?
what happened? Did he hang up? - By the sound of it, I think he shot it.
woah, woah man, calm down.
I go out here to sell a little smack, and you here didn't check it up?
how long where you on the phone for man?
I don't know, a few minutes? - Come on France.
man that's long enough for them to trace us.
you think Jackie flipped? Yeah man...
he's a weak son of a bitch.
what should we do man? Pack up, go get Makin?
get the hell out of Houston.
I still get credit for helping right?
get him out of here. - My pleasure.
uh, Natalie. Hey! Hey. Hi.
you looking for Jimmy?
Jimmy. Yeah. Wedding planning.
hmm? Oh, right.
uh, chocolate or French Silk?
string quartet or jazz?
you know how it is. It's...
yeah...
well, I... yeah. Guess you can't ever go wrong with plain old chocolate.
that's always good, right? - Jackie Walsh!
you son of a...!
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Sit down.
calm down. Sit. Sit!
relax.
what's going on? Who is this?
he... he killed my wife.
they left Ellen in the road to die.
at least I didn't shoot him, right?
you work HPD, like Ellen did, right?
when it first happened...
the entire force is looking for these guys.
but the department's only got so many resources.
you know how it goes.
now we're on it, too.
I've been keeping track of the search.
don't know if there's anything there that might help you.
no, we've...
we've got most of this.
so what... what is that number? Guy I hired to help me.
I'm going to add this.
this I'll have to... follow up on.
I was wondering when you'd show.
Mm. I've been busy.
been meaning to call you. Can I come in?
not without a warrant.
so...
you've been working the Ellen Lacy killing.
always business with you. Come on, Ben.
the husband hired me on a private contract.
so tell me what I don't know.
anything not in that file.
look, Annie. You know I like you and everything, but that's money out of my pocket. Ben, they killed a cop.
I want these guys bad, especially the shooter.
Ah, the shooter, Little Boy.
Mm-hmm? He's a nasty piece of work.
talked to a couple of guys that knew him at the Darrington Correctional Facility.
Yeah, he had a rough time? One way to put it. His cellmate hung himself, but, word was, Little Boy strung him up.
you know why?
I'm not in the "why" business. I'm in the "where" business.
and Little Boy's gone like Christmas.
Yeah, he is.
I mean, do you know anything about Little Boy's brother Francis?
John Macon? No. I had one lead.
Macon's sister worked at a rug factory down in North Houston.
you think he was staying there? He was, up until two weeks ago.
I almost had him there.
thanks for the tip.
no, hey. I mean, really...
you're telling me that that is the only reason that you came here?
I think you should take off your badge.
stay awhile.
don Macon's sister-- This is her workplace.
houston PD tracked a LoJack. This blue Honda...stolen by a man fitting Macon's description.
we got a security guard who says he's in there alone.
let's do this.
Oh! Oh, hell.
turn around so I can see your face.
I'm right here.
Hey.
good dream?
Yeah.
someone's in a hurry.
this thing between you and I... Oh...
this doesn't sound good.
I shouldn't have stayed last night.
okay. What is it?
is it another guy?
that why?
thought you weren't in the "why" business.
coffee?
work.
Hey, Annie. John Macon's sister here.
she admitted that she let him hide at her work, two days last week.
she says he left and hasn't contacted her since.
so how'd you get the tip? Uh, Ben Crowley.
Oh, yeah? When was the last time you saw him?
weren't you wearing those clothes yesterday?
call Darrington, and have him send me Little Boy's files, and his cellmates'.
right.
Where's the sister?
I'll warn you, she's, uh, colorful.
I already talked to Eyelashes out there, I talked to Stretch.
now I got to talk to Bitcherella.
no, you don't have to talk to us.
did you put your house up, as collateral on your brother's bond?
you see, Johnny jumped bail so we can actually seize your house, now, you understand?
my house?! Because of what my brother did?
Yeah. You need the name of a good moving company, I'm sure we can get you one.
do I got to stay here?
no. You're free to go. Come on.
I'm going to tell you something, as soon as I file those papers, you'd better be ready to pack. You understand that?
she'll be calling her brother any minute now.
she's already been on her cell for close to a minute.
John! This is really screwing me over, With Little Boy, Look, if you want to go down - fine! But don't take my house. - Okay. Okay, listen.
I am handling this, Linda. - Clearly...
the cell signal's coming from near Baton Rouge, headed east.
can we play back the tape? Yeah.
do you hear that? - Okay, okay...
there's a whistle in the background.
Yeah, sounds like a train. Yeah, but a train with the doors open. No sound dampening.
freight train.
you never hopped a rail before?
you have to tell me that story sometime.
stories. Baton Rouge has a train yard. It's one mile north of the city.
let's call them. Search every freight train coming in.
you got it.
yo! Where you been Macon?
what's the plan, Little Boy?
where are we headed?
I got a stash. Get us out of the country.
stash, man. What's the stash?
I'm tired of all this...this hush-hush. I'm tired of this train... ! cool out, John.
I told you. The cops are watching the roads out of Houston.
Why's it always "Cool out, John"? Huh?
little Boy's the one what shot the cop. Not me! Not you!
why all of us got to suffer, including my sister, for what he had done?
"your sister"? When did you talk to your sister?
is that what you were just doing?
she's just family, man, like-like Francis and you.
I got to look out for her.
how many times I got to tell you, man?!
no cell phones!
I should throw you off next.
little Boy!
little boy!
Hey, get off him, Macon!
grab him, Francis!
what are you looking at me like that?
he attacked me! You saw him. You're bleeding.
you need to get off, then get you to a hospital.
no. No hospitals! Too easy to get caught, man.
think about it! You know anyone who could take us in?
Baton Rouge, Louisiana Engineer saw one of the guys jump off.
by the time he got the train stopped, they were long gone.
we heard there's a car stolen, from the neighborhood where they jumped. Is that right?
brown '99 Grand Am.
taken from a supermarket parking lot.
there's blood in the boxcar?
see for yourself.
whoever lost that much blood isn't getting very far without medical help.
contact nearby hospitals. Send photos of all three of them.
anybody who comes in with a major wound, we need to know about it.
Yeah. I got mugged.
they took my wallet and my phone. Okay, Let me get some more gauze.
I heard you haven't been sleeping much.
Marco. Come on, there's nothing wrong with a good old sex dream from time to...
first of all, it is none of your business.
Oh, yeah? Second of all, they're...
they're not sex dreams. No?
third, you... you kissed me, so...
Oh, yeah? How was I?
good?
it's time to go.
let's go.
thought you said a doctor was coming to sew this up.
I'll call again.
I'm losing a lot of bl...
drop the gun! Drop the gun!
slide it across the floor! Go on!
I'm gonna let this lady go when I get outside. You could let her go now.
are you okay? - Yeah.
two down, two to go.
Hey, Macon. Hey.
y-you broke my nose.
more like a hairline fracture.
where are your friends going?
one of them stabbed you, right? Here's your chance to get even.
little Boy stabbed me. And he wasn't always like that.
he got out of prison all crazy.
two years in maximum security. It was rough.
his cellmate hung himself to get out.
I asked you a question. Where are they going?
little Boy kept talking about some sort of stash he wanted to pick up.
where is this stash? I don't know.
honest, I don't know.
maybe back in New Orleans.
we were headed in that direction.
everything we had, we just left there.
little Boy was always talking about going back.
I'll have Marco and Luke check it out.
lower Ninth Ward New Orleans, Louisiana
clear!
place is empty.
Yep.
it's been five years since the flood.
thought they would have cleaned this by now.
this place looks like my first apartment.
smells like it, too.
find the stash? Not exactly.
Hey, Francis Washington's Link Chart, there anything about a kid?
a kid? No. Why?
I think he's got a son.
kid's name's "Kevin."
how do you know? Of the photo. It's written on the back "Kevin Price, born 2: 12 a. m. August 11, 2004."
different last name. Yeah.
sounds like a baby mama situation.
that would explain why the Bureau of Vital Statistics wouldn't have it.
Jackson, Mississippi
Hey, Kevin, it's me, your father.
daddy!
daddy! Daddy! Hey, there, Kevin.
this is your uncle.
Hi, uncle. Hey, kid.
get out of my yard.
Hey, just give us a minute to explain. Kevin? Kevin, baby, go play.
I'll call the cops.
come on. Ease up. It's me.
what are you doing here, Francis?
it'd be a big help if you'd let us crash a few nights, and I also want to see Kevin.
he's getting big, huh?
looks like me. Kids grow a lot in two years.
you can stay for a few hours.
no more. A few hours ain't gonna cut it.
we need food, we need beds.
little Boy, if she say we can't stay...
we gonna respect that.
you at least got a first-aid kit?
I'll show you.
why don't you spend a few minutes with your son?
he's good with that kid, huh?
you know, Allison...
we're gonna leave 'cause that's what Francis wants.
but if you're thinking about calling the cops, if you're thinking about telling them anything,
I'll come back here...
and I'll kill that kid.
you know, you should try to get some sleep.
we still got an got hour before we get to Jackson. Fat chance.
Yeah, me, too.
all this wedding planning stuff? It's, it's...
I saw Natalie; She came in with that wedding binder thing.
Yeah.
you know, she started fighting with me, and then she started talking about the wedding and...
how I'd sort of, kind of been distant.
then she asked me, she said, "You know, if I hadn't proposed to you, you know, would you have proposed to me?
and I...
that's what you were talking about the other day in the office?
I didn't have the answer.
I don't know that's what she was hoping for.
I think the wedding's off.
Jimmy, I'm...
you know what? We should try to get some shut-eye.
there you go.
Allison's house is a few blocks up. Jackson PD's gonna meet us there.
wait a minute. Those our guys right there?
Oh, yeah! That's them! Go, go, go!
u. S. Marshals!
Oh, come on. Not again.
you didn't have to kill Ben.
you could just marry me.
Jimmy's a free man, huh?
so what are you gonna do now?
you see the brown van there?
it's the car they stole after they jumped off the train.
they're here. You ready to do this?
Yeah, let's hit it.
u. S. Marshals!
are you the policemen?
or are you robber men? Where's your dad?
wh-what are you doing in my house?!
we're looking for Little Boy and Francis.
where is he? He left two hours ago.
took my car.
please, not in front of Kevin.
low crawl this guy so he can crawl in behind enemy lines.
I need you to tell me where he went. I can't say anything.
Why?
that guy? That guy?
now, what about these guys? Hey, we can protect you, Allison.
but can you protect my son?
his own nephew?
little Boy was always jealous.
thought it was him or us.
made Francis choose.
the only way I can help Francis is if he turns himself in.
Francis said he'd call.
promised to say good night to Kevin. And you believe that?
he said he wanted to start being a father.
and I told him, "You gotta prove it."
he's gonna call.
all right, you gotta make sure Little Boy isn't listening.
Hello?
Hey, it's me. Sorry I'm late.
is Kevin still up?
no, passed out.
is Little Boy with you?
he's getting some grub. Why?
Francis, this is Annie Frost
don't hang up. I'm with the U. S. Marshals.
I want to help you.
how you gonna do that?
little Boy is gonna go away for a long time, but you don't have to.
you want me to turn on my own brother?
you should, considering he threatened to kill your son.
you're lying.
Allison would talk. He was afraid
look, I raised Little Boy since he was four.
I know him. He wouldn't do that.
but he's gonna do everything I know you love him, he can to stay out of prison.
he's gonna tell you that he's the only person you can trust, that you need him to stay free...
your son. That he didn't threaten
I'm hanging up.
damn it. TOG just got a trace to a phone booth in Tallahassee.
I sent the local Marshals over there to check it out.
Tallahassee, Floride
where you been, man? Said you'd be gone five minutes.
this is survival, man.
all right?
we need each other. I know
I also need to see Kevin. You know.
trying to be a real dad, so he don't turn out...
what?
like me?
I did the best I could with you.
I was nine when I started looking after you.
you did good.
but you got to be smart about Kevin.
all right, you go back to Jackson, they gonna put you in jail, man.
Yeah, well, then, he'll come visit me in prison. No.
no, he won't.
they say they will, but they never do.
all right?
it's just you and me, man, like it's always been.
I got to ask you something, Little Boy.
I need to know the truth. Of course.
you'd never lift a finger to hurt my son, would you?
never threaten him?
this coming from Allison? Man.
come on, man. You know she never liked our relationship.
just answer.
never.
all right? Not ever.
thanks for the pickup. Mm-hmm.
the Tallahassee marshals just missed him.
so what are these two low-rent thugs doing in Florida?
the stash, okay?
Darrington e-mailed me the info on Little Boy's cellmate.
his name is Tony Diaz. The guy's from Cedar Key, Florida.
big-time drug dealer. Real estate investor.
and he's an overall scumbag. Hmm.
sounds like a rich scumbag.
Yeah, and Little Boy's always talking about the stash.
well, if Diaz was big league, he would have money hidden for a rainy day.
so maybe the rumor about Little Boy hanging his cellmate is true.
he waits, he gets out...
disappears forever.
cedar Keys, Florida
the promised land.
the view's nice. Yeah.
tomorrow as soon as it's light, we'll go look for that money.
for now, how about some cool drinks, huh?
who you calling, Francis?
I'm turning myself in.
not you-- Just me.
so you should get out of here.
look, I didn't do right by you. I know that.
not when Dad died.
not when you went to prison.
somebody should have been there for you.
which is what I want for Kevin, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I understand. That's your son.
so we cool?
we are.
I'm sorry, Francis.
cedar Keys PD found Francis' body floating in the harbor.
stabbed in the side.
family-- You can't choose it, can't escape it.
I looked up Diaz's property records.
I'm not sure where this stash is, but his house was seized and sold.
so's his vacation home.
yeah? But not his luxury boat. Diaz never bought a boat.
I looked into his real estate company. They own a boat.
pretty good way to hide a title. Where's it moored?
it was at Pelican Harbor. Same place they found Francis' body.
but the harbor master it left ten minutes ago headed south down the coast.
let's call the DEA, Coast Guard, whoever can get us a boat faster.
head towards the cove.
can we get to him before he lands?
this is all we got? That's it.
full throttle.
either of you got a shot?
you can take out the engine? Sure as hell try.
nice shot. I impress every once in a while.
I guess you do.
I don't see him.
where the hell did he go?
he's got to be below deck.
stop shooting or we will return fire.
come out, hands up.
I can't... I can't...
I can't hear!
come on out. I want to see your hands.
let me see your hands.
I can't see! I can't see!
Hey, Annie, Hank Lacy's outside.
he wants to shake your hand.
turn around.
I said turn around.
dad.
what's the matter, sunshine?
you afraid?
no.
why haven't you found me yet?
takes time.
maybe you're not sure you really want to find me.
you recognize this, don't you?
that's Mom's ring.
why didn't you send this to me.
you know why.
something bad is about to happen.
Hello?
Nancy?
exactly.
but at least be honest about the facts.
that's what I'm saying. - Who's honest?
I'm honest.
I am honest about what I write about.
I'll let you know if it's autobiographical, or if it's about me, or if it's not.
and I find autobiographical stories at this juncture of my life to be quite boring.
...say I'm one thing, but actually you're another thing.
I think being true to who you are is important.
I'm not saying you need to be psychoanalytical about the whole mess.
but don't be afraid. - Yeah, I... But don't be afraid.
I had lunch with Jimmy Baldwin the other day.
how is he? - He's a lovely man.
and he told me the plot of his new book.
and he said to me, "But I just want to make sure it's not one of those problem novels.
and I said, "Jimmy...
your novel's about a Negro homosexual who's in love with a Jew.
wouldn't you call that a problem?"
and he looked at me and he laughed because he knew I was right.
I'm saying, you know, if you're gonna write something like that...
at least be honest why you're writing it.
can't we just be honest?
well, I don't think you actually need to be honest.
but don't come asking some white man from the South...
whether your book about a black man fucking some Jew when they're both of the same sex is an issue!
don't ask me that!
Oh, no, it's not an issue, Jimmy.
everyone's gonna be quite pleased with that topic.
so how about you, Truman? Do you admit it?
well, I'm not nearly that controversial.
I'm not! I'm not! I am not.
I'm not nearly that controversial.
Oh, come on.
Hi. It's Truman for William Shawn, please.
have you read the article about the killings in Kansas in the front section of The New York Times?
I think that's what I want to write about.
I want to go tonight.
I figured you'd missed it. - I'm sorry.
that's all right. I thought I was heading to Kansas by myself.
God, I'm glad you agreed to come.
you're the only one I know with the qualifications...
to be both a research assistant and a personal bodyguard.
thank you.
now I'm nervous.
yes?
Mr. Truman Capote and Miss Nelle Harper Lee?
that's us. - Where would you like these, sir?
you can put that right there between the doors.
what all did you bring?
just a few things.
thank you greatly, sir. - Thank you.
you're welcome.
it's an honor to have you with us, sir...
and I hope you won't mind me saying...
but I thought your last book was even better than the first.
thank you.
I mean, just when you think they've gotten as good as they can get.
thank you very much. - Ma'am.
you're pathetic.
what? - You paid him to say that.
you paid him to say that.
how did you know?
"just when you think they've gotten as good as they can get"?
I thought that was a good line.
do you think that was too much? - Yeah, a bit.
your keys.
sign here, please. - Thank you.
Alvin Dewey...
Kansas Bureau of Investigation.
Hi. I'm looking for Alvin Dewey.
Hi.
Mr. Dewey. Truman Capote, from The New Yorker.
Bergdorf's. - Sorry?
the scarf. - Oh.
nice. - Thank you.
Mr. Dewey, I wonder when we could arrange an interview, some time to talk.
about what?
well, we're not looking for any inside information.
you know, I don't care one way or another if you catch whoever did this.
I'm writing an article on how the Clutter killings are affecting the town.
you know, how you all are bearing up.
I care.
excuse me? - I care.
I care a great deal if we catch whoever did this.
Oh, I see.
as do a lot of folks around here. - Oh, of course.
do you have press credentials?
what's a New Yorker? - Magazine.
magazines don't give out...
you can come to the news conference with the rest of them.
sears, Roebuck.
the boy was 16?
he was 15.
Nancy was 16.
and it's her friend that found them?
Laura Kinney. - Can you spell that?
I assume you're okay with the Laura part.
K-l-N-N-E-Y.
but, please, leave her be.
there's talk of a bunch of Mexicans. A whole bunch of Mexicans.
Hello, George.
it's good to see you again.
I do have an opinion whether this was the work of one man or "a whole bunch," as you said...
but it doesn't matter a whole lot...
whether it was Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos.
we're gonna find whoever did this.
now, four good people from our community are dead.
so let's remember that.
the West Kansas Farm Committee...
is offering a $1, 000 reward...
for information leading to an arrest.
please print that.
and thank you all for coming.
he was foxy with that old man.
this make you miss Alabama?
not even a little bit.
you lie. - I don't lie.
good morning. - Hi.
can any of you tell me where I'd find Laura Kinney?
is that her? With the boy?
Yeah, with Danny Burke.
Danny Burke?
Laura?
thank you.
Truman.
I'm gonna find out where that girl lives.
can I do that alone?
all right?
okay.
I think I scared a friend of yours this morning.
she came looking for you when I was writing.
you hate my friends. - No, I wouldn't say "hate.
just as long as they don't knock on my door.
I saw the bodies today.
which? - The Clutters.
I looked inside the coffins.
that's horrifying.
it comforts me.
something so horrifying...
it's a relief.
normal life falls away.
but then, I was never much for normal life.
no.
Yeah, people here won't talk to me.
they want someone like you, like Nelle.
me, they hate.
I can't think of a single quality I share with Nelle.
well... - Maybe manliness.
good morning, Henry. - Good morning, sir.
let's go.
Bye.
Hi, Danny. I'm Harper Lee.
Nancy was your best friend?
Yeah, she was my best friend.
how has Danny been?
pretty shattered.
nothing terrible has ever happened to him before.
Danny was the last one at the house that night.
that's why Mr. Dewey keeps interviewing him.
they don't think that he had anything to do with it.
it's just to see if he remembers anything unusual.
people in town do seem to wonder if he was involved.
Yeah. That's been really hard for Danny.
Oh, it's the hardest when someone has a notion about you...
and it's impossible to convince them otherwise.
ever since I was a child, folks have thought they had me pegged...
because of the way I...
the way I am.
you know, the way I talk.
and they're always wrong.
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
I wanna show you something.
maybe this will give you a better picture of what happened.
what is this? - It's your diary.
Danny here tonight and we watched TV.
so nice just having him sit with us.
left at 11: 00.
P. S. He's the only one I really love.
and that was that.
did Laura say "shattered"?
pretty shattered. Nothing terrible has ever happened to him before.
you know I have 94% recall of all conversations?
I've tested myself.
well...
how did that happen?
apparently Detective Foxy's wife has read fiction.
that's great.
we're in.
we are in. - In.
you came. - Hi.
thank you for having us. - Thank you.
get yourselves in here.
Alvin, get your pants on. They're here.
Hey, little Deweys. - Hi.
Hi.
shake it with your wrist.
use your whole arm.
more.
you think I'm kidding around, but I'm serious.
mama would've put in half the bottle. She had to buy it by the crate.
Alvin's gonna hate this.
I have to stop.
Oh, I cannot believe you're from New Orleans.
I miss it so much.
well, I only lived there for a short while, but my mama was born and bred.
you know something?
Alvin pretends he doesn't know who you are, but the minute you came to town...
he read your books. - No!
he had one of his men pick up Breakfast at Tiffany's in Kansas City...
cause it's banned in the library here.
and he said, "I feel like you're spiting me.
I said, "Do you think I took this job to spite you?
I was writing the script as they were filming, all that time in Italy...
and I'd work like mad all day long...
and then dash down to the bar around midnight...
to hand in the next day's scenes.
and Humphrey had just about moved into the hotel bar...
Humphrey Bogart.
...where he and John...
John Huston.
...had...
they drank every night.
and I mean drank, you know, like famished water buffaloes.
well...
I'd only just handed them the final scene when the bellhop told me I had a phone call.
and it was my stepfather, Joe Capote...
calling to say that my mother had died.
I flew home to New York, terribly distraught...
but when I got to the apartment...
I could see that Joe was in even worse shape than I was.
he grabbed my hand and he said to me...
"talk."
"talk about anything." You know?
I mean, any subject in the world.
don't worry whether it'll interest me or not.
just talk...
so I won't break down.
he couldn't bear to be alone with his thoughts.
it was too painful.
it's been a hard couple of weeks for Alvin.
he and Herb Clutter were good friends from church.
Oh, Marie.
Oh, come on, Alvin. These are good people.
why would they put a pillow under the boy's head just to shoot him?
why would they tuck Nancy in?
so many of my friends would love to meet you.
Oh, that'd be fine. - You don't have to worry...
cause I'm not going to write about this till everything's over.
well, I'm not worried.
I know what room you're in at the hotel, and I know where you live in Brooklyn.
you're celebrating.
well, remember Nelle's manuscript she sent me in New York?
Yeah. Mockingbird. Killing a Mockingbird.
you said it was good. - And I was right.
she just heard Lippincott wants to publish it.
well, Jesus.
Jesus, well, that's terrific. Tell her congratulations from me.
Congratulations.
thank you. - Jealous.
will you be home by Christmas? - I wanna come home.
I wanna come home. I do. I just...
thought if they catch whoever did this, who knows what?
I'll probably be here till next Christmas. - I'm gonna let you go.
I...
no, don't go.
we'll go away next spring to write.
maybe Spain. - Yeah.
okay, I'm gonna let you go. - Jack...
Jack, I promise. We'll go away this spring to write.
maybe Spain. - Okay.
all right.
my wife worked there, too.
what did she do in the house?
cleaning. Cooking a little bit.
quiet, quiet. Quiet, quiet.
girdle up. No extra bulges.
if you're dressed right, when he gets home...
the rest of the evening should be smooth sailing.
bon voyage, gals.
I can't believe you got that whole page. I only read it once.
I've tested my... - Tested myself.
I have 94%... - Percent recall.
cut that out. - Cut that out.
cut that...
cut that out.
isn't that something, Alvin?
Oh, it's impressive.
thank you.
I'm sorry. He's upset. - What's he upset about?
they know who did it.
two men.
you know, they passed through Kansas City last week writing bad checks.
by the time Alvin's boys got up there, they were gone.
skipped out.
Yeah. They don't know where.
no idea.
one of them had a cellmate who gave him up for the $1, 000 reward.
do they know the name of the cellmate?
no. No, I don't know. Alvin knows.
I guess this isn't the appropriate time to go ask him.
he's beside himself.
Hello?
Alvin, get in here.
dad, it's the telephone. - Not now, Alvin.
God damn it.
get over here.
dad! - Alvin, not now.
sit.
dad? Dad?
you need to call the Chief of Police in Las Vegas.
Alvin, what'd you say? - He said you need to call them immediately.
truman Capote. - Dorothy Sanderson.
I figured you'd be left alone this morning by that hardworking husband of yours...
so I have breakfast, and I have news, and I have literature.
my friend, Jack, mailed me that book you wanted...
and I inscribed it myself.
to the maiden of the Midwest, the priestess of the plains...
the queen of the kitchen, my first novel. Truman.
you're too much. Come on in. - Oh, thank you.
go into the living room. Have a seat.
let me get that. It's been ringing all morning.
Hello?
Truman, I meant in here.
that's the women's cell.
it's hardly ever used, but they wanted them separate.
let's sit in the living room.
they put you in the women's cell.
do you have any aspirin?
my legs.
Truman?
please.
I'm sorry.
in the matter of the State of Kansas v. Richard Eugene Hickock...
and Perry Edward Smith...
this court has been informed by counsel, Mr. Weeks...
that the defendants wish to waive their right to a preliminary hearing.
his mind is somewhere else.
Mr. Hickock, is that your wish?
Yes, sir.
why are they doing that?
Mr. Smith.
I ask that the waiver be effectuated.
Effectuated?
so noted.
remove the prisoners.
was it your choice to waive the hearing?
do you still need some?
give me your hand.
I could kill you if you got too close.
now, would you like some water, or...
Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book.
he said we'd curry favor with the judge if we waived our rights.
who did?
the lawyer.
your picture's undignified.
people recall first impressions.
what's been your first impression?
hello.
Mr. Shawn. - Truman.
I'm writing a book.
it's too much for a single article.
this town, the killers most of all.
you will be stunned by Perry Smith.
why, what's happening?
well, not much yet, but I know. I can sense him.
he's desperately Ionely, frightened.
I have a question.
are you ready?
would it matter? - No.
how much more money can you send me?
and how quickly could you get Dick Avedon out here to take some pictures?
who are you smiling at right now?
I'm smiling at you.
you know, Dick's a very famous fashion photographer.
world-famous.
am I gonna be in a fashion magazine?
so there's no worry of having a bad picture.
who were you closer to, your mom or your dad?
what's that? - Who were you closer to...
your mom or your dad? - Well, both.
yeah? - Yeah.
have you talked to them? - Yeah.
who'd you talk to first?
Perry, honey, you look terrific, baby.
that was good.
can you show us the tattoo on your chest then?
Yeah.
where did Perry get the art set?
members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
Yes, sir.
defendants, rise.
Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene Hickock...
you stand accused of four counts of the crime of murder in the first degree.
have you reached a unanimous verdict?
we have, Your Honor.
what is your verdict?
guilty on all four counts.
have you unanimously reached a sentence?
we have, Your Honor.
what is the sentence?
death.
I need to see him before we go.
Perry.
they're going to transfer you up to Lansing today.
you'll have to make sure to put me on the visitors list.
otherwise I can't see you.
I'm going to help find you a proper lawyer.
you need a serious lawyer for an appeal.
now they took Dick last night.
and I need you to get him to do the same thing...
and just put me on the visitors list.
and I thought, "Where does the family eat?" You know?
I mean, does he, like, reach his hand through the bars...
and have dinner with everyone around the table?
Nelle, kudos on... Kill the Bird, is it?
that's close. Thank you. - That's marvelous. Who's your publisher?
Lippincott. - Yes. It's a children's book, right?
Yes. - No, no. It's about children.
Yes. - Yes, I've heard a lot about it.
good. - Congratulations.
thank you. - I didn't even know she wrote.
he's sad and he's shy.
and he's terrified.
they shotgunned the entire family in the face.
and I thought, at first, "I'm gonna be scared of these men."
I'm gonna run, run right home.
actually, the brother in the family...
kenyon is his name...
they had placed a pillow under his head...
and then shot him point-blank in the face.
almost as if they were putting him to sleep...
and then shot him.
this is the start of a great love affair.
Yeah. Truman in love with Truman.
the book I'm writing will return him to the realm of humanity.
it's the book I was always meant to write.
well, he hasn't actually written a word of it yet...
but he says it's the nonfiction book of the decade...
so...
so...
what have you been doing?
and I'll tell you...
I was in Marilyn's apartment just last week, talking about movies, art.
finally I had to break it to her that of the four Matisses hanging on her wall...
two were upside down.
can I have another, please?
to answer your question, I'm following Breakfast at Tiffany's...
by blazing a different path.
by inventing an entirely new kind of writing.
the nonfiction novel.
you have a subject? - Yes.
on the night of November 14...
two men broke into a quiet farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family.
now, why did they do that?
two worlds exist in this country.
the quiet, conservative life, and the life of those two men.
the underbelly. The criminally violent.
and those worlds converged that bloody night.
now, I spent the past three months...
interviewing everyone in Kansas touched by that violence.
now I spent hours talking to the killers...
and I'll spend more.
cause researching this work has changed my life.
you know, it's altered my point of view about almost everything.
Yeah.
and I think those who read it will be similarly affected.
so you find them a new lawyer.
well, they're facing execution in six weeks.
you know, they need someone to argue whether or not that's right.
okay.
and I'd also like to see them alive.
well... - Yeah.
Yeah, I need to hear their stories.
well, just be careful what you do to get what you want.
I'm finding them a lawyer.
Truman, you're finding yourself a lawyer. - No, I'm finding them a lawyer.
there's a difference.
the Warden will see you now.
well, we do all right by our boys.
showers once a week. Feed them good.
we'll be feeding Perry Smith in the infirmary soon if he don't eat.
try and get the food in through his arm.
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?
well, he hasn't eaten in a month.
it ain't his right to kill himself.
it's the right of the people.
the people of this state.
and that's who I work for, the people.
no one told me. - Yeah, he won't eat.
when can I see him? - Well, let me see.
how about you coming 3: 00, Thursday afternoon?
no.
that's no good.
I need to see them now.
then whenever I want, for as long as I want.
well, that's just not how we do things around here, Mr. Capote.
Yeah, I understand what a burden unlimited visitation might be on this institution and on the people who pay for it.
and I want to be clear...
that I don't expect the citizens of Leavenworth County to have to shoulder that burden.
this is to be dispensed as you see fit.
you know, I didn't know where to count your boy at first...
him being half-lndian.
but I did him a favor. I counted him as a white man.
you're a kind and generous man.
spread your feet.
this way.
Hey, hey. - Yeah, hello.
Hey, thanks a lot for your help with the lawyer.
Oh, that's fine.
Wow. You must be really desperate for a story to come all the way out here.
you want to go see Perry, go ahead.
thank you.
you want my advice, though, Mr. Capote...
he's just trying to prove the insanity defense.
it's okay.
it's okay.
it's Truman. It's your friend.
it's okay.
this is before she had us.
before she started drinking.
who took care of you as a child?
orphanage.
me and Linda.
and that's your sister?
you know, we're not so different as you might think.
Yeah, I was abandoned repeatedly as a child.
my mama would drag me along to some new town...
so she could take up with another man she'd met.
night after night, she'd lock me in the hotel room alone.
mama would turn the latch and tell the staff not to let me out no matter what.
and I was terrified.
and I'd scream my head off...
until finally I'd collapse on the carpet next to the door and I'd fall asleep.
then after years of this...
she just left me...
with relatives in Alabama.
who raised you up?
my aunts.
and that's where I met Nelle.
and she lived next door.
your mother was Indian?
Cherokee.
so drinking was not a good thing for her.
no tolerance for it.
we're on suicide watch.
that's why they leave the lights on at night.
I hope we're past that now.
I do.
be careful of Ricardo.
I think he wants you all to himself.
all right.
but he's naturally mendacious.
not to be trusted.
if he had $100, he'd steal a stick of chewing gum.
Perry, I want to take your notebooks with me.
I want to read them.
if I leave here without understanding you...
the world will see you as a monster...
always.
I don't want that.
cause he trusts me. I mean, that's why he gave it to me.
and he's given me absolutely everything.
and he wants so badly to be taken seriously...
to be held in some esteem.
do you?
do I what?
do you hold him in esteem, Truman?
well...
he's a gold mine.
and he's told me his entire life.
his dead mother.
he had a brother and a sister kill themselves.
awful.
did you tell him your mama did the same thing?
see, I can't tell him everything.
we've been talking our heads off for the past month.
and sometimes...
when I think how good my book can be, I can hardly breathe.
anyway, this is what I wanted to read to you.
"if called upon to make a speech..."
"if called upon to make a speech"?
I mean, this is exactly what I'm talking about.
a speech, just in case he's ever recognized for an achievement.
I can't remember what I was going to say for the life of me.
I don't think ever before have so many people been so directly responsible for my being so very, very glad.
it's a wonderful moment and a rare one.
thank you!
there's an exclamation point at the end of that "thank you..."
in case you didn't catch it.
Where'd you go?
I guess it stopped being funny.
I never said it was.
wait, listen to this.
I was 14.
one day I said to her, "Mom's dead." I could see it.
a week later we got the news. She finally drunk herself...
found her shivering...
she hit me so many times with that flashlight...
she broke it.
that night, I dreamed about that big yellow bird.
clawed that nun's eyes, bright like the sun.
lifted me to the sky.
sometimes you see a thing how it really is.
well, you're nothing if not hardworking.
Hey, you look good. Healthy again.
you know, I've decided on a title for my book.
I think you'll like it.
it's very masculine.
in Cold Blood.
isn't that good?
and that refers to the crime or the fact that you're still talking to the criminals?
the former, among other things.
I see.
I wanted to ask...
if you'd let me look at your investigation notes.
that lawyer you helped find for your friends...
got them a hearing at the Kansas Supreme Court...
I heard this morning.
...on the issue of inadequate counsel.
Alvin...
I mean, do you not want me to look at your notes?
you are permitted to say no.
I'll tell you what.
if those boys get off...
I'm coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down.
I have to be in court at 9: 00...
but you call Roy Church and he'll show you what you want to see.
thank you.
it's as much for me as for anyone.
I couldn't bear the thought of losing you so soon.
we're gonna be able to use your book for our case.
you'll write we never got to raise an insanity plea.
you wrote how terrible the lawyers was.
I haven't written a word yet.
what have you been doing?
research. Talking to you.
all right.
I had hoped... - What are you calling it?
the book?
I have no idea.
Perry...
if I'm going to write about you...
if I'm going to determine how to write about you...
we need to talk about...
you know, why you're here.
you know, the murders...
and that night...
at the Clutter house.
do you worry what I'll think?
is that it?
Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor.
I know a lot of people.
Perry, I have invitations to be in Morocco, Greece...
and I prefer to be here...
with you.
Jack, be patient with me.
I'm just missing this one piece.
well, how long is that gonna take?
why don't you just try leaving him alone for a while?
come to Spain.
you can always visit him later.
I don't know.
well, I'm off. I'm just... I've got my own writing to do.
well, do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.
there's too many people around. I've...
I'll leave the address on the kitchen table.
well, think about what I said, and join me when you can.
I will.
I will. - Okay?
Bye.
Hi.
Truman.
we never intended on killing that family.
Capote, will you get that straight in your book, please?
no premeditation.
what are you doing?
I have to fly back East.
when?
an hour. I miss you already.
write me every five minutes.
Hey, you know, we never did intend on killing that family.
Capote?
Capote?
what?
Truman...
I've not been able to tear myself away from your book.
it's that good.
it's not good, it's astonishing.
this first half is astonishing. - Oh, thank you.
when will you be done, do you think?
Yes, I'm already well into the third part.
but...
I can't finish that till I convince Perry to describe the night of the killings to me.
I was planning to visit this fall, see?
then I think you need to talk to him now.
and we all need to see how this ends for the final part.
I can't finish the book till I know what happens.
if Perry and Dick are executed, it's one thing.
and if not, well...
Truman, you got your ending.
I really don't know.
the Kansas Court denied their appeal.
it came over the wire on Friday.
I mean, you need to talk to Perry now.
he'll be dead by September.
I mean, I'm sorry.
I know how much you've come to care about him.
right. Yes, right.
so I want to set up a reading for you in the fall, in New York...
and, well, we'll build some interest, and we'll publish in the fall.
thank God. There's nothing in the house.
why aren't you working?
well, I knew you couldn't be counted on to stock the kitchen.
what are we going to feed our famous guest?
Oh, Jesus, I completely forgot.
Plus, I finished my novel yesterday.
what?
when was the last time you wrote to him?
I don't know.
what's this?
it's a letter for Truman I was asked to deliver.
it's from Perry.
let's have it.
dear friend Truman, where are you?
read this item in a medical dictionary.
death by hanging is caused by asphyxia...
by fracture of the cervical vertebrae...
by laceration of the trachea.
not too comforting, as we lost our appeal.
missing you.
alone and desirous of your presence.
your amigo, Perry.
Mr. Shawn told me about the court decision yesterday.
I was wondering why you were in such a good mood.
that's a terrible thing to say.
I write him all the time. I've just...
I've been so focused on the book lately.
so Jack thinks I'm using Perry...
but he also thinks I fell in love with him when I was in Kansas.
now, how both of those things can be true is beyond me.
thank you.
well, did you?
did you fall in love with him?
I don't know how to answer that.
Truman.
it's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house...
and one day he stood up and went out the back door...
while I went out the front.
are you kidding me? - No.
listen, you be nice to Jack.
sometimes I think he's what I like about you best.
I'll see you at the reading in New York.
16th. - 16th.
Adios.
what was he in jail for?
well, they said it was for not paying his taxes...
but really, for being an outsider.
refusing to go along.
Lowell, you're being moved.
Why? - You're going to final holding.
no.
come on, Lowell. Open the door.
stand up.
put your arms behind your back. - Okay, last chance.
get up.
turn around. Put your arms behind your back.
now Dick and me, we're next in line.
I'm so sorry I've been away.
it was a long time.
I know.
how's the book coming along?
very slowly.
will you show it to me?
I've hardly written anything.
good evening, New Yorkers...
and thank you for coming to the first public reading...
the first offering of any kind of Truman Capote's new work, In Cold Blood.
hello. My name is Truman Capote.
for this evening's program, I'm going to read some passages...
from the first three parts of my new book.
the village of Holcomb stands on the high wheat plains of western Kansas...
a Ionesome area that other Kansans call 'out there. '
until one morning in mid-November, 1959...
few Americans, in fact, few Kansans, had ever heard of Holcomb.
like the waters of the Arkansas River...
like the motorists on the highway...
exceptional happenings never stopped there.
Perry Smith's voice was both gentle and prim.
a voice that, though soft...
manufactured each sound exactly...
ejected it like a smoke ring issuing from a parson's mouth.
the four coffins, which quite filled the small, flower-crowded parlor...
were to be sealed at the funeral services...
very understandably...
for the effect was disquieting.
Nancy wore her dress of cherry-red velvet...
her brother a bright plaid shirt.
the parents were more sedately attired...
Mr. Clutter in navy-blue flannel, his wife in navy-blue crepe.
and it was this especially that lent the scene an awful aura...
the head of each was completely encased in cotton.
a swollen cocoon twice the size of an ordinary blown-up balloon.
and the cotton...
because it had been sprayed with a glossy substance...
twinkled like Christmas tree snow.
one Tuesday at dawn, a carload of strangers...
ignorant of the local disaster...
were startled by what they saw as they crossed the prairies and passed through Holcomb.
windows ablaze.
almost every window in almost every house...
and in the brightly-lit rooms, fully-clothed people...
even entire families...
who had sat the whole night wide awake, watchful, listening.
of what were they frightened?
it might happen again.
thank you.
and I slipped and I ripped a hole...
from the bottom of my scrotum...
all the way up to the top of the crack of my ass.
and I sat there.
and I didn't know it. All I felt was a...
I didn't know it. All I felt was a cool breeze, you know, between my...
sorry. If I may...
Yes.
your portrait of those men was terrifying.
terrifying.
thank you.
stop that man! Come back here!
dad!
have any of you met my father?
he hasn't spanked me in years.
george didn't come backstage.
he had... He had a...
something that his wife had to rush him off to.
but he made a point of... - Well, I'm still waiting for a call.
it was beautiful. And everybody came. Everybody came.
Tennessee loved it. - Of course he loved it.
should we do more?
no, we just sit and wait while people talk about it...
and we let them do the work.
I mean, this book is going to change everything.
it's gonna change how people see your writing.
I think it's going to change how people write.
are you gonna be finished by October? - I think so.
you know, they're scheduled for next month.
to hang.
Yeah.
we're gonna commit as many issues as it takes to publish.
whatever it takes.
well, I'm going to Kansas tomorrow...
and I'll get Perry to talk. - What's he got to lose?
sorry, but...
Hey, this may sound strange to you...
but I'm going to miss him.
you'll be able to finish now.
need to check your papers, sir.
this is what we've been waiting for.
a stay of execution to make a federal appeal.
all thanks to you.
thank you!
they're not gonna corner me now. Not unless the U. S. Government says so.
Kansas has had it in for me for 10 years. They can't corner me now.
Hey, Perry, sit down...
for a minute.
I need you to talk to me.
we've got all the time in the world to talk.
I've been thinking about Ricardo.
you really need to stop sending him those trashy books.
I won't even mention the pornography.
now, I realize that Dick probably can't grasp the literature that you gave me.
and the books you send him only...
they only exacerbate the problem.
they only heighten or intensify it.
maybe we can get him started on a program.
Perry, I know what "exacerbate" means.
okay, well, just thinking...
there's not a word or a sentence or a concept that you can illuminate for me.
there is one singular reason I keep coming here.
Truman. - November 14, 1959.
three years ago. Three years.
and that's all I want to hear from you.
now I asked you not to. Ever.
this is absurd. Do you know what absurd means?
I'm ready. I have a plane to catch.
I found your sister in Tacoma.
maybe she'll talk to me about something useful.
please don't go out there.
Hey, this is my work, Perry. I'm working.
and when you want to tell me what I need to hear, you let me know.
june's dead. Frank shot himself.
now Perry did what he did.
I used to love him. He was my little doll.
he scares me now.
when was the last time you saw him? - Ten years ago.
ten years.
could I borrow one of these pictures?
take the whole thing. I don't want them anymore.
don't be taken in by my brother. He's got this sensitive side he'll show.
you believe he's gentle and so easily hurt...
but he'd just as soon kill you as shake your hand. I believe that.
Hello, handsome.
what's the name of your book?
what's the name of your book?
I don't know what you're talking about.
truman Capote read last night before a packed audience...
from his nonfiction book In Cold Blood.
the true-crime novel tells of killers Richard Hickock...
and Perry Smith...
who brutally murdered a Kansas family three years ago.
wait, who sent that to you? - That's not your goddamn business.
it is my business, because it's not true.
the organizers of the reading needed a title.
they picked one, a sensational one, I admit...
to attract a crowd.
they picked it? - Yes.
it's not your title. - Perry, I haven't chosen one yet.
how could I choose a title when we still haven't talked about that night?
how could I? I couldn't possibly.
you pretended to be my friend.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.
and I couldn't pretend to be your friend...
cause the truth is, I can't help wanting to be.
you don't have to tell me anything...
if you don't want to.
I have something from your sister.
she misses you.
look at my belly.
there must be something wrong with us, to do what we did.
we heard there was $10, 000 in that house.
once we tied up everybody and searched all over...
I knew the guy that told us about it was wrong.
there was no money.
Dick wouldn't believe it...
so he went tearing through the house, banging on the walls...
Iooking for a safe.
when he was done...
he said he was gonna go up to Nancy's room and have his way with her.
I wouldn't allow it.
and I told him that.
so I sat with her.
Dick came up and got me.
we turned off the lights and went down to the basement...
where Mr. Clutter and the boy was.
he kept saying, "No witnesses..."
but I figured if I waited him out, he'd...
he'd give up and we'd leave them tied up there.
and we'd drive all night. They'd never find us.
we tied Mr. Clutter's wrists to a pipe over his head.
and he looked hurt, so I cut him down.
I put a box out there so he'd be more comfortable.
he asked how his wife and daughter was and I said they were fine...
and they were getting ready for sleep, and it wouldn't be long...
till morning when they'd find him.
he was just looking at me.
looking into my eyes.
like he expected me to kill him.
like he expected me to be the kind of person who would kill him.
I was thinking, "This nice man is scared of me."
I was so ashamed.
I mean, I thought he was a very nice...
gentle man.
and I thought so right up till I slit his throat.
I didn't know what I did till I heard the sound.
added up...
how much money did you get from the Clutters that night?
between $40 and $50.
I mean, the truth is, I'm desperate to be done with it.
I've spent four years of my life on this book.
they got a stay of execution yesterday.
another, yes.
supreme Court.
it's harrowing.
me, all I want to do is to write the ending and there's no end in sight.
no, thank you.
dear friend Truman, haven't heard from you in such a long while.
please help find new lawyer.
if not, Dick will have to write the Supreme Court brief himself.
our last appeal. What a pair of wretched creatures.
please help. Your amigo?
Perry.
just put it with the others.
you know, at least for Nelle...
you should try and pretend you're having a good time tonight.
I thought I'd find you here.
Oh, Nelle.
thank you.
I'll have another, please.
how are you? - Terrible.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I mean, it's torture the way...
what they're doing to me.
and now it's the Supreme Court.
and can you believe it?
if they win this appeal...
I will...
have a complete nervous breakdown.
I may never recover...
and I'll just pray that it turns my way.
it must be difficult. - It's torture.
they're torturing me.
I see.
and how'd you like the movie, Truman?
I frankly don't see what all the fuss is about.
hello.
Mr. Truman Capote? - Yeah.
I have a call from Mr. Perry Smith in the Kansas Correctional System.
will you accept charges?
Yes.
Mr. Smith, you're on the line.
hello.
Hello?
Hello, Perry.
they let me make a couple of phone calls before I go down to holding.
you heard the Supreme Court rejected the appeal?
no, I didn't. I hadn't heard that.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. They let me make two phone calls.
we got a date set for the warehouse, Dick and me.
two weeks and finito.
april 14.
will you visit me?
Truman?
it's him again.
it is utterly inappropriate for me to talk to him.
yes?
I'm sorry, he won't be able to make it.
Hello? - Mr. Shawn, it's Nelle.
I just got this telegram. Has he seen it?
he won't read it.
would you put him on, please? - Nelle, he won't talk.
Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him down and put the phone on his ear...
I need to speak to him.
all right.
it's Nelle.
Truman.
miss Nelle Harper Lee and Truman Capote.
sorry that Truman was unable to make it here to the prison...
for a brief word prior to necktie party.
whatever his reason for not showing up...
I want him to know that I cannot condemn him for it.
not much time left...
but want you both to know that I've been sincerely grateful...
for your friendship through the years and everything else.
I'm not very good at these things.
I have become extremely affectionate toward you both.
but, harness time.
Adios, amigos. Your friend, Perry.
well, I didn't expect to see you again.
you can visit for a few minutes.
Yeah. - No.
five minutes.
well, well.
he returns.
I don't know what you must think of me.
well, you haven't been foremost on my mind lately...
as you can probably imagine.
you got the letter?
Yes, I did.
it's true. I understand why you didn't want to come.
I wouldn't be here either if I didn't have to.
you got that right.
you know Ricardo donated his eyes to science?
next week, some blind man will be seeing what Dick used to see.
Yeah, you could be walking in Denver or somewhere, Truman...
and suddenly these eyes will be staring at you.
that would be something, wouldn't it?
it would be. It would be.
you'll be watching?
I don't know, I'll be...
do you want me to?
I'd like to have a friend there.
okay. Then I will.
it's all right.
I did everything I could.
it's okay.
I truly did.
I know.
it's time.
Mr. Capote.
goodbye.
you're not rid of us yet.
we'll see you in a few minutes. - I wish I had...
Mr. Capote.
Mr. Capote. - Goodbye.
nice to see you.
Perry Edward Smith.
for the crime of murder in the first degree, by order of the Court of Finney County...
and the Supreme Court of the sovereign state of Kansas...
you are sentenced to hang until you die.
I will fear no evil: For thou art with me.
thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
you can say something if you want.
is there anybody from the family here?
no, Perry.
well, tell them...
I can't remember what I was gonna say for the life of me.
our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
give us this day our daily bread.
and forgive those who trespass against us.
and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
it was a terrible experience...
and I will never get over it.
they're dead, Truman. You're alive.
and there wasn't anything I could have done to save them.
maybe not...
but, the fact is, you didn't want to.
I think he's dead.
don't ever, under any circumstance known to God, speak about this again.
what are you waiting for?
when you leave a man for dead, make sure he's really dead.
bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
it's been a year since my last confession.
I've never told anyone this.
not my mom, not the police, not even my friends.
except for the ones who were there.
they're not around anymore.
you see, I... - Yes?
I killed a man.
but it was a terrible accident.
I've tried to get past it, but I can't.
go on.
I have these dreams.
really horrible dreams.
this man is always there with me.
he was a killer. He murdered Barry and Helen.
he would have killed me too, but I got away with it.
I guess I just need to deal with it.
face the tear and the guilt.
finally say his name.
Ben Willis.
I know.
you know?
how could you...
I know what you did last summer.
nice to see you find political science so stimulating, Miss James.
sorry.
Julie, wait. You okay?
I'm fine. - You sure?
you don't seem tine. - I had another dream, Will.
the one in the shower? - No, in a church.
it was so real. I felt his breath. - I'm sorry.
I really thought the dreams were over. I hadn't had one for months.
it takes time. It'll get better. - It can't get much worse.
that's not the first time I freaked out in class.
I can't study. I don't get any sleep.
I am this close to tailing.
happy Fourth of July.
it was one year ago.
it's the anniversary.
that's what it is. Take it easy on yourself.
I'm really trying, but sometimes I wonder why I even came up here.
to get out of Southport?
right. Now I remember.
so, are you getting out of town for the Fourth?
no, I'll probably just be here studying for finals.
the joys to summer school. - Right.
are you okay? - I'm fine.
you sure? - Yes.
you're definitely okay? - Yes, I am definitely okay.
thanks for the talk.
you're good to me. - I am?
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Bye.
I got in early.
who was that guy?
that's my friend, Will. You'd like him. - Yeah.
we're just friends.
every guy in history who tried to pick up on a girl...
did the "good friend" thing first.
are you ready to go? I got my truck.
you know the drill. There's a crab boil at Ollie's...
a croaker queen pageant.
it's small-town fun, but nice.
I can't. - You can't what?
I feel like there's this small part of me that hasn't healed enough to go back.
please understand. - I understand.
it's not like that. It's not you.
it's all me, in my head.
I want to go back. I want to be tine. I want to be with you.
I want everything to be like it was. It just isn't.
why don't you stay up here?
fireworks over the river, a million things to do.
I have to work.
my boat's in Southport, remember?
but it's cool.
you need your space from croaker land then...
probably from me too.
I'm scared, that's all.
shit.
what are you doing in my closet? - I thought you were out of town.
what the hell are you doing in my closet?
I wanted to borrow your black skirt, but I'm not ready to die for it.
Jesus, Karla, that was heart attack time.
can I have the knife, please?
you should come out with me tonight. - I don't think so.
I just tried to stab you with a knife. I hardly feel like dancing.
what's the matter?
I just hurt Ray's feelings.
listen to me. Ray is a great guy.
nothing against old Ray, but he's so Ray.
he lives in Southport.
will is a nice guy who lives right down the street.
Yeah, but there's nothing between Will and me.
nothing yet.
we have to keep moving.
I'm working at the club tonight, and you, dancing queen, are coming with me.
no, I'm not. - Yes, you are.
what did I say?
you know what I want to do to you.
right? - No, I'm not aware of that.
there's got to be a place in here we can be alone.
baby, I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
come on, baby. Don't be like that.
I just want to talk to you for a minute.
it you can say all you have to say to me in a minute, I don't want to hear it.
I'll talk real, real slow.
not at work. Do me a favor. Ask Julie to dance.
Jules, you're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight.
ty, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
you better recognize.
that's how my species survives.
you'll never convince me otherwise.
so what's up? Want to dance? - Say yes.
no. - No means yes. Don't listen to her.
ty, I really appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance?
we do the mouth thing, snap the fingers.
worse come to worse, you can just stand there and watch me.
I have an idea. Why don't we all take a break and go dance?
leave the tray there. - Let's go.
what do you know? Will Benson looking fine.
did you tell him I would be here?
I told him you would absolutely not be at this bar between 10: 00 and 11: 00.
then he came anyway. Hi, Will.
what's up? - This wasn't my idea.
what? - I said this wasn't my...
let's go. - You'll be fine. Do your thing.
be good, Julie. - You want to get a drink?
Yeah.
go, Ty.
you see something back there? - Yeah.
I'm really sorry, but I've got to go home right now.
morning.
I love when they do that. - That could break the machine.
please.
that's Ty. Thanks.
my number's unlisted. - Will you relax?
we've been dating for three months, and he is not a stalker.
this is Mark in the Morning from Magic 96. 7 radio station.
who am I speaking with? - My God, it's Mark in the Morning!
put on the speakerphone.
Hi, Mark. I'm Karla Wilson.
why are you at home on this Fourth of July weekend?
I'm actually in school...
how would you like to win a getaway? - Hello, yeah!
you'll have to remember your geography because, to win, you need to...
tell me the capital of Brazil.
okay, the capital of Brazil.
come on. One easy question, one great getaway.
we need an answer. No looking it up.
okay, five seconds. - Five seconds.
four, three, two... - Rio.
rio de Janeiro!
did you say Rio?
yes? - You just won a quickie getaway!
we'll call you back with the details. What's your favorite radio station?
magic 96. 7!
that's what I thought.
who am I gonna take?
Tyrell, my parents, his cousins... - Wait a second, me.
mark said four tickets, so you have to think of someone to bring.
ray! Phone!
yeah?
I'm glad you called.
I'm sorry. - You shouldn't be sorry.
I shouldn't have left so fast.
I just...
ray, listen.
Karla just won a trip to the Bahamas...
this island called Tower Bay.
she wants us to go with her.
the Bahamas? Really?
it would be a great chance for us to hang out for the weekend.
you know, just sitting in the sun...
drinking fruity drinks, swimming and...
you know.
this weekend? - Yeah.
you can go away with your college friends, but you can't go away with me.
it's not you, it's Southport.
it's the Bahamas.
you know, free.
you have to sell his ass on the Bahamas?
I really want us to be together.
listen.
we're in the middle of a big run up here.
it's been crazy. We have to go back out again tonight.
I can't make it up.
will you try, for me, please?
Yeah, I'll try but... Listen.
if I don't make it up there, you go ahead.
have a great time.
for me, try, please. I really miss you.
I miss you too.
Bye.
dude, what is your problem?
we haven't caught dick for days.
pull that big stick out of your ass.
she asked you to go to the Bahamas. Fuck it, man. You gotta go.
I'll ride up with you, kick it with my homies in Cambridge.
Yeah. Stupid.
Yes, stupid.
what were you thinking, man?
I'll show you what I've been thinking.
whoa. Damn.
Thanks, but I'll need time to think about it.
nice fit. - Yeah.
I should tell Julie that I'm coming. - On the way.
surprise her. She'll be psyched.
Yeah.
all right, clean up.
will you please forget about Ray?
that boy has fish on the brains.
Yeah, but... - But nothing.
where are we going? - The Bahamas.
here I go again on my own
going down the only road I've ever known - Try the harmony. - You try the harmony. I'll lead.
you're going to lead? You suck.
fuck you, man. I sound just like the Dude. Listen.
and I've made up my mind
you don't sound anything like that guy.
are you deaf? - Fuck you.
I'm quitting this band, man.
going solo.
shit.
what are you doing? Let's just find a phone.
the guy looks dead.
maybe not.
what are you doing?
this is tucked-up, man.
shit.
Dave!
girl, it's getting down to the wire.
he's not coming.
I just thought...
you left him tour messages.
he said he'd try.
try" is like "maybe.
try" is bullshit.
he does work hard. - Work hard, my ass.
he's only breaking your heart because he can.
I don't want to say, "I told you so." - Then don't.
Oh, my God.
what's happening, lovers?
are we going to get tropical?
let me talk to you for a minute.
what's up?
please. I'm really sorry about Will.
he's my friend too...
and I don't want my ticket to go to waste.
so, where there's a Will, there's a way.
so let's start having fun now.
come on.
is there a problem?
there is no problem because we are all going to the Bahamas.
you goddamn right. Come on.
right, we are going to the Bahamas.
I shouldn't be in this row. - Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
take deep breaths.
think of something happy from your childhood.
what if I can't?
I just can't relax going 500 miles an hour.
deep breaths. - Fumes build up in the fuel tanks.
you can buy surface-to-air missiles over the Internet.
planes fall out of the sky for no reason at all.
you would have a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
planes get hit by lightning.
they get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
you gonna get hit, all right, if you don't quit bitching.
some folks just can't fly.
I'm the king of the world!
just breathe, Tyrell.
man, get away from me.
it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear.
you could have used the patch, but it's too late now.
you'll have to get used to it.
some folks just can't sail. - It's too bad too.
cause it's the only way on or oft the island.
unless you have an accident. Then they call the Coast Guard.
it looks pretty remote.
Yeah, but that's what tourists pay for: Sun, sea and solitude.
how much longer, man? - A few more minutes, kid.
hang in there. Don't hold back. Let it out.
just watch the boat. That way.
ladies, if there's anything I can do to make your stay more pleasurable...
please don't hesitate to ask.
my name is Darick, and I will be at your service...
for the duration of your stay, ladies.
listen, old man, I've gotta work fast.
the season's almost over.
if the radio's right about the weather, you're already out of time.
old man," my ass.
beautiful.
Wow. - Look at this.
we are here. We have arrived in paradise!
you gotta be shittin' me.
look at this cat. - What's up, my brother?
Tyrell, I think we found your brother. - I think we found your brother.
damn. You know what I was saying?
are you looking for some bud?
I got some bat guano. I got the cream jeans.
listen, anything you guys need, Titus got.
no, thank you. - What's up?
everybody needs something. What about the sweet young ladies?
is there anything I can do? - Take a bath.
damn, that's cold, woman.
listen, if you need some weed, I'll get with you later.
what's up?
was you looking for the disco? - Beat it.
hello.
God, where is everyone? - That's a good question.
excuse me.
I'll scare somebody up.
shit.
what can I do for you? - Checking in.
Yes, let's roll out the red carpet.
our contest winners are finally here.
last name first, first name last.
nice dog you got there, man. - Not really.
found pieces of guys like you in his stool.
you got a problem? - I don't have a problem in the world.
this is such a beautiful old hotel. Don't you think?
it was built in the 1930s for one of the Rockefeller clan.
the tiles are imported from Spain. There's a lot of history here.
Judy Garland stayed here.
president Nixon...
we understand. It's old.
it will outlive you.
put that down, please. - Sorry.
what? - You're in 201 and 202.
is that a bad thing? - No, not at all.
those are our honeymoon suites.
your what?
I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows?
we haven't exchanged anything.
Julie, we're talking suites.
that will be fine with us.
during your stay, our marginally trained...
off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
did you say, "off-season"?
it's the Fourth of July weekend.
the storm season begins today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
storm season"?
it's our version of winter.
that's 201, 202.
Scrabble and Parcheesi are in the lounge.
enjoy.
ain't nothing free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.
I wanted you guys to have a great trip.
baby, we will. Don't you worry about that.
we've got the whole island to ourselves.
it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect the whole weekend.
guys, this is us, 202.
the bags. - Yes.
201 and 202.
don't use these much.
why is that? - No reason in particular.
these are fancy rooms for kids your age.
we won a competition. - What did you have to do?
guess the capital of Brazil. - Rio, baby.
that's right. - Good for you, girl.
where should I put your bags?
you can put their stuff in there and ours back here.
Karla, you promised.
I also promised Tyrell.
Julie, what's up? You're killing me.
if it's cool, I can sleep on the couch.
that way they can practice that real honeymoon. I'll take this.
I've been doing this since before you were a gleam in your father's eye.
sure it's cool with you? - Yeah, as long as you don't snore.
if I get out of hand, you can toss something at me.
he looks pretty beat up.
Yeah, but he seems certain.
his friend was killed out on the highway by somebody named Ben Willis.
he said Willis had a hook on his hand and was driving a BMW.
look, there's no body. There's no other vehicle involved.
he fell asleep at the wheel, crashed his truck into an old guard rail.
he got thrown out into a ditch, and he's damn lucky.
he suffered severe head trauma.
after he rests up, it will probably all come back to him.
doctor, number three just flat-lined.
get me some help up here. I have a flat-line, room three.
shit.
this bar is... - Empty?
you boys lost?
Wow. A human being.
please, just tell me this isn't the bar scene.
you want a drink? - We didn't get dressed up for nothing.
you're dressed up?
all right, Will. Check this out, man.
we got planter's punch. We got a Singapore sling.
how about a mai-motherfucking-tai? - Mai-mothertucking-tai.
Yeah. - How about some ID?
I'm kidding.
the guy at the desk said it would be quiet, not dead.
I guess he didn't tell you this is... - The last day of the season.
Yes. - Yes, he told us.
so why are you still here?
that's none of your goddamn business.
I think I smell man trouble. - Yeah.
not anymore. - Did he dump you?
I shot him.
now, what you boys want is a Dark and Stormy.
a little Vernon's rum, a little ginger beer and splash of Tabasco.
it's good. Trust me.
am I bad? He's really great and kind of cute.
Yes, he is cute, and he has a crush on you.
But? - But I miss Ray.
I really do. I tried to call him.
you know what? Ray made up his own mind.
that means you're free to make up yours.
so for the next 48 hours, your smile is a frown turned upside down.
Really?
here comes my baby. - Hi.
you like the outfit? - No, I love it.
thank you. - What do you think?
it's a cool bar, right?
every bar looks the same once you've worked in one.
am I right, sister? - Got that right.
you look beautiful.
I'm Julie. This is Karla. - Nancy.
Hi. - Welcome to Tower Bay's...
most happening hot spot.
up in our room is gonna be the most happening hot spot.
four Dark and Stormies. - The drinks are here.
to a great weekend. - Yeah.
screw the weather. - Fuck it.
so what do you do around here for fun?
make fun of tourists, basically.
or I let them make fun of themselves.
karaoke. Perfect. - That's what I'm talking about.
don't even think about it. - I won't.
don't listen to them party poopers. You keep doing your thing.
this is not for me. This is for someone who really needs it.
so, one single with extra cheese.
Yes. - No.
what did I say?
come on.
Julie in the house. - Just do it.
ladies and gentlemen...
please give a round of applause for my very best friend.
get up here.
all right.
thank you, Karla. - You're welcome.
at first I was afraid I was petrified
kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
are you happy? Then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong. And I grew strong
and I learned how to get along
but now you're back from outer space
Hi, Will. I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave the key
if I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
Oh, now go
everyone's a goddamn singer.
just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
I don't know the lyrics. Hold on.
it's him.
what do you mean? - He did something to the screen.
what's up with the music? - What's wrong?
I swear to God, it said...
what are you talking about?
nothing.
what's the matter? - Where are you going?
shit.
my God! - It's my fault.
I am so sorry.
I shouldn't have... I didn't think.
this is so sweet. I'm sorry.
I scared you. I crossed the line.
you scared me, but I'm a little on edge.
sorry. - You don't have to apologize.
I'm the one, and I understand.
I'm just gonna take a walk.
are you sure?
Yeah.
I just really like you a lot.
I want you to have a great time.
I want you to be happy.
I'll just grab a few things here.
God, I'm sorry.
bounce, baby. - Baby, you know what?
what? - I've decided...
I'm gonna change my major to finance.
and I'm going to Wall Street. You know why?
why is that, lover? - Because that is the only way...
I can afford a big-ass bed like this.
show me some love on this big-ass bed.
a Jacuzzi.
come on, baby, don't go there. Stay right here.
baby, I spent 100 bucks on my new bathing suit.
even if it's just for you to pull it off...
I gotta wear it.
that's what I'm talking about.
you didn't mention that earlier, you sexy thing.
goddamn it, man. You scared the shit out of me.
you're living your life in tear, bro.
it's time for your passage into manhood.
what do you want?
hear me out. There's a kick-ass party on the mainland.
I'm saying we take the boat and get jiggy with it!
come on, man.
I gotta tie the boat. There's a storm coming.
then I'm going to bed. - And that's it?
that's all I got for today.
please, take the bake elsewhere. - All right.
be careful, please. - Bullshit. Listen, buddy.
you need to take a chill pill.
have a good time, bro. - I will, buddy.
damn it!
very funny, asshole.
man, give me a hand, would you?
long distance. - I need an international operator.
one moment, please.
come on.
housekeeping.
what? - Wait a second.
have you seen my hair tie? - Come on.
I'm sorry, baby. I just don't want to get my hair wet.
look, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi...
and, personally, I do not want to be talking about hair care.
don't get feisty. - "Feisty"?
it's too late for all that. 'Cause you know what?
we're miles away from anybody, so nobody can hear you scream.
I used to be a lifeguard.
please don't make me blow my whistle.
I'd just hate...
for you to blow...
your whistle.
no water sports after midnight.
that's hotel policy. - What's the policy on burning herb?
you can't try it until you buy it.
what's up?
it's all good.
believe me, it is all good.
crazy freak.
now where was I?
isn't this beautiful? - Damn.
there's ten people on this whole island.
they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi.
how's the water? - Crowded.
this feels great. - How's Julie doing?
she's up in her room alone.
any advice? - Yeah. Find another Jacuzzi.
don't give up so easy. Hang in there.
it's great, isn't it?
I can't win.
I can't.
where in the hell's my toothbrush?
it's happening again.
what happened?
I do not find this at all funny.
there was a body in there. I swear it.
you said you were tired. Maybe you were dreaming.
I wasn't dreaming. - I knew you people would be trouble.
I knew it the moment I saw you.
you listen to me. He's here.
who is here?
what's going on? - I don't know.
Julie saw some dead guy in the closet...
but all we see is bathrobes.
cool. - You think this is funny?
goddamn it, Tyrell. I am not going crazy. He was in there.
yeah? Then where is he now?
Where's the dead guy? - Julie, think about it.
what did you actually see?
I saw the dockhand guy hanging by his neck in there.
all right, look.
in the morning, we'll talk to Darick, the dockhand guy...
and we'll put this whole thing to rest.
in the meantime...
let's slow down on the Dark and Stormies and get some sleep.
don't look at me. - I want off this island.
that's not possible.
the last ferry left a couple hours ago. There won't be another one for days.
we have a storm coming. - I'll call the mainland for a boat.
the phones went down.
it's dead.
now listen up. The next couple days will be rough, but we'll make it.
what about a radio? - Emergencies only.
what the hell would you call this? - Four spoiled city kids...
who wouldn't know if a hurricane blew up their ass.
this is not a drill.
all we can do now is batten down and ride it out.
and if it gets really bad, we have a storm shelter.
good night.
pain of the past, tear of the future, blood of the young.
Yeah, that's my babies. Y'all growed up good.
y'all growed up real good.
where you hiding? Come to papa.
Yeah.
that's it.
find that damn lighter.
can I help you?
goddamn it!
what are you doing?
seriously, don't do that!
God, I... Jesus, no!
can I help you?
that's a full carat.
how much? - She's got some flaws.
truthfully, I don't have much of a market for this kind of thing.
best I can do is two, maybe two fifty. - Make it 300.
throw in that too.
which one are you talking about?
you're crazy, boy.
that's worth 300 all by itself.
and there's a waiting period. - I'm not waiting.
so keep the ring and give me the gun.
look, boy, you sure you want to go this way?
load it.
baby, this is bullshit.
this ain't the romantic weekend I had in mind.
get any sleep?
Yeah. Some. - Wow, look at that.
another beautiful day in paradise...
with Julie as our tour director.
miss Psychotic Episode.
you see any dead bodies out there?
any fresh kill?
shut up, Ty. - How about Freddie or Jason?
leave her alone.
I'm just saying what everybody's thinking.
it bad enough getting rained out, without having to hold her hand.
you don't have to be an asshole about it.
it's okay.
he doesn't believe me. That's his right.
I'm starting to think I'm crazy too.
nobody thinks you're crazy.
I do.
you guys go find something to do.
I want to do something with you. - Please?
let's go to the gym and work off some stress.
nobody thinks you're crazy.
look, what we need to do is find stoner boy.
make him hook us up with some Ping-Pong paddles or pool sticks.
you know what? The greenhouse effect has caused the Gulf Stream to shift.
meteorological experts expect dramatic increase in tropical depression...
which cause hurricanes and massive coastal flooding.
it wouldn't take much of a storm surge to wipe us off this island.
shut up, okay?
God.
come on!
this is a nice gym.
Yeah. - Wow. Nice move. - Yeah.
I'll give your fisherman some of this.
see how he likes it.
poor baby.
you know what? Got a better idea.
you're not leaving this island till you get a tan. Come on.
cancer in a box.
no, this is the safe sun.
come on. It's better than a day on the beach, girl.
here we go.
with a little photosynthesis, you will feel like a new...
house plant?
exactly. Bye.
you sure this is the way to the pool?
there's his cart. The idiot let it in the rain.
dryer.
gee, Karla, that will break the machine.
damn. How many pairs is in there?
pool boy!
yo, Bob Marley!
you in there or what?
you guys, help me! - We have to cut it!
use this!
come on.
I'm not crazy! I told you I was not crazy!
he's here. We better get to a radio and call for help.
this classifies as a fucking emergency.
brooks, where the fuck you at?
we want off this fucking island!
shit.
we gotta get the fuck out of here.
where are the boats? There were boats here.
they were cut loose.
you want to tell us what's going on? - We're all gonna die!
he's gonna kill us one by one. - Who?
stop that shit, all right? Ben Willis is dead.
you killed him. Remember? - They never found the body.
two summers ago, we lied to the authorities.
we hit Ben Willis with our car...
and threw his body in the water to cover it up.
only he didn't die.
he killed Barry and Helen last July 4.
I thought Ray and I had killed him, but we didn't.
you listen to me! He's back!
we're in the middle of nowhere!
there's dead bodies piling up all over the place!
as far as I can see, there's only one guy missing!
the porter. What's his name? - Estes. That's exactly who it is.
that fucker knows something.
we can sit here and wait for him to kill us or we can find him first.
it's not him. - Fuck that.
we got to do something. - I'm with him.
come on! - Julie, I can't believe you.
how can you not tell me the whole story?
I'm your best friend! - I didn't want to involve anybody else.
it's too late for that now.
let's go.
you sick bastard! You in here?
you hear me? Sick!
he's not here. - Some crazy shit in here.
Yeah, no doubt. This is our fucking killer.
this is our fucking guy.
you guys.
shit.
fuck.
anyone missing a hair tie? - Shit, that's my.
what about a toothbrush?
voodoo.
we got to find flashlights, torches, guns...
whatever they got on this island, so we can get off.
what if he's down there collecting body parts or something?
let's get the fuck out of here.
you guys should just wait here. - Why can't we come with you?
it's safer here. We'll just be one second.
where you going?
what the hell was that?
shit. Julie?
brasilia.
watch out!
that's the capital of Brazil, not Rio.
no, you guys. Leave him alone!
this is the killer. - Bullshit. We've seen the voodoo stuff.
I found the bodies this morning.
I tried to use the radio, but he had already destroyed it.
leave him alone. I believe him. - Come on. You saw his room.
I haven't hurt anyone.
I stole those things to help you, to protect you.
he could have easily killed me, but he didn't.
Jesus Christ, we didn't even answer the radio question right.
this whole thing was a setup. - What the fuck are you talking about?
rio isn't the capital of Brazil. Sorry, wrong answer.
we lose. - So then where is this Ben Willis?
I don't know.
you never fucking know.
are we supposed to just trust you?
how do we know you didn't set this up? - How do we know you didn't?
I know who you're talking about.
he used to work here at the hotel.
lately, I've seen him out in the woods by the orchard.
if you like, I can show you.
how do we know he's not setting us up?
where else are you gonna go? - I know I'm not staying here.
we'll be better off in the open.
if we stick together, maybe we can kill this asshole for good.
show us.
what the hell...
I need to get to Tower Bay Island.
we're closed.
I need to get to that island now.
let me ask you something, sport.
did you see what it's like outside?
I'm not looking for a weather report.
I'm looking for a boat.
so which one's yours?
he worked here for many years.
raised a family.
pretty wife, two little ones.
a boy and a girl.
one day the wife went missing.
maid found blood all over the honeymoon suite, room 201.
eventually, they found the body. Pieces of it, at least.
people say she was cheating on him.
people say he would beat her.
people say a lot of things.
he disappeared.
the children too.
now he's back.
Julie, be careful. - I've got to see.
what's today's date?
july 4.
I'm not gonna die on this island.
do you hear me?
if you want me, Ben, come and get me! I'm right here!
but my grave stays empty!
this is crazy.
the phone lines are down and the boats are gone...
this is the Arcadian requesting emergency assistance...
then we fight.
where did Estes go?
Why? He can't help us anyway. - He's probably the only one who can.
I'll find him. - I'm going with you.
are you crazy? You're gonna leave us here by ourselves?
it's okay. He couldn't have got far. I'll catch up with you later.
meet us back at the hotel, okay? - Damn it.
come on. Let's go.
Yes.
what I really need is a gun, not a knife.
so what's up?
what are you gonna do with those?
you gonna butter him? You gonna clean vegetables?
take this. You ready?
Yeah.
you okay?
we're gonna get this fucker, right?
let's head to the pantry. - Why? Is that a good place to hide?
I don't know. I'm just fuckin' hungry.
Estes, where did you go?
you said you would help us.
you should have told us you had a boat.
we're not going anywhere. - What?
baby, don't go in here.
it's only food. Don't even worry about it, baby.
stop trying to act like you ain't hungry.
shit!
it's just a stupid rat.
come in!
come on.
this is the Arcadian requesting emergency assistance...
for Tower Bay Island.
I repeat: This is the Arcadian requesting emergency assistance.
so, that's where the flashlights were.
look, I'm sorry, but you could have been the one doing all this.
so could you, crazy bitch.
you're the one that broke in to my hiding place.
I'm sorry. I must have missed the sign.
excuse me, but this place didn't have a murder rate until you showed up.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Yeah, get used to it.
who's doing this?
here we go. Look, don't even get her started.
it's a long fucked-up story...
and you probably won't believe a word of it anyway.
all I know is that this is the worse vacation of my whole lite.
I'm tired. I'm hungry. I'm fucking horny.
and, personally, I haven't seen one goddamn psycho killer.
I know where we can hide!
Karla, come on.
shit. - It won't lock.
follow me. Stay on the beams.
Jesus Christ, that's my bedroom.
give me your hand. Come on!
God, you sick freak.
shit.
shit! We've got to do something!
she is never gonna make it. Come on.
get off me!
Oh, shit.
damn, it's locked.
are you okay?
I'll live. It's locked.
we gotta open the door. - We'll get you out. I promise.
it's one of these. - Hurry.
shit! Come on, Nancy!
Nancy, open the door! Come on!
I can't find it!
get out of the way!
Karla, come on!
run!
where are we going? - The storm shelter!
don't worry. I know there's emergency power here somewhere.
I am holding your hand.
no, you're not.
you guys okay? - My God, it's Will.
come on. Let's get out of here.
everything's gonna be okay. Let's just get inside.
did you get help? What happened? - Estes attacked me.
what? You think he's a part of this? - I don't know.
you're hurt. - I'll be okay.
wait! I don't think we should go inside.
the last time I saw the slicker guy was on the beach.
I think we're safe.
Jesus, you're bleeding to death.
we need to find a first-aid kit. - I think there's one in the lobby.
okay, just sit there.
don't worry. He's gone. Just go. It will be okay.
I'll go with you. Come on.
listen, you are going to be okay.
Jesus, there's blood everywhere.
I can't find a wound. - It's because it's not my blood.
what?
it's not my blood, Julie.
what's your favorite radio station?
come on! What's your favorite radio station?
96. 7. It's time for you to contemplate the ultimate quickie getaway.
here. Take that.
come on.
fuck.
get off me! Get up!
God!
look at the bright side, Julie.
we finally get to spend some quality time together.
why are you doing this to me?
me, me, me. It's always about you.
I'm having bad dreams." "I can't sleep.
I'm not doing well in school." "I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
I trusted you.
you are so much like the rest of them.
you never take responsibility for anything you do...
and you think you can get away with murder.
why did you do that? You're a bitch.
that's gonna leave a mark.
tell me why. - Why? Think about it!
you'll get it. Will Benson!
Ben's son.
Hi, Dad.
hush now. No more screaming.
no more running. It's time to die.
let her go!
you gotta be shitting me.
what are you gonna do, boy? Call us names?
let her go now! - Think about it, boy.
you're no killer. That's my job.
you don't have it in you.
sure did miss you down here, Ray.
it's too bad. We could have been friends.
really, man, I would have shared her with you.
come on, stay with me. You see that?
think about all the things we are going to do to her.
you want him, Dad?
stand him up.
just fucking die.
this is the Coast Guard. Remain where you are.
the rescue team will be with you shortly.
God, I thought I would never see you again.
girl, you don't have to worry about me.
I'm made of steel.
good old Ray.
it anyone asks, let's not tell them it rained the whole time, okay?
it will be our little secret.
Yeah.
I almost fell asleep on the couch. You didn't tell me how late it was.
were you checking the locks again? - You know me too well.
don't you dare go to sleep.
I love this thing.
what the hell is your problem? Just stop.
I don't believe in heaven.
I believe in pain.
I believe in fear.
I believe in death.
there's an army of bodies under this river criminals, people who ran out of time, out of friends.
next time they drag this river, they'll find me on the bottom with the rest of them.
there won't be anyone left to say I was different.
I could feel the dead down in there...
just below my feet...
reaching up to welcome me as one of their own.
it was an easy mistake to make.
all the cold investigations in the city are collected up...
and delivered over here to us.
we call each of the witnesses to see if they have anything to add to their original statements.
and if they can? - We send the file to the original precinct for follow-up.
[Sighs] Don't get your hopes up though.
this is the Cold Case office.
once you've been through the file and come up empty, you bring it here.
Max here handles all our files.
it hits his desk, the case is officially dead.
so what if there's no phone number for a witness?
should I follow-up in person? - No, no. We don't do that kind of stuff down here.
I don't understand. Then how
how am I supposed to solve the unsolvable murder mystery and redeem yourself?
man, Internal Affairs - - Look, look, stop. All right, trust me.
there's a tragic story behind why I'm standin' here givin' you this tour.
we all did something, so just save it.
what do you say we grab a beer after work or something?
so what's his story? - There is none.
but back there you said - - Listen.
his wife and kid were murdered. They never found the guy.
that's his story.
remember when you were a kid and you'd hold your breath when you went past a graveyard?
just, uh, leave that man alone.
yo, homey, that's a really nice watch.
kinda reminds me of one I lost.
Oh, you didn't lose it. You pawned it up on 128th a few hours ago.
ask Doug. He was there with you.
are you followin' us, asshole?
no.
I'm only following you.
Aw, hell, no. What, you a cop or somethin'?
not tonight.
that's too bad. Now go get my watch.
come on, Dougie. Come get his watch.
I guess this ain't your lucky day, now, is it?
Whoa!
No! No! No!
watch over me. Watch over me.
watch over me. Watch over me.
watch over me. Watch over me. - Open your eyes. Now!
Oh, Jesus. - Have you ever seen this woman?
no. - You got busted robbing a house in New Jersey with William Preston six months ago.
bill's dead. - Why the hell do you think I'm talkin' to you?
did you ever hear anyone say anything about this woman? - Bill died
bill died 'cause their wings couldn't lift him up.
no, he got shot robbing a liquor store. What are you talking about?
their wings are gold, Max. They just look black. Feathers - - Get up!
all right. All right. - Hey, buddy.
man, I told you not to come here.
william Preston was a dead end.
I am done helping you, Max.
I paid my debt to society, you know?
I've cooperated enough, man.
okay?
what's goin' on in there?
what? It's a dinner party. Okay?
I'm a little offended I didn't get my invitation.
I didn't send out invita - Look, I told you. Go find Bill's partner.
I did. Dougie only wanted to talk about birds or something.
he was a whack job. Now I need a new name.
well, I'm outta ideas then! - Hey, baby.
okay. What - Not now, bitch! - Asshole!
look, okay? I told you. I don't know those kinds of people now.
I've moved up in the world, Max.
Yeah, I can see that. - Yeah. Th-Th-This is a dinner party.
all right? These are my friends. Do you remember friends?
listen. If you don't give me a new name...
I'm gonna start frisking every one of your friends.
three years on the street is a lifetime, man.
whoever you're lookin' for, there's no way they are still out there.
you're chasing ghosts, Max. God!
you try sleeping once in a while, you could see that for yourself.
I thought I knew all of Trevor's friends.
Max, Natasha. Natasha, Max.
Jesus Christ!
got a light? - I don't smoke.
that's interesting. - What?
your tattoo. That's interesting.
Oh, thank you.
I don't know him. Okay?
shit. - What?
stay back! What are you doing here?
you can't keep following me around. - Come with me.
Hey! - Mind your own business.
you have no right to be here!
yeah? - Uh-huh.
I'm clean. I'm not doing anything wrong.
da? - Da.
Hey! Why don't you relax?
it's a party. Have a drink.
just stop it. These are new friends.
I don't see the others anymore!
he's a cop.
how much trouble can I get in?
my sister. Sort of a bitch.
Hey, Max! Max. - What are you doing?
you have to go. Okay? Now.
I need to ask her something first.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
there you are.
Where'd you go?
take me somewhere. I'll tell you.
see you around, Lupino.
Hey.
easy.
you just move in?
so we're somewhere.
what was goin' on in that room back there?
Hey!
who was the guy with the tattoos on his face?
Mmm.
fine. What was her name?
what are you talkin' about? Who?
the girl from the boring story you want to tell me
the one that ends with you living here.
very sad.
I'll tell you what. Call me by her name.
like this you can make love to her just like she never left you.
Oh, Max. I miss you.
get out.
excuse me? - I said, get out now.
you're kicking me out of your bed?
Yeah. Get your shit and get out.
this is Owen. Leave a message.
Owen, it's Natasha.
Where's Lupino? I need some more stuff.
Yeah. Call me. Okay?
No!
no, not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
what? - Look. Jump in, will you?
where are we going? - I need you to look at something.
what about cameras? Security cameras anywhere?
there's got to be somebody who saw something.
time of death is?
we got body parts.
they're already canvassing. - What happened to them?
her. Just one.
I don't believe it.
what, are you two back together? Did you kiss and make up?
where are we on the weapon?
we're nowhere yet. I mean, looks like a blade...
but, uh, too much blood for that to be right.
Hey, O'Brien! Just a sec. Hey, listen.
why are you showing me this? - We found this here.
did you know her, Max?
it's Natasha.
let's take a ride.
folks, we need you to move back, please.
what are we doing here? - We're getting a beer, right?
you'd rather do this in the street?
fine. You were with the victim last night. Your wallet was found in the alley.
if you don't wanna talk to me, they're gonna send somebody who doesn't know you...
and won't care about your side of the story.
I didn't kill her. I don't need a side. - What's goin' on, Max?
what are you mixed up in, man? You can talk to me.
you know what they think about you at the force already, right?
you should hear all the questions I get about my old partner.
well, good thing you got my back then, huh? - What's that supposed to mean?
it means that with your follow-through on unsolved murders...
I don't have much hope for that girl in the alley.
is that what you think?
that I didn't work Michelle's case?
I did everything.
everything! - He's still out there somewhere.
one of them is still out there. That's everything.
all right?
we're done here.
come on! Max!
very good.
pleasure doing business with you.
detective Max Payne Is not available.
shit! - Please leave a message.
Max, it's me, Alex.
ms. Sax?
I'm sorry for your loss.
and we pulled her cell phone log.
uh, last call was to an... Owen Green.
called him twice.
Max, it's me, Alex.
you're not gonna believe this, but I think there's a connection between that girl in the alley and Michelle's murder.
I'm heading over to your apartment right now.
Alex, are you in here?
Alex?
Alex?
Alex?
the E. R. Doctor's old man was a patrolman in the 45th.
got you on a quiet floor.
BB? Where am I?
saint Mary's.
came in lookin' pretty bad, Max. What happened?
I don't
[Exhales] Alex.
when dispatch couldn't raise him...
they found out from Christa where he'd gone.
first unit got to you in time.
but Alex was
Alex was dead.
I got six shots off. I hit something- someone
you gotta check the hospitals. You gotta check for
I'm not a cop anymore, Max. I came to see about you.
he wanted to tell me something.
listen. Anything you can remember will help.
they got nothing for leads.
the whole force has you pegged as the prime suspect.
Yeah, you tell them where to find me.
wake starts in an hour.
I'll pass that along.
what do you think you're doing? - Paying my respects.
not like that, you aren't.
I should have a clean shirt for you at the office. It's on the way.
Mr. Hensley? There you go.
when did they move in here? - I guess we got the building last year.
we? - Sorry.
gets to be a habit.
mornin', Spike. - Good morning, Mr. Hensley.
you know the drill, sir. Sign in your guest, please.
Oh, my God.
Max.
ms. Horne.
how have you been?
fine, thanks.
I hope you know you can always call me.
please, Max, if there is ever anything we can do
I know. I've been meaning to. I got the cards. Thank you.
she was such a bright light in this company.
I'm not makin' any guarantees that any of this'll fit.
I saved one of those for you. Third page from the back.
they set up a scholarship in her name.
kept comin' to me for suggestions about what she might want.
I said art.
she liked art, right?
they knew we were close. Thought I was family.
it's a nice thing, a scholarship.
good way to remember somebody.
Hey, Joe.
Max, you remember Joe, right?
Hey. You here pickin' up some overtime?
I'd think twice about that. Hear the boss is a real asshole.
now that he's head of security, we're supposed to laugh at his jokes.
they still pay me like the janitor.
she's lookin' for you.
just tried me in my office too.
give me a second.
yeah?
Nicole?
relax. I'm the head of security.
Christa.
Jesus.
all it would have taken is one word from you...
to give Alex some peace.
are you happy now, Max?
you made him think he hadn't done enough.
what have you done, Max?
what has Max Payne done?
except for bring misery to everyone who ever cared for him.
now please get out of my house.
please, just go.
Ah, geez. Watch out for this prick.
detective Max Payne?
Jim Bravura, Internal Affairs. I need you to come with me.
now? - Yeah, now.
how'd the girl have your wallet?
she stole it.
what do you mean, "stole"? Like, picked your pocket?
how was it you knew each other?
we met through a friend.
Trevor Duncan.
he's your friend? - I guess.
that's classy.
you know what Trevor does for a livin', I assume.
he used to snitch for me.
Oh, used to.
tell me somethin', Max.
what's a glorified file clerk still need a snitch for, huh?
so you'd piss in a cup for us, right?
you just said the magic words. - Why don't you call when you hear from a union lawyer?
you and Detective Balder haven't worked together since your reassignment.
what made you get back in touch, huh?
he wanted to talk. - And?
Hey, asshole! I got two bodies in 10 body bags.
you were the last person to see either one.
Yeah, and some of that blood is mine. Good luck with your case.
nice work, Detective.
look, if you're really his friend, then talk to him.
well, let's hope that felt good.
makes you look guilty. You understand that, right?
it's not just Alex's unit that thinks you're the guy.
you need friends on the force right now.
there's only so much I can do from the outside.
where you goin'?
stupid son of a bitch.
Hey. I don't believe it.
just the guy. - You gotta be kiddin' me.
let's get the son of a bitch. - Where you think you're goin'?
unbelievable. - The detective in that office was killed.
get back here, asshole! Where do you think you're goin'?
there's no point runnin', Max! What are you gonna do in there?
back up. Back up. Make a hole!
back up, goddamn it! Make a hole!
he's a cop killer. - Open up, Max!
open up the goddamn door, Max!
open up! Don't make it hard! Open up!
goddamn it! Open up this fuckin' door!
open it! - Let's bust his face!
open the goddamn door! - You're only gonna make it worse!
come on, Max! Get your ass out here!
bust it down! - Open up!
now, Max! Now! Open the door!
get ya, Max!
son of a bitch!
Hey, Mike. Where is he?
Oh, for God's sake, Max. You're gonna freeze to death. Why don't you come inside?
Alex knew something about Michelle. Something new.
don't you think he would've told you if he had something?
he was trying to the night he was killed.
whatever was in the room - - What do you think you're looking for?
forget it. All right? - Max, talk to me!
Max?
now where you goin'?
...Max Payne.
drop your weapon.
just take it easy.
remove your backup piece with your left hand.
that's it. - Kneel down.
what? - Kneel the fuck down!
shit.
we need to talk about my sister.
look, my partner was killed too. We're both looking for the same person.
Yeah, you.
who's Owen Green?
how did you get that name? - Look, Natasha called
don't say her name! - I heard her call him. Okay?
Owen's probably the last person who saw her alive.
yeah? Except for the guy that left his wallet laying by her body.
does that sound like something a homicide cop gets wrong?
whoever killed your sister probably did the same thing to my partner and maybe my
look, you wanna help? Help me find Owen Green.
right here.
green is on the top floor.
you know what I do for a living. You try anything, and I'll kill you.
who is this guy?
some junkie my sister used to know.
Owen! Owen, open up!
Owen?
Owen?
Hey!
they're comin'.
Owen!
Hey, Owen.
they're coming.
Owen, look at me.
Owen, look at me.
I know Natasha called you. Do you know what happened to her?
she's gone.
they took her.
Owen?
Owen, just relax.
they took her up in their wings.
they took her.
Owen
Owen.
Jesus.
you know, it isn't anything new. People jump out of windows. They go crazy for no reason.
it just happens.
my Natasha got all her work done here.
I have to call you back, okay?
can I help you with somethin'?
Yeah.
if I wanted to get this tattoo
you in the marine corps? - This one.
what's it mean?
that's a Norse Valkyrie.
Vikings used to wear them for protection.
Valkyries fly over the battlefield picking out the righteous dead.
they reward the people who draw first blood.
a soldier's angel.
in Norse mythology...
the only way you get to go to heaven is to die in violence.
you die in your sleep, you go to hell.
protection from what? - Huh?
what do you mean, "huh"? You said people get the tattoo as protection.
what are they afraid of?
please!
please
come on! - Callate!
Callate!
Oh, God!
this is far enough.
I need to speak with Lincoln.
you expecting company there, Lincoln? - It's very dangerous right now.
I hear about your sister.
yeah? You know anything about it?
she will not be the last.
what about the tattoos?
huh? What do they mean?
the wings.
he marks them.
yeah? What does that mean?
the devil is building his army.
Yeah.
does this devil have a name?
many.
the one you are looking for is Lupino.
a place called Rag Na Rock.
it's an old club. East Side.
listen. Um, you still got an in with the cops, right?
see if they know anything about a Detective Max Payne.
Max Payne?
what?
Max Payne - he's been hunting.
three years of kicking down doors.
he is looking for something...
that God wants to stay hidden.
and that's what makes him even more dangerous.
Mona, stay away from Max Payne.
you don't want to be near him when Judgment Day comes.
they took her up in their wings.
their wings are golden. The feathers only look black.
that's a Norse Valkyrie.
a soldier's angel.
she was such a bright light in this company.
what is it? What's going on? - Coffee?
it isn't that I've been missing something.
it's that something is missing.
so? - BB, what do you mean, "so'"?
what would somebody want with her work papers?
I don't know.
who would then? Her old supervisor - What is his name?
Max, this has gone far enough! - That snotty-nosed, little preppy prick- What is his name?
Colvin. John Colvin. Is he still around?
hold on, Max.
BB, is he still working for the company?
Jason Colvin.
guy's name is Jason.
thank you.
this is Detective Bravura.
detective, I need to speak with you about Max right away.
please. It's urgent.
detective, thanks for seeing me at my office.
I need to explain what happened to Max.
a file can't tell you everything.
maybe you think that's all you need to know about Max.
can't tell you how beautiful Michelle was...
how happy they were together
can't tell you how the baby looked just like him.
it started out as a robbery.
the perps were losers, garbage. Had records, but nothing big.
that day, though, who knows?
guess they were out for something... more.
Michelle!
Michelle! Michelle!
Michelle!
it's okay. The angels burn within them now.
he was maybe 10 minutes too late.
that's all. Ten minutes.
we looked everywhere for the third guy. But there was nothin' to go on.
Max...
transferred to Cold Case, working leads that went nowhere.
he was... never the same.
of course not.
understand. This is my old partner's kid.
he's family. You gotta help him here.
you should hear the kind of things Max is saying.
none of it makes any sense.
he's gotten in his head that someone here at the company is responsible.
I'm worried he's gonna... get into another situation before I can convince him to come in.
so you really think he's -- I think you need to find him.
what is it, Jason?
I, uh
is this a threat?
No! No, l
I just thought you should be aware.
just take care of it, Jason.
you'll have the opportunity to come in and talk to
there's someone in your office.
it's a detective.
this your daughter?
Yes, it is. Three years old.
she's beautiful.
is there something I can help you with, Detective?
I don't know yet.
maybe if you told me what this was about.
it's a homicide- multiple homicides.
I didn't get your name.
Max Payne.
sorry I didn't recognize you.
that's okay.
what can you tell me about what Michelle was working on right before she died?
I don't know, routine projects. Um
nothin' really out of the ordinary.
look, it's really hard to be specific that... long ago.
um -- Well, can't you look it up?
I don't know how I would, really.
you know th-that far back, uh, any documents we had
would be gone, and
I'm not- I'm not sure of any other way.
so there's just no trace of her?
well, it's nothing personal. We just, uh
can't keep- Save everything and, uh
you need to make a call? - Maybe I should.
Yeah. Beautiful office you have here.
Jackie, hi. Uh, Detective
what do you know? - Wait.
I need to talk to somebody about a woman that used to work here. - You can have a seat over there.
uh, Mr. Colvin?
you're lying to me! Why? - I'm not!
Mr. Colvin?
tell me what happened to Michelle. - I don't know.
Mr. Colvin, are you okay?
Jackie! - Mr. Colvin, it's Jackie! I can hear you!
are you all right?
what was she working on? - I don't know!
I was in charge of a different project. It was a government contract.
what did it have to do with Michelle?
nothing! She was just
security.
can I speak to BB, please?
yeah? - BB, help! It's Jackie. Jason's in trouble.
what? - Should I call your guys?
no, no, no. I'll call. - Hurry, please.
Oh, shit. Okay.
it was a military operation.
it was something to make... soldiers more aggressive in combat.
it was a disaster. It only worked on one percent. Made them invincible.
all right? The rest suffered horrible hallucinations- devils, demons.
it drove them insane.
I mean, the effects were uncontrollable.
and the stuff was so addictive, we couldn't even guarantee the safety of our own scientists.
and we had to shut it down. The test subjects, they'd follow 'em home.
they'd kill 'em, just for an extra dose.
is that what happened to Michelle? - No.
let's go! Move! Move!
what do you mean, no? What happened to her then? - Please! Jesus!
please! Look. She didn't even know what was coming for her.
Mr. Colvin, I called security, and they're on their way!
I will tell you what happened. You gotta get me outta here though. Right now.
what are you talking about? - I will confess to everything, but you gotta get me outta here!
that's not good enough! You tell me what happened to her right now!
she was killed because of the drugs! The envelope.
bring it with us. Everything. It's all in there.
please. You've gotta protect me from them.
who are you talking about?
the man who killed your wife!
get the envelope. Get it!
let's go.
calm down!
relax! N. Y. P. D!
central Dispatch. - This is Jim Bravura. I. A.
what unit is responding to the Aesir call?
the Aesir building! You mean nobody's called anything in yet?
would you like to report an incident? - Hell, yes, I'd like to report somethin'!
we have machine gun fire in Midtown!
fire!
God damn it!
get down!
move! Move! Move! Move!
hold fire! Hold fire!
knock down that door! - Put your hands up!
you need to come in now! - Not a chance!
come on! - Is this about your wife?
colvin knew. - Take it easy, Max.
just come in and we'll talk about this right now. All right?
clear!
move!
where is he? - I can't see!
got anything?
no, he's gone!
great job, boys! See what you did? You let 'im get away.
let me see your hands! - Relax, motherfucker! N. Y. P. D.
what the fuck is goin' on up there? - Yeah. Good job!
everybody gonna get a medal for this. Great! Damn!
I'm at the office. I'll call you back.
... and will forever give them the combat edge in conflicts of the future.
Valkyr - 100% effective. 100% combat tested.
the new weapon in the war on terror.
valkyr, the strength of freedom.
valkyr, winning the war on terror. - You need to see this.
from the dawn of time...
great generals have always known the one fundamental truth of warfare.
morale wins battles.
thanks to the breakthroughs made by Aesir Pharmaceuticals...
the military of tomorrow will be able to unlock the limitless potential inside every soldier.
introducing Valkyr. The strength of freedom.
that's what this is about? A drug?
how has your experience of combat improved since taking the drug Valkyr?
well, I'm never scared, for starters.
describe to me, if you will, how is Valkyr winning the war on terror?
you face down a group of insurgents...
and instead of fear, you're filled with, um, peace, I guess.
it's like something's watching over you from above.
you feel like you have wings.
so wouldn't you say you feel stronger, more secure, more capable?
Oh, definitely. It's just whatever it takes to win the war out there.
I feel indestructible. Nothing can stop me.
I can face anything.
have you noticed any side effects?
I can only speak for myself, and, um, no.
I apologize. You wanna do it again? - No, we're good.
that's enough. Turn it off.
killed my wife.
Natasha too.
he's in an old club called Rag Na Rock.
you know where it is? - Yeah.
forget it, Max. You go there, you die.
you have my help with anything else, but not to go in there.
Yeah, you keep it then.
you don't wanna make it out alive.
you think that if he puts you out of your misery, you'll be with them again.
Yeah, I hope that's how it works.
copy that. You need help up front?
unit Six, Lupino is secure.
Ow!
you hear them coming.
we'll see which one of us they're flying for.
we'll see which one of us they love best.
God, you're so blessed.
the angels-The angels are not done with you yet!
BB?
what's goin' on here, BB?
let's go.
let's get outta here.
BB - BB, what's goin' on here?
BB, I looked at Lupino, he didn't know who I was. What are you doin' here?
now? - No, not yet!
cuff him.
what was I supposed to do? Michelle kept nosin' around.
some boxes from a dead project went missing.
she mentioned it to me without knowing what it really meant.
I had to - I had to talk to her.
show her my side before she took it to someone else.
before that night...
the things that went wrong for me seemed impossible to do anything about.
Michelle was the first problem in my life small enough to reach out and stop.
once that happened, though, once I realized I could use the strength of my hands...
to keep one thing from being taken away from me
well, by the time Michelle stopped screaming that night...
I'd learned the most amazing lesson.
I could've been doing this my entire life.
I was a new person that night.
all the other things that I'd ever let go.
the-the times I'd accepted my own... weakness...
I could've just reached out my hands and stopped it.
and from there, figuring out how to put the drug on the street...
how to make use of Lupino and the rest of them, well, that was easy.
but only because of Michelle
the first problem I really solved for myself.
the second... was the baby.
okay, enough. Enough of this shit.
BB!
Joe, why don't you calm the fuck down?
it's not like we didn't see it comin'.
sullen, withdrawn.
Max just never seemed the same after the tragedy.
grab me some of that rope.
it's a good thing his father didn't live to see it though.
the great Bill Payne's only son.
a strung-out junkie suicide.
it would have eaten him alive
get him, Joe!
screw him. He'll freeze to death.
come on.
not yet, Max.
Bravura! What the hell is goin' on?
why is half my force here instead of out on the street? Under what authority do you
I am investigating the shooting of an unarmed civilian, Jason Colvin.
and the attempted murder of Detective Max Payne.
Really? Well, I heard he took the first shot.
if I know the men I serve with, I don't think that they're gonna contradict that.
Yeah, and what kinda men would that be? - These are real cops.
Oh. - No offense.
none taken. Agent Taliente, I'd like you to meet a real cop.
detective. Jack Taliente, Special Agent, F. B. I. Who are you?
bravura called in the F. B. I.
they're on their way.
for God sakes, come on! Max is dead! They got nothin' else!
come on!
get 'em in! Get 'em in! - Car's waiting! Let's go!
hit the button! P1!
calm down, Joe.
this is Air One proceeding northbound 3-5-0-500.
E. T. A. Three miles. Give me a frequency to push to.
P. D. Air One, please return my frequency. 126-105.
copy that, Dispatch. We're inbound.
your car's waiting, sir.
Oh, shit.
he's not dead. He's here. - Bullshit.
let's move it! Move! Move! - Go!
get him, Joe!
where the hell is he?
where the hell you going, Joe?
P. D. Air One, say your last. - We need more information.
do you got Bravura on the line for us? We need- We need more information on this situation.
who you callin'?
it's late.
I need you to send a helicopter to the roof. - What are you talking about, BB?
the Michelle Payne thing's coming back on us!
air One, this is Lieutenant Jim Bravura.
federal agents and uniforms are inbound at this time.
take some C-4.
wire it so he can't make it to the roof. - Are you nuts?
you saw him.
you saw him, Joe. He isn't gonna stop.
No!
okay, we got multiple shots fired. We need back-up ASAP.
copy that, P. D. Air One.
Michelle? - Max.
Max?
Max! Max, come on.
listen, I will hold them off for as long as I can, but you have to finish this.
Max, come on.
come on. Come on. Take it.
take it!
Max, come on. Look at me.
you're not done yet.
come on. Come on, pick up! Where are you? Come on!
be careful with that thing.
come on now, Mona.
I'm sure we can work something out.
BB!
detective Max Payne is in the line of fire. Snipers, do not take the shot.
Bravura! - You take Payne alive if there's anything left.
calm down, BB.
holy shit! Breaker, this is Air One.
run!
go! Go!
laguardia Tower, this is P. D. Air One.
we have a major explosion at the Aesir building.
Bravura! You all right?
get everybody upstairs! Now! - Guys, that's our cue.
division One, upstairs! Right now! On the double! Let's go!
where are you?
it's unbelievable, all that snow.
and watch it end up being a beautiful day.
you want my confession first?
I don't know about heaven.
but I do believe in angels.
Yeah. It's Daddy.
Hey, buddy. - Is that your daddy?
not yet, Max.
we have him. Max Payne is alive. He's okay. We got him.
it's good to have you back.
Hey.
attention. Please prepare for docking procedure.
there's a package for you, Miss Perkins.
they didn't leave a name.
said it was important. Thank you.
I don't like this business you're getting yourself into.
I'll be just fine, Mr. Paley. You know what a careful girl I am.
I move my mouth, words come out, you don't hear.
I'm late for a movie. I don't like it when you smile at me.
you don't like my smile?
I don't like what's behind it.
listen, Polly, six scientists are missing, probably dead.
somebody out there means business. I don't want you in the middle of it.
it's only a movie, Mr. Paley.
I'll bring you some popcorn.
toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
we must be over the rainbow.
you sent me this?
who are you?
what's this all about, Mr. Doctor.
Dr. Walter Jennings. I'm a research chemist.
I specialize in nucleicacid emissions.
the bonding enzymes in proteus molecules which...
the missing scientists. You said you knew who was next.
Yes, l...
I have a deadline to meet, doctor.
I was one of seven scientists chosen to serve in a secret facility stationed outside of Berlin before the start of the First World War.
it was known only as Einheit Elf, "Unit 11."
we agreed never to discuss what went on behind those doors.
the things we were made to do there...
terrible things.
I shouldn't have come. Now I know we're not in Kansas.
are you a good witch or a bad witch?
doctor, you said you knew who was next.
Yes.
don't you see?
there is only one left. Who? Who is it, doctor?
me.
he's coming for me.
who? Who's coming?
Totenkopf.
it's Totenkopf.
there!
all citizens, attention.
new York City must be evacuated at once.
proceed in an orderly manner to the East River Drive.
all members of the police and fire department on leave or off duty shall report immediately to their precincts or company command.
this is urgent.
editor Paley. Mr. Paley, it's me, Polly.
what's going on? They're calling for midtown to evacuate.
listen, Mr. Paley, I don't have much time.
I need you to dig up anything you can on a Dr. Walter Jennings and someone named Totenkopf. An address, a phone number, anything you can find. It's important.
Totenkopf. Who is he?
he may have something to do with the missing scientists.
quick as you can.
Polly, listen to me. I want you to get out of there.
I want you to put the phone down, close your notepad and get the hell out of there.
wait a minute.
I can see something now coming into sight above the Palisades.
they're crossing Sixth Avenue.
fifth Avenue.
they're a hundred... They're a hundred yards away.
Polly. Polly!
Oh, my God.
Polly!
Polly!
Polly!
stop! Come back!
fire!
get out of here!
they've broken through the perimeter. Send reinforcements.
send everything you've got!
emergency protocol 90206. Calling Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.
repeat. Calling Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.
this is an emergency protocol, 90206.
calling Sky Captain. Sky Captain, do you read?
calling Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.
this is an emergency protocol, 90206.
calling Sky Captain. Sky Captain, do you read?
repeat. Calling Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.
this is Sky Captain. I'm on my way.
Polly.
Joe.
further details of the attack continue to pour in.
the central portion of the city is blacked out from radio communication due to damaged power lines and electrical failure.
cables received from English, French and German news agencies now confirm the attack was not limited to the city.
the BBC is reporting that a steel mill in Nuremberg was virtually excavated by what witnesses describe as a mechanized tornado.
news agencies in Paris and Madrid speak of strange burrowing machines rising from the ground, robbing entire communities of their coal and oil reserves.
meanwhile, with military resources stretched thin across the globe, world leaders must once again call upon the elite mercenary forces of Sky Captain and his army for hire to uncover the meaning of these mysterious events.
Where's Dex?
shazam.
I thought you said this thing was big. Can I have it?
you find out where it came from, and I'll buy you one for Christmas.
Oh, I need to show you something.
I recorded this signal just before the first machine appeared.
I didn't think anything of it until I played it back.
Morse code? See, that's what I thought at first, but the syntax is more complex than that.
there's a subcarrier hidden in the lower frequency.
I think it's being used to control them.
if it shows up again, could you track it?
I can try, yeah.
good boy, Dex. Thanks.
in the meantime, see what you can do with that thing.
find out what makes it tick.
you don't mind, do you? I don't mind.
I wanna know where it comes from, Dex. Who sent it here.
switch to map coordinate 69 SW by 49 E.
tummy ache?
how you been, Joe?
miss me? Get out.
well, it's nice to see you too.
Dex said you might be in a mood.
Dex?
get in here!
it's been three years, Joe. You're not still mad at me, are you?
can't even remember what we were fighting about.
you sabotaged my plane.
right.
I spent six months in a Manchurian slave camp because of you.
they were gonna cut off my fingers. Joe, for the last time, I didn't sabotage your damn airplane.
all so you could get a photograph of Tojo Hideki in his bathrobe, remember?
you know, I'm starting to think that you've invented this whole sabotage nonsense to cover the fact that you were running around on me with your little mystery girl the whole time we were in Nanjing.
never happened. All in your imagination.
who was she, Joe?
what was her name? That's enough.
what are you gonna do?
shoot me?
it's been a pleasure, Polly.
let's do it again in ten years. Escort Miss Perkins off the base, Dex.
if she resists, shoot her.
Hi, Polly. Hi, Dex.
I gotta... It's okay, hon, I know.
okay.
it's just as well. I guess you wouldn't have been interested in this, anyway.
where did you get that? There's more where this came from.
lots more.
I want that blueprint, Polly. I want this story, Joe.
and you're gonna help me get it.
maybe we should show her, Cap. Maybe she can help.
show me what?
show me what?
my God. What is this?
where do they come from?
they started appearing three years ago in remote areas.
we managed to keep it a secret until now.
they show up without warning, they take what they need, and then they disappear without a trace.
three years and we still can't explain what they want or who's sending them here.
a man came to see me today, a scientist.
he was terrified. Said someone was coming for him.
I asked him who he was so afraid of, and he repeated one name:
Totenkopf.
he nearly went white when he said it.
Totenkopf, who is he?
he's the invisible man.
I've been through every library record twice looking for anything.
I've called every contact I have from Paris to Bangkok.
this is the only thing I could dig up.
he ran some kind of secret science unit outside of Berlin before the start of World War I.
something called Unit 11.
it's been more than 30 years since anyone has spoken his name.
until today.
note the insignia he used for the unit.
it matches the markings on all of these machines.
the scientist, where is he now?
we're in this together, right, Joe?
nothing gets published until I say so. You don't write a sentence or take a photograph without asking me first. Understood?
understood.
what?
I missed you.
thanks for saving my life today, by the way.
were you down there?
you missed me too. How nice.
this is it. This is Jennings' lab.
Dr. Jennings? It's Polly Perkins.
Dr. Jennings!
it's locked.
that window there.
I may be able to get in through that window if I can attach a line...
it's open.
we're too late. Someone beat us here.
all right, Polly...
...no more games. What the hell is going on?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Dr. Jennings!
you must stop him!
stay here.
stop!
I don't wanna hurt you.
miss Perkins. I'm here, doctor.
I'm going to get you some help. You must promise.
if Totenkopf finds them, the countdown will begin.
this world shall end. I don't understand, doctor. Find what?
promise.
he's dead.
I think I found something.
Dr. Jennings had this with him this morning at the theater.
I'd better get back to the base. I'm coming with you.
of course you are.
reconnaissance picked up something on radar traveling at over 500 knots and coming straight for us.
how long before they reach us? There!
get my plane ready. I'm going up.
what are you doing? I'm coming with you.
don't be stupid. Remember what happened last time you flew with me?
we had a deal. This is not a game, Polly.
people are gonna die. You are not leaving me, Joe.
not this time. This is my story, and we had a deal!
go, go, go!
get in.
there you are.
cap, this is Dex, do you read me? Hang on, Dex, I'm a little busy.
come in, Dex.
look, whatever you do, don't shoot!
okay. You shot it, didn't you?
Yes. Listen, Cap, the signal's coming from one of those machines.
you gotta keep them in one piece.
which machine is it, Dex?
there's no way of telling. It could be any one of them.
I think I found it, Dex.
wait, Cap, I'm losing the signal. It's heading for the city.
don't let it get away. I need you to bounce that signal back to me.
if we lose it now, we may never get it back.
you let me know when you've got something, Dex.
I'll let you know. Out.
all right, I want a fullspectrum sweep of every incoming signal.
amplify any variant frequency cycle and route them to me.
they've come back for the generators.
who is this guy?
you okay? Great.
there's a bottle of Milk of Magnesia under the seat if you need it.
I'm fine. You don't look so good.
pull up!
Joe! I see it!
it's getting away.
I lost the signal, Cap. I'll find him, Dex. Sit tight.
go left. Sit back, Polly.
there's a shortcut down Broadway. You can catch him on 42nd Street.
I know these streets like the back of my hand. Go left!
Hey!
okay, okay, now go straight.
no, no, no, go right! When?
back there.
I could use a little more warning next time.
go left!
tell me you got something, Dex.
we're getting clobbered up here.
it's no picnic down here either, Cap. Hang in there, I've almost got it.
Joe!
Dex! We can't hold them off any longer!
I'm almost there. We have to evacuate now!
go ahead without me. I'm right behind you.
lovely. Okay, turn left at the drugstore.
left again. We're going around in circles.
will you just trust me? Go left!
it's a dead end. That's not supposed to be there.
it's a dead end!
there's no way out!
Oh, bugger.
Joe!
there's the lead ship. Shortcut!
I got us here, didn't I?
Dex. Dex! Thirty seconds, Cap, that's all I need.
thirty seconds. Plus or minus.
listen, I'll try and take them out over the water, buy us some time. Over.
still glad you came?
Joe, I found it! Joe!
Dex, come in. Where is it?
come in, Dex. Are you there? Dex?
Dex, do you read me?
Dex, are you there?
I can't out run them much longer.
hold on.
Joe, what are you doing? You're heading straight down!
you're gonna kill us! I know what I'm doing. Just hold on.
we're going too fast. We're not gonna make it.
Joe, you have to pull up!
pull up!
we went underwater. Dex rigged it up.
got the idea from one of his comic books.
you mean, you knew this the whole time, and you let me think we were gonna crash?
I thought we were gonna die! You should have said something!
look, Polly, it was your idea to tag along, not mine.
if you can't take it, that's not my fault.
Oh, I can take it.
I can take anything you dish out. Good.
because that was nothing.
Dex, come in. Do you read me?
do you read me, Dex? Copy.
Dex!
Dex!
Dex.
they're everywhere.
Joe, look out!
Dex!
why would Totenkopf do this?
why Dex? It doesn't make any sense.
he was looking for something.
Dex said he knew where the transmission was coming from.
he must have got too close.
he was trying to tell me something... Joe.
good boy, Dex.
these journals belong to Dr. Vargas.
he must have passed them on to Dr. Jennings before his disappearance.
my God. What?
Totenkopf was awarded his first patent when he was 12 years old.
by 17, he had already received two doctorates and was one of the most highly regarded minds of his day.
one year after his disappearance, ominous rumors began circulating.
whispers that Totenkopf had begun work on what was darkly hinted to be a doomsday device.
efforts to locate him have consistently failed, and to this day, his whereabouts remain a mystery.
even less is known about his companion, an assassin who controls his machines.
she's the one who took Dex.
what else?
these are Unit 11 supply logs.
this is everything he's used his machines to collect for the last three years, including generators from the city.
it reads like a shopping list from all over the world.
what have you been up to, doctor?
it'll be all right, Joe. Dex can look after himself.
we'll find him.
my old friend Joe.
so glad to see you again. It's good to see you too, Kaji.
so glad to see you again. It's good to see you too, Kaji.
this is Polly Perkins. She'll be coming with us.
nice to meet you.
Kaji, did you get the maps I needed? Yeah, they're inside.
did you get a little something for me?
of course. Three cases, just like you asked.
Vienna sausages. My God, it's been so long.
Kaji, how's your Tibetan?
come, I'll show you the maps.
how well do you know him? Kaji?
he's old legion. Reconnaissance. Why?
I don't trust him.
that's funny, he said the same thing about you.
here. Get changed. Your clothes stay behind.
you won't be needing high heels where we're going.
Dex tracked the signal to here, this valley north of Karakal.
this is where the transmission originated.
why is there no writing here? What is this place?
Shambhala. You know it?
it is forbidden.
it's said to be the source of the Kalachakra, Tibetan magic.
those who live there are said to have supernatural powers.
you can get us there, Kaji, can't you?
no one has ventured this far. It's very dangerous.
Shambhala is said to be protected by the priests of the Kalachakra lamasery.
if they find us there, they will kill us.
Why? Why is this place so special?
Shambhala is known by many names. To the Hebrew, it is Eden.
to the ancient Greek, it was Empurios.
you may know it as Shangrila.
a storm is coming. If you still wish to go, we must go now.
I need to send a message.
editor Paley, this may be the last message you receive from me.
we've tracked a radio signal to Nepal in search of Dr. Totenkopf.
the story grows stranger at every turn.
clues about a countdown. But to what, I don't know.
I fear time is running out.
with any luck, I'll be back soon with Dex and the story.
I hope. Polly Perkins.
this is where civilization stops.
a blank on the map.
we must be careful from here.
hurry.
what is it?
it looks like a mining outpost.
something bad happened here.
seems to be abandoned.
tell your men we're heading down.
I want a closer look.
what is it, Joe?
uranium.
the whole mine's contaminated.
we can't stay here. Let's go.
Where's Polly?
Polly!
miss Perkins?
we'll have to split up.
Polly!
let her go.
give me the vials and the girl will live.
what vials? What are you talking about?
I will not ask a second time.
drop the gun.
I told you, I don't know what you're talking about. You'll just have to kill us.
as you wish.
wait! Wait. Wait.
I'm sorry, Joe.
goodbye, my friends. Your journey ends here.
I was going to tell you, Joe. You have to believe me.
what was in those vials? I don't know.
you expect me to believe that? I'm telling the truth, Joe.
Dr. Jennings gave them to me just before he died.
he said that the world would end and the countdown would begin if Totenkopf got his hands on them.
you've done nothing but lie to me from the beginning.
okay, I'm a liar. But I don't exaggerate. That is what he said.
that was what Totenkopf was looking for.
that's why he took Dex. I'm sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
do you hear that?
dynamite.
that noise again.
move!
what are you doing?
come on!
Oh, great.
we're safe.
Polly, this may be our last moment together.
there's something I need to ask you.
Yes, Joe?
did you cut my fuel line?
damn it! I didn't sabotage your lousy airplane!
our last moments on earth and this is all you have to say to me?
could we just for once die without all this bickering?
there you are.
why did you lock the door? Run!
my film.
Polly, leave it! There's no time!
Polly.
Polly.
my clothes.
what are you doing in here? Get out. Get out!
not unless you have some pants hidden under there for me.
Oh, don't tell me you're... Naked.
you can say it, Polly. This isn't funny, Joe.
where are we? What happened to us? Where are our clothes?
stop looking at me like that.
like what?
turn around, Joe.
I'm serious. Turn around.
Hi, Joe.
ask him what he did with our clothes.
the clothes are burned.
burned? Why?
he says the mine is poisonous.
our clothes were infected.
he says he's arranged for a guide to lead us back down the mountain.
he will take us there once we are dressed.
we appreciate that. But explain to him we are here to find a man.
he says we must leave before it is dark.
there's nothing more he can do for us.
it's very important we find this man.
his name is Totenkopf!
he says, what do you want with this man?
I've come to kill him.
and to find my friend.
he says he will help you.
what do you think?
I think they burned the wrong clothes.
you said I couldn't bring anything else.
I think you look like a woolly mammoth.
they're waiting for us.
the priest says that Totenkopf enslaved his people, made them work in the mine, but the mine was poisonous.
those who did not die right away were brought here for him to study.
where is Totenkopf now?
he does not know. Only that Totenkopf is gone, many years ago.
I can't believe this is happening.
I only have two shots left.
we're in Shangrila and all I have is two shots.
everything I had was in that bag.
you should have let me go back for my film.
you're right, I should have.
so where's he taking us?
to meet the only living survivor of Totenkopf's experiments.
what experiments?
ask him, where is Totenkopf? Tell him it's important we find him.
he wants to know why. Why do you seek Totenkopf?
to make him pay for what he has done.
his staff. He's asking for his staff.
he says, follow Rana. The staff will lead you there to Totenkopf.
Rana? Is there such a place?
he says now that he has helped you, you must help him.
of course. Anything.
what do you want?
kill me.
have you looked at this? There's markings on it, like a ruler.
and there's a moon and a star.
and all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by
a star.
he wasn't talking about a place, he was talking about a star!
rana is a star.
ancient sailors used to navigate by using the night sky.
they could determine their position by the moon and the stars.
the Vikings were known to create maps for certain stars,
the Vikings were known to create maps for certain stars, latitude tables that required a key to decipher them.
the key was called Jacob's staff. This has to be the key!
you mean this could really work?
you could really find Totenkopf with this thing?
we do things a little different nowadays.
all we needed to know was where to look. What's the date?
march 2. March 2.
using Karakal Plateau as our assumed position...
march 2...
rana is at latitude 20. 40.
right ascension, 03 hours, 43 minutes.
Declination, minus 10. 60.
there's nothing there.
are you sure you did it right?
I'm sure.
if the old man was right, that's where Totenkopf is now.
dead center in the middle of nowhere.
what's that point there?
that's where we run out of fuel.
Oh, great.
so how do we get there?
Franky. Who?
Frank Cook. An old buddy of mine.
runs a mobile reconnaissance outpost for the Royal Navy.
if I can get a message to them,
I may be able to arrange a rendezvous at these coordinates.
and what if they don't get the message?
franky's never let me down. They'll be there.
they'll be there.
is that light supposed to be on?
relax, Polly, everything's fine.
we're out of fuel, aren't we? Buckle up.
manta Station, do you read me?
where are you, Franky?
what are you doing?
you can't land this in the middle of nowhere.
I'm not. I'm landing it on that.
what is it? It's a mobile airstrip.
Dex had a hand in designing it.
it's kind of a secret. You can keep a secret, can't you, Polly?
Yeah.
I can keep a secret.
two shots.
permission to land on platform 327. Maintain your present course.
copy, 327.
welcome aboard, captain.
joseph Sullivan. I was sure you'd be dead by now.
it's good to see you too, Franky.
this had better be important or one of us is in trouble.
it's important.
what is that?
you be nice.
commander Cook, meet Polly Perkins.
Polly Perkins. I've heard so much about you.
it's a pleasure to finally meet the competition.
it's been a long time since Nanjing, hasn't it, Joseph?
so, Franky, I hear you've been having trouble with that number three engine, or at least you were last time...
commander, we're tracking six enemy submersibles bearing 30 degrees northwest.
who wants to kill you now? Man your battle stations.
all hands on deck. Follow me.
take us to 10, 000 feet and deploy countermeasures.
Yes, commander.
reconnaissance located an island 3 kilometers northeast of our current position.
it is not, however, on any of our charts.
that has to be him. That has to be who?
what have you got me into this time, Joseph?
nothing you can't handle, Franky.
Polly, try not to touch anything.
enemy warships bearing 316, mark 4. Closing fast.
give me a visual. Launching radio imager.
we're receiving a signal. On screen now.
Totenkopf.
commander, we've lost power to the forward rotors. We're losing altitude.
all engines, reverse full. Get us out of here.
francesca, you've got to get me on that island.
I'm not about to risk the lives of my men for one of your silly antics.
he's got Dex.
rescind order!
you'll never make it from the air. We have to find you another way.
there's a tidal flow on the eastern face of the island.
it's too deep. We're not rated past 300 meters.
but...
...this area here, there's an undersea inlet at the southern tip and it runs beneath the entire length of the island. That is your only way in.
everything else is sheer rock to the edge of the water.
what about those machines? How do we get past them?
leave that to me.
alert the amphibious squadron.
report to main station carrier.
what?
Nanjing?
I can't hear you, Polly.
you'll have to speak up.
keep your nose up, Joseph. You always were bad at the short takeoff.
keep up, Franky. I don't wanna have to come back for you.
I thought your takeoff was just fine.
thank you, Polly.
so you heard that, did you?
manta leader to Manta team, impact in ten seconds.
switching to amphibious mode.
impact in five, four, three,
Franky.
you remember our milk run over Shanghai, don't you?
we had the target buttoned up and he was jinxing in the flak.
pops a rivet, thinks he's taken a hit. And started yelling:
protect the rabbits! Protect the rabbits!
protect the rabbits! Protect the rabbits!
enemy target spotted four points to the right. Depth, 1, 600. Look sharp.
Joe, watch out!
Joseph, there's the inlet. I see it.
get ready to make a run for it. We're about to clear you a path.
hold on, now, Polly. Hold on.
manta leader to Manta team, arm cluster torpedoes and stick close to element formation.
fire.
Joseph! Pull up!
Joseph, it's still alive. Disengage.
do you hear me? Disengage.
do you hear me?
what is it? Do you hear me? Pull up!
the rudder's jammed. I can't steer. Joseph!
Disengage!
thank you, Franky. That was close. Get ready to make a run for it.
you're only going to have one shot at this.
Franky, what are you doing? This is no time to show off.
she's heading straight for it. On my mark.
she's going to ram it. It's suicide.
Franky, pull up.
three. Pull up, Franky.
you're all clear.
good luck, Joe.
thank you, Franky. We'll take it from here.
she's some kind of girl.
Yes, I know.
I'm taking us up.
what?
what is it? One of Totenkopf's creatures.
you're not gonna photograph that? I've only got two shots left.
who knows what's waiting for us out there.
suit yourself.
there's a clearing up ahead. Totenkopf can't be far.
run.
there.
Polly!
Oh, great.
come on!
Polly!
come on!
are you mad?
are you mad?
are you completely insane? You could have gotten yourself killed!
it's okay. No, it isn't.
I didn't mean... I shot the ground!
what? When we were running,
I shot the ground.
it isn't funny.
I only have one shot left. One shot!
what is it with you and that stupid camera, anyway?
you gave it to me.
you don't even remember, do you?
you were flying with the American volunteers in Nanjing,
I was covering the evacuation of Shanghai.
I remember. Joe, I wanna ask you something and I want you to tell me the truth.
I don't care one way or the other, I swear. I just need to know.
the girl in Nanjing was Franky, wasn't it?
Polly. How long were you seeing her?
look me in the eyes.
I never fooled around on you.
never.
I sabotaged your plane.
three months. I knew it!
I can't believe I ever trusted you, you lousy...
he's here.
you all right?
through there.
through there.
my God, Joe.
it's an ark.
he's building an ark.
what are you doing?
you honestly think you're gonna find something more important than every single creature on Earth being led two by two inside a giant rocket ship?
I might.
like what? I'll know when I see it.
ten minutes to liftoff. They've started the countdown.
we have to find Totenkopf.
you've got a gift.
Dex! Hurry, get in!
Einsteigen. Komm, springt!
are you all right? How did you find us?
we escaped into the tunnels once the countdown started.
some of the scientists were caught. They didn't make it.
the machines that were guarding us are loading everything on this island into that ship.
we've got about ten minutes to stop that thing from blasting off.
Dex! Get us out of here!
good boy, Dex.
Thanks, Cap.
who are they? They're Unit 11.
or what's left of them.
they were brought here to finish what they started 30 years ago.
finish what?
tell them.
Totenkopf believed that humankind was doomed to extinction, so he proposed the unthinkable:
to build a vessel that would carry the building blocks of a new civilization into space.
he used his machines to collect specimens representing all life on Earth.
what Totenkopf called "The World of Tomorrow."
those vials that Dr. Jennings gave me, what were they?
Adam and Eve. Totenkopf's masterpiece.
seeds of a technological utopia.
we smuggled them off this island, knowing Totenkopf would never leave without them.
but now that he has them again, there is nothing left to keep him here.
then let him go. Let him go where he can't harm anyone.
no, no, no, that ship must never leave this Earth.
Why? What haven't you told us?
when the rocket reaches 100 kilometers, at the edge of space, Earth will be incinerated. How do we stop it?
only Totenkopf can stop it now. But we've never been allowed near him.
he's too well guarded even to be seen.
where is he? We're on our way, Cap.
good boy, Dex.
careful. Careful.
hurry, they'll be coming for us.
through there. That's the only way in.
you see, there is no way past them.
five minutes, Joe.
wait here. You'll be killed.
he knows what he's doing.
I think.
Hey, that's my gun!
Dex? Try shaking it.
we must hurry. Don't do it, you idiot!
doctor, stop!
who dares come before me?
who dares enter this place?
what has begun cannot be stopped.
the time for this world is over. Totenkopf.
Hello, doctor.
why are you doing this?
I have been witness to a world consumed by hatred and bent on self-destruction.
watched as we have taken what was to be a paradise and failed in our responsibilities as its steward.
I know now that the course the human race has set for itself cannot be changed.
I am the last, desperate chance for a doomed planet.
now, leave this place or die!
is it safe? Well, there's only one way to find out.
I meant throw something.
he's not here.
we're too late.
these are his personal papers.
he would never leave without them. He must still be here.
we must find him. I found him.
it's impossible.
it can't be.
the last entry in his journal was made on October 11, 1918.
he died over 20 years ago.
we've been chasing a ghost.
three minutes to liftoff.
they never stopped. They're finishing what they were programmed to do.
don't you see? This entire island is Totenkopf. Every wire, every gear.
he's found a way to cheat even his own death.
so how do we kill somebody who's already dead?
how do I stop it? Nothing can stop it now.
there must be some way. His machines would never allow it.
leave the machines to me. Dex, show me what to do.
if you can cut the lead in the system terminal, it should create a short...
...which will ignite the fuel line before the booster engines can fire and destroy the atmosphere. That's it?
that's all I have to do? The terminal's onboard the rocket.
you won't have time to escape.
contact Franky as soon as you're off the island.
she'll know exactly what to do. What are you talking about?
I'm going with you. Not this time.
we had a deal.
you're not gonna leave me now, just when things are getting interesting.
I won't let you. I wish we had more time.
and I only hope, one day, you can forgive me.
take care of her, Dex. Good luck, Cap.
one minute to liftoff.
we meet again, my mysterious friend.
how do you wanna do this?
nice shot, Polly.
what took you so long?
she's a machine.
ten seconds to liftoff.
we've gotta get those animals off the ship.
ninety kilometers to booster ignition.
there's no time.
that's our only way across.
eighty kilometers to booster ignition.
danger! Danger! Danger! Cargo release imminent!
what did you do now?
come on!
seventy kilometers to booster ignition.
sixty kilometers to booster ignition.
hold on!
please! Don't touch anything else!
there's no time. We'll never make it.
fifty kilometers to booster ignition.
run!
forty kilometers to booster ignition.
come in, Manta station. Do you read me?
thirty kilometers to booster ignition.
Franky, it's Dex. Do you read me?
it didn't work.
twenty kilometers to booster ignition.
Joe, you're running out of time. You've gotta do something.
and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth...
he thinks he's God. And God said unto Noah, the end...
shut up!
ten kilometers to booster ignition.
6 ...six... Why won't you die?
five kilometers to booster ignition.
warning. System failure.
booster malfunction.
danger. Danger.
danger.
warning. System failure.
booster malfunction. Look!
danger. Danger.
what is it? It might be our way out of here.
I see them, commander.
ready assault teams. All hands on deck.
one shot.
you got your story.
Polly.
you... It's all right.
you don't have to say anything.
lens cap.
Oh, come on...
you getting this? - Affirmative. Is it a threat?
countdown's initiated. The convoy is not in the zone yet.
an idiot's in the field. He'll blow the charges.
OK.
you gotta be kidding me.
civilians.
let's get a tune out of this trombone.
picking up a weapon signature.
shit. Not a civilian.
Aw, man...
asshole.
countdown is initiated.
you should so not be allowed to buy these things.
abort!
I think I got lD'd on that hit. You ever been lD'd on a hit?
not that I'm aware of, no. - Right. I'm in trouble.
you get a look at him? - Little thing. Buck ten, buck fifteen tops.
maybe he's Filipino.
I'm not even sure it was a him.
you saying that you had your ass handed to you by some girl?
I think so. A pro.
well, it shouldn't be that difficult. I mean, how many chicks are hitters out there?
you guys want any dessert? - What do you have, honey?
lce cream. - Delicious. What flavours?
chocolate and vanilla. - I don't like those.
but mixed together, that could be nice, you know what I mean?
and not just the little pink spoon, I like the whole sundae.
that could be arranged. - Perfect.
you hear that? I'd like to have her kick my ass, know what I mean?
any other details besides her weight class? - Laptop.
sorry? You're in a whole zone right now...
laptop. - OK, laptop.
I want to know who that bitch is. Get me that tape.
Jane. - Get me that tape.
what? - It's Father.
the FBl secured the package. The window's closed, sir.
I told you we couldn't afford mistakes. - There was another player.
we do not leave witnesses. If this player lD'd you. You know the rules.
you have 48 hours to clean the scene, Jane.
looking forward to it, sir.
all right, we have a new target. Let's find out who he is.
Jesus. What did you do to it?
put a campfire out with it?
buy a new one.
this one has sentimental value for its owner.
who's that? - Well, Gwen, I'm just hoping you can tell me.
so, why you gotta know so bad, anyway?
you know, just trying to return some lost property.
Hey, Phil. - Hey, John.
you a vegan? - No, my girlfriend is.
here we go.
upgraded RAM module.
chip's Chinese.
imported by Dynamix. Retailed by...
you know, I might be able to get you a billing address.
all right? No name, just an address.
570 Lexington Avenue, Suite 5003.
new York.
you know the place?
sweet Jesus! Mother of God...
why don't you both go make some coffee?
Jane, it's your husband.
he's back from Atlanta and he wants to know about dinner.
tell him. Dinner's at seven.
Hi, John. Yeah, she says dinner's at seven.
it always is perfect timing.
as always
this is a nice surprise. - I hope so.
you're home early. - I missed you.
I missed you, too.
shall we? - Yes.
thought these were for special occasions. - This is a special occasion.
pot roast. My favourite.
allow me, sweetheart.
been on your feet all day.
thank you.
sure.
so how's work?
actually, we had a little trouble with a commission.
is that right? - Yeah.
double booking with another firm.
green beans? - No, thank you.
you'll have some.
well, I hope everything worked out OK.
it hasn't yet.
but it will.
pot roast is my favourite.
sweetheart, could you pass the salt?
tried something new?
how was Atlanta?
had a few problems ourselves. Some figures didn't add up.
big deal? - Life or death. Wine?
I got it. - I'll get a towel.
Janie?
honey?
Jane!
Jane!
how could I be so stupid?
Jane!
Jane!
Oh, dear God...
wait. No, no. Accident.
honey? Accident.
Jane, stop the car, now.
Jane?
you're overreacting.
let's not get carried away.
we don't want to go to sleep angry. We can talk this out.
God!
pull over.
pull over! Pull over!
now, look...
we need to talk!
OK, I'm coming. Who is it? - Open up.
what the hell happened to you? - My wife.
she tried to kill me. - Yes. And you know what?
Gladys tried to kill me. Not with a car. At least Jane was a man about it.
but they all try to kill you. Slowly, painfully, cripplingly. And then, wham! They hurt you.
you know how hurt I used to be? I used to beat myself up. Now I'm great.
I got dates all the time. I just woke up from a thing, I'm in my robe.
you live with your mom. - I choose to.
because that's the only woman I've ever trusted.
it's unbelievable. - Look, I know exactly what you're thinking.
if she lied about that, what else has she lied about?
I mean, her job is a spy, to get information from people.
french Riviera. A yacht. An lranian prince.
she's supposed to get close to him and gain his trust. It's disgusting.
what? What are you saying?
what? Your husband is the shooter?
that's impossible.
Really?
this was probably planned from the beginning. Operation Stakeout Johnny.
a six-year stakeout to get information from you. Mission accomplished.
OK.
here's the upside.
you don't love him. - No.
you'll kill him, and nobody's better at that than you are.
thank you. - And then it'll be over.
look, I know you're embarrassed, but it's Eddie you're talking to.
the guys we work with, they don't know, I'm never gonna tell 'em.
the people she works with probably got a big laugh over this, but that's not important.
look, it's like 150 pages of a book have been written.
in the first 150 pages, Johnny's been a clown.
well, you can write the last ten pages. You been smoked, but you can write the last ten.
great talk, man. We should do it more often. It was great, I'm proud of you.
I'm gonna borrow this. - I like where your head's at, man.
I'll do it in the morning. - Yeah.
you OK? - Yeah.
OK. Good night. - Night.
you don't love him.
night, Johnny. - Night, Eddie.
good night, Mom.
OK, girls. Let's go.
pocket litter, receipts, matchbooks. You know the drill.
this is nice. Who picked this out?
what is this? - It looks like your wedding.
I know what it is. What are you doing? - Research on the target.
this room is wrapped. Thank you.
to have and to hold, to love and to cherish, till death do us part.
I promise.
I, John, take you, Jane, to be my lawfully wedded wife.
what's going on, Mrs Smith?
garden party, girls.
howdy, neighbour.
Wow. I can't believe I've never been in here before. This is great.
start with the living room. - Oh, yeah.
I love the floors. What are they, teak? - Red oak, Martin.
and you won the Golf Masters trophy this year.
again. - That'll be on your mantel next year.
bitch.
target profile is our main priority.
utilise all means necessary.
phone taps. Credit cards. Audio scan civilian frequencies.
with what, Jane?
you've reached the Smiths. We can't take your call, but leave a message after the tone and we'll get back to you.
and search the database. - For what? John Smith?
find him. - Jane?
what?
I think I found him. - Where?
here.
heat sensor breach in the perimeter.
commence scanning all floors.
I told you not to bother me at the office, honey.
well, you are still Mrs Smith. - Well, so are a lot of girls.
careful. I can push the button any time, anywhere.
baby, you couldn't find the button with both hands and a map.
last warning. You need to disappear.
no. - Now.
d sector clear.
you expect me to roll over and play dead? - Should be used to it after five years.
six. And I'm not leaving. - E sector clear.
anywhere, any time.
intruder detected.
evacuate plan C. - Evacuation in progress.
evacuation in progress.
evacuation in progress.
evacuation in progress.
chickenshit!
pussy!
you tell me you had a shot at her and you didn't take it?
we got all this stuff here, and you're trying to tell me you couldn't take her out?
well, now she's a problem for both of us. Now my house is priority one.
just gimme a hand, will you?
you're driving me crazy with the tongs and the furnace. You're like an insane man.
all right, they gave you 48 hours. What we got left here?
23？22？- 18 and change.
18 hours until they close the book on you? - Eddie?
mom, we're on high alert here! I almost killed you right then.
you do not even realise! - Never mind.
I am so done playing games with this broad.
you gotta take her out head-on. - Don't tell me how to handle my wife.
she's not your wife, she's the enemy. She could be outside now!
Eddie.
got it.
now we're talking. Only question is, how much is it to buy a vowel?
Blackbow Realty. - Hi, I'm from l-Temp.
great! How's our new penthouse working out?
well, just fine, thank you for asking.
this is security. There's a problem with your elevator, sir.
do you want an engineer to come see what the problem is?
take your time, I'm really quite comfortable.
are you really comfortable?
Jane?
is that you, sweetheart?
first and last warning, John. Get out of town.
you know I'm not going anywhere.
well, so you say. But right now, you're trapped in a steel box hanging 70 floors over nothing but air.
Oh, so this is a trap? - He's in car three.
it's never gonna work, honey.
because you constantly underestimate me.
do l? - You have no idea who I am.
you have no idea what I'm capable of.
well, back at you, baby. - Let me guess...
shaped charge on the counterbalance cable, two on the primary and secondary brakes?
maybe?
he found them. - Yes, thank you.
did you also get the base charge on the principle cable?
promise to leave town, or I'll blow it.
OK. I give up.
blow it.
what? - Go on, blow it.
you think I won't? - I think you won't.
OK.
any last words? - The new curtains are hideous.
goodbye, John.
what the hell was that? - What? You said goodbye.
the gas! Cut off the gas!
Jane?
Madame.
thought of a number of lines for this moment.
thought I'd just drop in. "Hey, doll, thanks for giving me the shaft."
nice. So what did you decide?
I want a divorce.
I like it. You proposed to me here, so it has agreeable symmetry.
coat, sir?
may I sit? - No.
champagne? - No, champagne's for celebrating.
I'll have a martini. - I'm fine, thank you.
so what do you want, John?
we have an unusual problem, Jane.
you obviously want me dead. And I'm less and less concerned of your wellbeing.
so what do we do?
do we shoot it out here? Hope for the best?
well, that would be a shame, because they'd probably ask me to leave once you're dead.
dance with me.
you don't dance. - That was just part of my cover, sweetheart.
was sloth part of it too?
think this'll have a happy ending?
happy endings are just stories that haven't finished yet.
satisfied?
not for years.
it's all John, sweetheart.
why is it you think we failed? Cos we were leading separate lives?
or was it all the lying that did us in?
I have a theory. Newly formed.
I'm breathless to hear it. - You killed us.
provocative.
you approached our marriage like a job, to be reconned, planned and executed.
and you avoided it.
what do you care, if I was just a cover?
well, who said you were just a cover?
wasn't l? - Wasn't l?
I have to... Excuse me.
no exits up there, Jane.
be cold, John. She's a liar.
be super cold.
come on, madam, this way.
do you know that you're ticking?
get back!
limo, sir?
Jane Smith.
that's the second time you tried to kill me. - It was just a little bomb.
I'm going home to burn everything I ever bought you.
I'll race you there, baby.
you there yet?
first time we met, what was your first thought?
you tell me.
I thought...
I thought you looked like Christmas morning.
I don't know how else to say it.
and why are you telling me this now?
guess in the end you start thinking about the beginning.
so there it is. I thought you should know.
so how about it, Jane? Hm?
I thought...
I thought that you were the most beautiful mark I'd ever seen.
so it was all business, yeah? - All business.
from the go. - Cold, hard math.
thank you. That's what I needed to know.
OK.
Hey, John.
Hey, Bill.
are you all right? - Yeah.
OK.
uh, by the way, John, your car is hanging out over the sidewalk here.
Yeah, thanks, Bill. - OK. Have a good night.
good night.
shit.
shit.
you still alive, baby?
your aim's as bad as your cooking, sweetheart.
and that's saying something.
come on, honey.
come to Daddy.
who's your daddy now?
can't do it.
don't! Come on.
come on!
you want it?
it's yours.
Hi, stranger.
Hiya back.
yeah? - Everything OK? We heard an awful ruckus.
no, everything's fine here. Yeah, it's great. - So you guys are fine?
Yeah, couldn't be better.
nice. You guys are...
Suzy, Martin. - Have a nice night.
looks like you're redecorating, it's very... Yeah. Shame about the red oak.
five more minutes, Mom...
tempting. But I don't get out of bed for less than half a million dollars.
that left of yours... A thing of beauty. - You take it well.
thank you.
that vacation in Aspen?
you left early. Why?
jean-luc Gaspard. - Oh, God!
Yeah. - I wanted him.
forget it.
you didn't hear me that night the chopper dropped me off for our anniversary dinner.
no. - No?
percussion grenades. I was partially deaf that night.
I'm slightly colour blind.
retinal scarring. - I can't feel anything in these three fingers.
three ribs. Broken eye socket. Perforated eardrum.
you ever have trouble sleeping after?
Nope. - Yeah, me neither.
go, go, go. Look out.
move it.
shoes.
I was given 48 hours to take you out.
same.
Jesus, where's the trust?
what do you expect?
why do I get the girl gun?
are you kidding me? - No.
we need a car.
Colemans.
guy's had my barbecue set for months.
I was never in the Peace Corps. - What?
I really liked that about you.
maybe this honesty thing isn't such a good idea.
I didn't go to MlT. - Really?
Notre Dame. Art History major.
art? - History.
it's reputable. - OK.
fuckers get younger every year.
I have to tell you, I never really liked your cooking.
it's not your gift.
baby, I've never cooked a day in my life.
I-Temp girls cooked.
web of lies!
I like it. Deal with it.
we got company. - What?
shit.
baby, hold steady now! - It's called evasive driving, sweetheart.
hold still.
this thing's all over the place. How do you drive these things?
honey!
honey, let me drive. - I got it.
move over. Move.
I'm the suburban housewife, sweetheart.
you move. - Fine. Go.
go. - Go.
they're bulletproof.
they're bulletproof!
I think I should probably tell you.
I was married once before.
what is wrong with you? - You're what's wrong with me.
it was a drunken Vegas thing. - That's better. That's much better. Great.
stop it.
go, go, go!
her name and social security number? - No, you're not gonna kill her.
these doors are handy.
you know, sweetheart, you're being a bit hypocritical.
it's not like you're some beacon of truth.
John, my parents...
they died when I was five. I'm an orphan.
who was that kindly fellow who gave you away at our wedding?
paid actor.
I said I saw your dad on Fantasy Island.
I know.
I don't even want to talk about it.
you got it? - Got it.
any time. - I got it.
we're gonna have to redo every conversation we've ever had.
I'm Jewish.
can't believe I brought my real parents to our wedding.
disgusting. How could you serve this?
ma'am, is it possible to get this reheated? Miss? Miss, I'm talking to you. Excuse me?
Jesus, Johnny.
good morning, Eddie. - Morning.
it's good to see you're OK.
tell me you got smart and that you killed that lying bitch.
this lying bitch?
guess it was just wishful thinking.
I'm sorry. - Eddie.
nice to see you, Jane. - Eddie. Eddie! Focus. We got problems.
problems? Crack addicts got problems, my friend. You two are smoked.
maybe. - Maybe?
you got the entire agency gunning for you. Probably her agency, too.
and what about you? Where you at? - Me? Where am I at?
I find myself dragging my feet this morning.
I think you owe me a little money, anyway.
so what do... - We don't understand each other.
but I don't need those looks, OK? I been in his life a long time.
focus, Eddie, focus. - A long time.
I'm pissed off. They blew up my house, they shot at my wife. My own company.
if she works for who the street says that she works for...
you're Macy's and Gimbel's. Then she would be the WE channel, and you would be...
whatever channel competes against the WE channel. Know what I'm saying?
the point is simple. Once you guys get off the reservation, that's it.
then you're off the reservation. - Eddie, how bad?
how bad is it?
you remember Canada.
kids' stuff next to this. - That was you?
is that a turn-on? Didn't she try to kill you with a car?
a good friend stays out of it. This is the facts.
if you two separate from each other, you got a shot. Not a great shot, Johnny, but a shot.
you two stay together, you're dead.
unless you can find something they want more than they want you.
found him. He's being held in sub-basement D of the federal courthouse.
high security, motion and thermal. Power's on the city grid.
this is as far as we go, Jane.
right. Thanks for everything. - Good luck, baby.
and this north-westerly blow coming down from the middle of the country... Do you guys mind changing the channel?
one is moving in now... Nick? Would you please get off your fat ass and change the channel?
I know it's tough. Thank you. -Tomorrow, that's going to make things...
30 second window. I cut the power, you grab the kid. Simple and clean. Got it?
got it.
tell me, how many?
does it matter?
should I go first? - OK.
I don't exactly keep count, but...
I would say...
high 50s, low 60s.
I've been around the block, but the important thing is...
312
312?
how? - Some were two at a time.
honey? - I'm...
you monitoring the perimeter? - I checked the perimeter.
what about the police bands? - I'm on the police bands.
connected... - This is not my first time.
think we've established that.
all right.
turn left.
left, John.
left.
you don't need to talk to me like that. OK? Be nice.
left, please. - I can't go left.
see? There is no left. Look.
I have straight, or back the way I came.
there's no left. Which way do you want?
just stay there and wait for my mark. - See what I'm sitting in?
you see that?
take your time. - Yeah, all right! Stay.
stay there, wait for my mark. I'll find it.
wait for my mark.
almost there. I don't know what happened. Just hold on.
John, what are you doing? What are you doing?
cut the lights on my signal.
now. Kill the lights.
Jane, kill the lights. - What's that?
where? - Turn 'em back on! Idiot!
here they come. - Uncuff me.
turn 'em back on. Turn 'em back on!
turn 'em back on! - All right!
give me the light! - Shut up!
Nick! - Shut up.
give me a gun. Nick, give me a gun!
zip it!
this guy's a wily one.
you didn't wait for my signal. - I improvised.
you deviated from the plan. - Plan was flawed.
the plan was not flawed. - Anal.
organised. - Jane, 90 per cent of this job is instinct.
your instincts set off the alarms. - And got the job done. Not The Jane Show...
no, it was The John Show. Half-assed. Like Christmas, our anniversary, the time you forgot to bring my mother's birthday present.
your fake mother's birthday. - You are always the first to break team.
you don't want a team, you want a servant for hire.
I want someone I can count on.
Jane, there's no air around you any more. - OK, what is that supposed to mean?
it means there's no room for mistakes, no mistakes whatsoever. No spontaneity.
who can answer to that? - Well, you don't have to.
cos this isn't even a real marriage.
who are you people? - Shut up!
OK. So, now I realise you witnessed the missus and l working through some domestic issues.
that's regrettable.
but don't take that as a sign of weakness. That would be a mistake.
now, tell us what you know.
why do both our bosses want you dead?
you underst... Honey.
please?
wrap it up.
maybe it's not a good idea to undermine me in front of the hostage.
sends a mixed message.
sorry.
girls.
OK. Where was l?
a mistake on your part. - Shut up. Options.
I'm gonna lay out your options for you, OK? Option A...
if I could... - Shut up.
option A. You talk, we listen, no pain.
option B. You don't talk.
I remove your thumbs with my pliers. It will hurt.
I like to vary the details a bit, but the punch line is, you die.
Benjamin? We're impatient people, Benjamin.
can I get a soda? Or a juice, or some...
a, option A!
ow, that hurt! - OK, that was a nice shot.
what's... You got a spasm?
I'm tied up. Why don't you check my back pocket?
I'm not the target. You are. Both of you.
they found out you're married, so they teamed up and sent you to the same hit.
it was a joint task force, both companies.
two competing agents living under the same roof? It's bad for business.
they wanted you to take each other out. - You were bait.
well, it's entry level. Toehold into the company.
couple hits, they bump me up to a desk. It's pretty cool, actually.
you keep the photo in your pocket? - Was I supposed to frame it?
you get rid of it. You burn it. Tradecraft 101.
guess I skipped that day. I guess you skipped the day about not marrying the enemy.
you were bait or you are bait?
belt! Belt, belt, dude.
two minutes.
one minute.
a little help? - Clear.
clear.
my way out is a boat standing by in La Paz.
cargo drop, Atlas Mountains. So what?
so at least apart we know what the odds are.
let's just call this what it is.
and what it isn't.
all right, so it's a crap marriage.
all right, I'm a mess, you're a disaster.
we're both liars.
but you run, you'll always be running.
I say we stay and fight.
we finish this thing.
then if you want to go, you can go.
well, thank you.
what? "Let's call this what it is." Jesus Christ...
stop... - Don't.
this is a really good store.
see you in the next life, Jane. - Likewise, John.
sorry.
we'll talk about this later.
Jesus!
I didn't touch a thing. - Yes, you did.
sorry about the knife in the... - I don't want to talk about it.
I'll fly. - I'll be bait.
I'm going clockwise. Watch my six.
go! Move!
how's it look?
it's a piece of cake.
watch these, they tend to jam.
so watch 'em.
you favour your left, sweetheart, so I'll cover right.
damn, that boat in La Paz is looking pretty good right now, isn't it?
well, it rains a lot this time of year.
there's nowhere I'd rather be than right here, with you.
shut up.
I'm interested in the progress you've made in the last few weeks.
doing all right, aren't we? I'm not gonna lie to you, there were times when I wanted to...
kill her, but... - Likewise.
couldn't take the shot. - That's a good sign.
who'd have thought? - You have to battle through.
that's marriage, right? - Yeah. Take your best shot, and...
Oh, we redid the house. - We did. Yes, we did.
you know there will always be challenges? Threats out there?
Yup.
but you can handle it together.
so far. - Yes, we can... So far?
what is that?
I'm leaving room for the unknown. - So far.
and do you feel your relationship styles are more conducive to this... Ask us the sex question.
John.
well, that...
ten.
the earth
is in a blaze
the world
is in a maze
the way of life today
is strange and odd
what happened across the sea

let's go back to God - Let us go back - Let's go back to God - Come on - Let's go back to God - Let us go back - Let's go back to God - I know the way - Let's go back to God - Without my Lord - Let's go back to God - It's mighty hard - Let's go back to God - Whoa, yeah - Let's go back to God - That I know the path - Let's go back to God - Wander path, yeah - Let's go back to God - Left his mark - Let's go back to God - Of hallowed troughs - Let's go back to God - Come on, yes - Let's go back to God - Let us go back - Let's go back to God - Go back to God - Come, let us go back
to God

Oh, Afternoon, Mrs, Munson,

Mackatee Funthes?
Oh, no, not him, Weemack, - Mackatee's eldest, - Oh, yeah, - I don't believe I do, - Well, he's a good boy and all, but he done gone down to the Costco in Pascagoula and got hisself a blaster, - What? - And he been playing that music, - Well, if you want, you know, I could, - Loud!

2000 years after Jesus! 30 years after Martin Luther King!
the age of Montel!
Mm-mm-mm! - Sweet lord of mercy, - is that where we at? - Mm-hm,
Weemack down to Pascagoula and gettin' hisself a big ol' thumpety stereo so he can listen to that trash!

Othar, I went and complained about Weemack today,
don't know if it'll do any good,
that boy hangin' by a thread, Over the pit,
fiery pit! "Left My Wallet in El Segundo,
Ooh!
67 years of life, 46 years of marriage,
you mean to tell me you never once suffered from piles?
well, it's the human condition,
most humans, anyhow,
like that ballplayer said, "The world's got two kind of folks,
them that's got the piles and them that's goin' get 'em,
but you always was healthy as an ox,
passed on 'fore you could get the piles, Mm-hm,
Ooh, thank the Lord you never was sick,
I just want to pass away nice and peaceful,
go to sleep one night, wake up in the glory land! Whoo!
pickles!
go fetch Pickles! - Pickles?
Oh, he's up that tree again! You'd better shimmy on up,
well, I do apologize, madam, but, won't the feline eventually tire of his lonely perch and, pining for his master's affection, return on his own initiative?
uh, the point being, must we actually ascend the tree?
look, I don't want no doubletalk,
now, if you not gon' fetch him, I guess I gotta call the police, - Police? - And they not goin' be happy,
every time they have to fetch him, they swear they'll never do it no more,
no need to call the authorities, madam,
I did this often as a child,
I was a positive lemur, Here, kitty!
Oh, don't upset him now! - I wouldn't think of it, madam,
harmless little Felix domesticus,
here, Kitty, Come to G, H,
come, come, Here, kitty, Here, kitty,
come, come, come, No, no, no,
that's not how Sheriff Wyner do it,
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Come, come, come,
come to the professor,
Yes, Y, Ah!
uh, thank you, madam, for your act of kindness, - Well, you let him out, - I certainly did, and for that I apologize no end,
allow me to present myself, um, formally,
Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, Ph, D,
like Elmer?
I beg your pardon, ma'am? - Fudd,
no, no, Ph, D, is a mark of academic attainment bestowed, in my case, in recognition of my mastery of the antique languages of Latin and Greek,
I also hold a number of other advanced degrees, including the baccalaureate from a school in Paris, France, called the Sorbonne,
sore bone, Well, that fits,
you ever study at Bob Jones University?
I have not had that privilege,
Oh, that's a Bible school, Only the finest in the country, - I send 'em $5 every month, - That is very generous, - I'm on the mailin' list! I'm a Angel, - Are you? Yes,
Oh, they list my name in the newsletter every issue, - Do they? - Oh, I got the literature right over here, - if you'd like to examine it, - Perhaps when my head has recovered from its, uh, uh, buffeting,
Mrs. Munson, are you at all curious as to why I darkened your door, as the expression would have it, on this lovely, lovely camellia-scented morn?
well, I was wonderin' till you let Pickles out, - I quite understand, - Then in all the excitement,
the fact is, I saw the sign in your window advertising a room to let?
and there are no other such signs among the houses - on this charming, charming street, - Yeah, I got a room, $1 5 a week, I'm lookin' for a quiet tenant,
madam, you are addressing a man who is quiet and yet not quiet, If I may offer a riddle,
I am currently on sabbatical from the institution where I teach, the University of Mississippi at Hattiesburg,
I am takin' a year off to indulge my passion, and I do not believe that is too strong a word, - for the music of the Renaissance, - Mm-hm,
I perform in, and have the honor of directing, a period-instrument ensemble that performs at Renaissance Fairs and other cultural fora throughout central and southern Mississippi,
we perform on the instruments for which the music was originally composed,
now, wait a minute, You got some kind of band?
Oh, no, The word "band" would be, in this context, something of a misnomer,
though we do play together, hence the word "ensemble," the nature of the music is such that, well, one would hesitate to apply the epithet "band"
with connotations of janglin' rhythms, - So y'all ain't playin' no hippity-hop?
"l Left My Wallet in El Segundo," Songs with the titles spelled all funny?
Oh, no, no, We play music that has been composed to the greater glory of God,
devotional music, Church music,
gospel music?
well, inspired by the gospel, certainly,
the vintage, of course, is no more recent than the Rococo,
Rococo, huh? Well, I guess that'd be OK,
but I don't propose to inflict our rehearsals on you,
may I inquire, do you have a root cellar?
Ah... Yes.
Yes, yes,
this looks promising,
Alittledank, ain't it?
indeed, That only improves the acoustics,
marvelous,
Yes, Ah!
Oh, these earthen walls are ideal for baffling the higher registers of the, uh, lute or sackbut,
that is why so much music of the cinquecento was played in crypts and catacombs, This is ideal, This is perfect, This is more than perfect, - I can scarcely contain my glee, - Oh, you containin' it OK,
you gotta peel this shit out, man, Sometimes it stick to the bottom,
Hey, this shit smells like piles,
you wouldn't even believe this, man, Even out here on the casino floor you gonna find goddamn mercy pads, Tucks,
I don't know what the fuck people be doin' here while they gamblin',
man, I ain't peelin' no funky shit with my human hands,
that ain't nothin' but a prescription for diseases and viruses - and shit attackin' your fuckin' insides, - Oh, well, shit, you gotta do it, 'cause Mr, Gudge checks everything,
this tunnel leads back onto the land for all the people that work for Mannex,
Mannex Corporation, They own the Bandit Queen, three other boats,
now, this is where they think on their corporate shit, Gudge and them,
I mean, the light's as ugly as all hell, but, shit, ain't as many Tucks, - Let me in, motherfucker! - What's the password?

it's authentic, Strapped on, of course, so it can't fall off,
now, the animal is free to be as active as he wants,
it doesn't inhibit his movement in any way, and, , l think it really sells the whole doughboy thing, - It looks like a fucking joke, - Uh, you're absolutely right,
the gas mask is a whimsical concept,
how the hell does it eat when it gets to the Nibbles Ready-to-Eat?
well, you're absolutely right, - Don't let the clients see this, - Or that Humane fucker, - No, of course not,

I know you all remember that when Moses came down the mountain carrying the Word of God, come down that Sinai peak, - he caught them lsraelites red-handed, - Yes!
What'd he catch 'em doin'?
he caught 'em worshippin'
a golden calf, - Yes!
he caught 'em worshippin'
a false god,
he caught them lsraelites in decline,
in decline!
what did Moses do when he saw those, declinin', backslidin', never-mindin' sinners?
what did he do?
mosses smote those sinners in his wrath! Yes, he did!
y'all know what "smote" is?
I smite, you smite, he smites, we done smote!
to smite is to go upside the head!
because sometimes, brothers and sisters, that's the only way!
the only way,
to smite is to remind we got to stop that decline and scramble back up to the face of the Almighty God!
Amen! - lnstead of worshippin'
that golden calf, that earthly trash on that garbage island,
that garbage island in the shadowland, wa-a-ay, way outside the Kingdom of God!
that garbage island, where scavenger birds feast on the bones of the backslidin' damned!
and so, let us pray,
my dear lady, I do so hope this is not an inopportune time for our first practice,
somebody die?
I beg your pardon? Oh!
no, no, no, No, I'm not bereaved,
though it is so kind of you to inquire, The hearse is simply a vehicle commodious enough to accommodate all the members of our ensemble,
and, of course, our instruments contrived in an age ignorant of miniaturization,
allow me to introduce my friends, my colleagues, these devoted and passionate musicians,
ain'tno smokin' in this house
Oh, Sorry,
what do you think, General? Present any problems?
good then, Gentlemen, why don't we crowd around and go over the plan?
gentlemen, this is the Bandit Queen, Gambling den, Cash cow,
sodom of the Mississippi Delta and the focus of our little exercise,
here is Orchard Street,
here is the residence of Marva Munson, the charming lady whom you all met moments ago,
gentlemen, I'm sure you're all aware that the Solons of the state of Mississippi, to wit, its legislature, have decreed that no gaming establishment shall be erected within its borders upon dry land,
they may, however, legally float,
while the gambling activity is restricted to these riverboats, no such restrictions apply to the functions ancillary to this cash-besotted business,
the casino's offices, locker rooms, facilities to cook and clean, and, most importantly, its counting houses, the reinforced, secret, super-secure repositories of the lucre, may all be situated, wherever, - Gawain, where is "wherever"? - Say what?
Where's the money? - Oh,
OK, look, At the end of every shift, pit boss brings the cash down to the hold of the ship in a locked cashbox, and once a day all the cash is moved down to the countin' room,
Andwhere isthe counting room
uh, it be right there in that square where you pointin',
and what, to flog a horse that if not dead is at this point in mortal danger of expiring, does this little square represent?
offices, Underground,
ha! Underground! Mmm!
underground,
during the casino's hours of operation, the door to this counting room is fiercely guarded,
the door itself is of redoubtable Pittsburgh steel,
when the casino closes this entire underground complex is locked up, and the armed guard retreats to the casino's main entrance,
there, then, far from the guard, reposes the money, behind a five-inch-thick steel portal, yes, But the walls, the walls are but humble masonry behind which is only the soft, loamy soil deposited over centuries by the Old Man, the meanderin' Mississippi, as it fanned its way back and forth across the great alluvial plain, leaving earth,
this earth,
the General here, whose curriculum vitae comprehends massive tunnelin' experience through the soil of his native French lndochina, shall be directin' our little old tunnelin' operation,
Garth Pancake, though a master of none, is a jack of all those trades corollary to our aim,
he will be doin' such fabricatin' and demolition work - as our little caper shall require, - Happy to be on board,
gawain is our proverbial "inside man."
he has managed to secure himself a berth on the custodial staff of the Bandit Queen, - Damn skippy! - And this brings us to Lump,
to look at Lump, you might wonder what specialized expertise could he possibly offer our merry little old band of miscreants,
well, gentlemen, in a project of such risks, it is imperative to enlist the services of a hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute,
someone who will be our security, our battering ram, our blunt instrument,
and, on our behalf, I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome, - Fuckin' A, - Whassup, my nigga?
well, gentlemen, here you are,
men of different backgrounds and differing talents,
men with, in fact, but two things in common:
one, you all saw fit to answer my advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar, and two, you're all going to be, in consequence, very, very, incredibly, rich,
let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen,
let us make beautiful music together, and, by all means, let us keep this to ourselves,
what we say in this root cellar, let it stay in this root cellar,
there's no "l" in "team,"
trouble in and trouble out
trouble's what this world's about
troubles of this world the Devil's in this world
trouble in, trouble out
trouble's what this world's about
troubles of this world the Devil's in this world
you up the river without a paddle in a lot of trouble
without a doubt you going under running out of bubbles
pass me the body bag watch me dump 'em
it ain 't nothing for you to get squashed like a pumpkin
I try so hard and play my cards afraid to fall, I ain 't involved
I gotta call I'm much appalled
I came to OZ and broke the laws
bring on the casket ain 't too glad 'Cause dirty hazard wrapped in plastic
it's OK, Don't stop on account of me,
no, No, no, no, no, Not at all, madam,
not at all, We were about to take a break anyway,
the glissandi on this particular piece are technically very, very demanding, and I'm sure we would all welcome a moment of R and R,
well, I just thought maybe you'd like to see,
what have you gotten into, honey? Why you sweatin' like that?
uh, Uh,
uh, eh, 'cause, 'cause, That boy right there?
he plays one bitch barrel full of a sackbut!
ain't that right, Lump? - Uh-huh,
I'm tellin' you, he can tear it up, Right, Lump?
ain't nobody play the sackbut like Lump right there, He,
don't be shy, Lump, Don't be shy, Lump, that boy, he go, at it like it was some pussy!
Oh, shit! - Mind your mouth!
this is a Christian house, boy, No hippity-hop language in here, - Sometime it's the only way, - Now listen, you ain't gonna hit me,
I'm tryin' to help you, boy, better yourself!
and so you should, madam, So you should,
gawain is so far transported by his love of the music of the early Renaissance,
don't make me no never-mind, he transported!
I understand, - You been smokin'?
Oh, certainly not, ma'am, I understand your indignation, ma'am,
and I was offering an explanation, not an excuse, - I myself am, - Hey, hey, hey, , don't be explainin' me, dawg!
you can't read my motherfuckin' mind, man!
you might got yo' Ph, D, but I got my GED!
Yes, - Nigga!
a fiery lad, but then youth is fiery,
a fact often remarked upon by the poets of the Romantic era,
my youth, I was in church, I wasn't walkin' around fiery,
youth ain't no excuse for nothin',
anyhow, I just came to show you the fife, Othar's fife, Burned his own,
I thought maybe, you bein' a man of music, you'd be interested,
Oh, indeed I am,
cut it hisself and burned his holes,
the lsraelites called it a khalil,
Yeah, you can read all about it in the Bible, Ain't nothin' new under the sun,
indeed not,
gone these 20 years,
he was some kind of man,
blowed the khalil,
I don't suppose Othar ever turned his hand or, or turned his lip to blowing the shofar?
the ceremonial ram's horn sounded by the priests of the Hebrews,
no, I don't know nothin' about that, Othar never blowed no shofar!
of course not, - Not to the extent of my knowledge,
the khalil was good enough for my Othar,
he was some kind of man,
some kind of man,
Oh, goddamn! Come on, girl, let me get one little peek,
don't be cruel, Come on, just one butt cheek,
pull that ass out and make it clap,
Aw, just 'cause I'm dressed like a janitor, don't mean you gotta do me dirty,
this muthafucka's hit the jackpot, Come on, girl,
come over here and blow on these dice,
you know, I'm a seven on the roll now, but I'm a 1 0 the hard way, and I ain't just talkin' crap,
Mr. Gudge, she had a ass that could pull a bus.
I mean, Gudge, it was more than an ass, it was literature,
Yeah, I don't care how big her ass was, MacSam, You're fired,
you say what?
there is no fraternizing with customers on the Bandit Queen, - Clean out your locker, - But, Mr, Gudge, I wasn't fraterniz,
I said get outta here, You're fired,
you can't fire me! I'll sue your ass!
sue me? For what?
for fuckin' punitive damages, man!
punitive damages, - Yeah,
punitive damages, You goddamn skippy!
punitive damages, - I see why you firin' me, Mr, Gudge,
Yeah, it's simple and plain, You firin' me 'cause I'm black,
MacSam, everybody on the custodial staff is black,
your replacement is gonna be black,
his replacement, no doubt, will be black!
well, the fuckin' judge is goin' be black, muthafucka, - Oh, - And you?
you gon' stand tall before the man, - Oh,
and your replacement's gonna be black, - muthafucka! - Thank you,
Oh, my,
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
this is a severe setback,
I am distraught, I'm more than distraught,
I am devastated,
I-I'm beside myself, I'm at a positive loss for words, - You still talkin' OK, though, - Have you all decided?
madam, we must have waffles, We must all have waffles forthwith,
we must all think, We must all have waffles and think, each and every one of us, to the very best of his ability,
perhaps if you apologized to the man and gave him flowers,
or perhaps a fruit basket with a card depicting a misty seascape and inscribed with a sentiment,
I ain't apologizin' to that muthafucka, He fired me 'cause I'm black!
he can't do that, You could sue him, Open and shut case, - Fuckin' A, - Surely a chocolate assortment has been known to melt the heart of even the hardest misanthrope,
that man ain't rollin' over for no fucking candy bar,
uh, we've had a bit of a setback on the tunneling front, too, - We've run into a pretty large rock, - Rock!
very bad, Very bad, - Oh, my,
seems that the poet was right,
troubles never singly come,
Oh, no, we can get through the rock, No worries there,
easiest thing in the world, Why, we just blow right through it,
I got a pyro license, Just, uh, bore a hole in the rock and pack in a little plastique, lgneous blows pretty good, - And then we could, - Hello, Garth, - Am I ordering the primer cord? - Yes, Mountain,
we were just talking about that, and some plastique, - What the fuck is this? - Oh, this is Mountain Girl,
mountain is my right hand, She helps me out with ordnance, - Helps me with, damn near everything, - Hey,
you brought yo' bitch to the Waffle Hut?
I must confess myself to be puzzled as well,
I thought it was understood that when it came to our little enterprise, "mum" was the word,
of course, I understand that, but this is Mountain Girl,
I don't keep secrets from Mountain,
that's not how you maintain a loving, caring relationship,
you brought yo' bitch to the Waffle Hut!
the man brought his bitch, to the Waffle Hut!
all right, look, you, I will thank you to stop referring to Mountain that way,
she is the other half of my life,
everybody lookin' at me like I'm some kind of fuck-up for losin' a sorry-ass job, and this muthafucka brings his bitch - to the muthafuckin' Waffle Hut! - Son-of-a-bitch punk!
shut your goddamn mouth! - You better raise the fuck up, fucka!
gentlemen, please, - Back the fuck up!
you gon' back that shit the fuck up!
gentlemen, please, - What?! What?!
please, gentlemen, this behavior does you no credit in the eyes of your colleagues, nor in those of the other patrons of this Waffle Hut,
little punk,
Oh, look at this, I got blueberry syrup on my safari jacket!
gentlemen, I propose that we consider the matter of this woman, - Mountain Water, - Mountain Girl,
I'm so very sorry, I propose that we consider this matter closed,
and we shall choose to trust her since we have no choice, and since she shall share only in Mr, Pancake 's portion of the booty,
of course, Wouldn't have it any other way, - Yeah, you damn right you won't, - Up yours, punk, - Oh, fuck you and the Swiss Miss, - The matter of disposing - of our igneous impediment is also, - C-Coach, Coach, - C-C-Coach, l, -, closed, Settled,
that leaves us only with the question of Gawain retrieving his job, - Coach, l, - Yes, Lump?
couldn't we just bribe the guy?
you are a readin' fool, aren't you, Mr, Dorr?
Yes, I must confess,
I often find myself more at home in these ancient volumes than I do in the hustle-bustle of the modern world,
to me, paradoxically, the literature of the so-called "dead tongues" holds more currency than this morning's newspaper.
in these books, in these volumes, there is the accumulated wisdom of mankind, which succors me when the day is hard and the night lonely and long,
mm, The wisdom of mankind, huh?
what about the wisdom of the Lord? - Oh,
Yes, yes, The Good Book, mm, I have found reward in its pages,
but, to me, there are other good books as well,
heavy volumes of antiquity freighted with the insights of man's glorious age,
and then, of course, I just love, love, love the works of Mr, Edgar Allan Poe,
Oh, I know who he was, Kinda spooky,
no, madam, no, no,
not of this world, it's true,
he, he lived in a dream, an ancient dream, "Helen."
thy beauty is to me
like those Nicean barks of yore,
that gently, o'er a perfumed sea,
the weary, wayworn wanderer bore
to his own native shore,
who was Helen?
some kinda whore of Babylon? - One doesn't know who Helen was, but I picture her as being very, very, extremely, pale,
Mrs. Munson, I have been trying to figure out some way of expressin' my gratitude to you for takin' in this weary, wayworn wanderer.
it's just a little old present, Why, it's hardly anything at all,
Oh, why, Mr, Dorr! You are a gallant man,
Oh, madam, I blush, I melt, No,
I just happened to hear of this gospel concert tomorrow night, "The Mighty, Mighty Clouds of Joy," and I thought you and a friend from church perhaps would,?
Yes, I have a widow lady friend, - The concert is up in Memphis, so I have arranged a car service to transport you thither,
ah?
why, Sheriff Wyner! How you doin'?
good evenin', Mrs. Munson.
I just stopped by here to let you know I did have a talk with Weemack, and he told me he's gonna comply with your request in keepin' that music down and neighborly,
so you just go and have yourself a pleasant evenin',
wait a minute, I got somebody that I want you to meet,
uh, ma'am, you know what? I'm, I'm a little pressed for time,
you got a gang of bank robbers youse chasin'?
come on in here and say hello,
Yeah, we was in here, havin' tea and,
huh!
bussed his own dishes, You can always tell a gentleman, - Somebody was in here, ma'am? - Yeah, with me and Othar,
well, you know what? Maybe I'll catch him the next time,
Oh, come on up to his room with me and say hello,
I got a family, My wife got dinner on the table,
I really have to be goin', - Oh, my, He is neat! - Yes, ma'am, he very neat,
he probably went down to the cellar to play with his friends,
ma'am, I really got to be goin' now, - What,? - Ma'am, I really need to be gettin' back,
Mrs. Munson, don't. You don't have to.
Mrs. Munson?
why, Professor!
what in the world are you doin' havin' tea down there?
uh, Mrs, Munson?
Oh, Lord Jesus, - Mrs, Munson? - Land of Goshen, child!
come on out from under there! - Mrs, Munson, my pager just went off,
I got to go, Mm-hm, I'll meet you and your friend later,
that was refreshing,
y'all have a good evenin' now!
as you know, we academics are inordinately fond of wedgin' ourselves - into confined spaces, - Mm!
at Yale, the students will see how many of their number they can enclose in a telephone booth, At Harvard, a broom closet,
Oh! Hope I didn't spill my tea,
well, what the hell is this?
I guess it's just my way of sayin', um,
Oh, well, goddamn it, Mr, Gudge, Look here, l,
I don't know what it's like walkin' in your shoes,
you know, with you bein' a tight-ass and all,
and I'm pretty sure you don't know what it's like walkin' in my shoes,
see, Mr, Gudge, there's the custodian, right?
and then there's the man inside the custodian,
and that's the motherfucker we got a problem with,
see, 'cause that man, he got needs, Mr, Gudge, and normally those needs gotta do with women with big asses,
I guess my point bein' is I realize I'm a bunkie junkie,
but if you woulda seen the kettle drums on this girl, Mr, Gudge, whew!
well, we all human,
this apology buys you a one-week probationary period,
thank you, Mr, Gudge,
stay away from the customers, MacSam,
this drill bit's getting awfully hot,
Gawain, maybe you could fill a Hudson sprayer and spritz it down while I drill,
fuck you, I ain't your motherfuckin' house nigger, I'm the inside man,
all right, look, are you gonna have a bug up your ass for the rest of the time we work together?
I'll get the sprayer, - Oh, no, no, No,
me and this gentleman here have to get square,
let me tell you somethin', MacSam,
I'm gonna tell you about how I came down to Mississippi,
I wasn't born here, you know, I'm from Scranton, Pennsylvania,
what the fuck?
Scranton, Pennsylvania, Came down here in 1 964, Greyhound bus,
with the Freedom Riders,
do you know who the Freedom Riders were, MacSam?
no, and I don't give a fuck,
just tell me when the fuck they gonna leave, Damn!
the Freedom Riders, my fine young man, were a group of concerned liberals from up north, all working together, just like we are here,
involved citizens who came down here so that local black folk could have their civil liberties,
so that people like you could have the vote, - You know what, man? - What, brother?
I don't vote, So fuck you, - You little fuckin' ingrate, - And the bus you rode in on, jackass! - Let's step outside, MacSam!
fuck the outside! Come on! What?!
my friend Mrs, Funthes is here, so I'm about to go out,
just thought I'd leave y'all with some cinnamon cookies,
why, that is lovely,
Ooh, y'all sound good!
maybe you could come by the church one Sunday, - give us a recital, - Why, how kind of you!
our music, however, is, uh, well, how shall I put this?
uh, a bit Roman in its outlook,
uh, many of our pieces were commissioned by the Holy See,
Oh, I see, all right, but we don't make no big whoop-dee-do about denomination,
everybody welcome at our church, Yeah, we had a Methodist come in,
Episcopalian, Back in the '60s, we had a Jew come in!
he had a guitar, - A Jew with a guitar,
if you will excuse me one moment, madam, I shall, uh, I shall see you out,
if you gentlemen can labor harmoniously in the course of my absence, perhaps upon my return we shall be prepared to explode that vexin' old piece of igneous,
Oh, Professor! This is Mrs, Funthes,
Enchante, Mrs, Funthes, Allow me,
rosalie, this is Professor G, H, Dorr, Ph, D,
Oh, my, That's an awful lot of letters,
Oh, well, no,
of course, in my youth, I was known simply as Goldthwait,
Uh-huh,
all right safetymeeting.
let's listen up, General, can you hand me the primer cord?
before we set the charge, we will run through our procedure,
I have earplugs for whoever wants them, Just wedge those right in your ears,
now, here we have, Not yet, Lump, - Oh, - Now, primer cord,
Gelatinite, C-4,
time comes, we pack the hole in the rock with the C-4
and insert two leads: A and B,
I remember my father sayin' to me
and it's one of the few memories I retain of the man from one of his visits home, and how I do cherish it
he said to me, "Goldthwait, you are not formed as other boys,
he a man of learnin'?
this is the same procedure we will be using when we collapse the tunnel after entering the casino vault and returning to the root cellar,
he was a self-educated man, Didn't have a career as such, but the government did recognize the breadth of his readin'
by makin' him librarian of the state nervous hospital in Meridian, where he was a distinguished inmate,
once these materials are combined only the professionals may handle them,
that means me or the General,
separately they are harmless, completely inert,
why, you could light this stuff on fire, hit it with a ham,
what in the name of heavens was that?
well, um, I'm quite certain there's absolutely no reason to be alarmed,
why, I'm not even absolutely certain I heard anything at all,
didn't hear nothin'?!
well, something perhaps,
nothing that need discompose us was the sense I was tryin' to convey,
now, Mrs, Munson, I will not have you missin' your musical recital, Off you go!
I shall call the gas company, or the water company,
whatever subterranean utility is implicated in this contretemps,
I shall see to the matter, as only a highly educated classicist could,
blood! Blood, Professor, blood! Blood, blood, blood!
it's nothin' to make a fuss about, It's perfectly all right,
jackass! You better get yo' ass back down there and find that shit, dipshit!
really, I'm perfectly all right, - Perfectly all right?
jackass, you just blew your goddamn finger off!
the muthafucka down there flappin' the fuck around!
you better get yo' ass back down there and find it!
I'm tellin' you right now, nubbie, I ain't pickin' up your goddamn finger!
I gather there was a premature detonation,
would you tell this muthafucka he can sew this shit back on?!
it's like that dude whose wife cut his dick off, threw it on the freeway?
she just called Triple A, they towed the dick and sewed the muthafucka back on!
listen up! Jackass, I saw the muthafucka in a porno!
the thang still worked! It looked like a chewed-up frank, but that little muthafucka be workin' that muthafucka!
it's mangly, but he be fuckin' the bitch all kind of ways with a twisted dick!
Oh! Your fuckin' finger just moved! The muthafucka movin' slow now!
I'm not gettin' that shit, Fuck that! You're on your own there!
they usin' the house to practice music, of the Rococo,
Mmm-hm,
I propose we get our fallen comrade to the hospital,
the General will follow when he manages to recover the severed digit,
no, no, really, I'm perfectly all right, I don't know what all the fuss is about, - Good news! Good news! - Pickles! Go get him!
the house is in apple-pie order, though we do have to get medical attention for Mr, Pancake, who, durin' the disturbance, pinched his finger in the valve of his sackbut,
you let the cat out!
Wha,? The General is even now exercisin' every effort in retrievin'
your mischievous little Pickles, Please, go on,
go on and enjoy the concert! Driver! Au revoir, mesdames, Despite our setback, we find ourselves on schedule to penetrate the vault here this afternoon, while Mrs, Munson is at church, havin' blasted that little old rock to pieces durin' Mrs, Munson's choir practice,
Garth, can you run us through the game plan for what remains of our tunnel?
of course, Why, it's child's play now, Easiest thing in the world,
only a couple of feet separate us from the vault,
just the usual spadework until we get to the masonry of the vault, and then we just drill through,
and will you be able to wield the drill with your maimed extremity?
Oh, well, yeah, I should think so, Yeah, it's, uh, it's only one finger,
inhibits me in doing finer work of course, I'll always have to live with that,
maybe - I'm just thinkin' out loud here
maybe, since as you say there will be problems later, maybe - and I actually mentioned this to Mountain Girl, she agrees with me, so it's not just one person's opinion - maybe, uh,
I should get a little extra compensation for the accident,
somewhat larger share,
why, if this was any other line of work, I'd be getting workman's comp,
wouldn't l? Might even have a pretty good lawsuit,
wait, so you gonna sue yourself for blowing your own goddamn finger off?
well, now that is simply asinine, - Yes, but you see, Garth, this is not what you just called "some other line of work,
Yeah, no, no, no, but if it were,
this is a criminal enterprise, not to put too fine a point on it, entailing any manner of risk not involved in honest labor,
governmental regulations and civic safeguards cannot be assumed to apply to antisocial pursuits, - Yeah, but he lost his finger, - We don't give a fuck!
that fool could blow his goddamn dick off, it don't make no nevermind to us!
we not payin' this jackass for goin' around blowin' off goddamn body parts!
get yo' fuckin' head out yo' ass, man!
look you, there is no call for,
no extra share!
OK, Majority rules,
like I say, it was just a trial balloon, Hand's not so bad really,
I even get some phantom feeling,
Yeah, you pull on your prick, you get some phantom feelin', - Fuck you, - Fuck you, - Fuck you! - Fuck you, nubbie!
well, now that that matter is settled, why don't we synchronize our watches before Gawain reports to work,
in 20 seconds, it will be exactly 12:16, - Fifteen, - What, it'll be 12:15?
no, 15 seconds, Well, 11 seconds now, lt'll be 12:16, - Eight, seven, - Professor? Prof,?
six, - Professor?
five, Yes, Lump!
I don't have a watch,
there'll be no more weepin' and wailin'
no more weepin' and wailin'
no more weepin' and wailin'

Ain'tthatsomethin'!
l, B,S, - You be what?
irritable Bowel Syndrome! Is there a men's room down here?
Oh, come on, You shouldn't be usin' the men's room now!
or a lady's room, Quickly, l, B,S,
if you knew you had the runs, why didn't you shit back at the house?
quickly!
we don't want Elron finding your stinkin' ass on the crapper!
no choice, It's a medical condition, Quickly!
you one disgustin' individual, you know that?
come on, Follow me,
I feel 30 pounds lighter, - Come the fuck on with your stinkass, - Thank you for being so understanding,
not everyone is, of course, which is why the biggest challenge of l, B,S, is educating the public,
afflicts over two million people, yet most of us have never heard of it,
and it strikes without regard to age, gender or race,
Oh, fuck, man, I don't wanna hear about this shit,
well, that's exactly the kind of attitude we're fighting,
I guess I never told you that's how Mountain Girl and I met,
they had an l, B,S, weekend at Grossinger's up in the Catskills,
of course, the tourist business there has suffered with the demise of the Borscht Belt, so they have various promotions, mixers, so on,
this was a weekend for lrritable Bowel singles to meet and support each other - and share stories, - Man, look here,
I don't want to hear a single one of them stories, OK?
now, some of them are very moving, - Not one fucking story!
look, I didn't choose to have l, B,S, - Man, shut the fuck up!
there's no cure, you know, Only control, Lifelong condition,
Yeah, you know what? Bein' an asshole's a lifelong condition, too,
just drop the fuckin' tools,
I'm not complaining, I did meet Mountain Girl,
man, get back in the fuckin' hole!
Oh! Marvel, Marvelous, Marv, This way! This way, gentlemen!
Oh! Excellent! Excellent, Flawless, flawless, Thumbs up,
can't stop shittin', Can't stop talkin' about shittin',
gentlemen, to we few, We who have shared each other's company, each other's cares, each other's joys, and who shall now reap the fruits of our communal efforts, shoulder to shoulder, from each according to his abilities, so forth and whatnot,
we have had our little differences along the way, but I'd like to think that they've only made us value one another all the more,
each of us coming to understand and appreciate the other's unique qualities and potencies and, yes, foibles,
I suggest that we shall look back upon this little caper one day, one distant day, grandchildren dandled upon our knee, and perhaps a tear will form and we shall say, "Well, with wit and grit and no small amount of courage, we accomplished something on that day, a feat of derring-do, an enterprise not ignoble,
we merry band, unbound by the constraints of society and the prejudices of the common ruck,
we happy few, - Gentlemen, to us! - To us!
charge shoulda gone off already,
I do beg your pardon?
the charge to collapse the tunnel, I set it for eight minutes,
well, that much time and more has certainly elapsed,
I need not remind you, it is of the essence of this plan that the money should appear to have simply vanished without a trace, - spirited away, as it were, by ghosts, - Of course,
the conundrum of the undisturbed, yet empty vault, the unsolvable riddle of the sealed yet violated sanctum, is of the utmost importance, not only to make our caper more intellectually satisfying, it is exigent as a matter of practical fact,
I remind you that if any tunnel is ever found leading to this house, the owner knows all your names,
you just fart?
Nope, nope, I'm fine, Perfectly all right! Not a problem!
there's no hole left,
professor!
I'm surprised!
well, uh, properly speaking, madam, we are surprised, You are taken aback,
though I do acknowledge that the sense that you intend is gaining increasing currency through its use, yes,
you have returned from your devotions betimes,
I had to make tea,
I want to talk to you, Professor, so don't you be leavin'!
and you! I told you I don't want any smokin' in this house!
Oh, come on in!
how you doin'?
tea, ladies,
now, I don't know what you boys been up to, but I know mischief when I see it, Now, I want an explanation, but first,
I want you to get your fannies up here with all y'all's period instruments,
now, I been tellin' the ladies about your music, and they want to hear you play, - Professor? - Yes, Lump?
I can't really play the buttsack,
madam, or rather, mesdames, you must accept our apologies for not bein' able to perform, for, as you see, we are shorthanded,
gawain is still at work, and we could no more play with one part tacit than a horse could canter shy one leg,
perhaps I could offer, as a poor but ready substitute, a brief poetic recital,
though I do not pretend to any great oratorical skills,
I would be happy to present, with your ladies' permission, verse from the unquiet mind of Mr, Edgar Allan Poe, "Ladies, thy beauty is to me"
like those Nicean barks of yore,
that gently, o'er a perfumed sea, The weary, wayworn wanderer bore to his own native shore.
- My, my, my, "On desperate seas long wont to roam,
thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
thy Naiad airs have brought me home
to the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome,
glory hallelujah, Amen!
Bye-bye, ladies, It was, it was my pleasure, - We have to do this again, - Yes, we do got to,
such a pleasure, Safe home, Safe home, - Now I want to know what's goin' on, - Oh, indeed, indeed,
the thirst for knowledge is a very commendable thing,
though I do believe that when you hear the explanation you shall laugh riotously, slappin' your knee and perhaps even wipin' away a giddy tear, relieved of your former concern,
lump here is an avid collector of lndian arrowheads, and having found one simply lying on your cellar floor
a particularly rare artifact of the Natchez tribe?
Nats, what?
he enlisted the entire ensemble in an all-out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others,
and apparently, in doing so, we hit a mother lode of natural gas,
I myself became acutely aware of the smell of "rotten eggs,"
and it was just at this inopportune moment that the General here violated the cardinal rule of this house - and lit himself a cigarette, - So sorry,
well, what about all that money?
Ah.
the money, Well, the money is Mr, Pancake's, - That's right, - Who only just remortgaged his home in order to raise the money for a surgical procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common-law wife, Mountain Water, who suffers from astigmia, strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly,
Mr, Pancake is an ardent foe of the Federal Reserve, and is, in fact, one of those eccentrics one often reads about hoardin' his entire life savings, in Mr, Pancake 's case, in a Hefty bag that is his constant companion, - The Steel Sak, - Don't trust the banks, Never have,
Mm-mn,
it don't smell right to me, - I'm callin' Sheriff Wyner, - No! Madam!
please, please, Madam!
no, no, I beg of, Yes! Yes!
it is a lie! It is a fantastic tale!
you have us dead to rights, but, madam, please, please, please allow me to tell you the truth in private,
madam,
madam, we are not musicians of the late Renaissance, - Nor of the early, nor mid period, - Mm-hm,
we are, in fact, criminals,
desperate men, Mrs, Munson,
we have tunneled into the nearby offices of the Bandit Queen gambling emporium - and relieved it of its treasure, - Lord have mercy,
it is true,
the Bandit Queen is a den of iniquity, a painted harlot luring people into sin by exciting the vice of greed with her promise of easy winnings, Oh, yes,
her gains are ill-gotten,
but, I offer no excuses - save one,
we men have each pledged one half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution,
in compensation for the use of your home, we had planned to donate a full share to Bob Jones University, without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same,
but now you have wrested the information from me,
there you have it, It is on your table, Mrs, Munson,
the "awful truth,
stolen money, - But find the victim, Mrs, Munson,
I challenge you, Even the casino itself, that riparian Gomorrah, shall suffer no harm,
it has an insurance company,
a financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults,
that is its function,
and that insurance company has tens and tens of thousands of policyholders,
so that, We have done the calculations, Mrs, Munson,
so that at the end of the day, at the final reckoning, each and every one of those policyholders shall have contributed one penny,
one, single, solitary cent to the satisfaction of this claim, - One penny? - One penny, Think of it, Mrs, Munson,
one penny from those thousands upon thousands of people so that Bob Jones University can continue on its mission,
why, I have no doubt that, were those policy holders made aware of the existence of that august institution, each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount for the furtherance of its aims,
well, that's prob'ly true,
sadly, the criminal stain is upon my soul, but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes as long, that is, as the secret stays with us,
well,
I can't hardly see the harm in it, - One penny? - One penny, - I'm sorry, - Excuse me?
no, I'm sorry, it's wrong, and don't you be leadin' me into temptation, - No, no, madam, I must strenuously, - I'm sorry, it's just plain wrong, - Stealin'! - No, madam, - I know your intentions was good, - No, they weren't!
and I won't call the police if you give back the money and y'all go to church with me next Sunday,
and engage in divine worship?!
I've made up my mind,
now, you can doubletalk all you want, It's church or the county jail,
think it over, I gotta feed the cat, - Motherfuck! - Yes,
unfortunately, Mrs, Munson has rather complicated the situation,
Yeah, well, I know how to decomplicate it,
you bust a cap in that old bitch's head, everything be simple,
not easy to do, Many reasons,
practical ones: Quiet neighborhood, sleepy town,
reasons of moral repugnance: A harmless woman, a deed conceived and executed in cold blood,
Oh, no, Gawain, would that it were simple,
well, fuck, man! What we gonna do? Give the money back and go to church?
I shudder, I quake,
you, sir, are a Buddhist,
is there not a "middle" way?
must float like a leaf on the river of life, , and kill old lady,
Yes, yes, I suppose you are right,
it is the active nature of the crime, though, that so abhors,
the squeezing of the trigger, the plunging of the knife,
but, let us think a moment,
what other tools do we have at hand?
we have the cellar,
we have the cavity,
we have masonry and trowel,
perhaps we could simply, immure her,
sure, Easiest thing in the world, I can whip up a little mortar in a snow saucer,
lay the bricks, Anchor in some chains,
mountain Girl could outsource the manacles,
Ah, gentlemen, gentlemen, we delude ourselves,
no, shortest and painless is best,
Gawain's gun, retort muffled by a pillow, into the brain, The affair of an instant,
the only question is who wields the weapon?
I believe it is traditional in such circumstances to draw straws,
fair enough, Here you go, Lump,
I'm thinkin', though, that since I lost a finger
and I mean literally lost it 'cause of that fuckin' cat
maybe I should be excused from this thing,
hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway,
you one whiny muthafucka,
I'll come over there and squeeze your fuckin' nutsack, you keep that bullshit up,
shut up, punk!
I'll kick your goddamn ass, sweet-legs! - Gentlemen!
no special pleading, No exceptions,
it is of the nature of the situation we would all prefer to be excused,
well, OK, it was just a trial balloon,
long straw, You all see it, All that fuss for nothin', punk,
fuck you,
Motherfuck!
Lord, I'm troubled
Lord, I'm troubled
Lord, I'm troubled Oh, Lord, by my soul
my Lord, but when I get up in the Kingdom, Lord
I won't be troubled no more - Oh, Lord, I'm troubled - Lord, I'm troubled
Lord, I'm troubled - Oh, would you like a hot cross bun? - No, just an explanation.
coming up!
Ouisie, I'll take some cocoa. - Hi, George.
what's goin ' on?
George! How did they get in here?!
what you got there, Gawain? - Why, nothin', Mama,
nothin', my ass! You got a dog there!
no, Mama, - A filthy, noisy little pest of a puppy dog - gonna shit all over the house! - He won't shit in the house, Mama,
I'm gonna train him, I promise, I'll train him real good!
I'm gonna train you real good!
you wait till your daddy get home, He gonna lay into you proper!
no, Mama! Please, Mama! I love you!
your daddy gonna kick yo' ass!
mama's whuppin' Gawain's ass!
ain't you gonna use the strap, Mama?
I love you, Mama, I'm sorry, Mama, I love you,
Yeah, I'll wipe the dog's ass and everything, Mama,
I'll train him to shit in the toilet, Mama, - I'll wipe his ass and everything, Mama, - What you doin'?
what you doin' with my pillow?
nothin', ma'am, I just came down to get a, - Ugh! - I'm displeased with you!
Yeah, but, - Fine colored boy like you - fallin' in with that trash downstairs! - Ugh!
now, I know your mama taught you better than that!
I can't do it, She remind me of my mama, - Look, man, - Why, this is most irregular, , y'all muthafuckas just gonna have to draw straws again,
wait a minute, You've got to accept your responsibilities, young man, and shoot that old lady,
Hey, man, fuck you and your irritated bowel!
must shoot,
now, look here, it's the easiest thing in the world,
just pretend her head's a casaba melon and the gun is a melon baller,
what the fuck are you talkin' about? A melon baller?
look, man, you do it, - Oh, this is most irregular,
now, look, with equal rights comes equal responsibility,
I'm afraid Mr, Pancake is correct, We cannot draw straws again,
the exercise would lose all credibility if you show the loser can simply beg off,
must shoot,
Hey, look, man, she's just an old colored lady to you,
come on, man, you do it, - Why, you sniveling little coward, - What did you say to me?
sniveling little coward, - You whiny muthafucka,
I will come up yo' stankin', irritated asshole with this gun and give you a lead colonic, muthafucka!
you think you scare me, you mewling punk?
you don't scare me, Bull Connor and all his dogs didn't scare me!
now, be a man,
you fuck! You ain't no fuckin' man!
Oh, my, this is most distressin', - Be a man!
you ain't no fuckin' man! Fuckin' a 60-year-old with pigtails!
why, you bastard punk! Mountain Girl is 53!
she could ride your ass to jelly! - Oh, yeah?!
gentlemen, please! - I seen Virginia hams
I'd rather stick my dick in than that big ol' white chick!
Oh, my God,
Oh, no,
Oh, my, - I think he's hit, - Oh, no,
I'll just check the carotid artery, - That's a negative, - Is he dead, Professor?
Oh, sure he's dead, Lump, I just checked his carotid artery, Well, this is most irregular,
we shall need a Hefty bag,
she is in the kitchen,
you steal out with the carcass while I dazzle her with conversation,
my dear Mrs, Munson, I have outlined your position with my colleagues, and I now return to you to render our collective verdict,
there was much spirited discussion and an atmosphere of frank give-and-take,
some of our number were initially appalled at your proposal that we simply return the money, Some were more receptive,
I don't care if they was receptive or not!
and that attitude, madam, was a factor in our discussions,
to a man, I must say they were devastated at the prospect of not being able to contribute to their respective charities, - Well, that is a shame, - lndeed, but at the end of the day, your position prevailed,
so we have decided to return the money, every last cent of it, and attend Sunday services, rather than spend the remainder of our days wastin' away at the Mississippi Men's Correctional Facility,
though that was the original preference of some,
you are not assistin' with the cadaver,
Oh, no need,
just chuck it off the bridge, Easiest thing in the world, - I'm just cleanin' up here,
Oh! That's them, Back already,
I'll just go dump these in the hearse,
Yeah, easiest thing in the world,
general!
no extra share, huh?
mountain? - Garth?
l, B,S, dear?
Oh, come
let us go back
to God - Go back to God - Oh, come on - Let's go back to God - Let us go back - Let's go back to God - Come on
let's go back to God
get Garth,
let us go back
to God
go back to God
excellent, I believe, at last, we have the right man for the job,
the old woman is a more formidable antagonist than one had imagined,
now, Lump, it falls to you to finish the job, - The comedy must end, - You know, - I've been doin' some thinkin', Professor, - Oh, dear,
maybe we should be goin' to church, Maybe she is right,
Ooh, dear, Lump, I feared those would be your words,
not that I don't appreciate you giving the matter the benefit of your thought, but recall, my dear boy, our respective functions in this enterprise,
I am a professor, The professor, as you yourself so often say, The thinker,
trained, in fact, in the arts of cogitation,
you, Lump, are the goon, the hooligan, the dumb brute, whose actions must be directed by a higher intelligence,
Yeah, I know, but,
Ah, ah, ah! No buts, dear boy, Do not repeat the error of thinkin',
now is the moment of praxis, Now, Lump, you must act,
well, I can't do it, Professor, A nice old lady like that,
think of the riches, Lump, that you and I alone shall divide,
Yeah, I know, but,
and reflect also that if you decline to act, thus forcin' me to do so, you shall no longer have any entitlement to the money,
your offices shall have been nugatory,
you mean you're gonna kill her?
of course, yes, My hand shall be forced,
I can't allow you to do that, Professor, You, -, allow? - Mm-hm,
not allow?
what presumption!
you stupid boy!
you very, very, extremely stupid boy,
Oh, yeah?
who looks stupid now?
no bullets?
perhaps it had to be thus, "Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche"
how statue-like I see thee stand,
a raven.
the agate lamp within thy hand!
Ah, Psyche, from the regions which
are Holy Land!
Ugh!
huh?
Uh-huh,
professor?
mm, mm, mm! Couldn't face the music,
I appreciate that, but we don't know what to do, Tried that, too,
Oh, - Uh, Mrs, Munson, - Gotta make a statement, Sheriff,
ma'am, could it possibly wait? We're kinda busy down here today,
Oh, well, I suppose it could wait, but it's about that casino money,
let me call you back, You know somethin' about it?
somethin'? Everything! I got it at home, - You got what at home? - The money! $1, 6 million dollars, - It's down in my root cellar, - How did it get there, Marva?
well, a bunch of desperate men stole it and put it there, that's how!
see, they was musicians of the Renaissance period, Turned out they really couldn't play, but they could recite poems that'd break your heart, - The ringleader spoke in dead tongues, - Does he now?
Oh, I tried to get you to see him, - That night, - Yes, ma'am,
I had to holler at 'em about stealin' all that money,
and I guess I made'emfeel real bad, 'cause they just picked up and left without takin' the money!
and they let Pickles out!
so you want us to come over and fetch him,
Oh, no, no, he's back,
what you want me to do with the money?
you keep it! Why don't you keep it?
keep it? - Go on and keep it, Miss Marva,
well,
it is just a penny off of everybody's policy, - Could,?
you don't suppose I could,? - Yes, ma'am?
could I just give it all to Bob Jones University?
Yeah, That'd be nice,
give it all to 'em! That's a good idea!
as long as everybody knows,
how you doin'?
pickles! Oh, Lord, Pickles!
shine on Oh, let it shine on
let it shine on
let your light from the lighthouse shine on me
shine on Oh, let it shine on
let your light from the lighthouse shine on
I know I've got religion and I ain 't ashamed to let
your light from the lighthouse shine on me
angels in the heaven done wrote my name
let your light from the lighthouse shine on
Oh, let it shine on
Oh, let it shine on
let your light from the lighthouse shine on me
sooner or later, a thug will tell his tale.
we all want to go on record.
so let's hear it for all the hoods.
the Jews out of Brownsville...
the blacks on Lenox Avenue, the ltalians from Mulberry Street...
the lrish in Hell's Kitchen. Like that.
meanwhile, Puerto Ricans been getting jammed since the '40s...
and ain't nobody said nothing.
well...
I'm gonna lay it on you one time, for the record.
my people.
they hit New York and filed into the roach stables...
in Spanish Harlem and the South Bronx.
they sat behind the sewing machines. Stood behind the steam tables.
and marched behind the brooms.
in other words, they busted their ass.
how did I survive growing up?
hustling, thieving, break-ins.
anything for dollars in theose days.
this here's the story of East Harlem.
blacks on one side, ltalians on the other...
and Puerto Ricans stuck right there in the middle.
and any way you cross the line...
[gun firing]
could get your ass killed.
[gun firing]
for 30 years...
italians, Puerto Ricans, and blacks...
all in a three-sided war.
no winners but the funeral parlors.
and then one day the ltalians showed up with the dope.
that's what made the peace, the heroin business.
[gun firing]
[Alarm buzzing]
I hit 21 in the Elmira Pen, upstate New York.
first whiff of country air for this Puerto Rican.
[People chattering]
there you are. Hey.
made you a little sampler there.
we're having osso buco, escarole and beans...
and rigatoni with lobster sauce. Take your pick.
Oh, it's better than my wife makes.
get divorced, maybe you can marry Rocco. I just may do that.
I'll make you a plate, what do you want? Whole nine yards.
now, this is historical.
a Puerto Rican, a brother, an ltalian...
all bunking together in the joint.
in your head, keep the number in your fuckin' head, Clyde.
there you go, baby.
Earl was the brains.
one of the top numbers guys in Harlem.
inside or out, nothing ever went down without discussing it with Earl.
Rocco had all the connections.
he was mobbed up with the Pleasant Avenue crew.
I'm doin' the best I can, Rocco, but...
Rocco didn't talk like no wise guy.
he spoke nice and soft. Dignified.
I gotta go all the way to New York City to buy you tomatoes?
I'd appreciate it if you would.
[thunder rumbling]
we're all getting out of here soon, Carlito. I miss it already.
time to stop all your bullshit.
what bullshit?
rippin' off cars, sellin' reefer. Time to get your act together.
the last time I checked, we was all doing time.
me and Rocco, we businessmen. You?
small-time street hood, baby.
[rain pattering]
want to start making some real money, Charlie?
like, who don't?
heroin's taken over.
my people, they have a very dependable supply line.
but the ltalians, see...
they ain't going to 125th Street to deal with the brothers...
and they ain't going west to deal with the Puerto Ricans.
they need distributors in those neighborhoods.
guys with heart.
guys with brains. Standup motherfuckers.
you can be a part of this, Charlie...
or you can keep hustling quarters the rest of your life.
think about it.
and that's how three cats from different alleys got together.
me, Earl, and Rocco.
we hit Harlem like Frazier hit Ali.
Artie's really looking forward to meeting you guys.
Artie.
I'd like to introduce you to my friends. This is Carlito, this is Earl.
Artie, these are the guys I was telling you about
I gotta meet people when I'm dining out, huh?
a fucking Puerto Rican...
and a nigger?
come on. Get 'em out of here.
you got something wrong with your ears? Take a fucking walk.
gentlemen.
Charlie.
I say we go jam steak knives up their noses.
no, no. It's Rocco's boss.
it went good. He likes you guys.
he's giving us 10 kilos on consignment.
we're in business.
we got one rule: People get used to this kind of quality.
don't go waving your magic wand turning 5 keys into 15...
stepping all over our shit with baby laxative.
you dig it?
me and my pop, we got a rule, too:
any of you guys fuck up, you're all dead.
[men chattering in Spanish]
big Jeff and Little Jeff...
was the two most feared cops in all of Harlem.
Hey, where is everybody going?

[men muttering] leave the cash, leave the clothes...
Ieave the city.
[Groaning]
[bone grinding]

What're you doing hanging out in front of this building? You live here?

angel Rodriguez, 2670 East 117th.
this piece of shit threw a 75-year-old lady in front of the 6 Train.
we come back here tomorrow, you better know where he is...
or you gonna get tossed in front of the 6 Train.
rule one:
touch the dope...
get buried in a hole.
guys who get high are gonna get sloppy, gonna get popped...
gonna start scratching and talking.
rule two: Nobody settles their own beef.
you bring it to me or Carlito.
we'll tell you what's what.
rule three: You gonna make a pickup or a drop with somebody you don't know...
they gotta have the other half of the bill.
same serial number. Or nothing goes down.
[Door opening]
[Door closing]
it's a long line for haircuts today.
any of you seen this scumbag?
What'd he do?
snatched a bag off somebody's grandmother...
and tossed her in front of a subway train.
that's Junior.
you can catch him at the Edmonds Hotel on 118th.
he's got a girl over there.
Thanks, fellas. Don't mention it.
how long you been out, Carlito? Couple of months.
looks like you trying real hard to keep it that way.
you know it.
[cursing]
Hollywood Nicky owned West Harlem.
it belonged to him outright.
everything from Lenox Avenue to the Hudson River.
Nicky got the name "Hollywood..."
cause you could always find him at the fights, movie premieres...
Broadway shows.
had more broads chasing him than the Beatles.
lived on the entire floor of a Park Avenue hotel.
how the fuck could you be eating again? I got hungry again.
this is the third time.
I got low blood sugar. Doctor says I'm supposed to eat a lot of small meals.
motherfucker, you ain't had a small meal in your life.
it's 10: 30 in the morning, you already on fucking dinner.
no wonder my car smells like a garbage pail.
and I keep finding your shit up underneath my seats.
I don't put nothing under the seats.

you making me carsick and we ain't even moving.
nigger, it's the biggest fight of the year.
if you want me to, I'll fly through Chicago and I'll pick you up.
Hollywood Airlines, baby.
Nicky says...
as far as he's concerned, we stay east of Lenox...
ain't gonna be no problems.
Earl did the smart thing.
cause you don't never want no beef with Hollywood Nicky.
before he went all Hollywood, they used to call him Nicky X-ray.
see right through brick walls, round corners.
I know you been playing games.
little pinch for your head out of my parcel...
couple of dollars now and then.
get the fuck out of here.

you wasn't thinking.

like I told you, I'm gonna be running this spot in a few years.
so why don't you finish that drink...
[Door opening] so we go on back to my place?
[soul music playing]
[Woman gasping]
do you know what this is?
do you know what this is?
chump change.
but it belongs to me.
I don't care if it's $1 million.
I don't care if it's $100.
I don't care if it's $20!
when you take something that's mine...
you spit in my face.
and it hurts me.
what's the first rule in life?
what's the first rule in life, above all others?
what is the first commandment the Lord God gave us?
don't mess with Hoppy.
just don't mess with him.
may I please have a cream soda?
don't mess with Hoppy.
you got that right.
dope. The great equalizer.
puts millionaire stockbrokers and welfare mothers front row in the gutter.
we didn't create all these tecatos.
I never put a needle in nobody's arm.
heroin already unpacked and moved in, Jack, long before I showed up.
[People chattering]
me, Rocco, and Earl. We was the new musketeers.
every night, different joint, different women...
different scene.
you gonna call me a liar? I didn't call you a liar, sir.
I simply reminded you that I pointed the stain out...
on the lady's coat when you came and checked it. Man, you showed me shit.
right, I want a new coat. It was my birthday present.
excuse me. Do you mind?
feels like old paint. You might just want to trim a little of the fur off.
what are you, a dry cleaner? Get the fuck out of my face.
look, I want to talk to the manager.
all right, good. You talk to the manager. Victor, can you please get Felix?
you paying for this coat.
can you read English?
read the sign. It says, "Not responsible for personal property."
so no one's paying for your coat.
listen, this coat right here...
cost more than you gonna make in your whole fucking life, you dumb puta cunt.
[Groaning]
I'm Carlito Brigante. You ever heard of me?
[Panting]

so you can go get with the coat-check girl?
you can trust me, man. Tell me. It's okay, I'll do it.
she's looking fine tonight.
well, hello there.
I was in the neighborhood, I figured I'd drop by...
and make sure the coat got to you all right.
it did.
and let me tell you, it was the most beautiful coat I have ever seen in my life.
and I seen a lot of coats.
now make sure that you don't lose this...
because you're gonna need it to get your coat back.
Hey, Leticia, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
offend me? Don't be silly. You checked a coat.
I'm a coat-check girl. It was a gift, all right?
let me just give you a ride home. I like to take the train.
no, tonight you getting a ride. No, thank you.
why not?
look, Carlito, we're different kinds of people, okay?
what do you mean?
I mean, you can't just buy somebody with a leopard coat.
all right? We don't even know each other.
come on, it's cold out here. Let me just give you a ride home.
I said no.
[salsa music playing on stereo]
[stereo stops playing]
so, what do you do, Carlito? Besides buy coats for people that you don't even know.
I'm a booker. A bookie?
no, booker.
I book musicians. You know, guys like Tito Puente, Ray Barretto...
Machito. Everybody. All over the country.
I'm a solid citizen, Leticia.
so you gonna go to dinner with me on your next night off?
no.
I'm taking you to this fantastic joint. They got the best steaks.
oysters like this, great desserts. You're gonna love it.
what part of the word "no" do you not understand?
right here is fine.
is this where you live?
no. I'm back down the block. But I'm gonna get out here.
I live with my family. They don't need to see me...
get out of a strange man's car.
nobody gonna be awake right now. Carlito, please.
I'm only letting you out here if you have dinner with me.
otherwise I'm coming into the house. I'm gonna wake everybody up...
introduce myself, maybe make some coffee.
I'm off Thursday.
I'll meet you at this restaurant of yours.
but it's all the way downtown. So why don't we meet at a bar up here?
the Old Timer's on 104th.
I'll be there at 8: 00. May I go now?
wear the coat.
it's my gift to you whether we go out a few times, get married and have kids...
or never see each other again.
good night, Carlito. Good night.
[salsa music playing on radio]
excuse me.
I'm looking for Carlito.
he called and said he'd be here soon.
thank you.
Oye, viejo.
that broad just asked for Carlito Brigante?
Si.
[Speaking Spanish]
that's a beautiful coat you got. That shit look like zebra.
[Screaming]
what are you doing? Get off me!
get off. Stop it! It's my coat.
tell your boyfriend, Carlito, that Manny and Chucho want to talk to him tonight.
right here. 2: 00.
and if you ever want to see this coat again, Carlito better show up, alone.
Vamos, Chucho.
you okay? I'm fine.
[sighing]
I don't know what that whole thing was about, all right?
probably some old musicians' union beef or something.
come on, Carlito. What's your deal, huh? What do you do?
I'm a booker. I book musicians. I tour with them.
you know, guys like Machito and Tito.
please, Tito Puente? Come on, you probably make more money than Tito Puente.
look at you, jodedor. Gangster.
you're not my type, Carlito. You're not my type at all.
what's your type?
janitor, busboy? Maybe a delivery boy or a dishwasher?
there ain't a whole lot out there for us, Leticia.
look, I never had no father.
my moms died when I was 12.
so I grew up in the youth home.
but you know what? That don't matter.
because I got my dignity, my pride.
whatever it is I do right now ain't gonna be forever.
what do you want from me, Carlito? Other than a fuck?
I like you.
I like that you were standing up to that guy the other night.
the way I see it, if I hadn't stepped in...
you might've really took him apart.
and I think that a tough, standup chick like you...
ought to be with a standup dude.
come on, I've known you, what, three days...
and I'm already in two beefs over fur coats about you?
come on, we got a connection.
[Car door closing]
good evening, Mr. Brigante. How you doing?
am I dressed up enough for this place?
of course you are, you kidding?
and after dinner I'm gonna go pick up your coat.
so, what brings you girls to el barrio?
we hitched down from Woodstock for the war demonstration.
what war? Vietnam.
Oh, yeah. I heard about that shit. That shit over east.
[Speaking Spanish]
Carlito! What's happening, baby? How you been?
I know, I know. You hot about the coat. I apologize.
but I had to get your attention somehow.
you don't remember me?
bro, Manny Sanchez, from the youth home.
I ain't seen you in what, 10 fucking years?
you look good, baby. This my cousin Chucho from Jersey.
how you doing, Carlito? Man, shut up.
[Speaking Spanish]
we got your coat right here.
before you take off with it...
just have a drink with us?
that's all you wanted? A fucking drink?
a drink with you is big time these days.
[Speaking Spanish]
leave the fucking bottle.
here's the deal, Carlito.
you got this whole organization, right?
but while you was in the joint...
me and Chucho here, we had our own distribution thing going.
you put us out of business.
Hey, this is America, right?
can't be getting in the way of no progress. I understand.
what do you want from me?
we want to work for you.
we're earners. We got cojones.
we're loyal, standup motherfuckers.
you can trust us, Carlito.
talk to my associates, and I'll get back to you.
Hey, Carlito.
you're all right.
it's a good thing for us he didn't come in shooting, huh?
didn't want to get no blood on the coat.
[women shrieking]
[women sobbing]
Shh.
you out of your fucking mind?
you smoked two fools in a bar full of witnesses.
it's a double murder, Charlie. Big collar. Promotion.
no statute of limitations.
Hey, it had to be.
they slapped my chick around, stole her coat.
if I don't kill them for that, how's it gonna look?
there are 30 other ways...
you could've skinned these cats.
see, we take care of things like this quietly.
you're in a business here, Charlie.
macho shit of yours.
it ain't gonna fly with what we got here.
Hey, you fellas want me out? I'm out.
no hard feelings.
shit, I was happy stealing cars.
lot less fucking headaches, that's for sure.
I'll put some guys out, see if they can't do a little witness control...
before the cops land on everybody.
I appreciate it, Rocco.
you ain't a street hood no more. You a businessman.
you gotta start thinking like one.
you can't get your hands dirty ever again.
if you do, it's over with us.
Hey, Rocco, you forgot to tell me I needed a corkscrew.
[Doorbell ringing]
it's open!
she's here.
can't I just dig it out with a knife...
or hammer it in there or something?
take a deep breath and suck it out.
and go buy yourself a corkscrew.
you know, fuck you. You're a real big help, Rocco.
[Music playing on stereo]
hello. Hi.
how you doing, Leticia? Good.
wow, you have a beautiful place.
thank you, you know, I try.
Oh, my God, you really do cook.
I told you, I'm practically a gourmet chef.
you know, I worked in class "A" joints as a kid.
Sauté, soufflé, over easy, double-boil. I can do all that stuff.
wow, I'm so impressed.
[Laughing]
you didn't make any of this.
what are you talking about?
everything is in the wrong pots. The stove is ice-cold.
well, the stove is broken.
so I had to go over to my neighbor's house and use his.
you're lying to me again.
what are you doing? What is this?
what is this? And this? It's from
lies. Lies. Lies.
you're a professional liar, huh? No, I just, you know...
Yeah, I think you are. You're a liar.
malo.
you don't wanna know.
we got mixed company, trust me. We wanna know, really.
all right.
making love with a skinny woman...
that's like having sex with a pair of elbows.
[grunting]
you need cushion for the pushin'!
early-bird Earl don't want your worm.
I want the whole damn apple, baby. And you might have it.
we need to talk.
you ladies mind excusing us?
I told him. I told him, "lf you start..."
now, we agreed you gonna stay east of Lenox Avenue.
now, my people are telling me you got your boys all over Fifth.
that would be east. It's too close.
I'm losing money.
move all your guys to Madison.
I want the whole area between Madison and Lenox empty.
that's not really the deal we made. We?
I ain't make shit with you, motherfucker.
brother...
relax.
you come in next week, we'll work something out.
first of all, I ain't your motherfucking brother.
and there ain't gonna be no next week unless we work this shit out now. Right now.
Nicky...
you don't think it's a little out of line you rolling in here like this...
while we're out with our ladies?
and now what, you wanna start making threats?
who the fuck do you think you talking to?
threats, I'll show you threats.
forget it. Forget it, Earl.
what's the difference, man? We gonna move all our guys to Madison.
now hold the fuck up.
you making decisions for me and Rocco now? We work for you?
Nicky, just give me a minute, all right?
one minute.
I'll tell you what the fuck is right.
what's right is what we all three agree on together. Now, you know that.
I agree. But that kind of macho shit don't fly with what we got here.
we can't go to war with this guy.
finished our little meeting?
Yeah, we cool.
we cool.
all right.
6: 30 at night and you ain't left the house yet?
what you got on, boy? You look like you pump gas for a living.
I gave you money for clothes, didn't l?
[Doorbell buzzing] You went and spent it on liquor and chicks, right?
you give this shit out on the streets? That's what you do?
anybody home? We're back here, man.
this what you're doing?
check it out, Carlito.
mama don't want Revolutionary Reggie in her home no more.
so now I'm stuck with his dusty ass.
I'll get my own place. Yeah, with what?
[Laughs]
lend me some money, big bro. You got enough.
yesterday I asked him to run some number slips for Clyde.
where are the number slips, huh? Where are the number slips, Reggie?
still with Clyde? Still with Clyde.
now that's an easy fucking job.
I mean, motherfuckers lined up for that job.
then let one of them do it.
I've had my spot in Barbados over a year now.
ain't been there but one time.
we work hard, Earl.
I'm getting out the dope business, Carlito.
got a kid on the way. Getting married.
Yeah, motherfucker.
things gonna be different now. Come on, Hollywood Nicky got 20 kids.
houses in Europe, Hawaii. That ain't me.
governor Rockefeller, he putting some new laws on the books.
gonna come down heavy on dope.
ain't gonna be no five, out in three for good behavior.
gonna be 25, 35, life.
we made plenty of money doing this shit, Carlito.
it's time we get out.
man, I tried other things.
I mean, junk's the only thing that ever worked for me.
what about my policy business?
numbers? Yeah.
shit, I could never deal with them digits every day. I'll teach you.
runners robbing you. Bookkeeping.
that shit's for accountants, motherfuckers like you. It's safe. That's what it is.
listen...
do me a favor with Reggie.
spend a little time with him. He ain't listening to me. I'm his brother.
you hang out with him, become his friend, maybe something rubs off.
teach him how to dress right, you know...
command some respect.
maybe then he can work with me. Take over.
motherfucker.
you gonna move to Barbados.
you do something for me with Reggie.
he's a fuckup, but he's a smart kid. He just needs direction.
and he ain't taking it from his brother.
I ain't see no black folk working in here.
I was wondering if we was allowed to shop here.
you are here.
this the first time you ever fit a black man for a suit?
cool threads, Carlito. Don't know what to say.
how about "thanks"? Yeah...
but you didn't work for the bread you paid for all this.
sucked it out of some poor motherfucker's arm.
[sighing]
you two, Earl...
you're all the fucking same.
social parasites...
with no awareness of the changes taking place.
see, minorities trying to catch up and you motherfuckers going around...
hustling your own people.
there ain't gonna be no hustlers when the revolution comes.
revolution.
they all gonna get lined up against the wall...
with all the other oppressors.
oppressors.
[Laughing]
you ain't had an oppressed day in your life, Reggie.
Earl's numbers sent you to private school, a year of college.
you got food, clothes. Look at this. Moms owns a two-family house.
don't go badmouthing your brother.
you been sucking his titty your whole life.
Carlito, I would like you to meet my mother.
[Speaking Spanish]
my sister-in-law, Angelita.
pleasure to meet you.
this is my father, and my brother, Sigfredo.
Mmm.
this food is fantastic. Best dinner I've had in...I don't know, my whole life.
[laughing]Gracias.
Oye, Carlito...
how is your business with the musicians? Long hours?
we stay out late, that's for sure.
and a guy like Machito, he don't like going home after the show.
so you got to entertain him till like 6: 00 in the morning.
Machito? Machito?
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cruz. Next time Machito's at the Palladium...
I'm getting you all your own table right next to the stage. My guests.
that would be my husband's dream.
thank you.
don't thank me. I'm gonna make you...
take out Machito all night after the show.
like that, I can go home and get some sleep.
Oye, Leticia, what I tell you? One day you gonna meet the right kind of man.
salut.
you know, I never get to shop in the neighborhood no more.
your pops always had that wheelchair?
he was in a car accident two years ago.
how long everybody live here?
ever since the accident.
I had to leave college to run the business.
you know...
my friend, Rocco...
he's like my brother.
his family owns a whole string of buildings over on Second.
he can probably set your folks up...
with like a nice two or three-bedroom for next to nothing.
matter of fact, it would be nothing.
you'd still be right near the bodega.
we get by just fine without handouts.
Sigfredo...
you got five people in two rooms with one toilet.
that ain't no handout. It'd be a favor.
Rocco owes me.
besides, maybe you can do something for me someday.
Yeah, like what? Take out Machito?
or cook dinner for Tito Puente? Huh?
I know who you are, Carlito Brigante.
Droguero.
you think you own this neighborhood.
and that all the hard-working people, they belong to you, but no.
all you own is the junkies.
you got it all wrong, Sigfredo.
people like you are the reason why everyone thinks...
that Puerto Ricans are a race of criminals.
all I'm trying to do is help you out, Sigfredo.
then I want you to go in the back and take a look at my sister.
cause she comes from a good family.
then I want you to leave and you'll never see her again. You understand me?
Yeah, well, unless you got some proof that says Leticia's a minor...
I'm gonna keep on seeing her. No, you will not.
besides your pops digs me.
who knows? Maybe he wants a successful son in the family.
[Speaking Spanish]
you get out of here, you hear me? You stay away from my sister.
you stay away from my family! You understand me?
Fredo, qué paso?
you stay away from him. You understand?
he's the devil.
I kept it going with Leticia. But quiet.
too bad I ain't the marrying kind.
I'd have loved to see Leticia's brother moping around the wedding...
with half the gangsters in New York making toasts to me.
you don't have to keep working at Saso's joint anymore checking coats.
I'll take care of you. Carlito, I take care of myself.
[Music playing]
Mmm-mmm-mmm!
[Laughing]
compliments of Mr. Bottolota. Thank you.
you are beautiful.
Yes.
[Laughing] You want a black man to fuck you, baby?
I got $300...
if you fuck me, baby. Come on, what's up?
you better straighten this kid out, Carlito.
brother can't get no action in here? What kind of shit is that?
you can't be banging broads at the table, Reggie.
I know they got a backroom.
Yeah. But you got to play it cool. Joint's got a liquor license.
anybody around here could be a cop.
listen...
Iittle while, we'll talk to the manager, slip him some cash...
and you go downstairs and have a good time.
Hey, Artie. Hey, Carlito. how are you doing?
thanks for the drink. You kidding me?
we ain't seen this much money since Prohibition.
you know, in that case I was thinking maybe...
I could be the first Puerto Rican made guy.
Hey, you never know.
Hey, Artie, this is Earl's kid brother, Reggie. Nice to meet you.
Earl's done good by us. Real good.
Earl was doing fine without you.
Carlito, you don't train your pet nigger before you let him out of the house?
why don't you go fuck your dead mother?
Artie.
fuck.
motherfucker!
[grunting]
Hey, tough guy Reggie, you're a big shot.
[People clamoring]
take it easy. Relax.
I'll kill you, you nigger. I'll fucking kill you.
please, everybody, just calm down. Please, relax. Calm down.
can I get somebody in here to help with this here?
relax. Just relax. Relax.
ladies, keep dancing. Smiles, ladies, smiles.
let me just clean this up. Can I have someone in here, please?
I'll help you. Just one minute. That's fine.
[Panting]
Hey, Jerry.
listen, do me a favor.
send a dozen bottles of the best champagne over to Artie's table.
let me have the whole check.
also, see if you can get ahold of Rocco...
tell him to get his ass over here. It's an emergency.
you got it, Carlito. Thank you.
[inaudible]
fuck me.
come here, baby. Reggie gonna show you something.
drop dead.
let's get the fuck out of here. Reggie.
being here is the only reason why you're not full of bullet holes.
we're gonna wait for Artie and his boys to split.
we're gonna make a move out the back.
that could take an hour, two hours, or three fucking days.
but we ain't moving from this spot till they gone.
you got to take a leak, do it in that fucking glass.
I got a piece right in my sock...
waste all them guinea motherfuckers.
Hey, Reggie, your brother, me, and Rocco...
we're in business with those guys. Deep.
you were way out of line.
motherfucker called me a nigger and I'm out of line?
you wouldn't shake the man's hand, Reggie.
he sends champagne, comes over to your table...
you treat him like a fucking hump.
for 30 years, man, we've been at war in Harlem...
blacks, Ricans and ltalians.
so here, me, Rocco, and Earl put something together...
and you want to mess it all up? That ain't right.
what do you think you doing?
putting up schools and nursing homes?
you motherfuckers are heroin dealers.
Reggie, time to make a move.
come on. All right, all right.
where are we going? Yo, go back and get that chick.
[Laughing]
Oh, lookie who's here!
Carlito, you buy us all those drinks.
you ain't got to leave out the back door.
Reggie fucked up, all right. I apologize.
you ain't got to answer to us. He does.
what are you doing? Get the fuck off.
what do we got here? Little black motherfucker.
we're gonna let you go, Carlito. But first you gonna watch this.
Artie, that's Earl's brother, Artie.
well, Earl's brother just said his last words.
cause I'm gonna cut his fucking tongue out. You can't do that, Artie.
open his mouth.
[Groaning]
Artie! Fuck my mother?
huh?
you spit in my face?
who the fuck are you?
[Screaming]
Artie!
[Car tires screeching]
[Car door closing]Artie! Wait!
[Reggie panting]
let him go. All right, he's a piece of shit, but let us take care of him.
look, you know how much money we're gonna lose without Earl?
don't wreck our business over this.
you better fucking take care of this, Rocco. You understand me?
you better fucking take care of this.
let's go.
[men mumbling]
[Reggie coughing]
[Panting]
he just went at it with Artie. Over nothing.
[siren wailing]
they would've killed him.
who am I gonna leave my policy business to?
Clyde's your copilot.
Clyde ain't family. Yeah, who is?
you two family. Charlie doesn't want it.
you give it to me, Artie gets involved.
you'll never see another nickel.
Clyde's all right, man.
I want to propose a toast to my successor, Clyde.
I've been in business with this man for 12 years...
he took over, and now he fired my ass.
cause you come to work late every day.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
and I want to propose another toast...
to my brothers of other colors, from other mothers...
my two best friends in the whole world...
Rocco, Carlito...
I love you and I'm gonna miss you.
[People clapping]I'm gonna miss all of you guys.
we're gonna have the wedding right there on the beach.
you two are coming, right? Like we have a choice.
fuck you, man. No, I want you to stay for a while.
it's a whole different vibe, man. I mean, slow, cool.
it's like, peaceful.
forget about it, Earl.
they're sending motherfuckers to the moon.
you don't think they can lock you two up?
Earl, we love you.
but we're not moving to the West lndies with you.
I'll see you on Christmas.
so, what time is your flight? 6: 30.
come on, man, one last drink.
me and the lady gonna stop for breakfast before we get on the flight.
breakfast? You just had dinner.
catch you at the beach, man.
Rocco.
get out of here, man.
[Car engine starting]
what do you think?
if you was me, would you throw in the towel...
and follow Earl down to paradise?
Yes. And I would take me with you.
I'd take you, too.
can't a man have a quiet drink in this motherfucker without you pushing a mop in his face?
fuck!
Charlie, if you don't mind, we'll drop Leticia off at home...
you can get Reggie out of here.
you got it.
now that Earl's gone, you make sure we never see him again.
you know, ain't got nobody to blame but yourself that Earl passed you up.
you could've had the whole policy bank...
but you just wouldn't straighten your ass out.
fuck Earl and fuck you!
y'all ain't nothing but Rocco's niggers.
know what, Reggie? Walk your ass home.
it's freezing out here, man.
hop the bus.
you hung around close to a year, you ain't learned shit...
you made no friends, no contacts.
all you do is go to black pride meetings, drink all night, and chase whores.
last time I checked, Malcolm X was a Muslim scholar.
no pork, no booze, no pussy.
prayed five times a day and wore a bow tie.
you don't know nothing about me
a punk is a fucking punk, Reggie...
black, white, Puerto Rican or Chinese.
the only reason why you're allowed to walk the streets is your brother.
he's gone now.
so you better go home, lock yourself in, and stay there.
I'm gonna tune you up one day, Carlito.
one day? Why wait, motherfucker?
if you're gonna make a move, make a move right now.
walk, Reggie.
cause next time I see you, it's gonna be bad.
[Car door opening]
[Car door closing]
[Car engine starting]
come on, Eddie. You can't shut down early on me.
it's 5: 30 in the morning, Carlito.
where you gotta go? Your wife can't stand your ass.
Yeah, yeah. Come on, have a drink with me. I'm buying.
why do you always do this to me, Carlito?
come on, Eddie. You know how much I love you.
when I die, I'm gonna leave you everything.
[gun firing]
[Groaning]
[gasping]
I warned you to stay away from my sister, Carlito.
all right? I warned you.
Oh, shit. Carlito!
somebody shot Carlito.
[respirator whistling]
[clanking]
we were successful in removing both bullets.
Mr. Brigante was lucky. No vital organs were damaged.
listen, Doc, if you need any more of my blood, I'm ready.
we're okay.
[Laughs]
can I talk to you for a second?
it's probably not a good idea for you to be here. All right?
I'll call you when Charlie wants to see you.
[sobbing]
private room. Not too shabby.
[whistling]
you must have 99 lives.
what can I do for you gentlemen?
tell you the truth...
we came by to see if there's anything we could do for you.
maybe let you flip through some mug shots.
I didn't even see the guy.
snuck up from behind me. Next thing I know, bang-bang.
must have been after my wallet.
we figured your goombah pals might have been getting sick and tired of whacking up all those dividends.
[sighing]
we're gonna make a little deal with you, Carlito.
you give us Artie Bottolota, his son...
your little buddy Rocco, and the rest of the Pleasant Avenue crew...
and we won't start breaking your balls on a daily basis.
you got nothing to break my balls about.
I'm in the music business, fellas.
Carlito Brigante is a taxpaying citizen just like everybody else.
every jackass in East Harlem...
is stumbling around trying to suck his own dick...
on account of what you and your pals are putting on the street.
now, for old times' sake...
we gonna let you grab your little piggy bank and fly away somewhere.
but you are gonna hand us everybody.
otherwise, you're going down with them.
feel better.
Hey, Carlito, you mind if I bring these home for my wife?
it's our anniversary. Knock yourself out.
[Mrs. Diaz speaking Spanish]
Carlito, please!
I beg you. Nobody is gonna get hurt.
Carlito. It's all right.
you know, if you had a brain in your head...
you would've took off and gone back to Puerto Rico already.
some hotshot off the street gonna come in here...
think he doing me a favor and light this joint up.
everybody gotta split town.
buy the ticket. Catch that plane, and never come back.
otherwise your parents gonna be using that money for your funeral.
[siren wailing]
I'm staying here, Carlito. No.
you're going with them.
you got to take care of your pops. No.
in a while we get back together. No.
you have to go, all right?
it's not safe for you here.
every day, I want you to remember one thing:
you still alive 'cause of me.
you call and let me have your address when you get settled.
I'll come down and see you.
do you promise?
of course.
[sobbing]I love you, Carlito.
I love you, too.
[sighing]
no, Leticia.
no, Leticia, no!
[crying]
[Speaking Spanish]
[Screaming]
get in the trunk, you fat fuck.
Hey, I got a gun on you, motherfucker. All right.
what the fuck
[Groaning]
[All grunting]
Hey, Artie, take a look at this.
[Grunts]
[Panting]
Artie, you forgot to take out the goddamn garbage. Artie.
Hey, hey!
what the fuck are you doing? Get off him!
Hey! Artie. Artie! Artie!
[trunk slamming]
[Car engine starting]
[tires screeching]
[Doorbell ringing]
anything new?
how do we know it was Reggie?
Artie's wife said three black guys snatched him.
that don't mean nothing.
I listened in on the ransom call. It was him.
anybody besides you figure that out?
when Artie comes home they will.
[Scoffs]
maybe we get lucky, Reggie buries him in a fucking ditch.
[Clears throat]
how you doing, Artie?
we paid the money. $2 million cash...
over an hour ago.
I made the drop. No tail. No stakeout.
we did exactly what they said.
you think they'd kill my son?
no, no, Artie. Why would they do that?
[clock ticking]
[sighing]
[Phone ringing]
hello.
we finished counting all the cash.
good. I wanted you to have it with no problems.
it's $20 short.
huh?
so fuck you very much.
I'm killing this guinea cocksucker.
wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[gun firing]
[SCREAMS]
wait! What happened?
[Woman crying]
[Laughing]
[grunting]
[Panting]
april fools', motherfucker.
[sobbing]
I don't know if I can do this funeral without a body.
you need a body? I'll get you a body.
[banging on door]
[Woman sniffling]
Artie boy.
[exclaims]
[Laughing]
[All laughing]
you guys must have prayed hard for us.
I never thought I'd live to see old man Bottolota throw a hug around this Puerto Rican.
it was about two minutes before the other shoe came crashing down like a safe.
you motherfuckers was in on it.
Artie, Charlie wouldn't be here if that were true.
you shut your mouth, Rocco!
if we was in on it...
we would have had Reggie kill you, don't you think?
they left me there to suffocate in that fucking trunk!
if the cops didn't drive by, I'd still be in there turning fucking blue!
enough!
maybe you was in on it, maybe you wasn't.
but Rocco brought you around us...
and then the both of you brought those fucking niggers around.
so you're responsible.
I'm putting Nacho Reyes on you.
worked with me in Cuba. Did more hits than all my guys together.
I'm giving him contracts on you, Rocco, and Earl.
and the only way they're gonna be canceled is...
if I find three dead niggers on my doorstep.
and my $2 million back in my pocket.
[speaks Spanish]
[Music playing on radio]
[sighing]
how is the food in this joint?
this is a bar. They don't got food here.
I'm talking to you, pendejo?
I'm fucking talking to you?
[inhaling]
[snorting]
Carlito.
I got a contract to kill you.
I don't want to do that.
so we...
we gonna go, we gonna find those three fucking cocolo, okay?
[Speaking Spanish]
nacho Reyes.
first-degree stone killer from them old Batistá days.
nacho got himself a bad blow habit.
he only worked two hours a day.
nacho, I don't want them in the car.
rest of the time it's all party and poontang.
man, you think I cover for that crazy fucking kid?
him come for me next.
Reggie was asked to leave our organization months ago.
he wanted to bomb police stations.
that's not what this movement's about.
we're about spreading progressive education for the uninformed...
not resorting to methods of violence. Why don't you come inside
come on, come on. Let's go have a fucking drink already.
at the rate we're going...
Reggie and his boys gonna die of old age.
and me and Rocco a lot sooner.
don't touch the car, please.
don't touch me. Don't be touching my shit.
Nicky, I'd never bother you with something like this...
but if we don't find them cats soon...
them crazy-ass ltalians are gonna come over...
and start shooting up the black side of Harlem.
[Laughs]
Carlito.
you don't find the motherfuckers that snatched Artie's kid...
you the one that's getting shot up.
Yeah, well that, too.
and far as them ltalians coming my way...
if one of them even set foot across Lenox Avenue...
next time you're gonna see a live guinea again...
is on the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
now I believe I've been very nice about this situation.
I let you and them set up across town from me.
I appreciate that.
because one day you and them wal-yos, you're gonna run out of dope.
and all them junkie motherfuckers you all done raised...
gonna come scurrying over to me...
Iike a bunch of starved cockroaches.
if we run out of dope, you run out of dope, too, Nicky.
I got me a safe house with over 3 tons of pure Persian.
that's enough to keep this city nodding for the next six months.
are a bunch of cracker-ass scumbags.
I'm gonna wear my best tux to those motherfuckers' funerals.
Nicky...
but I'm gonna do this for you, Carlito. And you gonna owe me.
I appreciate it.
you know, Nicky, l...
you have the most beautiful automobile I've seen in my life.
if I can just drive the car one time around the block...
papi, man, it would mean the world to me.
[snorting]
class-a Bolivian, man. Blow the fur right out that coat.
Carlito. How you doing?
there's two fuckup kids, never had a dime between them...
now they're throwing parties and driving new cars on 137th Street.
what's the address? Address?
you don't need an address.
I got them both in the trunk of my car.
[chattering in Spanish]
[Music playing]
[grunting]
Hey.
[Shad and Lee screaming]
come on, let's go.
[snorting]
guys telling me Reggie took off to Barbados to see his brother.
that's bullshit.
that kid ain't getting through customs with $2 million in cash.
no way, no how.
Mira, he got some girlfriend, lives in the Bronx.
21 Collins Avenue, Apartment 3A.
time to hit the Bronx.
time to drop off these guys to Artie first. Vamos.
you want to see something nice, Carlito?
here's your guy. Here's your guy, too. Carlito, take your guy.
here's some more of your guy.
come on.
[whooping]
[Nacho talking in Spanish]
did you see Artie's face...
when he opened the first bag, Carlito?
[Laughing]
Hey, Carlito, I ain't never gonna eat in that fucking joint again.
come on, let's go, Nacho. Nacho, come on.
here we go.
[guns cocking]
Earl, what the...
now you know I ain't had nothing to do with this bullshit.
Reggie called me...
talking about he want to come down to the island and hide out...
I took the first plane smoking. There's my ticket.
I landed this morning.
Carlito, don't listen to that fucking cocolo.
shut the fuck up.
Reggie, where's the money? Fuck you.
Puňeta, where's the money?
Reggie, tell them where the fucking money is.
just give it up and we'll let you walk.
nobody lettin' nobody walk.
[Nacho shouting in Spanish]
Reggie, there's six guys downstairs.
you kill us, you still ain't making it out this building.
tell me where the money is, we'll cook up a story for Artie and let you go.
Reggie, listen to him. This is your last out
I'm supposed to believe that shit? Listen to him!
I'm trying to help you out, Reggie. Fuck you, Carlito.
you said next time you see me gonna be bad.
you shouldn't have come looking then, because you dying first.
Reggie! Reggie!
[gun firing]
Earl.
just let me be, man, let me be.
come on, Carlito.
let's take this cocolo and put him on the meat hook.
he'll tell us where the money is.
he don't know where the money is, Nacho.
on the meat hook he will know.
he don't know nothing about no money, all right?
just tell Artie Earl never showed up.
you know I can't do that, Carlito.
walk away, Nacho! Just walk the fuck away!
Papito, don't forget, I got a contract for you, too.
kill me then. Kill us both.
if that's what I have to do, that's what I have to do.
well then, come on, motherfucker!
you want to go to hell? Let's all three go to fucking hell!
pull the fucking trigger!
[sighing]
Carlito, Carlito.
you listen to Nacho.
this loyalty that you have for your friends...
it's rare in this business.
but someday it's gonna get you killed.
Adios, Carlito.
Adios.
ain't nobody gonna find that money.
Reggie got it buried someplace.
you gotta get on the plane with me.
I do that, they kill Rocco - They'll kill you and Rocco...
whether you give them the $2 million or not, you know that.
we all got to get on that fucking plane.
Rocco's got family here.
running gonna buy us some time...
but it ain't gonna buy us forever.
I do not give a shit if you knock over Fort Knox.
if I don't get my $2 million back before the week's out...
your testicles are gonna be jammed in your eye sockets.
you get that? In your fucking eye sockets!
how much you got stashed, Charlie? A little over $500, 000.
all right, I got $600, 000.
suppose we throw it together and make $1 million down payment to Artie...
tell him we'll get him the rest.
I wouldn't give Artie Bottolota a nickel for a fucking parking meter.
he should've kept his $2 mil, let Reggie whack Artie Jr.
like that there'd be one less scumbag hanging off the Bottolota family tree.
that's real insightful, Charlie. I'll let him know.
where you going? Someplace I can think.
make out my will.
now you figure, why not just whack Artie and his boys?
kill one of them wiseguys, gotta kill a hundred.
they just keep coming after you.
got to come up with that $2 mil, Jack.
$30 million? That's wholesale.
you start cutting the shit up, it's worth 10 times that. Maybe more.
you're gonna bring down Hollywood Nicky?
look, he's got 3 tons of pure uncut heroin stashed in his safe house.
Charlie, nobody knows where that is. I do.
Yeah, how's that? Earl told me a while back.
Earl?
you're trading tips from the nigger...
that probably ended up with my $2 million?
you know something, Carlito? Suck on this!
pops! Hold on!
listen. We clean out Hollywood Nicky...
that's the end of his business.
all them junkies come running over to you, Artie. You'll be the kingpin.
now you want to start a 10-year war between us and the blacks.
the ltalians ain't taking down Hollywood Nicky.
the Puerto Ricans are.
it's not a bad idea, Pop.
you don't like the idea, pull the trigger.
you ain't never gonna see your money again.
okay, now. The cut dope goes out in laundry trucks...
every day.
the new dope goes in the same way twice a week.
Tuesdays and Fridays. Noon sharp.
we gonna boost one of the delivery trucks like half a mile from here.
we're gonna whack the driver and make the delivery.
only instead of 50 keys of junk it's gonna be me...
Colorado and about 20 other guys.
there's just five armed guards that work inside that place. They're all relatives.
people Hollywood Nicky trusts.
all we gotta do is kill them all and take it all.
so, what do you think?
what do I think?
make the score.
should have been here two hours ago.
Yeah. That's 'cause Hollywood Nicky's throwing dirt over him by now.
now you can take care of the $2 million on your own.
[truck horn honking]
[gate opening]
that's some good shit.
Attaboy. You did great.
our cut should be half of what's there. Half?
you can have the whole thing. At wholesale.
$10, 000 a key.
[Laughing]
Artie, you got to be kidding me.
fuck you. Fuck you.
you two work for us.
get the spic squad in gear and start moving all that shit.
see you later, fellas.
[Laughing]
okay. To us. We're gonna be rich, Pop.
we're gonna be...
[crashing]
what the fuck is that? Motherfucker.
it's Hollywood Nicky!
[guns firing]
what the hell was that? I don't know.
[police radio chattering]
[police siren wailing]
you want to go back? Are you crazy? Let's get out of here.
[sighing]
what's going on, fellas?
thought I had a flat.
it don't look flat.
heard on the radio they just found your boys...
up the road in that meatpacking house...
with about 10, 000 pounds of heroin.
they arrest wouldn't come everybody? Peacefully.
now they're all getting measured for rubber bags.
mind if I check your trunk? Be my guest.
what's this?
it's a whole lot of money.
$200, 000. $100, 000 in each bag.
[Grunts]
pleasure doing business with you, Carlito. Pleasure was all mine.
good luck, fellas.
you son of a bitch.
why, thank you, gentlemen.
no prisoners on this one, Jack. Just corpses.
[Chuckling]
you son of a bitch.
come on, Rocco, it's not like we turned into stools.
what? You ain't got a problem with us...
hiring a couple of cops to do a little killing on our behalf, do you?
$200, 000? That's a world record ever paid for a hit.
[All laughing]
let's get the fuck out of here.
big Jeff and Little Jeff...
wound up with a chest full of medals...
for taking out the whole Bottolota crew.
and the big war between Hollywood Nicky and the Puerto Ricans...
never got declared.
me and Earl went to Nicky at the get-go, told him my idea.
cause all we handed to over to Artie and his boys were 20 pounds of heroin...
sprinkled over the top of 5, 980 pounds of baby laxative.
but the guys who check the evidence...
aren't real big connoisseurs of dope.
they just clock what's on the scale.
I sure hope nobody tries getting high off that shit.
they'll have to cook up a whole kilo just to catch a buzz.
I dig that idea so much...
I ain't even gonna charge you for the 20 pounds of real dope.
out of sight, baby.
just call it my contribution to a planetary improvement.
we appreciate it.
you're not getting into my car with that fried fish.
I'm just gonna keep it for later.
you're not getting in the car with that stinking-ass fish.
come on, I got to go home and get changed.
move your fat ass.
Hey, guys. Y'all want to go to the fight tonight? Ringside.
maybe next time.
Hey, Nicky, thanks for everything.
anytime, baby.
you know I got low blood sugar, man.
I gotta eat a lot of meals. Get your ass in the car.
we did it. No, you did it.
being retired, I had a lot of time on my hands.
so Earl dragged me down to Barbados...
help him get ready for his wedding.
over here.
this is gonna be the ceremony right here. Come on, Earl.
you're gonna have me and Rocco stand on the beach all day in tuxedos?
what are you complaining about? Come here.
Earl's right. It's paradise down here.
only one thing missing.
maybe it's time for me to do like Earl. Shake loose.
no more walking on the wild side for me, Jack.
Carlito. I done changed.
reformed. Retired my ass to paradise.
Yeah, baby.
paradise.
only thing gonna drive me crazy...
is never knowing what happened with Artie's $2 million.
when you got them hanging on the meat hook...
they tell you everything.
[Music playing]
let's go, let's go!
I need a favor, Anna.
be careful with these.
take 'em only when necessary.
what do we got?
trapped arm. - One, two...
I'm going with him. - No, you're not.
this ain't up to you, lady.
you have a bit of a track record lately, wouldn't you say?
this isn't enough to warrant suspension.
be ready for the possibility.
evacuate immediately. - Go!
honey, this is my old girlfriend.
Anna, I'm just gonna lift your shirt and make sure everything's okay with the baby.
why don't you, give me a call?
just stay the hell away from us.
I'm not retracting my statement. Ever.
talk some sense into your man. - Excuse me?
I'd really hate to see things get uglier than they already are.
thank you for meeting me.
Yeah, of course.
I hope it wasn't an inconvenience.
no, no, no, no. Not at all.
I know you and Matt are close.
can I get you something to drink?
coffee's fine, thank you.
I didn't want to go to the chief about this because...
God, I'm so sorry.
it's okay. What's-what's wrong?
it's the detective Voight thing.
I didn't, I know your brother's been trying to help.
Yeah, that's right.
it's just I have never seen Matt like this, and I have a feeling that something bad is gonna happen.
I'm really sorry for everything you're going through, Hallie, I am, but I'm not sure what I can do.
Matt's deposition is scheduled after his shift.
once he testifies against Voight's son, it's-it's not worth it anymore just to prove a point.
and I'm thinking more and more that Matt shouldn't go through with it.
you should tell Matt.
I did.
last night.
he wouldn't listen.
but I think he would if it came from you.
hold still. Just relax.
I didn't do that! - Of course not.
look, this is as far as I can go.
you gotta come the rest of the way.
you mean drop? - That's right.
Zito...Big-time tagger.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've seen his name around.
he's hit every "l" train, bus stop, and mailbox in chicago.
you president of his fan club?
no. There's a street art exhibition at the MCA.
this clown's in the museum?
what a country. Right?
just slide on down nice and easy-I got you.
you called the cops!
all right, now! Just drop!
coming down.
copy. All clear.
all good? - Yeah.
graffiti artist got stuck up there, chief.
you got no reason to be here.
collecting gang intel, chief.
big new tag like that.
gotta make sure it doesn't spark a turf war.
you've seen it.
now leave.
you might want to take a step back there.
I don't want to charge you or one of your men with interfering with a police investigation.
Yeah.
pack it up.
we're outta here.
Casey. You got your deposition tomorrow.
come on, let's go.
let me ask you, is that cute little fiancee of yours gonna be there too?
cause I gotta tell you, the other night, when we were talking, she seemed kinda, I don't know, shut down.
but by the end, she really started to open up.
come on.
your day's coming.
your day's coming, Voight!
close the door.
you all right? - Yeah.
what do you want to do?
about? - You.
you want to go out on calls, stay here in the house, take some time off?
go out on calls.
then you have to do it right.
I have been.
you've heard me say this a million times.
in this job, regardless of what's going on in your life, you take your eye off it for one second, people can die.
you're right. I have heard you say that, and we're in agreement.
I wish I could do more to fix this, but right now, it is just a matter of trusting the system.
look, Matt, there won't be another warning.
look...
look, man, you wanna hit somebody, my buddy has a boxing gym over in Bucktown.
you get a trainer, you glove up, you hit mitts.
5 bucks a round.
we could head over there after shift.
Yeah, I'll think about it.
Thanks.
not to sound like my father-in-law, but this is what's wrong with america.
what's wrong with america, or what's great about america?
are you kidding me?
3, 000 clams for that, and I'm out there doing side jobs for $20 an hour?
the Mouch is looking for you.
do you know how much the taxpayers of this city pay for graffiti removal? 50 million a year.
that... That sounds high.
look it up.
all right, stop. All right, so it's more like 25 million or something.
either way, it's a lot of money.
and then this little wannabe hood rat.
Herrmann...It's bold. It's provocative.
you're just trying to get a rise.
and look at these high society douche bags lapping it up.
you see, this is why, when my kids get out of high school, cindy and me, we're moving to Chain o' lakes 'cause...
I can't deal with this insanity.
how long am I looking at? Realistically.
somewhere between 0 and 100 days.
do you understand the definition of "realistically"?
there's a lot of moving parts to this.
they're on your head.
have you ever even been to a suspension hearing before?
of course.
your case is a two-demerit issue, and so we're gonna keep it friendly.
and the more aggressive you come across, the more guilty you'll look.
keep your responses short and to the point.
all right, cool. So you're saying you got this, right, Mouch?
Yeah, but we still gotta prep. Where you going?
sorry, just what you needed, right?
one more person asking how you're doing.
better than nobody giving a rat's ass, I guess.
so... How are you holding up?
I'm just hoping that luck's on my side because in terms of me being able to control the situation, it hasn't worked out so well.
but I guess there is one more thing you could do to end this whole thing, right?
have you thought about retracting your statement?
would you?
I would think about it.
okay. Now that you have...
why would you advise me to do something you wouldn't?
ambulance 61, truck 81. Gunshot victim.
25 east Halstead street.
wait!
Where's the victim? - In the back.
shooter? - Gone.
I swerved when I heard the shots.
Cruz, Mills, in the bus.
cones and Flares.
get these cars moving.
shot to the neck. Not breathing.
weak pulse.
guys, we need your help.
all right, get him down here.
down here's good.
watch his head. Watch his head.
okay, you gotta get an open airway or we're gonna lose him right now.
here, open this.
we can't tube him. Too mush mouth trauma.
all right, surgical cric.
not approved in the field, Dawson.
excuse me, sir, does that really matter to you right now?
no? okay, good.
give it to me. - I got it.
Dawson, give it to me, now!
all right, give me the tube.
we'll get the backboard and stretcher.
chief.
keep it moving! Let's go, let's go.
surgical cric?
we could've waited for approval, but then he would have been D.O.A.
it was my call, chief.
I'll take the hit.
what was that?
no, you're gonna wait.
you're gonna do that? Go on.
your shift is over.
come on chief. - No, no, no, no. Go home.
head for the house. Whatever you want.
but you are done for today.
Where's Casey?
chief.
I'm not taking any more chances.
he's doing the right thing. He's getting his ass kicked for it.
you don't think I know that.
then he needs to be here where we can keep an eye on him.
Kelly, I tried that already.
so he's better off out there by himself, pissed off, - not thinking straight - This is a firehouse...
not some of the time. Not for some of the calls.
any man who walks through that door, he gotta be ready.
if he isn't, he's gonna be walking in the other direction.
cause I am a chief first and I am a friend second.
Casey's just gonna have to find his own way from now on.
saline?
two.
ambo bag? - One.
do you also want me to tell you how much gas we have left in the ambo tank?
cause, apparently, all I'm good for is inventory and driving now.
listen, one more black mark on your record between now and friday...
why even go to the hearing if you're already suspending me?
maybe I don't want to ride around with a half-assed reliever for three months, ever thought of that?
listen, chief did the right thing.
gave him some time to cool off.
he's gonna be fine.
we should eat, huh?
make a sandwich.
so Casey's out for how long?
chief knows that, not me.
I got a suspension hearing to prepare for.
send Dawson in, if you see her.
you know, I feel like we're sitting around like a bunch of pussies while we let Voight push our boy around.
why can't we take the ball game to him?
I got a wife and four kids who don't need their dad fired or locked up.
how 'bout you, Mills?
why aren't you asking me?
because I'm not talking about toilet papering Voight's house, o.
how 'bout it, Mills? - I'm down.
okay. The both of you, shut up.
nobody's gonna do nothin'.
so we just sit by? - Then go!
