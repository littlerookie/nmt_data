after WE LEARNED THAT OUR UNIT WAS GETTING REDEPLOYED.
when YOU COMFORTED HER, DID YOU HUG HER?
is THAT GROUNDS FOR SEPATION?
probably WOULDN'T BE IF YOU HADN'T BEEN SEEN HOLDING HANDS WITH SOME GIRL AT THE RACETRACK.
I WANT TO STAY IN THE SERVICE.
you SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE YOU DECIDED TO BE A LESBIAN.
you KNOW WHAT, I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT BACK.
I'm GOING TO ASSUME YOU'RE NOT A LESBIAN,
because THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PROVE
if YOU WANT TO WIN THIS THING.
let ME CLARIFY TO YOU, BEECH,
I NEVER DECIDED TO BECOME A LESBIAN,
but I DECIDED TO JOIN THE SERVICE.
I GRADUATED SECOND IN MY ROTC CLASS.
I HAVE A BRONZE STAR WITH V FOR VALOR
for SAVING THE LIVES OF THREE AMERICAN
and TWO IRAQI SOLDIERS
after AN IED ATTACK IN TAL AFAR.
I WATCHED MY STAFF SERGEANT ROBERT GANZ GET HIS STOMACH BLOWN OPEN AFTER A MORTAR ATTACK,
and HELD HIM IN MY ARMS AS HE DIED...
which, BY THE WAY, WAS NOT A ROMANTIC EMBRACE EITHER.
I BELIEVE IN AMERICAN DEMOCRACY,
and I'M WILLING TO RISK MY LIFE FOR MY COUNTRY.
do YOU REALLY THINK I DON'T BELONG IN THIS ARMY?
all RIGHT...
here's WHAT I'M HOPING FOR, WILLIAMS.
I'm HOPING THAT GIRL IN THE PARKING LOT TURNS OUT TO BE YOUR FIRST COUSIN,
and THAT THE TWO OF YOU WERE HAVING A HEATED ARGUMENT
about WHETHER TO PUT YOUR OLD GRANDMA IN THE NURSING HOME.
that's WHAT HAPPENED HERE, RIGHT?
Oh, LOOK AT THAT, SHE'S FROM SLOVAKIA.
scroll DOWN A BIT.
Hey, ALICE, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?
Oh, NO, NOT RIGHT NOW, SORRY.
I MADE A PODCAST.
what DO YOU MEAN, YOU MADE A PODCAST?
Yeah, AND I WAS HOPING YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT
you KNOW SEE IF MAYBE WE CAN---I GOT TO GET THIS.
Hey, HOW'D IT GO?
Oh.
stop WORKING.
sorry.
so...
do YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHO'S GOING TO BE THERE?
Yeah.
I KNOW THERE'S FRANK, AND...
what's HIS WIFE'S NAME?
Oh, AND WHAT ABOUT, UM...
MICHELANGE -MICHELANGELO, MY GOD,
how COULD I FORGET THAT?
so, TELL ME ABOUT HIM.
Oh, HE'S A CURATOR?
don't MAKE ME OUT TO BE SUCH A SNOB.
Oh, YOU'RE A SNOB.
no, I'M NOT. -OH, YES.
I'm NERVOUS.
Oh, GOD...
okay.
both HANDS.
hey...
so, WHAT HAPPENED?
fuck.
God, THO FKERS.
beech GOT DETAILED TO BE MY DEFENSE.
the HOMOPHOBIC PRICK?
Yeah, HE DOESN'T WANT IT.
he HAS TO TAKE IT, HE HAS NO CHOICE.
well, I DON'T SEE MY NAME HERE.
believe ME, ALICE, THEY KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
Oh, RIGHT, 'CAUSE THEY'RE THE MILITARY.
well, THEY DON'T KNOW WHO THEY'RE DEALING WITH.
I MEAN-- -ALICE...
that LAST ONE IS FALSE, BY THE WAY, THE ONE ABOUT MARTINEZ.
Yeah, I KNOW THAT.
you KNOW WHAT,
we'll FIGHT IT.
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN TO THAT.
what DO WE HAVE TO DO TO WIN THIS THING?
I HAVE TO LIE.
isn't THAT AGAINST YOUR MILITARY CODE OF HONOR?
what DO I HAVE TO DO?
do YOU NEED ME TO DISAPPEAR FOR A WHILE?
do YOU NEED ME TO LEAVE YOU ALONE?
no.
that's NOT WHAT I WANT.
because I CAN DO THAT.
I KNOW IT'S LATE IN THE GAME, BUT I CAN DO THAT.
I CAN BE REALLY ON THE D.L.
you KNOW. LIKE, JUST BE REALLY DISCREET,
and, LIKE, A NON-EXISTENT GIRLFRIEND.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW I CAN DO THAT.
I'm SORRY WE SHOULDN'T HAVE STOPPED TO EAT.
okay, SO...
there's HUAHINE, RAIATEA,
Bora BORA, AND MAUPITI.
the SOCIETY ISLANDS.
okay, WHERE...
TAHA'A?
flower-shaped ISLAND.
smells OF VANILLA.
and YOU HAVE A PLACE THERE?
tiny LITTLE PIECE OF PARADISE.
belonged TO MY GRANDFATHER.
if I EVER GET OUT OF HERE
you WILL.
you'll GET OUT.
Peabody, YOU GOT A VISITOR.
it's 10: 00 AT NIGHT.
I GUESS SOMEBODY'S PULLING SOME STRINGS.
you GOT FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES.
be RIGHT BACK.
Yeah, RIGHT.
hey...
take THIS.
Ooh, LET ME EAT YOUR PUSSY.
were I RECEPTIVE TO SUCH A PROPOSITION,
it WOULD FIRST REQUIRE A FULL BOOTY CHECK
and WERE YOU TO PASS MUSTER,
baby, I' IT TO YOU FAMILY STYLE.
don't WORRY, DARLING, MUMMY'S HERE.
where THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?
I've BEEN ON A TREASURE HUNT.
it WAS MAD.
we ENDED UP EXHAUSTED ON SOME NAMELESS LITTLE GREEK ISLAND.
I KNOW, I NEVER GO ON THESE THINGS,
but IN THIS CASE,
the WINNER GOT TO WALK AWAY WITH THIS MAGNICENT FRAGMENT OF A PRAXITELES FOOT.
quite GENUINE, I'M SURE.
so BREATHTAKINGLY BEFUL.
so PRICELESS.
so ILLEGAL.
sort OF LIKE YOU, DARLING
mummy, I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME FOR THIS.
Really?
well, SEEMS TO ME YOU'VE GOT GREAT GOBS OF TIME, HELENA.
Yes, LET'S NOT BOTHER WITH THE SMALL TALK.
shall WE JUST FINALLY SAY THAT YOU'VE LEARNED YOUR LESSON?
Oh, I'VE LEARNED A PHENOMENAL AMOUNT, MUMMY.
I've LEARNED THAT I CAN LOOK AFTER MYSELF
Oh, YES, WONDERFUL, SWEETHEART.
now, WHIT IS ON HIS WAY TO POST YOUR BAIL.
charming.
and HE'S BRINGING YOU A FRESH CHANGE OF CLOTHING.
you HAVEN'T LOST MUCH WEIGHT, HAVE YOU
I'm FINE, ACTUALLY, MUMMY,
and WHAT I DON'T WANT IS FOR
and WHAT WE'RE LOOKING INTO IS GETTING YOUR RECORD EXPGED.
that WILL COST A PRETTY PENNY, BUT I THINK IT'S TIME TO
no, MUMMY, I DON'T WANT THAT.
no? NO, MUMMY, I DON'T WANT WHAT? WHAT?
would YOU TRY TO SPEAK LIKE A SEMI-LITERATE PERSON, PLEASE, HELENA?
I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING RATHER SORDID COMPANY LATELY.
I've BEEN KEEPING VERY FINE COMPANY, MUMMY,
and WHAT I DON'T WANT IS FOR YOU TO COME SWANNING IN HERE,
throwing YOUR MONEY ABOUT I KNOW I MADE A MISTAKE.
I'm QUITE HAPPY TO FINISH MY TIME
and PAY MY DEBT TO SOCIETY.
Helena, PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.
for GOD'S SAKE, YOU'RE A PEABODY.
what DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE?
PEABODIES DON'T HAVE DEBTS, DARLING,
not TO ANYONE,
and CERTAINLY NOT TO SIETY.
thank YOU.
thank YOU, BONES.

Oh, MAN, SOUNDED GOOD.
Oh, FUCK.

I'm TELLING YOU, IT'S BEEN SITTING ON MY DESK FOR THREE WEEKS UNTOUCHED.
last NIGHT, I DO IT START TO FINISH.

and THEN I WENT IN MY CLOSET
got RID OF ALL MY OLD CONVERSE,
all THOSE LOW-ASS JEANS THAT YOU ALWAYS SEE ME IN.
I STARTED PRIORITIZING MY LIFE.
what DO YOU MEAN?
you KNOW, LIKE, SETTING GOALS FOR MYSELF.
like, UM... LIKE I WANT TO SEE SHAY EVERY THREE WEEKS,
and I WANT TO QUIT SMOKING, FOR SURE.
I'm TELLING YOU, TINA,
this CELIBACY THING IS LIKE A MASTER CLEANSE TO MY BODY.
you GOT TO TRY IT.
you KNOW, SHANE, I'VE GONE LONG PERIODS WITHOUT SEX.
it DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME SALUBRIOUS EFFECT ON ME.
SALUBRIOUS?
Yeah, SALUBRIOUS.
I LIKE IT.
SALUBRIOUS...
that's THE OTHER THING I'VE BEEN DOING.
trying TO EXPAND MY VOCABULARY.
now, I GO INTO THE DICTIONARY, I TRY TO MEMORIZE 10 WORDS A DAY.
it ACTUALLY WORKS.
so ANYWAY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO WEAR ON YOUR DATE?
come ON, WE NEED A WIDE RECEIVER.
come ON!
no, THANK YOU!
come ON!
Michelangelo BUILT THE SISTINE CHAPEL, YOU KNOW.

but THE LOG CABIN IN WYOMING, THAT'S WHERE HE SPENDS MOST OF THE YEAR.
you're IN VIOLATION, BY THE WAY.
we DON'T ALLOW WORK HERE AT THE SISTINE CHAPEL.
well, I GUESS I'LL JUST...

I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE DO THIS.
Hey, JENNY! -SHH!
she's MEDITATING.
here's THE PODCAST.
I HAVEN'T SHOWN IT TO ALICE YET,
but I'D JUST REALLY LIKE YOUR OPINION.
fuck IT.
I CAN'T.
I HAVE TO GO TO A SCREENING.
but YOU SAID YOU'D LOOK AT IT.
but I'M LATE, SO I'M GOING TO GO,
but I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD.
Bye.
sorry.
I'm GOING TO GO THAT WAY.
Bye!
sorry, JUST FORGOT MY KEYS.
fuck IT! I CAN'T DO THIS.
I CAN'T, I CAN'T...
I CAN'T DO THIS.
what ARE YOU DOING?
I MADE THIS PODCAST,
I HAVEN'T SHOWN IT TO ALICE YET.
and I JUST REALLY...
I DON'T KNOW, I'M JUST LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY'S OPINION.
well, I CAN...
I CAN TELL YOU MY OPINION, IF YOU WANT IT.
Really?
do YOU WANT MY OPINION?
sure. -WELL, GREAT
I've BEEN UP SINCE 5: 00.
I HAVEN'T DEALT WITH ANY DRAMA OR BULLSHIT,
so, WHAT DO I DO?
you, UH...

Yeah, RIGHT THERE.
Hey, BETTE, WHY DON'T YOU START THE ROUX?
I-I DON'T HAVE THE FAINTEST IDEA
how TO MAKE A ROUX.
have A GLASS OF WINE,
help ME SET THE TABLE.
what ARE YOU DOING TO HELP RESTORE SOME EQUANIMITY IN THIS FUCKING RIDICULOUS OVERPRICED ART MARKET?
uh, WHAT AM I DOING?
well, YOU'RE A BIG MOVER AND A SHAKER, AREN'T YOU?
you COULD BE DOING SOMETHING.
okay, BUT YOU'RE A BIG COLLECTOR, RIGHT?
let ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE SHOW THAT I CURATED LAST MONTH
at THE JACKSON HOLE ART CENTER.
I MEAN, 'CAUSE THERE WERE
at LEAST 10 PAINTINGS THAT WERE EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE ERIC FISCHL THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION.
what MAKES YOU SO SURE SHE'S GOT AN ERIC FISHER?
it's FISCHL, BONES.
and I BET YOU THAT SHE HAS ONE.
Hey, M, BE NICE.
I AM, I AM, I AM.
how CAN YOU DOUBT IT?
it's JUST THAT IT'S REALLY UNLIKELY
that THERE ARE 10 TRULY GREAT PAINTINGS
in A COMMUNITY SHOW.
when WAS THE LAST TIME THAT YOU EVEN LOOKED AT ART OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK
or L.A?
you KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I HAVEN'T SEEN A COMMUNITY ART SHOW IN A REALLY LONG TIME,
and I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SOME OF THE PIECES THAT YOU'RE SO EXCITED ABOUT.
Really?
awesome! LISTEN, UH...
I, UH, BHT SOME PICTURES,
and I COULD BRING THEM DOWN,
say, AFTER DINNER?
that WOULD BE GREAT. -YEAH!
you ROCK MY WORLD.
she's THE BEST.
di't KNOW THAT YOU WERE A COLLECTOR.
it DIDN'T SAY THAT ON YOUR PROFILE.
I JUST STARTED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
I'm SURE IT DOESN'T COMPARE TO YOUR EX'S COLLECTION.
no, NO, IT'S...
they're BEAUTIFUL.
I'm SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TALKED ABOUT MY EX SO MUCH AT DINNER.
it's FINE. IT'S FINE...
it WAS A BIG RELATIONSHIP FOR YOU.
it's NORMAL TO TALK ABOUT IT.
would YOU LIKE A GLASS OF WINE?
we'll TAKE THAT MONEY.
you HAVE REALLY GREAT TITS.
augmented.
you WENT FOR IT.
do YOU LIKE THEM?
put YOUR FACE IN THEM.
spread YOUR LEGS OPEN.
do YOU LIKE IT WHEN I TALK DIY?
Hey, WE NEED TO GO.
I'm SORRY, BUT MY SISTER WAS ROBBED AT GUNPOINT LAST NIGHT.
is SHE OKAY?
she's FREAKED,
but I REALLY WANT TO GET BACK BEFORE SHE STARTS DRINKING.
Oh, THE GIRL HAD A FUCKING GUN POINTED AT HER
let HER HAVE A DRINK.
uh, MY SISTER IS AN ALCOHOLIC,
so THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE WORST THING I COULD DO.
I PACKED YOUR SUITCASE,
so WE'RE READY TO GO.
uh, IF YOU WANT TO STAY,
I'll DRIVE YOU BACK.
that's FINE,
if THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
no, OF COURSE NOT.
I'll GO HOME WITH YOU.
you WERE JUST MAKING THAT UP BACK THERE, WEREN'T YOU,
because YOU WERE HAVING SUCH A LOUSY TIME?
uh, YEAH, I JUST MADE UP THAT MY SISTER GOT ROBBED AT GUNPOINT
to GET OUT OF BOWLING?
why WOULD I EVER WANT TO GIVE UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEAR SMELLY USED SHOES,
drink WARM DOMESTIC BEER, AND KICK YOUR ASS?
wait UNTIL NEXT YEAR.
nice TO MEET YOU. -HEY...
I'll SEE YOU. -YEAH
they TOOK MY WHOLE WEEK.
Oh, SWEETIE, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE MONEY.
I'm JUST SO GLAD THEY DIDN'T HURT.
I'm JUST GOING TO BE IN THE NEXT ROOM IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.
okay.
I'll LET YOU GO TO SLEEP.
she'll BE OKAY.
they're TAKING MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE AWAY FROM ME.
Hey, KIT, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'm REALLY SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
Oh, NO, THANKS, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I JUST GOT TO KEEP BUSY.
you're HERE! HEY!
she's FREE!
welcome HOME. -OH, THANK YOU.
Thanks. I'M SO GLAD YOU ALL CAME.
I JUST WANT TO SAY, YOU KNOW, GOODBYE
before I LEAVE.
where ARE YOU GOING?
wait, WAIT, ISN'T THERE GOING TO BE A TRIAL?
actually,
our FAMILY DOESN'T GO ON TRIAL.
we GENERALLY GO TO EUROPE.
are YOU LEAVING THE COUNTRY BEFORE THE TRIAL?
we've GOT BRENDAN ABBOTT.
he's THE BEST CRIMINAL ATTORNEY IN CALIFORNIA.
he's GOING TO GET THIS RECORD EXPUNGED.
until THEN, WE WILL BE RECOVERING FROM OUR IGNOMINY IN A COUNTRY
with A VERY HEALTHY NON-EXTRADITION TREATY.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE LEAVING.
well, I ONLY WISH I COULD SAY IT WAS
because I THOUGHT HELENA HAD LEARNED HER LESSON, - BUT I CAN ASSURE YOUT THAT - WHAT DOES SHE MEAN BY THAT?
any FUTURE REHABILITATION OF HELENA'S CHARACTER WILL BE IMPOSED UNDER A MORE RIGOROUS PROGRAM
than THE LOS ANGELES LESBIAN LIFESTYLE CAN PROVIDE.
at LEAST PARIS WHEN SHE WAS IN THE CLINK
didn't GET INVOLVED WITH SOME BIG BUTCH PRISON DADDY DYKE.
you HAVE REALLY OUTSTRIPPED YOURSELF THIS TIME, MY GIRL.
I SUPPOSE YOU ALL HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS DUSTY PERSON?
dusty? GIRL, GOOD FOR YOU.
it WASN'T FOR PROTECTION.
turns OUT SHE'S ONE OF THE MOST ENLIGHTENED, BEAUTIFUL WOMEN THAT I'VE EVER KNOWN
Oh, FOR GOD'S SAKE, HELENA,
just GIVE US A BREAK.
our FLIGHT'S IN AN HOUR.
can I HAVE AN ADULT BEVERAGE?
I THOUGHT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A PARTY.
how ABOUT SOME GIN AND ANGOSTURA BITTERS?
got IT COMING.
I'm GOING TO THE LOO.
Hey, HELENA, HELENA, HEY...
where ARE YOU GOING?
I-I CAN'T...
are WE EVER GOING TO SEE YOU AGAIN?
I DON'T KNOW.
I HOPE SO.
well, I'M GOING TO MISS YOU.
Thanks.
you've BEEN A REALLY GOOD FRIEND.
how YOU HOLDING UP? -NOT GOOD.
can I? -YEAH, OF COURSE.
I'm LEAVING, SHANE.
I KNOW. YOUR MOM TOLD US.
no.
not WITH HER.
look, CAN YOU COVER FOR ME?
say I'IN THE BATHROOM OR SOMETHING?
Yeah, I CAN COVER FOR YOU, BUT WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I, UM...
I HID THE MONEY.
I'm GOING TO GET MY FRIEND OUT OF PRISON,
and WE'RE GOING TO GO SOMEWHERE.
this CELIBACY THING IS LIKE A MASTER CLEANSE TO MY BODY.
you GOT TO TRY IT.
remember OUR PLAN, IF WE EVER GET OUT OF HERE.
I JUST WANT TO SAY, YOU KNOW, GOODBYE.
wait, WAIT, WAIT, ISN'T THERE GOING TO BE A TRIAL?
am I EVER GOING TO SEE YOU AGAIN?
I WANT TO STAY IN THE SERVICE.
should HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE YOU DECIDED TO BE LESBIAN.
what DO WE HAVE TO DO TO WIN THIS THING?
I HAVE TO LIE.
Hey, ALICE, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?
Oh, NO, NOT RIGHT NOW.
I MADE A PODCAST.
there's NOTHING WRONG WITH MEETING PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET.
it's JUST HARD TO FIND SOMEONE AFTER BETTE.
she SET THE BAR.
I DON'T KNOW, WHAT DO YOU WEAR ON A DATE WITH A HEART DOCTOR?
we'll TAKE THAT MONEY.
they TOOK MY WHOLE WEEK.
lez GIRLS IS YOUR CREATION.
she's THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD POSSIBLY DIRECT THE PICTURE.
directing? LEZ GIRLS?

I NEVER SAID THAT.
I JUST SAID I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET, AND THAT'S ALL.

Oh, 'CAUSE TASHA CAN'T BE OUT IN A LEZZIE BAR,
and I GOT INVITED TO A BARRY BURD PARTY WITH A GUEST.
the ENTERTAINMENT LAWYER?
Yeah, YOU KNOW, HE'S FAMOUS FOR THOSE VELVET, LIKE,
Mafia UNDERGROUND-TYPE PARTIES FOR ALL THE CLOSETED HOLLYWOOD HOMOS,

you HAVE TO SIGN A NON-DISCLOSURE FORM.
crazy.
nice WORK. OKAY.
everyone GRAB A PARTNER AND SOME PADS.
we're GOING TO LINE UP FACING EACH OTHER AND GO OVER SOME PUNCHING TECHNIQUES.
why DON'T YOU WANT TO GO?
I've NEVER BEEN TO ONE OF THE L. A. LESBIAN CLUBS BEFORE.
except FOR THE PLANET ON THURSDAY NIGHTS.
that's MY POINT.
I JUST, I DON'T WANT TO GO TO A BAR
that's, YOU KNOW, IN DIRECT COMPETITION WITH MY SISTER.
Oh, IT'S NOT IN COMPETITION.
I MEAN, THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM FOR EVERYBODY,
and BESIDES, IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT WOMEN'S BUSINESSES.
Yeah, JUST LIKE IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU GUYS ARE HERE SUPPORTING ME TODAY.

because ALL THE LESBIANS IN HOLLYWOOD WANT TO BE IN THE MOVIE.
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT TOO MUCH, JENNY.
Aw, FUCK OFF.
my AGENT'S LIKE, "YOU SHOULD WEAR A T-SHIRT"

Oh, THAT'S NOTHING.
I MEAN, ALICE GETS, LIKE, 50 IN THE FIRST HOUR THAT SHE POSTS.
what ARE THEY SAYING? - AH...
what?
nothing, JUST SOME IGNORANT JERK.
read IT TO ME.
this IS A LESBIAN SPACE.
I DON'T REALLY NEED TO KNOW
that MAX SWEENEY THINKS OF HIS ENLARGED CLI AS A BIG DICK,
and HIS FREAK GIRLFRIEND LIKES TO SQUEEZE HIS TITS,
and THAT'S WHY HE DIDN'T GET TOP SURGERY.
I GUESS THAT'S WHY WE POSTED IT, RIGHT?
to EDUCATE PEOPLE LIKE THAT, RIGHT?
whatever.
Oh, HOLD ON.
Hey, ALICE.
Max, YOU INVADED MY SPACE TO PUT OUT YOUR OWN AGENDA,
and IT WASN'T COOL AT ALL,
but HERE'S WHAT I'LL DO. YOU CAN BLOG ONCE A WEEK.
I'll PUT YOU IN YOUR OWN LITTLE BOX ON THE HOME PAGE,
not WITH THE GUESTBIANS.
why NOT WITH THE GUESTBIANS?
because IT'S A LESBIAN SITE, MAX,
and I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET BOMBARDED WITH A BUNCH OF DYKES, YOU KNOW,
flipping OUT ABOUT THIS TRANSGENDERED THING.
you CAN'T SEGREGATE TRANS PEOPLE OUT OF THE LESBIAN COMMUNITY. I MEAN
no, I'M NOT SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW,
lesbians AND TRANSGENDERED CAN'T SHARE THE SAME SPACE.
I'm JUST SAYING...
good AFTERNOON, MA'AM.
we're LOOKING FOR AN ALICE PYE-SZECKI?
I GOTTA GO.
I'm ALICE PIESZECKI.
I'm MAJOR DOROUGH.
this IS LIEUTENANT FINNERTY.
we'd LIKE TO TALK TO YOU FOR A FEW MINUTES.
did... DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO TASHA?
are YOU REFERRING TO CAPTAIN WILLIAMS?
Yeah, BUT...
can WE, UH... TALK INSIDE FOR A MINUTE?
just TAKE A MINUTE.
Yeah, SURE.
why ARE YOU HERE? WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
we JUST WANT TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS, MA'AM.
it's NOTHING TO BE ALARMED BY.
what's YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CAPTAIN WILLIAMS?
we're FRIENDS. YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION.
what's "VELVET PARK"?
it's A MAGAZINE.
did YOU WANT TO ANSWER MY QUESTION?
dyke CULTURE IN BLOOM.
gay L. A.
you GOING, FINN?
uh, NO.
I ASSUME YOU ARE.
you KNOW WHAT, YOU DON'T HAVE A SEARCH WARRANT,
so I'D LIKE YOU TO LEAVE.
Oh, DON'T WORRY, MISS PYE-SZECKI.
I CAN CALL YOU "MISS," RIGHT? YOU'RE NOT MARRIED OR ANYTHING?
so...
what IS THIS?
um... NOTHING. IT'S...
wait A MINUTE.
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.
it's LIKE A LOW-TECH VERSION OF WHAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR LESBIAN WEBSITE.
is CAPTAIN WILLIAMS ON THERE?
no.
who's "T"?
someone WHO DIDN'T WANT THEIR NAME ON THERE?
you SHOULD GO. NOW.
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.
come ON, DOROUGH.
well, THANKS FOR YOUR TIME, MA'AM.
I HOPE WE DIDN'T DISTURB YOU TOO MUCH.
Oh, FUCK.
fuck...
and THEN, HE PUT THE GUN TO HIS HEAD AND HE PULLED THE TRIGGER.
he HAD A GUN?
it TURNED OUT TO BE SOAPSTONE.
he CARVED IT HIMSELF,
but IT LOOKED TOTALLY 100% REAL.
you KNOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE A VERY DISTURBING PIECE OF ART, LANI.
it WASN'T ART, DEAN PORTER.
everyone IN THE ROOM WAS TRAUMATIZED BY IT
you KNOW, SOMETIMES SOME PEOPLE ARE PRETTY UPSET BY YOUR WORK.
sometimes THAT'S WHAT ART SEEKS TO DO.
standing IN FRONT OF A CLASS
and THREATENING TO BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT ISN'T WHAT ART SEEKS TO DO.
it WAS SELF-INFLICTED TERRORISM.
I'm GOING TO LOOK INTO IT.
don't BLOW ME OFF, DEAN PORTER.
I'm NOT BLOWING YOU OFF, LANI.
I'm JUST GOING TO GATHER SOME MORE INFORMATION.
I'm GOING TO TALK TO JUSTIN AND PROFESSOR LERNER.
now, I UNDERSTAND HOW UPSET YOU ARE, BUT I ALSO KNOW
that IF IT HAD BEEN YOUR PROJECT THAT HAD CAUSED SUCH CONTROVERSY,
you WOULD HAVE WANTED A FAIR HRING.
are YOU GOING TO BE OKAY?
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK YOU ARE, LANI,
and I'M HERE IF YOU NEED TO TALK TO ANYONE.
Jesus.
vipers DON'T LOVE, KARINA, THEY POISON.
I MEAN, I STILL FEEL YOUR VENOM COURSING THROUGH MY VEINS.
I MEAN, YOU USED ME AS A PAWN...
I LIKE HER. - YEAH, SHE'S NATURAL.
she's GOOD. - YEAH.
I MEAN, HOW MANY RELATIONSHIPS HAVE YOU RUINED. I MEAN...
there IS NO WAY THAT I'M CASTING NIKI STEVENS. SHE CAN'T ACT.
Jenny, SHE'S THE BEST ACTOR FOR THE ROLE.
she HAS STAR QUALITY. LOOK AT HER.
she LOOKS LIKE SHE JUST WALKED OUT OF MAXIM MAGAZINE!
I'm SORRY, IS THAT A BAD THING?
aaron, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SHE'S A WRITER.
I MEAN, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL, YOU'RE A WRITER,
why CAN'T SHE PLAY A BEAUTIFUL WRITER?
because IT LOOKS LIKE THE LAST BOOK SHE READ WAS 10 YEARS AGO, "ARE YOU THERE, GOD? IT'S ME, MARGARET."
okay, SO WHO'S YOUR CHOICE?
LUCHI SANTIS IS MY CHOICE.
that GIRL IS TOO WEIRD. - SHE'S THE BEST ACTRESS
she's TOO INTENSE.
that's THE CHARACTER, - SHE'S NOT ATTRACTIVE
have YOU READ THE SCRIP, AARON?
she's NOT FUCKABLE!
look, NIKI HAS HEAT BEHIND HER.
she's GOT A HUGE MOVIE COMING OUT. - SO FUCKING WHAT?
so WE NEED HEAT TO PUT ASSES IN THE SEATS!
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT KIND OF A RISK I'M TAKING ON THIS FILM?
Jenny, JENNY, LOOK. LOOK AT HER.
I MEAN, SHE COMPLETELY SOLD THE KISS.
that's REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACTRESS
that LOOKS LIKE SHE ENJOYS KISSING OTHER WOMEN.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT, ADELE, STOP WRITING.
get ME WILLIAM ON THE PHONE.
william IS IN GENEVA. I SPOKE WITH WILLIAM THIS MORNING,
and HE'S OVER THE MOON WITH NIKI.
he SAW A SNEAK PREVIEW OF HER NEW FILM, - HE LOVES HER.
and HE SAID HE'D RATHER HAVE HER THAN NATALIE PORTMAN, OKAY?
so ARE WE FINISHED? - NO, WE'RE NOT FINISHED.
you GOT THE FUCKING DGA CARD.
why DON'T YOU DIRECT THE WHOLE MOVIE
Yeah, I'LL DIRECT THE MOVIE!
why DON'T YOU FUCKING PAY FOR THE MOVIE?
go FUCK YOURSELF, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU HAVE A S-SMALL DICK.
we MAKE THIS MOVIE WITH NIKI STEVENS, OR WE DON'T MAKE THE MOVIE!
how DOES SHE KNOW HOW BIG MY DICK IS?
I THINK SHE'LL COME AROUND.
excuse ME?
well, YOU KNOW, SHE'S QUITTING SMOKING,
and SO SHE'S JUST REALLY FRAGILE RIGHT NOW,
but I THINK IF YOU JUST LET HER GET THROUGH HER PROCESS
who ARE YOU? WHO IS SHE?
it's JENNY'S ASSISTANT.
look, I'M GOING TO CALL NIKI STEVENS' AGENT,
all RIGHT? I'M GOING TO CALL HER TODAY.
I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH HER.
Tina... - WHERE ARE YOU GOING RIGHT NOW?
get SCHECTER ON BOARD.
I DON'T WANT A CRANKY DIRECTOR.
I WANT HER TO LOVE NIKI STEVENS LIKE IT WAS HER OWN IDEA.
Capiche? - CAPICHE.
I NEED THE SLIDES BY WEDNESDAY.
no. NO, THE MEETING IS ON FRIDAY.
I NEED A DAY TO GO OVER THEM.
you WANTED TO SEE ME, DEAN PORTER?
Yeah, I NEED IT BY FRIDAY.
if IT DOESN'T COME BY FRIDAY,
then IT'S OF NO SERVICE TO ME OR TO ANYONE.
that's RIGHT.
okay, GREAT.
no, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
all RIGHT, THANKS.
wednesday, WEDNESDAY. BYE.
how COULD YOU LET A STUDENT
stand IN FRONT OF YOUR CLASS WITH A GUN POINTED TO HIS HEAD?
it WASN'T A REAL GUN.
who TOLD YOU IT WAS A REAL GUN?
I KNOW THAT IT WAS CARVED OUT OF SOAPSTONE,
but APPARENTLY IT LOOKED VERY REALISTIC,
and NOW LANI SHIPMAN HAS BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY IT.
Lani SHIPMAN'S TRAUMATIZED BY HER SHADOW.
do YOU WANT SOME DINNER? - NO.
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME ABOUT THIS IDIOT WHO MADE THE GUN SCULPTURE.
he's TALENTED.
you're NOT GOING TO SUSPEND HIM FOR THIS?
no, OF COURSE NOT.
come ON.
you KNOW MY POSITION ON FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, - BUT IN THIS CLIMATE- - WHAT CLIMATE IS THAT?
what CLIMATE IS THAT? - YEAH.
uh... COLUMBINE?
virginia TECH?
is THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT ME TO DO?
I WANT YOU TO BE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE THOUGHTFUL SOMETIMES.
I THINK ABOUT MY STUDENTS ALL THE TIME.
I THINK ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT THEM,
how TO CHALLENGE THEM,
and I THINK ABOUT HOW TO... HELP THEM GROW AS ARTISTS.
so WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I KNOW, I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW...
look, I'M NOT SAYING...
that YOU DID ANYTHING WRONG.
thank YOU.
okay, I'M GOING TO GO, THEN. I'M HUNGRY.
am I DISMISSED?
well, YOU COULD KISS ME GOOD NIGHT.
good NIGHT. - GOOD NIGHT.
I THINK I'M GOING TO WORKING LATE TONIGHT.
maybe TOMORROW?
if YOU'RE LUCKY.
are YOU ALONE? DID ANYONE FOLLOW YOU?
what? - OH, GOD...
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? ARE YOU OKAY?
no, I'M NOT OKAY.
what THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? - I'M DE-GAYIFYING.
Oh, GOD, THANK GOD THEY DIDN'T TAKE A PICTURE.
they DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A WARRANT.
if THEY EVER COME HERE AGAIN, THERE'LL BE NO EVIDENCE OF GAY.
you KNOW WHAT?
you SHOULD KEEP THIS SOMEWHERE SAFE.
wait, HOLD IT. IF WHO EVER COMES HERE AGAIN?
the TWO MILITARY MEN. TWO!
Oh, SHIT...
I KNOW, THEY WERE FUCKING NAZIS. THEY SCARED ME.
well, WHAT DID THEY WANT?
they CAME IN, OKAY,
they're JUST WALKING AROUND LOOKING AT THINGS.
they TRIED TO GET ME TO OUT YOU, WHICH I DIDN'T, I SWEAR.
I JUST SAID, YOU KNOW, "LEAVE." THEY SHOULD LEAVE.
Oh, SHIT, I'M SO SORRY.
I KNOW. WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?
I DON'T KNOW. I'M SO SORRY THIS HAPPENED TO YOU.
I DIDN'T TELL THOSE FUCKERS A THING THEY COULD USE AGAINST YOU, OKAY?
not A THING.
Hey, YOU HEARD FROM HELENA?
well, SHE TOLD ME TO TELL EVERYONE
not TO WORRY ABOUT HER.
well, SHE MUST HAVE A HIDDEN TREASURE SOMEWHERE.
I DON'T THINK SO.
maybe SHE'S WITH DUSTY. I DON'T KNOW, SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME.
I JUST HOPE SHE'LL BE SAFE. - SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE.
are YOU SURE THIS ISN'T GOING TO KEEP ME AWAKE?
no. IT'S CHOCOLATE. IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.
now, LOOK IT, YOU GOT THIS BIG OL' APPETITE THESE DAYS.
you KNOW, I'M SUBSTITUTING FOOD FOR SEX.
Amen TO THAT.
so, WHAT YOU PLAYING?
I'm PLAYING "LARA CROFT, THE LEGEND."
Oh, SHE'S A HOTTIE.
MM-HM... - I'M NOT.
look HOW FAST YOUR THUMBS ARE GOING.
well, I GOT ALL THIS EXTRA ENERGY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL TO DO WITH IT ALL.
what's THE MATTER? YOU OKAY?
earth TO SHANE...
what?
what? - WHAT, YOU OKAY?
I'm FINE. I'M GOOD. UM...
can I...
can I GET THAT TO GO?
Williams, WHAT ARE YOU DOING- - WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
that THEY WERE GOINGO SEND THEIR DOGS TO MY FRIEND'S HOUSE?
keep YOUR VOICE DOWN AND TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.
you're SUPPOSED TO BE MY LAWYER.
you're SUPPOSED TO BE ON TOP OF THIS!
you're CROSSING LINE RIGHT NOW, YOU REALIZE THAT?
I REALIZE YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT ME,
but YOU HAD AN OBLIGATION TO TELL ME
that MY FRIEND'S PRIVACY AND HER HOME WOULD BE INVADED.
it's NOT AUTOMATIC.
they DON'T ALWAYS- - YEAH, BUT YOU KNEW THAT THEY MIGHT, - AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME! - WHO'D THEY TALK TO?
they WENT TO HER APARTMENT, AND THEY INTERROGATED HER.
she's AN INNOCENT CIVILIAN, BEECH.
well, SHE'S PART OF THEIR CASE BECAUSE OF YOUR ALLEGED RELATIONSHIP WITH HER.
are YOU ON THEIR SIDE?
I'm REPRESENTING YOU IN THIS PROCEEDING. - ARE YOU ON THEIR FUCKING SIDE?
are YOU JUST GOING TO STAND BACK
and LET THEM RIP APART MY FUCKING CAREER
and DESTROY MY FUCKING LIFE?
what's GOING ON? - IT'S OKAY.
Henry IS SLEEPING. - IT'S OKAY. I KNOW.
it's OKAY.
excuse ME, MA'AM. I'M SORRY.
I'm SORRY TO BUST INTO YOUR HOUSE LIKE THIS WITHOUT ANY WARNING.
you're NOT ANY PART OF THIS. YOU'RE NOT EVEN IN THE SERVICE,
and IT WAS WRONG OF ME TO DISRUPT YOUR HOME AND YOUR FAMILY,
and TO PROBABLY FRIGHTEN AND CONFUSE YOU.
I HOPE I DIDN'T WAKE YOUR SON.
please FORGIVE ME.
please GO WITH ME?
please?
it's NOT WORTH THE RISK FOR ME.
why DON'T YOU JUST GO THE PARTY ON YOUR OWN?
the WHOLE POINT OF GOING TO THE PARTY IS GOING WITH YOU.
that's THE WHOLE POINT.
it's GOING TO BE HOLLYWOOD UNDERCOVER.
it'll BE REALLY TIGHT SECURITY,
and IT'LL BE, LIKE, TOP SECRET, AND...YOU KNOW.
and WE'LL GET TO BE OUT TOGETHER,
like, OUT OF THE HOUSE REALLY TOGETHER.

it's EASY TO USE, THE AIM IS GOOD, TRIGGER PULLS QUICKLY,
and DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF BULLET, THE RECOIL IS LOW.
I JUST WANT SOMETHING TO SCARE SOMEBODY.
if YOU PULL OUT A GUN, YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED TO USE IT.
you WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT YOURSELF.
well, WHY DON'T I JUST KEEP IT WITHOUT BULLETS?
you CAN'T FIRE A GUN WITHOUT BULLETS.
now, YOU LOAD IT BY OPENING UP THE CYLINDER.

just DROP THE BULLETS IN,
close UP THE CYLINDER,
aim, PULL THE TRIGGER.

but I THINK SHE'S COMING THIS WAY.
Oh, MY GOD, HI!

my AGENTS WOULD TOTALLY FREAK IF THEY SAW ME HERE, BUT

okay,
can I JUST SAY HOW MUCH THIS CHARACTER MEANS TO ME?
I MEAN, I AM DYING TO PLAY HER, JENNY.
I MEAN, I ACTUALLY HAD TO HARASS MY AGENTS TO EVEN PUT ME UP FOR IT,
and THEY WERE COMPLETELY AGAINST THE WHOLE THING,
but, YOU KNOW, I SAID I'D FIRE THEM IF THEY WOULDN'T LET ME DO IT.
you DID?
Yeah, I MEAN, ALL THEY WANT ME TO DO ARE THESE STUPID MICHAEL BAY FILMS.
I MEAN, I ACTUALLY GOT OFFERED TO PLAY NICOLAS CAGE'S GIRLFRIEND,
and HE'S LIKE, WHAT, 50 OR SOMETHING?
so, NIKI, WHAT'S THE DEAL? YOU WANT TO BE IN MY MOVIE?
more THAN ANYTHING.
I HAVE NEVER WANTED TO BE IN SOMETHING SO BADLY IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
Why?
because IT'S... IT'S MY LIFE.
I MEAN, OKAY, IT'S NOT ACTUALLY MY LIFE, OBVIOUSLY, BUT...
have YOU EVER JUST READ SOMETHING THAT'S JUST SO TRUE?
I MEAN...
the FIRST TIME THAT I EVER FELL FOR A GIRL, IT WAS JUST...
it WAS SO INTENSE, AND...
she COMPLETELY BROKE MY HEART.
then WHEN I WAS READING THROUGH YOUR SCRIPT, I JUST...
I JUST KEPT THINKING, LIKE,
I HAVE DONE THESE THINGS, AND I'VE FELT THESE FEELINGS,
and THIS CHARACTER, IT'S ME, JENNY.

except FOR YOU.
I MEAN, I GET IT, ALL RIGHT?
I KNOW WHAT I LOOK LIKE, AND I KNOW WHY GUYS LIKE ME,
and ALL THAT FUCKING HOLLYWOOD BULLSHIT,
but, JENNY, THERE IS MORE TO ME THAN THAT,
and I NEED TO PROVE THAT THERE IS,
and THAT I CAN DO THIS.
I WILL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE INSIDE OF ME FOR THIS ROLE.
look, MY AGENTS ALREADY TOLD ME
that THE STUDIO'S GOING TO MAKE YOU HIRE ME NO MATTER WHAT.
is THAT WHAT THEY SAID?
yeah...
but I DON'T WANT THAT, JENNY.
I WANT YOU TO WANT ME.
I MEAN, YOU ARE THE DIRECTOR,

and GIVE IT TO NIKI.
Oh, MY GOD.
Oh, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

and IT MADE ME REALIZE WHY I WANTED TO DO THIS FILM

but WAS STILL UNABLE TO DEFEAT IT.

especially TO SO MANY OF YOU WHO ARE HERE.

who HAVE SUCCUMBED TO BREAST CANCER,
and OUR FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES WHO ARE SURVIVORS.

I DON'T WANT JODI TO KNOW ABOUT US.
she's GOING TO FIND OUT EVENTUALLY.
no, I MEAN,
I DON'T WANT HER TO KNOW
that WE WERE FOOLING AROUND BEHIND HER BACK.
I MEAN, IT'S OKAY IF SHE THINKS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IT,
but I DON'T WANT HER TO THINK THAT WE ACTED ON IT,
you KNOW, BEFORE THE TWO OF YOU BROKE UP.
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW.
except FOR KIT.
Yeah, NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW. THAT'S FINE.
she DOESN'T...SHE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW.

how LONG DO YOU THINK THIS WILL LAST FOR?
I HAVE NO IDEA,
but I AM NOT DRESSED FOR THIS WEATHER.
we LOVE YOU, NIKI!
does THAT EVER BOTHER YOU?
no, MOST OF THE TIME IT'S FUNNY.
so, UM, HOW LONG HAVE YOU AND JENNY BEEN FRIENDS FOR?
a FEW YEARS.
where DID YOU GUYS MEET?
Bette AND TINA HAD A PARTY A FEW YEARS AGO,
and THAT'S WHEN JENNY FIRST MOVED TO L. A.
Oh, YEAH, YEAH, WE SHOT THAT SCENE.
Yes, WE DID. - YES.
so, DID YOU GUYS EVER HOOK UP?
who, ME AND JENNY?
Yeah. - FUCK, NO.
why NOT? - NO.
my FRIENDS ARE ALWAYS HOOKING UP WITH EACH OTHER, SO...
no. NOT IN THIS CASE.
you KNOW, SHE'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL, - YES, SHE IS.
and YOU'RE NOT SO BAD YOURSELF,
so I'M SURPRISED.
well, I FIGURE THAT,
just BECAUSE YOU CAN, IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD.
Hey, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
fuck.
my PUSSY IS SO NUMB.
what? WHAT? - LISTEN...
can YOU PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE STALKER?
I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT MY STALKER.
Yes, YOU DO. - NO.
she's BEEN FOLLOWING YOU AROUND FOR 30 MILES.
yeah? WELL, THAT MEANS I HAVE 170 TO GO.
are YOU GOING TO COME WITH?

but YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME BECAUSE THAT WAS THE BET.

I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GAY, I DON'T KNOW IF I'M STRAIGHT,
but I KNOW THAT I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.
we HAD TERRIBLE SEX.
no, IT WAS GREAT FOR ME!
you DON'T JUST GET ON A BIKE AND KNOW HOW TO RIDE IT.
same WITH RIDING A GIRL.
so I FREAKED OUT, BIG DEAL!
you've JUST BEEN WITH SO MANY GIRLS,
you DON'T REMEMBER YOUR FIRST TIME.
well, GUESS WHAT, IT WAS MY FIRST TIME,
and IT WAS GREAT,
and IT WAS BETTER THAN WITH RICHARD,
and WITH GUYS, AND WITH ANYBODY,
and I'M REALLY INTO YOU,
and I SWEAR NEXT TIME, I WILL SO GO DOWN ON YOU!
Molly, MOLLY, MOLLY, YOU'RE MAKING A SCENE.
please...
seriously, WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE WITH ME?
think ABOUT IT, BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
using ME TO GET BACK AT YOUR MOTHER THE WHOLE TIME.
I HAVEN'T.
I HAVEN'T BEEN USING YOU.
I've NEVER FLOWN TO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST
to CHASE A GIRL I BARELY KNOW,
and I'M HERE, AND I'M REALLY CRAZY ABOUT YOU,
and I NEED YOU TO GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE,
even IF I'M AWFUL IN BED!
I KNOW THAT I'M STILL GAY 101, BUT I'M A REALLY FAST LEARNER,
and BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, I'M GOING TO
be IN ADVANCED PLACEMENT GAY,
and THEN GRADUATE LEVEL GAY, AND FUCK LAW SCHOOL,
I'll GET MY DOCTORATE IN FUCKING GAY!
are YOU GOING TO STOP TALKING?
Yes.
you PROMISE? - UH-HUH.
no MORE PINK, THOUGH.
Oh! LADIES, LOOK AT THIS...
so MANY, THERE'S SO MANY...
we LOVE YOU, DANA, AND WE...
we MISS YOU EVERY DAY.
you're IN OUR HEARTS, DANA.
I WISH ANGIE WAS WITH US TODAY.
she WOULD LOVE THIS.
Yeah, SHE WOULD.
God...
isn't THERE, LIKE, A HOTEL OR SOMETHING
we COULD CHECK INTO?
girl, AND RENT A CAR
so WE CAN DRIVE THE REST OF THE WAY?
Hey.
where HAVE YOU BEEN?
I've BEEN HERE FOR, LIKE, TWO HOURS ALREADY.
what? - SLOWPOKE.
what YOU BEEN DOING?
hanging OUT WITH T AND NICOLE.
Oh, YEAH?
no? - NO, I'M GOOD.
no, WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT OLD TIMES.
they WANT US TO HANG OUT WITH THEM LATER IF YOU WANT TO.
I THINK YOU'D REALLY LIKE THEM.
I'd KIND OF LIKE TO HANG OUT WITH EVERYONE HERE.
I WOULDN'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT LEAVING,
but YOU SHOULD IF YOU WANT.
no, IT'S COOL. - YEP?
we CAN JUST GET UP WITH THEM LATER IN L. A.
should I LIFT IT?
Yeah, LIFT... YOU HAVE TO...
hold... - OKAY, I'LL HOLD IT.
ready?
no, I GOT TO PUT THIS IN, HOLD ON...
Oh, MY GOD, LOOK AT THIS!
this IS SO FUCKING COOL! - I LOVE IT.
Hi, GUYS. - I LOVE IT. MERCI, MERCI, MERCI.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT YOUR PRIVACY.
what THE FUCK IS THIS, THE TAJ MAHAL?
Oh, HEY, TINA, NO, NO.
I HAD PRODUCTION MAKE A PRODUCT PLACEMENT DEAL WITH NORTH FACE.
the ONLY THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO
is TAKE A PICTURE OF NIKI IN FRONT OF THE TENT.
will YOU POSE FOR ME?
Yeah. - OKAY, ONE, TWO,
three.
beautiful.
no, THIS GOES IN HERE.
Yeah, I KNOW.
it SAYS YOU PUT TAB B INTO SLOT J.
you're DOING IT WRONG.
look, I'M NOT AN IDIOT.
I CAN JUST... I CAN FOLLOW SOME SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS.
look, AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT
if YOU WOULDN'T SECOND-GUESS ME.
Oh, CHRIST...
do YOU MIND JUST CLOSING THE CURTAINS FOR US, PLEASE?
sure.
what KIND OF BULLSHIT TENT IS THIS?
it WAS ON SALE AT COSTCO.
and YOU EXPECT ME TO HAVE ADVANCED PLACEMENT LESBIAN SEX IN THIS SHITTY RUNT TENT?
Yeah, I DO.
awesome.
what THE HELL IS THAT?
is THAT JENNY'S TENT?
I THINK SO.
my GOD, IT LOOKS LIKE A CONDO.
Yeah, I DON'T THINK SHE GOT THAT
on SALE AT COSTCO.
come ON.
what?
come ON.
Oh, MY GOD!
Adele! WE'RE BEING KILLED!
thank YOU.
it's SO HARD TO DO THIS BY YOURSELF.
I'm USED TO PUTTING THINGS TOGETHER,
but BETTE WOULDN'T LET ME HELP HER.
Yeah, SHE'S KIND OF O. C.D.
was SHE MOODY WITH YOU?
Yeah, SOMETIMES.
she CAN BE MOODY.
something's GOING ON WITH HER,
but I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
is ANGELICA OKAY?
Yeah, SHE'S FINE.
voila.
thank YOU.
have A GOOD NIGHT.
Oh, YOU FAKED US OUT? -YEAH.
God, DO YOU EVER STOP WORKING?
no, NOT REALLY.
so, WHAT'S YOUR DEAL?
are YOU GAY OR WHAT? COME ON.
it DEPENDS.
depends ON WHAT?
it DEPENDS ON WHO'S ASKING.
I'm ASKING.
are YOU SEEING ANYONE?
I'm SINGLE.
this IS GREAT, WE SHOULD SET YOU UP.
because THAT'S WHAT THESE RIDES ARE FOR.
I MEAN, CURING CANCER AND ONE-NIGHT STANDS.
totally.
I THINK THAT, UH...
I'd PREFER TO JUST FOCUS ON MY WORK.
come ON, THAT'S BORING.
okay, ALL RIGHT.
okay, THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT I HAVE MY EYE ON.
who?
it's A SECRET.
Yeah. -OKAY, I'M BEING SUMMONED.
okay, BYE.
I SURE HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
I HAVE IT COMPLETELY UNDER CONTROL.
don't WORRY ABOUT IT.
keep TELLING YOURSELF THAT, BABY GIRL.
Hey, YOU MIND IF I CUT IN?
no, YEAH.
thank YOU.
so YOU TALKED TO MOLLY.
Yeah. WHAT CAN I SAY,
I'm A SUCKER FOR A PRETTY FACE.
and HERE I THOUGHT YOU WERE HARD TO GET.
I'm NOT HARD TO GET.
not HARD TO GET, JUST HARD TO KEEP.
I'm GLAD YOU AND JENNY WORKED IT ALL OUT.
me TOO. I TOTALLY LOVE HER.
we MADE A CAMPFIRE.
what ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?
I WAS JUST...
I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW CRAZY IT IS
to SEE OLD FRIENDS, YOU KNOW?
Yeah.
I MEAN, THEY WERE LIKE A WHOLE LIFETIME AGO,
and THEN IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE MILITARY.
and NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IT'S ABOUT.
you JUST NEED TO GIVE YOURSELF TIME TO ADJUST, YOU KNOW?
figure THINGS OUT.
okay, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HAPPEN?
with WHAT? WHEN?
like, IN THE FUTURE. I MEAN, DO YOU WANT KIDS?
do YOU WANT TO STAY IN L. A?
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ULTIMATE CAREER?
God...
just QUESTIONS.
just LITTLE QUESTIONS.
I-I GUESS...
I GUESS I WANT KIDS, EVENTUALLY,
but NOT NOW.
I DON'T THINK,
and, YOU KNOW,
I'm REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS TV SHOW,
if I GET THE JOB.
I REALLY LIKE IT UP THERE, YOU KNOW?
it's EXCITING.
Yeah.
Why? WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.
let's MOVE IN TOGETHER.
Really?
Yeah.
okay.
Yeah, LET'S DO IT.
why NOT?
this IS SERIOUS STUFF.
don't YOU THINK?
I'm NOT LEAVING YOU ALONE IN THE TENT ANYMORE.
we're SUPPOSED TO BE MAKING S'MORES.
are YOU HUNGRY AT ALL?
Yeah.
yeah? -MM-HM.
want TO GO? SOMEWHERE ELSE?
you WANT TO GO?
Yeah, I DO.
Yeah, LET'S GO.
want TO EAT THAT?
no, THANK YOU.
look AT KIT'S, THEY'RE BLACK.
Yeah, TOTALLY.
they're, LIKE, TOTALLY BURNED.
she's AN EXPERT AT EVERYTHING.
that's RIGHT.
that's TOO MUCH CHOCOLATE!
no, DON'T WASTE THE CHOCOLATE!
Oh, MAN, ARE YOU SERIOUS?
I BRIBED THE SAG DRIVER
to GIVE US A LITTLE PRIVACY.
because YOUR RUNT TENT SUCKS.
Hey, I TRIED.
I KNOW.
it JUST DIDN'T GO VERY WELL.
not HARD ENOUGH, OBVIOUSLY.
is THAT GOOD?
Yeah.
any HOT TIPS?
breathe THROUGH YOUR MOUTH.
Really?
really. -OKAY.
here IT IS!
you BOUGHT ME A PRESENT?
I'm GOING TO DOCUMENT THIS MOMENT.
here WE GO.
it's A PRESENT FOR BOTH OF US.
what DO YOU THINK?
that's NOT THE REACTION THAT I WANTED TO ELICIT.
Jenny, IT'S A PURPLE PENIS.
Yeah.
what AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS?
I'm NOT A DUDE.
it's FUN, AND IT'S...
have YOU EVER USED
it's A FAKE DICK. JENNY, I'M NOT A MAN
I KNOW, BUT WHAT'S THAT?
are YOU GOING TO STRAP ME IN
with THIS FABULOUS WESTERN HARNESS?
listen.
do YOU LIKE TO FUCK ME?
a LOT.
so...
you're JUST GOING TO FUCK ME WITH THAT.
okay, THEN.
give ME THE CAMERA BACK. I'M DIRECTING.
what? -YUP.
I'm SCARED ABOUT YOUR IDEAS.
we ARE GOING TO MAKE A MOVIE.
we ARE?
and THIS IS MY STAGE.
what DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
I WANT YOU FIRST TO TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS.
that's MUCH BETTER.
me TRES TRES BIEN, NON?
you're SO BEAUTIFUL.
you're BEAUTIFUL.
you FORGOT THE STILETTOS, MY LOVE.
Oh, YEAH...
the STILETTOS ON.
fuck!
Yes!
very PROFESSIONAL HERE.
there WE GO.
now YOU LOOK LIKE A DIRECTOR.
now I MEAN BUSINESS, YOUNG LADY.
take OFF YOUR PANTS.
that's THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR ACTORS
to LISTEN TO YOU.
and NOW,
we GO BACK TO ACTING. GIVE ME THIS.
okay.
you FOGGED MY LENS.
now...
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.
it's JUST A JOCK.
there WE GO.
I FEEL LIKE I'M ABOUT TO GIDDYUP.
LUBE!
no, JENNY...
what?
don't!
what?
MEEP, MEEP.
let's MAKE IT HARD.
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A TAIL.
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
how ARE YOU GOING TO FUCK ME?
like A MAN.
hard?
so PUT YOURSELF INSIDE OF ME.
okay.
and YOU HAVE TO TELL ME BEFORE, OKAY?
okay. THAT'S IT.
I CAN'T FEEL WHAT I'M DOING.
Yeah, THERE WE GO.
is IT IN?
Yeah.
now JUST START FUCKING ME.
don't NEED ANY LUBE. -YOU'RE SO WET.
I AM SO WET.
does THAT FEEL GOOD?
Yeah.
harder?
Yeah.
I LOVE YOU FUCKING ME.
I GIVE YOU AN A-PLUS.
thank YOU.
will YOU COME VISIT ME WHEN I GO BACK TO SCHOOL?
maybe.
I DON'T LIKE THE COLD, THOUGH.
I'll KEEP YOU WARM.
okay.
so, WHAT IS IT,
what KIND OF LAW IS IT THAT YOU'RE STUDYING?
I WANT TO BE A PUBLIC DEFENDER.
it's NOT GLAMOROUS, AND THE MONEY SUCKS,
but I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY EFFECT CHANGE
is PERSON-TO-PERSON.
so YOU WANT TO DEFEND THE LITTLE GUY?
somebody HAS TO.
I WOULD NEVER EXPECT THAT FROM YOU.
I'm FULL OF SURPRISES.
I BET YOU ARE.
what DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
I DON'T WANT TO COME YET.
I DON'T WANT TO COME YET.
this WAS FUN.
ghost STORY?
ghost STORY.
I WANT TO TELL A GHOST STORY.
okay, THERE'S THIS GUY, HE'S A REGULAR GUY.
he's A BANKER, OR MAYBE HE'S A AD GUY
doesn't MATTER. FORGET IT.
he's STRESSED OUT, THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING.
so HE DECIDES TO GET A CABIN IN THE WOODS
by HIMSELF FOR THE WEEKEND.
why DO PEOPLE ALWAYS DO THAT?
especially WHEN THEY KNOW
some CRAZY SPOOKY SHIT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM.
okey, SO HE PACKS HIS SUV.
he BRINGS THINGS FOR WORK, LIKE...
work STUFF,
and THEN HE BRINGS BOOKS,
and HE BRINGS HIS DOG,
a GOLDEN RETRIEVER,
and HE STARTS DRIVING UP TO THE MOUNTAINS.
when HE'S DRIVING, HE HEARS ON THE RADIO
that AN INMATE HAS ESCAPED
from THE LOCAL INSANE ASYLUM
that's SUCH BULLSHIT.
you're NOT TELLING A HOMICIDAL MANIAC ESCAPES
from THE INSANE ASYLUM STORY, YOU'RE NOT.
just WAIT FOR IT. JUST WAIT.
okay.
so HE HEARS THIS NEWS, HE DOESN'T CARE.
whatever, HE JUST WANTS TO GO RELAX.
he HAS A FANTASTIC DAY AT THE CABIN.
does ALL SORTS OF ADVENTUROUS THINGS,
and AT NIGHT, HE'S EXHAUSTED.
so HE PASSES OUT ON THE COUCH.
he's READING A BOOK, HE'S GONE.
in THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, HE WAKES UP.
he HEARS THIS REALLY WEIRD SOUND,
and IT'S JUST LIKE, "DRIP...
DRIP...DRIP..."
he's TOO TIRED TO GET UP AND SEE WHAT IT IS.
so HE CALLS HIS DOG OVER.
his DOG LICKS HIS HAND.
he FEELS BETTER, HE FEELS COMFORT,
then HE FALLS BACK TO SLEEP.
a COUPLE OF HOURS LATER,
he HEARS THE SAME SOUND.
he WAKES UP, AND HE'S LIKE, "THERE'S THE DRIPPING.
again."
drip, DRIP, DRIP...
but HE'S STILL WAY TOO TIRED TO GET UP.
dog COMES OVER, HE LICKS HIS HAND,
he FEELS BETTER, FALLS BACK ASLEEP.
so THAT MORNING, THE SUN COMES UP.
it's VERY BRIGHT IN THE ROOM.
he LOOKS OVER.
he SEES A GIANT POOL OF BLOOD.
he STARTS SCREAMING.
he LOOKS UP,
his DOG, THE GOLDEN RETRIEVER,
is IMPALED BY THE CHANDELIER
hanging FROM ABOVE.
the BLOOD IS GUSHING DOWN,
dripping.
there's THE DRIP SOUNDS.
he LOOKS OVER,
and THERE'S A LITTLE NOTE.
he PICKS IT UP.
it's WRITTEN IN BLOOD,
and IT READS, "PEOPLE CAN LICK TOO."
it's ACTUALLY A TRUE STORY.
my GRANDMOTHER TOLD US THAT STORY.
it's NOT REAL...
it's NOT SCARY.
that's SO STUPID!
I COULD TELL BY THE SCREAMS.
whatever...
that's STUPID.
it SEEMED FUNNY WHEN I BOUGHT IT.
did YOU GET THOSE AT THE 99-CENT STORE?
and A FEW OTHER SPECIALTY ITEMS.
well, IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.
made ENOUGH NOISE.
how OLD ARE WE, 12?
guys, LET'S PLAY A GAME.
Yes. -LET'S PLAY TRUTH OR DARE.
Totally! YES, YES, YES.
no...
truth OR DARE IS SO AWESOME. -NO...
...always END UP RUNNING AROUND NAKED...
Oh, THAT IS GOOD. YEAH, LET'S PLAY THAT.
how DO YOU PLAY?
you GO AROUND THE CIRCLE,
and YOU SAY A STATEMENT, "I NEVER," LIKE, UH...
I've NEVER EATEN POTATO CHIPS," OKAY,
and THEN IF YOU HAVE, YOU DRINK, SO IT'S THE OPPOSITE.
but YOU DO THINGS LESS LAME THAN "I ATE A POTATO CHIP.
well, YEAH, OBVIOUSLY. OH, SHUT UP.
okay, I'LL GO FIRST, I'LL GO FIRST.
um...
I've NEVER SLEPT WITH A GIRL.
and NOW YOU DRINK.
so YOU DRINK WHEN IT'S OPPOSITE.
Adele, I KNEW IT.
you DO SLEEP AROUND WITH GIRLS.
I DO.
girls, HUH?
what?
I SAID MAYBE.
okay, GO, ADELE.
your TURN.
I NEVER LIE ABOUT WHO I'M SLEEPING WITH.
Ooh...
you?
well, I DID THAT ONE TIME.
Oh, HENRY, YES.
Yeah, DON'T REMIND ME.
okay, COME ON, LEZBOS,
let's AMP IT UP. THIS IS LAME.
fuck, YEAH.
Yeah, THEY'RE GETTING BORING.
all RIGHT, TINA, GO.
uh...
I've NEVER HAD SEX IN A PUBLIC PLACE.
uh, WILL SOMEBODY BRING ME A BUCKET?
okay, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
what CONSTITUTES PUBLIC?
like A BATHROOM STALL?
nothing WITH A DOOR.
like, NOT A BATHROOM, OR AT A PARTY, OR ANYTHING.
Really?
in A CAR?
Jenny, YOU GO.
okay, UM...
I'm JUST GETTIN' DRUNK OVER HERE.
I SEE.
how ABOUT...
I've NEVER BEEN IN LOVE.
Aw...
you've NEVER BEEN IN LOVE?
I DON'T THINK SO.
I MEAN, MAYBE I HAVE,
but I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THAT IS.
okay, UM,
I NEVER CHEATED ON A GIRLFRIEND.
who'd YOU CHEAT ON?
the ONE?
Yeah.
I KISSED ANOTHER GIRL
while I WAS GOING OUT WITH MY FIRST GIRLFRIEND.
that'll DO IT.
kissing ISN'T LIKE CHEATING-CHEATING.
Yes, IT IS. -WHAT?
kissing IS CHEATING! -WELL, UH, YEAH.
totally CHEATING. KISSING?
it TOTALLY IS.
no.
I DON'T KNOW. JODI'S SAYING, "I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PEOPLE IN THE RELATIONSHIP.
I DON'T WANT THE WORLD, MAKING, YOU KNOW, JUDGMENTS
on WHAT I SHOULD DO IN MY RELATIONSHIP.
but NOBODY LIKES TO BE FUCKED AROUND,
like, BEHIND THEIR BACK.
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T THINK KISSING COUNTS. IT'S NOT CHEATING,
nor DO I THINK SLEEPING WITH SOMEONE.
fucking?
well, YOU KNOW, UNLESS YOU SLEEP WITH A PERSON -MORE THAN ONCE. -MORE THAN ONCE?
Oh, MY, GOD, THAT'S SO STUPID.
not IN MY BOOK, IT'S NOT.
no, NO, I AGREE WITH SHANE.
I MEAN, MESSING AROUND IS JUST MESSING AROUND, RIGHT?
I MEAN, YOU CAN STILL BE LOYAL TO SOMEONE IN YOUR HEART,
and I MEAN, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
right.
wow, YOU GUYS HAVE GREAT MORALS.
yeah...
I AGREE WITH JODI.
I THINK THAT IT DEPENDS ON
your AGREEMENT AS A COUPLE.
so IF YOU GUYS SAY THAT YOU'RE IN A MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP,
then YOU'RE IN A MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP,
and I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE IN AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP,
then YOU'RE IN AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP.
like WHEN YOU CHEATED ON ME WITH CLAUDE?
who's CLAUDE?
the FRENCH GIRL.
we WERE BROKEN UP.
what?
I DON'T WANT TO...
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK SEXUAL JEALOUSY
always WEIGHS DOWN A RELATIONSHIP.
that's BECAUSE YOU'RE A HO.
I AIN'T A HO, BITCH.
kinda.
don't YOU GO PROJECTING.
she's A HO.
so DOES THAT MEAN THAT I COULD SLEEP WITH
any ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS, AND YOU WOULDN'T CARE?
not IF YOU CAME HOME TO ME AFTERWARD, NO.
Really?
smile.
no. -LET ME SEE.
Oh, MY GOD, YOU GUYS ARE ON CRACK.
I'm HALF KIDDING. LIKE, FUCKING IS CHEATING
kissing IS CHEATING,
whether YOU DO IT 40 TIMES OR ONCE, IT'S CHEATING.
I AGREE, YEAH. WORD.
crazy PEOPLE.
cheating!
and THINKING IS CHEATING.
Oh, MY GOD...
thinking?
what? YES! IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HAVING SEX
with SOMEBODY BESIDES YOUR PARTNER
and FLIRTING WITH THEM,
that's INTIMACY
that YOU'RE GIVING SOMEBODY ELSE -BESIDES YOUR PARTNER. -OH, MY GOD...
it's CHEATING! WHAT?
thinking?
what ABOUT, UM...
okay, WHO HERE, PUT UP YOUR HAND
thinks THAT KISSING'S CHEATING.
no, I DON'T.
well, IF THINKING'S CHEATING,
then KISSING'S DEFINITELY CHEATING.
Yeah, I THINK KISSING'S CHEATING.
Bette, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
you DIDN'T RAISE YOUR HAND.
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST...
I THINK IT'S A TRAP TO JUDGE.
I MEAN, I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS,
and YOU CAN'T REALLY
Oh, MY GOD, THAT IS SUCH A NON-ANSWER.
BETTE...'CAUSE SHE WAS A BIG OL' CHEATER.
Oh, GIVE HER A BREAK, COME ON.
I'm NOT JU... I'M NOT JUDGING.
who's GOT THE NEXT "I NEVER"?
Yeah, WHO'S GO THE NEXT ONE?
Bette, COME ON, I MEAN, YOU CHEAT.
you WERE A GIANT CHEATER.
it's NOT-IT WAS A PHASE.
I'm NOT SAYING YOU ARE NOW, BUT, LIKE, YOU CHEATED ON TINA,
you CHEATED ON ME.
I MEAN... YOU CHEATED.
there WAS A LOT OF CHEATING.
right? YOU GUYS, COME ON!
you SAW IT. YOU WERE THERE.
okay, LEAVE ME ALONE. SORRY.
were YOU?
are YOU CHEATING ON ME?
Tina, WHERE YOU GOING?
Oh, FUCK...
fuck. FUCK.
fuckin' NICE, BETTE.
W-what THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?
did I S...
I WAS KIDDING.
fuck.
she DOESN'T WANT TO SEE YOU, BETTE.
she WANTS YOU TO GO AWAY.
what THE FUCK?
what's GOING ON?
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
are YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH BETTE?
since WHEN?
maybe A MONTH.
a MONTH? -A MONTH?
why DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
because YOU HAVE A BIG MOUTH.
shit.
are YOU GUYS GETTING BACK TOGETHER?
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK WE'RE DOING.
wow... THIS IS FUCKING CRAZY.
crazy.
I NEVER SAW THIS COMING.
ever.
what THE FUCK
what THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?
I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST HAPPENED.
shit LIKE THIS DON'T JUST HAPPEN.
I MEAN, YOU DON'T WAKE UP WITH SOMEBODY BY ACCIDENT.
did YOU FORGET? -FORGET WHAT?
how TERRIBLE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH TINA WAS?
I MEAN, YOU WERE MISERABLE!
you HATED EACH
you HATED EACH OTHER.
okay, MAYBE, I DON'T KNOW,
maybe THE SEX JUST TOTALLY MADE YOU LOSE YOUR MIND.
I DON'T KNOW.
you KNOW, YOU AND JODI HAD THIS WONDERFUL SHOT -AT SOMETHING REALLY HEALTHY-- -NO, WE DIDN'T.
and THEN YOU WENT AND FUCKED IT UP!
Jodi AND I NEVER HAD A SHOT.
we DIDN'T. IT WASN'T WORKING.
I LOVE TINA.
I've ALWAYS LOVED TINA.
Aah...
and I KNOW THIS TURNED OUT SO BADLY,
and I DIDN'T MEAN IT TO HAPPEN THIS WAY.
I KNOW THAT I'M GOING ABOUT IT ALL WRONG,
but I'M DOING IT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.
I WAS TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
Yeah, WELL, YOU KNOW,
it SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR BETTE.
you KNOW, IT'S WHAT'S RIGHT FOR BETTE.
Jodi IS GOING TO BE DEVASTATED.
she MOVED HER WHOLE LIFE OUT HERE TO BE WITH BETTE.
I'm NOT TRYING TO GUILT-TRIP YOU, T, I SWEAR.
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN THIS WAY, OKAY?
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO COME ON THIS TRIP.
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN
are YOU IN LOVE WITH BETTE?
again?
I've ALWAYS BEEN IN LOVE WITH HER,
and I FEEL LIKE AN ASSHOLE THAT I'M DOING THIS TO JODI,
but I JUST WANT HER BACK,
and I'M SCARED, 'CAUSE I KNOW WE'RE JUST GOING TO, LIKE...
probably FUCK IT UP,
but I HAVE TO DO IT, YOU KNOW?
I CAN'T HELP IT.
it's SOMETHING THAT I CAN'T HELP.
I WANT TO BE WITH HER.
okay.
you GUYS, YOU KNOW...
you BELONG TOGETHER.
Yup, YOU DO.
you ALWAYS HAVE.
it's TRUE.
I FUCKING HATE WOMEN.
Yeah, WELL...
that's SOME FUCKED UP SHIT, TINA.
Mm-hm.
DRAMA-RAMA.
it's SO DIFFICULT.
Bette AND TINA SHOULD HAVE STAYED TOGETHER.
they SHOULD HAVE HAD THE COURAGE
to WORK IT OUT,
instead OF JUST RUNNING AWAY
from EACH OTHER LIKE THAT.
fuck...
instead OF WREAKING ALL THIS FUCKING HAVOC.
well, WE CAME BACK TO EACH OTHER.
Yeah.
and THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
well, I'M IN NO POSITION TO JUDGE.
love MAKES PEOPLE SO INSANE.
do YOU KNOW THAT MY FRIENDS THINK I'M OUT OF MY MIND
for FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU?
well, THEY DON'T KNOW US.
we're DIFFERENT, JENNY.
do YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE...
movie THINGS,
or DO YOU THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE IT?
we're GOING TO MAKE IT...
and I'M GOING TO LOVE YOU... FOREVER.
I PROMISE.
I'm SORRY. I'M SORRY.
they LEFT ALREADY.
Jodi WANTED TO RIDE HOME ALONE.
what are you thinking about?
I was just thinking how convenient it is for me that it's considered hip to drive a $20, 000 hybrid.
dork.
and how lucky I am that you love me.
I love you, too, babe.
I'm 29 years old, I'll be 30 next month.
when I was a kid, I used to close my eyes and try to picture myself at 30, and this is what I saw,
a great job, still best friends with the guys I grew up with, and in love with a beautiful girl.
so far, I gotta say that my life has turned out pretty much exactly the way I imagined it.
we have something to tell you.
you're getting... - A baby.
a baby? - Yeah.
Oh, my God!
how did you do that?
well...
I'm 10 weeks. - You are 10... Oh, my...
fabulous! - Ten weeks.
Oh, yay, yay! - Congratulations, Michael.
fantastic.
sweetheart, champagne! I'm overwhelmed.
all right. Champagne.
let's get some champagne. Let's drink a toast. Oh, my...
honey, where's the champagne? - It's in the bar, under the sink.
now, you can't have any champagne, but we can drink for you.
we're very good at that.
all right, I'll be right back.
don't say another word, please, until I'm here.
so, what do you think? - Well, I think it's a...
it's a very big thing.
traditionally, not the first big thing of your adult life.
we've talked about getting married before.
we just...
you know, Michael's been so busy working, and I'm in the middle of my dissertation, and it just...
I don't know, it feels weird now.
we don't want people thinking we're getting married 'cause we have to, - because that's not why we would. - Nobody will think that.
remember Lucy's wedding?
Oh, honey, please.
that girl's a slut. She completely trapped that guy.
case in point.
no one's gonna think that about you.
open this, darling.
it's warm!
well, of course it's warm. We never drink it.
if I open this, it's going to explode.
it's all right. Just live on the edge, Stephen.
open the bottle.
open the bottle because I'm a grandmother, - and I want to celebrate! - Okay, here we go!
come on, get it while it's hot.
Hooray, hooray. - That's for you.
Oh, my God. - Oh, my...
no, just a little, Dad. - It's the last drink you're gonna have.
all right. To my little girl and her little boy.
or girl. - Or girl. I was going to say that.
and here's to the young man who's responsible for the whole thing.
who's feeling more responsible by the second.
quite right.
Cheers. - Cheers.
if you have to settle down, if you absolutely have to become an adult, and have a baby and all that comes with it, this is the kind of woman you want to do it with.
you couldn't ask for a better girl.
your cousin stayed fat.
Tricia was enormous to begin with, baby.
she grew to the size of a parade balloon when she was pregnant but then she went back to being a regular fat-ass.
the point is, she's a fatter ass now than she was before.
and, you know, she's always dieting.
she talks about dieting.
if you look in her purse, it looks like she just went trick-or-treating.
you're cruel.
I am going to be fat and ugly.
baby, no matter how fat you get, you could never be ugly.
and as long as I can find these perfect breasts amidst all the rolls, I'll be happy.
and this ass!
you have the greatest ass in the world! - Wait, wait!
so when it's large, it'll just be that much greater!
come on! What? I can't hear you! - Stop! Stop it!
I can't hear you!
you are so pathetic.
Oh, my God, why? Why? What did I do to deserve this?
you're just an incredibly lucky woman.
will you start eating with me, big boy?
Yeah, we'll go pickle for pickle. - Promise?
Yeah, I'll bring my cousin over. We can snack on her belly.
don't. That's gross.
that's Izzy. I gotta go. - No, don't. No.
don't go.
are you going to be really late?
no, because I have plans for your boobies later.
I don't want you to know.
I'm gonna tell them privately. Don't listen.
okay.
okay, we'll talk later. No, you can't. Okay, bye.
I heard.
honey, does it bother you at all that we didn't plan this?
that it just happened?
what are you talking about? Not at all.
it's gonna be great.
Really? - Yeah.
if you got him strippers, I'm going to have to take you down.
come on, Jenna. You know I'm not into that.
where did you find them?
it's your wedding, man.
like your brothers are gonna let you down.
so beautiful.
Oh, fuck.
you all right, man? - Yeah, I'm fine.
it's okay, man. Let it out, buddy.
is he okay? - Yeah, fine.
no, no. He's fine. - He does this all the time.
it's very hard for him, you know, because his mother was a lesbian, and she passed away very recently.
you guys should just keep going.
you gotta push through because what you're doing is beautiful.
I'm fine. I'm all right.
come on, let's take a little break. - No, no.
we'll take a little break. Let's go outside, we'll get a little air.
okay? Girls, back to work.
I'm sorry. Don't mind me. - Careful, don't slip on the ass beads.
step over them. There we go.
I just loved knowing, you know?
like, I saw my whole life laid out in front of me. Perfect.
and then that bitch just yanked it all away from me.
just...
you know? It's like...
of course, you know.
you and Jenna are like the same person.
now you're having a baby? - Yeah.
how intense is that? - Pretty intense.
I envy you, you prick.
I quit the cheese company.
what?
dude, isn't your dad still in the hospital?
I just can't do it anymore, man.
I told my Uncle Gary. I gave him my notice on Friday.
he kind of freaked on me.
I'll bet.
I told him I'm taking a road trip. - You're taking a road trip?
Wow. Where you going, buddy? Six Flags?
Tierra del Fuego.
on a motorcycle.
but you get nauseous when you leave the ZIP code.
exactly.
...find the happiness that has eluded your mother and me.
to Eva and Mark!
Cheers! - Cheers!
Eva and Mark! - Eva and Mark!
I'm overwhelmed by this miracle that has happened to me.
and as happy as I am to see all of you at my wedding,
I'm happiest to see her.
isn't she beautiful?
she's nothing compared to you.
did I get my own "aw"? - You did.
thank you so much for coming.
we are both overwhelmed.
Oh, no.
I'll be back.
2 o'clock.
thought she wasn't coming. - I know. You think he's seen her yet?
probably.
can we talk to you for a second? - All of you?
Arianna, what are you doing here? You know he's gonna go crazy.
what do you want me to do, Chris? Hide under a rock?
no, but a little sensitivity might be nice.
he's a wreck, Ari.
come on, we're asking you. Don't do this.
do what? I'm not doing anything.
shit.
what are you doing here?
they're my friends, too.
have another drink, Izzy.
Ari.
Ari!
there are, like, 500 people here.
if you can't stand the sight of me, just ignore me.
can't stand the...
Hey, hey! I am trying to start over here, okay?
how am I supposed to do that if you keep popping up everywhere?
Izzy, I'm moving on with my life. You should do the same.
how can you be so blind? Look at this! This should've been us.
that's what you always wanted, ever since you were 16 years old.
that's what you always wanted with me.
you better get him out of here.
Oh, fuck.
I took you to your fucking prom! - No, no, no.
I took that bitch to her fucking prom!
come on. You sound like an asshole. - She's totally not worth it.
I know, I know. I'm so over that fucking girl.
I'll be back!
you're dancing. You're dancing. You're rocking the salsa beat.
come on. Hey.
what the hell did you do? - Nothing. He was fine until...
he's not fine. He's scared.
he's not scared.
is that why he's screaming, then, Chris?
he's screaming 'cause he saw you coming down the...
that's great.
why don't you just stay here and have a good time?
relax. I'll go change him.
give me a break.
Lisa. Wait up.
how much longer am I supposed to put up with this?
what are you drinking?
I'm trying to decide how drunk I want to be.
I think I'll go with a beer, please.
Yeah, could I have one, too? Thanks.
have we met before?
do I look familiar?
no.
okay, I'm Kim. - Michael.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
so, are you a friend of the groom's? - Since preschool, actually.
that's really cute. - Yeah. Blocks.
can you just excuse me?
hello.
Yeah, I'm coming. Right now.
Bye.
I'm with three friends that have wanted to leave since we got here.
would you wait? I'll be right back.
it's true.
every single one of my friends are married.
it's like they're all in a cult, and completely obsessed with me joining.
they're like, "If you don't get married soon, you'll be too old to have a baby."
guess what? I don't want to have a baby.
I certainly don't think I should be bullied into it just because I have a vagina.
I'm Ken. - Danielle.
isn't this fantastic?
Yeah. It's pretty crazy, huh?
it's like a little condominium or something.
Yeah.
mind if I...
Yeah, please.
so do you have a girlfriend?
Yeah.
a little hesitation there. Having a crisis, are we?
do I look like I'm having a crisis? - Everyone I know is having a crisis.
I know you're not supposed to get them until mid-life, but
I think something's happened to our metabolisms.
our metabolisms?
Yeah, I mean, the world is moving so fast now and we're all chasing something so fast that we start freaking out way before our parents did.
feel my heart.
feel how fast it is?
that's a fast heart.
because we don't ever stop to breathe anymore.
you gotta remember to breathe, or you'll die.
Oh, sorry.
Hey! - Hey.
have you seen Michael anywhere?
no.
okay. Carry on.
and don't worry, because crises...
Crisises?
I think it's "crises." Go with "crises."
right. Like I said, crises, well, they come and go.
sometimes.
sometimes they don't really feel like they're going anywhere.
you're having a permanent crisis? - I don't know. Maybe.
I've just been thinking about my life lately and everything feels pretty planned out.
you know?
it's like I know everything that's going to happen.
there are no more surprises.
that is so boring. - I know.
so what do you do? - Complain, I guess.
no, like, what do you... Like, what do you do?
Oh, you mean "what do I do" ?
Yeah. - Sorry. I'm an architect.
how about you?
I'm a musician. - Oh, cool.
a flautist. - Oh, real cool.
Yeah. I mean, I study other things, too. I'm not an idiot.
but, if I could do anything, I would love to be able to do that when I finish school.
you're graduating this year?
two more years. Wow. Look at you. Two more years.
Yeah.
well, don't rush it. College was the best time of my life.
reminiscing already, huh?
I should get back.
to your crisis? - My crisis awaits.
shall we? - Yeah.
okay.
careful. I'll help you up.
are you okay? - Yeah.
yeah?
I guess that's a cool tree, huh? - Yeah, I like that tree.
all right, well, there are my friends, so I guess I'll see you around?
Yeah. Cool.
cool.
do you, like, want my phone number or something?
Yeah. That'd be good.
yeah?
do you have a pen?
no.
well, if you want to come by campus sometime,
I get out at 5: 00 on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays.
I usually meet my friends at the Terrace.
sure.
okay.
Bye.
look at her.
six weeks, and she's already screwing somebody else.
dude, ease up. He's obviously gay.
what? - He's gay.
look at him. No straight man looks that good.
you think?
Yeah. I mean, you know, he doesn't look that good to me, but he looks good.
caught you! You've been hiding from me.
no, I've been right here the whole time.
don't worry. You missed her throwing the garter belt.
did you see how beautiful Lisa's baby is?
he's beautiful.
you know, I thought I wanted a girl, but now I think I want a boy.
what do you want? - A girl.
me, too.
okay, so why are you staring at me?
what would you do if I died?
iron my dark suit.
would you even notice if I was gone?
trust me. I'd notice.
so, you'd do what?
go out and get some young thing that would sit here in silence and smile?
do you have anybody in mind?
you know, the other day I actually felt jealous of my own daughter?
do you know why? - I'm sure you're going to tell me.
the way Michael looked at her.
did you see that?
Anna, there is no point... - Like he had to have her.
just once I would like to know what that's like. Just once.
well, I do have to have you, darling.
it's a contractual thing.
go ahead, crack another joke.
Jesus.
Oh, look.
our bed just got more comfortable.
Chris!
Chris, what the hell are you doing? You've been in there for 20 minutes!
just give me one minute. - No! I have given you 20!
now get out here and give me a hand!
Matthew is screaming, I have piss all over me and I can't find any binkies.
who is it? - It's Marvin from next door.
your front porch is on fire!
Hey. No, don't say anything. - Get out.
I'm going crazy without you. I love you.
I'm serious. - I fucking love you.
come on, look at you. You're so beautiful.
I'm calling the police, that's what I'm doing.
no, no, you're not.
give me the phone! - No!
give me the phone! - No!
just listen to me for a second!
look me in the eye and tell me that you don't love me anymore.
I don't love you anymore.
I refuse to accept that. - Izzy, go home!
you really want me to leave? - Yes!
that's what you're saying? - That's what I'm saying.
okay.
Ari, I love you forever.
it's me. Open up.
I'm coming!
you have to come with me. - Where?
south America.
okay.
I need a wingman, man. I can't do this alone.
Yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Really? - Yeah.
Hey, you got any ice? I think I broke my hand.
you're not gonna believe this, Izzy, but I actually keep ice in the freezer.
you're really coming with me?
no talking!
during this trimester, "women have to carefully inspect the things they're feeling "because hormonal changes can make upsets and worries "seem larger than they are.
tell me about it.
no, that's my nut.
in isolation, one's anxieties become disproportionate.
talking things out with your partner "is a way of exorcising fears on both sides "or at least not allowing them to become overwhelming.
did you get that?
it says you can't hold everything inside.
Yeah. So what about you?
what? - What are you holding inside you feel like you want to let out?
what?
what? You asked! - Oh, my God!
I've been holding that in all day! - You're disgusting! Michael!
I don't want your farts on me.
come on, turn the TV off. I'm serious.
I want to know what you're feeling.
I'm feeling that...
what I'm feeling, me, is that, in general...
Wow. You are an enormous loser, you know that?
well, you're in love with a loser, and only a loser could love a loser.
are you nine? - Ten.
okay, fine. I'll go.
I feel like we should buy a house.
you got to be fucking kidding me.
I'll get it!
Hi. - Hi.
what are you doing here?
Kenny's coming with me to South America.
you're really serious about that?
hell, yes.
I should go with you. - Yeah, right.
Lisa's driving me out of my fucking mind. I can't take it anymore.
Where's Kenny? - He's...
you just got another promotion and my parents can help with the down payment.
I just don't think it's such a good idea.
Why? Their parents did it for them.
and you know, a monthly mortgage payment probably isn't that much more than we're spending on rent.
it's not really about the money, Jenna.
then what is it? I wouldn't dare mention the M-word because I know how any conversation about that totally freaks you out.
I told you I'd marry you when you could name three couples you know personally that have lasted more than five years.
Yeah, and I still only have my parents and that cute couple from the pond.
ducks don't count. - They mate for life, come on.
what is it, baby?
what are you afraid of?
I don't know. It just seems so, like, final.
final.
Wow. We're about to become a family, Michael.
I know. I didn't mean it like that.
if you aren't up for this, tell me now, - because otherwise, what are we doing? - I am! I'm excited!
no one forced you into this.
you had the chance to tell me in the beginning!
will you calm down? Your hormones are freaking out.
Oh, my God! Don't blame this on my hormones.
you couldn't get more obvious.
I'm saying what your magazine said, and we're doing it.
doing what? - We're talking about how we feel.
you're right. - What?
I'm sorry, I couldn't... I'm all the way over here.
I couldn't hear you very well. What'd you say?
I said you were right.
Oh, I'm right.
am I right?
you want to make a home with me, right?
Yes.
because if you don't, that's fine. - Look at me.
I do.
good. Because if you didn't, I'd have to kill you in your sleep.
and that would just ruin everything. - Yeah, that would suck.
I love you.
I love you.
I'm sorry.
she just makes everything impossible, man.
it's like anything I try to do makes her feel like she's losing control of the baby.
Yeah.
Hey. What's up?
nothing at the moment.
are you going with Izzy?
where? - To South America.
Oh, yeah. No.
what? You just said you were coming.
I know, buddy, but my life is perfect here.
why would I leave? Come on.
Hi. I'm Danielle.
see what I mean?
Hi, I'm Chris.
Hi. - We met at the wedding.
Yeah, hi. Yeah, we met at the wedding.
wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm going to stop for a second here.
excuse me, how is your life here so perfect?
can you just run that by me?
because I remember when you graduated, you were gonna go save the Africans.
save the children?
whatever. You were gonna go save them.
and now you're tending bar and you're screwing a different girl every other night?
what's funny about that is you're at that bar more than I am.
and secondly, dude, I'm not screwing a different girl every other night.
I'm just not.
okay, you're right. It's every night.
you're an asshole. - What? It's better that she knows now.
it's better you know now.
he does what he wants, I do what I want.
Jesus, do you hear that? She's perfect.
you're perfect. I'm in love with you.
do you have a sister for him, maybe?
Yeah, I'm very happy for both of you, but I'm offering you an opportunity here, and you're gonna miss it, you're gonna blow it.
take a risk. Take a chance. That's what you used to tell me.
when are we gonna get a chance to do this again?
when we're 50, on, like, some Norwegian Cruise with these fat girls in floaties.
I'm telling you, you're 29 years old, Kenny.
I'm 28. - No, you're 29.
thank you.
shit, I am.
well, you're gonna be sitting in that same chair in 20 years and you're gonna be wondering, "Why didn't I take this chance with Izzy?
why didn't I do something exciting with my life instead of ice-fishing on Lake Mendota?
see, what you're not getting, Izzy, is that I like ice-fishing.
ice-fishing makes me happy. It does.
and don't come in here and start editing my life just 'cause you're not happy with yours. Don't do it.
no, that's what you're doing.
no, I was...
wait, where you going? - I am going to put my blue balls to bed.
good night.
where are we? What the hell is going on? The dust has only just begun to form. Crop circles in the carpet, sinking, feeling. Spin me round again and rub my eyes.
good night.
this can't be happening. When busy streets a mess with people would stop to hold their heads heavy.
good night.
hide and seek - Night. - Good night.
I love you. - Me, too, you.
hide and seek.
so I was just thinking that if we move the garage from where it currently sits, there's no reason why this atrium couldn't be pulled up the entire height of the building.
so that way, it's the middle of winter, and all these people get to look out their window and see trees and maybe even birds.
what sorts of birds? - Shut up, Ryan.
like, what species... - Shut up, Ryan.
sorry. - Dick.
that's really interesting, Michael. - Thank you.
I'm just a little concerned about cost.
what do you think, Chris?
I think I'm going to leave my wife.
so, have you told her yet? - No, not yet.
I don't know how I'm going to do that, but...
I just know that I'm tired of being told how much I suck.
Oh, man.
I thought if I had a kid with her, it would bring us closer together.
not make us want to kill each other.
I'm trapped, Mike.
I'm fucking trapped.
Hey. - Hey.
it's so funny, I was...
I was driving by and I remembered that you said you hang out here.
drive by here often?
thinking of becoming a flautist. - Nice.
I hear this is the place. - Yeah. It's pretty good.
so you weren't coming here to see me?
I had a meeting.
do you want a ride? I have a car. - I live really close.
I'll take you.
Oh, no. Honestly, it's, like, really close. - I'll take you. I'll take you. Come on.
okay.
well, it's good to see you. - It's good to see you, too.
so, where am I going? - Straight ahead.
so, what did you do after I left the wedding?
just, you know, hung out with my friends and stuff.
don't you love weddings?
actually, no. They make me pretty depressed.
Why? - I don't know. They just...
they always seem so forced to me, you know?
I mean, if you love somebody, why do you need a photo album of drunk people in tuxedos to prove it?
Wow. How do you really feel?
did you know that when the institution of marriage was created, people only lived to be 30 years old?
I'd be dying next year.
I would wear the hottest dress to your funeral.
I live here. - Oh, here?
okay. - Yeah.
you do live close. - I told you.
so, that whole day was like a nightmare for you, huh?
all those relationships dissolving before your eyes.
well, it wasn't completely awful.
what are you doing for the long weekend?
I mean, almost all my friends are going out of town.
I don't know. I just was going to...
I don't know.
do you want to go to a party with me?
sure.
yeah? - Yeah.
okay, cool.
here. Let me give you this.
nice pen. - Thanks. I like purple.
don't even think about standing me up. - Okay.
all right.
Bye. - See you.
Hey! - Where are you?
I called the office. They said you weren't there.
I'm just on my way home. Why? What's going on?
we have a sonogram. Did you forget?
Oh, my God. Jenna, I totally did. I'm sorry. When?
5: 45, Get here soon, We can still make it,
okay. I'll be there in 10 minutes.
what the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing?
what the fuck are you doing?
holy shit. You are unbelievable.
there's more where that came from.
I just want to know, where did I find you and how do I make more of you?
I have to go back to work. - No, no!
hang on.
what are you doing later?
you, hopefully.
okay.
be at my house at 8: 00.
and stay hungry.
Oh, my God.
now that I can see you, it's as if I never left.
Oh, my God, if you only knew, every day I've kicked myself.
I have, just, every single day thinking about you.
I thought of you, too. - Oh, yeah. Liar.
I am so happy to see you.
so why did you disappear? - You know why.
I couldn't control the way I felt about you. You know that.
you know. Listen. I thought if I could stop cold, and that's the only way I could do it, maybe I could save my marriage. Seriously.
did you save your marriage? - No.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. - Anna, Anna.
I'm married.
you are what? - With a two-month-old baby boy.
you can't be serious. - Yeah, I'm serious.
how old is your wife? - What's the difference?
tell me. How old is she? - No, it doesn't matter.
tell me! How old is she?
she's 35 years old.
my God, she could be my daughter. - What's the difference?
you were never going to leave him, anyway.
be happy.
Anna.
God damn it, Anna!
is he here? - Yes.
but he's with a patient.
Hello, dear.
Anna, what's wrong? - Nothing, as far as you're concerned.
well, if you come back in 40 minutes...
I just wanted to let you know I fucked another man.
nice to see you.
excuse me.
Anna, just...
just come with me in here.
Oh, now you react.
maybe if you'd dragged me into a closet before, this wouldn't have happened.
what the hell is going on? - It was three years ago.
I saw him today.
he's leaving his wife and he's going to run away with me.
that's all you need to know.
Anna, I understand you want to lash out...
just shut up!
would you just, please, for God's sake, shut up? I don't want to talk this out.
and I do not want your understanding.
I want someone who's flesh and blood.
and since you're not that, I don't want you.
...fingers. - You're obsessed.
hello. - I've left your father,
what happened?
nothing happened. That's why I'm leaving him.
what? Mom, - Honey, I want you to know that, that I'm so happy for you and the baby, and I'm not jealous of you.
and if you need me, you call me, all right?
I love you. I love you.
what's going on?
it's Jenna. Is he there?
and then, the mattress transforms into this giant bundt cake.
I'm really sorry to interrupt, but your daughter's on the phone and she does say it's urgent.
okay.
excuse me for one minute.
she told me she's moving out. What the hell is going on, Dad?
sweetheart, your mother's going through a very tough time.
don't make excuses for her, - I'm not.
you know, I'm just gonna come over there. This is silly.
Jenna, I'm fine.
it's something between your mother and me.
we'll work it out. We always do.
right now, I want you to look after yourself, okay?
okay.
you sure you don't want a little company?
trust me, my current patient is company enough.
okay.
okay, sweetheart, I have to go back to work now, - Daddy? - Yeah?
it's a girl.
we're having a baby girl,
say something,
I'm...
I'm so happy.
I got to go now, sweetheart.
okay?
okay.
I'll see you later. I love you.
I love you.
hold that thought.
your timing's perfect.
my folks just dropped by. I want you to meet them.
what?
Joey. - What up, Ken?
I'm going with you.
you're full of shit.
I'm serious, man. When do we leave? - Dude, don't fuck with me.
I'm not. You're right.
if we don't leave Wisconsin now, we never will.
besides, without me, you'll never get laid.
are you serious? - I'm serious.
you're serious. - I'm serious.
you got any cash? - $5, 000.
you? - $700.
and a fuckload of cheese. - To cheese.
hello. - Are you going to be much longer?
probably not, no.
could you just come home now, please?
I just need a few minutes. Matthew has been fussy all day.
I think it's his stomach.
and I need some goat's milk,
okay, I'll be home soon.
Thanks,
okay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I can't stand us being like this at each other all the time.
we have to try harder, okay?
I'm gonna try a lot harder.
I can't.
what?
it's no good, Lise. This isn't working.
what are you talking about?
look, we have to admit it.
this is destroying us and it's gonna destroy Matty.
who is it?
who? - What's her name?
what? No, that's not what I'm talking about.
what exactly are you talking about, Chris?
I'm talking about trying...
I'm talking about trying to do this apart, for a little while at least.
to do what? To raise a child?
to build a family? What, Chris?
no, I'm trying to understand what the fuck you're saying here.
or haven't you even really thought about that?
shit.
of course I've thought about it.
it's all I think about!
Really? - Yeah.
or have you just thought about yourself?
do you think that this is good for him?
that kid is gonna hate us if he has to grow up listening to us fight all day long.
so that's it, then.
what about me?
am I just so easy to walk away from? - Lisa, I love you.
don't you fucking say that to me! You have no idea what love is, Chris!
Lisa. Listen.
we have a problem and we have to face it.
Oh, you're right, Chris. You are absolutely right.
get the fuck out, you fucking asshole!
you know what? If you want to go, go.
I release you. Go be free.
but don't you ever expect to see me or your child ever again, ever!
Lisa, stop it. Jesus, stop it.
just go. Please. Go.
you're staying at a motel? - No, it's a hotel.
and it's really very nice. They've got a gym...
come on, Mom. Please. This is ridiculous.
it's what I chose to do. I'm going to find a place soon.
and you really think you can start over? - You mean at my age?
Yes, yes I do. - I'm still breathing, aren't I?
I'm still here.
it's a long time ago. Daddy'll understand.
no, that's... That's not the point of this.
you've been together since college.
Yup.
and do you know how miserable I've been almost the whole time?
I don't think that's true. - Well, I've just kept it from you.
Yeah, trust me, Mom, you're not that good at hiding your emotions.
Really?
I'm sorry. You make this difficult because you want it that way.
men are easy.
and you've been with Michael, what, - three years, right? - Yeah.
and it took me less than half an hour to figure him out.
Wow. Oh, you're lucky. Jeez. - Mom.
you know exactly what Daddy wants.
and you know how to make him happy and how to make him miserable.
every woman does.
if you're bored, Mom, you know, that's your fault, not his.
bored.
you've always been your father's daughter, and if you want to side with him this time, that's fine.
this is not about sides, Mom. - Don't!
don't pretend that you know what goes into a 30-year marriage, because you don't have a clue.
you don't have a clue.
are you all right? I'm sorry. I don't want to upset you.
can we have some chamomile tea, please?
Hello, - Hey, it's Michael.
Hey, Michael! I've been thinking about you,
Really? What kind of thoughts?
you know exactly what kind of thoughts.
what are you doing? - I'm at work.
Yeah, I'm trying to picture it. Where's your office?
it's Zander-Cohen, it's a pretty big architecture firm.
impressive, Do you have a view?
Yeah. It's a nice view.
yeah? Can you see what I'm doing?
it's not that nice.
are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm sorry.
so are we still on for tonight?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
so, like, 8: 00, right? You want me to pick you up?
Yeah, 8: 00. I'll be waiting.
all right, cool. Bye.
who was that?
just this friend.
do you have a friend I don't know?
this guy from school. Going through a divorce.
by the way, I was going to ask you a favor.
what?
I was gonna go out with him tonight and Jenna fucking hates him, so I'm just gonna tell her I'm with you, if that's cool.
you're fucking around on her.
what?
it's a guy from school.
no. Don't get me involved in this, please.
how can you fuck around on Jenna? She's perfect.
she's beautiful. She's like a guy.
what more could you ask for?
I'm telling her I'm with you. - No. Michael, what are you doing?
don't tell her you're out with me. No, I'm gonna screw it up. I can't lie.
you're both gonna hate me forever. Leave me out of it.
I have faith in you. - No. Come here. Michael. Come here.
Michael, Michael.
Hey, Michael, come here a second.
my boss said to tell you that there's this guy who really wants to buy this thing coming by tomorrow.
but he is full of shit.
I mean, I've worked here for three years.
you're the first people I ever showed it to.
smoked a lot of weed in there, though. It's good for that.
hello. - Izzy, your father, he isn't breathing,
you need to get home quickly,
okay.
I called the ambulance and the fire volunteers, I gotta go.
Chris is moving into Kenny's?
I think so, so they can, like, figure some stuff out.
I don't get it. He has a child.
I know, but, come on, you've seen them together.
she's sort of lost her mind.
this is her fault? - It's nobody's fault. It's just...
I don't know. I think he just needs to talk to somebody.
okay. - I'm not gonna be late.
I'll be at my dad's till around 11: 00. - Okay.
God, what's happening? Everyone around us is falling apart.
I know.
have fun. - Thanks.
Hi! - I got this!
I don't need it!
Oh, my God! - My God!
Oh, my God. My top is totally clinging.
you can see everything.
don't worry, I promise I won't look.
then I'll be insulted.
well, I don't want to offend you. - Well, then.
your top's wet.
okay. Where am I going?
straight ahead. Turn left.
your kind of party, huh?
I was never in a fraternity. I was much too serious.
I bet you were 29 even when you were 19.
put it this way. If I had to do it again,
I'd do it knowing that after you graduate, no one ever gives a fuck what your GPA was.
Hey! Kim!
Hi!
this is Sara, and Bridgitte and John.
Hey. How's it going? - Cool.
sorry about that.
at the tone, please record your message,
Chris, it's Jenna. Michael and you both have your cell phones off.
listen, Izzy's dad just died.
we're all gonna head over there, so I guess I'll see you guys there. Bye.
go ahead. I'll be okay.
I want things to be okay, Daddy. - I know.
go ahead. Take care of your friend.
I'm fine. I really am.
you have no messages, Main menu, - Hey. - Hello, Jenna.
I'm so sorry. - Thank you, darling.
thank you.
thank you for coming. Go. Everybody is in the back room.
okay. - Thank you.
Hey. Thanks for coming.
I don't know what to say. Are you okay? - No. I don't know.
the last thing I did was quit on him.
he knew you loved him.
Hey. - Hey.
Hey, where's Michael?
he went out with Chris. I haven't been able to reach them.
no, Chris is in the kitchen.
good. I'll be back. - Okay.
Hey.
Michael's not here. - Why not?
I don't know. Did you try him at home?
Hi, you've reached Michael and Jenna,
Hey, he's not there and his cell's still turned off.
you told him you were coming here. He knows, right?
I told him. Or, I mean...
what? Did you?
Oh, man. I'm not gonna do this.
I can't do this. - Do what?
what's wrong? - Can't do what?
Chris? Chris, can't do what? - Jenna, please.
can't do what, Chris? - You should just talk to Michael.
talk to him about what, Chris?
what the hell are you talking about?
listen, don't ask me any more questions, please.
he should be telling you.
tell me what? - I don't know!
where is he? - I don't know!
who is he with right now? - I don't know!
is he seeing somebody?
why are you asking me? - Just tell me the truth.
is he seeing somebody else, Chris? Look at me!
I'm looking at you. I don't know if he's seeing anybody else.
you don't know. How could you not know?
I don't know anything.
Hey, This is Michael, - Leave a message, - What is with the yelling?
where did he go? - I don't know. Jenna!
Michael, call me as soon as you get this message. I'm gonna kill you.
Oh, my God! What the hell are you doing? You're calling him?
no, that wasn't him. - To tell him what? What is this?
what the fuck is this? - I honestly have no fucking idea.
Yes, you do. Do you know her? - Just give me a break.
no, I don't. - Do you know her?
No! They just met. Be quiet. - What?
Jenna, they're just... Listen to me. Whoa!
God, I'm gonna kill him!
come here. Jenna! Come here! Come here! Come here! Jenna!
they're just friends!
fuck!
you make me feel 10 years younger.
ten years? Then I'm seducing a younger man.
excellent.
you're trying to make me lose my mind, aren't you?
I've already lost mine.
come on.
let's go back to my room. My roommate's gone.
I can spend the whole night making love to you.
Oh, my God.
I can't. I can't. I gotta go. I gotta go.
no, you don't. - Yes, I do.
I gotta go. This isn't right.
Yeah, it is. - No, no, no. Kim, it isn't.
and I don't know what I thought was gonna happen tonight.
I definitely know what I hoped was gonna happen tonight.
but this isn't cool.
I really, really, really want to have sex with you.
Yeah. I can tell.
you can tell that? - Yeah.
subtle signs.
but I can't. I can't.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
okay.
it's gonna be okay.
he's gonna come home.
he's gonna come home.
he's gonna come home.
Hey, this is Michael,
do something for me.
what?
go home, tell her that it's over and leave her.
I can't. - What? You're an amazing guy.
you wouldn't be here with me right now unless you knew something was missing in your life.
you can't force things. I mean, relationships, they either work, or they don't.
I could be your last chance at happiness.
come inside.
I can't.
okay. Good night.
Jenna? - Where are you?
where are you?
No! No! No!
Oh, fuck!
Jenna, I had an accident. - You asshole!
I had a car accident!
who the fuck are you with, you bastard?
Jenna!
fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew this was gonna fucking happen.
I'm here. I'm here.
why would you lie to me, Michael?
what are you talking about?
what were you doing all night?
I was with Chris.
God, you lying bastard. You make me so sick.
I was with Chris, I swear.
it's him. You want to ask him? You can ask him. Chris?
Jenna knows everything, I didn't tell her,
Michael? Hello?
you don't want me to talk to him?
why, is that because you're a lying piece of shit?
I didn't do anything wrong, Jenna.
who is she?
what are you talking about? - I want to know who she is.
you're blowing this way out of proportion, baby.
who were you with, Michael?
this girl I met. It was nothing. It was nothing.
did you have sex with her?
tell me. Did you cheat on me, asshole?
I kissed her.
it was one kiss and it meant absolutely nothing, baby!
I did such a stupid thing!
it was a stupid thing. I'm so sorry. - You make me sick, you fucking slut.
slut?
Kim? You have her number programmed into your cell phone?
who is this dirty whore? - I didn't sleep with her!
who is this fucking whore? - I didn't sleep with her!
no. But you wanted to, right? - No!
bullshit. Is she prettier than me? - No!
liar! - No, Jen!
what am I supposed to do now, huh?
what the fuck am I supposed to do now?
you've ruined everything!
will you listen to me? Nothing happened!
nothing? You kissed her.
you were out with another woman all night. I'm pregnant.
is that fucking nothing to you? - Yes! No!
how many times did you kiss her? Don't you dare lie to me.
several times.
Oh, God, you make me sick!
but it didn't mean anything, baby. She made me realize I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I know that now.
I'm three months pregnant and you're already out trying to fuck other women!
what's gonna happen 10 years from now?
how could I ever trust anything you say again?
Jenna.
fuck you, man. It's over.
Jenna. - Get out right now.
I'll tell you when you can come back and get your shit.
maybe Kimmy can help you pack.
Jenna, we're having a baby. - No.
no, I am the one having this baby. I'm the pregnant one, not you.
and she's better off with no father than a lying asshole like you!
you're overreacting. It was a couple kisses.
after three years, Jenna, things happen.
not to me, they don't! Get out! - And go where?
get out of here! Go back to fucking Kim!
what, are you gonna fucking stab me, Jenna?
get out! - Are you out of your fucking mind?
get the fuck out of here! - Are you out of your fucking mind?
get the fuck out! - Fuck you! Fuck you!
hello. - Hey. Don't hang up.
look, I'm so sorry about before, I think,
God, I must've had too much to drink or something, but if I promise not to try to kiss you or anything, will you come over here and talk to me?
I really need to talk to you.
Anna?
Anna?
Hi. - Hey.
I promise I won't touch you.
Hey.
I don't care about tomorrow or anything else.
I just care that you're here.
fuck!
Oh, fuck!
why'd you leave without saying goodbye?
I have to go to this work thing. I didn't want to wake you up.
have you seen my keys?
you can't wait to get back to her, can you?
can you just please help me find my keys?
what did I do?
you didn't do anything, Kim. You're amazing.
you were amazing. Last night was perfect.
here.
thank you.
are you gonna call me?
I'll call you.
unlock the door, Jenna.
I'm packing. Come back later. The house will be empty.
no. You have to come talk to me. Things are not going to end like this.
like I did this. Move your foot. - I panicked. I made a huge mistake.
fuck!
Jenna, open the door!
Michael?
is anything wrong? - Everything's fine. I locked myself out.
Jenna, you're having our baby! - Yeah, well, maybe I won't keep it!
don't you ever say that, Jenna.
don't ever say anything like that ever again!
I can do whatever the hell I want. We're not married, remember?
we're both free, just like you wanted. - I made a mistake.
you're right. Too late, man. Move your goddamn foot.
Hi.
Hi, darling.
what's going on?
Jenna?
sweetheart.
Oh, honey.
sweetheart, what's the matter?
all right, come on. Come on, just come in.
Oh, sweetie. You'll be fine, sweetheart.
Jenna? - Hey, it's me.
hello. - Is she there?
Anna?
I'm coming over, Please don't tell her,
I know I'm being such a pain in the ass right now, but I had to come and see you.
Hi. - Hi.
I know you're like, "This girl's a freak, get her away from me,"
but I have something for you.
don't you want to know what it is?
I made you, like, the best mix CD ever. I mean, there's a ton of stuff on it.
like some really cool Madison bands that I'm sure you've never heard of before.
and, like, the first song that we danced to.
and there's also, like, this song of me playing the flute which you're gonna think is totally God-awful. But I thought it'd...
Kim. - What?
there's something I have to tell you.
I'm having a baby with a woman that I'm very much in love with.
you told me that you were confused, that you wanted to leave her.
I know. I was confused, Kim. I was so confused.
and it was wrong of me to get you tangled up in that.
how could you not tell me that you were having a baby?
because I'm an asshole. I did a bad thing.
I have no excuse.
there nothing I can say to you other than that I'm so sorry, and it's really not about you at all.
why do people always say that?
how can it not be about me if you can sleep with me one minute, and then walk out on me the next?
I'm sorry, Kim.
I gotta go.
all right. - All right.
no, you'll be fine.
you are the suckiest driver.
no way. I'm not.
well, how many miles do you think you guys will be making fun of me for?
I'd say pretty much the whole entire way.
I'm not going to make fun of you.
I think there's a bus stop...
is there a bus down there? Oh, good. - It's four miles.
because my friends aren't giving me a ride home, so...
I think it's going to rain.
sorry I'm not coming, guys.
no, don't apologize. - No. You're doing the right thing, man.
send a postcard? - Sure.
call me.
fly's down.
honey.
Michael's coming over.
you told him I was here? - He knew.
come on, Mom.
Jenna, sweetheart, look, I know. I know it hurts like hell and I am sorry, I really am.
but you know, two days ago you told me these things happen...
you and Daddy have been together 30 years, Mom.
we aren't even married yet and he's already cheating on me.
I know. I know.
and I really don't need you to defend him right now, okay?
I'm not. There's nothing to defend. It's despicable. He did an awful thing.
it's not an awful thing, Mom. It's an unforgivable thing.
unforgivable?
what do you want?
I just want to talk to you! - Get out of here! It's over!
Jenna? - You hear me? It's over!
so what are we supposed to do? - Let him in.
thank you.
no, wait. Let me talk to her again.
Jenna. Open up.
Michael's not here. He's outside with your dad.
Jenna.
have you got something to say for yourself?
I don't know, I'm... I panicked. I got scared.
well, that's a very compelling argument.
you won't have any trouble convincing her of that.
what the fuck were you thinking?
did you just get bored?
no, I'm just an idiot. - On that much, we're agreed.
I love her, Stephen.
I realize now I love her more than I will ever love anybody else.
stop talking about love.
every asshole in the world says he loves somebody.
it means nothing. - But it's true.
it still doesn't mean anything.
what you feel only matters to you.
it's what you do to the people you say you love, that's what matters.
it's the only thing that counts.
and you did do this thing, right?
I just saw the rest of my life, and there were no more surprises.
this was it.
I mean, it was great...
but it was it.
what makes you think this isn't gonna happen again?
I know it won't. - Oh, right.
come on!
aren't we supposed to be able to learn from our mistakes?
I did something horrible, but I learned from it.
I met this little brunette and I faltered.
are you telling me that throughout your entire marriage you never faltered?
you haven't?
never?
never. - Oh, that makes me feel great.
you think it's because I wasn't tempted?
you think that this woman is the last brunette that's ever gonna let you know that she wants you?
look at me. I haven't met my last brunette.
she's the last one I'm gonna kiss.
I'm in love with your daughter, Stephen.
and maybe that doesn't mean anything to you, but I'm standing here.
you're her father. I'm looking you in the eyes and I'm telling you,
I will do anything in the world to get your daughter back.
Really? Anything? - I'll do anything.
people say that. They don't mean it. - But I mean it.
well, it's very simple.
just do whatever it takes.
it's that simple. - Yes.
you can't fail if you don't give up.
you know, being right isn't all it's cracked up to be.
and you can't try so hard to control it all.
you know, life is pretty much in the grays for the most part.
and if you insist always on black and white, you are gonna be very unhappy.
that's a convenient philosophy for you, Mom.
look, I don't defend what I did to your father.
but the truth of the matter is that we both gave up.
but now we are trying, we are trying very hard to get back on track by listening to each other, something we've never done.
honey, whatever you decide about Michael, talk to him.
as painful as it is.
don't be so quick to walk away.
she's in her room.
people know the truth.
they may not like it or want to know it, but they always know.
lie, and you will lose her.
it'll never happen again in my life. I promise.
why did you do something so awful to me?
because I was scared.
do you know what? I don't want to hear it.
you said you're okay with having this baby.
what am I supposed to say to you, Jenna?
I'm terrified that my life is over?
I'm terrified because I don't think I'm ready to grow up yet?
I mean, a guy can't say that to the woman that's having his baby.
you would've never forgiven me. - No, you're right, and I don't.
that doesn't mean I feel that way now, though.
no, now you feel guilty. You're still scared.
you're just scared of what I'll do to you.
well, that's true.
you were really terrified? - Jenna, I am terrified.
so am I, you idiot.
I'm scared I'm gonna be a bad mother, and you won't love me, and you'll ignore me, and...
I won't want you, and the whole thing will fall apart and I won't know what to do.
baby, that's not gonna happen. - How do you know?
because I know.
you know now, you didn't know before? - Yes.
I know now.
were you telling me the truth last night?
you didn't sleep with her?
I was telling you the truth.
but then I went back.
fuck you!
Jenna. Calm down! Listen to me. I'm telling you the truth.
get the fuck out! - I'm telling you the truth!
get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!
I'm sorry! I'm trying to be totally honest with you!
Jenna, I could've lied and I'd be inside that door right now, but I didn't.
isn't the truth more important than anything else, Jenna?
not if the truth is you slept with another woman!
Jen?
just listen to me for one second. I'm so sorry.
baby, I'm so sorry. Jenna, please...
don't touch me! - Listen to me for one second.
I mean it! I mean it!
get... Get away from me!
where are you going to go, Jenna?
Jenna?
get away from me! - Listen to me!
Jenna?
stop! I love you!
motherfucker. - Jenna? Jenna?
don't even think about coming in the house. Michael, I mean it.
okay. I'm not gonna come inside. - Damn right, you're not.
but I'm not gonna leave, either.
I'm not gonna leave, Jenna.
you're gonna have to come talk to me sooner or later.
go away!
I can't! I'm sorry. I can't.
I love you, and I don't deserve you, but this is our home.
this is our home, Jenna, and I'm...
I'm not gonna leave this porch until you talk to me.
Jenna?
Hey.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sorry.
but I'm moving into Kenny's. I'm still gonna be his dad.
okay. Good.
Hey. - You can start now.
Hi.
sorry?
lise?
I'm exhausted, Chris. Everything you need is in here.
you need anything else, call. Otherwise, I will see you on Monday.
I'm here, kid.
I'll never leave you.
Michael? Michael?
it's sparkling! - Thank you, Réjean.
home
thank you.
do you remember the day my grandmother died?
Jenna?
remember how they let me in so that I could kiss her goodbye?
there was this pain in my heart that day that I had never felt before, and that I've never felt again until now.
I feel like I'm mourning the death of the single most important thing in my life.
us.
but we're not dead, Jenna.
we're not dead, baby. We just have to go back.
I'm begging you. I'm begging you.
please love me enough to let us go back to the way things were.
I don't think I can, Michael.
well, then, we'll start something new, but we have to try, right?
how can we not try?
Jenna?
Jenna?
here is the latest news.
the Prime Minister, who was to be the victim of the assasination, survived it and is no longer in danger.
the police have the portraits of the two assasins, but would not give us any information.
the LAST MISSION
screenplay
starring - He's late. - No, not yet.
we're famous. - Don't get excited.
we fucked it up. - Not at all.
11 cops... Bang!
we sent them to hell.
but the prime minister of this anti-Arabic country escaped.
we'll get him, brother.
music
director OF PHOTOGRAPHY
director - Here you are, Sir. - Thank you, Madame.
yes? - It's Tremiere.
this is my report.
everything's sorted.
great. Our efforts will make French tax-payers happy.
thank you, colonel.
I'll speak to you later. - Good bye, prefect.
good bye.
here it is.
that's the one?
it's much too big.
do I have any chance?
Statistically: Fifty-fifty.
and if I don't agree to be operated.
you'll get paralysed after a while and then you know.
how much time do I have?
an hour, six weeks, a year...
I'll let you know.
you'll need them, the attacks might be more often.
Bye.
ladies and gentlemen... I understand you're ready.
who's for?
thank you. Who's against?
mr Muran is here. - Ask him in.
please come in.
mr Muran...
the board have decided to exclude you.
the way you run your business...
has nothing to do with generally accepted ethics.
our decision is final.
Muran has laundered our money, hasn't given back the debt and he thinks everything's OK.
what do you suggest?
OK. How?
our colonel has the ideal candidate.
he speaks Polish and knows Warsaw.
I remember him.
he's very effective.
I agree.
so, it's all done.
Cortez is sending an assasin.
whom? - His name is Andre Costynowitz.
anything to frame him?
I think I have something.
go ahead!
the boss isn't happy that you talked to Muran.
I understand.
go!
come on, go!
shall we get something to eat? - Later.
sell all the shares.
And?
so. That's it.
no more leaks for Muran.
you know what you've got to do now.
of course. - So back to work.
I'm sorry.
good morning.
anything to drink? - No, thank you.
I have serious doubts.
also... I don't understand your father's role in all this.
my stepfather's.
Stepfather's... I don't want to clean up Pawel's mess.
I am asking for a loan. - I can't do that.
it's a lot of money.
even for the president of the biggest trust fund in Poland?
that's one of the reasons. - And privately?
it doesn't change anything. - Listen. The disco brings profits.
I am the best student at school. I'll rule the stock exchange.
in 2 years you'll get your money back.
in business facts count, not wishful thinking.
mum was wrong about you.
you've never been her friend.
yes?
excuse me.
yes madam, of course.
I will not come back.
good bye.
Andre, you're punctual as always.
good job in that warehouse.
water for me.
what are your chances?
like at war.
have a seat.
sit down.
here you are. - Thank you.
as you asked for...
these are... the Belgian papers.
and... this one just in case.
with the crown.
you'll never learn to speak proper French.
why two?
in case you need to change - Your identity. - Will I need to?
you never know.
our new friends have a job for you in Warsaw.
that's on order?
not at all.
just a proposition.
they're very generous.
And?
Hi, Farina.
did you accepted the Colonel's proposition?
none of your business. - Mysterious.
tell him to fuck off. - And arrogant.
calm down.
come to the Pub on Saturday, there will be a party.
good old guys. - I'm going to hunt bisons.
so bring some Zubrowka.
OK. the whole tank.
who's that
for whom?
for Monika.
I've seen the posters...
I would call you anyway.
problems at the university or heart problems?
fifty thousand dollars.
so much money?
I only wanted to see you, honestly.
but at least tell me.
just like your mother... it'll take time before you tell me.
you know... Just come to my place.
say it! - When I come to visit mum's grave.
OK. No more questions.
this guy outside is getting on my nerves.
stop it.
another lovebird?
no, that's my new employee. Very mysterious.
and he hasn't come to get the autograph?
I had a car crash and he's driving me.
and the previous one?
now... I have to be strong.
no thrills, no jasmine smells, no sighs.
I may have some money.
where can I send it to you? - I need it now.
forget it.
I have to go.
Bye.
what a coincidence...
what's up, Record?
relax... relax...
it's easy to slip up.
I'm relaxed and open to propositions.
the other day you threatened me with a war.
there was a guy of your's who liked fighting.
Bruno, what was his name? - Bonzo.
downtown is mine, this part is mine."
I nicely asked him: "I don't know the city.
tell me what's yours and I won't interfere."
and he started to threaten me. - He was too nervous.
exactly.
and he forgot to turn the gas off.
they say that a bomb exploded in his house.
do you believe it, Record?
I'm not Bonzo and you stay away from Mokotow, understand?
spoken like Bonzo.
record, if gas explodes in your house will everyone think it was a bomb?
and how about the school in Korotynski St?
you bastard...
your son goes there, right?
let's not involve children in it, OK?
forget Mokotow.
what about Pulawska St? Is that still Mokotow.
we don't know the city and we want no trouble...
OK. Pulawska is yours. But if you make a step forward...
you'll regret your mothers didn't get abortions.
asshole.
Bruno. - Yes?
you came back from Bosnia in one piece but if you try to get too big here, I'll make you smaller, understand?
why all these nerves?
grandpa! I've moved my queen from h3 to h8!
have you? And I'm beating your queen with my bishop.
go on, make holes.
kowal speaking. Is it all right to talk now?
Yes, go ahead. - We've got it.
I have both the pictures and the tape.
you were right. Gdansk amphetamine is beating the Warsaw one.
do you want it today? - Yes... hold on. Mateusz...
it's mum.
is there someone new? - Yes. Sztych has a new partner.
send it to me. I'm turning on my fax.
mum, I have a problem. - Grandpa, look at these holes.
so big holes.
what's going on here? Dad, you're spoiling them.
I have to spoil someone.
gosh, grandpa, you let me win.
grandpa, did you? - All right, I did.
are you pleased, Mr Minister?
it's only business but I admit I enjoy working with you.
I'll be supporting you as much as I can.
good night. - Thank you. Good night.
boss. - Wait in the living room.
care for a drink? - No, thank you.
don't you trust me any more?
not at all.
so?
boss, do you need all this? - What?
this. You've got plenty of dough already.
legal money, buddy. And this is for assholes.
what about our girl? Don't let her out of your sight.
you know, she's a nice girl.
be careful.
all right. Everything is under control.
damn it. Just a moment.
please come in. - Unfortunately it's me again.
good morning.
you and your bank are my nightmares.
I feel so sorry for you. - And what should I say?
unfortunately you'll have to move out.
you've got 10 days. You can leave your furniture here for a while.
please sign it here.
I've spent my whole life here.
I can't believe it.
this is the law.
where did I go wrong? - How shall I put it?
the 50000$ you got mortgaging your house have never supplied the account of the disco you run.
it's impossible! I pay rents, bills, salaries, - even my tuition fee! - That's right.
the business brings profits. Think about it.
you have a partner, don't you? I can't tell you more.
please sign it here.
don't sign anything.
I got the car back. It's all done.
what sort of money will stop the execution?
you've been listening. - Yes. I'm asking you how much?
10%/% could stop the whole thing for some time.
fill in the papers. - I don't want it.
don't worry, it's only a loan.
a receipt will do.
you have to go to the bank yourself.
I will.
and what were these nerves for?
fill in these papers.
who's that? - Pawel Gorski.
come in.
welcome, Vice-President.
here I am. What's the problem?
what did you hope for? That I'll never know?
where is the money from the bank? - Even though I was against it...
you invested in this disco.
everything you inherited from your mother.
and I later supported you, didn't I?
you're kidding. I needed real money.
you've got your house, your Lexus, accounts...
why this?
a young single person doesn't need such a big house.
this is my mother's house.
and I may want to have a family, didn't you think about this?
you're disgusting.
you were taking care of me for 20 years.
sometimes you were un faithful to my mother.
I never told her because loved her. I wanted to have a father.
it's a pity we have this conversation so late.
mother would have never believed you deceived me.
I failed, lost everything.
Marta left me so suddenly.
friends' phones are silent.
I'm finished.
baby... - You didn't have the right.
I'm sorry.
good bye.
may I come in?
is everything all right? - Of course.
if you want, I'll sort the guy out.
it's none of your business.
I'm strong.
great.
can I have the queen? - Of course.
not so great.
give it to me. - Can you see what it says?
I'll sign it. - No, in person.
come.
he insisted you have to sign it in person.
good evening. Are you Mr. Muran?
Yes. - It's from France.
please, sign it here.
thank you. Good night.
strange.
are you having some problems with Mafia?
so they scared Mr. Muran.
can you do me a favor?
we are alone. You can talk.
I think it's general's department. - The general is all ears.
this card isn't a joke.
the name of the problem is Andre Costynowitz.
are these your people?
which people? - Drug dealers.
they are everywhere.
what will you drink?
get rid of them.
why are you so nervous?
I'll call the cops.
OK. go ahead.
they won't get them anyway. And even if they do you'll lose your house, this disco and that will be it.
I'm fed up with you.
welcome. And the tickets?
go ahead. VIPs get in for free.
Bruno. You have guests. - Got it.
as we agreed Mokotow is ours.
if you say so. - You're out of here by tomorrow.
go on, Bruno! You've lost your guts?
watch out, you prick.
it hurts? - No problem.
see you.
police.
good evening. I'm calling from the Night Rhythm Club.
some scum have started shooting here.
street? - On the post.
clients are coming. - Over and out.
you certainly have nothing to do with all this.
of course not.
I hate violence. I hate lies. And you are lying.
we're all feathering our nests.
downtown is mine, this part is mine.
I nicely asked him: "I don't know the city.
tell me what's yours and I won't interfere."
he started to threaten me. - He was too nervous.
and he forgot to turn the gas off.
they say that a bomb exploded in his house.
do you believe it, Record? - I'm not Bonzo and you stay away from Mokotow, understand?
spoken like Bonzo. - Record, if gas explodes in your house will everyone think it was a bomb?
and what about the school in Korotynski St?
you bastard... - Well done.
forget Mokotow...
and Pulawska St? Is it also Mokotow?
good morning. - Welcome.
good morning. - May I?
Absolutly.
I'll get some coffe.
there is a job for you. - Really?
a priority. Still hot. From the Interpol.
Andre Costynowitz, or actually Kostynowicz.
escaped to France before the martial law. Arrest him.
on what charge?
Kostynowicz has orders to kill Jozef Muran.
Muran? But he's a gangster... a swindler.
we'll talk about swindles at Sunday dinner, but I can tell you that at the top.
they will support you - Really? Good for me.
listen...
I don't have tell you what his death could cause.
but you will, won't you? - The Stock Exchange crash.
6 of his companies are in top twenty.
I'm pleased with your patriotism. - What's your problem?
during the communism you were against but now?
now? I won't move up either.
but everything's fine chief.
keep an eye on Muran. Arrest Kostynowicz.
everything's clear.
see you, dad-in-law. - See you.
I ruined my liver in Vietnam. I don't like cinema...
but it's nice of you to remember.
I have a favor to ask.
business... fax.
fax is not a big deal.
you help us a lot. We know how to be grateful.
Oh, here it is.
arrested when he was 18.
he escaped abroad...
four years in Guyana...
the Foreign Legion. He's a professional killer.
and he does it for the French.
for their government.
1992 - the car of the Chad dictator got burnt.
lately two hamas were blown up.
it's a long list. What particularly are you interested in?
is there on this list...
does a Polish businessman Jozef Muran fit this list?
french security isn't paranoid.
personally... it's a private hunting.
if you want I'll find it out, OK?
thank you. Sir? Have a nice stay.
Mr. Myszkowski announced you.
inspector Myszkowski. He's my boss.
I am Sobczak - an officer.
what's the problem?
do you know someone called Costynowitz?
or Kostynowicz?
it helps a lot. I recommend it.
I don't know the guy.
does it matter? - For you it does.
this Kostynowicz is to blow your head off.
for good money. Pity, I don't know the amount.
you don't seem to be a fan of mine.
well... privately you're not my favorite.
they say you're a professional.
I think I am.
it's good news for me then - in my case.
what are you expecting from me?
co-operation.
you have to submit yourself to me.
I'll accompany you... everyday.
your body guards should co-operate with us.
I don't have time. - Almost ready.
you owe me a cognac.
so you fell off the wagon.
it's a minor case from August 1980.
they made a big deal out of it during the martial law.
that was the style.
Anna Konieczny, daughter of Jakub Konieczny
a composer known for his cosmopolitan beliefs, and of Felicja Bek, an active non-conformist.
here... She has an intimate relationship with a student from her class.
today she must be a big fish. - She died.
a natural death? - An accident.
four years ago. It was in the news.
it's a pity. She would be useful today.
Kostynowicz was treated nicely as well.
father not known, mother - a prostitute, was brought up by his grandfather.
under the influence of Konieczny his attitude towards the socialistic country becomes hostile.
it even says how they fucked.
secret agent Renata. It looks like she was the mattress.
their friend from the same class. - That's something.
can you find her for me?
it may take a while.
you can do it...
this will make the search faster.
do you speak French?
I need the key to the room of that guy that has just left.
I have to call the management. - It's not about a search.
we need fingerprints.
good morning. - Have a seat, please.
may I help you?
I've come to the secret agent Renata.
it was a long time ago.
and the system has changed in the meantime.
I'm not sure if this change was good for you.
I don't understand.
in our new system your diploma can be verified.
when you suddenly moved to the Wroclaw Academy?
may I come in?
not at the moment. I'll call you.
so you will talk or the Board will see your diploma issued by communists?
that's blackmail.
no, madam.
this is paying off the old scores.
ask your questions.
gladly.
Kostynowicz has a daughter here. He's never seen her.
And?
what would you do if you were him?
I would meet my daughter, kill Muran, and then disappear?
that's their style. - Very logical.
I'm going to the lab. You're not asking why?
your next star is very close. - All right. What's the story?
I think my people have located Kostynowicz. Bye.
copy these documents for me.
they're beautiful.
please, don't come here anymore.
the fact that you lent me money doesn't give you any rights.
we'll get this house back, Monika.
it won't be that difficult.
and it'll be ours, right?
let's make an agreement. - No way!
you have the club, I have my business.
and it's cool. - No.
I'm leaving. - Monika.
I'm waiting.
And? - Almost surely the same guy.
the same or not?
almost surely" is not enough to arrest a guy from EC.
the tests came.
see, inspector. Dactylography's the same.
almost surely? - Come on.
we're getting him.
he thanked as usual.
thank you, boys.
that's our client. He'll be getting.
excuse me.
I'm sorry.
he's not armed.
he's going towards you. Watch out.
good morning. Police. You're under arrest.
I don't understand Polish, I'm Belgian.
put it down.
3, 4. Do you read me, over?
handcuffs. - Three, four.
he's gone. Watch out, he'll try to get to his car.
he took the keys as well,
what a shame.
bastard took my gun. - Really?
what? Shit!
I thought, I could rely on you. I am speechless.
you can do whatever you want.
I don't care. But nothing can happen to Muran.
is that clear?
Yes, it is.
I guess you don't want to end up in a hole.
the most effective policeman in the whole city.
what do you mean?
you are taking over?
no offence, but you're getting old.
so, you're taking over?
Oh no...
that would be too easy. I'm actively joining you.
that sounds serious.
pardon? - Nothing. Talking to myself.
all right.
send me these eagles of yours. I'll talk to them.
Yes, sir.
these are the documents. Please sign here, Mr. Sikora.
is the tank full? - Certainly. Here, your keys.
have a nice trip. - Thanks.
Andre, how are you? - All right.
listen... Do you know who reported me to the Polish police?
if I only knew... - too bad, I thought you know.
Andre... - Yes?
take care of yourself. - I will.
Bye.
we are using all methods to keep the danger - away from you. - Make it clear.
Kostynowicz... unfortunately, he slipped out.
you're kidding? - We'll put you in a safe place.
and you'll run my business? - We'll get Kostynowicz.
we need a few days, maybe hours. - I'm staying here.
Mr. Muran... - the police...
I'm not taking your time any more.
did you hear?
I did.
so what are you waiting for?
you didn't listen to me.
again you're patronizing. What's wrong now?
your drug dealers worked here again.
that brings profits. I thought you'd understood.
so that's what you want.
I'm closing down the club right now. You got it?
you said everything already. Yesterday.
your troubles, honey, have just begun.
here you are.
all right, he's on the list.
are you there, buddy? Let's talk about your daughter.
I'm not your buddy. - But your name's Kostynowicz?
let's say it is. - So, listen carefully, now.
we have your daughter. Get closer to Muran and you won't see her again.
I'm calling your mobile, you know what it means.
I know. Long arms. - You see? You can think logically.
Muran... I know this name.
I hope so. And remember, stay away from Muran.
but Monika... If something...
we have your daughter.
get closer to Muran and you won't see her again.
attention! We are getting out.
start the engines.
go on, boys, go.
I don't need all that. Just a regular car.
don't make our job difficult.
that's annoying.
and it was you who let Costynowitz escape.
let's go!
pull down the curtains in the living room.
boss, can you see what I can see?
Wisniewski feels like at home there.
no kidding!
Mateusz has to be at school at 8: 00. Ewa before nine.
everything's in the bag.
did you hear me, Dad?
of course, honey. We'll manage.
any problems? - Exactly.
can I have a word with you?
give me the keys.
but you won't go. - I won't go anywhere.
where can I go without my granddaughter?
come on. They have secrets.
Mr. Muran has a gangster among his bodyguards.
what gangster? - Bruno Wisniewski...
he's a gangster.
I know what I'm talking about.
it's confidential. One leak to media and you're finished.
go now.
grandpa... - What's up?
it's broken... - We'll fix it, my sunshine.
there you go.
you won't tell us to go to bed at ten?
not at all.
black. You start.
are you sure? - Yes, sir.
Bruno Wisniewski works as a bodyguard for Muran.
please, have a seat.
our dear Mr. Muran is impudent.
a gangster works as a bodyguard for a prominent businessman.
can you imagine the headlines in newspapers?
well, I think I can.
some cognac?
I send them to get some beer.
you're trespassing. I can sue you.
yes... I'm looking for Monika Gorska.
you work for her. Is that right?
I'm also looking for her.
she fired me just overnight without any notice.
I should take her to court. - Listen to me carefully.
you have your drug dealers in half of Warsaw clubs and you threaten people with the court.
you want to complain against me.
what does this frowned forehead mean?
you threatened Record and he was killed.
Sztych was found dead.
what are you counting on, prick? On Muran?
he won't defend you.
do you know him?
I've seen him. Once. In front of Gorska's house.
finally you know something.
you'd better have nothing to do with her disappearance.
understand?
isn't it ironic that we're protecting such a scum.
attention, we're going out.
start the engines.
back to your positions.
look who's here.
so it's you they sent. - You refused.
put it away. - Are you crazy?
it's about my daughter's life.
you'll pay for that. - Hurry up!
who was shooting? - None of us.
please, move away!
we're waiting. Stay calm.
"Sako" - rolls-royce among snipers.
kowal speaking. Nowogrodzka and Krucza.
send us a crew and some support.
what? No.
he fell off the roof. His face is smashed.
few shots and a guy with "Sako" fell off the roof.
it's a good opportunity to remove bodyguards from Muran.
pardon? - What, can't you hear?
I can. Understood.
can you get off, please?
you're relieved.
now you can drive your own car. - What's happened?
I've got the order to send the guards away. Good day.
there can be others. - Quite possible.
come on. - OK.
boss.
here.
I'm back.
Costynowitz is dead. - Already?
I thought he was a pro. - Get rid of the girl.
we don't want any loose ends.
what? Do you want to say that in Bosnia you were helping children to cross the street.
that's not enough.
it's our department that is responsible for protecting you...
it's a very delicate matter.
the public opinion shouldn't know that this kind of people...
general... it's bullshit!
"public opinion," "this kind of people."
what are you taking about?
to be precise. Our arrangements are not valid until you fire this Wisniewski.
to be precise, general...
this is a video recording of some financial transactions.
you are there and so is you boss. Have a look at this.
and I want the guards back.
not because I need them but because that's what I want.
can you give me a lift to the city?
son of a bitch. He got us.
tomorrow he'll have his guards back.
then we'll think.
easy.
nothing has happened yet.
I'll find her.
do you know what it means?
I'll get out on bail but you'll rot in jail.
I'll get her. Only... I can't yet.
who did this to you?
was the bitch here? - She left about an hour ago.
I'll beat the shit out of her! - Bruno will get his hands dirty.
why, the fuck, are you laughing?
easy... easy...
what?
she talked to someone on the phone and left.
anybody used the phone after her? - What for?
wash yourself.
yes?
excuse me, is this a Warsaw number?
wrong number. - And could you...
what area code is 081?
Kazimierz Dolny. - Thank you.
what?
are you there, buddy?
let's talk about your daughter.
let's talk, then.
where is Monika?
it hurts?
it'll stop soon. - She escaped.
you want me to buy that? - So kill me...
don't try to look for her.
yes? - It's me.
Muran has been killed.
Jesus... the police will find out.
I've sent my two best people there.
take one more photo.
is anyone checking there? - Yes.
9 mm. - All right.
sorry, it's been so long.
Costynowitz has a serious brain cancer.
I thought so. Now I'm sure. Thanks, David.
and when will you come to play chess?
as soon as I can, of course.
good evening. State Security Office, Lieutenant Ryniewicz.
can we have a look around? - Certainly.
you will secure the safe? - Absolutely.
Yes, that's him. He had a strange accent.
his name's... Asked for a big car.
and got a new toledo. - He's wanted.
we can localize him. - Do you employ a fortune teller?
there's a GPS in the car.
excuse me, a customer's waiting.
good evening, inspector.
detective Sobczak is there.
have a seat.
what is this?
we're finished.
we've gotta find them.
and what will you do with that?
me? I should have been retired for half a year.
the problem is what you'll do with that.
Bye.
it's Kowal.
Kostynowicz rented a new toledo using a name Sikora.
you informed the traffic police? - No, but I'm locating him.
don't fuck with me, I'm tired. - There is a GPS in the car.
you're lucky. - Doing my best.
Where's he? - Driving towards Pulawy.
I'll get there by a helicopter. - All right.
who's that? - Open, guru.
Andrzej?
come in.
don't worry. I know him.
I'd better leave you alone.
say that again.
I'm your father.
get out of here. - Monika, please...
I don't have a father. - Listen. After all...
I don't want to see you!
get out of here! - Let me at least explain.
what for?
my whole life... I didn't exist for you.
I was no one.
I didn't have a choice. - For so many years?
like I said...
I don't have a father.
you have to listen to me. - I don't!
I'm a grown up!
it doesn't matter!
life isn't as easy as you think.
it's not always the way we like it.
sometimes you are forced to make decisions.
and then there's no way back, understand? No way out!
I never forgot I had a daughter.
and now...
you want to be a part of my life?
you want to be my... dad?
Yes.
if you came back here after so many years and found her it means that either you had a revelation or you have a terminal disease....
I suspect the latter one, though.
that's why you always were a guru for us.
what is she doing there? - She wants to grasp it.
I'm going for a walk.
no way.
I won't let you out without a breakfast.
good morning, dad. He's in a horrible mood.
wait a second.
dad wants to talk to you.
I'm not going to talk to any one. Get out.
get out.
all right.
dad, are you there? - Yes.
he doesn't want to talk. What did you do to him?
he's getting nuts.
one day he'll tell you himself. - You're both nuts.
Bye.
I was sending letters to Ania but all came back.
addressee unknown.
in 1983 your grandpa had concerts in Paris...
he told me about you, that Gorski gave you his last name and that your mum had a new life.
I had nothing to come back to.
is Ania buried here?
Yes.
will you take me there? - Yes.
I miss her a lot.
when she got killed in this accident
I didn't know what to do.
you're 16 and...
two years later I learnt... that you'd left me a fortune.
when I found out about you I opened an account.
it was the least I could do.
I was looking for you.
and then I hit him with that lamp. But he wanted to kill me.
first I thought he was in love with me.
I must have a bump on the head. - Where?
where do you have the bump? - It's only a saying, silly.
I'm sorry.
you have to teach me all these sayings.
I understand you'll have time for it.
wait. I'll be back in a second.
that's for you.
the one I owe you.
I'm here boss and I got him. - Where exactly?
all right, Kowal. Well done.
I'll take care of the rest.
and what color is that toledo? - Navy blue.
why do you call Stefan a guru?
he taught us how to think logically. How to be free.
like a real guru.
this phone's getting on my nerves. Tag.
take your hands out of your pockets. Slowly.
wanna know the truth?
so? You're disgusted with me?
and how do you like your daddy?
we're not very different.
I didn't meet you in Bosnia.
you must have been killing somewhere else.
what are you looking at?
your daddy's a hit man just like me.
how many did you kill? 20? 50... 100? Speak!
put down your gun and leave, and I won't hurt you.
fuck, you must be mad.
who's gonna be first?
her, the old geezer, or you?
you're a guest, choose.
him.
you're the boss.
I told you not to look for her.
drop your gun.
police. The gun.
you're under arrest.
is it true what he said? - Yes.
so that's your profession. - How could I tell you this? How?
passport.
Mr. Sikora.
leave Poland. Immediately. The nearest way through Slovakia.
you fell off the roof. You're dead.
that's all I can do for you, Mr. Kostynowicz.
and it's a pity you didn't kill that bastard.
undoubtedly it is connected with murder
we don't know yet if there is any connection
half A YEAR LATER
archers, hold!
king Galenus of Argos! Show yourself!
my sword against yours. Victor takes all!
this city, or mine, this army, riches... subjects, all!
not another soldier will die!
and I could do to replenish my ranks.
what say you, most brave and merciful king of Argos?
will you spare these men?
king Amphitryon, I accept your challenge.
prepare to die.
Amphitryon! Amphitryon! Amphitryon!
the campaign ends here, for now.
Chiron told me you took Egypt because they attacked our ships.
that's right. - But Argos, our neighbor, they presented no threat.
I see Chiron has been expanding your Curriculum.
I do not need a tutor to tell me when there's peace.
I took Argos for you.
for me? You took Argos for its gold.
Yes. That, too.
but I'm told they're obsessed with the gods here, just like you.
you know, if they had as many soldiers as they have priests...
it would be my body on the pyre tonight.
you summoned me, Majesty? How is Prince Iphicles tonight?
what will you teach him, Chiron?
will you teach him war? - It cannot be ignored, Majesty.
history is but a chronicle of war.
and war is but a chronicle of grief...
recounted in the tears of young men's Mothers.
sometimes, Majesty...
I question who between us is the tutor and who is student.
in my own vanity, I thought I could bring Tenderness...
to a man whose craving for power is sated by nothing...
and only grows with each victory.
no god's wrath could bring the anguish...
that my king has beset upon this land.
and so I prostrate myself before you, Goddess.
deliver us from this curse.
help my people.
Majesty!
Hera accepts your gift.
goddess Hera?
queen Alcmene... approach.
Majesty, no!
closer. Let me look upon you.
you will have your deliverer. Another son you shall bear.
no. Please not by this man. Please, Goddess...
tell me, would you betray your king...
as my king betrays me in his lust for you?
would you have his mortal son to quell your sorrow...
and bring peace to this land?
would you bear the son of Zeus?
for the sake of peace, I would.
then, for the sake of peace, I shall permit it.
name him what you wish, but I shall know him as "Hercules."
Hercules
where is he?
who is he?
who is this man you spurn me for night after night? Who?
please, Majesty! - Where is he?
my king!
intruder! Search the camp! Find him! Find him!
speak. - It's a boy, Sire.
a fine, large boy.
his name will be Alcides...
and he will never be an equal to his older brother.
Hercules.
your name shall be Hercules.
be careful, there are snakes in the trees!
I didn't know you fear them! - Watch out!
so, what else do you fear?
I fear but one thing. I always have.
your departure, each and every time.
is this another private hideaway?
you just wait. I think you'll like it.
Alcides!
stop!
Alcides!
lose something?
you made me nearly faint with fright!
come. Come here.
I like your necklace.
my mother once gave this as a parting gift to my father.
and though she's with the gods now...
I want you to have it.
it's only stone...
but I wish it were gold.
I wish there were a substance finer than that to have you remember me by.
there is.
my mind's eye.
where your face has been etched since the day I first saw you.
careful. Your horse could have lost its footing.
you be careful... brother.
princess, your father is worried.
a search party was dispatched.
it's lucky you knew where to find us.
Yes. Though I'd rather it had been some other man's luck.
princess, you rode out without saying a word.
and what word would have permitted me to?
captain, send the princess back to the palace.
there is a feast tonight and she must not be late.
Yes, my Prince. - No, brother.
you ride with me.
we'll see each other tonight.
saw your hoof marks in the forest.
tell me, what would you have done if she'd been thrown and broken her neck?
I thought you knew her better.
more likely I would break my neck.
I saw more than hoof marks today.
did you? - Watch yourself!
I've known her just as long as you have, and with a more mature eye!
I'm older than you, Alcides, and heir to the throne!
let's back away slowly. Don't turn your horse.
no, let's escape. Your horse can outrun it. - Yours wouldn't.
what are you doing?
now, back your horse behind me. - Oh, yes, of course.
and what a tale of bravery the next king of Tiryns will have to tell tonight.
Iphicles! The point of this was for one of us to get away.
a Nemean lion. - A man eater! They can't be killed!
our spears are useless!
Alcides!
Iphicles. Where have you been?
what is that thing? Take it off.
why, it appears to be the skin of the Nemean lion!
the lion, which I killed but two hours ago.
look, this is where it struck. You see, Father?
but I'm all right. No cut to the eye. - Where was your brother in this contest?
Alcides?
he ran away at the first sign of danger.
have you ever known my brother flee danger?
have you, Princess?
no. Never.
well... I thought you knew him better than that.
tell them. Father.
so it has a chance to sink into some of the thicker heads here.
my friend, King Tallas the Brave, ruler or Crete...
we have enjoyed free commerce between our lands...
tonight we make a bargain for something far greater.
the peace between our houses will be sealed four moons hence...
with the harvest moon, when my heir, Prince Iphicles.
will take the Princess of Crete to be his wife!
Yes!
Hebe! Hebe, stop!
why don't you enlighten me on what just happened.
I believe the announcement took them by surprise, Father.
the only surprise is that you allowed her to behave in such a manner...
without even lifting a finger, lion slayer.
what could I have done?
I am Amphitryon the Conqueror...
ruler of the realm, vanquisher of Argos.
you are my son, and tonight you stood and watched...
as your future wife made a fool of you and me...
in front of our most formidable threat: Crete.
look at them. It makes you look weak.
I'm sorry, Father. - I don't want you to be sorry.
I want you to be a man.
you're the future king of Tiryns. Act like it.
Hebe! Hebe, stop!
stop! Stop!
come here.
I won't marry him.
I'd rather die.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I need you strong.
are you strong?
I want to leave with you... tonight.
if we can make it across the river to Tyga...
the King's men won't follow us.
that's them! - Go, Hebe, run west!
no, I won't leave you! - I'll be right behind you! Go!
after them!
you two, follow her! Now!
you heard the orders! Don't hurt the Prince!
faster!
stop! Stop! - Alcides!
Hebe! - Help!
Alcides!
help!
Alcides!
captain Sotiris.
is the Fourth Battalion ready to sail tomorrow?
160 men, Your Grace, ready and accounted for, as you commanded.
good. You'll take half. No more.
half? - You are young.
learn to keep 80 in line and we'll see about expanding your command.
you disapprove?
no, Your Grace.
we'll be victorious and honor your name.
I have him, Father!
I understand you're having some trouble with the arrangements we've made.
your arrangements you may find spoiled by the next harvest moon.
I think not. You sail to Egypt tomorrow.
there's been a revolt in Heliopolis, north of the Nile River delta.
you will enjoy war, Alcides, and you will forget all this.
I certainly don't fear for your survival.
may your mother's gods be with you, if they be at all.
ask him about Hebe.
one final thing.
your brother here seems obsessed with the thought...
that you've taken the girl's maidenhood.
why don't you reassure him that's not the case.
certainly, I shall.
I assure you, brother...
it's none of your business.
I wish you endless victories in the battlefield, brother.
because if you return here, I will kill you.
Alcides, I beg you to understand...
that you have a purpose on this earth beyond this one desire.
I've no purpose other than claiming the love that is mine!
I damn the King for denying it to me, and I damn the gods for taking her from me!
Hercules! - Majesty, no.
what did you call me?
you are not the son of Amphitryon.
I swear on my love for you, you are Hercules...
gift of Hera, son of Zeus.
Chiron. - My Prince.
has my mother spoken of this to anyone?
no. I assure you, no one.
because the King is a jealous man and most likely would believe this mad talk.
open the gates!
Alcides!
hold!
have heart, my love! I will return before you know it!
and you will be marrying me!
three moons from now!
what troubles you?
the King first ordered my full company...
then halved it before we left.
there's no campaign underway. Peace is secured in Crete.
two divisions lay idle in camp.
why would that fool deny me even the smallest excess of troops?
we do not know what awaits us in Heliopolis!
horus Pass. We'll be there by sunset and make camp.
there must be another way than through a pass.
along with our numbers, our route was changed as well.
your father wants us in Heliopolis a day sooner.
scouts forward!
plenty of water for all!
cold and clean.
any word of the scouts? It's been too long since they left.
make camp here. Feed the horses and the men.
now, we need 20 volunteers on foot...
cause we're gonna secure the passage.
some say the Golden Eagle's a sign from Zeus.
Yes. And some believe it's just a bird.
Sotiris.
men... fall back to the camp.
I led them to their deaths.
fall back! Retreat! Back the way we came!
battle formation!
Testudo!
Archers!
Archers! Form up!
we're the only two left! - Take them alive!
commander Tarak. - Over here.
the Prince's helmet.
who is the captain?
I am.
is this the helmet of the Prince named Alcides?
is it? - Yes.
where does he lie?
where does he lie?
he lies there.
where you got him.
take this to the King.
captain, you are strong-willed...
but this one, even half dead...
he's twice as strong as my best fighter.
if I thought you'd live, I'd sell you both for a princely sum.
sell us. Sell us! Sell us.
we will live.
who are you, soldier?
Hercules.
I cooled it off for you.
there's far worse pain awaiting where you two are going.
would the King really do this?
sacrifice is own men to ensure the death of one?
his own son!
why did you choose to live?
do you know of the engagement between my brother Iphicles and Hebe, Princess of Crete?
Yes. It was announced before our departure.
I must make it back to Tiryns before the wedding.
you stay by my side...
I'll make you a guest of honor at what shall be my wedding.
I fear you've been within the palace walls too long, my Prince.
I've traveled the world...
and I know what's out there. - You are wrong.
surely you have something to return to.
of course.
a wife and son. - Set your mind on them.
and nothing else!
so, tell me...
who is this... Hercules?
I don't yet know.
mother?
are you sick, Mother?
do I seem so? - Often. At the sight of me.
this is foolish talk.
you are my son.
the one who is living.
yet I feel more absent than the one who is not.
Iphicles... we are both grieving.
but in this sea of grief there must be a drop of felicitation.
I am to be wed three moons hence.
Yes.
you are right.
you have won yourself a fine bride.
a bride, yes. But have I won a wife?
she will serve you well.
is this my hope?
mother, how do I win her as my father won you?
please. I am not Alcides.
I know that. To her or to you.
your father won me but for a moment...
which passed so fast I cannot remember.
this is what you will have with Hebe.
this is what has come of it.
a marriage that she does not want...
and the death of your brother.
I paid good money for both of you.
I expect a return.
Hercules, what is it?
it's the first full moon.
she does not even know I live.
come on!
you miserable misers!
I was told you Sicilians had money!
who wants to bet on Sotiris?
tell me, friend, can you win your way out of here?
Oh, yes.
that way.
you're next, Greek.
you'd better win just as much as your friend there...
or perhaps you prefer to breathe mud.
you said... "Stay by my side.
I say we're doomed.
I promise you, I will return you to your family.
fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
kill! Kill! Kill!
you called for me. I am here.
thank you for joining me...
so that Hera may bless this marriage.
why do you look at me this way?
have you found peace, Alcmene?
if you will tell me how my son found his death, I would.
will you tell me how he found life?
Yes.
Yes, Amphitryon, at long last I will tell you.
he was not my son, I know it!
do not dare deny it! - I will not.
who sired him? Tell me! Do you even know?
how many lovers did you take? - One!
you lie! - I took one for a single night...
and for a single purpose: To put an end to your rule!
tell me! - Zeus!
Zeus came to my bed and planted a seed in me...
to spawn a son to end your tyranny!
and now, you have murdered the son of the god of gods...
and you are doomed. You are doomed.
you're doomed.
No! No!
the Queen...
in her grief, has taken her own life.
you made me a fortune today, Hercules.
your trifles are of no interest to me.
a man of great enterprise. - "Great enterprise.
you want real enterprise, you take us to Greece.
Greece? - In the kingdoms of Greece...
your games would draw thousands.
I draw thousands here.
thousands of laughs, he means. - Laughs? What do you mean?
let me put it this way, in King Amphitryon's lands...
sport is war and war is sport.
and between the two, the King is Hades' most reliable supplier.
now, they hold an event once a year...
that is the most elaborate, beautiful and rich affair...
you know, actually, it's not for you. No, it's the purest stuff there.
none of this slipping in mud, dancing on beams. Oh, no.
just men on solid ground wielding bronze forged into shapes...
even the tyrant King himself could not have conceived of.
how is the wagering? - How's the wagering?
my friend, I doubt you have the imagination to even dream of it.
for example, in the final contest, and that means...
the richest contest, mind you...
two men fight against six.
six that have never been beaten.
now, if they win, well, the two go free.
but the odds would be against it.
you'd find advantage in that, I'm sure. - But if they win...
tidy sum of gold in it for you.
why would I fight you two?
we've never lost. - Neither have they.
cut his head off, he would not be any dumber.
one must fight with brawn and brain.
mind your words, my friend.
I will arrange the grandest arena in Sicily.
you two battling Half-Face and Humbaba.
the victors shall go on a boat...
with me to Greece.
and now... for the event you have been waiting for!
four unbeaten champions of Sicily...
battling for a journey to the greatest tourney in Greece!
I give you the ferocious...
the terrifying...
Half-Face and Humbaba!
and their challengers...
Hercules and Sotiris of Tiryns!
Hercules!
Humbaba!
kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
fight! Fight! Fight!
Sotiris!
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!
are you mad? He was wounded.
you killed the only man who could replace him.
I can still fight, Lucius!
all right! Against the six best fighters in Greece.
you're as good as dead. The agreement is off.
you're back in the pits tomorrow. - We won't fight. Unless in Greece.
then you'll die.
go ahead, kill us. Who then will fight for your silver?
you dare to threaten me?
would you really lose your two best fighters?
would you see your money bag even a single piece of silver lighter...
you miserable, gutless old miser?
look at you! You can hardly walk!
you're useless! What I need to take you for?
because you're setting him free. - No, Hercules.
I will fight them. Alone.
then you are going to a certain death.
we have another two days at sea!
he's been at the bow ever since we left the port.
my name is Sotiris, captain of the Fourth Division.
I rode for Heliopolis with your prince...
and we're the only two survivors.
the other is a man of much renown.
his name is Hercules.
a man has come to our shores!
a slave with the name of Hercules!
a "Gift of Hera" we are to believe!
we return him not as a man, but as a pile of bloody guts and bone...
on which the canines of Olympus may feast!
I give you...
Hercules!
he is fighting for his freedom...
against the six greatest undefeated champions of Greece!
commander. Captain.
see for yourself. - And you tell us this is Prince Alcides?
and if it is, you're with us?
Yes. And not us alone, Sotiris. I promise you.
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!
my Prince.
Chiron, give me news of Hebe!
please, Chiron, will you bring her to me?
I will find some way.
thank you, Sotiris. I know you have someone to see, as well.
soon enough.
tell him the condition of the army.
there's a great mistrust ever since your company perished.
the King is squeezing anything he can from the people to hire foreign mercenaries.
I will sound out our most trusted officers.
they will rally to us.
and my brother, will he come to our side?
it is his men pillaging the villages.
and any spoils are their wages.
I fear you'll have to defeat...
both this king and the next.
Chiron, you must not let on a thing to Hebe.
she could never hide happiness.
now, "Gift of Hera..."
call upon all your strength, because I must tell you something.
I have terrible news about your mother.
she is no longer with us.
she met her death with her own dagger.
I drew it myself from her chest...
as the King fled the temple.
your name was on her dying breath.
the King will pay for this.
will your men stay behind us?
they are your men now.
they will stand behind you.
as will I.
out of my way, woman!
move, woman! Move!
we're taking your property in the name of the King!
No! Please, don't!
get down on your knees!
does it really take four men to steal one man's livelihood?
draw swords!
stand down.
is it true? You are Hercules, the god?
no, I'm just a man.
it's time to send the King a message.
now I understand why your men prefer desertion, Iphicles.
I just received the news. - Of what?
these three bumbling half-wits, or the rising rebellion at our doorstep?
Majesty, they say Sotiris, Captain of Fourth Division, is back.
he is leading the desertion.
father, I'll take responsibility for this.
let me find Sotiris. I'll make him lead us to Hercules.
when our allies from Egypt, Germania, and the horn of Africa arrive tomorrow...
Sotiris, Hercules, even Zeus himself will be but a memory.
what is this place? - Captain Sotiris arranged it.
this house will serve as safe haven, it would appear.
the woman inside says she knows you.
she says she fled Argos with the King's invasion.
you swear to me this is the second son of Alcmene...
slain Queen of Tiryns?
Yes. Alcides.
though he's known now to the people... - As Hercules.
Yes, I know. I was present for the naming.
my friend says you were of Argos until my father brought his wrath upon it.
your father brought wrath upon many...
but Argos, that was a mortal's doing.
where have you brought me? - To the truth, Hercules.
to the truth of you.
you may claim your bride and ride a thousand days, it will not matter.
your destiny lies in something beyond.
your journey in life will take you farther from love...
than you can imagine.
my mother said that very thing...
the last day I set eyes on her.
she was wise. But even she did not understand the whole of it.
you must accept who you are.
only then can you unlock the doors to your own potential.
embrace your father, and you will discover...
powers that you never imagined.
where was this father when 80 good men perished next to me?
where was he when my mother was murdered?
your father has always been there, Hercules.
you were just not ready for him.
Zeus can't change the minds of mortals...
but he has given you a gift.
and be warned, abuse it and it will lead to your destruction.
respect it, and it will save you and those you love.
you will accept me... love me.
we will have children...
and you will love every one equally!
won't you? Equally!
Iphicles.
restore me to my home.
return me to my father.
the gods do not want this marriage.
I do not want this marriage.
well, it will be.
mark me, two moons hence.
or you may take your life, as well.
princess!
princess.
I cannot bear it, Chiron.
I'm sick of living.
the gods save me!
what would have happened had I not just now returned?
you were gone for days, with not a word to me.
I'm sorry, Princess.
there was a reason.
you say this to me...
as if I'm blind to the moon's phase.
I know what's in store.
no, you don't.
it's me.
it's me.
how did you keep it...
when you lost so much else?
because losing this, I would've lost it all.
it's mine! You gave it to me, yeah?
is there still pain? - Have no worry.
where should we go?
no, not where. Doesn't matter where.
just that we go. And this time, I shall escape him.
we will be together...
but not in any foreign land.
not in Tyga.
but here...
in my homeland.
your Majesty, I understand there's a small problem.
tell me, Tarak, did I not pay you a sizeable amount of gold...
to kill every last man of those 80 men?
Yes, of course.
then how is it there is a survivor?
and not only Captain Sotiris, but another man.
a savior people call "Hercules."
he is rallying the villagers...
and even my own soldiers against my rule.
what are you going to do about it?
answer me!
if, and I say, if this is true...
I will rectify this error.
darling flower, I missed you.
and I hate to say it, but...
we need to leave now.
what is it? ls the bloom off the rose so soon after my arrival?
is this him?
Yes.
how is it you survived? No one survives those places.
hope.
I was given hope.
stop!
and what is your hope now, Captain Sotiris?
that my son's life be spared.
then take us to Hercules.
Hercules.
I didn't believe him. And I'm not certain I do now.
you... are Hercules.
take him away! Take Sotiris and execute the others!
stand aside for the King!
people of Tiryns, I give you your mighty Hercules.
he bleeds! And why?
because he is nothing more than an impostor!
a liar! A man of flesh and blood!
and what has this so-called savior wrought?
your farms lie untilled, your villages lay burned...
and your brothers rot dead in the fields!
is this the message of hope?
so, self-proclaimed son of Zeus...
how will you offer these people their salvation...
when you cannot even save yourself?
bring out the other traitors!
take me, but spare these good men!
he begs for mercy for his traitors!
Iphicles, your future king!
strike this affliction from our lands forever.
so that tonight we may celebrate...
as you wed the Princess of Crete!
brother! Brother! Brother!
Chiron was there when you were born.
you were sick.
kill him. - My Prince.
this life has not been wasted.
I have had the honor to stand by the greatest hero...
the gods have ever given the people.
brother... please.
father!
I believe in you!
grant me strength!
retreat!
do something! Stop him!
Commissionaires! - Kill him!
get up. Get up. Come on.
we stand with you, my Prince, as do the four divisions under our command.
the people are ready to lay down their lives for you, Hercules.
lead us to victory!
brave men of Tiryns!
I can only lead you through those gates!
what our fate is beyond them, I cannot say.
I only know what fate there is in retreat.
tonight we fight, not for what we have but for that which has been so savagely ripped from our breast!
Alcides the Prince...
betrays his king...
but a son of Zeus takes his first breath of life tonight...
and fulfills his promise to his father.
let this night be forever remembered...
as the hour upon which...
we took back our kingdom!
there is my bride.
I declare to you that I love another.
he's the reason I want to wake up in the morning and embrace the day.
if you so wound him that his face were unrecognizable to me...
I would love him.
if his tongue were cut from his throat and I hadn't his voice to delight me...
I would love him.
and if you make only a memory of him...
I would love him even more eternally.
that is what you have to look forward to.
halt in the name of the king!
identify yourselves!
you will be fired upon! Archers ready!
shields!
that is Sotiris and the men of the Fourth! We were told they'd deserted!
captain! - Hold your fire!
I have taken arrows before!
if you fight to defend tyranny, let them fly!
men!
we take Tiryns! We take our lands!
lower your aim!
Sotiris!
fire!
we are with you, Hercules!
forward!
king Amphitryon! Show yourself!
where are you, you coward!
hiding with your Prince?
Hercules! I apologize for the Prince...
but he's about to consummate his marriage to Queen Hebe...
the future wife of the next king of Tiryns!
and as for myself, well, I come to welcome you home.
as a matter of fact, I have a little surprise for you.
battle formation!
king Amphitryon, my sword against yours!
Victor takes all!
the city, its subjects, army, riches!
not another soldier shall die!
what say you, most brave and merciful King of Tiryns?
will you spare these men?
imitation, the highest form of flattery.
accept your destiny!
cause I already rule it all, my son.
I'm not your son, you murdering coward!
and the one who rules it all is my true father!
lay down your weapons or prepare to die!
Tarak, kill the traitors!
soldiers!
prepare to...
slaughter!
have you come to bring the wrath of Zeus upon me, boy!
No! I come to you as a mortal...
to bring the wrath of Alcides...
upon the tyrant who killed my mother.
come at me, boy, and learn...
why I am the slayer of kings!
come!
get up!
brother! Release him!
release him this moment, or I will kill her.
my son... you may not be a total loss after all.
Alcides, I do not matter.
do you agree, brother?
because as long as you can't have her, she does not matter to me.
and she's made it perfectly clear, I do not matter to her.
brother, no! - Release him!
we shall be together, my love.
No!
my love.
do not fear.
I fear...
but one thing, I always have...
your departure each and every time.
I'm here now. - This time, please stay.
I promise.
the LOST HONOUR OF KATHARINA BLUM
Hello, Katharina? What a noise.
Hans is so drunk we had to put him to bed.
and Klaus is on detail.
we've come here to try and pick up someone else.
you nun, don't be so proper! See you.
take him with us.
going to a party?
want to come to a party?
if you care to accept me, - and without a costume. - We'll get you a fake nose.
where are we going? - To a distant relative's, aunt Else.
we're from the same hometown. - Nice aunt.
don't touch me! - We'll see.
not so fast, man!
shit!
sheik Karl from Kuwait and his harem.
I need a napkin. - What for?
a bottle of wine fell. - Red or white wine?
red wine. - Just use salt.
this is pepper. - Here you are.
who's that beauty? - My cousin, Katharina Blum.
the nun?
everybody is feeling well.
occupied! They went right onto first name terms.
that was no encounter, that was a reunion.
occupied!
Woltersheim, Else. Mergentheimer Str. 3, telephone 349462.
Blum, Katharina, address still unknown. I'll call back. Over.
talking to yourself?
just telling myself a couple of new jokes.
you are nuts! - You girls are pretty tasty.
not so prudish, eh? - You might need a little grease job.
just a moment! Hach.
good evening, Mr. D. A. Beizmenne speaking.
were you having dinner?
I need to continue the emergency service.
two this time. "Escape danger."
Woltersheim, Else and Blum, Katharina.
thank you, doctor. Good night.
thursday, FEBRUARY 6, 1975 CARNIVAL NIGHT - Attention! Official police action! - Who are you?
get against the wall! - Don't put up any resistance!
this is an official police action! Don't put up any resistance!
where is he?
nobody here, boss.
where is he?
he is gone.
impossible!
Why?
we've watched the house since last night.
if he's not here, he can't be far.
if you want him to be able to walk, better tell us where he is.
he can't have vanished into the air. Go ahead!
search for weapons! - How do you know he was here?
you admit you gave him shelter! When did he leave?
when I woke up, Ludwig had already left.
without a goodbye? - Yes.
did he fuck you?
I wouldn't use that word.
we know each other.
I've seen you somewhere before.
Yes, I work for the Blornas.
please get dressed.
it looks bad if you're parading in front of our employees.
I'm not parading. I'm at home.
Mrs. Blum, plea...
what was that? Take care! - Sorry.
please get dressed! - Don't be so nervous.
give that to me.
sharpshooters dismissed! - Take a dress.
he slipped through your fingers again.
m? ding!
come on. The door stays open.
what's my crime?
take your clothes off!
what did Ludwig do? - The D. A. will explain.
bend over!
you have a nice bathroom.
four batteries, a strong alarm-clock, two reels of wire and various tools.
a short-haired wig, blond.
books: two love stories, three crime stories, a biography of Napoleon, and a biography of Queen Christina.
all from a book club. Typically bourgeois literature.
nothing else? No weapons?
we found this note in a crime novel.
no other clue for the time being.
what about the two cups on the table?
what use is this to you?
I am a conscienceless, godless man, but gold is revered, and so is its owner.
the divine strength of gold lies in its being, as the estranged, alienated and self-alienating essence of Man.
it is the alienated property of Men.
sit down here.
did G? tten write that? - No, it has nothing to do with Ludwig.
gold is revered, and so is its owner.
written by a bank-robber, it makes sense.
it's by Karl Marx. - Probably the early writings.
so you've read Marx?
no. - Is that your handwriting?
father Urbanus, a Dominican, wrote it down for me.
you can check. Hohenblumenberg convent.
you mean you know Marx through the Dominicans?
you chose the wrong Order.
the police requests all occupants of the house to supply any information they can.
please report anything suspicious.
there she is!
the duty of the press is to inform the public.
take this down: D. A. Hach speaking.
we're dealing here with one or several terrorists, militarily organized, with little regard for human life.
sucker!
attention! The police requests all occupants of the house to supply any information they can.
you were on first name terms? - Yes.
without knowing him? - Yes.
didn't Hertha Scheumel call before the party?
Yes. - Why?
she asked if they could bring someone.
did she say whom?
she didn't know then. They wanted to make a pick up.
and you sent your Ludwig!
right after the call he comes to that easily recognizable blonde who was all dressed up.
this sophisticated trick allows Blum to introduce G? tten at her aunt's place, without arousing suspicion.
there she gave up even trying to cover up.
as soon as he arrived, both danced intimately.
I did dance with Ludwig, but the rest isn't true.
do you often dance with strangers? - No.
you made an exception for G tten, although you never dance?
I did dance before.
with Dr. Blorna and his friends, politicians and businessmen, when I helped out evenings at parties.
after I got my car, I turned down those invitations.
why did you?
because the men were often drunk, and made advances to me.
before that, I had to be driven home.
I danced with this man a couple of times.
we won't get personal.
only answer the questions that are put to you.
G tten's advances didn't bother you?
Ludwig didn't make advances, - He was tender. - Same thing.
it is not!
advances are a one-sided action, and tenderness is quite different.
it comes from both parties. - Who cares about that?
we want to know if you had an appointment.
I won't sign if you keep "advances" instead of "tenderness."
alright, "tenderness." Thank her if this takes forever.
we enjoy listening.
how come last night precisely you didn't take your car?
it was safer by bus, - I didn't know how much I'd drink. - You often get drunk?
no. In fact never.
pardon. Once, someone got me drunk.
my husband. - What are you telling me?
you said you never drink, so why take the bus?
you know why you didn't take your car?
you wanted to leave with G tten in his Porsche!
I told you...
I felt like getting drunk.
instead, you split with him!
we know why.
how do you explain...
you, who are so proper that your friends call you "the nun..."
that you throw yourselves into the arms of a stranger to take him to your room and have intercourse with him?
what is it? Love at first sight? Tenderness?
advances? Or just a quick lay?
want something to eat? - No, thank you.
don't put on airs. You must be hungry.
we'd like to have a warm meal ourselves.
it is not as good as yours this morning, but you didn't finish your breakfast.
no, thank you. - You're only punishing yourself.
as an adult citizen, you should have understood the need to interrogate you.
some people find it hard to distinguish between private and business life.
enjoy your meal.
come on, girl!
you'll get hungry as you eat.
I'm not a monster.
can I wait outside, please?
I can also lock you in a cell, if you can't stand the sight of me.
Yes, please. I'd like it better.
men have been sentenced to eight years and more, and are still appreciating my fairness.
but we can be different. Pletzer!
have her put in a cell.
that hurts! - You don't say.
looks like someone got sick.
you really don't want anything? We can send out for something and bill you for it.
no sense of humor.
the people in contact with the fugitive have all been checked out.
a bartender who served him a beer, two girls he danced with.
we'll question them. Hertha Scheumel and Claudia.
no, not the girls he danced with.
did he talk to other girls, too?
a gas station attendant, a cigarette store salesman, a bank clerk who changed $ 700 for him, probably from a bank robbery.
numbers are being checked in Washington.
all of these have been positively identified as chance meetings.
not one word he exchanged with them suggests anything like a code.
Yes, gentlemen.
we are mystified.
for 36 hours he was under constant surveillance.
he took advantage of the Carnival to get away.
shouldn't we try to arrest this Sheik Karl and investigate his highly obscure role?
after all, he's the one who introduced him at the party.
didn't it occur to you that Mr. Beizmenne deliberately left him out?
he's one of our men.
why wasn't Gordon arrested if you had him under surveillance?
all of the inspector Beizmennes moves have been approved by Internal Security in Bonn.
just a moment.
you think she's innocent,Modin?
I see it the other way round.
I'd have taken her to my place.
the morning after, she'd tell me the police were after her.
you'd turn her in. - I probably would.
but I suppose an average man would not.
not everyone works for the police.
anyone who thinks like that doesn't belong in the force, Modin.
Mrs. Blum?
Mrs. Blum is in the county hospital.
my name is Totges. We're investigating for The Paper...
her daughter Katharina... she has no other relatives?
there's a younger brother, Kurt. He is in jail.
interesting. What for?
I don't know. - And the mother?
not surprising, with that little bastard.
the husband came back from the war a wreck, just to die. All the better for him.
ask the reverend what happened in the sacristy.
Skoni！ Come on!
we still have some time left.
sad... sad... sad...
Skoni！
a waitress may look like a whore, but she shouldn't be one.
I need that. I have stomach trouble.
soup.
you must eat soup, Skoni.
and Katharina Blum - was she a whore?
her? No!
stiff as a board. You couldn't even pinch her ass.
too square and too shy.
and then she fell for the first one who laid her.
he married her. Brettloh.
this one. Third from the right.
he is - pardon the expression - a genuine ass-kisser.
wilhelm, you're going to be in the papers!
Brettloh, Wilhelm.
Totges. We're from The Paper... We're here on account of Katharina.
so you're the husband. - I was.
I'm sure you can tell us a lot.
dial.
ladies, care for a hump with me?
give me the editorial staff.
looks like a sex desert here. Perhaps we can get laid.
damning reputation throughout the village.
the ex-husband, an honest working man, Wilhelm Brettloh, who divorced Blum on grounds of desertion, told us, hardly holding back his tears:
I know at last why she ran off on me.
our humble happiness wasn't enough for her.
she wanted to get up in the world, and how could a modest working man ever get a Porsche?
give my advice to the readers of The Paper..."'
just a minute! Coming!
this is where false ideas of Socialism are bound to lead.
I ask you and your readers: How does a housekeeper come by that wealth?
it couldn't have been honestly.
Hello!
it happens.
sports. - Thank you.
tell me, would you say your housekeeper was capable of committing a crime?
what do you mean?
everyone is capable of committing a crime.
interesting. - So are you.
aren't you the attorney Blorna? - Yes.
I'm from the Austrian bureau of The Paper...
Katharina Blum has been arrested in that action against anarchists.
Katharina arrested? Impossible.
it's not that bad. They'll probably let her run around for a while.
who? - Katharina.
could you tell me more about her? - It's a misunderstanding.
lf you refuse, it'll look bad and can be misinterpreted.
to keep silent in such a case - this is a front-page story
could only have bad implications.
Katharina is a very bright, sensible girl.
did you ever notice her political opinions?
Why? - Or do you yourself sympathize with...
that's enough. - Weren't you reluctant to hire someone like her?
couldn't she have a look at them? - What are you suggesting?
according to our sources,Dr. Stabrel ubleder is your partner.
no, I'm the counsel for the corporation of which he is the main stockholder.
we are on vacation. Goodbye!
thank you. That will do.
I don't know" means I'm not entitled to say anything.
I'm sorry.
we know the place is a hide-out, and Blum gave shelter not only to Gordon but possibly to others.
our staff has collected valuable background material.
did you know that the Blum girl has had a gentleman friend for two years?
the nun!
No! - Just an hour or so.
what kind of man is this Blorna? Did you dig up anything?
Yes, another "coincidence": Blorna happened to go on vacation, when Gordon appeared.
his wife, an architect.
in student days she was known as "Trudy the Red.
not for her opinions, but for the color of her hair.
Mrs. Blum, to interrogation.
wait here a minute.
Mrs. Schwill!
Mr. Ruhwiedel.
rather good-looking. Obviously a high-class gentleman.
I wouldn't say that. - I would.
might those visitors have been the men who sometimes drove you home after parties?
is it forbidden to have gentlemen friends?
Mrs. Blum, is it clear to you that this is a very serious case with many implications that have kept the police and D. A.'s office busy for over a year?
may I ask you: Are your gentlemen friends - since you admit they exist...
Yes. - Good.
are there many, or just one?
one.
so you've known Gordon for two years!
no.
I only met Ludwig yesterday.
then who was it? - Who was your gentleman friend?
he has nothing to do with Ludwig.
get out of here! - Unbelievable. They're still working.
do you recognize this ring? - Yes.
is it yours? - Yes.
do you know its value? - It can't be much.
we had it appraised by a jeweler in the city, to be fair to you.
this ring is worth eight to ten thousand marks.
how much? - Eight to ten thousand.
it was a gift. - A gift? From whom? What for?
and this letter, found in your bedside table, with your address: Mrs. K. Blum, Hochkeppelstr. 7, Cologne 1.
who sent it, if not Gordon?
he has nothing to do with Ludwig.
nothing wrong in having a friend.
you're divorced. You've no ties.
and it's no crime that you take advantage of it.
eight to ten thousand.
may I go back to my cell?
I have nothing more to say.
interrogation ended at 9: 40 p. m.
two cups of tea and a piece of cake were brought to the detainee, who accepted and paid for them.
shouldn't we let her sleep at home?
I think it best to let her loose. Perhaps he'll get in touch with her.
shouldn't we lock her up for her own safety?
you can sleep at home. - We can't expose her to any danger.
in love, Modin? - Mr. Beizmenne, Bonn!
you can take her home.
in case you're free tomorrow night. - Thank you very much, Mr. D. A.
how did your tender Ludwig leave the house?
all exits were watched.
you must have shown him a way out. But I'll find him.
and if there is any shooting, it's obvious who'll get it. Good night!
your name is Katharina? - And yours?
Ludwig.
I haven't called a man by his first name in ages.
how long? - Four years.
five.
of course, there are fellow workers I call by their first names.
I'm not a fellow worker. - I know.
I'm so happy, and a little scared.
scared? Of what?
lf I knew, I wouldn't be scared.
I was married once, and it didn't turn out well.
let's leave soon.
yes? Ludwig?
Yes, this is Katharina Blum.
you fat bitch. Is your pussy ready?
will you give me a blowjob? Will you give me a hand job?
you pig.
must I force happiness upon you?
I'm warning you. Your neighbor.
drunk.
are you feeling okay?
were you following me in your car?
you won't lose us that easy. Two beers.
I almost had an accident.
what are you scared of? Aren't you innocent?
friday, FEBRUARY 7, 1975
was her flat the seat of conspiracy, a mob hideout, a weapon cache?
the ex-husband, an honest working man, Wilhelm Brettloh, who divorced Blum on grounds of desertion, could hardly hold back his tears:
I know at last why she ran off on me.
our humble happiness wasn't enough for her.
she wanted to get up in the world, and how could a candid, modest-working man ever get a Porsche? '
as a warning he added:
this is where false ideas of Socialism are bound to lead.
now I know why I feared her radicalism and her hatred of the Church. '
her employer, the notorious corporation lawyer Blorna, when asked, told The Paper:
Katharina is ice-cold and calculating, and I hold her capable of committing a crime."'
I know exactly what I told this guy.
I said, she's bright and sensitive.
at best don't say a thing. They can't force you.
I like you.
we like you very much.
Yes.
she doesn't take this garbage seriously!
do you know what she said?
unbelievable. I know now how these pigs work.
that doesn't sound like her.
do you know if she met him long ago?
she'd never talk about it.
she says he's safe.
she's laying herself open to prosecution.
that's what I told her.
we have to go back.
father Urbanus, I'm sorry about the note, but I liked the Karl Marx quote so much that I had to keep it.
I'm not blaming you, my dear.
I know what situation you're in.
but that isn't why I sent for you.
we were afraid you would be detained longer.
Katharina!
I thank you for coming.
I find it very foolish to summon me here.
you hadn't guessed that I wanted to see you? - No.
lf you had, you wouldn't have come.
I understand and admire you, Katharina.
I'm sorry that you got into trouble because of me.
I'd like to thank you, Katharina.
I've never doubted your courage and sensitivity.
I'd like to help you.
Yes, I know.
I have been punished, too.
I love you.
one word from you, I'd turn myself in and confess:
look, it's me.
I bought her the ring.
I'm the gentleman friend.
you'd do that? - I'd do anything to help you.
anything...
that would help you.
it wouldn't help me.
I often waited for you.
I never completely gave up hope that you'd show up one day.
of your own choice.
but now I see: It was in vain.
so it's better that I take back the key.
you still have it?
it wasn't found in the search.
you forced me to take it. I never wanted it.
so you can give it back to me. Wait!
you don't know how much it means to me. Father Urbanus!
did you suspect your daughter led a double life?
Why?
how does a mother feel, faced with that?
it must have been a great shock to you.
what for?
of all people, no one knows Katharina's character better.
Mrs. Blum, how do you explain how your daughter has come to this?
can you tell me? - Why?
what are you doing? No visitors allowed!
the woman needs rest. - She will soon rest.
man, you can't do that. - Shut up.
here comes Katharina Blum with her aunt, Mrs. Woltersheim, into the Police building.
the heavily burdened young lady seems very calm.
according to the D. A.'s press release,
Gordon's hiding place still remains unknown, in spite of information received.
mothers are giving, even sick ones.
how did you get to the mother? - I'm an old pro.
it had to come to this,'
she whispered in a dying voice." Did she really say that?
we must help simple people express themselves.
Mrs. Woltersheim also has something to hide.
her father, his name is Lumm, she's a natural child, was a Communist.
in 1932, he emigrated to the Soviet Union, where he disappeared.
here are interesting xeroxes our staff has provided.
if he's in town, we can expect news for the weekend edition.
you won't have to wait long.
I've got news on the Blum case. "Backers in the GDR.
well-informed police circles tell us that Mrs. Woltersheim has something to hide, as well.
documentary evidence shows that her father, Peter Lumm, emigrated to the USSR in '32, where he disappeared.
Mrs. Hedwig Plotten, please report to department 3A!
good morning. Did you sleep well?
don't blame it on the police if I'm a little rude.
I'm only a man, and sometimes pretty blunt.
we realize you must investigate Katharina's role, but...
Mrs. Woltersheim? - Yes.
please come in.
I wonder if you have a right to destroy a human being this way.
I don't mean just you, but the handling of The Paper.
Woltersheim. I've known Katharina since she was born.
I see the disease and damage in her.
because of The Paper? - Yes.
that's not our concern.
anyway, freedom of the press cannot be dealt with lightly.
but freedom and dignity of a man can be.
lf you avoid bad company, you don't give the press the wrong opportunities.
I won't take that kind of lesson, especially from a young man.
my colleague's age means nothing.
however, his position as D. A. means a lot.
in any event, I don't ask my guests to produce a police record.
your mother lives in East Germany and by her own choice.
she seems to prefer their system.
do many of your guests think the same way?
do I have to supply you with their political profile?
what are you investigating exactly?
let the state representative decide what are the important questions.
Mrs. Woltersheim!
is Katharina Blum's gentleman friend - let's leave aside whether - there's one or many of them among your guests, too?
absolutely not. Anyway, there's only one person, and the affair is in very bad taste.
by "bad taste," I don't mean Katharina, but the visitor.
and who is this visitor?
since Katharina didn't say, I won't either.
do you know him personally? - No.
but you claim to know all the details of Mrs. Blum's life.
did you know that, over the past few years, your Katharina has travelled over 50. 000 miles all over Germany, destination unknown?
don't you feel well?
here.
I went through the archive again, and I've picked out some more clippings.
here, for instance, they just mention a "Katharina B.."
no picture.
how do they know all that?
the value of the ring, all those lies about gentlemen friends?
that's The Paper.
is the state unable to protect you against this garbage?
not everybody reads The Paper.
all the people I know read The Paper.
have some tea? - Please.
tip me off. If she's released. She's what you're always looking for and never find.
a real gem.
well.
how's Ludwig?
I'm not expecting you to tell me where he is.
it wouldn't fit into your character.
let's forget what you've done.
let's assume you don't belong to Gordon's gang.
personally, I don't believe that you do.
let's imagine Katharina Blum, domestic help, above all suspicion.
how much do you earn?
1. 200 marks at Blorna's.
with extra income I make 1. 800 to 2. 000 marks.
what extra income?
I said all that yesterday. - That's the point.
we don't understand how, with this income - more or less your salary, Modin
how can you afford to buy a flat worth 110. 000 marks.
don't you have any other earnings or should we admit the loot of Gordon's robberies fills the hole in your budget?
I made a down payment for the flat: 7. 000 marks. From my savings.
the Blorna's vouched for a 30. 000 loan.
my monthly expenses, including interest, are about 1. 100 marks.
we just want to know how you make it.
perhaps we can learn how to get to own an apartment.
1. 100 per month.
our accountant has established that we should add another 150 per month that you send to your mother.
regular payments to a company - to take care of your father's grave. - Yes, twelve marks.
then something to your brother who is serving time.
I send him 10 to 20 marks for cigarettes and coffee.
he needs them.
don't you spend anything on clothes?
you don't always dress as economically as you did yesterday.
I fix up things that Mrs. Blorna gives me.
with this, I need your help.
I wonder where these gas bills come from.
I drive to Blorna's every morning. I drive back in the evening.
I do my errands on foot.
we've measured the distance.
the round trip is six kilometers.
in the evening, I work at Mr. Hiepertz'.
eight kilometers to the Hiepertz home and back.
from time to time, I visit my aunt. - 4 Kilometers.
on weekends, I go to a caterer's or I help out as a waitress at receptions, parties or weddings.
often, they're out of town. - Could we say about 30 a week?
a little less. - 30.
that comes to 8. 000 a year.
you own a Volkswagen, which you bought second-hand, according to the contract, from a Mr. Klommer, with a mileage of 56. 000.
lf we add 6 times 8. 000, it should come to 104. 000.
but in fact it shows 162. 000.
now and then she visits her mother in Gemmelsbroich.
50. 000 still remain unaccounted.
we have the gas bills.
where did you drive to so often?
what were you spying on?
whom did you meet and where?
that's right. I just added it up in my mind.
I never gave a thought about those expenses.
after work,
I often go for a drive.
mostly when it rains and when I'm alone.
sometimes I'm home at 5 with nothing to do.
I know so many women who get drunk alone in front of their TV.
that scares me.
goodbye. - Bye.
sick mother collapses.
what is Blum hiding? Are our interrogation methods too gentle?
our correspondent managed to find Blum's sick mother.
she complained bitterly that her daughter hadn't visited her for so long.
truth didn't catch her by surprise.
it had to come to this, she whispered in a dying voice."'
nobody is allowed near her!
hello.
you filthy pig. You filthy, cowardly pig!
just let me throw that crap away. - No, I'll read it.
no news from him.
a good fuck is half the battle.
this is rather prickly.
where Stalin didn't succeed, you won't either.
learn to pray again.
I'm the best lay. I'll will...
commie's WHORE
don't take it seriously.
I'll get rid of all this filth.
nice and cozy again here.
now you go to sleep.
Yes, I'll go home. - Why don't you stay here?
good night. - Good night.
is that you?
did you find it? Are you all right?
is there anything to eat?
don't worry. They're leaving me alone.
I know, but I had to hear your voice.
you...
I like you so much.
I'd like to be near you.
last night, I almost was on my way to you.
don't call anymore. I'll call you.
you told me not to speak of love.
but I still want to tell you that I'm very fond of you.
me too... very much.
saturday, FEBRUARY 8, 1975
this bullshit, following you everywhere.
I'll throw a bomb in their office.
is Alfred awake?
I have to speak to you about Katharina.
did you come back because of her?
you should be careful.
this Gordon belongs to a gang of deserters and objectors.
they are undermining our domestic security.
you sound like The Paper...
what's this got to do with Katharina?
haven't you read this crap?
the worst slanders against Trude and me!
did you come here to discuss the yellow press?
don't you want to come in?
you can throw a libel action against The Paper.
how could they get all that information if it wasn't from you?
this is not the time or the place for your accusations.
are you under surveillance too? - They're here to protect me.
I'll file an inquest to see if you collaborate with The Paper.
do as you want.
five days a week I work on radicals.
I want to have the weekend off.
what are you doing? - What do you want?
I'm with The Press. - Who are you?
move it.
leave us alone or I'll whack you in the face! Go away!
I recognized you right away. You're the broad's boss.
and this is the house with the swimming pool.
the coffee is very weak.
not like Katharina's. - Cut it out.
I'm not blaming you. - You couldn't if you wanted to.
with Katharina I could never... - Never do what?
take her in my arms.
not on your account. - Thanks.
you know what I mean.
on account of her.
she's so damned vulnerable.
I don't think Alois noticed that. - What's Alois got to do with it?
didn't it occur to you that he's the gentleman friend?
he thinks he's irresistible.
I know that from experience.
if it turns out it was Alois,
I'll punch him in the jaw.
help yourself. He just drove up.
come in.
good morning, Trude. - Hello, gentleman friend!
I suppose Trude was right.
I'm not sure that's very good taste.
good taste would be to be your wife's gentleman friend.
the heating isn't on yet.
do everything you can to find Katharina.
I'm sorry you couldn't get here before.
I don't want my name to appear.
you don't seem to be in the picture. - I've no idea.
that's weird, considering I happen to be your client.
why didn't you come by plane? - Because of the fog.
so you don't know where she is? - No.
do you?
Katharina called Totros an hour ago to offer him an exclusive interview.
there are other papers besides The Paper.
Totros can sell his articles through patsies.
I have nothing against making headlines, except in connection with anarchists.
why didn't you think of that before your "visits"?
an affair might at worst bring me into trouble at home, not in public.
we do live in a free country.
Hubert.
talk her out of this interview.
the worst hasn't come out yet in the interrogations or in the press.
six months ago, I made Katharina take the key to our place in the country.
sentimentality, I guess.
I do love the girl.
but you won't help her against The Paper. - You can't help her.
you can help me. She won't let you help her!
God damn it, Hubert.
you still don't understand.
I'm sure she gave the key to Gordon and he's hiding at my place now.
it's a good hideout.
why don't you call the police?
an anarchist in my house!
he must go away.
you could drive out there as my lawyer. - Me? - Yes.
to see if the snow drops are out?
do you really mean that?
these Paper-bastards must be watching me every minute.
if my name is printed in connection with this gang,
I'm through.
just out of the feeling you shouldn't get too involved for Katharina.
I'm not saying that for me, but for you.
sorry, Alois. - Then we'll have to part company.
two picture frames with portraits, a pair of health shoes, toilet articles in a plastic bag.
clothes are in the suitcase with an inventory.
Valuables: Two wedding rings, a pin, and 32. 50 marks in cash.
do you like it?
thank you.
if Totges actually was in her room,
I'll sue him.
but I think it's impossible that he had the nerve to do it.
I'll go to court.
I'll notify the Medical Association.
we can't prove it had a harmful effect, but we can't exclude it either.
the operation had been successful, and your mother was on the way to recovery.
these people are murderers. All of them.
it's their very business to rob innocent people of their honor, often to take their lives.
otherwise nobody would buy their papers.
are you a Marxist?
just a moment, please. Your mother is being prepared.
I would like to be there.
Maria and Teresa, our two helps.
are you her daughter? - Yes.
thank you for everything.
attention! This is the police!
the villa's owner, a well-known Executive and university professor, is also a major Party official.
it is not clear yet how Gordon could have broken into this well-protected place.
the owner, Professor Stabredel, has gone into retreat for the carnival period.
the house is surrounded by hills, as if by perfect watch towers.
special troops were landed at night by choppers, out of earshot, and went into action.
we waited for Gordon to make his contacts.
it was essential to find out whom he was trying to contact.
our success here has proven that it was a risk worth taking.
excuse me.
where is Ludwig? What happened?
we've already removed him. He's well.
just a bullet wound in the thigh.
what are you doing here?
all we know is he's a deserter from the Bundeswehr.
he damaged this blessed institution materially, not only morally.
he never robbed a bank.
he helped himself to the pay of two regiments.
actually, it's all my fault.
this is the blueprint for the heating and plumbing system of Katharina's building.
it was on the wall in our bedroom.
it fascinated Katharina. I told her exactly how high the passages are, where you can stand up straight, where you have to duck in order to fix pipes or wires.
Katharina, will you sit down?
today, we are going to spoil you.
without minimizing anything, what exactly happened?
you've been interrogated. So have we all.
the Paper smeared the usual crap on us.
they only spared me, perhaps just because I'm an old Nazi.
you can stay at my place if you won't go home.
here's my key.
Thanks. - I'm going to live with Else anyway.
life goes on.
so, Katharina. - How long will Ludwig get?
with this hysteria, I figure eight to ten years.
you really love him? - Yes.
why this interview, now that it's all over? Let me cancel it.
no, I want to see Totges.
I want to know what such a man looks like.
you're not up to his tricks. He'll fool you again.
at least let me come along.
I'd prefer to do it alone.

gordon CAUGHT - MOTHER DIES
first VICTIM OF ANARCHIST PARAMOUR
Hey, Katharina, is that you?
we'll have a beer for breakfast.
look over there. - It's the Blum girl.
you're in The Paper. Everyday!
we're saving the clippings.
how about a quickie?
she belongs in the gas chamber.
Cheers!
see, Blum, you're famous now.
all that mail, even on Sunday!
you can thank me for all that.
special delivery, telegrams,
just wait. You can make a lot of money on your name.
the story is still hot news, but we must keep plugging it or people will forget about you.
first an exclusive interview for a weekly magazine.
you're news. You have to exploit that.
here.
this is for the story on Stabredel.
that business with the key. We'll take care of the gentleman!
we'll club him over the head.
you have to be a bit more tolerant.
you're not blaming me for that Paper coverage?
they treated you a little rough. You're not mad at me?
I'll get through it and so will you.
I often get furious with the editors.
I deliver first-rate copy and they turn it into crap.
I have a lot of respect for you.
really!
what you've done... I take my hat off!
politically naive, of course.
we should get to know each other better.
this interview is just the beginning.
how about fucking for a start?
Schenel's corpse has been found in the woods. The Paper photographer.
he was shot.
did you kill him too?
well, why not him too?
epilogue
this is a very moving moment at the cemetery.
many of our prominent citizens are paying their last respects to the cold-blooded murdered journalist, Mr. Totges.
this is his mother, Mrs.Totges...
we recognize Mr. and Mrs. Str? ubleder
the shots that killed Werner Totges didn't hit him alone.
they were aimed at Freedom of the Press, one of the most precious values of our young Democracy.
and these shots - for us who stand here in grief and horror
they strike us.
just as they struck him.
who doesn't feel the wound?
who doesn't feel the sorrow above and beyond one's personal concerns?
who doesn't feel the breath of terror, the savagery of anarchy, the violence which is undermining the foundations of our liberal-democratic order, which we are so devoted to.
here, allegedly private motives have led to a political assassination, and we can say once more: Stop it before it grows!
look out, for Freedom of the Press is the core of everything:
well-being, social progress, democracy, pluralism, diversity of opinions.
and whoever attacks The Paper attacks us all.
to OUR COLLEAGUE- VICTIM OF HIS PROFESSION
editorial DEPARTMENT "THE PAPER
characters AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS
description OF CERTAIN JOURNALISTIC PRACTICES
are NEITHER INTENTIONAL NOR ACCIDENTAL
but UNAVOIDABLE
when I was a child in India,
growing up in the tiny village of Harenmahkeester,
I found a voice-over machine,
which I still use to this day.
I decided to use the Morgan Freeman setting.
I am his holiness the guru Pitka.
in my book, if you're happy and you know it, think again,
I speak of intimacy, or "into-me-l-see.
intimacy is like putting your wiener
on the table and having someone say, "that looks like a penis, only smaller.
only smaller.
though I was raised here in India, I was born in America,
which is where our journey begins.
it's the story of a hockey player named Darren Roanoke,
my most resistant student, who became my greatest teacher.
or some such bullshit. I don't know. gotta go!
Hi, I'm ! - and I'm Jay Kell.
tonight is all about champions.
but before we get going,
I'd like to start by thanking my own personal champions.
the fans who supported me with their cards and letters during my recent addiction to Peyote Buttons and Frangelico.
I've already apologized to my friends, my family, and my god.
and now, I'd like to apologize to dame judi dench
for my vicious and brutal attack.
I'm sorry, Judi, you did not deserve that,
and I hope the staples come out soon.
over to you, Trent.
Thanks, Jay!
tonight, the Toronto maple leafs' Darren Roanoke
is the subject of our player profile.
hockey has its legends.
now, the new one, Darren Roanoke.
known as the Tiger Woods of hockey,
Roanoke brought the sport to a whole new audience.
Hey, yo, check this, son! - check this!
a role model turned bad boy.
he was in a perfect marriage.
but before the playoffs,
he stunned the world by separating from his wife, Prudence.
from role model to dating models.
Roanoke found out his wife, Prudence,
was dating the l. a. kings' legendary
French-Canadian goalie,
jacques "le coq" grande.
he earned his nickname, "le coq,
for reasons that cannot be stated on this program.
this interview is over.
holy...
that's when Roanoke fell apart.
Roanoke is hit hard. open net! he misses!
damn, damn, damn!
but the question on everyone's mind is, can the leafs win without Roanoke?
well, can we win the cup without Roanoke?
not a chance, boss.
as long as Jacques "le coq" Grande is banging Darren's wife,
Darren's toast.
my father once told me the yankees hired a guru to turn their team around.
I have our guru.
if he can fix Darren, we win the cup.
they call him the love guru.
tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen
pour myself a cup of ambition
yawning, stretching, try to come to life
jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping
out on the streets the traffic starts jumping
with folks like me on the job from 9: 00 to 5: 00
working 9: 00 to 5: 00
what a way to make a living
barely getting by it's all taking and no giving
they just use your mind and they never give you credit
it's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
they let your dream just to watch them shatter
you're just a step on the boss man's ladder
but you've got dreams he'll never take away
you're in the same boat with a lot of your friends
waiting for the day your ship will come in
and the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way
working 9: 00 to 5: 00 for service and devotion
you would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
working 9: 00 to 5: 00
what a way to make a living
barely getting by it's all taking and no giving
they just use your mind and they never give you credit
it's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
working 9: 00 to 5: 00
what a way to make a living
barely getting by it's all taking and no giving
they just use your mind and they never give you credit
it's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
working 9: 00 to 5: 00, yeah!
here we go, here we go.
Mariska hargitay, Speedy. yeah.
ride 'em, cowboy.
Mariska hargitay, your holiness.
Rajneesh! mariska hargitay.
your manager Richard Pants is here.
Dick Pants. send him in.
Mariska hargitay, your holiness.
have you seen today's paper?
Oh, don't tell me,
it's another article about Deepak Chopra being number one
and me being number two?
not in as many words.
quaking pudding! I can't take this!
not again! what? why, why?
babu, to be the world's second most popular
Neo-eastern-self-help-spiritualist is no small thing.
thank you, Rajneesh. you are my compass
give me a pound.
lock it down.
break the pickle.
tickle, tickle.
you! - you!
well, no, you! - you!
no, no, no! you!
okay. you!
No! you!
stop it!
who's the gift basket from, Dick?
Brad and Angelina.
it says, "thank you for the gift of true intimacy, "but we've decided to work with Deepak instead.
what does Deepak Chopra have that I don't have?
he's been on Oprah.
Oprah!
and Oprah loves a great story. now, take a look at this.
the Toronto maple leafs will pay you $2 million,
if you can get Darren Roanoke back with his wife
in time to win the Stanley cup.
two million dollars!
that's a lot of cheese.
but wait, it gets better!
I spoke to Oprah's producers,
and if you can restore Darren Roanoke's marriage,
they guarantee that you will be on her show!
let me get this straight.
if I fix their marriage, I get on Oprah,
and if I get on Oprah, I'm the next Deepak Chopra!
Deepak Chopra. Maurice Pitka.
please enter the ashram of the guru Tugginmypudha.
guru Tugginmypudha, you are so good with nunchucks,
yet you are blind.
I am not blind.
I am just severely cross-eyed.
I know, it is weird.
be seated.
deepak, here you go.
Maurice, you're not of Indian blood.
speak of your parents.
they are both dead. they were missionaries.
and what did they do before then?
they were dog stylists.
so, let me get this straight.
they were into doggy style before the missionary position?
that's hilarious. my parents are dead. thanks.
deepak,
why do you want to join the Tugginmypudha ashram?
to seek my true self.
all right, kiss ass.
Maurice, why do you want to join?
I want to become a guru so girls will like me.
then I will like myself.
deepak, you will enjoy love in all forms.
Maurice, you must wear this chastity belt.
chastity belt? that sucks!
once you have learned
that self-love is more important than being loved by others,
you may remove the belt.
master, if I am not allowed to be with a woman, may I still...
you will go cross-eyed!
guaranteed.
Mariska hargitay. yeah. - Mariska hargitay.
I am his holiness, the guru Pitka.
welcome to my ashram,
the ecumenical intuitive enlightenment initiative organization,
or eieio.
guru pitka had a farm. - eieio.
and on that farm, he did no harm. - eieio.
okay.
if I sit like this any longer, I'm gonna pop my dink bag.
listen up. I am a guru.
let's look at the word "guru," okay?
my goal is to get you to say, "gee, you are you.
tm.
and the you of "guru" is intimacy.
or "into-me-l-see.
I see.
without intimacy, you feel nowhere.
tonight I want you to go from nowhere to "now here.
Yeah.
it's like in the electric company, you know?
now... - here.
nowhere. - nowhere.
my laws of intimacy are kind of like my bible.
and let's look at the word "bible," shall we?
the bible is "basic instructions before leaving earth.
tm.
put that shit on a t-shirt.
show the t-shirt.
now, I myself have a guru, guru Tugginmypudha.
and my guru, guru Tugginmypudha
had a guru, guru Cheddafrumunda.
and guru Cheddafrumunda
had a guru, guru Hathasmalvena.
guru Hathasmalvena had two main periods of his gita,
or words of wisdom.
the first period came before he got syphilis.
some pre-syphilitic words of wisdom include, "to know something is good.
to do something is god.
then, after he got syphilis, he would say things like, "eatin' ain't cheatin'.
did it smell that bad when you ate it?
liquor up front, poker in back.
but his point was this, "if you can't love yourself, you can't love another.
and that's the end of that one. yeah.
Mariska hargitay.
some announcements.
on friday, please join us
for our first annual gamblers anonymous monte carlo night.
Yeah. just for funzies, you know. bring your singles. yeah.
all right, good night, everyone! yeah!
thank you so much!
great show, guru Pitka.
Hey, any bears in the cave?
any bears? - Oh, yeah.
bear cub. left cave.
right here? - there. right there.
Yeah. right.
that little booger gave me a nose-whistle during the whole show.
now, I'm ready to receive.
Mariska hargitay, your holiness.
Mariska hargitay, Jessica Simpson.
did you get into the vip room okay?
I love you.
Mariska hargitay, your holiness.
Mariska hargitay, Val Kilmer.
why do you hurt me?
I know why. I know why.
Mariska hargitay, guru Pitka. - Mariska hargitay...
Mariska hargitay.
I so enjoyed your sutra,
especially the part about not being a victim.
well, thank you.
because you are such a generous benefactor,
we are establishing the "mariska hargitay special victims unit.
the whole nine yards.
thank you, your holiness.
you have gone from nowhere to now here.
I'm beautiful and I have a secret.
Yes.
guru Pitka, this is Jane Bullard, owner of the toronto maple leafs.
guru Pitka? - hold on one second.
guru Pitka?
No!
so, you are the owner of the ice hockey team,
the Toronto maple leaves?
actually, it's leafs. - who said that?
how did you get there?
this little guy scared the crap out of me.
I think I'm gonna have to do a panty check.
I might have some monkey-mustard back there.
no, I am good.
who is this prick?
well, how do you do? shrimp?
What'd you call me, jagamo?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your gnome... name!
you are a midget.
I find that term condescending!
condescending. that's a big word for you.
the man's an ass!
your holiness, you're an expert on love.
Yes, I am.
why do you think Darren Roanoke threw away his marriage?
well, in my book, I know you are, but what am I?
I explain that when love goes wrong...
nothing goes right. ...Nothing goes right.
Yes! - I've read it. it's impressive.
Yeah, it's nothing short of a masterpiece.
so, do you think you can come back with us to Toronto in the team jet?
it's a date. - is it, now?
well, this kitten's got a whip. meow!
this is great, your holiness!
I can see you now, spreading your message of self-Love - on Oprah. - Oprah!
he's finally here for the first time on the Oprah show.
welcome guru Pitka.
Oprah! come on, Oprah.
hello. thank you very much.
Mariska hargitay. thank you for the gift of water.
all right, I'm just gonna come out and say it.
I find your work really inspiring.
I actually went to one of your sutras after my father passed away.
I'm sorry to hear about your father.
have you read my book on the grieving process?
it's called, what's this? a dead one of these.
Yes. - oh, you have?
I especially like the chapter, "it might just be sleeping.
my favorite.
I've read all your books. - Oh. well.
to tell you the truth, I kind of have a schoolgirl crush.
Oh, really?
what does your husband think about this crush?
I'm not married.
boyfriend? - Nope.
girlfriend?
well, I mean, there was one time in college.
Really?
what was that? - I didn't hear anything.
well, it's hard to believe a girl like you can't find a man.
what does that mean, "a girl like me"?
well, come on, I don't have words for it.
you know, nice girl, intelligent,
bedroom eyes, pouty lips, great rack, tight bell-shaped ass,
thicker than a snicker...
say.
my problem with men is the Bullard curse.
what's a Bullard curse?
my father, Hank Bullard, bought the leafs in 1967.
and we haven't won a Stanley Cup since.
so, all the men in the city blame me and my family.
well, as I write in my book stop hitting yourself.
stop hitting yourself.
why are you still hitting yourself?
I explain that, people may say bad things about you,
but you must never say bad things about yourself.
I see someone who's ready for change.
it would just be easier to change,
if I didn't have to deal with the city that hates me.
Jane, the city of toronto doesn't hate you.
Oh, yeah, they do. - Oh, no, they don't.
Oh, yeah, they do. - Oh, no, they don't.
trust me.
at the arena, I had maintenance paint lines
to show me where the crowd can't see me.
you know, so they don't boo me and throw stuff at my head.
I mean, I didn't even ask for this job! I guess it's just my fate!
fate is a joke.
and as I once read on a wall, in a truck stop bathroom in barstow, "the joke is in your hands.
Oh, my god, I just got that!
well, to be more accurate, the joke was in Rajneesh's hands.
what?
nice shooting!
I am his holiness, the guru Pitka.
look, man, just get back on your pillow, all right?
there ain't no connection between my love life and my hockey.
I'm not here to work with you.
I just came by to say hello and goodbye.
goodbye? - Yeah.
I spoke with your wife, Prudence.
she broke it off with Grande, and now she wants you back!
Seriously? - Sure. you don't need me.
go back to what you were doing.
Yes!
there is one other thing.
I lied.
prudence is still with Jacques Grande,
and he still has the biggest wiener in hockey.
is it true? - Yes, he has a ginormous hog.
do you still think there is no connection between prudence and how crappy you are playing?
tell me this.
do you want Prudence back? - Of course I do.
then I need you to write Prudence an apology letter,
and I will go deliver it to her.
all bids for connection count.
what if it doesn't work? - I can always refund your misery.
I was ominous just then.
Grande's not going to like you talking to Prudence.
I know, but I must deliver this apology letter to her.
do you think Grande saw us?
of course not, Rajneesh.
we are completely hidden by this bush.
this may go badly.
keep the elephant running.
prudence?
my little cabbage?
while I do your calves, I'd like to sing a song
by the greatest singer ever from quebec, miss Celine Dion.
you were my strength when I was weak
you were my voice when I couldn't speak
you were my eyes when I...
you saw the best there was in me
No!
you were my eye...
do not peck my fucking eyes! don't peck my eyes!
lifted me up when I couldn't reach
you gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
because you love me
that was beautiful.
and now, I'd like to show my love by making for you a Quebec pizza.
what's that? - pop-tart with the ketchup.
she's good.
guru Pitka? what happened to you?
nothing. why do you ask?
we've not much time. I have an apology letter from Darren.
well, you know, I got attacked by a rooster. so, you know.
so he writes one stupid note and you expect me to take him back?
perhaps I can change him.
did someone order the special Quebec pizza, eh?
you know, like in the porno.
who is this in my house?
looks like he's smuggling a schnauzer.
let me show you out.
down, boy.
read the letter.
nice place, eh? - Yeah.
and I got her cheap.
so, it's an honor to have you here in my house, guru Pitka.
I think you are an amazing guru, and...
Hey! mister!
what did you do to my rooster?
I don't know what you're talking about.
stay away from my girlfriend!
the wolverine.
don't look at me with that tone of voice, or I punch you in the shirt!
okay, gotta go.
beat it. I gotta take a dump.
bodhisattva!
Hello, superstar. welcome to my new Toronto ashram.
uncle Jack.
can I get a hand getting off this elephant?
Darren, if your uncle jack helped you off an elephant,
would you help your uncle Jack off an elephant?
that's funny to you?
I don't know where I get it.
so did you give Prudence my apology letter or what?
Yes, of course! - did it work?
let me answer it this way.
you're an idiot. - yes, I am!
now, your entourage must stay behind.
no, no, no, no, no. they protect me.
well, they didn't protect you from that outfit, now, did they?
what?
what's wrong with shark skin?
more like gay-skin, how about. what? yeah.
snaps.
right, let's talk about Jacques Grande! - no!
leave that man out of this.
you feel inadequate,
because he has plenty of clarity, organization, charm, and knowledge.
tm.
Yeah, he's got a lot of that, all right.
therefore, he's able to say to Prudence, "be loving and open-hearted with my emotions.
tm.
you better stop right there.
Blowme is a good way to remember that. blowme, yeah.
Blowme.
you should stop. - well, I'm sure you're sick of this.
I know Prudence has had it up to here with Grande.
all right, you know what?
I can't move my body!
it is an Indian martial art known as "how to hurt a guy.
I am poking your third eye.
and if I twist my thumb, I can make you crap yourself!
so, what do you want me to do?
what I need is to get you to follow my method, drama.
we must distract you from your emotional pain,
regress you back to your childhood.
we must adjust your negativity, mature you, and put it all into action.
if you follow my method, not only will you win Stanley's Cup,
but you'll also get Prudence back.
you think this'll work?
depends. - Depends on what?
no, you might want to pick up some depends.
I may have twisted my thumb. yeah.
check for coins.
think fast.
students, now I am going to teach you the "d" of drama.
distraction.
Maurice, if Plato, Shakespeare and Einstein
were talking about the meaning of life,
and two elephants started humping outside,
even they would rush to the window.
it is the ultimate distraction.
we shall now compete in a game of tag.
it is called stink mop.
enter, Sanjay!
enter, Maurice.
commence stink mop.
stink mop! stink mop!
stink mop. - Go.
stink mop. - Stink mop!
Maurice.
what are you not thinking about?
I am not thinking about my chastity belt.
that is distraction. - Yes!
I get it! I am distracted!
good distraction frees us from emotional pain.
bad distraction gives you a mouth full of whizz.
once again, I'm Trent Lueders. - and I'm Jay Kell.
go, leafs, go! go, leafs, go!
tonight, game one of the Stanley Cup finals.
l. a. kings, Toronto maple leafs. it's gonna get ugly.
ugly. you want to hear ugly?
at promises, I shivved a guy with a sharpened toothbrush
because he bogarted the rehab toilet hooch
that I'd made from apples and pantyhose.
that was ugly.
over to you, Trent.
Thanks, Jay.
all right, guys. bring it in.
let's rip off their heads and shit down their necks!
Yeah!
go! go! - here we go!
now, the first lesson is distraction.
in order to learn distraction,
you're not allowed to fight anyone in today's hockey match.
I'm a hockey player!
that's what hockey players do. we fight!
it's a problem.
even Jay-z had 99 of them, and the bitch was not one of them.
now, do you want to win Stanley's Cup?
Yes, I wanna win the Stanley Cup!
then you are not allowed to fight anyone for any reason!
don't fight! now, get out there, and don't kill them.
what is that? - Corn dog.
what is it?
is it made from dog?
what a freaking idiot.
is this a dog's thingy? Am I being punk'd?
ladies and gentlemen, the leafs take the ice.
Hello, Los Angeles Kings.
I am his holiness, the guru Pitka.
and I have a message from Darren Roanoke.
he told me to tell you that you're all his bitches,
and that you can suck his big greasy...
Mariska hargitay.
I'm gonna kill you, Roanoke! - you're dead, Roanoke!
damn, Roanoke!
and we're getting ready to drop the puck for game one of the finals.
I know I'm excited, Jay. how are you? - I am rigid.
it's a yard sale!
what? - not to fight.
you are not to fight anyone.
you are not to fight anyone.
I would not wanna be his nutsack.
they're coming after Roanoke!
get up!
what the hell are you doing?
superstar, look at your hands.
they're not shaking! - Yes.
Roanoke with the puck. what a pass!
goal!
Roanoke may be fighting for his life,
but he's playing great!
rob Blake is lucky the refs didn't see that.
but the refs will see that on our post-game highlight reel.
that is the Altoids "curiously strong elbow to the face" of the game.
Oh, god. am I still dreaming?
no. why do you ask?
why'd you tell me not to fight?
because you are now distracted, therefore playing better.
it's the only way.
Yeah, well, I can't keep getting my ass kicked!
fine! fight anyone for any reason.
you just said don't fight...
what, it's just arbitrary with you? - of course not!
but we will let the dice decide.
Yes, it is arbitrary! fight anyone for any reason!
fight anyone.
it's a bench-clearing brawl!
remember, kids, this is not how you play hockey.
it's just ugly. - I like it.
that was a good one.
one game suspension, Roanoke!
way to go, Roanoke! you jag-off!
him, too? - Anyone for any reason.
I love my job!
two games! - Now, it's a two-game suspension.
that would mean Roanoke would be out for game two and three!
he could play in game four.
of course, we don't know if we're going to game five!
two and three, out, can't play in the game.
he could watch the game at home, but he can't play!
he can pretend to play while he's at home,
but he cannot play on the ice in the game that we're watching,
which is after this game, 'cause we're in game one.
you have a firm grasp of the obvious.
how could he do that?
are you all right?
I'd like to thank the academy. wow, these things are heavy. yeah.
put me down, a-hole! - Okay.
and the kings take the first game of the Stanley Cup finals.
damn it!
Cherkov, relax!
now, everyone, let's just take a seat. - okay.
first of all, let's agree next time
we decide to have a group meeting,
we take it in my office.
now, guru Pitka here obviously has a plan.
so, guru, enlighten us. what is your plan?
frankly, this is completely unexpected, and I'm scared shitless.
no, no! - let me at him!
take it easy, Frodo. - no! get back! no!
No! no!
hippie queer!
throw a hex on you. - Okay, okay.
isn't there any way that you could skip a step or two?
no way! with drama, there is no shortcuts.
we must now take him back to his childhood.
his childhood? - yes.
his mother only lives an hour away,
but he won't allow her to go to the games.
interesting.
he won't allow his mother to come to any of his games!
come, Rajneesh, a breakthrough!
little help, please!
okay. all right.
you're leaving? - Yes.
where are you going? - To see Darren.
Jane, I promise you, everything will be fine.
come by my ashram, then I will explain.
coach Cherkov, I would invite you,
but I know you have your meeting with the lollipop guild.
why won't you let your mother come to
come to any of your hockey games?
cause, man, I don't play well around her, man.
she freaks me out.
then tomorrow we will go to her!
Oh, hell no! oh, hell no! - Oh, hells yes!
this ain't driving miss Daisy, man.
I'll break your fingers.
okay. yo, this my street right here.
Tonawanda street. - Tonawanda street?
I know this street.
you do? - Yes.
at what number did you live? - fifty-three.
do you know a Dickie Withers at 85?
no. - well, it does.
a dickie does wither at 85. I own you! yeah!
Yeah! you are laughing!
you see, you're filled with joy of a child!
you are now ready to meet your ma.
I'm warning you, gp, my mom's tough.
Oh, please. how bad can she be?
raise it up and make a joyful noise
Oh, I shall not be moved - no, no, no, no - no, I shall not be moved
no, no
lead me to your rock
where I shall not be
I shall not be moved
remember, Darren, you must stand up to her.
got it.
baby boy. - Oh, mom.
now, why won't you let your ma come see you play?
it's just that you're not always the most supportive, ma.
supportive?
pressure makes diamonds.
pressure also makes rubble.
and after a good whipping, cream rises to the top.
so does scum!
you're the guru Pitka. - Yes, I am.
you're like the poor man's Deepak Chopra.
game over.
Oh, mom, don't, don't. - do you have something to say to me?
Yes, you do. yes, go ahead.
Yes.
you change your hair color? Cause it looks nice.
we'll talk in the car.
well, this was fun.
and by fun, of course I mean emotionally scarring.
I know you are not trying to tell me how to raise my child.
gotta go.
superstar! superstar, wait! - whoa!
look at you. you're jumpy. you're like prison bitch jumpy.
I told you that we shouldn't have come here.
no, no, no, no, no.
we have to go back in there and confront your mother.
there has to be another way.
well, I hear you rappin', sister mccrappin'.
okay, there are two ways to regress you.
one involves your mother, your shame core,
and a grueling process of intense self-examination.
what's the other way? - well...
what does this sound like?
I am making diarrhea sounds with my cup.
I'm regressing you.
someone's in here. someone's in here!
Yes. you are laughing!
why am I laughing, man?
look what you did to my jacket.
Ball-gazer!
go ahead!
you bastard. you totally caught me in a ball-gaze.
congratulations, you have been regressed.
I own you!
Yes, you own me. - That was easy.
but with ownership comes responsibility.
it was at this point that I realized
that my student was finally shedding his defenses.
what are you doing?
he said while eating a chicken wing.
I am talking into my voice-over machine.
so, the leafs lose game two by a whopping six-to-one score.
the leafs look rattled without Roanoke.
it's Darren Roanoke. - you mean roan-choke more like.
that's great. nice hat.
I had a hat like that once. - yeah?
then my mom got a job.
looks like I'm gonna have to
shove these love beads someplace special.
you got a problem?
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. let me handle this.
there are two things about violence
they teach you when becoming a guru.
the first thing is,
an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind.
the second thing is,
never ever watch the bottle.
you son of a bitch!
it's a bar fight!
down, down!
watch out!
well done! - Nice job!
hold on, hold on.
Niagara falls is amazing.
Darren.
just because your mother only loved you
when you achieved
doesn't mean that Prudence will only love you when you achieve.
I was afraid that Prudence would leave me if I didn't win the stanley cup, - so I left prudence first. - that's it!
however, we must confront your mother.
prudence always wanted me to stand up to my ma.
I know. - I miss Prudence.
I miss the connection.
connection. - Yeah.
making love. falling asleep in each other's arms.
sometimes we would wake up a couple hours later,
and it'd be like we were the only two people in the world.
prudence would stare into my eyes, and she'd say...
damn. - Damn.
it sort of became our song.
you are a very lucky man.
I would like to have a "damn" moment like that someday.
how can you be the love guru if you've never been in a relationship?
well, there is someone I like.
but until I learn to love myself,
I can only go out with three girls named Ann.
three girls named Ann? - Yeah.
Ann visible, Ann flatable, and Ann job.
Ann job!
well, you know, I deflect because of the pain.
I gotta get my girl back, gp.
otherwise, what am I gonna do with this?
I have two tattoos.
one tattoo is the drama tattoo,
which signifies the self-determinist philosophy
of the Tugginmypudha ashram.
and what's the other tattoo?
daffy duck pushing a lawn mower through my pubes.
look, he's dancing. yeah. right.
Ball-gazer! oh, my god! there you go!
the ball-gazing student has become the ball-gazing master.
saying I love you - saying I love you
is not the words I want to hear from you
it's not that I want you not to say
but if you only knew
how easy it would be to - show me how you feel - show me how you feel - more than words - more than words - more than words - more than words - is all you have to do to make it
real - is all you have to do to make it real - then you wouldn't have to say - then you wouldn't have to say - that you love me - that you love me - 'cause I'd already know - 'cause I'd already know - more than words - more than words - more than words - more than words
that was great!
thank you, Speedy. that's great.
Mariska hargitay. that's great.
that was lovely. but we need to talk about Darren.
this is a disaster. he's my only...
Jane! do you trust me?
I do trust you.
I'm not really sure why.
it's the beard. It makes me look like santa.
and by the way, you look breathtaking.
thank you. - as do I.
come. my staff has prepared a lovely meal.
Wow. - Right?
I am so hungry I could eat a skunk's bottom.
which is a lot like calamari.
but that's not what we're having tonight.
Rajneesh will now prepare a dish
made of two lychees wrapped in a doughy pouch.
it's called Kartapal Birigalapatt. - What's that mean?
nuts in a sling.
Oh, thanks, but I'll pass.
very well, I'll have your nuts in a sling.
cough.
reject this man. Not fit for military service.
would you like your nuts to be crushed?
doesn't everyone? Who is this guy?
Geronimo!
that is our safe word.
now, we get the nuts nice and hot, so they tighten up and get firm.
that's good.
feels good. I mean, tastes good. I mean, what?
you want curlies on your nuts?
do I look like a child? of course I want curlies on my nuts.
don't forget your pickle.
would you like some soup instead? - Yes.
Rajneesh, I'd like an alligator soup, and make it snappy.
because alligators are snappy, and at the same time, I want it prompt.
here it is. there's your soup. watch out! it's dangerous!
you're as cute as pie.
I haven't laughed like this in such a long time.
why not?
it's hard to laugh when men only see you as some curse.
Jane, there is no curse.
you're just afraid of intimacy, or into-me-l-see.
remember, being vulnerable is being woundable.
I say take the risk.
well, that's easy to say and hard to do. - is it?
what's the downside of throwing away your fear?
the only way out is in.
I think I'm about to risk something.
what's wrong? - We can't do this.
what? you tell me to be vulnerable,
and then you turn around and wound me?
I can explain. - Okay, go ahead.
I can't explain.
I should go. - no, Jane, wait! I...
Jane! jane!
game three here in Los Angeles.
the L. A. kings have beaten the leafs.
they are one game away from a Stanley Cup victory.
they can't be happy in the leafs' locker room right now.
I'm sorry, I blacked out for a second. have they dropped the puck?
damn it! we're down three games
because you decided you couldn't win without Roanoke.
and you! you're just a stupid rich girl!
you were born on third, and you think you hit a triple!
you don't know hockey!
are you finished? - No!
now I'm finished! and, pitka! - Yes?
what's the capital of thailand? - Bangkok.
exactly.
omar sharif, my balls!
my balls, you prick!
stay down, bitch! - Okay.
Jane! Jane, wait!
he's right! I'm just a stupid rich girl about to be a huge failure.
failure? there's no such thing as failure.
only early attempts at success.
you know what? I hired you to fix darren roanoke.
do your job!
your holiness, I spoke with the producers at oprah,
and if they don't see Darren and Prudence together by the next game,
your spot will go to Deepak.
but Darren is not ready!
he must truly deal with his mother.
and I will not take a shortcut. - Take a shortcut!
do you want to be the next Deepak Chopra or not?
babu, you cannot take a shortcut.
but I need to become the next Deepak Chopra!
but how will you get grande away from Prudence?
I have one idea that just might work. yeah.
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the incredible miss Celine Dion!
Celine! it is my day of lucky!
what'll you have?
a martini. - All right, then.
jacques Grande. is he "Mr. Right" or "Mr. Right now?
jacques and I get along just fine.
you have, what we call in the guru business, "love without knowledge.
but what you had with Darren is love with knowledge.
a real connection.
come by my ashram tomorrow at noon.
I will show you a Darren who is completely changed.
do you think he's really changed?
I mean, he can't even play in front of his own mother.
she's like kryptonite to him.
can't play in front of his mother?
Hey! I said stay away from the girl!
Rajneesh, let's make like a baby and head out.
so you went to see your mother? - Yes.
but did you stand up to her?
he doesn't have to stand up to his mother.
Yes, he does! - not now, Kato.
now, aren't there a few more steps in your drama plan?
Yes. maturity and action. - Beat it, Rajneesh.
Yes. We did maturity and action.
M" and "a" spells "ma,
and we went to buffalo and we saw his ma.
right. see?
you see, I left 'cause I was scared that if I didn't win the Stanley Cup,
you would leave me.
but I don't care if you win the Stanley Cup.
can you forgive me?
of course I can forgive you.
stick a fork in them, they're done.
champers wishes!
it would be great if you could stick around for a while.
you know, just to make sure Darren's okay.
Yes, of course. Yeah, business. Yes, of course.
would his holiness staying on qualify as an extension?
because if that were the case, we would refuse payment.
of course, I'll stay, Jane.
until we get the call from Oprah.
go to your naughty mat, dick!
miss Bullard.
Mariska hargitay.
your holiness mark my words, this shortcut will haunt you.
Congratulations. - well done.
game four here in Los Angeles.
the kings are one win away from a Stanley Cup victory.
Ro-an-choke! Ro-an-choke! - Ro-an-choke! Ro-an-choke!
Ro-an-choke! Ro-an-choke! - Ro-an-choke! Ro-an-choke!
this is it, folks. game four.
if Roanoke doesn't pull through,
it's all over for the leafs.
Roanoke with the puck.
he shoots! he scores!
wasting no time after his suspension, he is back!
the end of game four, and the Leafs take it two to zero.
thanks to Roanoke, the Leafs advance to game five.
go Leafs.
game five here in Los Angeles. can the Leafs do it again?
Roanoke just playing amazing!
goal! and game five goes to the Leafs! an incredible comeback!
thanks to Roanoke, the Leafs have got the kings on the run.
and look at this crowd! they are guru crazy!
game six here in Toronto!
beautiful pass!
go! go! go!
Roanoke on a breakaway! five-hole trap!
Grande saves! Roanoke denied!
once again, I'm Trent Lueders.
and I'm Jay Kell.
Roanoke fell for the five-hole trap.
for those of you who don't know what that is, allow me to "kellistrate.
there are four holes. one for each corner.
the five-hole is here, between the legs.
you can try to beat him here. or here. or even way down here.
Thanks, Jay. let's get back to the action.
Roanoke has done it! we're all tied!
the Leafs have won three straight games!
game seven will be in Toronto.
it's down to one game.
get me out of here, pricks!
...Champion. I just got the call. you are 100% booked on Oprah.
great.
I got on Oprah, right?
I'm the next Deepak Chopra, right? - You are.
he's definitely in.
doesn't feel good, does it? - get off my tits!
Congratulations.
Darren and Prudence are back together, we got a shot at winning the cup,
and you got on Oprah. I suppose all that's left is...
the check.
Yeah. here we go.
Oh, my pretty. miss bullard, it has been terrific.
now, if any of your other players have any professional catastrophe,
personal pain, or a drug addiction, please do not hesitate to call.
your holiness, the check and I will be in the car.
cheerio. - Bye.
I guess you got everything you wanted.
not everything, Jane.
well, say there was this guru, say.
and this guru was, you know, handsome, you know,
had a nice gleam in his eye, a nice tuck in his butt, say.
and say this guru, maybe not me, maybe somebody else,
had a certain vow.
what kind of vow?
forget about it. just etch a sketch everything I was saying.
Mariska hargitay.
Mariska hargitay.
well, here we go. game seven.
it all comes down to this, ladies and gentlemen.
who do you like tonight, Jay?
Jay?
I like the christmas babies, Trent!
and I like the way my skin feels when I'm wearing my rainbow jacket!
by your command.
you're back on drugs, aren't you?
Yes, I am, asshole-face man!
by the power of gahar, I command thee to vanish!
let's see what's happening rinkside. - No!
well, here comes lucy the elephant.
I cannot be killed but with fire!
the Deluca brothers circus is coming to town.
isn't that just adorable?
well, whoever wins tonight walks away stanley cup champions.
listen up! it's down to one game, and we've got the momentum!
why you got your heads down?
we can beat these clowns.
besides, I still have a few trick on my sleeve.
flight 22 to Chicago is now boarding at gate five.
our plane leaves in 20 minutes.
the people at Oprah are very excited!
that's great.
ladies and gentlemen, here to sing the star-spangled banner,
mother of Leafs' center, Darren Roanoke,
Lillian Roanoke.
that's Darren's mother! quaking pudding!
Hi, baby!
what do I do?
I don't know!
Oh, say, can you see
by the dawn's early light
what so proudly we hailed
Roanoke is freaking out...
what do I do? what do I do? what do I do?
no, no! nothing to see here.
our plane is about to leave for Oprah,
and we have to go realize every dream we've ever had.
I am not going with you, Dick.
Oh, no! no!
if you don't get on that plane,
I will take 60 percent of the ashram!
fine. I don't need material things.
I was put on this earth to spread a message of peace and love.
give me that ticket! give me it! - no! please, no!
you will never be the next Deepak Chopra!
what?
box him out!
Oh, damn.
at the end of the first period,
the Kings lead the Leafs, one to nothing.
and the question on everyone's mind is, where's Roanoke?
baby, are you all right?
I can't play in front of you, ma!
it's all my fault for not putting more pressure on you to succeed.
Yes. - Hello?
Jane, I'm on my way.
I thought you said he was cured! - I was wrong.
tell coach Cherkov to buy some time!
okay.
sir, please, please make sure it's locked, sir.
please, over there.
thank you. thank you, sir.
dell computers, this is chip.
Rajneesh, I... wait a second, who is chip?
I took another job.
Rajneesh, you have to come meet me!
I must finish my job with Darren.
you're back, babu! - yes!
bodhisattva!
Boo! you suck, bullard! - No, you suck!
you can say bad things about me, but I won't say bad things about myself!
so, guess what? you can all just kiss my canadian ass!
Cherkov, Pitka's coming. you...
are you as turned on as I am right now?
you're a bad, bad person.
I'll take that as a yes.
Pitka's coming. just stall.
Hey, ref! time-out!
leafs call their last time-out.
Darren? - come on, baby.
Jane! - you lied to me!
Yes. I only pulled away from you because of this.
my name is the guru Pitka, and I wear a chastity belt.
so, you didn't reject me. you're just devoted to a higher purpose.
Yes, Jane.
superstar, it's me, guru Pitka!
good luck. he won't even let me in.
Darren, I took a shortcut with you, and I'm sorry.
now, what is it you can't face?
what did you say to me? - What is it you can't face?
I can't face my ma. - Then that's what you have to face.
will you help me? - I can't.
will you help me? - I can't.
you're on your own when it comes to your mother.
Darren, the only way out is in.
Yes, yes, yes, it's good.
it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good.
what the hell happened to you?
ma! I'm a grown man, and I can take it from here.
I love you.
I love you, baby boy.
now, how long will it take you to get dressed and get down to the ice?
five minutes. - Well, you better hurry up, 'cause there's only six minutes left in the game!
go, baby boy! go, go, go, go, go!
I think I made a happy wee-wee. yeah.
come on. let's go quickly! come on. come, come. hello?
action picks up here in game seven with only 31 seconds left to go.
coach, I'm ready. - Get in there!
Darren Roanoke is in the game!
Hey, Rob Blake. the first thing they teach you about hockey
is never ever watch the puck.
Roanoke's going for the ice slam!
we're all tied up, folks, with only eight seconds left!
this is it, folks.
Roanoke on the breakaway, just him and Grande!
with one second left! it's a penalty shot.
Roanoke could win the Stanley Cup here.
listen, Darren, I know we are rivals, but fate chose these sides, not us.
so, before you take this shot, I just need to say
Damn!
show it to me.
Damn!
I don't know what Grande just said to Roanoke, but he is now out to lunch.
superstar! what did he say to you?
he said, "damn!
damn!" quaking pudding. that's not good.
Cherkov, call a time-out. - We're out of time-outs.
just buy us some time.
he needs a distraction. Jane, follow me!
he's gotta take the shot, now!
I promised myself I'd never do this.
Hey, ref! I'm having a heart attack.
out of the way! coach! coach!
get the crash kit!
sir, may I borrow your elephant, lucy? - sure.
bodhisattva!
come, come! come on, boy! elephant coming through!
come on, Bodhi! let's go quickly! come on, Bodhi!
clear!
get busy, Bodhi.
eight seconds!
what do you make of this?
I think they're doing it, Trent. I think they're doing it hard.
let's go to the Kellistrator.
the ultimate distraction!
I love you. - I love you.
Post-ejaculation, the barbs at the tip of the penis retract.
Bing-bam-boom, you got a baby pachyderm. back to you, Trent.
now, what happens if you don't score this goal?
I'd still be a hero
to me!
Yes! "gee, you are you." tm.
go get 'em!
come on, Roanoke! let's go!
Five-hole!
No!
five-hole trap!
the Toronto maple Leafs have won the Stanley Cup!
I love hockey! I love hockey! - I love hockey, too!
they did it!
the curse is over for the Leafs, and I need to sleep!
we didn't waste time. we didn't waste no time.
Maurice? - Deepak Chopra!
oprah called me, and she said you canceled.
I told her she should give you another chance.
as great as you are, I don't need to become the next Deepak Chopra.
I am the first guru Pitka!
you are free.
you're a good man, Deepak Chopra.
Hey, Pitka? sorry I punched you in the nuts.
that's okay. Give me a hug.
if you ever sucker punch me again,
I'll kick your ass all the way back to the keebler factory.
give me a pound. Lock it down.
break the pickle. tickle, tickle.
you. - No, you.
come on now, you. - No, you.
well, no, you.
and so our story ends where it all began,
here in the tiny Indian village of Harenmahkeester,
in the valley of Lintinmybelli.
Maurice. - Oh, my god. you look so beautiful.
thank you.
Maurice. you have finally learned to love yourself.
you may now renounce your vow of chastity.
may I have the key?
there is no key. there never was.
there's a snap in the back.
thank you, guru Tugginmypudha. Yeah.
are you leaving?
the last rule of guru is to rid student of the need of guru.
Yes, of course.
okay, see you.
doesn't work sometimes.
so, what do you want to do now?
well, I've been wearing this belt since I was 12 years old.
what do you think I want to do now?
I want to sing!
some people call me the space cowboy, yeah
some call me the gangster of love
some people call me Maurice
because I speak of the pompatus of love 'cause I'm a picker I'm a grinner - I'm a lover - I'm a lover - and I'm a sinner - and I'm a sinner - I play my music in the sun - I play my music in the sun - I'm a joker - I'm a joker - I'm a smoker - I'm a smoker - I'm a midnight toker - I'm a midnight toker - I get my loving on the run - I get my loving on the run
I am the love guru, yeah
he's a picker he's a grinner
he's a lover he's a sinner
he plays his music in the sun
I'm a joker I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I get my loving on the run
starting mark.
Hey, peter, can we move the camera in?
all I can see is asses.
now you know what it's like.
Hey, sis. Good run?
I'm not your sister - kay, foster sister
like that better, anyways.
so many more possibilities. - You are such a perv.
you so read things into what I say. - I don't think so.
now, if you don't mind... - Only if you close those blinds.
Hey. - Hey. There you are.
we just got back to Phoenix. - Wait. Wait.
Don't...Let me look at you.
my twin sister. I still cannot get over this.
Oh, it's been three months. Just get over it.
I just can't wait to finally meet you. Hey, and now that you're home...
I know, I know, I'm really excited, too, but you understand why we have to wait.
Yeah, I know. You're searching for our real parents.
and if it wasn't for that search, I never would have found you.
Yeah. - What?
just... the couple that adopted you sound really cool.
I mean, they obviously love you. - Then why did they lie to me?
well, maybe they're just trying to protect you.
no. They want to protect themselves, okay?
they lied; they knew that I had a twin and they didn't tell me.
why wouldn't they just tell me?
you know what? No, I'm going to tell you why.
because they did something horrible,
Emma, but it's fine, because I'm back, and I'm on it, and soon enough, I'm going to find out the answers.
okay.
I always say,"Hope is grief's best music.
that's really brilliant, Emma.
you got the smart half of the embryo, didn't you?
it's something I read in a book.
who are you talking to? - None of your business!
Hey, Laurel, welcome home. Is Sutton here?
Luke, I'm afraid I have bad news.
Sutton was killed in a tragic barge accident on the Seine, making me the last available Mercer female.
Laurel, stop! Luke, don't listen to her.
I wouldn't think of it, Mrs. Mercer.
welcome home. How was Paris? - I had a wonderful time.
nearly perfect.
do you believe Sutton turned down our day at the museum?
don't start, Mom.
Hey. - Hey - You can still go with Laurel. - Yeah, absolutely.
besides, I'm sure you and Luke have a lot of, you know... catching up to do.
Hey, Luke. - Hey.
nice to see you. Good summer?
Oh, it was pretty boring without Sutton around, but what are you gonna do?
okay, I'm gonna go,'cause this is really weird.
I'm going to Char's house; she's having a welcome home thing going for me.
Luke. - See ya.
everything unpacked?
my mistake, discussing things in front of the boyfriend. - Honey...
daughters pull away from their mothers.
that's a natural part of growing up.
we did the right thing. We did all we could.
I hope so.
I missed you. - Me, too.
Really? 'Cause I barely heard from you.
I just... It was crazy busy, and I got distracted.
but even before you left, you were acting kind of weird.
look, it's... just something I need to work out on my own.
you get that, right?
okay, so, if it's okay, I need a girlfriend fix.
see you tomorrow?
kind of a waste of time, isn't it?
your school doesn't even have a tennis team.
and even if it did, it's not...
what's the idea?
bash it hard enough, you escape this messed-up life?
don't touch me. - Why not?
Emma, you need to, like, accept your situation here.
in my mind... - You don't have a mind.
there's five and a half inches between your ears, and it's basically empty.
so just stay the hell away from me.
Emma! Travis! Get in here!
$500, including a hundred-dollar tip signed by none other than Mr. Bruce Willis himself.
who got into my kitty?
ma, I didn't even know you had a kitty. - Emma?
Oh, I get it. I-I see what this is.
Yeah, you're a klepto. Ma. check her backpack.
think I will. - Clarice, don't you get it?
he took your money; he takes it all the time.
to my lucky penny, Clarice. Love, Bruce Willis.
he took it. - You are so full of it.
be quiet, both of you.
social Services said if anything like this happens, I'm supposed to call the cops.
and that's just what I think I'm going to do.
watch her, Travis.
Ah, love it. The outfit, the hair... Good old Sutton.
we barely survived without you, right, Mads?
somehow we managed. Hi. - Hi.
we just missed having our "orifice." - Actually, that's "oracle.
I'm sure you guys were great without me.
Hey, Char, how's your mom? - Oh, great.
out of rehab. Detoxing. Getting lots of sleep.
so no change, in other words.
it's okay. And if you want to talk about it...
no way. I'm not going to let it get me down.
school's about to start, Sutton's back, all's right with the world.
how's Thayer? You talk to him, right?
Ah, occasionally. What about you?
Yeah. Couple times. He seems to really like L. A.
well, freaks me out Thayer would just leave like that.
I mean, you and your brother were so close, Mads.
Chars, come here! - Duty calls.
Yikes.
I found it in the back of a drawer, and I don't recognize the place.
this was up in the hills.
um... hiking trip, I think.
you must've been sick or something.
so, I gotta ask...
you and Thayer...
you were never more than just friends, right?
please. No. He's your brother.
I mean, he's like my brother.
sorry. Just curious. - It's okay.
wait here. I'll go get them.
that didn't take long. Ma's going to give them an earful.
you know, I still might be able to help you out here.
promise me a little action, and I can make those cops go away.
I mean, you are getting kind of close to three strikes.
ma, she's going out the backdoor.
stop right there!
you just ditched him? Luke can wait.
I wanted to be with my best friends.
but, God, Luke's, like, your boyfriend.
I know that.
so do you want to break up with him, are you cheating, or both?
none of the above.
so... Come on, share.
it's complicated. I found something out, and it may be the first thing I can't share with you guys.
I have to take this.
sounds like family stuff.
it's always family stuff.
Emma, what's up?
I'm coming to Phoenix tonight. There's an all-night bus.
whoa, back up.
look, my pervy foster brother set me up and said I was stealing.
I have nowhere else to go.
Sutton? Sutton, are you there?
Yeah, just thinking.
I know that you said that you didn't want to spring this on your adopted family, but...
n-no, that's okay, we'll work it out.
what time does your bus get in? - 8: 50 a. m.
okay, yeah, I'll be there to pick you up at the station.
I got to go.
it's you.
it's me in the flesh.
on the computer, it just never felt real, you know?
Yeah, I know.
everything about us it the same: the hair and the eyes.
look, we don't have a lot of time. - For what?
okay, I can't go into detail, but last night, I got a lead on our real parents.
what, you found them? - I don't know.
there've been a lot of dead ends till now.
but here's the problem: this lead leads to Los Angeles.
so you want me to go to L. A?
no. I'm gonna go to L. A. and you're gonna stay here and cover for me.
my adoptives would never get this.
they would just freak out and blow everything.
Hello?
just a minute. We need to change clothes.
wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You-you-you want me to take your place?
two days. Just hang out, relax, enjoy.
you said you envy everything I've got.
I never really said "envy.
look, you're in this trouble, right? So what better place to hide out?
like I said this summer, my sister's totally annoying and my parents lied to me.
anything else you need to know is on my computer.
has my whole life on that thing.
take this. The other key to me-- my phone.
I have so wanted one of these. Okay, well, that was envy.
Oh, I do this hair flip thing. - So, like this?
I don't even know your address.
my BMW's in the parking lot. Nav system has my address.
just push "preset one," she'll take you right home.
so I just... be you.
don't say anything to anybody, especially my so-called parents.
look, I'm gonna find our real parents.
I'm gonna find the truth. Come here.
dude! A little privacy?
so, in two days we'll meet up at the cabin.
preset four" on the nav system. 10: 00 p. m.two days only, I promise.
if I had a day with you... - Yeah, this L. A. thing can't wait.
Oh, and the boyfriend sitch, you should really know about that-- it's complicated.
Hey, look, I'm gonna call ya, okay?
after 600 feet, turn left.
you have arrived.
Oh, my God.
Sutton, there you are. Sure came home late last night.
then out again first thing this morning at... Oh!
I got it.
um, where should I put this? - Where it always goes.
thank you, Sutton.
sorry about this morning. I just had stuff I had to do.
what, pawning Grandma's necklace?
Oh, my God, I don't think I've ever seen you without it.
Luke probably took it off last night to give you a proper "Welcome home" hickey.
by the way, Mads asked me to swim with you guys.
she can't wait to see r new bikinis.
don't suppose I can have a ride. - Yeah, I guess.
Hey, look, I'm sure that the necklace will turn up.
I hope so. Something happened to it, your grandmother will be devastated.
and we would never hear the end of it.
bunch of shirts if anybody's going by the dry cleaners.
it has to wait till Monday.
unless, Sutton, on your way... - Sure, no problem.
Oh, my God, that's twice. - Laurel...
anything else you need me to do? - Okay, that's it.
who are you and what have you done with my daughter?
I'm off.
see ya. Have a good day.
hello. Hey.
wear that bikini "Wear your bikini.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
okay, Emma, let's channel Sutton. Sutton, Sutton, Sutton.
those shoes, I love them. Oh, pocket change.
Paris? Paris was just...
Paris... Okay.
yo! - Oh, hi!
we better get going if you're still taking me.
okay.
you drive.
I'm sorry. What did you say?
you have your permit, right?
and you know the way to Mads' house and the dry cleaners.
I know I probably said I'd never let you drive my car.
actually, you said "Never sit in it," but not arguing.
not saying a word.
Hey!
Hey, Laurel, where's Sutton?
right over there.
cute cover-up. You get that in Paris?
and when did you get so modest?
stylish, sexy, sophisticated and oh, so chic.
you look great, babe. - Thanks.
you had a good summer?
Yeah, we kinda went over that last night.
right. Last night.
hold on.
Hello? - It's me. Can you talk?
not really. - It's going okay?
sort of. - Good,'cause it's going well here.
who's that? - I set up a meeting...
I gotta go. Call me later?
when I get a chance. Remember, two days, the cabin.
my mom. Sorry. What were we saying? I've just been really distracted.
I know. That's what you also said last night.
see? I'm so distracted, I completely forgot about that. Sorry.
but, hey, you look beautiful.
Thanks.
what did he say? - He said I am beautiful.
Aw. Aw, you guys are so back. I was worried there for a second.
I dunno, Char, kinda got the feeling there's something Sutton's not telling us.
well, come on. You know what they say.
boyfriend sitches, always complicated. - Always complicated.
huge party at my place two nights from now.
it's mostly seniors, but you guys can come.
Nisha, don't exactly remember inviting you.
look who's finally home.
how's the knee, Sutton?
it's good. Ready to take you down, Nisha.
Wow. Shaking in my Nikes.
is that a challenge, Sutton?
I-I guess it is.
well, you sure went down easily last year.
you know, people are still saying you faked the knee to avoid the humiliation.
we'll just see what happens.
how about tomorrow, first day of practice, you against me.
then we'll see who's number one.
you're on. - Good.
have a nice day.
you okay? - Yeah.
I'll be ready for her. - Nice work, babe.
it's about time someone stood up to her.
have Mom and Dad ever talked about my adoption?
you're kidding, right?
I mean, anything more than what they always say.
right, that they chose you and that makes you special.
me, the big surprise, comes along, like, ten months later.
I read this thing that said the baby of the family always craves attention, which is why we tend to be so obnoxious.
I just think they aren't telling us everything.
of course they're not-- they're parents.
I'm getting the distinct sense of de-javoo.
that conversation on the plane home, you asked,"Who has a child and just gives it away?
obviously you were talking about who gave you up.
Yeah, I'm sure I was.
well, I'd imagine whoever it was could see into the future, and knew what a nightmare you'd turn into.
changed your tone.
I like it.
please enter your password.
you have one new message.
Hey, Emma, Travis here.
thought you'd want to know you're in some serious trouble.
ma's pushing the assault charge. Cops took like a million pictures of my face.
not smart running the way you did. So where exactly are you?
you okay? - Yeah.
I thought I just saw someone out there, but...
I don't know, I must've imagined it.
I was kind of talking in general. Sit.
you've been a little different since we got back.
so people have been telling me.
well, if it matters or not, I like it.
you do? - Yeah.
it's nice to know we have each other to rely on.
how Brady Bunch was that?
I loved that show.
you hated it.
well, I'm a teenager. I'm allowed to change my mind.
you know what I mean though, right? A family is a great thing.
Yeah.
it's what I wanted my whole life. - It's what you've had your whole life.
right.
you know, when you were a kid, it was right about now that you would ask for a hug.
am I too old now?
you go to bed soon, okay? You have a big day tomorrow.
good night.
first day of school. And you're still asleep.
figured you'd already be dressed.
the whole school's going to be dying to see what what Sutton Mercer is wearing.
little curious, myself. Better hurry.
you said this would be fun, Sutton.
it finally is.
these are amazing.
last time I made you pancakes, you refused to touch them.
Pancakes-- strictly verboten on the Sutton lean, mean, fighting machine diet.
Oh. Well, I guess pancakes are my new tofu.
I'll be in the car.
the miracle was getting you to sit still long enough for that photo.
I was a fussy baby.
very defiant.
did you guys want one kid or two?
I, uh... I don't...
I just meant, was I supposed to be an only child?
Yes. We adopted you, and then Laurel was a surprise.
it was supposed to be impossible.
just like that, you had the complete family.
look...
I mean, think about it--you could be living just about anywhere.
Yeah, I think I did okay, considering the alternative.
I mean, if no one adopted me.
Really? Are there still orphanages?
I think some. I think it's mostly foster families and I heard that those can get pretty awful.
Ah, yes, Scottsdale's own Ethan Whitehorse.
most likely guy in high school to get into serious trouble, and most unlikely guy to have a brother who's a cop.
all right, later, sis. If I don't see you, good luck against Nisha.
Thanks.
Hey, Sutton. - Hi.
Hey, Sutton. Love the shoes. - Yeah. Thanks.
Hey, Sutton. - Hey, girl. Hey.
Hey, cute. - Thanks.
so, out of the blue, my mom has, like, this "lurid" moment and starts going on about you.
I think you mean "lucid.
your mom was talking about me? - It was weird.
I still can't get over the fact they all went to high school together-- our parents.
too bad they don't still get along.
not like us. Friends for life, right, Sutton?
for life.
babe.
what, are we just going to give up our table?
no. No.
I think they got back together.
am I nuts or are people staring at us?
Yeah, I guess.
everyone's wondering if we're still a couple.
how do you know that? - Just stuff I heard.
so are we still a couple?
cause, I don't know, sometimes I kind of think that you take us for granted.
I really appreciate you and...
I appreciate this and I would be crazy to take it for granted.
you're looking at me the way you used to.
I... - Come on.
follow me.
now, this, I didn't want anyone to see.
with everything that's been going on, I just...
I haven't been able to say what I wanted to say for two days.
I'm glad you're back, Sutton.
Thanks.
it's really weird. I...
I feel like there is something you're not telling me.
actually, there's something that you can tell me.
how the hell am I going to survive against Nisha today?
Oh, well, uh...
you've got a great backhand, so use it, and, hey, don't forget, you're better than you think you are.
Yes.
okay, are you, like, Humpty Dumpty or something?
because every time I see you, you're on a wall.
and you know what? If Luke knew that you were stalking me, he'd be really pissed.
stalking you? - What else would you call it?
I guess just about anything else.
Hey, that was you last night outside my window, wasn't it?
of course it was.
Hey, where's your gym bag? Huh?
probably left it on the courts. That was like every day last year.
that's horrible-- actually kissing.
and I know that you like Luke, and I do too. It's just...
do I confront him? - Well, yeah.
I mean, you can't let someone do that to you, and the alternative would be to pretend you didn't see anything. It's...
right.
and leaving something out isn't a lie.
some people say that.
I think a lie's a lie, but if the reasons are reasonable, then maybe you can forgive the lie.
your father and I love you so much, Sutton. We chose you.
we would do anything for you.
and... I think...I think that's all that matters.
it is. It is.
and I know I haven't really appreciated all that you guys have done.
you and Dad.
but I just need you to know that no matter what happens, I love you.
I love you both, and...I'm sorry for the way that I've... been.
Or...the way that I think I was this summer.
I'm so sorry, too.
what's the point?
10: 00 p. m. it's all over.
what happens at 10: 00 p. m.
is this a Cinderella thing?
I should just tell you. - Tell me what?
you're not dressed.
don't say you're not going.
all of Arroyo High knows you kicked Nisha's ass, and they want to see the fireworks.
sounds like she's got someplace else to be.
what is wrong with you guys?
so what if it's Nisha-Lucretia, it's still a party.
with seniors, glorious seniors.
you guys are amazing, you know that. Right?
you're really scaring me, Sutton. Now, get dressed so we can go.
why don't you go pick something out of my closet? You know it better than I do.
char! Hey!
thought we were coming together to this.
came with my friends.
okay. You want to explain this?
what? - This. The cold shoulder.
sorry, Luke. Guess I'm just having a little trouble trusting you right now.
Hey, hey, babe, babe. Just come here.
stop.
I saw you with Nisha. Okay? At the tennis courts?
so how long has that been going on? All summer? Or just since I've been back?
Sutton... - I'm going to vote "all summer.
Sutton, you were avoiding me. You were, you were distracted.
so what was that today?
your lips just accidentally ran into Nisha's?
baby, she kissed me.
and I-I told her it was over, and it was a summer thing, and that you and I had talked. Remember? The auditorium?
he doesn't give a crap about you. You won nothing today.
you got lucky. You have never been in my league, and you never will be.
Oh, you know what, Nisha?
I have known people like you my entire life.
in fact, I have actually wanted to be like you at one point, but all you do is put people down, and somehow you think that makes you better than anybody else.
at least it doesn't make me a poser.
what? - Truth is...you were abandoned, Sutton.
even your real mother didn't want you.
get her out of here! Now!
or I swear to God I call the cops!
that was beautiful.
where you going? I'll come with.
I'm good. I'm just going to go home.
good night.
see you later. - Sure.
I'm really tired of this game.
No! Get out of my car. Get out. I didn't even know you were here.
Yeah, you didn't look. Humpty was on the wall.
I knew it. You're not Sutton.
I'm right, aren't I? You're not Sutton. You're someone else.
you're a pain in my ass. - See, Sutton would never say that.
shut up. - Or that.
go away. - Or that!
I am Sutton. S-U-T-T...
just forget it. Forget it.
all right. If you're Sutton, fine. Prove it.
prove you're Sutton. Answer me one question.
who's your boyfriend? - Luke Coburn is my boyfriend.
or at least was. - Or never was.
I'm Sutton's boyfriend.
Sutton and I have been seeing each other for nearly a year.
we texted the entire time she was in Paris and Skyped and talked.
you know, I had a feeling about you first time I saw you.
then on the court with Nisha, then you accuse me of being a stalker, and that kiss just now-- you might look like her...
you don't kiss like her.
you done? - Soon as you tell me where the real Sutton is.
you're looking at her, and now you're looking at her walking away.
so you ready to tell me who you are, where you've come from, and what the hell you've done with Sutton?
all right, I can go to Sutton's parents if that's what you want, or my brother, the cop.
all right... I'm not Sutton.
I am her twin sister Emma.
my name is Emma Becker.
Oh, God, you have no idea how many times I have wanted to say that in the last two days.
we switched places when I got here.
man, two whole days.
you fooled everyone. - Except you.
all it took was a kiss.
so you're running from the law in Nevada.
that explains why you're here, but the switch...
Sutton didn't want me to tell anybody, especially her family.
this has to do with her search for her real parents, doesn't it?
she told you? - I know she's been looking into it, and I'm guessing, except for you, I am the only other person who knows.
what's it like being Sutton?
well, let's see.
I broke up with her fake boyfriend, I accused her real boyfriend of being a stalker.
with her parents, I tried to help, except that backfired, and... well, at least with her sister, I think I managed to actually fix something.
she said her whole life is on her computer, and I went through that thing over and over again.
guess she had a lot of secrets.
she said that she'd be here at 10: 00.
I don't know why she wouldn't call if she got delayed or e-mail or text or
I have her phone-- I had it.
Sutton was always losing it, too.
this switch was really important to her.
that's why I've done everything that I can to make it work.
then you have to keep it up.
we both do.
so I go on being Sutton. - Until she comes back.
I got home first, and the alarm was going off.
alarm company said it went off at exactly 10: 15.
what's going on? - Oh, thank God. Where were you?
I went for a walk and I left my phone in my car.
someone broke into the house, into your room. We think maybe Laurel scared them away.
we need to take a look around, see if anything's missing.
the laptop's gone.
is that it? - Looks like it.
also, according to Madeline Rybak, you left the party early.
where were you, Sutton?
she was asking a lot of questions about her mother this summer, right?
I told her what I always tell her.
the woman is dead.
what are we gonna tell her when she finds out that isn't true?
you didn't steal anything?
you brought me love; just returning the favor.
we can't do this. You should go.
when did this happen?
since the first moment I saw her.
when Sutton gets back, Ethan, what happens?
you're Sutton's boyfriend. - I know.
we're gonna get a read on that water tower behind your mom and Emma.
Oh, my God, this is amazing.
that's my room. My crib was right on that wall.
I can't believe I'm standing in the place where our mother lived.
we used to fall asleep, staring at those stars.
wait, there's something there.
our mother's name was Annie Hobbs.
everything looks great, Phyllis.
I have to say, we've really outdone ourselves this year.
the kids are going to be blown away.
it gets bigger every year.
back in the day, ours were just as big.
back in the day...
I keep telling Char to enjoy these things, these events.
they all happen so quickly.
wish I could get my Char to run.
certainly has the time now.
somebody's been practicing. Oh, don't stop my account.
so, they really go all out for Homecoming here, huh?
was it like this at your old school? - I wouldn't know.
you had to be asked.
come on. Like guys weren't hitting on you all the time.
unless you count my pervy foster brother, Travis, no.
my friend Lexi and I would just go to the movies.
I'm guessing... you're not going.
good guess.
Yeah, you're right, these high school dances, they're just so lame.
you kind of looked like you were having a real good time a second ago.
that? Yeah. Yeah, no, I was just, I was just...
I don't really know what that was.
Yeah. - Yeah.
okay, fine, I admit it, I do want to go to this thing, but... it doesn't matter what I want.
what would Sutton want? Is she anti-Homecoming, too?
you are going to mak a beautiful Homecoming Queen.
I am?
I know talking about it jinxes it, but you'd better get some posters up
I've seen Nisha's everywhere.
and what about those catchy slogans you and Char came up with?
we... have to work out some of the kinks.
what is this?
the school has asked for photos from past years' dances.
you look beautiful. - Thank you.
your dad and Alec, they were big men on campus.
Oh-ho... - Kind of cheesy.
Yeah, that hair.
there's you. Two days old.
so sweet.
guess how many Annie Hobbs there are in the world.
523 in the continental U. S. alone.
how did you find these?
you don't want to know how easy it is to steal Social Security numbers off the Internet.
you did this when I was in the shower?
no. Last night.
I couldn't sleep, so it was either that or watch the Hoarders marathon.
so what's next?
we need to cross-reference with DMV records state by state, see if we can get a picture off a driver's license.
okay. Well, Emma was in foster care in Nevada, so let's start there.
okay.
how long is this rain gonna last?
day or two.
the roof leaks, but... it's kind of cozy, right?
I guess.
but I told Justin I would go with him before I got grounded.
doesn't that mean I'm grandfathered in or something?
you're not going to the dance, period.
he's running for Homecoming King-- he needs my support.
what he needs is a miracle.
he's new at school, right? - Yes.
and don't you always say we should root for the underdog?
you can root from home.
mom, you know how important Homecoming is.
I think your father's right.
you stole your sister's laptop. You tried to blame an innocent kid.
you can't expect us to pretend like it didn't happen.
so unfair!
so?
parole denied.
I was hoping...
what, you were worried I was going to miss your acceptance speech?
right. Acceptance speech.
Hey, Laurel.
you've done so much for me and Ethan, you know, the whole laptop confession...
I... can't go without you. It wouldn't be fair.
you'll get over it. - No, I won't. I won't.
so I'm not gonna go. I'm gonna skip the dance.
sister solidarity. Right?
and... we'll stay here, we'll do makeovers, eat junk food...
and what about the grand plan?
Sutton Mercer wins Queen junior year, wins again senior year.
by the way, you pull that off, and you'll get your own shelf in the trophy case.
right now you're more important.
seriously, if you hadn't come forward like you did, Ethan would be in jail.
well, I suppose you do owe me.
exactly. So girls' night, it is.
I missed you at rehearsal last night.
I tweaked a hamstring in gym class, so... I thought I'd give it a rest.
so you're okay, then? I mean, after what happened.
I kissed you; I shouldn't have done that.
look, Mads, I think you are an amazing dancer, and...
I don't want things to be awkward between us.
not with the recital coming up.
I came over to see if there was a... a problem.
you could have told me all that over the phone.
Mads, I'm home.
you stay in here. - Why?
we weren't doing anything.
you know my dad-- if he finds me with you, he'll freak.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, honey.
Hey. I thought you didn't get back until tomorrow.
uh, the conference wrapped up early, and I took an early flight home.
you okay? You feel a little warm.
might be coming down with something.
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff going around. - Yeah, yeah, I hear.
you good enough to go to school? - Uh, yeah.
all right, go get ready.
I got some calls to make.
Hello?
Dr. Hughes, it's Alec Rybak. Did you check Annie Hobbs day log?
Yes, and she hasn't had any visitors since the last time you were here.
you're absolutely certain?
our security's airtight.
for what I'm paying, it'd better be.
this visitor you're concerned about, will it be a man or a woman?
it's a girl. Teenager. She calls herself Sutton Mercer.
now, I'm guessing she's looking for a payday. She's gonna be making a lot of crazy claims.
I can send you a picture, if that'd be helpful.
got it. Sutton Mercer.
thank you, Doctor. Keep an eye out
your sister's pulling out. Why should I? For the exact same reason.
well, because... because, because I should totally be dating the Homecoming King.
the truth finally comes out.
let me put it another way.
this is the social equivalent to... winning the Masters.
but instead of getting a green jacket, you go from transfer student to Arroyo's hottest bachelor.
but... I'm taken.
taken?
God, that does have a wonderful ring to it.
look, you do realize the guys from the team put me on the ballot as a joke, right?
general pop doesn't know that.
all they know is that you're new and cute and interesting.
now... what you need is a good campaign manager...
and luckily, my services are available.
first order of business... visibility.
vote Justin for Homecoming King.
vote for him.
Hey, I can't believe you're dropping out of the race.
Nisha's got virtually no competition, and if she wins, I can't even imagine.
okay, well, if it means that much to her, maybe we should just...
let her win. Are you kidding? We'd be creating a monster.
I'm doing it for Laurel, okay?
she's so bummed that she's missing the dance.
Hey, guys. I'm gonna hit the plaza after school.
shop for a Homecoming dress-- who wants to join?
very regal, very Kate Middleton.
Sutton's not running.
right. So, like I was saying, something totally royal, with just a hint of the unexpected.
char, no, really, I'm sitting this one out.
I don't get it.
we've been planning your campaign since eighth grade.
I'm the Pippa to your Kate, remember?
I've got four campaign posters in the works.
my mom saw them and said, why don't I run?
well, why don't you run?
Sutton, I told you a million times, I'm a behind-the-scenes girl.
ladies, looking lovely.
save it, Nisha, we're not voting for you.
like I even need your votes now that it's basically a one-woman race.
was up for the competition, Sutton, but I'm sure you have your reasons for not running.
and I assume you're bringing your new boy toy to the dance, or is that still on the DL?
actually, I'm going solo.
but why don't you ask Eduardo? Went so well last time.
please, the dude is cute but hardly my type.
you're dating Eduardo?
for, like, six months.
I guess I wasn't the only one in the dark on this one.
I just said I was to save face with Nisha.
because she likes him, too.
and you know how she gets when there's a trophy on the line.
no matches in Nevada or Utah.
moving on to Idaho.
I was thinking, what if Annie Hobbs is hiding from us, from me?
have a little faith in the ones and zeros.
okay, we are going to track her down.
what if she just doesn't want to be found?
Emma was right-- I should just go back to Phoenix. I have wasted enough of your time.
you should really be working on your app.
look, at least we have a decent chance of finding Annie. Okay?
as for me creating the next Angry Birds, look at me.
I'm living in a leaky apartment, taking handouts from my sister.
not exactly feeling like the next Steve Jobs.
are you kidding? You are going to be a huge success.
Sutton. - No, seriously, really.
you are super smart, and you are the most dedicated guy I know.
honestly, if it weren't for you, I would have given up on this search so long ago.
you have been amazing. I mean that, really.
uh, I should go find that circuit breaker.
I'm starting to think that my dropping out of the race is a big mistake.
no, you're doing the right thing.
but no one seems to buy that Sutton would give up the chance to be queen.
because she wouldn't.
so you're saying I should run?
personally, I never understood why she was so into it in the first place.
maybe I should just ask her what to do.
every day I am here, it's like I am losing a little piece of myself.
you're not.
you're still Emma, and you're never going to be Sutton.
gee, thanks for the encouragement.
I wasn't saying it as a bad thing.
nice.
really, you think so?
definitely. Where'd you learn to draw like this?
just kind of always been able to do it.
you're lucky.
only thing I was born with was my dad's right hook.
Oh, that's it.
what, what's it?
what if I got this from my mother?
no, Sutton found that mural in my bedroom of the night sky.
those stars weren't stenciled, They were painted by my mother. She even signed it.
what if Annie Hobbs was an artist?
okay, that's all for today. Thank you, girls.
Hey, about this morning... - We can't talk here.
Mr. Rybak, what a nice surprise.
Hi, Nisha, I didn't know you took ballet.
I don't; just dropping off a check for a few private lessons I took with Eduardo.
you must be so proud of Mads, having the lead in the recital.
Yeah.
between you and me, I never believed the rumors about her and Eduardo.
what rumors?
Nisha. - A rumor-- probably nothing to it, nothing at all.
I mean, that's why they call them rumors, right?
right.
what did she want?
nothing.
no, she was just talking about some crazy rumors about you and Eduardo.
she is so... I've already told you, there is nothing going on between me and Eduardo.
he's an amazing choreographer and he's a perfect gentleman.
honey, it's my experience, there is no such thing as a perfect gentleman.
Hey, you want something to eat?
no, I'll get something later.
come on, sit down, I made some steaks.
so listen, uh... about the laptop, I'm sorry, you were right, I should have trusted you on that.
can't say it surprises me that Laurel Mercer was behind it.
those sisters are nothing but trouble.
you don't know anything about 'em.
I know that I was almost suspended last year without pay because of one of Sutton's little lying games.
she's different now.
she cares more about people, about her family... about me.
is she still keeping you a secret from her friends?
so what if she is?
I know that the last thing you want to hear is my opinion.
but I've been there.
if someone's trying to hide the fact that they're with you, it's not a real relationship, man.
girls like Sutton Mercer-- you can park their cars, but you just can't date 'em.
come on, Sutton, where are you?
Hey, sport.
Hi. - What are you doing?
I was picking out pictures of your Homecoming to send over to the school.
they're doing some sort of display or something.
who talked me into a pink tie?
Oh, wait, oh, that was me.
nice.
live, you learn.
I love this picture.
who... took it again? I don't remember what you had told me.
the guy from the adoption agency.
Oh, right, right, the baby broker.
baby broker? Honey, we used an adoption agency.
okay.
Hey, did the adoption agency ever tell you what my birth mother did for a living?
honey, we've been over this.
I know, just-- I don't know, she could be anything.
she could have been, um, a doctor or a waitress, artist.
you'd better get that.
Hello?
easy there, tiger, it's just us.
check it out.
isn't it fantastic?
char got the guy at the copy shop to do the layout for free.
had to show a little leg, but it was totally worth it.
guys.
I know you want to stay home with Laurel, but Nisha crossed a line, saying something to my dad.
if that's the only reason-- because of Nisha-- I think maybe it's time to just try and make peace.
again? Please.
you have to do it, Sutton, for us, for me.
I've already started on the acceptance speech.
see, we've done all the leg work.
now all you have to do is just radiate.
good morning, sweetheart. - Morning.
so I wanted to talk to you guys about something.
it's about Laurel.
I was kind of hoping you would reconsider letting her go to Homecoming.
did your sister put you up to this?
no, no. She has no idea I'm out here.
I just don't understand. She stole your things, blamed your boyfriend.
I know, and I was really mad, and she told me why she did it, and it...
look, I know in the past, I haven't been a great sister to her, but I just want the chance to fix it.
please, for me? For us?
everyone take one, pass them around. Vote for Sutton.
you've obviously got the jocks and cheerleaders on your side, but we need to build your base.
now, today's sche-- vote Sutton.
whatever you say, Char.
who's that?
couple classes together, definitely fringe.
another group we need to work on.
so your schedule for today:
12: 00-- lunch with the yearbook staff, 2: 00 p. m.-- hand out cupcakes to the marching band.
cupcakes, really?
um, Nisha's got a big lead. If we want to beat her, we have to dig deep.
don't be late to the lunch.
okay.
so much for sister solidarity.
Sutton Mercer, back in the race.
Laurel... - Just when I thought there was actual hope for us.
Laurel, stop. You can go to the dance.
what? Since when?
since I worked my magic with Mom and Dad.
I mean, technically, you're still grounded, but they said they'd spring you for the night.
now... go tell your candidate the good news.
Hi. - Hey.
um, I can go to the dance.
to-to the dance? - All right.
what's with the text?
so, I guess this means you're running.
got to say, I'm surprised Sutton's cool with it.
I keep trying to reach her, but I can't get through.
you know, this campaign has taken on a life of its own.
char has me booked back-to-back, schmoozing voters and, you know, to be honest, I'm not really a people person, not like Sutton.
just be yourself.
I can't be me and her at the same time.
I'm playing this part, and it has its perks.
but... okay, listen, I know that you're not into high school functions, but it's gonna be a really crazy night, and it would be really great if I had my boy... my one real friend there.
Sutton has made it pretty clear she doesn't want people to see us together.
I'm her secret boyfriend, remember?
well, we don't have to go... together, together.
I mean, we can... You can stay on the other side of the room if you wanted to.
I... Just knowing that you're there and close-- I think it would help me pull it off.
please?
I can't.
I can't.
close your eyes.
okay, open.
I thought it might come in handy while you're getting ready for the dance.
you can try it with different hairstyles, see which one looks best, and you've always had such beautiful hair.
I-I think... I think you should wear it down.
mom? - Or up. Up is fantastic.
I know you're really happy that I'm running for queen.
what if I lose?
I just... I don't want to let you down.
it's not possible.
I got to go get dinner ready. Okay.
Hey. Oh, I am so glad you called.
so, I have this theory that Annie Hobbs was an artist, and I figured it out when...
excuse me. Is that my my mom's tiara?
homecoming is coming up.
and, what, you're running?
I've been trying to tell you, but I just couldn't reach you.
well, the power's been down.
I wanted to pull out of the race, but people were starting to get suspicious.
it's really honestly the only reason why I am doing this, because I have to.
well, you can say no, okay?
I tried.
you don't understand what it's been like... - I know what it's been like.
just don't try and pretend like... like... you don't really want this.
I've never thought that I would be able to run for something like this and actually have a shot.
and to have parents and a family-- it's truly a gift.
more like a hand-me-down... from me.
look, I know that this is your life... - Yes, it is.
and just remember, it's not you they care about.
Sutton... - Have fun at the dance.
I'm working my butt off here in L. A.and Emma is-is totally out of control.
she's messing up my plan. She is stealing my life, one yearbook page at a time.
she's really trying.
of course. No, you're right. I-I'm... I'm sorry.
I... I'm just... I'm really missing you.
I would give anything to be on the back of your bike, wrapping my arms around you.
and what about Homecoming?
we'd meet up after, go for a ride.
or I could come with you.
please. You wouldn't be caught dead at a high school dance.
maybe I'd be willing to make an exception.
well, I'm stuck in L. A. So, don't have to worry about that.
but if you were here...
you still don't want anyone to know about us?
I thought we felt the same way about this.
you were never planning on taking us public. I mean, that's the reality here.
Ethan... - No. Stop, all right? Forget it.
it's all real clear.
Thanks.
no matter who you voted for, Sutton says it's just important that you voted.
x goes to Sutton Mercer. What does that get me?
a cupcake... but not much else.
see you, Derek.
Hey! - Hi.
Hey, great game!
Oh, my God, thank God you're here.
Hi.
we thought the queen might be late for her own coronation.
I feel like I'm on display.
in this game, that's a good thing.
according to the latest exit polls, I'm up by 40 votes.
Oh, well, did you stuff the ballot box yourself, or did you have your friends do it for you?
game's over, Sutton.
the only thing you're going repeat is remedial French... in summer school.
I can't wait to see her face when Sutton wins.
it's going to be epic.
Mads, what's your dad doing here?
chaperone.
he lives for this stuff. Gets to work the floor, relive his glory days.
hit on the single moms.
what? It's true.
he knows my mom's still married to my dad, right?
I was tidying up Sutton's room, and found something... strange.
did you know she could draw, like this?
I had no idea.
some of these are pretty good.
maybe we should encourage her, see if she wants to take a class at the college, or...
Yeah. It's a good idea.
I was thinking... Do you think one of her biological parents could have been an artist, and maybe if we contacted the adoption agency and just asked...?
so they can tell us what they told us 17 years ago
Sutton's mother was a troubled young woman, she didn't even know who got her pregnant?
maybe. I'm...
I'm just starting to think we made a mistake, telling her she died.
I mean, if I was adopted, I'd be curious about my birth mother.
I'd probably want to meet her. It's only natural.
the woman had severe emotional problems and a history of drug abuse.
for all we know, she probably is dead.
okay, and even if she's not, call me overprotective, but I don't want to see Sutton get hurt.
I suppose you're right.
Hey. - If this is about Mads, I kind of just want to stay out of it.
no. I just wanted to wish you luck tonight.
thank you.
you've had your eye on this tiara since you were, what, five?
it's got to be incredible, you know, being so close to getting everything you wanted.
I guess.
you always were that girl who'd stop at nothing, take no prisoners.
I have to check my makeup.
have fun tonight.
and if you win, keep your ego in check.
you don't want to forget who you really are.
all right, attention, everyone!
everyone, may I have your attention, please? - Here we go.
now... - Where were you?
uh, outside. - The moment of truth.
it's time to announce Arroyo High School's 2011 Homecoming Court.
well, well.
everyone, please join me in congratulating the new Homecoming Queen, a star on the tennis court in her own right. and a champion
the winner is Miss Sutton Mercer.
we did it!
what are you waiting for? Go on. Go greet yo people.
Oh, wait! Your speech.
fellow classmates, esteemed teachers...
you don't know how much this means to me.
I especially want to thank my two best friends-- Char Chamberlin and Mads Rybak-- for believing in me.
I have always dreamed of something like this, and just never thought it was possible, so... here I am... I guess.
you don't realize you want something until you let yourself want it, so...
thank you.
well said. Congratulations, Sutton.
and... the new Homecoming King is... indeed, a newcomer-- Mr. Justin Miller.
Oh, my... oh, my God, you actually won! This is just insane! Go!
and just be handsome.
got to say, I admire you for keeping a brave face.
and I am surprised to see you out and about after certain recent revelations.
I thought the D. A. would have you on lockdown.
well, whatever you said to my dad, he didn't buy it for one second.
could've fooled me.
thank you.
and now it's time for our King and Queen's first dance.
this is surreal.
you have no idea.
you mind if I cut in?
what are you doing?
I Thought nobody was supposed to see us together.
I don't care who knows.
what about Sutton?
this isn't about Sutton.
I came here for you.
I never would've pegged you for the tuxedo type.
me, neither.
it turns out I was just waiting for the right girl to ask me.
Hey, where did you go? We have some celebrating to do.
everything okay? - Yeah. It's just...
nothing.
no, no, wait, wait, what is it?
it's just... last year I'm Laurel Mercer, like, A.P. Dork, and now I have this amazing boyfriend, and...
thanks to my newly awesome sister, I get to see his... coronation.
it's nice when things work out.
and you deserve... all of it.
then why do I feel like it's all going to end somehow?
well, if it makes it any better, amazing boyfriend isn't going anywhere.
you're the best thing that's happened to me since I got here.
I'm not gonna let you go.
got another job for you.
Oh, man. I thought we were done.
you're gonna like this one.
yo, so what's the job?
I can't believe Sutton is slumming it with Ethan Whitehorse.
did you have any idea she was even seeing him?
no. And after I confided in her about Eduardo. Eventually.
Hey, why aren't you guys dancing?
not really feeling it.
I'm gonna go get us something to drink.
I'll see you in a minute.
okay, this isn't really happening, right?
okay, Char, I... know that you're not crazy about Ethan, but... he's a really great guy.
to sneak around with, maybe, but to actually date?
how long has this been going on?
almost... a year now.
and you never thought to tell your best friends?
what is with all the secrets around here?
can I talk to you for a second?
yeah?
what is this?
I thought you said there wasn't anything between you and Eduardo.
I... told you, there's nothing going on, Dad.
that was... we were in the middle of rehearsing a scene for the recital...
Maddy, I've got a pretty good ear for lies; you want to try again?
all right, it wasn't a rehearsal.
I kind of threw myself at him.
but he didn't want anything to do with me, so...
was he there when I got home the other morning? Was he in the house?
Yes, but it's not what you're thinking. He...
wait, Dad, where are you going?
don't ask questions you already know the answer to.
you keep doing that, you'll break it.
where are you going? - Out.
what if you stayed? - Why should I?
whoa, hold on, hold on.
are you sure about this?
okay. Never mind, forget I said that.
Mr. Rybak. - You expecting someone else?
listen... I never laid a hand on Mads.
I know, I know . you're not stupid.
actually, that's not why I'm here.
I don't understand.
let me get it.
Maddy, why don't you go home. - No, Dad.
I've got this.
Hey.
Hi.
I got your text.
what's going on?
our birth mother, Annie Hobbs, she's from Scottsdale.
I think this is her... with Ted and Alec.
do not let this girl anywhere near Ms. Hobbs.
understood? - Got it.
and make sure the rest of the staff knows as well.
Ethan! You're still so clearly into Sutton.
Alec paid me.
I don't know what you mean.
about you.
you need to step out. - No, I...
I came to find my birth mother, and you've held me here against my will.
what? What is going on? I thought I was going home.
you are, Emma. Home to Vegas.
I wanted tonight to be special.
I'm really starting to fall for you, Laurel.
I'm not gonna go anywhere, okay?
you have to.
my pervy foster brother set me up and said I was stealing.
Hey, Emma.
so you've got a twin. What'd you do, kill her?
I really need to get that.
is that so?
maybe you'd like a mani-pedi, too.
your caseworker gets here, you get your call.
Travis, school is out of the question.
I told you where we'd meet, so be there or forget it.
Hey, everything okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
was that Sutton?
are you serious? She hasn't spoken to me since she saw those pictures of us kissing at homecoming.
well, there were a lot of them. Guess she's still jealous.
Why? It's not like we're a couple.
no one said we were.
you want to tell me what's going on?
I mean, yesterday, we were getting along fine, and now, all of a sudden, I'm bothering the hell out of you.
let's just say, you can't run from your past.
sooner or later, it'll track you down.
I don't know what people around here have been telling you about me, - but there's... - Sorry.
no, not you. Not you.
it's about my life.
is that Sutton?
or not.
I can't be late for class. - Wait, wait, come here.
look, I realize I screwed up, all right?
you and I make a pretty good team.
just let me help you.
I'm sorry, I just - I have a lot on my plate right now.
moved?
no, that's not possible. We were just there last night.
well, moved where?
uh, well, can you tell me the address of this new place?
confidential? Why would it be confidential?
at the request of his mother?
okay, thanks.
Oh, my God. Guys, they moved Eduardo to another hospital.
if I hadn't told him my feelings, none of this would've even happened.
that's not true. - You can't say that.
okay, I'm sorry, guys. Maybe I should just go.
no. Not on my watch.
we're gonna go inside, pop some popcorn, find some Real Housewives to veg out to, whatever.
but we're gonna stick together, right?
sounds like a plan.
you're the best.
I'll join you guys later. I'm so sorry.
I have to do... an errand.
for my parents.
I mean, seriously?
okay, that was uncool. - What?
first of all, you're running around all paranoid, convinced that someone is after you.
now your best friend is grieving, and you say you got to, what, pick up some paper towels or something?
you don't understand. - No, I don't.
cause in my book, car wrecks, comas, almost dying sort of trump birth mother search.
this isn't just about that!
then tell me what it is about.
because that way, I can go in there and try and cover for you.
I can't do this now.
you must love doing everything alone.
no. No, I hate it.
still don't see why we couldn't have worked this out in your bedroom last night.
much nicer venue.
so what's your plan? Get me sent back to foster care in Vegas?
look, I don't give a crap about your Nancy Drew mystery.
I just want a little piece of the action.
you find a time the Mercers aren't home, leave a door unlocked...
no, Travis. I can't. They have been like family to me.
and I'm sure you've been just like family to them in return.
you know, honest and up front.
chillax, sis. We're not gonna clean them out.
just lift a few things.
we do it right, they don't even notice.
like this, for instance.
wait for my call.
knew I could count on you.
after all, we're family.
Yeah, I liked the guy.
but when I saw him in bed with my daughter, I liked him a hell of a lot less.
again, nothing happened.
nothing happened. " I just... I just find that so hard to believe.
weren't ready.
he wants to wait. He said that I was worth waiting for.
well, he's right. You are.
still doesn't explain how you ended up in that situation,
I mean, on the floor of some deserted house.
he doesn't want to live like that, Dad. He needs help.
okay, sweetheart, I feel sorry for the guy, but the responsible thing to do is contact the authorities.
he'll get kicked out of Arroyo and the golf team. I mean, that's his dream.
Sutton, will you tell them what happened in that documentary you saw?
uh, yeah, it was really bad.
this girl ran away from this horrible family and ended up on the streets.
see? - It's one example.
you can't generalize about every foster family in the United States of America.
okay, so it's Justin's fault that he's all alone?
why should he have to keep paying for stuff that happened to his parents?
okay, I will make some calls.
we'll find him a place to stay so he that he can stay in Arroyo.
you're the best. - Yeah.
if you're think of getting rid of anything, I won't say no to pearls.
I just wanted to say thanks for having my back in there.
Yeah, sure. Justin seems great.
you have no idea.
I'm so glad you waited.
you actually bought that in there?
there was no waiting at the Squatter Inn. Let's just say, been there, done that.
are you sure you're not moving a little too fast?
to be honest, I was... kind of scared.
the first time was definitely more weird than great.
but he was just... so nice and so caring.
and that was beautiful.
this isn't just some random hookup.
we're in love.
I mean, who am I talking to? It's like with you and Ethan.
when you have something so great, why would you wait?
Hey, guys.
what say we go down to the country club and hit a few buckets?
I'm kind of busy.
no, I already have plans with Char and Sutton.
I'm really sorry about Eduardo.
I said I'm sorry about Eduardo.
Why? I'll probably never see him again. You got just what you wanted.
Maddie, I know I haven't always been a perfect parent.
I want a do-over. A fresh start.
can I ask you something? - Anything.
what do you know about Sutton's adoption?
only what Ted's told me.
that the past few months has been really rough on him and Kristin both.
so, you guys talk about it a lot?
I mostly listen. He's taking this pretty tough.
I just try to be there for him.
I felt so awful having to leave earlier.
so, anyway, are you sure this isn't valuable?
all costume pieces.
okay, I promise you I will pay you back every cent, even if it takes me a while.
come on, can't you at least give me a hint what this is about?
I told you.
charity work.
I love charity work.
and you're an awesome friend.
now, that I believe.
what's so funny?
an allergy pillow protector.
that may be a first.
how is that so hard to grasp?
I have seasonal allergies, and this is a breeding ground for dust mites and bacteria.
a pillow protector probably only costs...
I have no idea. I bet it's not a lot, though.
let's focus here.
the good news is, you're a minor.
they have to grant your initial hearing within 48 hours.
hearing? What?
I told you, I haven't done anything.
truancy, delinquency, petty theft, assault, identity theft, fraud, breaking and entering.
just jump in when this starts to ring a bell.
this is all a misunderstanding.
people are confusing me with my identical twin sister.
I'm gonna stop you there, okay?
and I am on your side here, honestly.
word to the wise though, suck it up and tell the truth, you get out fast.
you start spinning wacko stories about identical twins, and you can expect to be in here a while.
not bad, sis, not bad.
if I were you, I'd wait till Vegas to fence it.
pawn it around here and it might raise some questions.
you know, we hit up a couple of your friends' houses, we could score big-time.
no. This was a one-off, remember? That was our deal.
fair enough. I'll keep my end of the deal.
but I think we should seal it to make it official.
get off me.
just
Ethan, wait.
Hi. - Hi.
so, about yesterday - I was feeling really overwhelmed, and I'm sorry if I was rude.
you're a good friend; we've been through a lot.
wasn't fair.
and... here's where I was hoping you would say something back.
like... we make a good team?
let me help you?
I thought I said that yesterday.
I guess we're good.
it's not Buckingham Palace, but it'll keep you in school.
Are-are you kidding me?
this place is amazing.
I talked to Mario in the clubhouse, too.
he's gonna throw you a few shifts, shagging range balls. Give you a little extra spending money.
this is really nice of you, Dr. Mercer.
I don't know what to say.
I know you've been dealt a pretty tough hand, Justin, and I just want you to know that I appreciate that you've been a gentleman with my daughter.
of course.
should that change, though, I will have to kill you.
I'm kidding. But this room is off-limits to Laurel.
same goes for you in her bedroom. Are we clear on that?
you have my word.
I gotta hand it to you - I mean, you certainly travel light.
no - This is, uh...
that's okay. Hey...
I'm a surgeon - nobody touches my instruments.
all right, well, enjoy your new digs.
you really think this is a smart idea?
honey, come on! This is Sedona.
look at this place.
a weekend, no kids, no stress, just the two of us.
well, and 2, 000 deadly dull plastic surgery colleagues.
okay, first off: ouch.
second, look - I'll go to two seminars max.
the rest, it will be swimming, biking, spa treatments
this'll be good for us, to be a couple.
you're really not concerned about this at all?
of course I'm concerned, okay?
aren't we supposed to trust our kids?
okay, our ears are burning.
your mother and I are going away this weekend.
Oh, yeah! That plastic surgery conference.
just the sound of it. - Romantic getaway- yes.
so here we go, house rules: No parties, okay?
no boys, no booze, no Justin's place.
so, basically, no fun.
see? They get it.
Yeah. You can totally trust us.
I thought I could always trust you; it's just, you...
okay, Mom- Justin- the whole thing with that was a mistake.
I won't happen again, I promise.
we'll be good, right? - Definitely. You guys should go.
okay. See? We got permission.
I think we need this.
we are so going to blow the roof off this place.
Hello?
you lied to me.
all this time, you let me believe that I killed my daughter.
now, you know that's crazy.
Sutton told me Emma is alive.
Sutton is a schizophrenic.
you're a liar!
she has been diagnosed with adolescent onset schizophrenia, Annie.
she stopped taking her medication.
you had to meet her like that.
I'm really sorry She was such a lovely young girl.
all these lies.
she has a loving family now, Annie.
they'll care for her; - give her the help she needs.
leave this one alone.
let this story have a happy ending.
what about my happy ending?
you look pretty. - You think?
I'd like to do you right here.
as poetic as that sounds, it's a little unhygienic around food prep.
my bad.
trying to use adult glassware was clearly a mistake.
it's fine. I'll stick to the casual elegance of red plastic.
my God, you were cute!
like, kid model cute.
you say that like I've turned into some hideous beast.
Ah, you're okay - I mean, like, in a first wife sort of way.
okay, that's it, you're dead.
it's all fun until someone ends up in tears.
what is your obsession with family albums, anyway?
get off your butt and come help me.
Hey, I have years to catch up on.
you and Justin seem really great together.
yeah... he's pretty amazing.
Hey, are you okay?
seem kind of sad. Where's Ethan?
Hello! - Hey. How you doing?
good. How are you? - Good.
Hi! - Hello. How you doin'?
good. How are you doin'? - Good.
hey... are you all right?
Yeah.
I'm going to go out on a limb here - does this have anything to do with Ethan?
can someone please tell me what that guy has that's so special?
I mean, doesn't that intense brooding shtick get old?
we had a fight.
not a fight, but... a stupid argument at school.
Oh, but I thought you guys were, uh... broken up?
Yeah. But...
but you don't want to be broken up.
I don't know.
and you know how he feels, obviously.
no, I... I don't know.
of all times I really need to talk to somebody
not that I would ever talk to Sutton about this...
of course.
do you mind? It's... a little rude.
right. Sorry.
can I ask you something?
not that it's any of my business, but it does affect my situation
what is going on with you and Sutton?
here's the deal:
nothing. The thing with Sutton was a mistake.
it was a result of misread cues... regrettable...
Disastrous... the sooner forgotten the better.
at least those were the words she used to soften the blow for me.
sorry.
Yeah, so was I.
and then I got mad.
and, in fact, I told her she had to go find a new place to live...
which is probably why she's gone AWOL.
and Sutton is still into Ethan.
big-time. That's why I couldn't be around her.
even though she's totally kidding herself.
why do you say that?
are you seriously that naive?
you really don't see why?
the reason she's kidding herself is because that guy's so into you.
as for Sutton - who knows?
is that who you were texting?
Oh, no, that was Ethan. I was just telling him to get his sorry ass over to this party.
you two were made for each other.
let someone be happy, right?
didn't I tell you this would be great?
it has been nice.
and, you know, honestly, I haven't worried about things at home once.
see? Gotta be able to trust your kids.
every once in a while, it's okay to leave your problems behind.
it's me - Tom. Tom List?
Craniofacial.
hey... hey, buddy.
I haven't seen you guys since that insane weekend in Santa Barbara. Gotta be 20 years.
Annie, right?
that's my wife... Kristin.
senior moment. I'm the worst with names.
too many martinis.
especially after a few It's good to bump into you again, Ted. Kristin.
enjoy the rest of your weekend. - Yeah, you, too.
don't be mad at me.
I'm not mad.
you're so far away right now.
I thought that's how you wanted it.
No! No, not at all.
the truth is, there was something going on yesterday, and it was big and it was stressful, but I need to deal with it on my own, and I did, and it's...
it's done. It's over.
and I feel so much better.
so could we just move on?
secrets were always Sutton's thing.
I just thought you were different.
I am different.
I am.
I'm sorry that I pushed you away.
I wa... I want to tell you everything and... who knows how... much time we have until Sutton walks through that door and I have to give back these glass slippers.
I want us to be together.
now, while we still can.
so you've told me everything.
okay, guys, who's ready for some "Never Have I Ever"?
Sutton... are you in?
Yeah. Somebody should explain the rules to Justin.
uh, yeah, I'm sure I can piece it together.
just so you know - this is cranberry juice and club soda.
loud and stupid.
alcohol makes me Isn't that the whole point of the game?
you know, I don't feel comfortable with people drinking and driving.
then I will be the designated driver.
I have no interest in secrets, anyway.
Oh, my brother can give me a ride. - Would anybody like some more vino?
is this a good idea?
not if you've got something to hide.
honey. It didn't mean anything.
but Annie... I mean, isn't that odd?
it's a pretty common name.
I mean... it's not like it was Apple, or Blanket. Something.
Plus, you can't listen to that bozo; the guy was hammered.
just be glad he wasn't performing a bone graft on you.
I've never been to Santa Barbara.
neither have I.
you know, we should go sometime.
okay. Never have I ever shoplifted.
Derek. Shoplifting's a chick thing.
not when you're stealing a belt sander.
never have I ever... kissed a girl.
Nope. - All right.
you never told me! - It was at soccer camp. One time.
never have I ever... pictured the lunch lady buck naked.
hold on. Which one?
dude. The hot chick with the big ass, not the unibrow and the hairnet...
I guess either of them.
Thanks, dude. Now we all have.
Hey, listen.
I just wanted to thank you.
for... - Yeah. Sure. It's a fun party.
what? No. No, no, no.
for telling us about your whole birth mother search.
and if there's anything that I could do, to help, you know...
never have I ever... gone all the way with someone that I truly love.
never have I ever... kissed someone in the past 24 hours.
intriguing, but I'm sorry...
wish I had the chance.
whoa, hey... - What?
I'm going to head home.
you sure?
Yeah, I've got to work tomorrow.
why don't you stay and help me clean up?
I can drop Char and Derek off, and then swing by the club for Justin.
I'm gonna be going with him, too.
I don't know. Justin's house?
mom and Dad were very clear.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I just want to spend the night with the guy I love.
please be careful.
always. See you in the morning.
try and sober up, okay?
what are we doing?
what are we waiting for?
I think... we should... you know...
I think you've had too much to drink.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
don't patronize me.
I'm serious. Really.
it's you and me, babe.
did you just call me "babe"?
that was the wine talking, but... - That's interesting. All right.
I'm going to put you to bed. - No, I'm going to put you to bed, mister.
okay, that'll do. All right.
mm, my hero.
why don't you want me?
is it because I've had just a little, teensy, tiny bit too much to drink?
we'll talk about it tomorrow.
I don't want to talk about it tomorrow.
you're a really hard guy to be in a relationship with, you know that?
you're in, and then you're out, and then... who knows what you want?
come back.
back from the party?
looks that way.
you have fun? - Mads have fun?
I don't know, ask her.
sit down, sit down, Thayer.
listen, I know you got a lot of anger directed at me right now.
it's understandable. I've been a bit of a hardass, haven't I?
when it comes to your future, and... law school, a clerkship, a job at the D. A...
probably right across the hall from your office.
Yeah.
you had my whole future planned out for me, didn't you? - I guess I did.
and you don't see how messed up that is?
I do, and that's what I want to talk to you about, okay?
there's no way to say it... I messed up.
Yeah, okay.
Thayer, you know, the-these last few months, of you being in L. A. and us not talking...
that's, that's not good.
we used to do stuff together, you and me.
we'd go to the batting cages, or we'd go to the driving range.
Yeah, well, we haven't done that stuff in years.
that doesn't mean I don't miss it like hell.
son, I'm not going to interfere in your life.
I'm going to stay out of it. But I got a little advice for you.
don't let anyone else stand in your way, either.
Meaning? - Sutton.
I know how you feel about her.
okay.
what is this?
it's just a little something.
that's for your gaming.
should be enough to get a presentation together.
then down the line, maybe I can introduce you to some V.C. guys.
and rustle up some real money.
dad, why are you doing this?
I miss you. I don't care about a future lawyer.
I want my son back.
well, aren't I going to get the house tour?
we can start in the great rooms and then work our way through.
it's perfect.
all thanks to your dad.
all thanks to my persuasion.
Yeah, that too.
okay, I'm not going to dock you any style points since you just moved in, but pretty soon we will have to go house shopping.
that's cool.
what's that?
I'm guessing baseball cards or comic books and hoping it isn't porn.
Hey, Oh... Let's give it some time.
I just moved in.
okay. I won't touch a thing.
now... I never said that.
I like the way you think. - Yeah?
what are you thinking now?
Hello, you've reached the Mercers. Please leave a message.
sure you don't want to leave a message?
at least someone will know you're here.
no, I don't want to waste my call.
I'll just try again later.
Hey, sis. - What are you doing here?
a red flag went up when you told me to wait till I got home to fence this.
funny, the pawn shop here in Phoenix says this is all fake costume junk.
any idea why that might be?
I have no idea.
I'll get you some real stuff now.
get you a ring, this... Oh!
I think you're gonna give me more than that.
you look hot, Emma. - Oh, God.
who knew the combination of white trash and social poser could be such a turn-on?
EW, Travis, you're disgusting.
what are you doing?
I'm-I'm sorry, um...
it's just, you seemed so secretive about it and I wanted...
you wanted to know what was in it.
don't you remember what curiosity did to the cat?
it got her a pretty awesome present.
it was my mom's.
I've been waiting for a special occasion, but I guess this is as special as any.
I'm never taking this off.
why didn't you tell me you saw this creep kiss me?
figured it was up to you to tell me.
I didn't know why you were upset.
you were tormenting me by not saying anything.
and you know what? I'm so over this "man of few words" act.
well, why wouldn't you tell me that this guy was here extorting you?
because if anything bad happened, I didn't want you to get in trouble.
it's not like it would have been your first strike.
and that's the entire reason?
well, yeah! What else would there be?
what are you not telling me?
I was embarrassed, okay?
I was ashamed about what I come from.
you do realize I live in a trailer.
I'm surrounded by rusty motorcycles and spare car parts.
but all you've seen me as is this princess wearing Sutton's gorgeous clothes, and driving her swanky car.
and it was this fantasy, and I didn't want it to end.
but I knew that if you saw this
saw who I really was
it'd just be over.
that may be the dumbest thing you've ever said.
Plus, I was afraid you might kill him.
and I wasn't very far off. I mean, look at us.
all of a sudden, we're in a Coen Brothers movie.
he's fine.
I mean, the guy deserves a lot worse than what he got.
I knew there was someone in the house when I got up to get the phone.
the phone?
who was calling in the middle of the night?
Las Vegas Juvenile Detention Center.
you don't think... - Oh, my God... Sutton?
Hey, I'm home.
Sutton? Rise and shine.
Hello?
Laurel, thank God. It's Sutton.
Hey, Sutton, are you... at Ethan's?
no, why would you think that?
well, you were pretty buzzed last night and basically throwing yourself at him by the end of the night, so...
Hello? Girls?
hold on. Empty sighting.
Hello!
dude, you gotta come home right now. Mom and Dad just got back.
wait, no! I need help. I'm stuck in Ju...
come on!
sorry, you know the rules. One phone call.
I... No, I-I need to get a message to somebody. You don't understand.
letter's always nice.
Hello, darling.
you guys are back early.
we wanted to catch you in the act of throwing that big blowout party.
Yes, well, as you can see, it's all cleaned up.
that's a nice bracelet. I haven't seen that before.
Yeah. Where'd you get that?
a little vintage shop downtown.
you always have such a good eye for jewelry.
Yeah, no kidding. - Where's Sutton?
probably having breakfast at the club. She's such a princess.
Hey, Mom and Dad... you should know that the girl living in my room right now and calling herself "Sutton" isn't me.
she's stolen my identity, my family and friends, and I'm now afraid of how far she'll go to keep me from taking my life back.
what are you looking at?
didn't we have an old photograph of Annie Sewell in here?
this isn't because of what that drunk said at the conference, is it?
I don't know. I just can't seem to get her out of my head for some reason.
I could swear we had an old photograph.
you know, I haven't looked at that thing in years.
Hey, one of the pages has been torn out.
could've been one of the kids when they were younger.
what happened to her?
Annie Sewell. - Who knows?
I think she pretty much fell off the grid.
time for your meds.
ms. Hobbs?
doctor?
you think I won't go straight to the cops, tell them all about Emma's sister scam?
go ahead.
something tells me they're gonna be more interested in you.
breaking and entering, extortion, sexual assault.
that's ten to 20, easy.
what are you, a legal expert?
no, I'm an eyewitness, douche.
okay, so it was definitely Sutton who called your house.
apparently, she was sent from some psych clinic in L. A.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, well, here's the good news, is they dropped Emma's assault charges on this idiot.
so, Sutton's being released.
okay, well, why isn't she answering the phone?
I've called her and texted her.
probably took her phone.
who would post bail for Emma Becker?
they wouldn't give me any more information. Sorry.
you got both these dudes whipped.
must be making it worth their while, huh?
you want to take a trip to the hospital, huh?
Hey, hey, relax, relax!
all right. Okay. Come on.
here's the deal.
you're gonna get in this crapbox and you're gonna go to whatever hole you crawled out of.
no stops, no detours.
Oh, and do obey the speed limits.
if I ever catch you in Phoenix again...
a prison sentence will be the least of your worries.
we do hope you've enjoyed your stay.
come back and visit anytime.
so, you're seriously not gonna tell me who signed to let me out?
told you, it says anonymous.
doesn't happen every day.
you must have friends in high places.
yo! Emma!
get over here!
hi... - Thought everybody got one call from Juvie.
or is that just, like, urban legend?
uh, no, that's true, actually.
and you don't use yours to call your best friend?
Bi-atch, you got some splaining to do. Get in the car.
sorry. Do you remember my, uh, cousin Norman?
the like, thick-necked- do you want a chip?
Bull-neck, ex-Marine homophobic guy who has like all the Patti LuPone CDs?
I mean, dude, like, don't ask, don't tell, just don't kid yourself.
right... No...
he works Juvie security, and he found out that you were getting sprung.
so, lucky for you, I was able to go home, and, uh, jumpstart the ol' Pequod.
Thanks, Lexi, for not leaving me on the side of the road in the desert and having to walk home.
right, thank you.
it's cool.
dude, what happened to "I'm gonna call you every three days," huh?
did you hear from You-Know-Who?
do you know what your next move is gonna be?
it's cool. You can just tell me everything while we drive.
Laurel? - Nothing happened.
nothing happened. I just find that so hard to believe.
he said that I was worth waiting for. You actually bought that in there?
there was no waiting at the Squatter Inn. Let's just say been there, done that.
social Services said I'm supposed to call the cops.
that's just what I think I'm gonna do.
what are we waiting for?
I think we should... you know.
I think you've had too much to drink.
all right, I'm gonna put you to bed.
no, I'm gonna put you to bed.
Hey, Mom and Dad, you should know that the girl living in my room right now and calling herself Sutton isn't me.
thought everybody got one call from juvie and you don't use yours to call your best friend.
you can just tell me everything while we drive.
so, Emma, aside from the fact that you disappeared and scared the crap out of me, how was Phoenix? I got to know.
Phoenix... was fine.
you sound like you're describing a trip to Applebee's.
dude, you found your long-lost twin.
this is huge. Like, what was she like?
is she cool or is she snobby?
actually, she's... - Oh, what about your birth mom?
did you ever find her?
I really just told you everything, didn't I?
Lexi, you ever notice what a big stupid mouth I have?
frequently.
Oh, and speaking of big stupid mouths, Clarice knows you're here.
the police must have called her once you were booked.
that evil foster mother.
Hey, you don't think she's the one that signed for my release, do you?
extremely doubtful.
she was kind of hoping you would rot in there.
so how long you in Vegas for?
I - I'm not really sure. I need to get back to California.
that's where... Sutton found our mom.
unfortunately, I don't have any cash or clothes or a place to stay, so...
are you kidding? You're gonna crash with me.
Really?
Yeah. Where else would you stay?
come on, it'll be like old times.
I-I don't know what to say, but thank you.
no need for thank yous.
just admit that Lexi Samuels is the best best friend ever.
got a minute?
it's okay.
God, you scared me. - Just me.
sorry. I'm just a little jumpy from everything that happened last night.
speaking of last night... So I'm sorry for...
okay, how do I say this?
drunkenly propositioning you.
it's okay.
but just for clarification, are you apologizing for coming on to me or the fact that you were drunk when you did it?
come on, no girl wants to be a drooling idiot when it's her first time.
your first time?
awkward moment.
I'm hungry. Do you want something?
pretzels? Yogurt? Yogurt... pretzels?
wait a second.
I'm just saying we don't have to talk about this right now.
it's what we've been telling Sutton her whole life.
Yes, and I've never been comfortable with it.
I know it shouldn't make a difference, but Sutton has been so wonderful lately.
we've grown closer than ever.
Exactly! So why would you want to jeopardize that?
I think it's time to tell her.
we don't actually know that her birth mother is dead.
you've seen how she's been lately, asking all these questions about her past.
and if we have the answers to some of those questions, don't you think we should tell her?
I just think it's too risky.
I guess I just don't know anymore.
Hello, Ted.
Alec, yeah. Look, I think I may have a situation.
Yeah, you and me both.
it's Kristin. I think she's gonna tell Sutton about her birth mother.
that wouldn't be good, would it? And I don't get it.
we've kept this united front for 17 years almost.
Ted, Kristin is a very... honest person.
I know, that's why, that's why I love her.
Yeah, me, too. But you need to get your wife under control, man.
we both know why Sutton can never find out who her birth mother is.
Yes. The question is why?
is it really worth the trouble to cover up some shady adoption?
why don't you talk to Kristin about it?
I mean, she sounded like she wanted to talk.
that's what I'm going to do.
and not just her, I'm gonna ask Alec.
Seriously? - Yeah.
as pissed as Sutton is now, when she gets back here, the only way that she's gonna let me stay is if I have some answers for her.
you clearly disagree with me. What?
Emma, look, I'm trying to be supportive here.
I just want to make sure that this is what you want.
Ethan, I have never been more sure about anything.
welcome home.
nice.
what are you doing?
Oh, you know me. Just capturing the moment.
and do you really think this moment is worth capturing?
ems, no moment is too small.
so, as you can see, we remodeled the place.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
come on, your place is nice. Thanks.
well, it's a lot nicer than Clarice's house.
but I bet your place in Phoenix was pretty sweet.
Ooh, and your mom's place in California - what was that like?
is she loaded?
actually, the place she's staying sucks.
kind of why I have to get back there.
is this your way of bumming another ride? 'Cause we have school in the morning.
school? No. I- I have to... - Emma!
I heard you were back.
I heard you got in trouble, too.
What'd you do, go on another crime spree whacking people with your tennis racket?
no, that was a misunderstanding.
Hey, it's-it's good to see you again.
dang, Moneybags, you hit the jackpot?
couple of Dallas high rollers on a $100 table.
Oh, yeah. Big tippers.
are you hungry, Emma? You want some mac and cheese?
that would be fantastic. Thank you.
milk and butter's in the fridge. Knock yourself out.
I'm gonna take a bath.
well, someone looks snazzy in a suit.
it's a big dinner.
my dad is hooking me up with this venture capitalist guy who might want to invest in my company.
wow, how supportive of him.
he's not here, is he? I just have a question for him.
Seriously? Don't tell me you found something new to be suspicious about.
Oh, no, it's just, it's a legal question for school.
Hey, you haven't heard from Sutton, have you?
no, not a word. I mean, I thought she'd be back in L. A. but I called my landlady, and she says she hasn't seen her in days.
you don't think anything bad happened?
I'll put it to you this way.
I would be a lot more worried if I didn't know how long that girl can hold a grudge.
Sutton. What a pleasant surprise.
t, where's your sister?
our reservation's in ten minutes.
Yeah, I just texted her; she's on her way.
Oh, and I think Sutton has some legal questions for you.
Really? - Yeah.
Oh, no, it can wait. You guys have dinner. I don't want to interrupt.
no, there's plenty of room.
why don't you join us and then you can ask me all the questions you want.
okay.
I got to take this. Would you excuse me?
Yeah. See you in the lounge.
Dr. Hughes, this isn't really a good time.
is this something we can discuss later?
I'm afraid not.
it's Annie Hobbs. She's escaped.
bus fare to Phoenix, 80 bucks?
why don't you just hit up your fancy twin for the cash?
Yeah, that's not going to happen. - Why?
Lexi, Sutton and I are not exactly besties right now.
kind of figured she might turn out to be an entitled little bitch.
but, anyways, here's the clothes that you left at my house the night we snuck into the Fleet Foxes show.
and, uh, other various borrowed items.
I don't think this fits me anymore.
gained weight.
I'm just kidding. Sorry.
if you don't like any of these, you can just raid my closet, or my mom's. She doesn't care.
just don't forget to put everything back.
and you are never going to guess who's here to see you.
sweetheart.
let me get a look at you.
you had me so worried.
I did?
I know there's been some bad blood between us, but, honey...
I want to fix that.
Hey, would you two mind giving us a minute to catch up?
Yeah, kinda. - Lexi.
evidence.
ems, holler if you need me.
so, Clarice... how you doing?
Oh, shut up, you ungrateful little bitch.
do you have any idea what kind of trouble you put me through?
I guess not.
after you left, they took away my license to be a foster parent.
now I got to wait 18 months before they'll even think of placing a child in my care.
do you know what that means, Emma?
what, that you're a disgruntled empty-nester?
it means the checks stopped coming. You owe me.
first of all...
...get out of my face, Clarice.
you smell like an airport bathroom. Second, I owe you nothing!
you are a terrible person, you're not my mother, and if you ever - do you hear me?
ever put your hands on me again, you will be asking for a world of hurt. Got it?
and the best thing is these apps work on multiple platforms
facebook, Twitter, next month, Google Plus.
that way we can establish the widest user base possible.
Yeah, absolute... well, I got to say, Thayer, I'm impressed.
your dad told me how talented you were, and you proved it.
I think the next step is to take you to the office, meet my boss.
I tell you, Thayer's a genius.
he's even got me playing these games, and you know how I hate this stuff.
thay actually is kind of genius.
that's right, Derek and Char are celebrating.
ten-day anniversary- it's kind of a big deal for her.
char and who?
Derek. - You remember Derek.
didn't you help him out with some community service or something?
Derek... Derek, right, nice kid.
he had some brushes with the law, need a push in the right direction.
you had a question for me earlier.
what was it, something legal?
well, I'm writing a paper on perjury and, well, I was wondering, as a lawyer, how can you tell if someone is hiding something?
that's an excellent question, Sutton.
you know, it's not really an exact science, but, generally when someone's not being 100% honest, there's a lack of eye contact, a rise in vocal pitch, uh, fidgety behavior.
so would you say, like, drumming your fingers on the couch, like that kind of behavior?
well... like I said, it's not an exact science, you know.
Yeah, will you guys excuse me for a second? I think I left my wallet in my locker.
babe, I got to hit the bathroom. Be right back.
okay.
Hey, Alec, what's up?
you tell me. You're the one sitting down with Char, hanging out.
you getting information? What do you got for me?
nothing right now.
it's actually more of a personal dinner.
Oh, personal?
getting to know each other a little bit?
that's cute. How are her grades?
no, what's her favorite song?
you really want to know that stuff?
no, because it's useless, just like you.
the idea was for you to get her to fall in love with you, not the other way around.
you're getting soft, man, you're becoming a liability to me.
now, you go in there right now and break up with her.
you're kidding.
do I look like I'm kidding?
come on, Alec, I've been loyal to you. I've done everything you've asked.
which is why you're gonna go in there right now and finish it.
Sutton, where are you going?
I was just gonna get some air.
why don't you join me back at the table?
Laurel, honey, could I talk to you a second?
can we do it later? I'm sort of in a hurry here.
actually, it's kind of important.
important like I forgot to take out the trash last night important, or important like someone's dying?
I found it in the wash.
it must have fallen out of your pocket.
I thought you said you and Justin were waiting.
Yeah, um, and then I guess we kind of stopped.
look, I'm not mad. It's just, there are a lot of issues to be considered here.
you're 16 years old; this is a really big step.
mom, Justin and I love each other.
sweetheart, you may think you love him.
you, you barely know him.
Oh, right,'cause I'm just a kid.
how could I possibly know who I'm in love with?
you're getting upset. I just want to be able to talk honestly about this.
no, you want to tell me what to do, and that's why I can't talk about this.
perfect.
there's my girl. How was your first day?
not great.
just spent the morning in the attendance office learning about the perils of truancy.
well, I mean, you did kind of fall off the face of the earth.
here. - What is this?
it's, it's lunch - brown bag full of food.
I believe you're familiar with the concept.
Hey, can we just pause for a moment and talk about this little outfit you're rocking today?
well, you know, your mom said I could borrow some stuff from her closet.
Yeah, but you, like, totally
- Whatever.
what happened to the old Emma?
you know,"keep a low profile until we graduate and get the hell out of here"?
Oh, well, I mean, that's still the plan, but might as well look good while we're doing it, right?
Hey, guys.
Hi. - Emma, right?
Yes. Kelvin McConnell. You might remember me.
I'm pretty sure you're the girl who keyed the word "ass-hat" into my locker last year.
no, that doesn't sound like me.
it was you.
anyway, that's all in the past, and to prove it...
I'm having a little casino party tonight at my dad's hotel.
just a few friends,$100 buy-in, but you don't have to gamble if you don't want to.
I would love for you to come.
Oh, and your friend, too.
Thanks. - We'll think about it.
cool, hope to see you tonight.
we'll think about it?
Yeah, why wouldn't we?
I don't know, maybe because parties like that are cesspools full of skanks, jocks, and bro-dudes with double-digit IQs.
what about his friend, the guy in the jacket?
don't tell me you weren't just totally eye-humping him.
okay, he's pretty to look at, but it doesn't mean I want to go party with him.
they just sat down, let's go.
nice try, but we sit over here.
den mothers of the disenfranchised is a really tough job, but someone's got to do it.
Swaggin' Wagon, what's up?
Hello, my sexy, wonderful boyfriend of 11 days.
Hey, is everything okay?
not really.
char, there's something I got to talk to you about.
boy, this is tough.
I've had a lot of fun these last few days.
no. Derek, you're not going to do this, you can't.
I'm Char Chamberlin, rember?
I don't know what happened.
he just broke up with me out of the blue, and I have no idea why.
char, I'm so sorry.
why would he do this? Everything was so great.
it's guys, isn't it? They're so selfish and unpredictable.
char, I-I think it might be more complicated than that.
what do you mean? Did Derek say something?
no, no, I just...
I saw him last night at the club talking to Alec.
seriously, Sutton? Not this Alec thing again.
if Derek was talking to him, it was about his probation or whatever.
look, I don't know what was said, I couldn't hear it, but I know that Derek looked really upset.
why would Alec care who Derek's dating?
I don't know, but when you consider the timing of it and what happened with Eduardo,
I'm just saying Alec could be capable of a lot more than we think.
Hey, hon.
Hey. - What's that?
one of Sutton's birthday presents.
big day's around the corner.
I know. Can you believe it - 17?
sweetie, I just want to apologize for yesterday.
you know I always want to be honest with Sutton.
we'll have to talk about that later, but for now we may want to try being honest with ourselves.
right.
what are we talking about?
laurel and Justin are sleeping together.
they... they told us that they were waiting.
Yeah, well, they lied, and we were so quick to believe them because that is what we wanted to believe.
so, what, are we idiots? - No, we're parents.
I've already spoken to Laurel, or tried to.
you have to speak to Justin.
I got to be honest, that may be a little difficult without me beating him to death with my putter.
besides, why does it have to be me?
well, we took him under our wing, and whether we like it or not, we're the closest thing to parents he's got.
mom, can I talk to you?
Yeah, what's going on?
I was kind of hoping I could have a moment alone.
Yeah.
Hi, hon. - Hi, Dad.
what's going on?
so... okay, I d... I don't, I don't really know how to say this.
I... I overheard you and Dad arguing yesterday.
well, I mean, if you're going to live in this house, that sometimes happens.
Yeah, but this was different.
you guys were arguing over whether or not you should tell me the truth about something, and I want to know what it is.
I just... It just doesn't ring a bell.
maybe you misheard something or you just caught part of a conversation and...
and misunderstood. - Yeah, that must be it.
I have to take this upstairs.
are we seriously going to do this all day?
study? Yes.
I've got a French test on Friday, and, unlike you,
I haven't blown off an entire semester, putting my collegiate future in jeopardy.
wait a minute. Hold on.
you said the test is on Friday?
okay, so that's four days away. Why are you studying for that now?
because we can't all have a natural knack for languages, Em.
Oh, come on, I'm not that good.
Oh, please. You're, like, a conjugation wizard.
Oh, come on, just help me out here.
you know what would be so fun?
Oh, that stupid casino party.
no. Put that away. We make fun of people who go to stuff like that.
no. So?
we can make fun of them to their faces while we're taking their money.
money which, may I remind you, I so desperately need.
may I remind you that the buy-in for that is the same price as a bus ticket?
you're broke. Kind of don't see how it's possible.
Yes, but there's money in the cookie jar, right?
not your money.
we'll put it back in after we win.
come on, it'll be an adventure.
an adventure in getting my ass kicked.
hot guy in the jacket's gonna be there.
Darn. - Come on, I'll be your best friend.
Oh, it's kind of late for that.
don't give me the look. - Please.
okay, fine, fine, we can go.
and you know that little, uh, number you did on your ensemble earlier?
can you work some of that magic on me?
definitely.
Hello? - Charlotte Chamberlin?
Yeah. - We've never actually met.
my name's Annie. I'm your aunt.
aunt Annie. What a surprise.
it's nice to meet you, I guess?
I suppose you're calling for my mom.
no, actually, I wanted to speak to you.
Annie, hello. Are you there?
damn it, Annie, answer me!
what was that?
you're never to talk to that woman again. Do you understand?
no, I don't.
what happened between the two of you? And why won't you talk about it?
Oh, your aunt made a series of poor decisions, got mixed up with the wrong people.
and they destroyed her.
so, why don't you do something about it?
I mean, you're her sister.
trust me, honey, I've spent years trying, but the person you just spoke with stopped being my sister long ago.
I asked Kristin flat out,"What were you and Dad arguing about?
and what did she say? - Nothing.
I mean, maybe she wanted to tell me the truth, but the fact is, she didn't, and...
I don't know. Sutton's right. Kristin's lying.
I mean, they all are.
okay. Well, don't you think now is where you should walk away from this?
let Sutton deal with this when she gets back.
what, and give up?
there's got to be another way.
this is my only shot before I get shipped back on bus to Vegas or wherever, and, you know, I just have to keep going, and why are you looking at me like that?
it's nothing. It's just your optimism - it's kind of relentless.
you find that amusing?
no. I find it amazing.
you're a little quiet, sir. Everything okay?
not entirely.
anything I can help with?
Justin, when you came into my daughter's life, into my family's life,
I thought we had an agreement.
to always respect your daughter.
I take it very seriously.
but... I think I see what you're driving at.
you know that Laurel and I... - Yeah.
I'm sure that was a hard thing to hear.
I mean, obviously, I'm-I'm not a father.
yet. That's why I wanted to talk to you, Justin. You weren't honest with me.
I know. I'm sorry. I should have known better.
I - I know what lies can do to people, how it can tear a family apart.
I guess that's why you're my role model, sir.
because I know you never lie. Right?
Sutton, you got a second?
Yeah. What's going on?
you will not believe what happened this morning.
at this point, I'm pretty sure I'd believe anything.
mom found a condom in the wash.
I must have left it in my pocket when I stayed the night at Justin's.
what did you tell her?
well, there wasn't really much I could say.
although I did briefly consider telling her it was yours.
of course. More lies.
isn't that how everyone handles things around here?
geez, what's your problem? I'm the one in trouble here.
well, maybe if you would have told Mom and Dad what was going on, you wouldn't have this issue.
okay, hold on. You're going to lecture me on telling the truth?
Laurel, the only way this family is ever going to work is if people start being honest with each other.
people are staring at us.
of course they are. We're hot.
cash, please?
why am I already regretting this?
Emma, Lexi, you guys look amazing.
thank you.
as opposed to how we normally look?
Lexi, chill.
can I get you guys a drink? Beer, wine, mocktail?
no, I'm fine. Thank you.
I believe my seat just opened up.
just jumping right in, huh?
guess I'm feeling lucky tonight.
guess I'm feeling lucky tonight.
Hi. - Hi.
I was just grabbing some yogurt.
Laurel, honey, can I just...? - Mom, can I just...?
let me just say this. I'm sorry.
not for sleeping with Justin, because I still feel like that was my choice to make.
but I am really sorry for lying to you and Dad.
there's never a good reason for that.
I hope you know you can always talk to us... about anything.
I know. It's just, with this particular... subject, I...
I guess I was worried about what you would think of me.
honey, you're my daughter. I love you.
even though I'd be lying if I said I was comfortable with your decision not to wait,
I think the important thing is just that we're honest with each other.
I thought you knew how to play blackjack.
dude, we're down to our last 30 bucks.
calm down. I just hit a little cold streak. That's it.
hit me.
Emma, how could you possibly hit that?
I had 15.
Yeah, and the dealer has a six. You're supposed to let him bust.
see? Clarice not teach you anything?
what are you doing?
just memorializing your stupidity, that's all.
Randy, let me take over for a few hands, all right?
still feeling lucky?
not really.
well, let's see if we can't turn that around.
and I busted. You win.
you win again.
another winner.
we're up 50 bucks.
we should just quit while we're ahead.
are you kidding? It's not even enough for my bus ticket.
well, we can figure that out later. Let's go.
no, I... Just one more hand.
that's it. I swear.
okay, but one more, and I mean it.
Oh, my God.
wow, that's kind of a big bet. I mean, for anybody. Are you sure?
he's right. Are you crazy?!
I went all in. People do it all the time.
Yeah. Broke people.
okay, hit me.
that's 17. - Yes.
give me another card.
Really?
no, Emma. What are you doing?
nobody hits a hard 17. Ever.
well, then, look at me breaking the rules.
card, please.
I'm gonna throw up.
I'm good. - Yes, you are.
here we go.
done. - We win!
Oh, my God, we win, we win.
you're an idiot, but we win!
Congratulations.
thank you. Kelvin, can I just talk to you over here for a minute?
sure.
okay.
you let me win, didn't you?
that last card wasn't supposed to be a jack.
wait, are you saying that I rigged my own game just to impress you?
give you your money back?
that's quite an accusation.
okay, well, then, let's head on back to the table, because I'm clearly on an incredible hot streak.
okay, I'm not saying I rigged it.
I'm just saying, you might want to quit while you're ahead.
okay. Thanks, I guess.
no problem.
so can I get you that drink?
Thanks, but I'm gonna go find Lexi. She's my ride.
well, remember. If you don't find her, you can always crash here with me.
Kelvin, I think you better quit while you're ahead.
you were right.
there is something you don't know, something we should have told you years ago.
okay. I tried telling myself I did it to protect you.
the truth is, I was afraid of losing you.
mom...
whatever it is, I promise that won't ever happen.
Sutton, your birth mother may still be alive.
and I'm so sorry we lied.
no, you don't have to explain. I just want to know everything you know.
well, I don't have any details, just, she was a very troubled woman.
Yeah. Yeah, I know that. You've told me that.
what was her name?
but you know her name. It's on the birth certificate.
and that's the truth?
Yes. I can't tell you what a relief it is to finally be able to share this with you.
and I promise you, if it's important to you,
I will do everything I can to help you find her.
so Kristin has no idea that Annie Hobbs is a part of this?
as far as Kristin knows, Annie was Phyllis's weirdo sister.
she has no idea that Sutton has a twin, and- my favorite part- no idea Ted's lying to her.
and she has felt guilty for all these years for hiding this story from Sutton, and the whole time, the story has been a lie.
so maybe it's time you tell Kristin what you know.
I can't. She's way too fragile. It would destroy her.
Ethan, I would hate it if the last thing I did with this family was tear them apart.
well, what about you?
what about me?
what about what you want? These people are lying to you.
they lied to Sutton. They're lying to each other.
then they sit around at their ballet recitals, sipping their eight-dollar latte with a smile on their face like there's nothing wrong.
why do you keep protecting them?
because they're my family, Ethan.
well, at least the closest thing I've... got.
Emma. - What?
stop worrying about other people, start worrying about you.
okay, so the weirdest thing happened yesterday.
remember my mom's sister, the one we're not supposed to talk about?
Yeah. Annie, right?
Yeah. Well, she called my house.
you're kidding. You actually talked to her?
barely.
my mom grabbed the phone from me so fast, I thought she was gonna rip my arm off.
I talked to Sutton last night.
I see. What exactly did you say?
I told her her birth mother may still be alive, that we have a name, but other than that, we don't know much.
so you told her everything.
how exactly did she take it?
she's fine.
Ted, I know this isn't what you wanted, but I just don't want secrets in our family.
of course.
I also promised Sutton I'd help her find her birth mother.
honey... if it's that important to you,
I'm not gonna stand in your way.
what did I say about coming to my place of work?
I know, and I'm sorry, but I had to talk to you.
I've got new info, something big. It's about Annie.
fine, what is it?
okay, so this is the part you're not going to like.
but if you want me to tell you what I know, you've got to let me get back together with Char.
you're kidding me. - No, sir, I'm not.
are you trying to blackmail me, Derek? 'Cause...
please don't think it's because I don't respect you, because I do.
it's just... Char's very important to me.
what if I decided to reinstate those possession charges?
then I'd rather go to jail.
go to jail, right.
do we have a deal or not?
Hello?
Hey, Emma, it's Troy. From the Dowinger Clinic.
I snaked your number from Dr. Hughes' office.
why are you calling me?
well, I kind of thought you'd want to know, your biological mom escaped.
what? When?
couple nights ago.
and you have no idea where she is or where she was going?
I'd say it's a safe bet she's coming to look for you.
okay, thanks.
well, this has turned out to be a very interesting day.
what's going on?
three guys have asked me out from that party last night and it's not even lunch yet.
that's great.
Yeah, I mean, it's flattering, but I kind of like Randy the best.
Randy... - Hot jacket guy.
he told me about a really great party next weekend, so we should go.
that sounds so fun.
but I just found out something about my mom, and I have to leave.
right. To California?
actually, Phoenix.
I bet it'll be nice to be back to your old life, see all your fancy friends, sleep in your own bed.
that will be nice.
not that it's my life.
obviously. What?
come on. Did you really think you were pulling this off, Sutton?
Sutton, did you write us a letter?
no, why?
well, it looks like your handwriting. It's addressed to your dad and me.
mom, stop!
what?
I forgot. I - I did write this... letter when I was upset, when I knew you and Dad weren't telling me the truth about, um, you know.
so I'm guessing the letter says things you're no longer feeling?
no. It's stuff I didn't mean.
why don't you tear it up?
okay, I'm gonna go.
wait, Justin. It's still early.
do you want to come inside and watch a movie or something?
Yeah, that might not be such a great idea.
I just think, you know, considering the recent events, - maybe we should... - No, babe, it's okay.
I had a great talk with my mom.
we have this whole, you know, new honesty policy thing, and, um, I think it's gonna work out great.
actually, it's not your mom that I'm worried about.
then who? My dad?
sweet, goofy Dr. Ted Mercer, the man who actually teared up watching that Justin Bieber documentary?
I wasn't even gonna say anything, and maybe I'm wrong.
but I just... Laurel...
I'm starting to think that your dad is not as great a guy as everyone thinks.
so, you never thought I was Emma, not even for, like, a second?
no. - How did you figure it out?
when did you figure it out?
honestly, the second that you got into my car.
dude, come on. Emma's my best friend.
so you think you guys are gonna patch things up when you get back to Phoenix?
maybe. I mean, the girl did steal my boyfriend.
that doesn't sound like the Emma I know.
all she could talk about before she left was how excited she was to meet you.
Yeah, well, it doesn't really excuse what she's done.
although, after pretending to be her for these last couple of days,
I'm starting to regret sending this letter.
it could really get her in trouble.
well, maybe you should go back there and make things right.
maybe.
anyway, thank you, Lexi, for everything.
right back at you.
one for the road? - Sure.
well, if you're ever back in Vegas... - Definitely.
Bye. - See ya.
Hey, Mom and Dad,"you should know that the girl living in my room right now"and calling herself Sutton isn't me.
she's stolen my identity,"my family and friends, "and I'm now afraid of how far she'll go to keep me from taking my life back.
and it just gets worse.
at least you intercepted the letter.
are you kidding?
Ethan, I have to leave Phoenix as soon as possible.
how could I be so stupid to think that... everything would work out here?
you know what sucks?
is I have to say good-bye to everybody.
and this place.
you.
maybe not me.
what do you mean?
I mean, wherever you go, Emma, I'm coming with you.
I gotta know.
Oh, what about your birth mom?
I really just told you everything, didn't I?
these people are lying to you.
they lied to Sutton. They're lying to each other.
I thought you said you and Justin were waiting.
then I guess we kind of stopped.
I'm sorry. I should've known better.
I know how lies can tear a family apart.
as a lawyer, how can you tell if someone is hiding something?
that's an excellent question, Sutton.
you're getting soft, man.
you go in there, right now, and break up with her.
I just have to leave.
did you really think you were pulling this off, Sutton?
you've gotta let me get back together with Char.
what if I decided to reinstate those possession charges?
I'm starting to regret sending this letter.
it could really get her in trouble.
then maybe you should go back there and make things right.
maybe.
how could I think that everything would work out here?
Ethan, I have to leave Phoenix as soon as possible.
wherever you go, Emma, I'm coming with you.
excuse me, sir. How much longer till Phoenix?
won't be too much longer, if you get back in your seat.
wake up, sleepyhead.
happy birthday, honey.
per tradition, breakfast in bed.
waffles, butter, syrup.
I know you hate it, but there's no escaping.
this is great. I don't even know what to say.
you can start with your birthday wish.
but if I say it out loud, it won't come true.
duh! That's why we always do the bogus wish.
like last year, what I wished for - anybody remember? Anybody?
that you never get a boyfriend.
that's right. - And now I have one.
okay.
I wish I could run away and never come back.
okay... - Excellent. Excellent.
let's leave the birthday girl to herself. We've got lots to do before the party.
this is a pre-birthday gift. Sneaky suspicion you are going to love it.
guys, wait...
this was really great.
thank you.
Hey, just the beginning.
Hi.
Hi.
happy birthday.
that means everything.
okay, we both know how Sutton could be back here any second now.
I'm pretty much ready to go.
are you?
I can't.
I thought I could, but I love these people, Ethan.
I'm going to tell them the truth.
so I thought about it all night, and then again this morning and, however they react - whether it's anger or disappointment, whatever, it... it's my only hope of having a future here.
I'm going to tell them the truth about who I am.
what?
I'm proud of you.
Derek? What are you doing here?
I'm here to win you back.
it's not that easy.
you hurt me. You kind of broke my heart.
I screwed up, I admit that.
I was scared.
scared. Of who?
me, or... maybe Alec?
Sutton came to me with more crazy accusations.
she said she saw you and Alec together at the club, and then, out of the blue, you break up with me.
char, these gentlemen just showed up at the front door.
they said they have some questions for Derek.
Yeah, son. Is that your car out front?
it... It could be. It was an anonymous call.
we need to search the vehicle.
Hey, guys.
Hey. - Hey.
how was your match?
it was brutal. He showed no mercy at all.
Yeah. Win at all costs, right, Dad?
that's your sister, man. Take it easy.
speaking of that, how's our venture capitalist Terry? Any word?
we got a meeting set up with his boss on Monday.
so, meanwhile, I'm just putting the finishing touches on a prospectus.
all right. Well, stay on it.
excuse me a second, guys.
so have you wished Sutton a happy birthday yet?
no, but I will.
Hey, did she seem at all strange to you the other night at dinner?
almost like she was fishing around for something?
Yeah. I noticed that.
what do you got, Dan?
it worked just like you said it would.
they picked up Derek Rogers. He's on his way in.
okay, I'll be right there.
and Dan... - Yes?
good work.
thank you.
Hi! - Hey.
well, aren't we the sweaty one.
Yeah, sorry. Been at it awhile.
Oh, no, it's kind of, um... wow.
the fam's in the big top, decorating for Sutton's birthday party. You should come help.
my mom actually suggested it.
What'd your dad say?
he didn't say anything.
what was he supposed to say?
I don't know.
well, that's a weird look.
what's on your mind, handsome? Spill.
would you hate me if I skipped the party?
no, but I'd be confused.
okay, not exactly an explanation, but I'm not complaing.
just gotta trust me, Laurel.
I'm never gonna let anything come between us.
you're a little low on the right.
I don't want to presume to tell you your business. You're a little low on the right.
perfect! Thanks a lot, fellas.
Hey! I didn't think we were gonna see you till later, kiddo.
your only duty is to show up tonight, and have a great time.
I know. - I know you were expecting to be on the lawn, - but they were predicting rain, so... - Better safe than sorry.
the cake, the cake! No, she can't see the cake!
in the kitchen.
well, now that you're here, you can help.
char's bringing a date, right?
I'm not sure.
I'll go with "Guest" then.
what?
I wanted to tell you something.
it'll be kind of crazy tonight, so I don't know if I'll have the chance.
so these last few weeks have been really great.
how much you've taught me and given me.
okay. - It's not just that.
I have all these new memories like baking cookies and homecoming... boyfriends.
and I know how much you're always there for me.
I always have been and I always will be.
I know that, and I realize how lucky I am.
and how horrible my life might've been if I wasn't here.
and I know you value honesty.
it's really everything, isn't it? I'm with you on this.
these last few weeks, it's like we... we found it again.
I look into your eyes, Sutton, it's the same eyes I looked into when you were two days old - filled with such trust.
we finally got that back and I am so grateful.
this is really hard.
I don't think so. I think the key to love is trust and...
without that, what's left?
sweetie, your long face is killing me.
it is your birthday. Cheer up.
Hey, you mush heads, come on. I think you're jumping the gun.
the party's not till tonight - ooh! Ooh, hey, hey, sweetie.
sweetie, you okay?
I'm fine.
dad, I know... that everything you do, and everything you have done, it's for your family... ...and for your daughters.
I know that.
Whoa! Easy there!
what's up? You're so not supposed to be here yet.
I love you.
okay. Awkward.
I just need to say it before...
before what? The end of the world - is it near?
before things change.
okay, this is freaky.
is this, like, you're pregnant or something? Dying?
just... you are amazing.
okay, that just got frighteningly sincere, which could only mean ulterior motive.
not this time.
okay, well, just in case you had any other ideas,
Sutton Mercer better be at her party tonight.
she will.
guarantee it.
I smell that desert air and I know I'm home.
how 'bout you? Phoenix home for you?
Yeah, it sure is.
actually, I'm home for my birthday.
I couldn't do it.
everything that Kristin just said confirmed the way that she would react.
she's all about trust and-and honesty; two things that I can never have with her.
okay, but you're running out of time.
I'll figure it out.
even if it means coming face-to-face with Sutton.
in fact, maybe that's the key.
I don't know.
what, you think I can't handle her?
she just doesn't always respond well to direct confrontation.
well, I'm not just gonna run away from her.
I want to help you. - I know.
I just, I think this is something I need to do by myself.
where are you going?
to find her before she finds me.
you can't hold him like this. He has rights.
and you're, what, his attorney?
he doesn't have an attorney. Derek doesn't come from money.
these days, who does?
char, enough of this. You're coming home right now.
I'm not going anywhere, Mother.
maybe you should, Char.
Mr. Rybak, I'm here to vouch for Derek. He didn't do anything wrong.
before you go any further, he's being released under his own recognizance.
now, he's still in serious trouble, but if he takes responsibility for his actions, maybe I'll take it easy on him.
you should go home. Phyllis?
shall we?
you go ahead, Mother.
char, this is no... You can't order me around, okay?
you can't control me!
unless you want to drive me away like you did your sister Annie!
I told you I had nothing to do with that.
nothing.
guessing this is about that Derek kid?
no, actually, it's about that name I gave you, that woman Annie Hobbs.
no sign of her yet.
but with just a name and a description to go on, it's not gonna be easy.
well, you keep working on it.
in the meantime... there's something else I need.
Hello?
mother? Dad?
Laurel? Anyone home?
Hello, house!
Hello, ding room.
Hello, ugly painting. I have always hated it.
Hello, fireplace.
Hello, glorious closet!
Hello, my room and my friends...accessories and multi-thread-count sheets! Hello!
Hey, Emma.
and hello, Ethan.
I called. You weren't picking up. Any luck?
no, not really.
I want to be with you for this, all right? I can't just stand here on the sidelines.
well, you're just gonna have to, Ethan.
give me one reason why.
give me a reason why not.
because I love you.
I love you, Emma.
I probably have from the moment I met you.
I wanted to say it today at the country club.
I wanted to say it forever.
and Sutton?
I never loved her. You know that.
Ethan, I,uh... - You don't have to say it.
every time I look at you whenever we're together... it's there.
I need to see you.
I know. Me, too. I want this to be in person.
meet me at the cabin?
we haven't been there since the night that we met.
right. - Okay.
in an hour I'll meet you there.
I love you, Emma.
Hey, there. - Hey.
okay, enough micromanaging for the day. We better get home and change.
plus I think I'm driving everybody crazy.
no different than the nurses at the hospital, I'm sure.
can I ask you something, Daddy?
no, absolutely not.
as my offspring, you're never permitted to ask me a question, so...
what did you say to Justin the other day when you had your little chat?
Why? What'd he say I said?
Hey, I am the one asking the questions here.
okay, if you must know, it was an awkward conversation between a father and the boy who's gotten way too close to his daughter.
and the father showed incredible restraint and modern-day sensitivity and behaved rather admirably, I think.
can we not kid around here?
he's been acting really weird lately.
he even said he might not come to the party tonight.
well, that's ridiculous. Of course he's coming.
he has to come, he's your boyfriend!
he lives above the clubhouse! He has to be come.
can I quote you on that?
no, no, I will deny it.
I love you so much, Daddy.
all right. - Okay, let's go already.
Sutton... look at you!
it's exquisite, if I do say so myself.
it just fits you so beautifully. The shoes, the bow how it...
you don't... have to do that.
I'm... sorry. I was just... going for... mmm, perfection.
like always.
look, thanks, Mother Mom.
I'm gonna make a quick stop, and then I'll see you at the party.
Whoo... very nice.
beautiful. Very nice. - Thank you.
they are gonna be lining up.
I don't know if I'm really ready for that, actually.
right, I'm sorry. I forgot.
so, shall we take one car?
Yeah. Uh, no, actually.
you guys should probably drive yourselves.
you're probably gonna want to stay later than I am, and I still gotta pick up Sutton's gift, so...
What'd you get her?
it wouldn't be a surprise if I told you, now would it?
t... why don't you take the convertible?
be nice to get back into a real car.
especially after that clunker you were driving in L. A.
what kind of a paintless wagon was that?
all right, you look beautiful, honey. - Thanks.
I'll see you at the party. - Okay.
lipstick, and then we can go.
know that look.
Mads, did I ever tell you what I was driving in L. A?
the station wagon?
no, not that I rember.
is it still in L. A?
Yeah. Yeah, it's still there.
you look beautiful.
thank you.
so you're gonna go to the party?
Yes. But I wanted to come here first.
all right, well, I'll come with you.
we can face them together.
do we have to talk about this now?
no.
I want you.
Oh, my God.
right on the first guess!
all it takes is a kiss, right, Emma?
what is wrong with you?!
you set this whole thing up?!
Oh, yeah, that's it, run, Emma.
isn't that what you always do?
run?
all I have done is stay.
stay here, be you.
I wanted to get to you before you got to them!
why is that?
I read the letter to your mother.
Oh, reading other people's mail now!
what is that, like, a federal offense? You're just stacking 'em up!
why won't you listen to her, all right? She did everything for you!
she took your spoiled selfish life and turned it around!
not just with your family, but with Char and Thayer and Mads!
and you.
especially you, right, Ethan?
stop it!
Ethan... she's not gonna listen to you or me.
it's over.
Yeah, hmm, actually, it's not over... Emma.
because when you steal someone else's life, there's always a price.
from the moment you stepped into my shoes, it is always been about making your orphan dreams come true.
what did you think? That you just deserved all of this?
you know, in Vegas I got a chance to walk around in your shoes.
cool place, tons of opportunities, but you just didn't really seem to take advantage because, what, it's just easier to steal my life?
she did not steal your life. You gave it to her!
great, Ethan, blame me for you falling in love with her.
justify cheating by making me the villain.
just tell me, exactly how long have the two of you been sleeping together?
Oh, we didn't have to sleep together to fall in love.
saving it for marriage?
stop it!
all I wanted was for this to be over for us to be sisters, Sutton. Real sisters.
but that was never the idea, was it?
actually... it was... but you screwed it up.
you are a vindictive little bitch.
God, there's that twin thing again.
cause I was just about to call you the same thing.
night, kids.
you're finished here.
Hey, didn't you hear me honking?
Derek's not coming.
he left a message. Something he had to do.
I swear, it had something to do with your dad.
our father tried to help Derek.
the guy's a screw-up, Char.
he's not. He's cute and amazing and... amazing.
and I know I said that twice, but it just shows how deep my feelings are.
but to say that our dad is somehow using Derek...
Mads, it's possible.
there's no way he could have known what car I drove in L. A. unless he'd been there.
we thought that someone had broken in.
okay, so what now? Our dad's a burglar?
look, I'm just thinking out loud.
why don't you think to yourself?
come on. Let's go. We're gonna be late.
I heard a "we" in there.
thought you were alone in L. A. Was there some girl?
Yeah, many, many girls.
are you sure you can dance in those things?
you need to fight! You need to fight this!
Why?
everything Sutton just said was true!
her family, her friends, they will believe her!
I don't stand a chance against her.
Ethan, I'm leaving. I'm gonna go back to Vegas or wherever.
all right, then I'll come with you!
No! - Damn it, Emma!
Ethan, this is over!
how do you not get that?
you have a life here, a brother, a job.
I don't care about any of that! I want you!
it doesn't matter.
I love you!
Ethan, what we had was incredible and magical.
you and me were not meant to happen.
I can't let you just walk out of my life.
okay? I mean it.
I can't let you do this.
I'm doing it.
so, this is either Emma or it's Sutton.
or it's Sutton pretending to be Emma.
or it's Emma pretending to be Sutton.
it's me, goofball; the real Emma.
I know Sutton stayed with you.
Yeah. Look, it thought about calling and warning you, but I kinda figured whatever need to happen should happen.
well, hell hath no fury like a twin scorned.
I'm coming home, Lex.
she's gonna expose me to the family, show that I'm an impostor.
basically, hurt them just to hurt me.
God, that sucks!
I got a pretty good sense of Sutton when she was here, and... I don't know.
I know what you were looking for when you went over there: a sister and a family.
it was just a silly dream.
only if you run away from it.
Lex, I really appreciate the encouragement, but...
look, I just really and truly believe that Sutton is a crazy force of nature.
but I also think that the only way she's gonna accept you is if you stand up to her.
Yeah, I tried that.
got ugly, did it?
way ugly.
well, nothing good ever happens without a fight, right?
Emma, maybe what you're looking for is there, not here.
crazy, look at this place.
poor guy, he doesn't get out much.
love the bracelet.
Oh, thanks. Just a little gift from my squeeze.
Hey, that's between us.
so, why is Sutton not here yet?
always fashionably late.
and look who's obnoxiously early.
I'll take care of this.
this nasty crashing habit really needs to stop.
who says I wasn't invited?
I'd be happy to say it.
well, for your information, Sutton invited me.
called me yesterday and said it was time we all made peace.
she never told me that.
God, I hope that wasn't the reason.
come on, guys. Let's go check out that obscene pile of gifts.
rember last year when she actually registered?
guys, Thayer, Justin, glad you decided to join us.
well, I couldn't let Laurel down, now could I?
Justin, you know, the other day, you said some things...
I want to apologize.
in my life I have trouble finding adults that I can trust as much as my mother and father.
they tend to suspect people of things.
do you suspect me of anything?
no. No, not at all.
Justin, is Dr. Mercer giving you a hard time?
no, ma'am.
and if you guys don't mind, I think that Laurel is looking for me.
I think she is.
you two guys okay?
honestly, I don't know. There's just something strange.
you feel it, too, right?
no. When I look at Justin, I see a boy madly in love with Laurel.
and yes, it scares me, but it's so wonderful to see how happy she is.
we finally have things with dad under control, and you have to start again with all these suspicions.
all dad wants is for us to be together.
just a real family. And honestly, that's all I want to.
okay. Look, it's one thing to want that, and it's another thing to bury your heads in the sand.
I'll be right back.
who are you looking for, Emma or Sutton?
Emma's not coming.
I figured Sutton would already be here.
so you know she's in Phoenix?
we saw her at the cabin.
now I'm pretty sure she's coming here to drop her last bomb.
and I'm assuming you want to stop her.
somebody's got to.
you're here! - Finally!
we were worried. - Happy birthday.
happy birthday. - Thank you.
why are you all wet? Is it raing outside?
Yeah.
you're wearing a different dress, sweetie? Was it 'cause I was fussing too much?
I get it. You don't like it.
no, I loved it. I... it was... the seam had a tear.
excuse me.
there's the birthday girl. Come on, I know it's your birthday, but we got a schedule here - dancing, cake, come on.
wait, are you okay?
Yeah. Just a crazy day.
dad, excuse me. I'm sorry.
it's me. It's me.
you didn't leave?
you were right. I need to stand up for myself.
I don't get it. Why isn't she here? She left before us.
I have no idea where she is.
look, Emma, what you said at the cabin...
do you love me? - You know I do.
then it doesn't matter.
it doesn't matter because whatever happens tonight or tomorrow, or the next day, we will go down fighting.
you and me. Together.
Ethan. I love you.
there you are.
happy birthday.
okay, everybody, where's the birthday girl? - Thank you.
time to dance. - You look beautiful.
and everybody gets a spin with Sutton!
lucky me.
mind if I have the first dance?
Yeah.
you're awful late.
punch?
did you get Sutton's gift?
sure did. It's on the table with the rest of them.
so how long were you in L. A.spying on me?
there is no way you could've known what I was driving.
you got me. I was snooping on Mads' phone.
I saw a picture of you in front of some old clunker, and I just assumed it was yours. Was I wrong?
is everything okay, T?
cause I get the feeling there's something you're not talking to me about.
I'm not... I'm not prying, I'm just... I'm concerned.
I'm sorry.
I just... I guess I just keeping listening to the wrong people.
all right, everyone!
everyone, if I could have your attention, please!
if you could have your attention, please.
here we go!
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday, dear Sutton
happy birthday to you.
speech!
this has been such an amazing night.
and... now I've gotten what I so desperately wanted, always.
this place and you guys...
it's really been a dream come true.
and now it's time to tell you what I could never tell you before the truth about who I really am.
the truth is...
and that truth is...
I love you.
each and every one.
excuse me.
Sutton, is that you?
Sutton. What are doing out here?
a few months ago, I discoverd I had a twin sister.
and then she asked me to take her place, keep the secret, find our real mother and try to stay alive.
put yourself in my shoes.
how long could you keep up the lying game?
this is annie sewell.
it's rebecca now.
you want to keep the past in the past?
do you think that's possible?
I'd like nothing better.
I lost your mother's bracelet.
she was wearing it the day that she died.
you're getting soft, man.
go in there right now and break up with her.
her car is missing. Sutton is missing.
this your family's car, sutton?
Dan, I took the car, okay?
I haven't seen you guys since santa barbara -- Got to be 20 years.
Annie, right? -- Kristin.
I just found this on the back walk.
keep on being Sutton...or you're next.
Oh, my god.
and here we go.
this is not cool.
not cool?
Ethan, this is terrifying.
keep on being sutton or you're next"?
I... No, we have to tell somebody.
guys, guys, we don't want to overreact.
I hear you.
did you not read this?
I shouldn't even be touching it. It could be evidence.
the thing is, the person most likely to write that note is sutton.
em, this feels like a lying game.
why play one now?
she was on her way to the party to expose us.
maybe she found a nastier way to do it.
look. All right.
there's something you need to understand about her, okay?
Sutton pulled a lying game on this transfer girl a few years ago.
she was from back east.
so she would... Steal things from her, like, uh, earrings, cell phone, her retainer.
Hillary, that was her name. - -Yeah.
soon as hillary would replace the things, sutton would send the original one back to her wrapped up like a present, cryptic notes attached to them, warning her to be more careful or whatever.
and it was just little things.
enough to make her look like a fool.
and it worked - I mean, the girl ended up transferring to another school.
so sutton won.
okay, that's horrible- No question
but we're dealing with a missing person here.
we have a scrap of a dress.
this is a little bit more serious.
Yeah, but all the presents she sent
white paper, black bow.
right. This... This became her thing, her signature.
which is why, for now, I say we lay low and just see what her next move is.
so I'm just supposed to go to school - and pretend I'm not freaking out? - Yeah.
guys, I have a really bad feeling about this.
I know it's hard, but we need to try and act normal for right now
till we get this thing figured out. - He's right.
because the only way to win a Lying game is not to play.
danica patrick. 't pull up a chair.
I'm actually late.
well, then, we'll make it quick. Sit.
is this about the car?
Yes. - No. No.
Yes. - No, it's... No, it's about the car and college and tennis and your whole future, sutton.
dad, please. I know this was a big deal, and I'm not trying to get out of a punishment or anything, but I also don't want you to read any more into it.
it was a huge mistake.
just one last thing before turning 17.
and... I will pay for it with my own money.
this isn't about the money.
although we appreciate you taking responsibility.
I promise, it will never happen again.
I really have to go.
we're not done talking about this.
okay.
Hey. I got char's text. What happened?
we just spent a half hour reeling in phyllis
soused on a pool raft.
it was like an episode of celebrity rehab without the celebrity.
Yeah. Happy hour came early for her.
char left messages for her dad, but he's at some conference in miami.
for a change. -- oh.
I wish char could just stay with me.
Yeah, not happening.
Phyllis can't stand your mom.
or my dad, so my place is out, too.
you know, one totally cool person so far in all this has been rebecca.
she's really pushing char's dad to let her stay here with her, but, then, phyllis barely speaks to rebecca, so... It's crazy.
they were all actually friends at one point.
no way.
mom, wait! Char wait for me
poor char. It's a lot to handle alone.
so, someone bolted out of the house this morning after receiving a very mysterious and urgent text.
Oh. That was char. She just needed help with her mom.
okay, don't tell me. I really don't care.
Laurel, wait... I want to be able to tell you everything. I...
Hey, there you are.
so I called my dad to see if he could help out with the whole...
char sitch.
I mean, I feel so bad for her. She's got no one and...
Oh, my god.
what?
look who's back in school.
Hey! Derek!
Hello!
what are you... What are you doing here?
you don't know the whole story.
I want you to tell me what happened the night of my party.
look, what do you want from me?
I want you to apologize.
I want you to beg for forgiveness.
char? - -Yes, char!
her life just imploded, and you couldn't even pick up a phone?
Really? Classy, derek. Classy.
what's going on with trans am over there?
nothing. It's just, he...Nothing.
it's going to be all right. All right?
Yeah, you wouldn't be so relaxed if the note said you are next.
I guess I'm saying, now at least it seems like she's back to being a typical teenager, warts and all.
maybe trashing cars is some sign of a return to normalcy.
well, it's not exactly what I want to put in the christmas letter.
Hey, I'll take harebrained teen over sullen, depressive any day.
Hi.
Hey, rebecca. What a nice surprise.
isn't it?
why don't you go on? I'll catch up with you.
Oh. Okay.
I'm just so glad to see you here.
I can't imagine you've had much time to relax since being back.
Yeah, it's been a little crazy.
we're just all trying to figure out the best solution for char.
it's never simple.
nothing is ever simple with kids.
Oh, well, of course, you would know.
so you're applying for membership?
Yeah, I thought it would be a good way to meet people.
you know, I moved away to california 20 years ago, so all of my friends are gone.
well, it can't be easy.
I mean, I think everyone we know is through our kids' school and activities.
so I guess I should find some kids.
well, while you're looking, please feel free to use us as a source.
that's very kind of you. Thank you.
I was wanting to ask you something.
we have an anniversary coming up, and I was wanting to surprise ted with a california escape.
any suggestions?
Yeah. There's big sur and palm springs. Napa.
what about santa barbara?
huh. You know, that is the one place I've never been.
Sutton, playoffs are coming up.
get your head in the drill.
get your head in the drill now.
Hey. Hey. You all right?
you okay out there?
what's wrong?
what do you want from me?
Hey, Randy! -- Hey, ted.
Hey, how are you, guy? -- I'm good.
I don't think sutton remembers me, though.
I guess not. Sectionals last spring?
right. Right. I'm sorry. I...
listen, I'm sure you've seen many coaches.
Hey, but, you know, tsnu's still at the top of our list.
go, copperheads!
spoken like a die-hard alum
but we'd like to hear it from the player who's applying.
right, yeah. It sounds like a... Great school.
Yeah, randy, this is sutton's friend, uh, ethan whitehorse.
sir. How you doing, son?
Randy taylor, assistant coach, women tennis, texas sutter north university.
I'm in town unofficially, in no way violating any recruiting restrictions.
so you mean you're not offering us a car?
it's good to know we're still on your dance card.
so, listen, the next step would be to get you out there.
you know, meet the coaches, watch practice, maybe talk to admissions?
sure, of course. Yeah.
Yeah, we'll look at our schedule, pick some dates.
by the time you apply, we're going to have eight new scholarship spots.
four of those are free ride, so if you're serious about the copperheads, you need to throw your hat in the ring.
like I said, well, you know, sutton's pretty busy with school right now and...
how about this week?
strike while the iron's hot. I like that.
honey, you don't have to feel pressured into this.
no, it's fine. I want to.
be a nice break from the dull routine.
well, then, I'll set it up.
are you guys sure this is a good idea?
no, I-I don't know.
I mean, it's better than walking around school in terror, waiting for some lunatic to come after me.
but at least here, I can protect you.
since when was sutton so hell-bent on going to texas sutter north, anyway?
or college, for that matter?
I think that was more of her dad's dream.
I mean, she was into the idea of living the sorority life.
I guess if you're into Lying games, there's no better venue.
can you imagine four free years? Just to play tennis?
God, I would kill for that.
you know what? This could be perfect.
I mean, sutton hated it when you hijacked her social life, right?
so if you were to use her name to get into college, she'd go ape.
it's a good call.
I'm not trying to use her name.
Yeah, we know that, but she doesn't.
and the second she finds out about it, that's it. Game over.
you win. She'll come out in the open, want her life back, and confess to this whole Lying game.
gotta go.
you've got a death grip on that club. Relax.
why are you so tense? -- 'cause you're watching me.
see, when nobody's watching me, I'm perfect.
just trying to keep you honest.
there are my boys!
Hey.
Oh, by the way, I thought you might like to see...
you found it!
actually, my dad did. So you can thank him.
and breathe easy again.
hope I didn't make too big of a deal out of it.
it's just that... It had a real personal connection.
my mom was wearing it the day that she died.
Yeah, laurel was telling me. Car accident, right?
that's right.
Aweaken Hope Recovery Center
I feel terrible. I feel like i'm committing my sister.
aren't you?
don't be glib.
I need you to give me a euphemism.
you know? You used to be good at that, at least that's what I remember.
you're getting her the help she needs.
was that so hard?
look, it's her multiple duis that are going to keep her in this facility until she accepts that help, so don't feel bad.
well, we need to discuss char.
char? She'll probably stay with her father.
which is a shame,'cause they're not that close.
he's married to his job. I know she'd much stay here.
Yeah. I'd much rather she stay here with me.
at the house. Just until phyllis gets back on her feet.
well, the courts are always more sympathetic to a blood relative.
the courts... -- I'm just saying, if it came to that.
so where does that leave us?
I don't know, alec. I guess you're right. I guess...
the best option for her is to just stay with her father for now.
I can see what you're doing here.
convince dad that you're all pumped about tsnu, and he'll ease up on the hard-ass parenting regime, am I right?
no. That's not what i'm doing at all.
I just want to... Get a feel for the school.
Oh, please!
what happened to,"i'm only applying to california schools"?
I mean, that's all we heard last summer.--I could change my mind.
well, I gotta hand it to you, you're good.
they totally bought it.
dad's already polishing his cowboy boots.
why is it so hard to believe that I want to visit a college with no ulterior motive?
uh, maybe because I know you.
just... Be careful, because you're playing with fire.
you know how much dad loves that school.
if he finds out that this is all an act...
it'll be nana's funeral all over again.
so now you're not going to college?
you know, people are going to start thinking you're indecisive.
I'm sorry, but when laurel starts thinking that I'm playing ted and kristin, it's gone too far.
if this is a Lying game, I just want it to end.
I'm going to the police.
if that's what you want, i'm with you.
Dan is supposed to be off tonight.
he should be at home. -- Okay.
what's he doing here?
kill the engine.
something's not right here.
you still want to go to the cops?
so, what, you guys weren't even going to tell me you were going to the cops?
dude. This isn't really about you.
uh... When the police learn that I knew sutton was missing and hadn't come forward?
Yeah. It'll be about me, too.
we just got a really weird vibe out at the trailer.
can you think of any reason why your dad would be arguing with dan?
das work with cops every day.
arguing just goes with the territory.
no, this didn't feel like regular work stuff, man.
it seemed personal.
and I think I heard derek's name.
I wasn't there, so I can't really play hardy boys with you.
obviously, there's no one we can trust here, so what am I supposed to do?
just wait until the next note shows up?
no. Go to the college, it'll buy us some time.
I still say sutton could ambush you while you're there.
she could just be waiting till the last possible minute to blow you out of the water.
this is you selling me on the plan?
you'll do great.
fine. I will go.
but if sutton doesn't show herself by the time I get back, we are ending this.
all right.
well, well. Look at my tax dollars at work.
what's up? Pull up a chair. Join me.
unless you, uh... Got like a book report due or something.
suppose I could spare a few minutes.
Thanks, but, um... I'll pass.
what's going on with you and sutton?
she's away looking at colleges.
let me ask you something. She helping you with your college list?
you know, getting you to... Hone it down to your top five or six?
Uh-oh. You know, I was really thinking that could be a cool brother thing, for you and I to do.
we could draw on your vast college experience.
touch? kid, touch? I like that.
so, uh... I was coming home after work last night,
I thought I saw alec's car out here.
that so? - Yeah, it seemed like you guys were getting into it about something.
you mind if I ask what?
Oh, the no-huddle offense.
I think it really wears out the d, you know?
but alec thinks it leads to sloppy play and turnovers.
we just... Agree to disagree.
you always do this.
you act like you're here for me, and the second I bring up anything about alec, you just shut down.
you a shrink, now?
Hey, there's something you could study in school, psychology. Yeah.
just forget it, man.
all right, fine, ethan. You really want to know?
Yes, I really want to know.
sit down.
a few years back, when I had that summer job working as a caddy at the club, one of the rich girls, paige billings, mm.
the third. As she liked to remind people.
she invited me to a party with her friends up on that hill, near the seventh green.
she was hot, so I was like, hell, yeah, I'm coming.
we got hammered.
and unbeknownst to me, little miss paige had been popping prescription drugs, too.
she od'd.
damn.
I was totally innocent, but when something...
bad happens between a rich kid and someone like you and me, you bet your dream catcher, kid, you're the one getting popped.
I was looking at 25 to 40 years. For dealing.
Alec made it go away.
so do I owe the guy?
Yeah, dude, I owe him my life.
so... How do you know when you've paid off the debt?
and there I was, thinking you coming over here, bringing us lunch, might have a hidden agenda.
well, it's just that most people in your position wouldn't really bother to help a guy like derek.
and you just seem to go out of your way to.
so, I've always wondered why.
why wouldn't you think I was just being a good person?
you know, treating my fellow man with the kindness I expect to be treated with?
not for a sec.
my man! That's my boy.
well, t,I guess I just have a soft spot... For the underdog.
that, I might believe.
and, plus...
you never know when you could use another friend.
okay, now zeta kappa gamma down to the left.
and the big fraternities right at the end of this row.
can we check out chandler?
the lib... You want to see the library?
Yeah. It's like the fifth largest in the country.
well, we'll go see for ourselves.
okay.
you love this place.
are you kidding? It's paradise!
I mean... And look at all these knuckleheads.
none of them know how good they have it.
it's, honest to god
and nothing compares to the feeling of having kids
but this may have been the best four years of my life.
it's really the only time you were ever away from alec, right?
what are you talking about?
nothing, it just... Struck me.
Alec's been a loyal supporter of this family for a long time, sutton.
I know. I know. Sometimes...
he scares me.
what are you talking about? He's your godfather!
for heaven's... Did someone say something to you?
no. No, it's stupid. Forget I even mentioned it.
I can't imagine where I would be without some of the things he's done for me.
for our family. Don't ever forget that.
come on. Let's go see the library.
it's like this wall went up the second I mentioned his name.
the same thing happened when I brought it up with Dan.
it's like, um... It's like he's got this hold over people.
it's like everybody is afraid of him.
and no sign of sutton, obviously?
Mmm-mm. Isn't this weird, me video-chatting with you a thousand miles away?
Yeah, let's not make it a habit of it, okay?
I don't intend to.
you know, last year I could even imagine going to college and I don't know, now that I'm here, maybe, finally when everything comes out, ted will accept me into the family and I could get in on my own merit, my own name.
I know, I know, It's a stupid fantasy.
you're gonna go to college, emma.
you're gonna go someplace great, I know it.
this is so awesome.
look, I wish, oh, you have to see this campus.
it, like, takes your breath away.
and the history And the freedom. can I tell you something?
I couldn't imagine being here without you.
well, then we got a problem, don't we?
because I don't Think our boy's gpa is Getting him to austin anytime soon.
Hey, sutton. -- hi.
shouldn't you be resting up For your big day?
cause I don't want my little bro here getting blamed if you blow your interview 'cause you been up all night yammering with him.
all right, come on, man, back off. What are you doing?
don't you see, kid? This girl's not like you and me.
she's going places. College-bound!
ain't that right, sutton?
I'm gonna go. Bye, ethan.
wait. Just wait.
get off me.
don't ever compare us, okay?
I still have some hope.
something you gave up when you became alec's bitch.
Sutton? Are you in there? Sutton?
Sutton, come back.
come on, sutton, this is a big day.
Sutton? Sutton? Sutton, honey?
you must have overslept your alarm.
come on. Big day.
nice dig, grace. Katie, keep that racquet head up.
so, sutton, you like what you see?
Yeah, they're all so amazing.
more important, they're a team.
college tennis means a lot of six-hour van rides.
chemistry's the x factor. If you want to be a small part in something big, we'd love to have you.
if you want to be a big part in something small, this is the wrong fit.
I get what you're saying.
do you? - Mm-hmm.
look, here's the deal:
at junior tournaments, coaches talk, you hear things.
I understand in the past, sutton mercer's had a bit of a mean girl rep.
that's... So over.
I'm a totally different person now.
Hey, it's music to my ears.
level with me, randy. Do you think she can really compete at this level?
Yeah. There's no doubt she has the skill.
but is her heart in it?
well, you saw her. She was the one driving this visit.
we saw that.
bu I also know that we sent her a recruiting package along with 19 other top prospects.
we're not allowed to follow up. They have to contact us.
now, you want to take a guess out of that group of girls of how many of 'em didn't bother calling us back?
Hey, mister. Hey, phil.
um, what happened to our latte date during free block?
right. Uh, I must have overslept.
okay. Well, I can heat it up for you if you want.
no, that's okay. We're in the middle of something, so...
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to...
no, it's cool. Catch you later?
Yeah, see you at practice.
Hey, and maybe we could hit some chip shots after, 'cause you know, my short game is falling apart.
is everything okay here... With us?
sure. I was just trying to make a plan with a teammate.
didn't realize that was a problem.
no, it's not.
Justin, why are you talking like this?
like what? God, I feel like everything I do is wrong somehow.
it seems like I can't win here.
win? You seem angry.
Oh, so now I'm angry?
okay. Well, since apparently you can read my mind, why don't you tell me what else I'm feeling right now?
Justin, do you not want to be going out with me?
I don't know. I mean, obviously, things aren't going great, and maybe we need time apart.
you're breaking up with me?
I don't know. May-maybe.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm sorry.
you know this is super casual, right?
an interview's an interview.
Yeah, but you're... You're a junior, honey, okay?
this is an unofficial visit. There's zero pressure.
all it is is just a chance for you to be yourself.
Yeah, but I just, I don't want to let everyone down.
let you down.
look, honey, I know these past few months have been tough, but I'm not thinking about that now.
I'm remembering the last 17 years.
hey... I want you to know. What a joy it has been to raise you and to see you grow into this beautiful, young, amazing woman.
honey, I wouldn't trade a minute of it.
Thanks.
Oh, mom said she'd call.
how about that?
perfect timing, honey.
I thought I told you never to call me that, ted.
Oh, alec.
I was just calling to check on our girl, see how she's doing.
Yeah, everything's good.
we're just about to head into the admissions.
she's actually been asking some odd questions about you, though.
Oh, yeah? Like what?
just like why you're so intense.
you want to remind her what might happen to my friends if I were to, say, go all soft and play the clown?
Yeah, no, I understand all that.
I'm just saying, she's under a lot of pressure.
so, next time you see her, just take it down a notch.
okay, ted. Thanks for the tip.
I got to take this.
Hello?
Hey, sorry to bother you at home, but the other night, at the trailer, we had company.
it doesn't make any sense.
he was always so awesome and into me, and now, suddenly, it's over? why?
Oh, honey, I'm just so sorry.
I mean, you guys are still so young.
maybe... Maybe he just thought you were moving too fast.
but he didn't even explain why.
it was just like,"see ya.
I wish sutton were here to talk to.
it's just not fair.
honey, I'm so sorry.
I like the upward trend I see in your grades this semester.
I have awesome teachers.
because I'll be frank,
I know that you're an athlete and a legacy.
but up until now, you were a long shot.
but I'm glad to see that you're turning things around and taking ownership of your future.
I really have tried.
so, tell me, what changed? I see the numbers, but I want to meet the person behind the numbers.
so, who is sutton mercer, and how did she get to where she is today?
W - well, I guess... For a long time,
I was just... Coasting... Through life, taking everything for granted, including the people around me.
and I never really thought about the future, or even believed that I had one.
at least not one worth dreaming about, anyway.
and then one day, I don't know, things just changed.
it's like I got a second chance in life, and, for the first time ever, I saw hope.
and suddenly I realized I am surrounded by these amazing and wonderful people who I love and who I felt love me, and it was almost perfect.
and I... I just feel like i'm living this dream, and, and I... Would do anything... I mean, anything...
to have this dream just for one more day.
the travelers return.
so? Did you love it?
did she have a choice?
it was amazing.
face it, honey, there's two kinds of people in this world, copperheads and those who wish they were.
guys...
don't we have another daughter around here somewhere?
actually, she's... She's really upset.
Justin broke up with her.
she's been waiting for you.
Oh, poor laurel. Mm.
that little bastard.
Ted! Isn't this what we were hoping for?
no, I don't want to see laurel get hurt.
did he give a reason?
well, that's why she's upset. It was very odd, like there was something he wasn't telling her.
Mm-hmm.
and that's the weirdest part.
I swear, I have no clue why.
you deserve an explanation, so you can make sense of it and...
please don't say "move on.
sorry.
you want to know the craziest thing?
and this might sound loony, but I get the sense that it has something to do with dad.
Seriously?
they've been acting... Completely weird around each other, and justin's been saying all these random things like, dad's not this great guy everyone thinks he is.
okay, yeah, you need to talk to him when you feel stronger.
but not at school. It's too public - He might feel cornered.
just drop by his place and hear his side of things.
he owes you that much.
you're the best.
yeah? Feel better?
God, no. I want to die.
but, you know, thanks for being here for me.
of course.
all right, I'll see you later.
still no answer.
I told you. Thayer's gone awol.
he said something vague about one more thing he needed to check.
his dad was a dead end.
okay, well, we need to find him, because I almost threw up in that interview.
and then I have ted telling me how proud he is of me.
I know. It's messed up.
Ethan, that nightmare was so real. It's so awful.
I mean, if sutton is gone
don't you think her family deserves to know?
we've had some awesome times here.
and we'll have more.
God alone knows when we shall see each other again.
and we shall leave it up to him to find out.
Oh, come on, you cannot have forgotten.
middle school fiddler.
Oh, yeah. Duh.
I was so psyched to get hodel's song, and then the music started and I totally froze.
you spoke the entire song.
it was hilarious.
Oh, your mother was ready to kill you.
this is so unfair.
this really sucks.
I know. My aunt tried everything she could to have me stay, but in the end it was my dad's decision.
I guess he wants me after all.
I hate to say this, girls.
I guess it's time.
Hello, ted.
Rebecca, I'm so glad you called.
please, come in, come in. - Thank you.
you know char. And I could tell that she didn't want to go.
and I guess he's sort of an awful man.
it's... It's a really difficult situation.
part of me just wants to say,"stay here at the house with me," you know, but you know how phyllis would react and I couldn't just take someone else's child.
I mean, who does that?
well, for what it's worth, I...
I think you're doing the right thing.
Really? - Mm-hmm.
Whew. Thank you. Thank you.
that really means a lot to me coming from you.
you don't find this beyond disturbing?
would you prefer that they were totally awkward around one another?
I'd prefer that rebecca sewell wasn't curled up on my couch at home getting all chummy with my wife.
let's give her the benefit of the doubt, what do you say?
she's been really helpful with this char business, and people can change.
you really believe that?
I got to take this.
what?
Hey.
thought we should talk about what happened earlier at school.
Justin, come on, that wasn't us.
we never treated each other like that.
just so you know, I was trying to let you down easy.
so you've really just wasted your time.
please, can we not do this here?
I was hoping we could go to your room and talk.
trust me, you don't... Want to do that.
you're with someone?
when I was walking around the campus,
I actually thought: what if?
what if sutton just never came back.
and I took over her life. Forever.
and you know, for like a split second,
I thought somehow that that would be okay.
how sick is that?
and, I mean, what happened to us?
it's like our moral compass just snapped.
none of this is your fault.
I really think it is.
maybe I just got what I wanted all along.
dude, where have you been?
I think sutton's dead.
and I'm pretty sure I know who killed her.
once we finally stopped suspecting one another,
I started thinking: who would really want to kill sutton?
it'd have to be some kind of psycho.
exactly. But I was bumping on the note.
it was too much like a Lying game, you know, and then she didn't show up at the college, so I thought, you know, maybe someone else did write it, but who would want emma to keep on being sutton?
someone who doesn't want the secret of the twins to be out.
Yeah, and who would go to such crazy extremes to protect that secret?
maybe a birth mother who never wanted to be found.
now, rember what the guy in the vegas juvie center told us?
Emma becker had been sent from some psych ward in l. a.
I totally forgot about that.
and then I rembered the list of addresses that I gave sutton for the art gallery.
Mm-hmm. One of them was this psychiatric clinic in l. a.
Oh, my god.
Yeah, so I called, pretending to be, like, some assistant at the gallery, and guess what
Annie hobbs broke out of the place last week and just... Vanished.
seeing sutton after all these years, she must have just lost it.
this isn't a Lying game.
I'm really sorry I had to tell you this.
you know, ever since I had that dream, I knew.
I have to go tell her family.
mom? dad? Anyone home?
come on.
I can't believe this is happening.
you know, it's funny.
just standing here, you can feel her everywhere, so alive.
I can't even believe that she could be gone...
forever.
you know, as bad as things ended, we did have some good times together.
she was unpredictable.
you just held your breath and went along for the ride.
I think I've been in love with sutton mercer since the second grade.
I remember, once, she came over with mads for a playdate, and I actually got tongue-tied.
in front of a seven-year-old.
even then, she had this crazy confidence.
you were just drawn to her.
I'll never forget...
the first time I heard her voice.
God, it was like this. Electric charge. My sister.
it's my sister and my twin.
I feel bad that I... I didn't know her as well as you guys did, but if I had, you can be sure that we would have been inseparable.
thank you for sharing your friends and your family with me.
they've really... Changed my life.
well, isn't this cozy?
I'm sorry. Have I come at a bad time?
a few months ago, I discovered I had a twin sister, and then she asked me to take her place, keep the secret, find our real mother and try to stay alive.
put yourself in my shoes.
how long could you keep up the lying game?
you are a vindictive little bitch.
you're finished here.
what else did Ted tell you?
I want to keep the past in the past.
I've had enough drama in my life. I don't really want to go digging around for more.
I'd prefer that rebecca wasn't curled up on my couch at home, getting all chummy with my wife.
maybe we need time apart.
you're breaking up with me?
Yeah, I guess so.
I think sutton's dead. And I'm pretty sure I know who killed her.
maybe a birth mother who never wanted to be found.
it's annie hobbs. She's escaped.
I'm sorry. Have I come at a bad time?
Sutton! - You're alive!
did I just walk in on my own funeral?
because if so, I've got to say...
the turnout kind of sucks.
Oh, my god, Sutton, we've been freaking out over here.
Yeah, you and me both.
where the hell have you been?
we must've left you a hundred messages.
did it ever occur to you to let someone know you were okay?
well, if I could have, I would have, ethan.
anyway, I wasn't aware that my well-being was such a concern for people who think I'm such a - what was it again?
vindictive little bitch.
we're glad you're okay.
but Ethan's right. Making us worry like that is sick.
even for you.
someone dropped that off at your house the night after you disappeared.
came wrapped in a present with a piece of the dress that you were wearing that night.
sound familiar?
Ethan... - No, it's okay.
just want to know what she thinks.
I mean, this is the first time you're hearing about any of this, right?
what are you trying to say, Ethan?
that I wrote this note?
that it was just all part of some crazy plan to get back at you for,
I don't know, stabbing me in the back?
I don't know who wrote this note, but one thing in it is definitely true.
somebody did try to kill me.
well, this place brings back fun memories.
well, where else could we go?
my parents - I mean, Ted and kristin were gonna come home any minute.
how are they?
good.
so you still haven't told us what happened that night.
well, I was on my way to the party, and...
someone jumped up from the backseat and grabbed me.
and that's when you went into the water?
how did you know?
your family's car - The cops pulled it out of the lake the other day.
Emma took the heat for stealing it.
doesn't matter.
did you see who attacked you?
no, no. It happened so fast I couldn't see a face.
okay, I know this is going to sound crazy, but we were all thinking annie hobbs had something to do with it.
no, you're way off. In fact, if there's one person who didn't try to kill me, it was her.
how can you be so sure?
because our mother was the one who saved my life.
so, I saw your car at the club when I was leaving with laurel.
what were you doing there so late?
I was just talking to Alec about a few things.
lost track of time.
how is Laurel?
she's a 16-year-old who just had her first heartbreak.
she's a mess.
how'd your little heart-to-heart with rebecca go?
well, it's a tough situation with phyllis and char.
I think she just needed someone to listen.
kind of weird, though, she came to you.
I mean, you guys, you barely know each other.
well, that could change soon.
you know the junior ballet benefit I co-host with phyllis every year?
Yeah, the one where phyllis volunteers her backyard and you do all the work.
that is the one.
well, Rebecca has graciously offered to step in for phyllis.
I think she really wants us to be friends.
well, then that is good news.
so I don't rember the crash or going into the water, but the next thing I knew, I was waking up in a motel room.
and then, there she was.
your mother? Really?
she was... So kind.
and she took care of me, she went over to the diner next door, got me food.
did she tell you how you got there?
I mean, you were trapped in a car underwater.
she said that she was following me that night.
and she saw the crash, she saw me go into the water, and then she saw a dark-haired guy swim to shore and climb out of the lake.
she didn't see his face.
okay, so how'd you get out?
you should've drowned.
Annie said she dove in and pulled me out of the water.
what do you think, i'm making this up?
no. It's just kind of weird.
someone tried to kill me!
they could be watching us right now. And Emma is in danger.
in fact, we all are until we figure out who did this.
where is Annie now?
she's at range creek motel, room 134.
I just left her there about an hour ago.
she was fine yesterday, and then this morning, I said something about leaving, and she flipped out and turned into a completely different person.
and I waited until she fell asleep and came here.
so, if annie's here like you said, I think it's very important that we talk to her.
he's right, we need to hurry.
and you, Emma, need to get back to my house before somebody notices that you're gone.
no. What, after all this time?
if our birth mother is here, I want to meet her.
and you will.
but if someone thinks I'm dead, we can't risk being seen together.
and until this cut on my head heals, you need to keep being me.
okay. Let's go meet mom.
nothing.
she's gone.
big surprise.
so, you guys ready to go or... Want to head next door and look for the easter bunny?
No! She was here.
why would I make something like this up?
you mean other than to completely screw over three people who used to care about you?
all right, give me five minutes.
I'll check the front desk and see if anyone saw anything.
Ethan, I know you probably won't believe me, but...
I really am sorry for all the strain I put on you guys.
I had no idea things would... - Yeah.
you're right. I don't believe you.
room 134?
Oh, right. Hot girl. Nice eyes.
had kind of a nasty ding on her forehead, though.
Yeah, that's her.
I was actually wondering about the other person in the room. Woman, early 40s?
Nah, I didn't see anybody like that.
s - so, the chick with the bump on her head, is, uh, she, like, your girlfriend or something?
cause she was really... - No, she's not.
listen, is there any way you could check your records?
are you kidding me?
with all these people coming and going at all hours, most of them paying cash?
I mean, you do realize this ain't the four seasons, right?
I'm home!
Hey, what are you still doing up?
nothing. Just sitting here, wondering if it's too late to call justin.
I'm not going to beg him to take me back or anything.
I just wanted to scream at him a little, tell him what an ass he's been.
Yeah. Too late for that.
probably should have seen it coming, right?
I mean, our whole relationship started as a lie.
fake parents, fake address.
why should I be surprised he was seeing other girls?
you make a good point.
okay, what can I do to help?
well... - Hmm?
you could always help me steal Justin's car, maybe sink it in the lake?
Yeah, uh, I'm not gonna do that. - Okay.
it was worth a shot. - Yeah.
look, I understand why you wouldn't believe me.
Yeah, and?
and I think we both know that the old sutton was capable of something so elaborate and heartless.
the old Sutton?
I'm not that girl anymore.
and I'm supposed to believe this because...?
because I'm different. Because...
well, when you've been through something like I have, it changes you.
and... After I was attacked, I realized how badly I've treated you.
I just want another chance.
as friends. That's it - Friends.
what happened? Did someone see her?
afraid not.
so you think I'm lying, too?
I know it sounds crazy, but she seems so convinced.
well, all I know is what thayer and I saw at the hotel room, and that's nothing.
but what if it is true?
or what if some version of what she's saying really did happen?
that means that there's somebody out there who is willing to kill to hide the fact that there are two of us.
look, look, this is exactly what you can't do, emma.
you can't let her suck you in. You can't trust her.
so what do we do?
we watch her.
well, where is she now?
well, obviously, she can't stay here.
so... She's at thayer's.
actually, I kind of let it slip that dan was out of town on a fishing trip.
which I'm already starting to regret.
no. It's fine. It's great.
hope it's okay I borrowed your robe.
totally okay. It's Dan's.
here. Emma packed this stuff for you.
Thanks.
look, I know you're mad, but I... I do appreciate you letting me stay here.
well, it's only for a couple nights, and you didn't give me much of a choice.
right.
hard to believe, though.
what is?
well, that we've known each other for so long and this is the first time i'm in your house.
you must have hit your head pretty hard, huh?
Yeah. Why?
because, if you had any recollection of you and me together, you'd know that there's nothing surprising about that at all.
good night, Sutton.
morning.
expecting someone else?
Ethan had to go to school, so he asked me to stop by.
made you eggs.
Thanks. - Yeah, no problem.
look, I really can't stay long.
Ethan said he'll check on you at lunch.
in the meantime, I brought you some supplies.
got you some food, magazines, prepaid phone.
while you're alone, you should probably just stay inside and, obviously, don't let anybody in.
of course.
Hey, Thayer. - Yeah?
look, I know we didn't... Exactly leave things in l. a. On... On the best of terms.
just want you to know... - Let me guess.
you appreciate everything I've done for you, you value my friendship and my support, and you don't know what you would ever do without me.
you make that sound like it's a bad thing.
well, maybe, for me, it is.
Sutton, things ended badly between us in L.A. For one reason.
you knew how I felt about you, and you still slept with me just to get back at Ethan.
I'm sorry. It was a mistake, and if I could go back...
you know what? It's a little too late for that.
so what, I've lost you, too, now?
I didn't say that.
what do you mean?
well, I'm here, aren't I?
thank you. Thank you.
stop saying thank you, kristin. Honestly, I'm happy to help.
besides, it gives us a chance to catch up.
well, that's... That's kind of what I was thinking.
Hello, girls.
Hello, Rebecca. Seems like I'm running into you everywhere.
Yeah, well, I'm just helping out with the big benefit.
actually, Rebecca has a great idea for entertainment for the party.
did you know that she worked in the music industry in L.A?
no, I didn't.
I was thinking, I know a couple of young artists that might be willing to play at the benefit for just the exposure.
that's good. The kids will love that. They'll think it's dope.
what, the kids don't say that anymore?
I'm going to take that.
Rebecca Sewell.
Yes.
I'm sorry. Can you hold on a moment?
don't tell me you're not hungry.
it's just, when you said you were bringing me lunch,
I didn't realize it was going to be from the school cafeteria.
I found her.
who? - Annie Hobbs. She's here.
or at least she was. I was on my way to a meeting, and then it occurred to me that while that crappy motel doesn't have a surveillance system, the diner next door that shares the parking lot might.
fortunately, I was able to charm the 80-year-old manager into letting me access their footage.
and voil.
Oh, my god.
that's Annie.
looks like some people need to start apologizing until I tell them to stop.
well, I talked to char.
she said her dad's being totally apologetic about everything, and he even offered to buy her a pony.
couple years too late.
no, she's considering it.
God. Look who's here.
who? - Ryan Harwell.
rich, snotty, entitled. You hate him. How could you forget?
Mads Rybak. What a surprise.
I'm walking to history class, ryan. What's so surprising about that?
well, then, you've at least got to be a little surprised to see me.
you know, that is literally the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
now that you mention it, Ryan, what are you doing here?
aren't you supposed to be away at some fancy boarding school?
I was. Unfortunately, after a little more than a year, Middlebrook academy decided they no longer had anything more to offer me.
kicked you out, huh?
Yeah. I'm pretty sure it was the hammerhead shark I snuck into the water polo pool.
anyway... It's great to be back.
now I can finally ask you on that elusive second date you've been making me wait for.
Yeah, I don't see that happening.
fair enough. You got history class.
Plus, I've got the whole rest of the school year to change your mind.
geez. Can you believe that guy?
what? He was being nice.
nice? Sutton, you hate him.
remember in ninth grade, when you told everybody you saw his mom buying his jeans at gap kids?
was she? - Yeah.
well, he has definitely had a growth spurt.
maybe he's changed. Sometimes people can do that.
you, definitely.
Ryan? Highly doubtful.
Dan just left a message that he's coming back early, so we need to find another place for sutton to stay.
no argument here.
did you tell her?
no. I tried the cell phone that Thayer gave her, but she didn't answer.
you don't think she got bored and decided to do something stupid, do you?
Sutton Mercer?
no. Never.
Yeah, I was wondering if I could bring over those serving platters.
I'm on my way to a tennis lesson.
is this a good time?
great. Okay. Bye.
what are you doing home from school?
I... Was feeling sick, and I just came home to take a bath.
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have a temperature?
no. I'm actually... I'm-I'm feeling better.
let me see if you're feeling a little warm.
no, that's okay. I'm fine.
just hold still for a sec... - Don't touch me, okay?
Sutton. I don't care how sick you're feeling.
don't ever speak to me like that again.
what the hell are you doing here?
I came home to take a bath and... Some other things.
okay, this isn't just stupid; it's dangerous.
how did you even get here? - Would you relax?
it's okay. - No, it's not!
and how can you talk to Kristin that way?
she was trying to take care of you.
so now you're going to tell me how to talk to my mother?
you don't get it, do you?
you have so much and you just take it for granted.
and in fact, I...
no, please, tell me. I want to hear you say it.
you don't think I deserve any of this.
that's not what I was going to say.
look, I may take some of this for granted, but that is none of your business.
and you know what? Sooner or later this cut is going to heal.
what's your point?
well, when I take my life back, something tells me that you're hoping i'll find a way to let you stick around.
and believe it or not, it's what I want, too.
Really?
are you kidding? Emma, that would be the greatest.
Emma, are you sure this is a decaf Mocha?
because I swear I can taste caffeine in it.
Oh, yes, it's decaf. I even yelled at the barista like you told me to.
are you sure this is the safest place for you to be right now?
Yeah. Dan's at his trailer and thayer's staying with me later at the cabin, but until then, I need to...
okay, that dress is so not working for you.
excuse me? I mean, it's fine.
it's just that this dress - So much sexier.
okay, even if I wear that dress, you do realize that it still won't be you at that party?
don't remind me.
Sutton, honey, you almost ready? We're leaving soon.
be right there.
okay, I have to go. Please promise you will keep a low profile this time.
I'll do my best.
two bills for Tchaikovsky?
a little pricey, don't you think?
it's Prokofiev.
Really? Because that just sounds like a brand of vodka.
okay, I get it.
look, Mads, I know what you think of me.
you and your friend Sutton made it clear years ago.
rude, self-absorbed, irresponsible...
Yeah, but I've changed.
didn't you just get expelled for putting a shark in a swimming pool?
okay, so sometimes change can be incremental.
well... Where's the party?
hanging in there?
actually I was just thinking how I could possibly feel any worse.
and now I know. Okay, I'll see you at home.
no, no, no, no, no.
look, I know what you're going through, but running home is not going to solve anything.
so what? I'm supposed to stay here feeling like crap, putting on some big show like everything's okay?
just... See how things play out.
you might be surprised.
Hello?
damn it!
do you mind if I hide out here with you?
the weird server with the bacon-wrapped scallops just asked me to go camping with him.
sure, Ms.Sewell.
Oh, please, Laurel, don't call me that. Call me rebecca.
so are you enjoying the music?
Yeah. A couple of these guys go to my school.
I bought their album last year and played it for, like, two months nonstop.
how did you hook this up?
well, they recorded their ep at my friend's studio.
cool.
you know, I hope I'm not overstepping my bounds here, but you're quite the musical talent yourself.
how did you know that? I mean, not that I'm...
I was eavesdropping on you at your house the other day. I heard you playing.
Oh, God, I was singing, wasn't I?
Yes, and quite well, I might add.
so why hasn't someone recorded your EP, yet?
well, for one, I love music and performing - Just not in front of actual people.
disappointing to hear.
seems kind of selfish to keep all that talent to yourself, don't you think?
just saying.
I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have come here, but I was so scared, I didn't know where else to go.
it's okay, it's okay. Your head's bleeding again.
it happened when I was getting away.
did you see who broke in?
no. I thought it was laurel coming back from the party or something, but...
listen, you did the right thing, okay, but we really need to get you out of here.
Thanks. - Yeah.
okay, where are we going to go?
we'll think of someplace. Come on.
honey, what are you doing out here?
are you... Are you feeling sick again?
no, no, she's good. We're good.
I'll see you inside.
Sutton, what's going on?
have you been drinking?
no.
I want you to turn around so that I can see everything is okay.
Oh, my god.
I just fell and hit my head. Everything's fine.
in fact, I feel great.
this is a nasty cut. How did you say this happened again?
I was... walking to my car to get a lipstick, and I tripped on the curb.
could blame the heels, but it's just me being clumsy.
here, rebecca found this in the medicine cabinet.
okay.
hold still. Okay. Hold still.
there you go.
are we done?
for now, but I'm sure your dad's gonna want to take a closer look at that when we get home.
great. Well, I promise to be more careful, but right now, there's something I need to do.
thank you. - Okay.
wait, you want us to change clothes now?
Yes. What else would you do?
her parents just saw the cut.
a lot of people did.
to everybody at that party, sutton is sutton again.
and you are just... Well...
anyway, we knew it had to end, right?
so... If you don't mind, could we please just change clothes before whoever wrote that note tries to kill both of us?
okay, yeah.
Laurel. How are you doing, sweetie, are you all right?
actually, um, if it's okay, I think I'm gonna head home for the night.
I get it.
all right, can I have your attention, everyone?
okay, okay, for this next one, we're actually gonna need a little help up here.
as it turns out, my good friend, our mentor, Rebecca Sewell, has just informed me that there is someone out here who might be able to give us a hand.
now, I'm not gonna embarrass her by saying any names, but if she'd be willing to come up and join us...
what song are we playing?
do you know "what money paid for"?
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
talented kid, right? who knew?
I did, actually.
well, you're making quite an impression your first week back, then.
well, that certainly wasn't my intention.
I'm just grateful to have a chance at making a fresh start.
it's a nice song. - Yeah.
I prefer the slow ones.
Alec Rybek, are you asking me to dance with you?
500 bucks?
Ryan, I've been waiting to win these tickets all night.
so what do you want me to do, just cross it out?
actually, yes, that's exactly what I want you to do.
and deprive myself the pleasure of funding the arts?
that's kind of selfish, don't you think?
look, I know you're doing this 'cause you think it's charming or whatever, but throwing around your daddy's money isn't cute.
in fact, it just makes people feel sorry for you.
so, I checked all the windows and doors.
I know Sutton said someone broke in.
you don't think she's making it up?
at this point, who knows?
so that's it, I guess.
Sutton's got her life back.
Yeah. Kind of hard to believe.
I'm just... Me again.
and you're okay with that?
relieved, mostly.
it was fun while it lasted. Some of it.
but... But all in all, I got out with everything I needed.
you're home late.
saw you talking to ryan harwell.
something going on there?
he wishes.
exotic accent, cool car, heir to a frozen dinner empire.
I always thought you and your friends would be into that, especially sutton.
Sutton hates him and his accent.
she thinks he sounds like mary poppins.
okay, so what do you think?
so, you kind of disappeared tonight.
Yeah, sorry about that. There was kind of a situation.
Sutton told me she fell.
did you see her head?
Yeah, yeah. I think she'll be all right, though.
well, off to bed.
I almost forgot. Did you order a pizza?
no.
guy delivered one for you, said it was already paid for.
Hello?
so did you get my pizza? - I did.
so I went with cheese and ridiculously expensive ballet tickets.
cute.
look, Mads, you were right earlier.
I do come on too strong, especially when I want something.
I can be rude, immature, impatient, and sometimes I throw my father's money around, which is completely obnoxious.
anyway, the tickets are yours.
Really? What happened to loving the arts?
Yeah, that's completely untrue.
truth is, I kind of hate the arts.
anyway, it's late, so I'll let you go.
Ryan, wait. - Yeah?
well, look, the ballet is next week, and char, the person I normally go with, isn't here, so...
if you'd have any desire to go with me as friends...
that's great. We'll have an amazing time.
I'll-I'll make reservations so we can have dinner before, anywhere you want.
you did hear the "as friends" part, right?
sorry, Mads, you're-you're cutting out.
Hello?
you were great tonight, laurel.
Thanks. I was kind of nervous, but yeah.
anyway, have a good night. - Night.
Justin, what are you doing?
I would've called, but I knew you wouldn't answer.
Laurel, that girl you saw me with tonight means nothing.
and truth is, hasn't been anybody else.
great. Is that supposed to sweep me off my feet?
Justin, something amazing happened to me tonight.
I got up in front of a crowd and sang. People applauded.
I know. I was watching from inside the house.
you were amazing.
you want to do me a favor?
stop messing with me.
all these lies, the cryptic comments, all this weird crap between you and my dad.
I know. I should... Probably just tell you the truth.
probably?
Justin, you owe me the truth!
in fact, you know what?
this is it. This is your chance.
tell me what's going on or get the hell out of my life.
your dad killed my mom. Okay?
what?
she was one of his patients.
I was, uh, I was a kid.
one night, we were having dinner and she wasn't feeling well.
wound up in the E.R.
turns out, it was her appendix.
Justin, people die on the operating table all the time. That doesn't mean my dad...
no. He screwed up.
the surgery was just a routine scope. She was supposed to be fine.
but everyone in the O.R. that night said something about your dad wasn't right.
apparently, he got a call, and after that, he was, he was nervous, distracted.
afterwards, my mom was in the recovery room, and they noticed she wasn't breathing.
they tried paging your dad, but he wasn't there.
no one could find him.
turns out, he didn't stick around for the whole surgery.
left some intern to close up while he rushed off to god knows where.
still, it was an accident.
that's what they said.
he accidentally nicked the iliac artery.
but if that's the truth, then why they were so quick to settle out of court?
and, you know, by that point, my dad, he was, he was so drunk all the time, he didn't even know what he was signing.
so, wait, your-your parents didn't die in a car crash?
which means you came to phoenix to, what, get some sort of revenge on my dad?
Oh, god. It wasn't an accident that you met me in the park that day, was it?
there's so much I have to explain to you.
if you just, if you just hear me out...
No! Who are you?
is your name even Justin Miller?
I lied to you about a lot of stuff.
I didn't think I had a choice.
you always had a choice.
I know that now.
just please can I explain to you...
no. I want you to go.
before I call the cops.
Alec. - Yeah?
what are you doing?
we have a cleaning crew coming in the morning for this.
that's all right. I'm happy to help.
what?
I don't know. It's just, the Alec Rybak that I knew in high school was a lot better at making messes than cleaning them up.
Yeah, well, now it seems like I spent half my adult life cleaning up other people's messes, so...
and they say people don't change.
listen, Rebecca, there's something we need to talk about, something that's been bothering me a little bit.
Alec, what did I say earlier?
I don't want to talk about this stuff.
understood.
it's just that we both know what kind of guy I used to be, and...
I know I was reckless, and a bit of a bully.
we have two choices here.
we can keep talking about this, you apologizing and dredging up all kinds of painful memories...
or what?
or we could start fresh and see where it takes us.
doesn't that sound like a lot more fun?
how amazing was Laurel?
we always knew she had a lovely voice, but she was just so shy about performing.
Yeah, I know. Where did that come from?
now, you, young lady, you're lucky. It's not going to leave a scar.
are you sure you got that tonight?
Yeah. Why?
cause judging from the healing patterns, it looks like you've had it for a couple of days.
well, I just heal very quickly.
I saved you a piece of white velvet cake - Your favorite.
thank you. It looks great.
you gonna eat that in front of us?
or you gonna share with your father?
I don't know. You're looking a little bit thicker than I last remember.
listen to you. Coming from my daughter who looks like Rocky Balboa.
a few months ago, I discovered I had a twin sister.
and then she asked me to take her place, keep the secret, find our real mother and try to stay alive.
put yourself in my shoes.
how long could you keep up the lying game?
just let me know when you get tired of Mads.
you want to tell me where you've been?
I was at the library with Sutton.
Sutton called here three hours ago looking for you.
if you didn't want me going out with Ryan, you should have just said so.
you're the last person my mom or dad wants me dating right now.
I just don't like sneaking around.
dad, this is Sutton.
he just asked me to be in his band.
you go find Derek. - Emma...
no, Sutton's right. She needs to be the one to confront him.
the night I went into the lake, you tried to kill me.
who sent you?!
come on, let's get out of here right now.
the other was beaten to death last night.
tire iron, or some other blunt object.
you need to get out of town.
if I run, they're going to think I did it for sure.
you don't have a choice!
I was there. I can tell the cops what happened.
we can't make the switch. Get out!
no, I'm coming with you! - Just go!
so... this is where you grew up?
are you sure it's safe to hide here?
and that man is...
my father.
did you call my parents?
Yeah, they're coming.
can you go and see what's taking Larkin so long? I'll take her into the room.
come on.
so obviously, they're going to question you about the fight with Derek and Ethan, so...
is Ethan being accused of Derek's murder?
he didn't do it, Dan.
I know. I know he didn't.
have a seat.
it's true. I never believe Ethan, but this time I do.
I think he was set up, so I got him out of town.
where is he?
I don't know. I don't want to know.
but you're not to contact him, do you understand me?
you were the only one there during the altercation between Ethan and Derek.
so whatever you say right now will either help him, or put him behind bars.
so just-just tell 'em exactly what you saw.
that's it. No more. Okay?
I'm Detective Larkin. This is Officer Sanchez.
your parents are on their way.
you being a minor, you have the right to have one of them back here with you.
you're not a person of interest, but you are a potential witness to a crime.
it's up to you.
it's fine.
Sutton, I'm going to ask you a few questions, but why don't you start off by walking me through everything that happened last night.
right. Everything... that happened...
where do I begin?
we'll be interviewing all the teachers and any of your son's friends at the school.
he's one of the kids who came to my house asking about Derek.
Mrs. Rogers, are you sure? - Yes!
we're friends of Char's and Derek's.
we were just worried about him. Okay? That's why we stopped by.
Mr. Rogers...
Alec Rybak, we met once before when I was helping Derek.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Rybak.
I want you to know we're going to do everything we can to get to the bottom of this, all right?
Harry, why don't you escort Mrs. Rogers to her vehicle.
if you can think of anything, or there's anything you want to talk to me about, please give me a call.
thank you.
so... did I hear right?
you went to her house? With... - Sutton.
and Ethan, but it was only because Char wanted us to check on Derek.
you better hope to God you've got nothing to do with this.
after, yeah, it was after the fight.
why did the police officer pull you over?
we were... we were speeding.
we were going faster than the speed limit.
not according to the officer's notes.
here it says that Ethan was pulled over because of a broken left back tail light.
right, yeah, well, I thought...
he noticed it after he pulled us over for speeding.
okay. Let's go back to the fight.
did either Ethan or Derek use a weapon?
no... Ethan didn't.
what about Derek?
W... what are those... those things called?
I... sorry, I'm blanking on the...
a tire iron? - Yes! Yes...
did Derek use that against Ethan?
Yes, that's why Ethan hit him.
how many times did he hit him? Five, ten, more maybe?
one... Once. Ethan hit him once.
once?
I mean, this is really kind of exciting.
Plus, it's like we're fugitives on the run.
what's that movie, uh, where they rob a bank?
Bonnie and Clyde?
Yes. Bonnie and Clyde.
Sutton, they get shot up in a hail of bullets at the end.
it's not quicksand. Okay? Just pull your foot out.
who said four-inch heels were impractical.
well... Either you're here to introduce me to your new girl, or you're running from trouble.
I'm going to go with trouble.
this is Sutton, a friend of mine.
Yeah, I am in some trouble.
but it's not his fault.
it never is. Right, Ethan?
it looks like you could use a little help around here.
Yeah, well, I wasn't going to let you sit around here on your ass.
wash 'em down.
the girl can help.
so, where are the horse showers?
Alec, where's Sutton? I want to see her. Is she okay?
do we have to get her a lawyer?
no, no, she's all right. They're just asking her some questions.
I'd be in there right now with her if I could, but it's strictly police business.
Sutton was in her bedroom last night, studying for midterms.
at what time?
well, I don't know. She had dinner with us, then she met Mads at the library.
but no, but then she came home early, because she said Mads never showed.
Yeah, Mads was spinning some lies of her own.
she snuck out of the house last night to see a band with that Ryan guy.
she told me she was going to the library with Sutton to study, and I believed her until Sutton called the house looking for her.
did you actually see Sutton in her room last night?
Yeah, around 9: 00. I brought her a snack.
the police pulled them over just before 9: 00. That's impossible.
well, I thought that's when I went in. I don't, I don't know anymore.
well, I saw her when she got back.
and her light was on most of the night.
look, honey, it wouldn't be the first time Sutton snuck out.
guys, really, I think we're just dealing with a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Sutton, honey... You okay?
boy, that Ethan Whitehorse, huh?
what a stand-up guy, leaving her alone at a time like this.
have any idea where he is?
I'll find him.
this is just so weird, and Sutton getting arrested.
okay. What is this?
you haven't said a word since this happened.
do you think Sutton had something to do with it?
it wouldn't surprise me.
come on... I know you guys aren't exactly chums.
what's she been to you, Mads?
she went out of her way to bust you the other night with that study date ruse.
let's not forget her lying games.
can I help?
have you ever been around horses?
of course.
it's not funny! He bit my finger!
what, this guy?
Yes. - No, come on.
look at this, this is Teddy bear right here. He's all Teddy, no bear.
look, basic rule when you're dealing with horses, you want to keep your fingers away from their mouth, okay?
keep your hand flat, fingers out, like that. Want to try it again?
come on. Look, he'll be your friend for life.
okay...
see?
you love them, don't you?
horses? Yeah, I do.
I guess because with them, you always know where you stand.
all right, we're done here. Let's go inside.
or... We can go out.
I'm sure there's tons of fun stuff to do around here.
this isn't a vacation, okay?!
I'm wanted for murder right now.
I had to leave Emma back there, alone!
was Derek dead when you left the garage?
no. Derek... was alive. Ethan, he didn't kill Derek; he was defending himself.
just defending himself?
you see the way she's answering these questions? It's almost like she wasn't there at all.
but she readily admits that she was.
that could only mean one thing: that she's lying about all of it.
kid was nervous, Alec.
wouldn't you be nervous, too, if you just watched your boyfriend kill somebody in cold blood?
come on, we don't know that.
look. See that?
every time she answers a question, she looks up and to the right
when you're accessing a true memory, people look up and to the left.
lying is to the right; I don't think she's looked left once.
I don't know, I wasn't in the room.
but you were with her before Larkin got there, right?
I took her to the room, that's all.
so, theoretically, you would have had enough time to...
prep her on what to say before Larkin took over.
I mean, Dan, come on, let's face it.
you both have a vested interest in making Ethan look innocent, don't you?
lay off it, Alec - you know I wouldn't do that.
do I?
where is he, Dan? Where did he go?
I have no idea.
you better find him... and find him soon, or it's your ass, too.
so... you gonna tell me what this trouble is?
I didn't do anything.
I was set up.
you know, for a kid that never does anything, you sure get in a lot of trouble.
is... something wrong?
Where'd you get those clothes?
I found them in the guest room.
put them back.
I'm confused.
those were my mom's clothes.
Oh, God, she didn't, like, die in them...
no. She's still alive. She left when I was 13.
how did I not know this?
cause you never asked.
you have got to stop covering for that boy, Sutton.
this isn't joy rides, stolen laptops.
honey, a classmate of yours is dead.
it was a fight. Ethan didn't kill him.
char is one of my best friends.
do you honestly believe that I would watch Ethan kill her boyfriend?
okay, enough, enough for now.
but we're not through talking about this. Wait. Come here.
come here. We love you so much.
you know you can tell us anything.
I know. Good night.
G'night. - How could he do this to her?
I mean, regardless if he's guilty or innocent, leaving her like this...
I'll tell you one thing, if he ever does come back to town, he's not stepping foot in this house again, and he's certainly not seeing Sutton again.
Hey, guys. Come in.
we just wanted to check on Sutton, make sure she's okay.
well, that's nice of you, but there's no socializing for Sutton right now.
do you guys know anything about this?
no.
only what we heard at the police station.
police station. How do you know she was at the police station?
I heard my dad on the phone.
well, did you hear him say anything else?
not much. - Is she all right?
well, do you know what happened tonight? -No.
do you have any idea where Ethan is?
Hi. Sorry, I didn't want to eavesdrop on you eavesdropping, but I've been dying to talk to you all day.
are you all right? - Yeah.
no. I don't know.
did I hear Thayer out there?
Yeah, him and Mads.
mom and Dad won't let me talk to them.
Yeah. I have a feeling you're gonna be on lockdown for a while.
well, you've got me.
I know. - Do you?
it's just that... lately I feel like you've kind of been, you know, a little more distant...
I know. I'm sorry.
well, you're the strongest person I know, because if this was happening to me right now,
I'd be... crying my eyes out.
I just can't let myself.
you can with me.
so, thank you for taking me shopping.
I'll get out of these clothes and... put them back where I found them.
Hey, Ethan. I'm really sorry.
it's okay. You didn't know.
no, I-I mean for being... such a horrible girlfriend.
you know... back in the day, before Emma arrived.
it wasn't all bad. - Really?
Yeah. And... now it's my turn to apologize.
I know the shopping options on the rez are pretty limited, and you're probably used to some, like, Mega...
wait a minute. What do you think, I'm some sort of spoiled princess?
I can totally be down to earth.
do you rember the school camping trip?
I wore down and plaid and hiking boots, like everybody else.
as I recall, you also plugged the flatiron into the generator, taking out power for everybody else.
Yeah. But... do you rember what we did after the power went out?
you go ahead and take the guest bedroom.
I'm gonna sleep on the couch.
sure.
what are you up to?
I got to exercise the horses.
you okay?
I just keep going over it in my head - what happened to Derek.
I hit him. He fell.
but you didn't kill him.
I was there, Ethan.
he was breathing. He was alive.
then who did kill him?
obviously, the same person that told him to get into my car.
and who wrote the note.
well, Derek, almost told us who it was.
and they must have known that.
and they followed us up there... and they killed him.
I may never be able to go home. Do you realize that?
and I can't stay here.
Hey, where are you going? What are you doing? Let me come with you.
Sutton, look, this isn't like a pony ride at the county fair, okay?
Oh, come on. This is Teddy bear.
he's my best friend. All Teddy, no bear, right?
come on, help me out.
all right. - Well, okay.
here, give me your foot.
ready? - Yep.
you sure about this?
please. It's like riding a bicycle.
a 1, 200-pound bicycle that would crush me if it landed on me, but...
all right, let me saddle this guy up.
we'll take him up there, along the ridge, at the end of my dad's land.
it's like we're old friends, me and Teddy bear.
Teddy, Teddy, stop! Ethan!
steady!
sweetie.
you're going to school today, so you get your phone back.
but if Ethan calls you, contacts you, texts you, tweets you...
I don't think fugitives from the law tweet, Dad.
just wanted to remind you I'm still here.
I'll get it.
then are we clear? - Yeah, we're clear.
I was just at that coffee place around the corner
I was xeroxing some fliers for the show Saturday night.
thought maybe you'd need a ride to school?
the show.
what? You're not having second thoughts, are you?
no, it's not that. Come in.
you might want to see these midterm grades - they were posted this morning.
I am really taking school seriously.
Hey, Baz. What are you doing here so early?
I just, uh, printed up some fliers for the show on Saturday.
I've already told him I won't be able to go now.
Why? Because of me?
kind of. It's just, I know we have... bigger things on our minds than this.
no. Laurel, you have to.
Sutton's right; this is important.
I am going to frame this.
Yeah. - Thanks.
Sutton, do you want to ride with Baz?
no, that's okay. I'll, uh, drive myself.
but I'll meet you after school?
okay. See you. - See you.
thank you. - Bye, hon. Yep.
this is a first. - What?
look at this. Midterm grades - she got all A's?
don't you find this a little odd?
she aced her midterms the morning after she watched her boyfriend commit a murder?
think she's telling the truth, Ted.
I can't stay mad at you with all that's going on. Are you okay?
it's crazy, but... More importantly, how is Char?
do you have any idea what it's like to call one of your best friends and tell her that her boyfriend is dead?
and she's devastated that she can't come to his funeral.
Yeah, it's horrible.
I mean, the whole thing is just horrible.
you're... not involved in this, right?
no. No.
so that wasn't why you called my dad?
to have your own alibi?
wait, you mean when I was waiting for you at the library?
look, don't play dumb with me.
no. I... - What is this, another lying game?
I guess Ryan was right about you.
all right. We can break for lunch now.
take 'em out for some more riding later, unless you're too sore.
no. No.
couple of physical therapy sessions, and I should be just fine.
Hey, what's the deal with your dad?
he's so awful to you.
he blames me for my mom leaving.
a while back, I was running with a pretty bad crowd.
and on a dare, I hotwired a car, I got caught.
they sent me to juvie.
three months later, when I got out, my mom was gone.
I guess that's why she left.
we're looking for your son: Ethan Whitehorse.
and what's he done this time?
he's wanted for murder, Ben.
murder. - Yeah.
have you heard from him? Have you seen him?
I haven't seen either of my sons since they left four years ago.
not a call, not a Christmas card, and that's the way I like it.
cause I don't want any damn trouble, which is why I kicked them out in the first place.
so, you go on, search the place.
you find him, you're welcome to him.
all right. Sorry to have to bother you, Ben.
wait.
what did they say?
doesn't matter.
at the end of the week, I want you gone.
both of you.
Yeah, well, it's like what The Lennings did with "You're the...
you're The One That I Want. "Yeah. Yeah,'cause that's what I was thinking.
then we can start off with a traditional cover. Then maybe sort of end the set...
Justin... Remember Baz?
Hey, man.
we were just going over the set list for Saturday.
great. Can't wait to see it.
sweet. All right, later. Practice at Owen's tonight.
this show's gonna be boss.
boss? Is that a Baz term?
did you guys come to school together?
he thought that with everything that's going on with Sutton, that I might need a ride, so... I wasn't even supposed to be in the show.
just, my parents wanted me to.
what are those?
flyers.
I'm totally geeking out today and handing them out to everyone.
for the first time ever, I actually want people to hear me.
what?
what have you been telling Mads about me?
I've got to get to class.
okay, wait. Please?
I mean, isn't whatever happened in ninth grade, like, ancient history by now?
I don't consider what happened at the Black and White Ball ancient history.
right. Black and White Ball.
so now you're going to pretend you don't remember?
you are unbelievable, you know that?
tragedy, huh?
he didn't even make it to 18.
Yeah. You did a lot for Derek.
apparently not enough.
he did stuff for you, too, right?
I might not sure I understand what you're talking about.
I'm just saying...
I'm just saying, be careful what you accuse me of, young lady.
let me ask you a question, Sutton.
what was Derek wearing the night of the fight?
I don't know. It was dark.
well, yeah, sure, it was hard to see, and the lights were out and all.
I didn't say that the lights were out.
I mean, they were low... I think. - You think?
I'm always suspicious of someone with a selective memory.
Ethan didn't kill Derek.
you and Detective Larkin need to be looking for the car that pulled up.
Sutton... I think you've got me all wrong.
I don't think Ethan did it, either.
it's just too bad that he can't be here to share his side of the story.
you know, I'd hate to think that he's gonna be on the run for the rest of his life while the real killer gets off scot-free.
tell him that next time you talk to him.
so, Dad... ...how's business going?
we don't have to have polite conversation.
fine. All right, well, how about any conversation?
you ever hear from Mom?
no. She has a life. She left.
right, because of me.
you and I both know why she left, and if she were here right now, she'd be as disappointed in you as I am.
okay, excuse me, Mr. Whitehorse... - No, Sutton. Just forget it.
No! I... I don't get it.
don't you have to care about someone in order to be disappointed in them?
care about him?
all I ever wanted was to care about him.
well, then, what is holding you back? He's your son.
Yeah, they told me.
the cops. You're wanted for murder.
dad... I didn't do that.
all right? I didn't murder the guy.
Yeah. Right.
Ethan, you have to go out there and tell him what happened.
look, that might work in the world you come from, but not mine.
Ethan, wait! - No, no, no.
look, you've turned your whole life upside down trying to find your birth mother.
okay, you're expecting this happy ending.
well, you take it from me, Sutton, that is not gonna happen.
laurel sounds great. The whole band does.
she used to be so shy about performing, but... she's doing it.
we have great kids.
Oh, God. Justin.
I'll be civil.
Hey, Justin.
surprised you're here, considering you and Laurel broke up.
I'm just here as a friend, sir.
well, Laurel's happy now.
she moved on.
Yeah. Guess I have to accept that.
look, you don't have to tell her I was here.
Yeah, I probably won't.
how you doing?
have you heard anything?
no, my dad's been out mostly.
I talked to him at the funeral.
he doesn't think Ethan did it.
he thinks he should come back so they can catch the real murderer.
Yeah, I wouldn't fall for it.
more than likely, he's just trying to get you to tell Ethan it's safe to come back.
can I ask you something?
do you know why Mads is mad at me?
damage control used to be so much easier when Sutton would just... fill me in.
I can ask her.
I know it has something to do with Ryan and the Black and White Ball.
do you remember anything?
no, but I will find out.
Hey, Mads. - Hey.
Where's Ryan? - he's getting drinks.
so what's going on between you and Sutton?
what did she tell you?
she thought she said or did something to piss Ryan off at the Black and White Ball.
what-what are you talking about?
you know what? It's a little loud in here.
I - I thought she said something about that, but I misunderstood.
all right. I'll-I'll see ya.
did something happen between you and Sutton at the Black and White Ball?
Sutton came onto me.
I didn't want to tell you because she's your best friend.
are you sure?
trust me, she made herself very clear.
that's why I've stayed away from her.
she's bad news, and she's not your friend.
we're not friends anymore.
so this is fun. - Yeah.
what? - We took a vote, and it's time.
for what? - For your initiation.
should I be worried?
no, not if you like pancakes.
first-time band members, it's your first gig... you gotta do IHOP.
it's good, you just gotta sample every pancake from every foreign destination offered.
could I take a rain check?
there is no rain check for your first night.
this cannot be re-created, you know, the magic and the mystery, the pancakes.
you don't want to miss this.
I'll see if I can rearrange my plans.
okay.
those mariachis... - Yeah, huh?
why is it always the littlest guy with the biggest guitar?
Ding, ding, ding, ding. - Really.
that's the big guy with the mandolin.
I don't know.
what a great night, huh? - Yeah.
I should probably go.
why don't you stay?
the kids? - Yeah.
I was a little surprised about what you told them.
what?
I mean, part of me thought you were making a bigger deal out of what we have.
what do we have?
don't turn it around on me. I'm asking you.
I just don't want to label things, that's all. I don't want to...
and I don't want to cause any problems for anyone.
please. No problems. You're not... You're not.
I - I just think it's pretty simple, you know.
I knew you in high school.
turns out I really didn't know you at all.
now here we are.
it's a new us, a chance to get to know each other now.
I know one way we could do that.
nice try.
sweet note, but you could've woke me up.
I didn't have the heart to. You looked so peaceful sleeping there.
to be honest, the goal is to try to get home before the kids wake up.
you know, avoid that "walk of shame" thing, so...
shame? - It's just a turn of phrase, that's all.
so we're okay?
I think we're better than okay, yeah.
okay. So, now you know why I'm back.
do I?
well, you had to wonder why I showed up after all these years.
it's crossed my mind, yeah.
I didn't come back to get away from my ex-husband or for a fresh start, not in the traditional sense, anyway.
I - I came back for you.
well, you got me.
come in.
it's kinda crazy over at my house right now, but with all the Sutton stuff,
I think I'm flying way under the radar, so... I could probably stay for awhile.
cool.
are you mad that I went out with the band?
no.
then we're good?
Yeah.
then why does it still feel weird?
I came to hear you last night.
you did? I didn't see you.
that's 'cause you didn't have a chance.
your dad basically escorted me out after your first song.
he told me that you had moved on, and so should I.
I just want to come clean, Laurel.
have a fresh start... not pile lies on top of lies.
my parents have some very strong opinions about their daughters' boyfriends right now.
this is working.
I see you less, not more.
let's not waste any more time debating the future when we have right now.
so are you still seeing Rebecca?
Yeah.
and you're still doing this, all just to sort of keep an eye on her?
have you slept with her?
Ted, I'm a single guy. She's a single woman.
Yeah.
you know, you should smile about this.
think of it this way: Closer I get to her, the safer your secret is.
come on.
come in.
glad you came back.
starting to think what I would do if I got stuck here.
I need some time to think.
I'm sorry, I was out of line.
no, I had no right to attack your dream of finding your birth mother.
you and Emma deserve to know where you come from.
it's just hard for me to understand why.
I mean, you've got two parents that love you.
and you have a family that cares about you.
I have a father who wants nothing to do with me...
and a mother that I'm probably never going to see again. So...
you can't blame yourself for that.
she left for her own reasons, who knows what they are.
your mother didn't leave because of you, any more than...
than my mother left because of me.
Mads, please, we've have to talk about this.
what's left to talk about?
after all these weeks of blowing me off and keeping secrets, suddenly you were nice to me again, and I fell for it.
you said you'd be my alibi for the concert, and then you call my house, all innocent, and tell my Dad that I never even showed up at the library.
no, I didn't.
you've gotta go. - No, Mads, please, you got...
and Ryan told me that you came onto him at the Black and White Ball.
so what was that about? All this time you were just acting like you hated him so you could have him for yourself?
you just can't handle that a guy might pick me over you.
it wasn't me. I wouldn't do that to you.
well, if it wasn't you, who was it?
it was Sutton!
Sutton might have done those things to you, but I didn't!
what are you talking about? You are Sutton.
I... I'm... I'm not Sutton Mercer.
I am Emma Becker, her twin sister.
and then she asked me to take her place, keep the secret, find our real mother and try to stay alive.
put yourself in my shoes.
how long could you keep up the lying game?
Derek's dead. They think I did it.
we can't make the switch. - Get out!
no, I'm coming with you. - Just go!
that man is...
my father. It's true, I never believe Ethan, but this time I do.
I think he was set up.
you're the last person my mom or dad wants me dating right now, so we continue to sneak around and lie.
I came back for you. - You got me.
the closer I get to her, the safer your secret is.
Ryan told me that you came on to him at the Black and White Ball.
Sutton might have done those things to you, but I didn't.
what are you talking about?
I'm not Sutton Mercer.
I am Emma Becker, her twin sister.
this is so completely insane.
you, Sutton - the two of you twins?
and her parents and Laurel - none of them have a clue?
um, plenty of clues.
luckily, they just kind of like the new Sutton, I guess.
I wanted to tell you probably the most.
I almost did, but...
this explains so much... I think.
I mean, when I thought that you had slept with Thayer...
no, no. - No, that was Sutton.
and the secret boyfriend Ethan?
her and me - me pretending to be her.
and Ryan? - Me - her.
uh, her again - she...
she was the one that came on to him.
but this is so cool. You really are amazing, Emma.
uh, we try not to say that name aloud.
okay, so back to Ethan. Whose boyfriend is he now?
he's mine. Unfortunately Sutton is with him right now.
I have no idea where.
and she's still, like...? - Yeah.
but I trust Ethan.
what? - No, I mean, that's great.
uh, I'm just wondering if you could trust Sutton.
still don't pick up after yourself. Nothing's changed.
no, sure hasn't.
I'll tell you what.
why don't we just try to keep out of each other's way until you leave?
a week, remember?
Yeah, I remember.
thought she wasn't your girlfriend.
she was a different person back then. - And now?
now there's a side of her I don't trust.
well, trust her or not, make sure you get her an extra blanket.
it's gonna be a cold one tonight.
Hey, Sutton.
sorry. Brought you a blanket.
Thanks.
actually I was thinking you can sleep in here tonight.
I will take the couch in the living room.
I wanted to thank you for what you said, earlier, about my mom.
don't mention it.
okay. You keep the bed. I don't mind sleeping on the couch.
...thanks for the blanket.
Yeah.
what can I do for you, Alec?
straight to the point, no pleasantries. I like that, Dan.
we're investigating a murder right now, and I'm knee-deep in it, so...
don't you think you ought to be knee-deep in trying to find your fugitive brother?
he's still only a suspect.
my office thinks he's the prime suspect, Dan.
shouldn't it be in both our interests to find the real killer?
Danny, it's my strong belief that your brother is the real killer.
your top priority - your only priority - is finding Ethan.
I only take orders from the chief.
not always.
we have an arrangement.
speaking of that arrangement, I don't know, call me curious, but...
when exactly does that end?
I'm going through a tunnel, Dan.
you find your brother. Then we'll talk.
your dad has a friend.
that's Angie. She comes here every year to buy horses.
she's got a barn on the other side of the county.
hmm. She's pretty. Is there a history there?
well... she's always had a thing for my dad, and he's never been interested.
is that what you call a history?
check out that body language.
she wishes there was a history.
Oh, Mr. Whitehorse, you're so rugged and handsome.
and he'd be saying, "No offense, but are you going to buy a horse or not?"
got to go put those horses in their stalls and...
then I got to clip my toenails.
look, it's, it's not even my case, but even if it was, how could you expect me to tell you anything?
I just want to help. - Really? You want to help?
this whole thing is nothing but dead ends.
Derek's original arrest, the college kid that he was dealing to
it all goes nowhere, so what do you think that you can add to this?
I just want to tell you that that night with Ethan - it wasn't...
I know, I know. It's okay.
I know he didn't kill Derek, but it doesn't matter because Alec is all over my ass, thinking that he did.
I know he's, he's your godfather and, and your father
I understand that - but he's also the DA, therefore, my boss, and he wants Ethan home and he wants him home right now.
it's like some sort of obsession he has with it.
I know you miss Ethan, we all do, but wherever he is right now, he's safer there than here, trust me.
you didn't say anything because you think our dad may be involved.
because we don't know who we can trust.
everybody seems connected now.
so what do we do?
what about that college guy Dan said Derek was arrested with
the one he was dealing drugs to? Maybe he knows something.
okay, I'll see what I can find.
new song? Anything about me?
uh, it's a work in progress.
not quite ready for boyfriend consumption.
well, you want to take a break?
maybe later. I should really finish this song.
you sure I can't help you?
Yeah, it's not ready. I'll figure it out.
with Baz, right?
Oh, crap, Rebecca knows my parents.
if she sees us together, she might say something.
my cue to go.
Hey, Laurel. Just the girl I wanted to see.
I have some exciting news. Guess who's coming to town.
uh, Coldplay, and you've got front-row tickets?
no, better. Ray Morgan, the best producer in the business.
and guess what. He has agreed to produce a demo for you guys.
okay, what is this, Christmas? Because that sounds fantastic.
Yes, and you can even bring that cute boy you were talking to.
Justin, right?
Yeah, please don't say anything to my parents.
they can't know I'm seeing him.
a secret relationship?
no, it's not... - I love that.
I mean, maybe. It's just, it's a really long story.
okay, well, let me sit down. Let's talk about it. Tell me everything.
okay.
really appreciate the invitation, Ben.
well, I mean, I know it was probably the kids' idea.
right on the first guess.
well, I have an idea.
I think it's time for a little icebreaker.
I'm gonna ask a question, and then we all have to go around answering it.
what famous person, dead or alive, would you want to meet?
I love this one.
okay, I'll go first.
Coco Chanel. Ethan.
um, I don't know. Johnny Cash.
well chosen.
uh, as for me, Joan of Arc, 'cause nothing beats a woman with a horse and a sword.
well, maybe Mr. Whitehorse could. Ben.
I'm sorry... I'm not playing.
you all have a nice rest of the evening.
dad. Come on. You have company.
is it gonna kill you to play along for a second?
this is my house, and I'm telling you I don't feel like playing some parlor game.
and I don't do small talk. Never have.
now, if you'll excuse me.
if he would've stayed, I think he would've said Clint Eastwood.
let me get these into the kitchen.
you know, that... is the second time you've smiled today.
Oh, yeah? You keeping count?
Yeah. Looks good on you.
Rebecca is helping me produce a demo tomorrow.
just fantastic. Isn't it, Ted?
Yeah, that's great. - There's a ringing endorsement.
honey, your midterms were hardly stellar.
do you think now is the right time to be doing something like this?
okay, true, I tanked my midterms.
but that was because of the whole Justin thing.
please, Dad, this is an incredible opportunity.
at least, that's what Rebecca said.
Yeah, I'm sure she did. - I'll tell you what.
you get all your homework done, I will take you to the studio tomorrow.
Kristin! - It is an incredible opportunity, Ted.
no matter who arranged it.
Thanks, Mom. I promise to get my grades up.
dinner's in half an hour. That gives you plenty of time to start your homework!
might want to work on that poker face.
Laurel? As in... Laurel Mercer?
Yeah. I'm helping her produce a demo.
why would you do something like that?
getting that close to the Mercers?
she's a good kid, deserves a break.
I wish somebody was around to give me a break when I needed one.
you mean somebody besides me?
this is different.
tell me about it.
dinner
so, I was practicing my Grammy acceptance speech when I realized I haven't even asked you how you're doing.
have you heard anything from Ethan?
not a word.
I didn't know it was possible to worry so much about someone.
well, if there's anything I can do...
distract me by talking about anything else.
Oh. Okay. Um...
Justin. - Oh, Justin.
Yeah, he wants to see the song I'm writing, but he can't.
because it's about him?
Yeah, and it's not exactly a love song.
think Kelly Clarkson, not Taylor Swift.
can't wait to hear it.
I just... I can't stop thinking about how he started dating me with this twisted ulterior motive.
Yeah, that's a hard thing to get past.
and even though Justin says he's done with it, I'm not sure I am.
have you talked to him about any of this?
what am I supposed to say? "I just don't trust you anymore"?
I don't know.
but...
the only thing that matters is telling the people that you love how you feel.
even if it is the hardest thing in the world.
be honest.
I'm starting to think it's the only way out.
I would've bet money you would say "lie to him."
not anymore.
care to accept a little friendly advice?
probably not.
talk to him.
if you don't, you will regret it.
maybe not now... but someday.
and you know this how?
because I keep wishing that I would've talked to you.
told you that I'd found my twin.
and even after she'd taken my place, I said nothing.
I keep thinking that everything would be different if I would've just brought you in.
you're right.
it probably would have been different.
so...
maybe with your dad, there's still a chance.
Hey, sorry. I totally spaced on this dinner thing. What have we got?
Gavin Turner. That's the name of the college kid that Derek was dealing to.
his charges were dropped, as well, but he is a big deal on campus.
president of the fraternity.
and he got off. So why would he want to hurt Derek?
I don't know. I'm not even sure that he would.
but there is a coincidence here that we can't ignore.
Phi Sigma Zeta, Gavin's fraternity.
guess who's one of their most devoted alums.
Oh, my God. Dad...?!
we need to go to the fraternity and talk to this Gavin guy.
Yeah. - Why?
so our dad's an alum.
that explains why he'd let Gavin off easy, but not much else.
he's connected to Gavin and Derek 'cause helps kids in trouble.
look, Mads, I don't want to believe that Dad has anything to do with this either, but we keep finding connections.
but to say that he's involved?
we're not saying he did anything. It's...
we just have questions.
well, maybe we should be asking Dad.
I mean, why aren't we giving him an opportunity to defend himself?
Thayer, look at me. Why?
because what if we're wrong?
then he'll prove it to us.
but what we'd be accusing him of
how are we ever gonna get back from there?
listen, trust me, Mads, all I want is evidence to show that he's not involved, so that we never have to confront him.
okay. So I searched the fraternity's social calendar.
there is a party tomorrow night.
but I have no idea how we're going to get in.
please. This I know.
if there's one thing frat boys can't resist, it's girls.
girls.
listen... um...
if you want me and Sutton to leave...
I mean... I know I'm not here for Father's Day, but I'm glad we got to see each other.
even if...
just... all right.
okay, forget it. You know what, we're gonna be gone before lunch.
you never liked the water.
when you were a boy...
I used to take you down to the lake, try to get you to go in, but you wouldn't.
put up a hell of a fight, though.
then, one day, your mother took you.
she was quiet. Sweet.
you went right in. No fussing at all.
dad...
you know, my way with you, Ethan, hasn't always been right.
and I'm sorry.
for dragging you in the water.
ruing the dinner.
and chasing your mother away.
you know, all these years, I wanted to believe it was your fault she left.
it wasn't. It was mine.
I can't thank you enough for this.
I think she's got a real shot, Kristin.
she is so gifted. I don't know where she gets it.
maybe she gets it from Ted. He was always so good on that yellow Fender guitar. Remember that?
I should get going. I told Laurel I'd stay for a couple of takes;
I think I've been here for hours.
apparently, it's very uncool to have your mom come to the studio.
well, consider yourself lucky. Most kids say "Mom, drop me off around the corner."
I am lucky.
it was nice seeing you again, Rebecca. I'm gonna head home.
okay.
Hey, you know, uh, I'll follow you out.
great. That's it for today. Very nice, guys.
cool. - Sweet.
Thanks.
Hey, I'm loving this song. You keep surprising me.
surprising myself.
it's about a pretty messed-up relationship.
is that the guy before Justin?
actually, it's about Justin.
um, so, anyways, uh, I was wondering, in that last chorus, what if you went up?
Yeah, yeah, and I'll be like.
Hey, Laurel. Guess I'm early.
Justin, what are you doing?
my mom was just here. She could've seen you.
sorry. Got the Chinese.
I'll leave you to it.
I've been looking forward to this all day.
me, too.
how did things go with your dad?
as a matter of fact, pretty good.
so, thanks again.
Hey, come look.
she must really want that horse if she came back after last night.
or she's a glutton for punishment.
I don't know.
look at your dad. Is that an apology?
just wanted to say, I'm sorry for being such a jackass.
all is forgiven if you'll take me on that hayride.
again with the hayride?
well, I don't know. What do you want, skinny dipping?
Yup, that sounds good, Right after we have a proper dinner.
you don't know how long I've been waiting for you to say that.
I've wanted to say it a really long time.
I just never had the guts.
Oh, you've always had plenty of guts.
that's one of the things I love about you.
mm, careful how you throw that word around.
no fair.
I didn't know there were rules.
I say we wait for Gavin to approach us.
I'll do my flirt thing, loosen him up, get him talking. How subtle do you want this?
we don't have time for subtle. If there's nothing to this Gavin-Alec connection, then we need to get out fast and move on.
Ooh. He spotted us.
okay, smile, everyone.
Hey, guys.
you know, I never forget a face, but I, uh, seem to have forgotten all yours.
and this party's invitation only.
high school, right?
uh, 18, if that's what you're wondering.
actually, I was about to ask you to dance.
if my friends can stay.
sure.
but that one needs to learn how to smile and not bring her boyfriend along.
well, we have one foot in the door.
or at least Mads does.
you see that scrawny guy watching us?
I'm guessing a pledge.
he was at Derek's funeral.
I remember thinking, he doesn't go to school with me.
you think he knows something?
I don't know. Maybe.
look, I'm sorry. I should have been more careful.
I didn't think your mom would be here.
I didn't, either.
all this lying and sneaking around - I'm...
I'm really tired of it.
I'm a little confused.
I can't do this anymore.
it's just, I've tried.
but I'm betraying my whole family by staying with you.
but if you trust me, I don't... - I don't.
I don't, and that's just it.
Laurel, look at me.
when I look at you, I turn into something I don't like.
someone who's crazy and stupid, and I need to be honest with my family.
and with you.
so, we're breaking up?
Yeah.
that's what we're doing.
but I love you, Laurel.
I'm sorry.
you missed tamale night.
it's okay. I saved you a couple.
look, I appreciate what you're trying to do for my dad and me.
but right now, maybe it's best if we just keep our distance.
keep our distance...?
Yeah.
it's just a little overkill, don't you think?
I mean, we had a moment.
no, it wasn't a moment, okay?
it wasn't even... half a moment.
okay. Then it was a non-moment.
I got... carried away.
well, you weren't alone. I was right there next to you.
okay.
Yeah, yeah, I'm glad I called, too.
it was good to catch up. All right.
your brother says hello.
you told Dan I was here?
he's not going to say anything.
and what about Sutton? Did you mention that she...?
she never came up.
okay, good. Dan doesn't like her.
that's kind of hard to believe.
there's a part of Sutton that you don't really know.
well, she got us to talk. That's something.
looking for me?
no.
were you at Derek Rogers' funeral?
I'm sorry. I think you got the wrong person. I wasn't there.
but you know who I'm talking about, right?
look, I really can't be talking to you about this right now.
so, who told you there was weed here?
actually, there's no booze, either.
Mads? You okay?
Yeah. Fine.
okay, what is this? - We just want to talk to you.
well, you could have done that earlier in the night.
all right, it looks like you're looking for something, and it's obviously not weed.
no, we're just here to have some fun.
we - We just have some questions for you.
way too young to be cops.
actually, we're friends of Derek Rogers.
the guy you got busted with. - The guy that's now dead.
Yeah. That was unfortunate.
him dying, or you getting busted?
well, both, actually. Although, my charges were never filed.
well, the killer's still out there.
I don't know what happened to Derek, but I wasn't involved.
well, what about someone else from this palace?
you know, I'm not having fun anymore. I think you guys should leave.
listen, we just want to know if you've heard something or if you know something, all right?
no, Thayer, he's right. We should go. - No, hold on, hold on.
no, we should go. - All right, Mads, come on.
sorry.
wait. Wait. We just want to talk.
I got nothing to say.
what are you so scared of? That Gavin guy? What do you know?
I'm a pledge. Okay? I can't say anything.
you were at Derek Rogers' funeral. There has to be a reason.
did those guys do something to him? Are you covering for them?
Sutton. - No, I just want to know.
please. The wrong guy is getting accused of this.
all right.
well, you're right about Gavin. He's a total jerk.
you know, I don't even know if I want to be a member.
Why? What did he do?
after the charges were dropped, he was still buying from Derek.
but he stopped doing it in person. - He sent pledges.
Yeah, and I was there the night that Derek got killed.
you saw who did it?
Yeah. I didn't see him do it, but I saw the argument, and I told Gavin that I wanted to go to the cops, but he said I couldn't.
why not?
because... the guy I saw - I recognized him.
he's an alum from the house...
...and he's the District Attorney.
Alec Rybak. - Yeah.
this is nice.
the music or the wine?
the dance partner.
someone's popular.
would you excuse me for one minute?
okay.
one minute.
hello.
you're damn straight I'm looking for Ethan Whitehorse. What do you got?
the guy was just some kid.
a kid with a conscience that they tried to keep quiet.
but to say that my dad had anything...
I know. I know it hurts, Mads, but...
I mean, I don't want to believe it any more than you do.
we just need to find out what Rebecca might know.
if she's his alibi, then your father's off the hook.
no one can be at two places at once.
except you and Sutton.
Rebecca's gonna say that my dad was with her that night, not fighting in some garage with Derek.
I saw her with my dad at our house.
what time?
I got home around 11: 00.
I know Derek was killed before that, but...
Rebecca! - Sutton, Mads. So, shall we chat?
Yeah.
so sorry to hear about Ethan, Sutton. You must be so worried.
actually, that's why we wanted to have lunch with you.
Yeah, you know Dad's been all over this case. Finding Ethan.
Yes. He's mentioned it.
but unfortunately for you, he's pretty sure Ethan's guilty, so...
well, I'm not... we're not exactly convinced.
the night Derek died, you two had a date.
Yes.
um, dinner at his place. It was a lovely evening.
and you were there all evening, right?
Yeah.
well, that settles that.
settles what?
Hey. Hi, Sutton, Mads.
Rebecca, I need to talk to you. You got a second?
sure. - Great. She'll be right back.
excuse me.
satisfied?
not yet.
couldn't this wait? I was having lunch with your daughter.
I want you to stay away from my family. Stay away from Kristin, stay away from Laurel, and stay away from Sutton.
Ted, calm down.
no, I'm not gonna calm down.
I hope you're not operating anytime soon.
we wouldn't want a repeat of what happened to Justin Miller's mother, now, would we?
how do you know about that?
isn't that why you left L. A? - You know damn well why I left L. A!
Dr. Mercer?
is everything all right?
Yes. Yes, Tom, I'm sorry. Thank you, fine.
What're you doing? - I need to talk to Emma.
are you sure that's a good idea? I mean, your brother and Thayer, they all warned you.
I don't care.
I get it.
Ethan? I've been so worried about you.
it is insane how much I miss you.
I - I feel the same way.
how's Sutton? Where is she?
uh, she's outside.
okay, well, we're making progress on the killer.
uh, that's not true. We don't know anything.
wait a minute. Mads knows?
about me and Sutton. It's kind of a long story.
the important thing is that Alec could have...
he is not a killer.
you heard Rebecca. He has an alibi.
look, where's Sutton? She would agree that my dad would never do something like this.
guys, stop it.
Ethan, you have to get off this thing. You've been on too long already.
okay, all right, I just need to talk to her for a second.
Thayer's right, we can't risk it.
okay, I-I...
I love you.
I've been trying your cell. I called the club.
Tom said you had words with Rebecca?
Oh, it's not even worth talking about.
well, I want to talk about it.
Kristin, please. - No. I'm tired of being lied to.
I'm not lying. - That is a lie.
What're you talking about? What lie? What am I doing?
I want to know what's going on with you and Rebecca.
you change every time her name comes up.
and when the two of you are in a room together, it gets strange.
Kristin, okay, please. We're not having this discussion. Okay?
nothing is going on.
how's your filet?
cooked to perfection.
you're really spoiling me, Alec.
that is my intention.
Hey, Mads told me you guys had lunch at the club today, is that right?
mm, yeah, Sutton and Mads. - Oh, yeah?
Yeah. It was delightful, albeit a little strange.
delightfully strange? - Yeah.
how so?
well, they were asking me a lot of questions about you, and the night that Derek was killed.
so, I told them that we were at dinner at your house all night, and...
you know, which is the true, of course. - That's truth.
Yeah.
listen, they're just kids. They're curious.
they were all good friends with Derek. I'm not surprised.
you know what? This may be the best cut I ever had.
Ted came by, too.
he got a... a little emotional.
Really? - Yeah.
I think you're teasing him. Just a little bit.
and I think you like it.
I don't do that kind of thing, Alec.
you should know that by now. It's not in my nature.
Yeah.
aren't you gonna ask how it went with Emma?
I'm sure it was perfect.
actually, you were right. I shouldn't have called.
there was a lot going on over there. They're deep into this thing.
well, she loves you. She'll do anything for you.
you do that a lot.
what? My hair flip?
flashes of honesty.
sometimes the truth scares me.
you? Scared?
I don't believe it.
it's a whole other kind of risk.
putting yourself out there.
like you opening up to your dad, your dad opening up to you.
I'm glad I did it. It was worth the risk.
you should try it sometime.
okay.
well...
I love you, Ethan. I always have.
and I know I screwed up, and there's no going back.
but I think that's why I fought so hard.
okay, I like the way this feels.
not really the blush, but...
it's probably the fire. I'm doing it, too.
you are.
Yes, he has an alibi, but you know I've had these suspicions forever.
Yeah, but what reason would Rebecca have to lie?
because she's in love with him.
I love my dad, and I think he's capable of a lot of things, but not murder.
I'm just trying to prove his innocence.
and you're trying to prove his guilt.
we both just want the truth.
Oh, God, this is so frustrating.
I thought talking to Ethan would make me feel better, but it just made me feel worse.
he was just so weird... about all of it.
and where was Sutton?
I don't know.
whatever happens...
I'll be there for you.
you're a really good friend.
FBI! Freeze! Hands up!
turn around and drop to your knees now!
are you Ethan Whitehorse? - Yes, sir.
are you alone in the house? - Yes, sir.
Ethan Whitehorse, you're under arrest for the murder of Derek Rogers.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
a few months ago, I discovered I had a twin sister.
and then she she asked me to take her place, keep the secret, find our real mother and try to stay alive.
put yourself in my shoes.
how long could you keep up the lying game?
you keep surprising me.
Hey, Laurel.
I'm betraying my whole family by staying with you.
so we're breaking up? - Yeah.
Yeah, I was there the night that Derek got killed.
the guy I saw, he's the District Attorney.
the night Derek died, you two had a date.
and you were there all evening? - Yeah.
I want to know what's going on with you and Rebecca.
nothing is going on.
I want you to stay away from my family. Stay away from Sutton!
Sutton is with Ethan right now. No idea where.
but I trust Ethan. - I'm just wondering if you can trust Sutton.
I love you. I always have.
FBI! Freeze!
Ethan Whitehorse, you're under arrest for the murder of Derek Rogers.
Ethan, we're going to get you out, I promise.
I love you.
so do you have an attorney, son?
no. I want to call Sutton Mercer.
could I have a minute with him, please?
come on, you know it's against regulation.
Yes, I know that, but he's a minor, and I'm his guardian.
two minutes.
don't worry. We're going to get you through this, all right?
Thanks, man. - Just be careful, keep your head down, and watch that temper.
how's Sutton holding up?
actually, Ethan, I had her all wrong. She's been a rock.
we're going to ask for a juvenile waiver, so we can try the suspect as an adult.
crimes don't come any more grown-up than murder.
there's no reason to put on kid gloves now.
I'll take a couple of questions. Chris, what do you got?
will you be handling this case yourself?
Oh, that's a big no can do.
I don't think it's any secret that the victim who...
died so senselessly was a friend of mine.
because of this relationship, I'll have to recuse myself from the trial.
however, my office will continue to make this a top priority.
we will not rest until justice is served.
what kind of bail will you ask for?
bail? I have a problem with bail on this one, seeing as how the suspect's already run once.
what do they say?
fool me twice, shame on me?
all right, guys. Thanks for your time.
okay, people are staring at me.
it's probably that "A" you got on your history final.
or, you know, the fact that your boyfriend just got arrested for murder.
Ethan... - It's definitely one of the two.
did not kill anyone. It was all a misunderstanding.
Hey, I know that.
but good luck convincing Mom and Dad. They're in "concerned parent" overdrive.
I'll try to cover for you, but no promises.
Hey.
I saw you talking with your sister. Is she doing okay?
I think so. Um...Thanks for asking.
what about you?
I know it's always a drag after a breakup.
I'm okay. Mercer girls are tough.
well, hey, listen, if you feel like clearing your head or anything, we're gonna be working on a couple new songs later.
Yeah, I don't know if now is, like, such a great time.
it's just that we just got some really amazing news today.
so share. - That demo that we sent out...
well, some people at Coachella really dug it, and they want us to play at the festival.
wait, we're playing Coachella?
I mean, technically, we'd be alternates.
at the Oasis Dome, which is, like, the smallest venue there, and of course we could get bumped if, like, Modest Mouse shows up.
Oh, my God, Baz! No, that is amazing!
I have an uncle in Palm Springs who said that we could stay with him.
he can call your parents... - Damn it. No.
who am I kidding?
no, they would never let me go. Especially now.
they're not exactly in a permissive mood.
but just think about it, okay?Cause this a mad cool opportunity.
you deserve it.
so... brace yourself.
I just talked to Thayer.
he's on his way to get Sutton and bring her back from the ranch.
Oh. Great timing.
Yeah. I'm not thrilled, either.
sorry, I don't mean to be petty
it's just that this separation has been so hard, and it's the longest Ethan and I have been apart since we met.
and then to know that she was there, with him...
well, maybe she's changed.
Yes, I realized how ridiculous that sounded the second I said it.
Hey, it'sherlife.
I'm not surprised that she wants it back.
Hey, thank you for the coffee. It really hits the spot.
it was already made.
well, I appreciate it.
it's a beautiful country out here.
compared to what?
well, it's just nice, that's all.
I took some pictures to rember our visit.
here, take a look.
I watched my son dragged off in handcuffs. For murder.
I think I'll rember the visit.
I will just get my stuff, then. - Yeah.
listen, I don't know what you've heard or imagined, but Ethan's innocent.
let me ask you something.
does an innocent man run?
well, he had no choice; he was going to be framed.
I taught him to stand and fight his battles.
this time, he ran.
maybe I don't know my son at all.
or maybe I'm as naive as his girlfriend out there.
girlfriend?
are you talking about Sutton?
that's... that's not his girlfriend.
well, I'm not as naive as you.
I left the bedding in the laundry shed.
everything okay?
better get on the road...
if you want to beat traffic.
okay...
thank you.
wait.
tell Ethan to... be strong.
and, when he gets through this, he's welcome here.
tell him to come back.
you, too.
too bad you're a little late.
you just missed a hell of a show.
target practice? Really?
the chief prefers we practice on our own time rather than on the job.
I thought you'd maybe be doing something a little bit more important, like...
I don't know, finding your brother an attorney?
I'm not careful, I could be looking for one myself.
I told Ethan to skip town; I gave him money to do it.
well, you were protecting your brother.
or aiding and abetting a fugitive from justice.
it's one of those, uh...tomato-tomahto things.
you can't give up on him now. He needs you.
he has a court-appointed attorney. I don't know what else I can do for him.
I have seen those court-appointed attorneys in action.
they barely read the case, and half the time, they just tell their client to take a plea bargain just so they can lessen their workload.
how do you know so much about that?
I...
look, Mads told me that Alec assigned his star prosecutor to this case.
Ethan needs a legal genius to beat these charges.
well, legal geniuses don't work for free.
and I just checked under my couch cushions, and...
I happen to be a little light.
unless Ted and Kristin are gonna pony up for a retainer.
God, this is so unfair.
you got that right.
look...
there might be one person I can call.
Hey, can you hand me the lug wrench?
you know I have no idea what that is.
that thing right there.
here.
so, anyway, Emma freaked when Mads told her about what my dad said.
that they've assigned Ethan's case to this pit bull.
Emma's working on finding a better defense attorney.
I mean, they could've just given him a court-appointed lawyer, but Emma said that she's seen these people work in foster care trials, and they can be super lame.
Emma said that sometimes, it depends on who... - And eleven.
what?
Oh, I was just counting the amount of times you began a sentence with "Emma.
you hit double digits.
why don't you just give her a break?
all she's tried to do is help.
Oh, 'cause that's what she does, is it?
just helps everybody?
you seem to have gotten pretty cozy with her.
the minute Ethan left town.
sorry. I...
I'm just in a weird mood. - Are you?
just, up at the ranch, you're just so far away, and you reexamine everything in your life...
I don't know. It's just kind of hard to go back.
Oh. Really?
so what exactly happened?
why, did Ethan say anything?
no. I mean, it's not like we could talk to him, but... you know.
Yeah. No. I-I shouldn't...say anything.
well, no, it's fine, you can.
I mean, if you want to. - Well, it's just...
you know, when you're away from all the BS, you...
I just saw a side of Ethan that I don't think any of us have ever seen.
what is this, casual Fridays at the Scottsdale PD? - No.
it happens to be my day off, and I thought that you might like this look.
it brings out my rugged yet soulful masculinity, yeah?
I think you look good in just about anything.
always bugged the crap out of me.
you don't look so awful yourself.
I, uh...
I really appreciate you coming down here.
well, I figured it must be pretty important for you to pick up the phone and call me for the first time in what, seven years?
seven years, five months, and roughly, a couple of weeks, but...
who's counting, right?
right. So tell me, why does Alec Rybak's prot- slash-whipping boy find himself in the need of an A-list defense attorney?
Alec is actually part of the problem here.
Alec? I'm stunned.
gosh, here we go with the lecture again. - No, I mean, if only someone would have warned you to break away from him when you graduated the academy with that superhot girlfriend.
whatever happened to her, anyway?
she got even hotter.
all right, here's the deal.
I assume that you're familiar with the Derek Rogers murder?
Yeah, the high school kid;drug dealer.
sounds like they caught the killer.
some classmate, right?
they got the wrong guy.
and Alec is trying to railroad the thing through.
he's trying to get a quick conviction, looking tough on crime.
never mind that an innocent kid is going down.
innocent kids go down all the time, Dan.
system's not perfect.
wh-why is this one so important?
this kid's my brother.
not... Ethan?
only one I got.
Oh, my God, the last time I saw him, he was...
he was in Little League.
well, he's in the big leagues now, that's for damn sure.
explain to me why I have to stay here, again.
Oh, come on, it's not that bad.
it's just until we find a good time to make that switch with Emma.
Mads. Hey.
there's, uh, extra blankets in the other room.
well, you two catch up.
Sutton, try to get some rest, okay?
how's school?
and there's food and soda in the fridge.
okay, you're obviously mad at me, so let's just have it out.
is this because of the Ryan thing?
if you're asking me, am I still mad at you for hitting on him, yeah, still am.
Oh, come on, I was doing you a favor-vetting him, he passed, so... moving on.
is this because I didn't tell you I had a twin?
do you seriously have to ask me that?
I was going to tell you eventually.
I was just waiting for the right moment.
how about any of those hundreds of moments when I was feeling like a fool for not understanding why my best friend was shutting me out?
I said I was sorry.
you did? When?
cause I must have missed it.
and you know what I feel really bad about?
the times that I got mad at stuff that you did and I ended up taking it out on Emma, who's been nothing but kind to me since I've known her.
which has been what, like, a few weeks?
well, long enough to know that Emma's a friend for life, which might be more than I can say for you.
Sutton! Where have you been?
we've been starting to worry.
I thought you'd be in bed.
as I told them they should be, since you were probably at the library.
I was at the jail trying to see Ethan.
see, now, that I wouldn't have guessed.
well, I can't say that I'm surprised.
I saw you on TV this morning; a lot of folks did.
I was just trying to support him.
he's totally alone.
do you have any idea what it's like to be dragged in there in handcuffs in front of all those news cameras?
well, having never been arrested for murder, - no, I can't say that I do. - Ted.
okay, well, none of my friends think that Ethan could've murdered someone.
Laurel, honey, I think it's time for you to turn in
this is between Sutton and us. - Okay.
love you, sis. Hang in there. - Thanks.
good night. - Good night.
okay, I think the one thing we can all agree on is, - the trial could be all-consuming. - And very public.
everyone will be watching this.
I think we need to come up with some ground rules that we can all agree...
Yeah, like not hanging around the city jail half the night, huh?
Sutton, we're just trying to protect you.
the police have already brought you in for questioning.
I think maybe you do need to distance yourself.
I know you don't like him.
this isn't a question of us disapproving of a boyfriend. - It's not about that...
he is a murder suspect!
then isn't he entitled to a fair trial?
people are innocent until proven guilty.
Sutton, listen to me...
no, I'm sorry, I just, I need to go to bed.
Oh, what, so now this is my fault?
I was trying to reason with her like an adult, - you kept interrupting and lashing out! - She's not an adult. That's the point.
you are the one that is gonna drive her away!
Oh, is that so? Okay.
is that so?
so I just can't seem to do anything right around here, then, huh?
that is not what I am saying. - Well, that's what it feels like.
you know that? You're second-guessing me left and right.
I mean, sometimes it feels like I'm the one on trial!
so, when you and Thayer arrived at the body shop...
no. Sutton. Thayer wasn't there.
are you sure? I could've sworn that I saw Thayer's name.
okay. So Thayer was with you when you went to Derek's house.
Thayer, house, Sutton, body shop. T- H-S-B-S.
I'll just, I'll come up with a mnemonic or something.
now, how long have you and Mr. Rogers been acquainted?
Theresa Lopez.
I don't believe it.
I'll be taking your case now.
I beg your pardon?
who do you think that I am, then?
the guy my client was just about to fire.
so, often they'll wait a few days before the arraignment so that the suspect can get an idea of what prison would be like.
that's awful. - Yeah, but it works.
especially if the kid is nervous and scared;
by the time he gets in front of the judge he's ready to cop a plea.
that's not Ethan. - Well, good, because that's not me, either.
listen, I'm sure you don't hear this often, but we should probably wrap this up, or your crack legal team here is gonna miss first period.
all right, look, I've been over the evidence - their case is weak.
they don't have a murder weapon, and it's hard to get a conviction without one.
okay, so what should we all be doing?
well, right now I'm looking at Ethan as a person of interest, so we need to think of other persons of interest.
who else would've wanted this kid dead?
not this again.
Mads, you think this is easy for me?
I hate this. - Then don't do it.
Hey, come on, now, don't keep things from me. I'm on your side here.
there was this... frat guy.
he went to buy weed from Derek that night and... saw someone there.
in silhouette, from a distance, and it was dark.
apparently it wasn't that dark.
we tracked the guy down at this frat house party and asked him about that night.
once again, the night that he was out buying drugs.
Yeah, so what if he was, Mads?
he definitely saw who was there.
he was a hundred percent certain. - That's huge!
that's great! - I'm not so sure.
the guy he saw was Alec Rybak.
it was just, like, one minute we were all working on the case together, and then the second I mentioned his name, she just lost all of her confidence and got scared.
she said that it was too dangerous and that we should back off.
okay, because of Alec?
tell me you're joking.
you know, we shouldn't even be talking about this.
s - Sutton, he is... family.
in fact, I think Mom and Dad even signed some guardianship agreement that, like, they get killed in a car crash, Alec would raise us.
and now, what, you think he killed Derek?
I mean, that's just kind of insane.
I'm just telling you what she said.
she said, "Let this go. I know this guy. Be very, very careful.
Oh, looks like I'm not the only one with some mystery in my life.
no, it's just a joke.
a joke that made you blush. - Stop. You were talking about Alec.
are you gonna confront him or what?
no, not directly.
I already tried, and it didn't really work.
but I may have a way in.
I went to the frat, and I talked to that kid and I heard his story, and I know that he isn't lying.
but how, how do you know?
I mean, for all we know, this kid could be brought up on charges and trying to lessen his sentence by making outlandish claims.
I just feel it in my gut. And the truth is, I...
never mind. It's... nothing.
I'm not gonna say anything to anyone, and I want you to feel safe saying what's on your mind.
there's just something about Alec that I don't trust.
I get this feeling when I'm around him, and I've had it for a while now.
but is it enough?
you come out in the open with this, you could ruin his reputation, his career.
you could destroy his life.
and what about Ethan's life? Does nobody care what happens to him?
you really love this Ethan, huh?
more than anything in the whole world.
I'm gonna help you, Sutton.
Alec - leave him to me.
I promise it'll work out.
you'll see.
obviously, you two didn't get the note that this is a very bad idea.
what, potentially implicating my father in a murder charge?
trust me, I know what a bad idea it is.
here's my dad's cell phone records for the last two months.
23 calls to Derek, seven from him.
there's also a written description from Jesse, the frat guy, about what my dad was wearing that night.
it matches.
what, no surveillance videos?
I'm gonna be honest.
if I would've known that the only way to get this guy off is to somehow bring down the district attorney,
I might have run the other way from this case.
maybe Ethan needs a better lawyer, then.
there isn't one. But we're dealing with a powerful guy here, and if he finds out that I'm snooping around his personal life with his own kids?
this could get ugly.
we're not backing down until Ethan's set free.
Sutton, do you have a sec? I - I have a message for you.
Ethan wanted me to tell you that he's okay, and that he's counting down the minutes until he sees you.
God, it's unbearable.
I know exactly how you feel.
I don't think you do.
trust me. I used to call him Danny back then.
you're not the first girl to fall under the Whitehorse spell.
if I could just see him...
for, like, a minute.
let me see what I can do.
delicious, hon.
you've really outdone yourself. - It's really good.
I wish Sutton were here. She loves salmon.
I think she said something about a... tennis meeting, that it might run late.
I think I can guess where she is.
Ted, please, let's not... - Oh, like it's a secret.
we all saw her throwing herself at the kid on the news.
