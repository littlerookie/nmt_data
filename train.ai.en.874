I--I mean yes,
I do want you to have safe sex, but, no, I don't want you to have sex at all.
I'd much rather you wait till you know you're ready, till you and Andy know you're ready.
it'll mean a whole lot more if you do.
but if you decide to ignore everything I say and make you own monumentally life-altering no-going-back decision to have sex, forever changing the relationship you have with Andy, then I want you to be protected.
can I go now?
Yes.
whoa. Hold up.
a little screwy loop here.
okay.
good to go.
Thanks, dad. - You're welcome.
Hey, handsome.
so how was the talk, part two?
well, a little like that condom I just gave our son.
clumsy, awkward, but hopefully effective.
are you sure you're okay with missing your dinner to help with my plan?
do you think for one minute that Lori Trager would let us miss an opportunity to help you and Amanda?
we're skipping the pre-prom dinner?
sweet!
you were paying for that part, weren't you?
I was indeed.
what's taking them so long?
I've been gorgeous for hours already.
let's go, people!
we have a prom to save!
you are ruining our entrance.
Lori, you look-- - yeah, yeah.
what you are about to experience is a defining moment in your otherwise idiotic life.
do not mess it up.
looking good, Trager.
not bad yourself, Mcdonough.
where's.
all my research had been right.
no matter what anyone said about expectations, everyone secretly hoped this would be the best night of their lives.
Oh, my god!
I knew that more than just helping Amanda, my night had just become about making sure everyone got their wish.
you did that on purpose.
maybe.
Wow.
Really? - Yeah.
Jessi helped me.
you did?
well, I didn't want to, but she was really pathetic.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
okay. Good to know a little girl-bonding didn't upset the balance of nature.
what time is it? - Relax. We're here early.
Kyle's waiting for you in the gym.
you've gone soft.
I had a near-death experience.
it's gonna take me a few days to return to normal.
Hi.
Hi.
it's perfect.
I had a little help.
heel, toe, heel, clap, clap.
heel, toe, heel, clap, clap.
I think the problem is I have two left feet.
I never noticed.
how do you buy shoes?
it's an expression.
but you knew that, didn't you?
those jewels aren't real, you know!
whatever, Hillary!
don't drink that.
someone spiked the punch.
that's impossible.
according to my research, it happens at 68% of all proms.
I have to take care of this.
and something's leaking by the DJ table.
there's water everywhere.
I'm on it.
Where's Declan?
hopefully not looking for me.
Where's Andy?
I, uh, ditched her on the dance floor.
a man needs a break, you know?
why are you both hiding from your dates?
you want this one?
he's hiding because he's freaking out about whether or not to have sex with Andy.
she wants this.
I mean, I can't blame her.
eww.
but she's so much more experienced than I am.
so, yeah, I'm totally freaking out.
right.
your turn.
she's messed up because she doesn't know whether or not to get back together with declan.
Yep.
prom is stressful.
true that.
it doesn't have to be.
are you kidding?
you've been flipping out all week.
I know.
but Nicole taught me something.
you're busting out a mom moment right now?
she said that tonight is a celebration of how far we've come, and we should just let it happen and enjoy it.
I have come a long way.
from dumb to dumber.
better than a slut to sluttier.
that's the old me. - Oh.
which means I have come a long way.
that Nicole Trager, she's pretty good.
Yes, she is.
you're not so bad yourself.
shall we?
okay.
all right.
tell me the truth.
about what?
we lost the song contest, didn't we?
we lost the song contest.
well, that's just.
fine, actually.
is it? - Yeah.
I didn't write that song for this.
I wrote it because I had something to say about myself and everyone here tonight.
well, no one's heard it except me.
the perils of the undiscovered songwriting duo.
destined for a lonely life on the road.
with only their college degrees to keep them warm at night.
phds, please.
you have a phd? - No, not yet.
how old do you think I am?
how old are you?
I'm 19.
you're only 19?
I was--I was sort of an early bloomer, academically speaking.
and you've been torturing me about being so young.
you are unbelievable.
but I'm half of a pretty great songwriting duo.
I don't know about great.
you heard the song.
but have you?
Hello, everyone.
hello.
I hope you're all having a great night.
this song is not the winner of the prom theme contest.
but I though that everybody should get a chance to hear this song.
it's written by someone who, in my opinion, knows a whole lot more about who she is and really what life's all about than she will ever admit.
so, enjoy it.
this isn't-- how.
I'm a computer genius, remember?
what are you doing up here?
roof leak.
what about you? I thought you went home hours ago.
what do they call it?
a last hurrah?
a last hurrah?
you're leaving with Sarah tonight.
Yeah.
you're not gonna ask her to stay?
Amanda said something to me earlier.
if you care about someone, you wanna put their feelings first.
I wanna do that for Sarah.
I understand.
I guess I just wish she'd done the same for you.
thank you for your help tonight.
it's amazing what we can accomplish when we work together, isn't it?
I'm gonna miss you, Jessi.
no, you're not.
because no matter where I am, we're always connected.
that's true.
even if I am smarter.
stronger. - Faster.
you, uh.
you better get back in there and make some more memories.
they're kinda hard to come by for people like you and me.
you should come down, too.
a last hurrah.
a last hurrah.
you've been following me.
nice tux.
why all the secrecy?
I didn't want to distract you.
you're worried about Latnok, aren't you?
you don't trust them either.
well, they're scientists.
I don't know if they should be trusted.
do I have anything to worry about?
you should always worry.
not tonight.
tonight is about Amanda.
we'll be fine.
okay.
I'll go.
but, Foss.
thanks for looking out for me.
God, I love a man in a tux.
me, too.
I mean, I like being the man you love in a tux.
okay, so we've had our pictures taken.
we've danced.
we've eaten weird french hors d'oeuvrey things.
we've covered every prom clich? In the book, and now I think we should move onto our end of the night festivities.
okay.
let me begin by saying you're the hottest girl I know, and I fantasize about having sex with you, like, all the time.
and I really wanted to have sex with you tonight.
but then my dad comes up to me and didn't make any sense about whatever he was trying to say and wanted to give me a condom, and it all became real.
and anyway, I just don't think we should.
you think I wanted to give it up to you tonight?
didn't you?
losing my virginity on prom night is the most clich of all things clich?
what kind of sentimental loser do you think I am?
wait. You're a virgin?
why wouldn't I be?
so what did you mean then, if not sex?
triple chocolate sundaes and me kicking your ass yet again in G - FORCE extreme.
Really?
really.
there you are.
I'm finally done putting out fires.
I'm assuming there were no actual fires.
no, no fires.
a flood or two.
I guess there was more than one leak.
the cleaning crew will get it.
I think it's time for a dance.
I think that sounds great.
have a great night, everyone.
the prom as we know it has ended.
it's over.
it doesn't have to be.
may I have this dance?
gotta go, pumpkins. I got a tiara to stalk.
good night.
later, Hills.
so what's next on our Hillary approved itinerary?
how'd you know?
cause she had that glint of a job well done in her eyes.
I didn't want to mess anything up.
how could you think you could mess it up?
cause I feel like that's all I've ever done since the first time we got together.
I couldn't even break up with you properly.
we're so passed that.
look, I know I said I'd be more open and all that, so let me do this.
right. Sorry.
continue with your openness.
I really like you, Lori.
I always have.
I don't know where you stand with me or with what we're supposed to be or not be, but I want you to know that it's in your hands.
it's in my hands? Why?
cause I heard your song tonight.
really heard it.
the girl who wrote it has got her whole future in front of her.
I don't wanna be the one that holds her back.
you know what's amazing?
is you really know me, and you get me.
I care about you so much.
but you're right.
I don't wanna move backwards.
or even stay in the same place.
so.
I think that means that we shouldn't be together.
is that okay?
I seem to remember it's part of the whole "it's in your hands" thing.
do you mean it?
Trager, you're one of my best friends.
all I want is for you to be happy.
I don't know if I deserve that.
trust me, you do.
you did that, didn't you?
maybe.
so how do you do it all?
do what?
everything I've seen you do.
my brain is more developed than other people's.
it allows me to do special things.
kinda like superman, only real?
can you fly?
I'm not gonna tell you that until you tell me something I don't know about you.
not this again. - It's only fair.
you may not know that.
I love you.
you do?
I do.
I love you, too.
Oops.
here, don't get your feet wet.
there's a reason why people say we shouldn't expect too much.
no one wants to see someone they care about end up disappointed.
we instinctively act to protect our own from being hurt and do what we can to make the right choices for the people we love.
but the reason we have expectations in the first place is because we wanna aim as high as we can.
because when you love someone, there's no limit to what you can accomplish.
Oh!
I left my other clothes inside.
I'll get them. - No, I will.
no, let me help you.
again. - Always.
got everything you need?
I do now.
the thought of you two living together.
it's not like that.
she needs a place to live,a family.
I know, but.
Amanda,you're the onlyone for me.
I never caught your name.
I'm Cassidy.
I've counseled a lot ofteenagers over the years.
I have never given upon any of them.
I'm not giving up on you.
I heard you've been spending time with Lori Trager.
we're just hanging out.
not anymore.
there you are.
I don't know how to say this.
mark told me he won't date me because he's afraidfor his future.
good. He should be.
why do you get to decide who I can go out with?
because I'm your father and you live in my house.
I thought you'd be with Andi.
her mom extended their vacation rental another 3 weeks.
I just really miss her.
with Kyle I'm just a sidekick.
but out here I'd sink 'em half the time with my eyes closed.
what did you do to Amanda?
you put something in her head.
we might be able to disintegrate it.
you've done enough.
Kyle, that's it.
pass the electricity througha kiss.
you'll have to practice.
are you ready?
just try to be gentle.
Amanda, let me explain.
you are always trying to explain.
but there is no explanation for why you were kissing Jessi!
I can feel what's happening between you two.
but I can't be with you when I know I'm losing you to someone else.
you can never lose me.
I already have.
the call it heartache,a hurt so profound it becomes hard to breathe.
I had never felt it before,and I wondered,will it ever go away?
Kyle, I know you're hurting over Amanda.
but you have to stop obsessing.
and I have just the distraction.
the allure of a new woman.
see?
many new women.
two dimensional, yes ,but still satisfying.
it's a safe, easy escape with someone you love.
you!
let music be your relief, your way out.
you're wallowing in sorrow, you're depressed.
you're pining.
you need a minor.
come on,now.
with more feeling.
commit.
great.
you're not the first guy to get dumped.
think of it as a rite of passage.
mine was tenth grade, Beth Ann Johnson.
beautiful, adventurous, a gymnast.
deadly.
stick with me, now.
OK.
I'm ready.
what are you doing?
wiping Amanda from Kyle's memory.
could you give us a minute?
but I'm all charged up.
Jessi, please.
fine.
I'll just go zap someone else, then.
I'm kidding.
she is kidding, right?
OK, Kyle, what you're going through takes time.
but it will take even longer the more you lay around her eand feel sorry for yourself.
it's time to get up, or man up, whatever the phrase is these days.
man up?
out of the tub.
now.
either that or fill it with soapand water because you stink.
come on.
we should go.
sit.
I thought Amanda didn't work on fridays.
you know her schedule?
that's so co-dependent.
I've been reading some of Nicole's books.
like it or not, you're gonna see her.
she lives next door, so get used to it.
if you want my advice.
we don't.
OK.
I can't believe he came in here with her.
who?
please.
I saw your jaw clinch.
by the way, don't grind or you'll get really bad TMJ and have to eat creamed spinach the rest of your life.
do they look like a couple?
Pumpkin,don't torture yourself.
just look over there and tell me.
I see a decided lack of chemistry.
nothing like Whatky-Manda exuded.
she just looked over here.
she did?
don't look back.
she'll see you.
where should I look?
anywhere.
here, look at me.
Yeah.
Yeah, look deep Intotrager's eyes.
that's not weird.
Kyle, look at me.
I don't think that's a good idea.
as a matter of fact, maybe you shouldn't be sitting next to me.
maybe I should just sit at another table.
I'll make it easier for you.
Jessi, wait.
feeling better?
are you using your car?
what?
I couldn't hear you.
could I borrow your car, please?
for?
I want to go out.
where to?
I'm not sure.
what, you just gonna drive around aimlessly?
can I borrow your car or not?
Josh has it.
Josh has the car?
Josh has a car.
radiator's busted so he took mine.
you couldn't just say that?
Oh, and be straight with you?
like you were when you went to see Mark?
passive-aggressive doesn't really suit you.
you lied to me, Lori.
you gave me a good reason to.
Jessi, is that you?
come on in.
I was just looking at these colors.
any preferences?
for the walls.
any preferences?
um, not really.
any color's fine.
Well,it's gonna be your room.
I want you to feel comfortable.
something bothering you?
no.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't.
why are you sorry?
habit.
being in this room, I guess, trying to get people to open up.
just know you can talk to me whenever you want to.
in this room or not in this room.
yeah?
I feel.
that daughter of yours!
Hey, Jessi.
um, this green's fine.
I should talk to her.
bad idea.
I could explain.
what?
why you kissed another girl?
right in front of her?
you can't take that back.
you're finished, Kyle.
it's over.
way to lift his spirits, dude.
come on.
we're getting out of here.
where are we going?
I've got just the cure.
good magazine?
if by good you meant rashy and trivial and completely devoid of journalistic value, then yes, it's fantastic.
I'll leave you alone.
wait.
you don't have to.
it's not you.
who is it?
my father.
he's unbelievable.
he's got this bug up his ass about Mark.
a bug?
he's pulling this big power trip on me.
and now I am stuck here, carless with no place to go.
I wish I had a place of my own.
I do.
the apartment.
I still have the keys.
what are we waiting for?
there's really nothing to do there.
it doesn't matter.
it's not here.
are you coming?
is this spot ok?
it's fine.
I parked here a million times.
where are we?
Kyle, my friend, we're at a Seattle landmark.
little-known watering hole, tradition passed on from generation to generation of teenagers.
what is it?
a bar that doesn't check IDs.
isn't that illegal?
tonight isn't about technicalities.
it's about letting loose, it's about seeing how much fun life can be post-Amanda.
so, why are we at a bar?
you don't even have cable?
I told you, there's nothing to do here.
Hi, Jessi.
how are you?
how are you doing?
what are you two ladies up to this evening?
what did you have in mind?
I was gonna go meet a friendf or coffee.
any suggestions?
try the rack.
God, no.
it's totally lame.
check out.
actually, their lattes are amazing.
well, we have to go.
cool.
maybe I'll see you later?
maybe.
what's the matter with you?
ladies, looking good.
you want to take it down a notch?
ladies.
that girl keeps smiling at me.
she likes you, dude.
she doesn't even know me.
she feels the heat.
see?
everyone's having a great time.
uh, I don't think so, little man.
you're kidding me, right?
your dad would kill me.
you're our designated driver.
this sucks.
what are you doing?
I just.
are you calling Amanda?
dude, you're missing the point.
forget Amanda.
forget her?
dude, you've been in that room for days.
you've got tub sores.
you're in pain.
forgetting her is a good thing.
this will help.
wait.
I tried that once and I did not like it.
you didn't do it right.
just do it.
come on.
and the wife says,"that's not a pig."
and the guy says,"I wasn't talking to you."
I don't get it.
what are you talking about, man?
it's ingenious.
what?
everything is vibrating or something.
Really?
Yes.
I feel a distinct hum.
dude, you're buzzed.
buzzed?
alcohol's kicking in.
I'm buzzed.
this is cool.
just us guys,bonding over lady trouble.
what kind of lady trouble do you have?
dude, Andi's been out of town for two weeks.
and when she's here she can be a real ball buster.
talking about ball buster, try your sister.
please.
I've had to live with that for 16 years.
why would you ever be with her by choice?
her dining habits alone.
the way she slurps.
you ever watch Hilary eat?
tiny nibbles.
she, like, flosses after every bite.
Andi doesn't wear deodorant.
there. I said it.
what do you have on Amanda?
I haven't thought about Amanda for six minutes and 14 seconds.
it's working!
they called it male bonding.
an exercise in forgetting our problems.
and the girls who had caused them.
I wasn't sure why I had to drink myself full of chemicals to achieve it, but they clearly felt like I needed the help.
go, go.
OK, ok.
dude, the head.
the head?
I love you guys.
I love you, too.
no, you gotta add the guys, man.
guys.
I love you.
ladies.
I'm drinking to forget my girlfriend.
come on, it'll be fun.
Oh, my god.
and that british accent.
he was totally laying on the charm.
how could you not be into him?
isn't he too old?
good old, not gross old.
popcorn.
there is a foreign hottie out there who seems really into you.
so?
do something about it.
you're available.
I guess.
you guess?
is there a romantic interest I'm not aware of?
only Kyle.
Oh, ok.
rewind.
is that a problem?
huge.
you lifted me so I could reach the peaks you lifted me to be a better man
here we go.
I think we should get Kyle out of here.
he's fine.
people are starting to stare.
now I'm making some serious dime.
OK, do you wantto win your money back?
nothing or double.
double or nothing.
that's what I said.
see this glass?
somebody over there, catch.
put that glass onto the bar.
I'm going to bounce this quarter off of this tableonto the countertop, off of that neon sign, off of that hanging light and skipping it offthe handle there.
beer tap.
beer tap.
that'll never happen.
thank you.
and into the glass.
I'll take that bet.
you will lose.
sir.
just do it.
pay up.
thank you, gentlemen.
I've enjoyed bonding with you.
I love you.
how long have you been into Kyle?
I guess I've always felt a special connection.
aren't you guys like, brother and sister?
no.
but you guys both have the same no belly button thing.
that doesn't mean we're related.
you sure seem like you are.
no, it's more like we're from the same village.
is everybody in a small town related?
in some parts of the country.
look, I can't help it if I think Kyle and I are soul mates.
I just do.
soul mates?
does Kyle know about any of this?
he's never said anything.
but I think he feels the same way.
or he will eventually.
Jessi,kyle is totally,hopelessly in love with amanda.
but they broke up.
that doesn't mean he's not still hung up on her.
you saw him.
he's been mired in Wallow town for days.
well, when will that end?
there's no exact time.
it could take months, years, forever to get over someone.
meanwhile, there's an exciting international man of my stery who wants to have coffee with you at the rack.
well, what about you?
what about me?
I'll be fine.
hot older guys always have hot older friends.
watch this.
Hey, the electric!
do you have one of those clappers like they sell on TV?
Kyle, you really shouldn't do that.
Oh, Mr. Grumpy.
please don't do that.
what else can you do?
well.
Oh, not good.
this is not good.
where the hell is Declan?
you're like, a magician or something.
Nope.
I was born in a pod.
I'm a science experiment.
you're funny.
you're bald.
Josh, do you mind?
we gotta get Kyle out of here.
not now.
my name is kyle and I am the result of a science experiment.
hang on.
it's Tom Foss.
Hello, Foss.
Kyle, I've been trying to call you.
you've been trying to call me what?
are you drunk?
no.
maybe.
Yes.
Kyle, listen to me.
don't.
not now.
I just hung up on Foss.
anyway, what was I saying?
so, Latnok took an embryo and put it in a pod with all these X and Y chromosomes, which is why there's no umbilical cord.
Yes!
that is my name!
gotta stop, buddy.
no.
I cannot stop.
because I'm Kyle.
I'm Kyle XY.
now can we leave?
it is a disaster.
everything's gonna be fine.
bringing Kyle home like this isn't fine.
Kyle, are you ok?
can't you do something like, I don't know, alter the polarity of your liver to process the alcohol or something?
I can't believe you did this to him.
me?
you were into this too until I cut you off.
Oh, about that.
I think I have ginger ale poisoning.
no way.
please tell me parked someplace else.
you lifted me so I could reach the peaks you made me drink so I could hardly speak what can I get for you?
I hear your lattes are exceptional.
I wouldn't go that far, but they don't disappoint.
I'll have one of them, then.
nonfat.
sorry.
have we met?
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
one latte, nonfat.
Oh, hello.
I'm Lori, by the way.
michael Cassidy.
Oh, here's my friend.
Ooh, a friend.
I want you to meet him.
thanks for the ride.
no problem.
thank you.
man.
now my butt smells like cabbage.
what else is new?
the window.
Hey, man, our car got towed in front of the Wild Coyote.
it's my dad's suv.
your daddy's car towed.
you guys might lose your X-Box for a few days.
I need to see your driver's license and your registration.
uh, the registration's in the car.
that's a problem, isn't it?
come on, man.
do you understand the absurdity of the conundrum that you presented?
how is that?
you asked us to show you our registration to retrieve our car.
but our car is locked behind a fence that you won't let us get to.
that is incredibly stupid.
are you calling me stupid?
uh, no, sir.
not at all.
can we just work something out, or.
sure.
I'll tell you what.
you give me 200 bucks, I'll let you go back and get your registration.
Ah, see, yeah, I don't.
I don't have $200 on me.
well, you know, I guess you're gonna have to call daddy.
you're good boys, aren't you?
what the hell are you doing?
why would you invite Lori Trager here if you knew you were meeting me?
I don't see the problem.
is there a problem?
you told me not to see her.
change of plans.
a change of plans?
I changed my mind.
I thought you'd be happy about it.
whatever.
are you purging?
Yeah.
just tossing out everything dated last century.
so you realize all the kids are out?
Yeah.
I want to finish.
are you mad at me?
Nope.
just busy.
you are mad at me.
Why?
I'm not mad.
it's just.
here I was, trying to reach out to jessi, something I rarely get a chance to do.
and you barge in here with the same nonsense about Lori and her bad attitude or whatever it is you call it.
she lied to me.
I know that.
but there was no good reason for you to object to her seeing Mark.
mark's two years older.
you're four years older than me.
she's in high schooland he's in college.
he's smart, he's responsible.
the kind of boy we want her to be with.
but you laid down the law and she broke it.
so you got all puffed up.
puffed up?
she didn't do what you wanted her to do, and your ego took a hit.
is that all?
that's all.
almost there.
why are we doing this again?
to get your registrationfrom the car.
am I bleeding?
no.
OK.
your turn.
show off.
just look for the car.
I can't believe we're doing this.
this is all my fault.
acknowledged.
I was just trying to make Kyle feel better.
I don't.
I feel terrible.
it'll pass.
I don't feel better about anything.
you gonna start in on me too?
you should have let me call Amanda when I wanted.
fine. You know what?
go ahead, call her.
beg for forgiveness.
you'll probably pull it off, too, 'cause you're Kyle.
perfect Kyle.
you always know just what to do.
what was that about?
I don't know.
I feel sick.
don't leave me, buddy.
come on.
I feel really sick.
holy crap.
what did you do?
I altered the polarity of my liver to return my body to homeostasis.
that's what I said.
Oh, no.
you stole the car?
it's your car.
get in.
get out!
what?
you're drunk. I'm not getting in the car with you. Get in back.
stay where you are!
we're all gonna die.
get back here!
Oh, great.
just great.
at least I got your car back.
you've been really awesome tonight. Thank you.
it's just a flat tire.
we can fix it.
right.
Kyle can twitch his nose or channel his chi or something.
we all know you're the man.
you're the savior.
I'm the screw up.
what are you talking about?
what am I talking about?
just...
just fix it.
I will.
what's taking so long, huh?
come on, work your magic.
why are you acting like this?
you got a problem?
Hey, stop!
come on.
you guys should be looking after me, not the other way around.
this is crazy.
I'm the sober one.
I'm the designated driver.
I'm refereeing the fight.
and giving girl advice.
when you think about it, I'm the only one with a successful, functioning relationship.
what am I doing with you two losers?
what are you doing with your life now?
are you going to college or working?
I'm not that old.
you are very mature.
I've had to learn quickly.
it shows.
I haven't seen you around the apartment.
my mother.
she left.
she left me.
I'm sorry.
I'm all right.
it's ok if you're not.
you will be.
let me explain.
what? How you like jerking girls around?
one minute you're into me, then suddenly you're not.
can I talk?
we play the whole accidental run-in thing.
then you gave me a kiss, which from my vantage point you seemed to like.
and then, boom, suddenly you don't want to defy my father or jeopardize your future or some other lame-ass excuse.
but it's.- let me finish.
I thought we had something, but clearly you don't.
the least you could have done was been man enough to be honest.
excuse me.
did I do something?
No!
why are you so angry?
if you ask me, he's still hung up on Lori.
it's not about Lori or Hilary.
it's not about girls at all.
you're not, uh.
it's about my ankle, you idiot!
I went to see a specialist the other day.
top foot guy around.
treats the seahawksand the sonics.
turns out there's this little bone.
talus or something.
anyway, mine's been fracturedfor like, years, he said.
maybe if they would have caught it.
they didn't.
so I've been playing on it.
never healed right.
what about the surgery you had before?
it's a different part of the ankle.
just one of those things.
diminished function, I think they call it.
basketball's history.
I should have cracked a bookonce in a while, I guess.
I'll uh,get the spare.
are you in pain?
some.
is that why you wanted to get drunk tonight?
to forget?
maybe, yeah.
Kyle, you step up and face your problems, but me, I run away.
for once I guess I wanted you to do the same.
when I saw you like that tonight, it made me feel so bad about my life.
I understand.
uh, guys, I don't think we have a spare.
your father drives around without a spare?
guess so.
now I've got to call him.
what am I supposed to say?
Hey, dad!
you want to come pick us up?
we just did some serious underage drinking.
and then, after Kyle's humongous ralph, we shredded the back tire breaking out of an impound lot.
thanks for driving, by the way.
you should have seen this guy back at the bar.
he picked up a bald chick.
you did?
she wasn't bald.
her head was shaved.
there's a difference.
cue ball.
I don't really remember that much.
you don't?
Why?
did I do something?
Oh, no.
nothing, really.
gentlemen, our luckis about to change.
now you are gonna pay for what you did back there,boy.
I'd like to.
eighty-five dollars for the impound fee and whateverit costs to fix the fence.
I don't want your money.
what the hell are you?
all right.
keep it.
I got something better.
I don't like that she lied.
I don't either.
but I guess my ego did come into play.
but I didn't get all puffed up.
how about slightly inflated?
I'm sorry I interrupted you and Jessi earlier.
I'll get another chance.
I'll tell Lori it's ok to see Mark.
I just hope it's not too late.
I knew Jessi was good for something.
mother relationships are a tricky business.
believe me, I know.
did yours leave, too?
maybe I'll tell you more about it someday when I know you better.
we're supposed to be closed.
is there anything else?
sorry, love.
here you go.
she's a bit icy, isn't she?
I kissed her boyfriend.
Oh, really?
we always had a special connection.
you and her boyfriend.
Yeah.
it's hard to explain.
but it's there.
it's like we speak the same language, have the same thoughts.
that is a rare thing to find.
Yeah, well.
for some reason he think she's meant to be with Amanda.
have you told this boy how you feel?
it's complicated.
I'm living in the same house now.
listen, Jessi, you are a very special young lady.
you're brilliant, beautiful ,unique, you know.
from what I've seen,that Amanda girl has nothing on you.
and if you really do sense that special bond between you and Kyle, you should act on it.
how did you know his name?
I never mentioned it.
there's a lot of things I know about you, Jessi.
a lot more than you think.
and many that you don't know about me.
I don't understand.
I think it's time I explained.
man, I feel like I've been hit by a truck.
me, too and I didn't even drink.
is Amanda's light still on?
I can't help it.
you could always get drunk every night.
I don't ever want to get drunk like that again.
I don't want to forget how much I care about Amanda and why she's so important to me.
so, you happy being miserable?
I'm gonna have to work through it.
nothing I can do or say is gonna help her understand.
well, except the truth.
what?
Josh is right.
why not tell her everything?
I can't.
why not?
you told us the truth.
it's not the same.
it's totally the same.
bro, I don't understand.
go for it, man.
I can't!
it's not the same.
Amanda loves me and if I tell her everything.
I don't want her to stop loving me.
you've already lost her.
you've got nothing to lose.
you know, I rarely agree with this guy here, but he's right, Kyle.
nothing to lose and everything to gain.
seems too easy.
sometimes the best solutions are.
I'm gonna tell her.
dude, you made a breakthrough.
go now.
before you lose your nerve.
I love you guys.
after a night of mistakes and valuable lessons learned,
I finally understood male bonding.
it's not using your friends to forget.
it's remembering how lucky you are to have them.
all right, go.
so.
you can give me a lift home.
let's go.
foss, I can't talk right now.
I've been trying to reach you.
I was with my friends.
Yeah.
getting drunk!
when I call you it's important.
I'm sorry.
you answer the phone and you stay on it!
I needed you and you were gone.
there's been a lot going on.
listen to me.
Adam Baylin. What?
what about him?
he's been deteriorating.
and I've been moving him from location to location.
staying on the run.
Why?
what's been going on?
he wanted to see you, Kyle.
tell me!
Adam died today.
he died?
you may not realize it yet, but this changes everything.
is there a romantic interest I'm not aware of?
only Kyle. - Kyle?
I've see one of these symbols before.
Kyle has a ring with this on it.
he got it from his birth father.
Adam something. - Adam Baylin?
if Andi can't stay here, then she has to move to Cleveland.
I know that's gonna be hard for you to deal with.
everyone at Latnok seems genuine.
but I'm still not convinced about Cassidy.
seen anyone around my office?
I caught Jessi there this morning.
Jessi? I'm well aware of Jessi's gifts, but I also know she's volatile and unpredictable.
her mother's an old friend of Latnok.
what do you know about Sarah?
I found something in Cassidy's office.
he has Sarah's ring. - How?
something to do with her disappearance.
recall your experiences from that night and examine your memories.
it's working.
I see something.
he killed her!
she's dead!
my mother is dead.
we need to find out why he did it.
we will.
Hi, Jessi. I didn't know you were here.
what's wrong?
I... - It's OK.
what happened?
I heard you thrashing around.
it was just a bad dream.
it was terrible.
I was at Latnok and... I don't really rember.
well, it's over now. Are you OK?
thank you for checking on me.
it's late.
we should get back to sleep.
OK. Good night.
good night.
listen, Josh, I know you're upset about Andi leaving.
I've been walking around with a pit in my stomach.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
every time I think about her being gone...
but she's not yet.
don't waste your last few days together moping around.
what am I supposed to do?
give her a big send-off.
what are her favorite things?
but just playing that for three days straight would be, well, what we always do.
she's into the Cowkeys, but they're out on tour.
and Star Trek.
star Trek? Popular science-fiction entertainment, encompassing six television series and several feature films.
well, thank you, Mr. Wikipedia.
have you seen any of them? - No.
we'll take you when the new movie comes out.
you'll like Spock. He's half-Vulcan, half-human.
alien race.
so he's different than everyone else.
he struggles to understand human emotion.
sees the world from a unique perspective.
sounds interesting.
Ah, our man from the pod can relate.
except Spock's got really big ears.
which I have out in the garage.
you own Spock ears?
want to dig 'em up?
impress Andi? Come on.
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you.
that's not easy to do.
is something wrong?
well...I need to talk to you about something.
I saw you the other night.
kissing Jessi.
I'm sorry.
no, you don't need to apologize.
the two of you have shared so much. You have a unique bond.
it's not that surprising that you'd be attracted to each other.
it is, to me.
I mean, Jessi's always been really important to me, but... these new feelings...
I just don't how to deal with them.
feelings are confusing for ordinary teenagers living in separate houses.
it's so much more complicated for the two of you.
so, what do we do?
you may not like it, but you and Jessi live here together, as part of our family.
and for you to pursue that kind of relationship, well, it's just not appropriate.
I'm sorry, Kyle. I haven't set this kind of boundary with you before.
it won't happen again.
thank you.
I don't want either of you to be hurt.
and you know how fragile Jessi is.
Hey. I just signed for this.
what is it?
the label not clear enough for you?
I've got a new project for you.
Oh, yeah?
I want you to team up with Kyle.
Seriously?
Yeah. It's the formula for a growth accelerant.
we've been trying to crack it for months.
the two of you can make some headway.
I don't want to work with him.
ask Jessi.
no, that ain't gonna happen.
I need someone I can trust.
besides, play nicely with Kyle, and you might make progress with that chick you're seeing.
I'll e-mail you the assignment.
police are searching for any clues that may shed light on the murder of a hunter found in the woods near Victor Falls almost a month ago.
the victim's throat was crushed.
so far, police have no motive for the killing and no suspects have been named.
come on, people, move it along.
I thought you were open for business.
that's right. My business.
we were just... - Tell you what.
sibling benefit.
ten minutes. Start slurping.
this may be one of the few places we can be alone together.
Jessi? - What?
did you listen in on me and Nicole this morning?
Yes, and I don't think it's any of her business.
we live in her house.
we're part of her family.
so kissing me meant nothing to you?
of course it meant something to me.
then how could you not want to be together?
Kyle when you kissed me, I felt such a rush through my entire body.
didn't you feel it?
is it me, or are you getting a vibe?
trying not to. But they're definitely sitting at least two inches closer than they used to.
you don't think they're...?
I don't wanna talk about it.
can we talk about something else?
Absolutely.
so how goes things with you and Nate?
good. - That's great.
you don't like him.
I don't really know him.
how well do you?
it's still really new.
I guess he doesn't talk about himself too much.
I don't want to dump on what could be a really good thing for you.
I just want you to be careful.
make sure you can trust this guy, that's all.
Amanda. Hey. - Nate, hi.
how's it going? - Good.
good. Is Kyle around? - Kyle?
he's back there. Why?
I just want to partner up on a project with him.
that's really nice.
well, uh, see you later? - Yeah.
am I interrupting anything?
no.
so Cassidy's got something for us to work on together. You up for it?
you and me?
why didn't Cassidy ask me to work with Kyle?
I don't know. He doesn't like you.
well?
fine. - Good.
you'll have another chance to impress me.
we can't be together at Latnok either.
we can't let Cassidy know we suspect anything.
we can't cause any trouble.
if he wants me and Nate to work together, we have to go along with it.
time's up. Get out.
Hey. You're home early. Where's Kyle?
at Latnok, without me. - Oh.
I'm not as fragile as you think.
Jessi... - You don't understand how much Kyle means to me.
I know how close you feel to him.
no. Nobody cares about me like he does.
no one makes me feel as happy or as safe.
I need that. I need him.
Jessi, Kyle can still be there for you.
but while you're both living in this house, he can't be with you, not in that way.
I need to know why you have a problem with Jessi.
she, uh...She was poking around in here the other day.
I think she may have broken into my safe.
why would she do that?
I was hoping you could tell me.
I don't know anything about it.
well, did you know that after your mother's car accident,
Jessi said to me that if I ever harmed you or your family, she'd kill me.
she was just being protective.
she could never do anything like that.
Really?
Jessi's a good person.
she's lucky to have a friend like you.
I'm just not sure you know who you're really dealing with.
is that all?
Yeah.
you scared me.
I owe you a few.
what are you doing?
reading you.
what?
I know the look when a girl has a boy on her mind.
what?
you tell me. You can't keep those kinds of secrets in this house.
Kyle kissed me.
wait a second, clarify. Did he actually kiss you?
or did you throw yourself at him? - He kissed me.
there was no throwing involved.
why does everyone think that's so wrong?
because it's Kyle, of the pure and beautiful soul.
we only want what's best for him.
which means not me.
no. - Get out.
get out!
God, I hate myself sometimes.
why do I say cruel things to people?
uh, to Declan, Hillary or Jessi?
Jessi was the lucky recipient.
but I couldn't help it.
am I supposed to ignore that the two of you were huddled up at The Rack?
huddled up? - We were just talking.
sharing secrets. - Lori.
what kind of secrets?
have anything to do with Latnok?
Yes. Most of the students there have been great.
it's Cassidy I need to know more about.
so I have to make him believe I'm on his side.
you need an olive branch.
an overture.
ask him out to dinner.
invite him here.
if you want him to believe he's winning you over, a dinner invitation from your parents...
I'd like to meet this guy anyway.
no, I don't want him in this house.
Kyle, you're not doing this unless we're part of it.
you and Josh shouldn't be here. - But I want to be.
you make Cassidy too uncomfortable.
why is everybody shutting me out?
I haven't done anything wrong.
Jessi... - You don't want me around either.
you know that's not true.
know what? I won't bother any of you anymore.
you'd better leave the door open.
you know, what we're doing with Cassidy is all about you.
I'm trying to figure out why Sarah was killed, and I need him to trust me.
so if he wants to drive a wedge between us, we have to let him.
I just hate how everyone's looking at me like I'm this horrible person.
nobody in the family does.
and you shouldn't care what Cassidy thinks about you.
fine. Have your dinner. I'll stay away.
Jessi, I need to know that you're committed to this.
I have to trust that you can keep things under control.
don't you know me well enough to be sure?
I just don't want any surprises.
Lori, I need you to help me with something.
but you'll have to keep it a secret.
espionage? All over it.
so what's my mission?
I need to know more about Cassidy.
I think we should adjust the floor value here.
too many ideal elements.
the algorithm lost stability about three adjustments ago.
you're right.
easy to miss.
apparently, not for you.
Cassidy teamed us up. He must think you can contribute.
Cassidy just wants us to get along.
I know he supervises everything, but have you ever seen him report to anybody?
why do you ask?
curious.
well, I have no idea who he answers to.
all those senior Latnok guys, they're all cloak and dagger, minus the dagger.
right.
so, what do we got?
maybe if we adjust the values in this sequence here...
that's it.
Cassidy's had people working on this for months and you solved it.
just like that.
we solved it.
I guess we're done.
I wanted to thank you.
for what?
for making an effort with Nate.
it means a lot to me.
I just want you to be happy, Amanda.
I want the same for you.
so, what's this big surprise? G- Forcemarathon?
give me more credit than that.
well, show me already.
not yet. Still gotta kick out a couple of paying customers so I can reap benefits that come with minimum wage authority.
Ooh, it turns me on when you go crazy with power.
just give me a minute.
whatever it is, he hasn't stopped working on it.
Yeah, he's such a cute worker bee when he puts his mind to something.
all right, guys, time's up.
makes me sad to think his ambition might stop when I leave.
I don't know about that.
he's already offered to take half of my shifts next week.
I think he wants to stay busy so he doesn't miss you as much.
I'm sorry, did I say something?
no, it's fine. It's just...
my moms changed our plans.
we're not leaving in three days.
we're leaving in the morning.
and Josh doesn't know?
this is our last night together.
Mrs. Trager, I presume.
Mr. Cassidy. - It's Michael, please.
these are for you.
Oh. They're beautiful.
please, come in.
thank you.
pleasure, sir.
Kyle, how you doing, man?
Hey, dude. - Hello.
it smells, uh, ridiculously delicious in here.
don't let that fool you.
can I get you a drink?
it smells, uh, ridiculously delicious in here.
you know what it is?
give a girl a minute.
the lights, like little stars, shiny surfaces.
it feels very... futuristic.
an interesting observation, Miss Jensen.
Oh, my God.
I love Star Trek.
I wanted to give you something really special.
you did.
so you know what to do?
the mission is clear.
you love this, don't you?
nothing like a little intrigue and reconnaissance to light up the night.
here they come. Hey!
sorry. Too much?
Yeah, a little. A tad. Just, uh, act natural.
Hey, we just bumped into each other.
so did we.
I mean, we were both here waiting for you, separately.
and then we decided to sit at this table. Here at The Rack.
and we're all here now, so you guys want to hang out for a few?
um, OK.
great. - Fantastic.
Hi.
this is wonderful.
thank you.
I haven't had a good home-cooked meal in I don't even know how long.
where is home, Mr. Cassidy?
Brooklyn.
OK.
uh, England. East London.
little town called Hackney.
still have family there?
we've scattered.
but I love Seattle. And my work keeps me busy, so...
Kyle tells us you're not a scientist.
no. I'm definitely missing that gene.
so, what exactly is your contribution at Latnok?
I foster.
I encourage. Basically, I'm a professional nag.
Kyle can attest to my persistence.
Yes, I can.
I think we'd all like to hear what's expected of Kyle.
Jessi, what are you doing here?
I live here.
I thought you had plans to be out tonight.
I changed my mind.
well, we were just having dinner.
great. Is there a place for me?
of course there is.
I'll get you a plate.
it must be exciting to have two minds like Kyle's and Jessi's mix.
Oh, thrilling! Thrilling.
Kyle's a natural-born leader.
and Jessi shows great potential.
this brownie is amazing.
so good you want to save some for later.
my cobbler's pretty great.
want some?
Trager doesn't eat cooked fruit.
so, what are you guys doing later?
whatever it is, we can't go back to my house.
I've been banished.
your boss, Cassidy, is over for dinner with Kyle and my parents.
he's not our boss.
I thought he called the shots.
Oh, I get it. What happens at Latnok, stays at Latnok.
that's right, top secret.
no, we like to keep the details confidential, but... I think I can trust you.
Cassidy's in charge, but we have tons of freedom.
he knows when to help and when to get out of our way.
so you like working with him?
he's fine.
Yeah, whatever. He's, um...
you know, we should get going if we're gonna catch a movie. - No!
I mean, I wanna try your cobbler.
you used to dream about Mr. Spock?
Oh, in my mind, we were dating.
I was only 12, rember?
it was innocent.
we'd do things like eat cotton candy and play foosball at the International Space Station.
three days before you leave, and you pull out this great goofy stuff.
thank you.
for what?
I just don't think I've said it enough.
you've been so great.
I haven't been the typical first girlfriend and you've always been there for me.
through everything.
and I have to tell you...
whoa. Stop.
no heartfelt goodbyes.
we still have plenty of time for that.
Yeah, but... - No buts.
tonight is about you and me in our own private universe.
you want to go where no man has gone before?
or just once before?
how long have you been waiting to say that?
all night long.
Michael, you know, Kyle and Jessi share very unusual backgrounds.
two peas in a pod, so to speak.
we've tried to keep their lives very private.
my biggest concern is that they always stay protected.
Absolutely.
look, my apologies for Latnok's regrettable actions on prom night.
regrettable is putting it mildly.
fair enough.
but let me assure you, from this point forward,
Kyle and Jessi's well being is always at the forefront.
you know what I'd like to hear about?
my mother.
what? He must know Sarah.
certainly I've heard of her.
brilliant woman.
Oh, so you've never met?
never had the pleasure.
really.
Jessi, you know she's been in hiding for years.
she wants nothing to do with Latnok.
that's right.
she didn't trust you.
she never met me.
it's Latnok she had... has a problem with.
Nate and I finished that project for you.
so soon? Great. You must be working well together.
he was very helpful.
what was the project about?
we don't know anything about this guy and he's here having dinner.
Jessi. - He doesn't trust me?
I don't trust him.
Jessi, please.
he's done terrible things.
what are you talking about?
you're a liar!
you have secrets.
maybe we should tell this family about the secret you've been keeping from them.
I think it's beholden upon me to tell you what sort of person you have living under your roof.
you remember that first night, Jessi.
after the explosion you found your way out of the pod and left Zzyzx.
you took a little wander in the woods.
you came across a man camping.
no.
a stranger to you.
please stop.
and you killed him.
an hour out of the pod, and she murdered someone.
I'm afraid that's the sort of person that she is.
it's in her nature.
Jessi, what is he saying?
I have the news reports.
the murder's still unsolved. - I didn't murder him.
he had a knife. - Then it's true?
no. I was alone. I was scared.
he tried to attack me.
Oh, my God. - I'm not a killer!
I'm not a killer.
wait!
I'm terribly sorry.
I hate to drop news like that on you.
I just can't believe it.
it's a lot to take in.
but I do feel I had to tell you.
we've been concerned about Jessi for quite some time.
knowing that she's here with your family now...
I don't think any of us want someone so unpredictable getting closer to Kyle.
are you OK?
she was so upset.
I just hope she's all right.
this is why he's extraordinary.
he's only concerned about her.
so is it off-limits, or can you tell us what you're working on at Latnok now?
unbelievable.
what's with this super perky friendly routine?
I'm showing interest. I'm being nice.
that's so not like you.
it's sweet that you're trying to connect with me as Declan's ex-girlfriend.
see? I'm sweet.
I'm trying to connect.
and in answer to your question, I've got a bunch of new ideas, too soon to discuss.
you have to run them by Cassidy?
why all this interest in Cassidy?
I just want to get a sense of your life.
Oh. - I don't like him.
he didn't want me to date you at first, and he didn't exactly threaten me, but we got pretty close to Don Corleone territory.
the guy creeps me out. - How weird.
Kyle, I know tonight didn't work out the way we'd hoped.
we all want the best for Jessi.
but clearly, she's a very troubled girl.
and you've spent an excessive amount of time being her anchor.
that has got to be draing.
she's my friend.
I'd do anything for her.
you're a good man.
I just don't want her instability jeopardize your future.
we never had a chance to talk about that... - I'd still like to.
maybe we can meet later.
that would be wonderful.
the Rack?
half an hour?
sounds like a plan.
OK, the coast is clear.
I always pictured the fairy-tale ending to the perfect date as me climbing through your sister's window.
I wish I could beam you up to maintain the theme of our evening.
anyway, let's move.
Yes, sir.
he's coming.
dad!
Hey. How's it going? - Hey.
is Star Treknight over already?
what happened? Did you get mopey again?
no, it was great. You were right.
Andi loved the whole super-galactic send-off. Genius idea.
then why...?
let me explain.
Josh, I can't believe you look so tired.
I'll go tell your mother that you're home and that you're going straight to bed.
to sleep.
so this is it.
my domain.
Wow. You must study a lot.
there's always someone studying more.
why do you make everything a competion?
Wow. Direct.
sorry.
no, I think I need that.
you should call me on my stuff. It's good.
can I get you anything?
I could use a soda.
machine's right downstairs.
no Belly Button
your beverage, milady.
thank you.
you OK?
fine.
Hello?
is anyone here?
Jessi. Where is everyone?
we closed early.
I don't know what it is you want.
the truth.
I know you killed Sarah.
Why?
Sarah left.
I'm sorry she couldn't handle being your mother.
don't you dare speak of her that way.
she didn't leave me, you killed her.
you need help.
actually, I think you do.
see what's happening to the water?
I can do that to you.
I can manipulate the blood flow in your body.
what? - I can target certain areas and make the vessels expand and contract.
Jessi, listen... - Why did she have to die?
I suggest that you answer me.
you don't want to accept that Sarah left.
I had nothing to do with it!
what are you doing?
stop! Don't!
you need to calm down.
he murdered my mother!
stay out of it.
it didn't happen that way.
what are you saying?
you want the truth?
Sarah attacked me.
what? - She saw me that night!
she knew I was Latnok.
she was gonna kill me.
she lost it!
I was protecting myself. I had no choice.
you're lying.
I can tell that you're lying.
it makes no sense.
Jessi! You need to tell her what's going on.
Baylin's experiment.
prolonged gestation in a pod.
we're starting it up again.
the experiment.
why would you do that?
I'm looking at the reason.
you're a success.
Sarah found out.
she didn't approve.
so you killed her!
you took everything from me!
my mother! And now Kyle!
Jessi! Jessi, don't!
you know what I did. You can't even look at me anymore.
that's not true.
we can get through this.
no. It doesn't matter anymore.
I'm already a murder. - No!
Jessi. Speak to me.
Kyle, she's... - No, don't say it!
please. It didn't work.
Jessi, please! Breathe!
Kyle, I got nothing, man.
I got nothing.
come on, we gotta get out of here.
Oh, my God.
we gotta get out of here. - I won't leave her.
Kyle, you can't be here.
you can't be here, man.
Jessi, I'm sorry.
they're gone.
are you all right?
I slowed my heartbeat down to two beats per minute.
and it was strangely relaxing.
you better go.
Nicole's waiting for you at home.
do you think we convinced Cassidy?
he'll send people to clean up the mess.
won't they tell him they didn't find my body?
don't worry. I'll take care of it.
I'm so happy you're home.
are you all right?
Oh, I'm fine.
Kyle explained the trick you were pulling on Cassidy.
I wish I'd known about it from the beginning.
we didn't want to worry you.
that part of your plan was unsuccessful.
Nicole, I'm really sorry I didn't tell you about what happened to me that night.
I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
and the way I reacted...
Jessi, you know you can always count on me.
I was just so surprised, hearing it like that.
that's why I decided to tell Kyle before.
when we were planning all this, he said,"No surprises."
and that was the one secret I never shared.
so I told him.
and he understood.
he always does.
so how did it go at The Rack?
just like we wanted.
I don't like that Kyle's still out there with Cassidy.
Kyle can handle him.
we had fooled Cassidy, and he revealed my biggest challenge:
Latnok was re-starting Adam's experiment.
I had to stop them.
I had to keep up the charade.
it was an accident.
you know that? - That doesn't change what happened.
she was gonna kill me.
you saved my life.
Kyle, I promise I will take care of this.
I will take care of you.
but you need to pull it together and go home.
tell them you met with me, but you never saw Jessi.
look at me. Look at me.
I'll make sure there is no trace of what happened.
this never happened.
as far as anyone's concerned, Jessi ran away and she's not coming back.
do you understand?
Yes.
we're in this together now, Kyle.
and together, there is nothing that we can't do.
but we need to trust each other.
I trust you.
do you trust me?
I hadn't had much experience lying.
do you trust me?
but when it was necessary...
I do.
...it turned out I was good at it.
we'll have to start at the beginning.
einstein spent seven weeks longer in his mother's womb.
that's why he was smarter.
I worked years developing an artificial womb.
it was supported by a secret group known as Latnok.
when you first came here, everything in the world was new.
Adam created me, but you are my family.
I saw you kissing Jessi. It just wouldn't be appropriate.
it won't happen again.
when you kissed me, I felt such a rush. Didn't you feel it?
my heart says there's still something there.
as much as I want us to be together, we can't.
my Mom's changed our plans. - Josh doesn't know?
this is our last night together.
no heartfelt goodbyes. Tonight is about you and me.
you're going straight to bed.
who are you? - Michael Cassidy.
they put enormous pressure on me to bring you in.
they wanted their greatest achievement on their side.
why the interest in Cassidy?
I don't like him. The guy creeps me out.
you know what I would like to hear about? My mother.
I think it's beholding upon me to tell you what sort of person you have living under your roof.
after the explosion, she came across a man camping.
and she killed him.
Oh, my God. - It's in her nature.
he murdered my mother.
she knew I was Latnok. She was gonna kill me.
Baylin's experiment... we're starting it up again.
Sarah found out.
I'm already a murderer!
how did it go at the Rack? - Just like we wanted.
Kyle's still out there with Cassidy. - Kyle can handle him.
you saved my life. I will take care of this. Do you trust me?
I do.
ruse.
charade.
deception.
no matter how you define the words, they begin and end with a lie.
here you go, mate.
my mum always said tea was medicine for the soul.
how are you feeling?
how should I feel?
it's going to take some going through.
you've been through a lot tonight.
what are you going to tell everyone else at Latnok?
this group here doesn't need to know anything other than what you're gonna tell your family about Jessi running away.
but the senior members, they know.
you told them already? - It's my job, mate.
got to keep them up to speed.
but they're not even care that Jessi's dead?
you have to understand. You're their guy.
you always have been.
come on.
I want to show you something.
was this mine? - The one and only.
took a little maneuvering to rebuild it after the explosion at Zzyzx, but, but that's why our young geniuses come in so handy.
they rebuilt this?
not exactly.
they built it in pieces.
mark's algorithms.
Nate's hover board magnets.
everyone contributed something.
you tricked them.
their inventions had practical applications.
that's all they needed to know. - What did I give you?
I'm sure you can figure it out.
the growth accelerant that Nate and I developed.
helps with muscle growth. - Why didn't you just tell me that this is what you were doing when you brought me in?
how would you have felt about that?
if Zzyzx had their way,
I would have spent my entire life in this pod as some type of bio-computer.
that's not the kind of technology you want falling into the wrong hands.
there's your answer.
they knew you wouldn't approve.
they were right.
but...
you don't really have a choice in the matter, do you?
unless you want everyone you know to know the truth about what you did to Jessi.
is that what this is?
more blackmail?
I like to think of it as self-preservation.
we gonna have a problem with that?
look, in a couple of days,
Latnok are gonna have a warehouse full of specimens in gestation to keep them occupied.
they already have everything they need?
I have everything they need.
I give it to them...
they leave you alone.
consider this your freedom.
my gift to you.
my lies had brought me an offer of freedom.
but now Adam's misguided experiment was in the hands of a blackmailer...
a murderer.
I knew I wouldn't truly be free until I stopped him.
thank God.
you're okay?
it worked. I got him to tell me everything.
what did he say? - I'll explain it all, I promise.
but I need to see Jessi. I need to know that she's okay.
I'm okay.
your arms are growing.
they are?
they're at least a half-centimeter bigger in circumference.
have you increased your exercise regimen?
maybe a little.
your...
your pectoral muscles are also expanding.
what?
your hand...
feels nice.
does this one, too?
yes
did you just shock me?
no. Why would I shock you?
I don't know. I...
I felt a charge go through my body.
that's your libido. - What?
no it isn't.
I would have felt that before.
you never felt a charge with Amanda?
I felt other things.
well, maybe there was a power surge in the area.
maybe.
so, how did you sleep last night?
I didn't.
neither did I.
Jessi I'm...
I'm sorry you had to go through that.
I'm sure it wasn't easy...
confronting Cassidy about Sarah.
I was acting.
I'm fine.
I promise.
there's that power surge again.
Josh is still asleep, but I talked to Lori about what's going on.
I'll finish getting dressed and be right out.
I'll be in the other room, pretending to be dead.
I'm not happy about this.
I'm sorry. Jessi came in, and things got weird. But, - It won't happen again. - Not that. Well, yes, that. But more importantly, I don't like this game you guys are playing with Cassidy. It's dangerous.
I don't like it either.
I've given you a lot of leeway in the past, but this just feels different.
there's something about it. Something about Cassidy...
he scares me.
I'm going to take care of it.
I promise.
I need it to be over.
we can't keep doing this to our family.
hide and seek with parents downstairs is not cool.
straight to voice mail? Not cool.
leaving without saying goodbye? Even less cool.
what's wrong with you?
call me back.
can anyone help me figure out how to throttle my girlfriend long-distance?
why long-distance? - Because she left.
Vamoosed. Hitched a ride on the a-train to Cleveland.
she didn't even have the courage to tell me in person.
she left this on my pillow.
on your pillow?
ask Dad.
Oh, I will.
mom?
are you okay?
you know what?
Yeah.
if she's just gonna up and leave like that, forget her.
I'm fine.
dandy. Copa-freakin'-cetic.
she was probably afraid to say goodbye.
then she's a coward. Good riddance.
Josh, I'm sorry.
but there's something else we need to talk about...
here's what I have so far.
leave it open.
in order to fill, say, 100 pods,
Cassidy would need at least 5, 000 gallons of formula on hand.
not to mention the space he'd need to house the pods.
I ran a search, and there are over 5300 warehouses in Seattle that are big enough.
the formula would have to be kept at a certain temperature in order to sustain its nutritional elements...
probably a few degrees below body temperature.
that's a way to narrow it down.
we can access the city police's thermal imaging scans, like how they find the people growing the weed.
the weed? - Yeah, the...
the blaze.
the herb.
the chronic.
where did you pick that up? - Cable.
once we find where they're hiding the formula, we need to sabotage it so that it doesn't work.
and destroy any way of re-creating it.
what about the pods? How do we destroy them?
we won't need to. Without the formula, they're useless.
where?
I hear her heartbeat.
you're still listening for her heartbeat?
it comes naturally now.
she's coming to the window.
you've gotta go. She can't see you. You're supposed to be missing.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
I know this is weird, but I really need to talk to you and I don't want anyone else to know about it.
what happened?
here, come in.
I think you were right about Nate. - What did he do?
I found all this odd research in his dorm room.
you were in his dorm room?
I saw the number from the Ouija board.
when you asked what your birthday was?
there were drawings of these chambers...
that could carry a baby without a birth mother. Or an umbilical cord.
your father's name, Adam Baylin, was everywhere.
I know you have secrets, and I try not to pry, but Kyle, - it's like he was studying your life. - Does he know you saw all of this?
you said there were people who would use those you care about to get to you.
is he one of them?
I think he might be.
why do I always do this?
why do I always get involved with the lying, cheating jerks?
I'm sorry.
Amanda, I need you to stay away from him.
I can't guarantee it's safe to be around him.
what?
it's you.
the Charlies, the Nates of this world...
those are the real jerks.
you, no matter what, are one of the good guys.
I always knew you were.
even when I thought I didn't.
I try to be.
you are.
kissing Amanda, I felt a rolling flutter deep inside.
I'd heard the term before, 'butterflies.'
how was it possible to feel electricity for one person and butterflies for another?
I think Cassidy has Adam's data stored on an isolated server at the university.
I saw the system last night. If I can get back in there,
I can swap it out with a dummy drive and figure out if he made any back-ups.
I need to get rid of all of them.
don't you think Cassidy would be watching you closely?
I'll need some sort of distraction.
you can't go.
you're dead. - I know.
and dead girls get stuck in the house doing thermal scans of Seattle's industrial district.
I almost hate to suggest it, but what about Mark?
we don't know if we can fully trust him yet.
I do.
I mean, based on my little recon mission last night, we know he's no fan of Cassidy's.
and I know it's not my life we're talking about, but, your secret is my secret, too. It's all of ours.
do we have to spend the rest of our lives not ever letting anyone else in?
this situation is too extreme, Lori. No matter how much you care about him.
the problem is, we don't have anyone else who has an excuse to be in Latnok.
that's not entirely true.
what is this, Bring Your Mother to Work Day?
Mrs. Trager?
I'm sorry, Michael. I hate to bother you like this, but, can I speak to you? It's about last night.
I know I wasn't the best dinner guest, but I didn't think my behavior - warranted a house call. - No, it's Jessi.
she never came home.
I see. I'm sorry.
come in.
Thanks.
so, she wasn't at her apartment?
first place I checked.
I don't know why I thought she might come here, especially after your confrontation. But,
I didn't know where else to look.
Yeah, I'm sorry. This is my fault.
Oh, please, no.
it's not the first time she's run away, unfortunately...
where did she go the last time? - The woods.
it's a long story, and yes, we've already looked.
she's had a rough go of it.
you used to counsel her, didn't you?
is there a problem?
no, not at all. It's just...
it's a bit of a sore subject.
I received a warning for taking her in. I almost lost my license.
well, she was very lucky to have had you helping her.
thank you.
it's nice to feel appreciated.
you've done an amazing job with Kyle.
all I know, you mean a lot to him.
he means a lot to us.
are you cleaning?
in a manner of speaking, yes. I am cleaning my life.
I have too many things that remind me of Andy. I am purging...
and please don't touch anything. It's all exactly where I want it.
staphylococcus aureus.
no. That is in fact a cup.
inside the cup. The bacteria.
how long has this been here?
could be this morning... Could be last month...
your room is the perfect environment for it to grow.
it's warm, dark, and a little...
manly? - Dank.
why am I letting you stand in my room and insult me?
because your dankness... - Manliness.
just gave me an idea of how to disable the formula.
I needed to burn Adam's journals to erase his records of the experiment.
but I knew I was also burning the only real connection I had to the man who had given me life.
and the way he had given it.
thank you for earlier.
I'm just glad it's over.
according to the hard drive, he made a single backup of data.
I think I saw the disc in his safe when I found Sarah's ring.
he'll have moved it by now. Maybe to his apartment.
now you're breaking into his apartment?
if I don't destroy every trace of this formula, he'll just re-create it.
I have to make sure that doesn't happen.
I can't help wishing you'd just taken him up on his offer of freedom.
they're re-starting the experiment.
they're playing God!
and if Cassidy is any indication of the kind of people they are, - I don't want them to have that power. - I understand.
I do. But the deeper in you get, the more it's changing you.
changing me? - You fake Jessi's death.
you're lying; you're sneaking around, breaking laws...
this just isn't you.
at least it's not who you used to be.
thanks for coming with me. - Are you kidding?
being your lookout, breaking into someone's apartment...
it's like the old days. I'd be pissed if you hadn't asked me.
this is it.
I have the keys to Jessi's apartment.
I'll go in there, climb through the air-conditioning ducts, and then drop down into Cassidy's.
or, I could just pick the lock.
don't ask.
isn't that breaking and entering?
it was okay when you were just entering?
let's see what we find.
Cassidy's passport and birth certificate.
in case of a quick getaway, I guess. - He's not using his real name.
it says Michael Cassidy Kingsley.
mother, Grace. Father, unknown.
why does that name sound familiar?
grace Kingsley was in Adam's notebooks.
she's a member of Latnok.
easy, killer. It's just a game.
it's not just a game.
it's our game. Mine and Andy's.
I thought making things explode would make me feel better, but it only reminded me of how much this sucks.
it does suck. Believe me, I know.
Lori didn't move thousands of miles away while you were still both in love and leave you without saying goodbye.
all she did was reject your sorry ass.
I have an idea.
death by porn?
just give me a few minutes. I have to make a call.
if his mother knew Adam, then she must have known Sarah.
I wonder if she knows her son is a killer.
this is everything on the disk.
that's the formula for the fluid. - You found it.
it worked. - What did?
the thermal imaging. That facility is storing a large amount of something at the temperature we were tracking.
let's assume we're right, and the existing formula is there.
I'll go, add your bacteria to the fluid, then get out before anyone knows I was there.
I wish I could go with you.
I do, too.
we should see what else is on the disk before we destroy it.
the pod schematics.
step one. Genome insertion.
step two. Clone development.
clone? I thought they used human embryos.
that's the way it's always been done.
they must be using someone's genetic sequence to create a clone.
7 8 1 2 2 7. - That's impossible.
Latnok isn't planning to gestate babies in those pods.
they're making clones...
of me.
you've got to be kidding me. - Is that even possible?
it never was before. Now with the pods and the formula, the development process is a more regulated environment.
I can't even wrap my head around the breach of scientific ethics.
it's even worse than just cloning.
Jessi and I were in gestation for sixteen years.
that's what allowed our brains to develop the way they did.
without all that time, we'd be just like everyone else.
so in order for them to create more children like you...
they would have to be in the pods for years.
but why just you? Why not both of you?
they think I'm damaged.
I think we've already established how wrong they are.
still, Kyle is special.
it's understandable why they would want more like him.
if I'm special, it's not because of how I came into this world.
it's what happened to me once I was in it.
you took me in.
you loved me like I was one of your own children.
having you in my life... that's what makes me special.
but this, what they're planning, it's robbing someone of their childhood...
their connection to a mother... a family. I can't allow that.
which is why we have to make sure it doesn't happen.
is that mold? - No. Mold is a fungus.
this is a bacterial agent that will compound exponentially when introduced into a live organism.
it'll basically suffocate any nutritional elements growing in the formula, so it won't allow anything to grow.
of course it will.
I have to get going.
just... Be careful.
please.
I'll be home soon.
are you sure you don't need back-up?
we can't risk anyone seeing you until this is all over.
when it is over, what happens with your life?
what do you mean?
we'll destroy the experiment. And then we can focus on Cassidy.
but one day soon, if we're successful, your life will just return to normal.
I'm starting to realize my life can never be normal.
but it would be nice to get back to some type of constant.
does constant mean Amanda?
I don't know what it means.
sorry, Jessi.
I wish I did.
I wish I could understand how I could have feelings for more than one person.
you're saying you have feelings for me?
why would you even have to ask that?
what are you looking for? - Nicole.
Why?
good luck.
what happened? - The lamp blew out.
I'll fix it.
I rock. - Why do you rock?
and why aren't we making me feel any better yet?
maybe this will.
Hi.
Jackie told me how to hijack the car's navigational system and walk Andy through linking up a video camera.
so even though she's on the road in the middle of the country, you get to see your girlfriend.
don't understand that at all, but...
Thanks, man.
really.
you're welcome.
where are you?
some rest stop in North Dakota.
Declan totally hacked into our minivan's GPS. You're lucky we have one.
your moms are lesbians. How could they not?
are they... listening to me right now?
lucky for you, they took my brothers in to pee.
good, because you are in big trouble, young missy.
I know. I totally suck.
you totally do.
how could you not say goodbye?
I chickened out.
I couldn't say goodbye to you.
I still can't.
well, then it doesn't have to be goodbye.
it can be hello with a lot of miles between us.
in that case, hello.
Hi.
you know what? We can say hello every day until I get to see you again.
and then every day after that.
this should only take about 20 minutes.
just need to cable the system and run a quick diagnostic.
no problem.
I imagine you're not dropping off another lasagna.
I'll come back later. - Sorry. But you can't leave.
Why? - Because you've seen me.
not following. - I'm supposed to be missing and if you tell your new boyfriend that I'm not, you'll ruin everything.
he's not my boyfriend. He's not anything anymore.
I told Kyle I'd stay away from him, but he still has all that stuff about him in his dorm room.
why didn't you just take it? - I don't know.
because that would be stealing. - But Nate stole it in the first place.
I guess it just didn't occur to me, all right?
I'm not as smart as you. - That's true.
I just came to say that Nate's working until ten tonight, so if Kyle wants to get into the room, he can.
Kyle's not home. - Then you do it.
I can't go anywhere. - You still haven't explained that.
and I don't plan on it.
look, unfortunately, you're gonna have to do it.
do what? Break into his room and steal his files?
I was thinking firebomb, but okay.
almost done. It's just...
you don't have to watch.
unless you just like... lurking.
can you hear me? - Yeah, I can hear you.
I'm going to ghost his system.
so, basically it'll be like I'm sitting right where you are.
less chance for operator error.
okay. Open up the systems file.
I need you to get his IP address.
if you know... - I know what that is.
save the sarcasm.
type it into the "share host" box down at the bottom.
and change all the settings to "allow."
perfect.
there's a lot of stuff here Nate's been collecting.
about Kyle?
see for yourself.
I've wanted to know his secrets for so long...
here it all is.
Yeah, well take a good look.
no. When he's ready to tell me, then it'll mean something.
for now, this is just weird.
always the good girl.
not all of us can be as wild as you, Jessi.
apparently, you can.
what's wrong?
this is Cassidy.
I caught Kyle's girlfriends going through my stuff.
girlfriends? - Amanda and Jessi.
Jessi. That's impossible. She's... missing.
well, if she was, she isn't anymore.
find out what they know.
shut it down. Mr. Cassidy wants everyone out of here.
I haven't finished yet. - We have orders.
we need to check the perimeter.
what are you doing?
what is this?
a bacteria.
a bacteria? Why would you... - Mark. We don't have much time.
do you have any idea what you've been helping Cassidy do?
computerized in-vitro gestational chambers.
for women who can't give birth naturally.
I wish that's what it was.
what are you talking about? - Cassidy has been using you.
Latnok is not what they say they are. And that I need your help.
I need you to trust me.
please.
I'll distract them.
just do what you need to do and get out.
Hello?
you're very anxious, for someone who's looking for a dead girl.
I told you, I didn't see anything. - I wish I could believe that.
I really do.
why did you do that? - I thought you could use the help.
we have to get the files and get moving.
he's not gonna be out for very long. - Why not?
because you don't hit hard enough.
better?
where are they? What did you do?
relax.
they're on their way to the Rack.
to meet you, actually.
I may not be a genius, but I know how to clone a cell phone.
speaking of, you've put me in quite a bind with your little tricks.
Latnok's gonna think I failed them.
failed them? Or failed her?
what? - You know what I'm talking about.
so you found out about my mum.
you know, if she had her way, you wouldn't still be living this life of yours.
Latnok would have complete control over you, and believe me, it's only a matter of time before she figures out how to get what she wants.
I was going to convince her to let you go.
all because I thought you saved my life.
who knew what a clever little liar you would be?
I had no choice.
we all have choices. Like how I am choosing to forgive you for what you've done and give you a chance to fix it.
then no one needs be any the wiser.
even if I knew how to do that, I wouldn't.
Oh, you know.
it's all up there in that head of yours.
forgot about that, didn't you?
I can think of a few people who probably haven't.
but they went about it the wrong way in the past.
anyone with a brain knows there's only one way to get you to cooperate.
you figured out what I did to get rid of Sarah.
so you know what I'm willing to do to get what I want.
we're okay. Nate's still out cold.
that ring... looks a lot like the one Kyle wears around his neck.
Nate stole it from Cassidy.
it belonged to my mother.
so I guess you kind of helped me find it.
and you saved me, so...
I guess we're even?
look, I know we've never really gotten along, but...
I don't know.
I feel like we might be a little bit closer than before.
so I think it's only fair that I tell you...
tell me what?
I'm going to tell Kyle I want him back.
you really have the nerve to say that?
after everything that happened tonight?
like I said, fair warning.
you deserve it.
you're a lot braver than I thought.
Origin...?
what is it?
I don't believe it.
you still wear Adam's Latnok ring.
how awfully sentimental. And lucky for me.
why are you doing this? - Because that is what they want.
that's what she wants.
and if you try to stop me,
I'm just gonna have to keep hurting you.
then,
I'm gonna hurt Jessi...
until she wishes she had really died.
and then, just when you think it couldn't get any worse,
I'll hurt everybody that ever mattered to you.
starting with Amanda.
how you feelin' about that, mate?
Nicole had been right when she said she didn't recognize the person I had become.
the person I had been before would have never done this...
you won't do it. - What makes you so sure?
because Grace Kingsley, my mother...
what about her?
she's your mother, too.
I'm your brother.
what are you doing? -I'm keeping a list: What makes Kyle an alien.
he's this super brain with amnesia. He barely knows what you're saying sometimes, but does calculus like it's two plus two.
I'm telling ya, Kyle is not human.
you don't...you don't have a belly button. -No.
why not? -I don't know.
anyway, I should apologize. -I screw up all the time. Maybe it's your turn.
do they have any suspects? -No. Not yet.
does this mean anything to you? -No.
Stephen, I think someone's breaking in.
this is Tom from our security company. -Hello, sir.
you just happened to be driving by? -Yeah. It's a lucky thing, huh?
Thanks, man. It's pretty wet out there.
Whew! You're Kyle, right?
the amnesia guy? -Yeah.
you broke the window at my party. My dad had an aneurysm over that one.
sorry. -He has aneurysms over everything.
so, whatever. It's cool.
you mind?
you know, Lori's sleeping.
well, yeah. It's pretty late.
I need a place to crash.
I know it wasn't too smart to climb in through a window in the rain.
you're bleeding.
crap. Sorry. -It's okay, but what happened to you?
it's a long story. It's too boring.
Hey, you got an extra blanket or something? I'll crash on your floor.
what is this place? -My bedroom.
Where's the bed?
you sleep in a tub? -Yeah.
Trager said you were a head case.
I mean, not like rudely.
whatever. It's cool.
the rain should let up by morning.
actually, it won't let up until 2: 27 tomorrow afternoon.
Yeah. Whatever.
tell me you're joking. -No. He's right in here.
this is so not good. What are you doing here?
I got a fight with my dad. Needed a place to crash.
if my parents find you, I am dead. And that is nothing compared to what my dad will do to you.
relax, Trager.
no. They will never believe that you weren't in my room.
the one time I'm not actually doing anything wrong?
today, of all days?
what did you do to your head?
slipped on some wet leaves.
drink much?
I can just sneak out. They'll never even know I was here.
they better not.
just don't make a sound.
Oh, man! You're up too early!
I thought I'd have at least another half hour to get breakfast ready.
guess I'm turning over a new leaf. -Happy birthday, honey.
Oh! Thanks, Mom.
I love you. -Oh, I know.
I love you, too.
good morning.
it's nice to meet you, Mr. Trager.
I'm Declan McDunaugh.
I just stopped by to wish Lori a happy birthday.
Declan, huh? Well, it's nice to finally meet you.
do I smell pancakes?
so, what happened to your head?
went up for a dunk on the court and landed the wrong way.
you play ball? -Shooting gun.
cool. More pancakes? -Oh, thanks.
you make a great blueberry pancake, Mrs. Trager.
they're Lori's favorite. I make them every year to celebrate her birthday.
because we're so happy she was born.
I'm ignoring you.
good move.
if your birthday means that you're one year older,
doesn't that mean we're celebrating one year closer to death?
well, guess that's one way to look at it.
I think I just lost my appetite.
don't worry, Lori. The average lifespan for the American woman is 79. 2 years.
if you were Japanese, you would have a few more years, but it's still not so bad.
whose idea was it to let him read the encyclopedia?
Hey, we should bring out Lori's baby pictures,
reminisce over the awkward years.
at least I'm out of mine.
birthdays. Baby pictures. Blueberry pancakes.
they were talking about memories and traditions, but I had none of my own.
Kyle, everything okay?
I'm fine.
seems like it will never end, doesn't it?
3 more hours.
you think?
you know.
it's easy for me to process data from global weather satellites.
I just can't figure out why the rain triggers nightmares.
are you having bad dreams? -Last night.
what was it about?
I'm not sure.
well, don't dismiss it. Every piece of information from your head counts.
and dreams are a reflection of what's going on in our subconscious.
where memories are stored. -Exactly.
the brain is a powerful tool--especially yours.
and yet it can't tell me something as simple as my own birthday.
well, that's something we'll fire out together.
the science of weather came easily to me.
it was numbers, data, and patterns.
what I couldn't figure out, no matter how hard I tried, was me.
Where's Declan?
geeking out with Josh.
put a guy in front of a video game, and there goes half his personality.
well, try growing up in the Pink Floyd era and replace video games with pot.
it's so tedious.
you're baking? -I bake.
you make.
it's a special occasion, okay? Cut me some slack.
okay. I'm just saying you don't have to bake a cake for me.
well, birthdays are all about cake.
I guess I'm just not feeling the birthday thing.
but you love your birthday.
not this year.
so Kyle's just bummed out because he knows the aliens are on their way back to get him.
it's the rain.
they travel in lightning bolts, like in War of the Worlds.
cool it, Josh.
you got a better theory?
Oh, ax guy in the corner. Get him!
Oh, great. It's spreading.
Hey, hon.
did you know Lori has decided to hate her birthday?
does that mean we still have to suck up to her?
Oh, 'cause you were doing such a good job.
probably because she's in a fight with Hillary.
she's in a fight with Hillary?
Hey, Kyle, come on in. We'll play teams.
Kyle, what's wrong?
is this from your dream? -I think it's a memory.
you saw him in your dream last night?
and then again earlier, like a flash.
but you don't recognize his face?
no. He just popped into my head.
but I checked the weather archives.
the last major storm we had was the night before I woke up in the woods.
maybe this is a memory from then.
it's definitely a possibility.
no, I'm tired of possibilities. I need something to be real.
well, that's the problem with amnesia.
your mind only unlocks information when it's ready.
but there are other methods-- hypnosis, drugs.
you've been studying. -I need to understand myself.
I get it, Kyle. I do.
and I promise you, if I believe there's a viable alternative to the wait-and-see method, I'll give it a shot.
but those kinds of aggressive therapies can work against you.
you just had what may have been your first memory.
I don't want to risk a setback. Can you trust me on this?
the power line's down.
what are you doing?
Tom.
sorry to startle you, Mr. Trager. There's a bunch of houses in the neighborhood that have lost power.
I'm just doing the rounds, making sure everybody's okay.
well, I'm really glad you're here.
our foster son Kyle drew a picture of someone staring in at him from the window.
at first we thought it was his imagination, but now I'm not so sure.
what if it's the same person that broke into the house last week?
you said something about that he drew a picture? -Yeah.
I should probably look at that.
all right. It's inside. -Yeah. Let's do that.
I hear you're anti-birthday.
word travels fast.
my last birthday, my dad couldn't be bothered to be in town,
so I raided the liquor cabinet in protest.
at least you got blueberry pancakes.
your favorite.
parents like me. What can I say?
seriously, what's your deal?
I'm just feeling particularly friendless right now.
makes celebrating another year of life sort of bleak.
I'm your friend...kind of, I think.
Yeah. After you duped me into losing my virginity?
I didn't dupe you. -Please. Water, bridge.
so, what really happened to your head?
seems like whoever asks gets a different story.
I told you, I fell.
before or after your fight with your dad?
can we drop this, please?
you know, my mom's a therapist. I mean, you could
Trager, it's no big deal. Seriously.
no scandalous family drama, no horrible tales of abuse.
let it go. I'm fine.
door!
the power's out at my house, and I didn't want to be home alone, so I thought I'd come over here.
Where's Charlie? -At his house.
why didn't you go over there?
I guess I just wanted to come over here.
Josh said you remembered something.
I still don't know what it means.
well, it'll come back to you.
I'm beginning to wonder if it will.
I think you should get out of the tub. You're wallowing.
to indulge oneself immoderately, as in wallowing in self-pity.
I'm wallowing.
it's depressing.
what are you doing? -I'm gonna wallow with you.
this is strange. -Yep.
here it is.
that's a... That's a lot of detail.
Yeah. You recognize him?
no. No. I've never seen him before.
did Kyle say when he saw him?
no. He was pretty spooked by the whole thing. He didn't say much.
okay. Uh... I'll circula it at the security company,
and I'll pass it over to the police and maybe they can I. D. him.
great. Thanks. I really appreciate it.
no problem. Just doing my job.
did you give him the picture? -Yeah.
poor Kyle. He was so sure it was a memory and not a dream.
I wish it was.
I don't like the idea of someone trying to break into our house.
it's strange that both times somebody tried to get into Kyle's room.
do you ever wonder if Kyle-- -What?
no. No, it's ridiculous.
after everything we've witnessed, nothing is ridiculous.
no one's reported him missing,
and he's capable of doing things that no normal child or no normal human being should be capable of.
I'm not saying that I believe in Josh's crazy theories, but...
But?
maybe he's not missing for a reason.
maybe there's someone out there that knows exactly where he is.
maybe they're watching him.
you mean like little green men?
no. No, but, you know, with all of this, it's so crazy.
it just kind of makes you wonder.
yes? -We've got a problem.
he's starting to remember.
board games?
well, anything's better than sitting around dodging real conversation.
you went in my room? -Get over it.
mystic Vision? I don't think so.
Yeah. We don't want to play that.
what is it? -It's a Ouija board.
you ask it questions and supposedly the spirits spell out answers.
when in reality, it's usually some idiot moving the pointer around.
well, we should do something. This rain's not letting up anytime soon.
well, actually, it's letting up in 32 minutes, according to KZRE weather over here.
not anymore. The wind shifted.
I bet did. -Let's play.
it's totally fake, Kyle.
I don't care.
No! Seriously, find another game.
Josh!
looks like the spirits are total pervs.
one word, dude--internet.
how do we start?
yeah?
I'm hoping you have a plan.
are you still there?
you ought to take an hour to stop the family from asking any more questions.
good.
because if his memories get any clearer, the family's gonna become a problem.
I'll take care of it.
okay. I'll go first.
who is the biggest queen bee bitch at Beachwood High?
R..."Josh!
what can I say? The spirits speak the truth.
okay. My turn.
how badly am I going to destroy Declan's high score once the electricity comes back on?
no spirit can help you with that, junior. You're toast.
can I go next? -Knock yourself out.
when's my birthday?
Kyle, you know this is just a game.
for 12-year-olds.
Hey, if anyone can get a Ouiji board to work, it's him.
just concentrate, Kyle.
I don't--I don't think...
who's moving the pointer?
what does it mean? -7-8-1-2-2-7.
you had to have been pushing it. -Spelling out your alien birthday?
I wasn't.
well, you don't think you were. -I wasn't.
what is that?
a Kyle file.
I've documented every out-of-the-ordinary event and unusual behavior ever since we got him.
Made...contact...with...spirit...world.
whoa, buddy! This is classified.
this is ridiculous. He's not an alien.
he's not even a good weatherman.
the rain? It stopped.
this doesn't make any sense.
neither do any of the Chicken Little conspiracy theories Josh has been spouting.
you guys aren't seriously buying any of this?
Kyle isn't supernatural.
he's just some kid with no memory and annoying accurate knowledge of the encyclopedia.
you don't know that. -It's just a game.
there's no such thing as spirits or ghosts.
when you're dead, you're dead.
buried, rotting. -Declan, shut up.
no. It's okay. -No, it's not okay.
Oh, God. Your dad. I'm sorry.
there was a sudden drop in the barometric pressure.
the crackling rise of static electricity in the air,
and the subtle smell of ozone.
get back inside, now!
what the hell are you talking about? -Just come on!
that was weird. -What was that?
nothing. It was nothing.
Hallelujah! Ready to get your ass kicked?
you wish.
so, how's your day going?
it's a fiesta.
Kyle channeled a supernatural dimension. -What?
the Ouija board. It spelled out some weird number for him.
he was totally pushing it.
well, of course he was, but he may not realize he was doing it, in which case, maybe it's another memory trying to claw its way out.
did he say he knew what the number meant?
of course not. That would be too easy.
well, I have to talk to him about it.
he asked it when his birthday was.
Yeah. He's having a really hard time with that today.
everyone's weird today--even Declan, who's usually dependably unweird.
so, what's going on with him?
I don't know. He won't talk to me.
and I haven't mastered the art of shrinking like you have.
well, sometimes the easiest way to get somebody to open up is to just be there for them without judgment when they're ready to spill.
Yeah. See, that's the problem. I live for judgment.
you and Declan definitely seem to be getting closer.
Ah, I guess.
I guess you probably feel that you're ready for more.
physically, I mean.
are you shrinking me right now?
shrinking, moming, you know. Whatever works.
stick to baking. It's less mortifying.
Oh, you know, life can be mortifying sometimes.
and trust me, sometimes sex can be, too.
that's a strain from the usual "when 2 people love each her, they make beautiful magic" script.
well, that's true, too.
it's just that it doesn't always happen that way, especially if you rush into things.
you're right.
I am? -I'm not ready.
What'd you find?
9, 734 hits for 7-8-1-2-2-7.
try "7-8-1-2-2-7" and "alien.
that's not funny.
how about "freaky meteorologist"?
try "7-8-1-2-2-7 birthday.
nothing.
doesn't matter. I've got the whole thing figured out.
how?
you sure you can handle it?
my theory is, you're an alien-human hybrid.
the meta-geeks who created you put you here to be their lab rat.
maybe he's here to check the climate for its inhabitability?
Yeah. That would explain the weather thing. -Stop.
seriously, they're watching you interact with us humans, taking notes,
so they can wipe us out and replace us with a master race of hybrid freaks.
then, when they've done enough recon, they'll beam down and take you away.
please stop. -Josh, I don't think you should
no, it's okay. Because here's the beauty of it
it's totally out of our hands, and there's nothing we can do to change it.
so you just gotta go with the flow, you know? -Josh!
I don't want to hear any more!
how is this supposed to make me feel?
searches for alien mothership"?
sleeps in the bathtub"?
memorizes the encyclopedia.
predicts lightning.
this is fun for you?
everyone around here gets a kick out of it, but this notebook...
this is the only thing I know about my entire life!
Kyle-- -Mom, I didn't
I need you to go upstairs. Please. All of you.
No! I can't feel like this anymore!
I don't want to be this freak in Josh's notebook. I need to know who I am.
Kyle, I want you to listen to something, okay?
come on. Sit down.
just forget about everything else that you're feeling right now.
and just listen to the sound of my voice.
now, find the rhythm of the other sounds in the room.
listen to the water dripping off the gutter.
breathe into that sound.
let it fill you up.
let your mind and your heartbeat connect to it.
good.
it's all gonna be okay.
I am the scum of the earth.
you're not scum.
maybe, like, algae.
nobody knew how much that stuff bugged him.
here I am today, whining because I'm not psyched about the way my life has turned out.
and he's wishing he could remember the things he regrets.
I've been upset about things that have happened to me in the past, but at least I have one, you know?
he's just this total blank.
it doesn't sound so bad to me today.
but it feels bad. Kyle feels bad.
it sucks.
come on in, Tom.
I've got some information about your intruder.
hi there.
How're you doing?
I know you.
well, you probably recognize me from patrolling the neighborhood.
you said you had some news? -Yeah.
according to the police, there was a hit-and-run in the neighborhood around 2 a. m.
no one was hurt, and it was probably caused by the weather.
and not reckless driving, but one of the drivers fled the scene, which is a crime, so...
why would he be lurking outside our house?
who was lurking outside our house?
well, we didn't want to worry you, Kyle, but we found some blood on the sill outside your window.
we think that man from your drawing must have actually been at your window.
hit-and-run?
in my room, now.
okay. I panicked.
I was on my way home, it was really hard to see, and I skidded and hit another car.
I freaked out and drove off.
the light, it was on in Kyle's room, and he let me in.
I couldn't go home. My dad would have murdered me.
I don't get you. Every time I think you're a good guy, you do something to completely annihilate yrself!
you think I don't know that?
you can't honestly believe that I don't recognize I'm a total disaster of a person.
I'm sorry.
I'm judging.
I get mad, and that's what I do.
look, I know we've had a lot of back and forth and...
played a lot of idiot games with each other, but you've been a really good friend to me lately.
and if you need someone to be that for you, I'm here.
that's what I want you to know.
what do I do now?
depends on which guy you want to be.
I have to turn myself in.
I'm so dead.
I'll visit you at county.
you don't really think-- -No. You'll be fine.
and it's the right thing to do, so you can go home and pat yourself on the back for not being totally unredeemable.
this friendship thing might work out okay, huh, Trager?
sure, McDunaugh.
spring cleaning?
I don't want to be reminded of what I can't remember.
see, I think you've got this all wrong.
you do?
Yeah. You may not have anything to hold onto right now,
but maybe tomorrow, there'll be a new memory.
and the day after that, another one.
and soon, you'll be drowning in them.
maybe.
but see, the rest of us.
as we grow up, our memories get dimmer.
and we try anything we can to stop them from disappearing completely.
if you ask me, you got the better deal.
thank you.
for what?
for making me feel better.
you make me feel like there's hope.
everyone needs hope.
it's what gets us through the rough spots.
will you tell me about him?
who? -Your dad.
sure.
but not here.
in here.
wallow Central.
first off, he was nothing like my mother.
but she was fferent around him. I mean, it was impossible not to be...
lighter, happier.
I remember this one time, he took me to get my ears pierced...
so, Kyle doesn't have a serial stalker.
or little green men watching over him.
just a teenage boy, afraid to tell his dad what he did.
Yeah. By the way, Lori's not a virgin anymore.
you segue to that?
thought I'd rip the bandage off quickly.
did she tell you? -No. Of course not.
but I was talking to her about not being ready for sex yet, and she agreed with me.
Oh! Man, I am not ready for this!
it's Declan.
that car-wrecking, home-invading
Stephen! -I'm gonna kill him.
you slept with Shelly Peterson when you weren't much older than Josh.
you are not allowed to use something I said after 10 tequila shots on our honeymoon against me.
did it screw you up for life?
that's not fair. It's different for girls.
isn't it? -I think she's fine.
you know, talking to her earlier, there's something there, like...
I don't know. Whatever she's experienced has made her more together.
she's growing up.
we don't have to worry about Josh, do we?
Josh still stashes porn in his board games.
he's not up to being anywhere close to being sexually active.
Hey, if Declan was the person at the window, who's the man in Kyle's drawings?
the police station's gonna be a party compared to what I got coming to me at home.
well, here's one from the Parental Manipulation Handbook
just apologize, cry a little, throw out a few self-loathing comments.
he'll end up trying to make you feel better.
you know what you said earlier about me duping you into having sex?
you know, it's really not a big deal.
it is.
you should know that no matter what Hillary said to give me the push.
she made me realize I was about to lose you.
that's why I asked you out.
because I wanted to.
thank you for that.
it's a shame that it sucked so bad.
goodbye.
happy birthday, Lori.
how are you feeling?
better.
Lori told me about the number you discovered.
you want to talk about it?
tomorrow.
can I help? -Sure.
I'll go gather everybody.
I'm not mad at you.
thank God.
look, if you're gonna be part of this family, you've got to understand all the traditions.
okay.
here we go.
No! Wait, wait!
I was thinking, if it's okay with Kyle.
I want to share my birthday with you.
at least until you remember when your real birthday is.
thank you.
come here. You can help me blow out the candles and make a wish.
he could wish to age better than Lori.
do you know what you're gonna wish for? Don't say it out loud or it won't come true.
it's another birthday tradition.
that doesn't make any sense.
you're right. Screw it. What do you wish for?
I think I'll keep with the tradition.
okay. Let's do it.
Josh! It never gets old, does it?
with a flash of the camera, the Tragers gave me the first page of my history.
it may not go back as far as Lori's or Josh's.
but I finally have a beginning.
and then my birthday wish came true.
it made me feel like anything, anything was possible.
what does the forecast say?
sunny, in the 60s through Tuesday.
rain.
damn.
Kyle, what's wrong?
that's him.
detective, there's a Nicole Trager on the phone for you.
put her through. -Yes, sir.
Mrs. Trager, what can we do for you?
[Nicole] Is this from your dream?
I think it's a memory.
Hi.
I know you.
well, you probably recognize me from patrolling the neighborhood.
we got a problem. He's starting to remember.
you've been a really good friend to me lately.
and if you need someone to be that for you...
I'm here.
do you think you've ever seen it before?
no.
[Josh] If anyone could get a Ouija board to work, it's him.
what does it mean?
[Nicole] Kyle, what's wrong?
police have identified the remains found last month as William Kern
that's him.
...a professor of biochemistry at the University of Washington.
[Nicole] Maybe Professor Kern was his teacher, and Kyle witnessed his murder.
you're drawing conclusions before there's any real evidence.
[Nicole] Kyle drew that picture before he knew Kern's was missing.
you can't tell me that's a coincidence.
Kyle, hypnosis relaxes you.
it allows you to focus very deeply.
Dr. Cassidy has helped some of my patients make sense of their dreams.
and by tapping into your subconscious, hypnosis can unlock memories you've lost or suppressed.
what are we waiting for?
Kyle, you're walking down the steps of a long staircase, and with each step, you find yourself relaxing more and more, letting every muscle relax.
the staircase winds around...
Kyle, where are you now?
in a car.
it's raining.
whose car is it?
I don't know.
are you alone?
a man. Professor Kern.
he's looking in.
he's hurting him!
who, Kyle?
who hurt Professor Kern?
I want you to leave that place now.
tell me what happened before.
before?
before you were in the car in the rain.
tell me what you remember.
go deeper now, Kyle.
you're at another door.
open it and look inside at your past.
there are images and sounds.
describe them to me.
Kyle, what do you remember?
what is that?
I don't know.
jacob, take him out of it.
Kyle, go back to the door and up the stairs.
when I snap my fingers, you'll be safe in this room.
bring him out now.
one, two, three.
I've never come across anyone like him.
beyond the images Kyle described from that one night, he couldn't retrieve even one memory.
well, he's blocked.
I told you his amnesia is severe.
Nicole, I think you need to consider another diagnosis.
Kyle shows clear signs of delusions and paranoia.
no, he's not schizophrenic.
I've been treating Kyle for months.
he's sensitive to others, he communicates, participates...
no.
what about his fixation on Professor Kern?
the police have determined there's no connection.
but I still believe there is one.
we just haven't found it yet.
and his fears about a security guard Tom Foss?
that's not paranoia?
I think Tom Foss, as an authority figure, represents someone disturbing from Kyle's past.
and that gibberish. You've never heard that before?
no.
no, but it could be a product of post-traumatic stress disorder.
I mean, Kyle let out a string of nonsense syllables like a...cathartic release.
well, that's as good a guess as any.
in the trance, I approached a door to my past, but the door was locked. I longed for the key for a moment of clear understanding.
but with every detour and dead end, it grew harder to stay optimistic.
two years till we graduate, and my dad's already on me about applying to college.
he's got his checkbook out ready to buy me into the school of my choice.
I think my parents started saving the second I left the womb.
Kyle, what's up?
so how'd it go today?
I guess I shouldn't expect so much.
told ya.
those hypnotists are bogus.
Josh, that door is there for a reason.
it's open.
so, did he make you cluck like a chicken?
get out.
there's one thing I will not miss when I go to college.
you're going to college?
eventually.
Declan here's already being recruited.
a couple of scouts saw me play from Whitman and "U-Dub."
university of Washington.
the coach keeps calling, so I thought I'd drive over and check it out tomorrow.
take me with you.
dude, I thought you were done playing basketball.
the University of Washington, that's where Professor Kern taught.
the guy who's skeleton they found in the woods.
if you wanna come, Kyle, I'm fine with it.
Kyle, you can't drive to U-Dub with Declan, my parents won't let you.
you haven't exactly established yourself as the most trustworthy person.
that really hurts.
but I have to go.
if I knew Professor Kern, and that's where he taught, someone there might know who I am.
Kyle, if my mom hears that you wanna go to U-Dub...
she wants me to figure things out.
that doesn't include snooping around about some dead professor.
I mean, you should have seen Kyle's reaction.
the anxiety when he started talking about Tom Foss as if he was really re-living the experience.
And...what? Even under hypnosis there's still no clue why Kyle had those flashes about him?
no. And they're so vivid.
I know that Foss is just a replacement for someone, but still, it makes Kyle anxious to have him around.
well, you're not gonna have to worry about that anymore.
I called Palisades Security today.
you got him fired?
not quite, but they agreed to take him off our detail.
I guess a transfer to Alaska was out of the question, but still, it's a relief. Thank you.
Aw, please. Not near my food.
Hey.
Hey.
Kyle, sorry it didn't work out this morning.
it was worth a try.
I'm glad you're not discouraged.
I think Kyle needs a break from all this stuff.
Declan's checking out Whitman tomorrow, and I thought I'd go, and Kyle's welcome to come.
I thought Declan was going-- To invite you himself?
he meant to, so I'm asking you for him.
why are you being so nice to him?
Yes, why are you?
God, you make it sound like I'm this horrible person.
forget it. I don't have to take him.
but I wanna go.
I'd like to see the school.
give him one day there and he'll come back with a diploma.
well, what do you think?
bring me back a Whitman t-shirt?
you wanted to go to U-Dub, didn't you?
I just don't like making up stories for them.
that's why I did it. You can thank me later.
Hey. Ready to roll?
Kyle, once and for all you can find out if those dreams that you're having are real.
let's go [sighs] Welcome to U-Dub.
does anything look familiar?
no. Not yet.
Mrs. Trager. Hi.
hello.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I just came by to make sure that everything is okay.
everything's fine.
well, I guess I mean...
I know that you folks requested to have my detail switched, and I just wanted to make sure I hadn't done anything to... upset you.
we just felt that it wasn't a good match here.
I'm sorry to hear that...
because I have to say that...
uh, I admire you, Mrs. Trager. I do.
the way that you balance your career with your family, and a foster child on top of that.
it's a lot to handle. I really respect that.
so even though I'm not on your watch anymore,
I just want you to know that...
you can call on me if you ever need anything.
thank you.
you're welcome. Goodbye.
check it out. We're in college, Trager.
why do I feel like I have high school written all over me.
Kyle, where are you going?
to the science building.
hang on, where's the gym?
take that path, then left at the commons and straight on for an eighth of a mile.
you already memorized the campus?
you're like a walking navi system.
so let's hook up in a couple of hours by the student union.
sure.
think you can find it?
this is it.
can I help you?
Hi. I'm Lori Trager. This is Kyle.
hello.
we were told this is Professor Kern's office.
it was.
well, we think Kyle might have known the professor.
may have?
I'm not sure if I did.
Kyle has amnesia. Seriously.
and one of the few people he seems to remember is Professor Kern.
Uh-huh.
I know this all sounds kind of "out there,"
but we were hoping being here might help Kyle remember.
do you know me?
I'm sorry. No.
I'm Anna Manfreddy, I'm
I was Professor Kern's research assistant.
can I ask what exactly was he researching?
essentially, he was interested in maximizing brainpower.
professor Kern developed theories and exercises covering areas of creative thinking, problem-solving, memory, logical thought and mental agility.
I've done some reading.
the thing is, Kyle is smart.
like, Einstein-smart.
he had an MRI and it showed a really high level of brain activity.
so, we were thinking maybe Kyle worked with the professor, which could explain
no. I did all of Professor Kern's testing.
I would've known if Kyle were involved in his research.
but I had to be. There has to be a connection.
it's the only thing that makes sense.
sorry. Test me now.
I'll take all of his tests and you'll see.
all right. Thanks. I appreciate it.
Uh-oh. This can't be good.
[Sighs] Well, actually, that was good news.
that was Detective Breen.
I asked him to run a background check on Foss and it came up clean.
I should never have told you.
listen, Nicole, I had him taken off our watch and then he shows up at the door to question you about it.
but he wasn't hostile.
it was more like...concern.
he can keep his concern. I don't want him coming around.
I admit he makes me uncomfortable, but remember, he's never actually done anything wrong.
well, Kyle's having nightmares about him and he's got good instincts, so if Foss spooks him, then that's reason enough for me.
heads up!
sweet catch.
Thanks.
throw could use some work.
I skipped Intro to "Frisbee."
that's too bad. I happen to teach that class.
I'm Wes, by the way.
Lori. You go here?
just visiting.
what do you think so far?
Hey.
Hey, Declan. This is Wes.
what's up. How's it going?
well, I should get back to the game.
so, how'd it go with Kyle?
He's...extraordinary.
Kyle's results are so far beyond the normal range.
I showed him 100 images in 60 seconds.
he was able to remember all 100 of them.
not bad for a guy with no memory.
you see how smart he is.
don't you think it's possible he worked with Professor Kern?
I suppose, but William would've shared these results.
his best test case, even with repeated proactive could only identify 37 images.
what is he looking at?
they're pictures and awards of students and faculty.
what is it?
there... It's you.
impossible. Check the date.
1985?
[Josh] How's Whitman? Kick you out yet?
Josh, just put mom or dad on.
you don't really think you can get in there, do you?
your grades are lame.
you've got no after school activities, and there's really nothing special about you.
what's the matter with you? Hello.
Hey, Dad. Listen, we're having such a cool time, could we crash here and come home tomorrow?
you want to spend the night? I-I don't think so.
they have all these great activities for prospective freshmen.
activities involving beer kegs and bongs?
no. God, Dad. I thought you'd be happy.
I can't even apply for a year and I'm already psyched about going to college.
well, where are you gonna sleep?
they have accommodations for us.
come on, Kyle's here. It's guaranteed G-rated.
we're all really into it.
all right. Just be careful and keep your cell phone on.
I will. And thank you.
all right.
it had to be done. if we told them the truth, they'd flip out and make us come home.
Kyle, there's no way we can leave here now.
we just saw a picture of you in 1985.
that wasn't me.
then it's your long-lost twin.
I'm not in my 40's.
look, Anna snagged us a room, my parents are cool, do you want to find out who that man is or not?
[Kyle] Seeing that picture,
I felt that I was getting close to the truth, and it scared me.
Absolutely.
what is that?
sorry. It's one of my patients.
was it Kyle?
Whoa! That must be his alien voice.
sort of a mix between human and dolphin.
out.
come on. It's like he's talking at the wrong speed.
how weird was that, seeing that picture?
I mean, think about it. You and that guy could be related.
I haven't stopped thinking about it.
if Josh were here, he'd have some sort of time-traveler theory with you jumping through portals in space.
which you didn't, did you?
[Sighs] It's like there's this whole other world going on.
there really is life after high school.
Yeah, I've got coaches all across the country begging me to play for them.
Yeah, but they don't have what U-Dub has.
what's that? Me.
I take it back. It is high school all over again.
Hey, Lori. Hey.
I guess you don't recognize me without my frisbee.
no, I-I do. Wes, right?
so how long's this trip of yours gonna last?
just till tomorrow.
then we should make the most of it.
Oh, I--Kyle, do you wanna look around?
you go. I'll see you later.
you sure?
so, do you wanna see my room?
actually, I'm here with someone.
then why am I talking to you?
okay, that's the number Kyle pointed out on the Ouija board.
but the rest...
same pattern, over and over again.
some sort of code.
I can't make any sense of it.
par for the course with Kyle.
play it back again, I want to take it down.
Kyle. I've been looking for you.
are you okay?
it's just a lot to take in.
Oh. New places are hard for me, too.
the problem is: I don't know if it is a new place, or somewhere I've been before.
can't imagine.
I'm sure when the time is right, everything will become clear to you.
william would have been so excited to meet you.
you miss him.
we were...
good friends.
I'm sorry about what happened.
there is such brutality in this world.
still, you are an inspiration.
you somehow achieved William's dream:
to possess a mind as fast as a computer.
how does it make you feel?
different.
but just think of all that you can accomplish.
like doing math problems?
solving equations and puzzles?
that's not important.
what is?
I wanna know who I am.
so what do you want to study?
I haven't really thought about it.
what interests you?
I don't know. Art.
I can see that. Yeah?
Absolutely.
I hate museums. I don't get art at all.
I just said it to have something to say.
I bet that you have a lot to say, Lori, you just haven't found the right person to listen.
I know that sounded like a line.
totally.
well, I meant it, though. Is it true?
Hey, are you still up?
hard to sleep.
miss your tub?
she's still out, huh?
I thought she was with you.
no. She was talking to that guy.
if you like Lori, why don't you tell her?
she knows that I like her.
take your own advice.
I haven't seen you pour your heart out to Amanda.
I picked up on it.
no worries. I don't think she and Charlie have.
must kill you to see them together.
I want her to be happy.
I would be in there so fast.
Charlie's your friend.
look, if you want someone, you gotta give it a shot.
if people are meant to be together, they stay together.
Oh, Kyle.
I know it's early but I couldn't wait.
what happened? I found out his name.
the guy in the photo.
it's Adam Bailen.
does it ring a bell?
no.
excuse me. Sorry.
I just need to grab a towel.
don't be discouraged.
there's someone I want you to meet who might help.
she's a secretary in my department.
Oh, those eyes. Who could ever forget those eyes.
he really looks like him?
very much so.
what was he like?
Adam Bailen was brilliant.
one of the finest graduate students we ever had.
and believe me, I've been here forever, so I know.
Lilly, tell them who he worked with.
professor Kern.
william Kern was like a mentor to him.
they were involved in several projects together.
but it's not just Adam's academic achievements I remember.
it's the way he took the time to ask me about my life.
he was that way with everyone.
his curiosity, his sensitivity.
that's what I miss.
so, to see you here...
do you have an address or a phone number?
there are so many things I'd like to ask him.
Oh, sweetheart. Didn't you know?
you can't ask him anything.
Adam Bailen has been missing for 20 years.
I can't believe they kept all his research.
I know. He must've been really exceptional.
still, I don't think anyone's been through these boxes in 20 years.
sounds about right.
he was so involved in his work, then doesn't show up to school one day.
apparently he disappeared without a trace.
anything I can find out about Adam Bailen is here in these boxes.
take your time.
Hey! I've been waiting for you.
great. You can grab the rest from the car.
no, listen. Those letters and numbers?
I figured it out. They're coordinates.
latitude and longitude.
what do you mean? Like, a location?
near Seattle.
47 degrees, 27 minutes north.
122 degrees, 18 minutes west.
I looked up the spot online on ViewIt Earth.
but here's the thing:
that location is blocked.
blocked? Why?
cause it's a top secret government facility. Josh...
like Area 51. Where they hide all the aliens.
Kyle even talked about it under hypnosis.
how much more proof do you need?
Josh, you shouldn't be listening.
if Kyle's the patient, then why are you talking to Dad about him.
because I'm his foster father.
and I'm his foster brother.
if there's something going on with him, especially something this cool and bizarre,
I think I got a right to know about it.
[Kyle] Reading Adam Bailen's thoughts,
I felt a connection beyond our physical resemblance.
I understood his research.
it seemed that his mind worked like my own.
we had to be related. We had to be.
okay, what's with the attitude.
it's like working with a hostile mute.
I'm just concentrating.
Yeah, Declan. I'm sure you're really fascinated by all these equations and formulas.
wanna tell me what's going on?
look, I know you're psyched pretending you're in college and all, but come on.
you sleep with frisbee boy after one night?
[gasping] Okay. First off, it's none of your business who I sleep with.
and second, it's still none of your business, but I did not have sex with Wes.
right.
God, Declan, we stayed up late talking, then I fell asleep in his room.
this is such a double-standard.
if I gave you a hard time about another girl, you would tell me to piss off.
I wouldn't say "piss off."
you know what I mean.
we're friends, and friends don't guilt each other about who they hang out with.
you're right.
it's all good.
so, what did you two talk about?
it was less that he talked and...
more that he listened.
Kyle, I'm sorry. I don't think there's anything here.
Yes, there is.
Adam Bailen drew it 20 years ago.
hillary just called.
she was surprised to hear you were going to Whitman. Apparently, Declan had plans to go to the University of Washington.
dad...
what's going on? Okay, look, we came up here to help Kyle. I don't care what you were doing. You don't lie to us about where you are.
I'm sorry, but we found out some things, like this grad student who looks exactly like Kyle, except he's been missing since the '80s.
what are you talking about? And the guy drew the symbol that Kyle kept drawing, with this code next to it.
and Kyle figured out its latitude and longitude, like an address.
what are the coordinates?
47. 27 north, 122. 18 west.
it's a spot in the woods right by here.
how'd you know that?
you know Kyle. He's got a map of the universe in his head.
we're gonna go check it out. No, you're not gonna go check it out.
you're gonna get back in that car, and you're gonna drive home immediately.
we can't leave now.
you will leave now. Do you hear me?
I mean it. Okay!
calm down. We're going.
okay. Good-bye.
hillary has such a big mouth.
Oh, man. I forgot I mentioned it to her.
sorry, Kyle. We have to go home.
we can't.
my dad was pissed.
we'll come back another time.
fine.
bathroom break, and then we're leaving.
wait. Where you going'?
I have to get there.
dude, you don't have a car.
I'll find someone to drive me.
you can't do that.
I can't turn back now.
I'm too close.
okay, we'll convince Lori to go.
no. I don't want her to come.
it might be dangerous out there.
because that man Adam Bailen's been missing?
Yeah.
we'll call her and tell her what we're doing and then come back and pick her up.
[Kyle] It's right here.
here?
okay, okay, stop yelling. I cannot believe you did this to me. Do you know how much trouble this gets me in?
we're at the spot. I'll call you later.
don't hang up on me. Don't
Uhh!
sure this is it?
Yes.
all we need is the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion.
never mind.
stay here. There's no way.
I'm going alone.
like hell.
Declan...thanks for driving me, but I have to do this on my own.
I'll be fine.
Uhh!
stop!
what do you want?
[Whispers] Shut up.
why are you following me?
shut up and listen to me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
if I wanted you dead, you'd be dead already.
like you killed Professor Kern?
he's not the man you thought he was. Trust me.
trust you?
everything I did was to protect you.
no.
to keep you safe.
safe from what?
you gotta trust me.
you gotta stop asking questions!
forget about the past!
get on with your life.
because if you don't...
if you don't, you're gonna put yourself and you're gonna put Nicole and you're gonna put Steven and Lori and Josh, that whole family in danger.
what are you talking about?
they'll kill you, Kyle.
they'll kill all of you.
now, get out here. Kyle!
and remember what I told you.
go!
and don't ever come back!
go!!
man. what're you doing?
let's go.
Well...what happened?
what did you see? Nothing.
Kyle, you saw something.
there was nothing there.
I'm sorry I lied to you. I thought it was important for Kyle.
I told you to come straight home.
that was my fault, Mrs. Trager.
please don't be mad at Lori and Declan.
they did it for me.
Kyle, that student who resembled you.
Lori said he's been missing for 20 years and that he drew the logo.
there's no point in pursuing it now.
I mean, what difference does it make to my life here now?
if that's the case, why is that spot blocked on ViewIt Earth?
no reason it should be.
it's just a bunch of trees.
something happened out there in the woods.
no.
I know you're in trouble, Kyle.
I'm gonna tell Lori's parents.
no. You can't do that.
then talk to me.
that man--Tom Foss.
the security guard.
he was out there in the woods.
he wanted me to stop asking questions about my past.
Why?
he said something bad could happen to the Tragers.
so we can't tell anyone or do anything.
just move on and forget all about it.
understand?
can I trust you?
Yes.
what, no good-bye?
you're not mad anymore?
I'm over it.
thanks for taking me, Lori.
told you you'd thank me.
later, bro.
later.
if you dare say, "Later, Trager..."
I wasn't gonna say anything.
all this time, I've been trying to restore my memory.
but I didn't realize that sometimes memories are better left forgotten.
I wanted to know who I was.
but maybe some mysteries are better left unsolved.
from three hours ago.
why are you acting so weird?
Nicole says it's because I like you.
don't you like me?
Yeah, I do.
my dad was notorious for breaking promises.
I don't want to be that kind of father.
you're not; you're a great father.
my sister Jessi, she's been having some problems.
we're hoping that you might be able to sit down with her.
[Jessi] It's a really pretty necklace.
Thanks. It's a remnant from my Declan days.
Jessi, we're leaving.
you can't tell me what to do!
I want to tell you everything.
I'm ready to hear it.
foss did this?
[Kyle narrating] Life is full of regrets.
but no matter how hard you try, you can't change the past.
Lori had been attacked.
no one was sure who did it or why.
and all I could focus on was how I wasn't able to stop it from happening.
Hey.
dad, you have to stop doing this.
and you, do I speak with a British accent?
no.
am I wearing a crown? --No.
then stop guarding my door like I'm Queen freakin" Elizabeth.
sorry.
he's just worried about you.
I gathered.
sweetie, I know you're just trying to be strong, but what happened, it's a lot to deal with.
what happened is I became one with my inner liberal and got hate-crimed for it.
as far as I'm concerned, this is my badge of honor.
how's she doing today?
apparently, better than I am.
when I look at her it breaks my heart.
Yeah, I feel the same way, but we have to keep it together, and make her feel safe and comfortable.
how about whipping up some sympathy pancakes?
what? She likes them and I'm in the mood.
[Sighs] I'll be right down.
me first.
all yours.
[Phone ringing] I hope that's the police with news for Lori.
I already spoke to them.
there are still no leads or eye witnesses.
and since Lori can't identify her attacker, then they're at a dead end.
a Dr. Keel is on the phone.
Dr. Keel?
she's calling from the hospital about a patient:
a William Trager.
who is he?
he's my father.
hello. Yeah, this is his son.
I didn't know Stephen's father lived in town.
how long has he been sick?
I don't know. They haven't spoken in years.
it's complicated.
he had a stroke last night.
looks like he's not going to make it.
I'm so sorry, Stephen.
is there anything I can do to help?
no, there's nothing to do.
I said good-bye to my father years ago.
are things really that bad between them?
I always hoped they'd manage to repair things, but doesn't look like that's going to happen.
[Narrating] Adam Baylin said I would touch the world, but what good is having a gift if I couldn't help the people I loved the most?
you didn't have to come.
I know you told everyone not to, but I want to meet your father.
he's in coma, you know? He can't communicate.
I understand.
been a long time since I've seen him.
this wasn't how I envisioned our next meeting.
would you rather go in alone?
no.
[Woman] Mr. Trager.
yes?
I'm Dr. Keel.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Hi.
so, how's he doing?
well, I'm afraid there's been no improvement.
can he hear us?
this machine monitors his neural patterns.
the readings indicate that he can't.
I'll give you some time with him.
that's probably for the best that he doesn't know I'm here.
do you really think that?
Yeah. I was a big disappointment to him.
he never agreed with how I chose to live my life.
never listened...
never cared.
are you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.
God, how long were you standing there?
six seconds.
I haven't seen you since you threw that hissy fit at the dance.
I got mad at my sister.
remind me never to cross you.
so, what's up?
uh, I have a session with your mom today.
Oh, I get it.
you came by for a damage report.
you look awful.
Wow. Blunt.
does it hurt?
looks worse than it is.
I just hope the cops nail the bastard who did this.
the police?
you know, blue hats, shiny badges?
why would they be involved?
last time I checked the statutes, assault was still a crime.
a crime?
Yeah.
Plus, the creep who did this stole the necklace
Declan gave me and I want it back.
so, are we done with 20 Questions?
I only asked four.
right. Well, you don't want to keep my mom waiting.
what's up, baby?
come on, Declan. Let's move!
come on! Heads up!
come on, baby!
game!
nice shot. Is that all you got?
good job, baby. Did good, bro.
you okay?
I didn't sleep much last night.
how are you doing?
you mean now that I know the whole truth about you?
I'll never look at science class the same, that's for sure.
I know it was a lot to take in.
you can say that again.
but don't.
how's Lori?
she's dealing.
you should stop by. I'm sure she'd appreciate it.
I want to, but what about Foss?
we can't be sure it was him.
the cops cleared everyone who was at The Rack, which can only mean one thing: your boy Foss is guilty.
I just can't imagine he would go so far.
because he's such a model citizen.
the guy's offed how many people that we know about?
so believing he can knock Lori around is not that big a stretch.
I should have seen it coming.
I could have done something to prevent it.
Kyle, the guy's a frickin' psycho.
you're not responsible for what he did.
you haven't heard from him, have you?
not since he left last week.
and I have no idea where to find him.
what are you going to do if he comes back?
I have to figure that out.
meanwhile, you should check on Lori.
at least for now I think it's safe.
[Jessi] Lori seems fine.
well, appearances can be deceiving.
what do you mean?
sometimes people project what they want others to see, even if it's not an accurate representation of who they are.
we can be different than who we appear to be?
are you writing that down?
not exactly.
sometimes I record what you say.
other times, just my thoughts and impressions.
about me?
well, yes.
can I read them?
Jessi, they're confidential.
you know that.
let's talk about Emily.
now, when she insisted that you leave the dance, is that the way she normally behaves when she's upset with you?
I guess.
I know everybody thinks she's so nice, but she's not.
she just...appears to be.
what do you mean?
she's always saying that she's in control...
telling me where to go and who to be with.
sometimes, I'm just really scared around her.
[Narrating] Ever since my trip to the hospital, I felt like I was in a fog.
but as my head cleared, an image appeared in my mind.
I didn't know what it was or why I was drawing it.
I just knew I had to get it out.
[Lori] Dad?
Hey, guys. What's up?
we figured you weren't feeling that great...
want to go to a movie or something?
our treat.
wait, you'll actually be seen at a movie with me?
at a time like this, I'm willing to risk the embarrassment.
so you're really okay, then?
shouldn't I be asking you that?
dad, your father's in the hospital.
my face will heal.
grandpa had a chance to be part of our lives and he chose not to be.
do any of you recognize this?
it's a church, dude.
that's St. Augustine.
how do you know that?
my father belonged to the congregation.
he wanted me and your mom to get married there.
why did you draw this?
I don't know, it just came to me.
I must have seen it recently.
you couldn't have.
this church was torn down years ago.
no St. Augustine in this one, either.
well, he had to have seen it in one of these.
check it out, our first apartment.
Yeah, if you can call a basement sublet with bad plumbing and mice an apartment.
Hey, I loved it.
I did, too. [chuckles]
Oh, you were so beautiful.
I was afraid you were going to wise up at the last minute.
we could have gotten married at the church, you know?
I would have gone along with it.
you remember how he was.
he had to put his stamp on everything.
if I didn't make a stand with our wedding, he would have barked religion at us for the rest of our lives.
instead he just didn't come at all.
I know we both made mistakes.
maybe you should try talking to him.
I know he can't hear you, but saying the words might be enough.
I got nothing to say to him.
not a single picture of the church.
how the hell did Kyle draw this?
my Grandfather sent Kyle the image.
but he's in a coma.
like that's going to stop Kyle?
just when I'm ready to cross "alien" off my list, you pull another stunt and suck me back in.
I don't do stunts.
you know what I mean.
something unexplainable.
it is explainable.
I'm listening.
okay, I can't explain it...yet, but whatever it is, I'm sure there's a logical scientific explanation.
don't be so sure.
maybe it's divine intervention.
boring.
divine intervention?
maybe God wants you to help Stephen make peace with his father.
do you really think that's possible?
with you, anything's possible.
[Gasps] Oh.
I really wish people would stop sneaking up on me.
sorry.
how you doing? Fine.
I never knew there were so many shades of purple.
you're painting your room?
time to change it up in here.
Lori, seriously, are you okay?
did you expect to find me in the fetal position?
I-I wouldn't blame you.
look, some coward jumped me.
I'm not going to let him get the best of me.
well, that's great, but I also think you can let yourself freak out a little.
are you going to Preston's party this week?
thinking about it. Are you?
I'm sure everyone's expecting me to hide, but I'm going.
you su-- Maybe I'll see you there.
I hate hospitals.
they're always so cold.
the colder temperature helps prevent the spread of viruses.
the least they could do is paint the walls, make it feel warmer.
was it difficult to see your father this way?
how did you
Oh, yeah, you're you.
do you think he knows we're here?
the doctor said no.
he can't be sure, right?
I mean if you received a message
but did I?
I want to believe I can do this, but
sometimes things happen that just don't make sense.
you've got to have faith that they're happening for a reason.
Hey. What are you two doing in here?
I know it sounds crazy, but when I drew that church...
what if your father's trying to communicate something through me?
and what, you're here waiting for him to communicate again?
I asked Kyle to try, Mr. Trager.
I thought if your father's reaching out in some way
listen...
I know you two both mean well, but my father had plenty of chances to reach out and make amends.
what if he wants one more chance?
there are no more chances.
at least not for us.
thanks for taking the time.
I know how hard it must be trying to balance work and raise Jessi by yourself.
well, we manage.
still, it must get stressful at times.
Nicole, what are you getting at?
Jessi's expressed some anxiety to me about the way you deal with her.
and I saw the dynamic myself when you showed up at the dance.
the dynamic.
you seem to get very hostile and aggressive.
I asked her not to go, she did anyway.
do you always react that way when she doesn't listen?
you know, I have to say I thought that Jessi would be making more progress by now.
I think she is.
she's finally starting to open up to me, and apparently, that makes you uncomfortable...
and that makes me even more concerned.
there's no reason for concern.
but I think I made a mistake bringing Jessi to you.
I think it's vital that she continue coming.
in fact, if Jessi misses even one appointment,
I won't hesitate to call Social Services.
[flashback] We can be different than who we appear to be.
are you writing that down?
not exactly.
Jessi lacks empathy...
is socially manipulative, and has no remorse.
Hey.
Hi.
sorry it took me so long.
this guy in line changed his order, like, 60 times.
that's a lot of orders.
Yeah.
what's wrong?
what do you mean?
well, I don't think the coffee is what's bothering you.
it's just... I saw Lori earlier.
so?
seeing her all beat up like that...
she's trying to convince herself it's no big deal.
maybe it isn't to her.
how couldn't it be?
this how'd you feel if you were her.
you get attacked and you don't know why or by who.
I guess I never thought about how it'd make her feel.
[Narrating] Adam told me that as my mind developed, new abilities would reveal themselves to me, like holographic memory.
but this was different.
the church wasn't my memory; it was someone else's.
if this was a new ability, why couldn't I control it?
and if it wasn't, how could it be happening at all?
it's my father's living room.
this is incredible.
it's exactly how I remember it.
how did you do this?
I wish I knew.
there's something I want you to see.
[Kyle] You grew up here?
Yeah, sure did.
been a long time since I've been in this house.
nothing has changed.
every night he'd pour himself a glass of Scotch, sit in this chair, and read his bible.
put it ahead of everything, even his family.
is that why you don't like religion?
it's not that I don't like religion.
it's just... that I'm a science guy.
I need hard evidence, proof.
my father, he never understood that.
strange how something meant to bring people together can split so many apart.
I wrote him a letter after the kids were born...
hoping he'd want to be part of our family.
when I came here to give it to him, we had this huge argument.
he tore it up right in front of me.
never even read it.
was that the last time you spoke?
we both said some horrible things to each other.
I have always regretted the way we left it.
so if he's really trying to say something,
I'm ready to listen.
I need to talk to Ballantine, so I'm just going in.
Nicole Trager's threatened to call Social Services on me.
why would she do that?
it's Jessi.
she's been willful and defiant.
she must be complaining about me during her therapy sessions.
she's a computer with a glitch.
bring her in. We'll fix her.
with all due respect, I don't think that that's a solution.
you may have downloaded a history into her brain, but I've been living with that girl.
and she has wants and desires and feelings like any other teenager.
she's not like any other teenager.
but you can't just reboot her every time she acts like one.
ms. Hollander, that's not your concern.
look, I don't think I'm the right person for this assignment.
you know, you won't tell me what we're really doing here, it's taking a lot longer than you led me to believe, and I miss my little
I think it'd be best if I resigned.
you're stressed out.
it's a tough assignment.
and now that you're so familiar with our agenda,
I expect you to see it through.
take a few days to reconsider.
we'd hate to lose you.
brought your bible for you, Dad.
thought you'd want it with you.
what are you doing... exactly?
trying to focus on your father.
anything?
not yet.
Hey, I was just heading out for some coffee.
I thought you might want to come along.
Oh, thanks, I'm already pretty deep into the Lori Trager trifecta.
you have a trifecta?
trashy magazines, nail polish, Oprah reruns.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not here to analyze.
you don't have a shrink speech prepared for this scenario?
I don't have a mom speech prepared for this, either.
I never thought I'd have to see you deal with anything like this.
but I know you'll get through it, and I know you need time, and you should know your dad and I are here for you if you need us.
touching.
what are you doing?
taking my Kyle File digital.
going to go videotape the collage he drew on his wall.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing. How do you think he did that?
I gotta go.
do you know what this means?
you're actually doing it.
you're really communicating with him.
but what's a church and an old room supposed to tell me?
maybe there's more to the message.
I tried and got nothing.
Stephen's finally ready to listen and I'm letting him down.
when my dad was alive, we used to sit in the gardens at Lancaster Park and talk for hours.
he always told me I could do anything if I just believed.
but what if I fail?
you won't.
how can you be so sure?
because I believe in you.
about the dance, it didn't really end the way I'd hoped.
I know.
with Lori and everything.
Yes.
with us, too.
the timing wasn't right.
when will it be?
we'll just know.
what is it?
I don't know what's wrong with me.
nothing's wrong with you; you're just confused.
I lack empathy, I'm socially manipulative, and I have no remorse.
did Nicole tell you that?
I just want things to make sense.
I want to understand why I do the things I do.
you know...
everyone feels that way sometimes.
do you? Sure.
do you remember what Mom used to say about tomorrow?
mom? - Yeah.
she said, "Tomorrow's a clean slate, "a chance to correct your mistakes and become a better person.
I want that.
I want to change.
???
[Narrating] What was I missing, not seeing?
I didn't know the answer and time was running out.
what are you trying to tell me?
Hi, it's Emily Hollander.
I thought I'd stop by and surprise Paige.
has my mother picked her up yet?
[Woman] Ms. Hollander, the gentleman from your office picked Paige up early.
what?
Yes, they left about half an hour ago.
what gentleman? Who authorized that?
you did.
Paige? Mom.
Emily, what's wrong?
someone picked up Paige from school.
I know that. She's here.
mommy, you're home!
Oh, God, sweetie, Paige!
Oh, you're okay.
Oh!
mom, how did she get here?
nice young man from Madacorp dropped her off.
and he said to tell you that Madacorp always has your family in mind.
back to your old tricks, huh?
thought you might get a kick out of it.
So...you're not painting.
I decided I like it the way it is.
me, too.
what are you doing here?
I had a feeling you might not be up to going.
major chick flicks.
you didn't have to.
I wanted to.
just don't tell anyone you saw me with those.
well, uh, I guess I'll leave you to your Kleenex.
actually...
would you mind sticking around for a while?
only if...
I can finally hear your song.
you never give up, do you?
I don't want to, but I'm starting to think we'll never know what he's trying to tell us.
it's certainly not from lack of effort, that's for sure.
what's that?
I keep seeing the numbers 15 and 11 in my head.
those are all things associated with them:
dates, formulas, elements of the Periodic Table.
15 and 11.
do those numbers mean anything to you?
Yeah, Luke 15: 11.
the Prodigal Son.
it's my dad's favorite passage in the bible.
what?
what is it?
it's my letter.
he read it.
you really did it.
this is what he's been trying to tell me.
I HEARD U DAD?
Hey.
Nicole told me. I'm sorry.
Yeah, he died late last night.
you know, I was thinking about the last time I spoke to him, how angry we both were, when I realized somewhere alone the way that I wasn't angry anymore.
I was afraid.
of what?
that he didn't care.
but he did.
Yeah, he did.
I want to thank you.
what you did...
you've made such a difference in my life.
I'm very happy that you're here.
me, too.
okay, what's your problem?
don't have one.
you've been avoiding me all week.
no, I haven't.
seriously, you haven't made one snarky, wise-ass comment to me in days.
I'm coming up with some new material and I'm not ready to launch it.
please, as if you have a self-editing bone in your body.
okay.
I'm going to talk about my feelings, here.
so bear with me if I am a little less articulate than usual.
I'm not really into the whole touchy-feely movement.
that's more like it.
it's just...
every time I look at your eye, the bruises, I get so mad.
all I want to do is find the guy who did this to you and beat the hell out of him.
it's my job as your brother to protect you.
it's one thing if I push you around, but no one else can.
not if I have anything to say about it.
that make any sense?
whoa, not in public.
Oh, and...one other thing.
Hilary Duff called.
she wants her shirt back.
Hey.
Oh, so we're back to that, huh?
for old time's sake.
it's good to see you with a smile on your face.
I've been told it suits me.
Hey, you heading to Miller's class?
Yeah. Just let me put my stuff in my locker.
this is totally not funny.
what is it?
it's my necklace that was stolen.
why did we come to your office?
to get you some help.
Nicole's here?
I don't think she's been a good match for you.
you remember Mr. Ballantine?
Hi.
Hello, Jessi. Nice to see you again.
what's this about?
I'll explain everything to you.
please.
it's okay, Jessi, I'll be right here.
you made the right choice.
don't worry, we'll take good care of her.
it's time for you to concentrate on Stephen Trager.
it's beautiful.
how'd you know I was here?
it's where you used to come with your father.
I heard what happened to Stephen's dad.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't have helped him without you.
Yes, you could.
you wouldn't let me give up.
and I'm glad you didn't.
you did a great thing.
you gave Stephen a chance to say good-bye.
a lot of people never get that.
like you.
when my dad first got sick,
I thought everything would be fine, that he'd get through it.
I just couldn't imagine a world without him in it.
by the time I got the courage to go see him at the hospital, he was so out of it they said he couldn't hear me.
and I believed them.
but after seeing what you did...
I know they were wrong.
he could hear me.
so, did you ever solve how you did it?
not really.
but I thought about what you said, that some things science can't explain.
what I realized was that it doesn't matter how it happened or even why.
what matters is it did.
what's that look?
you're the mind-reader.
you tell me.
on kyle xy...
why are you acting so weird?
Nicole says it's because I like you.
don't you like me? - Yeah, I do.
my dad was notorious for breaking promises.
I don't want to be that kind of father.
you're not; you're a great father.
my sister jessi, she's been having some problems.
we're hoping that you might be able to sit down with her.
it's a really pretty necklace.
Jessi, we're leaving.
you can't tell me what to do!
I want to tell you everything.
I'm ready to hear it.
foss did this?
life is full of regrets.
but no matter how hard you try, you can't change the past.
Lori had been attacked.
no one was sure who did it or why.
and all I could focus on was how I wasn't able to stop it from happening.
Hey.
dad, you have to stop doing this.
and you, do I speak with a british accent?
am I wearing a crown? - No.
then stop guarding my door like I'm queen freakin' elizabeth.
sorry.
he's just worried about you.
I gathered.
sweetie, I know you're just trying to be strong, but what happened, it's a lot to deal with.
what happened is I became one with my inner liberal and got hate-crimed for it.
as far as I'm concerned, this is my badge of honor.
how's she doing today?
apparently, better than I am.
when I look at her it breaks my heart.
Yeah, I feel the same way, but we have to keep it together, and make her feel safe and comfortable.
how about whipping up some sympathy pancakes?
what? She likes them and I'm in the mood.
I'll be right down.
me first.
all yours.
I hope that's the police with news for lori.
I already spoke to them. There are still no leads or eye witnesses.
and since lori can't identify her attacker, then they're at a dead end.
a dr. Keel is on the phone.
Dr. Keel?
she's calling from the hospital about a patient: A william trager.
who is he?
he's my father. Hello.
Yeah, this is his son.
I didn't know stephen's father lived in town.
how long has he been sick?
I don't know. They haven't spoken in years.
it's complicated.
he had a stroke last night.
looks like he's not going to make it.
I'm so sorry, stephen.
is there anything I can do to help?
no, there's nothing to do. I said good-bye to my father years ago.
are things really that bad between them?
I always hoped they'd manage to repair things, but doesn't look like that's going to happen.
Adam baylin said I would touch the world, but what good is having a gift if I couldn't help the people I loved the most?
you didn't have to come.
I know you told everyone not to, but I want to meet your father.
he's in coma, you know? He can't communicate.
I understand.
been a long time since I've seen him.
this wasn't how I envisioned our next meeting.
would you rather go in alone?
Mr. Trager.
yes?
I'm dr. Keel.
Hi, nice to meet you.
so, how's he doing?
well, I'm afraid there's been no improvement.
can he hear us?
this machine monitors his neural patterns.
the readings indicate that he can'T.
I'll give you some time with him.
that's probably for the best that he doesn't know I'm here.
do you really think that?
Yeah. I was a big disappointment to him.
he never agreed with how I chose to live my life.
never listened...
never cared.
are you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.
God, how long were you standing there?
six seconds.
I got mad at my sister.
remind me never to cross you.
so, what's up?
uh, I have a session with your mom today.
Oh, I get it.
you came by for a damage report.
well...
you look awful.
blunt.
does it hurt?
looks worse than it is.
I just hope the cops nail the bastard who did this.
the police?
you know, blue hats, shiny badges?
why would they be involved?
last time I checked the statutes, assault was still a crime.
a crime? - Yeah.
Plus, the creep who did this stole the necklace declan gave me and I want it back.
so, are we done with 20 questions?
I only asked four.
right. Well, you don't want to keep my mom waiting.
what's up, baby?
is that all you got? - Good job, baby.
you okay?
I didn't sleep much last night.
how are you doing?
you mean now that I know the whole truth about you?
I know it was a lot to take in.
but don'T.
how's lori?
she's dealing. You should stop by.
I'm sure she'd appreciate it.
I want to, but what about foss?
we can't be sure it was him.
the cops cleared everyone who was at the rack, which can only mean one thing: Your boy foss is guilty.
I just can't imagine he would go so far.
because he's such a model citizen.
the guy's offed how many people that we know about?
so believing he can knock lori around is not that big a stretch.
I should have seen it coming. I could have done something to prevent it.
Kyle, the guy's a frickin' psycho.
you're not responsible for what he did.
you haven't heard from him, have you?
not since he left last week.
and I have no idea where to find him.
what are you going to do if he comes back?
I have to figure that out.
meanwhile, you should check on lori.
at least for now I think it's safe.
Lori seems fine.
well, appearances can be deceiving.
what do you mean?
sometimes people project what they want others to see, even if it's not an accurate representation of who they are.
we can be different than who we appear to be?
are you writing that down?
not exactly.
sometimes I record what you say.
other times, just my thoughts and impressions.
about me?
well, yes.
can I read them?
Jessi, they're confidential. You know that.
let's talk about emily.
now, when she insisted that you leave the dance, is that the way she normally behaves when she's upset with you?
I guess.
I know everybody thinks she's so nice, but she's not.
she just...appears to be.
what do you mean?
she's always saying that she's in control...
telling me where to go and who to be with.
sometimes, I'm just really scared around her.
ever since my trip to the hospital, I felt like I was in a fog.
but as my head cleared, an image appeared in my mind.
I didn't know what it was or why I was drawing it.
I just knew I had to get it out.
dad?
Hey, guys. What's up?
we figured you weren't feeling that great...
want to go to a movie or something? Our treat.
wait, you'll actually be seen at a movie with me?
at a time like this, I'm willing to risk the embarrassment.
so you're really okay, then?
shouldn't I be asking you that?
dad, your father's in the hospital. My face will heal.
grandpa had a chance to be part of our lives and he chose not to be.
do any of you recognize this?
it's a church, dude.
that's st. Augustine.
how do you know that?
my father belonged to the congregation.
he wanted me and your mom to get married there.
why did you draw this?
I don't know, it just came to me.
I must have seen it recently.
you couldn't have.
this church was torn down years ago.
no st. Augustine in this one, either.
well, he had to have seen it in one of these.
check it out, our first apartment.
Yeah, if you can call a basement sublet with bad plumbing and mice an apartment.
Hey, I loved it.
I did, too.
Oh, you were so beautiful.
I was afraid you were going to wise up at the last minute.
we could have gotten married at the church, you know?
I would have gone along with it.
you remember how he was.
he had to put his stamp on everything.
if I didn't make a stand with our wedding, he would have barked religion at us for the rest of our lives.
instead he just didn't come at all.
I know we both made mistakes.
maybe you should try talking to him.
I know he can't hear you, but saying the words might be enough.
I got nothing to say to him.
not a single picture of the church. How the hell did kyle draw this?
my grandfather sent kyle the image.
but he's in a coma.
like that's going to stop kyle?
just when I'm ready to cross "alien" off my list, you pull another stunt and suck me back in.
I don't do stunts.
you know what I mean. Something unexplainable.
it is explainable.
I'm listening.
okay, I can't explain it. yet, but whatever it is, I'm sure there's a logical scientific explanation.
don't be so sure.
maybe it's divine intervention.
boring.
divine intervention?
maybe god wants you to help stephen make peace with his father.
do you really think that's possible?
with you, anything's possible.
I really wish people would stop sneaking up on me.
sorry.
how you doing? - Fine.
I never knew there were so many shades of purple.
you're painting your room?
time to change it up in here.
Lori, seriously, are you okay?
did you expect to find me in the fetal position?
I-I wouldn't blame you.
look, some coward jumped me.
I'm not going to let him get the best of me.
well, that's great, but I also think you can let yourself freak out a little.
are you going to preston's party this week?
thinking about it. Are you?
I'm sure everyone's expecting me to hide, but I'm going.
you su- - maybe I'll see you there.
I hate hospitals.
they're always so cold.
the colder temperature helps prevent the spread of viruses.
the least they could do is paint the walls, make it feel warmer.
was it difficult to see your father this way?
how did you
Oh, yeah, you're you.
do you think he knows we're here?
the doctor said no.
he can't be sure, right? I mean if you received a message
but did I?
I want to believe I can do this, but
sometimes things happen that just don't make sense.
you've got to have faith that they're happening for a reason.
Hey. What are you two doing in here?
I know it sounds crazy, but when I drew that church.
what if your father's trying to communicate something through me?
and what, you're here waiting for him to communicate again?
I asked kyle to try, mr. Trager.
I thought if your father's reaching out in some way
listen. I know you two both mean well, but my father had plenty of chances to reach out and make amends.
what if he wants one more chance?
there are no more chances. At least not for us.
thanks for taking the time.
I know how hard it must be trying to balance work and raise jessi by yourself.
well, we manage.
still, it must get stressful at times.
Nicole, what are you getting at?
Jessi's expressed some anxiety to me about the way you deal with her.
and I saw the dynamic myself when you showed up at the dance.
the dynamic.
you seem to get very hostile and aggressive.
I asked her not to go, she did anyway.
do you always react that way when she doesn't listen?
you know, I have to say I thought that jessi would be making more progress by now.
I think she is.
she's finally starting to open up to me, and apparently, that makes you uncomfortable.
and that makes me even more concerned.
there's no reason for concern.
but I think I made a mistake bringing jessi to you.
I think it's vital that she continue coming.
in fact, if jessi misses even one appointment, I won't hesitate to call social services.
we can be different than who we appear to be.
are you writing that down?
not exactly.
Jessi lacks empathy.
is socially manipulative, and has no remorse.
Hey.
Hi.
sorry it took me so long.
this guy in line changed his order, like, 60 times.
that's a lot of orders.
Yeah.
what's wrong?
what do you mean?
well, I don't think the coffee is what's bothering you.
it's just. I saw lori earlier.
so?
seeing her all beat up like that.
she's trying to convince herself it's no big deal.
how couldn't it be?
this how'd you feel if you were her.
you get attacked and you don't know why or by who.
I guess I never thought about how it'd make her feel.
Adam told me that as my mind developed, new abilities would reveal themselves to me, like holographic memory.
but this was different.
the church wasn't my memory; it was someone else'S.
if this was a new ability, why couldn't I control it?
and if it wasn't, how could it be happening at all?
it's my father's living room.
this is incredible.
it's exactlyhow I remember it. How did you do this?
I wish I knew.
there's somethingI want you to see.
you grew up here? - Yeah, sure did.
been a long time sinceI've been in this house.
nothing has changed.
every night he'd pour himselfa glass of scotch, sit in this chair, and read his bible.
put it ahead of everything, even his family.
is that why you don'tlike religion?
it's not that I don'tlike religion. It's just.
that I'm a science guy. I need hard evidence, proof.
my father, he neverunderstood that.
strange how somethingmeant to bring people together can split so many apart.
I wrote him a letterafter the kids were born.
hoping he'd want to bepart of our family.
when I came hereto give it to him, we had this huge argument.
he tore it upright in front of me.
never even read it.
was that the last timeyou spoke?
we both said some horrible thingsto each other.
I have always regrettedthe way we left it.
so if he's really tryingto say something, I'm ready to listen.
I need to talk to ballantine, so I'm just going in.
Nicole trager's threatenedto call social services on me.
why would she do that?
it's jessi. She's been willfuland defiant.
she must becomplaining about me during her therapy sessions.
she's a computerwith a glitch. Bring her in. We'll fix her.
with all due respect, I don't think thatthat's a solution.
you may have downloadeda history into her brain, but I've been livingwith that girl.
and she has wantsand desires and feelings like any other teenager.
she's not likeany other teenager.
but you can't just reboot herevery time she acts like one.
ms. Hollander, that's not your concern.
look, I don't thinkI'm the right person for this assignment.
you know, you won't tell mewhat we're really doing here, it's taking a lot longerthan you led me to believe, and I miss my little
I think it'd be bestif I resigned.
you're stressed out.
it's a tough assignment.
and now that you'reso familiar with our agenda, I expect youto see it through.
take a few days to reconsider.
we'd hate to lose you.
brought your biblefor you, dad.
what are you doing.
exactly?
trying to focus on your father.
anything?
not yet.
Hey, I was just heading outfor some coffee.
I thought you mightwant to come along.
Oh, thanks, I'm already pretty deep into the lori trager trifecta.
you have a trifecta?
trashy magazines, nail polish, oprah reruns.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not here to analyze.
you don't have a shrink speechprepared for this scenario?
I don't have a mom speechprepared for this, either.
I never thought I'd have to see you dealwith anything like this.
but I know you'll getthrough it, and I know you need time, and you should know your dad and I are herefor you if you need us.
touching.
what are you doing?
taking my kyle file digital.
going to go videotape the collage he drewon his wall.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing. How do you think he did that?
I gotta go.
do you know what this means?
you're actually doing it.
you're reallycommunicating with him.
but what's a churchand an old room supposed to tell me?
maybe there's moreto the message.
I tried and got nothing.
Stephen's finallyready to listen and I'm letting him down.
when my dad was alive, we used to sit in the gardensat lancaster park and talk for hours.
he always told me I could do anythingif I just believed.
but what if I fail? - You won'T.
how can you be so sure?
because I believe in you.
about the dance, it didn't really endthe way I'd hoped.
I know. With lori and everything.
Yes.
with us, too.
the timing wasn't right.
when will it be?
we'll just know.
what is it?
I don't knowwhat's wrong with me.
nothing's wrong with you;you're just confused.
I lack empathy, I'm socially manipulative, and I have no remorse.
did nicole tell you that?
I just want thingsto make sense.
I want to understandwhy I do the things I do.
you know.
everyone feelsthat way sometimes. Do you?
sure.
do you remember what momused to say about tomorrow?
mom? - Yeah.
she said,"tomorrow'sa clean slate,
a chance to correctyour mistakes and become a better person.
I want that. I want to change.
don't stay up too late.
what was I missing, not seeing?
I didn't know the answer and time was running out.
what are you tryingto tell me?
Hi, it's emily hollander. I thought I'd stop byand surprise paige.
has my motherpicked her up yet?
ms. Hollander, the gentleman from your office picked paige up early.
what?
Yes, they left about half an hour ago.
what gentleman? Who authorized that?
you did.
Paige? Mom.
Emily, what's wrong?
someone picked up paigefrom school.
I know that. She's here.
mommy, you're home!
Oh, god, sweetie, paige! Oh, you're okay.
mom, how did she get here?
nice young man from madacorpdropped her off.
and he said to tell you that madacorp always hasyour family in mind.
bailing. Have fun open the window
back to your old tricks, huh?
thought you mightget a kick out of it.
so. you're not painting.
I decided I like itthe way it is.
me, too.
what are you doing here?
I had a feeling you might not beup to going.
major chick flicks.
you didn't have to. - I wanted to.
just don't tell anyoneyou saw me with those.
well, uh, I guess I'll leave youto your kleenex.
actually.
would you mind stickingaround for a while?
only if.
I can finally hear your song.
you never give up, do you?
I don't want to, but I'm starting to think we'll never knowwhat he's trying to tell us.
it's certainly not from lack of effort, that's for sure.
what's that?
I keep seeing the numbers15 and 11 in my head.
those are all thingsassociated with them:
dates, formulas, elementsof the periodic table.
15 and 11.
do those numbersmean anything to you?
Yeah, luke 15: 11.
the prodigal son.
it's my dad's favorite passagein the bible.
what?
what is it?
it's my letter.
he read it.
you really did it.
this is what he's beentrying to tell me.
I heard you, dad.
Nicole told me. I'm sorry.
Yeah, he diedlate last night.
you know, I was thinking aboutthe last time I spoke to him, how angry we both were, when I realizedsomewhere alone the way that I wasn't angry anymore.
I was afraid.
of what?
that he didn't care.
but he did.
Yeah, he did.
I want to thank you.
what you did.
you've made sucha difference in my life.
I'm very happythat you're here.
me, too.
okay, what's your problem?
don't have one.
no, I haven'T.
seriously, you haven't made one snarky, wise-ass commentto me in days.
I'm coming upwith some new material and I'm not readyto launch it.
please, as if you have a self-editing bonein your body.
okay.
I'm going to talk aboutmy feelings, here.
so bear with me if I am a little lessarticulate than usual.
I'm not really into the wholetouchy-feely movement.
that's more like it.
it's just.
every time I lookat your eye, the bruises,
I get so mad.
all I want to do is findthe guy who did this to you and beat the hell out of him.
it's my job as your brotherto protect you.
it's one thing if I push you around, but no one else can.
not if I have anythingto say about it.
that make any sense?
whoa, not in public.
Oh, and. one other thing.
Hilary duff called.
she wants her shirt back.
Hey.
Oh, so we're backto that, huh?
for old time's sake.
it's good to see youwith a smile on your face.
I've been told it suits me.
Hey, you headingto miller's class? - Yeah.
just let meput my stuff in my locker.
this is totally not funny.
what is it?
it's my necklacethat was stolen.
why did we cometo your office?
to get you some help.
Nicole's here?
I don't think she's beena good match for you.
you remember mr. Ballantine?
Hello, jessi. Nice to see you again.
what's this about?
I'll explaineverything to you. Please.
it's okay, jessi, I'll be right here.
you made the right choice.
don't worry, we'll takegood care of her.
it's time for you to concentrateon stephen trager.
it's beautiful.
how'd you know I was here?
it's where you used to comewith your father.
I heard what happenedto stephen's dad.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't havehelped him without you.
Yes, you could. - You wouldn't let me give up.
and I'm glad you didn'T.
you did a great thing.
you gave stephen a chanceto say good-bye.
a lot of peoplenever get that.
like you.
when my dad first got sick,
I thought everythingwould be fine, that he'd get through it.
I just couldn't imaginea world without him in it.
by the time I got the courageto go see him at the hospital, he was so out of itthey said he couldn't hear me.
and I believed them.
but after seeingwhat you did.
I know they were wrong.
he could hear me.
so, did you ever solvehow you did it?
not really.
but I thought aboutwhat you said, that some thingsscience can't explain.
what I realizedwas that it doesn't matter how it happened or even why.
what matters is it did.
what's that look?
you tell me.
Adam wanted me to give you this.
it's a ring.
that's a beautiful stone.
I'll be back for that.
it's not in there, kid. Your ring?
I sold it. - Who bought it?
welcome to madacorp.
I think I made a mistake bringing jessi to you.
I think it's vital that she continue coming.
in fact, if jessi misses even one appointment,
I won't hesitate to call social services.
cause I like you. Don't you like me?
well, yeah.
let's count to 3 and both say what's on our minds at the same time.
I like you. - I have cancer.
what?
Zzyzx. That's the way in.
when we were down there...I saw things.
this was baylin'S. Can't get it open.
locks can play secrets.
the stronger the lock, the bigger the secret.
Adam baylin's secrets are locked inside this box.
the secrets of zzyzx are locked inside my head.
but what could be so important to make me lock them away and keep them a secret from myself?
I guess sometimes the only thing more elusive than secrets is the key to unlocking them.
in this case, the key was the ring that adam gave me:
the ring I no longer had.
I just don't understand what's so important that's locked inside kyle's head.
everything that zzyzx was able to feed him
that is, before you could fit their remains in an ashtray.
how did your trip with stephen trager go?
it went well.
he opened up about his dead father. I'd say we bonded.
and how are things with nicole since your...altercation?
we'll find out.
she has another session with jessi in a couple of days.
we need to speed things up.
drop the spoon and back away from the stove, nice and easy.
come on, I'm starving.
it's your fault this stuff smells so good.
I think there was a compliment in there somewhere.
pasta, most delicious of all carb delivery systems.
Yeah, it's an old family recipe.
how old?
Oh, about 53 minutes.
Oh, I need you to set an extra place at the table. Amanda is joining us.
did kyle invite her?
Yes, and he's very excited and whatever the kyle version of nervous is.
great. Kyle has a date.
Bye-bye, leftovers.
Josh, this is important to him.
Hey, josh, why don't you invite andy over for dinner?
what, no smart-ass reply?
what's next, locusts?
Hey, guys.
we have a guest for dinner. This is my boss, julian ballantine.
sorry to spring this on you.
I didn't get a chance to call.
Oh, no. Don't be silly.
it's so nice to finally meet you, mr. Ballantine.
Bye-bye, seconds.
this is josh and lori.
good to meet you, and please call me julian.
Nicole.
I brought, uh, red and white.
didn't know what you'd be serving.
Oh, I like red.
I mean-- I mean, I will when I'm 21.
I heard the door. Is amanda
Oh, you must be kyle.
I heard so much about you from stephen.
we work together at madacorp.
excuse me.
you have to forgive kyle.
tonight's kind of a date.
Hi.
you look beautiful.
I didn't know what to wear.
I wasn't sure how fancy it would be or not, - so I- - you wear what you were wearing the first time I saw you, when you were playing the piano.
I had no idea I
wait, how could you even remember that?
how could I forget it?
well, I almost forgot.
there's this concert at seattle phil.
they're playing all pachelbel's works, and- - I'd love to.
go with you, I mean.
you know, I almost brought champagne, but I figured we'd save that till after the test this week.
what test?
it's a systems integration test.
we bring all the software and hardware online together at the same time.
we synch it all up to the mainframe and evaluate the biometric signature compatibility.
so you're turning neural impulses into computer data.
Yeah.
sounds like you understand this stuff better than I do.
you know, maybe I should have served dinner with a manual.
I don't know what I did before we had stephen around, but after this week,
I promise I won't keep him away from you any more than absolutely necessary.
I figured emily can handle the next trip solo.
Oh, emily went with you last weekend?
Yeah. She's part of the project.
I'd like to propose a toast, if I may.
to stephen and your wonderful family, whom I hope I get to know much better in the future.
Cheers. - Cheers.
Baylin's ring? - Yeah.
I saw it right there on ballantine's finger.
what do you think?
the man who just happens to be stephen's boss also just happens to be in possession of a ring
Baylin's ring-- that you pawned.
a ring that just so happens to be the only way of opening baylin's box that you happened to dig up out of that underground death trap.
what do I think? I think there's no such thing as coincidence.
I need to talk to foss about this.
Baylin told you not to trust him.
Baylin told me not to trust taylor.
I think taylor switched the message.
whatever.
you can't just sit back and wait for foss' blessing.
Amanda, it's kyle.
he's gonna be thrilled no matter what you wear.
trust me, if I wear something lame, he'll remember it.
okay, what's the matter?
I got a letter from this conservatory in new york.
I applied there a long time ago to study piano.
and I kind of got in.
that's awesome.
Oh, I would kill to get to go to new york.
I'm totally excited. It's just
it's for a whole semester, and
the long-distance thing.
it explains your attention to detail. - Yeah.
am I crazy to think it could work?
I mean, it's three time zones away.
with any other guy, I'd say don't waste your anytime minutes, but it's kyle.
he spent the last year pining over you from a distance.
I'm sure one semester won't even make a dent.
dig in. Don't worry.
there's, like, zero nutritional value in there.
no, thanks.
I can go back and get a turkey club, if you'd rather have that.
Josh, my stomach's kind of on edge.
I have a test tomorrow.
well, fear not.
I got a laser printer that can print, like, nanoscopic so I can make you the primo cheat sheet.
it's not that kind of test, josh.
you mean- - it's how the doctors are planning more chemo.
right.
you should get some popsicles, then.
no, I was reading online that chemo makes you really dehydrated, and one thing that helps is popsicles.
Josh-- - no, seriously.
what flavors do you like?
you know, just in case the cancer's back.
please don't use the c word.
the other c word.
remember when I said you couldn't talk to anyone about this?
well, that includes me.
homework?
Oh, god, it feels like it.
I've got that systems integration test coming up.
right.
well, ballantine sounded very impressed with you.
so, um...
Hey, you never really told me about your business trip.
you know, san francisco.
well, it was-- it was good.
it was work, but it was good.
and after everything that happened with my dad, it
it was just nice to get away.
Lori, could you get that?
well, I'm glad you got a break.
Yeah. And, uh, well, as it turns out, emily's got a few issues with her father, too.
she really understood.
well, I'm glad you had someone to talk to.
um, phone for you.
Thanks, hon.
hello.
Emily. Hi.
what's up?
Really?
well, that's good news.
but, hey, that's why we get paid the mid-range bucks.
Absolutely. Ah, no problem.
all right, you, too. Bye.
Oh, crap.
you scared me. Who was that?
uh, just someone from work.
um, listen, I'm gonna go take a shower, okay?
I love you, too, sweetie.
thanks for letting me come to work with you today.
just, uh, promise me you won't disassemble the mainframe.
I didn't like misleading stephen, but declan was right.
I couldn't just sit back and do nothing.
I had to face ballantine on his own ground, to try to figure out what we were up against.
you have no idea how delighted I was to hear you were coming to madacorp with stephen.
what brings you here today?
research for a project.
must be very important if they let you out of school.
there's a lot riding on it.
well, I hope I can lend a hand.
I appreciate that.
right this way.
thank you, mr. Ballantine.
I don't know if stephen has told you much about what he's been doing here, but he's working on the cir, short for cerebral impulse relay.
it's a lot like an advanced mri machine.
you know, I must admit I'm not much of a science person.
I'm more of a big picture kind of a guy.
well, what's the big picture of?
well, our hope is to help patients suffering from things like alzheimer's disease, stroke, and dementia recover from memory loss.
give them back that part of their lives before they've really lost it. Please.
ballantine's goal seemed like a noble one, but I couldn't help thinking he was only telling me part of the truth.
since an mri is basically a giant magnet, no one's allowed to bring anything metal into the lab.
your password, sir.
shall we?
security John Smith
Kyle, I'd like to introduce you to the cerebral impulse relay, or cir.
but we like to call it sir.
have a seat.
Oh, not to worry. She's not even online yet.
we're still working out some of the kinks.
but after the system's integration test, she'll be up and running.
maybe some other time.
count on it.
that ring came from baylin.
he made a point of leaving it to you. Why would you pawn it in the first place?
I tried to buy it back.
and this ballantine beat you to it. You know, this
this ring-- this ring is important.
more than you know. It
what do you mean?
look, you just should have told me sooner, that's all.
well, I would have if I'd known where you were.
well, you know what? What's done is done.
so what did you find out about ballantine?
that he must be hiding something, and there's enough security at madacorp to hide whatever it is he's hiding.
well, after taylor, that's one more person you can't trust.
what is-- what are you-- what is he doing here?
he wants to help us. - Him?
like you said, foss, kyle's running out of people he can trust.
help us do what?
get answers.
Ballantine invaded my home, my family, and my privacy.
I don't know what he's doing with my ring and what he wants with me or the tragers.
so what do you want to do?
I want to get my ring back.
I'm glad you came.
well, it's important for jessi.
come on in.
Thanks, nicole.
see you in an hour. - Right.
um, I-- I like your glasses.
Oh, yeah? I lost my contacts.
well, you should lose them more often. You look great.
Thanks. Bye.
come on.
the cameras we have to worry about are here, here, and here.
we can disable those, assuming they're on the same circuit.
then there are motion detectors, double-redundant I. D.Interfaces, and retina scanners.
what's the matter?
I just wonder where he comes in.
worry about yourself, foss. - Wrong.
I have to worry about you because you could get me killed.
we all have to work together on this.
we have one shot, one opportunity.
the system's integration test is the only time we know where ballantine will be, when he'll be there, and that he'll have to take his ring off.
that's our window.
it's tomorrow or nothing.
I don't know. I'm just seeing weird things.
weird how?
I have this memory of being in a fire.
I asked my sister about it, and she said there wasn't any fire.
sometimes it helps to draw the images.
it may help to clarify some things.
want to give it a try?
don't worry how it looks. Just...
draw what you feel.
did someone teach you to draw that way?
no. Am I doing it wrong?
no, no. You-- go on. You're doing fine.
and you're sure this will fool madacorp's retina scan?
as long as kyle can upload it into the security system.
the image is clean.
Amanda, you got my message.
Yeah. I got the tickets.
totally scored the orchestra seats.
are you all right? - Yes.
I'm sorry, but something came up.
what?
something important.
it happens.
I promise I'll make it up to you.
don't worry about it.
it's no big deal.
I'd better go.
mom, you got a minute? - Sure.
I need to talk to you, strictly confidential.
okay.
so you're not my mom, you're my therapist.
Andy has cancer.
Oh, no.
Oh, josh, I'm so sorry.
I finally meet a girl that I like
I mean, she's awesome. She likes to play g-force.
she loves zombie movies-- the unrated ones you think I don't watch.
and I want to help her through this, but she won't let me talk to her about it.
what would you say to her if you could?
I don't know.
something to make her feel better.
you may not have to say anything to do that.
Andy might just need you to hang in there with her, and if the time comes when she wants to talk, you'll be ready.
Paige AT SALLY'S PARTY 3: 30 BEACHWOOD COMMUNITY CENTER
hello.
it's kyle.
Hi. Is everything okay?
well, when I was in your office, I think I left my binder.
okay, well, I can bring it home with me.
I can pick it up.
it's kind of important, and I'm not that far away.
well, I'm heading to the systems integration test, but I can have security let you in.
Thanks.
no turning back now.
are you sure you want to do this?
Yeah.
are you?
Absolutely.
hello.
stephen trager, please.
he's not in. Can I take a message?
I'm calling from the stratford hotel.
Mr. Trager stayed here last weekend, and it seems he left his contact lenses in his room.
uh, my dad doesn't wear contacts.
are you certain?
he was the last guest to stay in that room. - Who is that?
wrong number.
okay.
here's hoping the test goes as well as it did in simulations.
well, you'll be fired if it doesn'T.
kidding.
but hollander's out on her ass.
Mr. Ballantine's office.
Hi, I've got a package down here for a mr. Ballantine that I need a signature for.
I'll be right down.
Thanks.
how do we bypass the security system?
once I get inside ballantine's office...
your password, sir.
I'll be able to access the madacorp mainframe.
that'll give me complete control of all the building's video cameras, doors, and retina scanners.
I'll be able to switch the image of foss' retina with ballantine'S.
and you know where you'll be.
Madacorp IS PEOPLE
let me go, man!
get off me!
I'm gonna take this punk upstairs.
get off me, man! I didn't do anything!
the truth is out there!
resistance is futile!
you have a package here for mr. Ballantine?
thank you, mr. Ballantine.
damn it, did you have to practically break my arm?
I had to look convincing.
why not just taser me?
I considered it.
don't mess this up.
that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
you copy, smith?
go for smith.
we got a report of a disturbance in the north b stairwell.
copy that.
you ARE TRAPPED
the guard will be detained...
and so will the assistant.
foss, you're good to go.
my code name at zzyzx.
what did ballantine have to do with zzyzx?
I need to see my dad right now.
miss, is he expecting you?
no, he's not expecting me.
it's a family emergency.
he's in the middle of a software test.
fine. I'll wait.
I had no idea what I'd find on ballantine's computer, but once I was there in front of it,
I had to take advantage of the opportunity.
I thought the experiments at zzyzx had ended with me.
well, looks like you two have your jobs for another day.
was that a congratulations? - I think so.
Lori, what's wrong?
I need to talk to you in private.
well, let's go to my office.
excuse me. - Of course.
looks like someone's upset over some contact lenses.
we got a problem.
did you get the ring? - No.
Ballantine has it.
he's headed your way.
get out now.
Mr. Ballantine, there appears to have been a security breach.
are you paige? - Mm-hmm.
Where's your mommy?
away.
what's wrong?
I wanted a lion.
can I have a crayon?
who are you?
just a friend.
what's going on?
honey, whatever it is, you can tell me.
are you having an affair with emily?
why would you think that?
the hotel called, the one you stayed at on your business trip.
they said you left your contact lenses in the room.
I don't wear contacts.
I know.
but emily does.
Oh, honey, the hotel made a mistake.
I'm just afraid you did.
Lori, nothing happened.
I've seen how you act when she calls.
you get all happy and excited.
we work together. She understands what I do.
does she understand that you're married?
Oh! - Oh!
I'm sorry. - That's okay.
no problem.
that guard is kyle's handler.
did you get the ring? - No.
we got to get out of here.
wait. Where's foss?
he's coming.
there he is.
ballantine's headed this way.
wait. - What?
is he close? - Yes.
we got to go.
can you stop the doors from automatically retracting?
I can.
what?
MacGyver reruns.
the problem seemed complex, but the math was a simple mix of algebra and geometry.
the angle of the incidence equals the angle of reflection on the madacorp logo.
Kyle!
come on, man.
that gave me ballantine's distance.
distance divided by the time told me that he'd reach the elevator in...
three, two, one.
do it now.
lock down the building now.
the building is now on lockdown.
there's an emergency exit out in the lobby.
are you okay?
uh, I'm fine.
you're not fine.
come on. Get up.
come on.
we got company.
just leave me. - No.
they're coming.
get him out of here.
what are you gonna do? - Buy you some time.
we're not leaving you.
listen to me.
the ring is all you need. - What?
now go.
thank you.
get out of here!
we need backup, level 3!
stupid ankle.
I have to go back. - You can'T.
they'll take the ring, and all this will have been for nothing.
but foss-- - he wanted you to get that ring back.
I hope it's worth it.
sir, we got this one, but the others got away.
take him to room 237.
move it.
a kiss for mommy?
I missed you.
Oh, I missed you more.
is this me?
no. That's my new friend.
your new friend?
Yeah. She made me these.
okay, sweetie, let's go.
I was just returning a cd of lori'S.
did you have fun, doing whatever you had to do?
I wish I could have gone to the concert with you.
it's okay.
I understand.
actually, I don't understand.
one minute you're thrilled to spend time with me and all excited to go to the concert, and then you cancel without telling me why.
you say it's important, but you won't tell me why it's important.
I know what's going on.
you do?
I rushed you into this.
admit it. Now you're having doubts.
I do have doubts, but
if that's the way you feel, there's something I really need to tell you
no.
Amanda, I have doubts about everything in my life...
except how I feel about you.
I just
what did you need to tell me?
not important.
wow, How bad do you suck?
well, you do.
gonna give me a chance?
at the game?
aren't you working?
you're just afraid that I'll smoke you.
right.
dream much?
I got the test results.
And?
let's just say I'm gonna need a lot of popsicles.
cherry okay?
my favorite.
want half?
cool.
my turn? - Hit it.
I'm gonna try the-- oops.
Mr. Ballantine?
your appointment is here.
send him in.
it's nice to finally meet you, mr. Taylor.
pleasure.
we had a little security breach.
someone stole my ring, but it's being taken care of.
it had better be.
no need for alarm. It was just A...
heirloom from my late father.
an heirloom.
that heirloom is a latnock ring.
you people and your rings.
forgive me if I don't lose any sleep over a glorified pledge pin.
you really don't have any idea how important that ring is.
do you?
Adam baylin's secret had been locked inside this box for 15 years, almost as long as I'd been alive.
would his secrets provide the answers to my own?
or simply raise more questions?
there was only one way to know for sure.
I'm Adam Baylin.
so you created me.
he's been shot.
I got accepted into a music program in New York.
I leave in two days. -Two days?
what if your father's trying to communicate something through me?
you're really communicating with him.
the entire Zzyzx databank.
all of our research, everything we've ever done or recorded, it's been copied.
copied? Where?
you were the one I could always open up to.
I miss this. I miss you.
I miss you, too.
Lori, what's wrong?
are you having an affair with Emily?
take him to Room 237.
big Tom Foss.
you let them break you, Tom.
Jessi needs your help. She's in danger, isn't she?
you're the only one who can bring her home safely.
[Declan] The thing I admire most about you is your faith in people.
but I worry this time it's gonna be the end of you.
why Jessi? How are you two connected?
she and I are the same.
what is that supposed to mean?
I don't even know who you are.
I've been keeping secrets, too
but I discovered something huge about
you don't have to do what they want.
you can make your own choices.
now let me help you.
you'll take me back.
we're not going back, not until this is all over.
[Kyle narrating] I'd risked everything to find her:
my home, my family, their trust.
no one understood why I believed in her.
even she didn't feel worthy of my belief.
but I felt somewhere there must be good in her.
I wasn't sure where we should go, but I knew we couldn't return home until we were ready to face the danger that awaited us.
and I had faith that together we'd find our way.
no appetite for Madacorp cuisine?
I never expected things to go this far.
I was supposed to facilitate the retrieval of data from one superbrain to the next.
but all I've done is manipulate a confused girl and mess with an innocent family.
now Kyle's run off after Jessi.
ballantine's ordered me to dispose of you.
I thought that I was working for the good guys.
but the collateral damage doesn't seem warranted.
foss, where are you?
never mind. Just keep moving.
where? I'm with Jessi, and I don't know...
shut up and listen. You already know where to go.
it's someplace safe.
you have all you need.
what are you talking about?
you heard me.
I'll catch up to you.
no. I want you to stay and look after my family.
foss, will you do it?
Yeah. Now just get rid of your phone.
what?
Kyle, your phone.
I said kill it.
you were right to tell me that Jessi was gone.
but now we've lost both of them.
I thought Foss would lead us straight to them.
you underestimated him.
and I'm getting tired of waiting.
I'll find another way.
you'd better, and quickly.
now get the hell out of my office.
we can't call the police, not yet.
well, we can't just sit here.
our former security guard is locked up at Madacorp by Kyle's parents' lawyer.
obviously, something is very wrong.
that's an understatement.
look, I know you're upset, but let's try to make sense of things first.
let Kyle find Jessi.
what does that have to do with it?
everything is connected somehow.
hopefully, Kyle can explain.
but will he?
he's been hiding things, and you've been helping him.
you knew he rescued a girl from a fire without getting as much as a blister.
and it took you how many months to mention it to me?
he was afraid they would take him away.
I promised I wouldn't tell anyone.
well, I'm not anyone.
I'm your husband.
there's trouble in paradise.
go away.
I'm serious.
I heard Mom and Dad fighting about something, and I haven't done anything lately, so what's it about?
I don't know. They didn't send me a memo.
we need Kyle to tune in and do a little recon for us, but I can't find him anywhere.
well, he has to be here. Mom has us on lockdown.
unless he's added invisibility to his bag of tricks, he's not home.
maybe he went to Amanda's.
uh, maybe you know where he went.
he went after her, didn't he?
went after who?
she who shall not be named.
how could he do that?
how can you cover for him?
what happened to your cooler head?
she's a horrible, toxic person who attacked me.
he's not excusing her for what she did.
he just wants to bring her home.
Why?
why does he have to be all nice and sympathetic, going all Kyle on her when she doesn't deserve it?
you know Kyle. He sees something in her, and his instincts about people are always right.
we should give him the benefit of the doubt.
Declan loaned you his car?
I told him I had to find you.
he must be angry, now that he knows what I did to Lori.
why did you do that?
how could you hurt her that way?
I don't know.
I couldn't control myself.
what is that supposed to mean?
you couldn't stop yourself from hitting her?
sometimes...
a darkness comes over me.
it scares me.
I'm really sorry it happened, and I know Lori will never forgive me.
she may not.
you have to earn forgiveness.
you can't run from your mistakes.
you said we weren't going back.
now until we get some answers.
where?
foss said I have all I need.
what does that mean?
the ring is all you need.
what? Now go.
a ring?
it was a gift from Adam Baylin, my friend.
he created the experiment.
he doesn't sound like a friend.
he never meant to harm anyone.
they forced him out of Zzyzx and then killed him.
I don't remember taking this.
that's not us.
that's Adam.
he looks just like you.
she looks like...- I know.
and if he created me.
I have to find her.
I have to know who this woman is.
the light will show you the way.
you know Hungarian?
I guess so.
the light will show you the way.
it's just a ring.
nothing is just anything if it comes from Adam.
there's a hole.
where? In- In the stone?
no. In the band behind the stone.
I think this goes way beyond anything we could have imagined.
when I first lost my job, all I knew was LWK Software was bought up by another company.
what does that have to do with anything?
well, I've been doing some digging around, and the company that bought LWK is a subsidiary of Madacorp.
that must be-- Another coincidence?
start a list.
Kyle's father?
here's one about his mom.
I found 15 different articles on Kyle's parents over the past several years, all of them glowing tributes.
so what's the problem?
every one of them was distributed on the web on the same day, like they were deliberately planted.
Why?
I don't know, but those two showed up out of nowhere.
those two were his parents.
there was a blood test. They matched.
and Kyle remembered them.
Kyle remembered who?
guys, this is private.
did you know Kyle left and went after Jessi?
how could you let him do that?
it's complicated. -Try me.
Lori, not now. You're just going to have to trust us.
okay, big mouth's gone. What's the deal?
out.
how is this going to work?
like a pinhole camera to view an eclipse.
we position the ring here.
and let the light pass through.
hit the switch.
okay.
here.
this map isn't very detailed.
I can't tell if we've passed Route 12 yet.
there's no signs for it.
she must be my mother.
I look so much like her. Who else could she be?
I wish Adam was alive.
he would know.
do you think she's still alive?
I mean, if she is, then I'd have somebody.
there'd be someone like me.
I'm like you.
what's wrong?
well, well, well.
the young lovebirds return.
still sneaking around? Huh?
still the happy couple?
you- You know us?
well, of course I know you.
you used to hole up in that booth over there for hours.
I'm sorry. We're just a little confused.
it's not you. My grandfather gets mixed up sometimes.
I don't get mixed up.
he's grilled cheese, chocolate shake.
she's Cobb salad, cheery cola.
grandpa, these people just remind you of someone.
he can't tell you what day it is, but he remembers his customers' orders from years ago.
what?
the two of you used to play that song all the time.
why don't you folks have a seat?
come on. I'll cut you some pie.
I don't want any pie. Come on.
what is it?
third row, fourth one down.
do you have a quarter?
[Kyle] It's not there.
[Declan] Where are you?
in a diner somewhere with Jessi.
you found her?
Yes. Are the Tragers okay?
not exactly. Lori's pissed that you went after Jessi, and apparently your parents are fighting.
about what?
my best guess would be you.
has Foss been around?
I asked him to watch over the family.
then knowing him, he's probably listening right now.
listen, you'd better get back here.
[Kyle] I can't yet.
they're going to want some answers when you get home,
I got to go.
was that Kyle?
he's with her right now, isn't he?
look, I'm feeling kind of caught in the middle here.
then free yourself and tell me what's going on.
I should go.
okay.
chocolate shake, cherry cola.
what did I tell you?
it sounded good.
so what are you folks doing around here?
looking for Route 12.
route 12.
a flood washed that out years ago.
what would you want to do up there?
just exploring.
well, there's not much to explore.
it's pretty isolated.
I'd be careful.
what if there is nothing there?
there has to be. Otherwise, Foss wouldn't send us.
you're worried.
when I get home, I have to tell my family everything.
we don't have to go back.
we can find Route 12, see what's there, and keep going.
I want to go back.
Why?
they're everything to me.
you have people you care about who care about you.
Yes.
I do.
you realize we're doing this without a warrant.
everything incriminating will not be held against him.
at least for now.
socks in the desk?
and porn under the mattress.
Ah. Got it.
one prays for moments like this.
who'd like to go first?
give us a free pass on this one.
Oh, I think not.
what do you want with my Kyle file?
we just need to borrow it for a while.
Why?
enough with the looks. Why are you skulking around?
Yeah. Skulking's my job.
don't mess with the balance of nature.
seriously, if there's something going on with Kyle,
I want to know.
well, the truth is the situation does concern all of us.
there's a...situation?
all right, we'll tell you what we know.
no more secrets?
no more secrets.
what's in the box?
what?
I saw you with her, and then I opened the box.
you were inside my mind.
you got into mine.
I guess it works for both of us.
but how did you do it? We weren't even touching.
you seemed lost in thought.
I just...
concentrated.
they want me to get what you have locked in your brain.
that's what Emily told me.
she said once they have it, I can be free.
Jessi, that information, it could be dangerous.
we can't give it to them.
if I got into your head, what makes you think I won't take it?
because I choose to trust you.
I've done terrible things.
leave me here.
what?
I don't belong with someone like you.
you should go on without me. Jessi. - [Grandpa] You scratched that in.
grandpa, it's okay.
you never came back after that.
not till today.
I'm sorry.
what was that about?
I don't know.
but it's part of our history.
we have to find out.
whatever happens, we're in this together.
this is like a Kyle convention.
Kyle 101.
a symposium on all things Kyle.
Kyle-a-con.
be serious.
Oh, I've been serious, and all of you mocked me.
but now you want to study my evidence.
just give us the file.
every time something unusual happened concerning Kyle, we managed to explain it or overlook it.
but there are too many incidents.
they have to add up. - To what?
well, that's what we're here to figure out.
what do you want?
Kyle told me you'd be around.
I think the family's starting to put things together.
Yeah, I heard.
what if they find out the truth?
well, they would, eventually.
it won't matter anyway.
they'd never turn their backs on Kyle.
we haven't.
unless they found out that he's been lying to them.
they'll never forgive him.
what is he supposed to do?
well, it was a nice setup while it lasted, but once he gets back, he'll have to move on.
whatever.
this can't lead anywhere, not anymore.
we're here. We might as well check it out.
how far are we supposed to go?
as far as we can.
you really believe, don't you?
I don't know if we'll find anything, but we might.
I mean, there's a chance.
there's hope.
I make things happen.
strange things, when I'm angry or upset.
like what?
I made lights explode.
I shattered a skylight.
you did?
not intentionally.
how do we do that?
it has to do with harnessing energy and projecting it to the outside world.
and they made us this way, the people who created us?
being in the pod gave our brains more time to develop.
are we the only ones?
as far as I know.
I thought I was the only one until you came along.
competition.
I don't think of it that way.
maybe you should.
maybe I'm smarter...
stronger...
faster.
the results of his MRI when I first took him on as a patient showed an unprecedented amount of brain activity, but the second MRI, months later, was normal.
he sleeps in a tub.
let's start with that.
and I think we can scratch "normal off our Kyle adjective list.
I'm less concerned about his idiosyncrasies than I am about some of the more disturbing things he's been involved with.
he was found wandering near Kearn's skeleton.
professor Kearn taught at U-Dub, where he mentored a student named Adam Baylin.
who looked just like Kyle.
and kidnapped him, raising him for five years until he committed suicide.
and he comes to us with no memory of any of this until his parents suddenly show up, and he leaves with them.
they're dead.
dad, you're creeping me out.
remember that basketball game where he scored all those awesome half-court jumpers?
okay, a bunch of people died.
but it's not like Kyle's responsible.
but they're all connected to him.
he didn't sleep for over a week.
he jumped off our roof.
he predicted lightning, an earthquake.
there are pages of this.
and don't forget, he drew a picture of my father's living room perfectly, even though he'd never been there.
no one should be able to do any of these things, and yet Kyle has done all of them.
because he's incredible.
he's amazing.
and you're acting like he's done something wrong, like he's some sort of freak.
we're just trying to make sense of what's happened.
don't put him on trial before he gets home.
give him a chance to explain.
that's what you do for me and Lori when you think we screwed up.
seriously, Josh, when you hear all this stuff together, it sounds so wild and weird.
when you think about it, what do we really know about Kyle?
I know. Who is he?
what are you talking about?
he's our brother.
he's your son.
and now, I'n not doing this anymore.
who'd live all the way out here?
I think it may be somebody who's expecting us.
you can't just walk into someone's house.
I can.
[Kyle] Hello?
is anyone here?
are we in the right place?
I think so.
I know this book.
it's in Hungarian.
dad.
Yeah.
I know you didn't do anything.
I know you love Mom.
I should have never doubted you.
I'm so sorry.
sweetie.
thank you for apologizing.
I don't know how much longer we should wait to go after him.
we don't know where he is.
why don't you try his cell? I just did.
he's still not picking up.
I know he was talking to Declan earlier, but he wouldn't tell me anything.
you think Declan has something to tell?
he was Mood Swing Central when Kyle left with the Petersons, and he only got worse when Kyle came back.
this spot in the woods.
Declan went there with Kyle, and they followed these coordinates.
the numbers Kyle kept repeating under hypnosis.
that place in the woods.
it could be the same.
same as what?
we didn't tell you guys, but we went to the woods about a month ago near Victor Falls, and there were these freaky underground tunnels we got stuck in.
tunnels?
like a bomb shelter.
Kyle said there was nothing there but trees.
Oh, believe me, there's something there, and Kyle really did not want us to go.
Kyle and Declan.
doesn't seem like anyone stayed here in a while.
is that a closet?
we didn't check.
I think we just found what we came for.
how do we get in?
there are a million possible combinations.
it's like a song.
the song.
the song in the juke box?
and from the back of the picture.
that has to be it.
well, even if it is, we don't know how to play it.
I know someone who will.
where are you?
it's hard to explain.
I need your help.
sure. What's up?
do you know a song called She Could Be You?
no. Never heard of it.
do you think you could look it up and play the melody?
Kyle, what's this about?
I'm trying to figure something out.
that song could be the key.
tell her it's important.
are you with Jessi?
Yes.
you're calling me for help, and you're out somewhere with her?
Amanda, I...
that's completely inappropriate.
I wish I could tell you why.
give it a shot.
all I can say is I'll never do anything to betray you.
you know I wouldn't ask you for this if it wasn't something I really needed.
you know how much I care about you.
give me a few minutes.
got your message.
what's going on?
we need you to tell us about that place in the woods.
what place?
I've already told them about that night.
we're not fooling around here.
Mr. Trager, I wish I could help, but I don't know anything about it.
we're concerned about Kyle, Declan, and you seem to be involved in a lot of things we're trying to understand about him.
like I said, I wish I could help.
that's it.
what are you doing?
something I should have done already.
I'm calling the cops.
wait. Don't do that.
why shouldn't he?
don't call the police.
not if you care what happens to Kyle.
get the hell out of my house.
Mr. Trager, its okay.
he's looked out for Kyle from the beginning.
he's a friend.
you know what's going on.
you lied. You've been lying.
I've been trying to protect Kyle.
from what?
I don't want to hear your crap anymore. Get out.
get out!
please, listen to him.
okay. I found the music online.
you ready?
I'm listening.
is that what you needed?
that's perfect.
thank you, Amanda.
you're welcome.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
will you be back in time to say good-bye?
I want to be.
she played it?
Yes.
you were right.
wait.
no matter what we find in there, you've done a lot for me, and I want to thank you.
you don't need to.
you've made me feel safe, and you've given me hope.
who is he? - Adam Baylin
I thought you said Adam Baylin was dead.
I scattered his ashes.
I guess they weren't his.
why would they make me believe that?
[Foss] I'm sure that you have questions, but Kyle should answer them.
no. You tell me now.
last time I saw you,
Brian Taylor had you locked up in a room at Madacorp.
Why?
we had a disagreement. - What kind of answer is that?
all I can tell you is Kyle's done nothing wrong.
you were our security guard, but Declan said you looked out for Kyle from the beginning.
what did he mean?
that means...
I've known him since he was a child.
he's been through a lot.
and he's very special, but you already know that.
do you know where he is? I think so.
he's asked me to stay around to look after your family.
all he's ever wanted was to be a part of your family.
to Kyle, this is home.
well, I can take care of my family.
it's time for you to go.
and bring our son home.
he knows I'm here.
I think we can communicate with him.
I've done it before.
we can pick up the electrical impulses in his brain, just like the monitor.
no.
I don't want to.
okay.
I'll try.
I really don't want to talk.
then just listen.
I know it's been a strange day.
it's been a strange year.
and remembering all the things that have happened since Kyle's been with us, and knowing he's connected to Jessi in some way and the...trouble that's caused us...
I just want to tell all of you that I'm sorry.
you're sorry? What for?
I'm the one that brought them both into this house.
that's not your fault.
I was just so taken with Kyle, and I- I accepted things that didn't make sense, and I allowed wanting to protect him to come between us.
I am so sorry, Steven.
Hey.
it's okay.
we can get through anything, remember?
Yeah.
this isn't one of those group hug moments, is it?
Josh, you were right before. - I was?
when we said we didn't know who Kyle really is.
we know who he is. He's part of our family.
when he comes back, he'll explain.
so does that mean you're not going to call the cops?
hopefully, I won't have a reason to.
so what do we do now?
we wait for Kyle to come home.
is he communicating with you?
I think he's trying, but I'm not getting anything.
will you help me?
I don't know how.
don't be afraid.
open your mind.
and focus.
[Narrating] I needed to know why our journey had led us here.
hoping Adam would guide us forward,
I cleared my mind and opened my heart, trying to connect with him, strengthening the pathway with Jessi's help.
while focused on Adam,
I felt all the barriers between us slip away, then a powerful exchange of energy as Jessi reached into my mind and connected with me.
[Adam] Kyle, stop. She's betrayed you.
no. Jessi.
Jessi, wait!
no. No.
why are you running?
I did it. I got into your head.
when you tried to connect with Baylin, I took what they wanted me to.
the information.
why did you take it?
I couldn't help myself.
you shouldn't have trusted me.
No!
I'm Adam Baylin.
so you created me.
he's been shot.
I got accepted into a music program in New York.
I leave in two days.
two days?
what if your father's trying to communicate something through me?
you're really communicating with him.
the entire Zzyzx databank.
all of our research, everything we've ever done or recorded, it's been copied.
copied? Where?
you were the one I could always open up to.
I miss this. I miss you.
I miss you, too.
Lori, what's wrong?
are you having an affair with Emily?
take him to Room 237.
big Tom Foss.
you let them break you, Tom.
Jessi needs your help. She's in danger, isn't she?
you're the only one who can bring her home safely.
the thing I admire most about you is your faith in people.
but I worry this time it's gonna be the end of you.
why Jessi? How are you two connected?
she and I are the same.
what is that supposed to mean?
I don't even know who you are.
I've been keeping secrets, too
I've beenkeeping secrets, too- - but I discovered something huge about
you don't have to do what they want.
you can makeyour own choices. Now let me help you.
you'll take me back.
we're not going back, not until this is all over.
I'd risked everything to find her: My home, my family, their trust.
no one understood why I believed in her.
even she didn't feel worthy of my belief.
but I felt somewhere there must be good in her.
I wasn't sure where we should go, but I knew we couldn't return home until we were ready to face the danger that awaited us.
and I had faith that together we'd find our way.
no appetite for Madacorp cuisine?
I never expected things to go this far.
I was supposed to facilitate the retrieval of data from one superbrain to the next.
but all I've done is manipulate a confused girl and mess with an innocent family.
now Kyle's run off after Jessi.
ballantine's ordered me to dispose of you.
I thought that I was working for the good guys.
but the collateral damage doesn't seem warranted.
foss, where are you?
never mind. Just keep moving.
where? I'm with Jessi, and I don't know...
shut up and listen.
you already know where to go.
it's someplace safe.
you have all you need.
what are you talking about?
you heard me.
I'll catch up to you.
no. I want you to stay and look after my family.
foss, will you do it?
Yeah. Now just get rid of your phone.
what?
Kyle, your phone.
I said kill it.
you were right to tell me that Jessi was gone.
but now we've lost both of them.
I thought Foss would lead us straight to them.
you underestimated him.
and I'm getting tired of waiting.
I'll find another way.
you'd better, and quickly.
we can't call the police, not yet.
well, we can't just sit here.
our former security guard is locked up at Madacorp by Kyle's parents' lawyer.
obviously, something is very wrong.
that's an understatement.
look, I know you're upset, but let's try to make sense of things first.
let Kyle find Jessi.
what does that have to do with it?
everything is connected somehow.
hopefully, Kyle can explain.
but will he?
he's been hiding things, and you've been helping him.
you knew he rescued a girl from a fire without getting as much as a blister.
and it took you how many months to mention it to me?
he was afraid they would take him away.
I promised I wouldn't tell anyone.
well, I'm not anyone.
I'm your husband.
there's trouble in paradise.
go away.
I'm serious. I heard mom and dad fighting about something, and I haven't done anything lately, so what's it about?
I don't know. They didn't send me a memo.
we need Kyle to tune in and do a little recon for us, but I can't find him anywhere.
well, he has to be here. Mom has us on lockdown.
unless he's added invisibility to his bag of tricks, he's not home.
maybe he went to Amanda's.
uh, maybe you know where he went.
he went after her, didn't he?
went after who?
she who shall not be named.
how could he do that? How can you cover for him?
what happened to your cooler head?
she's a horrible, toxic person who attacked me.
he's not excusing her for what she did.
he just wants to bring her home.
Why?
why does he have to be all nice and sympathetic, going all Kyle on her when she doesn't deserve it?
you know kyle.
he sees something in her, and his instincts about people are always right.
we should give him the benefit of the doubt.
Declan loaned you his car?
I told him I had to find you.
he must be angry, now that he knows what I did to Lori.
why did you do that?
how could you hurt her that way?
I don't know.
I couldn't control myself.
what is that supposed to mean?
you couldn't stop yourself from hitting her?
sometimes...
a darkness comes over me.
it scares me.
I'm really sorry it happened, and I know Lori will never forgive me.
she may not.
you have to earn forgiveness.
you can't run from your mistakes.
you said we weren't going back.
now until we get some answers.
where?
foss said I have all I need.
what does that mean?
the ring is all you need.
what?
now go.
a ring?
it was a gift from Adam Baylin, my friend.
he created the experiment.
he doesn't sound like a friend.
he never meant to harm anyone.
they forced him out of Zzyzx and then killed him.
I don't remember taking this.
that's not us.
that's Adam.
he looks just like you.
she looks like...- I know.
and if he created me.
I have to knowwho this woman is.
the light will show you the way.
you know Hungarian?
I guess so.
the light will show you the way.
it's just a ring.
nothing is just anything if it comes from Adam.
there's a hole.
where? In- In the stone?
no.
in the bandbehind the stone.
I think this goes way beyond anything we could have imagined.
when I first lost my job, all I knew was LWK Software was bought up by another company.
what does that have to do with anything?
well, I've been doing some digging around, and the company that bought LWK is a subsidiary of Madacorp.
that must be-- Another coincidence?
start a list.
Kyle's father?
here's one about his mom.
I found 15 different articles on Kyle's parents over the past several years, all of them glowing tributes.
so what's the problem?
every one of them was distributed on the web on the same day, like they were deliberately planted.
Why?
I don't know, but those two showed up out of nowhere.
those two were his parents.
and kyle remembered them.
Kyle remembered who?
guys, this is private.
did you know Kyle left and went after Jessi?
how could you let him do that?
it's complicated.
try me.
Lori, not now. You're just going to have to trust us.
okay, big mouth's gone. What's the deal?
out.
how is this going to work?
like a pinhole camera to view an eclipse.
we position the ring here.
and let the light pass through.
hit the switch.
here.
this map isn't very detailed.
I can't tell if we'vepassed route 12 yet. There's no signs for it.
she must be my mother.
I look so much like her. Who else could she be?
I wish Adam was alive.
he would know.
do you think she's still alive?
I mean, if she is, then I'd have somebody.
there'd be someone like me.
I'm like you.
what's wrong?
well, well, well.
the young lovebirds return.
still sneaking around? Huh?
still the happy couple?
you- You know us?
well, of course I know you.
you used to hole up in that booth over there for hours.
I'm sorry. We're just a little confused.
it's not you.
my grandfathergets mixed up sometimes.
I don't get mixed up.
he's grilled cheese, chocolate shake. She's cobb salad, cheery cola.
grandpa, these people just remind you of someone.
he can't tell you what day it is, but he remembers his customers' orders from years ago.
what?
the two of you used to play that song all the time.
why don't you folks have a seat?
come on. I'll cut you some pie.
I don't want any pie.
come on.
what is it?
third row, fourth one down.
do you have a quarter?
it's not there.
where are you?
in a diner somewhere with jessi.
you found her?
Yes. Are the tragers okay?
not exactly.
Lori's pissedthat you went after jessi, and apparentlyyour parents are fighting.
about what?
my best guess would be you.
has foss been around?
I asked himto watch over the family.
then knowing him, he's probably listeningright now.
listen, you'd better get back here.
I can't yet.
they're going to want someanswers when you get home, I got to go.
was that kyle?
he's with her right now, isn't he?
look, I'm feeling kind ofcaught in the middle here.
then free yourselfand tell me what's going on.
I should go.
okay. Chocolate shake, cherry cola.
what did I tell you?
it sounded good.
so what are you folksdoing around here?
looking for route 12.
route 12.
a flood washed that out years ago.
what would you want to do up there?
just exploring.
well, there's not much to explore.
I'd be careful.
what if there is nothing there?
there has to be. Otherwise, Foss wouldn't send us.
you're worried.
when I get home, I have to tell my family everything.
we don't have to go back.
we can find Route 12, see what's there, and keep going.
I want to go back.
Why?
they're everything to me.
you have people you care about who care about you.
Yes.
I do.
you realize we're doing this without a warrant.
everything incriminating will not be held against him.
at least for now.
socks in the desk?
and porn under the mattress.
Ah. Got it.
one prays for moments like this.
who'd like to go first?
give us a free pass on this one.
Oh, I think not. What do you wantwith my kyle file?
we just need to borrow itfor a while.
Why?
enough with the looks. Why are you skulking around?
Yeah. Skulking's my job.
don't mess with the balance of nature.
seriously, if there'ssomething going on with kyle, I want to know.
well, the truth is the situation does concernall of us.
there's A...situation?
all right, we'll tell you what we know.
no more secrets?
no more secrets.
what's in the box?
what?
I saw you with her, and then I opened the box.
you were inside my mind.
you got into mine.
I guess it works for both of us.
but how did you do it? We weren't even touching.
you seemed lost in thought. I just...
concentrated.
they want me to get what you have locked in your brain.
that's what emily told me. She said once they have it, I can be free.
Jessi, that information, it could be dangerous. We can't give it to them.
if I got into your head, what makes you thinkI won't take it?
because I choose to trust you.
I've done terrible things.
leave me here.
what?
I don't belongwith someone like you.
you should go on without me.
you scratched that in.
grandpa, it's okay.
you never came back after that.
not till today.
I'm sorry.
what was that about?
I don't know.
but it's part of our history.
we have to find out.
whatever happens, we're in this together.
this is likea kyle convention.
Kyle 101.
a symposiumon all things kyle.
be serious.
Oh, I've been serious, and all of you mocked me.
but now you want to study my evidence.
just give us the file.
every time something unusual happened concerning Kyle, we managed to explain it or overlook it.
but there are too manyincidents. They have to add up.
to what?
well, that's what we're here to figure out.
what do you want?
Kyle told me you'd be around.
I think the family's starting to put things together.
Yeah, I heard.
what if they find out the truth?
well, they would, eventually.
it won't matter anyway.
they'd never turn their backs on Kyle.
we haven't.
unless they found out that he's been lying to them.
they'll never forgive him.
what is he supposed to do?
well, it was a nice setup while it lasted, but once he gets back, he'll have to move on.
whatever.
this can't lead anywhere, not anymore.
we're here. We might as well check it out.
how far are we supposed to go?
as far as we can.
you really believe, don't you?
I don't know if we'll find anything, but we might.
I mean, there's a chance. There's hope.
I make things happen.
strange things, when I'm angry or upset.
like what?
I made lights explode.
I shattered a skylight.
you did?
not intentionally.
how do we do that?
it has to dowith harnessing energy and projecting itto the outside world.
and they made us this way, the people who created us?
being in the pod gave our brains more time to develop.
are we the only ones?
as far as I know.
I thought I was the only one until you came along.
competition.
I don't think of it that way.
maybe you should.
maybe I'm smarter...
stronger...faster.
the results of his mri when I first took him onas a patient showed an unprecedentedamount of brain activity, but the second mri, months later, was normal.
he sleeps in a tub.
let's start with that.
and I thinkwe can scratch normal off our kyle adjective list.
I'm less concernedabout his idiosyncrasies than
I am about someof the more disturbing things he's been involved with.
he was found wanderingnear kearn's skeleton.
professor kearntaught at u-dub, where he mentored a studentnamed adam baylin.
who looked just like kyle.
and kidnapped him, raising him for five years until he committed suicide.
and he comes to uswith no memory of any of this until his parentssuddenly show up, and he leaves with them. They're dead.
dad, you're creeping me out.
remember that basketball game where he scored all thoseawesome half-court jumpers?
okay, a bunch of people died.
but it's notlike kyle's responsible.
but they're allconnected to him.
he didn't sleepfor over a week. He jumped off our roof.
he predicted lightning, an earthquake. There are pages of this.
and don't forget, he drew a picture of my father's living roomperfectly, even thoughhe'd never been there.
no one should be ableto do any of these things, and yet kylehas done all of them.
because he's incredible.
he's amazing.
and you're acting like he'sdone something wrong, like he's some sort of freak.
we're just trying to makesense of what's happened.
don't put him on trialbefore he gets home.
give him a chance to explain.
that's what you dofor me and lori when you think we screwed up.
seriously, josh, when you hearall this stuff together, it sounds so wild and weird.
when you think about it, whatdo we really know about kyle?
I know. Who is he?
what are you talking about?
he's our brother.
he's your son.
and now, I'n not doing this anymore.
who'd live all the wayout here?
I think it may be somebodywho's expecting us.
you can't just walkinto someone's house.
I can.
Hello?
is anyone here?
are we in the right place?
I think so.
I know this book.
it's in Hungarian.
dad. - Yeah.
I know you didn't do anything.
I know you love mom. I should have neverdoubted you.
I'm so sorry.
sweetie.
thank you for apologizing.
I don't know how much longerwe should wait to go after him.
we don't know where he is.
why don't you try his cell?
I just did. He's still not picking up.
I know he was talkingto declan earlier, but he wouldn'ttell me anything.
you think declanhas something to tell?
he was mood swing central when kyle leftwith the petersons, and he only got worsewhen kyle came back.
this spot in the woods.
Declan went there with kyle, and they followedthese coordinates.
the numbers kyle keptrepeating under hypnosis.
that place in the woods. It could be the same.
same as what?
we didn't tell you guys, but we went to the woodsabout a month ago near victor falls, and there were thesefreaky underground tunnels we got stuck in.
tunnels?
like a bomb shelter.
Kyle said there wasnothing there but trees.
Oh, believe me, there's something there, and kyle really did notwant us to go-- kyle and declan.
doesn't seem like anyonestayed here in a while.
is that a closet?
we didn't check.
I think we just foundwhat we came for.
how do we get in?
there are a millionpossible combinations.
it's like a song.
the song.
the song in the juke box?
and from the backof the picture. That has to be it.
well, even if it is, we don't know how to play it.
I know someone who will.
where are you?
it's hard to explain.
I need your help.
sure. What's up?
do you know a songcalled she could be you?
no. Never heard of it.
do you think you could look it upand play the melody?
Kyle, what's this about?
I'm tryingto figure something out. That song could be the key.
tell her it's important.
are you with jessi?
Yes.
you're calling me for help, and you're outsomewhere with her?
Amanda, I- - that's completelyinappropriate.
I wish I could tell you why.
give it a shot.
all I can say is I'll never do anything to betray you.
you know I wouldn't ask you for this if it wasn't something I really needed.
you know how muchI care about you.
give me a few minutes.
got your message. What's going on?
we need you to tell usabout that place in the woods.
what place?
I've already told themabout that night.
we're not fooling around here.
Mr. Trager, I wish I could help, but I don't knowanything about it.
we're concerned about kyle, declan, and you seem to beinvolved in a lot of things we're trying to understandabout him.
like I said, I wish I could help.
that's it.
what are you doing?
somethingI should have done already. I'm calling the cops.
wait. Don't do that.
why shouldn't he?
don't call the police.
not if you carewhat happens to kyle.
get the hell out of my house.
Mr. Trager, it's okay.
he's looked out for kylefrom the beginning.
he's a friend.
you know what's going on.
Lori- - you lied. You've been lying.
I've been tryingto protect kyle.
from what?
I don't want to hearyour crap anymore. Get out.
get out!
please, listen to him.
okay. I foundthe music online.
you ready?
I'm listening.
is that what you needed?
that's perfect.
thank you, amanda.
you're welcome.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
will you be backin time to say good-bye?
I want to be.
she played it?
Yes.
you were right.
wait.
no matterwhat we find in there, you've done a lot for me, and I want to thank you.
you don't need to.
you've made me feel safe, and you've given me hope.
who is he?
I thought you saidadam baylin was dead.
I scattered his ashes.
I guess they weren't his.
why would theymake me believe that
I'm sure that youhave questions, but kyle should answer them.
no. You tell me now.
last time I saw you, brian taylor had you locked upin a room at madacorp. Why?
we had a disagreement.
what kind of answer is that?
all I can tell youis kyle's done nothing wrong.
you were our security guard, but declan said you looked outfor kyle from the beginning.
what did he mean?
that means...
I've known himsince he was a child.
he's been through a lot.
and he's very special, but you already know that.
do you know where he is? - I think so.
he's asked me to stay aroundto look after your family.
all he's ever wanted was to be a partof your family.
to kyle, this is home.
well, I can take careof my family.
it's time for you to go.
and bring our son home.
he knows I'm here.
I think we cancommunicate with him. I've done it before.
we can pick up the electrical impulsesin his brain, just like the monitor.
no.
I don't want to.
okay.
I'll try.
I really don't want to talk.
then just listen.
I know it's beena strange day.
it's been a strange year.
and remembering all the things that have happenedsince kyle's been with us, and knowing he's connectedto jessi in some way and the...
troublethat's caused us...
I just want to tell all of youthat I'm sorry.
you're sorry? What for?
I'm the one that broughtthem both into this house.
that's not your fault.
I was just so takenwith kyle, and I
I accepted thingsthat didn't make sense, and I allowedwanting to protect him to come between us.
I am so sorry, steven.
Hey.
it's okay.
we can get through anything, remember?
Yeah.
this isn't one of thosegroup hug moments, is it?
Josh, you were right before.
I was?
when we said we didn't knowwho kyle really is.
we know who he is. He's part of our family.
when he comes back, he'll explain.
so does that mean you're notgoing to call the cops?
hopefully, I won'thave a reason to.
so what do we do now?
we wait for kyle to come home.
is he communicating with you?
I think he's trying, but I'm not getting anything.
will you help me?
I don't know how.
don't be afraid.
open your mind.
and focus.
I needed to know why our journey had led us here.
hoping adam would guide us forward, I cleared my mind and opened my heart, trying to connect with him, strengthening the pathway with jessi's help.
while focused on adam, I felt all the barriers between us slip away, then a powerful exchange of energy as jessi reached into my mind and connected with me.
Kyle, stop. She's betrayed you.
no.
Jessi, wait!
why are you running?
I did it. I got into your head.
when you triedto connect with baylin, I tookwhat they wanted me to.
the information.
why did you take it?
I couldn't help myself.
you shouldn'thave trusted me.
No!
I have a lot of answers, and I'm ready to tell you everything.
all we have to do is protect the secret.
everything kyle told us, outside of the family, we can't talk about.
fine.
if you want to be the guy who keeps secrets from the girl who has cancer...
I hated lying to you, pretending that I didn't... - I forgive you.
that ring that you wear around your neck, the box you found at Baylin's, it all originated from Latnok.
they have Baylin's best interests, and mine, and yours.
I make things happen.
I made lights explode.
I shattered a skylight.
you did?
how did we do that?
what's the trick?
once you teach your mind to alter the positive and negative polarity of the cells in your body...
the glass will move.
not the glass.
the water inside it.
she looks happy.
that's not me.
I think it could be you someday.
how could you be my father?
it's time you learned the truth about who you really are.
Kyle's very special, but you already know that.
all he's ever wanted was to be a part of your family.
to kyle, this is home.
a new day.
the future full of promise.
now that my family knew all of my secrets,
I felt free, like I could do anything.
even while facing the future,
I knew there were some lessons from the past worth remembering.
as adam taught me,
I was able to manipulate the polarity of the cells in my body, using my own water content against the water on the ground, like two magnets fighting to come together.
beautiful day.
I spoke to Amanda yesterday.
she's doing great.
Yes.
Yes, she is.
have a nice day.
Mrs. Bloom thinks I can levitate.
can you?
not exactly.
I was trying to do something Adam taught me, and I think she saw.
you have to be careful, even in our backyard.
especially with a neighbor like Carol Bloom.
we have bigger problems than Mrs.Bloom.
Jessi starts back at school today.
well, just take the high road. Do your best to avoid her.
have you spoken to her since she moved in with Taylor?
no.
I still don't believe he's her father.
she doesn't have a real father.
she's another pod child like you.
genetically, she does match Taylor.
Yeah, but there are ways to fix paternity tests.
we know that from the Petersons.
well, until we can prove otherwise, I'm afraid we can't take any action.
is it really any of our business?
well, I want to be sure she's in the right situation.
and living with Brian Taylor isn't.
he lied when he brought Kyle back to us.
he was involved with Ballantine at Madacorp.
I know you're concerned abut Jessi, and if she needs our help, we're here.
but this family needs to focus on what's ahead.
Agreed?
agreed.
so what the hell are we supposed to talk about?
career days?
second best thing to summer break.
Why?
half days of school, dude.
free ride on the party express.
we're supposed to be browsing the career booths contemplating our futures.
what's to contemplate?
self-made millionaire.
homeless street musician.
global superhero.
let's waste some time!
he's right. These things are a waste of space.
why does Madacorp have a booth here?
don't worry. They do every year.
what the hell is Hillary doing?
coming at you from Beachwood's annual career fair,
I'm hillary, and I'm fabulous.
Hello, fabulous friends!
I thought that TV reality show rejected you already.
Oh, reality TV is so five minutes ago.
I'm on a new path.
sexy high school correspondent.
I'm gonna be the "queen of fabulous.
do they have a booth for that?
when did he get funny?
think about it.
Paris, Nicole, the "lonely15" chickie.
they're all famous because they're hot and visible.
it's not that hard.
that is both valid and delusional all at the the same time.
a few video blogs in the school's web site, and I'll be on my way to world-wide notoriety.
did you hear that?
it's party thirty.
Preston hid a few of his treats inside his gym locker.
now that is fabulous.
Kyle, are you coming?
Oh, no.
remember the puker from Declan's party?
this guy. - Eww!
then none for you, little cupcake. - Bye!
Lori was right.
I could do whatever I wanted.
engineering.
architecture.
medicine.
I had spent my life figuring out who I was, and now was my chance to figure out who I could become.
so what's a hottie like you doing in a place like this?
is that what counts for a pick-up line on your planet?
only for girls with pink hair.
I shudder to think what the redheads get.
what do you think?
I think you should wait to see if you actually lose your hair before you start wearing a wig.
meanwhile, let's bust out of here.
And?
lock ourselves in the bathroom and play g-force.
Nah.
when have you ever turned down an opportunity to kick my ass?
I wanna take a look around.
you mean, like, job search?
why so skeptical?
it would be just my luck to blow off the career fair, get cured of cancer, and be totally unprepared for my future.
okay.
is there something wrong with me believing I'll live to see my first crappy adult job?
Nope.
you hate the wig, don't you?
hate it.
and you think I'm ugly.
you're ugly, and you're disease-ridden.
I never want to touch you again.
you're totally getting the hang of me.
it's our thing, remember?
Mr. Trager.
leaving so soon?
I was just going to the bathroom.
of course you were.
why am I not surprised that this fair holds no interest for you?
wait!
I didn't expect to see you here.
just grabbing a few of my things.
could you just give me a minute?
I know what happened with Ballantine was horrible,
but his agenda was his own, not Madacorp's
and you were just following orders.
the point is he's gone, and I'm the one giving orders now.
Congratulations.
can we just put our personal differences aside and remember that Madacorp is, and always has been, a great company.
we're making huge strides.
state-of-the-art in every department.
and I want you to stay and continue to contribute.
I'll give you greater creative freedom, increase your support team and your salary.
you'll do very well at this job.
what we offer here you won't find anywhere else.
I'm counting on that.
are you interested in architecture?
this structure won't support 40 units.
try to move the foundation beams to the center to offset the weight distribution.
how the hell did you see that?
I read a lot.
Hey.
glad to be back?
sort of.
how are things going with taylor?
I know you don't trust him, but he's taking good care of me.
he told me all about the girl in the picture, Sara.
she was part of the original experiment, just like Adam.
Adam said he was the only one.
not according to Brian.
he said he created me from Sara's genetic material after she died based on Adam's experiments.
why didn't he mention her?
I don't know.
maybe you can ask him someday.
you didn't mention anything to taylor about adam being alive, did you?
no. You told me not to.
I know, but. - I'm different now.
you made me different.
if I make you a promise, I'm going to keep it.
okay.
are you as bored as I am?
no.
actually, there's a neurology booth that looked really interesting.
Kyle. - What?
I don't wanna spend the entire day thinking about what I'm gonna do 20 years from now.
well, what do you want to do?
just get out of here for a bit.
wanna come with?
come on.
my first day back, and I'm already suffocating.
you didn't exactly get a right start the first time around.
but it's a new beginning.
I think you'll learn to like it here.
well, everything we need to know, we can learn on our own.
not everything.
they definitely can't teach us to do the special things we can do.
have you busted any skylights lately?
haven't felt the urge.
exploded any lights?
been there, done that.
there's so much more we can try.
I mean, don't you ever feel like just busting out and doing something amazing ever now and then?
I kind of did this morning.
What'd you do?
I sort of levitated.
Really?
only slightly.
I don't care. Show me how.
I will.
but we can't start with that.
you have to work your way up to it.
no, I don't wanna work on anything.
I just wanna do something now.
there's not much we can do up here.
we should get back.
what, to the fascinating career fair?
you never know.
something might inspire you.
fine.
Amanda, hi, it's me.
sorry I missed you, but I've been thinking about you, and I wanted to call... uh...
I'll call you later.
fabulousness confirmed.
excuse me?
Hello! My newest video blog is on the school's web site, and it already has over 500 hits.
Wow. That's a big jump from the six who saw your last one.
I know, right?
at this rate, I'll be youtubed by dinner.
shoo shoo!
let the star see her work.
until next time, I'm Hillary, and I'm fabulous.
who is that ruining my shot?
please tell me you're not joining the wrestling team.
you don't exactly have the body to fill out those little outfits.
it's a punishment for blowing off the career fair, courtesy of our friendly neighborhood principal.
why do you continually do this to yourself?
cause it's the one thing I'm really good at?
what?
hooper's right.
I am lazy. My work ethic does suck, and I really don't care about school.
don't expect me to ride shotgun on your "woe is me" interstate.
you're smart, and you know it.
so get off your ass and start making something of yourself.
I could always follow in Hillary's footsteps and film myself in a low-cut halter top.
she's got a little more than her D-cup working for her.
she's got the mystery jumper.
the who?
some video trick.
it looks like someone's jumping off the roof.
what makes you so sure it's a trick?
do you know anyone who can actually jump off a roof?
hard to believe I'm being responsible, but how are we supposed to keep your secret if she's out there leaping tall buildings in a single...whatever.
I know it wasn't a smart thing to do, but I don't think anyone could tell it was her.
I ran a hyper-zoom processor on it, and I couldn't make out a face, just a female form.
just how I like it.
what?
I'm on empty, dude.
I've already told Andy all my secrets.
if she finds out I'm hiding something, she'll kill me.
I'll talk to Jessi.
Hi, Jessi.
everybody's talking about me.
they're talking about the mystery jumper.
there's a difference.
what should I do for my next trick?
how about nothing?
why not? It's fun.
no one knows it's me.
no one knows yet.
would it be so bad if they did?
I did something this morning that someone saw.
and by this afternoon, she had told three friends.
and if those three friends tell three more, by this weekend, I'll have half of seattle in my backyard waiting for me to do something extraordinary.
what's so wrong with that?
because then I won't be able to relax in my backyard.
I won't be able to enjoy a quiet breakfast with my family or a walk in the park with Amanda.
I wanna figure out what I'm gonna do with my life without people watching me, always waiting to see what I might do.
at least people would notice you.
Jessi, life shouldn't be about getting noticed.
look around.
that girl over there tosses her hair every time a new guy walks into the room.
and those guys?
they're pretending to read magazines.
but really they're waiting to see if the girl wiping the counter is looking at them.
and the girl wiping the counter is wearing a shirt that's two sizes too small so that the magazine guys will watch her.
Hillary's decided to make a career out of being fabulous because girls that look just like her are on most of the covers of the magazines they sell here.
so do you really think that life isn't about getting noticed?
please, Jessi.
for me.
no more tricks, okay?
promise?
I promise.
this message goes out to whoever faked that jump.
you're nothing but a circus act. A one-hit wonder.
by tomorrow, you'll be forgotten, and I'll still be here.
because I'm Hillary, and I'm fabulous.
we've got a problem.
Jessi was caught on video today jumping off the school roof.
off the roof?
Yeah.
the whole school's trying to figure out how it was done.
which one is it?
what do you mean, which?
well, they are two. The last one was posted an hour ago.
when lounging by the pool this spring, it's important for guys to know that board shorts are nothing more than manly.
did she just...
can you do that?
probably.
she has to quit showing off.
the whole world will wanna know about her.
I don't think Jessi would mind that.
but if they know about her, eventually, they'll know the truth about you.
it should be your choice if and when you want that to happen.
I don't.
not yet.
what are we gonna do?
Hey, look, it's her!
she's the mystery jumper!
Oh, hey!
Jessi, you gotta tell me.
how'd you pull off your last stunt?
stunt?
I studied the footage, and there's, like, there's no cables or wires.
did you do something CGI?
no, I just...did it.
you ran across water?
Mm-hmm.
I'm not believing that so much, but whatever, I'm totally hooked.
so, our terms are set.
first base, no tongue, to whoever figures out how the magician did her tricks.
is there any possibility for...
second base?
dazzle me and we'll see.
I don't think you should do this.
I'm not really gonna actually let any of them feel me up.
I mean give so much attention to Jessi.
she's a hot story right now.
and if I cover it, it puts the spotlight where it belongs:
back on me.
how do you think she actually did it?
maybe the better angle is why she did it.
well, that's obvious.
I mean, everyone's dying for their 15 minutes.
you know, fame.
I'm not.
please.
you just need a gimmick.
figure out what makes you special.
how are you different from everyone else?
I'll work on that.
Mr. Taylor.
Mrs. Trager, I'm surprised to see you here.
I'm surprised to be here.
is there a problem?
I'm concerned about Jessi.
Really?
what's your concern?
well, first of all, I don't know what your interest is in her.
well, she's my daughter.
scientifically, perhaps, but there's a lot more to parenting than DNA.
and based on her recent behavior, you haven't quite gotten a handle on it.
I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about.
she's been getting herself filmed doing things no person should be able to do.
it's on the school web site, the school blog.
you didn't know?
no.
if that gets out, you'll have reporters and photographers, and whoever else wants to analyze Jessi, showing up at your door.
it's only a matter of time before that kind of circus leads to Kyle.
I don't want that for him.
I don't want that for Jessi either.
look, you can't know every little thing your kids are doing.
you can't be with them 24 hours a day.
but you can hold them accountable for their actions.
if you really are Jessi's father, start acting like it.
there he is!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
excuse me.
you know that area you caught yesterday?
that saved my firm 10 mil in construction costs.
glad I could help.
no, my boss would love to have a sit-down with you.
a sit-down? - Yeah.
have you ever considered engineering?
I need to learn more about it.
look no further.
back off, folks.
I got first dibs.
forget them.
here's your future.
how to become a doctor.
a doctor?
Why?
Hello? So you can save andy.
with your mind, maybe you could find a cure for cancer.
I am definitely interested in medicine.
excellent.
and arts and physics and carpentry.
carpentry?
you wanna waste your smarts on lumber?
I think if you wanna help andy, you should become a doctor.
no offense, dude.
that's the stupidest thing you've ever said.
our brains are the same size.
I just use more of mine.
but it's so easy for you.
I barely passed science.
I'll help you.
Hi.
start with oncology.
On...what-ogy?
why are you here?
madacorp's always looking for students with potential.
and what do you know?
I just found one.
I don't want anything to do with Madacorp.
I was hoping I'd see you here today.
I don't know if it'll mean much, but for what it's worth, I wanted to say I'm sorry.
and I wanna make it up to you.
how?
work with me, and I'll make sure that you're appreciated.
people all over the world will be fascinated by your gifts.
you'd be respected and admired.
I mean, the possibilities are just so exciting.
we should sit down and go through them all.
I'd love to.
no.
why not?
we need to talk.
you know where to find me.
how could you get involved with Emily after everything she did?
you're just angry about the video.
you promised me you wouldn't do anything.
I don't wanna hide who I am.
who you are should be about your character, Jessi, not about impressing people with the things you can do.
don't tell me what do do anymore.
I'm just asking you to be careful.
I'll do what I want, and I'll be who I want.
you're right.
you do what's best for you...
and I'll do the same.
endless possibilities.
that's what scares me.
Kyle, you'll excel at anything you set your mind to.
you just have to choose what interests you.
it all interests me, that the problem.
maybe you're not destined to do just one thing.
look at Baylin.
he was a scientist, an inventor, philosopher, writer.
I wonder if he had a nosy neighbor and an uncontrollable friend.
I'm sure he had his own set of problems.
am I wrong, judging Jessi for what she's doing?
is it wrong for me to wanna keep this whole life to myself?
I guess that depends on your reasons for wanting to hide it.
I was watching this science documentary with Josh.
Josh watched a documentary?
it was hosted by one of those naked magazine rabbits.
bunnies.
okay, go on.
anyway, they kept a rat in a cage, and the scientists kept running tests and taking its blood and monitoring every mode that it made.
and you don't want that to happen to you.
but then again, the tests they ran on the rat helped them get closer to finding answers.
the rat didn't have a choice in the matter, so why should I?
I mean, I know there's people who don't approve of using the rat in the first place, but...
Kyle, you're a teenaged boy.
no one should be allowed to take your life away from you before you've had a chance to live it.
but why is my life more important than the rats?
because you're the kind of person who thinks to ask that question.
there should be laws against people like her.
pretty in the face, dark in the soul.
please!
she's not that pretty.
okay, she's kinda pretty.
here she comes. Try not to drool.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
so you made some new friends.
Oh, yeah.
isn't it great?
are you going to Preston's party this weekend?
or didn't you know?
I haven't really seen him, so...
I can't imagine he wouldn't invite you.
whatever. Preston's parties are so yesterday.
Really?
I heard they were...
a-list only.
well, see ya.
she totally grossed you.
are you going to Preston's party this weekend?
that's my line.
I saw the tapes.
and you're right. I...I don't know how to handle her.
I know what you must think of me, but...
I wanted to show you that I've come here in good faith.
where did you get this?
the day you sold it at the pawn shop, I went and bought it back.
I needed to keep it safe until you realized its importance.
it's a Latnok ring.
that's the symbol.
but if this is the ring that Adam gave me...
whose ring is this?
that's Ballantine's father's.
he was a member as well.
all the members received rings.
it was a way of identifying one another and the location of their safe house.
and you're a Latnok?
Yes.
I know that you think that I'm a bad guy, and I cannot deny that I've made some questionable decisions that may not have been in your best interest.
but right now, my main concern is Jessi's behavior.
you don't know anything about her.
how would you describe Adam Baylin?
warm.
brilliant. Caring.
do you use those words to describe Kyle?
Absolutely.
see, Adam came by all of that just naturally.
he had the kind of soul that people just instantly connected with.
Sara, she was different.
and Sara was Jessi's mother.
she was beautiful and brilliant and stubborn, impetuous, and volatile.
does it remind you of anybody that you know?
you don't have to like me.
but please, don't abandon Jessi.
she deserves better.
as did Sara.
illicit partying, daytime rebellion, fabulousness uncensored...
Hey!
aren't you in enough trouble?
I've cleaned 87 gym mats.
I'm already in hell.
why stop now?
Where's andy?
she's chosen this week to be responsible.
responsible during career days?
she's a rebel, what can I tell you?
Declan finally got that ankle of his fixed, huh?
well, well, well.
look at who the arthroscopic cat dragged in.
nice.
make fun of a disabled person.
you hurt yourself fleeing from a villainous Mega-corporation.
it's not exactly Helen Keller material.
you could feel sorry for me losing a basketball scholarship.
I've seen your house.
cry me a river, rich boy.
all right.
I hobbled my post-surgical self up here.
what's the occasion?
well, everyone's all aflutter over Jessi, the mystery jumper.
hence roof party.
we're celebrating the fact that Jessi's a maladjusted attention seeker?
no, we're just using it as an excuse to get out of career days.
I'm all for an excuse to avoid the future, but are we doing about Jessi?
Kyle's adopted a hands-off policy.
he thinks she'll learn her lesson on her own.
I hope he's right.
I've got the battle scars from keeping his identity a secret.
I'm not gonna be so psyched if Jessi's stunts start making headlines.
Hey, there's the mystery jumper.
Oh, great. - It's Jessi!
ready to wow us with another trick?
I don't do tricks.
come on. Here's your chance.
show everyone what you can do.
don't encourage her.
she's a poser.
I'm not a poser.
right! Sorry.
you're a superheroin schoolgirl's clothing.
don't make fun of me.
HILS, give it a rest.
why are you sticking up for me?
you don't even like me.
gee, I wonder why.
now, let's hear all the dirty laundry.
you can't be an attention whore and protect your privacy.
batgirl over here was the one who beat up Lori.
that...that wasn't me.
the hell it wasn't!
no, I mean... I'm not like that anymore.
of course not, because now you're the "mystery jumper."
I did jump.
total illusion.
HILS, stop.
Lori, she hurt you.
and now I'm gonna expose her for who she really is.
I really don't think that's... - fine.
I'll do it.
this is not gonna end well.
bad idea, Jessi.
Why?
everybody wants to see how I did it.
I'll show you.
no tricks, no wires.
get Kyle up here now.
Jessi, don't do it.
I've done it before.
don't worry about it.
you getting this?
we're rolling. - Right, then.
wait.
what are you doing?
I'm jumping, too.
Kyle, go away!
I wanna show them ho easy it is.
it isn't.
you can do it.
because I'm special.
how special are you if I can do it, too?
fine.
do it with me.
I'm gonna jump, too.
what?
you can't.
I'll beat you down there.
no. It's unsafe. You'll get hurt, then stop.
I know how to do this.
you're ruining it.
back off and let me go.
this is Jessi's moment.
thought so!
you got all that, didn't you?
every last humiliating bit.
I guess she did need all the ropes and wires.
another fraud exposed.
how'd you do it?
do what?
she jumped.
the only way out was down.
but she didn't fall.
I saw your face. I know you did something.
the human body is more than 50% water.
And?
that's it.
I...I don't get it.
study up on your science.
you'll figure it out.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you look bad in front of everyone.
they all laughed at me.
I didn't want you to jump.
I didn't want to jump either.
so why did you?
I felt like I was losing their approval.
and...
I didn't want to go back to how I was before.
what were you before?
invisible.
Jessi, you were never invisible to me.
because you know my secret.
you know that I'm special.
yes...
you are.
you're smart and adventurous and creative.
and you don't need to do tricks for people to see that.
and what if I don't even see it?
if there's one thing I've learned about life, from being here at this school and with my family, it's that the people with the most to offer usually believe in themselves the least.
you don't.
cause I have people that believe in me.
so will you if you let them.
you gotta give it to her.
career days a lot more interesting with Jessi around.
I still vote for shoving her back into the pod.
Oh, my god!
what's up with you?
the woman over there from the local cable station?
she saw my blog.
she said I pop on camera!
and she offered me an internship.
Hillary, that is fabulous!
now there'll be no living with you.
back to basics, huh?
enjoy it while it lasts.
I do.
I thought I made it clear that this fair is intended only for those students who are serious about their future.
do you know what? - I got this.
I am serious, Mr. Hooper.
maybe you're right about me.
maybe I am lazy, and I lack study skills, but I've changed, and I'm gonna do something important with my life and make a difference.
well, that's all I wanted to hear.
that's some serious gumption.
is that a good thing?
what got into to?
I made the decision.
I chose a career.
And?
call me Dr.Trager.
Really?
Yeah.
I wanna be the one to save you.
Josh, you realize you're looking at, like, ten more years of school before you actually become a doctor.
then I guess you're gonna have to stick around for quite a while.
the future was still wide open, and my choices still seemed limitless.
I knew that someday I might need to use my abilities more openly, as I had done to help Jessi, and that my gifts might invite attention.
but for now, I just felt lucky and content, because I could let my gifts evolve while I enjoyed the comfort of my home and family.
Oh, hi, Mrs.Bloom.
another beautiful day.
isn't it?
no worries.
decide to call it a night?
I'm pretty tired.
so how was school today?
it turned out okay.
you learn anything interesting?
I learned the most important thing is to be myself.
that's, uh...
that's a good lesson.
sleep well.
I'm glad you're here.
see you in the morning.
all right. Good night.
be careful, even in our backyard.
we have bigger problems than Mrs. Bloom.
Jessi starts back at school today.
I sort of levitated.
show me how.
I will.
she's the one who attacked me.
I know Lori will never forgive me.
you have to earn forgiveness.
she could be you.
what?
the two of you used to play that song all the time.
it's not there.
it's a Latnok Ring.
all the members received rings.
it was a way of identifying one another.
and you're Latnok?
Yes.
I got accepted into a music program in New York.
I leave in two days.
two days?
I miss this.
I miss you.
I didn't want to go back to how I was before.
how were you before?
invisible.
I'll call... and text and e-mail.
I'm gonna come back to you.
you promise?
promise.
spring cleaning- a curious ritual.
Nicole said it meant time to rid ourselves of things we didn't need anymore.
the first step is reflection.
what's worth keeping?
what's lost its value and can be given away?
for some, the choice is easy.
for others, much more difficult.
getting rid of all that.
actually, I've gone through, and...
I like all my things.
I don't want to give them away.
Oh, kyle, you don't have to, but...
a lot of this stuff has seen its best day.
look at this t-shirt.
it's shrunk, it's stained, it's faded.
I wore this the first time Stephen took me to work with him.
well... this one's torn.
I ripped it playing basketball with Josh.
great game.
the first gift Lori ever gave me.
sentimental pack rat. Great.
we're in trouble.
look, this isn't supposed to be torture.
consider it a chance to shed your old skin, be someone new.
dude, take a load off.
let's throw this puppy around for a few.
let me grab the rest of the boxes first.
the boxes aren't going anywhere.
but I told Nicole that I...
the best part about spring cleaning is ditching out on spring cleaning.
you can't do it, can ya?
you always have to do the right thing.
and you always find a way of putting fun before work.
alphabetical order, my encyclopedic friend.
but I will have you know, I'm done with my room.
and I'm trashing this with the rest of my stuff.
but first...
bite marks. - Foam.
it irresistible.
come on. Show me what you got.
okay.
keep going.
more.
you didn't tell me you were coming.
no one knows.
I'm surprising my mom for her birthday.
you're a good present.
how's New York?
amazing. Everything I imagined.
and the music program?
the teachers are all so inspiring.
and the students there are so talented.
like you.
they've all had incredible training.
it was intimidating at first, but I know I'm in good company.
I'm learning about composers I never knew.
Amanda's heart was beating rapidly, and she was speaking really fast.
she seemed happy, but I could sense that she was troubled. - I'm already a better technical player.
is everything all right?
I can never hide anything from you.
but I need to let my mom know I'm home.
can we get together later?
of course.
good.
I guess we need to talk.
she said what?
we need to talk.
nothing.
no, I missed something.
well, when someone says,"we need to talk,"
sometimes it's a lead in to a discussion about feelings that have changed.
feelings?
prepare yourself, dude.
she's dumping you.
at least she has the decency to do it in person.
don't read into it.
just wait and hear what she has to say.
no. Not my lucky shirt.
Josh, you've outgrown it.
I couldn't help but wonder...
had amanda already outgrown me?
okay, grab hold of the wire and make these babies blink.
what?
you turned a block full of headlights on.
this should be easy.
are you serious?
you said I look for ways to slack off.
this I take seriously.
you have to challenge that brilliant mind of yours, and someone has to fill in for that Foss guy, right?
well, that someone, my friend, will be me.
Really?
just- Make 'em blink.
is it working?
not really.
thinking about Amanda drained all the voltage out of him.
Yeah, I heard.
we need to talk.
sorry she left you hanging.
typical woman.
um, anyway...
I need to look for my digital projector.
you giving that away, too?
no, I need it for a lecture I'm giving at U. W.
you're giving a lecture?
I mean... you're giving a lecture.
I've been asked to speak at a symposium tomorrow.
are you getting paid for this thing?
because you're supposed to bring home the bacon, dad, and I eat a lot of bacon.
for your information, Josh, I have already had a job offer.
this lecture is about showing my expertise...
for free.
well, I think your expertise is worth more than that.
thank you, kyle.
I'll let you two get back to work.
<DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADOLESCENT MORAL CODE>
what's that?
just an old magazine.
you done in your room?
Yep.
and now I need permission to boycott an assignment.
let me guess: Math.
Nope. Me.
my guidance counselor is making everyone write a two-page essay about who you really are.
I don't know the answer to that yet.
I mean, how old were you when you figured that out?
I'll let you know when I get there.
figuring out who you are is a constantly evolving process.
constantly evolving process.
that's three words. I need more.
how about "sarcastic," "moody," and "cynical"?
I didn't ask you.
and I'm not a cynic.
I am totally "glass is half full."
I just acknowledge that the other half of the glass is a desolate void of disappointment, misery, and regret.
preparing ahead makes me pragmatic.
uh, speaking of being prepared...
homework? Done.
I know.
you should call Ripley's.
I need an opinion.
I can't decide which one.
what do you guys think, plaid?
definitely.
Thanks.
you and Amanda should take a walk around the marina.
sunsets are really pretty.
maybe we will.
dead man walking.
hello.
can I come in?
there's a front door.
I wanted to see you. This is quicker.
what happened?
Oh, I- I slipped and hit my shoulder.
jumping off another roof?
Kyle, I've learned my lesson.
and I'm here to learn another one.
you said I have to work my way up to do things like levitate, so start teaching me.
I can't.
there's nobody around.
I have plans tonight with Amanda.
Oh, Amanda. She's home?
as a surprise.
you're anxious about it.
your heart's beating really fast, I can tell.
she told me,"we need to talk."
so?
you don't think that means anything?
it means she wants to talk to you?
isn't that a good thing?
that's what I thought.
so, uh, when can we get started?
when Amanda goes back, I'll have time.
okay. Well...
good-bye. - Bye.
ready?
Kyle, I can't go out.
but you said we need to talk.
I'm sorry. I can't see you.
Amanda? Inside!
this is all your fault.
what?
my daughter flying clear across the country to surprise me.
you're not happy she's home?
I'd be happy if she hadn't used my birthday as an excuse to tell me she wants to drop out.
drop out of the conservatory? Why?
as if you didn't know you're the reason.
she didn't say anything to me about it.
we haven't even had a chance to talk.
you're not gonna get that chance.
you will not see or speak to Amanda until she's back where she belongs, at that school.
I don't understand why she won't let me speak to Amanda.
well, unfortunately, Mrs. Bloom sees you as a distraction.
I just want to know what happened, make sure she's okay.
well, put yourself in Mrs. Bloom's shoes.
what I mean is, try to see things from her perspective.
that music conservatory sounds like a pretty big opportunity, one that Amanda shouldn't miss.
I don't want her to miss it.
but Mrs. Bloom shouldn't force her to go back.
Kyle, I'm afraid Mrs. Bloom has every right to send Amanda back whether she wants to go or not.
just as she has the right to ask you to stay away.
and the hard truth is...
it's really none of our business.
you know what Amanda means to me.
if she's struggling with, or confused about something, how could it be none of my business?
I know you're bummed, but look at the bright side.
which, by the way, is my new M. O.
at least Amanda wasn't planning on dumping you.
how do you know that?
Mrs. Bloom blames you for ruining her life.
it seems to me like Amanda flying home was a case of "girl missing boy next door."
but we don't know that.
we don't know anything Amanda's feeling.
no one's letting her explain.
even mom and dad.
I can't believe they're siding with Mrs. Bloom.
I can't believe we're siding with Carol Bloom.
she's uptight, narrow-minded.
Yeah, and those are her good qualities.
well, like it or not, we have to respect what she wants for her daughter.
but Kyle has shown nothing but love and concern for Amanda.
and now we have to keep them apart?
the funny thing is, knowing Kyle, he'd make the situation a lot better if he were just allowed to talk to her.
you remember being Kyle's age?
when something like this takes over your whole life...
that's half the fun of being in love.
now we have to be the buzz kills, the grown-ups.
well, if this is what being a grown-up means.
it sucks.
why can't mom and dad do something?
they can't cross the line with Mrs. Bloom.
they're all about crossing the line when something's not fair.
go throw mom one of your "puppy dog in a thunderstorm" looks.
get her to change her mind.
they made it clear.
I have to obey Mrs. Bloom's request.
this isn't right.
I can't just stand back and do nothing.
Kyle, do I detect defiance?
genius joins the dark side.
I've got a list of rules I've been dying for you to break.
I don't want to break any rules.
I won't have to.
I'll do exactly what Mrs. Bloom asked me to do.
Atta boy, Kyle. Take a stand.
why are your feet on my bed?
there were still ways to contact Amanda without seeing or speaking to her.
I could easily circumvent Mrs. Bloom without leaving my own house.
no MESSAGES
did you get my text?
username Blocked By Parental Control
but it seemed she could find ways to thwart me just as easily.
if electronic messages weren't getting through, there would be no way for me to send a note or a letter without Mrs. Bloom intercepting it.
I couldn't see or speak to Amanda.
the written word was no longer an option.
but there were still a few notes I could send her way.
I hoped this message would get through, and she would at least know I was thinking about her.
I was just trying...
I know what you were doing.
I think you better come in now.
what? You want my music now, too?
you've already confiscated my phone and my computer.
I know this is hard for you to understand.
tthat you're keeping me prisoner?
you will leave this house when you agree to return to new york to become the extraordinary pianist you're meant to be.
mom, I'm not seven years old anymore.
you think I don't get that this is a great opportunity for me?
then why would you throw it away?
because it's not right for me now.
it's not what I want.
you don't know what you want.
dude...
the crispity, crunchity goodness in that bowl is long gone.
I'm not really hungry.
my essay sucks.
speaking of sucks...
what? I meant Shakespeare.
extra credit. Impressive.
impressive would be figuring out what language this was written in.
I thought Kyle might be able to translate, but...
well, what part are you at?
the part that says it's about two families and it's set in "fair verona."
that's the first two lines.
she lives exactly 38 feet 9 inches away, and I can't even tell her I'm sorry.
you could if she wasn't locked in her own house.
who else but Mrs. Bloom actually changes the alarm code to keep someone in?
I just hope Amanda doesn't feel as bad as I do.
looks like we have our own resident pair of star-crossed lovers.
the balcony scene's her favorite part of the play.
of course, it didn't end well for them.
so Romeo and Juliet did everything in their power to be together.
you guys know how this ends?
why didn't you say so?
this all began when Amanda said we needed to talk.
that's exactly what we're gonna do.
I can write my essay later.
whatever it is, I'm in.
wait a minute.
I'll do just about anything but that.
if you wanna help, you have to commit, take this seriously.
then let me drive the get away car instead.
or I could create a diversion or something.
Hey, you want in? Accept the assignment.
then I guess I'll see if I can borrow one of Andy's.
what can I do to help?
help what?
help Kyle have a night out with Amanda like you've been talking about.
how do you know what we've been talking about? You just sat down.
I listened in while I was sitting at that table over there.
I thought you had the copyright on that move.
I can do anything Kyle can do.
could you make out with Amanda?
cause that would be hot.
it's a common male fantasy to watch two women make out.
number six on popular top-ten lists, but it's not really backed by statistical evidence.
that's all really fascinating and everything, Kyle, but I think what she really needs to learn is the meaning of privacy.
bitchy, not cynical.
a total difference.
I was just trying to help.
actually, I think there is something you can do.
can I help you?
is Amanda home? I'm a friend.
I've seen you going in and out of the Trager house.
you're Lori's trampy friend.
Oh, no, that's Hillary.
well, whoever you are, Amanda is not allowed to have visitors.
Oh, but do tell Kyle,"nice try."
dad! - Josh!
guess who was a hit at the symposium?
I knew you'd be.
Yeah, I was a little nervous when I got there, but I look out and I see a room full of computer science geeks.
my peeps.
sounds like...
really fulfilling and fascinating stuff.
say, uh, why don't you take a load off, and I'll put that projector away for you.
sure. Thanks.
that's our block?
on a map of the power grid.
there's our house. And Amanda's.
and how does that help?
I need to know how the neighborhood is wired.
this has high-voltage cables, transformers, utility lines, breaker panels.
it's part of the plan.
I'm back.
Jessi, please try to use the...
front door. Right.
how'd it go?
so, uh, I'll see you at the rack later?
okay. Bye.
she was done, right?
I should probably get going.
um, didn't you just leave?
I wanted to talk to you, and, um...
Kyle said that I should...
use the front door.
okay.
your parents didn't press charges, and they could have.
they understand that what I did to you wasn't me.
and I'm really lucky that they do.
Yeah, you are.
Kyle explained everything to you.
I didn't want to beat you up.
it was my programming.
things... went wrong.
so, what, you caused the most traumatic experience of my life, and now you're telling me that it's not your fault?
I'm telling you I'm sorry.
I'm not here to ruin things anymore.
I'm here to help.
I'm trying.
then I guess I can try, too.
okay.
want some help?
dig in.
Hey, I thought you got rid of this.
I got a little nostalgic and rescued it from the reject pile.
I got a little nostalgic myself today.
being back on campus again, no office politics, no corporate crap, just this flow of ideas.
it was a real give-and-take.
I forgot how satisfying that can be.
it's been a long time since you talked about teaching.
Yeah, I know.
I was surprised when the feeling hit me.
I was also surprised when the head of the computer science program mentioned an adjunct professorship.
Stephen, that's great. Two job offers.
no, no, no, just the one. I turned it down.
Why?
well, you wanna get back in the public sector, and I already have a fantastic job.
I mean, it's a great salary.
I'd be the senior vp in charge of software development.
Yeah, at a company that makes elevator control panels.
well, it's not as exciting as a career change, I admit, but at least this time around, I won't have an evil boss.
how'd it go?
mission accomplished.
excellent.
so far.
what you are planning here is so out there, there is no way everything will go right.
Suzy cynic.
Kyle, your plan is genius!
it's totally optimistic, at least what I understand of it.
thank you.
so what's next?
well, Jessi got the alarm code, and you got her to pull down the shade, so on to phase two.
here you go.
phase two.
now we just wait for dark.
I have unwavering faith and fully support your exploits, but how is that a plan?
you got something better?
it's just that there's a lot at stake for Kyle's sake, and I don't want anything to go wrong.
any why would that happen?
Kyle's covered all the angles.
I'm sure he has.
then why don't you just relax?
Kyle's plan has to work, otherwise he won't get to Amanda before she's gone for good.
I think phase two has been activated.
think about Amanda, how much you want to see her, to hold her...
to touch her.
Josh, eww.
what? He needs an emotional trigger.
the other thing I need is silence.
good idea. Lori, out!
what did I do?
this is man's work.
I so wanna make a joke right now.
she could have stayed.
Yeah, but I'm about to get all mushy, and I didn't want her to hear it.
listen, Kyle, I get how messed up you are right now.
if anybody told me I couldn't see Andy ever again, I'd be a mess, too.
but you've got to pull it together.
you really think I can do this?
knowing how much you care about Amanda?
zero doubts.
come on.
deep breaths, just take it slow, one bulb at a time.
by focusing, I could control the flow of electrons along the wire, much like driving a car along a narrow road.
in this case, the road led into the trager house's electrical system, which in turn connected to the neighborhood transformer.
through the transformer, I was able to reach Amanda's house and gain access to the house's electrical system.
once inside, I could direct the flow of electrons through the wires hidden in the walls.
I was able to find my way to Amanda's room.
finally, I got my message through.
and finally, we would have our chance to talk.
phase three.
meet ME AT THE RACK. ALARM CODE 12154
you owe me... big.
Trager, you really embraced your inner hallmark card.
you've gone soft.
I know. You can cut the irony with a spoon.
I just hope it's worth it.
what's that supposed to mean?
nothing.
all this for puppy love?
I mean, seriously, what are the odds that the person you're gonna spend the rest of your life with is literally the girl next door?
I mean, I don't want to put a bad mojo on the whole love vibe, but I don't want to set kyle up to get his heart chopped, sliced, and diced.
God, that felt good.
did you see where I put the napkins?
is there a garlic convention in here?
too much?
never.
what's the occasion?
take your pick.
I feel guilty about discouraging Kyle.
I appreciate the life we have and that we have such good kids.
I'm incredibly hungry.
how about all of the above?
you mentioned Amanda would be missing an opportunity.
you ever feel that way?
what makes you think I feel that way?
spring cleaning.
dragging the past out of the closets, seeing who we've become.
you still look great in a bikini.
I wouldn't know.
I haven't worn one since Josh was born.
remember how I was supposed to be the cool mom who published thought-provoking articles and had a career?
all I've accomplished this weekend is five loads of laundry.
not to mention an insanely aromatic marinara sauce.
Yes, there was a time when I wanted to teach, but I don't feel like I'm really missing anything, 'cause I never went down that path.
but you had to go the corporate route to support our family.
which I wouldn't trade for anything in the world.
why don't you go gather the troops.
all right. I'm on it.
is she coming?
I hope so. She got my message.
I know now is not the best time to ask, but can we add that electrical trick to the list?
I really want to learn that, too.
after Amanda goes back to New York, when you have more time.
I promise I'll make time.
but I have to make time for Amanda, too.
she might be staying.
Oh, she's staying?
she doesn't want to go back.
you're surprised.
no, it's- it's good news for you.
do you know why?
not yet, but now I have a chance to find out.
thank you...
for your help.
your dinner is getting cold.
I know you're not very happy with me right now, but I am only looking out for your best interests.
I made that noodle casserole you like so much.
Hey, hon?
where the hell are they?
this could be the biggest move you bust all night, so we just wanna make sure you have it down.
meet her at the door.
compliment her.
walk her over to the table.
offer her a seat.
Yes. Care to demonstrate?
would you like a seat?
no. No, no.
you have to pull the chair out for her.
and then just slip it underneath her as she sits.
not too fast or you'll take her out at the knees.
right. Not too fast.
why am I even worried?
you'll be fine.
does it look okay?
perfect.
I love this.
the lights, the table, everything.
and the window in my room. How'd you even get the idea for that?
Romeo and Juliet.
act 2, scene 2, line 2.
the balcony scene. That's
your favorite scene in the play.
I like that you pay attention to weird little details like that.
you do?
you're blushing.
I am?
I shouldn't have said that. I totally embarrassed you.
no. Amanda...
you can always say whatever you want with me.
and asparagus, with shaved romano and pancetta.
I don't think this is what we ordered.
right.
cause nothing says romance like a smoked turkey wrap.
I took some liberties with the menu.
you made this?
no one knows I'm secretly a fan of top chef.
and no one ever will.
stop staring.
I can't. I'm O. Ding on suspense.
I wonder how it's going.
you wanna know if it's going badly.
what you witnessed earlier was a completely uncharacteristic outburst.
no, it's how you really feel.
it was just a mini meltdown brought on by some stupid homework assignment.
the "Who you really are" essay?
no one ever takes that seriously.
well, almost no one.
it was recently brought to my attention that
I am always the girl with the wry commentary and the patented eye roll.
honest question.
do you think I'm a cynic?
honest answer? Absolutely.
you're Miss possible but not likely.
about my own life? Of course.
but watching those two, who am I to say they're not meant for each other?
I mean, look at them.
have you ever seen two people look at each other like Kyle and Amanda?
not in a while.
Amanda, you said we need to talk.
right.
you didn't think I meant...
maybe a little.
after a few people weighed in.
the one time you didn't take my words literally.
did you really think my feelings had changed?
is that why you brought me here?
I brought you here 'cause everyone else was making assumptions about what you wanted, and how you were feeling and what was right for you.
but no one was actually asking you.
that's why my feelings for you could never change.
didn't know the lights out here twinkled.
only for you.
you have no idea how disappointed I am right now!
Mom-save your excuses!
your flight leaves in less than two hours.
my flight-you heard me.
but you haven't heard her.
you have nothing to say in the matter!
but I do!
don't you even care? I'm not happy at the conservatory.
of course I care!
but I also care about scholarships, opportunities.
I care about your future.
if you really cared about my future, you would not have sold my piano in the first place!
mom, I'm sorry. I didn't
get in the car, now.
I have to go.
I understand.
I hope you're satisfied.
it took all my will power not to trip her.
thank you for letting me know Amanda was here.
glad I could help.
welcome home.
I'd ask you what you were thinking, but I don't think you were thinking at all.
actually, this took a great deal of planning.
not helping.
the Blooms' situation was private.
we made it very clear you were not to see Amanda.
you were not to get involved.
I know I broke a rule, but I'm not sorry I did.
I had to do it, for Amanda.
good intentions aside, you're still grounded.
all of you. Two weeks.
what?
school, work, home.
everything else is off-limits.
and I'll take your cell phones.
this was my idea.
Lori and Josh shouldn't be punished.
they were just helping.
exactly.
what if Foss...
if anyone important calls, I'll have it with me.
do I get one last call? - No.
but you do get to go to your rooms.
now.
grounding Kyle.
who would have expected it?
and he was the ringleader.
when did that start happening?
be honest.
you're kinda glad they did it, aren't you?
aren't you?
some rules are meant to be broken.
about that.
I think we should break some rules, too.
Stephen, I don't want us to sail into a complacent, suburban existence without fighting the good fight.
I want you to pursue that opportunity at U. W.
Nicole, that's not an option.
well, then we need to make it one.
you can't get the chance to pursue an old dream and just pass on it.
we have mouths to feed.
we'll keep them fed.
we'll make it work. We always do.
spring cleaning isn't just about sorting through things and getting rid of clutter.
it's about taking stock of who you are and how others see you.
who am I?
it's a chance to redefine yourself, to change expectations.
or to aim for who you want to be.
take a seat.
where have you been?
I was just out looking at the stars.
you were stargazing every night this week.
how about the truth now.
I've been sneaking out.
obviously.
Why?
to try things.
such as?
I've been testing myself.
getting stronger and faster.
I know I shouldn't let people see me, and that's why I do it at night.
I-I don't know what to say.
I expected that it would take you longer to get comfortable living here before we were ready.
we?
I have big plans for you, Jessi.
and I need you to be as strong and as smart as you can possibly be.
how do we start?
well, first thing's first.
you need to get some sleep.
we'll talk about it further in the morning.
okay.
Amanda. I'm sorry...
you have an instant message. Do you want to read it now?
listen.
who is this?
Amanda. What happened?
did your mother change her mind?
no.
I didn't get on the plane.
can you hide me?
come in.
when you first came here, everything in the world was new.
look at all you've learned.
look at all you've overcome.
tonight's a celebration of that.
just breathe and enjoy it.
don't use this.
you don't want me to have safe sex?
I do want you to have safe sex, but I don't want you to have sex at all.
I really wanted to have sex with you tonight.
I just don't think we should.
losing my virginity on prom night is the most clich? of all things clich?
this song is written by someone who knows a lot more about who she is and what life's all about than she will ever admit.
I don't know where you stand with me, or with what we're supposed to be or not be, but it's in your hands.
I think that means we shouldn't be together.
I think we should leave seattle.
where would we go? - Somewhere. Anywhere else.
I'm gonna miss you, jessi.
no, you're not.
because no matter where I am, we're always connected.
the people in latnok aren't bad.
they're simply scientists with a very clinical point of view.
he's incredible.
I think it's time we introduce ourselves.
I love you. - I love you, too.
Oh, I left my other clothes inside.
I'll get them.
got everything you need? - I do now.
put him under.
though we like to believe we have control of our lives, in a single moment, everything can change.
my night of celebration had suddenly turned, leaving me afraid and confused.
I was trapped.
and the only thing on my mind was "where was amanda?
Oh, the pain.
broken heart, broken feet.
broken heart?
she dumped declan.
dumped is inaccurate. We weren't an official couple anymore.
what happened?
let's just say he very graciously gave me the opportunity to move on.
which I took.
really.
I'm going to sleep.
what about the after-party?
give my regards to andy and the dimple twins.
where are kyle and amanda?
they went straight to the hotel, which would sound a whole lot hotter for any other couple.
wait a minute, what about you? How was your night?
dad, I have to swap clothes and meet andy.
I know, but anything... exciting to report?
if you're asking me about that...
candy bar you gave me, no worries.
it's still in the wrapper.
Josh, I know your father gave you a condom.
is there nothing sacred in this house?
I didn't mean to embarrass you.
but since we're on the subject...
rest assured, nothing remotely life-altering awaits me at the after-party.
even kyle's got a better shot at some excitement.
I couldn't search for amanda.
so I listened for her heartbeat.
but I could only hear voices talking about me.
he's non-responsive.
tell them he's ready to begin the procedure.
Brutus! Come here! Come here!
how did you do that?
it's just a dog.
I hope he, uh, I hope he didn't send you packing.
all the barking. It's a new place. He gets kind of jittery.
no, we didn't hear anything. We're just leaving.
we?
uh, me and my mother.
you and your mom. Cool.
vacation or...
incredibly nosy. I'm so sorry.
well, my laundry awaits, so I'm gonna get back to it.
cool.
when's a good time to us the machine?
the washing machine.
after midnight.
good to know. Cool.
have a good night.
you too.
you know, we could just hang out at home.
this is all part of the post-prom experience.
OK, just don't act all excited and weird. Try to fit in.
how hard can that be?
is it hot in here?
like the surface of the sun.
maybe we should just surrender and rip off all our clothes.
grapefruit. - What?
nothing.
g-force is the answer.
come here.
keep. It. Together.
wardrobe change. Much more comfortable.
are you ready for pome bubbly?
Where'd you get that?
compliments of the caterer, in exchange for a five-star review of his bistro on my blog.
you know, trager hates champagne.
it makes her nose tickle.
which is... actually kind of cute.
but I shouldn't be thinking about that, right?
I should be bouncing back.
bounce away, most definitely.
I should be having fun.
mindless fun, that is the goal.
what should we toast to?
to hangovers.
is that everything? - Yeah.
I guess everything I own fits in one bag.
it's good to travel light.
Jessi? What is it?
I don't know. I think there's something wrong with kyle.
you're just anxious about leaving.
no, he's in trouble. I can feel it.
I know this is hard and scary. For me, too.
you're gonna feel better once we get on the road.
I can't leave.
we have to get away from all this, jessi. We have to start our new life.
not until I see him.
please get in the car.
no.
I'll be back.
get him!
there's nowhere to run.
get him!
faster, josh. Don't stop.
almost there, almost...
lost it.
Hey, I was hitting that little button as fast as I could.
you gotta keep hitting that, trager.
it sounds gross when you "trager" me. Please don'T.
we need more whipped cream.
whipped cream, huh?
looks like your night's going good, trager.
the whipped cream, unfortunately, is destined for the sundaes.
how come?
my prom night's turned out to be totally g-rated.
and you were hoping for an R.
at least.
I want to... you know, badly. Really, really badly.
and sometimes I think she does too, because she says these things...
so what's the problem?
in a moment of colossal stupidity, I panicked and told her I'm not ready for sex.
but now...
you want to know how to proceed?
here's what you do. Forget about tonight.
you killed the mood, torpedoed your own sub, kicked the lock shut on her chastity belt.
what are you talking about?
was that even advice?
the truth hurts. Later, trager.
dude, quit saying that!
I hoped that somehow amanda was home, that she hadn't been part of what happened to me.
I couldn't hear amanda's heartbeat.
I had to check her room to know for sure she wasn't there.
I come bearing chamomile.
I thought it might help you sleep.
you just poured me a cup downstairs.
mom, you don't need an excuse to come check on me.
too obvious? So?
I'm fine.
I mean, I know life with declan has been a total seesaw.
but it's finally really over.
and I can never go back to him.
and I don't want to. I don't think.
did I just make a huge mistake?
Declan's been your safety net, and it's scary to be on your own.
actually, I kind of already like somebody else.
who?
she wasn't in her room, and I told mrs. Bloom she'd be home by 3: 00.
what if latnok took her?
what are you doing?
I'm calling the police.
mom, and tell them what?
Amanda is missing.
and how is that conversation gonna go?
Oh, hi, 911? My adopted son, the one with no bellybutton?
I think his prom date was abducted.
I see your point.
I can't just sit here.
any place she might have gone?
we were going to the after-party. I don't think she'd leave without me.
we should still check. - Josh is there.
let's not involve him just yet. - I'll go.
even if amanda's not there, I can ask if somebody saw anything.
thank you. - We'll find her.
my phone... - you left it here.
it's a text from amanda.
they have her.
where are you going?
to check out that building.
I'll go with you. - We both will.
no.
I returned to the building where they had kept me, expecting to find amanda.
I didn't know who I'd come up against, but I was prepared to do whatever was necessary to save her.
but she wasn't there.
everything...
and everyone...
was gone.
has anyone seen amanda bloom?
has anyone seen amanda bloom?
sweet blonde girl, probably the one assigning designated drivers.
so you came after all.
if you were already feeling like a loser, probably should have re-thunk the outfit.
ignoring you. Have you seen amanda around?
Yeah, she's been doing jell-o shots and swinging on a stripper's pole.
no, why? - Is something wrong?
Oh, no. God, no. Carry on.
this shampoo smells like her hair.
what are the chances that trager's shampoo would be in this hotel?
damn this shampoo, it's mocking me!
nugget, that is generic hotel shampoo.
definitely not something lori trager would use.
and this is exactly why I can't allow you to wallow in here alone.
there's room for two.
get up and let's go back to the party.
don't think so!
there's bubble bath.
not in this dress, muffin.
sorry.
I'm next door at the tragers, so if you cannot reach me on my cell then try calling me here.
do you have any idea what time it is?
 Almost 1: 00?
Oh, yes. You say that so calmly, as if your children are commonly out until all hours.
well, it is prom night.
I understand that, but amanda said she would check in at midnight and I have not heard from her yet.
I've been calling and calling, and she doesn't answer.
well, everyone's at the after-party.
 It's probably so loud she can't hear her phone.
what after-party? Where is that?
Why? - Why?
because I have to go there.
no, carol, no. I mean, please.
we're talking about kyle and amanda.
we don't have anything to worry aboet.
let the kids have thir fun.
I understand that you are very loose with your children, nicole, but I need to see for myself exactly what kind of fun they are having.
but stephen and I would love it if you would stay here with us.
with us?
cf course. We're waiting up, too.
in fact, we were just about to crack open a bottle of wine.
Carol, red or white? What's your pleasure?
you know, I don't partake... ordinarily.
but yes, I do think a little something just to help calm my nerves.
nice shiraz would be divine.
Jessi, I don't want you getting nvolved.
well, it's too late.
besides, how many times have you saved me?
I owe you a few.
where would they have taken her?
why would they want her?
it's all we've got, and I can't wait around for them to contact me again.
what... trace her cell. - It's turned off.
wait, you already know when this message was sent.
and I know what time we left the prom.
assuming they took amanda straight rom the school to where she is...
are you thinking what I'm thinking?
a radial tracking map.
Hey, did you see amanda after the... Wait.
am I in your cell? Have you programmed me?
uh, what did you say about amanda?
did you see her and kyle after the prom?
Yeah, he came into the gym and grabbed something. I didn't see her. No, why?
she borrowed my lip gloss.
well, this is an emergency.
you must need it for the after-party.
actually, I'd rather be home. - Home?
or you know... somewhere.
somewhere... where?
I gotta go.
booze is just a band-aid for a broken heart.
what you need is a hot and sweaty mack session.
with who? - Who cares?
as long as she's the anti-lori trager.
so just go out there, find a girl...
preferably a hot one.
but with your beer goggles it may not matter.
find her, and grab her, and just rebound. Simple.
simple.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!
No! No... he's drunk and I got wet.
that's ok. Stop there. Uh, have you seen amanda?
best guess, she's with kyle.
not so much, no.
I can help you look.
no, that's ok. Go back to your bathroom fiesta.
here's beachwood high.
if their best speed through the city was 30 miles an hour, this is the rthest they could have traveled.
right.
we need to narrow it down.
looks like the back wall is curved.
maybe it's some sort of round building?
here, play the sound.
is that a foghorn?
I can make it louder.
what's that popping noise?
a train.
it's not a foghorn. It's a train horn at a railroad crossing.
if we can find that, we can find her.
that's 350 points fob carol. I guess that makes you the winner. Again.
I would have never taken you two for word buzzers.
shall we play again?
I think I'm all buzzed out.
Hello?
I haven't found her but I need your hel.
can you log on to view-it earth?
hang on.
who on earth would be calling at this hour?
work.
we need a cylindrical building, maybe some sort of silo, within 200 feet of the railroad tracks, and somewhere between cedar and blanchard.
I'm looking.
a 3: 00am curfew. What was I thinking?
looks like something on the corner of 5th and dexter.
thank you.
OK, so I was all up and through that after-prom, and no one has seen amanda...
dancing like that.
she and kyle are just... just dancing.
a respectable distance from each other, having an awesome time.
well, shall we pop another?
I'm awfully parched. - Sure.
how do we get in?
we'll have to wait until they go back inside.
this could take awhile.
we'll slip past them.
no, they'll see us.
no, they won'T.
great, now we can't see either.
enhance your vision.
this is amazing.
you've been holding out on me.
what are you worried about?
I got wasted and I screwed up.
if anything, lori hates me.
you don't understand.
she's my bff and your on-again, off-again.
Yeah, and her and me are off again for good.
so what does it matter?
it matters, absolutely!
Yes, I may have transgressed in the past, but under no circumstances will I ever hook up with my best friend's ex.
she may have made a major mistake by rejecting you, even though you're this incredible guy that went to great lengths to win her over.
but I will not, cannot allow myself to like you.
are we clear?
so what do you think? Wrap it up?
Yeah. I don't have the heart to kill you any more ways tonight.
the lost puppy dog look. Let me guess.
you're thinking, are we really gonna be that couple who went to prom and played video games all night?
maybe. A little.
but only because you look so hot and everyone else is doing it, which is not an argument I imagine you're gonna fly with right now.
is it?
you're the one who didn't want to.
you didn't want to either.
but you went on the record first.
total jerk.
so you really did want to? Do?
do you?
there are so many arguments against.
I know, the clich? of it all.
there's that. And there's the what happens after?
I... I just want to get to the during.
Seriously.
say you have this amazing pair of jeans.
you love them. They feel great and they hug your ass.
and then you cut them off to make shorts.
you can't ever get them back.
so... we're the comfortable, ass-hugging jeans.
but what if we're not great as shorts?
exactly.
and I would hate myself if I gave up a great pair of jeans for some sucky, raggedy cut-offs.
I think the jeans are worth cutting so we could try them on as shorts at least once.
Josh, it'll happen when it's right.
not because it's prom night or because we're supposed to, but when everything comes together in the moment, we'll feel it. We'll just know.
how will we find her?
I'll hear her heartbeat.
come on.
security to the front gate... - I'll handle this.
no. Jessi...
we don't have time to argue. - Then listen to me.
next time, we do it my way.
I don't want you to get hurt.
don't worry about me. - Jessi.
if we have to separate, get out and head straight back to sarah.
Kyle... - promise me.
I need to know you'll be safe.
I promise.
you kbow, it's only a matter of time 'till they realize we're here.
and when that happens, you'll have to fight.
see what I mean?
we do it my way.
no choice.
I like my way better.
I can hear it now. It's amanda.
Jessi, go. - No. I'll be fine.
go get your prom date.
what do they want from him?
please... They have a plan.
what plan?
I don't know.
Amanda! - Security breach in corridor six.
security breach in corridor six.
Kyle! They're coming. Go!
there they are!
take her.
put her down!
put the girl down. - Go!
put him in the chair.
it was a rubber bullet.
waited a long time to meet you, kyle.
I'm glad you're here.
what is this?
you've been through a lot tonight.
but you were amazing, man.
you handled everything we threw at you.
what do you mean?
the way you used and controlled your abilities,  even though you were upset about amanda.
she'll be fine, by the way.
you planned all of this?
you've got a big future here, kyle.
we have a lot we need to talk about.
I don't want anything to do with you.
look... you're angry. Fair enough.
our methods can seem a little... extreme.
you took me. You've frightened my family! You took amanda!
 She won't remember a thing.
don't ever go near her again.
we're not the enemy, kyle.
we just want to know you.
 Work with you.
no. I'll never be part of this.
it's too much to take in for one night.
here... give him her bag.
don't forget your bowtie.
they'll charge you an arm and a leg if you forget it. Go home.
They're all waiting.
see you around.
I don't want to wake them.
here's my key.
at least you didn't lose it.
 That again?
I meant your key. You found your key. I swear.
what?
nothing. I just...
I don't know.
something about the way...
 this was the best night
it was, wasn't it?
and, now it's over.
Yeah.
so, I guess, good night?
right.
well, don't make me ask you for one.
one what? - A hug.
a hug? Absolutely.
 Jessi, what are you doing here?
I couldn't leave without you.
Amanda... - no, she's here. She's fine.
I think she might be starting to wake up a little bit.
what time is it?
it's about 2: 30.
I have to get her home. - Wait, what happened? What did they want?
he'll do anything for the girl.
she'll do anything for him.
thanks for all your help.
did everything work out the way you wanted?
exactly.
they went to all that trouble to meet you... ...
and I was right there, but they didn't care about me.
Jessi, that's a good thing.
you need to go that way to get home to sarah.
I know.
will you be all right?
aren't I always?
thank you.
you'll be late.
Carol, please stay...
it's 2: 58, I need to see if she's back.
all right. I'll walk you home.
you need to stay here with your wife.
you're awake.
I must've fallen asleep at the after-party.
I'm sorry. Tonit must have been so boring for you.
I'm just glad to be standing here with you right now.
the whole night felt like a dream. Did I...
Amanda, you're home.
you had me very worried.
no need to worry, mrs. Bloom.
home by 3: 00, as promised.
and I'm supposed to be impressed that you followed my simple instructions?
was it everything you imagined?
better.
sorry. Did I scare you?
no, I...
you're still here? Obviously.
 You're standing right in front of me.
Yes, well... - thanks for the tip.
sure.
I never caught your name.
I'm cassidy.
have a good night.
Sarah, I'm home.
did I wake you?
no, I'm still awake.
not for long.
that spiked punch must have really done a number on me.
Amanda didn't remember what had happened at all.
you'll feel better in the morning.
I want to thank you, kyle.
my night was perfect.
sweet dreams.
the most important thing was we were home.
and she was safe.
and for her, only happy memories remained.
it's a text from Amanda.
Latnok. They have her.
you're leaving with Sarah tonight? - Yeah.
it's good to travel light.
I think there's something wrong with Kyle.
he's in trouble. I can't leave.
I don't know with me or with what we're supposed to be or not be, but it's in your hands.
I think that means that we shouldn't be together.
what you need is a hot and sweaty mack session.
with who?
who cares? Just rebound.
Oh, my god.
no. No.
no, that's OK. Go back to your bathroom fiesta.
my prom night's turning out to be a G-rated experience.
you were hoping for an R?
you're the one who didn't want to.
you didn't want to, either.
it'll happen when it's right.
when everything comes together in the moment, we'll feel it. We'll just know.
that spiked punch must have really done a number on me.
you'll feel better in the morning.
I want to thank you, Kyle. My night was perfect.
sweet dreams.
you took Amanda!
she won't remember a thing.
don't you ever go near her again!
we're not the enemy, Kyle.
we just want to know you, work with you.
I'll never be part of this.
see you around.
thirty-seven dollars and 26 cents.
that's it? I worked a double today.
eight hours minus lunch and two breaks, that's $5. 32 an hour.
I need to get a new job.
I've got to clean up the back and then we can go.
OK.
are you all right?
how'd you get by me?
Amanda, wait!
Kyle, help!
it's too late.
I felt like it was really happening.
it's anxiety.
Latnok really put you through the wringer.
and even though she was never in any real jeopardy, you still experienced the trauma of losing her.
I still can't get over what they did to you.
listen, Kyle, could you ask Jessi to have Sarah call me?
I've left her a dozen messages and I want to talk to her about this Latnok thing.
I've been trying to meet up with her all week.
I want to see her before they leave.
I hope they're OK.
this can't be easy.
let's face it. Sarah does sound a little weird.
Latnok put her through a lot in her life.
and she was right about them.
they didn't even listen when Adam Baylin told them to stay away.
you think they'll listen to you?
I don't know.
I guess that's why I'm having the nightmares.
maybe Foss could take care of it.
I knew never told him.
you're implying I'm not man enough to handle it?
that stings a little, Stephen.
you're kidding me, right?
Kyle, you ready for some summer street fair fun?
Josh Trager bus is leaving in five.
the Josh Trager bus still needs a new fuel pump.
right. The actual bus, then.
good day, parents. - Good day.
what is up with him?
no idea.
a total disaster. Best friend making out with ex-boyfriend.
what did they say about it?
nothing. I've been dodging both of them all week.
so, um, how many songs have you written about it?
nine. That's why I called you.
that's why you called me?
to exploit me for my musical genius?
Yeah. I mean, that's OK, right, exploiting you?
Yeah. Yeah. No, I thought maybe you, uh, you called for another reason.
like what?
like uh... Maybe you wanted to hang out with me.
what would make you that.
well, I don't know. Because I'm smart, I'm clever.
and I'm intuitive. And you're blushing.
I'm so not blushing. - Totally blushing.
crap. Are you going to make me ask you out?
uh, depends. Do you want to?
no. I was kind of hoping for the traditional gender roles here.
Oh, the guy asks the girl out.
the girl plays hard to get. - Something like that.
how about this? The guy asks the daughter of his boss and the boss kicks the guy's ass.
you're afraid of my dad.
well, your dad technically holds the keys to my future in his hand.
but I could ask him, you know, first.
you would do that?
I mean, if we're being traditional...
OK, no, yeah, all right. It's settled.
operation Date With Lori Trager is in effect.
Hey, Amanda, it's me.
I think I'm in the right spot, but you're not here.
just give me a call when you get this.
sorry I'm late. I got a late start this morning. I wasn't feeling well.
I came to talk to your mom.
she hasn't been returning my calls.
maybe she doesn't want to talk to you.
why wouldn't she?
I don't know. She's not really a talkative person.
you know, she keeps to herself a lot.
I understand. Still, this is important.
she's not here.
I'm happy to wait. May I come in?
Jessi, is everything OK?
Yeah, never better.
I know this is a difficult transition.
I don't think you know anything, Nicole. I think you should go.
Jessi, I'm coming inside.
suit yourself.
please don't tell Kyle.
you feeling OK?
it's this stupid headache I've had all week.
it's the world's longest spiked punch hangover.
let's get you some water.
you think they can tell?
tell what? - Tell that... you know.
that you're a man now?
when you say it like that it sounds stupid.
it is stupid.
a girl's considered a woman when she gets her period.
real nice. Real manly.
I just wonder if anyone can tell the difference.
you didn't tell anyone, did you?
I said I wouldn't. - Good. Don't.
did either of you drink the punch at prom?
I share enough germs with this one. No need to take on more.
they had already confiscated it when I heard the good news about it being spiked.
I don't know what was in it, but it really messed me up.
I can't remember anything about the end of the night.
I really hope I didn't embarrass myself at the after party.
you weren't at the after party.
we were there, weren't we?
of course you were. Andi just didn't see you. - But I...
nothing embarrassing other than being passed out.
well, look, a psychic. Come on, honey.
honey?
is there something I should know?
no. Nothing.
you're keeping a secret.
apparently, more than one.
I'm just helping Kyle out with a problem.
a lying to your girlfriend about who on prom night problem?
it's a long story.
which you were going to tell me when?
never. A man is bound by his honor.
Oh, for the love of God!
did you want me to continue?
Yes, please.
let's move on from all the secret stuff.
you'll come into a sudden windfall.
maybe you can go buy yourself some more honor, honey.
Amanda! - What?
where were you? I didn't see you. - I went to find a garbage can.
what's going on?
I thought for a second. - You're on edge.
there's something you're not telling me. - Amanda, I...
is it about the after party because Josh and Andi were being weird.
did something happen?
you have to tell me the truth!
I came out of the school after getting your bag and you weren't there.
you were just gone.
I was scared. I thought something had happened.
I don't remember this. - I know.
what then?
I looked everywhere for you.
when I finally found you, you were asleep, out cold.
where?
a ways away from the school.
I wandered off and passed out?
when I found you, you were fine.
so, we never actually went to the after party?
I took you home and you didn't remember anything.
you didn't say anything?
your mother was there. - You let me believe that I just...
Amanda, I'm sorry. - You lied to me!
I didn't want to ruin your perfect night.
you just did.
your turn.
OK, so... - We should go.
no.
Amanda... - I don't feel like going anywhere with you right now!
maybe you guys should check out the psychic.
Yeah. Yeah, she's really great.
you guys should totally check her out.
you should, because I'm going home now.
put your money on the table.
you don't want to be here.
no.
so, you don't believe?
it's scientific to predict a future action without having complete knowledge of all the variables.
perhaps, if you're only looking at it scientifically.
how else can I look at it?
faith. Fate. Intuition.
haven't you ever felt certain you knew something was going to happen?
I've sensed things.
there's always been an explanation.
a change in the weather, pattern of behaviors with a predictable outcome.
what about a gut feeling?
perhaps a dream? A nightmare?
you're afraid.
but it's not for yourself.
you know there's no one who can hurt you.
the only way to get to you is through those you love.
there is a girl.
your soul mate.
but you've missed the signs.
what signs?
I see something white and water. It's swimming.
rabbit.
rabbits don't swim.
the white rabbit will swim.
I don't understand.
how? When?
tonight.
be ready. Your soul mate is in danger.
could you tell if she was lying?
I don't know.
her heart rate was all over the place, but that could have just been from the trance.
well, you have to understand, empaths, the best ones, are usually just picking up on the cues from their subjects.
your anxiety must have been pouring out of you.
and she exploited it. She's a two-bit carnival hack.
but she knew about Amanda.
it's a con. She was deliberately vague.
why would someone do that?
it's an unfortunate reality.
people prey on the innocent.
if you ask me, they're all a bunch of crazies looking to make a buck.
again with the eavesdropping.
the sound carries.
what did she say to you?
she said I have a secret. Windfall. A secret windfall coming.
speaking of windfalls, you owe me 20 bucks for your fuel pump.
you're robbing me of my last bill, sir.
somehow I think you'll survive.
sweet. Another 20.
must have missed it when I counted my tips.
a windfall.
dude, 20 dollars is hardly the lottery.
I gotta go.
Hey, it...
make mine a double.
what's the matter with you?
unresolved friend drama.
you?
boyfriend problems.
do you think I'm too innocent?
is this a trick question?
Kyle treats me like I'm a child.
I'm this fragile thing that needs protecting.
number 27.
number 27?
I can break down relationship troubles into 42 parts.
the higher the number, the worse the problem.
what's number 42?
devastating breakup.
and number 27 is overprotective boyfriend?
followed shortly after by woman exerting independence.
what's wrong with that?
absolutely nothing. If you're the woman.
Hey, man. - Is Amanda here?
out back, talking to Hilary, the source of many of my current problems.
great.
would you like me to play wingwoman or should I skedaddle?
do you want to do something tonight?
you mean like a girl date?
I just... I need a break from Kyle for the night.
number 28, woman exerting independence.
Absolutely.
I have these tickets to this great band playing at the street fair.
I was gonna ask Lori and Declan, but...
actually, I was thinking, stay in, eat some chocolate, wallow our way throughThe Notebook.
that could be fun, too.
Lori still not talking to you?
neither is Hilary.
apparently, kissing your ex's friend is a major violation of something called "the girl code.
there's a girl code?
it was news to me, too.
I need to talk to Amanda.
may you have better luck with the female persuasion.
just give me a minute.
stay strong.
Hey, Hils.
you need to keep your distance. I can't be seen
this is ridiculous. I was drunk.
why can't we all pretend it didn't happen?
because it did happen!
and now my best friend isn't speaking to me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry it's some weird violation of the girl rule.
code.
whatever. But you and I are friends.
you helped me through everything with Lori.
don't bail on me now.
you have got to be kidding me.
Trager, come on.
come on, what? Choose a guy over your friend?
that's not what happened.
Lori, it wasn't her fault.
are you sure, because she has a history with the boys.
I can't believe you just went there.
well, that makes two of us.
I want to talk to you.
I'm not in the mood to talk right now.
Amanda, I understand that you're upset and I'm sorry.
look, I just need some time to think.
a night off.
Kyle, I'm not asking for your permission.
I think I really blew it.
Amanda's mad at me.
well, that's a first.
she doesn't want me, I don't want to let her out of my sight.
do I need to give you a lecture on the perils of stalking?
I have a terrible feeling something bad is going to happen to her.
earlier I think I saw that guy from Latnok, the one that kidnapped Amanda.
and then a psychic told me my soul mate was in danger.
the one from the street fair?
I saw her yesterday as a joke.
she didn't make She just kept babbling about...
what? - Nothing.
Declan, what?
she told me I'd be caught between enemy lines.
which didn't make any sense until just now.
Hello?
you're back.
I told the landlord I'd locked my keys inside.
thankfully, he'd never met Sarah and he just assumed I was her.
what are you doing?
I want you to come home with me.
I already said... - I know.
and I'm not gonna force you.
but Jessi, I've counseled a lot of teenagers over the years.
and I've seen them through some terrible situations.
some of them I've been able to help.
some of them I haven't.
I have never given up on any of them.
and I'm not giving up on you.
everybody else did. - No.
Sarah did. Just Sarah.
and the first thing that you and I are gonna work on is a way for you to understand that's not your fault.
but in order for that to happen, you're gonna have to come with me.
you're gonna have to trust me.
does Kyle know about Sarah?
not yet, but he should.
OK. I just need some time to pack.
OK.
what are you doing here?
I've been acting strange and keeping things from you.
but I'm truly sorry.
I'm not in the mood to discuss it.
so, let's talk about it tonight.
cancel your plans and stay in with me.
I can't just cancel my plans.
please, Amanda, just spend tonight with me instead.
Why? Why is tonight so important?
I'm worried that something might happen to you.
one visit to the psychic and now you can predict the future?
she said that...
wait a minute. Is this actually about the psychic?
she said that tonight, when the white rabbit swims, my soul mate will be in danger.
Kyle, come on. Really.
you're so trusting of everyone.
you can't let that scam artist get to you.
you don't need to protect me. I'll be fine.
the psychic had warned me of bad things to come.
was it possible for someone to see danger?
had my nightmare been a way of predicting trouble for Amanda?
I needed to understand the message, decipher its meaning.
and more than anything, to keep Amanda safe.
even if I needed some help to do it.
the Little Mermaid, Cinderella, The Princess Diaries.
I'm sensing a theme here.
what do you mean?
never mind.
let girls' night commence.
what the hell is she doing here?
tuesday's pasta, Thursday's pot roast.
Where's Monday's chicken?
I think it's sprouted wings and flown the coop.
all right. I'll cook.
you'll what?
don't sound so surprised. Any moron can boil a noodle.
well, it's just so grown up of you to offer.
face the facts, Stephen, I'm growing up.
OK. First of all, Stephen is my name only to people your mother did not give birth to.
secondly, what the hell's going on with you? - Nothing.
nothing?
you're acting like you've been body swapped.
so, you're either up to something or...
my god. You're having sex.
what?
you're having sex. I can't believe I didn't see the signs. I'm such an idiot.
dad, I was... - You said it didn't happen.
well, actually...
I didn't think you could keep something like that from me.
Andi didn't want anybody to...
I trusted you, Josh. Damnit!
Hey, Mr. Trager.
mark, did we have a meeting?
no, actually. I came by... I wanted to, uh...
I wanted to talk to you about your daughter.
Oh, I feel for you, Mark, because if you're standing on my doorstep at this moment, about to ask permission to date my daughter, then you possibly have the worst timing in the history of the universe, so I'm gonna say no, one hundred percent, absolutely not, over my dead body, no. Got it?
I just wanted... - Good.
Oh, good. I'm all I just need... - Jessi. I need your help.
my help?
Amanda's at her house with the girls.
I need you to go over there and watch out for her.
you want me to help you with Amanda?
I know it's a lot to ask, but I have a feeling something bad is going to happen tonight and you're the only one that can protect her like I can.
please, Jessi. I need you.
Yeah, sure.
great. I'll text Lori and have her tell Amanda.
you OK? You seem like something's wrong.
no, no, I'll take care of it.
I'm sorry. I didn't know you guys were in a fight.
I swear I didn't plan this.
I think I'm gonna go.
so soon?
great. - What?
I forgot to tell you Jessi was coming.
Nicole, thank God you're home. - What's the matter?
while you were out saving a teenager I've lost control of ours.
Hey, how did everything go with Jessi?
great. I asked her to watch over Amanda for me tonight.
she needed to talk to you about something. She didn't mention it?
I guess I didn't give her the chance.
is she your new best friend now?
because if memory serves, she made out with Declan too, and then bitch slapped you.
for some reason the thing as bad as what you did.
I didn't do anything.
what?
Jessi, I'm so sorry.
for what?
you got what you wanted. Isn't that all that matters?
you know that's not true.
I should have noticed that you needed me.
look, I'm do I'm watching over your precious girlfriend.
I promise I'll make this right.
don't bother.
Hilary, do you still have tickets for that band?
Why? - Because we're going.
Hallelujah. - What's going on?
I'm not gonna stay in my own house and get spied on.
I wasn't spying, I was watching.
there's a difference.
not to me, there isn't. Let's go.
is she going?
not if you are.
you know what? I needed night. I needed a night off from Kyle with you two.
I'm gonna go alone if I have to.
you're not coming.
you can tell Kyle I'm off putting myself in danger.
I have to go, don't I? For Kyle.
lovely.
you've got a problem.
I'm in trouble. - That bad?
I really messed things up with Amanda, and now Jessi.
do I want to know what you did?
everything wrong.
that makes two of us.
they're going to see a band play but I don't know where.
you call Lori?
tried but her phone went to voicemail.
try again.
let me guess. Kyle?
no, it's Mark, actually. I'm just gonna...
Hi, Mark.
just tell me where you're going. That's all I need to know.
I'm just on my way to see Faber Drive play. Where are you?
Thanks.
OK, grea talking to you, too. Bye.
I'm really sorry.
uh, I was gonna call you tonight.
sort of wishing you just had.
I talked to your dad.
to say that it went horribly would be a massive understatement.
talked to her dad about what?
none of your business.
unbelievable.
you're giving me all this crap about Declan and you're busy lining up the DJ on the side?
the best friend, I presume.
you know what, Lori? You're a hypocrite.
I'm having a bad night. - We can talk later. Where you guys headed?
to see Faber Drive play. I'm sorry, I have to go.
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.
where are they all running off to?
Faber Drive's playing.
sounds like fun. Maybe I'll go check it out.
look, I'll take you wherever you want to go.
if she catches you following her, she'll hate you.
what if something happens and I'm not there?
ask yourself how much you really believe in the prediction of a street fair psychic.
what if I told you I could predict the future?
I've learned from experience never to doubt when you say you can do something.
so, what if, no matter how crazy it seems, the psychic is right?
what if Amanda really is in danger and I don't do everything I can to stop it?
what do you want to do?
I want to go to the Faber Drive show and watch over her. Just in case.
wait. They're going to Faber Drive?
Yes. - Man, we gotta go.
what's the matter?
the psychic, she saw water in her prediction? - Yes.
well, that band, they're playing on a boat.
here you are. Kyle? Put it out of your head.
we're gonna have fun, right?
how could it be anything but?
great. My headache's back.
it's not too late to go home.
no, I'm gonna do this.
so, the psychic was right. My secret wasn't safe.
I knew it. You couldn't help yourself.
you had to blab to the heavens you got laid.
I didn't blab to anyone. My dad figured it out.
your dad? Your parents know?
well, usually where one knows, the other follows.
Josh, this is a disaster.
for me, yes. Why are you so pissed?
every time your parents look at me they'll see the girl who's having sex with their son.
what if they tell my moms? They'll freak!
this d the end of the world.
no, but it's the end of our sex life.
what? Why?
it's just... I'm not ready for people to look at me like that.
like what?
like a walking statistic.
like a possible Juno in the making.
like every other idiot girl who gives it up too early and has to suffer consequences.
that's not gonna be me. I'm sorry.
I really am, but it, the sex, is done.
there you guys are. I'm glad I caught up with you.
good. You made it. Need a ticket?
I can't believe you just did that.
and I can't believe you refuse to speak to me over something that doesn't matter to you.
what doesn't matter? That Declan kissed you or that you let him?
I didn't let him.
I know what I saw. You liked it.
all right, fine. I liked it. Happy?
you dumped him. You decided he wasn't good enough for all your "woe is me, I need to find myself without you" crap.
that's not crap. - Face it, Lori.
you had a good guy and you blew it.
this whole thing's your fault.
it's not my fault. - Get off of me!
serves you right.
Oh, I hope that doesn't stain.
you so did not just do that.
Oh, I think I just did.
Lori, where is she? Where's Amanda?
she's in line for the... boat.
white rabbit swims...
are you two 12?
you followed me here?
don't flatter yourself.
you just happened to be at a party by yourself?
aren't you?
you feeling OK?
I should have seen that beam coming.
guess I was distracted with good reason.
I'm sorry, Jessi. I've been a terrible friend.
you didn't know.
but I should have.
you're always saying that we're the same.
I should have picked up on the fact that you were having problems.
you're right. You should have.
but I shouldn't have kept them from you, either.
Sarah just left? - Yep.
I would never do that to you.
you know that, right?
I know that.
why did you go after Amanda tonight?
you asked me to look after her for you, and I didn't want to let you down.
does it hurt?
a little.
is that better? - Yeah.
your girlfriend's waiting for you. You should go.
she's mad at me.
she'll get over it.
no one can stay mad at you.
I'll be right there.
I have to pick up Kyle and Jessi.
I'll stay here with Josh.
great, so you can yell at me some more?
I love you. We'll talk later.
sit.
OK, before you say anything, I have to tell you that I'm sorry.
you are? - Yeah.
when I gave you the condom I knew I was putting the choice in your hands.
I'm not upset that you had sex.
I mean, I'm a little upset.
but I'm mostly disappointed that you didn't feel like you could talk to me about it.
dad, come on, it's embarrassing.
it shouldn't be. It can be a great thing when it's right.
but I don't want you to feel like you have to handle this alone.
apparently, Andi was the one who couldn't handle it.
she's cut me off.
she has? I mean, she has?
girls are confusing.
Oh, this is only the beginning.
so, do you feel like you want to tell me more about it?
Yeah. Sure.
what's next, mud wrestling?
you can't stay mad at her forever.
what, are you choosing sides?
honestly, Trager, if I'd have known about this girl code, I never would have done it.
I was just drunk and feeling sorry for myself.
I wasn't trying to hurt you.
but I did and I'm sorry.
are you into her? - No!
I... I don't know. Maybe.
but it shouldn't matter.
you made the choice to move on.
it's not fair for you to hold me back.
I owe you an apology.
do you?
the psychic was right.
you were there to save the day.In spite of everything I did to make sure you weren't.
but I don't think the psychic predicted the future.
I think I created it. - How?
everything I did put you on that boat.
if I hadn't made you angry or had been a better friend to Jessi, neither of you would have been there.
but we were.
and it's funny.
what is?
the psychic said your soul mate would be in danger.
and after all was said and done, it wasn't me who needed saving.
it was Jessi.
my mom's here. Good night.
let's go home.
settling your tab? - Yes. Thanks for all your help.
it was a terrible joke to play on your friend.
well, that's why I paid you a little extra.
I felt him, you know.
that boy, he's special.
Yes, he is.
I see great things in his future.
it's a text from Amanda.
Latnok. They have her.
you're leaving with Sarah tonight? - Yeah.
it's good to travel light.
I think there's something wrong with Kyle.
he's in trouble. I can't leave.
I don't know with me or with what we're supposed to be or not be, but it's in your hands.
I think that means that we shouldn't be together.
what you need is a hot and sweaty mack session.
with who?
who cares? Just rebound.
Oh, my god.
no. No.
no, that's OK. Go back to your bathroom fiesta.
my prom night's turning out to be a G-rated experience.
you were hoping for an R?
you're the one who didn't want to.
you didn't want to, either.
it'll happen when it's right.
when everything comes together in the moment, we'll feel it. We'll just know.
that spiked punch must have really done a number on me.
you'll feel better in the morning.
I want to thank you, Kyle. My night was perfect.
sweet dreams.
you took Amanda!
she won't remember a thing.
don't you ever go near her again!
we're not the enemy, Kyle.
we just want to know you, work with you.
I'll never be part of this.
see you around.
thirty-seven dollars and 26 cents.
that's it? I worked a double today.
eight hours minus lunch and two breaks, that's $5. 32 an hour.
I need to get a new job.
I've got to clean up the back and then we can go.
OK.
are you all right?
how'd you get by me?
Amanda, wait!
Kyle, help!
it's too late.
I felt like it was really happening.
it's anxiety.
Latnok really put you through the wringer.
and even though she was never in any real jeopardy, you still experienced the trauma of losing her.
I still can't get over what they did to you.
listen, Kyle, could you ask Jessi to have Sarah call me?
I've left her a dozen messages and I want to talk to her about this Latnok thing.
I've been trying to meet up with her all week.
I want to see her before they leave.
I hope they're OK.
this can't be easy.
let's face it. Sarah does sound a little weird.
Latnok put her through a lot in her life.
and she was right about them.
they didn't even listen when Adam Baylin told them to stay away.
you think they'll listen to you?
I don't know.
I guess that's why I'm having the nightmares.
maybe Foss could take care of it.
I knew never told him.
you're implying I'm not man enough to handle it?
that stings a little, Stephen.
you're kidding me, right?
Kyle, you ready for some summer street fair fun?
Josh Trager bus is leaving in five.
the Josh Trager bus still needs a new fuel pump.
right. The actual bus, then.
good day, parents. - Good day.
what is up with him?
no idea.
a total disaster. Best friend making out with ex-boyfriend.
what did they say about it?
nothing. I've been dodging both of them all week.
so, um, how many songs have you written about it?
nine. That's why I called you.
that's why you called me?
to exploit me for my musical genius?
Yeah. I mean, that's OK, right, exploiting you?
Yeah. Yeah. No, I thought maybe you, uh, you called for another reason.
like what?
like uh... Maybe you wanted to hang out with me.
what would make you that.
well, I don't know. Because I'm smart, I'm clever.
and I'm intuitive. And you're blushing.
I'm so not blushing. - Totally blushing.
crap. Are you going to make me ask you out?
uh, depends. Do you want to?
no. I was kind of hoping for the traditional gender roles here.
Oh, the guy asks the girl out.
the girl plays hard to get. - Something like that.
how about this? The guy asks the daughter of his boss and the boss kicks the guy's ass.
you're afraid of my dad.
well, your dad technically holds the keys to my future in his hand.
but I could ask him, you know, first.
you would do that?
I mean, if we're being traditional...
OK, no, yeah, all right. It's settled.
operation Date With Lori Trager is in effect.
Hey, Amanda, it's me.
I think I'm in the right spot, but you're not here.
just give me a call when you get this.
sorry I'm late. I got a late start this morning. I wasn't feeling well.
I came to talk to your mom.
she hasn't been returning my calls.
maybe she doesn't want to talk to you.
why wouldn't she?
I don't know. She's not really a talkative person.
you know, she keeps to herself a lot.
I understand. Still, this is important.
she's not here.
I'm happy to wait. May I come in?
Jessi, is everything OK?
Yeah, never better.
I know this is a difficult transition.
I don't think you know anything, Nicole. I think you should go.
Jessi, I'm coming inside.
suit yourself.
please don't tell Kyle.
you feeling OK?
it's this stupid headache I've had all week.
it's the world's longest spiked punch hangover.
let's get you some water.
you think they can tell?
tell what? - Tell that... you know.
that you're a man now?
when you say it like that it sounds stupid.
it is stupid.
a girl's considered a woman when she gets her period.
real nice. Real manly.
I just wonder if anyone can tell the difference.
you didn't tell anyone, did you?
I said I wouldn't. - Good. Don't.
did either of you drink the punch at prom?
I share enough germs with this one. No need to take on more.
they had already confiscated it when I heard the good news about it being spiked.
I don't know what was in it, but it really messed me up.
I can't remember anything about the end of the night.
I really hope I didn't embarrass myself at the after party.
you weren't at the after party.
we were there, weren't we?
of course you were. Andi just didn't see you. - But I...
nothing embarrassing other than being passed out.
well, look, a psychic. Come on, honey.
honey?
is there something I should know?
no. Nothing.
you're keeping a secret.
apparently, more than one.
I'm just helping Kyle out with a problem.
a lying to your girlfriend about who on prom night problem?
it's a long story.
which you were going to tell me when?
never. A man is bound by his honor.
Oh, for the love of God!
did you want me to continue?
Yes, please.
let's move on from all the secret stuff.
you'll come into a sudden windfall.
maybe you can go buy yourself some more honor, honey.
Amanda! - What?
where were you? I didn't see you. - I went to find a garbage can.
what's going on?
I thought for a second. - You're on edge.
there's something you're not telling me. - Amanda, I...
is it about the after party because Josh and Andi were being weird.
did something happen?
you have to tell me the truth!
I came out of the school after getting your bag and you weren't there.
you were just gone.
I was scared. I thought something had happened.
I don't remember this. - I know.
what then?
I looked everywhere for you.
when I finally found you, you were asleep, out cold.
where?
a ways away from the school.
I wandered off and passed out?
when I found you, you were fine.
so, we never actually went to the after party?
I took you home and you didn't remember anything.
you didn't say anything?
your mother was there. - You let me believe that I just...
Amanda, I'm sorry. - You lied to me!
I didn't want to ruin your perfect night.
you just did.
your turn.
OK, so... - We should go.
no.
Amanda... - I don't feel like going anywhere with you right now!
maybe you guys should check out the psychic.
Yeah. Yeah, she's really great.
you guys should totally check her out.
you should, because I'm going home now.
put your money on the table.
you don't want to be here.
no.
so, you don't believe?
it's scientific to predict a future action without having complete knowledge of all the variables.
perhaps, if you're only looking at it scientifically.
how else can I look at it?
faith. Fate. Intuition.
haven't you ever felt certain you knew something was going to happen?
I've sensed things.
there's always been an explanation.
a change in the weather, pattern of behaviors with a predictable outcome.
what about a gut feeling?
perhaps a dream? A nightmare?
you're afraid.
but it's not for yourself.
you know there's no one who can hurt you.
the only way to get to you is through those you love.
there is a girl.
your soul mate.
but you've missed the signs.
what signs?
I see something white and water. It's swimming.
rabbit.
rabbits don't swim.
the white rabbit will swim.
I don't understand.
how? When?
tonight.
be ready. Your soul mate is in danger.
could you tell if she was lying?
I don't know.
her heart rate was all over the place, but that could have just been from the trance.
well, you have to understand, empaths, the best ones, are usually just picking up on the cues from their subjects.
your anxiety must have been pouring out of you.
and she exploited it. She's a two-bit carnival hack.
but she knew about Amanda.
it's a con. She was deliberately vague.
why would someone do that?
it's an unfortunate reality.
people prey on the innocent.
if you ask me, they're all a bunch of crazies looking to make a buck.
again with the eavesdropping.
the sound carries.
what did she say to you?
she said I have a secret. Windfall. A secret windfall coming.
speaking of windfalls, you owe me 20 bucks for your fuel pump.
you're robbing me of my last bill, sir.
somehow I think you'll survive.
sweet. Another 20.
must have missed it when I counted my tips.
a windfall.
dude, 20 dollars is hardly the lottery.
I gotta go.
Hey, it...
make mine a double.
what's the matter with you?
unresolved friend drama.
you?
boyfriend problems.
do you think I'm too innocent?
is this a trick question?
Kyle treats me like I'm a child.
I'm this fragile thing that needs protecting.
number 27.
number 27?
I can break down relationship troubles into 42 parts.
the higher the number, the worse the problem.
what's number 42?
devastating breakup.
and number 27 is overprotective boyfriend?
followed shortly after by woman exerting independence.
what's wrong with that?
absolutely nothing. If you're the woman.
Hey, man. - Is Amanda here?
out back, talking to Hilary, the source of many of my current problems.
great.
would you like me to play wingwoman or should I skedaddle?
do you want to do something tonight?
you mean like a girl date?
I just... I need a break from Kyle for the night.
number 28, woman exerting independence.
Absolutely.
I have these tickets to this great band playing at the street fair.
I was gonna ask Lori and Declan, but...
actually, I was thinking, stay in, eat some chocolate, wallow our way throughThe Notebook.
that could be fun, too.
Lori still not talking to you?
neither is Hilary.
apparently, kissing your ex's friend is a major violation of something called "the girl code.
there's a girl code?
it was news to me, too.
I need to talk to Amanda.
may you have better luck with the female persuasion.
just give me a minute.
stay strong.
Hey, Hils.
you need to keep your distance. I can't be seen
this is ridiculous. I was drunk.
why can't we all pretend it didn't happen?
because it did happen!
and now my best friend isn't speaking to me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry it's some weird violation of the girl rule.
code.
whatever. But you and I are friends.
you helped me through everything with Lori.
don't bail on me now.
you have got to be kidding me.
Trager, come on.
come on, what? Choose a guy over your friend?
that's not what happened.
Lori, it wasn't her fault.
are you sure, because she has a history with the boys.
I can't believe you just went there.
well, that makes two of us.
I want to talk to you.
I'm not in the mood to talk right now.
Amanda, I understand that you're upset and I'm sorry.
look, I just need some time to think.
a night off.
Kyle, I'm not asking for your permission.
I think I really blew it.
Amanda's mad at me.
well, that's a first.
she doesn't want me, I don't want to let her out of my sight.
do I need to give you a lecture on the perils of stalking?
I have a terrible feeling something bad is going to happen to her.
earlier I think I saw that guy from Latnok, the one that kidnapped Amanda.
and then a psychic told me my soul mate was in danger.
the one from the street fair?
I saw her yesterday as a joke.
she didn't make She just kept babbling about...
what? - Nothing.
Declan, what?
she told me I'd be caught between enemy lines.
which didn't make any sense until just now.
Hello?
you're back.
I told the landlord I'd locked my keys inside.
thankfully, he'd never met Sarah and he just assumed I was her.
what are you doing?
I want you to come home with me.
I already said... - I know.
and I'm not gonna force you.
but Jessi, I've counseled a lot of teenagers over the years.
and I've seen them through some terrible situations.
some of them I've been able to help.
some of them I haven't.
I have never given up on any of them.
and I'm not giving up on you.
everybody else did. - No.
Sarah did. Just Sarah.
and the first thing that you and I are gonna work on is a way for you to understand that's not your fault.
but in order for that to happen, you're gonna have to come with me.
you're gonna have to trust me.
does Kyle know about Sarah?
not yet, but he should.
OK. I just need some time to pack.
OK.
what are you doing here?
I've been acting strange and keeping things from you.
but I'm truly sorry.
I'm not in the mood to discuss it.
so, let's talk about it tonight.
cancel your plans and stay in with me.
I can't just cancel my plans.
please, Amanda, just spend tonight with me instead.
Why? Why is tonight so important?
I'm worried that something might happen to you.
one visit to the psychic and now you can predict the future?
she said that...
wait a minute. Is this actually about the psychic?
she said that tonight, when the white rabbit swims, my soul mate will be in danger.
Kyle, come on. Really.
you're so trusting of everyone.
you can't let that scam artist get to you.
you don't need to protect me. I'll be fine.
the psychic had warned me of bad things to come.
was it possible for someone to see danger?
had my nightmare been a way of predicting trouble for Amanda?
I needed to understand the message, decipher its meaning.
and more than anything, to keep Amanda safe.
even if I needed some help to do it.
the Little Mermaid, Cinderella, The Princess Diaries.
I'm sensing a theme here.
what do you mean?
never mind.
let girls' night commence.
what the hell is she doing here?
tuesday's pasta, Thursday's pot roast.
Where's Monday's chicken?
I think it's sprouted wings and flown the coop.
all right. I'll cook.
you'll what?
don't sound so surprised. Any moron can boil a noodle.
well, it's just so grown up of you to offer.
face the facts, Stephen, I'm growing up.
OK. First of all, Stephen is my name only to people your mother did not give birth to.
secondly, what the hell's going on with you? - Nothing.
nothing?
you're acting like you've been body swapped.
so, you're either up to something or...
my god. You're having sex.
what?
you're having sex. I can't believe I didn't see the signs. I'm such an idiot.
dad, I was... - You said it didn't happen.
well, actually...
I didn't think you could keep something like that from me.
Andi didn't want anybody to...
I trusted you, Josh. Damnit!
Hey, Mr. Trager.
mark, did we have a meeting?
no, actually. I came by... I wanted to, uh...
I wanted to talk to you about your daughter.
Oh, I feel for you, Mark, because if you're standing on my doorstep at this moment, about to ask permission to date my daughter, then you possibly have the worst timing in the history of the universe, so I'm gonna say no, one hundred percent, absolutely not, over my dead body, no. Got it?
I just wanted... - Good.
Oh, good. I'm all I just need... - Jessi. I need your help.
my help?
Amanda's at her house with the girls.
I need you to go over there and watch out for her.
you want me to help you with Amanda?
I know it's a lot to ask, but I have a feeling something bad is going to happen tonight and you're the only one that can protect her like I can.
please, Jessi. I need you.
Yeah, sure.
great. I'll text Lori and have her tell Amanda.
you OK? You seem like something's wrong.
no, no, I'll take care of it.
I'm sorry. I didn't know you guys were in a fight.
I swear I didn't plan this.
I think I'm gonna go.
so soon?
great. - What?
I forgot to tell you Jessi was coming.
Nicole, thank God you're home. - What's the matter?
while you were out saving a teenager I've lost control of ours.
Hey, how did everything go with Jessi?
great. I asked her to watch over Amanda for me tonight.
she needed to talk to you about something. She didn't mention it?
I guess I didn't give her the chance.
is she your new best friend now?
because if memory serves, she made out with Declan too, and then bitch slapped you.
for some reason the thing as bad as what you did.
I didn't do anything.
what?
Jessi, I'm so sorry.
for what?
you got what you wanted. Isn't that all that matters?
you know that's not true.
I should have noticed that you needed me.
look, I'm do I'm watching over your precious girlfriend.
I promise I'll make this right.
don't bother.
Hilary, do you still have tickets for that band?
Why? - Because we're going.
Hallelujah. - What's going on?
I'm not gonna stay in my own house and get spied on.
I wasn't spying, I was watching.
there's a difference.
not to me, there isn't. Let's go.
is she going?
not if you are.
you know what? I needed night. I needed a night off from Kyle with you two.
I'm gonna go alone if I have to.
you're not coming.
you can tell Kyle I'm off putting myself in danger.
I have to go, don't I? For Kyle.
lovely.
you've got a problem.
I'm in trouble. - That bad?
I really messed things up with Amanda, and now Jessi.
do I want to know what you did?
everything wrong.
that makes two of us.
they're going to see a band play but I don't know where.
you call Lori?
tried but her phone went to voicemail.
try again.
let me guess. Kyle?
no, it's Mark, actually. I'm just gonna...
Hi, Mark.
just tell me where you're going. That's all I need to know.
I'm just on my way to see Faber Drive play. Where are you?
Thanks.
OK, grea talking to you, too. Bye.
I'm really sorry.
uh, I was gonna call you tonight.
sort of wishing you just had.
I talked to your dad.
to say that it went horribly would be a massive understatement.
talked to her dad about what?
none of your business.
unbelievable.
you're giving me all this crap about Declan and you're busy lining up the DJ on the side?
the best friend, I presume.
you know what, Lori? You're a hypocrite.
I'm having a bad night. - We can talk later. Where you guys headed?
to see Faber Drive play. I'm sorry, I have to go.
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.
where are they all running off to?
Faber Drive's playing.
sounds like fun. Maybe I'll go check it out.
look, I'll take you wherever you want to go.
if she catches you following her, she'll hate you.
what if something happens and I'm not there?
ask yourself how much you really believe in the prediction of a street fair psychic.
what if I told you I could predict the future?
I've learned from experience never to doubt when you say you can do something.
so, what if, no matter how crazy it seems, the psychic is right?
what if Amanda really is in danger and I don't do everything I can to stop it?
what do you want to do?
I want to go to the Faber Drive show and watch over her. Just in case.
wait. They're going to Faber Drive?
Yes. - Man, we gotta go.
what's the matter?
the psychic, she saw water in her prediction? - Yes.
well, that band, they're playing on a boat.
here you are. Kyle? Put it out of your head.
we're gonna have fun, right?
how could it be anything but?
great. My headache's back.
it's not too late to go home.
no, I'm gonna do this.
so, the psychic was right. My secret wasn't safe.
I knew it. You couldn't help yourself.
you had to blab to the heavens you got laid.
I didn't blab to anyone. My dad figured it out.
your dad? Your parents know?
well, usually where one knows, the other follows.
Josh, this is a disaster.
for me, yes. Why are you so pissed?
every time your parents look at me they'll see the girl who's having sex with their son.
what if they tell my moms? They'll freak!
this d the end of the world.
no, but it's the end of our sex life.
what? Why?
it's just... I'm not ready for people to look at me like that.
like what?
like a walking statistic.
like a possible Juno in the making.
like every other idiot girl who gives it up too early and has to suffer consequences.
that's not gonna be me. I'm sorry.
I really am, but it, the sex, is done.
there you guys are. I'm glad I caught up with you.
good. You made it. Need a ticket?
I can't believe you just did that.
and I can't believe you refuse to speak to me over something that doesn't matter to you.
what doesn't matter? That Declan kissed you or that you let him?
I didn't let him.
I know what I saw. You liked it.
all right, fine. I liked it. Happy?
you dumped him. You decided he wasn't good enough for all your "woe is me, I need to find myself without you" crap.
that's not crap. - Face it, Lori.
you had a good guy and you blew it.
this whole thing's your fault.
it's not my fault. - Get off of me!
serves you right.
Oh, I hope that doesn't stain.
you so did not just do that.
Oh, I think I just did.
Lori, where is she? Where's Amanda?
she's in line for the... boat.
white rabbit swims...
are you two 12?
you followed me here?
don't flatter yourself.
you just happened to be at a party by yourself?
aren't you?
you feeling OK?
I should have seen that beam coming.
guess I was distracted with good reason.
I'm sorry, Jessi. I've been a terrible friend.
you didn't know.
but I should have.
you're always saying that we're the same.
I should have picked up on the fact that you were having problems.
you're right. You should have.
but I shouldn't have kept them from you, either.
Sarah just left? - Yep.
I would never do that to you.
you know that, right?
I know that.
why did you go after Amanda tonight?
you asked me to look after her for you, and I didn't want to let you down.
does it hurt?
a little.
is that better? - Yeah.
your girlfriend's waiting for you. You should go.
she's mad at me.
she'll get over it.
no one can stay mad at you.
I'll be right there.
I have to pick up Kyle and Jessi.
I'll stay here with Josh.
great, so you can yell at me some more?
I love you. We'll talk later.
sit.
OK, before you say anything, I have to tell you that I'm sorry.
you are? - Yeah.
when I gave you the condom I knew I was putting the choice in your hands.
I'm not upset that you had sex.
I mean, I'm a little upset.
but I'm mostly disappointed that you didn't feel like you could talk to me about it.
dad, come on, it's embarrassing.
it shouldn't be. It can be a great thing when it's right.
but I don't want you to feel like you have to handle this alone.
apparently, Andi was the one who couldn't handle it.
she's cut me off.
she has? I mean, she has?
girls are confusing.
Oh, this is only the beginning.
so, do you feel like you want to tell me more about it?
Yeah. Sure.
what's next, mud wrestling?
you can't stay mad at her forever.
what, are you choosing sides?
honestly, Trager, if I'd have known about this girl code, I never would have done it.
I was just drunk and feeling sorry for myself.
I wasn't trying to hurt you.
but I did and I'm sorry.
are you into her? - No!
I... I don't know. Maybe.
but it shouldn't matter.
you made the choice to move on.
it's not fair for you to hold me back.
I owe you an apology.
do you?
the psychic was right.
you were there to save the day.In spite of everything I did to make sure you weren't.
but I don't think the psychic predicted the future.
I think I created it. - How?
everything I did put you on that boat.
if I hadn't made you angry or had been a better friend to Jessi, neither of you would have been there.
but we were.
and it's funny.
what is?
the psychic said your soul mate would be in danger.
and after all was said and done, it wasn't me who needed saving.
it was Jessi.
my mom's here. Good night.
let's go home.
settling your tab? - Yes. Thanks for all your help.
it was a terrible joke to play on your friend.
well, that's why I paid you a little extra.
I felt him, you know.
that boy, he's special.
Yes, he is.
I see great things in his future.
you took me. You took Amanda!
she won't remember a thing.
you feeling OK?
it's just this stupid headache I've had all week.
I hope I didn't embarrass myself at the after party.
you weren't at the after party.
we were there. Weren't we?
are you going to make me ask you out?
your dad technically holds the keys to my future in his hand.
but I could ask him first.
one hundred percent, absolutely not, over my dead body, no!
Sara just left?
I would never do that to you.
I know that.
I want you to come home with me.
you're gonna have to trust me.
OK.
did everything work out the way you wanted?
exactly.
after all was said and done, it wasn't me who needed saving.
it was Jessi.
OK, you got plenty of room. Watch out!
to the left.
good. Straighten it out. Yes, you got it. Keep going.
we can put a bed here, maybe get her an armoire.
are you sure you want to give up your space?
well, I don't have much choice.
no, not unless you know a family dying to adopt a teenager grown in a pod.
it's the right thing to do.
and it's gonna be OK, right?
it's gonna be OK.
this is so not OK.
right when I can finally put this room to good use, I get a roommate.
will you look at the big picture here?
Jessi, 24/7, it's in the house.
we're so screwed.
try not screwed.
what?
for one thing, Andy's out of town, and I thought she said she was never having sex with you again.
Oh, she'll change her tune. Like she's gonna resist this.
we're smart people. We can deal.
it's gonna be OK.
sorry.
this is gonna be a disaster.
the first time I met Amanda, I was drawn by the sound of her music.
it was like her soul was calling out to me and mine was answering.
I never questioned what it meant, this indefinable connection.
I just knew she was the one.
what should I do?
what?
do I help cook?
Jessi, your job is to eat.
I don't eat eggs.
um, you want a waffle? - OK.
I'll take a waffle.
just eat your eggs.
how'd you sleep, Jessi?
good, I guess. It's a cot.
at least you've got your own room.
give it up, Josh.
what's wrong?
nothing.
has anyone seen my cell?
did you check outside?
maybe you left it out there when you were talking to Mark last night.
mark? You were talking to Mark? I told you...
a different Mark, dad. - It better be.
this different Mark must be really funny.
you were giggling a lot.
so, Josh, when does Andy get back?
not soon enough. Two more days, and the wait is killing me.
is she gonna do it?
do what?
you know, reopen the store and be generous with the merchandise.
that's what you said on the phone.
you're like a human wiretap.
I guess privacy in this house is a thing of the past.
Kyle's doing it, too.
he's listening to Amanda play right now.
I'm sorry, what?
you were listening to Amanda.
except she stopped playing.
you're right, she stopped.
Amanda, you fainted.
I'm calling 911.
no, mom, please, I stood up from the piano too fast.
there's no reason for everyone to hover.
why now? Your audition is in two days.
is there anything I can get you?
I'm gonna make you something to eat.
I'm fine!
she didn't have breakfast this morning. No appetite.
something was upsetting her.
maybe it was you.
how long are you going to be staying with the Tragers?
as long as she wants to.
it's turned into a regular orphanage.
you look really pale.
so, is this how it's gonna be now, the two of you rushing over to protect me?
maybe we wouldn't have to if you were capable of taking care of yourself.
I can take care of myself. - I know that.
Jessi, thanks. You can go home now.
Yes, I'll go back to our house.
I hope you feel better.
she means well. - Does she?
honestly, Kyle, I am preparing for the most important concert of my life.
the thought of you two living together...
it's not like that.
she needs a place to live, a family.
I know... - Amanda.
you're the only one for me.
there's nothing to worry about.
now go home.
seriously, I have to practice.
if I'm not absolutely perfect I won't be able to win that scholarship, which, as my mom keeps reminding me, is the only way I'm paying for college.
want me to stay and listen?
you'll distract me. Go home.
Amanda's concentration's just off.
don't worry, she'll get it back.
I don't know. It's not like her.
it's nerves.
it happens to everybody. Trust me.
last year I couldn't hit an outside shot for three straight games.
suddenly, I'm nailing every one.
I just wish Jessi could have moved in after the concert.
Oh, right, hottie in the house.
of course your girlfriend's freaking out.
I have to keep reassuring Amanda while trying to make Jessi feel more comfortable.
sounds like a high-class problem to me, dude.
High-class? I want them both to be happy.
sorry, I've got no advice when it comes to managing women.
I think my current situation speaks for itself.
so, Is Lori seeing that Mark guy now?
stephen told her he was off limits.
like that's not gonna drive her straight to him.
Hiya. - Lori Trager. What are you slumming in college town now?
I'm just passing through.
Really?
sure. I mean, I know we're not allowed to go out with each other, but as far as I know there's no rule against accidental run-ins.
Oh, is that what this is?
a hundred percent purely accidental run-in. Scout's honor.
I don't know. Something tells me you weren't a girl scout.
not even remotely.
well, um, it is nice, accidentally running into you.
would you like to do it again here tomorrow?
see, now you're pushing it.
is that a yes?
well, it's not like you can prevent an accident.
do you want a ride? - How about another game?
they're both gonna be there, Kyle, no matter what time you get home.
I'll walk. Thanks.
later.
somebody likes you.
here.
what's wrong, not a big fan of the canine?
it's not the dog I have a problem with.
look, I want to apologize. OK?
we could have handled things a lot better. I told him.
I said, "if we want to make a good first impression then abducting you and your girlfriend, probably not the best way to go."
you're lucky no one called the police.
could have.
wouldn't have found anything. Our membership is very exclusive. Careful.
I'd like to keep things just between us.
Kyle, hang on. Can we start over?
who are you?
what do you want?
OK, to put it bluntly, you are our greatest achievement.
and we want to make sure we have a relationship with you.
a relationship to do what?
anything and everything.
come see what we are about.
we are making state of the art advances in science and technology.
right. A group of visionaries and humanitarians. Scientists.
no, mate. I don't have the smarts.
I'm more of a front man.
scientists, terrible social skills.
anyway, they sent me to convince you to give us a second chance.
let us show you we're the good guys.
I'm not interested. - I'm hoping you'll change your mind.
humor me.
here, boy.
you've been a very bad girl, amber. Haven't you?
dad!
what the hell are you doing?
I mean, I know what you're doing but what the hell are you doing?
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm going crazy.
Andy's been out of town and you know, I miss her.
I get that you miss your girlfriend but this is not OK.
when the bill for this program comes in, you're paying for it.
is there a charge?
I unscrambled the channel.
why would you do that?
Josh asked me to.
grounded for a week? - Two.
nark.
dude, you gotta do something about Jessi.
she can't keep a secret for five minutes.
she totally ratted me out to dad.
she's not used to living with a family.
remember when I first moved in here?
I told Stephen I took that test for you, but you forgave me.
give her time.
well...
she did provide me with a fairly excellent dose of porn.
you really miss Andy, don't you?
I thought I was thirsty before.
but now that I've had my first taste...
with her gone, I'm totally dehydrated.
so, Andy's a drink that doesn't quench your thirst?
no, she does. She did.
it's just... since we went there, to that place, I'm going crazy.
that's all I think about.
you had that accidental run-in with Jessi in the bathroom.
why aren't you messed up?
why would I be messed up?
you saw her boobs and they're right downstairs.
both of them.
I love Amanda.
she's my soul mate.
your soul mate? That's intense.
I felt it from the first time I saw her.
we just connected, as if we were meant to meet each other.
Amanda's always been the one for me.
you still haven't gotten it right.
coming in every second isn't helping.
great. Broke a string.
I keep messing up in the same place.
it's like I can't hold the piece in my head. That's never happened before.
you'll get it. You always do.
what if I don't? I need this scholarship.
done.
it's like I'm carrying this stress in the back of my neck.
here, let me.
feels good. - Good.
it's been one thing after another lately.
what do you mean?
first the headaches, now this pain in my neck.
forgetting my music...
you're just nervous.
I guess.
you know, now that I think about it, I just haven't felt like myself since prom.
we know that Latnok sedated her.
it must have been a very strong dose.
so strong that she's still having side effects two weeks later?
why is there pain in her neck?
stress? She's nervous about her concert.
what if it's more than that?
what if they did something to her?
Kyle, I think you're being paranoid.
they kidnapped us! It was all a sick game.
who knows what else they're capable of?
let's say you're right, they did something. Now what?
Amanda keeps getting stuck at the same place in her music.
as if her memory's misfiring.
it could be neurological.
well, it's not like you can just scan her brain to find out.
OK. You could figure out a way.
this never would have happened if it weren't for me.
I have to make sure she's all right.
anything for your precious Amanda.
fancy meeting you here.
what a wonderful coincidence.
for me?
I just like to keep them on hand in case of accidental run-ins.
that's so nice of you.
why do you sound so surprised?
no, it's just, people don't buy me flowers very often.
well, then you've been dating the wrong people.
I mean accidentally running into the wrong people.
we're really doing this, aren't we?
I'm willing to take the risk.
I mean, that's assuming that you want to.
I took three buses just to get here. Of course I do.
it's just never been this easy before.
no games, it's so direct. Just... honesty.
Yeah, well... it's not easy.
I mean, we're being bad. Secretive.
downright duplicitous.
we are so evil.
would you care to be evil over pizza?
I would love to.
best accidental run-in ever.
is that what happened to my Xbox?
I needed to wire this controller.
what do I get out of this deal?
knowing that you helped Amanda.
that's no reward for me, either.
do you see her? I need to install this scanner under the piano.
I don't want her to see us.
Oh, yes, you know, that would be terrible.
Jessi, you wanted to help.
I'm here, aren't I?
yo, Amanda's next. Better fire up that scanner thingy.
find a place backstage for the receiver.
what should I do?
make sure we don't get caught. - Right.
excuse me. Are you a performer? - No.
performers only in the stage area.
but I'm just... - Who are you?
I'm sorry, but you're not allowed to be here. Please leave.
Oh, my god! This is the wrong piece!
this is Tchaikovsky and I wanted Spandus Strapopovich.
mother! Where are you? How could you do this to me? I hate you!
young man...
are you in charge here? - I am.
this is completely unacceptable.
you need to come with me.
Kyle? What are you doing here?
wishing you luck.
it's a closed rehearsal. And I need to focus.
OK. Well, then, good luck.
the device is working perfectly.
great.
we make a good team.
thanks for helping.
leave me alone.
Amanda, I just want to help.
by showing up with your housemate?
you know how that makes me feel, especially now.
I shouldn't have brought her.
no, you shouldn't have.
but somehow, she's always around, helping.
let me ask you something.
what?
that night, after prom, when you went looking for me...
yes?
was Jessi there?
why would you think... - Just answer the question.
Jessi helped me find you, yes.
I knew it.
look, I know that night must seem very strange.
strange?
it's this big giant question Mark, and now that I know she was there it makes it all even worse.
wherever you go, she goes.
I know it may seem that way... - No, that's how it is!
and honestly, Kyle, I can't take it!
I've got to nail this audition and I can't be worrying about what is and what is not going on with the two of you all the time.
I just can't! - There's nothing going on.
then maybe you could try not spending every second with her!
see how that goes.
Oh, cool. You got it to read the data from the rehearsal.
this is all of Amanda's brain activity.
were you up all night? - Not all night.
maybe most of it.
you know, you could have used your computer.
it wouldn't have bothered me.
this one's fine.
well, call out the numbers. I'll input them in the program.
I should do this by myself.
Why?
just, maybe you should go see what everybody else is up to.
it's Amanda, right?
she hates me.
she doesn't hate you.
she just thinks that we spend too much time together.
I've only been trying to help.
I know.
but she doesn't know the real story, so it looks different to her.
it must be hard, being with someone when you have to keep so many secrets.
it is. I wish I could tell her everything.
then why don't you?
I think about how worried she'd be.
who knows how much more danger I'd be putting her in.
I feel like she'd be more protected if she didn't know the whole truth.
I know the whole truth.
thankfully, you can take care of yourself.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh, my God. There's something there.
you were right.
they put something in her brain.
what did you do to Amanda? - What?
you put something in her head.
Kyle, you're being really...
tell me what it is.
OK. It's something new we've developed. It's safe.
instead of typical sedative you use an nanoscopic neuro-blocker.
attaches itself to the receptors on the brain stem.
why would you do that?
so she wouldn't remember anything from that night.
it should have dissolved.
well, it hasn't.
she's having side effects and I need to get it out.
we can't get it out.
but we might be able to disintegrate it.
we? You mean Latnok?
I'd like to help.
Kyle, don't try anything on your own. You could hurt her.
let me make a phone call.
you've done enough.
Hilary, where are you when I need you?
where are you off to?
Amanda's concert?
Oh, crap. You can totally tell when I'm lying, huh?
just like Kyle.
you're going to meet Mark.
listen...
let me break it down for you.
when it comes to living in this house,
I know we all gather round the kitchen island and yuk it up and we're all smiles and hugs and touching moments, but underneath, it is us versus them.
everyone under legal voting age is honor-bound to keep each other's secrets.
well, I can keep a secret.
great.
that's it?
as long as you don't rat me out to mom and dad, you're in.
I won't.
fine. Good.
you know, you should wear your hair down.
long healthy hair helps signal a prospective male to your reproductive potential.
OK, thanks. That's good to know.
how's it going, man?
good, man. Really good.
I'm close to a breakthrough on the three dimensional algorithm.
glad to hear it. Look.
I heard through the grapevine you've been spending time with Lori Trager.
uh, I guess. She's a great girl.
no doubt.
but, um, you know how we like to keep things confidential.
our goal is to get our guy back in the fold.
you were never supposed to make contact with his sister.
I know. We met by accident. It was just a...
I'll keep things separate. I mean, we're just hanging out.
not anymore.
Jessi, hey!
your pants are down.
Oh, look at that.
what are you doing?
I, uh, was just thinking of, uh...
Hey, she's pretty. - Don't look at that!
are you ok?
knee... broken.
leave. Out!
good. I need your help figuring this out.
I thought you couldn't be seen with me.
I don't have time for that.
what we saw is a neuro-block which hasn't been dissolved.
it's keeping Amanda's memory of what to play from getting to her fingers.
but I think I can eliminate it with an electrical charge.
OK.
how do I do it without electrocuting her?
that's a risk I'd be willing to take.
I know. You don't have time for this.
that's Amanda's head? - Right.
it's empty.
you don't have to be here.
except this is my room now.
I have to regulate the voltage and apply the right amount to disintegrate the block.
but without hurting her.
that's not enough. - I know.
you need more power if you want it to work. - I know.
let me concentrate.
that's it. You're doing it.
more. More.
more. More.
I think I need to touch Amanda to control the electrical flow more precisely.
she'll feel it and know what you're doing.
not if I can distract her.
while you're zapping her?
does someone want to explain why my laptop just fried like my brain on drugs?
I must have caused a power surge.
sorry. I'll fix it later.
later not so good for me.
I was in the middle of something important.
Charlotte cam live.
see, it's you. You are the problem.
eavesdropping, barging in without knocking, blowing out electricity.
that was me. - Fine. Then you get the assist.
I can't take it anymore. I can't get a minute alone.
why don't you go somewhere else, then?
because this is my house! Not yours!
does he think I don't know that?
when I first moved in, nobody wanted me here except for nicole.
but I had nowhere else to go.
they'll come around. It'll just take time.
how much time before Josh isn't mad at me?
probably until Andy comes back tonight.
a welcome home kiss from her, he'll forget why he's upset.
Kyle, that's it!
what?
how you can help Amanda without her knowing what you're doing.
pass the electricity through a kiss.
I won't know how much power to give her. If I'm wrong I'll electrocute her.
then you'll have to practice.
on what?
me.
are you all charged up?
ready? - OK.
either of you seen Lori? - No.
she's been out all day.
did she say anything to you?
nothing at all.
what was that?
what was what?
you just gave her a look.
that was your "I know you're lying" look.
I don't have that look.
did Lori ask you to lie?
I knew it. She's with Mark.
there you are. I thought you ran off with a girl your own age.
Yeah. Uh, I'm sorry. I got held up.
lucky for you I'm not high maintenance.
do you want me to come to you?
listen, Lori, um, I don't even know how to say this.
is this the part where it's not easy anymore?
look, my future's really important to me and I don't want to jeopardize it.
I got it.
now, Lori, come on. This isn't about you.
mark, I said I got it.
and now I'm going to hang up.
look, I'm sorry. - Goodbye.
this is weird.
it's science.
I know, but I've never kissed you before.
you've seen me naked.
you're not helping.
sorry.
I shouldn't be kissing anyone other than Amanda.
fine. Go kiss Amanda.
give her your best guess about the voltage.
maybe you'll be right and you won't kill her.
sorry.
you need more practice.
Amanda, hi.
I think Kyle's in his room.
actually, I wanted to see you.
but if you're on your way out the door...
no, that's OK. Please.
I was hoping you could teach me some relaxation techniques.
you nervous about the concert tonight?
the entire scholarship committee from u-dub is gonna be there.
watching and judging.
I haven't been able to get through the piece in weeks and my mom's all over me.
well, sometimes parents don't realize the pressure they're adding.
it's not just her. I'm off my game.
it's not the easiest thing in the world to have Kyle and Jessi living under the same roof.
I can see how that would bother you, but you can trust Kyle.
I know.
I guess I don't trust her.
is that awful?
Amanda, you and Kyle have a very special connection.
he would never do anything to hurt you, OK?
trust that.
I don't want to hurt you again.
I can take it.
maybe if I touched you.
use my hands to complete a circuit, any extra current will flow back through me.
it's worth a shot.
do you have enough charge left to try again?
I think so.
how's that?
that's not bad.
I feel warm.
it tingles a little.
are you ready?
just try to be gentle.
I can hear your heart beating.
yours, too.
Amanda, wait. Let me explain.
you are always trying to explain!
explaining why you keep secrets, explaining why you didn't tell me what happened on prom night.
but there is no explanation for why you were kissing Jessi!
there is. I'll tell you everything.
I don't even care anymore, because none of it matters.
it does matter.
it'll help you understand why all of this is happening.
Kyle, the only person who doesn't understand what is happening is you.
please.
I'm late for my recital.
I've ruined it.
I've ruined us.
I'm so sorry, Kyle.
she's gonna get to that section of the music and she won't be able to play it.
I can't let that happen.
I have to help her.
is there any other way than kissing her?
no.
then I guess you have to go make it right.
Thanks, Jessi.
comfortable?
I need to clear my head.
the tub always works for Kyle.
I thought you'd be with Andy. Isn't tonight the big homecoming?
her mom's extended their vacation rental for another three weeks.
Oh, sweetie. I'm sorry.
I know you're frustrated.
I just want to see her.
I thought it was for other reasons, but today I got all mad at Kyle and Jessi and all I could think of was telling Andy about it.
I just really miss her.
Yeah.
the Jessi thing, you know it's not gonna be easy, right?
I know we all got used to Kyle and that turned out great.
I just hope we can get used to her.
so do I.
is everything OK? - Fine.
you've been gone a while. Do anything exciting?
not really, no.
how about I phrase it this way: See anyone exciting?
actually, no, dad, I didn'T. And thank you, Jessi.
I knew you couldn't keep your mouth shut.
Jessi didn't have to say a word.
I'm sure she was a real pillar of secrecy.
I'll just go.
this isn't her fault.
Oh, that's good. Stick up for her.
let's see how else you can destroy my day.
I didn't destroy your day.
no? Because it was going pretty well until Mark told me he won't date me because he's afraid of his future.
good. He should be.
why do you get to decide who I can and can't go out with?
because I'm your father and you live in my house!
real original, dad.
does it feel good to be a walking parental clich?
you want a clich? Go to your room!
you are not allowed back here.
I need to see her. - I don't know what you did to her, but my daughter is back there crying her eyes out.
I've never seen her like this.
I can help her. Please.
don't you think you've done enough?
keep him out.
two minutes.
what are you doing here?
I couldn't let you perform without trying to make things better.
it's just... I feel so sad.
I did this to you.
Amanda, I'm so sorry.
I trusted you.
and I broke that trust.
I hurt you.
I never thought I'd do anything to hurt you, but I did.
I love you so much, Amanda.
I love you too, that's why it hurts so badly.
it's not that you kissed her.
it's that I can feel what's happening between you two.
there's nothing. - You don't see it. But it's there.
I can't be with you when I know I'm losing you to someone else.
you'll never lose me.
I already have.
I'm sorry. One minute.
I can't do this.
I can't go out and play.
let me help you.
I know how to fix your problem.
how?
if you have any trust left for me at all, let me show you.
you're on.
Amanda's music had brought us together.
we had connected that first time I heard her play.
and now, somehow our connection had been severed.
though she had never played better, it broke my heart to know that because of what I had done, she would be playing on without me.
I can't be with you when I know I'm losing you to someone else.
you could never lose me. - I already have.
I'm Cassidy.
there is a foreign hottie who seems into you.
you're available. - I guess.
guess? Is there a romantic interest I'm not aware of?
only Kyle. - Kyle?
I'm sorry, I really am, but it, the sex, is done.
why would you invite Lori Trager here if you were meeting me?
I see the problem.
you told me not to see her.
I thought you'd be happy.
watch out!
we've done all we can.
Adam's substitute for amniotic fluid.
think it could help Nicole?
there is one place you might be able to get some.
my mother is dying. - I have what you need.
I can get it to you. - Thank you.
but you have to do something for me. Join us.
at Latnok. It's your choice.
I pushed Kyle to go to Latnok today because I knew it could save Nicole's life.
now, if you ever harm him or anyone else in that family, I'll kill you.
she's gonna be ok.
thank you.
how's Mrs. Trager?
she's ok.
getting her strength back slowly.
we're taking good care of her.
that's great.
I was gonna come by. I mean, I should have.
but I was really busy at work.
that's ok.
you don't have to avoid the rack, you know.
Oh, I'm not avoiding it. - Because even though we're not...
it doesn't mean you have to give up smoothies.
I'd still make you one if you wanted me to.
Amanda, I still like smoothies.
you do? - Of course.
I've just been busy.
right. Sure.
how about lasagna?
a lasagna smoothie?
I could make one and bring it by.
want to make lasagna for me? For the family.
your mom probably doesn't feel like cooking nowadays.
that'd be great.
well, I gotta... - Me too.
lasagna!
what did she want?
were you listening?
no. I was watching.
she just wanted to say hello.
what's the point in dumping you if she still wants to talk?
she was being polite.
she broke up with youand hurt your feelings. That's not very polite.
I'm getting over it.
I'm trying.
today should help take your mind off it.
I don't want the family to know I'm going to Latnok.
I don't want to upset Nicole.
then don't go. - I've made a deal.
and I've seen what they're capable of. If I don't go today, it won't be the end of it.
so you won't say anything?
I won't.
I'm glad I can count on you.
why are we at a university?
what did you expect, to go to my underground lair?
it wouldn't surprise me.
well, maybe this will.
I know your previous impressions of Latnok have been not so great, but I'm determined to change all that.
I want you to see that we're not about stuffy suits or mad scientists.
what are you about?
the future.
these are the best and brightest minds on campus, but none of them hold a candle to you.
what do they know about me?
I told them you're a genius.
a prodigy. A real find.
but that's all they know.
as far as they're concerned, you're just my latest recruit.
the one I wanted most of all.
that sounds pretty.
Thanks. I'm writing a song or my mom.
don't you want her to feel better?
Yeah, that's why I'm...
don't you have anything else you could be doing, like magically lighting small animals on fire?
why would I do that? - It's a joke.
never mind.
I need a favor.
and you've teed it up so successfully.
please don't tell Kyle anything about Cassidy.
finally you've opened your eyes up to the hotness next door.
so you won't tell him? - Why do you care if Kyle knows you've been seeing Cassidy?
I just don't think he'd like it.
whatever.
but my silence comes with a price.
the keys to your apartment.
mark and I need privacy.
but it's mine. - Yet you want me to keep your secret.
what a predicament.
I thought you were done being mean to me. - This isn't mean.
this is sibling politics.
kill or be killed. Ask Josh.
so do we have a deal or what?
we have a deal.
you look great.
how do you feel?
well, I can finally go up and down the stairs without feeling like a ginsu knife is piercing me in the lungs, so pretty good.
Oh, scratch that.
what's that? Hospital bill.
how much? Wow.
too many pages...
Oh, my god. Uh, is that before insurance?
I wish.
Stephen, we don't have this kind of money. What are we gonna do?
what are we gonna do about what?
Uh...dinner.
you know what? I...I don't feel like cooking.
is she ok?
Yeah. She'll be fine. Don't worry about it.
is this sponsored by the university?
the university gives us the space in exchange for bragging rights generated by our ideas.
what kind of ideas?
advances in science, technology.
working towards a better, more sophisticated civilization.
I don't have a great history with people who say that.
Yeah, well, forget about everybody else.
we're the real deal.
and this lovely little pixie is Jackie.
who holds the record for darts, guitar hero and the longest keg stand.
let me know if I can kick your ass at any of them later, cutie.
what's she working on?
nuclear suitcase bomb.
plants, mate. Growth patterns.
my goal is to accelerate the maturation period.
a system like hers could help eradicate world hunger.
have you considered binding ft proteins to activate the nucleus of the meristem cells?
no. No, I haven't.
so, the great mind has finally come to play with us mortals.
Yeah, most people open with "hello," but that will work.
Nathanial Harrison, Kyle Trager.
hello. - Hello.
and goodbye. I've got work to do.
why don't you tell Kyle here what you're working on? Maybe he can help.
uh, no offense, boy genius, but I graduated high school at 13, and I have an IQ of 156.
I think I got it.
Nate considers himself top dog around here.
he thinks I'm an idiot because I have the IQ of a normal person.
I don't take it personally. I've got better hair.
so, make yourself at home. Get to know everyone.
I believe you already know... - Mark?
I'm glad we finally got you in here.
easy there.
you're hitting a little too close to the promised land.
I love the never-ending role reversal.
the who? - With us.
first it was you who didn't want to, you know.
then it was me. And now it's you.
wait a minute.
were those littlet winkly finger maneuvers your way of telling me that you've changed your mind?
I don't know. Would that be such a bad thing?
are you testing me? Is this a test?
Josh, I'm not testing you.
I just missed you.
I missed you, too. Really bad.
Josh, I need a...
to have an exorcism! Don't you knock?
don't you lock? - It's ok. You can look.
Oh! I'm so, so, so sorry.
but I need to talk to you. - Now?
my cue to leave.
Bye.
did you get a How to Screw Your Brother over handbook the day I was born?
no, but you were lucky it was me and not mom!
which is what I wanted to talk to you about.
is there something wrong?
Yeah. I caught a glimpse of the hospital bill.
they can't pay it.
how do you know that?
they walked me through the finances when they made their will.
they have a will?
Yes, idiot, and now we have a problem.
so, where's our chief problem solver?
I've been involved for two years.
I know I didn't tell you or Lori.
I swear to you, I met her totally by accident.
Lori needs to know.
OK. You're right. I'll tell her.
I know this is a bit overwhelming for you, your first day and all, but we're good people here. And we have the best resources available.
it's all about discovery and opportunity.
scientific and financial.
financial?
Yeah, we're encouraged to chase grants and enter competitions.
for myself, I cleared more than 80, 000 last year.
so, have we won you over yet?
see you later.
I'm here to pay a debt, keep my word.
beyond that, I have no interest in being part of this.
if you can't let go of pastime pressions, your time here is not going to be productive.
so go home.
seriously, go home.
sleep on it. If you're not back tomorrow morning, then so be it.
debt paid.
deal?
deal.
there has to be something we can do.
we were hoping you could help us figure that out.
Where's Jessi?
out.
this was the one place we could privately summit without mom and dad stumbling in.
so, what's our strategy?
I make minimum wage, and this slacker over here doesn't work at all.
I could take my guitar and play on a street corner.
you'd do better without the guitar.
Hey, enough kidding around.
we're talking thousands of dollars here.
we're never gonna come up with that kind of cash.
I have an idea.
I had been released from my debt to Cassidy, but now a new debt had arrived.
what was the price I'd have to pay for the situation I had created?
and, in the end, would it be worth it?
I had no way of knowing.
but I also knew I had no choice.
Hello, this is Cassidy. Please leave a message.
Cassidy, it's Kyle.
I'll be back tomorrow.
good morning.
I need to know about all available competitions with a cash prize.
suddenly the entrepreneur, eh?
um, no problem. Mark can help you with that.
Hey. A hover board competition.
um, the deadline's... - thirty-six hours and 23 minutes.
judged here on campus. It's exactly what I need.
no, I think what you need is a breath.
I know how smart you are, but even if you manage to construct the prototype, highly unlikely, the real question is whether it will work.
Nate's been jamming on this for a year.
he's working the bugs out. - I have to try.
I really... - if you could show me where I could work.
Yeah, um, we'll set you up a station here.
so, head over heels or a broken heart?
most songs are about one or the other.
how do you know I'm writing a song?
I know you pretty well.
Yeah. Yes, you do.
I'm hoping if I write enough songs, I can sell them.
so which one is it?
she's gonna make me say it.
how's that guy, Mark?
that guy, Mark, is... good.
good. - And you are...?
good. - Good.
I guess I'll see you around.
sounds like a whole lot of goodness going on around here.
I'm hoping we can move past the awkward stage.
one minute you're telling each other everything, and the next you don't know what to say.
exactly.
just because you break up with a guy doesn't mean you stop having feelings for him.
I know. I don't want to, but sometimes I still do. I just...
I can't get past the whole Jessi thing.
Kyle does not have feelings for Jessi.
trust me, I would kill him.
she's totally after him. Jessi's the kind of girl who gets what she wants.
Jessi likes someone else now.
she does?
she's over Kyle. So, maybe, you don't have to be.
Jessi's got a sweet secret pad.
what's all this?
everything I can afford to part with and not walk around naked.
why is it here?
cause if I'm gonna sell everything I own online, I don't want my parents to know about.
that's where you come in. - Not remotely following.
you'll be my boxer/shipper.
I thought you brought me here for more exciting purposes.
that can be the reward for a job well done.
how did you get the keys to this place, anyway?
Lori blackmailed them out of Jessi, I blackmailed 'em out of Lori.
what do you have on Lori?
nothing. I just inferred things.
she's a guilty person.
you're cute when you're being diabolical.
I just really want to help my mom. I know you do.
and I'm happy to help.
but maybe we can get to the reward part first?
someone's in a rush to get to the good stuff.
here we are, alone in our secret little apartment.
no fears of getting caught.
do you have any idea how many couples would kill for a deal like this?
or how much they'd pay for it.
you're a genius!
Oh. Apparently, now I'm also a pimp.
you really think you can build a working prototype in less than two days?
seems that maybe you're not as smart as they think you are.
maybe so.
this isn't like playing with Legos.
there's no way you can finish.
your board is burning.
what was that for?
my tomato plants doubled their growth in 12 hours.
that's amazing.
thanks to you.
you're so nice. Well, why wouldn't I be?
how are you feeling?
much better. - Good, because I have some news.
I made a decision. I've been thinking about it.
I'm not gonna go to college.
what?
it doesn't make sense for me to spend four years when all I care about is my music.
Lori! - Plus, it's so expensive.
Lori, you know I love you and I try to respect your life choices, but this is a non-starter for me.
but... - please don't make me play the mom who just got out of the hospital and has a weak heart card.
OK. You need time to process.
there's not enough time in the world for this one.
let me get that. - I've got it.
mom! - Lori, I've got it.
all right. Suit yourself.
let me get it. I've got... I've got it.
you're not supposed to get it. Well, why not?
because we're supposed to treat you delicately until you feel better.
who told you that? - Lori.
since when do you listen to Lori.
I guess you're right.
OK, so, uh, where are you coming from?
I was out.
just wandering the streets aimlessly?
why would I do that?
no, I meant you could tell me more if you want to.
no, I can't.
why not?
because I'm not supposed to upset you.
Lori again? Kyle.
Kyle? What does he think would upset me?
I really shouldn't be talking to you about this.
I... I think you should.
I think I did something really bad.
and I don't want Kyle to know, but I'm worried that what I did might affect what he's doing.
and then he won't realize what's being done. - What happened?
Jessi, tell me.
I can't believe you're working with them.
it was the only way to get you help when you were so sick.
I had to make the deal.
now you need to unmake it.
Nicole. - I'm serious, Kyle.
I don't want you involved with those people.
it's not as bad as you think. Not as bad?
they followed you, they toyed with you, they kidnapped Amanda!
so far there's been nothing. - No, don't do that.
don't tell me anything other than that your relationship with them is over.
it can't be over. I'm sorry.
how could you tell her? - I was worried.
I don't like that you're involved with them.
I don't like that I'm involved with them!
but I have to be. - Why?
why can't you just walk away?
I had the chance, but Stephen and Nicole ran into money trouble, so now I can't.
money trouble? - Yes.
the hospital bill is really high.
Oh. I didn't know that.
I have to help them, no matter what it takes.
why are you always helping people, even if it's hurting you?
because that's what you do, Jessi.
that's what people do. - But Cassidy's a bad person. I don't trust him.
what do you know about Cassidy?
Jessi, what do you know about Cassidy?
I met him a while ago.
he didn't tell me he was part of Latnok, at first.
what did he tell you? I thought he was my neighbor.
he lived down the hall from Sarah's apartment, probably as a way of keeping tabs on me.
he told me that Latnok is changing and that you and I can help with that change.
and you believed him? - I didn't know what to believe.
Sarah hated them, but then she left.
he was there, being so kind and supportive and telling me how important we both were to the future.
when Nicole got injured and she needed help...
you suggested I go see him. - You would have gone anyway.
but you encouraged me without telling me the whole story!
you did exactly what Cassidy wanted!
I'm sorry.
I'm working with the people I trust least in this world.
I never thought you'd be just like them.
Hello?
an appointment for what?
what apartment? Hello?
that was one of Josh's friends, canceling a 10: 30 appointment.
what appointment?
he hung up. Said something about an apartment.
Lori, what do you know about this?
nothing. Not a thing.
zero.
you want to try that again?
Four-ninety-eight, 499, 500. Not bad.
except for the fact I've had to clean this place five times in the past 24 hours.
we could hire a maid.
that'd cut into our profits.
the last party left the bathroom looking like a chunk-style soup factory exploded.
I've still got to scrub the toilet before the 10: 30.
maybe they're not coming. - Well, they'd better come!
one appointment is 50 dollars less stress my mom has to worry about.
Amen.
I'll get the door, you manage the facilities.
don't think you guys'll get out of paying full price.
what, exactly, are we paying full price for?
dad! Mom!
great to see you!
ANDI. - Leaving. Now.
I'm late for my family summit, which hopefully goes better than this is about to.
what is going on here?
a little entrepreneurial venture.
are you in some kind of trouble?
you mean before right now?
why would you need money?
Andi's birthday.
she's expecting diamonds. Well, then start mining.
you're gonna give all this money back, and you're gonna clear out of here immediately.
I just wanted to... - Just want to what, Josh?
tell us, please, because we really want to understand.
nothing. I'm sorry. I suck.
am I on too many painkillers, or is there something seriously wrong with our children?
don't you ever sleep?
this has to be done.
you know, I know you're only into it for the prize money now, but, Kyle, I really think you're gonna like it here.
Why?
well...I know, for me, it is the first time I can remember, I'm in a place where I'm not this super-smart outsider. We all are.
it's my home.
I guess I have a different definition of home.
uh, speaking of, I haven't talked to Lori yet.
do you have any tips on how to keep her from hating me?
you're asking the wrong person about keeping secrets from his girlfriend.
Doogie howser's got a girlfriend?
not anymore.
is she hot? Amanda's a nice girl, Nate.
in other words, totally off-limits to you.
that's a pretty name.
leave her out of this.
what's this?
you're not satisfied with moving into my project?
you've got to steal my materials now, too?
I didn't steal them.
Cassidy told him he could use our supplies.
was I talking to you?
look, you can't just waltz in here and take over.
I don't want to take over anything.
who are you, anyway?
Where'd you come from and where'd you learn to make that?
I'm self-taught. - That's impossible.
is this kindergarten? We share. We help each other.
well, I'm not helping him.
Kyle isn't here.
I'm not here to see Kyle.
I made a lasagna. To help out.
OK. I'll take it.
I told you, Kyle isn't here.
and I said I'm not here to see him.
is that why your eyes are darting all over for him?
why do you even care? You already havea new boyfriend.
I don't have a boyfriend.
that's what Lori said.
here. Just take the stupid lasagna.
I heard about the Nate thing.
sorry about that. Ignore him.
should I ignore that you were conspiring with Jessi to get me in here?
she told you about that, huh?
good. Good?
we've liked the idea of her here for a while, but so far she hasn't proved to be a very trustworthy girl.
I'm glad to hear that she's honest with you.
maybe there is room for both of you here.
I don't want Jessi to have any part of this.
not after everything you've done to her. And to me.
Kyle, you have to understand, they wanted you here desperately.
who? - The old guard, stuffy suits.
they put enormous pressure on me to bring you in.
they wanted their greatest achievement.
you still haven't even told me for what.
do you not see?
that's for you to determine.
inspire them. Be inspired.
shape the future. With you on board there are no limits.
but I'm not on board.
I'm only here to help my family.
what can I do to convince you? How can we earn your trust?
you can't.
what happened?
Nate. Bye-bye.
jerk.
you don't even know what you just did.
I probably don't care, either.
Nate, for god's sake, man, shut it.
Kyle, we can fix this. I don't want you to fix it.
you all talk about being family, taking care of your own.
well, I'm going to take care of mine.
Kyle, wait.
don't.
aren't those dad's old speakers?
Yes.
I need the magnets to make the board levitate.
he's gonna kill you, you know.
I tried yours first, but they weren't big enough.
that's...
you what?
Oh, bro!
we've got to talk about the concept of personal property.
I thought Latnok had unlimited resources.
I had a setback with them. - The competition's tomorrow.
and you clearly don't have the right materials. - I know that.
why don't you just levitate with the board?
cause that would be cheating.
one day we'll discuss this sporadic morals thing you've got going.
I'll have the test scores in by tomorrow.
Yeah, thanks, you too.
so do I want to know why half the kitchen appliances are on the driveway?
science project. - For what?
for fun. You know Kyle.
loves to have fun with science. Good times.
Oh, hi. - Hi, mom.
child number one is acting deceptively vague again.
what is up with them?
Oh, child number four makes an appearance.
Sarah's been sending me these for expenses.
Jessi, this is a lot of money.
we need to open up a bank account for you.
actually, I wanted to give it to you guys.
Oh, no, this is for you.
this is her way of taking care of you.
but she doesn't. You do. I should pay rent.
you're living here as part of our family.
none of the other kids pay rent, so why should you?
Why's everybody so concerned about money lately?
Oh, no. - What?
the bill. You all know about the bill.
OK, what's going on?
I know you know about the hospital bill.
I'm trying to win a science competition so I can pay your hospital bill.
that's why I went to Latnok. If I win it I can make the money you owe.
how am I supposed to feel, knowing this is the price you're paying for saving my life?
I am the adult here.
it is my job. It is my responsibility to take care of all of you.
but it's my fault.
I was driving, and I wasn't paying attention.
I was thinking about Adam's death, and what Foss said that night, and I made the wrong turn.
I wasn't focused, and that's when we ran off the road.
Oh, Kyle. Is that what you think? That you're responsible for this?
Yes. Because it's true.
so I'm finishing this project,
I'm winning this competition tomorrow, and I'm fixing this problem that I caused.
and I'm sorry if you're not ok with it, but I won't let you stop me.
I won't stop you.
I just don't think it had to be this way.
so I hear you're solving the world's problems.
I know Nicole's upset, but I'm doing this.
actually, I was just wondering if there's anything I can do to help.
where do you need me?
OK. Here we go.
whoa. Dude, you're floating.
steady, steady.
how's it look?
uh, good.
magnets are running a little hot, but they're ok.
we need to prime the fields.
Kyle, you're flying. - Ok, let me go.
you sure?
looking good, Tragers.
steady, steady.
I can't compensate!
Stephen, shut it down.
are you ok?
I'm fine.
the board isn't.
we can fix it. - Is there time?
it's not about time. It's the magnets.
they're not pure enough.
I was hoping we could mimic their chemical makeup, but we couldn't.
industrial magnets cost thousands of dollars. They're not easy to come by.
I know where we could get some.
no. You're not asking them for anything. I don't care what the consequences are.
but we... - Kyle, please.
then it's over.
we're done.
Jessi, I don't really feel like talking.
I don't need to talk.
I just want you to have this.
did you get this from Cassidy?
no. I cashed the checks that Sarah sent me.
then I tracked down an online supplier who sold me the magnets for half the market value.
do you think it will work?
I don't know.
but at least now we have a chance.
thank you.
you're welcome.
no, we've got it. We've got pens for everyone.
I'll start final assembly.
and now our fourth and fifth contestants, Robert Gibson and Linda Tifford.
well, you good? - Yeah.
praying won't help you now, newbie.
look, I don't quite know how it went down, but we can assume that whatever happened, Nate was out of line.
we've all been there.
so where do you need us?
look, he's all confused.
we're here to help you.
I'd like that.
cool.
this is the main frame. I'm gonna need those, too.
now, taking the stage, our final two contestants, Kyle Trager and Nate Harrison.
the current leader had an elevation level of five feet, six and one half inches, 22. 4 second duration.
followed closely by five feet, three inches and 19 seconds.
Hey.
you're just the girl I need to talk to.
what are you doing here?
uh... it's a long story that ends with me telling you that I've liked you since the minute we met.
which doesn't excuse the fact that I didn't tell you this before now. I know.
tell me what?
the Latnok organization? The one Kyle's working with?
I'm a part of it.
you're what?
Yeah. - No.
don't. I can't deal with this right now.
we'll talk about it later.
you know, when you paint a loser gold, you still know what's inside.
I'm just saying.
all right. Begin.
I hope that thing doesn't explode.
"experimental" and "prototype" are just synonyms for "kaboom."
cream always rises to the top.
we have a 50, 000 dollar grand prize winner.
round one goes to you.
Yeah!
there doesn't have to be a round two.
don't be so sure about that.
that was amazing. Great job.
Kyle, that was so awesome.
congratulations, Kyle.
everything has a price.
I had paid mine, certain of the outcome. And yet, here I was, wondering if, possibly, I had been wrong.
why are you in such a good mood?
cleaning up other people's trash is punishment.
two reasons.
one, Kyle saved the day and we're not on the verge of bankruptcy anymore.
I thought we'd have to sell the house and move, which would've sucked.
and two, after we're done cleaning, we have the apartment all to ourselves.
a swing and a miss.
Josh, we need to talk.
Oh, no. Role reversal again?
I wish.
I have some really bad news.
Hey, what's the matter?
you're not sick again, are you?
please tell me you're not 'cause I know you rely on me to be strong, and I don't know if I can handle that.
it's not the cancer.
it's worse.
what could be worse than that?
Cleveland. - Excuse me?
同步: YTET-Vicky8800-=www. ydy. com/bbs=
my mom got a job she couldn't pass up.
we move at the end of the month.
you can't move.
what about us?
no...
we're closed.
I'm the kind of guy who can't take no for an answer.
except I'm tired and I really want to go home.
you don't look tired.
but I'll get out of your hair.
slink sadly home to ponder the sad state of life without a caffeine buzz.
the pity strategy. Nice.
this is for telling me I don't look tired.
you're saving my life.
I'm Nate.
that's a pretty name.
come in.
did you win?
are you still mad?
I don't want to be.
help me understand.
you knew better, yet you did it anyway.
I never wanted to hurt you.
you're the most important person to me in the world.
I just...
I wanted to be accepted by them, and I let him manipulate me.
why would you want to be involved with them at all?
because it...
would have been something that you and I shared.
Jessi, we share a lot of things.
not enough.
I wanted more.
I need to trust that you'll always be honest with me.
otherwise, we won't share anything.
in that case...
I guess you should know Amanda came by.
she did?
when? The other day.
why didn't you tell me?
cause I think that she still likes you.
what does that have to...?
wait, she does?
what does that have to do with you not telling me?
what is it?
why didn't you tell me about Amanda?
because I don't want you to be with her.
I want you to be with me.
I can't be with you when I know I'm losing you to someone else.
you could never lose me. -- I already have.
I'm Cassidy. -- There is a foreign hottie who seems into you.
you're available. -- I guess.
guess? Is there a romantic interest I'm not aware of?
only Kyle. -- Kyle?
I'm sorry, I really am, but it, the sex, is done.
why would you invite Lori Trager here if you were meeting me?
I see the problem. -- You told me not to see her.
I thought you'd be happy.
watch out!
we've done all we can.
Adam's substitute for amniotic fluid.
think it could help Nicole? There is one place you might be able to get some.
my mother is dying. -- I have what you need.
I can get it to you. -- Thank you.
but you have to do something for me. Join us.
at Latnok. It's your choice.
I pushed Kyle to go to Latnok today because I knew it could save Nicole's life.
now, if you ever harm him or anyone else in that family -- I'll kill you. -- She's gonna be OK.
thank you.
how's Mrs. Trager? -- She's OK.
getting her strength back slowly.
we're taking good care of her.
that's great.
I was gonna come by. I mean, I should have.
but I was really busy at work.
that's OK.
you don't have to avoid The Rack, you know.
Oh, I'm not avoiding it. -- Even though we're not...
it doesn't mean you have to give up smoothies.
I'd still make you one if you wanted me to.
Amanda, I still like smoothies.
you do? -- Of course.
I've just been busy. -- Right.
sure.
how about lasagna? -- A lasagna smoothie?
I could make one and bring it by.
want to make lasagna for me? -- For the family.
your mom probably doesn't feel like cooking nowadays.
that'd be great.
well, I gotta... -- Me too.
lasagna!
what did she want? -- Were you listening?
no. I was watching.
she just wanted to say hello.
what's the point in dumping you if she still wants to talk?
she was being polite. -- She broke up with you and hurt your feelings.
that's not very polite. -- I'm getting over it.
I'm trying. -- Today should help take your mind off it.
I don't want the family to know I'm going to Latnok.
I don't want to upset Nicole.
then don't go. -- I've made a deal.
and I've seen what they're capable of. If I don't go today, it won't be the end of it.
so you won't say anything? -- I won't.
I'm glad I can count on you.
I've waited a long time for this day. -- Why are we at a university?
what did you expect, to go to my underground lair?
it wouldn't surprise me.
well, maybe this will.
I know your previous impressions of Latnok have been not so great, but I'm determined to change all that.
I want you to see that we're not about stuffy suits or mad scientists.
what are you about?
the future.
these are the best and brightest minds on campus, but none of them hold a candle to you.
what do they know about me? -- I told them you're a genius.
a prodigy. A real find.
but that's all they know.
as far as they're concerned, you're just my latest recruit.
the one I wanted most of all.
that sounds pretty. -- Thanks.
I'm writing a song for my mom.
don't you want her to feel better?
Yeah, that's why I'm...
don't you have anything else you could be doing, like magically lighting small animals on fire?
why would I do that? -- It's a joke.
never mind. -- I need a favor.
and you've teed it up so successfully.
please don't tell Kyle anything about Cassidy.
Oh.
finally you've opened your eyes up to the hotness next door.
you won't tell him? -- Why do you care if Kyle knows you've been seeing Cassidy?
I just don't think he'd like it.
whatever. But my silence comes with a price.
the keys to your apartment. Mark and I need privacy.
but it's mine. -- Yet you want me to keep your secret.
hmm. What a predicament.
I thought you were done being mean to me. -- This isn't mean.
this is sibling politics. Kill or be killed. Ask Josh.
so do we have a deal or what?
we have a deal. -- You look great.
how do you feel?
well, I can finally go up and down the stairs without feeling like a Ginsu knife is piercing me in the lungs, so pretty good. Oh, scratch that.
what's that? -- Hospital bill.
how much? -- Wow.
too many pages...
Oh, my God. -- Uh, is that before insurance?
I wish.
Stephen, we don't have this kind of money. What are we gonna do?
what are we gonna do about what?
uh... dinner.
you know what? I... I don't feel like cooking.
is she OK? -- Yeah.
she'll be fine. Don't worry about it.
is this sponsored by the university?
the university gives us the space in exchange for bragging rights generated by our ideas.
what kind of ideas? -- Advances in science, technology.
working towards a better, more sophisticated civilization.
I don't have a great history with people who say that.
Yeah, well, forget about everybody else.
we're the real deal.
and this lovely little pixie is Jackie, who holds the record for darts, Guitar Hero and the longest keg stand.
let me know if I can kick your ass at any of them later, cutie.
what's she working on? -- Nuclear suitcase bomb.
plants, mate. Growth patterns.
my goal is to accelerate the maturation period.
a system like hers could help eradicate world hunger.
have you considered binding FT proteins to activate the nucleus of the meristem cells?
no. No, I haven't.
so, the great mind has finally come to play with us mortals.
Yeah, most people open with "hello," but that will work.
Nathanial Harrison, Kyle Trager.
hello. -- Hello.
and goodbye. I've got work to do.
why don't you tell Kyle here what you're working on? Maybe he can help.
uh, no offense, Boy Genius, but I graduated high school at 13, and I have an IQ of 156. I think I got it.
Nate considers himself top dog around here.
he thinks I'm an idiot because I have the IQ of a normal person.
I don't take it personally. I've got better hair.
so, make yourself at home. Get to know everyone.
I believe you already know... -- Mark?
I'm glad we finally got you in here.
easy there. You're hitting a little too close to the promised land.
I love the never-ending role reversal.
the who? -- With us.
first it was you who didn't want to, you know.
then it was me. And now it's you.
wait a minute.
were those little twinkly finger maneuvers your way of telling me that you've changed your mind?
I don't know. Would that be such a bad thing?
are you testing me? Is this a test?
Josh, I'm not testing you.
I just missed you.
I missed you, too. Really bad.
Oh! Ahh! ... to have an exorcism! -- Don't you knock?
don't you lock? -- It's OK. You can look.
Oh! I'm so, so, so sorry.
but I need to talk to you. -- Now?
my cue to leave.
Bye. -- Did you get a How to Screw Your Brother Over handbook the day I was born? -- No, but you were lucky it was me and not Mom!
which is what I wanted to talk to you about.
is there something wrong? -- Yeah.
I caught a glimpse of the hospital bill. They can't pay it.
how do you know that?
they walked me through the finances when they made their will. -- They have a will?
Yes, idiot, and now we have a problem.
so, where's our chief problem solver?
I've been involved for two years. I know I didn't tell you or Lori.
I swear to you, I met her totally by accident. -- Lori needs to know.
OK. You're right. I'll tell her.
I know this is a bit overwhelming for you, your first day and all, but we're good people here.
and we have the best resources available.
it's all about discovery and opportunity.
scientific and financial. - Financial?
Yeah, we're encouraged to chase grants and enter competitions.
for myself, I cleared more than 80, 000 last year.
so, have we won you over yet?
see you later.
I'm here to pay a debt, keep my word.
beyond that, I have no interest in being part of this.
if you can't let go of past impressions, your time here is not going to be productive.
so go home. Seriously, go home.
sleep on it. If you're not back tomorrow morning, then so be it.
debt paid.
deal?
deal.
there has to be something we can do.
we were hoping you could help us figure that out.
Where's Jessi? -- Out.
this was the one place we could privately summit without Mom and Dad stumbling in.
so, what's our strategy? I make minimum wage, and this slacker over here doesn't work at all.
I could take my guitar and play on a street corner.
you'd do better without the guitar.
Hey, enough kidding around.
we're talking thousands of dollars here.
we're never gonna come up with that kind of cash.
I have an idea.
I had been released from my debt to Cassidy, but now a new debt had arrived.
what was the price I'd have to pay for the situation I had created?
and, in the end, would it be worth it?
I had no way of knowing.
but I also knew I had no choice.
Hello, this is Cassidy. Please leave a message.
Cassidy, it's Kyle.
I'll be back tomorrow.
good morning.
I need to know about all available competitions with a cash prize.
suddenly the entrepreneur, eh?
um, no problem. Mark can help you with that.
Hey. A hoverboard competition.
um, the deadline's...
thirty-six hours and 23 minutes.
judged here on campus. It's exactly what I need.
no, I think what you need is a breath.
I know how smart you are, but even if you manage to construct the prototype, highly unlikely, the real question is whether it will work.
Nate's been jamming on this for a year.
he's working the bugs out. -- I have to try.
I really... -- If you could show me where I could work.
Yeah, um, we'll set you up a station here.
so, head over heels or a broken heart?
most songs are about one or the other.
how do you know I'm writing a song? -- I know you pretty well.
Yeah. Yes, you do.
I'm hoping if I write enough songs, I can sell them.
so which one is it?
she's gonna make me say it.
how's that guy, Mark?
that guy, Mark, is... good.
good. -- And you are... ?
good. -- Good.
I guess I'll see you around.
sounds like a whole lot of goodness going on around here.
I'm hoping we can move past the awkward stage.
one minute you're telling each other everything, and the next you don't know what to say.
exactly.
just because you break up with a guy doesn't mean you stop having feelings for him.
I know. I don't want to, but sometimes I still do. I just...
I can't get past the whole Jessi thing.
Kyle does not have feelings for Jessi.
trust me, I would kill him.
she's after him. Jessi's the kind of girl who gets what she wants.
Jessi likes someone else now.
she does? - She's over Kyle.
so, maybe, you don't have to be.
Jessi's got a sweet secret pad.
what's all this?
everything I can afford to part with and not walk around naked.
why is it here? -- Cause if I'm gonna sell everything I own online, I don't want my parents to know. That's where you come in. -- Not remotely following.
you'll be my boxer/shipper. -- I thought you brought me here for more exciting purposes.
that can be the reward for a job well done.
how did you get the keys to this place, anyway?
Lori blackmailed them out of Jessi, I blackmailed 'em out of Lori. -- What do you have on Lori?
nothing. I just inferred things.
she's a guilty person.
you're cute when you're being diabolical.
I just really want to help my mom. -- I know you do.
and I'm happy to help.
but maybe we can get to the reward part first?
someone's in a rush to get to the good stuff.
here we are, alone in our secret little apartment.
no fears of getting caught.
do you have any idea how many couples would kill for a deal like this?
or how much they'd pay for it.
you're a genius!
Oh. Apparently, now I'm also a pimp.
you really think you can build a working prototype in less than two days?
maybe you're not as smart as they think you are. -- Maybe so.
this isn't like playing with Legos.
there's no way you can finish. -- Your board is burning.
what was that for? -- My tomato plants doubled their growth in 12 hours.
that's amazing. -- Thanks to you.
you're so nice. -- Well, why wouldn't I be?
how are you feeling? -- Much better.
good, because I have some news.
I made a decision. I've been thinking about it.
I'm not gonna go to college. -- What?
it doesn't make sense for me to spend four years when all I care about is my music.
Lori! -- Plus, it's so expensive.
Lori, you know I love you and I try to respect your life choices, but this is a non-starter for me.
but... -- Please don't make me play the mom who just got out of the hospital and has a weak heart card.
OK. You need time to process.
there's not enough time in the world for this one.
let me get that. -- I've got it.
mom! -- Lori, I've got it.
all right. Suit yourself.
let me get it. -- I've got... I've got it.
you're not supposed to get it. -- Well, why not?
because we're supposed to treat you delicately until you feel better.
who told you that? -- Lori.
since when do you listen to Lori? -- I guess you're right.
OK, so, uh, where are you coming from?
I was out. -- Wandering the streets aimlessly?
why would I do that?
no, I meant you could tell me more if you want to.
no, I can't.
why not? -- Because I'm not supposed to upset you.
Lori again? -- Kyle.
Kyle? What does he think would upset me?
I really shouldn't be talking to you about this.
I...I think you should.
I think I did something really bad.
and I don't want Kyle to know, but I'm worried that what I did might affect what he's doing.
and then he won't realize what's being done. -- What happened?
Jessi, tell me.
I can't believe you're working with them.
it was the only way to get you help when you were so sick.
I had to make the deal. -- Now you need to unmake it.
Nicole. -- I'm serious, Kyle.
I don't want you involved with those people.
it's not as bad as you think. -- Not as bad?
they followed you, they toyed with you, they kidnapped Amanda!
so far there's been nothing. -- No, don't do that.
don't tell me anything other than that your relationship with them is over.
it can't be over. I'm sorry.
how could you tell her? -- I was worried.
I don't like that you're involved with them.
I don't like that I'm involved with them! But I have to be.
Why? Why can't you just walk away?
I had the chance, but Stephen and Nicole ran into money trouble, so now I can't.
money trouble? -- Yes.
the hospital bill is really high.
Oh. I didn't know that.
I have to help them, no matter what it takes.
why are you always helping people, even if it's hurting you?
because that's what you do, Jessi.
that's what people do. -- But Cassidy's a bad person.
I don't trust him.
what do you know about Cassidy?
Jessi, what do you know about Cassidy?
I met him awhile ago.
he didn't tell me he was part of Latnok, at first.
what did he tell you? -- I thought he was my neighbor.
he lived down the hall from Sarah's apartment, probably as a way of keeping tabs on me.
he told me that Latnok is changing and that you and I can help with that change.
and you believed him? -- I didn't know what to believe.
Sarah hated them, but then she left.
he was there, being so kind and supportive and telling me how important we both were to the future.
when Nicole got injured and she needed help...
you suggested I go see him. -- You would have gone anyway.
but you encouraged me without telling me the whole story!
you did exactly what Cassidy wanted!
I'm sorry. -- I'm working with the people I trust least in this world.
I never thought you'd be just like them.
Hello?
an appointment for what? What apartment?
Hello?
that was one of Josh's friends, canceling a 10:30 appointment.
what appointment?
he hung up. Said something about an apartment.
what do you know about this? -- Nothing. Not a thing.
zero. -- You want to try that again?
Four-ninety-eight, 499, 500. Not bad.
except for the fact I've had to clean this place five times in the past 24 hours.
we could hire a maid. -- That'd cut into our profits.
the last party left the bathroom looking like a chunk-style soup factory exploded.
I've still got to scrub the toilet before the 10:30.
maybe they're not coming. -- Well, they'd better come!
one appointment is 50 dollars less stress my mom has to worry about.
Amen.
I'll get the door, you manage the facilities.
don't think you guys'll get out of paying full price.
what, exactly, are we paying full price for?
dad! Mom!
great to see you!
ANDI. -- Leaving. Now.
I'm late for my family summit, which hopefully goes better than this is about to.
what is going on here? -- A little entrepreneurial venture.
are you in some kind of trouble?
you mean before right now?
why would you need money? -- Andi's birthday.
she's expecting diamonds. -- Well, then start mining.
you're gonna give all this money back, and you're gonna clear out of here immediately.
I just wanted to... -- Just wanted to what?
tell us, please, because we really want to understand.
nothing.
I'm sorry.
I suck.
am I on too many painkillers, or is there something seriously wrong with our children?
don't you ever sleep? -- This has to be done.
you know, I know you're only into it for the prize money now, but, Kyle, I really think you're gonna like it here.
Why? -- Well...
I know, for me, it is the first time I can remember, I'm in a place where I'm not this super-smart outsider. We all are.
it's my home.
I guess I have a different definition of home.
uh, speaking of, I haven't talked to Lori yet.
do you have any tips on how to keep her from hating me?
you're asking the wrong person about keeping secrets from his girlfriend.
whoa. Doogie Howser's got a girlfriend?
not anymore.
is she hot? -- Amanda's a nice girl, Nate.
in other words, totally off-limits to you.
that's a pretty name. -- Leave her out of this.
what's this? You're not satisfied with moving into my project?
you've got to steal my materials now, too?
I didn't steal them.
Cassidy told him he could use our supplies.
was I talking to you?
look, you can't just waltz in here and take over.
I don't want to take over anything. -- Who are you, anyway?
Where'd you come from and where'd you learn to make that?
I'm self-taught. -- That's impossible.
is this kindergarten? We share. We help each other.
well, I'm not helping him.
Kyle isn't here. -- I'm not here to see Kyle.
I made a lasagna. To help out.
OK. I'll take it.
I told you, Kyle isn't here.
and I said I'm not here to see him.
is that why your eyes are darting all over for him?
why do you even care? You already have a new boyfriend.
I don't have a boyfriend.
that's what Lori said.
here. Just take the stupid lasagna.
I heard about the Nate thing. Sorry about that.
ignore him. -- Should I ignore that you were conspiring with Jessi to get me in here?
she told you about that, huh?
good. -- Good?
we've liked the idea of her here for awhile, but so far she hasn't proved to be a very trustworthy girl.
I'm glad to hear that she's honest with you.
maybe there is room for both of you here.
I don't want Jessi to have any part of this.
not after everything you've done to her. And to me.
you have to understand, they wanted you here desperately.
who? -- The old guard, stuffy suits.
they put enormous pressure on me to bring you in.
they wanted their greatest achievement.
you still haven't even told me for what.
do you not see?
that's for you to determine.
inspire them. Be inspired.
shape the future. With you on board there are no limits.
but I'm not on board.
I'm only here to help my family.
what can I do to convince you? How can we earn your trust?
you can't.
what happened?
Nate. -- Bye-bye.
you don't even know what you just did.
I probably don't care, either.
Nate, for God's sake, man, shut it.
Kyle, we can fix this. -- I don't want you to fix it.
you all talk about being family, taking care of your own.
well, I'm going to take care of mine. -- Kyle, wait.
don't.
aren't those Dad's old speakers? -- Yes.
I need the magnets to make the board levitate.
he's gonna kill you, you know.
I tried yours first, but they weren't big enough.
that's...
you what? Oh, bro!
we've got to talk about the concept of personal property.
I thought Latnok had unlimited resources.
I had a setback with them. -- The competition's tomorrow.
and you clearly don't have the right materials. -- I know that.
why don't you just levitate with the board?
cause that would be cheating.
one day we'll discuss this sporadic morals thing you've got going.
I'll have the test scores in by tomorrow. Yeah, thanks, you too.
so do I want to know why half the kitchen appliances are on the driveway?
science project. -- For what?
for fun. You know Kyle.
loves to have fun with science. Good times.
Oh, hi. -- Hi, Mom.
child number one is acting deceptively vague again. -- What is up with them?
Oh, child number four makes an appearance.
Sarah's been sending me these for expenses.
Jessi, this is a lot of money.
we need to open up a bank account for you.
actually, I wanted to give it to you guys.
Oh, no, this is for you.
this is her way of taking care of you.
but she doesn't. You do. I should pay rent.
you're living here as part of our family.
none of the other kids pay rent, so why should you?
Why's everybody so concerned about money lately?
Oh, no. -- What?
the bill. You all know about the bill.
OK, what's going on?
I know you know about the hospital bill.
I'm trying to win a science competition so I can pay your hospital bill.
that's why I went to Latnok.
if I win it I can make the money you owe.
how am I supposed to feel, knowing this is the price you're paying for saving my life?
I am the adult here.
it is my job. It is my responsibility to take care of all of you.
but it's my fault.
I was driving, and I wasn't paying attention.
I was thinking about Adam's death, and what Foss said that night, and I made the wrong turn.
I wasn't focused, and that's when we ran off the road.
Oh, Kyle.
is that what you think? That you're responsible for this?
Yes. Because it's true.
so I'm finishing this project.
I'm winning this competition tomorrow, and I'm fixing this problem that I caused.
and I'm sorry if you're not OK with it, but I won't let you stop me.
I won't stop you.
I just don't think it had to be this way.
so I hear you're solving the world's problems.
I know Nicole's upset, but I'm doing this.
actually, I was just wondering if there's anything I can do to help.
OK. Here we go.
dude, you're floating.
steady, steady.
how's it look? -- Uh, good.
magnets are running a little hot, but they're OK.
we need to prime the fields.
Kyle, you're flying. -- OK, let me go.
you sure?
looking good, Tragers. -- Steady, steady.
I can't compensate!
Stephen, shut it down.
are you OK?
I'm fine. -- The board isn't.
we can fix it. -- Is there time?
it's not about time. It's the magnets.
they're not pure enough. I was hoping we could mimic their chemical makeup. -- But we couldn't. -- Industrial magnets cost thousands of dollars. They're not easy to come by.
I know where we could get some.
no. You're not asking them for anything.
I don't care what the consequences are. -- But we...
Kyle, please.
then it's over. We're done.
Jessi, I don't really feel like talking.
I don't need to talk.
I just want you to have this.
did you get this from Cassidy? -- No.
I cashed the checks that Sarah sent me.
then I tracked down an online supplier who sold me the magnets for half the market value.
do you think it will work? -- I don't know.
but at least now we have a chance.
thank you. -- You're welcome.
no, we've got it. We've got pens for everyone.
I'll start final assembly.
and now our fourth and fifth contestants,
robert Gibson and Linda Tifford.
well, you good? -- Yeah.
praying won't help you now, newbie.
look, I don't quite know how it went down, but we can assume that whatever happened, Nate was out of line.
we've all been there.
so where do you need us?
look, he's all confused.
we're here to help you.
I'd like that. -- Cool.
this is the main frame. I'm gonna need those, too.
now, taking the stage, our final two contestants, Kyle Trager and Nate Harrison.
the current leader had an elevation level of five feet, six and one half inches, 22.4 second duration.
followed closely by five feet, three inches and 19 seconds.
Lori Trager. -- Hey.
you're just the girl I need to talk to.
what are you doing here?
uh... It's a long story that ends with me telling you that I've liked you since the minute we met.
which doesn't excuse the fact that I didn't tell you this before now. I know.
tell me what?
the Latnok organization? The one Kyle's working with?
I'm a part of it. -- You're what?
Yeah. - No.
don't. I can't deal with this right now.
we'll talk about it later.
you know, when you paint a loser gold, you still know what's inside.
I'm just saying.
all right. Begin.
I hope that thing doesn't explode.
"experimental" and "prototype" are just synonyms for "kaboom."
cream always rises to the top.
we have a 50,000 dollar grand prize winner.- Round one goes to you.
Yeah!
there doesn't have to be a round two. -- Don't be so sure about that.
that was amazing. -- Great job.
Kyle, that was so awesome.
congratulations, Kyle.
everything has a price.
I had paid mine, certain of the outcome.
and yet, here I was, wondering if, possibly, I had been wrong.
why are you in such a good mood?
cleaning up other people's trash is punishment.
two reasons. One, Kyle saved the day and we're not on the verge of bankruptcy anymore.
I thought we'd have to sell the house and move, which would've sucked.
and two, after we're done cleaning, we have the apartment all to ourselves.
a swing and a miss. -- Josh, we need to talk.
Oh, no. Role reversal again? -- I wish.
I have some really bad news.
Hey, what's the matter?
you're not sick again, are you?
please tell me you're not 'cause I know you rely on me to be strong, and I don't know if I can handle that.
it's not the cancer.
it's worse.
what could be worse than that?
Cleveland.
excuse me?
you may not be moving, but I am.
my mom got a job she couldn't pass up.
we move at the end of the month.
you can't move.
what about us?
no...
Oh, wow.
we're closed.
I'm the kind of guy who can't take no for an answer.
except I'm tired and I really want to go home. -- You don't look tired.
but I'll get out of your hair.
slink sadly home to ponder the sad state of life without a caffeine buzz.
the pity strategy. Nice.
this is for telling me I don't look tired.
you're saving my life. I'm Nate.
that's a pretty name.
come in.
did you win?
are you still mad?
I don't want to be.
help me understand.
you knew better, yet you did it anyway.
I never wanted to hurt you.
you're the most important person to me in the world.
I just...
I wanted to be accepted by them, and I let him manipulate me.
why would you want to be involved with them at all? --Because it...would have been something that you and I shared.
Jessi, we share a lot of things.
not enough.
I wanted more.
I need to trust that you'll always be honest with me.
otherwise, we won't share anything.
in that case...I guess you should know Amanda came by.
she did?
when? -- The other day.
why didn't you tell me?
cause I think that she still likes you.
what does that have to...
wait, she does?
what does that have to do with you not telling me?
what is it?
why didn't you tell me about Amanda?
because I don't want you to be with her.
I want you to be with me.
join us at Latnok.
participate.
you still haven't told me for what. - Inspire them.
be inspired. Shape the future. With you on board there are no limits.
we have to get away from all this, Jessi, we have to start our new life!
my mother, she left.
she left me. - I'm sorry.
should I ignore the fact that you're conspiring with Jessi to get me in here?
we've liked the idea of her here for a while, but so far she hasn't proved to be a very trustworthy girl.
the Latnok organization, the one Kyle's working with,
I'm a part of it.
you're what?
you're not sick again, are you? - It's not the cancer.
it's worse.- What could be worse than that?
Cleveland. We move at the end of the month.
but I can't be with you when I know I'm losing you to someone else.
you could never lose me. - I already have.
I was gonna tell Amanda everything.
you'll be adding her to a list of people you've already compromised.
Oh, Doogie Howser's got a girlfriend?
not anymore. - Amanda's a nice girl, Nate.
in other words, total off-limits to you.
I'm Nate, by the way.- Amanda.
Amanda came by. - She did?
when? - The other day.
why didn't you tell me about Amanda?
because I don't want you to be with her.
I want you to be with me.
Jessi told you she's on to you? - I was surprised too.
surprised, why?
come on, man. She's had her eye on you since the moment she got her head straight.
what did you say?
he said he doesn't see me that way.
okay, we're talking about the same Cassidy who was all over you?
Cassidy, yeah. - That's so weird.
I could've sword I saw him throwing you the "sex me" vibe.
he said he just wants to be my friend.
you actually said you just want to be friends?
Yes. What?
that's the one sentence no girl ever wants to hear.
trust me. I've busted it out once or twice.
but it's the truth. - It's basically a nicer way of saying, - "I reject you completely." - I didn't know that.
well, lucky for you, Jessi probably didn't, either.
what did she say?
you ran away?
I haven't talked to him since. - But you still like him?
okay. All is not lost. We can fix this.
Really?
first step, stabilize the situation.
stabilize.
well, Cassidy's gonna be a little freaked out so you have to un-freak him.
how do I do that?
take it all back.
how do I take it back?
just tell him you were drunk or feverish or caught the Ebola virus or something.
that doesn't seem like a very good plan.
just tell him you had a temporary moment of craziness, but it's past and you are 100 percent over it.
done. Complete.
and you think that will work? - Trust me.
I have years of high school under my belt.
you know, it's possible to have feelings for two girls at the same time.
but I don't think I have feelings for Jessi.
you don't think or you don't?
I guess I've never thought about it before.
right. I mean, how could it have possibly occurred to you that you and Jessi could be compatible?
I mean, tons of people can communicate telepathically, leap off buildings, and move water with their minds.
I love Amanda.
I always have.
then get back together with her. - I can't. Not yet, anyway.
why not? - I can't try to win Amanda back until I'm completely sure that Latnok can be trusted.
well, you better get moving on that.
how you doing? - Good.
well, man, one thing's for sure. You've got your hands full.
I take it back. - Take what back?
what I said.
I...
had a temporary moment of craziness, but it's passed and I'm 100 percent over it.
done. Complete.
or it may have been Ebola. - Ebola?
never mind. No.
Jessi, I... - No.
we don't need to talk about it.
you're my friend. Everything else...
I was just confused.
I wanted to be closer to you, and I got confused.
so if you're freaking, it's okay to un-freak.
I'm...
not...
freaking.
good.
me neither.
wait.
are you going to Latnok?
Yes.
take me with you.
it's not dangerous.- We still don't know for sure.
Nicole's fine with you going there now. And, you said they're just a group of smart kids that like science.
I want to be a part of that.
please.
I need to feel like I'm a part of something.
I'll talk to Cassidy.
I'm well aware of Jessi's gifts, but I also know that she's volatile and unpredictable.
she's trying to change.
she is who she is.
and I can't risk disrupting the harmony of a very select group of students.
so you consider Nate to be a harmonious person?
I'm not saying he's not a challenge. But...
Jessi...- What?
her mother's no friend of Latnok.
what do you know about Sarah?
I know she's an extraordinary person.
but I also know that she's headstrong and contentious. And...
doesn't share our vision. - Well, Jessi's not her mother.
she wants to be here, to participate.
I'll vouch for her.
in that case, how can I say no?
thank you.
you're welcome.
I'm totally wiped, but playing tourist was exactly what I needed.
I'm really gonna miss it.
I wouldn't worry. I'm sure Cleveland has a Space Needle.
and a Pike's Market.
are you really gonna do this?
what? Is it my fault Cleveland is so lame?
why are you ruining such a great day?
why are you ruining such a great relationship?
like I have a choice!
you know this is hard for me, too.
I really don't need you piling on the guilt, making me feel even worse.
sure. Yeah. Bail on me, just like you're bailing on Seattle.
idiot!
this is quite an occasion. You're just in time to receive your assignments.
since when do we get assignments?
since we have a very important project underway, the preparations for which are strictly confidential.
it's a party.
a party? - That's right.
we throw one every year for members from other schools.
Jackie-licious, you are in charge of the guest list.
Mr. Deejay, music.
anger Management, libations.
and our two newest members, you, are in charge of the "wow.
the wow? - The wow.
the idea behind the party, the theme.
I want it to combine social interaction with science.
you'll work on it together.
with your two minds, I'm sure you'll come up with something fabulous.
a party?
you're supposed to be getting the dirt on these people, and you're throwing a party with them?
maybe there's no dirt to get.
and...
if there's not, then I can finally tell Amanda how I feel.
which is what I want, more than anything.
how are you doing? - I'm excellent. How are you?
dude, there's not much you can do now.
I can't just stand here.
can I get a cup of coffee?
you don't drink coffee. - I know. It's just for...
Hey, it looks like you two need to talk.
do you want to talk about something?
not right now.
well, then, what were you saying? - I was asking.
right. And my answer is yes.
yes? Yes to what? - Kyle, it's none of your business.
Amanda just accepted my invitation to our party this weekend.
our" party?
what do you have to do with it?
I'm working with a group of students at the U-Dub Science Department.
so, you two know each other?
is that a problem?
no. - Yes.
it doesn't work this way. You can't interfere.
except the party he's talking about, it's a party for single people.
what?
you can't bring a date. That's the rule.
since when? - That's okay.
I'm single, you're single. Maybe we'll run into each other.
I'll make sure of it.
meeting you was a coincidence.
it had nothing to do with getting Kyle to join Latnok.
it still seems like creepy, undercover, double agent crap.
Yeah, I admit we're secretive about our membership, but,
I want you, Lori, for you.
I don't know. Something tells me you got off running around like some nerdy James Bond.
I guess if anything I kind of saw myself as a...
as a somewhat less nerdy Moby.
you wish!
how could Amanda want to go out with such a...
such a jerk?
language, please.
what?
jealous Kyle.
it's a whole new side of you. I like it.
I'm not jealous. I'm...
okay, I am, but it's more than that. Nate's not a good person.
well, if he's such a dirtbag...- Hot dirtbag.
let her go out with him. Amanda will wise up.
Yeah, 'cause it's not like she has a history of dating hot dirtbags.
exhibit A, Charlie Tanner. I swear, I'm trying to help.
well, stop. - No, Lori's right.
Amanda always sees the best in people, and I don't want Nate to take advantage of her.
I have to work on ideas for this party.
he's screwed.- Totally.
we can throw an ice party.
we can have everyone dress in white like at Diddy's parties.
Diddy? - I've been reading Lori's magazines.
Jessi, I'm sorry. I know you want to impress everyone, but my head's just not in it.
because of Amanda?
he's not right for her! Why can't she see that?
stabilize.
what?
tell me how Amanda makes you feel.
Jessi, I can't do that.
Why?
cause I shouldn't talk to you about things like that.
why not? We're friends.
I was just confused, remember?
are you sure that's what it was?
Yes.
you have Amanda, so you already understand the difference between friendship and love.
I just don't understand it yet.
help me.
OK. Well...
the first time I saw her, my heart started pounding.
I felt shaky and lightheaded.
my palms got sweaty.
well, that sounds like a chemical reaction.
when body chemistry matches, the pheromones are naturally drawn to each other.
makes sense.
I didn't feel that with you.
you didn't? - I don't think so.
no, definitely not.
do you think Amanda felt that with Nate?
I don't know. I can't just ask her.
well, it would help if you knew they had true chemistry.
you should test their physiological compatibility.
if they have no chemistry, you have nothing to worry about.
the party.
what about it?
we could call it a chemistry party.
where people can get matched based on their physiological compatibility.
is this our wow? - It's our wow.
it's exactly what I need to prove to Amanda that she and Nate aren't meant to be together.
what's this? - A mood ring.
you put it on, it tells you if you're in a good mood or a bad one.
you don't need a ring to tell you that.
it's so other people can see.
how does it work? - Reads your body temperature.
if you're in a good mood, your temperature's slightly up, causing a bright color.
if you're in a bad one your temperature's down, and the color's dark.
so how would this prove if two people are compatible?
we can design something to read a person's pheromone levels, and produce a color based on its results.
so if two people have the same color, they're a good match.
if they're not the same color, they're not a good match.
DNA dating? Cool.
but I need to test it first.
I need to confirm that Amanda and Nate are two different colors.
how can I help?
I need DNA samples from both of them.
I can distract Nate while you grab something from his desk.
that's perfect. - Wait. What about Amanda?
I've already got someone taking care of it.
what the hell are you doing?
what am I doing? What are you doing?
I'm preventing someone from finding hair in their smoothie.
what are you talking about? My hair has never ended up in a smoothie.
not yet. But the moment it does, we kiss our A rating goodbye. You want that to happen?
no, but... - But nothing.
keep it in check, Bloom.
don't make me institute a hair net policy.
it's so great to finally meet you.
I mean, I know we said we'd meet at the party tomorrow, but I just couldn't wait. Can you believe it?
we're finally standing in front of each other.
are you freaking out? I'm totally, totally freaking out.
freaking out.
who are you? - It's me.
Kbug223. From Cool zone?
cool zone?
we've only spent the past week chatting about everything from G-Force to Cabbage Patch dolls.
keep it down.
what? I think it's adorable you had one.
how do you know all this stuff about me?
you told me, silly.
look, I gotta go, but I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Hey, Nate. - Hi, New Girl.
you're good at decrypting computer code, right?
Ah, you heard of Gates, Allen, Jobs...
morons.
well, I thought you might be able to help me out with a little problem I've been having.
why don't you just get your boy to do it?
because you're smarter.
Yeah, I can spare a minute.- Great.
Yeah, I'm on my way out the door. I'll see you in 20.
looking for me?
I just wanted to thank you for letting Jessi be part of this.
well, she seems to be getting along with everyone so far.
your plans for the party going well?
I think we came up with something interesting.
good. I'm looking forward to it.
is there anything else?
that's it.
so... ?
I think I've properly stabilized. - Excellent.
step one is complete. - Except...
I think he still has feelings for his ex-girlfriend.
exactly why there's a step two.
neutralize.
ditch the other chick. - Ditch her?
remove the competition.
eliminate her.
I didn't mean that literally.
I know. - Seriously, don't go sneak up behind her in a dark alley.
knocking her unconscious is not an option.
that was one time only.
lucky me.
so...
what's the best way for me to neutralize her?
I don't know.
you're the super smart one. You'll figure it out.
royal Grace Investments. Whatever you can find.
Thanks, Declan.
Hey. - Hi.
how's it going? - I think I figured it out.
this crystal will change color based on a person's pheromone output.
we can make necklaces out of those.
for people to wear, so everyone can see their color.
that's perfect.
let's try it out. This is Nate's DNA.
I'll put a drop on the crystal, which should produce a color.
it's green.
and now Amanda's.
hopefully it's a different color.
it's red.
they're not a match.
now Amanda will think twice about being with Nate.
great.
so what's next?
everyone else at Latnok seems genuine.
but I'm still not convinced about Cassidy.
he's hiding something in his office.
like what?
I don't know.
but once I check it out, if it's nothing, maybe I can get my life back.
and hopefully Amanda.
Hi. - Hi.
can I get by? - Sorry.
do you want to ride together to the party?
I need to get the necklaces ready. You should just go with Josh and Lori.
Josh and Lori aren't coming. - Yes, they are. I invited them.
there's no way Nicole would let them go to a party sponsored by Latnok.
she and Stephen are gone until later tonight.
Jessi, you have to uninvite them.
I'm not uninviting them.
they've just started to tolerate me. I don't want to be
Downer-Doug-Party-Police.
what's that?
that's what they call you.
they do? - Yes.
but feel free to uninvite them yourself.
if you want to.
never mind.
drop the controller.
I thought we were playing G-Force today.
not until you tell me who that stalker was at The Rack.
she seemed very cool.
are you insane? - Practical.
I want to make sure you have someone after I move.
just because you're moving to Cleveland, doesn't mean we have to be over.
what's your favorite part of our relationship?
I don't know. I mean, just being around you, I guess.
well, your favorite part of our relationship will no longer be able to happen.
then I'll find a new favorite. - Josh, I'm moving.
whether you accept it or not, it's happening.
you have to let me go.
you know, I thought you'd be the one fighting to keep us together.
guess I was wrong.
you're not looking at this the right way.
I am now.
where are you going? - To call Katie and ask her what time I should pick her up tonight.
turns out Royal Grace Investments own the building where Cassidy and Jessi have an apartment.
check this out.
it's the lease to Cassidy's place.
how'd you get this?
called pretending to be from my dad's law firm.
check the date it was signed.
Cassidy moved in the same day Sarah took off.
you don't think it's coincidence?
is anything in your life ever just a coincidence?
someone's excited.
does that mean what I think it means?
step two complete. - That was fast.
I promise I didn't hit anyone. - Glad to hear it.
so, I've stabilized.
I've neutralized.
now I can get him. - Not quite.
what's wrong? Do I not look okay?
no, you look great. Just not hot.
it's time for step three.
there's a step three? - You need to "sexy."
I definitely don't know how to do...
follow me.
chemistry party. It's genius.
these necklaces are awesome.
never seen so many people happy to be single.
I'm glad it all worked out.
have you seen Nate? - I think he's over at the bar.
Thanks, Mark.
Kyle. You know, I have to say, good job.
Thanks. - Hey, Kyle.
your necklace, it's green.
Yeah, isn't it amazing?
Amanda and I are a perfect match.
I think Nate did something to the necklaces. I have to tell Amanda.
don't forget why you're here. - I haven't.
that's why I have to tell her what kind of person he is.
no, what you need to do is get into Cassidy's office.
looking for Kyle?
was I that obvious?
whatever happened between you, he was crazy to let you go.
he didn't.
I caught him kissing someone else.
I'm sorry.
you deserve someone who appreciates you.
it's hard to see them together. - I know it is, but you can't waste this opportunity.
you have a chance to end this, and know once and for all where Cassidy stands.
he's over there. Keep an eye on him.
and I'll keep the other one on Amanda.
Jessi, you look beautiful.
thank you.
ours don't work.
I guess our body chemistry reacts differently in some way.
I think Nate may have done something to affect the results.
how?
we'll figure it out later.
I have to go.
unbelievable. - What?
she's not into Cassidy at all. - Who, Jessi?
no. She's totally into Kyle.
everyone can see that. - Well, apparently, not everyone.
I know.
I'm an embarrassing shade of lavender.
we're not gonna let our lives be dictated by these little crystals?
no, we are not.
you're a yellow.
what do you know?
I'm Jackie. - Declan.
can I be honest, Declan?
go right ahead.
I've had some bad luck with guys the past...
...five or six years.
I was gonna come here, grab a few, then head home early and pass out after a bowl of coffee ice cream.
well, that sounds pretty honest to me.
so, my question is, are you a good guy, or am I just wasting my time?
well, can I be honest with you?
I'm about 80 percent good guy.
those are pretty good odds.
excuse me. Jackie, have you seen Kyle around at all?
Yeah. I think I just saw him... - Outside. Getting some air.
great. Thanks.
I think we need some refills.
he's coming.
is everything okay? - Yeah.
great. It's just been a long time since I've been out with anyone but my girlfriend.
if it makes you feel better, you're the first guy I've gone out with since Brett dumped me on IM.
he dumped you by IM?
I avoided computers for two weeks after that.
but I'm glad I didn't hang up my keyboard forever, cause, you know, if I had, I would have never met you.
and hey, look. You're blue and I'm blue.
so what do you say we forget about the exes and have fun?
great, let's go. - Okay.
so did you find anything?
what are you doing? - Get away from her.
he's only using you to get back at me.
man, your ego is showing. He's just jealous because we have a connection.
no, you don't. Not like we do.
our party favors that you made say that we do.
cause you tampered with them!
you did something to Amanda's necklace to make her think you're compatible.
the hell, I did. - He did it.
how do you know that? - I tested them.
your necklace should be red, not green.
you don't have chemistry. Your colors shouldn't match.
and ours should?
is that your point?
chemistry is not about some stupid color on a necklace.
it's about what you feel in your heart!
you used to know that better than anyone.
I guess you're not as smart as I thought you were.
I have to go!
you really know how to spoil a good time.
Amanda was right.
the laws of science don't apply to matters of the heart.
but jealousy had clouded my thinking.
true chemistry can't be forced or manipulated.
and a genuine relationship can only be built or restored with honesty and mutual respect.
I failed Amanda.
I'd failed us.
you are an incredible liar. - Excuse me?
Oh, please. Don't play all Martha Stewart pre-jail with me.
it was never about Cassidy. It was always Kyle!
I didn't know what to do.
until messing with Amanda's necklace came to mind.
you told me to neutralize. Ditch the other chick.
that was before I knew the other chick was Amanda.
your advice would have been different if you knew she was the other girl?
of course. She's my friend.
look, Jessi... - I'm sorry.
I can't change how I feel about Kyle.
maybe not, but if you want any hope of him caring about you, you'd better be somebody worth caring about.
Kyle deserves someone a hell of a lot better than someone who would pull this crap behind his back.
you know, I'm having a really great time tonight.
me too.
I'm sorry.
as much as I want to, I can't.
but...
I don't understand. I thought everything was going great.
it is.
I mean, you're a perfect match for me.
but I already have one.
you all right, mate?
I'm fine.
I wanted to talk to you about something, about the jewelry.
the jewelry? - The reimbursement for the necklaces.
this should take care of it.
Thanks.
it's a raging success.
I guess you and Jessi are an unbeatable combination.
Congratulations.
so what did you find?
Sarah's ring was in his safe. which makes me wonder - what he had to do to get it. - You sure it was Sarah's ring?
Adam gave it to her.
it has a red stone, and it's one of a kind.
you were right not to trust him.
you know, I really didn't want to find anything.
I was really hoping that...
I can't get my life back.
I can't be with Amanda.
guess our non-date ended that badly, huh?
you'd rather work the night shift than be with me?
I was just helping myself to a cup.
do you want one?
it's on the house.
no, thanks.
can I ask you something?
Yeah, sure.
was Kyle right?
did you only ask me out to get back at him?
absolute truth?
at first, yes.
the thing is, once we were there, I had a really great time.
me, too.
good night, Amanda.
good night.
please, Jessi, leave me alone.
I'm sorry about tonight.
for once you weren't the one responsible.
Yes, I am.
I messed with your necklace.
I wanted you to get together with Nate.
Why?
because if you were with him, then I could...
you could be with Kyle.
but it doesn't matter what I do.
even if you were with Nate, Kyle would still want to be with you.
and you want to be with him.
I see the way you watch him when you know he's not looking.
you still love him.
it doesn't matter.
I can't let myself get hurt again.
forget what you think you know about him.
all he's ever done is love you with his whole heart.
why are you telling me this?
because I care about him.
and you told me when you care about somebody, you put their needs first.
Kyle needs you, so I won't be getting in your way anymore.
honestly, I have never seen a group of grown people act like a bigger bunch of babies.
jealousy makes people do crazy things.
I guess.
maybe I'd just hoped we were all a more evolved species.
do I need to remind you we're talking about a bunch of teenagers?
okay, you are so not allowed to pull age rank on me.
I'm the one who handled this whole evening properly.
with class.
and poise.
and maturity beyond your years. - Exactly.
good night. - Do you need a ride home?
actually, no. I...
I sort of have one.
you ready to go?
cute.
shall we? - Yeah.
you're an idiot. - I'm an idiot.
I can't believe I thought I could handle is gonna make up for the fact my current girlfriend is moving? You're a bigger idiot.
see her again, I'll kill you. Dead.
I panicked.
I couldn't figure out how to pack you up and ship you to Cleveland with the rest of my stuff.
you try Pack-N-Ship on Third? They have great rates.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
you know that, right?
of course you do.
who wouldn't?
I love you, too.
Amanda, I...
I didn't think you'd want to see me.
I don't want to be mad anymore.
I feel like that's all I've been lately.
I'm so confused about what to think of you.
and the only thing I can do to get through it is to follow my heart.
my heart says that there's still something there.
please say something.
this person I am, this life I lead, it's...
it's different than anyone else's.
I'm different.
I know that.
you know some of it.
but there are things that I could never tell you.
and people who want things from me, who know that the way to get to me is through the people I love.
what does that mean, "get to you?
it means that as much as I want us to be together, we can't.
why does that get to be your choice?
because my choice is to protect you.
always.
you don't need to protect me.
what you need to do is explain.
I'm sorry.
but I can't.
is something wrong?
I found something.
in Cassidy's office.
he has Sarah's ring.
what?
how?
I don't know, but I think it might have something to do with her disappearance.
no, she didn't disappear. She left.
I know we both thought that, but... - No.
how do you explain this?
the letter she left? The checks she's been sending?
I'm not sure.
Cassidy gave me this.
look at the "T."
the cross bars are identical on all of them.
the same person wrote all of this.
Cassidy wrote this?
and the letter?
Why?
I don't know.
I can't believe this.
all this time I thought she left because she hated me.
no one could ever hate you.
Jessi, please. I hate seeing you like this.
my mother didn't leave me.
she didn't leave me!
she didn't leave.
I don't think she did.
I need to find out what happened to her.
promise me you'll help me find out.
I promise.
is there a romantic interest I'm not aware of?
only Kyle. - Kyle?
I've see one of these symbols before.
Kyle has a ring with this on it.
he got it from his birth father.
Adam something. - Adam Baylin?
if Andi can't stay here, then she has to move to Cleveland.
I know that's gonna be hard for you to deal with.
everyone at Latnok seems genuine.
but I'm still not convinced about Cassidy.
seen anyone around my office?
I caught Jessi there this morning.
Jessi? I'm well aware of Jessi's gifts, but I also know she's volatile and unpredictable.
her mother's no friend of Latnok.
what do you know about Sarah?
I found something in Cassidy's office.
he has Sarah's ring. - How?
something to do with her disappearance.
recall your experiences from that night and examine your memories.
it's working.
I see something.
he killed her!
she's dead!
my mother is dead.
we need to find out why he did it.
we will.
Hi, Jessi. I didn't know you were here.
what's wrong?
I... - It's OK.
what happened?
I heard you thrashing around.
it was just a bad dream.
it was terrible.
I was at Latnok and... I don't really remember.
well, it's over now. Are you OK?
thank you for checking on me.
it's late.
we should get back to sleep.
OK. Good night.
good night.
listen, Josh, I know you're upset about Andi leaving.
I've been walking around with a pit in my stomach.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
every time I think about her being gone...
but she's not yet.
don't waste your last few days together moping around.
what am I supposed to do?
give her a big send-off.
what are her favorite things?
g-force.
but just playing that for three days straight would be, well, what we always do.
she's into the Cowkeys, but they're out on tour.
and Star Trek.
star Trek? Popular science-fiction entertainment, encompassing six television series and several feature films.
well, thank you, Mr. Wikipedia.
have you seen any of them? - No.
we'll take you when the new movie comes out.
you'll like Spock. He's half-Vulcan, half-human.
Vulcan?
alien race.
so he's different than everyone else.
he struggles to understand human emotion.
sees the world from a unique perspective.
sounds interesting.
Ah, our man from the pod can relate.
except Spock's got really big ears.
which I have out in the garage.
you own Spock ears?
want to dig 'em up?
impress Andi? Come on.
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you.
that's not easy to do.
is something wrong?
well...I need to talk to you about something.
I saw you the other night.
kissing Jessi.
I'm sorry.
no, you don't need to apologize.
the two of you have shared so much. You have a unique bond.
it's not that surprising that you'd be attracted to each other.
it is, to me.
I mean, Jessi's always been really important to me, but... these new feelings...
I just don't how to deal with them.
feelings are confusing for ordinary teenagers living in separate houses.
it's so much more complicated for the two of you.
so, what do we do?
you may not like it, but you and Jessi live here together, as part of our family.
and for you to pursue that kind of relationship, well, it's just not appropriate.
I'm sorry, Kyle. I haven't set this kind of boundary with you before.
it won't happen again.
thank you.
I don't want either of you to be hurt.
and you know how fragile Jessi is.
Hey. I just signed for this.
what is it?
the label not clear enough for you?
I've got a new project for you.
Oh, yeah?
I want you to team up with Kyle.
Seriously?
Yeah. It's the formula for a growth accelerant.
we've been trying to crack it for months.
the two of you can make some headway.
I don't want to work with him.
ask Jessi.
no, that ain't gonna happen.
I need someone I can trust.
besides, play nicely with Kyle, and you might make progress with that chick you're seeing.
I'll e-mail you the assignment.
police are searching for any clues that may shed light on the murder of a hunter found in the woods near Victor Falls almost a month ago.
the victim's throat was crushed.
so far, police have no motive for the killing and no suspects have been named.
come on, people, move it along.
I thought you were open for business.
that's right. My business.
we were just... - Tell you what.
sibling benefit.
ten minutes. Start slurping.
this may be one of the few places we can be alone together.
Jessi? - What?
did you listen in on me and Nicole this morning?
Yes, and I don't think it's any of her business.
we live in her house.
we're part of her family.
so kissing me meant nothing to you?
of course it meant something to me.
then how could you not want to be together?
Kyle, when you kissed me, I felt such a rush through my entire body.
didn't you feel it?
is it me, or are you getting a vibe?
trying not to. But they're definitely sitting at least two inches closer than they used to.
you don't think they're...?
I don't wanna talk about it.
can we talk about something else?
Absolutely.
so how goes things with you and Nate?
good. - That's great.
you don't like him.
I don't really know him.
how well do you?
it's still really new.
I guess he doesn't talk about himself too much.
I don't want to dump on what could be a really good thing for you.
I just want you to be careful.
make sure you can trust this guy, that's all.
Amanda. Hey. - Nate, hi.
how's it going? - Good.
good. Is Kyle around? - Kyle?
he's back there. Why?
I just want to partner up on a project with him.
that's really nice.
well, uh, see you later? - Yeah.
am I interrupting anything?
no.
so Cassidy's got something for us to work on together. You up for it?
you and me?
why didn't Cassidy ask me to work with Kyle?
I don't know. He doesn't like you.
well?
fine. - Good.
you'll have another chance to impress me.
we can't be together at Latnok either.
we can't let Cassidy know we suspect anything.
we can't cause any trouble.
if he wants me and Nate to work together, we have to go along with it.
time's up. Get out.
Hey. You're home early. Where's Kyle?
at Latnok, without me. - Oh.
I'm not as fragile as you think.
Jessi... - You don't understand how much Kyle means to me.
I know how close you feel to him.
no. Nobody cares about me like he does.
no one makes me feel as happy or as safe.
I need that. I need him.
Jessi, Kyle can still be there for you.
but while you're both living in this house, he can't be with you, not in that way.
I need to know why you have a problem with Jessi.
she, uh...She was poking around in here the other day.
I think she may have broken into my safe.
why would she do that?
I was hoping you could tell me.
I don't know anything about it.
well, did you know that after your mother's car accident,
Jessi said to me that if I ever harmed you or your family, she'd kill me.
she was just being protective.
she could never do anything like that.
Really?
Jessi's a good person.
she's lucky to have a friend like you.
I'm just not sure you know who you're really dealing with.
is that all?
Yeah.
you scared me.
I owe you a few.
what are you doing?
reading you.
what?
I know the look when a girl has a boy on her mind.
what?
you tell me. You can't keep those kinds of secrets in this house.
Kyle kissed me.
wait a second, clarify. Did he actually kiss you?
or did you throw yourself at him? - He kissed me.
there was no throwing involved.
why does everyone think that's so wrong?
because it's Kyle, of the pure and beautiful soul.
we only want what's best for him.
which means not me.
no. - Get out.
get out!
God, I hate myself sometimes.
why do I say cruel things to people?
uh, to Declan, Hillary or Jessi?
Jessi was the lucky recipient.
but I couldn't help it.
am I supposed to ignore that the two of you were huddled up at the Rack?
huddled up? - We were just talking.
sharing secrets. - Lori.
what kind of secrets?
have anything to do with Latnok?
Yes. Most of the students there have been great.
it's Cassidy I need to know more about.
so I have to make him believe I'm on his side.
you need an olive branch.
an overture.
ask him out to dinner.
invite him here.
if you want him to believe he's winning you over, a dinner invitation from your parents...
I'd like to meet this guy anyway.
no, I don't want him in this house.
Kyle, you're not doing this unless we're part of it.
you and Josh shouldn't be here. - But I want to be.
you make Cassidy too uncomfortable.
why is everybody shutting me out?
I haven't done anything wrong.
Jessi... - You don't want me around either.
you know that's not true.
know what? I won't bother any of you anymore.
you'd better leave the door open.
you know, what we're doing with Cassidy is all about you.
I'm trying to figure out why Sarah was killed, and I need him to trust me.
so if he wants to drive a wedge between us, we have to let him.
I just hate how everyone's looking at me like I'm this horrible person.
nobody in the family does.
and you shouldn't care what Cassidy thinks about you.
fine. Have your dinner. I'll stay away.
Jessi, I need to know that you're committed to this.
I have to trust that you can keep things under control.
don't you know me well enough to be sure?
I just don't want any surprises.
Lori, I need you to help me with something.
but you'll have to keep it a secret.
espionage? All over it.
so what's my mission?
I need to know more about Cassidy.
I think we should adjust the floor value here.
too many ideal elements.
the algorithm lost stability about three adjustments ago.
you're right.
easy to miss.
apparently, not for you.
Cassidy teamed us up. He must think you can contribute.
Cassidy just wants us to get along.
I know he supervises everything, but have you ever seen him report to anybody?
why do you ask?
curious.
well, I have no idea who he answers to.
all those senior Latnok guys, they're all cloak and dagger, minus the dagger.
right.
so, what do we got?
maybe if we adjust the values in this sequence here...
that's it.
Cassidy's had people working on this for months and you solved it.
just like that.
we solved it.
I guess we're done.
I wanted to thank you.
for what?
for making an effort with Nate.
it means a lot to me.
I just want you to be happy, Amanda.
I want the same for you.
so, what's this big surprise? G- Force marathon?
give me more credit than that.
well, show me already.
not yet. Still gotta kick out a couple of paying customers so I can reap benefits that come with minimum wage authority.
Ooh, it turns me on when you go crazy with power.
just give me a minute.
whatever it is, he hasn't stopped working on it.
Yeah, he's such a cute worker bee when he puts his mind to something.
all right, guys, time's up.
makes me sad to think his ambition might stop when I leave.
I don't know about that.
he's already offered to take half of my shifts next week.
I think he wants to stay busy so he doesn't miss you as much.
I'm sorry, did I say something?
no, it's fine. It's just...
my moms changed our plans.
we're not leaving in three days.
we're leaving in the morning.
and Josh doesn't know?
this is our last night together.
Mrs. Trager, I presume.
Mr. Cassidy. - It's Michael, please.
these are for you.
Oh. They're beautiful.
please, come in.
thank you.
pleasure, sir.
Kyle, how you doing, man?
Hey, dude. - Hello.
it smells, uh, ridiculously delicious in here.
don't let that fool you.
can I get you a drink?
I'd love one. Thank you.
you know what it is?
give a girl a minute.
the lights, like little stars, shiny surfaces.
it feels very... futuristic.
an interesting observation, Miss Jensen.
Oh, my God.
I love Star Trek.
I wanted to give you something really special.
you did.
so you know what to do?
the mission is clear.
you love this, don't you?
nothing like a little intrigue and reconnaissance to light up the night.
here they come. Hey!
sorry. Too much?
Yeah, a little. A tad. Just, uh, act natural.
Hey, we just bumped into each other.
so did us.
I mean, we were both here waiting for you, separately.
and then we decided to sit at this table. Here at the Rack.
and we're all here now, so you guys want to hang out for a few?
um, OK.
great. - Fantastic.
Hi.
this is wonderful.
thank you.
I haven't had a good home-cooked meal in I don't even know how long.
where is home, Mr. Cassidy?
Brooklyn.
OK.
uh, England. East London.
little town called Hackney.
still have family there?
we've scattered.
but I love Seattle. And my work keeps me busy, so...
Kyle tells us you're not a scientist.
no. I'm definitely missing that gene.
so, what exactly is your contribution at Latnok?
I foster.
I encourage. Basically, I'm a professional nag.
Kyle can attest to my persistence.
Yes, I can.
I think we'd all like to hear what's expected of Kyle.
Jessi, what are you doing here?
I live here.
I thought you had plans to be out tonight.
I changed my mind.
well, we were just having dinner.
great. Is there a place for me?
of course there is.
I'll get you a plate.
it must be exciting to have two minds like Kyle's and Jessi's mix.
Oh, thrilling! Thrilling.
Kyle's a natural-born leader.
and Jessi shows great potential.
this brownie is amazing.
so good you want to save some for later.
my cobbler's pretty great.
want some?
Trager doesn't eat cooked fruit.
so, what are you guys doing later?
whatever it is, we can't go back to my house.
I've been banished.
your boss, Cassidy, is over for dinner with Kyle and my parents.
he's not our boss.
I thought he called the shots.
Oh, I get it. What happens at Latnok, stays at Latnok.
that's right, top secret.
no, we like to keep the details confidential, but... I think I can trust you.
Cassidy's in charge, but we have tons of freedom.
he knows when to help and when to get out of our way.
so you like working with him?
he's fine.
Yeah, whatever. He's, um...
you know, we should get going if we're gonna catch a movie. - No!
I mean, I wanna try your cobbler.
you used to dream about Mr. Spock?
Oh, in my mind, we were dating.
I was only 12, remember?
it was innocent.
we'd do things like eat cotton candy and play foosball at the International Space Station.
three days before you leave, and you pull out this great goofy stuff.
thank you.
for what?
I just don't think I've said it enough.
you've been so great.
I haven't been the typical first girlfriend and you've always been there for me.
through everything.
and I have to tell you...
whoa. Stop.
no heartfelt goodbyes.
we still have plenty of time for that.
Yeah, but... - No buts.
tonight is about you and me in our own private universe.
you want to go where no man has gone before?
or just once before?
how long have you been waiting to say that?
all night long.
Michael, you know, Kyle and Jessi share very unusual backgrounds.
two peas in a pod, so to speak.
we've tried to keep their lives very private.
my biggest concern is that they always stay protected.
Absolutely.
look, my apologies for Latnok's regrettable actions on prom night.
regrettable is putting it mildly.
fair enough.
but let me assure you, from this point forward,
Kyle and Jessi's well-being is always at the forefront.
you know what I'd like to hear about?
my mother.
what? He must know Sarah.
certainly I've heard of her.
brilliant woman.
Oh, so you've never met?
never had the pleasure.
really.
Jessi, you know she's been in hiding for years.
she wants nothing to do with Latnok.
that's right.
she didn't trust you.
she never met me.
it's Latnok she had... has a problem with.
Nate and I finished that project for you.
so soon? Great. You must be working well together.
he was very helpful.
what was the project about?
we don't know anything about this guy and he's here having dinner.
Jessi. - He doesn't trust me?
I don't trust him.
Jessi, please.
he's done terrible things.
what are you talking about?
you're a liar!
you have secrets.
maybe we should tell this family about the secret you've been keeping from them.
I think it's beholden upon me to tell you what sort of person you have living under your roof.
you remember that first night, Jessi.
after the explosion...
you found your way out of the pod and left Zzyzx.
you took a little wander in the woods.
you came across a man camping.
no.
a stranger to you.
please stop.
and you killed him.
an hour out of the pod, and she murdered someone.
I'm afraid that's the sort of person that she is.
it's in her nature.
Jessi, what is he saying?
I have the news reports.
the murder's still unsolved. - I didn't murder him.
he had a knife. - Then it's true?
no. I was alone. I was scared.
he tried to attack me.
Oh, my God. - I'm not a killer!
I'm not a killer.
wait!
I'm terribly sorry.
I hate to drop news like that on you.
I just can't believe it.
it's a lot to take in.
but I do feel I had to tell you.
we've been concerned about Jessi for quite some time.
knowing that she's here with your family now...
I don't think any of us want someone so...
unpredictable getting closer to Kyle.
are you OK?
she was so upset.
I just hope she's all right.
this is why he's extraordinary.
he's only concerned about her.
so is it off-limits, or can you tell us what you're working on at Latnok now?
unbelievable.
what's with this super perky friendly routine?
I'm showing interest. I'm being nice.
that's so not like you.
it's sweet that you're trying to connect with me as Declan's ex-girlfriend.
see? I'm sweet.
I'm trying to connect.
and in answer to your question, I've got a bunch of new ideas, too soon to discuss.
you have to run them by Cassidy?
why all this interest in Cassidy?
I just want to get a sense of your life.
Oh. - I don't like him.
he didn't want me to date you at first, and he didn't exactly threaten me, but we got pretty close to Don Corleone territory.
the guy creeps me out. - How weird.
Kyle, I know tonight didn't work out the way we'd hoped.
we all want the best for Jessi.
but clearly, she's a very troubled girl.
and you've spent an excessive amount of time being her anchor.
that has got to be draing.
she's my friend.
I'd do anything for her.
you're a good man.
I just don't want her instability jeopardize your future.
we never had a chance to talk about that... - I'd still like to.
maybe we can meet later.
that would be wonderful.
the Rack?
half an hour?
sounds like a plan.
OK, the coast is clear.
I always pictured the fairy-tale ending to the perfect date as me climbing through your sister's window.
I wish I could beat you up to maintain the theme of our evening.
anyway, let's move.
Yes, sir.
he's coming.
dad!
Hey. How's it going? - Hey.
is Star Trek Night over already?
what happened? Did you get mopey again?
no, it was great. You were right.
Andi loved the whole super-galactic send-off. Genius idea.
then why...?
let me explain.
Josh, I can't believe you...
look so tired.
I'll go tell your mother that you're home and that you're going straight to bed.
to sleep.
so this is it.
my domain.
Wow. You must study a lot.
there's always someone studying more.
why do you make everything a competion?
Wow. Direct.
sorry.
no, I think I need that.
you should call me on my stuff. It's good.
can I get you anything?
I could use a soda.
machine's right downstairs.
no Belly Button
your beverage, milady.
thank you.
you OK?
fine.
Hello?
is anyone here?
Jessi. Where is everyone?
we closed early.
I don't know what it is you want.
the truth.
I know you killed Sarah.
Why?
Sarah left.
I'm sorry she couldn't handle being your mother.
don't you dare speak of her that way.
she didn't leave me, you killed her.
you need help.
actually, I think you do.
see what's happening to the water?
I can do that to you.
I can manipulate the blood flow in your body.
what? - I can target certain areas and make the vessels expand and contract.
Jessi, listen... - Why did she have to die?
I suggest that you answer me.
you don't want to accept that Sarah left.
I had nothing to do with it!
what are you doing?
stop! Don't!
you need to calm down.
he murdered my mother!
stay out of it.
it didn't happen that way.
what are you saying?
you want the truth?
Sarah attacked me.
what? - She saw me that night!
she knew I was Latnok.
she was gonna kill me.
she lost it!
I was protecting myself. I had no choice.
you're lying.
I can tell that you're lying.
it makes no sense.
Jessi! You need to tell her what's going on.
Baylin's experiment.
prolonged gestation in a pod.
we're starting it up again.
the experiment.
why would you do that?
I'm looking at the reason.
you're a success.
Sarah found out.
she didn't approve.
so you killed her!
you took everything from me!
my mother! And now Kyle!
Jessi! Jessi, don't!
you know what I did. You can't even look at me anymore.
that's not true.
we can get through this.
no. It doesn't matter anymore.
I'm already a murder. - No!
Jessi. Speak to me.
Kyle, she's... - No, don't say it!
please. It didn't work.
Jessi, please! Breathe!
Kyle, I got nothing, man.
I got nothing.
come on, we gotta get out of here.
Oh, my God.
we gotta get out of here. - I won't leave her.
Kyle, you can't be here.
you can't be here, man.
Jessi, I'm sorry.
they're gone.
are you all right?
I slowed my heartbeat down to two beats per minute.
and it was strangely relaxing.
you better go.
Nicole's waiting for you at home.
do you think we convinced Cassidy?
he'll send people to clean up the mess.
won't they tell him they didn't find my body?
don't worry. I'll take care of it.
I'm so happy you're home.
are you all right?
Oh, I'm fine.
Kyle explained the trick you were pulling on Cassidy.
I wish I'd known about it from the beginning.
we didn't want to worry you.
that part of your plan was unsuccessful.
Nicole, I'm really sorry I didn't tell you about what happened to me that night.
I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
and the way I reacted...
Jessi, you know you can always count on me.
I was just so surprised, hearing it like that.
that's why I decided to tell Kyle before.
when we were planning all this, he said, "No surprises."
and that was the one secret I never shared.
so I told him.
and he understood.
he always does.
so how did it go at The Rack?
just like we wanted.
I don't like that Kyle's still out there with Cassidy.
Kyle can handle him.
we had fooled Cassidy, and he revealed my biggest challenge:
Latnok was re-starting Adam's experiment.
I had to stop them.
I had to keep up the charade.
it was an accident.
you know that? - That doesn't change what happened.
she was gonna kill me.
you saved my life.
Kyle, I promise I will take care of this.
I will take care of you.
but you need to pull it together and go home.
tell them you met with me, but you never saw Jessi.
look at me. Look at me.
I'll make sure there is no trace of what happened.
this never happened.
as far as anyone's concerned, Jessi ran away and she's not coming back.
do you understand?
Yes.
we're in this together now, Kyle.
and together, there is nothing that we can't do.
but we need to trust each other.
I trust you.
do you trust me?
I hadn't had much experience lying.
do you trust me?
but when it was necessary...
I do.
it turned out I was good at it.
we'll start at the beginning.
einstein spent seven weeks longer in his mother's womb.
that's why he was smarter.
I worked years developing an artificial womb.
it was supported by a secret group known as Latnok.
when you first came here, everything in the world was new.
Adam created me, but you are my family.
I saw you kissing Jessi.
it just wouldn't be appropriate.
it won't happen again.
