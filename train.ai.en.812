no.
was it there when you got back with the deer?
Yes.
then stop worrying!
there was smoke and you both dealt with it, and then he went hunting.
why is my mind shutting it out?
Robin, we will go back, as soon as we've warned the ship.
we can't turn around now.
the ship!
come.
they've already sailed.
no, they'll be behind the cliffs.
if I fire a shot
we left in a hurry.
you're not yourself.
we'll get there in time.
come on!
no, no, no!
we have to go the long way around.
along the cliff.
that way's a sheer drop.
there's a path to the beach from the cliff with the flag pole
you have a fever.
I've seen this.
I told you.
no.
from the cliff.
a boat from my ship, the triton.
other survivors?
I knew these men.
he's the captain of the triton.
this was his mark.
he was to sail to guinea, but I persuaded him to go to england instead.
looks like a mining cave.
it's gun powder!
he must've been using it to blast the quartz out of the rock.
but to what purpose?
it looks like this cave has a newcomer.
leopard.
find something to dig a grave with.
uh, leopard!
it can smell you from miles away, climb up the very tree that you're trying to hide in.
let's go.
he buries his colleagues and then dies alone, staring at an empty horizon.
at my worst of times, another soul's been suffering, and only from a day away.
is a day any different to 1, 000 miles?
in england, I suffered.
I knew you must be alive, because I was hurting enough for us both.
we share each other's pain.
come on.
if it was a leopard that was following--- a leopard?
if it was
well, we can't go back.
friday could be in danger or
well, we'll bring men from the ship and search for him.
I have to get back.
and risk the ship setting sail?
and putting those good sailors' lives at risk?
but friday
you don't know for sure that he's hurt.
you don't know for sure that he's there.
you have to remember what happened.
try!
I asked about the deer and you remembered that.
think about that.
the deer.
slow that memory down.
slow it right down.
there's nothing.
this is a waste of time!
please, one more time.
remember the deer.
Why?
things may not be as they seem.
if you know something, if you know what's happening, or what's happened, please just tell me.
how can I know anything that isn't in your mind?
it's nugent.
he's alive!
he was at the tree house!
we have to get back!
wait! Stop! Robin!
then why did he attack us?
why now if he's been alive this whole time?
well, maybe he didn't know you.
you didn't know him.
Yes, he left me for dead.
he could've killed friday.
we would've seen his body.
then where has he taken him?
to the caves!
the caves at the south cliffs.
which is where we're going, isn't it?
the flag.
the south cliffs.
Yes, we've been going in the right direction the whole time.
It's--thank god that you've come back.
let's just hope that we're in time.
so what had he, your robinson crusoe?
how did his wealth compare to mine?
where are his diamonds?
they're nowhere!
they are not diamonds!
aye, they are. - It is just quartz!
No!
crusoe must've been soft.
crusoe was my brother.
well, I'm your brother now.
your brother, your father and your owner.
and your king.
you all right?
Mm -hmm.
Robin! Aah!
this isn't like me, robin.
this isn't me!
you must wish I hadn't come.
No!
in sickness and in health, for richer for poorer.
in mountains and forests and falling off paths.
that was the end, wasn't it?
it's all right.
it's just a graze.
hmm.
it's just down the valley now.
it's not far.
we'll get you to the ship and we'll find friday.
come.
there you are.
rest here.
here.
did you say a prayer for the man who stared at the horizon?
the man you buried?
whoever he was.
let me hear your prayer.
please.
father...
you alone saw his suffering.
you witnessed his pain and his despair.
Lord, please allow him into your kingdom, and let the love of your son be his salvation.
Amen.
we buried the flag.
find friday.
he can save you.
the flag never flew.
how could you see a flag that never flew?
the ship!
survive, robin.
No!
for us.
do not move, crusoe.
don't move!
he's watching me.
I thought you were dead!
how did you make it this far in your state?
it is not possible!
Shh! Don't move!
it is the smoke from the bomb that he threw into the tree house.
what we inhaled was toxic.
it attacks the mind and the body.
but he gave me this to drink, so that I could work.
drink it.
Ugh!
you did not crawl halfway across the island so that I could watch you die.
drink it!
that man is crazy!
he wants me to build him a palace!
Liege," it is king?
Yeah.
I see what you're doing!
I said "chop" was an order!
Yes.
Yes. Yes?
Yes, my liege.
kneel. Your head never higher than mine.
I need more medicine.
in order for me to work, I must be able to breathe.
you breathe when I say you breathe.
up!
look alive.
so then, what do you think of your proud tree house now?
your deckhand's cuddy.
this will be a palace built with your sweat and blood, decorated with jewels.
and here...
the skull of your friend crusoe, once the vultures have picked it clean.
now we lay out the grand design.
this will be my throne room.
here.
be careful!
Kneel!
now get up.
alive!
Friday!
what are you doing here?
you're not well enough to walk.
the medicine's working, and I'm getting you out of here.
is there anything to cut these?
if I had, would I still be chained?
I have nothing.
did you leave your weapons behind?
Yes.
along with half my blood and my mind.
so you saw susannah?
it is hallucination.
somehow you must've known that you'd find your way here, so you made her lead you.
she was so real!
if I had been your hallucination,
I'd have told you to bring an axe.
perhaps I can pick the lock with these.
kneel.
we are not your enemies.
Kneel!
if I might just speak
silence in court!
state your name.
state your name.
my liege!
you must address me as "my liege."
Robinson crusoe, my liege.
take the bible in your right hand.
your bridges bible?
with the family history written in it.
you took my bible!
you have no property.
you're a prisoner.
now swear to tell the truth.
swear it.
I swear to tell the truth...my liege.
the charges against you are theft of property.
one deer.
attempted theft of land...
land?
your flagpole on my cliff.
you intended to raise a flag and claim my island for yourself.
the flag was to guide a rescue.
your flag was a declaration of civil war, crusoe.
no, a rescue is coming.
I have sent word to england.
what would I want with rescue?
I listened to you once.
take me to england. Change your course."I need to get home.
never will I take orders from another man again.
you have the blood of two score sailors on your hands.
he did not cause the storm.
Silence!
or steered the ship!
may I speak, my liege?
No!
theft of property and land.
trespass... mutiny!
treason.
how do you plead?
who's were the bones?
who survived with you?
how do you plead?
did it bring you no relief to discover that we were here, that you were not alone?
how do you plead?
not guilty.
the bones were hadley seabrook.
the cook?
why didn't you give him a proper burial?
Dissident! Deserter!
why should I tend to his soul?
the court has considered your plea, but finds you guilty on every count.
and no, no part of me was pleased to discover that you lived.
rise.
by the power invested in me as monarch of these islands,
I sentence you to be hanged by the neck until dead.
more! More rope!
more!
less.
not so much less.
I know how to hang a man.
the weight, the height, the drop.
you think I don't know?
I know.
12 and a half stone!
I'm right, aren't I?
6"1." See?
I'm never wrong.
I always know by eye.
I'm faultless.
I'm faultless.
Where's my measure?
yard!
you are 2 yards and one inch on top.
you'll see I'm right.
surely if I was standing, you could measure me more accurately.
don't give me orders.
nobody instructs me.
stand.
stand!
you think I'm stupid.
could a stupid man rule this island?
could a stupid man amass my wealth, my diamonds?
no, no, no! Don't shoot him.
release me.
what are we going to do with him?
take him home, with us.
up, my liege, and keep walking.
don't touch that.
don't dare!
No!
he's different.
from what?
to you.
desperation can make a man forget himself.
Yes, but desperation does not make every man a killer.
how long will you keep him prisoner, fed, guarded?
my bible!
please! Please, friday!
keep walking, my liege!
keep walking.
I will not waste our food on you for long.
Hey.
if I had known you survived the triton,
I'd have found and killed you the same day.
would have been as pointless as digging into this rock.
the roof's coming in!
it will be your tomb!
you must get out now!
we have to get out!
I don't obey your orders.
leave it!
it's worthless!
you're not a king and they're not diamonds. They're just rocks.
no.
diamonds!
what use is this?
please, come with us.
I'm king of this island, crusoe!
I rule here!
come on!
and I judge you guilty!
there's blood on your hands and you'll pay!
you're guilty of murder and you'll pay for the blood on your hands!
you're dead, crusoe, and the sentence is death!
are you ok?
susannah is not there.
he's used the smoke on you again.
I have the medicine.
I thought you were dying.
I'm stronger than you imagine.
I imagine you in many ways.
I hope you survive without me.
sometimes I fear you survive too well.
I have to go.
I believe I will see this one day.
I would choose madness, if it meant that I could stay with you.
Shh!
it is a beautiful place.
it is.
Cribbage, cooking and counting seeds.
and don't hate the birds, robi when they fly away, send them with your love, and I'll look out for them.
please!
if you're so determined to choose death, at least dig your own grave.
stay strong.
thank you.
it's daniel's birthday today.
my son.
I don't even know if he's alive.
tell me is the flower dead or alive?
you cannot choose what is happening where you cannot see, but you can choose what you want to believe.
they're having a party.
Yes, yes!
they're raising a toast to you.
not to me.
to daniel.
then to me.
susannah and sophie are there in their new dresses.
and daniel shined his shoes.
and what of your friend, blackthorn?
Oh, he's there.
the party's in his drawing room.
and my father's there as well.
he pats his belly and he asks for another piece of cake.
that's 3 now.
Yes!
happy birthday, daniel.
Alice was your grandmother.
she died before you were born.
is father with her?
no, sophie!
your father's alive.
and wherever he is, he knows that it's your birthday!
and he's thinking about you.
move over prime time, because your favorite reality series is back.
the Boroughs Take Miami is celebrating its premiere today, and you're invited to the party.
yo, Gabe C. from Queens here.
what up, party people?
Yeah!
you know what they call the sixth borough?
Miami!
are you, like, a bodyguard for the cast?
no, no. I'm a cop.
here to do crowd control.
you guys usually do that?
on a day when we have five parades, yeah.
Hey, Miami, what's up?!
it's your girl Too-Shea here representing Brooklyn, that's right.
so, you can't, like, introduce me to Too-Shea?
no, can't help you. - You having fun?
listen, I got something y'all are gonna kiss my feet for.
my new tanning spray will be available in all your finest drug emporiums starting this month.
but y'all get a free sample!
Oh, I love you, too!
yo, yo, yo, Miami!
I wasn't even done yet. - What's up?!
she loves it, she loves it.
ladies do love me.
yo! It's your boy, Zachary "Guns" Rittner saying holla from The Bronx.
so, y'all remember to pick up some Gun Fire, my signature performance-enhancing dietary supplement, the next time you want to catch some prey.
possible gunshots fired, Hotel 220. Stand by.
welcome to the gun show, bitches.
Yeah! Yes.
false alarm. Fireworks.
Courtney's wasted... again.
all units, all units, person of interest heading towards the main stage.
he's got on a blue flannel shirt, blue flannel shirt.
keep an eye on him.
have another drink, Courtney.
Miami... Miami...
get down! Gun! Gun! Everybody down!
move! Move!
watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.
it is Eric Delko.
I need an ambulance and immediate backup to Hotel 220.
hotel 220.
she's dead.
listen, get up here.
stay with the body. Don't let anyone near her, you understand?
don't let anyone near her!
stay with the body!
watch out, watch out, move!
get out of the way!
move! Move! Move! Move!
coming through! Move! Move! Move! Move!
these parking lots can be active.
now get your hands in the air and get up.
slowly.
hands in the air.
you got the wrong guy.
is that a fact? Then why are you carrying that weapon?
it's not what you think.
it's a pellet gun, H.
it's just red paint.
well, what are the pellets for?
Courtney has a hair care line.
the pellets represent the blood of the animals that Courtney used to test her hair care products with.
that sounds like motive.
no. I just wanted to send Courtney a message.
I didn't kill her.
I didn't even get a shot off.
well, you know what, my friend?
if I find out you're lying, the same won't be said of me.
reality got too real in Miami this morning for a star of the hit reality series The Boroughs.
cast member Courtney Alderman took a tumble that sources say might be fatal.
though police have yet to confirm the star's death, witnesses attending the show's season premiere party at Hotel 220 immediately tweeted about this celebration gone wrong.
I'm telling you, there are no secrets.
I mean, you live together in a hotel for three years, you get to know each other pretty well.
do you know this man?
EW, pasty, granola hippie.
so not my type.
Yeah, well, we think that, uh, he or the animal rights group he works with may have something to do with Courtney's death.
it was one of those activist stalkers.
Yeah, Courtney and me - we get, like, 20 hate letters a day.
some from stalkers with a cause.
some from just plain-old stalkers who wanted to jump our bones.
Yeah, we're going to need to see those.
Oh, okay.
statue of Liberty, uh, booze luge.
makes you miss college.
Yeah, what you remember of it.
Yeah.
tell you what, I'm going to go check the footage.
if the cast didn't see who the killer was, maybe the cameras did.
here. These are the hate letters we got just from today.
I don't know what it is.
people just love to tell us they hate us.
I don't know.
the dude needs to beef up.
did you ever see him approach Courtney?
don't look like her type.
I mean, maybe if she was drunk.
and knowing Courtney, she probably was.
Fluoroscope's not picking up anything.
no pellets, no BFT, no lacerations, nothing.
no pellets. Well, that clears Wayne Bullock.
what if somebody took a shot at her during the fireworks display with a real gun?
have you got a through and through?
torso's clean.
all right. Let's go again. Hands on.
Hey, Tom. She's got blood in her ear.
inconsistent with blunt-force trauma from the fall.
only a millimeter in diameter.
and yet...
...the tympanic membrane's torn.
shredded her internal auditory canal.
her balance was gone. That's why she fell.
the fall isn't what killed her.
Courtney suffered a stab wound that penetrated her ear and didn't stop until it hit her brain stem.
an injury this severe, she would have been dead within a minute.
so she was stabbed near where she fell.
a regular knife wouldn't do that, would it?
it would need to be something specific to navigate the ear canal and penetrate the gray matter?
you're looking for a unique blade.
four inches long, and only several millimeters wide.
great. I know exactly where to start. Thanks.
to Courtney.
Hey, people, Miami-Dade Police Department. The party's over.
Shea Williamson, Zachary Rittner, Gabe Calligan, you're coming with us.
let's go. Come on.
what is all this about?
this is about finding the murder weapon that killed your friend.
hands up.
watch your hands.
what are you looking for?
geez, you don't have to paw-rape me.
I'm not paw-raping you, I'm just searching you.
why would I kill Courtney?
we've seen the footage from the show, and it's clear you've had problems in the past, Gabe.
I did not hook up with Too-Shea's sister.
you know what, fine. Lie about it. It doesn't matter to me, okay?
Shea's the one that's gonna be pissed.
enough.
if Courtney's gonna accuse me of lying, she needs to realize that I will eventually shut her up.
this is my pocketknife.
just your pocketknife, yet slim enough to match the wound in Courtney's brain.
so witnesses confirm that Courtney was in the green room before she fell.
so?
so the cast were the only ones with access to the green room.
that makes you guys the prime suspects.
hold up.
Courtney was my friend.
not in The Boroughs, she wasn't.
Courtney, sweetie, you have to stop guys after I do.
we just went to dinner.
you think I've been naughty?
what do you think, this is some ploy for the cameras?
your friend Courtney was stabbed to death.
so you mean shot?
by, like, that activist stalker with a gun?
no, I mean stabbed.
by something sharp.
like a nail file.
do you think one of us killed her?
what I know is that you were all the last people to see her alive.
and according to the show, you all had motive.
booty call!
guns, not tonight, okay?
it was some freaking nobody she met at the bar.
Courtney can hook up with whoever she wants.
I hope she catches that herpes virus thing and croaks.
yo, the show has nothing to do with actuality.
Yeah, well, you know what, Courtney was actually murdered, and you are all actually suspects.
you understand that?
I told you, you wouldn't find nothing on me.
can I have my cell phone back so I can go now?
no. Let me look at your jacket.
no, I told you I wasn't sporting no murder weapon.
come on!
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
you sure know a lot about our show.
what are you? A fan?
no, I'm a police officer.
I do my homework.
we're coming to you live now from Miami-Dade Police Department, where cast members of The Boroughs ...
representatives for the remaining cast No charges have been filed "Hi" in the stabbing death of Courtney Alderman.
fans of the hit series are insistent that the show must go on.
so we luminoled everything they had on them, from the pocketknife to the nail file.
there's not a drop of blood on any of them.
Yeah, you, too. - No...
they're mugging it up for the cameras the same day their friend dies.
at least they're not letting murder get to their heads.
hang on. Who's this?
Eric! Arrest him!
what's your problem? Get him, get him!
Mr. Calligan, are you okay? Look at me. Mr. Calligan?
hello there, Dan Wilson.
why did you hit that kid back there, huh?
it's complicated.
Oh, yeah? You want to explain to us why?
I'm done talking.
okay. I got him. For now. Let's go.
Mr. Calligan, look at me. Who would do that to you? Did you know that man?
I don't know.
first Courtney, now me.
what is going on?
why Gabe Calligan?
what about Courtney Alderman? Did you stab her, too?
who? No.
you shouldn't be talking to me; I'm not the killer here.
well, you did attack Gabe Calligan, and that's aggravated assault.
Mr. Wilson, I need a reason not to send you to jail right now.
what did he do to you?
he tried to kill my baby brother.
how?
Tyler, my brother, snuck into a club last night.
he's been acting out.
my mom died last year, and since then, I'm all he's got.
he texted his best friend from the club.
said he'd bought drugs from Gabe Calligan, the famous kid from The Boroughs.
only, they were bad drugs.
how do you know they were bad?
Tyler ODed.
he's on life support at Dade General right now.
you sure it was him?
I'm positive.
I just can't prove it.
Tyler - they don't think he'll make it.
what do you think?
not good, Lieutenant. We haven't been able to identify the drug in his system.
what about symptoms?
they're all across the board: dangerously low levels of sodium and potassium;
constriction of the blood vessels...
this is unlike anything we've seen before.
and until I know exactly what we're dealing with, I can't treat him.
the wrong therapy could kill him.
how much time do you give him?
hours.
we need to know what he took, and fast.
I'll get you an answer.
so here's what we know.
Courtney was stabbed through the ear with an unknown murder weapon.
and uniforms tossed the green room and came up with squat.
so, apparently, our murder weapon just vanished into thin air.
all right, let's just say for the sake of argument that it wasn't a fellow cast member.
well, we also know that the witnesses said that there were no producers and no crew in the green room before she fell.
true, but we traced all the letters that Shea gave us...
here are the people that we know were busted for stalking the cast in the last year.
that girl is in prison.
and that dude... - That's a woman.
...is in Latvia.
right, so no one was even remotely near Miami.
okay, well, maybe this was personal.
maybe we should be looking into her past.
the show gave Courtney a fake identity, but we got a warrant for her real Social Security number.
get anything from it?
sure did.
Courtney's real name is Megan Rauch.
she was born and raised in Darien, Connecticut.
What?! Really? Thought she was from a borough.
apparently not.
she was homecoming queen, captain of the field hockey team, president of the drama club.
she has a squeaky clean record.
Really? Because on the show, she's disorderly every other second.
maybe it was an act.
maybe she was hiding who she really was.
well, that's not all she's hiding.
so I found myself going through the footage of the show.
don't you mean avidly catching up on the season?
maybe that, too.
I found something kind of interesting, though. Take a look at this.
yo, listen, if I impregnated you, you'd have twins.
you cannot tell anybody.
tell anyone you did what,
come on, it hasn't happened for months.
holy! You two guys hooked up?!
you're dreaming, Shea. It never happened.
Yeah, me and Court, man?
no way!
this is good.
I mean, I would keep that a secret, too, if I'd hooked up with that roilded-out freak.
Yeah, point taken, but, uh, look at the freeze frame.
look what she's holding.
her stomach?
maybe she was sick from partying all night.
I don't think so.
maybe she was pregnant.
thank you.
she is holding her belly like an expectant mother.
Hey, Tom, is there any chance our victim was pregnant?
this is good.
she really was knocked up?
how long after you started sleeping together did you find out?
well, no, we never did that.
we all just watched the same footage. I don't think that there's any point in lying.
yo, Guns ain't a liar!
all right, Zachary, you've got two girls who know a lot about Guns.
you can sit down.
look, Courtney's blood tested positive for HCG, so we know she was pregnant when she died.
all we have to do is run a paternity test on you, and then we could book you for murder.
did you kill Courtney and the baby because you thought they might cramp your style?
you're a good-looking guy.
I'm sure the ladies like you. Did you think they wouldn't like you if you had a baby?
all right, look.
that was all an act.
a setup for the cameras; it wasn't real.
all right? Look... Courtney and I never hooked up.
in fact...
I've never slept with anyone.
I'm sorry.
do you expect us to believe that you're a virgin?
I mean, if that's true, why would you get buff? What's with all the buff?
to quote from Corinthians, chapter six, verse 19, "Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you.
is this guy for real?
look, this is the real me.
Zachary Rittner, seminary student... and future priest.
then who is "Guns"? Who is that?
I don't know. A made-up character.
the producers of The Boroughs, they saw me on a beach in L. A. and they liked my look, so they offered me a part in the show.
said I could play the part of "Guns."
look, I know what you're thinking:
why would a future priest take such an immoral job?
what better way to reach out to sinners?
and the money goes straight to the Church.
you never slept with Courtney?
and I will gladly give a DNA sample to prove it.
that baby wasn't mine.
yo, Wolfe!
so, I went through Courtney's phone records and found one incoming Connecticut number that popped up more than any other, a guy named James Reed.
but there's no mention of him in her file.
can we track his cell phone, see if he's in Miami?
way ahead of you. Reed's at Hotel 220.
been registered there for the past two months.
two months?! - How did we miss this guy?
guy's been hiding in plain sight, in a room directly across from Courtney's.
Oh, great, we've got another stalker.
I know. I already brought him in.
so, you were stalking Courtney Alderman.
look, we know that you came to Miami the same day she did.
we know you requested the hotel room across from hers.
I wasn't stalking her!
you don't need to lie to us.
I'm not!
then why were you following her every single move?
you want to explain that?
because she was my wife.
look, Courtney's contract required that we keep the marriage a secret.
what about the baby?
we agreed that she was gonna quit the show and go back to Connecticut.
all right, look, Mr. Reed, we searched your hotel room.
we found a broken lamp, we found a broken vase by the bathroom.
you know what that looks like to me?
signs of a struggle.
that looks like you two didn't have, I don't know, very happy discussion?
look, I'll admit it.
I reacted badly when Courtney told me she was pregnant.
is it even mine?
you know you're the only one I've been with!
everything else is just editing!
is it?
I thought you were gonna be happy!
I thought you wanted to start a family and make a new life with me!
baby, calm down, okay? Baby, calm down.
once we cooled off, we agreed she'd leave the show and start a new life together.
you do realize how bad this looks?
you and Courtney had an argument the same day she was murdered.
and you never stepped forward as her husband.
look, I was a mess, man!
I didn't know what to do.
but I did not kill my wife and baby!
I loved them!
so, you gave this kid poison?
but I didn't.
what do you mean, you didn't?
he ODed on drugs that you sold him last night at a club.
he dies, that's on you.
Mr. Calligan, I need you to stop lying to us or getting punched in the face will have been the best part of your day.
look, I got no talent, no shit, no nothing.
all I have is my fame.
I just wanted my own thing.
what, so your thing is selling drugs?
what's in the drug?
she said it was ecstasy.
who's she? Your supplier?
look, I know what happens to a rat, okay? I'm not stupid.
listen to me.
you don't talk, people are gonna think you did anyway.
least if you do, we can get the D. A. to drop the charges.
you're looking at 15 years, so...
what's her name?
what is her name?
her name's Hannah Beckstrom.
I'll track her down. - Okay.
is he gonna die?
you better hope not.
Hey, so do you believe that Courtney's husband would really kill his own unborn child?
look at Scott Peterson.
and you know that they say that murder is one of the top causes for death among pregnant women?
Yeah.
that's awful.
we know Courtney was stabbed here in the green room.
maybe this was a crime of opportunity.
then the easiest way to get rid of the murder weapon would be to drop it.
it has to be here. No way it just disappeared.
Hey, Lady Liberty.
you know why the real one's green?
no, but I bet you're gonna tell me.
she's green because she's made of copper.
so the oxidation process causes a green patina to form.
did you moonlight as a tour guide?
I spent some time in New York.
I took the tour... and I learned that her crown has seven spikes for the seven seas.
but there's also another spike that not many people know about.
wanna know where it is?
please tell me where it is,'cause you are killing me.
bottom of the torch.
check it out.
uh, no. - No?
no. That spike is not there.
what do you mean, no?
I... I saw it.
I took the tour. It's supposed to... Well, okay, it's not there.
I mean, in your defense, it looks like somebody broke it off, like it's missing.
see?
wait a minute. How big would that be?
would that be about four inches long and a few millimeters wide?
small enough yet sharp enough to penetrate the ear.
no wonder we couldn't find the murder weapon.
you were right. It didn't just disappear.
it melted. - It melted.
a murder weapon with a guaranteed expiration date.
okay, but even if the murder weapon did melt, the sculpture itself might be able to lead us to our killer, so we really should take this in.
Yeah, but how do we stop it from melting?
find out if the hotel has a freezer truck.
look, I'm double parked. I better not get a ticket.
you guys totally dragged me in here.
miss Beckstrom, parking tickets are the least of your problems right now.
that's a nice bag.
bet you paid about two grand for that?
I think we know where you got the money.
you sold drugs to this man last night at Club Rev, right?
that guy from that reality show?
you gotta be kidding me. I do not sell drugs.
but you used to.
that's right. You got a few priors for possession with intent to sell.
Hannah, a boy is dying in the hospital as we speak.
I need to know what you sold to Gabe Calligan.
I just told you, I didn't sell him anything.
so, what, did you move from selling to manufacturing?
this is ridiculous.
I don't have anything to tell you.
and actually, I don't have to.
Hannah... if I were you, I'd sit down.
now open your bag and dump the contents on that table.
do it.
Yep, it's marijuana.
at least 28 grams here. That's a felony, right, H?
Hannah, look at me.
what is in the drug?
I don't know.
it's not like I make it or anything.
I don't do anything big like that... - Okay, who does?
who makes it?
we meet at the same place every time, but a different guy sells to me each week.
what is the location?
ten years in a penitentiary.
so...
what's the location?
yeah?
get up, Arthur.
I have a teenage boy dying in the hospital because of a drug deal that happened in this restaurant.
we need names of all your patrons.
please. I don't keep names.
and I can't control who does business here.
what about credit card receipts?
we're cash only.
this is a family business started by my father. He didn't believe in credit.
just honest work.
this is not going anywhere.
not necessarily, Frank.
you know what, Arthur?
I'm gonna guess and say you manufacture the pills here on the premises.
what pills?
I don't know anything about any pills.
Really?
it's 92 degrees outside... ...and you're sweating like a pig.
why is your air conditioning off?
the A/C trips the fuse.
I turn it off when I'm cooking.
Yeah, but you're not cooking food here, are you?
get your hands on your head right now.
got a warrant for that?
Arthur, this is my warrant.
he's bradying down.
we need another ABG.
come on, kid.
doctor, here it is.
we need to rush.
we're gonna have to narrow down what he took.
starting the analysis now.
wait! V-fib! Starting compressions.
we need the crash cart and I. V.
come on, hurry up! We're losing him!
charge at 200.
clear.
no response. Again.
negative for cocaine and benzodiazepine.
no match in the opiate family.
charged at 300.
clear!
positive for a schedule one controlled substance:
GHB.
wait, it's also registering positive for an unscheduled substance.
we need to run it through the database.
it's methadone.
we got it. We need eserine and diazepam, start!
doctor, we got it.
got it.
starting I - Charge at 400. Clear! - Clear!
you're gonna be fine.
I know.
it's gonna be okay.
guess I should've worn a parka, huh?
Yeah.
but the quicker we find out who handled the murder weapon, the less we have to freeze.
I don't see anything.
there's no trace where the killer broke off the spike.
Yeah, I don't have any prints, either.
this thing's been melting this whole time, so any evidence probably slid right off.
what if it slid down?
maybe trace from the spike flowed to the ice at the base of the statue.
wait a second... Get a little bit closer...
Yeah, right there.
see that sparkly substance?
I recognize those particles.
- I think that's DHA.
what do you have, X - ray eyes?
no, no, it's just, it's the main ingredient in spray tanner.
and how would you know about that?
I have a lot of friends who work around the clock, and, uh, still manage to keep those perfect Miami tans.
just like someone else I know.
roll tape, and action.
Zachary, come on... Courtney would have wanted us to do this.
I don't think she would, since you killed her.
Shea Williamson, you're under arrest for the murder of Courtney Alderman.
give me a break with this.
I didn't kill nobody.
we found evidence of you on the Statue of Liberty ice sculpture.
we know you used it as the murder weapon.
get outta here.
get outta here, like, now!
you can't prove anything.
everything must be all melted by now.
the murder weapon may have melted, but you left behind your signature tanning spray.
are you guys, like, seriously arresting me right now?
you know what, Shea? Drop the act. Drop the accent.
we know who you really are, Elizabeth.
we know you have a very impressive degree from MIT - chemical engineering.
that fancy degree came with a quarter-mil of debt.
Courtney was messing with my livelihood.
you can't leave the show.
we can't do The Boroughs without you.
some things are more important than the show.
Oh, really?
what's more important than the paychecks?
I'm guessing you would've made enough money to pay back your student loans by now.
and then some.
before the show, I had papers published, my peers respected me, and I spent every Saturday night at home, alone.
so, I mean, are you telling us that you went on The Boroughs just to get a social life?
I never want to be Elizabeth again.
and as long as the show airs, I don't have to be.
so you thought that if you killed Courtney, you would save the show.
you don't just walk away from an opportunity like this.
what opportunity?
another year of partying and puking?
time to grow up, okay? I want to start my life.
what about the rest of us?
I'm sorry, Shea, you're not my problem.
I just didn't want it all to end.
you're under arrest.
turn around.
let me ask you something: Is this real enough for you?
we'll make sure to keep you updated, okay?
thank you.
so the doctor said Tyler took something called methadone, cut with GHB, a stimulant and a depressant.
and if you hadn't found out what the hell he took, Lieutenant, my little brother would've been dead.
we got lucky, didn't we?
can I see him?
go ahead.
Thanks. - Yeah.
Oh my god.
what was with all the short guys?
he was like, five feet tall.
I know, he came up to... there.
there's not a decent guy in there.
the one who kept grabbing my ass - total reject from the Jersey Shore.
at least he wasn't dragging around an oxygen tank.
see the way he's looking at her?
it's like she's the only girl in the world.
I want that.
where are all the good men?
smell that?
alcohol.
maybe this guy had a few too many and fell off his balcony.
well, the back of his skull is completely obliterated.
unfortunately, that won't help us determine how far he fell.
these injuries could have occurred if he fell five stories or 20.
it all happened so fast.
it's like the guy just fell out of the sky.
what are you looking at?
Oh, I'm sorry. You got something in your, uh...
I do?
Yeah, it's okay. Don't move.
what is it?
just a little piece of brains.
you always said you were looking for a guy with brains.
I'm sorry.
I make jokes when I'm nervous.
that's all right. Just a couple more questions.
did you girls hear anything before he hit the ground? Any yelling? Screaming?
no. I was just looking for a nice guy.
one with a pulse.
maybe a badge?
Sorry...I flirt when I'm nervous, too.
thank you.
victim is Brad Malone; guest at the hotel.
bad couple of days. He was down over 100 grand.
another $50, 000 in unpaid markers.
you got all of that for a hug?
Jerry? He used to work for my father.
so he just handed over the casino's financials?
come on. How well do you know this guy?
it's really not what you're thinking.
when Sam died, he... left me a little piece of the Eclipse.
how little?
it's really no big deal.
then why haven't you said anything?
I don't want everyone to know.
so now I'm "everyone"?
let's just... talk about this some other time.
victim is Brad Malone. He was in suite 730.
lost his shirt at the casino.
and apparently his pants.
it could be a jumper.
Vegas is the suicide capital of America.
come to gamble, see a show, kiss your life goodbye.
jumper's name's Brad Malone.
checked in four days ago.
divorced twice. No kids.
and he was about to file for bankruptcy.
not a lot to live for.
clothes neatly folded.
phone and wallet on the nightstand.
everything in its place. - Consistent with suicide.
you get your life in order before you end it.
there's no suicide note.
Nah. They don't typically leave one.
got a few recent e-mails.
past due notices.
offerings of joy?
no. No signs of sexual activity.
looks like he spent his last night alone.
door's locked.
latching mechanism only operates from the inside.
if he jumped off his balcony, how'd he lock the door behind him?
well, maybe he didn't jump, maybe he was pushed.
which means... he wasn't alone.
I'll check it for prints. - Yeah.
we got a print.
okay, we have a double homicide.
landlord identified the bodies as Lance and Denise Irwin.
on four months ago, so they had to move here.
talk about a step down. - Yeah.
who called it in? - She did.
the 911 operator said all she could get out was,"Help me, help me."
and then there was no response.
no blood on the phone.
lots of cast-off, though. On the couch, the lamp, the ceiling...
did you see what happened?
if you tell us, I'll give you a cracker.
well, if he did see anything, he's not talking.
so we contacted Animal Control for the parrot.
you know, it's a first floor unit.
the window was open, the screen was ripped, so that's probably how the killer got in.
Where's the husband?
the husband is in the bathroom.
what's going on? They dead?
can somebody get this guy out of here? Take his information?
we'll be with you in a minute, sir.
slight discoloration of his extremities.
lividity is just setting in.
the Irwins were killed less than an hour ago.
can't tell if he was stabbed, too.
nasty head wound, though.
possible broken nose, too.
so, Mr. Irwin was probably getting ready to go to work.
he works the 7: 00 a. m. shift at the gas station at the corner.
looks like Mrs. Irwin was making him breakfast.
an omelette. Maybe a frittata.
Oh, how Continental. Lucky guy.
check out the family photo.
matching outfits.
there is something very wrong with that.
what? That is a nice family photo.
still wrong.
I don't see the cat.
probably took off.
okay, so the killer came through the window and surprised Mrs. Irwin, right?
goes to take care of him.
Hey, uh, guys?
cash and credit cards are still here.
you know, come to think of it, parrots like these are worth thousands of dollars.
more, if they can talk.
I don't think this is a robbery.
well, maybe they were targeted.
I'll go talk to the landlord. See if anybody had a problem with the Irwins.
Hey, David.
I am so sorry I'm late. It's been one of those days.
they're not going anywhere.
what is the deal with glass tables today?
the print on the balcony door belongs to Malone.
there's only one set of shoe prints out here.
size 10, same size as Mr. Malone.
if he was pushed from this balcony, there'd be evidence of his attacker out here and there doesn't appear to be any.
maybe he was pushed from somewhere else?
look where the body landed.
the body's not directly below this balcony.
it's under the one next door.
suite next door is registered to a Stacy Cano and a Dana Carlston, from Ohio.
no connection to the victim that we know of.
drop of blood.
LVPD! Open up!
got a blood trail.
here you go. Drink this.
thank you.
you've got some minor bruising, but no open wounds.
and it appears that the blood that you were both covered in doesn't belong to either of you.
who does it belong to then?
we were hoping you could tell us.
do you recognize this man?
no, I don't think so.
we think he might have been in your hotel room last night.
you don't remember?
we had a lot to drink.
everything's a little hazy.
do you think that this is his blood?
what happened to him?
he's dead.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna be sick again.
an officer's going to come by and take you both to the hospital, get you checked out.
but we're still going to need to ask you some more questions. Okay?
okay.
the victim suffered a fractured skull and intercranial bleed.
rendered him unconscious.
so the killer attacked him in the shower and smashed his head against the wall.
and he drowned. - Drowned?!
we didn't find any water in the tub.
you know, it's possible to drown in an inch of water.
victim was unconscious. Couldn't lift his head up.
drain was clogged. Water built up.
by the time you arrived, the water was gone.
but I found something else.
healed scars on his upper body.
could be from some past altercation.
guess Mr. Irwin had some enemies.
you are dead, you hear me?! You're dead!
you left that message on the Irwin's voice mail a couple days ago, Dwayne.
how do you know it was me?
how do I know it was you? You called from your home phone.
Yeah, that doesn't prove I made the call.
dude, it's your voice.
all right, look, Dwayne, you live next door to the Irwins.
your landlord says you threatened him several times.
you tried to get him evicted, right?
Yeah, I hated him all right, but I didn't kill him.
I thought about killing that bird, though.
it never shut up, squawking all day and night. - Hold on a minute.
you mean you threatened to kill your neighbors because the bird was making too much noise?
wasn't just the bird.
the Irwins were arguing all the time. Screaming, throwing things.
it was like Fight Club over there.
you call the cops?
no, they wanted to kill each other. Why not let 'em.
all right, where were you at 7: 00 this morning?
in my apartment.
your apartment? Alone?
not exactly.
not exactly? What does that mean?
I was having some pretty hot phone sex with Betsy.
okay, I'm going to have to verify that.
how do I get ahold of Betsy?
you got a credit card?
only cost you $4. 99 a minute.
you ladies had quite a party last night.
we were celebrating.
my divorce was finalized a week ago.
how long were you married?
seven years.
worked two jobs to send that son of a bitch to medical school.
and it turned out he was examining the anatomy of every girl in the class.
I was married to one of those.
then you know.
it's been the worst year of my life.
Oh, I just wanted to cut loose and have some fun.
Stacy, we found Brad Malone's fingerprints on your balcony.
he was staying in the room next to yours.
good-looking guy.
I mean, is it possible that you and Dana met him in the hall, invited him in for drinks?
I honestly - I wish I could remember.
we were pretty hammered.
were your drinks ever out of your sight?
maybe.
um, when I was dancing.
Wh-what's the last thing you remember about last night?
um, we were at a club...
which one? - I have no idea.
we made our way from one end of the Strip to the other,
I haven't had that much to drink since college.
my weekends are usually full of soccer and birthday parties.
not a lot of adult time.
do you recall meeting Brad Malone in one of the clubs you went to?
I told you I don't remember.
I'm just trying to understand how he ended up in your suite.
I'd like to know that, too.
um, well, Dana, your physical exams indicate that both you and Stacy engaged in sexual activity last night.
Oh, my God.
you're going to be okay.
I'm going to try to help you figure this out.
my husband and I, we fell in love when we were 16.
he's the only man I've ever been with.
alcohol affects the frontal lobe of the brain, which controls judgment.
makes people do things they wouldn't ordinarily do.
don't I know it.
one night in college, I drank so much, that I woke up the next morning on my front lawn with a box of corn flakes stuck to my head.
had no idea how it got there.
why am I not surprised.
college.
the frontal lobe of the brain also controls memory, which is why Dana and Stacy can't remember anything.
it's kind of hard to remember a complete stranger from a three-way in the middle of the night.
that's an odd place for an iron.
somebody got steamed.
positive for blood.
we smelled alcohol on our victim， which means he had been drinking.
we know the girls had been drinking. We know they were in this room having sex.
so somewhere during the evening, the party took a darker turn.
that's the problem with a menage a trois, is somebody always gets left out.
Yes, someone always gets jealous.
the question is, did one of those girls get so angry that she picked up that iron and used it as a weapon?
Stacy had just come off a bitter divorce.
maybe our victim said something, did something that reminded her of her ex.
she snapped.
killed him and then Dana helped her get rid of the evidence.
and what's that old saying?
a good friend will help you move.
a really good friend will help you move a body.
brass said the neighbor's alibi checked out.
the sex line confirmed that Dwayne's hands were full when the Irwins were killed.
well, he was also right about the Irwins' marital discord.
police were called out to their house at least once a month.
here are some of the 911 tapes.
911. What is your emergency?
help me, please! He's gonna kill me!
you call the cops, you stupid bitch?
thin line between love and hate.
did you run the prints from the apartment?
Yeah. They all came back to the Irwins.
I spoke with the landlord about the window.
turns out the screen's been broken for weeks.
apparently Mr. Irwin put his fist through it.
so maybe... there was no intruder.
I'm sick of you!
every single day, all you do is watch your stupid football...
fight her
got her blood all over him, so he takes a shower.
slips in her blood and drowns.
karma's a bitch.
if we're right, his prints will be on the knife, and her blood will be in the tub.
considering the damage to Brad Malone's skull, I can't tell you whether he was struck by an iron.
these cuts are from the glass table.
on the plus side, take a look at the abrasions on his buttocks and thighs.
that's linear clotting.
it means his blood was flowing when he hit the pavement.
these look like drag marks.
I pulled glass and some interesting trace from them.
these look like paint chips.
they're the same color as the railing at The Eclipse.
that's consistent with being pushed over backwards.
Mr. Malone's last night wasn't all bad.
I did a penile swab and found vaginal secretions.
he had sex close to time of death.
that's odd. We found a used condom in the women's hotel room.
parallel linear scrapes with parabolic edges.
well, maybe Mr. Malone got a little too aggressive with the second woman.
didn't want to use a condom.
she struck him in the back of the head with the iron.
that didn't stop him.
so maybe one of them or both of them pushed him off the balcony.
in my fantasies, a three-way never ends in death.
this sheet...
Brad Malone's pants and the iron.
all this blood came from the same person.
Nope. Unknown male.
you're saying there was a second man in the room?
I'm saying that three-way was a four-way.
what is he still doing here?
what happened to Animal Control?
they must have forgotten about him.
we should bring him back to the lab, hmm?
you hungry, buddy?
what's the point of having a parrot if he doesn't talk?
well, he might be traumatized.
he was living in an abusive household.
he witnessed Dad kill Mom.
now if we could only prove it.
none of her blood was in the bathroom.
doc Robbins said the tub might have had a clogged drain.
hopefully, some of her blood got stuck in the trap when Mr. Irwin took a shower.
Yeah, I'm on it.
you know, this would be a lot easier if you just told us what happened.
I found hair and a bunch of feathers in the trap.
feathers? - Yeah.
guess they didn't just dress him up, but they gave him showers, too.
looks like blood on the feathers.
hopefully, it belongs to Mrs. Irwin.
what are you doing?
well, these blood drops weren't here before.
our crime scene's been contaminated.
what? The door was sealed.
they're paw prints.
guess the Cat in the Hat came back.
or he's been hiding here this whole time.
I found him.
well, you're evidence now, buddy. You're coming back to the lab, too.
come here. Come here, kitty.
come on, buddy.
you're telling me those ladies from Ohio had two men in their room? - Yeah.
one guy ends up dead, and the other one's blood is all over the bedroom.
that must have been some orgy.
actually, it was more of a one-on-one thing.
she never swapped partners.
we found a condom that contained DNA profiles of the newly divorced Stacy and the mystery man.
and Dana's SAE kit indicated that she had unprotected sex with Brad Malone.
and the women claim that they don't remember any of this?
come on. Give me a break.
give me a break.
do you know what it's like to wake up naked in a motel room with no memory of how you got there?
your head is throbbing. You're bruised, you're sore.
you've got no idea of what you did or what was done to you.
but you do?
well, yeah.
a couple of years ago, I... went with a friend to a John Mayer concert, and someone roofied my drink.
what? You were... you were raped?
no, thank God. I wasn't.
I... I thought I was.
but... I mean, even worse than that, was just having no memory of it.
there was just hours of my life gone.
not something I like to talk about.
Yeah, I'm getting used to that.
sorry to interrupt.
we just got back Dana and Stacy's tox report.
Stacy's alcohol level was 32.
that's the equivalent of 13 drinks.
we also found GHB in their systems.
so they were drugged.
Yeah, it was in their yard-longs.
but here's the kicker: Dana had trace amounts of GHB, but her blood alcohol level was only .07.
that's not even legally drunk.
look, I'm telling you, your soccer mom Dana remembers a lot more about last night than she's letting on.
someone drugged us?
is that why we don't remember anything?
well, that's why Stacy doesn't remember, but you were only slightly intoxicated.
not enough to cause memory loss.
Dana, you need to tell us the truth.
we know that Brad Malone wasn't the only man in your room last night.
who else was there?
I think his name was Kyle.
we never got his last name.
and where did you meet this Kyle?
at a bar.
I don't remember which one.
and how did he end up in your room?
Stacy invited him.
we emptied the minibar.
then Stacy wanted to dance, so... we blasted the stereo.
is that when Brad joined the party?
he knocked on our door. He told us to keep it down.
and Stacy invited him in for a drink.
and then... she and Kyle went into the bedroom.
leaving you alone with Brad.
well, we found your vaginal fluid and Brad's semen on the sofa, as well as the coffee table.
it seems like things got pretty crazy.
it... it wasn't like that.
he raped me!
I slept with one man my whole life.
you think I'm going to have unprotected sex with a total stranger?
I begged him to stop.
and because he raped you, you pushed him off the balcony?
I didn't push him.
then who did?
after Brad raped me... I went into the bedroom.
and Kyle grabbed me, and he... he pulled me down.
he said it was his turn.
all of a sudden, Brad was there.
Kyle flipped out.
he... he ran at Brad.
shoved him into the other room.
He-he-he just kept shoving him and shoving him and shoving him.
so Dana was raped, witnessed a murder, and then she went to bed as if nothing had happened?
Kyle said, if she told anyone, he'd come back and kill her.
she was scared.
well, was there any evidence of rape in her physical exam?
there was bruising, but it was inconclusive.
well, whatever happened in that hotel room, we know our mystery man Kyle was involved.
we need to find him.
David, you said you had something you wanted to show me.
Yes. This is from the bedding in the women's motel room.
take a look.
a feather? - Not just any feather.
it's premium quality, hand-harvested Hungarian goose down.
now, take a look at this feather that Nick found on the floor.
it's synthetic.
made fa ific bld of polyester fibers.
I managed to trace it to a manufacturer in China.
they supply low-end pillows to several motels in Vegas, but their biggest buyer is a bar called the Pillow Club.
Stacy and Dana said they went to a lot of clubs, a lot of bars last night.
now, I happen to know from personal experience that this particular club does sell the yard-long drinks, much like the ones that you found in the their suite.
maybe that's where they met Kyle.
but what does a club need with pillows?
so, half-naked people hitting each other with pillows.
an adult slumber party.
that's kinky.
well, you're already dressed for bed.
it sends a pretty clear message.
Yeah, add alcohol to the mix.
gives you permission to act out your aggressions.
no limits, no taboos.
excuse me.
what can I get you?
Yeah, we're from the crime lab.
we have reason to believe that these two women were in here drinking last night.
drinking a lot.
you know who might have served them?
it was my night off, but check at the bar.
our bartender, Kyle, he was working.
Thanks.
are you Kyle?
Yeah.
what happened to your head?
Oh, I hit it on the edge of the bar.
say what?
I said I hit it on the edge of the...
Damn! What the hell, man?
looks like you ran into an iron.
man, girl's lying.
about which part?
the attempted rape or the murder? - Both.
we know you had sex with Stacy Cano.
we also found GHB in her system. You're a bartender.
man, you had easy access.
Yeah, I gave her the drugs, but she asked for them.
said she wanted to party, lose control.
come on, Dana! You said that we were going to have fun.
drink it!
so Stacy thought we'd bring the party back to her room.
then, after you had sex with her, you thought you'd just have sex with Dana?
Hey, I offered to do her, but the bitch hit me in the head with an iron.
don't be like that, girl.
Damn! Come on!
wait.
Dana is the one who hit you in the head with the iron.
Yeah. She went mental.
chased me out in the hallway, screaming.
where was Brad Malone during all this?
you mean the hero boy next door?
he came out his room to see what the hell was going on.
get out!
are you okay, miss?
none of your damn business!
get the hell out of here!
so, you and Mr. Malone were never in the ladies' hotel room at the same time?
I got to the elevator to see Captain America taking Dana back to her room.
Where'd you go after that?
E. R. Took me four hours to get stitched back up.
you don't believe me, call Desert Palm.
I'll do that.
C.O.D. is exsanguination due to sharp force injury.
stabbed once.
only one stab wound?
you're kidding me, right?
there was castoff on the walls. I mean, her blood was everywhere.
none of the physical evidence in this case makes any sense.
only the Irwins' prints in their apartment.
only Mrs. Irwin's prints were on the knife.
only Mr. Irwin's blood was in the bathroom. - May-may-may I interject?
please.
I don't think Mr. Irwin killed his wife, though she was the victim of foul play.
see these scalp lacerations?
Yeah.
these are talon marks.
I heard the Irwins had a parrot.
if you are suggesting that the bird is a suspect, he was in his cage with the door closed when we arrived.
parrots are extremely smart.
you can teach them to do almost anything, even let themselves in and out of their cages.
well, yeah, it's true, but... there's no way that that bird picked up a knife and stabbed Mrs. Irwin.
right?
wh-what is with this family?
even the animals hate each other.
why didn't you just separate them, Hodges?
even though I project an aura of raw courage and unwavering self-confidence,
I suffer from...ornithophobia.
you're afraid of birds.
let's just say that I was terrorized by a flock of Canadian geese while visiting my uncle in Saskatchewan.
Really?
they were Canadian.
I thought they were friendly.
all right, well, according to Doc Robbins, the parrot attacked Mrs. Irwin.
we already know that the cat ran through the crime scene, so we're gonna have to process both of them.
I'll take the cat.
what is that?
what happened to you?
the castoff on the walls wasn't from the knife.
it was was from the parrot. He attacked Mrs. Irwin.
we found her DNA under his talons, and we found her blood under his feathers.
when he flapped his wings, it spattered blood on things.
the parrot killed Mrs. Irwin?
uh, well, he had an accomplice, the cat.
technically, he's responsible for Mr. Irwin's death.
so Sylvester and Tweety whacked their owners.
think of it as a series of unfortunate events.
what do you mean, don't think of it as a cartoon?
well, Hodges found traces of soap on the bird, and I found feathers in the bathtub.
Mr. Irwin was giving the parrot a shower when the cat attacked. - Okay.
Hodges also found plastic from the shower curtain under the cat's claws.
in his defense, you know, I think the cat was probably going after the bird.
the really hate each other.
the bathroom door was open, and the cat saw its opportunity.
now, Mrs. Irwin was in the kitchen making breakfast.
she must have heard the commotion. So, she went to check it out.
there were chopped vegetables on the counter so the knife was already in her hand.
and you know what they say about running with scissors.
the parrot was trying to get away from the cat.
and in his frenzied state, he turned his aggression on Mrs. Irwin.
the evidence strongly suggests that Mrs. Irwin, in then trying to get away from the bird, fell onto the coffee table.
she stabbed herself? - Yeah.
and then the cat went into hiding and the bird went back into its cage and shut the door.
remarkably, it all makes perfect sense.
there is one thing that we can't explain.
Mrs. Irwin had blood all over her hands.
how did she call 911 and not get any blood on the phone?
bartender's story checks out.
he was in the E. R. when Malone hit the pavement, so he didn't do it.
which means Dana lied.
Yeah, makes you wonder what else she's lying about.
like being raped.
well, if she wasn't attacked, why did she push Brad Malone off the balcony?
we know that she scratched him. His epithelials were under her nails.
Yeah, he's a big guy. Dana's about your size.
is it even possible for her to push him off that balcony?
it's possible.
check out my ass.
ray, your ass is a work of art.
but there's no paint on the backs of your thighs.
doesn't match Malone's injuries.
well, that would mean his thighs would have to have more contact with the rail when he went over.
the only way to replicate those kind of injuries is if he was sitting on the railing when he went over.
fresh coat of paint?
well, rape is all about power, but sitting on a balcony is not a position of power, so...
maybe Brad Malone wasn't the aggressor.
we know he and Dana had sex right before he died.
did that sex move out to the balcony?
well, we found a lot of partials on the railing.
we assume they were fingerprints. Maybe they were toe prints.
if they were toe prints, she would have been sitting in his lap.
have a seat, boss.
me?
well, I'm not getting up there.
come on, Catherine.
toes are under the bottom railing there.
got it? Okay.
yo, Ray, you're good.
Ecklie's not in the building, right?
seven stories up? Really?
isn't this a little Cirque de Soleil?
danger just adds to the excitement, Nicky.
suspended Congress.
what?
this position is called Suspended Congress in the Kama Sutra.
what? I'm a doctor.
this is my first three-way.
Really?
Yeah, I'm very excited.
okay, so things are heating up. They're really going at it.
it wouldn't take much for him to fall over now.
Yup. Paint right down the back of your thighs.
that's match to Brad Malone's injuries.
Brad's death was an accident.
he fell off the balcony while you were having consensual sex.
you did try to save him, which is why he had the scratches on his arm.
I have three amazing kids.
my husband is the love of my life.
not once in 15 years have I even looked at another man.
until Brad?
we had this immediate... connection.
I couldn't stop myself.
I lost control, and I'm not that person.
you have to understand, my husband and I only have sex twice a month.
lights out, under the covers.
well, you're not the first woman to have sex with a stranger... to have cheated on her husband.
a man died while I was having sex with him.
Incredible...mind-blowing sex.
Dana, you're not being charged.
you do have some explaining to do to your husband.
a bit of advice: The part about the mind-blowing sex...
I'd leave that part out.
case closed?
Yeah.
I know you're upset. You think I'm not being honest with you, but...
I just don't think couples need to tell each other everything.
so, who gets to draw that line?
you own a piece of a casino. That's a big thing to keep from me.
but, Lou, that's business.
that has nothing to do with us.
well, that says a lot.
I- I- I've had all the complicated relationships I could handle.
this is who I am.
please don't try to change me. I promise I won't try to change you.
so, what?
take it or leave it?
call me when you decide.
we found you a good home with a nice family.
no cats, and they have another bird.
this is your last chance.
you attack anyone else and your goose is cooked.
damn it.
you okay? - Yeah.
911. What is your emergency?
help me! Help me!
no blood on the phone.
you've been holding out on us.
you blind, lady? Express checkout, 15 items or less.
express
I'm sorry, how much is it?
Holly, please stop.
sweetie, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry...
what are you waiting for, morning? Just pay!
I'm gonna have to write a check. - Aw, come on! It's cash only!
turn that crap down!
well, I was needing to hit the grocery store this morning.
looks like someone had the same idea.
shots were fired, these two went down.
apparently, this whole thing started because of musical differences.
the smoker says the gangbangers did it.
there was a patrol car in the area.
they apprehended the gangbangers in the lot, searched the car, didn't find a gun.
now, the male victim-- his name is Hector Cortero.
he's been working here two weeks, and he's a cart collector.
prison tattoos. Shooting could be gang related.
Yeah, now, the female victim
we don't know who she is yet, but, uh, apparently, she's just an unlucky customer.
one bag of groceries, no purse, no keys, no cell phone in her pocket.
you know, this could be a robbery.
Bagger's prints are in the system, but according to AFIS, his real name is Hector Atoya.
he got a rap sheet? - Yeah, he did one year for a no-hit drive-by.
this could be retaliation.
second vic witnesses and becomes collateral damage.
Bagger's only hit once. She's hit three times.
two small-caliber gunshot wounds to the left chest, one to the right eye.
powder burns around the wound suggest that it was at close range.
looks like an execution.
which would make our soccer mom the primary target, but why?
Hey, this, uh, jerk over here just told me that our female vic had a kid.
a kid?! You get a description?
Yeah, little girl, about three years old; blonde hair.
Oh, and she had two bags of groceries.
she had a child and two bags of groceries.
I'm thinking she had a car.
we have a void. Maybe a tire crushed those pretzels.
she puts the child in first, gets one bag of groceries in the car and then...
bang. Killer jacks her ride, without knowing the kid's in the backseat.
Yeah, this is Brass. I'm down at the double 419 down at Honolulu.
we have a stolen vehicle with an abducted three-year-old blonde female.
we now have a 418/427.
amber Alert will be forthcoming.
you see these things, you hear about them, you never think you'll be involved.
so the victim was in your line?
and had you seen her in here before? Was she a regular?
Oh, no. Uh-uh, no. I never saw her before.
I've been working here a few years.
she had the cutest little kid with her, too.
she had too many items for the express line, but I don't think that was on purpose.
just, she seemed in a hurry and upset.
upset? How upset?
first, I thought it was just the guy behind her.
the "Express Line Nazi.
Yeah, yeah, we already talked to him, but you think she was upset about something else?
her hands were shaking.
the whole time, she seemed like she was about to cry.
Oh, and her cell phone rang.
Oh, it did? - Mm-hmm. She didn't answer it.
express line, so she, uh, she paid cash?
no. She didn't have enough.
I let her write a check.
Hey, Archie, it's Nick.
listen, I got a name and driver's license number - on our female victim. - Go.
Christine Moore. Nevada DL number 2266758771.
searching search results 2008 Dodge Caravan.
John-Henry- Victor-George-357.
anybody else on the registration?
next of kin, anything like that?
Daniel Moore. Probably her husband.
but registration's secured.
guy's got some kind of protected status.
well, that may be what got his wife killed.
Thanks.
huh. Looks like a . 22.
used to be the preferred caliber for mobsters and assassins.
nowadays they go for a Glock four-oh.
thank you, Ten Cent.
why don't you move him to Autopsy and try not to bust any rhymes on the way out.
I make no promises.
agent Moore, FBI.
uh, how can I help you?
looking for the female vic of the supermarket shooting.
she's in the washroom. But I... Hey.
whoa. Hold it right there.
agent Moore, FBI. - Yeah, congratulations.
nobody comes in here without my authorization.
Christine is my wife. - I'm sorry for your loss, but that's all the more reason for you not to be in here.
no one should ever see their loved one like this.
this is what I wanted to see-- her eye.
it's probably postmortem, if that's any consolation.
Oh, geez. Let me see that.
keep your hand elevated.
David, find the first aid kit!
hold this.
agent Moore. Captain Jim Brass. I came as soon as I could.
we have an AMBER Alert out on your daughter.
but I need you to keep it together.
can you give me a second? - Yeah. Hold it up.
now, I know this is tough, but when a wife is murdered, do you have an alibi for last night?
I was on a case. I can save you a lot of time.
I know who killed Christine. The name is Rylan Gauss.
and he has my daughter.
so I got an AG waiver on Christine Moore's missing cell phone.
she got a message five minutes before she was killed.
checker at the market said Christine received a call that she didn't answer.
that was from a Trent Moore.
guy sounds young. Maybe her son.
it's him, Christine.
it's Gauss. I've seen him.
he's following you and Holly! I-I don't know what to do!
he's going to kill us all, just like Dad said!
I'm gonna give you some temporary stitches in a little bit, but they won't hold long, so I would advise you to get an X-ray and some antibiotics.
Rylan Gauss is a federal case.
I don't know anything about it. What can you tell me about him?
he's a serial pedophile.
he steals the little girls right out of their beds.
the mother intervened on the last one. Gauss shot her in the eye.
Ah, just like, uh...
Yeah. - ...your wife.
I chased him for ten years.
six little girls. I never found any of them.
nothing to link him to any of the crimes.
I was able to nail him for the murder of the mother, though. 25-to-life.
how'd the guy get out of prison?
52 days ago, the conviction was overturned.
the appeals court tossed out the lead batch analysis that the Bureau used to link the murder bullet to Gauss' live ammo.
has he contacted you or threatened you?
me and my family.
given his M.O.my daughter doesn't have much time.
and I don't even want to think... All right, enough already, okay? We're done.
okay, take it easy. Thanks a lot, Doc. - Yeah.
is there anyone else that Gauss, uh, may be after?
I have a son from my first marriage.
what's his name? - Trent.
Hey, Trent, it's Dad. You call me back immediately.
Katie, it's Mr. Moore. Could I speak with Trent, please?
you sure he's not out on a delivery or...?
no, when you see him, you make him call me.
no, it's an emergency.
Trent didn't show up to work today. It's not like him.
let's go.
Las Vegas Police!
he has Trent. - If Gauss was here, he would've shot you coming through the door.
you got to ratchet it down a notch, okay?
control, this is Brass.
I need an APB out on Rylan Gauss, white male in his 30s, armed and dangerous.
bastard's got my whole family.
ready?
Rylan Gauss, Vegas PD! We got a warrant!
it's all clear.
we'll take it from here, boys. - Thank you.
if I was Gauss, out for revenge,
I'd kill Agent Moore's wife and his teenage son.
and take the little girl,'cause I get off on it.
Yeah. - Check the bed.
nothing but porno mags.
where else could he hide her?
let's tear the place apart.
looks like the point of entry.
there's some granular trace on the sill.
it's corn starch.
from cheap latex gloves.
that's Gauss' M.O. He always wears them.
guy comes in through the window, he jimmies it open with a chisel
that's what that mark is, right there.
agent Moore, with all due respect, you need to back off and let me do my job.
you're... overlaying my shoe impressions.
it's not going to be that hard to distinguish, okay?
Gauss wears a size 10, Nosumi soles.
agent Moore?
you are contaminating my crime scene.
Hey, buddy. We get it, okay?
the crime scene investigator is a professional.
she's working as fast as she can, all right?
well, I've seen it too many times, okay?
Cop-fast turns into hostage-late.
Hey, hey, back off! All right? Back off.
I'll take care of Gauss myself, then.
let him go, Mitch. Go ahead, get out of here.
looks like we got a pill dump.
people don't usually throw away narcotics unless they have to.
olanzapine and aripiprazole.
Trent Moore was on meds, antidepressants.
hmm. So Rylan Gauss flushed them?
it's a good way to control a hostage.
he could've kept a few, used them to force the kid's cooperation.
that's assuming that Trent Moore is still alive.
the agent who delivered these files said that Daniel Moore is the FBI's top pedophile hunter.
Ironic-- his own kids get snatched.
Yeah, well, not so ironic if one of the guys he's been chasing decided to turn the tables on him.
all right, the offender profile says that Rylan Gauss started in his early 20s, followed a typical escalation pattern
indecent exposure, couple of burglary charges.
social Services investigated an incident involving a female cousin.
four years old.
Gauss' parents wouldn't cooperate.
I hate it when the families protect these guys.
all right, well, let's look for anything about how long he usually kept the girls, or where he might have taken them.
Hey, Nicky. I got something.
it's a, uh...
clothes hanger made into some kind of a tool.
maybe for fishing something out of a tight space?
let me see that thing.
Yeah, there's something behind this panel.
if it's kiddy porn, we got him.
an Elephant Named Herman.
my Puppy Dog Tale, Kitty Cat Clues?
children's read-aloud books.
they never caught Gauss with any evidence from his victims.
personal items belonging to the missing girls disappeared just prior to their abductions, including children's books.
the items disappeared while the victims were playing in the park.
Gauss selects his victims from local parks.
that's where he does his shopping.
the Animal Fair. He didn't just go out and buy these.
looks like they got some years on 'em.
maybe the belonged to the victims.
they could be trophies.
print 'em.
this is Catherine. - Is there a park near your location?
Yeah, we passed one as we were driving into the neighborhood. Why?
Gauss doesn't keep his victims long.
and when he's done, he goes back out hunting in parks.
there he is right there.
what the hell is Agent Moore doing here? Gun!
agent Moore, put your gun down!
stand down!
get off me.
where is she?! - Where's who?
Where's Holly Moore? - I don't even know who that is!
fine. You're under arrest.
let go of me.
what's that about? - It's not illegal to make a video.
that-that's a cute little girl.
I wish I had one just like her.
what were you doing in the park, Rylan? On a play date?
after you were done with Holly Moore?
I spent five years in prison.
I like parks, open spaces.
I like to look at pretty things.
Where's Holly Moore?
is that any relation to a Daniel Moore?
come on. You know it is.
you threatened her whole family.
Oh, did you lose that sweet little girl of yours, Daniel?
I'm sorry.
Oh, but you have two children, so you still have one left, right?
Yeah, right. Let's talk about Trent Moore.
he certainly had a lot to say about you.
it's him, Christine. It's Gauss. I've seen him.
he's following you and Holly! I don't know what to do!
he-he's going to kill us all, just like Dad said!
no, no, no. No, that's a frame-up.
I went to prison for a crime I didn't commit.
it didn't work the first time, and he's trying to get me again.
he accused me of being a psycho. Me, a psycho?!
the guy stalks me my whole life! He's the sick one!
you hear that, Daniel?! You're the sick one!
so where were you last night?
Oh, last night? - Yeah.
um, I was in a...
a bar, the Red Lamp, off of Fremont.
the bartender's name was, um, Terry.
talked about how he needs a new head gasket for his car.
he'll remember the conversation. You just have to ask him.
feel pretty good about that, huh? What do you think?
you're just gonna waltz out of here, whistling a tune?
I went to the animal fair The birds and the beasts were there And the big baboon by the light of the moon Was combing his auburn...
hair.
I bet you know all the words to that, don't you?
Yeah, we found your stash of books, buddy.
and the lab guys are going over the prints right now.
and I'll tell you something.
if we find one print that matches up with any of those missing girls, that'll be your last walk in the park.
amber Alert picked up the Moore minivan.
car seat, no little girl.
the grocery store is across town, but we're walking distance to Gauss's place.
van's out of gas.
I have cookie crumbs on the car seat and half a juice box.
half a sandwich, egg salad.
from Cordon's Ranch Market, dated yesterday.
Christine Moore must have bought it.
how many three-year-olds do you know like egg salad?
I don't know any three-year-olds, but I do know that if Christine didn't eat it, and Holly didn't eat it, then whoever was driving this car must have. Right?
Gauss.
no match
ran the sandwich cellophane against Gauss's prints. No match.
whoever ate the sandwich took the girl.
if it wasn't Gauss, who was it?
the books we found in Gauss's apartment had no prints.
they're in no way a connection to any of these missing girls.
you gotta be kidding me. - No, sir, I'm not.
all we found were traces of cornstarch between the pages.
Yeah. Because Gauss wears latex gloves.
he sits there torturing these little girls while he's reading to them from their own favorite books.
I advise you not to leave town.
Oh, no, I'm not going anywhere.
just keep Mr. FBI away from me, or I'll have to get a restraining order.
uh, I hope your kids are all right, there, Danny.
you know, all that time wasted on me.
only have yourself to blame. Only yourself.
you're just going to let him go?
if we do anything now, it'll only come back to hurt us when we do try to nail him.
when is that going to be?
Jim! He just as much admitted that my kids are dead.
Hey, when I put him in prison, he's gonna stay there!
not going to get out on some technicality.
and by the way, his alibi checks out, you know.
not only with the bartender, but several patrons who he was drinking with all night.
Rylan Gauss didn't kill your wife!
he was in a bar.
Gauss is the only angle. You heard Trent's voice mail.
Gauss is stalking my family, and now you're just going to let him go.
Hey, file a complaint. I'll have him arrested.
are we on the same side here anymore?
is it just me, or does he not seem that broken up about his dead wife?
it's his focus; it's all about Gauss, even when the evidence points away from him.
you know, Nicky, I've known a lot of guys like Daniel Moore.
when things go bad, both professionally or personally, it's always the bastard that got away.
and Rylan Gauss makes one hell of a boogeyman.
I just got off the phone with Christine Moore's sister.
she called to arrange release of the body to a mortuary in Wichita.
isn't that usually up to the spouse?
unless the spouses are in the middle of an ugly divorce.
did Agent Moore mention that? - No, he left that out.
Yeah, that's what I figured. So I gave her my best Quincy, and she was more than happy to rat out her brother-in-law.
Christine was asking for sole custody of her daughter, and filing for guardianship of her stepson.
Guardianship?
Trent's 18. He's been living on his own.
Christine was going to court to prove that Moore was an unfit father.
according to her sister, the plan was to move both kids back to Kansas.
okay, well...
if Daniel Moore weren't FBI, we'd be looking at him for the murder of his wife.
Jim? I need you to verify the alibi for Daniel Moore.
good call, Cap.
agent Moore's car is parked around back. It's still warm.
Rylan Gauss's apartment is the last place this guy should be.
let's hope he didn't do anything stupid.
drop it. Now!
my gun hasn't been fired. You can check it.
I want your backup piece.
it's in the small of my back. I'm reaching now.
two fingers.
son of a bitch was down when I got here.
not that I didn't come here looking to kneecap him.
torture him until he told me where my kids are.
but unfortunately, someone beat me to it.
Yeah, right. Let's go.
the pills you collected from Trent Moore's bathroom floor are antidepressants, but they're also used in combination to treat emerging schizophrenia.
do we know if the kid had any psychological problems?
no, we don't. He was living alone, holding down a job.
not atypical.
when the disease becomes full-blown in adulthood, medications ramp up in proportion to the increase in delusions and paranoia.
agent Moore never mentioned that his son is schizophrenic.
he's got a bad habit of leaving things out.
I know we think Gauss killed Trent, but if he didn't, and Trent's been off his meds for the past 24 hours, then there's a good probability he's in the middle of a full-blown psychotic episode.
sandwich wrapper. - Trent likes egg salad.
which puts him in the van, when Christine and Holly came out of the supermarket.
he was probably there the whole time.
question is, what was he doing in the minivan with Christine and Holly, at 4: 00 a. m?
whatever the reason, he witnessed the shooting.
three GSWs to the torso. Small caliber.
same as the supermarket.
well, if Agent Moore shot Gauss, did he also shoot his wife?
they were going through a nasty divorce.
position of the body suggests he was hit as he entered.
agent Moore must've been lying in wait.
but how? Where's the . 22?
we didn't find it on him.
so why ditch a throw-away, and then come back and stand over the body with your service weapon out?
fast First Deliveries.
agent Moore's son works for a messenger service.
that wasn't here before.
74% of children who are abducted are dead within three hours.
it's been 24.
so the longer we sit here talking about what I didn't do, the less chance I have of ever seeing them again.
I know the numbers, all right? I want to talk about Trent.
your son is a clinically diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic.
my son, Trent, is fine.
he's just fine. What are you talking about?
we found psychotropic meds in his apartment.
now, clearly, he's under psychiatric treatment.
the meds just make you crazy.
I told Christine he didn't need to take them.
Oh, and this is based on what, your experience as a psychoanalyst?
don't push that angle on me.
you know the job.
we hunt down these scum who torture and rape children.
and you just got to suck it up.
cause there's no little pill that's just going to make this world a better place.
you know, your behavior has been erratic since I met you.
they say that mental illness runs in families.
everybody drinks the Kool-Aid, now
Christine, you,$200 shrinks.
well, not me. And not my son. We're the crazy people now?
my son and I are crazy, while Rylan Gauss is sane? Go to hell.
Gauss is dead.
you want to know what's really crazy?
we have evidence that Trent was in Gauss's apartment.
now, does your son have access to a small-caliber firearm, specifically, a . 22?
Gauss was killed with a . 22?
as was Christine, as was the bagger.
now, we're pulling slugs from the autopsy right now, and I think we're going to get a match.
Trent was with Christine, in the minivan, at the grocery store, at the time of the shooting.
now, what is Trent's relationship with his little sister Holly?
I refuse to believe this-- any of it!
well, let me tell you what I believe, okay?
Trent was not kidnapped.
he stopped taking his meds.
he's having a psychotic episode. He killed Gauss.
and as hard as this is to say, I think he killed Christine.
now the question is, would he harm his little sister Holly?
he loves Holly.
if Trent had Holly, where would he take her?
my first wife died of cancer when Trent was ten.
they were very close.
sometimes, he just likes to go back to the old house.
Where's the old house?
house is gone. Now what?
well, there's a shed over there.
roof over his head, place to keep Holly warm, a place to think.
this is it.
I hear something.
I'd like to talk to him. He's more comfortable with women.
okay. I'll cover you.
Trent? Are you in there?
my name is Sara. I'm here to help you.
Where's Holly? Is she okay?
are you alone?
we've been looking for you and your sister.
it's okay.
you're safe now, you can put the gun down.
Rylan Gauss did it.
he has my baby sister.
he killed Christine.
okay.
Rylan Gauss can't hurt you anymore.
dad was right. He's always right.
have to always, always watch for Rylan Gauss.
did you used to play here, in this shed?
when you lived here with your mother?
I know she loved you, Trent.
and she would want you to put the gun down.
if you hurt yourself, who's going to take care of your sister?
Rylan Gauss was there. I saw him.
where did he take her?
he follows us.
he talks to me.
Gauss is dead. You know that.
no. He's me.
I did it. I killed her!
I'm Rylan Gauss, I'm Rylan Gauss, ask my dad!
okay, okay, Rylan.
okay, listen, put the gun down, all right?
I kill little girls!
he-he has their pictures, ask my dad.
please, please, give me the gun. Okay?
it's okay.
give me the gun, Rylan. Give it to me.
it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
any info from Trent?
no, no. Maybe when his meds kick in, he'll tell us where Holly is, but at the moment, he's Mark David Chapman shooting John Lennon thinking he's John Lennon.
I hope it's not too late. - Me, too.
I believe we have an infestation.
hmm, Cimex lectularius, aka the common bedbug. Where did you find this?
I processed the ball cap that you found in Gauss's apartment.
Hey, do you know if Sara found any bedbugs at Trent Moore's place?
negative. Nor did I see bugs in the shed, but I did see bug bites on Trent.
but we didn't find any in Gauss's apartment.
Hey, are you sure this didn't come from your house there, itchy?
no. My mother is very clean.
maybe Trent picked them up wherever he has Holly stashed.
fire in the hole! Two shots!
the bullets that killed Rylan Gauss came from Trent Moore's . 22.
Trent's gun does not match the bullets that killed Christine Moore or the bagger at the market.
so there's another . 22 in play? Any leads on the shooter?
Trent told Sara it was Gauss.
well, Christine Moore was shot in the eye at close range-- that's Gauss's M. O.
but we know that Gauss wasn't the shooter.
so who else knew his M. O?
maybe a disgruntled husband going through a nasty divorce who's hunting a serial pedophile for ten years and trying to put back in prison for good. Maybe somebody like that.
Thanks, Catherine. I'll get back to you.
okay, so what happened?
you and Christine had an argument, huh?
you were sitting around watching, waiting.
you watched her pull out of the garage.
she was leaving in the middle of the night, she was leaving you, and she's taking your kids with her.
but what you didn't know was Trent was in the car.
did Trent tell you where Holly is?
Trent doesn't even know where he is.
he doesn't even know who he is.
most of the time he thinks he's Rylan Gauss.
a parent's obsession becomes a kid's delusion.
Trent thinks Gauss killed Christine.
but you and I know different.
I just wanted to give Trent a normal life.
and I wanted justice for those girls.
somewhere in between, I just ruined everything I ever loved.
look, you gotta be honest with your kid.
you gotta tell him straight up what happened in that grocery store parking lot, and maybe shock him into reality, because little Holly's three years old and she's out there alone and we don't have much time.
you and I both took an oath to protect the innocent.
well, here's the time. You gotta confess to your son.
you gotta tell him that Rylan Gauss wasn't the only bad guy in his life.
your daughter, your wife!
no, you didn't.
you're Trent. You're my son.
and you love Holly and you loved Christine.
he broke into my apartment and told me he was coming after them.
I fought him, but I couldn't stop him.
it's not real. It was you...
thinking you were Rylan Gauss.
that's why I went to Christine...
to warn her. To-to save Holly.
he killed them, Daddy, like you always said he would.
Trent, look at me.
Where's your sister, hmm?
cause I know you took her someplace safe.
Rylan Gauss took her. He took her.
I took her. I took her.
Trent, stop it!
you are not Rylan Gauss. You are my son.
Rylan Gauss, Rylan Gauss, Rylan Gauss. - Son, you killed Rylan!
you did it!
Rylan Gauss is dead.
you were at the supermarket with Holly...
...and you saw me.
not Rylan Gauss, me.
I didn't know you were there.
I wanted to put Gauss away for good.
I didn't want Christine to take you away from me.
now tell me... where's your sister?
Where's Holly, hmm? - I don't know.
she's gone.
she's gone. I-I lost her.
I lost her!
well, we got our confession.
I'd rather we had the little girl.
Archie looked for surveillance in the supermarket parking lot.
came up empty. - But?
but he was able to catch Christine's minivan on a traffic cam.
check it out. Trent was driving the van.
traffic cam picked this up ten minutes after the shooting.
Trent turned north off of Honolulu onto Glenwood.
that van's really booking.
so, after Christine was shot, Trent panicked. Thought that Rylan Gauss was after them.
and he was trying to protect his sister.
well, after he turned onto Glenwood, he disappears off the radar.
if he stashed her somewhere, I might be able to get you an area.
so he stopped somewhere in the 'hood. - It's a good-sized area.
Yeah, but he was running out of gas. He was scared.
he didn't have a lot of money.
he needed a safe place for Holly so he could go after Gauss.
maybe a motel. - Yeah, maybe one with bedbugs.
I'll call Environmental Health, check out the complaints at the motels in the area.
no luck. What do you got?
the manager recognized Trent, but he didn't recognize the little girl.
room seven.
bedbugs.
she was here.
Las Vegas Police.
Yes, yes, we are looking for the little girl.
the young man asked me to watch her for a little while but he never came back.
it's okay. Come on out there. - I didn't know what to do. I took care of her.
no, you did the right thing.
Hi, Holly. My name is Jim.
boy, we've been looking all over for you.
come on. I'm gonna take you home. Come on.
you blind, lady? Express checkout, 15 items or less.
express
I'm sorry, how much is it?
Holly, please stop.
sweetie, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry...
what are you waiting for, morning? Just pay!
I'm gonna have to write a check. - Aw, come on! It's cash only!
turn that crap down!
your noise-- turn it down!
well, I was needing to hit the grocery store this morning.
looks like someone had the same idea.
shots were fired, these two went down.
apparently, this whole thing started because of musical differences.
the smoker says the gangbangers did it.
there was a patrol car in the area.
they apprehended the gangbangers in the lot, searched the car, didn't find a gun.
now, the male victim-- his name is Hector Cortero.
he's been working here two weeks, and he's a cart collector.
prison tattoos. Shooting could be gang related.
Yeah, now, the female victim
we don't know who she is yet, but, uh, apparently, she's just an unlucky customer.
one bag of groceries, no purse, no keys, no cell phone in her pocket.
you know, this could be a robbery.
Bagger's prints are in the system, but according to AFIS, his real name is Hector Atoya.
he got a rap sheet? - Yeah, he did one year for a no-hit drive-by.
this could be retaliation.
second vic witnesses and becomes collateral damage.
Bagger's only hit once. She's hit three times.
two small-caliber gunshot wounds to the left chest, one to the right eye.
powder burns around the wound suggest that it was at close range.
looks like an execution.
which would make our soccer mom the primary target, but why?
Hey, this, uh, jerk over here just told me that our female vic had a kid.
a kid?! You get a description?
Yeah, little girl, about three years old; blonde hair.
Oh, and she had two bags of groceries.
she had a child and two bags of groceries.
I'm thinking she had a car.
we have a void. Maybe a tire crushed those pretzels.
she puts the child in first, gets one bag of groceries in the car and then...
bang. Killer jacks her ride, without knowing the kid's in the backseat.
Yeah, this is Brass. I'm down at the double 419 down at Honolulu.
we have a stolen vehicle with an abducted three-year-old blonde female.
we now have a 418/427.
amber Alert will be forthcoming.
you see these things, you hear about them, you never think you'll be involved.
so the victim was in your line?
and had you seen her in here before? Was she a regular?
Oh, no. Uh-uh, no. I never saw her before.
I've been working here a few years.
she had the cutest little kid with her, too.
she had too many items for the express line, but I don't think that was on purpose.
just, she seemed in a hurry and upset.
upset? How upset?
first, I thought it was just the guy behind her.
the "Express Line Nazi.
Yeah, yeah, we already talked to him, but you think she was upset about something else?
her hands were shaking.
the whole time, she seemed like she was about to cry.
Oh, and her cell phone rang.
Oh, it did? - Mm-hmm. She didn't answer it.
express line, so she, uh, she paid cash?
no. She didn't have enough.
I let her write a check.
Hey, Archie, it's Nick.
listen, I got a name and driver's license number - on our female victim. - Go.
Christine Moore. Nevada DL number 2266758771.
searching search results 2008 Dodge Caravan.
John-Henry- Victor-George-357.
anybody else on the registration?
next of kin, anything like that?
Daniel Moore. Probably her husband.
but registration's secured.
guy's got some kind of protected status.
well, that may be what got his wife killed.
Thanks.
huh. Looks like a . 22.
used to be the preferred caliber for mobsters and assassins.
nowadays they go for a Glock four-oh.
thank you, Ten Cent.
why don't you move him to Autopsy and try not to bust any rhymes on the way out.
I make no promises.
agent Moore, FBI.
uh, how can I help you?
looking for the female vic of the supermarket shooting.
she's in the washroom. But I... Hey.
whoa. Hold it right there.
agent Moore, FBI. - Yeah, congratulations.
nobody comes in here without my authorization.
Christine is my wife. - I'm sorry for your loss, but that's all the more reason for you not to be in here.
no one should ever see their loved one like this.
this is what I wanted to see-- her eye.
it's probably postmortem, if that's any consolation.
Oh, geez. Let me see that.
keep your hand elevated.
David, find the first aid kit!
hold this.
agent Moore. Captain Jim Brass. I came as soon as I could.
we have an AMBER Alert out on your daughter.
but I need you to keep it together.
can you give me a second? - Yeah. Hold it up.
now, I know this is tough, but when a wife is murdered, do you have an alibi for last night?
I was on a case. I can save you a lot of time.
I know who killed Christine. The name is Rylan Gauss.
and he has my daughter.
so I got an AG waiver on Christine Moore's missing cell phone.
she got a message five minutes before she was killed.
checker at the market said Christine received a call that she didn't answer.
that was from a Trent Moore.
guy sounds young. Maybe her son.
it's him, Christine.
it's Gauss. I've seen him.
he's following you and Holly! I-I don't know what to do!
he's going to kill us all, just like Dad said!
I'm gonna give you some temporary stitches in a little bit, but they won't hold long, so I would advise you to get an X-ray and some antibiotics.
Rylan Gauss is a federal case.
I don't know anything about it. What can you tell me about him?
he's a serial pedophile.
he steals the little girls right out of their beds.
the mother intervened on the last one. Gauss shot her in the eye.
Ah, just like, uh...
Yeah. - ...your wife.
I chased him for ten years.
six little girls. I never found any of them.
nothing to link him to any of the crimes.
I was able to nail him for the murder of the mother, though. 25-to-life.
how'd the guy get out of prison?
52 days ago, the conviction was overturned.
the appeals court tossed out the lead batch analysis that the Bureau used to link the murder bullet to Gauss' live ammo.
has he contacted you or threatened you?
me and my family.
given his M. O.my daughter doesn't have much time.
and I don't even want to think... All right, enough already, okay? We're done.
okay, take it easy. Thanks a lot, Doc. - Yeah.
is there anyone else that Gauss, uh, may be after?
I have a son from my first marriage.
what's his name? - Trent.
Hey, Trent, it's Dad. You call me back immediately.
Katie, it's Mr. Moore. Could I speak with Trent, please?
you sure he's not out on a delivery or...?
no, when you see him, you make him call me.
no, it's an emergency.
Trent didn't show up to work today. It's not like him.
let's go.
Las Vegas Police!
he has Trent. - If Gauss was here, he would've shot you coming through the door.
you got to ratchet it down a notch, okay?
control, this is Brass.
I need an APB out on Rylan Gauss, white male in his 30s, armed and dangerous.
bastard's got my whole family.
ready?
Rylan Gauss, Vegas PD! We got a warrant!
it's all clear.
we'll take it from here, boys. - Thank you.
if I was Gauss, out for revenge,
I'd kill Agent Moore's wife and his teenage son.
and take the little girl,'cause I get off on it.
Yeah. - Check the bed.
nothing but porno mags.
where else could he hide her?
let's tear the place apart.
looks like the point of entry.
there's some granular trace on the sill.
it's corn starch.
from cheap latex gloves.
that's Gauss' M. O. He always wears them.
guy comes in through the window, he jimmies it open with a chisel
that's what that mark is, right there.
agent Moore, with all due respect, you need to back off and let me do my job.
you're... overlaying my shoe impressions.
it's not going to be that hard to distinguish, okay?
Gauss wears a size 10, Nosumi soles.
agent Moore?
you are contaminating my crime scene.
Hey, buddy. We get it, okay?
the crime scene investigator is a professional.
she's working as fast as she can, all right?
well, I've seen it too many times, okay?
Cop-fast turns into hostage-late.
Hey, hey, back off! All right? Back off.
I'll take care of Gauss myself, then.
let him go, Mitch. Go ahead, get out of here.
looks like we got a pill dump.
people don't usually throw away narcotics unless they have to.
olanzapine and aripiprazole.
Trent Moore was on meds, antidepressants.
hmm. So Rylan Gauss flushed them?
it's a good way to control a hostage.
he could've kept a few, used them to force the kid's cooperation.
that's assuming that Trent Moore is still alive.
the agent who delivered these files said that Daniel Moore is the FBI's top pedophile hunter.
Ironic-- his own kids get snatched.
Yeah, well, not so ironic if one of the guys he's been chasing decided to turn the tables on him.
all right, the offender profile says that Rylan Gauss started in his early 20s, followed a typical escalation pattern
indecent exposure, couple of burglary charges.
social Services investigated an incident involving a female cousin.
four years old.
Gauss' parents wouldn't cooperate.
I hate it when the families protect these guys.
all right, well, let's look for anything about how long he usually kept the girls, or where he might have taken them.
Hey, Nicky. I got something.
it's a, uh...
clothes hanger made into some kind of a tool.
maybe for fishing something out of a tight space?
let me see that thing.
Yeah, there's something behind this panel.
if it's kiddy porn, we got him.
an Elephant Named Herman.
my Puppy Dog Tale, Kitty Cat Clues?
children's read-aloud books.
they never caught Gauss with any evidence from his victims.
personal items belonging to the missing girls disappeared just prior to their abductions, including children's books.
the items disappeared while the victims were playing in the park.
Gauss selects his victims from local parks.
that's where he does his shopping.
the Animal Fair. He didn't just go out and buy these.
looks like they got some years on 'em.
maybe the belonged to the victims.
they could be trophies.
print 'em.
this is Catherine. - Is there a park near your location?
Yeah, we passed one as we were driving into the neighborhood. Why?
Gauss doesn't keep his victims long.
and when he's done, he goes back out hunting in parks.
there he is right there.
what the hell is Agent Moore doing here? Gun!
agent Moore, put your gun down!
stand down!
get off me.
where is she?! - Where's who?
Where's Holly Moore? - I don't even know who that is!
fine. You're under arrest.
let go of me.
what's that about? - It's not illegal to make a video.
that-that's a cute little girl.
I wish I had one just like her.
what were you doing in the park, Rylan? On a play date?
after you were done with Holly Moore?
I spent five years in prison.
I like parks, open spaces.
I like to look at pretty things.
Where's Holly Moore?
is that any relation to a Daniel Moore?
come on. You know it is.
you threatened her whole family.
Oh, did you lose that sweet little girl of yours, Daniel?
I'm sorry.
Oh, but you have two children, so you still have one left, right?
Yeah, right. Let's talk about Trent Moore.
he certainly had a lot to say about you.
it's him, Christine. It's Gauss. I've seen him.
he's following you and Holly! I don't know what to do!
he-he's going to kill us all, just like Dad said!
no, no, no. No, that's a frame-up.
I went to prison for a crime I didn't commit.
it didn't work the first time, and he's trying to get me again.
he accused me of being a psycho. Me, a psycho?!
the guy stalks me my whole life! He's the sick one!
you hear that, Daniel?! You're the sick one!
so where were you last night?
Oh, last night? - Yeah.
um, I was in a...
a bar, the Red Lamp, off of Fremont.
the bartender's name was, um, Terry.
talked about how he needs a new head gasket for his car.
he'll remember the conversation. You just have to ask him.
feel pretty good about that, huh? What do you think?
you're just gonna waltz out of here, whistling a tune?
I went to the animal fair The birds and the beasts were there And the big baboon by the light of the moon Was combing his auburn...
hair.
I bet you know all the words to that, don't you?
Yeah, we found your stash of books, buddy.
and the lab guys are going over the prints right now.
and I'll tell you something.
if we find one print that matches up with any of those missing girls, that'll be your last walk in the park.
amber Alert picked up the Moore minivan.
car seat, no little girl.
the grocery store is across town, but we're walking distance to Gauss's place.
van's out of gas.
I have cookie crumbs on the car seat and half a juice box.
half a sandwich, egg salad.
from Cordon's Ranch Market, dated yesterday.
Christine Moore must have bought it.
how many three-year-olds do you know like egg salad?
I don't know any three-year-olds, but I do know that if Christine didn't eat it, and Holly didn't eat it, then whoever was driving this car must have. Right?
Gauss.
no match
ran the sandwich cellophane against Gauss's prints. No match.
whoever ate the sandwich took the girl.
if it wasn't Gauss, who was it?
the books we found in Gauss's apartment had no prints.
they're in no way a connection to any of these missing girls.
you gotta be kidding me. - No, sir, I'm not.
all we found were traces of cornstarch between the pages.
Yeah. Because Gauss wears latex gloves.
he sits there torturing these little girls while he's reading to them from their own favorite books.
I advise you not to leave town.
Oh, no, I'm not going anywhere.
just keep Mr. FBI away from me, or I'll have to get a restraining order.
uh, I hope your kids are all right, there, Danny.
you know, all that time wasted on me.
only have yourself to blame. Only yourself.
you're just going to let him go?
if we do anything now, it'll only come back to hurt us when we do try to nail him.
when is that going to be?
Jim! He just as much admitted that my kids are dead.
Hey, when I put him in prison, he's gonna stay there!
not going to get out on some technicality.
and by the way, his alibi checks out, you know.
not only with the bartender, but several patrons who he was drinking with all night.
Rylan Gauss didn't kill your wife!
he was in a bar.
Gauss is the only angle. You heard Trent's voice mail.
Gauss is stalking my family, and now you're just going to let him go.
Hey, file a complaint. I'll have him arrested.
are we on the same side here anymore?
is it just me, or does he not seem that broken up about his dead wife?
it's his focus; it's all about Gauss, even when the evidence points away from him.
you know, Nicky, I've known a lot of guys like Daniel Moore.
when things go bad, both professionally or personally, it's always the bastard that got away.
and Rylan Gauss makes one hell of a boogeyman.
I just got off the phone with Christine Moore's sister.
she called to arrange release of the body to a mortuary in Wichita.
isn't that usually up to the spouse?
unless the spouses are in the middle of an ugly divorce.
did Agent Moore mention that? - No, he left that out.
Yeah, that's what I figured. So I gave her my best Quincy, and she was more than happy to rat out her brother-in-law.
Christine was asking for sole custody of her daughter, and filing for guardianship of her stepson.
Guardianship?
Trent's 18. He's been living on his own.
Christine was going to court to prove that Moore was an unfit father.
according to her sister, the plan was to move both kids back to Kansas.
okay, well...
if Daniel Moore weren't FBI, we'd be looking at him for the murder of his wife.
Jim? I need you to verify the alibi for Daniel Moore.
good call, Cap.
agent Moore's car is parked around back. It's still warm.
Rylan Gauss's apartment is the last place this guy should be.
let's hope he didn't do anything stupid.
drop it. Now!
my gun hasn't been fired. You can check it.
I want your backup piece.
it's in the small of my back. I'm reaching now.
two fingers.
son of a bitch was down when I got here.
not that I didn't come here looking to kneecap him.
torture him until he told me where my kids are.
but unfortunately, someone beat me to it.
Yeah, right. Let's go.
the pills you collected from Trent Moore's bathroom floor are antidepressants, but they're also used in combination to treat emerging schizophrenia.
do we know if the kid had any psychological problems?
no, we don't. He was living alone, holding down a job.
not atypical.
when the disease becomes full-blown in adulthood, medications ramp up in proportion to the increase in delusions and paranoia.
agent Moore never mentioned that his son is schizophrenic.
he's got a bad habit of leaving things out.
I know we think Gauss killed Trent, but if he didn't, and Trent's been off his meds for the past 24 hours, then there's a good probability he's in the middle of a full-blown psychotic episode.
sandwich wrapper. - Trent likes egg salad.
which puts him in the van, when Christine and Holly came out of the supermarket.
he was probably there the whole time.
question is, what was he doing in the minivan with Christine and Holly, at 4: 00 a. m?
whatever the reason, he witnessed the shooting.
three GSWs to the torso. Small caliber.
same as the supermarket.
well, if Agent Moore shot Gauss, did he also shoot his wife?
they were going through a nasty divorce.
position of the body suggests he was hit as he entered.
agent Moore must've been lying in wait.
but how? Where's the . 22?
we didn't find it on him.
so why ditch a throw-away, and then come back and stand over the body with your service weapon out?
fast First Deliveries.
agent Moore's son works for a messenger service.
that wasn't here before.
74% of children who are abducted are dead within three hours.
it's been 24.
so the longer we sit here talking about what I didn't do, the less chance I have of ever seeing them again.
I know the numbers, all right? I want to talk about Trent.
your son is a clinically diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic.
my son, Trent, is fine.
he's just fine. What are you talking about?
we found psychotropic meds in his apartment.
now, clearly, he's under psychiatric treatment.
the meds just make you crazy.
I told Christine he didn't need to take them.
Oh, and this is based on what, your experience as a psychoanalyst?
don't push that angle on me.
you know the job.
we hunt down these scum who torture and rape children.
and you just got to suck it up.
cause there's no little pill that's just going to make this world a better place.
you know, your behavior has been erratic since I met you.
they say that mental illness runs in families.
everybody drinks the Kool-Aid, now
Christine, you,$200 shrinks.
well, not me. And not my son. We're the crazy people now?
my son and I are crazy, while Rylan Gauss is sane? Go to hell.
Gauss is dead.
you want to know what's really crazy?
we have evidence that Trent was in Gauss's apartment.
now, does your son have access to a small-caliber firearm, specifically, a . 22?
Gauss was killed with a . 22?
as was Christine, as was the bagger.
now, we're pulling slugs from the autopsy right now, and I think we're going to get a match.
Trent was with Christine, in the minivan, at the grocery store, at the time of the shooting.
now, what is Trent's relationship with his little sister Holly?
I refuse to believe this-- any of it!
well, let me tell you what I believe, okay?
Trent was not kidnapped.
he stopped taking his meds.
he's having a psychotic episode. He killed Gauss.
and as hard as this is to say, I think he killed Christine.
now the question is, would he harm his little sister Holly?
he loves Holly.
if Trent had Holly, where would he take her?
my first wife died of cancer when Trent was ten.
they were very close.
sometimes, he just likes to go back to the old house.
Where's the old house?
house is gone. Now what?
well, there's a shed over there.
roof over his head, place to keep Holly warm, a place to think.
this is it.
I hear something.
I'd like to talk to him. He's more comfortable with women.
okay. I'll cover you.
Trent? Are you in there?
my name is Sara. I'm here to help you.
Where's Holly? Is she okay?
are you alone?
we've been looking for you and your sister.
it's okay.
you're safe now, you can put the gun down.
Rylan Gauss did it.
he has my baby sister.
he killed Christine.
okay.
Rylan Gauss can't hurt you anymore.
dad was right. He's always right.
have to always, always watch for Rylan Gauss.
did you used to play here, in this shed?
when you lived here with your mother?
I know she loved you, Trent.
and she would want you to put the gun down.
if you hurt yourself, who's going to take care of your sister?
Rylan Gauss was there. I saw him.
where did he take her?
he follows us.
he talks to me.
Gauss is dead. You know that.
no. He's me.
I did it. I killed her!
I'm Rylan Gauss, I'm Rylan Gauss, ask my dad!
okay, okay, Rylan.
okay, listen, put the gun down, all right?
I kill little girls!
he-he has their pictures, ask my dad.
please, please, give me the gun. Okay?
it's okay.
give me the gun, Rylan. Give it to me.
it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
any info from Trent?
no, no. Maybe when his meds kick in, he'll tell us where Holly is, but at the moment, he's Mark David Chapman shooting John Lennon thinking he's John Lennon.
I hope it's not too late. - Me, too.
I believe we have an infestation.
hmm, Cimex lectularius, aka the common bedbug. Where did you find this?
I processed the ball cap that you found in Gauss's apartment.
Hey, do you know if Sara found any bedbugs at Trent Moore's place?
negative. Nor did I see bugs in the shed, but I did see bug bites on Trent.
but we didn't find any in Gauss's apartment.
Hey, are you sure this didn't come from your house there, itchy?
no. My mother is very clean.
maybe Trent picked them up wherever he has Holly stashed.
fire in the hole! Two shots!
the bullets that killed Rylan Gauss came from Trent Moore's . 22.
Trent's gun does not match the bullets that killed Christine Moore or the bagger at the market.
so there's another . 22 in play? Any leads on the shooter?
Trent told Sara it was Gauss.
well, Christine Moore was shot in the eye at close range-- that's Gauss's M. O.
but we know that Gauss wasn't the shooter.
so who else knew his M. O?
maybe a disgruntled husband going through a nasty divorce who's hunting a serial pedophile for ten years and trying to put back in prison for good. Maybe somebody like that.
Thanks, Catherine. I'll get back to you.
okay, so what happened?
you and Christine had an argument, huh?
you were sitting around watching, waiting.
you watched her pull out of the garage.
she was leaving in the middle of the night, she was leaving you, and she's taking your kids with her.
but what you didn't know was Trent was in the car.
did Trent tell you where Holly is?
Trent doesn't even know where he is.
he doesn't even know who he is.
most of the time he thinks he's Rylan Gauss.
a parent's obsession becomes a kid's delusion.
Trent thinks Gauss killed Christine.
but you and I know different.
I just wanted to give Trent a normal life.
and I wanted justice for those girls.
somewhere in between, I just ruined everything I ever loved.
look, you gotta be honest with your kid.
you gotta tell him straight up what happened in that grocery store parking lot, and maybe shock him into reality, because little Holly's three years old and she's out there alone and we don't have much time.
you and I both took an oath to protect the innocent.
well, here's the time. You gotta confess to your son.
you gotta tell him that Rylan Gauss wasn't the only bad guy in his life.
your daughter, your wife!
no, you didn't.
you're Trent. You're my son.
and you love Holly and you loved Christine.
he broke into my apartment and told me he was coming after them.
I fought him, but I couldn't stop him.
it's not real. It was you...
thinking you were Rylan Gauss.
that's why I went to Christine...
to warn her. To-to save Holly.
he killed them, Daddy, like you always said he would.
Trent, look at me.
Where's your sister, hmm?
cause I know you took her someplace safe.
Rylan Gauss took her. He took her.
I took her. I took her.
Trent, stop it!
you are not Rylan Gauss. You are my son.
Rylan Gauss, Rylan Gauss, Rylan Gauss. - Son, you killed Rylan!
you did it!
Rylan Gauss is dead.
you were at the supermarket with Holly...
...and you saw me.
not Rylan Gauss, me.
I didn't know you were there.
I wanted to put Gauss away for good.
I didn't want Christine to take you away from me.
now tell me... where's your sister?
Where's Holly, hmm? - I don't know.
she's gone.
she's gone. I-I lost her.
I lost her!
well, we got our confession.
I'd rather we had the little girl.
Archie looked for surveillance in the supermarket parking lot.
came up empty. - But?
but he was able to catch Christine's minivan on a traffic cam.
check it out. Trent was driving the van.
traffic cam picked this up ten minutes after the shooting.
Trent turned north off of Honolulu onto Glenwood.
that van's really booking.
so, after Christine was shot, Trent panicked. Thought that Rylan Gauss was after them.
and he was trying to protect his sister.
well, after he turned onto Glenwood, he disappears off the radar.
if he stashed her somewhere, I might be able to get you an area.
so he stopped somewhere in the 'hood. - It's a good-sized area.
Yeah, but he was running out of gas. He was scared.
he didn't have a lot of money.
he needed a safe place for Holly so he could go after Gauss.
maybe a motel. - Yeah, maybe one with bedbugs.
I'll call Environmental Health, check out the complaints at the motels in the area.
no luck. What do you got?
the manager recognized Trent, but he didn't recognize the little girl.
room seven.
bedbugs.
she was here.
Las Vegas Police.
Yes, yes, we are looking for the little girl.
the young man asked me to watch her for a little while but he never came back.
it's okay. Come on out there. - I didn't know what to do. I took care of her.
no, you did the right thing.
Hi, Holly. My name is Jim.
boy, we've been looking all over for you.
come on. I'm gonna take you home. Come on.
strangled!
left outside the dumpster.
that's a new one.
maybe the killer wanted her to be found.
wait-- you actually think this is real?
well look at her coloring, she is not dead.
with all due respect, Mandy, you're a fingerprint expert, and this is kind of out of your league.
and I quote,"She is not only merely dead, she is most sincerely dead.
I beg to differ, Dorothy.
if you knew your Wizard of Oz, you'd know that it was the Munchkin coroner that pronounced her dead, not the girl with the dog.
slow night in here, kids?
you do know that everything posted on this Web site's fake, don't you?
I mean, come on. You guys are supposed to be professionals.
exactly what I've been trying to tell them.
so, you made up your mind already?
you haven't thoroughly examined the photo.
that's not very professional.
all right, zoom in on the hand.
look there, by her knuckle.
blood vessels are distended; that means she has blood pressure.
arms flexed, muscles are contracted.
she's alive. It's a fake.
case closed.
hand is below the level of her heart.
blood's pooled in her extremity, distending the vessels.
it could be lividity, not blood pressure.
but how do you explain that flexed arm?
body position puts pressure on the tendons, pulling her arm into a slight flex.
I say she's dead.
hard to tell without a body. - You're right.
and if this is real, then we have a DB off the strip.
looks like it's, uh, west of the Tropicana.
we should go check it out.
I'm telling you, it's a waste of time.
hundred bucks says I'm right.
I don't even think you have $100. But let's go; I'll drive.
LVPD-- make a hole, people.
Oh, man, this just keeps getting better.
she is most sincerely dead.
I suppose it would be tasteless for me to mention the 100 bucks you owe me.
extremely.
any of you curious kittens think to call 911?
dispatch, Charlie 0-5 Stokes. I got a 419. I need two backup units to my location.
Hey, man!
Hey, that's my camera.
Yeah, well, now it's our evidence.
and this is our crime scene.
and you're a suspect. I want to see some I.D.
and that goes for the rest of you! Nobody's leaving now!
you're all suspects! I want to see some I.D!
come on, now.
where you going, bud?
show's just getting started.
look, Officer, I just got off work at the diner.
you can call my boss. He'll tell you I was there all night.
I came by 'cause I saw the picture on the Web site.
nice little crime scene you got here.
so you called in your own 419 off a Web posting?
I mean, I heard of firemen setting fires to get overtime.
don't tell me you're dropping bodies for extra cash.
well, he does need 100 bucks.
T.O.D. was four to six hours ago.
petechial hemorrhaging, consistent with strangulation.
Yeah, the orange cord around her neck was my first clue.
Yeah. Looks like a lanyard.
something was attached to it-- an I.D. badge or... security pass.
could be a robbery.
little black dress, stilettos-- she could be a tourist.
or working girl.
either way, she should have stuck to the Strip.
I mean, you know, out here-- isolated lot, at night-- this place is bad news.
victim is Amber Rowe. Priors for solicitation and possession.
well, C.O.D.'s asphyxiation due to strangulation.
I did a wet mount. She had intercourse shortly before death.
lots of swimmers.
and I thought hookers enforced the raincoat rule.
anyway, she died around 1: 00 a. m.
most hookers hit the streets between 11: 00 and midnight.
maybe those swimmers were from her first and last trick of the night.
well, I sent the rape kit to DNA.
you mind if I use your laptop for a second?
open a new window. I'm in the middle of an auction-- Robert Johnson 78s.
what's up, Nicky?
this is a photo from the Web site.
take a look at the position of the lanyard.
it's tight around the bottom of her neck-- here.
but the ligature mark on the body's different.
it's higher, at an angle.
this is not a match.
the killer dumped the body, Nick.
the lanyard could've changed position.
could be any number of explanations.
I don't know. The dress in the photo looks different, too.
excuse me?
they're not the same.
there's sequins along the neckline of the dress.
take a look at the dress she was found in.
Yeah, right here.
no sequins.
same location... and I know this is the same girl.
the photo shows a different dress, different ligature.
well, how's that happen?
so I contacted the Web hosts from VictimsOfVegas.com.
they sent over the metadata for the uploaded photo.
according to the data, the picture of your dead hooker was taken at 12: 23 a. m. two nights ago.
but she died around 1: 00 a. m.-- this morning.
so the photo was taken at least 24 hours before she died.
your metadata must be wrong.
no, no, I don't think so.
you really can't stand to lose a bet, can you?
are you in on this? - Wait. Don't look at me. Data's data.
zoom in on that hubcap, Archie.
Fireworks?! - Yep.
over the Tangiers. Every Wednesday night from midnight to 12: 30.
this photo was taken two nights ago, Greg, and she was alive.
I think you owe the man 100 bucks.
so what are we saying?
a killer fakes a photo of a dead hooker in a Dumpster 24 hours before he kills her for real?
that's insane.
no. No, you know what's really insane?
betting against me.
let's go, baby.
thanks a lot, Archie.
didn't hear you ride up.
thought you said it was just running rough.
Yeah, it was until about a half mile ago when it died in front of a high school...
full of youngsters who need to be taught that this is proper motorcycle attire and not fodder for ridicule.
I thought you said this bike was all original.
that's what the guy at the swap meet told me.
you bought a vintage bike at a swap meet?
is that bad?
tell me you got the name and number of the guy that sold this bike to you.
well, he-he had honest eyes and a firm handshake.
your headlight, your tank-- that's real.
your taillight's retro, your seat's retro...
you got some... sloppy welding here at the exhaust.
this, uh, rearview mirror is certainly not original.
so I got suckered.
Yes, you did.
my bike's a Frankenstein monster.
Yes, Igor.
but listen... maybe we can get it running again for you.
you been working on the bike, David?
no. Why?
Well...there's blood on your air filter.
think I may have found your problem.
what is that? - That is tissue.
see the ridge detail? - Yeah.
and the partial nail?
judging from the width, I'd say this was the tip of someone's thumb.
all I wanted to buy was a sweet ride.
well, it looks like you bought yourself a crime scene.
Yeah, you're right.
you know, I've been defrauded. - And "bethumbed.
Yeah, I'm going to get to the bottom of this!
you wanted to be in the field more.
follow the evidence.
I talked to this vice cop I know.
he said that Amber Rowe was a regular, but that she cleaned her act up.
she got out of the business about six months ago.
guess not.
LVPD! Open up!
can I help you?
Yeah, we're looking for Amber Rowe's apartment. Who are you?
I'm her boyfriend.
she, uh... promised me she wasn't going to do it anymore.
do you know if she had a pimp?
obviously she was... pretty good at hiding that stuff from me.
so, she must have been getting calls from dates, all hours of the day and night.
how'd she hide that?
she told me that she was modeling, you know?
that things were going really well for her.
so let me get this straight. Your model girlfriend doesn't come home last night, and you don't start to think there might be something wrong?
she called me last night, all right?
just after midnight-- and told me that she was out with some of her friends.
she'd see me in the morning. It's Vegas.
and what's your first name again? - Craig.
and, uh... what is it that you do for a living, Craig?
I do a little consulting.
in your pajamas? In the middle of the day?
Hey, you know, I,uh... don't see much, uh, consulting going on.
Hey, I don't let my girlfriend support me, if that's what you think.
all right, look. I mean, I think, deep down...I knew.
you know? But I couldn't stop her.
for Amber, hooking was... was like a drug, you know?
Nah, I just, uh, I don't know.
I don't know, I guess she stayed with me 'cause...I made her feel safe.
tell you what, why don't you put on some clothes and have a cup of coffee with the officer outside while we take a look around here for a little bit?
I mean, you don't mind, do you?
you got nothing to hide.
no.
I examined that little black dress that Nick and I found in Amber Rowe's apartment.
Oh, the one she was wearing when she wasn't dead?
Yeah, found hairs-- Equus burchelli, otherwise known as zebra-- confined to the butt area of the dress.
so, what, she was sitting on a zebra?
more likely zebra-skin seats.
I thought zebra seats went out with disco.
well, actually, they're making a comeback, starting about three hours ago.
now, a buddy in Patrol sent this to me.
it's not an official police photo, but it's been making the rounds.
that's Carrot Top.
he went missing the other night.
kidnapped for a few hours.
looks like he was found.
zoom in on his wrists.
that's the same type of lanyard used to strangle Amber Rowe.
sure is.
carrot Top and a dead hooker.
why am I not laughing?
so what's the deal, Captain? The sheriff told my manager everything was cool.
I said I wouldn't press any charges.
well, now we know why.
the other night got a little wilder than your story about how some crazed fans kidnapped you, got you drunk, and hog-tied you in the back of a limo.
well, when you're a celebrity-- icon, you know-- things are a little nutty.
sometimes you're a target, you know? There's a lot of crazy people out here.
icon.
my face is on a room key. Dude, I kill in Vegas-- look at that.
that's what we want to talk to you about.
you seen her before?
looks like you knew her.
I did know her. She was alive when I knew her-- she was hot.
when I say that, I mean, like, in a live way.
she was, she was definitely alive when I saw her last.
and how did you two get together?
I had a show the other night and, uh, I wanted to blow off a little steam, so I got a limo, just in case things turned out better than they normally do.
carrot Top's Wild Ride.
how'd it start?
it started at a, uh, strip club.
I know, shocker, right? It's called Crazy Ponies.
it was great 'cause some of my fans were there, and so, that's good,'cause they buy you drinks and everything else, so...
and this girl-- was, was she the "everything else"?
she was the "everything else," yeah.
I remember her high-beams.
very attractive.
couple guys there, too. I don't remember them as well.
after that, it was lights out.
next thing I know, I see a bunch of cops laughing at me, and I wasn't telling any jokes, so we kind of wanted to keep it on the lowdown, you know,'cause I have a reputation.
you probably know that, though.
Hog-tied...in your boxer shorts, passed out on zebra skin. - Yep.
that's kind of an image you can't get out of your head.
it's an image we'd all like to get out of our heads. Thanks for bringing it up.
so these guys that were in the limo-- can you describe them for me?
uh, my eyes were more on the girl.
uh, they were two preppy guys, and they asked for, for passes, and they were nice, so I gave 'em a couple backstage passes, and they used them to, uh, tie me up.
well, you're lucky you didn't end up like Amber.
to think the Topper was in danger. - Yeah.
it's a shame only the good die young, isn't it?
I get, like, one phone call, don't I?
you don't need a lawyer, Topper.
I know, I need my publicist.
what do you think-- cheap jewelry?
well, looks like it's from some sort of costume.
could be from a previous rental.
so do you think you have to request zebra-skin seats, or did Carrot Top just get lucky?
ran DNA on the thumb and blood we found on my motorcycle air filter.
the blood and the thumb were from two different contributors?
ran both through CODIS, ran the thumb through AFIS.
there were no hits on the thumb, but the blood came back to an unidentified male victim in a bus accident.
a month ago, Highway 19, head-on collision between two buses.
both drivers were killed.
now, the blood wasn't a match to either one of the drivers, but the unknown male was thought to be a passenger on one of the buses.
I don't think so.
you're thinking the unknown male wasn't on the bus. He was on your bike?
I think the body was vaporized.
it's possible, isn't it?
well, there's no mention of a motorcycle in this accident report.
nor in any of the news reports, but that doesn't mean my bike wasn't there.
doesn't it?
Oh, come on, surely you've heard this story. It's been around for decades.
no.
family in a VW Beetle are crushed between two semis.
nobody realizes this until they pry the semis apart and there's the VW, accordioned, with the family entombed inside it.
that sounds like an urban myth to me.
Yeah, more like a fairy tale compared to what must have happened that dark night on that lonely stretch of two-lane terror.
it says here it happened during the day.
also says... the wreckage was hauled away by Mars Brothers Salvage.
you might want to check that out.
if you're looking for tickets for a show, I could call in a favor, but...
Thanks. Actually, I'm looking for these.
found them in the limo.
trace says the chain is silicon-bronze plated and the emerald is tourmaline.
it's costume jewelry.
emphasis being on costume.
bring up the Mediterranean.
I already checked. The showroom's dark.
no, not the showroom, the casino.
and click on the photo gallery.
okay, now pull up that photo of the Spartan in the Agora.
the what? - The mall.
I helped Sam pick out those costumes when I was a little girl.
I loved Kirk Douglas in Spartacus.
I loved his skirt, his himation.
I take it that's Greek?
it's the cloak.
that and the skirt were my idea.
all I'm saying is that your trace is from a Greek.
Spartacus was in that limo.
two nights ago, I was on a bathroom break.
can't be easy in that getup.
well, it's not so much the skirt as it is the armor and weaponry.
right up here.
scene of the crime.
I go to the gym, work out.
like to think I can handle myself, but these guys caught me at a strategic disadvantage.
Guys"-- so there was more than one?
well, it would take at least two. I mean, I didn't actually see 'em.
here we are.
all right, well, tell me what happened.
sat my gear down on the floor like I always do, took a seat.
I grabbed onto the door, but they hit me with it.
bastard took my sword, cloak, shield and helmet.
I mean, took me half a week's pay to replace them.
why would anyone want that stuff?
I mean, what guy's gonna dress like a Spartan if he doesn't have to?
well, I can think of about 300.
excuse me.
I think I found your barbarians.
I don't know what to tell you, boys.
we just haul the wrecks away and sell off any good parts we can salvage.
do you recall a head-on collision between two buses on Highway 19 last month?
Oh, yeah. Hell of a mess.
pretty nasty cleanup, too.
well, do you still have the buses here?
Oh, boy.
you know, my brother Denny's in charge of inventory.
what?
Hey, where are them two buses from that demo derby on 19?
they're over in row nine.
man, he's good. He's got one of them photogenic memories.
clearly.
mind if I take a look?
no-- anything for the police.
Hey, just remember me next time I get a ticket.
will do.
Yeah. Yeah, I,too, am blessed with a photogenic memory.
you're good here.
I'm gonna get to work. - All right. Right down that way. This row right here.
just holler if you need a hand, partner.
Oh, no.
how embarrassing!
you are so busted! Cyber-schmooze on your own time there, Arch.
Yeah, we're in the middle of a case here.
so am I.
in fact, when you were on your bathroom break with the Spartan,
I traced the photo of the living hooker back to a social networking site.
Oh, yeah? Did you get us a name?
no. But I got three prepaid cell phone users all sharing photos on the site, anonymously.
see, there's Carrot Top... - And Amber.
number three: "Kidnap a celebrity"?
check out number two.
steal from a casino.
and number one?
grand theft auto.
I mean, all these photos were posted on the same night-- the night before your hooker was actually murdered.
including this photo, that ended up on VictimsOfVegas.
number four: "Kill a hooker.
okay, three cell phones, three suspects-- this is like some kind of twisted bucket list.
the night starts with stealing a car, ends in murder.
except it didn't-- they only went through with the first three things on the list.
and they didn't kill the hooker.
at least not until the following night.
all right, so, maybe on the first night, the creeps got cold feet.
and then, the next night, they decided to complete their list before heading home.
let's just hope the list ends here.
the part I pulled from the bus at the junkyard was definitely from a Triumph motorcycle.
sounds like you found out where the parts for your Frankenstein bike came from.
serial number traced back to a bike owned by a Peter Farmer.
last known address: 214 Harlan Way.
Yeah, it's an apartment. I talked to the landlord.
farmer's ex-girlfriend still lives there.
you bringing her in?
she's on her way to PD. - Great.
care to join me? - Why not?
I can't believe it.
are you sure, smashed between two busses?
we're sorry for your loss.
uh, when was the last time you... saw Peter?
the day he left.
I felt bad; I-I made him lunch. Curry egg salad.
I love that. On toast points.
I remember his last words.
we'll always have Comic Con.
you were very close.
I loved him.
but... he couldn't commit.
he never loved me the way he loved his mother.
that's why I ended it.
it's my fault. I'm the reason he was on that motorcycle.
why do you say that?
after I broke up with Peter, he was... lost, adrift, searching.
he bought the bike.
bought a whole outfit.
he looked just like Marlon Brando in The Wild One.
except thinner.
he wanted to... hit the open road and...find himself.
I know.
may I ask you something? - Okay.
was there...anything he could have said, was there...something he could have done that would have convinced you to give him one more chance?
um... I've asked myself that same question over and over.
And?
there is one thing.
what?
it's my boyfriend.
uh, he's got a big race today-- triathlete. I, uh, I gotta go.
thank you for... for telling me about Peter.
you remind me so much of him.
thank you.
uh, can I ask you something? - Yes. What is it?
how far did he get?
the Grand Canyon? Glacier Park? Nova Scotia?
Highway 19, near the 12 junction.
a quarter mile.
Archie got the numbers from the prepaid cells that shared the bucket list photos on the social networking site.
area codes are all 312.
Chicago.
even a life of rooting for the Cubs is no excuse for this behavior.
so we know where the guys are from, we just don't know who they are.
I might be able to help with that.
the prints on the men's door that clocked that Spartan came back to a Scott Horan.
arrested ten years ago for trespassing.
he tried to mount Caesar's chariot and race it down the Strip.
What?!
I love this town.
looks like our chariot-jacker's from Chicago.
let's see what he's doing now.
Scott Horan-- still living in the Windy City.
32 years old.
guy's got a Maybach and a Bentley registered to him.
boy's got dough.
you know how boys tire of their toys.
but if he considers this playtime, we need to end it.
I'll have Brass trap Horan's credit cards.
so, hotel security spotted Scott Horan in a long checkout line.
we pulled his credit cards receipts.
we found out that he bought three plane tickets and three rooms.
the other names are Hunter Ahern and Jeff Blakely.
that must be our other two suspects.
exactamente.
Larry, Curly and Moe.
Las Vegas Police. You're under arrest.
we-we didn't do anything.
what the hell'd you do, Scott?
dude, you dime us out?
no, hey, look... hey, this isn't what you think.
big misunderstanding. Huge!
seriously, I can explain!
look, we didn't do anything.
really, Hunter? Who's lying, you or the pictures?
we were just playing a game.
felony murder's not a game.
golf is a game.
we came to Vegas to celebrate our ten-year college reunion.
Oh, yeah? Is killing a hooker how you celebrate?
uh, these pictures are fake.
my buddies, Jeff and Hunter, they were messing with me, and I fell for it-- at least at first-- but, uh, no, these are a joke at my expense.
a joke?
that young lady's dead. This ain't no joke.
I'm, uh, I'm telling you that these are not real pictures.
she's not dead. You can ask her. She'll tell you.
well, she already told me from the autopsy table.
she's really dead?
as dead as it gets.
that's why you're here, Scott.
if Jeff and Hunter killed her and you know something, well, you better talk to me or you're going down with them.
look, it was my idea to come to Vegas.
the last time we were here, we did all these things on a dare.
Yeah, yeah, like, uh, steal Caesar's chariot and ride down the Strip.
I was a kid. It was a dumb thing to do. I got busted.
and I still had the dare list from ten years ago.
and I thought it would be fun to do it again.
this is so lame, dude. I can't believe we did this.
Nah, it just needs a little work.
hunter's a magazine editor.
it's his job to edit and spice things up. That's what he did.
a game?! Grand theft auto? Stealing from a casino? Kidnapping? Murder?
what do you get when you win this game?
nothing. Well, I mean, everything.
a free weekend in Vegas-- loser pays.
in this case, Scott. He picked up the tab for all of you.
as smart as Scott is, it never ceases to amaze me how easy it is to mess with him.
I mean, the guy's a loser. He's always been a loser.
but he's our loser.
even when we were kids. Back then, his dad was loaded.
then Scott struck it rich a couple years ago with this software app.
so what are you saying-- this whole thing was just a setup for your loser pal to pay for your weekend?
and have a little fun at his expense.
it was going great until we had a little rules dispute.
Scott was pissed.
said we cheated because we teamed up, instead of playing on our own.
you rolled a greeter in a men's room, and you call this stealing from a casino?
I'm sorry. You're an embarrassment.
it's just sad.
I was following the rules.
Yeah, and before that, you tipped a valet so you could drive some jerk's Ferrari around the block.
we frickin' kidnapped Carrot Top!
give it up, Poindexter. Your friends won.
Scott said he was through with the game, but we told him there was one more dare left on the list.
kill a hooker.
no. We just made it look like we did.
ready?
okay.
really. Get down. Put your arm right over-- aw, that's perfect.
okay.
we paid Amber to lure Carrot Top, so we figured, for a few bucks more, she'd play dead.
I mean, hell, she even thought it was funny.
and then you sent the photo to your buddy Scott.
bet he freaked out.
understatement.
here's what I don't understand. Why'd you go back the next night and kill Amber?
you already won.
we didn't kill her.
well, at least...well, at least, I didn't kill her.
well, somebody did.
and then they posted your fake photo on some Web site for psychologically disturbed individuals.
I swear I don't know anything about that.
the only thing we did with that photo was e-mail it to Scott.
are you sure about that?
because you and your buddies were the only ones who had the photo.
Oh, no.
amber.
she wanted a copy.
I e-mailed the photo to her.
I told Hunter not to give it to her.
chick said she wanted to show her boyfriend. Said it was the easiest two grand she ever made.
her boyfriend? Does he have a name?
I think it was... Greg or Craig. Something like that.
where did you drop Amber off?
where we met her.
at the hotel bar.
Yeah, I know this guy. He's at the tables every single night.
you know what he is? He's a cheap bastard.
win or lose, the guy never tips.
seen him lately?
Yeah, that's his usual table.
let's go. You've been killing me all night, Ty. Let's go!
good luck.
yeah-- 18. I'll take it.
is this how you mourn the loss of your girlfriend?
not now. All right, guys? I'm working.
no, you're all done. You're all done, Cool Hand.
you're coming with me. Let's go downtown.
downtown? - Yeah.
I don't think so, okay? I'm doubling down here. It's a big hand.
you're doubling down?
color him out.
my chips!
I got this. Don't worry about it.
this is from Amber.
take it all.
Hey, Denny.
is your brother around?
Hey, Doyle!
your buddy's back.
Hey, Crime Lab Man!
nice bike.
Oh, you think so?
want to ask you about a refund.
refund?
I didn't sell it to you.
no, but you sold the parts to the guy who made this Frankenstein.
which means that you knew that this motorcycle and its dead rider were involved in that bus wreck, and you didn't report it.
that's evidence tampering.
come on now, hoss.
I'm just trying to make a living here, man. If I sell a few extra parts on the side, what's the harm?
the man's already dead.
well, thanks to you, nobody knew that.
well... I'm sure we can work something out.
what kind of refund would make you look the other way?
it's not going to cost you any money.
no, but it'll cost you six months in County.
you're both under arrest for obstruction of justice.
I got to know.
how'd you figure it out?
I followed the evidence.
where you saw some scrap and some quick cash, I saw a man who needed to be spoken for.
your brother's the one who gave me the tip.
you got this.
what about your bike?
Oh, keep it. It's evidence.
I'm done with the open road.
you got nothing.
these are Amber's bank records.
you cleaned her out after she died.
Yeah. Well, what's hers is mine, okay?
that's love, buddy.
no, sir. This here is motive.
now, the staff at the Luxor tells me that you drop a couple of g's there every other day.
is that why you forced your girlfriend to start hooking again?
Hey, I did not force her, okay? She did it on her own. She wanted to do it, you know?
Hey, what do they say-- "once a whore, always a whore.
Wow. Wow, you know, you're a real gentleman.
thank you.
I think she wanted to leave you, but you wouldn't let her.
she showed you that phony photo of her own death.
you just took it as an opportunity to really kill her.
you could just pin it on one of those Chi Town flunkies.
am I right? - No. No.
listen to me. Amber-- she loved me, okay?
everything she did, she did it for me.
you know, on the night she died, she called me, okay? Earlier in the night.
she said she came into some green, some cash-- five grand and...
I had kind of a rough night at the tables that night, so...
what was I gonna do?
she said she'd put it in my account.
Hey, call the Luxor, okay?
I was there, all night long-- losing.
five grand, huh?
how many tricks did she have to turn to make that kind of money?
one.
guy's little head was doing all the thinking for him.
you know, he even told her he would give her another five g's after he was done.
idiot.
and who was this guy?
he's one of those guys-- Chi Town flunkies.
how did she get you that much cash in the middle of the night?
you ever hear of an ATM?
they scan cash now.
bank traced Amber's $5, 000 deposit to this ATM.
and if one of our Chicago boys gave her the money, his prints may still be on it.
the last cash deposit was for $1, 200.
cash deposit for $1, 500.
another cash deposit for $280.
that's $5, 000.
we found your prints on the cash you gave Amber Rowe.
right before you killed her.
what happened?
tired of being the loser?
tired of being the brunt of your friends' jokes?
check your e-mail.
told you, bro.
game's over when we say it's over.
you lose. Again.
you... You killed the girl for a bet?
man up.
you got bills to pay.
by the way, we drained the minibar.
I thought they really did it.
I wanted to call the cops a hundred times, but I was scared.
the minute I make that call, my life is over. Whether I killed her or not, I'm a part of it.
tried to drink it all away.
or maybe tried to get up the courage to do the right thing.
and then she walked in.
you're friends with the guys.
Yup. Uh, you know, I,uh... I fell for it.
come on, you can't be that stupid.
she told me she was in on the whole thing.
when I told her that I really thought she was dead...she just started laughing.
she said she couldn't believe that I was so stupid.
I could take that from the guys, but not from some whore.
that's when I figured it out.
a way to wipe the smiles off all their faces.
I offered her ten grand for another photo shoot.
in all those years...I know it's sick, but...
it felt so good...to one-up them.
after I killed Amber, I uploaded the staged photo-- their photo-- to that Vegas Web site, and I killed their hooker.
on the plane home, I was going to tell them that I did it, but they were on the hook for it.
I won.
I was finally the one calling the shots.
I was The Man.
and-and what's that like, being The Man?
so your friends are gonna go to jail for misdemeanor.
you're going to go to prison for murder one.
I guess that's a win.
there you go.
what are you doing? You won the bet.
no. No, all bets are off. Nobody wins here.
yo, Gossip Girl! Slow down!
who'd you piss off now? - Not now, Jake.
well, if you're looking for our girlfriend, okay, you just missed her.
aren't you Brooke Cassidy?
that's me.
so, you really a virgin?
screw you!
you forgot your number.
I could be your first time!
drink, drink, drink, drink, drink!
how did I let you get me into this?
come on! Drink, drink!
ladies, got a room upstairs.
get off of me!
babe.
uh, you find your little, uh, BFF?
Oh, let it go.
I'm sorry, I meant GBF. Gay Best Friend.
stop!
I'm so left my purity ring in my room. You want to come help me look for it?
Bye.
we're trending!
so, a series of 911 calls me in just after 4: 00 a. m.
dead body.
an anonymous tip gave us the location.
who invited the campus?
I know, they keep coming. It's like moths to a flame.
anyway, this place is notorious.
it's called Finals Bridge.
32 feet down to a broken neck.
so a big suicide spot?
well, used to be till the university closed it down five years ago.
anyway, I got to get back to take statements from the first responders.
Hey, what do you got?
well, I got a beer bottle.
well, that's something.
still wet, so it's recent.
Yeah, and I got some sediment disturbances here on the ground.
and then up here... base of the lamppost.
two different sets of shoe prints here.
they're not distinct, but it looks to me like there might have been a struggle?
Yeah. Well, there's more... here... on the ledge.
doesn't look like he jumped.
maybe someone pushed this kid over the edge.
you okay?
Yeah. Nothing that a chiropractor can't fix.
five call-outs today.
not one died some place where I'm not risking my life.
Yeah, well it sounds like it's been a rough night for everybody, especially this guy.
and you can smell it. He's had more than just a couple of beers.
long night of partying. Things got out of hand.
student looky-loos say they last saw him at the Theta Delta party.
student I. D. says Pete Moyer, sophomore.
has he got a cell phone on him, Super Dave?
no, not on him.
college kid without a cell phone, that doesn't happen.
antemortem bruising on the face.
Yeah, from a fight maybe.
skull's crushed.
it's consistent with the fall.
Yeah, he didn't drop straight down.
trajectory says, he had some momentum when he came off the bridge.
suggests a push. Maybe it was from the same person that messed up his face.
what are you doing, taking candids of our crowd?
you never know if the suspect might return to the scene.
out of feelings of guilt?
maybe they want to enjoy the show.
Ah, person of interest.
Oh, yeah.
giving the girls trouble?
between school and basketball, I don't really have much time.
it's good to see you, Finn. - It's really good to see you.
and Dad said you two were working together again.
Yes, we are.
so when are we going to play tennis?
think you can finally beat me?
Ah, yeah, good luck with that, buddy.
how come you're not in class?
dad, it's 7: 00 a. m. Plus, everybody's talking about this.
Yeah. I noticed that.
how'd they get here so quickly?
um, it's trending. - What?
can I see that?
posted at 3: 57 a. m. User name Voyeur4U.
brass said the 911 started coming in after 4: 00.
that means this Voyuer4U guy knew about the body before the cops or anybody else.
so this guy could be our killer.
the dude wanted to post and boast.
just saying.
that is a good theory.
must run in the blood.
what can you tell me, Doc?
well, our young man's skull fracture was accompanied by a fracture to the C1 vertebrate.
severed the spinal cord.
injuries were debilitating and fatal.
what about the antemortem injuries?
well, besides the split lip and contusions, he suffered a fracture to the zygomatic arch.
also the nasal cartilage.
and there was blood in the nares, the nostrils.
he really took a beating.
contusions take around six hours to set.
he was killed around 4: 00 a. m. means he was assaulted around 10: 00 p. m.
and there were no defensive wounds.
the fight was one-sided.
somebody really had it in for this kid.
all right, so, the autopsy says that Pete Moyer got himself beaten up at about 10: 00 p. m.
we didn't find any blood on his clothes from a fight but, Nick and Greg did find bloody clothes in his dorm room.
and apart from the clothes, the room was completely empty.
what do you mean?
apparently, a bunch of students went in there and helped themselves to his stuff.
you're kidding me. - Yeah. Isn't that disgusting?
so, Pete, last night, gets into a fight, goes back to his dorm room, changes his clothes and then he goes the Theta Delta party.
Yeah, where, maybe, he ran into the guy that he had the fight with, and then the fight continues, and ends on the bridge.
okay, so... sounds like we need to know more about this party.
Oh, yeah, what about this Voyuer4U guy who posted the photo?
Yeah, Archie's working on it right now.
Yeah, please, make yourself a home.
thank you.
Hey, Archie. What do you got?
running an ISP trace on Voyeur4U. Still waiting.
are these from the Theta party?
Yeah. Going through all the posted photos looking for Pete.
no luck yet, but, uh, still got another 1, 367 photos to go.
Oh, great.
what do you have?
Pete Moyer's FriendAgenda page.
this guy lived out loud in more ways than one -- openly gay, and he didn't pull any punches when it came to his feelings about others.
what do you mean? - He kept a VLOG.
video blog.
kind of like a campus version of Perez Hilton.
Pete posted juicy gossip about everybody on campus.
everything from who's sleeping with whom, to whose spring break was more like spring rehab.
okay, so sounds like this guy made a lot of enemies, right?
Oh, yeah, one in particular -- username Jonesin4.
comments are full of homophobic slurs.
some of 'em are kind of violent.
like this one, posted last night.
Hey, Queer. Stop gossiping and meet up with me, if you're man enough. Or I'll find you.
maybe this is a hate crime.
Hey, guys. We got a hit on Voyeur4U.
who is it?
Pete Moyer's account.
his death shot was posted from his own phone.
we didn't find his cell phone at the scene.
maybe the killer picked it up, you know. He might still have it.
track the cell's GPS.
already on it.
WLVU campus, Vincer Hall. That dorm has five floors.
and I can track the current altitude of that cell phone.
you're kidding me.
2, 061 feet above sea level.
so, in Vegas, that's about 27 feet above ground. I'd say that's the third floor.
Hey, Nick. Are you and Greg still on campus? - Yes, sir.
Yeah, we have a location on Pete Moyer's phone.
room's clear. Next one.
LVPD! Open up!
get in there, Vaughn.
don't leave out that window!
get your hands off me!
why you running, dude?
resisting arrest -- not cool.
that must be Jonesin4.
I think I know for what.
whatever you're jonesing for, this guy's got it.
Hey, try the number.
Pete's phone.
so you think this guy's Pete's killer?
I think we have a strong connection.
you guys got this so wrong.
Hey, Queer. Stop gossiping and meet up with me if you're man enough. Or I'll find you.
now, it sounds to me like we've got it right.
you had it in for Pete. So is that your thing -- you like to gay-bash?
the last person who'd bash Pete for being gay is me.
Really?
why is that? - Because I'm gay.
Hey, Queer" and all that -- it's just the way we talk to each other.
it's kind of an "us" versus "you" thing.
well, we have evidence that suggests a "you" versus "Pete" thing on the bridge last night.
we found a beer bottle with your DNA on it in the exact spot where somebody pushed Pete to his death.
look, I didn't kill Pete.
okay, you were on the bridge -- at least give me that much.
Yeah, I admit that, I was on the bridge.
but only because he texted me.
he said he needed help.
someone had done a number on him.
figured he was in trouble.
by the time I got there he was dead.
whatever happened on that bridge, I was too late.
Yeah, well, you're a really good friend, man.
you find him dead, you take his phone, you take his picture, and you post it to the Internet?
Yeah, what, did you forget to call 911?
I called. When I got back to my room.
I told you where to find his body.
posting that photo is what Pete would've wanted.
what's that supposed to mean?
trend To The End.
all right, well, let's say that you were just the photographer, who do you suppose had it in for Pete?
don't know who. Might know why.
it's all about the "scan-dahl."
what scandal?
Pete wouldn't tell me.
but he had some campus dirt that he was going to dish.
total TMZ.
love me, hate me.
but you know that I live by one rule: privacy is history.
the eye in the sky sees all, shares all.
now, if you can't own it, don't do it.
now, sometimes this means making hard calls, hurting people close to you, but I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't tell all.
and this bomb that I'm about to drop... it's gonna blow you away.
got this off Pete's phone.
thinking it was going to be his latest VLOG entry.
or whatever his tell-all was.
I think I know what it could have been about.
I found these pictures of Pete talking to Brooke Cassidy, the actress.
Oh, more than an actress.
Brooke Cassidy is an industry.
kids love her; parents love her even more.
Yeah. No sex, no drugs.
america's favorite virgin.
tough act to keep up in college.
Yes, and maybe she didn't, and maybe Pete found out.
and here he is, giving her the heads-up.
before he drops the bomb.
excuse me, Ms. Cassidy. We're from the Crime Lab.
this is CSI Brody. I'm CSI Finlay.
we're investigating Pete Moyer's death.
it's an awful thing. - Yeah.
Yeah, it is. And according to Pete's VLOG, you guys were pretty good friends.
Yeah, that's right.
according to photos posted from the Theta party, you were one of the last people to see him.
I guess so.
what exactly can you tell us about his state of mind?
I don't know. Pete was Pete.
what does that mean?
a hot mess. Opinionated.
he could be cruel sometimes.
was he ever cruel to you?
it seems like everybody wants to get ahead, so they'll say whatever they want about me, even if it's a total lie.
I came here to be a student, and I thought that Pete respected that.
and that would be important to a woman who had made a very public pledge of purity until marriage.
what are you implying?
we would just like to know what the two of you were talking about before someone pushed Pete off the bridge.
whatever it was, you don't look happy.
okay, I don't like where this is going.
I don't either.
and you are?
Jake Pychan, Theta Delta Zeta president.
are these people giving you a hard time?
no. They're just asking questions about Pete.
Oh, I can tell you all you need to know.
Oh, great.
Pete Moyer was a leech.
a nobody who tried to be a somebody by posting lies.
I warned Brooke about him.
I can see you're very protective, Mr. President.
and busy. I got a class to get to. So does Brooke.
is that everything from Pete's room?
almost. Still haven't got his computer yet.
Oh, look at that.
nice to see some things never change.
instant ramen! And a Crock-Pot. Good times.
the kid had all kinds of electronica. Cameras and microphones...listening devices.
took this whole paparazzi thing pretty seriously.
Yeah. Like, A-plus seriously.
Pete wrote a term paper here called "Phone Hacking for Hacks."
it's like a how-to guide.
phone hacking for credit?
what kind of class teaches that?
anthropology of Fame. Taught by Professor Tom Laudner.
Tom Laudner? I know that guy.
he has a tabloid TV show called Celebrities Indisposed.
he earns his living harassing celebrities.
and now he's teaching our kids, right?
the Scarlet Letter.
I like to think of Hester as the first bad girl gone viral.
but that was then. This... is now.
today, the scarlet letter -- it gets you a book deal, it gets you a product line, it gets you a reality show.
fame is good.
but... without the judgment of the church or the community, what's left to keep us in line?
gossip, fear, ridicule, shame.
gossip is good.
gossip works... for society.
that was a great lecture.
professor Laudner, right?
Mmm, yes. Well, I'm glad you could make it.
uh, the police, right? - Uh... CSI. D. B. Russell.
Oh, nice to meet you. - Yeah. You, too.
I presume this is about Pete Moyer, yeah?
Yeah, yeah. He was one of your students, right?
he was my best student.
Yeah, I could tell that. You know, I saw some of his course work.
especially that paper on phone hacking.
that was a good one.
well, maybe not so good for Pete.
see, I think he may have tried to hack the wrong phone.
well, I mean, I couldn't tell you anything about that. - No.
well...I mean this is a classroom and, you know, we just try to create a safe environment for students to pursue their intellectual muse.
Oh, I'm confused. I thought you taught a class on gossip.
Oh, no, no, no, no-- I teach a course on the sociology of celebrity; the culture of idolatry.
I mean, college is to prepare students for the real world, right?
the campus is a microcosm for society -
you got the haves, you got the have-nots, you've got the beautiful people, and the, uh...
you know, not-so-beautiful people.
and you got a real world actress playing student too, right?
Yeah. Brooke Cassidy? Fabulous girl.
Yeah, she was kind enough to serve as an object lesson in one of my lectures.
that was kind of her. 'Cause the way I hear it, she's, like, this scandal waiting to happen.
Yeah. Teen Dream deflowered.
it'd obviously make a good story.
Hey, did you have Pete try to hack into some of that?
Pete? No, no, no, no. He's one of my students, he's not one of my employees.
right. Right, right, right.
listen, what I can tell you about Pete... as "out" as he was, he kept a few things in the closet.
that's as close as you'll get to an exclusive from me.
I hope you return the favor.
Oh, hey, thank you so much. That was very helpful.
no, no, no, thank you. Nice to meet you, sir.
Yeah, you, too.
take care. Good luck.
Thanks.
what are we looking for exactly?
Oh, you know, something besides a computer or a hard drive where Pete could've stored whatever dirt he dug up on Brooke Cassidy.
you sure the professor's not just messing with you?
he was pretty clear about the quid pro quo.
I think I... may have just found the quid.
I got to get me one of those.
flash drive.
let's check it out.
let's see what's in Brooke's folder.
okay, so Pete wasn't just hacking messages. He was hacking into e-mails and photos.
america's favorite virgin's looking pretty virginal.
there's nothing really controversial here.
let's check Jake's file.
okay, wait a minute now.
I've seen that tatt before. - Where?
climbing out a window at WLVU.
that's Sebastian Jones. One of Pete Moyer's buddies.
looks like he's got another buddy.
that's Brooke's boyfriend, Jake Pychan.
looks like boyfriend's got a beard.
where did you get these?
not off the computer you stole from Pete Moyer's dorm room, if that's what you mean.
we found his computer under your bed.
those photos were on a flash drive that Pete hid in some dirty clothes.
but you didn't think to look there.
and they came from your phone. Which Pete hacked into.
son of a bitch.
I guess you didn't take that same purity pledge as your girlfriend.
that isn't sex.
Oh, I don't think your girlfriend would agree.
does she know you're gay? - I'm not gay.
gay, straight, your business, or at least it was your business right up until Pete decided to make it everyone else's.
and then you threw him off the bridge.
I didn't touch him.
when I saw him last night at the Theta house, somebody already worked him over pretty good.
well, then, you won't mind giving us your prints and some DNA?
I have rights.
Yeah, you got rights, but you're a suspect in a murder case.
and we don't have a lot of time, so tell us what happened.
Sebastian texted me after Pete was dead.
he said... Pete might have some photos of us.
Sebastian already had his phone, so I went for his computer.
I just didn't want them getting online. People wouldn't understand.
well, then, give us what we need, you know, help us rule you out as a suspect, and if you do, I promise that these photos will get buried in the evidence vault.
we can do that, can't we?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, there you go.
thank you.
why does a gossip hound need military-grade encryption for his computer files?
well, certainly not 'cause he respected anyone's privacy.
probably just didn't want to get scooped himself.
so, how long till you can unscramble it?
this is complicated. I'm gonna need some time.
when I said Pete was taking his paparazzi work seriously, I didn't realize he went full-tilt P. I.
must have dropped a mint at some spy store.
what is that?
a remote digital receiver.
Oh, that's top of the line.
still receiving a signal.
that's a live feed from a camera...mounted somewhere.
maybe an office?
this picture's fuzzy 'cause we're at the edge of the camera's broadcast range.
Pete Moyer's entire world is WLVU.
I guarantee you this room is somewhere on campus.
can you get me a better picture at all?
no. You guys should just start walking this thing back towards campus.
or I could try and do my job, amplify the reception range and get a cleaner image.
that's a good idea.
second.
mom insisted. She's worried you're not taking care of yourself.
come on in.
case must be going well.
hear you have a suspect in custody.
you're trending.
I'll be darned. So, it's like the court of public opinion in the digital age, right?
Yeah.
what... What do you...what you got there? Are those salt and vinegar chips.
it's nice to see Finn.
Yeah.
how's that working for you?
it's fine. Why do you ask?
just kind of a drag last time.
well, second time's a charm.
Yeah, hope so.
mom's not the only one who worries.
Finn? - Morgan, did you bring lunch?
we have company.
um, have a seat.
thank you.
I didn't want to be seen walking into the police department, so, I thought I could talk to you guys instead?
sure. Of course you can.
I know Jake's been arrested, but he had nothing to do with Pete's death.
Really? And why are you so sure about that?
because I was with him... all night.
all night?
Yeah, at the party and at the bridge with everyone else, after you guys found Pete.
you don't have to have sex to spend the night with someone.
no. No, you don't, and I'm sure it's easier to keep your pledge of purity when your boyfriend's not that into you.
look, I'm not naive.
when I met Jake, I really liked him.
you know, he was the perfect boyfriend for me.
sexually confused enough that he would never pressure me to break my vow, which, believe it or not, is very important to me.
uh, Brooke, we have evidence that Pete knew about Jake's sexual confusion, and may have been planning to out him.
is that why you and Pete were fighting at the party?
we weren't fighting at the party.
no, it had nothing to do with Jake.
Pete was venting about Professor Laudner.
professor Laudner? Why?
because Laudner's a douche.
and Pete idolized him, wanted to be just like him.
I don't know what went down between those two, but Pete told me I was right all along.
did he mention a physical altercation that took place with Professor Laudner?
I asked him why his face was all messed up, and he told me to check his next VLOG.
that the truth would be revealed.
Hey, Greg.
I tried boosting the reception from Pete's camera, but, uh, the image didn't get much better.
so, I enhanced this one area here.
looks like a poster.
Yeah, for Celebrities Indisposed.
Pete's camera is in Tom Laudner's office.
there's the poster. Camera's got to be somewhere over there.
Yeah.
bookcase is a good place to hide a camera.
think I got something on the top shelf.
here it is.
and that's what it's looking at.
Yeah, well, there's only one reason why Pete Moyer would want a bird's-eye view of Professor Laudner's couch.
Ah, Professor. Thanks for coming down.
didn't seem like I had a choice.
you didn't.
sit down, please.
I have something that I want to show you.
Really?
that's my office.
do you have a warrant?
actually, that's university property. And yeah, they've been served.
but you don't have probable cause for any wiretapping or surveillance.
that's true, that's true, we don't.
you see, Pete Moyer put that camera in your office.
he's the one who's been watching you.
got a blood drop.
Yep. Somebody cleaned up this rug.
if that's Pete Moyer's blood, then he was beaten in this room.
so, Pete was in your office last night, and the two of you got into a fight.
Yeah. That's none of your business.
you're pulling the privacy card.
after you made a career out of exposing everyone else's business.
that's a little hypocritical, don't you think?
guilty.
do you have anything else?
Yeah, actually I do. Thank you.
I have blood... on your rug.
see, you tried to clean it up, which makes it my business.
Oh, this thing had quite a workout.
Yeah. Maybe one of Laudner's students was riding the extra credit couch.
your office hours must be very stimulating.
I'm sorry. Did I miss the question?
how many women are enrolled in your Anthropology of Fame class? - Thirty-eight.
and how many have you had sex with?
okay, here's what I think happened.
I think Pete Moyer found out, confirmed it with his camera, and then threatened to expose you.
Mr. Russell, even gossip is woven with a thread of truth.
then I think that you tried to rough him up a little bit, but when that didn't work, I think you lured him out to Finals Bridge.
what, and pushed him off?
you thought it would look like a suicide.
you panicked, you thought that the scandal would ruin you.
are you serious?
teacher sleeps with students, none of them underage, not the same sex, and all of them consensual.
what scandal?
Hey, Nick? Come here for a second, will you?
Yeah.
I hate it when a suspect blows a hole in a perfectly good theory.
professor Laudner.
okay, okay, now, so what if Pete Moyer recorded the professor having sex -- consensual sex -- with a student?
seven different students.
according to the vaginal contributions on the couch, he was a busy man.
but that just makes him the guy who can. It doesn't make him a killer.
and like he said in his dumb lectures, sex scandal nowadays just means that you got yourself a book tour, a reality show, and a movie deal, for crying out loud.
you're not really letting this guy get to you, are you?
that's beside the point.
what I don't see is a motive for killing Pete.
we know he punched him.
we confirmed it was Pete's blood in Laudner's office.
okay, but if... if the fight wasn't about a sex scandal, then what was it?
you never know what you're gonna see when you turn a camera on.
or what people are gonna do.
maybe Pete saw something more than sex.
maybe Pete saw something Laudner didn't want him to.
I wouldn't put it past Laudner to take advantage of his students, would you?
and maybe not take no for an answer.
maybe.
I like that.
okay, we need to identify these seven women.
you see the cops take him away? - Yeah.
so it's got to be true, right? Professor Laudner's been arrested?
good afternoon, class.
my name is Julie Finlay, and this is Morgan Brody.
we work with the Crime Lab.
we are here investigating the death of Pete Moyer.
we are going to share details with you regarding our homicide investigation.
now, this information has been withheld from the public.
we discovered epithelials, skin cell DNA, under the victim's fingernails, which tells us that he struggled with his killer in the moments before his death.
the way this works, we start by trying to exclude Pete's classmates and friends, in order to zero in on our killer.
now, in order to do that, we need to collect DNA samples from all of you.
what if we refuse?
well, you do have that legal right -- this is strictly voluntary -
but I would like to ask you all to refrain from spreading false rumors about any classmates who refuse to cooperate.
so no sharing, no posting, no kidding.
first volunteers get the clean swabs.
I can't believe that just worked.
Hey, Nick.
I identified the seven vaginal contributors from the couch in Professor Laudner's office.
all these girls were in his class.
all right, I'll have Brass bring them in.
well, Professor Laudner's office hours are open to every student in the class, so...
are you asking me if I had sex with Professor Laudner?
I'm asking you if it was consensual.
I took Laudner's class for an easy "A.
everybody knows that if you're a pretty girl, wear a short skirt and sit in the front row, you get an "A.
did he promise if you slept with him he'd give you an "A"?
he never made any promises, but... it was understood.
Ashley, we've collected forensic evidence, and we're talking to other girls.
we know that Professor Laudner offered sex for grades.
I am not accusing you of anything.
I just would like to ask if you had consensual sex with Professor Laudner.
did Professor Laudner hurt you?
I don't want to talk about it.
Ashley, I know you want to help us find Pete's killer.
I think Pete found out about what happened to you, and then he tried to help you.
Pete did not want to help me.
Pete only cared about Pete and his damn gossip!
I didn't want to talk to Pete, and I don't want to talk to you.
I have a right to be left alone.
Ashley, I understand that... but what Pete found out cost him his life, so I need you to help me find out what happened to him, and I need you to let me help you.
you can't help me! No one can!
I would like to try.
I killed Pete! Okay?
I was the reason he was at that bridge! I pushed him off!
can you help me now?
get off me! Please!
finally decrypted Pete's hard drive. Been through all the videos.
a lot of sex, but... nothing like this.
that is so clearly rape. Why wouldn't Ashley have reported it?
a lot of shame associated with sexual assault.
especially if the rapist is known to the victim.
so, Mandy matched three unknown sets of prints from the bridge to the ten-card that Finlay collected from Ashley Benson.
so she was there?
Yeah. The problem is, there's an inconsistency with her confession.
mind if I get in there?
so... all of her prints are on... this lamppost.
the first set is at approximately five feet. The highest is a little over eight.
well, Ashley's about my height, so...
here's your first set of prints.
okay. Add what, 18 inches for the bench?
there's your second set of prints.
well, another 18 inches, and you're at eight feet.
looks like you might need a little help to get there.
Ashley was climbing.
Yep. Right onto the ledge.
Pete followed me to the bridge...
ambushed me as I was leaving the party.
he said he knew what Laudner had done to me and he'd seen it with his own eyes.
so he... told you about the tape?
Yeah, he said he was gonna post it on his Web site and that he wanted my exclusive.
I knew the rumors.
I knew that some of the girls were sleeping with him.
but I'm not like that.
I should have taken the "C.
I was trying so hard to get into business school, and...
Ashley, you did nothing wrong; nothing.
have you seen it?
the tape is evidence.
so it's gonna be everywhere.
I need you to tell me what happened.
I... I thought Pete was there because he actually cared about me.
look, forget my VLOG. I'll go with you to the cops; we'll talk to them together.
it doesn't matter! He raped me!
you don't have to do this.
he said we couldn't give up, and that I couldn't let Laudner win.
I want it to be over!
come here. Take my hand.
Hey, you have to trust me.
and then I turned around, and he had his phone out.
he was recording us, or-or texting, or tweeting, I don't know, but...
I knocked it out of his hand.
if I just hadn't gone into Laudner's office, Pete would still be alive!
Ashley, from what you're telling me, it was an accident.
it was not your fault. Okay?
none of this is your fault.
not Pete's death, and certainly not what Laudner did to you.
I lived with it for 13 days.
I went to class. I worked at my job.
I talked to my parents.
I just... I boxed it up, and I put it on a shelf.
Ashley, listen to me: I am gonna have experts testify to your behavior, so that when you take the stand, the jury will know why you went back to that class.
a jury?
I-I can't stand in front of a jury.
there is no hope of stopping Laudner if you don't.
that's not my problem. I just want to be left alone.
please.
you know I talked to the D. A. She's not gonna file on just the tape.
which means the guy walks.
Yeah, and the bastard's gonna go do it again to another girl.
we have to take our victims as they come.
Hey, Dad.
you look terrible. - Oh, thanks a lot.
were we supposed to be doing something?
no, but Mom thought it would be cool if we all met up for dinner.
Oh, that sounds fun.
something wrong?
well, some cases don't end up the way you want them to.
Yeah, but this one did, right? - No.
Really? Check it out.
it's all over the Internet -- Professor Laudner raped a student.
news travels fast, doesn't it?
the university suspended him. - What?
I mean, look at all these posts.
it's not like he's gonna get away with it.
Yeah.
so... this is what you call trending, right?
let's go meet your mother.
is Uncle Steve gonna be okay?
Molly, your Uncle Steve...something bad happened to him.
he's not going to wake up.
like my goldfish?
mommy flushed him down the toilet when he stopped swimming.
that's how he got to Heaven.
Molly, do you know where your mommy is?
no.
when's she coming back? I'm gonna be late for school.
Molly, I... I've got to talk to my friend, here.
but I'll be right back.
Maria's going to stay with you, all right?
Thanks.
Hi, Molly.
three male DBs inside the house. They all had I. D.'s.
Finn's processing.
of course, she wanted the scene first.
little girl able to tell you anything?
last name's Goodwin.
she and her mother Grace live here along with Grace's brother, Uncle Steve.
he was one of the victims, along with what appears to be two friends.
what about her father?
I don't know. She didn't say.
all she told me was she woke up, went into the living room.
that's when she called 911, then waited outside for the police.
most kids would've run out of there screaming.
there's one more thing.
the little girl's mother is missing.
okay. All right.
looks like the party was interrupted.
savage beating.
poor kid.
had to wake up and find this.
home invasion robbery.
all this, for a few hundred dollars worth of stereo components? I'm not so sure.
well, this room tells one story.
kitchen tells another.
got a purse. Haven't gone through it yet.
grace Goodwin. Little girl's mom.
her phone's still here, but her car keys are missing.
our killer might have taken her in her own car.
I'll get Brass to put out a broadcast.
blood says there was definitely a struggle.
she must've walked in on them.
she was probably dragged along the floor.
not enough blood for her to have bled out, right?
she might still be alive.
but for how long?
let's hope long enough, for her sake.
and for that little girl out there.
please, I need to get through. Excuse me, this is my home.
excuse me. What are you doing here?
sorry, ma'am. I can't let you through.
let me through? This is...This is my house.
my grandkids are in there! Please!
I understand.
take your hands off of me!
Mitch? Mitch, thanks. I've got this.
I don't understand what's going on here.
let me talk to you for a second.
my name's D. B. Russell. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
crime Lab?!
Yes, ma'am. And-and you're Mrs...?
Goodwin. Agnes Goodwin.
you said that that's your home over there?
Yes. My grandkids, Steven and Grace, they need a place to stay, so I-I rent it to them.
and Grace has a little girl. My great-granddaughter.
Molly. - That's right.
Oh...oh, no, what's happened?
Mrs. Goodwin, I'm so sorry, but your grandson Steven and-and two other young men were victims of an apparent homicide.
a homicide?
your granddaughter is unaccounted for. We're looking for her right now.
Molly's safe. We've taken her to Desert Palm Hospital.
let me ask you one more thing.
I'm-I'm so sorry, but... what about Molly's father?
he died in Iraq, uh... before Molly was born.
I need to see her. - Yes, of course.
and I...I need to call my son right now.
I don't understand what's happening. I just saw them all here yesterday.
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
I can't...where's my phone?
well, there's definitely signs of forced entry.
what's the web telling you?
angle and elevation...the victims were definitely on their knees before the beatings started.
duct-taped wrists and ankles...and the front door lock was picked.
what are you thinking?
well, I'm thinking I've seen this before.
day shift has been investigating a series of home invasions in this area.
does this have the same M.O?
aside from the escalation to murder, yes.
woman was abducted.
what happened to her?
sexually assaulted and released.
so maybe we will find Grace Goodwin alive.
I hope so, but it's gonna be tough.
and look, at the other break-in, there were witnesses.
said they saw three guys with masks.
no witnesses here.
I'm not so sure about that.
let me show you something.
this blood is gravitational.
connects to the blood evidence in the kitchen.
blood from the little girl's mom.
but this blood is directional.
after Grace was struck, she headed down this hallway.
doesn't make sense. No way to escape down there.
exactly. Grace knew that.
she knew her only chance to get away was to go out back through the kitchen.
okay, what drew her attention down the hallway?
first door on the right is Molly's room.
but Grace never ran down there.
no. She stopped.
I think, to give a signal to her daughter to stay inside her room.
little girl said she was asleep the whole time.
I think she saw more than she's saying.
Maria...let me have a minute, will you?
thank you.
how you doing, Molly?
I remember you.
well, my name is D. B.
well, that's...not really my name. That's what people call me.
do you want to know what my real name is? Do you?
you gotta promise not to laugh, though.
promise?
my name is "Diebenkorn
I knew you were gonna laugh.
it's a funny name.
Yeah, it is a funny name.
I know you've been asking about your mommy. And we're looking for her.
Thanks.
Yeah. You're welcome.
last night...in the middle of the night, did-did you wake up?
did you see your mommy?
did you see the-the people who hurt your mommy?
can you read to me?
sure.
dream Away. Is this your favorite book?
it's Mommy's favorite.
excuse me, one second, here.
Greg SANDERS found car matches grace goodwin's. Possible body.
so patrol found Grace Goodwin's car.
Actually...they didn't.
same year, same model, but the license plate was unreadable, so I double-checked the VIN.
car's registered to a Burt Markell.
so we've got a new case.
Yeah. Let's pop the trunk.
that's, uh... Burt Markell, I presume.
there's a hole in his head-- gunshot, maybe?
gas can-- that would've helped fuel the fire.
so the guy gets shot in the head, dumped in the trunk, and then the car was lit up to destroy evidence.
let's just hope they didn't get all of it.
hello. I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
is there any news on Grace?
we haven't found your daughter yet, but I'm confident we will.
we've identified the deceased young men who were found at the scene with your son Steven as J. D. Kesey and Duke Givens.
did you know them?
no, I did-I didn't. Mom? Did you?
no.
we also found drug paraphernalia at the scene. Was Steven a drug user?
no, he was not a drug user. You're wrong about that.
no, Bruce...he's right. Steven did have a problem with drugs.
mom... You never told me.
well, he was doing better lately.
he was my son. I should've known about this.
steven asked me not to tell you.
What?!
I haven't been around for the past few years. - Really.
I had some...issues. And now...
Bruce, honey. I can't...
it's okay. It's okay, baby. It's okay.
when can I see my granddaughter Molly again?
very soon. We're just finishing processing her.
picked up exemplars from Burt Markell's apartment.
Henry confirmed he's our DB.
so, did you find a bullet in his head?
no, just a hole, and it's not from a gunshot.
it's blunt force trauma.
any idea what the weapon was?
it's hard to tell with all the fire damage, but the tissue on the outside of the wound was charred along with the tissue in the wound as well as the skull.
so he was struck in the head, thrown in the trunk of his car and then lit up?
I wish that were true. - What do you mean?
take a look at the trachea.
the tissues of the oropharynx and tracheobronchial tree were seared by fire.
so you're he inhaled fire.
not just inhaled. He swallowed it.
I found burn marks along the esophagus and inside the stomach wall.
so he was alive in the trunk when the car was torched.
the blow to the head didn't kill him, it just incapacitated him.
maybe the killer thought he was already dead.
or the sick bastard didn't care.
man on a mission.
you're gonna put day shift out of a job.
did Russell get anything from the little girl?
he said that she's still too freaked out to talk.
I think it's going to take some time.
the mother's still alive.
I don't know how much time we have.
you're still thinking that our crime fits the pattern of home invasion robberies.
in the previous home invasions, the suspects left behind prints, so I compared them against the prints we found in the Goodwin house -
they were all over the place.
pretty bad crooks.
pretty dead crooks, you mean.
how's that?
I was entering fingerprint exemplars from the victims in the house to exclude them, then two of them popped on AFIS.
J. D. Kesey and Duke Givens?
wait a minute-- you're saying that two of our victims are the home invaders?
what about the little girl's Uncle Steven?
guy's not in the system.
if he was involved, he didn't leave prints.
okay, so we need some new exemplars, DNA maybe.
what about the woman from the other home invasion who was sexually assaulted?
Yeah, this Alison Liss.
I'll compare our three guys against the semen recovered from the female vic.
see if one of them's a match.
Thanks.
so, our home invaders were home invaded?
with the same M.O. as the previous crimes.
this all sounds like payback to me.
Yeah, but upping the ante to murder.
Yeah, Jim.
Really? All right, I'm on my way.
what?
patrol just found Grace Goodwin.
what's the story, Mitch?
patrols canvassed the area. Found her body in there.
these people are animals, Nick.
and we're gonna hunt them down.
mommy's in Heaven, isn't she?
Yes, she is.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.
sweetheart, I feel the same way.
you know, as soon as there's break in this case,
I want to take a day off and fly up and see Katie and Maya; check up on them.
I think it's just gonna take some time, that's all.
okay, I gotta go. I love you, too. Bye-bye.
is everything okay?
Yeah, thanks. Everything's fine.
did you, uh, break the news to Molly?
I did; yeah, yeah.
okay, so where are we?
well, Grace Goodwin is on her way up to autopsy.
Nick said that she was really badly beaten.
so both of you think that the motive for all these murders is payback?
Yeah. I think that Steven Goodwin's friends, J.D. and Duke, robbed the wrong house and crossed the wrong person.
what about Steven?
well, I got the SAE kit back on the woman who was abducted and sexually assaulted during the fourth home invasion.
DNA from the semen not a match to Steven Goodwin.
he didn't commit the rape, so I don't think he was part of the crew.
I think that he and his sister Grace were collateral damage.
so, we have a third guy from this home invasion crew still out there.
and, if someone is taking revenge on those guys, he may be our next victim.
you know, I've seen it all, Doc, but sometimes... it gets to me.
worry when it doesn't.
so how'd she die?
well, as you can see, Grace Goodwin sustained multiple blows to the head.
C.O.D. was subdural hematoma.
blunt force injuries to the upper body, legs, arms.
contusions and bruisings are indicative of the same type of weapon used on her brother and the other two victims.
hexagonal pattern in these wounds.
I think we can guess what the weapon was.
lug wrench.
was she sexually assaulted?
no, she wasn't. Surprised?
well, the killer followed the same M.O. as the other invasions all the way down to the abduction.
but the woman before was raped.
and that's what's bothering you?
if this whole thing is some sort of payback.
it goes way beyond "you rob my house, I rob your house.
someone that's sending a message.
the way that they're doing it says a lot about how brutal they are.
this guy Burt must've really pissed somebody off.
what do we know about him?
uh, he worked at a golf course. Greenskeeper.
no wife, no kids.
I went to his place; he didn't have much.
gonna be hard to find anything probability in this wreckage.
that's strange.
white crystals embedded in the rim of the trunk, right above where we found the gas can.
you know, I swear I smell garlic.
looks like someone dropped something in here.
someone who works at the Palermo.
it's a casino I.D. badge.
the name and photo are burnt off.
if the RFID chip in it somehow survived the fire...
maybe we found our killer.
how long have you been standing there?
do you have any idea who she is?
no. Why?
two years ago, I bought a motorcycle.
you bought a motorcycle?
the point is, the previous owner was Sandy Larken's boyfriend, who died on the bike after they broke up, in a most unusual traffic mishap.
is Sandy Larkin involved in this most recent vehicular tragedy?
she's a person of interest.
interesting. I want in.
Oh, my God. I-I can't believe this.
y-you really think someone would do something to hurt Burt?
kill him. Burn him alive.
settle.
so, Miss Larkin, we found your I.D. in Burt's car.
do you have any idea how it got there?
Oh, we work together. Actually, I'm a concierge at the Palermo.
it's my job to shuttle high rollers to the Glenn Alden Golf Course.
Burt's a greenskeeper there.
we know.
I lost my badge last week.
I guess I must've dropped it in Burt's car, when he was giving me a ride home.
did Burt give you a ride home often?
Yes. We were seeing each other.
Oh, you were intimately involved.
he was a little odd, but I liked him.
when my dog got sick, he was really there for me, and I kissed him, and that's when we started dating.
when did you break up with him?
How...how did you know we broke up?
Oh, I know. I know about you.
Oh, that...that's right, we've met.
you were so sweet to me when Peter died in that horrible motorcycle accident.
I don't know what it is with me and guys. I have the worst luck.
so, why did you and Burt break up?
well, the truth is I liked Burt more as a friend.
I can't believe the last time we talked-- well, texted-- was when I dumped him.
and when was that?
two days ago.
miss Larkin, can you account for your whereabouts yesterday?
like, where I was? I was at my friend's salon.
she's learning how to do waxing and needed someone to practice on.
I got a free haircut, too.
I was there. Just ask.
Oh, we will.
looks like you've had some success here.
whoever wrapped Grace Goodwin's body in that tarp, left behind some pretty good fingerprints I'm running through the system right now.
Hey, uh, I think your wife's calling you there, boss man.
Yeah, I'll call her back later. Thank you.
you all right?
Yeah...My granddaughter's starting to have nightmares again.
about the whole McKeen kidnapping thing?
Yeah, yeah. It started right afterwards, but then it got better for a while, you know.
but a couple months ago, it...
it's always hard when kids are involved.
Yeah.
what you got?
Hello, Connor Durman.
that's a work card from the Spearmint Rhino.
now, that's interesting.
working on your payback theory,
I started looking for anyone who might've wanted revenge for Alison Liss's sexual assault.
pretty good suspect. This guy owns the Spearmint Rhino.
know him?
by reputation. Prostitution, drugs, all that good stuff.
Oh, well, allegedly.
he was also a suspect in the murder of an informant last year.
okay, what does all this have to do with Alison Liss?
she is Lash's niece.
the house she was renting belongs to him, so our home invasion crew not only messed with his property, they messed with his family.
and gave Lash a good reason to be out for blood.
maybe enough reason to send this Durman fellow to collect.
Hey, Jimmy!
crystal, how are you? - Good.
how you doing? Staying out of trouble?
it's more fun to be in trouble, you know that.
do you know this guy-- Connor Durman?
Yeah. Uh, he works the door.
don't think he's on tonight, though.
how about the big boss, Tony Lash?
he isn't here, either.
so no one's here tonight, huh?
wish I could help.
look, I'm up next.
I need your help.
Tony Lash isn't here, for real.
Connor is in the Champagne Room.
thank you.
uh, excuse me, ladies, I hate to interrupt your fun, but I need a word with Mr. Durman.
who the hell are you, huh?
I'm the cops.
what is this all about?
we'll talk about that downtown.
I don't think so, all right?
Oh, you don't think so?
I just paid 400 bucks for this bottle.
I got six more dances coming to me, so, you boys are gonna have to wait.
I really don't think so. I'm your new dance partner.
we found your fingerprints on the tarp that Grace Goodwin's body was wrapped up in.
that tarp was in the back of my truck. Somebody stole it last week.
I thought you were just the muscle that Tony Lash hired to kill the crew that raped and robbed his niece.
but then this lab report came up.
and the DNA showed that you raped Alison Liss.
so that means you were the third person in the home invasion crew.
if that's the case, why are you still alive when the other two guys are dead?
because when Tony Lash put the screws to you, you lied about the rape, and you dimed out your buddies to save your ass.
here's a chance to save your ass again.
give me Tony Lash.
I can't.
wrong answer!
I can't 'cause Lash ain't stupid, all right?
he's not the one who came to me and put a gun to my head.
who did?
this guy, uh...name's Dave. From Detroit.
he works for Lash.
and I told him what we did.
hell, we didn't know it was Lash's place, Lash's niece.
told him it was J. D. who, uh...raped Alison.
you are a piece of work, man.
well, he wanted to know where to find J. D.Duke, and made me take him to the house, and I swear to God, I did not even go inside there.
tell me about Grace Goodwin.
her took her in her car, and he had me follow them to this abandoned warehouse.
he took my tire iron and tarp, told me to get lost.
that's the last I saw of them.
where can I find this "Dave from Detroit"?
I don't know; I only saw him that one night.
news flash: your man-killer, Sandy Larken, her alibi checked out-- she was caught on tape.
there's surveillance in a beauty salon?
this is Vegas. The friend's salon is at the Fashion Arcade at the Tangiers.
are these my crystals from the car trunk?
yes-- tetraphosphorous decaoxide.
that's byproduct of phosphine gas and oxygen, right? - Right.
I don't get it. How does phosphine gas get in the trunk of Burt Markell's car?
source is usually phosphoric acid.
how it got in his trunk, total mystery.
not to me.
I just got the tox report back on Burt Markell.
showed high levels of zinc in his system.
like the supplement?
Yeah. But these levels were off the charts.
I have a theory, though, as to how Burt "zinc'd out.
you guys have seen Caddyshack, haven't you?
mole poison.
a greenskeeper's best friend.
a greenskeeper like our friend Burt Markell.
you think Burt was killed by mole poison?
the active ingredient in mole poison is zinc phosphide.
and when it comes into contact with potassium bicarbonate...
it creates phosphine gas.
and when that comes into contact with oxygen -
you may want to put those on for this -
creates a chemical reaction that is, well...the bomb.
smell the garlic?
Yeah.
and I see the white crystals-- tetraphosphorous decaoxide.
well, this is impressive, but we didn't find any mole poison in Burt's trunk.
well, that's because the mole poison wasn't in his trunk, it was in Burt.
wait-- he ingested mole poison? That would kill him.
I checked Burt's FriendAgenda page.
he and Sandy Larken had a volatile relationship.
and the day that Sandy broke up with him, he posted a virtual suicide note.
swallowing mole poison?
Yeah. And his stomach enzymes-- like the potassium bicarbonate
reacted with the poison to create the phosphine gas.
so Burt didn't swallow fire, he belched it.
think about it: Burt runs out of gas.
but being a greenskeeper, out of habit, he keeps an extra can of gas in his trunk.
the build-up of gas in his stomach causes Burt to burp.
causing the phosphine gas to ignite.
combine that with the can of gasoline, and Houston, we have a problem.
explains Burt's head injury, it explains the searing of his esophagus and stomach and the trachea, too.
if he was trying to kill himself, why did he get in his car and drive across town?
I think I know someone we need to talk to.
Really?
well, this time, I'm doing all the talking.
you cops keep coming around, I'm gonna insist you pay the cover.
well, we can always have this conversation at my place.
there's no cover charge and the drinks are free.
good night, ladies.
go on.
so, how can I help the LVPD today?
J. D. Kesey and Duke Givens.
what about 'em?
they're two-thirds of a trio that messed up your niece.
your boy Connor Durman gave up their names, and now they're dead.
I guess that's called karma.
I mean, considering what they did to poor little Alison.
we know you had them killed, Tony.
right. The same way you knew I had that informant killed a year ago.
come on, man, we've done this dance already.
I mean, if you had anything, anything at all on me, I wouldn't be sitting here, would I?
I hope you sleep okay, because you just killed two innocent people and orphaned a six-year-old girl.
guess what? I sleep just fine.
whoever you hired screwed up, Tony.
J. D. and Duke didn't rape Alison-- Connor did. He lied.
sleep on that.
I hope you got that phone tap in place. I just rattled Tony Lash's cage.
911. What's your emergency?
mommy told me to call.
where is your mommy? Is she hurt?
I don't know where she is. She told me to call if something happened.
my uncle Steven and his friends won't wake up.
what's your name, honey?
Molly, are your uncle and his friends hurt?
I have to go.
mommy said I should go wait outside for the police.
Molly, wait. Don't hang up, Molly.
how many times have you listened to that?
too many.
I heard about Katie.
Nick's really worried about you.
but I am, too.
when my kids were growing up, I-I coached 'em what to do in an emergency:
call 911, go to the neighbors. If they're not home, wait outside.
that's really good advice.
coming from a dad who's a cop, yeah.
I mean, we see tragedy every day; we come to expect it.
it's part of the job.
but my daughter Maya didn't want to raise Katie that way.
you know, didn't want her living in fear.
and now she is.
Yes, she is. Just like Molly.
trying not to show it; trying to be strong.
you know, something's not right here.
we-we've got a...we've got a revenge killing staged to look like a home invasion.
look at these photos.
only one part of the house has been touched, ransacked.
the area where the TV and the stereo are.
and the CDs and the DVDs.
it's not a very good "staging.
so you're thinking that whoever did this was looking for something.
Yeah, but I'm also thinking that Molly's mom coached her, just like I coached my kids.
but I'm a cop. I knew what threats in the world I was afraid of.
so what was Grace Goodwin afraid of?
right.
and what's our killer looking for?
we got missing pieces of this puzzle.
Oh, my God, Burt ate mole poison?
that is so...disgusting.
and fatal.
sorry.
thank you, I...I feel like you've brought me closure.
uh, actually, um...we are also in need of some closure, Miss Larken.
you said the last time that you communicated with Burt was three days ago-- that "Dear John" text.
his-his name's "Burt.
right. Uh, the point is that you dumped him, but that was not the last time that you communicated with him.
Yes, it was. - No, it wasn't.
you sent him a text an hour before he died.
no, I didn't.
we have the phone records, Sandy. Sh-She has the phone records.
Yes, I do.
you invited him to dinner.
I...I wondered why Tad didn't get my invite.
who's Tad? - My new boyfriend.
I...the text was meant for him, not Burt.
Oops.
Oops?
you-you send a man in the throes of a mole-poison suicide false hope, send him racing to the E. R. to get his stomach pumped for dinner, and-and-and all you can say is "Oops"?
he was on his way to the hospital?
we think so. His car was parked two blocks away.
I feel really bad.
of course you do.
no, I-I don't think I'm busy. I think we're just about done?
Yes.
I will be there in ten.
and I am so sorry. I was such a bitch to you about missing dinner.
you are not gonna believe this story.
I know what you're thinking.
she's a black widow.
and one day, I'm gonna prove it.
there you are.
I think your granddad'll be here in a second.
tell you what.
if you want anything, call this number, okay?
anytime, day or night.
you call and I answer.
you want me to read to you for a sec?
no.
mommy said if anything ever happened to her,
I should find a good person. Like you.
and give this to them.
grace, I want to be a part of your life.
no, Dad, you'll never be a part of my life. Or Molly's.
you know what you did. To me, and to Steven.
honey, I got help.
I'm a different man-- I want us to be a family again.
you're lucky you're not in prison.
if you come near me or Molly, I'll go straight to the cops.
I'll see you rot in jail.
that's Grace's dad's confession on tape, as far as I'm concerned.
this is what our killer was after.
but I'm confused.
I thought we were looking at Tony Lash for these murders.
I mean, we got a witness that puts one of Lash's guys in the house, doing the killings for him.
well, maybe he wasn't just killing for him.
maybe.
Hi, Bruce.
CSI Russell said you still had some questions for me.
what's your connection to Tony Lash?
who?
I-I mean, I don't know any Tony Lash.
what about Dave?
detroit Dave"? What about him?
what's this about?
what's that?
you really want to play it this way? Really?
cause I'll play with you. - I'm not playing!
I don't know what any of this is about!
that is your confession to molesting your own son and daughter.
grace recorded it, man.
this is some kind of trick.
trick? No, no, no. No tricks.
I don't know anything about any recording.
that disc is why you had them killed.
that disc is why you joined up with Tony Lash to beat and murder four people, including your own son and daughter.
No!
I loved my daughter! And my son!
I know I hurt them.
I know I did.
but that was a very long time ago.
I'm not that man anymore.
and all I wanted was the chance to prove it...have my family back together again.
well, that may have been what you wanted.
but that damn sure wasn't what Grace or Steven wanted.
there was no way in hell she was letting you go near Molly.
and I think that Grace wanted us to find that, so that even in death, she can bear witness against you.
it doesn't matter what you think.
my family is the most important thing to me.
I would die before I hurt them again.
I don't think he knew anything about that recording.
what about the murders?
don't think he knew anything about them, either.
okay, so, what do we got?
we have two of our victims-- J. D. and Duke, clearly connect to Tony Lash.
revenge killing for raping his niece.
and the other two-- Grace and Steven Goodwin-- to Bruce, to cover up for his past crimes.
but if Bruce didn't hook up with Lash to commit these murders, the question is who did?
just got off the phone with Brass.
the wiretap on Lash's phone just came through.
I guess Brass really did rattle his cage.
did he reach out to "Dave from Detroit"?
brass just found him with a bullet in his head.
so Dave's not talking.
no, but we got someone else was talking plenty on that wiretap to Lash.
turns out he's got a girlfriend, who, for once, is age appropriate.
packing up are you, Mrs. Goodwin?
Oh, yes, yes.
uh, your officers told me earlier that they had released the crime scene.
it's so hard, but it... it has to be done.
did you feel the same way about killing your grandkids?
excuse me?
you know, when I first heard about you and Tony Lash as a couple, I just, I didn't get it.
Yeah, he said that you two were high-school sweethearts; that you reconnected after all these years.
it was a really sweet story.
you got a lot of stuff to go through there, don't you?
I guess I could save her some time.
that is, if you're looking for a...a recording of your son's confession, I made you a copy for you.
actually, you know what, it's more for your lawyer.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
my grandchildren were beaten to death in this house.
how dare you accuse me!
Oh, we don't have to accuse you of anything.
you already took care of that yourself.
another little recording I want you to listen to.
damn it, Tony, they just arrested Bruce.
sooner or later the cops are going to figure out who did this.
calm down, Agnes.
calm down?!
they're never gonna connect this to us.
they're going to find out we're together;
that I got you to kill my grandkids while you were taking your revenge on those two thugs.
boy, your family has a bad habit of getting caught confessing on tape. Don't you think?
I get Tony, revenge killing.
but you...you had him murder your own grandson, your own granddaughter.
how could you do that? To protect Bruce?
you don't understand. How could you?
Bruce is my everything; my baby.
there is nothing I wouldn't do to protect him.
and Grace...Steven, Molly-- what about them?
Bruce tried everything to bring the family back together.
my son is not perfect.
but Grace, that little bitch. She tricked him.
and she was gonna tell everyone.
come on, they were your own flesh and blood.
they didn't grow inside of me.
I didn't give them life, feed them from my own breast.
judge me when you've lived that.
we don't have to live that to judge you.
we already know what you are.
what do you think?
good, thank you.
my wife made a whole bunch. For the flight.
I've never been to Virginia. To my cousin's.
Oh, well, Virginia's very nice. I think you'll like it.
I used to live there, for a while, when I was a kid.
Really?
I lived a lot of places, actually. Moved around a lot.
it can be scary, I know. New places, new people.
but you're gonna make a lot of friends.
you still got that number I gave you?
good.
cause if you're ever feeling scared or sad, you know that I'm your friend, right?
so we can talk.
I'd like that.
me, too.
Hey, Molly It's time to go.
okay, sweetheart.
let me help you with your jacket here.
you all set?
Yeah.
thank goodness.
you're gonna do great.
it's to you, Mr. Gentry. $65, 000 to call.
you've been playing me all night.
in fact, I think you're playing me right now.
what about you, Audrey?
you think this kid's trying to pull one over on me again?
I couldn't say.
well, what the hell. It's only money, right?
I'm all in.
I'll call.
let's do it.
Mr. Gentry shows a straight.
two pair. Aces and kings.
Oh, I knew it. I got you.
three-to-one odds in my favor. This one's finally gonna be mine.
$490, 000 in the pot.
Oh, no. No damn way.
the ace makes a full house.
tough luck, man. Maybe next time.
cash me out?
Congrats. What are we looking at, a little over $600, 000?
sorry, gentlemen. Back-ups will kick in any second.
in the meantime, everybody keep your hands away from the table, please.
this is Brantson. We lost power in the Rialto Room.
everybody get back! Out of the way!
this maniac hit the Four Kings, made off with over a million bucks.
well, I wouldn't exactly say he "made off."
no, you're right.
even if you leave with it, this town has a twisted way of getting it back from you, doesn't it?
security guard's pretty shaken up. He never shot anyone before.
well, he still hasn't. There's no wound, there's no blood. Nothing.
why'd he go down?
what the hell happened to him?
whoa, he's swollen.
here you go. We were able to collect just about all the scattered cash.
are you sure the upstanding citizens of Fremont didn't try to stuff their pockets?
with this? Why bother? It's counterfeit.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll say.
and bad counterfeit at that.
chips are fake, too. They're plastic.
so, this guy leaves the casino with over a million dollars.
where did it go?
I don't know. I'd ask him, but I don't think he's gonna be much help.
Oh, his name is Paul Brantson. He was only 25 years old.
married his high school sweetheart just six months ago.
this is your first one back.
you went through a lot.
I can handle this, if you need me to.
no. I'm fine.
you know, I gotta do it.
I'm Captain Jim Brass. Tell me what you told the other police officers.
I...It all happened so fast, I, uh... it wasn't even real.
okay, I want you to think real hard. Before the lights went out, did anything happen that might have tipped you off that something was up?
I don't know. I just... I can't remember!
I had a glass or two of wine. Just, I don't... just trying to calm my nerves.
I... Sorry.
thank you. Excuse me.
I talked to about ten witnesses.
not one of them can be sure of what they saw.
this whole thing looks like it was designed that way-- to confuse.
says 201 area code. That's New Jersey.
you still settling Nancy's estate?
mundane little things that are just never ending.
if you need to take that, go ahead. We can handle things.
everything okay?
help me focus. What do we know?
well, winner was cashing in on over 600 grand.
his chips on the table, cash to match, more stolen from the cart.
total take -- just over a million and a half.
a million and a half that's still missing.
Yeah, but the timing is what's bothering me.
the suspect knew exactly what time to hit-- the pay-out.
so he had eyes in the room.
anyone here stand out?
no, but there is a guy who's still missing. Robert Gentry.
he was the last player out of the game. Gone before the first cops arrived.
you think he's our guy in the room?
couple witnesses said that Gentry and our suspect collided during the robbery.
what that an accident, or was it a hand-off?
it would explain where the money went.
Yeah. Let's find Gentry.
you three want to be left alone?
very funny, Finn.
I could use a hand getting these leathers off.
sure. Ah, it's tight.
must have been a size or two smaller when he bought them.
I venture to say he was a size or two smaller when he put them on.
didn't start the day like this.
body's swollen; significant edema.
some sort of allergic reaction, maybe.
Clint Tyree. He worked at the Four Kings.
Yeah, he rode a motorcycle in their stunt show.
can't say I've ever seen it.
judging by these X-rays, must be a hell of a show.
he's broken almost every bone in his body.
guy could have used a new pair of boots.
so what do you think caused his allergic reaction?
well, I saw a raised mark on his shoulder.
could be as simple as a bee sting or spider bite.
a guy robs a casino, shoots a security guard, and rides off on a motorcycle, and gets killed by an insect?
I only said it could be.
it's the left shoulder, right?
look at that.
an injection mark. Somebody did this to him on purpose.
you need anything else before I zip him up?
no, no, go ahead. You can take him.
ma'am, please...
is that him? Is that Paul?
I'm so sorry, ma'am, but you can't be here.
that's my husband! I have to see him!
please?
are you sure you want to do this?
please?
okay.
ma'am.
all the while he was on active duty, four tours of Afghanistan, he wouldn't marry me.
you know why?
he was afraid of making me a widow.
he didn't want to put me through that if something happened to him over there.
I'm so sorry.
how does this happen?
how does he survive four years of hell over there, just to come back home and die where he's supposed to be safe?!
talk to me, Hodges.
in English.
the writing on these newspaper bits is Chinese.
that, combined with traces of carbon, potassium nitrate and sulfur, tells me the explosives used in the heist are essentially untraceable.
they're Chinese fireworks.
M-80s, most likely.
available at most any fireworks stand outside the city, if you flash a little cash.
which brings us to our next potential dead end, the strobe ball.
it's a visual effects device used in the motorcycle stunt show of the Four Kings Casino.
the suspect could've stolen that from his job...
what about the casino's security video?
to complete the dead-end trifecta?
okay, there he is.
that's him, right there. That's the guy we're looking for.
what's going on?
it's the strobe.
the camera's aperture couldn't keep up with it. It doesn't get any better.
so fix it.
what do you propose I do? - I don't know.
we got to find out if this guy Gentry was in on this heist.
you want me to do it? - No, no, n...I got it.
the lights in the Rialto Room work just the same as the lights in the rest of the casino.
they're all automated, controlled by a central system.
so how's the system controlled?
you have to be able to turn the lights on and off when you want to.
well, it's... like everything else these days, it's, uh... it's essentially... an app.
you have to have an access code.
but once you're in, you can program whole floors, you can control individual fixtures, whatever you need.
so whoever killed the lights should be in the system.
pretty much, he'd have to be.
that's a cute kid. How old is he?
he's ten months old.
so the real question is who has the app? Or the access codes?
besides me? Uh... security department, hotel manager, executive manager,
I mean, just a handful of people, probably.
well, we're gonna need a list.
I don't have that list.
I mean, I set up the system, but the hotel manager controls the access.
Morgan...Our missing poker player, Rob Gentry, just turned up.
he was at the Palermo Casino, playing with Four Kings chips.
you had quite a night last night, didn't you, Mr. Gentry?
first you go all in at the Rialto Room, lose, then you wind up in this armed robbery.
Yeah, I tell you, whole thing was pretty crazy.
I feel lucky just to be alive.
lucky? Oh, yeah. But you're also a little stupid.
come on, you didn't think we'd have every casino in town looking for these Four Kings chips?
and your dumb ass rolls into the Palermo today, buys in with 75 grand worth.
Where'd you get it?
well, you know, I can't remember if I... if I won 'em or bought 'em.
I've-I've had 'em for quite a while.
you see that? It's an RFID chip.
each one of these chips has its own digital identification number.
it helps the casino keep up with chip movement.
and these particular chips were scanned last night as they were being put on a cart for the Rialto Room.
so the only way that you could have them is if you stole them.
wait. I had nothing to do with that robbery.
Yes, you did, Robert. You and your motorcycle buddy?
we've got you on video texting him, giving him the signal to strike.
you're on the hook for murder, bud.
when that robbery went down, I-I ended up on the floor.
suddenly, I'm face-to-face with the chip cart.
so you just helped yourself to a handful, is that it?
I lost big at the tables last night.
it was just a way to recoup a little.
but I didn't kill anybody.
look, maybe I can help you.
yeah? How's that?
well, as... as I was slipping out of there, I... I ducked into a service hallway off the main casino.
and I saw him, saw the guy in the motorcycle gear running away.
you know that's in the opposite direction.
well, I-I'm just telling you what I saw.
Hey, we got to run this.
new security footage from the east side of the casino.
you don't know how happy that makes me.
of course... sets the stage for greater disappointment.
not batting a thousand today?
so far, no.
swing and a miss.
can I see that again?
it's just him running away. It doesn't help tie Gentry to the robbery.
will you please replay it?
I was just in autopsy. I saw Clint Tyree's X-rays.
he has multiple healed fractures and titanium posts.
there is no way that he could run like that.
this boot belongs to Clint Tyree, our stunt rider who died out on Fremont Street.
check out the wear pattern.
uneven on the outer heel, right?
guy probably had a limp.
from a lifetime of motorcycle injuries.
now, look at this. Right after the robbery.
no limp. Not even close.
now enlarge the boot.
no wear pattern.
it's a different boot. Two suspects, identically dressed.
one of them pulls off the robbery, makes a run for it down the hall...
to where the other one must've been waiting.
tyree knows he's playing the part of a decoy.
but he doesn't know he's also the patsy.
and right before he rides away, he gets an unexpected parting gift.
the deadly injection.
the guy who hit the Rialto Room is not the same guy who died out on the street.
Hey, Doc. Hear you got a C.O.D. for me on our motorcycle rider here.
well, the C. O.D. was easy -- the allergic reaction.
the interesting part is the cause.
I was able to identify the toxin that was injected into Mr. Tyree's shoulder.
an extremely aggressive coagulant.
this is an exemplar sample.
watch what happens when I add a single drop into a beaker of blood.
wow, look at that. Massive clotting.
in just minutes, all the blood's clotting ability is exhausted.
and as a result, massive internal bleeding occurs, in some cases leading to total exsanguination.
but, now, we didn't see that with Mr. Tyree here.
no, because his allergy to the toxin killed him first.
without the allergic reaction, he would've been in for a slow and very painful death.
what was the toxin? - Snake venom.
a species called Daboia russelii, commonly the Russell's viper.
no relation, I'm assuming?
none that I'm aware of.
you said, without the allergy, it would've been a slow death.
but Mr. Tyree there was a professional stunt rider.
he could've led the cops on a wild chase for who knows how long.
but the allergy caused him to drop in the first few minutes.
Yeah, exactly.
so maybe our real robber had to change his plans. Right?
maybe he had to do things a little faster.
thank you. Thanks.
well, you were right.
within an hour of that robbery, we had every casino in town looking for those chips, but we were too late -- he cashed 'em in immediately.
so by the time we sounded the alarm, chips were already in a casino vault.
try six different casino vaults, all sister hotels to the Four Kings.
the Mediterranean got a shot of our guy.
there he is right there.
with that disguise, it could be anybody. - Exactly.
Hey, so, I've been doing some checking on the Russell's viper.
turns out this thing is so dangerous it requires a permit for ownership.
please tell me you found one.
right here in Vegas. Guy's name is Julian Reese.
he's a valet car parker for the Four Kings Casino.
another employee.
didn't show up to work today. Brass already put a BOLO out.
all right, I'll follow up. See you later.
Hey, Stokes. So, parking enforcement spotted the car.
when the plates came back to Julian Reese, they called us.
when we found this, we called you.
Yeah, that's our snake charmer, all right.
looks like he got it right here. Single shot to the head.
there's a small caliber casing on the ground.
there's also some bruising on his face.
Yeah, looks like somebody beat him up pretty good.
and grabbed his shirt. There's a tear in it.
looks like there's some residue or trace. We'll get it back to the lab.
so that makes two casino employees, the stunt rider and the valet parker, both involved in the robbery.
and both dead, which means there's at least one player left in the game.
someone who I'm assuming didn't want to share the money.
so then what was this guy's part?
Oh, I'd say he played a starring role.
uh, I'll start with the good news.
this... is definitely your murder weapon.
venom from the Daboia russelii viper.
and I found DNA consistent with Clint Tyree in the hypodermic tip.
however, I've been less successful getting DNA from the leathers.
there was quite a bit of perspiration inside, so I had high hopes initially, but no luck yet.
I'm taking another crack at it, but for now, I can't confirm that they were worn by Julian Reese.
what's with the orange color? - Yeah, I'm not sure.
it might have something to do with the leather-tanning process.
thought you might be interested to know that I have identified the trace left in the snake charmer's shirt lapels.
your residue looks to be pumice. - Pumice?
Oh, uh, volcanic rock.
created when super-heated, highly pressurized igneous rock is propelled from a volcano.
is there any reason I couldn't have told her that?
guys, I know where pumice comes from. Why would it be on his shirt?
well, it has many common uses.
such as lightweight concrete, insulation, it's an additive in plaster and it's even found in toothpaste.
is that it?
no? If the pH is alkali, that could indicate the presence of...
soap.
mechanic's soap.
look, I can't be here. I just can't. Do you hear me?
I need you to sit in that chair now.
but you don't understand what you're doing. You don't know what's going on.
Ryan, we found pumice from your hand cleaner on Julian Reese's shirt.
do you want to tell us how that got there?
look, I can explain everything. Okay? Just not now.
I can't be here, all right? Please.
we got a warrant. We checked your phone, okay?
it was your access code that shut down the light in the Rialto Room for the robbery.
you were in on that heist.
and... you shot Julian Reese so that you could have all the money to yourself.
fine, okay, don't talk. We're in your home right now, turning it upside down, and we're gonna find the proof that we need.
well, no sign of the money.
and there's no evidence of a female living in the house, either.
I think he divorced the wife.
no divorce. She died. From cancer.
these are all condolence cards. These are all medical bills.
poor kid just loses his mother. Now he's gonna lose his father, too.
Morgan... you gotta check this out.
Sara... this whole thing just went sideways.
we know what happened. They kidnapped your son.
Yeah, now thanks to you, they're gonna kill him.
so, what we're gonna do is just keep you in here.
we figure the best thing for you to do is stay inside, in case they try to contact you.
now, all our boys are gonna be here. We're gonna have taps on the phone...
no, no, no, no, no-- this is exactly what I didn't want.
they said no police.
if whoever has Christopher is watching, who knows what they'll do to him!
Hey, listen, man, there's a lot of people here working really hard to help you find your boy, and we're gonna do that, but we can't do it unless you cooperate. Okay?
sit down, tell me how you got into all this mess.
come on, let's sit down.
about, uh, two months ago, Julian approached me in the employee cafeteria.
Julian... Reese, the valet dude?
he came to me and said that there was a couple other people who had come up with a plan, a way to get rich off the casino.
what other people? - He didn't name names.
and to be really honest, I didn't take him that seriously.
I mean, we see so much money that comes through here every day...
I mean, and everybody's fantasizing about how they can get some of it.
but I just told him no thanks, that I wasn't interested, not while I have Christopher to worry about.
what's with the alarm, man? - I-I... got to take a pill.
yeah? Let me see that.
Rifampin? What do you take these for?
Christopher's nanny, one of the kids got meningitis, so now we're all taking it as a precaution.
Yeah, okay.
so, what did Julian say when you told him you weren't interested in his plan?
he just said it was no big deal, that was cool... and that was the end of it.
until yesterday morning.
I went in... to take a shower while Christopher was sleeping.
I mean, it couldn't have been more than two or three minutes at the most.
and when I came back out, he was gone.
and he wrote that note on my laptop.
keep quiet, do what we ask, and you'll get your kid back.
and I went and I confronted him at work.
did you get physical with him? - Yeah, yeah, I admit it, I lost my temper.
I hit him, but I didn't kill him! All right?
he said he didn't know where Christopher was, and that I should just go along, and that I should just shut off the lights in the Rialto Room.
but I did everything they asked.
where is he?
Where's my son?
we're gonna get him back for you.
you know, when I was taken... when I was being held...
at least I knew you guys were looking for me.
this little baby... what is he thinking?
he's in a weird place with... without his father.
Yeah...kid cases are always tough.
thing is... whoever took him... they already got what they wanted.
they have no use for him now.
Morgan, do you really want to go there?
why not?
they've already shown they have no trouble killing. What's one more?
Yeah, but this is a baby.
and you just have to hope that it's... somehow different.
Yeah.
sorry.
what's wrong with me?
you're only human.
Thanks.
let's check outside.
father said he was only in the shower for a few minutes;
maybe the kidnapper was waiting there, watching... for the perfect time to strike.
we got to find this kid.
Oh, yeah. Someone was definitely here, in this spot.
you can see his shoe impressions.
perfect view of the hallway towards the bathroom door.
kidnapper could have seen Ryan heading to the bathroom to take a shower.
what's this?
Hey, get a shot of that.
some kind of coin.
it could have fallen out of someone's pocket, if they were crouched down here.
well, it's definitely not U. S. currency. I don't know-- how's your Arabic?
my Arabic's crap.
but my Pashto's not bad.
Pashto? Like Afghanistan?
Yeah.
well, our first victim, the security guard, his wife said that he did four tours in Afghanistan.
you're thinking our innocent victim wasn't so innocent after all.
so, Paul Brantson was far from an angel.
he left the military with a bad-conduct discharge.
apparently, he was trying to smuggle more than a coin out of Afghanistan.
I checked the security schedule at the casino.
he wasn't even supposed to be working last night.
he traded shifts to be in the room.
so it was no accident he was there.
I just processed the security guard's car.
fibers found in the backseat are a match to the baby's crib.
there's also traces of zinc oxide. Diaper paste.
why won't anybody tell me what's going on?
my husband's dead, I'm trying to plan a funeral, and your people storm into my house and start tearing it apart without even an explanation!
ms. Brantson... please... take a seat.
do you recognize this? It's an Afghani coin.
Yeah. It's Paul's.
he always carried it with him to remind him of all the guys who weren't as lucky as he was, the guys who didn't make it back.
the problem is, we found it outside of the house where a young baby was kidnapped.
well, then obviously it's not Paul's.
it just looks like the one he carried.
except his fingerprint was on it.
and when we searched his car, we found evidence that a baby had recently been in the backseat.
no, no, this is insane.
there's no way Paul was part of a kidnapping.
do you know where your husband was at 7: 30 yesterday morning?
you know what? I'm not doing this with you.
I just lost my husband, and I haven't even been able to bury him yet.
I am very sorry for your loss, but right now, we are focused on finding that baby.
so if you know something, or if there's anything you want to tell us...
no, no. I'm not talking to you anymore.
I'm not speaking to anyone, except maybe a lawyer.
okay, we've got at least four employees from the casino -
the stunt driver, valet parker, security guard... and the maintenance worker.
these three all presumably part of the robbery crew, all killed during or after the heist.
well, so much for honor among thieves.
let me ask you something.
why not kill the maintenance worker? Why is Ryan still alive?
cause he doesn't pose a threat.
he didn't even know who the main players were, except for the valet guy.
and he wasn't in for a share of the spoils.
well, we know we have at least one more player out there -
whoever shot Julian Reese and took the money.
good chance it's another Four Kings employee, but there are over 400 of them, so it's gonna take time to run them down.
which we don't have-- that baby's been out there for more than 36 hours.
Hey, guys, just got a call from Akers. Ryan Archer is gone.
officer Akers!
what the hell happened here?
captain, he was only out of my sight for a couple of min -
why was he out of your sight at all?
h-he said he needed to use the bathroom. I went to check on him...
damn it, Akers, you had one job to do, just one job.
you were to sit on this guy, and keep an eye on him. That's it, one job!
Jim, come on, man, chill out.
shut up, Stokes. Don't tell me what to do.
you, get out of here.
captain... they contacted him!
well, we've been monitoring his phone.
this is an e-mail.
this is your last chance. Meet at the employee parking lot, level four.
he's gonna get his kid.
no, he's gonna get himself killed.
I don't see him. I think we're too late.
I don't see him, either.
Ryan? What happened?
I've done it. I've lost him. I'll never see him now.
all right, calm down. Is this your blood? Are you hurt?
it's not my blood. It just went off. I didn't mean to.
what went off?
I was just sitting in the car, waiting. Next thing you know, somebody comes up to my blind spot.
suddenly, a gun was at my head.
and as I was trying to get out, I mean, I guess the gun went off.
Nick... I got a body.
it's the dealer from the card room.
no pulse. She's dead.
no, no. No. She was the one person who knew where Christopher was.
you'd better start talking to me, Ryan!
I got keys.
over this way.
you stay with me! Stay with me!
I got the baby.
Christopher! Oh, my God.
Oh, no, no, no. Stay back, Ryan.
there's no way I'm gonna let you touch him, and you're covered in blood.
it's my son.
look, the important thing is that he's okay, see? He's okay.
there's Daddy.
we'll get him to the hospital, we'll get you to the hospital, we'll get him checked out.
it's gonna be okay.
okay, buddy. Daddy's right here, okay?
just get his Bun-Bun, all right? It's gonna make him feel better.
Yeah, we'll do that; we'll get his Bun-Bun. Come on, let's go over here. Come on, now.
you're okay.
our dead poker dealer, Audrey -- just came from her house.
she's got all kinds of kids stuff. She's got toys, food, a makeshift crib.
looks like she was gonna keep that kid for the long haul.
also found this disposable phone.
in it was the text signaling Ryan to turn off the lights.
so, she was the eyes in the poker room.
okay... the gun we recovered next to the dealer's dead body belonged to her.
Greg just ran ballistics. It's the gun that killed Reese in his car.
so, what are we thinking, that she's the mastermind, the femme fatale, the one who seduced the other three into executing her plan?
Oh, way she looked, it wouldn't have been that hard.
is this it?
is this really the whole team?
no... No, we can't.
Where's the money?
Oh, that's not a late-night snack, I'm guessing.
no, I just came from the hospital. They belong to the baby that was kidnapped and his father.
we looking for anything specific?
well, let's start with where the baby was and who he might have had contact with.
Oh, try to preserve that the best you can. It's special to the kid.
Yeah, it's funny how babies do that, fixate on one particular toy.
when I was a baby, mine was an elephant called "Stinky.
guess I carried him around in my mouth a lot.
he was always moist.
moist means bacteria, which leads to stinky.
Henry, look at this.
it looks like sweat stains, the pattern, at least, but the color...
it's orange.
just like the tint that came off the motorcycle leathers.
it wasn't from the tanning process. It's from the perspiration.
Chromhidrosis-- colored sweat.
it's a rare condition on its own. More often, it's a side effect of something else.
like copper miners can sweat blue from the minerals in the mine.
what about this? What about orange?
could be a pharmaceutical side effect.
is this baby taking any medication?
Oh, finally.
doctor said everything looks good.
there's nothing to worry about.
thought I might never get to hold him again.
no one's happier than me to see this reunion.
I've been so obsessed with the loss of my wife, I haven't focused enough on him.
you did the best you could.
how's your son, Mr. Archer?
seems to be doing fine. Doctors said he checked out okay.
I guess the kidnappers took pretty good care of him then.
fed him, changed his diaper, gave him his medication.
your son is on rifampin, right? You both are?
what's going on, Sara?
well, the hospital ran blood tests on Christopher tonight, and his rifampin level suggested he had a dose about ten hours ago.
would you like to explain to me how the kidnappers knew to give him his medication?
well done, Mr. Archer.
you played us, you played the sympathy card with your son.
you had us all believing that you were one of the victims. Not bad.
look, I don't care what you say. I didn't kidnap my own son.
it was that security guard, just like you said.
they took Christopher to force me to be part of their plan.
that's what you wanted us to think.
but it was you who planted the Afghani coin in your garden, and it was you who put the diaper paste in his backseat.
my God, you make me out to be like I'm this criminal mastermind with this crazy plan.
I just did what I had to do!
I turned off the lights. That's all.
that is not all. Not even close.
this, uh, medication you're on, rifampin, has an interesting side effect.
it's called chromhidrosis. Causes colored sweat.
your baby's sweat is orange, your sweat is orange. Haven't you noticed?
we've only been taking it a couple days. Does it really matter?
Yeah. Yeah, it matters.
that's you.
you were sweating when you robbed the card room.
you were sweating when you shot Paul Brantson.
injecting Clint Tyree with snake venom--that made you sweat, too, right?
and then, after the robbery, you went and you killed Julian Reese, and then you stashed the motorcycle leathers and the syringe in his car, hoping that we'd think that Reese was the gunman.
there was only one problem. Those motorcycle leathers absorbed a lot of sweat-- orange sweat
when I compared them to the shirt that I took from you tonight, guess what?
they were a perfect match, right down to identical traces of rifampin.
so that puts you in the leathers, Ryan.
you're our guy.
you robbed the Rialto Room, and you killed four people.
I didn't do it for me.
Oh, let me guess. This is the part where you argue for father of the year.
Chris was five months old when my wife died.
do you have any idea the amount of medical bills she left behind?
so, you killed four people to pay them?
so much money goes through that place.
I mean, just a handful of chips would have changed everything for me and Chris.
I mean, just think how I could have raised him.
Yeah, how are you going to raise him now?
Hey, man. Hey, you got a second?
Yeah, sure. What's up?
I owe you an apology.
for what?
for jumping on you and jumping on Akers.
I talked to Akers, and now I'm talking to you-- I'm sorry.
Jim, I get it.
you got a lot going on right now, okay?
Yeah, I got a lot going on, yeah.
the D. A.'s calling me. The prosecutor wants to talk to me about testifying against my daughter.
Yeah, I mean, I'm on the phone six or seven times a day to New Jersey, handling my ex-wife's affairs.
come on, everything will be back to normal eventually. You know that.
back to normal-- I'd like that.
but I'll tell you, Nick, the way my life's going right now, I don't know what normal is.
just got off the phone with Greg.
they found the money in a maintenance locker at the casino.
good.
sit down.
I just wish we could take the money, you know, put it in a trust for that poor kid.
that'd be nice.
well, kids are resilient. Maybe he'll be all right.
what about you?
you gonna be all right?
time heals all, right?
I guess we'll find out if that's true.
have a good night.
you, too.
this week on "Elite Chef," we are down to the final four competitors.
only one of these chefs will take home half a million dollars.
will it be...Ray, the firefighter turned chef?
Curtis, Mr. Cordon Bleu?
or Cici, the private chef to the stars?
or Michelle, the talented hash-slinging single mom?
chefs, what would you say is the most indispensable tool in your kitchen?
that's easy, my knife.
something even more essential.
my palate.
very good, Michelle.
today's advantage round is a palate test.
each one of you gonna sample one of these four dishes and identify the mystery protein.
first chef to do so will win immunity for the next round.
chefs.
give it a try.
looks like some herb-crusted meat.
it's not beef or pork. It's too chewy.
strong iron flavor.
is this made from liver? Maybe lamb?
that's incorrect.
lots of Asian spices.
reminds me of a fish eye soup I had in Vietnam.
definitely not a fish eye.
could be...pig?
Oh, my God, is that a contact lens?
it's human!
it looks human. But, uh, I can't say for sure.
you know, they're down to the final four.
they must shoot this show, like, six weeks ahead, because I watched last night, and there were still ten contestants.
can you believe Michelle is still in the running?
after she served that undercooked chicken roulade to the judges last week?
didn't realize you guys were such big fans of the show.
good-looking people making great-looking food? We love this show.
well, you're gonna have to find some other show to watch until we figure out this mystery ingredient.
it's not caviar. Definitely human blood.
I got it right! I guessed "human"!
you all heard me say it. I win immunity.
Oh, come on. That's crap!
we were all thinking it. You just said it first.
nobody wins this round. The mystery protein was supposed to be - kangaroo.
it doesn't matter. I got it right. I win.
ray? Is that your name? Ray? - Yeah.
what made you think it was human?
last time I checked, animals don't wear contacts.
but didn't you think it was a little bit odd that a show would cook and serve up a human being?
that wouldn't be the weirdest thing to happen on a reality show.
this is an elite culinary competition, not "Fear Factor."
somebody must have sabotaged these dishes.
maybe they swapped the meat to give themselves an edge up.
what do you think, Ray?
they don't exactly sell human body parts at the grocery store.
no, no. There's only two ways you get a body: you steal it or you kill it.
you know, it's gonna be hard to I. D. our victim.
once flesh has cooked, the DNA becomes denatured.
there's no way an entire body was used to make these four dishes.
so what happened to the remains of the remains? That's what I'd like to know.
so, who's in charge here? - Right here, sir.
Oh, there you go.
uh, ma'am? Sorry. Could we, uh, talk to you for a second?
executive producer, Nadine Bradley.
uh, how long is this going to take? Because we were right in the middle of filming.
ms. Bradley, you-you called us when you found human body parts in your food.
we're gonna need to find out how that happened.
Yeah, well, we're the highest rated culinary competition show on air, so any of our rivals could've pulled a stunt like this to try and sabotage us.
or an eliminated contestant.
the prize money is just the beginning.
your past winners have gone on to open their own restaurants, become celebrity chefs.
a win is worth millions.
I doubt any of them are involved.
the eliminated contestants are sequestered at a nearby hotel -
we don't want viewers knowing who's been kicked off.
we're gonna also need to see your footage from the last 48 hours.
we have 13 cameras on this stage, seven in the house set where the remaining contestants live.
are they on all the time?
no. The cameras on the house set shut down about 10: 00.
that's still over 500 hours of footage.
so, this was a palate test.
the contestants did not cook the food. Who did?
we have a team of prep chefs who use the kitchen set after-hours. Clocked out about 9: 00 last night.
went and did an event at the Palermo, then came back at 6: 00 this morning.
we're still gonna need to talk to 'em though.
who had access to the kitchen last night?
the contestants and the entire crew.
that's legal. Sorry. I have to take this.
cast and crew? That is over 100 suspects.
Well...body was cooked in the kitchen.
can't believe I just said that.
start in the kitchen.
I just found human blood down that drain.
could be the body was dismembered here.
can you hand me that luminol, please?
I'll get the lights.
that's a large volume of blood.
lights, please.
means we're not looking at a stolen body. We're looking at murder.
well, the prep chefs left at 9: 00, so the murder must have happened after that.
you know, these gel mats can hold an impression for up to 12 hours.
very close to the blood pool.
maybe we can I. D. the last person who stepped on it.
might be our killer.
you've heard how Jesus turned water into wine.
now watch in amazement as I turn blood into caviar.
you're comparing yourself to Jesus?
first, I take the blood and add it to a mixture of...calcium glucocinate and calcium lactate.
next, I add xanthan, a polysaccharide secreted from the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris.
used as a thickening agent in food and a stabilizing agent in makeup.
I took chemistry, too.
blend until thoroughly dissolved.
I take my handy pipette, extract some of the blood mixture and drop it into the alginate one drop at a time.
I will pull the sphere from the alginate, plunge it into an ice-cold water bath and...
I'll pass, thanks.
as you can see, molecular gastronomy requires great skill and an aptitude for chemistry.
something not all chefs possess.
so we still don't have a suspect.
no. But I have a very good idea who the victim might be.
Graham Deveraux is missing. - Who's that?
one of the founding fathers of molecular gastronomy.
he has a Michelin-star restaurant on the Strip. He was the guest judge.
taped an episode of "Elite Chef" yesterday.
and then this morning, did not show up for work.
you think he's the one in the soup?
well, he did have a very big confrontation with the contestant who was just eliminated.
I wouldn't feed it to my dog. And I hate my dog.
this looks like a big mess on a plate. No sense of presentation.
the presentation was flawed, but I think that it was seasoned very well.
but you seem to fail to appreciate there are other spices than pepper.
I would call you "Chef," but that would demean the entire profession.
that guy's just mean.
I think he's being honest.
Derek, I'm sorry, but you are not the Elite Chef.
I believe you have some passion for food, and maybe someday you'll have your own restaurant.
where he will probably kill someone with salmonella poisoning.
your cooking is horrific, Mr. Barlow.
do restaurant patrons a favor everywhere and get out of the food industry.
you know what? You better watch your back, Deveraux. Watch your back.
okay. That was a threat.
Derek was such a nice guy on the show, but I guess even nice guys have their breaking point.
back a bit more.
keep it coming.
that's great. Perfect. Thanks.
lucky you managed to stop the garbage truck before it made it to the dump.
all the trash collected from "Elite Chef" this morning is still inside.
you talk to the driver?
Yeah, didn't notice anything suspicious.
with all that rotting food inside, hard to tell if there's a body.
this could take a while.
well, we only have to go through the green bags,'cause those are the ones that the studio uses.
maggots.
I don't even notice anymore.
got an arm.
definitely male.
Mr. Deveraux, I presume.
hard to say.
Henry wasn't able to extract a DNA profile from the blood found in the kitchen.
looks like some of the flesh has been excised.
probably used to make that herb-crusted meat.
let's see if we can find the rest of him.
those look like fried mac and cheese balls.
definitely not mac and cheese.
I think it's something else. Rocky Mountain Oysters.
aren't those fried bull testicles?
indeed, they are, and quite delicious. It's like a light chicken nugget.
but they're about three times bigger than this.
this is an orchidometer. It measures testicle size.
and these are consistent with that of an adult human.
guess the killer didn't want to waste anything.
gross.
Hey, did you ever hear about that Japanese chef?
he removed his own genitals, and then served them at a dinner party for $250 plate.
Lowballed.
look at that. Dark pigmentation on the chicharone.
maybe I can reconstitute it.
that's a tattoo.
where have I seen that before?
I would call you chef, but that would demean the entire profession.
that's the tattoo, but that's not Graham Deveraux.
no, that's Derek Barlow.
who was just eliminated from the show?
and now eliminated for good.
so, Derek Barlow is not our killer. He's our victim.
DNA just confirmed it.
okay, where's Deveraux?
still unaccounted for.
a lot of killers miss work the day after they commit murder.
anyway, we know that Deveraux had an altercation with Barlow yesterday.
maybe we have the right players, just in the wrong roles.
you ask me, they're both scumbags. Especially Derek.
I know, as a producer, I'm supposed to be impartial, but that guy was a piece of work.
he did not appear that way on the show.
he was a great chef, and I wanted the audience to root for him, so I cut out a lot of the stuff where he was being an ass.
I can show you the raw footage.
sure.
what the hell?!
why don't you pick up your mess, sweetheart?
you're such an ass!
that is exactly how I like seeing my ladies in the kitchen-- on their hands and knees.
that's just the tip of the iceberg. He tried to sabotage all the contestants.
now this seems personal.
I mean, who would have hated him enough to want to cook him?
to be honest, I wouldn't put it past any of them.
Derek tried to sabotage me. Well, screw him.
I always thought his cooking was overrated.
he's gone, and I'm in the final four.
with Derek out of the way, I really think I can win this thing.
Greg and I were able to recover most of Derek Barlow.
at least the parts that didn't make it to the dinner table.
you know, I read somewhere that the Yanomamo tribe in the Amazon consume pieces of their deceased loved ones as an act of mourning.
a way of keeping them alive within them.
well, I don't think that was the case with Mr. Barlow here.
Finlay said everyone hated him.
Yes, but at least the killer was kind enough to kill Mr. Barlow before they dismembered and cooked him.
look at the margins near the disarticulations.
skin is blanched. Orange in color.
blood wasn't circulating.
may I? - Go ahead.
looks like he's had a head injury.
found that examining underneath his hairline.
based on the bruising, at least 48 hours old. It's unrelated to his death.
so, what's C. O.D?
exsanguination due to multiple sharp force injuries.
based on the width and depth of the wounds,I'd say the killer used a single-edged knife with approximately a seven-inch blade.
do you think the killer used the same knife to dismember him?
no, I don't believe so.
look at the radius and ulna here-- not a mark on them.
the flesh was removed with great skill and with the proper knife.
a boning knife.
Yeah, something any professional chef would have.
now, the stabbing, however, was less precise.
I noted tool marks on the ribs.
well, if we can microsil the tool marks, we may be able to identify the knife and our killer.
I love his music, but what's he got to do with this?
no, that's Rod Stewart. This is Rod Steward, with a "D."
he's a designer of high-end men's shoes. Very expensive.
his size-ten loafer matches an impression on the gel mat that Finn found at the crime scene.
well, that's interesting,'cause when I was on the set, I noticed most of the crew wearing running shoes.
so did a lot of the contestants.
well, up-and-coming chefs don't make a lot of money. But celebrity chefs do.
Graham Deveraux, our missing judge.
not missing anymore.
you feeling better?
Oh, just dandy.
lot of people have been looking for you.
what can I say? I'm a popular guy.
you're also the lead suspect in a homicide investigation.
what are you talking about?
Derek Barlow, the contestant who attacked you-- he was murdered last night.
Barlow is dead.
he was stabbed to death in the "Elite Chef" kitchen.
no.
well, that counts me out.
judges aren't allowed in that kitchen. It's against the rules.
if it's against the rules, then how do you explain the fact that we found an impression of your size ten Rod Steward loafer in the kitchen of Elite Chef right next to where Derek Barlow was murdered?
because I was there, but not with Barlow.
that hot female contestant-- what was her name?
uh, Cici? Yeah. She was showing me her secret rub recipe.
what time? - I don't know.
around 6: 00, after we finished filming.
and after your little hookup, you arranged for Derek to meet you in the kitchen so you could teach him a little lesson.
payback for attacking you on the show.
Derek Barlow wasn't just murdered.
he was carved up, cooked, and his blood turned into caviar.
molecular gastronomy-- which also happens to be your area of expertise.
look, any idiot can try their hand at molecular gastronomy for the bargain price of $59. 99.
you just buy a kit online.
where were you after 9: 00 last night?
uh, I was in a limo downtown doing body shots of tequila off two lovely young ladies.
you can ask them if you don't believe me. Their names were Candy and Brown Sugar.
so, you have something for me?
I found kratom in Derek Barlow's stomach contents.
it's a leafy herb from Thailand. Makes the ingestor irritable and on edge.
so, Barlow was drugged.
might explain why he attacked Graham Deveraux last night.
in high doses, that herb can be fatal.
so, what if someone tried to poison him, but it didn't work, so the killer had to stab him instead?
plausible theory.
Oh, uh, where are you and Elisabetta registered?
I wanted to make sure that I got you something you need.
that's very kind of you. But, honestly, I have no idea.
elisabetta is in charge of all things nuptial. - Really?
all I got to do is get to the church on time.
that's funny. I always thought of you as a detail-oriented kind of guy.
and yet, you're not even interested in planning the most important day of your life?
well, work keeps me very busy.
can I give you some advice, coming from somebody who's been down the aisle a couple times?
you should, um...you should get involved.
you should have an opinion. You know, band, DJ. Roses, lilies.
I know it may not seem important, but if the groom does not really care about the wedding, it makes the bride feel like you don't really care about her.
It's...symbolic.
analyzed the tool marks on Barlow's rib cage.
turns out, he was stabbed by his own knife.
guess the, uh, chefs all have their own distinct set of knives. They're all kept in the kitchen.
where anyone in the cast or crew has access.
doesn't help us narrow down our list of suspects at all.
but this might.
Curtis LeBlanc, one of the contestants.
but according to that, he used to be Curtis Gant.
it looks like Mr. Cordon Bleu has a record.
back in 2001, he served four years for possession with intent to sell.
didn't the show do a background check?
well, according to the producer, just cursory ones. Mainly to validate culinary history.
but if Curtis lied to the show about his criminal past, that would be cause for elimination.
maybe Barlow found out about Curtis's secret, threatened to expose him.
now that would be motive for murder.
I perfected my craft in kitchens all over the world. It's my time now.
no one's gonna stand in my way.
well, congratulations, Mr. LeBlanc.
word on the street is you're the odds-on favorite to win "Elite Chef."
not bad for an ex-con who honed his culinary skills making vats of mystery meat stew in the federal pen.
of course, you were Curtis Gant back then.
look, I-I was, um...I was a new man when I got out.
a better man, so...so I changed my name.
but you didn't tell the show. You actually lied about your criminal past.
and if they had found out, you would have been kicked off.
you would have lost your shot at a half a million dollars.
only one person on the show knew your secret. That was your buddy, Derek Barlow.
as it turns out, you guys go way back.
you were frat brothers at Brassard University in Florida.
friends ever since. Even roommates here on the show.
but, I mean, let's face it.
half a million dollars-- that could turn even the best of friends into enemies.
what happened?
Barlow threatened to expose your secret? Is that why you killed him?
we know that you tried to poison him earlier in the day.
we found trace amounts of the herb kratom in his stomach contents.
you special-ordered it from Thailand two weeks ago, so give me a break.
but that didn't kill him, so you lured him into the kitchen and you stabbed him to death.
I didn't kill Derek. I wasn't even in the kitchen last night.
I didn't stab him and I wasn't trying to poison him.
I just...I gave him a little kratom to-to make him sick, to throw him off his game.
Derek was always better than me...at everything.
even on the show, he was winning every challenge.
I...just needed an edge.
so, after you edged out Derek, where did you go?
back to our room.
how long did you stay there?
all night. Drank till I passed out.
look, I-I wasn't trying to get Derek eliminated. I just wanted to win.
nice digs for a reality show.
so Derek Barlow was killed in the kitchen sometime between 10: 00 and 6: 00, which means Curtis LeBlanc could have left this room anytime during that window and the cameras wouldn't have picked him up.
Barlow was stabbed multiple times, dismembered.
must have been a lot of blood.
killer would have definitely gotten some on him.
let's see if LeBlanc took some to go.
Morgan, look at this.
a fingerprint in blood.
looks like it might have been used as a weapon.
didn't Barlow have a blunt force trauma to his head?
two days before he was killed.
maybe that's when Barlow threatened to go to the executive producers and tell them about Curtis's prison time.
they got into a fight.
then it got physical.
what are you gonna do, huh?
after the fight, Barlow promises to keep his mouth shut, but Curtis can't take the chance, so two nights later...
leblanc may have cleaned up the kitchen, but he left a mess here.
could send him right back to prison.
the alarm clock that we found under Curtis LeBlanc's bed?
blood on it belonged to the victim Derek Barlow.
was the fingerprint LeBlanc's?
no, but it did match another one of the contestants.
huh, Michelle Rowlands.
she's kind of the underdog on the show. She's tough.
tough enough to commit murder?
I miss my daughter so much. Losing is not an option.
Michelle, I'm impressed.
you made it to the final four of an elite culinary competition.
you're a diner chef from Ohio.
and a woman.
I mean, I worked twice as hard as the guys to get where I am.
Yeah, I hear the culinary world can be a bit of a boys club.
that's an understatement.
and Derek Barlow is their poster boy.
we know that he sabotaged you more than once.
you must have been very happy when Derek was kicked off the show.
he got what he deserved.
in more ways than one.
we found this alarm clock in Curtis and Derek's room.
that there is your fingerprint in Derek's blood.
what happened, Michelle? Had you had enough of his abuse?
decide to get back at him for how he treated you?
you obviously got into an altercation with him in his room, and two days later he's dead.
I didn't kill him.
you had motive, opportunity, and you certainly had the skill set to cut him up and cook him.
it's premeditated murder.
a cou...a couple nights ago, Derek invited me to his room. Curtis wasn't there.
he said he wanted to form an alliance. He gave me a drink.
tasted like licorice.
there must have been something in it, because next thing I knew, I woke up and...
Derek was on top of me.
his hand around my throat.
no, stop, please, stop!
shut up.
I couldn't get him off of me, so I grabbed the alarm clock and...
then I got out of there.
well, how come you didn't contact the police, Ms. Rowlands?
it was just the two of us in there.
it would have been my word against his.
Besides...a female chef accusing a male chef of rape?
I would have never worked again.
you know, I gave up everything to be here.
you know, quit my job, used up my savings.
weeks away from my daughter.
all of it would have been for nothing.
you know, I'm not sorry Derek is dead.
but I didn't kill him.
so, this was shot two days before Derek Barlow was murdered.
according to Michelle Rowlands, the rape happened just before 10: 00 p. m.
if she's telling the truth.
well, there she is.
she looks pretty upset. I'd believe her.
but this does not clear her of Barlow's murder.
if anything, it gives her a stronger motive.
well, she already hated the guy. This might have pushed her over the edge.
let's look for evidence, see if we're right.
whoa, hang on a sec.
that's Barlow's roommate Curtis LeBlanc, just minutes after Michelle left the room.
but she said he wasn't in the room that night.
Michelle was drugged.
Curtis could have raped her while she was unconscious, then been in the bathroom while Derek had his turn.
these guys are worse than we thought.
so, this one is called Tropical Desire.
yellow butter cake with Meyer lemon curd and key lime mouse-- mousse.
it's tart.
I thought it was light and refreshing, not so sweet.
well, I mean, if-if you like it, then we should go with that one.
we both need to like it.
the wedding cake is like
in Italy, when the bride and the groom feed each other cake, it tells the world that they will take care each other forever.
can't we tell the world with a flan?
cause I'm-I'm not a big cake guy.
wow, those look amazing.
you want to help us sample some? We're trying to make a decision.
Oh, no, no, that's something that only you two can choose.
so, Elisabetta, is your family coming over for the wedding?
of course. My parents, brothers, few of my cousins,
she has a big family.
Oh, must be hard to be so far away from them.
I miss them so much, but no, living here-- it's not forever,
temporary? Uh, uh, what do you mean?
of course we will have babies and we move back to Italy.
honey, I-I thought you liked it here.
Las Vegas is an amazing city, but it's no place to raise a family.
Yeah, but listen. I-I've built a career here.
it's just a job, David.
my father said you can work at the vineyard with my brothers.
I'm a highly trained scientist.
I have helped put serial killers behind bars, and y-you want me to go stomp grapes for a living?
is not about work.
I'm sorry, we shouldn't argue in front of you.
it's okay, a couple needs to iron out these details before they go down the aisle.
I wish I had done that with my first husband.
when we first got together, it was very romantic-- very much like you two.
where did you guys meet?
we met at a forensics seminar.
ended up ditching, spent the whole week together, and then, a month later, we got engaged.
and then, uh, we got married and real life set in, and...
as much as we loved each other, we were still very, very different people with different goals and different needs and...
just wasn't meant to be.
I'm thinking, uh, white chocolate raspberry symphony.
anybody else?
I'm sorry to have to tell you that, in light of the ongoing investigation, legal has decided to shut us down for the remainder of the season.
I'm sorry, you have been an exceptional crew, and you will all be paid for the next two weeks.
in the meantime, uh, let's strike the sets and get rid of all the perishables.
I'm so sorry.
excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me.
what's going on?
blunt force trauma to the head.
makes Curtis LeBlanc the second chef murdered this week.
killer competition.
smells like soda.
there's some trace in this wound. Looks like paper.
maybe from that label.
blood, bits of flesh. Yeah, this could be our murder weapon.
you know, Russell and I found evidence that LeBlanc was in the room when Michelle Rowlands was raped.
Yeah, but she never implicated him, just Derek Barlow.
maybe because she wanted to take care of him herself.
two men involved with the rape. Now they're both dead.
serving up her own justice.
so, I checked VICAP.
you know, Michelle Rowlands' rape was very well planned.
on a hunch, I entered some two men, date rape drug and a trace of licorice.
and I got nothing.
pretty unusual combination.
but then I thought there has to be other things that taste like licorice, right?
like-like fennel. - Ouzo.
and anise. And then...I got this hit.
unsolved case from over 15 years ago.
college freshman named Sally Lennon was raped and murdered at a Brassard University music festival.
traces of GHB and anise extract.
Barlow and LeBlanc went to the very same college.
and when LeBlanc was arrested for drug-dealing, they found his GHB in anise extract bottles.
says here two unidentified semen donors entered into CODIS.
did you run that against Barlow and LeBlanc? - I did.
And? - They matched.
so these two guys have raped before.
C. O.D. was asphyxiation due to manual strangulation.
and Sally's body was found scavenged by animals.
based on this old case, Michelle Rowlands is very lucky to be alive.
Hey, Doc. Got a C. O.D. on Mr. LeBlanc?
not blunt force trauma.
take a look at the esophagus here.
you see this swelling? It's laryngeal edema.
there's also evidence of eosinophilia in the lungs.
anaphylaxis.
according to his medical records, he had a severe almond allergy.
even trace amounts would've caused his throat to swell shut, resulting in asphyxiation.
but we know that he was hit in the head with a frozen leg of lamb.
maybe, maybe not.
it's possible that when Mr. LeBlanc started losing consciousness from the anaphylaxis, he fell, hitting his head on the leg of lamb.
he had to have known that he was deathly allergic to almonds.
how did they get in his system?
I didn't notice any needle marks or almonds in the stomach contents. Only soda.
morgan collected a drinking cup from the crime scene.
so, uh, I found trace amounts of amygdalin and benzaldehyde in the soda.
almond extract.
every single person on that show knew about LeBlanc's allergy, including Michelle Rowlands.
Greg's analyzing the cup now. Maybe he can find out who tampered with it.
let's hope.
Hey, um...do you have a second?
of course.
do you...think that I'm making a huge mistake by marrying Elisabetta?
I can't tell you what to do.
but I can tell you that, whatever you decide, I'm gonna be here for you.
I should get back to work.
so, um...I went to this wedding last year.
they wrote their own vows, which was kind of funny.
but the groom...he said something that just... man, it stuck with me.
"never marry the one that you think you can live with."
"marry the one you know you can't live without."
I figured out the source of the almond extract that killed Curtis LeBlanc.
it wasn't his drink. It was his straw.
hidden inside was a sugar straw laced with almond extract, made precisely to fit inside Curtis LeBlanc's straw.
he would have never noticed it.
so when he took a sip of the soda, it passed through the sugar straw, picking up trace amounts of almond extract, which then entered into his system.
his throat swelled up. Good night, Curtis.
but here's the thing: when rolling sugar, no matter how careful you are, it's hard not to leave an impression.
tell me you got a print.
better than that, I got a match.
ms. Bradley, as a producer, I assumed you worked your way up the ranks in television, but...
as it turns out, you're a classically trained chef.
I took courses at the Culinary Institute of America.
Ah, so you learned, uh, all about cooking, you know, from butchering to baking.
Yeah, I've always been fascinated with how chefs can make almost anything out of sugar, from a sculpture of a fire-breathing dragon to something as simple as a straw laced with almond extract.
this is the straw that killed Curtis LeBlanc. And that's your print.
we know you murdered LeBlanc. We're pretty sure you murdered Derek Barlow, too.
what we didn't know was why until we started digging into your background and found out that your maiden name was Lennon.
same last name as a young girl who was raped and murdered 15 years ago -
Sally Lennon, your little sister.
and the case was never solved.
when they found her, she was wearing my favorite sweater.
she was always taking my stuff.
it's the only thing we ever fought about.
the case went cold. My parents shut down.
they...they couldn't even mention her name.
must have helped that your college buddies, Derek and Curtis, were there for you.
you've been friends with them ever since.
when you found out what they did to your sister, you arranged to get them on the show.
you wanted them on your turf so that you could kill them.
no. I only found out three days ago.
I was going through raw footage, and saw Michelle coming out of Derek and Curtis's room, half naked, crying.
she told me about the rape.
she'd been drugged, tasted anise.
Derek's hand was around her throat.
sounded just like what happened to Sally.
so then you confronted Derek.
you and Curtis raped my sister, strangled her, then dumped her in the woods like a piece of trash.
you pretended to be my friend.
you...you knew how hard it was for me all these years.
and the whole time, it was you!
I get why you wanted Derek Barlow dead, but you didn't just kill him.
you carved him up, you cooked him.
you served him to people.
my sister was ripped apart and eaten by animals.
my parents couldn't bring themselves to identify the body, so I had to do it.
I have had that image in my head every day for 15 years.
Derek deserved everything he got.
and you wanted to do the same thing to Curtis, but there were cops everywhere, so you had to make his death look like an accident.
I made them pay for what they did.
and I finally got justice for my sister.
funny thing about Italian ice.
some scholars believe that it wasn't invented in Italy.
that it was actually created in China.
uh, sorry. You go first.
no, no, you go first.
I've been wanting to talk to you about something.
and I don't...know how to say this, but, um, lately, I...
I've been feeling that...
David, it's okay. I know.
I've been feeling the same.
you and I-- we're very different people.
we both like different things.
you're not happy here.
you'll not be happy in Italy, either.
you'll miss your friends, you'll miss your work.
and if we were truly meant to be together...
that wouldn't matter.
unfortunately, it does.
I need to go now.
I will always love you.
Ti amo.
Ciao, David. I'm sorry.

that's a hell of a run there, uh, Mr...
that's about $350, 000. Your lucky day.
I have a proposition for you. Why don't you stick around?
we're gonna put you upstairs in a suite on us.
you can eat up, clean up, and then come back down here in a few hours and take us for everything we got.
how does that sound?
no, I'd like to cash out... now.
excuse me.
who are you?
do you know what time it is? - I'm sorry?
it's 8: 00 a. m.as in the graveyard shift ended two hours ago.
you realize that, right? This body is, is mine.
I'm not going to get into a turf war with you right now.
because you'll lose.
look, don't make me call your supervisor.
Oh, too late. And you are...
Sean Yeager, day shift.
Yeah, your supervisor speaks very highly of you.
you're a CSI-2, right?
Yeah, one solve away from a promotion? - Yes, sir.
you know, I never cared much for this day shift versus night shift crap.
I mean, we're all one crime lab, right? All for one, one for all.
okay, look, cards on the table here.
I really do need this solve to be a solo.
I hate to break it to you, Yeager, but I don't think this is the game-changer that you're looking for.
homeless guy assaulted in an alley. Looks like a trash run.
yeah?
I'm not so sure about that.
Yeah, I think I'm with you.
why, do you got something?
uh, my wife Barbara is stranded at the airport, needs a lift.
so you should go pick her up. We'll take care of this.
the two of you work together?
I think that's a great idea.
don't you think?
like you said, all for one and one for all.
whew, this guy is ripe, and I don't think it's decomp.
I think he just may have really needed a shower.
he's got dirty clothes, got weathered skin.
he's been living on the streets for quite a while, you can tell.
you get a wallet, David?
no wallet-- I checked.
Yeager, come on, man, you know the protocol.
you can't touch my body without my authorization.
I didn't touch your body.
I saw a wear pattern on the back pocket with no lump. No lump, no wallet.
I figure the guy gets mugged, the attacker rifles through the wallet and tosses it in the nearest trash receptacle.
Hey, I'm not in here for my health.
you've been in there for a while. You found a wallet yet?
I'm working on it.
Hey, uh, liver temp was 91. 1,which puts time of death at around 3: 00 this morning.
I count 12 sharp-force injuries with a two-inch blade.
stabbed in the back.
I know how he feels.
you know what? When we close this case, you can have the solve.
Thanks, but I don't need your charity.
case... in point.
blood says it's related.
empty.
what is homeless guy doing with the Mission: Impossible briefcase?
so much for your trash run.
got blood drops.
looks like the assault started right here.
our victim is heading down the alley, he gets attacked from behind.
the assailant grabs the briefcase, steals what's inside.
but these blood smears and drag marks say that it didn't end there.
the killer sees his victim still alive, trying to crawl away, so he drags him out of sight, finishes him off.
you know, you see that blood on his finger and under his hand?
weird, right?
what do you suppose that means?
well, maybe it's a, a message, you know, last words to a loved one.
or, if it were me, my dying breath, I'd try to identify my killer.
I see you're not the sentimental type. Okay, I like that.
Oh, boy, honey, I'm so sorry. Problem solved.
Conrad wanted me to reschedule a hearing.
it's okay, I get it, I know you're a very busy person.
that's why I said I would take a taxi from the airport.
no, no, I told you I wanted to take you home. I'm gonna, I'm gonna take you home.
sit first.
have something to eat. These pastries are good.
pastry? No, I-- ah, I'm sorry, I can't-- couldn't possibly...
I will-- let me have a hit of that coffee, though. Thanks.
I'm sorry, really, I...
how are you? How was Seattle?
Maya and Katie are both doing very well, and Ryan talked with his company and worked it out so he can stay home more.
that's good.
have you talked to Charlie?
it's been crazy around here. I know I got a couple of messages from him.
is there something I should know?
well, there's something
Oh, come on, come on, that's not fair. I promise I'll act surprised.
what? What?
he's gotten an offer from Eastern Indiana-- full scholarship, starting point guard.
is he gonna take it?
well, I think so.
well, that is news.
it's great, it's just that, you know...
one of the reasons why we took this job was so we could be, you know, near Charlie, watch him play his games.
I think getting away could be good for him.
I know. I know.
I just didn't expect it, that's all.
things change, plans change.
that sounds like another discussion we need to have.
Yeah, but at another time.
I can tell you're busy, sweetheart, and I can take a taxi.
Hey, Doc, got your message. You have something for me?
Yeah, still working on our alley John Doe, but I found this in one of the wound tracts.
maybe a piece of the murder weapon.
tip of the blade-- maybe it broke off. I'll get it to Hodges.
tell me something-- these wound patterns...I admit sometimes cases start to blur together, but I could swear I have seen this somewhere before.
well, the two wounds in the center, closest to the spine, appear deeper and wider.
almost like the killer twisted the blade.
Yeah, but the rest of the wounds are clean, sharp.
that could be overkill, rage.
or something else-- a signature.
I'll pull some case files, see what I can find.
Thanks.
well, don't you look like a lovely couple.
let me guess. You're in the market for a ring?
information, actually. I am CSI Brody, and this is CSI Yeager.
I take it you're Ruby.
Yes, but...if this is police business, I must confess, I'm just the name on the door.
my boys run the store now.
I just come in occasionally to help out.
keeps me out of trouble.
little help up front.
coming, Ma. What's up?
well, these very nice, uh, police folks would like to talk to you about something.
I'll be in the back if you need me.
Oh, and, honey, don't let him get away.
we recovered this pawn ticket.
looks like it's from one of your customers last night.
we just need a name.
Hey, what's this about?
well, that wasn't the question.
this is time-stamped 11: 49.
why don't you look that up?
uh, our computers are down right now, so...
uh, 11: 49?
plaid shirt, T-shirt, jeans, smelled bad. Farami watch.
14 karat pinky ring with the inscription worn off at 90 days at 23%.
$200, uh, cash on the barrel.
you remembered all that?
can you remember his name?
Jeremy Sikes. 1139 Cornell Road, St. George, Utah, 84780.
I made a copy of his driver's license, too.
200 bucks for a Farami watch and a gold ring?
I can see you're, uh, real generous.
it's a secured loan. Guy doesn't come back for it, that's on him.
you sure it's just on him?
here you go.
thank you.
you mind if I hold onto this?
uh, yeah, sure. I always make a duplicate. You never know.
Oh, and the watch and the ring. You guys still have those, right?
Yeah. We got 'em.
great. We'll take those to go.
wow, somebody had a good night.
Yep, that's Jeremy Sikes from last night from the eye-in-the-sky from Pike's Gambling Hall.
this was distributed to security at all the casinos in town with a warning to keep a lookout for this guy.
Why? Was he causing trouble?
Oh, the worst kind. At least in Vegas.
our friend here took his $200 from Ruby's Pawn Shop, walked into Pike's and 37 hands, 45 minutes later, he had $350, 000.
well, at least we know why he had that briefcase.
$200 turning into 350 grand-- come on, what are the odds of that?
I'd say somewhere in the range of being eaten by a shark while being struck by lightning.
the casino, obviously, thought that he was cheating.
card counting?
no, the betting pattern was off.
they suspected collusion with his dealer, Kristi Holt, who, by the way, did not show up for work this morning.
you're thinking that Sikes and Holt were scamming the casino.
and then Holt stabbed Sikes in the back-- literally-- and ran off with the money.
interesting theory, but...
look at that-- Sikes drew quite the crowd.
any one of them could've followed him back into the alley, right?
my money's still on the dealer.
that's because you're assuming that they were cheating.
of course they cheated.
no, and Sikes even tried to I. D. his killer in his own blood: "D-E" spells "Dealer" to me.
look, for all we know, this is just one of those great Vegas stories:
guy pawns his last possessions, nets it all and wins.
the two of them are total strangers and it's just a case of dumb luck.
I don't believe in luck.
me, neither.
Why? What do you got?
a connection...between Jeremy Sikes and our dealer Kristi Holt.
the watch that Sikes pawned for stake money turned out to belong to Kristi's husband.
and here's the kicker: Her husband was murdered two months ago.
dumb luck, huh?
I'm thinking that maybe this casino heist isn't the first time that Kristi enlisted Sikes to engage in a little dirty work.
two months ago, she has him murder her husband.
and, last night, after they both scammed the casino, Kristi kills Sikes.
so it looks like we have this Kristi Holt dealing the death card-- not just once, but twice.
yaeger and I pulled the cold case file on the murder of Simon Holt, our blackjack dealer's husband.
you and Yaeger. Nice to see you kids getting along.
Yeah, well, let's just be clear: I'm Rizzoli and she's Isles.
anyway, the case is still open.
and maybe open because day shift was investigating.
don't look at me, okay? I was on the swing shift then.
the night of the murder, Kristi Holt was questioned.
she said she finished up her shift at Pike's then left the casino to meet up with her husband Simon.
they met for dinner, then got home around midnight. She was really tired.
immediately went upstairs to bed and he went to the living room to watch the news.
and that's when she heard two shots ring out.
she ran downstairs and found her husband dead and the place was ransacked.
so Kristi Holt's story is that her husband walked in on some guy robbing the place.
now, in defense of day shift, it was a good story.
there was no reason to doubt it.
until last night...when Jeremy Sikes turned up dead.
after pawning Kristi Holt's husband's watch, and going on one hell of a run at her blackjack table.
they say there are no coincidences.
Yeah, but...sometimes there are.
Yeah. Right. Dumb luck.
I thought we agreed that luck wasn't a player in this.
all right, well, then, call it destiny. Or fate.
of all of the blackjack tables in all of the world-- is that where you're going with this?
no, where I'm going with this is there's one person still alive who can answer these questions.
what, is that your wife again?
no, someone else's. A widow, as a matter of fact.
brass just picked up Kristi Holt.
if this is about what happened last night,
I'll tell you what I told Bobby, my pit boss:
it was a straight-up run. There was no cheat.
if we're just talking about cheating here, then this is your lucky night.
now it's my turn to deal.
your pal Jeremy Sikes.
Oh, my God, wha...that's...the guy. I... Is he...?
dead? Yeah.
but I think you know that.
how about I hit you again? Your husband Simon.
this is the time in this gambling session, when you go bust.
or you play your ace in the hole and tell me the truth.
the truth?
the truth is my husband was murdered when he walked in on a burglary.
you sure you want to stick with that story?
it's not a story. - Yes, it is.
and you really ought to hang out with a better class of co-conspirator-- or at least a smarter one -
because your pal Jeremy pawned your husband's watch for $200 and brought the money to the table -
that's what staked him in the game.
this guy...had Simon's watch?
Yes.
if he had his watch, it must be because he stole it because he's the one who broke in our house.
or there could be another explanation:
you could've given it to him as a little thank-you gift for killing your husband.
that's sick! I gave that watch to Simon for our anniversary!
Yeah. We checked with Farami.
it's a special order. Around $2, 000.
so I, I looked at the insurance records, the claims and the police statements, and...
nowhere is there mention of a $2, 000 watch.
my husband was murdered, Detective. I forgot about the damn watch!
you didn't forget about the insurance money.
which went to pay off Simon's debts!
which is why you and Jeremy doubled down at Pike's Gambling Hall, to the tune of $350, 000.
Kristi, you know, you didn't show up for work.
you end up at a motel, hiding under the bed...this doesn't look good.
if you worked for old-school guys at an old-school casino like Pike's, and they thought you cheated them... you'd be laying low in a motel, too.
and if this is the guy who broke in my house and killed my husband, then he deserved to die.
I didn't kill him, and I didn't have anything to do with cheating the casino last night, and if you don't believe me, check the damn tape, the cards, the shuffler-- I didn't cheat!
what do you got?
it looks like our dealer didn't cheat.
says you. I'm still not convinced.
this guy went on an insane run. We saw the tape.
he's hitting when he shouldn't, holding when he shouldn't-- the odds of that happening are...
183, 120 to one. I have an app.
okay. What about the evidence?
I did examine all 416 cards in play-- they weren't marked. And the shoe checked out.
and I looked at the shuffler. There's no sign that either one of them was tampered with.
and you didn't get anything on the eye in the sky?
no. If she was palming cards or pulling some sleight of hand, she was doing it between the video frames.
okay, so she's a magician. That doesn't mean she's not a killer.
I like what she said.
looks like you're the only one.
so we weren't the first to toss Kristi Holt into the box.
she was detained by casino security right after she left the blackjack table, and then was interrogated by her pit boss Bobby Esposito.
that's them in the holding room. Check out the time code.
2: 58 a. m.
Sikes' time of death was 3: 00.
so Holt's inquisition lasted over four hours. There is no way that she killed Sikes.
so who did?
well, I hate to admit it, but Russell may be right.
Sikes' run at the table did draw a crowd.
meaning there are several people who could've followed him out that night.
did you get a chance to look through the rest of the casino's floor footage?
did you see anybody that looked like they were shadowing him at all?
well, I didn't see anybody who was obviously following him.
wait a minute. Freeze it for a second?
what do you see?
take it back just a little bit. Right there.
that guy, talking to the pit boss. I've seen him before.
you've seen him before? Where?
on someone else's security video.
Where's your friend?
busy. Just get me this time.
you know, cops keep showing up around here, people are gonna get the wrong idea about my establishment.
you gonna return that watch and ring you took or...
no, they're still in evidence. Actually, I am here to look at a few other items.
you gotta be kidding me. - Nope.
the surveillance video that you gave us shows this guy coming into your establishment sometime after 3: 00 a. m.
he works for Pike's Gambling Hall. His name's Alonzo Pierce.
Pierce: uh, 1453-- 1456 uh, Silver Ridge Road, Seven Hills, 89052.
I got his phone number, if you need it.
Thanks. Actually, what I need is to look at the items that he pawned.
looked like an old turntable and some speakers.
right, and I would love to help you out with that, it's just...
it's such a mess back there right now, it's kind of...
I know where it is.
of course you do, little bro.
Yeah, Rain Man here will take care of you.
okay, uh, turntable, not valuable.
the speakers, they're Cadillacs. Frequency response 30 kilohertz, impedance four ohms...
you tried them out, and they didn't work, right?
Yeah, the left one's out. How'd you know that?
do you mind, uh, letting me borrow that little drill over there?
sure.
Thanks.
uh, I'm pretty good with electronics.
I'm sure you are.
these speakers, it's usually just a, like, a wiring issue.
well, in this case, I think it might be something just a little bit different.
uh, okay, that's a lot of money.
I'm guessing about $350, 000.
I don't understand that. If I had that kind of money, I'd put it in, like, a bank.
unless you couldn't.
place like this, people drop off an item, you keep it for 60 days, then they come back to collect.
beats a bank if you're trying to beat a murder charge.
pike's casino said Alonzo Pierce didn't show up for his shift today.
getting to be a habit with their workforce.
Yeah, a real brain drain at Pike's.
we buzzed Alonzo's apartment, no answer.
his manager said he was going on a trip; he took a small bag.
when was this? - A few minutes ago.
we got the exits covered; he's not going anywhere.
that's him.
Alonzo Pierce! Las Vegas Police. You're under arrest.
sorry, pal, but you're gonna be disappointed.
it's the pit boss.
told you.
what the hell are you doing here?
use your freaking imagination.
get him out of here.
pop the trunk.
Alonzo Pierce. That was a short trip.
Yeah, well, nobody steals from Pike's Gambling Hall.
well, at least somebody at Pike's is dedicated to their job.
tell you something, Bobby, you make detective work look simple.
I mean, there you are, standing there, gun in your hand, Alonzo's Pierce's body in the trunk.
I mean, all I had to do was call a tow truck.
I'm gonna make it even easier for you.
I'm gonna tell you exactly what that little bitch, Alonzo, did.
tell me.
you know I seen a lot of cheats in my time.
but last night, that was different.
I don't know exactly what this guy and my dealer had going on, but I knew the grift was on.
it had to be, cause nobody's that lucky.
see, in the old days, Vegas, when guys like Sam Braun used to run the town, we would've put this guy in a car, done a little carpentry on him.
he would've given it up.
town's changed. Not for the better.
right, more civilized now.
you whack guys in the alley.
I didn't tell him to whack the guy.
I just told him to get the cash back and put a little healthy fear of God in him before he put him on the Trailways bus.
so Alonzo killed Sikes on his own initiative?
and he stole the cash. Believe that?
I don't know what to believe anymore, Bobby.
I mentored him, and he turns around, this little bitch, and he doesn't have the cojones to look me in the eye and tell me the truth?
he has to make up some BS story about he didn't kill him.
he just roughed him up, and he put the cash away for safekeeping.
I'm not gonna lie to you, I-I would've whacked him anyway, Alonzo, but that's because he stole from the house.
that's a matter of honor.
old Vegas.
damn straight.
see, you and me, we're on opposite sides of the table, but I know that right here, we're on the same page.
I'm gonna ask you a favor.
what's that?
put in a good word for me at sentencing.
I'd like to get sent up to Carson City...with the old boys.
men of honor.
done.
heard you caught a case with day shift.
Yeah, lucky me. Seems to be case closed.
right. Homicide, guy's luck ran out in the alley.
Yeah, the casino pit boss sent one of his goons after the guy.
the goon kills him, takes the money, and then he stashes it in a stereo speaker and then pawns it.
now, why am I doing this?
this day shift guy, Yeager, really wants this solve, he should be the one finishing up the paperwork.
your victim was stabbed multiple times, wasn't he?
Yeah, why?
I don't know, I'm just looking at the timestamps on these photos.
so, the security goon gets his orders from the pit boss at 2: 48 a. m?
Yeah, and then the goon follows him to the alley and kills him around 3: 00.
what are you seeing?
you know, what about the clothes?
doesn't this look like the same suit, same shirt, same tie?
Oh, my God, you're right.
guy stabs him 12 times, and he doesn't have a single drop of blood on his clothes.
yeager still hasn't gotten his solve.
Hey, Morgan, I've been looking for you.
so your security guard didn't kill Sikes.
Yeah, I know.
what, Hodges told you about the bullet?
what bullet?
the metal fragment we found in Sikes' wound track.
we thought it was the tip of the knife, but it turns out it's from a bullet.
I thought he was stabbed. Now you're saying he was shot?
Yeah, twice.
and then the killer used the knife to dig out the bullets, and then proceeded to stab him ten more times.
to throw us off track.
well, that's where he made his mistake.
doc thought he recognized the wound pattern, so I did some checking, found an open case from two years ago, same pattern.
drug informant was murdered. Person of interest was a Luis Delgado.
had ties to the Mala Noche drug cartel in Miami.
the letters in blood. "D. E."
he was trying to spell "Delgado.
I just...I don't get it. Why is a big-time gangster wasting time with a nobody like Jeremy Sikes?
I have an idea about that.
turns out, a month ago, Delgado walked in on a robbery at his house.
he got shot, and his girlfriend called it in.
you think Sikes was the robber.
I do, and the DEA has had Delgado under surveillance.
check out this photo. He's wearing the same ring that Sikes pawned at Ruby's.
where is Delgado now?
owns a strip club off of Flamingo.
I hope these gentlemen are up to date with their carry permits.
what do you want, Detective?
I'm the bearer of good news.
you recognize him? His name is Jeremy Sikes.
no. Should I?
the guy died two nights ago. Two shots in the back, bullets dug out.
sound familiar? This is the guy who robbed your house.
I didn't file any police report.
Yeah, well, we recovered this item, pawned by Sikes.
that's my ring.
Yeah, well, no police report, I can't return it to you. Even in prison.
I think you have me mistaken for somebody else, Detective.
you say he was killed two nights ago?
you see, my mother, she's very sick. Two nights ago, I was staying with her.
I can prove it. I mean, you can prove it.
so the jury's in; Luis Delgado is a beautiful son.
DEA surveillance just alibied him out.
okay, but that doesn't mean that he didn't get one of his own guys to do it for him.
that's true, but the rep on Delgado is that he's very hands-on.
so where does this leave us?
I think we have the right motive, but the wrong person.
so, Kristi Holt and Luis Delgado both talked about Sikes breaking into their houses, and in both cases, they walked in on him.
what if they weren't the only ones?
maybe another homeowner walks in on Sikes, gets a good look at him when he's in their house, two nights ago sees him again in the alley, after he was rolled by Alonzo Pierce.
I think we have to pull more case files.
Yeah, I agree. Go back to the pawnshop.
see what else Jeremy Sikes pawned for cash.
okay, what do we got?
22 items from Ruby's Pawn Shop, all pawned by Jeremy Sikes in the last six months.
and all of them can be traced forensically back to five B-and-Es, including the break-ins at Kristi Holt's and Luis Delgado's.
these aren't your ordinary B-and-Es.
in all five cases, the homeowners walked in on the robbery.
according to this, walked into a bullet.
Yeah, well, five B-and-Es, four murders and one attempted.
only Delgado escaped death.
so what are we supposed to believe? This Jeremy Sikes is just one unlucky burglar?
I thought we agreed that luck wasn't a player here.
no, the shootings weren't an accident, and the robberies were cover stories.
remember how Kristi Holt left her husband's watch off of the insurance claim?
well, the same goes for all of these homeowners.
22 items stolen, and not one of them reported by the victims' survivors?
I mean, personally, I... we think that it's payment for services rendered.
I agree.
we had a case like this up in Seattle.
low-rent hit man for hire ring.
advertised in the personals. Called themselves "problem solvers.
they're pretty good, too. Flew under the radar for a long time.
so how'd you bust them?
caught a break. Turned out one of the hit men was a coke addict.
burned through his money, started sh off his mouth, I guess he became a liability.
cause the head guy decided to hit the hit man.
so Jeremy Sikes became a liability.
only instead of blow, it was blackjack.
all this loot, he should've been flush, but instead, he was living on the streets with his last $200.
sounds like a liability to me.
one that the broker decided to eliminate by framing Delgado.
the only question is: Who's the broker?
Kristi, in addition to your husband's watch, we also recovered these other items that were stolen by Jeremy Sikes.
the...the man who broke into my house.
and murdered your husband, Simon.
that's roughly, we figure, about $5, 000 worth right there.
that's an awful lot of valuable stuff to forget to report, don't you think?
listen, we know that you...you bought this watch for Simon for your...your anniversary, right?
but you did not buy this bracelet for him. Someone else did. Another woman.
we traced the purchase back to a... Tiana Lee.
Oh, come on, Kristi, we understand. I mean...you're working two jobs, right?
and you're still in debt because Simon spends the money as fast as you can make it.
what happened?
you came back from work one night, he wasn't there.
he was out again. Then he shows up.
maybe he's drunk.
and you ask him,"Where were you? What were you doing?
maybe he hits you.
maybe he does that a lot.
and then, one day, someone, a friend, suggests a solution.
and all you can think about is getting rid of that pain, all that sadness.
we know that, in your heart, you are not a killer.
and that you...you feel guilty about all of this.
but this is your chance to get rid of some of that guilt.
by telling us the truth right now.
but you're right.
about Simon. About the friend.
that person gave me an e-mail address of a broker.
I was told to follow instructions.
they were going to make it look like a robbery, and I was told to leave certain items off the report.
to pay the hit man.
I wasn't lying when I said that I never met the guy.
him just...sitting at my table and going on that insane run was just...
dumb luck?
what about the broker?
I paid $5, 000 up front, and they set up a meet.
you remember where?
at a pawnshop.
is this the guy that you paid?
no. I think he runs the place. The broker's a woman. Older.
she said she hangs out there.
Russell. When?
what now?
somebody just went into Ruby's Pawn Shop, shot the place up.
Akers, what the hell happened?
according to Ms. Banks, two armed men entered.
they were looking for something. She doesn't know what.
they shot her son, Kyle. Took her other son, Zeke.
okay. Thanks.
who would do something like this?
I don't know. But I think you do.
excuse me?
Kristi Holt gave you up.
we know Jeremy Sikes worked for you as a hit man, and we have a pretty good idea how you terminated his employment.
what is wrong with you people?
my son is lying there dead, and now they've got my other boy, Zeke.
ruby, it's over.
I didn't kill Sikes. But I know who did-- it was Delgado.
I mean, the word on the street is it's his signature.
two shots to the back, bullets dug out. Sikes even tried to write Delgado's name.
that is one hell of a story.
but word on my street is that you're a sociopath.
you're the one who killed Jeremy Sikes...
and framed Delgado.
and you know exactly who came here and why.
if you don't come clean, you're going to lose another son.
come on, Ruby. We know how much you love your boy.
okay, you're right. I killed Sikes, but...
my boys didn't know anything about the side business.
Sikes stole this cigar box from Delgado, and it wasn't even worth anything-- it was a few hundred bucks
but what was inside was worth a lot more.
it was 100 grand in heroin.
where are the drugs?
I sold them.
but Delgado's guys don't know this.
Zeke, he wanted to protect me, so he lied to them.
he said he knew what they wanted and he would take them to it.
when Delgado finds out that he lied, he's going to kill him.
back again so soon?
Where's the kid, Delgado?
what kid?
I know you got him in some basement, beating the hell out of him, but he doesn't know anything.
you're not going to get your drugs back because his mother has already sold them.
they're gone.
are you going to make me ask you again? Where is he?!
I think you need to start showing me a little more respect.
this is my house. - Yeah, right.
look, your lapdog is going to mess on the rug.
if he doesn't get his hand off his gun...
Or...what are you going to do about it?
now that I have your attention...
you tell me where the kid is, and we all go home.
or we all got to die sometime.
you're new in town, so here's your play.
here's what the guys in Vegas used to say-- in the old Vegas:
it's your house, it's your rules.
you got that right.
I think you got yourself a fan.
no, he just likes the way I handle power tools.
no, I wasn't talking about him.
well, congratulations. You got your solve.
no. You take it.
I mean, you earned it. I'll catch the next one.
maybe I'll catch it with you.
I'll see you around.
Yeah.
this is nice.
I'm glad you could finally get a night off.
you should thank Finn. She's covering for me.
you have a...a great group of people here, D.B.
they work so well together, and they're like a family.
you should feel good about that.
I do.
Charlie-- has he made any decisions yet?
no. Not yet.
and what about you?
what's going on?
this last trip to Seattle, I made a pilgrimage to that neighborhood that we used to love to drive through, with the house on the hill, with the view.
I remember.
we used to fantasize walking up to the front door, knocking and asking if they would sell it to us.
I did that.
and they're an older couple, and they're very open to the idea.
okay, don't look at me like that.
you're serious?
we have a house here.
we've talked about this before. You can't do this job forever.
and I don't want to wait forever for this house.
Where's this coming from?
I'm worried about you.
I think...I think this job is getting to you.
it's not. I'm fine.
I don't believe that.
well, I'm fine.
I'm sorry. Come here.
my work here isn't done yet, but when it is, when that day comes, you and I will go back up to Seattle, and we'll...we'll both knock on that door together.
I promise.
I accept.
we invite the Ritthamels for wine and they don't show up?
I mean, really, what's next?
Honey...what's that?
I don't think that's the Ritthamels.
mother of...
male, Caucasian, in his 30s.
and this is how he rolls.
volume of blood loss, lack of visible cardio activity. He's definitely dead.
couldn't have traveled far.
these folks recognize him as a neighbor?
Yes, Bryce and Bunny. They never saw him before, so police officers are knocking on doors asking the neighbors if anyone witnessed his wild ride.
well, what do you think, David?
this doesn't look like the kind of damage you'd get from just being tumbled around, does it?
I think you're right.
severe blunt-force injuries, primarily to the head and face.
so, obviously a murder.
have you ever seen anything like this?
actually, I have.
it's a human hamster ball, I believe.
saw one of these at the state fair with Charlie once.
it's airtight, waterproof, you can roll around in a pool for five bucks until you lose your corn dogs.
state fair corn dogs.
that sounds slightly more fun than this guy's experience.
all right, so we have to figure out who he is, where he came from and what in the spinning world happened to him.
our entire crime scene is inside of this bubble, David, so I want you to get this back to the coroner's office, intact.
Seriously? Y-You want me to put that... in my van?
that'd be nice.
have a ball.
heard you guys have a big, bloody ball of bad to work on.
well, grave shift always gets the good ones.
glad us swing shift guys are done.
heard you got a sexual assault call, too.
gonna be a busy night.
I'll drink my first one for you, huh?
let him gloat.
I don't really like anybody that goes to bed before sunrise, anyways.
agreed.
Hey, Morgan? The sexual assault call.
it's got to be our guy. Similar victim and location.
Oh, sorry. Dawn. Banks. Swing shift.
seen you around. Greg.
dawn and I worked separate home invasion rapes last week, realized we might be dealing with a serial.
Yeah, looks like he might have struck again.
do, uh, you mind if I work this one with you? I don't sleep anyway.
Oh, um, sure.
great. I can head out to the scene. The victim's waiting at PD.
all right, I'll talk to her.
good luck.
I didn't see him.
I-I didn't hear him.
I didn't know anything happened until I woke up.
tell me what you can about your night, Amy.
what do you remember before you went to bed?
I got off work at 8: 00.
I'm-I'm a cocktail waitress.
fell asleep in bed watching TV.
when I woke up, my head felt all cloudy.
and... I was...hurting.
I promise you, Amy, we're not gonna stop until we hunt this animal down.
I saw something on the news, that a girl got attacked last week a mile from my place.
was this the same guy?
I processed Amy's condo. Point of entry was the back door.
the intruder used a bump key to bust open the lock.
just like the other scenes.
Yeah, I found some rubble, crushed shells, just like the last scene.
confirms it's the same guy.
it's just, this stuff is used to pave so many driveways around town.
could have picked it up anywhere.
found a few small pebbles of a different rocky material.
Oh, and fibers from a chloroform rag.
he knocked Amy out, just like the others.
and then, again with the TV.
the rapist turns it on and leaves it on.
he actually didn't turn it on at Amy's.
she said she likes to fall asleep to the news, so she left it on.
so this time, there's one less thing on his sick, twisted to-do list.
you know them?
Yeah, I-I thought it was my son, Tyler.
I bought him a jacket like that last Christmas.
he's 19. He comes home every couple of weeks.
I try to get him to stay, but then he wants to use in the house, and then he's gone and...
he's just out there.
you said you don't sleep.
you worry.
no I. D. on our victim, so we're hoping that the trace from the outside of the ball will help us determine its path, and where it came from will help us with who he is.
well, however bumpy his path, that's not what killed him.
intracerebral hemorrhage from blunt-force trauma is what bounced him from this mortal coil.
he was beaten with some sort of hard implement.
small striking surface, semicircular lacerations.
there were marks in his second skin, as well.
second skin? I think I missed that anatomy class.
the thin vinyl of the ball was caught between the weapon and the victim.
so the victim was inside the ball, the assailant was outside of it.
and the weapon made distinct tool marks at the points of impact.
what's the brown trace?
those are paint flecks.
so, shape of the marks plus the brown color could help us identify the weapon.
well, at least something good rolled this victim's way.
forensic nurse exam was very helpful.
a swab of Amy Morse's neck found male DNA and amylase.
he kissed her.
Yeah. Unfortunately, there wasn't a hit in CODIS.
but at least now we have a profile on him. So, gets us a little closer.
just not close enough to stop him.
you okay there, Hodges?
you're familiar with the snowball effect?
a sphere in motion tumbles along, picking up mass?
well, the human hamster ball effect is worse. Because it affects me.
to the tune of 37 different plant trace exemplars, each of which I am tasked with identifying.
that sucks.
I like you.
now, before this avalanche came tumbling down on me,
I ran the very reasonable amount of trace that you two brought me.
crushed shell, just like at the previous scene.
what about the other rubble we found at the point of entry?
a little more interesting.
concrete and titanium oxide
otherwise known as smog-eating concrete.
a new, unique material that helps reduce pollution.
the chemical additive is activated by sunlight and turns smoggy toxins into less-harmful compounds upon contact.
so where in Vegas can this stuff be found?
it might help us find our assailant's point of origin.
it's in limited use nationally.
haven't had the chance to determine if or where it might be present in Vegas.
I can look into it. You're busy.
did I mention my fondness for you?
I like her.
all right, so where are we on this rape case?
victimology shows no links between the three rape victims.
none of them knew each other. No shared routines.
no overlaps in their lives.
other than being this guy's type-- early 20s, single, brunette, living alone in a first-floor condo.
the M. O.'s consistent, right?
I mean, he waits until they're asleep, uses a bump key on the back door lock to gain entry.
except that at the first scene, he passes a wide-open window he could've used for entry.
he goes into the victim's bedroom. Chloroforms her.
turns on the TV, leaving it on while he assaults her.
actually, Amy already had her television on, so he just left it playing.
what if it wasn't a coincidence?
maybe it's significant.
you get the feeling that he was more prepared with Amy?
at the first scene, he overlooked the open window.
second scene, he woke up a dog that got the neighbors all excited.
no missteps at Amy's house, and he picked the one night a week that she gets out of work early.
he might've been casing her home, known her habits.
it's more than that.
he knew he was gonna have to use a bump key to break into Amy's house.
he knew that she fell asleep with the TV on.
he re-created those conditions in the previous two scenes, because...
the first two rapes were rehearsals.
practice runs.
I think Amy Morse was his intended target the whole time.
it could be anyone, Amy, um...
a customer, a coworker, a neighbor.
has anyone given you unwanted attention?
I thought this was some random psycho attacking random women.
why would I have known him?
we now believe the rapist may have targeted you specifically.
there is someone.
my ex-boyfriend, Jared... Wallace.
when I broke up with him a couple months ago, he turned awful.
started sending me these e-mails.
when I woke up...after, I...
I could almost smell him in the room.
Jared?
but it...it was so faint, I-I thought I was imagining it, I...
we're gonna need to get a DNA sample from Jared.
do you have anything from when you guys were dating?
hairbrush, um, article of clothing...
I just wanted to forget him.
are you even sure her story's legit?
Amy's a cocktail waitress. That's kind of how she makes money-- leading guys on.
she takes one home and if she regrets it, buff one of the hundred notches out of the bedpost but don't call the cops.
enough, Jared. He doesn't mean that.
this is just a stressful situation.
look, Jared, we're just going to take a swab of your DNA, and then you're free to go.
Yeah, I don't think so.
it'll only take a second.
and last a lifetime in your database.
I said no, and you can't force me unless you have a warrant.
Mr. Wallace, as your son's attorney, perhaps you should advise...
I already told him no, too.
wait a minute.
as his attorney, I have to support his decision.
well, as his dad, don't you think you should tell him to man the hell up?
parent protects his kid no matter what...disgusting thing the kid has done.
dad can't see it.
little boy who used to sit on his lap couldn't be capable of something so awful.
and if you are clear-eyed enough to see what he has done, what does that say about how you raised him?
dad, come on, let's get out of here.
you thought you got whatever you wanted, including Amy, and when you lost her, well...
if we're wrong, prove it.
are you kidding me?
you raped her, Jared.
Jared, no, no, Jared, Jared, Jared. Jared.
you don't know who you're messing with.
you were hoping he would spit at you, right?
big loogie in the face would have been nice, but at least a good look in his eyes let me know we're right about him.
leave the prop alone.
you guys got something to show me?
Yes.
now, you know that a rolling stiff gathers no moss, but it does gather an exhaustive assortment of flora.
that is the plant trace that we took off of the big ball-- Hodges I. D.'d it -
and this is a landscaping map that we got from the subdivision's gardener.
each blade and bloom meticulously plotted and labeled.
so you're looking for one route-- probably downhill -
that makes contact with each of the plant varieties until it ends up in our unfortunate couple's front yard.
took us 17 hours without a bathroom break, but we did it.
so we tracked the ball to its point of origin-- the backyard of one Zack Fisk.
the human hamster himself, rest his cardboard - chewing soul.
back door's open.
wide enough for the hamster ball to roll out.
look at these fresh scuffs. Right height for the ball.
so the ball knocks over the vase, spreads water over the carpet, does a few donuts right here, and out the door.
that is one hell of a ride before he even got out of the house.
he was trying to escape from whoever was wielding this.
same shape as the impressions left in the hamster ball's skin.
paint must have rubbed off during the assault.
texture's not really conducive to prints.
killer might have left this little bit of trace behind.
Hey, Jules, I think I just found this guy's romper room.
Ugh, all kinds of freaky fun.
don't suppose he'll mind us looking at his computer, do you?
ConfinedBliss. com-- a claustrophilia oasis.
I guess that's the opposite of claustrophobia, right?
people who get off on tight spaces.
Zack Fisk is in every video.
well, let's go to the movies.
a ball like this, with a two-way zipper, is perfect for solo or partner play.
when sealed up, the ball contains 20 minutes' worth of oxygen, so, in 15 minutes, the air will be thinning and my lovely playmate will be...in bliss.
claustrophilia can bring you to full sensory nirvana.
the lack of space, of oxygen makes you deliciously aware of every inch and impulse of your body.
with the strictest of boundaries comes the most exhilarating liberation.
speaking of oxygen, I could use a little.
since Zack was killed inside of the ball, his playmate's a pretty good suspect, right?
I'll figure out who she is.
I got it.
yeah?
package delivered.
huh, big package shows up a day after he's murdered. Could be connected.
what do you think? Should we open it?
Yeah.
Oh, Lord.
well, whatever new pervy toys this guy just ordered, I think he went with solid steel.
that is no toy.
no, that's his playmate.
dawn, it's Morgan again, following up on the case.
uh, I really need to hear from you.
I'm just hoping you're, you're okay.
please call me back. Bye.
everything all right?
Oh, uh, Dawn Banks-- she didn't show up for her shift today.
when's the last time you talked to her?
yesterday, after she got in the face of our rape suspect Jared Wallace.
well, do you want to do a welfare check, swing by her house?
Yeah.
door's unlocked.
looks like she left this place in a hurry.
Yeah.
she was working.
she got a response from a smog-eating concrete company last night.
rapist tracked some of that stuff into the crime scenes, right?
Yeah, and according to this e-mail, this stuff only exists on one half-mile strip of Verdugo Road.
good lead.
the hell are you guys doing here, huh?!
who are you guys? - We're CSIs.
it's her son.
we work with your mom.
so, when's the last time you saw her?
look, I don't know where she is.
okay, I haven't been here in weeks. I just came to get a bite.
sure.
if she got fed up with me, everything else, ran off to the Bahamas or something, good for her, she deserves it.
other than that, I don't know what else to tell you.
I'm gonna get out of here, crash somewhere else.
uh, Tyler, wait.
I know you have your own life and everything, but I know your mom has been really, really worried about you.
I think you should stay.
Yeah, I'm sure she'd be happy to see you.
look, I'm sorry.
if I see her, then I'll tell her someone else is looking out for her.
Thanks.
Hey, Brody, I heard you're on the rape case. Stealing the glory again?
day shift doesn't start for another hour, Yeager. Go get your breakfast buffet on.
no. No carbs until I make CSI-3.
bumped into Sidle.
she looped me in on the rape investigation. So, what do you have?
uh, suspect tracked two different materials into the scene.
one was, uh, crushed shells and the other was a smog-eating concrete, and I found one location where both of these materials exist-- this trailer park.
so you think the rapist may have originated from there?
Yeah, but it still doesn't clear our prime suspect-- victim's ex Jared Wallace.
now, I thought he was some rich kid, not some trailer type.
well, this particular trailer park has a lot of drug activity, and Wallace has an ecstasy charge on his record.
okay, so Wallace swings by to score something before the rapes.
there's something else.
I think Dawn figured this out before I did and now she's missing.
Yeah, I heard-- no-show today.
I've worked with her. That's not like Dawn.
case had her amped, so I'm thinking maybe she found the same location.
could be she ran into our suspect.
this e-mail was the last thing up on her computer.
maybe she went to follow up.
went to the trailer park, and then...
Oh, you think something happened to her?
I don't know.
all right. I'll drive.
okay, the manager did not recognize Dawn or Jared Wallace, but he said people are in and out all hours.
he give you a list of the residents?
no, he refused. Suggested we move along.
it's okay.
we can do it another way.
you trying Dawn again?
Yeah.
Morgan. Try her again.
nothing here.
this way.
where the hell is she?
time for the "postal mortem"?
no I. D. from prints or DNA.
well, lividity's fixed.
it indicates her orientation in the box. She was upside down.
so she was inverted during transit.
well, autopsy will confirm, but I'd venture positional asphyxia was likely the cause of death.
gravity causes the organs to impede the diaphragmatic movement.
no movement of the diaphragm, no breathing, suffocation.
there aren't any wounds evident on her.
it doesn't appear she was forced into the box.
that's bizarre.
well, yes and no.
this woman was a claustrophiliac.
which means that she liked to get off by getting into tight spaces.
the babe in the box is named Melody Davis.
the package was shipped from her residence across town 36 hours ago.
I also lifted some prints from the label.
match to Zack Fisk.
so Fisk sealed his playmate up at her house, mailed her to his house to have a thrill?
there's a catch. Melody is married to a guy named Roy Davis.
brass is breaking the news and bringing him in.
your wife's death was accidental.
she got into that box voluntarily -
it's part of her...claustrophilia pursuits that she indulged in with her friend Zack Fisk.
but I suspect you knew all about this, right?
Yes, sir, I did.
I allowed it...to save my marriage.
she said she needed her space. Or...lack of space.
she had met a man online, but she said it wasn't sex, it was just...play.
and a couple of hours after your wife put herself in the box and mailed herself,
I guess you got online and tracked the package on your home computer?
she had told me about her shipping fantasy before.
but I forbid it.
it's far too dangerous.
but apparently, she hadn't heeded me.
you saw the package was delivered to, uh, Zack Fisk, so you went over there and confronted him, huh?
no, sir. That is not true.
Roy, what, uh, what line of work you in?
I...work on a ranch. Horses. Wide-open spaces.
Yeah, see, that was a trick question.
we found a kernel of your special blend of horse feed.
it was stuck to the murder weapon.
I mean, you gave this guy Fisk a lot of leeway with your own wife, but he had to push it, right?
he thought he was safe in that stupid bubble.
so damn smug.
I told you guys, that's where I drew the line. If she gets hurt...
she's on the ride of her life.
more excitement than you've ever given her.
and you just wait until she arrives, and I get to tear into that pretty little package.
it was just play, she told me.
I'm sorry about your wife, Roy. I really am.
unfortunately, you're gonna have to share her love of enclosed spaces.
so, PD towed in Dawn's car.
found it roadside in the middle of nowhere.
searched the immediate area-- nothing unusual, and no viable prints on the outside.
get to the inside yet?
no, not yet.
all right, I'll take the front.
I got a receipt...from a truck stop.
1: 00 a. m.the night she went missing. 30 bucks.
does it say what she bought?
I've got an evidence bag.
that looks like a T-shirt.
dawn might have gone rogue.
you know, stealing a DNA sample from Jared Wallace or maybe a suspect from the trailer park.
the guy could've caught up with her and...stopped her.
I think the threat was closer to home.
her suspect was her son.
Tyler, your mom's car was found abandoned on the highway.
she was working a serial rape case.
she was transporting collected evidence in her car.
now, we think because of the sequence of events and the timing of everything that she identified the suspect, who tracked her to the highway location and confronted her.
Where's my mom?
we pulled your rap sheet. You're a registered sex offender.
Yeah, for taking a leak in an alleyway.
you've been convicted of burglary.
what does this have to do with anything?
the rape victim, Amy Morse, the one whose case your mom was working on, you knew her.
you went to Sagebrush High with her.
okay. There's 2, 000 kids at that school! I don't know her.
your mom collected a DNA sample from the rapist.
she also collected a DNA sample from you.
right now, the lab is comparing them.
look, you got to get my mom.
where is she, Tyler? Where's your mom?
captain. - Not now, Officer.
a detective's come from Reno-- you've got to hear this.
take him out in the hallway.
how you doing? Jim Brass.
detective Smith. Reno PD.
I hear that you've been looking for CSI Dawn Banks.
Yeah, that's right.
she was supposed to be coming up our way-- never showed.
what was she doing with Reno PD?
she was coming up to identify her deceased son, Tyler.
that's her son right there in the hallway.
okay, let's step back. Tell me what you know.
two nights ago, Reno officers found a deceased male in a warehouse where homeless kids were known to squat.
overdose. Badly decomposed.
had a driver's license identifying him as Tyler Banks.
I called Ms. Banks to break the news.
she was at a trailer park working a case.
she was devastated.
said that she had always feared a call like this about her son.
she was gonna collect a DNA exemplar from home and drive it up, confirm I. D.
she never showed.
so that's why Dawn Banks was taking a DNA sample of Tyler.
he wasn't her suspect.
she thought he was dead.
Henry ran Tyler's DNA against the rapist. He's clear.
apparently, Tyler lent his I. D. to a buddy of his, a homeless guy who was heading up to Reno.
so his buddy O. D.'s, decomposes beyond recognition, cops go off the I. D. in his pocket.
all right. So, let's run this.
you get the call that your son is dead, and you pick up a piece of his laundry for DNA so you can I. D. him.
you start driving up to Reno where the body is.
right.
Except...the road that her car ends up on is not on the way to Reno.
I found a receipt in Dawn's car from a truck stop, and the truck stop...is at the junction of 95 and 373.
that's when she started driving south, away from Reno.
so maybe the truck stop is where she changed her mind, and her route.
the question is: Where was she going?
Tyler, I need to ask you a question.
is there, um, any place off of Highway 373 that may have meant something to your mom?
Why?
your mom thought you were dead.
your I. D. was on a young man who overdosed in Reno.
she was driving out to identify your body, and, for some reason, she changed her mind.
she stopped at a truck stop, and, uh...
we pulled the surveillance footage.
it looks like she bought...vodka and acetaminophen.
s-so she's...
no, no, listen. W-We don't know that, but we think that maybe, if she was going to do something to herself, she might have chosen a place that was significant.
she used to take me camping out there. But, I mean, i-it was forever ago.
okay, show me. Show me where.
good boy.
this favorite spot Tyler told you about, are you sure it's this way?
that's what he said. But he and his mom haven't been here in several years.
he was a little hazy.
well, if Dawn's up here, how many hours has it been?
over there. Come on.
she's got a pulse.
control, this is Adam-Zero-Four Yeager.
we have CSI Banks. North trail, about a half-mile in.
send medics. Code three.
dawn? Come on.
dawn, wake up, please.
Tyler is alive. He's okay.
come on. Stay with us, Dawn.
dawn, help's on the way.
Hey, boss. Got your text.
how's CSI Banks?
Oh, she's in ICU. Morgan's with her.
good. Uh, what's up?
we still have a serial rapist out there with some kind of connection to that trailer park.
want you to grab Henry, go out there and go through all the trash cans you can find.
if you come up with any biologicals, run them against our rapist's DNA.
we need to find out if he's still in one of those trailers.
all right, I'm on it.
thank you.
doing noble work here, ma'am.
check this out.
so they got top-of-the-line locks, security cam.
they're treating a dinged-up trailer like it's Fort Knox.
paranoid, or protecting something?
couple of wadded-up tissues.
I know what I'm running first.
DNA matches our rapist.
we've got him.
LVPD!
all clear.
come on, Henry.
surveillance cam's not hooked up. It's just for show.
young brunettes.
just like Amy and the other victims.
I got pics of Amy with Jared Wallace, and, uh, other mementos.
Jared, I hope what we have will last forever. Amy.
certainly lasted in his mind.
guy rents this trailer to obsess and prepare in private.
becomes his base when he starts to act out on his obsession.
did some acting here, too. I'll swab.
heart medication. Swiped Daddy's prescription.
a gray hair.
it's not Jared.
it's Dad.
I guess I can understand, Mr. Wallace.
this whole event started innocently at first.
you know, son brings home his girlfriend to meet Dad.
she's attractive. Dad likes her. He notices her.
he liked having Amy around, so he invites her to family picnics, outings, but then things get weird.
dad gets kind of jealous of son. Right?
you also took from him, too. You took his jacket, his love letters.
and you took from Amy, too.
you know, we asked Amy about you.
what did she say?
she said,"Ken Wallace walked in on me once or twice in the shower,"but it was innocent.
he was sweet, clumsy, older man. Nothing sexual about him.
so you had to change that, so, when Amy broke up with Jared, about a week later, you know, and you're gonna lose her, too, you decided to do something about it.
get a funky old trailer, hired some brunette hookers.
got their DNA from the sheets.
but you stepped over the line.
you started to prowl around condos just like Amy's.
started to stalk young women, brunettes, just like Amy.
you broke into their house.
you broke into their bedroom to act out your sick rape fantasies, all in preparation... for Amy.
Amy was worth it.
the woman...is a miracle.
Jared had her, he messed it up.
when I had my chance with her...
I made it perfect.
doctors say your mom's gonna pull through.
I never wanted to hurt her.
I know.
or make it easy for her to believe I'd end up dead that way.
you know, I-I just keep thinking about how cold she was out there.
you know, I could've told her, sleeping outside sucks.
she's going to need you, Tyler, more than ever.
I swear to God, I'm not leaving the house for a second.
I'm done...with everything, everyone else.
just let her be okay.
please let her be okay.
911 operator. What's your emergency?
I'm at the Sky View Motel. I was making a delivery.
you have to send someone. I think they're dead.
slow down, sir.
I don't know for sure, but...
you need to tell me what happened. Are there people injured?
there's blood. There's blood everywhere.
well, it's a messy one.
if you don't believe me, ask the pizza delivery guy there.
Yeah, is he the one who called it in?
Yeah, he was delivering pizzas to, uh, one of the rooms nearby.
the door to 114 was ajar, so he looked in.
what do we have?
two victims. Mr. and Mrs. Smith.
Oh, that's original. Anybody know who they really are?
no. And I don't know what they did to deserve this.
talk to me, David.
I'm trying to determine the number of stab wounds.
but, frankly, there are just too many to count.
this is disturbing.
Hey, wait a minute. You know something? I've been here.
Yeah, we had that OD out on the street a while back.
Yeah, yeah, in the motel, but I mean, in this room-- this exact one.
I-I've been here. Room 114.
I remember the view of the neon from that window.
this is it.
you're right. We have been here before.
Yeah, it was a dismemberment murder; victim was in his 20s.
it was about, uh, two months ago.
no, I think it was more recent.
it was another couple, but the woman was bludgeoned... in her sleep.
I am pretty sure it was the dismemberment.
I'm sorry, but-but you're both right.
I've been here twice before, once for the dismemberment and again for the couple.
and now this.
anybody else getting a really bad feeling about this place?
yeah... yeah, this the world's most unlucky motel room.
all right, that's three murder scenes all in the same spot.
they got to be related, don't you think?
maybe there's a connection between the victims or the killer has a weird fixation of some kind.
I don't think I'm ready to talk about past crimes yet.
have to focus on this one first.
Yeah, I hear you. I'll take the bathroom.
so, how long have you been manager here?
uh, since about the time I learned to walk.
my parents built this place, so... I grew up here.
all mine now.
do you have any idea who might've done this?
isn't that your business to figure that out?
I mean, I know we're not the Bellagio, but if I have to drop the rates any lower, I might as well just board the place up.
Yeah. So, you got about, what, uh, 20 rooms here?
tell me about the people who stay in them.
it's like the sign says.
I mean, by the night, by the week and by the month.
I'm gonna need a list of names.
well, that could be a problem.
not that I wouldn't give it, it's just... I don't have it.
come on, man. The place is 39 bucks a night.
if people have cash, what do I care about their names?
look, none of 'em are killers, though-- trust me.
how do you know that?
well, there's no one here that interesting.
looks like the Smiths had a guest last night.
the towels are damp, and I found a red hair in the shower drain.
hmm, that doesn't match either of our victims.
and there were three toothbrushes around the sink.
uh, I found a receipt for one.
it's from the drugstore around the corner-- last night.
so a guest they didn't plan on. - There's more.
they also bought shampoo and a pair of scissors, which have since disappeared.
could be the murder weapon.
so there was someone in here before the killing started.
Yeah, who showered and-- I don't know.
judging from the toothbrush, might've been planning on staying the night.
so what went wrong?
I've been doing this long enough that nothing shocks me, but if a case could...
just the sheer savagery involved.
more than a hundred stab wounds in each victim.
certainly beyond what was necessary, if the goal was to simply kill them. Can I see that?
it's, uh, way beyond what we sometimes see with crimes of passion or extreme anger.
this was madness.
their names really were Smith. Richard and Ann.
according to family, they were in from Flagstaff for an antique toy and collectibles convention.
that would explain the dolls in the room.
sounds like they were solid people.
she volunteered, ran pet therapy at an old folks home.
he worked with the homeless.
squeaky clean.
course, that wouldn't be the first time the squeaky-clean have indulged their dark side here in Vegas.
they could've invited somebody back to the room, spice up their life a little bit.
if so... certainly got more than they bargained for.
Hey. So, I... pulled the files for the other two motel murder scenes.
it's weird, don't you think? That a killer would fixate on one room?
what do you think the significance is?
why does he feel the need to kill there?
well, that's assuming that these are all the work of one killer.
it could be that there's no connection.
that you're looking for patterns where there are none.
so it's a coincidence that three totally unrelated killers chose this one room?
I'm just saying, we don't know yet.
all right, first one: Mark Bell.
11 weeks ago, he stayed in Room 114 after his girlfriend kicked him out.
Yeah, I remember. I worked this case with Finn.
the maid found him tied to the bed, severe lacerations to his legs.
they were nearly cut off. He bled to death.
there was a bloody knife found on the floor.
too smeared to yield any viable prints.
detectives, at the time, thought the attack was related to a drug debt.
they thought the dealer was sending a message.
four weeks ago... second attack in the room.
Alex and Tina Garnez. Nick and I handled this one.
their house had been foreclosed on.
they were living in their car for months.
Mr. Garnez finally got a job.
moving to the motel was supposed to be a step up.
that night, he was sneaking a cigarette in the bathroom while his wife slept.
the killer started with his wife, clubbing her while she was sleeping.
then he must've surprised Mr. Garnez in the bathroom...
No! - Overpowered him.
he survived. He's still in the hospital recovering.
and then last night... the Smiths.
still think we're... dealing with random, unrelated events?
all right, Finn, I'll see you back at the lab.
come on now. Open up. I saw you in there.
I was asleep last night. I was not involved. I already told the cops.
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's cool. I'm not, uh... I'm not here to grill you.
kind of looks like you like to call this place home.
I'm guessing you see everything that goes on in here.
you... didn't see anything weird?
anybody suspicious running around here lately?
it's not my place to judge another man in that way.
only God can judge.
right... well, God would want you to help me catch a killer, wouldn't he?
I'm sorry.
now, sir, please, please, hey, come on, now.
a couple was violently murdered last night.
a woman a few weeks ago. A young man before that.
all in the same room, all innocent victims.
innocent? There's no one on this planet who's innocent.
we're all sinners.
Yeah, yeah, well, that-that doesn't really help me do my job.
they were called to God. That's God's plan.
your job is done.
Yeah, I just...
might be my biggest regret about this job...
I know way too much about hotel bedspreads.
and hotel carpets. Don't go barefoot.
so, we have three different bedspreads from our... three different crime scenes.
I ran the DNA.
the bedspread on the left is from the very first murder scene.
I'm guessing it lived in that room for who knows how long.
long enough that I was able to identify 26 individual DNA profiles.
Yeah. The replacement bedspread there was only in the room for seven weeks.
so fewer contributions. - 16 of them.
and the third bedspread, from last night's crime scene.
yielded only nine contributors.
but here's the thing:
one of them, a male, is common to all three bedspreads.
one person, the same person was in the room before each of the murders?
have you run the samples through CODIS?
it's running right now.
here we go.
Randall Wicks, 22.
he must have just been added to the system.
there's why-- sexual battery charge two weeks ago.
look where he was arrested.
that same motel. The same room!
I'll call Brass, get out a broadcast.
Oh, how the mighty have fallen, huh, Randall?
you used to be the featured dancer in the Tangiers All Male Review.
how'd you let that gig slip away?
I don't know. I got bored, so I quit.
well, or maybe you found something more interesting to do, huh?
Oh, hey, man, what the hell?
three separate murders in the same room at the Sky View Motel.
your DNA was found in the room after each of the crimes.
what?
wait a minute-- Sky View Motel? Was that in room 114?
I use that room, frequently. For business.
so... you're a prostitute?
dude, I'm a stud, letting frustrated housewives get a taste of something they wouldn't even get close to otherwise.
okay, stud, what about the housewife you beat up in room 114?
the sexual battery charge.
or was that just part of the pony ride experience?
that was self-defense.
I'm serious. I was in fear for my life.
okay... I meet this woman there, right? Totally normal at first.
then we start getting into it, and... I don't know, she goes all crazy.
starts hallucinating or something, screaming at the walls.
pure freak show.
and why? What would make her do that?
well, I ain't a doctor or nothing, but... must be the sex just blew her mind.
Yeah, that must have been it.
well... aside from being a complete tool, what do you think?
well, he still could be our killer.
well, the problem is, all we have is DNA evidence, and we can't disprove his story of how it got in that room.
well, we do have an eyewitness who could possibly I. D. Randall.
Alex Garnez, the husband who survived his wife being bludgeoned four weeks ago.
he has massive head injuries.
he's still in the hospital-- we don't even know what condition he's in.
well, I talked to his doctor. She said he's struggling psychologically.
they have him on suicide watch after one failed attempt, but physically... she said he's strong enough to talk to us.
Mr. Garnez.
I'm CSI Brody, and this is CSI Sanders.
I'm sorry, but we need to talk to you about the night that you and your wife were attacked.
how much do you remember?
I don't know. I...
I... I remember her just lying there, just lying there.
and all the... blood around her...
we were high school sweethearts.
did you see the person who hurt you and your wife?
do you remember his face?
I can see him...standing over her, hitting her over... and over...and... and I'm powerless.
I... I can't stop him.
like there's a wall between us. I...
yet I can still hear the sickening sound of...blow... after blow.
Mr. Garnez... we want to...
we want to show you some photographs of some faces.
we need you to tell us if any one of these men looks like the man that we've been talking about, okay?
he's not there. - Are you sure?
none of these... is the man that killed my Tina.
Hodges, you texted me "911"? - I did.
what is the 911?
sorry. Your suspect.
he ran from the motel room barefoot, correct?
yet he left no shoes behind.
he could have been carrying his shoes.
he was in too much of a hurry to put them on.
mm, maybe. But there was a bottle of shampoo that Nick found in the bathroom.
it contained one percent permethrin, formulated to combat head lice.
now, I've checked with Doc.
neither of the Smiths were head lice sufferers.
so the shampoo was for the guest.
Yes. Presumably the killer.
Nick found residue on the wall of the shower.
I've tested it; it contained five percent permethrin.
permethrin, for the head lice.
no. This is five percent, in a body cream.
it's prescription strength, used to treat scabies.
I don't want to seem insensitive, but...
Shoeless, head lice, and scabies，that all sounds like homeless to me.
richard Smith worked with the homeless back in Flagstaff.
he could have been doing some sort of outreach, wanted to help somebody, brought them in off the street.
I've already called around.
there's a local shelter called Street Saviors who had a scabies outbreak last week, where they distributed this very same prescription cream.
way to bury the lead, Hodges.
that's part of my charm. It's all in the telling.
so I talked to a couple of the outreach workers.
they saw a guy earlier, a guy named Rudy.
he's a regular here. He was barefoot, had bloodstained clothes.
sounds like our boy. - Yeah.
according to the locals, he likes to hang out here, under the bridge.
anybody seen Rudy? Huh?
you seen Rudy?
you know who Rudy is?
Hey, where does Rudy stay?
Hey, old-timer. Hey, man.
you seen Rudy anywhere?
what's wrong?
what have you been doing, man?
Rudy, you're gonna have to come with us.
Rudy, it says here in my files that you spent some time in the state hospital.
had a few psych holds?
Yeah, I have some problems.
what did the doctors diagnose you with?
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety, paranoia...
well, that's okay. We get the idea.
do you recognize these two? Richard and Ann?
they're angels. - What do you mean?
they rescued me. - How?
I was on the street, out front of a drugstore on Cramer.
Oh, that's right near the Sky View Motel.
I go there sometimes to ask for change, you know, and-and I...
these guys, they jumped me and-and...and they beat me, and they took my change and they took my shoes.
and-and it probably would have been worse, except that Richard and Ann came along out of nowhere and...and chased them away.
Rudy, what happened next?
I told you, they're angels.
they asked me if I wanted to stay in their room with them, and they got me a toothbrush and stuff, and they let me get a shower and get all cleaned up.
did something happen after the shower?
something happened, didn't it?
I don't know. I don't remember.
come on, Rudy, think. Think real hard.
No! No!
there were these dolls...
a-and there were a whole bunch of them, and they started talking to me and they were looking at me.
what were they saying, Rudy? What did they say?
did the dolls tell you to do this?
I...
I did that, didn't I? I did that with the scissors.
I hurt them.
what about these people?
did you hurt them, too?
I don't know.
you know, sometimes I think we forget what delicate, complex machines we are.
you know, all it takes are a few short-circuiting synapses, or a breakdown in myelination, and everything gets thrown out of whack.
Jules, you just captured a killer.
I know. Then why do I feel so bad?
because he seems like a nice guy who got dealt a lousy hand in life.
so we have him for killing the Smiths, right?
what about the other two attacks?
well, I could go over all the evidence and make a case.
he's obviously our prime suspect.
he frequented the area, and he's obviously unstable.
good work. You put some long hours in on this.
why-why don't you go home, get yourself some rest.
take it, take it easy!
one plus one is two. One for me and one for you.
two plus two is four. That's a couple more.
three plus three is six. Straight and crooked sticks!
get away!
one plus one is two. One for me and one for you.
two plus two is four, and that's a couple more.
one plus one is two. One for me and one for you.
two plus two is four. That's a couple more. Three plus three is six.
ma'am. - Straight and crooked sticks.
you need to drop that bottle, do you hear me?
four plus four is eight. Seagulls on the gate! Five plus five is ten.
do you hear what I'm saying? ! drop the bottle!
Ricky doesn't follow directions! He never follows directions!
Thanks, man. Seriously, thanks. Thanks.
all right.
was she staying here? In the motel?
uh, yeah, just since tonight.
what room?
it's happened again.
how the hell can this be? I thought we had our killer.
did we mess up, Jules?
did we make a mistake with our-our homeless guy?
no, Rudy's guilty, maybe not of all three, but he definitely killed the Smiths.
then how do we explain this? - I don't know. It has to be... unrelated.
unrelated? Four murders in the same room over a three-month period.
that's got to be connected, don't you think?
all right, I'm sorry.
look, all right, who are our players tonight?
who are we talking about here?
suspect is a woman, 28-year-old high school math teacher.
victim was one of her students.
together in a sleazy, $39-a-night motel room.
with lingerie, condoms, sex toys and alcohol.
wonder what was going on here, right?
Yeah, according to the school Web site, she was just named Teacher of the Year.
I'll bet she was.
so, this may sound crazy, but I'm thinking that this isn't what it looks like.
I don't believe that the teacher was sleeping with her student.
Yeah, you're right, that sounds crazy.
well, listen to this voice mail I found on her phone.
ms. Stone, it's Matthew.
I don't know what to do, but my parents have been drinking and fighting, and I can't go home; I'm at a motel.
but I'm scared. I don't know who else to call.
I'm sorry, but you have to help me, please.
ms. Stone, we are trying to make sense out of what happened in that room.
but we need your help to do that.
boy, Matthew must have told you a really sad story to lure you to that motel room.
now, obviously, from the items he brought along, he had ideas of getting romantic with you.
now, there were a lot of empty liquor bottles in the room.
was the young man drunk?
there wasn't any drinking.
first thing I did was dump all the alcohol down the sink.
I wanted it clear to Matthew that nothing was going to happen.
did he get upset? Is that when he threatened you?
he would never.
Matthew's a... Matthew's a great kid.
he just had a harmless crush, that's all.
he would never hurt me.
then why did you kill him?
it wasn't me.
Really? Wasn't you?
ms. Stone, look, look at this.
that's not me.
I mean, it's me, it's my body, but I...
I had no control. It was like there was something inside me.
I was... ...possessed.
you were what?
I was...
I don't know. Part of me really wants to believe her.
I mean, the woman ranting and screaming on that video from last night was nothing like the woman I met today.
they were two totally different people.
so, her behavior last night was completely out of character.
did the hospital do a tox screen?
Yeah, it was clean. Not even alcohol.
then it's got to be the room.
the room made her do it.
what, like, The Shining? Hmm? The Overlook Hotel?
it's the one thing connecting all of the murders.
right now, it's the only thing.
okay, so, let's have Hodges and Henry drag their equipment out there and test the room, see what they have to say.
I've got some elevated VOCs in the air conditioner, but nothing that would explain any of the bizarre behavior.
what about you? You got anything yet?
could I have five minutes to look first?
Oh, and I'm very much enjoying the dirty bathroom. Thank you for that.
great. Now I can smell like a fruit bowl for the rest of the day.
it looks like they've got mold inside the walls of the closet.
I'm going to have to get a sample. Do you have the pry bar in there?
Hey, I have to open some drywall. Do you have the pry bar in your kit?
Seriously?
Hodges, what are you doing? I was calling you.
what are you looking at?
what, what's going on with you?
I know who you are.
okay, look, w-why don't you have a seat on the toilet...
I'm gonna help you out, come here.
I can see what you are!
Hodges, let go of me! That hurts!
no... Hodges!
no, no...!
this is Henry Andrews. I'm at the Sky View Motel, room 114, and I have an emergency.
I need police and EMS immediately.
excuse me...
Hey, man, you all right? What's going on out here?
I don't know exactly. He just flipped out.
Nick, I honestly think he would have killed me.
Hodges? - Yeah, but it wasn't Hodges.
I mean, if you would've seen the look in his eyes, something must have happened to him in there, something to trigger this.
What'd he say to you? - Nothing.
everything that came out of him was unintelligible.
it was grunts and growls.
Hey, so paramedics hit him with a sedative.
once they get him to the hospital, maybe we'll figure out what's going on.
wait, wait, before he goes, I-I need a-a... a swab.
check your vest.
hold up.
Hey, buddy, I just need to get some saliva. Can you help me out?
can you open up? Come on, just open up.
there you go, help me out. There you go. Good.
Yeah, get him out of here.
vitals are good...
Thanks, Doc. I appreciate it. - You're welcome.
what did he say? How's he doing?
he's gonna be okay. I mean, his vitals are all in the normal range.
he doesn't seem to be in any physical distress.
well, obviously there is something going on in that motel room.
now we need to add Hodges to the list of people that went nuts in there, right?
homeless guy, the teacher
makes me wonder about our first victim, Mark Bell.
who's to say he didn't go crazy, too, and stab himself in his legs.
if all of this is true, what's it say about the man who lost his wife?
Hey, guys, you are not gonna believe this one. Hodges was drugged.
what are you talking about? - LSD-I did an ELISA test on his saliva.
somehow, he must've been dosed while we were in the room working.
wait a minute, didn't the hospital do a tox screen on the teacher and on Rudy, and it came back negative?
the standard tox panel doesn't test for LSD, so they were probably dosed, too-- we just had no way to know it.
but wh-why the violence?
the molecules I found were highly adulterated, and cut with a cyclidine similar to PCP.
probably came out of somebody's kitchen sink.
okay. Now we know what.
let's go find out how.
so, according to Henry, this lysergic acid glows blue.
and the stuff's potent. We may not be looking for much.
wait a minute-- got something over here.
these are tiny drops.
it looks like they might've been aerosolized.
check it out-- covered in blue.
this is our source right here.
if Hodges got sprayed by that, it would only have to land on his lips or in his eye, and it would be instantly absorbed.
here, let me bag it.
hold on here.
I don't think the LSD was coming from that cartridge.
there's a hose in here.
Yeah, and it's coming through the wall from the next room.
Hey, Oscar, can we use your bathroom for a second?
Hey! You can't come in here like this!
sure we can. Check it out, Greg.
it's called probable cause, Oscar.
what do you got?
found the source.
Oscar, I remember standing right there and listening to you preach to me about God's will.
is this what you meant? Huh? Killing six people?
I didn't kill anyone.
you've been spraying LSD all over the bathroom next door. You're responsible!
I don't know what you're talking about. God sees the truth.
Yes, sir! - God knows my heart!
you know what? I'm tired of hearing that.
sit down, relax. I'm gonna get you a ride.
Nick, take a look at this.
that's an odd place for a TV.
that's the room next door-- room 114.
so not only have you been dosing the people next door, you've been recording it, too?
Hey, Nick, I don't see any recording device.
but there's this transmitter set up to send a signal someplace else.
so what's with all the video stuff?
I don't know. I just know I'm not supposed to touch it.
yeah? Who told you that? Huh?
Trent, the manager.
he said if I did, he'd kick me out.
Trent Raeger, got a warrant. See you downtown.
Hey, Nick, you gotta come and see this.
our peeper has been looking at all the rooms, not just room 114.
Yeah, he's been spending some quality time in here.
these are all souvenirs... from his favorite guests.
you've been peeping on room 114 for a long time, haven't you, Trent?
at what point did you decide that it wasn't enough to just be a voyeur?
I mean, when did you decide that you needed to kill people?
it isn't like that.
okay, then tell me what it's like.
well, it's just about... watching, you know?
all the people coming through the motel.
when I was a kid, we'd get a family on vacation, and I was curious because we never took vacations.
we never left.
so...
I had these special places where I could look through the walls... watch them.
special places.
then the video age came and you upgraded your little hobby, right?
that was pretty cool, too.
I mean, especially when the motel kind of went downhill, you know?
that brought all kinds of crazy stuff.
the crack whores, drunk dudes, beating their wives, they...
that is a show, believe me.
but even that ligole old and dull, so you spiced it up by dosing people with drugs?
a few months ago, I saw this guy out on Third, tripping on acid.
he was, like, out of his mind, and it was just so... so weird.
and that is when I came up with that rig for the bathroom.
you have to admit... it is pretty clever.
clever.
five people are dead, one is in the hospital.
Hey, I just put the gas in the car... okay?
they're the ones that crashed it.
come on...
you've got my tapes; you've seen 'em.
that first dude, hacking his legs off.
or that teacher... oh, and the homeless guy.
I mean, the dude is already a total mess, and then the lady has all those dolls!
I mean, that was a gift.
or the poor Mexican guy... killing his wife.
honestly, I didn't see that coming.
I mean, that... that...
...that was awesome.
awesome.
what are you looking at me like that for?
come on, people go online every day to look at stuff that's just like that.
but you manipulated this. You made this happen.
you made these people, these innocent people, do these things.
so what? What's the difference?
well, you'll have 25 years to life to figure that out.
and the weird thing is you're gonna be in a little room with people watching you 24/7.
I, uh, heard they're going to be discharging you soon.
I guess I've healed as much as I'm going to.
well, I... I came 'cause I wanted you to know that we arrested the man responsible for what happened to you and to your wife.
he didn't physically do the killings, but he is responsible.
well, I-I... I'm sorry, I'm a little confused here.
the man we arrested... lived in the motel, and he drugged several of his guests.
that night, when your wife went to sleep, you went into the bathroom and you snuck a cigarette.
while you were in the bathroom, you were dosed with a very potent psychedelic drug, and it caused a violent change in your personality and your behavior.
that face... that you saw...
the man who was hitting your wife...
in a little while, there's going to be some police officers coming here, and you're going to need to go with them, okay?
I'm sorry.
I want to apologize for anything I may have said while I wasn't myself.
it wasn't your words so much as your actions, really.
and, obviously... I apologize for those, too.
apology accepted?
Yes. Apology accepted.
good. Then you won't be trying to get back at me in some way?
no, of course not.
but I wouldn't drink that coffee, if I were you.
Where's Russell? - He's in layout.
what's going on?
it's Sara. There's been a shooting.
how bad is it?
I-I don't know. Her cell phone cut out.
what about Finn?
I can't reach her either.
listen to me, I want you to call the Sheriff's Office in Larkston.
find out if they know anything about the shooting.
go.
Jim, it's DB. I need a chopper.
deputy's dead.
sheriff's still alive.
Sara. It's been a rough 48 hours. You all right?
I'm okay. Bullet just grazed me.
what about Finn-- do you know where she is?
no, I don't know. She's not picking up her cell.
what if he went after her?
well... we gotta find her.
come on! Stop!
paramedics said you're good to go.
so, Brass is gonna take your statement down in the Sheriff's Office in Larkston.
Yeah, yeah, I'll go over there as soon as we find Finn.
no, no, listen to me, please.
there are gonna be a lot of questions about what happened the last couple of days.
Sara, I need you to talk to Brass now-- please.
Nick and I are gonna stay here until we find Finn, I promise you that. All right?
I'm so glad you're okay.
thank you.
uh, who's in charge here, please?
I... I-I guess that would be me. Uh, Maxine Lennox.
deputy Lennox, I'm CSI Supervisor Russell.
one of my CSIs is missing.
she was investigating a case up here. Her name's Julie Finlay.
Yes. I saw her a few hours ago at the motel. Lent her my car.
she said she was following up on a lead.
did she say where she was going? - No.
I need you to put a broadcast out on your car, right now.
Yes, sir.
I got you this; I thought you could use it.
thank you.
how you holding up?
it's been a long couple of days.
well, uh, I know things might be a little cloudy for you right now, but, uh...
you know, we have to officially get a statement to know what happened up here.
I know the drill.
let's start from the beginning.
what were you and CSIs Finlay and Brody doing here in Larkston?
Larkston was never part of the plan.
we just wanted to have a little fun, I mean...how often do we all have the weekend off?
48 hours earlier
I am gonna go home, open a bottle of wine and watch Hepburn and Tracy movies.
Oh, wish I could do that.
I've got about a month's worth of laundry to do.
what are you up to, Morgan?
uh, actually, I am driving to Reno.
my mom got me this gift certificate for a spa there.
it has all mineral-based treatments, so I am getting the amethyst massage.
it's supposed to calm the nerves and absorb negative energy.
I could probably use that.
Yeah, me, too.
you guys should join me.
I got a suite. Got plenty of room.
Oh, I...I mean, we don't want to crash your weekend.
are you kidding? I would love it.
I hate drinking alone.
massages, alcohol...? I'm in.
I'm in.
awesome! Okay...um, let's go home, change, and I'll meet you back here in an hour.
but you never made it to Reno. Why not?
Finn said that if we took her car, we could make it there in half the time.
that turned out to be a mistake.
Yeah, she's a beauty. You got the 440 in there?
Yeah. And the four barrel carb.
that's a lot of power.
Oh, I think I can handle it.
so, Darryl, uh, what's the bottom line? Can you fix it?
uh, yeah, it's just a broken water pump. I can replace it in about an hour.
now, if, uh...I order the part tonight, I should have it by noon tomorrow.
so much for our moonlit salt scrubs.
I can give you ladies a lift into Larkston.
we don't have a spa, but we do have a nice motel.
plus it's karaoke night at the Cactus.
awesome.
come on. Have a drink, some food, it'll be fun.
try not to look so happy, you guys.
Oh, my gosh, couple shots of tequila and you turn into Janis Joplin.
Yeah, I think you missed your calling. Like, awesome!
Thanks. Yeah, uh, well, I was a double major in college.
chemistry and voice. Chose chemistry.
but I was the front woman for a band at The Roxy for a year.
I can't believe we didn't know this about you.
speaking of secrets, I didn't know you were into mechanics.
Yeah, you and, um, Darryl...seem to be enjoying each other's company tonight.
he's very nice. He's, uh, he's actually smart.
he's, uh, he's funny. Knows a lot about cars.
it's too bad he's so unattractive.
this round's on Darryl.
thank you.
thank you.
all right, here's to our girls' weekend.
all right, so I'm gonna, um, go back to the motel.
I'll come with you.
stay, have fun.
Darryl's gonna walk me home.
we need to finish the conversation.
of course you do.
see you guys later.
okay. Have fun.
the stars are really beautiful out here.
there's so many lights in Vegas, you know, you never get to see them.
Yeah, I guess I don't really notice them anymore.
born and raised here. I guess I kind of take them for granted.
was it great growing up here? - Yeah, it was great.
was it? - It was real great.
must have been.
you have something in your pocket.
you mean, um...You mean this.
you got me.
I'm not really into married men. Or liars.
I'm not lying anymore.
you're still married.
not happily.
good night.
night?
you're a little tease, you know that?
Darryl, don't do this.
Oh, you're not going anywhere. You think you can just lead me on all night and then just walk away?
don't do this.
I don't want to hurt you. But I will.
you're dead.
what happened?
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
I stabbed him.
what are you talking about?
he attacked me. - What?
I think he's dead.
Darlene, call the sheriff.
Finn, what happened?
I don't know.
okay, we got to get you to a hospital-- you need stitches.
I don't want to go to the hospital.
Where's Darryl?
He's- he's over here.
show us.
his body was right here.
Where'd it go?
how many times did you stab him?
I stabbed him twice.
what did you do with the knife?
uh, I-I-I dropped it beside the body.
maybe you didn't kill him, Finn. Maybe he's not dead.
did you take his pulse?
no, no, I wanted to get away. I-I'm sure he was not moving.
it's okay. All right? It's gonna be all right.
they're not flags, but they'll have to do.
really hard to tell how much blood he lost. It seeped into the dirt.
there are blood drops moving away from the blood pool.
Hey, Finn, was Darryl wearing cowboy boots?
Yeah.
I got a boot print and corresponding blood drops.
he was on his feet and bleeding.
Ah, I didn't kill him. He walked away.
there's a second set of prints, so...not by himself. Somebody helped him.
into a car.
blood drops end...where these tire tracks begin.
what the hell you girls think you're doing?
it's all right.
sheriff, we're law enforcement-- Las Vegas CSIs Sidle, Finlay and Brody.
Las Vegas Crime Lab?!
I didn't call you to work this scene.
uh, we're not working the scene. Our friend here was attacked.
I got a phone call saying you killed him.
well, the evidence shows that Darryl is still alive.
evidence? Thought you said you weren't working the scene.
we're not working the scene. We just made a couple of observations.
Yeah, I'm making a few of those myself.
three girls; been drinking...one bleeding...messing around in a crime scene you got no business being in.
we're not messing around.
how do I know you didn't kill him?
dumped his body somewhere.
now you're tampering with the evidence.
so he just released you?
no. No. His deputies separated Morgan and I, and, uh, they interrogated us inside the bar.
what about Finn?
sheriff put her under house arrest in the motel.
Finn said that he grilled her while the local doctor stitched her up.
so you're saying the knife...was Darryl's? - Yes.
how'd it end up in your hands?
I told you: He pulled the knife, he tried to rape me, I grabbed the knife and I fought back.
look at these bruises, Sheriff. Consistent with a struggle.
so you stabbed him in self-defense and in that few minutes, while you were inside the bar telling your friends, someone took Darryl and the knife.
Yes. And he is out there, and I-I think you should be out there looking for him.
Oh, I got deputies going to his house and his auto shop.
but, frankly...you could save us all a lot of time.
just tell us the truth.
I am telling you the truth.
I am a CSI, and I deserve the benefit of the doubt.
I've known Darryl Walsh for 15 years.
I play poker with him every other Thursday.
it just doesn't seem like something he'd do.
ms. Finlay didn't inflict these wounds herself.
come on, Owen, she's been through enough.
do you really have to keep her locked up here like a prisoner?
until I figure out what happened to Darryl...she's not going anywhere.
you do your job, Marty; I'll do mine.
all done. You're gonna be just fine.
any sign of Finn?
no.
Russell just texted. They're still following up on leads.
so, CSI Brody took photographs of the crime scene which you believe prove that Darryl Walsh was still alive.
now, did you share those photos with the deputies who questioned you?
Yes. Of course. I mean, it wasn't our scene.
we were legally obligated to turn 'em over.
but Morgan didn't delete them from her cell phone, did she?
that, uh, tire track photo that you guys sent me from the crime scene, I ran it through tread find-- tire was manufactured by Bridgman Wheels in 2008.
what kind of car? - A truck, actually.
primarily the Ford Ranger and F-150.
I pulled DMV records.
sending you a list of everyone in Larkston who owns that vehicle.
pulling it up now. Thank you.
Hey, Sheriff? - Yeah.
according to DMV records, there's over 30 vehicles in this town with tires that match the tracks that we found at the crime scene.
well, the last I checked, you weren't part of this investigation.
sheriff, evidence shows that somebody helped Darryl Walsh into a truck.
we find the truck, maybe we find Darryl.
it exonerates CSI Finlay.
you really think he's still alive?
there were no drag marks.
boot prints and blood drops show that he was upright and moving when he got into the truck.
you've searched his home, you've searched his work. You haven't found him.
this list is the closest thing we have to a lead.
all we're asking is that you take a look at it.
is there anyone on here that might put themselves on the line for Darryl?
all right.
Valerie Irvin, Darryl's wife.
great. Let's go talk to her.
we can't. She left for Vegas this morning.
I'll call Greg right away. Have him bring her in for questioning.
you don't seem too worried about your husband, Mrs. Irvin.
I mean, Darryl was stabbed. Now he's missing.
and you're playing slots in Vegas.
Oh, he'll turn up. He always does.
so he's gone missing before?
we don't really keep tabs on each other.
Darryl does his thing, I do mine.
uh, last night, after Darryl was stabbed, back in Larkston, somebody picked him up from the motel.
wasn't me.
I was working all night at the diner, 6:00 to 6:00.
I drove straight here after my shift.
uh, we searched your truck.
found this...stuck to the floor mat.
what is that?
it was a high resin leaf, along with expanded clay pebbles.
marijuana.
I get it-- so Darryl was running a hydroponic pot-growing operation under the radar.
thing about hydroponics-- it requires a lot of energy.
I pulled up the electrical grid of the town of Larkston.
the blue dots represent average household electrical use per month, about 900 kilowatts.
well, they're all blue dots.
a grow house would use at least five times that much power.
now, step back in time with me as we follow the "current" back to the past.
this is a time lapse reversal of the town's electrical use over the past year.
there's your red dot-- indicates usage of over 5, 000 kilowatts a month for four months.
goes back to normal for a month and then spikes again for another four months.
typical growth and harvest cycle for marijuana.
four months to grow, one month to dry.
and only minutes to enjoy it.
so I've heard.
so what is that, a house?
well, according to the satellite image, it's a dilapidated barn, registered to Edith Skinner.
she's 85.
think old lady Skinner has any idea what Darryl and Val are doing in her barn?
I just talked to her.
Darryl told her he was storing some cars here.
put that thing away.
Darryl could be hiding in here somewhere. I'm not taking any chances.
Willis, pop the trunk.
he's not the monster you're making him out to be.
no offense, Sheriff, but I'm not sure you know Darryl the way you think you do.
plates are all from out of state.
well, Darryl could've bought 'em for spare parts.
or, in addition to growing pot, he's running a chop shop.
no sign of him.
sheriff, Deputy, take a look at this.
Oh, my God.
you still think your friend's not a monster?
all right. Let's do it.
blunt force trauma to the head and face.
compound fracture to the right forearm.
it looks like she was beaten to death.
when I have to put on my coroner's hat, death is usually natural causes or car accidents.
don't see violence like this very often.
wish we could say the same.
no identification.
there's a green residue on the shoes here.
didn't come from the car.
do you mind if I collect it?
not at all.
there's no fresh blood. There's no evidence that Darryl was here last night.
wife's alibi checked out.
Val wasn't the one that picked him up.
maybe one of his buddies gave him a ride, and he's hiding him somewhere.
Val said that she had no idea what Darryl was doing up here.
said that he borrows her truck all the time.
it could explain the pebbles and the cannabis.
I'll run the license and registration on these vehicles.
see if we can figure out who they belong to.
Thanks. Uh, Sheriff...
I would really like CSI Finlay to help us out on the case.
there's no reason to keep her locked up in that motel room.
she still stabbed Darryl.
in self defense.
but she had nothing to do with this crime scene, and frankly...we could really use her help.
fine.
I'll lift the house arrest, but she's not leaving town.
one more thing...
anyone ever tell you you're pushy?
I just need DNA samples from everyone here, for elimination purposes.
what, you think one of us had something to do with this?
just procedure.
then what happened?
morgan took those samples back to the lab.
what about the body-- did Dr. Kinney do the autopsy?
no. No. Because of his limited experience in forensic pathology.
morgan took the body back to Vegas as well.
she handed it off to David Phillips.
so, let me get this straight.
Finn, Morgan and Sara go away for a nice fun weekend.
Finn is then attacked, accused of murder and Sara finds a body?
Yeah. Not the relaxing weekend they were hoping for.
Hey, David, there's a 419 at the Mediterranean.
I'm on it.
pumpkins painted on her nails. Must've liked Halloween.
that could be when she went missing.
I'll rehydrate her fingertip, see if we can get an I. D.
based on the temperature of the building and the condition of the body,
I'd say she's been dead less than a month.
these look like ligature marks. Narrow.
killer could've used a string to tie her up. Maybe wire.
restrained and beaten.
circular size and shape tell me she was hit repeatedly with a hammer.
any idea how old she was?
wisdom teeth are present, so she's over 18.
and there's something in her teeth.
could you hold that?
looks like a pubic hair.
suggests sexual activity close to the time of death.
considering that she was restrained, I'm betting the sex wasn't consensual.
I'll collect an SAE kit.
follicle is still attached. Should be able to get DNA.
might help us identify her killer.
what did you find out?
victim's name is Brenda Whittaker.
she is a 23-year-old from San Diego.
disappeared four months ago.
cross-referenced her driver's license and registration and prints confirmed it was her.
held against her will and raped.
spermatozoa was found in the oral, anal and vaginal samples collected from the victim.
still waiting on the DNA.
which will prove Darryl's a murderer.
can't believe he's still out there.
which is why you better watch your back.
tell me about the other cars in the barn.
they belong to two other missing women.
a 19-year-old college student from Sedona and a 28-year-old waitress from Salt Lake City - both missing for over a year and both traveling alone.
Darryl's a mechanic, right?
Yeah, he operates a gas station and a garage.
so maybe these women had car trouble, stopped for gas.
just happened to be Darryl's type.
he seduced them, abducted them, raped them, and probably killed them.
Brenda Whittaker was the only one found.
Darryl must've dumped the other bodies someplace else.
this is Hodges. I have to go.
Oh, go ahead.
what have you got?
trace Morgan collected from the victim's shoes-- Pediastrum boryanum.
algae?
specifically green algae found in fresh water.
I did some checking, and the nearest large body of fresh water is over 150 miles away.
that doesn't make any sense.
Finn was here when we spoke on the phone last night, so this is the last place she was seen.
and that was...a few hours ago.
well, we know she borrowed the deputy's car.
where was she going?
she shouldn't have been going anywhere.
her laptop's locked. Any idea what the password might be?
Um...bloodgirl.
Nope.
Bloodgirl528?
no, sir.
Oh, I know, I know-- uh... Try "Agnes."
Agnes? Who's that?
crazy aunt she loved.
worked.
all right. So, according to her Web history, she was looking for fresh bodies of water in the area.
did she find any?
no, not according to this.
she wrote the name "Gary" next to an ad for the Diamond Cactus Bar & Grill.
that's the bar they were at Friday night.
give them a little call here.
uh, hey, there. Um...is Gary around?
he's on his break?
okay. Thank you.
he's the bartender.
if I was looking for information around town, that'd be the first place I'd start.
Yeah, let's go talk to him.
did CSI Finlay ask you anything about bodies of water?
Yeah. She wanted to know if there were any lakes or streams nearby that weren't on a map.
only thing I could think of was Stone Rock Lake.
is that a man-made lake?
just a hole in the ground now. It dried up years ago.
you know, the algae would still be there.
how far away is this place?
about 30 miles from here in the old Stone Rock Lake campground.
just off Stevenson Highway.
Thanks, Gary.
what do you think? I'd hate to go running off in the wrong direction.
well, I think that an abandoned campground would be a great place for Darryl to hold women hostage.
be a good place for him to hide out, too.
Finn's got a two-hour head start on us.
let's go find her before she finds him.
so how'd you end up in a nasty gunfight?
deputy Willis said that he got a tip that Darryl's car had been spotted on the side of the road, just off the interstate.
so...I went with the sheriff to check it out.
Darryl! It's Owen!
get out of the vehicle!
we're armed, Darryl!
come on, show us your hands!
he's not here.
is that bus stop still active?
Yes, it is.
where does it go?
Reno.
but from there, he could've hopped a plane. He could be anywhere by now.
get on the radio and find out when the last bus came through here.
Hey, Henry, what's up?
are you sure?
okay. Thanks.
what the hell are you doing?
drop your weapons.
sheriff, step away from Deputy Willis.
sheriff...
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what the hell's going on.
got DNA results on semen recovered from the woman's body in the barn.
there were two male contributors.
you telling me there was two men involved in that woman's death?
Darryl Walsh and Deputy Simon Willis.
what? That's crazy.
ms. Sidle, there's got to be some kind of mistake.
my colleague compared the samples of the DNA that I got off of you and your deputies at the crime scene.
no mistake.
Simon...did you have anything to do with that woman's death?
no. Owen, come on, you know me.
why don't you...why don't you put the gun down, we'll talk about it.
okay.
you're lucky it was just a graze.
Yeah.
I managed to get a call through to Morgan and...shortly after that, help arrived.
you know, you saved Sheriff Gardner's life. I got a message that he's out of surgery.
his version of the facts matches yours.
so, we're done?
I'll just file a report with the IAB, they'll make their determination, but I wouldn't sweat it.
thank you for coming.
you're welcome.
Oh, hey, Sara? - Yeah?
let me know when you hear about Finn.
I will.
plate's a match.
match Deputy Lennox's car, so Finn's got to be around here.
the keys are in it.
she must've had car trouble.
coil wires have been cut.
Darryl wanted to make sure she couldn't leave.
Nick...I got blood in the car.
okay. Let's go.
take the right.
I got a body over here, man.
it's Darryl Walsh. Shot in the chest.
he's dead as a doornail.
all right, so...
Finn's not dead, then where the hell is she?
obviously, this is where...he kept the girls.
so what do we got here?
got a fully loaded rape kit.
three shells.
380 casing-- same as Finn.
it's her cell phone.
all right, let-let's figure this out.
well, for starters, we got an ax handle with blood all over it.
rape kit's open.
her cell phone's right next to it, so maybe she was trying to document the crime scene, right?
Yeah, he disables her car, he grabs the handle on his way back inside, and just...ambushes her.
and that would have pissed her off.
Yeah, yeah. She fought back, for sure.
and there's two bullets in the wall right here.
so she gets off three shots-- two miss, but that third one, boy...
punched a hole in his chest.
blood pool is still liquid around the edges, so...this couldn't have happened too long ago.
car's dead; she's got to be on foot.
after she makes it through this mess, she probably made a beeline for the road.
I need you to stay here and process this scene.
Finn shot the guy. We need to do this right.
I'll go look for her.
okay.
we're looking for Julie Finlay. She's right around the corner.
Russell...how is she?
they were able to stop the bleeding.
she has a ruptured spleen, two broken ribs, and a concussion.
she's gonna be okay, though.
thank God.
the doctors say that her injuries are consistent with being hit by a car.
I was out on that road.
I didn't see any skid marks.
this was intentional.
Darryl Walsh and Deputy Willis are both dead. Who else could be behind this?
that's what we're gonna find out.
why don't you go ahead and process her and her clothes.
see what we can find.
so, these bruise lines were made by the grill of the car.
so, this circle, is that some sort of logo?
I don't know. Let me see if I can enhance it.
what kind of car is that?
that's not a car. That's a badge of honor.
I-I saw this guy on one of those antique car shows. He had this old car, he drove it for years, and when he hit a million miles, he got an emblem to put on the grill of his car.
"million Mile Club." MMC.
it's very exclusive.
and the town of Larkston has one member.
Hey, Doc.
mind if I join you?
Wh-what's this about?
well, I saw your car parked out front.
looks like it's...been in an accident.
now, that'd be a real shame-- you've been driving that car for a long time.
you got over a million miles on it.
you even have that cool grill badge to prove it.
love that thing.
it also made quite an impression on my friend...when you hit her with your car.
it was an accident.
no, it wasn't.
you tried to kill CSI Finlay to protect your nasty secret.
what nasty secret?
that you're a part of Deputy Willis and Darryl Walsh's little rape club.
that's not true.
I found evidence you were in the cabin in Stone Rock Lake.
I was only there to stitch up Darryl after CSI Finlay stabbed him.
deputy Willis forced me.
did he also force you to rape Brenda Whittaker?
come on. I'm a CSI, man, and a pretty good one.
you don't think I'm gonna find your dirty, nasty used condoms in the trash can out front?
DNA was all over them.
so, I had sex with her.
no. You raped her.
and tying a woman up against her will, for months, and raping her over and over and over again, and then, you bash her head in with a hammer, and you dump her body in the hood of her car.
I don't think I need to tell you what that is.
I had nothing to do with her death.
that was all Darryl and-and Deputy Willis.
well, they're gone.
you're the one left holding the bag now.
so, I know there are at least two other women missing. Where are their bodies?
I don't know. I...
Darryl said they took care of them.
all I did was have sex with those girls.
I-I never did anything to hurt them.
what do you think rape is?
you're a sick man, Dr. Kinney.
you need some help.
and now you're under arrest.
you heard the man.
come on, let's go.
how you doing? You all right?
want some more drugs?
I do like the ones I'm on.
thought we almost lost you there for a minute, Jules.
I already started interviewing replacements.
yeah? You think you can get rid of me that easily?
we could always hope.
up for more visitors?
I'll call you tomorrow.
okay.
so, we never made it to the spa. Thought we'd bring it to you.
thank you.
so what do you want to do next weekend?
once upon a time, there was a reindeer named Winston.
winston was lost.
he wandered the city instead of delivering toys in the frost.
winston searched every roof and chimney.
where, oh, where could jolly Santa be?
thank you.
happy holidays.
not for Santa, I hear.
there's gonna be a lot of disappointed kids this year.
snow in Vegas.
well, this White Christmas is brought to you courtesy of the Winter Wonderland Company -
the employee Jayson Walt, he's over there.
reindeer wrangler, snowmaker, jack-of-all-trades.
he comes to work this morning, finds a dead Santa and a missing reindeer.
they went all out.
patrol found Dasher about an hour ago on the Strip, blood in his fur.
animal Control brought him here, and Jayson Walt identified him as Dasher.
david Phillips has the I. D. on the dead guy.
good luck.
David, got a name yet?
lucky for us the victim is not a Secret Santa.
he's got business cards, everything.
Brad Fante-- your friendly neighborhood I. T. guy.
works for Bonham Realty.
must have been the company Kringle.
liver temp tells me he died between 12: 00 and 1: 00 a. m.
and both femoral arteries were severed.
so he bled out.
what are those, bloody hoofprints?
looks like it.
so the reindeer sees Santa here die violently, breaks out of the pen, tracks through the fresh blood.
and I thought Rudolph had it bad.
there's blood on the runner here.
he was definitely run over by the sleigh.
I got a lot of blood at his back.
could you help me flip him?
five sharp-force injuries.
that's a lot of blood, so he was still alive when he was stabbed.
this is not an accident.
grandma may have gotten run over by a reindeer, but Santa got "sleighed."
it's already 50 degrees, the sun's still rising.
it's supposed to get up to 70 today. Say good-bye to the snow.
our main priority is to record and preserve-- analyze everything when we get back to the lab.
are we good for shoe impressions?
good?
to collect them from the snow.
I'm guessing you didn't process many cold scenes in L. A.
try none.
all right, well, heat is usually the battle here in Vegas, but today it's snow.
blood doesn't read the same way, the drops blend in, no spines, and prints don't lift easily.
Yeah, makes sense.
so we are going to need liquid cold wax to process any impressions, and dry ice, too.
all right. I'll call Hodges and have him bring it on over.
I'm Ryan Bonham.
sorry I kept you waiting. I had to check on my son Blake.
I, uh, just can't believe all this.
no. It's a hell of a thing.
sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you a few questions here.
how well did you know the victim, Mr. Fante?
I didn't know him that well-- I mean, he'd been with my company for a few months.
he was all psyched to organize the Christmas party.
get along with the other employees?
Oh, yeah.
Brad worked miracles with computers. Everyone loved him.
he made a perfect Santa.
is there anything you can tell me about last night?
not really, no. I mean, you know, the company had a great year, everybody was partying, they were happy.
and then around 9: 00, I went upstairs to put Blake to bed.
he's six now.
Christmas is a bit of a tough time for him. For me, too.
my, uh...my wife died...two years ago, Christmas Eve.
sorry to hear that.
uh, anyway, like I said, I stayed with him, I fell asleep, the sirens woke me up, and I looked out my window...
Yeah, I thought I'd seen my share of Christmas tragedy in my life, but...
I guess not.
you had a long night, huh, Dash?
bet you're hungry, huh?
that's all right, we're gonna get you some grub.
Mr. Walt?
Yeah, that's me.
I'm, uh, CSI Sanders. I'm here to...process your reindeer.
process? You don't mean put him down?
no, I...just need to collect a sample of blood from his fur.
Why?
well, he walked through a crime scene, and the blood could be from our victim or even from our killer.
okay.
it's okay, boy. It's just a little cotton on a stick.
good.
do you always leave your reindeer out at night?
Oh, yeah, yeah, they like it.
Yeah, what with the snow? Reminds them of Iceland.
only place in the world you can find real reindeer.
Yeah, they sleep by the glaciers.
Hey, you think Dasher saw who did it?
um... it's... certainly possible.
you know, I saw this thing on the news.
they're giving MRI's to dogs now.
their brains are a lot like ours.
so old Dasher here, he can't tell us what he saw, but, you know, maybe someday we'll know what he's thinking.
all right, well, uh...I think I got what I need.
Thanks.
good boy. That was good.
you got something?
Yeah, partial boot impression.
I checked it against Santa's-- it's not his.
blood drop inside.
got blood drops over here as well.
man, Greg was right.
you can't tell directionality.
but they are close to where the body was. Could be gravitational.
suggests... this is the area where it all happened.
Santa gets stabbed in the back, grabs at his wounds, trying to stop the bleeding, but the blood is flowing.
bumps into the sled, dislodges it.
and the elf kingdom weeps.
time for our trusty ice wax.
I had to use this in the infamous Mount Charleston Chalet Murder.
death by ski pole. Long story.
so, how does it work exactly?
the wax preserves the impression, insulating the snow, preventing any loss of detail caused by heat from the exothermic reaction of the casting material.
nice.
um, what about the blood drops?
you can take them to go.
all right.
why do you think Santa was hanging out here all by his lonesome after the party?
he was probably recovering from the forced levity of a hyper-commercialized holiday that's lost all sense of wonder.
somebody got a lot of coal in his stocking as a kid.
I wish.
instead of regaling me with stories of Santa, my scientist father lectured me on the implausibility of the whole thing.
what, he didn't think a fat man in a sled could make it around the world in one night?
he also had a problem with the climate damage caused by toy factories in the North Pole.
God, I hope I don't have you as my Secret Santa.
I can't believe we're actually doing it again this year.
must be Bonham's kid.
I wonder if he saw anything.
I don't think anybody's talked to him yet.
maybe we should take a shot at it.
aren't vaguely Dickensian suburban kids Russell's department?
season's greetings, Doctor.
how's it going in here?
well, our friend here, Mr. Fante, is definitely on someone's naughty list.
looks like you got Secret Santa. You gonna open it?
why don't you do the honors for me, Nick.
all right.
herbal tea.
I think you got Russell.
I think our victim got more than a stab in the back.
he's got a cut on the cheek, and bruising.
well, maybe he was punched before he was knifed.
fiber in the wound.
you know, that almost looks synthetic.
killer could have been wearing gloves.
the stabbing was particularly vicious.
the killer twisted the blade.
well, that's the personal touch right there.
okay. Christmas party, bunch of booze flowing.
two guys just got in a fight.
I know we got to wait on tox, but...did you find any alcohol in his stomach?
Nope, just milk and cookies.
Mr. Claus was a teetotaler.
okay, there goes the drunken-brawl theory.
but one thing is for sure. Jolly St. Nick here must have pissed somebody off.
"Winston looked east, and he looked west.
he saw a light in the distance, maybe a place to rest."
then Mommy got a call from Daddy, and she had to put the book down.
phone.
is that your mom?
she didn't get to the end of the story.
Yeah.
the Lost Reindeer.
you must watch that a lot.
did you watch it with your daddy last night?
Yeah. He fell asleep. He was tired.
well, after your dad went to sleep, did you happen to see or hear anything outside?
I saw the Christmas tree lights go off downtown.
well, you know, you got to stay up pretty late.
do you think maybe you happened to see anything else?
I saw a reindeer.
I did, too, right outside there. It's pretty awesome, right?
not that reindeer. The one in the house.
you saw a reindeer in the house?
on the staircase.
it had its head down, pawing at the floor, so I got scared and shut my door.
I think, young man, what you were experiencing was a dream, REM sleep.
during REM sleep, a pretty awesome brain chemical called acetylcholine becomes active, subduing other neurotransmitters.
now, this excess acetylcholine is what makes you dream.
so, nothing you saw was real.
is Santa real?
Yes. Yes.
Santa is very real.
so, what is the snow report?
uh, DNA from the blood drops in the snow are all a match to our victim, Brad Fante.
and as far as that partial boot print goes, it's from a Timberland, size unknown.
we got a list of all of the shoes worn by the 22 guests who were in attendance at the party.
no match to any of them.
nor the home owner, Ryan. Nor our reindeer wrangler.
so, I guess snow's a white-out.
snow far.
I've been letting it melt so I could strain the water for more trace.
I don't think I'll need a strainer for that.
must have been buried underneath the snow.
that looks biological.
maybe part of the victim's intestine?
possibly.
I'll run it and find out.
it's a good look for you.
the antlers are all business, my friend.
fiber found in our victim, Brad Fante's, cheek wound.
made from specific modacrylic polymers and dye.
used in fake fur and... this.
reindeer costume.
purchased at a local costume store, complete with furry hoof gloves.
now, I'm thinking that some time before he got knifed, our Santa took a left hoof at the party from a pantomime reindeer.
you're kidding me?
if the reindeer glove fits, you need not acquit.
could also explain what little Blake Bonham saw at the bottom of the stairs.
and maybe our party animal left something behind.
Hodges' theory that it was someone in a reindeer costume at Ryan Bonham's party was correct, except for one detail.
it was a woman.
looking for her contact lens.
I found it on the staircase, traced the I. D. number.
Rachel Walker, 23. No record.
this woman worked at Bonham Realty?
no. Actually, she worked at another fine Vegas establishment-- the Cathedral Strip Club.
featured dancer.
miss Reindeer. Well, that's quite an honor.
according to her bio, she beat out seven other strippers for the rack.
antlers. Crown.
I got it.
you know, I didn't get the sense that Ryan Bonham's Christmas party was that kind of party, so, why did he have Miss Reindeer at his house?
well, apparently, Mr. Bonham didn't know anything about it.
I spoke to the strip club.
it was Brad Fante who hired the girl and asked her to come late at night after all the children were nestled snug in their beds.
so, what are you thinking? That after the dancing stopped, Santa got a little out of hand?
Yeah, and Miss Reindeer here decided she didn't want to play anymore of his reindeer games.
I get it, but, enough, all right? Let's get to the good part.
you asked what happened. I'm telling you.
I was doing my number, doing my thing for Fante and his buddy.
I was okay with the home movies.
I was not okay with the free porno.
what do you think you're doing?
come on, vixen.
Santa screwing one of his reindeer? It'll be the greatest sex tape of all time!
are you getting this, Fred?!
No! No!
get off of me!
Yeah, but a reindeer punching Santa? That's just wrong.
he had it coming.
I'm no saint, but I'm not a whore.
but you could be a killer.
look, Rachel, I get it, I get it. You're both professional pole dancers.
you work the stripper pole, he works the North Pole.
so, he paid for a lap dance, and then he wanted to take you to the North Pole, show you the workshop for free.
and he wouldn't take "no" for an answer, so you got in a little tussle, you had to defend yourself
I get it.
I'm telling you, I didn't kill him.
guy wasn't worth it.
after I hit him, I went upstairs, I changed my clothes, and I got out of there.
Rachel, we have tape of you slugging Father Christmas!
I know.
Fred Larkin. He recorded the whole thing.
go ahead, talk to him.
he's the one that gave me a ride home, bought me breakfast at R. J's.
Fante was alive when we left.
so I go the security cam footage back from R. J.'s diner.
it confirms Rachel Walker and Fred Larkin's story.
doc said T. O. D. on Brad Fante was between midnight and 1: 00 a. m.
so, they definitely have alibis, according to the time stamp.
so, where does that leave us?
with no suspect and a lot of work to do.
Yeah.
new bracelet?
that is very observant of you.
well, it's why they pay me the big bucks.
come on. You're dying for me to say, "Thank you. That was so generous."
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
no, I don't.
okay, well, I'm your Secret Santa.
and I was planning on matching your generosity with something that I think you would really like.
well, I hate to break your heart, but I'm not your Secret Santa.
Really? - Really.
well, that's unfortunate.
very unfortunate for you.
I hate Christmas.
Finn said you found some mystery tissue in one of the snow samples I took from the scene.
not a mystery anymore.
is it from our victim?
no. In fact, it's not even human.
Sarda Chiliensis Lineolata. Otherwise known as Pacific Bonito.
Bonito? Well, they use it in sushi.
did they serve that at the party?
well, if so, it's not the only thing that they were serving.
I ran tox on the fish guts. Found traces of cocaine.
we know Brad Fante organized the office party.
he went off-script hiring Miss Reindeer.
who knows what else he had planned for the night.
we know he ordered bonito with a side of coke.
we know that he tried to stiff the stripper, in more ways than one.
well, if he was cheap with the stripper, maybe he stiffed his dealer, too.
then got stiffed.
this is Brad Fante's little helper, Fred Larkin.
not only did he film the stripper doing her reindeer dance, he also taped most of the party.
so, I've been going through it, hoping I'd see the killer getting into some kind of beef with Santa.
what did you find?
Oh, typical Christmas party stuff.
a quiet guy singing, unlikely couple hooking up, office joker crying in his beer.
anything unexpected?
Yeah. I found two Santas.
take a look at this.
here's the first thing I noticed.
Santa pounding a glass of wine.
it's a party. So what?
well, according to the doc, he didn't drink alcohol.
stomach contents were just milk and cookies.
so, take a look at this. This is 20 minutes later.
there's our wine-drinking Santa, and it looks like he gets a phone call.
now, it must have been pretty important, because I think that's when he ditched the party and lent his suit to Brad Fante, who, as we know, had his own plans for what to do with that.
and how do we know it's the same suit?
look right here.
the sleeve. See the stain?
45 minutes later.
same suit, different watches, different beverages different Santas.
well, it's easy for us to tell them apart, because we have this video, we have forensics, but...what if the killer couldn't?
well, we've run out of suspects with motives to kill the guy.
maybe Brad Fante was not the target.
no. No, the target...was this other Santa.
so, who is he?
at Winter Wonderland, we'll create a winter wonderland you'll never forget.
we're your first and last stop for all your holiday needs.
we'll even supply you with real snow, a live reindeer and all the trimmings.
including old St. Nick, himself-- ho, ho, ho!
so, come on down to Winter Wonderland.
and tell 'em Jayson sent you.
so, our reindeer wrangler neglected to tell us that "Santa" was part of the Winter Wonderland package.
according to Greg, he passed himself off as just an employee.
looks like he owns the company.
that still doesn't tell us why someone tried to kill him, though.
I might be able to help with that. - What do you got?
well, you know the cocaine-laced bonito we found in the snow at Ryan Bonham's yard?
well, it turns out that bonito wasn't served at the party.
so how'd it get there?
it was already in the ice.
how does that work?
well, I ran the truck manifest.
when it's not working holiday parties, it makes a lot of trips from Mexico to Vegas, transporting Pacific Bonito-- on ice.
bonito stuffed with cocaine.
which is how remnants of bonito and coke got mixed in with ice.
the same ice used to make the snow.
Jayson Walt thought he was providing a little snow for Christmas.
what he didn't realize is that he was adding a little powder to the powder.
well, that gives us motive for someone to try to kill him.
guy's a major drug runner. Could've been working with cartels in Mexico.
that's one Bad Santa.
that's one dead Santa, if we don't bring him in before the killer finds him.
thanks for coming in, Mr. Walt. I know it's a busy time of year for you.
LVPD interested in a White Christmas party?
no. I'm interested in a dead Santa that was found in Ryan Bonham's lawn.
now, up to 9: 33, you were the guy in the red suit playing Santa.
you didn't tell us that.
nobody asked.
look, pal, whoever killed the guy in the suit was after you.
no way. Why would anyone want to kill me?
I don't know, maybe 'cause you're running drugs from Mexico in your ice truck.
Yeah, we found fish guts laced with cocaine on Ryan Bonham's lawn.
okay, look. This is the part of the interview where you help us help you.
Oh, yeah. How's that?
well, in your line of business - and I'm not talking about spreading holiday cheer by putting fake snow on lawns -
I'm talking about the other kind of cheer with the other kind of snow.
now, obviously, you've made enemies.
you tell us who they are, we'll help you broker a deal with the DEA.
and what if I don't want to you help me?
well, then it's a quick trip upstate.
and the inmates up there have absolutely no goodwill toward men.
Yeah, I think I'll take my chances.
I'm trying to save your life.
Yeah, or maybe you're trying to work an angle.
wouldn't be the first party to have sushi and coke delivered.
Plus, I don't buy that you got evidence that I'm the delivery boy.
so, if we're through here, I'm late for my next Santa gig.
sit down, Kringle. Sit back down!
we have evidence.
we have your snow. We have your product.
someone's gonna read you your rights.
you're under arrest. Process him.
nail polish?
for your mistletoes.
cute. I like.
total chick gift.
I bet Finn's your Secret Santa.
maybe. Or maybe it's you, trying to cleverly trick me.
well, I guess we'll just have to wait for the office party, and all will be revealed.
in the meantime... Check this out, I just got Jayson Walt's phone records.
for the last week, he has been in touch with someone at Ely prison.
what, making reservations?
no. Texting and talking with his convict older brother, Gary Lee Walt.
what's Gary in for?
drug trafficking.
so maybe the little brother is holding the family business together while big brother's inside.
that's what I thought, until I looked at Gary Lee's trial transcript.
last year, Jayson Walt turned state's evidence and testified against his own brother.
well, he was probably just trying to save his own ass.
and his own piece of the drug trafficking pie.
so, why do you think they're talking now?
Gary Lee just won an appeal. He has a hearing scheduled.
how much you want to bet older brother's gonna try and convince younger brother to change his story?
Yeah. With a little cash incentive.
take a look at this last communication.
Jayson: Make it 200.
Gary Lee: Can't.
Jayson: No deal, bro.
brotherly love.
two days after this exchange, Brad Fante was knifed in the back, just after Jayson loaned him his Santa suit.
so, big brother tries to cut a Kringle. And misses.
I think it's time for us to make a trip to Ely.
well, we don't even have to go that far.
Gary Lee was just admitted to Desert Palm Hospital. Kidney failure.
Mr. Walt.
I'm CSI Stokes. With the LVPD.
I'm here to ask you a few questions about your brother, Jayson.
what about him?
well, it seems like somebody's trying to kill him.
it's not surprising.
my little brother has a way of pissing people off.
like you.
seems like you'd get pissed off pretty easily.
course, I wouldn't blame you, after what he did to you last year-- turning his back on you like that.
Jayson was just a scared little kid. Lied.
he's gonna come clean, now.
Really? I don't know, it doesn't seem like you two kiss and make up that easy.
what tells you that?
pictures.
I think your hitman made a mistake.
that's supposed to be your brother, isn't it?
I think you're the one who's making the mistake.
cause Jayson is the last person in the world I would want to kill.
because he's gonna deliver the greatest Christmas present ever.
he's gonna give me my life back.
in court and right here, in the hospital.
cause, you see, we've got perfect matching leukocyte antigens.
JAYSON'S gonna be your kidney donor.
real proud of my little bro.
he's stepping up. Family.
Yeah, family.
you know, I've read your texts.
I know you two were haggling over money, and I know you were paying him.
well...we all need a little incentive.
Yeah, but he wasn't happy with what you were offering.
and now, unfortunately for you, I don't think he's gonna be available.
sorry.
news flash.
Jayson and I arrived at a number.
and we came to an understanding.
including a little advance. For his bail.
his bail.
that's right. He's getting out just about now.
tomorrow he'll be in here saving my sorry ass.
week after that, he'll be recanting.
then I'm going to have the merriest Christmas Vegas has ever seen.
so the guy we thought had the best motive for killing Jayson Walt is actually the guy who has the least desire to see any harm come to him.
Yeah, without his brother's kidney, Gary Lee's a dead man.
what are you thinking? You got anything?
the autopsy.
it shows us that the killer stabbed the victim and then twisted that knife.
right. We thought it was personal.
okay, what if it was more than just personal?
I mean, given the fact that Gary Lee needs a kidney so desperately, what if their total destruction was the killer's intent?
you know what I mean?
you destroy Jayson Walt's kidneys, you're in effect killing Gary Lee Walt.
murder by proxy.
so, our question is who wants Gary Lee Walt dead?
I give you Gary Lee Walt's greatest hits.
allegedly. These are all drug related kills that he is suspected of ordering.
anyone of them could've ordered the hit.
Yeah, that's what I thought. Until I came to this crime scene.
Ryan Bonham's wife, Eva.
he told us that she died two years ago on Christmas Eve. This is how.
Eva Bonham worked at a Savings & Loan.
Yes. Gary Lee Walt was laundering his drug money at that bank.
an executive found out, was about to go to the police.
but Gary Lee Walt got to him first.
Eva Bonham was working late that night and became collateral damage.
leaving behind a husband to care for their little boy alone.
so, Ryan Bonham has been in touch with the DA all along.
he knew about the appeal.
he also knew that it had to be rescheduled because of Gary Lee Walt's surgery.
and he must have known that Jayson Walt was going to give his brother his kidney.
and he couldn't stand to see Gary Lee Walt saved.
can't say I blame him.
so Ryan hires Jayson Walt to work his party.
he wants to get him alone, on his turf...
except it's the wrong Santa.
Ryan panics. Can't believe what he's done.
goes inside and gets rid of the evidence.
he runs back upstairs to be with his kid, wishing he could will it all away.
me, too.
cause now, that kid's going to lose both his parents.
Las Vegas Police!
go, go, go.
it's okay. You're safe, son.
I'm a policeman.
some men came. They took my daddy.
I heard Ryan Bonham's missing. What the hell happened to him?
Yeah, some guys broke in. They trashed the place.
I had a bad feeling. When the fake Santa, Jayson Walt, made bail, he disappeared.
bet he figured out Ryan tried to kill him?
that's a safe bet.
and what about the kid, Blake?
well, you know, he's okay. He's a little shaken up.
yeah? Did he see anything?
I don't know. He'll only talk to one person.
who?
me?!
last time I saw him, I scared him.
he said he wanted to talk to-- and I quote-- "the funny science man.
a compliment, I suppose, but...you got to help me out here.
just relax. Engage him.
here. Give him this.
chocolate. Get him talking. I'm sure he saw something.
this is a bad idea. I'm gonna screw this up.
just, you know, give it your best shot.
little man.
sorry. I'm allergic.
Yeah. Me, too.
I like your watch. I used to have one just like it.
it's purple.
good color. And the diode display.
groundbreaking technology for its day.
not that you...
you're a science man, right? You know big words.
sure. I-I know some big words.
did the people with your daddy use big words?
when they were going, one man yelled at the other man.
he was mad because he hadn't gotten his condestorb fixed.
do you mean "condenser"?
Yeah! What is that?
it's a machine that helps freeze things.
did you see the truck the men came in, Blake?
Yeah, when they drove up. When my dad told me to hide.
and was it the same truck that was at the party at your house?
will my daddy be okay?
as long as he knows what a great, smart son he has, he's gonna be just fine.
he's a very lucky daddy.
Thanks.
traffic cam caught Jayson Walt's ice truck turning off I-15 onto 215 East one hour ago.
I'm guessing that Ryan Bonham is in the back, on ice, and they're taking him out of town.
Yeah, but I don't get it. Why didn't they just kill him at the house?
maybe Ryan has something they want.
so, where do you think they're going?
my guess is someplace isolated, where they feel safe... so they can rough him up.
maybe... where they make their ice.
why you say that?
because when I analyzed the melted snow, there was no chlorine in the water.
and all of Las Vegas' tap water adds chlorine.
if I test the diatoms in the melted snow, I might be able to...pinpoint the water source.
give us a location.
so, that party snow came from a small lake near Henderson.
so that's where the truck's going.
Yeah, I ran property records in Henderson.
turns out the Walt brothers have had a warehouse there since the early '90s.
good work, Greg.
well, I hope it's not too late.
Where's the box of bank records?
stop it. Please stop! Stop.
I'll show you where it is.
no, you're gonna tell me where to find it!
I can't tell you where to find it!
hold it, hold it, hold it.
you a lefty or a righty, Ryan? - What?
Aw, it doesn't matter anyway.
go on. Power it up!
you know, cops said someone was trying to kill me-- Santa stabbed in the back. At your house.
pretty easy to figure out!
you know, the thing about this ice chipper, see, you're lucky if it only takes an arm.
lot of times, once you get something in there, no turning back, Ryan!
you listening to me?
last chance, Ryan! I'm tired of waiting.
all right, if that's how you want it!
Las Vegas Police! Put down your weapons!
back off or I put a bullet in his head!
put the gun down, Jayson.
I will do it!
well, so will I.
I'll bust a cap right in your kidneys. I'll kill you and your brother.
put the gun down.
shoot him!
they killed my wife! Do it!
put the gun down, Jayson.
you should've killed him.
Ryan Bonham, you're under arrest.
get him out of here.
he made a full confession.
he admitted to killing Brad Fante by mistake.
he's lucky Jayson Walt didn't kill him.
he saw them coming. He told his kid to hide.
then when they busted in, he somehow convinced Jayson Walt that his wife had bank records that would incriminate both him and his brother.
there were no records.
buying time.
till we could find his kid.
Well...losing your wife like that...
anyway... Oh, there's been a little mix-up in Jayson Walt's custody.
a Henderson, Nevada, sheriff showed up-- he's a friend-- and I handed Jayson Walt over to him.
the weird thing is that his wristband number got transposed.
he got on the wrong bus.
where is he now?
he's shuffling off to Buffalo.
unbelievable, isn't it? The red tape.
could take months for him to get back to Las Vegas.
well, I guess he won't be giving his brother his kidney tomorrow, will he?
it's tragic, isn't it?
so, there are some people who will be here soon, very nice people, and, um, they're going to take you to see your grandparents, okay?
okay.
you know, Blake, um, this thing with you father, I'm sure it's hard for you to understand.
he misses my mom.
I'm sure he does.
I do, too.
have you ever read The Lost Reindeer?
I've only heard the first part.
I always wondered what happened to that reindeer.
we can skip to the end.
"Winston turned the corner and what did he see?"
"a hundred reindeer just as lost as he."
"they laughed and sang until night faded away."
"as long as they had each other, every moment was Christmas Day."
the end.
David, you're my hero. Your secret santa, Morgan
I'm standing live in front of the Berman estate where the casino mogul's wife has been killed... Mr. Berman, I've been told, is nowhere to be found.
what? Yeah, you. Do a 180 and take a hike.
I don't care about freedom of the press.
move the perimeter back. Move it back.
and somebody shut that damn dog up.
where is Lee Berman?! Where's the husband?
Metcalf, Smith, put out a broadcast!
I want to talk to him in ten minutes.
turn the car off.
step out of the vehicle and get your hands in the air.
do you know who I am?
I own the Tangiers. Ring a bell?
one call to Sheriff Ecklie, and I turn you all into mall cops.
looks like we got a gun in the car, boys. Nine-millimeter.
don't cuff him yet, Akers. This is a red flag case.
spin him around here. I'll process him on site.
right hand. Palm down.
okay, now you can hook him.
Mr. Berman, you are under arrest for suspicion of murder.
murder? Who died?
your wife.
Oh, there you go.
smart house, right?
you walk into the room, lights go on. You walk out, they go off.
Yeah, I know. Me and Umbrella Man just lit up together.
I'm assuming that one of the 18 cameras outside got a good look at our killer.
actually, someone outsmarted the smart house.
alarm system and surveillance cameras were disabled at 4: 17 a. m. for an hour.
remotely.
the good news is the motion sensors still tracked the path of entry:
from the garage, down the hall, through the foyer, into the master bedroom.
in and out in less than six minutes.
no wrong turns.
whoever killed Audrey Berman was familiar with the house.
first two shots were not immediately fatal.
third shot, she wasn't so lucky.
she gave it a valiant effort.
almost made it to those doors.
nine-mil.
same caliber as the gun that Nick found in Berman's car.
so busy killing his wife, he forgot to pick up the casings.
crime of passion.
look at hers.
she also took over both sides of the closet.
so I'm thinking that Mr. Berman moved out of this room a while ago.
well, hello there.
Where'd you go?
Hey, boss. Thanks for getting back to me.
did you ask for a plane?
Yes, sir, I did request a plane.
that's out of the question.
wait, hear me out.
you know the "Kitty" case that I've been tracking?
Yeah. Well, one of her targets, Lee Berman - - his wife was murdered.
And?
which tells me our Node is there.
but for how long?
Ryan, we don't have the resources to send you out there at this time.
sir, with all due respect, you know these cybercriminals-- they're like gophers.
if you don't grab 'em when they pop their head out, they're gone forever.
I'll see what I can do. - Clock's ticking.
Ryan... - I got to get to Vegas.
special Agent Ryan.
I had an up and back to St. Thomas until the deputy director called. Ordered me to detour to Vegas.
with all due respect, ma'am, we're not running a taxi service here.
so why don't you save Uncle Sam a couple of bucks and fly commercial.
captain, I'm gonna tell you three things about yourself, none of which you're gonna like.
number one, there's no such thing as an up and back to the Virgin Islands, you go there, you're staying the night.
and your returning there, it's not for Mrs. Captain.
number two, you and I both know, morally...
okay. Wheels up. Let's get Agent Ryan to Vegas.
grab my bags.
okay, gentlemen, this is Las Vegas.
I'll deal.
when was the last time you saw your wife?
yesterday morning.
I got you beat.
we saw her last night.
I didn't kill my wife.
here's a photo of the nine-mil we found on the front seat of your Aston Martin.
these are the shell casings that you left behind in your wife's bedroom.
also nine-millimeter.
now, that's the only evidence we have of you in that room.
I want to know everything about this girl.
who is she? And where is she?
okay. Let me play it out for you.
your marriage is a bust.
nevada's a community property state, right?
it's a classic trade-up.
you killed your wife to be with her.
now, as the comics in the lounge act at the Tangiers like to say, how am I doing?
this Brass is good.
and he's asking all the right questions; just not my question.
do you mind if we change dealers?
good morning, Mr. Berman.
FBI Special Agent Ryan. Cyber Crimes Division.
I'm not gonna ask you if you murdered your wife.
I'm more interested in a relationship you've been having with a woman online.
her name's Kitty, right?
the way your pupils just dilated,
I'd say there was a little more than chitchat going on in that chat.
Ten-Stars-VIP. com. That ring a bell?
an exclusive VIP sex site for affluent men willing to pay for anonymity.
I could say more.
everyone with a law degree, take a hike.
Mr. Berman, I strong...
want to know something funny?
you and I were both seeing Kitty.
so, I log in under an assumed name, Ralph, a lonely rancher from Montana.
after about a month, Kitty sends me a virtual gift.
and when I refuse to open it, she kicks me off the site.
so back at Quantico, I'm trying everything.
I get male agents to log in under assumed names.
but even when we open the gift, still she kicks us off the site.
you want to know why?
cause Kitty is only interested in wealthy men that she can verify.
well-known men, like you.
you opened the gift, didn't you?
I didn't get any gift.
I'm a behavioral scientist.
fancy for "human lie detector."
okay. I got a gift.
I opened it.
the chat box went away, and I could talk to her.
no more typing.
hands-free, so to speak.
how long did this honeymoon last?
a week. Ten days.
then it ended. I ended it.
you're lying again.
here's my big question:
what did Kitty have on you?
call my lawyers back in here.
ran facial recognition on our mystery woman. No hits in the Nevada DMV.
you're not gonna find her in any database.
it's okay. I can help you with that.
everybody, uh, this is Special Agent Ryan.
she's a cyber psychologist, specializing in cyber forensics, and I'm afraid I don't know anything else.
may I?
Clikk, you there?
Yes, ma'am. - Get me into Kitty.
logging into Ten-Stars-VIP. com. White label user.
all I need is a name. All right, CSI, give me a name.
Hodges. That's a good name.
all right, stand up.
are you a sex site guy?
no, ma'am.
you ever been on Ten-Stars-VIP. com?
no, ma'am.
mm, you sure about that?
first name?
uh, that would be David.
Clikk, verify David Hodges.
Oh, it's the FBI, man - - you're toast.
a little deceptive on the sex sites.
but he's never been to Ten-Stars-VIP.
okay...
at ease, stud. Just... just fall back.
you are science cops.
I'm a cyber cop. I work crimes that start in the mind, live online and play out in the real world.
you work dark alleys. I work the dark Net.
you chase suspects.
I chase Nodes.
node, short for "bad guy." Little childlike drawing.
this iceberg represents the Internet.
and believe it or not, the world only uses this top four percent.
the tip. The surface Web. I work down here, in the 96%, in the deep Web, where criminals are anonymous, where money... is untraceable, and where everything illegal's for sale.
and what does this have to do with Mr. Berman?
well, Berman's having a relationship with your mystery woman, a woman named Kitty - - and Kitty...
she's one of a kind.
what's your name?
because the more you pet me, the more I purr.
what's your name?
David. Kitty - - ooh, I like that.
Oh, I like sex.
I like sex, too.
what are you into?
everything.
name it.
how many legs on a bicycle?
so, you're a leg man?
how many bicycles on a leg?
you want to ride me?
wow, she always brings it right back to sex.
sex is her business.
now, we're gonna have a little fun.
I'm gonna frustrate the algorithm with a nonresponsive response.
you want to ride me? You want to ride me hard?
chain. Yank. Sweat.
wet. Bleed. Finger. Lick.
tongue. Ass. Ride.
ride. Ride. Ride. Ride.
Ri...
ride. Ride. Ride. Ride.
ride. Ride. Ride. Ride. Ride...
what the hell kind of sex site is this?
RYAN: My team has been tracking Kitty for six weeks.
she is a computer-animated avatar chatbot with machine-learning artificial intelligence.
okay, good, we're all caught up now.
so...
she's not real.
but the person who created her is.
that's why I'm here.
what's with the mushrooms?
it's in my nature to nurture.
I guess I threw you a little curveball with Kitty, didn't I? You know, all this cyber hocus-pocus is fascinating, but...
now what?
I still have a dead woman downstairs, a casino mogul with GSR on his hands, a gun on the front seat.
up until now, I've been thinking that Lee Berman killed his wife for a...a younger woman online.
you come along, you tap a few keys, and then you reduce our motive to a bunch of digital bits.
so...
Where's that leave me?
can you cut me CSI Finlay? I'm bucking time here.
I really need to get into the husband's computer.
why her?
men. Sex sites. They're time assassins.
fine with me. But Lee Berman's computer wiped out right in my hands, so...
was a sledge hammer involved?
no.
then... the data's still there.
Oh, look. Virus detected.
two-way camera enabled on Berman's computer.
a gift from Kitty. There are some gifts that should never be opened.
here's what I suspect happened to Berman.
no more chat box. No more typing.
you can see me. I wish I could see you.
now, let's put those hands to good use.
he was so happy to be hands-free, he had no idea he was being recorded.
Yeah, you're doing great. You're doing great.
so Berman made a sex tape and didn't even know it.
people forget the cameras on their laptops, their tablets, their cell phones.
they're cameras.
they record.
I figured if rich guys like Berman were being targeted, money was the end game.
and the good news about his two-way cam is that it recorded every one of their encounters.
everything from their first hello to their last good-bye.
I imagine you pinning me down, taking me against my will.
wait.
I want you to dominate me.
she can't feel pain; she's not real.
then why is she massaging her jaw?
it's usually the sign of an underlying medical condition.
don't you want to see how it ends?
I was just bringing this to you. Saves me the trip.
what do we got?
nine-mil, right? Thank you.
Hi, Doc. - D. B.
what a shame.
Audrey Berman was a great lady.
heart of gold when it came to this town, and a very good friend of mine, too.
can't say the same for her husband.
it's always the better half that gets punished for the other half's sins.
what do you got there?
is that a bruise on the ring finger?
minute abrasions along the knuckle.
they weren't apparent at the scene.
developed since we brought her in.
wedding ring wasn't in her personal effects.
wasn't in evidence, either.
this is one of the biggest diamonds I've ever seen.
instant divorce.
how we doing on those bullets?
bullets from the wife don't match the gun from the husband's car.
Nick processed on site.
Berman's hands were positive for GSR.
I know, but the stria don't match. Berman have a carry permit? I checked.
he is a regular member of the Gun Club off Blue Diamond.
well, there you go.
GSR on guns is like paint - - it sticks around.
maybe long enough to transfer to his hands when he handled it last night.
if the gun wasn't the murder weapon, though, why did Berman have it in the first place?
there's got to be a reason.
how's it going?
Hey, good, good.
uh, I know that Greg was jocking Berman's smart house, but I don't think he saw this smart car, man. It's amazing.
it's like a detective on wheels. You just give it a CSI badge and a field kit.
I did run diagnostics.
according to CSI Aston, from the Tangiers,
Berman manually entered his GPS coordinates at 4: 15 a. m.
arriving at his destination, Industrial Park, at 5: 13 a. m.
and then, of course, I handcuffed him at 5: 37.
so he was nowhere near the scene.
he couldn't have killed his wife.
but that doesn't mean he didn't pay for it.
that bag I found in the trunk could have been used for a money drop.
okay, so...
what do we think? Berman hires some guy to kill his wife, meets him in the park an hour later for the payoff.
I mean... that does fit the timeline.
I'm not sure it fits the logic, though.
I mean, what's a guy like Lee Berman doing driving an Aston Martin around Industrial Park at 5: 00 in the morning with a gun on his seat?
yeah...
we're missing something.
this may be what you're missing.
you're gonna pay, or you're gonna pay.
a hundred thousand - - that was one thing. 250?
now you want a half a million dollars?
I'm done.
you're done when I say you're done.
now it's a million.
you don't want to play ball with me. I will kill your whole family.
who do you want to see in a casket first, your wife or your kids?
you leave them out of this.
now it's $2 million.
you say another word, and it's four.
same drill - - wire the money, convert it to bitcoins.
forget bitcoins. I want a face-to-face!
I'm in charge now! My terms!
industrial Park off Blue Diamond! Cash on delivery!
I am ending this tonight!
you do love me.
and that was the last time that they spoke.
classic extortion.
how does an avatar programmed for sex turn so sadistic?
Kitty's not a sadist. Her creator is. A psycho-sadist.
most likely male.
he derives pleasure from inflicting pain on others.
physical, emotional, financial.
Berman didn't pay to have his wife killed.
he paid the sadist to spare her.
but he didn't spare her. She's dead.
the second that Berman initiated this power struggle with his "my terms" bravado, the sadist got pissed.
so he killed Berman's wife and he took his money.
which means Berman's the only person who's ever seen this guy.
first you tell me this girl is fake, and now you're telling me the guy who was shaking me down killed my wife?
Hey, Mr. Berman, we have you on tape agreeing to pay $2 million cash.
question is, who'd you give it to?
you can't pay $2 million to a chatbot. So who'd you pay the money to?
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
there never was any cash, was there?
you went to the Industrial Park - - not to pay Kitty, but to kill her.
and when you got there, I'm guessing all you had was your gun in your hand.
gun in my hand?
that's a polite way to say it.
no one showed.
I didn't say it before because...
because I was ashamed.
I'm fooling around online and...
it gets my wife killed.
that's the first honest thing you've said.
I'd like to thank both the FBI and the LVPD for proving what we knew all along.
Mr. Berman is innocent. And we're out of here.
Kitty. Kitty. It's you. What the hell is going on?
they said she wasn't real!
calm down!
I'm looking for the person who gave my picture to the press.
my name is Susan McDowell. I'm from San Diego.
I'm cooking dinner for my little girls. I look up and I'm all over the TV.
the other woman in a love triangle.
every story mentions the Las Vegas Police Department.
I drove five hours. I want answers.
I understand. I want some myself.
I put your photo out there.
the FBI is working a case, and you're a person of interest.
person of interest? Are you kidding me?
do you use social networks?
are you even listening to me?
I have a husband overseas serving his country.
I am trying to hold my family together.
that guy in the hall, he is not the first person to call me Kitty.
what about Facebook? Instagram? Snapchat?
vine?
Yes. I'm on Friend Agenda.
my husband's stationed in Afghanistan. It's the only way we get to see each other.
how often are you on it?
every day. I send Bradley photos and videos of the girls.
I post whatever I can to bring our life to him.
do you grind your teeth at night?
how do you know that?
you're massaging your jaw. You have an idiosyncratic medical condition.
I'm guessing it's TMJ.
it started when my husband deployed.
it's how I knew you were out there. And it's why I released her photo.
Mrs. McDowell, someone took your face, your body and your mannerisms, and they made a virtual you.
they gave it a name, Kitty, and they put it on a sex site.
the guy who did it is now making millions of dollars.
how could he do that?
I think we need to assess your social vulnerability.
this is your Friend Agenda page.
do you recognize any of these six people?
WittyGirl285 is a girl I went to school with.
BarbaraSD is an over-caffeinated mom trying to set up a playdate.
I don't know the other four.
today, these are the top six people who viewed your site.
not your friends. Your wannabe friends.
your top hit is Nebula1. Who's he?
I have no clue.
well, he visited your site 2, 507 times in the last six months.
that's 15 times a day.
playdate mom? She was there two times a week.
that guy hiding behind the smiley face - - he's the one that did this to me?
2, 500 times? Really?
I have two little girls. What if this guy comes after us?
I'll protect you.
I give you my word.
Mr. Berman...
listen, until we catch your wife's killer, I think it would be a good idea for you to stay at the hotel.
little extra layer of security.
I don't know what you want to do about your dog.
dog? I don't have a dog.
where you going, bud? Come here.
nice pooch, Nick.
thank you.
nice pooch, Nick. - Yeah, thanks.
Hey, so I finally figured out how the killer knew his way around the Berman house.
place was up for sale a few years ago and the, uh, 360 virtual walk-through is still online.
all the killer had to do was take the tour and he knew every inch of the place.
scary. Something that is supposed to help you sell your house ends up being a blueprint to kill your wife.
Yeah, he'd still have to get past guard shacks, armed security and electronic sensor gates. It's like Shawshank over there.
I worked a grand theft horse case there a while back.
community's zoned for four-legged friends.
residents ride their horses in and out of there all the time.
well, that's how he did it.
where there's a horse trail, there's a dog trail.
maybe security thought this guy was just walking his dog.
that's how he got past them.
Yeah, and then once onto the Berman property, he didn't need the dog anymore, so he let her loose.
that's okay, sweetie.
uncle Hodges is gonna adopt you when all this is over.
no, he's not. Uncle Greg is.
but I am going to scan you with my "ARF"-ID Reader.
shelter dog. Rescued into a life of crime.
okay, get a shot of her for me, will you?
Yeah.
say cheese, sweetie.
cheese, sweetie.
got your text. What do you got?
well, this is a first. Our killer adopted a death-imminent mongrel dog.
you know, a mutt. But he made a mistake.
he left a copy of his driver's license at the dog pound.
the information is bogus, but the girl at the counter I. D.'d the photo.
so I'm looking at our killer.
it gets better. Nick saw a security camera in the parking lot of the animal shelter.
we ran the plate.
rental? - Affirmative. Time to LoJack this jackass.
control, this is Two Zero Three Charlie, Captain Brass.
we're at the LoJack-identified site. Eyes on a silver Ford. Nevada plates. Adam, King, Sam, Henry, Four, One, Three.
key's still in the ignition, Jim.
well, you have evidence. But no one to tie it to.
he knew that.
that's why he left it all behind.
ballistics confirmed that's the murder weapon.
no prints. No DNA.
we tracked down Berman's jeweler.
he's the one who identified the ring.
five carat rock.
worth over $2 million. - Great payday for a killer.
untraceable.
I also processed the disposable phone.
there were only two numbers in memory.
one from an animal shelter and one from a rental car agency.
the only thing probative, really, is the video.
wait, there's a video on a disposable cell phone?
Oh, yeah.
play it.
you okay?
I missed it.
Hey, slow down, will you?
what did you miss? Something on that snuff film?
it's not a snuff film. It's proof of kill.
so he gets hired for future hits.
wait... You're saying that the guy who created Kitty is a hit man?
no, no, no.
the man who created Kitty is a psycho-sadist.
he derives pleasure from inflicting pain to others.
he would never tape himself killing somebody. He is the one I'm after.
don't you see?
my psycho-sadist hired your hit man.
so, your Node...
was never even in Vegas. And that's what I missed.
so, now we're looking for two ghosts.
mine is underground, and yours is halfway around the world.
brass called Interpol. They put out a worldwide broadcast on our hit man.
hopefully they'll get a bead on him so they can drag his ass back to Vegas.
when's the last time you changed your profile picture?
I don't know, probably after I shaved my beard off.
good, you're controlling your self-image.
so's he. Before Nebula1 was a smiley face, this is what he looked like.
Oh, yeah, that rates really high on the creepy meter.
Nebula1 - - what's that all about?
nebula means dark mist.
he thinks he's beyond our reach.
tell me, what do you see?
the obvious? Um...
Caucasian male, 20s, button-up shirt, books, family photos, window, blinds. And from what I can tell, it's nighttime.
put it in context.
barbells on the floor. Guy works out.
he's antisocial. He doesn't like the gym.
Yeah, and he doesn't like to take out the trash, either.
cans are stuffed.
to-go cups, food containers. He orders in a lot.
he's agoraphobic. He doesn't like to leave.
not even to eat. Well, we need to I. D. him, right?
guy's got a lot of family photos there.
if they were his family.
what do you mean?
blood is thicker than water, but it's not thicker than a watermark.
back up the bus. He downloaded a fake family?
everything you see here is staged.
family photos communicate that he's a good person.
books are supposed to make us believe that he's intelligent.
blinds are closed so we don't know where he lives.
why did you say it was nighttime?
I don't know. I mean, I can see stars through the blinds.
what, he stage those, too?
no. No. That's an oversight.
it's Gestalt theory of good continuation.
looks like an arch.
it's the Gateway Arch. He's in St. Louis.
I'll triangulate coordinates.
clear!
clear! Clear? - What do you mean, "clear"?
no suspect on the premises.
ma'am, you need to see this.
we've got a whole nerve center here.
computers, hard drives, the works.
Oh, looks like he's still in business, but if he never leaves the house, then where is he?
give me the ceiling. All four corners.
he's got a Web cam!
he's watching us! It's a trap!
get out! Extract! Extract!
go! Go! Everybody out! Go!
figured I'd find you out here.
Hey, you saved all those men's lives today.
unfortunately, the evidence didn't fair so well. We lost DNA, prints
all the hardware was incinerated.
Oh. Is that right, D.B? Well, yes, Avery, it is.
I found a photo of Susan's house on her phone.
she never posted it to Friend Agenda.
if I upload it, he'll know where she lives.
you're thinking of putting her in play?
I applied some pressure. I got an agoraphobe to leave his house.
we could lure him.
he is moveable.
and now you want to move him again and use Susan to do it.
but you're on the fence about it?
the Internet amplifies crime.
if my Node gets away with this, his cyber cred will be immortalized.
he will spawn hundreds, if not thousands, of copycatters.
so, it's Susan versus the greater good.
I looked that woman in the eye, and I promised her I would protect her.
we are talking about a woman and two little girls.
do you want my opinion?
greater good. Put her in play.
I've got you covered.
my name is Susan McDowell.
my husband's a Marine proudly serving in Afghanistan.
I am a mother of two girls.
I thought I was tough, that I could handle anything.
then someone hacked into my life, hijacked all my photos online, used my likeness, my face, my body, put me on the Internet, where I was virtually raped by thousands of men.
there is no law against what this man did to me.
there is no law against what this man did to me.
but I was violated.
virtual rape...
is rape. - ...is rape.
and I refuse to stand back and do nothing.
and I refuse to stand by and do nothing.
Susan, you can do this.
the difference between a victim and victory is action.
take back your life.
provoke him, expose him for what he is.
you see this?
this is what he turned me into.
a whore, a prostitute.
he's selling my body to thousands of men around the world 24/7.
as of today, I'm shutting you down.
and so here's my message to all you men out there.
log off and check into your families.
don't let this coward win.
agent Ryan, I've been tracking Nebula1's activity on Friend Agenda since you announced her press conference.
in the last hour, he's peeped her page 900, 000 times.
he D. O. S.'d her?
he's so angry, he crashed her site.
you wanted obsession. You got it.
we're going to San Diego.
you're a cop.
you're a sadist.
Where's Kitty? You mean Susan?
you're confused.
Susan is real, Kitty is not.
I created Kitty. I made her.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
is that a . 45?
I guarantee you it's never been fired.
I've had bigger guns pointed at my face.
wait till you see my other gun.
I saw it.
the one your hit man used to kill Audrey Berman?
I thought I'd do this one myself.
I thought you'd be more of a blade man.
she just got him to trade down.
how long are we gonna play this waiting game?
we wait for Agent Ryan's code word.
you going to cut me?
you like to watch me bleed?
Yeah.
you want me to cut you again?
are you hearing that?
Yeah. She's adding years to his sentence.
tell me about the first time.
I was eight years old...
and I cut my sister's breasts with a straight razor.
I got no problem cutting you.
well, I do.
I'm out of here.
you're not going anywhere!
have you ever been murdered before?
mushroom.
drop it!
drop it! Drop it!
stay down!
stay down! You're under arrest for attempted murder of a federal agent, conspiracy to commit murder, extortion and a thousand counts of being a creep.
say bye-bye to your Wi-Fi.
you all right?
I'll feel a lot better when you get our hit man behind bars.
you're something else.
Oh, my God.
thank you so much for bringing us down here.
the girls are so excited.
they want to be pilots just like their dad.
girls!
daddy!
daddy!
you brought my husband home?
after all you've been through, you both deserve a hero's welcome.
thank you.
that was nice.
so, this is good-bye, I guess, huh?
well, for now.
where you off to?
Oh, bank robbery, Pittsburgh.
how much? - Three cents.
Oh, give me a break. Talk to me. How much?
three copper pennies...from 80 million checking accounts.
$2. 4 million a week.
makes for one hell of a heist.
check your bank statements. - No kidding.
and they say there's no such thing as the perfect crime.
it's not the perfect crime.
it's cyber crime.
do you guys ever think maybe we should fix up the shack a little?
it's fine.
why fix it? Yeah.
I don't know, in case we ever bring girls here or something.
Scotty, what girls are we gonna bring besides your mom or your sister?
you know what? Fine. Never mind.
yo, guys.
the shack door's open.
is that blood?
Oh, man, we should go. Come on!
is he dead?
he's not moving.
that's a lot of blood.
looks like he got shot or something.
smooth move, ex-lax!
you guys, money.
and a lot of it.
holy crap. We need to go call the cops.
what?
well, it doesn't look like he's gonna be making that 3: 10 to Yuma, eh, Super Dave?
I'd say he's caught his last ride.
name is Roger Mathers, according to his Texas driver's license.
single bullet wound to the chest.
nice powder ring around the entry wound.
looks like he was hiking in the desert, judging from all the dirt and burrs in his socks.
Yeah, well, there's no shortage of that around here.
no.
Hey, uh, give me a second, will you? - Yeah.
this is, uh, CSI Nick Stokes.
this is Sheriff Combs. He's the local law.
Stokes. How's it going?
sheriff was telling me he knew the victim.
but he's from Texas. How'd you know him?
well, he might've been living in Texas now, but Roger Mathers was born and raised right here in Ellis Springs.
I knew him as a kid.
the sheriff was telling me that the victim had a moment of fame, or infamy, depending upon how you look at it.
Yeah, back when they were kids, he and a couple of buddies-- they had the bad luck to run across an armed robbery.
one of the kids got killed.
shook up the town pretty bad.
excuse me, I got to take this.
Yeah, go for Brass.
and what the hell was he doing way out here?
loot from the robbery was never recovered.
there's a million-dollar treasure out here just waiting to be found.
local lore-- they say it's still out here somewhere.
what is it, Jim?
that was about my daughter.
what's wrong?
she, uh, just tried to kill herself.
we've got an O. D. Female, late 20s. Attempted suicide. Cocktail of clozapine, olanzapine.
breathing steady, but shallow. BP: 85/40.
get her into three and throw up - another bag of ringers, stat. - Yes, Doctor.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm Captain Jim Brass.
captain, I'm gonna need you to wait. As soon as she's stable, I'll find you.
we just heard. So sorry.
how you doing?
I don't know.
D. A. said Ellie was here for a preliminary hearing.
she was in a holding cell. She's obviously, uh, stockpiling her meds.
I mean, I don't think she wanted to kill herself.
you know, her attorney is, uh, filing an insanity plea.
it might be some screwed-up way of strengthening their case.
whatever's going on, this is where you need to be.
and don't even think about the Ellis Springs case. We got it covered.
you just take care of things here.
Thanks.
Hey, Sara, find anything in the treasure hunter's car?
well, he wasn't a health food nut, that's for sure.
looks like he ran a solar business down in Plano.
his name's on the back as the company owner.
are you kidding me? Selling solar in Texas?
what? Texas doesn't have sun?
Texas has oil.
when I was growing up, you mention something like this, it was blasphemy.
well, these might put your mind at ease.
gasoline receipts.
looking at the where and the whens of his fill-ups,
I would say that he drove straight through from Texas to get here.
well, why was he in such a hurry?
I don't know.
and what is that? Piece of a photo.
I found it on the ground near the car. Can't find the rest of it.
well, it kind of looks like an aerial photo.
don't you think?
maybe the lore is true. Aerial photo of the area could've been the victim's treasure map.
so, I called on down to Texas, and I spoke with someone at the victim's company.
did they say why he came racing up here?
you know, my guess is he was racing away from there.
turns out, he had serious money troubles.
his company is going under. Got to say, if I found a buried treasure, I'd spend it on something far more exciting than saving my failing company.
what do you got in mind?
like a crazy trip or a sexy sports car.
something like that. Uh-huh.
so, there are definitely prints on that piece of photo you brought in, but pretty much all of them belong to the victim.
pretty much all of them"?
well, there is one partial print that's not his, but it's not enough to run.
it's interesting though; it looks like a tented arch pattern.
which is really rare. I mean, only, what, five percent of the population has that.
well, Nick just got the phone records of our victim.
he made five calls on his drive from Texas to here. All of them to Tyson Briggs.
who's Tyson Briggs?
he's one of the other two kids that got tangled in the heist 25 years ago.
so, were you and Roger still close? You guys still talk?
no, not really.
everything changed after that day.
that's why it was so weird, him calling out of the blue like that.
What'd he want?
wanted to get together.
and did you? - Yeah.
I thought it'd be good to see him, you know? Get caught up.
but all Roger could talk about was money.
he was kind of frantic. Panicked even.
he must've been in a pretty deep hole.
was he talking about looking for buried treasure?
you know, the money from the '89 heist?
that was why he was here; that's why he came back.
that money was gonna be the answer to all his problems.
well, how would he know where to look for it?
well, he didn't say.
and tell you the truth, man, I really wasn't that interested.
look, man, I'm not trying to talk bad about the guy now.
no, that's all right. I understand. Go ahead.
the whole time me and Roger were together, he didn't once mention Scotty.
he just kept going on about the money and the treasure and how bad he needed it, man.
he didn't... man, he didn't have one single thought about Scotty.
and, Scotty, that's the... the boy who was killed?
Yeah, we lost our best friend that day.
please, mister, don't shoot us! We won't tell anyone.
what the hell?
what are you guys doing?
we just came here to hang out, mister, I...
shut up!
Hey, bro.
it's the best I could do.
I couldn't go back to town.
Ben! No! Damn it!
you.
grab the bags. You're coming with me.
get over there! - No. No, please! I don't want to go!
pick up the money now!
you two are gonna stay here.
be quiet or your friend here dies.
you get it?
shut up. Pick up the money!
pick it up!
guys! Guys! Guys! Guys!
guys, help!
we ran as fast as we could back to town to get the sheriff.
by that time, it was too late. We never saw Scotty again.
I grew up with two great friends, man. You know, the kind you never forget.
now they're both gone.
well, I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Briggs.
Yeah, yeah.
I just heard about Ellie.
how is she?
she's in an induced coma.
she's stable, so...
how are you holding up?
after all that's happened, I don't even know what the hell I'm doing here.
there's a part of me that wishes she would just not wake up.
I mean, I know how horrible that sounds, but, uh...
she's put you through a lot, Jim.
you know she's here for a court hearing, right?
she's gonna testify in a court that I drove her to madness.
to murder.
you are not responsible for what she did. Or what she's done to herself.
I'm not so sure.
so, what do we got on our murdered treasure hunter?
well, we are working on that right now.
we just pulled all the files from the original '89 case.
these were our suspects involved. A pair of local brothers.
paul and Ben O'Malley.
they robbed the house of a mid-level Mob boss named Michael Scarno, and in the process, one of them was shot.
according to the police report, they made off with close to a hundred grand and some valuables.
that's all?
Nick talked like there was this big treasure involved.
well, the cash and watches are part of the official theft report.
but I remember when I was writing my Vegas Mob book,
I heard about this Michael Scarno.
he was an art theft guy, and he had acquired a particular piece of sculpture.
a Persian-stone lion.
wow, that's over 2, 000 years old.
and it was just one of a pair.
the other one just sold at a British auction for close to $10 million.
well, that could explain the "why now" of it all.
could be that our victim heard about the auction and then went looking for the remaining statue.
how do the three local kids fit into the original story?
wrong place at the wrong time.
the older O'Malley found them in a railroad shack.
brother was dead.
O'malley then tried to make a getaway and took one of the younger kids with him.
O'malley was caught two hours later out near Hoover Dam, but by then, the boy and the cash were gone.
now, the sheriff has always contended that the kid ended up at the bottom of Lake Mead.
the body was never found?
O'malley didn't say what he did with the kid?
he never got a chance to.
he was found dead in his jail cell the next morning.
no body. No money. No trial.
seems a little bit more than sketchy, don't you think?
case of small-town justice, maybe?
or small-town corruption.
maybe the local cops knew what kind of stash Scarno was sitting on.
so this is what's left of Scotty Gates.
an entire kid's existence comes down to a baseball hat and a pair of glasses.
Oh, I can't even imagine what his parents must've been going through.
wait a minute. Looks like a partial print.
it could be a tented arch.
Sara said she found a tented arch at the Roger Mathers murder scene.
I got your text.
you said it was urgent.
I was looking through the evidence from the '89 case, and I found a fingerprint.
it's only a partial-- not enough to run.
don't tell me it has a tented arch.
it does.
okay, so the one on the left is from the torn photo that you guys found this morning, and the one on the right is from Scotty Gates' glasses, 25 years ago.
could they really be the same?
it's a match.
the fingerprint belongs to a man named Sam Bishop.
he is a security guard now, but back in '89, he was a deputy in Ellis Springs under Sheriff Combs.
and get this-- he left the department two weeks after the whole thing with Scotty Gates and the heist.
goes a long way to support our theory of a crooked cop.
we have his fingerprints at both murder scenes.
could be our killer, I guess, covering up his crimes of the past.
let's take the back.
can I help you with something?
uh, LVPD. Who are you?
Karen Bishop. I live here.
we're looking for Sam Bishop.
we'd like to have a word with him.
um... yeah. I'll let him know you're here.
no, no. You know what? That's fine.
we'll tell him ourselves. Thank you.
excuse me, you can't go in there.
ma'am.
LVPD. We need to talk.
let me guess-- about Scotty Gates' murder?
I've been waiting 25 years for you to come.
you boys are arresting me? You got to be kidding me.
we've got your prints at two murder scenes, Mr. Bishop.
Roger Mathers' last night and Scotty Gates' 25 years ago.
what the hell are you talking about?
my father wasn't involved in any murder.
we have a warrant to search the premises as well.
you have absolutely no idea what you're doing, do you?
get him out of here.
you're making a huge mistake.
my father is a good man.
well, we'll have a look around, see for ourselves.
the gun that was used to kill Roger Mathers was a nine-mil, right?
Yeah, but if it's hidden down here, we got our work cut out for us.
am I the only one getting a mad scientist vibe in here?
thought this guy was a former cop.
Ooh, have a look at this.
these are the boys from the '89 case.
old rabbit's foot.
like a kid would have.
could be a trophy the killer kept from Scotty Gates.
well, it's got an evidence tag on it.
and these are all old case files.
just who the hell is this guy?
assuming your people didn't find any murder weapon in my house.
no, they didn't, Mr. Bishop.
but what they did find was-was very interesting.
you're one of us, a criminalist.
you were working for Ellis Springs Sheriff Department back in 1989.
they called me a "hobbyist," actually.
well, that was a pretty heavy responsibility for a young deputy.
how'd that land on your back?
I volunteered.
I had a knack for science.
we're working an investigation into a murder that took place last night.
your fingerprint was on a torn photograph recovered at the scene.
can you explain that?
I retired years ago.
maybe you should figure that one out.
you didn't retire.
you were fired.
you were let go right after the 1989 heist, says here in your file, for insubordination.
there was no insubordination.
I found evidence that was, uh... inconvenient for Sheriff Combs.
quickest way to bury my evidence was to bury me.
why was the evidence "inconvenient" for the sheriff?
most charitable scenario?
local kid was gone, presumed dead, along with the two men responsible.
sheriff just wanted the case closed.
least charitable scenario?
sheriff was dirty.
in on the heist.
I suppose you have some evidence to back that up?
Ben and Paul O'Malley.
two brothers that ripped off Michael Scarno's house.
they were local troublemakers back then.
got arrested half a dozen times.
more than once, Sheriff Combs arranged for them to serve their time working on his house.
so you're saying that he knew them well.
well enough he could've hired them to pull off the robbery.
let's be careful about allegations that Sheriff Combs is dirty.
guy has over 30 years under his belt.
Yeah, well, 30 years doesn't take away his guilt if he was involved in the original robbery and murder.
but we don't know that.
come here. Come here.
let's say I play along.
let's say Sheriff Combs was involved in the original robbery, which ties him to the kid's death.
why would he kill Roger Mathers 25 years after the fact?
maybe Roger and the kids saw more that day than we realized.
now, Roger has come back, he's desperate for money.
maybe his next move is to try to blackmail the sheriff.
that's two "maybe"" in three sentences.
it does give him motive.
look, I'm not in the man's corner.
I'm just saying, proceed with caution.
this guy, Sam Bishop.
I'm looking at the forensics he was doing.
it's crazy.
I mean, he was way, way ahead of his time.
polymorphic protein analysis, analyzing gunshot residue.
he has his own formulas here for amino acid stains.
I found all of these aerial photos in Bishop's box.
they look a lot like the piece you found by the victim's car, but, I mean, there's not one that's a perfect match.
there's not one with a... with a tear on it or anything like that, which means Roger Mathers had the only copy.
he had the only treasure map.
explains why Sam Bishop's fingerprint was on it.
it was one of his photos.
question is: how did Roger Mathers get it?
Sam, these were your photos.
that's why your fingerprint's on the fragment that we found near Roger Mathers' car.
did you give him this photograph?
no. And I have no idea how he got it.
these are all original case photos.
been sitting in the same evidence box for 25 years.
they're very impressive, actually.
it's the kind of mapping we do with drones nowadays.
but you didn't have a drone back then, did you?
no.
but I had this.
I mounted a camera from a suspension rig slung beneath a weather balloon.
the camera's self-timer was modified to fire off an entire roll of film, automatically.
took about a week to map the region.
there was no better way to search for Scotty Gates' body.
Yeah, I'm-I'm gonna stop you right there, Sam.
see, I had a conversation with Michael Scarno's attorney.
discovered an interesting connection between you and the old crime boss.
he paid you for those photos, Sam, and that was after you got fired by Sheriff Combs.
hold on a minute. - You weren't looking for the kid's body.
Scarno hired you to find his missing loot, his treasure. - No, you don't understand...
are you going to deny that you were on Scarno's payroll?
no, I'm not.
Yes, I took the old man's money.
I'd just been fired, I had a little girl to raise.
but I never gave a damn about any missing loot, any treasure.
it was a chance to find Scotty.
Sam, we need the photo that Roger Mathers had last night.
where are the negatives?
there it is.
the photograph that Roger Mathers was carrying the night he was murdered.
the question is: what's so damn special about it that got him killed?
Sam Bishop must have scoured these photos back when he took them.
he didn't see anything.
Yeah, but he was working with 1989 technology.
hold it.
do you see that?
there's an irregular pattern in the ground.
looks like the dirt had been recently turned over.
I can run this against a current satellite photo, get the GPS coordinates.
well, we got to be close.
coordinates we have put us just about on top of it.
Yeah. I think we're there.
this is recent.
Yeah. This hole looks fresh.
look at the impression in the dirt here.
could be from the lion statue.
someone beat us to the treasure.
looks like a tennis shoe.
or it was, a long time ago.
that's a bone.
wasn't just the treasure that's buried here.
no.
this is Scotty Gates' grave.
here's the cast I pulled from the hole before they started digging.
sure looks like a match for the lion statue to me.
sidle: Yeah, we found a shovel, too.
so Scotty Gates and the statue were buried right here all this time.
I thought the story was that the kid ended up on the bottom of Lake Mead.
well, that's what Sheriff Combs has always said.
then again, I mean, you heard Sam Bishop's theory.
the sheriff was in on the heist.
speak of the devil.
so I have to hear through radio traffic that you discovered a grave.
we're still in the early stages.
if the remains you're digging up there are Scotty Gates,
I am still the lead detective on that case.
sheriff, right now, this is part of our investigation into the murder of Roger Mathers.
and you found no other evidence that would indicate this is part of my case?
you mean like a million-dollar statue?
everything here is going back to our lab.
we'll let you know what we find.
bishop: All these years, he was just a half-mile from town.
I should have found him.
Scotty's parents were devastated by his disappearance.
whole town was.
but his mother,
it just pushed her over the edge.
for weeks and months, she posted his picture all over town.
she never stopped looking for him, even though, in her heart, I think she knew he was dead.
hard to grieve without knowing what happened.
I promised her I'd find Scotty.
did everything I could, but in the end...
I let her down.
Sam, I want to apologize to you for the assumptions I made earlier.
gentlemen.
doc.
I spoke with the forensic odontologist.
dental records confirm the remains are definitely those of Scotty Gates.
okay, thanks.
anything else you can tell us?
well, obviously, my observations are limited by the advanced decomposition.
cause of death out of the question?
not necessarily.
I noticed some fracturing here and an indentation.
first, I thought it was the result of the body being buried for 25 years.
but on closer look, there seems to be some impact compression.
someone struck him in the head.
or he fell and hit his head; it's hard to say which.
do you mind?
no.
so this jagged mark here, that's the line of impact?
Yeah.
you can see the compression I mentioned.
what do you think?
it matches the base of the statue.
Scotty was killed with the stone lion.
whoever buried that was not hiding treasure.
they were ditching their murder weapon.
how did we get here, huh? How did we get here to this place?
was it because, uh, I wasn't your real father?
I mean, we never told you--we didn't think it was a big deal.
but maybe you instinctively knew and you held it against me.
is that it?
is...
I mean, the natural connection between a father and daughter, the bond-- we never had that.
was it because we didn't love each other?
I mean,
I thought I loved you.
I mean, every time you were in trouble, I was there.
I came.
tried to save you, help you.
I mean, if that's not love...
I-I don't know what love is, then.
but you kept pushing me away and pushing me away.
and now we're here.
I can't go on like this, Ellie.
I think I've discovered a secret about the most beautiful woman in history.
Kate Upton?
in history, Henry.
I was talking about Cleopatra.
Oh. Fascinating, but I am busy.
I just came to tell you that I had no luck isolating DNA from the shovel Greg and Sara found by the hole.
something in the sample screwed up your extraction, didn't it?
just as Cleopatra and I expected.
fine, I'll bite.
what does my screwed-up sample have to do with Cleopatra?
minerals from the Dead Sea.
13 of them-- not found in water anywhere else in the world.
as usual, I'm not following you.
there was lotion on the shovel handle.
the sample contained a particular proportion of magnesium, bromide, bitumen, calcium and potassium.
the high salt content would explain why my extraction failed.
only one vendor sells a version with the precise mineral proportions that I've identified, and they only offer it online.
I'm waiting for a list of local customers as we speak.
we found a shovel this morning, out in the desert.
it had lotion on the handle, a very specific lotion.
you know the stuff I'm talking about, don't you, Karen?
you were out there.
I think you went out there and dug up Scotty Gates' grave to get to that treasure.
wait, what do you mean,"Scotty's grave"?
we were just looking for the statue.
we?
who'd you go out there with, Karen?
how'd you end up out in the desert with him?
I caught Roger breaking into my father's workshop two nights ago.
he was desperate to get his hands on some photographs.
your dad's aerial photos.
well, why didn't you just call the cops?
I was about to, but then Roger started talking about the treasure.
the stone lion, you know?
he said it wasn't just lore, that it was really worth something.
he thought that with my dad's photos, he could find it.
and he offered to cut you in on the deal.
that's why you decided to help him, hmm?
I figured, why not?
if anybody deserves a piece of that treasure, it's me and my father.
that case ruined our lives.
so the two of you went out there to dig it up, huh?
that was the plan.
but it didn't happen.
we were able to find the spot, pretty much, using the aerial photo.
it's got to be close.
these look like the pipes that are in the picture.
no. No, no. No!
somebody beat us to it.
I need the money.
God, I need the statue!
hey... No!
just get away from me.
go!
I walked away.
that was the last time I saw him--on his knees, crying.
I've known Roger since we were kids.
I would never hurt him.
come here to tell me you talked to Karen?
your daughter was the one who raided your old case files, Sam.
she gave the aerial photos to Roger Mathers.
I can't say I'm surprised.
her whole life, she had to put up with my obsession with the case.
makes sense she'd feel entitled.
Evidentially, she and Roger went out to the desert and they were digging around.
they didn't find anything.
but looks like you did.
the real stone lion is almost 2, 000 years old.
this one isn't even finished yet.
cement?
exact size and weight as the original.
it's a perfect copy of the murder weapon.
come here, I want to show you something. Look at this.
this is a mock-up of the boy's skull, complete with injuries.
so what's your plan?
well, I am going to re-enact the murder, try and duplicate the blow that killed Scotty, prove it's consistent with a killer the same size and frame as Sheriff Combs.
you really think he did it?
well, that's what I want to find out.
not a bad idea.
is that your way of telling me it's a good idea?
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
I do think my guys could, uh, offer a few improvements, if you don't mind joining forces.
so this is just like yours, only we took it a little bit further.
just a little bit.
well, it's for practical reasons more than anything else.
if you were to do the experiment, you'd probably have to destroy about a dozen skulls.
but our head here can sustain numerous blows, and the resulting trauma will be simulated by that computer.
and I assume that, since we know the extent of the trauma, you can set a target zone for the exact force and angle of the impact.
Yes. And that computer will let us know when we perfectly recreate the blow that killed Scotty Gates.
very cool.
what are we waiting for?
the injuries just aren't consistent with the sheriff's height and build.
there's no way the sheriff could've killed Scotty.
well, according to this, the killer was smaller, barely five-feet tall and left-handed.
back when I was a deputy, I used to coach some youth baseball.
there was this one kid, a pitcher, a mean southpaw.
Mr. Briggs?
think we need to have another talk.
I already told you everything I know about Roger.
Yeah, but now you're gonna tell me everything you know about Scotty Gates.
that's where the killing all started 25 years ago.
please, mister, don't shoot us.
we won't tell anyone.
I think he's dead.
that's what you said before.
come on, grab the bags.
wait, wait, wait, wait! What are you doing?
we-we can't.
he's dead. He's not gonna use it.
Yeah, but it's not ours. We have to call the police.
we're not calling anybody. Now, shut up and grab the bags!
no. No, this is stupid. We can't!
don't be a baby!
this is our hideout, and whatever's in it is ours.
now, shut up...and grab the bags.
idiot, you didn't have to break my glasses.
my dad's gonna kill me!
here, now you can buy new glasses.
quit it, Roger. It's not our money.
the cops aren't gonna let us keep it.
we're not telling the cops, stupid. We're not telling anybody.
I told you.
we have to. God, Scotty, stop being such a wuss!
I'm not being a wuss. I'm being smart.
I'm being... normal. There's a dead guy back there.
I'm going home, and I'm calling the cops!
Scotty, I'm warning you.
screw you. You're not the boss of me!
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I just...
I just...
I just snapped.
Yeah, just those... those bags of cash,
it just seemed like all the money in the world.
I just didn't want nobody to take it.
so you killed your best friend.
no. I didn't kill him.
I mean, I hit him.
but he wasn't dead.
Oh, come on, Tyson.
he had a fractured skull.
stop playing these games with me.
tell me what happened out there.
somebody... somebody else was out there that day.
we didn't know we'd been followed.
Hey, guys!
you guys better shut him up.
someone's coming.
damn it, Karen. Why do you always have to follow us?
didn't you hear what I said?
there's a car coming.
damn it!
No!
so, you smothered him?
look, I felt bad.
but in the moment, it was him or all of us.
so, the three of you buried Scotty out in the desert along with that statue?
we were worried someone would find him.
but right away, the focus shifted to Lake Mead, so no one ever did.
what happened to all that money? The cash?
we hid it under the porch at Roger's house.
couple of months later, his grandmother fell asleep on the couch with a cigarette in her hand.
burned the house to the ground.
so, Scotty died for nothing.
we were just kids.
stupid kids.
Yeah, well, you're not a kid anymore, Karen.
know what you are?
you're a liar.
I think you lied to us the last time you came in here.
think that you and Roger found that stone lion the other night, the two of you.
you know what else I think?
I think when you got to the cars...
...something went wrong.
that wasn't the deal, Roger. You said we'd split it 50/50.
I said we'd split it; I didn't say how.
you didn't even know the statue was worth anything until I told you.
and you never would've found it without my father's photos.
I'll cut you in for a finder's fee.
come on, Karen.
what are you gonna do?
you gonna kill me?
like you killed Scotty?
not a bad theory.
problem is, you don't have any evidence.
my father always taught me: no evidence, no case.
that we can get her for Scotty Gates' murder.
she was 11 at the time, and we can't even conclude a cause of death.
we have to get her for killing Roger Mathers.
I know, but we don't have the evidence.
and by the time we do, she will have covered her tracks.
Sam? You looking for me?
when Karen was a teenager, she used to go down to the creek bed behind our house.
she had this little hiding place down there where she'd stash her cigarettes, thinking I-I didn't know.
I took a look down there tonight.
if this is what I think it is, your daughter can go to prison for a long time.
same caliber that killed Roger Mathers.
all for this.
you know, for years, I wondered if that thing really existed.
now, more than ever, I wish it hadn't.
I thought I knew my little girl.
I thought we had no secrets.
for 25 years, she'd been hiding the truth from me.
I don't understand it.
I just...
I'm sorry. I really am.
you do everything you can for your kid.
you-you give them everything.
everything.
including the power to break your heart.
captain, you wanted to know if there was news.
Yeah.
the swelling in Ellie's brain has subsided enough that we've reduced the medication.
she is responsive now.
she's awake? Yes.
but still in recovery.
I understand. Thank you, Doctor.
they told me you were hovering.
Yeah.
I just want to, uh, make sure that you were...
all right?
we both know that that's not really possible.
why'd you even come?
I guess I'm...
just not ready to...
give up on you, Ellie.
this is not your fault.
there's always been something wrong with me.
you should just let me go.
I've tried.
believe me.
but I can't.
I mean...
you're all I have left.
look, I'm going to, uh...
I'm gonna let you rest, let you sleep, okay?
no. Stay.
please, Dad?
Hey, Jim.
D. B.come in. Sit down.
I hear Ellie's out of the woods.
Yeah.
two of you able to talk?
Yeah, we did.
for a while.
you all right?
I am, actually.
can I buy you a drink?
Yeah.
here you go.
happy days.
happy day.
you're a little calmer than I thought you might be.
you sure you're all right?
Yeah, I just had a four-hour conversation with my daughter.
that's something that hasn't happened to me in 15 years.
we realize that we need each other.
even more now.
I-I would be a little...little bit cautious if I were you.
"Cautious"? What do you mean?
you think she's trying to manipulate me-- is that it?
I love her, D.B.
I have to trust her.
she's all I got.
and I want to be there for her, I mean, really be there.
help her out, the way any father would.
good for you.
and I hope it works out. I really do.
well, you and me both.
and with a little luck, who knows?
okay.
I think I'm gonna hit the road.
okay.
Yeah.
want to walk out with me?
no, I think I'm gonna hang out here for a while.
I got to figure some things out.
okay.
《 Bodies in Motion 》
Warrick, why don't you and I take the perimeter and work our way in.
all right.
Greg, you're with us. I'll start the sketch.
how you doing, Nick? - Above ground, Wilcox.
would you like inside or out?
I'll take in.
we got two vics.
we think the girl is Selena March.
she owns the trailer.
what about the male?
nothing yet.
this is a piece of the roof right here
fiberglass and particle board.
these things weren't built to last.
they were built to burn.
this place is totaled.
my money's on meth lab. The bed's collapsed.
you know, Metcalf, just because somebody lives in a trailer park, doesn't mean they're a meth cook.
you guys are a real pain in the ass, you know that?
get used to it, pal.
I'm just having a little trouble understanding this because you...
...all live so close together. You mean none of you saw the explosion?
uh, I heard it. - Well, good.
when I came out about five minutes later, the whole place was burnin' up.
where do you live? - Right over there.
all right, let me get this straight
you heard a blast like that coming from your neighbor's and it took...
...you five minutes to poke your head out and see what was going on?
I was watching TV. - I'm sure he was drinking.
no, hang around, hang around. Hey, hang around.
did you find a man in Selena's trailer?
now why would you ask that? Was Selena a hooker?
I'm sure I don't know.
but one thing I do know, that's not Selena's car.
yeah?
Catherine, we have a 4-19 off Industrial.
do you mind handling it?
so you get the team back together only to break us apart again.
what kind of a pervert game are you playing here, Gil?
same one as usual. - Yeah, I'll cover it. I'm taking Warrick.
Oh, hey, guys. Good to see you.
Hey, would you tell Nick
I hope there's no hard feelings about that whole, you know, abduction thing. He hasn't returned my calls.
he's been busy.
squad car found her about a half hour ago-- no ID, but there's a lot of homeless in this area.
looks like somebody took something to her head.
didn't find a weapon, but my guys are still looking.
a shopping bag for a shirt, rubber boots and a G-string.
homeless stripper?
well, this is G-String Row, isn't it?
why is there a ring on your ring finger?
because I'm married.
what?
Congratulations.
how much did you pay her?
no, seriously, good luck with that, man. I didn't even know you had a girlfriend.
Oh, yeah, it's a girl I've been dating a couple months, Tina.
how long have you been married?
since yesterday.
did this, uh, drive-through wedding at Circus Way, you know. Fun, fun time.
Hey. Sorry I'm late. Busy night.
we need a TOD, David.
Rigor's barely set, so not long. Under four hours.
about as long as Warrick's been married.
you're married?
Congratulations. - Thanks.
do you think she was dumped?
lividity is consistent with the position of the body.
so it's highly unlikely. - All right.
I'll check out the strip clubs. - I'll go with you.
well, there doesn't seem to be any drug-manufacturing supplies, but plenty of ignition sources: a hot plate, fondue pot, gas stove, candles.
one leaky pipe's all it takes.
which I haven't found yet.
Yeah, but even if you had, that would only explain the explosion in here, not the ruptured gas main outside.
think I can help you with that.
I found this gas meter over by the main.
trailer blows, this thing becomes a missile.
one explosion leads to another.
Yeah, but where did it all start?
brass ran the plates on that Acura near the trailer.
it's registered to a Robert Durgee.
you get his photo from the DMV?
confirmed as the vic-- Henderson address, mortgage broker.
wife's name was on the insurance card.
she coming in? - She wasn't home.
brass is tracking her down.
excuse me, Mr. Grissom...
an officer brought this in off a call from Flora Nevada Nursery.
they thought it might have something to do with the Walter Gordon case.
female's lungs were filled with soot.
cod is smoke inhalation.
okay, that means the natural gas didn't suffocate her.
explosion probably knocked her out before the fire even started.
Yeah, male didn't even last that long.
his lungs were clean, but he suffered fatal crushing injuries to his abdomen.
the pieces of debris that were on this guy's body were not heavy.
but the bed he was lying in collapsed. - Explosion could've done that.
let's photo-enhance these bruises.
Yeah, yeah, the UV light's definitely bringing out the bruises underneath the skin.
that looks like a tire mark.
maybe our gas explosion just turned into a hit-and-run.
well, Robert said that he was going to be working late.
so I ...went to midnight bingo.
alone?
excuse me?
alone?
I was...
with a friend.
what was your friend's name?
Why?
why not?
he's married.
looks like the only person in this thing who isn't married...
...is the dead girl in the trailer with your husband.
you didn't know he was having an affair?
no, I had no idea.
you have a '96 blue Ford Ranger.
we're going to need to take a look at it.
but my truck is in New Mexico.
my brother borrowed it this morning, he, uh...
a wild guess: you have no idea how to reach him.
not until he gets back.
why do you need to see my truck?
let me tell you a story.
once upon a time, you follow your husband to a trailer park.
you see him slumming with his little trailer bunny.
you waited for him to come out...
when she pulls the body back in, before she can call for help, you torch the place. Kaboom.
the end.
that is the craziest thing I've ever heard.
wouldn't even make my top ten.
so that's when the bereaved Mrs. Durgee lawyered up.
Broadcast's out on her truck, and the warrant's ready to go.
I don't care what he says.
put him in the tank and see if he wises up.
sure as hell can't get any dumber.
detective Curtis.
Grissom.
I thought you were supposed to be arresting people in Boulder City.
well, a spot opened up here and... I transferred in today.
surprise.
well, your mother would be proud.
my mother made Captain.
you know, I'd just qualified for my shield when the sheriff...
...pulled my papers and "volunteered" me to CSI.
I think my mom hated that more than I did.
you won't miss the lab, will you?
there's some things I'll miss.
I'll see you around.
so, Vartann and I struck out on G-String Row.
you poor guys.
Yeah, right.
you know what I mean. No one recognized the victim's picture.
listen, Cath, about this whole - marriage thing... - Yeah, that.
Yeah, that kind of threw me for a loop.
Tina, right?
Yeah.
she must be a very special woman. I look forward to meeting her.
Yes, she... - The vic's blood-alcohol level was 0.16
and COD was blunt-force trauma.
smashed and then smashed, huh?
any luck on the, uh... victim's prints?
no work card, no record.
but the rubber boots were standard-issue Streets and Sanitation.
Yeah, there's three S&S workers with those initials.
and it looks like an Eddie Vonner was on duty last night.
why would you want to see my boots?
you tell us.
look, I know it's against the regs to pick...up anything other than trash, but, I mean, come on.
she was barefoot; she was stepping on glass and crap, so, yeah, I gave her my boots. And she practically begged, so,
I gave her a lift.
so, you're just a good Samaritan.
Oh, come on, it was pretty obvious she didn't belong there.
where? - Jefferson and K?
you ever see the citizens that hang out in that neighborhood?
when I see them, they're usually dead.
well, there you go.
I mean, come on, she... I could tell, despite the...
well, the get-up, she was hot.
and, I mean, I'm not talking like garbage truck hot.
I mean, she was like... like limo hot.
listen, did she tell you her name, or, uh, how she ended up there, anything?
she looked kind of embarrassed, so I didn't push it.
so, I just... I dropped her off down at, uh,
WESTERN and Industrial. Never left my route.
why, did she, uh...? She say anything about me?
she died a few blocks from where you dropped her off.
if the wife torched the trailer and caused the explosion, you would expect to see small debris embedded all over the inside of these walls.
there's nothing here.
Hey, hey... Sara.
check this out.
this is a piece of the exterior wall facing the road.
with a tire mark on it? - Yeah.
there is blue paint on this gas main.
didn't mean anything at the time.
amber has a blue Ford Ranger, right?
what if Amber follows her husband to trailer, sees him go inside, totally freaks out.
why wait for him to come out?
Yeah. Yeah, just come straight through. Run him over in bed with another chick.
trailer collapses, fire breaks out, sweeps through, and destroys practically all evidence of a collision.
it's too bad we don't have her truck.
we could match this to her tires.
Well,'96 Ford Ranger, stock paint.
maybe I can match the transfer to this.
I'm starving.
there's a uni going out for sandwiches. Would you like me to get you something?
no, no, you go ahead. I'm gonna work on this.
according to the garbageman, she ran up from this direction.
yeah? - Must be where she got the bag.
victim wasn't carrying a cell phone.
she's in the wrong part of town in her underwear, scared out of her head.
she's gonna call her man, her family, someone.
and she didn't have a quarter, so she called 911.
I'll print the phones. - I'll dump the call records.
let's get the traffic cameras, too.
the, uh, tread mark on your trailer wall...is consistent with Michelin 195/70/R14s.
what about the blue paint scrapings we found on the gas main?
you got a real thing for blue paint. You know that?
but, uh, this isn't from a Ford Ranger, or any Ford for that matter.
it's a GMC paint.
amber Durgee was cheating on her husband, maybe even wanted him dead, but her truck didn't have anything to do with it.
right tires, wrong vehicle.
found something?
part of a headlamp, maybe.
well, I found some blue paint transfer on that chain-link fence.
as far as tracks go, this place is a parking lot, man. They're everywhere.
except between the gas main and the trailer.
so, the trailer wasn't rammed?
I think we're looking at the, uh, vehicle equivalent of a through-and-through.
car comes down the road.
gas main ...
flying car.
that's what we're gonna go with? - Okay.
the partial oem number on the headlamp piece - belongs to a'97 pontiac sunfire. - Boy, that was quick.
well, gmc paint-- tire model wasn't that tough.
I'll put out another broadcast. - All right.
your broadcast was for a blue Pontiac. Patrol figured this was worth a look.
how bad does a smell have to get before Parking Control calls Homicide?
no way this car was at the trailer park. Think we've got a new case.
first citation was issued five days ago.
car's probably been here at least six. - Six days in the summer heat.
and a trunk becomes a Crockpot.
looks like a male and a female.
that could be an entry wound in her skull.
well, if she was shot in there, there might be bullets and casing.
I say we process the car in place. Let's get rolling.
area is uncontrolled. Evidence can be contaminated or lost.
we need to get this back to the lab.
car condom.
Hi, CSI guy.
you're wondering why you're here?
because you followed the evidence. - Archie? Archie?
do you have anything on pay phone dump? - Oh. Yeah.
the 911 call about five minutes before your garbageman picked up the vic.
then I matched timecodes with the video from the traffic cam.
synched up the audio.
911. What is your emergency? - Whoa!
that's our girl.
will you tell me your location? --No. I don't know where I am, okay?!
someone's getting territorial.
vic loses her shoes. Explains the boots. Let see where she came from.
rewind it a little bit,
Oh, Stop. Hold it.
that looks like an airport shuttle.
there's a logo on this side. - Yeah. I can enhance that.
that's a limo? - This is Vegas.
it's a strip bar on wheels.
I don't even pay attention to the talent.
I just drive down Industrial Boulevard, from strip club to strip club, picking 'em up.
it's like bus stops. Before you know it, we're full, the bus is on fire...
we call it the "Champagne Ride." It's nice.
so what do the girls get paid for this?
the girls, they make at least twice as much as they do in the clubs.
depending on what else they ride.
it's a pretty sweet deal for the guys.
hot chicks getting trashed with no security and nowhere to go.
and what happens when the girls want to get off?
usually, it's the guys that are getting off.
I found something in there besides body fluids.
belongs to the victim, Brooke Harris.
you dropped that girl off in a war zone, man.
when the guy paying the tab says he wants to stop, I just stop.
come on... - Stop it!
back off, jerk! - Stop the bus!
get her off the bus! - No, I don't want...
look, strippers are tough chicks, okay?
I figured she'd find a way home, one way or another.
Brooke Harris was getting calls from a gym?
well, the "Giselle" number went straight to voice mail.
the voice mail said to contact her here.
and what's the word on the husband?
the husband. - Yeah... no, according to his office, he's away in Laughlin on business. We're still trying to get in touch...
swing those legs up and around. Yeah, like a waterfall...
you got it. That's it!
so I called Brooke a few times.
so what? She was one of my students.
you actually teach this?
strippers have the best bodies in town.
if you want the body, this is how you get it.
trust me, I've been doing this since before I had my driver's license.
well, workout is one thing.
what is a housewife from Centennial Park doing on a stripper bus with pros?
she wanted it.
come on... - No, really. She loved the attention.
loved the fantasy. She wanted to try it for real.
see how she stacked up against some real talent.
and you let her - Do I look like her mother?
you were teaching her a lesson.
if I'd wanted to do that,
I would've sent her to Stripperama, fed her to the wolves.
and drunk CEOs aren't wolves?
they're worse. You know that.
that's why you kept calling her.
so you could hear all about it, right?
I was just calling to see how things went.
Oh, really?
it's starting to sound like I need a lawyer.
so I pulled all the ROs from all the '97 blue Sunfires in Nevada, one name and address just jumped out...
Randy Swansiger.
Las Vegas Police!
come on out, Randy.
walk out slowly Randy
michelin tires.
blue car.
broken headlamp.
Hey, how's it goin'?
I'm Detective Jim Brass. Remember me?
what are you guys doing?
you got a couple of DWIs on your record.
what have you got to say for yourself, Randy?
I was coming home...
been working late...
I guess I fell asleep at the wheel...
next thing I know...
crash-boom-bang!
the car still worked, so...
drain plug's probably under the carpet.
I think I found it.
technically, that makes you a cannibal.
Grissom would be proud.
Grissom would've tasted it on purpose.
it's working.
that makes 34 prints.
Jacqui's going to love me.
you got something?
I think so...
bullet fragment.
Copper-jacketed.
rules out a 0.22.
see, it was worth it.
you better get ready for this because this is going to blow you away.
the rust-colored material you found on the victim's head wound... was rust.
plain old ferric oxide, found on nearly every iron object on the planet Earth.
case breaker?
no?
as they say, "garbage in, garbage out."
um... the Champagne Ride picks up strippers...
...near the clubs, but not actually at the clubs.
right. The owners don't like that bus coming anywhere near the clubs...
...because they don't make any money off them.
well, look,
Brooke Harris wasn't planning to die that night.
she had to have parked her car somewhere.
well, there's a secured parking lot not too far from where the garbageman dropped her off.
so, if she parked her car here...
why did she go here?
Hey, Catherine...
yes?
can we talk? About this?
sure.
you know, what happened to Nick...
it just got me thinking.
life is so short, you know?
it's almost...
it's almost shorter than we want to ever believe.
live for the day. - Exactly.
so, I,uh...
I've been heading to ask this young lady
I've been seeing, Tina, to marry me.
you know that I'm happy for you. - Yeah?
Yeah.
but it also feels like you're not so happy for me.
Warrick...
you know, the thing that makes a fantasy great is the possibility that it might come true.
and when you lose that possibility...
it just kind of sucks.
okay, Mr. Greg, your most likely match is a 0.44 round recovered from a drug-related shoot-out in Mesquite five days ago. Case is still open.
that's roughly two days after the bodies ended up in the trunk.
maybe our vics were the beginning of a little crime spree.
Thanks.
I ran the Grand Am's VIN. Last RO was a tow yard over by Nellis.
vehicle's most likely an impound, sold under the table to some scammer who faked his tags.
you're not going to get far in that direction - I know.
what about prints? --13 different IDs.
some off work cards, some off felonies ranging from assault, B&E, cocaine trafficking.
well, even if I do manage to track them all down, there's no guarantee any of these were involved with the vics.
well, they didn't put themselves in the trunk, and unless they were shot right there at the curb, somebody drove the car there. You're the detective.
go detect.
fully developed skeletal structure consistent with an adult male.
the medial end of the clavicle's almost fused.
suggests he's about 25 years old.
lack of prognathism indicates he's Caucasian.
the female, however, is prognathic...
and that suggests Negroid.
unfused epiphysial ends make her a teenager.
white male, younger black female... racially motivated?
could be a Son of Sam thing.
summertime, couple on a date, making out in the car.
berkowitz used a 0. 44.
gunshot wounds are most likely COD for both.
female shows an entry wound at the rear of the skull.
exit wound took off most of her face.
male has no exit wound, but the entry wound...
is pretty obvious.
bullet never left the skull.
that would explain the bullet fragments.
what we need are IDs.
no missing persons filed for Caucasian males...
...between 20 and 30 in the last two weeks, but there are possibles for the girl.
two cases still open.
13 seems a little young.
could be a kidnapping.
the other one's 16.
this is one time it would be better to stay missing.
this one's from her doctor.
other's from her dentist.
how long is it going to take you?
that's hard to say.
Mr. James, was Clara by any chance seeing an older man?
as far as I know, she wasn't seeing anybody but it wouldn't surprise me if she was.
Clara wasn't smart when it come to people, talking to any lowlife chump who'd give her the time of day.
the girl never did listen to a damn word I said.
the older man...
um... could've been someone she met at school?
did she have a part-time job?
Gooeybunz, over on El Dorado.
we found a number of half-eaten Gooeybunz in the car.
you know, Clara wasn't really that smart about her diet either, but she hated those things.
Smell'd get into her clothes.
by the time she got home, she practically ready to throw up.
you find out who did this...
you let me know. - Yeah.
according to Clara James' father,
Clara didn't eat Gooeybunz.
she didn't like them, which means it was either the killer or the male DB.
so we're looking for...
bite marks?
if we find a good impression, maybe we'll get an ID through dental records.
you got it.
and the student becomes a master.
I'm not seeing any bite marks.
me either.
it's not like they were bitten at all. More like torn apart.
check it out.
they might all be in pieces...
but they're all still here.
no one ever ate any of them.
which is kinda weird. I mean, why...buy all of 'em and not eat 'em?
I found this one under a passenger seat
intact, on the floor.
it escaped the carnage.
that's not frosting.
I always liked the middle part the best.
when she parks her car, she's a hot housewife.
a few hours later, she's just another freak.
it's my Mercedes, okay? I can prove it. Just give me the keys.
show me ten bucks or you ain't proving squat. - I don't have anywhere to go!
Brooke Harris probably spent ten bucks a day...on nonfat lattes. - Right.
she needed money to get her car back.
well, I don't see any ATMs around here.
this is a bad place to be broke.
Hey, you miss me?
rusty flakes.
Hey, Michaels, did you put this crime tape up?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, well, you missed something. There's blood on this rebar.
Where'd you find that?
I, uh... I just picked it up over there...
may I ask you a question?
do you recognize this woman?
she's a thief.
she took some money out of my hat.
Hey! Hey!
stealing's a crime.
Hey, Michaels.
think you might be able to take this man into custody?
tox confirmed that the packet in the Gooeybun contained cocaine, and one of the prints that I lifted off the Grand
am was a felony conviction for cocaine trafficking
Joey Zack, drug dealer.
seems he liked to use Gooeybunz to move his coke.
he's a nice regular customer at Gooeybunz.
he used to chat up cute Clara when he was there, sweet-talks her into a date, and they both end up dead in his bitchin' Grand Am.
well, whoever did it must've done it for the drugs.
GCMS on the melted gloves from your Grand Am.
a delicious confection of sugar, gelatin, starches, citric acid, mineral oil,
red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 1 and carnauba wax,
candy.
gummy candy.
I'm partial to Jujubes myself. Is it something I said?
probably. - Joey Zack's print was found on the radio, which was tuned to 107 FM.
now, as far as I know, there is only one place in town where you can get gummies, a generic cheese burger, and 107. 1 gets anything other than static.
sorry, I don't recognize him.
most of the time when people come here, it's dark.
how about this? You ever seen this car before?
no, all I remember from the last two weeks is what's playing 'cause I've seen it 8, 000 times.
killer Punch. A big draw for crap cars.
we're gonna need to talk to your employees.
Oh, come on, please. Is that really necessary?
it's a homicide investigation.
we could just call the health inspector and...
see how many code violations he has festering in that concession stand.
geez, fine, knock yourselves out.
Jerry's on tickets...
Maddox runs the projector, and Darryl's in concessions.
no. No, he quit last week. - Why?
he said he was gonna go live with his parents up in Mesquite.
guy's name is Darryl Blakeny.
small-time hood with priors for B&E and possession.
his prints were on the steering wheel of the Grand Am.
when he quit his job at the drive-in, he was in court-ordered rehab.
we figured Blakeny was one of Joey Zack's customers.
one night,
Blakeny sees his coke dealer's Grand Am at the drive-in, and the fiend snaps.
move, and you're dead! Shut up!
all right, all right, all right! - Give me the coke, Joey!
give me the coke!
do we know where he killed them?
we don't know where yet.
or why.
maybe the girl started freaking out;
maybe Blakeny's just a psycho.
anyway, uh, Blakeny tossed the bodies, and throws them in the trunk and drives home.
the street where the Grand Am was found is a block away from his last known residence.
he leaves it there collecting parking tickets, skips town, and uses the same gun two days later...
... in another drug-related crime in Mesquite.
the scumbag's still in the wind.
at least he's in the system with a double homicide.
that's not going to satisfy Clara James' father.
can she cook? Is she a good cook?
come on, Warrick. - Hey, Grissom.
we're taking Warrick to the Pepper Mill to celebrate his marriage and to condemn his elopement. You in?
did you invite your wife?
I don't think I'm ready to subject her to the crew just yet.
I got to beg off, you guys.
got to take Lindsay to school. - All right.
so? - I got one more thing to do.
all right. Don't.
so, breathe quick. Breathe slow.
put your gun in your mouth and pull the trigger.
any way you like, you're going to die here.
okay? Perfect.
okay? Perfect.
how'd you know it was going to be there?
if that "okay" had been meant for Nick, it wouldn't have been in the form of a question.
I think maybe Walter Gordon had an accomplice.
perfect.
male or female?
it's, um...
hard to say. The tape was pretty mangled.
enhancement and noise cancellation increase intelligibility, but it alters timber and tone.
I don't know there's any more I can do here.
you know, Nick recorded a message on the flip side of the tape.
you think maybe we should... - No.
this is between you and me.
Hey! Where's my money?
you wait here!
man: You want to come with us?
Oh, my God.
come on.
gunshot wound to the neck.
no visible GSR.
money on the visor.
it wasn't a robbery.
dirt clods on the floor mat look undisturbed.
could be from the last fare.
I don't see any shell casings, though.
partition's closed.
bullet-proof glass.
he was not shot from inside.
well, I got two bullet holes in the passenger door.
that's a weird side of the car for a drive by.
maybe he wasn't shot here.
maybe he just ended up here.
grissom: Excuse me?
are you with the Transit Board?
Yeah.
do you have the dispatch log?
Thanks.
Why's he leaving?
well, that's kind of what he does.
is this camera always on?
man: Only on HBO.
it takes stills for ten seconds when the door opens, and then for the first ten seconds of the fare.
we're gonna need the pictures.
it's Gil.
how you doing?
I'm busy.
checking up on me?
why would I need to do that?
you tell me.
look, I know you tend to get a little territorial about your crime scenes, and I don't want there to be any tension between us, so I'm giving you fair warning.
fair warning for what?
you're at 7888 Oakey Street, am I right?
if it weren't for the cyanosis,
I'd say he was doing a photo shoot for GQ.
Yeah, I'm sure he wasn't ready for this photo shoot.
robbins: Body temp's 95.
that would make T. O.D. approximately 3: 00 a. m.
brown: Well, there's plenty of drugs around here.
you think he OD'd?
Yeah, no edema.
some petechias.
could be suffocation or strangulation.
but no ligature marks or bruising.
however...
...some fibers under the chin.
brown: What are you doing?
it's for my scrapbook.
I've got a perfect spot for him
a place of honor between Tupac and Entwhistle.
grissom: The taxi's last drop off was this address.
this guy's got dirt on his shoes and pants.
there was dirt in the cab.
he's got to be the last fare.
so, somebody killed them both.
and if it's about money, doesn't look like this guy has much.
well, I guess it's relative.
it depends on 15527 East Charleston Road.
that's a long way from here.
grissom: I count six shots in his chest.
there were two in the cab, one in the cabbie.
if the math is correct, that's nine.
suggests semi-automatic, but I don't see any shell casings here.
Yeah, there were none in the taxi, either.
killer could have picked them up.
to shoot a guy six times in the torso, you either have to be very close, or a hell of a shot.
it's okay if I roll him? Yeah.
PHILLIPS: Well, no through and through.
we should be able to recover some bullets from the body.
hang on.
what do you make of that?
looks like he rubbed up against something.
there's some paint flaked off of that railing.
we got blood drops.
this looks fresh.
Las Vegas Police! Put the gun down!
put the gun down!
put it down.
I shoot... burglar!
wasn't he supposed to be like, uh...
the next Brad Pitt or something?
Yeah. Now he's the next River Phoenix.
curtis: All right, Gerald.
uh, they call me Blinky.
and what was your relation to Julian Harper?
best friends since kindergarten.
now I work for him.
what did you do for him?
pretty much everything.
you know, bought his stuff, hooked him up.
drove him to meetings.
did you find the body?
I ordered room service.
I wanted to see if he was hungry.
boom, there he was.
did you touch or move the body in any way?
uh, no way. No.
I watch those murder shows, you know?
I know to just keep my hands to myself, and, uh, call the cops.
what is with the robe?
did you pat him down?
he's packing a small, friendly weapon.
would you mind standing up for us, sir?
Nah, bro, I - I - I...
kind of got the angle of the dangle going.
the boing, boing, boing.
curtis: Stand up.
I, uh, took a Prevalis on the plane over.
I been pitching a tent for, like, eight hours.
Yeah, I - I think I need to consult a physician.
it's called a priapism.
just in case you were wondering.
what else are you on, man?
Oh, uh, nothing.
I mean, uh, I smoked a little herb at the club, but that's it.
what about Julian?
Oh, Jules? Oh, no, he, uh... he won't even take aspirin.
you know, he's organic.
you know, treats his body like a temple.
well, we're gonna need a list of everyone who was here worshipping the temple.
can I sit down?
Yeah.
did someone turn a shower on or something?
you cleared that room, right?
are you okay?
Hey.
we need a medic!
and a bag for stomach contents.
his name is Keo Vipraxay.
he barely speaks English.
he's South Asian, I think.
anyway, it's all clear.
Thanks, Jim.
Double-aught buck.
standard shot is nine pellets.
that would account for all the hits.
so you're saying that a single shotgun blast, through a security door, took out two separate victims in two separate locations?
weird, huh?
grissom: The cab drops Samay Thao in front of this building.
and the position of the blood drops give us a pretty good idea of where Samay was standing when he was shot.
he was a little shorter than me.
shots were centered on his chest, about there.
grissom: My guess is, the cab was parked down there the driver peeled out when he got shot.
vertical deflection down to the cab is roughly 60 degrees.
standard shot won't spread that far.
the pellets must have come through the screen.
the old billiard ball effect.
the cab driver was collateral damage.
okay, but the man with the shotgun said he shot a burglar.
what's here to steal?
stokes: Semen on the bed sheets, as well as every other flat surface in here.
brown: Yeah.
I've got vodka, champagne, cocaine...
stokes: Hey, hey.
pantyhose.
I've got some smudges over here.
I've got some footprints.
looks like someone was standing right there.
was this guy just doing it all over the hotel room?
if those are his footprints...
where are hers?
or her feet were up... in the air.
you tell me-- you just had your honeymoon.
you want to swab this?
I just don't understand.
I mean, who would want to kill Julian?
I mean, he'd had some weird fan mail, but I don't think any of those kinds of people would be able to get in his suite. Were you in his suite?
the ex-wife isn't exactly the best person to have around when you're looking to get laid.
was that your choice or his?
it was mutual.
I'm strictly his manager now.
so if you weren't in his suite, where did you go?
I was taking care of business.
: checked the boys in, made sure the suite was copasetic, had a drink at Skin, and played pai gow until hotel security came to get me.
so how did you get to be his manager?
when I was with him, he was broke.
then after the divorce, I still... did his laundry, paid his bills, read his scripts.
after a while, I wanted to get paid.
now I get ten percent of everything.
look...
I need to make some calls.
Julian's parents, the studio...
can we talk about this later?
sure. But I need your prints and your DNA now.
tox shows low levels of cocaine, alcohol and Prevalis.
rules out overdose.
Really? I guess he was just acting about the clean-living part.
C. O.D?
asphyxia. Asphyxiated how?
I don't know.
no broken hyoid.
that and the absence of ligature marks or bruises make strangulation unlikely.
did you find any fibers in his nose or mouth?
Nope.
that doesn't rule out suffocation.
killer could have used something that didn't shed fibers.
or maybe they came from whoever he was rolling around with in bed.
found, uh, lubricant on his genitals, probably from a condom, and minor abrasions on his penis, indicative of vigorous, prolonged activity.
sex, drugs and movies: the American dream.
your stomach contents contain alcohol and traces of triazolam.
Try-as-a-what?
it's a sleeping pill, has you reading the inside of your eyelids for a week. I didn't take any pills.
we also found cocaine in your bloodstream.
I guess you didn't take that, either?
so I did a couple of lines, but I didn't take any pills.
if I was gonna take a pill,
I would've popped E or a perc.
curtis: Miss Villa, we found you in Julian Harper's suite.
were you ever in his bedroom?
: who knows?
I don't even know how I ended up in Blinky's room.
Oh, my...
I swear, if that guy slipped me something...
tell us what you do remember.
me and my girls were at Skin, and, uh...
blinky came over and said he was partying with Julian Harper.
and he said they had this pimpy booth, so we went over.
it didn't turn out the way I hoped.
and the next thing I know, Blinky's on top of me.
we could assist you in reporting a date rape.
Thanks, but no.
it's not an offer, it's our job.
there's this Stuff magazine party at Ghost Bar tonight.
I'm not gonna make it harder for me to get in because I tattled on Julian Harper's best friend.
I mean, if I run into them tonight...
Julian Harper will not be there.
trust me, he will.
the coroner finished the autopsy early this morning.
he's dead?
curtis: Yeah.
I was in Julian Harper's suite when he died?
you're kidding me, right?
and being in his suite makes you a suspect.
I am? Yes.
so we're going to need to take a sample of your DNA.
Oh, man.
I am so getting into that party tonight for sure.
Yeah, I remember that guy.
he's, like, Chinese or something, real spun out.
he was on meth?
well, he was on something.
he was acting all shady.
downed a bottle of soda before he even paid for it.
and that's how you knew he was on something?
there ain't nothin' out here.
people here act messed up because they are messed up.
the Metro Transit Board said that he caught a Sunstar Taxi from this address.
I called it for him.
anything to get that tweaker out of here.
any idea how he got here in the first place?
all I saw him do was walk through the door.
I don't even need to open him up to guess C. O.D.
ocular inflammation.
laceration of the sclera.
hurts like hell when you get a grain of sand in your eye.
imagine this.
bad night for Laotians.
what other Laotians are having a bad night?
robbins: Solo traffic collision on Mount Charleston.
came in early this morning.
well, that's a hell of a coincidence.
does it mean something to you?
Yeah, he's got the same last name as the guy who shot him. In fact,
Grissom said that our vic over there caught a cab at a gas station near Mount Charleston.
I'll have auto detail bring in his car.
sounds like your double's becoming a triple.
unless you got any more in your drawers?
see if you can help me out.
there was a smear on the window at the hotel.
it came back saliva.
so I ran it through CODIS, got a hit, felony battery on this guy, Willie Angel.
now, he's a Las Vegas resident, but he wasn't a registered guest at the hotel.
he has no affiliation with Julian's little entourage whatsoever.
I think I scoped this guy earlier.
Really? Yeah.
do it up.
Yeah, there he is.
: looking dapper.
all right.
12: 31 a. m.
gets off on the high-roller floor.
Hey, 2: 45 a. m.
stokes: Shopping bags?
there's no mall on that floor.
he was shopping at Julian Harper's.
enough time to shop and kill.
the Palms issued two card keys
one to Julian, and one to his boy Blinky.
but the database shows...
one, two... three keys were used to access the suite?
well, assuming the third card was Willie's.
you can't just walk up to the front desk and pull the "I lost my key" scam on a VIP suite.
so...
how'd Willie get it?
sorry.
I just started seeing someone. Had a bit of a late night.
let me ask you something.
how do you know when it's gone from just friends to more than?
well, if you have to ask...
it's just friends.
she is making dinner for me this weekend.
are you the only guest?
do her roommates count?
the splinter from your vic's eye has four distinct layers.
polycarbonate plastic, aluminum, acrylic and dye.
being an audiophile, I prefer the sound of vinyl.
it's from a compact disc?
well, how did it end up in Samay Thao's eye?
noy Vipraxay's car.
easy for you to say.
find anything?
take a look at this.
gravitational pooling directly under the steering wheel.
Willows: The car was found at the bottom of a steep incline.
so he was leaning over it when he bled out.
except he wasn't.
take a look. These were taken at the crash site.
if he'd have bled out in the position he was found, there'd be blood on the door, not under the steering wheel.
so someone moved the body?
there was plenty of mud at the scene, and Samay had mud on his pants.
maybe we can match soil samples.
hang on.
trace came back on the splinter that was in Samay's eye.
it was a CD fragment.
Samay was in this car.
sidle: Hey, guys.
I got work card hits off prints from the two dead Laotians and the shooter.
we already know their IDs.
well, did you already know that they all worked together?
so Samay Thao worked for you?
Yeah, runs the dryers.
when was the last time you saw him?
he's been off a couple days now.
did you know, uh, Noy or Keo Vipraxay?
sure. They work here, too.
they brothers or cousins, or what?
brothers. Keo's older.
I hear they got six more back in Laos.
they work swing-- they're on at 4: 00.
were they friends of Samay's?
No! No way.
keo and Noy are Lao Loum.
they're lowlanders.
Samay's Hmong; he's in the hills.
they're born to hate each other. Some tribal crap.
what kind of trouble are they in?
the kind where you stop breathing.
Noy's dead-- car accident.
Samay's dead, too-- Keo shot him.
you speak Lao?
and Thai, Vietnamese, Tagalog.
I pulled a stint straight out of high school.
I got Southeast Asia, lucky me.
Yeah, I know how you feel.
did Keo tell you what happened?
I mean, his English isn't very good.
no, we're, uh, we're still waiting on an interpreter.
if you need any help, you let me know.
Yeah, maybe... maybe I'll take you up on that.
you can't fool the eye in the sky, Willie.
there's a lot of people looking for you.
okay, you got me.
what do you want?
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, you can't do that.
Oh, this here says we can.
ho - ho - ho! Slick Willie.
look out now.
you collect card keys, Willie?
I won at those places. Really?
I hang on to them for good luck. Well, I bet you're real lucky with this cheap magnetic stripe reader and palm top, huh?
you know you can get into most hotel rooms in the city with this thing?
you take the old card key, you input the room number, a little magnetic encoding...
and Bob's your uncle.
you used the card to open the door.
you get into his suite and hide.
Julian comes back, drops his wallet and takes off his watch.
he falls asleep.
you rob him blind.
but he wakes up.
so it's kill him or go back to jail.
what the...? Who the hell are you?
stop, okay?
stop.
I was in his suite.
and, yeah, I'm a thief.
but I didn't kill anybody.
you were in his suite for over two hours, man.
that's more than enough time to snag a couple shopping bags.
cause that sick, rich freak wasn't going to sleep.
he was banging some blonde for, like, two hours.
talk to her.
we're talking to you.
I don't know what the hell they were doing, but when she left, he wasn't moving.
I thought he was asleep.
then I saw the news this morning.
if it's a killer you're looking for, talk to the girl in the red dress.
we believe that Samay Thao killed your brother and tried to make it look like an accident.
did you know about it?
he says he thought Samay was there to rob him.
that's why he shot him.
johnson: The girl in the red dress gets off with Julian's entourage at 12: 57.
then gets back on at 2: 33.
certainly looks like she's been through something rough.
she forgot her pantyhose.
stokes: Good eyes.
great legs.
been a while, Arch?
can you follow her out?
Yeah. I just got this footage...
sanders: Hey, I heard you guys are having trouble with the Julian Harper case.
who'd you hear that from? Ecklie. He's putting me on it.
man, you gotta quit kissing his ass.
all right, fellas, check this out.
okay, that's Julian's manager.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.
that's got to be at least a few Gs.
she a hooker?
I don't know, I think she could be the killer.
solicitation murder?
manager pays to have her client whacked.
she went to the shopping arcade.
wait a minute.
what kind of hired killer takes their payoff and goes to the mall?
johnson: I don't know.
this one put herself on a mailing list.
tally Jordan. There's the phone number.
you call my cell, I answer, we talk.
and then you guys show up and arrest me at the pool, in front of my friends. Is that fair?
you left Julian Harper's room at 2: 33.
a couple of minutes later, you're taking money from his manager.
I'm not a prostitute.
couple hours later, Julian's dead.
okay, this is crazy.
I would never even think of killing Julian Harper.
I've been a fan of his since he was doing cereal commercials.
Oh, so you stalked him?
is that it?
and then you killed him?
I'm in Vegas for a speech tournament.
okay, a school - supervised trip.
does that mean that my school is stalking him, too?
is the club Skin on your school schedule?
when I found out that Julian was going to be in Vegas at the same time I was, I freaked.
okay, I wanted a look, an autograph, or a picture at most.
and what I got was incredible.
go for it.
you're the one he wants.
it was like I was in one of his movies.
until he kicked me out of bed and...
and then I get off the elevator, and there's his manager handing me a wad of money.
I tip all the girls Julian's with.
so you're his pimp?
it keeps them from running their mouths.
it protects Julian's image.
it's just a part of managing his career.
I had sex with Julian because I wanted to.
but you took the money, and you bought a purse with it.
I had a conversation with Julian's lawyer.
and he said you weren't only his ex-wife, you were about to be his ex-manager.
that piss you off?
his lawyers and his agents don't like me.
they pressured him to drop me.
but Julian and I are family.
that wasn't going to happen.
Eva said if anyone asked, Julian was a gentleman.
later he took me out and got me a Katherine Baumann purse.
it's a much better story to tell my friends.
grissom: Samay and Noy go for a drive after work.
they stop at Mount Charleston.
Samay kills Noy...
...and makes it look like an accident.
and then he goes to Keo's apartment and Keo shoots him, claiming self defense.
I don't buy it.
keo shot him from the other side of a locked door.
he was waiting to blow the guy away.
which indicates that Keo knew Samay was coming.
maybe he hired Samay to kill his brother, and then he decided to cut him out of the deal.
noy had a life insurance policy issued through his union, worth ten grand.
life's getting cheaper.
who's the beneficiary?
keo was the primary, but check this out.
half the payout goes to Joe Cavanaugh.
he's not a court-approved translator.
that's why I taped it.
I just didn't tell him.
so far, he's saying what you asked him.
you must help me.
that's why I'm here.
just tell them what they want to know.
this is the part that's different.
there are many things I can tell him about you, "so you tell him this:
Samay came to my home.
I was afraid.
I thought he was there to rob me or kill me.
so I shot him.
so our interpreter is hiding something.
well, that's not lost in translation.
Mr. Cavanaugh, can you come out here, please?
we're going to have a private chat.
let's go.
in the interview, remember Keo said, "There are many things I can tell them about you"?
you didn't tell me that. You left that part out. Why?
I told you what he said.
you're not arresting me because I screwed up my translation?
you're a co-beneficiary of Noy Vipraxay's life insurance, right?
so what?
I help my guys try to get a little security for their families.
I help them in a lot of ways.
driver's licenses, green cards...
Oh, what, what?
out of the goodness of your heart?
come on, they have to come to you.
without me, they're back in a rice paddy making three cents a day.
look, some of these guys put me on their policy.
it's their way of saying thank you.
so when one of your guys kills another one of your guys, you make money out of it?
we both know that insurance companies don't even investigate claims under ten grand.
so you get a free pass.
you don't really think I'd have somebody killed for five grand?
I've seen it done for a lot less.
that don't mean I did it.
there's new casinos that open all the time.
they all got laundries.
I bring home 15 G's a month on the side.
so I am not going to bend over a dollar to pick up a dime.
Hodges, do you have the results on the fibers that we dropped off to...?
he's asleep.
: let me guess, the fibers are wool.
are you bagging Z's right now, man?
I was just having the greatest dream.
you were out.
it was the '80s and I had this Don Johnson beard, you know, the Miami Vice stubble.
it just gave me this air of danger.
my lady loved it.
um, I found two types of fibers on your guy's chin.
cotton and a polyester - lycra blend.
both dyed black.
dyed black?
the bedding might have been cotton, but it wasn't black.
the comforter and draperies may have been poly, but they weren't black, either.
I bagged some black socks and some black pantyhose.
this could be the source of the fibers.
he wasn't suffocated with his crew sock.
did you notice the burn mark on the knot in these pantyhose at the crime scene?
no. No, they were all balled up.
I just bagged them and tagged them.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we've got to get this to DNA.
stokes: I thought Greg was in the field.
is he back in the lab? I don't know.
we've got to clear this up. It's like he's confused.
lab, field, field, lab. We have a lab on wheels.
how about you guys just shut up, all right?
I'm doing this as a favor for Ecklie.
it's a one-time thing.
he's still interviewing lab techs.
you making overtime?
I'm taking one for the team.
Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.
tell me about these pantyhose.
well, I found Tally's epithelials on the inside, which is no surprise, since she was wearing them.
I also found black cotton fibers on the outside
highest concentration near the crotch.
insert joke here.
the vic had a pair of black cotton socks.
well, I did find black cotton fibers under his chin.
okay, transfer from the sock to the pantyhose, to the neck.
so the sock was in between the pantyhose and the neck?
padding.
bcp, Breath Control Play.
couples increase their partner's pleasure through strangulation.
and if you're not careful, it leaves marks.
Yeah, this guy Julian Harper's an actor, so I'm sure he didn't want bruises on his neck to be showing on camera.
there were only two girls in the suite.
which one of them killed him?
burnt pantyhose.
okay, evidence of sex games gone wrong.
I don't see how we could have missed anything.
there's no fireplace here.
I haven't seen any lighters.
well, something singed the hose.
Hey.
there's some burnt residue on this lamp.
you know what I think?
I think someone tied him up, and they couldn't get the knot undone, because it melted.
so they panicked.
and they pulled the hose down.
stokes: I'll print the light.
I guess even having an unlimited supply of hot women is not enough, huh?
bondage sex with your best friend?
it's cool, you guys were on the down low.
I don't understand.
well, we found both your prints and Julian's prints on a light fixture above the bed.
we were not down like that.
rise and shine, buddy!
room service.
BLINKY: He did it to himself, man.
he did it to himself.
I took the pantyhose, and I took them off the light.
and then I put his boxers back on.
I wasn't going to let his mom open up Us magazine and see her boy like that.
Jules, he always did me right.
now I just wanted to do him the same.
I got the serial number run down from Keo's shotgun.
he bought it last week, two days before he shot Samay.
the guy's barely scraping by, and he spends $250 on a brand-new Mossberg?
there's a word for that.
premeditation.
your brother gets killed. You killed the guy who did it with a shotgun you just bought.
and end up $5, 000 ahead.
in Nevada, that's murder one.
20 years to life.
unless you get the death sentence.
what are my client's options?
a full confession.
we make a recommendation to the DA, maybe he gets murder two.
I brought Noy here to help me.
what?
to work hard and save.
to bring our family here.
our parent.
our sister.
my wife.
instead he waste the money.
on the DVD, gambling, clothes.
Noy's life was worthless.
his death is not.
griss, we closed that actor case.
And?
accidental death as a result of auto-erotic asphyxiation.
strangled himself to death to enhance his own pleasure.
it was in the days of public hangings that people first noticed that men would get erections and sometimes even ejaculate.
they called it "the killer orgasm."
it's a waste.
guy had everything -- money, fame...
Yeah, look where he ended up.
Hey, lady.
Hey.
I can't sleep.
you want to try to eat something?
Yeah.
all right.
I'll go get him.
you get dressed.
brass: Okay, Ahren Green, 29 years old, lives here with Bianca Desmond, that's the brunette.
the blonde is Chelsea Wannamaker.
she was just spending the night.
one was asleep, one was in the bathroom.
they said Ahren was probably working on his bike.
PHILLIPS: His pupils are dilated.
lividity is consistent with body position.
looks like he bled out from a stab wound to his upper leg or pelvic area.
well, in my experience,
I found that most threesomes end up being one too many.
so, David, uh...
check and make sure that they didn't pull a Lorena Bobbitt.
take a look.
no, we're good.
my man's all there.
We're...good.
something must be wrong his gear.
he could be partying with two hot chicks inside, but he's out here working on his bike at 4: 00 in the morning?
maybe he wasn't invited.
and the other side.
what were you doing right before Ahren was killed?
cleaning.
with what?
bleach.
it's the only thing that works.
okay.
you know, you could put some clothes on if you want, if you're cold.
she won't let me back in my room.
man, I give this guy an "A" for organization.
he's got a spot for everything.
why is that helmet over there?
grissom: Maybe he threw it, defending himself.
Yeah, but he looked like he was in pretty good shape.
it'd be kind of hard for one of those women to wrestle him down.
not if she walks softly and carried a big knife.
how long have you known Ahren?
six months.
did, uh, did he have any enemies that you know of?
no, I mean... I don't know.
you don't know...
I mean, you two lived together right?
Yeah, but we were still getting to know each other.
I see.
we met one night at Light.
he was in town for a motocross race.
it was love at first sight.
I asked him to come back here, and he never left.
we actually just decided tonight to move to Colorado together.
what, just pick up and leave all this?
my father has a cabin where we could stay.
did Ahren have a job?
Yeah. Motocross racing. Right.
you said that.
he's a professional athlete.
and you, what about you? What do you do?
I'm in fashion.
Mm - hm.
what's the matter?
I have the worst luck with men.
what do you mean?
they're either jerks or they leave me, or they get killed.
what's wrong with me?
what do you got?
well, I wasn't sure if I should call it in as a 419 or a 401A.
hit and run?
you tell me.
stokes: Mm, I don't know.
when you run, you usually take the car.
the vic's Sylvia Mullins.
works in one of the offices upstairs.
the security guard found her.
did you run the plates?
that's why I went with the 419.
R. O.'s the vic.
hit with her own car in her own spot.
ms. Mullins must have been working all night.
you know, tax season.
she's an accountant?
has her own firm up on 11.
did you see anything on your monitors?
uh, no.
but I heard the crash.
I sort of fell asleep.
we're going to need to see your tapes.
Willows: Cell phone, a shoe and a briefcase.
probably lost them all on impact.
stokes: Looks like she saw the car coming.
impact's pretty evenly distributed.
the car hit her straight on.
most cars have to be going at least 14 miles an hour to trigger the airbag.
well, I can't be sure, but it looks like somebody popped the ignition.
carjacking gone bad?
vic gets off the elevator, walks to her spot...
...on the phone, distracted, catches the guy stealing her ride...
he runs her over and splits.
pedal to the metal.
Hey.
als is lighting up everywhere.
evidently she bleaches everything.
so there could be some false positives.
Yeah, including her teeth.
check out the cabinet.
sidle: Lots of teeth whitener and acne cream.
are you thinking what I'm thinking?
speed freak.
definitely.
maybe she killed Ahren in the garage then came up here to take a Silkwood shower.
okay, but she's claiming she loved him.
what's her motive?
uh, we started out at Light and then we went to Road Runner, and from there we were at Double Down, and then Copper K, and then we ended up at Drai's.
Drai's, that's a good place to end.
so what are you on besides meth?
not meth.
uh - huh.
we did some coke at the club, had a couple of drinks.
there was this guy that gave us these, uh, these blue pills, but I hato come home and lie down.
ecstasy.
we only do this when we're, when we're clubbing.
I mean, it's just a hobby, it's not a habit.
we have it under control.
well, the dead guy from the garage might beg to differ.
Eww, busy.
if Bianca killed him, and then came up here to take a shower, wouldn't she have left a trail?
maybe.
it appears she missed a spot.
Las Vegas Coroner's Office.
David, it's Warrick. Have you washed the body yet?
I just got started, but I can be done by the time you get here.
no, stop.
I uh, just found a bullet.
I have no idea who fired it.
do me a favor: test his hands for GSR and run it through the flouroscope.
no problem.
Thanks, David.
who brings a gun to a knife fight?
the killer knew how to steal a car.
no prints? No.
no, it's wiped clean.
Hey, Arch.
you get anything off the parking garage camera?
um, sort of.
stokes: What's up with the focus?
that's what I was wondering, too.
check out what happened about an hour earlier.
it's an old security cam.
adjustable focus ring.
killer was camera shy.
for good reason.
this wasn't a carjacking gone bad.
it was premeditated.
if he touched the camera, maybe I can get some prints off it.
keep working the video, Arch.
see if you can get us a face. Yeah.
robbins: Fluoroscope detected no bullets.
but there are peri-mortem bruises on his wrists and forearms, look like defensive wounds.
C. O.D?
the weapon went pretty deep. Punctured the femoral artery.
I'd say he bled out in a matter of minutes, if his dilated pupils are an indication of amphetamines in his system.
the faster the heart rate, the faster the blood pumps.
here, take a look.
the fatal blow.
weapon appears to have a triangular shape.
angle of entry was upwards.
like a cornada. I'm sorry.
a cornada-- occupational hazard for matadors during a bullfight.
the bull rears up and gores them.
so just find a bull with a bloody horn, and you've got your killer.
so your "soda-can killer" was a copper-washed . 22.
now I could only get general rifling characteristics.
six lands and grooves with a right-hand twist, um, but...
but not enough individual characteristics to run it through IS.
exactly. Sorry, man.
that's all right.
your victim did not have GSR on his hands.
okay, what about metallic trace from the garage floor?
thank you, Hodges, for performing that incredibly elaborate test requiring copious concentration and an advanced degree.
so you don't have any results from the metallic trace on the garage floor?
but I will.
that's the beauty of me.
MULLINS: Well, Mr. Miller, what I would recommend is adding some tax-deferred investments to your portfolio.
like a ROTH IRA. That's be perct for you.
miller: I never got what that ROTH stood for.
MULLINS: Hey, Kelly. Have a seat.
GORDON: Thanks for seeing me.
I know you said we didn't have to do this in person.
no, I'm really glad you came.
Kelly, your father loved you very much.
a little too much.
I just wanted to talk about his estate.
is what he did going to affect it?
well, it's kind of complicated.
woman: District Four, Parole and Probation.
Yeah, th is Nick Stokes with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
we're trying to reach Kelly Gordon's parole officer.
that's me.
great. I need Kelly's contact information.
sure, but I gave her permission to go out of town.
her bus left a couple hours ago.
Oh, hey, I'm glad you're here.
I got the results back from the blood on Bianca's bedroom floor.
the dead guy? Uh, no.
it's a male, but it's not a match to Ahren Green.
then I ran it through CODIS and I actually got a hit.
he's in the system for statutory rape a couple years back.
among other things.
so, why am I here?
what, you getting homesick for the train tracks behind Union Plaza already?
girl's like an oven in there.
used to love it in there.
how long ago was that?
a few months.
did you stop by recently to check out the competition?
no. We lost touch.
so it wouldn't bother you to know Bianca's moved on, and she's living with another guy.
it was good while it lasted.
we found your blood in her bedroom.
and her dead boyfriend in the garage.
that's funny?
Nah.
just... Bianca's all fun and games until someone shoots you in the leg.
when was that?
six months ago.
BIANCA: Hey, sweetie, I went shopping with my mom.
I'll be home late.
there's some candy for you on the table.
see you then. Love you.
man: Stay away from Bianca.
so I packed my stuff and left.
did you report it?
Nah. Still on probation for that "she-looked-18" incident.
this the guy who shot you?
didn't really get a good look.
I was too busy bleeding.
you go to the hospital?
sort of had anesthesia thing going on.
so whatever happened to the bullet?
Yeah, see, human tissue sticks pretty darn good.
and I can't scalpel it off, because I might damage the bullet's characteristics.
so, uh... so I guess we wait.
WARRICK: Half of these tools don't match the size and the shape of the wound.
and the ones that do, don't have blood on them.
the killer could have wiped it off.
I don't see why the killer would have used a tool anyway, when he had a gun.
maybe Ahern disarmed him and he grabbed whatever was handy.
take a look at this.
this guy was tweaker organized.
there's a place for everything.
except for this.
it's got no space in the pegboard and it doesn't match any of the sets.
how about that? Got anything else?
print it.
Hey, Tom Harper?
detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
may I ask you a couple questions?
do you know a Bianca Desmond?
sounds familiar.
you know she's at 1330 Wildflower Lane.
Oh, yeah, right. Her.
I installed some DSL lines there a few days ago.
she answered the door in her panties.
so you've got that hard hat, tool belt thing working for you, huh?
I wish.
kind of girl that makes you happy to be a man, know what I'm saying? Yeah, I kind of remember.
anyway, we found a tool with your prints on it in a garage, next to a dead guy.
whoa.
I - I lost an awl at a job recently.
it must have been there.
well, we're going to need to confirm that.
could you get me a work order?
Yeah, sure.
um, I'll pull one from the office.
I'll run it right over.
Kelly, where you going in such a hurry?
I have relatives in Provo.
I was going to visit them.
I cleared it with my P. O.
you gonna tell me why a state trooper pulled over my bus and yanked me off?
you know a lady named Sylvia Mullins?
Yeah.
did you have a meeting with her yesterday?
Yeah. So?
so why did you have a meeting with her?
Sylvia's handling my dad's estate. Hmm.
she's the trustee.
what's going on here?
ms. Mullins was found in her parking garage...
crushed by her own car.
and you think I have something to do with it.
when you worked in the prison garage, did you just learn how to fix cars or did you learn how to steal them?
are you kidding me?
does it look like I'm kidding you?
you waited for her to get out of work so you could let her know how you felt about her.
Sylvia was my dad's friend.
she was helping me get back on my feet.
how I felt was grateful.
CSI puts me in jail for me thing I didn't do.
do you really think I'm going to kill somebody the minute I get out?
hold out your hands.
hold out your hands.
ms. Mullins' air bag deployed on impact.
air bag dust gets everywhere.
it's really hard to get rid of.
not if it isn't there.
so the soda can bullet and the leg bullet are from the same gun?
Yeah. Bobby was able to pull more stria off the leg bullet, but still no IBIS hits.
so what about the phone guy, huh?
the utility man's always a shade-ball.
as much as I love your generalizations, actually, this time you're wrong.
the metallic scrapes on the garage floor were titanium.
the phone guy's tool was carbon steel. Remember we thought that they might be dealing meth?
brass went ahead and subpoenaed the phone and bank records.
guess who's paying Bianca's mortgage?
a Mr. Harry Desmond.
happy Harry?
gas n' Sip Harry Desmond?
who's your daddy?
no wonder she didn't work.
he owns 50 Gas n' Sips in Vegas.
well, Harry was nice enough to leave us a voice message that was listened to and saved the night of the murder.
Bianca, honey, it's Daddy.
I got your message about moving to Colorado with Ahren.
you can borrow the cabin, but we need to talk about this move.
call me, Prince. I love you.
and this is the Desmond cabin in Telluride.
Oh, maybe Mr. Desmond is trying to protect the family fortune.
or the family jewels.
I got the results back from all those sex stains on the sheets.
three donors: Ahren, Bianca and Chelsea.
I guess they were having a little threesome.
Yeah, I just really hope he was on doing one woman at a time.
chelsea is Bianca's mother.
look, I know what it's like to want to kill your daughter's boyfriend.
I don't pick fights that I can't win.
I kill this one, I got five more dipsticks waiting to take his place.
I'd just be pushing the rock up the hill.
besides,
I was in New York yesterday.
Yeah, but you didn't want them to move away together.
I wanted Bianca to get a job.
my biggest mistake in life?
giving my baby everything she ever wanted.
your wife doesn't seem to mind your lifestyle.
when Bianca was a teenager, they fought like cats in a sack.
it's good they've been spending time together.
do you know what they're doing?
well... they're shopping, dancing...
you know, girl stuff.
they're sleeping with the same man.
look...
there was no good reason for Chelsea to marry me back in the day.
I had a little money.
nothing like what we have now.
she was half my age and ten times better looking.
I thought if I kept her on a long leash...
maybe she'd never stray that far.
you the kind of guy that likes to keep guns in the house?
Yeah, of course.
I'm going to need to see them.
Hey, Catherine,
I just got back trace on Kelly Gordon's fingernails.
I was looking for air bag dust, but all Hodges found was air.
well, join the club.
no usable prints on the parking garage camera either.
okay, I'll have Sofia release her from holding.
those the vic's phone records?
Yeah.
from her office.
lots of international calls.
a lot of 345s. Mm - hmm.
Where's that?
Cayman Islands.
popular with scuba divers and money launderers.
I called a few of the numbers，all banks.
suggests offshore accounts.
it's not illegal, but it is very anonymous.
it's also a good way to siphon money away from your clients.
that's a leap.
Hey, somebody wanted this woman dead.
GORDON: Hi, CSI guy.
you wondering why you're here?
because you followed the evidence.
because that's what CSIs do.
so breathe quick, breathe slow, put your gun in your mouth and pull the trigger.
any way you like, you're going to die here.
okay. Perfect.
you're going to die here.
okay. Perfect.
Hey, Archie.
Hey, I did my best to enhance the parking garage footage, but I just can't get an image on the killer's face.
if you got a couple of minutes,
I need a voice comparison.
Yeah, what do you got?
Kelly Gordon's voice on tape.
I want to see if it's the other voice on the Walter Gordon audio file.
Grissom told you.
no, but he obviously told you.
Nick, uh...
you know what? Forget about it.
if this girl's involved, that means she's capable of murder.
it's all cued up for you.
her voice is first.
Grissom, it's Warrick.
none of the guns Bobby test-fired were a match to the bullets, but Chelsea Wannamaker purchased a . 22 in her name that was not picked up with the warrant for Harry's guns.
okay. I'm on it.
Mrs. Wannamaker.
wow, that's a hell of a rock.
I'm surprised I didn't see that the other night.
well, I don't feel safe wearing this to a club.
is that why you own a gun?
well, I used to.
but my gun was stolen out of my purse, one night when we went out.
is there something you want to say to me?
you trying to buy back some time there, Mrs. Wannamaker?
life's short, but it doesn't end at 40.
Oh, I agree with you.
but it must be tough for Bianca to have the kind of mother that'd sleep with her boyfriend.
the thing with Ahren the other night shouldn't have happened.
we were on Ecstasy...
and a line got crossed.
Oh, yeah.
lay down. Okay.
I'll come back.
all right, you come right back.
Oh, Chelsea, 'm... I'm sorry.
I totally thought you were Bianca.
that felt so good.
Bianca came in and found us.
I wish it never would have happened.
what's that, getting busy with her boyfriend or getting caught?
I want into the living room and I let the two of them talk it out.
next thing I know, she announced that they were moving to Colorado, so it seemed to me like they worked it out.
sidle: Freud would have a field day with this family.
dad loves his daughter, but Mom only sees the daughter as competition.
and everyone wonders why Bianca can't meet a boy.
Bianca eats nice boys for brunch.
Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Oh. Sara.
can you hear me?
we need an ambulance.
dispatch, this is CSI Brown.
Hey, Bianca.
how you feeling?
mrand Mrs. Desmond...
it's Wannamaker.
she's never changed her name.
ms. Wannamaker, I'm going to need a few moments alone with Bianca.
you never should've told him.
my father's an optimist. How do you think they stayed married for 20 years?
Bianca, I'm going to assume that whoever did this to you also killed Ahren.
and I'm also going to assume that you know who that is.
I think you need to stop protecting everyone from themselves.
I can't.
excuse me.
I just need to check the swelling.
how's the tenderness?
it's fine.
I hope you feel better.
nurse... Nurse?
can I get that glove you were just using?
I'm Sara Sidle, I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
here you go.
Thanks. Uh, I'm also going to wait around for the SAE kit.
she refused.
Hey, Grissom...
you want to talk to me?
Yeah, sit down.
I heard that Kelly Gordon may be a suspect in your murder case.
Yeah.
is that a problem?
no.
no, it's not a problem.
and by the way, I heard the tape.
I did a voice comparison.
Sylvia MULLINS: ROTH IRA, that'd be perfect for you.
Sylvia Mullins is the other voice on the tape.
she's Walter Gordon's ex-business manager, so...
I'm pretty sure she had something to do with my kidnapping.
but now she's dead.
Yeah.
so... it's over.
Yep.
good.
good.
I think Bianca is covering for her father.
well, we figured out the sticky stuff on Bianca's neck was creosote. It's a timber preservative found on fences, telephone poles and railroad ties.
Justin lives on the train tracks.
and he's pretty tweaked out.
Yeah, but he didn't shoot himself.
and I think that if he had done it,
Bianca would've told us.
what is it?
telephone poles.
Tom Harper's work order for Bianca's DSL line was dated December 18.
december 18...
fell on a Sunday.
how many workers you know work on a Sunday?
is this the original document?
Yeah.
I'm on it.
always the utility guy.
sidle: There were two different inks on the work order, which means the date on the work order was compromised.
Tom Harper made a service call to Bianca's house not in December, but ten months earlier, in February.
why would the guy lie?
it appears that he was a lot more to her than just the phone guy.
our bachelorette was a very busy girl.
phone calls from Bianca to Tom are in yellow, from Bianca to Justin are in blue, and from Bianca to Ahren are in pink.
there was always overlap.
bachelor number one: Tom, phone guy
strong showing from February 18 until June-ish.
she called him two, three times a day.
and then around June 5, bachelor number two enters the picture-- Justin.
ten days of overlap and then all the calls to Tom stopped until...
the week Justin was shot and moved out.
exactly.
Ahren entered the picture about five days later in mid-September.
at that point, all the phone calls to the other guys stopped until just about a week ago.
when she started calling Tom again.
every time this chick calls Tom, somebody gets shot.
it's like thermite.
Thermite?
when you combine two seemingly harmless elements
aluminum and rust
press them together, add heat...
it creates an explosion so hot it'll burn through steel.
powerful but uncontrollable.
it burns and burns until it burns itself out, finally consuming both elements.
I guess some people just shouldn't be together.
Tom Harper! Come on down!
you made me find you twice, Tom, that's a drag.
what's the problem?
you know, I think you saw Bianca in her panties more than once.
sidle: Now those could change a man.
and it looks like they did.
brass: You know, it's fill in the blank.
if it walks like a stalker, talks like a stalker...
I'm not a stalker.
then what's this?
excellent service?
here's the top of the telephone pole near Bianca's house.
Ahren was tapping your girl, so you started tapping her phone.
I only listened when I thought she was in trouble.
look, her father called her at 7: 00 a. m. New York time, that's 4: 00 in the morning in Vegas.
you had to be on the pole to hear it because we were on the scene an hour later.
Harry DESMOND: Biana, honey, it's Daddy.
I got your message about moving to Colorado with Ahren.
stay away from Bianca.
who are you?
you're not taking her to Colorado.
the hell I'm not.
I just wanted her to be happy.
with you and no one else. No.
those other guys were jerks.
I only wanted to scare him off.
Oh, like you did with Justin? That worked.
Yeah, but Bianca didn't come running back to you, so I guess you had to scare her, too.
what are you doing here?
I came to see you.
I think you should leave.
your mom wants us to be together.
my mom?!
let go!
her mother and I weren't always going to be around to clean up her messes.
wait a minute.
are you telling me that Chelsea asked you to hurt these guys?
so you have some lunatic stalker telephone repairman claiming that I told him to kill my daughter's boyfriends?
give me a break.
we have multiple calls to him from Bianca's house and it was not her.
we also have on the record that you called him from your cell.
coincidentally, right around the time
Justin was shot and Ahren was killed.
we call that solicitation for murder.
but you'd probably call it, what, good mother?
I love my daughter.
Yeah, apparently, a lot of her boyfriends, too.
I called Tom.
I asked him to scare Justin away.
he was after Bianca for her money.
I mean, we have to protect ourselves.
Yeah, but Ahren didn't love her for her money.
what was wrong with him?
so he was good enough for you, but too good for your daughter, was that it?
I mean, finding a soul mate is hard enough, but competing with your mother, that shouldn't be an issue.
that goes against... I don't know, nature.
I was attracted to Ahren...
and I was just trying to keep him away from Bianca and me.
lady, you unleashed an unstable man that you knew was in love with your daughter.
you had to know that that was not going to end well.
Willows: Oh, hey, Nick.
Nick. Yeah?
we caught a break.
the security guard confessed.
no.
Archie isolated a frame of the killer turning the focus ring.
she did it.
Las Vegas Police! Open up!
Kelly Gordon, you're under arrest for the murder of Sylvia Mullins.
stand up.
stand up!
care why I did it?
doesn't really matter now.
she told me my dad didn't leave me anything.
he never would've done that.
he loved me.
so you killed her?
the ransom was her idea.
she didn't get the money.
she took it from me.
she's ODing. She's ODing right now.
call a paramedic.
Vicodine, INH, methadone.
U know, if you THink ABOUT IT this is one of the oldest ways to kill somebody
considering where we are, highly symbolic
that youotthis well, the two-by-four is tied to the scaffold with a single loop
there is an empty pulley up here We could lower her down with that
that's probably how the kill gohe fir pla
then he ditched the rope
I wouldn't be surprised to find it around here someplace
first things first
use I'llun ithroh this pulley, and then let you take the weight
I'll mark the rope, cut the knot down she goes -Ready -Yeah
you take the weightI'll cut it on three
one Twe three -Got it? -Yeah, ready
Oh Whver eder har weht
yeah eith tha or highly motivated
you know how it is once somebody's adrenaline gets pumping
feel like they can do anything
all right, that's it 1111
father frank lives in manana land
well, I'm sure he's on his way
father frank is a wonderful priest
and since he's been here, church attendance has tripled
among our female congregants
we he sponsors for our building fund
one sponsor
the big hombre
the car dealership
time of death was sometime 2: 00 and 4: 00
nasty head wound
she was actively bleeding, so she had to have been alive when she was tied tohe css
t ed of sfocaon
like jesus
well, jesus had a footrest
he was able to lift himself up and take short breaths 2222
probably became paralyzed and the intercostal muscles were unable to function
she was able to breathe out, but not breathe in
in time, carbon dioxide built up in her lungs and bloodamup in the cst city
he heart went into fibrillation gruesome torture in any century
in 18 years, this is my first crucifixion
in a catholic church with no crucifes
I imagine the priest is a resurrection theologian, as opposed to a crucifixion theologian
they believe in forgivenes srather than penance
we could all use a little forgiveness
she was bleeding from her head wounds, and the beating didn't take place up there the blood pool !!!!
and the blood trail...
the tips are pointing towards the statue
she s blooding On the way here
I' backtrack, see if I can find the point of origin
excuse me, huh I-I get to go, father -l see you -okay
I'm the pastor of the church
Hey, captain
he'll take care of you
father frank berlin
I'm jim brass, las vegas police 3333
Weposeto bhere agowheryou be beenervi breakfast at the shelter
I understand there's been a death in the church
how soon before you're out of here
father, this is a murder investigation
it's just we hold ma at 10: 00,
I desorr fatr, but uh, this is a crime scene
you're not gonna get your church back for a while
is it all right if we set mass in the community center
Yeah, sure, I have no problem with that
er, uld 'll sinng "in paradisum " I'll take care of it, father
we sing the hymn for the dead every time we have a death
sisters couldn't identify the victim, so we'll need you to take a look
dn't antor
it's just we've had over half a dozen deaths this year
we've never had to close the church
that's because, in this neighborhood, those derelicts and drug aictsdd died of heatstroke, d olage
none of them were strung up in the rafters
father frank berlin, this is gil grissom from the crime lab
do you recognize her
I'll take thas a no
excuse me, father
is that blood on your jacket
we had a fight in the shelter, I had to break it up
we're gonna need can'he brass:
4444
then you have to come downtown to the police station
if you're gonna say mass later, you have to change anyway, right
Greg, withiclotng
is it a bigger sin to lie if you're a priest
I hope so this one for you, M 'S when will I get those back, I only have three sets of clothes
respectfully, father, a woman's been murdered in your church @@@
you're lucky you're not under arrest was there bougainvillea at the crime scene
two shrubs at the entrance of the church
a w ofour theall onof the community center
three bushes behind the rectory adjacent to the statue of st Jude
did u ancipa thayoqueson er to impress me withyour powers of observation -Memory's a gif -Mmm
from whom
o doou tnk
well, I wouldn't necessarily call myself an atheist but I am not sold on the notion of a higher power
however, edo s of the saint
this job certainly challenges your faith
Yes, it does
but I have science
I believe we need a little of both
sometimes I think we made up god just to have someone to blame for our mistakes
it's just a theory
Hey, I found i s, hmers everything
Oh, yeah -sth i said? -not do you
I didn't offend you, did I?
did I say something offensive to you as a catholic
I'm not really a catholic anymore, you know
I that involves ritualizing certain aspects of everyday life and imbuing them with a spiritual intensity they might not otherwise possess 5555
and the rosary beads are a part of that
its blong to my mom take a look at this pattern
five series of ten beads each reesenng t ive mysteries" separated by five "our father" beads
who would strangle someone with a rosary
probly the same person who would crucify someone in a chuh
St Jude
patron saint of lost causes
and that's why it's so difficult to keep the local kids from defacing this statue
did you run those tests on my clothes
we did
the blood on your clothes is not a match to the blood on the victim
so do I get my clothes back
not just yet
I have a favor to ask
you steal my clothes and then you want to ask for another favor
we'd like permission to search your rectory and the nun's apartments
just because someone dies in our church doesn't mean we have anything to do with it
well, we want to eliminate you as suspects
that's what you said when you fingerprinted us, and the truth is you don't have enough for a warrant
you're right
but you have nothing to hide
you really think if I killed a woman, I'd leave her body in my own church
it's so obvious that it obviates suspicion
Mmm, I'm not that smart
well, that's hardly the argument to make
what is it you're looking for
rosaries
MrGrissom, I didn't realize you were here
that's all right, sister
we don't have to hide anything from mrGrissom
uh, he's here to confiscate our rosaries
I don't know where mine are, Do you
it's probably in the sacristy
we'll need all the rosaries
uh, even sister elizabeth's
she's not going to like that
happy day for sister elizabeth, for she delights in what she dislikes
the killer used materials from the church:
the rope, the 2x4s, and one of these hammer I just haven't found it yet
but all this was in the same utility closet -He didn't bring anything with him -Hmm-mm -What does this feel like to you -Inside job
I mean maybe one of the construction workers wasn't a fan of the victim
I'm going to call brass -What -I've solved your case -Bull -No, cow
those hairs you found on the scaffold: Not human, Bovine
they have red cows
you betcha, partner. Guernseys
maybe the scaffold was used somewhere else, Like on a farm
or maybe it was secondary transfer
well, you can take care of that
I've done all the heavy lifting, As usual
I saw you at the crime scene
I thought you were on desk duty until the coroner's inquest
Yeah, I was starting to get a serious case of trucker butt so I told grissom that I wanted to, uh, get back out with the team
Yeah, there's no therapy like work
you doing okay
yeah
well, hang in there
all right mr Bombay
we found your keys at the scene of our murder
we also found your car close by
I don't know anything about a murder
well, we also found a wad of bloody tissues in the front seat of your vehicle
what... what's going on
you tell me
I loaned my car to a woman I work with last night
she sings at my club
Charlotte danville -Is she all right? -Was this your friend
Yeah, that's her
who did... who did this to her
why did she borrow your car
she had to... she had to do another set and needed to change her clothes
doesn't she have her own car
she had a lexus -Totally tricked out -So why did she borrow yours
I don't know, I didn't get the whole story
she seemed upset
she was talking to this guy
I had to send a waitress over to remind her that she was getting paid to sing
you ever see the guy move forward
Yeah, it's that guy that sells cars on television
uh... cody whit
I mean, but a lot of guys came in to see charlotte
I mean, it's not like she slept around or anything
I tried
can I go now
not without an alibi
where did you spend the night
I allowed myself to succumb to the pleasures of donna
and she kept me up to the wee hours of the morning gratifying her abnormal lust
she sleeps with her eyes open
Yeah, this is it
well, this car's already been cleaned and detailed
it's ready to be sold
well, I guess it's a change of plans
noNo, there's not a change of planes
this baby's staying right where she sits
I'm not in the give-away-the-car-to-cops business
I'm in the sell-the-car-to-willing-victims business
mr White, we have a court order to examine this car for evidence related to the murder of charlotte danville charlotte
she and I are friends
I... I knew her
Yeah, I know
we have a witness who places you arguing with her last night
you may be one of the last people to see her alive
yeah
I was with her
I went to see charlotte to give her the car
helped charlotte through a rough patch, but lately she been ducking me
what am I supposed to do now
walk home
I'll give you money for a cab
tomorrow, we'll see about getting you a good used car
some junker, Thanks a lot
some friend you are
take your damn car
guess that's what you get for helping a friend, you know
look, I feel awful about charlotte, I really do
but I'll tell you this: Whatever happened happened after I got this car
well, I feel awful too, but the car is coming with me
no sign of forced entry 6666
does this look like the condo of a woman who sings weekends at the gorilla room
looks like the fight started here
got some blood, some here on the pillow
but no blood trail
the real beating took place in the bushes at the church
this was just the opening act
explains the bloody tissue found in the backseat of hugo's car
I guess she got a bloody nose or a fat lip here, ran out and used hugo's car to go to the church
the killer must have followed her and caught up with her there
she had quite the career
Sofia
you recognize that guy
father frank
I mean, a lot younger, obviously
you know him
no
that's the big hombre, He sells cars on tv
she's known these guys forever
here's a rosary
looks like it's broken
could be the one she was strangled with
and here's her purse and cell phone
you don't leave home without those unless you're in a hurry
or you're being chased
DVD's on pause well, there they are again
someone was taking a trip down memory lane
they tear us apart there was a man in her life
mr Frisky
drain smells like whiskey, empty bottles in the trash, more liquor than you could use in a wild weekend
she might have been going on the wagon
folic acid
fresh fruit, vegetables, plenty of milk
you think she was pregnant
we'll have robbins run a pregnancy test hey
got another rosary for your collection
Where'd you get this
Catherine found it in charlotte's condo
there is some evidence that the fight started there
Charlotte's bag and cell phone were there, as if she left in a hurry
are those father frank's
yeah
Where's father frank
father frank is hearing confessions tonight
it's st Bart's all over again
only that time, he went in handcuffs
that never happened
it was just a rumor 7777
8888
hey
didn't your mother tell you you're not supposed to fight in church
Cody white
what's up, hombre
father frank and i are actually old friends
just having a conversation about church finances
but aren't you the one who's funding the renovation of the church
not anymore
well, there you go -We done herE -Yeah
so what sins did he commit to earn the punch-out penance
let's talk about it downtown
these are unique rosaries, father
handmade in italy
and they're sequentially numbered on the back
so we know that they were purchased together
one of them is yours, one we found at the victim's condo -Did you give it to her? -Yes
you know, father, when we asked you if you knew her you said you didn'T
after I saw charlotte's body, I don't recall being asked any questions
um, uh, maybe I said "no" to what I was seeing
I don't really remember much about yesterday
what about the night before
I was at the shelter
you know, we can't find anyone who remembers seeing you there after midnight
because I wasn't there past midnight
where were you
one of our regulars, marty, came in high on crack
he got into an argument, a fight with one of the other men -and I... -what time was that
uh, it was late
I don't wear a watch
we had to call the paramedics; you can check with them
Charlotte died around 2: 00 AM, Where were you then
I was out with marty trying to walk off his high to keep him out of trouble
does crackhead marty have a last name
I-I don't know
you know, father, listen,
I'm telling you, these answers-- none of them work for me
well, then put me in jail
I'll still be doing exactly the same work I'm doing out here with exactly the same results
I don't want to do that
sister bridget
I think you should see this, cap
I'm sorry I didn't come forward sooner, father
we caught her trying to bring this into the building
this is the hammer I used to build the cross
no, no, she didn'T
she must've got that out of my office at the shelter
I took it off marty
father, sit down, please
sister, excuse me, but...
could you tell us how you managed to haul the victim's body to the top of the scaffolding
I used the rope and the pulley, the one the workmen use
but why did you kill her
because she had to be stopped
she was coming for father, and I couldn't let that happen
now...
do your job
arrest me
sister, how much do you weigh 123 pounds
it's a question of physics
Charlotte weighed 140 pounds, plus the weight of the cross
you don't weigh enough or have enough strength to have hoisted the body 17 feet into the air
it was a miracle
the only miracle is I'm not charging you with obstruction father frank
the blood on the hammer is a match to the blood found on the father's clothes but none of it is from charlotte
well, you know, he told me that he broke up a fight at the shelter
I think sister bridget found the bloody hammer and confessed to the murder because she thought father frank was guilty
if she thinks he did it, maybe he did it
but why does she think that he did it
you know, his move from st Bart's to st Jude's involved a female parishioner who committed suicide
no charges were filed, but the parish board asked that he be removed
I can do you one better
Catherine found two sets of semen stains on charlotte's bedding
unknown contributor on the bed skirt. Probably doesn't get washed as often
but the one on the sheet is a match to father frank
it's probably more recent
and here is the big thing
uh, doc robbins says that charlotte was about ten weeks pregnant
maybe he's the unwilling father of her unborn child
well, dna will give us a profile
one more thing that he did not tell us
we didn't ask
I don't know, I mean, most people give their friends uh, subscriptions to fruit of the month club but you gave your friend charlotte a condo and a car
it's like I told you before,
I was helping her out I was letting her live there and use the car till she got on her feet
she came back to vegas broke and strung out, and I was helping her
so it was supposed to be a short-term thing
it was supposed to be short-term, but it was endless
sort of like renovating st Jude'S
so is that what the fight in the church was about
no, that's not what the fight was about
I went to talk to him about charlotte
I thought maybe taking the car back had something to do with her death.
I don't know. Then he said something,
I said... I don't even remember, to tell you the truth
but I'll tell you this: He lost it
I've never seen frank like that
so do you always have personal conversations in the confessional
can't talk to him in his office with that sister bridget hovering around
besides, I'd never want his relationship with charlotte to be open to misinterpretation
now, why would their relationship be open to misinterpretation
they were more than friends
going by her scrapbook, this seems to have been a golden time in charlotte's life-- high school
there's a lot of pictures of the three of them together but the only two-shots are of frank and charlotte except for this one
evidently, she wentto her prom with cody
doesn't look too happy
the next picture of frank, he's in a seminary
maybe, uh, giving up charlotte was the sacrifice he made to join the church
I need to ask you a few more questions
go ahead and ask the question you really want to know
who killed charlotte danville
I did
single malt express is leaving the station as soon as I get home
look, I know it sounds nuts, but this is not the way a resurrection theologian would kill his pregnant mistress
he confessed
he's a catholic They're full of guilt
he's a priest, for god's sakes
that's the whole point of the priesthood
no sleeping around
more energy for good works and noble deeds
now you find me some evidence to exonerate the good father, and we'll talk
hi I heard grissom wants us to keep digging -This charlotte's car -Yeah
I found blood smears, but they've been washed
Cody said he repo'd the car at the club and drove it back to the lot
there shouldn't be any blood in this car
well, unless father frank drove it that night, and we've got no reason to believe that he did
which brings us back to cody
do you have a big enough sample for dna
no
but I do know one spot the detailers never hit
bloody shoe impression on the brake pedal
well, I'll compare it to father frank's shoes
if it's not a match, I'll get a warrant for cody's shoes
I'll get a sample of the blood to dna
I'm trying to shoot a commercial here, so I don't see why this can't wait
I can't even read this, so why don't you tell me what it is that you want
your boots and a dna sample
well, there's my wife
candy, Get my damn lawyer on the phone now
what's wrong
would... would you just do it, please
we found rust-colored fur on the scaffold at the crime scene
well, I'll call a judge and get him to amend the warrant to include the vest
J-j-j-j-j-J... hold on for a minute, all right
would you just hang on
Hey, I found these in his office
positive for blood on the right sole
Where's my wife, Candy
well, big hombre, it looks like you're going to the hoosegow so, you don't like crucifixes, but maybe you made an exception when you found out charlotte was pregnant
father...
I want you to take a look at this
I'm responsible for her murder, I could never do that
in my world, father, you're either guilty or innocent
well, in my world, you can be both
the blood on your boot is charlotte'S
your footprint was found on the brake pedal of her car in blood
the lab also matched hair from your fur vest to hair found dried in the blood of the victim in the church no matter how much evidence you have,
I'm the big hombre
I get whatever I want, including store-bought justice
and yet, the one thing you couldn't get was charlotte's love
Yeah, like I said,
I only saw her that last time to get the car thanks for coming
come on. I'd come every night if you wanted me to, You know that
here's the car back
you're a good friend
no, you gave her the car
you gave her everything
and how did she pay you back
she dumped you for your best friend here's the car back
and I'm moving
why would you do that
I can't do this anymore
it's not right
I'm in love with another man
I'm sorry, cody
that's what you got for me
you got, you're sorry
I'm sorry, too
we, found a letter you wrote to the bishop and pulled it off your computer "The spirit has left my vocation "I've crossed a line in my discipline
and committed an act That has left me unfit for the priesthood
what act is that
putting my love for charlotte above my love for god
so, you were leaving the priesthood
I was leaving because I loved her, and I wanted to be with her in all ways
her ing doesn't change that I still love her
I talked to the monsignor
it's a complicated process, but I told him I'm leaving
are you sure
I prayed about it
what came to me was that god is love
wherever there is true love, god is, as well
I have to follow my heart
and we only made love once, but in the wake of that,
I found the husband in me, the father in me
I wanted to be those men for her
and I always loved her
and what if the baby wasn't yours
a child is always welcome
Yeah, I decorated her condo, you know that
I bought her that car
special-ordered the paint to match the color of her eyes
she didn't care as long as she had a place to stay
that's all she cared about
she cared about father frank, didn't she
did you suspect that she was leaving you for him
should have, but I didn'T
what are you doing here
look, I'm sorry about the dress, all right
I have to get back to the club
wait, wait, wait
I want to know who you're leaving me for
no what is that
it's frank, isn't it? Isn't it it's always been frank you know, he doesn't think you did it
but I think that you know who killed charlotte
he came to the church that day to confess, didn't he
bless me, father, for I have sinned
my last confession was two weeks ago
I lied to my wife seven times
I cheated an old lady out of a classic car
and I killed my best friend for cheating on me with you
you know I can't discuss that
you know, in vegas, it's routine to hear the most heinous sins, and as a priest, you listen, and in christ's name, you forgive
I knew she'd go running to him
she'd always run back to frank, and I knew he wouldn't be there
he was never there
is that when you thought of crucifying her in frank's church
I don't know how I came up with that
you know, frank always used to talk about the problem of human evil
how... you better watch out 'cause it'd come into you in times of despair
something terrible came into me that night
I loved charlotte more than anything
the paternity test came back
you were the father
you killed your own baby you were my friend
you should have come to me like a man
can you forgive him
that's christ's mandate
you know what that means
you have no choice
Oh my god man I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
I love you, Mikey.
that is at I love about this town.
they've got good eggs benedict 24 hours a day.
just getting off shift?
no, I'm going in early. Thank you.
do you ever eat dinner?
you're looking at it.
okay, I'll see you at the lab. Bye.
can I get a check please?
that guy over there already paid and tipped.
says he's your friend.
how's it going, Mike?
what are you doing here, Frank?
what do you want me to do?
you don't return my calls.
I tried calling you, but I've been, uh... busy.
you didn't make it to amy's memorial mass.
Yeah, I know.
I got the card from father Anthony.
couldn't get away this year.
it's okay.
Dennis graves and I decided to come to Vegas for a few days, blow off some steam.
you like standing? Sit down.
I can't.
look, Frank, I got to run.
we'll get dinner later in the week, all right? I'll call you.
listen, I,uh...
I'm in a bit of a fix; I need you to do me a favor.
I can't do it this time. Okay?
don't ask me to do it, Frank.
things are just starting to...
Hey. What are you getting so excited about?
I didn't say anything.
I'm just getting the lay of the land here, you know?
trying to move on.
I got it, bad timing.
you all right?
don't you worry about it.
I'll sort it out.
looks like it's you and me again, Hoss.
you got a problem with that?
no, no, I like your style.
it's just the whole suit thing you got to work on a little bit.
Yeah, yeah, what do we got?
two gunshot victims.
male, two shots in the chest.
female shot in the back, and her hand is missing.
why take just one hand?
maybe there was something on it he wanted.
boxer shorts, socks.
I'm guessing this is his. You see another suitcase?
no, no, I did not.
looks like she was just visiting.
45 automatic.
no purse...
no valuables.
did you see a safe?
no.
no, no safe in here.
looks like a robbery.
Hey, this guy has a bunch of law enforcement logo shirts hanging up in here.
check the bible drawer.
anything?
nine millimeter service pistol?
stamped "T. P.D.
could be any city starting with T.
I didn't find any nine millimeter casing, so this weapon was never fired.
the room is registered to a Dennis graves Trenton, New Jersey.
he's a cop, Trenton, pd.
Hey, you're from Trenton. Do you know him?
no.
who found them?
his buddy, Frank Mccarty.
so what were you two guys doing in Vegas?
playing a little golf, indulging in the buffets.
is that all you indulged in?
we were down in the bar, Dennis picked up a date.
is she the date?
I didn't get a name.
anyway, they went upstairs, I played a little blackjack.
then what?
then, I pulled some strings and got us a tee time at the Wynn.
Dennis didn't answer his phone.
I figured he was busy going around the world.
after a while, I... I knew something was wrong.
I got hotel security to open the door.
excuse me. Yeah?
captain, we got press all over the place.
can you stick around? I'll be right back.
Yeah, sure.
okay. Mr. Mccarty?
if you don't mind.
you want to tell me what I'm seeing here, Frank?
could be anything.
pimp went off on his whore.
robbery gone bad. It's a dangerous town.
have a seat.
Yeah.
heard we have a dead out-of-town cop.
Yeah, detective Dennis Graves.
Trenton pd.
Trenton? - Yeah.
David, you got the T. O.D?
about four hours ago.
male was shot twice, both frontal.
no exits.
the girl was shot once in the back.
did you find the hand?
I'm guessing the killer's got it, along with the rest of their valuables.
Hey, Catherine, check this out.
I've got an uncapped bottle of mouthwash here.
probably come back to the hooker.
Yeah, but I've got something else, and this is good.
there are quite a few long, light-colored hairs snagged in the soap dish right there.
not a match to either victim.
sloppy housekeeping?
I doubt the maid would miss this.
what appear to be high heel shoe impressions.
I checked, again, no match to the working girl.
bath towels haven't been used.
so who was in the tub with her shoes on?
keppler, do me a favor.
go over by the body, will you?
yeah?
I can see you; can you see me?
Yep.
what about if I get low?
not anymore.
so either she was lying in wait...
or an eyewitness tried to hide from a killer.
let's pull the elevator surveillance.
maybe we can find a blonde who got off on this floor.
welcome back, Dr. Grissom.
it's good to be back, Judy.
there are no words to describe how glad I am you're back.
but I'm sure you'll find some.
the lab almost went to hell in a handbag while you were sabbaticalling.
I'm sure you talked to Catherine, but just in case you didn't...
lot of hurt feelings, so in case you talk to Nick...
I'd rather hear it from Catherine, thanks.
fair enough, but, uh, permit me to say that the "seasonal behaviors of the Walden pond swamp mosquito
was an incredibly stimulating seminar.
and you know this how?
I took your course online. It's free to alumni.
Oh, you're Spanky.
Seven-four-three.
I aced the final, didn't I?
post-mortem tool marks to the left wrist.
no vital reactions from the tissue.
cuts are scalloped, definitely a serrated blade.
not a bad job.
anything to help us identify her?
david printed the right hand. No hits on afis.
lucky for you, like many young ladies her age, she had some surgical work done.
feel these.
what do you think?
implants.
kind of big for my taste, really.
the other end.
Oh, they're for the butt?
Yes.
implants are serialized. We can get an id from those.
you know, I spent 12 hours on a court bench last week.
I could have used a pair of these bad boys.
what about C. O.D?
single gunshot to the back, just to the right of the spinal column.
bullet severed the aorta, lodged inside the sternum.
and the cop?
I removed these from detective graves.
large caliber, too.
I'll get those to ballistics.
okay, so I'll run the serials?
Yeah.
I am an ass man.
Hi, Gil Grissom.
how's everybody been treating you?
no complaints, you've got a great team.
Yeah, thanks.
does Ecklie still have you slotted for days?
as far as I know.
I hear you're working the double homicide at the Olympia. What have you got?
Oh, it's uh, bullets from doc Robbins. I was going to run them through ibis.
the dead cop was from your hometown, huh?
Yeah. Retired.
did you know him?
you know how many retired cops there are in Trenton?
well, it's great to finally meet you.
same.
I love you, Mikey.
Hey.
Hey.
I said,"how do you feel about butt implants?
you don't need them?
thank you. I wasn't really talking about me, but...
Oh, right. Sorry.
you got something on the dead cop case?
the blond hair from the tub does match the saliva left in the mouthwash bottle.
and it's female, but not from the dead hooker with the big back seat.
second female in the room uses mouthwash.
more than likely another hooker.
looks like we got a witness.
Dennis should've lived long enough to spoil his grandkids.
he was a good man, good cop.
good enough to spot a hooker when he saw one?
you don't have to be a cop to have that radar.
so tell me about Dennis.
you know, two's company, three's a party?
cause there was another girl in the room with him.
Really?
I only saw him leave.
so as far as you know, there wasn't a blond in there with him?
Dennis?
he could barely handle one.
besides, he was a little tight with the buck.
I'm looking at the over- under in the suns game.
what do you think?
I don't bet sports anymore.
not what I hear.
according to Stokes, you're at the top of your game.
well, why don't you get your picks from him with his fat Texas mouth.
I'd take the over.
Hey.
want some help?
welcome back.
what do you got?
well, I'm just following a lead off some serialized butt implants.
I missed Las Vegas.
what are you doing here?
I'm avoiding the paperwork and mail that's piled up on my desk.
well... we got a, uh, dead prostitute's apartment.
it's obvious that it's been ransacked and robbed.
I'm thinking that she was the target of the double and the cop was collateral.
where would you like me to start?
you can hit the dinette. I haven't taken that yet.
unless you're avoiding her paperwork, too. There's a lot of it.
well, she was past due.
but seems to have paid her telephone bill on time.
telephone. Hooker's lifeline.
I'm telling you, whoever hit this place left a lot of prints.
I, uh, heard there was some friction in the lab while I was gone.
you ever hear of "reverse forensics"?
there was someone else in that hotel room.
I know.
I need a name.
I don't have one.
don't let me down, kid. You got to help me here; I'm counting on you.
you okay?
Yeah.
well, I tracked down the plastic surgeon that augmented Courtney Evans' Glutes.
probably the only implants ever paid for in cash by, get this...
her pimp, a guy named Eric Hong, Aka...
precious Ricky,huh?
Yeah, that's what my mama calls me.
precious "Licky."
is she one of yours?
no, ain't seen her before.
you bought her butt cheek implants.
is that something you normally do for girls you don't know?
Oh, see, that's the problem. You're showing me the wrong end.
okay.
so, then she is one of yours, right?
Hey, I run an escort service. Strictly legal.
I'm sure it is.
so what did she do, precious?
she makes you mad?
no. No, I don't get mad, man.
I'm blissed out. I'm a Buddhist.
I let the anger flow right through me.
sentient beings are numberless, and I vow to save them.
I didn't do nothing to her.
nothing? Like cut off her hand, and you kill the cop she was with?
we know Courtney was with a blond last night.
long hair.
you got anyone who matches that description?
april, May and June, too.
but you know what?
the cuffs don't always match the collars, you know what I...
now, look, Ricky, maybe you're a nice guy, maybe you're not, but right now i really don't care, because I think you're lying to me.
and that could go very badly for you.
do you understand what I'm saying?
okay, Okay.
they were all on the clock last night.
it was a bachelor party.
Nick, Mike, can you step out a minute?
miss Mcfarland is a baby-sitter, of sorts.
I wouldn't leave her with my cat. I think she likes the pipe.
she claims that that baby belongs to Courtney Evans.
she had a baby? Damn.
