that can't possibly be.
did you tell him it was I who have come?
my lord, are you not there?
it is I, Hee-yeon.
Oh, you are here.
I wish to speak to you about something.
what is it?
why is it that you want me to leave first?
I have some business to attend to.
if you do not mean to reject me, could I not wait for you and leave together?
no.
what do you mean?
it means that I cannot help it.
I don't understand.
are you sure you will come join me in Beijing?
we've been seeing each other for two seasons now.
that's too long for me.
I'm not usually like that.
so I cannot help it.
then, allow me to ask one more thing.
were all the things you said to me, were they all untrue?
I thought I had changed, but I guess it's not in human nature to do so.
the moment I knew you loved me, my love changed.
why did you?
you should not have loved me.
I'm sorry, this is what I am.
even I cannot help myself.
why are you doing this to me?
what have I done wrong?
if you really wish to know, I can tell you.
your first mistake was that you met me.
your second mistake was that you listened to me.
and your third mistake was that you did not leave me when I gave you the chance.
and so I tell you, I cannot help it.
stop! Please stop!
how could you turn into a different person so quickly?
if it's some cruel joke, please stop.
my heart aches so much
I can hardly breathe.
you must have another reason.
it's a long way to Beijing, so you should go now.
sir.
have you always seduced and made so many women your victims like this?
that is enough, madam.
such behavior does not fit a noble lady!
how can you be so insensitive?
what are you waiting for?
escort the lady out!
madam!
you sure are merciless.
so how does this story end?
that pathetically faithful woman, like the queen of self-pity she is, did not go to China, but returned to her plagued home, treating the sick while repenting her shameful mistake.
but for some reason, she neither eats nor drinks, and lives like a living corpse.
so the man has accomplished what he set out to do.
it is a more definite proof of conquest than the bloodstain of a virgin.
and having accomplished all his tasks he shall receive his reward.
with it we will both have a very happy ending.
you are a real mystery.
I thought I knew you well, but it seems now I know nothing.
the will to possess and the will to destroy.
a woman ruled by only two things.
so?
which way do you want to go?
I will not come see you again.
while knowing what will happen in pursuing what you can't have?
isn't it the same either way?
farewell.
I was afraid.
to imagine that I would feel the pain that I had always given to the other person.
it was frightening.
madam.
sir Cho Won has given me this letter for you to read.
I do not know him.
please go away.
madam! Madam!
I have failed my state official's exam.
I must return to the country to concentrate on my studies.
but I wish to see you one last time.
I must confess that I have deceived you for some time.
soon after coming to this home, it so happened that I fell into the arms of Sir Cho Won.
but after I saw you, I had a change of heart.
having accepted him first, my body had become used to him, and my suffering has grown ever since.
and so,
I was going to confess to you, and stop our letters, but Sir Cho Won found it amusing, and made me keep writing to you.
I knew it was wrong, but I could not refuse the command of the one I love.
only recently,
I discovered that Sir Cho Won had been sleeping with Lady Jung.
and so in my grief I write this letter in tears.
if it's not the plague, what is wrong with my lady?
I better bring Sir Cho Won here.
do not try to find out who I am.
lady Jung has been sleeping with Cho Won, who's staying at Lord Yu's home.
just ask him.
he knows everything.
lady Jung has fallen ill from the shock she received from his deceit.
seems like it'll be fun today.
drinking again so early?
I heard that a dance troupe is here to perform.
why don't you come with us?
who is it?
tell your master to send someone quicker next time.
are you not the persimmon warrior?
what the hell do you mean?
you lay under the persimmon tree, waiting for the fruit to fall into your mouth.
do you not?
is it true that you slept with my sister-in-law?
Yes, but the sin was my own.
it was all my doing.
having done it, did you forsake her?
that was not my fault.
I just asked to end it.
you bastard.
I will punish you for disgracing my family and my sister-in-law!
just say that you're jealous.
shut up, you bastard!
you will really kill someone.
it will become nothing once time passes.
now leave.
I have someone I must go to meet.
madam!
are you okay now?
master!
Oh, master!
what has happened?
master, shouldn't you go to a doctor?
take...
take me to her...
I was only pretending but it ended up being the truth after all.
didn't I tell you that you've met your match?
why were you afraid to keep her?
when I could not trust myself, that's when I was most frightened.
I still do not know who I am.
but still...
all I want is to see her...
can you really make it there?
master?
master! Master!
this is awful.
master! Master!
I dream of starting a new with my love.
but it matters not even if I do not have the chance.
because through you
I have finally learned how to love.
even with my eyes closed,
I can feel your breath.
if it is not too late, will you forgive me?
madam!
master Cho has...
he has...
No! This can't be!
go back to your work.
there's nothing here for you to see!
I told you we were not meant to be in this world.
but up there, we could say we are a married couple, and no one will say anything.
lord Yu's brother-in-law was stabbed to death.
he had it coming.
they say that it was his servant who killed him.
that is said to be Lady Cho.
is it true?
who would have thought.
though it is an immoral world we live in, we are a nation of propriety.
as a gentleman I cannot let this go by.
this is unimaginable, considering how proper my daughter-in-law has conducted herself till now.
since we've obtained most of the illustration books, why don't we keep silent about this incident?
silence is no solution for such an outrage.
but if we were to do something about it, it will bring the family shame.
this is quite a dilemma.

fifteen years in a dark, damp underground cell.
I still can't understand what it is we done wrong, Mother.
well, now, it's nothing like that, dear.
weren't you comfortable enough here? Was that it?
I've purposely left you my few bits of good furniture.
I don't see the use of leaving it till I'm dead.
Stevie? - Yes, Winnie?
you go and do some of your drawing.
I'll fetch you when it's time to bring the luggage down.
all right, Winnie.
what you want to say that for in front of him?
you know how upset he gets if anyone talks about dying.
Oh, I'm sorry, Winnie.
I wasn't thinking. I'm all of a fluster.
is the cabbie here yet?
... The radical change we're all of us working towards.
the revolution cannot be provoked. It must arise spontaneously...
by the will of the people at the moment when it becomes clear to them...
that capitalism is ready to collapse...
under the weight of its own contradiction.
have you still not understood, Michaelis, that your damn pessimism...
is a way of lying down and allowing the oppressor to march all over you?
Pessimism.If I were a pessimist...
don't you suppose that sometimes in those 15 years...
I would have found a way to cut my throat?
I could've beaten my head in against the walls of my cell.
no. I'm not advising a resignation or indifference.
I am counseling patience!
'Patience..."another word for doing nothing.
you are saying that all action is useless.
worse than that. You are offering encouragement...
to those economic cannibals...
who drink the blood and feed on the flesh of the people.
hear, hear. - No, no, no. Patience is not submission.
it's a state of mind in which to complete the necessary preparations for the future.
if I could find three men... three...
capable of having no feeling for anything on earth...
including themselves, then I could make the necessary preparations for the future.
you cannot force what must happen of its own accord.
before long, the property owners...
will begin to fight among themselves...
and in the meantime they hold their branding irons against the skin of the people.
we must hear it sizzle...
and make no response...
except for your damned patience...
to the smell of burning...
Stevie! What's the matter?
Br... Br... Branding irons must hurt, Winnie! Think how they must hurt!
never mind that. The cab's here. Help Mother down with the luggage.
it's gotta be stopped, Winnie! It's gotta be stopped!
come along. Don't you worry about it. Mr. Verloc will stop it.
we're trying to conduct a meeting down here! Stop that fuss! Stop it!
Shh! - I'm so...
I'm... I'm s... I'm sorry, Mr. Verloc. - We're just leaving.
come on.
um, I'm, uh... I'm sorry, gentlemen.
it's, uh... We'll take a short pause.
my mother-in-law is moving out this evening.
it's very good, this. Absolutely typical.
what's very good?
exactly what you would expect from a degenerate.
I wouldn't let my wife hear you call him that if I was you.
she's very fond of her brother.
it's a purely scientific term. - Yeah.
thank you ever so much, Mr. Verloc.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
please allow me. - Mr. Michaelis.
Mrs. Verloc.
I can manage, Mr. Ossipon. - Please, call me Tom.
I thought your name was Alexander.
it is, but all my most special friends call me Tom.
listen to me. Listen.
you can come back anytime you wish.
Oh, Mr. Verloc! You're so kind!
listen. Do me a favor, will you, young fella? Load the bags for me.
not supposed to do no lifting.
well, go on, then.
is he all right... your brother?
he's a little upset today. - Oh. Upset.
I'm ever so grateful, Mr. Verloc. - No, no. Not at all.
tell her, Adolf. Nobody wanted her to go.
what? Oh, oh. No, no. Of course not.
thank you.
I won't be long. - I'll get rid of them as soon as I can.
safe journey. - Come on. Back to the meeting.
no, no. - Hey?
don't whip. - Huh?
you mustn't whip. It hurts. - Mustn't whip, eh?
Giddap!
Hyah!
Giddap!
Hyah!
Giddap! Giddap!
Yaah!
this is all your idea, Mother, so I don't know why you're carrying on.
I can't help it, love. I'm sorry.
you haven't quarreled with Mr. Verloc, have you?
no, no. Of course not.
Mr. Verloc's always been the soul of generosity.
then whatever is it decided you to leave us?
I never could get used to that shop.
I had to keep my eyes shut every time I passed through.
it wasn't exactly the sort of place you could ask people back for a cup of tea, is it?
it's a steady business.
I don't know what your dad would've said.
dad was a brute. - Winnie!
well, he was. He used to take it out on Stevie something terrible.
well, Stevie was a disappointment to him.
he couldn't get used to the idea of having a boy who was a bit, well not quite right in the head.
well, taking his belt off to him wasn't gonna make him any cleverer, was it?
Hup!
Hey!
it's all right, Winnie. - You get back up this minute.
no. It's all right, Winnie. It's all right.
no, I'll-I'll walk... I'll run after. - What are you talking about?
it's too heavy for the horse. - Run after a cab? I've never heard of such a thing.
don't you let him, Winnie. He'll get lost.
I'll tell Mr. Verloc, Stevie. He'll be ever so unhappy.
you been drinking?
and don't you go for trying that again.
poor horse. - Never mind the horse.
how'd you like to sit up here at 2: 00 in the morning, hey?
see, I'm a night cabbie.
gotta take what they bloody well give me.
hanging out with all sorts in the middle of the night.
wife and four kids to keep.
it's a hard world.
it's bad. It's very bad.
hard on horses? Yeah, a damn sight harder...
on poor bleeders like me.
you can come in my bed if you like.
and your horse as well. I'll ask Winnie.
I-I'm doing this for Stevie.
I wanted to be sure that he'd be safe.
it's the same reason that you married Mr. Verloc, if the truth be known.
what do you mean? - Well, don't tell me you didn't prefer that butcher's boy.
what was his name? Ron?
nice-looking boy. Liked to laugh.
no. You wanted somebody who'd take care of Stevie.
Mr. Verloc's always liked Stevie.
Yeah, but he can be a bit of a burden at times.
and now I'm getting on a bit, I was afraid I might be as well.
no. - Well...
the best of men can get tired, dear.
I didn't want him to get tired of Stevie.
he'd have to get tired of me first.
you will come and see me, won't you, Winnie, as often as you can?
course I will.
I want to see you every Sunday.
I'll come when I can manage, and when I can't, I'll send you Stevie.
No! No, don't let him come on his own.
he gonna change buses and get lost.
you leave it to me. I'll... I'll work out something.
better go in, Mother.
you'll catch cold out here.
and you look after me on the way home. Help me into the bus.
mustn't be nervous, Winnie. I'll look after you.
it's a hard world, Winnie. - That's true enough.
hard on horses and for poor people.
nobody can do anything about that, Stevie.
Yes. Police.
that's not what the police are there for.
then... Then what are they there for, Winnie?
the police are there so's them as have nothing...
can't take nothing away from them as have a lot.
Oh.
what... What can they do if they're poor and hungry?
mustn't worry about it, Stevie.
things don't stand much looking into.
long as you and me love each other, Stevie, that's the important thing.
um... And Mr. Verloc... Does he love me?
course he does, Stevie!
he's a good man, Mr. Verloc.
go on. Get up! Get up!
takings very small today.
that's the least of my worries.
I've been called to a meeting tomorrow.
at the Russian embassy.
it can't be anything good.
come to bed. - Mmm.
I thought I was never gonna get rid of them tonight.
all those wretches.
Mr. Michaelis is a nice man.
he can afford to be.
he's found that old duchess or whatever she is to support him.
and Ossipon?
he'll want for nothing.
as long as there are silly girls in the world with savings bankbooks.
that boy isn't fit to hear what's said here.
he doesn't know any better. Thinks it's all true. - Mmm.
it's bad enough him having to get used to Mother being gone.
what did she want to go and do that for?
perhaps it's just as well.
he's such a good boy.
I couldn't do without him.
would you like to...
or shall I put the light out?
Yeah.
put the light out.
Ah, yes.
you stole us the plans of the breech-block off their field gun, did you not?
I did.
how much did you get for that?
five years' hard labor. - That'll teach you to get caught.
sit down.
now, you purport to be a desperate...
socialist or anarchist, am I right?
anarchist. - Very corpulent for an anarchist, aren't you?
what's that? - "Overweight anarchist..."
seems to me to be something of a contradiction in terms.
how long have you been drawing pay from this embassy?
eleven years.
I've read all the reports you sent us last year...
and I must say...
I'm at a loss to understand why you wrote them at all.
only three months ago, I sent you warning of a plan to assassinate the grand duke...
on his visit to Paris!
the French police assure us your information was exaggerated and inaccurate.
and don't shout.
the Secret Service is, by its nature, difficult to describe.
but I can certainly tell you something it is not.
it is not a philanthropic institution.
you are supposed to be agent provocateur.
I cannot think what you have provoked.
except for my irritation.
I brought you in to tell you that from now on, I expect you to start earning your money.
the good times are over.
no work, no pay.
you summoned me here with a most peremptory letter.
this is only the third time I have been here in 11 years...
and the first time I've arrived...
through the front door in broad daylight!
you seem to have no regard for my safety whatsoever.
your safety is your affair.
if I were seen coming here, it would destroy my usefulness.
if you cease to be useful...
let me assure you of this... You shall be chucked.
I take it you know about the international conference in Milan.
I read the newspapers.
then you will have observed...
that the debate on the suppression of international terrorism...
has been entirely inconclusive.
the British government in particular is reluctant...
to abandon its absurd and sentimental policy...
of offering asylum to so-called political refugees.
your damned friends have only to fill in an application.
it means I can keep them all under my eye.
more to the point, I want them under lock and key.
I want them handed back to us so that we can deal with them properly.
the absence of a system...
of a rational repression in this country is a scandal.
I have decided that this is...
the correct psychological moment...
to instigate such a repression.
this is why I've sent for you.
what I want is a series of outrages.
not necessarily sanguinary. I'm not a butcher.
but startling.
an attack, for example...
upon the fetish of the hour.
now, what do you suppose that that might be?
well, I don't know.
then pay attention.
I will try not to talk above your head.
the class we're trying to attack is very difficult to shock.
conventional assassination...
they take in their stride.
a bomb in the National Gallery would create some effect...
but principally among artists and art critics.
people of no account.
no, the sacrosanct fetish of the hour is science.
science?
unfortunately, it is not possible to throw a bomb into pure mathematics.
and of course, the details of the enterprise...
I leave entirely to you.
but I do have a suggestion.
I thought you might.
Yes.
what do you say...
about having a go at astronomy?
astronomy?
everyone has heard of Greenwich...
even the bootblacks in Charing Cross Station.
nobody actually understands what it is, this new Greenwich Mean Time...
but it has a mystical significance.
the first meridian.
an attack upon time itself.
entirely gratuitous and wonderfully inexplicable.
if that doesn't stir the authorities in this country...
out of their cretinous torpor, I don't know what will.
it'll cost money. - Oh, no.
that cock won't fight. You'll get your usual screw...
and if something doesn't happen very soon, you won't even get that.
do I make myself clear?
is that all?
the Milan conference reconvenes in a month.
unless you provide us before that time with a dynamite outrage...
your connection with us is at an end.
and now you may go.
the first meridian, Mr. Verloc.
go for the first meridian.
bad day? - Atrocious.
he'd do anything for you, that boy.
Adolf.
what are you thinking about?
emigrating.
what? - To France or California.
I couldn't do that.
you'd have to go by yourself.
and you couldn't do without me.
could you?
no.
I couldn't.
Stevie? Are you all right?
he's moping up there on the landing again.
it's all along with Mother leaving.
Mmm. I'm going out.
why don't you take him with you?
I can't.
fresh air would do him good.
go get your coat.
I had a letter from Michaelis today.
did you?
his duchess has given him the use of a country cottage...
to finish his book, if you please.
and he's offered to, uh, put up Stevie for a few days.
that's nice of him.
but you couldn't do without him, could you?
of course I could.
if it were somewhere he wanted to go, why not?
I'll take him down, then.
good-bye, darling.
I love you, Winn.
off you go.
like father and son.
do you give your stuff to anybody who wants it?
I never refuse anyone. I make it an absolute rule.
as long as I have a little pinch left for myself.
and you think this is a sound principle? - Perfectly.
you mean, uh, you'd sell to the police?
they'd leave me alone.
couldn't they arrest you if they wanted to?
what for? - "What for"?
dealing in explosives without a license.
Oh, it's very well known to the police...
that I never part with the final handful of my wares.
I carry it right here, next to my heart.
what if six policemen jump on you in the street?
in my left pocket, I carry an India-rubber bulb.
I always walk with my hand closed around it.
if I squeeze it, it activates the detonator.
works on the same principle as the shutter of a camera lens.
Instantaneous? - No. Unfortunately not.
I estimate 10 seconds will elapse between applying pressure and the explosion.
ten seconds?
that's a lifetime.
I'm working on it.
I'm trying to invent a detonator that would adjust itself to all conditions...
without loss of reliability.
a perfectly precise mechanism. A really intelligent detonator.
this one's not so bad, though.
see that couple going up the stairs?
this would finish them. And everyone else in the room.
character. You see?
that's all that counts... force of personality.
suppose you meet a policeman of character?
be a character based on conventional morality, dependent on life.
in other words, inhibited. Infinitely vulnerable.
I rely on something which knows no restraint...
which cannot be attacked... death.
I've never understood what it is you want.
just one thing...
a perfect detonator.
more. - Right away, sir.
it's a precise aim. Unlike you, with your delegations...
your committees, your revolutions.
which are simply a mirror image of the society you pretend to despise.
here we are, sir.
did you know there was, um, a man blown up in Greenwich Park this morning?
no. - Huge explosion.
fragments of body everywhere. Here you are.
the usual newspaper gup.
criminal stupidity.
I don't know what you mean by " criminal " .
what everybody else means.
I mean, something like this is very dangerous for people in our position.
and you tell me you are giving your stuff away to any fool who comes to you.
both hands. Freely.
cause what's needed is a clean sweep.
I don't give a damn about consequences.
can you describe the person you gave the explosives to?
describe him?
Yes. I can describe him in one word... Verloc.
Verloc?
he said he wanted it for some kind of demonstration against a building.
and he wanted to be able to carry it in public without arousing suspicion.
so I cut the bottom out of an old one-gallon copal varnish can.
afterwards, I re-soldered it.
I put the detonator in the screw cap.
what do you suppose happened?
I don't know.
once you tighten the cap and make the connection...
gives you 20 minutes.
it also becomes extremely volatile.
so, either he let the time run too close or he let it fall.
I can't imagine what came over Verloc.
he was a nobody.
a quite ordinary personality.
useful, but no more. Married, even.
ran a shop, which I imagine...
his wife started for him.
he didn't tell you why?
I didn't ask.
I don't know what I should do.
what you usually do, I imagine.
fasten yourself to the woman for all she's worth.
well, well, well.
chief Inspector Heat. - It's all right. I'm not looking for you.
not this time. When I am, I shall know where to find you.
and I'm sure your obituary will be more flattering than you deserve.
also, however conscientiously your friends may try and sort us out...
I'm afraid some of you may end up being buried with some of me.
this sort of stuff is all very well for frightening children.
no time like the present.
you'll never have a more favorable opportunity for making a humane arrest.
it's just you and me.
not even a cat around.
surely that's a worthwhile self-sacrifice for a public servant.
you'd do it if you knew how cruelly tempted I am every time I walk in a crowd.
if I was to grab you now...
I'd be no better than you.
you'll never get me so cheap.
I don't know what your game is. I don't expect you know yourself.
you're really famous for not understanding our game.
well, whatever it is, give it up.
you'll find we're too many for you.
good job you people always make such a mess of things.
if a burglar was that incompetent, he'd starve.
better at my work than you are.
that's quite enough of that.
lunatic.
good day.
evening.
please make yourself comfortable, Chief Inspector.
thank you, sir.
sit down.
a couple of weeks ago, you assured me there was no prospect whatsoever...
of any outbreak of anarchist activity.
I passed this on to the home secretary. He was extremely pleased.
he smiled at me.
I wonder if you can imagine how annoying I find the memory of that smile.
none of our lot had anything to do with this, sir.
tell me what you discovered in Greenwich.
our man arrived at Maze Hill station at 11: 08 on the Gravesend train.
short, stocky fellow. He was carrying a tin can.
as a matter of fact, there was two of them.
they'd come from a place called Aldington, near Hythe.
an old woman saw them making their way towards the observatory.
the explosion happened about 10 minutes later.
a constable heard it. He was on the scene within a minute or two.
what evidence do you have that it was the same people?
strips of yellow tin in the vicinity.
only one of them was killed.
how do you know? - Bits and pieces only added up to one body.
couldn't identify him, but he had the right number of everything.
good deal of him they had to scrape up with a spade.
nice treat for the coroner's jury.
filthy weather.
the home secretary said he'd been told we were very efficient.
and what we seemed most efficient at was making him look a fool.
there is one what you might call chink of light, sir.
this place in Kent. Aldington, near Hythe. - Yes?
odd sort of place of origin for two ruthless terrorists, wouldn't you say?
not if you happen to know that not more than a mile away, there is a cottage...
occupied at present by the ex-convict, Michaelis.
I thought you just told me our anarchists had nothing to do with this affair.
doesn't mean we can't issue a charge if we feel like it, sir.
you'll need some pretty conclusive evidence.
I don't think that'd be too difficult, sir.
I can look after that. Trust me for that.
man like that has no business being out of prison, if you ask me.
none of them do. I tell you, sir.
makes me long for the days when I was catching good, honest thieves.
at least you know where you are with thieves.
bit of mutual respect. At least they're normal.
I believe you're hiding something from me, Chief Inspector.
what is it?
something with regards to Michaelis, sir?
no. What's puzzling me, in fact...
is your eagerness to shunt the whole train off into a siding marked Michaelis.
so you'd better tell me what else you've discovered.
as a matter of fact, there was another matter...
I'd intended to draw to your attention in due course.
I found an address. - An address?
that's right, sir. On the corpse. - What address?
32 Brett Street. It's a shop. - What kind of shop?
the kind of shop you might expect to find in Soho, sir.
who runs this shop?
a man who, from time to time...
I have occasion to make use of.
does he have a name, this paragon?
Verloc.
a personal friend of mine in the French police tipped me the wink...
that he was a secret agent in the pay of the Russian embassy.
so I called on him one evening, told him who I was.
he didn't bat an eyelid. Said he was a married man and didn't want any trouble.
so we came to an arrangement.
describe it.
I had a word with the customs people...
made sure they wouldn't interfere with any of his shipments...
and in return, I'm able to consult him whenever I think there's something in the wind.
and how long has this been going on? - Seven years.
no wonder your reputation for omniscience is so established.
so, in other words...
you would rather throw an innocent man to the lions...
than dispense with the services of so useful an informant.
I would hardly describe Michaelis as an innocent man, sir.
even though I know he enjoys a number of influential friends, sir.
if you mean the duchess of...
isn't she a particular friend of your wife, sir?
as to that, the first secretary at the Russian embassy is a member of my club.
and I may say, it's most improper of you to try finessing with me in this way.
this Verloc is a spy in the pay of a foreign embassy.
I don't feel disposed to overlook that fact...
just because he may privately be of service to you.
it's my opinion he knows nothing at all of this business.
then how do you account for the address?
I don't account for it.
you see, I begin to see this as a heaven-sent opportunity...
to deal with a whole gang of spies...
agents provocateur, and all kinds of political riffraff.
you may go.
report to me here at 9: 00 tomorrow morning.
as you please, sir.
Harold! Just the man I was hoping to run across.
how are you? - Will you take a drink with me?
unfortunately, I have an errand to run.
busy day, huh? With this outrage in Greenwich Park?
just so. - I have said this before... I cannot understand...
why your government is so indulgent towards these terrorists.
perhaps it is because you're not so cruelly affected as we are in my country.
we're on the track of a man called Verloc.
what? - I understand you know him.
what makes you think that?
he has no secrets from us.
a lying dog of some kind.
this may well be the breakthrough we've been waiting for.
what do you mean? - In our campaign to clear out of this country...
the despicable scum that use embassies as a cover for their criminal activities.
I have an appointment.
I believe I've heard you complain of the inefficiency of our police.
but within eight hours of this explosion, we seem to have established...
not only the perpetrator but even the instigator behind him.
not bad, wouldn't you say?
aren't you impressed?
Where's your umbrella?
I must have left it somewhere.
have you been down to see Stevie? - No, no.
you've let yourself get soaked through.
I'll... I'll... I'll be all right.
you'll be laid up with a cold, next thing.
no, I'll be all right.
I'll get the tea on.
where you been all day, anyway?
nowhere.
I... d-did go to the bank.
what for?
to draw out the money.
all of it?
Yeah. All of it.
Why?
I thought I might need it.
I don't understand.
you can trust me.
you know that, don't you?
Oh, yes. I trust you.
if I hadn't trusted you...
I wouldn't have married you.
you're all right with me.
not tired of me yet?
shop, Adolf. - What? What?
you'd better go.
are you feeling all right?
I find I have to go out this evening.
you over from the continent?
you do understand English.
Oh, yes. I understand English.
did you know Mr. Verloc in France, perhaps?
I've heard of him.
Adolf.
you're not going out with all that money on you? - Money?
Oh. Yes.
no.
you know that man? - I've... I've heard of him.
he's not one of those embassy people you were talking about?
embassy people?
I could cut their heart out as soon as look at them.
get rid of him as quick as you can and come back home to me.
you want looking after.
I can only help you if you tell me everything.
you understand that, don't you? - I'll tell you everything.
husband in by any chance, Mrs. Verloc?
no. He's gone out. - I wanted a word with him.
I'd wait if I thought he wasn't going to be too long.
any idea where he's gone?
he didn't say.
I think you know who I am. I'm a policeman. You know that.
I try not to bother my head about these things.
my name is Heat...
chief Inspector Heat...
of the Special Crimes Department.
Oh, yes?
so, your husband didn't say when he'll be back?
he's out with someone.
friend? - No. Just someone who called.
would you mind telling me what this "someone" looked like?
tall, thin fellow.
sort of foreign-looking.
damn it. I thought as much.
in that case, I think I won't wait for your husband.
you're very calm...
but I expect you could give me a pretty good idea about what's going on if you felt like it.
what is going on?
there's something else.
a small matter. Perhaps you might be able to help us.
yes?
we've come into possession of...
of what we believe might be a stolen overcoat.
we're not missing an overcoat.
in the overcoat, there is a label...
with this address written in purple marking ink.
well, that must be my brother's. - Could I have a word with him?
he's not here. - Where is he?
staying with a friend in the country.
has he got a name, this friend? - Michaelis.
Oh!
excellent. Yes.
now we're talking.
so, Michaelis had nothing whatever to do with this affair?
no.
it was just that Stevie, my brother-in-law...
he was staying at his house in the country.
I collected him about 8: 00 this morning.
told Michaelis I'd bring him back tonight.
we took the train to Maze Hill.
arrived, I don't know, about 11: 00.
in the park...
I primed the bomb...
and sent him off with it.
I was fond of him, you know?
I was really fond of that boy.
I'm sorry.
appalling place you've brought me to.
serves very well for the refugees they send me over from the continent.
I suppose it's a question of what you're used to.
all right. Let's get down to business, shall we?
you see, it strikes me, Mrs. Verloc...
that you probably know more about this bomb business than you're aware of.
what bomb business? I don't know what you're talking about.
bomb went off this morning in Greenwich Park...
by accident, most like, since one of the perpetrators was blown to bits.
and I have reason to suppose that your husband...
might be able to help me with my inquiries, that's all.
Adolf would never get mixed up in anything like this.
I know that.
it's just information I'm after.
and you're quite sure he hasn't spoken to you about it?
I take it you can identify this?
Yes.
your brother...
is he in the habit of going about labeled?
he sometimes gets a bit confused.
so I made that label and sewed it in for him.
he's all right.
there's nothing wrong with him.
it's just sometimes he likes to go see his mother on his own, and I...
I like to be on the safe side.
is he a short, stocky fellow?
no.
he's tall and fair.
I don't understand. That label, whatever did you tear it out for?
what do you want?
a word or two.
you'd better come upstairs, then.
took a little while for the penny to drop.
it was only while I was talking with your wife just now...
that I realized you must be the other man.
you gonna take me in?
I know who you've just been talking to.
it's his case now.
but I'm the one who traced you. Make no mistake about that.
how?
take a look at that.
what's she wanna try a dodge like that for?
made you an offer, did he?
he says if I cooperate fully, I'll get two years, maximum.
promises are easy.
if I was you, I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him.
I've gotta trust somebody.
what you gonna tell them?
everything.
you know me. I'm always straight.
that's why I've been so useful to you.
lot of useful things this is gonna put a stop to.
see, he was simple.
that was the trouble.
we went over it all I don't know how many times.
it couldn't have been easier.
I was just standing there, waiting.
then you heard the bang.
came too soon, you see.
that's when I knew he'd gone.
Oh.
I don't know what could have happened.
we've been able to piece it together, more or less.
looks like he stumbled over a root.
you're right about him being gone. His head and feet were still there.
the rest of him, they had to scrape up with a shovel.
couldn't you take me in tonight? I'd come quietly.
I daresay. But by tomorrow morning, this isn't gonna be my case anymore.
thanks to your new friend.
jail's the only safe place for me.
they'll all be looking for me now.
if I'm not careful, I'm liable to end up with a knife in me back.
you want my advice? Private advice from Private Citizen Heat?
clear out. Vanish.
we won't chase after you. I can see to that.
neither will your people. They all think you're dead already.
how do you know?
I'd say they'd make a logical assumption that it was your guts...
spread all over Greenwich Park, wouldn't you?
he's a good man, Mr. Verloc.
I never meant any harm to come to the boy.
you know that.
I... I couldn't think how I was gonna break it to ya.
I sat for hours in the Cheshire Cheese worrying me head off.
it can't be helped, Winnie. What's done can't be undone.
look, you want to look at a fellow?
I never want to look at you again as long as I live.
come on, Winnie. Be reasonable. This won't bring him back!
well, supposing it had been me you'd lost. Where would you be then?
you know I don't like to worry you.
well, so I...
I didn't tell you what a spot this embassy bastard had put me in!
eleven years I've worked for him. I've risked my life I don't know how many times.
there's scores of those revolutionists I've sent off to be caught red-handed.
the highest in the world has got me to thank for still walking on their two legs!
then this new swine turns up.
ignorant.
overbearing. Thinks he knows it all.
I should've taken him by the throat...
and rammed his head up that embassy chimney!
I'm sorry, hon. I haven't eaten all day.
I could've done too.
they wouldn't have dared call the police. You know what I mean?
I love you, Winn.
you're gonna have to pull yourself together sooner or later, my girl.
perhaps you ought to go to bed.
what you need is a good cry.
I thought you were like father and son.
what?
but you were just taking him away from me to murder him.
Oh, now, hang on. - And there was I, sure you'd come home with a cold.
no, no, listen. I was upset! I was upset about you!
and the boy, of course.
listen, Winnie.
we're gonna have to make plans.
do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm gonna have to get away.
and you're gonna need to be extra careful.
they're gonna be watching you all the time.
you're gonna be on your own... for a while.
till the right moment.
then you can slip away and join me.
abroad? - Yeah, course abroad.
I don't want to make it easy for them to catch up with me and do me in.
I think too much of you for that.
what about Ste...
where you going? Upstairs?
that's right.
a bit of rest and quiet.
won't be long before I join you.
look at the time, Winnie.
your mother'll be dead before you get there. Show a bit of sense.
look, I don't want to make a point of this...
but you're the one who brought the police here by sewing in that label without telling me.
now, take off your hat.
I can't do without you this evening. Come on.
sit down.
Oh, take the damn thing off!
that's more like it.
the boy's gone.
you think I wanted him to blow himself up?
it was an accident.
just as much as if he was run over by a bus.
you're the one who kept pushing him my way, telling me to take him out for walks.
if you look at it that way...
you're just as responsible for his death as I am!
I wish to goodness I'd never laid eyes on Greenwich Park.
Winnie...
Winnie... - Yes.
I know what'd do you good.
come over here.
come on.
don't.
Aah!
I never wanted you.
all I ever wanted was somewhere safe for Stevie.
what?
mysterious Suicide of Lady passenger from Cross-Channel Ferry
Mrs. Verloc.
Mr. Ossipon. - I was on my way to see you.
you were? - Yes.
where are we going? - Will you help me?
can't you take me away? Out of the country tonight?
I don't think there is a train till the morning.
well, isn't there somewhere you can hide me?
no. I can't take you back to my lodgings. - Somewhere else, then?
but I-I have no money on me, you know?
we anarchists are not very rich. - I have money.
how much? - All the money.
what do you mean? - All the money he had in the bank.
then we are saved.
what's the matter with you?
don't understand why you look so morose.
I'd heard you'd come into a little legacy.
do you want it? - What?
the legacy. You can have it, all of it.
so send off tomorrow for certain chemicals, things that I need.
if this is all right, I'll pass the bill to you.
whatever you like.
wait. There is a midnight ferry from Southampton to Saint-Malo.
10: 30 from Waterloo, I think. - Can we go back to the shop?
the shop? What... - I packed a case.
well, all right.
it's upstairs on the floor.
Aah!
a policeman... He spotted me. - What?
if he comes in, kill me.
they'd hang me, Tom. I can't bear the thought.
did you do that? - He killed my boy.
Oh, my God. It was the degenerate in the park.
my Stevie. - Oh, my God.
the money's upstairs? - No, it's on me.
let's get out of here, or we'll miss the train.
you'd better let me have the money. - Yes, Tom.
wait here.
yes?
yes?
we should keep apart until the train leaves.
another one.
I tipped the guard, so we'll have the compartment to ourselves.
you think of everything.
extraordinary boy, that brother of yours.
you were the only one that took any notice of him, Tom.
I loved you for it.
safe journey.
if I didn't know you better, Ossipon, I'd conclude that you're in the throes of remorse.
pull yourself together. Remorse is for the weak.
and weakness is the source of all evil on this earth.
there's a time coming, and it's gonna be sooner rather than later...
when this'll be understood by governments as well as individuals...
that there can be no progress and no solutions...
until you make a rational decision to exterminate the weak.
I myself have no future.
but I am a force.
to the destruction of what is.
what is that?
a power totem.
draws away weakness to intensify your strength.
put this under your bed for a few weeks, and you'll be left with nothing but pure power.
I'm Eva, Lee's girlfriend.
you told me the devil's crack destroyed her.
but then she got better and came back here.
look, Faye, it's complicated.
I came back from the dead for you.
you can't just dump me.
my name is Calvin Wilson.
you're in danger. Remember this?
I had a feeling you'd try to be a hero.
my son and your daughter are written in the stars.
written in the stars isn't just destiny.
it's a curse.
what?
you're just so beautiful.
you wanna do some circle magic and try and stop time?
mm, well, that's tempting.
but then we'd be stuck in this bed forever.
we'd find something to do.
I keep thinking about the first time we did magic together...
how it felt when you touched my hand.
I know.
then after that, I just couldn't stop thinking about you...
about...
this.
so how's the real thing working for you?
my dark magic did this?
not your magic, you and Adam.
us?
how. It's not like we were sitting around, casting dead bird spells.
no, I suspect you two were engaged in other activities.
Oh, God.
how could we have anything to do with this?
what you did unleashed a curse.
what curse?
the one placed on your 2 families a long time ago to stop the Blakes and the Conants from ever being together.
that's crazy.
why do you think this?
your mother told me about it.
the birds are a harbinger, a sign that the curse has been activated.
you don't believe this is true, right?
I...I don't know.
there's a hundred dead birds on my lawn.
OK, but then why... why would my dad make such a big deal about our destiny being connected, written in the stars?
maybe she didn't tell him.
I don't know the details of the curse, just that it scared your mother enough to drive her away.
the only other person she would have confided in is your grandmother.
my grandmother, she's not in good shape.
well, we have to try.
sooner we talk to her, the better, and in the meantime...
don't do anything to make it worse.
lee is out.
what are you doing here?
I have a key, so I'm not breaking and entering like you are.
did he talk to you yet?
he said he was struggling with his feelings and needed time to think, and then he just took off.
that's not what he said last night.
and since when does Lee think?
guess you didn't know him as well as you thought.
can you just go now?
I'd like to be alone.
what are you doing?
I said go!
what the hell?
you are seriously psycho.
she threw it at my head.
the girl has serious anger issues.
which girl?
Faye had a run-in with Eva.
she almost killed me.
she claims Lee left town, but I think she did something to him.
guy got stuck in between you and his ex at casino night.
you know, maybe he just bailed.
then why is his car still there?
he took a cab? - No way.
he worships that car.
he thinks it makes him look badass.
we need to search it.
that's illegal, Faye.
not if we don't get caught.
are you sure this is about Eva?
what did I just say? - It's just...
we both know how obsessed you can get about a guy.
maybe you're overreacting.
you weren't there, Melissa.
Eva was hiding something from me behind those doll eyes and creepy voice.
when do I ever ask you two for help?
grandma.
no, it's Cassie, remember?
Oh, of course, sweetheart.
honestly, Amelia, why would you bring him here?
come on. Let's go sit.
I...I wanted to ask you something important about the Conants and the Blakes...
and a curse.
why do you keep torturing yourself about this?
I wish you would reconsider and tell Ethan.
it's too dangerous not to.
it's just I don't remember all the details.
several generations ago, a seer witch cursed the Conants and the Blakes to stop them from ever coming together.
Why? Why would someone do that?
jealousy.
and what if a Conant and a Blake did get together?
please tell me you and Ethan didn't.
no. Uh...
but what if we did?
then you would awaken the curse, and you can never let that happen.
Why?
because if you awaken the curse, someone in your circle will die.
who'd you piss off now?
it was before our time.
a witch put a curse on our families.
what kind of curse?
apparently to keep our families from coming together.
last night, we activated it.
so you two finally graduated from hand-holding and smooching.
Congrats.
what does that mean for any of us?
it affects the whole circle.
how? - My grandmother said that one of us might die.
no offense, but the last time I saw your grandma, she was a little...
Faye. This is no joke.
I have been feeling kind of tired.
I wasn't feeling that great this morning.
Uh-uh. No one is dying.
it's just a story your great-greats told their kids so they wouldn't have sex.
it's abstinence education at work.
are you two coming?
she's dealing with psycho-ex drama.
Faye's right. No one's dying.
I still haven't heard from Jake.
I was knocking.
have you been in bed all day?
I think I'm coming down with something.
what is that?
I have no idea.
what?
we need to talk.
if a Blake and a Conant...
if a Blake and a Conant what?
uh...
how am I dragged into this?
the curse is someone in the circle could die.
took a curse to figure out being with Adam was a colossal mistake?
Hey. I think I found the way to fix this.
I think this'll break the curse.
if she had an elixir, why didn't she use it?
I don't know. - Who cares?
let's just do it.
these are rare ingredients.
owns an antiquities shop.
we must have something at the abandoned house.
my brother grew a lot of weird plants.
I think Calvin's our best option.
not even a thank-you card.
John Blackwell is alive and well and strutting around Chance Harbor.
Really?
you're not surprised.
well, I always had a nagging suspicion that his death was too good to be true.
well, we need to deal with it.
do we?
it took you a week to tell me that John Blackwell had arisen from the dead, and I wouldn't be standing here unless you needed something, so what's wrong, Dawn?
this homecoming didn't go as well as you'd always dreamed?
I got a call from my source at the Landsdown Clinic.
Jane had a visitor today, Blackwell.
if Jane starts remembering things, it won't take him long to connect us to her and Henry.
now, we are so close to getting our power back, but we need him on our side.
let's not forget who killed Amelia.
and if John figures that out, not even your precious little crystal will stop him from destroying you.
Hello?
we're here to see Calvin.
my Uncle's not here.
do you know when he's going to be back?
he's been missing for months.
I'm sorry to hear that.
but I'm sure I can help you.
this is what we need.
come with me.
we have everything but lethe root.
it's very rare.
does it grow around here?
used to, in Harbor Woods.
might still be able to still find some if you, uh, go deep enough.
all right.
Cassie and I will go.
I-I'll go with you.
I really want to make sure that we find this root.
are you sure that's a good idea?
if only you'd asked yourself that last night.
let it go.
well?
you coming or what?
this is his.
are you sure Eva's not home?
you know what? I don't care.
let's check the trunk.
that's where people hide dead bodies, right?
lock, unlock.
see? Just a bunch of voodoo stuff.
I don't think that's Lee.
so can we go now?
I need to check inside.
bloody gloves, tools...
bet this car's filled with clues.
Oh, guys, guys.
don't say or do anything stupid.
like break into a car?
Hello, officer.
ladies, is this your car?
it's mine. It's mine.
OK. Let's see some registration.
we can explain. Uh...
officer, do you mind if I talk to you, um, privately?
what is she doing?
landing us in jail.
we just kind of brought her here for some closure.
why isn't she using the sexy card?
She's...she's not psycho or anything.
I mean, everything's gonna be fine.
maybe she needs a push.
but actually he didn't even lock the car, so technically we didn't even break in.
what were you thinking?
it was Melissa's idea.
I'm sorry. I thought it would work.
do you want to lock-unlock our way out of here?
at least we know that works.
and then what?
he's not gonna shoot us.
I don't think.
just when I think it can't get any worse.
OK, ladies. You can go.
thank you.
Yeah, thanks.
don't worry about it.
Faye and I both care about Lee.
I understand how upset she feels.
he wouldn't just leave his car here.
he took his motorcycle.
I forgot about his motorcycle.
we're sorry for bothering you.
we'll leave you alone now, right, Faye?
you two as cold as I am?
Yes. - Yes.
maybe we're all dying.
you know, you can still go back to town.
we don't mind at all.
and miss out on this amazing bonding opportunity? No.
so tell me, how was your first time?
was it sweet and romantic,
I don't care if you're sick.
no thanks to you, buddy. - Stop it.
why are you doing this?
just trying to make conversation.
you're jealous.
you're wrong.
I know you don't believe that.
guys, let's go.
hold on. I need some water.
what the hell?
what? What's wrong now?
this.
it's a witch cruet.
who put this in my bag?!
what are you talking about?
did you get this from Calvin's?!
is this some kind of a sick joke?!
I'm not a witch hunter anymore!
this is not a witch cruet.
he's losing it.
Oh, he's burning up.
we have to hurry.
just a minute.
young lady, do you really want a job?
Hello, Jane.
Yes, I do. I do very much.
it's Dawn and Charles. You remember us?
you're Amelia's friends.
Yes. That's right.
Amelia's not here.
she'll be back anytime.
thank you, Jane, but we actually came to see you.
that should do it.
Jane, you had a visitor today, John Blackwell.
Yes.
what did you and John talk about?
he doesn't look good.
what?
it's just last night was so amazing.
I can't believe something so horrible happened because of us.
it's not our fault.
blame the witch who cursed our families.
you ok, Jake?
I'm fine.
murderer.
shut up. Shut up.
you killed me, Jake.
now I'll watch you die.
you stay away from me, Calvin.
what? It's me, Adam.
you turned me to ash.
now you're going to burn.
I was just doing what the witch hunters told me to do.
you enjoyed it. You're a killer.
I had no choice!
stop it!
I had no choice!
No!
Cassie, Cassie, no!
Cassie, no!
no dark magic!
focus on me. Look at me.
are you ok?
Yeah. Are you?
Yeah.
he thought I was Calvin Wilson.
I know.
Jake killed him.
is this what you're looking for?
it's perfect. Thank you.
I'm impressed you get costus root to grow in this climate.
I put a UV light on it at night.
good instincts.
Nick showed me a few things.
I guess I'm a fast learner.
OK, I'm gonna need some ash to strengthen this.
I'll get some from the fireplace.
Thanks.
you know, a coffee grinder would be a lot faster.
very creative...
like your mother.
I didn't realize you knew her that well.
Oh, yeah, we spent hours in these woods.
she showed me all the plants with medicinal properties, and...
you meant the world to her.
got it.
looks like you'll live, Jake.
dealing with Jake's past was easier when I didn't know it, but I knew Calvin.
Calvin was trying to help me when Jake killed him.
you're not the reason he's dead, Cassie.
that's on Jake.
thank you.
you know, for bringing me back before I hurt Jake...
more.
using dark power is getting too easy.
but you stopped...
and that's because you and me are stronger than dark magic or any of this.
bitch.
get away from that.
nice bike.
is this the one Lee rode out of town on?
fine. You don't want to talk to me, let's get that cop back here.
No!
you have magic.
are you a witch? - No.
what did Lee do to you?
he brought me back from the brink of death.
what don't you get about that?
what's wrong with you?
he gave you my power.
not everything is about you.
this is, I swear.
lee used 2 voodoo totems...
one to take my power, and one to save you...
but then he broke my totem, and he messed everything up.
so this is your power?
Yes, and you're not supposed to have it.
this is all Lee's fault.
that's why he ran.
you're a witch?
Yes.
then maybe you can help me make things right.
Absolutely.
I did something with your magic.
but if I used your power to do it, you can help me bring him back.
you killed him.
with your magic, so fix him.
I can't. - Why not?
he's dead!
you're a witch. Do a spell.
bring him back to life.
I'm not God, Eva.
I can't just make someone live.
I unlock locks, and I cheat at cards, and I get hot pizza guys, and I can't even do any of that without someone helping me.
you're lying. - I'm not.
what you're asking for is impossible.
I didn't ask for any of this.
I don't want your magic.
I just want Lee back.
I'm sorry, but he's gone.
what are you doing?
stop!
stop.
stop it!
then help me bring back Lee.
OK. Ok.
I can't guarantee this is gonna save him.
thank you for your guidance, for everything.
there's something you need to know.
OK, we both need to, um...
kneel on either side of Lee's body.
are you sure this is gonna work?
you said it was impossible.
that was just my lack of self-confidence talking, but I gave myself a quick pep talk, and I'm feeling much better now, so let's...
raise the dead.
are you messing with me?
Eva, I'm a very, very powerful witch.
you should know that better than anyone.
you've got my power coursing through your veins.
ready?
place your hands on the bed...
and concentrate.
close your eyes.
I need you to chant with me.
if you don't say it right, it'll never work.
wait.
I completely forgot.
candles.
we need candles. Do you have any?
do you want to save Lee or not?
you lying bitch.
there is no spell, is there?
all you wanted was this.
this is all your fault.
lee would still be alive if he hadn't met you.
what am I doing?
what do you think you're doing?
I don't know.
I can't feel the power anymore.
that's a good thing.
trust me.
I didn't mean to kill Lee.
I loved him so much.
is that it?
Yeah.
well, let's give it to him and go.
it's not for Jake.
it's for us.
because we're at the heart of the curse, we're the ones who have to drink it.
what?
there's more.
that lethe root, when we drink this, we'll forget how we feel about each other.
there's no way. No.
no, we'll remember everything, even that we loved each other.
we just won't remember why, and we won't be in love.
that's crazy. I'm not gonna do it.
there's no other way to break the curse.
Oh, so we're gonna destroy us to save a killer.
if we let him die, then we're the killers, we're just like him. No.
Cassie, being with you is more important than anything.
we don't have a choice.
there is no elixir that can ever let me forget how much I love you.
not for long.
I swear.
I know.
you saved my life.
I helped.
was I hallucinating, or did Adam and Cassie just destroy their relationship...
for me?
you don't think you're worth the sacrifice?
I know I'm not.
you're 1 of 6.
you matter.
they don't know me.
I killed Calvin.
well, that's in the past.
I wish it was, but the look on Cassie's face when she found out...
I'm surprised that she didn't let me die.
I understand...
more than you know.
but a man can change.
you really believe that?
I do.
morning.
how do you feel?
weird.
weird how?
like I'm not...
nervous.
nervous? When are you ever nervous?
when I'm around you.
and when I think about you and when I wonder if I'm good enough for you.
I don't feel that way right now.
I feel...
good.
good's good.
look, I love seeing you, love being here, and I definitely want to come back and watch the rest of "Game of Thrones" with you, but I don't, um...
love me.
this is strange.
I guess...guess that elixir worked.
I mean...
do you feel that way, too?
exactly.
I remember every minute we spent together...
but like it was in a movie...
someone else's amazing movie.
that's totally it.
maybe being written in the stars didn't mean what we thought it did.
maybe we're not the dating kind of soul mates.
Yeah.
you were right.
breaking the curse, that was the most important thing.
we saved Jake's life.
I have to open the boathouse.
can we just talk later?
Absolutely.
Bye.
she was so crazy.
and so alone.
I'm so sorry we didn't believe you.
I'm still kind of having trouble believing it.
and yet you still came with me to help break into a car.
Thanks.
I still remember everything.
I still love him.
I'm sorry.
but he doesn't love me.
your power must be too strong.
the elixir only worked on Adam.
you know, I don't feel very strong right now.
sorry. I'm sorry.
I had no idea.
he doesn't love me anymore.
don't worry, Cassie. You're going to be ok.
who knows what might happen between you and Adam?
Yeah.
I, um...
I think...
think I just need to be alone.
of course.
but I won't be far, not ever again.
who are you?
it's me, Jane.
Charles, you scared me.
it's late. What are you doing here?
I'm here to make you better.
I'm here to help you so that you can help me destroy John Blackwell.
I saw Jane Blake today.
how nice for her.
there's no such thing as a Blake-Conant curse.
Amelia would have told me.
you manipulated her with magic, didn't you?
I told you I don't have...
John, I know you still have power, just like I knew you weren't dead.
you scheming son of a bitch.
you're driving Adam and Cassie apart because you're afraid of their destiny...
just like you were afraid of Amelia and Ethan.
Yes, and did you know that Ethan and Amelia's love was so important, they wanted out of the circle?
he left the boat that day to run away with her, and their absence left you totally defenseless against the witch hunters.
that massacre never would have happened had the circle worked together.
so you do have magic.
not enough to protect Cassie if her circle's destroyed.
my magic can fake a curse, kill birds, spell Jane, put Jake through agony, but I can't stop all the witch hunters.
the hunters are back?
and they're using magic, which means one of us is working with them.
I didn't know.
don't question me again, Dawn.
you know you don't want me as an enemy.
you're in love again. Who is it this time?
I had my heart set on Amy and our baby.
where are you going in that getup?
that's what you call this? A getup?
job interview? Must be a case of the nerves, so it is a job interview.
I think we go to the same school, my name's Thomas.
I can get away with anything because my sister's pregnant.
my parent's gave me birth control pills.
your parents let you go on the pill?
I'm not on it, I just have them.
how can I be what's best for the baby?
because you are the best for the baby's mother.
I asked you out, you said, "Yes."
and I wanna go out.
I want you to be careful not to hurt my sister.
she's all I got.
my foster mother, Margaret, she's their social worker.
they took me in when I don't think anyone else would have.
everyone's afraid of older boys.
especially with troubled pasts and crazy drug-addict parents.
you know what? I'm not crazy about an open adoption.
I want our foster kids back.
I don't think that Ricky's ever gonna let us adopt that baby either.
I have no intention of sharing you with Ricky.
so who do you love, Amy?
Oh, boy. Mama's got on her power suit again.
just because you have a pregnant teenage daughter doesn't mean you can be a governor, my lady.
give it up, George.
I am going to get a job, and when I get a job,
I'm gonna proceed with the divorce, and you are going to be moving.
well, I hope it's a really big job, because I wanna get a really big house.
Ooh, the sweet smell of alimony.
Hello? - Hi.
is Ashley there, please?
may I ask who's calling?
don't do that. - Shh!
Thomas. - Thomas?
okay, let me see if I can find her.
Thomas?
Ashley! There's someone on the phone for you!
she can't hear that. - Ashley, phone!
I'm sorry Thomas, but can I have her call you back?
Yes, thank you. - Does she have your number?
I believe she does.
I told you, I can't away with anything right now.
the closer it gets to the baby's arrival, the more invisible I get.
and is that your doing or your family's?
your invisibility? - Mine.
Ashley left a half hour ago. She took the bus.
no one told me.
no one tells me anything around here anymore.
it's lonely at the top, governor.
that's your oldest daughter, Amy.
she's here, and she needs a ride to school.
so, Amy, it's back to looking for a job, huh?
are you talking about you or me?
both of us.
if you don't have a family to adopt the baby, you need to get a job, and without your father, I need to get a job too.
you know, I think we could get some help.
help?
Yeah, u know, from the government?
Amy, don't be ridiculous.
you don't need to get help from the government.
we can take care of ourselves. - Mom.
we can both get a job if we try.
I've been trying, but I can try a little harder.
and Amy, you can try harder too.
honestly, Mom, I don't think I can get a job, and I'm not so sure you could either.
well, I'm sure that we can.
we just need to keep looking.
and while we're looking, we can look for another couple to adopt the baby.
there are plenty of couples out there who are looking to adopt, it's just a matter of finding the right one.
mom, I don't think I can be through that again
I can't believe Donovan and Leon,
well they didn't.
that's how it is.
well, maybe they'll change their minds.
Yeah, and maybe I'll be governor, but in the meantime, we need to find work.
it's not gonna happen.
I'm not qualified to do anything, and I don't know what you're qualified to do.
well, I don't know either, but there's gotta be something.
we just have to be willing to take any job.
any honest job that we can get, because you know it's always easier to get a job when you already have a job.
so we'll just take the first one that comes along and we'll go from there.
mom, I don't want a job.
Amy, Woman up, okay? Come on, let's go.
let's get out there, let's do the right thing.
let's be responsible.
mom, I'm tired.
and I have school, I don't want to be responsible.
did I mention that I'm tired?
I had a short stint as a cocktail waitress.
made pretty good money but I got busted on the age thing.
exactly how old are you, Ashley?
seventeen.
you're in middle school, so you're not 17.
unless you're really, really stupid, and you're not stupid.
I thought you said you went to my school.
no, I saw you got off the bus at your school.
I lied.
now's the time you're supposed to stop staring at me because my staring at you bothers you.
I'm not in middle school, baby.
and I'm fascinated by your lips.
Heh. You're an idiot.
yeah maybe.
I'm home schooled, and my parents are very good teachers.
well, you lucky guy.
how did you get that?
I don't get along well with others.
me neither.
I know, I saw you on the bus.
so I'm just gonna cut to the chase.
can I come over to your house tonight?
I don't know.
how old are you? - Uh, 15.
I'll think about it. Give me your number.
got to be something here. I have more pens.
although I didn't finish college, when I drop out at a 3. 8 average in business management.
and let's face it, as a mom of 16 years, I have tons of experience in handling money and working on a budget and time management.
time management, that's a big one.
I'm really good at that.
and, uh, I'm also a multitasker.
do you speak Spanish?
I speak French.
and a little Greek.
no Spanish?
so no Spainish. - Si.
the cook only speaks Spanish. - I'll learn Spanish.
I love hot dogs, I love working???
I really want this job.
you, with the 3. 8 and the suit, you want this job?
Yeah, I really want this job.
I've been looking for quite a while now and it seems that no one sees my potential.
Oh, I see your potential.
I plan on going back to school, but with this economy it's really hard to find part-time work.
so I figure this could a place as any to start.
I'll work really hard, and I'm totally flexible with my hours.
flexible, huh?
husband leave you?
I wish.
but we are getting a divorce, so I'm reentering the work force, so to speak.
it's not easy. - Not if you don't speak Spanish.
and hey, this is not the work force.
we feed the work force.
how old are you? -You can't ask me that.
you brought up the personal stuff, divorce and all that
how old are you is not a job-interview question, it's a personal question, me to you, man to woman.
then I'm 29.
I've been out with women over 29.
natural redhead? - What?
your hair? Put something on it?
no.
all right then, you're hired.
I like women who don't have a problem with lying.
these, uh
these aren't all-beef hot dogs, you know?
I'll need an assistant.
an assistant. You know someone who speaks spanish.
no, you don't need an assistant
you just serve the dogs, it's not that tough.
I'm pretty sure if I call the labor relations department and tell them about this little job interview you could lose your business license.
that's hot.
say it again.
you could lose your business license.
you could.
okay, it's not your mother, is it?
no, it's my daughter.
daughter, huh?
sold.
Yeah, minimum wage for the both of yous.
cool.
and don't tell the cook.
he thinks he's in training for another job at the mall.
gotta go. I got other Hot Dog Huts, babe.
but believe me, I'll be check in on you, if you know what I mean.
Oh, and no free dogs.
Hello, miss.
Oh, hey, Amy.
Hi, Jack.
you look like you could use some perking up.
would you like a chocolate bar? -Yeah.
all right, we got plain, caramel, nougat, dark chocolate, milk chocolate
wait, you're selling candy bars?
Yeah, the kid I'm mentoring, Duncan, he's selling candy bars for disadvantaged youth.
isn't he disadvantaged? - Yeah.
I guess That's why he's raising money for disadvantaged kids.
have a heart.
or better yet, have a fudge supreme.
how much? - Five bucks.
for a candy bar that I can get for a buck 50 in the grocery store?
it's for the youth.
I'm at the stairs by the water machine.
where are you? I need something
Oh, I'm right here.
Hey, J - I need $5. - Oh, sure.
Jack's selling candy bars. Y - you want one too?
for 5 bucks? That's a little steep.
it's disadvantage youth.
the kid I'm mentoring is selling them.
you're selling them.
so how is he learning anything?
he's learning that he can rely on me for help.
in that case I'll take four.
Thanks.
here you go.
and, hey, when the band's selling wrapping paper,
I'll help you out.
Oh, that's over.
next year then. Thank you.
you know, why can't I do that?
what? Sell candy bars?
no, get money from someone who's selling candy bars.
is your mom on you about getting a job again?
Yeah.
maybe you should just make the effort to apply for some jobs.
that you're willing to do whatever it takes to take care of the baby.
just like she's getting a job to help take care of you and Ashley.
you know what would be supportive?
if you said, "You shouldn't have to work, Amy."
you've already been through enough, your mom and dad should take care of you.
they are taking care of you.
they're just trying to show you what it's like to take care of the baby.
and you can do it.
I know I can do it.
I don't want to do it.
I'm having a baby, I don't wanna get a job.
well, what do you want to do, Amy?
do you want to find another couple to adopt the baby?
you should date my mother.
that would have been so much more if I can got up on my own.
see you.
so you two made up, huh?
did Amy tell you that?
Oh, let's not be so insecure, rich boy.
at least not so obviously insecure.
I don't have anything to be insecure about.
when the time is right I'm legally gonna marry Amy and spend rest of my life with her on her side.
or if you find another couple to a the baby
then I'm going to spend the rest of my life with Amy and visit your son.
so which one will you after, Ricky?
Amy or the baby?
both.
grace, that I know when women go on the pill, they crave chocolate.
I'm not on the pill, I have the pill, but I'm not on it.
and how do you suddenly know so much about birth control pills, Jack
I don't, really, I'm just trying to make a sales pitch.
I'm helping Duncan sell candy bars.
you're raising money for Duncan?
no, he's raising money for disadvantaged youth.
Oh, that's so nice. Especially since he's disadvantaged.
how much are they? - Five dollars.
ha. For one?
Jack, I can't pay $5 for a candy bar, even it is for disadvantaged youth.
but I can help you sell them. I'm kinda popular right now.
and besides, that's what Christians do, right?
they help each other when they need help.
Yeah, okay. I'll take you up on that offer.
Thanks, Grace.
no, no, no, I can do it.
okay. Now, by "it,"
I hope you mean sell candy bars.
Hey, girlfriend.
Oh. Hi, Grace.
what's that?
this is an opportunity to help the disadvantaged youth.
Oh, jeez. That's not those giant candy bars, is it?
I'm selling those for the majorettes to go to Washington D. C. next year.
well, I'm selling them for kids who can't even dream of going to Washington D. C.
Oh, you're good.
but no thanks.
how much you selling them for anyway?
five dollars.
we're selling ours for 2. 50.
you're majorettes. These are disadvantaged youth.
who can't even dream of being majorettes. Yeah, yeah.
I'm still not paying you 5 bucks for a candy bar.
okay, 2. 50 for half?
Nope.
do you wanna help me sell them?
no, I'm not even trying to sell mine.
I need you to do something for me.
do you think I could fit into that pink cashmere sweater that you have?
sure. You wanna borrow my sweater?
Yeah, if you don't mind.
no.
I'm trying to get my brother to have sex with me and I thought I'd have a better shot if I looked more innocent.
he's trying to court me, and, well, I don't have any courting clothes.
that's good he's trying to court you.
that'll give you a chance to act like a lady.
you know, ladies have sex.
no, not until they're married.
that wouldn't be a lady, that would be a...
me?
Oh, oh, Adrian, I have such a good idea.
you should become a virgin again.
a what? - Yeah.
you know, set the odometer back to zero.
ha. Okay, one, no you can't. And two, I'm not a car, and I don't like car analogies or jokes made about riding me or riding on me or...
Adrian! You're a lady now.
and I would never say those things about you.
you're my friend, and you could be my new virgin friend.
imagine how much your brother would like that, you reclaiming your virginity.
and, you know, while you're at it, you could tone down the lip gloss a little bit.
okay, watch how attracted guys are to the idea of having sex with a virgin.
does anybody want to help me out and buy a candy bar for the disadvantaged youth?
Oh, yeah.
I do. - I do.
awesome. Five dollars.
thank you. Thank you.
Thanks, boys.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, thank you.
Bye.
Hey, so, uh, who's your second choice if you don't get Amy, and/or the baby?
I know you're used to getting what you want.
let's just say this time you don't?
who are you gonna go after? Adrian?
Oh, that's right, Adrian's in love with her brother right now.
so what about Grace? Grace isn't gonna marry you.
she's probably gonna become a doctor, she'll probably marry a doctor.
she's a doctor's daughter, so a little out of your league, don't you think?
Oh, and by the way, if you and Amy don't find a couple to adopt the baby, you're gonna be paying child support for the next 18 years.
how are you gonna do that?
you don't just get to call yourself the daddy without being financially responsible for the child.
think about that. Child support every month for the next 18 years.
so if you're just using the baby as a way to get to Amy, just keep in mind that it's gonna cost you.
but you know that, right?
you shouldn't take things that you can't pay for, Ricky.
it wasn't Ricky.
then who was it?
George, I'm sorry if we disappointed you and Anne and Amy, but
who said you disappointed me?
I just wanna know what happened.
when we were gonna give the baby away then I was happy you are gonna take it but if you're not gonna take him, we're not gonna give the baby away.
George, that is so sweet.
no, I mean it.
it's late in the game.
it's too late to get to know anyone well to know if they should be parenting my grandson.
so who was it? It wasn't Ricky?
well...
I knew it.
it wasn't Ricky exactly.
it's all the Rickys who need parents.
these children present challenges, but what children don't?
we still want them.
Why?
why are you taking on someone else's problems when you won't take on ours?
George, this is kind of difficult to explain to you.
it's all about acceptance.
loving the imperfect makes us accept and love our own imperfections.
damn. You made me cry.
you know, Anne is imperfect, and I love her, I...
this divorce is killing me.
did you get the house?
I'm still waiting on the loan.
I should not have eaten those four candy bars.
you'll be fine.
Yeah, I just need to go home and take a nap.
Oh, hey, there you are.
what are you doing inside the school and not outside?
Hi, Ben.
Hi, Ms. Juergens. How are you?
I'm terrific.
I got a job today.
you're kidding me?
no, I'm not kidding you. And they like me so much that they're letting me have an assistant.
you speak Spanish, right?
right.
okay, well, we better go.
because we start at 3: 30.
we start what at 3: 30?
our job. Come on let's go, I'll tell you about it in the car.
mom, I've had a really long day.
I just ate four $5 chocolate bars, and I don't feel too well.
maybe we could start tomorrow.
twenty dollars worth of chocolate?
you're gonna have to work at least three hours for that.
maybe more, if you factor in taxes.
why do I get the feeling that this is not the job that I want?
it's a job that pays. That's what you want, right?
and it's a start. Plus, we'll be working together.
won't that be fun?
hm, what will be fun?
come on.
see you, Ben.
uh, bye.
that'll be 2. 75.
there you go.
could I have, uh, two dimes and a nickel?
sure.
those are full of nitrates, just so you know.
I know, and I don't care.
tasty nitrates.
bon appetit.
what can I get for you?
couple of hot dogs with mustard, ketchup and grilled onions.
two cry babies with a shot of red and yellow.
you have hamburgers? -No, we have hot dogs.
and soda, and water. And that's it.
Oh, and chips. - What about nachos?
Nope. - Kabobs?
I can cut up a hot dog and put it on a stick for you.
I don't want that, I want a kabob.
what kind of place is this? - American.
Oh, then I'll have the hamburger.
we don't have hamburgers.
then you're not American.
are you sure you don't want try the hot dogs?
they're really very tasty. -All right, all right.
give me a hot dog. Plain.
one naked dog.
[IN SPANISH]
no, she's just trying to teach me a lesson.
Oops, did I say that in English?
where are my cry babies?
thank you.
come on, Amy, get with it, girl.
if you don't have the job you want, you want the job you have.
hm. Who's got the dogs with onions?
there you go, sir.
she didn't tell you what kind of job?
she didn't even tell me she had a job.
you told me when you picked me up from school, if you recall.
what kind of job could she and Amy have together?
I'm sure I don't know.
but I guess she has a job, she can keep the baby, right?
don't be ridiculous, pumpkin.
we have enough money for Amy to keep the baby.
I just can't tell your mother that.
couldn't you tell Amy?
no, because she'd tell your mother.
how many times have we told Amy things and told her not to tell your mother and then she's told your mother?
so we're better off for her to have a job she doesn't want, to pay for a baby she doesn't want, that she's having with a guy she doesn't want?
you got it. That's what we want.
all right. Father knows best.
Hey, can I have a friend come over?
you can have whatever you want.
an imaginary friend or is this the guy with the dead dog?
it's that guy.
Yeah, he looked all right.
I'll be in the garage.
don't get pregnant.
unless you want a job you don't want.
practice! Practice, people!
that's you, Boykewich.
pfft. You are not a percussionist.
Yeah, I'm not an athlete either, so I figure I'll just stay here for the rest of the year so I don't have to take P. E.
how do you do it?
how do you do something you're bad at every day?
I've been doing it all my life.
I played tennis. I'm no good at tennis.
I tried golf, baseball, basketball, basket weaving.
I'm no good at any of it.
and I can't really dance, can't really sing.
none of it bothers me.
what bothers me, however, is your close proximity.
and just know that if you plan on hitting me,
I'm no good at fighting either.
but I do have money.
Yeah, so you win, and I lose, I guess.
what?
I just came here to concede.
you were right. I don't have money so I probably would not make the best father for the baby, or the best husband for Amy.
you know maybe Amy went back with you because the adoption fell through.
maybe she's just looking for security.
Yeah, or maybe she just loves me.
pfft. She loves your money anyway.
she loves the idea of not having to worry about our son's future.
so you and Amy have a nice life with my son.
a nice comfortable life.
you win, Ben.
thank you for inviting me into your home today, Grace.
I like to know what's going on with the young people, with teens.
I'm the father of a teen myself.
I think you both know Jack.
Oh, that's right. You're Jack's dad.
I forgot about that.
he doesn't know anything.
but I'm always willing to learn.
is this regarding Jack?
no.
Oh, good, heh.
made me nervous there for a second. So, what is this about?
we need you to restore her virginity.
but not because of Jack, right? - Right.
I've made a few mistakes. Maybe even more than a few.
although I don't like to think of sex as a mistake, it's just that I want my virginity back.
well, let me go out to my car and I'll wave my magic wand over you and abracadabra, you're restored.
uh, just joking.
Oh, ha-ha-ha.
he's so funny, isn't he?
Yeah. Hysterical.
well, actually no one has ever asked me to do this before.
I've never done this so I suppose the theory is that with God's forgiveness for what you've done in the past, and God forgives everything, you can always start over.
no matter what you've done.
so, Adrian, if you just ask for God's forgiveness for your sexual transgressions, you have that forgiveness.
you are a virgin again.
well, spiritually, not physically, of course.
of course.
are you, uh, Catholic? - Why?
well, this is the nature of the confessional, is it not?
you, each week you confess, and then you are forgiven and you start over.
Yeah, if you confess week to week.
I think this is our opportunity to win her over to our team, isn't it, reverend?
I don't do that.
I don't steal sheep from other pastures.
now, if they wanna wander over to our land,
I'm happy to shepherd them.
of course, this is not about our church doctrine, or your church's doctrine.
this is about you and God, this is about your life, this is about your beliefs.
if you wanna be forgiven, and commit to a life of abstinence and purity, then do it, Adrian.
but I do think that once you make a promise to God, that promise is a real commitment, you don't just say it to say it, you know what I mean?
Yeah. I know what you mean.
so think about it. And if that's what you want, ask for God to forgive you.
whether you do that by yourself or with my help, or the help of someone else, and you are on the way to a new beginning.
thank you so much, Reverend Stone.
I'm just gonna run upstairs and get my pink sweater.
Mm-hm.
aren't you the girl who broke up Jack and Grace?
not anymore.
okay, I'm okay... Okay. All right.
okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
Hi, yeah, uh, I just got mugged.
uh, I was getting out of my car and...
no, no, I'm not hurt.
I'm at...
no, no, they didn't have a gun.
I don't know, it was my candy bar money.
I don't know, I can't think! I was just mugged!
two hundred dollars, about 200.
Hey, that's money for disadvantaged youth!
you have a urinal in your garage?
not to worry, we have indoor plumbing too.
come on in.
so that was your dad out there?
he lives out there?
Yep. Sit down. Make yourself at home.
Oh, so I brought you something.
Wow.
you're a teenage alcoholic, huh?
no. It's for your parents.
Oh, okay. Thanks.
red. No refrigerator, right?
right.
so aspartame?
I hate small talk.
government conspiracy.
global warming?
also government conspiracy.
Really?
well, if they get everyone concerned about global warming, no one will pay attention to the fact that there's still large scale animal testing.
interesting.
you know that the presidency is bought and paid for by the cosmetics industry.
I better look that one up at the library.
so they can't trace it.
are we expecting someone?
Hello, Ben. - Benny. Thomas here.
how can we help you?
he said how can we help you, Ben?
I brought this for Amy, it's just a gift.
hey there, bus-stop boy, how's it hangin'?
good afternoon, sir. -Benjamin.
Hi, Mr. Juergens.
I brought this for Amy. When she gets home from work, there will be a little treat waiting for her.
that Amy.
I hope she's okay with this job. - Yeah.
I mean it's really good that she got something, it's good that Anne got something.
but, this? I mean, come on.
I'm so glad you said that. We're in complete agreement.
I hate that either one of them has to work at the Hot Dog Hut.
but it's a job.
it's an honest job, and people love hot dogs, and although they're not Boykewich hot dogs, I've...I've heard that they're not too bad.
you know, we were thinking, Ashley and me and this guy here, we were thinking about going and having dinner with Anne and Amy.
you wanna go? You know where they are exactly?
Yeah, but when I spoke with Amy, she said she didn't want any us to come down there.
that Amy. She probably wants to focus on work.
I'm sure she can take a break, it'll be fine.
Yeah, all right, if you say so.
let's go, my dad's in the car.
hold on, I wanna get my camera.
I'll be waiting in the car.
I don't guess we're allowed to stay in the house alone.
if we walk into the kitchen right now, he won't miss us.
invisible, remember?
Oh, yeah.
give me your sneakers.
Wha--?
Thanks, dude. - Thanks.
I'll buy those back from you.
here.
all right, what you got, man?
we're gonna give you a three-second head start.
three sec--?
one... - Okay.
two. - Pebble! Pebble!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
we're just joking, having fun, come back.
Really? - Yeah.
all right.
what, you think your shoes are cooler than ours?
let me answer that for you: No.
we don't want your shoes, man.
thank you.
and what are you running from?
I'm trying to catch the guy who stole my candy bar money.
wait a minute, you're not, um...
you don't know a kid named Duncan, do you?
Yeah, I'm his mentor.
what? - Duncan pulled that $2 candy bar scam on you?
it's not a scam. They're for disadvantaged youth.
and those are $5 bars.
wait, wait.
you didn't get with Shawna, did you?
look, man, Duncan is not in favor of anybody, whether white, black, brown, male, or female, having a sexual relationship with his sister.
and it's not about race, it's about a simple matter of Duncan doing what he can do to protect Shawna to ensure that she is never hurt, emotionally or physically.
thus, the ruse of staging a fake robbery to perhaps scare you off, or just let you know that Duncan is on to you and will be watching you for the duration of your relationship with Shawna.
or your relationship with Duncan, whichever lasts longer.
huh? -Psych major.
a fake robbery?
you are chasing Duncan.
you know that, right?
you need a ride?
Yeah, actually I do.
thank you.
Oh, I wasn't expecting you.
and I wasn't expecting to see you wearing Grace's sweater and a pearl necklace.
can I come in?
I'm expecting someone.
your brother?
maybe.
you can't sleep with your brother, Adrian.
I'm not planning on it.
I'm not planning on having sex again until I'm married.
I'm sorry, did I walk in on fantasy night?
is this some sort of role play?
I'm thinking about reclaiming my virginity.
how do you do that?
you wouldn't understand. - Try me.
maybe I'd like to reclaim my virginity with you.
does it involve sex?
because I'm needing some sex, Adrian.
I've had a hard day.
so you've come over here for me to make it all better by having sex with you?
Yeah. - No.
I'm not doing that anymore.
you don't make a good tease, Adrian.
I'm not teasing. I'm serious.
you can't reclaim your virginity, don't be ridiculous.
you are who you are, Adrian.
you can't rewrap the gift.
it's been given, many times.
it doesn't matter. I'm starting over.
great. Start over with me. I'll be your first.
I don't know.
I don't know if I want you to be my first.
Hey.
good night.
good night, nice meeting you.
sorry, that was my old boyfriend Ricky.
he just dropped by.
no explanation necessary.
we're not exclusive.
this is for you. Remember when you said you wanted a teddy bear for Christmas and didn't tell anyone because you were scared you wouldn't get it?
you actually listen to what I'm saying?
Yeah, you say interesting things.
anyway, there's your teddy bear. - I love it.
good.
I'm a virgin.
see, that's interesting that you would say that.
because before, you told me you were not a virgin.
okay, well, I'm thinking about becoming a virgin.
see, I'm thinking about asking God to forgive me for having sex, and then promising not to have sex again until I'm married.
you think God cares about that?
more importantly, do you?
no, I don't care.
I was thinking that this is our third date so, you know, if you wanna take that next step, and have sex...
so the courting is over?
because I really like the courting.
I-- I like the teddy bear.
I like the flowers, and I like dating. I like you.
I like you too.
would you still like me if we had sex?
I'd probably like you a lot.
look, let's talk about this.
about what?
let's talk about sex. Birth control, past partners.
Ricky. - Why?
because we should talk before we have sex.
again, why?
because there's just some business we should get out of the way before we get into a relationship.
sexual relationship or relationship?
isn't sex part of a relationship?
I am so confused. Uh, maybe it's this sweater.
maybe it's like those traveling pants.
let's go get a bite to eat and talk.
have you had dinner yet? - No.
it's okay, Adrian, it's okay.
virgin, or not a virgin, it's okay.
no, Dad, I'm not upset. I really don't care.
no, we don't want hot dogs, I made something here.
all right, bye.
here's that thing that I was talking about.
the same corporation that produces the aluminum cans owns the recycling plant, so what we're actually doing is helping them to resell us what we already paid for.
I would be upset but you gotta admit, that's pretty smart.
and a nickel on every can goes to no-kill shelters.
Yeah, but they charge 250 bucks for rescued dogs.
Yeah, I went there.
that's crazy.
Thanks, hon.
anytime.
Cheers.
so how was your day?
school sucks.
Oh, I'm sorry.
this is delicious.
it's nice to have a home-cooked meal.
people don't do this enough.
dinner with the family.
Yeah, then again, we're not family.
how old are you really?
I'm 13.
I knew it.
there you go.
how much longer you guys working tonight?
should be finished in an hour. Unless the boss says otherwise.
we got an inspector coming tomorrow.
well, good luck with that.
good night. - Thanks.
just one more hour, Amy.
and we will have completed our first day of work.
another hour?
Yes, another hour.
but you've made 50 bucks tonight. Isn't that great?
Anne? -Hey! Look who's here!
Oh, no. - Hi, Leo. Hi, Ben.
wanted to check out the competition. How are the dogs?
why don't you order a couple and see?
I'll do that, give me a couple of them, just mustard.
Oh, uh, just Amy, please.
couple of yellow dogs and Amy, why don't you take a break?
I should have taken French.
so how are you?
I'm good.
so is George.
Hee-hee! Employee of the month!
make fun of me all you want, George, but I love working here.
I'll be over there with Amy
no, wait.
Thanks.
there you go.
keep the change. Thank you. - Thanks.
those dogs look good. Can you make me one?
you know how I like it.
Fernando, can you take a hot dog, split it down the middle, put it on the grill to brown it, and then take those onions and put it in the middle with just a little bit of ketchup?
coming right up.
what?
what, Miss?
I thought you only spoke Spanish.
I thought your daughter needed a job.
Thanks, Fernando.
what, you speaking the language now? - Maybe.
maybe I'll learn Spanish if I work here long enough.
you're really gonna work here? - I am working here.
and you know what? I love it.
what about your power suit, huh? Admit it, you can't get a job.
not a real job. - This is a real job.
no, it isn't. - Yes, it is.
admit it. You need me. - No, I don't.
here. - Read the grease on the wall, you're never gonna make it.
next!
Hi. Can I just have a cup of coffee?
uh, you could, but all we have are these Styrofoam cups, and I hate those. You wouldn't happen to have a coffee mug on you?
I do in my car.
if you wanna go get it,
I'll brew a fresh pot of coffee for you.
that one's been in there a while.
you know, I've been coming to the Hot Dog Hut for a while and, uh, I've never seen you here before.
and I was gonna ask you what you're doing working here but I guess I found out.
divorce, huh? - Yep.
is this your first day of work? - Yeah, it is.
I looked around for a while, but, um, yeah, I've been home for 15 years so...
this is the best I could do.
you know what? It's actually not so bad, it's kind of fun.
I'm the architect on the renovation across the street.
we're trying to transition into being a more green firm.
you wouldn't know anything about environmental supplies, or construction, or anything like that?
no, but I didn't know anything about hot dogs till today.
you should give me a call.
we're looking for somebody to do research, manage vendor relationships, that kind of thing.
you should come see me, we should talk.
okay. I will. Thanks.
Oh, wait, do you want that cup of coffee?
Oh, I never really wanted a cup of coffee.
call me.
Ah. America.
but you don't have to go back there.
you don't have to go back to work.
I'm gonna take care of you.
how? - Amy, my dad is the Sausage King.
you don't have to be the hot dog girl.
I hate being the hot dog girl.
as if being pregnant at 15 isn't humiliating enough.
like you said, your mom's just trying to teach you a lesson.
she's probably just trying to motivate you to find the right family for the baby.
you'd think that Ricky's mom would help out.
she's a social worker.
Oh, that's right.
she just lured Donovan and Leon away with those foster kids.
probably because Ricky really doesn't want the baby adopted.
I don't care what Ricky wants.
he said he'd go along with whatever I said.
as it turns out, I think he's going along with what I said.
Ricky and I got into a couple of, heh, heated discussions today.
about? - About the fact that he can't afford to pay child support and raise a baby for the next 18 years.
and that he should just back off and let you and me take care of the baby.
Amy, if you choose to keep the baby,
I can give your son the best of everything.
he's right.
no, he is not right.
are you out of your mind, Benjamin?
you don't have a dime.
I have dimes, you don't.
and what Anne is doing here is very admirable.
she's working hard at an honest job to get what she wants, and if you wanna be this baby's father, you should be willing to work hard too.
and even then, you may not end up rich.
it's not about being rich. It's all about working.
working is a good thing in and of itself.
I started out working at a butcher shop when I was 13 years old.
I worked my butt off to get what we have.
and if you love this girl, and you wanna take care of her son, you get your butt up and get in that kitchen and help her out.
and tomorrow start looking for a job, the way I told you to do weeks ago.
it's okay. He'll come around, I'm the only child.
right, got it. Thanks, Dad.
parents. Butcher shop when he was 13.
it's the family butcher shop.
we still own it.
what?
you don't have to help me out in there.
Amy, I'd do anything for you.
anything but get a job.
I know, that was a joke.
I'll try to get something.
kid's gonna drive me nuts. - That's a kid's job.
to bust your ass every single day.
he's a good kid, but if he thinks he's ready to be a father, he's got another thought coming.
I mean, if Amy wants to keep the baby, and he wants to be a part of her life, part of the baby's life, that's fine with me, I love both of 'em, but he should work a little harder, a lot harder.
I had no idea Ben was this lazy.
he's nice, he's smart.
but man, is he lazy.
I'm gonna give him a job at that butcher shop where I started out. Come on, let's go.
he can get a ride home from Anne and Amy.
Yeah. Okay.
Hey, you wanna beat that guy up who was flirting with Anne on the way to the car?
there was a guy flirting with Anne?
you saw him.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do, George?
come on. Let's go.
Oh, I can't believe I'm getting married.
it's really exciting.
I don't know what I did to deserve all this happiness.
well, she and I threw you a baby shower, so I thought maybe you and I should throw her a baby shower.
uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.
I just wanted to say thank you for the shower.
no. What you really wanted to do was let me know that everything went well with Ben.
do I really need to know that Adrian and Ben are having sex?
apparently everyone knows, just like everyone knows you and Amy probably aren't having sex.
I wanna sleep with you, Amy. - I know.
And? - I want our relationship to be more than sex.
I've been running around all day getting ideas for that shower you're gonna throw next week.
I told you I would do it.
Yeah, but you did it last time, and it was totally lame.
grace, Kathleen, you've met my mother Carrie.
and this is Grant's father Vic Foeburg.
I can't wait to start our lives together.
well, I think we're off to a really hot start.
these are really clever. And they're cute.
they're really cute. Did you make them?
Yeah. I did. Well, my mom and I did. Actually, it was just my mom.
she doesn't really have anything to do right now with her husband away.
I think they're great.
and we could put them in a scrapbook for her along with the photos and the lists of gifts and all that.
Yeah.
now all we need is the list of who she wants to invite.
Adrian told me you were gonna come up with that.
well, no, I can't come up with that. She has to come up with that.
if she gives me a list, then I'll make sure everybody gets the invitation.
but I don't know who she wants to invite.
Yeah. I don't know either. I guess all of her friends.
and who would that be?
I mean, besides you and me? - Yeah. We'll be there, of course.
but I don't know who else should be there.
well, I'm sure she has other friends. I mean, your sister, for one.
Yeah. I guess Adrian would consider her a friend.
although I don't know how much fun Ashley would be at a shower, or if she'll come to a shower. I barely got her to come to my shower.
what about your friends? What about Madison and Lauren?
well, that's the thing. They're my friends.
I don't know if Adrian considers them her friends.
well, wait a minute. Alice. We can invite Alice.
invite me? - To Adrian's baby shower.
it's this Saturday. - Oh, yeah. Look.
these are really cute invitations.
thank you. That was my contribution.
and I made the reservation and put the deposit down at Jeff's.
and Adrian wanted Amy to come up with a list of girls to invite, and you were at the top of our list.
Oh, that's so nice. But I didn't realize it was this Saturday.
and I think I have a family obligation.
Oh.
a bar mitzvah. Yeah. My cousin's bar mitzvah.
but if I don't get there, I will definitely send a gift. See you.
a bar mitzvah?
maybe her dad's Jewish.
I think her mom's Buddhist.
that's what she said when we met her at that school dance.
Oh, the night Adrian and Ben...
Yeah. Anyway, my point is that families can be mixed religions, mixed races, mixed ethnicities.
true. But I think the bar mitzvah was a little white lie to get her out of this.
are those the invitations to my shower?
Yeah. - Yeah.
Amy's still working on the invitation list.
I was hoping that maybe you'd give me a list of friends you'd like to invite.
friends? I don't have any friends.
sure you do. - No, I don't, other than you two and maybe your sister. That's kind of iffy.
so it'll just be the three of us?
well, I made 20 invitations.
my mom did.
let's put them to good use.
I wanna invite the girls who thought that I got just what I deserved when I got pregnant.
I wanna invite the girls who were mean to me before I got pregnant.
I don't want friends there. I want enemies.
I wanna show them all just how great my life is now.
Hey, Zoe.
Oh, hey, Adrian. What's up?
Amy and Grace are throwing me a baby/wedding shower, and you're invited.
why are you inviting me?
I slept with your boyfriend.
although now he's your boyfriend.
although he used to be your boyfriend, too, right?
Yeah.
God, are you just gonna invite every girl that Ricky ever slept with?
maybe.
and every girl who slept with Ricky when he was with Adrian!
no, thanks.
can't.
thanks anyway.
you know, I really don't have an excuse.
I just don't want to get you a gift.
did you do that just to show me how many girls Ricky slept with?
no, I did not do that just to show you how many girls Ricky has slept with.
and those aren't all the girls Ricky has slept with.
geez, Amy, this isn't about you. Okay? This is about me.
I just want them to know that I won, that I came out on top and that I'm getting everything that I ever wanted and then some, and they're not.
sorry. I'm out.
can you believe that?
Adrian, run after her and apologize.
that was a terrible thing to do to her.
what-- It's not like she didn't know Ricky's been with other girls.
Oh, that probably wasn't even half of them.
those were just the ones that slept with him when I was with him.
and, again, this isn't about Amy, okay? This is about me, all right?
those girls were mean to me, and they always thought they were better than me.
okay, well, I don't know anything about those girls, but I do know something about Amy.
and after everything you guys have been through, after all the competition between you two, she was still willing to be your friend and throw you a baby shower.
Oh, no. Please tell me you didn't want Amy to do all this so you could rub it in her face that you won, that you got her boyfriend, and you're having a baby with her boyfriend, and you're marrying her boyfriend?
so what?
she has my boyfriend.
she already had a baby with my boyfriend.
and her old boyfriend is way better than my old boyfriend, so...
I did win.
and maybe you ought to take a look at yourself.
if you and Amy had come up with a list of people to invite, then I wouldn't feel as if you were throwing it in my face that I have no friends at a time when I need friends.
you wouldn't believe what Adrian did to me before school.
Oh, we heard. - Yeah, that was really lousy.
Yeah, and she just wanted to embarrass me by pointing out how many girls Ricky has been with.
and it's not like I don't know that Ricky has been with a lot of girls.
I just didn't need to see them all in one place at one time like that.
and not that that was all of them.
no, not hardly.
but you can't let her get to you, especially when things are going so well with Ricky.
easier said than done.
you know, it's one thing to know that he's slept with other girls, it's another to actually see them.
I'm sorry, Amy.
why did she do it? Did she have a reason?
she says that she doesn't have friends to invite to the shower, so she's going to invite her enemies.
and those are her enemies.
girls who slept with Ricky.
Wow. That's a lot of enemies.
look, Amy, the whole idea of you throwing a shower for Adrian was ridiculous in the first place.
Yeah, why were you gonna do that?
because she threw me a shower.
well, she was having sex in her bedroom with her stepbrother during your shower.
what? - You didn't know?
no. I didn't even know she had a stepbrother.
it's her dad's ex-wife's son.
so they're not like really related or anything.
you know, whatever she was doing during my shower.
what difference does it make? She gave me a shower.
well, that doesn't mean that you owe her one back.
Yeah, it doesn't mean you owe her anything.
Adrian's been a witch lately.
and, I mean, I feel badly that she's having a baby that she hadn't planned and she's still in high school, but she did this to herself.
well, not exactly.
you know what I mean.
actions have consequences.
and, Amy, I hate to say it, but you really did this to yourself.
it's not that we don't feel really badly for you, but oh, yeah, we feel badly for you.
that's not a pretty picture-- all those girls in the hallway.
not pretty at all.
you know, maybe you should've just come up with who to invite.
so you're sayjng it's my fault because I agreed to do something nice for Adrian.
well, kind of.
you're just too nice. - Yeah.
you always have been. - Mmm.
that's how this whole thing started.
you were too nice to Ricky when you had sex with him at band camp.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
it's nice to know what my friends really think.
well, she was too nice. Way too nice.
well, maybe you were too hard on her.
maybe you were too hard on her.
and, really, I don't know why she'd be nice to Adrian.
Adrian is not nice to her.
she's not nice to anybody, except maybe Ben.
Yeah. No wonder she doesn't have any friends to invite to her shower.
you know, I'd say something to Adrian if she wasn't having a baby.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, would you?
well, just ignore that I'm having a baby and say what you wanna say.
it's a natural process-- having a baby.
it's not like I'm sick or I'm dying or anything, so say what you wanna say,
o best friends of Amy Juergens.
uh, I, um...
I just, uh.
we were hoping to go to your shower. - Yeah.
and I guess we weren't invited, and that really hurt our feelings.
you two are liars.
hurt your feelings?
I didn't hurt your feelings. Your friend Amy hurt my feelings.
but don't worry. I don't expect you to take my side in this.
I don't need you or anybody else to take my side in this.
okay, you are not a very good liar.
I was just trying to spare her from more pain.
Oh, so you're taking Adrian's side. - No, I'm not.
I'm always on Amy's side even when she's wrong.
and I'm not saying she's wrong.
well, was she or wasn't she?
Hey, Adrian.
I've been looking for you.
I was in the bathroom washing my face.
stupid Amy made me cry messed up my eyeliner.
this pregnancy is making me all girlie.
Amy made you cry? - Yes.
I'm sure you don't think little Miss Teen Mother Role Model did anything wrong, - but she did. - What-- No, no, no.
I would believe she did something wrong if you say she did something wrong.
what did she do?
she embarrassed me by pointing out that I have no friends to invite to my shower.
you have friends. You have plenty of friends.
no, I don't.
I don't have any friends at all.
well, except for you. And you're all that I need.
I'm gonna have a word with Amy, if you don't mind.
no, I don't mind.
but I'm sure Ricky would mind.
so maybe you'd better not.
Yeah, well, I don't care if Ricky minds.
no one's gonna make the mother of my baby and my future wife cry at school.
they were all just standing there right in front of me.
all those girls that you ever slept with.
I think she did it on purpose, because I think that she's still in love with you.
even though she's having a baby and getting married to Ben, I think she's still in love with you, and she doesn't want you to be with me.
Adrian is not still in love with me. That's ridiculous.
and I don't care anyway. You know, I care about you.
you said you loved me.
Yeah. Not at school, okay? That's personal.
and Adrian knows I care about you, and she doesn't care about anyone but herself right now.
she's having a baby.
Yeah, well, I had a baby.
Yeah, and?
and I cared about people other than myself.
okay.
okay?
whose side are you on?
no one's. I'm staying out of this.
Oh, really? And how are you going to do that?
you're already in this. - How am I in this?
because you're the one who slept with all the girls in the hallway.
I've slept with no one since you asked me not to.
and I suggest we drop this before neither of us wants to sleep with the other one.
what does that mean? - It means just what I said.
I'm staying out of this.
where do you think you're going?
I might ask you the same thing.
look, you stay away from Adrian.
Amy's hurt her enough, and I'm gonna go talk to Amy about that right now.
you're what? - She upset Adrian.
Adrian is having a baby. She should not be upset.
I agree. She shouldn't be upset.
but you'd think that since Adrian's pregnant and about to be a mother that she'd be a little nicer to everyone else, including Amy.
no, you'd think everybody else would be a little nicer to her, including Amy.
I told Amy I'm staying out of this.
and I'm staying out of this, and I suggest you do the same.
just let Adrian and Amy do whatever Adrian and Amy are gonna do.
let's not you and me get involved here.
no. I'm involved.
I'm plenty involved. I'm talking to Amy.
no, you're not. You stay away from Amy.
and you stay away from Adrian.
I wasn't going anywhere near Adrian.
and she embarrassed her in front of a whole hallway of people.
so you're not only insisting on being involved in this stupid fight, you're bringing Bunny into this?
we're off the clock, and Bunny is a friend of my family, and this is a private conversation.
guys, you can't keep bringing this stuff into the workplace.
I'm not, but if I were, I'd tell you that Adrian wanted to invite every girl I've ever slept with to her shower just so she could show them how much better her life is without me, simultaneously showing Amy how many girls I've slept with, and possibly affecting our relationship when things just started looking really good for us.
please. Is that what Amy's telling you?
Yeah, that's what Amy's telling me, But, Ben, this is a chick fight, and chick fights are dangerous. Any fight between any two people is dangerous.
I know this. I watched my parents fight all the time, and I learned to stay out of it. So let's agree to stay out of it.
there's Adrian's side, and there's Amy's side, and we don't have a side.
I have a side.
I'm not a neutral party and neither are you.
but you could be, so let's shake hands and come out not fighting.
no offense, but I'm not shaking hands.
look, I don't like to have personal problems going on at work, but this is the kind of personal problem that can escalate into a global problem.
you know that, and I know that.
so let's get back in there and get Ben and talk this through.
I don't wanna talk. I just wanna do my job.
and I wanna do my job without talking to anyone that I don't have to talk to, if you don't mind.
I do mind. I'm telling you, I see it.
this is gonna snowball into hell.
not because of me.
so you're taking his side?
I'm not taking sides, and you and Ricky shouldn't take sides.
so you agree with Ricky. Of course.
when you take sides, the rest of the world lines up behind one or the other of you, so
so fine. I'm taking Adrian's side.
and it makes me really angry that other people don't take her side because they're too busy judging her.
somehow she got labeled as the bad girl, and no matter what she does or says, people wanna think of her as the bad girl.
Somehow"? "Somehow she got labeled as a bad girl"?
we're one and the same-- Adrian and me.
we've both been with too many people for all the wrong reasons.
and admit it, Adrian always seems to enjoy things better if things include getting back at people along the way
me, her mother, her father. Anyone. Even you.
this is not getting in the middle?
well-- - I'm just telling you what I know
I know her, and I know Amy.
and that fight today was probably as much one's fault as the other's.
so let's stay out of it, and that's the last time I'm saying that.
let's not. At this point,
I know Adrian better than you know Adrian, and she was not out to hurt anyone at school today.
I know that. - You do not know that.
you don't know anything about that fight, and neither do I.
and we can't possibly really know what Amy's motivation was for not having the invitation list, or Adrian's motivation for including girls I slept with on the invitation list, or if either of them even had a motivation.
what's your real reason for not coming to Amy's defense?
I think you're still in love with Adrian. That's the problem.
you're still in love with her. - I was never in love with her.
no, you were in love with her. You told her you were in love wither.
I told all of those girls I was in love with them, too.
what do you mean you don't know if there's gonna be a shower?
after that, there's still supposed to be a shower?
I froze four dozen cupcakes this afternoon that I baked from scratch and made little teeny-tiny roses for.
there's gonna be a shower.
mom, there's no one to invite.
I'm not gonna invite a bunch of mean girls who slept with Ricky.
I can't do that. I can't ask Amy to buy them lunch. That's crazy.
there must be at least four or five girls.
Adrian knows from majorettes or from...
well, what else was she involved in at school?
nothing.
and come on. Everybody knows the majorettes are all sluts.
you know that's not true.
I know. I guess Adrian's not that close with them.
it doesn't mean they can't be friends.
I'll try.
it just seems like Adrian wants the shower for all the wrong reasons.
stop being so judgmental, honey.
I mean, maybe she just wants a shower because she wants a shower.
most brides and mothers-to-be want to have a shower, and most of the time their friends and family wanna give them a shower.
and I've already spent too much time and too much money on this for you to just give up.
and you've spent too much time and too much effort on your friendship with Adrian to just give up.
I don't wanna spend any more time or effort on this friendship or the shower.
I really don't.
maybe if you weren't so busy having sex with Grant, you would have more time and energy for your friends and for this shower.
I know, but given the choice-- - You don't have a choice.
there's gonna be a shower.
and if you and Adrian are the only two people there, you're not gonna feel very good about it, and neither is she and neither am I.
mom, it was like a nightmare.
all of them standing there, staring at me.
well, were they staring at you, or were they staring at Adrian?
okay, fine. They were staring at Adrian, and I was staring at them, because
how could she do that to me? How?
well, I'm not so sure that she was doing anything to you.
at least she didn't plan on doing anything to you.
just walk over next door and talk to her.
just apologize if you did anything to offend her, and just work it out, Amy.
what? If I did anything? How about if she did anything?
well, so what if she did something?
she's very pregnant, and she and Ben are getting married.
she's probably under a lot of stress, so just give her a breakã
hold on. There's someone on the other line.
Hello? - Amy, is that you?
who is this? - Oh. Sorry.
it's Kathleen Tseguay.
who? - Kathleen, Grace's mom.
Oh, hi. Uh, I'm on the other line with my mom.
Oh, well, I was hoping to talk to your dad.
mom, that's Kathleen Bowman.
or some other name. Wife number one.
she wants to speak with Dad.
well, then let her speak to Dad. Good night, Amy. I love you.
dad!
you love me? It's our first date.
it's not our first date. I wasn't talking to you.
fine. I don't wanna talk anyway.
Hello? - George.
who is this? - Kathleen.
that's the one.
you wanted to see me?
Yes. I wanted to ask you something.
is that you? Are you wearing cologne?
is that what you wanted to ask me?
you call me all the way from the guest house, and you ask me if I am wearing cologne?
what? No. I called you up here to ask if you know if Adrian has any friends or girlfriends.
has she ever mentioned any girlfriends to you?
I don't know anything about any girlfriends.
hers or mine. Good night.
are you sure?
I am sure. - What about Tammy?
do you think Tammy would go to a shower for Adrian?
would my old girlfriend go to a shower for a woman I still love?
I doubt it. - Help me.
I need to find someone to go to Adrian's shower.
I think Mom's doing that.
no. She's doing a bunch of other stuff, and I'm supposed to do that.
she told me to find a bunch of girls to go to Adrian's shower.
Yeah. Poor Grace.
you got it really tough.
you're beautiful, you're smart, you have boyfriend, and yet you always do is complain, complain, complain.
that's not a very nice thing to say to me, Tom.
well, that's not nice to say Adrian has no friends.
you could make her feel bad.
I never said that. I didn't make her feel bad.
Amy made her feel bad.
then I don't like you or Amy.
Why? Because you're still in love with Adrian?
maybe if you got over her, you'd find someone else to go out with.
you think you know everything, but if you're really smart, you wouldn't have sex with every guy you date.
I can't believe you just said that.
I said it, and I meant it.
Tom! Wait! I need to talk to you!
you stink, you know that?
I don't stink! You stink! You and your cologne!
I know. That was the funniest thing you ever did.
putting those bunk beds in our bedroom and...
Oh. Hi, Grace. Do you need something?
who are you talking to?
do you need something?
no.
grace just walked in, so I should probably go.
I thought you were sick of talking to teenagers. I know I am.
I didn't say that.
no, you said that, and I agreed with you.
no, no. You said it, and I agreed with you.
mom.
Yeah, well, despite that, you have to talk to Grace, and I have to talk to Amy.
good luck. - You, too. Good night.
that wasn't Jeff.
no, it wasn't.
it was George Juergens.
I called him to ask if he would encourage Amy to work things out with Adrian.
I told you, Adrian should be the one to work things out with Amy.
either way, they should work it out.
just so we can have the stupid shower?
no, not so we can have the stupid shower. Because they're friends.
and are you and George friends now?
come on, Grace. George is George.
you wouldn't...
cheat on Jeff? No, I wouldn't.
were you about to say that I've done that before?
I cheated before when I was married to George?
maybe, but I didn't.
you're on restriction. Starting now.
so I can't throw that shower?
can't anyone else answer the stupid door?
No! And ask who it is!
Duh. Who is it? - Ben.
I'd like to speak with you, if I may.
Yeah, you may. Come on in.
I don't really have a lot of time.
I was just cutting John's nails, and he hates that.
I have to study for calculus, and I hate that.
Hi, John.
wanna sit down? - Yeah, if you don't mind.
if you don't mind, if I may..."
I know what this is about.
Hey, Dad, will you get John?
okay. Go on, buddy.
got him!
I'm really upset with you, but I'm trying to be polite.
I don't have time for polite.
just tell me why you're upset. Say what you wanna say.
like I don't already know.
so you do know that you were rude to Adrian and made her cry.
Adrian was rude to me and made me cry.
in response to what you did to her.
which was try to throw her a baby shower.
no. Which was to point out that she has no friends to come to a baby shower.
I was not doing that. I just didn't know who to invite.
that was her job-- to come up with a list.
she doesn't have a list.
Oh, no, no. She did have a list.
it just was not the list I was looking for.
Amy, we're friends, aren't we?
I don't know. I don't know what being friends with you means.
that we once loved each other, but now we love other people.
so now we're just friends. But we are friends.
so, if I ask you, as a friend, to make up with Adrian and just come up with some girls to come to the shower, can't you do that for me, for old time's sake?
I don't know anyone to come to the stupid shower.
and after what Adrian did, I don't even wanna go to the stupid shower.
all right. I have a suggestion for a shower guest.
maybe you can just invite her, and then the list will grow from there.
ask Alice. - I did ask Alice.
and she's going to a cousin's bar mitzvah on Saturday.
she's Japanese.
I know that.
Ben, since we're friends,
I wanna be honest with you and tell you something that your other friends won't tell you.
you're having a baby with a girl who got pregnant because she was trying to get back at her old boyfriend.
and you're marrying her and sharing the rest of your life with her, and she's still trying to get back at her old boyfriend and all the girls he ever slept with, including me.
and that's the truth.
so deal with it.
and just what was your reason for getting pregnant?
were you taken advantage of? Did Ricky take advantage of you?
were you sexually stupid?
did you not know that having unprotected sex could result in a pregnancy?
you know, at least Adrian is willing to take responsibility for what happened.
Yeah, even though it was an accident,
Adrian is willing to take responsibility.
and Adrian is honest, even brutally honest.
so I believe her bwhen she says that she wasn't out to get you today.
and I believe her when she says that she was embarrassed because there was no list of girls to invite.
and I believe her when she says that she loves me and wants to be with me for the rest of our lives.
do you believe Ricky when he tells you that he loves you?
because Ricky has told every girl that he has ever been with that he loves her.
do you really love Ricky? The real Ricky?
the guy who slept with all those girls?
the guy that every girl has been with?
or do you just wanna justify getting pregnant by him in the first place?
get out of this house.
and gladly.
you still want me to throw a shower for Adrian?
Oh, boy.
she's my daughter.
I think he forgets how much Amy has been through.
I don't know what to say other than he's my son, and right now he's going through a lot.
that's not Amy's fault.
what?
well, no, it's not exactly her fault.
not exactly? What does that mean?
nothing. It means nothing.
you know I'm under a lot of pressure here myself, and I don't wanna say anything I shouldn't.
so, I'll talk to Ben.
good. Talk to Ben.
how is it Amy's fault? How could it possibly be Amy's fault?
let's just let sleeping dogs lie, huh?
let's not.
George, my 17-year-old son is having a baby.
he's moving out of my house and into a condo, and he's getting married.
and in the midst of all that, he did something stupid tonight.
I'm sorry.
you don't have to apologize to me. He has to apologize to Amy.
and I don't care what his excuse is. There is no excuse.
my Amy is a nice girl. She didn't deserve that.
I'm sure she didn't.
but if there's an excuse, I'd say that
Ben fell in love with Amy, and it was the beginning of the end of a normal teenage existence as he knew it.
it took him down a completely different path that neither Ben or I wanted him to go.
and I'm not saying that him having a baby and getting married is Amy's fault, and I'm not saying that argument today is Amy's fault.
I'm just saying that the forces behind that argument today were set in motion a long time ago by Amy.
well, I don't know anything about forces or consequences or going down paths or normal teenage existence or any of that other gibberish.
all I know is your son came over to my house tonight and said some horrible things to my daughter.
he did. But from his perspective, those horrible things are true.
and it's the perspective of a young man who got involved with a girl that was pregnant at 15.
what the hell is going on?
what new conspiracy against adrian and me is this?
dad if you think you're gonna force an apology from me for what i said tonight, you're wrong.
I'll talk to him.
do that.
do not put me in a position to defend you again.
I don't like having to defend you.
in the process of defending you, I said some things that i now regret.
I rarely do that, but I did that because I completely lost my mind
in trying to stand up for you, which is what you're doing in trying to stand up for adrian.
you do not go over to someone's house and attack them like that.
even if you think it's the honorable thing to do.
defending your bride.
you escalated a little fight in the hallway today ???
and i really don't know how to stop it at this point.
but it needs to be stopped as soon as possible.
stopped or won? - Stopped.
yo, hey, what's up?
you wanted to talk to me?
you mind?
good night, alice, henry.
good night. - Good night.
so does the prince.
you have a bar mitzvah to go to this saturday?
Alice? - Uh-Oh.
look,
if you don't wanna be friends with adrian,
then you don't wanna be friends with me.
Oh, no.
I wanna be friends with adrian.
I just don't wanna go to a shower.
you two are my only friends,
and I don't wanna sit around with amy and adrian and grace.
and play shower games.
and why would you?
I mean, you've only been coming over to my house for, what, almost ten years now?
eating our food And being driven by our chauffeur.
sleeping in my room, And playing in our game room.
watching movies in our screening room, and going to sports events
and concerts and restaurants all at my family's expense.
why would you wanna do me the very small favor of getting a little gift for my soon-To-Be wife's shower?
my soon-To-Be wife and mother of my daughter's shower?
that's a bit harsh, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
it's not that i don't love you. I love you,
Ben. It's just that
I don't wanna be part of all this. I don't really think you should be getting married.
Oh, god.
what do you think, henry?
I think that neither of you can take back What you just said to each other,
and so i'll just say i love you both,
and i apologize to each of you for what the other said.
and i wish you love, peace, And soul train!
just trying to use humor to keep our friendship from falling into a black hole.
too late.
that's not what we broke up over
whether or not you would have sex with me. - Yes, it was.
it was why you wouldn't have sex with me. - Okay, why you wouldn't
because you thought i'd had sex with that girl you hated.
what girl i hated?
Karen. - Who?
Oh, come on. She made lunch for me one day.
that was the end of it for you and me.
Oh, yeah. Ham sandwich and a bag of chips.
Oh, yeah. Now it's coming back to me.
you did not forget that. Come on.
no, i did. Wait. I beat her out for position on the cheerleading squad, So she went after you to get back at me.
I never did anything with that girl.
okay, but you wanted to, and she wanted to. That'why she made you a ham sandwich.
we were having a perfectly nice evening.
why'd you have to go and bring that up for?
it was high school.
Oh, come on. It was nothing.
okay. Well, maybe it's nothing, But because of that, we both ended up marrying other people.
because of a ham sandwich?
Yep.
high school stinks.
we're not in high school anymore.
the whole world's a high school.
this shower has gotten completely out of hand.
Yeah.
it's funny how one little argument can destroy an entire universe.
Yeah.
do you remember why we broke up?
uh, yeah. You cheated on me.
Yeah, but it was more than that, really.
no, that was it.
no, you didn't wanna go to couples counseling
because the counselor was a woman.
and i felt that i needed a woman on my side.
I thought that a woman could explain why a woman would cheat on her husband and,
well, make it sound good. But you wouldn't go.
no. And you know what?
I still don't think a marriage can be saved through counseling.
and now i've got the experience to prove it.
Yeah, well, the marriage counselor really couldn't have made it sound good,
because i was just angry on a really deep level.
I- I'd gotten married way too early,
and i didn't really wanna be married. I just wanted to have sex.
Oh, wanted to be close to someone, and i wanted someone to love me.
I loved you.
you used to leave your socks on the floor.
I had told you that was driving me crazy
your socks on the floor. I felt like i was always picking up your dirty socks.
I like to just step out of them.
I still do.
I stand on the toe of one sock, and i pull my foot out,
and then i stand on the toe of the other sock, and i pull my foot out.
I've been doing it since i was a kid.
it's like setting my feet free.
I love the feeling.
well, i never told you that i threw away every sock that you left on the floor until you were almost out of socks.
and then
when you were down to your last pair,
I- I- I got scared, and i went out,
and, um, bought you some new socks.
so what are you saying? The guy you cheated with was a sock salesman?
the guy sold socks? - Well, he owned the sock company.
he just happened to be in the store.
so you did it with him because my socks were on the floor?
your socks were on the floor every day for a couple years, george,
and it went to a bad place inside me
picking up those socks. I just I felt like i was your servant.
and i had had it drilled into me all my life by my own mother
that women are the servants of man, And i just didn't like it.
I didn't like picking up those socks, george.
I hated it.
what was it that you said earlier?
it's funny how one little argument can destroy the entire universe.
it was just socks.
grace, i'm telling you, He feels really bad.
just go down there and talk to him.
no. If he felt really bad, he'd come up here.
you know he didn't mean it. - Well, then he shouldn't have said it.
Grace- - What?
do you mind? I'm trying to text grant.
will you just forget about grant for two seconds? - You'd like that, wouldn't you?
what is wrong with you?
I'll tell you what's wrong with me.
my day started off badly, and it's only gotten worse.
I cannot believe this fight with adrian has escalated into this
into my not being able to see grant.
and how are you blaming that on adrian?
who am i supposed to blame it on? Me?
it's not my fault adrian doesn't have any friends to invite to her shower.
as her one and only friend,
surely you know this about adrian:
she doesn't have any friends.
well, as usual, that sounds like something madison would say.
did you say that or did madison say that?
I haven't even spoken to madison tonight 'Cause i've been too busy talking to tom as if i don't have two tests tomorrow.
why don't you just admit that the fight in the hallway
was as much your fault as anyone else's?
I don't think you wanna throw a shower for adrian,
because if you did, you would've come up with a list of girls to invite.
that wasn't my job. That was amy's job.
I made the invitations.
and that fight in the hallway was adrian's way of trying to show amy how many girls ricky had slept with.
it has nothing to do with me.
you say you're friends with adrian, but i don't think you are.
I don't think you've ever really gotten over the fact that she and i had sex when you wouldt have sex with me.
and are we talking about oral sex or sex sex?
face it, jack. Our relationship was never gonna work out
after you two did whatever you two did.
and yet you had sex with me. - I wish i hadn't had sex with you.
and which was it, oral sex or sex sex?
Why? You still care about me?
your mom said i could talk to you for two minutes.
you know what? Two minutes would be too long.
good night.
I really hate you.
I really don't believe that.
you weren't even gonna invite me to adrian's shower?
it wasn't my place to invite anyone, okay?
Yes, it was. Adrian and grace made the invitation list to your shower.
did they?
Oh, yeah, maybe they did. That's why the neighbors were there.
Yeah, that's why the neighbors were there.
and this is why you're a complete ass.
okay, ashley.
I have heard enough bad things said about me tonight.
from just one person, or a lot of different people?
just one. Ben.
Ben came over here and told me off earlier,And I'm really not quite over it.
so i don't need you to make me feel badly about anything more, okay?
is that what's making you feel badly?
or are you still feeling badly from seeing all of ricky's lovers?
old lovers.
you hope they're old lovers.
I know they're old lovers, and i know they don't mean anything to him.
just like ben doesn't mean anything to you, so why should you care what he said?
he practically accused me of pretending to be in love with ricky
just so i could justify having slept with him in the first place.
Uh-huh. And?
and that's not true.
I was attracted to ricky at band camp,
and then i hated ricky for what happened at band camp,
and then i fell in love with ricky.
I love him. - The ricky in your imagination, or the real ricky who sleeps with everyone?
not everyone.
not you.
you know, i called adrian a few minutes ago to find out her side of the story,
and she said she was on the other line with ricky
and she'd have to call me back.
and you wanted to come and tell on ricky because?
because you blame me for kissing ricky, and that's because you don't think he could ever seriously be attracted to me.
and that hasn't made me feel so good...
for months.
so i took this opportunity to tell you.
Yeah.
you can't possibly see that kiss for what it really was a complete and total betrayal.
you really didn't care if you completely destroyed my relationship with ricky
just to have a little fun.
and you didn't really care if you completely destroyed this family
just to have a little fun at band camp.
Ben told you not to talk to me.
he did. But you know what, adrian?
as close as you and ben are,
you and me- We've known each other a lot longer than you and ben.
and you and me- We understand each other.
Yeah, i guess.
so what do you want? - I just wanna talk.
so talk.
did you really not know what you were doing When you were calling all those girls over in the hallway?
did you not know that that would be hurtful to amy
to have to look at a bunch of girls that i had sex with?
what, you think i called them all last night and told them to be out there this morning?
no. It just happened.
I mean, let's face it. You've been around.
know what i'm talking about? - Yes, i know what you're talking about. So were you just trying to hurt me?
I wasn't trying to hurt anyone, okay? I just want a shower.
I've never really had a party because girls don't like me.
and i want a party.
do you know why girls don't like you?
it doesn't matter. I just know that they don't.
because they don't, I feel kind of like i'm less than other people.
but, adrian, maybe girls would like you if you were nicer to them.
Yeah, i know.
but i never get a chance to be nice to them.
I don't have anyone to be nice to except for ben.
and i am really nice to ben.
Yeah, he's let everyone know, believe me.
come on, adrian.
I know that all this stuff goes back to your feeling
like all the kids in elementary school made fun of you because you didn't have nice clothes and all that.
but it's not elementary school, And you have to be a grown-Up now.
you gotta get over your insecurities.
but i am. - No. No, you're not.
just marrying ben is not gonna get you over your insecurities.
it may just make you feel more insecure.
what do you mean? - Nothing.
could you just go over and talk to amy before anyone gets hurt?
you know, i think amy doesn't want any more company tonight.
I think i'll let her get over her last company.
know what i mean? - No, i don't know what you mean.
what do you mean.
you don't mean ben was over there?
Ben really should've let you talk to me at school today.
thank you so much for letting me stay with you.
I think if I keep picturing her, she'll maybe show up here again.
if you're gonna be involved with Amy and the baby, I don't think I can see you anymore.
she's upset because I've decided to dothe responsible thing.
I wanna find my father.
my mom's here.
she doesn't know you're not living here.
adoption is not an option.
I should've told you.
it's kind of embarrassing having Alzheimer's when you can rember it.
I'm really gonna miss you.
I'm not going anywhere.
you know, we don't have to go tonight if you don't want us to. I don't have to, anyway.
no, you should go.
you should see your dad.
Why?
because he's your dad, and he asked to see you.
and Amy, you need to talk to him about schools, OK, because we have to make a decision.
I don't know what I wanna do about school, other than not going.
well, That's not really an option.
look, I don't understand why I can't call in sick for five months.
me, neither, but you can't.
so
do you know where he's taking you?
where?
did he tell you not to tell me?
OK, you guys have fun. OK?
I'm gonna have fun.
I mean I love having this house to myself.
we're just gonna hang out.
but hang out where?
you don't even wanna leave the house.
at his place. You know.
he has a place now.
Oh.
he has a place now.
Yeah, but I'm sure it's a real dump.
it better be.
Thanks, fellas. This was a really good idea.
I don't know why you volunteered,
but thank you.
I just want you to be able to see your daughters.
Oh, and don't tell my mom I let you do this.
are you kidding?
no. She'd kill me especially since you dumped her.
that's a good point.
Oh, Listen up, I'll be outta here by midnight, and my guys will waiting to bring the stuff back in,
I promise, all right?
and I owe you big time.
see ya.
here goes nothin'.
it's great, Dad.
Yeah, except for the fact that you got one bed for the two of us.
strange, with you owning a furniture store and all.
it came furnished.
it's a sublet kinda thing.
you konw, I don't wanna sign a long-term lease until I know what happens with your mother and me.
it's month-to-month.
besides, I thought it'd be fun if you konw you girls slept together like you did when you were kids.
Yeah, Dad, great.
we're not spending the night.
we never agreed to that.
I know, but sometime you might want to.
doubt it.
so you guys wanna get some pizzaor something? You wanna go out?
no, I definitely don't wanna go out.
I don't wanna run into anybody I know from school or band.
Amy, you're with me now.
if anybody looks at you or says anything to you,
I'll stick a rocket in their pocket and send 'em to the moon.
Thanks, Dad.
I appreciate your support.
do you mind if I call Ben?
Oh, you and Ben, you're still...
Yeah, we're still...
do you mind?
no, go ahead. That's good. I like Ben.
what?
so whose place is this, your girlfriend's?
what?
dad, it smells like perfume.
well, obviously girls used to live here.
that's a girl's room back there.
how do you know it's not a man's perfume you're smelling?
maybe it's just me you're smelling.
I think we all know your smell.
what kind of pizza you want?
I'm not hungry.
I can't go anywhere.
I don't wanna go anywhere.
what about if I came over there?
I'd love it if you came over here, but you konw, it's kinda creepy.
feels like I'm in someone else's home.
so is that a yes? Is it OK?
look, Ben, I'm dyingto see you, I really am. It's just...
I don't know how this thing works.
I'm pretty sure Ashley and I belong to my dad tonight.
you belong to me.
we belong to each other.
I have to see you.
I feel the same way.
I have to be here for my dad.
I see my mom every day. I just...
I have to at least spend one night with him.
I really wanna see you. It's just that...
I don't know.
come on. Ask your dad. He won't mind.
I can't.
I don't think I can share my time with him with you.
besides, we're supposed to talk about my plans, you konw what I'msupposed to do about school stuff.
but your dad likes me. I like him.
and we both love you.
I miss you. Ha-ha. I really miss you.
then ask him.
you konw it wouldn't be fair to Ashley.
what wouldn't be fair?
um, if Ben came over.
no one cares. Dad wants to know what kind of pizza you want.
sausage and peppers.
Hey, I'm on my way.
I'll ask for your address when I pick up the pizza. OK, bye.
well?
Hey. I didn't know you were coming over here.
um, listen, I gotta go drop off a pizza to Amy.
she's at her dad's condo, but, uh, make yourself at home.
Oh, Maybe I'll go with you.
uh, well, um...
Alice had to go to hergreat-aunt's.
it's hergreat-aunt's birthday. - Oh
um. Why didn't you go with her?
I didn't want to.
don't you usually go to all the family parties?
Yeah, usually.
why not this one?
if you don't want me to go with you, that's OK.
I can just go home.
no, no. It's not that I don't want you to go with me.
it's just that this is Amy's first visit with her dad since her dad and her mom split up, and I probably shouldn't even be going over there, so...
is everything OK?
Yeah, I'm OK.
no, something's wrong.
Yeah, something, but we can talk tomorrow.
you go to Amy's dad's, have fun, don't worry about me.
Oh, OK. Yeah, I really don't have time to talk.
I gotta go get the pizza.
you wanna come with?
Yeah, thanks.
I just wish you had told me that this is what we were gonna do.
I told my parents we were getting pizza.
we got pizza. It's in the back seat.
I know, but I didn't tell them the whole truth, and I've already been ina lot of trouble for not telling them the whole truth.
you think if we would've told 'em we were going to look for my father, they would've let you come with me?
I kinda doubt it.
but maybe my dad would've come with us to do this.
my dad's really good at confronting people in difficult situations.
thought your parents were out on their corny date night.
I don't think it's corny.
I think it's kinda romantic.
please.
date night's for people who aren't having sex.
Oh, my parents have plenty of sex.
how do you know?
I'm just assuming.
Where's your brother? Where's Tom?
he's home alone.
it's another reason why I don't feel comfortable staying out too late.
I mean he has been home by himself before, but still...
I told my parents we wouldn't be gone too long.
I just wanna see what the guy looks like.
you konw I'm not gonna cause a big scene or anything.
what?
what time can I see you?
I told you, I'm busy.
come on, Adrian. I can't go this long without you, or someone.
Thanks. I'm sure you mean that as a compliment.
look, I told you, I can't tonight.
why not?
I just can't, OK?
Oh, and don't bother calling Grace. She's with me.
good night.
I, uh, talked to Jack earlier.
actually, I've talked to him all week about you.
OK, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that, but thank you for telling me.
of course I'm gonna tell you.
because we're friends, right?
and Jack and I are friends.
right.
I just don't get why he can call you, but he can't call me.
cause he's tired of being rejected, and he's waiting for you to call him.
the guy is madly in love with you.
call him, take him back.
I don't know. Just doesn't feel right now.
too much time has passed.
is that the problem?
too much time has passed?
or is the problem that you like Ricky?
I know, you like Ricky,
but you know I like Ricky, and like I told you the first time I met you
we're having sex.
I know that, and I'm not interested in having sex with Ricky, and he's not interested in having sex with me.
we're just friends.
come on, Grace. Ricky does not have friends.
Ricky makes friends with girls he wants to have sex with.
Ricky and I are just friends, and he's not gonna try to have sex with me.
Mm-hmm, I'm sure that's the same thing
Amy Juergens was thinking the night she had sex with him.
poor Amy.
no. Poor Ricky, poor baby, not poor Amy.
a girl should know how to take care of herself.
how hard is it not to get pregnant?
I don't know.
then stay away from Ricky.
Hello?
Hey, what are you doing tonight?
who is this?
you know who it is.
why are you calling me?
I just need someone to talk to, Lauren.
about what?
about what else - Amy and the baby.
I have to talk to someone, someone who has her best interest at heart.
I'm not gonna talk to you.
why not?
you didn't seem to have any trouble talking to me last week when you wanted to talk to me.
now I wanna talk to you.
I'm busy.
doing what?
you're not doing anything, are you?
Yes, I am.
can we go out and just talk, please?
you're out of your mind, you know that?
Hi. - Hi.
I thought you were going out with Jason.
Oh, I am. I just didn't tell my dad.
Oh. Why not?
I don't know. I like it better this way.
you konw he just dropped me off.
he thinks I'm spending the night like always.
so, where's Jason taking you?
to the movies, then to get a pizza.
that swanky pizza joint is donating money to the school for every student who buys a pizza tonight, so...
pizza and a movie.
original.
you can't go. No offense.
I don't wanna go. No offense.
are you sure?
I'm sure.
do you have any friends you could fix her up with?
her? Uh, no, I don't.
I can get my own date.
Really?
I can.
OK.
well, you know what?
I will help you find a date next week.
you got me a date. It's the least I can do.
I said I can get my own date.
when I'm ready, OK?
OK.
OK. Uh, we should go.
we don't wanna wait around till she finds a date, 'cause that could take years.
as much as I appreciate the pity,
I don't think either one of you have been on an official date, have you?
Yeah, so go. Get outta here.
I got things to do.
well, good night.
good night.
good night.
who is it?
I heard you were home alone.
thought I'd drop by.
maybe we could talk.
I'm Leo, Ben's dad.
Anne, Amy's mom.
this a bad time?
no, no. Come in, please.
I, uh, I should've called first, at least. I apologize.
Oh, no. I apologize for looking like this.
I'd go change and clean myself up a bit, but, um...
I don't really feel like it 'cause...
because your mom just got diagnosed with Alzheimer's and you and your husband are having problems and your lovely daughter has gotten herself into a little bit of trouble and the girls are going to visit their dad for the first time since you split up and because that wine doesn't go with that cereal.
Aw... it's OK.
everything's gonna be all right.
so how do you like the pizza, Mr. Juergens?
you can call me George.
could you pass me another slice, George?
not you. You call me Mr. Juergens.
Mr. Juergens.
that's more like it.
dad...
he's kidding.
Oh.
it's good pizza.
Oh, yeah, it's Fianno's.
Fianno's? Where's Fianno's? I never heard of that.
it's a place my dad likes to go to.
he actually arranged this thing with the school where they donate money to the school for any business they bring in tonight.
I should do that with my store.
donate money for any sales the students bring in.
that's a good idea.
we should bring a piece to Ashley.
what's your name again?
it's Henry, Dad.
I'm just kidding.
why you so down, Harry? What's up?
girlfriend problems.
Thanks.
girlfriend break up with you?
did she?
no. No.
you ever meet Amy's sister?
no.
Oh. She is the shyest little girl just a couple years younger t han you three but the sweetest, nicest cherub you'd ever wanna meet.
you konw when she heard you and Ben were coming over, she ran to the back room like a scared little kitten.
Hey, do me a favor.
would you bring my little angel a slice of pizza.
Oh. OK.
Thanks, Harry.
what do you want?
your dad asked me to bring you some pizza.
put it down, then back out of the room with your hands over your head.
no.
I won't back out of the room with my hands over my head, because I'm tired of people telling me what to do and when to do it and when not to do it.
I'm a man, damn it.
well, in that case, ou can stay.
well, OK.
who is it?
Hey, buddy.
Hey. Is Grace home?
no. She's out with Adrian.
Really? Your parents let her go out with Adrian?
maybe I could wait for her.
I have a friend coming over.
you have a friend coming over? Like a date?
good for you.
do you have any idea where Grace and Adrian went?
maybe they are at Adrian's house.
Yeah, maybe they are. Thanks.
maybe you should write him a letter first.
maybe.
or maybe you should call him and see how he feels about meeting you.
maybe.
Adrian, I'm sorry. I don't feel comfortable doing this.
I think we should go.
I've waited 16 years for this.
you can't wait another few minutes?
OK.
what exactly are we waiting for?
I just wanna see the guy, OK?
how do you even know it's the right guy?
Finally!!
sorry, Tom. Busy night.
the high school gets credit for every pizza any student orders tonight.
it's been a little crazy.
Yeah.
here you go.
Tom, that's a lot of money.
you want more?
Oh, no. I'm just saying, careful with your cash.
thanks for the tip.
Ha-ha. Thanks for the tip. I get it. Funny.
good Night, Tom.
hello.
Hi, Tom. It's me. I'm checking to see how you are.
I'm fine.
do you need me to come home?
no.
are you sure?
Yes.
I just thought you might be scared there all by yourself.
no.
he says he's OK, but I don't know.
look, I know this is really hard for you, but what if the the guy sees us sitting outside his house?
feel better now?
Yeah.
haven't really had anyone to talk to.
I mean, I don't know.
what are we gonna do, Anne?
they're in love.
it's wonderful they're in love, but they're just 15 years old.
it's complicated.
or not.
she's gonna be a mother. We accept that, Ben and me.
he wants her in his life and I want her in his life.
she's a nice girl.
thank you.
I think I'm just still in shock.
I don't understand it.
it seems so unlikely that she would...
have sex, yeah.
I think most of us feel that way about our children, our teenagers.
I spoke to the counselor at school.
marc Molina, yeah. Nice guy.
he said there's an extension class she can go to with other girls who are...
is that what you want?
no.
I want this not to be happening.
but it is, and it's gonna be happening whether she goes to extension class or she's home schooled or goes back to her old school.
Oh, I don't think Amy could do that.
she could if she wanted, if you wanted.
I can't even get her to leave the house anymore.
she's gotta get over that.
she can't hide her face in shame. What happened happened.
like I said before, she's a good girl, and I mean that.
she is.
she is a good girl.
and you're a good mother, and you'll get through this and Amy will get through this.
but don't let her hide from people, and don't you hide from people.
don't make it so important.
it is what it is, you know?
you want me to get her a private tutor so she could stay home and get her schooling, and I'll do it.
you want to send her to a private school or-or a different school, just let me know I got connections.
but, please, don't let Amy feel like she's any less of a person than she was before this happened,
because she's not, and neither are you.
just live with it, Anne.
if you don't mind me sayin' that, just live with it.
because there's nothing you could do.
just accept that things are what they are, and that's OK.
and if I could help you in any way, please, just let me know.
Thanks.
so, did you wanna talk or something, or...
are you just content to sit there and stare at me?
I'm OK just staring at you.
I don't guess that, uh, at 13, you're allowed to date or anything?
are you kidding?
after Amy, I don't think I'll be allowed to date till I'm 21 unless I undergo some voluntary sterilization or something.
that would be a shame.
why is that?
I don't know.
you're really pretty.
come on.
well, I mean, you know you're pretty, right?
I mean, you're beautiful.
you may be the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
just shut up, OK?
you don't know that?
please - Please don't tell anyone, OK?
never.
I've-I've been through a lot lately.
I love Stephane Grappelli.
you do? - Yeah, I love him.
Oh, with, uh, what's his name?
uh, oh, - Yeah. - Yeah.
Oh, God. Amazing.
Yeah. I don't think there's anything like the two of them.
unless it's the two of us.
who?
uh, Stephane Grappelli and Django Reinhardt?
they're jazz musicians. Or, they used to be.
Yeah, I know who they are.
no, you don't. - Oh, yeah.
stephane Grappelli is on a Pink Floyd album
wish You Were Here.
it's true. - Dad.
pink Floyd? - Look it up, cool cat.
OK. - Dad.
what?
let's just change the subject.
so, have you thought any more about coming back to school?
Oh, yeah. No, I can't do that.
well, other than home schooling, what are your options?
should I be here while you and Ben are discussing your educational future?
right. Um, that's probably something you'd like to discuss with Amy and her mother without me.
maybe I'll just go find out what happened to Henry, and maybe we'll be going.
maybe.
but it's been great seein' ya.
I'm sorry.
probably should have asked if Ben could come over.
no, it's OK.
I just wanna spend a little time with you and Ashley myself.
what do you think's goin' on in there?
I don't know.
look, Amy, I know high school students stink, but that's your school.
and if you wanna go back to your school instead of being sent out to the edge of the village for some extension class or something, then claim your rights.
you go back to school with Ben and your friends, and you hold your head up high.
I want to. Dad, I can't.
I really - I can't. I'm not that brave.
Yes, you are.
and you're already past the worst part of this.
you told me.
now that I know, everything else is a piece of cake.
no. It isn't.
kids at my school are mean.
you're not mean. You're a little bit
you're a little opinionated about some things but you're not mean
and you love me.
kids at my school do not love me.
I do, Amy.
I love you very much.
and Ashley and... even your mother.
but...
I've made some mistakes.
Yep. So have I, Dad.
Oh, sweetie.
Oh, uh, I'll get that.
it's probably a neighbor.
no one knows I've moved in yet.
Adrian, it's me.
I brought you and Grace a pizza.
is that Ricky?
I really didn't think this through.
dad, you're dating Adrian?
Adrian's mother is a friend of mine.
well, she was a friend of mine.
I said I'd made some mistakes.
people make mistakes.
I told my mom you were bringing by a book I need to write my paper.
I don't have a book.
Yeah, you do.
nice work.
I brought you a pizza.
I'm not hungry.
suit yourself, but I got it for you.
Yeah, sure you did.
and I'm sure you just wanna talk.
I do.
I'm not doing anything with you.
I'm not asking you to do anything with me but talk.
so start talking.
my girlfriend -or ex-girlfriend Adrian hates me.
Amy hates me. Everyone hates me.
so?
so I think more people will hate me if I have to walk the hallways with a pregnant Amy Juergens walkin' the same hallways.
so I was just thinkin', can't you convince Amy it's not a good idea for her to come back to school?
you know it's not a good idea.
because her continuing her education will cut into your social life.
Yeah. But I don't want her ridiculed.
I don't want anyone makin' fun of the woman carrying my child.
look, no one's gonna say anything to me 'cause... I'm me.
but Amy...
she's a movin' target.
well, what do you know? We agree on something.
Yeah. I don't even know why she decided to have the baby.
we both know we made a mistake.
we both know we're not ready to be parents.
now I'm forced into takin' care of her, takin' care of both of 'em.
guess you should have been more careful.
I should have been more careful, she should have been more careful.
Yeah, you both should have been more careful, but you weren't.
now you are both responsible for bringing a child into this world.
jealous?
Oh, yeah, I am jealous because I am dying to be a teenaged mother, because that's what every girl wants to be.
I meant are you jealous that I had sex with her?
no.
are you sure?
kinda got the impression from you and Madison that you're both jealous.
you know, not every girl wants you.
Yeah, some girls think you are an uncaring, heartless jerk.
some girls, yeah.
come on.
I'm not a total jerk, am I?
what's a girl as good-lookin' as you doin' home on a Saturday night alone anyway?
I see right through this, you know that?
I know that.
and still, here you are.
well. - Hi.
well, hi yourself.
are you Tom?
are you Betty?
Yeah, I'm Betty.
you know, it's gonna cost you money if you want me to be your friend, you know.
OK.
I just have a feeling something is going on.
I really have to go home, Adrian.
if I'm not home by midnight, my parents are gonna kill me.
Oh, Lord, keep us safe from harm.
hi there.
Hi.
my wife says you've been parked out here all night.
what do you want?
yeah?
are you Adrian Lee?
Yeah.
my agreement with your mother is that this would never happen.
please don't come around here again.
I have a family.
Hey. - Hey.
Oh, God, you too?
what do you mean, "you too"?
you're cheating on Dad?
Leo, Ben's Dad, came by.
Why?
I don't know. He just wanted to make sure that I knew that he was OK with you and Ben going out.
he came over just to tell you that?
couldn't he just call or send some sausage servant to tell you?
let's get back to "you too." Is your father dating someone?
did he bring someone over while you guys were there?
no.
but he is dating. I mean, or he was, anyway.
who?
you know.
he's having an affair with Adrian's mother.
you know, Adrian, the slut, the majorette, drummer's girlfriend.
slut must run in the family.
you know what, Ashley?
dad said that he would tell her.
mom, Dad's not having an affair. He's not even dating anyone.
they might have dated, like, once or twice, but they're just friends.
he borrowed her condo so we could hang out tonight.
when do you stop being so gullible?
when the baby arrives?
why can't you both just be like normal parents and get addicted to Internet orn or something?
why do you have to get involved with other parents?
what about you, princess?
why do you have to get involved with my friends' friends?
Henry has a girlfriend.
Alice and him have been dating since third grade.
she broke up with him.
Alice broke up with Henry?
damn it, I'm no better than Madison and Lauren.
I don't want you two girls using that kind of language, OK?
mom, I'm pregnant, and you're worried I'm gonna use bad words?
Yes. No. I...
I don't know what I'm saying, OK?
I just found out that your father has a girlfriend.
it's one thing to suspect something like that.
it's another thing to have it confirmed by your own daughters.
he made a mistake.
he said that? To you?
Yes.
mom, Adrian's mom is out of town all the time.
she's a flight attendant. She travels a lot.
somehow Dad convinced Adrian to let us borrow her condo 'cause he knew I didn't want to go out anywhere.
he just did it for me because he knew I didn't want anyone to see me like this.
besides, Dad's just living at the furniture store.
wait, What? When did he say that?
he didn't tell me that.
Yes, cause you were hiding in the back room like a little baby.
maybe if you hadn't acted like a child all night, you would have known.
you think you're so grown up just 'cause you're having a baby.
OK, stop it.
wait. Wait a minute.
he's living in the furniture store?
why isn't he staying in a hotel, or an apartment
Oh, no.
No!
no, no, no.
mom?
dad's not living with Adrian's mom.
OK? He's not.
Oh, no.
what?
dad didn't, um, mention anything about being broke, did he?
what?
well, why else would he be living at the furniture store?
OK, Mom, you have to let him come home.
I don't mind people knowing that she's having a baby and he's having an affair and you're doing whatever with Ben's dad, but I do mind people knowing that we're poor.
that is the ultimate humiliation.
what, are we so poor that he has to sleep at his own store?
please, Mom, just let him come home. Please.
I don't understand why you guys think he's broke or we're broke or whatever.
maybe Dad just enjoys sleeping at his furniture store.
now you see how she got in trouble.
just when I thought things could not get any worse.
mom, You have to go get him.
you cannot let him display our poverty to the public, OK?
it's just - I can take a lot of things, but I cannot take that. I just cannot.
but, Ashley, I don't want him here. OK?
I really don't want him here.
mom, I hate him as much as you do, OK?
but we can't just make him look like a big loser.
we're all gonna look like big losers.
is that what you want? The whole world is gonna pity us.
I just can't.
mom, I am asking you.
let him come home.
it's just for a while, please.
please.
OK, Ashley, but I'm not calling him, OK?
you have to call him.
and it's just till we figure something else out.
the refreshments are delicious.
Oh, yes.
no smoking. It's bad for you.
Oh, I know, but believe me, this is not the most dangerous part of my job.
I mean, I hope I live long enough to die of lung cancer.
want one?
have you smoked before?
no.
Oh, you know what?
Yeah, you know, it might make you sick, Tom.
it's very addictive.
you smoke one, you know, seems like nothing.
you smoke another one.
Ah, no big deal.
then you smoke a third one. Blammo, you're hooked.
and it is very, very difficult to quit.
that's a good idea.
Tom, I need you to know something.
if you don't p me the money, a very mean guy is gonna come and beat you up with a bag of oranges that he keeps in his trunk.
so you need to pay me the money. I gotta pay him.
he doesn't let me keep the money, you know.
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
well, now you know, and that's what friends are for
to tell you stuff like that.
you wanna know something else?
OK.
OK. Well, lots of the girls are addicted to drugs, all kinds of terrible, terrible drugs.
and that's why they need the money.
it's a very, very dirty business, and most of the men who call me, they're not very nice.
and if they were nice, they would have, like, a girlfriend or a - or - right? - or a wife or something, right? But they don't.
you really hit the jackpot when you got me.
Yeah, but there's a lot of other girls on the website that - they're not nice.
they don't care about you, and they're not your friend.
and they'd come into your beautiful home, and they rob your family.
so will you do me a favor?
will you stay away from those websites?
cause someone's gonna take advantage of you.
will you promise me?
I love my sausage pizza.
and I really liked our conversation.
that's gonna be $200.
Hi.
thank you.
who's this?
here, take that back.
how are you?
good night, Tom.
beautiful home. - Oh, thanks.
Tom, who is that?
she's a friend.
like Ricky.
he came here tonight.
Really? What'd he say? What was he wearing?
so when are you gonna break up with Alice?
I don't know, but the sooner, the better.
maybe you should sleep on it. Maybe you'll feel differently tomorrow.
no, I want it over with.
I want it over with by tomorrow.
you've known her since the third grade. This is Alice.
she's just not somebody you "get over with.
not everyone is as lucky as you are.
some people get stuck in relationships they don't want to be in just because they're too scared to let go of it, I don't wanna be like that.
I'm too young to be like that.
if I'm never as lucky as you, if I never find someone, if I never fall in love, then... at least
I will have tried to get what you have.
the perfect girl, who's pregnant by some other guy.
I'm sorry, Ben.
I forgot for a minute.
it's OK.
you're not changing your mind, are you?
no.
never.
she hasn't even tried to call me.
she totally takes me for granted, and I'm tired of it, I'm just tired of it.
then break up with her, but be nice about it.
I mean, Alice is tough on the outside, but she's gonna be really upset. You know that, right?
I know, I know, but what can I do?
I can't do this anymore, and I have to break up with her.
I have to.
OK.
what?
Alice didn't by chance break up with you, did she?
Yeah.
Hey.
your friend Ricky dropped by.
blew my cover.
let me ask you something.
how does a guy stay married to a woman for 15 years and have two daughters with her and then just walk away
have we ever had a conversation?
I don't think so, so I don't think we'll be starting with that one.
why not? I wanna know.
why do you wanna know?
because that's what my father did.
he just walked away, and he never looked back.
and he knows I'm here -he knows - and he acts like I don't even exist.
Oh, Adrian, oh, honey, it's OK. Don't cry. Don't cry.
you got your mother.
she'll be home in a couple of days.
it's one thing to cheat on Mom.
it's another thing to cheat on Amy and me.
I'm never gonna speak to you as long as I live, you got it?
tell him he can stay at the house if he can't afford to stay anywhere else and if he isn't still with your mother and if he's... really living at the store.
I left my cell phone in your room.
go home.
what's the point now?
the point is if you want forgiveness, eventually they'll forgive you.
if my father ever came to me and asked me to forgive him,
I would forgive him.
not me.
good night.
come on over.
don't do anything stupid, Ricky. Don't hit the guy. It's okay.
it's never gonna be okay. -Yeah, probably not.
my father is not a law-abiding citizen.
he doesn't care if there's a restraining order.
here's my dad's number. He'll help you.
I want to consider adoption. I'd appreciate you going along with that.
I found something for you to do for your community service.
how'd you like to mentor a kid?
Yeah, I'll do it.
you know how much some families would pay for a healthy, Caucasian baby?
I gotta go.
no-- Whoa, whoa.
no, you can't just have sex like that and leave me here alone.
sorry. Then again, I think you say that every time I leave your house, so maybe you can just not say anything for once.
are you angry with me?
after that?
I'm not angry with you.
you're angry.
Yeah, well, I'm angry with someone else.
good night.
no, wait, please, just wait.
who are you angry with? Grace?
no, not Grace. Good night.
no. Ricky.
how can you be angry with anyone after what we just did?
I just can, all right? I have to go.
Ricky, please.
this is as close as I've ever felt to you.
tonight. In there.
just talk to me, please.
I don't feel like talking to you. It's personal.
more personal than sex?
Yeah, a lot more personal than sex.
come on, Ricky.
look, just don't run away tonight, okay?
just talk to me.
just tell me what this is about. You can tell me.
I can't.
you can if you want.
I'm not gonna tell anyone.
whatever it is, I'm not gonna say anything.
don't you know me better than that by now?
no. And you don't know me either.
well, then let's get to know each other.
okay, you want to get to know me?
you want to know who I am?
the reason I'm in foster care is not just because my dad smacked me around and smacked my mom around.
it's not just because they were both drug addicts, and abandoned me over and over again.
it's because my dad used to come home after a long day of hanging out and getting high to teach me a little lesson in how hard it is to be a man in this world.
that's what he called it: "A little lesson."
every night, I'd be in bed with my door closed, just begging God that he wouldn't come in my room for one of his little lessons.
but night after night after night, there he was.
and when I couldn't take it anymore, when I hated him enough, when I really didn't care if I lived or died,
I told my teacher at school and she told someone, and then they told someone else.
and eventually, but believe me, not quickly, eventually, he went off to prison.
but guess what? He's back, and he's hanging around.
Yeah.
he went to see Amy and then he came around when I was with Grace, so lock your doors, because he'll probably show up here too.
not that he's interested in you or Grace or Amy.
no, he's just interested in me.
in hurting me.
he actually wants me to make someone pay for my baby and then give him the money.
then he'll leave me alone.
nice, huh?
Ricky, I'm so sorry.
let me help you, okay?
I-- I can talk to my dad.
he can help you.
no one can help me.
everything okay?
no.
what's wrong?
Ricky was just here.
And?
did you know?
did I know what?
that his father was in prison for sexually abusing him and for drugs and for God knows what else?
I can't discuss that.
but you knew.
I knew.
then put him back in prison.
honey, I can't.
he's on parole.
and as long as he follows the conditions of his parole, there's nothing I can do.
I don't believe that.
have the cops follow him around.
make him break the conditions of his parole.
as an officer of the court,
I cannot mandate any law-enforcement agency to spend an exorbitant amount of resources on one individual who, if he's following the parole agreement, he's not an apparent danger to anyone.
Really? You believe that?
he's not an apparent danger to anyone?
dad, please.
I'm doing the best I can, honey.
what are you doing?
what's it look like? I'm shaving.
I can see that, but why are you shaving in my kitchen?
I'm tired of shaving with the garden hose.
my skin's getting chapped.
George, there are three bathrooms in this house.
Yeah, and three women.
[Sighs] Good morning.
morning, Buttercup.- Good morning.
do you think it's okay if I go to a friend's house after school?
a friend's house after school?
you have a friend?
you're not thinking the same thing?
I think it's wonderful that you have a friend and that you're getting out of the house and doing something with someone outside the family.
so, what's her name?
what makes you so sure it's a her?
Oh. So it's a boyfriend friend?
no, it's a gender-non-specific friend.
what's going on?
your sister has a friend.
Really?
Yes, really.
why is it such a surprise that I have a friend?
I'm a very, very friendly person.
all right, well, um,
I'll just-- I'll be in the car.
so I'll pick you up after last period, okay?
Yeah. Sounds good.
I can pick her up. - No, you can't.
you're working, George.
at least I hope you are.
I can still pick her up.
I have a doctor's appointment.
she said I might be able to find out the sex of the baby today.
Really? And then you'll tell me. I'd love to have a boy.
I got two girls, so a grandson would be great.
you know, or a granddaughter.
Bye.
what?
she's leaning towards adoption. You know that.
that's already been decided?
no, it hasn't, but I think it's what she wants.
what she wants or what you want?
I think it's really what she wants, George.
she isn't sure she wants to know if it's a boy or a girl.
is this because of Ricky?
she doesn't want Ricky and his dad coming around?
did you scare her with that?
no. I didn't.
it's about nothing except for the fact that Amy thinks that this might be the best choice for her baby.
let's go, let's go. I got things to do today.
Oh, yeah. Me too.
what's with the camera?
we're finding out the sex of the baby.
and according to the information I got from the Internet, this is a moment that should be recorded for history.
by? - By...?
Amy's borrowing your camera, right?
no. I'm gonna be there with her.
you're gonna be there when she finds out the sex of the baby?
Yeah. Of course.
you know how they find that out?
Yeah. It's called a sonogram.
Yeah. And she's gonna be laying on a table with her whole stomach exposed.
have you seen Amy's stomach before?
well, that's kind of a personal question, isn't it?
not as personal as you being there and seeing her stomach.
they can cover it. -They don't cover it.
it-- It'll be fine.
I mean, it's-- It's just a stomach.
no, it's not.
it's a very intimate moment between the mother and the baby, and usually the father of the baby.
and it's very emotional.
I mean, given Amy's situation,
I would think she'd feel really vulnerable at a moment like that and would be much more comfortable with her mother there than you.
she wants me to be there. - You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure. - I don't recommend it.
it'll be fine.
I'm not worried about you as much as Amy.
I can't imagine that she would want you there.
she's my wife. I know, I know. We're not married legally, but we might as well be.
we're in love and we're in this relationship for life.
and this is a big part of that relationship, today, finding out the sex of the baby.
I have to be there. Amy wants me to be there.
just like she wants me there for the birth.
Yeah, okay, Benjamin.
we'll see about that.
we'll see about what?
come on. Let's go, already.
be there for the birth.
come on.
what do you call this again?
Earl Grey.
it's not bad.
I have coffee.
no, no, no. That's okay.
when in Rome...
well, I'm very happy you stopped by.
I wish my wife were here to talk to you.
she's, uh-- Well, she's been wanting to talk to you.
but neither of us wanted to intrude on the situation.
I don't know why not. The whole world has intruded.
it's not like it's a secret.
so, what do you think Amy is going to do?
is she thinking about adoption?
Ricky said she's thinking about it, but I'm not sure he's totally onboard with that right now, especially since his father has been coming around looking for money from the adoption.
Bob the child molester is looking for money for the baby?
maybe Ricky didn't tell Amy, but yes.
Bob said he'd help out financially.
Bob has no money.
Bob the child molester is also Bob the drug addict.
that son of a-- I want to
we do too.
but we all know we can't.
do we? Maybe that's just the tea talking.
Adrian's father
do you know Adrian?
I know him. What about Adrian?
is her father a child molester too?
no, no.
he's the DA.
he got us a restraining order, and he's asked the police to keep an eye out.
what, in case anyone kills Bob?
let's not resort to violence.
let's not put ourselves on Bob's level.
let's put Bob down a level. Like six feet under.
he wanted money for the baby?
Mr. Juergens, Bob will not last long in the real world.
sooner or later, he's gonna do something that will violate his parole and he'll go back to prison.
should we do something to Bob before Bob does something to go back to prison?
there's nothing we can do.
no? There's gotta be something we can do.
I'm not gonna sit around drinking Earl Grey, waiting for Bob to go back to prison.
don't do anything stupid, George.
Yeah, story of my life.
so that's why he showed up at the batting cages.
he wants money from the adoption.
so you and Amy have decided to have the baby adopted?
no, at least I haven't.
I don't want anything to do with an adoption, which is only gonna make Bob angry.
I mean, he's an angry man already.
look, I wouldn't want to ruin your morning, so I'll spare you the details of what my father did to me.
Ricky, you can tell us anything.
don't worry about our morning, okay?
it's not okay.
I was sexually abused, and Bob got sent to prison because of me, so I don't think Grace should be around me.
I don't think it's safe.
...Ricky, uh,
Bob was sent to prison because of Bob.
didn't have anything to do with you. You know that, don't you?
Yeah, I know that.
intellectually, I know that.
but still, sometimes it gets turned around in my head somehow.
look, I'm working on my problems.
I'm in therapy. I've been in therapy for years.
and I know I'd never do anything to hurt Grace.
but I can't say the same about Bob.
I can't say he wouldn't hurt her if he had the chance.
I think he just wants to get back at me.
I just don't know how he plans to do that.
so I'm not gonna come around for a while and I was wondering if you could explain that to Grace.
I can't. I just can't.
I really love her, but I don't want her to get hurt.
but Bob is very unpredictable.
Ricky, are you sure you can't tell Grace this yourself?
we can tell her, but she can hear what you have to say without any judgment. She can.
Yeah, because she's a Christian. You're all Christians.
I wish I could be a Christian.
I wish I could believe what you believe.
I wish Jesus would just take away my pain and suffering, but I spent too many nights praying for Bob to leave me alone to believe that prayer ever works.
no, I think you better tell Grace that I can't see her anymore.
not right now, anyway.
look, I have to go. I'm sorry. I have to go.
no pity, okay?
I don't need pity. It'll change the sex.
I'm not-- It's not pity.
it's just that
I don't know, I just
I think I understand you a lot better now.
I doubt it.
besides, I'm not looking for understanding.
I know what you're looking for.
and you're not gonna get that from Grace.
I'm not seeing Grace. I went over to her house and told her parents that I'd stay away from her.
and I'm gonna stay away from her.
because of your dad, or because she really isn't what you want?
or because rejection in any form is just gonna make her want you more?
I'm not that complicated.
Yes, you are.
Hey, don't make too much out of what I told you about my dad, okay?
okay.
tonight?
he wants to make money off the adoption.
he wants Ricky to give him a commission on selling Amy's baby.
what?
that's why he showed up. He wants to get a cut of the money.
nobody's getting any money for Amy's baby.
apparently people do that.
they pay for hospital costs and taking care of the mother.
sometimes there's some sort of cash bonus involved, disguised as an expense.
Reverend Stone didn't say anything about that.
that's not gonna happen.
how do you know it's not gonna happen?
how do you know that there's not gonna be money under the table to Ricky?
with Bob in the picture, adoption is a dirty business.
you're the one who wanted her to do this, not me.
it doesn't have to be a dirty business.
it's not supposed to be a dirty business.
it's supposed to be a wonderful way of providing a child with a-- A stable and loving family and giving two people a chance to have a child who would ordinarily not be able to have one.
it's just people like Ricky's father that make it into a dirty business.
we won't have anything to do with him or anyone like him.
how are we gonna know?
we'll know.
George, don't do anything stupid, please.
Amy is gonna need you.
you need to be here for Amy.
don't do anything stupid.
what kind of a man abuses his own son? Pervert.
a very sick man.
someone who needs some help.
Oh, I'll help him.
George, let the authorities handle this, please.
you know, if Bob did what he did to Ricky, then Ricky could do what he did to the baby.
that's not fair.
and it's not true.
it doesn't have to be that way. Just because Ricky was abused doesn't mean he's gonna do the same thing.
Ricky can be different from his father.
get out your dreamcatcher, because you're dreaming again.
Dreamcatcher
so, what time is your appointment?
same time as usual. As soon as I can get there after school.
so am I riding with you and your mom, or should I have my dad's driver drop me off, or how does that work?
Oh, and I have a digital camera, but don't worry,
I won't take pictures unless you want me to.
uh, you want me to be there, right?
you said you wanted me to be there, didn't you?
no, I said I wish you could be there.
well, I can.
n-no, I wish you could be there. Like
like I wish we were married, legally.
like I wish this was our baby.
like I wish a lot of things.
so you
you don't want me to be there.
it's kind of personal.
Yeah, I-- I know. But still...
but still think you should go?
Yeah. Ben, I -- I don't know.
I mean, you've never even seen my stomach before.
I know. It'll be the first time I see your stomach.
I'm sure it will be awkward, but I want to be there for you.
I want to see the baby.
I want to be there with you when you find out whether it's a girl or a boy.
and, yeah, at first, it'll be awkward, but we'll work through the awkwardness.
we love each other.
I don't think so, Ben.
I-I don't even know if I want to know if it's a boy or a girl.
I'm not even sure I want to be there.
I know it's gonna be a very emotional moment for you, and that's why I want to be there for you.
but just think about letting me go.
just think about it.
no. I don't want to think about it.
I don't want to hurt your feelings, but I don't want you to be there.
sorry. I just think it would be awkward.
are you gonna let me go to birthing classes?
again, I think that would be awkward.
so you don't want me there when the baby is born.
in the room when I'm completely exposed to the world?
no. I-- I'm not even sure I want my mother to be there.
we don't have to make these decisions now.
I mean, we have months to think about it.
but please, just consider the possibility of letting me be there when the baby is born.
I-- I mean, I can stay up by your head, all the way up by your head and I won't look at anything you don't want me to see.
Yeah, okay. I'll-- I'll think about it.
I love you.
I love you too.
coming.
coming.
Hi. I knew if I called, you'd tell me not to come over.
Yeah, I probably would.
since you're here... - Really?
I always wondered what this house would look like on the inside.
it's very you.
Yeah. Well, I bought my own furniture this time around.
that's a great rocking chair. Where'd you get that?
my husband bought it for me when I had Grace.
this would be a great idea for a baby gift.
what's up, George?
Oh, we gotta talk.
about?
Ricky's dad.
Yeah. I want to kill that guy.
me too. - No, George,
I don't mean that literally.
Oh. I do.
what do you mean, literally?
I mean, I hate what he did to that kid.
Yeah, and Ricky could do that to his kid, and his kid is my grandson or granddaughter, and I can't ignore the fact that his father is circling around.
Ricky came by to say that he can't go out with Grace anymore.
he doesn't want to put her in jeopardy.
your daughter could be my daughter's baby's stepmother.
we're a long way from that. A long, long way.
grace is going to college and then to medical school.
George, what do you want?
I want to know how we're getting rid of Bob.
don't you two have a plan to get rid of him?
rid of him? No. We're gonna leave that up to the authorities.
I won't do that.
uh, yeah. We have to.
you're no better than Anne.
I hope your next wife shares your point of view.
well, I can only hope so. Thanks for nothing.
Hey, there.
don't get out.
all right.
I want to talk to you.
great.
I'm taking Amy to the doctor today to find out the sex of her baby.
yeah? - Yeah.
and I also found out that you're trying to get money for Amy's baby.
so, uh, I don't know. Maybe it's the doctor's appointment, or everything else that's happening, but that news just kind of upset me.
well, it's not just her baby. There's a father, and that's my son.
so it's actually your daughter's baby and my son's baby.
so who knows? Maybe someday, we'll be in-laws.
we are never gonna be in-laws.
and you're not gonna go anywhere near my daughter or your son or their baby.
you got that?
because if you do, if you go near her or him or the baby, you're gonna regret it.
Really?
regret it, you say?
listen to me.
I'm a woman on the verge.
my 15-year-old daughter is having a baby.
my husband is having an affair.
I'm getting a divorce after 16 years of marriage.
I gotta get a job.
and my mom has Alzheimer's.
and I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it if one more bad thing happens to me, like if I find out that you're sending couples over to try to adopt the baby and you're somehow making money off of it.
so, what are you saying, Anne? Are you saying--?
I don't know. Are you threatening me?
not nice to threaten people.
I'm not threatening you.
I don't even know how to threaten a man like you.
but I figure you're afraid of me.
I figure you're afraid of everything and everyone, because what kind of a man hits his own wife and child?
I'll tell you what kind.
a coward.
what kind of a man preys on innocent children?
a coward.
Yeah, that's right. You're a coward.
I bet you get high so you can forget that.
that you're a coward.
am I right?
just don't go near them, any of them.
just go away.
go far, far away.
Hey, were you looking for me?
Yeah.
I've been looking for you all day.
I'm sorry, Grace.
I just don't think we should be seeing each other right now.
okay, but that's just for right now, right?
it's for as long as my dad is around.
my parents told me.
they told you?
everything.
really, I appreciate that you don't want me to get hurt, but I'm not scared to be around you.
well, you should be.
well, I'm not.
Ricky, I love you.
I love you.
what do you want me to do? Say I love you?
I don't love anyone. I don't even love myself.
but you said you were in love with me.
I say a lot of things, Grace.
but you're in love with me. I know you're in love with me.
aren't you in love with me?
okay, well, even if you're not in love with me,
I hope that we can at least be friends.
I'm gonna pray for that.
that we can be friends.
and, Ricky, I'm gonna pray that nobody ever hurts you again.
Bye.
call me
so your sister has a friend?
Yeah, she probably has lots of friends.
do you know who the friend is?
she gave me an address and a phone number but it's probably fake.
should we find out?
no, probably not.
I trust her.
Really?
well, not completely, but I don't think she'll get into any trouble. Ever.
not after what I did.
I kind of ruined her life too.
you didn't ruin her life.
or yours.
your life's just gonna be different.
and so is hers and so is mine and-- And your dad's, but not ruined.
don't do that to yourself.
or the baby.
life's just a big adventure.
and yours is a really big adventure right now.
but that's okay.
everything's gonna be fine.
I think it's a girl.
you do?
well, I think I want the baby to be a girl.
Why's that?
Bob abused Ricky and Ricky's a boy so
so maybe if the baby's a girl and Bob and Ricky are here then they wouldn't touch her.
Oh, honey, it doesn't work that way.
so even if the baby's a girl--?
let's just hope that whether it's a boy or a girl that no harm comes to it.
and anyway, maybe Ricky can break the cycle of abuse.
well, Ricky's father was probably abused and his father's father but...
but anyway, maybe Ricky will agree to the adoption.
maybe he'll just wanna stay away from the baby.
maybe we should both stay away.
maybe we should just let the parents be parents and do what's best for the baby.
I don't think I want to know, Mom.
not right now, anyway.
it's okay.
a lot of people don't wanna know the sex of the baby, for various reasons.
just make sure that you tell the doctor that.
and I think I want to do this alone.
Oh, okay.
whatever you feel comfortable with.
but I'm there if...
Hey, Jack.
that's Jesus.
Oh, is it?
is it a photograph?
I thought it was some painting by some Caucasian who wanted to see the son of God as light-skinned with blue eyes.
Yeah, you're right.
he kind of looks like me, don't you think?
or you look like him, depending on the ego.
you waiting to see my dad?
I am, but some crabby old woman in support stockings told me that he's stuck in traffic on the freeway.
that's the church secretary.
stuck in traffic, huh?
I needed to see him too.
you know, I can't wait around, can you?
you want a ride home?
no, I think I'll wait.
must be important.
Yes, it is.
well, if you must know,
I wanted him to stop my parents from getting divorced and now something else has become a priority.
okay, Ricky's dad got out of prison and he showed up at our house in his lime green muscle car.
I just don't want anything to happen to Amy, the baby or even Ricky.
so I just thought he might have a hotline to, you know, that guy, or know a judge or something.
a lime green muscle car?
what was he in prison for? Car theft?
I don't know but it's very important that he go back to prison.
okay, it was for abusing children, but that's all I can say.
I don't know if my dad can help you with something like that.
Yeah, I just thought I'd ask.
because, you know, I'm just
I'm just scared my dad is gonna do something stupid.
all right, some kid over in gangland is waiting for me to show up to mentor him into success, so, uh, I better get going.
good luck with that.
good luck with my dad.
you know, my ex-husband looked a lot like that.
think that's why I married him.
I thought he was that good.
turns out he's not.
you know, um, Reverend Stone isn't here. He's stuck in traffic.
that guy is always stuck in traffic. He drives like a turtle.
will you tell him that Veronica stopped by to see him?
don't know if I'll see him, but okay.
I can't wait around.
I'm a cocktail waitress over at Kevin Ryan's and we're short on help this week and I need the tips.
can't get my ex-husband to cough up the child support.
rev. Stone was supposed to help me with that.
so are you hiring?
are you looking?
well, I am looking for a job.
but I don't know if I'd be too hot at cocktails.
I mean, I'm not really a people person and I don't drink.
that's perfect. Are you over 21?
what, you wanna see my ID?
no. I'll-- I'll get you in. Come on, let's go.
goodbye.
Hey, kiddo.
Oh, right. Restraining order.
probably shouldn't be this close to a school either.
but I wanted to ask you something.
girl or boy?
the baby. Is it a girl or is it a boy?
because I got a line on a couple who would pay 100 grand for a healthy white male infant.
so I'm hoping it's a boy.
I bet you do.
look, I'm under no misconceptions here.
I know I'm not getting your vote for father of the year.
but that's all water under the bridge as far as I'm concerned.
I can't change the past.
you want me to go away, I want to go away, but I can't.
I don't have the funds.
so think of it as a finder's fee.
you give me what I want, I'll get out of your life.
it's the only way I can get out of your life.
can't get out of your life without the money.
and keep me posted on whether it's a boy or a girl.
I think Amy has her doctor's appointment today.
see you.
Adrian, I'll have to call you back.
he was there, Dad.
he was there in the parking lot at school. Ricky called me.
honey, I'll call you back.
no, talk to me. Do something.
five minutes.
I heard that.
well, then you know I'm working on it.
you're not working on it fast enough.
I'm working on it.
there has to be something you can do.
I want something done right now.
I understand that.
and I sympathize.
but sometimes we just have to let the situation play itself out.
and if someone gets hurt in the process?
we can't arrest a man for no reason.
the man abused his own son.
and he went to prison for that.
look, how frustrating do you think it is for all of us in law enforcement?
we work hard to send these guys away and then the prisons can't hold them all.
they just get turned out again and then we have to go after them again, while we also go after all the other guys out there who are yet to be caught.
but I do my job.
I'm trying to do my job anyway.
well, you better do your job as a father too, and keep that Ricky away from Adrian. She's a nice girl.
I know she's a nice girl.
and so is her mother.
we're here, okay?
Yeah.
are you Duncan's, uh...?
his...
mother.
are you?
no, I'm his sister.
I'm Shawna.
Duncan! Jack's here!
you don't look like the kind of guy who would get in trouble for fake IDs.
they told you that?
Yeah.
they also told me you probably had nothing to do with it.
Oh, I had something to do with it.
either way, um, thanks, Jack.
Duncan's not allowed to have friends in the neighborhood and he needs to get out once in a while.
it's no problem.
sorry, I was on the phone.
Hey, Jack. Hey.
you was expecting someone about this high, huh?
well, kind of, yeah.
you still wanna do this?
Yeah. Let's roll.
see you in a sec.
Hey, man. You don't wanna do that.
I don't wanna do what?
look, don't mad dog the dealer. Just drive away.
dude.
don't be stupid.
I gotta make a phone call.
no, no, no, no, no, not with me in the car.
look, you drive out the neighborhood before you make any phone calls.
better yet, mind your own business. All right?
now, let's ride.
Hey, so how'd it go?
I didn't go.
good.
she didn't let me.
good.
she doesn't want me there for the birth.
that's good too.
this isn't funny, you know?
I'm trying to be a man but it's hard when people won't let you.
lots of ways of being a man, son.
every book that I've read has said that the husband, father, partner, whatever should be there for all these things.
well, that's when the husband, father, partner, whatever is intimate with the woman who's giving birth.
as far as I know you're not intimate with Amy.
I hope.
look, she's a 15-year-old girl having a baby.
you're a 15-year-old guy.
you're not a married couple.
you haven't seen each other naked.
you haven't made love to each other.
you haven't been with each other for years.
you're just getting to know each other.
and it's just not appropriate for you to participate in certain things.
what certain things?
certain things like anything that may make your Amy feel uncomfortable.
I'll tell you what, next time you go to doctor's office for a checkup, ask Amy if she wants to go with you.
hello.
Leo. It's George Juergens.
what are you doing for dinner?
I don't know, George. What are you doing?
you feel like grabbing a steak? Have some drinks?
you got plans for dinner?
I'm just gonna wait for Amy to call.
okay, well, you can do that on your own.
you're on, George.
what the heck are you doing?
um, I'm just, uh, looking for some loose change.
all right, well, get back out there. You're doing great, kid.
Yeah, we might have a...
tiny... tad little problem.
Amy, I'm so sorry. I got tied up with a difficult delivery.
but mother and baby are just fine.
sorry to keep you waiting.
they told me I could go home but I just want to get it over with.
get it over with? This isn't an "over with" kind of visit.
this is easy.
this might be your favorite visit ever, in fact.
just so you know, um,
Amy might not wanna know what she's having.
if it's a boy or a girl.
Oh. Okay, well, come on back and we'll talk about it.
okay.
why would you get a job?
just trying to do my part.
your part in what?
I don't know, supporting the baby?
Oh, Ashley. You don't have to support the baby.
your mother's just trying to teach Amy a lesson about being responsible.
now, she's gonna be so responsible she'll probably have the baby adopted.
I know, I just don't really want that to happen.
so I was just trying to earn some extra cash, you know?
Yeah, I know. But you're underage.
you could have this business shut down.
I-- I didn't realize that.
you know, I've only been here a couple hours and I've already made a hundred in tips.
Really?
well, you can't earn money because you don't have a work permit.
so you're gonna have to pass those tips along to Veronica.
Really?
well, I don't know what to do here.
I don't want anyone to get in trouble.
here, just take it.
Oh, well, I-- I can't just...
Wow. Thank you.
you know, I should give you something in return.
how about a free dinner?
then I'd have to tell my boss and then I could lose my job...
I can't afford to lose my job right now, so...
Hey, George. Ashley.
Hey. Good to see you.
I didn't expect to see my daughter here.
she used her fake ID to get a job.
well, at least it went to good use.
how about a steak?
Oh, I called her mother to come and get her.
she should be here in a bit.
well, in the meantime, can I get you two gentlemen a drink?
joking.
what's going on?
I want to talk to you, Ricky.
okay, I know I hurt Grace's feelings and I'm sorry.
I can't help it.
you can't help a lot of things, Ricky. Sit down.
you can't help it if your father is a sick man.
you can't help it if he did horrible things to you.
you can't. It's not your fault.
you didn't ask for it. You would never ask for it.
you never wanted it to happen, Ricky.
but I imagine sometimes you doubt that.
so you keep going to therapy.
you work at it every day.
and then you realize that sometimes you're just like every other guy.
you wanna have sex because you're attracted to some woman and you love her.
then you realize that sometimes you want to have sex because your father violated you and you want to act out.
you want to abuse somebody else, anybody else, any other woman, any other girl that you can convince to have sex with you.
but you don't do that, Ricky.
because you know that if you did do that, you would just be doing to somebody else what your father did to you. Till you learn to love yourself, because you're a good person.
Ricky, deep down inside, you are a good person.
what happened to you was not your fault, but what you choose to do to other people, that's your responsibility.
son, you have it within yourself to change yourself and to stop the cycle. You can stop the cycle.
I believe that. I believe in you.
now, that's not to say that
I'm not a little nervous with you hanging around my daughter, but I believe that you can stop the cycle of violence in your family if you make the decision to do that.
what makes you think you know anything about this?
what makes you think you know anything about my life?
is this something you learned in med school?
something you read in a book?
no offense, but I don't think you know anything about it.
no offense, but I know everything about it, Ricky.
I know everything about this.
you see, my brother was a big baseball fan and our next-door neighbor somehow always had extra tickets.
well, our next-door neighbor was sexually abusing my brother and one day he killed himself.
how'd you find out about the neighbor?
on the suicide note.
that was the first time any of us knew anything about it.
you see, my brother was afraid that if we knew about it, we wouldn't love him anymore.
so that is why I am glad that you have chosen to talk to somebody.
and if you ever need to talk to anybody about this, you can talk to me.
you can talk to Grace.
no judgment ever.
I promise.
even though you know about me, you'd still let me go out with Grace?
Yeah.
I would.
you just don't do anything stupid.
so you don't know anyone who could even scare the guy a little bit?
Nope.
I just want someone to sneak up behind him in a dark alley and beat the stuffing out of him.
I don't know anyone. - No one?
Nope. And even if I did, that's not the answer.
well, come on, we have to do something.
unfortunately, George, we have to wait for the authorities to do something, you know, otherwise we're just criminals, just like he is.
we're not criminals who abuse our children.
no, we're not. We're not criminals, period.
we've got our children to think about, Ben and Amy.
I mean, the kid wants to be in the room with her when she gives birth.
Oh, no, I-- I-- I don't think so.
no, I don't either.
he's sitting around the house pouting about it.
I just hope he comes to his senses and realizes there's only so much he can do.
everything okay?
Yeah.
well, I'll be darned.
Oh, hey, hold it down a little bit, I'm getting a glare.
Yeah, that's good.
I'm Amy.
I'm your mother.
your birth mother.
and, uh, this is your grandmother, the mother of your birth mother, my mother.
she was with me when we got to see you on the sonogram.
and, uh, we love you.
I love you and
and my mother loves you.
my boyfriend and someday-husband, Ben, he loves you.
he's making this for you right now.
my dad loves you and my sister loves you and my whole family loves you.
and all my friends love you.
and that's why we wanna make sure that you have the best home possible, with the best family possible.
and, uh...
I'm gonna do whatever I have to do to make sure that happens for you.
to make sure that you get all that life has to offer.
because that's what my parents did for me.
and because...
well...
you're my son.
it's a boy
I've been calling you.
I know. I had a visitor.
did you check your messages?
no.
you didn't check your messages?
no.
they got him. Your father. He's been arrested.
for?
a possession of drugs. Jack saw him buying drugs.
he called me, I called my dad.
they got him.
if I get the job, the first paycheck I get is going straight to the attorney.
gonna take you down to Boykewich's Butchers and let you get your hands dirty.
and just so you know, I'm gonna offer a job to Ricky.
it would be good if you two could work together.
you mugged me, took the money, and then you hit me in the head with a box.
I don't believe it.
the loan went through. The house e ine.
the only person I should worry about getting on my side is you.
I want Amy to keep the baby.
do you really think I don't care about my baby?
you care enough to take care of the baby before he's born, but not enough to take care of him after that?
how much you going to pay me?
let's go grab dinner and talk.
here's what the church can offer.
a job in the daycare center.
you could teach little kids music they'd pay you for that.
and we can babysit for you.
Adrian volunteered to throw the baby shower at her house.
right. I know that you want to keep it.
I think that you could do it, but it's not gonna be easy.
I know that I can be a good mom because I have the best mom in the whole world.
Hello? - Hi, Adrian. It's Grace.
why didn't you call me???
are you expecting a call? - No.
your brother still hasn't called you?
no. - Oh.
he'll call. - Yeah, I know, he will.
he'll call.
I don't need your pity.
I'm not pitying you.
??? need any help with the shower.
no.
when is that?
Adrian, it's tomorrow.
Ugh. Yeah, okay. I'll-- I'll get some chips and dip.
I got a present already.
chips and dip? What about petit fours?
as in "I'll punch you if you make another suggestion"?
we don't need all that stuff.
okay, well, what games do you have plan?
games?
have you ever been to a baby shower?
I'm in the 10th grade.
pardon me if I'm new at this.
is that spicy?
grace, it's just a bunch of girls coming over.
okay, I'll bring the refreshments.
fine. Who's coming?
you didn't send out the invitations?
uh, you gave me invitations.
you didn't tell me who to send them to.
ay dios mio, girl. I'm coming over there.
Yeah, whatever.
you can come over here to yell at me, but you can't come over here to visit?
I told my mother that maybe I didn't get invited the shower because I hadn't been a good friend to you all this time.
so now can I come? - Of course.
me? - If you want. I guess.
you guess?
I'll call Adrian. I'm sure it was an oversight.
Really?
didn't have anything to do with what we said about Ben?
we don't think he's pretentious.
we don't care if he has a driver.
right. He-- He's a great guy.
Yeah, and we don't care that he's taken you away from us, or that you love him more than you do us.
we don't feel like you've tossed us away at all.
Madison, I didn't know you felt that way about Ben.
until now.
my point is that we don't.
I'm not the one who called her a harlot. Twice.
that was Henry, and I think he just said that because he's sexually frustrated and irritable.
all I ever said was that she bamboozled you and she doesn't even know I said that.
unless you told her.
I didn't tell her anything.
I don't know why you didn't get an invite.
maybe you should call Adrian.
Why? Adrian doesn't decide who gets invited and who doesn't.
Amy decides who gets invited, and clearly she decided not to invite me.
you want me to call Amy and get you an invitation?
no, they probably just forgot to call me.
I'll go anyway.
Oh.
Hey, by the way, are any mothers invited to the shower tomorrow?
Yeah. Amy.
no, I mean, any grandmothers? Aunts?
I hope not.
I can't believe they didn't invite me.
it's probably because of your father and Adrian's mother.
what about Grace's mom?
look, I don't know what you're thinking, but I think it's just for Amy and her friends.
okay. - Okay?
okay.
Hi, can I have the number for Dr. and Mrs. Bowman?
no. Anne.
Oh. Hi, Anne.
what a nice surprise.
and it wouldn't be a surprise if George were calling?
you're a nice surprise. He would be a bad surprise.
I'm just gonna come right out and ask you this
he only came here once, and it was to try to get Marshall and me to help him get rid of Ricky's father.
that's not what I was gonna ask, but that's interesting.
are there any mothers invited to Amy's shower tomorrow?
let me ask Grace.
grace, it's-- It's Anne, Amy's mom.
is she invited to the baby shower?
Mm-hm. - Oh. Am I invited?
is Adrian's mom coming?
Oh, yeah, is she?
she's working, but you're invited.
everyone's invited. Adrian didn't get invites out in time.
Oh. We're invited.
great.
so I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay.
thirsty?
good morning.
good morning.
for you and for me.
Oh, George, don't tell me... - It's true, Anne.
you're moving? - I am.
Oh, George, thank you, thank you, thank you.
so you're going to miss me, huh?
Oh, I will, I promise.
do you have any other boxes? Want me to help you?
I have plenty of boxes and I have a truck coming later.
today? You're moving out today?
I am.
do the girls know? - Yep.
Oh, so once again...
you're last to know.
well, I don't care.
the good news makes up for the timing.
I'll be around. - Call first.
you too.
why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know I was gonna get the keys until yesterday.
Oh, where are you going?
I'll let you know.
I don't care. The point is you're going.
Yes!
Oh. He told you.
he did.
good. So now you know.
so where's he moving? - That I don't know.
I bet it's that house that's next to Taco.
I just noticed that it went from sale to lease.
he loves that house.
he loves the idea of being able to walk across the driveway to go get a burrito any time, day or night.
if that house had been for sale when we bought this, we'd be living there now.
Uh-huh. - So anyway, need a drive to get Amy a present or did you get one?
wait, what are we talking about?
the baby shower?
Oh. That. Yeah, I wasn't invited.
Oh, you're going.
Why? - Why?
because you're Amy's sister.
you're gonna be Aunt Ashley, and don't forget, you were the one who begged her to keep the baby.
so now you get over there and support her decision to keep the baby, and you do that by writing down every gift she gets, writing down who gave it to her, and their address so she can send a thank-you note.
and please pretend to like everyone there.
okay, and that will fulfill my obligation as aunt for the child's lifetime?
that's just the beginning.
Hey.
you gonna be okay with him moving?
I know you're gonna miss him.
maybe.
you know, before he goes, you might want to ask him for some money for Amy's present.
dad, I'm eight-and-a-half months pregnant.
I'm a little irritable. Tell me what you're saying.
all right, all right. I just don't want your mother to overhear.
I was saying, if you want, you can come and live with me.
you and the baby. I mean, there's plenty of room.
I'm gonna build a nursery either way.
I think we'll be fine here.
and I think I'm gonna need help from Mom.
all right.
you need comic relief, you know where to find me.
Yeah, and Mom should know where to find you too.
I'll tell her when I want to tell her, when she needs to know.
why do we keep hiding things from Mom?
it's fun and she reacts badly to everything, and it's practice for the other things I gotta keep from her when I move out of here.
Hey.
uh, what do you want for your shower gift?
that should be pretty easy, Ashley.
I don't have anything for the baby.
I have one pair of overalls.
okay. So no overalls, then.
what about a pony? You want a pony?
I got a big yard. - I want a pony.
I wanted to get you a pony, but your mother hates ponies.
??? motorcycles, cigars, hot tubs.
all the stuff that's gonna be at the new house.
maybe we are invited.
maybe Adrian just forgot to call us too.
she forgot to call Alice. Alice is going.
maybe we're gonna get the call.
I don't think we're getting the call.
I don't think guys are invited to these things.
that's old school, man. Guys-- Guys go to baby showers.
Oh. Wait.
maybe Ricky's invited, and it would be awkward if you're invited too.
but awkward or not, if Ricky's gonna be there, you have to be there.
I don't think Ricky's invited either, but even if he is, well, it's not my baby.
it's your Amy.
what are we gonna do? Nothing?
Hey, it's me.
I can be there in a half an hour.
Oh, can you?
I'm not looking for that.
I'm looking for that.
I'm calling to see if you have anyone who should be invited to Amy's shower.
your mom, aunt, stepsister, foster sisters.
anyone you know who would come?
when is it?
this afternoon.
Yeah, well, thanks for letting my family know.
I didn't let anyone's family know.
do you know anyone or not? - Not.
Oh, come on, we're trying to get swag for your son.
I'm working, I'll buy him what he needs.
babies need a lot of stuff. A lot.
Yeah, yeah, I know. Thanks for calling.
you left your clothes in the dryer. Again.
I took them out so the rest of us can do our laundry done.
sorry. Thanks.
I was vacuuming, I didn't hear the buzzer.
you know what I heard at work yesterday?
uh, that Amy's keeping the baby.
Yeah.
I heard that at work instead of from you.
that's why I'm working.
she's keeping the baby and I'm gonna help out.
well, I guess you better start baby-proofing this room down here.
you know, it's the only area in the whole house that's not baby-proofed.
the baby's not gonna be here. The baby's gonna be with Amy.
Oh, really. Every day for the rest of his life?
he's never gonna be here?
I don't think so. No.
I don't think anyone's gonna be comfortable with me babysitting.
are you comfortable babysitting?
are you going to be comfortable being with your son?
what? I'm gonna touch my own kid?
just because I was abused, doesn't mean I would ever, ever do anything to my son.
I know that.
I just wanna make sure that you know that.
I know it, but it doesn't matter.
I think Ben's gonna be more like the father.
think again.
I doubt Ben knows how to do laundry.
I doubt Ben knows how to make a meal out of whatever is left in the refrigerator.
I doubt if Ben knows to check that the doors are locked before everybody goes to bed at night.
I doubt if Ben can even drive, or find an all-night pharmacy when someone is sick.
I doubt if Ben can even take care of anyone, even himself.
but you have been taking care of yourself for a long time.
I mean, you even help me with all these kids in and out of here.
I wish that you didn't have to take care of your son and be in high school at the same time, ???
you are.
the girls are having a baby shower for Amy today.
Oh, and I wasn't invited, of course.
well, do you wanna go?
Nah, I don't think so.
but you know what?
I'm gonna buy you something.
you're the father.
you're gonna be needing things too.
is it over yet?
you just gotta get into it.
Yeah, Adrian, it's gonna be a great party.
Hey, I hope you don't mind, I invited Shawna.
What'd she say? She say yes?
I had to talk her into it.
and how'd you do that, Jack?
how'd you talk her into it?
it doesn't matter. We're happy to have her.
how'd you make out with the phone list?
I haven't called anyone except for Ricky.
you didn't call anyone after I left last night?
I'll call them. Jeez.
I'm excited to meet Shawna.
what time you dropping her off?
dropping her off?
no guys are coming. It's a baby shower.
so? - So it's for girls. Only.
I wish I would have know that before I rented a helium tank and blew up these balloons for you.
Oh, come on, we're friends.
you don't mind blowing up a few balloons for me, do you?
you're not flirting with me, are you?
do you want me to be flirting with you?
depends on whether or not you're still in love with Ricky.
Ricky is about to become a father.
I think we have to settle for just being friends.
sometimes when you're friends with the person it lasts longer than when you're in a relationship with them.
I don't now, or never wanted to be just friends with you.
so how serious are you about Shawna?
I'm serious about her. Yeah.
grace, Shawna and I
none of my business.
if it's just a girls' party,
I don't think I'll come with Shawna after all.
okay.
well, uh, if you don't need anything else...
no. I think we've got everything we need.
all right, look.
I know I shouldn't ask, but I'm gonna anyway:
did you really need balloons or did you just want to see me?
no, we-- We really needed balloons.
balloons are fun.
and I-- I wanted to see you.
Hi, this is Adrian from school.
the majorette?
Yeah, that one.
I'm giving Amy a baby shower today, do you want to come?
she's the pregnant girl in the band.
Yeah, all right, whatever.
Hey, this is Adrian.
I need you to do me a favor.
I need you to come to Amy's baby shower today.
so? I've slept with other girls' boyfriends, so what?
Hi, it's Adrian.
look, I'm having a party this afternoon, you want to come?
no, it's not that kind of party.
I need some help with the phone calls.
hey-- Did you say something?
Yeah, I said
why do you look like that?
like what?
I know that look.
what look?
the flushed-in-the-face, messed-up hair look.
Oh, no, that's, um
that's just because we were blowing up balloons.
where are the balloons?
I thought we tied them
we meant-- We meant to tie them.
well, you must have had your hands full with something else.
Yeah, they must have blown away.
I can't believe it. - What a shame.
after Jack came over to help us and everything,
he worked so hard on that.
Yeah.
okay, you're gonna have to call some people.
people don't like me. No one's coming.
okay. Give me the phone list.
Hey, Marilyn?
Hey, it's Grace Bowman. How are you?
how's the new puppy?
Oh, I can't wait to see him. I bet he's so cute.
you have to bring him over.
you know, my brother loves dogs, and we were thinking a sasquatch is the perfect breed for him.
Hey, listen, I know this is totally last-minute, and it's kind of a spontaneous event, but Adrian and I are throwing a baby shower for Amy
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Aw, okay. Thank you.
and I can't wait to see the puppy. Bye.
she has an orthodontist appointment.
but I am sure there are plenty of girls who don't have orthodontist appointments who would love to come.
so I'll make the calls, I'll get girls over here.
it's gonna be a beautiful afternoon.
he'll call.
your brother?
he'll call.
I don't care about him.
it was a stupid idea to go out with him in the first place, and I hate all that romance stuff.
I mean, the flowers and the teddy bears and everything?
he's cheating.
Jack doesn't want me to go to the baby shower.
he's totally cheating on me.
let's not mix business with pleasure.
he's not cheating on me,
I don't want to know about cheating on you.
Yes, you do.
I'm your sister.
and you don't like guys who cheat on me.
Aw, Shawna. They always end up cheating on you.
that's just guys. Guys cheat.
and what do we do???
no. Nope. You're not going there again.
I am going to kick that 16-year-old Romeo to the curb and run over him.
you have no proof.
I know when a guy's cheating on me.
just like you know when a guy's in love with you?
Yes, I'm free tonight. You wanna go out?
I need your help. - Anytime.
I need guests for Amy's shower.
it's today at 3 at Adrian's. Girls only.
I'm on it.
Hi, we haven't been formally introduced yet.
I'm Joe Hampton and I can tell you anything you want to know about anyone here at Grant High School in exchange for a very small favor.
I can't tell her. You tell her. She can tell me no.
no, she can't, Ash.
and she's gonna get upset, and then she's gonna be fine with it, just like she was when I toldr I want She told you she wanted a divorce.
you didn't tell her you wanted one.
Yeah, that was the story when I was in the garage.
now that we're moving, I asked for the divorce.
the man has to take the blame.
because? - Because that's what a man does.
he accepts that everything is his fault. I accept that.
but it's not your fault.
what about Adrian's mom?
Yeah. So it is your fault.
that's what I'm saying.
I love you, Ash, and we're all gonna be fine.
everything's gonna be fine.
just tell her.
early. I hate early.
I couldn't call you. Ruben talked to my dad.
they took my cell phone.
he knows you've called a hundred times, ?? he said if I didn't break this off, he and my dad would send me to military school this summer.
he really, really doesn't want me to see you.
so you're here because...?
obviously, I don't want to go to military school,
I'd have to cut my hair, but...
I miss you.
I like what you've done with the place.
I'm giving Amy a baby shower.
the pregnant girl.
Yeah, I know. Your boyfriend's one-night stand.
he's not my boyfriend.
should I open that?
I don't know.
the timing doesn't seem right. I think I'll just
we only have a half-hour.
I'll come back. - No, no.
this'll be fun.
I don't know, Adrian.
I'd like to have more than a half an hour.
I mean, after all, this is your first time.
didn't you reclaim your virginity?
Oh, no. I never really made that commitment.
we can wait till later.
you risked military school to come over here.
I am not gonna let you go off to war without something to remember me by.
Hey, Jack, come on in.
Hey, bro. What up, dog?
you don't have to do that, man.
in fact, don't do that.
question:
you're not cheating on my sister, are you?
what? No, why would you think I'm cheating on Shawna?
no, I wa??? No. Shawna's thinking that.
Why?
that girl has a nose for cheating.
she got it through experience.
she could start her own business: Cheaters, Incorporated.
she's a cheat savant.
all right, well, I'm not cheating on her.
I'm a liar savant.
and you, my mentor and friend, are lying.
I am not.
and where's Shawna? We need to talk.
she's on her way to the baby shower to meet the slut.
which one?
the one that you've been with.
she went to the shower alone? Why would she do that?
she doesn't know anybody.
weren't you listening?
said she's going to meet the slut.
she doesn't need you for that.
I't cheating, and she's not going there to, you know, cause a scene or something, is she?
no, Shawna's got class.
the scene is gonna be when she finds you.
this-- This isn't one of your pranks, is it?
Uh-uh.
now, tell me the truth, are you cheating on my sister?
no.
you thinking about cheating on my sister?
I'm sorry you guys can't go to the shower.
Yeah, me too.
if you see Ashley, tell her I said hello.
I think I'll be seeing Ashley.
but she's been seeing someone, you know.
still.
I could love that girl.
but don't tell her that, just-- Just tell her I said hello.
I'll tell her.
I love you.
Oh, so we'll, uh, drop you off and then we'll pick you up after the shower's over.
and, uh, then I have a little gift for you.
no, Ben.
Ben, you are a gift.
I can't believe how you've stayed with me through this whole thing.
you're so sweet.
uh, we'd better get going, Amy.
did you hear something?
no. - What's with you two?
I'm sorry, Mr. Boykewich.
I'm just so happy today.
Yeah, me too.
uh, I'm gonna go to the restroom downstairs.
Oh. He's kicking.
a lot.
how much longer?
three weeks. - Can't wait.
I can.
Bye.
you know, sexual activity can induce labor.
so be careful. That's all I'm saying.
she's got three weeks.
that counts as sexual activity?
Henry, you have a father, right?
discuss that stuff with him.
Oh, I don't think he knows anything about this stuff.
what, you think a stork dropped you off?
I got the ice!
your manager let me use the machine by the pool.
he's so nice.
and so are your neighbors, the Ortiz family.
Mrs. Ortiz said she's gonna drop by and bring a little something, some homemade salsa.
she makes her own salsa and she makes her own chips.
I had to invite her.
you have to hide. - Where?
there. Just stay there, and lock the door when I get out.
I'll be right there, Grace!
Oh. - Yeah.
Oh.
Hi. - Hi.
are you...? - Max.
you must be Grace.
I am so happy you finally called her.
Yeah, I am too.
or you were about to be.
did I just hear someone at the door?
do you want me to get it?
Yeah, if you don't mind.
I think maybe I should get dressed.
well, it was so nice to finally meet you.
he is cute.
no, no, no, no, no. Don't leave.
this shower will be over in a half-hour.
I have to or Ruben's gonna get suspicious.
said I was going to the car wash.
no, please, don't leave.
are you the slut that had oral sex with Jack and broke him up with his girlfriend?
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.
um, this is the slut's condo, but I'just answering the door.
but she's not really a slut.
she just has that reputation.
Adrian's really such a nice girl.
you're gonna love her.
Adrian, Shawna's here. Jack's new girlfriend.
Oh, excuse me one second.
so you must be the girlfriend.
the ex-girlfriend. - Yeah.
Hi, Alice! Come on in.
meet Shawna, Jack's new girlfriend.
another one? Is everyone here one of Jack's girlfriends?
Hi. Alice.
Hi, Alice. Shawna.
I don't think Jack's ever mentioned you.
he's never mentioned you either.
but Jack, like me, uses discretion in his relationships.
we don't broadcast our every move over the Internet.
you don't have to.
I know when a man is cheating on me, and I know who he's cheating with.
and it's not you.
would either of you two like some quiche?
quiche? There's quiche?
Yeah, hi, come on in.
if we had gotten our invitation in advance, we would have volunteered to make full-size quiches.
?? The little ones are finger food.
uh, you two already know Alice. But this is Shawna, Jack's girlfriend.
come in, come in, sit down, make yourselves at home.
I'll take that for you. - Oh, thank you.
Hi. I'm Grace Bowman.
Oh, the Christian girl.
Hi.
Where's Adrian? I wanna meet Adrian.
and Amy. And Ben. And Ricky. Are the guys coming?
no, it's just us girls.
Oh.
I'm sorry, and you are?
Oh, yeah, right. I forgot.
I'm Marc's wife, Virginia.
Marc's wife?
marc Molina. - Mr. Molina's wife?
Yeah.
what do you have to eat?
Oh, come in, sit down.
I'll get you a little bit of everything. - Okay.
I didn't know Mr. Molina was expecting.
that's my mother.
she had a little accident in the parking lot.
thank heavens she dropped me off in front.
and you shouldn't know that Mr. Molina's expecting, because counselors should not discuss personal business with students.
and students shouldn't invite counselors' wives to baby showers.
Oh, that was probably Adrian.
no, someone named Joe.
Oh. Joe.
well, I'm so happy you came. Come in.
I want to hit that lady.
it's okay, Tammy. It was upsetting, but it's just a car.
thankfully, no one got hurt.
I can't believe she did that.
you know, maybe Adrian knows who it is.
we should get her license number.
no, I think we better leave well enough alone.
she looked nuts. I don't like to criticize, but something was wrong with that woman.
I don't want her to know who I am.
are you okay? - No.
I told her I didn't want to come to this shower.
Yeah. Me neither.
I have a really bad feeling about this.
what up, Guys?
please.
didn't I tell you I'm not a drop-in kind of guy?
I don't know what type of meeting this is, but I'm gonna go wait in the truck.
what are you talking about?
goodbye.
what's in the pillowcase?
nothing.
come on. What's in there?
what do you want?
I wanna know what's in there. - I don't.
it's none of your business. It's my house. It's my room.
it's my pillowcase. - Goodbye.
Hey, if you tell anyone...
I won't. I-- - I will.
I'm practicing diapering. I've done it before, but it's been a while since there was a baby here.
I've never done it. Let me try it. Here.
you open the gift. Duncan, you time me.
okay.
am I in a basement with two guys playing with dolls?
get this over there. Ah!
shoot.
Hello, little mama. Is the party for you?
Yeah, I'm Amy. You have to help me.
I think the baby is coming.
can you get my mom, please?
hurry.
Hola, Mrs. Ortiz.
everyone, this is Mrs. Ortiz.
is there a Mrs. Amy's mother?
that's me.
everything's fine. You come with me.
I have a surprise.
everyone, the surprise is homemade chips and salsa.
doesn't that sound like fun?
Amy, are you okay?
I think this is it, Mom.
I'm having the baby.
Oh, I don't know, Amy. You still got a few weeks left.
and there's a lot of false labor pains towards the end.
well, false or not, now we have an excuse to leave.
mom, are you gonna take me to the hospital?
Ashley, call your father. Have him meet us there.
come on. Come on.
did you tell her? - I didn't get a chance.
I think Amy's in labor.
just meet us at the hospital.
are you sure? I'm paying these guys by the hour.
dad. - No kidding?
you're on the way to the hospital?
Yeah.
okay, I'm gonna go in the next room, and I'm gonna turn the music on, and then you'll dance your way in, and I'll tell them that you're the stripper for the party.
okay, one, I don't think they have strippers at baby showers, and two, I'm not that good of a dancer, and three, I want your friends to like me.
walk around with your shirt off and they'll like you.
what is going on?
I was having a baby shower for Amy, but
where is everyone?
well, I hope it was worth it.
I hope one afternoon was worth eight weeks of boot camp, getting up at 4 a. m. running till you vomit, and shaving your head.
it was.
I think I'm in love, to tell you the truth.
in love? - Yeah, Adrian.
I'm falling in love with you.
and I want him to know that.
Really?
I'm not comfortable with him knowing that.
why do you keep complicating my life?
I don't know. I don't mean to.
Yeah, you do. I think you do.
I don't hear you saying you're falling in love with him.
did you ever think I was looking after your best interest when I discouraged you from going out with Adrian?
what do you mean by that?
it means you've got a lot of growing up to do.
you're not ready to fall in love.
you don't really know what love is.
could that be because my daddy wasn't around when I was growing up?
or could that be because you don't know what love really is?
tell him, or better yet, tell your wife.
he's been seeing my mom.
all those out-of-town seminars, those are a lie.
you can thank me later for getting you out of boot camp.
you know, they take girls too.
I really didn't wanna know.
and did you wanna tell me you love me too, before I go?
I didn't think so.
you know, I think if I had tried a couple more times,
I could've beat him.
I don't-- I don't get the time-trial aspect.
I don't know why you have to hurry up and put the diaper on.
I think the thing is cleanliness, comfort and safety.
I mean, not that I wanna be talking about this kind of stuff while I'm eating or before I'm 30.
so you think I'm cheating on you?
Yeah.
with Grace.
we kissed. That's it.
you see, I went over there to help out with the baby shower.
she wanted me to bring over one of those helium tanks to blow up balloons.
I didn't see any balloons.
we were outside and we weren't paying attention.
they kind of floated away.
but there were balloons. I'm not lying about that.
what are you lying about?
nothing, really.
I like you and I like being with you.
I just-- I don't really get the feeling you wanna be with me for a lifetime.
I thought I did.
and then? - I met your friends.
what's wrong with my friends?
they're all...
teenagers, and I'm not a teenager, and you should be able to be a teenager, and I don't wanna take that from you, and I don't wanna be a teenager again myself.
Really? - Really.
I like being 20 and I'm about to be 21.
and if there's five years difference between us,
I could actually get arrested for sleeping with you.
Yeah, but I wanted to sleep with you, so...
you said "wanted." Past tense.
did I?
you did.
this where you tell me we can be friends?
because I don't get that.
okay.
then I will just be Duncan's sister, and you can still be Duncan's mentor.
please. Because he really likes you.
and so do I.
I really like you too, Shawna.
so I guess I'll, uh...
I'll see you around?
okay. - All right.
all right, I'll see you next Monday?
okay. - All right.
Oh, my big sister's growing up.
seriously, you did a great job.
it's hard to be a hostess at someone else's house.
it wasn't too bad, was it?
no.
I can always say the first time I threw a baby shower, the baby came the same day.
exactly.
how did it go? - It was nice.
Tammy called me and she said it was terrible.
Oh, it was a lovely shower.
and Tom, guess what?
Amy's on her way to the hospital to have the baby.
Ouch.
I mean, oh, the miracle of life.
Hey, Mom, um, there's something I wanted to tell you.
you sound serious.
I hope this isn't about those birth control pills.
Oh, I hope they get a room ready soon.
it's okay.
why don't you and Ashley go take a walk?
Oh, I don't-- I don't know, Mom.
I think I'd rather wait for the pain medication and then take a walk.
well, Amy, after you take the pain medication, you won't be able to walk.
Oh. Yeah. I forgot.
good thing we scheduled that marathon birthing seminar for next weekend.
good plan.
Ashley, can you...?
Thanks.
are you okay?
no.
what if that big baby can't get through that little girl of ours?
she'll be okay.
the doctor said she'll be okay.
how does the doctor know she'll be okay?
because she's a doctor.
I can't believe that Amy's having a baby.
I still don't want to believe it.
Yeah, me neither. But it's true.
what are you and Ashley not telling me?
some other time. This isn't the right time.
I wanna know.
you'll just get upset.
my 15-year-old daughter is having a baby, and I'm not that upset.
I think I'm doing okay, don't you?
Yeah, you are doing okay.
you're a strong woman, Anne.
a lot stronger than I ever realized.
thank you.
Ashley's moving in with me.
are you scared?
Yeah.
but I can't wait.
I can't wait to see him.
Yeah, me too.
you're gonna help me with him, aren't you, Ashley?
of course I am.
you're not just moving in with Dad so I can have your room for a nursery?
you're gonna use my room as a nursery?
I'm kidding.
lot of changes this year.
Yeah.
Ashley,I want you to be in the room with me when he comes.
um, Amy, there are things you can't really un-see.
you're kidding again, right?
right.
I don't mind staying with you as long as I don't have to see anything.
I feel the same way.
Hi, Amy.
we were waiting for you.
thank you.
you can't be in the room.
I will be wherever you want me to be.
did you call Ricky?
no, uh, someone will probably call him.
Adrian's probably already called him. Or Grace.
shouldn't you call him?
let's try to do the right thing, you and me, for the baby.
Hi, Ricky. It's me, Amy.
I just wanted to tell you that I'm at the hospital.
I didn't know if someone had called you.
no. Why are you at the hospital? Is everything okay?
everything's fine.
the baby's coming.
Oh, my God. Now? - Yeah.
I thought maybe you'd wanna be here.
you did?
I mean, I didn't know if you wanted me to be there or not.
we never really talked about it.
well, I think you should be here.
he's your son.
please let me come back to the apartment.
I don't want to be with someone who can't trust me.
it's me.
remember that kid who lived with us for a while?
the one that everybody is looking for?
one for the road?
Amy is no longer at the apartment.
if I could get you a really, really hot date, would you go out then?
who would I fix her up with? - That guy upstairs.
no. No. No, no, no. He's a player.
but you didn't say anything. And I broke up with Jack.
that has nothing to do with me and Jesse.
Yes, it does. I would have just hung in there for a couple more weeks.
you can't send naked pictures of my daughter around to half the school and not go to jail for it.
it's child pornography.
Betty and I are splitting up.
you ever pick up my phone, check my messages, my emails, my texts?
did you tell Mom that Nora is living here or am I just supposed to be hiding that?
if you're trying to get back with your old boyfriend, - what are you doing here with me? - I thought it would make him jealous.
let me be crazy for you, don't go to Adrian.
you need a little more practice at being crazy.
I hate that I do this to myself.
I mean, just last week, all I wanted was for him to let me and John come back to the apartment.
and now that I have that, I want more.
I always want more or better or different than what I have.
well, welcome to the human race.
no, I'm sure that some girls would be thrilled to be living with the father of their baby, especially if the father was anything like Ricky, and so caring, and so helpful and...
hot.
he's so hot!
he is! He's really hot!
some nights I just look at him and I can't believe he's looking back at me the same way.
I know.
I mean, you were that nerdy French horn player who thought she'd ever have boyfriend, and then you end up...
I'm sorry. Uh, where were you?
um, I was at...
okay, I know that 'm a lucky girl to have Ricky in my life, but I want to be married.
I want to know that Ricky is going to be there for me and for John for the rest of our lives.
well, getting married is not going to guarantee that or anything else.
I know that, but it's what I want.
I feel terrible that I feel this way.
I wish I didn't, and I try not to, but honestly, Madison, it doesn't make me feel too good about myself, after getting pregnant at 15, to be living with Ricky at 17.
I'm not even sure it's better than living with my parents.
not that my parents are even living together.
once upon a time, there was a little boy who wasn't much older than you, and he lived with a wicked king who had a bad temper and yelled and hit things.
and the queen couldn't stop him and she was afraid of him.
so she did things to make herself unconscious.
bad things.
like she did drugs and she drank too much.
so, one day, some people came and took the little boy away, and he went to live at another house, and then another house and then another house.
finally, a good king and queen rescued the little boy and took him in.
unfortunately, by this time, he was a little rotten himself, and he had to learn how not to be like the wicked king and queen when he grew up.
and when he was 16 years old, he met a girl at band camp and he had a baby with her.
but he didn't marry her, and she wanted to get married so badly she was driving him crazy.
so, finally, he decided he wanted to give her what she wanted because he loved her so much.
so, he went shopping for a diamond ring.
not a big diamond ring, a tiny diamond ring, the kind of diamond ring you can buy if you save your money working at a butcher shop.
a ring like this.
do you like it?
do you like it, John? - Yes.
I hope Amy likes it.
you know who Amy is?
who is Amy? - Mommy.
do you want me to give Mommy the ring? - No.
why not?
okay, well, I'm not going to give it to her yet.
I'm going to wait and give it to her the night I graduate from high school.
all right, well, I'm going to go.
and I needed to vent.
but I've vented and now i'm going to go find a way to get Ricky to ask me to marry him.
how are you going to do that? - Okay.
well, here's what I'm thinking.
and then, while he's having his shake,
I'll run a hot bath, light some candles and then call him in to take a bath with me.
he thinks I can be wild. I can be wild.
Yeah, it's romantic!
Goodnight, Madison.
I'm sorry, it's just...
you know, if he won't marry you after all the things through together, then he's not marry you because you give him a chocolate shake and a bath.
shut up. You don't know.
maybe I'll even wash his hair. - Oh!
okay. We should stop.
Yeah, I guess we should.
it's just so nice to be with you again.
it's nice to be with you, too.
but we both know you're going away to school, so, like you once pointed out to me, we shouldn't do anything because chances are we won't end up together.
well, as long as we both realize that...
then what? We should just do it?
no. I can't.
I just want to wait and see how things go.
all right, we can wait.
but I really did miss you, and you know how much I care about you.
but I'm still not doing it.
what if I decide to go to the same school that Jack is going to?
I haven't decided where I'm going to school yet, but according to my counselor, I should have lots of options.
and I can't limit my options to schools that are geographically convenient to whatever school you go to.
but I think you're missing what I'm offering you here.
I might be willing to change schools for you.
no, I know what you're offering, and I don't want that responsibility.
if you change schools for me, then what happens if I change my mind about us, or if you change your mind about us?
which you have before.
so maybe we should just live for today.
or tonight, anyway. - No.
you're really good at saying "no."
I've had a lot of practice.
don't you want your first time to be with me?
Yeah. I do, but that's what I want right now, tonight, but in a year, or the year after that
I don't know what I'll want then, and neither do you.
so, let's just wait.
would it feel right if I said I love you?
are you saying you love me, or are you asking if it would feel right to have sex if you said you love me?
I love you, Lauren.
Oh my God, really? - Really.
do you love me?
Yeah.
Hey! Stop! Okay?
but I love you.
you know what?
that was an "I want in your pants I love you."
that was not a real "I love you."
so I take mine back. Goodnight.
Oh, man.
I so screwed up.
Jack? - Yeah, it's me, Madison.
look, here's the deal.
you were right. I am in love with Grace,
I am totally obsessed with her.
but I can't have Grace because Grace is with her current boyfriend, Daniel.
and as you know, graduation is coming up and I don't want it to be like the senior dance.
I don't want to ask Grace to go and have her drag Daniel along again.
so I'd like you to go with me.
and I hope you don't think I'm being a jerk because I'm being totally honest with you.
and since you and I were girlfriend and boyfriend for years, you think you could possibly go with me, for old times' sake? As a friend?
Yeah. - You would?
Really? Why?
because Lauren is gonna be there with Jesse, and Amy's gonna be there with Ricky and I want to go, too, even if it's just with you.
and Grace isn't gonna be there because she's not a senior, so what do I care?
Thanks, Madison. As Coach would say, you're a team player.
that's so romantic.
Madison... - I know.
we're just going as friends.
your phone is buzzing.
it's Adrian.
I know what this is about. I've been avoiding her all week.
that idiot never called her. - What idiot?
that idiot you fixed her up with from upstairs.
and hey, I didn't fix her up.
you fixed her up.
I didn't want anything to do with it.
he said he would call her. Can't you just get him to call her?
no. I can't get him to call her.
if he doesn't call her, he doesn't call her.
fine. Give me his number and I'll get him to call her.
he should be ashamed of himself.
wait. Did they do something?
he took her upstairs to get a better look at the canvas.
what do you think?
that doesn't mean that they did anything.
you're so naive!
she's so obsessed with having him calling her
I'm sure he took advantage of her and now he won't even give her the courtesy of a phone call.
did you say took advantage or took her up on her offer?
whatever they did and whatever they do is their business.
it's not our business.
gotta go.
can you talk to him?
Hi, Adrian. - Grace.
I've been calling you all night because he still hasn't called me.
did you ask Daniel if he knows why Dante didn't call me or not?
he hasn't seen him.
can't he go and see him? He lives upstairs.
do you really want Daniel to ask him?
I mean, doesn't that sound sort of, you know, high school?
this guy's in college. I think you should play hard to get.
well, it's a little too late for that.
you slept with him on the first date?
you slept with Daniel before you even went on a date with him.
and no, I didn't. We just fooled around a little.
then why did you bring up the fact that I slept with Daniel before I ever went out with him?
I don't know. I just felt like it 'cause I'm very upset about this.
grace, guys don't not call me.
okay? This has never happened before.
and this isn't good for my ego. - He's probably just busy.
with what? Finals are over.
I don't know, Adrian.
it's bad enough that I can't graduate with my class in two weeks because I lost my baby and I was too depressed to go to school.
I don't need this.
I'm so sorry, Adrian.
does he know what you've been through?
does he know that I lost a baby?
no. Not exactly. I......
let him think that I thought I was pregnant but I wasn't.
and okay, it's a little weird that I got married in high school and I'm getting a divorce before graduation, but hey, - that's no reason not to call me again. - I know, Adrian, but...
but nothing.
I need this guy. - Okay, well, if this guy doesn't work out, then we'll get you another guy.
there are lots of guys around. - I like that one.
thanks again for the chocolate shake, Amy. - You're welcome.
someone is looking for a proposal.
you want to join me?
join you in the bath?
it'll be fun. I could wash your hair.
Oh, my God.
she is desperate.
this could be fun.
be right there.
till death do us part.
did you say something? - No.
and then we're seniors! We're gonna be seniors in high school.
and a year from now, we'll be looking at going off to college.
Yeah. So where are we going?
well... - Wherever I can get into.
which is probably not where you two can get into, unless I miraculously ace the next SAT.
Yeah, it's too bad about that, huh? - I choke on standardized tests.
I don't know what it is.
I start trying to figure out how many questions and how much time and I divide the time by the questions, and by then I've lost time and then I divide again, and then I get panicked.
Aw, I feel so badly for you.
you have to get over that. You should take another SAT course.
I've run out of them.
I did the one at school, the one at the community college, the one my dad paid a fortune for at that private high school.
and I saw a shrink that deals with test anxiety.
I don't think there's anything else I can do.
don't worry about it. We'll go where you go.
uh, I think we have to go to whatever the best school is that we can get into.
or I have to, anyways.
Henry's just going to have to conquer the SATs.
Hi, guys. What's going on?
Hi, Mr. Boykewich. - Hello.
what you got there? - Oh, I just thought
I'd bring up some mini pizzas for you guys.
I'm doing a little test of a sausage we just sold to a nationwide pizza company.
want a taste?
sure. - Sure.
you're young people.
I want your opinion about this stuff.
you probably eat more pizza than anyone, right?
what do you think? - I think I've never had you come up and ask my friends to test out any products before.
I had some time to kill. - Well.
they're great.
Yeah. But I'd go a little thinner on the crust.
I have nothing to do with the pizza part, just the sausage.
but I'll tell them what you said.
Oh, no, don't do that.
want another one? - We've kind of been eating junk food all night.
okay, well.
staying over? - No, we're going over to Alice's.
want me to have Mike drive you home?
they're not ready to leave yet, Dad.
and I have my car. But thanks, Mr. Boykewich.
sure. All right. Well.
good night.
he's a little lonely since Betty left.
you have to find him someone new.
I need to find me someone new.
Oh, you'll find someone, but it's kind of soon. You're still married.
and next time you meet a girl,
I think you should rely on our opinion a little more.
you know, like your dad. And Henry and I understand what it takes to make a good relationship. Don't we, Hank?
you guys wanna take home the rest of those pizzas?
no, thank you, but maybe we should be going.
Oh, don't let me rush you. - Oh, no, of course not.
we have to get home anyway.
good night. - Night.
what the heck is going on?
what do you mean? - Did you want them to go for some reason?
no, not really.
is there something going on? - Not that I know of, no.
something going on with you?
this is about Camille, isn't it? - Yeah.
here's the thing.
when do you think it would be too soon to give her a call?
it's never too soon. You're a free man, you're just waiting on papers, so call her.
should I call her? Should I just show up?
should I send her flowers first?
or maybe a nice piece of jewelry or something?
jewelry? Dad, what are you, Maurice Chevalier?
just just call her, or email her or text her and tell her that you and Betty have gone your separate ways and you just want to say hello.
well, I want to do more than say hello.
well, you can do more than just say hello and not buy her jewelry.
she likes jewelry. And I want her to like me.
like you? Dad, apparently she was waiting for you all those years.
I think she more than likes you.
look, I went over there last time with nothing more in my hand than a job offer and I got my ass kicked.
I don't want to go over there without something this time.
okay, well, just don't show up there, she might be dating someone by now.
there's no one she'd like as much as you, but you have to contact her first and find out if she wants you to come over there, so send her flowers and ask her to call you.
that's not how a gentleman behaves, asking a woman to call him.
you think she would?
I think she would.
she's gonna drive all the way back to Palm Springs tonight?
she's gonna have to. I don't wanna tell her you're here.
you're going to let Anne drive herself and the baby all the way back to Palm Springs tonight?
she does it all the time.
and you don't think it would be a better idea to tell her that I'm living here, to give her the option of staying here tonight, in her own house?
no, this is way more fun. It's our little secret.
okay, George, what if something happens on the road?
then it's gonna be my fault. - No, it's gonna be her fault for working so late.
I can't tell if you're joking or if you just have no idea what civilized people do.
even I know that that's not something someone should do.
and I'm an alcoholic, drug addict, ex-con.
look, this is my house until the girls graduate from high school, and then Anne can do whatever she wants with the house, she can rent it to me, she can sell to me, she can live in it herself, but tonight, it's mine and I don't want to tell her that you're living here and I don't want her staying here.
I can't stay in her place, so she can't stay in my house.
that's what it is. I see.
okay. Well, I better get out of here and hide in Ashley's room before she gets here.
she said it would be another hour.
well, it wasn't. Hi.
Hi. I'm George's ex-wife.
I just came to get our son. so I'll go get him and get out of your way.
he just ate, so he'll probably just sleep in the car.
should be a pleasant drive for you.
Hi. I'm Ricky's mom.
I'm Nora. I am gay and I am living here as a temporary solution.
Ricky's mom. Hi. Anne.
Anne, it's so nice to meet you.
were you jealous? Just for a second there? Either of you?
no. - No.
here. I packed his stuff already. Good night.
okay. I think I'll just go to my room now.
okay. You guys figure out who's sleeping where, and, you know, if you need Ashley's bed, I can sleep on the couch.
so she's living here?
is she paying you money to live here?
no, she just needs a place.
she's been living with Ricky's other mother.
I know that. Did she get kicked out for some reason?
no, she did not get kicked out.
you know she's not gonna have sex with you.
I know that. I know what a lesbian is.
right. So you know that if she brings a date home, the two of them are not going to have sex with you.
they might.
all right, well, if you wanna stay, the other half of the bed is open.
sorry, Moose.
no, I don't want to stay, but I don't want to drive back to Palm Springs, either.
I'm sick of driving here and back. I'm exhausted.
well, Amy's room is available.
good. Then you can sleep in Amy's bed and I can sleep in my bed in my house, like I would have hoped you would have offered.
you don't let me stay at your condo.
you are such a child!
Oops.
just coming back in. I left my cell phone.
and I couldn't agree more.
I'm sorry. I'm sure you had a long day and didn't feel like being surprised.
believe me, you're not the problem.
and I've always wanted to meet you, especially now that Amy is living with Ricky.
Yeah, and pushing him to marry her. - Oh, no.
is that what Ricky is saying? That she's pushing him?
well, yeah, but I don't think he minds.
you know what I've been thinking, Amy?
no. What?
that we really should get married.
Really?
Yeah. When we both graduate from college, and we have jobs and we're more settled, we should get married.
um, yeah.
Yeah, that sounds good.
I mean, good and kind of vague.
could you be more vague?
that wasn't vague. That was very specific.
that would be five years from now.
we should make a five-year plan and stick to it.
five years will go by like that.
especially if every night is like tonight.
my neck is a little stiff from holding my head back when you were shampooing my hair.
would you mind giving me a massage?
even if I did get into a school that you're aiming for, my parents wouldn't have the money for me to go.
there are five kids in my family.
I'd have to get a scholarship, and I don't think there's any chance of that.
let's not worry about things that haven't happened.
it's just that...
I'm starting to feel a little guilty about the sex.
what?
I mean, we both see the possibility of this not lasting, yet we keep having sex.
really good sex.
well, now that you've said that, it's not going to be good sex.
and I can't see the possibility of us not lasting, or I couldn't until you started talking like this.
you're not sabotaging the SATs just to not get into a good college, are you?
are you trying to get away from me?
we've been together since the third grade.
And? - And if we take a break after next year and go to different colleges, then, I don't know, that might be good for us.
I may even want to travel for a year or two before I go to college.
Henry, you are not breaking up with me at school, are you?
I said take a break, not break up.
take a break, and not for another year.
you coward!
you don't want to be with me, so you're going to wait until we get into different colleges and then use that as an excuse?
just forget I said anything.
sorry, couldn't find parking.
Where's Alice going?
I think I'm gonna throw up. - What's wrong?
Alice thinks I broke up with her.
Why?
did you? - No???
if we break up, it'll be next year, after we both graduate and go our separate ways.
but just last night, we were talking about all going to college together if you can do a little better on the SATs.
Oh, no. You don't want to take the SATs again, do you?
I just can't. I can't do it!
you don't understand the pressure of being Filipino.
your family places a lot of importance on the SATs?
and on grades. And on college. And on marrying someone they approve of.
they don't approve of Alice?
no, they do.
they'd like to see us get married.
and "like to see us" means you're expected to, and Ben...
she's the only girl I've ever even kissed.
Oh, Henry.
when I graduate, I wanna see the world.
I wanna go places, experience new things with new women.
what made you start thinking this way?
I think it was either when you got pregnant or married or filed for divorce.
he called last night and I'm going to graduation with him and everything graduation-related.
you know, I agreed to go as his date, as a friend who knows that he doesn't love me. He loves Grace.
Why? Why would you do that?
well, because I thought Lauren was going with Jesse, and you'd be there with Ricky and we'd all have a good time.
it's just an agreement. I mean, we both agreed.
you have absolutely zero self-esteem, you know that?
well, look where your self-esteem got you!
Madison! - And you!
I don't see a ring on your finger.
chocolate shake and a bath didn't work out? Huh?
what? - I'm trying to get Ricky to marry me.
and, by the way, he did say he would marry me.
when?
when we get out of college and we get a job and we get settled.
then he asked me to massage his neck.
and you did, didn't you?
Yes. I did. It made him happy.
what is he gonna do to make you happy?
I am happy. That's why I wanna get married.
Amy, you're in high school.
and I'm living with him and our son.
excuse me, Lauren?
could we talk?
can we talk? - You sure you don't want to do more than talk?
I apologize. It's not like me to be so pushy, but it's not like you to go past first base, so I thought I could, you know, go for a home run.
I misread the signals.
that's ridiculous.
I know. I know it is, and I know I got too pushy and I blew it.
but please, Lauren, it won't happen again. I promise.
I can hear the word "no." I can.
you couldn't last night.
I really do love you.
Lauren? I was just joking.
I don't think I'm doing that. No. Not intentionally.
Adrian, I just think it was too soon for you to go out again.
it was too soon for you to even meet Dante.
it should not be this big of a deal if a guy doesn't call you back after he went out with you.
that just happens sometimes.
it just feels bad because you're so vulnerable right now.
look, I'm sorry. I know I said I'd find out why he didn't call, but I'm not going to.
I am not going to help you look desperate.
that's how this looks.
and you don't do desperate. You're Adrian.
you should think about that.
Oh Adrian, come in.
I'm just getting paperwork done for all the...
graduates?
Yeah. Which you will be, too. At the end of summer.
I have to graduate with my class. I have to.
I have been through way too much not to get to graduate with all the students I started school with.
please, please, there has to be a way.
I just lost a baby. My marriage is breaking up.
and the guy I went out with last week isn't returning any of my calls or text messages.
you went out with a guy? On a date?
are you and Ben even divorced?
what's a divorce? We're done. It's over.
I have to be at that graduation ceremony in a cap and gown.
please, please, please, appeal to whoever you have to appeal to to get me on that stage.
I'll go to the classes this summer.
I'll finish whatever work I have to do. I just want to be with Ricky.
I mean, Ricky and Jack and all of my friends.
surely, you can find some way to allow me this one happiness after all I've been through.
I'll try.
thank you. I know you can do it.
Oh, oops!
Yeah, like that wasn't intentional.
it wasn't intentional.
fine. Two more weeks and no chance of this ever happening again.
uh, yeah, there is.
don't forget. I got into the same college you got into.
I forgot. But you still have to graduate.
Yes, but the counselor just told me that I might get to go to the graduation with all the rest of you.
I'll just have to finish my requirements this summer.
whatever. - Wait!
slow down!
can't you even have a normal conversation with me?
I'm not after you. I have a boyfriend.
you have a boyfriend? Does your husband know?
um, my soon to be ex-husband.
and it's none of his business. And he doesn't care.
do you care? - No, Adrian, I really don't.
I'm really in love with Amy.
well, you're not married to Amy, are you?
no. - And you're not engaged, are you?
no. - Then you're still technically available.
not for long.
come in.
Oh! Oops. Sorry, wrong apartment. I was looking for Daniel.
Oh. No. Right apartment. Daniel's not here.
Oh. I didn't know he had a roommate.
a good-looking roommate.
you're half right. I am good-looking, but no, he doesn't have a roommate.
I live upstairs. I was just borrowing some food.
or going to. Nothing here.
Oh, you live upstairs? I know someone who lives upstairs.
who's that? - Oh, just some guy.
some really rude, obnoxious guy named Dante.
do you know him?
kind of. - Yeah, well, we went out, and I thought we hit it off, but apparently he was faking it.
I haven't heard from him.
look, you haven't seen him around, have you?
no. He took off when he finished his last final.
he's backpacking across Europe with some guys.
I knew it! I knew there had to be a good reason why he hadn't called me.
well, he could have called you.
I mean, it was last minute, but he could have called you.
especially since you're going through a divorce and all.
Oh, yeah, he told me.
you're Adrian, aren't you?
Yeah. And you are?
his brother. - Yep.
Oh.
Oh.
Hey, your dad let me in.
you didn't tell him we were seeing each other again?
no, because I thought about it, and I don't want to go to any graduation stuff with you.
Lauren's right.
the only reason I'm doing it is because I have zero self-esteem and I probably would have ended up sleeping with you, too, so I changed my mind.
wait a minute, you can't just change your mind.
you're my friend. - No, not really.
I mean, not that good a friend.
I mean, I don't, like, mind talking to you in the hallway and stuff like that, but I don't wanna go out with you.
Madison, come on, I can't go through graduation solo.
no, you can. And you should. You deserve to go solo.
don't be like that. Next year, if you don't have a boyfriend, I'll do it for you.
next year, if I don't have a boyfriend? Ha!
I'm gonna have a boyfriend.
you don't have a boyfriend right now.
I will have a boyfriend by this time next year.
okay, well, I don't have a girlfriend this time this year.
okay? So please. - No.
but Lauren and Jesse and Amy and Ricky are gonna be there.
Lauren broke up with Jesse.
Oh, so that's it. It had nothing to do with being a friend to me.
I told you that. - No, you didn't.
no, I did.
Madison, after all the time we spent together, and all the things we did together, you can't just do this for me?
I really need you.
no, you need to get over Grace. And once you get over Grace, if I'm still around and I haven't found that boyfriend, then, maybe, I'll think about going out with you as a friend.
but not now.
no.
can you say, "Idiot?" Say, "Idiot."
I want to be reminded every day that I'm an idiot.
Hi. - Hi.
sorry to surprise you like this.
no, no, nice surprise.
come in.
what's going on?
well, first of all, you're not an idiot.
okay, maybe just a little bit.
but, I thought about it, and I guess a guy can make a mistake and learn from that mistake, right?
if you're talking about me, yeah.
and I will never make the mistake of pushing you to do anything you don't wanna do.
never, never again. I swear.
all right. - Really?
all right?
Yeah.
I'm kind of afraid to say it again.
don't be.
I love you.
Thanks.
I love you, too.
do you wanna get that?
no. I'm sure it's just Madison.
Hey! It's me, Madison. The new Madison.
Madison with self-esteem.
I told Jack no.
it wasn't easy, but I did it. And I feel really good about it.
so, maybe, graduation night, you and me, we can go do something.
go look for guys together or something.
um, okay. Call me.
I mean, it wasn't too weird, the senior dance, right? We had fun.
so, maybe you two would wanna go to graduation with me.
I mean, Daniel, you didn't even get to go to your own graduation because you graduated early. Maybe you'd enjoy going?
are you asking me out on a date?
Jack. - I can't go by myself.
your parents are gonna be here.
that has loser written all over it.
and taking your ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend wouldn't?
I'm desperate. - Then ask Madison.
maybe she'd go with you. - She already said no.
then find somebody else. There are tons of girls out there, Jack.
I can't just ask someone new to something important like that.
Yeah, you can.
it's a night I'm gonna remember for the rest of my life.
years from now, I'm gonna look back at the pictures and say, "Who is that random girl?"
the girl you took to graduation.
fine. Forget it.
he's a nut.
Oh, no. No. You're not feeling sorry for him, are you?
well, it's his senior year, and I don't know...
okay, Grace, that's it.
I can't deal with your friends and all their issues.
what? - I'm crazy about you. I am.
and if you want to have a relationship with me, it's gotta be just you and me.
not you and me and Adrian and the neighbors.
or you and me and Jack.
or you and me and your mother.
Alice, are you okay?
Yeah, thanks, Mr. Boykewich.
I'm just waiting on Ben to get home. If you don't mind.
no. No, I don't mind.
Henry broke up with me.
what? You two have been together forever.
I know. But when we go to college, he wants to go to separate colleges.
that's a whole year away from now.
I know.
he broke up with me a year in advance.
he just ruined my senior year. Maybe even my life.
don't cry, Alice. It'll be okay.
I'll find Ben for you and get him over here.
it's just that I've never dated anyone else.
I'm gonna have to start all over.
I don't wanna start all over.
I want Henry. And Henry doesn't want me.
would you mind calling me? I would really like to talk to you.
love, Leo.
I'll have the usual.
I'll just have some bread. Thanks.
Ugh. I can't eat. I still feel sick.
did you think this through, Henry?
no. I didn't think it through.
it's just been in the back of my mind for months and then all of a sudden it was out of my mouth.
I was gonna wait until this time next year.
you were gonna wait until next year knowing this is how you feel about Alice?
I know, I know.
I feel guilty about even having sex with her these past few months.
but it's not that I don't love her. It's just that...
I don't think I love her enough to think about making any kind of commitment.
well, you two were friends before you ever got together, so I'm sure you'll be friends again.
my mom said, "Friends to lovers forever."
lovers to friends, never.
never heard that one.
Yeah. Me neither.
but I think she might be right.
Alice isn't gonna want to be my friend.
but you two should be friends.
of course.
not too close of a friend.
Henry, I would never...
Yeah, you say that now, but you're vulnerable and she's vulnerable.
Henry, no. It's not gonna happen.
don't let it happen, please.
you're... You're not thinking right.
Henry, you're my best friend.
so is Alice.
I wish you'd talked to me before this happened.
maybe I could have done something.
I don't want you to do anything.
I hate that this is happening, but it had to happen.
I can't just keep screwing up my SATs.
Oh, hi. - Hi.
I didn't realize you'd be here. I can go do something else.
Oh, no, that's okay.
I think I might be here for a few days.
I have this really huge project and I can't drive back and forth or I'll never get it done.
but I think once it's done, I might be taking a little vacation.
good for you.
so where's our old man?
Oh, he's taking Robie and Moose for a walk.
I don't how you did it.
I mean, he's a little immature, for lack of a better word.
Yeah. Charming, but immature.
you're right. I don't think there really is a better word.
but you must love him, right?
I mean, you had three children with him, so you must really love him.
I guess.
but not enough to be with him every day.
it might be love, but it's a really low flame.
got it.
and you? Don't you have a girlfriend?
someone who works with Ruben or something? Amy told me.
Yeah. Didn't work out.
turns out I'm immature.
well, then, you and George should make good roommates.
you sure you don't mind if I stay here?
Oh, I don't mind. I don't know how Ashley will feel when she gets home.
do you have any idea when that will be?
I talk to her on the phone every night.
I think she might be getting a little bored, but I also don't think she'll ever be back here.
Ashley's wanted to be someplace else since she was 13 years old.
so maybe she'll get her own apartment, or, best case scenario, she'll wanna go to college.
she's really a smart girl.
she's got a smart mother.
Hey, thanks for sticking around.
couldn't have got that delivery put away without you.
no problem. Just doing my job.
Yeah. Where is Prince Boykewich today?
I don't know. You don't know?
said he had personal business.
Hey, Ricky. Hey, Bunny.
Hey, little man.
he had a really good day today.
he was outside running around all day, so he's gonna sleep really good tonight.
Oh, great.
I stopped by and picked up your favorite movie you've always wanted me to see.
seven Samurai? - Yes.
Oh, good one. Enjoy that.
and I stopped by the new Chinese restaurant on the corner, and guess what?
what? - They have those scallion pancakes.
Yeah. The ones you liked from the Chinese place in New York.
thought that Chinese food would go really good with the movie, so I ordered dinner. And I'm buying.
Wow. Thanks.
but you know, samurai are Japanese, not Chinese, not that it matters.
Oh.
there aren't any sushi places around.
I'd rather have Chinese anyway.
okay.
well, then, I guess I'll see you upstairs.
what if we all put on our pajamas right away, wouldn't that be fun?
I don't have pajamas. - I know.
so, you got her just where you want her, don't you?
what? - What's going on?
nothing. Life is good.
I know you. You're up to something.
no, she's up to something. She's trying to get a proposal out of me.
And? - And I intend to enjoy that.
Yeah, well, don't take that too far.
I won't. I really love Amy.
are you gonna propose to her?
I'd tell you, but I know you don't like to discuss personal business at work.
night, Bunny.
starboard is a tuna boat with its heap of nets in the back and the skiff on the poop deck.
the skiff holds one end of the net as the boat circles a tuna shoal.
most tuna boats are at sea now.
they make 3-month excursions off the coasts of Libya, Malta, Cyprus,
turkey and the Balearic Islands.
there, on the right, those are trawlers. Those boats over there.
on either side of the seine are grids to hold the nets open horizontally when it's dredging behind the boat.
they go out on day trips, Monday through Friday, from 2 in the morning to mid-afternoon, until the boss says they have enough.
that's the fish crier's compartment.
it got its name because there once was a man yelling what fish they had, and the price.
now that's all over. Everything's on computer.
the SECRET OF THE GRAIN
that's the scrap area.
that's where scrapiron is stored, before being shipped to Turkey.
there used to be ovens in France. We lost the matches.
unless it's a manpower problem.
Marie, take over a minute!
God damn!
over there, concrete blocks are piled, forming a breakwater.
this is crazy, Madeleine. Stop!
what's crazy? This?
I'm working.
this is no time.
it's exciting!
hurt me.
it's not the time.
if you look behind you, on the left you can see boats pulled ashore for repair.
this is called the harbor careening area.
that's where repairs are made to the boat's underside, meaning every part which is immersed.
Rudders, paint, propellers, etc.
Slimane! Slimane!
what is it?
so a schedule is toilet paper?
what schedule?
I made one up. You werert on it this morning.
you talk schedules and deadlines. How can I finish?
you don't finish the job!
this project is stagnating.
we've been at it 3 days!
Exactly! It's been 3 days! - Talk about schedules.
3 days is too much. I can't wait.
that's the problem. This project's going nowhere.
if you can't move these jobs, what do I tell the others?
jose, quit it. I'm talking to Slimane.
it's not your business. Keep out of it.
everyone stops. When does the job get done?
you play me for a fool!
what's the idea? What's up with this job?
it should be done!
you read the schedules now.
don't ask questions and things will be simple.
you're making my life difficult.
I'll read that schedule...
I had to cut your hours.
it's early. Things are still slow.
I don't get it.
look on the bright side.
you'll have time with your grandkids.
to go fishing.
who asked you?
I got my orders.
we're over quota for man hours.
listen, we're trying to stave off the worst.
anybody who's not happy...
don't give me that stare.
I said don't!
you want me out, is that it?
I only said it's slow now.
can't pay you to loaf.
I work.
I know.
I do my job. - I know.
I've worked 35 years.
35 years.
in salt.
between the sea and the yard.
so what?
you're not profitable anymore.
you're tired and you're tiresome. That's the truth.
you had 2 days to finish that boat.
two days is two days. Not 21/2, not 3.
know what you're costing me?
there's work to be done on that boat.
I don't know.
I'm not a businessman anyway.
you don't know what work that boat needed. You don't.
I'm sorry for you, Slimane.
I don't get you.
Ren? made you a good offer. You said no.
I've been on the yard since '69.
Ren? says I got 16 years in.
not even half of the truth.
not our fault you were off the books.
we took over in '90.
what happened before...
I don't get it. - You don't?
I don't. Tell me.
you know, but you won't say it. How long have I been on the yard?
you have to choose.
you want to go on working, you accept flexible hours.
otherwise... - What?
you know our conditions. How many times do I have to tell you?
all right, I got it.
you got it.
I hope you got it.
how are you?
guess what happened to us?
what?
got stopped in the no fishing zone. Really hurt us.
the fat guy who used to be a crier.
right, Henri? - He hates us.
bastard.
he had a field day.
smiling, from ear to ear.
I said, "Come on, be reasonable. I got overhead.
2, 000 euros fine and banned for a week.
stubborn ass.
we all got a job. We fish. He gives out fines.
you better be careful. There's no more work.
now I've got work trouble.
I told you, they want us out.
I told you to get out.
either get out, or they'll throw you out.
anyway, till you get fed up...
Hey, that's how life is.
life is not all rosy.
what did Michel say last night?
he needs help to break up that old boat, a Source.
lots of work. - An old freighter.
3 or 4 guys, a week's work.
Yeah, I'd say two weeks.
honest boss, he'll pay you.
you got no worries.
I worked for him. He's straight up.
give him some fish.
I'll just sort it and I will.
aziz, pass me the crate.
pass me the fish, please.
Jeremy, sort a while so I can serve Slimane.
not a lot.
that OK?
just 2 or 3 mullet and that's fine.
I'll clean them.
give him more.
I give him the crate?
I'm not kidding.
that's all I needed.
I got to pay the diesel bill.
Riadh! Riadh!
out of the bathroom!
turn that shower off!
I just got in!
you don't pay the phone, the water, the electric!
end of the month, nobody helps me.
shoes!
smells like fish.
no, it doesn't. It's fresh. It smells like the sea.
the sea...
then I clean it and I smell like the sea.
it's cleaned, don't worry.
clean or not, it won't pay the bills.
you never eat fish here?
we do. You think we're cats?
all day long, fish and more fish.
what good is bringing me fish?
bring caviar while you're at it.
you missed two alimony payments!
all selfish! Everyone around me is selfish!
what am I supposed to do?
I am not happy!
don't look at me like that.
you know what you did. I said, "Pee?" You said, "No."
ask for the potty.
bad girl. Sit on the potty. Go!
sit down!
sit, or I'll get mad.
Hi, Dad.
she didn't ask for the potty. So here we go again.
she's little. - No! She knows what she did.
got a kiss for Grandpa?
come. - She stays on the pot!
leave her alone. What's done is done.
don't you move!
let her be.
it's nothing.
don't yell.
she gets on my nerves.
I keep telling her.
want to stay in diapers forever?
dad!
let her be.
let me wash the dirty girl. I didn't wash her!
let her be.
bad girl.
lucky she didn't get spanked today.
pretty girl.
she's not pretty, she's bad. A very bad girl.
she knows she's off the hook.
look!
you're disgusting.
little piggy.
you lucked out. You'll see next time.
Hi, Grandpa! - Hi, hon.
give Grandpa a kiss.
finish eating.
sit down here.
did you eat?
this isn't over!
I'm not too hungry.
no more peeing in diapers!
a little coffee.
answer me. It's over. Now it's the potty.
see that? When she's in your arms... And she knows it!
you lucked out. We'll see later.
mom, leave my sister alone.
she still pees in diapers, at her age!
you were out of diapers.
wait, Dad. Eat first. Why the coffee?
I'm not hungry.
you ate before?
what did the cowboy want?
come on, eat. You keep talking and you're not done.
what did he want?
they made schedules. I'm on half-time.
you asked for it?
tell them no.
anyway, they're reviewing personnel. They want no Frenchmen.
the old guys are out.
no, the French.
that way, no hassles.
sugar? Dad, the doctor...
I had sugar.
dad, you put sugar in it.
he didn't, I did.
why'd you put sugar out?
I've worked there since Jose was born.
did they give me a contract?
they could have. They don't want Frenchmen.
it has been a while. - What can I do?
you got to act. It's like you're afraid.
afraid of what? - Exactly!
what should I say?
you say nothing. You stay... - What?
you could keep this up 10 years.
till your hair turns white.
then they'll fire you. Great.
at the cannery...
Safia, enough! Want to go potty again?
want to go potty?
it's all right.
no, you stay here or you go potty.
so, at the cannery, we get bonuses. They tried to eliminate them.
the guy they sent, the VP, said they'd lost American markets.
just like that, one day they say, you lose this cause we lost that.
so just like that, we organized. Everyone in the cafeteria.
we made signs. We went on strike, stopped working.
when they saw the line stopped, they needed us, they all came out of the woodwork.
they watched how they spoke to us.
we were all there, ready to go the limit.
we said if we have to set a fire, we'll set a fire.
but our bonuses don't go. Don't even try it.
considering what we get paid...
so when they came...
we'd elected... what's her name?
your co-worker's wife. - Lionel?
his wife. I don't know her very well. Melanie?
Melanie was our spokesperson. She went to them and said, no one goes back to work until we get our bonuses.
I swear, quick as lightning, we got our bonuses. They got scared.
they can't just do anything. - Yes, they can.
ask your father. - No way.
they're tired of benefits and withholding.
they outsource. Somewhere guys get 10 bucks a week.
anybody in there? - Yes!
they take advantage of people who are making a pittance.
they're the best. They do that very well.
and they keep lining their pockets.
so every year, you hear the same line.
on TV, that's all you hear.
you watch too much TV. - People are too passive.
no, it comes down from above.
it's shameful.
that's how it is. Half as many boats in 10 years.
then one day, no more boats.
just a marina. No more fishing boats.
no more yard. Only tourists.
for them: Less hassle, more money.
they take advantage of people.
I brought some fish.
again?
you just brought us some.
that's a lot.
it's good for the kids.
not even a thank you.
Thanks. But I get some at the cannery.
not the same. This is fresh, for the kids.
that's true, you're right.
don't look at me like that, you little piggy!
she'll remember this day.
I'm running late. Dad, can you drop me off?
we'll go together. - Fine.
don't want a bite first?
no. Tonight I...
give Grandpa a hug.
hug Grandpa and I won't be mad anymore.
I'll hug him, too.
good thing I have you, Dad.
don't worry. It'll work out.
they can't change your life.
you too, give Mom a hug. Oh, you're a sweetheart.
and Grandpa.
my kids adore you!
jose, come here.
show them Grandpa's nice fish.
he thinks of us.
careful, don't fall.
can I touch? - Are your hands clean?
I'm going.
nice, right?
don't touch too much.
look at the fish. Show her the fish.
in water, he moves this.
look at that fish.
see that?
it's Nemo.
they got big teeth.
Hi.
how are you?
I brought fish.
sure you're OK?
Hi, Slimane. - Hello, Rym.
you OK?
some fish. - Let me see.
havert had any in a long time.
mullet. The yellow kind!
that is super cool. Thanks.
make it tonight? - No problem.
how are you?
mom see this?
what did she say?
coming back down?
come, let's go to sleep.
I don't get it.
it doesn't matter.
I didn't really want to either.
come and sleep.
what are you doing?
I'm going back to my room.
what's the matter?
what's going on?
not in your room.
I don't feel right.
how long do we go on this way?
the guests...
that's your place. Then I come here...
it's just that the bed is bigger.
you know, I'm just a guest.
stop.
you're independent.
you're young.
you like life, you like freedom.
I've done nothing, left nothing to you and Rym, to my children.
why are you saying this?
it's not moist enough.
I put it in already. I can't take it out now.
like this?
a little less.
another potato peeler headed for the trash.
can't go any faster?
mom, she's not great at dishes.
I'll get it. - Go.
don't forget, shoes off.
what took so long?
scared you?
shoes! - I took them off.
Hi, honey.
wow, lots of work.
how are you?
easy on the harissa. - We know.
and the kids?
on the balcony. Go ahead.
Thanks. Nice change from fish.
Hi, honey.
Hey, sweetie.
what are you drinking? - I'll have...
Olfa! Olfa!
bring a glass and a beer.
give him the big plate.
that's the plate.
she's pretty! - Pretty, right?
Hi, Henri. - Hi, Lilia.
your daughter's pretty. - Thanks.
how old is she now?
almost two.
time sure does fly.
tell Auntie how old you are. Show her.
two. Just two fingers.
five?
she's so smart.
incredible.
and still in diapers?
I can't get rid of them.
and I work at it every day.
try the potty? - Sure. I put her on it.
she won't go on the potty.
just to sit her down on it, she has a fit.
soon as I take her off, then she goes.
cause she yells at her.
I don't yell.
it's not her fault. It's the diaper companies.
the new diapers absorb a whole quart.
kids get used to it. They don't get it.
even wet, they feel dry.
see what I mean?
they're shock absorbers.
they fall, get right back up.
it's true.
that's why they do it.
take one out, throw it away. Take another...
see the price at the supermarket?
she uses 5 a day.
how long does one pack last?
not even a week!
how much is it? - 15 euros.
Olfa, the calculator!
fifteen is a lot.
that's not even a week!
thirty to a pack...
here comes the details.
this will take all afternoon.
the diaper budget!
six times three...
math and me...
wait.
six a day. A pack is five days.
that makes 6 packs a month.
600 F. Times twelve.
imagine in 2 years.
7, 200 F a year!
look at the face he's making!
OK, everybody! Let's go.
hurry up. Julia, go get dressed. Please.
everyone's downstairs. They made couscous.
what the hell is this? Julia!
Serguei! Serguei!
Serguei, tell your sister or I'll get crazy.
all right.
stop talking in Russian.
look in my eyes, go get dressed.
I said no! That's French! I'm not coming!
why are you yelling? - You don't listen!
come back to earth.
go down to your mother's! Go eat!
you wait for your brother to pull this shit?
Hi, Serguei.
what's going on? - They're manic.
I just got here. It's crazy.
what set it off?
I don't know. I got here, Julia was upset.
I think Majid got in about six or seven in the morning.
Julia found stuff in his jacket.
condoms or girls' phone numbers. I don't know.
you know your brother.
let's go get dad.
come on, get up!
I've had enough!
leave me alone!
what the hell is this?
get out before I go crazy!
get out! Your mama's calling!
stop yelling.
look at her!
and I'm crazy!
you're crazy, yes!
majid, there's a baby in the house.
a little respect.
you just wait! - Who do you think I am?
get out! You're a pain in the ass! Majid!
garbage!
what? What's going on?
when your sister's here! Big man!
go downstairs or I swear I'm going to lose it.
mom's waiting.
you'll see tonight!
what will I see?
shut the fuck up!
he went downstairs. It's over.
put this off a day.
it's hard. Sorry.
come downstairs, Julia.
go change. Do it for me.
the marital fights are later. This is not the time.
lilia wants to see you. She asked for Hakim.
everyone's there. It's good vibes, good times.
Yeah, good times. - Easy.
everyone's waiting for you. We're all happy. Come downstairs.
don't worry, it'll be all right.
please. Get up and change.
we'll see about this later.
come on, Julia. Please.
OK, Karima. But only for you.
fine, no problem.
cause it's hard.
I'll get dressed. - Go ahead.
Serguei, come have dinner.
I'll come down with her. I'll just change the baby.
OK, see you there.
let's go.
all right, what is this crap?
it's nothing.
we all know about your bullshit.
what bullshit? I went out for a drink.
and all those girls? - What girls?
what is this shit? We all fucking know!
I'm talking here. - You heard rumors?
you're too stupid to be discreet.
get out. I didn't do anything. I got in late one night.
late one night?
like I don't know where you hang out?
get out. - Like I don't know?
you got a kid. You're married. You forget?
now stop acting like a kid.
and get it straight that you got a family.
hello Mrs. Jilali. - Hi, kids.
been to the market? Not too crowded?
not too bad.
and your health?
how's your mom? Your dad?
just fine.
say hello to them for me? - I will.
bye now. Take care.
you piss me off!
want some onions?
mom, one more place. Serguei's coming.
honey, give me the kids' plates.
serve the kids first.
you're looking peaked!
give me your plate. You can bone the fish.
everybody got some?
did everyone get sauce?
and vegetables?
enjoy your meal, everybody.
it's prepared with love.
love. The couscous of love.
it's absolutely delicious.
the vegetables are just right.
Souad, you're talented for couscous.
Julia! Julia!
it's about time.
sorry we're late. Sorry, Souad.
you go through midtown? We've been waiting.
Hey, handsome. He's a little warm.
Yeah, his bottom's all red. I can't settle him down.
I went through hell when Thomas was a baby.
want your mommy?
azza honey, got everything?
are they eating?
no worries.
Safia, listen to your auntie.
I thought it was Slimane.
Hi, everyone!
the most beautiful!
you OK?
it's a family day today.
where is he?
Henri, the girls!
my fault. I had car trouble. I needed his help.
like I don't?
I completely forgot.
we'll talk later.
where do I sit?
I'll get you a plate.
when you got nice cold ones, you forget your woman.
and you turned your cell off. Voice mail!
now you're dead.
Souad, serve her. She's starving.
just a little. I'm on a diet.
don't start with me today. - I didn't say a word.
your couscous is great, Mom. - Got that right.
no peppers? - I can't eat without that.
go get them. They're in the pan.
orange juice.
here, Majid.
Majid's not talking.
something wrong?
Yeah, today he's pretty silent.
all that partying last night.
see? He eats at Grandma's.
here's Grandma's couscous.
all smiles, so happy.
see that?
better than fish sticks.
quit arguing. Have some. Enough for everyone!
I don't want any. I'll leave my share.
Riadh special! - Very nice!
Olfa, some bread!
I love it. - How do you do it?
I made the peppers and helped with the couscous.
when she does something, she says so. It's so rare!
she has helped her mom all day long.
may I have some more grain?
with pleasure.
werert you on a diet?
give her a break. Women and diets!
she said so. Right away, "I'm on a diet.
now she's changing.
good. I'm getting fat, but it's good.
no. When you start to eat, you say Besmellah.
Gesmela! Gesmela!
not a "G," a "B."
there. You got it.
know any other Arabic words?
Barafemuk
one of my first!
that's all you taught him, Lilia? - A few others.
we don't speak Arabic at home.
with your wife, you must have learned some things.
curse words!
you learned a few words.
you know, when...
what? - When we're alone.
naturally.
when we make love.
get out of here.
don't believe him.
she often says...
Mezze, Mario - Often! - It's not true.
don't believe it. - He's shameless.
he's going wild.
but you do teach the kids?
not... - Yes.
more Thomas. - The boys understand.
a little bit.
when does your mom speak Arabic?
when she's mad.
then you understand, when she's mad?
what does she say? Remember?
she says lots of things.
only when she's mad?
that true, Lilia?
they understand my mother.
they're used to it. - My aunts.
they're exposed to it.
easier for them than for me. When your mother was visiting...
they spoke Arabic all the time. I couldn't stand it.
I kept saying, "What?" Remember?
I didn't understand.
I had to constantly translate. She made an effort.
she did, yes.
it's handy for secrets with my friends.
so he doesn't understand.
right. And I don't.
they're all there...
they're having tea.
it's true, sometimes I feel uneasy.
it's like I get the feeling they're talking about me, like...
they're making fun of me.
you never made the effort to learn. I keep offering.
true. - You never did.
I don't have the time. - I taught you a few words.
what did you teach him?
I love you," and "darling."
so?
don't remember?
close.
that it?
listen to her say it.
he'll never get it right.
I'll get it.
Yeah, you can.
maybe in 5 or 10 years...
can I have a plate for the kids? - Of course.
one for the neighbor. I'll bring it.
already did it.
I saw her before. She says hi, asked for Dad.
there's a plate for your father. Bring it later, boys.
I'll go with Riadh.
you two are going?
least he's worth it. Not like some.
we miss him around here.
what do you want? That's life.
love, love!
love, huh?
that's not love.
sure it is, Mom. It's a gesture of love.
then what is it?
love... - It is love.
that's ichra.
it's stronger than love.
it's habit. It's all in there. Love, friendship, everything.
own your feelings. You love him, that's all.
Souad, if I may, from that plate, I know there's still love.
there's a difference between Dad's and the neighbor's.
it was made with love. - You can tell.
I make the couscous with love.
love...
takes everyday maintenance.
it's getting along.
but... you have to earn it.
dad's a good man. He deserves better.
isn't he? He worked 35 years for his family.
what else you want? - It's not a mzia if it's a duty.
but he did his duty. We never wanted for anything when we were little. He was always there.
now I can get by on my own, but...
he was around!
listen, all of you. Either you quit messing around or I get the laundry list out!
every Sunday, laundry list.
every Sunday, she tells the same story.
enough.
don't fight now. - We're not.
I love Dad and Mom.
majid, get those peppers away from her.
a husband like that, I would never let him go.
take him!
look, Mom's jealous.
you're jealous. You still love him!
how's the couscous?
mom did good.
we sure loved it.
I had two plates full.
Yeah, it was good.
they're a fucking drag.
I don't know how you live in this dump.
how can you stay here?
go back to the old country.
Majid's right, Dad.
you got nothing here. It's all there.
sunshine, friends. - And the house.
Yeah, Mom said she'd leave you the house.
go whenever you want.
you just leave it for her when she comes.
don't need it.
you'll feel good there now. It'll be great.
you'll be super healthy, I know it.
you live in a dump.
even Karima said you'd be better off there.
she'll bring the kids on vacation.
I'll bring Hakim.
we'll stay together.
put in some time.
I'll think it over.
Yeah, think.
Hey, Rym. - Leave me some?
I did. Come in.
I won't interrupt. - Come in.
no, I'm OK. - Come in.
not long.
how are you?
how you doing?
sit down.
I could smell it downstairs.
how are you, Majid?
good.
I saw your son, with your wife.
he's bigger. - Yeah.
how old is he?
10 months. - Already? Time flies.
he's beautiful. - Thanks.
your wife looked a little tired. - A little.
she lost weight. - Yeah, she did.
worries, huh?
delicious.
havert had couscous like this in a while.
sorry. When there's couscous the world disappears for me!
eat the fish.
here, some peppers.
they're good.
really nice.
super good.
have some squash. - Give me.
not talking?
lost your tongues?
dad.
think about what I said.
nothing's keeping you here.
you should go back home.
you could start a business, with the severance pay.
severance talk going around town already?
I swear I didn't say anything.
people talk.
people love to talk.
they say the yard's over.
that you got severance, like severance payments?
good?
great. Never had one so good.
tell your mother.
no problem.
I could eat this every day.
I've done that.
I could explode. I'll sleep good.
your sons are really hard.
especially Majid.
Why?
they want you to go back home. What does that mean?
they want to get rid of you?
are they messing with you?
like you need them to tell you what to do.
like it's for your own good. - I let them talk.
Yeah, you do. I noticed you let them talk.
I swear! No respect.
you're home. This is your room.
and we're your family. You're like my father, I mean it.
what's that? "Nothing's keeping you here.
the gall. Right in front of me.
people have no respect. Who does he think he is?
don't pay him any mind.
I can't accept that.
no way. What's France, a whore house? Let him go back. Good riddance.
he thinks France is a whore house.
I'd have told him, but out of respect for you and the couscous...
only because he's your son.
he really got on my nerves. Really!
you like Riadh?
he's OK.
gets on my nerves!
don't mind what he says.
why'd you say you'd think it over?
because I don't mind what he says.
he thinks that means yes.
let him talk.
say nothing, let him talk. You'll see what happens.
he gets confident, talks about it again.
don't let him, OK?
make some more coffee.
Yeah, but just by letting him...
you have to talk.
you just sit there.
bastard.
he gets me crazy.
why doesn't he sing? - I don't know.
sing.
remember how he used to sing?
he almost never does now. I don't know.
what's wrong with him?
look, he's eating couscous.
I didn't leave you much.
people!
see how children are?
acting big.
that's not right.
such a traitor.
funny seeing him here. Most Sundays he's with his whores.
I know stuff about him I don't tell you.
lots of talk I heard.
he should go hide back home.
don't be mad, it's nothing.
he's lost it.
your sors got a problem.
it's nothing. Forget all that.
says my hotel is a dump.
like his face isn't?
don't tell your mother.
if Mom heard that...
we'd be in deep shit.
worked all her life to buy this.
she's a woman. Not a man.
all he knows how to do is talk.
least we got a hotel.
you making the coffee?
there's the boat, my child.
want to board?
lots of work.
come in.
Hello, Mr. Beji, Miss...
please sit down.
well?
what brings you here?
I'm here to ask for a loan.
my father wants to open a restaurant on a boat he's just acquired.
we prepared a dossier to present our project.
Congratulations.
let's have a look.
there are some mistakes.
I see that.
is that all?
we only just started working.
you realize it's a little light.
especially in view of the sum you request.
45, 000 euros, that's a nice chunk.
we need it for the renovation.
that sum will only cover the renovation costs?
no. It also covers equipment, kitchen, decor, tables, chairs. All that.
how about operating costs? How will you cover that?
have you thought about start-up funds?
no, but we can work it out. It's no problem.
my stepfather worked on the yard.
all his co-workers will pitch in.
and when it comes to personnel, we'll have free labor.
it's all family. So we'll save a lot of money, right?
Yes, but you must understand, I can't put that on paper.
I have to satisfy my superiors. If I go in saying, "Mr. Beji and all his friends and family will do it all,
it won't fly.
I need a projected budget, with much more detail, with estimates from established and serious professionals.
how did you come to these figures anyway?
did you do any market studies?
no, we just got the application from the Chamber of Commerce.
Mr. Beji, if I recall correctly, you're now unemployed.
you were laid off?
Yes, but I got my severance pay.
and I get unemployment.
right.
you want to change careers. Very commendable.
but let me ask you a few questions.
your chosen business, restaurants, is a very difficult one right now.
first of all, where would it be located?
actually, we'd like it to be located on the Quai de la Roublique, if possible.
have you asked for an authorization?
it's pending.
sure there's a spot open?
but the tuna boat guys told me there's a spot open.
they said so.
perhaps, but you need the permission of local authorities.
there are many restaurants already.
Yes, but none that makes fish couscous.
that's true.
so I want to try my luck.
it is an original idea.
is that the only specialty?
for now, fish couscous is the house exclusive.
but, of course, we'll make up a full menu, with various combinations.
and we'll rent it out for parties, baptisms, circumcisions, weddings.
and we had another idea.
during Ramadan, we'll turn it into a warm meeting place for our community to gather share ideas, our culture, and to eat. Because...
they don't have much in this city. We've got ideas.
of course, even people outside our community are welcome.
I see. How old are you, Mr. Beji?
sixty-one.
look, this all seems a little fresh.
though your project doesn't seem uninteresting at all!
it just needs fleshing out.
so I suggest you come back to me with a complete work-up.
with a detailed projected budget, with professional estimates, including operating expenses, personnel you wish to hire, a target number for meals served, and how many meals per day will put you in the black.
and have a CPA sign off on it.
and of course the additional paperwork we spoke about.
the customs license, the docking authorization, and the collateral you can put up.
the collateral is the boat. That's all.
that's it.
I'm afraid that won't be enough.
it's in bad shape.
I saw the photo. How much is it won'th?
10, 000 euros.
seriously. That's not enough.
ten thousand.
compared to the sum you want to borrow, that's nothing.
it'll be won'th much more, once we renovate.
perhaps, Miss.
maybe I lack imagination to speculate on such a project but I can guarantee you, with this plan, 5, 000 is the most you can hope for.
maybe!
those folders are great. We can print them.
what is it? - Hello.
tell them OK. Forget the rest.
are you Mr. Dorner? - Yes.
we have an appointment.
an appointment? With me?
Yes, they do.
OK, what about?
for an authorization.
an authorization? For what?
I have... a boat.
let me explain. We want to open a restaurant on a boat.
turn a boat into a restaurant.
so we came to see you to obtain the authorization.
I heard about that. That the file? - Yes, here.
and this boat-restaurant, where is it now?
at the G-0 dock.
the Source."
got some work to do.
where do you want to put it?
Quai de la Roublique.
that's not easy.
Quai de la Roublique. Everyone wants to be there.
I don't know if there's room.
did you inquire?
Yes. The tuna boat guys said there was a spot.
Yes, there's a spot open.
might be one for a tuna boat.
but a restaurant?
a couscous place at that.
not easy.
might be a spot, but you have to ask the port authority.
the tuna boatmen don't decide. We'll verify that.
and the customs license?
we see them next week.
I need that license. - We'll bring it.
and you're getting a bank loan? Did you get it yet, or not?
the bank is waiting for the city to grant authorization.
they want the city's opinion?
right.
the city wants financing before granting authorization.
look, we at the city will study the feasibility, to see if it's viable.
if it is, we'll transfer it over to the police authority.
but right now I can't tell you anything more.
check back with my secretary.
get what's missing to her.
sorry I didn't have more time, but I'm running late today.
have a nice day. - See you soon.
make sure they get everything I requested.
from the bank. They'll be back.
a letter stating they've applied.
without the loan, where are they going with this?
what's keeping you?
I'm done.
I don't have much time for lunch.
I've got yoga today.
ever run a restaurant? - No, ma'am.
and your kitchens are up to safety standards?
french law is very strict about that.
we're renovating.
renovating or not, I'm warning you:
to be licensed, and to keep that license, you need the Health Dept. Certificate.
that's how it works in France.
you're going into a business with very strict rules on hygiene.
in France anyway.
anything concerning a new restaurant opening, the kitchens must be up to code.
we... I can give you the license in one day.
I can deliver it to you right now.
but if you have an inspection, and if the inspector judges that your kitchers not up to code, you can get permanently shut down. And my hands will be tied.
you understand what I'm saying?
so, you have to go back to the bank and explain what I just told you, that you came to see us, and since you're putting up the boat,
I don't see why they wouldn't finance your plan.
especially since you have property.
in any case, as for us, it's French law and there are no exceptions.
that's it. Do you understand?
Hey, Riadh.
Hey, how are you?
good.
making progress. - Little at a time.
not too rough? - It's all right.
come and eat.
Yeah, thanks.
how are you, Slimane?
kitchers looking mean. Real nice.
you like the blue?
gorgeous.
really nice.
not too tired? - I'm all right.
the paint works wonders.
looks great.
come sit down and eat, two minutes.
Oh, I saw Rabah, the grocer.
he said if you want to shop on his card, it's tomorrow.
Riadh! - I told him.
call him.
no, let it go. I called him.
Riadh! - Coming!
come and eat.
I bet you didn't eat at all.
that's no good. Cigarette, coffee...
you work hard. You have to eat.
you like it? - Gorgeous. Totally.
Really?
it's clean now.
there's a little tidying up to do.
but that'll go quick.
I'll sleep here tonight.
mom won't like that.
she gave me lip. - I know.
you don't care. You're above that. Don't mess everything up, OK?
tell her.
I got a head full of worries. - I know.
I'm not sure I can get the authorization, the loan and all.
I keep explaining.
Yeah, I know.
your mother's got to understand.
she does. She's pretending.
look, you got all this work to do.
don't get caught up in all this stuff. Who cares?
so you'll come home after, OK?
we'll see. - Stop.
do it for me. Who cares about her? We don't care.
what good is it? I get back, she looks at me crooked.
we'll look crooked right back at her.
come on.
please come home tonight.
we'll see. - Please.
that sandwich any good?
Oh yeah, it's good.
you made it?
then it's good.
Thanks.
you OK, Dad?
fine.
finished up there? - Yeah, almost.
then you come down. We'll finish the kitchen tonight.
Yeah, it'll be quick.
don't forget to close everything up.
if no one's watching, turn the TV off!
what's with her?
she's pitching another fit.
a fit?
pitching a fit? You're not in her shoes.
she's got reasons.
you know, since this restaurant thing...
what restaurant?
you know Slimane's opening a restaurant on a boat?
that's why she's like that.
he bought a boat?
what do you mean, bought?
he picked up a wreck ready to be junked.
that boat, still in the same place.
falling apart. - Right.
at the end of the dock?
that's the one. That's right.
make a restaurant out of that boat? What's he got, a screw loose?
seriously.
a couscous place, he said.
couscous on a boat?
it's an old idea of his.
he's right. Life is tough.
it's a good idea.
hang on, hang on.
fixing up that boat takes dough. That's not easy.
you need a lot. It's not free.
he got something on his layoff.
not much.
his age, he wants to take a shot at a restaurant?
hostesses, kitchens, hours...
not easy.
it's complicated.
Yeah, but he does have his two kids.
those two!
they're lazy! - We know them.
counting on them...
of course he's counting on them.
and what's more, his ex-wife is doing the cooking.
I get it now. Souad!
that's why Latifa is...
now you see?
I've seen them.
they had an all-out.
she broke the place up. All over the place.
he was going to leave. The girl stopped him.
Yeah, for her it's a humiliation. He betrayed her.
he humiliated her.
right.
just imagine.
because when he lost his job, she thought, maybe with the severance he gets, he could help her fix up the hotel and all.
no. Now she sees him, he wants to open a restaurant on a boat, put his kids to work.
it's a revolution.
wait.
with his ex-wife's couscous!
imagine the situation.
she's like a crazy person.
she's like crazy.
but you got to understand him.
you know Slimane and his pride.
he doesn't want to be a kept man, or look like a pimp.
see what I mean?
this situation is very serious.
it's no good for one, no good for the other.
it's a really weird situation.
it's not easy.
just between us...
you know one time I tasted Latifa's couscous.
it was inedible. Terrible.
we ate it anyway, out of friendship.
but I mean it was awful.
totally tasteless.
but Latifa's nice. I like her.
she's nice but she can't make couscous.
she's very nice.
did his wife say yes?
she's no picnic either.
Yeah, but how he put it to her.
for the good of the kids...
Yeah, because he's got no money, no authorization.
in the bargain!
tough. Starting with nothing.
that's tough.
he's putting together like a party, to raise money. He invited some big shots.
like a test.
to show he can do it. See?
whers his party going to be?
that I don't know. The girl must know.
I'll ask.
Rym? Rym?
come here a second. - Coming.
what is it?
tell me, have you seen Slimane around?
you know when his restaurant party is going to be?
when he's done renovating.
it's tough. Only Riadh's helping.
he's no pro. Slimane has to be there, tell him what to do.
right.
tell him we'll help. He's a friend.
tell him we're here.
he didn't dare.
no, really. - I'll tell him.
we'll all help.
what is this test evening?
no, he means the big party.
it's not a test.
they turned him down.
the bank, the customs, the money, the authorization.
so he decided to give this big, big dinner party.
and invite all the inside people, the big shots.
he'll present his project right, show them it's a good idea.
so they'll invest.
see? - That's good.
good idea.
he can't give up. Got to go for it.
it's like us, when we audition for gigs?
right, sort of.
I get it.
does he want musicians for his audition?
he didn't say. I could ask him.
I think he wants pros.
you are professionals.
we are professionals.
why go looking? Here we are.
why go elsewhere? - Don't be hurt.
hey listen, if he wants this party, how about doing it free?
why not?
all you talk is money.
Hey, he's a friend. Forget money. What's that?
I'm just asking.
money. When he gets some he'll pay you. Now he's got nothing.
debts up to here. - Can't talk to you.
we're just talking here.
quiet down. Who doesn't have money?
if he's got money, great.
otherwise, we'll eat a good couscous and that's that.
I'll shake on that. You said it.
I respect you. Really.
the city liked his project. - How do you know?
good news. - My cousin works sanitation.
I hope it's true.
for those people, as long as it isn't a mosque, the plan will go through.
you say a prayer.
Julia, come with me.
the vegetables in these 4 things.
there? - Yeah.
want to teach me to make fish?
I don't know. I never made it for 100 people.
well, at my sister's wedding.
about 30? - I don't know.
three.
four.
five.
still got the potatoes.
you sure about this? You made too much.
it's too much.
there's 100 people or more.
I think it's too much.
it's 35 pounds. That's 12 oz. A head.
it's a waste. - No.
for a wedding, it's 100, even 200 pounds.
for a wedding.
there will be leftovers.
there will be leftovers.
if there's any left, there's always the poor. Always got charity.
that's good.
God knows how many poor there are!
that'll keep the ain away from your family.
stop talking curses.
it's true.
what do you mean? - The ain exists.
you keep talking about it.
a car that breaks down, it's the evil eye.
a door slams - the evil eye. And that's not all.
always happens at the wrong time.
Majid! Majid!
Majid's not here.
it's not Karima.
it's not Olfa.
it's not logical. It must be the evil eye.
that's just life. Lots of illogical stuff happens at the wrong time.
right.
it's superstition.
who's calling?
Soussou? Soussou?
soraya. Soraya.
want to leave a message?
Souad, the evil eye exists, right?
I don't know. All I know is, a little charity is good.
I'll tell him.
you're both superstitious.
it's not superstition. This is different.
you're confused.
what do you call it?
the ain, whatever.
not superstition.
who was that?
it is superstition.
a wrong number.
wrong number?
I'm sick of that phone.
always ringing.
it's the ain.
even a phone call is the ain. See what I mean?
if that's not superstition, what is it?
finish the fish.
that's all.
let's get the fish done.
hurry up, night has fallen.
got to finish. - Almost done.
you're done? - Almost.
I'm done. Got the eyes out. - Come on, quick!
saha, that suit! - Thanks.
glad you're here.
what? - Come here.
what is it? - I'm having trouble.
the bow tie.
don't strangle me.
don't be a child.
stop moving.
there you go.
you look good!
you like it?
Yeah, it's class. No kidding around.
what else? What about you? Go get dressed!
I'm not going.
what do you mean?
she's not going. If she's not, I can't.
hurts deep.
I understand. You can't go if she doesn't.
and Slimane? Thought about him?
I know, but what can you do?
you know why he's doing all this?
it's for you, for his children.
it's not for himself.
he couldn't care less.
all that's behind us now.
we're old now.
we try to hang on, bust it a little more.
for you.
if it was only about us, a few olives and a hunk of bread would be plenty.
but when we see you, happy and all, that's fantastic for us.
we live again. You see?
solitude, exile, humiliation... All that's behind us.
we think at least we didn't, we aren't just...
we didn't immigrate for nothing.
see my point?
what can you say?
you know...
Slimane sees no difference between you and his daughters.
he doesn't, but do they?
they what?
they see a difference.
that's what you say.
they do. I know what I'm saying.
what did they do? - Nothing.
they never did anything to me!
some things don't lie.
sometimes it's in your head.
Slimane will be disappointed.
what can you do?
try to convince her. I know you.
she's hard-headed.
it's rough.
it'll be rough. - Try.
try to find the words. That's all I'm asking.
let's go. Pass me my cigarettes.
Kader's here.
how are you, handsome?
looking good.
getting married? - See that?
quit it. Don't start.
look at him, a real gentleman.
I'm always a gentleman. What do you think?
why don't they open?
we are not going to keep waiting like this...
lots of people!
thank you for the invitation.
how are you? - Fine, and you?
very nice place. - Thank you.
good luck.
how are you, Olfa? It's nice.
it's my father mostly. Like it?
lovely. - Very nicely done.
it's super. With those palms. Great.
Azza! Azza!
Azza! - Coming.
the childrers plate.
mind the bones for them. - I know.
that's the poor mars plate. - Whose?
a poor man. Go out and find someone. - No, it takes too long.
all the way into town. - Find someone outside.
no, I'm not going.
you go.
all right, I know you.
took the garbage out? - Yes.
get out of here. I'll manage.
go ahead, sit down.
you go over there.
Nadia, serve there.
I'm here?
some people haven't been served yet.
my daughter.
Oh, she's your daughter.
nice to meet you.
welcome. - Thank you.
should I seat them?
have a nice evening. - Thank you, see you later.
I put you at that table in the back.
Olfa! Olfa!
go get the couscous.
Majid! Majid!
mom!
what is it? What are you doing?
what's the matter, Mom? Come on, let's go.
please.
me, go there? That'll be the day.
come on. Why do you do this?
there's lots of people there.
come on, please.
what is it?
what is it?
tell me.
what is it? He had to put it there?
CoulDrt find another dock?
he wanted Quai de la Roublique.
think he wanted this crappy place?
that's all they'd give him.
it's just one evening. Then he's going.
you think it was to upset you? It was just chance.
to humiliate me.
humiliate you? He wouldn't.
stop thinking everyone's against you, that they wish you ill.
people don't just think about you.
you're a joke. Fuck, I swear.
we'll go bad if you keep this up.
disgusting.
people will say you got dumped.
fingers will point at us again.
when I think about that Souad. She's so annoying.
she'll get ideas again.
I heard the girls already. They said stuff.
it's just gossip.
that's why we should go. Or they'll get in Slimane's head.
they'll say, "Dad, only your children are here.
she's nothing. She's never there for you.
always moping, acting important.
she's never happy.
you'll see.
let them talk. Who cares?
right, cause Slimane doesn't care.
wait till he starts wondering.
how will that feel? Weird?
I don't care.
how can you let them? Why do you let them talk?
if I were you, frankly... Not just cause you're my mother, you're gorgeous. Young, pretty. You got it all.
in your place, to get them jealous,
I'd put a mean dress on, some make-up,
I'll brush out your hair. Put on some jewelry.
you go there, look them in the eye.
you walk in there, and you act like a star.
like a hypocrite.
you know how they act. Asking how you are, all that.
do the same. You don't care about anyone.
at least you'll screw them.
just do that. - No.
do it for real. Why not? You're not a woman?
fuck them. Just to get on their nerves.
show who you are.
you're gorgeous, compared to them.
no comparison. Night and day.
did you see her face?
all fat, doesn't know how to dress.
she's disgusting. She wears flea market stuff.
she disgusts me, really.
she's so ugly, with that hair.
you got nice hair.
all she can do is criticize people.
she wags her tongue and she can cook. That's it.
I'd rather be the gorgeous one than know how to cook. I mean it.
am I right?
everybody's expecting you. I saw Hamid, Kader.
they all asked for you.
and Slimane!
that really pains me.
he'll be crushed.
you go. - Crushed.
his kids will be happy as shit!
he'll be crushed.
you go, you earned it.
I won't go if you don't.
you invested in it.
no. I invested with the heart. I don't give a fuck about parties.
you don't go, I don't go.
you'll represent me. It's fine.
I won't. - It's the same thing.
no, it doesn't work like that.
the most important day of his life, you drop him like a dog.
what are you, ashamed of something?
he doesn't care.
he does so. He asked me before, if you were coming.
he did not.
I swear. He said, "Is she coming?
I said, don't worry, I'll try to convince her.
I shouldn't even tell you that.
you disgust me.
damn it!
there's lots of people.
shit.
we never go out.
I'm sick of being all cooped up.
you go.
go, you're not even dressed.
I go, then you say I ditched you. I know you.
come on, Rym.
enough.
it's no big deal.
it's nothing. You go. Me or you is the same.
so just go.
you'll have fun, get off my case.
you're so selfish.
it's disgusting. All you think of is yourself, and your shitty hotel.
what would it cost you? Will you die if you go?
explain it to me. What?
it's not for me to go, that's all.
disgusting.
that woman...
with all those people there.
everybody served?
you all right, Dad?
what's in this? - Tuna.
tuna.
those are Fatma's fingers.
Fatma's fingers.
not bad. - Yeah, it's good.
like egg rolls.
Hey, Mom.
going OK? - Yes.
how's the couscous?
the sauce, vegetables, fish, and the grain.
it's really good.
if this fish couscous catches on...
we've got worries.
unfortunately, we'll find out, in our restaurant business, we'll have less clientele. People will come here.
and I heard their pricing will be very, let's say, reasonable.
we wouldn't be able to do that sort of thing.
follow his lead.
stop, he's not from here.
I won't follow a guy who's not from around here.
got it? - Yeah.
it's heavy.
Riadh! Riadh!
come help us unload!
we're late.
well, let's have a toast.
Mr. Beji!
he's the owner? - Right.
do you know Mr. Dorner?
Yes, we met at City Hall.
a little hurriedly.
right.
Congratulations. It's lovely.
Mr. Dorner is deputy mayor.
future mayor!
no, deputy is hard enough.
a stepping stone!
I know what I'm saying.
say you don't want to.
it would be good.
municipal advisor, cultural affairs, owner of our largest vineyard.
which you manage admirably.
honorary member of the "Give A Net" Foundation, which is managed, just as admirably, by Madeleine Dorner.
Flattery!
whatever it takes.
get a grip.
you're melting on the ground.
speaking of humanitarians, Mr. Beji here is a fine example of merit and perseverance.
a fine human adventure.
exactly. A fine human adventure, I must say.
when you came that first day, with your daughter, or your friend's daughter, you had your plan in your head.
you knew what you wanted.
but you had nothing to invest in it.
a very thin application.
personally, I would not have bet on it.
but when I see the result, all the effort you put into it,
I am bowled over!
Congratulations.
to your success!
inch 'Allah, as they say.
that how you say it?
very hip, Madeleine!
how's my accent?
to your success!
I'm fucked.
seen Julia?
no.
you seen her or not? - I said no.
anybody asks, say I left. A friend got a flat on the highway.
what?
a friend is in trouble.
I'll be back in an hour or two, or three.
give them the message?
what a mess.
those shoes in the stairway!
hurting?
got it, Olfa?
look at those vegetables. - And I'm hungry.
I tasted it, it's good. - Waiting tables makes me hungry.
smell it.
she always cooked for us. Now it's for them.
we'll eat later.
I'm jealous.
look at that. I don't want to give them any.
they don't deserve it. - That's good mullet.
she said to broil it one more time.
she only pre-cooked it. So it wouldn't be crumbly.
I see.
wait for the last minute.
she said at the very last minute.
OK. I'll heat the sauce meanwhile.
Olfa, help me.
this will break my back.
careful.
one, two, up.
up!
you're crazy! - We spilled it!
my shoes! - I better clean it or it will stain.
my God.
and we're in a rush. That's all we needed.
I'm laughing my head off.
first second with the sauce!
try to keep the same height as me.
wait, let me help. - Naturally, if your side's higher...
we better clean up.
no big deal. It's nothing.
over there.
that's good.
we put it in the platters?
what a mess.
should we...? - Get the plates out.
I'll put this underneath.
we'll put it in the fridge.
let me wipe the table.
don't lean over too much.
or else we'll get absorbed by your breasts, too!
did you see when you were serving?
they were hungry! One calls me "darling" now!
Really? - Serious?
Yeah, he got brave. - For real?
for real! He was asking questions about Lilia's breasts.
he asked if they were real. - He did?
Yeah! I was dying. His wife was right there.
he was asking me, I swear.
you said they were.
I said maybe you're used to silicone, but those are real!
totally natural! - Right. That's how we are.
I'm telling you. Starting right in!
unbelievable.
and the grain? Do we heat it?
mom heated it enough. With the sauce, it'll be fine.
what do we put out? The couscous!
Where's the couscous?
look under the table. Riadh brought it down.
look underneath.
who got it? - Riadh.
these plates don't match.
did you put it in the fridge? No, can't be.
I mean it's grain. Although, with them...
look below.
do we mix it?
and we'll put sauce on each table.
Riadh! Riadh!
Riadh, come down!
come down, please.
thinks he's here for the music.
Where's the couscous pot? - The couscous pot?
over there. - Get it, we're serving!
find it, hurry up!
that's not it?
that's not couscous. Where is it?
what's that? - The sauce!
I brought everything down. - Apparently not! I looked.
that's the vegetables!
underneath? - Vegetables!
I got it all.
Riadh, you're in the way.
I brought it all down! - I got sauce, vegetables.
what's missing? - I got it all.
you must've left it up there. You left the couscous pot.
go get it, hurry up. Come on, we're ready here.
I put it all here, Karima.
then show me. Go ahead, I'm waiting.
I don't know.
go get it. There are people waiting.
go get it. Maybe you left it in the car.
people are waiting. - It's not here?
No! Stop looking for nothing.
want me to get angry? - Move over!
it's not here!
move it! You want me to yell?
you OK, girls?
fine. - Let's go.
I'm waiting for the grain.
it's not here.
I brought it all down.
that can't be.
what's going on? - I don't know.
I told him to look in the car, he just stands there.
did you get it from Mom's?
Yes, I'm sure of that. I put it in the back of the trunk.
the vegetables and sauce in front, and the mullet on the back seat.
I'm positive.
so go get it. Come on.
I'm talking to you.
wake up!
the car's not here.
Where's the car?
majid left. - Where'd he go?
on the highway. - What highway?
what highway?
he went to help a friend.
what friend? - He broke down.
he told you that?
I can't believe this.
what's going on?
he drove off with the grain.
shit.
call him, quick.
he left the grain in the car.
he went to help a friend who broke down on the highway.
what did he say exactly, Riadh?
no signal. Be right back.
he went to get his friend who had a flat.
what is this? Not again. Did you believe him?
I don't know.
how many times has he used that story?
unbelievable. Where did Majid go?
to help a friend who got a flat.
but the grain is in the car!
I don't know.
did he leave alone? Did you see?
where the fuck is he?
what is it with him?
he's a fucking moron!
you sure? You sure that grain was loaded in the car?
I trust Olfa. She said she got it from Mom's. Has to be true.
my mother wouldn't let them forget.
well?
voice mail. - There. See?
I knew it was bullshit.
I left a message. He must have shut it off.
I kept calling, same thing.
now what do we do?
sure you got the grain? - Positive.
I saw the couscous pot in the trunk. I know I did.
a couscous pot is enormous. It's pretty obvious.
you didn't see it?
you couldn't miss it.
why did Majid go? Where was he going?
how long to make another grain?
an hour, easy.
an hour? That's optimistic. There's 100 people.
a little longer.
much longer. - Longer.
he'll be back. He has to come back.
he'll see the grain is in the trunk.
call your mother, tell her to make more. I'm on my way.
are you serious? Make another one?
she'll scream. She'll go wild!
what can I do? You have another idea?
all we needed!
and call that idiot. That idiot Majid!
no use. He turned it off.
Doesrt even ring. Voice mail.
Olfa, call your mother. Your father's telling you.
here comes the couscous!
all those people waiting.
now my mother's going to yell.
they're going to fight.
she'll blame him, he'll blame her.
it's the ain.
get out of here.
turn the stove off. It's no use.
what now?
serve drinks.
I saw liquor there. Let's serve drinks.
only way.
what choice do we have? You know, alcohol is nourishing.
especially for the French.
give them drinks, they forget their wives. I know.
it's in the car? - We'll do it quick.
have you called him? - Voice mail.
what a fucking idiot!
Hello, Latifa.
how are you?
Thanks.
Karima, we've got people here.
change these glasses? - No problem.
welcome. - Thanks.
you both look gorgeous. My father will be happy.
that's nice.
how are you? - Fine, and you?
good. Pretty good right now.
we're a little... It's crowded, but we can handle it.
it's beautiful.
you like it? - Great.
that's Slimane.
where is he?
he had to go run an errand. Wort be long. We're waiting.
not long.
Where's your mom?
my mother's not coming.
she's discreet. She doesn't like big crowds.
too bad.
must be tired.
right. I mean, she did it all, from start to finish.
now it's our turn. It's up to us.
want help?
if I need you, I'll let you know.
you're part of our party, so let's find you a spot.
Riadh, want to seat them? I got stuff to take care of.
see you later.
bitches, I can't stand them.
you see her strut? She thinks she's the bride.
really.
Lilia, I swear...
it's nothing.
who's that?
your dad's friend and his daughter.
that's the daughter?
like his daughter.
that's insulting to Mom.
Olfa, please.
they're embarrassing us.
want to go against your father? That's all!
they're here, it's done. - Keep serving.
think of your father.
don't give them the satisfaction.
take a bottle and serve. And smile.
smile, Olfa.
Hi, some date liqueur?
the grairs in the trunk. - What?
he left with the grain.
shit.
you know where he is?
my father went looking for him.
shit.
they said it's ready.
they're heating it up now, ma'am.
they want fig liqueur.
Beji comes to see me.
for one night.
we're not animals.
give him a shot.
he won't leave.
put a wolf in the henouse, he stays.
I completely agree. Completely.
it's not something that can last. It can't hold.
this structure can't hold up.
let's be honest.
if in 3 months it doesn't work, it's his problem.
he needs a permanent spot.
we can't give him permanent. Only temporary spots.
authorizations for one to three days.
you know those guys like I do.
if he gets the permits he needs in 3 days, we'll find him a place near the station, no problem.
less heat on it. We can put him there easy.
preference always goes to any commercial boat.
you know that very well.
in four days, the Belem puts in.
the Belem is docking in this spot.
that boat in, they clear out. Nothing to be done.
everything all right?
is my wife here? - No.
what is it?
what?
did something happen to Souad?
something happen to my wife?
talk!
talk!
Julia called me this morning at the yard.
she said, "Come quick." I find her like this.
today, she was at your wife's house, helping with the couscous.
again, some tramp calls Majid to make a date.
which means... - Julia picked up the phone.
majid gets calls at his family's house.
calls from his mistresses, he takes them at Souad's.
she's encouraging him to do this, protecting him.
she takes their numbers. She knows her!
his sisters know. Riadh, too. You, too! Everyone!
what am I?
is that a family man?
never there for his kid.
constant yelling and problems. She knows it!
your Souad downstairs knows. And she acts like it's nothing.
I'm the one who has to swallow my pride.
now you've trampled me. What am I?
I'm a piece of shit.
Souad... I'm not surprised.
I don't know what she has against me. I'm not surprised.
but your daughter. Karima comes here...
they don't respect Julia.
hang on, calm things down, instead of inflaming.
I'm not inflaming.
all day long,
I clean house, waiting for my husband like an idiot!
she's always like this.
he tells me he's got to work late.
even she... she threw him out...
she said he... At six in the morning, as usual!
know what time he gets home? When I'm asleep!
you're not breathing. Calm down.
the kid.
I have to shut up, go down and say, "Yeah, I'm fine.
Souad talks to the neighbor, with her big mouth.
she says it's me. That I make no effort, never go out.
like I'm the problem? It's never him.
Never!
you never look at yourselves?
easy. The kid's here. Easy.
the kid's used to it!
it's not me. I'm a human being.
I can't take it! - We'll leave, that's all.
how many Sundays downstairs going, "And how are you?
Yeah, I'm fine.
it's not fine! I can't be like you.
I'm not a hypocrite. - He's a momma's boy.
you know Majid. You know how he is.
you know what your son is like?
he's not a man. He's a madman.
he's not a father to his child.
he never sees him. My child never sees his father.
when he sees his kid, he's drunk!
and he's not a husband. And not a friend either.
he's a stranger when he comes here.
and I have to shut up because he pays the bills.
the so-called man of the house.
he's got the money.
I'm not a whore. I am not a whore, see?
I have a kid to raise. I have a home.
I need love, I need respect.
that's not family.
what is that?
he's a father, he's never there.
that whore who called is across the way!
he's all over town.
she sees me. She must laugh when she sees me suffer.
alone, in front of the TV.
like a poor wretch. Like I'm useless.
you're downstairs. And there's talk, talk.
you don't like us. You wouldn't do this if you...
if Souad had any self-respect...
calm down, Julia.
how can I calm down? How?
with this stuff?
is that right? That my husband's mistress knows my sister-in-law, and my other sister-in-law?
and my mother-in-law? Calls her up?
she calls her house!
she takes messages, helps him cheat!
every time he does it, working late, home at 6, he's with that whore!
I see her at her window!
I won't calm down. I can't.
of course I'm yelling! What the fuck else?
it's been eating at me!
but that's it. Now it's...
you know. This couscous, your project, I thought it would help a little,
I thought I was part of the family.
I really thought so, but I was wrong.
all that for your party, and now look.
I was with you.
but now, forget it. I'm out of the family.
look at the kid, might be your last. You'll see.
look at him. You'll see.
breathe.
it's not a life for a kid.
I don't drink turpentine.
I only drink champagne.
it's coming, don't worry.
I can't resist a little champagne.
DiDrt drink the boura?
slight delay"! We've been waiting all this time.
so long. - Your business is starting badly.
be right back.
stop smoking! For your health!
stop!
run! Come catch us!
come on, run!
look, he's running.
he looks like a marionette.
he's going 2 MPH. Get some Gatorade!
you hit the accelerator. You're gonna kill him.
children!
that's enough now!
I'm not in your shoes. - I understand, and I'm sorry.
I've come once, but I won't be back. I guarantee it.
I'll never eat couscous again, ever!
don't say that.
give me some explanation.
I told you. The fish came late. The trawlers came back late.
Where'd it come from? - From the boats. It's fresh.
the boat was late. - That's not right.
you should have changed the time.
why not invite us an hour later?
we just found out!
I was told 9, I get here at 9. And I'm waiting.
I know, I'm sorry.
easy to be sorry.
it's going to get sticky.
on opening night, making us wait two hours for a fish couscous.
she knows what's going on back there.
it's too long. - Really too long.
bad weather.
intimate ambiance.
good evening.
what a surprise.
where were you? I've been looking all over.
I changed places.
what have you brought me?
couscous.
havert had any in a long time.
it looks delicious. - Eat while it's hot.
thank you.

once you have them, the only evidence you see is the evidence that reinforces your gut feeling.
human nature. -- There's no money left in his wallet and there's been a series of robberies here the last two months.
you have some reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years honing his ability to sense danger to notice anything outside of the ordinary...
so for some average street criminal to get the drop on him. --yeah, it raises questions.
not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a 45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.
any homicide cop will tell you that sort of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.
anyone want anything to eat or drink?
uh, no, thanks, ma'am. I think we're fine. -- Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for dinner. I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.
you sure? You've been on as long as me.
you gonna make me change my mind? -- [Chuckles]
detective, take a look at the bullet mark on the doorjamb. The slug didn't penetrate.
it's cedar, which is a soft wood. It gets brittle with age.
so what are you sayin'? -- Bad guy used a silencer. That's why nobody heard it.
and that's what slowed down the velocity of the bullet and stopped it from penetrating the wood which it easily would have done had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
the shooter was standing right here.
one other thing, Detective.
excuse me. Agent Merriweather's firearm the safety's still on.
we assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
agent Marin, why don't you explain to the detectives why that is unlikely.
if he was a police officer, it would make sense because your academy trains you to draw your weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions to avoid accidental shootings.
our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
if he managed to draw his weapon, his safety should have been off.
Aprotective Agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
when we draw our weapon, we intend to use it.
bottom line Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon. I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.
if this man was one of yours, you would have treated him with a lot more respect.
let's get a gurney up here!
it always amazes me how thorough you are.
well, we try to do the best job we can.
hopefully you sleep better at night.
and I definitely do. -- Garrison, DiPaola. We're good on the perimeter.
I'm 10-60. - Uh, roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early, so, uh, he can get something to eat.
Hi. -- Hi.
you all right?
I missed you. I missed you so much.
just a second. -- Okay.
this is outstanding. -- There you go. And enjoy.
I love you, Sarah.
[Radio Beeps] - Garrison, DiPaola. Where are you?
garrison, DiPaola, where are you? -- Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi. So what the hell is going on, or...
aziz, what are you doin' here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
he -- He was murdered?
P.I.D. thinks it might be connected to work.
director put us on alert.
I'm sorry. I know he was your friend.
was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
was he agitated or worried about anything?
he was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
did he tell you why? -- He just said he had a couple of tough days at work.
What'd he say at breakfast? -- Some gossip. Uh, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for you but I need a complete picture if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
he told me that he thought Pete Garrison was having an affair with someone's wife at work.
just gossip. It just -- Yeah.
probably not even true.
look, that's all we need for now.
you got the lead on Charlie's murder? -- Screw you.
what? -- Screw you.
you still got a problem with me? -- Take your hands off of me.
Christ. It doesn't matter what I say to you.
I don't care if you got a problem with me but you show respect when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
if you have information that can help me, that I want to hear.
otherwise, stay out of my way. -- Fine. You're a piece of work.
you know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work. You have any idea what that might be?
no. -- Then if you figure it out, you know where to find me.
Yeah, good. I'll send you a memo. -- Do that.
Hey. Is everything okay? -- Hey, Jill. Yeah.
you workin' with him now? -- Yeah.
keep your eyes open. You may learn a lot but don't listen to everything he's got to say.
especially about me. -- Okay.
Pete.
there some problem between you two?
I thought you were friends. -- We were.
so what happened? -- It's personal.
let's go.
no. He can go to hell. I don't want to talk to him. -- Just tell him it wasn't me.
it wasn't anybody. -- I'm not saying it was.
I wasn't having an affair! -- Cindy, I know you weren't.
what do you want me to tell him I haven't already told him 30 times? This is why I left him.
he's the most pigheaded man I've ever met.
you still love him, don't you?
Hey, Pete. Pete. -- Hey, Tom.
you know a guy named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure. He's a snitch I used to use when I was working in counterfeiting.
okay. Just fielded a call from this guy.
I told him you weren't running informants anymore offered to transfer the call to W.F.O.P.I.D.
he said you're the only person he'd talk to. -- Thanks.
there he is! Publishers Clearing House, my man! You got somethin'for me?
[Laughs] Did you fill yours out yet?
every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out. I never do.
long time no see, Walter. What's up?
let's walk.
you got some info on that Charlie Merriweather murder?
that Agent who was killed outside his house on Monday? -- Yeah.
maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
what was that something? -- A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know, it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
not if you got somebody inside.
you saying there's a mole in the Secret Service?
that's right.
there's an Agent who wants to help assassinate the president? -- That's right.
well, what's his name? -- I don't know. I just know he exists.
well, how? Who --Who's giving you the information?
I want one million dollars. -- What are you smoking, Walter?
now be serious. -- I'm dead serious.
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
they'll hunt me down. -- We'll put you in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day. Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.
you get me the money, and I will disappear. -- I gotta be honest with you.
I find it pretty far-fetched we got Agents in on an assassination attempt.
here. Maybe this will change your mind, okay?
call signs, code words, today's encryption keys!
Yeah, whoever this traitor is they're either on the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
listen, I want a list of everyone who's got "Q" clearance.
and where's the president right now?
press conference at his house. Twenty minutes.
this morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve to take on the infrastructure of terrorism to take on the infrastructure of terrorism.
how reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
against who? -- Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.
sir. That's everyone with "Q" clearance.
[Ballentine] Those who actually commit terrorist acts.
now let me point out, this is very important polygraph everyone on that list and stand up a red team to find the traitor.
now, I'm going to assume that the hit on Merriweather is connected to this so let's fold that investigation in as well.
and we put Breckinridge in charge of the whole thing. -- He's the best we've got?
Yeah. -- Pete. He's kind of a protege of yours. What do you think?
he'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him. -- Then he's the guy.
you can have anybody you want.
from I.D. from the field. You get carte blanche.
not right now. -- Oh, sorry.
I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie. -- No, I'm gonna keep her.
she hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
[Man] I will blow you up. I come to bomb this country.
[Indistinct] Holy wars.
we have intel that representatives of Al-Qaeda have met on at least two occasions with the Barranquilla leadership.
you think it's timed to coincide with the Camp David talks?
probably. The threat alone interferes with the process.
we pulled 50 agents in from the field.
people who haven't worked at the White House in at least two cycles.
they'll integrate with both of your teams.
we're all gonna be looking over each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
well, do what you have to to protect me, but I want the threat the investigation, I want everything kept classified.
as far as the public is concerned, I'm just carrying on my normal business.
is that clear? -- Mr. President we're going to need to get everyone involved here.
what do you think would happen to the power of the president if people thought I wasn't even safe from my own Secret Service?
it took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency and I'm not gonna undermine it with something like this.
let's circle the wagons, okay? You all right? -- Fine.
good, let's do that. How do we proceed?
bill, you're the guy.
you're the last line of defense.
you can protect him better than any of us can.
is there anything else that you can think of that'll help you do that?
Yeah. -- [Coins Jingling]
this.
[Ballentine] And I promise you, right here and now, we're gonna win this one.
you can bank on it. Thank you very much. Good night.
good night. Thank you.
heads it's Sixth Street, tails it's Eighth.
Bravo cars.
this way, Mr. President. -- Thank you, Bill.
classic is moving to bravo cars.
[Woman Over Radio] Copy that. Command to alpha cars. You are off the hook.
sir, could you put down that knife?
it's not what they wanted to hear. It's what they needed to hear.
Hello, young lady.
Where'd this guy come from?
he's an old C.I. Of Garrison's. Nine, 10 years.
garrison? -- Mm-hmm.
what's wrong?
it's nothing.
are you sure? -- Yes. It's okay.
how do I find Xavier? -- Um, I don't know where he lives.
he's a fanatic about not being followed. -- You ever tried?
what? - Have you ever tried?
he wants a million bucks from us, Dave. I'm sure he'll contact us.
you better be right.
you get in touch with us as soon as you find him.
could be any one of them. It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?
what percentage of your people have had a polygraph? -- A little over half.
over half? The president's life is at stake.
heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5: 00 PM this afternoon or don't show up for work tomorrow.
were you born in Morocco? -- No.
do you live in Bethesda? -- No.
[Woman] Were you born in Alabama? -- No.
[Man] Have you ever had contact with child pornography?
uh, yes. I was involved with an investigation with the bureau...
just yes or no answers, please. -- Okay, Stan. Yes.
are you up? The witch hunt is on.
get your polygraph today.
how did they get these?
night-vision camera on a boat stabilized by a gyroscope.
pretty sophisticated.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
it's gotta be someone inside the Service.
somebody could have picked it up. They're good. That's what they do.
who?
the same Agent plotting to killJohn? Who?
141 years there's never been a traitor in the Secret Service.
now, all of a sudden, there's two? I don't buy that.
somehow they're connected.
maybe this is the assassination?
this is a death sentence for John, a political death sentence.
that's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Sarah, I promise.
let's get this goddamn witch hunt over with.
just relax. -- I'm relaxed.
were you divorced in 1998? -- No.
have you received adequate training for your profession? --No.
but I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express.
have you ever violated Secret Service protocol in the past 30 days?
no.
have you done anything in the past 30 days to violate Secret Service protocol? -- No.
are you involved in a plot to kill the president of the United States?
[All] No.
I could use a few of those.
Thanks. -- You look exhausted, Bill.
you look worse. -- [Chuckles]
I haven't slept since we went on alert.
well, I'm back on. It's worse than going to confession.
have you done your polygraph yet?
you know I can't even let you back on duty unless -- Yeah, I'll go now.
[Woman] Is your name Peter Garrison? -- Yes.
are you involved in a plot to kill the president? -- No.
were you divorced in 1998? -- Yes.
have you violated Secret Service protocols in the last 30 days?
no.
have you done anything to endanger the life of our president in the last six months?
not that I know of. - Yes or no answers, please.
no. No.
welcome to Mayflower Hotel.
[Camera Shutter Clicks] -- Mayflower Hotel, can I help you? Just a moment, sir.
are you Mr. Garrison? -- Yes.
you have a phone call. You can take it here.
thank you. -- [Man] Walk three blocks east on Massachusetts Avenue.
take a left on 12th Street. Las Palmas Coffee Shop. -- All right.
[Woman On P.A.] Now boarding on track 4, 12: 13 Acela Express with stops in Philadelphia, New York, Boston.

the gun is going down! -- All right. Back up now. Back up.
turn around!
what the hell were you doin' at Las Palmas? -- Havin' a goddamn cup of coffee.
what the hell's goin' on here? Is that one of your Agents I'm following?
sorry for the crossover.
Pete! I called four times. Where the hell have you been?
we're not out of here till tomorrow.
the president decided they should arrive at the summit together. Where were you?
Oh! Excuse me.
Oh, here we are. Now, Kate, this is your weekend to catch the trout.
I don't like worms. -- No, no. This is fly-fishing.
Pete, can I talk to you a minute?
Yes, sir.
we're really, both of us in uncharted territory here, aren't we?
an assassin inside the Secret Service?
inside my detail?
now, Bill's been briefing me, of course, but this guy's your informant, right?
Yes, sir. -- I want to get some of this firsthand so let's make time at Camp David to do that, all right?
Yes, sir.
good afternoon, Mr. President.
good afternoon. I'll see you at dinner.
so, Karen, how do things stand? -- It's time for you to weigh in.
can I get you in there now for a few hours? -- Absolutely.
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea. If you could stop by, it would be great.
sure. -- Tom, we're gonna walk it.
what's going on, Pete? Why don't they just tell us what they want?
it's okay. It's gonna be fine. - Nothing about this feels okay or fine or... It will be. -- Has that guy called you?
what's his name? What's that guy's name? -- Xavier.
has he called you? -- Not yet. No.
Katie, hi. -- Good afternoon, ma'am.
Hi. -- Would you care for tea?
it's such a beautiful day. Why don't we have tea outside?
well, that's a great idea. How was your flight? -- Short.
[Teddy] You guys all decent? -- Afraid so.
your informant's on the phone.
[Xavier] Do you got the money? -- [Pete] I got $100, 000 in cash and a legal document guaranteeing you the rest once the traitor's apprehended.
Yeah, right. -- Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.
I'm not gonna start now. Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.
[Xavier Chuckles] Allenwood Mall food court at 11: 00 AM.
and don't try to bring nobody. I'll walk if I spot 'em.
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.
drive fast. -- Okay, you heard him. Let's go.
Breckinridge and Marin are already on the way. -- All right.
get the money bag and a car ready, please. -- Okay. Got it.
he knows we're following him. He went where he can mix up with a crowd.
there's no way we get surveillance in there.
hold it. There's no way I'm gonna let you go without a backup. No.
Chaminski. Chaminski goes with you. -- Let's go.
at your 1: 00.
[Man Over Radio] Watch your 3: 00. Watch your 3: 00.
check your 9: 00.
check your 9: 00! Check your 9: 00! Check your 9: 00!
get down! Secret Service! Get down!
shots fired. Shots fired. Agent down.
[Breckinridge Over Radio] Copy that. Breckinridge to Command.
we need backup at the Allenwood Mall. Agent down.
the shooter has blond hair, dark jacket. He's on the lower level.
[Woman Over Radio] Command, copy that. Available units en route. E.T.A. 20 minutes.
they're shooting. They're right behind the doors.
heads.
Pete, we're at the north end of the mall. Lower level.
I'm a hundred yards south of you.
Unholster your weapon. Keep it down.
work your way towards me. -- Copy that. Stagger off 10 feet.
get out of here!
take the point.
I don't have a visual!
go!
[Woman Over Radio] Garrison, Washington Command.
additional agents and medical assist are en route. Break. All units, be advised.
shots fired, Allenwood Mall. One Agent is down. There are multiple civilian casualties.
Pete. Pete!
you okay?
do you have any idea why your informant wanted to have you killed?
no. I'm wondering the same thing.
you might want to figure that one out, Pete.
[Carl] Pete!
presidential helicopter just went down.
[Woman Over TV] This is a news center special report.
the presidential helicopter, Marine One, has crashed.
[Man Over TV] Marine One, the presidential helicopter has gone down.
whether or not the president was on board has not...
marine One, the presidential helicopter has crashed.
it happened just moments ago about a half mile south of Camp David.
the chopper went down in some densely wooded...
[Man Over TV] We're now hearing reports the president was not on board.
actually, we can now confirm that neither the president or the first lady were on board at the time of the crash.
the president and first lady are safe.
if you'rejustjoining us, these are live pictures just outside Camp David where earlier today, Marine One... -- [Speaking Foreign Language]
went down shortly after take off.
two hikers who witnessed the crash reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail just before that helicopter went down.
that is leading to the possibility, unconfirmed by authorities...
our friend was insufficiently motivated. -- That the chopper was shot down probably by a shoulder-fired missile.
now, we want to make clear, again that the president and first lady are safe. -- [Foreign Language]
[Woman] If you arejustjoining us, these are live pictures from the scene just outside of Camp David, where earlier today Marine One went down just after take off.
sources say marine and Secret Service personnel were on that aircraft and they were killed in the crash.
this crash is being investigated by both the White House and the military.
you failed. -- [Man] I did exactly what I promised.
he wasn't on board.
that is the only thing that matters. That is the only thing I give a shit a...
do you understand?
now, we're gonna meet and we're gonna discuss this.
[Man] Deadly against any low-altitude aircraft including jets, prop planes and helicopters.
but that comes from witnesses.
has not been confirmed by investigators. -- [Knocking]
again, these pictures coming to us about -- [Shuts TV Off]
well, it sure doesn't look like you're here to bury the hatchet.
you're being investigated for treason.
what are you talk -- Step back.
excuse me? -- Step back.
Hey, Jill. -- Pete.
Matt. -- Pete.
sorry for the intrusion, sir.
if I failed the polygraph, then why am I still on duty?
director didn't want to arrest one of the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life without a little more evidence.
how long you been working for the Barranquilla Cartel?
what are you talking about?
[Door Opens] -- Hugo, can you come in here, please?
Pete Garrison, Special Agent Ortega with the F.B.I.
what were you doing at the Las Palmas Coffee Shop?
I was having a cup of coffee. -- Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop. Is there a problem with that?
Tom DiPaola said he called you four times. You never returned any of his messages.
and that you almost missed the Marine One flight yesterday.
they moved the flight up two hours. I was in the coffee shop.
it was noisy. I couldn't hear my cell phone.
now, wh-wh-what is this? What the hell are you doing following me?
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop for the Barranquilla Cartel.
[Breckinridge] You screwed up, Pete. You walked into a stakeout.
I wanna know your number one go-to guy at the cartel.
and I wanna know how you were gonna help them kill the president.
why would I want to kill the president? What motive do I have?
to be honest with you, I don't care. I know what the evidence is telling me.
I have given my entire life to the Secret Service.
I've gotten up at 4: 00 AM. Every goddamn morning. -- Is that what this is about?
you're bitter after all your years of service that they didn't make you director?
come on, Pete. Think about it. People would understand that.
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet for the president of the United States.
and in the 25 years since, you haven't even made shift supervisor on a presidential detail, and that I know you wanted.
but they don't put guys that bend the rules, not even a little bit in charge of P. P.D. do they?
even if they did take a bullet for the old man.
is that your professional or personal opinion?
I think this whole thing is getting personal. -- We got you nailed to the wall.
I didn't have an affair with Cindy. -- Has nothing to do with Cindy.
you can't accept that. -- We are not talking about that!
we're talking about it all the time, even when we're not talking about it!
you can't look at me without thinking about it!
Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip. -- I got a grip.
you think I wrecked your marriage, and it has completely clouded your judgment.
I am following the evidence and it is overwhelming.
the polygraph. Las Palmas Coffee Shop. You had unfettered access to Marine One.
it was hit by a missile for Christ's sake!
that's O'Brien in the motorized gurney heading for class last week.
he had polio when he was six years old.
the disease left his body crippled, but his mind remained sharp and alert.
and since he wanted to be a writer...
mark O'Brien entered Cal to major in English and learn his trade.
he wrote this poem for us about school here and about graduation.
graduation.
today I hear the crowd's applause
receive congratulations from my friends
today I ask if I've found a place among the rest
who studied, read, wrote
and passed the test in cap and gown.
today I hope you see a man upon this stage.

breathing.
look, you
this most excellent canopy, the air presses down upon me at fifteen pounds per square inch
a dense, heavy, blue glowing ocean
teasing me with its nearness and immensity
and all I get is a thin stream of it
a finger's width of the rope that ties me to life
shit.
okay, just focus.
scratch with your mind.
okay, your mind.
scratch with your mind.
good morning.
good morning.
you're late.
Joan.
I swear this was one crazy bitch
who'd swing me about enough to scare me
but careful enough so she could say:
now what was all the yelling about?
you polios are screamers. Always were.
I didn't say a word.
I typed my skinny novel in my head
and thought about revenge.
would you mind if I asked you a favor?
what, you need help moving furniture?
I need an advance on my pay.
like, two weeks.
now, that's not exactly asking too much, is it?
what if you don't last another two weeks?
it was a real drag that I was no longer allowed to use my other gurney.
the self-propelled one.
it had caused a couple of spectacular accidents.
basically, in spite of all the mirrors, I couldn't see where I was going.
Mary's fear and apprehension slowly gave way to pride and purpose.
Elizabeth, pregnant herself with Saint John , felt the power of this wondrous woman.
it was Elizabeth, and her absolute faith that gave Mary the courage she was lacking.
and she gave thanks, saying, my soul doth magnify the Lord...
and my spirit hath rejoiced in God, my savior.
may the spirit of the Lord be amongst you and remain with you always.
Amen.
I'm definitely a true believer, but I believe in a God with a sense of humor.
a wicked sense of humor.
one who created me in his own image.
hello. I don't think we've met.
I'm Father Brendan.
I'm Mark O'Brien.
I knew Father Seamus very well.
I'm sorry that he's not here any more.
as are many others. I'll do my best to fill his shoes.
you'd like me to hear your confession?
Yes, I would.
I told my attendant to come back in half an hour. Is that okay?
I'm in no rush. - I can be a bit time-consuming...
but I'm worth the trouble.
I'm here for you, Mark.
okay.
this is not exactly a confession. I haven't yet done the deed.
I was sort of hoping to get a quote in advance.
what's on your mind?
the most immediate thing on my mind would be one of my attendants.
Joan.
I'm thinking of getting rid of her.
it's an evil thought, but I can't help it. - Is she dishonest?
or incompetent? - No. Neither of those.
she looks at me the wrong way.
it's that "You need me more than I need you" look.
I'd like to show her she's wrong just for the evil satisfaction it will give me.
is that a sin, Father?
well, it obviously troubles you.
Yeah, it troubles me a lot, because what if it's really just a power trip?
you know? Yeah, me against her?
me against the world? - I really wouldn't worry about that.
the question is whether you like having her around.
I can't stand her. - Well, then get rid of her.
if I were in a position to choose, I'd find someone nice.
even if it was a power trip.
then I have your blessing to fire her?
unofficially, yes.
that's good enough for me.
Hey! Ha!
Amanda.
Amanda would have been a pretty girl
to touch, to hold, to kiss.
do you have any experience?
no. None at all.
that sounds perfect.
so how long can you stay out?
three or four hours. - Yeah?
depends on how much fun I'm having.
as she glided through crowds of lives she couldn't leave me lying there dried-out bubble gum stuck on the underneath of existence.
she took me on a picnic once with her boyfriend and another couple.
lust crackled in the air.
and what did the boyfriend think?
that I was in his way?
I'm always in somebody's way, I thought.
the sun in my eyes.
And?
and what?
and do you touch him? - What do you...? Yeah.
I do everything.
do you have other questions?
gross. - What?
What'd you say?
okay, look, no need to be defensive, okay? I'm not exactly threatened by this guy.
yeah? Why not?
God, he's much more a man than you are.
so, what does your boyfriend think of me?
he's an asshole. Doesn't matter what he thinks of you.
I'm interested in the opinion of an asshole.
he thinks that you are some kind of Svengali and that you're gonna hypnotize me into your cult.
he's right.
he says he can already see changes.
her perfect, pale skin...
her Tudor court face...
her strong, fleshy legs drove me to ecstasies of despair.
want me to do that?
all I wished for were hands that moved...
just to touch her.
that would have been enough.
so with a gentle, fearless heart she took me in.
I thrived in her garden and wanted more.
okay.
shirts, shirts, shirts.
Oh.
this you must have.
what? What is it?
I love you.
um...
did she reciprocate your feelings?
she didn't seem to.
sometimes people can be very shy about their emotions.
well, in case she didn't get it the first time...
I told her again that I was in love with her and I wanted to marry her.
thinking it might swing things. - Did it?
Yeah.
she left.
Amanda could have been a pretty girl...
to touch, to hold, to take to bed.
I wish I knew what to say to you.
welcome to the human race.
every day, somebody breaks somebody else's heart.
and as I said, I'm here for you.
I just wish I had something more useful to offer.
all I have are these vague ideas about life and death...
that we priests are equipped with.
have you considered sharing your feelings with a therapist?
not really.
father? - Yeah?
I think I need a hug.
a hug?
Yeah.
there you go.
Hi. Vera? - Yes.
Oh, hi, I'm Rod. Hi.
I... I usually do 4 to midnights...
but we could switch if necessary.
have you had any experience?
some.
would you get that, please?
hello.
it's Sandy from Pacific News Service.
could you press that button and put it on speakerphone, please?
Hi, Sandy. - Hi, Mark. How you doing?
I'm good.
I have a new attendant. She answered the phone.
her name's Vera. - Welcome, Vera.
thank you. - Mark, we're doing a series of articles that I think might interest you.
the subject is sex and the disabled.
it would involve interviewing people in the Berkeley area.
but why now?
because we've got the money now.
but if you're working on something else, then we can talk about it later.
no.
now is fine.
great.
there was no escaping it.
a door had opened that I could not close.
and in invisible writing, it said, "Do not enter.
most positions like that one are pretty much impossible.
I don't know if you can quite visualize it, but it's called a lateral or a sideways reverse cowgirl.
it's okay. It's just a question of depth of penetration for most people.
like my partner, for instance. It doesn't really matter to me.
I mean, I get just as excited when he licks my nipples.
when he bothers to do that.
I think your tape's run out.
Oh. Oh.
do you want to continue?
uh...
that's okay, Carmen.
I think I've actually got enough to work on.
Thanks. - Well, give me a call if you need anything.
let me get you Greg's number. He's full of things you wouldn't believe were possible.
oral sex is a matter of taste.
and one thing that really works in my favor is that I smoke so much weed that my taste buds are pretty jaded.
this gives me a great deal of stamina in the tongue department.
and stamina is key in cunnilingus.
who are these people?
I feel like an anthropologist interviewing a tribe of headhunters.
Hi.
it's good to see you. How are things?
well... - Sorry.
things are a little confusing at the moment.
I would appreciate your advice as a friend, if you know what I mean.
sure. And I understand what you mean.
you remember at one point you suggested I might see a therapist?
Yes. Well...
one way or another, it's a long story, I ended up seeing a therapist.
a particular sort of therapist.
a sex therapist.
good morning, UC Berkeley. - May I please speak to someone in the Center for Sexuality and Disability, please?
I'm sorry, sir. The Center for Sexuality and Disability has been shut down.
thank God. - Sir?
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
it's no bother.
Oh, sir, before you go, I can give you a phone number for one of the therapists who used to work there.
would you like that?
it's not gonna fit. - It's fine.
we got you. Everything's just fine. - I don't like this. Let's forget it.
do you want to see this woman or not? - No!
Oops. Too late. - What floor?
eighteenth floor.
so...
what sort of chance do you give me?
of achieving your romantic fantasy?
very small to minute.
Oh, look, you don't have to pull any punches. You can be direct with me.
mark, I'm just a humble sex therapist.
I try to help people with sex problems that can be addressed.
your problem, I understand, is that you've never had sex.
that's correct.
would I be correct in assuming you're unable to masturbate?
correct. - Has anyone done it for you?
no. - Have you ever asked anyone?
not specifically.
I asked someone to marry me once. She declined.
does that come close to masturbation?
you know, being with the person you love is not the only way of expressing yourself sexually.
there are people called sex surrogates.
my penis speaks to me, Father Brendan.
sometimes I ejaculate during a bed bath in front of my attendants.
all I feel is shame and mortification while other men apparently get pleasure. I...
I'm sorry if I sound angry.
don't worry about it. Go on.
this therapist suggested I could work with a sexual specialist.
have sex with a person known as a sex surrogate who would be sensitive to my unusual needs.
what do you mean, "have sex"? - Well, when a man and a woman love each other very much... - No, I understand what it...
are we talking about sexual intercourse?
I think so. - Outside marriage?
I did do my best on the question of marriage.
what's the difference between this sexual specialist...
and a common prostitute?
I don't know, but I think there's a difference.
how old are you? - Thirty-eight.
why exactly now?
I never had any cash before, that's a major factor.
and I'm probably getting close to my use-by date.
and this is what you wanted my advice on? Fornication.
your advice as a friend.
do I have the deciding vote, so to speak?
well, let's just say I value your advice just as much as I do the therapist's.
you're serious about this?
I think sex is a serious matter.
it's one of the most persistent themes in the Bible.
so...
is it possible for me to know a woman in the Biblical sense, so to speak?
and...
and do I want to find out?
you want my opinion?
please.
in my heart, I feel like he'll give you a free pass on this one.
go for it. - Huh?
go for it.
Really? - Yes.
if you feel up to it. Do you feel up to it?
to tell you the truth...
I'm scared.
well, then, we should pray.
sweet Jesus...
mark and I sit at your feet...
and pray that you bless this little journey.
this one small step for a man.
I really feel proud of myself.
imposing on someone I hardly know to fornicate in their home.
get over it.
it's perfectly normal.
Ta-da! - Wow.
there are all sorts of useful things in that drawer over there if you guys feel like exploring.
Oh, that's okay. I'll bring my own sheets and towels.
no, everything will be provided.
I'm really honored that you asked me. It'll be great karma for the house.
great karma for the house?
my God, the pressure already.
I can't stand it.
Hey. It's Tony.
Hi. This is Laura White.
is Cheryl in, please?
Cheryl. - What is it?
phone.
she's coming.
I'm not your girlfriend. When someone calls...
particularly someone you don't know, you can use the word "Mom.
hello. This is Cheryl. - Hi. It's Laura.
haven't heard from you for a while. How are you?
pretty well. Look, I called to ask how you would feel about working with a severely disabled client.
I'm f...
can you hold on one second?
hey...
get a glass.
hello. Mark O'Brien's phone.
Hi, this is Cheryl Cohen Greene. May I speak to Mark?
uh, uh... Yeah, could you hold a second?
what? What am I doing here? Yes or no?
come on, make up your mind.
okay.
Yeah. Go ahead.
hello. This is Mark.
Hi, Mark. This is Cheryl.
Laura called to introduce you. I understand you'd like to meet. Is that right?
uh...
Yes.
I could see you on the thirteenth at 11: 00.
would that be any good for you?
Oh. Uh...
Yes, I think that would be fine for me.
where are you from?
Boston. You?
Salem. Small world. - Oh.
we'll talk for a while to begin with, and when you're ready...
we'll start doing some body-awareness exercises.
holy Mother of God.
what are body-awareness exercises?
which one? - Doesn't matter.
will you stop acting like you're going to your own execution?
I'm not acting.
okay, the purple one.
just try and think about something else.
baseball, for example.
that's what they usually tell boys to do. - Baseball.
you mean like hope I make it to second base?
that's helpful.
okay. All right. Be like that. - Uh...
maybe she forgot.
Yeah, she forgot or she got the date wrong.
we should... we should just forget it.
let's go back. Come on.
she has not forgotten. See?
Hi. - Hi.
come on in. - All right.
Hi. - Hi.
thank you.
okay. I'm going.
I'll be back around 1, but if you guys are finished early...
you can just let yourselves out. - Okay.
have fun. - Thanks. Bye.
Bye.
what time is it?
twelve after 11. - I think there's a strong possibility...
she's had second thoughts. - Mark.
if she does arrive, she'd be perfectly within her rights to turn around and run.
she won't.
Hi. I'm Cheryl. - Hi.
sorry I'm late. - Oh, no, no, not a problem.
come on in. I'm Vera, one of Mark's helpers.
nice to meet you.
nice to meet you, too. Just...
Hi, Mark O'Brien.
Hi, Cheryl Cohen Greene.
I'll be back in, say, two hours?
Yes. Perfect. - Okay.
so... - Your money's on the desk over there.
Yes, it is. Thank you.
that was the wrong way to start off.
it really was. Shall we start again?
please. You start.
although the aim is for us to have sex...
I'm not a prostitute. You don't have to pay me up front.
I have nothing against prostitutes, but there's a difference.
we can talk about that later. - I'm sorry.
the other thing is, there's a limit to the number of sessions we can have.
did Laura mention that when you saw her?
I'm sorry. I don't remember.
the limit is six, but that gives us plenty of opportunity to explore.
six.
so I understand you're able to have an erection.
Yes, but not by choice.
do you know how many men there are who would give anything for a natural erection?
is this your place? - No, it's a friend's.
the only bedroom furniture I have at my place is an iron lung.
I've been wondering maybe about possibly buying a futon...
you know, in case the need arose. - It might be worth thinking about.
I've got the space, I think.
it can be expensive, though, a nice...
futon, I mean. How much do you think a good one would cost?
because I never... - Mark, take a deep breath.
Yeah.
and let go.
do I seem anxious? - You do a little.
so Laura tells me you're a poet.
what's it like to be a poet?
it's a way of living inside your own head, which is where I spend most of my time.
but not today.
nice shirt, by the way.
thank you.
so I'm gonna ask you some basic questions, okay?
sure. - Explain to me, so that I really understand exactly what the iron lung is for.
it keeps me breathing.
I can spend a few hours outside of it with my portable respirator...
depending on how I feel...
but I work and sleep in the iron lung.
and how do you feel right now?
out of my league.
I meant your breathing. - Oh, fine.
in fact, better than usual. - That's great.
shall we get undressed?
sure.
so it's good for me... - Be careful.
did that hurt?
not yet.
do you have any areas of unusual sensitivity?
any parts of your body you don't want me to touch?
I have normal sensitivity all over.
I'm not paralyzed exactly. It's just my muscles don't work too good.
but you could touch me anywhere.
that's great.
Ow! Ow!
stop! It hurts! It hurts! Holy Mother of God. - What...? What's wrong?
Ahh! My fingers are caught. - It's okay. It's okay.
I've got it. I've got you. Don't worry. - Be careful, please.
mark, I'm gonna be really careful with you.
I don't want to hurt you or injure you in any way.
and it's really not sexy when you yell at me. Okay?
I won't yell at you any more.
but you'll tell me, calmly, the minute something starts to hurt.
Yes.
okay.
here we go.
piece of cake. Heh.
nice shirt. - You already said that.
did I?
okay.
I'm gonna slide these down. - Be careful with my feet, okay? My feet.
be careful. - Hold your breath.
okay. Whoa. There you go.
careful. Not so fast.
you ready?
whoa.
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
so the difference between me and a prostitute is a prostitute wants your return business.
I don't.
I'm here to help you learn about your sexual feelings...
so you can share them with a future partner.
mark, I want you to tell me how it feels each time I touch a different part of your body.
okay? - You know, whenever I'm naked...
everyone else in the room is always dressed.
now that I'm in bed with another naked person, it's very confusing.
why is it confusing?
I'd always expected that God or my parents would intervene to keep this moment from ever happening. - Not this time.
so if something feels good, you tell me.
if something is ticklish or bothers you, I want you to let me know.
I don't want you to tolerate anything. - Okay.
I'm gonna start with the top of your head.
you have soft hair.
it's really nice to touch.
does it feel good? - It does.
that feels weird.
weird good or weird bad?
just weird.
that's good.
still good? - Everything good so far except the ear.
are these the body awareness exercises?
you're very clever to have worked that out. - People tell me I'm very perceptive.
mark, would you like to see what I feel like?
sure.
you touch one, you have to touch the other. It's sort of a rule.
that's a good rule. - Are you wearing cologne?
Yes. - I like it.
I don't usually like cologne, but I like that.
so, Mark, I'm gonna move my hand along your body...
down to your penis, and if you feel me... - Ooh!
Oh. - Nice job.
I thought there would be more to it.
not that it was unpleasant.
after all, I was in bed with a naked woman.
she complimented me on my shirt, my hair.
she held my penis.
I haven't even seen my penis for over 30 years.
am I sharing too much, Father?
no, no. I'm used to it.
so next week.
friday the 20th, same time?
that's good for me.
next time, we'll start to work on intercourse.
were you afraid at the thought of seeing me? - Oh, God, I was terrified.
you should be proud of yourself. You did great. We've made real progress.
can I ask you something? - Sure. What would you like to ask?
anything, really.
just tell me something about yourself.
anything. - Okay.
um... I'm a very private person. I have a private life.
I need you to be aware of that. But that's about it.
this therapy's about you.
hello. - Welcome back.
perfect timing. - I hope you guys kept the noise down.
see you then.
what was it like? How do you feel?
cleansed and victorious.
doesn't get any better than that.
how about your first time?
Oh, let me think. - What was it like?
it wasn't all that pleasant. - Oh.
I mean, it was consensual and everything...
and I was in love with the guy, but his dick seemed enormous to me.
I didn't think it would fit. It was scary.
he was nice. I guess he couldn't help it.
was he Chinese? - Are you kidding me?
I only dated white guys in high school. - Why is that?
stick it to my mom and dad, I suppose.
are they happy now you have a Chinese boyfriend?
they're happy. I'm happy.
what's his dick like?
perfect size.
why do you call it a dick instead of a penis?
Dick...
penis sounds like some vegetable you don't want to eat.
heh, heh. - Dick sounds like what it is.
the thing is...
it was all over so damn quickly.
Yeah, tell me about it.
first session.
mark O'Brien is the oldest of four children...
and raised Catholic.
he was extremely nervous.
he yelled a lot when I took off his shirt, but I think more out of fear than pain.
he cannot masturbate, has had only the occasional kissing experience.
he's capable of achieving an erection easily, but the unusual curvature of his body...could be a serious obstacle to intercourse.
I just started working with this gentleman who spends almost his entire life...trapped in a big metal box.
did you hear what I said?
Yes. Yes.
and you are a saint.
sometimes the head of the penis may be too large...to penetrate the vaginal opening smoothly...
in which case the application of lubricant is recommended...to avoid possible...
Oh, my God.
so, what's on the menu for today?
we're attempting intercourse.
Heh. The big one.
what do you think of it?
intercourse.
overrated but necessary.
plenty of other ways of achieving the same result.
somehow you don't feel like you've done it until you've gone all the way in.
I want you to look at me this time.
come on, give it a try. Open your eyes.
do you like watching me undress?
I do.
so from now on...
you're gonna start to listen to signals from your body.
that way, you'll be able to have some control...
Oh, God! Oh, God.
damn.
shit.
I did it again.
this time, I ejaculated on her thigh.
I felt cursed.
that the whole enterprise was cursed.
it seemed like a totally just punishment.
God wasn't actually denying my sexuality.
he was just pointing out to me how useless it was.
it's amazing to me how often God is brought into the sex act.
I understand even among nonbelievers...the most common expression of sexual ecstasy is, "Oh, God." Heh.
okay, I don't want to hear any more about God cursing you.
I want the credit. It was my overpowering beauty that did it.
it took you by surprise. Now, where were we?
what do you mean, "Where were we?
I'm gonna touch you.
I'm touching you. - Okay.
and when we both feel you're aroused...
like now, I'm gonna guide you inside me.
is there anything I need to do?
just close your eyes...
and feel your body. That's all you need to do.
it won't fit. It's not going to fit. - Mark, it will fit just fine.
no, it's dangerous. It's too big. - It's not too big. Relax.
no, it won't fit. It'll hurt. It's too risky. - Mark, Mark, stop.
stop.
I promise you nothing bad will happen.
let's try again while you're still hard.
shit! Shit.
shit.
I'm really sorry.
stop being sorry.
and stop reading those stupid sex manuals.
there's still some time left. We could talk.
or you could suck my nipples. That went well.
or which would you like to do first?
I believe the root of his anxiety is his parents and his religion.
he believes he doesn't deserve sex.
he believes he's responsible for his little sister's death at the age of 7...
because his mother was too busy looking after him.
we discussed his fantasies, which were mostly masochistic.
again, the idea of being punished.
he's never seen female genitalia before and seems quite frightened at the thought of it.
my worry now is that it's never gonna happen.
I'm never gonna have intercourse with Cheryl or any other woman.
maybe intercourse would prove I was an adult.
maybe I don't want to cross that line.
maybe this is a bad idea.
do you want to know what I think?
please.
forget the psychobabble. I grew up on a farm.
even the animals need a couple of tries to get it right.
may I suggest you try to enjoy it more?
don't worry about the technical stuff. You're a poet.
be romantic.
uh... no.
uh... maybe.
Yes. Thanks.
that's good.
all right.
okay.
you nervous?
a little.
want a spritz? - Yes, of course I would.
I have a good feeling about today.
a very good feeling. - Good.
I had a terrible feeling it was never going to happen...
but I think today's the day. - Can I make a suggestion?
please.
stop thinking about it.
couldn't have wished for nicer weather.
you're not listening, are you? Stop thinking about it.
beautiful weather.
Oh, my God, Mark.
I'm so sorry.
I forgot.
she was very apologetic.
look, it may not be exactly what we had in mind...
but I noticed a couple of blocks from here a pretty nice motel.
might be worth checking out.
why not?
do you have anything on the ground floor?
I've got a single. - How much?
thirty-five plus tax.
my boss is the gentleman in the gurney.
he's supposed to be having a therapy session right now.
the facility we normally use had some scheduling mix-up.
we just need the room for two hours. Can you do 20 cash?
a soda machine around the corner. - Thanks.
and an ice machine if you need it. - I'm sure it'll come in handy.
thank you so much.
okay, that's it.
I've got a book to read. I'll be hanging around reception if you need me.
Thanks.
very atmospheric.
some people find motels exciting.
do you think I could be one of those people?
of course.
nice shirt. - As in racy and sophisticated?
you took the words right out of my mouth.
what's wrong with your boss?
basically he can only move his head.
so, what sort of therapy are they doing?
they're having sex.
you're shitting me.
okay. I'm shitting you.
Oh, no, come on, tell me for real.
what are they actually doing?
well, today, after some appropriate foreplay...they're gonna try to achieve full penetration.
are you okay down there?
I'm choking.
Oh, my God. The mouthpiece.
the mouth...
thank you.
well, I guess that's off the menu until further notice.
come on. Lighten up.
bonny girl, bonny girl
won't you be my bonny girl?
my dad used to sing that to my little sister Karen before she died.
she was kind of a sad little girl. It didn't do much good.
I'm really sorry that the last time I saw her...
I fought with her and made her cry.
my parents could have left me in a nursing home, you know.
then they found out that the average life expectancy for polios in nursing homes was 18 months.
they took me home.
gave me a life.
gave up theirs.
mark...
I'm just going to go to the bathroom for a quick pee...
and when I come back, we're going to achieve full penetration.
but before I go, I want you to close your eyes.
is this a game? - It's not a game.
just do as I say. Close your eyes.
picture yourself as a 6-year-old boy at the beach.
can you do that?
Yes.
very easily.
describe some of your feelings.
I feel exhilarated.
running along the Atlantic Ocean.
I feel the wind.
wet sand between my toes.
do you really feel like him?
Yes, I really feel like him.
and can you really picture him?
I don't understand. I said I could feel like him.
of course I can picture him. - From the outside.
I mean, as an adult.
as you are now.
looking at him, with his...crew cut and his little face.
Yes.
and are you mad at him?
do you blame him for getting polio?
was it his fault?
she either forgot to close the bathroom door or didn't bother to close it.
I found the sound of her peeing incredibly erotic.
and the sound of her tearing off toilet paper incredibly intimate.
by the time she came back, I had a terrific boner.
go on.
I'm gonna rub the tip of your penis around my vulva.
and when it's ready, I'll guide you in.
breathe slowly and think of something delicious.
they've been a long time.
Uh-huh.
you got a boyfriend? - Yes.
I grew up in Salem...
raised Catholic, like you...
but the Church did not appreciate my attitude toward sex.
you had an attitude toward sex? - I did. I liked it.
they think they threw me out, but I threw them out.
so, for years, I didn't believe in anything...
and now I'm converting to Judaism.
well, it's good to have some kind of insurance.
Oh, I didn't think of that. - Then why are you doing it?
my husband asked me to do it before his grandmother dies.
the idea is, if it makes her happy and him happy...it'll do the same for me.
the fact that I'm already happy does not seem to be relevant.
what does your husband do? - He's a philosopher.
Wow. At a university? - No. In his own mind.
he runs the house and plays guitar.
he thinks a lot.
it's getting late.
Hey, we did great today.
you were fantastic.
you're a fully-fledged male Homo sapien...
endowed with a handsome and substantial penis...which now has a proven track record.
you should be thrilled.
was I really inside you?
you were really and truly inside me.
for how long? - At least five or six seconds.
is that all?
that's a long time for some people.
you were pretty excited. I don't know what you were thinking about.
Yeah, I, whew, heh...
I don't, either. Heh.
it was...
it was all a jumble of sensations.
well, you definitely achieved penetration.
it was penis-vagina all the way...
and you definitely get an "A" for orgasm.
Cheryl.
did you come?
no, Mark, I didn't.
can we try for that next time?
is that what you want?
Yes.
that's what I want.
okay, then.
Hi. How you doing? - Good. Good. Come on in.
how are you? - Still exhausted.
beer? - No, I'm okay.
Oh, you need a glass? - That'd be great.
so...
on reflection, how do you feel?
it was okay.
I liked some of the other stuff just as much or better, but I'm glad it's behind me.
so am I. Congratulations.
Thanks. - Thanks, Rod.
when this is all over, I'm gonna write an article about it.
after all, sex sells.
seriously.
so you're only doing this for the money? - Oh, absolutely.
that makes me feel so much better about everything.
what is she like? Cheryl. You've never said anything about her.
she's the most wonderful person on the planet.
how's it going? - He reads too many books.
he has it in his head that after meeting three times...
we should be able to have penetrative sex which results in simultaneous orgasm.
boom, just like that. - That's very funny.
Yeah, I guess it is.
what do you think of him?
Cheryl?
I like him.
what are you thinking about?
nothing.
I don't believe you.
okay, I was just thinking about the whole conversion thing.
I still don't believe you.
then whatever it is...
I guess I'm not in the mood for talking about it.
so?
what do you think?
hello. This is Cheryl.
Hey.
mark? - Hey.
could we meet somewhere for coffee?
somewhere nice? My treat.
I don't usually meet with clients outside of working hours.
you know that.
we don't have to talk business.
mark appears to be indulging in typical transference behavior.
we know this is not unusual after first successful intercourse...
but I think he's particularly susceptible.
he cannot help but seeing me as the multifunctional, all-purpose woman.
mother, sister, teacher, lover, best friend.
at the same time, his anxiety about sexual performance has diminished.
you look stunning.
look at this.
thank you. - You're welcome.
could you put my cup right on the edge here?
sure. - Right on the edge.
and stick the straw in my mouth, please.
is that okay? - Perfect.
Oh, sir, I'd wait a couple minutes. That coffee's kind of hot.
Oh, thanks. - You're welcome.
so, what should we talk about? - You know, we don't have to do much talking.
I just wanted to be seen with you in public.
and I want people to say, "Hey, who's that gimp with that beautiful blond?
ha, ha, ha. - "How did he get so lucky?
if an old girlfriend from school you hadn't seen for years...showed up here suddenly, like, right now...
how would you introduce me?
as your boyfriend?
as my husband.
I mean, why not go all the way?
Really?
we're pretending, right?
so...
sure.
love Poem for...
for No One in Particular.
tell me...
tell me...
tell...
let me...
let me...
let me...
let me what?
Really? Really? Aren't you the one...that's always said it can't get personal?
that's a whole other thing. What are you doing opening my mail?
it was scented. I assumed it was junk mail.
even less reason to open it. Where is it? Give it to me.
you're not getting it. - This is none of your business.
you're still not getting it. I threw it out.
you didn't. - I fucking did!
what's up?
would you ask your mother...to pass the salt, please?
Ahem. Cheryl, would you please pass the salt?
listen, I'm... I'm sorry.
I know I really upset you before. - No, no, no. You didn't.
I'm fine. - You sure?
Yes.
I promise. - Really?
Yes. In fact, I've come around to your point of view.
you were right.
you're usually right about these things.
it was quite a lovely poem, really.
nothing astounding...
but it was heartfelt, and then... - Babe.
everything's great.
I just need to get to sleep.
okay.
good night.
let me touch you with my words.
for my hands lie limp as empty gloves.
Amanda.
I haven't seen you in a while.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm, um...
well, I'm going to Germany...
so I wanted to say goodbye to you before I left.
why are you going to Germany?
to study German.
for how long?
one or two years, maybe.
but, you know, we should keep in touch.
Yeah, but why go to Germany?
it's the only place in the world where humor is forbidden.
what?
you could always make me laugh.
I love you, Mark.
I really do. - Really?
Yes, I love you, but not in that way.
I love you, but I'm not in love with you.
blah, blah, blah.
the same old story.
I'm sorry.
I think it's great what you're doing with that surrogate lady.
well, it could have been you.
Yeah, it could have been...
but it wasn't.
I had this...faint hope that she would show the slightest bit of jealousy.
shows you how naive I am.
the fact that I was no longer a virgin...
that I was a made man, so to speak...
it made no difference to her at all.
want to go out sometime?
no. I don't think so.
what? Your boyfriend?
no. I'm busy. That's all.
what's wrong with this anyway?
we're having a nice time, aren't we?
it's okay.
well, if you have stuff to do, I can go take a walk...
if you're busy, and come back later. - No, no. Stay.
stay.
so come on, tell me.
what kind of therapist is she, really?
I told you the first time. She's a sex therapist.
today, they're working on simultaneous orgasm.
what's that?
boy, am I glad to see you.
don't you say that to all the girls?
Yes, but I always mean it.
remember about your breathing?
concentrate on breathing out rather than in.
mark was able to achieve an erection...as soon as I put my mouth on him.
he did the controlled breathing as I suggested...
and I was able to get on top and guide him in quite easily.
shit. Is it really in?
it's really in.
I couldn't believe it.
I was finally there.
too soon, I came.
but she kept holding me inside her.
then a look of pleasure brushed lightly over her face...
as though an all-day itch were finally being scratched.
she put her hands down on the bed by my shoulders...
and kissed my chest.
this act of affection moved me deeply.
I almost wept.
no one had ever done anything like that.
it was so unexpected.
so natural.
I love you.
I love you.
did you come?
Yes.
mark is breathing well...
learning to pace himself.
there is no real impediment to a variety of sexual activities...given the right sort of partner.
his deeper emotional needs...are outside the scope of my potential involvement.
what happens when...?
what happens when what?
when people become attached to each other.
what people? - Just people.
what's the chemistry in it all?
when people are attracted to each other... - Are you attracted to me?
God, no. - Ha-ha-ha.
I'm just talking hypothetically.
hypothetically...
they write poems.
they have sex.
and what happens next?
after poetry and sex?
nothing or everything.
the rest is by negotiation, as it were.
what do you mean?
I mean, you can leave it at love and attraction...
or you can make things complicated, like most people do.
have you?
Yes.
then, afterwards...
there was this...moment.
this glimpse of an awful sadness to come.
can I use the phone? - Sure.
will you call their room?
hold on.
Thanks.
what should we do next time? Any requests?
mark?
I'm thinking.
we have two sessions left. Is that correct?
that's right, or...
or what?
or we could stop now.
you mean make this the last session?
Yes.
what do you think we should do? - It's not we. It's you, Mark. It's up to you.
I want to know how you feel. - That doesn't come into it.
Yes, it does.
I don't just write poems to anyone.
mark, what do you want me to say?
how much I was touched by that?
how special this has been for me?
that's not gonna help you. It's gonna make it worse.
so you're saying that...the sixth session, that would be it?
that would be it.
if it's any consolation...
it's also hard for me to think about it.
then maybe we should pull the plug now.
I think we should.
I guess you might as well save that money. Buy yourself a futon.
just a second.
Bye, Mark.
Bye.
everything all right? - He did great. See you.
sorry. I have to run. - Okay.
you forgot this.
thank you.
I wanted to believe that because of Cheryl my life had changed, but it hadn't.
I just kept thinking, "Is that it?
is that all there is?
I think you've done a great thing.
so is this your first time? - It is. I'm converting.
Oh, wonderful.
come here. I need to look at your hands...
your fingernails and your toenails.
so, what do you do?
I don't think you'd understand. - You can try me.
okay.
I'm a housewife. - Why shouldn't I understand?
maybe I was mistaken. - Turn around.
and drop your robe halfway.
I'm gonna check for any loose hairs on your back.
that looks good. I'll take the robe...
and you can let your hair down now.
I see you're very comfortable being naked.
it's never been one of my problems.
sometimes new brides come with their mothers.
do I have to take this off? Can I please leave this on?
they've never been naked before.
no, honey, it all has to come off.
and it does? - And it does.
they stand at the edge of this pool with nothing to cling to but themselves.
nothing to hide behind.
this is your body.
this is the body that God crafted for you.
okay, Mark.
you can open your eyes now.
this is your body.
this is your body.
here among the...
Oh, about 37, 000 here tonight at the Stick.
local boy makes good...first time back in a visiting uniform.
runner on first with one out to the lanky left fielder.
and the pitch.
and he struck him out! I don't think he was expecting that.
Yeah, you can do it. Come on.
the person you are calling is not in.
please leave a message.
rod. I need your help.
the power's gone out...including the pump on the iron lung.
I'd say I got about three hours before I start to turn blue.
I hope you get this in time.
it's Mark. I'll try 911.
Ohh!
shit!
so this is how it ends.
mark.
can you open your eyes for me, Mark?
can you hear me?
mark?
come on, Mark.
they'll be letting you go today.
whoever looks after you will leave the portable respirator switched on at night, fully charged. You'll have at least one backup system.
okay? - Okay.
how close was I?
to what?
you know, to the... that tunnel thing and the...the light and the voice saying, "Don't go near the light.
is that what you remember? - No, I assume I passed out.
before that, I remember feeling sorry for myself.
hmm.
do you feel relieved now? - No.
relieved that God got to me in time, but I...
I still feel sorry for myself.
well, I'm sure there's a cure for that.
do you want to talk to someone or...?
I feel comfortable talking to you.
well, I'm just a volunteer.
I'm not a therapist.
I can recommend you to someone, if you like.
I'm... I'm sorry to be rude.
I'm just smiling at the idea that a therapist could do anything useful for me right now.
my priest couldn't.
are you religious? - Yes.
I would find it absolutely intolerable not to be able to blame someone for all this.
are you? - No.
I don't... I don't go to any church or...
I don't think about God very much.
I do believe there's a...mysterious logic or...poetry to life.
I guess that makes me a spiritual type.
Yes.
that would count.
would you like me to visit you?
are you married? - No.
do you have a steady boyfriend?
no. - Then please visit as often as you can.
Bye. - Bye.
take care. - Hey, hang on a second.
there's just one more thing I want to tell you.
what's that?
I'm not a virgin.
go ahead.
thank you for sharing that with me. - Sure.
I'm flabbergasted.
she adores me.
she'll do anything for me, and I can get pretty kinky sometimes.
here I was, ready to offer comfort to the forlorn.
it's supposed to be my specialty.
well, I guess I can throw away that little speech.
no, no. Please, make the little speech.
I'd love to hear it.
okay, fine. Here goes.
the meaning of love.
love is a journey.
I like it already.
that's it. That's all I've got. I told you, it's short.
love is a journey. - Heh.
I met Susan five years before I died.
she was the love of my life.
we had the same priorities.
baseball pretty much came first.
and we wrote each other mushy poems.
I never expected it, nor did she...
but that's often the way things turn out.
Susan Fernbach.
they say there is a cup of life which is either half empty or half full depending on how you feel about things.
of course, the two halves were never even.
not in my case, that's for sure.
I mean, look at all the years of unendurable crap I've had to put up with.
that fills most of the cup.
but in the little bit that's left...
what do I have to show for myself?
at the very least...
three beautiful women who all loved me.
and who will all show up at my funeral.
his was a dynamic voice in a paralyzed body.
a life lived fully...
long after he should have been dead.
and against all odds, by Mark's own admission...
he knew love.
emotional and physical love.
and in this way, Mark lived his life.
day by day by day...
breath by breath by breath.
for 49 years, he loved and he was loved.
and now Susan Fernbach will read one of Mark's favorite poems.
this is called:
love Poem for No One in Particular.
let me touch you with my words
for my hands
lie limp as empty gloves.
let my words stroke your hair
slide down your back and tickle your belly.
for my hands
light and free-flying as bricks
ignore my wishes and stubbornly refuse
to carry out my quietest desires
let my words enter your mind
bearing torches
admit them willingly into your being
so they may caress you gently within
within
it was designed to keep you breathing, but you never wake up again.
then, having fizzed your brain, it clears your system in minutes.
so, if things have gone to plan, we would never have even known to look, because we would never have known it had happened.
she was going to piggyback his heartbeat while it took effect, then rig him back up once it had.
clever plan. Except, sadly for her, turned out to be a game of two halves.
and her identity?
the thing is, Sir, we were hoping you might be able to help us with that.
me? How? -There were no guards at the door.
now, again, if nobody had known anything had happened, no one would have any reason to ask why the guards weren't there.
but that's not how it worked out, is it?
and now we have.
it was you, Sir.
and what do you intend to do with that information?
I think, more importantly, what is it that you intend to do?
because one of the cleverest killers since the Borgias knows that you just tried to kill him.
so what do you think he is going to do next?
it's time to call the cops, Sir!
only be careful who you call, 'cause around here, no one's who they seem.
be with you in a second, Gabriel.
who is she? In the hospital?
one of mine.
the one you had on Glickman?
a little extra tab? And looking for him when he disappeared?
and I presume she's the one who found him.
why'd you try to kill Gatehouse?
things were getting messy.
was it going to be me next?
you should never have let him get so close.
I wanted to see where it led.
and here we are, sitting in your office.
time to put your pictures in a box, don't you think?
Oh, and whatever you do, don't make a fuss before you leave.
I could certainly make a noise about you.
but then it would just be me giving the eulogy at your funeral.
and I only want to be thinking nice thoughts.
see, that's the trouble with you and your fast track.
when you hit a dead end, it's too late to break.
you're out, David.
and you want to start enjoying the benefits of your efforts in your charming little cottage in the Dales?
stay in line. Or start running.
you've got no one to blame but yourself.
what did you tell him?
take an early bath. His pay scale, he can afford it.
are you going to throw another blanket on this?
no. No, no, you can pick him up.
give him a couple of days to collect his thoughts.
I sense a promotion. -For you?
well, for both of us. You got your man, Gabriel.
what if it doesn't end here?
Oh, but it does.
it ends here.
I've supported you up to this point, because I knew he was a bad fucker but you go any further with this, you're going to start fucking with me.
you've done brilliantly.
brilliantly, just like I knew you would.
you should also know when to quit.
so quit now.
I think you're going to look pretty good in my suit.
what the fuck happened to you?
well, I need the next payment, yeah?
when? -Wednesday.
you'll have it.
so are we back in business?
I was never out.
you sitting this one out?
Yeah, just like you told me. Do you remember?
it's interesting, though, isn't it?
Harris's death, Ratallack's deal, you taking over.
it's almost like you planned the whole thing.
Shh. Don't be so noisy.
what's your plan for me, Jay?
ain't got one, Joe.
just as long as you stick to yours.
do you remember that, that rowing fellow?
who won all them Olympic medals?
and he said that if he ever got back in a boat again, -then we should shoot him. -Yeah.
he did, though, didn't he?
just so you know, if he'd have said that to me,
I would have.
yeah?
we're on.
she didn't fall, Joseph.
Yeah, she did. The nurse said she fell down the stairs.
she said she threw herself.
no.
it does happen. I've seen it before.
but when I left her this morning, she wasn't confused, she was quite calm.
sometimes, at this stage of the illness, the mist is kinder than when it clears.
but I'm not sure if this is the right place for her any more.
you want to take her away?
this time it's a fall, next time it could be worse.
I think we should put her in care now, yes.
I'm so sorry. -But I'm nearly there.
nearly where?
I've got a plan.
you can't beat this, Joseph. -We've got a plan.
change it.
change it now.
you know that journalist, Mc Govern?
he got killed. Motorbike.
Yeah.
makes you think, though, doesn't it?
what of?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I've got to go.
alone.
Why? -It's Laura.
commander Penney. -Are you alone?
out here.
it was me gave Gatehouse the money.
Why? -Because he worked for us.
us? -Counterpoint.
I thought you worked for the police?
a secret cell.
who set it up?
when he was Commissioner?
head of Special Branch.
1970... -Nine.
Oh. -No, it's not what you think.
we used the change of government to cover it but they weren't involved.
although we did turn to Section 5. -What for?
people. -Gatehouse?
he Secret Service? -Was.
he's Counterpoint. He has been, for 30 years.
he runs it?
the field, yes. We run the money.
I thought you were retired?
I am now.
and a man named Halton.
from 5?
and Paul Travis?
dead. Years ago. Cancer.
so just Khokhar and this Halton? No one else?
what did it do?
counterpoint, initially money laundering.
who for?
set up to be a sting.
Gatehouse started with small dealers, no idea who we were.
but he'd gain their trust, turn their money.
word spread, it grew.
like a card game. As it got bigger, so did the players.
finally, we got to a deal of 70 million, and with that, we thought we could bring the house down.
so, we went to the DPP, like a good cop should.
first strategy of arrest.
what did he do?
he shut you down.
he said it would never stick in court.
well, it's entrapment.
and as we'd shown him our hand, he told us to fold it, with immediate effect.
so, officially, we did as we were told.
we shut it down.
unofficially?
we made the deal.
seventy million.
into an account that didn't exist.
and then what?
we decided to play again.
but this time, we decided to stack the deck in our favour.
how?
by buying the players in the first place.
actually, it was his money man, Peter Glickman.
Gatehouse found him.
we gave him the cash flow, he linked up with Wratten, didn't tell him about us. And away they went.
200 million turnover.
per annum? -Mostly.
40 million net. -Of which you took... ?
ten percent of all sales.
into Counterpoint? -Correct. It became completely self-financing.
you still had to clean the money. -Oh, yes.
and we did that, too. -How?
trust me, one day you're going to thank me for this.
pensions, insurance schemes, yours, mine.
everyone's who worked for the Force.
this whole thing's about pensions?
for the benefit of all.
Really?
so does everyone get a boat like this or did you just tell yourself that when you bought it?
without us to plug the gap, the whole fund collapses.
it's government-backed.
how many schemes need to fail before it isn't?
we look to the future, son. Which nobody else does.
you're dressing this up as altruism. How sick is that?
we provide for the future, your future.
Harvey Wratten didn't get one and he was one of yours.
Gatehouse gave him an opportunity to retire. He didn't take it.
so you made him by putting him in jail?
and then Glickman had this crisis of loyalty and told him about us.
and Harvey threatened to tell everybody else unless we got him out.
so, get him out we did.
so then you gave the money to Gatehouse?
to buy drugs to give to Customs to get Harvey a Royal Pardon.
and when he got it,
I think we might have left it at that, everybody.
it was so compromised.
but Gatehouse decided to close Harvey's book.
so that's what he did.
and we've been cleaning up ever since.
so, who had the money marked?
I did. -Why?
gatehouse. He was starting to behave like he was his own boss.
I thought he might be setting the whole thing up just to run away with it.
it turns out money wasn't his primary concern.
for him it's all about control.
isn't it ironic?
one bit of police work I actually did, it's the bit that catches me out.
because if you hadn't marked the money...
Delaney wouldn't have spotted it. -And he wouldn't have told me.
and we wouldn't be here.
he's starting it again, you know.
who? -Gatehouse.
whole new set of players.
who are they?
you think you can stop this? He'll kill you.
he hasn't yet. -You can't stop this.
that's what we were trying to do.
look what's happened to me.
I can protect you.
it was foolish of me to think you could even try.
I didn't want a cup of tea, anyway.
No! No!
that was pretty low, Gabriel.
I had to go alone.
he wouldn't have taken any other excuses.
don't you trust me? -Should I?
around here, no one's who they seem.
I'm a police officer. -Oh, yeah. That card thing.
doesn't really rub, though, does it?
does with me. -Yeah?
me, too. -Then we're together on this.
I thought for you this was just a job.
it is, with you, every step of the way.
forensic OFFICER: Sir Richard Halton.
honey: Who are they? -I'm handing over.
what? Why?
section 5. He was, they are.
Gabriel: So what have you got?
well, it's been over 24 hours.
he appears to have suffered a blow to rear left side of his head.
what kind of blow?
what kind?
it may well be consistent with the fall.
Gabriel: Consistent, but not conclusive.
listen, after they finish, there won't even be blood.
you know how they are with their own.
what the fuck? Where's Khokhar? -He's disappeared.
well, put a wanted out on him. -I already have.
if we don't find him first, that fucking lunatic-looking vicar will.
Oh, and Honey's your gun girl, right? -Yes, sir.
then have her stick to you like tassels to a stripper's nipples.
sir, we should go to the press. -Oh, what with?
suicide and a domestic accident?
find that fucking Gatehouse!
before he buries us all.
what's going on here?
he's got a potential shadow in the line.
Whose? -Harvey Wratten's successor.
his name's Joseph Bede.
he runs a flower import business, he's completely clean, but then he would be.
that's how he'll bring it in. In the flowers.
the trick is knowing which shipment.
get it wrong, you'll never get it right.
so, who's the shadow?
he's right at the centre, so he'll have to disappear for good.
how much is he looking for? -Quarter of a million.
Yeah, and I'm looking to support Barack Obama, but some things you're just never going to get.
do you know, I thought we could get together on this, cops, Customs, like the happy family we're supposed to be.
if it's any consolation, I also hate my brother.
what's he bringing in? -400 kilos of heroin, single shipment.
street value 22 million.
he's starting it again. -Who?
what if I could get you the money?
all of it? -What if I could?
the we got ourselves a shadow.
come, please, sit down.
you want some food? -No.
you need to eat. -You sound like my dad.
do I know your dad? -He was an arsehole.
an arsehole who wanted to see his son eat.
only thing is I'm not much with family.
no? -No.
cause with me, it's either business or family. It can't be both.
then you and I, I think, will have little in common.
because you inherited your business from your father?
well, the thing is you didn't know, did you?
you know, I've known you since I was like, Well, that big.
and the truth is you've always been a bit of a hero of mine.
if I could window my house with flattery, I wouldn't need the glass.
and I remember you had an elder brother.
didn't you?
and that's who your father left the business to.
but he was noisy, wasn't he?
everywhere he went, everyone knew he was coming.
until one day, he just didn't turn up ever again.
and then there you were, shh, quietly taking control.
just like your family should have given it to you in the first place.
Oh, it's hard though, isn't it?
waiting for that moment to come.
I mean, that is strength.
real fucking strength.
maybe you should have taken a little strength for yourself before you went clacking back to your uncle with the cops in tow.
but the thing is, though, Mr. Babur. Mr. Babur.
maybe I've taken it already.
maybe that's what I was doing all along, taking your lead.
it's never nice to watch an old man refusing to leave a disco, is it?
and I cannot tell you how many times Harvey had been asked to quit, right?
but he just kept on wiggling.
silly old sod.
until in the end, someone had to bundle him off the dance floor.
you.
by leading the cops to him.
you understand now, don't you?
family or business.
so, let's talk business.
you giving it in?
I'm taking it back.
where to?
where it came from in the first place.
Oh, Jonah.
Laura, I still don't know who I am.
or what I am.
what I've done to you is unforgiveable, I know that.
I want to start to make it better.
I want to make it all better for you.
and the baby.
doing this is the way I can.
I love you.
I thank you.
there's 230 there.
he can whistle for the rest.
where did you get it from? -From where this all began.
but as far you're concerned, it doesn't even exist, you understand me?
Ooh! Are you offline on this, then, Detective Inspector?
no, I'm right back on it.
200, minus my 10 percent.
what?
and if Julie Christie offered you one, would you still pull that face?
okay. -Ah, ah, ah.
there's someone else you've got to kiss first.
so, what's the story?
it's whatever you want it to be.
man: Clear!
clear!
clear!
Oh, I could arrest you for that.
you arrest someone? Now, that is a laugh.
you knew it was a setup.
no. How could I have known?
they've been working me for months. I would've put my life on it
Yeah, well, maybe you just have.
where is he?
you seriously expect me to know that?
move on, move on.
Yes, move on.
I'm going to bust your arse!
you've been stung.
I have. We all have.
it hurts.
bloody happens.
you must know something. People like you always do.
I think you bust a rib.
you got a wife?
what?
kids?
you threatening them?
no, but you are.
it's just a job, Beatty. It's just a job.
Yeah, and this is me doing it.
you just don't get it, do you, boy?
do you know how long I've been in this business?
almost 30 years.
now, do you know how I get to survive this long?
it's by not knowing.
it's knowing gets you killed.
so, do you know what I think you should do now?
you should go home.
just go home in that car you're always checking.
but this time, don't even bother to lock it when you get there.
tell them how much you love 'em and that you're the luckiest man alive.
and it'll be true and do you know why?
because you never even got close.
shit!
magic.
it's all about getting them to look elsewhere.
and never telling anyone how the trick was done?
never.
good.
and finally, we are done.
we are.
what about your end buyer? Have you exchanged yet?
I do that next.
five million.
five million.
you don't want to go again? -No.
stick to the plan? -Yes.
it was a clever one.
thank you.
how is your wife?
these are the ties to bind.
my daughter makes them.
give one to your wife, keep one yourself, then when you are alone, you will never be apart.
remember, I warned you if there is a human in a plan there will always be a flaw?
yours is Jay Wratten and he knows how your trick worked.
so watch out, I think he means to play one on you before you go.
Why?
was it your Johnny Cash who said "I'm giving up" right before he came back?
it certainly wasn't me. -Isn't that what they all say?
good luck, Joseph Bede.
what are you going to do with that? -Jay.
you're not...
no. But he's likely to try it on me.
always knew he would.
you know you can't use that?
no, it's marked. -So what are you going to do with it?
you know, I was born near here. -Yeah?
Yeah.
not like this.
it's a shithole.
I'm sorry I got too old.
at least you got there.
what am I going to do when you go?
stick to the flowers.
no.
it's a cut-throat business, that one.
Hello?
goddamn it!
she's in our care now.
I'm sorry, Joseph. -It's not over.
it's not.
it's all right, darling, I'm here.
let go of me.
let go.
please.
let me go.
have you lost something?
well?
with all the money you're about to collect, there is nothing you won't be able to buy.
nothing!
ready when you are, Joseph Bede.
just a minute.
I love you.
you should go home.
this is my home.
working late, Detective Inspector?
it's you that keeps me up.
I can tell you where Khokhar is, if that'll help you sleep.
if you can, it means he's already dead.
there's more where he came from.
like who?
we should meet.
you really think?
Yes, I really do.
the lines have changed, Gabriel.
penney and Khokhar, they tried to have me killed.
so, now, my enemy's enemy...
isn't that ironic, me calling you?
where?
people don't do bad things just because they want to stroke a white cat.
all they thought they were doing was protecting their family.
and if you'd have stayed within it, they'd have protected you.
with a pension.
no one else is going to pay it.
that's why they had to start it again.
to make sure it would continue.
you shot Harvey Wratten.
I shot Harvey Wratten.
and who'd you get to take his place?
the one that got Harvey busted in the first place.
hidden depths, that one.
plus a kid over on Bob Harris's side. Quite a whiz with numbers.
a new Wratten and Glickman.
and who's going to run 'em?
why didn't you kill me when I was in hospital?
you seem so good at it.
I would have.
but Khokhar told me not to. -Why?
he'd been urged to change his mind.
by who?
most people, they just see the surface.
him, he looks to the bottom of the pond.
he certainly saw inside of you.
you work for him?
we've come to share the same sense of order.
by putting him up there?
and you beneath.
and how are you going to do that?
how you going to stop me?
a gun.
trained on you.
now.
and all I have to do is wave my hand, and she will shoot you.
why are you doing this?
because it matters.
for other people to see you, standing out there in all that bright, white light?
I'm sure it does matter.
the problem is, Jonah Gabriel, that kind of glare, it just turns you blind.
because all I have to do is this, and your light goes out.
No!
you'll get over it.
I'll live with that for the rest of my life.
well, at least now, when you hit 55, you'll be able to do it in style.
leave the gun at Khokhar's feet, then come back here and get in the car.
Why?
he doesn't belong here.
Ah! Questions, questions.
which I'm sure Detective Inspector Honey can answer.
we're not looking for anyone else in pursuit of this enquiry.
so you believe Commander Khokhar shot Detective Inspector Gabriel before hanging himself?
Yes. We do.
because?
because, Detective Inspector?
you're really trying to rub it in, aren't you, Michelle?
would be nice.
because as you've no doubt already read it in our statement, it appears DI Gabriel discovered that Commander Khokar had stolen a considerable sum of money from the department.
how much? -250, 000.
all in bank coppers?
we found Gabriel's car outside a remote cottage owned by Khokhar, and the three casings from the bullets used to kill him near a pathway leading up to it.
so, whatever way you want to add it up, Michelle, it still cost one of my best officers his life.
and where is this money now?
we believe it was thrown from a rooftop in Central London.
so where it is now, well, quite frankly, it could be in any one of our pockets.
so, you know, please feel free to have a whip round.
do you have any comment on the murder of Joseph Bede?
the flower man? No.
but it is true that Customs conducted a recent unsuccessful raid on one of his premises?
well, you'd have to ask them that question.
I'm sure they can give you a much fuller answer than we can.
Yes, but wasn't Bede murdered in the same way as Harvey Wratten?
when you're shot, you're shot, Peter.
you don't think there is a connection?
between what?
between Joseph Bede's murder and DI Gabriel's, given it was Harvey Wratten's murder Gabriel was investigating at the time?
we've long since turned that particular page, Peter.
and I believe it was your newspaper I was reading when we did so.
so, for the record, you don't see there's a connection?
are you meaning all this in a Jungian sense?
you know what I mean, Commander.
then, for the record, there is absolutely no connection between Jonah Gabriel and Joseph Bede.
so now it's our turn. -Yeah.
for how long is that going to last?
I think you know the answer to that already, and if you don't, you should.
twenty years, and then a headshot in the back of a car?
not if you remember the rule.
yeah?
and what exactly is that?
simple.
you, you're the threads.
but me,
I'm the rope.
midwife: Okay, Laura, you're doing really well.
it's almost here.
I need one more big push from you.
give me a push now.
it's out.
here's your boy.
hello.
you know, it's funny, but in my business, you can't ever wash them enough.
now, then.
let's take a look at you, little fella.
there you go.
well. I look forward to working with you, little man.
you can't have him now.
no? Well, let's wait a few years.
at least until we can buy him a playsuit.
you can't have him now.
um, I don't follow you.
he's mine.
in here, in my memory.
and all I choose to remember is the best of him.
and you can't take that from me.
ever.
and you will never take my son.
I didn't kill your husband.
but it's what you represent that did.
Oh, and is that how you're going to bring him up?
Jonah on one side, us on the other?
he'll know right from wrong, yes.
is it really that simple?
Yes, it is.
do you know what, Mrs. Gabriel?
I don't think there's anyone, you, me, your husband, even this little fellow here when he grows up, who can absolutely say, without any shadow of a doubt, what side of the line they stand.
no.
I think the best that any of us can ever hope for is, well, just to walk it.
I hope you like the room.
Jonah paid for it.
Yes, yes, he did. Of course, he did.
that's... That's what insurance is for.
and it doesn't stop here, as you know.
so, whatever you choose to tell him, we'll still make sure his every need is catered for.
because if there's one thing you can be absolutely assured of, Mrs. Gabriel, we always look after our own.
I have an attorney for you.
I'm becca doyle.
if everything hinges on her, I'd be a fool to give up that hammer.
just like you were foolish for letting me know how important she is to making your case.
you're looking for more business?
right now I'd like to go home and wash this place off.
has anyone from the department come around asking any questions?
someone has been asking questions.
he said he was a parent of an autistic child.
that him?
Yeah.
Lem: Pittario, where's your stash?
Kavanaugh: About 6 months ago, we found this kilo of pure heroin in the glove compartment of your car, but you never logged it into evidence.
LEM got picked up by Iad.
got him wearing a wire.
I'm going after mackey and his team.
and I'm going to be right here to make sure you don't blow it.
we got to see our next moment. When he jumps dirty, we'll know.
here.
it's ok. I'm on the clock.
I thought you were vic's ci.
whoever's got the money.
good. It's good.
Hey, I need admissions from mackey and the others on crimes they committed, all right?
questions make cops suspicious.
you walk out of the room every time he opens his mouth to say more than good morning.
you think I haven't noticed this?
I'm just doin' my job, all right?
vic and I aren't attached at the hip.
well, then get attached!
cause you're dragging this out, trying to have it both ways.
you're torturing yourself.
you made a choice.
it was the right one.
and now you got to start living with it.
hold on a second, ok?
one second.
I... I know it's your birthday.
you mentioned that you're a fly fisher on one of the tapes.
Thanks.
we're going to be working together for a while and I just thought, you know...
I know this is tough.
but we're both going to make our way through all of this.
all right?
Yeah.
I would've pegged you for a corner office.
first time a police officer's stepped foot in here.
I've got a case that'll interest you.
my schedule's full and I've been finding my own cases since I was 30.
not like this one.
5 minutes.
everything I'm about to say falls under attorney-client privilege.
Yeah, but it doesn't obligate me to take your case.
IAD's launched an investigation into one of the guys on my strike team.
I don't represent cops.
especially corrupt ones.
we're good cops.
this is about the system turning its back on 4 of its own.
you'd be better off going somewhere else.
you shuffle gang bangers in and out jail all day.
this is a chance for you to take a shot at the big boys.
what do they have on him?
claim they found a brick of tar in his glove compartment.
it's bullshit.
what else?
the only thing I know for sure is that they're going after my whole team.
guy named kavanaugh is in charge.
I'd dig into it myself, but it would raise too many red flags.
now there's the first real truth i've heard.
you want to keep your knowledge of the investigation secret, and no one would suspect I'm working for you.
so we agree that you work for me then.
I've got an old boyfriend in the city attorney's office.
I'll ask a couple questions.
but that's it.
woman: Next thing I knew she was laying there.
Fiji, barbados... all those tropical vacation places, you're talking typhoon.
just looking out for you.
look out for the tape.
angle looks car-to-car.
bumper's got a dent. Could be fresh.
maybe there's an incident out on the road, someone in the other car shoots, victim veers off here.
Oh, christ.
get additional units down here.
tell danny I said now.
umbilical cord.
I checked the goddamn amber alert requirements.
we don't have enough to file.
somebody cut that baby out of the woman's stomach.
then get me a witness, a description of the other car. Something!
if they wanted the child, why risk pumping the mother with bullets?
someone wanted it to look random.
maybe the boyfriend.
Billings: What do we know about him?
works nights in a machine shop.
hasn't been home since the murder.
I've got unis stationed at the house.
vultures are gathering.
I'll get rid of 'em.
wait, wait. No, no, no. Let's use them.
somebody knows something.
we just need to pull the right heartstrings.
all right. Good. You keep working. I'll do it.
wilshire's not giving us any bodies for the search team.
not if we can't prove the baby's alive.
that's bullshit! Call again.
no. I'll call.
who would do something like this?
What'd the ex have to say?
absolutely nothing.
and I called a couple adas i went to school with...
quiet on all fronts.
good.
not good.
none of them offered to look into it for me, which means they know something major's in motion.
what haven't you told me?
david aceveda's name come up with your friends?
the city councilman?
he's assisting kavanaugh in this investigation.
Why?
because he used to be captain here.
he had me pushing the legal line a couple of times when it meant getting a killer off the street, making him look good to the voters.
overseeing the investigation means he can steer it away from himself, make me and my guys play the heavies.
starting to get your blood running yet?
I'm interested in the true story of this heroin they caught lemansky with.
what does he say about it?
I haven't been able to ask him.
IAD's got him all wired up, listening to our every word.
well, they wouldn't make that move unless they had a witness or corroborating evidence.
I'll find out what i can.
good.
me, too.
so the kid's about, well, uh... here.
right?
the knife goes in, goes straight down, got to be careful about the depth.
I'd say it's intuitive.
you wouldn't need medical training at all.
so tell the newshounds we're not looking for einstein, just a garden-variety psychopath, possibly a woman.
usually it's a woman who's recently lost a baby or who's been claiming to be pregnant.
I'm never going to be able to sleep until i have this kid.
Yeah, I'm here.
you're not going to get any sleep then, either.
Thanks. 911 received a call at 5: 17 this morning from a payphone one block from the scene.
they hung up.
that could be our line to the baby.
so how we gonna find them?
you've got to convince them to come to us.
need another cup?
two should do it.
we on that missing baby yet?
Vic: No. Dutch and claudette are handling it.
Shane: Captain wants us available to round up all the other miscellaneous sickos.
listen, I'll be back in a few.
I gotta take a dump.
smells like you already did.
all right. 5 minutes to hear what's going on with kavanaugh.
every detail.
he suspects i'm protecting you.
all right? I've been helpful, but not too helpful.
nothing he can check out.
any chance he's got a witness, someone who saw you take that tar?
shit.
or emolia. I mean, she was in the house, too.
no, no, no. I got a 6-month relationship with her. She's solid.
pittario's the one with an axe to grind.
look, if they got pittario, man, i'm screwed.
we don't know that yet, but we're gonna find out.
no, no, he puts that heroin in my car, makes iad's case, what then?
a first-time offender, you do what?
5 years max, probably less.
I'm just saying worst case scenario...
you refuse to wear the wire, you let kavanaugh arrest you.
we'll work behind the scenes to undermine him, and you'll seal us off from this, right?
look, the shit you've done and i'm the one going to jail?
nobody's going away. Are you kidding me?
hasn't been a jam yet we haven't slipped out of.
there hasn't been a witness before or an iad cop wiring one of us.
nobody jumped ship when antwon had your balls in a sling.
and I was willing to put a bullet into antwon to keep it off the rest of you. Remember?
Yeah, and we got you out of that before you had to go through with it.
which is exactly what we're gonna do for lem, but if we can't...
you're gonna look out for us, right?
Yeah.
Shane: Ok.
OK.
but we're gonna get you clear of this.
now, ronnie and I will track down pittario and we'll squeeze his balls.
I hate this.
don't worry.
we got you.
let's get the wire back on.
what kind of a person cuts a baby out of its mother's stomach?
the kind that shoulda been an abortion.
there's the man. Gimme a sec.
for what?
aceveda's been updating me on a few things.
be right back.
Councilman!
a moment of your time.
what is it?
some asshole dumped a few couches
I got a la-z-boy over on scott.
bums find that out, it's a motel 6.
you screeched up here to talk to me about trash pickups?
Billings is too squirrelly to ask the city for an extra dime.
someone's gotta do it.
Lemonhead: Hey, we got a 187!
anyway farmington's garbage is your area.
that's a little below my pay grade.
call someone in waste removal.
OK.
but I hate to see your entire district become a fire hazard.
get what you need?
Yeah, he was very helpful.
the car's on this side. Down there.
green explorer came around the corner, started blasting as he exited the diner.
nice piece.
let this be a cautionary tale.
you find that heroin dealer?
pittario cleared out of his house.
he's a ghost.
only sign of life is a couple of squatter crackheads.
Hey, telephone worker got a bird's-eye from the pole.
he getfor the suv?
no, but he gave unis a partial plate on a witness who had a better view.
another white guy, jumped in his ride after the shooting, took off.
all right.
you guys work your angle.
LEM and I will figure out who's got a problem with the hair club for men.
all right, man.
that baby is still out there.
this disgusting crime occurred at approximately 5: 15 a. m. This morning.
e beg you, while the baby can still be saved, [beeping]
please call if you have any information about the altercation that led to the heinous murder of isabelle arrington.
we need you to call our tip line.
I pulled the records of every single person who worked with isabelle arrington.
so far just petty stuff.
here's our grieving boyfriend.
your neighbor told us isabelle was screwing somebody else.
that's bullshit.
baby probably wasn't even yours.
don't you say that!
you goddamn liar!
if the baby's alive, tell us.
Oh, god.
please let him be alive.
it's a boy?
you noticed that when you cut him out of isabelle's stomach?
we did one of those scans.
we saw his stuff.
you gotta believe me.
OK. Um... we'll get somebody to give you a ride home.
stay by the phone, ok? We may have more questions.
you accuse me of slicin' my baby out of my girl's stomach, and now you want me to go home and wait on you?!
we're sorry for your loss.
I don't want your damn apologies!
I want you to find out who did this to her!
and where my baby is!
victim did a stint in lompoc 8 years ago.
been clean ever since.
no family, but coworkers at the pet store said he's got no enemies.
these matches to the partial plate on the witness?
Yeah. I ruled out 50 of them.
got about a half-dozen possibles here.
pittario hasn't been arrested in 6 months.
that's the longest he's gone since he turned 18.
he's off the grid.
if the him up and he made a deal to give up lem, that arrest wouldn't show up on his record.
check this out. Leon frankel.
lives in the same building as our victim.
turns out they both got the geds in lompoc.
Oh. Let's find out why hank's study buddy didn't stick around to talk to the police.
we lookin' at this guy as a coward or suspect?
well, whichever jacket fits.
hold on. Hold on.
is that leon frankel?
that's me.
we were just on our way out looking for him.
what did he do?
we were canvassing on that baby.
he threw a bottle at the car, cracked the windshield.
then he asked if he could smell my sweet spot.
even shane stopped using that line.
pretty stupid way to get yourself arrested, leon.
I had a bad day.
that bad day include seeing your pal hank preminger shot dead?
if a friend of mine was in trouble, I'd do everything i could to help him out.
sit down.
I was scared. I heard shots. I ran.
Hey, look, maybe if i sit here for a while, something will come to me.
you're walking down the street with your enemy-free friend hank.
shots go off, he's dead and you know those bullets were meant for you.
now you're not safe.
you're too damn cheap to spend 20 bucks on a fleabag motel.
you get yourself arrested because it's safer in here than it is out there.
only we're not your goddamn bodyguards!
who did it?
I... I don't know.
get out.
what?
get out!
get out!
no, no, no. Wait a second.
I remember a green suv.
great. Think of anything else, give us a call.
we're releasing leon on his own recognizance.
wait a minute. He's supposed to post bail.
I'm overriding bail.
you're gonna get me killed out there.
that's a chance i'm willing to take.
OK, ok, come on. Please.
a couple days ago I had a client, fell behind on his payment.
awesome pool player.
now, I knew this guy, right?
he did me a solid back in the day.
we used to hang out at gary's tavern, a little place on sunset.
cut to the part where someone wants to kill you.
my boss gus wanted me to take a crowbar to his right arm, and if i did that, his break would never be the same.
so, you know, I gave him an extra 24 hours.
most loan sharks don't take too kindly to independent thinking.
look, gus never would've known, but this ungrateful prick disappears with the 40 large he owes.
now gus thinks we split the money
and your friend hank takes the hit meant for you.
Yeah. I feel like shit about that.
who shot at you?
I'll bet you anything it was that little ass-suck works for gus.
he's always trying to hone in on my business.
what's his name?
I don't know.
I just call him ass-suck.
excuse me while I get a kleenex for the rest of this sob story.
Leon: It's a protection game.
I got all these young guys comin' up behind me.
it's like no one wants leon to get ahead.
Jesus, what took so long?
I had to track pittario through ins.
Miguelez construction registered his social security number with payroll 2 months ago.
scumbag got a real job?
he's working on a site over on hillhurst.
Pittaro's breaking a sweat, we know he's into the feds.
let me wrap this up.
Hey! You're early.
so am I. Ha ha.
how's andy?
he's good actually.
he's inside.
um, I was wondering, how old was andy when he was diagnosed?
around 3.
there's an andy at this school, but he's not your son.
what's going on?
when were you planning on telling me you're a cop?
who told you that?
nobody.
I was married to one.
I see them everyday in the e. r.
you all walk the same.
ha. Yeah, we do.
I'm a lieutenant, iad.
you'd make a good detective, corrine.
I don't know what you want or why you've been lying to me, but stay away.
ms. Mackey.
I need you to know that your husband and his team are under investigation.
so what? I was his wife, not his partner.
I don't know what your involvement is yet, but you and are going to do a lot more talking.
and you mention anything to him about me or this investigation, it is obstruction of justice, so i find out that you told him anything about this case, that's on you, and that's prison.
we'll talk later!
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't a baby, just so you know.
it's very generous of you to come in.
could you tell us what you saw?
that pregnant lady decided she had to turn all of a sudden, almost drove into that other car.
other car, think it was white, goes honking, gets crazy, starts shootin'.
911 put me on hold.
5: 30 in the morning. So I hung up.
you said you saw something on the car, something that could help?
the white car had one of those decals on the back window.
what did the decal say?
I have a nephew named devontrey.
so i remembered the decal.
it was one of those r. i.p. Ones.
tape: The kind that shoulda been an abortion.
there's the man.
gimme a sec.
for what?
aceveda's been updating me on a few things.
be right back.
Councilman! A moment of your time.
what is it?
come in.
you said you have an update.
Lemansky's birthday's today.
his pals, they either don't know or they just don't care.
that's the update?
my best friend forgot my birthday, i'd be pissed.
this could be a way in.
anything interesting happen with you today?
like what?
like visitors?
he came by the office.
what about?
some bullshit sanitation complaint.
I think he just wants to shove it in my face that he's de facto running the barn.
you didn't call him?
don't have regular sit-down meetings with him or anything?
just trying to figure out which uniform you're wea councilman.
well, it sure as hell isn't mackey's.
sorry for getting you down here.
next time I have a birthday alert, i'll just call you on the phone.
you're not safe here anymore.
I'm taking you. We got to go, got to move.
Why? What happened?
we got a couple of possible leaks.
get your stuff. Whatever sebastio needs, ok?
you said vic wouldn't find out.
I'm not saying that he has.
either way, he calls, you don't answer.
he comes by, you're not going to even be here.
the volume on this thing just got turned way up.
let's go.
Yes, I'm pittario.
nice try, dickwad. We know the guy.
where give me your papers.
let's see 'em.
let's see 'em.
you got a job off this.
What'd pittario get for his papers?
he got dead.
dead?
what? You sure he's not laying low, taking a cut off of your hard-earned money?
huh?
no. 3 months ago, we were down in el sa doing a heroin deal.
the sombra negra...
he got to him.
and he sliced his neck in half.
you got to consider emolia.
they might have some other kind of corroborating evidence against lem.
man, she's got a messed up kid, she's got no job.
if the iad offered her a deal, she could've jumped at it.
I've spent time with this girl.
and the boy.
she's not going to turn on me.
why don't you call her then?
check in.
sir? Have you seen the woman who lives here?
hace como dos horas.
gracias.
Thanks.
I got every decal place in town checking special orders.
meantime I need an extra pair of eyes.
3 years of death in l. a. County.
holler if you see a jevontrey.
Dutch, it's corrine.
are you there?
Hey! What's...
I need to ask you some questions.
Oh I can't right now.
please. I'm pulling up now. It's important.
sorry, i didn't know who else to call.
I can't stay long. What's going on?
promise this stays between us, ok?
promise that you're gonna give me straight answers, no matter what you think of vic.
of course. Well, what is it?
some iad guy's been coming to the kids' school, trying to get me to say things about him.
IAD's into vic?
I wonder what they've got on him.
I mean, probably take your pick.
listen, I don't know, but he's threatened to send me to jail if i said anything or if i don't cooperate.
I need to know if he's bullshitting me.
I mean, can he send me to jail?
well, a lot of times a person who goes down didn't have anything to do with the original crime.
they found out about it afterwards, lied, covered it up.
well, what about spousal privilege?
they can't force you to talk, but if they can prove you knew about any of vic's actions, it makes you a coconspirator.
what's going to happen to your kids if something happens to you?
you see?
you're their best leverage against him.
but I don't know anything.
well, then, take away their leverage.
be completely up front and honest.
L-l-i'm sorry. I've really got to go.
Hey, um...
why would someone take prednisone?
I don't know. A lot of reasons.
arthritis, lupus, asthma, crohn's disease.
it's a common antl-inflammatory.
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
you don't have to memorize every picture.
just flip. Flip it, man.
you want me to make a mistake?
cut the guy some slack, all right?
he's got a target on his back.
emolia, it's me again.
I got a salvadoran thing going on.
it's time-sensitive, so call me back.
I need some air.
I'll come with.
that's the guy that works for gus.
that's ass-suck.
right there.
emolia's gone.
neighbor saw her leave with a black guy.
kavanaugh. You call her cell?
3 times, including just now.
you're her paycheck.
when is the last time she didn't call you back in 5 minutes?
if kavanaugh got to her somehow, it's nothing i can't turn around.
he's probably got her stashed in a safe house somewhere.
come over here.
had to start with pittario.
iad flips, some shithead ends up dead.
they got nothing... they go to emolia, twist her against her will.
what does she know besides the heroin?
nothin'. I've kept her clean.
is there any chance lem's really working with these guys?
see, that's what kavanaugh wants...
for us to doubt each other.
this guy's using every angle.
prick talked to corrine at our kids' school!
this guy's chattin' up your ex?
you think you might have mentioned that?
I just did. Warn mara.
Ronnie, you tell whatever you're bangin' this week, don't talk to strangers.
all I need is 5 minutes with emolia to coach her on what to say, let her know that we're there to help her.
trust me, we find her, this whole thing goes away.
well, how are we gonna find her?
Hey, we got an i. d. On our shooter.
Justin lamott. Vehicle matches.
Yeah. Better luck than we're havin'.
we're gonna need to stick leon in a safe house until we make the arrest.
all right. I've got a list of available hud houses.
let me see.
these are for captains and above only.
captain. They found the baby.
won't leave your office.
the bones in his chest are essentially pulverized.
Pulverized? How?
I'd say a fist.
somebody punched a newborn?
stepped on him, maybe. There's a variety of trauma, skull fracture, knife wound on the left leg.
I'll know more later.
thanks for the rush.
on this one, anything you need.
a typhoon in fiji's looking pretty good right now.
did he even have a chance?
crime scene says he died hours ago.
it's a special kind of monster.
Yeah, and that monster's name's tevares glade.
just got a call back from a decal place on pico.
2 years ago, tevares placed a special ord
in honor of a dead uncle. Pulled his record.
tevares drives a white monte carlo.
and has 6 arrests, all for violent crimes. 4 of them with a sean deeks.
why did 2 men cut a baby out of a woman's stomach just to beat him to death?
there were more than 2 of them. Look.
in the blood.
fingerprints. Jesus, he's covered in them.
the big ones tevares glade, or sean deeks... maybe both?
but the little ones...
you think maybe there was a girl here, too?
ass suck, 12: 00.
out of 6 rounds, this dude manages to get 4 in the wall, 2 in the wrong guy.
loan shark hired a professional.
that's some shit to be dealing with on my birthday.
it's your birthday? We should get wasted, man.
Yeah.
Hey, buddy, you Justin?
Why? Why?
Gus sent us.
little pissed off about the way things went down this morning.
what are you talking about? You shot the wrong guy.
I didn't shoot the wrong guy. I seen that prick hit the ground.
but you saw his friend hit the ground. You just confessed to murder.
you want to spare yourself the needle, tell us where to find gus.
Gus! All right, all right!
Justin ided the loan shark, got 'em both.
you tell leon he's in the clear?
Yeah. Freak tried to hug me.
but you insisted on the blow job.
I musta ate somethin' this morning.
third time i gotta shit today.
be sure to inform us of number 4.
look, pittario's a dead end... literally.
we think kavanaugh's gonna try to get emolia to give you up.
I don't even think she saw me take the h.
good. Meantime, vic's convinced a little t-l-c puts her on our side.
if kavanaugh finds out we got to her, this blows up.
we even know where she is?
Ronnie and i checked out the safe houses, came up empty.
but her son has occupational therapy twice a week.
emolia won't let sebastio miss those.
I chased down this therapist's unfaithful wife in exchange for a couple of sessions for emolia's kid.
what do you want me to do?
just put on your wire, head home, kick back your feet, have a beer.
kavanaugh's turning up the heat.
we think, uh...
we think he might be planning to formally arrest you.
if that happens, we'll be ready to bail you out.
Hey.
Hey, I need you two guys.
this old man here, he's been waiting here for hours.
apparently, some assho moving around in a camper trailer.
the guy sets up streamers, flags... whole thing's very patriotic.
he's selling care packages and bogus body armor to our troops in iraq.
grandpa here paid 300 bucks of-the-art vest.
his grandson called from iraq when he got the mail...
let me guess... piece of shit.
Yep.
go pull a car.
glad to see you two kids are workin' it out.
[Police chatter on radio]yeah.
your p. r. Instructor said you weren't in class the other night.
Yeah, well, something about almost having to blow a van full of skin peddlers made me wanna go home and drink a bottle of wine.
I wasn't up for baton training that night.
so you missed a class with no valid excuse.
I took 3 classes already.
and when exactly do you lay off?
when I feel safe riding with you.
there's our patriot.
put him in the cage.
night, officer.
what's a little bit like you doin' being a cop?
put your hands on top of your head.
What'd he do?
he a murderer?
Hey, listen, i know we're shorthanded and everything, but do you think i can get reassigned?
you want a different t. o?
I've tried with julien. I really have.
if there's murderers here... it seems like he doesn't know the difference between teaching and bitching.
I can't be in here with murderers!
I've taken 3 baton classes.
my instructor thinks i'm doing great.
it's ulieJn... he just keeps on...
gotta have a room or something!
look, we don't have a room. This isn't an inn.
this guy's in here for resisting arrest.
and this guy's in here for scamming grandpas into buying bogus body armor for their grandkids over in iraq.
no murderers. So don't get your panties up in a bunch.
same goes for you.
we found your fingerprints on the baby, tevares, dried in the mother's blood.
Sean and tevares killed that lady so you could have the baby.
and then what? He got too much for you to handle.
he cried too much.
so you let them beat him to death.
we also have your friends. We've got their finger prints.
pretty soon, one of them's gonna start to talk.
good defense attorney'll just says they found the baby in the dumpster.
fingerprints mean they tried to revive it.
think the girl's the way to go?
she's our best shot.
want me to give it a run?
I've got someone else in mind.
OK. Let me feel him...
like right here. It's his foot.
you wanna touch it?
you know, I didn't even... ever really want a baby.
but now i've...
I guess you're too young to know what i'm talking about, huh, all those maternal feelings and all?
which is why i'm thinking that you did the cutting.
no.
Oh, come on.
those idiots you're hooked up with, they wouldn't even know how to make a baby, much less cut one out of somebody.
you feel it? That man lost his baby son, his girlfriend.
bitch brought that on herself.
is that why you wanted that baby?
you didn't think she'd be a good enough mother?
shit, we didn't even know she was pregnant.
when you shot her?
she almost ran us off the road.
my man don't stand for that.
she almost killed us, so... shooting her was like self-defense.
right?
we didn't see the belly till she got out of the car and started trying to run.
they was just gonna drive off, but i said, "no. We gotta save the baby.
they was thinking they was gonna sell it.
but my sister myesha, she had 2 abortions when she was my age.
now she wants a baby.
but... those doctors messed up something in there, so...
I thought maybe she could take him.
but the baby wasn't breathing right, so we did the stuff you see on doctor shows.
we... cleared out his mouth and turned him upside down.
but that didn't work, did it?
so I made tevares do that cpr stuff and...
the minute he pressed down...
we heard everything crack.
that's enough.
we was just trying to save...
you know what? Just... just stop talking.
they've given this kavanaugh carte blanche to work your case, any resources he needs.
what's kavanaugh trying to nail you for?
because this isn't about some misplaced heroin.
Aceveda and the department need a poster boy for corruption to sell their softer, gentler force to the voters.
why pick you as a scapegoat?
you're a push-the-envelope kinda lawyer.
I'm a push-the-envelope kinda cop.
which aceveda sanctioned.
this really does go to the top.
there's some pretty high-powered cages to rattle.
so you'll represent us?
just you.
no.
we're a team.
the four of us come as a package.
I've seen these things go down.
everyone eventually needs to look out for themselves.
you don't understand.
we're not the typical lowlifes that you represent.
we're a family.
we're surviving this together, or we go down together.
Hey, hey!
I need some officers in here... quick!
stand back!
what the hell are you doing? What?!
you took your gun into the cage?
someone could have grabbed your weapon!
do you see all these people around you, huh?!
look at me.
you trying to kill one of them...
or you trying to kill one of us?
man: Hopefully one of you!
you know why you're dangerous?
cause this isn't real for you yet.
so you're gonna get on me, too?
if you wanna be a cop, you gotta recognize your mistakes, learn from 'em.
all i've done is try to be nice to you... to everyone.
you got a problem with me, it's because of your own shit!
you're used to being the queen bee around here, but you don't get so much attention now with those stretch marks.
so you're gonna make my life miserable.
every cop here has made mistakes... including you.
and I bet you anything all of you got cut more slack than me.
if you go out of this room with that sniffly nose and those red eyes, those guys will never, ever respect you.
so you pull your shit together.
Jesus, it's bitches like you that make the job hard for the rest of us.
Hey, man, where is she?
she hasn't come out yet.
she should have been outta there 10 minutes ago.
you sure you saw her go in?
Yeah, man, unless she went out the back.
OK. Here we go.
man: Get in.
is she getting an iad escort?
Hey, hang loose. They might be watching.
you're not going on vacation, are you?
I haven't decided where yet.
no, um...
you're sick.
how sick?
Dutch, I was here yesterday.
I'm here today. I'll be here tomorrow.
I don't know what that means.
I'm your partner.
look, all that stuff i said about you not being committed, checked out, i'm... dutch.
it's ok.
I got to take these pills.
if anybody shows up, you call me.
vic. What the hell?
you didn't return any of my calls.
I got worried.
this dealer was giving me a hard time.
I had to get away.
sebastio asleep?
those sessions take it outta him.
what's up with you?
when did iad approach you? What?
kavanaugh. What's he trying to get you to...
no. I don't know a kavanaugh.
why are you lying to me?
I'm sorry, vic.
what happened?
did he come to you and threaten to put you in jail if you didn't cooperate?
huh? Because... there's a way out of this, you know.
what did you tell him?
that I saw your guy take the heroin.
that's it.
all right. It's ok.
soon as we get you outta town, your statement won't mean anything.
no, l... I can't leave.
whatever kavanaugh's squeezing you with, I can make it go away.
now pack your shit...
but sebastio.
I'm gonna take him to your mother's.
I'll make sure he gets back with you once you get settled.
I didn't know you then.
what?
you've been behind this all along?
you tipped the iad about the heroin?
if I had to do it over again, i'd have said no.
you've been good to me and sebastio.
you didn't... you didn't say anything?
you never warned me...
all this goddamn time?!
I told them that... shut up!
he checks in on me, vic.
he'll be here.
what else did you tell him?
nothing, i swear!
6 months!
6 months, you coulda warned me!
God...
one of men... maybe all of us are going to jail because of you!
[Sobs] I was scared.
I helped your son!
I tried to get you out of this life!
I'll leave... tonight.
and go where? To a phone booth to call kavanaugh?
no. [crying]
without you, Iad's case goes away.
you knew what i was, and you started running with me.
I report on people for money, vic! That's what i do!
I found you once. I can do it again.
who'd you call today? What?
on your cell phone. Who did you call?
I... only my cousin, a few hours ago.
you called her to get a message to her to tell me how to find you.
got it?
Oh, jesus. It's you.
detective mackey...
what are you doing here?
ha. It's my ci. What the hell are you doing here?
emolia's helping us with a salvadoran drug ring.
IAD, vice...
you're a jack of all trades.
I'm sorry. Did i miss something?
why is it that you're here?
I got spooked.
called my cousin.
she called vic for me.
next time you hide one of my C. I. S...
will you put a car out front?
this isn't safe.
what's going on? Jesus, no one's telling us anything.
I talked to Dr. Thiel...
...and Tavon's condition is grave,
...traumatic brain damage.
he's got a tough road. - Can we see him?
he's in ICU. It's family only.
he's on my team.
if he takes a turn either way, I'll let you know.
Yeah. - Did you get my messages?
no. What... What's going on?
tav on got into an accident, man.
hit a parked car full speed.
he might not make it.
Oh, man.
listen, we're at Mission Cross. You gotta get down here.
Yeah.
I kind of had a rough night myself.
I mixed it up with this guy at the Three of Clubs.
I gotta take this other call.
lf you can make it, you should come. - Okay.
we gotta clean this up.
Hello? - I called you.
what's the problem, ma'am?
I think my ex-boyfriend's in the house.
Lyle Dockman. He's been harassing me.
my bedroom light was off when I went to work.
did you get a restraining order out on him?
Yes. It just made him madder.
all right, we'll check it out.
police.
anyone in the house?
I'll check the upstairs.
ma'am, stay back, please.
bedroom's clear.
Oh, my God.
Halt! Police!
Halt!
you okay?
Yeah.
is he gone?
Yeah.
I'm here. What?
sorry about Tavon.
what do you want?
I need you to sweep the Alvarado Corridor.
looking for? - Cruisers, loiterers.
there have been complaints from business owners and citizens.
you want me for something real, I'll be at the hospital.
the doctors said they won't know anything for a couple of days. I'm sorry it happened.
... but there's still work to do.
I'm a detective not a janitor.
get your units to do your sweeping. - I'm giving you the broom.
strike Team is a special unit.Since your promotion is jam us up with bullshit gigs all you've done .
maybe with Gilroy you could pick your special cases, but now it goes:
chief Bankston to Aceveda to me to you.
you don't like that pecking order, take it up the ladder.
see who is out of a job.
Alvarado Corridor, huh?
till I tell you otherwise.
you all right?
bulb blew out.
Shane! - I got it.
hang on.
coming.
sorry, I was... I was on my way... - Forget it.
Wyms has us on a shit sweep.
Jesus. Someone clocked you.
dude, who kicked your ass? - It was this guy...
this drunk asshole was pawing me in the bar...
...and Shane told him to get lost...
...and him and his friends jumped him in the bathroom.
there was more than one guy?
no, it was mainly one guy.
I mean, the other guys just stood there and watched.
how is Tavon doing?
did he come by here tonight?
Tavon? No, why would he?
he said he was gonna mend fences.
it's just us.
laundry night.
everything else all right?
Yeah. I'm good.
I'm taking care of him.
stay home.
I don't want you showing up at work looking like you got bitchslapped.
fiesta siesta.
anybody still here in a minute gets run in.
you heard the man. Let's pack it up...
...party people! - Come on.
thought this was a free country.
got a curfew in this part of town, homes.
not for me. I'm over 21.
what do you think?
about 14 coats of high-end enamel?
let's see.
yo, man. I'm gone, man.
where were you tonight around 10: 00? - Jogging.
I do three miles every night after work.
you weren't doing a 100-yard dash through your ex-girlfriend's backyard?
Elena? I can't go within 1000 feet of her.
or call her, but you've been leaving messages on her machine.
before the restraining order. It's a crime to want another chance?
she's not giving you another chance. - Not yet.
not ever. - Someone was in her house tonight.
is she okay? - She's fine.
can anyone verify you were jogging tonight?
you'd have to ask around.
okay, well, we're watching over Elena.
and now we're watching you.
problem?
this is your 10th citation for cruising in the last four months.
I juice up cars.
humming out here with my baby's the only advertisement I got.
try the Yellow Pages, because we're bringing the car in.
when do I get it back? - About a month or two.
after you see a judge, pay a fine. - Well, take care of her till then.
every cent I made the last five years I got wrapped up on her.
Really? I would have begged you as more of a mutual fund guy.
what do I gotta do to keep my wheels?
flip me someone juicier than you.
here's her ride.
wait, wait. This vato Aramis.
I call her twice a month. I remember her birthday.
her only son. - So you're taking her?
seen Claudette?
she and Dutch just caught one. Another possible elderly rape victim.
what do you need?
she's got me working the Alvarado Corridor...
...next few days. - Right. Sweeping duty.
last night, I'm tagging this guy.
we're about to tow away his Hot Wheels, he spills about a guy...
...sneaking contraband into Chino Prison for his gang buddies.
what kind?
drugs, cigs, cock rings, weapons of mass destruction, who knows?
you checking into it? - I was looking for her to see...
...if I should stick with cruiser duty. - Follow up on this.
wherever you want me.
gentlemen, what do we got? - B & E, robbery.
fits your rapist profile though. Elderly woman, living alone.
you read my memos? - Watch C. O. Makes us.
did the victim call it in? - No, I didn't.
I did.
detective Wyms and Wagenbach.
Patty Klopp. My mother, Luann.
they broke in last night.
I stopped by this morning and noticed some Hummels were gone.
couple of tchotchkes. So what?
someone broke into your home, Ma.
you have to report that. - And now you have.
she's supposed to be watching her sugar levels.
anything taken from the bedroom?
not that I know of.
when did the robbery occur?
last night.
came home around 9 from the movies.
you see anybody?
just saw my things missing.
you weren't afraid?
I've lived in this neighbourhood for 40 years.
your daughter says she's trying to get you to Encino.
you'll have to kill me before I retire to the valley.
you got something special in mind for the ride back?
funny.
the compulsive eating, the odd, distracted behaviour.
I think Luann was raped.
well, yeah, she's a tough, old broad, but I saw it too.
you are agreeing with me?
I'm agreeing that she loses her dignity if she admits she was attacked.
her dignity and her independence. Speaking of losing your dignity...
the bed was stripped. There was nothing in the clothes hamper.
whatever you find in there is gonna be too contaminated to test.
it's too bad.
why do you throw out a perfectly good set of sheets?
to bury the truth.
wonder how many other buried sheets there are out there?
here's Aramis. - Byz Lats are showing initiative.
Diagur's running them better than I thought.
yo, Ronnie, you see him?
guy with the cigarettes? Yeah, I got him.
that's good.
either this guy is sneaking shit into China...
...or he needs the world's largest patch.
let's see where he takes us.
we can't provide 24-hour protection to women who has an ex with a temper.
I did some checking up on this asshole.
the last ex who got a restraining order on him left a good job in Cleveland,
...to move to New Hampshire just to disappear from this guy.
she was sure that he would kill her.
this one feels real to me, sir.
look, Danny's right.
this one feels real.
okay, we can escort her to and from work. Extra patrols.
you got one week for the guy to violate the order before I pull the plug.
all right. Thank you, sir.
don't thank me. She should be thanking you.
I got 29 B & E's of elderly women. Eleven in the last six months.
called the hospitals, they'll give us a heads up if anyone fits that profile.
what about your new promotion?
you sure you got time to help me on this one?
for this? Yeah, I'm all yours.
yeah? Ever hear of this guy?
this "Mueller's GeograPhical Profiles."
that's the criminologist from Duke?
doctor of Criminal Logistics.
takes data on serial violent crimes, victims, nature of the assault...
generates the most likely location of where the perpetrator lives or works.
needs three confirmed cases to work up a preliminary profile.
we've only got one victim confirmed. - Two if Luann comes clean.
you think Aceveda will spring for it? It's expensive.
no. Let's find numbers two and three. Then we'll stick him with the bill.
you already made arrests?
caught them exchanging packages of smokes and drugs...
...along with 7500 in cash.
guess that's the smuggling rate these days.
good work. - Banger puts together care packages.
the white guy is a frozen food delivery man who drops off at Chino twice a week. - What are you working?
I got a tip from a cruiser last night...
...about a guy sneaking swag into the state pen.
shouldn't be hard to get Joe Trucker to roll on cholo and vice versa.
you moved off the Alvarado Corridor? - Yeah.
couldn't find you so I moved up the ladder.
so I had some cigarettes.
we're not talking about a couple cartons of Marlboros.
we nabbed you handing off 20 thumbs of heroin too.
must be the old man's. I learned in school to just say no.
you take the orders, gather the shit, hand them off to Fred...
...who sneaks it in with the frozen peas. Am I right?
we got you dead on rights, man. - On all your wrongs.
look.
I spoke to the DA.
if you cooperate, I can make sure that you do your time at China again...
...with all your fellow banditos. - Else, who knows...
...maybe you end up someplace chilly like Shasta.
can I go home now?
sorry. It's gonna be a little while.
what's the problem? - We just talked to Aramis.
he told us the whole thing.
the twice a week drop-offs you make at Chino State Correctional Facility.
I'm a delivery man. That's my job.
there was heroin in this week's care package.
I don't look at what is in the packages.
but you knew it was wrong.
I should go home now.
my wife is making dinner. - Whoa, easy. It's all right.
you're under arrest. You understand that?
no. That's not right.
if you can confirm who receives this stuff on the inside...
...maybe we can make things a little easier on you.
no. This is a mistake.
this can't happen.
I'm not a criminal.
the Strike Team just made a bust that included $7500 in cash.
I need you to run the serial numbers of the bills against these numbers.
again with this? - Let me know if you get any matches...
...and then return that list straight to me.
why do you have me doing such menial things for you?
because you're my assistant. - I could be so much more to you.
with the election and everything.
I have a campaign staff for that.
they don't know what they are doing.
you've no idea the mistakes I fix before they land on your desk.
and I appreciate it, but for now, please.
just check the numbers on that list against the money in evidence.
you okay?
it's Layla.
she reported a robbery five months ago...
...and after a lot of handholding, just admitted she was raped.
Jesus. This guy... - She tell you anything that will help?
no condoms, no climax.
a lot of cuddling. - That makes two confirmed.
I struck out on my end.
we need one more.
I don't remember anybody snooping around.
delivery guy? Anybody that seemed suspicious?
in this neighbourhood?
try to find someone who doesn't look suspicious.
the reason we ask, Luann, is because there is a man...
...who is breaking into homes and sexually assaulting women.
sexually? - I'm flattered, detective.
he's targeting women your age.
what are you talking about? - Did someone hurt you?
of course not.
thank God.
I pulled Tavon's accident report. - Thanks for doing that.
you know, witnesses saw the car swerving a couple blocks before he hit that parked car.
before? - Yeah.
is Tavon a drinker? - I don't think so.
which direction was the car going in?
north on Perry.
North?
Thanks.
Hey.
I thought you don't want me coming in.
I thought you were gonna come alone.
she wasn't sure I was good to drive.
thoughtful. - Yeah.
what's up?
Tavon was headed away from your place.
witnesses saw his car swerving all over before he hit the car.
Toxi report shows no drugs or alcohol.
that's weird.
what do you think happened?
don't know yet.
don't have all the facts.
there's something missing.
like a coffee table or a painting.
look, he came over.
gave me this backhanded apology.
we had some words.
he jumped me.
and I tagged him back with a pretty good shot.
how good and where?
to the back of the head. - The back of the...
he has brain trauma.
it was from an accident that happened miles away.
he was swerving all over the road before the crash.
your blow probably caused it.
you could face charges.
what did you hit him with? - A paperweight or something.
look, he was all over me.
where were you during all this?
I was doing laundry in the basement.
Really? Whites or colours? - She wasn't there.
all right?
this thing was all me.
hold on. - Here's your list back.
thank you. - Got two matches.
what? - Two of the bills.
their serial numbers were on the list. I wrote which ones down for you.
where are you taking him?
interrogation.
I'll meet you upstairs. - Sure thing.
we miss a piece of the puzzle putting together Aramis?
no. We just need to talk to him on an unrelated matter.
I'll let you guys get back to the Alvarado Corridor.
Thanks.
who is the suit?
his ID said, Treasury.
that's the second T-fed in our house in two weeks.
what's Treasury want from our collar?
Aramis is one of Diagur's tenientes.
you think that Aceveda knows about the corners we cut with Diagur to get those guns back?
one way to find out.
care about that.
just tell us where you got the 7500 in cash you gave to the delivery guy.
I already made a deal with the other cop.
ain't gotta rat on my boys.
your crime is now under federal investigation.
that's why Agent Nell is here.
which means any previous deal, got null and void.
bullshit. My ticket's punched to Chino. - It's punched wherever we say it is.
captain Aceveda has been checking money confiscated in arrests.
so?
two of the bills you had in your possession were marked.
they were stolen from an Armenian money laundering ring.
Oh, shit. - We've been waiting for it to show up.
guess what? It showed up in your hands.
our money is marked? - No way.
I don't know anything about... - Aramis said he got it from Diagur.
we got our bag back from Diagur 20 grand light.
we are starting at square one. Who did you get the money from?
I don't know where I got it from. - Not good enough.
whoever stole that money killed two Armenians to get it.
we're gonna tie someone to these murders.
you want it to be you...
...or someone else?
I really don't think you want...
...the death penalty for something you didn't do.
go! Go!
I got a sick feeling, man. It's all crashing.
not if we steer it in the right direction. - Our money is marked?
some of it? All of it?
we don't know, man. - Where are we going?
silence his smoking gun.
we are looking for Diagur.
who are you faggots? - Watch your mouth.
we're the guys busting you for possession of an illegal substance.
Where's Diagur? - Who?
today's not the day. I just need to talk to him.
where is he?
Yeah. You give me a message, I'll pass it on to him.
how long you been out of Terminal Island?
not long enough.
you don't tell me where your boss is at, you gonna be jumping back.
home is where the heart is.
huff the pipe, asshole. Just take a hit.
take a hit.
take it.
take it! Goddamn it!
join the party, sweetheart. Come on. - He's at Yolanda's.
one street over.
brown house with the Madonna.
Jesus Christ. - Get out!
it's okay. Okay, I know him.
how old are you? - Old enough.
glad Mom has such a firm grasp on things. Wait outside.
let's go. - I need my clothes.
what you doing breaking my freak, yo?
you got a Byz Lats lawyer on your speed dial?
one of my boys has an uncle. - Call him.
get him down to the Farmington station house now.
what's there?
your prison delivery boy, Aramis. - He's done it it's without me knowing.
I'm all over your Chino game.
unless you want my boss all over you, you get your lawyer down there...
...and make sure he zips it.
now.
someone left a rose in Elena's mailbox this afternoon.
don't you have things to do?
actually, unlawful use of a mailbox is a federal offence.
we got done talking to your boss. Technically, you were on the clock.
supposed to be making business calls.
you got proof? - Your boss has agreed to monitor...
...all your calls and your online activity here at work.
you can't do that. - No. But she can.
you can either spend your 9 to 5 stalking...
...or you can spend it working. You can't do both.
listen, lady.
this is my job.
not for long if you don't leave Elena alone.
have a nice day.
I'll talk to you later.
lawyer is on his way. - Good.
you said you didn't have my back.
why helping me now?
feds are buzzing around the money you gave to Aramis.
it's tied to a robbery.
somebody ripped off the Armenian mob.
well, man. I ain't suicidal.
the Armenians find out that you guys are suspects...
...the Byz Lats will be in up to their necks.
I'm just trying to prevent the war. Where did you get the cash?
who knows? It comes in a dozen ways.
anybody asks, that's your best answer.
you give Aramis anything besides the 7500?
Yeah.
fifteen grand. - You handed it to him personally?
think I trust some flunky with it? - Your fingerprints could be on it.
any idea where he stashed it?
Yeah. In his freezer.
my idea. - Original.
get somebody to his place to pick it up.
you disappear for a couple of weeks.
Oh, shit. - He's back in the cage.
he talked.
he goddamn talked.
cold hard cash.
I'll run the serial numbers against the master list.
I get this to the lab before 5...
...I can get fingerprint results by morning.
you coming?
he gave us permission to search his place.
I'm curious what else we might find here.
I'll call some units for a ride.
Diana Peabo. She came into the ER last month.
injuries sustained during a home robbery.
her kids just brought her in again. Allergic reaction.
mixed up two of her meds.
they said that she's been kind of out of it since the attack.
one of the nurses saw your bulletin. - Thank her for us.
it's a him actually.
they are in Consultation.
how is Tavon?
he's the same.
excuse me. Could I talk with you a moment?
detective Wyms. Detective Wagenbach.
how is your mother?
she will be just fine. What's this all about?
we wondered if we could talk to her about that robbery last month.
why now?
we think your mother might be able to help us find the person who did it.
it's not here.
police! Don't move.
keep your hands in the open.
Hey! Don't move! Don't make me do it, man.
stop right there. Put your hands in the air.
don't make it worse for yourself.
turn around.
on your knees, man.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, man.
Hey, don't make this mistake.
I'm a police officer.
so you a cop, huh?
that mean you can do whatever the hell you want?
Hey.
you can still get out of this.
Oh, now you telling me what to do.
Hey, man, you need to calm your friend down.
tie him up. Tie him up with something.
put out your hands.
hurry up.
don't throw your life away.
I ain't afraid of prison.
but you should be.
you ever...
...suck a dick like a cell bitch, copman?
don't do this.
it's your turn to gag on something.
no.
open up, sweetheart.
no.
you wanna die instead?
no.
captain.
that's great.
probably had a limo come pick him up.
can I get confirmation on that pickup address?
there's no one here at our current location.
negative, 1-Tango-16. Unable to confirm.
let's head out.
they are gone.
let's see that mouth.
el Presidente around? - Captain Aceveda? No.
where is he?
conducting a search at a suspect's house.
could you raise him on the horn? I've got an important question.
I'll try, but I've left two messages for him in the last 10 minutes.
his cell phone coverage is bad sometimes.
no.
Thanks.
get your phone, man.
what? - Your phone.
I wanna get a Kodak of this.
okay.
you ready? - Yeah.
I got it.
you don't remember anything else?
there's nothing about his face?
his height?
I'm gonna tell you something you're not gonna like.
I know, as a son, it's the last thing I'd wanna hear.
what's going on?
we think your mother wasn't just knocked down by that guy last month.
we believe he may have sexually assaulted her.
sexually.
it would account for why she's so distracted lately.
that's a lot of pain to push down. - We hope we are wrong.
why don't you start by telling us what happened?
I found her lying on the kitchen floor. She couldn't stop crying.
what else? - Back window was broken.
said a guy came in, knocked her down, grabbed a few things, then ran.
she would have told me if...
maybe she needed more time.
yo, man, if he tells his boys, we are done.
you gonna say anything?
no. - Hey, you can't believe that shit.
what? You wanna kill him?
you do it.
you want it done...
...you do it.
Hey, man.
I have a little girl.
I have a wife.
mother.
yo, man, you gotta do it.
I'll watch. - You've been wanting the juice, man.
do it.
if your mother were here...
...what would she tell you to do?
not this kind of juice, bro.
not this kind of juice.
it's the other cop. Let's go.
I'm in here.
bust the door.
it's locked. Try it again. - I got it.
he's here! - Sweep it.
you all right? - Yeah.
clear. - Clear.
they got my gun. - They?
Yeah.
the two of them. - Are you hurt?
no.
I was able to fight them off.
mom.
I need you to tell me what happened during the robbery.
I told you everything I remember. - Have you?
what else did he do to you?
where are those Police People?
he hurt you?
stop it, Vincent.
raped you?
don't you say that.
mom, did he?
Yes, he did.
why didn't you tell me?
mama, why?
hold it.
you see something? - Maybe.
let's go. - Yep.
you can't keep me here. - That's true.
you'll probably make bail sometime tomorrow.
trial won't be for another six months.
but in between...
...every time you roll a stop sign I'm gonna hand you a ticket.
every lunch break you take, I'm gonna be sitting at the next table.
Yeah, that's harassment. - No, Lyle. That's stalking.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, I had a little run-in.
no harm done.
let's not waste any time on it.
Hey, what happened?
he fended off a couple of bad guys.
miracle he hasn't called a press conference yet.
she's in there with her husband's service weapon.
my key wasn't working in the new lock.
she shot at me when I opened the door.
you okay?
come on, I told you to stay in the car.
can you drop the gun? - Put the gun down, Luann.
it's okay, sweetheart.
I know what happened to you.
that's our wedding.
you were very beautiful.
I was a size 4.
can you tell me what happened to you?
he robbed me.
I didn't want to get robbed again.
Hey, Cassy.
Hi, Mr. Mackey.
Cassidy, Owen said hello to you. - Hey.
sorry. She's struggling with this whole thing.
it's okay.
Hey, little man.
I'm drawing a zoo.
Hey, that's great, Matty. - Corrine's in with Megan.
Hey.
how did she do with Dr. Franks? - You know shrinks.
you ask them one question, they give you five back.
she's being quiet and a little stubborn.
he wants you and I to do sessions too.
one on one.
I want her to get all the help she needs but me laying down on a couch?
it's not gonna happen. - Stubborn and incommunicative.
wonder where she gets that from?
how is Tavon doing? - The last surgery gave some hope.
the brain tissue bruising isn't bad.
that's good. - The next 48 hours should tell.
good.
if he recovers, would he be able to remember anything that happened?
I got him working on this undercover assignment.
well, he could remember every detail.
or he could wake up and barely recognize his reflection.
if Tavon lives, he could remember everything that happened.
if he dies, an autopsy could reveal the blow to the head before the crash.
we'll figure it out, baby.
chew on this, baby.
we just found out the feds marked some of our money train cash.
what? - Part of a sting they are doing on the Armenians.
Oh, shit. - Deep.
and if that's not enough, this accident leads back to you...
...without us getting self-defence on the books.
I. A.D. Could be all over you...
...right at the time we're gonna cash in on the money train.
so, what do we do?
Oh, now it's "we."
tell me the truth.
I did.
you had a fight.
one of you hit him. - It was self-defence.
if you both tell your story right now this could all go away.
look, we gotta make a decision.
right now.
which road are we going down?
look, everybody knew Tavon and I had bad blood.
no, we gotta make this disappear.
we think this cuddler rapist has been around for a while.
we've looked at like-crimes. We've interviewed dozens of women.
we've confirmed three victims, which is required for his analysis.
mueller's results have been proven accurate down to the square block.
we match this with known offenders, we narrow our search dramatically.
well, if this Mueller can help, then let him.
Mueller isn't free.
his fee is $5000. - Right.
it can't happen. - We're really at a standstill on this.
stranger perpetrator.
the victims could pile up until he makes a mistake.
and so far, he hasn't made one.
captain?
no. I said, no.
we don't have the money.
all right, roll up that rug.
hit some yard sales, pick up a new rug and a table.
picture too.
use cash.
I'll drop by this weekend and help you patch that wall.
what did you hit him with?
nice paperweight.
put that in the truck with the rug.
it's a brand-new iron. I washed it. It's clean.
we'll get a new one.
put the broken table on my truck. I'll dump that too.
this is dangerous, you know that, don't you?
it's not my fault that he crashed.
you mean, it's not Shane's fault.
he must really love you.
he's doing what he thinks is right.
what do you think is right? - I trust him.
we're gonna cover our tracks the best we can.
but if push comes to shove...
...you gotta step up and tell the truth.
da never gonna pursue the conviction of a pregnant woman trying to protect the father of her child.
it's not how Shane wants to do it.
he'll do it however you tell him to do it.
is everything okay?
sure.
sweetheart, let me get that.
Hey, hey, hey.
luminol.
spray it all around. Use the light.
blood traces will glow.
here, I...
fumes could be dangerous to the baby. Clean up is on you.
thank you. - Yeah.
sir, we caught that stalker lurking behind the victim's house last night.
good.
a place that knows no sadness.
where even feeling blue is a happy thing.
a place inhabited by little blue beings ,they only have three apples high.
it lies deep in an enchanted forest, hidden away beyond a medieval village.
most people believe this place is made up, only to be found in books or in children's imaginations.
well, we beg to differ.
Yeah! Come on, Farmer!
I'm going in!
all right, Greedy, I'm gonna race you!
Yes!
whoa, golly! Farm boys love to fly!
Oh, yeah! So excited!
now you see us, now you don't!
three, two, one. Yeah!
Yeah! I love smurf berries! Hey, hey! The blue ones are mine!
blue MOON FESTIVAL.
Oh, no! I'm late for rehearsal! I am so late!
in Smurf village, each and every Smurf plays their own special pad.
whoa, Nellie! Sorry, Handy!
no problem, Clumsy. You keep me employed !
which gives the Smurfs a sense of harmony.
Hey, Baker! Nice pies! No worries, Clumsy.
and tranquility. Great sign, guys!
whether it's Handy Smurf the builder I can't stay. Rehearsal time!
Baker Smurf. Hey, Narrator Smurf!
Hello, Clumsy! Just rehearsing the intro for the Blue Moon Festival!
pizza! Pardon me! Pardon me! Hey, Chef Smurf!
Clumsy! Help!
I just invented frozen pizzas! Genius!
Smurf on the loose!
Hey, Clumsy. Hey, guys!
Hi, Jokey! Hi, Clumsy.
who's clumsy now, huh?
Hey, what do you get when you cross a Smurf with a cow?
blue cheese! I got you a present.
no, thanks, Jokey. I'm late for rehearsal!
but, wait! I...
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your roll, sailor.
Hey, wait, wait. Isn't that the rehearsal for the Blue Moon Festival?
what can I say, Clumsy? You're not on the list.
grouchy, it's right there.
right. Under "Do not let in Clumsy.
clearly you two lack the verbal skills required to explain this predicament succinctly. Hey!
here we go. You see, Clumsy, the other Smurfs don't want to dance with you for fear of what are politely called "fractures.
how could anybody think that?
that's gonna leave a big blue bruise.
wonderful! Beautiful! Marvelous.
watch it, there!
cut! Cut! Cut! It's a dance, not dominoes.
a worry line! All right, don't get your petals in a twist.
as happy and as perfect as life in Smurf village is, even sunshine and butterflies must have their dark clouds.
and for all Smurfs, that dark cloud has one name.
Gargamel, the evil wizard.
la la la la la la Sing a happy song
la la la la la la This is so wrong "I'm Papa Smurf.
I'm the head of a small group of blue people "and live in the forest with ninety-nine sons and one daughter.
nothing weird about that, no, no. Totally normal.
Oh, and I'm Smurfette. And I think I'm so pretty.
and I betrayed Gargamel, and I don't even care.
and everything is just sunshine and rainbows.
but all of that is about to change.
I said, "All of that is about to change." Azrael, that's your cue!
that's your cue to pounce on the miserable beasts in some kind of a rage-induced feline frenzy.
Yes, good. Yeah. More rage.
Hey, but don't go crazy. These are the only puppets I have.
I am not obsessed with Smurfs, thank you.
I simply can't stop thinking about the miserable beasts every single minute of every single day.
cause I need them!
it is only by capturing the little wretches and extracting their happy blue essence that my magic will finally become...
not infallible.
invincible! Yes. Thank you.
I shall become the most powerful wizard in all of the world.
Yeah, but you're milking it. Don't milk it.
Oh, great one?
Yes, lying, deceptive, horrible little Smurfette?
after all your years of Smurf-less searching, how ever do you expect to find us?
I'm very glad you asked, my dear.
for, you see, I have a magical map that shows me exactly where the smurf root grows!
I shall now use my formidable powers to magically transport us here!
come, my little fish-breathed friend!
Alakazoop!
great.
ye gods, Azrael. You're a boy?
we really need that Smurf essence.
Alakazamp!
now tie it off right there!
that blue moon time of year again.
time to smurf some magic.
summon a vision and see what our future holds.
I must get the visioning potion just right.
the magic is always strongest during the blue moon.
so far, so good. Lots of smiles and smurf berries.
Clumsy's sitting still. That's always good.
a dragon wand.
I got it! I got it!
clumsy.
help! Save us! Papa!
Papa!
clumsy, what have you done?
Hey, Papa. Clumsy?
are you okay?
Yes. Fine.
why aren't you rehearsing for the Blue Moon celebration?
you know. A couple guys got smacked in the face, so I thought I'd make some smurf root mud packs to take down everyone's swelling.
Papa, you're smurf out of smurf root. I'll go pick some.
No! Those fields are too close to Gargamel's castle.
I'll get the smurf root.
you stay in the village and out of trouble. Do you understand?
okay. If you say so.
a vision's never been wrong. I can't let this happen to my Smurfs.
just stay in the village, Clumsy.
look at all this smurf root. They are gonna be so proud of me.
let's see, just a few more...
boo. Gargamel!
help!
good kitty. Good kitty. Look! Look!
a ball of yarn!
a nice, juicy bird!
so, that's it!
it's invisible.
those sneaky... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
we don't know if it's safe.
Azrael?
are you dead?
so, what did you see in your vision, Papa?
nothing apocalyptic, really.
everything's going to be just fine.
perfect. Another year we don't have to worry about that mean, old...
Gargamel! I know who she meant, Clumsy.
no, no! Gargamel!
I accidentally led him to the village.
Gargamel!
Smurf for your lives!
everybody skedaddle!
into the forest, Smurfs! Come on, Clumsy!
sound the alarm, Crazy.
this is really bad!
Smurfs, that way!
Hey, cat! Azrael, over here! Come on!
there you go, you nasty cat.
this way! This is no joke!
look out! Papa!
emergency SMURF BERRIES
let go! Cursed nature!
here comes papa, Papa!
Papa, your primitive little defenses, they're useless against me, sir!
I laugh at them.
how's that for primitive, Gargamel?
maybe this will all blow over.
I can fix this. I just gotta think.
Yes!
follow me, everyone!
do NOT GO THIS WAY
save yourselves!
Clumsy! You're going the wrong way!
he's headed for the Forbidden Falls! With the blue moon coming?
quickly, Smurfs! Stop him! Unbelievable!
the one time we want him to trip and he's running perfectly!
Clumsy! Oh, this is a predicament.
agony AHEAD Anybody reading these signs?
especially IN A BLUE MOON This is a predicament! oh, This guy's killing me!
looks like we're down to 99 Smurfs!
this is not good at all.
Clumsy!
help!
well, we tried. Let's go.
hold on, We'll form a Smurf bridge to get you.
not the Smurf bridge!
there we go. Yeah, pardon me.
this is not a Smurf bridge, it's clearly a chain...
Smurf it, Brainy!
the blue moon! Oh, dear.
what's happening, Papa? What the blinking flip is that?
Oh, no!
the vision! Come on, guys!
pull him up! Hurry!
don't let go! Help!
help!
look out for the hole!
no, it's more of a vortex. Of a portal.
Smurf up! It's a hole.
hold on!
Oh, no!
looks like you got the short end of the stick, eh, Papa?
now you belong to me!
not this time, Gargamel!
what's wrong with you?
that was great! Let's have another go.
are you smurfed? We almost died in there!
we're not even wet.
what part of the enchanted forest is this?
my calculations indicate...
that's slimy.
I don't think we're in Smurf village any more.
Oh, my God.
Smurfs? You may Want to take a look at this. What is it?
why are we listening to him? He just got us sucked through a giant hole.
it's not a hole, it's a vortex.
and can't we just go around the rock?
Oh, my smurf.
where the smurf are we?
up the smurfing creek without a paddle, that's where.
well, at least they're not coming after us.
Oh, yeah. Really?
Oh, dear. Azrael!
run! Not again!
Azrael? Are you dead?
must have Smurfs!
we'll circle back when it's safe! Run!
guys, come on! Go!
coming through! I'm getting hungry!
Hey, how are you? Yeah, nice to see you. Enjoy the party.
Hey, can we get the photographer over there?
there's big arrivals happening. Thanks. Welcome.
Hey, ladies, looking good. A couple quick, quick tips.
if you could not stand directly in front of the display, but over to the sides, it'd be a bit more visible. Hey, look, product.
also, don't forget to smile.
remember, you're working for a cosmetics company. That's it.
smile, relax, everyone will have a good time. Let's go!
Thanks. Thank you so much.
Hello, Henri.
on top of everything with the campaign, Patrick?
well, as much as I can be.
we certainly did our homework. We tested the results.
Patrick!
she's pointing at me. That can't be good.
Odile, it looks fantastic for Thursday's launch.
it's gonna be quite the gala.
there he is. My new vice president of marketing.
so, wait, you fired Ralph? His campaign was rubbish.
he gave me what I asked for, not what I want.
can you give me what I want?
is that what you're asking for?
how would I know what I'm asking for when I don't even know what I want?
well said, Odile. Well said. That's why you need me.
I need you to create a new campaign for Jouvenel.
all digital, of course, so it can be ready on time for the launch.
Odile, that's two days.
So,it mustn't be delayed. Is that going to be a problem?
no. No, I mean for a whole new campaign, it's kind of tight.
but... No, two days is perfect.
I mean,God only needed six days for the whole world, right?
fail me, and maybe you can go and work for him.
where are we, Azrael?
what manner of freakish realm is this?
okay, one more box of research. Hey, would you get a cab for me, please?
Yes, yes, of course.
this day just keeps getting better and better.
so we're just gonna jump in the portal, get back to our village and everybody's happy, right?
Yeah, guys. Let's stay smurftimistic.
you know what? I choose to be pessismurfstic.
we're all gonna die.
Papa Smurf, how do we get home with the portal closed?
I'm sure when the blue moon rises tonight, the portal will open again.
now, let's take shelter till dark.
all right, let's get smurfing.
okay, but I'm not happy.
Azrael! Run, Smurfs!
take that! Guys, come on!
quick, to the tree! Let's go!
Smurfette! My hair! Get back, cat!
way to go, Smurfette!
Oh, no! Take one for the team, Clumsy!
help! Clumsy, look out!
Smurf!
Clumsy! Oh, no!
Hey.
Clumsy! What a numptie.
quickly, to the mechanical wagon. Up the tree, Smurfs.
why don't we just go around the tree?
there you are. By all means, relax here in the fresh air and the sunshine while my missing Smurfs could be anywhere.
what? Where?
come on! Try and stay with me, Smurfs.
I'm getting too old for this. Slow down!
be careful, Brainy.
Hey. Hey!
seventh Street, from First and A, please.
come on, Smurfs! I don't like these heights.
don't look down. Come back here, wretched Smurfs!
Hurry! We're way up here!
a jump from this height will Knock the blue out of us!
my hip. Papa!
Gargamel! Oh, dear.
stop that carriage! Let's go! Let's go!
wait, wait. I forgot my phone. Come back! Stop there!
stop that carriage!
never mind. Here it is.
knock yourself out, Gargamel!
you've had that coming for about 30 years!
Smurfs!
Oh, wow.
castles and palaces everywhere!
and green goblins! And red trolls.
and look at the giant princess!
this village is amazing, Papa.
Yes, and likely very dangerous.
until we rescue Clumsy and get back home,
I need you all to stay close and do exactly as I say.
Smurf's honor. If you say so.
you can count on us, Papa.
they can see us! Camouflage.
blend in.
well, I guess this is our stop. Let's go.
we get to climb another tree.
watch out, watch out. Hang on, everybody. Hang on!
brainy. That's it.
thanks a lot. Have a good night. I hope Clumsy can breathe in that box.
how are we supposed to find Clumsy in there?
I could attempt to smurf the probability... Brainy!
we'll look through every window. I don't do windows.
now, let's get smurfing. You heard him. Come on.
every window? Piece of cake.
grace? Hello?
guess what? Guess what, guess what?
okay. They invented a zero-calorie pizza.
no, but that's a good idea. Yes. They found...
baby kicked.
Hi.
please say hello.
what?
please. Hello, little Sea-Monkey.
this is the sound of my voice.
Hello, son or daughter. Hello.
hello.
that is not the sound of your voice. That is the voice of a robot.
our child is gonna be attached to the toaster.
or the new VP of marketing.
no. No! Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my gosh!
it's... It's provisional.If I can satisify Odile, then I'll keep the job.
if not, then my head'll be on a pike next to the last guy.
well, You owned me.
but I have two days.
Oh, I know.
what if I don't get them done in time?
you can't come to the ultrasound.
unless...
wait, the backup ads we have did fine in focus groups.
I could retool those. I'd have to work around the clock.
azrael, we've come so far, yet ever am I haunted by the same familiar riddle.
how to find the Smurfs?
if only I...
I'm sorry, is my thinking interrupting your vile hacking?
if only I had something of theirs. A drop of spittle. A fingernail.
some hair, even. Then I could make some Smurf magic.
very nice. Are you done now?
I don't want to look at it.
what?
is that... No. No, it can't be.
it is.
the tawny locks of Smurfette.
sweet follicular ambrosia! Silky strands of joy.
mixed with a fair amount of cat vomit.
Yes. Yes, I am a genius!
with my skills, even this small trifle of smurfiness will yield me just enough power to catch them all!
I must find a laboratory with which to tease the magic from these precious little strands.
Yes. It's a bit small, but this should do nicely!
it's even got its own cauldron.
what died in here?
open. Open. Open. Open. Open!
somebody's been working a dark and terrible magic in there.
what is that?
baby.
daddy is home.
come on.
Papa, I'm familiar with 613 shades of blue, and that moon is not one of them. Papa?
stay calm, everyone. If the portal opened once, it can open again.
how are we gonna open a magical portal when we can't even find Clumsy?
Hey, I think I see something up there.
Oh, no.
clumsy? Is that you?
hello.
help! Help!
Oh, smurf.
Hey.
berry Boom.
Patrick!
No! no! no!
Elway. Elway.
I'm sure this is the box. When I get my hands on him...
someone's coming! Smurfs!
what is it?
no, no!
no, no, no, no. Come on, come on, come on. Please, please.
Elway.
Elway. Did you do that?
come on, put a little smurf into it. Hang on, Clumsy.
I got this side. All together now.
crikey. Oh, dear.
now what, lads? What happened to Clumsy?
I bet they ate him. Let's go home. Hide.
go! Pull the lid!
gross.
this is so...
that's Clumsy! Charge, Smurfs! Charge!
out of the way, big guy. Clumsy, we're coming!
excuse me. Pardon me.
this is for Clumsy! Wait for me!
Oh, God! Please don't hurt me!
please, I just want to go home! Are you...
did you just talk?
I'm not saying till you put down the giant spiky thing.
Clumsy! Clumsy, where are you?
make yourself known! Smurf us a sign!
come out, Clumsy! Smurf out, smurf out, wherever you are.
are you there? Come to my voice, laddie!
where are you? Can you hear us?
get out of here! Look out!
too much aggression! Go back to the sewers!
kiss my smurf!
you all find Clumsy! The giant is mine!
over here! Get him!
have you had enough? Tap out?
okay, so you're like... You're blue, and...
Oh, gosh, are you okay? Quickly!
this way! This way! Follow me, Smurfs!
Clumsy! Where are you? Look out!
other way! Other way!
run, Smurfs! Come on!
run!
Elway!
Smurf for your lives! Clumsy, where the smurf are you?
stinky breath. Spread out!
grace! Run!
stop bleating like a sheep and let me hog-tie you, you wriggly numptie.
grace, we're being attacked!
do not be fooled by their cuteness!
it's okay, it's okay.
they're friendly.
you're lucky your lassie stepped in.
I was about to make haggis with your innards.
this is it. This is it, Azrael!
Smurfette's hair goes in here, flows through the Smurf essence extractor, and finally, I have my Smurfilator!
it's so excited!
would you care for a mint when you're done?
Yes, yes, yes!
with this precious elixir, my sorcerous spell shall be powerful beyond all measurable measurement.
this one tiny drop will give me the power to capture them all.
la la la la la la Sing a happy song
this is great!
la la la la la la Smurf the whole day long
next time you're feeling blue Just let a smile begin
happy things will come to you So Smurf yourself a grin
it's so obvious that what you're doing is wrong.
Oh, really?
how crazy is this?
there are little blue people singing in our kitchen!
so you're sticking with your "this is actually happening" theory?
sorry.
okay. It says here Smurfs are mythical creatures from Belgium, also known as Schtroumpfs... Yeah.
documented by Peyo.
also says that they bring good luck. Like leprechauns to the Irish.
it says they're mythical, Grace.
I'm so sorry, Master Winslow. That was great.
well, they look pretty real to me.
come on.
excuse me. Okay, to review.
you guys come from a magic forest where you live in oversized mushrooms.
Yes. You're being chased by an evil wizard.
Yeah. And you're trapped in New York until there's a blue moon... Very good.
and you like to use the extremely imprecise term "smurf"
for just about everything. Smurfxactly.
and you're all named after your personalities?
do you get your names when you're born, or after you've exhibited certain traits?
Yeah. Yep.
Yeah, whatever.
master Winslow, there must be something about the blue moon on your magic window machine.
just what is this magic searching device?
right now, I'm using Google.
google. Google.
okay. "Blue moon. A full moon that occurs twice in one month.
a figurative construct...
much like yourselves. Hey!
but the moon itself doesn't appear to be blue.
what? Not blue?
perfect! Now we'll never get home!
no cause for alarm, my little Smurfs. If we're to open the portal home,
I'll just have to smurf us a potion to invoke the blue moon.
you hear that, honey?
they're only staying till an actual blue moon rises.
which could happen if the little blue Santa man makes a magic potion, which, at this point, seems completely plausible.
want a bite? No, thank you.
of course, the stars will need to be perfectly aligned.
and when that might be is hard to determine without the proper instrument.
master Winslow, might I borrow your stargazer?
what? My what?
he doesn't have a Stargazer. Do you?
this is all my fault.
we're all gonna die! we're all gonna die!
one Panicky Smurf is enough! Hey!
besides, Papa had a vision, and everything turns out smurfy.
right, Papa?
Yes, yes. It all turns out just fine.
we must find this Smurf thief. Stop your complaining.
if I were a Smurf, where would I go?
you there, you there. Fancy pants. Have you seen any little blue men?
Absolutely. What price are we talking about? You're selling them?
have you looked in the drawer, sweetie? Wait, what drawer?
in the kitchen, Lilly. Who is this Lilly?
are you kidding? She's the hottest girl in my department.
please, please. Please, young woodsman.
what does the temperature of this Lilly have to do with the finding of Smurfs?
take your meds, man. What?
is everyone in this realm completely insane?
thank the gods, a local wizard. Excellent.
pardon me, wise sir?
by any chance, have you seen any little blue men?
they're everywhere!
I knew it. I knew it! I told you we were close, Azrael.
I know.
now, just take one, everybody. We have to make sure our smurf berries last.
great. We're gonna be here how long?
not long. First, we have to get a Stargazer.
next, find a book of spells and then smurf a portal and we're home. Very simple, my little Smurfs.
I have to go, Elway.
someone looks smurfalish!
why you wearing a leash? It's a tie.
does it keep your neck warm? No.
clearly, it functions as an aid in his craft, like a blacksmith's apron.
I wear it because it's what everyone wears at work.
what are you, you pasty giant?
I try to get people to buy things by analyzing market trend predictions.
Predictions! He's a fortune teller.
look, I would love to explain but I am super late. I gotta go.
I really don't have time for this. What?
you had one outfit on, and now you're wearing something completely different.
Yeah. It... Now, Smurfette, she probably got the other one dirty.
let's not embarrass her. Sorry.
thanks for letting us stay in your mushroom, Miss Grace.
it's really nice. Well, thank you. I'm glad you like it.
I like our little mushroom, too. But you know, somebody wants a bigger mushroom.
but, then you'd be further apart.
you said it, sister. Okay, I've gotta go. I've got an appointment.
I've got a baby on the way, so...
wait, wait. We can't just leave them here alone, without an adult.
I'm 546 years old.
of course you are.
they'll be fine. They'll be fine. All right.
Byebye, Love you. Okay.
Bye. Bye. Bye, Grace! Goodbye.
by the way, I wouldn't go anywhere if I were you.
why not?
our world doesn't do well with visitors from other places.
I mean, look what happened to E. T.
it's a movie. A moving picture.Book.
just stay at hone, okay?
okay, He's gone and we still don't have a Stargazer.
wait a smurf. If he's a fortune teller, he reads stars all the time.
ergo, it's at his place of business.
excellent work, Brainy.
what are we waiting for? Let's ride.
Yeah, come on, guys. Hey, stop it.
come on, Smurfs! Let's go get that Stargazer.
surprise, surprise. Oh, no.
clumsy, I think it might be best if you stay here. You know?
you know,Smurf an eye on the mushroom.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
this way, Smurfs! Let's follow Mr. Winslow.
well, I can smurf an eye on the mushroom.
let's smurf this jointï¼
Smurf awayï¼Is he down there?
