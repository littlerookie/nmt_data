smart, funny, kind.
I don't hear the word "love" in there.
well, that's a big word.
we just started dating, and we have a connection, and I'm gonna follow it throug hand see where it goes.
Oh, I get it. You're gonna string him along till you feel something you don't and waste the next five years of your life.
as opposed to the 12 I wasted on you?
why are we talking about this?
I don't recall asking you your opinion.
because we're married and I have certain rights, and one of the mis the right to badger you.
okay, you know, you can leave now.
I wish I could M.R.I. Your soul
out!
it's not funny.
Hey, watch out for my wife. She's on a tear.
Oh, here's one we took on vacation.
hmm. Gaby, these pictures have to be wholesome.
they gotta say...
these people will do a great job raising a child.
so?
so you're topless.
Yeah, but it's st. Barts, and your hands are covering my naughty parts.
do you mean the hand that's holding the tequila shot, or the one that's holding the cuban cigar?
Yeah, that was a good trip.
fine. We won't use it. - We can't use any of 'em.
every single picture of the two of us, we're either drinking or smoking or naked.
so we like to have fun. I mean, who doesn't understand that better than an unwed, knocked-up teenager?
this is serious.
if we can't sell ourselves as good people...
well, then we'll just have to find someone who can do it for us.
so you want me to, uh...
pitch you as parents?
you're in advertising. You can do it.
just write us a character reference saying we're great with kids.
Oh, this is for you.
Oh. Well, you don't have to bribe me.
we're all friends here.
keeping that in mind, would it also be okay if we were your kids' god parents?
Oh! Uh... I guess.
great, and can we take some fake pictures to document it?
I don't suppose you brought a corkscrew?
you didn't have a warrant, and if you don't arrest him, then you gotta tell me what he wants.
Hello, Mike.
Felicia, what are you doing here?
Oh, I left in such a rush.
there was a lot of old business I forgot to wrap up.
well, it must be pretty important business, gets you to move back in next door to the man you think murdered your sister.
it's funny you should mention Paul.
you know, the police came and took him away last night.
the police?
and from the way they were manhandling him, ooh, I don't think he'll be back anytime soon.
no, I just wanna talk to him, that's all...
what the hell's going on?
it's none of your concern, Mike.
you listen to me, if anything happens to Paul Young
it already happened.
hours ago.
he's dead?
like I said, it's none of your concern.
maybe you don't get it, Noah. You screwed up.
you just killed the most important person in your grandson's life.
do you think he's gonna have anything to do with you once he finds out?
and believe me,
I'll make sure he finds out.
so, honey, the meat loaf--it's, um, it's a little burnt.
Oh, right, I was talking to Susan on the phone, and I left it in a little longer than I should've. Sorry.
it's okay.
is it that bad?
no. No, not bad at all.
Oh, good.
Parker, don't put your elbows on the table. Come on.
but you'd agree it wasn't your best effort.
huh?
the meal, the task you agreed to take on.
you'd agree that you didn't give it 100%, right?
Tom, if you're gonna make a point, why don't you do it now before I hurl the plate at you?
nobody gives 100% of his effort all the time because they can't.
it is impossible.
you do the best you can with the time and energy you have.
stop right there. This is meat loaf.
your presentation was business.
you're saying the client deserves more effort than your own family?
okay.
so if I apologize for upsetting you at work, can we get past it and enjoy our meal?
Absolutely.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am sorry.
Thanks.
so, boys, how do you enjoy the meat loaf?
it's a little salty.
Yeah.
just eat it.
there.
perfect.
all right.
all right, one more time.
what?
Yeah.
dude, I don't wanna mess up your face.
do you love me?
then do what I tell you.
rough day.
Yeah.
I wonder if there's any way that we can turn it around still.
good question.
but what to do? What to do?
Yeah.
Hi! What's up?
why do you keep trying to do that?
what? - Trying to get on top.
of you? No, I'm not.
you were pushing on me like you were trying to sack me.
I felt it.
are you serious?
Tom, I wasn't doing anything. I was just going for it.
I was just lost in the moment. Oh, come on!
come on, this is silly. I don't wanna argue.
I mean, unless it turns you on.
does it? 'Cause then I'm all about it, baby.
what -- what was that?
what -- what was what?
you were bracing.
you were bracing with your leg.
I was trying to lie on top of you, and you were bracing yourself against the mattress so you didn't have to get on your back.
try and deny it. Try and deny it. You can't.
okay, okay, can I just mention you're talking like a crazy person?
you can't give it up for a second, can you?
you always have to call the shots. Always.
is this about me being boss again?
you gotta get over it.
that's exactly my point.
exactly.
you are not just my boss at the office.
you're my boss everywhere.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
you run the show.
you run the show, and I'm along for the ride.
I just push the little shopping cart, let the woman do all the driving.
Tom... - I'm the caddy husband.
I carry your clubs.
I am so sorry you feel that way, but you cannot put that on me.
this is your life.
you wanna run it?
then step on up.
you wanna drive?
grab the steering wheel.
I mean-- what else am I supposed to say?
I'm gonna check on the kids.
time to check your blood pressure.
Oh, sure.
Oh, that's a little tight. Does it have to be that tight?
Yes. - Oh.
okay. Ow, ow. That's actually starting to be painful.
Really? That surprises me.
I just assumed you were dead inside.
Ow! Ow! What the hell are you doing?
I told myself to stay out of this, but I can't.
I know that you're married.
I am not!
Really? Hmm,'cause that man that came to see you yesterday, he said you're his wife.
Oh! Yeah, oh...
no, no, he just said that 'cause we used to be married.
it's just a force of habit.
Oh, that explains everything.
except that I checked your insurance forms, and you're still married.
so that makes you a lying, adulterous skank.
Oh, no. No, no. No, no, nurse Hisel.
ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow, nurse Hisel!
Ugh! Nurse--oh!
nurse Hisel, I can explain.
can you, skank?
Yes. Okay.
I am married, but it's only because my insurance ran out.
my ex-husband has a really good coverage plan, so he said that he would remarry me so I could get my operation.
only I didn't wanna tell Dr. Ron 'cause I didn't want him to be an accomplice to fraud.
so you're what...
protecting him?
Yeah. It -- yes, I am.
okay.
as long as you're not two-timing him.
he feels so strongly about you.
I know. I read the card.
but did you read between the lines?
what do you mean?
okay, I shouldn't be telling you this, but when we were picking out the flowers for you, he said that he was working up the courage to say he loves you.
Really?
Yes!
but you have to act surprised, okay?
Oh, yeah, I'll be surprised.
so I guess we have the whole insurance thing worked out.
Oh! Pfft. Don't worry about that. Please.
who am I to cast stones?
I mean, heck...
I didn't pass my nurse's exam.
they didn't even ask me!
Andrew, did I hear the bell?
Oh, hello.
I'm Samuel Bormanis. I'm here to see Andrew.
Oh, okay. Are you a friend of Andrew's?
I'm his lawyer.
his lawyer? Well, why on earth would Andrew need a lawyer?
here you go, Sam.
honey, what happened to-- to your face?
I...
you hit me.
don't you remember?
for the record, I did not punch my son.
I slapped him with an open palm.
Yeah, but, mom, the thing is, when you drink, you don't know your own strength.
this is ridiculous.
can't you see this is a performance?
Mrs. Van de Kamp, I've heard enough.
clearly, this environment is a highly dysfunctional one.
andrew has retained my services in order to pursuea healthier living situation.
and what might that be?
I, um, I wanna be emancipated.
emancipated?
as an emancipated minor, Andrew would be able to live on his own.
he'd still go to school, of course, but he'd be released from all adult supervision.
well, that's the silliest thing I've ever heard of.
how would he support himself?
well, he'd be in complete control of his own finances.
so that's what this is about--your trust fund?
obviously, we'd all prefer not to go to family court, but with the violence and your D. U.I. Charge, it could get ugly.
uh, Mr. Bormanis,
I'll need a little time to think about this.
you have 24 hours.
boy, it really looks like we're having a good time.
I sure hope this works.
well, as long as they don't make me play guitar,
I think we're home free.
Mr. And Mrs. Solis, Rhoda can see you now.
Wow!
it looks like you spend lots of time with these kids.
Oh, we take our roles as god parents very seriously.
don't we, honey? - Mm-hmm. Yes.
Oh, they're precious. What are their names?
Parker and, uh...
porter, uh...
and, uh...
well, they're all p'S. It is super cute.
one sec. Do you need me, Helen?
Hello, Gabrielle.
I didn't know you were adopting.
the other one's name is Preston.
Helen, you work here?
you all know each other?
what a small world. It sure is.
Mrs. Solis hired my son to do her yard work.
and also, she would rape him.
okay, first of all, it was statutory, and it happened so long ago.
was it? I think it was only about a year ago.
no, it was a year, because it was right before your husband went to prison on slave labor charges.
rhoda, if you don't mind,
I think I'll handle the Solis case myself.
I'd like to make it my top priority. Okay.
Oh, and, um, Gabrielle, don't bother trying to contact any other adoption agencies in the area.
I'll make sure they know all about you.
I think I have to break up with Dr. Ron.
what? Why?
because he's a gem.
and apparently he loves me.
I'm sorry. I'm not following.
Lynette, he is everything
I could possibly want in a boyfriend, and I just don't know if I feel that...
spark.
you know, and I really want to.
Aw, sweetie.
and he keeps telling me how special I am and how muchI mean to him...
how he wants to hold my beating heart in his hand.
maybe it's because I just haven't felt that thunderbolt yet.
you know, with Mike, it hit me. With Harl, it hit me.
I didn't have to worry about how I felt because the thunderbolt told me.
Yeah, yeah. Gotta love the thunderbolt.
do I, though? I mean, I do
but I don't trust it anymore.
you know, those relationships turned out to be disasters.
maybe I should stick it out with Dr. Ron, and I should try heading down a road that's growing and slower into a sort of kind of love that would sustain itself for 50 years. Right?
stability, comfort, endurance -- I deserve that.
Oh, yes! Of course you do.
still, you gotta love the thunderbolt.
that's not helpful.
sorry.
Ah, this is a sign.
will you shut up?
we lost a baby, found out we can't conceive another one, and ran into Helen Rowland at an adoption agency.
God is obviously trying to tell us something.
Carlos, we're catholics, okay?
God is pretty johnny one note on the whole subject of procreation.
Hey, and will you stop with this defeatist attitude?
okay, do you want a baby or not?
I think it's time that we faced reality
we're bad people, and we probably don't even deserve to be parents.
well, then who the hell does?
I mean, look at all the idiots popping kids.
okay, they're not any more qualified than we are.
I don't know.
look, Carlos...
it doesn't matter what we've done in our past.
being a parent means rising to the occasion, and that's exactly what we're gonna do when we bring our baby home.
this is the first time I really felt like you wanted to have a baby.
well, this is the first time someone told me I couldn't have one.
okay, so what are we gonna do?
I mean, no adoption agencyis gonna touch us now.
there are ways to get babies, Carlos.
it just might cost us.
I have some contacts in the police department.
I've been making calls, but I can't seem to get a straight answer about your dad.
I don't understand. How do they just lose somebody?
they don't, not by accident.
but I don't think what happened to your dad was an accident.
what's that supposed to mean?
Mrs. Tillman.
Hello, Zachary. You look terrible.
Oh, Mr. Delfino.
isn't this just a picture?
Felicia, why are you here?
young Zachary and I didn't exactly part on the best of terms.
in fact, when the weather's damp,
I'm still reminded of our last good-bye.
but forgive and forget. That's my motto.
macaroon?
dad!
you all right?
now how did you know I love macaroons?
it won't end here, you know. Noah Taylor doesn't give up.
look, don't worry about us. We'll be gone by morning.
no, it's too late for that now.
I guarantee he's got people watching you.
what is it with you anyway?
first, you want me to run.
now you want us to stick around like sitting ducks for this maniac.
go ahead, run. Noah's got the cops in his pocket.
so I'm a dead man.
maybe not.
not if we use what leverage we have.
no way.
the old man's gonna be dead in a couple of months, maybe less.
let him meet Zach, - play the doting grandfather-- - I said forget it.
I'll do it.
if it mean she'll leave us alone,
I'm ready to be leveraged.
nicholson will be coming in in about 15 minutes with a pitch, so let's grab everybody and make sure we're all on the same page.
hang on a second.
what's going on?
I need to say this.
Ah, yeah...
I have been giving you a lot of grief lately about being the boss.
but it's just hard for a guy to feel like he's not in charge of any part of his life.
but, honey, it goes back and forth.
I know. But it just feels a little one-sided lately, and sometimes I need to drive the train.
but, look, I know it is my issue.
it's my issue, and I will step up and deal with it.
Mmm.
whoa. Hello.
what's going on, huh?
I'm picking up where we left off Last night.
Oh, I get it. I get it.
Ooh! This is your idea of driving the train.
and it's very manly and really impressive, but it's really, really bad timing.
you can't be serious.
Mmm. We're gonna--we're gonna be late.
Yeah, we are going to be late.
okay.
there is nothing more important than family.
and I think it's so unfair some are denied their god-given right to parent just because of a fews or did incidents in their past.
now
I may have to explore some unconventional paths to find your child.
I might even have to take action some might view as unsavory.
but before I do...
I need proof that the two of you are prepared to face the challenges ahead.
20000
is that proof enough for you?
Yes, it is.
nice to meet you, young man.
I'm not gonna hug you.
I don't care if you are my grandfather.
Ah. That's okay. Hugging's not really my thing.
Mike, could you wait outside?
I'd like to be alone with Zachary.
not a chance.
just curious...
why was it so important you see me?
you're my grandson.
my flesh and blood.
isn't it only natural I'd want a relationship with you?
what kind of relationship can we have when I know you tried to kill my dad?
surely, you can understand the rage I must feel towards your father.
go ahead. Feel all the rage you wanna feel.
but if anything happens to him,
I swear to god you are never gonna see me again.
you only met me two minutes ago, and here you are, already blackmailing me.
I couldn't be prouder.
I'm serious.
I want you to swear you're not gonna do anything to my dad.
which dad?
you have two of 'em.
you know who I'm talking about
my dad, the man who raised me, the only man I'm ever gonna care about.
so swear.
I swear.
well, now that the ground rules have been set, who's up for some meaningless small talk?
well, if it isn't the plumber.
you here to see Susan?
uh, yeah, I just wanted to talk to her before her operation.
Oh? You're cutting it kind a close.
she's just about to be wheeled into surgery.
you know, she's dating her surgeon.
Yeah, she told me.
you met him?
Yeah.
he's, like, 6 years old.
those for her?
Yeah. The florist was having a sale on lilacs.
Dr. Ron just bought her the biggest bouquet of roses you've ever seen.
it was disgusting.
and the note that went with it made my teeth hurt, it was so saccharin.
he used words like"soul mate" and "eternity."
I almost puked in the vase.
What'd Susan think about that?
well, she seemed to be really into it.
Oh, wait, stop! Go back!
stop! Stop a second.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I just, uh, wanted to wish you luck before your surgery.
Aw, that's so sweet.
you came all the way down here just for me.
Yep. That's why I came.
Oh, it means a lot to me that you came.
well, you take care, Susan.
okay.
Bye.
you forgot to give her your flowers.
Ah, it's no big deal.
Hi, Susan.
how are those drugs working for you? You feeling good?
super-duper. How you feeling?
well, um, you know I want you to know, what I said the other day
that corny stuff about me holding your heart in my hands
well, what I meant to say was, my feelings for you--they keep growing, and, uh, I think
well, I hope that you feel the same way about me. Mm.
Ah, hell, Susan.
I love you.
Aw, thank you.
I love Mike.
Susan, who's Mike?
Mike is love. Mmm.
who the hell is Mike?
I don't know, but she's married to a guy named Karl.
I'm so, so sorry. I should've told you, Dr. Ron.
Oh, why are you always falling in love with skanks?
you beautiful, beautiful man!
Oh!
okay, we ready to go here?
Yeah. Sure.
let's cut this bitch open.
what are you doing?
your lawyer left a message on my machine.
it seems we have a hearing in four weeks, and I wanna be ready.
Oh, I get it.
so, uh, so you're gonna pretend to be sober for the judge?
Oh, there's no pretending.
I am going to my first A. A. Meeting tomorrow.
of course, I picked one in the worst part of town so I won't run into anybody I know.
which, of course, means I will.
all right, so what is that gonna prove?
perception is reality, Andrew.
and if people perceive me to have a drinking problem, then I do.
and I certainly don't want some idiotic judge using my hobby as an excuse to make you rich.
so I'm simply going to give up my wine and become a recovering alcoholic.
good plan, but it'll never work.
see, I'll bet you still end up coming to court hammered.
Oh, Andrew, you don't think I love you enough to give up alcohol?
look, I'm 17, all right?
so you can only keep me here for another year.
why not just let me go?
because I'm not done with you yet.
it's my job to teach you, and you are not half the man I know you can be.
Yeah, well, I got news for you
this is as good as I'm gonna get.
if I really thought that,
I'd get a gun right now and kill us both.
mom, we're both so unhappy.
why not just let me take my trust fund, and I'll get out of your hair forever?
please.
you're a stone cold bitch, you know that?
I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.
I hate you.
you know, the opposite of love isn't hate.
it's indifference.
and if you hate me, that means you still care, and we're still connected, and I still have a chance to set you right.
this is how Bree Van de Kamp finally came to change her weekly routine.
she still cleaned on Tuesdays...
paid her bills on Wednesdays...
and did her laundry on Thursdays.
but her Fridays were now reserved for a meeting...
a special meeting where she stood in front of people she didn't know...
my name is Bree, and I am an alcoholic.
and said things she didn't believe.
and afterwards, Bree would come home and reward herself...
on the completion of another successful week.
well, if Libby here likes us as much as we like her, we should just go ahead and move to adopt her baby girl. Who's the father?
honestly, I don't know.
Carlos and Gaby made a deal...
I did remarry my ex, but it was only because he has great health insurance. Susan made amends...
you know, I never thought I'd have such a good time hanging out with my girlfriend and her husband.
and Mike... didn't she mention we dated?
made a confession... Liar! You've just been leading me on!
you're obviously still in love with this guy!
on her first day of sobriety, Bree Van De Kamp found an old cork, which reminded her just how much she craved Chablis.
so she called her sponsor, who came over with a DVD which they watched till her craving had passed.
five days later, after she developed a thirst for Merlot, Peter arrived with a deck of cards.
the next week, he brought over Chinese takeout because Bree had told him she was consumed by thoughts of Vintage Chardonnay.
by her 20th day of sobriety, Bree had stopped thinking because her thoughts were now centered elsewhere.
Hmm...
Yeah, huh.
I'm curious, Peter.
what is the easiest way to overcome addiction?
Oh, some folks try shock therapy.
other use, uh, hypnosis.
but taking it one day at a time still makes the most sense to me.
what are you doing?
I was just giving you a little kiss.
Why?
well, it's just my way of saying thank you for everything you've done for me over the past few weeks.
what's... wrong?
this is gonna seem like it's coming out of left field, but in addition to being a recoveri alcoholic, I'm also a member of s. a.
sex Addicts anonymous.
Oh. And that's a... a real thing?
Yes. Sex is as much an addiction for me as booze.
that's why when you turn me on like that,
so... how long has it been since you...
a year.
they have this rule... plant, pet, person.
if I can keep a plant alive, you know, then I can move on to a pet.
and if I can make that work, then I can start dating again.
so how are you doing?
I'm on my fourth ficus.
Oh.
see?
I think you can handle affection better than you give yourself credit for.
Oh! Oh!
Oh!
Oh, oh!
I'm sorry.
um... I think I should go.
Really? Yeah.
Peter! But... but... you forgot your shirt!
keep it.
though she didn't know it, Bree had answered her own question.
the easiest way to overcome one addiction...
is to replace it with another.
temptation...
it's the name of a well-known establishment on the outskirts of Fairview.
its clientele is devoted.
everyone who goes there wants to get their hands on something.
and when they cross a line...
Hey! I warned you, pal.
they are punished...
as a certain married couple were about to discover.
Hi.
you want a lap dance?
uh...
no, thanks. No.
I sure hope Libby likes this camera.
well, why wouldn't she? It's exactly what she asked for, the most expensive one in the store.
what the hell are you guys doing here?
uh, we brought you this gift, and you said that you didn't want us coming by your house...
Thanks, but I'm working, so you gotta go.
look, we spent a lot of money on that.
the least you can do is open I so we can bask in your happy expression.
is there a problem here?
no, we're just talking. It's... everything's fine.
Carlos Solis. This is my wife, Gabrielle.
we're friends of Libby's.
Oh, hey, I'm Frank, Libby's boyfriend.
Libby, you didn't tell us you had a boyfriend.
didn't I? I thought I had.
what's that, a present for our baby?
I'm sorry, did you just say "our" baby?
Yeah. It's our first.
Hey!
what's for lunch?
omelettes. You want me to make you one?
no, thank you. I'll just pick at yours.
I didn't know you still had a key, dad.
you mean, two of your three favorite ladies.
you know, when you add in Edie.
right! Of course.
and speaking of Edie, I have some big news.
I finally did it. I popped the question.
Oh! Congratulations, dad!
yeah... congratulations.
um, what happened to waiting six months?
Edie and I aren't getting married tomorrow.
it takes months to plan a classy wedding, you know?
remember ours, hmm? You had to have it outdoors, huh?
Ugh. It poured.
I could have murdered that weatherman.
we were all crammed under this little gazebo thing. It was hysterical.
I thought the whole wedding day was ruined.
I loved it! It felt spontaneous.
all our friends gathered close around us, hmm?
remember?
you said it was the happiest day of your life.
just like you marrying Edie will be the happiest day of her life.
Yeah. Right.
her, too.
Toodles.
Oh, hi.
hello.
andrew said it was all right for me to get a cream soda.
uh, sure. Help yourself.
there's also frosted glasses in the freezer.
can is fine, but thank you.
Hi.
Hey.
I know that you're still angry with me, and, um...
I wanted to tell you that I have, um...
joined a recovery program.
A. a.
I just wanted you to know that...
and to tell you I'm sorry.
you are...
a real friend, and I value your honesty.
Oh, I don't wanna be mad anymore.
and I'm so happy to hear all that, and I am so proud of you. Oh, thanks, but I'm not really out of the woods yet.
I still have this whole court case hanging over my head.
I heard about that.
Andrew's asking to be emancipated?
Yes, and his lawyer is taking depositions now to see if iI am a fit parent.
Oy.
and considering that mishap that I had with your kids, I, uh, I imagine he'll be anxious to talk to you.
well, it makes sense, I guess.
Yeah.
do you have any idea what you might say?
I, um...
I'll focus on your good qualities.
I could not ask for anything more.
Thanks.
see you around, I hope. All right.
that's... not why you came to apologize, is it?
what do you mean?
to soften me up for the deposition.
of course not.
um...
I just want you to understand something.
andrew is making accusations...
false accusations, saying that I abused him, all because I wouldn't let him have his trust fund early so he could buy a car.
I mean, can you blame me for wanting to know if I have your support?
and...
so... what, you want me to lie? Make you look good?
I actually don't want anything of the sort.
good.
because when I give my deposition, I'm going to tell the truth.
to what do I owe this pleasure?
I want you to look at something.
MYRA holt is talking to Paul Young, chatting away with him as though he were any other neighbor.
now I told her he killed my sister.
I mentioned it to her six months ago when we were standing in the express line at the market.
but still, there she is, yakking away.
Oh, Mike.
I'm afraid people's memories aren't what they used to be.
what do you want, Felicia?
I wanna see how good your memory is, if you recall a certain promise you made to me.
I am not gonna kill him. Why not? Give me one good reason.
because things have changed.
how? My sister still lies rotting in the ground.
so does Dierdre. No, I don't see how anything's changed at all.
you're just gonna have to let this go.
sounds to me as though someone's let go of his rage.
maybe I have.
well, I haven't.
he clearly wants to keep the baby. Mr. Solis, if the father wants to assert his rights here, there's nothing we can do.
I'll find you another baby. I promise.
I don't want another baby. I want this one! Oh, honey, he's right, okay.
that trashy girl has been lying to us from the get-go.
let's just walk away while we can. It's not worth it.
look, don't get cold feet now, Gaby, please. All right?
let's just pay Frank the way we paid Libby and then bring the baby home. Wait, wait, wait...
you paid Libby?
you said we could give her gifts.
everybody loves getting cash.
I could probably be disbarred for even listening to this.
I cannot condone baby-buying!
and I sure as hell can't be part of it.
Oh, Mr. Beale, come on.
no, no, hear me out.
if you are determined to go down this dark road, and unbeknownst to me steal this...
paternal rights waiver that's sitting on my desk, and have this Frank guy sign both sides and date the top, I can't be part of that, either.
hmm.
okay, l-I'm gonna go to dad's.
Oh, wait! Why don't you let me walk with you?
uh, shouldn't you be resting?
No! I'm fine.
the doctor said I should actually keep my blood flowing.
well, do you have to do it while we walk over to Edie's?
I just... I don't wanna risk you running into dad.
okay...
you guys have just been so chummy lately, and... this whole flirting thing is kind of freaking me out.
wait a second, we're... we're not flirting.
mom, you fed him eggs with your fork.
okay, yes, I am closer to your father than I have been in the past.
the bitter hatred's now settled into a respectful disgust.
that's the kind of thing most children of divorce dream about.
Hey, Edie. What's all this stuff for?
Oh, hi! Don't tell anyone, but I'm planning a huge surprise for Karl.
a surprise?
Yeah, I'm putting together an engagement party tomorrow afternoon.
Oh, cool.
but that's not the surprise.
actually, it's gonna be a surprise wedding.
I know!
my pilates teacher got ordained over the internet.
the, uh, church of the divine something or other.
I'm not sure. Anyway, it's all legal.
and, well, just one more day before I make an honest man out of your daddy.
Oh! You're so sweet.
thank you so much for your good wishes.
Oh. No, Edie, wait. Um, no, it's just that...
you know, I was married to Karl, and I used to... try to surprise him, and he would always, always, always say...
no, Susan. Don't surprise me. I don't like it.
whatever. I'm doing it, so keep your trap shut.
now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go and buy a wedding dress.
Oh, and by the way, I'll be wearing white, so that'll be a surprise for everybody.
I don't know why I have to get dragged into this.
what happened with my kids has nothing to do with Bree's situation with Andrew.
sit.
well, it's my understanding that real harm could have come to your children as a direct result of your friend's behavior.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bormanis, but I'm not gonna testify.
it just doesn't feel right to me.
well, this isn't the first time someone's felt the way you do.
so this isn't the first time I've had to say that if you refuse to give a deposition of your own accord, I'll compel you to give one.
but I'm sure I won't have to.
you're saying Bree did this?
while under the influence.
I understand your reluctance to turn on a friend, but this isn't about you.
it's about Andrew.
don't you think he's suffered enough?
how much are you gonna give him?
I figured we could start with forty.
thousand?
he's a bouncer in a strip club. Offer him eight.
he's not going to sell his baby for $8, 000.
are we talking about the same idiot?
I think for $8, 000, you throw in a kidney.
I'm not gonna blow this by bargain hunting.
you know, that's your problem, Carlos.
remember when you bought your car? You paid sticker.
nobody pays sticker! Okay, and what's the sticker price on a child, huh?
tell me that. I'm thinking $12, 000.
Frank, you have to sign the paper.
I made a deal with these people. A deal?
this isn't a used car we're talking about. It's our baby.
before you screw this up, just remember that I can go to the cops and tell them about the pot farm you have going on in our basement.
it's just a couple plants.
Yeah, I don't do it for profits.
hobby, mostly.
Oh, come on, Frank. You know you would be a lousy father.
it's my kid! And I have a right to mess her up if I want.
and if you go near the police, I'll tell 'em how you've been stealing all those tips from Sheila.
okay, we're done.
Gaby, Gaby, no, just... hold on.
now maybe there's a way that we can work this out together.
there is nothing to work out.
if Frank is not on board with this, it's over.
wait! Uh... it doesn't matter what he wants.
why not?
because it's not your baby.
that's a lie.
what if I took a paternity test? Will that shut you up?
wait, if it's not Frank's, then whose is it?
I'm not sure.
all's I know is, I got pregnant right after I worked at the calgary rodeo, and I was very popular there.
so what are you saying, you screwed a bunch of cowboys?
you have your hobbies...
and I have mine.
you think this is funny?
Oh, don't you get it?
we just got our baby back.
um...
well, you take care now.
Ahem. Yeah.
Hi.
I got, uh, your message that you wanted to see me before the meeting started.
Yeah, I did. Um, there's someone I'd like to introduce you to.
Bree, this is Donna.
Donna, this is Bree. What's up?
Hi.
Donna is gonna be your new sponsor.
I, um, I don't want a new sponsor.
I'm... I'm very comfortable working with you.
look, this was always just a temporary arrangement.
and given what happened the other night, I think it's best if we just end this now.
Peter, all we did was kiss.
we'd be kidding ourselves if we didn't think that whatever's between us isn't going to affect our recovery.
it's not a good time for change in my life, Peter.
terrible things are happening. I'm headed to court.
I need your support now more than ever.
you'll have support, Bree.
it just won't be mine.
but, Peter...
Oh, Bree could never have done that!
I'm just telling you what the lawyer said.
so you think Bree punched Andrew in the face?
cause I don't.
I don't either, but on the other hand, she spanked my kids, she lied about her drinking and I once saw her bitch slap her mother-in-law.
so I'm torn.
well, I'm siding with Bree.
how can you be so sure?
we have Andrew saying that it's systematic physical abuse.
and then we have Bree saying it's Andrew wanting to be emancipated so he can get at his trust fund so he can buy a car.
how are we supposed to know the real truth?
because I remember being 17.
and I would've done a hell of a lot more than punch myself in the eye to get a car.
Karl, stop! Stop!
Oh! It's an emergency.
just calm down. What's going on?
Edie is gonna marry you tomorrow. What?
she's planned this whole secret wedding.
it's a surprise.
God, I hate surprises!
I know. I told her that.
I said, "he always, always hates surprises.
all right, don't get yourself all worked up here.
put our heads together. We'll come up with something.
so the thing you gotta know about me is my style is proactive.
I don't hold your hand if you go on a bender.
I believe in behavior modification.
hmm. Some muffins?
Oh. Oh, that's okay. I-I'm not big on snacks.
you should also know...
I'm not a lesbian.
Oh!
well, good for you.
well, see, if i was, the program wouldn't let me be your sponsor.
not great for your recovery if we get tangled up in a little somethin'.
so, um, whatever vibe you might be getting, that's all on you.
um, Donna...
l-I really appreciate everything that you've been doing for me, but I think I was really making some progress with Peter as my sponsor.
and I was thinking...
all right, stop right there!
you're fixating on Peter.
well, I just really feel like I'm jeopardizing my recovery by switching. You're making cuses.
see, I have a 99% success rate as a sponsor because I have 0% tolerance for people who lie to themselves.
now come on.
come on? Where are we going?
hiking. There's nothing like it to take your mind off booze.
I got it!
I'll just be the woman. I'll say I want a big wedding.
you know, the church, the big ballroom, smushing cake in her face... it'll take months to plan.
that's great. And of course, I'll have to tell her you're the one who ruined the surprise.
you're gonna make me take the hit?
Yeah.
Hey, guys. What you doing out here?
uh, just talking.
Oh, well, come on in. I've got something to show you.
Oh, no, that's okay.
come on! You'll love this.
wait until I leave to tell her, 'cause she's gonna kill me.
well, I should go.
I'm not gonna scream or cry or pound your faces in with a mallet, which, lord knows, is my right.
but what I will say is that you two are the most reprehensible excuses for human beings that I have ever met!
do you have anything to add?
right. What the hell.
Oh! Get out! Get...
Hey, Mrs. Scavo.
that's a... that's a sweet ride.
Yeah, you think so?
why don't you come over here for a second?
I'd like to pick your brain.
you're the demographic that my client is interested in, so you'd actually be doing me a favor if you drove it around for a couple hours, and tell me what you thought. Do you mind?
are you kidding me?
I can't believe you are old enough to drive.
I still remember when you were 10 years old.
I paid you a dollar to rake our leaves.
Yeah.
Yeah, you were pretty cheap.
is this set up for mp3?
uh, all the bells and whistles, but listen...
I really wanted to tell you how sorry I am.
hmm?
your lawyer came to see me.
I'm going to be deposed.
it's going to be hard for me...
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
you just have to remember she's a different person when she drinks.
she must be.
it's hard for me to imagine the Bree I know capable of hurting you.
Yeah.
do you have the keys?
Oh. Sure.
anyway, I just...
I feel so guilty that this all went on in your house, right under our nose.
so if there is anything I can do to help you...
well, can you get a discount on these?
um...
actually, yeah. One of the perks.
even so, it's a little out of the price range of a high school student.
well, if you tell my lawyer the truth, I don't think money's gonna be a problem.
Hi. What's going on?
Edie wants to discuss our little... deception.
exactly how ugly is this gonna get?
how long does it take to shut a door?
I can forgive your trickery.
I can forgive the humiliation.
but what I can't forgive is the complete and utter lack of faith in me!
I mean, having Susan get married for insurance was my idea!
okay, so if I'd known that everything had gotten all screwed up, of course I would've agreed.
look, Edie, in retrospect...
Yes, we didn't think.
we didn't handle this the way mature adults should have.
he's right. We behaved like children...
naughty, stupid children.
well, that makes me feel better that you could admit that.
because... when naughty children misbehave, they know that they're gonna get punished. Don't they?
punished?
Mm-hmm. At this point, I'd like to point out that, uh, it was Karl who proposed.
you are gonna throw me an elaborate wedding.
Yes, of course.
anything, baby.
how elaborate?
well, figure out exactly what it is that you could afford, and triple it.
as for you... okay, now remember, I'm broke.
I'm well aware of your church mouse status.
I don't intend to lift a finger during the planning and execution of this crushingly expensive wedding.
no. No, of course not.
and anything I can do to help...
uh, you know, I would... I could help with how's that?
well, I wasn't planning on inviting you.
but...
I will need a bartender.
Oh, oh, and, um...
make sure you come in through the back door.
you're just in time.
Mrs. Svo has been sworn in, so we're all ready to start.
Hey.
Hi.
all right, we are now on the record.
okay.
isn't it true that while your children were in Bree's care, that she passed out drunk and allowed them to wander off to a downtown business district?
my kids don't waer. They scurry, like rats.
excuse me? Do you know a rat can fit through a hole
anyway, my children have that trick down, too.
Mrs. Scavo, are you saying that you don't hold Mrs. Van de kamp responsible for endangering your children?
no, I don't hold her responsible.
Bree Van De Kamp and I have known each other a long time.
I trust her completely.
she's a wonderful friend and a fantastic mother.
she puts the rest of us to shame.
she's lying! Are you gonna let her get away with this crap?
please.
do you consider Mrs. Van De Kamp to have a drinking problem?
no.
then why did you line empty wine bottles up on her front stoop?
I was helping Bree with her recycling.
do I need to remind you of the potential consequences of perjury?
no, you don't. In fact, I hate liars.
Hello?
Peter. Hi, it's Bree.
Hey, Bree.
you know, um, if you feel like you're gonna need a drink, you should call Donna.
No! No, l-I don't feel like I'm gonna drink.
and if I did, I certainly would call Donna.
I mean, she and I are just... we're just really clicking.
Oh, that's good. So why are you calling?
I know it's really late notice, but a friend of mine, uh, got engaged and she's throwing a party, and I thought, um, maybe you'd like to come.
well, you're not my sponsor anymore, so I assume this is allowable.
I mean, it's just a casual get-together.
and they're having sushi. You do like sushi, don't you?
okay, Peter, I just really...
need us to be friends.
when I'm with you, I'm not myself, which is a good thing.
I can... I can relax when i'm with you in a way that I can't when I'm with other people.
with them, I have to pretend that I have it all together, but...
you know that I don't, so it's just so much easier.
come on, it's just a...
it's just a dumb old party.
do not call me again.
Oh!
Paul! I am so glad you made it.
I appreciate the invitation, Edie.
although, frankly, I'm a little surprised to get it considering how people in this neighborhood feel about me.
Oh. You know me. I like to be inclusive.
Ooh! It's heavy.
uh, unh-unh. This is flat.
I think I'd like, um...
a rusty nail.
a what now?
it's a cocktail, well, I'm not really sure what's in it.
but it sounds obscure and complicated, so chop-chop.
be right there.
Hey, hey. Put that down. We gotta go.
our birth mother just weninto labor. What?
that's fantastic! Yeah, can you believe it? We're gonna be parents.
I'll go get the car. Come on.
we were supposed to have four weeks.
she promised me the baby wasn't due for four more weeks.
we don't have anything! We don't... we don't have diapers, and we don't have the stuff babies drink.
formula.
you know, this is a total inconvenience.
welcome to parenthood. Come on.
this is your father's bartender bible.
see if you can find a recipe for a rusty nail. Okay.
um, mom?
Where'd you find that?
it was stuck in here between a pink squirrel and a pisco sour.
Oh.
well, why is your father keeping this?
why you think?
Hey, Susie.
Karl, this marriage...
our marriage, this fake marriage, that's what it is, right? Fake.
what are you talking about?
what's this?
nothing.
yeah? Mm-hmm.
okay, then, repeat after me.
our marriage is fake, and I'm going to marry the woman I really love...
if that's what you want me to say.
no, no, no, no! It's not about what I want you to say.
you have to want to say that you want to marry Edie.
don't worry about this, Susie.
why are you hanging on to that?
I need to look at it from time to time.
Why?
consider it my punishment.
for screwing up the best thing that ever happened to me.
Oh. Oh, no, no, no. This is not happening.
no, wha... mmm. Mmm!
Oh, karl! Oh! Will you...
are you crazy?! Just tell me what to do, Susie.
if you want me to marry Edie, I will.
you want me to call off the wedding, I'll do it.
I'll do whatever you want. I'm putty.
Karl! Whoa!
what are you doing?
I'm, just, uh, putting away some coats.
Oh.
well, it's time to open my presents.
let's go.
Oh, hello.
Hi.
Hi. Um, I need some advice from a professional.
I'd like to get stinking drunk.
do you have anything that can accomplish that in a hurry?
I forgot the lamaze book in my purse!
Oh, forget it. Come on. Let's go. We'll wing it.
Oh, we missed it!
the kid just slipped right out.
are you family?
they're the parents.
would you like to help?
no, thanks.
you guys look like you got it covered.
Oh, are you sure, honey?
come on, Gaby.
I just, um...
l-I don't wanna do anything to screw it up.
she won't break.
here.
okay.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, honey, you were right.
about what?
it was all worth it.
serving bowls. Just what I needed, lynette.
there's a gift receipt taped to the bottom of the box.
Oh. Thank god!
okay, the next one is from Felicia.
I do hope you like it.
Oh, you know what they say...
good things come in small packages.
what is it?
teeth?
dentures.
they were my dear sister Martha's.
I'm sure none of you knew, but she had orthodontic issues from the time she was a child.
Oh.
thank you.
I know it's an unconventional gift for an engagement party, but you and Martha were such close friends, Edie.
I wanted you to have something truly personal to remember her by, since she left us so... abruptly.
you know, when Paul Young strangled her, crushed her windpipe and buried her alive next to a garbage-strewn hiking trail.
Felicia, uh... I think you've had enough.
I do apologize if I've offended anyone, but... while you all are chitchatting and eating these gummy hors d'oeuvres, just remember...
you're in the company of a murderer.
why didn't you call Donna?
hmm.
I don't need Donna.
I need you.
you know, I don't even like red heads.
okay, it's my turn.
Shh. In a minute.
come on, you're hogging her.
tell me! You tell me who it is, Libby.
are you drunk?
who is he, Libby? Hmm?
I got to know.
I already told you, he's just some rodeo guy.
I don't even remember his name. Liar!
what are you doing?
I am gonna light myself on fire.
he's gonna light himself on fire with coffee liqueur?
would not have been my choice.
tell me his name, or I'm gonna do it!
Frank, you're being an idiot.
it was Dale, okay? It was Dale.
my brother Dale? He's a kid!
well, he's 19, Frank. He knows which end is up.
wait, what is she saying?
there's a father.
Hey! Hey!
no. leave me alone!
I'm not giving up the baby.
let's get him out of here.
No! No!
what the hell are you doing?
taking our baby home.
she's not ours. The papers aren't valid anymore.
she has a father.
do you really wanna leave this beautiful little girl with that white trash freak show?!
huh?
well, come on, then.
where?
maternity. Maternity.
all right.
hurry up!
I'm hurrying.
man, there's a lot of straps on this thing!
how does this thing go in? Read the instructions!
pass strap 'a' through strap 'b,'
making sure that the harness clip is at the chest level.
well, which damn one is the harness clip? That is after the baby is in.
you have to connect it to the car first!
I told you we should've got an s. u.v!
okay, stop yelling! This is very complicated.
Oh, for god's sakes. Just take the baby.
Wow. We're good to go.
give me the baby.
you know this isn't gonna end well.
you know, they're just gonna try and take her back.
maybe. But we don't have to make it easy for them.
Gaby, l...
look, just buckle up!
temptation comes to all of us.
whether or not we succumb depends on our ability to recognize its disguise.
sometimes it arrives in the form of an old flame, flickering back to life.
or a new friend who could end up being so much more.
or a young child who awakens feelings we didn't know we had.
and so we give in to temptation, all the while knowing come morning, we'll have to suffer the consequences.
God, I LOVE SEEING YOU LAUGH.
Oh, WELL, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE MOOD TO. THANK YOU.
persistence PAID OFF FOR SUSAN'S NEW FRIEND.
you're GONNA LEAVE ME OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE?
ANBREE BEGAN TO REGRET WHAT SHE HAD DONE.
Orson HODGE DREAMED OF THE PERFECT HONEYMOON.
indeed, HE'D BEGUN PLANNING IT THE MOMENT BREE VAN DE KAMP AGREED TO MARRY HIM.
they'd START BY FLYING FIRST CLASS
to AN EXCLUSIVE 5-STAR HOTEL
where THEY'D SPEND THEIR DAYS BY THE POOL
and THEIR NIGHTS MAKING LOVE.
and WHEN THEY RETURNED HOME,
their PERFECT HONEYMOON WOULD CONTINUE... FOREVER.
Mrs. HODGE?
Yes, MR. HODGE?
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HAPPY WE'RE GOING TO BE?
I DON'T NEED TO BE ANY HAPPIER THAN I AM ALREADY AT THIS VERY SECOND.
Oh, MY GOODNESS, THERE'S ONLY 15 MINUTES BEFORE OUR PLANE.
if YOU WANT THAT LATTE, YOU SHOULD GO NOW.
Yeah, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
...SHORT OF HEART-WRENCHING.
the POPULATION OF HOMELESS TEENAGERS CONTINUES TO CLIMB.
this IS ANDREW.
Andrew, WHAT IS IT LIKE TO LIVE ON THE STREETS?
it's NOT SO BAD. I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
sometimes PEOPLE GIVE YOU FOOD.
you CAN FIND A LOT IN DUMPSTERS.
uh, I-I MEAN, JUST LAST NIGHT,
I FOUND ALMOST A WHOLE BUCKET OF CHICKEN THAT HAD HARDLY BEEN TOUCHED.
andrew TOLD ME HIS HEART-WRENCHING STORY
an ALCOHOLIC MOTHER,
a THER MURDERED BY THE WOMAN'S BOYFRIEND AND A CHILDHOOD SHATTERED
the DAY HIS MOTHER ABANDONED HIM ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.
I'll TELL YOU ONE THING.
some PEOPLE JUST SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO HAVE CHILDREN.
darling, I GOT AN EXTRA ONE JUST IN CASE YOU...
Bree, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
a REPORTER JUST DID A STORY ON HOMELESS TEENS, AND MY SON WAS ONE OF THEM.
Oh, MY GOD.
well, WE'LL CALL CHILD WELFARE THE MINUTE WE GET TO THE RESORT.
Orson, YOU CAN'TMAGINE THAT WE'RE STILL GOING!
well, DARLING, THE TICKETS ARE NONREFUNDABLE.
my SON IS EATING OUT OF DUMPSTERS!
well, YES, BUT THINK HOW MUCH BETTER YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS AFTER A NICE, RELAXING
my CHILD IS IN TROUBLE.
don't MAKE ME CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU, BECAUSE BELIEVE ME, YOU WILL LOSE.
now PLEASE, GET YOUR ASS IN GEAR.
it WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT ORSON REALIZED
their HONEYMOON WAS OVER...
in MORE WAYS THAN ONE.
it WAS A HOLIDAY WEEKEND ON WISTERIA LANE,
and EVERYONE WAS PACKING THEIR BAGS,
hoping TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL.
no, NO, ALL RIGHT, GOOD-BYE, GOOD-BYE! -NO, NO! THIS IS SO... UNFAIR.
no, NO! WHAT'S UNFAIR IS THAT WE'RE SLOWLY RUNNING OUT OF MONEY,
and YOU'VE BARELY EVEN LOOKED FOR A JOB.
you're GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME, ALL RIGHT? I LOVE YOU. GOOD-BYE!
Lynette WAS GETTING AWAY FROM GROWING TENSION IN HER MARRIAGE.
you CAN CALL IT BLACKMAIL, CARLOS, BUT THE COURT CALLS IT "SPOUSAL SUPPORT,
so UNLESS I GET A CHECK BY MONDAY,
your SHOWER BUDDIES FROM JAIL WILL BE THROWING YOU A "WELCOME BACK" PARTY.
Gabrielle WAS GETTING AWAY FROM AN INCREASINGLY BITTER DIVORCE.
Hi.
I'm READY.
so THAT'S MY NUMBER, IN CASE THERE'S ANY CHANGE IN MIKE'S CONDITION.
I'm GOING TO THE MOUNTAINS WITH A FRIEND.
and, UH, JUST IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING, IT'S STRICTLY PLATONIC.
he WASN'T WONDERING.
Susan WAS GETTING AWAY FROM MOUNTING GUILT.
so YOU CAN'T TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT MY SON'S WHEREABOUTS?
and THEN THERE WAS BREE,
who HAD JUST LEARNED THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS...
fine! -YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM.
some REPORTER.
all SHE COULD TELL ME WAS WHAT NEIGHBORHOOD THEY FOUND HIM IN.
they DON'T HAVE ANY CONTACT INFORMATION, NO PHONE NUMBER, NO ADDRESS.
well, DEAR, IF HE HAD AN ADDRESS, HE WOULDN'T BE HOMELESS.
this REALLY BLOWS. I AM THIS CLOSE TO BECOMING HOMECOMING QUEEN,
and NOW I'M GONNA BE THAT CREEPY GIRL WHOSE BROTHER'S A PATHETIC STREET JUNKIE.
you KNOW, YOU COULD SHOW A LITTLE COMPASSION.
your BROTHER IS OUT THERE ON THE STREETS, STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE.
and WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?
Oh, SHE'S RIGHT. THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.
you CAN'T BLAME YOURSELF.
no PARENT CAN STOP A CHILD WHO'S DETERMINED TO RUN AWAY.
he DIDN'T RUN AWAY.
I KICKED HIM OUT.
you WHAT?
I LEFT HIM ON THE ROADSIDE WITH SOME MONEY AND HIS CLOTHES.
I DIDN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'D THINK OF ME.
you DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.
I JUST WISH YOU'D SAID SOMETHING SOONER.
don't YOU KNOW THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T TELL ME?
I DON'T WANT THERE TO BE ANY SECRETS BETWEEN US.
there WON'T BE, NOT ANYMORE.
you KNOW, ANDREW IS NOT THE ONLY ONE HAVING A ROUGH YEAR.
I'm THE ONE WHOSE BOYFRIEND GOT SHOT RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.
we'll TALK IN THE CAR.
don't YOU LOVE THIS?
Oh, GOD BLESS TOM FOR TAKING THE KIDS CAMPING THIS WEEKEND.
this IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED,
especially AFTER EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN THROUGH LATELY.
I LL ABOUT RELAXING AND REJUVENATING
Gaby? YEAH?
could YOU BE ALL ABOUT SHUTTING UP?
Oh, I'M SORRY. -THANKS.
please DON'T TELL ME YOU BROUGHT YOUR CELL PHONE.
Oh, I'M SORRY.
it's JUST--I'M WAITING FOR CARLOS' LAWYER TO CALL.
this WHOLE SPOUSAL SUPPORT THING'S GOTTEN UGLY.
Hello?
Oh, HI, TOM!
No! NO, NO, NO. NO!
Yeah! YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT HERE. HANG ON.
did YOU SAY SOMETHING?
Hey.

I THREW IT OUT AGAIN. SO?
so I CAN--I CAN BARELY SIT UP. THE KIDS ARE RUNNING WILD.
I... I NEED YOU TO COME UP HERE.
well, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A MUSCLE RELAXANT?
honey, I'VE ALREADY TAKEN TWO. THEY'RE NOT MAKING A DENT.
well, WHY DON'T YOU GIVE THEM TO THE KIDS?
Ugh, LYNETTE!
please DON'T-- PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO ME.
Parker, FOR THE LAST TIME, put down the damn ax!
Oh, ALL RIGHT. YEAH, YEAH.
I WILL BE THERE AS SOON AS I CAN.
God, I HATE MY LIFE.
I KNOW.
I WOULDN'T TRADE WITH YOU FOR ANYTHING.
Oh, WOW, LOOK AT THE VIEW.
Oh!
don't YOU JUST LOVE WHEN THE LEAVES CHANGE COLOR?
well, THAT'S WHY I SUGGESTED THIS, SO--SO WE COULD HANG OUT FOR THE WEEKEND
and... AND ENJOY THE, UM...
Yep, THE SCENERY'S GREAT.
so, UM...
maybe I SHOULD UNPACK.
where SHOULD I DO THAT?
One--one IS MINE...
and THERE'S A GUEST ROOM.
Oh!
a GUEST ROOM. THAT--WELL, THAT'S HANDY.
Yeah.
uh, UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU--YOU'D LIKE TO SLEEP IN MY ROOM.
in WHICH CASE, I WOULD TAKE THE GUEST ROOM.
Oh! I... UH, NO, NO!
I-I SHOULD TAKE THE GUEST ROOM BECAUSE I AM THE GUEST.
Yeah, WELL, IT'S, UH, IT'S UP THE STAIRS AT THE END OF THE HALL.
okay.
Susan, I,UM...
I THINK I HAVE YOUR SUITCASE.
Yeah, AND I THINK I HAVE YOURS.
so, DID YOU, UM, DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE THE, UM
Yeah.
and DID YOU NOTICE... - HARD TO MISS.
well, I'M JUST GOING TO, UM... -HIDE PATHETICALLY IN YOUR ROOM?
me, TOO
Hey, LYNETTE.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
Kayla CALLED, AND SHE TOLD ME ABOUT TOM'S BACK.
and MY CAR GOT IMPOUNDED AGAIN,
so I THOUGHT THAT I'D HITCH A RIDE WITH YOU.
hitch?
you MEAN, LIKE, WE'RE GONNA BE DRIVING IN THE CAR TOGETHER?
well, YOU COULD STRAP ME TO THE FRONT BUMPER,
but, UH, YEAH, I'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE INSIDE.
uh, IT'S LIKE AN 8-HOUR DRIVE.
so?
um, HOW FAR IS THE IMPOUND LOT?
because, YOU KNOW, I COULD JUST DRIVE YOU OVER THERE AND
what's YOUR PROBLEM, LYNETTE?
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM. I JUST DON'T THINK WE BOTH NEED TO GO UP THERE.
I CAN GRAB KAYLA AND BRING HER BACK.
Oh, I SEE YOUR PLAN
you JUST WANNA GO CHARGING UP THERE ON YOUR WHITE HORSE
and SAVE EVERYONE, AND THEN I GET TO BE THE ROTTEN MOTHER WHO DIDN'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS AND STAYED HOME EATING BONBONS.
no.
due TO LYNETTE'S SUDDEN DEPARTURE... -THANK YOU.
Gabrielle WAS FORCED TO SPEND THE LAST NIGHT OF HER SPA VACATION ALONE,
but SHE DIDN'T MIND.
in FACT, SHE LOOKED FORWARD TO A QUIET DINNER ALONE WITH HER THOUGHTS.
unfortunately FOR GAIELLE,
her THOUGHTS QUICKLY TURNED TO HER IMPENDING DIVORCE
and THE EMPTY HOUSE SHE'D SOON RETURN TO,
and SHE BEGAN TO RESENT THE HAPPY COUPLES SHE WAS SEEING...
everywhere.
what IS THIS, FREAKIN' NOAH'S ARK?!
I GUESS IT REALLY IS A SMALL WORLD.
who's THERE? I CAN'T SEE YOU.
can YOU SEE ME NOW?
how MUCH, BABY?
excuse ME, MA'AM?
I MEAN... MISS,
I'm LOOKING FOR SOMEONE. UH, HIS NAME IS ANDREW.
have YOU SEEN HIM?
hard TO SAY, BOO. I SEE A LOT OF LOST BOYS HIS AGE.
good-looking ONE, THOUGH. SOMEONE SPECIAL?
Yes, VERY, AND I'M WORRIED SICK ABOIM.
you MIGHT TRY THE SOUP KITCHEN AT ST. MALACHI'S ON THIRD.
Oh, THANK YOU, MISS... - GATES. PEARLY GATES
cause YOU CAN'T GET TO HEAVEN WITHOUT GOING THROUGH ME.
how VERY SAUCY.
great PIANO. DO YOU PLAY?
Oh, NO, I'M A-- I'M A BIT RUSTY.
Jane LOVED TO SING, SO I'D PLAY FOR HER, BUT SINCE THE ACCIDENT...
right.
so...
brandy,
a ROARING FIRE
what COULD BE MORE ROMANTIC?
well, I CAN THINK OF-- OF SOMETHING.
wow, MY HEART IS POUNDING.
uh, IS THAT A BAD THING? CONSIDER THE ALTERNATIVE.
your HEART IS BEATING EVEN FASTER THAN MINE.
I GUESS I'M EXCITED. IT HAS BEEN A WHILE.
me, TOO.
so WAS THAT, UH, OKAY?
it WAS BLOODY FANTASTIC.
of COURSE, IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I'M USED TO.
different?
well, I - I WAS WITH THE SAME WOMAN FOR A LONG TIME.
Oh, YEAH.
but, I MEAN, YOU KISSED OTHER GIRLS BEFORE THAT, RIGHT?
sure, BUT MOST OF THEM WERE 12.
as WAS I.
I MEET JANE AT A SCHOOL DANCE, AND AFTER WE STARTED DATING,
well, I-- WELL, I NEVER LOOKED AT ANYONE ELSE.
are YOU SAYING THAT JANE IS THE ONLY WOMAN YOU EVER...
Oh, GOD, I SO DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU THAT.
why NOT? I THINK THAT'S ADORABLE.
well, I DON'T WANT TO BE ADORABLE. I WANT TO BE DASHING AND WORLDLY AND...
Oh, IAN. IT'S OKAY.
some PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF LOVERS, AND SOME JUST A FEW.
it DOESN'T MATTER.
well, SEE-- SEEING AS IT DOESN'T MATTER, WHERE-- WHERE DO YOU FALL ON THAT SPECTRUM?
you KNOW, HOW-- HOW MANY MEN HAVE YOU BEEN WITH?
Ian. - OH, I'M SORRY. THAT--THAT WAS RUDE.
I WITHDRAW THE QUESTION.
it's NOT THAT IT'S RUDE. IT'S JUST IMMATERIAL.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST A NUMBER. IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
seeing AS IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING--- IAN!
well, YOU KNOW MY NUMBER. IT'S ONLY FAIR.
is IT-- IS IT MORE THAN THREE?
nine.
please TELL ME YOU WERE ANSWERING IN GERMAN.
nine LOVERS IS NOT A LOT! NINE LOVERS DOES NOT MAKE ME A SLUT!
why ARE YOU GETTING UPSET?
because IT WAS REALLY 11, AND I KNOCKED OFF TWO, AND YOU'RE STILL JUDGING ME.
I'm NOT JUDGING YOU. IT'S JUST... DID YOU WORK IN THE RECORDING INDUSTRY?
okay, JUST SO YOU KNOW, 11 IS NOT A LOT FOR A WOMAN MY AGE.
how OLD ARE YOU?
what IS THIS, THE GALLUP POLL?!
where-- WHERE YOU GOING? - TO BED, ALONE.
you KNOW, IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO TRY, BUT I'VE JUST NEVER GOTTEN AROUND TO.
so THEY LIKED THE LANDSCAPING I DID HERE SO MUCH
that THEY HIRED MY COMPANY TO DO WHOLE SINCLAIR HOTEL CHAIN.
your COMPANY? YOU HAVE A COMPANY NOW?
Oh, MY GOSH, WHEN I MET YOU, ALL YOU HAD WAS A BIKE.
well, NOT ONLY THAT,
the, UH, GARDENING CHANNEL'S APPROACHED ME ABOUT HOSTING MY OWN SHOW.
I MEAN, WE'RE STILL IN THE TALKING STAGES, BUT...
what?
nothing. I JUS.
I CAN'T GET OVER HOW TURE AND CONFIDENT YOU ARE.
you've REALLY CHANGED.
Thanks. I WAS HOPING YOU'D NOTICE.
so I GUESS, UH, THERE'S NO CHANCE OF GETTING YOU OVER TO THE HOUSE TO PICK THE DEAD LEAVES OFF MY FICUS.
Yeah, YOU KNOW, I'M--I'M KIND OF PAST THAT.
besides, I DON'T THINK MR. SOLIS WOULD APPROVE.
actually, WE'RE GETTING A DIVORCE.
um, I'M--I'M REALLY SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
Really? THEN WHY ARE YOU SMILING?
I DON'T KNOW. WHY ARE YOU?
it's REALLY GREAT TO SEE YOU.
I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE EVER CALLED ME THAT.
well, UM...
I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE REST OF YOUR STAY.
I INTEND TO.
your CUPPY THING IS FULL.
do YOU MIND IF I PUT THIS IN YOUR GLOVE COMPARTMENT?
Yeah, I DO MIND. I MIND DEEPLY.
Oh, THAT'S... DELIGHTFUL. THAT'S DELIGHTFUL.
maybe IT'LL JUST SOAK UP THE CREAM SODA YOU SPILLED.
why DO YOU ALWAYS PICK ON ME?
it's LIKE YOUR NEW FAVORITE GAME IS "FINDING FAULT WITH NORA."
no, MY FAVORITE GAME
is COUNTING ALL THE THINGS I'M DYING TO SAY TO YOU,
but I DON'T.
like...
pipe DOWN, YOU ANNOYING NUT JOB.
I'd NEVER SAY THAT.
No!
you're COLORFUL
colorful IN A WAY THAT MIGHT RESPOND TO MEDICATION.
well, YOU KNOW...
there's LEVELS OF CRAZY, LYNETTE.
I MEAN, THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO JUST HAVE A BIG PERSONALITY.
then THERE ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO DO THINGS LIKE THIS.
Aah! OH, MY GOD! KNOCK IT OFF! - WHAT IS THE TTER WITH YOU?!
what IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?
Oh, LIGHTEN UP. COME ON, IT WAS A JOKE.
no, WELL, IT WASN'T FUNNY. IF YOU WANNA KILL YOURSELF, FINE, - BUT DON'T TAKE ME WITH YOU. - OOH, YOU'D LIKE THAT, WOULDN'T YA?
you'd REALLY LIKE THAT, IF I KILLED MYSELF.
that IS NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.
but IF YOU DID, I'D FIND A WAY TOARRY ON.
pull OVER.
Oh, LIGHTEN UP. IT'S A JOKE. -PULL THE CAR OVER.
Nah. -PULL IT OVER!
pull OVER, OR I WILL JUMP OUT OF THIS CAR. -ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I'm PULLING OVER! JEEZ! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!
hitching MY WAY...
to THE CAMPSITE!
you CAN'T BE SERIOUS!
shut UP! JUST GET OUT OF MY FACE!
I'm NOT TALKING TO YOU!
all RIGHT, NOW LOOK, YOU'VE GONE FROM CRAZY TO STUPID.
this GUY COULD BE DANGEROUS.
well, THEN, IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY, HUH, LYNETTE?
shut UP!
see?
this IS WHAT YOU DO. YOU JUST MANIPULATE.
you WORMED YOUR WAY INTO MY FAMILY.
you CONNED YOUR WAY INTO COMING ON THIS TRIP WITH ME,
and NOW YOU WANNA FORCE ME INTO SAVING YOU.
well, FORGET IT! YOU WANNA GO, GO.
no, I'VE TRIED THAT. IT WASN'T ENOUGH POWER.
Yeah, I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU.
all RIGHT, HERE IT GOES.
Ah, IT WORKED! I'M A GENIUS.
Oh, HI. UM, I'M LOOKING FOR EDIE.
she's OUT.
Ugh, GOD, WHERE IS EVERYONE TONIGHT? - ANYTHING I CAN DO?
no, NOT UNLESS YOU CAN FIX A FUSE BOX.
my SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT BLEW THE POWER OUT.
Oh, WHAT'S YOUR PROJECT?
Oh, UH, IT'S COMPLICATED.
you THINK I'M TOO DUMB TO UNDERSTAND YOUR LITTLE SCIENCE PROJECT?
it's NOT LITTLE. I FINISHED THIRD IN THE STATE TWICE.
now CAN YOU FIX THE FUSE BOX OR NOT?
most HOUSES BUILT AFTER 1990 ARE WIRED THROUGH A CIRCUIT BREAKER.
you DIDN'T BLOW A FUSE. YOU TRIPPED A BREAKER.
not TO CHALLENGE A 2-TIME STATE SCIENCE FAIR ALMOST-CHAMPION OR ANYTHING.
let ME GRAB A FLASHLIGHT.
maybe YOU COULD ALSO GRAB A SHIRT... AND SOME PANTS.
pants WOULD BE NICE.
Susan, CAN I COME IN?
I'm WITH A CLIENT. TAKE A NUMBER.
Susan, PLEASE.
everything I SAID
came OUT OF MY-- MY OWN INSECURITY AND FEAR
that I--THAT I MIGHT... WELL, I MIGHT DISAPPOINT YOU.
I WAS GONNA STAY MAD AT YOU ANOTHER HOUR,
but YO DAMN ACCENT GETS ME EVERY TIME.
blimey, YOU--YOU DON'T SAY?
Oh, NO, I-I DON'T MEAN TO BREAK THE FLOW, BUT I-I JUST, UM...
look, I KNOW THAT I'M ONLY YOUR SECOND LOVER EVER,
and THAT-- I - I KNOW THAT MEANS A LOT,
and I JUST DON'T WANT IT TO MEAN... TOO MUCH.
I'm NOT FOLLOWING YOU. WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO MEAN?
I MEAN, THE LAST TIME YOU DID THIS, IT TURNED INTO A LIFETIME COMMITMENT,
and I--I'M JUST-- I'M NOT READY FOR THAT.
you THINK I AM?
well, I ASSURE YOU, I'M AS CAPABLE OF HAVING MEANINGLESS SEX AS YOU ARE.
I HAVE NEVER HAD MEANINGLESS SEX.
so YOU WERE--YOU WERE PASSIONATELY IN LOVE
and DEEPLY COMMITTED TO ALL 11 OF YOUR CONQUESTS?
don't JUDGE ME, MR. VIRGIN... PLUS ONE!
okay, OKAY, WE--WE SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT AGAIN.
CHEERIO? BOB'S YOUR UNCLE?
get OUT.
can't WE AT LEAST TALK? - WHY?
you KNOW, EVERY TIME WE DO, WE JUST GET ANGRY.
well, WE'RE STILL GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER,
and THAT'S GOOD. YOU--YOU'VE LEARNED I'M A TAD INSECURE,
and I'VE LEARN--WELL, YOU'RE JUST A WEE BIT TOUCHY.
okay, IAN, YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS-- THIS NOT HAPPENING.
I AM JUST ING EP,
and YOU CAN JUST DRIVE ME HOME IN THE MORNING.
uh, EXCUSE ME. I'M LOOKING FOR MY SON. HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?
have YOU SEEN HIM?
excuse ME, YOUNG MAN. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BOY?
Andrew! OH, MY GOD, THANK GOD!
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
looking FOR YOU. HOW DID YOU GET THAT BRUISE?
it's NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. - ANDREW, PLEASE!
SHOULDN'YOU BE AT HOME, TAKING CARE OF YOUR NEW HUSBAND?
how DID YOU FIND OUT THAT
I READ IT IN THE PAPER-- YOU KNOW, THE ONE I SLEEP UNDER.
Andrew, YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE ANGRY WITH ME,
but IF YOU KNEW HOW SORRY I AM
if YOU CAME HERE SUCKING AFTER FORGIVENESS, YOU CAME TO THE WRONG PLACE.
Andrew, PLEASE, CAN'T WE JUST TALK ABOUT THIS?
I'm YOUR MOTHER, FOR GOD SAKES! YOU'RE MY SON.
no, YOU DUMPED YOUR SON AT A GAS STATION SEVEN MONTHS AGO.
Andrew, PLEASE!
what HAPPENED TO YOUR RIDE?
the GUY GRABBED MY BOOB,
so I HIT HIM OVER THE HEAD WITH HIS BONG, AND I GOT OUT.
look, I'M SORRY I FREAKED OUT THERE BEFORE.
it's JUST, WHEN YOU MADE THAT CRACK ABOUT SUICIDE, IT JUST... KIND OF HIT HOME.
Oh, MY GOD, NORA.
did YOU ACTUALLY...
well, I'M... I'M VERY SORRY. I HAD NO IDEA.
but YOUR LIFE IS BETTER NOW, RIGHT?
you HAVE A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER, AND YOU HAVE THAT FUN JOB AT THE...
pancake HOUSE.
Oh, YEAH, MY LIFE'S BETTER.
Yeah.
but IT'S NOT YOUR LIFE. YOUR LIFE'S PERFECT.
excuse ME? DID YOU SMOKE THAT BONG BEFORE YOU BEAT THE GUY WITH IT?
it's JUST, YOU HAVE IT ALL. YOU HAVE THE KIDS. YOU HAVE THE CAREER.
you HAVE A HUSBAND.
you're SUPERMOM.
and YOU THINK THAT'S EASY? OKAY, I HAVE A GOOD LIFE.
Yes, YES, I AM VERY LUCKY, BUT I WORK 12 HOURS A DAY,
and THEN I COME HOME TO WHAT SEEMS LIKE 33 CHILDREN
and HUSBAN WHO RESES TO GET A J.
and BELIEVE ME, THERE IS NOT A SUPERMOM OUT THERE WHO WOULDN'T TRADE IN HER CAPE
for A CHANCE TO READ A BOOK AND GET A MASSAGE
by A MAN WHO HAS THE DECENCY TO LEAVE WHEN IT'S OVER.
okay, SORRY I BROUGHT IT UP.
I'm SORRY I SAID THAT ABOUT TOM. HE'S DOING HIS BEST TO FIND A JOB.
well, YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE'D TRY A LITTLE HARDER IF HE DIDN'T HATE ADVERTISING SO MUCH.
he DOESN'T HATE ADVERTISING.
last WEEK, WHEN HE CAME TO PICK UP KAYLA,
and HE'D JUST COME FROM SOME CRAPPY INTERVIEW,
he SAID THAT HE'D HATED THE AD GAME FOR, LIKE, FREAKIN' EVER
and WOULD LIKE TO BAG THE WHOLE THING.
he SAID THAT TO YOU?
he's NEVER TOLD ME THAT.
he's PROBABLY AFRAID TO.
why WOULD HE BE AFRAID?
probably BECAUSE YOU'RE THE KIND OF WOMAN WHO,
when SOMEONE SAYS THEY WANNA KILL THEMSELVES,
you SAY,"GO AHEAD."
you SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO COME IN? - NO, I'M GOOD.
uh, YOU REALLY SHOULD SEE WHAT I'M DOING,
you KNOW, FOR NEXT TIME.
okay, HERE'S THE TRIPPED SWITCH.
so FIRST, YOU MOVE IT TO "OFF..." TO RESET, THEN YOU PRE IT...TO "ON."
that's IT? - YEAH.
you DIDN'T HAVE TO COME ALL THE WAY OVER HERE TO DO THAT.
you COULD'VE JUST EXPLAINED IT TO ME.
Yeah, I GUESS I COULD'VE.
well... HELLO THERE.
Edie! HI.
Oh, SORRY.
uh, HE WAS JUST-- HE WAS HELPING ME GET THE LIGHTS BACK ON.
I - I OVERLOADED MY CIRCUITS.
I CAN SEE THAT.
Yeah, SO SHE'S DOING SOME BIG SCIENCE PROJECT,
and SHE NEEDED ME TO EXPLAIN HOW ELECTRICITY WORKS.
I THINK THAT'S CALLED "IRONY."
Julie, WHERE'S YOUR MOM?
she's ON A TRIP. DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?
Yeah, BACK WHEN I COULD STAND HER, I LOANED HER MY CD PLAYER. I NEED IT.
Oh, SHE TOOK IT TO THE HOSPITAL FOR MIKE.
Oh, GOD.
this FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE ACT IS REALLY CHAPPING MY ASS.
Hey, SCIENCE GUY, I HAVE AN EXPERIMENT FOR YOU.
go HOME,
mix OUNCES OF GIN, A SPLASH OF VERMOUTH,
and SEE IF IT IMPROVES MY MOOD WHEN I DRINK IT.
Julie, SWEETIE... YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL.
do YOURSELF A FAVOR AND STAY AWAY FROM MY NEPHEW.
Oh! TRUST ME, I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SWAGGERING, MUSCLE-BOUND JUVENILE DELINQUENTS.
honey...
that's WHAT EVERY GOOD GIRL SAYS JUST BEFORE SHE BECOMES A BAD GIRL.
trust ME, I KNOW.
except NOW WHEN WE'RE DONE,
I DON'T HAVE TO PROOFREAD YOUR ESSAY ON "ETHAN FROME."
and I DON'T HAVE TO JUMP OUT OF A WINDOW. THAT'S A NICE CHANGE.
Yeah.
Hey, HOW ABOUT I ORDER UP A BOTTLE OF DOM?
Ooh, I LIKE RICH JOHN!
Hello? OH! UH, HI.
nothing, UH, YOU KNOW, JUST, UH, ROOM SERVICE AND A MOVIE.
what?
Really? YOU'RE-- YOU'RE KIDDING.
uh, NO! I'M--I'M THRILLED.
it's, UH, ROOM 424.
me, TOO. BYE.
you GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE. -WHAT?
guess SHE DECIDED TO SURPRISE ME. GET DRESSED!
uh, YOU-- YOU'RE ENGAGED? TO WHO?!
her NAME'S TAMMY. WHERE'S YOUR OTHER SHOE? !
how COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?
I WOULD NEVER HAVE LET YOU SEDUCE ME IF I KNEW YOU WERE GETTING MARRIED.
well, YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM SLEEPING WITH ME WHEN YOU WERE MARRIED!
you KNEW ABOUT CARLOS! MY CHEATING WAS UPFRONT AND HONEST.
look, GABY, WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS. GET MOVING.
no, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. IN FACT, I WANNA MEET THE BLUSHING BRIDE.
listen TO ME, OKAY?
her NAME IS TAMMY SINCLAIR, AS IN SINCLAIR HOTELS,
as IN HER FATHER OWNS THIS WHOLE DAMN CHAIN.
so IF SHE CATCHES YOU IN HERE, I AM TOTALLY SCREWED.
POODLE!
look AT YOU, SURPRISING ME.
Oh, I MISSED YOU. - I MISSED YOU, TOO.
Ugh, THIS ROOM BLOWS.
daddy WAS SUPPOSED TO HOOK US UP WITH A SUITE.
you KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.
why DON'T WE GO DOWN TO THE FRONT DESK AND DEMAND ONE?
come ON. - OH, NO. THEY'RE ALL BOOKED.
they CALL THIS A CLOSET?
where AM I SUPPOD TO PUT ALL MY STUFF?
you KNOW, I COULD REALLY USE A DRINK. WHY DON'T WE GO DOWN TO THE BAR?
I'm WIPED. I JUST WANNA STAY IN.
didn't YOU UNPACK YET?
no, UM, ACTUALLY, THE--THE ZIPPER IS STUCK,
um, BUT THEY HAVE A GUY AT THE HOTEL THAT CAN FIX IT.
you KNOW I SHOULD-- I SHOULD PROBABLY GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT DOWN TO THE LOBBY.
now?
I'm HORNY.
so AM I...
but I WILL BE A LOT HORNIER...
once I GET RID OF THIS SUITCASE.
poodle?
where DID THIS DIAMOND WATCH COME FROM?
Oh, SHOOT, UM...
that's WHAT YOU GET FOR SURPRISING ME.
I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO WRAP IT.
you LIKE IT?
I LOVE IT!
I'm NEVER TAKING IT OFF! - SON OF A BITCH!
come HERE, YOU!
John, WHERE ARE YOU, DAMN IT?
don't LAUGH. I SAVED A BUNDLE ON AIRFARE.
Susan, I'M SO
your AZALEAS ARE BREATHTAKING.
thank YOU. AHEM.
you SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF THEM.
Yeah, IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT I CAN RAISE SOME THINGS CORRECTLY.
darlin', BE PATIENT.
andrew WILL COME AROUND.
no, I DON'T THINK HE WILL.
I FAILED HIM.
I THINK YOU'RE BEING TOO HARD ON YOURSELF.
and YOU'RE NOT BEING HARD ENOUGH.
stop SAYING THAT WHAT I DID WAS UNDERSTANDABLE.
I'm A MOTHER WHO ABANDONED HER CHILD.
that's... UNNATURAL.
Bree, IT'S HOT. YOU'RE TIRED. WHY DON'T YOU COME INSIDE?
because THERE IS A BOTTLE OF CHARDONNAY IN THE REFRIGERATOR, AND RIGHT NOW
this LITTLE CHORE IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S KEEPING ME FROM GOING INSIDE
and DRINKING THE WHOLE DAMN THING.
well...
the AZALEAS REALLY ARE LOVELY.
ye THEY ARE, AREN'T THEY?
Hi.
look, I'M SORRY.
here's YOUR WATCH.
I GUESS I'LL JUST BUY TAMMY A NEW ONE.
don't YOU MEAN HER DADDY WILL BUY HER A NEW ONE AND JUST LAUNDER THE MONEY THROUGH YOU?
I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR BEING ANGRY.
all RIGHT, I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH FROM THE START.
but WHEN I SAW YOU THERE IN THE MOONLIGHT,
it TOOK ME RIGHT BACK TO WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER.
me, TOO.
do YOU WANNA SIT DOWN?
you KNOW, YOU'RE PRETTY HARD TO STAY MAD AT.
good, 'CAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T WANT THIS TO END BADLY.
who SAYS IT HAS TO END?
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
well, I'M SINGLE NOW, AND I THOUGHT WE COULD MAYBE...
Gaby... I'M GETTING MARRIED.
sure, AND I WAS MARRIED WHEN WE GOT TOGETHER.
right, BUT THAT
is NOT HOW I'M GONNA BE MARRIED.
well, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, BUT TRUST ME, MARRIAGE IS HARD.
I KNOW THAT, BUT...
I LOVE TAMMY,
and I DON'T WANNA SCREW IT UP.
cause ENOUGH OF THOSE SCREWUPS AND...
you JUST END UP ALONE.
Yeah, THAT CAN HAPPEN.
good-bye, GABRIELLE.
um, HEY, MISTER, UH,
could YOU SPARE A BUCK OR 2? I'M-- I'M REALLY HUNGRY.
Hey, THANKS!
I'll GIVE YOU $50 MORE, YOU LET ME BUY YOU LUNCH.
fries AND A LARGE ROOT BEER.
what AM I GONNA HAVE TO DO TO EARN THIS?
I TOLD YOU, I JUST WANNA TALK TO YOU.
you ANOTHER REPORTER? - NO.
you A YOUTH PASTOR? YOU TRYING TO SAVE MY SOUL?
Oh, YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A CHALLENGE.
no, I JUST WANNA UNDERSTAND YOU, ANDREW.
wait, HOW DID YOU KNOW MY NAME?
you're HIM, AREN'T Y? YOU'RE, UH...
the NEW HUSBAND.
you KNOW, I WOULDN'T TALK TO HER. AT MAKES HER THINK I'LL LISTEN TO YOU?
your MOTHER DOESN'T KNOW I'M HERE.
all RIGHT, DAD.
what DO YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT, DAD?
I WANNA KNOW HOW YOU SURVIVE OUT HERE. WHAT DO YOU DO FOR MONEY?
I ASK. PEOPLE GIVE IT TO ME.
that's IT?
what-- WHAT DO YOU WANNA KNOW?
have--have I DONE STUFF FOR MONEY THAT I'M NOT PROUD OF?
Yeah, SURE, BUT YOU FIGURED THAT OUT AS SOON I ASKED YOU WHAT THE $50 WAS FOR.
but, UH...
don't--don't TELL MY MOM.
or--or YOU KNOW WHAT? DO WHO CARES?
well, I THINK PART OF YOU WANTS ME TO TELL HER BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT WOULD HURT HER.
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE OUT HERE, ISN'T IT? TO PUNISH HER.
when WILL YOU HAVE PUNISHED HER ENOUGH, ANDREW?
when YOU TURN TO DRUGS TO NUMB THE PAIN,
or YOU CATCH A DISEASE YOU'LL NEVER BE RID OF?
don't PRETEND TO CARE ABOUT ME, ALL RIGHT?
I DO CARE ABOUT YOU, BECAUSE BREE CARES ABOUT YOU,
because WE'RE MORE ALIKE THAN YOU THINK.
I KNOW ABOUT RAGE.
I KNOW HOW IT EATS YOU UP. BUT RAGE GOES AWAY,
and WHEN IT DOES,
you're JUST LEFT WITH THE MESS YOU'VE MADE.
THKS FOR LUNCH.
you CHANGE YOUR MIND, YOU KNOW WHEREO FIND US.
how's YOUR BACK?
if I DON'T BREATHE, GREAT.
God, IT HAS BEEN SO LONG SINCE MY BACK HAS ACTED UP.
then WHAM, OUT OF THE BLUE, I'M CRYING BY A TREE STUMP.
well, YOU'RE UNDER A LOT OF STRESS.
you GOT A NEW KID IN THE FAMILY. YOU'RE JOB HUNTING.
Ugh. ARE WE GONNA FIGHT ABOUT THAT AGAIN? 'CAUSE IF SO,
I'm GONNA NEED THOSE LAST FOUR MUSCLE RELAXANTS.
no, I DON'T WANNA FIGHT. IN FACT, I WAS THINKING...
if YOU CAN'T FIND SOMETHING YOU LIKE IN ADVERTISING,
maybe YOU SHOULD CAST A WIDER NET.
meaning WHAT?
you're A BRIGHT GUY. ISN'T THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU MIGHT WANNA DO?
I'd LIKE TO PLAY BS FOR AEROSMITH.
okay, LET'S CALL THAT THE BACKUP PLAN.
but, SERIOUSLY, DON'T YOU HAVE SOME ROAD NOT TAKEN,
some DREAM YOU NEVER GOT AROUND TO?
I DON'T KNOW MAYBE.
maybe?
you LOSE TRACK OF THAT STUFF.
well, THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?
cause WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO, I'M IN YOUR CORNER.
man, DID I LUCK OUT MARRYING YOU.
tell ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW.
Hi, MIKE.
it's EDIE.
I'm SORRY THAT I HAVEN'T COME BY TO VISIT.
pretty ROUGH LUCK, HUH?
anyway, I'M, UM...
here TO PICK UP MY CD PLAYER.
so...
well, I HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER SOON.
Damn!
and THAT'S WITH THE COMA.
we ALL CARRY SOMETHING WITH US.
of COURSE, IT'S NICE IF WE TRAVEL WITH SOMEONE
but USUALLY IT'S EASIER TO JUST DROP WHAT WE'VE BEEN CARRYING
so WE CAN GET HOME THAT MUCH SOONER...
assuming, OF COURSE,
there WILL BE SOMEONE THERE TO GREET US WHEN WE ARRIVE.
why DO WE CLUTCH AT THIS BAGGAGE
even WHEN WE'RE DESPERATE TO MOVE ON?
because WE ALL KNOW THERE'S A CHANCE
we MIGHT LET GO TOO SOON.
my back. I threw it out.
jeez, are you crying?
just a little.
Edie got an unexpected visitor.
remember my little boy?
I didn't know your son was coming for a visit.
his father just dumped him here for four weeks.
Gaby became the object of victor's desire.
have you not noticed? I'm a catch.
I have noticed, and I'm throwing you back.
and as Mike struggled to recall his past, Ian's jealousy spurred him to action.
will you be my wife?
Yes!
God, I'm so nervous.
don't be.
they're going to adore you as much as I do.
Oh, thanks. I needed to hear to that.
Ah! Darling...thorns.
Oh! Uh, I'm so sorry.
if there was one thing Ian Hainsworth was sure of, it was that his love for Susan Mayer was indestructible.
he knew this because it had been tested again...
and again...
and again.
still, Ian had found a way to forgive Susan her occasional lack of grace.
Oh! Here they come.
the question now on his mind was, would his parents be able to do the same?
father. - My dear boy.
these are my parents, Graham and Dahlia.
delighted.
you weren't exaggerating. She's a vision, Ian.
Oh, it's so great to finally meet both of you.
Oh, this is for you.
be careful, mother!
thorns.
Ian, I know how to hold a rose.
Yes, of cour--of course. I just didn't want susan to...
you're right. Sorry.
anyone hungry?
Yes.
so one puts the meat atop the burning coals oh, how wonderfully primal.
Yes, I'll feel like some gloriously rough-hewn cowgirl enjoying her...
uh, what's the word?
"Vittles"?
no, that can't be right.
no, it is. It's vittles.
Yes.
so, um, can I get you something to drink?
I'd adore just a thimble of gin.
Oh, no, you stay, darling.
I-I-I can manage.
well, it seems to be going rather well...
touch wood.
were you worried?
Oh, well, you don't have to tell me.
the first time I met Dahlia's parents was a complete disaster.
we were at tea...
and there was this plate of small cakes.
and I-- as I offered one to her mother, I tipped the plate, and plop!
a scone fell right into her ladyship's teacup.
Ouch! Ha!
Earl grey everywhere!
on the cloth, her mother's skirt...
you must have been mortified.
Oh, I was. It was an absolute debacle.
um, guys?
Uh...don't worry.
she's all right.
Yes, Ian Hainsworth knew his love for Susan was indestructible.
unfortunately for his mother, chiffon was not.
in every housewife's closet, there's a treasured article of clothing that she refuses to part with.
it might be an old cheerleader uniform that symbolizes her youth...
or the last bikini she wore before she had children...
or a pair of expensive pants she prays will come back in style.
but for gabrielle solis, every piece of clothing was a treasure
carefully selected, beautifully maintained and utterly irreplaceable.
I can't believe you bought another bustier.
I know.
I should never shop for lingerie when I'm horny.
it's like buying groceries when you're hungry.
in a slump, huh?
how long's it been?
about three weeks, and I am dying.
you know, I'm this close to seducing my gardener.
been there, done that.
Mmm, that scrumptious teenager of yours.
Hey, do you think--- he's married.
mm, damn.
how about that Victor Lang?
have you two... - No. God, no.
as a matter of fact, I think I'm dumping him after dinner tonight.
Why?
he's rich. He's gorgeous.
he's probably gonna be mayor.
I mean, what more do you want?
I don't know. He's just too...arrogant.
he acts like I'm some trophy he's already won.
it's infuriating.
Yeah, that's awful.
can I do him?
Oh, stop it.
you cannot be that hard up.
did I mention my gardener's 62?
what the hell is this?
Oh, my god!
No!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
honey, where's your uniform?
Oh, crap. I left it at home again.
Yeah, um, I figured you would again.
that's why...
I pulled an extra one from the back.
Oh. Thanks.
are you sure it's the right-- Yep, your size.
listen...
I was thinking, wouldn't it be better if the staff wore a uniform, and you and I wore regular clothes?
that's way it's like, "hi. Welcome to scavo's."
we're the scavos.
Yeah, but I like wearing the uniform, and when you don't, it looks like we all work for you.
Oh, good point.
okay, here's another good point-- I hate orange.
since when?
since always.
you know my closet.
surely you've noticed I don't own anything orange.
no, I hadn't really--- orange says,"beware. Something bad's gonna happen."
that's why they use it for life vests and traffic cones and convicts.
Lynette--- also, it washes me out completely.
you're wearing the uniform.
are you speaking as my husband or as my boss?
definitely your boss.
your husband
too damn scared of you.
as well he should be.
as Edie walked home, all she could think of was her nonexistent love life...
pass it to me, carlos!
and how much she wanted back in the game.
it was just then she saw someone she might like to play with.
Hi! - Hey.
did you see that, Edie?
kid's looking good, huh?
Mmm, looking real good.
can we play another game?
no, it's lunchtime.
you go wash up.
Bye, Carlos. - Bye.
Oh, you have been so great with Travers.
let me take you out for steak tonight.
you don't have to pay me back.
I'm having more fun than he is.
well, then...
we'll just have to arrange for another playdate.
anytime.
look who's back.
Yes. Let's try this again, shall we?
dahlia, I am so sorry about the--- please, not another word.
chiffon at a barbecue?
I was asking to be immolated.
a drink with dinner, mother?
Oh, good, yes.
Oh, not that chair. That's the wobbler.
I'm saving up for a new set.
here, sit here.
Ian tells us you have a young daughter.
won't she be joining us?
Julie? Uh, no, she's at her father's this weekend.
Oh. Is something wrong?
Oh, it's just that Ian told us that your husband had been gone for years.
we assumed you were a widow.
Oh! no, karl's alive and kicking...sadly.
what happened?
did he beat you?
uh, no. Of--of course not.
she had ample grounds, mother.
Karl was a shameless womanizer.
so it was just adultery.
just adultery?
to my way of thinking, men are, by nature, weak.
I think Graham will back me up on that.
really, Dahlia.
if you want your marriage to last...
when your husband strays, you extract some suitable penance...
and get on with it.
punish the sin, but love the sinner.
Yeah, well, with Karl, I was more, "divorce the ass and seize the assets."
so you better watch out.
betrayal makes me vengeful.
well, that's good to know.
Yes, it certainly is.
apparently, the water heater in the attic had burst.
everything is ruined-- my clothes, my shoes, dresses.
why are you smiling?
well, we have different perspectives.
you see ruined clothes, and I see a woman who could suddenly use a rich boyfriend.
you will never be my boyfriend.
Gaby, how much longer are you gonna pretend you're not crazy about me?
not much longer. This is our last date.
hmm, didn't you say it was our last date on our last date?
I mean it this time.
yeah? Well, do me a favor-- mean it next time.
I'm getting an award tomorrow at the rotary club.
bor-ing.
come on, I want my date to be the most beautiful woman in the room.
is that supposed to flatter me?
only if you've never seen the women of the rotary club.
Oh, shut up and get me a sweater.
have you even noticed how cold I am?
noticed?
it's made my whole evening.
Sweater--now.
how about a nice, uh, cashmere cardigan?
Oh, my god!
what?
look at this!
there's lacroix and ungaro and vintage gaultier.
Yeah, I don't really know much about fashion.
Shh! They can hear you.
Oh, my god! There's another rack back here!
this all your ex-wife's stuff?
Yeah.
she's storing it here until her new house is ready.
Oh, my god!
she wears my size!
it's amazing. Nobody wears my size.
well, I guess I have a type.
and normally that would creep me out, except it means that I can borrow this one-of-a-kind undari for our date!
whoa, whoa, whoa. Heel, girl.
this belongs to my ex. - so?
I don't think she'd appreciate me loaning her clothes to my girlfriend.
Okay,"a," I'm not your girlfriend, and "b,"she's not gonna find out unless you tell her.
come on!
a dress this gorgeous is meant to be seen.
every day it hangs in the closet, an angel loses its wings.
well, that's very cute, but, uh, the answer's still no.
come on. Let's go.
I just wanted a moment to say good-bye.
so in the next scene, the guy wakes up, and the girl--Julia Roberts, Sandra Bullock, one of those
is standing there holding a tray of pancakes.
what happens then?
I keep telling you, I don't remember.
what's the difference?
it's just some stupid movie I saw.
yet every time you remember it, you feel sad or upset.
I think something happened at that movie or just afterwards.
who did you see it with?
well, it's obviously some chick flick...
so probably susan.
well, why not ask her about it?
maybe she can tell you what happened.
no. No, I don't want to bother her.
she just got engaged.
Mike, this therapy isn't just about recovering your memories.
it's about you getting closure.
now the emotions you're feeling won't be resolved until you know whathey're about.
I don't know.
come on. Talk to susan.
what could it hurt?
that's awesome. I love model airplanes.
so you'll help me put it together? - Sure.
I'll see you tomorrow after school.
can you come at 7: 00 instead?
why so late?
mom says I can't play till I finish my homework.
Bye.
he's coming.
so can I stay up and watch my show now?
you can stay up as late as you want, champ.
tomorrow...
you are going to have an early night.
your father's been up there 20 minutes.
are you sure he's ok? - He's fine.
he always lies down after dinner.
he says it helps his digestion. Relax. It's going very well.
I set your mother on fire.
and you've been relentlessly charming ever since.
trust me, when she looks back at tonight, she won't even remember the fire.
but she may remember this.
Oh, my god! I'm so sorry! Are you all right?
Yes, I'm perfectly fine.
at least this blouse made it through dinner.
let me get you a towel.
Hello!
Oh, I hope you don't mind.
Dahlia has a birthday coming up, and I saw this hanging there, and I thought, "a robe"!
well, there's a notion.
so I just tried it on...
to get a sense of the drape.
were you also thinking of getting her a lace bra?
Oh, dear god!
please don't mentionhis to any of my family.
just take the robe off.
and whatever you have on underneath...
consider that yours.
be reasonable, dear. I'm only trying to protect you.
from Susan?
well, she doesn't care about my money.
she's never asked me for a cent.
your logic is as wobbly as the dining room chairs she can't afford to replace.
I love Susan, and I won't ask her to do this.
Oh, hello. Mother's fine. I-I found her a sweater.
so, uh, what won't you ask me? - Nothing.
I was wondering if you'd object to signing a document that says should you and Ian part ways, you'll accept a cash settlement and not go after the money he inherits from us.
you mean a prenup?
please try to understand.
our country estate has been in our family for generations.
we want it preserved for the children we hope Ian will have, not lost in some pricey divorce.
well, who's getting divorced?
I'm in this for keeps.
I'm sure you said the same to your first husband before you bolted with all you could carry.
okay, hey--- mother, Susan is not signing anything.
fine.
then we'll leave it all to your brother.
Oh, do you think Nigel's going to give you a grandson?
he's an alcoholic homosexual.
with a castle at stake, he can learn a new skill.
okay, stop this.
we invited you here to celebrate our engagement.
now I'm divorced, and Ian's disinherited?
hello.
have I missed anything? - We'll be going soon.
please, don't be offended.
all of us go into marriage convinced that everything will be perfect.
God knows I did.
and then one day, I found a bill for some expensive lingerie
bustiers, peignoirs-- none of it in my size.
certainly opened my eyes.
but I-I'm not like my father.
trust him, he's not.
I'm sorry, Ian.
Hey, guys.
uh, hey, mrs.Scavo.
I'm--I'm sorry. We were just taking a quick break.
we'll--we'll get back to work.
no. No, don't be silly.
who am I-- Tom?
I'm one of you guys. Sit down.
hey...
you know what we could use?
a good old-fashioned bitch session, get some stuff off our chests.
so what's bugging you guys? Okay, I'll go first.
how do we feel about these uniforms? A little..."eh"?
they're okay.
but, hey, why-- why do we have to pool our tips?
why can't we just keep what we earn?
good point, good point.
but right now we're talking about these ugly-ass uniforms.
you know what bugs me?
no health benefits.
I'm kind of worried about this mole that I found
focus, people! The subject is shirts. It's killing morale.
well, I kinda like 'em. - Really, Kim?
cause...
I heard one of your customers say that when halloween comes around, we should stick a candle in your mouth.
see? Morale.
you guys need to stand up for yourselves.
it's your right
no, it's your obligation to go to management and demand new shirts.
and if management doesn't like it, you tell him he can go screw!
okay, okay.
break's over, people. I'm gonna go find Tom and talk.
Oh! Good.
I can't believe you tried to undermine me like this.
well, you gave me no choice.
it's just a uniform.
why can't you wear it?
because I need to win one, Tom. - What?
you keep ordering me around and disagreeing with me and ovruling me, and I'm sick of it.
we have to do things my way at least every once in a while.
this was the deal, Lynette.
you agreed. I'm in charge here.
you're in charge at home.
except we're never home. We live here.
our marriage happens here.
okay, you know what? We can't talk about this now.
we open in ten minutes.
maybe later we can--- later I'll be asleep, and then I will be back here before you wake up.
we gotta deal with this now.
okay, all right...
we're gonna deal with this now.
I'm gonna get ready for the dinner rush, and you're gonna wear the damn uniform.
no. - What?
I'm going home.
you're walking out on me?
I told you orange meant something bad was gonna happen.
Hi. Remember me?
I had dinner here the other night.
anyway, I was driving through your neighborhood after having, like, three iced teas, and I really have to go to the bathroom. Do you mind?
you and I are gonna be so happy together.
I feel 10 pounds lighter. Thank you.
Hey, you got a minute?
I, uh, i need your help with something.
I should probably get these inside. - Please, I...
I need to ask you about a movie.
and so the last part I remember, the girl is putting these raw pancakes in front of him, and then something else funny happened.
I don't remember. It was just a stupid chick flick.
Mike, it wasn't a movie. That was us.
what? - Yeah.
that was the first night that we spent together.
I wanted to surprise you.
with raw pancakes?
well, they weren't all raw.
I was trying to spell "mike," and the "m" was goopy, but the "ike" was delicious. You loved it.
I did, huh?
actually, no, it was gross.
but you were really sweet.
you just gave me a lot of kisses and said not to worry,
I'd get a lot of chances to make you pancakes 'cause...
cause I was planning on spending the rest of...
my mornings with you.
you remember.
Yeah.
I should go 'cause, um, Ian's parents are here.
it's nice to see you.
thank you both for coming.
you know, I-I know I've said it ten times, but you look fantastic.
and my offer still stands.
you do not have to pafor my dress.
come on. You only needed it for my luncheon, and it looks like it cost a bundle.
trust me, it was a steal.
I'm gonna go powder my nose, and then you can start showing me off.
Heads-up-- I just saw your ex-wife.
Ugh, what is she doing here?
some friend of hers is getting a plaque, too.
you want to duck out after your speech?
are you kidding?
I can't wait till she gets a good, long look at gaby.
Hey. Hello.
I love your dress.
Thanks.
it's one-of-a-kind, isn't it?
Yeah, couture.
Mm. Undari?
wow, good eye.
well, I do have an unfair advantage.
I bought it.
so you're, uh... - uh-huh.
well, first, let me just say you have amazing taste.
if we had met in any other context, we would so get along.
I left those clothes with victor so he could store them, not loan them to his sluts.
okay, you're mad, so I'm just gonna blow right by that slut crack.
I want my dress back now.
okay, let's be reasonable.
you can't wear two dresses to one lunch.
it's not like I have a spare in the car.
not my problem.
give me back the dress.
go ahead. Yell all you want.
you can't force me to take off this dress.
this is pepper spray.
in three seconds, your eyeballs will be on fire.
could you help me with the clasp?
Hello, Samantha. I heard you were...isn't that Gaby's dress?
Gaby? You in there?
Hey, victor.
uh, you're probably wondering why I've been in here so long.
funny story-- I ran into your ex-wife.
Yeah, she, uh, brought me up to speed.
okay, it's time for bed, Travers.
but I wanna show carlos my new turtle.
Oh. Right. I'm tired.
that's okay, buddy. I gotta get going anyway.
Hey, you haven't even finished your wine.
sorry, early day tomorrow.
come on, kiddo. I'll tuck you in.
sleep tight, Travers.
Oh, no! I'm such a klutz. I think I broke it.
Nah, nah, it's just a flap. I can fix that.
yeah?
I can't see what I'm doing here.
Oh. I'm sorry.
maybe I should watch so that if it breaks again, I can fix it.
okay, um, so this hinge needs to go in at this angle...
so that the flap works.
Mmm. See?
God, you're so mechanical.
Edie, what are you doing?
learning about flaps.
Nah, I think you're coming on to me.
maybe.
okay, Edie, no. Come on.
we're close friends, and I don't want to ruinhat.
Oh, we're not that close.
let's just do it and see where it goes.
okay, you know what? It wouldn't go anywhere.
why not?
mm, 'cause...I'm looking for a girl who wants to settle down and be in a serious relationship, and you're not that type.
Oh? What type am I?
You're...the fun type, who likes to dress sexy and go out and meet new people, and then go out the next night and meet another...new people.
you think I'm promiscuous?
I'm just saying, for a house on a cul-de-sac, this place sees a lot of traffic.
just because I'm popular doesn't mean that I'm incapable of a lasting commitment.
look, you can't even commit to your kid.
he's here for a month, and you keep dumping him on neighbors so you can go shopping.
that is, when you're not using him for sex bait.
get out of my house.
Tom, it's me again.
you should've been home 30 minutes ago.
I know. You're still mad.
I am, to so why don't you come home and we can be mad together?
see you soon.
so what kind of orange is this shirt?
like a salmon or a coral?
Oh, cheese doodle.
exactly, and I'm supposed to wear that every damn day.
Oh, please. It's not that bad.
I once worked at this fish-and-ch place.
I had to wear an eye patch and a stuffed parrot on my shoulder.
would you like to hear arrr specials?
why dot you just tell Tom to pick another color?
this isn't about the shirt anymore.
this is about us working together.
every day it's a battle.
it's hurting our marriage.
you know what?
I'll just tell tom I need to step back.
you mean quit?
Yeah. We could hire a manager or something.
Wow. How do you think tom's gonna feel about that?
well, once he decides to stop hiding, I can ask him.
you know what? I'm tired of waiting.
I'm gonna go down there and I'm gonna talk to him.
see you guys later.
so I guess this means we're babysitting the kids, huh?
guess so.
I'm an idiot. Would you guys mind...
we got it. Just go.
Tom! Come on!
I know you're still here.
you realize what time it is?
I know! You're mad.
but you just...you can't avoid me all night.
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Oh, Tom. Tommy...
okay, okay, you're breathing.
that's good.
Hello? Hi. There's something wrong, yeah, with my husband.
I don't--I don't know. He's unconscious.
357 Hawthorne place.
okay, could you please hurry?
thank you. Yes.
listen to me.
I forbid you to die.
if you leave me with a mortgage and a restaurant and five kids,
I swear I will track you into the deepest pit of hell and make you pay.
do you hear me?
come on, baby...
Oh, please.
so that's it? He threw out his back?
Oh, thank god.
I'm guessing he passed out from the pain.
Mm. But I wanna be clear.
a ruptured disc is very serious.
he'll need surgery.
it'll be a while before he's back on his feet.
how much of a while?
we, three months.
three months?
even then, he'll need to go easy.
what sort of work does he do?
we run a restaurant.
Mm. He shouldn't go back for four or five months.
restaurant work is very stressful.
Yeah, it is.
what's that? - Oh, it's the prenup my parents want you to sign.
and you brought it to bed?
okay, romance tip number one
sorry. I just can't get that off my mind.
I keep thinking, why all this godly fuss?
Susan's not in this for money and heirlooms.
thank you. I don't want your family's stuff.
what am I gonna do with half a castle?
exactly.
so why not just sign it? - Huh?
well, I mean, looking at it rationally, what's the difference between making the promise you just made to me and making the same promise on paper?
Um...well, the difference is huge.
I mean, one way you're trusting me, and...
and the other way, you're trying to make it official.
but isn't that what marriage is-- making your love official?
Ian, do you really want to start our life together making me feel like...
I'm on probation?
you know that I trust you.
this isn't about my fears. It's about my parents.
Really?
I think it's about someone else.
he just wanted me to help him remember something.
who? Mike.
I saw you watching us.
we were just talking.
I never thought anything else.
okay, I'll sign it.
W-well...at least read it first.
I don't need to. I trust you.
Oh. Hi, Mike.
so tell me. I've been dying to know.
did you talk to Susan?
could she remember what the movie was?
Actually...no.
Ah, well, hang in there.
we'll figure it out.
it's just a matter of time before everything starts coming back.
here, have a seat.
uh, listen, you've been really helpful the last few months, but I think I'm done here.
Mike, I-I know this can be a frustrating process.
but if you give up now, there are so many memories that could be lost to you.
Yeah, I'm okay with that.
Oh, my god. How many did you take?
sorry. I wanted options.
stop judging me. I was hopped up on couture.
Hey, you know, it's not funny. Samantha called her lawyer.
what? Yeah. Over a dress?
God, what a bitch.
Hey! Don't call her that.
she threatened me with mace and then slugged you.
now you're on her side?
Gaby, I didn't marry an angry woman. I just divorced one.
what happened? Did you have some little mistress on the side?
worse. I treated her like she was the mistress.
I set her up in a nice house, I gave her an allowance...
and then I-I came and went as I pleased.
she was always there when I needed her, but if she needed me, well...
and if she wasn't happy, she could always go out and buy a nice new dress.
you saw the closet, so you know just how happy she was.
what?
I've known you for two weeks, and this is the first glimpse of a guy I could actually like.
a clueless, emotionally stunted workaholic?
a guy who can admit he screwed up, one who's not trying to impress me every second of the day with how perfect and charming he is.
I wouldn't mind seeing more of that guy.
well, his schedule's wide open.
how about dinner tomorrow night?
I'd love to.
although what am I gonna wear now?
doesn't matter.
cause I'm just gonna talk you out of it.
look who's back-- Mr.Cocky.
he never leaves for long, does he, that guy?
are there any points you'd like to discuss before you sign?
I'd like you to say, "we don't need this. we trust you."
but you don't, so, uh, I'll sign it.
and once I do, I am going to earn your trust by being a good wife to Ian.
well, we're sure you will be.
um, sign all three copies, please.
I mean it. I am going to be loving and faithful and above all, honest.
there'll be no secrets with Ian.
I'll tell him everything.
well, we applaud your candor.
what I'm trying to say is, there'll be no topic that I need to...skirt, no issue that I won't...address.
I won't conceal my true thoughts under garments of secrecy.
good for you. Now if you'll just sign
Oh, for god sakes, Dahlia. Anyone can see she's not a fortune hunter.
graham, what are you doing?
she is willing to sign.
which proves she can be trusted.
I'm sure you'll be a good wife to Ian.
you can count on it.
I'm sorry , carlos.
thanks for the flowers.
you're welcome. come on.
you know, about Travers-- you can see him if you want.
he misses you. - I miss him, too.
Oh, and just so you know, he's at a sleepover, so I didn't leave him alone with a six-pack and some matches.
look, Edie, um...
what I said about you the other day was-- dead-on.
you nailed me, Carlos.
maybe not the way that I wanted you to, but still...
but I had no right to judge you.
besides, the guys, the clothes, the partying-- that's you.
I mean, that's the Edie that we love.
well, I'm glad you love her, because I'm getting pretty tired of her.
come on. - I'm a 40-year-old party girl.
do you think that I don't know that my days are numbered?
yeah...I don't know what you want me to say here.
don't say anything. Just...
stop seeing the person that I've been and start seeing the person I could be.
look at me, not the Edie that I show the world.
in fact...let's lose her.
forget the blouse that she wears because she knows it shows off her cleavage.
uh, Edie, what are you doing?
and the skirt...
that's so short, because she knows that guys love long legs.
and the heels...
the ones that make her legs look even longer.
Edie, please.
forget the bra that holds her breasts a little higher than they are on their own these days.
and the panties...
the ones that hide the scar from my c-section.
this is it.
Hi, Carlos.
I'm Edie.
I might not be the woman that you thought I was under all of that...
but I'm real, and I'm here.
and I'm asking for a chance.
Oh. Hey, Andrew.
Aw, thanks. He's gonna be okay.
no. No, absolutely not.
we will open tonight as usual.
Hey, it's gonna be fine, Andrew.
I will take care of it.
it's my job now.
Mm-hmm. Okay. See you soon. Bye.
in every housewife's closet there's an article of clothing that tells you more about its owner than she would want you to know.
it might be a shirt that she despises but wears without complaint.
perhaps it's some lingerie she knows isn't hers but refuses to discuss...
or a dress she once loved...
that she can no longer bear to look at.
Yes, you can learn a lot about women from what they choose to wear.
you can learn even more by what they choose to take off, and who they take it off for.
maybe you haven't noticed, but I'm in love with you.
Victor caught gaby by surprise...
why would a four-star chef wanna slum at a pia joint?
Lynette took a gamble...
he has a history...using cocaine. - No, no way.
well, but he's been clean for almost a year.
Mike bet on love...
I win, you leave me and susan alone.
and lost...
don't panic.
but still came to susan's rescue.
you okay?
Yeah.
and mrs. Mccluskey revealed her secret for a lasting relationship.
it was late on a tuesday night when the power went out all over fairview.
for most of the residents, it was a minor inconvenience.
but for those with secrets, the darkness proved quite useful indeed.
Millie russell was able to indulge in another night of midnight binging.
Timmy cooper was ableo sneak another peek at his father's adult magazines.
Marilyn quinn was able to steal a few more puffs of her forbidden tobacco.
but these secrets paled compared to the one a certain old woman was hiding in her basement.
you sit tight, Ida.
I got batteries here.
no, I keep them in the freezer for just such an emergency.
I'll run 'em over to you.
by the way, you wouldn't happen to have any extra ice laying around, would you?
no, I've just got some stuff in my freezer I don't want thawing out anytime soon.
Yes, as a rule, darkness helps us keep our secrets safely hidden.
Oh, crap!
but every rule...
Karen, what's happened?
are you okay? ...
has its exceptions.
when the lights went out on wisteria lane, Karen Mccluskey wasn't the only reside left in the dark.
everyone else felt the pain of going without power as well.
Ow! Damn! Thumbtack!
Susan, please let me help.
no, no, I got it.
Oh, wait.
here we go.
but it's hardly a long-term solution.
well, at least it'll keep me from stabbing myself while I look.
but this is silly.
why don't we just borrow a flashlight from mike?
he's a plumber. He's bound to have a spare.
sure, but we can't keep leaning on him for everything.
Mike, we're drowning. Save us.
Mike, it's dark. Give us a flashlight.
let's go ask gaby.
actually, I wanted to talk to him anyway.
I thought we might ask him over for dinner.
dinner?
you know, as a-- as a thank you gesture.
well, Ian, you've tasted my cooking.
it's not a thank you.
it's revenge.
well, then I'll cook.
you know, you told me I should put my jealousy behind me.
I think breaking bread together would be a great start.
well, let's not bother him tonight.
you know, I don't really even need a flashlight.
my eyes have totally adjusted to the dark.
what was that?
don't walk in the kitchen.
anyway, where is your sense of romance?
it's a blackout.
you have a defenseless lady.
getting any ideas?
well, I-I-I'm starting to, yes.
it's funny.
all that time I wasted worrying mike would come between us
it seems so laughable now, doesn't it?
kiss me.
Hey, carlos, we had a blackout.
you need a flashlight?
Carlos, you okay?
Oh, uh, sorry, man.
I thought I heard a thud.
I just, um, bumped into a chair.
I didn't think that you were coming home till tomorrow.
Nah, fish weren't bitin'.
so, uh...
you got a girl in here?
no.
Why?
Oh, 'cause when I came home, I thought I heard sex nois.
no, that was just me.
okay.
night.
Oh, god, that was close.
all this sneaking around is ridiculous!
Mike and I dated for...five minutes.
he's not gonna care.
what if travers finds out?
look, I don't want him to be confused, and until we figure out where this is going, I just...think we should keep things on the down low.
Hey, I didn't say we had to stop.
I just said we had to quiet. - What?
I suppose we should tiptoe around like schoolchildren so our parents don't catch us doing it?
I feel like I'm 12 again.
I'm just saying, I don't think that the whole world needs to know our...
12?
okay, look...
I will find us another place to rendezvous.
but I'm not gonna skulk around forever.
and no one's asking you to.
I respect you too much for that.
if you don't mind...
Oh, for god sake...
I'm gonna be right there.
here you go.
so can you still cook with the power out?
of course!
Absolutely!
please, please, tell me we can still make pizza.
no dice.
some genius installed pizza ovens with electric starters.
Oh, this is awful.
on a good night, we barely break even.
tonight is gonna kill the whole week.
not necessarily.
the stovetop's gas.
I bought pasta for the staff dinner.
you give me ten minutes,
I'll whip up a spaghetti carbonara that'll knock their socks off.
Oh, my god!
you are a lifesaver!
and, uh, since it's not on the menu, you can charge whatever you want
say, 20 bucks?
for pasta? Are you crazy?
won't hurt to ask.
Oh, I don't wanna scare them away.
okay.
okay.
so...
good news!
our chef is preparing his special spaghetti carbonara.
Ooh, yummy!
and we're offering that for $12.
great!
for the appetizer portion.
fine.
2. 22.$
okay.
shouldn't there be an emergency light?
sometimes in these elevators there's a...
Ta-da!
well, aren't you clever?
I'll just call hotel security and let 'em know we're
no, wait!
this is the first time I've had you to myself all night.
I'm sorry.
it's those fund-raisers.
everybody wants a piece of the candidate.
what are you doing?
taking my piece.
are you insane? We're in an elevator.
exactly.
going down...
No! come on.
cut it out.
the power could come on at any moment.
I know.
that's what makes it so exciting--the risk.
but, uh, I-I'm kind of running for mayor here, remember?
it's an elevator, silly.
it has an emergency stop button.
I don't.
Oh, my god, that's amazing!
what are you doing?
that's my phone.
it's on vibrate.
Oh, god!
Oh, man, I was just starting to get into it.
less talking, more dressing.
you two okay?
Yeah, fine, thanks.
must've gotten pretty hot in there.
you have no idea.
Karen, don't worry about a thing.
I'll collect your mail till you get back.
well, how long's this blackout supposed to last?
well, they say it may last for days.
days?!
Uh...hey, Blondie, come here.
come here.
Hey, listen, I don't really need to go to the hospital.
I'm fine.
you fractured a rib, and you might ve a concussion.
you need looking after.
no, some of the stuff in my freezer might melt.
how about I just run out and get some ice and then meet you at the hospital?
ma'am, you can replace groceries.
you don't understand.
some of my groceries-- they-- they have sentimental value.
sorry.
Yeah, well, I don't need to ask your permission.
ma'am, no!
get your hands off me, you big ape!
get the restraints.
I'm gonna sue your ass!
Hey!
well, what are we waiting for?
get me to the hospital.
I'm not a well woman.
what was that all about?
your friend's afraid the stuff in her freezer is gonna spoil.
Oh, well, thank god the power's back on.
now she won't have to worry.
I made you waffles!
eat 'em while they're hot.
what?
will you marry me?
they're just toaster waffles.
Ah, that was just the pre-proposal, actually.
the real one will be much more romantic with a big diamond the size of a doorknob.
but just so you're prepared, I do wanna marry you.
well, just so you're prepared, consider this my pre-refusal.
come on. What's wrong?
you're wearing my shirts.
you burn my breakfast.
you're here every night.
it's like wee married already.
we're having a good time.
why risk ruining it?
see, what happened to the thrill seeker that seduced me in the elevator?
she wouldn't be afraid of taking a little risk.
Oh, you don't wanna marry her.
she's a tramp.
hold out for a good girl.
no, no, no.
I've found what I'm looking for.
come on. What gives?
look, Victor...
getting divorced really kicked my ass.
I'm sorry. Just...
next time I get married, I've gotta be sure.
okay, I get it.
I just wish there was a way I could prove how much I love and ore you.
well, if you canhoke down that lousy waffle I made you, that'd be a start.
Oh, there's Mike.
should we see if he's free friday night?
Yeah. Yeah, why not?
sure.
you know what? Do you wanna run this ice cream side before it melts?
look, Ian is going to come invite you to dinner Friday, and you are not--I repeat-- not going to accept.
why is Ian inviting me to dinner?
he wants to thank you for saving us, and he wants to show that he's not jealous of you.
how's that for irony?
I didn't plan to kiss you, but you didn't exactly resist.
I was in shock.
why were you so upset when you mentioned Ian?
because we had just had a fight...
about you.
Really?
you talk about me a lot?
Mike, I am marrying Ian.
we have hired a caterer.
we are going with the salmon, so just back off!
Hey, Ian.
Hi, Ian.
I just asked Mike.
he can't make it.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I've got plans tonight.
Oh, but didn't we say Friday?
Friday?
Oh, Friday I'm wide open.
splendid!
shall we say 7: 30?
it's a date.
Mrs. Epstein!
listen, I'm late for my Hadassah meeting.
here's the key.
take your time.
Oh, and don't be shy.
check out those closets.
they're very spacious.
Edie, what are we doing here?
checking out a house.
I told you, I'm not looking to buy right now.
well, who's talking about buying anything?
I...Am giving it away.
Edie, we cannot have sex in here.
it's someone else's bed!
that's just wrong!
look, we can't use my place.
we can't use yours.
but I'll be damned if I am gonna pay for a hotel room when there are all of these empty houses all over town that I have the keys to.
though reluctant at first, Carlos soon saw the wisdom in Edie's plan.
secret affairs e a lot like real estate.
the three keys to success are...
location...
location...
location.
careful. I can't sit down that fast. - Sorry. I'm sorry.
but it's gonna be worth it.
okay, so tell Tom the secret of your risotto.
well, I saut spinach and onions in white wine
no, no, the profit margin.
uh, basically, it costs a dollar to make
and we charge $20!
4 people who would've shared a $15 izza are now spending 80 bucks.
okay, kids, dig in!
there's just one little problem with that, Lynette. - Yeah?
those families you're talking about have kids, and there's no kid that's gonna eat anything with spinach in it.
it's delicious, huh?
Mm-hmm! Oh, yeah!
yeah?
Rick learned how to make this in Italy.
go ahead.
try it.
I wanna see what you think.
it's good.
it's awesome!
it's good.
But?
but it's just not us.
us?
what is us?
look, we're a neighborhood pizza place.
we serve pizza.
I like this better.
I'm getting bored of pizza.
porter, the adults are talking.
look, we serve good food at good prices.
we're not looking to be the next, you know, trendy flash in the pan.
that's--that's not what I'm looking for either.
um, see, my food-- it's not trendy.
it's classic.
obviously you're a great cook, and when you have your own place,
I will definitely eat there, but I see no reason to change my menu.
more, please!
Hi! Can I help you?
uh, yeah, I'm here to see Mr. Lang.
he's not here. Is that for him?
Yeah. But it's very persal.
okay. - I don't think I should leave it with the maid.
do I look like the maid? Give me that!
Victor Lang if you want the negatives. I demand 50, 000! Do not call the police! I will contact you!
you! Blackmailer!
Oh, man, you weren't supposed to look!
get off of me!
Ow! No!
$50, 000? Are you insane?!
no, that's not for you to decide!
I want all the negatives of those photos, or I start breaking fingers!
no, you can't break my fingers!
come on! Aah!
give me the pictures!
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, break it up! Break it up! Come on! Come on!
she's crazy! She's crazy!
that's for calling me a maid!
he works the hotel security monitors.
that's how he got the photos.
that miserable cockroach.
well, if you wanna smack him around a little, I can go inside and turn up the radio.
again, no, thank you, but I will need those photos.
Oh, no, no, I'm gonna hang on to these.
they're a little revealing.
ma'am, we can't charge him without evidence, and if he walks, he can do what he wants with the originals.
Okay...yeah.
but guard them with your life.
Yeah, especially that one.
we've been open for three months now, and we've barely turned a profit!
we are building a customer base! That takes time!
go on, ask her.
no, you ask her!
why are you being so stubborn?
and you would rather see the restaurant fail than succeed with Rick's idea!
and I can't believe that you two are ready to toss out my concept.
you know, why don't you just rename the restaurant "lynette and rick's"?
can we have fudgsicles? - no!
sorry, lynette, but the menu is not changing. End of discussion.
I don't think so.
I'm giving it a try.
that's not your decision to make.
yeah? Well, then why don't you come down to the restaurant and stop me?
Oh, that's right. You can't.
I told you she'd say no.
ms. Mccluskey always has some fudgsicles.
Yeah, but she's in the hospital.
Where's the ice cream?
she didn't have any.
Oh, man!
there wasn't anything good in there? - No.
lang sexcapade caught on tape!
what the hell were you thinking?
how was I supposed to know the cops were gonna release the photos to the press?
everybody in town knows the police chief is the mayor's brother-in-law--everyone!
enough, Jerome!
I want you to organize a press conference, and then I want you to help me prep for it.
well, this is gonna be a bloodbath. I don't know how you're gonna prep.
just get me a bucket of piranhas, and I'll stick my head in it.
you know, you're a single guy. Maybe people won't care.
I'm running a family values campaign, and I had sex in an elevator.
I think they will care.
look, I know this is my fault, so if you wanna bite my head off, go ahead.
you know, Gaby, there are only two things that matter to me these days-- my campaign and you.
and if I had to lose one of them, I'd rather it was the campaign.
is there anything I can do?
uh, yeah, you can stick around on election night.
I have a feeling I'm gonna need some serus consoling.
Mmm! God, that is so good!
I know. It's hard to decide, huh?
no. No, I'm gonna go with the crab cakes and the little quesadillas.
well, all we need is a wedding cake, and we're done.
you are the most decisive bride I've ever met.
I just guess I'm in a rush.
Oh? Oh, gotcha.
well, don't worry. You are not showing at all.
Oh, no, no, no. No, I'm not pregnant.
no, I just know know what I want, which is Ian.
so I'm just eager to...you know, no- not get it over with perse, but just to...
get to the good part, which is the marriage...to Ian.
seems like a great guy.
I don't suppose he has a brother.
Oh, so you're not seeing anyone?
no, I'm between disappointments.
well, are you free for dinner tomorrow?
is this some lame setup?
please say yes.
well, there's this guy coming to dinner, and he is single and handsome and charming and...
you had me at "guy."
so how do you know him?
Oh, uh...he's just a neighbor.
Hey, buddy, whatcha doing? - Nothing.
you seem a little mopey lately. Is everything okay?
Yeah.
can we go see Mrs. Mccluskey?
you guys didn't have to come down here.
no matter what that C. A.T. Scan says, I'm breaking out tomorrow.
well, parker really wanted to come vit you.
I'm gonna put a little water in these.
don't tell your brothers. You were always my favorite.
I saw the man in your freezer.
Lynette! - Yeah?
could you run down to the snack bar and get me some green jell-o?
Oh, sure!
okay, time for a little grown-up talk.
so can you understand now why I had to do what I did?
and how you can never tell anyone, not even your mom?
Hey, they didn't have jell-o, so I hope pudding is okay.
uh...yeah, let's-- let's give it to Parker.
a good boy like him deserves a treat.
what are you thinking about?
Just...this room doesn't really work.
it's just too sterile.
can we go back to that spanish colonial on 3rd?
sure. Fine.
you know what I was thinking?
I'm really happy, and I haven't felt this happy in a long time.
how about you?
are you happy?
Oh, my god!
Oops, sorry. Bed's not made.
Russell! - Why don't you check out the subzero in the kitchen?
it's to die.
well, I see you can't close a sale without opening something else.
Oh, please, I heard about your open house on holly drive.
they're still disinfecting the jacuzzi.
slut. - Bitch.
you think he's gonna tell anyone?
he's a gay realtor. He's speed-dialing as we speak.
then go stop him.
what's the big deal?
who cares if people find out?
I do. - Why?
are you embarrassed to be dating me?
No! it's...you know, if Gaby finds out, she's gonna hit the ceiling.
Oh, why would she care? She's dating that Victor guy.
please, that's not gonna last.
Oh, my god.
you're still in love with her.
no, I just...look, I mean, we've been getting along, and don't wanna...
I don't know who the bigger moron is-- you or me.
Hey, don't be like this.
look, we're having fun, right?
apparently that's all we're having.
Edie, come on!
no, fun's over.
Ah, Mike. Thanks for coming.
thanks for asking me.
Hi. - Um, Mike,
I want you to meet Maggie Gilroy.
I don't believe this.
you're setting me up?
you need to move on, okay?
I don't wanna move on.
I came here to see you.
well, I'm not available, so if you feel like kissing someone tonight, point those lips at Maggie.
here we go--your beer.
did I mention that maggie is an amazing chef?
we're embarrassed to be cooking for her.
stop.
so, um, Mike, do you have a favorite type of cuisine?
Nah. After three months of prison food, everything tastes good to me.
so you were in prison?
he was totally innocent.
Yeah, a woman was bludgeoned to death, and her blood wound up on my wrench.
Oh, my god.
but he was cleared. All charges dropped.
here. Eat this.
it's just so awful.
I mean, to go to jail for a crime you didn't commit.
Oh, it was just a few months.
now my first stretch for manslaughter...
that was brutal.
my worst cellmate was this guy called "stilts."
when they arrested him, they found a bowl full of ears.
Ow! I-I think that was meant for you.
sorry.
so why don't I just go and brew some coffee?
and, uh, I brought a little surprise for dessert-- wedding cakes for you to sample.
great.
thanks a lot. Now Maggie thinks you're charles manson.
I don't care. I love you.
don't say that.
it's true. I remember everything now.
when I got run over, I was on my way to propose to you.
I don't wanna talk about it. - I do.
what would you have said?
you know what I would have said. It doesn't matter now.
the hell it doesn't. Susan, if you can look me in the eye and tell me that when we kissed, you felt nothing, then I'll just go, but only if you can say that and really mean it.
can you?
who wants wedding cake?
Maggie, these cakes are fantastic.
great. Well, all you have to do is choose one, and we're done.
did you notice the themes?
themes? -Yes.
this one is very british-- fondant icing and toffee ganache.
and this is your classic american-- white cake with buttercream frosting.
so which one do you like the best?
Wow. It's kinda hard to decide.
well, that depends on what you're looking for-- rich and elegant...
or down-to-earth and sweet?
I don't know.
you want to taste 'em again?
no, I know what they taste like.
I'm just torn, okay?
there's no need to get upset. It's--it's just a cake.
it's not just a cake. It's a major decision!
well, hey, if you like 'em both so much, why don't--why don't you have two cakes?
how would that look?
Oh, hey, everybody!
here's my wedding cake.
Oh, and what's that over there?
it's my other wedding cake.
I have to pick, and I will!
so just stop pressuring me, okay?
I'm sorry.
I think I was just having a little sugar rush.
thanks again, and sorry.
seriously, just put it on hold for just a month or two.
excuse me. Am I interrupting something?
no. It's nothing.
I think it's time to level with him.
I just told Susan I want her back.
excuse me?
look, I know it puts a crimp in your plans, and I'm sorry, but I love her.
well, that's too damn bad, isn't it? Because she doesn't love you.
Really?
she didn't seem to mind when I kissed her.
what? Did he just kiss you?
no. It--it was days ago.
and you let him?! - No! He--he pounced.
it was hardly a pounce.
you bastard. We...we had an agreement.
Susan doesn't have to rry you because you won her in a game of cards.
what, he didn't tell you how we played poker for you?
you bet me in a game of poker?
it's not--not how it sounds.
I merely suggested that-- that if I won the hand, then he--he would stop badgering you.
and if he won?
well, I-I forget the exact terms, but the point is, he lost, as I knew he would.
I never would have wagered you if I didn't have a very good hand.
get out! - Susan, please.
you heard her. - You, too.
I've had it with both of you.
you're tugging at me like I'm some kind of wishbone.
you're just upset. - No, I am beyond upset.
you two want a decision? Well, here's what I decide.
there will be no kissing, and there will be no wedding, and there will be no damn cake!
what's this?
uh, pumpkin sage ravioli.
it's a little thank you for taking a chance on me.
are you kidding? I should be thanking you.
we took in 3 grand tight.
Oh, wow. Candles, too?
Yeah, I think we should use 'em all the time.
it softens up the ambience.
so come on. Eat.
Oh. Oh, my god.
if we serve this for tomorrow's special, we will clear 4 grand.
great. Uh...just be sure to run it by Tom.
Why? You know he'll just shoot it down.
I mean, I get it. He's in pain.
he doesn't like being sidelined, but that is no reason to...
you know what? Let's talk about something else.
Yeah, sure.
I mean, unless you'd like to go. You're here so late all the time.
no. No, I like being here.
it beats going home to an empty apartment.
don't you have any friends to hang out with?
my friends come in two varieties-- the ones I drove away bere I got clean and the ones
I should avoid if I wanna stay clean.
Oh, yeah. I gotcha.
you ever wear your hair down?
what? Yeah, sometimes. why?
it looks really good.
you should do it more often.
Oh, well...thanks.
this is delicious. - Thanks.
do you want some more wine? - Sure.
daddy!
the paper has a story about your restaurant.
you're kidding!
well, come--come here. What does it say?
when scavo's pizzeria opened its doors, you could almost hear the city groan, "'just what we need-- another pizza joint.
but with an updated menu from new chef rick coletti...is he the man who cooked us that really, really
Yeah, that's the one.
What--what else does it say, honey?
there's more than just crayons on the table.
the veal piccata is divine, "and the mushroom risotto is an...
E-x-q-u--" - exquisite.
an exquisite treat.
Scavo's has been transformed from a mundane family eatery into the area's hottest
that's enough, Kayla. Daddy's tired.
okay.
more fallout from Lang bang.
okay, I know you guys like a good scandal, but I think the citizens of fairview are more interested in the real issues.
Mr. Lang, given your 15-point drop in the polls, what do you have to say to your constituents?
well, I would ask them to, uh, not base their view of me on a single lapse of...
it's not going very well, is it?
you picked up on that, did you?
who is she, Mr. Lang? Give us a name.
no, I will not identify the woman.
what are you hiding? Is she a prostitute?
No! She's not a prostitute.
I'll answer questions one at a time, people.
that does it.
whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
Gaby, stop, please. Please, stop.
excuse me. Excuse me.
excuse me. I am the woman in the photos!
what are you doing?
standing by my man.
what's your name?
my name is Gabrielle Marquez, and I want you to know, right before those photos were taken, Victor asked me to marry him.
what did you say?
I said, "yes."
I would be thrilled to be Mrs. Victor Lang."
are you gonna get married?
have you set a date?
are you really getting married?
in fact, I was so overcome, that when we were trapped in the elevator,
I seized the moment to...
express my joy.
so this is a love story?
the only reason victor kept it from you was to protect me...
because he's the kind of man who puts a woman's honor before his own, and that's the kind of man you marry.
that's the kind of man you vote for.
where are you honeymooning?
what's that smell?
ma'am.
are you Karen Mccluskey?
that little bastard gave me up, didn't he?
today, at the mayoral candidate's press conference, a woman identified as Gabrielle Marquez, a former model, surprised reporters by announcing her engagement to Mr. Lang.
the only reason he didn't tell you was because he was protecting me.
I don't know if you've heard...
Yeah. I heard.
in a few months, I will be Mrs. Victor Lang.
I just heard on the radio the power company is still having problems, and there might be another rolling blackout today.
do you want me to leave Ida's number in case something happens?
I'm sure I'll be fine.
did you read our review in the paper?
Yep.
okay. I'm off.
power-- it's the type of thing most people don't think about...
until it's taken away.
whether it's the political power of the many...
or a lover's influence over just one...
we all want some sort of power in our lives...
if only to give ourselves choices.
Yes, to be without choices, to feel utterly powerless, well...
it's a lot...like being alone...in the dark.
I saw the man in your freezer.
Mrs. Mccluskey and Parker shared a secret...
you can never tell anyone.
but the secret was discovered.
you bet me in a game of poker?
Susan was forced to make a decision.
get out. There will be no kissing, and there will be no wedding.
Lynette ventured into dangerous territory.
you ever wear your hair down?
sometimes.
looks really good.
Thanks.
are you embarrassed to be dating me?
if Gaby finds out, she's gonna hit the ceiling.
Edie came to a disturbing realization.
Oh, my god. You're still in love with her.
and Gaby took a bold step.
in a few months, I will be Mrs. Victor ng.
I don't know my own strength...
the night of her engagement party, Gabrielle Solis was injured.
but she wasn't hurt by the chauffer who almost slammed a door on her fingers...
or the stranger who almost stepped on her hand...
or the waiter who almost dropped a knife on her wrist.
no, Gabrielle's injury came about in a more unexpected fashion and was caused by someone Gabrielle thought was her friend.
thank you.
so have you told bree about your engagement? - Yep.
she's on the top of a swiss alp and still managed to send a basket of muffins.
you're kidding. - No.
damn things traveled 5, 000 miles, and they were still moist.
I don't know how she does it.
Hey, it's getting late.
let's break out the champagne.
wait, wait.
you're not gonna embarrass me with some sappy toast, are you?
I'm not, but Susan's written a poem.
a poem?
she's reworked the lyrics to "wind beneath my wings."
testing.
one, two, three, testing.
what are you waiting for? Get the champagne.
okay.
thank you.
Hey, Gaby.
Hi, Edie!
so I finally met Victor.
he is so charming.
isn't he great?
I know it's been quick, but he's just so amazing.
so you really love him?
he is the one?
he is, and I've never been happier.
I am so thrilled for you.
Edie, are you okay?
Yes! Oh, yes.
Yes, I'm--I'm fine. I... , oh, sweetie.
don't worry. You're gonna find someone soon.
I just know it.
what?
well, actually, I have found someone.
and I am... crazy about him.
well, who is it?
Oh, no. No, no. Tonight is about you.
Oh, no, no, Edie. Come on.
it would make me happy to know who's making you happy.
Really? - Yeah!
I wanna know who's putting that dopey grin on your face.
well, actually, it's... Carlos.
who?
I've been seeing Carlos.
and this is how Gabrielle Solis came to be injured the night of her engagement party.
and though she seemed to laugh it off, Gabrielle had been cut much, much deeper than anyone could see.
Greg is definitely off the wagon. Last week...
gossip
for most housewives, it's just a harmless form of recreation, an exchange of semi-interesting tidbits concerning the semi-interesting lives of people they know.
that mailman was in Sarah's house over an hour.
packages weren't all he's delivering.
I could smell the whiskey on amy's breath.
it wasn't even noon yet.
Joanne may say that she was off on a religious retreat, but since when does praying make your boobs bigger?
but the time comes in every neighborhood when something very interesting happens, and that's when gossip stops being recreation and becomes... obsession.
what kind of woman would keep her husband's body in the freezer?
for ten years?
it's crazy.
has anybody talked to her?
I've knocked twice.
she's not answering.
Oh, I saw the curtain move.
I think I saw a hand.
Oh, great. Now we know she's watching us.
why should we be embarrassed?
we're not the ones who kept a corpse-icle in the basement.
Oh, that's right.
she babysat your kids.
Oh, please, I don't want to think of how many times she brought them ice cream from that basement.
I mean, Jeez, if you want to keep your husband on ice, at least have a dedicated freezer.
do you think she actually killed him?
uh, yeah.
why else would she have hid the body?
well, so far, she's only been charged with improper disposal of a corpse.
but once they defrost the body and do an autopsy, I guarantee you they're gonna find a bellyful of arsenic.
what's arsenic?
it's just-- it's something yucky, honey.
go on and play with your ball.
go on.
we're trying so hard to protect them from this.
there are just some things that kids don't need to know about.
hell, there's some things we don't need to know about.
would you guys excuse me?
Hey, Edie!
Oh, hi, Gaby!
what's up?
I've been doing some thinking, and you know how... how do I put this?
you know how you feel like sometimes people hate you?
I don't feel like that.
we, you should, 'cause they do.
since when?
since you started doing things to piss people off.
about what?
Oh, I don't know.
off the top of my head... dating your friends' exes.
Oh. Oh, so that big smile on your face the other night was all an act.
you're not fine with me seeing carlos.
Edie, there are a thousand single men in fairview.
why do you have to date my ex-husband?
you're engaged to somebody else!
what do you care?
it's awkward!
it's--it's like if I donated a dress to charity, and I went to a party, and you showed up wearing it.
again, if you gave it away in the first place, then what the hell are you bitching about?
look, Edie, just find your own men and stop snapping up other people's castoffs!
and what if I don't?
then be prepared to suffer the consequences.
Oh, please.
you are as tall as my legs.
what are you gonna do?
you're about to find out.
who is it this time?
um... it's Ian.
you gonna talk to him?
no.
uh, he's got flowers.
I don't care.
looks like it's two dozen roses.
Oh, good. I hope the thorns rip him to shreds.
okay, mom, I know what Mike and Ian did was wrong, but
they bet me in a game of poker.
they made decisions about my life over a hand of 5-card stud.
wrong" does not even begin to cover it.
okay, okay, but there are only two guys in this world who know all of your flaws and have still found a way to love you.
you're just gonna toss 'em both away?
Yes.
I don't need a man.
I don't even need sex.
I went without it the first 16 years...
22 years of my life, and I can go a few more.
this should be interesting.
what?
Mike just walked up.
give it up.
she didn't answer the first ten times.
she's not gonna answer it now.
Oh, this is getting sad.
take it like a brit-- stiff upper lip.
you know what? I've just about bloody had it with you.
I preferred you when you were comatose and pooping in a bag!
well, lucky for you, I don't have that bag right now.
all right, that does it.
uh, excuse me? Guys?
Hi.
um, my mom would really like for both of you to leave.
don't soft-pedal it.
let 'em know I mean business.
uh, 'cause if you-- if you don't, she'll be very, very disappointed.
rip 'em!
so just, um... go home and think about what you've done.
if you want something bitchier, do it yourself!
here we are-- ravioli stuffed with duck confit in a porcini cream sauce.
what do you think?
I think it's a shame you didn't make any for yourself.
Hi, honey.
Hey, I just wanted to say I love you.
aren't you sweet?
what's that noise in the background?
are the boys still up?
Yeah, they don't want to go to bed.
well, of course they don't.
they're kids. You're the dad.
make 'em.
well, I tried, honey, but they wanna wait up for you.
they... they miss their mom.
Ah, is this your way of guilting me into coming back home?
Lynette, the--the restaurant did close a half-hour ago.
Preston, don't throw pudding!
Oh, tom... I'm sorry.
I can't come home.
we're, um... doing inventory, so... it could be a while.
well, okay.
try to hurry? - I will.
I love you. Bye.
inventory?
I know. I'm a horrible person.
I just chose ravioli over motherhood.
I should--I should go home.
Lynette, you got nothing to feel guilty about.
you bust your ass in this restaurant every day to keep it going, and if anybody deserves a little downtime, it's you.
those are shameless rationalizations.
keep them coming.
those, too.
there you are.
what are you doing outside?
some big kids threw eggs at mrs. Mccluskey's house.
Oh, Jeez.
they shouldn't have done that.
we should go talk to her.
no.
it's late.
uh, she probably doesn't want us to bother her.
come on, bud.
bedtime.
so here's what's gonna happen-- we're not talking to Edie anymore.
what do you mean, "we"?
I mean, "we" as in she betrayed me, and you're my best friends, so y're gonna support me because that's what friends do.
and "support you" means... acting like we're in junior high?
I can't believe you're not furious at this.
before she sank her fangs into Carlos, she was dating your ex-husband and Mike.
Yes, and do you know who I blame?
I blame Karl and Mike.
why isn't anybody mad at them?
I mean, let's face it.
the men-- they get away with murder.
they're scum!
okay.
back to Edie... I'm not sure I'm comfortable ganging up on her.
Really?
because I wasn't very comfortable taking your side when you were feuding with Patty Nonroe over the backyard fence line, but I did.
Oh, Gaby, that's not fair.
nobody really liked patty to begin with.
don't even get me started about what I've done for you, okay?
I'm still boycotting madame Kim's day spa because of your botched bikini wax.
Oh, my god. How do you botch a bikini wax?
she will show you later!
the point is, good friends share more than just gossip and brunch.
they share enemies, too.
so are you with me or not?
of course we're with you.
we will give Edie the cold shoulder.
no, no! Not cold, frozen!
I want icicles hanging from that bitch's ears!
Hello?
Hi.
Hey, do you still want me to look at that book report?
daddy helped me yesterday.
you weren't home.
Oh. Okay.
daddy does everything lately.
how come you always come home so late?
well, I'm really busy at the restaurant.
believe me, I come home to daddy just as soon as I can.
you're lying.
what?
you always laugh like that when you're telling a lie.
why would you say that?
because... it's true.
I stay late because there's a lot of work to do, and right now I'm the only person who can do it, and now I have to go to the grocery store because I am the only person who can do that, mm-hmm.
so why don't you go upstairs and finish your homework?
okay.
but it is what you do.
excuse me!
uh, hey!
excuse me.
that's my space!
Yeah, well, I'm parked in it, so that kind of makes it my space.
Hey, uh, I waited for that spot while the guy made three phone calls and flossed his teeth.
you can't just steal it.
it's a parking space!
keep a lid on your hormones, honey.
God! You did that on purpose!
Yeah, and I'm about to do this on purpose, too.
crazy bitch!
what do you think you're doing?!
what are you doing? What are you doing?!
I'm taking my damn space!
get out of my car. Get out of my car.
Hey, hey
say you're sorry.
let me go! - Say it!
okay, okay. I'm sorry.
say, "I'm a rude, arrogant bastard who needs to treat women with courtesy and respect!
I'm a rude, arrogant... how does the rest of it go?
Freeze!
was this man trying to steal your car?
it's my car!
she--she tripped me and grabbed my keys.
is this true, ma'am?
Oh, all right, take his side!
Hey, who you spying on?
she hasn't returned my last two phone calls.
I think something's up.
she's probably just busy.
Yeah, we'll see about that.
I am calling her right... now.
Oh, my god!
what?
she just screened me!
I have been screened!
maybe she's in a hurry.
no, no, no. This has Gabrielle Solis written all over it.
she is turning people against me.
and you're surprised?
I told you how she'd react if she found out about us.
yeah?
well, if she wants to play these schoolgirl games, fine.
cause I invented 'em.
Hi!
Hey, hey!
I just tried calling you.
Oh, really?
my ringer must've been off.
Oh, no prob.
I wanted to invite you and the boys to travers' birthday party on saturday.
Yeah, I'm having this reptile guy, and he's got all these cool snakes and lizards.
Oh! The boys would love that, but unfortunately, I gotta work.
well, that's a shame, because I was hoping you could cater.
cater?
Yeah, I'm gonna need pastas and salads for the parents and at least 20 pizzas for the kids.
wow, that many?
Yeah, and... well, you know kids.
if one has a pizza party, they're all gonna want a pizza party.
hmm, could be good for business.
well, yeah, I guess I could work somethin' out.
Oh, I knew I could count on you!
Mm! Love ya!
I do not have "anger issues."
I was just having a bad day.
you threatened to decapitate a man over a parking space.
a very bad day.
Susan, when someone loses it like you did, there's usually a reason.
are things going okay at work?
work is great.
you could just sign that paper and tell the judge I'm fine.
what about your family?
family's terrific.
seriously, you're just wasting your time here.
how's your love life?
cancel my lunch.
I'm gonna be here for a while.
will you stop ringing that damn...
I'm sorry, Parker.
I thought you were one of those little pissants who keep ringing the bell and running away.
so what's on your mind?
I want you to come back and babysit us.
the new sitter stinks.
your folks hired a new sitter?
Yeah, and she thinks carrot sticks are snacks.
well, that's rough, but... life's like that sometimes.
it doesn't have to be.
if you just told people what happened with your husband, everything could go back to the way it was.
Parker, you see those women over there?
nothing I could say would stop those tongues from wagging.
I'm sorry, kid, but... I just have to wait this one out.
can you imagine?!
I mean, finding out that two men you trusted bet you in a poker game.
I mean, how demeaning is that?!
well, it depends on how you look at it.
men have been waging contests over women for centuries.
I grant you, poker isn't as romantic as, say, jousting, but it shows how they felt about you.
the real question is how did you feel about them?
I told you-- hurt and betrayed.
no, how did you feel about them before this poker business?
well... I was engaged to Ian, so... obviously I loved him.
and Mike? Were you in love with him, too?
how we doing on time? - Susan.
okay, fine, I loved him.
I still love him, and I love Ian.
so I am totally, hopelessly in love with two men.
now we're getting somewhere. This is good.
no, this is horrible!
this wasn't supposed to happen!
I only let myself fall for Ian 'cause I thought mike was lost to me.
and then bang! Suddenly he wants me back, and now I have this choice that I can't possibly make.
I agree. It's tough- - it's devastating!
if I go with mike, Ian's heart will be broken, and Ian does not deserve that.
but how can I reject mike after all he's been through?
so you're just gonna walk away from both of them?
you have to make a choice, sweetie.
you've got two great guys, both of them crazy about you.
to let one go-- well, that's life. It happens.
to let them both go... that's just...
stupid? - Yes.
that would be the clinical term.
sounds great. Thanks.
Hey, how would you like to eat something that's neither pasta nor pizza?
such food exists? Don't tease me.
no, my--my friend Al, he's opening a soul food place...
and sunday night, he wants to test the menu with some of his chebuddies.
he said I could bring someone.
and--and--and you want me to go wi you?
it'll be after we close.
and don't tell me that you hate southern food, 'cause then we can't be friends.
no, I love it.
it's... it's just that's a little late for me, and...
Oh, oh, oh. Okay. I-I just thought it'd be fun.
no, it would be, but sunday nights are kind of crazy.
I'm packing lunches and checking homework...
right, right. No worries. I get it.
you're just, uh, first person I thought of.
you know, maybe i should go.
um... it's part of the job to check out the competition, right?
Yeah, absolutely. It never hurts to see what else is out there.
I agree.
Hey, guys, go check out the snakes.
I'll give you some pizza later, okay?
see you later. - All right, I'll see you later.
Hey, you want some pizza? - Yeah.
there you go.
what are you doing here?
Edie asked me to cater. I know, I'm a total whore, but please don't rat me out to gaby.
Hi, Susan!
I have 30 copies of your book. The kids can't wait for you to sign it.
come on, let's go! Come on, come on!
looks like we're working the same corner.
Yeah, only I didn't know edie was gonna have the party in a park.
what if Gaby see us? - Trust me, we can both relax.
I talked to her this morning, and she's out with Victor all day.
Oh. Well, that's a relief.
go ahead. I dare ya.
Hey! what's going on?
witch
Hey, don't do that! - Why not?
because she's not a witch. - How do you know?
cause she isn't. Don't be a jerk.
what is she, your girlfriend? Parker's in love!
shut up!
Hey, you boys! Knock it off!
Parker, I'm so sorry.
are you all right?
you know, everything would be okay if you'd tell people what you told me.
you can make 'em stop.
Hey, Lynette, it's Gaby.
Victor got pulled into some photo op at the homeless shelter.
so I'm free for lunch. You wanna go with?
I tried Susan but she's not home, which is weird because her car's in the driveway and... so is yours.
where is everybody?
down! Down! Down! Aah!
Lynette, what is wrong with you?!
Gaby's coming.- What?!
I thought you said she was with Victor.
I was wrong. I was wrong. Come on. Follow me. Follow me.
mommy, can I play?
No! Go ride the python!
come on.
rent A Reptile
okay, okay, she's circling the park.
Ugh. I wish she'd hurry. I'm terrified of snakes.
Oh, yeah, I'm more terrified of gaby.
okay, good, good.
we're almost home free... - what?
don't turn around.
Hey, Gaby.- Hi.
what are you two doing here?
uh, what are we doing here?
well, Edie hired me to cater, so it's just business.
I don't know what her excuse is.
you are so dead.
I don't believe it. This is an absolute betrayal of our friendship.
Gaby, she asked me to make 20 pizzas.
I couldn't turn it down.
Oh, this is so delicious.
is that what our friendship is worth to you--20 pizzas?
we had a pact! - Oh, come on, Gaby, be fair.
you put us in a really awkward position.
me?! You two owe me an apology. - No, Gaby, be reasonable.
I am leaving this party right now, and if you two don't come with me, - our friendship is over. - Gaby! Oh, come on!
What?! - Oh! No, I mean it.
Carlos, stop!
put me down! What are you doing?!
stop it! Carlos, put me down!
how dare you maul me like that!
you were ruining travers' birthday party.
what the hell is wrong with you?!
I'm sorry. Betrayal makes me a little cranky.
come on, Gaby, you can't tell Susan and Lynette who they're allowed to be friends with.
it's ridiculous.- I'll tell you what's ridiculous -- you not having the guts to tell me you were dating Edie.
Oh, here it is.
Yeah. I had to find out from her at my damn engagement party.
well, I had to hear that you were engaged to that Victor guy on the news.
I didn't plan it that way.
it was spur of the moment.
Oh, so you just said, hey, what the heck?
you even in love with this guy? - Yes, deeply.
must be nice.
well, aren't you in love with Edie?
we're having fun together, but it'll never be serious.
so... if I'm just dating, and you're in love and getting married...
remind me again why it is that you get to be the angry one.
I'm sorry, Carlos.
you should be.
and for the first time, Gabrielle was willing to let Carlos be with someone else...
Hey! Hey.
because she knew... he still belonged to her.
feel free to take home as much cake as you want. I do not want to be tempted.
I might take a little for Tom and...
Hi, Mrs. Mccluskey. Would you like some cake?
I didn't come for sweets.
I know you people have been talking about me, and I guess the only way to shut you up is to come clean.
so... who would like to hear the gruesome details?
I would. - Um... yeah. If--if you feel like it.
well... first off--and I know this will disappoint some of you-- but I didn't kill Gilbert.
I came home from a weekend in laughlin and found him in front of the tv--dead.
he still had the remote in his hand.
good lord.
it was 2: 00 A. M. So I decided to wait until morning to call the funeral home.
and I went to his desk to make sure everything was in order.
I found his pension plan... and guess what?
in the event of his death, I was not the beneficiary.
who was? - His first wife.
they were married when he started the job-- for two years.
we were together for 34 years, and that idiot didn't change the paperwork.
I not only lost my Gilbert, but I was about to lose everything.
so I, um... I, um...
you put him in the freezer and kept cashing the checks.
well, what else was I gonna do?
besides, after a while, it was kind of nice having him around.
anyway... that's the truth.
you ladies have my permission to pass it along...
not that some of you ladies need it.
probably weren't expecting to see me, huh?
well, after 20 unanswered calls... no, not really.
about that, uh, obviously, have been very confused.
I finally saw a therapist.
actually, it was sort of a court-ordered thing. Anyway...
well, I need to talk to you.
you sound... sure.
I am.
I'm gonna marry Ian.
believe me, this wasn't easy, especially when you started to remember how it was between us.
maybe if the timing had been different... it wasn't.
I'm sorry, Mike.
well, at least I have my memories.
you ready to go? - Yeah.
um, I told kim that we'd be out the rest of the evening and she's gonna lock up.
great. I'll, uh, just get my jacket. - Okay.
Hey! You got a table for seven?
Hey! - Hi! What are you doing here?
well, the kids wanted to surprise you, and it's been forever since we've all had dinner together, so... what--well, how did you here?
I mean, you're not supposed to... drive.
I took a cab, a double-dose of the painkillers, and voil?
you surprised? - Yeah, a little.
we missed you.
Oh, I missed you, too.
Hey, why don't you guys go grab that big table, and I will have rick whip something up for us?
Hi. wow, you smell good.
Oh. It must be the basil. It has a kind of sweet smell.
Hey, Kayla, can you get A... high chair for your sister, please?
Yeah. - all right, who wants pizza?
Oh, hi. Uh, change of plans.
Yeah. Yeah, I see.
but... I'm sorry. You could still go.
Oh, no. No, no. I'll stay. I'll cook for your family.
Thanks. Thank you.
Thanks, sweetie.
you are taking such good care of me.
when's Lynette getting home?
Oh, as soon as she closes up the pizzeria.
Mm. Is that guy rick helping her?
he better be, for as much as we're paying him.
I think Lynette likes him.
sure. He's a nice guy, rd worker.
no, I mean, she likes him, likes him.
what makes you say that?
just something I noticed.
well, good night, daddy.
Mrs. Susan hainsworth-- god, I love the sound of that.
or did you want to keep your name? Because I love the sound of that, too.
as long as I get to call you my wife.
deal.
you do realize we're gonna be blissfully happy, don't you?
I mean, it could actually get a bit disgusting. People might throw fruit.
Oh, I'm gonna lock up down here.
why don't you go upstairs and warm up the bed?
you do realize we're gonna be great together, don't you?
I know.
Hey, Susan. Um, I don't mean to bug you.
there's just so much I didn't get to say.
um, I... god, I'm lousy at good-byes.
anyway, you will always be the best thing that ever happened to me, and, well, I hope you find the happiness you deserve.
Bye. Oh, this is Mike.
Hey, Susan.
um, I don't mean to bug you.
there's just so much I didn't get to say.
um, I... god, I'm lousy at good-byes.
anyway, you will always be the best thing that ever happened to me, and, well,
I hope you find the happiness you deserve.
Bye. Oh, this is Mike.
where are you going?
home... to England.
to England? What's wrong?
well, it's just, um... I don't think this is going to work.
what?
but just ten minutes ago, we were making plans, and you were saying how great we were gonna be together.
I, uh, saw you listening to that message from Mike.
well, Ian, I made my choice.
but not for the right reasons.
you're just trying to honor a promise you made to me.
that's not true.
I will get over him.
you've been trying to get over him for as long as I've known you.
haven't had much luck, have you?
Ian, I love you.
I know you do.
but you love him a little bit more, don't you?
I can't live a life where every time I see you with a faraway look,
I'll wonder if you're thinking of him.
I'm so sorry.
you deserve to be happy.
and so do I.
good-bye, Susan.
Hey, mrs. Mccluskey.
well, it turns out our new babysitter isn't working out too well.
feel up to another tour of duty?
are you sure you want the wisteria witch looking after your kids?
my kids know you're not a witch.
too bad. I could use the leverage.
we missed you. Same here.
I'm gonna need a raise, though.
I'm kinda strapped.
okay.
I just talked to Mrs. Mccluskey, and she is gonna startlooking after our kids again.
that's great! - Yeah.
cause actually, I have been thinking, and... it is time that I got back to work.
what? - Yep. I'm feeling good.
I'm gettin' around better.
but... but the doctor said your recovery would take months, and it's only been six weeks.
well, it's not like I'm gonna, you know, dead-lift a bag of ice, but I can sprinkle cheese on a pizza.
Mm. Besides... I hate making yourun that place by yourself.
I don't mind .- Really?
because before, you said it was killing you.
Yeah, well, you know, it is, but I just don't want you to come back before you're ready.
you might reinjure yourself.
I'll be careful.
the best part is we can finally get rick off the books.
Rick? Why would we want to let him go?
well, I know he's been great, but, um, his salaryis cutting into our profits.
actually, he is bringing inmore than enough business to cover his salary.
I mean, with all thosenew dishes he's been cooking, he's got a lot of fans out there.
does he really?
Yeah. I think firing himwould be a huge mistake.
well, it's just a thought.
well, don't think so much.
just rest and get better.
that's what you need to do.
you gonna be late tonight?
probably. We got a big partycoming in at 10: 00.
So...mm-hmm. I'll just see youin the morning.
I'll be here. - Okay.
Hi, Ida. What's up?
that idiot postmanmixed up our mail again.
Oh, poor mr. Henley. He does seem to be getting worse.
thanks for stopping by.
Hey, have you heardabout mike?
no. Uh, what about him?
he moved. - Moved? What do you mean?
Mona Clarke was up at 2: 00 in the morning with acid reflux, and she saw him pack his car and everything.
well, that doesn't make sense.
Mike wouldn't leave without saying good-bye.
well, he did.
according to Carlos, something bad happened, and Mike just wanted to get the heck out of dodge.
it's a pity. I always liked him.
Gossip-- it's just a harmless form of recreation.
it's careless talk that deals in polite fiction...
I'd love to beassistant manager, but apparently, you haveto flirt with mrs. Scavo to get that job.
it's nasty speculation that's based on not-so-polite fact...
he may be dating Edie, but everyone can see he's still in love with Gaby.
how do we protect ourselves from the venomous sting of such idle gossip?
a-are you the lady who kept her husband in her freezer?
the best way is to just tell the truth...
Yep, that's me. Scary, aren't I?
and wait for people to start talking about someone else.
Victor made himself perfectly clear.
whenever I've truly wanted something, I've always gotten it.
Bree needed to get away.
we're finally taking our honeymoon.
Susan couldn't wait to pop the question.
will you marry me?
Lynette received shocking news.
you can see this-- it could be lymphoma.
why are you so reluctant to make a commitment to me?
because I'm not in love with you.
and Edie... - what if we tried to have a baby?
engaged in a dangerous deception.
when Gabrielle Solis agreed to marry Victor Lang, she was determined to have a very traditional wedding.
she was even more determined to be a very traditional bride.
to that end, the handkerchief in her cleavage was borrowed, the garter on her leg was blue, and the diamonds on her ears were old.
but sadly for Gabrielle, something was missing, and she was about to throw a traditional fit.
it is after 3: 00! Where the hell is Bree with my "something new"?!
I know her plane landed on time. She'll probably be here any second.
God, I should have my head examined for even agreeing to this.
who the hell cares about swiss jewelry anyway?
Gaby, Bree went out of her way to buy you that bracelet.
and, of course, it's the hottest day of the year.
all the guests are out there sweating like pigs.
God, at this rate, my reception's gonna look like the finish line of the boston marathon.
if you're that freaked out, just get married without the bracelet.
are you out of your mind?!
I can't get married without my "something new."
Oh, I have an idea.
I just got a lipstick yesterday.
you could wear that.
I just paid a makeup artist 500 bucks to do my face.
do you really think I wanna march down the aisle looking like just ate a popsicle?
okay, it's your big day, so I'm gonna let that slide.
God, it is 10 after, and Bree is never late!
where can she be?
all right, that's it.
after I finish "tszujing" my hair, tell the preacher it's showtime.
I can't believe my wedding's already ruined, and it hasn't even started.
Hey, I'm starting to get worried about Bree.
maybe we should call. - Yeah.
I'm calling her cell.
it's ringing. - oh, good.
Oh, wow!
Hello, ladies.
is that Bree? She better not have come empty-handed!
Oh, I didn't.
as promised, Bree had arrived with something new.
holy crap!
and she also...
brought the bracelet.
three days earlier
Family--there is nothing more important.
they're the ones we want to laugh with during the good times...
and the ones we need to console us during the bad.
and even though the time comes when they have to leave us, their voices still linger in our minds.
and sometimes we can't help but listen.
a tangled web-- that's what you're weaving.
beat it, mother.
you really think this little scheme of yours is gonna work?
of course it will.
look at him.
he's practically in love with me already.
that's because he thinks you're gonna give him a baby.
wait till he finds out you're still on the pill.
Oh, shut up, would you?!
I just thank the good lord your father didn't live to see this.
well, neither did you.
you died alone in a trailer park watching game shows.
and why should I listen to you?
cause I know what's waiting for you, missy.
this one's gonna leave you like all the others.
you're going to end up old and alone, just like I did.
down here, babe!
I'm making you a fruit smoothie.
chicken or fish?
what?
I haven't gotten your reply card back yet. So chicken or fish?
Oh! Right, your wedding.
I can't go. - Why not?
I'm a jinx.
I went to your last wedding, look how that turned out.
come on, Gaby. We both know it'd be weird if I went.
okay, maybe a little, but it'll be weirder if you don't.
excuse me?
look, everyone knows you're living with Edie.
if she shows up alone, people will think I asked her not to bring you, like it bugs me that you guys are together.
but it does bug you. You hit the roof when you found out.
which is why I have to show people that I'm okay with it.
please, just consider it my wedding gift.
okay, but I'm skipping the ceremony.
What?!
and just go to the reception? You can't do that.
I don't want to make a scene.
you'll vow, "till death do us part,"
I'll bust out laughing, people will stare...
reception starts at 4: 00.
I'm thinking a chocolate fountain would be a cool centerpiece to a dessert buffet.
dessert buffet?
we're having a wedding cake, right?
isn't that dessert?
Yeah, but you have to give people a choice.
don't you think a chocolate fountain would be elegant?
I don't know... you, a big white dress, melted chocolate.
am I the only one hearing alarm bells?
fine, we'll skip the chocolate.
how out a champagne fountain? Oh, I know!
maybe we can make the champagne flow through the ice sculpture.
don't you think we might be going a little over-the-top?
Mike, these are all fairly standard wedding features.
now you name one thing that you think is going over-the-top.
how about the dove wrangler?
well, the doves are not going to release themselves.
do we really need 40 of 'em?
okay, I know that you think I'being silly, but all of our friends went to Bree's wedding, and now they're going to Gaby'S.
two months from now, do we really want them thinking our wasn't as nice?
it seems to me our friends wouldn't be there to make petty comparisons.
they'd be there to celebrate our love.
you would think that, but no.
come on.
this is something that we have both looked forward to for so long.
don't you want it to be perfect?
Oh, I guess.
about the doves, though...
what?
you in a wedding gown, 40 birds circling overhead?
again, not liking those odds.
Oh, it's not as bad as it sounds.
it's, um, hodgkin's lymphoma, and apparent, if you're going to get lymphoma, that's the kind you want.
Hey, you wanna hold it down up there, kids?
I'm trying to talk to your aunt Lucy!
thank you!
anyway, I know I said that we would come and visit you this june, but I'll be a little woozy and...
bald from the chemo, so...
thanks for understanding.
Oh, one more thing
our insurance policy has a really high deductible, so we are strapped financially, and I was wondering if maybe you and Dave might be able to...
Oh, really?
no, I am not asking mom.
she doesn't know about any of this, so don't you tell her, okay?
we'll be fine. I love you.
Bye.
I take it that's a "no" on the loan?
Yep.
Dave lost his job at the plant, and he is now handing out flyers at a chicken restaurant, and
prepare to wince-- there is a chicken suit involved.
Ouch so where are we gonna find this $10, 000?
you leave that to me.
I want you to focus on getting better.
but, honey-- - I will find it.
meanwhile, we'll make some sacrifices around here.
my tennis club membership is up this month.
I'm not renewing.
should you even be playing tennis after your back surgery?
probably not.
well, in that spirit, as soon as I start chemo, I will be giving up shampoo.
okay, thanks.
taxi's here.
are you sure you're ready to go back?
we could wait another week.
and miss Gaby's wedding? No, I'll be fine.
is, uh, this the dress you were thinking for the ceremony?
Yes. - Oh, good.
I'll fold it in tissue so it doesn't wrinkle.
Oh, darling, I don't deserve you.
Oh, come on.
we agreed--no more tears.
I'm so sorry to be putting you through this.
I-I wouldn't blame you if you ran like hell and never looked back.
stop.
I'm going to raise this child and love it as if it were my own.
now let's see a smile.
well, I'm gladyou could join us, Milton.
it's good to get to know you before the wedding.
thank you. You know, I must say, all these months, I thought Victor was exaggerating about you.
but he hasn't done you justice.
you, my dear, are a flawless beauty.
I'm hardly flawless.
I'm sure I have a blemish hiddway somewhere.
now that's a search I would relish.
she is way out of your league, dad.
honey, he's a multimillionaire.
he runs my league.
by the way, Victor, I, uh, ran into Keith Perkinsonlast week.
and how is the venerable state chairman? - Impressed with you.
he liked the way you ranyour moral campaign, said if you keepyour numbers up, he might consider supporting you in the next governor's race.
Really?
what's so funny?
you gotta be kidding, right?
I mean, we just finished a campaign.
you're not about to put me through another one.
but I thought you loved campaigning.
God, no. It's a complete snore.
pasting a smile on my face while you say the same speech for the 50th time?
but you were a natural. People loved you.
well, the feeling wasn't mutual.
you think I enjoyed sipping tea with these frumpy matrons who wore loud, polyblend pantsuits?
you know how many timesI just wanted to scream, "vote for my husband, you color-blind cow!"?
I think you've discovered something very important about democracy, my dear
the nation is full of fools, and everyone gets a vote.
well, they're not gonna get us again.
I made nice with fairview.
I'm not about to suck up to the whole damn state.
what are you doing?
some guy out in mount pleasant's got a cracked water heater.
it's 3: 00 in the morning.
well, I started advertising as a 24-hour plumber.
after midnight, I get triple time.
okay, well, that's crazy.
you can't work round the clock. It's not healthy.
well, this is the third time I've worked this week.
I'm fine so far.
you've been sneaking out while I've been asleep?
what are you, ninja plumber?
it's just for a little while, earn some extra money.
is this about the wedding?
we agreed we want it to be nice.
but we didn't agree on this.
maybe I can scale things back a bit.
how?
have a ginger ale fountain?
make paper dovesand hope it's windy?
okay, seriously, you don't have to kill yourself.
I could max out my credit card.
is that really how you want to start our life together-- in debt?
no, I wanna start out happy.
but clearly, you're upset, and I don't know why.
I'm not Ian.
I can't afford to move you into a mansion or fly you off to paris, but I'll be damned if I don't give you the same dream wedding he would have given you.
I'll see you in the morning.
I'm drawing picturesof trees.
where the hell do you get off having cancer and not telling me about it?!
mom...
how do you think you could handle this without me?
Oh, there's my tommy boy!
come here!
Oh! God.
Oh, listen, be a love, will you, honey, and get my bags from the cab?
bags?
she's staying?
Yep.
and do not tip the driver.
s. O.B. Wouldn't let me smoke.
jeez, Lynette, I didn't know you opened a day care center.
Hey, kids, grandma's here.
okay, what did you tell them about me?
it's been five years, mom.
they don't remember you.
well, they'll remember me this time.
I brought presents.
cool!
hey...
for you, and...you, and you.
these are baby toys.
we're too old to play with these.
well, I'm too old to remember what the hell 6-year-olds like to play with.
we're 8.
what do I care?
just say thank you.
thank you.
Oh, wh-who's the pretty thing?
your girlfriend?
No!
she's my sister!
Oh.
is that tom's little b-a-s-t-a
okay, kids, time to get your toys and let's play upstairs.
come on, Penny.
come on, sweetie.
let's go, everybody.
listen, mom, I really appreciate you coming to help, but as you can see, I'm perfectly fine.
for now.
now how you gonna handle that mob when you're flat on your ass from chemo?
I'll manage.
you got through breast cancer while raising the three of us alone.
I was not alone.
I had you.
Lynette was all of 13, and she still looked after her sisters, cleaned the house, cooked the meals, and I was curled up in a ball, puking my guts out.
well, that's what you get when you mix chemo and vod kgimlets.
you can go ad me all you like, Lynette.
I did not come here to fight.
now trust me, cookie,
I have memorized the whole catalog of subjects you and I can no longer discuss, and if that means that we have to talk about the weather for three months, then fine.
but I am staying.
now...
if you'll excuse me, I have to go kick a child out of its room.
okay.
legs up!
Oh, you wanna do it again?
no.
I've been doinga lot of research, and gravity helps facilitate the sperm reaching the eggs.
so...
heave-ho!
Oh! Well, could we try a little light spooning before you hang me up like a side of beef?
Edie, we're trying to have a baby.
well, could we be a little less clinical?
maybe let nature take its course?
nature is not on our side anymore.
look, you're no spring chicken, and those eggs aren't exactly farm-fresh.
okay, stop referring to me as poultry.
sorry.
can we just try this? It's only for 30 minutes.
30 minutes?!
I am not staying in this position for a half an hour.
listen, I know that this requires some work, but it will all be worth it when we have our beautiful, beautiful baby.
right?
right.
I guess I could...make some sacrifices.
that's my girl.
can I get you anything?
Yeah. I'd kill for a beer.
sorry. No alcohol.
What?! For how long?
just until the baby's born.
Oh, and you stop nursing.
don't worry. I'll get you a nice herbal tea.
it's just for a few months while you're in treatment.
We're--we're gonna have to find someone to watch the kids.
No! I am not leaving that woman in charge of our children.
in three months, the twins will be chain-smoking, and Penny will be an alcoholic.
we can manage.
we've got Mccluskey.
she costs money--money that we won't have if we're paying someone to replace you at work.
you said not to worry about money, that you'd find it somewhere.
I did.
what, someone loaned us $10, 000?
no, gave us, and we can't thank her by kicking her out.
No! Tom, you didn't ask my mother?!
didn't have to.
she knew that you hit up lucy, so she offered.
well, we're giving it back.
no, we can't afford to.
Tom, you don't know half the stuff she did to us.
she would get drunk and smack us around.
she would meet some new guy and then drop us off at her sister's for a week because he wasn't into kids.
okay, so she was a crappy mom.
you said yourself that she has mellowed.
now she wants to make amends.
if you would just try to understand...
I think that I've been pretty understanding lately.
what's that supposed to mean?
I think you know.
great, so in the middle of everything I'm dealing with, you're gonna throw rick in my face.
when someone we love hurts us, if we still love them, we deal with it and we move on.
if I can do it, so can you.
so forgiving my mother...
that's my penance?
Yeah. I think it is.
I thought you said we weren't supposed to spend the night before the wedding together.
Yeah, I was trying to respect tradition...
but I got horny.
well, I guess we'll just have to start the honeymoon early, won't we?
let me get rid of this stuff.
what are you working on so late?
nothing.
polling data?
why are you polling? The election's over.
it's just a little research.
God, you look hot.
is this about running for governor?
because I told you how I feel about that.
my dad just set up a little...exploratory committee.
it's no big deal.
Oh. Okay, well, let's explore it now.
Nope, not gonna happen.
Gaby--Victor, ever since we met, it's been photo ops and fund-raisers, and I'm sick of it.
well, I'm a politician.
do you think I want my career to begin and end in the suburbs?
Fairview is my home, and I don't want to leave it.
and you can't make this decision without me.
I'm gonna be your wife.
exactly, not my career adviser.
Oh, so I don't even get a vote? - Not if it's a veto.
okay, look, no! I already married a man who put his career before me, and I sworeI wasn't gonna do it again.
well, I swore I would not let a stupid woman hold me back.
that did not come out the way I wanted it to.
I'm sorry.
I'm sor--I'm really sorry.
I've just been under a lot of pressure lately.
well, here's one less thing you have to worry about-- our wedding.
you can't cancel the wedding.
it's too late.
as far as I'm concerned, it's just in the nick of time.
good morning, Gaby.
God, Milton, the newspaper's not even here yet.
I'm sorry it's so early. I just...
came to apologize.
Why? What happened wasn't your fault.
that's not exactly the case.
is that coffee I smell?
you only bolted because Victor wants to be governor.
he only wants to be governor because of me.
you only suggested it.
you can't make him go after something he doesn't want.
the hell I can't.
ever since he was a kid, Victor's been killing himself trying to live up to his big shot father.
he's desperate for my approval.
Why?
I suppose because he's never gotten it.
everything he does--even becoming mayor-- I somehow let him know that it's not quite enough.
Oh...don't get me wrong.
I'm right to push.
that's why he's so successful.
so what are you saying, I should marry Victor because you're a withholding father?
no, I just want you to understand why he does what he does.
fine. I get it.
but why would I want a husband who values his father's opinion more than mine?
well, he doesn't really care much what I think anymore.
after you left last night, he called me and, uh...what's the phrase?
tore me a new one"?
he did?
he said because of me, he'd lost the best thing that had ever happened to him, and if he could't win you back, I could take my money and buy a new son, because I was never gonna be hearing from him again.
he blew off $80 million?
well, if he cares about me so damn much, why am I not hearing this from him?
I think you're about to.
is there a back way out of here?
aren't you gonna be late for Gaby's wedding?
Oh, weddings are boring.
I like to sneak in at the end, look teary-eyed and pretend I was there the whole time.
I am gonna see you at the reception.
Oh! Uh, hi, Danny.
Um...Carlos, the paperboy's here.
could you pay him?
come on in hey, here you go, Danny.
Oh. Uh, looks like I'm a little short.
can I catch you later?
no.
okay. Hold on.
Oh, my god.
what's that?
it's birth control pills.
I'm gonna need cash.
Hey, welcome home!
I have missed you, sweetheart!
Oh, here, allow me.
well, hello there, Julie.
you guys are back!
wow, somebody's...blonder.
Oh, yeah, my mom hates it, too.
so where's Danielle?
well, um, while we were in Switzerland, she ran across this boarding school, and she fell in love with it and just insisted that we let her spend a year abroad.
Wow. She must be having a really good time.
she hasn't returned any of my phone calls.
Oh, well, um, you know, her school's up in the mountains, and
and her cell phonereception is kind of funky.
she hasn't answered my e-mails, either.
well, I am gonna call her tonight and have a little talk with her about mmon courtesy, and I'm sure that you will get an e-mail first thing tomorrow morning.
well, we should go. I've got to get that brace let to Gaby before the wedding.
well, I'll see you guys there.
Bye.
well, that was uncomfortable.
you have no idea.
everyone's been asking questions.
this might not be as easy as we'd hoped.
there. Now you have something new.
so how do I look?
you are now officially the most beautiful bride that ever lived.
until your wedding, of course.
nice save.
it means so much to me that we're all here together right now.
And...break!
love you.
we are gathered here today to join together Victor Langand Gabrielle Marquez in matrimony
an honorable estate not to be entered in lightly, but reverently and soberly.
this is a lifetime union-- one based on love, honor and trust...
you wanna bemy new best friend?
premium scotch. Keep it coming.
you are promising not only to give of yourself, but also to accept each other, promising not only to love for today, but to extend that love to include...
I thought you weren't coming until after-- - save it...
okay, look, I can explain-- - don't bother!
your lies were more convincing when I cared.
Victor, do you take Gabrielle...
you've got to understand.
I do wanna have a baby with you, just not yet.
I...I just
I wanted to give you a chance to fall in love with me first.
I don't believe you, and I will never trust you again!
well, what was I supposed to do?
you backed me into a corner, and you were gonna bail on us, and I was just trying to save what we had.
Carlos, don't leave me...
please just talk to me.
I am done with you.
ladies a gentlemen, I present to you Mr. And Mrs. Victor Lang.
I'm sorry!
Mrs. Mccluskey! Enjoy the wedding?
nice. Very classy.
although what the hell was that brouhaha between Carlos and Edie?
I don't know and I don't care.
today, I'm so filled with love, I can forgive anyone anything.
Oh, um, but if you do see them again, call security.
so we're in zurich, and I sick after breakfast for the third morning in a row.
and I thought to myself, dear god, I hope I have not develop edan allergy to chocolate brioche.
life just wouldn't be worth living.
so I said, that's it. We're seeing a doctor.
well, you could've knocked us over th a feather when he said she was already two months pregnant.
Aw, I think it's so great, and we could not be happier for you.
when's your due date?
Oh, not until the early fall, but enough about me.
this is your day-- you and Vior-- who, by the way, I have not met yet.
Oh, my gosh, that's right.
okay, you stay here. I'm gonna go grab him.
it is so good to be back. I can't believe how much is happening.
I mean, you and Gaby getting married, and I'm having a baby.
what's going on with you, Lynette?
nothing. same old, same old.
Really? Is everything okay, sweetie?
cause you haven't quite seemed yourself the last couple weeks.
I'm fine. Everything's just fine.
I'll tell you this much--I'm exhausted.
I'll be glad when this day is over.
well, it was all worth it.
marrying Gaby is the smartest thing you've ever done.
with her bringing in the Latino vote, the governor's mansion's as good as yours.
well, that's assuming I can change her mind.
I had to make certain concessions just to get her down the aisle.
you're the husband now. The rules have changed.
be nice, buy her a few pretty things.
trust me, you'll be able to tame that little spitfire.
I'm not too worried. I've always been able to manage my assets.
did you find him?
no, I'm still looking, but I'll let you know.
Oh, movie's over.
and may I add...amen.
go out and play. Go on, go on. Out!
they're just gonna go play guns.
can I watch another movie?
Oh, Lynette said one was the limit, and she'll be home soon.
no, she won't.
whenever they go out to a party, they always come home at least an hour later than they say they will.
aren't you an observant little monkey?
tell me, sweetie...
would you know anything about a man named Rick?
Yeah, I know Rick.
my daddy and Lynette had a big fight about him.
Really?
sounds like there's maybe a little story there.
if I tell you, could I watch a really good grown-up movie?
if it's a really good grown-up story.
okay, I got you some appetizers to tide you over.
we have mini quiches and beef satay and something called "crystal coast shrimp with grits,
but it's mostly just grits 'cause I ate all the shrimpon my way over.
Reverend, that was such a beautiful ceremony.
really, just heartfelt and moving--the whole page.
why, thank you. - Yeah, it was really impressive.
so what are you doing tonight?
Oh, Carlos.
didn't know you were in here.
I got a little thirsty.
Yes. I can see that.
Gaby, I am sorry if I ruined your wedding.
but if it's any consolation, I also ruined my life.
what are you talking about?
a couple years ago, I was totally happy.
I had a home, you, a great career.
and I don't understandhow I let it all go to hell.
and now here I am, back at square one.
I really blew it.
Ah, what am I doing?
I shouldn't be dumping this on you.
it's your wedding day. Go to Victor.
I'm gonna stay right here
well, I don't know how you did it.
the kids are asleep, and the cough syrup hasn't been touched.
boy, you're just waiting for an excuse to give me the boot.
well, if history's any indicator, I won't have to wait long.
so you don't think people can change?
I think at a certain point, people just are who they are.
well, I think people can change.
now take you.
you were the perfect wife and mom...
then along came Rick.
how did you- - come on, Lynette.
you kids were young when I was sneaking around on Glen, but you knew something was up.
you heard about this from my kids?
just the girl, and all she knows is that daddy got mad because Rick "liked"you.
nothing happened between me and Rick.
Yes, he came on to me, but unlike you, I controlled myself.
well, you had Tom to come home to.
I had your stepfather.
Hey, Glen may have bored you, but the years we had a father in that house were the happiest in my life.
you didn't care about that, though, did you? You just drove him away.
and you couldn't wait to pay me back.
do you remember what you said the next year when I got sick?
no I don't. - Liar.
you said I earned it.
it was god's punishment.
how are you feeling now, Lynette?
you think you're being punished?
how can you say that?
you were sosanctimonious.
you could not imagine what sort of woman could do that kind of thing.
not so hard to imagine now, is it?
stop comparing us. I never did what you did.
no, you just wanted to.
you're leaving tomorrow.
I don't want your money. I don't want you imy house.
Hey. You are sick, Lynette.
you think you know what you're in for 'cause you watched me go through it?
watching it is nothing.
you are going to feel worse than you thought a person could feel, and I'll be holding your hand through every damn minute.
you can't stay if I don't want you here.
you can fight me or you can fight the cancer.
trust me, you won't have the strength to do both.
do young people still say "awesome"? - Not so much.
um, try "off the hook."
"off the hook"? That doesn't even make sense.
fine, ty in "groovy."See if I care.
Hello? Hodge residence.
Oh, hi, Danielle. Listen, I am sending Julie Mayeran e-mail from you.
now would you say that your school was "off the hook"?
uh, no. I would say it was sucky or crappy or a freaking nightmare.
look, if you're gonna start complaining, I'm going to hang up.
mom, you have gotto talk to the nuns.
they are so harsh with me, and they have all these stupid rules.
well, perhaps if some of those rules had been in place when you took up with Edie's nephew, you might not be in this little pickle.
mom, please, I just wanna come home.
look, I am gonna say this one last time.
you are gonna stay put until that baby is born.
now don't forget, we're driving up this weekend, and I am bringing your favorite-- lemon squares, and
Darling...can I draw you a bath?
that would be lovely.
Oh, would you give me a hand, please?
there you go.
it's almost time for the 6-month size.
Oh, don't remind me.
no. No, it's no problem. I can fix that for you.
just, um, give me yor name and address.
I'm Mrs. Emmeline Walcott, and I'm at 42 old mill road.
all right, I gotta stop and pick up a douglas valve, but, uh,
I should be there in 45 minutes tops.
I hate to see you drive when you're this tired.
there's some iced coffee in the fridge.
see you when I get back.
you were great. - did y'all ever doubt I would be?
just hurry up and get dressed. We only have 45 minutes.
are you mike? - Yeah.
I'm looking for a Mrs. Walcott's house.
you've come to the right place.
here, put this on.
you mind telling me what Susan's up to?
ask her yourself.
are you sure about this?
I don't want you to look back and regret not ving your perfect wedding.
well, I don't know if you've noticed, but my idea of the perfect wedding keeps changing.
one day, I want white roses, and then I want lilies, and first, I want a harpist, and then a string quartet.
only one thing stays constant...
and I'm looking at him.
why would I need anything else to make my wedding perfect?
well, who knew down sizing could be so romantic?
Yeah. - Uh, Mrs. Walcott, I presume?
that's right, sugar.
Oh, you might wanna check that breast pocket of your suit.
and just so you know, you'll be paying for those and the lights and the flowers.
I've never seen you look so beautiful.
you clean up pretty good yourself.
are we ready? - Are you kidding?
they've been dragging this thing out for three years.
we are gathered here today to join together Mike Delfino and Susan Mayer in matrimony
an honorable estate not to bentered into lightly, but reverently and soberly...
family-- there is nothing more important.
they're the ones who show up when we're in trouble...
the ones who push us to succeed...
the ones who help keep our secrets.
but what of those who have no family to rely on?
what happens to those poor souls...
who have no loved ones to help them in their hour of need?
well...
most learn to walk life's road by themselves.
but a sad few of us...
Simply...stop trying.
Susan and Mike finally tied the knot.
Lynette got some disturbing news.
where the hell do you get off having cancer and not telling me about it?
mom.
Bree returned from her trip.
holy crap!
with a surprise. - There you go.
Gaby married Victor.
Gaby is the smartest thing you've ever done.
with her bringing in the Latino vote, the governor's mansion's as good as yours.
while Carlos why are you so reluctant to make a commitment to me?
ended it with Edie.
I am done with you.
but the search for true happiness led to events that were unexpected and distinctly desperate.
the first thing you should know is that Edie Britt never actually intended to die, but someone she loved was trying to leave her.
so she planned every detail, from the silk scarf she'd hang by to the suicide note detailing her despair.
now all Edie had to do was wait for her beloved to come home.
Hey, Edie!
I'm here to get my stuff.
you see, to hold on to her man, Edie knew she'd have to find the perfect moment to let go.
Hey, Carlos!
sadly for Edie.
can I talk to you?
her timing was fatally flawed.
Mrs. Mccluskey?
I need to show you something.
come here.
what's this?
those are trash cans.
I know they're trash cans, smart-ass.
I'm asking what they're doing out on a Saturday night when the trash got picked up on Thursday.
fine.
I will take them in.
happy now?
what the hell is that?
and this is how Carlos Solis arrived just in the nick of time to save the life of Edie Britt.
Oh, baby.
what did you do?
come on, you gotta wake up.
come on, please?
of course, had he known what she was about to do to his life，he would've let her hang there.
there is a certain time of night, after children have been put to bed and husbands have begun snoring, that women lie awake and think of the secrets they've been keeping from their friends.
it might be an impromptu wedding.
or a recently diagnosed tumor.
or a make-believe pregnancy.
regardless, it's all they will think of until something comes along to remind them that other people have secrets, too.
how is she? What did the doctors say?
uh, they have got Edie on a ventilator, but she's gonna be okay.
what the hell happened? How could she pull a stunt like this?
uh, she left a note which pretty much blames me.
Oh, sweetie.
I can't believe this is happening.
it's like Mary Alice all over again.
Yes, but the good news is she's gonna live.
I know it's her wedding night, but do you think we should call Gaby?
Oh, crap.
you know, this is one hell of a wedding night, considering how long you're taking in there.
trust me, Victor.
this will be a night you'll never forget.
let's get out of here.
what?
I'm serious. You, me-- just screw it all.
Let's-let's run away together.
I just got married.
there are 200 people out there waiting for me to lead a conga line.
Gaby, you just said you don't feel like Victor really loves you, and you know I do. I've never stopped.
I can't dump him on our wedding day.
that's a horrible thing to do, even to Victor.
he'll get over it, but I've never gotten over losing you, and I won't let it happen again!
Gaby, you in here?
I was just counting gifts..
Oh, that's fine. I-I was actually looking for that publicist guy.
you haven't seen him, have you? - Nope.
okay.
I'll give you a holler when I need you.
come on!
who doesn't wear underwear on their wedding day?
Oh, focus, you idiot!
come on. When are we leaving?
so we're doing this?
great.
uh, it'll take me a few hours to get stuff together.
I'm gonna pick you up tonight. Just be packed and ready to go.
okay. Wait!
aren't you gonna kiss the bride?
Finally!
Carlos, where the hell are you?
I'm at the hospital.
Edie tried to kill herself tonight.
Oh, my God! Is she okay?
I found her just in time, but obviously, I can't come pick you up tonight.
okay, that's all right.
I'll just take a cab and meet you.
Gaby, I can't leave Edie now.
look, maybe in a couple weeks.
in a few weeks? What?
No! It has to be tonight!
Victor's in the bedroom right now waiting to consummate.
and Edie's on a ventilator.
look, you don't have to stay with Victor.
you have a house.
okay, you know, running away with you on my wedding night was crazy enough.
but running away to be alone is insane!
Gaby, please, she needs me.
can't you just wait?
No!
I would rather try and work it out with Victor.
Gaby, are you coming to bed?
one month later
happy 1-month anniversary.
I didn't know we were doing this.
well, we've just been so happy the last four weeks, I thought we should celebrate.
you are happy, right?
Yeah.
I've never been happier.
Aw, that's sweet.
I don't believe you.
Susan - I watch you sometimes, and you seem very disconnected, like something's missing.
nothing is missing.
so our life together is exactly how you pictured it?
you've gotten everything you wanted?
Yeah, pretty much.
"pretty much" means there is something that you want that you don't have.
how can I give it to you if you don't tell me what it is?
Susan, I swear, I am ecstatically, beyond my wildest dreams, lip-smackingly happy.
you got it?
this marriage is doomed.
Hey, a moving van just pulled up.
Oh, Andrew, I'm having problems with my strap.
could you help me?
look, I told you three weeks ago I was no longer participating in your little hoax, and that includes strapping you in.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Orson, could you come help me, please?
I'll remember this the next time you want money for leather pants.
people are gonna find out, all right?
and then we're gonna all look like idiots.
well, not if we're careful.
this isn't the '50s, okay?
teenage girls get pregnant all the time.
I mean, my ex-lab partner's practically a grandmother.
look, this family's reputation is already hanging by a thread.
I mean, first people thought that your stepfather was a wife killer, then your sister takes up with her history teacher, and now we're supposed to parade a little bastard up and down the street.
we might as well sit on the porch and play banjos.
Bree, you know, there's a moving van next door.
mom, are you awake?
okay, honey.
just give me a minute.
give me a minute.
my wig is gone.
where is it? - It's on the nightstand.
No! No, I'm looking at the nightstand, and all I see are a few stray hairs and this sports blooper do you thought would cheer me up.
Peyton Manning is funny.
mom!
Hey, I'm coming!
Hey, don't just sit there like a lump!
come on! Help me look!
Oh, God. Honey, this is one of those moments when it occurs to me that wouldn't it be easier if we just told everyone that you have cancer?
I found it.
look, I mean, I get not wanting to scare the kids, but to keep all of our friends in the dark.
look, I can deal with the chemo.
I can deal with people telling me my hair has never looked better.
but what I cannot deal with is the pity, so we are doing it my way.
you were crooked.
Hey, sweetie, what's up?
there's a moving van across the street.
so you want it listed right away?
and don't worry about getting top dollar.
I want this place priced to move.
what's going on here?
I'm meeting with our realtor.
Gaby, you remember Gil.
I remember telling you I wasn't ready to sell the house yet.
Gil, could you give us a minute, please?
Yeah.
Gaby, we agreed that after we got married, you would sell the house.
I still have a lot of stuff here.
well, my house is over 10,000 square feet.
I'm pretty sure there are closets.
I'm just not in a rush to unload this house, okay?
this was my home. I was very happy here.
but we've got a new home now.
aren't you happy there?
Yeah, it's a great house.
well, good.
then sell this place.
what are you waiting for?
I'm not waiting for anything.
look, a moving van.
new neighbors. What do we know?
well, uh, dining chairs. There's a clue.
Yes. It proves they eat sitting down.
no, I mean they're sticky.
it means they have taste.
and money.
they've been remodeling for weeks.
I wish Edie were here.
without her, there's no one to give us the dish.
yet another illustration of the fundamental selfishness of suicide.
do you think this is them?
Oh, my God. Katherine.
I cannot believe it has been 12 years.
you haven't changed a bit.
well, you clearly have. Your eyesight's going.
how's your aunt?
Katherine used to live here with Mrs. Sims.
not very well, I'm afraid.
that's really the reason why we moved back.
I didn't want poor aunt Lily to spend her final days in a nursing home.
that is so kind of you.
Yeah, it is.
Oh, and as luck would have it, my husband found a job here.
Adam, could you wave or something?
Hello, ladies.
I look forward to meeting you when I'm a little less sweaty.
he's a cutie.
what does he do?
he's a doctor.
okay, don't take this personally, but we hate you.
mom?
I finished unpacking my room.
do you need any help?
Oh, my God.
this is not little Dylan.
I'm Susan, Julie's mom.
she is gonna be so excited to see you.
great.
who's Julie again?
honey, you remember--your best friend when you were little.
Oh, right.
why don't you go help your stepfather with the last few boxes?
it's nice meet you all.
what a beautiful family.
I feel so lucky to have you for a neighbor.
no, I am the lucky one.
look at my view.
your garden is absolutely breathtaking.
and that pine tree in the backyard.
it's my pride and joy.
Oh, it absolutely kills me to have to ask you to cut it down.
excuse me?
well, I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna be able to grow my prize-winning vegetables with that tree blocking all the sunlight.
Oh, well, I'm--I'm sorry about your vegetables, but that pine shields my view of the Purcells' backyard, and if you had ever seen Mr. Purcell sunbathe, well, you'd know exactly what that tree means to me.
well, I don't want to quarrel.
we will not touch that tree until we have come up with a solution to our problem.
curtains, perhaps.
so you're back.
how fun.
I should have a brunch so that everyone can get to know you.
no, no need.
I'm having a barbecue this Saturday.
I'm inviting the whole neighborhood.
Oh, you don't need to do that.
I insist.
I have missed Wisteria Lane so much, and I wanna do something special for my dear, old friends.
and all you lovely newcomers.
the nice thing about this fake pregnancy is my feet don't swell.
I mean, I'd never be able to squeeze into these sling-backs if I really was 8-12 months pregnant.
don't you look radiant!
well, hello, Mrs. Mckeever.
well, I heard that you were expecting, but I had no idea how far along you were.
may I?
there's no need.
the baby's just not kicking right now.
sometimes, if you give them a little jiggle, you can get them to move.
Oh, she doesn't really wanna be jiggled right now.
she's very sensitive down there.
but I'll be gentle.
you know, in my day, mothers thought that it was good luck.
perhaps I need to make my point a little more clearly.
Bree, you're hurting me!
is there a problem here?
no, not at all!
I'm just saying hello to a very dear friend of mine.
are you gonna back off now?
car's here, dear.
lovely to see you, Mrs. Mckeever.
why must old ladies always do that?
I don't know, but you've got to stop roughing them up.
I'm sorry, Susan.
Dr. Gorenberg just had a patient go into labor.
his new partner is covering for him, if you're comfortable with that.
sure.
I'm just here for a checkup.
doctor?
thank you.
I'm Dr. Mayfair.
I'm gonna.
hold it. Have we met?
Yes. Yesterday.
Susan Mayer.
your new neighbor.
right.
I-I didn't know you were this kind of doctor.
I sure am.
listen, um.
maybe this isn't- - feet up, please.
okay.
and scotch down.
it's just that it's weird, you know, considering you're.
where' d you go?
and relax.
sorry.
and relax.
sorry.
and relax.
sorry.
um, hey, not to change the subject, but when is Dr. Gorenberg coming back?
almost done.
you know, Katherine has talked about you for years.
it's nice to finally put a face to the name.
Muriel. How are you doing?
what's up?
you look good.
don't try to sweet-talk me, Lynette Scavo.
I am fit to be tied.
did you or did you not volunteer to run the fund-raising gala?
Yeah.
things have been a little weird lately
don't even think of wriggling out of this, Lynette.
every other third grade mom has chaired an event.
it is your turn okay. I'll jump right on it.
great.
okay.
see, that's where someone with half a brain would have played the cancer card.
I can handle it.
like hell.
you've been nauseous all day from the chemo.
you shouldn't even be here!
it's my life.
some stupid disease is not gonna keep me from living it.
besides, Parker's expecting to see me.
there.
he saw you.
we'll duck out when the lights go down.
he's gonna be watching for me all day.
he's one of the leads.
he's Friar Tuck.
it's a thankless role.
well, everything seems normal.
but you say you've been having irregular periods.
Yeah.
you know, one month off, two months on.
that happens, right?
ever experience night sweats?
um, sometimes.
but Mike's a big spooner.
he's like sleeping with a hibachi.
um, how about hot flashes?
okay, whoa.
I'm gonna stop you right there.
I am way too young for that. Please refer to your chart.
Susan, I know for a lot of women the word "menopause" has negative connotations.
they hear, um,"aging," "brittle bones,"um,"loss of sexual desire."
okay, before we go any further, can I check those diplomas?
cause I would just like to make sure that they're not from some med school in the Philippines.
look, there's a simple blood test we can use to find out.
I don't need any test!
I am not old enough for menopause.
now I don't know what kind of nonsense they taught you at.
harvard medical school, class of.'97?
Oh, my God!
I am old!
just give me the damn test.
we will live in these woods till our work is done.
if the sheriff comes, we will drive him away with our bows and arrows.
you okay?
I'm feeling a little.
God save all you merry men!
I beseech thee!
pray that I may join your man-- band of merry men.
I am more than just a jolly friar, for I can have both a sword and an arrow!
we must support Robin Hood.
Oh, I'm gonna be sick!
right there with you, lady.
all hail Robin Hood!
okay, let's go.
No! It's too late!
Bravo!
I'm sorry.
I'll get you a new purse.
fine, but that wasn't my purse.
hello. You have everything you need?
you just let me know. Hi! Good to see you!
Oh, you look great!
Mrs. Mccluskey. Hello.
how are you? Do you remember me?
you're Bess Truman, right? Of course I remember you.
if that's your way of checking if my brain's gone all tapioca, I'm fine.
sorry.
so I saw your kid and your new husband. Nice catch.
Oh. Well, thank you.
I'm very eager for him to experience life on Wisteria Lane.
the times that Dylan and I spent here were the happiest of our lives.
yeah? Then why'd you take off so suddenly?
you skipped town without even saying good-bye.
my, you do remember a lot, don't you?
excuse me. Really must mingle.
I think these eggs are past their prime.
so you just shun them and throw them away.
well, yeah, since mayonnaise left out in the sun can kill you.
everything okay? You seem kinda moody today.
Yeah, get used to it.
okay, did I do something wrong? No. I'm sorry.
I'm just a little.
you know what? Forget it.
let's eat.
Yoo-hoo, Susan! We saved you a place!
come on! We want you over here. Come on.
Oh, my God! Dylan!
Hi.
it's me. Julie.
Julie's the one we were talking about.
Hi, honey! - Hi!
she was your best friend.
Yeah, and I-I brought you a little welcome back gift. Your favorite.
Oh, my goodness.
you remember how much you used to love licorice?
I did?
okay.
come on. I've got some of the old gang I want you to meet.
have fun!
menopause?
aren't you a little young for that?
I know.
and you thought you married a vibrant woman in her prime, and instead, you got a wife who's dry and dusty.
Oh, honey.
no, it's--it's a natural part of life.
Yeah, the part before death. Oh!
look, I know that it's upsetting, but it's really not that big a deal.
Yes, it is! What if you wanna have kids?
we agreed that we didn't.
no, you said you did.
I said I didn't, then you changed your mind.
what if you change it back?
that's not gonna happen.
listen, my last egg could be on its way down the chute at this very moment.
if you wanna have kids, you might wanna jump on it right now.
all right this is all very romantic, but let me be clear about this, okay?
I love you, and if kids don't happen, I'm fine with that.
I don't want you to be fine.
I want you to be happy.
all right, I'm just trying to find a nice way to shut you up, so.
Yep, we're doomed.
Hey. Hey, look who's back.
Oh, my gosh. She's out of the clinic.
Thanks, darling.
Hi! - Hi!
how are you?
Oh, careful--the neck. - Oh, sorry.
thank you all so much for the cards.
sometimes it takes a near tragedy to realize just how much you're loved.
so why don't you talk to your friends, and I'll go unpack the car?
Oh, thanks, sweetheart.
I have to admit that I was a little concerned about how you'd react when you saw me.
but this throwing me a party?
well. we just all love you.
and, Edie, you look great. Especially you know, given the circumstances.
you mean that I tried to hang myself.
it's okay.
the doctor encouraged me to talk about it.
surely not over food.
well, Carlos and I talk about it all the time.
you know, and this whole thing has just brought us closer together.
we've actually talked about marriage.
hello. I don't think we've met.
I'm Katherine Mayfair, your new neighbor.
Oh, Edie. It's a pleasure to meet you.
welcome to my party.
so I hear congratulations are in order.
Edie just announced you're getting married.
best wishes!
we're not engaged.
that was just a kind of a what if conversation.
Really? Because she thinks you're getting married.
everyone else thinks you're getting married.
so, again, best wishes.
Gaby, the woman tried to kill herself because I left her.
she's not real good with disappointment.
neither am I!
you told me you wanna run away together, and then I don't hear from you for a month!
that was only because I was going through stuff with Edie, but it doesn't mean that I wasn't thinking about you constantly.
you were not.
Yes, I was.
every second of every day.
Yeah, well, I kind of thought about you, too.
I need to be with you, Gaby. - Yeah?
prove it.
can you get away tonight?
Oh, my God, are you serious?
damn right I am.
I just have to be back by midnight to give Edie her pills.
what?
if we're gonna have an affair, we've gotta be discreet.
affair?
I thought we were talking about running away together.
I can't do that.
Edie's too fragile right now.
that old battle-ax is gonna outlive us all!
Hey, don't talk about her like that.
Oh, far be it for me to speak ill of the future Mrs. Carlos Solis.
we are not getting married!
best wishes!
no. Absolutely not.
that's my final answer.
well, talk to you later.
that was Danielle.
now she wants us to send a DVD player for her room.
well, that hardly seems extravagant.
you're missing the point! It's a convent, not the four seasons.
you have mustard on your chin.
I mean, it's one thing to forgive bad behavior. It's another thing to reward it.
there are consequences for her mistakes.
Bree! Oh, my God!
are you all right?
Oh! No, no, I'm fine! I'm fine!
you're bleeding! - No, no, no!
it's just, uh--oh, it's a little barbecue sauce.
where is Katherine's husband?
he's a doctor. - She's fine.
get over here right now!
Bree got stabbed in the belly!
Oh, my God, are you all right? Let me take a look.
no, it's nothing!
Ah, uh, we were just teasing Ida.
it's something we do. - Yes.
look, it's a trick ba--barbecue fork.
we got it at a magic shop.
uh, see? Retractable!
Oh, my baby!
that's quite a trick.
Hey, let's go freak out Mrs. Mccluskey.
he's such a scamp.
psycho mom at 5: 00.
you say the word, she gets a face full of pig bones.
Aw, my hero.
I can handle her.
I just spoke with Helen, and imagine my surprise when she told me that you'd not started on the decorations for the gala.
I'm in charge of decorations?
Yes, which you would've known had you bothered to pick up the packet.
I don't want to hear it.
okay.
piggyback, mommy.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I'm just-- I'm just too tired right now.
here, honey, I'll get you.
Yes!
mommy has to conserve her energy for more important things.
we are not throwing in the towel over a minor mishap.
how many more mishaps are we gonna get away with?
yesterday, it was an old woman in the Macy's shoe department.
today, a magic fork in the belly.
pretty soon, this whole charade will completely unravel, and we will be humiliated.
we're already in too deep.
we could go on a trip, tell people you miscarried while we were away.
and then what would happen to the baby?
well, Danielle would keep it.
you think Danielle could raise this child?
Orson, you've seen her in action.
she's--she's shallow, and she's--she's selfish!
she would ruin this child's life!
how can you say that?
because I'm her mother.
and I know what I've created, and that's the real humiliation.
this child deserves better.
and I know what to do now. Please.
please let me try.
so really, what you want is a second chance?
well, would that be so horrible?
well, then let the charade continue.
so you're bailing on me now? - I know.
the timing is terrible. - Damn right!
it's three weeks before the gala.
I just didn't realize how tired I would be when I took this on.
Oh, we're all tired, Lynette.
but some of us still manage to honor our commitments.
okay, I'm gonna be honest with you.
I haven't been feeling that great lately. - Oh, don't whine to me about your aches and pains.
I've had the same migraine since '87.
and my knee's so bad, I can't even use the treadmill anymore.
Yeah.
that's rough.
by the way, I have cancer.
I'll give Helen a call.
so I am halfway through chemo, and my doctor is very confident that I'm going to beat this, so you can all relax.
I'm not going to die.
well, not unless we kill you.
damn it, Lynette. What did we say after Mary Alice.
after Edie? Why didn't they tell us?
we're your friends. Why would you shut us out?
I just liked being able to throw on my wig and join you guys for a cup of coffee and a good gossip about the new neighbors.
you know, for five minutes, I could pretend I wasn't a sick person.
but once your friends know you're sick, you can't pretend anymore 'cause you can see it in their eyes the fear, the pity.
is that all you see in our eyes?
no. No, of course not.
you know what? Let's make a pact.
no more secrets.
from now on, we tell each other every shocking detail of our lives.
I'm in. - Me, too.
you with us?
Absolutely.
no more secrets.
you're right. I'm not happy. Let's talk.
all I'm saying is I just wanna know that I come first with you.
sometimes I feel less like your wife than a possession.
it's demeaning. It's--it's.
why are you smiling right now?
because this is fantastic.
after weeks of shutting me out, you're finally telling me how you feel.
we should do this all the time.
well, it's hard when you're so busy.
maybe we should go away and just take a couple weeks or a month.
let's rediscover what it was that made us fall in love to begin with.
that is a great idea. Let's do it.
how's next week?
let's see here.
well, I've got the meeting with the school board on Tuesday.
and the end of the month, I've got that conference in Washington--oh, shoot.
I've got the groundbreaking for the new civic center.
dad's birthday.
economic development forum.
how about April?
I can give you two whole weeks in April.
I'll see you later, babe.
where you going?
to Scavo's for a few beers.
can I come?
no. - Why not?
Edie, I know you've been through a lot lately, but I can't hold your hand 24 hours a day.
if you want this relationship to work, you gotta give me some downtime.
okay, so I managed to get away from Edie.
what do you want?
to get you away from Edie.
Oh, come on. You have to remember your boyfriend Joey Miller.
you used to chase him around the jungle gym.
Really?
you'd think I would've gone for this guy with the sexy finger up his nose.
so you don't remember any of the kids we used to play with?
no.
to be honest, I don't remember anything about living here.
Really?
so. what is your earliest memory?
I don't know if this is a memory, but for years, I've had this creepy dream.
I'm really little, and there's a guy in my room, and he tries to grab me.
that is creepy.
have--have you ever talked to somebody about it?
you mean like a therapist?
my old babysitter suggested that, but my mom got mad and said no.
Really? - Yeah.
then she fired the babysitter.
Susan? - I'm in here.
uh, your front door was open.
no problem.
um, what's up?
first, let me just say this is one of the more embarrassing moments of my career, and you have every right to hate me.
Adam, I have no idea what you're talking about.
well, your test results came back, and your estrogen levels are fine.
you're not about to start menopause.
Really? That's fantastic!
there's more. - More?
you're pregnant.
what? Wh-what did he just say?
I'm pregnant?
he said I'm pregnant.
I have never been happier.
well, now I believe you.
there you are.
I'm sorry.
I got in late last night. I didn't want to wake you.
you don't have to explain.
I trust you.
well, good. You should.
I just wish you trusted me a bit more.
what are you talking about?
why didn't you ever tell me about your offshore bank account?
what?
well, you know, the one in the Cayman Islands with $10 million in it.
I miss you when you're gone.
going through your things makes me feel like you're with me.
okay, um, I know how this looks.
what did you think I was gonna do?
tell people?
turn you in? Try to get my little hands on it?
I don't care about money, Carlos.
all I care about is you.
that's why this relationship is going to work.
you can trust me with your secrets, just like I can trust you not to hurt me.
there is a certain time of morning.
it occurs after kids have left for school and husbands have headed off for work.
it's a time when women think of the secrets they've been keeping from their friends and how shocked they would be if the truth was discovered.
and how they'll do everything in their power to keep that from happening.
but what of those lucky women who have no secrets left to keep?
what do they think about every morning?
Hey!
is something wrong?
it's just Dylan and I used to be best friends.
I mean, we did everything together.
I know. She was like a sister to you.
well.
that girl that I've been hanging out with.
and I know this is gonna sound crazy, but that's not the same girl.
these women spend their mornings thinking of their neighbors and the secrets. They may be keeping.
there you are. I've been calling you.
is this the room? - Yes.
Dylan's been asking me if she can move in here.
so let her.
you may remember what happened here, but she can't.
doesn't matter.
I won't allow it - hey, you okay?
did we make a mistake coming back here?
did we have a choice?
Gaby, I'm getting married.
and I was married when we got together.
that is not how I'm gonna be married.
Lynette got the support she needed for chemotherapy.
Katherine, who liked everything in its place...
Yeah, I've seen a lot of cable, so I get it.
I hope we can live up to your stereotype.
I should go.
the odd-Looking boxes were delivered to the home of Bob Hunter and Lee Mcdermott early on a Tuesday morning.
it wasn't long before workmen had opened them and begun assembling the various parts and pieces.
happily, it only took three hours to turn the contents into a finished work of art.
sadly, it only took 15 minutes for e residents of Wisteria Lane...
what the hell is it?
to become art critics.
I think it's a sculpture.
I think it's crap.
of a the gay men in the world, we have to get the two without taste.
what are we gonna do about this?
I say we keep smiling and look for the hidden cameras.
I think we're about to get punk' d.
I don't think there's anything we can do.
it's not our lawn.
it's our neighborhood,
and we have rules against this sort of thing,
or at least we did when I used to live here.
who's running the homeowners association?
well, it was Mary Alice, but as you may have heard...
and a husband who's been looking for the doorknob.
what? You've met him.
Ooh! They're coming.
good morning, ladies. - Hi.
uh, we were just talking about your sculpture.
that's what I love about art-- The way it provokes discussion.
although it would've been nice if you had discussed it with us.
what, you don't-- You don't like it?
well, we're not saying that.
it's just a little, uh...It's an eyesore.
Really?
you hear that, Bob?
we flew to Finland and paid $24,000 to commission an eyesore.
I don't mind it.
not to brag, but I went to art school.
community college.
and they taught us that art is subjective.
thank you, Susan.
Susan's need for approval aside, this clearly is not appropriate for the street.
Wisteria Lane has a traditional look.
well, maybe you'd like it better if we covered it with a gingham throw.
ladies, uh, I'm sorry.
we honestly thought that people would like it, but even if you disapprove, we hope that you will respect our right to decorate as we see fit.
have a nice day, Philistines.
Yes, art came to Wisteria Lane on a Tuesday morning, and by Tuesday afternoon...I think it's time to reconvene the homeowners' association.
all in favor?
Aye.
war had come as well.
as word of the sculpture spread, Bob and Lee began to wonder if any of their neighbors would be supportive.
but when the sculpture's true function was unveiled the next day, whatever support they did have...was quickly washed away.
come on.
it's 6: 00 a.m.
what is that?
I don't know, but make it stop.
Oh, my God.
it's a fountain, too.
we would have mentioned that yesterday, but your friends were a little uptight.
Yeah, they can get like that.
so do you think that you can just turn it off for a second?
what's up?
I was just wondering, um, do you think you could move it to your backyard?
Why? I thought you liked it.
remember? You said,"art is subjective."
Yes.
quiet art is subjective,
but you see, Mike is working really long hours lately, and he can't sleep with all that noise.
we're not gonna turn it off
because we need it to drown out all the stuff we hear coming from your house.
like what?
let's see. You yakking to your mom on the phone.
you grunting through your Pilates DVDs.
you in the shower, butchering the score to Brigadoon.
I have a lovely voice.
whoever told you that is not your friend.
he's a little cranky.
I think someone needs his French toast.
come on, Lee.
no, no, no, no. No, no, we're not done here.
as your neighbor, i have a right to be heard...
and I say that simple human decency dictates that you turn off that fountain right now!
Hey, guys.
do over, Parker.
Hey, guys, I got your snack.
what you playing?
action figures.
wanna play, mom?
she does awesome alien voices.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Hello?
Oh, yeah. Hi, Dr. Iller.
okay, that's my white blood count.
Uh-huh, but as long as it's higher than 4.0, That means I don't have neutropenia, right?
well, that's great.
thanks for calling.
Yeah, you, too.
Bye.
what?
you can't talk about doctors up here.
or about being sick.
if you do, you have to go.
that's the rule.
well... that's a good rule.
although it wasn't bad news.
it was actually-- - Doesn't matter.
we voted.
it's a rule.
got it.
sick talk done, okay?
you guys have fun.
freeze power.
do over, Parker.
that guy doesn't have freezing power.
if his guy can fly, my guy can freeze.
Hi. It's, uh Mrs. Hodge.
may I please speak with Danielle?
muffins.
hands off.
we're bringing these to Dielle for her birthday.
what do you mean, she's gone?
and you believed her?
you idiot!
I should sue your irresponsible yeah, Well, good day to you, too, reverend mother!
what happened?
those stupid nuns at the convent let Danielle's grandmother kidnap her.
she claimed I'd given her permission for a weekend visit.
it's me.
you can screen your calls all you want to, but trust me, old woman, you are in a world of trouble.
I know where you live, and I am coming for you.
shouldn't we be worried?
no, I think we're ready for her.
now show me again how you kill the zombies.
why can't I go?
I play golf.
and I'd love to meet you...College buddies.
Edie, me and the guys have only two rules for these weekends?
no women
fine.
be that way.
and to think, I got you a gift.
Hey, golf balls.
they're monogrammed.
wait. These are your initials.
exactly.
while you're out there playing, want everyone to know who your balls belong to.
good work, boys, but I have to head out in a few minutes, so make sure you put all the stuff back in the garage.
Hello?
Hey, on my way.
meet you at the hotel, okay?
I'm leaving in five minutes.
uh, Brett, could you come here a second?
how long has that van been parked over there?
couple hours.
hours?
are you serious?
Oh, my God.
I think he's just waiting for someone to come home.
Brett, when's the last time a cable guy waited for anyone?
I see a lot of lawn mowing in your future.
Hey, it's me again.
you're not gonna believe this.
before Victor left on his business trip, he hired someone to tail me.
Oh, man. Should we call this off?
no way.
it's gonna take more than a guy with mini binoculars and a bag of doughnuts to keep me under lock d key.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
boys, time to get paid.
come on, Eddie!
come back here!
are you taking the bus home?
as soon as we get around the corner, we're gonna have to adjust this horn.
Gabrielle. Hey.
h-hi.
look at you.
what a surprise.
Oh, uh, this is Gaby.
this is my wife Tammy.
Tammy, this is Gabrielle.
wow, look at you.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
it wasn't planned.
okay.
so... are you guys staying here?
no, we just came for some lunch.
daddy owns this place.
that's right.
you're a hotel heiress.
Yeah, but not one of the skanky ones.
how do you two know each other?
I used to be Gabrielle's gardener.
Oh! Well, as you can see, he's certainly married up from lawn boy.
Tammy. - What?
forget it.
so I heard you married the mayor.
you're married to Victor Lang?
he and daddy go hunting together.
I told John if he would just be nicer to daddy, he could hang out with people like the mayor and make important contacts.
and I keep telling you that I don't need to kiss your father's ass to have a career.
uh, yeah, so I married the mayor.
kooky, huh?
so, um, is he here with you?
uh, no.
he's away at a conference, so I decided to treat myself to a spa weekend.
you should definitely get the full body massage.
Oh, I plan to.
good to see you.
you, too, Gaby.
sorry about that.
a complete shock. I mean, of all people to run into.
who were they?
just an old friend and his idiot wife.
come on. Let's go.
Bree, how lovely to see you.
cram it, Phyllis.
you got a lot of nerve stealing Danielle from a convent we prepaid for.
she didn't steal me.
I'm a mature person capable of making my own decisions.
well, good. You can decide to pack, because we are taking you back to the convent.
I'm turning 18 this weekend, so you can't boss me around anymore.
I'm staying with grandma,
and I'm gonna have my baby delivered here.
we have an excellent medical staff.
it's a retirement village.
all these doctors know how to deliver is bad news.
I don't care.
I'm staying, and I'm gonna raise the baby here, too.
what?
entirely her idea.
a baby is god's most precious gift.
I will not have mine raised by a cold, emotionally unavailable woman like you.
emotionally unavailable.
gosh, I wonder where she picked up that little phrase.
like I'm too dumb to think of it myself?
you're always mean to me, just like you were to dad.
you emasculated him.
well, you're not gonna emasculate me.
you don't even know what that means, you petulant sock puppet!
who cares?
I'm going to the store.
buy a dictionary.
so that's all settled.
would you like some iced tea?
you aren't joining the lunch mob?
uh, you mean Katherine's homeowners thing?
Yeah, I think I'll sit this one out.
no, no, no. You can't do that.
you've got to pick a side.
art or mindless conformity?
see, this is one of the upsides of having cancer.
you get to excuse yourself from petty neighborhood squabbles.
you won't think they're so petty when she comes after you.
me?
why would she do that?
did the homeowners' association approve everything in your yard?
the fence?
that swing?
the tree house?
I don't think Katherine will bother herself over a tree house.
first, they came for the fountains, and I did not speak out because I had no fountain.
what?
then they came for the lawn gnomes, And I did not speak out because I had no gnome.
you're comparing Katherine to a Nazi?
then they came for my tree house,
and there was no one left to speak out for me.
thank you, ladies.
I so appreciate your input, and I think we can all agree that the fountain has no place on our street.
Yeah, we gotta show those gays we mean business.
Ida, again, the issue is not Bob and Lee being gay.
it's t fountain.
well, can't it be both?
anyway...
if you elect me president, my first act will be to eliminate the so-called work of art.
hear, hear.
Yes, Lynette.
after you get rid of this fountain, that's it, right?
I don't follow.
I mean...You're not gonna start checking everyone's yards for things that don't fit in?
Oh, of course not.
as long as those things meet the association's guideline.
and what if they don't?
are you referring to something in particular?
my kids' tree house.
can you promise you'll leave it alone?
well, it's not up to me.
that's the whole point.
there are rule that sounds like a no.
if I make an exception for you, then I have to make one for everyone,
and surely, you realize that the whole neighborhood can't revolve around your little tree house.
now since I am running unopposed, I just need someone to second my nomination.
Oh! Thank you, Lynette no, actually, I'm nominating myself.
I am now running for president...
against you.
you know, running for president in your condition?
I don't think it's a good idea.
Tom, I don't want your opinion, just your vote.
if you want to save the tree house, why don't you let me run instead?
because you'd never win.
bossy women rule this street. You know that.
I know one rules my life.
I'm sorry. I didn't catch that.
nothing.
look, this is not just about a tree house or a fountain.
this is about what kind of neighborhood we want to live in.
do we get to make our own choices, or do we let the taste police make them for us?
Ah, now I get it.
this about you wanting to take on Katherine.
No!
this is about personal freedom?
honey, if you're looking for something to fight, how about your cancer?
Hey, a tumor is a tumor whether it's in your body or living across the street.
I don't know why you buy those things.
they just end up on the floor.
because I want to feel pretty and feminine.
my chili cheese fries!
just a second!
it's me--John.
John who?
uh, okay.
you know that old friend I ran into in the lobby?
it might have been John Rowland.
maybe.
I'm not sure.
but just to be safe, you may wanna hide in the closet.
what? I'm not hiding from that guy.
Really?
because his father-In-Law goes hunting with Victor?
John, what are you doing here?
when I ran into you last fall, you wanted to start up our affair again, and I wasn't ready.
well, I'm ready.
Hey.
listen, I promised Tom I wouldn't knock myself out campaigning for this homeowners thing, so I was hoping you could help me?
I would love to, but...
but what?
this is awkward.
uh, I told Katherine I'd vote for her.
you're picking her over me?
uh, it's not like I'm pro-Katherine.
I'm just anti - fountain.
Oh, don't give me that look.
I made her a promise.
okay.
if I vote for you, do you promise to get rid of that fountain?
see, that's awkward for me.
this is about personal freedom. You know?
I'm running as a libertarian.
well, I'm voting as a light sleeper.
it's right outside our bedroom window.
seriously, Lynette, it's like living next to splash mountain.
but it's my kids' tree house.
they really need it.
well, we need our sleep.
why don't you get earplugs?
why don't you get...tree house plugs?
what?
that doesn't even make sense.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
you know, tired people aren't witty.
seriously, John, you have got to get out of here.
no.
please.
I need to be with you.
what about your wife?
you met her.
she's dumb, demanding, totally self-centered, especially in bed.
I mean, she's awful.
awfully pregnant.
I know.
I-I'm completely trapped, just like you were with Mr. Solis.
what...
I-I wasn't trapped.
what do you mean?
all you'd ever talk about was what a selfish pig he was.
well, I think you're paraphrasing.
okay, seriously, you have to go.
come on.
you know it could be hot, just like old times.
remember how great our sex was?
Oh, I don't think we need to get into that.
what about the time we were doing it in the shower?
Mr. Solis drove up?
uh, does not ring a bell.
come on.
and I hid the closet?
and you looked so hot, Mr. Solis pulled you down on the bed.
and you had to fake an orgasm just so he wouldn't catch on.
Yeah, good times.
anyways, uh, that's a negatory on the affair... - What?
and I will see you later.
come on, but we're so good together.
Gaby-- Please!
boy, that was a close one, huh?
you faked it with me while that wax job was hiding in the closet?
Yes, I had an affair.
old news. Move on.
Where's that room service?
so you're not gonna apologize for humiliating me in my own bed?
you deserved it.
all you cared about back then was work.
Hey, I was not that bad of a husband, and somebody had to support your Italian shoe addition.
I shopped because I was bored and lonely?
Yeah, with our teenage gardener!
I should have snapped that kid's neck two years ago.
Oh, let it go!
John Rowland didn't do anything to you that you're not doing to Victor.
you can't even compare the two!
it's completely different!
is it, Mr. Man in the closet?
Yeah, you heard me.
who's John Rowland now?
Katherine, what are you up to?
just visiting a friend.
liar.
you're campaigning.
Cookies--Nice touch.
Ditto on the scarf.
Edie, you got a moment?
I am running for president of the homeowners' association,
and I want to talk to you about that horrible fountain.
screw the fountain.
you want my support?
make Ida Greenberg ditch that screen door.
looks fine to me. It's hardly ripped at all.
in fact, if you give me your support...I'll make Mrs. Burkette prune those roses.
it's a garden, not a jungle, and you shouldn't have to...pay for a fence you don't even want.
that's not how you make good neighbors, and I don't care if...The Mustafas don't celebrate Christmas.
you're asking them to hang a few lights, not convert.
when I'm president, I promise...you can keep that satellite dish.
in fact, this is practically a first amendment issue.
the way I see it...the entire neighborhood should be a testament to symmetry and beauty.
So...Have I got your vote?
um, I'm not sure yet.
keep rubbing.
Bree, I know you're upset, but you've got to eat.
I'm just so mad at myself.
I should have realized is so strong, that even Danielle would develop it.
what's so funny?
you know those animals who eat their young?
even they have more maternal instinct than Danielle.
then why would she want the child?
you've known her how long, And you still haven't figured out how that lentil she calls a brain works?
there's no need to insult your sister. - Let him talk.
all right, Danielle cares about three things
Danielle, fun, and, uh...
wait. I was wrong. It's just two.
and a retirement village is fun?
compared to what you're offering her?
a crappy job and county college.
I mean, you think grandma's gonna make her do any of that?
so Danielle's only doing this because Phyllis is offering her a cushy life?
Yeah.
if you want that baby, you're gonna have to outbid grandma.
what are you doing here?
Hi, John.
I wanted to talk to you.
it'll be very friendly. No hitting.
what's up?
this is gonna sound weird, But, uh, I've been doing some thinking lately,
and, well, I've decided that it's time for me to forgive you.
for sleeping with my wife.
Yeah, well, I didn't just sleep with Gaby.
I fell in love with her.
I forgive you for that, too.
why are you doing this?
you in some kind of 12-Step program?
let's just say I've recently learned
how loving someone makes you forget the difference between right and wrong.
anyway, that's pretty much it. I should go.
Hey.
do you still talk to Gabrielle?
occasionally. Why?
I just want to know if she was happy.
I think she is.
well...
good for her.
all right, before we vote, are there any more questions for the candidates?
anybody besides Lee? - It's not a question.
I just want to remind everyone that a vote for Katherine is a vote for fascism.
what is it with you gay people and clothes?
fascism, Ida, not fashion.
although if you ever do want to talk fashion, we're here for you.
all right, debate's over.
all in for Lynette okay, and those for Kathrine?
that's 14 for Lynette and 14 for Katherine.
so what do we do? It's a tie.
Ah!
no, it's not. Susan voted twice.
did I?
well, that's obviously wrong.
you only get one vote, sweet cheeks. Who's it gonna be?
Susan, we're waiting.
it's up to you, honey.
Katherine. - Oh!
okay, it's official. Katherine is our new president.
thank you.
thank you, everyone, and I promise to do my best for this neighborhood.
and, Bob, Lee, Mr.Mustafa, I'll be in touch regarding your various infractions.
Oh. And you, too, Lynette.
meeting adjourned.
Oh.
I'm sorry you know, Phyllis, we cannot thank you enough for accepting our apology.
well, I think we should try to stay on good terms for Danielle's sake.
I'm glad you suggested that we eat out here.
I never think to do this.
Oh, damn, I forgot the napkins. - Oh, no problem.
I'll go get some.
so now that we have a moment alone,
your mother and I would like to say how proud we are of you.
Yeah, right.
seriously, we hadn't realized you'd matured enough well yourself grandma's gonna help.
she'll do what she can, but you mustn't overtax her.
her heart is not very strong.
she seems nice to me.
well, knock wood.
we'd hate to see you forced to take care of a baby and a sick old woman.
Whoa! Mah-Jongg.
don't see that much anymore.
Hey, hey.
Danielle, you should introduce yourself.
these people are your new friends.
and you're going to learn more from their experience and wisdom
than you ever could have learned at that college in Florida.
wait. I thought I couldn't go there.
you said it was just a party school.
well, actually, we checked into the curriculum, and it's very strong, but no matter. You'd be happier here.
Yes, and with a grandmother's unconditional love, Who needs frat boys who only like you for your convertible?
whoa. When did I get a convertible?
well, we were gonna surprise you with one for your birthday,
but since you're keeping the baby, You'll want a more practical gift.
we're thinking a diaper service.
Oh, look, they have water aerobics.
up!
out.
you should sign up.
you know, maybe I should go to college.
I mean, for the boy's sake.
how can support it without a degree?
but you can't raise this child in a Miami dorm room.
you'll need to leave it with someone you can trust to take care of it properly.
sorry. The elevator's outi...
I have to catch my breath.
grandma?
we need to talk.
what's this? - I thought we might toast my victory.
I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
Oh.
So...you haven't congratulated me yet.
I know.
would you like to tell me what's bothering you?
I just want you to think about what you've been doing for the past few days.
you've mounted a crusade against a metal thing that shoots out water.
I'm trying to keep the neighborhood beautiful. I love this street.
Yeah, you keep saying that
how happy you used to be here,
but ever since we've moved back, All I've seen is an unhappy woman who needs to control everything.
when you lose control.
should again
tell you something else we learned there.
when the chips are down, it helps to have friends.
and you certainly haven't made us any lately.
Congratulations.
Bye, grandma. - Good-Bye, dear.
tell your stepfather I'll be right out.
Oh please, Phyllis.
even you have to agree that a girl who'd trade her baby for a convertible isn't ready for motherhood.
she'd have changed once the baby came.
she's her father's daughter.
that's a nice picture of Rex.
Oh, I have a lot of pictures.
all of the women here do.
they're what we have left of the things time has taken from us...
youth, homes and husbands...And for the unluckiest, children.
I thought I was getting back a part of Rex.
but now...
I know you're lonely, Phyllis, But I can't give up this child just to make you feel better.
you should go.
your family's waiting for you.
Orson and I go to our club almost every Saturday night, if you're...Interested in babysitting.
you mean it?
how will you explain me to your friends?
I'll say that you're broke and needed the money.
can't you just say that you like having me around?
I need something that will fly, Phyllis.
Hey. What's going on?
we need to talk.
so here's the deal.
I think it's time for us to do the right thing.
I don't think I like where this is going.
we have to end this affair - you serious? - All this...Sneaking around, wearing disguises, hiding in closets?
it's just wrong.
we're better than this.
so what are you suggesting, we stay with Victor and Edie?
no, we break up with them.
look, it'll hurt, but at least it's honest.
and then when enough time has gone by and they've moved on,
we can be together.
how long are we talking about?
I don't know. Six months?
six months?
nobody takes that long to heal anymore.
it's a breakup, not a face-lift.
Hey, look, I want us to be together, too, but I also wanna myself good about it.
don't you?
Yeah.
I do.
you're such a good guy, Carlos.
I really hate that about you.
I know.
so...I guess this is it.
this kiss has to last six months.
you better make it good.
Hey, Lynette.
Hey, Judas.
okay, fine. You're still angry, but I'm gonna make it up to you.
when they come after that tree house, they're going to have one Susan Mayer chained to it.
don't do that.
I wanna be sad when they knock it down.
Lynette! - What?
you think you can just walk over here and cute your way out of what you did?
we're supposed to be friends.
exactly, and friends don't put friends in this kind of position.
I love you, but you can't ask me to put your kids ahead of my husband.
no, Parker, that guy doesn't have freezing...
you're right. I shouldn't have done that.
but that tree house is the one place my kids can go and not hear about body scans and white blood cell counts.
it is their getaway from this horrible thing that I've brought into the house.
brought?
sweetie, it's not your fault that you're sick.
I know that...here.
but here...it feels like I've ruined their childhood.
okay, if anybody needs me, I'll be at the hardware ore buying chains.
Oh, Jeez. Get over here.
hello there!
Oh, look, it's our new queen... Katherine of arrogant.
Hey, where's the wrecking ball?
actually, I came to tell you the tree house can stay.
Oh, my God. That's great!
Yes.
if anyone complains, we'll say it was grandfathered in under the previous administration.
Wow.
Thanks.
Why?
clearly, it means a lot to you, and I wanna be a good neighbor.
what's with you? Sometimes you act like an ice queen, and then you do something really nice.
you are one complicated lady.
well, I've had one complicated life.
I've had a lot of men in my life, but I never let myself fall in love before.
I thought it was because I didn't wanna get hurt, but...now I know the pain you feel isn't the worst part.
it's the hate.
could you make it out to "cash"?
Hello, Katherine.
you here about the fountain?
Yes, but don't worry. There's no strict deadline. You can...have it removed at your earliest convenience.
Yeah, I don't think it's going anywhere.
Oh, boys, boys, the war's over.
Yes, it is.
we know all about Chicago.
come again?
my ex is on the board of Chicago memorial hospital.
seems your husband made quite a stir there...whole hospital still buzzing about what he did.
whatever you heard is a vicious lie...every word of it.
still, it was enough to...make you leave town, which begs the question, do you like living here?
Oh, good. We're in agreement. The fountain stays.
thanks for stopping by, Katherine.
it's the same for all of us.
we try not to get too close to the people who live next door.
it's easier to give them a polite nod than to ask what's wrong.
it's safer to keep walking by than to get involved...
you right now. Okay, I don't wanna work...
true, we sometimes do get to know the people we share a fence with and end up lifelong friends.
thanks for everything. - Thank you.
but mostly, we keep our distance because we'd rather our neighbors know nothing about us...than know too much.
five kids are tough enough, but your husband makes six, and that's where I draw the line.
an old friend paid Adam a visit.
aren't you gonna invite me in?
after you ruined my life?
I don't think so.
you should've told the truth about us.
Mike got help...
from an unexpected source.
Victor ashed out...
come on! Get up!
and Carlos and Gaby...
we need to ask you a few questions.
sorry. I guess I don't remember anything.
finally met their match.
I remember everything.
it was supposed to be a beautiful day.
kids should have been playing in the park.
husbands should have been doing their chores.
women should have been tending their flowers.
but at 2: 26 that afternoon, a tornado came to Wisteria lane...
bringing with it...
unbelievable...destruction.
no one could have anticipated it...
especially given how the day started.
sorry. Can you say that again?
I don't think I heard you right.
Carlos and I are back together.
Gaby, you just got married.
and some of us gave you very expensive wedding gifts.
uh, you want the fondue set back? Fine.
but don't act like it cost a bundle,'cause it clearly didn't.
I got you the fondue set.
Oh. Right. It's nice.
Oh, my god. This is gonna kill Edie.
you would think so, but no such luck.
that vindictive hag told Victor everything.
Victor knows?
Yeah, and seeing how he's the rich mayor of a small town with various thugs and cops at his disposal, Carlos and I thought it would be safer if we got the heck out of dodge.
you're leaving Fairview?
Yeah. This afternoon.
no.
you can't be serious.
look, we'll be back... someday.
we just have to wait till this all blows over.
I can't believe this.
I know. This is... a lousy way to say good-bye.
and I'm sorry, but I don't have a choice.
do you guys have any idea how much I'm gonna miss you?
Hey, you heard the news?
a tornado just hit Mount Pleasant, and they think we could get one, too.
y'all better head inside and start getting ready.
um, go. You guys go.
Yeah, and--and we don't need to say good-bye anyway, 'cause we're gonna see you real soon.
and everything will be just the way it was.
sadly, this was not to be.
in four short hours, one of these women would lose a husband, and all of them would lose a friend.
but how could they have known this?
it was supposed to be a beautiful day.
by noon that day, a tornado watch was in effect on Wisteria lane, and every one of its residents was preparing for the storm -
everyone, that is, except Gabrielle Solis, who was more concerned about another storm on the horizon.
mayor Lang, recovering from his injuries, will reportedly be released from the hospital tomorrow.
until then, the deputy mayor will be coordinating Fairview's emergency response as the city remains on tornado watch. It has been over 50 years...
I turned off the gas and locked your car in the garage.
I'm gonna go gramy passport from the safe-deposit box before they close the bank.
what's wrong?
they said Victor's getting out of the hospital... tomorrow.
relax. We're gonna be gone before they give him his last sponge bath.
and remember, the accountant's dropping off the papers for my Cayman island account.
I can't deal with that right now. I'm packing.
Gaby, those documents give us access to $10 million. Multitask.
I told you just to pack the essentials.
that's what I'm doing.
is that a boa?
Carlos, if you are taking me somewhere where I don't need a boa, then I don't want to go.
fine.
you could be a little bit more sensitive.
I had to say good-bye to my friends today.
Yes, I'm sorry.
and I should probably go over and say something to Edie.
like what?
rot in hell, you maggoty whore?
that woman ruined our lives.
if she had kept her mouth shut, we wouldn't be running away.
I know, but I can't help feeling a little guilty.
I mean, do you ever even think about what we did to Edie?
who cares?!
thanks to her, I'm giving up my home, my friends, half my wardrobe.
so do me a favor and never mention her name again unless it's followed by the phrase,"that conniving skank."
ya think you can do that?
Hey, Lynette.
Hi. Did you hear they declared a tornado watch?
scary, huh?
Yeah, well, don't worry about me.
I'm ready for anything.
it's sweet of you to drop by, though.
Oh, yeah. Well, you're welcome.
okay.
um... can we stay in your basement?
what?
well, if this tornado watch gets upgraded to a warning, we're gonna need a place to wait it out.
who exactly is "we"?
"We"--me, Tom, the kids.
that family you've come to know and love.
all seven of you?
Yeah.
well, first of all, I only love four of you.
and second, no way in hell.
Mrs. Mccluskey, please?
it's a small basement, Lynette.
I've already invited Ida over.
we just wanna play some cards and wait this thing out in peace and quiet.
we can be quiet... relative to the storm.
look, there's a shelter over at 3rd and grove.
why don't you go over there?
that's in the middle of skid row.
you think I want my kids around a bunch of winos?
Ida's off the wagon.
it's not gonna be much better here.
I am asking you as a friend. Please?
you're not gonna let this thing go, are you?
Thanks. And don't worry.
I'll have a talk with my kids.
I promise th'll keep a lid on the destruction.
relative to the storm.
Yeah.
Dylan, we're fine.
it's just a tornado watch.
no. We paid a lot of money for this class trip, and I want you to stay and enjoy it.
tell Julie I'll keep an eye on her mom.
gotta go.
what the hell are you doing here?
I just came to talk to Adam.
I like your hair long.
this is harassment.
I will call the police.
I don't think so.
you'd have to tell them what happened with me and your husband.
you don't want people knowing about that.
in case you'd forgotten, Adam wants nothing to do with you.
Oh?
didn't seem that way yesterday.
he didn't tell you I stopped by?
I hope he's not starting to keep things from you...again.
here. I brought you a few things in case there is a tornado.
tape, batteries, a radio.
how'd you know I need this stuff?
an educated guess.
Hey, actually, um, since you're here,
I was thinking that maybe it would be a good idea to tell Orson about Mike's, you know... drug problem.
good, because I already...told him.
you did? When?
last week.
I was afraid that Mike might go to Orson for pills.
I'm sorry, so... Orson already knows about Mike?
did I do something wrong?
no. No, you didn't do anything wrong.
thanks for the supplies.
I don't believe a word you say.
so you still don't think I slept with Adam?
of course not.
Oh, well, let me paint a picture for you.
me lying in his arms, him wondering out loud how he ended up marrying such a cold, hard bitch.
Katherine, are you all right?
I-I couldn't help noticing.
of course you couldn't.
and everything's fine.
thank you.
hi there. I-I don't mean to intrude, but are you all right?
not really, no.
would you like a nice cup of tea?
the national weather service has extended the tornado watch to the tri-county area.
funnel clouds have been spotted in the counties of Mansfield and Webster...
I can't believe you're being so nice.
you don't even know me.
well, I know Katherine, and believe me, you're not the only person I've seen her reduce to tears.
did you see her spit on me?
Yes. That was unfortunate.
if you need any antibacterial soap, I...
Nah, I'm good.
so, um, why on earth would Katherine treat you so dreadfully?
Oh, she's just mad 'cause her husband's in love with me.
Really?
I was one of his patients back in Chicago.
from the moment we met, there was this intense passion.
we tried to fight it, but we couldn't.
well, you're only human.
I know he's miserable without me, even though she tries to pretend that they're happy.
I mean, you're their neighbor.
you think they're happy?
well, they seem... content.
well, they're not.
it was just an observation.
Yeah, a stupid one.
okay.
this has been... lovely.
we really should, um, do it again sometime.
you think I'm making this up?
we were lovers.
I can prove it.
he has a snake tattoo on his right shoulder.
I licked it.
be that as it may, I really think you should go now.
no one believes me!
she has you all brainwashed!
Sylvia, where are you going?
Sylvia, you need to come out of there.
ask Adam! He'll tell you the truth!
well, Adam is not here, and there is a tornado coming.
and as you may have gleaned from the batteries and bottled water, that bathroom is where we are planning on riding it out.
so would you please be a dear and come on out?
go get Adam!
and... open wide.
Orson, we need to talk.
Susan. I'm with a patient.
Yeah, I can see that.
Hi. I'm his neighbor. Cute shoes.
why the hell would you give Mike drugs?
uh... Mrs. Kowalsky...
we're gonna step out for just a moment.
no need. I'll be quick.
cause I'm sure you have a very good reason for giving Mike pills when you know that he has a drug problem.
so... what is your very good reason?
okay, this may take a while.
you might want to spit.
Mike was having a lot of pain with his shoulder.
Oh, of course, and you know all about shoulder pain...
being a dentist.
I thought I was helping.
by giving pills to an addict?
does that sound helpful to you, Mrs. Kowalsky?
thank you.
finally, some sanity.
Susan, you have to leave.
fine.
but you know, if I find out that you have given Mike so much as a breath mint, trust me, there is not enough novocaine in this office to numb the pain I will inflict on you.
Hi, Miss Britt.
you need some bottled water before the storm hits?
well, thanks, Jeremy.
20 bucks.
hold it.
you are price gouging right before a tornado?
I was just trying to make some money.
you really wanna make some money?
go hit up Gabrielle Solis.
she hasn't met a price tag she didn't like.
I already tried.
she and Mr. Solis are moving.
moving?
Yeah. They're loading up their car and everything.
they didn't tell you?
well, they probably didn't want a big emotional scene.
too bad.
see me Susan what was I supposed to do, Mike?
leave 'em in your truck?
I'm not gonna sit back and watch you spin out of control.
out of control?
have I ever missed a mortgage payment? - What?
or disappeared for days on end, or O. D.'D in an alley?
no. I go to work every day.
I help out around the house.
I take care of you and Julie.
what's the problem?
what's the problem?
let's see. You lied to me.
uh, your drug dealer almost dated my daughter.
you lied to me some more, and then I find out that you hit up my best friend's husband for more pills.
you're blowing this out of proportion.
and you're kind of yelling at me--also a problem.
I'm sorry.
I'm in pain.
you might think you have things under control, but they're only gonna get worse...
and with a baby on the way.
I'm sick of explaining myself.
if I need a pill now and then, I'll take one.
so where are they?
I'm serious, Susan.
give 'em to me.
forget it.
Hey, don't walk away from me! Susan!
let go of me!
touching down outside Mount Pleasant.
we can confirm 6 dead and more than 200 injured, with the total only expected to rise...
my wife needs to be seen immediately.
she's pregnant. She fell down the stairs.
any bleeding?
uh, no.
cramping?
uh, I think I just twisted my ankle, but I would like to get checked out anyway.
sure, but for non-emergency cases, it's gonna be a long wait.
well, she's pregnant. Doesn't that make it an emergency?
sir, I'm sorry. You're just gonna have to wait.
it's okay.
how could you not have told me Sylvia was here?
I was trying not to upset you.
well, you failed.
at least if you had warned me,
I wouldn't have been blindsided when she showed up on our front lawn.
I'm sorry.
look, I'll call the police.
I'll get a restraining order.
I'll do whatever it takes to get this woman out of our lives.
Bree. Hello.
Hi, Katherine.
could I borrow Adam for a second?
I have a... situation on my hands.
she's over there, first door on the left, and please hurry.
what is she doing there in the first place?
I saw her weeping. I wanted to help.
you wanted dirt, and I'll bet she told you plenty.
I can't help having a sympathetic face.
I need you to come out here, okay?
is that you, darling?
don't call him that!
I'm not coming out if she's here!
I'm not leaving you alone with my husband.
just come out!
I'll get rid of her!
ladies.
so what'd she tell you?
that she had an affair with Adam.
well, she didn't.
she was his patient-- a pathetic, lonely woman.
one day, for no other reason than sheer pity, he gave her a little kiss.
Sylvia took this to mean that they were in love.
and when Adam told her otherwise, she had a breakdown and accused him of sexual assault.
Oh, my god.
what did you do?
we settled out of court.
I wanted to fight it, but Adam was afraid of losing his license.
of course, we lost everything else-- our home, our...
savings and our friends.
so this is why you moved back to Fairview?
it was supposed to be our fresh start.
so... now you know our dirty little secret.
well, Katherine, for what it's worth...
I would've spit in her face, too.
what's that noise?
is... is that the tornado?
worse. It's the Scavos.
Hey, we're here!
I know!
all right, guys. Come on. Stake out your places.
this our spot! We called it!
you can't call a spot this soon!
can so!
ow, my head!
Lynette? I'm begging.
Oh. Sorry. Kinda get used to it.
come here. Give that to mama.
Hey, guys?
come on now.
knock it off.
here you go.
and... first base, second base, third base, sit.
we gonna have a nice quiet tornado watch, and nobody's gonna cause any problems.
is there a cat here?
Oh, yes. I brought Toby.
is something wrong?
I didn't realize there'd be a cat.
Tom's really allergic.
it sets off my asthma.
Ida, is there any chance that we could put little Toby upstairs?
upstairs?
Yeah. He'd be very safe.
we could put him in a closet.
sure.
why don't we put penny with him, since it's safe?
what?
Toby is Ida's baby, Lynette.
no, Toby's an animal, and my husband, a human being, will get very sick if he stays down here, so, please, put the cat upstairs.
look, I invited Ida to come here.
you, I'm doing a favor for.
if you're not happy with the accommodations, you're free to leave.
Hey, I'll just stay over here.
may--maybe it won't get any worse.
no, that's ridiculous.
Karen, come on.
sorry. Theat stays.
knock yourself out.
start him on I. V.
are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just worried about you.
how long are they gonna keep us waitin'?
are you sure that's all it is?
Hey! Hey, we were here way before these people.
sir, they're seeing everyone on an emergency basis.
this woman is hemorrhaging.
Danny, can you take her in?
what, you gotta see blood before you'll treat somebody?
my wife's pregnant, and she fell down a flight of stairs.
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you to be patient.
these people are bleeding.
I can absolutely wait.
I'm just asking them to take a look at you, okay?
hell, you could've done it while you're standing here talking to me, right?
sir, we'll get to your wife as soon as we can.
now please take a seat.
just take a look at her!
get the hell off of me!
Mike, stop!
I need security here now.
Dr. Roth, blood lab 7.
Dr. Roth, blood lab 7.
Hey.
when you gonna let me out of these things?
when your wife's done and you're ready to go home.
the doctor said the baby's fine.
Oh, thank god.
and, uh, your ankle?
just a mild sprain.
how you doing?
I've had better days.
I am so sorry.
it's gonna be okay.
I talked to the doctor, and, um, they have a rehab facility they work with.
Thanks.
I don't need rehab.
I can kick this myself.
I've done it before.
you keep saying that, and it just keeps getting worse.
Susan, look at me.
I'm handcuffed to a chair.
I think I've hit bottom here.
I will fix this.
just no rehab.
Mrs. Delfino?
the doctor asked me to give you these, for the pain.
Oh, my god. Are you kidding me?
I've kind of had a rough day here.
no.
I've just gotta get through is.
no.
there's no tomorrow.
it's now.
you will quit this now.
you will go to rehab, or so help me, I will leave you.
I will take this baby, and I will leave you.
you win.
I'll go.
Excusee?
sorry. I'm in a rush.
my wife's alone with the kids, and I have to get home before the storm hits.
this is the information Carlos asked for.
about what?
about the Cayman island account.
didn't he tell you I was coming?
Yeah, of course he did.
uh, he said you'd be stopping by.
Duh.
this is everything you need to access the money.
I washed my hands of this, so whatever you do, don't lose that folder. Got it?
believe me, I won't let it out of my sight.
all right. Nice to finally meet you, Gabrielle.
you're just as pretty as Carlos said you were.
Oh, no. I'm prettier.
Edie, what have you got there?!
Oh, crap!
residents are advised to seek shelter at once.
again, do not evacuate.
stay where you are and seek shelter in a basement or any windowless room.
you okay?
my throat is closing up.
I think I gotta go upstairs.
no. No, no, no, no, no.
you stay here.
Edie, you thief! Open this door now!
I've called the police!
they're on their way, and they are going to taser your ass!
Oh, good. You're home.
what the hell did I tell you?!
I'm not gonna sit and watch my husband suffocate.
well, I don't want Ida to wake up and find her cat missing.
Karen, after all our years of friendship, how can you choose a cat over my husband?
you think we're friends?
of course.
Really?
you ever stop by just to say hi or invite me for a cup of tea?
Ida does.
what are you talking about?
I had you over for lemonade last week.
while I was drinking it, you went to the store, and I watched the kids face it. The only time we're friends is when you need something.
that is not true.
I genuinely care about you.
you mean like today, when you came by to check on me?
Oh, that's right, you only wanted a basement, oh!
damn it, Toby! - Hey, hold it! Hold it!
you can't go out there!
that stupid cat is the only family that Ida's got!
now this is what friends do!
give me the damn folder, Edie!
not gonna happen!
it's worthless to you!
you and Carlos are screwed without it, and that is worth a lot to me.
give me my money!
your money?
Carlos embezzled it.
Oh, now you're moral all of a sudden?
you didn't care where the money was coming from when youhought Carlos was gonna spend it on you!
okay, I'm not unreasonable.
cut me in for, say, 60%, and I'll go away.
how's that sound?
No!
get you!
Edie! - Give me that!
No!
let go! - No, you!
let go! - You!
No! No!
what did you do?!
what did you do, Edie?!
get in the house.
now!
you gotta get inside now! - He's right there!
damn it! I'm not gonna let you die, so don't make me drag you!
Oh, crap.
Oh! Hurry! Go!
come on!
get in!
I have a crawl space.
I think we can both fit.
you just threw my money in a tornado.
I am not getting in there with you.
fine! Then stay out there and die.
move your ass!
come on, Sylvia.
please open the door.
thank god you're here. We need to get into the bathroom.
we can't. There's a woman in there.
well, tell her to hurry it up.
no, no, no, she's barricaded herself in there.
she's a patient of mine who's had a little meltdown.
just give me five minutes.
we don't have time.
there's a funnel cloud out there.
open the damn door! - Go to hell!
quick! In here, in here.
come on! - Hurry up!
get in, get in!
get in!
hang on! Hang onto this!
can I say something?
what?
I'm sorry Carlos and I lied to you.
I know we hurt you, and I wish it didn't happen the way it did, and I-I just want you to know that.
why are you talking like that?
well, I thought just in case we... - Oh, no, you don't.
you just shut the hell up.
we're not doing deathbed confessions here.
we're gonna get through this.
I'm gonna go on hating you for years to come.
you really hate me?
Yes.
no.
it's just that I really let myself fall for him, which was stupid because I always knew that he'd go back to you.
well, I'm still sorry, though.
I said shut the hell up.
I think it's possible Benjamin might need changing.
that went beyond the hypothetical a good ten minutes ago.
we're giving you shelter. You could at least be gracious.
we wouldn't need shelter if you hadn't dragged us over here.
Oh, so now it's my fault that that lunatic commandeered our safe room?
if you hadn't been dying to know our business, she wouldn't have gotten in there.
can we stop pointing fingers?
this isn't Bree's fault.
you're right.
sorry.
but you can understand why I'm upset, having that insane woman back in our lives.
I can only imagine. I had to listen to her babble for an hour.
what kind of things was she saying?
she said that she and Adam were lovers and she could prove it because he had a tattoo, and...
what?
she said he had a tattoo on his shoulder, which I know isn't true because I've seen him at the pool, and I would've remembered because tattooed people make me very uncomfortable.
did she say what kind of tattoo it was?
a snake. What's the difference? He doesn't have one.
he did...
back in Chicago.
he had it removed.
sorry.
Katherine... - so...
that's why we settled?
why we lost everything?
I'm sorry, but you have to understand... - no, I do not.
sorry.
not here.
not now.
change of plans!
we gotta get in the basement now!
damn it. Where are you?
Where's Gaby?
I thought she was with you.
I don't know where she is.
I guess we'll have to wait for her together.
do you mind if I say something?
look, Gaby and I never planned to get back together, Victor.
we tried to keep away from each other.
we really did.
I don't know. It's like we're two halves of the same person or somethin'.
and when we're apart, W...
we just aren't happy, which is why we...
we never set out to hurt you, Victor, and I'm sorry we did.
are you done?
Yeah.
come on, Carlos!
you better get in the house!
you could get hurt out here!
Hello!
where is everyone?!
did you hear that?
Adam, I'm leaving!
this is your last chance to come with me, or I'm gonna tell everyone exactly what happened!
okay.
you've made your choice!
here I go!
it's here.
it was supposed to be a beautiful day.
but then the winds came and changed everything...
and not just the houses and the lawns.
Oh, my god.
the people had changed, too.
while the storm had raged, each of them had learned something...
about friendship...
and forgiveness...
and redemption.
and some had learned the hardest lesson of all...
that life is always fragile and very often...unfair.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
help me!
help me, Tom!
<the best wish for Tom and Lyneet...>
Gaby's new tenant...
I understand you got a room to rent.
we like you.
if you have first and last months' rent, we'd like you even more.
came with a dangerous secret.
I'm your father.
Wayne's return meant trouble for katherine.
she doesn't know you, but I do.
did you have anything to do with the fire at Rick's restaurant?
Lynette tried to warn Tom about Kayla...
I think we have a seriously troubled young girl.
and in his time of weakness, Orson chose the wrong shoulder to cry on.
I don't... think...
you're right.
the incident-- as it would come to be known
happened late on a tuesday afternoon.
witnesses included an old woman...
a blind man...
and a young boy.
the old woman, whose hearing was not what it used to be, saw Bree hodge emerge from her house in a way that told her she was upset about something.
the blind man, whose hearing had become more acute, heard edie say...
Oh, hey, Bree. What's up?
in a way that suggested Edie wasn't expecting any trouble.
the young boy, who was not yet 11, heard Bree Hodge say...
I saw you kissing my husband.
but he couldn't understand why someone would be angry about kisses, which he thought grown-ups liked.
as the old woman pretended to clip hedges she'd already clipped, she saw the body language of her neighbors change.
as the blind man listened in, he heard Bree say...
what were you thinking, Edie? We're supposed to be friends.
we are friends. I am not interested in Orson.
the young boy then heard Edie add...
so stop acting like such a bitch!
which included a word he was not allowed to use.
the old woman then saw Bree Hodge clench her fist.
a second later, the blind man heard a slap...
and the young boy saw Edie grab her cheek.
as the two women parted company, a thought occurred to all those who had witnessed the incident...
that right there on peaceful wisteria lane, the battle lines had been drawn, and someone...was going to get hurt.
it happens the second sunday of every May.
children purchase tasteful bouquets...
sign sentimental cards...
and create homemade jewelry...
all in an attempt to honor that woman known simply...
as mother.
Hey, mama. - hey, baby.
Oh, my gosh!
is this my daughter-in-law?
well, I'm gonna hug her.
it's nice to meet you.
Oh, my goodness! - Oh, okay.
Oh, my son was right.
you are the prettiest thing!
Michael, I'm just taken with her.
Oh, well, good. Thank you.
come on, mama. Let's get you unpacked.
Oh, yes, let's do, 'cause I brought you a present. let's go. Come on.
it's all recipes.
not just any recipes.
some of these have been in my family since before the war of northern aggression.
you mean the civil war?
I mean what I mean.
um, well...
I guess Mike didn't tell you that i'm, uh, really not a cook.
Oh, no, he told me.
that's why I gave you these recipes, and I'm gon' teach you how to make 'em, too.
isn't that nice, honey?
my meemaw always told me that a lady should be a chef in the kitchen, a maid in the living room and a whore in the bedroom.
and Michael says you've only got one of those covered, so I'm gon' help you with the other two.
excuse me.
the one she won't be helping me with-- please tell me it's "whore."
I call the computer. - no way! I called it on the bus.
guys, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
there's somebody I want you to meet.
this is dr. Dolan. - Hey, guys. I'm joshua.
he's gonna hang out and watch us, you know, be a family.
Why?
because we've had a couple of... problems lately.
and my job is to find out what's causing those problems, and then I can help you be a stronger family.
can we be a stronger family while playing "age of empires iii"?
Yeah, sure. I wanna learn how to play that game.
go get started. I'll join you in a minute.
so I like what you said about making the family stronger, but as I told you, Kayla's the one you wanna focus on.
well, I prefer to look at the big picture.
you see, if a family is dysfunctional, it can lead to a child with problems.
Yeah, or a kid with problems can lead to a dysfunctial family.
I mean, Kayla's the one that got my kids to light a fire and jump off the roof.
honey, it--it sounds like Dr. Dolan has, um, kind of a plan here.
I understand. It just seems like...
at $140 an hour, we could skip straight to the part where you sit down with Kayla and tell her to stop being so evil.
mommy? - Yeah?
I forgot to give you something.
it's a drawing I made for you in school.
Oh, well, thank you. It's beautiful. Thank you.
she never does this.
don't. We're waiting for Ellie. She's finishing up with a customer.
well, maybe when she's done tattooing him, she can put "stop hitting the blind guy" on my forehead.
you know, I've been hitting you a lot less lately, and I don't feel like I'm getting enough credit for that.
you're right. I'm a bad husband.
no, seriously. We're getting along better. Have you noticed that?
Yeah, I think it's because of Ellie.
me, too.
it's impossible to argue with her in the house.
she makes us laugh. She takes you off my hands every once in a while.
Plus, she's always helping around the house.
I mean, yesterday, without even being asked, she washed all the windows.
she's amazing.
I don't know where she gets all her energy.
okay, so we're square.
dude, you gotta call me next week. I got some great stuff coming in.
all right.
Ellie, it's getting cold!
I'll be rit down!
so should I sneak out the back?
Oh, no. That's my landlady. She's cool.
she knows you're dealing?
well, she's not that cool.
Oh, hey, guys!
you were up there a while. Can I see it?
um, she-- she means the tattoo.
I would love for you to see it...
but it's kind of down south.
Oh, on his... got it.
does it hurt?
it's okay.
Ellie gave me something for the pain.
and fairview has a top-rated school district, which, uh...
you'll appreciate in a couple of years.
well, come on in. I'll show you the inside.
you go ahead, honey. I'll wait until mark wakes up from his nap.
all right, we'll see you in a minute. - okay.
I'm Bree Hodge.
Lauren baxter. Nice to meet you.
so are you thinking of moving onto the lane?
Yes. This house is exactly what we've been looking for.
do you mind if I ask-- is it a safe neighborhood?
Oh, yes, the neighborhood's safe.
I wish I could say the same for your real estate agent.
well, what do you mean?
what is this?
you left it in the printer.
it's a house listing.
Yeah, for a house in baltimore.
Yeah, wai till you see it. It's got a pool and a garden.
this is about dad, isn't it?
I'm doing this to protect us.
we don't need to be protected. He's changed.
it's all an act, sweetheart. You don't see it now, but you will.
he's only back because he wants something.
I don't know what exactly.
I just know we're not safe here.
Oh, sure. That's it. Dad has some evil plan.
it couldn't be that he wants to be in my life, that he loves me.
he isn't capable of love, Dylan.
I found that out the hard way, and we need to leave before you learn the same horrible lesson.
move if you want.
I'm staying here with my father.
but what happened? Things were going fine.
I'm sorry. We need another realtor.
all right.
biscuits are the foundation of any southern meal.
like my meemaw used to say, "ain't nothin' you can make don't taste better on a biscuit.
a fount of wisdom, your meemaw.
well... I really appreciate this. Thanks, adele.
if you don't call me "mama," I'm gonna scream.
don't do that... mama.
now let's get started.
we're gonna need a flour sifter.
I don't have one.
pastry cutter? - Sorry.
dough hooks?
don't even know what they are.
that's fine. We can improvise.
why don't you start by measuring out our dry ingredients?
the flour and such?
michael is gonna be so happy.
after a long day of work, he can come home to a nice, home-cooked southern meal.
you know, it's a shame that Michael has to work so hard.
but I guess with all the money troubles you two have been havin'...
he told you that?
well, we're getting past it.
only because my son is working himself to the bone.
you know, it wouldn't hurt for you to get a job.
I have a job.
Oh, you mean your little drawings?
well, it's great for a woman to have a hobby.
personally, I decoupage, but I'm talking about something that pays.
children's books pay.
Really? How much?
Oh, dear. I've insulted you.
now I'm just trying to be helpful.
no, no. It's fine, adele.
mama.
so we were sort of surprised to get your call.
don't you need to see Kayla a few more times before you report back to us?
well, before continuing with her, I thought it might be helpful to ask you a few questions.
Oh, go ahead. Shoot.
do you love Kayla?
I was talking to you.
well... s-sure.
I've been very good to her.
that wasn't his question.
do you have a diploma on your wall, Tom? I don't think so. Zip it.
again, um... do you love her?
of course I do...
as much as I can, given the way she joined our family.
it's just--it's complicated.
I understand.
the problem is, Kayla has picked up on your ambivalence, and she's become a very angry girl.
so what do we do?
Oh, god.
is this gonna be one of those therapy things where she hits me with a foam bat?
there's a bond that develops between an infant and her mother.
you and Kayla never formed that bond, so what we need to do is recreate it.
it's called attachment parenting, and it starts with Kayla being by your side as often as possible.
that sounds like exactly what they need.
I mean, I don't have a diploma or anything, but...
I'd really like to give this a try.
whatever keeps you and Kayla close and interacting
go to the movies, go shopping, maybe take a little trip together, just the two of you.
could we revisit the foam bat idea for just a second?
the plan sounds great, doc. Don't worry.
I will make sure that they are together constantly.
ask me if i love Tom right now. Go ahead. I dare ya.
may I help you?
I haven't seen Benjamin in a week.
I was thinking I'd take him for a few hours.
it's not really a good time.
well, Bree, whenever I call, it's not a good time, so if you don't mind, I'd like to take my son to the carnival.
well, that sounds boring. I know.
why don't you take him to Edie's house, and he can watch you give her a dental exam with your tongue?
Bree, you don't understand.
what you saw was bad judgment on Edie's part and good judgment on my part.
I pushed her away.
Yes, eventually, with a big, dopey grin on your face.
can we please put this behind us?
I would like to take Benjamin.
I don't think so.
I'd hate for him to be around with you lest you had another attack of delayed morality, either with Edie or behind the wheel of your car.
I am not having this argument.
he is my son, too.
not exactly.
what? Don't even...
strictly speaking, you're not even related to him.
I mean, it was fine for you to masquerade as his father when we were together, - but now that we're not- - this is wrong.
I will hire a lawyer.
I've already hired one.
you'll be hearing from him shortly.
Oh, and if you're in the mood for a carnival, why not call Edie?
I hear you get three throws for a dollar with her, too.
Bye, Gaby.
you guys going for another walk?
Yeah. We found this sweet hiking trail-- goes right through the middle of the woods.
Yeah, and unlike some people, Ellie doesn't let the branches hit me in my face.
you're spoiling him.
what the hell?
Ellie, your door is locked! Ellie!
Oh, shut up already.
mom, guess what? Dad's coming to my senior recital next week.
I could swing by and pick you up, if you want.
we could make it a real family outing.
Dylan, your father and i need to talk... in private.
I'm not done saying good-bye.
Yes, you are.
please get rid of that gum.
I can hear you smacking all the way in the house.
Bye, sweetheart. - Bye, dad.
just so we're clear, there will be no family outings.
now, Kathy, you shouldn't be rude to a man who still has feelings for you.
meaning what? You still love me?
I do.
and I know I'm somewhat to blame for what's happened between us.
that's why I've forgiven you for kidnapping our daughter.
the least you can do is meet me halfway.
I don't deserve your forgiveness.
maybe not, but I'm gonna give it to you anyway 'cause...
I still think we could be happy together.
could we?
given all the things I did that you don't know about?
what's that?
I'm talking about all those men I was with while we were married.
how can you forgive something like that?
that's a lie.
you wouldn't have dared.
unhappy women do dangerous things.
I think the worst was when I tricked you into thinking Dylan was yours.
I wanted to tell you the truth, but I was scared...
for obvious reasons.
I don't believe you.
but I'm not worried anymore because you've changed.
so what are you waiting for, Wayne?
forgive me.
hey there! Mrs. Mccluskey.
if she's not mine, then whose is she?
does it matter?
Oh, guess I won't be seeing you at the recital now.
what a shame.
are you sure it was cocaine?
Carlos, I was a fashion model in the '90s.
I know cocaine.
damn it.
what are you doing?
I'm calling the police.
shouldn't we hear Ellis side of the story first?
here's ellie's side.
selling drugs brings in more money than waiting tables.
there you go. Were you moved?
okay, look, maybe I was wrong. Maybe it was flour. Maybe she's a pastry chef.
Yeah! And she came up with that tattoo cover story to hide her illicit baking.
all right, look, I know we have to do something, but this woman's our friend.
Yes, and I'm a convicted felon still on probation.
now if the police find out we're harboring a drug dealer, they're gonna fry me.
we have to turn her in.
well, the priority for me is working out custody of Benjamin.
to that end, I've written down all the pertinent facts about the situation.
no, I don't want to do this over the phone.
uh, listen. I'm gonna hop in the shower.
how about we meet in your office in about an hour?
great. Thanks.
the, uh, the door's open.
Edie? What are you doing here?
get out here, you wuss.
that puritanical robot bitch of yours is sabotaging my business.
okay, hang on a second. I'll be right out.
you know, uh, Orson... forget it.
just--just take a nice, long shower.
Really? You sure?
Yeah.
uh, now that I think about it, I can handle Bree all by myself.
bricks of cocaine under her bed.
I mean, I-I mean, I think it was cocaine, and I think they're called bricks.
I'm just a simple housewife. I don't know what I'm saying.
well, you've done the right thing, and it's thanks to the cooperation of citizens like you。
Yeah, yeah, yeah. When are you gonna get her out of our house?
well, it's a little more complicated than that.
Meaning?
Oh, my god! - What?
what? I can't see anything.
it's one of Ellie's customers.
actually, I'm detective bullock.
we've been tracking Miss Leonard for several months now.
okay, so if you know what she's doing, then why don't you just bust her?
she's small-time.
we're trying to get to her supplier, so we need her to keep dealing.
wait. So you're just gonna leave a drug dealer in our house?
Yes.
for now we just need you to act normal, pretend like you don't know anything.
we'll move in when the case is made.
okay, look, I'm all for doing my civic duty, but this woman-- she's...
sort of a.. friend.
and now you're asking us to trick her?
I'm not sure we're comfortable with this.
Mr. Solis, you're on probation, right?
how'd you like not to be?
what on earth could you possibly want?
Oh, I wanted to thank you.
after you scared off that couple that were going to buy the young house,I, uh, found another buyer, and they're willing to go 10% over asking.
well, good, when they drop by for their inspection,I'll just have to have a nice little chat with them, too.
you wouldn't wanna do that to me.
and after all, we're family.
family?
well, yes, since my nephew Austin is Benjamin's biological father, that makes me benjy's great-aunt
a term I don't exactly love, but it's better than "grandma," which is what you are.
how did you...
cute story. I-I went over to Orson's to ask him to get you off my back, and the poor sap-- he--he'd written the whole sordid tale down and left it right there on the table.
Edie, if word got out, my whole family would be humiliated.
Oh, I don't want word to get out.
that would ruin everything, because right now I...
well, I own you.
what does that mean?
glad you asked.
from this moment on, I am your best friend.
you're gonna invite me to all of your fancy parties, set me up with all your single friends, and, well, if I'm ever in the mood for muffins, you're gonna bake 'em for me.
Edie... please.
and if you don't, if for one second I don't feel the love,
I'm gonna bury you.
you understand?
Yeah. - Good.
Oh, by the way, um, I'm having an open house tomorrow.
a plate of banana nut muffins sure would set the mood. Don't you think?
Hey, honey, could you get that? Thank you.
Hey, Bree, perfect timing. We were just getting ready to deal the cards.
Bree, are you okay?
there's something I've been keeping from all of you, and, um...
we need to talk.
Hey, Wayne.
I finished that D. N.A. You wanted.
I'm probably gonna get in trouble because I put it in front of Martin's triple homicide.
you bad girl. well, I owe you.
I just needed to confirm that the vic and my suspect are related.
Oh, well, actually, they're not.
I ran the samples from the cheek swab and the wad of gum you gave me, and your suspect's not related to the victim at all.
are you sure?
Oh, yeah, it's 100% exclusion. Are you hungry?
cause I worked all through lunch, and I thought that you and i could go get...
Oh, my god.
and Edie threatened to use that to...
Yes.
okay, first of all, you're, like, the greatest mom ever to wanna protect Danielle like that.
thank you.
I can't believe she was blackmailing you.
I can't lieve she made a play for Orson.
I can.
she went after Carlos and Mike and Karl.
the only person she hasn't gone after is Tom.
yet.
this woman is outta control.
what are you gonna do?
no. What are we gonna do?
Hey, guys, what's going on?
I told them everything, Edie, about Orson, Benjamin, everything.
you did?
she did, so you can kiss that little blackmail scheme good-bye.
well, I was only doing it because
you werenly doing it because you're the devil.
okay, fine, chew me out and let's get on with it.
it's not like all the other times, Edie. We're done.
done?
we're not inviting you to poker. We're not talking to you.
we're not even gonna wave when you jog by. From now on, you are invisible.
and we're gonna make sure every woman in a 5-mile radius knows the kind of crap you pulled.
we tried to be your friends, but you don't even understand what that word means, so now we're gonna be something you do understand.
guys, wait. Wait.
I know I crossed a line this time, and, well, I'm--I'm sorry.
did you hear somhing?
neither did I.
over here, honey, look at the camera. Look at the camera.
you ready to ride, Dylan?
now look, if you're scared, you don't have to. - I want to.
no, you're a brave girl.
hold up your arm for the camera, sweetheart.
how many stitches is that? - 11
and you didn't cry once, did you?
can I ride now, please, daddy? - of course, baby.
I love you, daddy.
Dylan, it's me.
uh, you need to come over here tomorrow.
Yeah, I know it's mother's day, but it's okay.
I got some things to tell you about your mother.
Ooh, I want this one.
Yow! It's a little pricey.
but I want it.
you're the one who asked me to go shopping.
well, I know, but we're supposed toe spending time together, not going into debt.
how about this one?
what do you mean, "supposed to"?
I just... it's good for us to hang out. I enjoy it.
is this something that the doctor made you do?
no. All my idea.
I just wanted to treat you to a real fun day.
all right. You want me to have fun? Buy me this.
okay.
good times.
I'd like an old-fashioned, please.
what's the matter, Michael? You tuckered out?
Oh, yeah, I just didn't get much sleep.
honestly, I wonder how you ever get any, well, considering you got Susan in the bed sawing wood all night.
I'm doing what now?
snoring.
What'd you say it sounded like, Michael?
a bunch of bulldogs in a bag?
but it is a sound that I've come to love.
you know what my meemaw did to grandpa boo?
she sewed a marble in the back of his pajama top, then if he rolled on his back to start snorin', it'd wake him right up.
but I guess you can't do that, seeing as how you sleep in the nude and all.
well, that's gonna change real soon.
I'm gon' fix my face before I order. Excuse me.
Oh, this is nice.
nice? She's driving me crazy.
you have got to stop complaining about me to her.
I don't.. complain.
well, you could see how I, as the nude, snoring whore, would think so.
okay, now I might vent a little bit, but she's just trying to help.
well, the next time she tries to help, she's gonna get an old-fashioned in her face, so you better step up and start defending me.
okay, okay.
well, lovely powder room.
it's amazing that such a busy restaurant can keep their bathroom cleaner than yours.
now, mama, that's-- that's not very nice.
well, you're the one who told me you didn't marry her for her housekeepin'.
you just need someone to teach these things.
you know what?
why don't I stay a few extra weeks, and you and I can spruce the house up?
and don't worry. I'll leave when the baby comes.
at my age, all that crying just cuts my nerves to shreds.
now the first thing we're gonna do...
is wash your walls.
just 'cause we don't walk on 'em doesn't mean they don't get dirty.
Oh, my god! My water broke. - What?
my water just broke. I'm in labor. We have to go.
you're not due for a month.
I don't know what to tell you, mama. Look at me.
come on. We have to get you to the hospital.
well, yes, let's go.
no, no, no, you should take a cab home and start packing.
this one feels like a crier.
well, are you sure I should...
come on.
you're doing great, honey. Just keep breathing.
how close are the contractions?
a few weeks apart.
wanna go to the movies? - What?
I'm not in labor, okay?
but your water broke. I saw it.
that was club soda.
amniotic fluid doesn't have ice cubes and a lemon wedge.
what, you faked that?
I'm sorry. I panicked.
your mother just invited herself to stay with us for three weeks, and you said nothing.
I had to come up with a plan.
well, what happens if we go home with no baby?
I didn't say it was a good plan.
do you see the effect she has on me?
I just thank god I wasn't drinking coffee.
I could've hurt myself.
okay, I get it. I'll talk to her.
thank you.
doou wanna go back in there right now and tell her?
no. No. The restaurant just comped our drinks. We'll tell her at home.
well, we've done enough damage for one day.
let's go home.
I want a corn dog first.
Oh, honey, we're about to have dinner.
but I'm hungry now. I want a corn dog.
all right. Thank you.
if you're hungry, I'll get you something healthy, and you can have it in the car.
corn. Dog. Why can't I have one?
well, at this point, because of the way you're acting.
please don't do this, Kayla. We have been having such a nice time.
and we can keep having a nice time.
just give me what I want, or you're not gonna like what happens.
are you... threatening me?
I'm just saying, I got that idiot Preston to jump off the roof.
wonder what I could get Penny to do.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that, but that was...
that was horrible, what you said.
And--and... you should never say that again.
okay, so... come on. Let's go. Come on.
Oh, Susan, you're up.
michael told me about your false labor. That was unusual.
well, it happens.
I know, but usually your water doesn't break.
Oh, that. turns out I spilled some club soda.
well, no surprise there.
michael told me what a klutzy Kathy you are.
I'm glad he finds that cute.
I myself don't have the patience.
Hey, mama.
Hello, Michael.
do you have a mother's day present for me?
he sure does, but I want mine first.
mama, we need to talk.
about what? - About the way you talk to people.
I mean, um, sometimes you can be a little too... honest.
sorry. Go on.
it's just... you don't realize how things sound when they're coming out of your mouth.
I know you mean well-- ohh!
I'm getting to it.
no, no, no, I-I love where this is going.
it's just that, mama, sometimes when you're talking to Susan
Susan, you look a little pale. Are you okay?
Oh, she's fine. And I wish she'd cut it out.
no, I'm not trying to...
Susan? Are--are you going into labor? For real?
maybe. Who cares? Let her have it.
okay, okay.
mama, you've gotta stop taking potshots at Susan.
she's my wife, and I love her, and I can't have you upsetting her.
sweetheart, I-I am deeply sorry and mortified.
if--if I've caused you any distress, I never meant to hurt your feelings.
apology accepted. Let's go.
happy mother's day!
Oh, my gosh! That is so sweet. Thank you so much.
we're gonna go get your present. - Yeah.
okay.
I hope you like turtles.
so... no Kayla?
well, she's still pretty upset.
again, I know I crossed the line, and I am so sorry.
you know what? Let's not get into this.
I'm just gonna get angry all over again.
Tom, if you had been there and heard what she said...
it doesn't matter. You hit her.
honey, she's just a little girl.
and now thanks to you, she's a frightened little girl.
sorry to bother you, dr. Dolan, but you said I could call anytime.
my mom... she hit me.
no, it's not the first time.
I was afraid to tell you 'cause I knew what she would do if she found out.
please help me. I don't feel safe here.
I have to go. She's coming.
Uh,sorry about the mess.
the maid took the week off.
you said you wanted to talk to me and...
tell me things about mom?
you know what, kiddo? I-I had kind of a bad day yesterday.
I sat around here drinking, feeling sorry for myself. And...
and then I called you.
that's okay. If you're feeling sad or whatever, you should always call me.
none of this is your fault. I hope you know that.
none of what?
I tried so hard to let the past just be the past.
I didn't-- I didn't wanna bring up who did what to who or why.
what did mom say to you?
and it turns out I've been kidding myself all this time.
this family that I've been fighting for-- it just-- it doesn't even...
exist.
we don't need her.
I'm fine with just you and me.
I'm happy now.
dad, you're hurting me.
dad, what's the matter?
you have to go.
what's wrong? Did I do something?
get outta here! Now!
Ellie? Brunch is almost ready!
this is gonna be so hard.
you can't think of her as your friend.
think of her as a drug dealer who could've gotten us into a lot of trouble.
I'll try.
shoot. I wanted to surprise you.
what's this?
well, you know, it's mother's day, and...
I have kind of a crappy relationship with my mom, so...
this is my way of saying thanks for being nicer to me than she ever was.
Oh, honey!
I'm glad I didn't get you the chocolates.
no, Travers, no, I decided spending mother's day with you is more important than spending time showing people stupid houses.
Oh, love you, too, sweetheart.
actually, I think mommy's gonna be spending a lot more time with you from now on.
but we'll talk about that when I get there, okay?
I love you, baby. I'll see you soon.
it happens the second Sunday of every May.
we celebrate the women who give us life and so much more.
the ones who protect us at all costs...
who have the courage to fight those who would do us harm...
who put our happiness ahead of their own.
but mostly...
we celebrate a mother's love, which is constant, eternal...
and there from the very beginning.
Bree discovered a family secret.
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.
Lynette struggled with chemotherapy...
while Susan took joy in being pregnant...
I'm eating for two.
the biggest obstacle to Carlos and Gaby...
the I.R.S. Could make me testify against you.
was the promise Edie forced Carlos to make.
we're engaged.
I really did care for Edie, but I can't let her ruin my life.
Trevor! Over here!
all children love to play games.
but before they can race their bikes or jump their ropes or toss their frisbees, children understand they must first convince their friends to play along with them.
the same is true for adults.
Hi, Gaby. It's me. I'm throwing a party Saturday night. Guess what kind?
a charades party? Didn't you just throw one?
no, that was a year ago.
Oh. Right. Guess it's time for another one.
sure is. Can you come?
um...sorry. Victor needs me at this...political thing. Damn. Damn. Damn.
Aw! You have to come. You're the best charades player I know.
that's sweet and totally accurate.
but I'm really whipped from the chemo, so...
Oh, there's my other line. Can you ask me next time, okay, hon?
okay, bye.
Hello?
Oh, hey, Bree. Mm, what's up?
well, I stopped by Katherine's last night just to get a recipe, and you'll never believe what I overheard.
she slapped her kid?! No!
Yes, and get this... when Adam said Dylan was just going to keep asking questions, Katherine said... and I quote...
well, we're just gonna have to find better lies.
Oh, hang on. I've got another call.
don't answer it! It's Susan. She's hosting another game night.
another one? It's time for an anonymous letter.
Wait...is Katherine going to Susan's charade night? - Probably. Why?
we should go, too.
get a few drinks in her, see if she loosens up.
well, I doubt a woman like Katherine is gonna spill her secrets just - because she's had a little win - I don't know.
you came out with some interesting things before you swore off the sauce well, none that I recall.
didn't you tell me you lost your virginity in the backseat of a...
point well taken. I'll bring the wine.
Susan, good news. We can come to the party after all.
Hey, you know who else you should invite?
Yeah, I am feeling much better, so count me in.
will our new neighbor be coming? - Of course!
I love your charades parties. And I hope you're inviting that delightful Katherine Mayfair.
so you were pa a very nice compliment today.
I was? - Yes.
I am hosting a charades party, and all of my friends went out their way to insist I invite you.
Really? - Mm-hmm.
Yes, not all adults like to play games.
but the ones who do...play to win.
Stella Wingfield hated to cook.
still, she spent that Friday morning grating cheese...and greasing a pan...and laying in macaroni because her eldest daughter was sick, and Stella could no longer sit by and do nothing.
lunch time! - Oh. No, thanks.
Oh, come on. I made it for you special. You've gotta keep your strength up.
I appreciate the effort, but I told you, I can't keep anything down, and F.Y.I.
mac and cheese is halfway to vomit.
you might as well have given me a plate of creamed corn.
aren't you taking the anti-nausea drug?
Yeah, I am taking it. It's just...not working.
well, um...I know something that might help your nausea and boost your appetite.
Um...perhaps a little visit from my old friend...
Mary Jane?
you're suggesting pot? - A lot of chemo patients use it.
hell, I did. - Yeah.
Oh, come on.
let mama score you some kick-ass chronic.
kick-ass chronic? Uh-huh.
you're a grandmother. Shouldn't you be off somewhere knitting an Afghan?
just trying to ease your pain.
well, thanks, but prefer not to get my medication from some guy under a bridge.
suit yourself.
Hey.
what's this? - A crib.
Oh, and look...safety latch. I figured if the baby takes after you, "accident-proof" is key.
honey, you know, I'm still in my first trimester.
um, don't you think it's a little early to be making cribs?
early would be painting it pink or blue. But...I got both, so we're covered either way.
great.
and whether it's a boy or a girl, colts fan.
that's non-negotiable. - Mm.
um, Bree's home. I'll be right back.
look sharp. It's Susan.
God, it's getting harder and harder to keep her at arm's length.
I never knew she was such a hugger.
you want me to run interference? - I'm getting good at props. No, no.
yeah? Good.
Hey, Susan! What's up?
I need a favor.
um, I remember you mentioning that you liked your obstetrician.
can I get his number?
I thought you were using Dr. Mayfair.
Yeah, I don't know. It's getting a little weird.
you know, Adam is my neighbor.
but you don't mind Orson being your dentist.
well, that's because I don't blush when Orson says,"open wide."
you know, my O.B.is all the way across town.
you just do not want to drive that far.
Oh, well, we could schedule our appointments together and carpool. You know...pregnant gals on the road.
it does sound fun, but I don't think my doctor's taking on any new patients.
Oh, I can talk him into it. What's his name?
I, um...don't remember.
you don't remember?
no. You know, I usually just call him "doctor."
Bree, just get me the number.
Ooh.
here you go, but please don't mention my name.
as I said, you know, he's overbooked, and I just don't want to get on his bad side.
I'm so excited. Pregnant gals sharing a doctor!
Ah-choo! - Oh, bless you.
Oh! Sorry, probably just allergies, but, you know, you don't want to take any chances.
right.
Hey. Can I get a drink?
Yeah, sure.
by the way, you missed a spot.
Oh, thanks.
anytime.
I'd say the car is clean enough. - Katherine.
you two seemed awfully friendly.
do you know her? - We said two words. No.
she criticized my car washing. - Hmm. It's funny.
when I criticize you, you don't put on a big, goofy grin.
you really need to stop this.
given our history, shouldn't I be saying that to you?
Katherine, I can't just not speak to women.
I'm a gynecologist, for god's sake.
Yes, I know.
but you don't have to bring your work home with you.
you leaving already?
Ah, Edie asked me to help her pick out a gift for her sister, so I gotta swing by the mall.
when I see you next?
well, Victor has a teachers' union thing on Thursday.
guess I'll see you on Thursday.
Carlos, what's happening here?
I mean, with us. Why are we still sneaking around?
you know exactly why. - Oh, come on.
Edie's recovered from her little suicide attempt. Don't you think it's time to move on?
I've got some things going on, and I need them to pay off before I can make a move.
really, I don't have a choice.
okay, but if you did have a choice, would it be a hard one?
I mean, it's not like you're in love with Edie, is it?
no, I don't love Edie.
and I've got a plan to get her out of my life forever. Just give me two weeks, okay?
a bracelet's always nice.
for Edie's sister.
good idea.
here's the thing... my daughter has cancer.
she's so nauseous, she's stopped eating, and I can't just stand by and watch her waste away.
so I asked around, and people thought you might be able to get me what I need.
you follow my drift?
Um...yeah. You...you want me to score you some weed.
the best stuff you can get.
nothing's too good for my little girl.
darling?
what is it?
well, I don't want you to worry.
I-I just got off the phone with the convent.
it seems Danielle took a little spill.
you're 8 1/2 months pregnant!
what in heaven's name were you doing roller-blading?
I'm bored. All I do is lay around.
in your condition, that's what you should be doing.
and where on earth did you get skates in a convent?
I borrowed them from one of the eating disorder girls.
they have all the good exercise equipment.
Danielle, what if your reckless behavior had hurt the baby?
they're going to examine me. I'm sure the baby's fine.
Yes, and it is going to stay that way because I have instructed sister Theresa to keep you sequestered in your room until the baby is born.
what am I supposed to do for fun? You won't even get me a DVD player.
well, I was hoping that you could use these last few week for reflection and personal growth.
I hate you.
clearly, it would be time well spent.
how was the lasagna? - Why don't you ask it yourself?
honey. - Sorry.
at least eat a little. We need you in fighting form for charades tonight.
Yeah, about that... I don't think I'm gonna make it.
you have to! You are the charades assassin.
they still talk about the night that you guessed "the Americanization of Emily" in 15 seconds.
12. And that's my point.
I'm undefeated. Why spoil my winning streak by playing when I'm not up to it?
honey, people know that you're sick.
they don't expect you to be at your absolute best.
Tom, hair loss and constant nausea...those are inconveniences.
losing at charades to Susan Meyer that is just flat-out intolerable.
Hey, Andrew. - Hey.
what's up? Hey, Mr. Scavo, um, a package for Lynette's mom got delivered to our house by mistake, so...
I've got it, Tom. It's a pattern. I'm...knitting Lynette an Afghan.
a friend of mine recommended this place.
it's not exactly what I expected.
must be one heck of a doctor, though, huh?
I don't know. I just come here to buy clean urine.
Shoo! Those are only for grown-ups.
Why?
because that have special medicine in them.
like the grown-up iced tea you always drink?
similar.
how about some ice cream instead? And you can watch TV till your eyes fall out.
Yeah! - You stay.
grandma needs a favor, and you've got just the face for it.
wow, sweetie.
those really look delicious, but I just don't feel like eating right now.
just one, mom?
I made them special...Just for you.
this really is delicious.
emergency, you can reach me on my cell phone.
or they can just walk across the street.
have fun, girls. Don't do anything I would do.
Adam seems really laid-back.
Yeah, he's pretty cool.
of course, everyone seems cool compared to robot - mom.
Hey, you never told me.
what happened when you asked her about your real dad?
she freaked out, just like I thought.
she wouldn't tell me anything.
Well...There are other ways to find things out.
does your mom keep any old papers?
you know, letters, diaries?
not that she shows me.
there's stuff in the storage room upstairs, but it's locked, so forget about it.
what kind of lock is it?
Oh, come on in.
I was hoping you were Susan.
she's not here?
no, and she's not answering her cell phone.
where is she?
well, she had an appointment with this new obstetrician over on river street, but she should be here by now.
why would she see a doctor over there? That's a terrible neighborhood.
it is? - Yes.
don't you remember? That's where they murdered those two prostitutes last year.
we should help Mike with the food.
knock, knock. - we're here.
Oh, good! Katherine, I was hoping we'd get a chance to chat.
open this now.
Susan's parties are always such a snooze fest.
the only thing people will be miming is get me the hell out of here.
aren't you a little overdressed for charades?
Oh, I thought that I'd look nice, just in case we decided to...
Oh, I don't know-- announce our engagement?
we're not announcing anything.
it's Susan and Mike's party.
I do not want to make it all about us.
you're right, darling.
I may drop a few hints, though.
Edie, let me be clear on this.
you are not to tell anyone about our engagement, got it?
fine.
I won't say a word.
Oh, this is fantastic.
you know Edward Ferber?
state senator? - Yes.
his wife just got picked up for shoplifting.
why is that fantastic?
he was making noises about going against me for governor.
I guess the light-fingered Mrs.Ferber just put an end to that.
Why? It's not like he shoplifted.
it doesn't matter. It's a scandal.
you know what they do to poll numbers.
Oh, that's right.
I was reading about that in politics is boring magazine.
I'm just glad I don't have to worry about you pulling crap like that.
Yeah, you're lucky.
so where's Lynette?
she's usually your charades M.V.P.
Ah, she wasn't feeling so well, but, uh, you are still going down, mister.
it's just a game, Tom-- a game you wish you never played.
so much work...
Oh, hi, Gaby.
Katherine and I were just talking about the old days.
so when you were living with your aunt, was Dylan's father with you?
no, just me and Dylan.
were you widowed or divorced?
actually, I prefer not to discuss my first marriage...If you don't mind.
we, we certainly didn't mean to pry.
let me just tidge that up for you.
Hello, all.
Ah, it's so nice to see you.
some wine?
Oh, no.
Oh, my contact slipped.
Edie, is that an engagement ring?
uh, shoot.
pretend you didn't see that.
I promised my fiance?
that I wouldn't say a word until the official announcement.
excuse me.
sorry I'm late.
Oh, my God! You made it.
that is such a beautiful dress.
we're gonna have so much fun. You...Come with me.
she's got a ring! - What?
Edie -- she' s wearing a big, honkin' engagement ring the size of a peach pit.
Hey, I didn't get her a ring!
Oh, so you're not engaged?
well, see, here's the thing- - oh, you gotta be kidding me!
let me explain! - No, no, no.
I am done with your explanations, and I am done with just give me two more weeks, baby.
whatever games you're playing, I'm sick of it.
we're through.
so you're just gonna go and live happily ever after with Victor, huh?
you think Victor's my only option?
well, I got news for you, Carlos.
I can have any guy I want, because this...Waits for no man.
you bought yourself an engagement ring?
it's been three days, Carlos.
how long was I supposed to wait?
you agreed not to say anything.
Ah, but I didn't agree not to wear anything.
don't worry.
it wasn't expensive.
you can pay me back later.
count on it.
and the whole time, I just kept thinking, this is Bree's doctor.
Bree recommended him.
he must be the best.
so I didn't worry when it was between a needle exchange
and the area's only transvestite bookstore.
and I ignored that my shoes stuck to the floor
and there was a cigarette machine in the waiting room,
but when I saw the ant traps on his speculum tray, I thought that you and i should have a talk.
Oh, Susan, I am so sorry, and, of course, I will pay for the slashed tire and the stolen cell phone.
that is not the point!
why would you send me to somebody who is obviously not your doctor?
I can't tell you.
why not?
it's private.
you know what else is private?
the parts of me that I'm pretty sure he snapped with his camera phone.
I have a party to throw.
I will deal with you later.
look, Al, she is totally out of control.
I need her taken care of.
fine. I'll see what I can do.
I promised my fiance?
that I wouldn't say a word until the official announcement.
Adam, I feel the tag of my dress sticking out, and I can't reach it.
do you mind? - Oh, sure.
there you go.
I think I got a chill.
now let me see if I can give you one.
Oh, yeah, it worked.
we haven't been here an hour, and you're already humiliating me?
are we really having this conversation again?
Oh, I guess you learned nothing from Chicago.
for god sake, I was not flirting.
she asked me to fix her dress. - Yeah.
I saw your face.
I could tell what a chore it was for you.
you know what? I think I'm a little behind you in the alcohol department.
let me go catch up.
I'm sorry.
I, uh, didn't mean to eavesdrop, but you really shouldn't take this out on Adam.
Gabrielle has a little bit of a reputation, if you know what I mean.
no, I don't.
but I'd certainly like to.
okay, everybody, let the games begin.
um, okay. I will be team captain one.
who wants to be captain number two?
I'll do it. - Great.
okay, you pick first. - Oh, okay.
I will pick Adam.
I pick Lynette.
Where's Lynette?
uh, she really wanted to be here she's just feeling too sick to party.
that's funny, isn't it?
are you kidding? It's genius.
he's a sponge, but he talks!
well, looks like somebody is feeling a little better.
Yeah.
I guess that anti-nausea medicine finally kicked in.
that must be it.
husband in the room?
honey, I love you, but I wanna win.
you should pick Edie.
Why?
the woman just tried to commit suicide. Don't make her last pick.
she's still fragile. - Good point.
Yes! Let's get started.
no, no! Wait, wait, wait.
Gaby, you know how it works.
okay, first, I have to go over all the signals.
okay, so, um, this is movie, um, TV...
where did you learn to do this?
when you live with a mother who constantly locks herself out, you develop certain skills.
I don't know.
maybe this is a sign we should stop.
what were you saying about signs?
a whole concept, person, um, let's see.
Shakespeare, book, and then if you do the signal for book
and you touch your heart, then that's poem.
okay, when has anyone ever used a poem as a clue?
Yeah, come on. Let's play.
let's play!
Yeah! Let's play!
Hey, honey! You made it.
dibs on Lynette! She's on my team!
that's not fair. She's like the charades ninja.
that's me! The ninja!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
okay.
okay! I'm ready.
okay, go.
shoe. - Sock.
working out. -Black.
sole. - Itch.
itch. - Scratch.
a blister.
sounds like blister.
sister. - kissed her.
two Mules for Sister Sara!
okay, 22 seconds.
Lynette, you're up.
come on, babe.
we're 40 seconds down.
we need you to make that time up.
who do you think you're talking to?
right on. - All right.
ready?
get set...go. - Okay.
honey, clock's ticking.
I know.
just, this is a really hard one.
okay, come on, come on. What is--what is it?
is it a book? Is it a movie?
movie.
it's a western.
no talking. - Sorry.
honey, start with the first word.
how many syllables?
one word.
sweetie, act it out. You're really good at that.
okay, okay. Whole idea.
me. - Edie.
woman. - Blonde.
bleach!
hang 'Em High?
Yes! Yes!
Yes!
okay. Well, I think it's time for a break.
good idea. - Yeah.
you feeling okay? 'Cause you're...Acting kinda spacey.
Yeah, no, I'm good.
Hey, do you think they have any grapes or lobster?
Why--why don't I go get you some coffee, hon?
Hey, um, there's a phone call for you at the house. You should probably take it.
Hi. - Hello.
Oh, Tom.
Stella, what-- what are you doing here?
I made some brownies earlier, and I just...Noticed they were missing.
Lynette didn't bring them here, did she?
Why? Is that a problem?
it's like chocolate love.
okay, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
sorry, uh, don't eat those. Don't eat those. Sorry.
uh, no!
bad batch. Bad.
bad, bad, bad. Sorry.
full of trans fats.
Tom, watch it!
I am sorry.
Oh, here.
let me get that. - Thank you.
okay. - It's a little cold.
sorry. - It's all right.
would it be too much to ask you to keep your hands off my husband?
what? I spilled my drink on him.
and you're trying to make up for it by breast-feeding him?
look, lady, you need to calm down.
you're getting a reputation around here for having a stick up your ass.
better that reputation than the one you're toting around.
what do you mean by that?
okay, back to charades.
never mind. Forget it.
Oh, no, no. Tell me.
what's my reputation?
am I smug and holier-than-thou?
Oh, no, wait. That's you.
let me be specific.
by reputation, I mean that you are the kind of woman that treats a man like a play thing, whether it's my husband or let's say...Your teenage gardener?
Bree saw you slap your daughter.
excuse me?
Yeah, she asked about her father and then you smacked her.
why'd you do that?
this is the last thing that I will ever say to you.
Yes, I lost my temper with Dylan, but her father is a horrible man.
I want you to imagine the worst thing that a father can do to his daughter.
what was I supposed to tell Dylan about that, hmm?
I hope that satisfies everyone's curiosity.
Oh, my God.
"hang 'em high" has three syllables.
I guess you...saw what happened down there.
Yep.
look, it was a long time ago, and...and it didn't mean anything.
how many people know about this?
now or before tonight?
how many? - Look, I know you're upset.
I'm not upset. I'm just trying to work out how to spin this.
clearly, the boy was underage.
do you think money would shut him up?
Victor, really, I don't think it's a big deal.
hmm. That's because you're not me.
okay, you've got to remember this.
this is Bodsworth. You took him everywhere.
no, I think I'd remember a bear that ugly.
well, clearly, it's yours.
your mom kept it all these years, and he's here in your old room.
wait. This was my old room?
my mom told me I'm in my old room down the hall.
no, this was your room. What are you talking about?
evening, girls.
Hey. How was the party?
it was lovely.
I think your mother would like you home to help clean up.
I'm sorry, mom.
it's okay, sweetie.
but I don't want you seeing that girl anymore.
Orson, honey, where have you been?
we got a call from Danielle's doctor.
apparently, her fall caused a placental abruption, - where the placenta separates from the uterus. - Oh, my God.
now they said not to panic. There are degrees of this.
they're doing a sonogram, then they're gonna call us.
I can't wait that long. I have to be with her.
okay. I'll get your purse.
what do you think you're doing? You can't leave yet.
something's come up. We'll talk tomorrow. - No, we'll talk now.
you still owe me an explanation for that scuzzy gyno you sent me to.
I said I was sorry. For god sakes, Susan, not everything is about you.
Oh, I know this night has been a complete disaster, but all in all, it's still your best party ever.
I'm confused.
Ow! Now I'm confused, and my head hurts.
that's for letting Edie think you're engaged.
and the kiss?
when you saw me flirting, you smashed a glass.
when Victor heard I had an affair, he started crunching poll numbers.
I need a man who cares enough to explode when he thinks he's gonna lose me.
I don't just love you. I love the way you love me.
so we're back on? - See you Thursday.
al, what have you got for me?
I think I found a way to make this happen, but it might take a week or two to line everything up.
fantastic.
I'll call you when it's done.
can you make some copies of the Britt file?
al Kanminsky Certified Public Accountant ah seen Gaby?
uh, yeah, in the bathroom upstairs.
tell me something.
when you found out that kid who you were paying to mow your lawn was doing your wife, how did you not kill him?
well, I wanted to at first, but...Hey, we're all human, right? We gotta forgive and forget.
you're a very understanding man. If she pulled something like that on me, that guy wouldn't be around for long.
Yeah, but no woman's worth going to jail for, right?
if you have enough money, it's not that hard to make someone disappear.
let's go, honey.
night, Carlos.
darling, what are you doing? - I have to bring this DVD player to Danielle.
honey, we really have to go. - It'll just take a few seconds. These damn cords...
sweetheart, it's a long drive. - It's the only thing she asked for.
Yes. Hello?
Hello, doctor.
how is she?
thank God. - Oh, my God.
it's gonna be okay.
kids are all tucked in. They're sleeping like angels.
great. Did you put quaaludes in their cocoa?
could you check on 'em for me, please?
so how was the party? - You drugged me.
Oh. Just a little.
what is wrong with you? I told you, I didn't want any pot.
before you slap me around, let me ask you something.
do you feel better?
that's not the point. And what were you thinking, using my son as a drug mule?
he didn't know what was going on, and why are you making such a big deal about it?
let me ask you something. Do you remember what I wore to the junior prom or what part I had in the play that year?
who remembers that stuff?
my whole childhood passed in a blur because you were medicating yourself...pot when you were sick, booze when you weren't. I am not going to do that.
I wot miss a second of my kids' lives, not if I can avoid it.
well, I'd say I'm sorry, but I'm not.
you're a mom.
you know, there's nothing worse than watching your kids suffer, and seeing you act all goofy, watching that cartoon, well...it was probably the high point of my trip.
I get it.
but if you ever pull something like this again...
I won't. - Okay.
well...I think I'll turn in.
yenta. - What?
junior year, you were yenta in "Fiddler on the Roof."
you remembered. - Yeah.
there are some performances so bad, even alcohol can't block them out.
can we call a truce, please?
so you know I'm not bluffing, um, I brought cake.
I am so sorry that I snapped at you tonight.
it's okay.
I just wanna know what's going on.
ever since you've been pregnant, there's been this wall between us.
it's like something's changed, and I don't know why.
did I do something to offend you?
it's not about you. I've just been going through some things.
like what? I mean, come on. Just tell me.
we share everything.
okay. Um...I haven't told anybody this, but...it's, uh, about the baby.
there have been some complications. - Oh, no.
is everything okay? - Yeah, everything's fine, but, uh, there was just a time where I thought I might lose it.
Oh, my God.
and there I was, just bugging you about your doctor. I am sorry.
you should've just told me. -No, you're pregnant, too.
I'm not gonna tell you anything that's gonna worry you.
Oh, are you kidding? It's the first baby I've had in 17 years.
you know, I could not possibly be more freaked out.
this morning, I caught Mike building a crib. - No.
this early? - Yeah!
I-I wanted to scream. You know, are you nuts? Do you just wanna jinx it?
this is what we get for having kids at our age... anxiety, terror.
it's just gonna get worse.
do you know, when our babies go to college, we'll be like...dead?
if we are lucky - Mm.
look at us.
pregnant gals, eating cake and bitchin'.
it's kinda nice, huh? - It really is.
what are you doing? - The hospital called.
my aunt's ready to come home.
and you want her to stay in here? - Yeah.
I think making this room off-limits was a mistake.
if I want Dylan to focus on other things, I really need to make it less intriguing.
speaking of intriguing, what were you thinking last night?
what? - Come on.
"the worst thing a father could do?" You realize what people are gonna think.
Yeah.
they're gonna be very uncomfortable, and uncomfortable people don't ask questions.
all children love games.
but children grow up, and then they find new games to play.
they pretend to be well so their families won't worry.
they lie to their lovers about where they go in the afternoon.
so anyway, that's why it was so great.
Oh! - They invent stories to hide - the truth from their friends. - I got it, I got it.
Oh, one more. Here you go.
Yes. Everyone has fun playing games right up until the moment someone gets hurt.
when her first husband died, Bree thought she was rid of her mother-in-law.
Danielle got pregnant, and Bree got creative.
soon this whole charade will completely unravel, and we will be humiliated.
Carlos and Gaby's affair turned dangerous...
if she pulled something like that on me, that guy wouldn't be around for long.
and an old neighbor returned.
I didn't want poor aunt Lily to spend her final days in a nursing home.
that is so kind of you.
Mrs. Lillian Sims returned to Wisteria Lane on a Saturday.
as she emerged from the ambulance, it occurred to her the neighborhood looked exactly as she had left it.
she then decided she should have painted her house blue.
moments later, she wondered if she would see her husband in heaven.
these are just some of the thoughts that go through an old woman's mind when she comes home to die.
now if you need anything, you just ring this little bell, and I'll come running.
I'm sorry to be so much trouble.
well, the good news is, I-I won't be a burden much longer.
Oh, don't say that.
the doctors say there's a good chance at you'll be with us for a very long time.
I know what's happening to me, Katherine.
you don't need to lie.
aunt lily...
what does it feel like?
dying, I mean.
it's not that bad.
I feel lucky.
when you know time is running out, you--you get a chance to reflect on your life.
I-I really did try to live a good one.
you did more than try.
God is going to welcome you with open arms.
I'm not so sure.
Oh, why would you say that?
I keep thinking about Dylan...
what we did, what we covered up.
we did what we had to.
we should have told someone.
we couldn't. You know that.
it--it was a mistake, and it's not too late to rectify it.
your life may be over, but that does not give you the right to go around destroying the lives of others.
I can't go to my grave with this on my conscience. Please!
we have to tell that girl what happened in this room.
absolutely not.
as her guilt over the past began to mount, it occurred to Lillian death couldn't come quickly enough.
this thought occurred to her niece as well.
there were a lot of things Bob Hunter disliked about living in the city, and the thing he hated most were the pests.
the rats that lurked in the alleys...
the flies that swarmed the garge...
the bugs that invaded his co-op.
I have tried it your way...
finally, Bob informed his significant other it was time...to leave the city.
so they moved to suburbia, which they quickly discovered had a few pests...
Hey, neighbor!
of its own.
Oh, we haven't gotten a chance to meet.
I'm Susan. I live next door.
Oh! Jeez.
Hi. Hi, I'm Lee.
uh, I-I just wanted to say hi.
you know, I saw the movers taking in some of your furniture, and I just have to say you and your wife have gorgeous taste.
need some help?
Yeah, like you wouldn't believe.
um, I'm Susan. I live next door.
Oh, hi. I'm Lee's partner Bob.
Oh, you're partners.
what kind of business?
you know, whatever it is, just don't let the neighborhood association hear that you work out of your house.
they're so not cool.
actually, we're life partners.
Oh. Oh! oh, that's super!
Yeah, I've seen a lot of cable, so I get it.
you're just great.
thank you.
I-I hope we can live up to your stereotype.
don't mind him.
he's just a little cranky from, uh, all the fresh air.
do not apologize for me.
Lee, you're the one who said moving here would be better for Raphael.
so there's, uh... there's three of you.
well, that must be... cozy.
Yes. We're gay mormons.
Susan, uh...
that's Raphael.
Raphael is your dog, of course.
you know, 'cause you folks can't have kids.
I mean, uh, I mean, of course you can have kids, um, you--you know, because times have changed, and now you're allowed.
what a... nice dog.
I should go.
nice to meet you.
Hey, stop by any time, Susan
what are you doing? - What are you doing?
yes? - I have a delivery for Danielle Van De Kamp.
can I get you to sign here, please?
is that for us?
no, it's for Danielle.
there you are. Thank you.
that's odd. Who would send her a scooter?
I knew it!
Phyllis Rex's mother.
ever since he died, she's been trying to buy children's affection.
well, it's a honey of a bike.
I'm sure Danielle will appreciate the thought.
well, I'm nogiving it to her.
can you think of a worse present for a pregnant girl?
well, I'm not knocked up.
let me have it.
you know how I feel about 2-wheeled motorized vehicles.
they're too dangerous.
we'll donate it to the church.
What?!
Reverend Sikes said they're looking for items for the raffle.
so we're just gonna give it away?
well, it's better than you breaking your neck on it.
mom, you know how much I want a scooter.
come on.
you heard your mother.
we're donating it to the church.
of course we need to make sure it's in good working order before we do that.
not without a helmet.
this blows.
are we gonna let her do this to us?
absolutely not.
if we win that raffle, we're keeping it.
Hey.
it is nice to hear you humming again.
well, it's amazing what a week without chemo can do.
Yeah.
when does the last round start?
next month, so I have some time before I start feeling like total crap again.
and I was hoping we could put that time to good use.
are you sure?
I mean, the doctor said it could be months before you get your mojo back.
well, it's back.
and since when do you question the mojo?
you're right.
you're right. Forgive me.
okay, so here are your options.
"a," we could go romantic, play soft music, light some candles, or "B," go straight to the...
God, it's so been soong.
I hope I remember how to do this.
well, it's just like riding a bike. You never forget.
now start pedaling.
Hey.
Hey. What are you doing?
Ooh, sorry. I just messed up your hair.
I'm just trying to fix it.
sorry. Al-almost got it.
Hey!
Hey.
screw it.
What--what are you doing?
Oh, I ripped it this morning.
it's been itching the hell out of me...
and this is much better.
are you sure you wanna take that off, honey?
I mean, won't you be cold?
no, I'm good.
Hey, babe, what's going on?
you still with me?
Yeah.
it's just-- it's kinda...
what?
late.
it's 9: 30.
it's just that one of our ovens broke down today, and the repairman's coming first thing in the morning, maybe I could ravish you...tomorrow.
Oh, okay.
come on, Bree. You have to let us do this.
uh, it's a lovely thought, but I really don't want a baby shower.
well, I bought you an expensive gift, and I'm not giving it to you unless there's a party with people who can see how generous I am.
Bree, watch this!
Orson, I said be careful!
I just think it's tacky to have a baby shower when it's not your first baby.
well, I don't see the problem with it...
hint, hint.
Yeah, and showers aren't just about presents. They're fun.
and we can play games, like "how big is mummy's tummy?"
excuse me?
Yeah, we get a ball of yarn, and we each cut a piece that we think is just big enough to fit around your stomach, and the one closest wins a prize.
I really don't want a shower. Look at me!
look!
Orson, just five more minutes! That's all you're getting!
I tell you what. Why don't we just skip the shower, and after the baby's born, I'll have a christening party?
what do you say?
I'm okay!
I'm fine.
Oh, dear god.
excuse me, ladies. I
I couldn't help overhearing you-you talking about my mom's shower.
I-I think I could be of a little assistance here.
why do you have to te our new neighbors cookie bars?
Oh, look, I made a terrible first impression, so I thought I'd make them some of my home-baked goodness.
but you didn't bake any goodness.
you just warmed up the goodness I bought at the store.
well, yeah. I don't bake. Catch up.
you know, not all neighbors have to be friends.
why don't you just let it go?
Mike, they live 15 feet from us.
if we have a fire, I wanna be sure that they like us enough to call 9-1-1.
Ah, that's the real reason.
you can't stand it when somebody doesn't like you.
well, maybe.
maybe Bob and Lee just like to keep to themselves.
that's fine, and once they like me, they can keep to themselves all they damn well please.
Hi. I wanted to bring you a "welcome to the neighborhood" present.
you should try one while they're still warm from the oven.
that was really nice. Thank you.
Oh, are there nuts in them?
nuts? - Yeah.
gee, let me think.
Nope, no nuts. - Are you sure?
cause I'm highly allergic. Half a pecan could kill me.
I'm not seeing any nuts. - Okay, you made them, so did you or did you not put nuts in them?
okay, here's the thing.
I'm a really crappy baker.
to give you something that I made myself would be like an insult, so-so... - So-so you bought them, and...
and then you heated them up in attempt to make your gesture seem more thoughtful than, in fact, it was.
Hey, I would've made them myself if I knew how.
honestly, I'm a good neighbor.
Yeah, well, neighbor, why don't you take your store-bought, warmed-up, possibly poisonous cookie bars and give them to someone more likely to survive your generosity?
do you like wine?
no, no, so please don't bring me a bottle from your vineyard.
this rip is pretty big.
it'll take about a week.
a week?
all right.
you'll hurry if you can?
honey, it's okay. You look cute in a scarf.
I'm upset 'cause that salesgirl just walked away with my sex life.
what?
after two months of puking my guts out, last night I was finally in the mood, but Tom--not so much.
apparently, my bald head is a big turnoff for him.
why'd you take your wig off? - It was itchy.
okay, not smart.
Gaby, I am his wife.
he's supposed to love me not my body, me...
my--my soul. Why can't he make love to my soul?
interesting.
question
when was the last time you were in the bar and heard a guy turn to his friend and say, "hey, check out the soul on that girl"?
what are you saying?
I'm saying men are visual.
hell, I have a whole closet full of costumes.
you need to give Tom something to look at, something spicy, like...
Gaby, I'm not a redhead.
but you could be, which brings me to my second point.
men like variety.
tonight you're a redhead.
tomorrow...
you are...Helga, the sexy milkmaid.
or...
amber, the lonely runaway.
or...
Jeff, the friendly guy from work.
what? I don't know what Tom is into.
hmm.
Claude, you know I don't like it when you "hmm."
Edie...how long have you had this?
had what? I don't have anything.
I'm just here for my 5, 000-mile checkup.
well, you know that bullet you've managed to dodge all these years?
which one? The clap?
the herp?
the syph?!
crabs? - Relax.
I'll boil all the sheets and towels, and then we'll use this special shampoo, and in three days, the crotch carnival packs up and leaves town.
Oh, man.
how did this happen? - Don't give me that looK.
I know exactly how I got 'em.
I used the tanning bed right after mimsy Porter, that skank.
EW, it smells like burnt licorice.
well, come in the bathroom, and I'll show you how to use this.
I think I can figure that out.
you know, the good news is we're in a committed relationship.
otherwise, we'd have to make that call of shame to everyone we've been with.
you've heard me make before, but something I feel very, very strongly about.
for me, it's a very simple formula.
more development leads to an increased tax base, which helps build schools for our children.
around the country, the needs of children are being...
what are you doing here? - I need to talk to you.
can't you just call me?
this is not something that you wanna hear on the phone.
and not follow this trend.
and we will put education where it belongs-- at the top of the list.
EW! How did you get those?
how do you think? Edie.
you are still sleeping with Edie?
well, you're still sleeping with Victor, aren't you?
Yeah, if I didn't, he would think something is going on.
what is your excuse for doing it with Edie?
she wants to, and I'm a guy.
Ow! - This is serious, okay?
if Victor wakes up with a zoo in his pants, - there's gonna be hell to pay. - You don't have to tell me.
if he finds out about us, I'm the one that's gonna wind up in a landfill.
okay, just don't panic, okay?
we're gonna get the salve or the ointment or whatever it is you put down there, and we're gonna be fine.
we're screwed. - Yeah.
Tom? The kids are asleep.
are you coming to bed anytime soon?
Yeah, I just gotta pick a new running back for my fantasy football team.
that's too bad.
I had a little fantasy thing planned of my own.
whoa.
Lynette's not here right now.
I'm Brandy, the slutty cheerleader.
this is all very romantic, Gaby, but I still have four building proposals to read before tomorrow.
that's nurse Gaby to you.
nurse Gaby?
am I sick?
well, the doctor says you need to relax, and i know just how to relax you.
it smells like licorice.
it's a blend of 36 essential oils, anise root and fennel.
do you like it?
it smells a little medicine.
that's the fennel.
it's stinging a little.
that's the tension...leaving your body.
it's really stinging.
and we can rinse it off...in three to five minutes.
but before we do that...
what the hell is that?
you know, for a guy getting rubbed down by a hot nurse, - you ask a lot of questions. - Sorry.
Oh, come on, uncle Frank.
what's the point of having a gay uncle if youe not gonna help me make friends with these guys?
Oh.
uh, mom said that the whole family knew.
um, okay. Gotta go. Love you.
what's going on?
Oh, I found Raphael wandering in the street.
I went to take him back, but Bob and Lee aren't home, so I'm just gonna give him a little treat and put him back in their yard.
wait a second. - What?
leave him with me. I need to score some points with those guys, and being a dog-rescuing hero could be just the ticket.
so what, you're just gonna keep him here until they come back?
Uh-huh.
maybe a little longer.
how long?
well, long enough for them to worry.
you know, the more they worry, the more I'm a hero. Get it?
I get that you're insane. - I'm not, I'm not.
now get some mud. I wanna dirty him up so he looks like he's been through hell.
okay, in you go.
here, let me help you with those.
Oh, that's all right. I've got them, Mr. Knievel.
Oh, boy.
you're nevegonna let me live this down, are you?
Nope.
I thought the same thing. - It seems to me that you should go to the doctor again.
surprise!
uh, guys...
what did I tell you? - You said "no shower."
but look around--men.
so technically, it's a party, not a shower.
andrew told us that you only said no...
cause you didn't want to impose.
Oh!
so you're responsible?
Yeah, well, I-I know you said not to make a big fuss, but, hey, you earned it.
well, don't just stand there. Come in.
we have lots of food and fun and surprises.
Yeah, all kinds of surprises.
where is she?
I, uh, helped with the invitations, too.
I can't tell you how touched I was to be included, especially after my many conciliatory gesture were so coldly rebuffed.
I have been awful.
I wouldn't blame you if you stormed out right now.
non sense.
I'm here to celebrate our renewed friendship...
and your baby.
or should I say babies?
you know, it's often a sign of twins when a mother's face gets all plump like yours.
Oh, um...
I, uh, bet you wouldn't mind if I broke my neck on that scooter now.
I'm off to the bank.
aunt Lily just took a pill, so she's down for the afternoon.
okay. Have fun.
is your mother gone? - Yeah. Do you need her?
no, no.
this is what I wanted.
I thought you took a sleeping pill.
I pretended to so she'd leave us alone.
aunt Lily, what's going on?
I have to tell you something.
first, you should know that what happened...
it was nobody's fault.
what do you mean, "what happened"?
you don't remember living on this street before, do you?
no.
well...
there's a reason for that.
mom, I thought you left.
I forgot my checkbook.
could you go down and find it for me? - Sure.
you really should get your rest.
Hey.
Hi. - Hi.
got your wig back, huh? - Yeah.
good as new.
listen, I thought we could put the kids to bed early tonight, if you know what I mean.
I do, and I'm up for that.
fantastic.
I hope Brandy won't get stuck late at cheerleading practice.
Oh, about brandy...bad news.
what? What--what happened?
well, Penny wanted to play beauty school with the wig, and, well, let's just say she's got no future as a stylist.
bad haircut, huh? - Oh.
sounds like Brandy might get awful mad about that.
Brandy's history, Tom. Let her go.
come home, boy!
is something wrong? - Raphael got out.
I-I don't know what happened. I think he jumped the fence.
Oh.
well, would you like me to help you look for him?
Seriously?
what a--what about your party? - Oh.
it's just a baby shower...
that I'm throwing... for my best friend.
I can't--I can't ask you to leave that. - That's-- oh, please.
what are neighbors for?
here, puppy!
I see you've taken down all the pictures of Rex.
well, I'm, uh, sorry if that offends you, Phyllis, but I didn't want Orson to feel uncomfortable in his new home.
I see.
you're trying to be considerate of your husband's feelings.
well, I'm glad that you're at least trying to get it right the second time around.
still, it must be awfully hard on Danielle and Andrew to have their father's face banished from their own home.
he wasn't banished.
by the way...
Where--where's Danielle?
she's, uh, at boarding school...in Switzerland.
Switzerland?!
is it asking too much to be told what continent my granddaughter is on?!
you are keeping my grandchildren from me, and I don't know why.
I'm going to mingle.
every time I start a chat, you walk away.
I mean, if you don't want to talk to me, why did you invite me?
it's a surprise party, you daft woman!
what makes you think I had a hand in the guest list?
so...
you don't want me here?
Oh, for god sakes, Phyllis, it's not as if we got along when Rex was alive.
what did I ever do to you but try to treat you like a daughter?
I even gave you my mother's sable coat.
you hated your mother. - But I loved that coat.
then I'll give it back to you.
no, you keep it as a reminder of howard I tried to make you like me.
grandma, are you leaving already?
I'm sorry, dear, but your mother has made it impossible for me to stay.
where does she keep my sable coat?
probably in her bedroom closet.
where is she going?
she asked me where your fur coat was.
and--and you told her?!
Oh, crap.
I guess you won't be needing the breast pump I bought you.
so... Danielle is having a baby.
Yes, and for the sake of her reputation, we've agreed to pretend that it's mine.
I just hope that those Swiss doctors know what they're doing.
she's not in Switzerland.
she's at the sisters of hope convent.
look, Phyllis, I'm sorry. I know this is upsetting.
actually, I'm thrilled.
I'm going to be a great-grandma.
well, um...
technically, yes.
what do you mean, "technically"?
we're saying that the baby is mine and Orson's, and if you hover around like a grandmother, people will be suspicious.
you're not keeping this baby from me, not if you don't want me to tell those people downstairs - whose child it really is. - You wouldn't.
think of Danielle!
I wish you had.
if you'd rsed her properly, she wouldn't be pregnant without a husband.
you think I don't know I'm a failure as a parent?
that's why this child means so much to me.
it's my second chance.
well, I hope the second time around that you take my advice.
I always said that you were too strict with those kids.
parenting tips from you? That's rich.
I was a wonderful mother to Rex.
then why did he always avoid you?
why were you barely ever here?
because of you!
he knew you hated me.
Oh, heas happy to let you think that, but he was the one who dreaded your visits.
Oh.
Phyllis, wait!
excuse me, everyone, but I have something to say.
What--what is it, grandma?
I have to go.
like just one how have so much time
goodbye thank you for the gift.
you know, Bree, you're not the only one who would like a second chance.
nothing, huh? - No.
no, he's lost.
and he doesn't know this neighborhood.
there's no way he's gonna find his way home.
Oh, he will. Come on. You gotta keep believing.
Oh, crap!
Bob's home. What am I gonna tell him?
don't. We'll just keep looking.
I have a feeling we're gonna find that cute little guy.
you--you are so nice to do this,
I mean, especially after the way I acted when we first...
you know what? Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna go inside and get us some water, - and then we're gonna just keep looking. - Okay.
I can't find Raphael. You seen him anywhere?
Oh, Bob, prom--promise you won't hate me.
what are you talking about? What happened?
Raphael got out.
he got out? - Yeah.
he doesn't know the neighborhood.
I know he doesn't know the neighborhood. - What are you talking about?
how are you looking for him?
Oh, wait, he's right there.
Hey, hey.
Oh! Hey! Hey!
Oh! Oh, my god!
what was our dog doing in your garage?
I have no idea.
what?
did you get a chance to, uh, napalm the jungle yet?
Yep.
And?
all quiet on the southern front.
Gaby, we have got to be more careful.
Absolutely.
it's kind of exciting, though.
what is?
playing with fire, almost getting burned but not quite.
don't be thinking like that.
if Victor catches us, he'll kill us both.
that's what's so exciting.
Hi.
Hi. - Oh, my--excuse me.
Mmm, that's, um...
an interesting cologne you're wearing.
my wife gave it to me. It's got, uh, anise root, fennel.
what, you like it?
Yeah, it's just, um...
I don't know...
weirdly familiar.
crab cake?
uh, yeah.
Thanks.
crab cake?
crab cake?
crab cake?
kids are asleep.
I'm not.
what got back there? - Just a little present.
say hello to Brandy's even sluttier sister...
what are you doing?
well, I just--I just thought since we had so much fun last night, maybe we can have a little more fun.
and that's only possible when you're pretending I'm someone else?
well, you have to pretend, too.
what?
this...
is me, Tom, not Brandy or Candy.
it's just your wife, lynette.
am I not enough for you?
what are you getting so mad for?
the first wig was your idea.
Yeah, because I'm bald.
and I know that that's a big old turnoff, but, you know, I can't help it.
I have cancer. - Yes, I know.
I hear about it all the time.
can you blame me for wanting to escape every once in a while?
escape from me, you mean? - Yes!
you know why last night was so much fun?
because I got to make love to someone who wasn't sick.
look, I know, I know, I'm not supposed to say this stuff.
I have to be the heroic husband who listens and holds you when you cry and never cries himself.
but this affects me, too.
well... I know that.
you do? - Yeah.
how?
since this whole thing began, have you ever once asked me how I'm doing?
Oh...
my god. I haven't, have I?
I am one of those...whiny, self-involved sick people.
I didn't say that. - No, I am.
it's been months, and I have barely thought about what you're going through.
it's okay.
you're going through something - will you stop being so heroic?!
I'm a cancer bitch!
what?
I'm not gonna argue with you.
you suck.
well...
I guess I could give Candy a whirl.
are the kids really asleep?
cause I think she might be a screamer.
actually, if wre gonna pretend...
how about tonight I'm not a hero and you are not a cancer patient?
we'll just be Tom and Lynette, see what happens.
Oh, I'd like that.
how's Bob's suit?
ruined. - Oh.
what if we take it to my cleaners? - Susan, that paint's not coming out...
so we're buying him a new suit...for 2, 000 bucks.
$2, 000?
well, according to Lee, it's a Dolce.
I don't know what that means, but he said it six times.
that's crazy.
no, what's crazy is I'm about to buy the most expensive suit of my life, - and I'll never wear it. - Oh.
I just wanted them to like me. - Well, they don't.
lee said that six times, too.
there must be some way I can apologize to them.
we can't afford any more of your apologies.
I know. Uh, maybe if I.
damn it, Susan, let it go, okay?
I asked you to before, and you didn't, and look what happened.
so I'll ask you again. Just let it go.
Mike, wait. We should talk about this.
I'm going to bed.
I've gotta work tomorrow.
I'm buying a suit.
grandma!
what are you doing here?
you needn't be embarrassed, dear.
your mother's told me everything.
it's great to see you.
I hate this place. It's like baby jail.
well, that's what I've come to talk to you about.
perhaps it's time for you to leave.
is that you? We have--have to talk.
Hey.
I'm glad you're home.
I wanted to talk to you about aunt Lily.
what about her?
it was so weird.
she called me into her room this afternoon.
she started saying she knew why I didn't remember living on this street before.
Oh, sweetie.
your aunt Lily is fading fast.
half the time, she doesn't know what she's saying.
was that her?
no, I just checked on her. She's sleeping.
you know, you have that recital in two weeks.
shouldn't you be practicing?
please!
pests, they come in all shapes and sizes and disrupt our lives in a variety of ways.
at first, they're merely annoying, and we do our best to ignore them.
but if we don't take them seriously, they can become quite dangerous.
for some, death seems to be the easiest solution.
but the problem with pests is that what they leave behind...is just as dangerous.
when her first husband died, Bree thought she was rid of her mother-in-law.
Danielle got pregnant, and Bree got creative.
soon this whole charade will completely unravel, and we will be humiliated.
Carlos and Gaby's affair turned dangerous...
if she pulled something like that on me, that guy wouldn't be around for long.
and an old neighbor returned.
I didn't want poor aunt Lily to spend her final days in a nursing home.
that is so kind of you.
Mrs. Lillian Sims returned to Wisteria Lane on a Saturday.
as she emerged from the ambulance, it occurred to her the neighborhood looked exactly as she had left it.
she then decided she should have painted her house blue.
moments later, she wondered if she would see her husband in heaven.
these are just some of the thoughts that go through an old woman's mind when she comes home to die.
now if you need anything, you just ring this little bell, and I'll come running.
I'm sorry to be so much trouble.
well, the good news is, I-I won't be a burden much longer.
Oh, don't say that.
the doctors say there's a good chance at you'll be with us for a very long time.
I know what's happening to me, Katherine.
you don't need to lie.
aunt lily...
what does it feel like?
dying, I mean.
it's not that bad.
I feel lucky.
when you know time is running out, you--you get a chance to reflect on your life.
I-I really did try to live a good one.
you did more than try.
God is going to welcome you with open arms.
I'm not so sure.
Oh, why would you say that?
I keep thinking about Dylan...
what we did, what we covered up.
we did what we had to.
we should have told someone.
we couldn't. You know that.
it--it was a mistake, and it's not too late to rectify it.
your life may be over, but that does not give you the right to go around destroying the lives of others.
I can't go to my grave with this on my conscience. Please!
we have to tell that girl what happened in this room.
absolutely not.
as her guilt over the past began to mount, it occurred to Lillian death couldn't come quickly enough.
this thought occurred to her niece as well.
there were a lot of things Bob Hunter disliked about living in the city, and the thing he hated most were the pests.
the rats that lurked in the alleys...
the flies that swarmed the garge...
the bugs that invaded his co-op.
I have tried it your way...
finally, Bob informed his significant other it was time...to leave the city.
so they moved to suburbia, which they quickly discovered had a few pests...
Hey, neighbor!
of its own.
Oh, we haven't gotten a chance to meet.
I'm Susan. I live next door.
Oh! Jeez.
Hi. Hi, I'm Lee.
uh, I-I just wanted to say hi.
you know, I saw the movers taking in some of your furniture, and I just have to say you and your wife have gorgeous taste.
need some help?
Yeah, like you wouldn't believe.
um, I'm Susan. I live next door.
Oh, hi. I'm Lee's partner Bob.
Oh, you're partners.
what kind of business?
you know, whatever it is, just don't let the neighborhood association hear that you work out of your house.
they're so not cool.
actually, we're life partners.
Oh. Oh! oh, that's super!
Yeah, I've seen a lot of cable, so I get it.
you're just great.
thank you.
I-I hope we can live up to your stereotype.
don't mind him.
he's just a little cranky from, uh, all the fresh air.
do not apologize for me.
Lee, you're the one who said moving here would be better for Raphael.
so there's, uh... there's three of you.
well, that must be... cozy.
Yes. We're gay mormons.
Susan, uh...
that's Raphael.
Raphael is your dog, of course.
you know, 'cause you folks can't have kids.
I mean, uh, I mean, of course you can have kids, um, you--you know, because times have changed, and now you're allowed.
what a... nice dog.
I should go.
nice to meet you.
Hey, stop by any time, Susan
what are you doing? - What are you doing?
yes? - I have a delivery for Danielle Van De Kamp.
can I get you to sign here, please?
is that for us?
no, it's for Danielle.
there you are. Thank you.
that's odd. Who would send her a scooter?
I knew it!
Phyllis Rex's mother.
ever since he died, she's been trying to buy children's affection.
well, it's a honey of a bike.
I'm sure Danielle will appreciate the thought.
well, I'm nogiving it to her.
can you think of a worse present for a pregnant girl?
well, I'm not knocked up.
let me have it.
you know how I feel about 2-wheeled motorized vehicles.
they're too dangerous.
we'll donate it to the church.
What?!
Reverend Sikes said they're looking for items for the raffle.
so we're just gonna give it away?
well, it's better than you breaking your neck on it.
mom, you know how much I want a scooter.
come on.
you heard your mother.
we're donating it to the church.
of course we need to make sure it's in good working order before we do that.
not without a helmet.
this blows.
are we gonna let her do this to us?
absolutely not.
if we win that raffle, we're keeping it.
Hey.
it is nice to hear you humming again.
well, it's amazing what a week without chemo can do.
Yeah.
when does the last round start?
next month, so I have some time before I start feeling like total crap again.
and I was hoping we could put that time to good use.
are you sure?
I mean, the doctor said it could be months before you get your mojo back.
well, it's back.
and since when do you question the mojo?
you're right.
you're right. Forgive me.
okay, so here are your options.
"a," we could go romantic, play soft music, light some candles, or "B," go straight to the...
God, it's so been soong.
I hope I remember how to do this.
well, it's just like riding a bike. You never forget.
now start pedaling.
Hey.
Hey. What are you doing?
Ooh, sorry. I just messed up your hair.
I'm just trying to fix it.
sorry. Al-almost got it.
Hey!
Hey.
screw it.
What--what are you doing?
Oh, I ripped it this morning.
it's been itching the hell out of me...
and this is much better.
are you sure you wanna take that off, honey?
I mean, won't you be cold?
no, I'm good.
Hey, babe, what's going on?
you still with me?
Yeah.
it's just-- it's kinda...
what?
late.
it's 9: 30.
it's just that one of our ovens broke down today, and the repairman's coming first thing in the morning, maybe I could ravish you...tomorrow.
Oh, okay.
come on, Bree. You have to let us do this.
uh, it's a lovely thought, but I really don't want a baby shower.
well, I bought you an expensive gift, and I'm not giving it to you unless there's a party with people who can see how generous I am.
Bree, watch this!
Orson, I said be careful!
I just think it's tacky to have a baby shower when it's not your first baby.
well, I don't see the problem with it...
hint, hint.
Yeah, and showers aren't just about presents. They're fun.
and we can play games, like "how big is mummy's tummy?"
excuse me?
Yeah, we get a ball of yarn, and we each cut a piece that we think is just big enough to fit around your stomach, and the one closest wins a prize.
I really don't want a shower. Look at me!
look!
Orson, just five more minutes! That's all you're getting!
I tell you what. Why don't we just skip the shower, and after the baby's born, I'll have a christening party?
what do you say?
I'm okay!
I'm fine.
Oh, dear god.
excuse me, ladies. I
I couldn't help overhearing you-you talking about my mom's shower.
I-I think I could be of a little assistance here.
why do you have to te our new neighbors cookie bars?
Oh, look, I made a terrible first impression, so I thought I'd make them some of my home-baked goodness.
but you didn't bake any goodness.
you just warmed up the goodness I bought at the store.
well, yeah. I don't bake. Catch up.
you know, not all neighbors have to be friends.
why don't you just let it go?
Mike, they live 15 feet from us.
if we have a fire, I wanna be sure that they like us enough to call 9-1-1.
Ah, that's the real reason.
you can't stand it when somebody doesn't like you.
well, maybe.
maybe Bob and Lee just like to keep to themselves.
that's fine, and once they like me, they can keep to themselves all they damn well please.
Hi. I wanted to bring you a "welcome to the neighborhood" present.
you should try one while they're still warm from the oven.
that was really nice. Thank you.
Oh, are there nuts in them?
nuts? - Yeah.
gee, let me think.
Nope, no nuts. - Are you sure?
cause I'm highly allergic. Half a pecan could kill me.
I'm not seeing any nuts. - Okay, you made them, so did you or did you not put nuts in them?
okay, here's the thing.
I'm a really crappy baker.
to give you something that I made myself would be like an insult, so-so... - So-so you bought them, and...
and then you heated them up in attempt to make your gesture seem more thoughtful than, in fact, it was.
Hey, I would've made them myself if I knew how.
honestly, I'm a good neighbor.
Yeah, well, neighbor, why don't you take your store-bought, warmed-up, possibly poisonous cookie bars and give them to someone more likely to survive your generosity?
do you like wine?
no, no, so please don't bring me a bottle from your vineyard.
this rip is pretty big.
it'll take about a week.
a week?
all right.
you'll hurry if you can?
honey, it's okay. You look cute in a scarf.
I'm upset 'cause that salesgirl just walked away with my sex life.
what?
after two months of puking my guts out, last night I was finally in the mood, but Tom--not so much.
apparently, my bald head is a big turnoff for him.
why'd you take your wig off? - It was itchy.
okay, not smart.
Gaby, I am his wife.
he's supposed to love me not my body, me...
my--my soul. Why can't he make love to my soul?
interesting.
question
when was the last time you were in the bar and heard a guy turn to his friend and say, "hey, check out the soul on that girl"?
what are you saying?
I'm saying men are visual.
hell, I have a whole closet full of costumes.
you need to give Tom something to look at, something spicy, like...
Gaby, I'm not a redhead.
but you could be, which brings me to my second point.
men like variety.
tonight you're a redhead.
tomorrow...
you are...Helga, the sexy milkmaid.
or...
amber, the lonely runaway.
or...
Jeff, the friendly guy from work.
what? I don't know what Tom is into.
hmm.
Claude, you know I don't like it when you "hmm."
Edie...how long have you had this?
had what? I don't have anything.
I'm just here for my 5, 000-mile checkup.
well, you know that bullet you've managed to dodge all these years?
which one? The clap?
the herp?
the syph?!
crabs? - Relax.
I'll boil all the sheets and towels, and then we'll use this special shampoo, and in three days, the crotch carnival packs up and leaves town.
Oh, man.
how did this happen? - Don't give me that looK.
I know exactly how I got 'em.
I used the tanning bed right after mimsy Porter, that skank.
EW, it smells like burnt licorice.
well, come in the bathroom, and I'll show you how to use this.
I think I can figure that out.
you know, the good news is we're in a committed relationship.
otherwise, we'd have to make that call of shame to everyone we've been with.
you've heard me make before, but something I feel very, very strongly about.
for me, it's a very simple formula.
more development leads to an increased tax base, which helps build schools for our children.
around the country, the needs of children are being...
what are you doing here? - I need to talk to you.
can't you just call me?
this is not something that you wanna hear on the phone.
and not follow this trend.
and we will put education where it belongs-- at the top of the list.
EW! How did you get those?
how do you think? Edie.
you are still sleeping with Edie?
well, you're still sleeping with Victor, aren't you?
Yeah, if I didn't, he would think something is going on.
what is your excuse for doing it with Edie?
she wants to, and I'm a guy.
Ow! - This is serious, okay?
if Victor wakes up with a zoo in his pants, - there's gonna be hell to pay. - You don't have to tell me.
if he finds out about us, I'm the one that's gonna wind up in a landfill.
okay, just don't panic, okay?
we're gonna get the salve or the ointment or whatever it is you put down there, and we're gonna be fine.
we're screwed. - Yeah.
Tom? The kids are asleep.
are you coming to bed anytime soon?
Yeah, I just gotta pick a new running back for my fantasy football team.
that's too bad.
I had a little fantasy thing planned of my own.
whoa.
Lynette's not here right now.
I'm Brandy, the slutty cheerleader.
this is all very romantic, Gaby, but I still have four building proposals to read before tomorrow.
that's nurse Gaby to you.
nurse Gaby?
am I sick?
well, the doctor says you need to relax, and i know just how to relax you.
it smells like licorice.
it's a blend of 36 essential oils, anise root and fennel.
do you like it?
it smells a little medicine.
that's the fennel.
it's stinging a little.
that's the tension...leaving your body.
it's really stinging.
and we can rinse it off...in three to five minutes.
but before we do that...
what the hell is that?
you know, for a guy getting rubbed down by a hot nurse, - you ask a lot of questions. - Sorry.
Oh, come on, uncle Frank.
what's the point of having a gay uncle if youe not gonna help me make friends with these guys?
Oh.
uh, mom said that the whole family knew.
um, okay. Gotta go. Love you.
what's going on?
Oh, I found Raphael wandering in the street.
I went to take him back, but Bob and Lee aren't home, so I'm just gonna give him a little treat and put him back in their yard.
wait a second. - What?
leave him with me. I need to score some points with those guys, and being a dog-rescuing hero could be just the ticket.
so what, you're just gonna keep him here until they come back?
Uh-huh.
maybe a little longer.
how long?
well, long enough for them to worry.
you know, the more they worry, the more I'm a hero. Get it?
I get that you're insane. - I'm not, I'm not.
now get some mud. I wanna dirty him up so he looks like he's been through hell.
okay, in you go.
here, let me help you with those.
Oh, that's all right. I've got them, Mr. Knievel.
Oh, boy.
you're nevegonna let me live this down, are you?
Nope.
I thought the same thing. - It seems to me that you should go to the doctor again.
surprise!
uh, guys...
what did I tell you? - You said "no shower."
but look around--men.
so technically, it's a party, not a shower.
andrew told us that you only said no...
cause you didn't want to impose.
Oh!
so you're responsible?
Yeah, well, I-I know you said not to make a big fuss, but, hey, you earned it.
well, don't just stand there. Come in.
we have lots of food and fun and surprises.
Yeah, all kinds of surprises.
where is she?
I, uh, helped with the invitations, too.
I can't tell you how touched I was to be included, especially after my many conciliatory gesture were so coldly rebuffed.
I have been awful.
I wouldn't blame you if you stormed out right now.
non sense.
I'm here to celebrate our renewed friendship...
and your baby.
or should I say babies?
you know, it's often a sign of twins when a mother's face gets all plump like yours.
Oh, um...
I, uh, bet you wouldn't mind if I broke my neck on that scooter now.
I'm off to the bank.
aunt Lily just took a pill, so she's down for the afternoon.
okay. Have fun.
is your mother gone? - Yeah. Do you need her?
no, no.
this is what I wanted.
I thought you took a sleeping pill.
I pretended to so she'd leave us alone.
aunt Lily, what's going on?
I have to tell you something.
first, you should know that what happened...
it was nobody's fault.
what do you mean, "what happened"?
you don't remember living on this street before, do you?
no.
well...
there's a reason for that.
mom, I thought you left.
I forgot my checkbook.
could you go down and find it for me? - Sure.
you really should get your rest.
Hey.
Hi. - Hi.
got your wig back, huh? - Yeah.
good as new.
listen, I thought we could put the kids to bed early tonight, if you know what I mean.
I do, and I'm up for that.
fantastic.
I hope Brandy won't get stuck late at cheerleading practice.
Oh, about brandy...bad news.
what? What--what happened?
well, Penny wanted to play beauty school with the wig, and, well, let's just say she's got no future as a stylist.
bad haircut, huh? - Oh.
sounds like Brandy might get awful mad about that.
Brandy's history, Tom. Let her go.
come home, boy!
is something wrong? - Raphael got out.
I-I don't know what happened. I think he jumped the fence.
Oh.
well, would you like me to help you look for him?
Seriously?
what a--what about your party? - Oh.
it's just a baby shower...
that I'm throwing... for my best friend.
I can't--I can't ask you to leave that. - That's-- oh, please.
what are neighbors for?
here, puppy!
I see you've taken down all the pictures of Rex.
well, I'm, uh, sorry if that offends you, Phyllis, but I didn't want Orson to feel uncomfortable in his new home.
I see.
you're trying to be considerate of your husband's feelings.
well, I'm glad that you're at least trying to get it right the second time around.
still, it must be awfully hard on Danielle and Andrew to have their father's face banished from their own home.
he wasn't banished.
by the way...
Where--where's Danielle?
she's, uh, at boarding school...in Switzerland.
Switzerland?!
is it asking too much to be told what continent my granddaughter is on?!
you are keeping my grandchildren from me, and I don't know why.
I'm going to mingle.
every time I start a chat, you walk away.
I mean, if you don't want to talk to me, why did you invite me?
it's a surprise party, you daft woman!
what makes you think I had a hand in the guest list?
so...
you don't want me here?
Oh, for god sakes, Phyllis, it's not as if we got along when Rex was alive.
what did I ever do to you but try to treat you like a daughter?
I even gave you my mother's sable coat.
you hated your mother. - But I loved that coat.
then I'll give it back to you.
no, you keep it as a reminder of howard I tried to make you like me.
grandma, are you leaving already?
I'm sorry, dear, but your mother has made it impossible for me to stay.
where does she keep my sable coat?
probably in her bedroom closet.
where is she going?
she asked me where your fur coat was.
and--and you told her?!
Oh, crap.
I guess you won't be needing the breast pump I bought you.
so... Danielle is having a baby.
Yes, and for the sake of her reputation, we've agreed to pretend that it's mine.
I just hope that those Swiss doctors know what they're doing.
she's not in Switzerland.
she's at the sisters of hope convent.
look, Phyllis, I'm sorry. I know this is upsetting.
actually, I'm thrilled.
I'm going to be a great-grandma.
well, um...
technically, yes.
what do you mean, "technically"?
we're saying that the baby is mine and Orson's, and if you hover around like a grandmother, people will be suspicious.
you're not keeping this baby from me, not if you don't want me to tell those people downstairs - whose child it really is. - You wouldn't.
think of Danielle!
I wish you had.
if you'd rsed her properly, she wouldn't be pregnant without a husband.
you think I don't know I'm a failure as a parent?
that's why this child means so much to me.
it's my second chance.
well, I hope the second time around that you take my advice.
I always said that you were too strict with those kids.
parenting tips from you? That's rich.
I was a wonderful mother to Rex.
then why did he always avoid you?
why were you barely ever here?
because of you!
he knew you hated me.
Oh, heas happy to let you think that, but he was the one who dreaded your visits.
Oh.
Phyllis, wait!
excuse me, everyone, but I have something to say.
What--what is it, grandma?
I have to go.
like just one how have so much time
goodbye thank you for the gift.
you know, Bree, you're not the only one who would like a second chance.
nothing, huh? - No.
no, he's lost.
and he doesn't know this neighborhood.
there's no way he's gonna find his way home.
Oh, he will. Come on. You gotta keep believing.
Oh, crap!
Bob's home. What am I gonna tell him?
don't. We'll just keep looking.
I have a feeling we're gonna find that cute little guy.
you--you are so nice to do this,
I mean, especially after the way I acted when we first...
you know what? Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna go inside and get us some water, - and then we're gonna just keep looking. - Okay.
I can't find Raphael. You seen him anywhere?
Oh, Bob, prom--promise you won't hate me.
what are you talking about? What happened?
Raphael got out.
he got out? - Yeah.
he doesn't know the neighborhood.
I know he doesn't know the neighborhood. - What are you talking about?
how are you looking for him?
Oh, wait, he's right there.
Hey, hey.
Oh! Hey! Hey!
Oh! Oh, my god!
what was our dog doing in your garage?
I have no idea.
what?
did you get a chance to, uh, napalm the jungle yet?
Yep.
And?
all quiet on the southern front.
Gaby, we have got to be more careful.
Absolutely.
it's kind of exciting, though.
what is?
playing with fire, almost getting burned but not quite.
don't be thinking like that.
if Victor catches us, he'll kill us both.
that's what's so exciting.
Hi.
Hi. - Oh, my--excuse me.
Mmm, that's, um...
an interesting cologne you're wearing.
my wife gave it to me. It's got, uh, anise root, fennel.
what, you like it?
Yeah, it's just, um...
I don't know...
weirdly familiar.
crab cake?
uh, yeah.
Thanks.
crab cake?
crab cake?
crab cake?
kids are asleep.
I'm not.
what got back there? - Just a little present.
say hello to Brandy's even sluttier sister...
what are you doing?
well, I just--I just thought since we had so much fun last night, maybe we can have a little more fun.
and that's only possible when you're pretending I'm someone else?
well, you have to pretend, too.
what?
this...
is me, Tom, not Brandy or Candy.
it's just your wife, lynette.
am I not enough for you?
what are you getting so mad for?
the first wig was your idea.
Yeah, because I'm bald.
and I know that that's a big old turnoff, but, you know, I can't help it.
I have cancer. - Yes, I know.
I hear about it all the time.
can you blame me for wanting to escape every once in a while?
escape from me, you mean? - Yes!
you know why last night was so much fun?
because I got to make love to someone who wasn't sick.
look, I know, I know, I'm not supposed to say this stuff.
I have to be the heroic husband who listens and holds you when you cry and never cries himself.
but this affects me, too.
well... I know that.
you do? - Yeah.
how?
since this whole thing began, have you ever once asked me how I'm doing?
Oh...
my god. I haven't, have I?
I am one of those...whiny, self-involved sick people.
I didn't say that. - No, I am.
it's been months, and I have barely thought about what you're going through.
it's okay.
you're going through something - will you stop being so heroic?!
I'm a cancer bitch!
what?
I'm not gonna argue with you.
you suck.
well...
I guess I could give Candy a whirl.
are the kids really asleep?
cause I think she might be a screamer.
actually, if wre gonna pretend...
how about tonight I'm not a hero and you are not a cancer patient?
we'll just be Tom and Lynette, see what happens.
Oh, I'd like that.
how's Bob's suit?
ruined. - Oh.
what if we take it to my cleaners? - Susan, that paint's not coming out...
so we're buying him a new suit...for 2, 000 bucks.
$2, 000?
well, according to Lee, it's a Dolce.
I don't know what that means, but he said it six times.
that's crazy.
no, what's crazy is I'm about to buy the most expensive suit of my life, - and I'll never wear it. - Oh.
I just wanted them to like me. - Well, they don't.
lee said that six times, too.
there must be some way I can apologize to them.
we can't afford any more of your apologies.
I know. Uh, maybe if I.
damn it, Susan, let it go, okay?
I asked you to before, and you didn't, and look what happened.
so I'll ask you again. Just let it go.
Mike, wait. We should talk about this.
I'm going to bed.
I've gotta work tomorrow.
I'm buying a suit.
grandma!
what are you doing here?
you needn't be embarrassed, dear.
your mother's told me everything.
it's great to see you.
I hate this place. It's like baby jail.
well, that's what I've come to talk to you about.
perhaps it's time for you to leave.
is that you? We have--have to talk.
Hey.
I'm glad you're home.
I wanted to talk to you about aunt Lily.
what about her?
it was so weird.
she called me into her room this afternoon.
she started saying she knew why I didn't remember living on this street before.
Oh, sweetie.
your aunt Lily is fading fast.
half the time, she doesn't know what she's saying.
was that her?
no, I just checked on her. She's sleeping.
you know, you have that recital in two weeks.
shouldn't you be practicing?
please!
pests, they come in all shapes and sizes and disrupt our lives in a variety of ways.
at first, they're merely annoying, and we do our best to ignore them.
but if we don't take them seriously, they can become quite dangerous.
for some, death seems to be the easiest solution.
but the problem with pests is that what they leave behind...is just as dangerous.
Gaby, I'm getting married.
and I was married when we got together.
that is not how I'm gonna be married.
Lynette got the support she needed for chemotherapy.
Katherine, who liked everything in its place...
Yeah, I've seen a lot of cable, so I get it.
I hope we can live up to your stereotype.
I should go.
the odd-Looking boxes were delivered to the home of Bob Hunter and Lee Mcdermott early on a Tuesday morning.
it wasn't long before workmen had opened them and begun assembling the various parts and pieces.
happily, it only took three hours to turn the contents into a finished work of art.
sadly, it only took 15 minutes for e residents of Wisteria Lane...
what the hell is it?
to become art critics.
I think it's a sculpture.
I think it's crap.
of a the gay men in the world, we have to get the two without taste.
what are we gonna do about this?
I say we keep smiling and look for the hidden cameras.
I think we're about to get punk' d.
I don't think there's anything we can do.
it's not our lawn.
it's our neighborhood,
and we have rules against this sort of thing,
or at least we did when I used to live here.
who's running the homeowners association?
well, it was Mary Alice, but as you may have heard...
and a husband who's been looking for the doorknob.
what? You've met him.
Ooh! They're coming.
good morning, ladies. - Hi.
uh, we were just talking about your sculpture.
that's what I love about art-- The way it provokes discussion.
although it would've been nice if you had discussed it with us.
what, you don't-- You don't like it?
well, we're not saying that.
it's just a little, uh...It's an eyesore.
Really?
you hear that, Bob?
we flew to Finland and paid $24,000 to commission an eyesore.
I don't mind it.
not to brag, but I went to art school.
community college.
and they taught us that art is subjective.
thank you, Susan.
Susan's need for approval aside, this clearly is not appropriate for the street.
Wisteria Lane has a traditional look.
well, maybe you'd like it better if we covered it with a gingham throw.
ladies, uh, I'm sorry.
we honestly thought that people would like it, but even if you disapprove, we hope that you will respect our right to decorate as we see fit.
have a nice day, Philistines.
Yes, art came to Wisteria Lane on a Tuesday morning, and by Tuesday afternoon...I think it's time to reconvene the homeowners' association.
all in favor?
Aye.
war had come as well.
as word of the sculpture spread, Bob and Lee began to wonder if any of their neighbors would be supportive.
but when the sculpture's true function was unveiled the next day, whatever support they did have...was quickly washed away.
come on.
it's 6: 00 a.m.
what is that?
I don't know, but make it stop.
Oh, my God.
it's a fountain, too.
we would have mentioned that yesterday, but your friends were a little uptight.
Yeah, they can get like that.
so do you think that you can just turn it off for a second?
what's up?
I was just wondering, um, do you think you could move it to your backyard?
Why? I thought you liked it.
remember? You said,"art is subjective."
Yes.
quiet art is subjective,
but you see, Mike is working really long hours lately, and he can't sleep with all that noise.
we're not gonna turn it off
because we need it to drown out all the stuff we hear coming from your house.
like what?
let's see. You yakking to your mom on the phone.
you grunting through your Pilates DVDs.
you in the shower, butchering the score to Brigadoon.
I have a lovely voice.
whoever told you that is not your friend.
he's a little cranky.
I think someone needs his French toast.
come on, Lee.
no, no, no, no. No, no, we're not done here.
as your neighbor, i have a right to be heard...
and I say that simple human decency dictates that you turn off that fountain right now!
Hey, guys.
do over, Parker.
Hey, guys, I got your snack.
what you playing?
action figures.
wanna play, mom?
she does awesome alien voices.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Hello?
Oh, yeah. Hi, Dr. Iller.
okay, that's my white blood count.
Uh-huh, but as long as it's higher than 4.0, That means I don't have neutropenia, right?
well, that's great.
thanks for calling.
Yeah, you, too.
Bye.
what?
you can't talk about doctors up here.
or about being sick.
if you do, you have to go.
that's the rule.
well... that's a good rule.
although it wasn't bad news.
it was actually-- - Doesn't matter.
we voted.
it's a rule.
got it.
sick talk done, okay?
you guys have fun.
freeze power.
do over, Parker.
that guy doesn't have freezing power.
if his guy can fly, my guy can freeze.
Hi. It's, uh Mrs. Hodge.
may I please speak with Danielle?
muffins.
hands off.
we're bringing these to Dielle for her birthday.
what do you mean, she's gone?
and you believed her?
you idiot!
I should sue your irresponsible yeah, Well, good day to you, too, reverend mother!
what happened?
those stupid nuns at the convent let Danielle's grandmother kidnap her.
she claimed I'd given her permission for a weekend visit.
it's me.
you can screen your calls all you want to, but trust me, old woman, you are in a world of trouble.
I know where you live, and I am coming for you.
shouldn't we be worried?
no, I think we're ready for her.
now show me again how you kill the zombies.
why can't I go?
I play golf.
and I'd love to meet you...College buddies.
Edie, me and the guys have only two rules for these weekends?
no women
fine.
be that way.
and to think, I got you a gift.
Hey, golf balls.
they're monogrammed.
wait. These are your initials.
exactly.
while you're out there playing, want everyone to know who your balls belong to.
good work, boys, but I have to head out in a few minutes, so make sure you put all the stuff back in the garage.
Hello?
Hey, on my way.
meet you at the hotel, okay?
I'm leaving in five minutes.
uh, Brett, could you come here a second?
how long has that van been parked over there?
couple hours.
hours?
are you serious?
Oh, my God.
I think he's just waiting for someone to come home.
Brett, when's the last time a cable guy waited for anyone?
I see a lot of lawn mowing in your future.
Hey, it's me again.
you're not gonna believe this.
before Victor left on his business trip, he hired someone to tail me.
Oh, man. Should we call this off?
no way.
it's gonna take more than a guy with mini binoculars and a bag of doughnuts to keep me under lock d key.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
boys, time to get paid.
come on, Eddie!
come back here!
are you taking the bus home?
as soon as we get around the corner, we're gonna have to adjust this horn.
Gabrielle. Hey.
h-hi.
look at you.
what a surprise.
Oh, uh, this is Gaby.
this is my wife Tammy.
Tammy, this is Gabrielle.
wow, look at you.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
it wasn't planned.
okay.
so... are you guys staying here?
no, we just came for some lunch.
daddy owns this place.
that's right.
you're a hotel heiress.
Yeah, but not one of the skanky ones.
how do you two know each other?
I used to be Gabrielle's gardener.
Oh! Well, as you can see, he's certainly married up from lawn boy.
Tammy. - What?
forget it.
so I heard you married the mayor.
you're married to Victor Lang?
he and daddy go hunting together.
I told John if he would just be nicer to daddy, he could hang out with people like the mayor and make important contacts.
and I keep telling you that I don't need to kiss your father's ass to have a career.
uh, yeah, so I married the mayor.
kooky, huh?
so, um, is he here with you?
uh, no.
he's away at a conference, so I decided to treat myself to a spa weekend.
you should definitely get the full body massage.
Oh, I plan to.
good to see you.
you, too, Gaby.
sorry about that.
a complete shock. I mean, of all people to run into.
who were they?
just an old friend and his idiot wife.
come on. Let's go.
Bree, how lovely to see you.
cram it, Phyllis.
you got a lot of nerve stealing Danielle from a convent we prepaid for.
she didn't steal me.
I'm a mature person capable of making my own decisions.
well, good. You can decide to pack, because we are taking you back to the convent.
I'm turning 18 this weekend, so you can't boss me around anymore.
I'm staying with grandma,
and I'm gonna have my baby delivered here.
we have an excellent medical staff.
it's a retirement village.
all these doctors know how to deliver is bad news.
I don't care.
I'm staying, and I'm gonna raise the baby here, too.
what?
entirely her idea.
a baby is god's most precious gift.
I will not have mine raised by a cold, emotionally unavailable woman like you.
emotionally unavailable.
gosh, I wonder where she picked up that little phrase.
like I'm too dumb to think of it myself?
you're always mean to me, just like you were to dad.
you emasculated him.
well, you're not gonna emasculate me.
you don't even know what that means, you petulant sock puppet!
who cares?
I'm going to the store.
buy a dictionary.
so that's all settled.
would you like some iced tea?
you aren't joining the lunch mob?
uh, you mean Katherine's homeowners thing?
Yeah, I think I'll sit this one out.
no, no, no. You can't do that.
you've got to pick a side.
art or mindless conformity?
see, this is one of the upsides of having cancer.
you get to excuse yourself from petty neighborhood squabbles.
you won't think they're so petty when she comes after you.
me?
why would she do that?
did the homeowners' association approve everything in your yard?
the fence?
that swing?
the tree house?
I don't think Katherine will bother herself over a tree house.
first, they came for the fountains, and I did not speak out because I had no fountain.
what?
then they came for the lawn gnomes, And I did not speak out because I had no gnome.
you're comparing Katherine to a Nazi?
then they came for my tree house,
and there was no one left to speak out for me.
thank you, ladies.
I so appreciate your input, and I think we can all agree that the fountain has no place on our street.
Yeah, we gotta show those gays we mean business.
Ida, again, the issue is not Bob and Lee being gay.
it's t fountain.
well, can't it be both?
anyway...
if you elect me president, my first act will be to eliminate the so-called work of art.
hear, hear.
Yes, Lynette.
after you get rid of this fountain, that's it, right?
I don't follow.
I mean...You're not gonna start checking everyone's yards for things that don't fit in?
Oh, of course not.
as long as those things meet the association's guideline.
and what if they don't?
are you referring to something in particular?
my kids' tree house.
can you promise you'll leave it alone?
well, it's not up to me.
that's the whole point.
there are rule that sounds like a no.
if I make an exception for you, then I have to make one for everyone,
and surely, you realize that the whole neighborhood can't revolve around your little tree house.
now since I am running unopposed, I just need someone to second my nomination.
Oh! Thank you, Lynette no, actually, I'm nominating myself.
I am now running for president...
against you.
you know, running for president in your condition?
I don't think it's a good idea.
Tom, I don't want your opinion, just your vote.
if you want to save the tree house, why don't you let me run instead?
because you'd never win.
bossy women rule this street. You know that.
I know one rules my life.
I'm sorry. I didn't catch that.
nothing.
look, this is not just about a tree house or a fountain.
this is about what kind of neighborhood we want to live in.
do we get to make our own choices, or do we let the taste police make them for us?
Ah, now I get it.
this about you wanting to take on Katherine.
No!
this is about personal freedom?
honey, if you're looking for something to fight, how about your cancer?
Hey, a tumor is a tumor whether it's in your body or living across the street.
I don't know why you buy those things.
they just end up on the floor.
because I want to feel pretty and feminine.
my chili cheese fries!
just a second!
it's me--John.
John who?
uh, okay.
you know that old friend I ran into in the lobby?
it might have been John Rowland.
maybe.
I'm not sure.
but just to be safe, you may wanna hide in the closet.
what? I'm not hiding from that guy.
Really?
because his father-In-Law goes hunting with Victor?
John, what are you doing here?
when I ran into you last fall, you wanted to start up our affair again, and I wasn't ready.
well, I'm ready.
Hey.
listen, I promised Tom I wouldn't knock myself out campaigning for this homeowners thing, so I was hoping you could help me?
I would love to, but...
but what?
this is awkward.
uh, I told Katherine I'd vote for her.
you're picking her over me?
uh, it's not like I'm pro-Katherine.
I'm just anti - fountain.
Oh, don't give me that look.
I made her a promise.
okay.
if I vote for you, do you promise to get rid of that fountain?
see, that's awkward for me.
this is about personal freedom. You know?
I'm running as a libertarian.
well, I'm voting as a light sleeper.
it's right outside our bedroom window.
seriously, Lynette, it's like living next to splash mountain.
but it's my kids' tree house.
they really need it.
well, we need our sleep.
why don't you get earplugs?
why don't you get...tree house plugs?
what?
that doesn't even make sense.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
you know, tired people aren't witty.
seriously, John, you have got to get out of here.
no.
please.
I need to be with you.
what about your wife?
you met her.
she's dumb, demanding, totally self-centered, especially in bed.
I mean, she's awful.
awfully pregnant.
I know.
I-I'm completely trapped, just like you were with Mr. Solis.
what...
I-I wasn't trapped.
what do you mean?
all you'd ever talk about was what a selfish pig he was.
well, I think you're paraphrasing.
okay, seriously, you have to go.
come on.
you know it could be hot, just like old times.
remember how great our sex was?
Oh, I don't think we need to get into that.
what about the time we were doing it in the shower?
Mr. Solis drove up?
uh, does not ring a bell.
come on.
and I hid the closet?
and you looked so hot, Mr. Solis pulled you down on the bed.
and you had to fake an orgasm just so he wouldn't catch on.
Yeah, good times.
anyways, uh, that's a negatory on the affair... - What?
and I will see you later.
come on, but we're so good together.
Gaby-- Please!
boy, that was a close one, huh?
you faked it with me while that wax job was hiding in the closet?
Yes, I had an affair.
old news. Move on.
Where's that room service?
so you're not gonna apologize for humiliating me in my own bed?
you deserved it.
all you cared about back then was work.
Hey, I was not that bad of a husband, and somebody had to support your Italian shoe addition.
I shopped because I was bored and lonely?
Yeah, with our teenage gardener!
I should have snapped that kid's neck two years ago.
Oh, let it go!
John Rowland didn't do anything to you that you're not doing to Victor.
you can't even compare the two!
it's completely different!
is it, Mr. Man in the closet?
Yeah, you heard me.
who's John Rowland now?
Katherine, what are you up to?
just visiting a friend.
liar.
you're campaigning.
Cookies--Nice touch.
Ditto on the scarf.
Edie, you got a moment?
I am running for president of the homeowners' association,
and I want to talk to you about that horrible fountain.
screw the fountain.
you want my support?
make Ida Greenberg ditch that screen door.
looks fine to me. It's hardly ripped at all.
in fact, if you give me your support...I'll make Mrs. Burkette prune those roses.
it's a garden, not a jungle, and you shouldn't have to...pay for a fence you don't even want.
that's not how you make good neighbors, and I don't care if...The Mustafas don't celebrate Christmas.
you're asking them to hang a few lights, not convert.
when I'm president, I promise...you can keep that satellite dish.
in fact, this is practically a first amendment issue.
the way I see it...the entire neighborhood should be a testament to symmetry and beauty.
So...Have I got your vote?
um, I'm not sure yet.
keep rubbing.
Bree, I know you're upset, but you've got to eat.
I'm just so mad at myself.
I should have realized is so strong, that even Danielle would develop it.
what's so funny?
you know those animals who eat their young?
even they have more maternal instinct than Danielle.
then why would she want the child?
you've known her how long, And you still haven't figured out how that lentil she calls a brain works?
there's no need to insult your sister. - Let him talk.
all right, Danielle cares about three things
Danielle, fun, and, uh...
wait. I was wrong. It's just two.
and a retirement village is fun?
compared to what you're offering her?
a crappy job and county college.
I mean, you think grandma's gonna make her do any of that?
so Danielle's only doing this because Phyllis is offering her a cushy life?
Yeah.
if you want that baby, you're gonna have to outbid grandma.
what are you doing here?
Hi, John.
I wanted to talk to you.
it'll be very friendly. No hitting.
what's up?
this is gonna sound weird, But, uh, I've been doing some thinking lately,
and, well, I've decided that it's time for me to forgive you.
for sleeping with my wife.
Yeah, well, I didn't just sleep with Gaby.
I fell in love with her.
I forgive you for that, too.
why are you doing this?
you in some kind of 12-Step program?
let's just say I've recently learned
how loving someone makes you forget the difference between right and wrong.
anyway, that's pretty much it. I should go.
Hey.
do you still talk to Gabrielle?
occasionally. Why?
I just want to know if she was happy.
I think she is.
well...
good for her.
all right, before we vote, are there any more questions for the candidates?
anybody besides Lee? - It's not a question.
I just want to remind everyone that a vote for Katherine is a vote for fascism.
what is it with you gay people and clothes?
fascism, Ida, not fashion.
although if you ever do want to talk fashion, we're here for you.
all right, debate's over.
all in for Lynette okay, and those for Kathrine?
that's 14 for Lynette and 14 for Katherine.
so what do we do? It's a tie.
Ah!
no, it's not. Susan voted twice.
did I?
well, that's obviously wrong.
you only get one vote, sweet cheeks. Who's it gonna be?
Susan, we're waiting.
it's up to you, honey.
Katherine. - Oh!
okay, it's official. Katherine is our new president.
thank you.
thank you, everyone, and I promise to do my best for this neighborhood.
and, Bob, Lee, Mr.Mustafa, I'll be in touch regarding your various infractions.
Oh. And you, too, Lynette.
meeting adjourned.
Oh.
I'm sorry you know, Phyllis, we cannot thank you enough for accepting our apology.
well, I think we should try to stay on good terms for Danielle's sake.
I'm glad you suggested that we eat out here.
I never think to do this.
Oh, damn, I forgot the napkins. - Oh, no problem.
I'll go get some.
so now that we have a moment alone,
your mother and I would like to say how proud we are of you.
Yeah, right.
seriously, we hadn't realized you'd matured enough well yourself grandma's gonna help.
she'll do what she can, but you mustn't overtax her.
her heart is not very strong.
she seems nice to me.
well, knock wood.
we'd hate to see you forced to take care of a baby and a sick old woman.
Whoa! Mah-Jongg.
don't see that much anymore.
Hey, hey.
Danielle, you should introduce yourself.
these people are your new friends.
and you're going to learn more from their experience and wisdom
than you ever could have learned at that college in Florida.
wait. I thought I couldn't go there.
you said it was just a party school.
well, actually, we checked into the curriculum, and it's very strong, but no matter. You'd be happier here.
Yes, and with a grandmother's unconditional love, Who needs frat boys who only like you for your convertible?
whoa. When did I get a convertible?
well, we were gonna surprise you with one for your birthday,
but since you're keeping the baby, You'll want a more practical gift.
we're thinking a diaper service.
Oh, look, they have water aerobics.
up!
out.
you should sign up.
you know, maybe I should go to college.
I mean, for the boy's sake.
how can support it without a degree?
but you can't raise this child in a Miami dorm room.
you'll need to leave it with someone you can trust to take care of it properly.
sorry. The elevator's outi...
I have to catch my breath.
grandma?
we need to talk.
what's this? - I thought we might toast my victory.
I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
Oh.
So...you haven't congratulated me yet.
I know.
would you like to tell me what's bothering you?
I just want you to think about what you've been doing for the past few days.
you've mounted a crusade against a metal thing that shoots out water.
I'm trying to keep the neighborhood beautiful. I love this street.
Yeah, you keep saying that
how happy you used to be here,
but ever since we've moved back, All I've seen is an unhappy woman who needs to control everything.
when you lose control.
should again
tell you something else we learned there.
when the chips are down, it helps to have friends.
and you certainly haven't made us any lately.
Congratulations.
Bye, grandma. - Good-Bye, dear.
tell your stepfather I'll be right out.
Oh please, Phyllis.
even you have to agree that a girl who'd trade her baby for a convertible isn't ready for motherhood.
she'd have changed once the baby came.
she's her father's daughter.
that's a nice picture of Rex.
Oh, I have a lot of pictures.
all of the women here do.
they're what we have left of the things time has taken from us...
youth, homes and husbands...And for the unluckiest, children.
I thought I was getting back a part of Rex.
but now...
I know you're lonely, Phyllis, But I can't give up this child just to make you feel better.
you should go.
your family's waiting for you.
Orson and I go to our club almost every Saturday night, if you're...Interested in babysitting.
you mean it?
how will you explain me to your friends?
I'll say that you're broke and needed the money.
can't you just say that you like having me around?
I need something that will fly, Phyllis.
Hey. What's going on?
we need to talk.
so here's the deal.
I think it's time for us to do the right thing.
I don't think I like where this is going.
we have to end this affair - you serious? - All this...Sneaking around, wearing disguises, hiding in closets?
it's just wrong.
we're better than this.
so what are you suggesting, we stay with Victor and Edie?
no, we break up with them.
look, it'll hurt, but at least it's honest.
and then when enough time has gone by and they've moved on,
we can be together.
how long are we talking about?
I don't know. Six months?
six months?
nobody takes that long to heal anymore.
it's a breakup, not a face-lift.
Hey, look, I want us to be together, too, but I also wanna myself good about it.
don't you?
Yeah.
I do.
you're such a good guy, Carlos.
I really hate that about you.
I know.
so...I guess this is it.
this kiss has to last six months.
you better make it good.
Hey, Lynette.
Hey, Judas.
okay, fine. You're still angry, but I'm gonna make it up to you.
when they come after that tree house, they're going to have one Susan Mayer chained to it.
don't do that.
I wanna be sad when they knock it down.
Lynette! - What?
you think you can just walk over here and cute your way out of what you did?
we're supposed to be friends.
exactly, and friends don't put friends in this kind of position.
I love you, but you can't ask me to put your kids ahead of my husband.
no, Parker, that guy doesn't have freezing...
you're right. I shouldn't have done that.
but that tree house is the one place my kids can go and not hear about body scans and white blood cell counts.
it is their getaway from this horrible thing that I've brought into the house.
brought?
sweetie, it's not your fault that you're sick.
I know that...here.
but here...it feels like I've ruined their childhood.
okay, if anybody needs me, I'll be at the hardware ore buying chains.
Oh, Jeez. Get over here.
hello there!
Oh, look, it's our new queen... Katherine of arrogant.
Hey, where's the wrecking ball?
actually, I came to tell you the tree house can stay.
Oh, my God. That's great!
Yes.
if anyone complains, we'll say it was grandfathered in under the previous administration.
Wow.
Thanks.
Why?
clearly, it means a lot to you, and I wanna be a good neighbor.
what's with you? Sometimes you act like an ice queen, and then you do something really nice.
you are one complicated lady.
well, I've had one complicated life.
I've had a lot of men in my life, but I never let myself fall in love before.
I thought it was because I didn't wanna get hurt, but...now I know the pain you feel isn't the worst part.
it's the hate.
could you make it out to "cash"?
Hello, Katherine.
you here about the fountain?
Yes, but don't worry. There's no strict deadline. You can...have it removed at your earliest convenience.
Yeah, I don't think it's going anywhere.
Oh, boys, boys, the war's over.
Yes, it is.
we know all about Chicago.
come again?
my ex is on the board of Chicago memorial hospital.
seems your husband made quite a stir there...whole hospital still buzzing about what he did.
whatever you heard is a vicious lie...every word of it.
still, it was enough to...make you leave town, which begs the question, do you like living here?
Oh, good. We're in agreement. The fountain stays.
thanks for stopping by, Katherine.
it's the same for all of us.
we try not to get too close to the people who live next door.
it's easier to give them a polite nod than to ask what's wrong.
it's safer to keep walking by than to get involved...
you right now. Okay, I don't wanna work...
true, we sometimes do get to know the people we share a fence with and end up lifelong friends.
thanks for everything. - Thank you.
but mostly, we keep our distance because we'd rather our neighbors know nothing about us...than know too much.
Lynette couldn't forgive her mother's past.
you had Tom to come home to.
I had your stepfather.
Hey, Glen may have bored you, but the years we had a father in that house were the happiest of my life.
you drove him away.
mom, where's grandma going?
Bree got her second chance to be a good mother.
Mike's dependency grew...
addicts are experts at deception.
get up. I wanna see the look on your face when the knife goes in.
and Victor was lost at sea.
we think of the past as water under the bridge, a current that carries away the mistakes of our youth -
the loves we lost...
the addictions we gave into...
the opportunities we threw away...
but sooner or later, reminders drift back into our lives of the mistakes we made and the sins we committed.
Carlos, why are you calling me?
I told you we can't be seen together.
I can't take it anymore.
we gotta go to the cops.
Oh, okay. And say what?
Yes, officer, my lover and I knocked my husband overboard twice and left him for dead.
okay. Bye-bye.
I don't think so.
but he's the mayor.
you know, people are gonna notice he's missing, and then they're gonna ask questions.
let them ask.
no one knows we were on that boat.
let's just play dumb and ride this thing out.
Gaby, don't you feel guilty? A man is dead.
Yes, I feel awful, but he threatened our lives.
it was self-defense.
exactly. So then why don't we go and tell the police?
he took the lord's name in vain.
look, we have a good plan.
let's just stick to it.
okay, okay. I won't say anything.
good.
now until this blows over, don't call me again.
what are you doing now?
I'm praying for a miracle.
Carlos, if Victor had lived, he would've killed us.
I'm thinking we already had our miracle.
Yes, the mistakes of our past have a way of drifting back into our lives...and when they do...we have to pay for them.
one day in the early fall, Mike Delfino hurt his shoulder.
God.
to ease his pain, he took a little white pill recommended by his doctor.
the pain persisted, so he took another...and another.
unfortunately, when Mike's pain began to subside, his need for the little white pills...did not.
but Mike never shared this with those who cared about him, only with those who could not have cared less.
Hey, it's Mike.
I'm out. I need to meet you tomorrow.
great. Got that money you owe me?
no, but you know I'm good for it.
you price chemistry textbooks lately?
they're, like, 300 bucks.
I need my money, Mike.
and you'll get it, all right?
can't you just front me something for now?
well, advice is free. Pills aren't.
my advice--get some cash.
so, hey, you know, I better get going.
Yeah, um, I should, too.
Hey!
mom.
can we talk?
this will just take a second.
did you kiss that boy?
no, I was kind of interrupted.
Oh, well, you're gonna thank me.
do you know that he has his tongue pierced?
Yeah. He showed me.
how do you know?
I checked out his web page.
you did not.
I did, too, and do you know what else he has pierced?
and if you do, you're grounded.
okay, yes, mom, Derek has bought into the who piercing craze, but aren't you the one who told me to not judge a book by its cover?
if the cover has holes in it, the book is no good.
okay, this conversation is over.
I am going to kiss Derek good night.
Oh, fine. Break my heart.
why are you freaking out? We're just dating.
it's not like he's trying to put a ring on my finger.
trust me. Your finger is not where he'd put it.
Aw, he's so beautiful when he sleeps.
I'll put him in the crib.
no, he'll be sleeping with us.
Why? Is he running a fever?
he's fine, but I've been doing so reading, and more and more people say that babies sleep better next to their parents.
it's called the "family bed."
no, I've heard of that.
isn't it designed to facilitate breast-feeding?
partly.
what's your point?
you're not lactating.
if our son wants to be near the milk, he'll have to sleep in the refrigerator.
this isn't just for me and Benjamin.
this will help you bond with him, too.
Oh, perhaps, but it's sure not gonna help me bond with you.
darling, sex is the last thing women want right after they've given birth.
but you didn't give birth.
you watched and served refreshments.
well, that doesn't make caring for an infant any less tiring.
can't we just give it a chance?
I suppose.
what if I roll over and crush him?
don't.
Yes, hi. I'm looking for my mom.
she hangs out at your bar sometimes.
uh, older lady, big oker, talks like a teamster.
well, that's your fault for letting her run a tab.
look, if you see her, could you tell her to call Lynette?
thank you.
I know that you are worried, but I am sure your mother is fine.
she's broke and old and rude.
that is not a winning combination on the street.
Stella is very resourceful.
didn't you tell me that she once made her own booze by putting a bag of oranges under the radiator?
Lucy, Lydia and I fought over who had to take her.
she was right outside.
God only knows what she heard us say.
Yeah, well, after the crap she put you guys through, you have every right to resent her.
it is a lot easier to resent your parents when you know they're safe in some retirement village, but to know that she's out there, maybe lying face down in an alley...this is exactly what she wants you to do.
she wants you to feel guilty.
don't buy into it.
okay.
okay. I guess you're right.
the morgue is listed under government offices, right?
Mrs. Lang?
the police are here.
ma'am. I'm detective Berry.
this is detective Lyons.
can we ask you a few questions?
of course.
when was the last time you saw Mr. Lang?
I guess two days ago.
Why? What's wrong?
his office has reported him missing.
Oh, no. They did?
and this morning, the coast guard found his empty boat floating in the bay.
Oh, my God.
I hope this isn't...
last time I saw him, I to him I was leaving him.
how did he react to that news?
well, he took it pretty hard.
Oh, you don't think he did anything stupid, do you?
well, actually, we don't.
you don't?
when we examined the boat, we didn't find a single fingerprint, not even Mr. Lang's.
well, that's weird.
What--what do you think that means?
it would indate somebody wiped that boat down after Mr. Lang was gone.
whoever was on that boat is clearly not that bright.
okay, this is no time for name-calling.
a man is missing.
well, don't worry, ma'am.
we got our best men on this case,'round the clock.
we'll find out exactly what happened to your husband.
great.
mom, want to mall with Derek back later J hi.
Hi. I'm Barrett.
is Mike home?
no, he's at work.
Oh, shoot. I needed to talk to him.
we're, uh, just doing some business together.
well, I don't know when he's gonna be home, but you could come back later tonight.
Oh, I can't do that.
I have to study for an Orgo test.
organic chemistry.
I'm pre-med.
pre-med?
Really?
Oh, hello, dear.
Andrew, get Orson's plate from the oven.
ask me how my morning was.
all right. How was it?
after two nights of sleepless bonding with my son, I nearly dozed off while repairing Mrs. Colby' s cracked molar.
I doubt if the crown I put in will last her a year.
so you'll replace it for free.
that's not the point.
how is a dentist supposed to feel when he can't give a 90-year-old a lifetime guarantee?
Bree, I'm sorry, but this whole family bed thing has to stop.
Oh, give it some time.
we're still adjusting, and Benjamin is sleeping so soundly.
well, he can sleep just as soundly in a crib.
from what you've told me, you and Rex didn't haul Andrew into bed with you.
no, and I wish we had.
if we did, he mightn't have turned out so...
so what?
stupid?
lazy?
short?
I was going to say angry, and perhaps that anger began when we exiled you to the nursery.
I'm just trying to learn from my mistakes.
so I'm--I'm what, like the first pancake?
don't be so sensitive.
we'll find something to help you sleep--maybe some warm milk.
I know something that used to help me sleep.
of course, that's off the menu these days.
could the mistake have the salt?
and if you're as tired as you say you are, then you're bound to sleep better tonight.
Yes, I will, because I'll be sleeping in the den.
you're leaving our bed?
darling, I need to either sleep or get lucky tonight.
I'll have a better shot at both if I'm alone.
gosh, you're studying to be a doctor.
that must not leave you a lot of free time for hobbies or a girlfriend.
well, I have the time.
I just don't have the girlfriend.
well, no rush.
you know, just yesterday, I was telling my daughter Julie -
Oh, you know, that is so rude.
I-I'm talking about daughter, and you don't even know what she looks like.
that's her.
she's cute.
Oh, Barrett, I wasn't fishing for compliments.
if I was, I would've shown you this one.
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry. I gotta take this.
Oh, sure. I have to check on the laundry.
yeah?
no, bonehead, I don't sell that stuff.
just pills, smokes and 'shroomage.
that's it.
20 bucks, cash only.
meet you at the dorm.
look what I found on the dryer.
Julie won second place in the state science fair.
that's awesome.
Yeah, good-looking and smart.
only problem is, where is she gonna find someone else like that?
well, I gotta get going.
my study partner's giving me a hard text about that test, so...
Oh, that's okay. You know, why don't you come back tomorrow to see me, and if Julie happens to be here, maybe you can give her some advice on picking out colleges and stuff.
Yeah, sounds great.
see you tomorrow, Mrs. Delfino.
Oh, please, call me mom.
uh, because that's what all the kids call me.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, Bree.
table for, uh, one and a half?
no, thanks. I'm just dropping off Andrew's cell phone.
he forgot it again.
okay. I'll give it to him.
um, Tom, may I ask you something?
did you and Lynette do the family bed when your children were babies?
well, it wasn't exactly a choice.
they just kept crawling in there.
so, um, not to pry, but, um, did that create any, uh, issues for you?
you mean sex?
Apparently,"not to pry" wasn't necessary.
well, it did put a crimp on things at first, but that just forced us to be more creative.
again, not to pry, but-- - the office.
we did it at the office, once in the car, and you remember when you asked us to watch the house when you guys were going out of town?
okay. Thanks.
Yes, um, we'll be going.
Hey, other than your issue, how does Orson like being a dad?
Oh, he just adores it.
the three of us are such a happy little family. Aren't we?
that is great.
Bye.
Bye.
should not leak anymore.
great.
why don't you grab us a couple beers?
what are you doing here?
beautiful house.
look, you need to leave.
I don't want Katherine finding you here.
Oh, but Katherine's gone.
I waited until she drove away so we could be alone.
aren't you gonna invite me in?
after you ruined my life?
I don't think so.
you ruined your own life.
you should have told the truth about us.
Sylvia, why don't you do us both a favor and go back to Chicago?
Adam, let me in.
Hey, man. Your, uh, your beer's getting warm.
Oh, you have guests.
well, I guess I'll just drop by some other time.
I'm sorry, man.
it just sounded like you needed a little help.
Thanks. That's, um, a-an ex-patient...With some pretty serious mental problems.
uh, could you do me a big favor?
I'd rather Katherine didn't know she was here.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's no problem.
you know, actually, I was gonna ask you a favor, too.
I've got this pain in my shoulder.
you--you think you could write me a prescription?
Oh, I wish I could help you out, but a gynecologist writing a prescription for a man?
it kind of raises a red flag.
Yeah. Ah, don't worry about it.
this favor thing doesn't have to go both ways.
Linda, is Mrs. Zimmerman here?
Hello, doctor.
what a wonderful surprise.
uh, I've got a new patient coming in.
Mmm, yes, you do.
I'm Mrs. Zimmerman.
uh, your message said you had a cavity that needed filling?
I was in a very naughty mood when I left that.
you're waiting outside.
why are you waiting outside?
everything is fine.
it's just, um, someone's here.
Oh, my God. It's the police?
no, no. No, nothing like that.
it's your stepfather.
I don't believe it.
Oh, it's been a long time.
Oh, God. Only three decades give or take a year, but who cares?
Oh, gosh.
you look great.
Oh, so do you, although what--what--what's this?
Oh, just a little cancer.
no, but I kicked its ass. I'm good now.
Hi. Hi. Hi. You come here.
so why--why are you here?
well... your mother called me.
she did?
is she okay?
uh, she sounds fine.
she asked for money.
I didn't know you guys had kept in touch.
well, we hadn't.
I'm meeting her tomorrow at Fairview Park to give it to her, and I'm guessing you'll want to come with me.
Yes, yes, thank you, but where has she been staying?
she broke into a car and spent the night there.
Oh, my God.
but she did say it was a Cadillac.
Oh, well, good. At least she's not living like a hobo.
Oh, my God. I'm so glad to see you again.
Oh, you, too, Lynnie.
Hey, Bree.
Hello, Adam.
I just dropped by to see your husband. Is he here?
he's in the exam room, readjusting the chair.
look, I'm sorry Mike is in such pain, but it's not really ethical for me to write him a prescription.
know it's a little dicey, but you'd really be doing me a big favor.
by the way, Bree looks great.
I haven't seen her since I delivered Danielle's baby.
sorry. Your baby.
Hey, Andrew.
what are you doing?
just giving you that sewing room you always wand.
you're moving out?
but you can't afford an apartment.
I can afford this one, which will give you some idea how crappy the neighborhood is.
I'm sorry. I don't--I don't understand.
why are you doing this?
I'm doing this for you.
how are you gonna get a fresh start with your past mistakes stinking up the place?
is this about the other morning?
Oh, for heaven sakes, you can't be serious.
I am. In fact, I already gave the landlord a check.
so I hope the three of you are very happy.
well, to be honest, I'm not entirely comfortable giving this to you, Mike.
pain medication only helps your symptoms.
if this is chronic, you need to be seeing a physical therapist.
you know what I need, Orson?
I need to take a few weeks off, but I can't,'cause I've got to work...for the baby, for Julie's class trip, the patio furniture and everything else Susan's got me paying for.
are you okay, Mike?
you sound a little unhappy.
no, no, I'm happy, and I don't mean to put all of this on Susan.
it's just, when I signed up for this suburb dad thing, I didn't exactly know what I was getting myself into.
no, I understand.
still, this is no way to deal with stress.
it's not about stress.
it's about the pain I've been in every day since I got hit by that car.
you mean this pain is related to your accident?
it wasn't an accident.
some son of a bitch ran me down and took off.
right.
well, I hope this helps.
Oh, Mike, you're home.
I was dreaming we were ponies.
that's nice.
go back to sleep.
Hey, that kid, um, Barrett meet by today.
what?
Yeah, he said that you owed him money for some plumbing job that he helped you on.
Yeah.
Yeah, I gotta get that to him.
he's coming back tomorrow.
don't you think he would be perfect for Julie?
Barrett, it's Delfino.
I'm only gonna say this once.
I'll get you your money, but don't ever come to my house again.
you got it?
ever.
mayor missing yes, hello.
I'd, uh, like to leave an anonymous tip about something important.
uh, do you have some kind of voice mail menu for that?
well, it's about the mayor.
Oh, I don't think he's missing.
I think he's dead.
look, that's it. We gotta go to the cops.
Carlos, please.
look, we blew it with the fingerprints, all right?
now they know someone else was with him on the boat.
they don't know that someone else was us.
it's just a matter of time.
I mean, make a list of people with a motive to kill Victor.
number one...you.
number two...you.
number three...maybe me, probably still you.
okay, if we just stay calm and stick to the story...
we tried that.
it's not working.
I'm going to the cops.
now you can either come with me or wait for them to come and get you.
fine. I'll go.
thank you.
can we at least have a drink before we go?
calm our nerves?
I mean, you can't talk to the cops the way you've been babbling to me.
I guess one drink wouldn't hurt.
you okay with tequila?
only if it's the good stuff!
Oh, I think you'll find this has a real kick.
Fairview Pharmacy
Oh, and this is the worst.
during a dissection, my anatomy lab partner squirted stomach juice in my eye.
that is so disgusting.
Oh, it was terrible.
so gross.
Hey.
what are you smiling about?
my matchmaking skills.
Julie and Barrett are really hitting it Fine.
Yeah, your friend.
I told you last night he was coming by again.
I appreciate all the pressure you're putting on me. - You're welcome.
uh, Julie, could you give us a minute?
Barrett and I have a little business to discuss.
sure. I'll just grab my jacket.
I thought I told you to stay away from my house.
but your wife invited me.
and, hey, you married into a cute family. Kudos.
here's your money.
now get out.
we were just leaving.
I'm taking Julie on a tour of my campus.
there is no way I'm letting her go anywhere with a lowlife drug dealer.
lowlife?
dude, I'm a pre-med student who's found an enterprising way to earn his way through college.
you, on the other hand, are a junkie, and I don't think you want your cute family knowing that, do you?
I'll have her home by 10: 00.
this is delicious, Mrs. Delfino. - Thank you.
Hey, you know, would you like me to pack some up for you guys to take?
this guy's a drug dealer.
what?
you remember those pills you found?
he sold them to me.
look, Mrs. Delfino... - get out of my house.
get him out of my house! - Okay.
I'll go.
it's a shame, though.
he was such a good customer.
Hey. Where' d Barrett go?
why am I so sleepy all of a sudden?
Oh, I don't know, but if you're not feeling well, maybe we should put this off.
no, no, no. We gotta go now.
crap! - What?
detectives!
any, uh, news on my husband?
not yet, but we've got some more questions for you.
Oh, okay. So ask away.
Mrs. Lang, were you having an affair with your ex-husband?
that's crazy. Where' d you hear that?
your neighbor called us.
well, you tell Edie Britt just because Carlos dumped her, doesn't mean she has to go around trashing my reputation, especially when she's the slut.
well, have you seen him lately?
boy, let me think.
no. No, I haven't, this is Lyons.
we're on our way.
good news, Mrs. Lang.
they found your husband.
a couple of fishermen found him washed up on the beach.
he's unconscious but in stable condition.
would you like to go to the hospital?
well, why wouldn't I?
just let me grab my purse.
well, you can stop feeling guilty.
Victor's alive, and we're screwed.
okay, what's the plan?
once she shows up, you'll meet her and give her the money.
then ask her to walk you back to the car.
I'll jump out, grab her, and while you open the trunk...
fine, the backseat, but you're just gonna spoil her.
I see you still have that wicked sense of humor.
Yeah.
it's the one good thing you get from a crappy childhood.
you know, I...I always regretted the way things ended.
Why? Mom cheated on you.
no one blames you for leaving.
it was, uh, more complicated than that.
Hey, I'm not complaining.
Ah, there's booze - Illa now.
all right, I'll go get her.
he bought those pills a long time ago and never got around to paying the guy.
Julie, it's not like it was heroin or crack.
it was just pain pills for his shoulder, but we had a talk, and he has totally stopped taking them.
are you absolutely sure? - Yeah.
Why?
well, I was at the drugstore this morning, and I saw Mike there, picking up a prescription.
Hello, Stella.
what the hell?
I know we're the same age.
how is it you look so much better than me?
well, I don't drink or sleep in cars - oh, so that's your secret. Who knew?
Stell, here's the money.
Thanks, doll.
you are a beautiful, beautiful human being.
you son of a bitch. You set me up.
Oh, crap!
now where do you think you're going?
I'm off to die in a ditch.
what do you care? - Okay, ought with the drama.
I want you to come home with me.
Oh, really?
that's not what you said to Lydia and Lucy.
I am sorry about that, mom. We were just venting.
people who love you need to do that.
I was not a horrible mother, and even if I was, it's old news, so drop it.
drop it?
do you hear that? She wants me to drop it.
and when she cheated on you, and when she wrecked our family, I bet she wanted you to drop that, too.
okay, guys... - what's done is done, and if you can't get over it, there's nothing I can say that'll make you stop hating me.
there is one thing you could say.
you keep your mouth shut.
Stella, she's a grown woman. She can handle it.
handle what?
Glen, don't.
I didn't leave your mother because she cheated on me.
I left because I'm gay.
mom. You okay?
just a bit dizzy from holding my breath in your stairwell.
may I come in?
Oh, I'd...I'd kind of rather you not see the place until I get it fixed up.
well, I guess I'll just have to take my veal scaloppinie and go home.
I've been so busy with moving, I forgot to eat.
this is really good, mom. - Thank you.
you know, I'd make it for you every day if you'd move back home.
mom, this...this is my home.
seriously, Andrew, you don't even have a bed.
actually, you're sitting on it. It's a foldout.
Oh, dear God. At least let me buy you some decent furniture.
absolutely not.
mom, I'm... I'm gonna do this on my own.
Andrew, I understand you're angry with me about what I said, but...
I mean, let's be honest.
you put me through hell.
you're right.
I-I know I did, but that's why I'm mad.
because I-I changed, and you never noticed.
you know, I-I got a job, a car, my own health insurance.
I'... I've turned things around.
well, I know that.
then why haven't you said anything?
it's because you've been so focused on your new husband and baby.
Oh, Andrew. - Mom, it's okay.
you know, you've got a new life, and I think it's time I did, too.
I just don't want us to part on bad terms again, like we did two years ago.
you mean when you left me on the side of that road?
look, mom...I was spinning out of control.
you forced me to grow up.
if I haven't said it before, thank you.
you forgive me?
I forgave you a long time ago.
you just...you just never noticed.
Oh, uh, mom?
uh, would you mind using a coaster?
okay. Now I...I really am gonna cry.
Dave passed away last spring.
we were together almost 20 years.
he seems nice.
I know it's a lot to deal with.
kinda.
so, uh, coffee's probably ready.
uh, cream and sugar?
shot of Bourbon?
why didn't you tell me?
it wasn't my proudest moment, Lynette.
what are you talking about?
I failed as a woman.
two years being married to me, and he turns gay.
I don't think that's how it works.
all I know is I was...so ashamed.
what does it matter anyway?
it wouldn't have changed anything between us.
are you kidding?
it would've changed everything.
Oh, y-you would've given me a pass on my drinking and my swearing, my men?
if I understood why you couldn't stay married to the only father, the only stable parent I'd ever known, yeah, I could've found a way to forgive you all sorts of things.
we can talk about this later.
let's go home.
I don't think so.
listen to me.
I would be honored if you would come and live with us.
having you around these past few months was sort of...fun.
it was great.
we actually figured out a way to stop torture each other.
then why not come back?
because I don't want to screw that up, and let's face it, Lynette.
you know I would.
so why don't we just take our chips and leave the table winners?
but where will you live?
actually, I have a thought.
uh, sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but, um...I happen to have an immaculately decorated guest room.
you know, he's always talked like that.
how did I not know you were queer?
I'm sorry. You want this around?
well, we always had a good time, and to tell the truth, I've been a little lonely lately.
so I would be doing you a favor.
fine, but I'm keeping the money.
it's a deal.
does this work for you?
it does.
it really does.
some stretches, and the shoulder feels great.
that's a relief.
you, uh, gonna take a shower? - Yeah.
I might, um, go down for a snack in a minute.
okay.
Mrs. Lang?
uh, I'm Dr. Wheeler, your husband's neurologist.
how is he?
uh, he's starting to wake up now.
would you like to talk to him?
of course!
I-I bet he's pretty delirious.
I mean, after his ordeal, I wouldn't be surprised if he's just babbling like a crazy person!
Mr. Lang, your wife is here.
Gaby. Hi.
don't strain yourself Victor.
there's plenty of time to talk later.
what's important now is that you rest.
just stay quiet and rest...
quietly.
Mr. Mayor, I'm detective Berry.
we need to ask you a few questions.
what time did you take your boat out?
I was on the boat?
we think We found it floating in the bay, and, uh, obviously, you'd been in the water for quite some time.
uh, the last thing I remember...was Friday's staff meeting. - Really?
I mean, what?
Gaby, do you remember anything about me being on the boat?
no.
no.
sorry.
I guess I don't remember anything.
not uncommon in these situations.
he's suffered both a mild concussion and hypothermia, either of which could result in memory loss.
well, who cares?
the important thing is that he's safe, and we're gonna nue you back to health, and I think that would happen a lot faster if we all clear out. Thank you.
Gaby, can you stay with me for a little while? - Of course.
sounds like I was in pretty bad shape there.
but you're okay now. That's the important thing.
come here.
I remember everything.
what?
I think I will rest now.
I'm gonna need all my strength.
the past is never truly behind us.
ghosts lurk in the shadows, eager to remind us of the choices we made.
but if we look back, we might find an old friend with open arms or an old enemy with a hidden agenda. Or a grown-up son with a forgiving heart.
sadly, some of us refuse to look back, never understanding that by denying the past...we are condemned to repeat it.
Fairview Pharmacy Orson Hodge Dos
five kids are tough enough, but your husband makes six, and that's where I draw the line.
an old friend paid Adam a visit.
aren't you gonna invite me in?
after you ruined my life?
I don't think so.
you should've told the truth about us.
Mike got help...from an unexpected source.
Victor Crashed out...
come on! Get up!
and Carlos and Gaby...
we need to ask you a few questions.
sorry. I guess I don't remember anything.
finally met their match.
I remember everything.
it was supposed to be a beautiful day.
kids should have been playing in the park.
husbands should have been doing their chores.
women should have been tending their flowers.
but at 2: 26 that afternoon, a tornado came to Wisteria Lane...
bringing with it...unbelievable...destruction.
no one could have anticipated it...
especially given how the day started.
sorry. Can you say that again?
I don't think I heard you right.
Carlos and I are back together.
Gaby, you just got married.
and some of us gave you very expensive wedding gifts.
uh, you want the fondue set back? Fine.
but don't act like it cost a bundle, 'cause it clearly didn't.
I got you the fondue set.
Oh. Right. It's nice.
Oh, my god. This is gonna kill Edie.
you would think so, but no such luck.
that vindictive hag told Victor everything.
Victor knows?
Yeah, and seeing how he's the rich mayor of a small town with various thugs and cops at his dposal, Carlos and I thought it would be safer if we got the heck out of dodge.
you're leaving Fairview?
Yeah. This afternoon.
no.
you can't be serious.
look, we'll be back... someday.
we just have to wait till this all blows over.
I can't believe this.
I know. This is... a lousy way to say good-bye.
and I'm sorry, but I don't have a choice.
do you guys have any idea how much I'm gonna miss you?
Hey, you heard the news?
a tornado just hit Mount Pleasant, and they think we could get one, too.
y'all better head inside and start getting ready.
um, go. You guys go.
Yeah, and--and we don't need to say good-bye anyway, 'cause we're gonna see you real soon.
and everything will be just the way it was.
sadly, this was not to be.
in four short hours, one of these women would lose a husband, and all of them would lose a friend.
but how could they have known this?
it was supposed to be a beautiful day.
by noon that day, a tornado watch was in effect on Wisteria Lane, and every one of its residents was preparing for the storm -
everyone, that is, except Gabrielle Solis, who was more concerned about another storm on the horizon.
mayor Lang, recovering from his injuries, will reportedly be released from the hospital tomorrow.
until then, the deputy mayor will be coordinating fairview's emergency response as the city remains on tornado watch. It has been over 50 years...
I turned off the gas and locked your car in the garage.
I'm gonna go gramy passport from the safe-deposit box before they close the bank.
what's wrong?
they said Victor's getting out of the hospital... tomorrow.
relax. We're gonna be gone before they give him his last sponge bath.
and remember, the accountant's dropping off the papers for my Cayman Island account.
I can't deal with that right now. I'm packing.
Gaby, those documents give us access to $10 million. Multitask.
I told you just to pack the essentials.
that's what I'm doing.
is that a boa?
Carlos, if you are taking me somewhere where I don't need a boa, then I don't want to go.
fine.
you could be a little bit more sensitive.
I had to say good-bye to my friends today.
Yes, I'm sorry.
and I should probably go over and say something to Edie.
like what?
rot in hell, you maggoty whore?
that woman ruined our lives.
if she had kept her mouth shut, we wouldn't be running away.
I know, but I can't help feeling a little guilty.
I mean, do you ever even think about what we did to Edie?
who cares?!
thanks to her, I'm giving up my home, my friends, half my wardrobe.
so do me a favor and never mention her name again unless it's followed by the phrase, "that conniving skank."
you think you can do that?
Hey, Lynette.
Hi. Did you hear they declared a tornado watch?
scary, huh?
Yeah, well, don't worry about me.
I'm ready for anything.
it's sweet of you to drop by, though.
Oh, yeah. Well, you're welcome.
okay.
um... can we stay in your basement?
what?
well, if this tornado watch gets upgraded to a warning, we're gonna need a place to wait it out.
who exactly is "we"?
"We"--me, Tom, the kids.
that family you've come to know and love.
all seven of you?
Yeah.
well, first of all, I only love four of you.
and second, no way in hell.
Mrs. Mccluskey, please?
it's a small basement, Lynette.
I've already invited Ida over.
we just wanna play some cards and wait this thing out in peace and quiet.
we can be quiet... relative to the storm.
look, there's a shelter over at 3rd and grove.
why don't you go over there?
that's in the middle of skid row.
you think I want my kids around a bunch of winos?
Ida's off the wagon.
it's not gonna be much better here.
I am asking you as a friend. Please?
you're not gonna let this thing go, are you?
Thanks. And don't worry.
I'll have a talk with my kids.
I promise they'll keep a lid on the destruction.
relative to the storm.
Yeah.
Dylan, we're fine.
it's just a tornado watch.
no. We paid a lot of money for this class trip, and I want you to stay and enjoy it.
tell Julie I'll keep an eye on her mom.
gotta go.
what the hell are you doing here?
I just came to talk to Adam.
I like your hair long.
this is harassment.
I will call the police.
I don't think so.
you'd have to tell them what happened with me and your husband.
you don't want people knowing about that.
in case you'd forgotten, Adam wants nothing to do with you.
Oh?
didn't seem that way yesterday.
he didn't tell you I stopped by?
I hope he's not starting to keep things from you...again.
here. I brought you a few things in case there is a tornado.
tape, batteries, a radio.
how'd you know I need this stuff?
an educated guess.
Hey, actually, um, since you're here,
I was thinking that maybe it would be a good idea to tell Orson about Mike's, you know... drug problem.
good, because I already...told him.
you did? When?
last week.
I was afraid that Mike might go to Orson for pills.
I'm sorry, so... Orson already knows about mike?
did I do something wrong?
no. No, you didn't do anything wrong.
thanks for the supplies.
I don't believe a word you say.
so you still don't think I slept with Adam?
of course not.
Oh, well, let me paint a picture for you.
me lying in his arms, him wondering out loud how he ended up marrying such a cold, hard bitch.
Katherine, are you all right?
I-I couldn't help noticing.
of course you couldn't.
and everything's fine.
thank you.
hi there. I-I don't mean to intrude, but are you all right?
not really, no.
would you like a nice cup of tea?
the National Weather Service has extended the tornado watch to the tri-county area.
funnel clouds have been spotted in the counties of Mansfield and Webster...
I can't believe you're being so nice.
you don't even know me.
well, I know Katherine, and believe me, you're not the only person I've seen her reduce to tears.
did you see her spit on me?
Yes. That was unfortunate.
if you need any antibacterial soap, I
Nah, I'm good.
so, um, why on earth would Katherine treat you so dreadfully?
Oh, she's just mad 'cause her husband's in love with me.
Really?
I was one of his patients back in Chicago.
from the moment we met, there was this intense passion.
we tried to fight it, but we couldn't.
well, you're only human.
I know he's miserable without me, even though she tries to pretend that they're happy.
I mean, you're their neighbor.
you think they're happy?
well, they seem... content.
well, they're not.
it was just an observation.
Yeah, a stupid one.
okay.
this has been... lovely.
we really should, um, do it again sometime.
you think I'm making this up?
we were lovers.
I can prove it.
he has a snake tattoo on his right shoulder.
I licked it.
be that as it may, I really think you should go now.
no one believes me!
she has you all brainwashed!
Sylvia, where are you going?
Sylvia, you need to come out of there.
ask Adam! He'll tell you the truth!
well, Adam is not here, and there is a tornado coming.
and as you may have gleaned from the batteries and bottled water, that bathroom is where we are planning on riding it out.
so would you please be a dear and come on out?
go get Adam!
and... open wide.
Orson, we need to talk.
Susan. I'm with a patient.
Yeah, I can see that.
Hi. I'm his neighbor. Cute shoes.
why the hell would you give Mike drugs?
uh... Mrs. Kowalsky...
we're gonna step out for just a moment.
no need. I'll be quick.
cause I'm sure you have a very good reason for giving mike pills when you know that he has a drug problem.
so... what is your very good reason?
okay, this may take a while.
you might want to spit.
Mike was having a lot of pain with his shoulder.
Oh, of course, and you know all about shoulder pain...being a dentist.
I thought I was helping.
by giving pills to an addict?
does that sound helpful to you, Mrs. Kowalsky?
thank you.
finally, some sanity.
Susan, you have to leave.
fine.
but you know, if I find ou that you have given Mike so much as a breath mint, trust me, there is not enough novocaine in this office to numb the pain I will inflict on you.
Hi, miss Britt.
you need some bottled water before the storm hits?
well, thanks, Jeremy.
20 bucks.
hold it.
you are price gouging right before a tornado?
I was just trying to make so money.
you really wanna make some money?
go hit up Gabrielle Solis.
she hasn't met a price tag she didn't like.
I already tried.
she and Mr. Solis are moving.
moving?
Yeah. They're loading up their car and everything.
they didn't tell you?
well, they probably didn't want a big emotional scene.
too bad.
see me Susan what was I supposed to do, Mike?
leave 'em in your truck?
I'm not gonna sit back and watch you spin out of control.
out of control?
have I ever missed a mortgage payment? - What?
or disappeared for days on end, or O.D.D in an alley?
no. I go to work every day.
I help out around the house.
I take care of you and Julie.
what's the problem?
what's the problem?
let's see. You lied to me.
uh, your drug dealer almost dated my daughter.
you lied to me some more, and then I find out that you hit up my best friend's husband for more pills.
you're blowing this out of proportion.
and you're kind of yelling at me--also a problem.
I'm sorry.
I'm in pain.
you might think you have things under control, but they're only gonna get worse...
and with a baby on the way.
I'm sick of explaining myself.
if I need a pill now and then, I'll take one.
so where are they?
I'm serious, Susan.
give 'em to me.
forget it.
Hey, don't walk away from me! Susan!
let go of me!
touching down outside Mount Pleasant.
we can confirm 6 dead and more than 200 injured, with the total only expected to rise...
my wife needs to be seen immediately.
she's pregnant. She fell down the stairs.
any bleeding?
uh, no.
cramping?
uh, I think I just twisted my ankle, but I would like to get checked out anyway.
sure, but for non-emergency cases, it's gonna be a long wait.
well, she's pregnant. Doesn't that make it an emergency?
sir, I'm sorry. You're just gonna have to wait.
it's okay.
how could you not have told me Sylvia was here?
I was trying not to upset you.
well, you failed.
at least if you had warned me,
I wouldn't have been blindsided when she showed up on our front lawn.
I'm sorry.
look, I'll call the police.
I'll get a restraining order.
I'll do whatever it takes to get this woman out of our lives.
Bree. Hello.
Hi, Katherine.
could I borrow Adam for a second?
I have a... situation on my hands.
she's over there, first door on the left, and please hurry.
what is she doing there in the first place?
I saw her weeping. I wanted to help.
you wanted dirt, and I'll bet she told you plenty.
I can't help having a sympathetic face.
I need you to come out here, okay?
is that you, darling?
don't call him that!
I'm not coming out if she's here!
I'm not leaving you alone with my husband.
just come out!
I'll get rid of her!
ladies.
so what'd she tell you?
that she had an affair with Adam.
well, she didn't.
she was his patient-- a pathetic, lonely woman.
one day, for no other reason than sheer pity, he gave her a little kiss.
Sylvia took this to mean that they were in love.
and when Adam told her otherwise, she had a breakdown and accused him of sexual assault.
Oh, my god.
what did you do?
we settled out of court.
I wanted to fight it, but Adam was afraid of losing his license.
of course, we lost everything else-- our home, our...savings and our friends.
so this is why you moved back to Fairview?
it was supposed to be our fresh start.
so... now you know our dirty little secret.
well, Katherine, for what it's worth...
I would've spit in her face, too.
what's that noise?
is... is that the tornado?
worse. It's the Scavos.
Hey, we're here!
I know!
all right, guys. Come on. Stake out your places.
this our spot! We called it!
you can't call a spot this soon!
can so!
ow, my head!
Lynette? I'm begging.
Oh. Sorry. Kinda get used to it.
come here. Give that to mama.
Hey, guys?
come on now.
knock it off.
here you go.
and... first base, second base, third base, sit.
we gonna have a nicequiet tornado watch, and nobody's gonna cause any problems.
is there a cat here?
Oh, yes. I brought Toby.
is something wrong?
I didn't realize there'd be a cat.
Tom's really allergic.
it sets off my asthma.
Ida, is there any chance that we could put little Toby upstairs?
upstairs?
Yeah. He'd be very safe.
we could put him in a closet.
sure.
why don't we put Penny with him, since it's safe?
what?
Toby is Ida's baby, Lynette.
no, Toby's an animal, and my husband, a human being, will get very sick if he stays down here, so, please, put the cat upstairs.
look, I invited Ida to come here.
you, I'm doing a favor for.
if you're not happy with the accommodations, you're free to leave.
Hey, I'll just stay over here.
may--maybe it won't get any worse.
no, that's ridiculous.
Karen, come on.
sorry. The cat stays.
knock yourself out.
start him on I.V.
are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just worried about you.
how long are they gonna keep us waitin?
are you sure that's all it is?
Hey! Hey, we were here way before these people.
sir, they're seeing everyone on an emergency basis.
this woman is hemorrhaging.
Danny, can you take her in?
what, you gotta see blood before you'll treat somebody?
my wife's pregnant, and she fell down a flight of stairs.
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you to be patient.
these people are bleeding.
I can absolutely wait.
I'm just asking them to take a look at you, okay?
hell, you could've done it while you're standing here talking to me, right?
sir, we'll get to your wife as soon as we can.
now please take a seat.
just take a look at her!
get the hell off of me!
Mike, stop!
I need security here now.
Dr. Roth, blood lab 7.
Dr. Roth, blood lab 7.
Hey.
when you gonna let me out of these things?
when your wife's done and you're ready to go home.
the doctor said the baby's fine.
Oh, thank god.
and, uh, your ankle?
just a mild sprain.
how you doing?
I've had better days.
I am so sorry.
it's gonna be okay.
I talked to the doctor, and, um, they have a rehab facility they work with.
Thanks.
I don't need rehab.
I can kick this myself.
I've done it before.
you keep saying that, and it just keeps getting worse.
Susan, look at me.
I'm handcuffed to a chair.
I think I've hit bottom here.
I will fix this.
just no rehab.
Mrs. Delfino?
the doctor asked me to give you these, for the pain.
Oh, my god. Are you kidding me?
I've kind of had a rough day here.
no.
I've just gotta get through is.
no.
there's no tomorrow.
it's now.
you will quit this now.
you will go to rehab, or so help me, I will leave you.
I will take this baby, and I will leave you.
you win.
I'll go.
Excusee?
sorry. I'm in a rush.
my wife's alone with the kids, and I have to get home before the storm hits.
this is the information Carlos asked for.
about what?
about the Cayman Island account.
didn't he tell you I was coming?
Yeah, of course he did.
uh, he said you'd be stopping by.
Duh.
this is everything you need to access the money.
I washed my hands of this, so whatever you do, don't lose that folder. Got it?
believe me, I won't let it out of my sight.
all right. Nice to finally meet you, Gabrielle.
you're just as pretty as Carlos said you were.
Oh, no. I'm prettier.
Edie, what have you got there?!
Oh, crap!
residents are advised to seek shelter at once.
again, do not evacuate.
stay where you are and seek shelter in a basement or any windowless room.
you okay?
my throat is closing up.
I think I gotta go upstairs.
no. No, no, no, no, no.
you stay here.
Edie, you thief! Open this door now!
I've called the police!
they're on their way, and they are going to taser your ass!
Oh, good. You're home.
what the hell did I tell you?!
I'm not gonna sit and watch my husband suffocate.
well, I don't want Ida to wake up and find her cat missing.
Karen, after all our years of friendship, how can you choose a cat over my husband?
you think we're friends?
of course.
Really?
you ever stop by just to say hi or invite me for a cup of tea?
Ida does.
what are you talking about?
I had you over for lemonade last week.
while I was drinking it, you went to the store, and I watched the kids face it. The only time we're friends is when you need something.
that is not true.
I genuinely care about you.
you mean like today, when you came by to check on me?
Oh, that's right, you only wanted a basement, oh!
damn it, Toby! - Hey, hold it! Hold it!
you can't go out there!
that stupid cat is the only family that Ida's got!
now this is what friends do!
give me the damn folder, Edie!
not gonna happen!
it's worthless to you!
you and Carlos are screwed without it, and that is worth a lot to me.
give me my money!
your money?
Carlos embezzled it.
Oh, now you're moral all of a sudden?
you didn't care where the money was coming from when you thought Carlos was gonna spend it on you!
okay, I'm not unreasonable.
cut me in for, say, 60%, and I'll go away.
how's that sound?
No!
get you!
Edie! - Give me that!
No!
let go! - No, you!
let go! - You!
No! No!
what did you do?!
what did you do, Edie?!
get in the house.
now!
you gotta get inside now! - He's right there!
damn it! I'm not gonna let you die, so don't make me drag you!
Oh, crap.
Oh! Hurry! Go!
come on!
get in!
I have a crawl space.
I think we can both fit.
you just threw my money in a tornado.
I am not getting in there with you.
fine! Then stay out there and die.
move your ass!
come on, Sylvia.
please open the door.
thank god you're here. We need to get into the bathroom.
we can't. There's a woman in there.
well, tell her to hurry it up.
no, no, no, she's barricaded herself in there.
she's a patient of mine who's had a little meltdown.
just give me five minutes.
we don't have time.
there's a funnel cloud out there.
open the damn door! - Go to hell!
quick! In here, in here.
come on! - Hurry up!
get in, get in!
get in!
hang on! Hang onto this!
can I say something?
what?
I'm sorry Carlos and I lied to you.
I know we hurt you, and I wish it didn't happen the way it did, and I-I just want you to know that.
why are you talking like that?
well, I thought just in case we... - Oh, no, you don't.
you just shut the hell up.
we're not doing deathbed confessions here.
we're gonna get through this.
I'm gonna go on hating you for years to come.
you really hate me?
Yes.
no.
it's just that I really let myself fall for him, which was stupid because I always knew that he'd go back to you.
well, I'm still sorry, though.
I said shut the hell up.
I think it's possible Benjamin might need changing.
that went beyond the hypothetical a good ten minutes ago.
we're giving you shelter. You could at least be gracious.
we wouldn't need shelter if you hadn't dragged us over here.
Oh, so now it's my fault that that lunatic commandeered our safe room?
if you hadn't been dying to know our business, she wouldn't have gotten in there.
can we stop pointing fingers?
this isn't Bree's fault.
you're right.
sorry.
but you can understand why I'm upset, having that insane woman back in our lives.
I can only imagine. I had to listen to her babble for an hour.
what kind of things was she saying?
she said that she and Adam were lovers and she could prove it because he had a tattoo, and...
what?
she said he had a tattoo on his shoulder, which I know isn't true because I've seen him at the pool, and I would've remembered because tattooed people make me very uncomfortable.
did she say what kind of tattoo it was?
a snake. What's the difference? He doesn't have one.
he did...
back in Chicago.
he had it removed.
sorry.
Katherine... - So...
that's why we settled?
why we lost everything?
I'm sorry, but you have to understand... - No, I do not.
sorry.
not here.
not now.
change of plans!
we gotta get in the basement now!
damn it. Where are you?
Where's Gaby?
I thought she was with you.
I don't know where she is.
I guess we'll have to wait for her together.
do you mind if I say something?
look, Gaby and I never planned to get back together, Victor.
we tried to keep away from each other.
we really did.
I don't know. It's like we're two halves of the same person or somethin'.
and when we're apart, We...
we just aren't happy, which is why we...
we never set out to hurt you, Victor, and I'm sorry we did.
are you done?
Yeah.
come on, Carlos!
you better get in the house!
you could get hurt out here!
Hello!
where is everyone?!
did you hear that?
Adam, I'm leaving!
this is your last chance to come with me, or I'm gonna tell everyone exactly what happened!
okay.
you've made your choice!
here I go!
it's here.
it was supposed to be a beautiful day.
but then the winds came and changed everything...
and not just the houses and the lawns.
Oh, my god.
the people had changed, too.
while the storm had raged, each of them had learned something...
about friendship...
and forgiveness...
and redemption.
and some had learned the hardest lesson of all...
that life is always fragile and very often...unfair.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
help me!
help me, Tom!
Dylan and Katherine raised their profile and attracted the attention of an unwanted admirer.
Mike made a surprising request...
do you think you can forgive me?
which brought Orson's guilt to the surface.
I'm sorry, Mike.
Oh, you're sleepwalking.
I'm sorry I ran you over, Mike.
Gaby was learning to deal with Carlos being blind...
I'm sorry for what I'm putting you through.
if it for anyone but you, it wouldn't be worth it.
and Lynette worried...
it's Rick's place-- totally went up in flames.
that jealousy could drive Tom to an act of violence.
the thing you have to know about Lynette Scavo is that she had always trusted her husband Tom, mostly because she could always tell when he was lying.
sometimes he would ask her to repeat the question...
did I eat... your ice cream? Is that what you're asking?
or he would use odd words he had never used before...
Oh, I think it looks... spiffy.
or his voice would get higher...
I guess she's pretty. I mean... I didn't really notice.
clearly, Tom Scavo was at a distinct disadvantage when lying to his wife.
and on this particular morning, that's exactly what Lynette ARSON SUSPECTED IN RESTAURANT FIRE was unting on.
whatcha doing?
I am onesing for a cup of coffee, but the stupid burner is acting up again.
need a little caffeine fix?
big-time.
too much booze last night. I'm really draggin'.
the open bar is no longer your friend, huh?
guess not.
but they were pouring top-shelf stuff, and I couldn't resist.
is that where you were during Bree's acceptance speech-- doing free shots at the bar?
no. Uh, I think that's when I snuck out to the car to listen to the game.
you go alone?
well, I would've invited carlos, except...
obviously, he can't really sneak around anymore, so...
Yeah.
I was thinkin', if anyone asks about that fire at Rick's, it'd be good if you had someone to account for where you were.
why would it matter?
I didn't start the fire.
right, right. It's just...
if anyone thinks you did, it'd be handy if y could prove them wrong, wouldn't it?
you think I did it. - No.
one stupid brick, and now I'm an arsonist?
no, no. Of course not.
it's just, if the police came here to ask us about the brick, they're probably gonna ask us about the fire, so you might wanna be ready.
listen to me, Lynette. As mad as I have been at rick,
I had absolutely nothing to do with this fire. We're fine.
okay. - Good.
Lynette Scavo had always trusted her husband.
she had no idea that trust was about to go up in flames.
keep OFF THE GRASS!
everyone breaks the rules now and again, and when they do, they always haven excuse...
like the neighbor whose own trash was already full...
or the blonde who forgot to eat her breakfast...
or the employee who needed an advance on his salary...
it's true-- everyone has a reason for not following the rules...
even the people who are meant to enforce them.
cense and registration, please.
well, what did I do? I wasn't speeding.
there's a construction zone back there. You failed to slow down.
are you sure? I didn't see a sign or anything.
you wanna step out of the car, please?
you're not gonna give me a ticket, are you? My mom will kill me.
where do you go to school?
Fairview High.
pretty necklace. - Oh, thanks.
listen, I'm really sorry about the construction zone.
I would have slowed down if I had seen the sign, I swear.
I'll tell you what.
I'll let you go with a warning.
just pay more attention next time, okay?
thank you. That's very nice of you. Thank you.
that's everything, I guess.
well, if you forgot something, you can just come back for it, or...
you could just not leave.
Oh, that's so sweet, but...
our house is livable again-- the downstairs anyway-- and we have imposed long enough.
besides, Mike is coming home tonight, and you're gonna need the house to yourselves.
well, before you go, I just want to say that, um...
having you here these last few weeks
Susan, I'm just going across the street.
there's no need to act like a silent movie heroine.
I know. I just... I can't stop now.
I broke the seal.
well, um, as much as I appreciate this naked display of emotion, you know how this sort of thing makes me uncomfortable.
I can't help it. My hormones are in overdrive.
didn't you get that way when you were pregnant?
no. Never.
ally?
not even when you heard an acoustic guitar?
no. Never.
Oh, I just can't control myself like that.
Oh, sure, you can.
whenever I feel my emotions getting the best of me,
I simply picture an empty box, and I take whatever I'm feeling and put that in the box, and then I picture myself putting the box away in a big, empty closet and closing the door.
then if I have time, I go back and open the box and deal with the emotion...
in private, like a lady.
Thanks.
I'm gonna try that.
so you don't think I act like a lady?
prove me wrong, sweetie. Prove me wrong.
all right. Come on, girl.
okay, Carlos, here's the harness.
there you are!
Oh, you must be Roxy!
aren't you the cutest thing!
okay, not too close. It's silk.
Gaby, this is Steve. He's the head trainer at the dog school.
Ah, nice to meet you.
Carlos told me how much he enjoyed taking classes with Roxy.
well, they make a great team.
well, I have got a million questions about this little lifesaver here.
okay, shoot.
okay, hypothetical situation-- Carlos and I are sitting on the couch.
I'm doing my nails. He's whining for the remote.
how do I get Roxy to fetch it for him?
she's serious.
Roxy doesn't do that.
um, her job is to get Carlos from point "a" to point "b" as safely as possible.
I get that, but surely she's trained to do other stuff, you know, like find his keys or turn off the radio or lick up his spills.
Yeah, and after that, she can go solve crimes with shaggy and the gang.
don't ve me your blind sarcasm.
I saw a collie on tv who could push a lawn mower.
do you have one of those?
Gaby, Roxy's fantastic.
Really? Well, for a dog who's supposed to help us, she sounds kind of limited.
sorry, but it's true.
she's not here to help us.
she's here to help me, which you would know if you had bothered to show up to the spouses' orientation.
well, I'm sorry. I was on my hands and knees that day, scouring the bathroom floor because you fused to pee like a girl.
so... any other questions?
no, it's crystal clear.
Carlos gets a new best friend, and I get to check the sofa for ticks.
yay for Gaby!
did I exaggerate?
actually, you were kind oh, it feels good to take a shower in my own house. At you doing?
in honor of you coming home, we are making your favorite meal-- steak and mashed potatoes.
Oh, that sounds great.
for future reference, my favorite is potatoes au gratin.
since when?
since always. Since I was 3.
you could say "au gratin" when you were 3?
Oh, it's fine. Susan, mashed is great, too.
it's not your favorite?
what are you doing?
excuse me. I have to put something in a box and stick it in the closet.
hormones.
got it.
pretty much anything sets her off these days.
uh, which is why I haven't told her...
told her what? Something wrong?
well, when Bree and Orson were staying with us, this weird thing happened.
Oh, yeah. Naked Orson? I heard.
must have been quite a show.
no, this was the next night.
he was sleepwalking, and he said something kinda strange.
but like I said, he was asleep, so it's probably nothing.
Julie, what'd he say?
he said... "I'm sorry I ran over Mike."
what? - It's crazy, right?
why would he say something like that?
he didn't even know you when that happened.
Yeah, you're right. It's crazy.
Yeah, that's what I figured.
okay, well, I'm gonna go check on mom and make sure she's okay.
we don't need any more drama in this house.
Yeah, I agree.
how's the move going?
need an extra pair of hands?
no, thanks. We're almost done.
okay, well, I won't get in your way then.
let me just run something by you.
I got a call today from a couple who loved our work on the founder's ball.
Oh, how sweet.
Yes, and they want to hire us to do their anniversary party.
hire us? But we're not a business.
we could be. Think about it.
we do the exact same thing we did at the ball, only this time, we walk away with a big, fat check.
Katherine, need I remind you we nearly came to blows over floral choices?
I think it's our creative friction that makes us a great team.
I think it's our creative friction that nearly caused me to poison you.
all right, look, Bree, I'm gonna be honest with you.
with Adam out of the house, I really need the money.
I sympathize. I do, but I have a new baby, and it's really more work than I care to take on right now.
I understand.
guess I'll just do it myself then. - Excuse me?
now did you take pictures of those table settings you designed?
I'd love to get copies. The couple raved about them.
Yeah, sure.
you know, I don't really think it's fair that you should profit from something that I designed.
you're right. It would only be fair if I asked you to do this with me, which I did, and you said no. So on we go.
I hope you don't mind if I serve your cinnamon apple crumble.
that is a cherished recipe from my grandmother.
well, w it's a cherished recipe from catering by Katherine.
Oh, I see what's going on here.
this is shameless emotional blackmail.
And?
and... it worked beautifully. I'm in.
no more doggy treats. She's had enough.
but she's been so good.
yeah? Well, when she learns how to make granite sparkle, she can have more.
I'm giving her a treat.
Carlos, I said no.
fine. One treat.
that's it. Those things are expensive, and until your disability kicks in, we have to tighten our belts.
so I guess that means you won't be getting your hair done anymore.
Carlos, remember what my fingers look like?
just picture the middle one all by itself.
besides, you're the one who married me for my looks.
well, I'm blind now, so as long as you use deodorant, I'm good.
do you have any idea how selfish you sound right now?
just because you're blind, the world should suffer?
I'm just saying, you know, $300 visits to Mr. Francois
Carlos, I'm getting my hair done! End of discussion!
what are you barking at? You got your damn treat.
you know, if we really want to save money, you could cut down on those cuban cigars.
or... here's a thought.
you could get a job.
why don't you get a job? - Doing what?
put flags on pencils and sell them at the airport.
what do I care? Just get out of my kitchen.
what is this about? - I don't know.
I guess she doesn't like it when you smack me.
Oh, so now I can't hit my own husband in my own house?
look, we can cut corners all you want, but I am not gonna skimp when it comes to my dog.
Roxy, come.
Hey, neighbor. - Oh, mike.
welcome back. You're looking well.
Yeah, well, you know me. Indestructible.
what you looking for? - A hammer.
we're putting some of the pictures back up.
this it?
Thanks, buddy.
you got a minute?
uh, actually, uh, Bree's waiting-- waiting for me.
you said something to Julie when you were sleepwalking.
I did?
Yeah, and I need you to clear it up.
are you the guy that ran me over?
I'm so sorry.
I'm so...
no way.
that mutt is not sleeping in our bed!
she's clean. It's okay.
no. No, it's not.
I read the pamphlet Steve left.
these dogs are not allowed on furniture.
I know. I...
I just think it's good for a dog to sleep with its master. It helps us bond.
well, if you ever want to bond with my boobs again, you'll get her off!
you're being selfish.
we can put her at the foot of the bed.
Carlos, no!
she doesn't like it when you yell at me, remember?
you're right, baby. I'm sorry.
let me try it this way.
you listen to me, you blind son of a bitch.
if you don't get this mangy, 6-nippled, cujo wannabe off my satin sheets, you n't just need a dog to get around.
you'll need a motorized wheelchair that you steer with your tongue.
Really?
Carlos, I mean it.
who's it gonna be -- me or the dog?
maternity lingerie -- ah, right.
why don't they just call it what it really is?
a pup tent to hide your stretch marks.
Oh, actually, if it's okay, I'm really not in the mood right now. I'm sorry.
I understand. - Thanks.
you just don't want to be crushed under the weight of a repulsive cow.
that is not it. - No, I get it.
really, I knew this day was coming.
I just didn't know it would be a day when I was so horny.
honey, I still find you incredibly sexy.
it's me. I...
I just got a lot on my mind right now.
what's going on?
I found out something today.
I didn't want to tell you, but...
well, you can tell me anything.
that's what we talked about in all those sessions with the doctor.
you're right.
but if I tell you, you have to promise to let me handle this my own way.
who could that be at this hour?
what on earth?
you are never to come near my family ever again!
do you understand? - What are you talking about?
do you hear me, Orson?
damn it. Susan, I-- I told you to let me handle this.
will someone please tell me wh's going on?
so you don't know that your husband tried to kill Mike?
what?
look, I explained this to Mike. I panicked. I was trying
trying to protect your mother? I know. Who cares?
you drove the car, you ran him over, and you left him for dead!
Susan, let's go.
and the worst part...
all this time, you pretended to be our friend.
if there was one thing Gabrielle Solis would not tolerate, it was a rival, whether she walked onwo legs... or four.
so when Gabrielle crept into her bedroom that morning, she'd made up her mind...
the bitch had to go.
Roxy... look what I've got.
come on. Come on.
okay, yes
okay, let's go.
let's go, Roxy. Let's go, Roxy. Let's go.
let's go in the car.
hey there, Dylan.
don't you remember me? I'm the cop who didn't give you a ticket yesterday.
um, yeah, I remember.
would it be okay if I sat down?
I just want to have a little chat with you.
Why?
don't worry. You're not in trouble.
actually, I can't stay.
I'm meeting my friend Julie at the mall, so I
look, I'm--I'm not trying to scare you. I just...
I just want to talk.
talk about what?
how's your mom doing?
you know my mom?
Oh, yeah.
look, a couple of days ago, I saw a picture of you and Kathy in the paper, and I did a background check, and I found out that you're living back at your aunt's place.
when you left yesterday, I was parked down the street.
you followed me?
so when you pulled me over, that was-- - I lied to you.
you weren't speeding. I'm sorry.
I just had to meet you.
who are you?
I'm Wayne Davis.
I'm your father.
Oh, Roxy, this way.
uh, Mrs. Solis, what are you doing here?
uh, I'm bringing Roxy back.
uh, what?
shame, isn't it?
I mean, I personally adored the little angel, but she and Carlos just did not get along.
Really?
well, sorry it didn't work out.
I gotta run.
uh, tell Carlos I'll call him about another dog.
Oh, well, actually, we found one.
from where?
we're the only guide dog school in the area.
well, that's it.
it's not a dog.
we got him a seeing...eye...monkey.
he's amazing.
not only can he call 9-1-1, he can toast a bagel.
Bye.
Roxy, what the heck happened back there?
Roxy, stop!
Gaby, where were you? Where's Roxy?
Oh, Carlos, I'm afraid I have some bad news.
what? At happened?
well, you know how you like it when I read you the box scores?
when I went out to get the paper-- ly thinking of making you happy
Gaby, where's my dog?
she ran away.
when I opened the door, she saw a squirrel, and she took off.
she's gone? Well, you gotta go find her.
where do you think I've been?
there's no sign of her anywhere.
Yeah, I'm sure you looked really, really hard.
how dare you.
I have looked from one end of town to the other, and I'm telling you, she's nowhere to be found.
but since you love her so much, I'm gonna keep looking.
was that Roxy?
I'm not sure.
why don't I go look?
no. It's the Scavo dog...
way down in their yard.
I guess it's true-- lose one sense, all the others get heightened.
okay, you get that.
I'm gonna go find your dog.
come on, you stupid mutt.
Gaby, you still here?
Yeah, still no sign of Roxy.
but don't worry.
I'm on the case.
that was Steve from the guide dog place.
you want a piece of pie or somethin'?
Yeah, I'm not hungry either.
I don't know what to say to you.
you don't have to say anything.
I'm having a good time just looking at you.
you have my nose.
bet you didn't know that, right?
my mom says we left because you used to beat her.
is that true?
Yeah, I hit her a couple times.
so you admit it?
what, did you think I was gonna lie and tell you that I was a great husband?
cause I wasn't.
but you gotta know, there's two sides to every story, and I swear to god, your mom gave as good as she got.
I mean, you believe me, right?
I don't know.
you know what? This was a mistake.
I should go.
go? We just got here.
look, I didn't track you down to cause any problem
I only wanted to make sure that your mom raised you properly, and now I see that she did.
I mean, you're...
you're spectacular.
that's what I needed...to know that you're okay and...
that a little part of you looks just like me.
how can you just walk away?
cause I'm not the same jerk I used to be.
sure, I'd like to have a relationship with you, but if your mom is still scared of me after all these years, uh...
no.
I don't want to upset her again.
I don't have to tell her.
what?
she doesn't have to know that I saw you.
Oh, that's...
I don't know about that.
it's just that I have so many questions, and...
I don't think we'd be hurting anybody if we just sat and talked for a while.
and we'd keep this from your mom?
sure.
Well...okay.
darlin', bring me back that dessert menu.
I wanna have a slice of pie with my daughter.
uh, I think we might be out of candles.
I don't think so. Check under the bar.
how's it goin'?
how's it goin'"?
it's goin' pretty bad.
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry. I'm sorry
sorry for your troubles.
Oh, that's touching, man.
Thanks.
so did you just come here to bust my hump, or is there something I can help you with?
actually, you can help me.
you can help me figure out what the hell these were doing by the back door of my torched restaurant.
how should I know?
so that's how you're gonna play this?
uh, no candles here.
I'm--I'm gonna go check in the back.
great.
look, I can see you're upset, pal, but I'm not the guy you're looking for.
you know I respect you...
Hey, Andrew. What do you need?
uh, I'm looking for candles, and--and that guy Rick's here.
Oh, my god!
stop it!
what are you doing? Stop.
Hey, easy. Easy.
just stop it!
are you okay?
Yeah.
Andrew, do something!
do something!
stop it!
stop!
Oh, for god sakes, what is the matter with you?
what are you, 12 years old?
stop it.
jeez.
so when are you guys gonna finish grilling my husband?
it won't be much longer, ma'am.
you know, in spite of everything that's happened, it's really good to see you again.
it makes me realize how much I miss you.
if you insist on questioning my husband about a crime he didn't commit, you should at least have all the facts.
okay.
you've got my attention.
well, for starters, Mr. Coletti opened his restaurant to get back at me because I wouldn't have an affair with him.
honey.
Oh, so you're saying your husband had two motives for setting the fire?
no.
I am saying that if anyone had an ax to grind, it's Rick.
maybe he set the fire himself so he could blame my husband.
I was at the gym.
you can call my trainer.
and Tom was at the founder's ball with me.
we have witnesses that say he disappeared for a while.
I told you, I was in the car listening to the basketball game.
that's true.
I saw him.
I was mad that he ditched me, so I went to drag his ass back inside.
but when I saw him shouting at the radio,
I decided I'll just wait and make his life miserable when we get home.
so unless there's a law agains choosing Lebron James over your wife,
I think we're done here.
all right.
so that's it?
y-you're just gonna let him go?
look, we don't have enough evidence to hold him, sir.
because his wife provided him an alibi?
come on, man.
you know me.
if Tom had done something like this, do you really think I would protect him?
fine.
you know, you didn't have to make up that story for me.
didn't i?
cause it kinda seemed like they had you against the ropes in there.
well, that would only be a problem if I were guilty, and clearly, I'm not, right?
God, you don't believe me, do you? - Sure, I do.
it must've been some other random maniac with a grudge against Rick who burned down his restaurant.
so you're calling me a liar?
that's what you're doing. You're saying I lied.
well, it wouldn't be the first time.
you lied about the brick, and you were pretty smooth, too.
hell, I bought it.
Yeah, just like I bought your story about never sleeping with Rick.
excuse me?
Oh, look at me, rick. You know me, Rick. - Okay.
God, I felt like telling you guys to get a room.
okay, you are angry, so I'm gonna let that one pass, and I'm gonna say this for every last time.
nothing happened between me and Rick.
okay.
I didn't set that fire.
you see? I can talk slow, too.
Carlos asked me to pick up some doggy treats for Roxy.
he called you?
why didn't he ask me?
Oh, I think you were busy at the time...kidnapping his guide dog.
classy, by the way.
don't judge me.
you don't know this hound from hell.
I raise my voice a teensy bit, and she barks, or I give Carlos a little smack, and she growls.
well, I have an idea.
why don't you not do those things?
thanks for the biscuits, Edie.
no, I'm serious.
there was always a certain...sick charm to the way you used to abuse Carlos.
but now that he's blind, it's just sick.
we're fine.
this is who we are.
this is our relationship.
well, your relationship has to change, Gaby, because he's changed.
not that much. Just his eyes.
mm, no.
I know Carlos. He's proud.
he's gonna pretend that he can still go toe-to-toe with you as if he was the same man that he always was.
but he's not, and he will never admit that.
are you done with your armchair analysis, 3-divorce Annie?
sure.
but if you're not gonna treat Carlos right, there are plenty of other womenout there who will.
I think I proved that.
why don't you come inside?
I can't come out my front door every day and see that man.
we have to move.
I know this is difficult, but before you start putting up "for sale" signs, let's just take a step back.
take a step back from what?
he tried to murder you.
I know what Orson did was horrible, but...
I've decided to forgive him.
how can you do that?
he put you in a coma.
I sat there day after day, wondering if you were gonna live.
as far as I'm concerned, Orson can go to hell.
well, I've talked to him.
trust me, he's already been there.
well, that's not enough.
he should pay for what he did.
he should go to prison.
and what, leave Bree without a husband and Benjamin without a dad?
you don't want that look...
I've done some pretty horrible things in my life, but you forgave me because you knew how much I regretted 'em.
I really believe he's sorry for what he did.
so now i have to forgive hi
I've just got to.
but...
I also understand if you can't.
Hey, you guys know you're not supposed to be out of bed.
how come daddy's sleeping on the couch again?
come here.
come on.
okay.
mommy and daddy are sort of...fighting, but we're working through it.
what are you fighting about?
Oh, something he did that made mommy really mad.
can we talk to you about something?
Yes, of course.
the other day at the pizza place...
we heard daddy say that man wanted to take you away from us.
Oh, sweetie, I am so sorry.
I bet that really scared you, didn't it?
Yeah.
so when you went to that party, we got on our bikes and de down to his restaurant.
you did what?
we just wanted him to go away.
that's why we set the fire.
so please don't be mad at daddy.
Oh, my god.
Mike says I need to forgive Orson...
Susan-- - and he's right.
I have to find a way to make peace with all of this.
but you need to understand, it's gonna be one of the hardest things I've ever done.
and like most things in my life, I probably won't do it with much elegance or grace.
so if I don't come over to your house for coffee...
if I don't smile when the two of you walk by, just please know that I still love you.
and for forgiving Orson...
just be patient.
I'll get there.
I think it's admirable that you wanna forgive Orson...
because I can't.
whatcha doin'?
working on the menu for the event that Bree and I are catering.
I have to stop now to...pick up the invitations at the printer's before they close.
I can do that for you.
it's okay, sweetie.
no, I want to.
maybe I could pick up some dinner for us on the way back.
you know, Mrs. Hoskins' daughter became nice like this once...
right before she brought home a boy named Slash.
I'm being nice because I've been a pain lately, and...
with Adam gone, we need to be a team.
it's just us now.
what?
it's just...
it's like you turned into this lovely young woman when I wasn't looking.
we have to stop at the printer on the way to dinner.
whatever you say, sweetheart.
the truth is, everyone breaks the rules now and then...
well, what you've you been doing?
never thinking for one second they might get caught.
some things disappear.
like, that happened to me like...
but if they do, they simply ask for forgiveness.
and most of the time, they receive it.
but some acts are so wicked, they demand only our condemnation.
how do people avoid such a fate?
well...the trick is knowing which rules are made to be broken...
and which rules...
are not.
Adam was finished with Katherine...
please get rid of that gum.
but Dylan's father came back.
Bye, sweetheart. - Bye, dad.
I tricked you into thinking Dylan was yours.
I finished that D.N.A. You wanted, and your suspect's not related to the victim at all.
Gaby and Carlos were forced to go to the police.
are you sure it was cocaine?
Carlos, I was a fashion model in the '90s.
I know cocaine.
just give me what I want...
and Lynette...
or you're not gonna like what happens.
was pushed to her breaking point.
coffee mugs to the contrary, Lynette Scavo knew that she was not the world's greatest mother.
in fact, when it came to parenting, Lynette had done many things she was not proud of...
like the time when she offered parker cash if he agreed to eat all of his spinach...
or when she told the twins there was treasure buried beneath the weeds...
or when she gave her kids a little extra cough syrup so she could finish her novel.
but despite these lapses...
Lynette didn't think of herself as the worst mother in the world either, until one horrible day.
since when do you make waffles?
well, Kayla loves waffles, and since she and I have been having some problems lately,
I wanted to do something nice for her.
Oh, you tell Kayla her breakfast is ready.
my name is Fern Parrish. This is my colleague, Irene Semanis. we're from C.P.S.
uh, one sec.
Preston, you might wanna stop dropping your waffle on the floor, 'cause I'm still gonna make you eat it.
so, uh, what's C.P.S?
children's protective services.
for what it's worth, I keep my floors incredibly clean.
Mrs. Scavo, we recently received a report of some abuse in your home.
abuse? That's ridiculous.
well, we got a call from a Dr. Joshua Dolan?
it seems he was contacted by your daughter Kayla.
who says you hit her... repeatedly.
okay...
first, I'm not that kind of mom.
and second, Kayla has a tendency to... exaggerate.
we also have a security tape from a clothing store.
it shows you slapping a young girl across the face.
we're assuming that's Kayla.
have a seat. I'll be with you in a second.
Yes, Lynette Scavo was not the world's greatest mother.
but in her heart, she knew she had done the best she could given what she had to work with.
"Lynette"-- it's how the French describe "a pretty one."
"Katherine"-- coined by the ancient Greeks, it denotes "purity."
"Gabrielle"-- a Hebrew word meaning "god is my strength."
"Bree"-- it's an irish name that means "power."
indeed...
every name has a single specific meaning...
which is why parents have trouble choosing one for someone who means everything to them.
what about "philip"? I like "philip."
Oh, I know you do.
I don't, and neither does the baby.
Philip? Oh, Phil? See? Nothing. Not even a burp.
here's a thought. How about "Nathaniel"?
all right, that's the fourth time you've tried to sneak "Nathaniel" past me.
I'm putting "Peyton" back on the table.
I am not naming my son after a quarterback.
all right, here's the rest of my list. Lucas.
it sounds like "mucus."
Mitchum. - Like the deodorant?
Unitas. - Oh, give me that.
well, we need new inspiration.
I like it. Who is he?
he's a guy who... "killed six, then self."
well, I give up.
he's not gonna get a name.
when we want him to come, we'll just whistle and say, "here, boy."
Dr. Conner. Paging Dr. Conner. Please call admitting.
Conner. - I love it.
me, too.
Oh, you finally have a name.
Dr. Conner Delfino.
I'm going out to the mall. You wanna come with?
Oh, no, thanks. I gotta make sure my handyman gets his wiring done.
he screwed it up the last time.
you realize we could've had a fire?
sorry, Mrs. Solis.
all right, then. See you later.
and... she's gone.
great. Let's break into her room.
as soon I finish this, I'll start placing bugs in the other rooms.
well, isn't her room enough?
she has a prepaid cell phone, so we can't tap it.
our only hope at nailing her supplier is to record every conversation she has in this house.
well, how long is that gonna take?
we got a tip that she's expecting a delivery this week.
so it won't be long before miss Leonard learns the joys of a little girl-on-girl action in a prison shower.
okay, first of all, you're a pig.
second of all, don't say things like that. Ellie's my friend.
Yeah, well, your friend is a drug dealer, I. E. Scum.
you don't even know her.
okay, yes, she's made some bad choices, but deep down, she's a good person.
Yeah, well, deep down, I hope she rots in jail.
okay, when this thing is over, let's not do the whole Christmas card thing.
is that your husband?
no, he's at braille school.
Oh, Ellie!
what the hell are you doing in my room?
we weren't expecting you back so soon.
I forgot my wallet.
again, what the hell are you doing in my room?
well, we needed some privacy.
see, Roy and I are lovers.
you're having an affair with your handyman?
I know, it's crazy.
you wouldn't believe the passion.
I mean, I was powerless to resist.
just-- just get out of my room.
okay, okay. We're going.
that's for using your tongue.
lots of people do missionary work, but few have the guts to smuggle bibles into North Korea.
it is my distinct pleasure to welcome back, after four long years
Reverend Michael Green.
thank you for that glorious introduction, Joe.
well, it's good to be back.
now if you'll all please stand and offer each other the lord's peace.
peace be with you, Bree.
I reject your peace, and I demand you stop stalking me.
I'm doing no such thing.
Really? So I just happen to run into you at the dry cleaner, the greengrocer, the post office?
we shared a life together.
it's only natural we'd frequent the same places.
Oh, please. I saw you at my nail salon.
there's nothing in the bible that says a man can't enjoy a nice pedicure.
Orson, hear me when I say this. It's over.
you have done unconscionable things for which I can never forgive you, and no amount of flitting about in my peripheral vision is going to change that.
but there must be something I can do.
you know I've repented. We--we can get past this.
I know no such thing. Now be quiet. I'm done talking to you.
Bree, so nice to see you again.
peace be with you.
and also with you.
do not give this man peace.
you shouldn't keep your doors unlocked, Kathy.
why do you think they call 'em "crimes of opportunity"?
what do you want?
Dylan used to have a big old scar right here, and now it's gone.
I'm just curious how you would explain that.
never too early to start drinking, is it?
she fell off her bike. 11 stitches. I remember.
I took her to a plastic surgeon in Chicago 'cause I didn't want her to feel self-conscious.
well, that's pretty convenient.
what are you suggesting, Wayne?
something's not right.
I felt it from the moment that I laid eyes on her.
I just don't see myself in her at all.
I told you. She's not yours.
Yeah, but I don't see you in her either.
so...
let's just settle this once and forll.
take a D.N.A. Test.
all I need is one strand of hair.
knock, knock. Is this a bad time?
no, not at all.
great, because we are here to throw ourselves on your mercy.
we are having a commitment ceremony in five days, and our caterer just canceled.
we know it's short notice.
totally understand if you say no.
nonsense. I'd love to do it.
why don't you have a seat, and we'll talk details?
I'm sorry if... you're busy, can come back later.
no, no. No, that's okay. You stay.
I'll come back later.
Lynette, I'm sorry.
when I'm told about a suspected case of child abuse, I am bound by law to report it.
okay, so what happens now?
I'm just trying to help C.P.S. finish their investigation.
they'll intervieyour kids, their teachers, possibly some of your neighbors.
my neighbors? God! I could strangle that girl.
honey, you might wanna stop saying things like that.
look, for the next few days, let Tom handle the kids.
any other problems between you and Kayla could jeopardize custody of all your children.
wait. They could take my children?
no one's taking anyone.
you have got to be kidding me!
this is all a big misunderstanding.
I'm sure that we can work this out.
so what do I need to do to keep my kids?
well, there are a lot of things you can do.
first, no physical discipline...
Bob liked the idea of the onion and white asparagus tart.
wonderful! With a little goat cheese.
Oh, and Lee asked for stuffed mushrooms.
those with roasted green beans as our side dishes.
nice tight grouping.
you are not rusty at all.
thank you. Felt good.
although I always, uh, like a trip to the range, is there any particular reason we came here for party planning?
well, with Adam gone, I've just been feeling a little...
uneasy lately.
it's funny how having a man in the house can make you feel safer, no matter how retiring or easily spooked he might be.
that's true.
I just need to feel that if an intruder broke in, I could take care of it effectively.
you really want to be effective?
try hollow points.
these rounds you've got punch straight though, but a hollow point blooms on impact, cuts the body to shreds from the inside.
sounds exactly like what I need.
now... let's talk desserts.
I just got a call from my mom. My grandpa died.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I know how much you loved him.
well, actually, I've been thinking about it.
I know we settled on "Conner," but I'd, uh, I'd like to name our son after my grandfather.
well, yeah, um, I mean, "Conner" is just a name we picked out of thin air.
this would mean something.
so you're okay with this?
think it's a beautiful way to honor your grandfather.
I mean, "James" wouldn't be my first choice, but it's a good, solid name.
no, grandpa James is my dad's dad. This is my mom's--Maynard.
Oh, right. Maynard.
Oh, that's awful... that he died.
why didn't we think of this before?
it's such a beautiful southern name.
Oh, and rare, really rare.
and you're right. It's a great way to honor my grandfather.
Yeah. I said that, didn't I?
Oh, shoot. We can't do it.
isn't your grandpa James significantly older than grandpa Maynard?
shouldn't we honor him first?
but grandpa James isn't dead.
you sure? It's worth a phone call.
actually, I've got a cousin who's named after him already, so we're covered.
thank you, Susan. This really means a lot.
I'm gonna go call my mom.
forgive me.
don't look at me like that. His grandfather just died.
lunch is almost ready.
I'm making your favorite.
I take it you're still mad at me.
well, yeah. I just don't get why you broke into my room.
well, I couldn't risk doing it in my room.
ever since Carlos went blind, he's developed a strong sense of smell.
I don't know if you happened to catch a whiff of Roy, but that is one telltale odor.
well, that's another thing, you know?
what do you see in that guy?
uh, you know, he's a handyman.
he knows how to... get in there...
and make stuff work.
but he's a zero, and Carlos is so fantastic.
don't you love him?
of course I do.
Carlos Solis is the love of my life.
but, you know, sometimes you get bored, and a big, greasy, disgusting handyman really hits the spot.
Adam, what the-- you scared me half to death.
sorry. I let myself in.
Why?
Dylan told me Wayne's back.
why didn't you call me? - Because I'm handling it.
Yeah, she told me about the shooting range, too.
you sure that's the best way to handle it?
Adam, you made it very clear that you were done with me.
but I'm not done with Dylan, and if Wayne's back, then I'm gonna protect her.
so maybe I should pay him a little visit, scare him off.
if you'd ever met Wayne, you'd know better.
well, then let's get Dylan out of town.
I tried. She said she's not leaving.
well, I...
I promised her a trip for graduation, just the three of us, anywhere she wanted to go.
okay. But what happens when the trip's over?
won't we just be at square one again?
not if we don't come back.
Oh, Susan. He's adorable.
he's so precious.
so it's been two days now.
did you and Mike finally land on a name?
interesting. - It has a very distinct ring.
okay, drop the act, ladies. I hate it, too.
Mike insisted that we name him after his dead grandfather.
how did he die? Was he beaten to death 'cause his name was Maynard?
I know. It's terrible, but I can't change it now.
Mike was so emotional about it.
well, then appeal to his sense of reason, because the name "Maynard" doesn't go with the name of "Delfino."
one is German and the other is Italian, and we all know what happens when those folks get together.
well, I'm not sure that the world war Ⅱ argument is gonna fly.
come on. You have to do something.
I mean, that name is practically abusive.
Yeah, think about your son.
people live up to the names they're given.
if my parents hadn't named me "Gabrielle," who knows if I'd be this pretty?
I guess that's why they didn't name you "Einstein."
so sarcastic, but what would you expect from a "Lynette"?
what? If your name was "Francesca," you wouldn't have time for sarcasm.
you'd be too busy having sex on a vespa.
you're right. My son's future is at stake. I have to do something.
maybe not. We call Gabrielle "Gaby."
I mean, perhaps there's a shortened version of "Maynard" you could live with.
Yeah. Which says "kick my ass" less-- "may" or "nerd"?
what's going on?
Lynette Scavo, I'm placing you under arrest.
what? Why? Wh--for what?
Kayla showed us the burn mark on her arm.
burn mark? What burn mark?
you see? She doesn'tnow anything about this. - Okay, sir.
now please, if we could just go back and talk about this... - That's enough. sir, enough!
ma'am, you're gonna have to come with us.
Tom. - Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go call the attorney.
I--okay. Look, look, I-I will come with you.
please, just don't handcuff me in front of my children.
well, you should have thought of that before you hurt one of them.
Lynette Scavo, you have the right to remain silent.
if you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to have an attorney present during questioning.
if you do not have one, we will appoint one for you.
well, I'd--I'd be delighted to speak to them, Bree.
perhaps I can tell 'em the story about the time I evaded the North Korean border patrol by hiding in a pile of oxen dung.
they'll love that.
this is gonna be the best seniors' brunch ever.
I'm so glad you're back.
between you and me, Reverend Sykes tended to pander to the congregation's progressive element.
I prefer your more muscular brand of christianity.
well, thank you, Bree.
I thought of you also.
I'm so sorry to hear about rex's passing, but I understand that you remarried.
I did, but, um, I'm afraid it hasn't worked out.
it's been rough.
for what it's worth, I know how you feel.
when Carolyn left me, the loneliness was crippling.
I didn't know she left you.
Yes, for our Korean grocer.
I'll tell you, sometimes this merciful god of ours has one sick sense of humor.
Hartman, table for 4, 7: 30. See you then.
table for one? - Yes.
Scavo's.
is everything all right?
Oh, this is a bit awkward, but my soon-to-be ex just walked in.
he's been following me everywhere.
for ace, 8: 30 P. M. All right.
would you mind terribly if I took your hand?
maybe that way, he'll finally get the idea that I've moved on.
my hand is at your service.
right this way, sir.
will you be needing a wine list?
actually, I...
think I'll be needing a new restaurant.
Ah, it worked. Thank you for that.
it was my pleasure.
the bail bondsman said he has to run a credit check, then he'll wire the money.
so after you've been processed, you can leave.
and go where?
I can't get within 500 feet of my children.
are you not up to speed on the people vs. Lynette Scavo?
we'll figure something out.
Mrs. Scavo, it's time to go.
no, you'll figure something out. I have to go bk to my cell.
honey, I am so sorry about this. Look it, just hang in there.
it's only gonna be a couple more hours at the most.
how can you talk like that?
what else has to happen for you to get what's going on here?
I do get it.
but Kayla's my daughter, so I'm trying to deal with this in a way that protects our family.
no, you are trying to stay on the fence while I fight to stop Kayla from destroying us.
but look around you, Tom. Look where I am!
you have got to do something now.
fix this.
well, thank you for a lovely evening, bree.
you know, it's funny.
I don't think I'll be able to look at you as just another parishioner anymore.
now, now. We mustn't play favorites, although I will take that as a compliment.
well, take this as a compliment as well.
your eyes glimmer like the yalu river on a moonlit night.
how, um, colorfully put.
what does that mean?
I want you.
Reverend Green!
when you took my hand in that restaurant, I could feel the electricity, and I know you felt it, too.
no, I told you. I was only trying to send a message to my ex.
Oh, please. There's always been sexual tension between us, ever since palm sunday 1996, when we both reached for the same frond.
No!
Bree, if I took no for an answer, Kangwon Province would still have 242 unsaved souls.
well, now you're sending out mixed signals.
then let me send you a clear one.
I am not attracted to you.
Oh, nice.
first, you use me, then you reject me, and now you're insulting me?
maybe you should go now, Mrs. Hodge.
Oh, Reverend Green, please don't be upset.
shoot!
Ellie, can you help me for a sec?
sure. What's...
I spilled my milk again.
don't worry. I'll clean it up.
God, I'm so sick of knocking crap over.
I don't know how Gaby puts up with me. She's a saint.
Yeah, well...
well," what?
Hey, sweetie. - Hey, whore!
excuse me?
I know all about your affair with the handyman.
Ellie told me everything.
that little snitch.
I can't believe she did that!
well, thanks for letting me know.
uh, hello?
are we even gonna talk about this?
Yeah, the second that bitch gets home, I'm gonna let her have it.
boy, you trust someone, and they just betray you.
it sucks, you know?
Yeah, I know!
Gaby, you cheated and you got caught.
now will you please hand me a plate so I can smash it against the wall?
Oh, you moron! There was no affair! That was the cop.
Ellie caught us putting the bug in her room.
that was just an excuse we used as a cover.
and you expect me to believe that?
I got news for you, Carlos. You're blind.
you don't have a choice anymore.
you have to believe what I tell you.
just like when I hand you the deodorant, you have to believe it's not oven cleaner.
I know it's not fair.
I know it gives me absolute power, but tough.
you're screwed. Deal with it!
are we good?
okay. - Thank you.
now please, I just lost a friend.
stop being so insensitive.
pastor Joe. I noticed that there are no programs.
Oh, yes. Reverend Green decided to change today's scripture reading.
it's going to be colossians 3: 5.
Oh, he wants to talk about sexual promiscuity?
well, it was a last minute thing.
he came in this morning muttering about some "redheaded harlot" in our midst who needs to be unmasked.
I don't know. I was just so relieved he was off the Koreans, I didn't ask questions.
excuse me a minute.
hello.
sorry. I know this is a bad time.
aren't you Bree Hodge's ex-husband?
no, I'm her current husband, and I need to speak to you about today's sermon.
they're a little late getting started.
I know, and Reverend Green is usually such a stickler for punctuality.
well, I don't mean to be rude, but I don't think my sermon is any of your business.
let me put it this way.
if you say anything about Bree, you and I are gonna have a problem.
well, I'm sorry you feel that way, but I think it's my duty as pastor to warn my flock when a temptress sits among us.
now if you'll excuse me.
what the hell's the matter with you?
I'm not going to let you go out there and trash that good woman's name.
"good woman"? She led me on.
who are they talking about?
she's a flame-haired jezebel!
you're insane!
she is the most moral person I know! - I have no idea.
now if you'll please excuse me. - Would a moral person lead a man on and then humiliate him?
I don't care what she did to you.
I am not going to let you publicly declare that Bree Hodge is a slut!
Oh, dear lord.
then again, I suppose I could preach about tolerance today.
Hello, Maynard.
I love you, Maynard.
my sweet little... may may.
hello.
I need to change the name on my baby's birth certificate.
okay, last name? - Delfino, Maynard.
Where's the father? You both need to sign this.
working. Busy, busy, busy.
uh, but he told me to tell you that he's totally cool with it.
well, I'm busy, busy, busy, too.
so when he's available, you can come on back, and we'll make the change.
okay.
I'm just gonna level with you.
my husband picked the name, and I think it's horrible, and I know over time, he's gonna agree.
I don't care. Rules are rules.
you gotta help me out here.
I'm just trying to protect my child.
I don't want him to go through life saddled with the name "Maynard."
I don't see what the big deal is.
well, of course, you don't. You're Vanessa.
you went through life with a beautiful name.
that's why you have such a crackerjack personality.
I think we're done here.
I have a couple errands to run. Will you cover for me?
no problem. - Thanks, Griselda.
that must have been a tough name to take out on the playground.
Yeah. Actually, it was.
we should talk.
I'm, uh, here to check on Orson Hodge.
an ambulance brought him in less than an hour ago.
are you family?
I'm his wife.
well, he's going to be fine.
the's no concussion, but the doctors do wanna keep him here for a couple of hours.
should I tell him that you're here?
no, that's all right. Let him rest.
but please take excellent care of him.
he's a good man.
Gaby, can I talk to you?
about how you snitched on me to Carlos?
no, thanks. I'm all caught up on that.
I'm sorry, but I know from experience what cheating can do to people.
let me guess.
this story ends with you throwing your boyfriend's varsity jacket in the lake?
when I was 13, my dad caught my mom having an affair, and he walked out on us.
we had nothing, okay?
my mom went crazy, and I ended up on the street.
to survive, I...
I had to do a bunch of stuff that I'm not proud of.
Oh, ellie, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.
what have we got here?
that's our guy.
the point is, the one bad decision can me up a lot of lives, and I just don't want that to happen to you and Carlos 'cause I love you guys.
yes?
supplier's coming your way.
we're gonna arrest them both, so get out of there now.
okay. Bye.
anyway, I didn't mean to get into a whole thing.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
the cops are coming. Go.
what?
police! Drop the bag! Drop the bag! Hands behind your head.
it's a sting. Go out the back now.
mom said you were coming tonight.
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world...
so you better be on your "a" game. - Okay.
and we're all going out to dinner afterward.
Adam wants to tell you about your graduation present.
what? What is it?
no, no, no. You gotta wait, but I'll give you a clue.
I hope your passport's up-to-date.
Yeah, no. It's--it's okay, Andrew.
you can, uh, you can just-- you can finish it in the morning.
great. See ya. Bye.
need some help with that?
I didn't think you liked puzzles.
I can give it a shot.
I need to talk to you...
about Lynette.
I'm sorry I had to call Dr. Dolan, daddy, but she scares me.
Yeah. You said that before, but here's the thing.
they're gonna let Lynette go soon, and when they do, you guys aren't gonna be able to live in the same house anymore.
you--you know that, right?
so where is she gonna live?
like, in a hotel or something?
she lives here, Kayla, with me and the boys and Penny.
this is her home. - But
but don't worry. We're gonna find you a nice place to live.
daddy, I don't wanna go anywhere.
I wanna stay here with you.
I don't have a choice, Kayla.
I need to keep you safe.
but I made it all up.
I lied about everything.
I burned myself.
and why would you do that, Kayla?
I hate her.
and it's so much better when it's just us.
I see.
and you'll explain all this to the police and Dr. Dolan and everybody, right?
Yes, promise.
and then I can stay, right?
no, sweetie. No.
what you did was horrible, and I can't trust you anymore.
then I'm gonna keep lying to everybody.
you don't want that, do you?
did you get all that, Dr. Dolan?
I'm gonna go stretch my legs and check my service real quick.
okay, but intermission's only ten minutes. - Yeah.
excuse me.
could you give me a hand?
what's up? - Nail in my tire.
I gotta change it now 'cause I need to leave after my daughter's solo.
I'm--I'm catching a red-eye.
Yeah, sure. I can help.
Oh, thanks. I'm right over here.
this thing's really flat.
usually with a nail, you get a slow leak.
Yeah. I'm lucky I even made it here.
well, I got this. You grab the spare.
my daughter's the one that plays the cello. Which one is your daughter?
that the other thing I need your help with.
Oh, honey, can you get all my toiletries out of the bathroom?
what are those?
well, it's cute, aren't they?
it's a hospital tradition.
get them out of here now.
Why?
because my husband is terrified of balloons.
he was once molested by a clown.
Oh, my gosh. - oh, I got it.
what's going on?
I'm sorry, sir. We didn't know about the clown.
why does that say "Conner"?
is that what it said?
we had "Maynard" ones printed up, but Drs. Delfino... Went to the records office...
Susan... what's going on?
well... I hate the name "Maynard."
Really? I like it- - get out.
I'm sorry. I...
I just want our d to have a great name.
I don't think "Maynard" is great.
you wanna know what is great?
my grandfather...
started the first integrated elementary school in Tennessee.
and you know what else is great?
when my dad went to prison, the state wanted to put me in the system.
my grandfather wouldn't let 'em.
he took in my mom and me and sacrificed everything just to make sure we had a great life.
I didn't know about that.
Susan, I don't want to just give our son a name.
I want to give him someone to live up to.
let's hope he's worthy.
well, that part's up to us.
well, that's all of her things.
well, we should probably get going, hmm?
we found a hotel with a pool for tonight.
maybe you and grandpa can go swimming.
Sheila, can I talk to her for a sec?
honey, I know this is hard on you.
but I'm gonna come visit you at grandpa and grandma's all the time.
so it's not like it's good-bye forever.
I'm sorry how everything turned out.
no, you're not.
okay, then.
I love you, baby.
have a safe trip.
daddy! I'm sorry!
daddy, I'm sorry! Please!
daddy! Please!
what's in a name?
do the labels we attach to people tell us everything we need to know?
if we say she's just a child, does this mean she's truly innocent?
does calling her a drug dealer prove she's purely evil?
will a man known as "preacher" always practice what he preaches?
can a man branded a villain possess the qualities of a hero?
the truth is, a name can never really tell you who someone is...
who are you?
any more than it can tell you what they're capable of.
I'm Wayne Davis...
and we're about to have some fun.
that maniac was serving a life sentence.
Hello, ladies.
paul Young came back.
Doug is leaving me. - Lynette's friend had nowhere to go.
I've spent eight years loving someone else's daughter.
a baby was switched long ago, and Carlos made a decision.
we're not telling Gaby. - Susan got a job offer.
women doing housework in lingerie.
while Bree's contractor...
with your red hair, you will look so hot in this room.
brought possibilities to light.
all set.
now that you're a biker chick, there's one other thing you gotta know how to do.
Thanks, Mister.
it had been a long time since Bree Van De Kamp was a little girl, but she could still remember everything she'd ever been told about sex.
her grandmother informed her it was a woman's burden.
her minister warned her it was a sin.
her teacher taught her it was unhealthy.
Yes, everyone had told Bree her sexual urges were dangerous.
but no one had ever told her...
how to get rid of them.
Hey. There you are.
I'm off to the bank.
before you go, I wanna show you something. come here.
whole new idea.
I wanna panel the study in this.
Oh. Well, that's, uh, unusual.
historical birch from a Wyoming snow fence. Over 200 years old. Feel it.
no. Really. Feel it.
you know what they call this?
witness wood, 'cause it's seen so much history, unlike me, who slept through history and had to go to summer school.
I have to go. It's late.
Yes, when Bree was a little girl, she'd been taught her sexual urges were dangerous.
unfortunately, she was about to learn...
those urges were dangerous... For everyone.
the doctors and nurses at Fairview Hospital are experts at healing.
they can set bones...
bandage wounds...
and treat diseases.
sadly, one thing they don't know how to heal is a guilty conscience.
I don't know what happened. She just came out of nowhere.
Oh, honey, this could've been any of us.
kids on that street always playing where they shouldn't be.
still, I would just feel better if they would come out - and tell us something. - Juanita was talking when they put her in the ambulance, so I'm sure everything's gonna be fine.
and I just spoke to one of the nurses.
she seemed pretty positive. - Well, that's a relief.
Paul?
W... what are you doing here?
I heard about the accident, so I... I rushed right over.
that's what neighbors do, right?
well, that's very thoughtful.
we'll tell Gaby you stopped by.
Yeah, don't feel like you have to hang around. There's nothing we can do.
we can pray.
dear lord, we ask that you be with this young child and with the doctors caring for her...
and that she may be returned in full health to loving family. Amen.
Amen.
well, I have to get home. I'm expecting someone.
please extend my good wishes to Baby.
dear lord, please don't let that creep ever touch me again.
Amen.
Oh, Gaby, thank god.
how is Juanita?
she's gonna be fine.
they're keeping her a couple days for observation. - Oh.
so I told Carlos he doesn't even have to fly back from his business trip.
that's great news.
Yeah, it is.
uh, Bree, Andrew, can I talk to you for a second?
thanks for coming.
I feel so blessed to have such wonderful...
what the hell is wrong with you people?!
first you take out my mother-in-law, then you go after my daughter.
are you trying to kill off every Juanita Solis on the planet?!
I admit it was a terrible coincidence.
you're gettin' sloppy, you know. This one was in broad daylight.
I'm sorry. She just came out of nowhere.
have you seen my daughter? She never comes out of nowhere.
uh, on a related note, I just wanna say how much I appreciate you not telling Carlos about me running over his mom.
I'm gonna give you that one 'cause I wasn't fond of her.
but as for the rest of my family, learn to swerve!
why does this keep happening?
I don't know. I mean, maybe god's punishing us.
or god is punishing the Solises, and we're just doing god's work.
I feel awful.
I should never have been fiddling with that radio.
radio? Mom, I saw you from across the street.
you were checking out Keith's ass.
that's preposterous.
you were looking at that contractor's but like you were waiting for a side of steak sauce.
watch your mouth. This isn't one of your homosexual dance clubs.
I'm telling you, it was the radio.
okay. Fine. But while we're talking about the radio, uh, you do know that that particular model is, like, 15 years too young for you, right?
who is it?
Maxine. - oh!
Oh, uh, hang on a second.
Ah, I was just wrapping up my first session.
I know. I was watching.
And? What'd you think?
it was like watching a dream.
and you know why? 'Cause I was asleep.
sit down, honey.
it's time I gave you a few pointers.
now... you see what I'm doing here?
Ohh.
and let's not forget the duster.
okay. Okay, I... I get it.
and what have we here? Smudges.
uh, we eat off that table.
am I making my point?
we are selling a fantasy here.
you gotta, you know, loosen up.
I want to. I just...
I can't stop thinking about all those men out there watching me.
Yes, they're watching you.
they are spending their hard-earned dollars to see the perfect woman.
you, my darling, have all the power here.
now...
is that a crumb I see on that rug?
Mm. Oh.
Oh.
that's it. - Ah!
that's my girl. - Ooh!
Doug, if your lawyers don't sweeten the settlement offer,
I will sue you for half of everything, and that includes your girlfriend's new implants.
you paid for 'em out of our joint account, so technically, one of those puppies is mine.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe throw it in the pool and use it as a floatie.
uh, Renee.
Oh, she's gonna be dating soon enough.
it's time she learned what men are all about.
now, sweetie, what did Auntie Renee teach you about marriage?
never sign a prenup.
Oh! Jeez!
Hey!
what are you doing home from work? - I'm not feeling well.
again?
that's the third time this week. You need to go to the doctor.
no, I'm fine. I'm just gonna lie on the couch and watch some TV.
okay.
Oh!
before you fire up the golf channel, you think maybe you could make a quick run - to the grocery store? - I'm tired. Can't you do it?
I'm a little busy right now.
I've got five kids and a useless houseguest.
hi there.
I need you functional.
either go to the doctor and get some help or quit complaining and give me some help.
fine. I'll go tomorrow.
man, the sympathy in here is just overwhelming.
what?
nothing. It's none of my business.
but...
you may wanna be careful.
you two are starting to sound a lot like me and Doug.
I appreciate the concern, but Tom and I always do that.
Doug and I always did that, too.
look at us now.
I'm telling you, we're fine.
if you say so.
good.
the doctors say she's gonna be fine.
they're only keeping her in the hospital as a precaution.
she'll be home in a few days. - Oh, thank god.
well, look who's here, can we please not have another ugly scene?
I only came to check on Juanita. - She's fine.
fantastic.
so I see you let our tomato plants wither...
just like you did our relationship.
well, that's what happens when you grow needy, whiny tomatoes.
boys, boys, it's been a month.
can't you just kiss each other's bottoms and make up?
isn't that what they do?
who is that?
she looks lost.
should we help her?
Aah! Son of a bitch!
we should help her. - Son of a...
Oh! Oh!
miss, is everything okay?
no.
I am so lost.
I gave the cab driver the address, but I only had a $20, and it turns out that only gets you as far as Hibiscus Circle, so he dumped me, and I had to walk in these shoes, which broke, and that is the last time I am buying footwear over the internet.
uh, were you looking for Wisteria Lane?
Yeah, that sounds right.
is my fish moving?
if he goes belly-up, this is going to be the worst day ever.
who is it you're here to see?
uh, Paul Young.
Really? Are you a friend of his?
well... - Beth!
Oh! I thought you were gonna be here hours ago.
well... I see you've all met my wife.
sorry, it got... really hot in here, and I thought you'd be gone for a while.
so how is Juanita? Is she okay?
um, she's doing much better.
thank you for asking.
thank god. How are you doing?
um, me? I'm okay.
how's the work coming?
pretty good.
just getting ready to put, uh...
shoot. It's on backwards.
Bree?
you sure you're okay?
I'm fine. Fine.
it's just been a very... stressful day.
I think I know what you need.
it's okay.
hitting that little girl was an accident.
it could've happened to anyone.
I have to let you go!
huh?
after you let me go. Everyone should just let go!
are you firing me? Why?
you're too messy.
your tools... they're scattered everywhere.
well, this is a construction site. - And you're getting paint all over the place.
and that cologne of yours... it's overpowering.
I don't wear cologne.
that's just you?
Oh, dear.
anyway, obviously...
I will pay you for the time you've put in, - but I think you should go. - You can... send me a check.
Bye, guys. Have a great day.
Hey, aren't you going to work?
Oh, my first class isn't till 11: 00.
I thought I'd spend the morning making more jewelry.
wow, you really are determined to bring in some extra money.
you have no idea.
and you don't let me put my feet on that table.
Mike! Uh, what are you... what are you doing home so quick?
I forgot my thermos. What are you wearing?
uh...
uh, I was, uh, just... just doing housework...
o... obviously, and, uh, the air conditioning isn't working, so it got really hot in here.
I'll say...
mind if I join you?
No! No! Uh...
Oh!
uh... you know what?
why don't we take this in the bedroom?
what's wrong with right here?
I am one lucky guy...
to come home to a hot fantasy like this.
Yep. And I am one lucky girl to have a... have a husband like...
you. Ohh.
any luck finding an apartment?
not with my settlement. With New York prices,
I'll be forced to live in a place smaller than this.
Oh, my god. How will you keep from bumping into yourself?
you know what I was thinking?
why don't I just find a place here in Fairview?
Fairview?
uh... No.
no, no!
you're a New Yorker. You love the theater, museums.
you said yourself, you can't even get a decent cup of coffee around here.
uh, no, I meant here, Lynette.
really, how hard is it to clean the pot?
Hey! How'd it go with the doctor?
Yeah, can, uh, we, um...
talk about that?
so what did the doctor say?
you're gonna wanna sit down.
Tom, you are scaring me. What is it?
I have postpartum depression.
come again?
I know it sounds weird, b... but it's... it's...
it's a recognized problem for fathers my age.
I've got all the classic symptoms...
headaches, mood swings, fatigue.
Wow.
tell me, did he check you for a yeast infection while he was down there, too?
why don't you learn the facts before you make fun of it?
men and Postpartum:
the Bitter Seed.
Yeah, I'm... not buying it.
show me one stretch mark, one chapped nipple, and we'll talk about your postpartum.
it's a legitimate medical condition.
and you're the one who told me to go to the doctor.
so you could be of some use around here,
not so you could, uh...
Oh, "take long baths or get in some extra naps"?
do me a favor. Read the whole pamphlet.
gosh, I wish I could, Tom.
unfortunately, I have to go take care of my other baby.
I love the house.
Oh. Well, I did the best I could.
I think it needs a woman's touch.
Oh.
I... I don't have much experience with decorating.
if I so much as moved a chair, mama would throw a fit.
mm, then you must be happy to finally have your own home.
I guess.
look at this...
no plexiglas.
I never dreamed the day would come when I could reach out and touch you.
I didn't either.
there is one thing I'll miss about prison...
your letters.
some days, they were the only things keeping me going.
I'm glad you liked them.
uh, thank you again for going to so much trouble.
dinner is wonderful.
I wanted tonight to be special.
since the prison didn't allow conjugal visits, this is... kind of our wedding night.
about that.
I can't wait to start cooking for you and making things nice around here, but there are certain other...
wifely duties that I don't want to rush into.
Oh?
we're still getting to know each other.
mama said you'd understand.
Oh, I suppose I do.
you're not upset?
of course not.
there's more to marriage than sex.
Oh, Mrs. Solis, can I talk to you?
if this is about Juanita and the dessert cart,
I told you not to leave it unattended.
no, I was reviewing her chart, and I realized we still had a couple of questions.
is she allergic to any medications? - Uh, not that I'm aware of.
okay. All her vaccinations up-to-date? - Yes.
and how old was she when you adopted her?
I know it's hard to believe that the little acorn gave birth to the mighty oak, but believe me, I did.
okay.
maybe I'm confused, but the other day when we talked about possible blood transfusions, you told me you and your husband were type-O.
Yeah, we are. So?
W... well, your daughter is type-A. Two O's can't have an "A."
Oh.
never mind.
OA, whoa, whoa. What... what was that?
what was that "Oh. Never mind"?
it's none of my business.
no, no, tell me. What are you implying?
nothing.
I'm simply stating that the odds of Mr. Solis being the biological father of a type-A baby are roughly... nil.
are you suggesting I cheated on him?
I'm simply stating that the odds of Mr. Solis being - the biological father are... - Listen, nursie.
I know you spend your days emptying bedpans and shaving the groins of senior citizens, but there's no drama here.
I've been faithful to my husband.
I have nothing to hide.
give me that.
Ah. Good morning.
good morning.
did you have trouble sleeping?
Ah, I was up kinda late.
boy, that Tom sure can talk.
you were up with Tom?
huh? Oh. Yeah. I guess he had a lot on his mind.
no surprise after the way things went between you two yesterday.
he was complaining about that?
Oh, I don't want to get in the middle.
honey, you had a pajama party with my husband at 3: 00 in the morning.
you're in the middle.
well...
Tom feels that you don't listen to him.
Oy.
G... sure I do.
I heard that whole spiel about male postpartum, otherwise known by its initials... B. S.
see, that's just the thing.
he thinks you hear, but you don't listen.
okay.
okay, you stop.
I don't need you troubleshooting my marriage.
and I don't want you having any more of these little conversations with my husband.
okay. Fine.
and I mean it.
there you are! I called you an hour ago!
I was at school.
Hi, sweetie! The kids in your class made you a poster.
look what Brittany said. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. She loves it. Come on!
come on!
Oh! What is going on?!
okay. Do you remember eight years ago when we went on that ski weekend?
uh... Vaguely.
no, no, no, no, no! It can't be "vaguely."
I need you to focus. - Oh! Oh! Okay.
okay.
remember how you and I had dinner with that French guy?
the one you referred to as large package? - Exactly.
okay. Tell me everything you remember.
Ooh! I remember I had the fondue and I lost my strawberry, and the waiter almost caught me when I put my...
I'm talking about me and the package!
why are you yelling at me? - 'Cause I'm mad! You went off to bed and left me and Frenchie drinking at the hotel bar, and friends don't let friends flirt drunk!
now for the love of god, do you at least remember when I came back to the room?
I remember the sun was coming up.
Oh, god.
Gaby, you're not saying...
Yeah.
I think Juanita might be French.
when Carlos returned from his business trip.
he stopped at the hospital to visit his daughter, who had been sleeping peacefully.
then he came home to see his wife, who had been plotting frantically.
Oh, you're awake.
Mmm. You're really awake.
what...
Carlos, what are you doing?!
me? I just got into bed! You climbed on top of me.
I did? - Yeah.
you were kinda making out with me. Not that I'm complaining.
Oh, no. It's happening again!
what are you talking about?
my sexsomnia.
your what?
Yeah, it's like sleepwalking, except...
instead of using your legs, you use your... You know.
sexsomnia.
it's real. Look it up.
since when have you had that?
well, definitely before the girls were born.
I've never seen you do it before.
well, it mostly only happens when I'm really tired, like when I work out too much or go skiing.
well, then first thing tomorrow,
I'm checking out airfare to Aspen.
No! No, no, no. It's not a joke. It's dangerous.
it doesn't matter who I'm next to.
I could have sex and not even know it.
Wow.
well, since you're up...
no, I'm too tired...
and ashamed. Good night.
Hey, I thought I'd return this.
I borrowed it from Orson a while back. - Oh. Thank you.
so where's that Chippendale Dancer you hired to fix your house?
if you mean my contractor, his name is Keith, and I had to let him go.
Why? You catch him, uh, grating cheese on his abs?
it just wasn't working out.
must've been pretty bad for you to kick that shirtless wonder out of your front yard.
I was finally reaching my target heart rate on my walk.
you mean at your age, you still have urges to...
I'm not dead, Bree.
I may like my bed and my food soft, - but I like my men... - Okay. Okay. Just curious.
I guess I was hoping...
hoping what?
that one day I might outgrow all this.
Ah, that's why you fired Keith.
I just can't have him around. He's too distracting.
and I refuse to make a fool of myself.
and how would that happen?
well, let me run the numbers for you.
my marriage ended six days ago,
Keith is 15 years too young for me,
and my track record with lovers...
two dead, one in a wheelchair.
Bree, I can't tell you how to live your life.
all I know is that not living your life isn't the answer.
I've just... Never been very good at taking risks.
well, then get good, because take my word for it,
once they turn into regrets, it's too late.
okay.
Hi.
don't feel like you have to help or anything.
cool.
Oh.
Where's your dad? His car's gone.
uh, he and Renee went out to dinner.
he and renee?
Yeah. They went to that French restaurant dad likes.
they said you could join them if you want.
Oh, I want.
okay, you unload these groceries and look after your sister.
Nah, I've got plans tonight.
I don't want to get stuck babysitting.
cool.
Hey.
Hey. Good, you got the message.
loud and clear. So you guys sure look like you're discussing something heavy.
Ahem. What's up?
to be honest, I was talking about you...
and your tendency to be critical, and how frustrating it is to have my feelings invalidated whenever I bring up something you don't like.
Uh-huh.
Renee, sidebar.
did I or did I not tell you to butt the hell out of my marriage?
what did I do?
I was just finishing my dessert and listening to the guy talk.
how frustrating it is to have my feelings invalidated?
that's got your $500-an-hour shrink written all over it.
I was just trying to help. - That's a load of crap.
you need a project, and since you're currently without a house to remodel, you've decided to put the wrecking ball to my marriage.
Oh, please. - This is what you do.
you take other people's lives apart for your own amusement,
and then you get the fun of putting them back together.
well, I'm not letting you do it this time.
my marriage is not some guest bathroom in your summer house.
fine. Let's just say that you're right, and I'm a terrible person.
but there's still a man in there who is in pain, and his wife won't listen to him. That's not my doing.
I think this sidebar is over.
Hey, Susan?
Hey.
Oh, those are beautiful. What's the occasion?
I called the bank to see if they would give us an extension on our car payment, and the guy told me you already paid it.
had a good week with my jewelry.
you're amazing.
you teach, you bust your ass with this jewelry business, and I come home yesterday, and here you are, as happy as can be, working to make this place a home.
I'm so lucky to have a wife like you.
Wow.
there ya go.
that's quite a haul.
you know, you're gettin' good as this.
I didn't think that was gonna happen.
I'm also getting good at lying to my husband.
I didn't think that was gonna happen either.
Hello, Keith.
how'd you find me?
you follow the scent of my nonexistent cologne?
no. Your answering service said I might find you here.
I was a little out of sorts the other day, and. Uh, well, long story short,
I was hoping you'd consider coming back.
I've got a buddy, loves sports cars.
I told him to buy an old pontiac G. T.O.
they run great, they're easy to work on.
but he bought a Maserati.
the thing is always in the shop, very temperamental, real pain in the ass.
you seem like kind of a Maserati to me.
I'm no Maserati, Keith.
I'm a family sedan with a beige interior who's going through a divorce.
well, I'm sorry about that, but I'm still gonna pass.
I... I need you.
you've seen my house. It's kind of a mess.
and the truth is, my life's kind of a mess, too.
and when you came in with all your energy and your wonderful ideas,
I started feeling like maybe you were gonna help me put it all back together...
my house, not my life.
I just want you to work on the house.
Wow.
I really do sound like a Maserati.
um...
thanks for listening.
Hey!
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god! Are you all right?
I didn't see you there. - You've got great legs.
you ever consider just jogging from place to place?
what were you doing behind my car?
I thought about what you said.
it'd be a shame if we didn't finish what we started.
