well, we're all here. We might as well celebrate.
I, uh, I ordered champagne for everybody.
which one's the ginger ale?
So...To Charlotte and Cooper.
to Charlotte and Cooper.
the smartest two people - I know, right?
you okay? - Yeah.
um... That's not ginger ale.
it's no biggie.
I mean, I am, you know, a woman in my 40s.
I have had my share of sex. I've had some...
pretty spectacular...
you know. I've had sex, okay?
but sam is this, like...
I don't know. Maybe it's because... I'm in love with him.
no, I don't think it's because i'm in love with him.
you know, I was in love with Derek. I was in love with mark, I think, even for a little while.
no, I think it's because sam's better than me.
he's a better person...
a genuinely... good person.
you don't think you're a good person?
or maybe it's just that thing he does with his tongue.
I woke up with a hangover this morning.
again.
and I'm just...
I'm over it.
this has to be it.
I don't know why I was able to put together almost a decade sober, and now I can't seem to make it past about 30 days.
this program gave me a life, and now I have a lot to lose, and, So I'm not drinking today.
I can't believe it is day one again.
I'm humiliated.
I'm humiliated that it's day one again.
but, you know, it's one day at a time, and, and I'm not gonna take a drink today.
Thanks.
sorry that I didn't get a chance to review your case with Dr. Reilly before the consult.
he has been so amazing.
he's really made me believe that having a child is possible, despite what the other doctors said.
Nina's been chasing that miracle since her mother died last year.
well, let's take a look.
okay.
it says here you were born without a uterus?
Yeah. I have Mayer-Rokitansky- Kuster-Hauser syndrome.
it's a mouthful, right?
but her ovaries are functional. That's the important part.
right, but you understand...
I mean, Dr. Reilly explained to you that you can't get pregnant?
you have to have a uterus to carry a child.
I know. That's why granny is giving me hers.
he's been waking up a lot at night, and, uh, he's a little fussier than usual.
any fever or runny nose?
no. But he was pulling his ear.
what if he perfed his eardrum? He could go deaf.
his eardrums are fine, and he is fine.
and... You are...
well, I, I may be going a teensy bit crazy from all the mommy-ness.
but it's a good crazy,'cause I have never had the chance really, you know, to be at home... All the time...
alone... With my 2-year-old son.
so it's a good crazy.
and, uh, you know, then there's Pete, my husband had a heart attack.
I mean, listen that sentence, Coop.
my husband had a heart attack.
my handsome, studly, virile husband...
you know what I think I need? I think I need a little perspective.
you know, from people who are doing what I'm doing...
mommies.
do you know any cool mommies with groups, mommy groups?
OK, first of all stop saying mommy.
and second of all, are you sure that that's what you want...
Yes, yes. I think it would be interesting and fun and, uh, come on, Cooper...
tell me where the cool mommies are.
I haven't been able to sleep since my heart attack.
I've tried everything... Meditation, self-hypnosis...
did you call any of the therapists I recommended?
now why would I waste my time talking to a total stranger?
I know you. - I trust you. - Yes, well, I'm flattered...
you're free. Pete...
look, do you know that a third of all quadruple bypass patients are dead within ten years?
well, those kind of numbers would keep most people awake.
look, it's normal to feel scared.
I'm not scared. I'm pissed.
I did everything right. I never smoked, I exercise,
I cut way back on red meat and dairy, decaf.
and now I eat broccoli. I hate broccoli.
how's violet handling all this?
Oh, she's terrified.
you can see it in her eyes. She thinks I'm gonna drop dead any minute.
Yeah, well, your heart attack was traumatic for her, too.
she'll relax when she's convinced that the family's no longer in crisis.
when will that be? - When you find another therapist.
Hey, can I get some of that?
Really? I've apologized, like, a thousand times.
I am truly, deeply, incredibly sorry, Charlotte.
what's going on now?
I did a thing.
a stupid thing. - Yes, a stupid thing...
that ended up saving a young girl's life. Okay?
and that is the very last time I'll defend myself, but come on, charlotte, you can't stay mad at me forever.
you broke into my computer and stole confidential information.
don't bet on it.
late night?
chief of staff and curfew police...
you're a busy woman. Good morning.
or not. - Don't mind her.
we're all really happy that you're here.
U promised a patient a uterine transplant?
what the hell were you thinking?
nice welcome wagon you got there. - It can't be done.
I did some work at the Mayo clinic on the procedural viability of uterine organ transplant, - and it can be done. - On animals.
it has been done on a human, just not with any long-term success.
well, somebody has to be the first, right?
Sam. - Thank you, Sam.
there is always a first, and nina's a perfect candidate. Ung, she's healthy...
she is grieving. Her mother just died. She's not thinking clearly.
look, I'm in no position to judge her motives, all right?
where would she get the uterus?
Oh, from her gammy. Yeah. Her 66-year-old grandmother who's probably not using it.
look, it puts both women through an unnecessary and risky surgery.
even if she survives, Nina would be on anti-rejection meds for months before you can do an embryo transfer and even then, her body can reject the uterus, endangering her and the fetus.
what about the obvious solution, you skip the surgery and adopt?
or you use a surgate. - That's not what Nina wants.
she wants to give birth to her baby like her mother did her.
it's not my place to judge that. It's my place to make it happen if I can, and I think I can.
if this works, we can make huge advances in the science of fertility.
the patient's aware of the risks, she has a donor lined up.
I'll take the shot. I think it's worth a shot.
now you want to stand in her way, or do you want to help her make a baby and help make history in the process?
you increased your dosage without talking to me?
well, I wasn't thinking about you so much as I was thinking about Eva.
Eva? - She's one of my kindergartners.
she's 5 years old.
things aren't so great at home so I spend extra time with her and I was having a real impact until...
my hand started tremoring, parkinson and she was fine with that, but then the... But then the jerking started, and then I froze in front of her.
and that was so scary for her. It was just awful.
so, yes, I increased my dosage.
but it seems to really be working because, you know, the symptoms decreased.
okay, but high doses of your meds have been known to cause pretty serious side effects.
they affect the limbic system, which is the area of the brain that deals with impulse control.
have you had any impulsive or compulsive behaviors...
gambling, risk taking, anything out of the ordinary?
my husband is having a checkup with Sam.
he's probably almost done, right?
your cortisol levels are way up. You're stressed.
my 40-year-old wife has parkinson's disease. That's a little stressful.
Yeah, I know. And you're doing a great job of taking care of her.
now you gotta take better care of yourself. You exercising?
yeah I-I definitely keep thinking about it.
Sam, what is it?
uh, I'm sorry, Will.
I got some bad news.
Laura, whatever symptoms you're having, I can help.
but I need to know...
are you having side effects, compulsive behavior?
Sam says I have gonorrhea.
I haven't had sex with anyone but you, Laura. Can you say the same?
Yes, Dr. Shepherd, I've been having side effects.
it started with a single dad of one of the kids in my class.
he came in for a parent-teacher conference...
and he's... Oh, he's very handsome, and I noticed that he was looking at my chest while I was talking, and the next thing I know, my hand is on his pants.
and then my hand is in his pants, and then we're doing it in the supply closet in my classroom on top of the chalk and the magic markers.
Yeah, so... I - I mean, it just...
it was that one time, and I swore, it will never happen again.
okay. Good. That's good, because we can contact him and we can have him treated for...
and then it happened again with the janitor in his supply closet, and then with the man who came to fix my dripping faucet.
your dripping faucet? - The plumber.
got that. - And I just... Do you think that's where the gonorrhea...
it's hard to say.
this... This is crazy. This is not me.
I am married to a wonderful, wonderful man and I can't lose him, and, god, I never wanted to hurt him, but I can't live with the tremors and I can't stop grabbing men's...
got it. Got it.
okay. Let's start with an S.T.D. panel and an H.I.V. test, and then we'll...
take it from there.
okay.
she didn't literally say "the plumber"?
he fixed her leaky faucet.
you think it's funny that your patient has destroyed a loving, long-term marriage with frequent and recurrent infidelity?
it's actually really sad, and I'm hoping that her husband understands that the drugs changed her brain chemistry, which changed her behavior.
I mean, he can't hold it against her.
hold it against her.
Oh, stop it, both of you.
so we're saying, infidelity gets excused when drugs are involved?
in this case, yes. - Come on.
isn't that a little like saying you can't blame a drunk driver after she totals another car?
a drunk driver chooses to get wasted. Laura did not choose parkinson's.
so Will can't blame her for side effects beyond her control.
that doesn't change the fact that she was out there fooling around with other men, and you're asking him to suck it up.
suck it up.
will is devoted to laura. And I think I can save the marriage.
how? - Deep brain stimulation.
Oh, why do you always want to do D.B.S? - For real, again?
because it works. It works.
I stimulate the brain, the parkinson's symptoms decrease, and the pornography is relegated to Laura and Will's television set.
D.B.S. is my magic wand.
I just kinda handed you that one.
you want to grab some lunch? - I can't.
then do you want to... mess around?
Yes. But... I have an appointment.
that you can't cancel? - That I shouldn't cancel. I'm...
I'm interviewing a couple of I.V.F. Specialists.
Sam, I didn't mean to...No, I didn't mean...Any other time... - No, no, that's fine.
any other time, I would. - That's fi... I get it. I- I didn't... I didn't have a condom on me anyway, so...
Sam, this is weird. - No, it's fine.
you... You do what you have to do. And it's... It's fine. Really.
yeah?
actually, I'm... You know, I'm excited about it.
I... I mean, I know I don't talk to you about it much, but I could if you want. No, no. You don't have to.
are you sure? - Yes, I'm happy for you. I am happy for you.
but this is your thing... And I...
Oh, sorry. - Am I, uh, interrupting? - No.
well, hey, that's a whole lot of uterine transplant research for someone who thinks it's a crazy procedure.
I am intellectually curious, but my opinion hasn't changed.
well, that's a shame in this case.
I mean, the guys on the transplant team, they're fine for the job, but I'd prefer you.
listen, Nina's checking in to the hospital tomorrow.
go talk to her.
if you're still not interested, I'll leave you alone.
promise?
you hungry? - Yeah.
Bonjour.
violet, this is Annette. She's Daisy's mom.
and this is Lynn. Little Hruman is hers.
and that handsome boy is my Leo.
what are you drinking, red or white?
don't mind Lynn. She just stopped breast-feeding, and so she's making up for lost time.
truman turned 3 and lost interest.
but we're still sharing a bed, so the bonding isn't interrupted.
Oh, you don't find that...
uh, I mean, a family bed, it's great for bonding, - but it can be a little tricky to, - For what, a sex life?
Yeah, honestly, that's not really on my list of priorities anymore.
so tell us about you.
Oh, I'm a... I'm a psychiatrist and... And a writer.
Oh, yeah, we all read your book. - Loved it.
Oh, thank you. Thank you, yes. It was actually kind of painful to get it all out, and, uh, plus, I was practicing full-time. So...
did you write it to help with the preschool apps? Genius.
no, I... Preschool? Lucas is only 2.
I'm sure that's fine, too.
did Leo make up with his cousin?
Yeah. The bite barely broke skin.
Leo bit his cousin? - It's just a phase.
actually, not when he's... How old is he, 5?
most kids outgrow that by the time they're 3, so when they're Leo's age, that can be a...
a way of getting attention or dealing with stress.
has he experienced any trauma lately?
we should get some snacks for the kids.
I can help. Oh, no, that's fine.
uh, why don't you just wait here?
he comes with a stocked bar. We definitely made the right hire.
I think your office is bigger than mine.
not that I'd want to put in a bar.
Gentles, thanks for taking me on. - And thank you.
his office is bigger than yours. - And he's got a bar.
sometimes, a woman needs a drink when you tell her she's infertile.
I know that's a little unorthodox, but , no, no, we're actually... We're pretty relaxed around here...
when Pete's not dealing with his heart attack by yelling at people...
and Violet's not frustrated that she's still suspended...
and Charlotte's actually speaking to me.
What'd you do?
why assume it's my fault? - 'cause it usually is.
okay, Jake doesn't know that. - Did you apologize yet?
repeatedly. - Did you mean it?
of course. - Well, it might be time for flowers...
or dinner. You guys know I'm married to Charlotte, right?
Charlotte Kng? - You know, apologies make sense to men.
find the problem, fix it, right? That's kinda how we're built.
but, For women, the words don't really mean anything unless they understand that you get where their heads are at.
I mean, relationships are philosophy to them, not science.
you just gotta get... Where Charlotte's coming from.
it's how I make my living. I'm in the business of knowing women.
kinda makes you sound like a pimp, though.
Yeah. - It does. Yeah, a little bit.
sorry that took so long.
I had to stop at the toy store to get some puzzles for Lucas and then I got stuck on a phone call.
I'm trying to get into a private mommy- and-me class that has a waiting list.
Where's Lucas? - I put him to bed.
according to Sam, I'm a fully functional adult.
fully functional? He said...
I'm cleared for physical activity.
all physical activity?
thank you, god.
who are you and what have you done with my husband?
I understand where you're coming from.
I get it. I get you.
you know, it's a, uh, it's a science, not a philosophy.
I mean, it's a philosophy, not a science, our relationship, and I just...
I hear you. And I understand.
and I am sorry for everything.
what exactly is it that you understand?
I have no idea.
which is why you're still sleeping on the couch.
are you really ready to just give up on 20 years of marriage without exploring every other option?
Laura loves you. That hasn't changed. Now the medication made her...
she had sex with strangers.
do you think the medication made her lie to me, too?
do you think it made her betray every single thing I thought we were about?
I don't know. I don't know how it affected her brain chemistry.
I don't know what was medication and what was choice.
but I think...
what I'm trying to say is that illness changes people, on the inside and on the out.
that's why the marriage vows say "in sickness and in health."
now I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.
what I'm saying is that you should hear dr. Shepherd out.
can I come in?
Yeah, I was just about to go buy some flowers.
I'm not gonna be any great shakes after surgery, so I want to make sure that Nina has something nice to look at.
see you later. - Okay.
any time I got sick as a kid, my mom cleaned my room and brought me flowers.
I didn't realize that granny had done the same for her.
it's a pretty amazing thing she's gonna do for you.
you think I'm crazy.
no. No, I don't. But this is...
it's dangerous. It is an experimental procedure.
you're risking hemorrhaging, organ rejection, and this is before you even get to implantation.
I know the risks. Dr. Reilly laid them all out for me, twice.
when I was younger, my mom worried all the time.
call me when you get there. Who are you going with? What time will you be home?
I just thought she was insane.
and every time, she said to me, "when you're a mother, you'll understand.
I want to be so close to someone that I know them from the moment they start growing inside of me.
I want a baby... My baby...
to love and protect and teach.
so when I read about Dr. Reilly's research...
it's not a guarantee that it will work. - But there are no guarantees in life.
but if something is worth having, you've gotta give it a try, right?
because if this works, someday when my kid is driving me insane with worry...
I'll finally understand.
so?
let's take the shot.
I'll implant an electrode where the nerve signals are generating your tremors.
I'm gonna be awake for this? Won't that hurt?
well, the brain has no pain fibers so all you'll feel is a pinch and a little vibration.
the electrode will connect to a wire that I will feed under the skin of your head, neck, and shoulder.
and then I'll place a neurostimulator under your collarbone, which will send electrical impulses to block the tremor signals.
with... With all the poking around in my brain, I mean, you could damage another part.
what if... What if I go blind?
Oh, there's no chance of blindness.
it's a very targeted procedure.
I know this is a lot to take in, but Dr. Shepherd is a very gifted neurosurgeon.
this could be good, Laura.
it could... get us back on track.
Yeah, but it's all... Really terrifying.
more terrifying than life without me?
look, I don't mean to... I'm scared, too, but you need this.
we need this. I need to be able to trust you again.
please. Have the surgery.
I could've been screwing anyone.
I mean, I'm with my wife, and for all I felt, I could've been screwing a prostitute.
it was like I was watching the whole thing. And...And I felt...
nothing, no connection.
sometimes sex is just sex.
Yeah, well, for Violet and me, sex is pretty much always about connecting.
I mean, last night was intense, but I-I don't know, it was different.
is there any other time when you felt that kind of disconnect from your life?
maybe in foster care when I was getting the crap kicked out of me.
did that happen a lot?
Yeah. When I was 13, I was put in this foster home.
they'd already taken in three other boys, and after the foster parents went to sleep, the boys would take me to the garage and just beat on me until they got bored or I was unconscious.
how did that situation resolve itself?
eventually, I fought back.
broke the biggest kid's nose, and they left me alone.
and that disconnection, do you think it was some kind of a coping mechanism?
to deal with my anger?
Sheldon, I wasn't angry that Violet wanted to have sex with me.
are you sure?
all right, come on, Luke.
you don't want to try the creamed spinach?
it's organic and filled with antioxidants. Come on.
don't you want to learn to read before Truman?
don't want it. - You don't like it.
could I have some of mine?
Yeah, yeah. All right. Okay.
I'm just trying to do what's best for you and for daddy.
Yes. - He seems good, doesn't he?
Yeah, which is weird because he was so angry and distant, but then...strangely hot.
although, detached and...
Yeah, this is a completely inappropriate conversation to be having with my son, which I'm only having because the other mommies wouldn't talk to me.
okay, you clearly don't want to eat, so you know what?
there is no reason we can't both learn to speak a new language.
all right?
el ni that means boy. That's you.
would you say el ni?
mama. That's me. Yeah.
Yeah, that's me.
And...Loco. - Loco?
that means crazy. That's how la madre feels.
Jake left you a bottle, too. - Yeah.
Yeah, he's cool. I like him.
you want me to take it for you?
that is a $100 bottle of pinot, Sheldon. Hands off.
I'll...I'll keep it for guests.
even sober people have dinner parties.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?
not at all, not at all. I was just leaving.
Laura, are you okay? - No.
I-I don't...Yes and no. I don't...
I - I'm not gonna have the surgery.
I get it.
it's really scary the idea of someone cutting into your brain.
Oh, no. It's not that. I mean, blah, but...
it's, uh, I don't...Want to give up my meds.
I don't understand. - I like my meds.
I love my meds.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be dense here, but we're not talking about opiates.
I mean, your meds aren't addictive.
it's not addictive that, for the first time in my life.
I don't care what other people think about me?
for the first time in my life, I'm completely uninhibited.
yesterday in the grocery store, I walked up to a man, and five minutes later...Five...
we were doing it in the back room where they store the produce.
that is addictive.
I mean, would you look at me? I'm a...
I'm a kindergarten teacher.
I haven't bothered to wax anything in ten years because who cares?
and suddenly...
suddenly, I feel sexy.
I feel alive.
Oh, god. I feel just connected to my body in ways that I forgot existed.
everything's changed.
I can't give it up. I - I don't want to go back.
your husband... - No, I-I will use condoms.
I mean, no matter what, from now on.
I will keep Will safe. I will. I will.
but you have to tell him that the surgery's not an option.
tell him that it won't work for me. Please.
please.
you know you sound a little crazy, right?
there is a certain high from the lack of inhibitions. I get that.
I really do.
but how much are you willing to give up to hold on to that high?
Dr. Shepherd, I have parkinson's. I'm dying.
I'm not quite 40 so......
I don't actually have all that much else left to lose.
violet. That's a radical change. You look fantastic.
Oh, yeah. Whatever. - Hi, baby.
I was bored. I am bored.
do you want to have lunch with us?
all right.
okay.
Lucas, auntie Addison is very, very hungry so I'm gonna go eat lunch with your mommy while you go and play with the pink whales in the sand. Wanna go play?
Hey, buddy. - All right.
good guy.
Yeah, go water 'em.
are you...
hiding?
I - I thought it was a woman from my mommy group.
you're in a mommy group? - I went once.
hated them all.
that's a lie. They didn't like me.
they're not even returning my e-mails.
so I chopped off my hair.
I see.
you're very polite.
well, I don't know what to say. I mean...
you and I, we work together, but it's not like we've ever been friends.
well, you used to sleep with my husband. You used to take care of my son.
I thought of anybody, you would to, you know...
all right, I think you're being ridiculous.
no. I mean, of course you don't like any of the mommies in the mommy group.
you have nothing in common with these women other than the fact that you all have children.
I mean, it would be like me...
being friends with every infertile woman in town just because we can't have kids.
Yes. Yes, yes.
God. I feel better. - Good.
you know, I mean, here I am, trying to have a baby, you know, without sam. And that's weird, of course.
obviously... - We were talking about me...Still.
we weren't done. - Right. Sorry.
I'm just...
I'm just really lonely, Addison. I am not a mommy-group mommy, and I'm not allowed to work, and my husband had a heart attack.
that's a scary sentence.
thank you.
do you want to be friends?
I mean, is that what this lunch is...
do you?
I like your haircut.
I...
I think it's great that you want to have a kid on your own.
yeah?
I'm lonely, too, you know? Without Nal, I'm really lonely.
So...We'll be friends.
we'll be friends.
Hey, sam.
Hey, how's your relationship going? Mine's great.
you should really think about...getting married.
did you schedule Laura's surgery yet?
she canceled it.
she is not interested in changing her behavior.
she wants to sleep around.
she even asked me to tell her husband that surgery is not an option.
well, you can't lie to the man.
I am well aware of that, Charlotte, which is why I'm saying nothing at all.
so what, Laura just gets a free pass to cheat on her husband?
how she chooses to live her life, that's her own business.
she's in a relationship. No, that's...
that's not right.
once you betray your partner's trust, it's hard to get it back.
you're a bitch to me and to Cooper.
who knew you had such range?
now that is a beautiful uterus.
nicely done. - Thank you.
what do you think about Joanie Matthews?
she's a bit of a...an I.V.F. mad scientist.
brilliant. Why? - I'm just looking around.
Dave Atkins? - he's real old-school...
warm, great bedside manner.
I think you should meet with 'em both.
in fact, why don't you send me a list of who you're looking at?
I'll vet 'em for you. - Thank you.
okay, ladies and gentlemen,
there we go.
damn it. Okay.
the internal iliac's retracted. I need to stop the bleeding.
we're gonna have to clamp the vascular supply proximally.
there's too much blood. I need you to clear the field.
damn it. Okay it's retracted too far.
I need to embolize the vessel.
cross her for six units and hang the f.f.p.
if you embolize the main vessel, it's gonna cut off supply to the transplant.
if I don't, I'll lose Nina.
come on, Nina. Hang in there.
hang in there now.
you fought one hell of a fight in there, cowboy.
lost, though. - Look, you tried, which is more than most doctors would've done.
it's more than I would've done.
you saved her life. That's a win.
not for me, it isn't.
there. - Yeah, silly po before you go, I was thinking, I want to give the nanny a few more hours.
I want to start another book. I think it'd be good for me.
Lucas is already gonna need therapy when he's old enough to read the first one.
come on, Pete. You're in the office every day.
you get to use your...Your training, your intellect...
every part of you is engaged.
and, uh, I want that, too. I need it.
I can't believe it. Already bored with motherhood.
you don't think that raising our child is important work.
Of...Of...Of course it is.
but I don't see why I have to do it to the exclusion of everything else.
and I think it's important that Lucas sees a woman who can work and be well-rounded and...
a 2 year old doesn't want well-rounded.
a 2 year old wants his mother.
so long, pal. Bye.
honey, it's not like I've been an at-home mother for the past two years.
why is it such a shock that I would want to work and raise my child?
what the hell is going on with you?
I'm late for work.
I'm sorry, Nina. I'm so sorry.
but we knew this was a long shot, right?
we knew that, but we tried anyway because that was important to you.
you're young, you have the support of your family, and you will be a mother.
we can explore surrogacy now or you can adopt.
but I wanted to be like my mom.
I know.
and if your mom were here right now, she would tell you that it wasn't giving birth to you that defined her.
it was the first time you looked in her eyes and smiled.
it was the first time you fell asleep on her shoulder...
and she'd barely let herself breathe because she never wanted that moment to end.
you will have your baby...
however she comes into the world, and you will love her incredibly well because your mom taught you how.
and that's all that matters.
okay? That's all that matters.
thanks for, Thanks for meeting me here.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, is there a reason we couldn't meet at the office?
well, I was just hoping to.
I guess speak to you as a friend rather than a-a doctor.
okay.
I - I don't understand why or how you could do this to Will.
well, that's because you and I aren't friends.
fair enough.
well, what about 20 years of marriage? That's gotta mean something.
okay. - So...
I'm just gonna say some things.
my husband won't have sex outside of the missionary position.
and if he finishes before I do, he rolls over and he goes to sleep.
early on in our marriage, when he caught me trying to finish after he was done, he called me disgusting. Disgusting.
so he has some issues.
in this particular area, he has issues.
and his issues have become my issues...
because that's what happens in a marriage.
that's right.
and he has no interest in dealing with those issues.
and for the first time, I understand that, because I have no interest in dealing with mine.
I mean, we make a great team.
on so many levels, we're...we're a great team.
So...Don't judge me.
please. You're not inside my marriage.
and you can't be inside anybody else's marriage, either.
y - you have to know that. Appearances...
they mean nothing, clearly.
look at me.
she leaves us every chance she gets for these rooms full of strangers, who are desperate to tell her what a difference she made in their lives.
violet decided to go on the book tour, huh?
she wants to write another book.
well, that's not the same thing.
well, it feels the same. - Don't be such a baby.
excuse me?
you want the benefit of my expertise, as a friend, without paying?
well, with that comes the truth.
what are you afraid of, Pete?
Sheldon, I worked in Bosnia in a war zone, I'm in the chaos of the e. r. every day.
I'm not a guy that gets scared. I told you. I'm angry.
I know what you told me, but a 14-year-old boy who's dumped with foster families isn't just angry.
and the disconnect you feel, that's not about anger.
so what are you afraid of?
I think you were right.
one of my favorite sentences in the world.
right about what? - About Laura.
I talked to her, and, uh, I guess it is her business, you know, what she's doing and what she tells Will.
it's not easy, but sometimes the truth is worse.
Yeah.
so I guess she'll have her high, he won't know, and hopefully...
it'll be better that way.
I'm drowning here, Charlotte.
and I obviously don't know what to do to save myself, and every time I try to say anything, it's like tying another cinder block to my ankle.
so...
if you just tell me what to do...
I will do it, whatever it is, happily.
seriously, come on. Tell...Tell me.
tell me.
tell me. - Stop it.
you made me be the sheriff with you.
it sucks being the sheriff, and I'm good at it.
everybody already thinks i'm the wicked witch of St. Ambrose.
everyone who? Everyone Amelia?
look, I don't care. It's fine. It's my job.
and the job isn't about making friends, but you're my husband.
don't make me be the sheriff with you, too.
look...
I don't regret...saving Kerri. I don't.
but I do regret not having your back.
I will never put you in that position again, and I will not make you be the sheriff.
we should be able to tell each other anything, right?
that sounds like the prelude to something bad.
no, no. No, it's not bad.
Sam. - I...
if you have something to tell me...
no. No, no, no. It's not me. It's you. It's yesterday.
you wanted to talk to me about the I.V.F. stuff, and...
I, uh, I cut you off.
and I'm sorry.
it's okay. - No, it's not okay.
we're together and, you know, we shouldn't have secrets or, you know, things that we're thinking about that we can't say.
agreed.
okay, good. So tell me...
tell me about the I.V.F., the doctors.
is there anybody that you like?
thank you.
but really, i'm fine.
okay.
I'm afraid you think i'm a bad mother and that you don't love me enough.
I'm afraid I'll die before I'm done raising Lucas.
I renamed the practice. Did I tell you?
seaside health and wellness.
I thought about calling it Montgomery wellness.
bizzy would've told me to do that.
I mean, it is all of my money funding the place now. But...
I didn't do it.
it is a cooperative practice, and the name reflects that.
a few years ago, I mean...
you would've gone with Montgomery?
Yeah.
I would have.
So...you know, no matter what, whatever happens, Sam has rubbed off on me.
his goodness, his kindness, his honesty, his generosity of spirit has rubbed off.
I do.
see you at lunch.
Cooper? - yes.
you don't remember me, do you?
no. I'm sorry. Have we met?
nine years ago. I was tending bar at the key club.
you came in, stayed till last call, we had sex in my s.u.v. in the parking lot.
Erica. - Hi, Erica.
Yeah, hi. Awkward.
I'm married now. - I have a son.
he's 8.
his name is mason.
and he's...And this is...
this is really not what I...
anyway...
He's...Well...
he's yours.
and I kept trying to tell myself that it was from something other than Sam, but I mean, come on.
how can I ignore the fact that my bed is half empty?
it's like this... Space that I can't... Occupy.
you know, it's his space. It's Sam's space.
he belongs there.
anyway, okay, so I'm up...
flipping around through the channels, and I came across this documentary.
what about?
the history of shin-kicking.
I had no idea that this existed as a sport.
I mean, for 400 years, men have been kicking each other in the shins, like, professionally.
what was so captivating about it?
I don't know. I...
I... I couldn't sleep.
seaside HEALTH WELLNESS - You're...you're right here? - Yeah.
no.
Sam and I broke up. - What?
I lost my boyfriend and my baby in one day.
and I-I haven't been sleeping much.
I'm sorry about you and Sam, really.
but you didn't lose your baby.
someone else got theirs. You'll-you'll get yours.
I mean, adoption's always on the table.
well, I'm not really interested in being picked over again.
well, there's always surrogacy.
I can get you a great donor egg and a healthy surrogate.
I'm tired.
all right. I know it's hard to think about now, but you do have options.
why not surrogacy?
you get your baby, and someone else's boobs take the hit.
because...
I've already... Jumped through a thousand hoops.
I don't think I could make it through a thousand more.
all right, tell me something...
to get my mind off this.
well... I'm staying sober.
I don't miss Ryan any less, but I'm sober.
he'd be proud of you.
I'm proud of you.
I overslept.
I turned your alarm off.
Why?
you think I didn't hear you two giggling with the TV on past midnight?
the cartoon channel was playing a pokemon marathon that Mason had never seen before. It was...pokemon: the rise of darkral.
you had no business keeping that boy up so late.
he is off from school today.
you are not.
Where's Mason?
he's in your office.
did he eat? - Yep.
I can crack an egg.
he's nervous about his spelling bee this week. I promised him - I quizzed him on the way in.
his toothbrush looked a little ragged, so we stopped off and got him a new one.
Erica will be by in a little bit to pick him up.
don't get used to it.
my partner and I were following a car that had just been involved in an armed robbery.
and all of a sudden, the guy ditches it and takes off.
so I went.
I cornered him, I drew my weapon, and he made a move for his waistband.
I saw a flash.
I reacted, I shot, and I killed him.
and it turned out he was unarmed, right?
Yeah, but the guy had just robbed a gas station...
with a gun, you know? So I assumed that.
of course, of course.
and now how do you feel?
like I followed protocol.
that's not exactly what I'm asking.
what I'm asking is how you feel about what happened.
look, what I did...
it's part of the job.
no, having to discharge your weapon isn't usually part of the job.
are you sleeping at night?
you know, I-I appreciate Joe, you know, sending me to somebody that he trusts.
but, um, I just - I want to get back to work.
well, it's tricky, getting back to work after something like this.
it can also put a lot of stress on your home life.
how are things there?
you want me to say that my-my home life sucks because nobody else gets me except other cops?
I want to know how you're handling it all.
in my job, I see things.
things that...I can't describe them... to my wife.
and when I get home...
sometimes, they're still in my head.
and you can't talk to anyone at work about this either.
you're not the first cop I've dealt with, I know what's the like?
so... You can talk to me.
how you guys doing in here?
Yeah, could you give us a couple of minutes?
I'd love to, Shelley, but I'm on the clock and I gotta get this kid home, so let's go.
Thanks, doc, really.
aaron and I were just starting to make some progress.
well, I appreciate you stepping up here, Shelley.
these in-house counselors, they're looking to cover their own asses.
I'm just not sure he's ready to go back.
you don't get over what he did in a week.
he did his job.
no, he killed someone in the course of doing his job.
it's-it's not the same thing.
look, a cop shoots an unarmed kid, everyone starts asking questions.
I'm less worried about how it looks than about where his head's at.
if you say so, Shelley, I'll make sure he sees a therapist.
heck, I'll even drive him down here once a week, after we restore him to active duty.
this I.A. Investigation hasn't wrapped, and, they catch wind of you not signing off on this kid right away...
you get my drift?
I think so.
you want me to say it's all right for him to go back to work even though I'm not comfortable with it.
I want you to help the kid out.
dragon. D- r-a-g-o-n. Dragon.
on fire.
okay, Coop. Retrieval.
okay, retrieval. R- e-t-r...
retrieval.
the new and undisputed spelling champion of the kitchen is Mason.
milkshakes before noon.
it's a special flavor Cooper made.
marshmallow cream, carmel syrup
secret recipe. Secret recipe.
you gotta try it.
it's sweet.
it's delicious.
delicious. D- e-l-i-s-h-o-o-s-h
I'm so sorry.
are you okay, mom?
well, looks like she will keep her finger, but...
your mom might need stitches.
stitches. S-t-i...t- c-h-e-s. Stitches.
I'll do it. You guys clean up.
St. AMBROSE HOSPITAL
Sam wouldn't even smile at me this morning.
I saw him draw his shades the other day, all of them.
well, your lives are very intertwined.
it-it's bound to be unpleasant.
I just wish I was sleeping.
you know, when pete first left, I wasn't sleeping, and then I started sleeping sideways.
I don't know. It was oddly comforting.
what do you do when the one person who can make you feel better is the one person who won't talk to you?
hell if know.
go to hell! - That must be my patient.
you're in the hospital Mr. Bauer. We're gonna take care of you.
go to hell! All of you, go to hell!
I am not supposed to be here! I have things
we found him on ocean avenue. He was yelling at a fire hydrant. - I have important people...
I am supposed to be meeting, and people are waiting to listen...
to what I have to say. - That's okay. That's enough.
it's okay. Let him go.
Hey, Mr. Bauer, Mr. Bauer, sounds like you're having a hard day.
I have a knife.
I have two knives, and I-I will stab every person in here who's looking at me right now.
I will stab you.
Mr. Bauer, you should know better than to talk that way.
you're scaring everybody.
what would your mother say if she heard you talking that way?
can I get 10 milligrams of haloperidol, please?
don't - Don't you come near me.
don't any of you come near me.
I am the only one that's gonna come near you, because I want to help you.
okay?
I know it's frustrating.
I know it's very confusing being in here, but I'm gonna give you some medicine, and you're gonna feel much better soon, okay?
everybody else is going back to work.
here it is.
can you do that yourself?
there you go.
good. There you go.
thank you. Thank you.
good job.
you're gonna feel much better soon.
good job.
any weakness in your hand before today?
it's just an old habit.
it's like a tick I picked up in middle school.
and the glass?
it seemed like you couldn't grip it.
it was just wet. It just slipped.
have you been having any headaches, dizziness?
I'm a single mom. I work 50 hours a week.
I get headaches.
I'd be happy to check you out.
I appreciate it, but I...
you know, I have my own doctor.
who has probably never given you a complete neuro workup.
you know, we could get you over to St. Ambrose.
I could give you an M.R.I.
it would take an hour or two, tops.
I don't really have an hour.
you just never know with these kind of...
look, I know it's what you do, but I just don't like being poked and prodded.
well, I didn't mean it like that.
no, it's cool.
just let it go. Okay?
done.
great. Thank you.
Hi. Dr. Turner?
hello.
I'm Scott Becker.
I'm the paramedic who brought in the guy you talked down yesterday.
Oh, yeah. Hi. - Hi.
what you did for him, that was really impressive. - Thank you.
Yeah, I see a lot of doctors here, but what y-you did was...
you're different.
I'm starting to sound ridiculous, so I was wondering if you'd be interested in going out with me sometime.
that's very sweet.
that was a tiny bit patronizing.
still, once you say yes, I guarantee you'll have a good time.
I - I am sure you're great.
this is just not the, the best time for me right now.
but, but thank you, really.
Oh, hey, Fellas.
Hey, Sam. I heard about you and Addison.
I'm sorry, man.
Yeah. You guys...We broke up.
Oh, man. You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. It was amicable, adult, made sense.
I had a dream last night that I ran her over, flattened her, like in a cartoon.
that's adult.
the mature way to do things is just...
untangle and move on.
good luck selling your house and finding a new job.
I've done this before, okay, with Naomi.
she's my ex-wife. She used to work here.
how'd that work? - He got involved with her best friend.
who, Addison?
Oh, man. You are a glutton for punishment.
the thing is, we broke up over a baby that doesn't even exist.
is she even gonna have one?
you better ask her.
Hey, hey, come on. Right now, this is a baby-free, estrogen-free zone.
look, I spent the whole weekend just sitting around, sitting around.
we need to go out. Let's-let's go out.
that's not a bad idea. Have some drinks.
right, some drinks?
all right, I won't talk about Violet, you don't talk about Addison, you don't talk about babies.
done. - Done.
all right. Bring it in.
I guess I'm just a little bit excited.
look, maybe the glass did just slip out of erica's hand, but she was flexing it earlier as if it were weak.
And?
and when I tracked her eyes, the right one was lagging behind the left.
these are serious neurological symptoms.
it could be a lacunar infarct, onset of M.S..
there a reason you're having this conversation with me instead of her?
I offered to do a workup. She shot me down.
maybe Cooper can convince her?
telling Cooper Will only have him jump to the worst possible conclusion.
so you just want to turn a blind eye to this and hope that nothing serious is going on?
I mean, that's your call, but if Erica strokes out and drives Mason off the side of the P.C.H..
what do you think you'll tell cooper then?
he shot and killed a man, Sheldon.
he's a good kid.
I - I'm not making a value judgment.
I'm just saying, he couldn't possibly be ready to go back to work.
if every cop with P.T.S.D. was benched, there wouldn't be any police left on the street.
well, well, strip all that away, okay?
Joe asking you the favor, the fact that Aaron is on the force.
what would you do?
I'd want him to get some help so he can work through the trauma.
exactly.
You-you-you have an opportunity to step up for Aaron in a situation where he may not be able to step up for himself.
or I could push the point, keep him off the force, and destroy his career.
well, that's what your cop buddy
I've been around enough cops to know that he's probably right.
so what? So you just check the box, you put Aaron back out onto the street, and you just hope he's stable enough to keep it together?
Joe said he'd make sure he gets some help.
does the police department seem like the kind of place where therapy's encouraged?
Hey, look, violet, with all due respect, I am not being naive, okay?
but I know Joe, and I have to make a choice.
I trust him or I put the kid in a position where he could lose everything.
well, shouldn't you be asking if the kid loses more by going back to work too soon?
I'm not gonna do this. - Okay.
it's lying. - It is.
and I just busted Cooper's butt over doing something like this.
Yeah, you did.
not to mention the fact that the patient involved specifically said she did not want this to happen, which makes it against the law and unethical.
why do I feel like there's a "but" coming?
this is Dr. Charlotte King.
I'm chief of staff at St. Ambrose.
we have a patient- Erica Warner Who just arrived in our E.R.
she was seen in your clinic a few months ago.
we need her medical records.
no, not everything, just...
head C.T. - Her most recent head C.T. and M.R.I. would be useful.
she's in a medically induced coma.
no next of kin.
so you're gonna have to wait on the consent forms.
look, we can debate this or we can do the right thing and save this woman's life.
courier's fine. Thank you.
I was completely clear
completely clear with Addison that I did not want a kid.
were you expecting her just to give up?
look, Sam was a good soldier, and we-we just-we know what happens to the good soldiers.
Yeah-what? What's that? - They... The
no, what?-They go missing. Good soldiers go missing.
and then their-their brothers have to go and get them.
I need another drink. What is going on?
Yeah, like-like Sam needs another awkward romance.
well, you know how
Oh, hey. Half an hour, I been looking for a drink. She goes right to Jake?
no, I-I'm fine.
well, if you need anything?
I - no, I need something.
impressive.
actually, she was.
for real? - Really?
come on. I gotta have a life outside of work.
apparently. - We gotta hang out with this guy more.
okay, okay, I'm-I'm a married man, but I'm just saying...
that pretty young lady over there just smiled at me.
all right.
Oh, no, no. She's - She's looking at Sam.
no.
Yes, She most definitely was. - Yes.
I think I'm gonna go over there.
Really? - Why? Why not?
cause you haven't picked up a girl since, like, middle school? - Yeah.
Oh, come on. I'm-I'm sure it's-it's just like riding a bike.
don't tell her he just learned last year.
my brothers, my brothers, let's mock him on the way out of battle, not on the way in. Okay.
thank you. I think I'm gonna be fine.
go get 'em.
who's gonna get the next round?
this is me.
you drinking bourbon? - Rye.
you drink rye on the rocks?
it's an old-fashioned.
but doesn't that usually have a, like, a cherry in it?
if you're a teenage girl...
or you take pride in sullying classic drinks.
maybe I'll try one.
no, don't. They're serving swill.
I'm in from out of town on a conference, wanted to go out, and I'm already regretting it.
Yeah, this isn't really my kind of place either.
so what kind of place do you like?
quiet, good music, and a great cocktail.
well, those places do exist in L.A..
if you have the time.
well, how about my room?
it's quiet, I have great music, and I have a killer bottle of bourbon.
unless of course you're a cherry-in-the-old-fashioned kind of guy.
are you really a doctor? - Yes, I am.
what kind? - I'm a heart surgeon.
the last guy I met said he was a big television producer. - Okay.
turns out that he's the guy who got the writers their frappuccinos.
so... - Well, I don't know what-How-how should-how do you want me to prove it?
how can I prove it to you?
what muscle is this?
For-okay.- Yes.
well, it's-that is the biceps brachii.
great.
there we have the pectoralis major.
and down there we have the transverse abdominis.
I could play this game all night.
right. Me, too.
I mean, I actually know all of the names of all the muscles, so...
that was too much, wasn't it?
it was a little. It felt weird coming out of my mouth.
you're hot, you cook.
are you married? - No.
you want to get married?
we could just pretend it's our honeymoon all morning.
I was kidding about the married.
Oh, okay. Oh, I know that. I know. I just...
I should probably get going to work.
do you want to hang out again? - Yeah.
no.
so what, are you- Are-you are married?
no, I'm not. I just...
I just got out of something.
and you're stuck on her?
she is stuck in my head.
I'm-I'm not s- I'm not stuck.
I - you know, I'm not the guy that just leaves without calling.
I mean, I always call. I've always called.
but I just...
you seem really great, and...
I just - I kinda want to know...
you know, what would happen if I decided to...
do things different than I've always done, because what I've always done...
doesn't seem to work.
again... It's too much.
I have something on my mind.
me, too.
you first.
no, you go.
am i, like...
if I wasn't your husband, and you saw me in a bar, would you hit on me?
I'm serious.
let me guess.
bachelors' night with the boys got you all nostalgic?
I do not miss being a bachelor, and I love being married.
but there was a lot of attention being doled out, and none of it was coming my way.
do I not give you enough attention?
that's not the point.
what is the point?
I'm not sure.
Cooper, you are handsome man.
now if you didn't have a ring on your finger, you'd have to beat those hussies off with a stick.
thank you.
would you have sex with me?
I am not one of those hussies. - Damn it.
you think we have enough space in the loft?
what do you mean?
well, Mason's been spending a lot of time there, and... I was thinking, you may want it to be more than just a weekend thing at some point.
I was looking on the internet, and there are these partitions we could install, in the living room maybe.
we could build Mason his own man cave.
he would love that.
so you're pretty into Mason these days?
are you feeling like a hussy now?
don't push your luck.
we've gotten threats.
the stuff in the papers...
everyone's trying to twist this around like Aaron's some rogue cop.
that must be hard. - Yeah.
we'll be fine.
do you want to know what he did that day before the shooting?
he drove a kid from corner to corner to find his mom because she left in the middle of the night to buy drugs.
that didn't make the papers.
he's a good man.
he doesn't deserve this.
Oh, Sissy, can you...
okay.
So...What have you decided?
I'm sorry, Aaron.
I don't think you're ready to be back on the street.
I am ready.
I am.
please...
let me get back to work.
I know it must feel like the whole world is watching you maybe even against you, but you can't worry about Sissy or Joe or anyone else.
you've had a major trauma, and I think it's important that we continue to talk about this.
no, no. You don't understand.
you know, growing up, the cops in my neighborhood were jerks...
just because they could be.
you know, and I-I thought...
I thought I could be a better cop, a better person than that.
you see, I don't know how to sit around my house.
I know how to be a cop.
okay, I want to get you to the point where you can do your job and still have a healthy outlook for your emotions.
how is that possible?
without work to keep my focus, all I do is sit around and I replay that night.
and what do you see?
I see his face.
that's natural.
you didn't have a choice.
it's okay to let yourself off the hook, Aaron.
is it?
you can talk to me.
I see his face, Dr. Wallace.
it was dark.
there was a shadow.
I got spooked.
and when I opened my eyes, he was on the ground.
and I told the investigators he reached, but...
it's okay.
I was scared.
I was scared.
and now I can't get his face out of my head.
I am sorry.
I am so, so sorry.
I just spent two hours on the phone trying to convince Aaron not to quit.
I said I needed more time with him.
shut the door.
I thought you'd do right by him.
you thought I'd rubber stamp him.
you knew that his story was bogus.
this guy Aaron shot, he was 19 years old.
but you probably read that, right?
you know what you didn't read?
the first time he comes to the system, he's 11.
he beats up an old man at a bus stop for $9.
9 bucks, Shelley.
three years in juvie where he distinguished himself by his ability to make shanks.
he almost killed a kid in there.
now six weeks after he finally gets out, he robs a liquor store, and the list goes on and on.
and you think that justifies my lying to protect Aaron?
you think you're protecting him by keeping him off the street?
I'm telling you, only way this kid makes it is by putting on his uniform and gettin' back out there.
no, you are wrong, Joe. He is not doing well.
none of us are doing well, Shelley.
that's the joke.
it's a brutal job, and we do the best we can.
but if we were to stop and think about what we do and why and try to make some sense of it, you'd have a line of us outside your door a mile long.
well, then maybe I should have a line.
aaron doesn't go back to work until I say so.
what am I looking at?
a gliosarcoma.
neuro docs go their entire careers without ever seeing one of these, and I sniffed it out while suturing a hand.
well, congratulations. What does it mean?
I mean, these things are nasty.
they're the only tumor that can actually push out of the brain through the skull.
and if the cells come into contact with any other part of the body, the tumor grows there, making them nearly inoperable.
how long?
I'd need updated scans, to be sure, but we're talking a few months.
I mean, this-this specialist gives her...
six to nine.
is there anything you can do?
no.
I called you last night.
you left, uh, bonky bear at your place.
Yeah, I know. I saw. I was out with, Jake and Cooper.
we were trying to get Sam's mind off of Addison.
how'd that go?
it's Sam. I mean...
I know. Addison is not a bastion of mental health these days, either.
the next two people who get together at this practice
should be fired immediately.
so how was it?
what do you mean?
last night. The boys' night out.
Oh, oh, it-it was good. Fun. Yeah.
what?
what did you think I meant?
nothing. I...
what did you do last night?
Violet-- No, no, no, no, what?
were you with someone?
Oh, god. You were with someone.
go ahead.
with what? - With your objection to me seeing other people while we're separated.
how old is she?
violet, do--No, no, really. Really. Was she a waitress - or was she one of those little girls that goes to the clubs all the time? - Stop deflecting.
I'm not deflecting.
congratulations on your... Whatever it was.
so you're okay if I see other people?
we're separated, right?
okay. I'll bring by bonky bear tonight. - Okay.
did you know all the guys went out last night?
Really? - So Sam could get his mind off you.
that's why he didn't come home.
I was up all night again.
I did not hear the garage open, I did not see the lights go on.
I feel like Pete is using this separation to have the bachelor party that he never had.
you know, he wants to sow his wild old oats.
he told you that? - Yeah.
I pretended not to care.
do you?
well, I don't want to. I mean, intellectually, I- I understand where Pete is coming from.
but emotionally, I...
I haven't processed him being with other women yet.
does he think our marriage is over?
maybe he just has a different idea of what separation is, you know?
you prefer sleeping sideways.
he prefers... sowing his wild, old oats.
a part of me hopes that Sam moves on, you know?
I mean, I wonder if...
I didn't hold him hostage, you know?
I mean, with all the baby stuff.
well, you're trying to be happy.
maybe Pete is, too.
Hey. What's up?
I know about the tumor.
what? How? - I know.
I just... I know.
you have no idea what you're talking about.
I do.
you need help.
no. What I need is time, and I'm not gonna waste it chasing some cure that doesn't exist.
you have to tell Cooper.
look, I don't have control over what this thing is doing to my brain, but I have control over when I tell mason and destroy his childhood.
he won't say anything. - He won't have to.
he'll just look at him like a kid whose mom is dying, and mason will know.
look, I understand that.
I do.
but you are family to Cooper now.
he needs time to prepare.
you need to listen to me.
you are gonna keep your mouth shut, because if you mention one word of this to Cooper, I will take my son and disappear, and Cooper will never see him again.
nice.
nice.
Hey, come here.
put your two fingers over the seam, and let your wrist roll over it.
got it, dad.
teaching them the curve? - Yeah.
used to be enough to take my mind off of things.
Yeah, well, silence has a way of eating at you till there's nothing left.
I think what you need to consider is whether you can keep this one inside and still be the man and the cop that you want to be.
if I rat myself out, I'll be letting everyone down.
look, Joe would never talk to me again.
Yeah, maybe.
my father was a brilliant surgeon, one of the best in his field.
and I wanted to be that, too, right? For him.
but I failed in the worst possible way.
I mean, imagine trying to be a world-class surgeon when you...
you can't stomach the sight of blood.
coming to terms with the fact that I wasn't gonna be the person he wanted me to be, it was hard.
I won't lie to you.
but I'm better for it.
Yeah, well...
I wouldn't know how to do that.
well, I do.
if I don't sign off on your psych eval, you're off the force, at least for a while.
it'll make getting back on very difficult, maybe impossible.
but if I do it...
it's not the best way, because at the end of the day, you're the one who has to live with it.
you still sulking?
I'm not sulking.
too much energy.
I am too far past exhaustion to sulk.
looks like sulking from here.
you know what you are?
you're a peddler...
a baby peddler.
is that right? - It is.
and you're probably here to give me some sort of pep talk where, to summarize, you'll tell me to get back on the horse.
you're a peddler.
are you getting back together with Sam?
why would you ask that?
well, you gave Sam up because you wanted a baby.
and if you're not getting back together with him, then a baby is still what you want.
give me your hand.
what? - Until you have a baby, I consider you my patient.
give me your hand. - Okay.
I have heard every word of this before, and I have told women when it's time to throw in the towel, and you are not there yet.
You're...not even close.
if you want this, we can make this happen.
I- I know you've felt alone in this before, but you don't need to feel that way anymore, because you've got me.
I will always be there, Addison.
you say that to all your patients?
not all of it.
I...
just almost fell asleep.
you got some balls.
I came for Aaron.
Oh, you've already done enough for him.
he's giving himself up in there. You know what that means?
if he's lucky enough to somehow avoid prison, he loses his badge, his pension, and everything he's ever worked for.
he'll be lucky to wind up flipping burgers in some fast-food joint.
you screwed him.
and you screwed me. - We've been friends a long time, Joe.
well, not anymore.
next time you need a cop, don't call me.
this is the right thing to do, whether you see it now or not.
you stealing supplies?
Oh, hey.
what are you doing here?
I...
I was gonna say that, uh, I was here to see Mr. Bauer, but really, I was, hoping to find you.
that's very sweet.
I'm assuming you're not being patronizing.
well, I was wondering, is it too late for me to take you up on your offer?
I need to finish stealing supplies for my rig and take a shower.
give me an hour?
okay.
will you help me find a surrogate?
Absolutely.
so they really called you "bus"?
my brother is older, and he and his friends used to play tackle football out behind our house, and I always wanted to play as the younger brother, but, you know, my mom said, "you're too young, you're gonna get hurt," and ...
so one day, I went, I put a bucket over my head...
and I just ran out on the field, and I-I said,"I'm gonna bus 'em."
I'm gonna bus 'em up.
and so the name "bus" was born.
I broke my collarbone that day.
needed to have surgery.
how old are you?
I'm 29.
Comrade. C- o-m-r-a-d-e. Comrade.
did I get it?
sorry.
knocked you out again.
all right. I don't think I can take any more tonight.
why don't you get washed up, and we'll watch a little TV, okay?
what's going on with you?
usually you love to watch me get thrashed by an 8 year old.
I'm just...
I'm tired.
what's wrong?
I love you.
what's going on?
Where's my dad?
he'll be back in a minute.
you want another word?
sure. - Okay.
the word...Is acceptable.
acceptable. A- c-c-e-p-t-a-b-l-e. Acceptable.
how you been？ - Okay.
you?
I haven't been sleeping.
me either.
I mean, the winner was literally hobbled by the end.
and he did this all for 50 bucks and a boot filled with beer.
I mean, the guy is either a glutton for punishment or...
or he just really likes drinking beer out of a boot.
which do you think it was?
I don't know.
both...
I guess.
I guess if you want something badly enough, then maybe getting your shins pummeled is a fair price.
I want a baby.
I'm gonna have a baby.
organic chemistry, physics 2, multivariable calculus, conversational french, introduction to the modern european novel, uh, tennis, you took all those classes in one semester?
Yes. My textbooks that fall cost as much as a small car.
but I wanted to graduate in three and a half years, and I was interested in all of them.
it sounds overwhelming.
it was.
Corinne? Corinne, it's your brother...Sam.
What-what-what do they have her on?
she was deranged when she came in. The shrink's got her loaded up.
So...It was actually- It's-it's actually a physical book?
Yeah, yeah, with every student's face in it.
like a phone book? No computer?
that's right, young man.
Yeah, it was great. You could...
look up the cute guy in your comparative literature class and call him when you were drunk.
what cute guy? How cute?
not as cute as you. - I'm not cute.
you're cute. - I'm tough.
you're tough. - I'm a tough guy.
sorry I called. - No, no. I'm glad you called.
I'm s- I'm sorry I don't have any words of wisdom. I d
Yeah. - Gosh, you look so sad. You look like a little boy.
it's 20 years, Addison. Just picked up and left.
no good-bye, no...She was just gone.
I know. I mean, I don't know.
I know what you told me. - No call, no letter...
I thought she was dead.
Yeah, but it's good news, right, that-that she's not, that she's back now?
Corinne. Can I get you something?
thirsty.
Hi, Corinne. Um, I'm...
Sam's neighbor, and we work together also. I'm Addison.
here's your water, Corinne.
here are your meds. You want to take this for me?
I'm not so sure. - Not so sure?
that this is good news.
he won't stop screaming.
I know babies cry, but it's been, like, 14 hours.
he won't eat. He can't sleep.
hyperactive reflexes, increased muscle tone. He's tachypneic.
pulse ox is borderline.
can't you give him something?
we will, after we diagnose what the problem is.
Eli's pretty small for 10 days. Was he premature?
how many weeks? - Um, like, two?
are you asking me? - No. Sorry.
it's just the screaming. I - I haven't slept. It was two weeks.
he came two weeks early.
he looks malnourished and dehydrated. Is he eating?
are you breastfeeding? - No. Um, uh, he likes the bottle.
pumping or giving him formula? - Formula.
and why is that? - What?
uh, most mothers try to breastfeed at least for a little while.
was he having trouble latching or
why does it matter? Just help him.
Denise, I gotta say, you look pretty good for someone that gave birth ten days ago.
this isn't your baby, is it?
okay, you need to explain what's going on right now or we're going to security.
okay. - Wait.
so Eli is your brother?
she gave birth to him, brought him home, and then left to score.
he was 2 days old, but it-it's been over a week, and she hasn't come back.
did you try to find her?
no, but- - Do you know if she's okay?
I never know if she's okay. The first time she left me, I was 8.
I woke up one morning, went downstairs, and there was no one. The house was empty.
I didn't know what to do, and-and I was scared, but I didn't want to be alone, so I toasted a frozen waffle and I got dressed and I went to school.
she came back a few days later.
she said she got stuck at work, but she worked in some office, and so it didn't make any sense.
but then she acted normal, so...I did, too.
I just-I didn't want it to happen again.
but it did. - Of course.
sometimes, she would tell me that she was leaving. Other times, she'd just be gone.
eventually, when it got really bad, one of my teachers figured it out.
and that was the first time I was put in foster care.
after that, it...It was just a lot of back and forth.
Eli doesn't deserve that. He should have someone who can take care of him...Always.
and that can be me.
how you feelin'?
ten minutes into my first session of chemo?
probably better than anyone else in here.
well, you got the right attitude.
do you want me to bring mason in?
no. I don't want him to see me...Or anyone else in here.
it'll just be too much for him.
okay. If that's what you want.
it's what I want. He's my little boy.
I've been the only constant in his life.
so if this is scary for me, then for him...
it's what I want.
come on. - I don't know. "e"?
I already said there's no e's. Come on.
look, can I please see my mom now?
well, maybe in a few minutes. She's, uh, she's still resting.
I really just want to see my mom. - I know
Hey, guys. - Hey, man.
Hey, Mason.
So...how is your, uh...
give me a minute, okay? I'll give you a hint. There's a "k" in there.
so Mason doesn't know about his mother?
no. Erica won't...
and, you know, ant me I've gone along with that because he's just a kid.
he's probably not ready to deal with his mother's death.
I mean, hell, I'm not ready to deal with it.
Yeah, well, losing a parent - I know how hard that is. At least he has you and Charlotte.
Yeah. - Yeah.
Erica says no
Mason, I'll see you later.
all right. Any ideas?
why is my mom resting so much?
she's still really tired from the accident.
the last time I saw her, she didn't look tired. She looked fine.
Yeah, but - I know she wants to see me.
I really want to see her. Please.
we just have to give it a little more time.
could I ask you a favor? - You can ask.
I want you to take me off the surgical rotation for a couple of days.
I'm researching gliosarcomas and I have a few leads, but I-I need more time.
Erica agreed to do the chemo.
beyond that, I don't think she's holding out any hope.
which is realistic, but I'm not ready to give up yet. - What does that mean?
it means, I need to keep reading and talking to more docs and...
I don't know where you find miracles these days, but I would like to try.
Yeah.
you were right. Baby Eli has neonatal abstinence syndrome.
we should start a methadone taper.
unfortunately, there's more.
he's also got a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation.
it needs to be removed immediately or his lungs are gonna be compromised.
you can't do surgery, right? He's too weak.
well, waiting carries its own risks.
I mean, any little virus or a cold, he could become oxygen deprived.
who makes this call? - I don't know.
is there a father in the picture?
no, just the baby's sister-denise.
how old is she? - 19.
and she also went through hell with the mother, but...
but she's trying to do right by her brother and...
she's a little young. You think she's qualified to make that kind of decision?
she doesn't have to. This is Eli's mother - Melissa.
did I leave to score drugs right after eli was born?
Yes, I did. But I changed my mind.
Oh, so where were you? - Getting clean.
you went to rehab? - No, ma'am. I did it myself.
she locked herself in a motel room for eight days and detoxed cold turkey.
well, that would've been great before she got her fetus addicted to opiates.
okay, cooper - No, you're right. But I got clean.
okay, due respect, you've been clean for what, eight days?
but you've been an addict for - I don't need you to tell me about addiction.
okay, I am trying for Eli.
I am doing everything that I can because I am gonna be a good mother to him.
you walked out on him. - No, I didn't. I left him with denise.
and I called over and over, only denise never answered, and she never called me back.
so denise is lying?
she has issues...With me, all right? And I know why.
there's lot of times I wasn't any kind of mother to her.
but this is not the same thing. It isn't.
I went to get clean. It was miserable. I- I-i...
day after day, shaking and sweating and wanting to die, but I did it for Eli, because he is my second chance, and I am not gonna screw this up.
how did you find her? - I called her cell phone.
okay, so what? She left her newborn to get high.
but she didn't get high. She got clean. And that means something.
you know how hard it is to detox cold turkey?
Yeah, and it was admirable that she was able to do it, but does that mean that she's able to take care of Eli and all the problems he has?
Denise is. - She's a kid, cooper.
Cooper, really? Does Denise have an apartment, a job, somebody to help out with Eli?
you guys, there are plenty of single, competent teenage mothers in the world.
with a sick baby, it's just...
okay, guys, you know what? We're not gonna solve this. We gotta call d. c.f. s.
well, melissa's better than the system. - Denise is better than melissa.
I am calling social services.
how do you feel about new zealand?
right now, anything farther than the bathroom seems intimidating. why?
there's a doctor there who's doing experimental treatments on gliosarcomas.
they're called intracranial microcapsules, which basically just means that they're
sorry, no. Thank you, but, no.
I can't just get on a plane and fly halfway around the world for...Whatever that is.
it might be nothing, but it might be something, and the point is, we won't know until we get on the ground and really start
Amelia. I agreed to do chemo. I'm fighting.
other than that, I don't want to do anything that's gonna sacrifice time with Mason, especially getting on a plane to fly somewhere for someone to do a surgery on my brain, a surgery that I might not wake up from.
I'm sorry. I can't.
three times. - Three times? Oh, I hate you.
Yes, well, I would...Hate me, too.
look at you. You're all..."Violet got her groove back.
Yeah. Who would've thought my groove was in this 20-something paramedic with these abs carved out of marble and this back...
Oh, my god, his back. - It's just like you ordered him.
like you called up a catalog and asked for those exact specifications. I want that catalog.
you know, I've never done this before. It's-it's just sex.
it's just pure, mind-numbing sex. Maybe guys are right, you know?
maybe "no strings attached" works.
every time I sleep with someone, we wind up in a pit of despair...Together, stuck.
stop. - I'm serious.
all this makes me miss sam. - Oh, you miss sam or you miss sex?
both. You know, the irony has been that the harder I tried to have a baby, the less I actually had sex.
it's been months, which is probably why I threw myself at jake.
what? - In palm springs.
I drank a bunch of martinis and the next thing you know, I wound up in his bed.
Addison. - He turned me down, you know, which I respect and hate.
Oh, I miss sam.
lazy. - What?
lazy. It's lazy. It's - It's more than lazy.
you know, it's-it's infuriating. - Sheldon
she's stoned, Sam. She's not medicated. She's not even properly diagnosed.
I mean, look, I understand the pressure the prison shrinks are under.
I do, but your sister is just stoned on a cocktail of antipsychotics and sedatives that would leave a large circus animal glassy-eyed and affectless.
okay, look, there might be a silver lining here.
okay, we don't know what Corinne is like under all those meds.
and once we get her off them, you might actually be able to find your sister in there somewhere.
you want to take her off her meds? - Yeah.
cause the prison guard said that when they brought her in, she was deranged.
Deranged" is not a diagnosis.
okay, look, I just want to get her off the meds long enough to see what's going on with her. Okay?
can we do that? - Please. Okay.
so sheldon took her off her meds?
Yeah, temp-temporarily.
well, did she...I - is she any different?
uh, not much. Not yet.
apparently, they had her pretty zonked out.
we're gonna have to wait for it all to wear off.
but sheldon canceled all his patients, said he would spend the day with her, try to make a real diagnosis.
and then what?
I don't know. I just... I don't know.
did you call your family, your mom?
no. I...I'm taking this thing, like, a minute at a time.
and I can't look ahead. I just... I don't know.
that's not your job anymore, you know, to, uh, take care of him, to worry about him.
he's my friend.
he'll be your friend again someday, but right now, he's mostly just your ex.
I mean, you still want a baby, right?
I know you needed a break, but has anything changed?
no. I still want a baby. - Then right now, sam is your ex.
you try to pretend he's your friend, and, uh...
and what? - And you hurt worse.
I know he's having a tough time right now, but he has other friends, and...
and I would hate to see you hurt worse.
I gotta go to the hospital.
I'm...I'm putting my foot down. We're staying on the bed next time.
Why? - I'm gonna die from rug burn. That's why.
why do we have to lie down at all?
Oh, you're trouble.
you kids got a hall pass?
should I...Uh, if I'd brought him in earlier, would he be okay?
Oh, Denise. It is not your fault.
I just want to protect him, you know? - I know you do.
why are you here? - Denise, she just wants to be with her baby.
Mommy-mommy's here, Eli. and I am never leaving again, ever.
liar. You're a liar.
you're gonna do to him exactly what you did to me.
and he is gonna end up exactly like I did... - No, no.
bouncing around, scared and alone.
I am clean now, okay? - Okay, okay, come on.
you can't do this here. - You- I got clean.
Oh, right, until Eli cries or you have a bad day at work or some guy dumps you.
that's all it's gonna take. Look, I will not let you hurt him.
you are damaged and you're bad
I have - I have a problem, okay? - Denise and Melissa, we're going outside.
and I am fixing that problem. - You need to go outside right now.
for the first time in my life, I have a reason to fix it.
Oh, so I wasn't worth it?
Oh, my god. What What- - Get Dr. Montgomery.
what is-what is happening? - Eli's crashing.
his sats are dropping. - What does that mean?
his oxygen is low. He's having trouble breathing.
intubate. - Don't. Don't.
well, he's not getting air. We have to intubate. - No, we can't.
intubating will increase air trapping in the damaged area of the lungs.
it'll make things worse. We need to get him to the o. r. Now.
no, but Dr. Freedman said that he's not strong enough for surgery.
let them do their job. - You don't know what you're talking about.
surgery might kill him, but not doing surgery will kill him.
this is completely your fault. - Denise!
it always is! - Enough!
move out of the way. now!
I don't want to die. But you must die.
all right, time for all monsters to get off the table. Dinner is ready.
I'm not hungry. I just want to see my mom.
I made you mac and cheese. That's your favorite, right?
Charlotte, I really just want to see my mom.
I know you do, but visiting hours are over for tonight.
but you're in charge there. You can take me.
well, your mom's still resting. - She's not this tired.
everyone keeps saying that, but she's never this tired.
tell me what you think of the mac and cheese.
this isn't right. It's not how my mom makes it.
well, there's macaroni and there's cheese.
I don't want this. I want to see my mom!
Mason, I know you're upset, and you've been through a lot, and you're worried about your mom, but that does not mean that you can act like you...
thank you. - How's Eli?
uh, Addison's still working on him.
she's isolated the main bronchus, but she hasn't done the lobectomy yet.
but... that kid's a fighter. I think he'll be okay.
Hey, man, I know that, uh, we disagree about Melissa and Denise, but let's not let it become a thing, okay?
it's not. It's not a thing.
you sure? - Yeah, it's just...
my... my mind is on Eli, I'm walking down the hall, and I see Violet making out with her boyfriend.
it's annoying. - Yeah. Well...
Yeah, well... what?
well, I mean, you guys are separated, right?
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that I want to see her fooling around with someone that I have to work with in my workplace.
well, I mean, you might not want to, but isn't that, like, the next step?
I mean, you move on, she moves on.
okay. Let's just say that you and Charlotte split up, and she starts dating some hot male nurse.
would you be cool with that just 'cause you had a few nights of unattached fun?
I don't know how I would feel. - Yes you do.
Ah, speak of the devil. Hello.
I turned my back for one second, Cooper. One second, and he was gone.
what? - Mason.
what? Where are you?
he just ran out the front door. Now I'm out lookin' for him.
well, how long has he been gone? And how far did he get?
I'm trying to figure that out.
okay, I'm calling-- I'm calling the police.
give me five minutes to look. If I can't find him by then, I'll call.
are you feeling better? Clearer?
a-a little.
Corinne, have you ever been formally diagnosed?
schizophrenic...
manic depressive...
paranoid delusions...
every jail, every nuthouse, a different shrink had a different idea.
I'm thirsty.
you're just coming down off the haloperidol.
here. Have some water.
Sam, come in. - All right.
Hey, Corinne.
Corinne has given me permission to include you in her sessions and to disclose what she's sharing.
isn't that right, corinne?
sure.
bathroom. - Sure, sure.
it's out the door, down the hall, on the right. Okay? Easy.
thank you.
I was wondering what you remember. You-you grew up with corinne.
for purposes of diagnosis...
what I remember.
uh, okay. I, uh, I remember her being...
you know, the life of the party until...She was the death of it.
can you explain that? - Uh, she was wild.
she was wild. She was, uh, she was funny, she was loud.
always dancing on tables...
uh, until she would fall off the tables.
she, uh...She almost burned the house down.
intentionally? - No.
she was-I think she said, she was making popcorn and the oil caught fire.
I remember her saying that she thought it looked cool.
so instead of trying to put the fire out, she started fanning the flames to make it bigger.
luckily, I knew where the fire extinguisher was.
was she drunk or high? - I never could tell.
you know, she was just...She was just wild.
and then...
a- and then what? - And then she would turn.
you know, all of a sudden, she would think the whole world was against her.
I put out her fire, like, literally.
I - I stopped her from burning down the house, and - and? - and...She cried for, like, three days straight.
she, uh, she threatened suicide. She accused me of hating her and...of wanting her dead.
she was not easy to live with.
she's my sister, and I love her.
but when you say that she's in there somewhere...
I don't know how I feel about that.
look, it's, uh, it's been a long day.
do you mind if I just take her home and we can continue this tomorrow?
sure. - All right.
I appreciate it. - Yeah.
Cooper. I found him.
you know, when I was a...A little bit older than you are, my cousins used to go hang out at the river with their friends.
and I was just desperate to go.
but every time I asked my daddy, he said no, I wasn't old enough.
so one weekend I snuck out, hitched a ride, and went to see what all the fuss was about.
and you know what? My daddy was right.
it was a whole lot of...Well, big kid stuff...
that I wasn't ready for.
so what I'm trying to tell you is, sometimes, when you really want to do something.
is my mom dead?
because no one's letting me see her, and when my nana went into the hospital...
she never came out.
Oh, honey.
what's up? - Nothing. I,uh...
well...I saved a baby today.
Oh, yeah? That's good. Yeah.
and I was at home, I couldn't sleep, and I saw your light on. I wanted to, uh...
I wanted to make sure you were okay.
Where's Corinne?
she's asleep. - Yeah?
I'm sorry. How did charlotte lose Mason?
Mason was very upset, and he just slipped out the door when she wasn't looking.
I need to see him. - Okay, charlotte's bringing him.
now. - mom.
I thought you were dead. - I'm not. Of course I'm not.
are you gonna be okay? - Yes, baby.
mommy's gonna be just fine.
you don't have to leave, you know.
nothing's changed, sam. I mean...
nothing's changed, so...I do have to go.
look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
no, no, don't be sorry. I'm not sorry.
I just have to go.
I'm gonna check on you, too. I'm worried about you.
I wish I could say you didn't have to be.
but honestly, I'm a little worried about me, too.
you don't like me very much.
well, I don't really know you.
uh, the only thing I know about you is that the first thing you did after your baby was born was leave to get high, so...
I was jonesing. He was screaming. I...
I - I just had to get away, and drugs are how I've always done that.
and, uh...Now it's gonna be different?
how do I answer that?
I want to say...Yes, that I would die before I'd hurt Eli the way I hurt Denise.
but you're gonna tell me, i'm an addict and addicts slip.
what do I say to that? It's true.
but ths time...I'm gonna do everything I can for that boy.
do you have any idea how lucky you are to even have that choice to make?
Eli could've died from the drugs you were doing when you were pregnant.
his lung condition could've killed him right after he was born.
D. c.f. s. Could've taken him when you were gone.
you could've had a bad reaction when you were detoxing.
I mean, frankly, it is a miracle you're both even here right now.
and most parents... Believe me, they don't get miracles.
I know. I screwed up.
but I am making a choice, and this time, I am choosing Eli.
good. I hope so.
I mean, being a parent, a good parent, that is an all-day, every day job- Every single day.
I am not kidding myself. I know it's going to be a fight every day, like you said.
and I'm...I'm gonna fight.
and what about Denise?
Maybe...I don't know.
maybe it's too late for us. I don't know.
I mean, I hope that it's not, but I learned on Denise.
and this time, I am gonna do it right with Eli.
I - I know that I left once.
and I'm sure there is a better way to do what I had to do, but...
at least this time, even though I did the wrong thing, it was for the right reasons.
it really was.
look, I believe in second chances. I do.
but I don't know if I can trust this woman. She's been sober for eight days.
it's not enough time. Not by a long shot, right?
well, maybe Melissa doesn't have to raise Eli all by herself, you know?
maybe she can ask for help. Denise cares, right?
she does, but...I mean, you should see these two people together.
well, you should see me and Pete together, you know?
but kids are an exception.
if there's one thing that Pete and I agree on, it's-it's Lucas.
that's it, just lucas?
well, look, if you're asking me if it's over, I don't know.
I - back when we were together, you know, Pete was ass.
and now that we're apart, he's...He's actually more of an ass.
you know, he-no, he- He refuses to let me be happy with anybody else.
okay, but seeing you with Scott - That has gotta be weird for him.
what are you doing? - What do you mean?
you're defending him. - No, I get where he's coming from.
he's coming from a place where he wants me to be miserable.
no. He is hurt. - He is the one who wanted to see other people.
I hated the idea. I cried.
and then I thought about it logically, and I thought, you know what? Pete's right.
he wants to be happy, I want to be happy, and neither of us should interfere with that.
aren't you interfering with his happiness by being in a relationship with somebody he works with?
Oh, the thing with Scott, it's not a relationship. It-it's-it's sex.
it's exactly the same thing that he's doing.
the-the only difference is that it's someone he-he- He-he sort of knows and sometimes sees.
but, cooper...It's not going anywhere.
well, maybe you should tell Pete that.
how long are you gonna keep Mason in the dark?
well, you saw how he reacted when he thought I...I can't tell him.
with all due respect, last night, Mason dumped the dinner I made him on the floor, ran out the door, and scared the hell out of me because he is worried about you.
now he's smart and he needs some answers.
and this is only gonna get worse.
if you don't tell him bef - He's never gonna forgive you.
and he'll hate me and Cooper, the only people he'll have left.
Erica, I know why you're lying to him.
but you're lying to him.
it's too much.
I can't tell him. Not yet.
Oh, I just can't.
I told you Eli was a fighter. - So's his mother.
what is it with you and Melissa?
I mean, it's like, from the very get go, you've just been on her side.
violet abandoned lucas. - Is that really what's bothering you?
it was a big deal, Cooper, and this has nothing to do with who Violet is sleeping with.
look, when she walked out, it was just me and lucas.
and he couldn't talk yet, but his eyes said it all.
Where's mommy? You're not my mommy.
when Violet came back, I was so angry at her, but she did come back, and I gave her another chance.
and whatever I think about her, she is an incredible mother.
Lucas would be much worse off without her.
Dr. Freedman.
I had to call.
I've spoken with Melissa and denise. I'm aware of the situation.
there is no situation. - Unless melissa starts using again.
there's no way to know if that will happen.
but Melissa did make a choice to get clean for her child.
Dr. Freedman, we've been through this together a lot of times, and you know we like to keep a child with its mother if at all possible.
but if your instincts say that it's to Eli's detriment, then we can explore other options.
Yeah.
I need to talk to you. - Just a minute.
no, I need to talk to you now.
Shainie, can I give you a call back?
Yeah, thanks. What's so important?
I have a lead on a way to treat erica's gliosarcoma. I have a lead.
well, if it involves getting on a plane to New Zealand, erica already said she didn't want to do that.
this one involves getting on a plane to Seattle.
I think my brother derek can help us.
people can do awful things, but they can also change.
you don't know my mother.
no, I don't. But I do know that being a parent is hard.
and it is easy to make mistakes, even when you're trying to do the right thing.
is that why you're giving her Eli, because you think it's been hard for her?
I think it's been hard for your mom. I think it's been hard for you.
and it's-it's sad.
but hopefully, it can be a reminder to both of you...
that with Eli, it has to be different.
he's gonna need a lot of care while he's recovering.
your mom's gonna need help...Being a mom.
I...I know it must not seem fair to you, but you are a family.
and you have to look out for one another.
Lucas wanted to know if his truck could fly, and, uh, it can't, so I got him a new one.
I thought he could leave it at your house. No stairs.
you know it's just sex. With Scott, it's just - It's just sex. It's a distraction.
I'm sorry, Violet. I'm just...
not evolved enough to want to hear about your sex life.
no, I wasn't gonna give you details.
I just wanted you to know that it wasn't serious.
okay. I just - I still don't like it.
well, you're the one that walked away, so you shouldn't care.
I know I shouldn't care, but I do.
you do? - Yeah.
well, maybe that means - You don't have to interpret my feelings, Violet.
I just...
I care.
is he really gonna be okay?
I resected the damaged part of Eli's lung.
in time, healthy tissue will grow in its place.
thank you.
you can do this, Melissa.
I know. It's all about Eli now.
maybe not all.
I- I thought that you - Bailed?
Yeah.
I- I'm s- - I know, mom. I know.
I'm sorry.
then do better with Eli. Okay?
you better.
how's it going with your sister?
pretty much the same.
it'll take a while for the meds to wear off.
you took her off everything?
no. No, I kept her on a mild sedative, because, uh, we don't know what to expect when...
we just don't know anything yet.
keep me updated, okay? - Thanks.
you, uh, you keep her at your house?
no, no, she's in my office...Staring at the walls.
that's hard.
Yeah, it's...Hard.
okay. Shoulda seen that coming. Didn't. Should've.
when you're, uh, when you're ready to meet more surrogates, you let me know.
I know it's complicated, and it's scary, and we can't promise you that this will work.
but one thing I can promise is that this gives you a little hope.
isn't that what you said about chemo?
what we said about chemo was that it would buy you some time.
but this surgery, it has the potential to be more than just a treatment.
we're not talking about buying you time anymore.
we're talking about curing you.
I know you don't want to tell Mason that, at some point, this tumor will kill you.
if you're open to this, you may not have to.
you hungry?
it reminds me.
you remember that house we used to go to in the summers?
it was in north carolina...
right on the beach.
uh, yeah, I remember.
your house reminds me of that.
I pushed myself to the limit that semester.
maybe even past the limit.
I was stressed. Didn't sleep.
got an incomplete in that tennis class. Had to take it over.
and in retrospect?
I loved every minute of it.
I was thinking how I keep waiting for life to get easier.
you know, lower stakes, less risk, more reward - Easier.
and I was thinking that maybe... It doesn't.
I was thinking that maybe the struggle, the climb, the one obstacle after another
maybe... That's just life.
done.
88 seconds.
can I call Cooper now?
you can call Cooper now.
nights when Lucas stays with Pete used to mean a long, hot uninterrupted bath, but this is so much better. Yeah?
Oh, well. I'm gonna take a half day tomorrow.
Oh, yay! I'm gonna come home for lunch. I'll see you then.
actually, I was thinking, maybe you'd bring lucas to the fire station.
that'd be the coolest place he's ever been.
that's really sweet.
that was really dismissive.
that's not - That's not how I meant it.
no? How-no, how did- How did you mean it?
look, you make me happy, Violet.
and I'm ready for this to be more. I want you to... meet my friends.
I want to get to know your son. I want your toothbrush in my bathroom.
I'm ready for it to be real.
is that what you want?
is it Pete?
I- Scott, I-I-I- I like you. I like this.
but... my life is- It's-it's complicated.
everyone's life is complicated.
the question is, do you want me to be a part of yours?
how are you feeling now?
good. Really good. And I'm so grateful.
I was a zombie, and you woke me up.
well, the wrong medication can make everything worse, but now that the fog has lifted, we can work toward a proper diagnosis.
well, today, right now, I - I feel normal.
I got up at 6: 00, I did a load of sam's laundry, I alphabetized his bookshelves.
I don't know about you, but I - I hate when people's books are just randomly stuffed in there, and you're looking for one, you can't find it.
then-then I-I went for a run, and I looked at the ocean.
and I-and I didn't- I didn't just stare at it. I really- I really saw it.
well, that's a lot for a morning.
Yeah. I-I have 20 years to make up for, for myself and for my brother.
I want us to be closer, but... I don't-I don't know how to.
you can always talk to me, Corinne, always.
I'm just not sure where to start and what to leave out.
there's a lot that I am not proud of.
well, that was your past, and perhaps, as we get more comfortable, we can address that.
why don't we focus on what's happening now?
I'm-I'm ready to start over, to have the kind of life that everyone else has.
well, that's something to work toward.
Oh, that... That sounds oddly patronizing.
wait, wait. You're saying, you don't think that she can get there or...
it's important to understand our limitations.
and that goes for all of us.
you're not listening. I'm not crazy.
this is me. I'm-i'm back now.
and-and there's nothing I can't do.
as Amy has told you, gliosarcomas are very aggressive tumors that don't respond well to treatment.
then what's the plan?
we're going to insert vascular balloons into your brain and bypass the large blood vessel that's infiltrated by the tumor.
our hope is to preserve the healthy brain tissue and remove the tumor.
what's the catch?
we only have 90 seconds to do it.
what?
after 90 seconds with no blood, Erica's brain tissue starts to die.
we'd be causing a stroke.
90 seconds? Can you do that?
not alone. But working together
they've done it in the practice suite twice.
twice.
twice so far. And we'll keep practicing.
Erica, I'm not gonna lie to you. This has never been done.
it's risky. But I believe we can do it.
maybe you want to take a few more days to practice, try and get that number up?
well, unfortunately, time is critical.
we have to remove the tumor before it gets too big.
when? - Today.
I'm s-you want to try a surgery on me that's never been successful today?
and if you fail, my brain dies. That's what we're saying.
you have two world-class surgeons telling you you have a chance.
two days ago, you had none.
you have to take that chance.
I need a day.
I have a son who's stuck watching tv with a nurse with no idea what's happening, so...
I need a day.
okay.
book the o. r.first thing tomorrow.
on my count. One...
Dr. Bennett, we were just watching tv, and then all of a sudden, Gloria couldn't catch her breath.
sudden onset of dyspnea.
no associated chest pain or palpitations. Tachy at 120.
cardiac panel, enzymes, portable chest.
she's also 30 weeks pregnant.
what? She's pregnant?
she didn't want to tell you.
that's because you knew it wasn't supposed to happen.
I'm so sorry.
High-flow o-2, 100%. - Dr. Bennett, what's going on?
she's in congestive heart failure. What are you doing here?
I'm the murphys' i. v.f doctor.
Dr. Reilly gave us our baby.
wait. What were you thinking?
you know how dangerous it is for her to carry a baby right now.
it was routine. There were no contraindications.
well, I gave her a donor heart.
I started working with her before I joined the practice. She never mentioned anything.
all right, well, don't you do physical examinations on your patients before you knock 'em up?
I did a gynecological exam. Gloria's was normal.
she - Look, I expect my patients to be forthright with their health. All right? She wasn't.
fine, you can rely on whatever
am I interrupting?
Yes. - No.
Jake did i. v.f. On one of my heart transplant patients.
not knowingly. - Well, that is either crazy or irresponsible.
could you please back me up on this? - I'm just-I just came in to get a yogurt.
Oh, no, no. - Addie
weigh in on this. I helped out a patient who lied to me that she had no preexisting conditions.
that's after he just happened to miss the zipper scar right down the middle of her chest.
I don't ask my patients to disrobe entirely when I'm doing a routine fertility evaluation. Do you?
okay, okay, well - Well, maybe you should.
you know, it doesn't matter how we got here.
what matters is keeping your patient alive and giving the baby a fighting chance.
she's almost 30 weeks. That's viable. If we deliver now
come on, we all know that there's a big difference between viable and healthy.
we can't wait. - We need to give this baby a chance.
Gloria could die. She's persistently hypotensive. She could be rejecting the donor heart.
there's a chance it could be something else.
that is a chance that I don't think we should take.
Sam's right.
you gonna eat that or frame it?
it's a little thing called attention to detail, my friend.
Oh, Violet, hello. - hey.
Hi. - Hello.
I'm sorry. I ju-I just need to get that juice.
I'm in a rush.
all right. See ya.
that wasn't awkward at all.
you got it.
come on, dad. Charlotte throws harder than you.
come on. Less chatty, more throwy.
you know what? I think it's gonna rain again. I think we should go.
we're not scared of a little rain, are we?
it's more the threat of pneumonia and lightning.
Mase, I think you right be right. Your dad might be a wuss.
go long.
mom! Did you see that?
you all right?
mom, what's wrong? Are you okay?
I'm not okay, honey.
I'm sick, and I'm sure you've noticed that.
and I should've talked to you about it before because... I'm really sick.
what do you mean? What's wrong with you?
there's a tumor in her brain, Mason.
mom... you're not gonna die, are you?
I hope not. I really, really hope not.
how long have you been sick?
a long time.
why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me you might die?
Mason... Mason, we're doing everything that we can, okay?
she should've told me!
Mason. - Here, I'll go. I'll go.
what were you doing before? - What do you mean?
with Corinne. I thought you were being patronizing and a little pessimistic.
no, sam, I was being realistic. Corinne's behavior felt.
her speech was pressured, she was highly energized, and her thoughts were expansive.
that's Corinne. - That's also hypomania.
all right. So... So she's a bit manic, which could easily precede full-blown mania and, uh... That's a freight train.
well, at least she's not depressed.
if my gut is right, that'll happen later.
well, then what are you saying?
I'm not prepared to confirm a diagnosis, Sam.
but it's very clear to me that Corinne is sick, probably since she was a teenager.
and the last two decades have been a spiral of descent.
well, I didn't hear her say that.
I'm trained to listen to what isn't said.
my sister being happy isn't a disease, sheldon. It...
look, when Corinne left, even when it was bad, she was my blood.
she was a huge part of my life.
and when she walked out that door...
a part of me died, and-and I buried it along with-with all my memories of her.
but now... I don't know. I- I-I think that-that she is back.
my sister is back.
well, Dr. Bennett thinks you should have a c-section now.
no. - It'll put the least amount of strain on your heart.
no. It's too soon for the baby.
do you really think delivering at 30 weeks is ideal?
look, you're not wrong.
it will put your baby at risk for developmental problems.
but waiting might not be an option.
we've been through so much.
to... To give up now and just hope that our premature baby survives...
we were wrong to deceive you, but no matter what Dr. Bennett says, we won't do a c-section.
not now.
Thanks.
okay, so remember I was telling you about that sex I was having, that unattached, x-rated, filthy hot sex?
Yes, I remember.
I think I may have screwed it up.
Scott said he wants more.
what did you say? - Nothing.
and what did he say?
I just rolled on top of him and shut him up.
interesting strategy.
I just... I don't know what I want.
Yeah, join the club. I slept with Sam.
what?
I was all jazzed up about saving that baby, and he was all spun out about Corinne.
one thing led to another. - Are you guys getting back together?
no. Because you wanna throw yourself at jake again?
Oh, no, definitely not. All I get from that guy is frostbite.
what about, uh, you know, what about you and Pete?
when I think about going back into that situation, I,you know, he hasn't changed. Nothing's changed, so, no.
and as for Scott, look, look, I am a mother, I have a full-time job.
I have no business getting into a real relationship with anybody.
okay, but do you like him? I mean, apart from the filthy hot sex?
he's good. He's kind.
he rubs my feet when we watch tv.
okay, there's nothing wrong with having fun.
if that's what feels right for you, then don't change a thing.
chocolate malted, and a coffee, too, please, regular.
thank you. Keep the change.
it's mom's favorite.
she's all right, you know? Mom.
I was afraid to ask.
it's been so long, I thought maybe she - No, no, no, she's fine. She's healthy, retired.
she's got a companion... Named james.
our mother is getting - No. no, no, no. no.
they just-they go out to dinners, he fixes stuff around the house.
sure he does.
come on. That's nasty.
did she ever talk... about me?
Yeah, yeah, uh, in the beginning.
but, you know, then it got tough for her.
more than she could, uh, take.
after a while - She forget about me.
no, you were always there. For both of us.
we should call her.
I can't. Not yet.
I... You know, this has - This has already been a lot. You know, I'm not ready. Okay?
okay. All right.
Oh, no. no, no. - Please!
I still haven't gotten over the p. t.s. d. from the last time you boned me.
no, it's been forever! - No. I'm a grown
let it go. Come on. Come with me right now.
you're going. - Okay.
done.
92 seconds. - Damn it. Son of a bitch.
well, you did it five times straight in under 90.
we don't practice until you can do it right, Dr. Grey.
you practice until you can't do it wrong.
okay. Go again.
how's erica?
sleeping. Or trying to.
I don't know how you fall asleep the night before you...
I did this wrong. I just-I did it all wrong.
how so?
dragging erica up here for some hail-mary surgery that our friends are gonna perform, they don't even know if they can pull off, and I can't help.
all I can do is pace around, thinking through every awful eventuality, and my son is trapped in a front-row seat for whatever happens.
and you, you didn't ask for any of it.
and you're trapped in the middle of a horror show you can't make any better.
Cooper, breathe. - No, I can't breathe, Charlotte. That's...
I can't breathe because I feel like I screwed...
everything up in the worst possible way.
you didn't screw it up.
you did the best you could.
tell me it's gonna be okay.
Cooper - I'm not asking for a fairy tale.
I'm just saying, no matter what happens, it's gonna be okay.
like, worst case and she dies, I mean, it's gonna be okay.
like, we can do this, we can raise this kid, you can be a mother.
say it's gonna be okay.
okay. It's gonna be okay.
so they're gonna be coming to take you to the o. r. In a couple of minutes, and, uh... How you feeling?
okay. But they keep it a little cold in here.
don't you think, baby?
Mason, please don't be mad at your mom right now.
no, he gets to be mad.
Mason, look at me. You get to be mad.
you get to have all of your feelings, as long as you know.
you have to know - That I love you.
come here.
I love you more than anything in this whole stupid world.
and I always will, from wherever I am, even if you're mad at me.
you know that, don't you?
now I need you to go with your dad.
and I have to talk to Charlotte for a second. Okay?
you can eat as much junk food as you want today.
what can I do for you?
teach him how to drive a stick, before you ever let him drive an automatic, teach him how to drive a stick so then he'll never be stranded, okay?
okay.
and don't push him too hard on his grades.
he's smart like Cooper, but... He's too hard on himself.
so don't add to that, okay?
okay. And talk about me.
you'll be his mom, but - no. You will always be his mama...
I - Whatever happens. Always.
he needs a living mom. He'll need you. You get that?
Cooper's not enough. He'll need you.
they're doing the surgery today?
okay. Well, yeah. Call or text or do something as soon as you know anything, okay?
all right. Love to everyone.
that was fast. How are Charlotte and Cooper holding up?
they're trying.
Oh, hey, do you have, uh, plans tonight?
do I have plans tonight?
Yeah. I was wondering if I could come by and see lucas.
if you're busy, then I'll - No, no, no, that's fine. That's fine. Uh, yes.
do you have a second?
I'm, uh, kind of busy right now.
I'm sorry that I didn't back you up with sam.
well, no surprise there, right?
look, you know what?
and I am quite capable of separating my personal feelings from my professional opinion.
look, Gloria fought the odds to become a mother.
you know, maybe unwisely, but she's earned the right to put the life of her baby ahead of her own.
no matter what we think, she has that right.
but Sam said
Sam isn't her i. v.f. Specialist. All right? And neither are you.
anything else?
you can do this.
there's no margin for error.
there's no margin for self-doubt.
you think I don't know that?
I, uh, I'll see you in the o. r.
the last time I operated on a friend, I was out of it.
it's a miracle nothing went wrong.
I mean, what if my karmic payback is now and Erica dies?
Oh, you're scared. That's good.
well, how is that different from having self-doubt?
well, you don't doubt your skills as a surgeon.
I wouldn't let you scrub in if you did.
well, I don't - I don't see the difference.
after dad died, any time there was a loud noise, like a gunshot, you'd jump out of your skin.
you got ahold of these firecrackers.
I found you in the yard, and you were setting 'em off one at a time, until you didn't jump anymore.
when you're scared, you fight.
you face your fear, and you fight. And you fight to win.
your fight is much stronger than any karmic payback.
you got this, Amy.
we got this.
I thought we'd have stir fry tonight.
this is adventurous.
when did you learn how to cook?
couple years ago.
it was this dive on pico and Venice.
the chef took pity on me.
let me watch in the kitchen and eat the leftovers.
wait. A couple of years ago? That... You must mean wait.
how... How long you been here in l. a?
it's, um... It's complicated.
Corinne? How long you been here?
there's a shelter on Santa Monica. I'm just
wait, wait, wait. Don't-don't-don't- Don't avoid me. Don't run away.
just answer my question.
Fi-five-five years.
do you have any idea what it's been like for me, for mom?
we... We thought you were dead. You-you get that?
we thought you were dead.
after ten years, we had a funeral for you.
You-you-your name was on a headstone.
Sam, I - Don't. Stop.
cause I had to watch our mother broken. She was destroyed.
and me... How could you do that to me, to us?
it's not about you. - How could it be?
it's always been about you.
what happened to my baby sister?
you don't wanna know.
you're right. I don't wanna know.
all this was so much easier when we thought you were dead.
last night, I was... Laying down in Sam's guest room, and I was fantasizing about an earthquake.
not one that would hurt anyone else.
just enough to make the piece of roof above my head fall and crack my skull open.
to what end?
I'm not sure.
I don't know if I just wanted the pain to stop or...
if I wished I could finally feel something real.
and then again, I don't - I don't even know what's real.
all of it is, everything you feel.
so I am a waste of skin. - Corinne.
what I did to Sam, to my mother, I should be taken out back and shot.
this is not your fault. You're suffering from a disorder. It's called
it doesn't matter what it's called because whatever you think it is, there's a drug for it, and I'm pretty sure I've taken it before, and it didn't work.
what's happening with you, what's been happening all these years, is bigger than you, and every day, a battle is fought in your mind.
and with repeated misdiagnoses and a lack of proper treatment and the instability of your life, all those things have made it worse.
you're suffering from... Bipolar disorder.
and right now, you feel like you can't go on, but I'm telling you I'm tired, Dr. Wallace. I'm so tired.
why'd this happen to me? I was so smart.
I got a's in everything. I could do everything.
my junior year in high school, everyone wanted to be me.
and then one day, it was all gone.
I can only imagine how hard that would be.
but the Corinne of yesterday...
did a load of laundry and organized some books and went on a run.
and if you can endure the bottoms, there will be tops that will allow you to shine and to thrive.
and with the proper medications and diet and sleep, we can try to turn down the intensity of the swings and help you achieve your own normalcy.
but you have to be patient and you have to let me help you.
the graft is ready ready to inflate.
timer on. 90 seconds.
ready? - Ready.
one, two, three. Go.
done. - It's in.
85 seconds!
sorry. 85 seconds.
new record. You did it.
we did it.
okay. Good. Moving on.
let's excise the infiltrated vessels.
pressure's gone through the roof. What's going on?
the artery's non-pulsatile. She's thrown a clot.
damn it. She's stroking out.
you know what that is?
it's a brain. - It's your mama's brain.
and that is the tumor growing inside it.
so the doctors have to cut into her head to get it out?
so how are they gonna do it?
well, first they'll cut out a section of her skull and dissect the brain so that they can see the tumor.
then they'll separate the tumor from surrounding tissue before removing it.
if everything turns out right, they'll close her up.
but... What could go wrong?
there are risks with any brain surgery.
your mom could get a blood clot or bleeding in the brain.
it might affect her speech, her vision, her memory.
she might have a seizure or a stroke.
or she could die from the operation.
but that is why we came to seattle.
we wanted your mama to have the very best surgeons doing her operation.
you're telling me the truth?
this is all of it?
Yes. This is all of it.
thank you.
you're welcome.
pressure's 179 over 105.
shut the hell up. We know.
the clot's jammed up against the proximal end of the shunt.
I see it. I'm taking the shunt out.
without the shunt, there's no blood supply.
well, if we don't clear the clot, she's dead. Do it.
Microscissors. Through the suture line.
almost there.
got it.
pressure is... Is what it is.
shunt's out... now.
I think that pretty much cleared out the clot.
good. Reinserting the shunt.
there.
artery is pulsatile.
and pressure's coming down.
okay. Shall we continue?
I need the graft and another microdriver.
just another five or six hours to go.
we're cruising now.
that scared the crap out of me. - Yeah, me, too.
Hey, uh... Can I talk to you for a minute?
look, I just wanted to apologize for, uh, for this morning.
I - I didn't mean to yell.
Yes, you did, because you are the selfish one.
for the last 20 years, everything in my head, it's - It's been big and bold.
no-no whispers, just screams and... And I tried to deal with it.
you know, I- I-I felt responsible. I thought it was me.
but you know what, Sam? I'm sick.
I'm the one with bipolar disorder.
so you can complain all you want about how worried you were and how worried mom was.
and I feel bad about that. I - I really do.
but I was living it. And I protected you from the worst of it.
while you were in med school, I did my first stint in jail.
and while you were off being a big fancy doctor, I was eating garbage so I could have enough money for drugs, because that was the only way to escape the pain.
and while you were having a family and living in Malibu, I was selling my body just to survive.
so... You missed me.
poor you.
this isn't your journey.
it's mine. It is my... Pathetic life.
and you might hate me, but guess what, Sam.
I hate me more.
and I could tell you to go to hell...
but having lived there the past 20 years, i'm pretty sure you can't handle it.
you know, so-so screw you.
what happened?
she was fine, and then she just started gasping for air again.
pulse ox is dropping. - Up the nitro drip.
back on 100% o-2. - Why is she not getting better?
I'm not sure. Listen, we're gonna have to take you to the cardio lab, all right?
we need to do an endocardial biopsy. We have to figure out what's going on with your heart.
is that procedure safe for the baby?
the baby will be exposed to radiation during the x-ray.
the procedure could cause precipitous labor.
no. I'm not doing it.
Gloria, listen to me. - She said no, Sam.
she can't breathe. She'll die if we don't do something.
then do something else. Give her another dose of diuretics.
she's maxed out. - Then put her on a pump.
Jake, she is a year and a half post transplant. She's been doing fine.
I'm not just gonna throw darts at a board.
I have to figure out why she's rejecting her heart right now.
I know.
I'm sorry...
but I stopped taking my immunosuppressant drugs when I got pregnant.
why would you do that?
they could hurt the baby.
you shouldn't have done that. You shouldn't have done that on your own.
her water broke. We gotta get her in to labor and delivery now.
watch your back there.
the baby's coming too fast. Gloria, I need you to stop pushing.
try to slow your breathing.
it-it hurts.
Gloria, look, breathe with me. Breathe with me.
come on. Pressure's dropping. Hurry up, Addison.
what's going on? - I'm starting to lose her pulse.
get ready to bag her. - I'm on it.
all right. Get that baby out of there, Addison.
head's out. - Anesthesia.
thoracotomy tray.
you're gonna crack open her chest? - I have no choice.
towel and cord clamp. - What do you need?
external saw.
it's coming.
all right. Spreader.
Addison, we're running out of time. - Got her.
scissors.
all right. I can crank her open.
do it.
damn it. - What's going on?
she's dissected her aorta. I need a cross-clamp.
call perfusion for bypass.
she's in fib.
we're losing her. - Almost there.
just give me a second.
Erica. It's Dr. Shepherd.
can you hear me?
hurts.
okay. We'll get you something for the pain.
can you wiggle your toes for me?
and your fingers? Both hands.
good. All right. We got the whole tumor. All of it.
I lived? I'm alive?
if this is heaven, sister, I want my money back.
I hurt.
the pain medicine's gonna kick in in just a second.
Erica, Mason's looking through the window.
no, don't raise your head.
just wave. You can do it. Lift your hand and wave.
perfect.
I'm alive.
we did that.
we did that.
we gotta publish. - Oh, hell, yeah, we do.
you ever think about doing drugs again - Remember this?
well, I was gonna say, call me. I'll fly down to los angeles and knock some sense into you.
but okay. Remember this. If that doesn't work...
Yeah, you can totally kick my ass.
done.
I love you.
she's so small, but she's perfect.
got ten little fingers and ten little toes.
and her face looks... Just like you did when you were younger.
it's not a boy, though, so I guess we can't use the name Thomas.
we never really talked about girls names.
we shoulda talked about girls names.
she's gonna need something strong, like her mom.
we shoulda talked about girls names.
we shoulda.
what are you thinking about?
nothing.
come on.
well, I actually was thinking about how bizarre my life is.
I live in a hotel.
I... Uh... I'm having s-e-x with a 29 year old.
and I had I- n-t-e-r-c-o-u-r-s-e... in an elevator.
I know you did, with an s-l-u-t.
these bars and these women, it's not - They're not...
you ever think a year ago that we'd be talking about having sex with other people?
no.
who are we?
I don't know.
I love medicine!
seriously, I do. The whole medical field, I am in love with it.
I would marry it if I wasn't already married to you.
well, I am glad I got to you first.
thank you.
and thank you.
I mean, you did not sign up for this.
I love him.
Mason, I... I didn't think I could.
I mean, I didn't think I would, but...when I thought his mama might die...
I love him.
and I think it's... I think it's cause I love you so damn much.
I love you, Cooper, so damn much. - I love you.
I like you.
you make me feel... You have reminded me that I can, laugh and smile and be fun and not think about anything but being close to you.
and that is... So, so nice.
I don't want more. I don't have more.
so it's either incredible...
Unattached...
mind-numbing sex or, uh... Nothing.
I'll take it.
tell me something.
am I reading too much into...All of this?
into? - You and me.
the grocery store, Fiji, palm springs - Am I reading too much into that?
was it purely physical or...
is... Is there something emotional here?
for me?
Yeah. For you.
it's not just physical.
okay.
I figured...
I thought that you left because of me.
that time when I told mom that I didn't want a party for my birthday...
because I didn't want you to ruin it just like everything else.
I turned around, and you were standing there, and I know... That you heard me.
and a week later, you were gone.
I didn't leave because of you, Sam.
I left... because I was sick.
you didn't cause this. You didn't make this happen.
and you'd think that that would be a depressing thought- That there's no end to all of the， I don't know, that it doesn't get easier, that it just gets different.
but it's not. It is not.
it's the opposite of depressing. There's a relief in it.
life is complex. There's nothing simple or easy about it.
so I can stop waiting for it to... I can stop waiting.
and I can just... live.
I get his Mia. And the first time I met her, I remember she was telling me about this guy - Robert something.
and she described him as "more old-man good-looking than college good-looking.
and she said how it would be a waste to date somebody like that while still in college.
but he was crazy about her and he kept asking her out, and she kept saying no - Again and again. And then.
junior year, during finals, I was in the library, and I saw them together in the stacks making out.
I mean, like, seriously making out. And I kept thinking, how did that happen?
sorry, dad. Just one more minute.
it's your birthday, Ange. Take five more minutes.
so there's. Something I wanted to tell you.
let me guess. You're dropping bio and all of your pre-med classes?
I was planning on sneaking that in after dinner.
just kidding. I like being pre med. Kind of.
anyway. The thing is. I did it.
I had sex for the first time.- What? i- No, wait.
Don't-don't- Don't say that again.- I mean, - I might be in love so we had sex, and it was - Oh, no. No,
I- I don't- I don't really want to know what it was like.
I don't want to know anything about it. You're still 8 and you're putting on your mother's makeup for the first time.
I'm not 8, and he's really nice.
and his name is - I mean, you realize, you tell me his name, - I'm gonna have to hunt him down - dad.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I mean, this is a.
this is a little weird for me. You're.
you're my baby girl.
I know, but. I kind of
I don't know, I wanted to tell you because I'm so happy.
and I figured that is something you'd want to hear.
well, I do, but I.
I do, and I'm - I'm glad you told me.
it's nice, feeling like this.
Yeah, it-it is.
Oh, my god. Do you have someone?
let's go eat. Come on.
how long have I been sleeping?
since last night. - How do you feel?
groggy.
okay, I guess.
I'll be right outside if either of you needs me, okay?
Oh, god. Sam. Your head. - Don't worry about it. I'm fine. I'm fine.
no, no, no, I - I broke your door.
well, I was worried about you, and the door, it wasn't your fault.
no, even if I don't mean to do.
the stuff I do, I still- it still happens.- Stop it. S-Corinne. Stop. Stop.- I still do it.
stop it. Stop.
we are in this together. Okay?
now as long as you keep trying- No, I will. I promise. But just- I know. I know.
I promise.
please. Don't give up on me.
you know, because without you - Hey, I'm not going anywhere.
okay. Okay.
okay, look, I think she needs a proper facility.
all right. Well, I'm a doctor. All right? I can handle all that.
it's not a one-man job. Okay?
she's gonna require strict supervision around the clock, daily therapy, constant monitoring till we find a drug cocktail to keep her stabilized.
Sheldon, I can do all of that. - Sam, it can be a huge challenge to get someone in Corinne's conditionjust to take her meds.
you can't give up your entire life to do this, even if you tried - She's my sister!
then be her brother, not her warden.
you gotta trust me on this.
Dr. Wilder, we need you.
is that Scott? What the hell happened?
it was a domestic. Husband went crazy on his wife.
we thought he was gone.
trauma panel. C-spine, chest and pelvis.
he came back with some friends. They jumped us. Scott got the worst of it.
okay, on my count. - Honestly, I'm fine.
one, two, three. - Son of a bitch!
okay, his shoulder is dislocated. 5 of morphine, i.v. Push.
he took a few blows to the ribs and got kicked in the head.
call neuro. We need a brain c. t.
violet. - He's been asking for her.
should I. Should someone call dr. Turner?
I'll do it.
what are you doing here so late? - Catching up on patient files. you?
I checked on Corinne.
you're hovering. It's weirding me out.
so any.Any decision?
I think I want mint tea instead of chamomile.
Yeah, I meant, you know, the baby.
what baby?
I know this is hard, but you're well into your second trimester.
time is running out if you decide you want to.
I mean, you know, if - If you need to.
terminate.
you could keep the baby.
I'm two seconds sober. I'm not exactly mother of the year material.
what about adoption? - Because crack babies are in such high demand.
I'm sorry none of the choices are without pain.
it's time. You know, you.
you need to choose.
Oh, my. - Spinning, spinning, spinning.
Oh, right hand yellow.- Oh, okay. Oh, great.- Good thing I do yoga.
no, my body does not move that way.
mom, you should come play. - Oh, but your mom is the best spinner.
that's right. I am the best. Come on, Cooper. Right hand yellow.
that was just sad.- Could we play wii or something now?- Can we play wii or something.
okay. I will reign supreme.
spin it. - Spinning.
what happened?
he got himself between a battered wife and a drunk husband.
husband came out on top, though, so. - Don't say that. This isn't funny.
that's my shoulder. - It's dislocated.
can you do something? - I'm gonna try to reduce it before the morphine wears off.
it's not gonna be very pretty.
I've seen worse things than a shoulder being slid back into its socket. Let-let me help.
okay. I'm gonna do the kocher maneuver. Do you remember how to do it?
of course.
okay. Come right in here.
put your hands on his shoulder.
when I say, you push down hard.
ready?
okay, now.
it's not working.- Push harder.- Pete, I can't. It's not working.
you're not pressing hard enough.- I need some help here.- Violet, we are almost there.
we can't stop now. Hey, violet. Hey, hey, look at me. Look at me, you can do this.
you gotta trust me. Now press down as hard as you can go.
okay.
you okay?- I'm fine. Thank you.- Yeah, that just, you know, wasn't.
you know, how I remembered it.
all right. Let me get a nurse to immobilize that.
thank you.
you know, you're gonna run out of questions to ask me about school.
and since we already covered Ethan, whose last name will remain unknown for security reasons.
sooner or later, we're gonna get around to you.
what do you want to know?
are you happy? Um, I'm headed there.
I- I like the practice. The people are great. Good, smart docs.- But?
well, I'm - I'm the new guy, right? I mean, I've been there for a while.
I'm starting to fit in, but I don't know, I'm kind of the old new guy now.
so who's the woman? I didn't, uh, I didn't say anything about a woman.
you didn't have to.
it's, uh. It's complicated.
but you like complicated.
you hung around with my mother.
who was a drug addict and had an 8-year-old daughter.
come on.
her name is Addison.
and she's beautiful and brilliant and frustrating.
you know when someone is, um, is confused, they
they-they start sending out mixed signals?
she's doing that? - I think I am.
you know, mom would want you to be happy.
she would.
what are you doing? - I want you to take me home.
Corinne, we're not there yet. - Will you take me home?
all right, look.
I want you to get better. - That won't happen in this place.
you took me out of jail, and it's like I'm a prisoner all over again.
you know, I'm afraid if I don't smile, they'll sedate me.
I'm not a person here, not human.
I don't want to do this anymore.
just. Please just get me outta here.
okay.
no, it's just a little early. You usually don't pop by. Is everything okay?
what are you doing with that?
Oh, garbage disposal broke.
and you're fixing it, huh? I would've thought that you had someone to - Come on.
I perform lifesaving surgeries on babies in the womb.
I can certainly fix my own sink.
and the handyman was backed up for three days, so.
okay. What's going on?
I went to the hospital this morning to visit Corinne, and Sam had checked her out.
I told him it was a mistake. - You don't think that Corinne can get better at home?
I don't know how much better she can get at all.
and even with the best meds, Corinne will struggle with chronic mental illness, and it's gonna be difficult just to.
just to keep her stable. Sam doesn't want to hear all that.
well, it's his sister, and we do have an obligation to family.
to that extent that we can help, but sometimes the help that families and Corinne went through a glass door.
what if it's fire next time? - You want me to talk to him?
and what would you say? - Well, you made a logical appeal. I would make an emotional appeal.
I think that makes sense.
okay.
do you know anything about sinks? - no.
that's gonna leave a scar?
well, I'm gonna do the best I can, but, uh. Yeah.
at least you'll have some bragging rights with the other paramedics.
just not with Violet. - How so?
I get the feeling she's not impressed. - Ah, she's just scared.
it's kinda like a. A mother scolding her kid for running out in the street without looking.
she's not really angry. She's just terrified something much worse coulda happened.
I'm gonna try not to read into that whole child analogy.
Hey, look, believe it or not, I'm happy for you and Violet.
I do find that hard to believe.
we've reached a place in our friendship, in our coparenting.
she's got you now, and I'm dating someone, so - What happened? - He passed out. B. p.
is 90 over 50.
his abdomen's rigid. He's bleeding into his belly.
cross and match times four. Get in touch with the o. r.
I'm gonna go with you. - No, you stay here.
I'll come get you and soon as I know what's going on.
what are you doing? - Uh, oh, Corinne's taking a bath, so. I just wanted to make sure she's okay.
I was just. Making sure that you're okay.
Oh, I'm fine.
yeah? And Corinne?
she's fine. She's fine. You know, it's - It's an adjustment.
but we're - We're figuring it out.
Corinne? - I'm still here, Sam.
I can't even imagine how.
painful this must be for you.
you could hire someone to help, find somewhere for her to stay where she can get the care she needs.
come on, Addison.
you know I'm not gonna do anything like that.
I know. That's why I'm worried.
I appreciate it. I really do.
I'm gonna be fine.
really.
this is Ryan's baby.
I can't abort Ryan's baby.
and. I can't give away Ryan's baby.
so you're having ryan's baby? - Yeah.
I'm having Ryan's baby.
how about that?
morning. - How are you?
what? - You really want to make a baby with me?
you're not ready.
I mean, I-I think she's still in shock.
she- who?- Oh, Violet. Scott was badly beaten on a run last night.
is he okay? - He's in surgery. Violet's at the hospital.
and it was Pete that was working on him. - Oh, that's awkward.
I should go see her.
what?
nothing.
Hey, Sam. Uh, how's corinne doing? - She's all right. Thanks.
Sam.- Yeah.- If you need anything- Thank you.
we're okay.
Mason, you are not supposed to use your cell phone from school.
are Sam and Corinne okay?
I tried.- I'm sure you did.- Well, is it time for another intervention?
wait. Slow down. I can't understand you.
too soon?
okay, just stay put. We will be right there. I love you.
it's Erica. There's something wrong.
Oh, it's - Oh, it hurts. What the hell is this?
Mase. - dad. It's okay. We're here. We're here.
what's going on? - She's complaining of crampy abdominal pain with distension.
well, that can't be secondary to neurosurgery, not in her abdomen.
Erica, any headaches, weakness? - No, no. My stomach.
I ordered an abdominal c. t.
Oh, I think I'm gonna.
is that blood? - Cooper, take him away.
I don't want to go.
we'll bring you back after the doctors help your mom, okay?
now come on, Mason. Come on.- I love you, mommy.- I love you.
how come you're not eating?
I'm not hungry. - Come on, Corinne.
I can't make myself hungry.
look. If we're gonna do this, there have to be rules, right?
you gotta get eight hours of sleep, you gotta eat properly, -take your meds. -Yeah, okay, okay.
thank you.
there you go.
open your mouth.
come on. Open up. I can't see. All right.
if I wanted to be humiliated, I could've stayed in the hospital.
Oh, come on, Corinne. I don't want to do that.
you know that's not what I'm doing, okay?
now eat your food.
look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right? I'm just trying to - It's not that.
well, then what is it?
I don't want to be here.
okay, well, you said you wanted to come back home, so - No, I don't mean here in your home.
I mean here on earth, alive.
and don't worry. I don't have the courage to kill myself.
it could be worse on the other side.
I'd probably just.
screw it up and become a quadriplegic or so
the worst place for me, the scariest place for me, is in my mind, and that's all I'd have left.
so I'm not gonna do it, but.
I don't want to be here.
okay.
I know it may seem like it, but you're not gonna feel this way forever.
okay?
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.
all right.
I just saw Pete.
Scott had a delayed rupture of his spleen due to the trauma, and they had to remove it.
is he gonna be okay? - He's doing fine.
uh, they're just finishing up now. They'll move him to recovery.
well, that's good. - Have you talked to Cooper?
no. Why? - Erica's in the e. r.
what happened? - She collapsed. Mason called Cooper. It's. It's bad.
okay. Well, where is he? I'll go see him.
Yeah, Cooper's with mason right now. I'd-i'd give it a little while.
okay.
are you gonna be okay?
well, my boyfriend or whatever who， who I care about was rushed into the e. r.
and was treated by my husband, who I also care about.
and he's trying to decide if our marriage is worth saving.
and now my best friend's son's mother is back in the hospital.
so. Not okay. - Not so much.
not so much.
you said my mom was okay.
I thought she was, and she still might be.
she threw up blood. - And that's not good, but Amelia and Pete and Charlotte, they're gonna figure it out.
are you lying to me? - no.
Mason, no, I promise. Hey, look at me.
I don't know what's going on with your mom.
but if she's sick again, you have to tell me this time. - I promise.
swear. - I swear.
I will tell you whatever I know.
just wanted to check and see if you were okay.
he's still sleeping.
I'm fine. How's Erica?
she's stable. Amelia's running some scans.
Where's Cooper? Is he still with mason?
Yeah. It's rough.
I just.
I keep thinking, if it was one of us.
I know. I called the nanny. I had her put Lucas on the phone twice already.
I know. I called earlier, but he'd already gone down for a nap.
Yeah, well, don't worry. Um, I told him that I was with you.
thank you.
how you feeling? - Awful.
sore. Thank you.
Oh, come on. No problem.
so, uh. I will catch up with you guys later.
it's a beautiful day out. Want to get some fresh air, go for a walk?
wait. Hold up.
no, I'll go alone. - No, I'll come with you.
Sam, I'll walk straight out to the beach. You'll be able to see me.
if I put rocks in my pockets and start to run into the ocean, you'll notice.
Sam. Were you-were you gonna go with your sister?
uh, no.
what are you doing? - She said she'd rather be dead.
so I don't know if she really feels like that or if it's some kind of cry for help - but I just feel like I need to- Suicide-proof the house?
Sam. You can't do this.
you cannot watch her every second. It's too much.
we've been through this.
I get wanting to do anything you can for your family. I get it.
you know, you're doing this because you feel a sense of - Of responsibility and guilt.
but I am telling you, no matter how hard you try, you won't bring Corinne up.
she'll bring you down.
and that makes me scared for you.
well. I made a promise to my sister that I'd never give up on her.
so. I won't.
can you just take these, please?
this is it, huh?
the glio has metastasized.
another tumor. - Not just one. It's in your liver, your g. i.Tract, and it's encroaching on your spinal column.
how long?
that depends on a number of factors - How long?
given the bleeding, maybe a week.
what do I have to look forward to?
paralysis in your legs.
your bowels will stop working. Constant pain.
he can't see this. - Erica, Mason will want to be around you as much as possible.
my son will not watch me become pathetic and useless.
he will not watch because that.
I love him too much to see that look on his face.
I can't do that to him.
do you understand? Do you understand?
what are you doing here?
well, that-that's a lovely greeting.
is everything okay? - Yeah, yeah, I just, uh.
is that a gun?
did you find out Ethan's last name and come here to defend my virtue?
look, about that, I'm.
I'm sorry if I was acting weird when you were telling me that thing you were telling me.
you're still acting weird.- I know. Look, I.I'm just-I'm.
it's gonna take me a minute to get used to the idea that you're a-a woman.
EW. Don't call me that.
well, what do you want me to call you? - Ange.
come walk me to my next class.
anyway, I'm feeling.
I don't know, a little out of my depth with all of this.
I'm trying to figure out the difference between thingsthat will help and things that will - make you cringe. - Oh, god. What's in the bag?
Seriously? Condoms?
just, you know. - Yeah, I know. Thanks.
so you think maybe one of these days I can meet this Ethan?
I'd like that. And maybe one of these days, I can meet addison.
we could double date.- Uh, yeah. I don't- I don't think so.
Why? What's happening with her? - Nothing's happening with her.
don't you want to be with her?
I'd rather have your mom back.
so do I, but in a world of things that actually could happen.
look, the point is, being in love or whatever, just feels completely amazing.
and I just feel, you should try it again.
I can say that. You just gave me condoms.
okay, it's time to take it.
I'll take it later.
no, you can't do that. - No, I haven't eaten.
all right. Well, I'll get you something to eat.
you know, I don't want to, Sam.
and these pills are not gonna help me.
uh, Corinne, we're not doing this. Okay?
the pills upset my stomach. - That's because you're not eating enough.
happy now?
you're gonna have to eat some more.
no.
well, then your stomach's gonna hurt. But you have to take your pill, Corinne.
I'm not taking the pill. - Look, look, this is not a negotiation.
why are you doing this? - Because we made a deal.
you said that you would try and - And you think I'm not trying?
I think that you're making this a lot harder than it needs- yeah, well, harder- harder for you?
I have to live like this.
you watch me, and you order me around, and you- And you judge-silently- But you judge.
I'm trying to take care of you. Now please take that pill.
no.- take this- no!- Take this damn pill. No. No.
take this pill.- No.- Take this pill!- no.-Take this pill!
open your mouth. Open your mouth! Open your mouth!
take your pills!
take your pills!
take your pills!
I did some
I don't know. It's like I became.
I can't make her better.
I don't know how much I can help her at all.
it's too much to expect of yourself.
I mean, I can't walk away.
if I give up, it'll hurt her so badly.
and, um.
I could lose her again.
maybe, but you love Corinne.
and if you really want to help her, that's a chance you have to take.
so she's gonna die? - Yeah. Soon.
can I go see her? - Of course. Yeah.
but here's the thing - Your mom is really, really sick.
and she's gonna get a lot sicker in the next week before she dies.
like throwing up blood? - Yeah. That and other stuff.
like what?
your mama will start to lose feeling in parts of her body.
so it'll get hard for her to walk and to hold things, go to the bathroom, and finally, to breathe.
that's a lot, I know, but your mama's tough.
the only thing in the world she really cares about is you, which is why she doesn't want you to watch her get worse.
she doesn't want you to see her when it's really bad.
she wants you to remember her strong and healthy and happy.
so tomorrow we're gonna take you to say good-bye to her.
I can't see her after tomorrow?
well, your mom.
she wants to protect you.
she must be so scared.
that looks - Disgusting. I know.
but it is the only thing I want to eat, and I can't do this in the kitchen because then everyone will know.
Yeah, well, forgive me for starting the obvious, but you live with Addison.
and she's gonna know you're pregnant soon enough.
I will get to it, sheldon.
your baby can't wait for you to get to it.
you need to start prenatal care now.
you need to start taking vitamins, you need an ultrasound.
please stop talking.
what happened to me?
I'm a professional psychiatrist, I have insight, reason, compassion in spades.
no one wants to listen to me anymore.
perhaps I should just remove my shingle.
I could settle down in some remote village somewhere. I - I have an ipad.
I could be a god. People would listen to me.
Sheldon, I'm listening, but you're not getting it.
we were doing drugs when this baby was conceived.
we were doing so many drugs that it killed Ryan.
what-what if my baby has two heads and a scaly tail because of me?
most likely, your baby is completely healthy. And it'll just need you to take care of it.
the point is, the minute I tell Addison - I mean, the minute I go to a doctor- Everything that I have done to myself and this baby
I. I mean, I can't avoid it anymore. It's real.
it's already real, Amelia, whether you want it to be or not.
I. Fine. Okay. I said I'd be here for you.
so should we get you some baggy clothes or leave the country?
I have a cousin in a convent in France. I mean, I'm sure they could take you in there?
well, maybe not you.
thank you, sheldon. - Don't.
so, uh, I didn't have time to stop anywhere this morning, and the gift shop in the, uh, hospital's sort of lacking.
but, um. Bawk.
I thought this could cheer you up.
I thought the bear kinda looks like you, don't you think?
no, maybe, uh, on the.
on the nightstand there.
uh, why don't you.
why don't you sit? Why don't you sit down?
I am so glad that you're here. It's, uh.
it means more to me than you can imagine.
but I know that it's.
it's probably more out of a, um.
a sense of responsibility.
That-that's- That's not true.
what we've had has been.
it's great.
and you are great, Violet.
but you and me, that's.
that's not what you want.
not really.
are you - You and Pete are a family.
and I don't want to get in the middle of that.
I don't-I don't know that I could even if I wanted to.
you're a family.
and you should be a family.
I'm glad you called.
so, uh. When you suggested an in-patient
there are people that will care for her around the clock.
she'll be kept safe, med compliant, she'll get therapy and whatever support she needs.
it'll be better for her, Sam.
I don't know if I'll be able to.
abandon her like that.
this is the best thing for her.
she's never gonna see it that way.
I'll be right outside.
come here, you.
you are my boy.
the best thing I ever did was make you, was have you.
and right now, you must be so confused and mad.
I'm not mad. - Good. Good. That's good.
I just wish.
I wish you didn't have to go.
me, too.
I am so proud of you. - It's okay.
I'm gonna listen to Cooper and Charlotte.
I'm gonna do my homework and brush my teeth.
I'm gonna behave in class.
I'm gonna read books instead of watch too much tv.
and I'll eat green beans.
I promise.
I love you, mom. - I love you, too, Mason.
Cooper. - Mase, let's, uh, let your mom rest now.
if you see nana, say hi, okay?
I will, baby.
I love you.
I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you.
I didn't cry. I didn't cry.
I was strong so she'd remember me smiling and being a good boy.
I didn't cry, Charlotte.
uh, Angela.
how could you tell?
because my colleagues don't usually play peekaboo.
what are you doing here?
I figured I should see this place in person. - Oh, you just came by to see my office?
is that her?
Addison. This is Angela. My-my daughter.
hi - Hello, Angela. It's so nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.- Really?- Yeah.
I'm sorry.
uh, I don't know who.
I was. I.
it's just hard.
this is, uh, a lot harder than I thought it would be.
and-and I know that it's impossible for you, but, uh, somehow I.
I made it about me, and- No, I was awful and-and I didn't listen.
just-just let me finish. Let me finish.
I don't ever, ever want to hurt you.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm terrified.
and I don't.
I don't know how to do this.
not the right way. - You're doing your best, and I'm-I'm the one who's been screwing up.
I talked to Dr. Wallace, and I think we may have- Have come up with- With a plan
a better plan - For moving forward.
are you giving up on me?
no. no, I will always be here for you
always be here for you- And I-I will come and visit you.
V - no, visit where?
no. No, no. No, Sam.- Just listen to me.- No. Don't.
listen, lis-listen.- Don't.- there is a place.- Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.
and they have - No, no, please.
I- Please, please.- I- I'll be better.
you know, I know-I know I wasn't-I wasn't good, but I-I can do it, Sam.
I can do it. You-you can't- Don't put me away.
no, I'm not putting you away. - You're all I have left. You can't.
you need help, and they can.- You can't.- You're- Take care of you.- No. No. No.
I'll-I'll sleep and-and I'll eat, and I'll take my pills, and-and-and I'll-i'll go for a walk every day.
Corinne- And-and-and-No, no, no, no. And I won't talk about the bad things.
I won't talk about the stars, and-and I won't do that. I won't do it. No, you can't.
You-please. No, please! You can't! You can't put me away!- I'm not.
you can't put me away! You can't! You can't- I'm not putting you away.- Stop.
you can't give up on me, Sam! - Stop saying that. I'm not. You can't give up on me, sam!
you can't! You can't!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. sorry.
I need to talk to you.
are you okay?
what's wrong?
I'm. I'm, uh.
I'm pregnant.
Oh, god. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I know how hard you've tried.
and I know that it is not fair - No, no, stop, stop. Just. Stop.
okay, Amelia, I am so happy for you.
you don't hate me?
hate you?
you're gonna make me an aunt.
Amelia, you're having a baby.
thank you.
okay, we're all set here.
all right, ms. Bennett, it's time to go.
Corinne, I'll be by to see you.
and I'll come visit you when-whenever you want. You know that.
Sam, I'm-i'm your sister.
I can do this.
I can. I can be the old corinne again. I - I can.
would you just take me home? And I'll show you. Okay?
you know that I love you, that I'm doing this because I love you.
you need to be safe.
I never shoulda called you.
that was unbearable.
I can't even imagine.
I'm not looking forward to the rest of my life.
is there someone you want me to call - An aunt or.
a cousin or a friend?
happy to make arrangements for anyone who - I don't have anyone.
now that's just not true.
so I'm looking at the college newsletter the other day, and there they are- Mia and robert something- In the announcements.
they're married for 20 years.
so what did that say to you?
I don't know. I mean.
you'd think that the lesson would be not to give up.
but.
how did this guy know when the yes was coming?
how does anyone know when to keep going and when to just let go?
I'm going to Santa Barbara.
to go see Miles?! Oh, my god!
I had this made for you.
every yellow letter is an answer on the test.
Megan, we need to talk.
I got a job. The shoot is in Brazil.
I gotta go get my keys and catch Rose
before she makes the biggest mistake of her life!
can I help you?
Hi, I'm Megan Smith. I'm Rose and Sage's tutor.
we met at the parent/teacher barbecue.
we discussed our mutual love of corn.
we're about to begin our final exam.
I know. I know. I know. It's just that, um, I borrowed Rose's purse last night.
and I left my cell phone and my wallet in there.
so, I don't mean to interrupt, but can I go grab it?
thank you.
hurry, please. - Ok.
I will just give this back to you when you get home.
good luck.
you're still here?
I- I could leave if you're filled with rage and all.
Oh, I'm ragey! But not at you.
obviously I'm happy for you.
brazil. Whoo! That's fun.
you want to just take a beat?
I want to beat Rose with this purse.
this cheating purse. She made a cheating purse!
she put the answer key on the back?
that's kind of genius. - It is, isn't it?!
yet you would think this level of genius would be applied to
I don't know-Studying!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm fine.
just
let's talk.
so, Brazil.
wait. Hold on. Let's not use the serious talk voice yet.
tell me all the good stuff so I can be happy for you.
I mean, this is a huge deal, right?
Yeah.
it's the first time I'll be the actual photographer instead of somebody's assistant.
it's amazing. - Right?
I'll be shooting this kid Gilberto Silva.
he plays for the Brazilian national team.
and they tell me that if the season goes well,
I could be gone for 6 months.
you know what?
probably not as bad as it sounds right now.
I mean, we could figure something out.
we could always just take a pause.
take a what?
I'm sorry, what did you say?
uh, what do you mean by "a pause"?
not that we have to.
I- I just didn't know what a long distance thing would be like at this point.
no. You're right.
I mean, it was less than 12 hours ago that we became official.
so it's probably a little premature.
I don't leave for 2 days.
so... we don't have to decide all this right now.
OK. I mean...
I'll call you later.
great.
I should be banned from dating.
Why? What'd you do now?
it's too humiliating to tell.
so, what's up with you?
I need a favor. You remember my cousin Luis?
he just graduated from high school and he wants to be a chef.
but he needs some actual experience before he applies to culinary school.
so, I was wondering if you could ask Marco if he needs an extra hand around there.
well, sure. No guarantees but i'll ask.
Hey, Charlie, what do you think of long distance relationships?
I think they're pointless.
well, tell me how you really feel.
I mean the whole point of being in a relationship is to be with the other person.
fine.
I'll call you back when I have a better counter-argument.
can't wait.
I just got off the phone with Bob the landlord.
it's done. I'm officially out of the rat hole.
excellent.
you need help renting a truck or anything?
Uh-uh. I was just gonna bribe a few friends with pizza and some beers.
but you know, I've been thinking about your bed.
Oh, that's my girl! Cuts right to the chase!
I mean, I was thinking that now we have 2 beds.
and we do need to make room for my antique rolltop desk.
it was my grandma's.
and I don't want to piss grandma off.
so, uh, how much stuff do you have?
um, I don't know.
the bed, a couple bookcases, a dresser, 2 nightstands,
a few standing lamps, plus the fridge.
Wow. - Well, yeah.
you've seen my place.
look, we don't have to do this.
maybe we jumped the gun here.
don't stress out. It's cool.
I'll just see what's out there.
although it kinda sucks I only have 2 weeks.
no. I didn't say you have to look.
all right, well...
I'm on my way to work.
we can talk more about this later or something. Ok?
sage, you can leave.
I need to scream at your sister in private.
OK. Maybe we can talk this out.
I appreciate everything you've already done.
but I will handle this.
what has she already done?
you can thank your sister for saving your ass today.
she clued me in on what you were about to do.
you told her?!
I didn't. I promise.
sage, leave. I'm serious.
OK. Look, I know this looks really bad.
there is nothing to explain.
you cheated.
you lied to me, and you cheated. So you're grounded.
indefinitely. I mean, we're talking the x-Games of grounding.
without the games.
so after your little French final tomorrow,
you're confined to these 4- Make that 6 to 8 walls.
no phone. No internet. No pilates.
consider your new status grounded to infinity.
I hate my life. I hate my life.
you've reached Laurel Limoges.
please leave a message.
uh, Laurel, it's, uh, it's me, Megan.
I just had to ground Rose.
and I wanted to fill you in on everything.
I know you're probably with Miles right now.
but just give me a call when you can. Ok?
Hi.
can I help you?
it's me, Miles.
it's Laurel.
hello.
Yes, Mr. Solano, I'm so glad you so glad you called.
I'm getting ready for the trip, but I do still have a few questions.
can you just hang on a second while I go grab my notebook?
Oh, really?
no, I didn't know.
I see.
sure. I-I understand.
an old girlfriend of mine in New York was telling me about this legal situation she was in.
Heh. And I found myself recommending your firm without even thinking.
I didn't have that firm for about 3 years.
I turned it over to my daughter Elise,
who bullied me into an early retirement.
it suits you.
Oh, does it?
there's that laugh.
you haven't changed.
Oh, you're sweet.
terrible liar. But i'll take it.
Yeah. Well-Ooh! - Ohh! Heh heh. Oh lord.
talk about somebody who hasn't changed,
you still can't make a cup of coffee can you?
?? I'm spoiled.
Jessica would never let me into the kitchen.
and now you know why.
Oh, gosh.
she died about a year ago.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, thanks.
I was sorry to hear about Robert's passing.
I wanted to call you at the time,
but I wasn't sure it was the right thing to do.
we made a few mistakes, you and I.
there were so many things that I never shared with anyone,
not even you.
what didn't you tell me?
the reason that I left the firm so abruptly.
it wasn't because I was angry with you.
it was because I was pregnant.
and the baby was yours.
I mean, the whole thing is such crap!
they never even told me that they offered it to someone else before me.
I only got the job because he turned it down.
they completely should have told you.
right?! And now that his schedule opened up and he's suddenly free,
they were more than happy to screw me over just to get him back.
completely sucks.
but you know what? Look on the brightside.
you were their second choice.
out of who knows how many people, you were number 2.
I know I sound like such a jackass right now.
I just...
I just really wanted this thing.
it's ok.
I think things like this happen for a reason.
like, what kind of reason?
well, I mean, you know,
another job might come along that you're available for now.
one that's better.
that doesn't require a hepatitis-A shot.
and typhoid and yellow fever.
see?! That job blows.
Plus, now that you're not leaving,
we don't have to have, you know,
that talk about us that could have been really hard.
that's true.
not that it would've been hard. I mean...
I sort of know what I would have said, had we had to say stuff.
but luckily now we don't.
Yeah, you're right.
there are way better jobs out there.
you know, I probably shouldn't just jump at the first offer that comes to me.
right? - Right.
Hey, guys.
Oh. Am I interrupting.
no. - Yes.
um, I gotta make a few calls.
all right, I'll see you tomorrow.
and thanks for the talk. It helped.
get out! Are you guys a couple?!
Uh-uh. No. We're not sharing.
you wanna know why?
because you are grounded from all fun things,
including gossip, chit chat, delightful banter.
you are grounded from banter.
I know. That's why I came in here
to give you my stuff.
what is this?
these are a few of my favorite things.
and I would have sung that but that probably falls under the delightfulness rule.
well, your singing is delightful.
so, yes. We'll have none of that.
you're giving me your laptop and your phone?
and my new favorite swarovski crystal headband.
isn't she pretty? I haven't even worn her yet.
God, that one hurts the most.
Rose- - No, look.
I want you to know that I'm very serious about this, ok?
I did something that was really terrible.
and I want to prove to you that I'm going to be better.
or you're trying to kiss my ass so I reduce your sentence.
What?! No! No. No. That's not
you know what? Get out before I get even more upset at you.
well, fast, precise.
she didn't feel a thing.
I bet you're handy with the lacy delicates.
you should see me with a paring knife.
I mean, to cut food with.
not a brawl.
I'm not a serial killer or anything.
calm down, Luis. You had me at the diced onions.
now, there's a crate of coconuts in the downstairs pantry.
let's see if you're all you're cracked up to be.
do you want to go over the vocab one more time?
I can quiz you in the car.
Jordana's picking me up.
are you going to be mad at me forever?
so, French finals today?
Oul.
???
it's beginner French, Marco. I don't need to know all that.
you might. I remember last year,
my French teacher hit us with a whole new mess of stuff.
we weren't prepped for.
uh, I'm sorry. Are you talking to me?
Hi, I'm Luis.
he's new.
and now you want to touch me.
do you understand the concept of boundaries, Louis?
it's Luis.
it's irrelevant.
I'm Charlie's cousin. You know, Megan's friend?
more Megan people.
it's like we're in her own personal game of spore.
what's your name?
you don't need to know my name.
I'm your boss.
Oh, you're Laurel.
Wow. You look great for your age.
Ahh. I'm late for school.
nice to meet you.
I wish I could say the feeling was mutual, but I hate lying.
Ahh. Is it really 4: 00 a.m?
I know.
how did that happen?
I don't know.
do you hate me?
no.
no, not at all.
if anything, I hate myself for not being there for you.
it's late.
I should go.
Yeah.
why couldn't we just go to your place again?
you may be with Marco cooking, but I'm not.
because Rose is driving me crazy
trying to prove how dedicated she is to being grounded.
we could've gone to your place.
no, we can't. Mandy's there.
and we're kinda in the middle of a thing.
hmm. What kinda thing?
it probably started when I asked her to move in with me.
you what?!
how could you guys move in together?
you've only been dating for, like, a minute.
it doesn't matter anymore, because now she might not move in anyway.
OK. What happened? I need exact verbiage.
OK. She said, "Maybe we jumped the gun."
and that if I wanted, she could still look for another place.
and what did you say when she said that?
nothing.
Oww! What?!
you failed the test!
when she said, "maybe we jumped the gun,
you were supposed to say, "I don't think that we did."
wait, you just said that we did.
well, you did. But that ship has sailed.
you can't just put the offer out there and take it back.
what is wrong with men?
I'll give you an example.
when Will found out that he wasn't going to Brazil,
I told him, we didn't need to have the conversation about us.
but clearly I wanted to have the conversation,
which was obvious by my tone.
clearly obvious.
and when Mandy said, "maybe we jumped the gun,"
she was obviously just looking for a little reassurance
that you guys were doing the right thing.
but what if we're not?
I don't know. But if you like her, you should talk to her.
fair enough.
now, let me give you some advice.
like I need any, but go ahead.
will just lost a job, right?
probably the first real rejection the guy's ever had.
so instead of focusing on the imaginary test you thought you gave him,
why not try being the great girlfriend he needs right now?
it's a little on the simple side, but not bad.
Oh, good. You're here.
I've got some bags in the car that need fetching.
Hello? Bags are waiting.
now, sage, you know there's a whole separate fetching staff.
I'll go get the rest of the onions.
those are pretty earrings.
you know, you could probably feed a tiny nation with what they cost.
but they look nice on you.
Ugh! Fire him immediately!
I know you're bored and fighting seasonal depression.
but you can't just fire Willy Nilly.
Yeah. But he's making me feel bad about tiny nations.
and it's not my fault
Bup-Bup. Go find someone else to torture, Abu Sage.
that boy works in my department.
and unless you find a problem with his bearnaise or his beurre noir,
that boy's not going anywhere.
you have to talk to me eventually.
you might need my bone marrow some day.
this way. Keep 'em closed.
OK. - Ok.
just put these in my upstairs office.
Laurel, hi.
Hi, laurel. This probably looks odd.
I'm too tired to notice.
Goodnight.
wait. Wait. Wait.
how was your trip?
it was very nice. Thank you.
Really?
um, I'm starting to feel really awkward here.
just so you know.
we'll talk tomorrow.
have a good night you two.
OK. Keep it going. Keep 'em closed.
keep 'em closed.
and open!
what is all this?
welcome to your very own wallow hollow.
just listen, ok?
when I lived in New York,
I sent out a ton of resumes and short stories- The whole deal.
and as a result, I received a lot of rejection letters.
so, to get over that rejection,
I made up a little ritual for myself.
it started with a hot pastrami sandwich from the Carnegie deli.
and then I would go over to Rockefeller center
well, the holidays were the best time to get rejected,
because the ice rink would be up.
and the vendors would sell hot chestnuts.
and of course, the Christmas tree all lit up and beautiful.
after about an hour or so, I didn't even feel the rejection at all.
or you were just too numb to feel anything.
because Christmas in New York is wicked cold.
it takes a while to get over your first rejection.
but it does go away.
and I think it's important to wallow in the misery.
Ahh. Wallow hollow.
I didn't think you were much of a pastrami guy.
so I got you a sushi boat.
and I hunted down your favorite Japanese beer.
and I thought a night of Monty Python movies could cure anyone of a bad mood.
you are amazing.
I'm sorry I've been such a grouch.
this thing just really threw me.
of course it did.
I spent all last week thinking about it.
and I guess I just didn't realize how excited I got.
but now
wait. Um, "all last week"?
I thought you just got the job yesterday morning.
well, the official offer came yesterday.
but they basically told me it was a done deal last week,
when I met with Solano.
I'm confused.
look, it doesn't matter.
right? I have an awesome girlfriend,
a boatload of sushi, and Monty Python.
I got nothing to complain about.
what are you doing?
nothing. Go back to sleep.
what's going on, Rose?
I'm just leaving you a little surprise.
are those my jeans?
Oh, my god.
I know, I bedazzled them for you.
you be-What-Ed them?
sage and I used to do all of our James Perse T-shirts,
you know, to jazz 'em up a little.
and you always say how much you love our clothes.
on you.
because you're 16, and you can wear rhinestone jeans and crystal headbands.
come on, it's not like you're 30.
you're still young and vibrant.
you could add a ton more sparkle to your wardrobe,
especially for date nights like tonight.
what are you talking about? I don't have a date tonight.
you do now.
see, Jordana and I made a reservation at Maged, like, 2 months ago.
and because I'm grounded, I can't go.
so I called them up.
put the name under Will, so you guys can go instead.
Ahh. No. Do you hate Moroccan food?
because cous cous is pretty awesome.
no. I don't hate cous cous, Rose.
I can't go out with Will tonight
or any other night ever again.
maybe. I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Oh, no. What happened?
nothing. Nothing that I can talk to you about.
maybe I can help.
and helping is the same as doing a good deed.
and doing good deeds is a part of what being grounded is all about.
like community service for prisoners.
OK.
is there a guy that you like at school right now?
he wears a choker. It's hot.
OK. Well, let's just say hypothetically that Zachary wanted to be your boyfriend.
he even went out of his way to tell you that he wanted to be your boyfriend.
and of course you were psyched because you liked hypothetical Zach a lot.
Oh, who wouldn't? He's really hot.
right. But then you find out when hypothetical Zach asked you to be his girlfriend,
he already knew he was going to boarding school in Brazil for the next 6 months.
was he planning on doing the whole long distance thing?
he was not.
so, it was a bogus ask.
Uh-huh. Completely.
eww. I hate hypothetical Zach. - Me, too.
which is why you can see how I can't possibly have cous cous with him.
now, thank you for my bedazzley jeans.
and please go resume your prison sentence outside of my bedroom.
morning, Louie.
it's Luis.
regardless. I need you to make me a cassoulet.
Really? I would think someone of your stature wouldn't want to eat a peasant's dish.
huh. And I wouldn't think the kitchen staff would question a food request.
well, I wish I could help.
but Marco and I are busy with Laurel's dinner for the shareholders.
listen, apron.
let me run this down for you.
your job here may not require you to fetch my bags.
but you damn well have to make my food.
when a member of the Limoges family, such as myself,
requests a dish, it is up to you to figure out how to meet that request.
unless, you want me to tell my grandmother
that someone on our staff has no idea how to multitask.
and then of course Marco will get in trouble for hiring you,
and that will probably bring down your little pal Megan.
as you wish, madame.
but a proper cassoulet takes 2 days to prepare.
super. Lunch tomorrow then.
and don't be late.
I get really mean when my blood sugar's low.
what's you axcuse for the rest of the time?
I heard that.
I said it loud.
or if you have any laundry to do,
I- I'm an excellent folder.
nor do I handle the laundering here at the estate.
your job is pretty cakey, isn't it?
can I get it?
knock yourself out.
can I help you?
I'm here to see Laurel.
for you.
well, thank you.
did someone say
rose, uh, this is my friend Miles,
a business associate of mine.
this is my granddaughter Rose.
nice to meet you.
it's nice to meet you, Rose.
holy.
and this is Megan.
Megan, can you join me in my study?
I have some paperwork for you to sign.
and Rose, why don't you ask Arlene to put these in some water?
Oh, I'll do it.
what is he doing here?
he came to bring you flowers. It's so sweet.
Oh, and he's so cute.
he is, isn't he?
Oh, god, this is crazy.
I haven't told the girls yet.
and I certainly can't tell them like this.
your conference call is waiting.
for heaven sakes, Geraldine, learn to knock.
I've been saying that.
I'm sorry. Your conference call is on line one.
tell them to hold.
and you get Rose upstairs.
done.
and the pool is right down here.
Oh, we also have an indoor pool.
but that's more for special occasions,
like those 3 days of winter that we get.
rose, what are you doing?
you're supposed to be cleaning your room.
I am. - Let's go. Chop chop.
miles, join me.
I'm so sorry about that.
I didn't know what to say.
it's my fault. I should have called.
I wasn't thinking. I just thought it'd be romantic.
it is. I love that you're here.
it's just the girls don't know yet.
of course. Of course.
and Paris is waiting on the phone.
I'm gonna have Geraldine set you up in a room at the Breakers.
she doesn't have to. I've already booked a hotel.
don't be silly. I want to.
and I'll come as soon as I can.
Hey, where you going?
uh, I was gonna go grab a beer with Ali.
I wasn't sure what time your shift ended.
can we talk? I know you're mad.
I'm not mad. - Yes, you are.
you're mad because I failed the test.
the girl test.
you wanted me to say that you should move in.
when you told me not to stress out.
uh, no. I wanted you to stop stressing out when I asked you not to stress out.
what are you talking about?
well, I'm not sure. Megan said
you talked to Megan about us?!
is this a test?
why are you talking to Megan about us,
when you don't even talk to me about us?
what the hell's that about?!
I didn't know that we had a problem until Megan told me we did.
I mean- - The only problem we have is that you seem to think that every girl in the world is like your best friend.
but no offense, your best friend is nuts.
well, that's a little...
not the time. Understood.
she does not speak for all women.
and she definitely does not speak for me.
and the fact that you don't get that about me,
makes me even more relieved that I found an apartment today.
wait. What?
in coconut grove. It's less than what I was paying at my old place.
and almost an hour away.
Uh-Look, I can't do this right now, ok?
I'm late to meet Ali. It's not so bad.
we could always try the long distance thing.
Hi.
is everything all right?
is there something wrong with the room?
Nah. Room's great.
I've been enjoying it all day.
you've been waiting.
I should have called earlier.
it's after 9: 00, and I fell like an idiot.
I am so sorry.
the day just got away from me.
my meetings went longer than I thought.
it's my fault.
I shouldn't have come.
no. No. No. No.
I'm glad you came. It's just
it's just that you don't have time.
well, I could have made time if I knew you were coming.
and considering the situation with the girls,
it probably wasn't the best idea to show at my doorstep unannounced like that.
you showed up on my doorstep.
well, that was different.
how is that different?
because as much as I enjoy romantic sweeping gestures,
my granddaughters come first.
and your conference calls, and your servants.
how many of those do you have anyway?
are you upset because you've been waiting all day or because I have a staff?
because I won't apologize for the latter.
it's late, and I'm really not in the mood for dinner anymore.
fine.
neither am I.
there you are.
been calling you all day.
Uh-oh. You look upset. Did something happen?
kinda. Yeah.
what's bringing you down?
you. My boyfriend.
the boyfriend who had every opportunity to just be my friend and not get all committed.
then you had to go and be Mr. Romantic and make everything all boyfriend-girlfriendy all the while knowing in the back of your head
that you were never going to have to be my boyfriend
because you were leaving for Brazil.
Oh.
Oh"?
that's all you got?
I mean, I see why you're upset.
but that's not what happened.
you didn't ask me to be your girlfriend after you thought you were leaving the country?
Yeah. That happened. But not the way you're making it out.
I wanted to be with you.
right. And I wanted that job.
one thing had nothing to do with the other.
I just knew that I wanted both.
look. I'm sorry.
I mean his is???
right? I've never had to think about this stuff before.
I've never had to incorporate another person into my decisions.
and... it's hard.
shouldn't be that hard.
what do you mean?
I want someone who knows how to do this.
someone who knows what it means to be a boyfriend without me having to tell him every 2 minutes.
I just don't think you're ready for all of this, Will.
I just don't.
Oh no.
are those my grades?
Yep. I thought we could open them together???
were you sure this one's mine?
3 bs, 2 cs,
and an a- In french no less.
rose, this is amazing!
it's like a Christmas miracle.
I know!
now, I really don't understand.
it's bad enough that you tried to cheat, but you didn't even have to.
what were you thinking?
I was just thinking about you, I guess.
what do you mean?
it sounds stupid now.
but that's how it all started.
I mean, I knew that I let you down with my English final.
and I didn't want you to feel like you'd been wasting your time.
you know I would have been way less mad if you'd just gotten a bad grade.
I mean, lying and cheating is way worse than getting a d.
I know. Sage said the same thing.
see. You've reduced me to siding with Sage.
speaking of which,
when are you gonna stop torturing her?
all right, I'll make a deal with you.
next semester, I will ease up on the pressure and the study hours,
if you tell me when your head's about to explode.
deal. - Ok.
and because I feel a little responsible for all this,
I'm gonna take 2 days off of your grounding,
if you promise to never bedazzle anything of mine every again.
housekeeping let me in.
and it is your corporate suite.
that, too.
but why stir the pot.
I wanted to call you, but I don't have your number. And you're not listed.
I'm sorry about last night.
I never should have left like that.
I'm sorry, too.
I didn't mean those things I said.
I know my life is complicated.
I'm willing to make sacrifices.
but you have to meet me halfway.
I can't just give up everything I've worked for.
I'm not ready to do that.
you shouldn't have to.
good.
so let's make this work.
next week I'm in Paris.
but the week after, I'm here for 3 days before I go to new york.
and the one after that's a little bit difficult,
because we're launching this new skin line.
Laurel, stop. Listen to me.
you're right.
your life is more complicated than mine.
and you should be very proud of your accomplishments.
I am. I think you're amazing.
but not amazing enough to try and make this work.
there's nothing to try.
I lead a small, quiet life in California.
I'm at a point where I want someone at my side at my pace.
and you just can't do that right now.
and I've never been very good at waiting. You know that.
we've never had very good timing, have we?
maybe not.
but I'm glad that you found me again.
Wow. What's that smell?
4 hours of prep work. 6 hours marinating.
5 hours of slow cooked lamb, rabbit, and sausagey goodness.
did you say rabbit?
classic cassoulet.
that's what you wanted, right?
Yeah. But I didn't know that meant you'd be cooking thumper for dinner.
what?
sorry, honey. I don't do bunny.
then why did you ask me for it?
I thought it was like a casserole.
noodles are my fav.
any chance you can make me one of those?
hmm. That's what I'm talking about.
Hey! Got your report card in the mail today.
you did great.
how did Rose do?
you should ask her.
in case you haven't noticed, she hates me right now.
which sucks because that girl can hold a grudge forever.
now I doubt she will this time???
she knows you were looking out for her.
doesn't matter.
rose never lets anything go,
which is why you have to learn how to keep secrets better around her.
I can't imagine you keeping a secret from Rose for very long.
see, that's where you're wrong.
there are some things I'll never tell her.
sorry. The stupid pipe in my bathroom is still busted.
and I don't know where else to shower.
move in with me.
we jumped the gun.
we made a huge mistake without even thinking about it first.
that was dumb.
but I say we just figure it out.
because I like you, Mandy, a lot.
a lot, huh?
you're smart. You surf.
you look great in my towel.
and you call me on my crap.
well, that's sweet, but i'm not sure it's enough to sign a lease.
OK.
then how about the thought of never seeing you again freaks me out way more than the possibility that I'd be seeing you too much.
so move in with me.
OK.
you were right. I screwed up.
I would love to not be in these jeans right now.
just listen. Because I thought about this
and I just have to get it all out while it still makes sense.
I did ask you to be my girlfriend when I thought that I was leaving
because in the back of my mind,
I probably knew that if I didn't,
you'd never know how into you I was.
and I would have been gone. And you would have met somebody else.
and I just didn't want to lose you.
OK.
but then when I knew for sure that I was going,
I completely freaked out about what it would really mean to be in a long distance relationship.
because I've never even been in close distance relationship before.
and I ???
Uh-huh.
but now I screwed it up anyway.
and the worst part is that now I'm even more keenly aware of what an incredible girlfriend you are.
and the bottom line, Megan, is I want a second chance.
well, it would be a third chance.
balcony was your second chance kinda.
right.
well, I want a third chance.
look, I appreciate the thought and the rapid fire pace.
but, you know, kinda over apologies.
I mean, words are nice
but actions speak louder.
I agree.
come with me.
close your eyes.
I smell fried meat.
wait a minute.
I know that smell.
flown in from the Carnegie deli.
this is my man Frank.
and also...
wait for it.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
how did you
well, I know some people.
look, I've never done this before, so you're gonna have to help me out.
but I do know that part of being a good boyfriend is listening.
and big presents never hurt either.
well, you're a quick learner. I'll give you that.
OK, so Jordana and Breck
and Jordana passed out on the bathroom floor.
and her dad had to carry her.
it was so funny. And I'm just kinda upset
that they didn't really ask us to go. You know?
like, we're her best friends. What is that about?
do you ever watch U. F.C?
what?
ultimate fighting.
Oh, my god. I'm exhausted.
you REMEMBER MY COUSIN LUIS? HE WANTS TO BE A CHEF.
Hi. I--I'M LUIS.
he's NEW.
well, I LIKE MEGAN A LOT. - SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.
you WORRIED ABOUT HER? - SHOULD I BE?
my DAD WAS A DRUNK AND ILNERALLY UNEMPLOYED SINCE MY MOM LEFT.
I COULD SEE HOW MUCH YOU'VE CHANGED.
and I JUST THOUGHT THIS WOULD, YOU KNOW, BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO START OVER.
good.
OK. BECAUSE IT'S NOT A WORD. NO PROPER NOUNS.
come ON, I GAVE YOU WEEZIE.
Oh, WELL, DESPITE YOUR OBSESSION WITH THE JEFFERSONS,
WEEZIE IS NOT A NAME.
it's LIKE--OOH, IT'S ALLERGY SEASON. I'M FEELING WEEZIE.
what's UP WEEZIE? IT'S ME GEORGE. - OH, GOD.
get YOU ANOTHER SODA? - YES. PLEASE.
Oh, UH, DAD.
Wh--uh, IT SAYS SHELBY.
um, DO YOU KNOW ANY OTHER SHELBYS BESIDES MOM?
no. IT'S HER.
well, SHOULD I--HERE.
Shelby, HI.
Yeah, I DID.
no, I WASN'T PLANNING ON IT.
no. NO, I DON'T THINK THAT'D BE A GOOD IDEA.
well, I JUST DON'T.
Uh-huh. UH. UM.
Yeah, OK. THAT'S FINE.
fine. BYE.
I'm SORRY ABOUT THAT.
so, UM...
how OFTEN DO YOU TALK TO HER?
cause THAT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A FIRST-TIME-IN-16-YEARS KIND OF CONVERSATION.
not OFTEN. LITTLE MORE THESE PAST FEW MONTHS.
ever SINCE I SAW HER.
you SAW HER?
after I GOT SOBER, IT WAS PART OF THE PROGRAM.
I NEEDED TO MAKE AMENDS.
and I DROVE UP TO MEET HER IN ATLANTIC CITY.
that's WHERE SHE LIVES NOW.
we HAD COFFEE. SHE ASKED ABOUT YOU, OF COURSE.
that's IT. I MEAN, IT WAS NOTHING, REALLY.
so, WHY IS SHE CALLING YOU NOW?
funny THING ACTUALLY.
not THAT ANY OF THIS IS FUNNY.
but THIS WEEKEND IS OUR 30th HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.
and YOUR MOM AND I WERE KIND OF A BIG DEAL IN HIGH SCHOOL.
Yeah. PROM KING AND QUEEN. HEARD THE STORIES. WORKED OUT GREAT.
I GUESS SHE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE WHOLE THING AND THOUGHT IT SOUNDED FUN.
she JUST GOT INTO TOWN, AND SHE'S ON HER WAY OVER.
right NOW?! - YEAH. 10 MINUTES OR SO.
look, YOU HEARD ME SAY IT WASN'T A GOOD IDEA.
but SHE JUST RAILROADED ME. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
are YOU ALL RIGHT?
no. NO. I--I'M WEEZIE.
what ARE YOU DOING?
I READ THAT THE FINAL SLICE OF A GARLIC CLOVE IS THE MOST DELICATE.
you DON'T WANT TO WASTE ANY OF THIS.
you're A SOUS CHEF, LUIS. NOT A RABBI.
just CUT THE GARLIC.
I AM BEYOND EXHAUSTED.
Marco, I WILL PAY YOU TO MAKE ME A PROTEIN SHAKE.
your GRANDMOTHER ALREADY HAS THAT COVERED.
but I PM ACCEPT TIPS. SAGE, PROTEIN SHAKE?
I'll PASS. I AM HUNGRY, THOUGH.
make ME A SNACK, WOULD YOU LOUIE?
snack? I'M SUPPOSED TO MAKE A SNACK FOR SNOTTY SPICE?
unless YOU'RE TOO BUSY CHECKING OUT YOUR OWN REFLECTION IN A SPOON.
fine. WHEN I'M FINISHED WITH THIS,
I'll FIX YOU SOME APPLE SLICES WITH PEANUT BUTTER AND TURN ON BARNEY.
Luis, THE LADY OF THE HOUSE ASKED YOU TO MAKE HER A SNACK.
make HER A SNACK.
Hello, I SPEAK SOME SPANISH. I WATCH TELE-NOVELLAS.
he IS SO RUDE. MARCO, THAT GUY IS A DIVINE COOK AND A FESTIVAL FOR THE EYES, I AGREE.
I've LOST MY APPETITE.
wow, SAGE REALLY HATES LUIS, HUH?
Yeah. THE WAY I HATED LENNY FLECK IN THE 5th GRADE SO MUCH THAT I THREW A ROCK AT HIS HEAD EVERYDAY.
why DID YOU THROW A ROCK AT HIM?
because HE WAS BEAUTIFUL AND KNEW ALL THE WORDS TO I WILL SURVIVE.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS.
the WAY THOSE 2 HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS. COME ON...
Ohh! WAIT, SO YOU THINK THAT SAGE ACTUALLY LIKES LUIS.
well, OF COURSE, THAT MAKES SO MUCH MORE SENSE.
they ARE SO CUTE TOGETHER, TOO.
I MEAN, SHE'S ALL PEACHY CREAMY, AND HE'S ALL HOT AND TANNY.
and HE IS WAY SMART. OK.
every TIME SHE SAYS SOMETHING MEAN,
he JUMPS RIGHT BACK WITH SOMETHING EVEN MEANER.
I LOVE THIS. I DO.
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THEM TO START DATING.
well, I HATE TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE, BUT THE CHANCES OF SAGE DATING LUIS ARE ZERO.
before YOU GO OUT WITH SOMEONE, YOU HAVE TO FIRST ADMIT YOU LIKE THEM.
and THAT GIRL IS SO MESHUGA SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW SHE LIKES HIM.
that's YIDDISH FOR CRAZY.
Oh, SAGE ISN'T YIDDISH.
she's JUST SCARED TO LET ANYONE IN 'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GET HURT.
but IF SHE DOESN'T KNOW SHE LIKES LUIS,
then IT'S UP TO US TO HELP HER FIGURE IT OUT.
wait A MINUTE. WHAT "US"?
please. COME ON. I--I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS ON MY OWN.
and WELL, I CAN'T ASK SAGE FOR HELP ON THIS ONE.
fine. FINE. FINE. AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T INVOLVE ME WEARING A MUSTACHE OR USING A FRENCH ACCENT.
well, DEFINITELY NOT WEARING A MUSTACHE.
you KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO TAKE OFF, I'LL UNDERSTAND.
I CAN DEAL WITH IT.
you SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS ON.
I'm NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU HERE ANE WITH HER.
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN DOING SO WELL.
and I KNOW HOW SHE MESSES WITH YOUR HEAD.
no. WE WILL BE A UNITED FRONT.
all RIGHT. THANKS, SWEETHEART.
Oh, THANK GOD YOU'RE HOME. I'VE BEEN STUCK IN THAT CAR FOR AN ETERNITY.
Oh...
is THAT...
Megan AND I WERE JUST FINISHING LUNCH WHEN YOU CALLED.
why DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT SHE WAS HERE?
you DIDN'T REALLY GIVE ME A CHANCE.
no.
well...
you LOOK FANTASTIC.
I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED YOU.
probably NOT.
can I GET YOU SOMETHING?
well, I GOTTA PEE LIKE A RACEHORSE.
but I WOULD NOT ULNO TO A CUP OF COFFEE.
down THE HALL. FIRST DOOR ON THE RIGHT. - OK.
so...
I JUST...
Oh, HEY. DO YOU THINK THAT I COULD GET A TOUR OF YOUR BOAT?
uh, SURE.
I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK.
I'll CALL YOU LATER, ALL RIGHT.
Lilly, WHERE ARE YOU? WE NEED TO TALK. DEFCON 5.
Where's LILLY?
well, HELLO TO YOU, MISS FANCY PANTS.
how's PALM BEACH LIVING TREATING YOU?
it's FINE. BUT--I - JUST GOT THESE IN.

that's NOT-- I WOULDN'T SAY BURNT.
please DON'T MAKE ME EAT THAT! AHH.
a NEW TOASTER.
like THE DAY I DISCOVERED I COULD ACTUALLY MAKE GRILLED CHEESE IN THERE.
this IS A LASTING RELATIONSHIP I HAVE WITH THIS THING.
I'm SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.
??MEGAN, WHAT'S UP?
were YOU GUYS JUST ABOUT TO HAVE SEX RIGHT NOW?
because, I COULD JUST WAIT OUTSIDE.
what's GOING ON? ARE YOU OK?
well, LILLY GOT MARRIED. - WHAT?!

don't TELL ME.
sleazy SAMMY. - OH.

who IS SLEAZY SAMMY？
it DOESN'T EVEN MATTER BECAUSE OT EVEN THE BIG NEWS OF THE DAY.

who IS MOM?
I JUST SAW HER.- ERW HER?!
Yeah, SHE CAME OVER TO MY DAD'S HOUSE WHILE WE WERE HAVING LUNCH.
I'm PRETTY MUCH DYING RIGHT NOW.
I'm GONNA LET YOU GUYS DO THIS.
no, MANDY, DON'T GO. NO. I'M SORRY.
I JUST--I'M FREAKING OUT BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN MY MOM SINCE I WAS 7.
Oh...I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT. I'M SORRY.
it WAS SO D??
she WASN'T ANYTHING LIKE I THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE.
I ALWAYS IMAGINED THAT I WOULD RUN INTO ONE DAY
and SHE WOULD BE LIKE THIS CRAZY HOMELESS WOMAN ALL SCARY AND HAGGARD AND WHATNOT.
BUT...SHE'S PRETTY.
if I DIDN'T KNOW SHE'D ABANDONED HER FAMILY,
I WOULD THINK THAT SHE WAS A COMPLETELY NORMAL PERSON.
I DON'T THINK eHANDLE THIS, G HARLIE.
maybe WE SHOULD CANCEL OUR DOUBLE DATE TOMORROW NIGHT.
no. NO, I DON'T WANT TO CANCEL.
I've BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
and WE'VE HAD TO RESCHEDULE SO MANY TIMES.
Plus, I REALLY WANT YOU GUYS TO GET TO KNOW WILL.
although IF EITHER OF YOU WANT TO RUN ME OVER WITH A CAR RIGHT NOW, I UFOR THAT, TOO.
OK. AM I NUTS OR IS LUIS INCREDIBLY HOT?
Oh, YOU ARE AN ASSORTMENT OF NUTS. HE'S RUDE, ARROGANT.
just BECAUSE HE HAS AN ACCENT DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY MAKE HIM HOT.
Yeah, IT DOES.
Mmm.
it's A POT OF BOILING WATER.
well, I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA TURN IT INTO SOMETHING INCREDIBLE.
you ARE SUCH AN AMAZING CHEF. - THANK YOU.
Ooh. WHIP CREAM FROM SCRATCH.
pm I LOVE SWEETS.
that's SOUR CREAM.
Mm. THAT'S DELICIOUSLY SOUR.
Oh, MY GOD.
you REALLY SHOULD LABEL THESE THINGS!
I'll BE OUT OF HERE IN A MINUTE.
have YOU EVER NOTICED THAT MY SISTER IS A FULL-ON NYMPHO?
she's A TOTAL DAVID DUCHOVNY.
you SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW SHE WAS ALL OVER HIM, RAMI.
it WAS DISGUSTING.
all OVER WHO? - LUIS.
Really? I THOUGHT LUIS WAS YOUR MAN.
are YOU DRUNK?
no, HE'S NOT MY MAN. WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?
because YOU FIGHT LIKE LOVERS.
OK. FIRST, NEVER SAY "LOVERS" AGAIN.
and SECOND, DO PEOPLE THINK I'M INTO LUIS? - 10IT ALL T
Oh, MY GOD！
she IS UNBELIEVABLE.
that's WHY SHE'S DOING THIS WHOLE FLIHOIS--LI???
she THINKS THAT IF I THINK THAT SHE THINKS HE'S CUTE,
then I'LL THINK HE'S CUTE, TOO.
I DON'T THINK HE'S THAT CUTE. - BECAUSE HE'S NOT.
poor ROSIE.
doesn't SHE KNOW THAT I INVENTED THE JEALOUSY GAME?
I'm GONNA HAVE TO TEACH HER A LESSON ABOUT TRICKING YOUR SISTER.
by TRICKING YOUR SISTER.
lessons DON'T COME EASY, RAMI.
but I'LL NEED A WINGMAN.
are YOU WITH ME? - WHAT'S IN IT OR ME?
nothing. - I'M IN.
dad, IT'S ME AGAIN. WHY AREN'T YOU CALLING ME BACK?
I CALLED LILLY, AND SHE'S NOT ANSWERING HER PHONE.
well, I CAN'T LEAVE THIS FOR YOU ON YOUR VOICEMAIL,
so CALL ME, OK.
sorry.
you GOTTA START WEARING BELLS OR SOMETHING.
what's WRONG? YOU SEEM WIRED.
I CAN'T GET INTO IT.
but LONG STORY SHORT, LILLY GOT MARRIED.
Lilly GOT WHAT?
and MY MOM SHOWED UP TODAY.
and NOBODY'S CALLING ME BACK WHICH IS VERY ANNOYING.
I'm CONFUSED. I THOUGHT YOUR MOM HAS EEN OUT OF THE PICTURE FOREVER.
look, CAN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE?
cause I HAVE BEEN MOANING ABOUT THIS TO CHARLIE ALL DAY.
and I'M EXHAUSTED.
no PROBLEM.
I ACTUALLY CAME OVER HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING KIND OF INTERESTING.
I HAD DINNER WITH MY DAD LAST NIGHT.
he's TALKING ABOUT STARTING A NEW MAGAZINE.
you REMEMBER HOW J. F.K. JR. CREATED GEORGE?
trying TO MAKE POLITICS SEEM YOUNG AND HIP?
vaguely.
well, HE'S THINKING ABOUT DOING THE SAME KIND OF THING,
only INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON POLITICS,
he WANTS TO FOCUS ON YOUNG PHILANTHROPISTS.
giving RICH PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY A BETTER NAME.
exactly.
and I WAS THINKING
that IF SOMEONE CAME UP WITH AN IDEA FOR A FEATURE ARTICLE
for SAID FICTITIOUS MAGAZINE THAT MAYBE THE MAGAZINE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAPPEN.
you MEAN, YOU WANT ME PITCH YOUR DAD A STORY IDEA LIKE REAL WRITER?
well, IF IT WORKS, YOU COULD BECOME PART OF THE STAFF.
might BE A COOL OPPORTUNITY, DON'T YOU THINK?
I THINK YOU'RE COOL.
well, I WON'T FIGHT YA ON THAT.
Hi. COME ON IN.
I'm SORRY TO BARGE IN ON YOU LIKE THIS.
but I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT LILLY.
Lilly? OH, IS SHE COMING OVERTOO?
Hey, MAYBE WE COULD ALL HAVE BREAKFAST TOGETHER.
no. SHE'S NOT COMING OVER.
look, CAN I TALK TO YOU IN PRIVATE, PLEASE?
what's GOING ON? IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
I DON'T KNOW.
she DIDN'T PICK UP ANY OF MY PHONE CALL.
and SUPPOSEDLY SHE GOT MARRIED LAST WEEK.
married? TO WHO?
Oh, LILLY GOT MARRIED. THAT'S SO EXCITING. GOOD FOR HER.
no. IT'S ACTUALLY NOT GOOD FOR HER.
look, I THINK SHE GOT BACK TOGETHER WITH SAMMY.
maybe I SHOULD CALL HER?
is SAMMY SOMEBODY THAT I'D KNOW?
maybe HE'S SOMEBODY FROM THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD.
no. YOU WOULD NOT KNOW SAMMY.
because YOU DON'T KNOW ANY OF US. SO YOUR OPINION MEANS NOTHING.
MEGAN-- - I'M SERIOUS. THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
what DOES SHE THINK SHE'S DOING?
I'm JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY DAUGHTER'S NEW HUSBAND.
that's ALL.
you GAVE UP THE RIGHT TO CALL EITHER ONE OF US DAUGHTER WHEN YOU WALKED OUT.
I'm NOT DISCUSSING THIS WITH HER AROUND.
so, CALL ME WHEN SHE'S GONE.
sage, YOUR GUEST HAS ARRIVED.
Zachary, HEY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
Oh, IT'S, YOU KNOW, NO PROBLEM.
is--is ROSE AROUND?
rose? UM, I THINK SHE WENT SHOPPING.
Oh, OK.
Yeah. HAVE A SEAT.
uh, SO WHAT PART OF THE CHEMISTRY ASSIGNMENT DON'T YOU GET?
all OF IT. - OH.
OK. WELL, I GUESS
Yeah, I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THAT.
um, THE REAL REASON I ASKED YOU TO COME HERE WAS TO TALK ABOUT ROSE.
Oh, WHAT ABOUT HER?
um, WELL, SHE'S SUPER INTO YOU.
she TALKS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME.
she's ALL ZACHARY THIS AND ZACHARY THAT
OK, RAMI. - HE'S SO CUTE. AND OH, MY GOD. ZACHARY
RAMI!
uh, I HAD NO IDEA. THAT'S COOL.
um, OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW SHE'S AWESOME.
totally AWESOME.
so WHAT SHOULD I DO?
OK. ROSE IS A BIG-TIME ROMANTIC.
I MEAN, SHE'S SEEN THE NOTEBOOK, LIKE, 9 TIMES.
Really?
I LOVED THAT MOVIE.
um, YEAH MAYBE DON'T SHARE THAT WITH EVERYONE.
but SAY IF YOU COULD BE BACK HERE AT AROUND 6: 00?
bring SOME FLOWERS AND JUST BE YOUR DORKABLE SELF.
I CAN DO THAT.
great. AND YOU KNOW, DON'T BE AFRAID TO WORK THE LOOK A LITTLE BIT.
maybe SOME PRODUCT. YOUR CALL.
OK, SO IF I WERE TO PUT
question--what MAKES YOU THINK ROSE WILL BE INTO THIS BOY?
well, I ALREADY KNOW SHE THINKS HE'S HOT.
Plus, SHE ALWAYS GOES FOR THE UNDERDOGS.
but THE FACT THAT HE'S ALSO INTO HER WAS AN ADDED BONUS.
the GODS MUST BE SMILING DOWN ON US, RAMSTER.
you MIGHT BE RIGHT, SAGE-STER.
don't DO THAT.
well, SHE WAS LIKE,"OH, IT'S SO GREAT THAT LILLY'S GETTING MARRIED.
would I KNOW SAMMY?" AND I WAS LIKE, I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.
Oh, UH, WILL'S HERE. I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY LATER. BYE, CHARLIE.
Hi. - HI.
so, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE BLAZER? IS IT TOO MUCH?
I DON'T KNOW. WHERE YOU GOING?
I HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH VICTORIA TAYLOR.
she IS AN HEIRESS TO A TOBACCO FORTUNE
who STARTED A FOUNDATION TO HELP KIDS STOP SMOKING.
how GREAT OF AN IDEA IS THAT FOR AN ARTICLE?
you DON'T LIKE IT? IS IT TOO IRONIC?
does YOUR DAD HATE IRONY?
are WE OVER IRONY AS A NATION? I DON'T KNOW.
I GOTTA ASK YOU SOMETHING. NOT ABOUT THE MAGAZINE.
Oh, OK.
why DON'T YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT YOUR FAMILY STUFF?
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, I GUESS IT'S DEPRESSING
Yeah, BUT YOU TALK TO CHARLIE ABOUT IT.
Yeah, BUT HE KNOWS ALL THE PLAYERS. AND PLUS IT'S JUST EASIER.
well, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
no, I DON'T REALLY.
cause I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE DEAL IS WITH YOUR MOM,
other THAN THE FACT THAT SHE LEFT WHEN YOU WERE A KID.
look, I AM GOING TO BE LATE FOR MY INTERVIEW.
Yeah, OK. GOOD LUCK.
are WE STILL ON FOR DINNER TONIGHT?
sure. YEAH, I'LL PICK YOU UP AT 7: 00.
OK...
so ANYWAY, 2 YEARS AGO I DECIDED TO DONATE 3 MILLION
to THE LUNG CANCER UNIT AT MT. SINAI.
but ONCE I VISITED, I REALIZED I WAS PUTTING MY MONEY IN THE WRONG PLACE.
by THE TIME A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE GET TO THE HOSPITAL, IT'S TOO LATE.
so, I SAID, OK. HOW CAN I BE PART OF THE PREVENTION?
which IS HOW I CAME UP WITH MOVEYOURBUTT. ORG.
and HOW DID YOU DAD REACT WHEN YOU STARTED THE WHOLE THING?
my DAD?
Yeah, I MEAN HE MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY PISSED, RIGHT?
you GOTTA LOVE THAT.
he WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE, ACTUALLY.
come ON.
a TOBACCO HEIRESS SPENDING HER EXTRA CASH
shutting DOWN THE VERY INDUSTRYTHAT HER FATHER BUILT HIS ENTIRE FORTUNE ON.
I MEAN, THAT'S FREUDIAN STUFF.
you're MISINTERPRETING THE SITUATION.
Hey, I'M NOT JUDGING.
believe ME, I GET IT.
no, I DON'T THINK YOU DO.
I'm SORRY.
but THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF ARTICLE I WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN.
WAIT--VICTORIA.
it WAS NICE MEETING YOU.
how LONG YOU BEEN SITTING HERE?
uh, NOT SO LONG.
well, YOU'RE ALL DRESSED UP.
Yeah, WELL. I HAD AN INTERVIEW FOR AN ARTICLE I'M TRYING TO WRITE.
it SORT OF FELL APART,
just LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS SINCE YOU KNOW WHO SHOWED UP.
she's TAKING UP WAY TOO MUCH BRAIN SPACE.
Yeah, I KNOW. THAT'S WHY I CAME BY.
you DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE, DAD.
it's NOT YOUR FAULT SHE BLOWS INTO TOWN AND CREATES CHAOS.
I DIDN'T COME BY TO APOLOGIZE.
Oh.
I CAME BY BECAUSE I'M UPSET WITH YOU, MEGAN.
with ME?
I THINK YOU'RE BEING A LITTLE HARD ON YOUR MOTHER.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
hear ME OUT.
you DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE STORY.
and I THINK IT'S OUT TIME YOU DID.
I MADE A LOT OF PROMISES TO THAT WOMAN,
most OF WHICH I DIDN'T KEEP.
we NEVER PLANNED ON HAVING KIDS SO YOUNG.
did YOU KNOW YOUR MOM WAS A
she WANTED TO BE A SINGER WHEN SHE WAS YOUR AGE?
she WAS GOOD, TOO.
used TO WRITE ALL HER OWN SONGS. SO?
so. I SWORE I'D HELP HER PURSUE THAT DREAM.
and YOU CAME ALONG, AND I WAS FINE TO JUST BE A DAD AND STAY PUT.
I SETTLED INTO A ROUTINE RIGHT AWAY.
I NEVER NOTICED HOW UNHAPPY YOUR MOM WAS.
so, HER LIFE DOESN'T TURN OUT THE WAY THAT SHE WANTS,
so SHE GETS TO ABANDON HER ENTIRE FAMILY? GIVE ME A BREAK, DAD.
I DIDN'T SAY SHE HANDLED IT RIGHT.
she FEEL BADLY.
I KNOW SHE REGRETS SOME OF THE CHOICES
some OF THE CHOICES?
she's TRYING SWEETHEART.
she DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE.
well, I DISAGREE.
Why?
you FORGAVE ME.
you DIDN'T LEAVE ME WHEN I WAS 7 YEARS OLD, DAD.
drank MYSELF INTO SUCH A STATE THAT HALF THE TIME
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU OR YOUR SISTER WERE.
why ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?
you're ANGRY. I UNDERSTAND.
but YOU CAN'T LET IT OWN YOU, SWEETHEART.
you NEED TO FIND A WAY TO LET IT GO.
and HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO THAT?
by FORGIVING HER.
give HER THE CHANCE TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.
what IF I CAN'T?
if YOU CAN'T FORGIVE HER,
I DON'T WANT YOU TO FORGIVE ME.
good EVENING, ZACHARY.
Oh, GOOD EVENING...BUTLER.
is ROSE HERE?
I MEAN, I KNOW SHE IS BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT, RIGHT?
lovely FLOWERS. WELL DONE.
she's IN THE KITCHEN.
Oh, ROSE, YOU HAVE A GENTLEMAN CALLER.
Zach, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
well, UM
he CAME TO SEE YOU.
Yeah.
I THOUGHT IF YOU WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING, WE COULD, YOU KNOW, HANG.
Yeah.
Oh, UH--THESE ARE FOR YOU.
Oh, MY GOSH. THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. AND MASSIVE.
um, DO YOU WANT TO HELP ME PUT 'EM IN WATER?
Yeah, OK.
the EAGLE HAS LANDED.
what? - HE'S HERE!
Oh, FINALLY.
and DON'T CREATE CODE. IT'S WEIRD.
well, I SAY YOU DUMP THEM BOTH.
you OBVIOUSLY DID FINE WITHOUT EITHER ONE OF THEM RAISING YOU.
why TAKE TAKE ALL THEIR CRAP NOW?
maybe. IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING.
things HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER WITH MY DAD LATELY.
it's BEEN KINDA NICE HAVING HIM IN MY LIFE AGAIN.
well, MAYBE YOU CAN HAVE THAT WITH YOUR MOM, TOO.
if YOU TOOK THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO KNOW HER AGAIN.
the WOMAN'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN THROUGH A LOT.
I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE'S BEEN THROUGH.
doesn't AMOUNT TO A 1/10 A OF WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH BECAUSE OF HER.
what YOUR MOM DID IS TERRIBLE
but YOU WANT ME TO FORGIVE HER.
she DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME TO FORGIVE HER. MY DAD ASKED ME.
she PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN THINK SHE INSSED UP.
come ON, SHE KNOWS THAT SHE MESSED UP.
should WE GET SOME MORE CHIPS AND SALSA HERE MAYBE?
what DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS, CHARLIE?
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY QUIET.
I THINK THE SITUATION SUCKS.
I JUST KNOW HOW HARD MEGAN'S WORKS TO FIX STUFF WITH HER DAD H
and I KNOW HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO HIM.
I JUST HOPE THEY CAN GET THROUGH THIS WITHOUT DOING TOO MUCH DAMAGE TO THEIR RELATIONSHIP.
we ALL WANT THAT.
but THAT DOESN'T JUST MAGICALLY HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T TAKE ACTION.
like, YOU DON'T HAVE TO FORGIVE YOUR MOM.
but THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T PUT ON A GOOD FACE WHILE SHE'S HERE.
what DO YOU MEAN? FAKE IT?
she's HERE THROUGH THE WEEKEND, RIGHT?
just ACT LIKE YOU'RE OVER IT.
your DAD WILL FEEL BETTER AND EVERYTHING WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL.
and THEN SHE JUST GETS A FREE PASS FOR BEING A HORRIBLE MOTHER?
well, YOU'RE NOT DOING IT FOR HER.
you're DOING IT FOR YOUR DAD.
I HAVE TO GO TO THE RESTROOM.
excuse ME.
OK. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU PLAY THE FRENCH HORN.
it's TOTALLY MY FAVORITE HORN.
mine, TOO.
Plus, YOU KNOW HOW WHEN YOU PLAY IT YOU KEEP YOUR HAND INSIDE THE OPEN END?
well I USED TO STUFF STARBURSTS INSIDE
and TAKE ONE OUT WHENEVER MY INSTRUCTOR WASN'T LOOKING.
OD! THAT IS GENIUS!
Oh, HELLO, SAGE. ROSE, SAGE IS HERE.
Hi. YOU WANT SOME ICE CREAM?
no, THKS. WOW!
Zach, DID YOU GET THOSE FLOWERS FOR ROSE?
Yeah, I WAS GONNA GET HER ROSES BUT THEN I WAS LIKE, OBVIOUS MUCH.
isn't HE SWEET?
rose, CAN I SEE YOU FOR A MOMENT?
unless YOU DON'T MIND DISCUSSING YOUR LACTOSE INTOLERANCE IN FRONT OF THESE PEOPLE.
what ARE YOU DOING?! THAT WAS SO HUMILIATING!
you ARE OFFICIALLY THE WORST MATCHMAKER IN THE WHOLE WORLD.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - SAGE AND LUIS.
Ohh. RIGHT. SHOOT.
this WAS YOUR IDEA SWEETCHEEKS. I'M YOUR WINGMAN.
but YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE SAGE JEALOUS IF YOU'RE ALL OVER FRENCH HORNY BOY.
I AM SO SORRY. I JUST--I TOTALLY FORGOT.
Thanks, MARCO.
so, ROSE, YOU WANNA GO WATCH SOME TV?
um, NO. THANKS.
wow, LUIS, YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT CHOPPING VEGETABLES.
your HANDS ARE SO STRONG.
but THE WAY YOU DO IT IT'S JUST SO ARTFUL.
you're LIKE ONE OF THOSE GUYS AT BENIHANA.
I COULD WATCH YOU WORK FOR HOURS.
so, I GUESS I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.
you ARE?
I MEAN, OK. WHENEVER.
could YOU TEACH ME HOW TO CHOP?
come ON, ZACHARY. I'LL WALK YOU OUT.
first STEP IS--???
Yeah, I GET IT. THANKS A LOT.
are THEY MEDICATED?
Hey.
thank YOU, SIR.
please TELL ME IT'S OVER.
what? YOU DIDN'T ENJOY THE SPANISH INQUISITION AND THE RUNNY CHIMICHANGAS?
I AM NEVER GIVING ADVICE AGAIN. EVER.
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW ANNOYING IT WAS.
I'm SORRY.
it's NOT YOUR FAULT??
will DOESN'T GET IT.
well, IT'S A LOT TO GET.
have YOU TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT?
it's HARD. I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER.
and HE COMES FROM THIS, LIKE, PERFECT FAMILY.
his PARENTS ARE STILL TOGETHER GED ACTUALLY LOVE EACH OTHER.
Seriously? - YES. TOTAL FREAKS.
well, GIVE HIM SOME TIME.
it TOOK ME YEARS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE MADNESS THAT IS THE SMITH FAMILY.
but YOU'RE WORTH THE EFFORT. AND HE KNOWS THAT.
are YOU GOOD? - I'M GOOD.
it's JUST WEIRD THAT ZACH WOULD LEAVE SO SUDDENLY.
he SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE.
somewhere ELSE?
what LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOUSE?
did HE SAY, LIKE, MENTION A GIRL OR SOMETHING?
I CAN'T REMEMBER. BUT WHY DO YOU CARE?
you LIKE LUIS ANYWAY.
Oh, I KNOW.
well, I JUST
I DON'T WANT TO HURT ZACH'S FEELINGS. HE'S SO NICE.
eh, HE'LL LIVE.
but THE HEART WANTS WHAT THE HEART WANTS.
Yeah.
stupid HEART.
OK. WHO DID HE SAY HE WAS GOING TO SEE? I NEED TO KNOW!
I KNEW IT. YOU DON'T LIKE LUIS AT ALL, DO YOU? ADMIT IT.
OK. YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T.
so WHY WERE YOU PRETENDING TO LIKE HIM?
not THAT I DON'T ALREADY KNOW. BUT I WANT TO MAKE YOU SAY IT.
because I THOUGHT THAT DEEP DOWN YOU ACTUALLY LIKED LUIS.
you WERE JUST TOO SCARED-- - SCARED OF WHAT?
OK. I DIDN'T MEAN SCARED. I JUST
well, I JUST THOUGHT THAT MAYBE YOU NEEDED A LITTLE PROMPTING TO BRING OUT YOUR TRUE FEELINGS.
God, I REALLY SUEA AT THIS.
I KNOW. BUT IT'S FUN TO WATCH YOU TRY.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I LET ZACH GET AWAY.
he's SO CUTE AND SWEET. AND...FUNNY.
Yeah. HE GOT AWAY...
to THE BACKYARD.
I TOLD HIM TO WAIT BY THE POOL.
Oh, I LOVE YOU.
so, I GOTTA ASK. - YEAH.
you AND MEGAN--YOU STILL INTO HER?
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
she's IN THE BATHROOM RIGHT NOW WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
name's MANDY. REALLY CUTE.
Yeah, I KNOW YOU LIKED MEGAN.
I KNEW IT THAT DAY AT THE POOL PARTY.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU STILL DO.
I'm NOT YOUR PROBLEM, BUDDY.
I DIDN'T SAY I HAD A PROBLEM.
no, I KNOW YOU DIDN'T SAY IT.
you PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN THINK IT 'CAUSE YOU'RE KINDA COCKY.
but YOU DO HAVE A PROBLEM.
it's YOU.
is THAT RIGHT?
look, I KNOW YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO CATCH UP.
and I'M SURE MEGAN'S NOT MAKING IT EASY ON YA.
she's PRETTY MESSED UP WHEN IT COMES TO HER FAMILY.
but THEIR PROBLEMS ARE SERIOUS.
and THEY RUN PRETTY DEEP.
if I WERE YOU, I WOULDN'T GO FIRING OFF IDEAS ON HOW TO FIX THINGS
or THROWING OUT SOME HALF-BAKED OPINION JUST TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING.
Yeah, AND IF I WAS YOU, I'D KEEP THE ADVICE TO MYSELF.
Hey, ARE WE READY?
Absolutely.
I'll TALK TO YOU LATER, MEGAN.
Bye. - BYE.
you OK?
I'm FINE. I'M JUST TIRED.
me, TOO.
Hey, DAD, IT'S ME. UM, IS MOM THERE?
I HATE YOU, WILL. I HATE YOU, WILL.
Hey, MOM. IT'S--IT'S MEGAN.
um, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TOMORROW?
can I HELP YOU?
Where's LUIS?
I CALLED DOWN ON THE INTERCOM 10 MINUTES AGO FOR HIM TO MAKE ME A SMOOTHIE.
I CAN MAKE THAT FOR YA.
Oh, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'm SURE LOUIE CAN FIGURE IT OUT.
I FIRED HIM THIS MORNING.
fired LIKE GONE?
Yeah. AND I'M SORRY IT TOOK ME THIS LONG.
I MEAN, HE MAY HAVE BEEN AN EXCELLENT SOUS CHEF,
but HE WASN'T WORTH ALL THE DRAMA THAT CAME WITH IT.
and I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT TAKING YOUR INPUT SERIOUSLY WHEN YOU FIRST ASKED.
Oh, UM. THAT'S OK.
but I KINDA FEEL BAD.
I MEAN, HE PROBABLY NEEDED THE JOB, RIGHT?
well, EVERYBODY NEEDS A JOB.
but NOT EVERYONE GETS TO WORK HERE.
now, WHAT KIND OF SMOOTHIE WOULD YOU LIKE, HONEY.
cause I'M GONNA MAKE IT FOR YOU.
uh, YOU KNOW ON SECOND THOUGHT, I'M NOT THAT HUNGRY.
Thanks, MARCO.
30th HIGH SCHOOL REUNION. UGH, IT MAKES ME SOUND SO OLD.
but, YOU KNOW, I DON'T FEEL OLD.
well, IT'S HOW YOU FEEL, RIGHT?
isn't THIS FUN? ??
of COURSE IF WE HAD DONE THIS WHEN YOU WERE TEENAGERS,
we'd BE FING OUR NUTS OFF. HUH?
or MAYBE IT'D BE NICE.
I KNOW THAT I MISSED A LOT.
and I WISHED THAT
you KNOW WHAT? IT'S OK.
it's WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE, RIGHT?
Yeah.
so, TELL ME EVERYTHING. DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?
Oh, YEAH. YOUR DAD TOLD ME THAT YOU WANT TO BE A WRITER.
that SOUNDS LIKE FUN.
it IS FUN. IT'S VERY FUN.
you UM, ACTUALLY YEAH.
I'm TRYING TO COME UP WITH AN ARTICLE FOR THIS NEW MAGAZINE.
it's ALL ABOUT YOUNG PHILANTHROPISTS THE CHARITIES THEY DONATE TO.
Yuck. WHO WANTS TO READ THAT?
excuse ME?
I'd RATHER POKE A NAIL FILE IN MY EYE
than READ ONE MORE PIECE OF GARBAGE ???
it's ABOUT THE PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO FIX.
yeah WITH THEIR MONEY. BIG WHOOP.
if I HAD $1 MILLION, I'D THROW SOME COIN AT CANCER, TOO.
I'd LIKE TO READ ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK
huh? NOW YOU SEE, THAT'S A STORY.
ACTUALLY...YOU HAVE A POINT.
see, THIS IS THE KIND OF INTELLECTUAL CONVERSATION THAT I HAVE BEEN MISSING.
it's TOO BAD LEAVING TOMORROW.
something IN RED, FINALLY.
OK. SO YOU KNOW HOW YOUR DAD IS ALL GUNG-HO
about DOING A MAGAZINE THAT FOCUSES ON THE SUPER RICH?
well, WHAT IF THAT FOCUS WAS JUST THE BEGINNING?
meaning WHAT?
OK. WHAT IF THE MAGAZINE IS DEDICATED TO HOW A CHARITY OPERATION WORKS?
each MONTH WE CAN FOCUS ON DIFFERENT CAUSES AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED.
I MEAN, THIS WAY EVERYONE'S COUNTED.
you KNOW, NOT JUST THE UBER RICH.
and WE CALL THE MAGAZINE RIPPLE.
like THE RIPPLE EFFECT.
nice. - REALLY?
Yeah. WHAT MADE YOU COME UP WITH IT?
it ACTUALLY CAME OUT OF A CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH MY MOM.
I SAW HER THIS AFTERNOON.
Oh, YEAH. HOW'D THAT GO?
it WENT OK, ACTUALLY.
you WERE RIGHT.
it WAS MUCH EASIER TO SUCK IT UP FOR AN AFTERNOON THAN TO FIGHT WITH MY DAD FOREVER.
so, ANK YOU. - ANYTIME.
did YOU TELL CHARLIE? - NOT YET, NO.
n YOU KNOW THERE'S NOTHING TO BE JEALOUS ABOUT, RIGHT?
I KNOW.
but IT'S NOT JUST THAT.
you GAVE ME A LOT OF CRAP ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GOOD BOYFRIEND.
and I TOOK IT TO HEART.
wc I'M TRYING OVER HERE.
but YOU HAVE SOME WORK TO DO IN THE GIRLFRIEND DEPARTMENT.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
you're NOT SO GREAT WITH THE SHARING.
and FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD, SHARING IS A BIG DEAL
when IT COMES TO THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP THING.
you're RIGHT.
I'll DO BETTER.
yeah? - YEAH.
relationships ARE A LOT OF FREAKIN' WORK, THEY?
no WONDER I'VE BEEN AVOIDING THEM MY WHOLE LIFE.
I KNOW. THEY SEEM TO INVOLVE A WHOLE LOT OF TALKING.
right?
well...
how ABOUT WE MAKE OUT FOR 10 MINUTES,
and THEN I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT THE STUFF
that MY MOM DID AT MY 6th BIRTHDAY PARTY. IT'S A REAL FREAK SHOW.
make IT 20 MINUTES AND YOU'RE ON.
and WE MUST HAVE TALKED FOR LIKE 4 HOURS STRAIGHT.
I MEAN, ZACH AND I ACTUALLY HAVE SOME STUFF IN COMMON.
that's GREAT.
we BOTH LOVE JON STEWART. WE BOTH HATE GARBANZO BEANS.
and YOU THINK HE'S CUTE, RIGHT?
as A BUTTON.
what's WRONG? YOU SEEM ALL BLUE.
Oh, UM, I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE I HAD TO MISS MY MORNING MASSAGE.
or COULD IT BE THAT YOU'RE MISSING SOMETHING ELSE OR SOMEONE?
cr WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
well, I MEAN--WHAT'S DIFFERENT IN YOUR LIFE THAT COULD BE MAKING YOU SAD? PM
ew UM, LET'S SEE...
Oh, WELL, LUIS IS GONE.
Oh, BUT YOU DON'T LIKE HIM. SO...
do YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT I DO?
I DON'T KNOW.
kinda SEEMED LIKE YOU DID.
and IT KINDA SEEMED LIKE HE LIKED YOU BACK.
Really?
Oh, COME ON. ALL THAT FIGHTING?
it WAS SO ASHTON AND CAMERON IN THAT VEGAS MOVIE.
I GUESS IT KINDA WAS, WASN'T IT?
you KNOW...
it's OK TO LET YOUR GUARD DOWN EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. A
doesn't ALWAYS HAVE TO TURN O BADLY.
but WHAT IF I'M NOT FUN?
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU'RE SUPER FUN.
Yeah. WITH YOU AND, LIKE, PARTIES AND STUFF.
but YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING,
school JUST COMES EASY FOR ME?
well, ING ADORABLE COMES EASY FOR YOU.
it's A GIFT, ROSE.
you SHOULD CHERISH IT.
so, YOU DO LIKE HIM?
well, I GUESS I DID.
but IT'S TOO LATE NOW. HE'S GONE. AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
I'm SUCH AN IDIOT.
I'm SORRY, SWEETIE.
Hey, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED-- A LITTLE COMFORT FOOD.
will DO.
guess LUIS ISN'T FIRED.
WHAT--I'M GONNA KILL YOU!
I KNEW YOU LIKED HIM!
you ARE SO DEAD!
Oh, HEY, HON. COME ON IN.
Hey, KIDDO. WANT SOME EGGS?
just HAVING A LATE BREAKFAST.
or AN EARLY LUNCH DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.
what's GOING ON? I THOUGHT THAT YOU HAD AN EARLY MORNING FLIGHT.
well, YOUR DAD AND I HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME AT THAT REUNION LAST NIGHT
and THEN ME AND YOU HAD SUCH FUN SHOPPING,
it JUST SEEMED SORT OF SILLY JUST TO RUSH OFF.
so YOU BOOKED A LATER FLIGHT?
uh, NO. I'VE TALKED TO YOUR DAD.
and I'VE DECIDED THAT I'M JUST GONNA STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
Oh, WE'RE GONNA HAVE SUCH A GOOD TIME.
you AND I AREN'T PERFECT EITHER.
maybe I DON'T WANT TO SETTLE.
what HAPPENED? - WE BROKE UP.
mom's HOME?
she CAME HOME A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
you ALL SAT AROUND LIKE A PERFECT LITTLE FAMILY
and DECIDED TO LEAVE ME HERE?
you GAVE MY MOM THE MONEY TO BAIL LILY OUT OF JAIL, DIDN'T YOU?
Yeah, I DID.
the CHARGES AGAINST ME WERE DROPPED.
mom BAILED YOU OUT. SHE WENT DOWN THERE. - NO, SHE DIDN'T.
I NEVER SAW MOM.
Where's MOM? - WENT TO GET HER HAIR DONE THIS AFTERNOON.
I'm SURE SHE'S ON HER WAY HOME.
I DON'T THINK SHE IS.
stupid PHONE.
stop THE CHECK.
whoa. WHAT CHECK?
the CHECK THAT YOU GAVE MY MOM TO BAIL LILY OUT OF JAIL.
you NEED TO CANCEL IT.
unless YOU GAVE HER CASH.
please TELL ME THAT YOU DID NOT GIVE MY MOM A BRIEFCASE FULL OF CASH.
no, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT IN MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.
what IS GOING ON? - LILY WASN'T BAILED OUT.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU SAW HER.
she WAS RELEASED FROM JAIL.
they FOUND SLEAZY SAMMY ON HIS WAY DOWN TO ACAPULCO,
and THE CHARGES AGAINST LILY WERE DROPPED.
and MY MOM IS GONE.
and SO IS YOUR $25, 000 CHECK.
wait, WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE'S GONE?
OK, LOOK, I WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING LATER,
but RIGHT NOW I NEED LESS TALKING
and MORE CANCELLING OF CHECKS.
the BANK IS CLOSED.
you're A BILLIONAIRE!
I MEAN, ISN'T THERE A SPECIAL HOTLINE FOR YOU GUYS?
right. 1-800-I'M RICH.
that's NOT ENOUGH NUMBERS.
all RIGHT, I'LL CALL MY ACCOUNTANT.
that's A GOOD PLAN.
hello THERE.
Hi. - AND WHO MIGHT YOU BE?
Oh, HI.
I'm MEGAN SMITH.
I'm WILL'S GIRLFRIEND.
sorry, IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE SWEATY.
the MEGAN SMITH?
heh, YEAH.
well, I'M WILL'S DAD.
it's GREAT TO FINALLY MEET YOU.
Mr. DAVIS.
Hi. - HI.
I'll JUST TAKE THAT BACK.
so, SIR, IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU HERE.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE STILL IN LONDON.
please, CALL ME TOM. - OH.
will TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU.
my WIFE'S GOING TO BE SO DISAPPOINTED SHE MISSED YOU.
she's ALREADY IN BED.
Oh, I WISH I WAS THERE.
well, UM, NOT WITH HER.
I JUST, YOU KNOW, I'M ALSO VERY TIRED AS WELL.
what ARE YOU DOING THIS WEEKEND?
can YOU COME OVER FOR DINNER ON FRIDAY?
M--UH, YEAH. MM-HMM. YEAH, SURE. YEAH.
uh, YEAH. THANK YOU. - HEY, WILL,
I've JUST INVITED YOUR LOVELY GIRLFRIEND OVER FOR DINNER FRIDAY NIGHT.
I GUESS YOU CAN COME, TOO.
all RIGHT, THE JETLAG HAS FINALLY TAKEN HOLD.
I'm GONNA HIT THE SACK.
Megan, LOOKING FORWARD TO FRIDAY.
Mm-hmm. ME, TOO.
good NIGHT. - GOOD NIGHT.
did YOU CANCEL THE CHECK?
she CASHED IT THIS MORNING.
what?
Oh, MY GOD, SHE DID? SHE CASHED IT.
Oh, MY GOD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING.
Yeah. I KIND OF CAN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER.
I THOUGHT MAYBE I WAS WRONG,
maybe SOMETHING HAPPENED, BUT NO.
no, SHE JUST... SHE LEFT US.
again.
she JUST LEFT US AGAIN.
I'm SO SORRY, WILL.
I'm SO EMBARRASSED.
don't BE. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS.
I--I CAN'T PAY YOU BACK.
you DON'T HAVE TO.
none OF THIS IS YOUR FAULT.
so YOUR DAD INVITED ME OVER FOR DINNER FRIDAY NIGHT.
Yeah, I HEARD THAT.
think HE'LL MIND IF YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S MOM'S A FELON?
it's A 4-DAY SEMINAR AT THE CULINARY INSTITUTE IN SAN FRANCISCO.
luis IS THE YOUNGEST IN HIS CLASS BECAUSE HE'S SUCH A GENIUS.
I...I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GIRLS WALK SO FAST IN THOSE HEELS.
rose COULD TEACH YOU.
you GUYS ARE PROBABLY THE SAME SIZE.
Oh, HEY, ARE YOU FREE TONIGHT?
the AERO THEATRE IS SHOWING ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOND MOVIES-- GOLDFINGER.
Oh, I WISH I COULD,
but SAGE AND I HAVE TO GO TO THIS PARTY THING.
what IS IT AGAIN?
a RECORD RELEASE.
I DON'T KNOW WHO THE ARTIST IS,
but APPARENTLY RIHANNA'S GONNA BE THERE.
Rihanna? NO WAY.
how'd YOU SCORE THOSE INVITES?
our PUBLICIST.
Yeah, I WISH I COULD TAKE YOU,
but SHE DIDN'T GIVE US ANY PLUS ONES.
Oh, THAT'S--THAT'S OK. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
call ME AFTER?
OK, SERIOUSLY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
you're DATING A MATHLETE.
and YOU WON'T EVEN MAKE FUN OF HIM.
is YOUR PART DIFFERENT?
your NOSE LOOKS GIGANTIC TODAY.
thank YOU.
Bye.
it's THE LITTLE THINGS.
what DID YOU DO TO THE FRIDGE?
Oh, I COULDN'T SLEEP.
Ahh. THAT MAKES TWO OF US.
I'm NOT READY TO TALK ABOUT IT YET, MARCO.
and, UM, WHERE DID THE COFFEE MUGS GO?
corner CABINET.
I REARRANGED THE WHOLE KITCHEN.
it's MORE EFFICIENT THIS WAY.
haven't HEARD FROM KEITH?
Nope.
you OK?
or ARE YOU NOT READY TO TALK ABOUT IT EITHER?
and 4 MORE REFRIGERATORS TO ORGANIZE.
but AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE IN THE HEALING POWER OF ROSS AND RACHEL,
it IS NOT WHAT I RECOMMEND FOR A BREAKUP.
the ONLY WAY TO GET OVER A BOYFRIEND IS TO MAKE A BIG CHANGE.
you HAVEN'T SEEN THE PANTRY YET.
in YOUR LIFE.
like WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW. CHANGE YOUR ROUTINE.
uh, START A NEW CLASS AT THE GYM.
because I'M FAT? - NO. NO, NO. NOT AT ALL.
paint YOUR ROOM A NEW COLOR?
laurel WOULD KILL ME. - CHANGE YOUR HAIR?
I'm NOT 16 OR A GIRL OR WHITE.
OK, THERE MUST BE SOMETHING.
look, YOU'VE BEEN FOCUSING WAY TOO MUCH ENERGY INTO KEITH.
we JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO REDIRECT IT TO MAKE A POSITIVE CHANGE.
america's MOST WANTED, 2 O'CLOCK.
Hey, LILY.
I WANT MOM'S NUMBER.
I DON'T HAVE IT. - HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
I DID HAVE IT. IT'S BEEN DISCONNECTED.
trust ME, I TRIED CALLING IT LIKE A MILLION TIMES LAST NIGHT.
you're SERIOUSLY NOT GOING TO GIVE ME MY OWN MOTHER'S NUMBER?
what PART OF "IT'S DISCONNECTED" DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
look, IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, CALL DAD, ASK HIM.
why SHOULD I BELIEVE EITHER ONE OF YOU?
look, I KNOW HOW YOU MUST FEEL.
you HAVE NO IDEA HOW I FEEL.
mom WAS HERE ALL THIS TIME
and YOU NEVER ONCE CALLED ME?
I DID CALL YOU.
you WERE ON YOUR HONEYMOON WITH YOUR DRUG DEALER HUSBAND, REMEMBER?
tell DAD TO GET CALL WAITING.
I've BEEN CALLING HIM ALL MORNING AND THE LINE'S BUSY.
reddish HAIR. 5'4" AND THREE QUARTERS.
Yeah, SOMETIME YESTERDAY.
I CAN'T BE SURE WHEN.
please, DON'T TRANSFER ME AGAIN.
Yes, I'LL HOLD.
Hi, HONEY. - WHAT'S GOING ON?
I've BEEN TRYING TO FILE A MISSING PERSONS REPORT.
they KEEP TELLING ME I HAVE TO-- - YOU HAVE TO WAIT 24 HOURS, I KNOW.
that's RIDICULOUS.
think WE SHOULD TRY CALLING HOSPITALS?
no. - WELL, THE COPS AREN'T DOING ANY GOOD.
dad, DOES ANY OF THIS FEEL FAMILIAR?
filing MISSING PERSONS REPORTS,
calling THE HOSPITAL.
this IS NOT LIKE LAST TIME, ALL RIGHT.
your MOTHER WOULDN'T JUST DISAPPEAR.
that's EXACTLY WHAT SHE WOULD DO.
that's EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID DO.
that WAS DIFFERENT.
she WAS UNHAPPY THEN.
things HAVE BEEN GOING REALLY GREAT FOR US THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.
we WERE EVEN TALKING ABOUT FINDING ANOTHER PLACE.
she STOLE $25, 000 FROM WILL.
what?
she ASKED WILL FOR THE MONEY TO BAIL LILY OUT OF JAIL,
and HE GAVE IT TO HER,
but SHE DIDN'T USE THE MONEY FOR BAIL.
she DIDN'T EVEN GO TO SEE LILY AT ALL. I ...
she LIED TO WILL.
she LIED TO ALL OF US.
so LILY IS-- - SHE'S OUT.
the CHARGES AGAINST HER WERE DROPPED.
she's BEEN TRYING TO CALL YOU ALL MORNING,
but YOUR PHONE'S BEEN BUSY.
dad, I'M SO SORRY.
look, I KNOW HOW AWFUL ALL OF THIS IS
and I JUST--I JUST-- I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET SICK OVER THIS AGAIN.
I JUST...YOU HAVE WORKED SO HARD TO
...? ARE YOU THERE?
Hello?
Yes. YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
5'4."
reddish BROWN HAIR.
no.
well, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
so I DIDN'T KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT WHEN YOU SAID COME OVER FOR LUNCH.
I'm SORRY. I JUST... I HAD TO GET MY MIND OFF OF EVERYTHING.
are YOU HUNGRY? DO YOU WANT A SANDWICH?
relax FOR A SECOND.
but...
I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD FROM MY DAD.
you JUST SAW HIM A FEW HOURS AGO.
he's PROBABLY PROCESSING EVERYTHING.
he's NOT PROCESSING ANYTHING, HE'S IN DENIAL,
which IS EXACTLY HOW HE HANDLED THIS THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED.
I SHOULD CALL CHARLIE AGAIN.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID HE WENT TO VISIT HIS GRANDPARENTS.
he DID. - SO WHAT CAN CHARLIE DO?
you're SPINNING. JUST TAKE A BREATH.
look, I JUST DON'T WANT MY DAD TO FALL INTO HIS OLD PATTERNS AGAIN.
he's BEEN SOBER FOR LESS THAN 2 YEARS,
and... THIS IS A LOT FOR HIM TO HANDLE.
look, I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT HIM,
but I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
me? I'M FINE.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE I'M EXACTLY SHOCKED BY THIS.
I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT FOR FALLING FOR HER CRAP AGAIN,
but I'M FINE.
so YOU DON'T THINK THAT YOU'RE FALLING INTO OLD PATTERNS AGAIN?
I'm JUST ASKING. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
OK, WHEN YOU FIRST GOT DOWN HERE, YOU DIDN'T CALL YOUR DAD
because YOU WERE AFRAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO GO BACK TO HOW IT WAS BEFORE YOU LEFT FOR SCHOOL, RIGHT?
RIGHT...ISH.
basically RIGHT.
right. AND YOU DIDN'T WANT YOUR FAMILY RELYING ON YOU TO CLEAN UP THEIR MESSES AGAIN, RIGHT?
this IS WHAT YOU TOLD ME. I'M JUST CONFIRMING HERE.
Yeah, OK.
right. AND SO HERE YOU ARE,
and ONCE AGAIN, EVERYTHING'S FALLING APART.
and ONCE AGAIN YOU'RE BOUNCING OFF THE WALLS TRYING TO KEEP IT TOGETHER.
well, BECAUSE IF I DON'T, WHO WILL?
you THINK THEY WILL?
I JUST THINK THAT YOU SHOULD GIVE THEM A CHANCE
to SEE IF THEY CAN PULL THEMSELVES TOGETHER WITHOUT YOU.
so YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD DITCH MY FAMILY?
I'm JUST SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD TRY AND CREATE SOME BOUNDARIES, ALL RIGHT.
sometimes PEOPLE ALLOW THEMSELVES TO FALL APART
because THEY KNOW OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE THERE TO FIX IT.
are YOU CALLING ME AN ENABLER?
if THE CRUTCH FITS.
interesting.
suddenly I BECAME EXTREMELY TIRED.
take A NAP.
all RIGHT, I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
wait, DON'T I HAVE DINNER WITH YOUR FAMILY TONIGHT?
that's TOMORROW NIGHT.
and MY MOM IS COOKING CHICKEN MARSALA,
so BE SURE TO TELL HER THAT YOU LOVE IT.
chicken MARSALA? THAT'S MY FAVORITE.
I KNOW.
elyse VALENCOUR IS ON LINE TWO.
again?
did YOU FIND OUT WHAT IT'S REGARDING?
I TRIED, BUT SHE WON'T SPECIFY.
then TAKE ANOTHER MESSAGE.
I'm SORRY, BUT MARCO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
of COURSE.
because CLEARLY NO ONE IN THIS HOUSE WANTS ME TO GET ANY WORK DONE TODAY.
show HIM IN.
is THIS ABOUT TOMORROW NIGHT'S MENU?
no. ACTUALLY, I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR OFFER.
my OFFER?
to HELP ME OPEN MY OWN RESTAURANT.
well.
we HAVEN'T VISITED THIS TOPIC IN SOME TIME.
I KNOW. BUT WHEN I FIRST STARTED HERE,
you MENTIONED YOU'D BE WILLING TO HELP ME GET UP AND RUNNING WHEN THE TIME CAME.
I TAKE IT THE TIME HAS COME?
I GOT A TIP ON A REALLY GREAT SPACE AND IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE SOON.
I PUT A FEW FIGURES TOGETHER,
and I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
very GOOD.
why DON'T YOU ORGANIZE YOUR NOTES
and GIVE IT TO GERALDINE WHEN YOU'RE READY.
well, I'M READY NOW.
my.
hmm.
LOTTA! HEY, I LOVE YOUUR DRESS.
Oh, LOTTA LOVES YOU.
do THEY HAVE THAT DRESS IN MY SIZE?
Oh, MY GOD, LUIS TEXTED ME.
no WAY. WHAT DOES IT SAY?
Hey, BABE. - OH, HE CALLED YOU "BABE.
I KNOW.
first DAY OF SER WAS CRAZY.
asked US TO CREATE OUR OWN QUICHE RECIPE.
I CALLED MINE QUICHE SAGE.
can't WAIT TO MAKE IT FOR YOU.
he NAMED A QUICHE AFTER ME.
that IS SO ROMANTIC.
have YOU HEARD FROM ZACH?
no. I THINK HE WENT TO THAT MOVIE.
but IT'S ALMOST 10: 00. HOW MUCH LONGER DO WE HAVE TO STAY HERE?
I DON'T KNOW. I'M KIND OF OVER IT.
you WANT TO GO?
Yeah, DEFINITELY.
that's WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
Hey, GORGEOUS.
Hey, MAX.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
my BUDDIES MANAGE THE BAND.
Hey, YOU MEET MY BOY PETE?
Hi. - CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?
uh, NO THANKS.
she LOVES CHAMPAGNE.
Hey! YO, WAITER. - WAITER!
she SAID NO THANKS.
Hey, PETE. OVER HERE, MAN.
picture.
Thanks. - NO PROBLEM.
don't DO THAT.
hugh HEFNER CALLED. HE WANTS HIS JACKET BACK.
Hi.
that's NEW.
Yeah. MY DAD GOT IT IN RUSSIA.
that's WEIRD.
Yeah. LOOK, I'M HEADING OUT TO MEET SOME BUDDIES.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
sorry, I JUST...
well, I'M JUST GONNA GET RIGHT TO THE POINT, I GUESS.
did YOU MEET MY MOM WHEN SHE WAS HERE?
Yeah, I DID.
do YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND HER?
I DON'T. LOOK, MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO MEGAN.
I've TRIED.
but NOTHING SHE'S SAYING IS MAKING ANY SENSE.
all I KNOW IS THAT MY MOM WAS HOME,
and NOW SHE'S GONE.
and I DON'T KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY WENT DOWN.
but YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN STRAIGHT WITH ME.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
Yeah, SHE WAS HERE.
but SHE'S GONE.
Where'd SHE GO? - I DON'T KNOW.
when YOU GOT ARRESTED, SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO POST YOUR BAIL.
she SAID SHE WENT TO SEE YOU.
she DIDN'T. - I KNOW.
that's WHAT SHE TOLD ME.
and I WANTED TO HELP, SO I WROTE HER A CHECK,
which SHE CASHED.
as FAR AS I KNOW, NO ONE'S HEARD FROM HER SINCE.
so YOU WANTED TO BAIL ME OUT?
Yeah.
thank YOU.
well, THAT'S GONNA BE TOUGH TO EXPLAIN.
you KNOW, I...I THINK I'M FINALLY READY TO SAY
that SEAN CONNERY IS MY FAVORITE BOND.
I've BEEN FLIP FLOPPING ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE NOW,
but LAST NIGHT CONFIRMED IT.
I LIKE HUGH JACKMAN.
he NEVER PLAYED BOND.
I'm JUST SAYING THAT I LIKE HIM.
Oh, MY GOD! YOU ARE ON ...?
Oh, OH MY GOD!
we ARE!
rose, COME HERE.
what?
Oh, MY GOD, THAT'S A GOOD PICTURE.
I HAVE TO CALL PATRICIA.
wait, IS THAT MAX?
Yeah, HE WAS THERE.
did YOU GUYS HOOK UP?
no. OF COURSE NOT.
I'm JUST ASKING. GOD.
damn, HE LOOKS GOOD.
uh, I GOTTA GET TO CLASS.
you're KIDDING.
Heh. THAT'S AMAZING.
rose, SHE'S ALREADY SCORED 3 INVITES FOR US SINCE THIS PICTURE'S BEEN POSTED.
that's GREAT. - YEAH.
Yeah. UH-HUH.
that's FANTASTIC.
Marco, WE NEED TO ADJUST THE MENU FOR THIS EVENING.
I FORGOT THAT MRS. GOULD-- - DOESN'T EAT MEAT?
Yes. - I REMEMBER FROM THE LAST TIME.
I WENT TO THE MARKET THIS MORNING AND GOT YELLOW FIN TUNA.
I BELIEVE IT'S HER FAVORITE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT YOU.
but THEN I SUPPOSE I BETTER GET USED TO THE IDEA.
I READ YOUR RESEARCH AND PASSED IT ON TO MY BUSINESS MANAGER.
he THINKS IT'LL BE A VERY SOUND INVESTMENT FOR ME.
and SO DO I.
Congratulations.
thank YOU, LAUREL. YOUR SUPPORT MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO ME.
laurel IS GIVING ME THE MONEY!
what? OH, MY GOD, THAT'S AMAZING!
I KNOW! I KNOW! I KNOW! I KNOW!
what FOR?
OK. WELL, I TOOK YOUR ADVICE AND DECIDED TO GET POSITIVELY PROACTIVE.
I'm FINALLY OPENING MY RESTAURANT!
you ARE?!
Oh, MY GOD!
OK, NO MORE JUMPING.
OK, NO MORE JUMPING. NO MORE JUMPING.
what IS GOING ON HERE? I'M LOVING THAT DRESS.
Really? THIS IS THE FOURTH ONE THAT I'VE TRIED ON.
I'm MEETING WILL'S PARENTS TONIGHT AND I WANT TO LOOK RESPECTABLE.
and CUTE. AND HOT. SO RESPECTABLY HOT-CUTE.
Oh, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, HONEY. THEY'RE GONNA LOVE YOU.
OK, SO TELL ME EVERYTHING THAT LAUREL SAID.
I WANT TO HEAR THE PLAN.
all RIGHT.
hold ON ONE SECOND.
what's UP, LILY?
you HAVE TO COME TO DAD'S RIGHT NOW.
he's GOING COMPLETELY PSYCHO.
no, I CAN'T. I'M GOING OVER TO WILL'S HOUSE FOR DINNER TONIGHT.
this IS SERIOUS, MEGAN.
I THINK HE'S GONE OF THE DEEP END.
I NEED YOU.
let ME GUESS. EMERGENCY AT THE SMITH RESIDENCE?
she IS FREAKING OUT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
you KNOW WHAT, IF I LEAVE NOW, I CAN MAKE IT.
I'll JUST CALL WILL AND I'LL TELL HIM I'LL BE A LITTLE BIT LATE.
you're GONNA BE LATE FOR YOUR FIRST DINNER WITH WILL'S PARENTS?
don't GIVE ME THE FACE. I CANNOT HANDLE THE FACE RIGHT NOW.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA LET YOUR FAMILY GO AT IT ALONE FOR A WHILE.
that WAS THE PLAN. - I LIKE THAT PLAN.
me, TOO. THE PLAN WAS VERY FREEING.
I FELT LIKE A LITTLE BIRD. - BE THE BIRD.
fly TO YOUR BOYFRIEND'S HOUSE
and MEET HIS PARENTS, AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.
your FAMILY DRAMA WILL STILL BE THERE IN THE MORNING.
or MAYBE THEY WILL FIGURE IT OUT FOR THEMSELVES.
the WHOLE GOAL OF THE BIRD PLAN
was THAT THEY BECOME STRONG AND INDEPENDENT
so THAT I COULD REJOIN THE NEST AT SOME POINT, WHEN IT'S SAFE.
that WAY I DON'T HAVE TO SIT ON THE EGGS ALL THE TIME
and MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T CRACK
or DRINK OR WIND BACK UP IN JAIL.
your METAPHOR JUST GOT A LITTLE TOO ELABORATE.
now, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'm GOING TO RUB MY GOOD NEWS IN RAMI'S FACE.
I've GOT 10 MINUTES. TALK TO ME
you LOOK NICE, HONEY. YOU GOING OUT TONIGHT?
I ORDERED PIZZA.
you SAID THIS WAS AN EMERGENCY.
there IS NO EMERGENCY.
he WANTS TO SELL HIS BOAT,
his ONLY SOURCE OF INCOME,
to PAY WILL BACK THE 25, 000 MOM STOLE.
ask HIM HOW HE'S GOING TO PAY HIS RENT.
he WANTS TO GO ON UNEMPLOYMENT.
dad, YOU CAN'T GO ON UNEMPLOYMENT.
damn STRAIGHT HE CAN'T.
I'm NOT GOING THROUGH THAT CRAP AGAIN.
I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER YOU GOING THROUGH IT WITH US THE FIRST TIME.
but SHE'S RIGHT, IT'S A BAD IDEA.
I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER WAY.
it's OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A FAMILY TO PAY WILL BACK THE MONEY.
like HELL. YOU THINK I'M PAYING OFF MOM'S DEBT?
she STOLE MY BAIL MONEY. - YEAH, WHICH YOU DIDN'T WIND UP NEEDING.
she DIDN'T KNOW THAT. - OK, EVERYONE, CALM DOWN.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW INSENSITIVE YOU GIRLS ARE BEING.
not JUST TO WILL, BUT TO YOUR MOTHER.
excuse ME? - YOU DON'T KNOW WHY SHE TOOK THE MONEY.
maybe SHE'S IN TROUBLE.
I MEAN, SHE'S OBVIOUSLY FEELING DESPERATE.
you're OUT OF YOUR MIND. - OH, MY GOD.
I'm NOT SAYING SHE DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE.
dad, I NEED YOU TO NOT GO DOWN THIS ROAD RIGHT NOW.
mom IS NOT IN TROUBLE.
she's A USER. SHE CONNED US,
and SHE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF WILL.
that IS WHAT HAPPENED,
so DEAL WITH IT.
you DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE.
that's ALL I'M SAYING. - UNBELIEVABLE.
I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.
where ARE YOU GOING? - I TOLD YOU.
I'm MEETING WILL'S FAMILY TONIGHT.
I HAVE TO GO.
we're YOUR FAMILY.
us.
that--that HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT
I MADE A COMMITMENT.
Lily, LET HER GO.
I MEAN, IF YOUR SISTER WANTS TO LEAVE
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE,
I HAVE TO.
don't MAKE ME FEEL BAD ABOUT THIS.
I'm NOT TRYING TO. I'M SAYING IF YOU WANT TO GO, GO.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING TO WALK OUT AT A TIME LIKE THIS.
it's ALWAYS A TIME LIKE THIS.
Hey. - I AM SO SORRY.
no, DON'T WORRY. I TOLD THEM THAT
you WERE STILL WORKING WITH THE GIRLS.
what HAPPENED?
well, LILY CALLED.
did SHE TELL YOU ABOUT LAST NIGHT?
no. WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?
I TRIED TO CALL YOU BUT YOUR PHONE WAS OFF,
so I JUST FIGURED IT BE BEST EXPLAIN IN PERSON.
what HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?
well, LILY SHOWED UP HERE
and SHE WAS ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR MOM,
which I ANSWERED. AND THEN...
she KIND OF KISSED ME.
she KIND OF KISSED YOU?
I MEAN, IT WASN'T THAT KIND OF KISS.
it WAS...MORE LIKE A KISS OF GRATITUDE LIKE IN THE GODFATHER.
a MAFIA KISS?
sort OF.
you REALLY HAD TO BE THERE.
Oh, YEAH, I'M REALLY SORRY I MISSED THAT.
OK, UM, BUT OBVIOUSLY
something ELSE HAPPENED BECAUSE YOU'RE FREAKED OUT.
it's TOO MUCH TO TELL YOU ABOUT NOW.
and I DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOUR PARENTS WAITING ANY LONGER,
so I'LL TELL YOU LATER.
OK, BUT ARE YOU UPSET ABOUT THE KISS?
later.
so TOMORROW IS THE BENEFIT AT WHITEHALL.
do WE REALLY NEED TO GO TO THAT ONE?
OK, SO WHAT--WHAT TIME IS THAT AT?
why SO EARLY?
how EARLY? - 1: 00.
cause WE CAN'T MISS THE RED CARPET PART. RIGHT, RIGHT.
OK, SO WHERE DO WE HAVE TO BE?
perfect.
Yeah.
it's LUIS.
Patricia, CAN I CALL YOU...
Yeah.
look, I'VE GOT TO GET THE LIVING ROOM READY FOR ZACH.
is THAT OK? - YEAH. GOOD LUCK.
Yeah, YEAH, RIGHT. OK.
um, YEAH, THAT SOUNDS-- THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
Yeah, THAT-- THAT SOUNDS-- THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
OK.
Josephine, THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST CHICKEN MARSALA I'VE EVER HAD.
Really? OH, I'M SO GLAD.
the COOK WAS GONNA DO IT, BUT I THOUGHT I'D GIVE IT A ...?
you HAVE NO IDEA HOW LUCKY YOU ARE.
she NEVER COOKS FOR ME.
me, NEITHER.
stop IT, YOU TWO.
they ARE ALWAYS GANGING UP ON ME.
not ALWAYS. - MOST OF THE TIME.
you OK? - MM-HMM.
so AT SOME POINT,
I WANT TO DISCUSS YOUR IDEAS FOR THE MAGAZINE.
I LOVED YOUR ANGLE ON IT. DIDN'T YOU, WILL?
told YOU, SHE'S A GENIUS.
you're NOT SO BAD YOURSELF, KIDDO.
did YOU SHOW MEGAN THOSE PHOTOS YOU TOOK AT THE RACES LAST WEEK?
no, NOT YET.
it's BEEN A LITTLE CRAZY.
Oh, THEY'RE FANTASTIC.
I THINK YOU COULD EASILY GET THOSE PUBLISHED.
Really? - YEAH, I REALLY DO.
i--it's THE WORK-- - UH, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.
I JUST HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
I MEAN, WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT NOW
is THAT YOU'RE REALLY DEVELOPING A POINT OF VIEW. AND...
Oh, I AGREE.
OK, SO BEFORE WE START WITH THE MOVIE,
I HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU.
open IT.
they're FOR YOUR COLLECTION.
um, DRIVER DAVE HAD TO TAKE ME TO LIKE 3 DIFFERENT STORES TO FIND THEM.
Oh, WOW. THANKS.
you're STILL UPSET ABOUT THE PICTURE FROM THE PARTY?
no.
I DON'T KNOW, A LITTLE.
well, YOU DON'T THINK SOMETHING ACTUALLY HAPPENED WITH MAX, DO YOU?
no. - THEN WHY ARE YOU STILL SO MAD?
obviously IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
I KNOW, BUT IT'S STILL NOT THAT FUN
seeing YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S EX-BOYFRIEND HANGING ALL OVER HER.
he WASN'T HANGING ALL OVER ME.
look, THE POINT IS,
I KNOW YOU AND MAX USED TO GO TO THESE KIND OF THINGS ALL THE TIME.
and IT'S JUST NOT-- - WELL, NOT REALLY.
I MEAN, YEAH,
we USED TO PARTY TOGETHER A LOT, BUT
but I DON'T LIKE PARTY.
I DON'T EVEN LIKE TO USE THE WORD "PARTY" AS A VERB.
and YOU AND SAGE ARE GONNA KEEP GETTING INVITED
to THESE EVENTS OR WHATEVER, AND I'M JUST GONNA KEEP
well, SO, I'LL JUST ASK PATRICIA IF SHE CAN GET ME A PLUS ONE.
I MEAN, IF SHE CAN.
no, I DON'T WANT TO GO, OK.
I HATE THOSE KIND OF THINGS.
I JUST DON'T FIT IN THERE.
me NEITHER.
but I HAVE TO GO.
but WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO?
because I PROMISED SAGE.
and THIS IS A REALLY BIG DEAL FOR HER,
and I CAN'T JUST BACK OUT NOW.
and DO NOT MAKE ME CHOOSE BETWEEN YOU GUYS BECAUSE
I'd LOSE.
she's MY FAMILY.
I KNOW.
you're LEAVING?
I'm JUST NOT REALLY IN THE MOOD TO WATCH A MOVIE RIGHT NOW.
but, UH, I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW, OK?
Oh, AND...
thanks AGAIN.
I HEARD THIS PLACE WAS GOING ON THE MARKET SOON.
that's RIGHT. THE OWNER IS SELLING.
but WHY? IT'S ALWAYS SO PACKED.
is THERE SOMETHING I'M MISSING?
lony OF RATS LIVING DOWNSTAIRS?
Gino IS JUST GETTING OLDER
and HIS SON DECIDED HE DIDN'T WANT THE PLACE.
can I GET YOU A DRINK?
sure.
let's SEE WHAT KIND OF GIN YOU'VE GOT.
Oh, MY GOD.
is EVERYTHING OK?
I'm SORRY.
I've GOT TO GO.
you OK IN THERE?
this IS A REALLY PRETTY BATHROOM.
it's THE FLUIEST TOWELS EVER.
talk TO ME.
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT THE KISS.
no, I'M NOT.
well, I AM, BUT ...
not BECAUSE I'M JEALOUS.
but JUST, YOU KNOW,
it's JUST ANOTHER REMINDER OF HOW MESSED UP MY FAMILY IS.
I MEAN, MY SISTER KISSES MY BOYFRIEND.
my DAD SIDES WITH MY MOM OVER ME AGAIN.
wait, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
what HAPPENED AT YOUR DAD'S TONIGHT?
nothing. YOU KNOW, JUST
a BUMING...? AND FIGHTING AND
Oh, WAIT, HE'S OBSESSED WITH PAYING YOU BACK THE $25, 000.
well, YOU TOLD HIM I WON'T TAKE IT, RIGHT?
numerous TIMES.
so MAYBE I SHOULD TALK TO HIM.
God, NO. ARE YOU CRAZY?
OK. - WILL,
you're STILL NOT GETTING THIS.
the FACT THAT YOU WENT BEHIND MY BACK
and TALKED TO MY MOTHER
is THE WHOLE REASON THAT WE ARE IN THIS MESS RIGHT NOW.
no OFFENSE.
how COULD I TAKE OFFENSE?
you're JUST BLAMING ME FOR ALL OF IT.
no, I'M NOT BLAMING YOU.
look...
I WISH THAT I COULD EXPLAIN TO YOU
why YOUR LOGICAL APPROACH TO DEALING WITH THINGS
does NOT WORK FOR MY FAMILY, BUT I CAN'T.
and IT'S NOT FAIR FOR ME TO EXPECT YOU TO UNDERSTAND.
what IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
it's NOT A BAD THING.
will, YOU LIVE IN THIS LOVELY WORLD
with THESE, LIKE, PERFECT PARENTS
and FANCY SOAPS THAT ARE SHAPED LIKE POOTLES.
I MEAN, WILL, IT DOESN'T GET CUTER.
I WANT TO BE THERE FOR YOU.
tell ME WHAT I CAN DO.
that's THE THING.
you CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
and EVERY TIME YOU TRY, IT JUST MAKES THINGS WORSE,
and THEN I END UP FEELING GUILTY.
you SHOULDN'T. - BUT I DO.
I FEEL GUILTY FOR GETTING YOU INVOLVED,
and THEN I FEEL GUILTY FOR LEAVING THEM AND...
look,
I KNOW YOU WANT ME TO SEPARATE MYSELF FROM MY FAMILY,
but I CAN'T.
I DID THAT FOR 5 YEARS,
and I WOUND UP BACK HERE.
this IS MY FAMILY, FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE,
and I CAN'T ESCAPE IT.
and I JUST...
I CAN'T KEEP DRAGGING YOU INTO THIS.
wait, MEGAN.
will YOU PLEASE SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR FAMILY FOR ME?
wait, YOU'RE LEAVING?
I JUST--I HAVE TO GET BACK TO MY DAD.
I LEFT THEM IN A REALLY BAD WAY, AND...
I'm SORRY, WILL.
OK, READY TO HELP CURE CANCER.
I THINK THIS LUNCHEON'S FOR THE CHILDREN'S MUSEUM.
Oh, WELL, I'M NOT GONNA WEAR THESE EARRINGS, THEN.
OK, HOW DO I LOOK?
gorgeous. AND ME?
stunning.
wow, YOU GIRLS LOOK SMOKIN'.
and MISERABLE.
what's GOING ON?
we're JUST TIRED.
we REALLY WANTED TO SLEEP IN TODAY.
well, YOU'VE HAD A BUSY WEEK.
where YOU GOING?
a PARTY.
sounds AWFUL.
well, IT'S NOT A PARTY PARTY.
it's A WORK PARTY.
and, WELL, THERE'S ONE TOMORROW, TOO.
and THAT BASICALLY SUCKS UP OUR WHOLE WEEKEND.
Yeah, AND LUIS COMES HOME TONIGHT,
so THAT S I CAN'T PICK HIM UP FROM THE AIRPORT LIKE I WANTED TO.
and ZACH HATES ME BECAUSE I USED THE WORD "PARTY" AS A VERB.
OK, WELL, HERE'S A CRAZY IDEA.
why DON'T YOU GIRLS SKIP THE PARTIES THIS WEEKEND
and HANG OUT WITH YOUR BOYS?
well, WE ALREADY TOLD PATRICIA WE'D GO.
and THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF THING WE WANTED HER TO MAKE HAPPEN.
and NOW IT'S HAPPENING.
and I PAY HER A LOT OF MONEY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.
that's TRUE.
so WHAT IF YOU STOPPED PAYING HER?
well, THEN SHE PROBABLY WOULD STOP WORKING FOR US.
hello. - RIGHT.
just--I DON'T KNOW,
it SEEMS TO ME THAT WHEN YOU HIRED PATRICIA,
your LIVES WERE REALLY DIFFERENT.
your NUMBER ONE PRIORITY
was TO GO TO ALL THESE FABULOUS PARTIES
and TO GET, WELL,
for LACK OF A BETTER WORD, FAMOUS.
no, THAT'S THE WORD.
and NOW YOU HAVE NEW PRIORITIES, LIKE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS.
I MEAN, YOU MET 2 GUYS THAT REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU A LOT.
wouldn't YOU RATHER HANG OUT WITH THEM THAN A BUNCH OF STRANGERS?
so YOU'RE ASKING US TO THROW AWAY OUR CAREERS FOR SOME GUYS?
nice FEMINISTS PRINCIPLES.
exactly WHAT CAREER WOULD YOU BE THROWING AWAY?
I MEAN, ALL YOU'VE BEEN DOING IS GOING TO PARTIES
and GETTING YOUR PICTURE TAKEN.
and I'M NOT SAYING IT'S NOT FUN TO BE FAMOUS,
and IF THAT'S STILL WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,
then GO FOR IT, BUT ...
if IT'S NOT MAKING YOU HAPPY,
then WHAT'S THE POINT?
OK, LOOK, WE'LL GO OVER YOUR CHEM LABS TOMORROW NIGHT.
but JUST HAVE FUN TODAY,
whatever IT IS THAT YOU DECIDE TO DO.
look, IF YOU WANT TO GO, I'LL GO.
do YOU WANT TO GO?
sage, I--I'VE ONLY EVER BEEN DOING THIS FOR YOU.
and, WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH REASON FOR ME,
but IF YOU'RE ASKING WHAT I'D RATHER
I KNOW, I KNOW.
you WANTED TO SEE ME?
Yes. YES, COME IN.
so HOW DID GO AT THE RESTURANT LAST NIGHT?
you STILL LIKE THE SPACE?
it's A GREAT LOCATION.
everything ABOUT IT IS PRETTY MUCH PERFECT.
good.
I THINK WE SHOULD OFFER A DOWN PAYMENT TODAY.
you NEED MORE?
no, NO. THIS IS MORE THAN ENOUGH.
but I CAN'T ACCEPT IT.
I THOUGHT THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED.
well, I THOUGHT SO, TOO.
it TURNS OUT I WAS WRONG.
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS WITHOUT KEITH.
we BROKE UP, AND I THOUGHT I NEEDED TO MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE.
but THE TRUTH IS,
he IS MY LIFE.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MUST THINK OF ME.
what DO I THINK?
that I'M WEAK.
I MEAN, YOU DID ALL OF THIS ON YOUR OWN
you BUILT A WHOLE EMPIRE,
and I CAN'T EVEN OPEN A TINY RESTAURANT WITHOUT MY BOYFRIEND.
I WOULDN'T BE DOING ANY OF THIS
if I DIDN'T FEEL IT KEPT ME CONNECTED TO ROBERT.
I UNDERSTAND MORE THAN YOU REALIZE.
no, KEEP IT.
put IT IN A SAFE PLACE.
it's YOURS WHEN YOU'RE READY.
I'm REALLY TIRED.
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER FIGHT.
no, ME NEITHER.
look, I JUST-- I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING,
and THEN I PROMISE I'LL LEAVE.
Lily, I'M SORRY FOR NOT BEING A BETTER SISTER TO YOU.
I'm SORRY THAT
I MOVED AWAY TO NEW YORK
and DIDN'T WORK HARDER AT KEEPING IN TOUCH. AND...
most OF ALL,
I'm SO SORRY THAT YOU NEVER GOT TO SEE MOM.
I JUST WANTED TO SEE HER, YOU KNOW.
hear WHAT HER VOICE SOUNDS LIKE.
I HAVE THIS VAGUE MEMORY OF HER FROM WHEN I WAS LITTLE.
and I TRY TO IMAGINE WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE NOW.
want TO SEE A PICTURE?
Seriously?
Oh, MY GOD.
she's SO PRETTY.
Yeah, I KNOW.
she LOOKS LIKE YOU.
Seriously?
no, I THOUGHT SHE LOOKED LIKE YOU.
I MEAN LOOK AT THAT SMILE.
Yeah.
I SEE THAT.
here YOUR FRIENDS BACK.
I DON'T NEED THEM ANYMORE.
Oh, THAT'S RIGHT.
now THAT YOU'RE A BIG-TIME RESTAURANTEUR, YOU'RE A BUSY MAN.
Oh, BY THE WAY, I HAVE SOME NAME IDEAS FOR THE RESTAURANT.
save THEM. THE RESTAURANT PLAN IS ON HOLD INDEFINITELY.
why, WHAT HAPPENED?
I HAVE SOME THINGS I NEED TO DO FIRST.
and I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.
anything.
good. CLEAR YOUR SCHEDULE.
tomorrow MORNING IS DAY ONE OPERATION GET KEITH BACK.
I'm IN!
Ooh.
any CHANCE THAT THERE MIGHT BE
some CHOCOLATE CHIP PANCAKES AT THIS MEETING?
I'm JUST SAYING.
helps ME THINK.
whatever YOU NEED.
I'll SEE YOU BRIGHT AND EARLY.
now I WANT SOME CHOCOLATE CHIPS.
no, IT'S--IT'S NOT THAT.
we've APPRECIATED EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE FOR US. AND...
Yeah.
no, IT'S JUST-- YOU KNOW, ROSE AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING
and...
we JUST THINK THAT THIS IS ...
the BEST WAY TO GO.
I KNOW, PATRICIA. I
thank YOU.
wow, DID YOU JUST FIRE PATRICIA?
Yeah. AND IT WAS REALLY HARD.
I BET.
why ISN'T ROSE HERE?
she AND ZACH ARE AT THE BEACH MAKING UP.
it's OK.
this WHOLE THING WAS REALLY MY IDEA TO BEGIN WITH.
well, FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH,
I THINK YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.
Yeah, THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
why I DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
right. BUT I'M OLD-SCHOOL.
cause I THINK BEING FAMOUS SHOULD BE A RESULT OF DOING SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE, NOT THE GOAL.
not THAT YOU'RE JUDGING
or ANYTHING.
anyway, I KNOW THAT.
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BE FAMOUS THE REGULAR WAY.
I JUST KNEW THAT I NEEDED IT TO HAPPEN, SO
why DID YOU NEED IT TO HAPPEN?
so THAT I COULD TAKE CARE OF ROSE AND I
the WAY THAT WE'VE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO.
um, I THINK YOU'RE COVERED.
this IS LAUREL'S MONEY.
OK, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF US ON MY OWN.
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO RELY ON ANYONE FOR ANYTHING.
and NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
sage, WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
my BIGGEST CONCERN WAS TRYING TO GET ETHAN HAWKE TO MARRY ME.
the REALITY BITES ETHAN HAWKE,
not THE "I LEFT MY WIFE FOR THE NANNY
and HAVEN'T SHOWERED IN 10 DAYS" ETHAN HAWKE.
anyway, THE POINT IS, IS THAT YOU HAVE A LONG TIME
to FIGURE THIS STUFF OUT.
I'm GOING TO BE 17 IN 2 MONTHS.
moley CYRUS WAS 9 YEARS OLD WHEN SHE FIRST STARTED.
and SHE ALREADY LOOKS OLDER THAN ME.
no OFFENSE, MILEY.
you HAVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE TO BE A GROWNUP, SAGE.
you DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME LEFT TO JUST ENJOY BEING A KID.
we're WAY PAST SANDCASTLES, SWEETIE.
true. BUT YOU COULD JUST HANG OUT WITH YOUR HOT NEW BOYFRIEND
and COAST FOR A WHILE.
hmm.
if I LEAVE NOW,
I CAN STILL MAKE IT TO THE AIRPORT AND PICK HIM UP.
go DO IT.
want SOME CHOCOLATE CHIPS FOR THE ROAD?
empty CALORIES.
it's $200.
I've WORKED OUT A PAYMENT PLAN AND...
I'm GOING TO PAY YOU $200 A MONTH
until I'D COMPLETELY PAID OFF MY MOTHER'S DEBT.
which, BY MY CALCULATIONS,
will BE ROUGHLY AROUND MY 68th BIRTHDAY.
actually, IT'LL BE CLOSER TO YOUR 34th.
what, THEY DIDN'T TEACH YOU MATH AT YALE?
did YOU JUST DO THAT IN YOUR HEAD?
this IS NOT YOUR DEBT.
I'm THE ONE WHO DECIDED TO GIVE SHELBY THE MONEY.
it's MY RESPONSIBILITY.
this IS JUST LIKE A BAD INVESTMENT.
you HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH MONEY I'VE LOST IN BAD INVESTMENTS?
$76, 000? - MEGAN.
$92, 000?
you DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO GUESS.
the POINT IS,
it's MY MISTAKE.
you AND YOUR FAMILY OWE ME NOTHING.
no, I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.
sorry I LEFT LIKE THAT LAST NIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST-- I GOT SO ANXIOUS.
every TIME YOUR DAD REFILLED BY WINE GLASS,
it MADE ME THINK ABOUT MY DAD.
Oh, MAN, I...
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT. - OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.
because A NORMAL PERSON DOESN'T LOOK AT A GLASS OF WINE LIKE IT COULD KILL THEIR FATHER.
I'm SORRY THAT I TOLD YOU TO DITCH YOUR FAMILY.
the WOMAN THAT I FEEL IN LOVE WITH
could NEVER GIVE UP ON ANYBODY.
did YOU JUST... - THAT'S RIGHT.
I LOVE YOU, MEGAN SMITH.
deal WITH THAT.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
I have doubts about your present proposal

there are only four types of persons in Hongkon.
I don't qualify to be the rich.
I don't want to be the poor.

but I can improve something today.
what?
it's really have universal gravitation in our world - Arrest all of them. - Yes sir.
there's no need to be worried Those junks are harmless.
there is pirate on this water so you've got to be on your guard.
the Rear-Admiral was coming to get the pirates.
the pirates have got him instead.
what shall we do now?
we'd better blockade the waters.
no sea traffic will be allowed.
you can't do that.Are you trying to bankrupt us?
if you blocked the waters for 3 months,
you may not be able to get Lo.
but you would sure kill our business.
are there any better solutions?.
the pirates have captured the Rear-Admiral.
he is our first priority.
I'll have to go home if I can't save the Rear-Admiral.
Where's home?.
spare me your funny remarks.
come up with some good plans.
sit down, Mr. Chou.
sure.
excuse me,
I have to see someone,excuse me.
what the pirates want is money.
we can pay the ransom, but we need a go-between.
the pirates have never touched your ships.
you're the ideal go-between.
do you know what I mean?.
I've always wanted to work for the Queen.
but some of my men were arrested recently.
no problem.I can set them free right away.
I always envy people who got knighted.
I can pull some strings for you.
Thanks. Cheers.
Cheers.
in order that our ships sail safely.
my men do have unofficial contacts with the pirates.
but this time I'll have to go myself.
I need 100 rifles to give Lo as presents.
I'll have to think about that if we could save Rear-Admiral.
let me know your decision.
Goodbye,I go first.
you'll hear from me promptly,bye.
see you then
goodbye
goodbye
who are you?
I'm the coast guard Sergeant Ma .
I used to belong to the coast guards.
what are you doing here?
the Rear-Admiral was captured.I thought the coast guard could be together again.
I hope I come for some good news.
yet I eavesdropped on a dirty deal.
you don't know the whole.The safety of the Rear-Admiral gets first priority,
you're more concerned with your career.
many were captured in the past.
have you ever paid ransom to save them?
shut up.
you shut up.
the money you're going to use as ransom is from captain Shi by hardwork.
were donated by the public in Hong Kong to fight pirates.
you're abusing it for selfish reasons.
and you call yourself a civil servant?
you're a law enforcer,
you don't arrest the pirates' accomplice,
instead you're going to get him knighted,and ask him to connect with pirates.
is that what the Queen pays you to do?
you know Lo is a cold-blooded killer,and you still give them money.
do you get it if once he's got these rifles.
how many more innocent men will be killed?
you spend your time on antiques.
do you know how many women has widowed?And how many children he has orphaned?
do you hope they become the "expecting stone?"
of course I want to destroy the pirates.
I've never surrendered before.
but The Royal Navy don't even have a fleet.
how am I going to fight the pirates?
one should use wisdom to save the country.
there must be a way to beat Lo by our wisdom and power.
and save the Rear-Admiral.
do you have a plan?
no.
no?
let's think together.You think it is impossible so soon.
I have nothing to say.
you're now in charge of the rescue mission.
Ok,I'll come up with a plan.
go do it.
Yes, sir.
be careful - Thanks for the donations - Goodbye.

I heard these rifles were hard to get.
I'm sorry.Just because of our careless.
li got arrested.

San,you're a man of humor.
you hijacked an English ship the other day.

and THAT'S BECAUSE FOR YOUR NEXT CHALLENGE,
you WILL BE CREATING AN AVANT-GARDE LOOK INSPIRED BY YOUR MODEL'S HAIRSTYLE.
the CHALLENGE REALLY JUST COULDN'T BE BETTER.
this IS THE CHALLENGE THAT I'M THE MOST EXCITED ABOUT.
this IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO PUSH YOURSELVES AS DESIGNERS,
and TO CREATE SOMETHING ARTISTIC AND CONCEPTUAL
models,
because YOU WEREN'T USED IN THE LAST CHALLENGE,
there ARE TEN OF YOU AND EIGHT DESIGNERS.
so TWO OF YOU WILL BE OUT.
you WON THE LAST CHALLENGE.
so YOU GET THE FIRST PICK.
I WOULD LOVE TO STICK WITH JACQUELINE.
kit. OKAY, GOOD. MARIE.
this IS TOUGH BECAUSE OF THE HAIRDOS.
I'm SORRY, I WANT TO PICK LEA.

Bye.
Bye.
designers, AS HEIDI SAID,
for THIS CHALLENGE YOU'LL BE CREATING AN AVANT-GARDE LOOK INSPIRED BY YOUR MODEL'S HAIRSTYLE.
this LOOK DOES NOT HAVE TO BE PRACTICAL.
it DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE VERY WEARABLE.
an AVANT-GARDE LOOK IS BY DEFINITION AMBITIOUS.
because OF THAT,
you WILL BE WORKING IN TEAMS OF TWO.
of COURSE.
I WILL DRAW YOUR NAMES FROM THIS BAG TO DETERMINE THE TEAMS.
so TEAM ONE IS...
and...
team TWO...
with RAMI.
Oh, THAT'S FANTASTIC.
team THREE...
with...
I WAS LIKE, "ALL HE DOES IS COSTUME AND CRAZY [bleep].
he's GONNA COME UP WITH SOMETHING FABULOUS.
who's LEFT?
and JILLIAN.
all RIGHT? YOU'LL HAVE 30 MINUTES TO DETERMINE WHICH MODEL'S HAIRSTYLE
will INSPIRE THE LOOK FOR THIS CHALLENGE.
your BUDGET IS $300.

each TEAM MUST CHOOSE A TEAM LEADER.
I'm GONNA SEND IN YOUR MODELS.
use YOUR TIME WELL.

I'm SO SCARED.
I'm GONNA GET ELIMINATED.
honey, IT HAPPENED TO ME.
I REALLY DON'T WANNA BE LEADER BECAUSE I DON'T WANNA BE ELIMINATED.

I THINK HERS IS MORE GLAMOROUS.
use HER THEN. GO AHEAD.
we CHOSE MARCIA.
she's VERY TALL AND GORGEOUS.
what IF WE DID THE ENTIRE DRESS IN CIRCLES OF ORGANZA?
thousands. THOUSANDS.
we're GONNA DO THIS IN THE MOST DIPLOMATIC WAY. SO I'M SORRY
your HAIR IS MORE EASY TO WORK WITH.
sorry, GIRL. HAVE A SEAT.
Marie's HAIR LOOKS LIKE A BIRD NES.
so WE DECIDED TO USE MY MODEL, MARIE.
our WHOLE CONCEPT IS BASED OFF THIS IDEA OF NESTING.
in MY HEAD, THESE ARE ALL TOTALLY DIFFERENT FABRICS.
that LOOK GOOD TOGETHER. THAT COULD BE COOL TOO. I LIKE THAT IDEA.
it JUST WORKED OUT NATURALLY THAT I WOULD BE THE TEAM LEADER,
because IT'S BASICALLY MY CONCEPT.
fantastic.
rami AND I DECIDED WE WILL PICK SAM AS OUR MODEL.
he IS THE LEADER.
because MY MIND DOESN'T REALLY NATURALLY GO TO THE AVANT-GARDE.
the CHIFFON IS RESTRICTED IN ONE AREA OF THE BODICE
and THEN JUST PRETTY MUCH FREELY FALLS OUT INTO A GOWN OF SOME SORT.
the VISION FOR THIS AVANT-GARDE PIECE IS HARD AND SOFT.
I'm USING THAT CONCEPT TO CREATE CURVY LINES AND THEN FREELY FALLING OUT, JUST LIKE HER HAIR.
so WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
so I THOUGHT ABOUT, LIKE, KIND OF AN APOCALYPTIC, DRAMATIC TRENCH COAT.
actually, WHEN I SAW JACQUELINE, I KNOW THAT SHE DEFINITELY HAS A VERY HEAVY,
LIKE,'80S PUNK REFERENCE.
there WAS NOT GONNA BE A CHANCE IN HELL
that EITHER OF US WERE GONNA SAY, "OKAY, YOU BE THE LEADER.
it WAS NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST FLIP A COIN. UNLESS WE FLIP THIS,
and IF IT LANDS FACE UP, IT'S MINE
okay, THAT'S GOOD. S IT CLOSED? OK. FACE DOWN, IT'S YOURS.
it's YOURS. OKAY.
are YOU COOL WITH THAT?
I AM A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS.
I THINK WE NEED TO JUST REALLY SOLIDIFY A STORY HERE.
right, OKAY.
designers,
time's UP.
we're GOING SHOPPING.
we HAVE $300 FOR THIS CHALLENGE.
Ooh, LOOK AT THIS ONE AND THAT.
we ARE GETTING DIFFERENT FABRICS THAT WORK WITH THE COLORS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.
Oh, MY GOD, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
RAMI?
RAMI?
is THERE ENOUGH?
Yeah, THERE'S TWO ROLLS.
that's NOT 40 YARDS.
we NEED SO MUCH FABRIC.
we NEED PROBABLY 50 YARDS OF ORGANZA.
Oh, THIS IS BETTER.
this IS WAY BETTER.THIS IS GONNA BE PERFECT.
thank YOU, MOOD!
Oh, WOW, WE HAVE A LOT.
I DON'T WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE.
our AVANT-GARDE LOOK STARTED WITH THE IDEA OF THE HAIR BEING A BIRD'S NEST.
so WE DID A THEME OF A GIRL WHO'D BE IN A GARDEN
and MANY APRONS TO REPRESENT LAYERING.
this IS SOME SERIOUS DRAMA.
like, IT'S THE GIRL IN ME, AND IT'S THE BITCH IN YOU.
it's THE BOTTOM.
FEROSH.
if I WAS A DIVA,
my NAME WOULD BE FEROSH.
Marcia HAS THIS HUGE, KIND OF ROMANTIC BRAIDED BUN.
and SO THE GOWN IS LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF LAYERS
of TIERED, CIRCULAR RUFFLES.
and WE'LL HAVE THIS GIANT NECKPIECE,
and OH, MY GOD, IT'S AMAZING.
I'm TRYING TO BUILD US A CELL PHONE TOWERSO WE CAN CALL OUT.
how ABOUT IF IT TAKES US TO ELISA'S PLANET?
didn't YOU KNOW, ELISA LEFT ME THESE INSTRUCTIONS.
the MODEL'S. AND JUST KIND OF TIP IT OVER HERE.
Yeah, AWESOME.
the MODEL'S HAIR GIVES THE EFFECT OF A MOHAWK.
so IT ALLOWED US TO COME UP WITH THIS THEME OF, LIKE, REBELLION.
and I'M KIND OF REPLICATING THE HAIRSTYLE DOWN THE BACK.
of THE TRENCH COAT THAT I'M MAKING.
VICTORYA'S WORKING ON THE SHIRT AND THE PANTS.
two DAYS IS NEVER ENOUGH TIME FOR ANYTHING FOR ME.
and VICTORYA AND I ARE BOTH PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE WITH TIME MANAGEMENT.
so I'M PRETTY WORRIED ABOUT IT.
so WHY DON'T YOU PUT IT ON THE DRESS FORM
and TRY TO PUT A FRENCH SEAM IN THE CENTER FRONT, OKAY?
I CHOSE TO TAKE OVER THE CORSET AND SORT OF THE GOWN PART OF THE OUTFIT
because IT'S VERY INTRICATE AND DETAILED.
so I ASKED SWEET P. IF SHE'S ABLE TO DO A PAIR OF TROUSERS,
and SHE REASSURED ME THAT SHE CAN DO IT.
do YOU WANNA MAKE THE APRON AND THE THING?
Oh, YEAH. YOU WANT ME TO DO THAT INSTEAD? YEAH.
let ME JUST BONE HER.
bone HER, AND THEN MAKE THE APRON.
pin IT EXTREMELY STRAIGHT ALL THE WAY DOWN.
do YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT?
hmm. ARE YOU SURE?
I THINK WHAT IS SLOWING ME DOWN IS ACTUALLY HAVING TO CONSTANTLY ANSWER
and ATTEND TO, UH, SWEET P.
because SHE'S STRUGGLING WITH, UM, A PAIR OF PANTS.
I JUST FEEL LIKE THE PANTS SHOULD BE ALMOST FINISHED.
that's MY ONLY CONCERN.
they ARE ALMOST FINISHED. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH WORK IN HERE.
look, DUDE! WE WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH GETTING THE PANT AND THE CORSET SEWN. AND WE'VE FINISHED THOSE.
and WE'VE ALSO DRAPED MOST OF THE GOWN.
so I'M NOT REALLY COMPREHENDING WHY HE'S SO STRESSED OUT WHEN WE ARE ACTUALLY AHEAD OF THE GAME.
these ARE ALMOST DONE, RAMI. OKAY, COOL.
I'm JUST TELLING YOU. ALL RIGHT.
I'm JUST THINKING AHEAD.
any DYSFUNCTION THAT HAPPENS IN THE TEAM,
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO BE BLAMED FOR IT.
my ASS IS ON THE LINE, BASICALLY, HERE.
coming UP ON PROJECT RUNWAY
I HAVE A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.
Oh, MY GOD.
my REACTION IS HORROR. NAUSEA.
all RIGHT, MAN.
do I HAVE ENOUGH CIGARETTES FOR THE DAY?
I'm KIND OF WORRIED TO GO INTO PARSONS TODAY,
because RAMI JUST SEEMED UPSET LAST NIGHT.
so I AM HOPING THINGS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THIS MORNING.
let's GET TO WORK.
again? GO.
sweet P'S A LITTLE DYSLEXIC.
I NEVER KNOW WHAT DOOR TO OPEN.
you're GONNA GO DO THE RUFFLES.
the CRINOLINE. OKAY, AND I'M GONNA JUST
and YOU'RE WORKING ON HER APRONS. YEAH.
we're THERE, GIRL.
work.
the CHALLENGE IS TO DO SOMETHING AVANT-GARDE INSPIRED BY THE MODEL'S HAIR.
and IT CAN BE ANYTHING.
so I'M EXCITED.
what DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE?
something OUT THE BACK.
maybe I DO THINK BUSTLE.
some DRAMA. WHAT IS THE GOAL?
cause IT COULD LOOK LIKE ...AND BE OVER THE TOP. OF COURSE.
I MENTIONED BUSTLING A FEW TIMES.
and IF WE BUILD THE BACK OF THE DRESS OUT,
I THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK REALLY COOL.
but HE'S NOT REALLY LISTENING.
let ME TAKE OVER THIS.
okay? MM-HMM.
designers, MAY I ASK YOU TO GATHER ROUND, PLEASE?
I HAVE A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.
I GET SCARED OF SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.
there WILL BE ANOTHER LOOK WALKING DOWN THE RUNWAY TOMORROW.
what's THAT MEAN?
another LOOK.
I WANTED TO THROW UP. OH, MY GOD, I WAS SO PISSED.
each OF YOUR TEAMS MUST CREATE A READY-TO-WEAR GARMENT
that EMBODIES THE ESSENCE OF YOUR AVANT-GARDE LOOK.
let ME ASSERT THAT EVERY MAJOR FASHION DESIGNER MUST DO THIS.
provoke AND INSPIRE WITH HIGH-END CONCEPTUAL WORK
and TRANSLATE IT TO SALEABLE READY-TO-WEAR.
and THIS HAS TO BE DONE BY TOMORROW?
by TOMORROW.
Oh, MY GOD.
you WILL HAVE AN ADDITIONAL BUDGET OF $50 FOR THIS LOOK.
and WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU UNTIL 1: 00 A. M.
I'm GOING TO GIVE YOU 15 MINUTES TO TALK AMONG YOURSELVES.
and THEN WE'LL BE GOING TO MOOD,
where YOU'LL HAVE 15 MINUTES TO SHOP.
and ONLY ONE TEAM MEMBER MUST GO.
I'm GONNA GIVE YOU 15 MINUTES TO CAUCUS.
and I'LL BE BACK.
thank YOU.
so I ALREADY HAD AN IDEA. BLOUSE, DRESS, SKIRT?
dress, DRESS. SIMPLE DRESS.
we WANNA BE--AND THEN WE DO A BAND. HMM.
right AWAY, KIT LOOKS AT ME.
she's LIKE, WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE A LITTLE DRESS.
and I SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
I'll DRAPE IT." IT'S CAKE FOR ME.
I DO IT DAY IN AND DAY OUT.
I WANNA PICK OUT THE FABRIC.
and WE'LL JUST DO THIS SIMPLE LITTLE CHIC
little OUTFIT.
I'm NOT SCARED AT ALL.
just FOCUS ON ONE.
whoever GETS FINISHED STARTS IT. A SHIRTDRESS, MAYBE? WHEN--YEAH.
I'm ALREADY OFF SCHEDULE.
so MY REACTION IS HORROR, NAUSEA.
I THINK NAVY. WHY IS IT NAVY?
because IT KIND OF TIES IN WITH THE PANT, AND
but THE PANT IS THE BACKGROUND-- I FEEL LIKE IT MAKES IT DAY.
I FEEL LIKE IT MAKES IT DAY, THOUGH.
navy's NOT SO MUCH DAY, I THINK.
right AWAY, I HAVE AN IDEA.
and HE'S IMMEDIATELY LIKE, "I DON'T LIKE THAT COLOR.
and I'M LIKE, "OKAY.＂
sketch FOR ME WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND.
I GO FROM THE MOST.
I CAN'T BE IN THE DARK WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU DON'T TRUST THAT I'M GONNA
because YOU DON'T SEEM TOO SURE ABOUT IT!
you're NOT TELLING ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING？
you SCRIBBLED OUT YOUR SKETCH, SO I'M CONFUSED.
sweet P WAS NOT CLEAR TO WHAT SHE WANTED TO DESIGN.
but SINCE WE ARE A TEAM, I REALLY NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE.
I'm NOT ASKING FOR A LOT. CUT ME A SWATCH.
okay.
all RIGHT, DESIGNERS, YOUR 15 MINUTES IS UP.
I'm LEADING THE GROUP TO MOOD.
who's COMING WITH ME?
okay.
thank YOU, JILLIAN.
pray FOR US.
get OUT OF THE WAY!
love YOU, BYE.
Oh, WAIT, I NEED THAT PRINT.
I CHOSE TO GO TO MOOD JUST BECAUSE I'M FAST,
and I KIND OF KNEW EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED.
like, THIS IS MY MAIN CHOICES HERE. LIKE A GRAY...
Ooh, THAT'S GORGEOUS.
I JUST STARTED RUNNING AROUND. AND I FOUND SOME BEAUTIFUL SILVER SHANTUNG.
and I THINK I'LL GET SOMETHIN REALLY CUTE OUT OF THIS.
let's CUT THAT.
just GIVE ME A YARD AND A HALF.
I THINK I CAN MAKE DO.
I PULLED EVERYTHING TOGETHER THAT I NEEDED.
let's GET THIS FABRIC AND GET OUT OF HERE SO WE CAN MAKE SOMETHING WITH IT.
time's UP.
let's HEAD BACK TO THE WORKROOM NOW, OKAY?
okay.
how'd IT GO, JILLIAN?
went GOOD. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I BOUGHT.
I GOT THIS. COOL.
so I WILL START DRAPING.
but I'LL JUST DRAPE. SHOW YOU. JUST SHOW ME.
just SHOW ME. THAT'S FINE. BEFORE I
on TO THE NEXT ONE. FROM FANTASY TO REALITY.
designers,
I'm BRINGING IN THE MODELS SO YOU CAN HAVE A FITTING.
they'll BE HERE FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES.
all RIGHT? THANK YOU.
use YOUR TIME WELL. MAKE IT WORK.
Hi. COME ON IN.
have FUN.
Hi, LADIES.
how ARE YOU? GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?
I LOVE THIS HERE, I THINK.
but I'M NOT SURE IF I LOVE IT HERE.
I THINK IT NEEDS SOME MORE INTERESTING, NO?
I THINK RAMI DID END UP PUTTING WAY TOO MUCH STUFF ON THE DRESS.
and HE DISAGREED WITH ME.
but I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK ADDING SO MUCH STUFF TO IT IS WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AVANT-GARDE.
step IN.
this IS GONNA BE SO HEAVY.
this LOOKS [bleep]ING CRAZY.
I'm SO EXCITED.
once MARIE PUT OUR AVANT-GARDE LOOK ON,
it REALLY TRANSFORMED THE WHOLE PIECE.
you HAVE TO STEP BACK AND SAY, "WOW, THIS IS REALLY COOL.＂
dude, IT LOOKS SO GOOD.
as USUAL, I ONLY HAVE A PANT TO PUT ON YOU. OKAY.
so AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING.
so JILLIAN HAS NOTHING THAT SHE NEEDS-- YEAH, NOT YET.
this DRESS IS PRETTY MUCH ALREADY DONE.
okay, GREAT. I'M GLAD YOU'RE DONE. SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.
everybody's DONE EXCEPT FOR ME AND VICTORYA.
great.
we ARE STILL IN DEVELOPMENT PHASE, AND...
we WEREN'T COMPLETELY PREPARED TO HAVE A FULL FITTING.
my CONCERN IS THAT VICTORYA IS IMMUNE FOR THIS CHALLENGE,
ultimately, IF WE'RE ON THE BOTTOM,
it's IMMEDIATELY ME WHO HAS TO GO.
Oh, MY GOD. OH, YEAH?
I TOLD YOU SHE'S MAGICAL. WAIT.
just DISLOCATE MY SHOULDERS, I'M FINE.
does THIS HURT?
make IT, LIKE...A LITTLE LOOSER,
okay. DON'T KILL HER.
what I HOPE HAPPENS TOMORROW AT THE RUNWAY SHOW IS THAT OUR MODEL, MARCIA, COMES OUT
and PEOPLE'S JAWS DROP TO THE FLOOR.
and THEY NEVER FORGET IT AS LONG AS THEY LIVE.
work. OH, GIRL.
you GOTTA BRING IT BACK.
girls, YOU GOTTA BRING IT BACK FROM THE SIDE AND TURN.
that's GOOD. THAT'S REALLY CUTE.
thank YOU. YEAH.
RAMI'S LETTING ME DO THE READY-TO-WEAR LOOK.
and IT'S SUPER CUTE. AND IT'S TOTALLY ME.
I NEED YOU TO FINISH THE DRESS AND THE PANTS-- RAMI. HOLD UP.
I'm GONNA FINISH THESE. OKAY.
I NEED TO KNOW WHEN WE'RE GONNA FINISH. THAT'S ALL I'M ENTITLED.
so I WALK INTO THE WORKROOM
and SWEET P HAS BEEN ON THE CUTTING TABLE FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
I'm LEADING THE TEAM. I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING'S GOING ON SCHEDULE.
my ASS IS ON THE LINE, OKAY?
so IS MINE. I'M LEADING THE TEAM--NO, MINE IS MORE THAN YOURS.
please UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT'S ALL I NEED YOU TO DO, PLEASE. DON'T GET MAD. I'M JUST SAYING, I'M TOTALLY GONNA FINISH
this IS SO SIMPLE, WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW. OKAY, LET'S JUST HAVE A TIME PLAN. THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING FOR.
Oh, GOD.
sweet P GETS DEFENSIVE.
so I'M FEELING LIKE I NEED TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL.
and IT'S DRAINING A LOT OF MY ENERGY.
he MAKES IT HARD FOR ME TO WORK.
we HAVE TO [bleep] WALK. I'M ALMOST DONE.
sorry. NO, IT'S OKAY.
I KNOW THIS IS HARD.
I JUST WAS, LIKE, SO MAD.
it's JUST ROUGH, YOU KNOW?
I KNOW.
I TOLD HIM, "DUDE, JUST CALM DOWN.
I WISH RAMI WOULD JUST, LIKE,
please GET OFF MY BACK.
thank YOU.
coming UP ON PROJECT RUNWAY I'M WORRIED.
the PROBLEM HERE IS THAT WE THINK DIFFERENTLY.
I'm JUST HOPING WE DON'T END UP IN SOME KIND OF FISTFIGHT.
designers AND MODELS.
may I ASK YOU TO GATHER ROUND, PLEASE?
designers AND MODELS.
I HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST I WANT TO INTRODUCE.
that's NOT SO SCARY.
please WELCOME NATHANIEL HAWKINS.
Nathaniel IS LEAD STYLIST FOR THE TRESEMME HAIR CARE CREATIVE TEAM.
welcome TO PARSONS THE NEW SCHOOL FOR DESIGN.
thank YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Nathaniel's HERE TO CONSULT WITH YOU ON THE HAIRSTYLE FOR YOUR READY-TO-WEAR LOOK.
what WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY
is TO TRANSLATE THE AVANT-GARDE HAIRSTYLE INTO A LOOK FOR THE EVERYDAY WOMAN.
we WANT TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT IS BEAUTIFUL, EFFORTLESS, YET PRACTICAL.
and NATHANIEL HAS A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.
the WINNING TEAM'S LOOKS AND MODELS WILL BE FEATURED IN A TRESEMME AD IN ELLE MAGAZINE.
Thanks, NATHANIEL! THANK YOU.
to BE IN ELLE MAGAZINE FOR TRESEMME, THAT'S EXCITING.
and IT MAKES US WANT TO WORK HARDER.
hello. HELLO.
on HER, I WOULD DO A LITTLE BIT OF FULLNESS.
and CREATE A SMALLER, MORE ELEGANT SHAPE.
sounds PERFECT.
we STILL CAN CREATE A SMOOTHER CROWN, BUILDING INTO VERY LOOSE
Yeah, PERFECT. I LOVE IT.
so JACQUELINE HAS THAT CRAZY FAUXHAWK. YES,
I THOUGHT THAT WE COULD DO HAIR PRESSED PERFECTLY SMOOTH. WITH THE LONG, XURIOUHAIR I LOVE THAT.
strong SIDE PART.
and WE'LL GET A NICE, SOFT SHAPE. WOULDN'T THAT BE RAD?
it WILL BE SO PRETTY ON HER.
Thanks, NATHANIEL. BYE, SWEET P. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
Hi, EVERYBODY.
how's TEAM FIERCE?
well, WHAT DO YOU THINK? PRETTY FIERCE.
well, I HAVE TO TELL YOU GUYS,
this IS STAGGERING.
but THIS TRANSLATION TO READY-TO-WEAR WORRIES ME.
this LOOKS KIND OF CHEAP.
Oh, MY GOD. I THINK IT LOOKS SO EXPENSIVE.
I'm DUBIOUS. OKAY.
I THINK IT'LL BE VERY CHIC.
and I'LL TOTALLY FIGHT THAT. IF I HAVE TO.
kit, RICKY. YES, WE ARE VERY EXCITED.
all RIGHT.
all THESE RIBBONS ARE GONNA JUST BECOME A GIANT NEST.
is IT COSTUME?
and THE ANSWER IS, "YEAH.＂
but IT'S CONCEPTUAL.
is THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN DO TO DRAMATIZE THIS?
does IT NEED MORE OF THIS TO PUNCH IT UP?
no, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
just HAVE IT BE EXUBERANT.
thank YOU, TIM. OKAY.
just DO IT.
Santa MARIA. LET'S GO.
so RAMI. YES.
sweet P. HOW ARE YOU DOING? GOOD.
this IS THE CORSET GOWN.
it's WORN AS A BLOUSE.
is THIS GOING TO SURPRISE THEM?
or IS THIS GOING TO BE WHAT THEY EXPECT?
you DON'T THINK IT'S OVER THE TOP ENOUGH, IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
we're ASKING YOU TO GO MANY STEPS HIGHER. MM-HMM.
and HAVE YOU GONE HIGH ENOUGH? THEY HAVE NOT SEEN ME DO CORSETS, TIM.
they HAVE NOT SEEN THAT. THE ONLY THING I'M GONNA SAY
I'm WORRIED. OKAY.
the PROBLEM HERE IS THAT WE THINK DIFFERENTLY, AND WE'RE WORKING AS A TEAM.
and IT'S A CONFLICT.
I THINK THAT'S MORE IN OUR WORK PROCESS. WELL, HOW HAS THE EXPERIENCE BEEN SO FAR?
I WANT YOU TO TALK A LITTLE BIT.
how IS THAT, THE WAY YOU WORK TOGETHER?
we JUST BOTH WORK REALLY DIFFERENTLY.
we DO, WE DO. SO IT'S BEEN--IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT.
tim IS SAYING, "THIS DRESS LOOKS TOO MUCH LIKE YOU, RAMI." AND IT'S LIKE...
what DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH HOW WE WORK AS A TEAM?
other THAN HE WON'T LET ME IN.
all RIGHT. CARRY ON. OKAY. THANKS.
VICTORYA, JILLIAN. HOW ARE YOU DOING?
we're DOING OKAY. STRESSED FOR TIME.
we're JUST MOVING AS FAST AS WE CAN POSSIBLY MOVE.
I WANT TO ASSERT THAT THIS COAT IS FABULOUS.
you CAN ACHIEVE THIS,
this IS INCREDIBLE.
Yeah.
the SECOND OUTFIT, WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED IT.
it's A MATTER OF FINISHING THIS
and IT'S A MATTER OF...
that SECOND LOOK.
okay.
carry ON.
thank YOU. THANKS, TIM.
I'll BE IN THE SEWING ROOM. OKAY--I THINK I WILL JOIN YOU, JILLIAN.
Oh, GREAT.
so RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT TALKING.
and IT'S A LITTLE TENSE.
I'm TOTALLY EXPECTING TO BE IN THE BOTTOM TOMORROW.
that's ONE REASON I REALLY WANTED TO PULL MY DRESS TOGETHER,
so THAT I CAN STAND STRONG WITH SOMETHING REALLY GREAT ON THE RUNWAY MYSELF.
what? NO...
No!
all RIGHT, YOU...
come ON.
let's SEW.
by THE END OF THE EVENING, I STILL HAD SOME FINISHINGS TO DO ON MY TWO GARMENTS.
Jillian AS WELL HAD NOT COMPLETELY FINISHED HER COAT.
I HAVE NO IDEA IF WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO EVEN START THE SECOND LOOK.
Yeah, LET'S GO.
so [bleep]ING TIRED.
Oh, I CAN'T EVEN WALK.
everybody READY?
I'm KIND OF WONDERING
how RAMI'S GOING TO BE TODAY.
I'm JUST HOPING WE DON'T END UP
in SOME KIND OF FIST FIGHT.
okay, LET'S GO.
I'm READY. I'VE BEEN WAITING.
come ON.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE AN EXPENSIVE ENOUGH DRESS. YEAH, I DON'T THINK
the FIRST THING THAT I DO IS START ON THAT SECOND DRESS.
in ORDER TO FINISH, I'M GOING TO MOVE LIKE THE SPEED OF LIGHT TODAY.
good MORNING, DESIGNERS.
Hi, TIM.
I'm GOING TO BE SENDING IN YOUR READY-TO-WEAR MODELS MOMENTARILY.
your AVANT-GARDE MODELS ARE ALREADY IN HAIR.
you'll HAVE A TWO-HOUR PERIOD OF TIME
to SEND YOUR MODELS TO THE L'OREAL PARIS MAKEUP ROOM AND THE TRESEMME HAIR SALON.
all RIGHT.
Hi, DARLING. LET ME TRY THIS ON YOU.
see, WITH THE NO SLEEVES, IT'S DONE.
it's VERY CHIC. IT'S PERFECT.
I THINK IT'S CUTE. IT'S A DRESS. IT'S SUPER CASUAL.
the READY-TO-WEAR DRESS LOOKS REALLY SIMPLE.
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE DONE
but BECAUSE WE WERE TELLING KIT'S STORY,
that's THE STORY.
it's PERFECT.
it's FINE. IT'S WHAT IT IS.
so THIS IS GONNA BE YOUR FRONT SECTION.
just PUT YOUR HANDS UP.
this IS COUTURE HILARITY.
make SURE THE PIECE IS ALWAYS TUCKED IN.
in ALL HONESTY, I KNOW WE'RE GONNA WIN.
just HAS TO HAPPEN.
I SMELL TRESEMME AD.
right HERE--IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT?
JUST--THAT'S THE LEAST OF MY PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW.
in THE END, I PUT THE SECOND DRESS ON MY MODEL.
but IT IS LIKE A LAST-MINUTE AFTERTHOUGHT.
it's BEAUTIFUL.
can YOU CUT ME A PIECE OF THREAD, AMANDA?
I CAN DO IT. HERE.
I REALLY LIKE OUR FINAL GARMENT,
because I THINK IT STANDS APART FROM THE OTHER DESIGNERS.
I AM A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS, HOWEVER,
because IT'S JUST REALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHERE EVERYONE ELSE WENT.
are YOU SURE ABOUT THESE BOOTS? YEAH.
designers AND MODELS, THIS IS IT.
we're GOING DOWN TO THE RUNWAY.
okay, SO FOLLOW ME.
let's GO.
love YOU, MEAN IT.
I'm JUST WORRIED...
we've GOTTA GO.
we DEFINITELY LIVED UP TO TEAM LAST-MINUTE.
I WAS PROUD THAT WE DID A GREAT JOB ON THE AVANT-GARDE LOOK.
I THINK IT WOULD BE AMAZING IF WE WON.
I JUST--AT THIS POINT, I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT WILL HAPPEN.
thank YOU.
coming UP ON PROJECT RUNWAY
I WONDER IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU CAN DO.
it JUST DOES NOT LOOK WELL-MADE.
welcome TO THE RUNWAY.
as YOU KNOW, IN FASHION, ONE DAY YOU'RE IN
and THE NEXT DAY YOU'RE OUT.
for THIS CHALLENGE, WE HAD YOU WORK IN TEAMS OF TWO TO CREATE TWO LOOKS.
an AVANT-GARDE LOOK INSPIRED BY YOUR MODEL'S HAIRSTYLE, AND A SECOND READY-TO-WEAR LOOK
that CAPTURED THE ESSENCE OF THE AVANT-GARDE OUTFIT.
the WINNING OUTFITS WILL BE FEATURED IN A TRESEMME AD IN ELLE MAGAZINE.
let's MEET THE JUDGES.
first WE HAVE TOP AMERICAN DESIGNER MICHAEL KORS.
Hey, GUYS.
next WE HAVE NINA GARCIA, FASHION DIRECTOR OF ELLE MAGAZINE.
Hi, EVERYONE.
and ACCLAIMED ITALIAN DESIGNER ALBERTA FERRETTI.
hello.
Hi.
we WILL SCORE YOUR DESIGNS AS THEY COME DOWN THE RUNWAY.
one OF YOU WILL BE NAMED THE WINNER.
and TONIGHT,
only ONE OF YOU WILL BE OUT.
let's START THE SHOW.
I'm VERY HAPPY AS I'M WATCHING SAM WALK DOWN THE RUNWAY.
I FEEL LIKE I CREATED SOMETHING THAT IS ORIGINAL AND BEAUTIFUL.
I DEFINITELY REALLY LOVED MY DRESS.
I LOVED RAMI'S TOO, YOU KNOW?
I JUST THINK MAYBE IT WASN'T BIG OR GRAND ENOUGH.
I ALWAYS WATCH THE JUDGES' FACES.
and NINA GARCIA COULD NOT KEEP THE LOOK OFF OF HER FACE.
I THINK THAT SHE WAS IMPRESSED BY IT.
my AVANT-GARDE LOOK WAS AMAZING.
the COUTURE POSE IS ALL ABOUT THE CINCHED WAIST AND HUNCHED SHOULDERS.
it WAS SUCH A SHOCK FACTOR FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END.
and THE READY-TO-WEAR LOOK WAS SO CHIC AND LOOKED BEAUTIFUL.
so I WAS 10, 000% HAPPY.
I'm DEFINITELY HAPPY WITH THE AVANT-GARDE LOOK.
but I SEE THE VERY SERIOUS FASHION OF ALL THE OTHER DESIGNERS,
Ricky AND I DIDN'T GO THAT DIRECTION,
so THAT MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS.
to HAVE A SECOND LOOK, YOU REALLY GET THE EXTREMES.
so YOU GET THE REALLY HIGH AND THE REALLY LOW OF THE WHOLE STORY.
we WERE EXCITED, 'CAUSE SHE LOOKED AMAZING.
we LOVED THE SILHOUETTE.
we WERE BOTH HAPPY.
jacqueline REALLY EXECUTED THAT LOOK TO PERFECTION,
and I DON'T THINK THAT ANY OTHER MODEL COULD'VE DONE IT LIKE SHE DID.
I WAS PROUD THAT WE DID FINISH THE READY-TO-WEAR LOOK.
but I WASN'T SATISFIED WITH IT AT ALL.
we've SCORED YOUR DESIGNS.
will THE FOLLOWING TEAMS PLEASE STEP FORWARD?
rami AND SWEET P.
kit AND RICKY.
your TEAMS HAVE THE LOWEST SCORES.
but FIRST, WE'RE GONNA TALK TO THE TEAMS WITH THE HIGHEST SCORES.
you CAN LEAVE THE RUNWAY.
okay, LET'S BRING OUT YOUR MODELS.
what WAS YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS WITH YOUR LOOK?
when I FIRST SAW MARCIA'S HAIR,
we TOOK IT AS, LIKE, A VERY ROMANTIC, UM, OLD WORLD FEELING.
whose, UM, DESIGN WAS IT?
he CAME UP WITH THE COLOR IDEA.
and WE DECIDED ON THE MODEL, WE JUST KINDA WENT, "I CAN DO THIS, YOU CAN DO THAT.＂
and THIS IS 45 YARDS OF FABRIC, JUST TO LET YOU KNOW.
can WE SEE THE...BACK?
is AMAZING, BECAUSE IS--IS A VERY COMPLICATED DRESS.
it's A COUTURE DRESS. BUT THE JOB IS AMAZING.
Ngratulations. THANK YOU.
it's HEAVEN. IT LOOKS BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED.
it's CERTAINLY IMPORTANT AND EXCITING-LOOKING.
I THINK IT'S VERY SOIGNE.
and I THINK THAT THE READY-TO-WEAR, THE BLOUSE IS GREAT-LOOKING
but I THINK THE SKIRT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A THROW AWAY, LET'S BE HONEST.
Yeah, IT'S NOT PERFECT, I KNOW.
but OBVIOUSLY, AS A TEAM, YOU GUYS WORKED WELL TOGETHER.
it COULD BE A COVER TRY, THIS--THIS LOOK.
it's REALLY, REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
okay, VICTORYA.
tell US ABOUT YOUR AVANT-GARDE LOOK.
the IMMEDIATE REFERENCE WE HAD WAS SOMETHING VERY PUNK
with AN EQUESTRIAN LEITMOTIF.
the SILHOUETTE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL.
cutting VERY WELL, YES.
can WE SEE THE BLOUSE AND THE PANTS?
I LIKE THE SHIRT. I DO TOO.
why'd YOU HIDE THEM? YEAH, WHY?
because THE COAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.
can I SEE THE BACK OF THE JODHPURS?
it's ADORABLE, THE BLOUSE. THE BACK OF THE BLOUSE IS GREAT.
and I DON'T MIND THE TARTAN LITTLE BLACK DRESS.
I MEAN, I THINK IT'S CUTE.
we HAVE THREE LOOKS.
no, YOU DO! YES, YOU DO.
you HAVE THREE LOOKS.
so WE SHOULD WIN.
okay, WE'VE HEARD WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.
you CAN LEAVE THE RUNWAY.
thank YOU.
all RIGHT, LET'S BRING OUT THE TEAMS WITH THE LOWEST SCORES.
RAMI, PLEASE TELL US ABOUT YOUR AVANT-GARDE LOOK.
when I FIRST LOOKED AT SAM,
instantly I THOUGHT OF A CORSET.
I IMAGINED SOMETHING THAT IS FLOWY.
we PAIRED IT WITH A PAIR OF PANTS
to KIND OF CREATE SORT OF TWO ODDS AND HAVE THEM MEET TOGETHER.
who DID WHAT EXACTLY?
I MADE THE GOWN WITH THE CORSET.
sweet P MADE THE PANTS AND THE DRESS.
the DRESS IS BEAUTIFUL.
it's A CUTE DRESS.
the COMMERCIAL DRESS, IN THIS INSTANCE, TO ME,
is MORE FORWARD-LOOKING THAN THE AVANT-GARDE PIECE.
RAMI, I KNOW THAT YOU DO DRAPING IMPECCABLY.
I WONDER IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU CAN DO.
the DRESS, THE VOLUME IS NOT SO DRAMATIC. IT'S TOO NORMAL.
maybe THE SHAPE OF THE TROUSER COULD'VE BEEN MORE MASCULINE.
can WE SEE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE NOW?
she LOOKS LIKE HER ASS IS IN HER FRONT.
like, THE GOWN COULD'VE HAD SOMETHING THAT WHEN SHE WALKED OUT, IT JUST WENT, "WHOO.
wanted TO ADD SOMETHING BACK HERE, LIKE AN EXPLOSION OUT OF HER REAR YOU KNOW, I KNOW IT SOUNDS KOOKY
but, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT HE WAS REALLY TAKING OWNERSHIP OF HIS DESIGN,
and DIDN'T REALLY WANT ME PUTTING TOO MUCH INTO IT.
we WERE TWO ODDS WORKING TOGETHER,
that's WHAT SORT OF TOOK AWAY FROM THE, UM, LOUDNESS.
we WORK DIFFERENT WAYS. YES.
you DO KNOW THAT THE BEST DESIGN TEAMS
are NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE EXACTLY THE SAME. SURE.
or ELSE YOU'RE JUST SITTING AND TELLING, "YOU'RE FABULOUS." YOU KNOW, "YOU'RE FABULOUS.
I MEAN, YOU WANT SOMEONE ELSE'S OPINION. AND YOU GET NOTHING DONE.
I MEAN, YOU GET NOTHING.
and YOU JUST-- YOU WERE ARM WRESTLING HE WHOLE TIME.
kit. HELLO.
how DID YOU DIVIDE UP THE WORK BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU?
I MADE THE SKIRT.
and RICKY MADE THE CORSET
and THE READY-TO-WEAR DRESS.
it's SO STRANGE, THAT DRESS
because IT'S NOT AVANT-GARDE
it's CHEAP, IT'S REAL CHEAP.
it's A LITTLE SCARLETT O'HARA.
but IN A CHEAP WAY.
I HAVE TO SAY WHAT ALBERTA SAID ABOUT, YOU KNOW, SCARLETT O'HARA RIPPED THE DRAPES DOWN.
but SHE MADE A COUTURE DRESS OUT OF HER DRAPES.
this, SHE RIPPED THE SHEETS OFF THE BED AND RAN OUT THE DOOR
I THINK ALSO, IT JUST DOES NOT LOOK WELL-MADE.
you KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THE SATIN,
it IS ALL, LIKE, WRINKLY.
it--I FEEL LIKE IT NEEDS TO BE STEAMED OR SOMETHING.
if I WERE PULLING FOR A COUTURE, AVANT-GARDE PHOTO SHOOT,
this WOULD NOT BE IT.
and I THINK THE READY-TO-WEAR OUTFIT
is EQUALLY DISAPPOINTING.
okay, WE'VE HEARD WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY.
we're GONNA HAVE A LITTLE CHAT.
and THEN I'M GONNA CALL YOU BACK.
you CAN LEAVE THE RUNWAY.
so WHO DID WE LIKE?
christian AND CHRIS HAD, I THINK, A REMARKABLE AVANT-GARDE PIECE.
in TWO DAYS, IS AMAZING JOB. THAT IS IMPORTANT.
as A TEAM, THEY WORKED TOGETHER BRILLIANTLY.
normally, YOU KNOW, TWO DESIGNERS,
you STICK TWO THINGS TOGETHER,
it LOOKS LIKE TWO THINGS STUCK TOGETHER.
but IN THIS CASE, IT DIDN'T.
she LOOKED LIKE A PHOTO SHOOT RIGHT THERE.
with VICTORYA AND JILLIAN,
I LOVED THE DRESS.
I LOVED THE PANTS AND THE SHIRT.
and I LOVED THE COAT.
it JUST LOOKED TERRIFIC.
very, VERY GOOD JOB IN ALL DIRECTIONS.
you COULD SEE A LOT OF WOMEN
really WANTING TO WEAR THOSE CLOTHES. YEAH.
what DID WE THINK ABOUT RAMI AND SWEET P'S TEAM?
he KNOWS HE CAN DRAPE VERY WELL.
and THAT'S WHAT HE CONSISTENTLY GIVES US.
but SHOW US SOMETHING ELSE FOR A CHANGE.
his EXCUSE WAS
he WAS THROWING HER UNDER THE BUS.
she EXECUTED THE DAYTIME DRESS VERY NICELY. YEAH.
it WAS A GREAT, GREAT LITTLE DAYTIME DRESS.
and THEN KIT AND RICKY.
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY EVEN WRAPPED THEIR HEAD AROUND THE WORD "AVANT-GARDE.＂
it IS SO STRANGE.
because THEIR REALIZATION IS TERRIBLE.
she PICKED OUT THESE FABRICS,
which I THINK LOOKED VERY POOR.
if THEY WOULD'VE EXECUTED IT IN A BEAUTIFUL WAY WITH BEAUTIFUL MATERIALS,
it COULD'VE WORKED.
the ONE THING I WILL SAY, THOUGH,
is THE CONSTRUCTION OF THAT HOOP FROM SCRATCH
that WAS GOOD.
but IT DIDN'T HELP THE LOOK OF THE CLOTHES. NO.
and THEN, THE READY-TO-WEAR DRESS TRULY LOOKED LIKE THE POOREST...
amateur. EVERYTHING LOOKED AMATEUR.
so WE'VE MADE OUR DECISION?
Yeah.
okay, LET'S BRING THEM BACK OUT.
one OF YOU WILL BE NAMED THE WINNER.
and ONE OF YOU WILL BE OUT.
one OF YOU WILL BE NAMED THE WINNER.
and ONE OF YOU WILL BE OUT.
let's START WITH THE WINNER.
it WAS BETWEEN CHRISTIAN'S TEAM
and VICTORYA'S TEAM.
congratulations...
you WERE THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE.
your LOOKS WILL BE FEATURED IN A TRESEMME AD
in ELLE MAGAZINE.
Christian, BECAUSE YOU WERE THE TEAM LEADER,
you WILL ALSO HAVE IMMUNITY
and CAN'T BE ELIMINATED IN THE NEXT CHALLENGE.
you BOTH CAN LEAVE THE RUNWAY.
I WANT TO WIN THEM ALL, BUT THIS CHALLENGE REALLY MEANT SOMETHING.
I'm REALLY EXCITED, AND IT'S GREAT TO BE IN ELLE.
being YOUNG, I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH PRESS YET.
good WORK. YOU'RE BOTH IN.
you CAN LEAVE THE RUNWAY.
you're IN.
you CAN LEAVE THE RUNWAY.
you're IN.
you CAN LEAVE THE RUNWAY.
one OF YOU WILL BE OUT.
RAMI, YOUR AVANT-GARDE LOOK WASN'T DRAMATIC.
unfortunately, THE ONLY DRAMA THAT WE SAW WAS BETWEEN YOU AND SWEET P.
and AS A TEAM LEADER,
that IS YOUR FAULT.
kit, WE WANTED YOU TO GIVE US SOMETHING FASHION-FORWARD.
but INSTEAD, YOU TOOK US BACKWARDS.
but NOT IN A GOOD WAY.
you're OUT.
that MEANS RAMI, YOU'RE IN.
you CAN LEAVE THE RUNWAY.
auf WIEDERSEHEN, KIT.
thank YOU. BYE.
you GUYS, IF ANY OF YOU CRY, I'M GONNA START CRYING.
I HONESTLY DON'T BELIEVE IN REGRET.
and I HAVE NO REGRETS.
I WENT OUT, AND I WENT OUT BIG.
so I NEED TO SEND YOU UPSTAIRS TO CLEAN UP YOUR SPACE, OKAY? LET'S DO IT.
love YOU. LOVE YOU. BYE, KIT.
I'm REALLY, REALLY SAD THAT I'M LEAVING.
but I HAVE TWO FULL SUITCASES OF FRIENDSHIP AND SUCCESS.
it's UNFORTUNATE FOR ME,
but IT'S ALSO UNFORTUNATE FOR THE COMPETITION THAT I'M OUT.
okay, HERE WE GO.
could YOU COME A STEP?
the TRESEMME AD IS PRETTY AMAZING.
give ATTITUDE. EXACTLY.
team FIERCE-- OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU JOKING?
it WAS TOTAL DESTINY.
next ON PROJECT RUNWAY
behind THIS DOOR, YOU'LL FIND THE RAW MATERIALS FOR YOUR CHALLENGE.
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE.
fabulous.
if YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION BY NOW,
you're REFUSING TO LEARN.
are YOU ALL RIGHT, JILLIAN?
I'm REALLY STARTING TO FEEL THE WEIGHT OF ALL OF THIS PRESSURE.
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO WOULD REALLY WANNA LOOK LIKE THAT.
it LOOKS A LITTLE HOME-SEWN.
you WERE NOT INSPIRED BY THIS AT ALL.
this IS LIKE A ROLLER COASTER. YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO.
for YOUR NEXT CHALLENGE,
you WILL CHOOSE A WORK OF ART
to SERVE AS THE INSPIRATION
for A LOOK OF YOUR CHOICE.
this IS EVERY DESIGNER'S DREAM.
Joan RIVERS CARVED HER INITIALS IN HERE
when SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL.
Jillian's been pressing for three hours.
I FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS ENOUGH AS IT IS.
EW, DON'T GET BITCHY.
I AM A LITTLE BIT WORRIED.
this IS WHAT DETERMINES WHO'S GOING TO FASHION WEEK.
sweet P! YOUR MODEL'S LATE.
if MY DRESS ISN'T FINISHED, FOR SURE I'LL GET ELIMINATED.
CONGRATULATIONS...CHRISTIAN.
this WIN GUARANTEES YOU A SPOT
at NEW YORK FASHION WEEK.
thank YOU.
you ARE ALSO GUARANTEED A SPOT
to SHOW AT NEW YORK FASHION WEEK.
thank YOU.
sweet P, YOU'RE OUT.
thank YOU.
it WAS OUR LAST CHALLENGE BEFORE BRYANT PARK.
and I WANTED TO GO.
Chris, YOU'RE IN.
you're ALSO IN.

don't GET TOO EXCITED.
because ONLY ONE OF YOU
will MOVE ON TO COMPETE
at FASHION WEEK.
the WINNER OF PROJECT RUNWAY WILL RECEIVE
a SPREAD IN ELLE MAGAZINE,
an OPPORTUNITY TO SELL THEIR LINE
on BLUEFLY. COM,
an ALL-NEW 2008 SATURN ASTRA,

furnished BY TRESEMME PROFESSIONAL HAIR CARE.
this IS PROJECT RUNWAY.
let's GO.
hell, YES, I'M THE BEST.
you're EITHER IN, OR YOU'RE OUT.
I'm IN...THEY'RE OUT.
I WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT DEAD IN HIS CLOTHES.
fashion IS MY LIFE.
who WILL BE THE NEXT BIG FASHION DESIGNER?
that's ME.
bottom LINE, I'M THE BEST.
I WILL OWN THE RUNWAY.
for THESE 15 DESIGNERS,
project RUNWAY IS THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME.
Hi! HI.
congratulations FOR MAKING IT THIS FAR.

of 12 LOOKS
for FASHION WEEK.
we're GOING TO GIVE YOU A BUDGET OF $8, 000
and THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS TO PUT IT TOGETHER.
you're GUARANTEED SPOTS
at FASHION WEEK.
RAMI, CHRIS, YOU WILL CREATE COLLECTIONS.
when YOU RETURN TO NEW YORK FOR FASHION WEEK,
you MUST SHOW ME AND THE OTHER JUDGES
your THREE STRONGEST LOOKS FROM YOUR COLLECTIONS.
we WILL JUDGE THEM
and DETERMINE WHICH ONE OF YOU
will MOVE ON TO FASHION WEEK.
okay.
all OF YOU HAVE DECIDED TO KEEP
your MODELS FROM THE LAST CHALLENGE.
now LET'S BRING OUT A FAMILIAR FACE.
Hi! HI.
it's SO UNUSUAL FOR ME TO BE ON THE RUNWAY.
and YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD UP HERE. THANK YOU.
so DESIGNERS,
I'll BE CHECKING IN WITH EACH OF YOU
in THE COMING MONTHS.
but BEFORE I DO, I WANT TO REMIND YOU
that YOU WILL BE SHOWING TO THE LARGEST
and MOST INFLUENTIAL CROWD IN THE INDUSTRY.
the WORLD WILL BE WATCHING.
to CELEBRATE, LET'S HAVE ONE FINAL TOAST
at THE GOTHAM APARTMENTS ROOFTOP.
come ON, LET'S GO.
great! COME, TIM. I'LL SEE YOU THERE.
so WE HAVE SOME MOET & CHANDON HERE FOR YOU FOR OUR TOAST.
designers, HEIDI AND I ARE EXCEPTIONALLY PROUD OF YOU.
so HERE'S TO YOU AND YOUR COLLECTION.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU GUYS COME UP WITH.
[hums] SO EXCITED TO HAVE WON THE LAST CHALLENGE.
I HAVE A GUARANTEED INTO FASHION WEEK.
how ABOUT THAT? DON'T PLAY GAMES.
and I'M 21 YEARS OLD. THAT'S FIERCE.
and POSE!
[Chris laughing] AND POSE.
and BACK.
I REALLY WORKED MY ASS OFF, AND I HAVE MY EYE ON THE PRIZE.
all I CAN SEE IS WINNING.
that ONE'S BIGGER THAN ME.
I KNOW.
you CAN TAKE CHRISTIAN HOME IN YOUR SUITCASE.
wanna COME TO L. A? YOU CAN JUST HOP IN.
Bye, LOVE YA.
love YOUR HAIR.
once WE THOUGHT THE ROLLER COASTER WAS OVER,
there WAS STILL ANOTHER LOOP.
but I LEARNED FROM THE JUDGES THAT THEY WANT MORE DRAMA.
and I'M VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF DOING.
having TO COMPETE FOR THE FINAL SPOT AT FASHION WEEK,
I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY.
because I THINK I DEFINITELY DESERVE IT.
I GUESS I'M JUST GONNA TRY
to DO MY BEST, AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
first UP, I'LL VISIT CHRISTIAN SIRIANO,
who's WORKING ON HIS COLLECTION IN NEW YORK CITY.
how ARE YOU, SWEETHEART?
so NICE TO SEE YOU.
great TO SEE YOU TOO. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
I've BEEN REALLY GOOD.
I'm SO EXCITED FOR TIM TO SEE MY LITTLE PLACE.
I HOPE HE LIKES MY STUFF.
but HE WILL, 'CAUSE IT'S FABULOUS.
this IS MY LITTLE ROOM.
it's LIKE A LITTLE BOX, TIM.
Wow. SO THIS IS YOUR STUDIO?
this IS WHERE I SEW EVERYTHING.
on THIS TABLE. AND CUT EVERYTHING.
talk ABOUT MAKE IT WORK. YOU REALLY DO
no, I REALLY MAKE IT WORK.
you HAVE TO. AND I SLEEP RIGHT HERE.
you're KIDDING. NO, LOOK.
this IS MY BED RIGHT HERE.
and I JUST SLIP IT OUT AND IT FITS RIGHT THERE.
perfectly. AND I SLEEP THERE EVERY NIGHT.
and MY BED LINENS ARE IN MY CLOSET.
my BEDROOM BASICALLY WAS THE CLOSET, I THINK.
originally. IT'S SO SMALL.
Yes, IT'S VERY ANNOYING TO SEW IN SUCH A SMALL SPACE.
and YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY ORGANIZED,
or I WOULD GO CRAZY IF I WASN'T.
so THIS IS MY SISTER AND ME.
is SHE YOUNGER OR OLDER?
she's ACTUALLY OLDER.
she JUST LOOKS VERY YOUNG
and PRETTY LIKE ME.
and THAT'S MY MOTHER.
Aww! AND MY MOM'S BOYFRIEND.
I GREW UP IN ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND.
it WAS KIND OF A SMALL TOWN.
very PREPPY AND NAVAL ACADEMY.
but I STARTED WORKING IN A REALLY TRENDY
kind OF HAIR SALON WHEN I WAS ABOUT 13.
people DIDN'T REALLY JUDGE AS MUCH IN THAT INDUSTRY,
so I REALLY, LIKE, WAS LOOKING FOR THAT.
felt LIKE I FIT IN A LITTLE BIT MORE THERE.
and THAT KIND OF JUMP-STARTED MY FASHION CAREER.
so I WENT TO DESIGN SCHOOL IN LONDON
for ABOUT THREE YEARS.
and IT WAS THE BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE.
so THIS IS...
wow, YOU'VE DONE A LOT.
I HAVE A LOT, BUT I HAVE SO MUCH TO DO.
the WHOLE KIND OF THEME IS THIS ROMANTIC,
gothic KIND OF LOOK.
so IT'S KIND OF DARK.
every PIECE IS BASICALLY A REALLY STRONG LOOK.
that's LIKE MY THING.
this WAS THE JACKET
that I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.
but IT HAS STILL THAT KIND OF SHAPE.
what HAPPENS WITH ALL THIS VOLUME
under THIS VERY FITTED JACKET?
it--it's REALLY JUST A NECKPIECE.
and IT'S NOT A FINAL DECISION YET.
like, IT'S-- IT'S JUST A NECKPIECE?
Yeah, IT BASICALLY SITS LIKE THIS
and SCRUNCHED DOWN SO IT'S LIKE THAT.
Oh, SO IT COMES UP TO HER NOSE?
right, IT GOES ALL ACROSS HER FACE LIKE THIS.
I THINK YOU NEED TO ASK YOURSELF "WHEN DO I NOT NEED SOMETHING?"
Yeah.
is THIS PIECE HURT BY NOT DOING THAT?
um... MM-HMM, YEAH.
what's THIS? AND THEN THIS IS THE FINALE LOOK.
now THESE HERE ARE-- THEY STILL NEED WORK.
um, AND I'M GONNA BE BASICALLY FINISHING AND SEWING.
but THEY'LL BE HER PANTS.
aren't THESE AMAZING? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
this LOOKS COSTUMEY.
it LOOKS A LITTLE COSTUMEY.
and I THINK THEY'RE FABULOUS.
I WOULD HATE TO HAVE YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT LOSING THESE.
okay. THEY JUST...
look A LITTLE COSTUMEY.
it's JUST A LOT OF LOOK.
a LOT OF LOOK.
think ABOUT IT. OKAY.
I'm KINDA JUST TAKING EVERYTHING IN THAT HE SAID,
and I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT IT.
but I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA CHANGE TOO MUCH.
you JUST NEED AT THIS POINT TO BRING AN EDITING EYE
to EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE DOING.
everything, YEAH.
an EDITING EYE.
I WANNA WIN SO BAD, IT'S LIKE...
something I'VE NEVER WANTED MORE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
I'll SEE YOU AT FASHION WEEK.
work HARD. THINK HARDER.
I WILL. GOOD.
Bye-bye. THANK YOU.
Bye, TIM. TAKE CARE.
next, I'LL VISIT JILLIAN LEWIS,
who's ALSO WORKING ON HER COLLECTION
in NEW YORK CITY.
Jillian! HI, TIM.
how ARE YOU, SWEETHEART?
I'm SO THRILLED TO SEE YOU. ME TOO.
what A VIEW!
this IS AMAZING.
I KNOW. I LOVE IT.
well, THIS IS REALLY COMPELLING.
when I FIRST GOT BACK FROM THE SHOW,
I DID NOT GO BACK TO MY JOB AT RALPH LAUREN.
I've NEVER REALLY HAD THIS KIND OF TIME
to GO AROUND AND FIND INSPIRATION.
this WAS THE FIRST PIECE THAT I DESIGNED
is IT? WHEN I CAME BACK, YEAH.
I LOVE THIS DETAILING.
Oh, MY GOD, IT TOOK FOREVER.
I CAN TELL. IT MUST HAVE.
but NOW THAT IT'S DONE, IT LOOKS EFFORTLESS.
Yeah, NO, IT'S REALLY WORKING.
it FLOWS.
the LAST CHALLENGE AT THE MUSEUM
was SO MOVING TO ME.
so I DECIDED TO CONTINUE ON IN THAT DIRECTION.
and I RESEARCHED 15TH CENTURY ARMOR.
there's FEMININITY, YET THERE'S STRENGTH.
Yes, AND I LIKED WHEN MICHAEL KORS SAID
you KNOW,"THERE IS A STRENGTH "TO WHAT YOU'VE DESIGNED, BUT I CAN TELL
that A WOMAN DESIGNED IT.
Yeah, BUT I FEEL AS THOUGH YOUR PALETTE
it's A CLOUDY DAY.
for ME, IT'S-- I'M NOT GETTING IT.
Yeah, OKAY.
think ABOUT IT.
he REALLY HAD A LOT OF WISE THINGS TO SAY.
now I CAN TAKE THIS COLLECTION TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE.
I FEEL REALLY CONFIDENT.
so DO YOU WANT TO MEET MY FAMILY?
Oh, I'D LOVE TO!
Yeah, THEY'RE SO EXCITED TO MEET YOU. WHERE ARE THEY?
they're IN LONG ISLAND.
of COURSE ALL OF THE GREAT AMERICAN DESIGNERS
are FROM LONG ISLAND.
all RIGHT.
and JILLIAN LEWIS.
Hi!
Hi, HOW ARE YOU?
it's TIM GUNN!
Hi. WHAT AN HONOR TO MEET YOU.
Tim, IT'S TIM.
I'm REALLY EXCITED TO HAVE TIM MEET MY FAMILY.
um, AND TO SEE THE HOME THAT I WAS RAISED IN.
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO MEET LEWAA.
he's MY BOYFRIEND. HI.
Hi, LEWAA, HOW ARE YOU? NICE MEETING YOU, TIM.
how ARE YOU? NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.
Congratulations. THANK YOU.
he's MY BIG SUPPORT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE IN OUR HOME.
Oh, I'M PROUD TO BE IN YOUR HOME.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
so EVERYBODY KEEPS SAYING ABOUT SANTA CLAUS
comin' TO TOWN, AND I KEEP SAYING, "FORGET ABOUT THAT, TIM GUNN'S COMING TO TOWN!
Oh, THANK YOU.
I WISH I WERE SANTA CLAUS.
Really?
did YOU HAVE ANY APPREHENSIONS
when JILLIAN SAID "I WANT TO BE A FASHION DESIGNER"?
what HAPPENED? BEFORE I WAS EVER MARRIED,
I SAW A CLAIRVOYANT WOMAN,
and SHE SORT OF TOLD ME
that I WAS GONNA HAVE THREE CHILDREN,
and ONE WAS GONNA BE FAMOUS.
well, SHE RAISED ME WITH THIS IDEA TOO THOUGH.
my MOTHER, SHE REALLY DOES EXPECT ME
to BE AMAZING IN THIS LIFE.
when I WAS A CHILD GROWING UP,
I WAS CHASING THIS SOMETHING AND TRYING TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING
so MUCH BIGGER THAN WHAT I AM.
but I WOULD NOT BE HERE IF SHE DIDN'T PUSH ME
from A VERY YOUNG AGE.
look HOW FAR SHE'S GONE.
Yeah, IT'S REALLY TRUE.
it's AMAZING.
I WANT THE WHOLE WORLD TO KNOW WHO I AM,
and TO SEEK OUT THE CLOTHING THAT I DESIGN.
I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY THINKS THAT THEY'RE GOING
to BE THE NEXT GREAT THING,
but I REALLY, REALLY WILL BE.
and...I WON'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY.
why NOT?
coming UP ON PROJECT RUNWAY...
here's THE MOST PROBABLY PROVOCATIVE THING THAT I HAVE
going ON IN MY COLLECTION.
my GAG REFLEX IS KICKING IN.
next UP, RAMI KASHOU,
who's WORKING ON HIS COLLECTION IN LOS ANGELES.
RAMI! HI.
how ARE YOU? IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
great TO SEE YOU TOO.
tim COMING TO L. A. TO VISIT ME
is VERY EXCITING.
meet MY FABULOUS TWO OF MY BEST FRIENDS.
wonderful. HI, I'M TIM GUNN.
Jeff. HI, JEFF, HOW ARE YOU?
nice TO MEET YOU. AND THIS IS JEN.
Hi, JEN. NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.
thank YOU.
it WAS JUST WEIRD, LIKE, JUST TO SEE TIM GUNN
in--in A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT.
so, RAMI, YOUR FAMILY'S WATCHING THE SW.
Yes, THEY ARE.
and HOW ARE THEY RESPONDING?
my PARENTS WANTED ME TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS
to--to TAKE ME TO THAT SORT OF NEXT LEVEL
and SORT OF BREAK THROUGH.
and THEY'RE VERY PROUD.
and I'M VERY LUCKY TO HAVE THEM IN MY LIFE.
I WAS BORN IN THE CITY OF JERUSALEM.
my MOTHER WAS ALWAYS KNOWN TO BE A LOVER FOR FASHION.
she WAS MISS JORDAN IN THE '60s.
SHE...PASSED AWAY WHEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD.
it WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO LOSE HER
at SUCH AN EARLY AGE.
but MY FATHER REMARRIED WHEN I WAS, UM, SEVEN.
and SHE IS THE MOST AMAZING STEPMOTHER
anyone CAN HAVE,
that I DON'T CALL HER STEPMOM, I CALL HER MOM.
it's FUNNY, LIKE, THEY'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
that THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO DO.
and--and I KEPT IT A SECRET FOR A LONG TIME FROM THEM,
because I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT, "OH, I'M A GUY," YOU KNOW,
it's AN ARABIC ENVIRONMENT,
this IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT VERY MASCULINE, PER SE.
so IT WAS THIS, LIKE,
hidden SECRET, AND THEN ONE TIME
my BROTHER WALKED IN ON ME.
and I'D BEEN SKETCHING FOR YEARS
I WAS PROBABLY LIKE 12 OR SOMETHING.
he GRABBED THE-- THE NOTEBOOK FROM ME.
and HE RAN DOWNSTAIRS TO MY PARENTS TO SHOW THEM,
and I REMEMBER AT THAT MOMENT I WAS SO SCARED,
THINKING,"OH, MY GOD, WHAT ARE THEY GONNA SAY?
and...
they CAME BACK SO AMAZED
and SO HAPPY, AND THEY REALIZED
that THERE'S SOMETHING HERE, YOU KNOW.
and THEY'VE BEEN SUPPORTIVE EVER SINCE.
it SORT OF STARTED SLOWLY THROUGHOUT THE YEARS
to BECOME CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS
is WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WHEN I GROW UP.
I WANT TO BE A DESIGNER.
so RAMI, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOUR COLLECTION.
I'm VERY EXCITED. I'D LOVE TO SHOW YOU.
my STUDIO'S VERY CLOSE BY IN SILVER LAKE, SO, UH
wonderful. I'LL DRIVE!
Yeah, PERFECT. LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT.
Jeff, IT'S SO LOVELY TO SEE YOU.
thank YOU SO MUCH. PLEASURE.
Jen, WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU TOO.
thank YOU.
welcome TO MY STUDIO.
Wow! LOOK AT THIS SPACE!
this IS PHENOMENAL.
thank YOU. THANK YOU.
and THIS IS THE COLLECTION.
I WILL HAVE TO START BY TELLING YOU A LITTLE BIT
about THE INSPIRATION.
I WANT TO HEAR ALL ABOUT THE CONTEXT.
it's JOAN OF ARC.
it's A COMBINATION OF CONSTRUCTION AND DETAILS
yet IN MORE MODERN SENSE.
so THIS IS THE FIRST ONE.
and IT'S A CAPE THAT'S GOING TO COME OFF
and THEN YOU HAVE THIS BLOUSE.
I'm REALLY CRAZY ABOUT THIS LOOK.
AND--I JUST-- I'M SPEAKING THIS WAY
because I CA ENORMOUSLY ABOUT YOU. NO
of COURSE.
for ME, THESE OTHER PIECES
are LOOKING SO...
in A WAY, KIND OF HAMMERED AND NAILED.
I DON'T SEE THE-- I DON'T FEEL THE SAME SOFTNESS.
and THEN THIS WEIGHS ABOUT AS MUCH AS CHAIN MAIL WOULD.
Yes. YOU KNOW?
I WANT YOU TO PULL IT BACK A BIT.
he MADE SOME POINTS THAT I AGREE WITH.
and SOME OTHER ONES I WANT TO HOLD OFF ON
and JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE COLLECTION AND DECIDE.
but IN THE END, I NEED TO BELIEVE
in WHAT I'M DOING.
I HAVE NOTHING BUT CONFIDENCE IN YOU, YOU KNOW THAT.
thank YOU, TIM. I REALLY, REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
all RIGHT? ALL RIGHT.
but WHATEVER'S MEANT TO HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN.
thank YOU. THANK YOU.
Bye-bye. BYE.
finally, I'LL VISIT CHRIS MARCH,
who's ALSO WORKING ON HIS COLLECTION IN NEW YORK CITY.
Chris, IT'S TIM GUNN.
Hey! HEY.
how ARE YOU? COME ON IN.
I'm THRILLED TO SEE YOU.
good TO SEE YOU. COME ON IN.
it WAS GREAT TO SEE TIM AFTER SO LONG,
because WATCHING HIM ON TV, IT'S LIKE, "OH, I MISS TIM.
come ON IN. WOW.
this IS GREAT SPACE.
I KNOW.
I GOT REALLY LUCKY GETTING THIS SPACE.
I LOVE IT. THIS IS GREAT.
I THINK MY OBSTACLE SINCE COMING ON THE SHOW
so?
what's THE OVERALL INSPIRATION?
beauty WITH A QUIRK.
95% FASHION.
and 5% COSTUME THROWN IN.
all RIGHT.
this IS THIS CROCHETED HAIRPIN LACE.
this IS BEAUTIFUL.
it's A GORGEOUS COLOR, TOO.
Yeah.
all RIGHT, SO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THIS?
which IS THE USE OF HUMAN HAIR.
as TRIM. REALLY?
I KNEW YOU'D HAVE THAT FACE.
my GAG REFLEX IS KICKING IN.
you're USING HUMAN HAIR?
it's HAIR.
this IS-- THIS IS JUST
it's NOT
so YOU JUST THINK TAKE IT OFF?
see HOW MUCH MORE BELIEVABLE THIS IS?
I CAN TAKE IT OFF REALLY EASY.
it's SO MUCH MORE BELIEVABLE.
cause I FIGURED HE PROBABLY WOULD BE.
you WANNA LOOK AT THIS ONE? YEAH.
Oh, CHRIS!
I LOVE THE HAIR.
[Giggling] I CAN TAKE IT OFF.
Oh, BOY.
when YOU FIRST ENTER INTO THE MONKEY HOUSE AT THE ZOO,
you THINK,"OH, MY GOD, THIS PLACE STINKS!"
and AFTER YOU'RE THERE FOR 20 MINUTES,
you THINK, "THAT'S NOT SO BAD."
[Chris laughs] AND AFTER YOU'RE THERE FOR AN HOUR,
it DOESN'T SMELL AT ALL.
but ANYBODY ELSE COMING INTO THE MONKEY HOUSE,
FRESHLY, THINKS, "OH, MY GOD, THIS STINKS."
okay...
you've BEEN LIVING IN THE MONKEY HOUSE.
all RIGHT, I GET IT.
tim GAVE ME SOME IDEAS ABOUT EDITING,
but THERE'S DEFINITELY STILL GONNA BE SOME HAIR.
and SAY, "WE REALLY WANNA SEE MORE."
right.
have THEM BEGGING.
so I WANTED TO TAKE YOU OVER
to ONE OF MY FRIENDS' HOUSES TO MEET SOME OF MY FRIENDS.
kind OF MY NEW YORK FAMILY. OH, I'D LOVE TO.
let's GO. OFF WE GO.
I'm GONNA BRING TIM OVER TO MY FRIEND LARRY'S HOUSE.
and EVERYTHING YOU'LL SEE IN THERE
he's BUILT IN THERE.
so GLAD TO SEE YOU.
I've HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOUR PLACE, AND I SEE WHY.
this IS FANTASTIC.
great, WELCOME.
Oh, MY GOD.
it's VERSAILLES, IT'S THE SISTINE CHAPEL.
you HAVE EVERYTHING!
this IS STAGGERING. I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE.
thank YOU SO MUCH.
come IN AND MEET MY FRIENDS.
my FRIEND NELSON
and MY FRIENDS RAMONA AND ERIC
but I GREW UP MOSTLY IN THE BAY AREA.
and I HAVE FOUR OLDER BROTHERS.
to THEM, BEING ON PROJECT RUNWAY
was JUST, LIKE, ANOTHER THING CHRIS IS DOING, YOU KNOW.
Yeah, HE WALKS DOWN THE STREET IN DRAG.
Yeah, HE'S ON TV.
Yeah, WE'RE USED TO IT.
the THING THAT GOT ME REALLY INTO COSTUME
was I WENT TO A BIG COSTUME CONTEST
in SAN FRANCISCO, AND I WON.
and I WENT HOME AND I THOUGHT, "YOU KNOW, I REALLY WANT TO DO THIS FOR A LIVING.
I ENDED UP WITH A VERY SUCCESSFUL COSTUME CAREER
so I MOVED TO NEW YORK.
well, I'LL BE HONEST.
I WATCH THE SHOW BECAUSE OF YOU AND HEIDI.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW CHRIS WAS THERE.
we're CRAZY ABOUT HIM.
and HE REALLY DOES ADD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
to THAT SHOW. OH, THE OTHER NIGHT,
this GUY COMES UP TO ME, AND HE'S HOLDING
something IN HIS HANDS.
and I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA ASK ME FOR DIRECTIONS.
and HE FLIPS IT OPEN AND IT'S A POLICE BADGE.
and HE SAYS,"EXCUSE ME, SIR, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST."
what?
and I WAS LIKE,"WHAT?
and HE SAYS, "FOR BEING THE BEST DESIGNER ON PROJECT RUNWAY."
having TO SHOW THREE PIECES
and US COMPETE FOR THE FINAL SPOT AT FASHION WEEK,
I HOPE THAT THEY CHOOSE ME BECAUSE...
the REASON THAT I GOT INTO DOING WHAT I DO
is TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY, AND TO, YOU KNOW,
add SOME LAUGHTER AND FUN INTO THE WORLD.
and I JUST-- I LOVE DOING IT,
and I LOVE THAT IT MAKES PEOPLE HAPPY.
he's PRECIOUS.
he IS INDEED.
good-bye, TIM. HAVE A GREAT HOLIDAY.
Bye, TIM.
thank YOU. BYE-BYE. BYE NOW.
well, THAT WENT PRETTY WELL.
coming UP ON PROJECT RUNWAY...
[Christian muttering] ARE YOU GONNA BE NICE TO ME?
are YOU GONNA BE NICE TO ME?
here's THE DAY, AND IT'S NOW.
I JUST LEFT LOS ANGELES,
and MIXED EMOTIONS ARE GOING THROUGH ME.
I'm EXCITED, BUT I'M NERVOUS.
because I'M NOT SURE
if I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY SHOW MY COLLECTION.
so IT--IT'S A WEIRD PLACE TO BE.
Oh. PFFT.
having ANTICIPATED THIS THREE-PIECE, LIKE,"WALK-OFF"
since THE DAY WE LEFT...
it HAS BEEN QUITE A THING TO GO FROM BEING ELIMINATED
to BEING BACK ON,
to BEING PART OF THE FINAL FOUR.
so COULD I POSSIBLY WIN?
we'll HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
Wow.
this IS AS BIG AS MY FIRST APARTMENT.
it's VERY NERVE-WRACKING, BEING BACK
after MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS OF WORK.
Ooh.
isn't THIS PRETTY INSIDE?
I THINK MY COLLECTION'S REALLY STRONG.
I'm PRETTY CONFIDENT WITH IT.
I MEAN, I LOVE IT. 'CAUSE I'M SO FIERCE.
diva.
you BROUGHT A PLANT?
are YOU GONNA BE NICE TO ME?
are YOU GONNA BE NICE TO ME?
love YOU, MEAN IT.
your HAIR LOOKS GOOD.
I WAS LIKE,"OH, GOD.
he's FUN 'S RLLIK
been A HUGE FAN OF MINE.
so THIS COULD REALLY TURN OUT NASTY.
Uh-oh.
Hi. HEY.
how YOU?
it's GOOD TO SEE YOU.
bed HERE, AND THERE'S TWO BEDS IN THERE.
I PUT MY STUFF IN THERE.
so YOU FINISHED YOUR COLLECTION LIKE LAST MONTH, RIGHT?
[Laughs] OR THE MONTH BEFORE?
no.
I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT EVERYBODY DID.
me TOO.
I'm SCARED.
Oh...
Hey!
Oh, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU GUYS.
it WAS LOTS OF FUN TO SEE EVERYBODY TOGETHER.
no MATTER WHAT'S HAPPENED, WE ALL REALLY LIKE EACH OTHER,
and WE ALL GET ALONG.
so IT WAS KINDA LIKE A LITTLE FAMILY REUNION.
Cheers.
you KNOW, PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE ME
when I SAY THAT I MISS YOU.
they're LIKE, "HE'S SO ANNOYING!
I'm LIKE, "BUT HE'S NOT REALLY.
don't WORRY, PEOPLE SAY THE SAME ABOUT YOU.
How've YOU BEEN?
stressed.
Really?
like A NIGHTMARE WITCH.
I UNDERSTAND.
we're SITTING THERE
and WE'RE HANGING OUT WITH THEM,
kicking BACK, CATCHING UP.
and I'M THINKING,HMM.
I JUST WONDER WHO'S GOING TO END UP
on THAT THIRD BED UPSTAIRS WITH JILLIAN AND CHRISTIAN.
are YOU GUYS EXCITED?
I'm NOT EXCITED.
more LIKE-- [strangled noise]
we'll HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.
we WAKE UP IN THE MORNING.
and IT'S WEIRD,
because WE'RE JUST SORT OF LIKE WAITING TO SEE
what's GONNA HAPPEN.
we DON'T KNOW WHEN THE JUDGES
are GOING TO WANT TO SEE OUR THREE STRONGEST LOOKS.
this IS YOURS, RIGHT?
Yeah, THAT'S ONE OF 'EM.
you KNOW, IT'S LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN,
it ALL BECAME VERY REAL.
here's THE DAY, AND IT'S NOW.
Ooh! OH, ISN'T THIS PRETTY.
Oh, LOOK AT THIS.
there's ONLY THREE TABLES.
we'll SHARE. YEAH, WE'LL SHARE.
I WON'T.
seeing THAT THERE WERE ONLY THREE TABLES
was A LITTLE BIT CHILLING.
thus BRINGING HOME THE POINT
that ONE OF US WON'T BE THERE.
and, LIKE, THIS IS REALLY GONNA HAPPEN.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE EVERYONE'S STUFF.
Oh MY DEAR LORD.
I WISH ALL OF THESE SHOES
were FOR ME.
Hi, EVERYBODY.
Hey! HOW ARE YOU?
how ARE YOU? I'VE MISSED YOU.
we MISSED YOU.
so CAN I ASK YOU TO GATHER ROUND, PLEASE?
first, I WANT TO CONGRATULATE ALL OF YOU
for MAKING IT THIS FAR.
it's FANTASTIC.
and I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU OF WHAT AN INCREDIBLE
and SINGULAR EXPERIENCE IT IS
to BE PRESENTING YOUR WORK ON THE LARGEST STAGE
in THE FASHION INDUSTRY.
talk ABOUT A WOW MOMENT.
as YOU KNOW, ONLY ONE OF YOU WILL MAKE IT THERE.
as HEIDI SAID WHEN WE LAST PARTED,
you MUST CHOOSE THE THREE STRONGEST LOOKS
from YOUR COLLECTION
and PRESENT THEM TO THE JUDGES,
who IN TURN WILL DECIDE WHICH ONE OF YOU
will BE MOVING FORWARD.
we've ASSIGNED YOU MODELS.
you WILL HAVE THREE HOURS TO FIT THEM,
bring THEM THROUGH HAIR AND MAKEUP.
shoes HAVE BEEN GENEROUSLY PROVIDED
by BLUEFLY. COM.
and IF YOU HAVE ANY LAST-MINUTE ALTERATIONS,
we HAVE BROTHER SEWING STATIONS SET UP FOR YOU TO USE.
owing TO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO
in SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME,
I WANT EACH OF YOU TO CHOOSE A PARTNER.
one OF US?
Jillian! YES! WHO ELSE COULD IT BE?
we're THE BROTHER AND SISTER ACT.
rami AND CHRIS, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
regardless OF THE OUTCOME OF TODAY,
I AM SO EXTRAORDINARILY PROUD OF EACH OF YOU.
and I JUST WANT YOU
to GO OUT THERE AND KNOCK THOSE JUDGES'
socks OFF.
but JUST HAVE AN INCREDIBLSHOWING, OKAY?
thank YOU.
all RIGHT. LADIES, HI.
come IN.
do YOU WANT TO FIT THEM, JILLIAN?
and I GUESS ONE OF YOU COULD TRY THIS.
I LOVE THIS COLOR.
there SHOULD BE ONE PAIR
of LIKE SIZE 10 SHOES.
it WAS DIFFICULT TO SELECT JUST THREE PIECES.
but I KIND OF CAME TO THE CONCLUSION
I WOULD CHOOSE FROM ONE COLOR CATEGORY.
the BLACK, BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS THE STRONGEST.
you PICKED YOUR THREE LOOKS, RIGHT?
Yeah.
let's DO A HEEL, AND LET ME JUST SEE YOU WALK IN THIS.
back IN LOS ANGELES, I DECIDED
that I WOULD SHOW
three DIFFERENT ELEMENTS-- CONSTRUCTION,
ethereal, AND SORT OF DRAMATIC.
and THEN A DRAPING.
Where's THE...
sorry, I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M ALL OVER THE PLACE.
it's OKAY.
give ME AS MUCH TO DO AS YOU CAN.
I'm FEELING SO--IT'S HOT.
we HAVE SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
for HAIR AND MAKEUP, TO FIT OUR MODELS,
do ALTERATIONS.
jewelry. [bleep].
it's A LOT OF PRESSURE, I THINK,
because IT'S JUST THE ANTICIPATION OF THAT MOMENT,
that BIG MOMENT THAT WE'VE BOTH WAITED FOR.
how's it going, Christian?
it's GOING GOOD, JILLIAN.
I MISS YOU.
don't TALK TO HER!
I CAN'T TALK TO THE
do YOU HAVE A PIN? THE COMPETITION?
here COMES THE HAIR.
that LOOKS SO...
[bleep]IN' FUNNY.
Chris's WORK WAS VERY INTERESTING
when I FIRST SAW IT.
I HAD BROUGHT MY BRUSH.
did YOU?
Yes.
looked VERY INNOVATIVE.
and THERE WAS HAIR ON IT.
he WAS LIKE, "DO YOU WANNA BRUSH THE DRESS?"
and I'M LIKE,"OKAY."
God.
are YOU JOKING RIGHT NOW?
don't GET IT ON THE FLOOR!
I PICKED IT UP.
so VERY CLEAN, VERY TIGHT PONYTAIL.
very SLICKED BACK.
wavy AND MESSY.
thank YOU.
I WOULD LIKE EMPHASIS
on JUST THE EYE.
very DARK AND STRANGE.
like DARK LIPS.
thank YOU VERY MUCH.
have A GOOD DAY.
I THINK THAT MY THREE LOOKS CAME TOGETHER REALLY WELL.
so THE WHOLE IDEA
of ACTUALLY MAKING IT TO BRYANT PARK IS LIKE, "COULD THIS REALLY HAPPEN?"
it's LIKE,"WOW.
I THINK IT ACTUALLY COULD.
I HAVE TO ADJUST ALL THIS.
we BOTH HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
I HAVE BUTTERFLIES IN MY STOMACH.
and I HOPE THAT I GET TO SHOW IN FASHION WEEK.
but I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
when YOU POSE, THEN YOU CAN DO THIS.
okay, THERE WE GO.
Oh, GOD.
time's UP.
off TO PARSONS.
coming UP ON PROJECT RUNWAY...
it IS HUMAN HAIR.
Yes.
it's JUST REALLY UNFLATTERING.
hello.
Hi.
welcome BACK TO THE RUNWAY.
as YOU KNOW, THE TWO OF YOU ARE HERE
to COMPETE
for THE FINAL SPOT AT NEW YORK FASHION WEEK.
we ASKED YOU TO CHOOSE THE THREE STRONGEST LOOKS
from YOUR COLLECTIONS
for US TO JUDGE.
these LOOKS WILL DETERMINE
which ONE OF YOU WILL MOVE ON
and WHICH ONE OF YOU WILL BE OUT.
okay, LET'S MEET THE JUDGES.
first WE HAVE
top AMERICAN DESIGNER MICHAEL KORS.
Hi, EVERYONE.
and THE LOVELY NINA GARCIA,
fashion DIRECTOR OF ELLE MAGAZINE.
good LUCK.
we BELIEVE IN BOTH OF YOU,
and THIS IS WHY WE GAVE YOU THIS OPPORTUNITY.
so WE HOPE THAT YOU BLOW US AWAY
with YOUR WORK.
good LUCK.
and LET'S START THE SHOW.
I've EXPERIMENTED WITH NEW TECHNIQUES
that I HAVE NOT DONE BEFORE.
I've MADE A POINT THAT I CAN DO MORE
than JUST DRAPE.
I'm PROUD OF THE COLLECTION.
it's FEMININE, IT'S STRONG.
it CELEBRATES A WOMAN'S BODY.
I'm EXCITED, BUT I'M NERVOUS.
because I WANT TO SHOW MY COLLECTION AT BRYANT PARK.
I THINK MY COLLECTION EXPRESSES WHO I AM
as A FASHION DESIGNER.
it's ACTUALLY VERY SOPHISTICATED.
and SLEEK AND DARING AND DARK.
it's WHAT I THINK OF AS BEING BEAUTIFUL.
that WHOLE KIND OF LIKE THE DARK SIDE OF BEAUTY.
so I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH WHAT I CAME UP WITH.
it WAS PRETTY EXCITING TO FINALLY SEE SOMETHING
come DOWN THAT RUNWAY
that I HAVE HAD SOME TIME TO MAKE.
and THAT I THINK WAS A REAL REFLECTION
of THE WAY THAT I WORK AND MY CREATIVITY.
we've SCORED YOUR DESIGNS.
one OF YOU WILL BE GOING TO FASHION WEEK.
and ONE OF YOU
will BE OUT.
let's BRING OUT YOUR MODELS.
Chris, TELL US A LITTLE BIT
about YOUR INSPIRATION.
my INSPIRATION WAS KIND OF A DARK GLAMOUR GOTH.
and I TRIED TO INCORPORATE
some UNEXPECTED MATERIALS.
is THAT THE, UM...
fake FUR?
is IT GOAT?
no, IT'S-- IT'S HUMAN HAIR.
it IS HUMAN HAIR.
Yes.
I LIKED IT BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE DARK,
a LITTLE CREEPY, A LITTLE GOTH.
I LIKED IT. WELL, I HAVE TO SAY,
you KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.
it's A LITTLE CREEPY, AS YOU SAID,
for HER TO WEAR-- TO WEAR HUMAN HAIR.
but-- I KNOW, THAT'S WHAT
but YOU THOUGHT OUTSIDE OF THE BOX.
and THEN WHAT IS THE SKIRT ON THE FIRST SUIT MADE OF?
that's ANOTHER THING.
the SKIRT IS MADE OUT OF BLACK CHROME SAFETY PINS.
safety PINS.
I CAN JUST TELL YOU,
each ROW TOOK ABOUT EIGHT HOURS.
I THINK THAT THAT'S
beautifully CRAFTED.
on THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN,
I THINK THAT THE GIRLS
look OVERLY DESIGNED AND DARK.
particularly WHEN I GOT TO THIS GOWN.
she CAN'T MOVE IN IT. WHICH IS A PROBLEM.
Yeah.
I MEAN, YOU'RE IN A VELVET CONDOM.
I MEAN, IT'S
Yeah.
so THAT REALLY BOTHERED ME.
but THE WORK THAT WENT INTO IT'S
pretty REMARKABLE.
I THINK THE CLOTHES LOOK TERRIFIC.
I LOVE THE SAFETY PINS.
even THE HUMAN HAIR, ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SO SURE
if I COULD-- I WOULD WEAR IT.
but IT CAN GO OVERBOARD.
I WANT TO KNOW WHY
did YOU PICK THESE 3 OUTFITS
from 12?
I THOUGHT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE BEST IDEA TO CHOOSE
three THINGS FROM ONE OF THE COLOR SECTIONS.
and I THOUGHT THE BLACK ONES
were THE MOST DRAMATIC.
everything IS LIKE A SPECIAL, UNIQUE PIECE
that I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE.
it DEFINITELY IS VERY CREATIVE.
thank YOU.
why DO YOU DESERVE TO GO TO FASHION WEEK?
I THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING
to HAVE A POINT OF VIEW FROM OUTSIDE THE FASHION WORLD.
personally, I THINK MY HEAD
would JUST BLOW OFF.
I DON'T KNOW.
what WAS YOUR INSPIRATION?
I WANTED TO SHOW THAT I'M ABLE TO CONSTRUCT.
and I NEEDED TO FIND THAT BALANCE
between WHAT I'VE CREATED ON THE SHOW
and THE LAST THINGS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE SAID.
and I'VE TAKEN ALL OF THESE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION,
including TIM'S VISIT, AND I HOPE THAT THAT CAME THROUGH.
I APPRECIATE THE FACT
that YOU LISTENED,
and THAT YOU INCORPORATED SOME THINGS THAT WERE MORE
tailored.
I PARTICULARLY LIKED YOUR SECOND LOOK.
Oh, THANK YOU.
can I SEE THE DRESS BY ITSELF?
Yeah, OF COURSE.
I MEAN, IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFULLY DONE
with THE PLACEMENT, AND THE EFFECT IS FANTASTIC.
thank YOU.
it LOOKS EFFORTLESS.
and I HAVE A FEELING IT IS WORKED.
that DIDN'T, LIKE, JUST
whoosh ONTO THE, YOU KNOW, DRESS FORM LIKE THAT.
you're SITTING THERE AND DRAPING THAT BEAUTIFULLY.
I WORRY ABOUT THE PROPORTION, A LITTLE BIT, OF YOUR COAT.
I THINK WITH THE COLLAR,
the LITTLE CAPULET SLEEVE, THEN THE PLEATING,
that's A LOT OF VOLUME IN ONE COAT.
Yeah.
in TERMS OF BEING A CUSTOMER,
I WOULD WEAR, LIKE, THE EVENING DRESS.
it's GORGEOUSLY MADE.
but THEN THOSE ROUND THINGS ON HER HIPS?
are JUST REALLY UNFLATTERING.
I DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.
it IS A FANTASY DRESS.
it IS A FANTASY.
but BOTH OF YOU HAVE A VERY DARK
inspiration.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
why DO YOU DESERVE TO GO TO FASHION WEEK?
I MEAN, THIS IS... WHO I AM.
this HAS BEEN MY CALLING
since I WAS SIX YEARS OLD.
so I THINK THAT GOING TO FASHION WEEK,
for ME, COULD BE A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY
that CAN SHOWCASE MY WORK TO A LARGE AUDIENCE
so THAT NEW DOORS COULD OPEN AFTERWARDS.
okay, WE'VE HEARD WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY.
we're GONNA HAVE A LITTLE CHAT.
and THEN I'M GONNA CALL YOU BACK.
you CAN LEAVE THE RUNWAY. THANK YOU.
so WHAT DID YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT THE SHOW?
both OF THEM WERE SO...
dark.
obviously THEY WANTED TO SHOW SOMETHING VERY DRAMATIC.
and I THINK THINGS GOT
overly DESIGNED, OVERLY COMPLICATED.
but I THINK THAT THERE WAS A LOT
of INGENUITY AND A LOT OF CRAFT
that WENT INTO THESE CLOTHES WE SAW.
so WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT RAMI?
with RAMI, THERE'S A SUBSTANCE THERE.
it's ORGANIC.
Yes, THERE IS A SKILL.
I THOUGHT THAT MIDDLE DRESS WAS BEAUTIFUL.
me TOO.
I MEAN, I COULD NAME 25 WOMEN
who WOULD WANT TO OWN THAT DRESS.
I WOULD. THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S
some COMMERCIAL VIABILITY TO WHAT HE'S DOING.
the EVENING DRESS I LIKED TOO.
but THE SIDE BITS? NO.
I LIKED IT.
I HAD MORE OF A PROBLEM
with THE COAT, BECAUSE IT LOOKED OVERDONE.
he's TRYING TO INCORPORATE SOMETHING TAILORED.
so MY HAT'S OFF THAT HE TRIED IT.
you KNOW WHAT, AND I APPRECIATE THAT HE LISTENED.
we WERE VERY CONCERNED THAT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE
one GRECIAN GODDESS AFTER THE OTHER.
and HE DIDN'T.
and WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT CHRIS?
when YOU THINK ABOUT
that HE TOOK HUMAN HAIR,
safety PINS, PENNE VELVET,
made IT LOOK LIKE FUR.
reworked THE WHOLE THING.
and TAILORED IT BEAUTIFULLY.
and WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT,
I WASN'T REALLY SURE WHAT ANY OF IT WAS.
and THAT'S KIND OF INTRIGUING.
Yeah.
he WAS VERY PROUD TO SAY
that IT WAS HAIR EXTENSIONS.
Yes, HUMAN HAIR.
[imitating Chris] IT'S HUMAN HAIR,
and IT'S MAYBE A LITTLE DARK, A LITTLE GOTH.
but I THINK THAT CHRIS
is STILL GIVING US COSTUMES.
but YOU KNOW WHAT?
there HAVE BEEN MANY FANTASTIC DESIGNERS
that HAVE STARTED OFF AS COSTUME DESIGNERS
and HAVE BUILT A BUSINESS
on THIS.
we KNOW WHAT WE WANT TO DO?
Yeah, I THINK SO.
okay. LET'S BRING THEM BACK OUT.
one OF YOU WILL BE OUT.
one OF YOU WILL GOING TO FASHION WEEK...
and ONE OF YOU WILL BE OUT.
you MADE THIS A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION.
our CRITICISM OF BOTH OF YOUR THREE LOOKS
is THAT THEY FELT DARK
and OVERWORKED.
but HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.
Chris, YOU SHOWED US HOW INCREDIBLY CREATIVE YOU ARE.
you SHOWED US SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
and A REFINED POINT OF VIEW.
Congratulations.
you're GOING TO NEW YORK FASHION WEEK.
thank YOU SO MUCH.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
and, UM, I'M... VERY EXCITED TO SHOW.
I'm SORRY, CHRIS.
that MEANS YOU'RE OUT.
you're AN INCREDIBLE DESIGNER.
and WE LOVED HAVING YOU HERE.
thank YOU SO MUCH.
auf WIEDERSEHEN.
I'm SO THRILLED TO HAVE MADE IT THIS FAR.
and THIS HAS BEEN SUCH AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE.
thank YOU SO MUCH.
so WHAT'S UP, TRANNIES?
I'm IN.
you ARE?
AND...YEAH.
and YOU?
out. SORRY.
it's... ARE YOU OKAY?
Yes.
I'm SO HAPPY FOR RAMI, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW.
Yeah.
it's HIS WHOLE LIFE.
I WISH WE BOTH COULD GO TO FASHION WEEK.
but I'M VERY PROUD, AND I'M VERY HAPPY,
and IT'S NICE TO NOW KNOW
that I WILL BE SHOWING MY COLLECTION
at FASHION WEEK.
you TWO BETTER WATCH OUT FOR THAT.
[Laughing] THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.
so.
Chris, AS HEIDI SAID, YOU ARE
an INCREDIBLE DESIGNER.
Oh!
you KNOW WHAT, TIM?
this HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
the DAY I SET FOOT IN THE DOOR AT PROJECT RUNWAY.
Bye, CHRIS. BYE.
Bye. LOVE YOU.
what I REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT
was THE AMOUNT OF LOVE
that THE UNIVERSE SENT MY WAY.
would I DO IT AGAIN?
[small voice] YEAH.
coming UP ON PROJECT RUNWAY...
you LOOK NERVOUS. I AM.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING.
the show is tomorrow...
...and it's gonna be very hard to pull in another girl.
she's NEVER DONE A CASTING BEFORE.
whatever. IT'S HER OWN FAULT.
can YOU FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE?
no.
here IT IS. BRYANT PARK.
now IT'S LIKE THE END OF THE ROAD,
and THAT'S THE REWARD.
this IS IT, GUYS.
Oh, I'M OVER THESE GIRLS.
where ARE MY TWO GIRLS?
I WAS LIKE READY TO GIVE UP.
you OKAY?
you GUYS, THIS IS SO UNFAIR.
Hello, EVERYBODY. [cheers and applause]
visit BRAVOTV. COM
to LEARN MORE ABOUT THE FASHIONS YOU'VE SEEN ON TODAY'S SHOW.
this is the destination of your first challenge.
Oh, my gosh!
to get all these grocery store items on this garment.
Whackadoodle!
Oh, my god, this is the worst fabric.
I don't know what I'm doing.
you definitely need a wow factor.
the biggest fear is losing out on the first round.
congratulations, Kelli. - Thank you
you're the winner of this challenge,
and you will also have immunity and you cannot be eliminated.
it's freaky.
I am not impressed.
Jerry, you're out.
the winner of project runway will receive a 2009 saturn vue hybrid, an opportunity to sell their line on bluefly.com, and $100, 000 to start their own line furnished by tresemme professional hair care.
this is project runway.
I think reality has set in for me.
my roommate, Jerry, was voted out.
this is a competition, so any decision that's not suede going home is the right decision.
but I totally didn't expect that.
it's got spirulina, alfalfa, barley grass, cut grass, juice, powder.
why do we believe him When he says we're supposed to drink this crap?
Cheers.
Oh, my god, I'm still here.
thank god.
it's a serious competition.
and there's truly no messing around here.
I'm not a cow. I don't like grass.
but I'm drinking it.
you guys ready to go to Parsons?
I'm definitely excited about having immunity.
I'm definitely innovative and creative, and I definitely expected to win that challenge.
here we go. Here we go.
let's go, let's go.
let's get this show on the road.
delicious and nutritious.
hello.
Hi, Heidi.
okay, before we talk about your next challenge, let's bring out your models.
models, this is a competition for you, too.
the model paired with the winner designer will receive A fashion spread in elle magazine.
okay, for the first challenge, we assigned you girls.
but now we're gonna let you choose.
Kelli, you were the winner of the first challenge, so you get first pick.
who's it gonna be?
I would love to stay with Germaine.
and the next one is Joe.
I've decided to go with Topacio.
I mean, she looks like a million bucks.
I'm gonna stay with Leslie.
I'll go ahead and stick with Runa.
I'd like Alex.
Jennifer snatches up my model.
what am I gonna do?
I am salty!
I'm gonna stick with Zaviera, there we go.
that means Leanne, you have the last pick.
bell and Karalyn, one of you will be out.
Leanne, who is it gonna be?
I'm really sorry, Bell,
but karalyn, you're awesome, so I have to stick with you.
I'm sorry, Bell. That means you're out.
auf wiedersehen.
thank you.
okay, before I give you your next challenge, let's bring out your new models.
what's goin' on?
it's a little suspicious.
I hope you're happy with your new models, because for your next challenge, they will be your clients, and you will be making a cocktail dress for them.
I'm stoked. this is gonna be great.
I love Polina. She's golden.
we're going to send all of you into the workroom
where Tim is waiting to fill you in on all the details.
good luck, and I'll see you on the runway.
Tchuss. Let's go, ladies.
designers and models, may I ask you to gather around, please?
as Heidi said, for this challenge, your models will serve as your clients for a cocktail dress.
this challenge is about the young, glamorous woman.
what Heidi didn't tell you is that you will be using green fabrics for your dress, environmentally responsible textiles.
cool. - Yeah. very cool.
a green fabric is a natural textile, bamboo, hemp, jersey.
I always use green materials.
it's just a lot gentler for the environment.
and there's more...
and it's a project runway first.
your models will do the shopping.
Oh! oh!
Oh, great.
I'm gonna have somebody that probably doesn't know much about fabrics to begin with. Go pick me out some fabric.
you've got taste, right?
okay.
you'd better get some good stuff.
my designer is Kenley, and it was like, you're gonna have this model shop for my fabric?
you gotta be kidding me. Her face was just like complete disgust.
Oh, my god.
models, you have a budget of $75.
designers, stay put.
so models, follow me right now.
we're going.
we have no control over what they're choosing, and I'm screaming to Leslie as she's running for the door, "don't forget closures!"
zippers, buttons, elastic!
work it out, girls, work it out.
good luck, ladies! bye!
you have half an hour to shop.
and your time starts...
now! - Oh! oh!
Oh, my god, I'm so nervous.
can you show me where Some of the more organic fabrics are?
all of these? wow.
so all of these with the ties?
is there anything more, like, silky?
we were pretty much all running around like chickens with our heads cut off, like, trying to figure out which color would look good with this in trims and how much we needed.
I had no idea.
I'm looking for, like, color though.
how much is a yard?
you wanna see what else we have? - yeah.
I have absolutely no idea what I'm gonna grab.
I know absolutely nothing about fashion design.
just two of this.
what about this?
a lot of the girls will have the same material.
that's gonna be a challenge for the designers, because they gotta make it look different.
I want some of this. - Okay
perfect. Oh, that's so pretty.
that's perfect. - Yeah, that's perfect.
I'm not really thinking what my designer may possibly like.
Yeah, just-- just cut it for me.
I kept in mind what I liked and what would look good on me.
a dollar?
I found some really cool peacock feathers, so whatever will match that is what I'm looking for.
I really like the deep rich color, you know?
I'm kinda worried. Leslie got the same fabric.
there's something, like, I forgot.
right, same here. same here.
models, time's up.
wow, 30 minutes goes fast, doesn't it?
all right, let's go back to Parsons.
thank you. - Thank you, Mood!
you're an enthusiastic bunch.
designers, your models and I are back.
my biggest fear is that she's gonna come back with remnants of nonsense.
you will have half an hour to caucus with your model.
and you will have until midnight tonight To complete your cocktail dress.
all right, I am sending in your models.
Yay. Nothing raggedy.
ladies, come on in.
all right.
um... This I can't use.
how many yardage did you get?
I'm a little freaked out because one of the fabrics was this jersey-knit, hot pink fabric.
Jersey is just not right for a cocktail dress.
this is jersey fabric.Tthis is t-shirt.
did everyone get something different?
let's see...
the colors, the champagne color and a light peach color.
those two fabrics don't really go together.
I'm trying to think of a way that we could layer these on top of that, she got me peacock feathers.
what am I gonna do with peacock feathers and peacock trim?
Yes! Oh!
we got this, boo-boo.
you better do it, girl.
and some thread and everything.
you did so good!
do you know what this is, what kind of fabric?
it's silk. - silk.
I don't really like the fabrics that my model chose.
she brought this disgusting green color along with brown, and just I don't think the two of them are gonna work together.
how much is here? how many yards is this? - 2.
I just wish I had more fabric, and fabric that was a little more forgiving.
nothing. - Very sexy, sexy.
and the zipper will just be zip!
so do you want fullness? Is that what you want?
there's a really nice silk and hemp blend as well as a red jersey.
maybe I start it in like a swirl or something over here?
Yeah.
there isn't a ton of green fashion, so I'm really trying to make it sexy, make it chic and still put Suede into it.
everything's super-short right now. - Not too short.
it has to be short, though.
there's a reason they're asking us To consult with our models, and it's not just to chit-chat.
it's to listen to what they like.
you can attach a piece of this as a drape, bcause this is gonna drape a lot.
kendall is a very earthy, organic kind of girl.
a low drape in the back, yes? - Yeah.
she wanted something beachy and free and flowy.
but that's not my design aesthetic.
I'm very urban, and that reflects in my design.
like I like form-fitted stuff, and that's what I do, like tough-looking stuff.
never, ever have I practiced
anything like this in my life.
Designers...
time is up.
models, I need you to leave with me right now.
this is the key words-- elegant and classy.
off we go.
I have absolutely no strategy.
I'm just confused.
this is not what I do.
coming up on project runway...
this is the outside of the dress.
Oh, this is the outside of the dress? - yeah.
I love the green aspect of this challenge.
the amount of dyes that the fashion industry pumps into the oceans and rivers of the world Is pretty gnarly.
and as a designer, I'd love to do whatever I can do to reduce that impact.
I hope Heidi likes it, that pink.
she said she likes bold, bright colors.
not only are our models our clients, but they get to pick out the fabric.
this is gonna be so pretty.
my model wants the dress to be girly but still kinda pretty, sophisticated.
with different color paneling on the side.
I have to prove myself to darth vader.
who's darth vader? - Heidi.
I call her darth licious. - Why's that?
because on the outside she's all like, you know, shiny and all like all put together.
but on the inside, she's crazy.
I just wish I had more yardage of the brown.
I know. I only got 2 yards.
I don't need the green. I don't think I'm gonna use it.
I'm really nervous only having one day for this challenge.
my model really wanted a very tailored cocktail dress, and satin shows every mistake.
I need more time to try out the materials and see what's actually feasible with them.
anyone doing a black dress? - mine.
you have the same black as me?
I like this black, though.
a lot of designers have the same fabric.
but we don't have to use all the fabrics.
so I went with this champagne colored organic silk.
it's just all about fit with this thing.
I love my girl.
Katrina, she's Puerto rican. I'm african.
women from these countries are shapely.
we have hips. We have butts.
so I wanted to do a dress that would enhance those features.
look at you, drapey draperson.
but I'm not.
I don't wanna do something I've never done before.
it'll look half-assed.
kendall wanted something flowy, and I'm not doing that.
I wanna do something like this, bcause she brought me this.
that's cool.
I'll make a really cool urban looking, you know, like me, tough.
this is what I do. I do like slick.
the judges need to know who I am as a designer, not what the model wants to wear that day
it'll be way different than that.
suede decided to cut up all these strips.
suede loves that.
and I take all these frickin' bias strips to the machine and start sewing.
it is going to be a long night for Suede.
Suede's a bisexual sagittarius and loves long walks on the beach and really loves working with small pieces of fabric.
suede likes to talk about himself in third person. - Doesn't Suede? - I know, I love that.
now I'm gonna go home and cry. Suede's really sad.
that's great, dude.
Suede's really sad.
Suede's gonna go home And cry all night long.
leanne likes Suede, but Suede needs to stop talking in third person.
Wesley, joe, and I all have the same fabric.
so in order to differentiate my design from either of theirs, I'm gonna create new shapes and add to my dress to make it stand out from the rest.
I was worried about Leanne.
leanne is doing all these circle things Hanging off of it.
it's starting to look like too much.
do I look sailorific?
I am pleased with how my outfit is coming along.
Leslie has a very clean, classic, all-american style, and I have a more funky, underground, edgy look.
so it'll be interesting to see how the two come together.
Oh, mother of god!
when I saw the pleating on Wesley's dress, I thought the pleating in his dress kinda looked similar to my dress.
so I kinda got concerned that possibly they might say our dresses look alike.
look at his dress.
yeah?
look at my dress.
like, what the hell?
I don't think it's the same thing.
it's the same concept.
I mean, am I paranoid, or do I have a valid point?
I don't think they look the same at all.
I'm being paranoid?
you really are. - Okay.
for people to be even looking at what other people are doing while they're working Is nonsense, because that distracts you and puts you on another road of, like, thought and process.
I think everybody should just Keep their eyes to their own design.
Hi, everybody.
Kenley, how are you? - Hi, Tim. Good.
this is what my model got me.
it's pretty.
and then she got me this big, huge belt, but I cut it down, and I'm gonna use the back and hand sew it to make it one continuous belt.
that gives it a hard edge.
she's got an edge but a very mature look.
are you concerned about time?
not really. - All right, good.
carry on, Kenley. thank you.
from what I can tell, this is gonna be a very pretty dress.
how does it have your mark in it?
the way the darts curl under here, and really the way it's gonna look like...
Yeah, but Korto, if this is right and works well, we're not gonna see those darts.
this is the outside of the dress.
Oh, this is the outside of the dress? - Yeah.
how about? - Now I get it.
these are all showing. - Yeah.
everything about this has to be perfection, or you're gonna be dealing with a hot mess.
I'm gonna leave you alone. Work, work, work, work.
Hey. - Hi. Talk to me.
I'm a little crazy.
crazy how?
crazy doin' strips. - Okay.
I have this to finish filling, and I have a tulle skirt that's gonna go down about here and then a circle skirt that goes over it.
okay. Are you concerned about time?
of course I'm concerned about time.
you need to follow your own vision and listen to your own voice.
but I'm really excited about this.
thank you. That means a lot.
Wesley. - Hi, Tim.
so talk to me about what you're doing.
I'm making a fitted cocktail dress for my model.
it's gonna have a cut out back here.
it's gonna snap here and have a zipper down the back.
just make certain that the fit is fantastic.
because if it isn't done perfectly, you know what's going to happen with those harsh runway lights.
everything's going to show.
okay. - All right. work hard, Wesley.
I will. - Thank you very much.
thank you.
Hi, Tim.
so you have the same fabric as Wesley. - I do.
it's a very different look, that's for sure.
so this is an arm hole?
uh, this goes over her shoulder.
okay. And what happens in the back?
I'm probably gonna do a few more of these like little floopy things.
I mean, I'll just say you have an awful lot going on.
so, I'm worried about you.
bring an editing eye to this.
don't force it.
just resolve it.
tim told me that I have a lot to think about, but I have so many ideas, and I just love the way that it looks.
so I'm willing to take the chance.
all right, everybody.
I have two important announcements to make.
there will be no immunity for this challenge.
instead, the winner will have their dress manufactured and sold by bluefly.com.
pretty thrilling, huh?
I'm actually okay with nobody getting immunity, because the prize that we're getting Is way better than immunity.
and since this challenge is about young, beautiful women, it's only fitting that one of hollywood's most glamorous young stars will be our guest judge.
and you'll find out who tomorrow.
it's important to make an impression on young hollywood, because those are ultimately who we want our clients to be.
I'm gonna leave you for the night.
the judges' expectations are extremely high.
in other words, the stakes couldn't be higher.
deadline is midnight, and I don't even have this garment covered with the strips.
I've got a lot of work to do.
coming up on project runway...
Daniel. - Yes.
you have five minutes. - Okay.
I'm hoping just to finish my garment.
we have 45 minutes.
I still have a lot of work to get done.
I'm hoping just to finish my garment.
everyone's kind of losing it.
everybody just really has a lot to do To get it done in time.
still got the hem to do.
everyone's trying to finish.
I'm very nervous at this point.
my model didn't necessarily pick the best organic materials for me to use.
and I think I'm psyching myself out.
this is brutal.
guess it's not just me having a crappy night.
12 minutes to 12, everybody.
so get your last stitch, your last zip.
this is ridiculous.
this is fabric that's like I never even go to shop for stuff like this.
I just wanna stick to my leather.
Oh, leatha.
she is so ridiculous!
what is she talking about?
Oh, she wished that every challenge was made of leather.
I wanna just sew leather.
burn it up, dye it up.
grommet it, pyramid it, stud it, spike it.
I wanna make my leather.
my cat's leatha.
I like to watch leatha TV.
I would make a leather dress like this, but it'd have a whole different vibe.
and my husband's leatha.
all my kids came outta me leatha.
they're all named leatha.
what are they saying?
they're making fun of you and your saying you make leather.
what, Blayne?
he's 12 years old! What does he know?
come here, Blayne wear your diapers.
wait, could you guys hear me in there?
I'm like who you talking about leather?
what do you know?
remove that piece of leather from the center of your teeth there.
you look like you got a gap tooth.
Oh, love your leather face.
I'm making Daniel's bed for him.
so I'm just taking care of it for him, bcause he's my buddy.
I feel confident about my garment, but I need to finish it.
that would be the most important thing, for you to finish it.
elimination day again, a lot of people are nervous.
we have to get this all done asap.
I have so much work to do.
Flashdance, come on.
Oh, how did that come undone?
I ripped the pull off my zipper after I put my zipper in.
do you know any way to get it back on?
I don't have any tricks.
I do need time to finish my garment.
it's gonna be cutting it to the very last second.
I'm gonna get a heart attack here.
people are really freakin' out.
zippers are breaking.
so it's kinda making me feel good, bcause I'm like, okay, at least I'm not like the only one that's somewhat worried.
how's it coming, Leanne?
I'm feeling really confident about my dress.
I really like what I've done.
Where's my model? I need her help.
morning, designers. - Good morning, Tim.
how is everybody?
dandelions. good. - Good.
looking around this room, there is a ton of work to be done.
you were supposed to have finished last night.
that clearly hasn't happened.
I have confidence that you'll pull this off, but you're turning me into a wreck.
so make it work. You can do it.
I know you can do it.
Si, se puede.
all right, I'm sending in your models.
Thanks, Tim. - Thank you.
Hi, liciousness. How you doing?
this is gonna look gorgeous.
Oh, it looks great with this, though. - Thanks.
it's okay. The collar's gonna be there.
okay, no problem.
at first I was having second thoughts about my outfit, but I love it, so I'm feeling great.
I really like it. - Me too.
it's cute.
regardless of me just wanting to do what I wanna do, when kendall saw the dress, her whole face lit up, and she gave her beautiful smile.
I like that it's not 100% skintight, because that would've ruined it.
Yeah.
I think it was a good decision that she went with what she wanted to, because it turned out a lot nicer, and I was really proud of her.
you gotta go, girl, go. Get your hair and makeup done.
the look I'm going for today is very ethnic, african.
definitely the hostess with the mostess.
Daniel. - Yes.
you have five minutes. - Okay.
are you gonna be all right?
how you doing, Wesley? You got that panicked look on your face.
can you spin for me?
I kinda noticed that Wesley's model
coulda fit a little bit better into her dress.
time is not on my side for this challenge.
I'm a little worried about the fit just because the fabric's gonna show all the mistakes.
the look on some of the designers' faces, especially team ugly brown fabric, was kind of a look of concern, and I think justly so.
don't do that.
there's a chance I could go home, bcause you just never know.
I'll just be happy being safe today.
Oh, yeah, I'm moving off the safety pins.
we'll try that belt, though. I'm not sure.
the dress is done.
I totally am confident that the judges are gonna love this dress, because I have pushed myself.
suede will be rocking it.
I am hustling as fast as I can, and I finished the dress.
and I'm just crossing my fingers That it's gonna work out on the runway.
it looks great.
all right, designers, models, this is it; we're going down to the runway.
slip your hands in the pockets, And arch back.
you look gorgeous, okay?
follow me. Come, come.
all right. Thank you.
coming up on project runway...
I think shiny, tight, and short ?
hello. - Hi. hi.
welcome to the runway.
as you know, in fashion one day you're in, and the next day, you're out.
your challenge was to design a cocktail dress for some glamorous young clients, your models.
we asked you to make it from green fabrics.
and we decided to mix it up this time, and let your models do the shopping for you.
the winning look will be manufactured and sold by bluefly.com.
all right, let's meet the judges.
first we have top american designer Michael Kors.
Hey, guys.
Michael, hi.
next, we have Nina Garcia.
editor at large for Elle magazine.
and you have probably noticed that we have an empty chair over there.
we have a special guest judge for today.
let's bring her out.
Yay!
when I saw it was Natalie Portman, I totally freaked out.
I was so excited.
I just about peed my pants.
I would like to welcome natalie portman, oscar nominated actress and environmental activist who recently launched te casan - her own vegan shoe collection. - Ah!
I'm so happy to be here. It's one of my favorite shows.
thank you! thank you. - I'm like psyched.
she's so adorable, and she's so tiny.
I could carry her around on my hand.
I'm excited that you guys are participating in eco-fashion because that's definitely the challenge for our generation.
Natalie Portman started a green shoe line called te casan using faux leathers and things like that. It's really cool.
we will score your designs as they come down the runway.
one of you will be named the winner, and one of you will be out.
let's start the show.
I think my outfit embraced elegance.
it embraced my point of view.
it looks like she's ready for a great cocktail party.
I'm stoked.
I was really proud with the way my outfit turned out.
she's my Muse. She's beautiful.
and I loved it.
I liked the outfit.
there were just things like the fit that I wish I could have worked out.
but I like using green fabrics.
I think my outfit comes across as sexy, it comes across as young, and it's not made out of that hideous brown fabric.
I think I'm good.
I think the dress looks really floaty and pretty, and that's kind of what I was going for.
so that makes me happy.
I can't believe that I put it together, and everything's finally done.
my model looks beautiful, kind of like Audrey Hepburn.
I'm totally happy with the result.
I think I nailed this one.
I think it's glamorous. I think it's young.
I think it's party.
and it fits her like a glove.
I love this dress.
I took these green fabrics to the next level.
I'm feeling great about using green fabrics.
it looks chic, it looks beautiful.
it's got youth, and I love it.
she looks great. It's just not something I guess I would typically do.
but I'm glad I had the opportunity to do something a little bit out of my realm.
I am just really proud of what I've done.
and using green materials is modern.
so I think my modern design is gonna be the winner.
I feel really positive, really happy
because it's totally me.
and my model really loved the design.
watching my design go down the runway, it looked so good. And then I peek over at the judges, and it seems like they responded well.
so that's a good thing.
I'm still really excited about the garment that I made even though it's a little short.
I'm wishing I had a little more fabric, but I think it's pretty.
I love her dress and I would wear the dress like that.
she looks really chic, and I'm glad I was able to take a green fabric and make it elegant.
I'm actually happy with it.
we've scored your designs.
will the following designers please step forward?
if I have called your name, congratulations.
your scores have qualified you to move on to the next challenge.
you can leave the runway. Thank you.
the six remaining designers Have the highest and the lowest scores.
one of you will be named the winner, and one of you will be out.
let's bring out your models.
Kenley. - Hi. hi.
tell us, what did you do?
this is the fabric my model chose.
it's organic silk.
I wanted to keep it simple and clean to complement her, something a little bit more classic with the length.
do you like it?
I absolutely love it.
I like this dress.
the streamline silhouette, and the tiny detail in the waist and the high collar.
actually, I had to hand sew this in.
so it's a couture cocktail dress.
I think she looks gorgeous.
I think she looks so elegant, and it definitely stood out, too, as something that was like a really adult glamorous dress.
I think the sharpness of the black at the waist Is great.
balances out the color.
it is the most overused word in fashion.
it's chic.
Thanks.
Wesley, tell us a little bit about your design.
I was really limited In the amount of fabric that I had to make what I had initially had in mind which was something more voluminous.
so I made more of a fitted garment.
I like the little bowtie. I think it's really cute.
but I think it doesn't fit exactly.
I have to say, I give you one of my low scores.
it looks completely overworked.
the seam at the bottom Is completely wavy.
for satin to work, it has to kinda look like human hands didn't touch it.
and this looks like 20 sets of human hands touched it.
and I think in this instance, I mean, I love leggy clothes, but it's crazy short.
I think shiny, tight, and short is the quickest way to look cheap.
Stella, tell us about your cocktail dress.
my model came in with this fabric And two other jerseys.
and I decided to work with this fabric.
I just felt that I would do something simple, plain, make it modern with like one sleeve and fun and flirty with the lace-ups on the sides.
I like the lacing detail.
and somehow you got your personal attitude Into the dress, which I think is so important.
would you wear that?
Yeah, I would.
it definitely fits really nicely. It's very flattering.
I'm really not into asymmetrical stuff personally, but it's really nicely done.
it's much improved from last time.
thank you.
fortunately, she did really well at the store.
I really was happy with the fabrics that my model got.
she's shapely, and I wanted a dress that would kind of accentuate those curves.
I think that the line at the top Is really nice and flattering.
but the things on the side almost looks inside out to me.
like it almost looks like the pieces inside your jeans or something.
can I see the...
the bottom is off-balance.
it looks like she has wings.
listen, I love a curvy girl.
but trust me, even curvy girls, they don't want fins off their butt.
well, my model Tia picked me up the same satin that a lot of other people had.
what I did is I cut bias strips, and I created a pattern.
I would wear that. I love it.
I think it's so sweet and fun and young
and really unique and special.
I really, really love it.
thank you. I'd be honored if you wear it.
Oh, thanks. wow, thank you.
I liked it very much. It is creative.
I mean, I know you worked and you thought about it.
I also like the fact that you have the crazy satin that everyone has, but by manipulating it and working it, you turned it into a new fabric.
I think it's also the right dress on her.
Tia, is this the dress that you wanted?
Yes.
do you love it? - Yes.
you would wear it? - Yep.
if I were ten years younger, I would wear it too.
thank you very much.
karalyn purchased the hemp and silk blend fabric for me.
she likes short things, but I still wanted to make her look elegant and sophisticated.
Karalyn, is this the dress that you wanted?
it's definitely not what I pictured.
it looks a little bit like peter pan, like with the hat.
would you turn around? Can we have a look in the back?
petals here, petals there.
asymmetrical, falling off.
it's got a pocket, it's got a piece, it's got a panel.
it's five dresses in one.
it's all over the place.
okay, we've heard what you had to say.
we're gonna have a little chat.
and then I'm gonna call you back.
you can leave the runway. Thank you.
who's gonna win this challenge?
let's start with Stella.
it fit well.
Yeah. - It was made well, and it fit well.
and so much of this was ill-fitting.
also, the dress reflects a little bit of who she is.
no question. - Well, let's be honest.
biker chick chic in a cocktail dress.
it's hard to get that in there, and she did.
what about Suede?
it was the right dress on the right girl.
I so appreciate the work that went into weaving those strips.
it looked effortless. - Didn't look overworked to me.
and the tulle could really look like, you know, ballerina barbie or something.
but he used it just right.
she was the only one that used that fabric correctly.
it can look cheap or it can look elegant, and she went the elegant way.
she has such a great vibe.
it's like some broad out of the 40's Like came up and, you know, which I think is a lot of what being a designer is you have to have a personality and... and be presentable.
okay, let's go to the ones we didn't like. Wesley.
too tight, too short.
he got way overwrought, and he just-- he tortured the fabric.
I didn't like it at all. I mean, there was nothing that I liked about it.
if it didn't have all that jazz going on on the bottom, then the top could have been a very cute, sort of conservative little dress.
his ambition got the better of him, definitely.
big disappointment.
I didn't like it at all.
it looked like it had fins.
and I had higher hopes for her, to be honest with you.
I think there was something interesting about the outside darts.
but it's kind of a pure mistake, when you take fabric and try to make something out of it that you shouldn't make out of it.
Leanne. - I do think she has ideas.
but it was like all over the place, and she didn't have the right balance.
the way she used the fabric, too, those pieces on top, the draping I didn't really love the way it looked.
you can learn the process of how to edit.
you know, judgment is part of the design process.
okay, let's bring out the designers.
the six of you represent the best and the worst.
one of you will be named the winner and one of you will be out.
one of you will be named the winner, and one of you will be out.
you're in.
you can leave the runway.
and now for the winner.
congratulations...
thank you very much.
your dress will be sold on bluefly.com.
you can leave the runway. thank you. - Thank you very much.
Yeah! Suede rocked it!
Natalie Portman loves my dress.
I could not be happier. This is such a high right now.
all I can think about is how happy my mom's gonna be.
love you, mom.
Kenley, very good work.
you're in. you can leave the runway.
thank you.
you're in.
you can leave the runway.
they gave me another chance.
I worked so hard!
one of you will be out.
your design was unflattering and the fit was poor.
you had too many ideas.
we asked for fashion, and we got a school project.
you're in.
you can leave the runway. - Thank you so much.
Wesley, that means you're out.
auf wiedersehen.
thank you. - Thank you.
I'm really proud of myself for even making it onto the show.
so even though I did leave really early, I still leave with my head held high.
I can't imagine you not being here. - It's okay.
well, this was intense.
Wesley, I need to send you upstairs to clean up your space.
I'm not sure what lies ahead for me. But I wanna show at bryant park.
I know I'll make it there one day. I'm still really young.
I'm just gonna work really hard.
coming up on project runway...
tim will be taking you on a little field trip.
I have no idea where we're going, especially dressed like fools.
this is the destination for your next challenge.
what?
he's going nuts. He gets really crazy and nervous.
and I'm like, what the are you doing? - He goes, "I had to cross the street."
he's, like, so competitive. I swear.
kenley is talking .
do I care? no.
Oh, my god, I have to go jump in front of a taxi after I slit my wrists.
Oh...
is anyone listening to me?
it literally looked like toilet paper caught in a windstorm.
I don't know. I don't feel like I'm falling off my chair anytime soon.
it's like a Carmen Miranda moment.
for this challenge, your models will serve as your clients for a cocktail dress.
and there's more.
your models will do the shopping.
don't forget closures!
this I can't use. you didn't get a zipper?
what am I gonna do with peacock feathers and peacock trim?
I'm worried about you, don't force it.
I hope I have enough time before the runway show.
it's gonna be hell tomorrow.
I'm just praying it just all works out.
congratulations, Suede.
thank you.
you are the winner of this challenge.
Yeah! Suede, rocked it!
shiny, tight, and short is the quickest way to look cheap.
Wesley, you're out.
the winner of project runway will receive a 2009 saturn vue hybrid, an opportunity to sell their line on bluefly.com, and $100, 000 to start their own line furnished by tresemme professional hair care.
this is project runway.
I feel really sad that Wesley's gone, and I'm really bummed because I felt that we were connecting well.
Stella.
we have to get up.
I'll get ready in 10 minutes.
I'm really excited going into a new challenge.
I am hoping that it's gonna be something that can show my point of view and that I can really just kind of run with.
after you.
let's do this thing.
for your last challenge, we let you pick your models.
but we're going to mix it up this time.
let's bring out the winning and losing designers' models.
suede, you were the winner of the last challenge.
your model was Tia.
if you decide to stay with her, Alyssa will be out.
if you decide to swap with another designer, I will bring out all the models for you to choose from.
what do you want to do?
suede loves Tia. He could never change.
so Suede's gonna keep Tia.
that means, Alyssa, you're out.
auf wiedersehen.
thank you. thank you.
Bye. bye.
okay, are you ready for your next challenge?
Yeah.
you know what?
I think you guys have worked pretty hard so far.
so go back to Atlas.
tim is gonna meet you there, and he will take you out for a night on the town.
have fun, and I'll see you on the runway.
Bye. bye.
where do you think we're going?
Disneyland. No, I don't know.
I did allow my mind to wander and think, maybe a nice dinner, maybe going out.
we all know Tim ain't taking a bunch of us to his house, But I had a feeling that we might go to some bar or restaurant one of his favorite places.
do you have an appointment?
Hello, Blayne.
Hi, Tim.
are you ready for your night out on the town?
Yeah. So ready.
are we going to the clubs?
we're going out in the rain, which is why I'm dressed like this.
all right, cool.
Hi, Terri. Hi.
how are you?
I just have to tell you, it's raining.
so it's gonna be an interesting night.
ready for the rain, boys?
I'm hoping that we're going somewhere at least fun, but rain boots and ponchos?
okay, here we go.
that scares me.
designers, this is the destination of your challenge.
Yeah! come on!
a double-decker bus.
what?
being on a tour bus, raining, in horrible clothes, is not my idea of fun.
I want to get all dolled up and go out dancing.
all right, designers.
your next challenge is to design a look of your choice for a night out on the town inspired by new york at night.
so we're going to take a little bus tour.
it's cold, it's wet.
I don't know what to think.
I'm really just thinking about my hair.
this bus is going to make four stops.
with each stop, one group of you will get off we have cameras for you to record your sources of inspiration.
you'll have an hour to take photographs, and then you'll make your way back to the Atlas apartments.
let's go for a ride!
this is fun! it's like a ride!
it's a party bus!
Oh, look at that pretty building with the lights.
that's incredible! oh, it changes color!
I'm from new york, and I have never been on one of these buses, and I always thought they were cheesy, but this is amazing.
you see everything.
I'm like, wow. All right.
it's a great view from up here.
Oh, I love it.
okay, this is the first stop for Suede, Daniel, lLanne, and Jennifer.
have fun!
new York is super inspirational.
you can walk out on the street and you can see anything.
I've lived here for about 15 years, and I love it.
Stella, Kenley, Blayne, Keith, this is your stop. Have fun.
I'm getting off at times square.
and it's so stimulating already.
like, there's all the lights and all the people.
this is so you, Blayne.
it's kind of sensory overload.
is there any tanning salons down here?
korto, Kelli, Joe, this is your destination.
have fun. Thanks.
well, we're really in a great spot, bcause we've got grand central here.
we've got the Chrysler building.
so Terri, Emily, Jerell, this is your stop.
see you later.
thank you.
I was inspired by money.
one of the first things, I took a picture of was a huge clock.
it kind of, you know, made me think about the old saying, you know, the city that never sleeps.
I'm completely in my zone and I'm taking pictures of a woman walking.
the light behind her reflects her shadow on the ground, so it almost looks like the shadow has a halo.
um, who knows how to work this camera?
Hey, Blayne. What?
how do you use this camera?
you gotta open up the thing, baby.
how do you zoom?
Oh, it's dark.
cross, cross, cross, cross.
a fire hydrant catches my eye that's black and silver, and it kind of represented that end-of-the-world mad max type of look.
I'm gonna go with that one.
that's killer.
the picture I take captures movement and energy and people of new york at night.
you finding some cool stuff?
Yeah. I really kind of have an idea of what i want, though.
I turned down this one street and there I see the graffiti with all of the stickers all over it.
and I was like, okay, I like it.
and the way I shot it, it was more-- so it was more abstract.
you guys mind if we cross the street to the sex shop?
Oh, my god.
Oh, I like the colors on that building.
I was born and raised in Salt Lake city, Utah.
all sides of my family are practicing mormons.
being gay in salt lake city is really difficult.
Oh, hold on. I think this might be it.
I've thought about moving to New York.
I want to be known by the world or not, time to get this party started.
last night, Tim tells us our challenge is to go out in New York city.
at night to create a garment for a night out on the town.
good morning, designers.
Oh, hey, how's it going? -How are you?
good. You dried off?
I'm still a little wet.
I see that some of you are already pulling up your photos and examining them.
you have half an hour to choose one photo to serve as the inspiration for your look for a night out on the town.
then we're going to go shopping.
you'll have a budget of $100.
I will be back in 30 minutes.
okay. All right.
choose away.
this is so pretty. It's like an elegant tiled wall.
there's a lot of pressure because this is our first chance to really show who you are as a designer.
so I picked this picture of this map
and it sort of looked like a painted print.
that's the picture, trust me.
it was almost like, like, it was so perfect.
I get this amazing shot of five neon colors, and it's everything that I ever wanted.
and I can't wait to just start my garment.
Oh, that's gorgeous.
it doesn't even look like it's a picture.
I love this one, bcause not until you get close do you really see what's in there, you know?
Yeah.
kind of rough edges.
fortunately, I was able to find this water-covered, ruined magazine on the ground that had been stepped on, and I kind of want to go with something that is sexy but at the same time has some volume to it, bcause I like volume.
I want to be in the top three.
I want to be the winner.
designers, we're going on our very first trip to Mood.
finally you can choose your own fabrics.
okay? -Yes.
go, go, go.
who's helping me here?
it was a maze for me.
someone needs to help me.
I always like to incorporate the 40's and 50's aesthetic to my look.
my style is a modern-day calendar girl.
$18 a yard? -Hmm.
holy moly.
I immediately head to the silk chiffon department and start pulling some bright, poppy colors because I gotta get that dress moving.
who's helping me?
how much do you think is on there?
I started to pull out some charmeuses in midnight blue, and I chose white charmeuse as the clock face, because I wanted it to be very literal.
I don't know if it was a miracle, but my hand grabs a hold to this fabric.
I pull it out, and it had every color that I needed in the photo.
there it was.
I was like, "give me three yards."
let's bounce.
time's up, okay?
the pressure.
thank you, Mood.
thank you, Mood.
home sweet home.
designers.
Hey, Tim. Hi, Tim.
I have good news.
you have until 1: 00 tonight.
okay?
and the winner of this challenge will have immunity for the next challenge.
and cannot be eliminated.
so push, push, push, push.
Thanks, Tim.
thank you.
after winning my first challenge, I definitely cannot rest.
suede is here to rock it.
Suede's decided on working with a shirtdress silhouette.
Suede's giving little flecks of color which goes back to my inspirational photo.
it's not a lot of it, but it's small touches that are gonna really drive that business.
is anyone done who can help me?
did you find a good print? - I did.
don't you think it looks like it?-Hmm.
my garment's gonna show the judges who I am as a designer.
it's colorful, it's chic, it's new, it's fresh.
when I look at Kenley's dress, the print, I think, is really not quite getting it.
it's a little bit Fort Lauderdale lawn-cushiony kind of thing.
you are a great designer and you know that.
just because I didn't like what you did before, it's not you, right? - I know.
I'm just afraid I'm gonna, like, be too creative again.
I decided to focus on a picture of a tree planter.
it's architectural and it's organic, and that's really what I'm about as a designer.
Oh, I love it.
after having been in the bottom two from the previous challenge, I really want to show the judges that I'm just an amazing designer.
Yeah, at this point, she's gonna go topless.
just make her a bra.
pasties.
Yeah. There you go, pasties.
and just put straps on them.
I'm gonna eat you.
that was freaky.
I look over and you're like...
eat you.
I think that Blayne is a total weirdo.
Kenley, I'm about to throw this orange slice at you.
if I don't find shoes, I'm gonna be pissed.
I just have this outfit with so much color, it's like, you know?
I'm creating my own progressive idea on a fringe dress.
it has hundreds of these small pieces of fabric that have been sewn to it.
I come from an abstract artist background, and I feel like that's what I represent, who I am, and my designs are the best.
I think Keith's dress is a lot of work.
I mean, I'm talking about little pieces of fabric floating on, like, a sheath. But who wears that?
good.
this is gonna be on the sleeve.
just pleats and colors and drapey, drapey, drapey.
pretty.
I knew immediately I wanted some kind of graffiti or some kind of sense of images of New York.
I wanted to do an open-back dress with flare-length pants, and I was like, this is gonna work.
tough and dirty.
I think it's gonna stop here, and then there's gonna be a big black band.
I'm going back and forth between keeping it as a simple silhouette and covering everything in ruffles or adding more, adding less, trying to figure out the flow.
I'm looking around the room and I notice that Emily's dress was just not well made at all.
it's been done. It's old.
it's cliche.
and I immediately think that she's in trouble.
eh, what a gay little grommet.
I chose the blinder that's on the horse, and the reason why I chose that is because I'm into leather.
I did want to make leather pants and a leather vest.
this entire outfit is absolutely my aesthetic.
I am rock and roll, and I'm gonna die being rock and roll.
Stella's hammering, it pisses me off.
if you don't like it, get the outta here.
shut up.
coming up on project runway...
Keith, your model had to drop out of the competition.
designers, hi.
I'm here to check in on you, all right?
Jennifer. - Hi, tim.
how are you?
okay.
so talk to me about this skirt.
I would not finish it like this.
good, because this is not going to work.
I'm just worried about time for you. - Yeah.
with these three hemlines.
and all these little-- and the sleeves.
Yeah, me too, but-- you just have a lot of work to do.
I know.
all right, you know what you're doing.
do it. Thank you.
Jennifer's garment looks very matronly, like an old vintage garment that no one would touch.
it just doesn't really look chic at all.
Keith. - Hey, buddy.
how are you doing? - I'm good. Talk to me.
what is this?
let me show you my picture. - What is it?
it was a magazine that was on the ground, had been stepped on, had been rained on.
and so that's what I'm trying to do here is take these different fabrics and kind of put them together in lots of layers.
this dress will have a shape? - Yeah.
it'll be fitted?
Yeah. - Good. Just keep going.
okay. Much appreciated, Tim.
Hi, Tim. How are you?
fine.This is my picture.
which is beautiful. I love this.
Yeah. I found this ombred - Oh, wow.
Yeah, that looks really good with the print.
so it's exposed? - Yes.
completely exposed.
I mean, I love the silhouette.
the use of half this, half this.
to me, looks a little costumey.
what? it does?
but that doesn't mean it can't be fantastic.
I'm pretty confident. I love this.
all right, do it.
I will.
Terri, talk to me.
I'm the kind of girl that's, like, very much into street culture, break-dancing, hip-hop, and kind of the underground scene.
so I really felt like that was a major part of New York city.
this is this.
Yes, that's what I feel.
I believe I'm gonna win this competition based on my diversity of creativity.
I mixed street with high fashion.
it's chic, it's funk, it's hip-hop, it's all into one.
so what are you doing with it?
I'm gonna create an open-back dress, so the entire back is open.
so the pant comes up here. - Yes.
people will think it's a whole dress, and then you turn around and it's like, oh, my gosh, it's-- is it like, "oh, my gosh," or is it like, "oh, my god"?
no, no, it's, "oh, my god."
it's a good moment.
I'll make you happy. - Okay.
Leanne. - Hi, Tim.
how are you?
I've got a bit of work to do.
this is gorgeous.
thank you. I'm really, really happy with the skirt.
you should be.
and I'm in the process of working on the top, which is gonna be kind of just a sleeveless blouse.
okay, something basic, simple.
Yeah, I definitely don't want to take away from the skirt.
no, you don't, because the skirt is the statement.
so just don't overwork it.
I won't, for sure. - All right.
Emily. - Hi, Tim.
how are you? - I'm well.
good. So talk to me.
um, this is the photograph that I took, which is a long exposure of the movement and the energy of new york.
but this is a black dress with a great big oversized corsage.
and the judges' expectations are extraordinarily high.
so this is disappointing?
well, yeah.
at this point, it is.
so take this further.
I want more.
all right? - Okay.
Thanks, Emily. - Thanks.
tim gave me kind of a mixed review, but I have my own sense of style, direction, and I'm happy with my dress.
all right, designers, you have until 1: 00 a. m. to finish.
okay?
all right, Tim, holla at your boy.
holla at your boy?
is that the phrase? Holla at your boy.
holla at your boy? What does it mean?
it means, holla at your dog, shadow.
holla at your boy?
Yeah. I'll get it.
holla at your boy!
just say "holla."
Holla. - Holla.
Holla. Holla or hello?
holla! yeah.
I'll see you in the morning.
thank you.
good night. Make it work.
carry on. Holla at your boy.
the 75 things I already have cut out isn't enough.
Oh, man, I hope they give us more time than they usually do tomorrow.
it is our first challenge that we have a lot of freedom when it comes to what we get to present to the judges.
I feel like it's my duty to create an ambitious design that shows them I have a point of view.
move quickly and with purpose.
I think a lot of people are pressed for time.
I know I am.
like, I think I started freaking out just a little bit.
Oh, I hate my life.
I'm done looking at my garment for the night.
I'm a little bit nervous bcause I have some work to do.
I'm freaking out.
what about you, Keith? Are you done?
I'm not even close to being done.
are you guys ready to win this? - Yeah.
Parsons, here we come.
how are you doing, Sueder?
Suede's okay. How about you?
I'm a little stressed.
welcome to elimination day, right?
it's gonna be interesting to see how many pincushions end up going down that runway today.
good morning, designers.
how is everybody?
good. Good. Good.
all right, you have an hour to send your models to the tresemme hair salon and the l'oreal paris makeup room.
please borrow generously from the bluefly.com accessory wall.
Where's Keith?
Keith. Yes, sir.
your model Runa had to drop out of the competition, so we're bringing back Alyssa.
she will be your model.
so this is a "make it work" moment for you.
Oh, I guess, huh?
to have to switch models when you're already behind on your dress just adds another level of stress.
but you have to make it work.
you have to create killer fashion.
all right, everybody.
I'm sending in your models.
ladies.
Hey, Alyssa, I'm Keith. - Hi.
how are you doing? - I'm good. How are you?
I was not prepared to have to refit the whole thing.
I'm gonna go ahead and try to bust this shite out.
how's it going
Oh, I'm trying to get these petally things on, like, in a frenzy.
it's so pretty on you.
this is--Oh, we got this. Oh, we got this.
I want to win.
either want to win or be in the top three.
we want a center part because this is asymmetrical.
definitely tall and, like, straight up.
all right, let's go. Thank you.
the seams are really cool.
Thanks.
I just wish I could have had time to do them a little bit nicer, you know?
I'm totally racing the clock, ironically.
and I'm shaking in my boots about what the judges are gonna say about my garment.
but I felt maybe I could kind of squeeze my way on to the next round.
Oh, my god, the front hem, I feel like I'm doing this so ghetto.
it's all you have time for.
designers, you have ten minutes remaining before we walk down to the runway, and I'm serious about the ten minutes, all right?
is anyone listening to me?
all right?
okay, you're good, baby.
my baby hot.
could you lift the boob up a little?
where is the scissors? Where are the scissors?
where the hell is my going here?
Oh, my god, my scissors!
okay, let your arms down.
how's the top fitting? the hair is working.
all right, designers, models, we're going down to the runway.
follow me, please.
when I see my garment on my model, I'm actually very happy with it.
I think it's beautiful.
I feel pretty confident.
Stella.
Yeah, babe, I'm coming.
Joe.
let's get ready to runway.
okay.
coming up on project runway...
I don't feel like I'm so wowed by the dress.
it literally looked like toilet paper caught in a windstorm.
hello.
welcome to the runway.
as you know, in fashion one day you're in, and the next day, you're out.
your challenge was to create a look for a night out on the town, using new york city at night as your inspiration.
okay, let's meet the judges.
first we have top american designer Michael Kors.
Hey, guys.
Hi, Michael. - Hi.
next, we have Nina Garcia, editor at large for Elle magazine.
Hi, everyone.
and New York night life aficionado, comedienne and actress, Sandra Bernhard.
she will be touring the nation with her one woman show, Without You I'm Nothing, in september.
we will score your designs as they come down the runway.
one of you will be named the winner, and one of you will be out.
let's start the show.
my outfit had texture.
it had movement, just like the city.
I think it was a beautiful piece of killer fashion.
I think she looks radiant.
super flirty, like, the colors pop amazingly.
as I see my garment come down the runway, I feel really confident about it.
I think it conveyed exactly what I wanted.
I think that the dress clearly represents the inspiration of the photograph.
but I don't know if the dress is a clear enough representation of myself as a designer.
my final design is so me.
I certainly edited, so I think the judges are going to appreciate that.
it's very easy to see the inspiration in my design.
it's just not as fun and young as I would like it to be.
I'm getting really nervous.
I think that I really captured the image in the gown.
I'm really hoping that the judges see my dress as being exactly what the challenge asked for.
Germaine completely embodied everything I had hoped she would, and I'm completely 100% happy with the final look.
the dress looks incredible.
I really do feel that it reflects my point of view.
I was so happy.
I thoughtmy dress looked new and fresh and I love the tulle.
I wouldn't have done anything differently.
I love the way my garment looks, although I am so worried that they're gonna say, "this is way too abstract."
what were you thinking?
how do I know this is New York?
this could be anything.
my outfit looked bright and pretty and hard and rocking.
as I see my jumpsuit come down the runway, it looks hot, and I'm happy.
I'm really feeling good.
my garment had attitude. I mean, it's beautiful.
but I was still nervous because I'm taking a risk with a backless dress.
we've scored your designs.
will the following designers please step forward?
Keith.
Kenley.
Emily.
Terri.
Jennifer.
Leanne.
if I have not called your name, congratulations.
your scores have qualified you to move on to the next challenge.
you can leave the runway.
the six remaining designers have the highest and the lowest scores.
one of you will be named the winner and one of you will be out.
let's bring out your models.
Kenley, tell us about your dress.
my picture was really beautiful tiled wall.
and when I saw it, I immediately thought of a print that looked painted.
I just wanted her to be very artistic and comfortable with wearing this.
I think you have to be that tall and that thin to wear that dress.
it could hide, though.
if you have one big thigh, and one thin thigh.
or some kind of a goiter or a large growth.
it's funny.
I mean, it's very 80's Joan Collins kind of power bitch dress.
but I think that a girl who was not around in the 80's would really appreciate this dress.
I agree with Michael.
it is a little lacroix, ungaro but updated.
I love the play on volume.
I think it's adorable.
thank you so much.
Keith.
I actually found a magazine on the ground that had been kicked around.
it was the idea that you could kind of uphold the beauty that's kind of hidden within the city.
I think the biggest problem with the dress is all that white fabric in there.
when she walked by, I mean, it literally looked like toilet paper caught in a windstorm.
the shape is missing for me a little bit.
like, this is just a lot of pieces sewed on, and I can't see a beautiful body anymore.
I just think it doesn't look polished.
and maybe it has to do with the hem where you left everything uneven.
that was my point of view.
but all in all, the effect is very sloppy when it should be more together.
Terri.
when I got my location, I was like, I need to see, like, some graffiti and the post no bills with all the stickers and stuff everywhere, 'cause I live for that.
my girl, she's, like, very confident.
everyone knows her.
they want her to be at the party.
she is going to places.
I wrote, "fierce, sexy, and in control."
Oh, thank you.
and I said, here's a woman who's walking down a dark street and if somebody is on her tail, she'll turn around and say, "i have a knife, and I will cut you up."
I love the whole attitude behind it.
thank you.
I gave it a good score because I think it's cool.
also because you think outside the box.
you're like, this is my style.
I love the look.
I think that she's got the right hair, the right attitude,
and she's a girl you want to know.
thank you. thank you.
Emily.
Yes.
what inspired you?
we were in washington square park, and I put the camera on a long exposure and it made this amazing kind of streak of light.
and I thought that really captured the essence of New York.
and I think that my dress reflects that.
I would have been more interested had it been something flatter as a part of the actual dress.
right.
to me, this is more cha-cha and over the top.
it's like a Carmen Miranda moment.
I think the ruffles take over your dress.
you've got this very sharp little dress underneath.
you know, it's well-tailored.
but I think this explosion of ruffle is not placed fabulously.
look where they're hitting her.
it's just distracting for, you know, for the eye and for the wearer.
when in doubt, keep it simple.
Leanne.
since everything was wet, I was noticing all of these ordinary things that you walk by dozens of times a day.
so my inspiration came from the planter grate around a tree.
it was very architectural in shape, yet it was still very organic.
that's a skirt and a top?
skirt, yeah, and a blouse.
that's cool.
and it looks like a dress, which is really nice too.
it's very pretty.
thank you.
well, I love the idea that it's separates.
let's be honest.
I mean, people don't wear dresses every day of their lives.
I think that it's impeccable.
I would wear that in a heartbeat.
it just came right out of the store.
it doesn't look like you just whipped that up in a day.
thank you.
Jennifer, tell us about your dress.
I got off at Columbus Circle and so I saw these clocks.
and my fashion, usually I like to put in a touch of surrealism, so I usually describe my look as Holly Golightly goes to a salvador dali exhibit.
I don't get a sense of the surprise that surrealism brings to the fashion picture in this dress, and I think that the sewing at the hem is certainly not helping.
I don't think this is intentional.
I wrote down "matronly" immediately.
I don't feel like I'm falling off my chair anytime soon because I'm so wowed by the dress.
I think it's okay.
I would venture to say it's on the boring side.
okay, we've heard what you had to say.
we're gonna have a little chat, and then we'll call you back.
you can leave the runway. Thank you.
so who did we like in this challenge?
I personally adored Terri Stevens, bcause I just loved her whole vibe.
her girl had a real attitude.
I loved the idea of the pants with the dress.
she turned the corner, and you were like, "who is she? I want to know her."
Kenley.
I thought that the dress had real energy.
she surprised me because it didn't look like what she's done before.
she had a lot of elements in that dress.
however, they all came about perfectly.
Leanne.
it's very wearable, and at the same time, it looks very modern.
last week, she was almost gone.
Oh. And why was that?
because she was someone that over-designed.
you would never know, looking at that.
she really learned quickly how to edit, and at the time, she still held on to her own thing.
now let's move on to the ones that we didn't like so much.
for example, Emily.
Oh, Emily.
the biggest problem really, to me, was the placement of the ruffles was so insane.
you know, cutting across her chest here.
it was just unattractive.
I have no comment.
that's terrible.
Oh, my god!
the worst review is no review.
Keith.
I didn't like that.
I thought she just--really, it looked like just toilet paper.
well, you know, also, if he was drawing from a newspaper or a magazine, I would have thought he would have gone with grays and blacks.
the white was too, like, predominant.
not good.
and Jennifer.
you know, she says that, you know, her thing is surrealism.
but she's kind of drawn back here and sends out something that looks very watered down.
see, Jennifer, for me, is a case where I'm not really that interested to see more, to be honest.
to me, that was just really boring.
there was nothing about that dress that I found interesting.
and it just wasn't nicely, you know, executed.
so have we made our decision?
okay, let's bring them back out.
the six of you represent the best and the worst.
one of you will be named the winner and one of you will be out.
one of you will be named the winner, and one of you will be out.
Terri.
you're in.
you can leave the runway.
and now for the winner.
congratulations...
Kenley.
thank you so much.
you are the winner of this challenge, and you will also have immunity for the next challenge.
cool. You cannot be eliminated.
you can leave the runway.
thank you. Thanks.
I'm so excited because I know now that the judges get me.
relish it.
I'm so happy.
I haven't won anything major in my life, so it was huge for me.
Leanne, good work.
you're also in.
you can leave the runway.
thank you.
Keith, you're in.
you can leave the runway.
Emily, Jennifer, one of you will be out.
Emily, your look was distracting and a cliche, and your voice as a designer didn't come through.
Jennifer, you say that you're a surrealist, but the dress that you showed us was boring and matronly.
Jennifer...
you're in.
you can leave the runway.
that means, Emily, you're out.
auf wiedersehen.
hell no, this was not the losing dress for the challenge.
that dress was beautiful. It was finished.
it showed personality.
this was just a drop in my overflowing bucket of experiences, and I'm really glad that I met all of you.
I hate to say this but I have to send you upstairs to clean up your space, Emily.
okay?
we're gonna miss you.
I'm feeling disappointed that I'm leaving this early in the competition, but I've got a beautiful collection to put out, so I'm gonna take this experience and run with it.
coming up on project runway...
designers, you ready for your field trip?
Yeah! Yes!
Oh, my god, this place is ginormous.
it's not very glamorous, is it?
this has nothing to do with what I'm really used to.
that was mine.
Keith has taken my fabric.
I was like, oh, no, you didn't.
are we getting a little sgt. pepper today?
I don't even know what that is.
Oh, god.
you rethreaded my machine. is he serious?
there's too much drama 'cause there's too many queens around.
I don't see this having any relevance with the challenge.
she's from the republic of cocktail land?
I mean, it's out there.
visit bravotv.com to learn more about the fashions you've seen on today's show.
that's, like, two years old.
I got scared.
you were supposed to Bebilly Ocean.
why would Michael Jackson sign with Roland Orzabal?
why would Billy Oceansing with Roland Orzabal?
cause he's awesome.
now we gotta addthe moonwalk into shout and hope the judges don't slam us for it.
I don't know how to moonwalk.
you better learn quick.
Shawn spencer and Mr. Burton Guster.
let's give 'em a nice round of applause.
she'll be... Comin' around the mountain when she comes she'll be comin' around the mountain when she comes she'll be comin' around the mountain she'll be comin' around the mountain she'll be comin' around the mountain when she comes...
ave Maria ...
you're stiff. Inarticulate. Slightly jaundiced.
asymmetrical. You smell.
the one on the right-- there's somethingin your teeth.
all in all, I'd say there's absolutely nothing worth while about either one of you.
but we haven't even sang yet.
apples and oranges.
anybody else?
I like 'em.
well, of course you liked them. You've been a sleep for the last 45 minutes.
Zapato? - Well, I-- good. Moving on.
coming up after the break- - you see what I mean?
you shooshing me for reality TV?
Dude--zip!
I'm lester beaconand this is American duos.
rule number one, Shawn-- no talking during duos.
Oh, for the love of Lori Loughlin.
please use the pause button just once.
why did we get tivo if we never fast-forward and I can't stop for commentary?
whoa, no calls either.
Gus, don't be a rabid porcupine.
this is just another knock off of the other knock off of the original knock off of that other show.
and welcome back to American duos.
first of all, Shawn, look at the guy on the right.
Zapato? He's not black.
he's Latino. That's different.
the contestants in this one are duos, which makes it way more compelling.
they have to mesh;become one soul.
like V'ger and Stephen Collinsin star Trek I.
and they're shooting in Santa Barbara this year, which more than compensates.
don't you dare answer that.
dude, it's Jules.
she could be bleeding and in a ditch.
she's not bleeding. - She could be in a ditch.
she's not in a ditch. - She could be lonely and in the shower.
she has a shower phone? - I certainly hope so.
dude, it's a win-win... except for the ditch one.
Hello?
Nothing...at all.
we'll be right there.
that's it. I'm canceling the tivo.
no more frame-by-frame. No more ghost cat.
I recorded that by accident.
then why didn't you erase it for three months?
fine, but I'm putting up the official Burton Gusterspoiler alert.
until I get backand watch the recording, nobody utters a wordabout American duos.
that's going to be difficult.
Why?
Oh, wow! That's Nigel, St. Nigel.
I don't remember the person to whom you are referring.
but she was hideous.
this is them?
Yes, this is Shawn Spencerand Burton Guster-- our resident psychic team.
the answer is no.
Mr. St. Nigel, this is exactlywhat you asked for.
hear them out.
there's no reason.
Hear...them...out.
Nigel needs protection.
do you realize you're in a police station?
I don't trust the police.
they're useless. No offense.
Oh, none taken.
Mr. St. Nigel has beenthe victim of a series of attempts and threats on his life by a crazed stalker.
he believes that even the police could somehow bein on the conspiracy even though we've assured him that
I can speak for myself. And stop slouching.
every time I bring in some sort of professional protection my attacker gets closer.
my car has been tampered with.
my trailer has been broken into.
accidents follow me everywhere.
what I need is someone who can anticipate my attacker's next move.
someone who can move about undetected.
you're talking about a psychic.
someone who can see danger before it occurs.
someone who can say, "Nigel, duck!
before the bulletexits the chamber.
spare me the theatrics.
can you do it or not?
look, we are asking you to go undercover.
no one outside of this office will know that you're on the job.
what about detective Lassiter?
absolutely not.
his hair looks like it's been poured out of a cake mold.
Nigel, get ready to feel safe.
Jules, I need complete access to the theater.
green rooms, air shafts, spokesmodels...
whoa, whoa, slow down. We need to think this through.
come up with a plan. You'll need to blend.
obviously the local policealready know you so a false identity
I already have a plan. - You have a plan?
what is it?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you wanted us to be stealth.
bring on the next contestants.
presenting Shawn Spence Starr and Gus tt Showbizz.
good luck, guys.
so, what do you two hope to get out of the competition?
just hope to be here long enough to do something awesome.
well, you know, round one is the most...
why don't you justgo ahead? - Warm up.
I keep tonight I keep tonight ...
you're warm. You're red hot.
talking away I don't know wha- what to say
I'll say it anyway slowly learn that life is okay wrong verse.
I'll be coming for your love okay take on me take on me take on me take on me I'll be gone in a dream...
Really?
Well...that was, um... something.
Mm-hmm. Something awesome.
honestly, guys.
bad news.
I mean, this is gonna hurt-- although I do love your style because you both chose to wear purple.
but I think we need to be forth-- forth-- forth--forth right in saying that
that we cannot even begin to understand how brilliant that was.
what are you--are you crazy?
it was real. It was rough.
Post-post-postmodern, yet challenging.
Sandpaper-esque.
they weren't even singingthe same verse. I'm voting no.
I'm voting yes. - Well, it's up to Zapato.
he votes yes. - he hasn't even spoken.
he doesn't need to. - Zapato?
votes yes. - Come on!
jam a cork in it, Lester. We're moving on.
Nigel, we all saw what happened with the Indian kid on that other show and...
next! - look out!
Ahem...sweet!
see you guys in round two.
Lester, this is ludicrous!
I almost died...again!
Oh, it was an accident! Any fool could see that.
we've had too many costly delays already.
you're paranoid, Nigel!
that thing could've almost landed on any one of us.
but it didn't, Lester.
it landed on me!
you daft punk!
have you guys gone completely insane?
no. - What was that?
us advancing to the next round.
you got half the words wrong!
Jules, those a-ha guysare Norwegian.
they didn't even know what they were singing.
what are you planning on singing for round two?
Yankee rose, David Lee Roth.
what? Too obvious?
No--Gus can sing the guitar part.
guys, if you're gonna ayin this competition, you're gonna need to step it up--way up.
now, I have to go. I can't be seen talking to you.
and not just because you're undercover.
well, nigel's essentially a monster.
he's an equal-opportunitybastard.
the list of suspects can be narrowed down to everybody.
even I kind of want to kill him.
so where does that leave us?
well, there have beenat least nine incidents that can be counted as attempts on his life--in nine different cities.
we have to assume it's someonewho's here every week.
great. No, not great.
that only narrows it downto crew, security, and fans.
most of which are pretty die-hard.
we're gonna have to talk to everybody, which is gonna be difficult, because I think I'm developing a polyp.
I'm Shawn Spence Starr.
this is my partner, Gus tt Showbizz.
the extra tis for extra talent.
we just advanced to the second round.
Congratulations! Bevin.
Bevin Rennie Llywellen. I'm next, I think.
I think you got us beat with that name already.
Where's your partner?
I got rid of him.
I sing both parts.
the show's called American duos.
it's my hook.
everyone needs a thing, right?
I learned that last year.
good luck, dudes.
he did it. - Him?
you talk to one dude and you're done?
his nameis Bevin Rennie Llywellen.
we made it!
Hey, you fellow winners!
chance cade. This here's my brother rance.
we just made it to the next round too.
Rance...nice.
Nigel just called us a curious cocktail of inbreeding and type 2 diabetes.
but then he passed us throughanyway.
that's hitting below the belt.
Yeah, well... Australian people are mean.
Hey! Let's go.
I was wrong;they did it. - Shawn.
the stalker could've accessed the fallen light from up here.
he sure could've.
you supposed to beup here?
define "supposed to be."
how do you expect me to carry you two howler monkeys through tomorrow?
well, I might've beena little pitchy.
I had a dairy-heavyjamba juice.
stop the excuses. Step it up!
I cannot carry you through another round.
I think I preferred the stalker.
don't. - Don't what?
Uh...smoke.
those things'll kill you.
well, add them to the list.
stop!
I do not have physical contact with people with arm hair!
that case-- was a gift from Les Mckeown of the bay city rollers.
it's a very expensive bla.
how many do we got, officer?
a lot--you're sure that you wanted everybody who was in the building?
well, that's what I said, isn't it?
everybody inside, everybody outside.
it's attempted murder. I'm not screwing around here.
okay, but- - just stop talking and open the door, please.
really, Mcnab, you might want to openyour ears for once. You could learn...
go get me some coffee.
great.
what are you two doing down at that competition?
we're looking for our big break.
do I get a phone call?
no, I am trying to conduct an investigation. Out!
don't you want to ask usif we did it?
ask him. I plead the fifth.
what's happening, undercover partner?
no public discussion of your undercover business.
we need a choreographer. - You need a choreographer.
you both have many needs, so...
so I'm gettinga very strong vibration that you can dance.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
well, I did goto cheerleader camp.
for two weeks. I got kicked out.
kicked out? - Yeah, it's a long story.
suffice to say I don't like liars who steal nail polishand then pass out when you slap 'ema little bit on the back of the head.
Jules, listen--I can feel in my heart that you can get into the groove.
now, we need to step it up, literally.
and we need to stomp the yard...figuratively.
we've advanced to round two.
this is an elite class of performer.
Shawn, 97 teams have advanced to round two.
we're out of time. You're all we've got.
everything's riding on this! Step up to the plate!
guys.
sit. Okay, look-- the only time I have ever danced publicly was in a high school performance of everybody hip-hop!
which closed after two performances.
Jules, all we do is argue.
Gus is very stubborn. We need a guiding force.
a svengali, if you will.
Shawn, I'm a detective, not a svengali.
Jules- - shawn, I think I would know if I were a svengali.
fine.
whatever. I guess my heart vibesare jammed.
never mind.
wait.
so what exactly do you do on the show, zappito? - Zapato.
it's immaterial.
I'm a judge.
what kind of judge?
a talent judge...on camera.
sit on the far left.
Really?
have you seen the show?
Yeah, a hundred times. I'm sure I would've remembered you.
I can't believe this.
I was the first person hired for the show.
my first record went gold.
well, you are spinning yourself into circles, whoever you are.
maybe you should go outsideand rethink your story.
what story? - Exactly.
get him out of here.
keep an eye on that one.
who's next?
Yeah, great, the bride of Frankenstein. Have a seat.
what am I doing here?
well, let's see.
your trailer's right next to nigel's.
you hate him.
and you can't seem to account for your where abouts for most of the last 60 days.
everybody hates Nigel.
and everybody loves Raymond.
but everybody doesn't have a vacant sense of morality and an assault with a deadlyweapon charge on their record.
that was a publicity stunt.
the "weapon" was a fork lift and I was drunk on a spray bottle of charlie.
well, I'm gonna needsome answers, and fast.
otherwise you and I are gonna turn on the hot lights, do the "lindsay hop"and see who cracks first.
now you're trying to seduce me.
I never thought I would make this sound in my lifetime, but...ew.
you left me alonehalf the day.
you were at a police station.
you'll never make itas bodyguards.
we're not bodyguards.
you'll never make itas anything.
Oh, thank god!
I'm starving.
hmm. What do you got there?
my standing order.
wait! - Give it back!
no. - Give it back!
no.
what is it with you and throwing things?
don't eat that! - Why the devil not?
cause I'm getting a very strong feeling about this sandwich.
it's- - delicious?
no. Herb-crusted? No!
it's not from the hotel kitchen.
And?
and...it's poisoned.
well, it stings, but it looks like Spencer was right.
according to the toxicology reports, there's enough drugsto kill a clydesdale in that tuna nicoise saladsandwich.
you see, your hotel detail couldn't even manage one room.
well, pardon me, but I'm not the one out ordering room service with a big target painted on my back.
it was a standing order!
we're almost through with the screen of your room, Mr. St. Nigel.
you can return when we clear it.
fantastic, because to be honest, gus and I have slightly more pressing issues at the moment.
we need to rehearse.
how did you knowthat sandwich didn't come from the kitchen?
easy, there were only 83 sesame seeds on his bun.
all the other onesfrom the hotel have 87.
are you serious? - No.
the other ones have swords.
Nigel's had a toothpick. I'm not rain man, Gus.
you sing like rain man. - Spencer!
you missed something--we found prints.
was he ina little red corvette?
under the cherry moon?
finger prints!
they belong to Emilina Saffron. So do the drugs we found in the food.
cross-referenced them with her prescriptions and her medical records.
if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go geta warrant.
where am I?
Hello? Hey, I need my bag!
Oh... Mr. Bean.
thank god it's you.
I really need my bag, please.
and I need a confession.
I have a kid in Milwaukee.
the father's Samoan.
can I now please have my bag, Tony Randall?
I was thinking something more along the lines of...
I tried to killnigel st. Nigel "by poisoning his tuna nicoise salad sandwich "with a dangerous cocktail of prescription medications I happen to carry with meat all times.
unquote.
I have no idea what you just said.
you're an even worse liar than my ex-wife.
ex-wife?
well, I mean, we're separated.
Oh. So what you're trying to tell me is that you gota little hole in your heart?
come on. Fill it with saffron.
Okay--you know, I'm gonna go get a bite.
and, uh, you think long and hardabout what you did.
and I'll come back, say, sometime tomorrow afternoon.
I need my bag!
Oh, I know. Don't worry.
I'll take good care of it.
no, I need my bag now!
I don't know, detective.
Oh, come on. Please don't tell me you're buying this dog and pony show.
it's an act. It's the perfect cover-up.
well, it's pretty convincing.
Oh, she's good. But I'm better.
I'm gonna crack her like a bad back.
please don't.
Mr. Bean, I need my bag.
damn, girl!
it's okay, Jules.
you can be straight with us. We can handle it.
Really?'Cause that was awful.
awful? - Can I teach you how to Krump?
maybe. That's up to you.
but I can't reach inside of you and make you want this.
I mean, absolutely need this.
the way that both Hall and Oatesused to need it.
well, Oates a little bit more, probably.
this has to comefrom inside here.
and deep, deep, deep... inside here.
you do realize that there is a suspect in custody, and the case is just about closed.
is that what this laissez-faire, half-baked effort is about, huh--the case?
I thought you were into win it!
Jules, are you feeling okay?
sharp as cheddar.
you know, I wouldn't put all my eggs in Emilina's basket, Shawn.
she's barely lucid enough to form word endings, much less plan a series of attacks on Nigel's life.
she could be like Keyser Soze.
with one shoe.
I think... until we get a confession, we gotta keep our eyeson the prize.
now let's take it back to the broken melting robot, huh?
Gus--watch me!
she'll be coming
instant noodles, danish, diet coke.
took you long enough.
I assumed that you were dead.
you see what I'm reduced to?
I can't even eat real food.
I'll take the noodles if you don't want them.
Oh, bugger off, you silly giraffe.
is something burning in here?
what is that?
you all right?
peachy.
now let me go.
are we there yet?
I feel like I've been incarcerated in a blueberry.
this car makes me want to weep and then die.
you asked for a safe house where absolutely no one can find you.
that means we have to venture off the beaten path just a little.
relax.
good lord!
who lives here?
the Boringtons?
there's a better-than-decent chance this goes poorly.
I don't care. I'm starving.
wait!
Hey! Hey, I remember something!
hurry up, I'm lucid.
I'm not kidding. Come in here right now and bring my bag.
Hello?
come on! Come on, count Chocula! I know you're in there!
don't make me pee on something.
again!
well, it took you long enough. I'm dying in here.
Yeah, it's called withdrawal. Are you ready to confess?
no, see, that's the thing.
first of all, I remember somebody getting into my purse yesterday.
when? - I don't remember.
but I was sleeping, and they were diggin' around in my purse right in front of me.
well, who was it?
I can't be sure.
I thought I was dreaming.
but it might've been a werewolf.
might've been?
I wasn't even at the hotel this morning!
I slept on a carin the parking lot.
that makes me innocent.
you slept on a car?
well, yeah. It--it's a long story.
I usually sleep in the lifeguard station, but I didn't want to make a scene, so...
your fingerprints are all over Nigel's room.
we hook up sometimes.
I went to his room yesterday to see if he was lonely.
it was a moment of weakness.
a girl's got needs.
all right, gentlemen.
prepare to taste the most succulent, evenly-marinated beef that you have ever.
is that my robe?
it is indeed, Horace.
and it is comforting me at an elite spa level.
I think I should also point out that I'm absolutely famished and those filets actually smell promising.
sweet. - That's what I'm talking about.
it's Henry.
they're rib eyes.
is there a problem?
well, look at it.
it's still got the marks where the jockey was hitting it.
you're free.
parking lot attendants confirmed your alibi.
so I can go?
the sooner the better.
and for god's sakes, take a shower.
I'll never forget you.
what was your name again?
nose hair trimmer.
invest.
can you even remember what it felt like to be able to move the muscles in your face?
who decorated this place?
Kris， Kris Tofferson?
is that--damn!
I built that table. - Really?
I'm pretty sure if I were to build a table, I would start by using wood that had never drifted.
all right, you know--that's it.
already? I'm just getting started.
I've got a sonnet for each piece of fish paraphernalia.
Oh, yeah? Well I got an ice-cold can of whip-ass just sitting in that fridge!
actually, that's diet whip-ass.
you must be outof your damn mind!
dude, you have three full cobs!
I will slap you, Shawn.
now, tell me-- are you absolutely certain that this cow shoulder on my plate is in fact dead?
I'm just asking.
that's it--take off the robe!
wearing that robeis a privilege and you, pal, have just lost it!
I stead fastly refuse.
this is the plushiest, most opulent robe I've ever had the pleasure of wearing.
well, there's one thing we could agree on.
now give it up. - No.
I feel like an angel baby swaddled in a cocoon of cloud candy.
you either take it off, or I'll take it off for you.
dad, I don't think you're thinking this through.
Shawn! - Dad!
I'm pretty sure he's going commando under
keep playin', shawn. Go ahead.
what kind of sick bastardgoes commando underneath another man's robe?
all right, all right.
come with me. Come with me! Come on.
dad, just walk it off.
he's not staying here. He violated basic robe code.
robe code violation--check.
look, Shawn, there's a reason this guy's on the run.
he's been here ten minutes, even I want to kill him!
that's the problem, dad. How do I protect him from everybody?
you've already got a suspect in jail.
she was just released. Now we have a plethoraof suspects and no way to narrow them down.
it's easy; tighten your focus. Who does he victimize the most?
is that peach cobbler in the fridge for everybody?
I'm sorry. Not today.
I don't think so.
I showed him!
it'll all go away.
hmm. You think it's funny?
naughty!
I hope you havesome food in there.
Mr. Spencer, Mr. Guster, I'm afraid I have some unfortunate news.
Emilina Saffron was found in the bathroom of her hotel suite this morning.
she was clinging to life and has been rushed to St. Thomas of the apostles.
and so far all signs point to an overdose of some sort.
but we are fully investigatingthe matter.
overdose?
she injected herself with enough tranquilizers to kill an adult rhinoceros.
but how did she escape?
Mr. St. Nigel, ms. Saffron was released this morning, after her alibi checked out.
she is the last person that you should be worried about now.
we have to cancel the show.
are you kidding?
look, I don't want to seem insensitive, but this is the third time this season she's been in the ICU.
not like this.
I will not go on.
I'll be a sitting duck out there.
I will personally oversee your security detail, Mr. St. Nigel.
we'll all be out there together.
you'll be just fine. Suck it up.
now I gotta bolt. I'm way late for my pilates.
Lester Beacon sure didn't seem too broken up about Emilina.
he sure didn't.
Plus, his hair.
Shawn, we're in a hallway-- staying close to the wall doesn't make us invisible.
agree to disagree.
you have a plan yet?
Gus, I'm a lyrical gangster.
I'll use some colorful vernacular and if necessary, you'll engage in fisticuffs.
that was close. - Too close.
huh. No guard.
we did all that sneaking around because you thought they put a guard at Emilina's empty hotel room?
seemed like a decent theory at the time.
you better have the key.
what are we looking for?
beats me.
damn.
seems clean.
that's what you get for drinking whole milk, Shawn.
dude, I have bones like granite.
and we just got ourselves a clue.
what is it?
reach in there and fish it out.
I'm not putting my handin there. You do it.
Gus, I found it. You get it. That's how it works.
I'm not putting my hand in Emilina Saffron's toilet water, Shawn.
I'm getting some really serious vibrations here.
they're coming from Emilina's hotel room.
you gotta get us in there as soon as possible.
Oh, and, uh...bring gloves.
Oh, my god!
it's just as I imagined.
Oh, I am feeling something in here.
right here?
did you bring the gloves?
Yeah, I brought the gloves. Why do I need gloves?
I feel...a sparkle.
that!
wow, Shawn, that's amazing.
how did you know that?
I feel things...deeply.
Yeah.
I need to speak with Emilina right away.
she's mostly comatose, Shawn.
we probably won't know the difference.
all right.
dude!
that crystal was on the- -I know!
go back to the office, see if you can get some info on him.
right.
knock, knock! You have a visitor.
what is spencer doing here?
look, I insisted.
Emilina's my favorite judge.
I used to havesuch a crush on her in high school.
you know, before she started eating glue and what not.
has she said anything?
no. Not yet.
but I will be right here when she does.
I can tell you that.
that's... very gentle.
I misjudged her.
she was innocent.
crying out for help in her own sad, potentially disease-ridden way.
I cut her off at the arms.
judged the book by its filthy, loathsome... wickedly erotic cover.
look at me!
I'm here, baby.
look... at me!
I think she's tryingto tell us something.
that someone's looking at her?
I was looking at her.
I should take this.
get ready to be happy, Shawn.
did you find him?
I didn't just find him.
I found him, found him, found him, and found him.
I knew this dude looked familiar.
he's been at every stage of the competition in every city, doing his best william hung at every stop.
okay, let's try that again, and leave out the reference you know means nothing to me.
he's singing badlyon purpose, shawn, knowing full well he wouldn't advance.
that way he could re-enter the competition in every city at every stop.
that's nefarious.
but he couldn't have done this on his own.
now we just have to figure out who's helping him from the inside.
Emilina just said, "look at me"from her hospital bed.
how does that help us? - Dude-- Look at me!
wait!
ten-year-old Bevin Rennie Llywellen?
what the... oh, my god!
what? What? We have a match?
please, accept our apologies.
we just thought you all might want to know that you're in the presence of a homicidal sociopath.
no, no, no! He's not crazy.
no, we got a doctor's note and everything.
just, um... dropped some...items.
chief, so glad you're here.
I know who's beentrying to kill Nigel.
and who was trying to take out Emilina.
and who tried to take out Emilina.
Mr. Spencer, last time I checked, Emilina over dosed on her own prescription medication.
that's precisely what Bevin Rennie Llywellen wanted you to think.
that's really his name?
that's the wanker who auditioned in every city.
just another slice of deception.
the truth is, he can sing like a bird.
but if you heard that, he wouldn't have to reaudition in every city on the tour.
every city that you almost died in, Nigel.
and after Emilina was released, he tried to silence her for good before she could put it all together.
put what together?
and who might this be, detectives?
meet Bevin Rennie Llywellen.
ms. Saffron woke up out of her coma, rabbit-punched me in the sternum, and remembered this guy as one of her assailants.
this crystal puts him at the scene of the crime.
so he made an attempt on Emilina's life.
allegedly poisoned a tuna salad sandwich.
uh, tuna nicoise saladsandwich, chief.
there's a difference.
but what about all the other near misses with Nigel?
but it can't be him. It's impossible.
he was just a contestant.
sounds like he hadsomebody on the inside.
he had somebodyon the inside.
didn't he?
Oh. Don't be ridiculous.
Zapato adores me.
plus he can't even think.
Oh, it has to be someone else.
um, how about Lester?
Oh, I'd love to see him in prison.
Bevin is Zapato's biggest fan.
they actually became pretty good friends.
and I don't think this show turned out to be quite the come back either of them were hoping for.
I could go on.
but why don't you take the floor?
well, what could he say?
he can't even speak.
Yes, I can!
but you don't let me.
I was the first to sign on.
this was supposed to be my show!
my shot, my comeback!
you turned me into a simp.
I freakin' hate you!
people don't even know who I am.
I get fan letters addressed to Geraldo, Ricky Martin, and that guy from El Pollo Loco commercial!
you ruined everything!
why won't you die?
Really?
that was your plan?
that has to be the poorest-executed attack in history.
I was two feet away from you all the time.
I mean, you have to be solutely, without doubt, the worst murderer I have ever seen.
did you-- Mira me your world is wireless.
are you ready, Santa Barbara, for the next two contestants on American duos?
all right, give it up for shawn spence starrand Gus tt Showbizz!
great job, gentlemen. Now let's see what our judge thought.
come on over.
sit.
what, are you kidding me?
you look like a couple of rodeo clowns up there.
nothing was in synch.
your hairstyles are ridiculous.
you butchered a terrific song, and it's time you went home.
please, spare us additional torture and just... euthanize yourselves.
excuse me.
welcome to stone age day
Where's your project, Shawn?
did you even do it?
my project?
of course I did it.
Uh-huh. When?
when?
last night.
it's right here.
this head is to exact scale.
it took me three months to make it.
yours took five minutes.
no, Gus, you're totally wrong.
it took me a whole hour.
check this out.
I hate you, Shawn.
present day
Lompoc.
okay, I did it.
that's seven in row.
eight. --The gas station guy confessed last week!
Oh, I wouldn't call myself a hero.
I'm just doing my job just like all of you.
Hey, that's enough goofing off.
let's get back to work, huh?
you too.
ladies and gentlemen, detective Lassiter!
Oh, stop it!
is there a problem?
with what?
with you. With me. With the chief.
she hasn't called in a month.
is she still mad about me requisitioning the Segway?
you did that?
no.
well, I don't really have time right now, but the short answer is we just haven't really needed any outside help.
well, what's the long answer?
I mean, throw a "but" in there and add something about a dream where you and I got thrown out of a mattress showroom.
detective Lassiteris literally on fire.
what kind of fire are we talking about?
michael Jackson in the pepsi commercial fire or misusing the word "literally" fire?
he's solved eight cases in a row fire.
nine. --I just remembered the Deshano case.
Hey, Shawn. What's new?
you still doing the psychic thing?
is this some sort of weird dream?
on the last two cases, the first suspect Lassiter questioned confessed.
it's really magnificent.
we are talking about Carlton Lassiter, right?
yea high?
bats ninth for the department softball team?
tenth. We play with a rover.
Spencer, long time, no see.
or is that no need?
I can't believe this.
Oh, believe it. It's real.
they've done a preliminary on the body down at the Marina, detective.
they're ready for you at the scene.
well, I would love to stay and chat, but duty does call.
Oh, Spencer, you look so sad.
come on, we'll show you how real cops do it.
no comeback?
Shawn, that's slightly embarrassing.
Where'd you get that...suit?
the toilet store?
good luck with this one, detective.
there's no identification.
nobody's been reported missing fitting this description.
Oh, Mr. Spencer.
I'm surprised you didn't take the Segway.
she did know about that.
O'hara just told me.
traitor.
I'll deal with you later.
so what's the newcase we've got?
a slight error in grammar there, buddy. - Which part?
got.
I came all the way down from the office, Shawn.
Gus, don't be a giant snapping turtle.
we'll have a case in five minutes.
nobody can explain these puncture wounds.
we can't rule out an animal attack.
no...no, there's nothing in these waters with a bite radius that large.
no, this is maybe a...boating accident.
the wounds caused by some machinery.
I can't really be sure at this juncture.
completely stumped.
you getting something, Mr. Spencer?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
no, no, no! No, hold on. Okay, I've got it.
the wound on the head was caused by the edge of a boat when he fell in the water unconscious.
and the wounds on the back, they were caused by a large industrial crab trap.
or a whale.
it definitely could've been a whale.
lost from his pod.
separated, migrating north or south.
and sees our man dead, already floating upabove the surface.
thinks it's a seal and then. --Whale.
a whale?
what's your guy got?
watch and learn, Jules.
watch and learn.
or-- - detective, if you don't mind, I'd like to see what Mr. Spencer has to offer.
all right, look, this is gonna be a little rough, okay?
I didn't have time for shading.
there's no forced perspective.
if I had really had my druthers, I would've done it in charcoal.
you know what I'm talking about.
look, what I'm trying to say is, I'm not the artist. I'd like to be -
okay, Mr. Spencer, enough.
can you or can you not tell us who's responsible for this man's death?
if I can present you with a semi-accurate sketch of the culprit, is that enough to get us on this case?
Yes.
all right.
the puncture wounds.
they're the key.
giving me the impression that this crime could only have been committed by this guy.
this guy here.
excuse me.
what?
chief?
where are you off to?
so what, that's a no?
this is not a boating accident.
you're mad.
no, I'm not mad.
I'm happy.
I'm thrilled.
I love looking like an idiot.
well, that explains your shoes.
you almost closed down our agency with that little act of yours, Shawn.
me?
you're the one spending all your extra time at your little "side project."
you mean my real job?
soon to be my only job?
Gus, you're panicking. Don't panic.
those bite marks are consistent with a tyrannosaurus bite.
you know that. - Yes, I know that.
the hard way.
I was canned from the Wyoming Natural History Museum for that little shot.
the bruises from the teeth didn't go away for a year, but totally worth it.
it was my best screensaver ever.
Gus, please, connecting a dinosaur to this case is the least of our worries.
look, I can stash a toy dinosaur in the window of the killer.
I can link him to a box of dino bites or fruity pebbles.
I can play six degrees of dinosaur with you right now.
you've never been in a movie with Kevin Bacon or a dilaposaurus, have you?
how about you play six degrees of kiss my ass?
first of all, that sounds like a totally disturbing game.
what's weird is that my guess on the jaw radius was actually spot on.
it almost seems to make sense.
so now you're getting on board with your own joke theory?
how are you gonna match your bite radius to the victim, Shawn?
drag the body to the Wyoming museum?
I can do you one better.
what?
I need to borrow my dad's truck.
you coming or what?
that's clearly a no.
the one thing we can be sure of is the cause of death was not drowning.
blunt force trauma to the head was severe enough to knock him unconscious.
more than likely he fell from some sort of a platform after knocking himself on the head.
and this is how he ended up in the water?
no, he landed on something hard.
dislocated a rib.
he has bruises consistent with a six, seven, or eight-foot fall.
my guess is that he landed on something else and ultimately expired before tumbling into the water.
you know, this might be a leap, but I would check the offshore oil rigs.
see if any of them are missing workers.
I'll make some calls.
interesting, detective.
Thanks, chief.
this theory feels good. Just makes sense.
the work boots, the odd configuration of the wounds.
you know us, Ted. It's worth a shot, right?
we don't go out on limbs too often...
Thanks, guys. I just need to measure something.
Oh, good!
you're all here.
get ready to be shocked.
can we get the sheet off the dead guy, please?
confirming the bite radius...
No!
Mr. Spencer-- - Whoa, hey, hey, be careful.
this isn't mine.
Mr. Spencer, your antics have always been a little-- let's say unorthodox.
but let me be as frank as I can be with my assessment of your most recent behavior.
seek help.
chief, sometimes you have to jump off a cliff.
you have to close your eyes.
you have to unhook your clip "chasses." -- chassis?
climbing thing...
and you have to leap.
now I ask you, chief...
will you leap with me?
are you thinking about jumping off a cliff?
maybe.
yo!
dad!
I've brought the keys back.
Hello!
okay, this is creepy. Why is Gus here?
why do you think, Shawn?
he's a hostage.
perhaps I can shed some light on that.
two hostages.
Doug Devette is an old colleague of mine from the force.
the chief asked me to have him drop by.
Why?
Doug is the department psychologist, Shawn.
what is this, some sort of intervention?
Yeah, sort of.
we don't like to use the term "intervention," Shawn.
Gus? - Don't look at me.
I'm here for the cupcakes.
dad, I am not on drugs.
Oh, nobody thinks that, Shawn.
well, I'm not completely sure about that, Doug.
we're all just a little concerned that you might be stretching yourself a bit too thin.
it wasn't my idea, but he's right, Shawn.
you're acting like a nut job.
just because I take Gus' giant dinosaur head down to a dead body does not make me a nut job.
what?
you took my T-rex?
my mom gave it to you? - Gladly.
she also gave me some pictures you can pay me to not show your next girlfriend.
what pictures?
the ones that document your Terence Trent Darby phase.
whatever, Shawn.
you took Danny Dino to the police station?
no, Gus, give me some credit.
I took him to the morgue.
good news.
your specifications were spot on.
your father tells me you have delusions of magical powers.
delusions?
really.
Doug, I'm employed as a psychic.
I've solved18 cases this year.
I have business cards and a personalized coffee mug that backs up the whole thing.
I feel things about people.
you, for instance, are color blind.
that's nothing to be ashamed off.
you're also really stressed about something.
college.
it can be very expensive, Doug.
Oh, wow, that was good, Henry.
Doug, do not be a stooge.
not a stooge, but in this one case, he was right.
knock at door.
Karen, do you mind? We're in the middle of an intervention here.
we don't have time for that. - But you're the one who asked for this.
and I thank you, Henry, but I'm afraid that this can't wait.
we just got a break in the case.
we just found out the name of the dead man.
you want to tell him who he is, detective?
no.
his name was Christopher Franzen.
he is a paleontologist.
a dinosaur hunter.
as expected.
pleasure was all mine.
Oh, no, Shawn, mine.
we should get together.
all right, here's what we know so far.
a man, a paleontology professor, washes ashore with wounds specific to a dinosaur.
I don't think we can rule out the possibility of island somewhere in the pacific where dinosaurs do exist.
and have an appetite for Jeff Goldblum.
I'm being serious, Shawn.
well, look who's Mr. Onboard and sounding like a whacked wombat.
then what is it? - I don't know.
it actually scares me that my wild dinosaur reach landed so close to the bull's-eye.
this guy was possibly killed by something dinosaur-related, but it was probably a model or something from the archaeology department.
we'll have to spend the better part of the next 24 hours sifting through their entire collection of artifacts.
and by "we" I mean mostly you.
this is all there is?
no. No, no, no. This is just the big stuff.
we got the trilobites in a shoebox, but the shelfis kind of high.
you've got pinhead, chatter box, surgeon, and stitch up there on a shelf?
Shawn, those are cenobites.
Oh. Well, what are trilobites?
fish fossils.
Oh, Gus, for my sake, at least pretend like you don't know this stuff off the top of your head.
do this move.
Trilo--trilobite?
What--it'll help you! I'm serious.
look, Ethan, I can honestly say there were more historically significant items in the lost and found at the Taco John's in Porterville.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's a little sad.
word is the whole program is going under.
you sure about that?
look, professor Franzen would never really give us a straight answer.
in fact, most nights he wasn't around to give us any answers.
he was a pretty crappy advisor.
and when he did show up, he was late, tired, completely disheveled.
nobody really trusted the guy.
look, do not ever take a class from him.
he's dead.
Oh, yeah.
then totally.
well, this sure was a dead end.
Yep, but at least we were the first ones to find the dead end.
Oh, come on!
he really is on fire. Literally.
I don't get this.
the cops beat us to the dead guy's house.
I don't know how I feel about the police department being so proactive.
feeling the heat?
what, do you think I'm afraid of a little competition?
I know you're afraid of competition.
why else would you have purposefully broken the battle zone at Pizza Royale?
dude, you beat me once.
and only because you first used the eyepiece and then revealed you had pinkeye.
let's venture off the beaten path.
what's wrong?
I'm just trying to figure out what to do here, since as a rule we don't break and enter.
what do you mean we don't break and enter?
the 2400 motel.
the hotel De La Cruz.
the spell master's box.
Yeah, but we really shouldn't pick this lock.
you know I want to pick that lock.
Yes, I do.
watch out.
what are you, the lock whisperer?
are you channeling Michael Jackson? - Shh!
who heard the second click?
I heard the second click.
Really?
come on.
I can't see anything.
Oh, I got it, I got it.
Aah! Gus, that thing is brighter than the sun.
think you just gave me glaucoma.
you can't give some one glaucoma.
thank you.
Wow. This is better than the entire university department.
it sure is.
and his digging equipment is some heavy duty stuff.
looks like some shovels are missing.
part of a portable light kit.
a lot of brushes.
and fine finishing equipment, which I would assume he was only using in the lab.
dude, I got something. - What?
he was the worst tic-tac-toe player in the history of the world.
I'm investigating and you're analyzing his doodles?
doodles are the window to the soul, Gus.
or maybe that's the epiglottis.
Where's the uvula?
Lassiter's here.
that guy's like five minutes behind us everywhere we go.
don't sleep in the nude tonight.
enjoying your time riding my behind?
definitely not in the nude.
this lock looks too high tech for a backyard shed.
we gotta find somebody who can crack the code.
there's already someone here who can do that.
that person...is me.
well, make yourself useful.
I'll need you to step back, please.
give me some room to operate.
further, please. Further.
Jules, could you help me out here?
just get him back onto the cobblestone.
that's good, that's good.
thank you.
I am sensing the first two digits.
what is it, 31?
Gus, help me out here. Come on, buddy.
you can have my Tony Gwynn rookie.
And...two.
there's one more.
wait!
there's one more.
that was amazing.
I'll give you that one.
can't see a thing in here. - Oh, I've got it.
wait, I'm sensing a light switch.
tools are missing.
good work, detective.
he had a blunt force trauma.
that could be supplied by one of these missing items.
maybe this rock hammer or this medium shovel.
but where would they be?
the bed of his pickup.
it wasn't parked out front or at the university.
we find that truck, we find the murder weapon.
let's go, O'hara.
burning daylight.
excuse us.
man, you missed the truck?
I'm not the psychic.
Ojai ROADSIDE FRUITS BRAND
what?
why would someone frequent a fruit stand that's over 50 miles away?
they like pomegranate?
Yeah, I know him.
he was my best customer.
don't know his name.
but he comes by every night before closing.
did you ever see which way he went?
Yeah.
always up the hill.
that's all I see.
although every once in a while I see him come back down the hill early in the morning.
well, thank you very much.
Gus, you got anything else?
Yes, is that peach pie in the back?
Yeah.
deacon WALKER FARMS NO TRESPASSING
another dead end.
let's turn around.
hold on a second.
this looks like a place someone's been sneaking into.
what is this?
looks like some kind of farmland or grazing plain.
Oh, look at that.
it's like that movie. The one with Sigourney Weaver.
aliens? - No.
alien. - No.
alien: Resurrection.
Gus, the one with the holes and Shia Labeouf.
they had holes in Shia Labeouf?
the holes are in the ground, dude, like that.
and Jon Woight was walking around all crazy.
Oh, Anaconda.
Yeah, never mind.
gorillas in the Mist?
death and the Maiden? - No!
half Moon Street? - Just let it go.
I'll be damned.
What?! Somebody's shooting at us!
Oh, god! They're shooting! We're gonna die!
run, Gus!
Gus, run like the wind!
No--get--get up!
come on, get in the car!
hurry up, Shawn!
start it, start it!
go, go, go!
dude, look at the road while you're driving!
I'm staying down for safety.
he was shooting directly into the air, Gus.
bullets go up. They have to come down.
do you know what the trajectory would have to be for that to happen?
don't you dare argue physics with me.
not while we're in the process of almost being killed.
trespassers WILL BE SHOT PRIVATE PROPERTY
didn't you see the "trespassers will be shot" sign?
Oh, yeah.
it totally said that.
my bad.
Mr. Spencer, if you haveany substantial information concerning the Christopher Franzen case, please get on with it.
I've got something.
it's a cluck.
a cluck?
Bawk...baaawk!
actually there's two.
two clucks.
a cluck-cluck here.
a bawk-bawk...there.
here a bawk.
there a-- - cluck?
everywhere a bawk-baaawk.
let me guess. You have a name.
macdonald, perhaps?
no. No, it's a farm.
with an farmer. An old farmer.
Farmer...shooty pants.
that's a nickname. I don't think that's his actual handle.
I've got it.
Lassiter found the paleontologist's truck.
you helped.
I did help. It was his hunch.
it was down at the old marina.
I just had a feeling.
I also found the prints of a certain grad student named Ethan Robinson along with a stack of letters from said grad students demanding the professor stop ruining his life.
we're sending a car over to pick him up.
Oh, I'm sorry.
am I interrupting your trance?
I don't buy it.
which part?
the damning evidence or the murder weapon?
there's more going on in this guy's life.
chief, I'm sensing...
digging.
Yeah, the archaeology department was going under.
he was trying to make a big discovery.
put him on the map, get more funding.
the farm.
I can see the name of the farm.
it's Wallll...Wallll... - Walker farms.
Yeah, we got that lead off the phone records yesterday.
apparently our victim made a series of phone calls to the farmer trying to buy some of his land, but it wasn't for sale.
farmer was forthcoming, cooperative.
definitely not a suspect.
anything else?
I have to say, you have been very thorough.
we're just doing what any good cops would do.
Shawn, what are you doing?
Yeah, what are we doing, Shawn?
I need to borrow some tools.
what kind of tools?
digging tools.
a little excavation project we got going on.
are you still on that dinosaur thing?
we're still on that dinosaur thing?
what, is there an echo in here?
Yes, we're still on the dinosaur thing.
we step foot on the far end of this guy Walker's farm in Ojai and he starts blasting us with buckshot.
we know our dead guy was there every night leading up to his death, digging around the periphery of this property.
no, Shawn, wait.
I don't want you borrowing my tools.
Oh, Gus will leave his class ring as collateral. - No, I won't.
Yes, you will. - No, I won't.
sure you will. - No, I won't.
I can't support this.
well, there's a shocker.
you not being supportive.
would you shut up and listen?
I'm saying I can't support you going somewhere where you could get shot.
what, are you-- are you worried about me?
Shawn, I've been worried about you since you were three years old and started eating your own toenails.
well, dad, I'll be fine, okay?
we're not gonna go anywhere near the house.
and if it'll make you feel any better, I will stand behind Gus the entire time.
no, you won't. - Yes, I will.
no, you won't. - Oh, yes, I will.
you want to bet?
I don't like it.
it doesn't feel right.
I know feelings.
pardon me?
did--did you just say "I know feelings?"
perfect.
this will be easy.
Oh, there's a pattern here.
those guys dig with a reason.
how do you know that?
Gus, I worked at the museum for almost an entire weekend before I got canned.
he was the worst tic-tac-toe player in the history of the world.
wait a second.
those weren't tic-tac-toe boards.
those were all the places he'd dug.
there were like 25 xs.
no way he scored that often.
the xs were misses.
in this case,"O" makes the spot.
and that's the "O."
this is the only hole filled by a bulldozer.
no self-respecting paleontologist would use a bulldozer.
why do you know that?
because, Shawn, if you use a bull-- - Gus, I don't actually want to know.
then don't ask.
here.
this shouldn't take long. Grab a shovel.
and keep an eye out for that farmer.
how you doing on your side?
good, solid.
I'm holding up.
Shawn! - What?
I'm keeping watch.
that's how the other guy died.
what, you're not concerned?
all right, I get it!
it's my turn.
this is the end of the loose dirt. Be careful.
this is weird.
what, that there's rocks in the ground?
these aren't rocks.
these are fossils.
but they've been processed, finished off, residue, rocks chipped away.
stuff you would normally do in a lab.
franzen found something.
why wouldn't he just take it out and do the work in the lab where it should be done?
unless...
unless it was too big to move.
Oh, dude, I'm gonna get the leaf blower.
you brought a leaf blower?
you gotta be kidding me.
I just discovered a dinosaur.
filling that hole was the worst idea ever.
Un-uh. It had to be done, Gus.
we have to save it for when we unmask Franzen's killer.
I still don't get it.
he was on the trail of a fossil graveyard.
it lead him right to deacon farms.
farmer wouldn't let him dig on the land, so he takes matters into his own hands after hours.
but why wouldn't the farmer let him dig?
maybe he didn't want this farm disturbed.
a dig like that is worth millions to a land owner.
and the fossils I discovered weren't even on crop land.
you discovered?
don't try to take away my dinosaur discovery, Shawn.
I wouldn't dream of it.
I'm sorry. It was all you.
I'm very proud of you.
don't you think once they unearth that thing there would be a swarm of people crashing in from all over the world?
why didn't he just lease the land?
I don't get it.
I've got an idea.
what?
let's ask him.
What?!
we're pretty sure we just found a cold-blooded murderer, and you want to go to his house and ask him about it?
we can ask nicely. - No!
all right, all right.
we come up with a cover story.
we're vacuum salesmen.
No...traveling gypsies.
no, no, no!
we'll do of Mice and Men.
I'm Lennie. - No.
George, you said that I could take care of those rabbits, George. - Shawn.
and later on you're gonna cook those beets. - Shawn!
beets make me go-- - No Lennie.
Gus, you know how long I've been waiting to pull out my Lennie?
no, Shawn, we do the National Paleontology Society thing as agreed.
and we keep it very, very simple.
it's not as much fun as whipping out my Lennie.
and why are we stopping here?
have you tried these peaches?
you're back.
Yes, sir, we are.
we're addicted to your citrus.
peaches aren't citrus, Shawn.
they're stone fruit.
it's the same thing. - No, not the same thing.
they have pits.
peaches, cherries, plums, and apricots.
I can't do this with you right now.
does your fruit come from Walker farms?
Oh, no. We grow on our own little parcel of land.
deacon Walker's farm used to be a supplier of ours years ago, but they don't grow nearly as much as they used to.
thank you so much for your information.
if you have a moment, my friend and I would like to buy every peach on that truck.
including the one you're eating.
you sure you don't want to do of Mice and Men?
you so much as slur one word, I'll give you an Indian burn so hot your socks will catch fire.
indian burn.
I haven't been threatened with that this millennium.
take a shot if your ulna feels safe.
I don't think the ulna's in the forearm.
trust me, it is.
how can you Indian burn a bone?
stop analyzing my threat.
get it right. - I got it right.
is Deacon Walker home?
there is no Deacon Walker.
Hmph. That's confusing.
I've got nothing. Gus?
then why name the farm Deacon Walker Farms?
because it used to be called Deacon Walker.
Roger Deacon was my partner.
he's not anymore.
that cleans it up nicely.
maybe we come in? - No.
what do you want?
we're from the National Paleontological Society.
not interested.
clearly he's not interested.
we would like to make you a very sizeable offer on a very small portion of your.
Hello, my name is Lennie. I like to...
you think he'd open up if we knocked again?
I'm glad it only took us an hour to get up here.
not like I wasted a whole day.
franzen dug up here too?
no, he didn't.
these are all new and dug with a bulldozer.
a real paleontologist-- - would never use such an indelicate tool.
I got it.
so our farmer's been digging too.
right.
but if the gold mine's out there, why is he digging over here?
it's my dad.
think he wants his leaf blower back?
Shawn, you're not anywhere near that farmhouse, are you?
dad, how dare you? Of course not.
good. Stay away, Shawn.
I know where I remember that farm.
deacon Walker Farm.
I was up there about 20 years ago.
a girl reported that her boyfriend went missing.
he was a partner in the farm.
he was never found, Shawn.
never found?
that's right, the farmer claimed he went back to England or some nonsense.
the point is, we never found out where he went.
uh, I think I might know where he is.
where?
I might be looking at him.
gotta go.
God
dude. - What?
it now appears a lot of our evidence is circumstantial.
we're checking the grad student's alibi, but I'm not as confident as I like to be.
Shawn Spencer's on line one.
what does he want?
he wants us to go meet him in the Ojai valley somewhere.
we're in the middle of the Franzen case.
I told him that.
he guarantees that in ten minutes he can solve the case, nab the killer, close an additional unsolved murder, and...
and what?
unearth a dinosaur.
well...I'm curious.
this is as far as my property goes.
that's all there is.
well, I've answered all your questions, detective.
what more do you want from me?
I'm not entirely sure, sir.
we just have one more person we need you to talk to.
don't even ask.
my name is not Lennie, Mr. Walker.
but if it were, I would've been amazing.
no, you wouldn't have.
would've brought tears, Gus.
guys, the point?
the truth is I'm a psychic.
I work for the SBPD.
and the mystic vibrations of the sea have brought me here to solve not one, but two murders.
you're a what?
christopher Franzen was a persistent annoyance, huh?
he couldn't help it.
his department was going under.
he was desperate to find something significant to save his career.
and he knew that your property held the key.
but you wouldn't let him dig.
you couldn't let him dig.
so he did what any self-respecting paleontologist on the verge of a nervous breakdown would do.
he dug anyway.
secretly.
under the blanket of night.
and into the early morning.
and he dug, and he dug, and he found something.
and that's when you found him.
you knew the magnitude of the find.
once word got out, you'd never be able to keep the rest of the world from digging here too.
and you couldn't have the rest of the world digging here either, could you?
dad? What are youd oing here?
I was worried about my tools.
what?
if I had known you were finally smart enough to bring some backup, I wouldn't have had to come up here, Shawn.
Shawn, will you tell them why Walker wouldn't let him dig?
deacon is buried on the property!
dad!
dad, you just blew the big reveal.
you already mentioned his name, Shawn.
they don't know that Deacon was the partner Walker killed 20 years ago.
Hey, now wait a minute here-- - he what now?
Yeah, he killed Deacon and he buried him somewhere on the farm and he can't remember where.
isn't that right, farmer shooty pants?
I don't have to stand here and take this.
no, actually you do.
what does this have to do with Christopher Franzen?
he killed Franzen when he caught him standing above his dinosaur skull discovery, sending him flying right into the teeth of the dinosaur.
but he couldn't bury him here.
no, no, no, he had called the farm.
he had snooped around the farm.
there was a trail to the farm.
no, he had to dump him somewhere where there'd be no forensics.
like the ocean.
just let the salt water clean the corpse and wash it ashore.
and the murder scene.
well, he hopped on his handy bulldozer and filled the hole.
I'm getting a bad feeling about your streak.
you too, huh?
I think I need a lawyer.
I think you're right.
put your hands behind your back. - What?
you heard me.
you still haven't answered the question why he dug all the holes around the house, Shawn.
dad, that's the finale.
that's why I don't invite you to these things.
he was looking for Deacon's body. Whatever.
are we done here, Mr. Spencer?
no, we're not done.
for my final demonstration, I will now...discover a dinosaur.
Actually...Gus will discover a dinosaur.
wait a second.
you just want me to dig this hole. - I do not.
I'm not falling for that, Shawny boy. You dig it.
I'll take credit for the discovery. - Oh, no, you won't.
give me that shovel.
whoa, whoa, whoa! It's too late.
you blew it. - What?!
and whoever discovers it gets to name it.
I'm naming him Zippy.
or Chompy.
zippy the dinosaur, discovered by psychicpaleo-sleuth Shawn Spencer!
give me this shovel, Shawn!
killed by a dinosaur.
and he's right.
it was an actual dinosaur.
technically, it's the fall that killed him.
not helping.
Oh, come on.
who am I kidding? I am doomed.
I am never gonna suspect an extinct creature.
how can I compete with that?
you don't have to compete.
O'hara, I am physically incapable of pointing the finger at a dragon or a leprechaun or the loch ness monster.
I quit. I'm gonna donate my badge to charity.
it was a good run, Carlton.
all streaks have to end.
Lou Boudreau fielded the ball cleanly.
you have to let it go.
who the hell is Lou Boudreau?
he recorded the out that ended Dimaggio's hit streak.
don't you watch baseball? - Of course I watch baseball.
I just don't know meaningless facts from 75 years ago.
66
you disturb me.
do you need a hug? - Oh, what do I look like?
Yeah, I'll take the hug.
okay, thanks. - Okay.
Oh, come on, you guys.
we're still doing this intervention thing?
Yes, yes, Shawn, we are.
son, you have no sense of responsibility.
and lately you've been purposefully putting yourself in a severe amount of unnecessary danger.
on top of which, you are constantly be littling the good work of -
actually, Henry, I stretched the truth a bit.
this isn't about Shawn.
this is about you. - What?
can we talk about your obsessive need for control?
you come into my house, Devette.
you lie to me?!
let's try to be rational.
did you really drive all the way up to Ojai just to crash Shawn's crowning moment?
get out.
Henry, we're here for you.
at least listen.
out now.
get out!
out!
I'd like to start.
when I was about seven, he -
God!
look, I'm telling you, my son Shawn did not have permission to go on that field trip.
well, he did turn in this permission slip.
signed by you.
signature's a forgery. It's a fake.
well, that's a little dramatic, don't you think, Mr. Spencer?
look, this formis a counterfeit. These are serious charges.
and my son needs to be punished.
Mr. Spencer, all three are permission slips also signed by you.
Yes.
Yup.
Yes.
Yes, those--those are my signatures.
well, you see, then?
I'd be hard-pressed to believe that a child of Shawn's age could be capableof such detailed forgery.
well, you don't know my son.
no offense, but you are the vice principalof a middle school, not a handwriting expert.
that testimony's not gonnahold up in court.
well, we're not talking court.
are we?
you know,'cause if we were, you should know that
I did take a handwriting personality course at the Learning Annexlast summer.
and I can tell by the way you, uh, turn your n humps that you have a very open and childlike kindnessabout you.
I could be off on that. You know, it--it wasa one-night seminar.
Okay--now, as a sergeant with the santa barbara police department, let me tell youwhat I know.
see the pen lifton the r there?
the bleed mark-- that shows hesitation, as if thinking, "Gee. How do I formthat next letter?"
now I don't know about you, but I don't have to think about how to sign my own damn name.
so you're wrong.
Really? I don't know, dad.
I think Mr. Petlic has a point.
they look pretty identical to me.
present day
Hey, check it out. There's Lassiter.
make a loop like a bunny's ear, wrap it around, careful as you steer...
that's a good boy, Lassie.
wait a minute. You're not lassie.
well, I don't knowwhat a lassie is, but I'm not it.
I'm special agent Lars Ewing with the ftd.
you're a special florist?
federal treasury department.
we have a department that dealsexclusively with treasures?
if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting in an interim chief vick's office.
that's where our meeting is!
this is very exciting.
I feel nervous.
is that what you're wearing?
this goes against every federal bone in my body, but who are you guys?
I'm not familiar with the federal bone.
is that connected tothe hip bone or the knee bone?
well, I can tell youwhat the knee bone is gonna connect withif you don't get out of my way.
I'm gonna guess. Not the funny bone?
Yeah.
this meetingis bigger than we thought. - Yeah.
get us some seatsclose to the desk, but not on the side.
I'll catch upin a second.
waiting for Godot?
Guffman.
waiting to exhale?
I'm not waitingto exhale.
I'm the head psychicin the department.
this is...sort of my joint.
they, um...hire psychics around here?
personally, I'm a little bit skeptical.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
I was just getting a very strong vibration. Did you...
did you just recently take up the guitar?
Oh, my god. Yes, just recently.
very impressive. How did you do that?
sometimes there's just this amazingly strong connection from the word go.
I'm getting something else.
this is gonna be a very, very good week for you, Lindsay Leikin.
really, I...didn't think
just...let it happen.
so let me officially welcome you to santa barbara.
we are all ready and willing to
don't let me interrupt. Please continue.
What'd I say about seats on the side?
Mr. Spencer, this is special agent Ewing from the treasury department in washington.
Yes, we sniffed one another in the hallway.
he is here becausethey have been tracking an aggressive forger who's been counterfeiting large numbers of $100 bills and then laundering the moneyinto small communities across the country.
the last being a home depot right here in the heartof your little hamlet.
well, we are raringto help you with this federal bust.
who is this?
this is Carlton Lassiter, our head detective, and his junior partner, Juliet O'Hara.
Ah, the name Juliet.
how silver-sweetsound lovers' tongues by night.
Shakespeare. Romeo and juliet.
tootie, you in trouble.
it's Mindy Cohn. Facts of life.
could you gentlemen please state your name once again?
and please speak clearly.
is that a recording device?
government issued?
asking if thatis a recording device is like asking if this is a pen.
is it a pen? - That's classified.
it's a pen.
it's tiny. Probably can't hold much.
Oh, that's not a tape recorder.
that is a high-techmicrophone system attached to a Mildred.
a Mildred? What's--what's a Mildred?
I believe it's an intelligence-gathering device.
"Mildred" is probably an anagram.
military intel listening device recorder...something.
mildred is not a device. She's my stenographer.
you haveyour own stenographer?
I am hyper-careful. Can't take any chances.
saved my behindmore than once in making cases stickpast deposition.
brilliant. Chief?
not happening.
now what I need from all of you is your full cooperation in assisting special agent Ewingin any way he sees fit.
now, any questions?
I have a questionfor special.
who is this? - I'm sorry.
this is Shawn Spencer. And his partner, Burton Guster.
Mr. Spencer is a psychic with the department who I thought might be helpful.
well, next time I have to go on a panty raid, I'll give him a call.
but we already have our own psychic.
she's just started in the department and she is already a superstar.
got us so closeto the counterfeiter a month agoin Wilmette, Illinois.
we must have missed himby only a few minutes.
Mr. Spencer, Lindsay- - Leikin.
we too metin the hallway.
okay, then. Let's adjourn this meeting.
uh, I know special agent Ewing has prepared informational packets for all of you.
we will meetat the home depot tomorrow.
let's say...0700 hours.
700 hoursis almost 20 days. Shouldn't we act sooner?
0700 is 7: 00 A. M.
precisely, detective.
striking and whip-smart. Intriguing.
I knew that too.
you have Pennsylvania ave. Running through your veins.
ever consider taking the bureau exam?
I have.
let me set up that conference area for you. Right this way.
little skeptical of psychics, are we?
I should have said"just you.
and don't thinkI didn't pick up on that calluses on my hands guitar clue.
good one.
this is gonna be good.
I'm gonna solve this case, and I'm gonna prove you're a fake.
fun, right?
okay, you are all instructed to cooperate fully with the federal agents.
I'll be damned if we're gonna get shown up on our own turf.
they may be the feds, but we are a team and this is our town.
they will need us.
you breached protocol, Leikin. I waited outside the hotel, 0630.
you weren't there.
Yeah, sorry. I got up early and went to go get coffee.
son, let me ask you a question.
what made you think those $100 bills were authentic?
Um,'cause they said "100" on them.
are you an idiot? Don't answer that.
if I plopped a granny smith apple down on this counter and carved a "100" on it, would you accept that as legal tender?
don't answer that.
do you know what microprinting is?
I'm confused. Should I answer that?
I know what it is.
the introduction of microprinting as an anti-replicant feature began in 1990 with the addition of the words "united states of america" printed around Ben Franklin's lapel.
in addition, the words "U. S.100" are printed within the lines of the lower left 100.
I'm sorry-- is it just me, or is this unbearably boring?
I don't know how ms. Leikin works, but gus and I are going to investigate the body of the store and search for our culprit's twisted, wretched, filthy aura.
because that is what serious psychics do.
Shawn. What are you doing?
dad.
wow, you look so tiny down there.
what the hell are you doing up there?
what does it look like I'm doing? We're making a case.
a federal one.
Oh, of course you are.
well, when you've finished wrapping things up for the pentagon, I want you at my house.
I got a project for you.
afraid we're gonna be a little busy having our pictures taken with the president of the united states of america.
mm, oh, I think you'll be there.
you owe me. - I owe you?
Yeah, for the last 12 times I helped you solve one of your little cases-- you agreed.
Gus, did I agree to that?
well, technically- - gus.
I think you did.
see ya.
excuse me. Can I help you guys?
Hello, Garrison.
we're working on the counterfeiting case.
and we need to see all ofyesterday's security footage.
how do you knowmy name's Garrison?
you thought thiswas gonna be a problem?
I'm sorry, man. I--I didn't meanto freak you out.
my name is Shawn Spencer.
I'm a psychicwith the police department.
there was already a psychichere last night.
from washington, no less.
she looked at all the tapes and there was no positive id.
she already came here, huh?
and she's good. She also knew my name was Garrison.
uh, you mind if I take a peek anyway?
I work a little differently than her. My process is a little more complex.
I can sometimes pick up images that are underneath the epidermal layer.
29
this is the tape of the counterfeiter that she looked at last night.
you know, honestly, if that pretty lady psychic couldn't pick up anything,
I can't imagine you're gonna have much luck.
you know what, you're probably right. We gave it a shot.
Thanks, Garrison.
tall? Short?
age? Race?
do you mean to tell me that the only thingyou can remember clearly is that he was a man?
and technically, I can't even be sure of that, now, can I?
wait. I'm getting something.
He...did not wearcorrective lenses.
actually, that is true.
okay, well, that's something to go on.
good work, Mr. Spencer.
great--and so we're looking for someone in santa barbara who does not wear glasses.
he-- he had a small scar about three inches, on the jaw line.
and he worea single stud diamond in his left ear.
Yes. And yes.
she's exactly right. I can see that clearly now.
that's why she's the best.
tough break.
dad, I'm confused. There are plans for a wet bar.
Yeah, that's right. For entertaining.
right, but I don't seeanywhere in the plans the portal into 1976.
Shawn, a wet bar happens to be a timeless home feature.
right, perfect for those warm summer evenings when reggie Jackson and Dyan Cannon swing by for harvey wall bangers.
Shawn. Are you gonna crack wiseor are you gonna get to work?
I feel likeit should be noted that neither Gus nor myself are licensed plumbers.
Yes, I understand that, Shawn.
I've already installedthe sink.
all you two have to do is connect the fittings.
all right. Let's get to work.
Seriously?
this will be good. - It will?
work is good, Gus. Work is glorious.
it's the breath of life.
what is this? - It's a drill.
of course it is. Don't be ridiculous.
you're still upset that Lindsay showed you up at the crime scene, aren't you?
what is her trick?
maybe she's just morepsychic-y than you.
Gus, don't be ridiculous. There's no such thingas psychics.
I don't know, Shawn.
even I've been getting a little bitof intuition lately.
in fact, I'm getting something right now.
something very strong.
She's--she's-- better than you.
you know, they say imitationis the greatest form of flattery, but that hurts.
it hurts below the belt.
Shawn, if you want to beat her, then we have to actually work the case.
utilize my knowledge.
you know I havea coin collection.
I've studied tenderfrom around the world.
I have over 85 buffalo nickels, Shawn. - Okay.
first of all, and this is key, don't ever, under any circumstances, ever admit that to anyoneoutside of these walls.
secondly, I love utilizingyour knowledge, Gus.
I can't wait until we havethe case of the missing thimble.
but this case is not about counter feiting.
it's about me versus her. Ecks versus Sever.
Joe versus the Volcano.
fine. Then let's get to it.
what do you know?
all right, this is what I got.
he managed not to be identified on any of the security cameras, which means he's smart.
smart enough to stay ahead of the game.
which means changing up anything that could be linked or traced to him.
like his vehicle. - His key.
it was distinctively nissan. Probably a murano.
maybe a Sentra.
so we go back and check the outdoor surveillance cameras from the store, and look for nissans in the parking lot yesterday.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I already tipped Lassiter off to that.
the only one that didn't check out was a new one with no plates.
Ewing's informational packet links this guy to over a dozen vehicles since he left Washington.
his pattern's to spend six to eight days in a town before pricking up ears.
you read Ewing's informational packet?
cover to cover.
that's weird. I just read the cover.
but I don't need to read the whole thing to know that that's his M. O.
he's too smart to still bedriving that car, Gus.
he's gotta be switching out his mode of transportation on a daily basis.
and paying cash.
gotta launder as much of that funny money as he can.
so the question is, to which car dealership would a crook goto spend lots of cash without pricking up ears?
this must bewhat Jay Leno feels like when he walks into his garage.
which makes you kevin eubanks.
I don't think they roll around town together, Shawn.
can we talkto the owner? - First we play customer.
it's the people who groove on the floor that are gonna give us the scoop, Gus.
excuse me, my buddy here is interested in the banana yellow ferrari, though he's neither gay nor European.
I hope that's not a prob
look who finally figured it out. Little late.
how did you not notice her, Shawn?
I wasn't expecting herto be here. - You were looking right at her.
she's got me all out of whack. - Get your head in the game.
so what's going on? No one calls us anymore.
that's the new thing? I thought we were a team.
Yeah, first of all, the whole "team" thing. She wasn't talking to you.
and secondly, Ewing didn't call me.
he called O'hara.
it's not likeI asked him to.
it's okay, Clarice. You don't have to make excuses to us.
it wasn't just today.
my phone's been ringing all the time.
I don't know how he got my home number.
I mean, please. Do you think I wanted to pick up my phone at 2: 00 A. M.
and hear his voice all gravelly and masculine?
probably called from the hotel.
maybe just got out of the shower or finished with a swim.
dripping wet.
just catch Mr. Spencer and Mr. Guster upon what Ms. Leikin was able to figure out.
apparently our guy came in here, bought a used lamborghini for $47, 000 in cash.
next day, he tries to return it.
all sales are final, but the sales manager makes a concession, offering a mere $26, 000 in cash.
he accepts it?
what kind of idiotis this guy?
a genius idiot, according to the feds.
you see, those familiar with this sort of thing know that it's the classic grift.
essentially, he traded 47 gs of worthless paper for $26, 000 in cold, hard cash.
I've seen it before.
where, in a mamet play? Any witnesses?
no, but a lamborghini was spotted outside of town in goleta, but it was moving too fast to make an id.
you know, I don't thinkhe's a swimmer.
he's not really that build. I bet he plays rugby.
Hey, what color is that suit?
black. - Really?
it seems blacker than black.
it's washington black.
look, if anyone wants to join me,
I'm gonna be taking a look at some of the billsfrom the safe that didn't get deposited.
look, Leikin, I think it's possible that we got offon the wrong foot.
is that right? - Yeah, I mean, this is silly.
we should join forceslike pitt and jolie, you know?
work together, make it nice for everyone.
I don't think you get it.
I have nothing to gain here. If you haven't noticed, my job is safe.
it's you I'm worried about, faker.
in that case, maybe we should just date. - I'm seeing somebody.
well, is it- - serious? Yes.
you didn't know I was gonna- - Yes, I did.
dude, don't you know the move where you take off your jacket and you lay it across some seats?
get your headin the game, Shawn.
uh, budgies?
these are good.
but they're not great.
you see how on this bill, the edge of the nose on Ben Franklin's cloudy?
did you get that, Mildred?
Hey, is there any reason a $100 bill would change colors?
actually, yes. It's an effect caused by color-shifting ink.
it's only present in $100 bills.
the changing coloris called color diffraction.
and it's made possible when light reflects off of metallic flakesadded to the ink.
good work, gus. - Thank you.
so we'll check the information that Ms. Leikin's gathered for us thank goodness! Finally, some nice seats, huh?
this is what I'm talking about.
what? Did I did I just sit in something?
Gus, do I have puddingon my jeans? - No, no.
nothing? - Shawn.
I think we're not welcomed here.
Gus, don't bea paranoid schizophrenic. We're always welcome here.
no, look.
Oh, my god we're not welcome.
it's nothing personal, Mr. Spencer.
special agent Ewing just feels that Ms. Leiken has things covered on the psychic front.
and I have to agree with him.
okay. Take a hint.
certainly don't need to be told twice.
I think you were just told three times.
you know what, this is fine, because we had a good run.
thank you for the memories.
Oh, just one more thing.
you might want to checkthe cash from the dealership, because it's not all counterfeit.
that's ridiculous.
if I had learned how to laugh as a child, I would right now.
I lookedat all those bills myself.
do you really want to go against the leading special agentin counterfeiting with 14 years of experience under his belt and say that those bills weren't fake?
not all of them. Just one.
and I believe the serial number was...
where are we going?
shouldn't we have stayed until they checked the bills out?
wait for it.
wait for it.
Spencer. Hold up.
the bill checked out. It's real.
all right. Answer me this, Mr. Psychic.
why would a counterfeiterever use real bills?
because he had to.
Man...I read your informational packet cover to cover.
our guy spends six to eight days in every city
we're only on day four. Quite simply, he ran out of dough.
he didn't know what kind of deal he'd be able to make on the car.
turns out, short one bill.
lucky for us.
so what's our next move?
well, I'll call washington and begin
I'm sorry, I was asking Mr. Spencer.
Oh--oh, you want to know what I think his next move is.
Oh, Gus, look, she wants-- well, let's see here.
he's gotta print more money. My guess is he, uh, set up shop here in town.
so...we find his little nest, we find him.
well, buddy...I really hope you like this.
it took me 19 hours to bake.
put it in last night before bed.
it takes 19 hours to bakea pineapple upside-down cake?
it does when it's being heated by a 60-watt bulb.
it's not upside down, Shawn.
who could that beat this hour?
are you gonna invite me in?
guess.
so this is what a psychic detective officelooks like.
you know, I always imagined it-- does something smell like pineapple?
pineapple upside-down cake.
would you like some? Wait.
before you answer that, are you a fan of delicious flavor?
all right, look.
this isn't easy for me to say, but...
I was wrong.
you're better than I thought.
your discovery at the station today was a huge get.
I think we should work together after all.
the faster we find out where the counterfeiter's den is, the better.
that is, if you guys are willing.
I don't know.
depends. Don't you think, Gus?
wait.
I'm definitely getting something.
Oh, this is good.
it's a--it's a-- it's a transient location.
where people can come and go anonymously, paying in cash.
and--and it's remote, so they can print large sums of money on a noisyprinter without being heard.
Yes--yes, I'm getting that same thing. - Yes?
and I see it. - Yes?
it's by a body of water.
Really?
it's by a body of water?
Leikin, that's amateur stuff.
you know what, I might expect that from John Edwards.
definitely from Miss CLeo. But not from you.
Leikin-- wait.
I'm also...
I'm also getting something in french.
a sign, maybe?
could it be a european hotel? - Wait a minute.
she may be on to something. I know this particular hotel.
it's on my sales route. On a private beach
whoa, whoa, whoa. - What?
it's just--it's strange. I'm--I'm pretty familiar with your route, Gus.
I don't recall any private beaches with hotels on them.
what are you talking about, Shawn?
where was ityou went last summer for the Pips autograph signing convention?
you met Gladys Knight? - No.
just the pips. - Actually, a pip.
the other two got stuck in traffic. Look, I don't wanna talk about it.
the point is, it's beenunder construction for months.
which would account for the noise.
and it caters to europeans.
this could be the place.
sweet. We totally scored.
but you couldn't have got that without my transient location thing, am I right?
I don't...I don't think that cake is cooked.
I need to know every guest... - cashed in the last week.
I'm sorry, who are you, and what do you want?
special agentLars Ewing. Federal treasury department.
head detectiveCarlton Lassiter, santa barbara police department.
presidential recommendation for distinguished service.
presidential physical fitness award.
eighth, ninth, and tenth grade. And I've got a cocktail napkin from air force one.
I personally arrested Ivan Boesky.
I wrestled in high school.
what, with your conscience? - That is it!
look, we need to know who's paid with cash or travelers checks recently.
my god, you're a firecracker.
it would probably be easier to ask who didn't.
I'm sorry?
this is a hotel. We're a cash business. Lots of european travelers.
south tower mezzanine to walkway
with what foreign credit card companies charge these days, cash is king.
the south tower, I see him.
I see him in the south tower.
how many rooms in the south tower? - There are 170.
let's start banging on some doors and call for backup.
if we tap every available source of man power, we can have this thing done18, 19 hours tops.
I can alert washing tonright now and have an 80-man swat teamon a c-130 hercules.
they could be herein less than three hours.
filthy sheets!
I see dirty, filthy sheets.
Yes, and towelson the floor.
and a mediocre, half-eaten turkey club sandwich.
and he's refusedmaid service.
okay, what guest refused maid service?
I might remind you we do cater to a very european crowd.
he's isolated.
he's in a less-desirable room that's not facing the ocean.
do you have any rooms that face the parking lot?
a few.
he's in one of those.
let's see.
french woman.
another french party.
here--here's a single gentleman. Paid all in cash.
corner room facing the alley.
and according to this, he's never taken his "do not disturb" sign off his door.
room number. - Key!
clear!
nice job, psychics, let's get to work.
that's a really cutefront-loader.
thank you.
he prints the money, then he washes it here to soften it.
then he tumbles it dryand beats it up with stones to give it that natural, worn texture.
linen paper
dude, there's linen fibers in that paper.
what was he doing, amending the constitution?
you can't print money on regular paper, Shawn.
that's government-issue.
I'm getting a visual.
he printed a batch of about 50, 000, which will last him a while.
five bills a sheet, at least 80 sheets missing from this ream-- that sounds about right.
wait.
no, I'm getting more.
I'm getting a lot more.
like 500, 000, which would last more than just a while.
maybe--maybe a whole lifetime.
that's not possible.
it is if you livein one of the baltic states.
I'm just not gettingthat feeling at all.
anything over 50, 000is just getting blocked from my receptors.
not a chance.
receptors? Really?
this would do it.
this is a 500-sheet ream, and it's likely he used it all.
treasury seal?
no.
passport seal.
this guy's officially on the lam.
we don't catch him now, we can kiss him good-bye.
the railway stations, obviously the airport securityhas been notified, and all the interstate agencies are on alert.
they've all been giventhe sketch based on Ms. Leikin'sdescription of the suspect.
okay, but pleasekeep your phones on just in case we getany movement.
what's the point?
nobody ever bothers to call us anymore.
Shawn, I don't do this much, but I just wanted to say thank you.
I know we haven't nailed him yet, but you were right, we make a good team.
Yes, we do.
and hopefully tomorrow we'll wrap this thing up.
have a good night.
wait for it...
wait for it.
Shawn, I was thinking maybe we could go somewhere now.
maybe continue working to see if we can't stumble upon some collective apparition.
that's a fantastic idea. I love it.
where could we go at this hour that's still open?
you know what, I think there's a color me mine that stays open late.
you don't quit with the jokes, do you?
I'm sorry, would you like me to stop? - Not yet. I kinda like it.
but actually, I was thinking back to my hotel room?
you know, it's something we could try.
I mean, it's not as much fun as making ashtrays with our names on them. But yeah.
I'm a flexible guy, a sportsman.
good.
all right, I'll head back to freshen up.
what do you say we meet at 2200 hours? - Perfect.
Oh, I'm so rude.
Gus, buddy, would you like to join us?
well, I-- - that sucks, so 2200 on the dot.
I'll be there.
dude, what time is 2200 hours?
buddy, help me out.
what is it? Is it, like, 11: 00 times two?
buddy!
so, tell me, Shawn.
are you planning on doing psychic police work forever?
no.
no, just until I findthe girl of my dreams.
and then I'll whisk her off to carmel and open a small haberdashery...
do some macrame, maybe.
maybe blow some glass.
well, as hotas that sounds, I think the psychic world would miss your talents.
just make sure they appreciate you.
after a while, the world tends to take people with our abilities for granted.
well, that's awfully easy for you to say.
I mean, you've already met your special someone
your handsome prince.
you're serious with somebody, remember?
actually, I recently had a change of heart.
Really?
would a certain psychic have anything to do with that?
well, we do have quite a connection.
we do. It's
it's like our minds are just fused together, you know?
I feel like holly hunter in broadcast news.
you know, when she's inside William hurt's head?
okay, let's try it.
I'm thinking of something.
None--they don't bury the survivors. - Yes, exactly.
you have a favorite color, and I'm seeing sea foam green.
actually, it's blue, but that is so nearthe green family.
pick a number between one and ten.
that's close enough.
you totally wanted me to do that.
you totally read my mind.
whoa, slow down. What do you mean she took off--when?
you know, I don't know when. She tricked me, okay?
she clearly wants to take all the credit for herself.
look, just--just meet me over here.
Oh, that's Lassieon the other line. I gotta take it.
you're dropping me for Lassiter?
hurry up!
you wait till now to call us?
I called you as soon as I heard.
do you think I want junior g-man here to beat me to the punch?
thank you.
well, it's affirmative--our counterfeiter.
shot with his own gun-- there are signs of a struggle.
checks out Assteven J. Grabinski.
his only priors area couple counts of petty theft, and small-time fraud in washington.
he had a small scar, about three incheson the jaw line.
he wore a single stud diamond in his left ear.
damn, she's good.
I don't know howyou do it in washington, but here, we don't disturb the body till forensics has a chance to come in, collect some evidence.
Lassiter, ease up.
we're lucky if our psychic doesn't lick the body.
well...
I guess congratulations are in order.
we have to hand it to our federal agents here.
though we would have preferred to bring him in and charge him, this case looks pretty much wrapped up.
there's no need to congratulate us for doing what is our job.
we don't ask for commendation for what is merely our proud honor of servitude to our country.
perhaps just a small hug.
just an itty-bitty one.
I'm serious.
too much?
so how'd you sleep?
well, I guess I was rightabout one thing.
it turned out to bea pretty good week for you.
look, I'm sorry, Shawn.
I don't know whatyou want me to say to you.
I don't know either.
you lost a case. You lose.
she's on the winning side, you're on the losing side.
she's the winner, you're the loser.
you know, dad, had I made a list of things I did want to hear, that wouldn't even have made the top eight.
something is really off with this cake.
but, Shawn, you want my advice, I think you should quit.
what?
you should quit. That's what you do.
when things get tough, somebody's better than you, you quit.
where is this even coming from?
Oh, come on, Shawn, I've got 80 examples sitting on the tip of my tongue.
eighth grade you quit the bassoon when Bobby Nowocinski beat you out for the soloin the winter festival.
let me get this straight.
you have an example from eighth grade sitting on the tip of your tongue?
Shawn, the point is, a year from now you won't even be working for the santa barbarapolice department.
you don't know that.
all right, look, Shawn, now I'm gonna tell you something that you do want to hear.
I accept you for who you are.
is that a fact? - That is a fact.
you don't have to prove anything to me.
I'm gonna let you off the hook.
now, how's that feel, better?
now you can go ahead, and you can quit this too.
first of all-- and I think I can say this now with a fair amount of certainty there's definitely somethingnot right about this cake.
maybe because it was bakedwith a child's oven.
we're talking about a deluxe easy-bake oven, Gus.
I paid over $300 for iton ebay. This is hardly a toy.
okay, I didn't major in psychology, but I'm gonna guess this doesn't have anything to do with the cake.
I'm sorry.
it's got nothing to do with you or me or my dad or the cake.
it's got a little something to do with the cake.
but it's mostly about Lindsay showing us upon this case.
she's either a crazy-good psychic, or she's just a better detective than me.
Hey, I thought you had her back at the hotel when you surprised her with that $500, 000 thing.
I'm getting more-- I'm getting a lot more.
like 500, 000, which would last more than just a while.
maybe a whole lifetime.
that's not possible.
I did have her.
I totally had her. Come on!
Mildred, you kept a record of everything that was said in this investigation.
am I right?
if someone as little as burped, I got it down.
there's a symbol for burp?
terrific. I need you to clarify something for me.
two days ago, in the morning, outside the home depot center.
Ewing and Leikin making small talk.
can you read that back?
what was that, 0700 hours?
no, no, it was 7: 00 A. M.
here's something.
ewing: "Do you know ofa good chocolatier?
Leikin: "I had someonein seattle, specialized in hazelnutpraline stuff--very good.
it was just after that.
something about the dye used in public swimming pools to identify urine?
no.
the musical wicked? - No.
something about coffee? - Yes, that's it.
Mildred, could you readthe coffee thing?
ewing: "You breached protocol, Leikin.
I waited for you outside the hotel, 0630, but you weren't there.
Yeah, sorry, I got up early and went to grab coffee.
Mildred, where are Ewing and Leikin now?
where I'm supposed to be-- catching a chartered flight back to washington.
I'm late. - Not a problem. We'll give you a ride.
we happen to be headed that way. - Oh, that's great.
Mildred, here, say this.
shotgun. - Tough luck, buddy.
well, folks, you all did a nice job on this investigation.
so, uh...
you have a my space page or something?
whoa, Lindsay, Lindsay, Lindsay! Wait, wait, wait!
I just wanted to make sure I had an opportunity to congratulate you, you know, personally.
well, thank you.It's not necessary.
no, no, no, it is necessary. You did it.
you cracked it. I mean, you deserve all the credit--you're amazing.
she's an amazing person.
look, Shawn, don't feel too bad.
there'll beother cases.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I know.
but not for you.
you see...
it all started when you identified the scar on the jaw line of our counterfeiter, along with his little diamond-stud earring.
I mean, I couldn't even draw a hair color.
so there's no way that you could do that unless
unless you'd already seen him before.
this is ridiculous. - Is it?
it's not like I'm wearing a giant moose costume.
I had a vision you were drinking coffee.
Oh, congratulations.
but not at the hotel.
you were driving past one starbucks, two starbucks, 17 starbucks, and ended upall the way in goleta.
on the very same day that Grabinski's lamborghini was spotted just outside of town in--anybody?
special?
that's right. Goleta.
the two of you were partners and you were in touch the whole time.
what's more, they were lovers in the night.
I'm seeing somebody.
I didn't think it was possible to fall in love with somebody in the span of five minutes.
she got us so close to the counterfeiter a month agoin Wilmette, Illinois.
probably just missed him by five minutes.
that's when you met him.
you didn't miss him.
she had him.She had your bad boy red-handed.
suddenly you were much more interested in combining forces and making a whole lot of money.
and it was going well.
it was going very well...
until you blew it.
you know which moment I'm talking about, right?
the one in the hotel room.
when you realized he had printed way more than the 50,000 that you'd planned.
and the passport?
so you called him that morning, you met him at the warehouse.
it was you who struggled with him.
and it was you who shot him dead.
only then, having your vision that miraculously led everyone here to the crime scene.
Oh, come on.
I mean, I've seen poor losers before, but this is just sad.
your dna was all over him.
or comb it.
braid it.
maybe put it in pigtails. - Shawn!
that only leaves one outstanding issue.
and that is-- where's the rest of the money?
wait a minute.
what's happening?
what's happening to me?
I've heard about this.
it's called spontaneous psychic krav maga.
Oh, my, it's the bag.
something's in the bag!
it's bad. It's very bad.
and it could be embarrassing.
well, you were wrong about one thing, Shawn.
I didn't sleep with you because you were my enemy.
I did it because I really thought we had something.
okay.
first of all, a little discretion would be nice.All right?
I mean, these are -- these are my co-workers.
secondly, anything we may have had, you ruined.
because you betrayed your gift, Leikin.
you give a bad name to psychics like me who pride themselves on the purity of that gift.
there are so many people out there who already doubt what we do.
now you've given 'em all a reason to think that we're fakes.
you sicken me.
I'm sickened.
I mean, sure, I'm still wildly attracted to you on the physical level, but spiritually and psychically, you're dead to me.
gun! I'm taking him and I'm taking the plane.
this is not what it looks like.
OK Washington
be possible
Yeah, well you see, that's the thing, Shawn.
sure, your bike looks great with all these ridiculous reflectors and gadgets from years' worth of cereal box tops, but gus here focused on what's important:
hard work.
I'm sorry son, but he just out-pedaled you.
but he just out-pedaled you.
do you understand?
I think so.
I got it!
I had the wrong song playing that time.
best two out of three.
I know... what you're trying to do, Shawn. And it's not gonna work.
I'm not buying.
Oh, it's on now.
on three.
one...
two...
let go of my chair, Shawn.
the wheels! They're stuck together!
listen, you two... - did you see who won? I beat him, didn't I?
no, no, no. Two out of three. - Ha, that means I beat him, right?
unlike everyone else around here, I'm not fooled by the fact that you...
wear grown-up clothes have mastered the rudimentary levels of communication and, somehow, manage to feed yourselves.
I see you for what you are: Children.
so do me a favor and let the grown-ups do their work.
I got a boo-boo.
speaking of boo-boos, you wouldn't happen to haveany extra unsolved cases lying around, would you?
you wouldn't happen to have any extra unsolved cases lying around, would you?
Spencer, there is just no easy way to tell you that I consider youa waste of this department's time and energy.
huh.
I guess there was an easy way.
but actually I've got less patience for you today than normal.
see, I received an invitation to give a presentation at 21-les.
21st century law enforcement seminar?
Oh. - Oh. yes.
we know that better as"21 saint cent-les."
I like to call it21 cent law info semin.
go ahead...
make jokes.
but we just did.
you see, kids, I will be presenting the cutting edge technology.
modern tools for the new detective.
we're talking back-scatterx-ray scanning, dna sampling, sonic weaponry, you name it, I am
that's weird.
I could have sworn that I
I don't believe it. - Don't believe what?
my car, it's gone. It was right there. It's...
it's been stolen.
who would dare steal my car?
well, here's the good news.
it'll make for an amusing anecdote during your presentationat 21 saint cent-les.
morning, O'conell.
just rapping with the fellas, shooting the breeze.
sweet, now they'll just think it's 1974.
wait a minute.
is--is this a prank?
did you take my car? Is this some sort of "punking"?
to think that we would stoop so low as to tamper with police-issued property, and defile the institution that is the santa barbara police department, is an affront to our honor.
I for one, am greatly offended. And I, for two.
I just don't see how this could have happened.
did you?
wait! I'm getting something. - What, Shawn? What is it?
it's a trace on Lassie's car.
it's faint, but clear.
you were recently somewhere where the security of your car was compromised.
I'm sensing someplace posh.
surprisingly upscale for someone on half a civil servant's salary.
as it happens, I... dined at a very exclusive restaurant last night.
the type of restaurant one would take a date to?
is old Lassie back in the game?
it is non of your business with whom I spend my personal time.
now you have to dish. She blonde? - Brunette?
mail order? - You sly dog.
please, I'm not gonna engage in some sort of juvenile masculinity contest.
he went by himself. - Yeah.
her name was Polly Smith. 324 sycamore lane.
we kissed. Ask her.
Whoa!
something happened at that restaurant that led to your car being stolen.
I'm sensing red coats.
and accents.
the British? - No.
the valets.
check the valet departure car.
he may have used the old "key in the putty" trick to get an impression.
of course, that would have beenmy first deduction, had I not been...
overcoming this blatant violation.
I'm gonna get right over there. - No, oh.
no car, remember?
you guys are so funny.
Oh, guess what. I just got a new car.
yours.
maybe we had a little too much fun with him.
maybe.
I have to pee-pee.
may I help you, gentleman?
the theft of police property has occurred. I have reason to believethe guilty party works here.
Oh, dear.
well, rest assured you have our complete cooperation.
I only ask that you keep your investigation under wraps.
you know, for appearance sake.
noted.
now, I'm gonna need to sequester your main dinning room, interview your entire valet staff, and possibly your busboys.
one moment.
Yeah, he's gonna be a problem. - I don't know. He seemed pretty cooperative.
your work here is done. I'll get my car back soon enough.
here.
but I'm warning you, if word of this little incidentgets out of the station,
I will start making things very difficult for you down there.
you're saying you haven't even been trying?
all this time?
good-bye.
he's not gonna get anywhere talking to those valets.
they hav ea very strict code. I still think you'rethinking about the British.
may have to roll my sleeves up for this one, Gus.
actually, I may have to take off my entire shirt.
please don't.
later.
hi there.
my name is Shawn Spencer.
I'm the head psychic for the Santa Barbara police department.
and I may need to get a statement from you.
more specifically, the word "yes."
nice try. But I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.
that's all right. If my parents were visiting,
I probably wouldn't wanna waste time meeting handsome new strangers either.
regardless of how smart or interesting they might be.
my parents are visiting.
that was pretty impressive. You really are psychic.
sorry, I thought you were just hitting on me.
Oh, I'm actually much more interested in going out with your parents.
I love them iniatures museum.
what was it you needed to ask me about?
do you recall any uh...
suspicious behavior from any of the valetson duty last night?
now that you mention it, we had a new guy who started yesterday, but didn't show up this morning.
bingo.
gonna need a nameand a phone number.
of course.
and then...
I'll give you the information about the valet.
get this.
the valet's numberis actually a number to a pay phone outside of a warehouse.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know if itlooks like the warehouse from blue city, Gus.
you're the only one that remembers that movie.
what, are you insane?
way more people saw from the hip than blue city
look, I'm not gonna talk Judd Nelson right now.
no, just-- just meet me at the stationin an hour.
thank you.
a warehouse?
sweet! There's always something happening on the inside a warehouse.
you staked it out, right? I know you staked it out.
Oh, it got staked.
Stook.
Staken?
Staked, right? - Right.
Yeah, yeah--it got staked.
you found out what happened to Lassiter's car? - A whole bunch of cars go in, but only boxes fullNof car parts come out.
dude, it's a chop shop.
that's big.
victims-- I see victims everywhere!
it's horrible!
sawed-off parts strewn about.
fluids sprayingin every direction. - Oh, dear god!
are we talking abouta serial killer? - I can see the victims' names.
accord, look out! - get outta there!
Escalade, don't let him in the door.
Oh, Camry, you were too young to go!
are we talking about cars? - Stolen cars?
the signal's too strong.
I'm getting "chopsticks." "Chopped salad?"
what?
chop suey? - Good god!
wheelie and the chopper bunch.
does that mean anything to you? "Wheelie and the chopper bunch.
chop shop! It's a chop shop.
Yes!
and--and I see a warehouse.
and cargo containers.
and a street sign. And a little mousenamed algernon in a maze.
flower street!
flower street-- that's down by the tracks.
we better check this out.
you know you just bought that, right?
looks like a slam dunk, Mr. Spencer.
Wally thereis the ringleader. And all the evidence we need to take him down is right here.
I mean, stolen parts, serial numbers, shipment logs-- you name it.
no need to thank me, chief. Just glad to help.
don't thank him either.
well, if I can't thank you I can't pay you.
our pleasure. - Oh, you're very welcome. You are.
you know, this ring was responsible for hundreds of car thefts around town.
