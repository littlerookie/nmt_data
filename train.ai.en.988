he's smiling like he's got something on me.
I dunno what it is. - Please, you know him.
I do know how him. - You know how he is. So who cares?
I care! - Why do you need to know?
I just would like to... - OK.
it doesn't bother me. I just wanna know.
just listen. I was very sad. I was very lonely.
and you, more than anyone, know... - OK. That's it. That's enough.
how I get after I have a couple of drinks.
I don't want to know the details. - I get...
please. I'm not one of your girlfriends.
don't tell me. Stop talking. - He was my first.
OK, the kid's here. - It came out like a natural, organic thing.
I don't want to know about this. - We didn't...
we didn't go through with it.
sat there and we realised we're just good friends.
I think there's something dead in there.
Uhh. OK, go and look for it. Maybe it's a rat.
let's go look for the rat. - I have to work, and I'll be back.
no, wait, wait, wait. - You're going? No, no, no.
you can't leave.
you said you were going to help me, OK?
go work with your dad. It's fun.
I'll be back later. 'Bye.
alright. Take that bucket, fill it.
see the hose? - Mm-hm.
trash, trash, trash.
save that, save that.
save the metal ones.
Ugh!
tip it over.
alright, buddy.
I got some presents for you.
watch this.
steel wool, right?
Mm-hm. - Scrub brush. Right?
I want you to do that on the whole truck.
Hey, buddy, you don't have to clean that. We're throwing it out.
alright? Clean something else.
alright, that looks good. Clean out the lowboy now.
the what? - The low...
the reach-in fridge, right here. Clean this out.
Ohh! That's it.
that's where the smell's coming from. What is that?
I don't know. Whatever it is, clean it out.
Ohh... - What the hell are you doing?
you told me to clean it out. - Not throw it in the garbage.
that's a perfectly good hotel pan. Scrub it out.
no, that's gross! I'm not cleaning that out.
pick it out of the garbage. - Are you kidding?
it's disgusting. - You don't throw it in the garbage.
like we saved the rest of the stuff. Let's just clean it out.
no.
pick it out of the trash. - No.
pick it out of the trash can.
you wanted to work in a kitchen.
this is what working in a kitchen is, OK?
we don't throw shit out. - Yeah, I wanted to come and cook.
not clean it! - Pick it out of the garbage!
No! I cleaned your whole stupid truck!
why are you so mean to me!
Hey, I can't get a hold of your mom.
but you... The truck looks great.
you did a great job. I'm sorry I was mean.
that wasn't right of me.
I gotta pick up some equipment for the truck.
you wanna come with me and help me pick out a stove till Mom calls back?
fine.
alright. Let's go.
you know what this is?
french fries? - That's right, a fryer.
this is the one we need right here. Come on, let's go.
double convection oven underneath. It's a real workhorse.
60 inches. I think we could fit them on the truck. What do you think?
let's get it. - Let's get this one. Good. Done.
this is the... Ah, here's what we need.
this is the thing I was looking for. Right there.
it's called a plancha. We make Cuban sandwiches on that.
this is the key to our entire livelihood. We need two of these.
looks good. You know what?
let's also get the 6-inch chef's knife with the plastic handle.
then you need also the holder. - Yeah, let's get a cover as well.
OK, you see this, Percy?
that's a chef's knife.
a real chef's knife.
it's not a toy. You understand?
this thing's sharp. It can send you to the hospital if you're not careful.
I'll teach you how to use this thing.
but a chef's knife, it belongs to the chef, not to the kitchen.
so it's your responsibility to keep it sharp, clean, not to lose it.
can you handle that? - Yes.
this is a good knife.
it'll last you a long time if you take care of it.
don't lose it.
I won't. Thank you.
you earned it.
how are we gonna get it in the truck?
well, Marvin said we could use some of his guys to help out.
Hey, guys! Hello?
I'm Carl. This is my truck.
I need some help moving this equipment in.
Marvin said that you guys might help me.
I got it. Mind if I borrow this?
get to the top floor.
maybe a little higher?
the hard part was getting it over to the truck, and now we just have to tip.
if I can get one end up on the tailgate.
OK.
Oh, hey, hey. Don't do that. You're gonna rupture something, man.
Hey! - Martin!
Hey, killer, what's up? How you doing, little gangster, huh?
what the hell you doing here? - I warned you, man. I warned you.
if you got another gig, I was gonna drop everything to be your line cook. Didn't I?
this is a food truck. You're a sous-chef now.
so? Food trucks don't need a sous-chef?
OK, fine. You're hired. Pays nothing.
I'll take it. - Nice!
you're not gonna scare me, buddy. - Thank you so much.
you must've jumped on a plane as soon as we got off the phone.
dude, when I heard your voice, I was like, "That's what I wanna do.
I'm so happy you're here. - Me too, man.
we're trying to get this in the truck. - Yeah?
I need some sort of, like, lever and fulcrum.
come on, everybody. Everybody together. Come on.
holy sh... No, we can't do this.
no way, not without one of us hurting ourselves. No, no, no, don't.
stop. Stop. I got it, I got it.
Carl, easy.
it's good to know Spanish. - You gotta, man.
thank you. Thank you, guys.
Ah! - OK, good.
nice. - Fryer next?
no, no, forget the freaking fryer, man.
I'm gonna fill up the propane tanks, you go to the market... get cerveza, not beer.
I can't go to the market. We gotta hook up the fryer. Get rid of the steam pit.
no, by the time you get back, I'll have this all spotless and cleaned up.
I got lots of marinating to do.
I promised these people the best sandwich of their lives.
OK. Good. So... - Get me the mojo.
OK, so, what do you need? Oranges, onion, garlic.
that's right. Why don't we juice it up a little bit, huh?
Tomatillo. - Some chillies, yeah. Cilantro.
now get the hell outta here. - Let's go.
OK, look, the key is, you gotta look for ingredients and then that gives you ideas of what to cook.
like, this is yucca, right?
get some of that. Those look great. See that?
and... Oh, come here.
you know what this is?
uh, bananas?
that's called a plantain. Plátanos.
these are maduros. Feel, soft?
Mm-hm. - That's the sweet kind.
but we want the green ones. Here. Hang onto this.
this is what you make tostones with.
that's Martin's favourite.
I got it. I got it. - You got it? Too much?
I got it. - OK.
watch out for tarantulas. Come on. - What?
Ahh! That's good.
Oh, look at that.
Oh, yeah. My masterpiece, baby.
that's beautiful. - Miami, I am back. Pow!
you could have just bought this at the store. I think they sold it there.
you sure that's your son, man? - I don't know.
you'd better get a paternity test.
Oh, that looks incred... - Can I have some?
Oh, Martin.
please, just gimme some. - It's not from the store.
you might not like it. - It's fatty but not heavy, you know?
you don't want any of this. - Yes, I do.
you're probably vegan. You can't eat it. - I'm not vegan.
it's not from the store. - Oh, my God.
Martin, come on. Can I have some? - Hold on a second.
can I give him a piece, Martin? - Nah, man, he's not...
alright. Let me think about it. - Just a little piece. Let's see.
pretty good. - Pretty good?
pretty good? Come on! - Better than the store?
one more. Just one more.
the best shit you ever had in your life. Come on, man.
Oh, give me another one. If you're gonna give him some, give me some.
don't be cheap. - I want more.
you know what? Let's make some sandwiches.
Yes, sir. Let's get to it. - Alright. Ready to go?
Hey, little man, is the plancha red-hot?
huh? - Me?
no, I'm talking to the grill. Yeah, you.
do I touch it? - Well, what do you think?
no. - That's right. No, genius.
Hey, look. Come over here, look.
see this water? - Mm-hm.
bang. Is it hot? - Yes.
tell him it's hot. - It's hot.
OK. - Is it hot as your daddy's underwear?
good. Now, watch. Come over here.
here we go, papi. Perfect. Perfecto.
now, watch me. Watch what I'm doing.
two slices of ham, three of pork.
now come over here. - Now the maestro.
two slices of cheese... one, two.
two pickles. - Can I do pickles?
big pickles. Nice. One, two.
now, watch this. Take this... mustard, from end to end.
OK.
you go side to side, not forward and back.
now, this is the most important part.
this is what makes it a Cubano. - OK.
take the butter. See that? - Yeah.
on top. Take a little bit.
butter the grill.
in. Just like that.
now, watch.
I want you to watch for the bread to get golden.
I want you to watch for the cheese to melt.
when that cheese is melted and that bread's golden, but not burnt, you call me, you tell me it's done and we'll check, OK?
OK. - Keep an eye on it.
I want you to watch everything everybody's doing, because when we're hopping, you're gonna have to jump in on the line and help out.
I think it's done. - You think it's done?
Oh, look at that. - See how golden that is?
that's how you want it every time. - Nice job.
you gotta be like a robot when you're on a line.
you're the shit, baby. You're the shit.
OK?
Mmm! Three equal pieces.
let's see what we got. - Alright, here we go.
Oh, hot. - Ah. Let me see.
look at that cheese.
Oh, my God, man. - This is the shit.
this is it. - Oh!
this is it. - This is it.
it's incredible. - This is empingao.
Oh, empingao! - Empingao, man.
then I guess we're open.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We're open?
I didn't get to finish my sandwich.
here you go. - What do I do?
cut the bread.
there's cerveza down there.
little man, get me hazelnuts, get me some more ham.
OK.
alright, I got four right here.
Hey, jefe, this sound system sounds like ass.
but my cousin knows a guy who'll hook us up with all our musical necessities.
my credit cards are maxed out and we're not charging for food yet.
so we'll wait on the sound system. - But you look happy, baby, don't you?
so happy. So happy. - Yeah, that's what's champing it.
uh-huh!
I got one. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
that's burnt. - So?
they're not paying for it.
come with me. Get off the truck.
you got this? - Yeah, I got it. You get down.
slow down for a second.
is this boring to you? - No, I like it.
Yeah, well, I love it.
everything good that's happened to me in my life came because of that.
I might not do everything great in my life, OK?
I'm not perfect. I'm not the best husband.
and I'm sorry if I wasn't the best father.
but I'm good at this.
and I wanna share this with you.
I wanna teach you what I learned.
I get to touch people's lives with what I do.
and it keeps me going, and I love it.
and I think if you give it a shot, you might love it too.
Yes, Chef.
now, should we have served that sandwich?
no, Chef.
that's my son. Get back in there. We got some hungry people.
he's ready to cook!
we did good, man. - We did good.
we got something here. - I say we stick with the traditional menu.
we don't get too fancy. - We'll get some yucca fries.
we got the fryer. - That's classic. Another beer, boss?
no, I'm good. - Alright.
here you go, little man.
you sure?
is this beer?
no, of course not. I would never hand you beer.
that's cerveza. - I'm 10. I can't have beer.
you're not 10. You're kitchen staff. Kitchen staff doesn't have an age.
dad?
you can have a sip.
huh?
like piss, right? - Worse.
you remember that when your friends offer you a beer.
I figure we go to South Beach... - Mm-hm.
stake out the truck a little bit, get the menu straight.
then after we're really confident we got something good, then we drive back to LA.
and hit a few extra cities on the way?
why not?
can I come? - Can you come?
come where? - On the trip.
this isn't a trip. We're just driving the truck back.
you're flying first class with Mommy with all the divorce money.
Yeah, but you're stopping in cities.
Yeah, but you got school. - I'm on break.
I don't know.
Martin, I like your mojo.
Hey, don't work me. - Oh, you hitting Martin?
you're working Martin? - Working me like that.
he's ice-cold. - He knows my soft spot, though.
he likes your mojo.
he got me, man. - We'll talk to your mom.
we'll see what she says. - I already did.
she's cool with it. - Look at that.
he's not... He's 10, he's got a phone.
good for you. Good for you, man. Get things done.
why not? Why not? Bring him along.
so I'm going?
Yeah.
Yeah, you can come. - I gotta go to the bathroom.
go by the backhoe.
you want me to take a poop over there?
Hey, Carl. Carl, check it out.
I'll drop you guys off at the hotel, and in the morning, you go get the rest of the ingredients, stock up on stuff, and I'll put a coat of paint on this.
don't bother painting. We'll paint it when we get back.
it looks fine like this. - No, man. This is on me.
my cousin knows a guy. I'm gonna hook it up. Alright?
OK.
who's hungry? Huh?
if you change your mind, you call me and I'll go get you anywhere.
come on. Let's sell sandwiches, baby!
OK, call me. - Come on, buddy.
Cuidado.

Yes, Chef. You know it. - Alright.

step aside, step aside.
thank you.

I need to talk to you on the side. - OK.

Yeah, permit's good. You're just not good to sell here right now.
OK, alright. Thank you. So just, what, a half-mile down the road?
Yeah. As long as you're not right on South Beach, you're OK.
no problem. Sorry about that. - Hey...
aren't you the lava cake guy?
uh, yeah, from the Internet. - Yeah.
Yeah.

Thanks. OK, great.

Yeah. - Hey, you know how to work this?
Hey, Martin, help me out. - What is that, a flat-screen TV?

Yeah. Yeah. - Alright, how do I... What do I press?

OK. - Let me make sure it's not on video.
it's on... Yeah, it's on. And then put on camera. There we go. Yeah.

you have to tap the centre of the screen, and when you see a box, make sure the box is around our head.
OK. - Whatever you're shooting's in the box.
just take the fucking picture, OK? - I got it.

Oh, and your finger's in front of the camera.

come on, you can do this. - OK.
you got it? You got it? Go.
I think I missed the exit.
Oww!
what the hell are you doing? You sending pictures to Mom?
I'm posting a Vine. - A Vine? What's a Vine?
it's a video. Look.
Hey, come on, man! Get that out of my face.
seriously. - Christ.
it's only six seconds. - Who'd make a video six seconds?
a six-second video. - Can you believe this generation?
unbelievable, man. Little attention. ADHD.
adhd is right. - That's nothing.
I've also been shooting these videos... one second every day.
one-second videos? Now you're joking with me.
no. You edit 'em all together.
one second of every day.
and then you cut 'em together and watch it. It's cool.
OK, enough with the virtual world. How about something real?
who wants to stop at Disney World?
Oh, yeah, I do. - Disney World? That's real?
we shouldn't stop till we hit New Orleans.
Hey! Hey, that is your son. - That's my boy.
a kid who'd rather go to New Orleans than Disney World.
now I've seen everything.
I can't wait to try my first beignet.
every other person you say 'New Orleans' to thinks jazz and voodoo.
Yeah, he thinks...
your kid thinks doughnuts. - Doughnuts. Yeah, I know.
I like that. Alright, New Orleans.

you know your son's a cook now?
I'm a line cook. - He's a line cook.

I'll have him home in time for school.
and you? Are you OK? - I'm amazing!
Oh, you're so sexy in that bandana. I want your big platanos.
looks here like you guys are having so much fun.
alright, give me one second. Did you know your son could work a grill?
I had beer. - What did he say?
stop. Stop, stop. He says he misses you.
Aww, tell him I love him.
dad got me a knife. - He says, "I love you.
what? - "I love you!
I love you too!

Bye.

# Every day and nothing seem to change #
# Everywhere I go, I keep seeing the same old thing #
# And I #
# I can't take it no more... #
let's take a selfie. - A selfie?
wait, let me do it with the flash. Hold on.
Oh, look at that. Email that to me, alright?
OK.

what is that, another Vine? - No, it's 'One Second Every Day' video.
remember?
it's the trip all cut together? - Oh, the little cuts of the thing?
Mm-hm. - Yeah, just email it to me.
I'm sure it's fine.
listen, I, uh... I want to talk to you about something.
yeah?
I've had a really good time with you these last couple of weeks.
me too.
and...
you've become a really good cook.
Thanks, Dad. - Not just for a kid.
I mean, you're really good. You work really hard.
it's a big deal.
but we're gonna be home soon, and we're gonna get back to our lives, and I'm gonna be really busy with the truck and you're gonna be really busy with school.
but I can still work on the truck, right?
you said I was a good cook.
I'm... I'm sorry, Percy.
I... I just don't want you to be disappointed when things go back to the way that they were.
I don't want it to go back to that.
I could work after school and on weekends.
I just want to be honest with you, OK?
I feel like I've let you down so much, and I didn't want to blindside you, but the summer's gonna end and we're not gonna be doing this anymore.
OK?
OK.
but we had a lot of fun, and nobody could take away from us what we experienced together, right?
and I feel like I really got to know you.
alright. Let's watch the music.
# Well, if things don't change around here #
# There ain't no use in me hanging right on #
# Hang around #
# But I'll be ready now #
# I'll be ready when my train pulls up #

I'm really gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too.
OK, but you'll stay with me in two weeks.
OK? - Yeah.
whole weekend. - Did you post the video yet?
I didn't look at it yet. Sorry. - Don't forget.
I won't. - I'll resend it.
OK.

Mwah!
Bye.
Oh, shit...

Hi.

I think I missed the exit.
beignets.
Hey, Dad. - Hi.
what's wrong? - Nothing.
what's up?
listen, I was... I was thinking, about what we were talking about.
yeah?
and it's gotta be OK with Mom. Let me just say that first.
what are you talking about?
I could really use your help on the truck.
you there?
Yeah.
and it's only for the weekends and after school after you're done with your homework, and the money goes into your college fund.
OK. Does that sound good?
that sounds pretty good.
mom! Dad wants me to cook on his truck!
no, really! He's on the phone.
mom wants to talk to you. I think it's yes. Hang on.

mole, two Cubanos, and order 21, slider.
thank you. - 21? Thank you.
there you go. I got yours coming. - Perfect. 15.
Yes. - OK. Thank you.
there's no food for you here.
could I speak to the Chef for just a second, please?
the hell you will.
can I talk to you?
next! Next!
what exactly are you doing here?
I'm, uh... eating the food. I'm eating your food.
I thought my food was needy and cloying.
well, I didn't think you'd want to serve me, so I sent somebody else to pick it up.
what happened between us, that really knocked me for a loop.
I mean, you robbed me of my pride and my career and my dignity.
and I know people like you don't usually care about that kind of thing.
that's not necessarily true.
but you should know, it hurts people like me.
cause we're really trying. - You started a flame war with me.
are you kidding me? I buy ink by the barrel, buddy.
what are you doing picking a fight with me?
I wouldn't challenge you to a cook-off.
I thought I was sending you a private message.
I didn't know that. I thought we were having fun.
it was theatre. By the way, what the fuck were you cooking?
you totally shat the bed, buddy. How could I back that?
you were one of my early boys.
I had no control over the menu.
whatever the case, OK? You seem to be cooking for yourself again.
because this shit is sensational.
I mean, really, really good.
thank you.
I'm not gonna write about it.
Yeah. I understand.
because I'd like to back you.
excuse me?
I wanna bankroll you, and I can't write about anything I have a vested interest in.
I'm not sure I get what's going on here.
I sold my website for a whole lot of money and I've just put in a bid on a place on Rose.
it's zoned, it's permitted. You could build it out however you like.
and you can cook whatever you like.
take your time, think about it.
I wouldn't blame you for having a few trust issues, but I just thought that, you know, you and me burying the hatchet might be a good story.
reservations out the door.
more importantly, you know, you just cook your ass off in there.
in the meantime, you just tweet me wherever you are and I'll come running.
cause this shit's good. Alright?
delicious!
Delicioso.
mucho goodo.
Hey, jefe. - Yeah?
that was a lot of talking and you not punching him.
so, what'd that asshole say, huh?
I think that "asshole" might be our new partner.
yo yo yo yo!
a mark. B mark.
looks good. It looks good already.
the heat is right on.
that's olive oil? - Yeah.
what are you grabbing over there?
you're grabbing all your cheese.
Yeah.
what are you doing there? Spreading it around or finding...
spreading it around. - What are you looking for there?
heat. Heat.
so it doesn't burn.
Where's the hottest spot? - Right here is the hot spot.
so you're controlling it all the time. You're always controlling.
color is a detail as well. And you're looking, you're looking.
as soon as you get your good color... This is now where you start it.
you start to really build the sandwich itself.
a light scrape.
so you can see, the whole sandwich starts to evolve.
and, see, the cheese is starting to evolve too.
Yes, you can do it. There you go.
getting in there.
you're almost...
even now, as you get further, Jon, you're getting in, like, assertive now.
you're changing... Even your grip's here.
Mm-hm. - Changing your positions.
you're moving around.
but you're not too busy with it. You're...
you're precise, but then sometimes you step back.
nothing else exists except this. - Right.
and if you fuck this up, everything sucks in the world.
what does "broccoli" mean?
depends on the context. Pubic hair or marijuana. It's a noun.
and "Virginia"?
vagina. As in, "He penetrated her virginia with a hammer.
Yikes! -Slang is either sexual or violent.
or both.
when it's witty, I think it's really witty.
Yeah.
Hello, how are you?
how are you?
Hi, how are you?
why didn't you say hi?
I nodded.
are you happy when you wake up?
no.
Hey, there was a petal storm out here this morning.
I saw that.
I thought it was a snowstorm.
I thought I was dreaming.
no, there's two stores we should go to in Soho.
it would not take very much for me to make you look very good.
you're sabotaging a fucking incredible figure, baby.
yo!
is that your student? It looks like he wants to eat you.
they all flirt. It's part of the ritual.
miss Avery, you're late. -Am I?
what, you trying to be ironic? -Hello.
what's happening? -I'm Pauline.
we talked this morning on the phone.
Yeah. -You look different than I thought.
thank you for sharing your bed.
Bye.
Bye.
I got a new word for you.
is this your usual?
are you gonna write that down?
you should be paying me for this.
you think so? -Yeah.
this is valuable shit.
aren't you afraid your book on slang is like a dis?
a dis on whom?
people like you think the brothers are guinea pigs......the way we talk and shit.
Cornelius, are you trying to tell me that you need an extension?
no. Look, I came to tell you I made a discovery.
see, I discovered I can call John Wayne Gacy...and hear him talk himself, Miss Avery.
Really? Dead murderers have their own phone lines?
he wasn't no murderer.
look, there be a website for serial killers...
you know, past and present.
he recorded and explained himself...
how he didn't kill no 33 boys.
I got radar for the truth...
and I'm gonna write how I know that.
this paper's not supposed to be about you.
that's the point of the assignment. -You said every word a writer writes...
even the commas and shit, gotta be a reflection of him or her.
that we be doing this writing shit to express our vision.
you know I got vision.
you know, I got Africa vision.
you know, I got bitch vision.
I got...
Yeah. Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.
come on, you guys, you were supposed to wait for me.
Hey, miss.
Hey, miss. Hey!
you forgot something.
the check.
stream of consciousness, I'd like to point out, is not the same as stream of conscience
for which some of you have mistaken it.
a logical error in some ways.
okay, your assignment for today is to utilize...
nothing happens. - style in To the Lighthouse.
Yeah, one old lady dies.
how many ladies have to die to make it good?
at least three.
what's this? -From the bar...my half of the check.
yo, man, where you go? I waited a long time.
couldn't find the bathroom. -Is that all?
is what all? -All I owe you.
I can't pass you unless you show up to class.
the still waters of the water under a frond of stars
the still water of your mouth under a thicket of kisses
the still waters of the water under a frond of stars
the still water of your mouth under a thicket of kisses
under a thicket of kisses -How you doing? -Do I know you?
detective Malloy.
are you Francis Avery?
I'm canvassing your apartment building. I wanna talk to you.
how do I know that's real?
it's still busy. Why don't you come back.
I'll wait, thanks.
can I smoke?
not in my apartment.
you got someplace I could put it out?
Thanks.
miss Avery, there was a homicide in your neighborhood on the 15th .
that'd be Saturday the 15th, last Saturday between 12 and 2 AM.
her body, or part of her body, to be exact, was found in the garden outside your window.
that's why I wanted to talk to you, in case you saw or heard anything.
no. No, nothing unusual.
Frannie, it's John Graham. Are you by yourself?
I don't think you're there by yourself.
why did you lie to me?
doesn't it mean anything to you that we slept together twice?
Yes, I do count that time in the shower. Quiet!
come on, pick up the phone.
pick up.
pick up. Pick up.
pick up. Come on, pick up the phone.
are you a writer?
what's all this?
words, quotes that I like, poetry.
is it, like, a job or a hobby?
a passion.
I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees.
is this you?
it's my sister.
my ex-wife had long hair, then she cut it.
so you don't remember seeing anything?
hearing anything?
Oh, my pen? It's fake. It's a cop thing.
you don't remember anything? Didn't see anything? Didn't hear anything?
no cries in the night?
no. I don't remember seeing or hearing anything unusual.
and I sleep with the windows open. -Yeah?
you do that a lot?
can you tell me how it happened?
her throat was cut.
and then she was disarticulated.
here's my card.
my number's there. lf you remember anything, give me a call, all right?
do I know you from someplace?
I don't know.
Thanks.
Oh, shit.
don't bullshit me. Look me in the eye. -I'm not.
now, you think about it, all right? Now, take a walk. Miss?
Oh, miss? Miss?
how you doing? Excuse me.
can I talk to you for a minute?
am I supposed to get in?
you want to talk on the street?
never think it's a good idea, putting your business on the street.
I'll get it.
this is my partner, Detective Rodriguez.
Hi. How you doing?
how do you do? -What the fuck is this?
it's coffee. -It's half a cup.
take it back. -He gives me a half a cup.
what, does he expect you to fill?
how long is this gonna take?
I'm sorry? -How long is this gonna take?
are you in a hurry? -Where you going?
my friend's. Half sister's. -We'll give you a lift.
so, what do you do? -I teach.
you teach what? -You get a chance to run those prints?
teach what? -English.
you know what an "isthmus" is?
isthmus be my lucky fucking day.
what the fuck? You ran the prints? -Yeah.
And? -Nada, nothing.
look, the reason we thought you might be able to help is the bartender Luther Wilker?
Yeah. -At the Red Turtle. -Well, he said you were there on the night in question.
he's got a good memory. -No, we have your credit-card receipt.
does that look familiar?
that's right.
I was at the Red Turtle with one of my students.
one of your students? -Cornelius Webb.
but it was early. It was 3: 30.
I was there for a short time, then I went home.
Cornelius Webb?
is that with two B's or not two B's?
you were in the front room the whole time?
Yes. -Are you sure?
didn't I just say so?
you didn't happen to see a Caucasian girl, mid-20s?
not too tall. Good-looking, wouldn't you say?
what? -She was good-looking?
she wasn't bad-looking. -Yeah, but she...
well, did you?
what is this about, exactly? -Listen, Miss Avery...
the deceased was seen in the Red Turtle the same night you were there.
seeing how you were there......
maybe you wouldn't mind taking a look at a few pictures.
sometimes you see something you don't remember.
take a deep breath. This one's kind of graphic.
well, do you recognize her?
no.
thank you.
Hey. Can't figure you out.
what do you mean? Am I a murder suspect?
look, I was wondering if you want to go for a beer or something.
I got a cousin who works in a bar in Sheridan Square...
and says a lot of writers go in there. -Now?
no, not now. I'm working now.
two hours from now. -Where?
here.
what the fuck?
you're a fucking wise guy?
we got nice girls and nicer drinks.
Oh, excuse me, baby.
Hey, Papi. -Hey.
good to see you. Look at you. -You are looking good.
is Pauline home?
sorry. -Oh, baby.
she could be up. She could be down.
you know, go check the bar, baby, okay? Hey, hey, hey, look.
that's cute. Is it real?
of course it be real. What, you crazy?
I don't let no psycho killer mess with my girls.
he'd be dead. Bye, baby.
I make sure no one fuck with my goddamn girls.
what is it?
what's wrong?
it's so humiliating.
is it the doctor?
do you want to go up?
okay.
Thanks, guys.
good luck. -Feel better.
what happened? -His receptionist called me with a referral to another doctor...
he canceled our appointment.
was this after you had sex? -He's right.
he shouldn't have had sex with me. I mean, of course he's right.
do you ever think about just imagining sex?
what do you mean? -Just thinking about the doctor...
not making appointments. Just...
just not really trying to have sex with him in reality.
that's kind of boring.
I mean, I do. I do restrain myself.
you know, I just-- I got so enthusiastic...
when I thought about him, and it confused me...
because I think enthusiasm is a good thing, you know.
I mean, I think about...
how many appointments did you make?
last week?
eleven.
how about I put on some music?
I waited outside his apartment.
I saw him and his wife...
and I followed her to the dry cleaner.
she left a tan suit.
did you pick it up?
what are you gonna do with it? -I don't know.
I feel like such a freak.
this is what I do to get a dick inside me.
you're not a freak.
I admire you.
you live out of your unconscious.
you're a poet of love.
the lovelorn man who
sick in soul and of this busy human heart aweary
worships the spirit of unconscious life
in tree or wildflower Gentle lunatic "Gentle lunatic." That's me.
I have something for you.
it's like a belated birthday thing.
I got it when I was styling that commercial that got canceled.
Oh, God, that's beautiful.
what is it? -It's a courtship fantasy.
see, there's a little wedding bell and a little house.
open the baby carriage.
Oh, God.
Oh, no, am I gonna have to feed this thing?
you should have a baby.
this is the closest I'll get.
and a man. You should have a man too.
somebody asked me out.
good.
who?
a police detective.
he's investigating a girl's murder. You know the one who got cut up?
Oh, my god. Yeah.
part of her body was found in my garden.
Yuck.
so is this detective good-looking?
he seems young. He's got a mustache.
they've all got that.
you didn't say no, Frannie?
Frannie?
you gotta go. Just for the exercise, you should go.
you wanna borrow some decent clothing?
can we look? -I think you should.
can you come with me? Come on.
get the woman a gin and tonic, and l'll have a bourbon and Coke.
you got it.
you know, I'm wondering if maybe you saw something at that bar.
I'm still wondering.
maybe something you don't know you saw.
your colored boyfriend, did he leave with you?
Cornelius? He's not my boyfriend.
and he left before me.
you saw him leave?
actually, no.
he's not into popping arms off of ladies' bodies, is he?
not that I know about.
what, my hands?
well, yeah, I know, I got faggot hands.
they're soft.
actually, I was wondering about your tattoo.
Oh, that?
I'm in a secret club.
are there many members?
Hey, listen...
I can be whatever you want me to be.
you want me to romance you, take you to a classy restaurant, no problem.
you want me to be your best friend and fuck you...
treat you good, lick your pussy...
no problem.
ain't much I haven't done.
the only thing I won't do is beat you up.
why does your partner carry a water pistol?
they took his gun away. -Why did they take his gun away?
because his wife caught him fucking a fat chick.
when she found out she ran upstairs and tosses his Hispanic Society trophy out the window.
and you know, that's pretty much when he tried to kill her.
that's a good reason to kill your wife, of all the reasons that I can think of.
he wasn't gonna kill her, lady.
he was just trying to scare her.
that was his San Juan Man of the Year Award, you know?
Ritchie takes that stuff seriously.
so those fat-fucking-fucks from IA, they got ahold of him...
they take his gun, take his badge...
they put him on modified duty and now he's a house mouse.
what are house mouses?
the guys who don't want to be on the streets no more or they're on modified duty like him.
you stare back at them. That's how you flirt with black girls.
Hey, Ritchie, what the fuck? They let you out?
what am I gonna do? What can I do?
nothing. You can't do nothing.
come here, bro.
lf loving you is wrong, I don't want to be right.
don't be. You want a drink? -Yeah.
Hi.
how you doing? -Hey, barkeep...
two shots of bourbon and two bourbon and Cokes.
I had to park on Christopher Street.
must have been 1 00 faggots looking to suck my dick.
I'm jealous. -Are all cops homophobic?
what are you, one of them feminists?
I thought you might be one as well, detective.
Why? -Malloy says that you like fat women.
you told her that? -Yeah, why not?
made me think you had a generous, even a sympathetic view.
you like fat girls? -Yeah.
Yeah, why? -I like fat chicks.
that chick. -Yeah. What's up?
that chick wants to suck your dick.
all you need are tits, a hole and a heartbeat.
you don't even need the tits.
you don't even need the heartbeat, pal.
you going fishing?
want me to clock you out? -No, I'll stay for a while.
miss?
I didn't hit you.
I'm not-- It's not my fault.
are you okay, miss? -Yeah.
are you okay? -Yes.
I give you a ride. -Okay.
are?
okay.
you okay? -Do you have a phone?
I give you.
Malloy?
it's me.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it looked a lot worse than it is.
you'll be all right. It's just a scrape.
did you get a look at him?
no, he was wearing a mask.
anything stand out? Like...
a smell, rings on his fingers, watch, shoes, anything?
how was that girl killed?
who? -The girl killed at the Red Turtle.
angela Sands?
she wasn't killed at the Red Turtle. You're getting confused.
what is "disarticulation" exactly?
listen, it's not likely that your assailant's the murderer, babe.
it's much more likely he's after your wallet.
so you won't tell me how she was killed?
you really want to know?
her throat was slit with a straight razor.
he was trying to take her head, maybe for a souvenir.
we found another dismembered female body last June along the river.
I think it's the same killer. Ritchie don't, but I do.
go over it again.
no. Show me.
come here. Show me.
he came from behind you? -I don't know.
did you turn?
he just grabbed my head in his arm. He had his arm around my neck.
so he must have come up from behind you, then.
was it his right arm?
or his left?
it was his right.
all right.
what's that?
take those off.
no.
what? Yeah.
that's it.
that's it.
I've been wondering about you. -Yeah? Don't.
I want to know. -Know what?
how you did that to me.
somebody taught you.
who was that? -Get the fuck out of here.
you can tell me.
an older woman.
an older woman, huh?
the chicken lady.
the chicken lady? -Oh, you know her?
when I was 15, I was delivering chickens for a butcher to housewives for a buck a chicken.
the first time I show up there, it was fucking hot, and...
I came to the door, she offered me a glass of water.
so we're in the kitchen talking about the weather or some shit...
and she just reaches out, she grabs ahold of my joint.
she asks me，
does that feel good?" I said, "Yeah.
and she asks me, "You ever been with a woman?
and I said, "Yeah. No.
so she takes me into the bedroom.
she takes her clothes off, and she's a real woman.
I mean, she's got pubic hair from here to here.
it's black and curly like those Spanish girls.
and I want to get the fuck out of there, so she grabs me...
and says, "Have you ever kissed a girl down there?
I said, "No."
so she wets her fingers.
she touches herself real soft.
she touches her clit and tells me to lick there.
tells me to put my tongue there, take my time, lick in a slow circle.
and after a while she came.
she asked me to give her...
get on top of her and look her in the eyes.
why did you go back? -My kids. I missed my kids.
I didn't know you had kids.
how would you?
my oldest boy wants to be a teacher. I don't know what happened to him.
it's like Martians landed and took over his brain.
what does he want to teach? -Schmoogs. Can you believe it?
Hey, I'm missing one of my...
I'm missing one of the charms on my bracelet.
maybe on West Broadway.
hey...
there's something I really do have to tell you.
Oh, yeah?
you've seen me before. I've seen you at the Red Turtle.
this whole time, I'm thinking, "I've seen this girl before."
and now you're telling me I met you at the Red Turtle.
I don't think so, babe. -It was dark...
and I had on my glasses.
and there was a man...
and a girl, and she was giving him a blowjob.
a blowjob?
and I watched. -Oh, you did, did you?
you like that sort of thing? You like watching?
you don't remember a girl with blue fingernails with diamonds in them?
what did you say? Blue fingernails?
she had brown hair? -Yes.
Yeah, what about her?
I think that's Angela Sands. That's the girl that was murdered.
but I wasn't with her. I think you saw something.
you should come to the station and look at some pictures as soon as possible.
swear you weren't there. -Swear to God.
I never seen you or her before in my entire fucking life.
I gotta get out of here.
Hey, I had a nice time.
Thanks.
Oh, God, I could have lost you.
then you let the detective fuck you. -I didn't let him, I wanted to.
have you ordered? -Double latte, no foam.
Yeah.
it's sore, huh?
so the detective guy's sexy?
you like him? You gonna see him again?
would you trust a guy who gets blowjobs in bars?
Yes.
I think he's a liar.
you think he's a liar, or he is a liar? Because, of course, we never lie, so...
I saw him in a bar with a girl.
wait.
a bar? -Yeah.
I thought you just met him. I thought that he rescued you.
lf you don't want him, I'll take him. -Forget it, Pauline. Forget it.
no, arrange an introduction with your lying detective.
who's that?
John Graham.
I thought you said he looked like a movie star?
he played a doctor on a soap. Now he's studying to be one.
Hi.
you look terrible. -Excuse me, sir. No dogs in here.
I know that.
will you be long? -I just ordered a coffee.
you're very tan. -Hi, John Graham.
Pauline. -How are you?
take your time. I'll wait.
don't look out there, because he's watching you.
Oh, he's so intense.
I remember every guy I ever fucked by how he liked to do it, not how I wanted to do it.
sometimes I think it's just me. I mean, are other women able to say，
"suck my dick, pinch my nipples, bend over"?
probably not "suck my dick."
here's what I think.
I think you can come over to my place and sleep there for a few nights...
maybe even a week. It would make me really happy.
and the mugger has your wallet, so he's gonna know where you live.
you know, you really have to see this detective again.
I ordered a coffee.
miss, we ordered a latte.
no foam. -No foam, very, very dry. Thank you.
he's still there.
whose car did you get into yesterday? It looked like it'd just come from Beirut.
I don't know how people can drive around in filthy cars.
maybe one of my students. -Are you dating a student?
pardon?
you went to the Red Turtle Bar with a black student.
are you dating him? -No.
I saw you last Saturday.
what were you doing? -Is that the point? I don't think so.
the point is that he could get the wrong idea.
you don't know how guys think.
are you all right, John?
not really. I've...
I've been having these panic attacks lately.
I don't know. They're pretty bad. -What happens?
do you ever get these funny images from the past, like you saw something or you knew something?
weird memories from childhood?
I just wish I didn't keep having these funny attacks. My brain...
well, my brain practically explodes. I'm gonna go on antidepressants.
I need to ask you a favor.
do you think you could take care of Patrick?
he's barking all the time. Probably because my hours are so long.
John, I can't take care of a dog.
especially not my dog, right? You'd rather cut his head off.
no, not especially your dog.
why don't you put up a notice or something.
put up a notice? Where am l? I'm in the hospital 18 hours out of 24.
you don't get it, do you?
well, okay. Come here.
say goodbye.
John, are you gonna put him down?
maybe. I don't know, maybe I will.
I could do it myself. I could shave his little arm
I don't think it's a good idea that we see each other.
fuck!
fuck.
well...
fuck.
well, this is out of the blue.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna have to think about this.
midway along the journey of our life I woke to find myself in a dark wood...
for I had wandered off from the straight path.
Thanks.
thank you.
I fell over.
truly? -Yours truly.
you don't never talk.
it's always just jive. -Well, I like to be ironic.
I'm looking for Miss Avery, Francis Avery?
she's gone. Her class is finished. -It's over?
which one is it? This one down here? -She might still be in the staff lounge.
I've been thinking on Gacy, you know?
pogo the Clown?
I've been thinking that it wasn't his fault, you know?
like, he were the victim.
what do you know about Cornelius Webb?
of what?
desire.
aren't you gonna help carry my bag? -No.
you're an Amazon, Miss Avery. That's like an insult.
so we're here? -Yeah.
Hey, Papi. -Hey, baby.
I'm gonna help you upstairs. -No, I got it. Thank you.
no, let me help you upstairs. -I really don't-- Okay, bye.
good night.
let me get this for you. -I got it. Thank you, Cornelius.
you okay? -Yeah.
you sure?
Oh, that was very smooth, Daddy.
Oh, that turned me on. That was nice. Give me a kiss.
go away, man! -Don't do that. Come here.
don't do that. -Sit right here. Oh, you are so sexy.
help me put my earring back in. Come here.
in 1 97 8, Mr. John Wayne Gacy was in trouble...
when the police dug up a dead body under his cellar.
when the police were done, they had 2 7 dead bodies.
most of them from under the house.
he said he was innocent of the crime...
and sometimes he said that he loved those boys.
he never said he was sorry.
not even at the end, when they gave him his lethal injection.
"he was chatty, " his guard said.
he wanted to discuss the Chicago Cubs and eat fried chicken.
I'm gonna take a sleeping pill. Two, in fact.
do you want one?
no.
it's so fucking noisy I can't sleep. I have to move.
I mean, clearly, I have got to move.
why don't you see him again.
you're brave in so many ways. You're thinking about him, right?
about sex. -So?
you wouldn't be thinking about the sex if you didn't like him.
well, at least call him. He doesn't know where you are.
I go to court tomorrow...
because of the tan suit.
they're trying to get a restraining order against me.
probably won't be allowed within 500 miles of Dr. Cass' office.
Yeah, laugh it up.
you know what I'm thinking? -What to wear.
no, I'm imagining that when he sees me...
he's gonna realize that he's in love with me, and, you know...
one thing will lead to another, and after a love child or two...
you will be visited by Cesar Millan.
Yes!
on the men's team, project manager James
dealt with insubordination from David.
if you mutter something like that under your breath again,
you're benched.
on the women's team,
project manager Tyana's decisions were questioned.
my mom has a salon.
I worked the front desk for 15 years.
I think I really belong at the front desk.
I was thinking I could take up reception.
Tyana does not want to give me a responsibility
where I'm going to shine.
screw her. It's time for her to go home.
the next day, celebrity dog trainer
cesar Millan came to visit...
we spend -- we...
we installed some webcams as well,
Yeah. Right. We'll...
too many leaders in one pack creates conflict.
...while the women showcased their creativity.
Uh-huh.
and then we attach their photo at the end. Ohh.
when the results were announced...
as far as the women are concerned,
they absolutely loved what you did.
...the women celebrated their second straight victory.
left to face Mr. Trump, Steuart called out David.
I am offended for what happened with David.
not good.
insubordinate.
Yes. Very.
but the team targeted their project manager.
James was a poor leader through and through.
and Wade made a promise to mr. Trump.
fire James,
and I'll step up as a project manager to manage the next task.
in the end, it came down to leadership.
you really lost because of your project manager.
James, you're fired.
I have an issue with Dave,
and I'll bring it up to him if he comes back here.
I agree. And I said -- and I
he can hold that against me or not.
whatever. But that was a team issue.
david condescended james in front of our client,
and I called him out on it.
that was really one of the main reasons why we lost.
I have absolutely zero respect for that guy.
Oh, my god!
you're captain offensive,
and you throw me over the bus for mumbling something?
no.
here. If you don't want to listen to me, then you can't
no. No, no. That was b. S.
Steuart rubbed me the wrong way in the boardroom.
I was very unhappy with the things he said about me,
and I don't take disrespect very well.
in the boardroom, I said I will step up
as project manager and bring us to a win.
I want it, but I'm not gonna step on your toes
and do a knee-jerk reaction, either.
okay, man. Are you gonna be upset if I take it?
no, I'm not. Okay.
I already knew I was gonna be project manager.
I don't care what anybody said.
but when Wade comes back
after getting drilled in the boardroom,
he was extremely motivated when he said, "guys, I'd really -- I really think"
I'd be a good project manager.
I-I rea-- I would really like to be the next project manager.
it was just wimpy and weak.
okay. As long as you're okay with it.
all right, man. I'm good with it.
I respected Clint.
you know, I'm not going to create problems
before we even step into a task
and go into a task with bad feelings.
so this task, win or lose, falls on Clint.
money, money, money, money
money
money, money, money, money
money
some people got to have it
Hey, hey
some people really need it
Hey, listen to me, y'all
do things, do things, do things
bad things with it
dollar bills, y'all, come on
that mean
Oh, mean
mean green
Almighty dollar
don't you know that money
give me a nickel, brother
can you spare a dime?
money can drive some people out of their minds
for the love of money
no good, no good
money
money, money, money, money

Hello, mr. Simmons.
my name is Tyana Alvarado.
Tyana. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
have a seat. Thank you so much.
my reward for being the winning project manager
was getting to meet Russell Simmons.
Mr. Simmons is one of the most powerful entrepreneurs
that exists.
he basically has his hands in almost everything,
from clothing to music to management.
you have every opportunity.
you're breathing the same air as the billionaires. Mm-hmm.
first thing you do is you write down a plan.
Yeah. Correct.
and you -- and you put together something that's inspiring... mm-hmm.
...that you think you could sell somebody.
Mm-hmm. Second thing you're gonna do
is start to execute on it. Mm-hmm.
and you get the people who like your idea
to support your efforts.
and this is how every business has started. Right.
my favorite thing that he said was that I'm breathing
the same air that the billionaires are breathing.
and it just puts into perspective, really,
how we're all the same
and it's just a matter of what you make of yourself.
tell Donald I said hello. I will, mr. Simmons.
wait, wait. Come back.
um, this was given to me for you. It's from Donald.
Oh.
all right? Take it. Thank you so much.
good luck to you. All right.
on my way out, Russell handed me this envelope from mr. Trump.
Calvin Klein has very generously rewarded you
with a $10, 000 gift card.
to have $10, 000 to go shopping and have professional attire
and buy my winning dress for the finale
it's such a wonderful gift.
good morning.
good morning, mr. Trump.
the popcorn business is a big business.
17 billion quarts of popcorn are sold each year.
and one of the biggest and brightest Of all of these companies that make popcorn
is called popcorn, Indiana.
we have with us Hitesh, the c. E.O.
what popcorn, Indiana offers
is great-tasting, 100% all-natural snacks.
even though we're growing so fast,
we want to make sure we reach out
to all of those who are still missing out.
and that's where the internet comes in.
so your task today is to create a guerilla-marketing stunt
that you will make into a video.
the winner of this task will have the video
that has the best potential to go viral.
thank you.
Ivanka, who are they gonna be working with?
you'll be working with Charlie Todd.
Yeah!
and he's actually staged an event right here in Trump tower.
men, who is your project manager?
I am, sir. Yes, sir. Clint.
Wade felt like he thought he'd step up,
but this had been decided before, so...
you know, last week, we lost
because we had a horrible project manager,
and I saw the guys around me giving up.
this week, I'm the quarterback, and we're gonna get there
because I'm leading us there.
ladies, who is your project manager?
I'm an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn.
they keep letting people go,
and I have a caseload of about 150 cases.
what if there's another round of cutbacks?
I'm gonna change my position in life,
and I will stop at nothing to win.
you know, you have a disadvantage in this case
because I can see the way this guy likes popcorn.
so good luck.
let's see who does the best job. Thank you.
thank you, mr. Trump.
Hey, guys.
david has a tooth emergency. His tooth just fell out.
if you're only missing half a tooth,
respect the team and get the job done.
and later...
guerilla is, like, some huge scene.
not three scene. One huge scene.
Tyana didn't like any of the ideas we were coming up with.
she didn't contribute anything creatively.
first of all, you guys, I'm gonna be very bossy.
let's just win.
we get it. It's fine. Let's just win. Let's just win.
do what you've got to do. The task is to produce a video
of a guerilla-marketing stunt to promote popcorn, Indiana.
I'm going to be a very strong project manager.
I'm here to be the boss.
so we have to find out who their target market is.
look. They're very wholesome.
Indiana.
popcorn, Indiana is a very wholesome company,
so nothing vulgar -- something fun.
I'm Liza.
so, improv everywhere is a group that I started.
we're very well-known for our events,
like getting 200 people to freeze in place
in grand central station.
Charlie Todd is the expert of making
these crazy, zany videos that have, you know,
generated an enormous amount of hits on the internet.
so he really gave us some tips on what people
are interested in seeing on the internet.
what has been successful for you?
I mean, you want to cause a scene.
you know, you've got to grab them immediately, right?
and you have to give them a reason to stick around
and watch your whole video.
all right. Let's take a look at
this is from the no pants subway ride of 2009.
you know, the basic premise is, you're sitting in a subway car...
Oh, my god.
...and somebody walks in in their underwear,
and then all of a sudden,
there's more people in the subway car in their underwear
than there are in their pants.
the video has over 2 million views on youtube.
that's great.
and it's something so simple.
it's got to be un-staged. It's got to not be contrived.
we got to get out, and we got to make a scene.
we had to go big or go home.
everything on the internet is humorous.
I think humor's the way to go.
so you eat it, and then you turn into something fresh?
Yes.
in a movie theater.
I know what viral videos are.
it's something that, when someone watches,
they think is so funny
that they have to forward it to all their friends.
this is nothing like what a viral video is supposed to be.
I just want to keep reminding
this is supposed to be a huge, like, outdoor
kind of stunt thing.
a movie theater is closed in.
well, we'll do different things. You're right.
like, the family's all on a road trip or something
in the car, everyone's bored, and then all of a sudden,
they start eating popcorn, and then it's a party.
but we can't get -- we're not going in a car. It has to be...
a family -- honestly, guerilla is, like,
so we could do family on vacation.
not three scenes. One huge scene.
Tyana spent the whole morning complaining,
but she wasn't offering any substantive ideas.
she spent more time complaining than she did contributing,
and we were all sick of hearing it.
can we go to a gym and, like, have everybody
in, like, tuxedos or, like, formal gowns?
or what if you're eating?
you're on the stairmaster,
and you have, like, a full, like, bag of popcorn.
that's good!
and you're just like, "whew!
we really wanted to have this quirky idea
of having somebody, you know, working out hard in the gym
while eating a snack.
I think it's funny as hell!
and I think that it's a funny, unexpected way
to advertise popcorn.
you three, you guys
in charge of getting all the supplies
and getting back here as soon as possible.
wait. Why all three of us?
Plus, there's a lot to carry.
there's a lot to carry. You got to break up in Kmart. And go through the store.
weren't really contributing as much as the other girls,
so I decided to send them
to go take care of the outfits and come back.
this is what I think
we get a public place, get two guys that we choose
start having a popcorn fight. And then it escalates into two...
and people start running out from everywhere, throwing popcorn.
and then people just start hitting each other with the bags of popcorn.
what -- what -- what
like, hit people in the face in the lobby.
it sounds like it's a company
that we don't want to push the -- push the envelope too far.
that's what I got.
I'm a little concerned that
my kids are always on the internet looking at viral videos.
I think this needs to be a kid-friendly task.
this is a little bit too in-your-face.
I don't know if I want my kids
seeing people getting hit over the face with a bag of popcorn.
I like it culminating in a big fight.
I like everything we've talked about.
I like having the small deal
escalating into a final scene, big fight.
is it too far?
I think I could lose a tooth on this bagel.
we all loudly together on cue -- "share some"!
then we all start throwing popcorn at each other.
the entire center of my tooth just came out.
I was eating,
and a bagel piece took half of my tooth out.
we have the individual fight scenes.
so, I have half a tooth in my face right now
and a hole all the way down to the root.
my tooth just came out.
is it okay if I go and do it right away?
I got your back. I got your back.
Yeah, I just
Hey, guys, David has a tooth emergency.
his tooth just fell out. He's gonna get it handled.
Yeah, go get better and then come back. Get better, bro.
if I had broken my tooth off, I would have still stuck around.
he could have gone to the dentist the next day.
if you're only missing half a tooth, so be it.
respect the team and get the job done.
if we do lose, David is just a goner.
but I will be overjoyed that he's not there.
you better get back, David.
I hope the other girls aren't upset, like, "oh, we've just been running errands all day. We're not in the van.
whatever. We'll make it up to them the second they come. No.
the task is to produce a video
of a guerilla-marketing stunt to promote popcorn, Indiana.
I decided that Liza, Tyana, and Poppy
were gonna come on and help creatively with the task,
because it was supposed to be a collaborative effort
with the entire team.
and you two will take care of the food.
cause it's like, to cut them out completely,
they're gonna be like, "this is no ownership of mine."
I think it's great.
so, I'm Mahsa.
I'm gonna be directing this. This is my team.
the actors that are not in gym clothes,
you're gonna go with this lady, the blonde right here.
we had 20 extras, and they needed
to act out the holding the popcorn and working out.
and they also needed to act out the reaction
to the person who was working out with the popcorn.
okay.
you got it?
Liza, Poppy, and I were shopping,
so we have no idea what was discussed or anything
while we were gone.
okay, so, now you guys are helping with the creative.
they're gonna take care of the food and the stuff,
and you guys are gonna help me with the creative.
when we got to the gym,
strategically, Mahsa probably realized
that she wasn't giving us enough responsibility to pin on us,
so she quickly changed it
and tried to give us the creative part.
so, she wants you to have one of these cams.
okay. And you just turn it on here.
essentially, we're just told, "grab the flip camera and record."
so if we failed in that responsibility,
she could use that as an excuse to bring us into the boardroom.
action!
beautiful!
we're gonna film two -- we're gonna film them walking
and, like, holding hands
and kind of gazing in each other's eyes.
and then we're gonna film another one.
we're gonna film two -- twice.
we wanted to be outside
because that's how we could generate the biggest scene.
what better place than the heart of manhattan, 5th avenue,
right out in front of Trump tower?
I want you to run from behind and just whack him.
it's gonna be right here.
do you want him on the outside?
I want him on the outside.
I need you to swap positions. I need you to be on the outside.
what we decided to do was have this prankster...
instigate a popcorn fight.
three, two...
action!
Aah!
so, basically, I run around
and harass six different groups of people
and ultimately got them involved in a popcorn fight.
and cut.
perfect. Great job, guys. That was fantastic.
Hi, gang.
how's it going, project manager?
thank you for coming to see us. It's going very good.
I didn't have to go far. This couldn't be more convenient.
no, we did this for your convenience.
so, tell me -- what's going on?
so, let me lay it out for you.
we're trying to have a huge -- like, a pillow fight... okay.
...to stop traffic, to have everybody looking
and seeing what's going on, popcorn flying everywhere.
I don't necessarily see this viral video
as catching ablaze on the internet.
I think it could be funny if executed well.
I just don't know if it has the potential to be hilarious.
let's go ahead. Let's get everyone else informed.
keep going. Come on. Really work out.
really work out, sir. Come on. You can do it, Matt.
now get a wide shot.
really, the whole point is he's gonna be working out
and eating popcorn at the same time.
and it's just catching the reactions of everybody.
mahsa seems to be doing a great job.
I mean, she really looks like what I would imagine a director
would be doing, so she seems to be doing a very good job with it.
go. Start working out.
get a wider shot. Cut!
you keep doing the same thing, and you can tone it down a little.
just a little more natural and just grab it.
and nobody else talk.
I see a couple of the team members
seem to be a little bit m. I.A. a little bit quiet.
perhaps she's taking too much control.
excellent. Cut. That's good.
Where's the -- my yoga?
but if she's the one making all the decisions,
it's gonna be very hard for her to say, "well, someone else is at fault,
if in fact they don't win.
very good. That was great.
y'all walk back and stand, you know, right back here
on the other side of this guy with the umbrella,
right over there.
here comes the final scene.
we've got our extras standing around in pouring rain.
don't shoot down.
shoot up if you can because I don't want
any wet popcorn on the ground.
and you look around, and we're already drawing a huge crowd,
even before we ever start.
so I was pumped. I was happy.
roll it.
three, two, one!
action!
Hey!
Whoo!
Yeah!
get them!
Whoo!
what's more fun Than shutting down midtown manhattan In front of the trump building.
and if this thing doesn't go viral,
then there's no such thing as viral.
share some!
if we fail, it was purely because of the concept
and purely because popcorn, Indiana doesn't think
that it was too funny to be hitting people Over the head with a bag of popcorn.
I think it was a huge risk,
and, win or lose, Clint took the risk.
I like this take right here
where the guy gets hit in the face.
Yeah, this is fantastic. Watch this.
Hey!
that's a good angle!
it's pretty in-your-face.
there's an audience of kids there
that we might be pushing the envelope with.
that is awesome!
Yeah, that's good.
Yeah. I like that.
Yeah, yeah, yes.
right there. Let's get that whole thing.
it really worked out.
this is phenomenal.
it's just so frustrating
seeing the footage that's being picked to be edited.
like, it's not funny. It's so boring.
I'm just gonna say something.
if this doesn't work for us,
we might just try to use something funny,
because we would hate to lose...
this is what's gonna work,
and we have no time to change it around.
we're gonna pick the funniest thing that we have With all the footage.
there is no other way to cut this footage.
Tyana, the entire time, was saying that she didn't like
any of the ideas we were coming up with.
that's just so she could protect herself in the boardroom.
that's crystal clear to me.
she didn't contribute anything creatively to this task.
I'm not going back.
Mm-hmm.
let's make it work with what we have.
it's the only thing we have.
mahsa shut me down.
I want to tell her so much I'm on her side,
and so I'm just watching us drown.
and it's so frustrating.
I just can't imagine us winning this task.
good, Hitesh. How are you?
good. Ready to see some videos? Yeah. I'm excited to see them.
excellent. So, the first one is the women's team.
okay.
"lunch-break workout." "lunch-break workout." all right.
what do you think, Charlie?
I think it's funny.
I mean, the general idea of eating popcorn
while you work out, I think, is an absurd premise.
I mean, you don't obviously Typically see people eating while working out.
on the other hand,
maybe they didn't go far enough with it.
from a brand standpoint, I think it's all about enjoyment
and bringing the essence of the brand out.
so we'll see what the next one has -- has to do with it. Yeah.
this one's called "kettle corn chaos."
share some!
share some!
to be continued..." wow. So there -- there's more.
can't wait. Exactly.
I mean, that one made me laugh.
there was popcorn everywhere.
exactly. Something exciting is happening.
it's a little violent, you know.
I mean, it is, like, there's someone standing in the street. Very true.
and somebody comes up and just hits them with a bag of popcorn.
from a brand perspective, I don't know if you guys Want to get across the message that, "if you like our popcorn,"
you'll go hit people in the face with it. right.
so, I think they're two good videos.
I think you have a tough choice. They are both
we have a tough choice ahead of us.
Yes, sir? Do you think you won?
I really do, sir. Yes, sir.
Why? Concept.
you always say, "go big or go home."
we decided to go big.
and we wanted to make a spectacle,
and I think we did that.
Anand, do you think you won?
I am very confident that we won.
what did you think of your project manager?
I think he was excellent.
you know, I think, after the first few weeks,
it was a breath of fresh air to have a leader like Clint.
thank you.
Wade, why didn't you step up as project manager?
I tried to step up.
and I told you I'd step up,
and I went in, and I -- and I had a conversation with Clint.
and clint had said that he wanted to be project manager.
I didn't want to go and fight
and get our team started on the wrong foot.
and in the end, I thought
it was best for our team to just stick to our plan.
I'm stepping up next week.
Steuart, let me ask you a question.
was David a distraction?
david really wasn't there most of the project
due to a dental malfunction.
what happened, David?
a bagel split my tooth in half,
Ugh. Ugh.
a bagel did this to your tooth?
Yes, ma'am. Yes. This is new york. We have great bagels.
I know.
seriously, how did that happen? What happened?
I had a root canal in the tooth,
and they put a temporary filling in it,
and they said it was good to go.
and when I pulled the bagel,
I pulled part of the tooth one way,
Ugh.
are you in pain right now? Sir, I am.
but, you know, I'm here for a reason.
Steuart, did you have a better team without David?
I think we had an excellent team.
without David?
well, David wasn't there. So we had an excellent team.
I'm very confident we won.
Mm-hmm.
how do you think you did, Mahsa?
I think we did excellent, mr. Trump.
that means you won.
Yes. I -- no, no.
I think we won.
I don't know.
that's a great answer.
we're doing great.
how do you think your team did?
I'm really confident in our video. I think it's excellent.
do any of you feel that maybe you're not so hot In terms of your video, or do you really like it?
shocker. Shocker.
why "shocker"? Weakest member of the team.
the who? The what? That's why
that's who should be fired, mr. Trump.
the biggest member of the team?
and the weakest.
Oh, the weakest?
the biggest.
well, that's a pretty tough statement.
do you think she is the weakest member of your team?
Absolutely. I thought that last week, too.
I think she's been the weakest on every single task
since the beginning, mr. Trump.
Tyana, you probably shouldn't have raised your hand.
Mr. Trump -- she didn't help. She didn't help at all.
she took herself out of this from the very beginning.
she was thinking about the boardroom. No, I didn't.
this is a creative -- absolutely not.
she didn't help with the concept.
she didn't help with the execution.
she didn't help with the editing.
now, if your team wins, would you take that back? No.
No! no.
Mr. Trump. Go ahead.
I'm not fake.
the minute we walked into our war room,
everyone started brainstorming.
nobody was going for guerilla marketing.
I'm like, "girls, this is not an event."
this is not what we're supposed to be doing.
so, you didn't like the concept?
what was your idea, Tyana? What was your idea?
it wasn't. My point is
what was your idea? What was your idea?
it doesn't matter what my idea was.
did you want us to just sit around and just wait?
we had a deadline. 12: 00 noon.
can you let me know when I can talk?
cause I'm not in the mood to
Yeah. You can talk. Thank you.
um, I -- I -- my whole point is,
we didn't do the task. We didn't complete
so, do you think you lost?
I think we lost.
all right, I want to see this viral video of the women.
what?
are you happy with that, Mahsa?
Yes, I'm happy with it.
Clint, what'd you think of it?
I think we won, mr. Trump.
you don't like it?
I think we knocked their socks off.
well, mr. Trump...
part of the definition of what we were tasked to do
was to create, in essence, a stunt,
and what we did was pulled off a stunt.
and in that video, I did not really see a stunt.
all right.
I want to see the men's video right now.
share some!
not impressed, mr. Trump.
I thought it was disrespectful to the product.
I didn't think that that was the -- an event, a stunt.
it was the guys throwing popcorn at each other.
we only shut down 5th avenue.
well, you know what was interesting to me? Tyana was laughing.
because Tyana's evil.
well, no, but Tyana was laughing.
Tyana, did you think it was...
I thought it was way better than ours.
it was an event. It drew a c-- they -- they made it look like a crowd.
made it look like a crowd"?
we closed down 5th avenue.
we shut down 5th avenue.
right. I mean, that is an event.
we drew a crowd. In the rain.
in the rain, we had people with umbrellas
standing three lanes out into 5th avenue,
and the street was literally shut down.
okay.
Ivanka, give me the pros and cons of the men's team, please.
the executive loved the fact
that the video made him laugh out loud.
he really appreciated that.
he loved the spontaneous quality of the video.
and that it was really an event. It was a large staged event.
what he thought was a negative was,
he thought the brand's tag line was hard to hear.
it wasn't very clearly articulated.
he also thought that you guys were a bit violent
Mm-hmm.
don, the women's team.
well, for the women, they thought it was a clever idea.
it was a, you know, fun concept.
I think the irony of eating popcorn while working out,
you know, created a juxtaposition
that they actually liked.
the cons were that it was kind of casual,
looked a little contrived, not necessarily guerilla,
and that it didn't really go far enough.
it was a little bit limited -- it wasn't as extreme
as it could have probably been.
okay. Are you ready?
Yes, sir.
my wonderful friend and executive from popcorn, Indiana
thought very distinctly...
that the men's team...
Yes!
good job.
good work, boys.
Clint, congratulations.
thank you, sir.
as your reward, you're going to meet A great gentleman, a great publisher and editor,
the head of forbes magazine, mr. Steve forbes.
Oh, yes! wow!
and you'll really enjoy steve. He's a fantastic guy.
good job. Awesome. Thank you, sir.
so good luck, and give him my regards, okay?
thank you. I will, sir. Thank you so much.
thank you, sir.
you can watch on television if you'd like.
and I have a feeling you'll be watching.
minus one tooth, and we still prevail. Ha ha!
women, stay here.
one of you is about to be fired.
so, Tyana, what happened?
you saw what happened, mr. Trump.
I tried so many times to get us in the right direction.
do you agree that the executive was correct?
Yes.
you thought the men did a better job. It was an event!
and it was interesting, and there was -- there was a crowd. And
I think you're actually focusing on the right thing,
the fact that
I feel that your video was not responsive to the task.
it really wasn't an event. It was a commercial.
can I ask you something?
Yes. If I
going into the gym to film,
I had less than an hour,
it was like war, I was trying to coordinate.
are you a bad time manager? Absolutely not.
we left at 4-- everyone had the same amount of time.
we left at 4: 15 because of the time the gym would close.
I had to coordinate 50 people.
I asked Liza, Tyana, and Poppy to help me, just like
but didn't you choose the location of the gym?
we did. Just -- so how can you be complaining about that?
because what I'm saying, mr. Trump, is Tyana should have helped us
push ours a little bit more. I directed the whole thing by myself.
shouldn't you have delegated that to someone else, though?
you knew that she was against the concept That you were going with, and you still opted to put her
in a position to direct something she didn't believe in. She was just being negative.
no. Every single person was part of the creative concept.
she, Liza, Poppy would also help direct this.
this was not just one person.
I wasn't gonna leave them out and have them come here.
Liza, you're rolling your eyes. What's going on?
the reason I'm doing that is because
if she really thought that we were really strong
at the concept, then she shouldn't have sent us
to go and take care of the shopping list.
by the time
so you really blame your project manager?
well, she's trying to say that we lost because of Tyana
no, not Poppy.
but at the end of the day -- and what about Liza?
did you lose because of Liza?
well, 'cause you're saying that -- well, what about Poppy? Mr. Trump, I was alone.
poppy was with us, too, and she didn't do a good job, either?
no. Mr. Trump, mr. Trump. She didn't direct?
Liza wasn't around when
the -- the most vital part of this
is when we were executing the task,
and we were shopping.
Mahsa, if you did it all by yourself and you lost,
why shouldn't I fire you?
because, mr. Trump, as a leader,
you have to delegate people to come assist you.
Yeah, but Liza's telling me you were not a good leader.
Yes.
if you were me, who would you fire?
I would fire -- look, it's easy to say right now
no, no, no. Look. I'm asking you a very simple
Tyana. I would fire Tyana.
Tyana? She's the one that didn't want to do the concept. Yes.
but she didn't come up with any other solutions.
is Mahsa able to take direction?
if you guys gave her good ideas, I mean,
was she able to listen to those ideas,
or would she only go with what she's thinking?
this is what she would say.
she would say, "okay, guys. What do you think about this?"
okay. Done. you know? She does. She's able to take direction.
what idea did you have?
that's not true. It was a collaborative team effort.
help me, Brandy.
I was taught -- and I think
this is great advice for everybody on the team
don't come to me with your problems
unless you have a solution.
exactly. That's how I have been taught to conduct business.
but she had no ideas.
exactly. Exactly.
so you're opposed to Tyana, not your project manager?
I certainly think that Mahsa did a great job.
Why? Because I think that once
you lost. She was project manager.
no, it's true, but a lot of us, including myself
Tyana disagreed with what she was doing, and you lost.
she didn't offer a solution.
that's true.
who would you fire, Liza?
I would fire...
I would actually fire tyana.
Whoa!
what? Did she say Tyana?
that was a critical error on Liza's part. Oh, how crazy!
Mahsa, you escaped!
no. No. Let me tell you why I would do that, mr. Trump, because she
no. Let me tell you why.
who's that weak -- Liza?
no, we were all sitting, editing the video.
we all wanted to make sure the best impact was being made.
we had already done the footage.
this is a fundamental business issue. Okay. Kelly. Kelly.
you don't get to check out of a business
I never checked out.
you have an obligation to give 150% every time. I did.
Oh, well, doesn't she do that?
she didn't this week.
you think, kelly, she takes a backseat?
I think she -- I think she -- I did not take a backseat.
Yes.
but she doesn't offer solutions. Yes. No. Not at all.
this is business. Poppy, what do you think?
I have to be honest.
during the editing process, I didn't feel a whole lot of support from you.
it wasn't funny! I sat there, and they were picking out reactions.
okay, but they chose the task, so now you have to move forward together.
right. So I completely
she did nothing. She did nothing. As soon as they decided this is the task, I said, "okay, fine. Whatever you want me to do, Mahsa.
no, no, no, no. But your answer to that
was, you didn't think it was funny, and that's why.
no, no, no. No, no. I never removed myself. You removed yourself.
you need to try to help make it better.
I did not check out, mr. Trump.
but is she ultimately the reason that you lost, because of that?
I got a question for you guys. Do you think that if you made
the video a little bit more extreme
exactly. That's exactly right.
Yes! yes! so the concept was not the problem.
wait, wait, wait. You just said "yes,"
Mahsa, but I actually specifically
heard you say, "tone it down. That's a little too much."
you're agreeing with me, 'cause I was there watching you guys.
one of the actors was scaring people.
correct, but if they were extreme, wouldn't that be viral?
he was, like, putting popcorn in his pants.
isn't that the definition of what you were looking for?
it was too much. And you said to tone it down.
with that actor, it was too much.
all right.
Mahsa, pick two people to come back into the boardroom.
Tyana and Liza.
okay, everybody go out.
the three of you, you'll come back.
somebody will be fired.
Amanda, let them in.
ladies, you can go back in now.
Mr. Trump's ready for you.
earlier you called Tyana evil.
do you believe that?
I think that she's lazy.
I think she's been a weak member
from the very beginning of this entire competition,
which is why every single person in here
told you that she should be fired, though, Tyana. Everybody did say.
Mr. Trump
you know, this wasn't -- wait.
but this was not like, you know, like most people.
no, no. Because I was the only one
who opposed the idea and was so verbal about it.
so they're saying that I wasn't performing.
it's actually easier for them to say
that the project manager should be fired
no. Mr. Trump
Liza, you're nodding in agreement.
I mean, do you think Tyana was the weak link?
well, at the end of the day, we had a task,
and the concept was picked by the project manager.
so you either show up or you go home.
and I showed up!
you showed up, and you sat in the corner. You showed up and
I didn't. I was sitting
..."oh, we like that shot. We don't like it."
I sat next to her and watched it! we were hustling to put this thing together.
and you know what? If you had this tremendous vision...
I never said I had a vision.
...that we were going in the wrong way, why wouldn't you help us?! all I said -- yes!
come out there -- I was by myself.
but you didn't have a solution. I felt -- why
but, Tyana, the executive actually did like the idea.
they just felt it wasn't taken far enough.
Mahsa, you're a very strong person,
and you've had very, very strong opinions
about all of the other project managers.
you were a project manager, and you lost.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm tremendously disappointed in myself.
I think I did a really good job at rallying the troops.
do you think you're weaker than you thought
when you walked into the task? Absolutely not.
I don't think that.
so you don't think this was a failure on your part?
no. I lost. It was a failure.
I was the project manager. I can take responsibility.
and, Liza, what I did find interesting
was the fact that you said Tyana was the weakest.
well, and the reason why I'm saying that is because -- why is that? So you obviously agree with Mahsa.
no, 'cause at the end of the day,
we finished shooting and we came back,
and that's what we have.
you know, you have what you have in your hand.
and we're trying to massage this thing.
you attack Liza all the time, Mahsa,
and yet she's defending you. Well,
I'm not really strictly defending her.
Liza, are you just afraid to go against Mahsa one-on-one?
no, I'm happy to go against Mahsa. If you defend her, will she go easy on you?
Yes. Yes. They're all afraid to go against her
everyone's not afraid!
why would they be afraid? She's not gonna beat them up.
aren't you a pit bull?
don't say you're tough. Don't say you're tough.
I'm not harsh the way she is. You know what the worst thing is?
I'm not harsh. Quiet. You know what the worst thing is?
people that say they're tough.
cause usually people that say they're tough
are the least tough.
okay? So don't say you're tough.
okay.
what do you have to say, Tyana?
I tried from the very beginning
to steer the team in the right direction.
I think the weakness was in the concept.
Tyana, you're railing against the concept,
but the executive liked the concept.
so where were you the rest of the time?
we understand you disagreed.
and to add to what ivanka said, it was not a slaughter.
no, no. It was very close.
he really just felt that you didn't take it quite far enough.
right.
and, Tyana, the fact
that every single member of the team wanted you fired,
don't you think that has to have an influence on me?
now, I like to think of myself as a total independent, all right?
and I do, too, mr. Trump.
but don't you think that when I go through
poppy and Brandy and everybody.
Liza, who, frankly, I don't even think she can like Mahsa
which I don't even understand why Liza is saying that. Liza said you should be fired.
Mr. Trump, you're the final decision.
Why? I can tell you that she thought you were on cruise control.
I was not on cruise control.
absolutely not.
she thought you were a critic.
you know, there's nothing I hate more than a critic,
I was not a critic.
Mr. Trump -- listen to me.
they knock, but they don't have any ideas themselves.
Mr. Trump -- the problem is,
you didn't have an idea yourself.
Tyana, you're fired.
go. Go.
thank you. Thank you, mr. Trump.
Hi.
it was not.
no.
she wasn't gonna be strong going forward, though. That was very tough.
Mr. Trump did not make the right decision.
mahsa should have been the one going home tonight.
but when the whole team turned against me, he had no choice.
I'm disappointed that my experience ended so soon,
but I feel I gave everything I could,
and I wouldn't change any of it.
rockport presents next steps.
since leaving "the apprentice" and working with the trumps,
I realized that I want to stay in the real-estate business.
I'm really good with people, and I'm really good in sales,
so why would I leave something that I'm good at?
so look me up, America.
let me be your real-estate agent.
rockport -- put your best foot forward.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considers these people irrelevant.
we don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
you won't believe what the Swede has been doing
going to the therapy.
how much does the therapist know?
are you resting comfortably?
Yes. But I should tell you that, I don't really believe in hypnotism.
the act of hypnosis is freewill.
for me to proceed, your mind must grant the permission.
will it work on me the first time?
most of my clients experience results in three to five sessions.
so we'll work on your anxiety and paranoia gradually.
see, Mr. Wren, hypnosis is merely relaxation combined with imagery.
you experience it every night as you drift asleep, focus on a book, or miss your exit on the FDR.
ready? - I think so, yes.
then let's begin. Please pick up the tablet beside you, and choose an image that speaks to your emotion.
Oh, this one.
I want you to close your eyes and form a mental picture of that image.
picture the birds, the field.
then one by one, picture them as they fly away.
focus on your breathing.
one bird departs. And as each one goes, your relaxation increases and you continue to feel calmer and more at rest.
for 200 bucks an hour, Finch,
I hope you get more than an expensive nap.
I want to take you back to a place in your life where you were safe and comfortable.
can you think of that place, Mr. Wren?
my childhood bedroom.
now, I want you to think of all the ways it made you feel safe.
picture it clear as day.
what color were the walls?
Hayden Price-- certified hypnotherapist to the Upper East Side.
does he do birthday parties?
it's not that kind of hypnotism, Mr. Reese.
he caters to wealthy businessmen and socialites.
anger management, smoking cessation, that sort of of thing.
or so you might think, if you didn't know that the office was rented on a short-term lease, and that his certification doesn't come from any association I can find.
during the therapy, I became attuned to the kind of questions that Hayden was asking.
a color that's favorable to you-- blue.
the name of a childhood pet-- Scout.
he was fishing--getting answers to your security questions.
my bank account was suddenly signed up for a recurring automatic donation to the nonprofit called "The American Cancer Coalition Fund.
I'd be willing the wager that Hayden's name is on that nonprofit.
so, unless he's moonlighting as a samaritan,
I'd say we're dealing with a con artist and a very clever thief.
so why'd you even play along, Finch?
I told Hayden what he wanted to hear.
I didn't even have a pet as a child.
but when I went to bluejack his phone, it was blocked.
someone had already jacked it, perhaps someone who's out to get him.
and his clients would be the best place to start.
I'll contact Shaw for back-up, but first I need to look in on our houseguest.
as before, Ms. Groves, Mr. Reese is upstairs with an unhealthy number of firearms. Please don't try to run.
honestly, Harold, locking me up?
I admit that the accommodations are not ideal.
but your confinement is for your own good.
Harold, your machine called me.
an event that I haven't fully reasoned out.
but your unpredictability, your willingness to hurt others make you as dangerous as ever.
you can't fight the future.
I'll bring you some new books.
I get it.
you wonder why it won't talk to you like it talks to me.
don't be jealous, Harold.
mom still loves us both.
when bluejacking Hayden didn't work,
I sent him a basket of pastries as a thank you.
bugged, of course.
I'm just so angry with her, I could kill her.
and those feelings will dissipate as you feel calmer, Mr. Sykes.
tell me about your mother.
speak her name, out loud-- her full name.
Mary Shackford Sykes. - Very good.
that's a start.
it seems therapy has helped, Sven.
I haven't been able to sleep this well in months.
and do you still believe you're surrounded by phonies?
sadly, yes. But thanks to you, I'm able to push past, to rediscover the quality and craft of my antique business, search for the meaning in my work.
sounds like Hayden isn't a half-bad therapist after all.
a lot of patients today? - Anybody weird? - Wall-to-wall mommy issues.
enough to make a man want to smoke.
or under-sleep or over-eat or
or?
who's the girl, Finch?
her name is Natalie Boal.
she works at an art gallery downtown.
she started coming to Hayden for therapy a little over a year ago.
it's more than therapy now.
Ugh, look at that. He isn't working her, he's in love.
and if she's making those eyes at him,
I bet she doesn't know about his criminal side.
someday, no more patients.
no more psychoses. No more snooty art buyers.
just you and me. We just go to the airport...
jet off to some corner of the world.
right. With what money, again?
let me worry about that.
and when I get enough, it's just you and me and paradise.
Hayden's on the move, Finch.
according to his schedule, he doesn't have any more appointments today.
so where is he going so fast?
there you go. - Thank you.
so, is everything in order? - Relax.
there's nothing to worry over.
the exchange rates are in your favor.
I started as a teller at that S&L, you know?
15 years I put in, and then they tell me I need to take a pay cut.
so I decided they owed me a pay raise.
here's my $50, 000, Mr. Russell.
Where's yours?
outstanding. Let's proceed.
I'm so gonna shoot this punk.
something's not right.
we're meeting your contact here?
it's quiet up here, and far from nosy thieves looking for cash.
no. The only thief here is you.
detective Decker, NYPD.
fraud investigation. Hands up, sucker.
sucker?
I can only guess what he got you for, pal.
and you, pass me that briefcase very slowly.
not today.
Oh, God.
Mr. Reese, Ms. Shaw, why aren't you intervening?
wait for it.
is he gone?
with his tail between his legs.
we really hooked that fish for 20 Gs? - Sure did.
20? I thought it was 50.
here's your half. Now let's get the hell out of here before somebody calls the real cops.
who isn't Hayden ripping off?
this guy's good.
I can watch you nursing that coffee for just so long.
you should know I called, to check in on you, Joss.
well, parking tickets and purse snatchers aren't exactly a challenge - after my old job, Mr. Quinn. - Alonzo, please.
the last time we met, you said you had suspicions about my godson's murder.
I tried working a few leads, but
Cal's department file was sealed.
there is a chance here that the organization HR could be involved.
I thought HR was disbanded. - The Feds just scattered the roaches.
it's sometimes hard to get 'em all.
maybe I can get the mayor involved, open doors for you at one pp.
I wouldn't wanna put you in that kind of position, Mr. Quinn.
I'll take my chances on this one solo.
all right.
I'm sorry, my shift is starting, and I have a rookie partner to pick up.
saddled you with a rookie, huh?
goes with the parking tickets and purse snatchers.
thanks for the coffee.
despite Hayden's criminality and his malfeasant theatrics,
I still think it's more likely that someone is out to get him than the other way around.
someone who bluejacked his phone.
maybe one of his clients is on to his scam.
Hayden may have conned any number of people, and all it takes is one easy mark with ties to a gang or organized crime, so we don't have a moment to waste.
if you and Ms. Shaw could visit some of his more irascible clients,
I'll text you their names and addresses on my way.
on your way to where? - Back to therapy.
Mr. Wren, when I snap my fingers, you will come totally out of your resting state feeling refreshed and relieved after our conversation.
so how did it go this time? - Quite well.
you're making very solid progress, Mr. Wren.
but sadly, our time is up for the day.
you really are very good at this, Mr. Price.
I'm so glad that I was referred to you. Where did you receive your training?
the Barringer Hypnosis Institute.
Oh, here in New York? - Of Tarzana, California.
I don't believe I know it.
what brought you all the way out here?
you know, I'm usually the one asking the questions, Mr. Wren.
who was it you said referred you to me again?
Oh, look at that. You're right.
our time is up for the day.
Hey, kid, come here.
Yes, sir.
Terney says you've been keeping an eye on Carter. - Yes, sir.
what does that mean?
well, we're having trouble with a money launderer.
guy messed up big. - But we need him to finish one morejob.
then you pull his card, dig a hole.
rest in peace.
who's the guy? The target?
come on, kid. We're taking a field trip.
and we're selling the soccer ball.
and I have your bid at $300, 000.
now 310, 000. 310, 000 right here.
320000
Hey, what are we doing here?
that's your guy.
his name is Sven.
he's an antique dealer down in the village.
we call him "the Swede."
so, what's your story? - You first.
I'm following an HR lead.
they wanna whack a Swedish antique dealer for screwing up their money laundering.
that's funny.
I'm on a con man therapist who happens to have a Swedish antique dealer as a patient.
I'll pretend that makes sense.
I think my con man might be after your Swede and his laundered money.
well, if that's HR's money, your con man is in for a world of hurt.
I'll stick with the con man, keep him out of trouble.
I'll stick with the antique dealer, see where he leads.
we are going once.
we are going twice.
fair warning on this 1911 Honus Wagner baseball card.
is sold, right here.
number 103 for $900, 000.
tomorrow, you're gonna punch that guy's ticket.
well, what do you know?
what's the Swede's therapist doing here?
Hey, Finch, we need to find out why everyone's so interested in the Swede.
so Hayden's patient is an antiques dealer, and he spent a million dollars on a baseball card?
and then tossed it into some cabinet like it was junk.
I watched him do it.
it's all very strange.
and what business does an antique dealer have laundering HR's money in the first place?
and why do they want him dead now?
turns out the Swede wasn't going to a real therapist.
he was spilling his guts to a con man.
I love that.
you know, that dinner was such a surprise.
I had a lovely time.
that's not the only surprise.
let's do it, Nat.
let's take our trip.
just go to the airport and pick our destination.
come with me?
Hayd, are you serious?
what about our-- our jobs, our lives?
they'll be here for us when we get back.
I wanna be impulsive.
I wanna whisk away the girl I love.
Yes. Of course.
when do we leave?
that's the other surprise.
now. No, tomorrow.
I need to do a few things.
pick you up in the AM?
I'll pack fast.
Finch, our con man's blowing the country fast.
something's up.
Oh, my God.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
who the hell are you?
the night watch.
who were these guys?
the cops-- the real cops.
what the hell is going on?
we were gonna ask you the same thing, Hayden.
I just spoke with Detective Carter.
she identified the badge numbers you gave me as HR. She's positive.
what's the deal, con man?
look. Someone just turned my office into Swiss cheese, and my girlfriend is waiting for me.
if she goes back to my place or to my office
I just spoke to Natalie a half an hour ago.
I explained to her how I was your new assistant and I needed to stash her in a motel until you'd visit her.
slight lie.
but nothing on a par with you, Hayden.
that's funny coming from you, Mr. Wren.
we know you've been scamming your patients, and we know you've had your eye especially on a Mr. Vanger, the antique dealer.
did you know he was a money launderer for HR?
I've heard of HR, but I swear, I didn't know the money was theirs.
who'd you think you were grifting?
sven came into my office a couple of months ago.
he was a chain smoker who had millions bouncing around in his accounts.
it would have been an easy score.
look what happened.
I didn't sign up for real bullets.
I'm done with this con and I'm out of here.
Where's Natalie? - Nice try. You're staying put.
what don't you get about "Done"?
look. You want me out of town?
I'm out of town.
but I can't go without her.
see, she's the only honest thing left about me.
I have to try and hold on to that.
detective, have you found out how the antique dealer is connected to HR's money laundering?
I'm meeting my source now.
you haven't touched your wine, Joss.
you're off duty. - I'm always on duty.
have you heard a word I said?
what do you think about the money being laundered?
I heard every word.
and the money's just HR's skim off the Russians.
a percentage kicked back to your friends in blue for turning a blind eye to the Yogorov business.
please, try the Brunello di Montalcino.
the finish is quite exquisite.
what I don't understand is what HR wants with an antique business.
clean money.
see, HR doesn't want blood-soaked bills from the Russians.
they want their cut in ones and zeroes, to transfer into their 401Ks, offshore accounts.
so, the antique dealer cycles the dirty Russian money into his own accounts and waits for instructions.
then he heads to the auction house, where he's told to bid on a certain high-priced item, an item auctioned off by a seller representing HR.
our next item up for bid is lot number 426
an extremely rare baseball signed by all of the 1927 New York Yankees, including Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth.
informally named,"Murderer's Row Ball."
I'd like to start the bidding at $2 million.
I got a bid for $2 million.
$4. 4 million. Where?
4. 4 in the front going once, twice.
sold right here,$4. 4 million. Thank you.
the Swede bids the highest, and all of that dirty money is deposited into HR's coffers, squeaky clean and laundered, and ready for digital distribution.
but I don't get it. They haven't laundered the money.
they've just bought an overpriced baseball.
all the items HR auctions off may have been appraised for millions of dollars, but they're really just fugazis, fakes, worthless junk.
so HR gets Russian money for nothing?
it's a perfect system, till someone on the outside knows about it.
so if your con man thinks he can just swoop in and take a piece of HR's business, he better watch his back.
who do you always meet in there? - None of your business.
Carter, I've been thinking.
that antique dealer, I can't just kill someone.
when I got involved with HR, I didn't think- No, you didn't think.
you just looked the other way.
I can't do that anymore.
and you're the only person I've got on my side right now. - I'm not on your side.
but I'm also not letting a homicide happen under my watch.
so, tomorrow, you're calling in sick.
I am? - Yeah, see you just got a new job.
tomorrow, you're Simmons's shadow.
wherever he goes, you go.
whoever he meets with, you get pictures of.
see, we just tapped into their piggy bank.
now I wanna know who's running the bank.
what is going on?
where have you been?
what-- Who is that creepy guy?
Natalie, I'm so sorry.
I get a call from someone at your office telling me to come to some hotel, - and then you don't even show up. - It's okay.
you need to take a breath. The more you breathe, the calmer you'll be. - No, no, no.
do not hypno-talk me.- I'm not hypno-talking you.
I'm saying, just be calm - I'm not one of your patients.
I know that, I know that.- You have to tell me
Finch, you ever notice how much of our job is like babysitting?
well, it's more than that today.
I don't think Hayden's told us the whole story of his con.
I'm going over Hayden's hard drive, what I downloaded of it before he zapped it.
and I'm finding emails addressed to Sven Vanger, the antique dealer.
Hayden may have elicited his email password while he was under hypnosis.
it appears that Hayden duplicated an email that Sven had received, but not yet read.
and he altered it in the process.
and what did the email say?
the email is from an anonymous address, regarding an auction that took place today.
in it, Vanger was instructed to bid on lot 424, but Hayden redrafted it, instructing him to bid on lot 426.
perhaps you should ask Hayden why.
he went out the window.
Finch, Hayden used his girlfriend and gave us all the slip.
I'm sorry. I'm about to close.
no, Sven, you're already closed.
who are you with, the Russians or the police?
I have nothing left for you. - I'm not with either.
but I do need something-- answers.
I'm not your doormat.
why don't you drop that before you hurt yourself, Sven?
give it to me.
why is it every time you call me these days, I know to bring a firearm?
but he was such a good therapist.
Hey, Dragon Tattoo, he's also a con man who stole from you.
not stealing from me, stealing from them.
he should not be doing that.
how'd you even get into this mess?
seven months ago, I got in trouble with the customs here in New York.
a cop named Simmons came and said he could make the charges go away if I helped them launder cash for a few Russian associates of theirs.
at first, it was just a few hundred thousand each month.
then it became more and more-- millions.
I got rid of the last cash today.
on lot 426?
how did you know about that? - Hayden played you.
he switched out your emails, and made you bid on the wrong item today.
then what did I purchase?
a real ball, signed by the real 1927 Yankees, really worth 4. 4 million.
that was a hell of a season.
Where's the ball, Sven?
it's gone. I sold it for $5.
they're going to kill me.
I gotta get out of this city immediately!
too late. You're a marked man.
close your eyes. This stuff burns.
so we're faking crime scenes now?
a long way from your days back at the Eighth.
might wanna spread it out.
arterial spray is more erratic. - Will you let me work?
going for a kind of a hollow-point special kind of motif.
there. - Congratulations.
you've just died and been reborn.
now, take your new life, and get the hell out of New York.
yeah? - Hey, rookie, I need you to hold off on the antique dealer.
something went wrong at the auction house. We didn't get our money.
sir, there's a small problem.
just heard from my source in HR,
Simmons knows they get ripped off.
all this baseball stuff, you should've called me in sooner.
I'm kind of a Mets fan, though.
somewhere in the city, your soda kid's walking around with a zillion-dollar baseball in his pocket.
with HR looking for the ball.
and the young man has no idea.
let's hope he don't play catch.
Hey, kiddo, you got something for me?
I can't believe Hayden would use his own girlfriend as an excuse to escape.
I can. A baseball worth 4 million would be a motivational force.
Oh, he doesn't care who he steps on to get away with it either.
exactly. He still has to get away, but he won't go without Natalie.
as you and I well know, sometimes necessity and desire can conflict.
Hayden's still in the city.
he's too smart to use his own phone.
so how do we track him?
we don't. We track Natalie.
Hayden's calling her right now.
Nat, please, I'm sorry.
I've done things that I'm not proud of, but I love you.
can you trust me on that? - I wanna know what's going on right now.
that's a little complicated, Nat.
wait. Where are you? - I'm going home.
did you think I was just gonna sit in that hotel room after you went out the window?
no, honey, you can't go there. It's not safe for you. - Really?
how would I even know?
look, Hayden, I love you.
but I deserve the truth, or else I'm done.
I'm a criminal and a thief.
but I'm done with that life.
I secured a score that will ensure our future.
the kind of score that would let us pick our destination.
if you meet me outside my old office in one hour, then we can fly to any corner of the world, like we planned.
and I'll tell you everything.
stop loving me or even hate me, but please hear me out.
I'll be there.
I didn't wanna worry you.
I'm cleanin' up this mess.
you say the Swede bought the baseball?
that's what the logs at the auction house said.
but without him, it's gonna be a little tough to track him.
that idiot bought a real autographed ballworth $4. 4 million, and we had a rookie kill him before we found out what he did with it?
maybe the rookie should be handling your end of things.
at least he follows through.
but you said there was a con man involved.
Yeah. - Find him.
shake him till the damn ball falls out.
and tell me you have at least one lead.
when we tapped his phone, we found out about the con man's little girlfriend.
it seems the guy's in love.
he ain't going anywhere without her.
make it right, Simmons.
I got two loves-- my money and this city.
mess with either, I mess right back.
Hey, lover boy.
What'd you expect? I'm a crook.
he's my expert.
what, you don't trust me? - Like you said, you're a crook.
I don't know about expert, but it looks pretty damn real.
I have a buyer lined up.
I'll split it with you, 50/50.
60/40? - Not a half bad deal, huh?
will you at least let me call Natalie before you kill me or arrest me or put me in a well in your basement?
you have 30 seconds.
sorry to disappoint, con man.
seems the NYPD isn't bad at phone traces.
I found your girl in 20 minutes.
I'll give you the ball. It's yours. - Don't be noble.
there's only criminals on this line.
but I'll take the ball, just the same.
you meet me in front of the auction house in 20 minutes.
how bad is it? - They'll kill her.
these people, for this much money?
so what are you gonna do to stop them?
I'm scum. I get it.
but Natalie
my ultimate con, my final trick was gonna be actually turning into the guy that she fell in love with.
I'll give it all away to save her life.
will you help me?
this is how it goes.
rookie stays outside with the girl.
Terney, take the con man inside, verify the ball is real.
I'm not taking any more chances with this clown.
why do I have to go inside?
because that's what you were just told.
once we confirm the ball is the real deal,
Laskey takes the girl, puts a double tap in her head.
questions?
boss, uh, she doesn't know anything.
why don't we just let her go?
do I look like I'm taking suggestions from rookies today?
no, sir.
the ball? - The girl.
I wanna talk to Natalie.
you're going inside first.
one thing you can trust about a thief is he'll always be a thief.
I'm so sorry.
call me when there's money and bodies.
you were right, Carter.
they would never let her go.
make it look good.
remember, the aim shouldn't be to hurt him, just incapacitate him a little.
also, watch your knuckles.
I've punched a lot of guys.
so have I.
let's get you to safety.
we've been through this already, it's real.
you think I'd be standing here if it wasn't?
we'll see.
I'll know in a minute.
I need a microscope to know for sure, but the texture appears accurate.
there is, however, a problem.
what?
see this? Babe Ruth's signature?
Yeah. What about it?
it's in felt-tip pen.
those didn't exist when Babe Ruth was alive.
this ball is a fake.
you give us a fake? You give us a fake?
you wanna die? - I swear, that is the real ball.
the real ball costs $4 million.
the fake is just gonna cost you a bullet, con man.
why would I lie?
you have to believe me.
we can figure this out.
where is the real ball?
so where's the real ball?
I have no idea. I thought this was the real ball.
forget that. Where's Natalie?
I put her in a cab, told her to go somewhere safe.
this is Natalie. - Nat, where are you?
are you okay?
Oh, I'm better than okay.
you see, that antique dealer
sven was his name-- well, he may have been your big score, but you were my big whale, from the moment I met you.
you-- you played me?
why steal millions from criminals when you can date the thief and take it off him?
keep the change.
of course, things did get a little hairy with those corrupt cops, but you always did know how to show a girl a good time, Hayden.
where will you go?
Oh, go find an airport, maybe just pick a destination.
isn't that the dream come true?
you know, I really did love you.
well, if you love something, set it free.
I'm ruined.
maybe it's time you went on the straight and narrow.
you'll live longer.
I hear hypnotherapists are in pretty high demand these days.
you know, I do have a thriving practice to rebuild.
I'm gonna need a new office with a few less bullet holes.
my advice?
rebuild in another city.
detective Terney, I can't help but notice you're not carrying a ball.
the ball the con man brought was a fake.
the guy with the suit showed up, rolled Laskey and our guys, and then got away with the con man and his girl.
do you have any idea what's at stake here?
you go find that screw-up Laskey and you scour this city until you find that ball.
Simmons, I'm not the rookie. Don't talk to me like one.
if you don't find that ball, then it's gonna be a $4 million funeral for the both of you.
now go.
I was just turning out the lights for the evening,
ms. Groves, and I remembered that I had promised to bring you some new reading material.
a peace offering, Harold?
is that what you've brought?
I really think if you could just see things my way, and not consider this- Imprisonment?
is there any other way to consider it?
this truly is for your own good, Ms. Groves.
this synchronistic relationship that you've developed with the machine, it can't be
I worry about you.
you've misunderstood the situation.
you shouldn't worry about me.
I'm worried about you, Harold.
you can't stop what's coming, and neither can I.
but we have the opportunity to understand things when they finally change.
the future is coming.
you started it...
and I'll finish it.
you missed me. Leave a message.
Laskey, I'm outside your place. We have a lot of work to do. Come on.
I stuck to the guy like glue.
this is everyone Simmons met with.
Thanks, kid, you did all right.
but you should know, it'll get harder out there.
after these last few days, things are gonna heat up.
so you need to be prepared.
Oh. When I got involved with HR,
I thought it was about loyalty.
I was wrong.
it's about murder and greed.
well, ain't that cozy.
I should've known she'd turn you, rookie.
the first time I saw you, I knew you were weak.
so let me tell you how the world works now, kid.
we kill her or they kill us.
that decision is gonna be your last, Terney.
No!
that much blood, and you'll be dead in a minute, maybe two.
make 'em count.
who do you and Simmons report to?
who calls the shots?
is the answer in these pictures, huh?
last chance, Terney! Be a cop!
Prof: Good morning everyone.
Augustus founded the Julio-Claudian dynasty.
the Claudian for the Claudian side of the family.
that was Augustus' wife from--her side of the family, excuse me, the Claudian side of the family.
and there were four emperors in the Julio-Claudian dynasty.
these were Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero.
every one of them, all four, made an important contribution to the evolution of Roman architecture, and we'll talk about the contributions of those four today.
but we'll also see that the single most important contribution, from the standpoint of Roman architecture, was by Nero, the notorious emperor Nero, which is why I do call this lecture "Notorious Nero and His Amazing Architectural Legacy.
an architectural legacy that would have been impossible without some of the earlier concrete constructions that we've already discussed, specifically the frigidaria of Pompeii and also the thermal bath at Baia, which I remind you of here.
the so-called Temple of Mercury, we see it again with its dome made out of concrete construction, a view from the exterior.
and down here, at the left, a view of the interior of the monument, and I remind you of the way in which is that designed so that light streams through the oculus in the dome, down onto the sides of the wall, creating light effects:
a circle that corresponds to the shape of the opening above, and then falling initially on the pool of water that would have been located there, as well as across the walls, which probably would have been-- that were certainly stuccoed over
and probably would have been covered with mosaic.
so a very spectacular interior indeed, and one again that had an important impact, as we'll see, on the architectural designs of the Roman emperor Nero.
I want to begin though with the first of the Julio-Claudian emperors, and that is with Tiberius.
and you see a portrait of Tiberius now on the screen, just to give you a sense of what he looked like.
Tiberius, again the son of Livia by a former marriage, the elder son of Livia by a former marriage, who becomes emperor of Rome right after Augustus.
and the portrait that you see here is a marble portrait of Tiberius that is now in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptothek in Copenhagen.
Tiberius was emperor of Rome from 14 to 37 A. D. and with regard to architecture, he completed projects begun by Augustus.
he also was responsible for restoring Republican buildings that had fallen into severe disrepair by his reign, and this included several temples, a basilica, warehouses, and also a theater.
Tiberius also initiated some new building projects in Rome.
these included a Temple to the Divine Augustus, Temple to Divus Augustus, his divine adoptive father, because Augustus was made a god, as Caesar had been before him, at his death.
Tiberius also put up a series of arches to his relatives, and also a camp for the Praetorian Guard.
but what we'll see about Tiberius is that his real passion was not the public architecture that Augustus had been so fond of
think the Forum of Augustus and the Temple of Mars Ultor, or the Ara Pacis Augustae, which were among Augustus' most important building projects.
Tiberius was interested instead in private architecture
architecture in a sense for himself and his nearest and dearest
and he began a palace on the Palatine Hill.
he did not think the small, modest House of Augustus, despite the fact that it had those nicely painted walls, he did not think that that befit his own grandeur, and he began a major palace on the Palatine Hill on the northwest side of the Palatine Hill.
and he renovated and built villas elsewhere, outside of Rome especially on the spectacular Island of Capri.
and indeed, during the reign of Augustus, and also the reign of Tiberius, that family, the Augustan and Julio-Claudian family, built twelve villas--count them, twelve villas
on the Island of Capri, one more spectacular than the next.
it's worth mentioning, by the way, that Augustus' taste, even in villas, was somewhat more modest than Tiberius.
Augustus used to decorate his villa, we are told, with dinosaur bones and things like that, of historical interest whereas Tiberius spared no expense in introducing every luxury possible into his villas.
with regard to the palace on the Palatine Hill, the so-called Domus Tiberiana, I just want to mention it in passing.
there's very little that survives of the substructures that Tiberius was responsible for beginning, for that palace.
they were made out of concrete construction, and you can see here what's called the Clivus Palatinus, which is a ramp way leading from the Roman Forum, up to the Palatine Hill.
and you can see some of the remains of those substructures over here.
the ones that we see were probably restored later and may or may not date to the Tiberian period, but they give you some idea of the sort of construction that he began on the Palatine Hill.
and I mention this just because we'll see that Caligula and some of the other emperors continued to add to this palace, and then the entire Palatine Hill is redesigned by the emperor Domitian in the late first century A. D.
much more interesting and much more--and there's much more information for us to look at
are the villas on the island of Capri.
and I'm going to show you one, the best preserved, from that island, the so-called Villa Jovis:
the Villa Jovis, the Villa of Jupiter, which is an interesting name, when you think about it, for a villa for the emperor Tiberius.
the Villa Jovis, which was put up sometime in the years in which Tiberius was emperor; that is, from 14 to 37 A. D.
it's a spectacular place, beautifully situated.
and I'm going to take you there today.
now the only way to get to the island of Capri, which by the way is one of my very favorite places in the world;
I don't know how many of you've been there, but it's quite extraordinary--the island of Capri.
you can't jet to the Island of Capri, you have to arrive there by boat, and most people take a boat, unless they have a private yacht, but those of us who don't, have to take a boat either from Naples, usually a hydrofoil although they have larger boats as well
a hydrofoil from Naples or from Positano.
and I actually show you--this is a view on the left-hand side of the screen of Positano on the Amalfi Coast.
you go down to the beach; there's a place where you can pick up a hydrofoil.
it takes a very short time, half an hour or so, less, a little bit less, to get over to the Island of Capri from Positano.
so we're sitting on one of those hydrofoils
or at least eight of us are, because that's usually what they fit
and we're making our way from Positano toward Capri.
as you go there, if the weather is good enough, and if the sea is calm enough, they will take you to see the famous grottos, the Green Grotto and also the Blue Grotto.
and again I can just give you a little sense here of--in this view--of how blue is blue.
I mean, it's really a neon blue, when you go to see the Blue Grotto.
it's a spectacular sight and a very special color blue that you really don't see anywhere else in the world.
so they'll drive you around in the hydrofoil to see the grottos, and then you eventually get to the dock at Capri, and this is what you see as you get off the boat at the island of Capri:
again a very beautiful spot to visit.
as you go up, you make your way from the dock up to the funicular.
you take the funicular up to the main part of town, and one of the first things you see is the popular Bar Tiberio.
I show it to you, not to--it's a fun place to go
but I show it to you mainly because it's one of these examples of the way in which the Roman emperors have had a lasting impact, even today, that so many of these bars and restaurants and so on are named for Rome's emperors, or for some of the monuments that we've been studying in the course of this semester.
and this bar is no exception, and in fact if you go through the doors that lead into the interior of the bar, you will see a portrait of Tiberius etched on the doorway.
so Tiberius very much lives and thrives in the center of downtown Capri still today.
what most tourists go to Capri to see, besides just to walk around a magnificent island and to test out some of the beaches, which tend to be on the rocky side, is to see the most famous rocks of Capri.
and these are the so-called Faraglioni. You see them here.
you go up to the so-called Gardens of Augustus, and then up to a spot where you can see these particularly well.
they're magnificent.
they are the landmark spot on the island of Capri, and they have survived coastal landslides and sea erosion, to look as wonderful as they still do today.
and this is, of course, the photo op on the island.
I don't think there's anyone who visits Capri who doesn't take a photo or have a photo taken of themselves at the Faraglioni.
the villa that I want to show you is again the best preserved villa of Tiberius on Capri.
and again I mentioned that it's called the Villa Jovis, and it dates to 14 to 37 A. D.
it's a trek to get up there. You have to walk essentially.
the streets are such that there are no cabs or cars that can get you there.
you have to make it on your own. And there are two paths.
I've made the mistake of taking the more arduous path, which looks like this, to get up to the top, but there's another path also that takes you by some very attractive houses and villas, which are fun to see.
and you will see the largest lemons
has anyone ever been on the island of Capri?
you'll see the largest lemons on Capri, as well as on the Amalfi Coast in general, that you've ever seen anywhere:
gigantic lemons on lemon trees, as you make your way up to the Villa of the Villa Jovis.
now here is a plan of the Villa Jovis, as well as a cross-section, from the Ward-Perkins textbook.
and if we look first at the cross-section, at the uppermost part of the screen, you will see the way this building was made.
you will see that the architects have taken advantage of developments in concrete construction to create a series of barrel vaults in tiers, and those barrel vaults in tiers are where-- are the cisterns of the villa, where the water was kept to supply the baths and the kitchen and so on, of the villa.
you see those there, and in this plan down here you can see the cisterns again and the way in which a pavement has been placed on top of those tiers of barrel vaults, to create a very large court here.
the entranceway into Tiberius' villa on Capri was over here.
you can see a series of columns, four in total, that you see as you make your way into the entranceway of the villa.
along this side of the villa, which is the southern side of the villa, you see the baths--not surprisingly placed on the southern side
extensive bath structure for the emperor.
on the western side you see a series of rooms that are for the entourage of Tiberius.
the kitchen is located on this side as well.
and then perhaps the most important room of the house, from our standpoint, the hall or the aula--a-u-l-a--the aula of Tiberius' villa at Capri.
and you can see the shape of that aula.
it's a kind of hemicycle with large picture windows that allow views that lie outside.
and it should remind you of the second phase of the Villa of the Mysteries in Pompeii, where we also saw that attractive bay window with the panoramic views, out beyond.
the panoramic views were much more spectacular here than even from the Villa of the Mysteries, because as I think you can see also from this site plan, that this is located right at the edge of a promontory.
it's in fact 1, 095 feet above sea level, and you get some incredible views of the sea and of other islands from this location.
on this side, the northern side of the structure, is where the apartments of Tiberius were located;
a series of rooms for the emperor himself, and including also an imperial loggia, where he could walk out and get some attractive panoramas privately on his own.
you can also see that there is a corridor that leads from the private apartment to this very long walkway, that is located right at the edge of the cliff on this side.
this is called technically an ambulatio --a-m-b-u-l-a-t-i-o, an ambulatio--and it was just for that.
it was for taking pleasant walks, getting nice views of the sea from there, especially for the emperor and special invited guests.
and right in the center was a triclinium--you see it right here--a triclinium or dining room where the emperor could dine and could look out again over views that were possible from this particular locale.
this is a view unfortunately in black and white, but it's the only one that I have that gives you a sense of the remains today from above, the extent of those remains.
and you can see again the concrete construction I think quite well from this, as well as the fact that although all the foundation walls are there, there's no decoration, the ceilings are missing, and so on and so forth.
you see the cistern here, the location of the aula up here, the area for the entourage of Tiberius, and the private apartment on that side.
a church and a statue on a base were added later, and so of course you need to think those away.
this is a view of some of the remains as they look today, just to give you a sense that when you're actually up there and wandering around.
the walls don't go up all that far, but you can also see that they do preserve the entire plan of the structure, which is why we have such a good idea of what it looked like in antiquity and how all of those pieces fit together.
you can see that the construction is concrete and the facing is stone, irregular stonework, the kind of opus incertum work that we've seen elsewhere in Campania.
because remember this is an island, but it's off the coast of Naples, Pompeii and Oplontis;
it is in that same general area of Italy.
and this is one view and one--I have many more spectacular ones than this one
but this is one that gives you a sense of the sort of thing you can see.
this one I took right from, I think from near the aula;
just to give you an idea of what you see from there.
beautiful views of the sea.
in some areas you can see the rocky outcroppings as you look down, and then views of some other islands in the area, for example Ischia, and so on.
the successor to Tiberius was a man by the name of Caligula.
Caligula became emperor at the death of Tiberius.
and we see a portrait of him here, on the right-hand side of the screen, just again to give you a sense of the man.
he had a very short--he was very young when he became emperor of Rome--he had a very short reign, only three years.
and he was somewhat unbalanced, and it was not long after he became emperor
Oh, by the way, he was very popular when he was a boy;
he was a prince, very popular.
he used to run around the military camps with his family, in a little military costume, and he wore these distinctive military boots called the caliga, c-a-l-i-g-a;
which is how he got the nickname Caligula, from those boots.
he was extremely popular with everyone, and everyone was quite excited when he became emperor of Rome.
but his power went to his head.
he became a despot, and he spent most of his time cavorting with his three sisters.
I show you them here on a coin, and they're all named:
Agrippina, Julia, and--Drusilla was his favorite, so of course she's in the center there-- Drusilla.
and he also did strange things like conduct faux wars essentially, faux wars with faux enemies:
for example, his war against Britain, so to speak.
and he also spent a good deal of time trying to work it out so that his horse, Incitatus, could become a senator.
so this gives you some idea of the kind of man we're dealing with here.
he was occupied with all of that and really not that much with architecture.
and again, he was only emperor for a very short time, so there was a limit to what kinds of architectural contributions he could make.
but he didn't make none.
I mean, he made some, and in fact one of them is particularly important, and I want to emphasize those to you here.
so again, Caligula was emperor between 37 and 41 A. D.
he had little public building.
again, he continued the tradition of Tiberius, and that is in having much more interest in private villa architecture than in public architecture.
but again it's only fair--as we judge him in terms of his architectural contribution,
I think it's only fair to remind ourselves that again he was only emperor for three years.
if he had been emperor longer, perhaps his contribution would have been greater.
he did finish several buildings, begun by Tiberius
and we're going to see this as a pattern, that is, emperors coming to the fore and completing buildings by their predecessors.
and he did build a couple of new things, including two new aqueducts and a circus located near what is now Vatican City.
he thought the Domus Tiberiana was a terrific idea and consequently he added to that palace;
that's the palace that Tiberius began on the slopes of the Palatine Hill.
but his main interest was villas outside Rome.
he built a number of those.
I'm not talking about Capri now, those were already built, and he could go down and enjoy those as emperor of Rome, but he wanted to ring Rome with a series of villas, and he began that work.
and later on, according to Pliny the Elder,
Rome was ringed with the villas, not only of Caligula, but also of Nero.
so these were going up apace around the city of Rome itself.
the single most important contribution though that Caligula made, and it is very significant, is to alter-- it was during his reign, during his brief reign, that the recipe for Roman concrete construction was altered.
what they did was make the decision to lighten it up, and they did that by taking the stone rubble that had been used in the mixture of concrete for some time, taking that stone rubble and dispensing with it, getting rid of it, because it was too heavy, and mixed the liquid mortar instead with a very porous, yellow tufa, and also with pumice, which is a soft light stone resembling cork.
so when you think of replacing heavy rubble with something that resembles cork, you get the sense that that is going to lead to lighter domes;
lighter domes are going to lead to domes that are able to span greater spaces.
so this is no small accomplishment. This is very, very significant.
it happens during the reign of Caligula, and we'll see already today that the so-called Golden House or Domus Aurea of Nero, would not have been possible, the span of that dome would not have been possible without this change in the recipe in concrete that happened under Caligula.
the other development under Caligula that I want to make reference to really has more to do with religious practice, but it also has an important impact on architecture, and that is the impact of mystery cults on Roman religion.
I think I've mentioned to you already that the Romans practiced a state religion, and that state religion was considered the religion that everyone should adhere to.
but over time, because of Rome's connections to other parts of the empire, especially the Eastern Empire, a whole host of different kinds of religions, mystery religions, exotic religions, began to infiltrate Rome.
they came back through the army, they came back through commerce, to Rome.
and initially they were not accepted.
you were not allowed to practice these openly.
and so we saw an example with the Villa of the Mysteries where the woman of the house created a special room, room number five, for the celebration of the cult of Dionysus, because that was considered a secret religion at that particular point.
but these mystery religions, Caligula himself showed some interest in them, and it began to look as if perhaps they would be able to begin to come up from underground.
they didn't during his reign, but I think again his contribution in that way was also an important one.
they did continue to have to meet in secret.
and one sect in particular I want to make reference to today, the so-called Neo-Pythagorean sect, because we'll see in the next monument that I want to show you, that it was that sect that was celebrated in a very interesting underground basilica that I want to turn to now.
it doesn't date to the time of Caligula;
in fact, it's a little bit later, in the reign of Claudius.
but I want to show it to you here, because again it was Caligula's beginning to be more accepting of these kinds of things that led in part to their proliferation, initially underground and then above ground as well.
this is the so-called Underground Basilica, because it is located underground.
it dates to around A. D. 50.
and you can see from this site plan its location.
you can see it marked "basilica" up there, and you can see that it's near a street we've already talked about, the Via Praenestina in Rome, which you'll remember is one, along with the Via Labicana, that came and converged on the Tomb of the Baker that we looked at last time.
in fact, if you look at this site plan, you see the trapezoidal plan of the Tomb of the Baker right here.
and when we discussed the Tomb of the Baker,
I made the point to you that it was located, or it was sited, in front of a great gate, the so-called Porta Maggiore, or the great gate that spanned two aqueducts.
and I said to you, I urged you to think away that great gate because it was built later.
it was built, in fact, during the reign of Claudius.
we're going to look at it momentarily.
so you see the great gate here, and you see the Tomb of the Baker, and that gives you a sense of the location of the basilica, the Underground Basilica of 50 A. D.
if you look at that basilica, you see the plan is exactly like the basilica in a civic context
the basilica at Pompeii, for example--with a central nave and two side aisles, divided by that nave, that central space, through architectural members, in this case through piers rather than columns;
and then at the end, to give some emphasis to one short side of the space, an apse, that you also see there.
this underground basilica was used for religious worship.
so we see once again what I've referred to as the interchangeability of form:
the idea of creating a certain building plan for a civic center, the law court or basilica, and then using it in other ways.
we already saw the basilican plan being used in house design at Herculaneum as a banqueting hall, and here we see it as a religious, a place for religious worship underground:
a basilican form being used for religious worship underground.
the Underground Basilica is miraculously preserved. Why?
because it's underground and it didn't--it consequently was kept in very good shape over time.
it's very difficult to get permission to go down and see it, but it is a marvel, as you can see from this image here.
how did they create this Underground Basilica?
how did they make this building underground?
well they cut trenches in the tufa rock, in the tufa rock;
remember we've talked about how ubiquitous tufa rock was in Rome, both on the hillsides, like the Palatine, and elsewhere.
so they cut trenches in the tufa rock, and then they poured concrete into those trenches to create the walls and also the barrel vault that you see so well here.
and once that concrete had dried, they cut it out in such a way as to create the piers that you also see very well in this structure.
so we're looking at that central space;
we're looking at the piers, the arches above those piers, and then that's supporting a barrel vaulting ceiling, as well as a semi-vault in the apse of this structure.
another view gives you a sense of the relationship of the central space to the aisles.
it's a fairly small structure but nonetheless it is quite light and airy, as I think you can see here, as we look from the central nave toward one of the side aisles.
you can see the piers and the arches above those piers, and you can also see the way in which the walls are decorated.
they're made out of concrete but they're stuccoed over and divided into a series of panels that are decorated with pretty strong resemblance to Third Style, and that resemblance becomes even clearer as we look up to the vault above.
this is how we surmise that this building was put up to the Neo-Pythagorean cult, because of the figures that we see floating in the central panels here.
those who have a good understanding of the Neo-Pythagorean cult have suggested that these track extremely well the beliefs of this particular cult.
but interesting for us is again the close resemblance of this to Third Style Roman wall painting.
it's done in stucco.
the stucco is painted, but you can see it's divided into a series of panels with floating mythological figures, or floating religious figures in this case, inside the panels.
and look then very carefully at some of the floral decorations, which you will see also resemble very closely the flimsy candelabra and so on that are characteristic of Third Style Roman painting.
this shouldn't surprise you. The date of 50 A. D. is still well within the Third Style.
we've talked about the very long life of the Third Style, that it was used already in the late first century B. C. but that it didn't really go out until about 62 A. D.
so 50 was still in that period of the Third Style;
it doesn't surprise us to see decoration like this, in this very interesting Underground Basilica.
Caligula was murdered in 41, and his wife and daughter--he had one daughter--were also murdered at the same time.
he had no family member to succeed him, and his uncle Claudius was chosen as the next emperor of Rome.
many of you may know the interesting story, quite captivating story, of how Claudius was chosen as emperor.
he was someone who was not highly respected by his family--and I'll say more about that in a moment;
no one ever thought he was going to amount to anything.
and when, after Caligula's death, Claudius was such, kind of timid, that he hid behind a curtain.
but as the Praetorian Guard wandered through the palace, trying to figure out who in the world they were going to appoint as Caligula's successor, they saw a pair of feet underneath a curtain.
they pulled open that curtain and they saw Claudius, and they thought, "Well he's going to be no trouble at all.
no one thinks much of him.
we're going to be able to get everything we want if we appoint Claudius as emperor.
and so they did, they bowed down, and they said, "You are now--," or they put him up on their shoulders,"You are now emperor of Rome.
well Claudius surprised them because he was a very smart individual indeed, as we shall see.
this is a cameo, a famous cameo that represents Claudius, just for you to get some sense of what he looked like, over here on the left, with his wife, and then possibly--these two figures over here are controversial
possibly with Tiberius or some other member of the imperial family.
this is blown up into colossal size.
it's a fairly small but very beautiful cameo, and these cameos were used as presentation pieces in ancient Roman times.
Claudius was emperor of Rome between A. D. 41 and 54.
I mentioned that his family did not have much respect for him.
they thought he was weak and sickly, and they thought he was dim-witted.
and the only reason they thought he was dim-witted, because the poor fellow stammered, and they thought that that reflected an undisciplined mind.
not at all, he was very, very intelligent indeed, and he surprised them.
he surprised not only the Praetorian Guard but also his family, when he became emperor.
he turned out to be a unique individual with a predilection, as we shall see, for an entirely new kind of, and very distinctive form of architecture, and one that I believe--and I'll try to make the case to you today-- reflected his very distinctive intellect.
we need to know therefore something about him and how he came
how he had trained himself intellectually before he became emperor of Rome.
he was fifty-years-old when he became emperor.
he had been, in the years prior to that, a scholar, an historian, an antiquarian, a linguist.
he wrote a history of Rome by himself--it was not ghostwritten--and he wrote several volumes, also on his own, on the Etruscans; he was particularly interested in the Etruscans.
we know he added a few letters to the Latin alphabet to give it more range, and he was the last Roman, as far as we know, to be able to read and also write Etruscan.
this gives you a very good sense of the man.
with regard to architecture, he rejected categorically the interests of Tiberius and Caligula in villa architecture, and he returned to the construction of public architecture
he looked to Augustus as a model for this-- and especially to public works.
let me show you one example.
you see on the screen a site plan of the port of Rome.
I've already mentioned the fact that the port of Rome was located at Ostia,
ostia the city at the mouth of the Tiber River.
we saw the plan of Ostia, a colony already founded in the mid-fourth century B. C. in around 350, and it grew over time and it had its efflorescence, as we'll see in a later lecture, in the second century A. D.
here the plan of Ostia over here.
the Tiber River, and then at the mouth of the Tiber River, at a place that we call Portus, a location that we call Portus or Porto-- it's on the Monument List for you--the actual harbor itself.
what we're looking at above is a coin of the emperor Nero.
you see Nero on the obverse and on the reverse a representation of what we think is the port built by Claudius.
we have a description of the port of Claudius by Suetonius in his Lives.
Suetonius tells us that the port had curving breakwaters, curving breakwaters.
and if we look at this coin of Nero that was struck by the emperor between 64 and 68 A. D. we see on the back what is clearly a port, with curving breakwaters.
so we believe that this must be a depiction of the port built by Claudius sometime during his reign, that is, between 41 and 54.
what does that coin tell us about what that port must have looked like?
we can see that there is a large statue in the upper center.
there is a river god reclining below, probably the Tiber himself, to locate this port, and also a series of boats in the center.
but most important again are the curving breakwaters, which you can see are made up of a series of columns;
they look like colonnades, one on either side, curving colonnades.
this plan down here shows us the likely plan of the Claudian harbor, roughly circular, again with breakwaters on either side, with columns on either side.
this area was added to by the emperor Trajan, in the early second century A. D.
he added a five-sided port as well, and you can see that here, in this plan as well.
but think that away for now.
all that would've been there was Claudius' port with the curving breakwaters.
this is a painting of both of those ports, that's on the wall in the Vatican.
I've walked by it many times and only recently really noticed it and took a picture of it, and I think it'll be helpful to you today because it gives you a sense of what this port looked like in antiquity.
we see the later port of Trajan over here.
but again think that away for now and concentrate on the curving breakwaters of Claudius' port.
you see here this colossal statue, possibly of Neptune, over here, a lighthouse, over here, and the boats in the center of this.
but most important for us again are those curving breakwaters and the fact that they were made up of columns.
the columns are all that survive today, and what a set of columns they are.
I show a detail of some of them to you here.
and you should be struck by these columns, because these are columns unlike any other columns that we have seen in the course of this semester.
if you look at these columns very carefully, you will see that the capitals on the top, which are very severe--they're not exactly the Doric order but they resemble the Doric order-- very severe, and they are finished; you can identify them as capitals.
and the bases, I'll show you a view of the bases in a moment, the bases, as we'll also see, are also finished with very nice moldings down below.
but in between the bases and the capitals, we see something again that we've never seen before, and that is a series of drums, of column drums, piled one on top of another.
but those drums are not finished, or they're left in a rough state -- one or the other.
they have either been deliberately left in a rough or rusticated state, or they were unfinished.
why might they have been unfinished?
they might have been unfinished because the project was late, they were rushing it, they wanted to get it done, they needed to use the harbor, and so they said, "Look, to save time just put those columns up the way they are and don't bother finishing the drums of the column.
or one could argue that it might have had to do with expense, that it was getting too expensive, and that they decided not to finish the drums for that reason.
or it might have been deliberate, or it might have been deliberate:
the idea to leave those drums rough, to make them look rusticated.
I'm going to make a case today that it's the last, that this was a deliberate move on Claudius and his architects.
and one of the main reasons I can make that
if this is all we had, if we had only this port of Claudius, only these columns in this style, it would be very difficult to make the case.
but as we're going to see, when we move from this to that great gate, or the Porta Maggiore, which was put up under Claudius, and then not today but next time, to a building that was put up in Claudius' honor after his death, we will see that all three of those have these rusticated columns or piers in common, which suggests to us
it suggests to me for sure-- that these are--that leaving was deliberate on the part of the patron and his architects.
and I'm also going to suggest that it had to do with Claudius'peculiar personality, and especially his interest in antiquarianism, in the past, in the history of Rome, and the history of the Etruscans, and so on.
here's another detail of one of the columns over here, where you can see the rough drum, and then down below the base on which that sits, a molded base, very carefully molded.
the architects, the designers, the artisans could finish these columns perfectly well if they chose to.
they did it on the base, they did it in the capitals, but not in between.
here's another one where you can see a series of columns engaged into a wall, and again you can see the rough or rusticated drums.
then down below the molded and finished bases.
so this difference between what we call finished masonry or dressed-- d-r-e-s-s-e-d--dressed masonry, or rusticated masonry: masonry that is deliberately left rough.
again, in order to underscore this point,
I want to turn now to the great gate or the Porta Maggiore in Rome, also built by Claudius between 41 and 54 A. D.
you already know its location, near the Tomb of Eurysaces, near the Underground Basilica that we also discussed today.
and I had mentioned to you already that the purpose of this gate was to serve as a crossing point for two aqueducts:
aqueducts that had been begun earlier, were worked on by Caligula, and then completed by Claudius.
and there were two of them that crossed at this very point, and they needed something to mask that crossing, and so they built this great gate, the Porta Maggiore.
if you look at this general view of the Porta Maggiore, you will see much of what I have already described.
it has two open archways.
the uppermost part, which is the attic, which has an inscription--it's a three-tiered attic, as you can see, and if you look carefully you will see it has an extensive inscription, making reference to Claudius and to the aqueducts and so on.
down below we see a series of smaller arcuations, surrounded by columns on either side, supporting pediments above.
if you look closely you can see that the pediments are finished, the pediments are finished, the lintels are finished, the capitals are finished, but the blocks of the column and the blocks of the rest of the structure are left in a rusticated state.
they are not finished, and we see that very stark difference between the rusticated masonry and the finished masonry:
the smooth masonry, the dressed masonry and the rough masonry in this structure.
this gate, by the way, is made out of travertine travertine cut stone construction.
here's another view that I think shows you better the way in which this gate masks the crossing of those two aqueducts.
you can see two channels there, and one would have had pipes running through it one way and the other would have had pipes running through it the other way, and that's how they crossed in antiquity.
and I'll show you a model that may make that even clearer in a moment.
you can also see the location of the Tomb of the baker Eurysaces right next to the so-called Porta Maggiore.
here's the model that I showed you when we looked at the Tomb of Eurysaces, the way in which the Praenestina and the Labicana come into Rome and converge at the facade of that tomb.
here you see the great gate or Porta Maggiore behind it.
and this is the best illustration I can give of the way in which those two, the pipes of the two aqueducts, cross behind the attic of the gate, which is one of the reasons it had to be as tall as it did, and one of the reasons it had to have tiers was in order-- because it was separated behind.
you can see that very well here, as well as the rusticated, the contrast between the rusticated masonry and the finished masonry of this great gate.
this combination of the two is a very mannered thing to do, and it's interesting that later Renaissance architects in Italy
and for those of you who are aficionados of the Renaissance, you may know the work of an architect by the name of Giulio Romano who created the famous Palazzo del Te in Mantua.
and I show you a detail of the Palazzo del Te, just to make the point, the more general point-- you don't have to worry about Giulio
but just to make the general point that these Renaissance architects, like Giulio Romano, looked back to buildings like the Porta Maggiore in Rome when they also conceived of buildings in which they contrasted rusticated masonry with smooth masonry, as you can also see so well.
and here are two last details of the Porta Maggiore, and I think these show you, almost more than anything else I have thus far, this incredible contrast between the finished and the unfinished masonry, between the smooth and the rough.
and here you see, you can see a detail of the pediment, of the smoothness of that;
of the lintel down below; of the capital, which is completely finished; and then even of the uppermost part of the column.
and this is a particularly interesting detail, I think, because it gives me the sense, as I look at it, that what the patron and architects are trying to do is give us a sense that the column actually lives inside the rusticated drums.
I get the sense as I look at this that this finished column is just
is very anxious to bust out of the rusticated masonry in which it is confined;
it's very anxious to emerge from that rusticated masonry.
and I can't help but think of the Renaissance again, and especially of Michelangelo.
for any of who've seen his slaves in the Accademia in Florence, the slaves that seem to
he took these big blocks of Carrara marble, and he represents the slaves as if they are still immersed in that marble, but trying to break free from that marble, as if these images of human beings were somehow located inside that marble and just waiting for the genius Michelangelo to free them from that marble.
it's the same sense that I get here when I look at this, and it makes me think again that a very intelligent, a very refined mind is behind sorting out this kind of thing, and conceiving of something of this nature.
and given the education and the bent of Claudius, he is just the kind of man who might have done that.
and I think we need to see the architecture of Claudius, this rusticated architecture of Claudius, which is contrasted to the smooth and finished architecture, at the same time, as something that really is reflective of the peculiar personality of this man.
I think it's also important to say though that this kind of architecture, at this time, is very old-fashioned.
the whole idea of using cut stone travertine construction, after what we've seen is going on in concrete construction, is a very old-fashioned thing to do, and again shows us a man who is looking to the past, who's looking to the history of Rome, to the history of the Etruscans, perhaps rather than to the present.
but, on the positive side, one could also say that what he is doing here, he is using stone construction, but he is using it in a very different way, and indeed an almost anti-classical way, to the way in which Augustus used it.
think of Augustus' Ara Pacis.
think of Augustus' Temple of Mars Ultor in the Forum of Augustus in Rome.
both of those marble buildings, in that case Luna or Carrara marble, based on ancient Greek prototypes.
this is also stone architecture, and in that sense again old-fashioned, but it's travertine, not marble.
but it is anti-classical in its use of this rusticated, as well as smooth masonry.
so I do want you to ponder this architecture of Claudius and think for yourselves about whether you think again it is due, the form that it takes is due to the very interesting and unusual personality of this one man.
from Claudius, I want to turn to the notorious Nero, and his amazing architectural legacy.
and you see a portrait of Nero here, on the right-hand side of the screen, and a coin with his mother on the left.
the mother of Nero was Agrippina the Younger.
Agrippina the Younger was the last wife of Claudius, and it was rumored that Agrippina the Younger murdered Claudius with a bowl of poisoned mushrooms.
we don't know if that's true or not, it may be just rumor mongering.
but it's perfectly conceivable because she certainly had a motive, and that is she thought she would have more power if her teenage son
because he was only about 17-years-old at the time-- was on the throne of Rome, instead of her older husband.
and this coin that you see on the left-hand side of the screen, of the young Nero and Agrippina I think says it all;
I mean, mother and son almost nose to nose.
this gives real meaning to being 'in your face';
as you can see here, Agrippina is certainly in the face of Nero on this coin.
and she was with regard to his life, dominating him in the very early years of his reign.
Nero was born in A. D. 37. He was emperor between 54 and 68.
at his death, his murder--he was forced to commit suicide actually in 68
he suffered a damnatio memoriae, which was a condemnation by the Senate of him, a damnation of his memory;
and an attempt to destroy his portraits, and also his architectural monuments, followed that damnatio memoriae. Nero was the last of the Julio-Claudian emperors.
he was the adoptive son of Claudius, and as I've already mentioned the real son of Claudius' last wife, Agrippina the Elder .
I mentioned already that Agrippina--or I gave you the sense
that Agrippina was a quite aggressive woman who aggravated Claudius and Nero both.
we talked about the poisoned mushroom stories, and the fact that when her son became emperor, she received, at least for a while, enhanced power in Rome.
but Nero eventually paid his mother back by having her murdered in A. D. 59.
he also got rid of his wife Octavia, a beautiful young girl whom he had murdered in 62.
so by the age of 25, Nero had gotten rid of the women, the two women, who had dominated his youth, and his much-touted madness
he was not unlike Caligula in some of the wild things that he did-- his much-touted madness began to appear.
that said, despite his madness, he was absolutely adored by the populace.
it was a great show to watch Nero, and people liked seeing what he would do next.
he was adored by the populace.
he was however hated by the aristocracy and in 68, he was hunted down by his enemies and he was forced to commit suicide.
I would call Nero a patron of architecture extraordinaire.
his contribution to the development of Roman architecture is indeed extraordinary.
he had a passion for the arts, which undoubtedly led to his devotion to building.
he wrote and he sang poems. Nero was a musician. He collected Greek works of art.
he traveled to Greece to participate in the Olympics.
whenever he did that, they were always fixed in his favor.
when he traveled around Greece and Asia Minor, he stole--if he saw a work of art he liked, he stole it, and he brought it back to Rome to display.
he interwove his life with his art, in the same manner as Claudius did.
he took advantage of that very famous fire in Rome, which took place in 64 A. D. to legend has it that he fiddled while Rome burned.
he wasn't fiddling actually but he was participating in some sort of musical performance; we know that.
and after the fire raged through the city and caused incredible havoc and great destruction, what Nero did was instead of rebuilding the land for the people of Rome, he just expropriated 300 to 350 acres of prime real estate in downtown Rome, and he used it to build his own villa, his own palace, in the center of Rome, the famous Domus Aurea or Golden House, because it had a gilded facade.
Nero's architecture was intimately bound up with the vicissitudes of his life and his distinctive, if not warped, personality, as we shall see.
Nero built two palaces in Rome, and I'd like to begin with the one--I'd like to deal with those in consecutive order.
the first of these, as you can see from the Monument List, is the so-called Domus Transitoria
the less well-known one and less well-preserved one
the Domus Transitoria in Rome that was built sometime before the fire, before A. D.64, because it was very significantly destroyed in that fire of A. D. 64.
I'm showing you a Google Earth image of the part of Rome in which this building found itself.
we are looking down--we've seen this one before
we are looking down at the Roman Forum, the Colosseum in the uppermost part there, the Palatine Hill over here.
and if we follow the Roman Forum toward the Colosseum and toward the later Arch of Constantine, we will see that there is a spur hill over, and that spur hill is located between the Palatine Hill and one of Rome's other hills, the Esquiline--E-s-q -u-i-l-i-n-e--the Esquiline Hill.
Nero's dream was to link the buildings that were going up on the Palatine.
we've already talked about the Imperial Palace, begun by Tiberius, continued by Caligula.
Claudius had no interest in that.
but then Nero returns to it, and he's continuing to build this palace on the Palatine.
but his dream is to link that with property that he also owns on the Esquiline Hill, and to make one truly grandiose palace that links those two hills, across a spur hill called the Velia,
V-e-l-i-a, which is in this uppermost part of the Roman Forum, closest to the Colosseum.
that was his dream, and he began to try to realize it prior to 64 A. D.
the building is called the Domus Transitoria because it served as a point of transit between those two hills, between the Palatine and the Esquiline Hills.
again, because it was so seriously destroyed in fire, and also because it was deliberately destroyed by later emperors who were following the damnation, the damnatio memoriae, the damnation of Nero's memory, and felt that it was their right, in a sense, to destroy his buildings.
so those two things together, deliberate destruction plus the fire, essentially destroyed most of the Domus Transitoria.
but a couple of sections are preserved underground, and they're very important for us to look at because they give us insight into the later Golden House or Domus Aurea.
I want to show you the two sections that are still preserved in restored views that you will find in your textbook, in Ward-Perkins.
one of these is located beneath the-- while this is still on the screen, if you look at the Palatine Palace here, just a little bit up beyond where my finger is, there is the dining hall of the later first century A. D.
palace that we'll look at soon, next week. You see it there.
and one of the buildings, a fountain of Nero's Domus Transitoria, is located under that.
and then over here, this temple that you see right close to the Colosseum, is a later Hadrianic Temple of Venus and Roma.
the domed room that I'm going to show you, is under that.
so both of these are underground, beneath later structures.
this is a restored view from Ward-Perkins of the fountain, the fountain court of Nero's Domus Transitoria, and we see a number of important features.
we see an open court with a pool, with columns around it.
on the northern wall over here, we see the fountain itself.
we see that what the architects have done is create, using a niche, a place in that niche, a series of other niches, that served as the location of the actual water from which the fountain emerged, and the water would cascade over this wall down here, and then end up in a long basin in front of it.
the wall is what's most interesting.
if you look at it, you will see that it is essentially scalloped, with columns in the front and then additional columns in the receding bays, creating a kind of in-and-out effect, very similar to theater architecture, and I show you a restored view of a typical theater, of earlier date, just to give you a sense of what this is based on.
you can also see that opening up off this central court, screened by columns, are barrel-vaulted rooms on either side.
these were used as special dining areas;
so special dining areas with beautiful views out onto this fountain court on either side.
and then this restored view also gives you a sense that the pavements were variegated, were done in different designs.
and we know that these pavements were made out of marble and that the walls were revetted with marble.
this isn't the faux marble of the First Style, this is real marble, and it's our first example in Rome of a room that was revetted with marble, brought from all parts of the world: marble brought from Africa, marble brought from Egypt, marble brought from Asia Minor and also from Greece, in various colors, to decorate the fountain court of Nero's Domus Transitoria.
the other room, and perhaps the more important of the two, is the domed room
definitely more important of the two-- the domed room in the Domus Transitoria of Nero.
and you see a restored view of it here. What are we dealing with?
we are dealing with a structure that is clearly based on the thermal bath at Baia and the frigidaria of Pompeii.
it is a concrete structure. It looks as if it's round.
in fact, you can see a circle inscribed in the pavement, down here below.
the structure is made out of concrete. It has a dome and an oculus.
but even though it is inscribed in a circle, if you look carefully at the walls, you will see that although they are curved
they follow the curvature of the circle-- there are eight sides to this wall.
so the architect is starting to explore the idea of an octagon.
this is not an octagon--it's a circle inscribed in an octagon, in a sense--but it is an exploration into an eight-sided form, that we're going to see is very, very important for a later development in the Golden House of Nero.
also what we see here that's very interesting, that's a further development of the frigidarium and thermal bath idea, is instead of this circular structure and an octagon ending with these radiating apses, the four radiating apses that we saw at Baia, for example, we see that they extend into corridors on either side, which expands the space in a way that we have not seen before.
you see, they don't end on either side with these apses with walls, they expand into these long corridors, as you can see, creating a kind of cross shape, and certainly adding to the interesting spatial relationships and spatial possibilities, and the use again of vista and panorama, as we've seen.
we see here also, on either side here, a series of columns with metal grills on top:
so wonderful views through those columns to what lies beyond.
and then on this side, a small pool that had white marble and then colored marbles around that.
so you have to imagine again the overall appearance of this in antiquity, when light would have streamed through the dome of the central space, onto the walls that probably had mosaic on them, through the grills and the columns, onto the water of the white pool here, which was also surrounded with variegated marbles
these same marbles brought from all over the world.
the view must have been quite spectacular.
this is certainly again a form of ostentatious palatial architecture that Augustus eschewed, but was becoming of increasing interest to the likes of Tiberius, Caligula, and ultimately Nero.
and again, just to make the same point again, we can trace this back to the experiments of the frigidaria at Pompeii:
that's the Stabian Baths too, the thermal bath, the Temple of Mercury at Baia.
but look at the difference that it makes when you extend those apses into corridors, creating a much freer spatial situation and adding to the vista and panorama idea that has been so popular, as we've long seen, with the Romans.
in the time that remains, I want to turn to Nero's most important architectural commission, and I can't over-emphasize the significance of this structure that I'm going to show you now, the so-called Domus Aurea or the Golden House of Nero, again because of its gilded facade.
we've already talked about the fire that raged through Rome in 64, and that when that fire, when the smoke from that fire died down, that Nero expropriated 300 to 350 acres in prime downtown Rome, for his own use, for a private palace, the so-called Golden House.
we see a site plan here, also from Ward-Perkins, where you can get a sense, not only of the extent of this
look how it covers ground from the Circus Maximus, all the way across, to the Esquiline Hill, as you can see so well here.
so the Palatine Hill, the Esquiline Hill, and also even the Caelian Hill over here.
he dug an artificial -- or he had his architects dig an artificial lake in the center of this, as you can see here.
and the Golden House was very extensive.
there's only one part of it that remains today, under the--or as part of the Esquiline Hill in Rome, and we therefore call it the Esquiline Wing of the Domus Aurea of Nero.
this palace had an incredible set of gimmicks, gimmicks that were so noteworthy that the names of the architects have come down to us, the architect and engineer who are responsible for this.
and I think it is largely they came down to us largely because of these incredible gimmicks that they created for this structure.
their names were Severus and Celer; Severus and Celer.
and I believe I have put their names on the Monument List for you.
yes I have, underneath the plan of the Esquiline Wing.
so Severus and Celer; their names suggest to us that they were Roman architects, in fact.
and these gimmicks included a 125-foot statue of Nero himself, a colossal stature--or the Colossus, as it is designated here--a colossal statue of Nero assimilated to the sun god Sol, S-o-l, the sun god Sol, and it was done in bronze and it was done by a famous artist, whose name we also know, Zenodorus
I've also put his name on the Monument List for you
zenodorus, who was a very famous bronze caster.
so Zenodorus' Colossus, the gilded facade.
and what were some of the gimmicks that Severus and Celer added to this palace?
when you ate in the dining hall, if you were invited as a special guest to eat with Nero, while you were eating the coffered ceilings of one of the dining rooms would drop on you all kinds of wonderful fragrances and flower petals, while you ate.
there was also a bath that gave you a choice of sea water and salt water and water from the sulfur springs of Tivoli;
you had your choice, if you were bathing at Nero's Domus Aurea.
and most spectacularly of all, and I think what Severus and Celer had particular fame for, was they created a banqueting room that had a revolving ceiling, supposedly, a ceiling that revolved with the heavenly bodies.
so an incredible array of gimmicks, as I said before, in this extraordinary palace, but all of them clearly possible Vis-à-vis architecture at this time.
I'm showing you here a plan of the Esquiline Wing.
this is the one part of the palace that survives today.
we'll talk about what happened to this palace in a later lecture, but you can see it here.
dozens and dozens of rooms around a five-sided court, as you can see at this location.
and then here, what is the so-called octagonal room of Nero's Domus Aurea, which is a remarkable room.
and I think it's fair to say the single most important room that I will have shown you thus far this semester is the octagonal room of Nero's Domus Aurea.
and you see it here.
you can see the plan of the octagon, and then the radiating spaces out from it.
I'll return to that plan in just a moment.
just to mention though, by using Google Earth again,
I can show you the particular location of the Esquiline Wing on the Esquiline Hill today.
what happened to it eventually--and again I'm not going to go into the details now but I will in the future-- after Nero's damnatio memoriae, some of this was destroyed and much of it was incorporated into later buildings.
eventually a bath of the emperor Trajan ended up on this site, and the emperor covered over what remained of Nero's Domus Aurea, what hadn't been razed to the ground, and incorporated some of it into his later bath.
and, in fact, this hemicycle of Trajan's Baths is actually the entranceway today of the Domus Aurea.
you can see it right here, and you can see that the other remains of both Trajan's Baths and of the Domus Aurea have been incorporated into a modern garden, a very attractive garden where you can wander and see some of the remains of both.
and actually what you see here--it just shows how amazing Google Earth is
this circle that you see here is actually-- it has a grate on top today
but it is actually the oculus of Nero's octagonal room, which is down below, which is located underground.
so if you visit the Domus Aurea, which is, as you can see, right near the Colosseum, you go into the entranceway through the hemicycle of Trajan's later baths, and you find yourself in a series of corridors.
we've talked about these corridors before, because we talked about the paintings that Fabullus did, for Nero's Domus Aurea; first the Third Style paintings and then the Fourth Style paintings.
and you'll remember that the Domus Aurea was described as Fabullus' prison, because there were so many rooms and corridors that it would take a whole lifetime to paint them.
and you see some of those here: barrel vaulted corridors, stuccoed over, and then painted in the Third and Fourth styles.
another gimmick that you see throughout the Domus Aurea are a series of bridges that are built to carry water from one part of the palace to another.
another view here showing one of the corridors, and what you see here is something that we have not discussed yet, but is the wave of the future, and that is concrete faced with brick.
after the fire there was realization-- the fire of 64--there was realization that stone burned too easily, it was not an effective facing any longer, and that they needed to come up with something else.
brick worked better with fire.
so the decision was taken to move--and this is not the tile brick in Pompeii, this is real brick--and the decision was taken to begin to use brick-faced construction for these buildings.
at this time it was stuccoed over, as you can see here: stucco, and then painted on top.
so you wouldn't have actually seen the brick in antiquity, but we'll see it was not long until the Romans recognized that brick was a very attractive material in its own right, and began to leave it exposed.
but we're not there yet.
the paintings, the Fourth Style paintings of Fabullus.
you'll remember this one that we've already looked at, with the reintroduction of architectural fragments and the architectural cages in the Domus Aurea.
this is the single--as I've already said-- the single most remarkable and important room that I've shown you thus far this semester, the octagonal room in Nero's Domus Aurea.
you see this cross-section plan, an axonometric view from Ward-Perkins here.
and you can get a very good sense of this.
this is truly an octagonal room.
the experiment in the domed room, where they had inscribed a circle into an octagon, gave them the idea that they were going to try to make an actual octagonal room out of concrete, and they succeed here.
you can see the eight sides of this room.
you can see it has a series of radiating alcoves, but much bigger alcoves than we saw in the frigidaria at Pompeii, or in the thermal bath at Baia, and differently shaped ones-- not all the same, but a couple are cross-shaped and others are rectangular-- different shapes.
and then the axonometric view shows you that within those alcoves there are additional niches in some of the walls that give more of a sculptural quality to this than has been the case before.
and this again was no small feat on the part of these architects.
why is the Domus Aurea so important-- excuse me--the octagonal room of the Domus Aurea so important?
the octagonal room of the Domus Aurea
and I've given you a number of bullet points here
represents a break from the tyranny of the rectangle, the tyranny of the rectangle that we know from Greek and Etruscan architecture.
it enables vistas to be created in every direction, and you know the importance to Romans of vistas and panoramas.
it creates one continuous envelope around an interior space.
it fully realizes--this development has been long in coming but we're finally there
it fully realizes the technical and expressive potentiality of Roman concrete construction.
it represents a switch of emphasis from solids to voids
from walls and roofs that we saw in such buildings as the Temple of Portunus, to the insubstantial space that they enclose and shape.
it is the interior space, not the walls that matter now.
and in this new interior architecture, light plays a key role:
natural light that creates drama, as well as illuminates.
the importance of the octagonal room of Nero's Domus Aurea cannot be overstated
the octagonal room heralds the Roman architectural revolution that we saw already beginning at places like Palestrina, but it is finally here, in its full-blown form;
whereas I said the potentiality of the expressiveness of Roman concrete is fully realized.
this is the room itself, as it looks today.
we can see the octagon, we can see the dome.
we can see the way in which the octagon becomes the dome, the eight sides and the way it is shaped to become the dome above.
we can see some of the niches here.
we can see the way in which the spaces expand from the central space, and we can see niches within those, to give a greater sculptural quality to it.
and you can get a little bit of the sense of the light here.
this would have been elaborately decorated in antiquity.
I show you a restored view.
all of those same marbles, from Egypt, from Africa, from Asia Minor, from Greece, all brought together here; lots of different colors.
this is what those Pompeians wished their walls actually looked like.
but you see real marble revetted walls, marble pavements, and then up above
in all kinds of colors -- and then up above the ceiling stuccoed over and also painted.
one can only imagine Nero entering into this octagonal room, and how he must have felt.
and, in fact, we have a quote from Nero, in which he says that when the Domus Aurea in Rome was finished-- or he's reported to have said, when the Domus Aurea in Rome was finished-- he's reported to have said, and I quote:
at last, at last, I am going to be able to be housed like a human being.
that was the way Nero thought about this.
he achieved his goal, undoubtedly, at least for a short period of time before he died in 68.
and I believe--and I'm sure you agree with me
I believe that it is for the Domus Aurea, especially for the octagonal room of the Domus Aurea, that Nero would have liked to be remembered, and indeed he achieved his goal.
thank you.
you go voluntarily, you wave your right to fight extradition.
it's not going to make a difference, rick.
rio de Janeiro Brazil
so what happens now?
it's very simple.
as far as I'm concerned...
you are free to go.
this is mala noche justice
como?
como?
mala noche justice...
meet miami justice.
you made it.
Yeah, but a lot of people didn'T.
what's going on?
Calleigh was abducted while following a lead on the newberry case.
searched for her all night.
finally tracked her gps, we were unable to locate her.
okay.
Yeah, I'm with h right now.
that's tripp.
they found calleigh's hummer.
we got to find her.
aerial unit spotted it.
no sign of calleigh. No eyewitnesses either.
we'll be right down.
cell phone and her kit are still in the car.
whoever did this was smart enough to disable the gps tracking unit.
this is too damaged for ibis, eric.
Yeah. Yeah, well, shot came through the window, so, there's probably a cleaner bullet inside the car.
gentlemen, I don't see any skid marks, do you?
that means she slowed to a stop before the gunfire.
it also means this was an ambush.
this just isn't sitting with me.
Calleigh was armed. We all know she wouldn't go down without a fight.
What'd you get, eric?
got some sort of reflective trace.
let's get that to the lab and I'll catch up to you gentlemen later.
what the hell u think happened in brazil?
he didn't say.
I'm just glad he's back.
Hey, any luck with the trace found outside calleigh' s hummer?
I wouldn't call it luck.
call it chloroform.
no wonder she didn't put up a fight.
do you think that it's any coincidence that kathleen newberry was also subdued with chloroform?
I don't think that we can afford any coincidences.
every minute that calleigh's missing, her odds get worse.
then I think we should speak to newberry's suspected killer, ron saris.
Horatio's already on it.
you chloroformed kathleen newberry and then killed her.
Horatio, as I told you before you were arrested for murder in brazil, uh, there's no evidence to prove that.
one of my csi's was chloroformed and abducted last night.
and I see that as a pattern, ron.
thousands of people can get their hands on chloroform.
Yes.
but I'm only looking for one.
well, I'm happy for you, but I know you can't hold me so, I'm, uh...
I... I want to thank you. For brazil.
um... worked out really well for the two of us, didn't it?
because, uh, julia and I, we got back together.
best of luck finding your csi.
if anything happens to my csi, this'll be your last week on earth.
pick her up.
what do you want from me?
we want to "solve a crime with calleigh.
see, our poker buddy, robert, he, uh, hmm...
he didn't give us what we wanted.
so he had to pay the price.
and then, tommy found your website.
look, you're a csi, right?
make it so this can't be traced back to us.
you expect me to cover up a murder?
okay. Okay.
uh, let me think.
you need gloves.
and we got to bleach the floor.
wipe up all the surfaces for fingerprints, for shoe prints, for any skin trace.
what else?
I need to get the bullet out of the body.
they could trace it back to your gun.
but you're going to have to untie me for that.
you're lucky. This bullet's near the surface.
stop.
where do you think you're going?
I need to get something to get the bullet out with.
get rid of that.
good.
you think you can get the next bullet out on your own?
yeah?
what do we need her for?
I wouldn't do that.
why is that?
that bullet smells like garlic.
what the hell does that mean?
it means I need you to get me some toilet cleaner, a lint roller, speaker wire and a black light.
Yeah, we'll get right on that.
you know, you should stop stalling.
just trying to do what you asked me to do.
look, I think we should see what she can do.
okay.
you can be her delivery boy.
it'll give me a chance to get to know this bitch one on one.
go.
I'd smoke that cigar.
Yeah, I was planning to afterwards.
but... if that's what turns you on, then...
the smell of the cigar will mask the smell of decomp.
yeah?
unless, of course, you want your neighbors calling the cops down here.
you're not as stupid as you look.
can we have a minute, son?
um, take these with you.
go ahead, sweetie, andI'll see you in a second.
I guess you weren't expecting to see me again, huh?
no.
but horatio, I didn't want you to die.
I thought you'd have a better chance in brazil than here against ron saris.
so I take it that's his dry ngeanicl?
he's living with us now.
whatever ron is or isn'T... - he's a killer.
he got me my son back.
Yes, but he killed kathleen newberry to do it.
I had nothing to do with that.
the one witness who saw what kyle did is gone.
can't you just let this go?
one of my csis is missing.
and you think ron had something to do with it?
it was a roadside abduction, that's his signature.
Oh, my god.
if you stay with this man, you and kyle are going to die.
pick it up.
Tommy's out there running errands, I thought that maybe...
me and you could waste a little time.
I'd rather die than have you touch me.
last words.
let's hear them. Huh?
I don't think you killed the poker player.
took you long enough.
not like there's a store that sells everything on earth, seth.
I need the toilet cleaner and the stereo wire.
would you hand me one of those mugs and a corkscrew, please?
what are you doing?
it's called the reinsch test.
I take some of his tissue and I put it into a solution of hydrochloric acid.
and the acid will separate the inorganic from the organic molecules.
it's basic chemistry.
then I put the copper wire in and see if it turns gray.
it's gray, so what?
it's positive for the presence of heavy metal.
from the bullet when we shot him.
no, it's a different kind of metal.
um, mercury, thallium, selenium -
the atoms from one of those metals will bind to the copper and turn it gray.
I would say you're looking at...acute arsenic poisoning.
wait, wait. So you're saying that we could be off the hook?
she's saying that somebody killed him before we shot him.
what's the black light for?
it's for our next location.
I can tell that this is not the primary crime scene.
no, no, no-- we're not taking you anywhere.
you just told us he was poisoned.
the bullet wound is perimortem.
ultimately, it's up to the medical examiner, but the police could still charge you with attempted murder, which is 25 years to life.
if you make a sound, if you even think about running,
I promise you, I will not hesitate.
you're not allowed in here.
it's about calleigh.
she's still missing, right? - Yeah, she's still missing.
she's been abducted, coop.
now, what do you want?
it's the memory card from the first kidnap victim, kathleen newberry.
I thought it might help you find her.
Yeah, I hope so.
there are a lot of similarities between the newberry case and calleigh'S.
chloroform, both kidnapped from public places...
Yeah, and ron saris doesn't have an alibi for either one.
if we could just get that guy for murder, maybe we could get him to tell us who he's working with.
I won't let calleigh end up like that other woman.
what's that? What is that line?
well, I'm not sure. Let's take a closer look.
some kind of a string?
that wasn't on the car when we looked at it in our garage.
maybe it fell off in transit.
Yeah, it's not like these tow truck drivers look for evidence.
you gotta be fair, though. They're paid to tow, not solve our cases.
all I'm saying is that if they would've tried a little harder, then maybe calleigh wouldn't be missing right now.
I know what you're saying. I'm just saying that we could play "what if" all day.
the important thing is finding her, right?
Yeah.
Ryan, yeah, I need you to stop by the tow yard.
excuse me, sir?
sir!
sir, could you do me a favor and take a break?
sir, please?
could you do me a favor and stop, please?
may I help you?
you could help me by taking a little bit of a break.
Thanks, man.
bingo.
that's a match, ron, a perfect match.
which places you at the scene.
correction. Uh, it puts a dirty piece of string under a car that you pulled from a lake.
I think that after you pushed her car into the water, you caught your shoe under her bumper.
all right.
you know, I'm not gonna talk anymore.
conspiracy to kidnap a law enforcement officer carries a life sentence.
why, horatio, would I bother with a csi?
why would I do that when I've got what I needed?
I've got julia back.
and we both know how that happened. Don't we?
by killing the newberry lady?
okay, you're never going to prove that.
never.
I just did.
not after I talk to the state attorney and tell them that you coerced evidence unlawfully.
assault and battery.
you beat me up to get what you needed.
you stole my shoelace.
nice try, ron.
well, that bruise should show up about the same time as the state attorney,
I would say, don't you?
now, horatio, tell me.
are they gonna believe me, or are they gonna blame a cop who got extradited to brazil for killing a man?
just remember what I said, ron.
I will.
I'm going to go to julia now.
Oh, I'll say hi to your son for you.
do that.
Ouch.
you know, unless the bullet ricocheted, it's probably on the passenger side.
well, I haven't found anything yet.
well, maybe the window shattered when the bullet hit the door.
hand me a screwdriver.
Yeah, what do you need it for?
got a crack in the door panel.
aren't we looking for a bullet hole?
we are, but sometimes this rigid plastic -
it does funny things when it's hit by a bullet.
it'll crack open and snaps back shut like a swinging door.
I don't even have that gun anymore.
well, if you sold it, where's the rece there is no receipt.
I lost it in a poker game last night.
what, nobody could change a hundred?
I've lost my watch, my boat, maxed-out my visa.
the gun was all I had on me.
didn't change the cards, though.
who'd you lose it to?
like I know his real name.
well, no legal casino is gonna allow you to bet with a gun.
sounds like an underground game to me.
Yeah, so?
so one of our own csis has been abducted with that gun.
you need to tell us where the game was played.
we've already got you on illegal gambling, sport.
it's time to show your cards.
it was an old factory building.
I think it was 1429 wimberly.
you better hope you're right.
H, yeah, we got an address.
got a body, eric.
it's not calleigh.
it smells like bleach.
well, his fingernails have been scraped.
body is positioned.
clothes pulled in a single direction.
someone took a lint roller to him, d movereany trace.
the body's been cleaned.
this whole room has.
professionally, which is why they grabbed calleigh-- to cover this murder.
what have you got?
I've got some prints.
got a lot of prints, H.
it's a number 60.
60 is a police code for a two-man unit.
she's leaving us a message, eric.
she's telling us she was taken by two men, which means she was alive when she left this room.
Yeah, but for how long?
that's going to be priority number one, gentlemen.
excuse me.
Hey. What the hell's going on?
and you are?
I'm mitch davis. I own the buil ng.
I have plans to turn this place into lofts.
nobody's supposed to be in there.
well, somebody was, Mr. Davis, and now they're on the way to the coroner's office.
you people really need to step up the patrols around here.
I am not in the business of providing room and board to a bunch of squatters.
a man was shot and killed and found next to a poker table.
does that ring a bell?
a poker table?
first murder, now illegal gambling. Well, th-that's great.
so what am I supposed to do-- build a moat?
why don't you start with security cameras?
now you can see our cleaning job.
I'm gonna need the black light.
what do you need that for?
show you what you missed.
this is where robert was shot.
what the hell, man?!
I thought you said you cleaned it. - I did, I swear.
his wound was in the abdomen, and based on the amount of blood here,
I would say that he landed face down.
y-you're right.
we just wanted to ask him where the next poker tournament was going to be.
so you guys like to gamble?
no, we like the entry fee.
tonight's the big one.
ten guys with 100 k buy-in each.
so you were planning a robbery. And what?
robert got in the way?
look, no, we thought he was our in.
we used to play nickel ante games down at the marina.
he liked it.
when we asked him for the address, he, like, freaked out.
I told you.
I don't know where.
just give us the address.
this tournament isn't for you.
toss a few more cards and come back in a couple years.
I thought he was trying to make a move on us.
was robert using this flask?
Yeah.
if he was poisoned, we might be able to get something off of it.
go to the medicine cabinet, see if you can find some iodine.
Why?
you'll see.
stop!
what are you trying to do?
start a fire, get the cops here?
look, this is called a fuming chamber.
the smoke is supposed to be there.
the hot chemical is going to stick to any print that's on the flask.
I've got two prints.
okay, if you give me yours, I can exclude you.
do I look stupid to you?
you just want our prints so that your friends can pick us up later.
you know what, if you don't trust me now, you're never going to.
I don't trust cops.
you can have my prints.
I trust you.
look, I don't know what he's been telling you, but this is not going to end well.
we're already in too deep. We have no other choice.
no, that is not true.
if you take the flask to the police, give it to them, it will point them in a totally different direction.
you've got to turn yourself in.
I'm telling you it is the only way.
I don't know.
I do. You are not the same person that he is.
just find a way to get out of here, any way you can.
what kind of excuse? I don't know what to say.
I'll give you one.
what are you two talking about?
we're going to need bleach soon.
you're up, delivery boy.
so, alexx, this is our poker player.
Yeah, horatio, but there's no id yet.
and something weird-- his heart showed signs of cardiac arrest.
he had a heart attack?
Yes.
so I sent some samples to tox.
turns out it was caused by acute arsenic toxicity.
so the poisoning caused the heart attack.
there was also significant postmortem tearing around the wound, as if someone had gone digging.
and look at this, horatio.
from weird to weirder.
alexx, that's a piece of a cigar.
okay, you're saying that as if it makes perfect sense.
inside the layering of that tobacco could be dna.
I'm gonna take that with me.
so you're saying that calleigh left this in the wound tract for us to find?
I am.
pick it up.
will you hand me one of those mugs and a corkscrew, please?
Seth mcadams, attempted rape.
here we go.
I had units roll out to seth mcadams' last known.
what did we learn, frank?
he hasn't been seen in days.
no sign of the guy.
hang on a second.
can I help you?
the name's tommy.
I know something about a murder.
talk to me.
but I had, like, nothing to do with it, though.
look, I-I even got proof.
does this have to do with the missing csi?
me and my friend...
we took her.
where is the missing csi right now?
7501 whitlock.
robert milland's house.
take him, frank.
take him.
Eric, 7501 whitlock.
get swat.
tactical units to 7501 whitlock.
officer hostage situation in progress.
clear.
we clear?
all clear.
H? Yeah, the house is clean.
I'm not sure if calleigh was here, but, uh, she's not now.
what else?
hang on a second.
found an interesting picture of our murder victim.
he's with that guy, the landlord, that said he has nothing to do with the poker games.
so he's a liar.
bring him in.
I didn't shoot robert.
neither did the killer.
he was poisoned using arsenic.
you lied to us.
because you knew robert milland, and you knew about the poker game.
Yeah, well, that's only half true.
I knew robert.
we used to hit vegas together, but he got tired of the casino scene.
said that underground poker was more... exciting.
so you let him use your buildings for a cut of the action?
no way.
those games are full of criminals.
robert liked to play the gangster.
not me.
so you're saying he broke into your buildings?
Yeah. I had trouble unloading the building.
he took advantage of it. Pissed me off.
and you wanted to make sure that'd never happen again, right?
I swear, I didn'T.
you know where csi duquesne is?
because if you do, you better tell me.
lieutenant caine is working on the killer's fingerprints, and if they match yours, I'm not going to be so nice a second time.
you sure you don't know where tommy went?
you heard him-- he went to get bleach.
Yeah, and he never came back after whispering in the corner with you.
maybe he got caught, or maybe he got scared.
you're the one who should be scared, bitch.
see, you just became my new partner.
and we're about to pull off the biggest heist in underground miami.
here?
you flask
I just...couldn't lose again.
explain that, please.
I was in a rut.
robert was too good.
he was always rubbing it in my face, you know, just...
always had to bring up the new rolex.
the donzi.
his hummer.
all paid for by my kid's college fund.
sorry, girls.
looks like community college for the little ones.
I didn't want my wife to find out how deep I was in.
so by getting rid of him, you figured you'd increase your odds.
I had to win back some of what I lost.
for my family...
I just wanted to mess with his game, so I...
I spiked his flask.
look, the guy never took a sip.
walked away with the biggest pot of the night. How'd he do that?
he drank it after the game, paul.
it gave him a heart attack.
you didn't lose your gun in that game, did you, paul?
no.
I was so pissed.
I drove by robert's place afterwards.
I saw the hummer a few streets over.
I thought it was his.
fired off a few rounds.
freaked when i saw the csi decal.
I don't blame you.
have we made any progress, miss boa vista?
I had the techs scour this entire place, and there's just nothing that says that tommy garver or seth mcadams was ever here.
well, what we do know is they had calleigh clean the place.
she did such a great job of helping us id these suspects.
I just wish there was a way she could have told us where she went.
maybe there is.
better not miss one fingerprint.
Hello, talk to me.
club descent, 6:00 P. M.
I'll be there.
$100, 000 buy-in?
perfect.
Yes, I got her.
okay. All right.
and if I'm not mistaken, baking soda...
and grape juice...
look at that.
invisible ink.
precisely.
descent. 6 P. M.
club descent. You know it?
I know it.
just got one last little errand, and then this is all gonna be over for you, my dear.
the poker game?
that's my girl.
what do you need me for?
let's just say I'm not exactly on the invite list.
here.
my badge.
get him to open the door.
go!
Miami-Dade P. D.
sorry. Invitation only.
Yeah, here's my invite.
all right, ladies, poker game's over.
I want all your cash now.
come on.
drop the guns, or I will shoot her.
you're not gonna get the chance.
now, if I were you, I'd fold.
don't you agree, calleigh?
clear!
you messed with the wrong people.
so you're sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
what are you gonna do?
are you gonna take some time off?
I really don't know, to be honest.
I think I just want to go home, think about what happened.
Hey, you're not going home alone.
Eric, I'm fine.
I really am, I promise, but thank you.
I'm not.
I don't know what I would have done if something would have happened to you today.
okay.
our primary suspect is Sergeant James Doakes.
he is not your man.
I think the Bay Harbor Butcher is alive and still in Miami.
Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher, end of story.
I found a blood slide at a crime scene exactly like the ones we found in Doakes' car, and Doakes never had a boat.
here is a list of Miami Metro personnel who still do.
its point of origin--front center mass burned upward, downward.
can we close the doors?
this void, it's the same thing that happened with the first car victim.
"Bobby"? Maybe the victim was letting us know who did this.
you fucked my girl? - You know, you could learn a thing or two from her.
she takes her job very seriously.
have you always been this afraid of the water?
ever since my father thought that the best way to teach me how to swim was to march me down to the local pondand throw me in.
that's horrible.
six years old, and I already knew what it felt like to be dying.
look, I think you have the wrong idea. - Shut up.
I know who you are. I know what you are.
Dexter, you don't have to save her.
you shouldn't even be with her.
it's not even like you will have a fucking future.
all I know is that, when I'm with you, I feel.
safe.
the dark...whatever
I saw him, and he was coming through the flames.
he was wearing a silver-colored suit. - That's our phantom arsonist.
he looked like an alien. - Or a monster. I swear, he was 7 feet tall.
monsters, aliens, phantoms--none of them are real.
the thought that an actual person could do this is too awful, so our imaginations create a way to make it easier to take.
but even the strongest of imaginations can't protect us once we know the truth.
I called you last night. I wanted to go over the facts of the case.
we can go over them now. - Where were you?
Oh. You were with Hannah.
find anything? DNA? Prints? - Nope, nada, zip.
same accelerant as the other four fires, though--kerosene.
and he left another "Bobby" scribbled in the soot.
fuck, that's five "Bobby"s in two weeks.
I mean, he's gotta be signing his name, right?
I mean, it's the only thing that makes sense.
none of the victims were named Bobby, but, I mean, fuckload of good that does us. There are thousands of Bobs and Roberts in Miami.
what do we know about the latest victim?
mom took her daughter to the bathroom. They both went up in smoke.
kid was six years old.
what kind of sick fuckdoes that to a six-year-old kid?
maybe the kind who isn't botheredby the sight of a dead child.
how you feeling? You get your stitches out?
Yeah, I'm going to have a really sexy scar.
how was your day? - It was fine.
you don't sound fine.
the phantom started another fire today. It killed a mother and child.
what? - Why do I get the feelingyou want to wrap him up in plastic?
doesn't matter. I promised Deb I wouldn't take any cases from the police.
well, if you always listened to Deb, you wouldn't be here with me.
I can't kill him, okay? - Okay, ne.
sorry.
I'm just frustrated.
as much as I want to be here with you, my dark passenger really wants to be somewhere else.
I'm sorry. Your dark what?
my dark passenger. That's what I call my need to kill. - Why?
because it's like this thing living inside me, telling me what to do, saying I have to kill, not leaving me any choice.
you're not a puppet. Of course you have a choice.
actually, I don't.
come on, Dex. It's just you.
you're the one who wants the arsonist dead.
and I don't blame you. Who wouldn't?
it's not the same. - Well, what do you mean?
ignore that. I-I want to understand this. How is it different?
cause a lot of people feel like they want to kill somebody, - but I have to follow through. - I follow through, and I don't have a.
dark passenger. - You don't get it.
I'm trying to.
but, no, I don't get it.
there's a man in the window. - What?
Hi, Banana! - Oh, my God. That's my dad.
I'm sorry if I surprised you. I didn't even know Hannah had a boyfriend.
I don't know why you would. I haven't spoken to you since
go ahead and say it. Since before I went to prison.
Clint McKay, convicted felon. Nice to meet you.
no need to get nervous. I was just in for check kiting, and I got out early on good behavior.
dad, what are you doing here? - Well, let me just get to the point.
I don't know what Hannah's told you about me.
not a lot. Just that you almost let her drown.
well, the truth is,
I was real, genuine asshole of a father.
and I needed to admit that to you in person.
dad, can we please not do this in front of Dexter?
no, if you two are together, then I-I want him to hear this.
I spent a lot of time with a prison shrink, working through my issues.
he said it's important to take responsibility, so that's what I'm here to do.
okay.
now, I don't expect you to forgive me.
I don't see any reason that you should, not after everything I put you through.
but it's important you know, no matter what, I always loved you.
I always will.
I've got something for you in my truck.
let me give it to you, and I'll be on my way.
surprise.
it's your dollhouse, repainted and rebuilt.
it was in your Aunt Cindy's garage.
I figured you loved it so much as a kid, you might like to have it now.
Dex, give me a hand?
well, I guess I'll be on my way, let you twoget back to your dinner.
there's a diner at the Purple Flamingo, where I'm staying.
they say they make a pretty decent burger.
okay.
okay.
I guess I'll see you around then.
nice to meet you, Dexter.
you look good, Banana, happy.
glad to see you're doing okay.
I'm sure he meant well, but he could not have given me a worse gift.
brings up so much shit.
what kind of shit? - When I was eight, he took me to a poker tournament, lied to my mom and said that we were going to a county fair, and stashed me in a motel room.
went to play cards and didn't come back for three days.
that's awful.
when he came back, he brought the dollhouse, bragging about a big win, saying that he'd never leave me again, and making promises that things would get better.
and did they? - No. Of course not.
I don't know.
I'm--he's trying, right? Maybe -maybe this last stint in lockup did him some good.
Yeah, maybe.
most likely, we're lookingfor a male suspect.
egocentric, manipulative, possibly in or on the outskirts of law enforcement.
he's methodical.
fastidious in his appearance, poor social skills--this list is by no means comprehensive.
but it should give you a pretty good ideaof what we're looking at.
Bosso's profile of the phantom--he may as well be describing himself.
an arsonist who works for the fire department. It's almost too easy.
what else?
hands-on learner, prone to self-aggrandizement.
thank you, investigator Bosso.
where are we on tracking the fireproof suit?
Oh, there's at least 100 sites that sell that on the Internet.
almost impossible to trace.
are you guys still interviewing witnesses?
Yeah, but nobody's seen the guy's face.
we got more people coming in today though.
let me know what you find out. Simms, Miller, any leads from the tip line?
none so far.
mostly girlfriends trying to get back at their exes.
all right. Keep at it. Maybe something will come through.
in the meantime, this fuck has killedseven people in two weeks.
let's stop him before he makes it to number eight.
Hannah's wrong. Of course I have a dark passenger.
there's no other way to explain this compulsion.
hannah: meeting clint for coffee with me luck XOXO
Dexter: luck
I hope she knows what she's doing.
who's sending you hugs and kisses?
no one.
bullshit. That was a girl. Was she sexting you?
you got pictures? Come on, I gotta restock my spank bank.
Hey, Angel, do you know anything about Dexter's new girlfriend?
who, Hannah McKay? - How did you--Jamie told me.
my man.
Hannah McKay! Yeah, that is so awesome.
excuse me, but what is so fucking awesomeabout my brother dating a killer?
you guys heard Sal Price's recording. Hannah confessed to murder.
Oh, come on, she was only 15 when she did that.
I mean, when I was 15, my parents still thoughtI was retarded.
Hey, hey. I get it.
Hannah is an attractive girl.
but you should probably be careful.
Yeah, you--you should definitely be carefulof getting burned because she's so freaking hot.
can I see you in my office, please?
I didn't realizeyou and Hannah McKay had gone public.
we hadn't, until a minute ago.
well, that's kind of dangerous. Don't you think?
dating someone so notorious out in the open like that, the radar. when you're trying to stay under
Deb, I really don't want to talk about Hannah right now. Can you just leave it?
fine, yeah. I'll butt out.
I mean, we're all responsible adults, right?
you live your life, I'll live mine, and Hannah will live Hannah's.
great. And you'll leave Hannah alone?
I'm saying that I'll stay out of your relationship.
I'm not going to let that woman get away with murder again.
that's not what I meant. - Dexter, I am fucking serious.
I have compromised the shit out of myself for you.
I am sure as fuck not going to do it for Hannah McKay.
fine. I get it.
why are you standing here? We have a phantom to catch.
PRAZOLAM 0. 2-DEBRA MORGAN
she did say "we."Philip Bosso.
in his last 27 arson investigations, he found the fire's origin point.
either he's great at his job, or all he had to do was look in the mirror.
okay, it says herethat you work as a janitor at the Y in Brickell Bay where the, uh, phantom set the first fire.
did you see anything suspiciouswhen you were making your rounds that night?
no, I didn't even know it happeneduntil I saw the fire truck. It was horrible.
right. Right, right, right. And did you see anyone in a fireproof suit?
don't you think I would've told you if I had?
Bosso's S. U.V. But where did he go?
is he about to strike again?
electric fuses and camping fuel.
what are you doing here?
that's not a fireproof suit.
Dexter, you a Civil War reenactor too?
you here for the battle?
Yeah.
which side you fighting for?
the North. - You Blue Belly.
I should buck and gag you right here.
were you there last weekendat the Sixth Maine Battery cannon firings?
no, damn. I guess I missed that one.
it's a whole weekend affair.
I was in charge of special effects--ground, air bursts, artillery fire.
which explains what's in his carand gives him an alibi for Saturday's fire.
want to see some pictures? - You bet.
Bosso's not the phantom.
he's just strange.
but if he didn't set those fires, then who did?
hang on just one sec.
hannah: having dinner w/clint. dane's in south beach wanna join?
Dexter: c you soon
I guess coffee went better than expected.
after coffee, Hannah wanted to show me the Flower Mart.
so we're walking around, and I catch a whiff of this flower.
it smells just like licorice.
so I ask Hannah what it is--And I tell him it's anise.
so I tell the lady in the booththat her anise smells delicious.
except you didn't quite pronounce it right.
I don't know exactly what I said, but she did not react well.
well, do you blame her?
sounds like you had quite a day.
Yeah, uh-- we, uh, we really did.
so, Clint, how long are you going to be in town?
Oh, just another day or so. And then I'm off to Louisiana.
Oh, uh, what's in Louisiana? A poker tournament?
no. I am all done with that. I am looking for an honest way to make a living.
and I think I found the perfect thing. You ready?
crawfish.
crawfish? - Yeah, a crawfish farm.
I got a line on one near Lafayette.
I'm going to call it "Big Clint's Crawdaddies,
and I will ship 'em to you freshanywhere in the country.
there's a market for that? - You bet your balls there is.
ain't nothing like a crawfish boil--weddings, bachelor parties, fourth of July.
everybody likes crawdads.
well, I am excited for you, Dad.
and I'm proud of you.
well, thank you, honey.
means a lot.
well, I'll tell you what. Why don't you check out of that moteland come and stay with me while you're here?
you're starting a new business. You're going to need to save your money now.
no, no, no, no. I couldn't do that. I-I wouldn't want to intrude.
Oh, you're not. - Yeah, don't worry. I was going home tonight anyway.
why don't I bring you guys breakfast in the morning? Best doughnuts you ever tasted.
okay.
what the hell are you doing, man? - Get out of here.
man, it's like I died and went to heaven.
I think if I had one more of those, I probably will.
I'd like to make an orange juice toastto the cutest damn couple
I have ever seen--outside of me and Bubba in prison.
that's just a little joke.
right. - Well, to you, Dad, the king of crawfish.
there's no stopping me.
I just gotta get the money together.
so where are you at with that?
well, actually, that's something I wanted to talk to you about.
I figured you might like to get in on the ground floor.
what do you mean? - Well, you know, invest.
I only need about 20 grand more.
no, it's a great opportunity.
I mean, there's a guaranteed 10% a year backon your investment.
I'm sorry, Dad. I-I can't.
all my money's tied up in the business.
Aw, come on, now. Not all your money.
I mean, there's got to be a little wiggle roomin there somewhere.
I'm sure you could remortgage your place. - I don't think so.
no, this place has got to be worth a pretty penny.
dad, it's not going to happen. - Well, fine.
whatever. Forget it.
I'm sorry. I just don't have the funds.
what kind of daughterwon't even help out her own fucking father?
Jesus, Dad.
look, I need some air. I'm going to go for a drive.
dad, you don't have to go.
you think I was wrong, telling him I couldn't give him the money?
of course not. - But I feel like I should help him out.
Why? - Because he's my dad.
the same dad who almost let you drown?
who left you alone in a hotel for three days?
he's trying to change.
I doubt it.
look, I know he's done some bad things, but there's good inside of him, as well.
Oh, right, you've known him for, what, 24 hours, and you think you understand him?
well, I have a sense for this sort of thing.
Oh, yeah, you and your dark--whatever-- part of you.
that you don't think exists. - Because it doesn't.
I gotta go to work. It's the arsonist again.
look, I'm just trying to help here.
I know. I know. I appreciate it. I'm sorry.
I'll be fine. Go.
okay.
another "Bobby."
"it's Bobby." He added an "it's.
like we didn't know it was Bobby.
make sure you get this.
did you see Bosso? He was sniffing the body.
probably for accelerant.
still, it was kind of creepy, right?
I mean, I know it would be the biggest cliche in the world, the arson investigator turned out to be the arsonist, but does he--does he set off anything in your lizard brain?
I don't think Bosso's the phantom.
he has an alibi.
you vetted him? - I looked into him.
you said you weren't going to takeany more cases from the police.
I didn't take it. - Fuck, Dexter. Why would you put yourself in that situation?
good question. Why did I?
Hey, L.T. We got the security camera.
I'm going to take the hard drive back down to the stationand see if we can get eyes on the phantom.
good. We could use a break.
Hey, Hannah.
wait, hold on. Slow down. What happened?
I'll be right there.
what happened?
I came back from the Flower Mart, and it was like this.
Oops.
well, I had a couple of drinks to take the edge off, but I guess I might have overdone it a little.
you did this to get back at mefor not giving you the money that you wanted.
Oh, talk about paranoid. But then, maybe you've got reason to be.
must be a whole lot of folks hate youfor all the pain you've caused.
how can you even say that to me?
playing mother nature in herewith your stupid, little flowers, won't even help out your own fucking father!
because I don't want to help you!
you got any idea what it's like to be the father of the infamous Hannah McKay?
you're a goddamn curse, you ungrateful little shit!
that's enough, Clint. - You stay out of this. This is family business.
you know you killed your mother, don't you?
she died of a broken heartafter your spree with Wayne Randall.
I'm sorry.
everybody would have been a lot better offif I'd let you drownthat day at the pond.
get out of here.
now.
fine.
I said what I had to say.
well, it looks like Hannah's found herself another winner.
you two deserve each other.
I can cut a body up into pieces, but how do I help Hannah put herself back together?
could you have picked more of a dump?
come on, Maria. It's perfect for all this cloak and dagger bullshit.
it's the kind of place you take hookers and ugly broads.
and also, nobody sees you.
you should know, I followed upon all the names you identified on my list.
Yes, the list of suspicious police employeeswho own boats.
Yes. They were all dead ends.
all except for Dexter Morgan, who conveniently moved his boat right when we were closing in on his marina during the official Bay Harbor Butcher investigation.
you really think Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher?
it's worth looking into. - No, it's a waste of time.
now, look, you have to start thinking logically.
if Doakes really wasn't the Bay Harbor Butcher, - then that means that somebody probably framed him. - Right.
which means that same person probably killed him, most likely the real Bay Harbor Butcher.
so the best thing to do is to lookinto Doakes' final days.
we should start with the cabin in the Everglades.
where Doakes died.
makes sense. First let's eat.
okay. - Waiter.
you went all out.
well, you had a rough night. I figured you could use a pick-me-up.
sit.
you were right about my dad.
I'm sorry I was.
I just-- I feel like such a sucker.
you know, I don't fall for anybody's bullshit, but when it comes to him, I
I get it. Fathers can be complicated.
I just don't understand why I keep holding on to this ideathat, underneath it all, he's a good person.
maybe because the idea that he's notis just too hard to take.
well, I just hope he's gone for good.
you sure scared the shit out of him.
that voice
I hadn't seen that look on your facesince you took me to see the snow.
is that what you were talking about?
your dark rider?
dark passenger.
okay, fine. It sounds a little silly when you say it out loud.
no, I-I get what you mean, you know. You do seem like a different person, so it makes sense that you would name that part of yourself.
does it just take over?
where do you go?
does Dexter Morgan just disappear?
no, I'm still there.
do you hear a voice, or -Not exactly.
it's more like a need.
so it's just like a feeling.
well, I should get to work.
unless you need me to -No, I'm good.
I got pancakes.
okay, the good news is that we havethe phantom entering the bus.
the bad news is that he never shows his face.
my promise to Deb is getting harder and harder to keep.
this is more than just a feeling.
there's no way to I. D. him? - I didn't say that.
right there.
he grabs a rail bare-handed. We might have a print.
pull the fucking print off the rail, and we might get lucky and get a match.
all right. Let's go, bro.
Hey, baby. What's up? What?
motherfuck. I'll be right there.
what's wrong? - Fucking Novikov's sending Nadiato work at a sex club in Dubai.
he's holding her at the Fox Hole. I gotta get her out of there.
you're going alone? - I got no choice. He's putting her on a flight tonight.
you're going to need backup. Let's go.
where do you think you're going? - I'm here to see George.
why don't you stay here?
well, well, if it isn't Sir Lancelot.
Where's Nadia? - Nadia?
let me go get her for you. She's got something to tell you.
get over here.
all right, tell your boyfriend who you belong to.
let her go.
tell him. - Fuck you.
you touch her a-fucking-gain, you're dead.
Oh, what are you going to do, Mr. Policeman?
you're going to shoot me in my own club?
- Fuck.
don't move.
Nadia, get behind George's body.
I want you to take this gun, Nadia
I want you to shoot me in the arm. Okay, sweetie?
it's okay.
shoot me in the arm.
what the hell-- are you okay?
I'm fine. He pulled a gun and shot me. I had no fucking choice.
he just grazed me.
Christ. - Go to the safe.
get your passport and the money and go.
what? She's a witness. I'm not going to let her take that money.
she's earned it. She can't be a witness. The Koshkas will kill her.
and she's here illegally.
I'm sorry. - It's okay. Go, go, now.
so did you find a match?
we'll see. I'm running the phantom's prints through A. F.I. S. now.
nothing. - Fuck me.
so what now?
you hand the whole thing over to meand let me take care of it my way?
I can't stop thinking about this "Bobby" thing.
you know, that somehow, that's the key.
it's a kid's name. Nobody calls an adult Bobby.
he wrote "it's Bobby" on the bus.
sounds like Astor and Cody, blaming each other."It's Astor." "It's Cody."
you think the fires have something to dowith his childhood?
could be. Maybe his urges started back then.
I wish we could run that print against the juvie records, but that shit's sealed.
back to square one.
not for me.
government workers never miss a break.
there's your phantom.
arrested for burning down his school's gym at age 12.
spent some time in detention, set his roommate's bunk on fire.
got sent to a psychiatric facility in 2006.
that explains why the fires only just started now.
you going to turn that over to Deb?
call it in on the tip line?
I'm not sure I can. Deb was right.
now that I have proof, my urges are beyond my control.
your dark passenger. Where did you come up with that, anyway?
I thought I got it from you.
I gave you the code.
the dark passenger was all yours.
you said it got into me too early, in that shipping container.
like you thought I was possessed.
I meant you were traumatized, Dexter. Not possessed.
I remember the first time you said it. You must have been about 12.
I just let it go.
I couldn't let you blame yourself for feelings that were too complicated for a young boy to understand.
but you're not a boy anymore.
you sound like Hannah. - Maybe she's right.
maybe the dark passenger is just a feeling.
it can't be. - Why?
because if there's no dark passenger, then I'm responsible for everything I've done.
it sure is a whole lot simpler to just pin all the blameon something else, isn't it, Dexter?
it's much scarier to think that the dark passenger is no more real than I am.
this is where the cabin used to be.
Yeah, before it got blown to smithereens.
I'm Captain Maria LaGuerta from Miami Metro Homicide.
this is Thomas Matthews. - What do you want?
were you the owner of this property back in 2007?
and did you rent it, at that time, to a James Doakes?
the Bay Harbor Butcher.
no, no, no, no, no. I told the cops back then, I had nothing to do with that.
then how did Mr. Doakes come to be staying here?
I was renting the place to Santos Jimenez.
some kind of Colombian drug guy.
not that I knew it at the time. I would never rent to a criminal.
of course not.
now, why does that sound so familiar?
now I know why the name Santos Jimenez rang a bell.
he wasn't just a drug runner.
he was one of the three men responsible for killing Dexter Morgan's biological mother, Laura Moser.
Moser? - Yeah.
some drug lord put a hit out on her because he found out that she was Harry Morgan's C. I.
she was butchered by Jimenez with a chain sawright in front of Dexter and his brother Brian.
the Ice Truck killer, that was Dexter's brother?
Yeah.
so that means that Dexter watched his mother get chopped up, just like the Bay Harbor Butcher chopped up his victims?
so what are you saying?
Where's Jimenez now? - He disappeared.
murdered by the Bay Harbor Butcher? - Maybe.
so who was more likely to want Jimenez dead, Doakes or Dexter?
Oh, come on, Maria. - No, Tom.
we can't ignore the facts.
the Bay Harbor Butcher took blood slides from his victims.
Dexter is a blood spatter analyst.
and Doakes always thoughtthere was something off about Dexter.
what if Doakes was on to him?
Jesus. What if Dexter is the real Bay Harbor Butcher?
what if he isn't?
I am going to go question him.
no, no, no. You're not going to do that.
now, I don't think you're right about this.
trust me, I hope I'm not.
if somebody's got to talk to Dexter, it's going to be me.
I've known him since he was a kid. He trusts me.
what's more, I'm a lot less likely to fuck it up.
the only thing that stands between meand killing the phantomis a slightly deflated water wing.
you sure we can't talk you into coming for a swim?
Yeah, I'd love to, but I got something I gotta take care of.
here, put your hand through there.
boom.
do this one too.
- There you go.
well, well. Who's this big fella?
that's my son, Harrison.
Harrison. Isn't that fancy?
and who are you?
I'm Jamie, Harrison's nanny.
boy. They didn't have nannies like you back in my day.
we're going to go swimming now.
you ready? Ready, little man?
boy, the way they coddle kids today.
you know, they're all going to be expecting a helping hand.
the world isn't like that. It's sink or swim, Sonny boy.
have fun.
what do you want?
well, Dexter, I can tell that you care about my daughter.
I'm just here to find out how much. - Get to the point.
I have some informationthat could be very damaging to Hannah.
now, I could givethis information to the police, or you could pay me a nice, tidy sumto keep it to myself.
what are you talking about?
when Hannah got out of juvie, she killed a counselor at a halfway house.
she fed him rat poison.
her roommate, little gal named Arlene Shram, saw her do it with her own two eyes.
I figured the cops could get her to spill her guts.
you're lying.
I read Sal Price's book on Hannah.
he mentioned the counselor but nothing about the roommate.
because I hadn't told him about it yet. - What?
where do you think he was gettingall those juicy, little plums?
price was paying me to dish dirt on my daughter.
but I was saving the good stuff for a bigger payday.
then the son of a bitch went belly-up, and. pfft.
there went my meal ticket.
you'd sell your own daughter outfor a crawfish farm?
fuck crawfish, man. I'm up to my ears in gambling debt.
but you do what you gotta do.
so you going to give me my money, or do I send Hannah to jail?
get out of here before you see my bad side.
you might want to ask Hannah about Arlenebefore you come to a final decision.
then we'll talk numbers.
what exactly were you doing here?
it was a personal matter.
my girlfriend works at the club.
Jesus, Quinn.
I came here to talk to Novikov about Nadia. The conversation got heated.
he pulled out a gun and shot me. I returned fire. Self-defense.
plain and simple. - Well, write up a report.
I want it on my desk in the morning.
there's a little problem with your story.
there was a time lag between the first shot and the second.
I want the truth.
I told you the truth.
I went down when George shot me.
he started to beat the shit out of Nadia.
I reached for my gun.
he wheeled around, ready to blow my head off, and I took him out.
that's what happened.
okay. Then we'll go with that.
minus Nadia.
Hey. Where's Dexter?
I don't know.
but I'd like to point out the factthat I am here, doing my duty.
what? - Nothing.
I feel like I'm going to be sick.
how can that be my own father?
I'm sorry to have to tell you all this, but I needed to know that he was telling the truth.
Arlene Shram is the only personwho can put me in jail.
she saw me put poison in that counselor's food.
I'm going to have to pay him.
that's not going to solve anything. He's just going to come back.
well, I don't see any other option.
when other people have threatened you, you've found other options.
I can't.
he's my father.
I'm going to call my bank.
I know what you're thinking.
I'm not thinking anything.
Clint McKay doesn't meet the code.
but Joseph Jensen does.
it's not as much funwhen you're not wearing your suit, is it?
Who-who are you? I can't see you.
maybe I'm a phantom.
then again, maybe not.
a phantom can't hurt you.
Oh, God. Please don't.
who's Bobby? - Let me go.
stop whining. Who's Bobby?
Bobby Hamilton, my best friend when I was 12.
that's when you set your first fire.
I didn't set it. Bobby did.
it was all his idea.
but then he died, and I got caught.
they sent me to the nuthouse, like I was crazy.
it's all because of Bobby. Fucking asshole.
so does he still talk to you?
is Bobby the one telling you to set these fires?
no, that would make me crazy, and I'm not fucking crazy!
but I only hurt people because of Bobby.
no, you're the one who's setting those fires.
you're the one who's burning people alive.
you can't blame it on somethingthat happened to you when you were a kid.
you're not a kid anymore.
it's time for you to take responsibility.
fuck.
the caller said they smelled kerosene.
looks like we have the right place.
holy shit.
that's Joe Jensen. I interviewed this guy.
dumb fuck must have passed out from the fumes.
he's still alive.
I guess we found our phantom.
who'd have thought it would be so easy?
Yeah.
guys, come on down.
got your call.
glad you came to your senses.
you got my money? - Yeah.
it's right back here.
what's with all the plastic?
you'll find out soon.
what the hell?
I realize this isn't the best wayto make a good impression on your girlfriend's father.
but I can't allow you to hurt Hannah.
Oh, please. I won't talk to the cops.
I'll leave town. I promise, I'll never come near Hannah again.
I wish I could believe you.
actually, I don't,'cause then, I couldn't kill you.
Oh, please, you don't have to do this.
that's what I'm realizing.
I don't have to. But I want to.
even though you don't meet my code, I really, really want to.
because, unlike you, I care about Hannah.
you got the devil inside you, boy.
no, I think it's just me.
sink or swim, daddy.
Hey, Deb. - We arrested the phantom, thanks to you.
now I know why you weren't at the Fox Hole.
consider it a gift.
bullshit.
you want something in return.
and I'm guessing it's for me to lay off your girlfriend.
well, now that you mention it.
forget it.
I always give in to you.
but not anymore.
I understand.
I got the money for my dad.
I left him a message. He should be here soon.
he won't be coming. - How do you know?
I had a talk with him.
I made it clearthat I wouldn't allow him to hurt you anymore.
and I think he understood.
so he's gone?
he won't be bothering you again.
thank you.
the dark passenger has been with meever since I can remember, pulling the strings, running the show.
but as it turns out, I'm no puppet.
and you should know, you were right.
about what?
the dark.
rider.
he doesn't exist.
turns out, maybe you understand mea little better than I understand myself.
I love you.
I think I love you too.
Hey. I need your help.
we need to find a woman named Arlene Shram.
sure. Who's that?
according to a message I got last nightfrom Hannah McKay's father, she's a witness to a murder.
Dahmer, Lake and NG, Debardeleben, Bardella, and others.
at the core of these criminals is a need for control.
killing was an act that provided a release "so sexually satisfying "that they were compelled to repeat the fantasy "with multiple victims again and again."
it is this continuum of violence that we will explore in deviance:
the secret desires of sadistic seal killers.
signed copies of agent David Rossi's 10th anniversary edition of his bestseller are on sale tonight.
I find your career so fascinating.
what's it like to interview serial killers?
well, it's never boring.
is that what you enjoy most about your work, looking evil right in the eye?
no, it's putting killers in jail.
you know what gets me are the wives who swear they had nclue their husband was a serial killer.
how can you be married to one and not know?
Theresa, would you mind calling up my car service?
not at all.
uh, you'll excuse me? - Sure.
agent Rossi.
I'm a big fan.
there's not gonna be a quiz. I saw you taking notes.
Oh, no, it's just for my own edification.
agent Rossi, are you or anyone in your department investigating the recent spike in homicides in Cleveland?
not that I'm aware of.
there's been an uptick in homicides by 11% this quarter.
the average uptick hasn't surpassed 5% in the past 10 years in Cleveland.
I'm guessing you're studying criminology.
I am.
sir, I think there's a serial killer here.
well, have the police issued a statement to corroborate that?
I filed an inquiry downtown.
um, nobody's called me back.
but, uh, I know that the coroner's office hasn't been as busy since,
like, the Butcher of Kingsbury Run in the 1930s.
well, what kind of homicides are we talking about here?
OK, um...
a man was shot in a park, a prostitute was found with her throat slashed,
a couple was found shot in their car, a woman was killed in a burglary.
do you know what 3 things profilers look at to link serial crimes?
victimology, modus operandi, and signature. - Good.
so were the victims similar? - No.
was the m.o.consistent? - no was the signature consistent?
not that I know of.
then there's no obvious reason to suggest that the spike in violence was due to a serial killer.
I see your point, sir, but I really
you're bright.
you obviously have a passion for this, and the bureau is always looking for good people.
so if you get a reply from the police, or even for career advice, I'm available.
OK, thanks. It was an honor to meet you.
keep studying, and don't stop until you find all the answers you're looking for.
I won't.
excuse me.
get back! Get back!
it's ok. Look, I'm not gonna hurt you, ok?
I live in the neighborhood.
what's your address?
817 tivoli. It's right down that way.
look, if I was gonna hurt you, I wouldn't have said "excuse me." Ok?
are we cool?
what the hell, man? You scared me.
I'm--I'm sorry.
what are you doing here?
I was just walking home from the liquor store and I saw you snooping around.
what about you?
so you heard what happened here?
Yeah. Poor woman.
all the neighbors are freaking out.
I can't believe I didn't even know her name.
she was raped, too.
can't believe this happened on my street.
no, it's not just your street.
there's been a lot of murders lately.
Really?
Yeah, it's uncharacteristically high for our city.
you with the police or something?
I'm just investigating a few cases.
gosh, all of a sudden, all these random, violent murders something weird is going on here.
what do you mean by weird?
agent Rossi.
Yes.
I'll be right down.
agent Rossi?
I'm detective Dan Brady.
we found your card on the victim.
any idea what happened here?
Albert Einstein.
she was found by a woman walking her dog this morning.
dog wouldn't stop barking.
I just talked to her last night.
I never asked her name.
that's her car right there.
these keys were still in her pocket.
car alarm was still activated. There was no sign of a break-in.
she had pepper spray but didn't use it?
I don't know, maybe she didn't get the chance.
nobody saw or heard anything? - No.
we went door to door. There were no witnesses.
there was blunt-force trauma to her head, signs of strangulation.
murderer asphyxiated her with the scarf she was wearing. Do you have any idea? What she was doing snooping around this case?
you keep talking like I know something. What case?
the resident of this house, Kayla James, was murdered and raped 3 days ago in a burglary-homicide.
I think there's a serial killer here.
and don't stop until you find all the answers you're looking for.
I won't.
this is Henry wearing the booties my mom knitted him.
I can't get over his cuteness.
Oh, and this is him wearing the customized leather jacket auntie Penelope got him.
when he grows up, he's gonna be a rebel.
is this David Rossi, the famous bestselling author David Rossi?
what are you doing? You're not supposed to be calling
I think my a. l. just ended.
what do you mean?
Garcia, Cleveland police is sending you some files.
get JJ to distribute them to the team right away. - Yeah.
what are we looking at?
I don't know yet.
just see if the team can find a connection with these crimes.
I'll call you back in a few hours.
Yes, sir.
she had a notebook with her last night.
I saw one in her car.
can I take a look?
it may be evidence, but I don't see why not.
have you been to her house yet?
I'm headed there now.
I have to notify the next of kin.
now, if you get a reply from the police, or even for career advice, I'm available.
Thanks. It was an honor to meet you.
Sheila Hawkes? - Yeah.
I'm, uh, detective Brady with the Cleveland police department. This is agent Rossi with the FBI.
may we come in? - Why ?
it's about your daughter.
That--that's--that's one of her journals. Has something happened?
Yes. She was murdered.
I am so sorry. Mrs. Hawkes.
Oh, no! No, where did you find her?
she was in a house in east Cleveland.
we think she may have been visiting a crime scene.
God...
I told her to stop doing that.
I told her that was too dangerous.
Where--where is she now?
she's at the coroner's office, and I can take you to see her when you're ready.
now. - Ok.
right now. I have to go right now.
Mrs. Hawkes, would you mind if I stayed behind to look in her room?
she was so excited to meet you. You're like a...
a hero to her.
Mrs. Hawkes. Let me take you downtown now.
come on.
I'll, uh, I'll send a car for you.
the crimes are within a 7-mile radius.
well, that's something.
Yeah, but the neighborhoods are all completely different.
they range from poor to rich, industrial to residential.
the physical locations are dissimilar, but the operating zone's well-defined.
OK. I'm in.
I see you.
in your web browser for search history.
check out her home page.
all right, so the first thing she looks at probably to stay current on her studies.
can you see what she worked on last?
voila. These are the most recently opened documents she created.
looks like she was compiling empirical data about homicide trends in Cleveland.
do you think she knew the killer?
I don't see any notes indicating suspects.
well, Dave, she's a criminology student.
she's been taught to analyze statistics and apply theory, not investigate killers.
let's talk about what we know.
all right. Victim one-- Travis Bartlett was last seen at a gay bar.
he was shot at night in a park.
victim 2, Lily Nicks, a 34-year-old prostitute, her throat was slashed.
victims 3 and 4, June Appleby and Troy Wertsler,
were shot in their car at a parking lot outside of a movie theater.
and victim 5 was a 28-year-old single woman, Kayla James, killed in her home.
she was bound, suffocated with a bag over her head, evidence of rape.
and then the sixth victim was Zoe.
victimology, weapons used, and c. o.d. are all different.
it's hard to imagine it's even the same unsub.
it can't be a coincidence that Zoe goes to Kayla James' house and gets murdered.
all right, let's say it is the same killer.
does anybody see a pattern?
well, maybe.
OK, the first crime, he shoots the victim.
the second crime, he rapes a woman and slashes her throat.
that's more personal.
and the third crime, he escalates to killing two people,
and the fourth, he escalates even more by raping a woman, binding her, and suffocating her.
so if it is the same unsub, you could argue that there's a progression of violence with every kill.
it could be an anger excitation offender getting more daring with each crime.
I think I got something here. Look the slashes in the prostitute's throat
they're all shallow, unsure cuts.
the kayla James crime scene-- telephone cord, rope, and duct tape were used.
it like he couldn't decide how to bind her.
so without a gun, he's sloppy, inexperienced.
the young couple shot in the car...
that crime scene remind you of anything?
Yeah, they were shot with a . 44 bulldog, just like the Son of Sam used on his victims, which were also young couples in parked cars.
it might be nothing, but you're right, there is a parallel there.
with the second victim, it's hard not to think of Jack the Ripper.
the obvious similarity being it's a prostitute whose throat was slashed.
Kayla James was bound, tortured, raped, with a plastic bag over her head like BTK.
what about victim number one?
Garcia, what neighborhood was he found in?
at a park in the Kingsbury Run area.
Zoe reminded me last night that Cleveland's most famous serial killer was the Butcher of Kingsbury Run.
he found his victims in gay bars, shot them, and dumped their body there.
Travis Bartlett was last seen at a gay bar, and his body was found in kingsbury park.
so these are copycats of famous serial killers?
he's a serial killer studying serial killers.
see you in Cleveland, Dave.
america's WORST SPREE KILLERS - Guys. - Hey, Dave.
we're in that room. Coffee's brewing.
we'll get started on the evidence boards.
detective Brady's our point.
I'll let you all introduce yourselves.
JJ. Can you help me out with something?
sure.
this has to be confidential.
I know it may seem farfetched, but copycat killers are not entirely uncommon.
this one happens to be copying several different killers.
but if he's trying to be the Butcher of Kingsbury Run, why didn't he cut up and mutilate the victims like the real guy?
that was 7 weeks ago.
he was just getting started.
beginning killers are often frightened of the crime itself.
they're more interested in getting it over with as quickly as possible and fleeing the scene.
he was just using the Butcher's ruse as a way to lure the victim to be alone with him.
and by the time he killed Kayla James 3 days ago, he'd progressed.
he came very close to copying all of the BTK's m. o.
he's reading, learning, borrowing from others because he doesn't know who he is yet.
and because of this, we think he's young and impressionable, maybe even a student.
someone probably enrolled in criminology classes.
our technical analyst is going through names of local students right now.
up to this point, changing his m. o. has prevented investigators from linking the crimes.
that's why we need to work quickly.
you're sure about this?
it's not a coincidence that all of these random,
violent murders in a localized area are copycats of serial killers.
it's as if all the worst serial killers have converged on Cleveland.
every time he plans to kill the murder weapon, the m. o. and the victimology will all change.
detective, will you let your team know we're ready to give a preliminary profile.
sure. I gotta go.
Hotch. I'm gonna step out for this one, clear my head.
OK.
Garcia found 3 male students enrolled in criminology classes with felony records.
good. We'll interview them.
I don't think we need to.
one of them is studying abroad, the other 2 are back in jail on other charges.
tell garcia to check enrollment in online and correspondence courses,
see if we have any luck with those parameters you guys handle the profile?
everything ok? - Everything's fine.
we have 6 homicides in a 7-mile radius in east Cleveland.
now, this small zone indicates that's he's a geographically stable offender.
this type of offender is characterized as young, socially immature,
of average intelligence, with psychopathic personality traits.
they also usually live alone and have an antisocial nature.
a serial killer's first murder is very telling.
this unsub's first murder, he chose the m. o. of Cleveland's own Butcher of Kingsbury Run.
the Butcher isn't as well known as other famous serial killers, but he is a local legend.
and because he picked the butcher to be first,
we believe he's a native of Cleveland and probably grew up hearing stories of the Butcher.
this is someone who is obsessed with serial killers.
his computer will be filled with research on them.
he'll have abundant images of murderers on his computer and possibly even snuff films.
he uses these like pornography.
these provide some sort of sexual release.
I think he went back to relive his crime.
when Zoe showed up, she became a victim of opportunity.
it's the same theory we arrived at on the plane.
he strangled her with her own scarf.
he didn't plan it. I think she surprised him.
I told her not to stop until she found the answers she was looking for.
I didn't think she would go to a crime scene.
her mom said it's something that she does all the time.
she probably would have gone anyway.
but it's because of what I said that she was encouraged to go there last night.
Dave, what are you doing?
she came to me and I dismissed her.
try not to personalize it.
I was the last one she talked to before she was murdered.
how is this not personal, Aaron?
OK. It's personal.
that doesn't change how we go about finding her killer.
we know that violent criminals develop a signature over a series of crimes
if he's young, he probably hasn't even figured out what his is yet.
find the signature, we can link the crimes.
he probably monitoring the news, seeing if the police have connected them yet.
we can use that. We can utilize the media.
and I think I know who we can talk to.
I knew homicides were up, but nobody said anything about a serial killer.
why do I get a visit from the BAU?
you're Paula Mcconnell, Cleveland's number one source in crime news.
you're detailed, you have a following. He's reading you.
we need you to write that the police have found his signature.
you can help us by explaining what his signature is in your article.
it's a killer's personal stamp, his distinctive touch that he leaves at the scene of every crime.
well, I've been doing this for 18 years.
and I know what a signature is, honey.
we just really need you to be detailed about this.
we're speaking directly to him.
through my column.
he's doing something, a behavioral impulse he feels compelled to do.
but a need-driven act to get a sexual release that's specific to his psyche.
this repetitive behavior at each crime scene will lead us to him.
let me take a stab at it.
Yeah, Reid.
uh, they just found another body.
they're bringing him up right now.
teenagers found him a little over an hour ago.
it's petechiae in the whites of his eyes.
judging from the bruising, he was probably strangled with a wire.
is this our guy?
it's gotta be. A jogger doesn't get garroted every day.
whatever signature he left was probably washed away in the water.
well, who's he mimicking now?
bike Path Rapist Altemio Sanchez comes to mind.
he trolled bike paths near Buffalo garroting his victims.
it looks like he copied everything except for the rape.
strangulation's a repetition of his last murder of Zoe.
first time he's repeated himself.
Zoe's murder was spontaneous, though. He didn't plan it.
he acted on instinct and did what came naturally to him.
maybe what came naturally felt good him and he wanted to feel it again
if he's starting to repeat a pattern, he may have found himself.
very good.
I'm Danny.
I want you to call us if you have any questions at all.
we're gonna take great care of her ok?
you're all set.
um, do I pay the bill here?
no, ma'am. The bill's been taken care of by an anonymous donor.
see anything else in there?
just the notations of an observant student.
I've been thinking, though.
Zoe got all of her information from the newspapers and from Paula Mcconnell's column.
there's no way she could have known about every homicide in the city.
well, not every homicide's reported in the papers.
so how do we know the unsub didn't commit more murders than the ones noted in her journals?
we don't.
we can check missing persons and see if anyone was last seen in the unsub's operating zone.
what?
well, a young person's mind is so active-- yours, zoe's, and I imagine this unsub's, too.
I think when he get him, he'll be curious.
he'll ask questions.
Rossi, heads up. She knows.
did you do this?
I don't need or want your money.
I have taken care of my daughter for 22 years, and she is still my responsibility.
I don't need any help from you.
you didn't even know her.
I'm sorry if I've offended you.
just leave us alone.
all right.
we found another body. East cleveland.
strangulation marks.
this was recent.
the bruises on her neck are still reddish.
no other obvious signs of trauma.
well, this isn't a bike path like the last one.
which serial killer is he mimicking now?
I don't think he is mimicking anymore.
he's starting to show consistency.
I think he's developing his own style.
has anybody touched her?
no. They have instructions to wait for us and the m. e.
Where's he? - Dr. Edwards!
here he comes.
agent Hotchner.
um, could you take a look at this spot on her forehead?
that's strange.
let me swab it and get it back to the lab. - Thx. 3 murders in the last 3 days. Something's causing his frenzy.
could be a drastic change in his life.
something he lost control of.
or it could be something he gained control of. Like himself.
if he finally defined himself as a strangler, he may just be practicing, perfecting his style.
he may have awakened.
the coroner just called.
preliminary tests confirm acetyl alcohol on the homeless woman's forehead.
he sterilized it?
why would he do that?
maybe he did something to her forehead, used an alcohol wipe to remove evidence.
well, if that's the case, it certainly wasn't necessary to the crime.
this could be part of his signature.
we should look at other victims to see if he did something similar.
any evidence on the last victim was washed away in the water.
and all the other bodies were either buried or cremated.
except for one.
I know you don't want to see me, but please hear me out.
we need Zoe's body to go back to the coroner's office.
Zoe's murderer left a clue on her body.
there's a chance we can find him from this clue, but we have to examine her again.
all I want to do is put her to rest.
Zoe chose to study criminology because she believed in bringing criminals to justice.
can't guarantee the evidence hasn't been compromised.
the mortician hadn't touched her yet.
even so, she's been transported more times than I'd like.
don't want anyone to get their hopes up.
just make sure the evidence gets to Quantico quickly.
january 22--prostitute murder, downtown at 5th and main.
january 9--man shot at kingsbury park.
february 15--kayla James. Lived alone. First home invasion...
february 8--murder... Young couple shot in park.
no apparent motive. Investigate.
why are locations different?
page 47, Rossi's book: there are no coincidences.
Garcia, you got something?
Yeah, the boys in the lab found trace amounts of saliva on Zoe's forehead, enough for a DNA sample.
so we got a codis match on Eric Ryan Olson, 23, Cleveland native,
did 2 1/2 years for attempted sexual assault and was paroled 6 months ago.
we thought for sure he'd be a student.
uh, that's cause he was.
while he was in the slammer, he took independent correspondence classes in forensic science
and criminology from an out-of-state school.
call the team. Let's get a search warrant. - Yeah.
clear! Clear!
Reid, check the computer.
detective, we should talk to the neighbors, find out where he goes. - Where he might be on a week night. - Aaron.
he's reading my books.
Reid, anything?
Al's alehouse. That's like 5 miles away.
it's on the schedule for tonight.
have a good night. - See you tomorrow.
he was alone at the bar. - When did he leave?
like 10 minutes ago. - Did he talk to anyone?
Linda, he left right after she did.
Thanks.
got it, hotch.
manager says he may have followed one of the waitresses out of the bar.
she walks home through cedar park.
we just passed cedar park. FBI! Get off the girl! Get off the girl!
OK, it's ok. - Stay down! Stay down!
get off me. -it's all right. Wait, wait, wait.
stop! We're trying to help you.
didn't see that coming.
how could she not know?
kenneth Bianchi's girlfriend had no idea he was one of the Hillside Stranglers.
just like BTK's wife.
what do we know about her?
her name's Linda Jones.
no criminal record. They met online 6 weeks ago.
no, he can't be this guy.
we found his DNA on a murder victim.
what?
we also think he's responsible for the murder of 7 other people over the last 7 weeks.
two of his victims were raped.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
OK, ok.
against my counsel, my client would like to talk to agent Rossi.
we talked about him being curious, asking questions.
if he thinks he knows you, he might open up.
I'll keep him talking. - Good.
agent Rossi. Big fan.
we have some information that would be of great interest to you.
my ears are burning.
my lawyer here explains that I'm being charged with 8 murders
and that I'm probably looking at the death penalty.
I have one very important question for you.
are you sure it's just 8?
what?
we checked missing persons.
since he started killing, 4 people have been reported missing in east Cleveland neighborhoods.
we can't rule out any of them as his possible victims.
he marked pages on several serial killers.
we don't know which one he tried to copycat.
we're screwed, then.
the D. A. is gonna have to offer him a deal.
the D. A. doesn't have to give him the option.
that's easy for you to say. You get to go home tomorrow.
what do I tell the families of the missing? Sorry, no idea?
detective, we're not gonna leave until we can give you and the families some closure.
and how are you gonna do that?
I need something, anything that might show where he was trolling for more victims.
once the D. A.gets here, we have a lot to talk about.
what do you think you're gonna get out of this?
I don't know. We'll see.
you don't have to say anything else, Eric.
you got to speak to him.
now let's just wait for the D. A.
I don't know how to break it to you, kid, but you don't have a card to play here.
we're 3 steps ahead of you.
really.
we've already considered the possibility that you killed other people.
we knew you were young, wanted to experiment.
it was likely you would copycat as many serial killers as possible to figure out who you are and what you liked.
so let me ask you a question.
how do you know you haven't told me already where the other bodies are buried?
we've been through everything.
he marked up Rossi's books. Check the bookcase.
maybe he was scouting for locations to commit more murders.
pictures. - What?
framed photographs in his hallway. Nothing else...
nothing else is framed. They look like originals.
let me call you right back, Hotch. - Ok.
I need to ask you about your sex life.
that's personal.
your boyfriend's a serial killer.
your relationship is no longer private.
I-it's completely normal to experiment with sex.
OK. It might be normal to have sex in a public park, but the other things?
we were just role-playing.
every couple has fantasies. Did you ever think it was strange that your boyfriend has fantasies about strangling and raping women?
not women. Just me.
did he... kiss you on the forehead, too?
how did you know that?
now, were you sick much as a kid?
I got strep throat every flu season.
did you just profile that about me?
her name was Zoe Hawkes-- the girl you killed 3 days ago.
we found your DNA on her forehead.
it'll never be admissible in court.
her body was removed from a state facility and now, most people would ask what you did.
I know what you did.
you kissed her on the forehead.
what I what to know is, why?
why do you think someone would do that, agent Rossi?
well, that's why I asked if you had been ill much as a child.
you see, you're slight, pale, sickly.
most parents, they kiss their children on the forehead to see if their temperature is warm.
now, my theory is that you, somehow in your development,
warped that caring gesture into something perverse.
so, did you sit next to zoe to see if she got cold?
is that why you kissed her?
that's a really interesting theory.
make a great chapter in one of your books.
Yeah, Reid.
I found pictures on his computer in a special folder he created.
they're scenic places in the city.
3 of them I recognize from his crime scenes.
there are more pictures of places I don't recognize.
email them as soon as you can. - All right.
this guys getting off on those photos.
then what does he need Linda for?
did he have any other strange preferences in bed?
no.
did he ever role play by tying you up?
no - are you sure? - Yes.
I'm sure.
it was really the only way he could get excited.
what do you mean?
well, he didn't... like... having sex in bed.
so he just took me to public places.
where?
do I have to tell you this?
please. - Ok.
the first time was...
at Kingsbury Park.
and then...
at a movie theater.
in the parking lot, in my car.
did he ever take you to the second street bridge, off the bike path?
Yeag, that's where the jogger was killed.
he can only have sex with Linda when he's revisiting his crimes.
if that's the case, what were they doing in the park where we picked them up?
I need you to write down for me all the places he took you to have sex.
the D. A.'s not gonna need to negotiate a deal with you.
cedar park, Edgewater Channel, Cuyahoga Valley Park, Euclid Creek.
we'll send units in the morning to search for the bodies.
how'd you find out?
is it something that I did?
you needed to revisit the crime scenes because it was the only way for you to get a gratifying sexual release.
but revisiting the scenes wasn't enough.
you had to capture it on film, put it on your computer,
display it on your wall, so you could look at it every day.
Eric, we should talk privately.
this isn't over.
I always knew i'd end up back in prison.
just a matter of when.
you can come interview me if you want.
I read in one of your books that's how you built your behavioral database, right?
maybe you can learn something from me.
I got a lot of questions myself.
I'll be honest with you if you're honest with me.
cause the one thing that you always ask is the one that I don't understand.
Why?
I have no idea why.
I see a guy walking down the street with a stupid look on his face
and I want to bash him over the head with a bottle.
to me that's normal.
it's weird to me that no one else feels that way.
it's all I think about.
I can't stop.
this is not up for debate.
cancel the rest of the dates.
is everything ok?
why do people want to hear me talk about serial killers?
is it that entertaining?
there's a public fascination with them.
sometimes I wonder if my books are doing more harm than good.
my senior year at Georgetown...
I was graduating, I did not have a clue what I was gonna do with my life.
and one day I was in the campus bookstore and you were there,
promoting your second book. I sat through your whole talk.
you never told me.
I asked you what it was you were most proud of,
and you showed us a picture of a boy from Charleston.
brent Roberts. A neighbor took him.
he was found alive. One of the few.
that night, I bought your book, applied to the academythe next fall.
I'll see you at the airport.
austrian novelist Marie Von Ebner-Eschenbach wrote:
in youth we learn. In age we understand.
I hear you caught him.
we did.
is he going to prison?
for the rest of his life.
it doesn't make me feel better.
he's alive, Zoe's not.
but she'd be pleased that you caught him.
I hope so.
atlanta, GEORGIA
Jessica: Are you coming?
how can I help you?
text Jessica.
OK. What would you like to say to Jessica?
on my way. Don't leave without me.
your text to Jessica says:
"on highway. Car keys and tai chi." Ready to send it?
cancel. Cancel.
cancel.
text Jessica.
OK. What would you like to say to Jessica?
I am almost there. Period.
are you ready to go? Period
uh, question mark! Your text to Jessica says:
lost my hair. Are you ready to go on your period?
ready to send it?
No! No.
5 minutes away.
Hey, buddy!
Hey! Come on. Get out of the road!
Hey, get out of the street, man.
come on, there's-- come on, you gotta be careful, man.
there's cars comin'. Come on.
Hey. Get off me!
slow down, slow down! Get out of the road!
I know. There's a guy running across the street.
Hey, no, no, wait! Hey, come back.
come back, wait! Get them off me!
get them off me! Get them off me!
wait!
bone up on your manners and your vitamin C deficiencies, crime tigers, because we are going to the peachtree capital of America, Atlanta, Georgia.
what's in Atlanta?
local P. D. has invited us in for an equivocal death investigation.
this is Albert Stillman. He is an investigative journalist for a local paper.
3 days ago he disappeared on his way to talk to a source for a story, and last night he was killed wandering into traffic.
wait. Equivocal death means we help determine homicide versus suicide, right?
or death by misadventure.
my point. So what happened to Mr. Stillman was tragic, but what's to equivocate?
I mean, he had some sort of mental break, end of story.
except that he had no history of mental illness. Could this have been drug induced?
maybe. One of his most recent stories was an expose on an inner city drug ring, and he received death threats for that one. Dealers wouldn't let him loose in traffic, though.
if somebody wanted him killed, why not just shoot him?
we have to reconstruct his life to answer that question.
reporters like Stillman don't just snap. Something or someone drove him insane.
if you didn't put it there, who would, then?
somebody else did. You have the wrong guy.
if you didn't do it, who did it?! You have the wrong guy.
who did it, Albert? I don't know.
who did it? You want me to be...
why don't you let me go?
is that what you want? No, I don't. Come on
you see it. You see it. You know.
why don't you let me go. You know. You know.
you see it, don't you? I'm bleeding.
I'll go with you if I don't , ok?
it's right here. This is where it goes. See it?
answer the question. You see it. You see it.
no, I don't see it. I don't see it.
I don't see anything.
please, let me go.
Ohh! What is it? What is it?
dear God! It's
it's--it's-- I see it.
I see it! I see it! I see it!
I see it! I see it!
"what's the matter, you dissentious rogues, that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourself scabs?"

mob Organizations Have Their Hands Up the Skirts of Strip Clubs
you can see why Albert Stillman was nominated for awards.
he wrote pieces on homeless children, police corruption, bankrolling local strip clubs.
my kind of muckraker. Fights for the little guy.
those are also the kind of stories that put him in harm's way, though.
any one of them could have gotten him killed.
it doesn't fit this M. O. though.
we need to consider the likelihood that there is no unsub, that whatever happened to Stillman could have just been an accident.
what do we know about the source he was going to see the night he disappeared?
oy, I have an update on that, mademoiselle.
I have been talking and working with Atlanta P. D.'s perfectly lovely I. T. expert.
"perfectly lovely" is code for not as good as you, right, baby girl?
moi, throw shade? Never.
let's just say with a lot of my help, we've managed to narrow down the possibilities to a throwaway cell that called him hours before his disappearance.
so it's a dead end, then. Yeah, and not the only one.
Stillman's editor has dealt us an "Aw, come on" surprise by filing an injunction to halt the autopsy of the recently deceased body.
but we have jurisdiction here. That's pointless.
and suspicious. Thanks, Garcia.
all right, when we land, Kate and I will go talk to the editor, find out what he's hiding.
Dave, you and Morgan re-interview the witness who tried to save Stillman's life.
and Reid and JJ, let's move forward with the M. E.
we're not going to let an injunction stop the investigation.
atlanta POLICE DEPARTMENT
so... Thanks.
did he say anything else to you besides "get off me"?
no, he just--just kind of screamed it over and over and over.
what else was he doing? I don't know, man, the guy was a schizo.
OK, I hear you. But any details you can give us about what he was saying or how he was saying it might help us figure out what happened to him.
the whole time, he was... hitting the air.
like he was fighting someone?
Yeah. Except I don't think it was someone, I think it was something.
a lot of somethings, because right before he...
you know... He looked right at me and he said...
get them off me!
them.
you think he said "get them off me"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so. What do you think it was?
I don't know.
but it couldn't have been good.
agents, I appreciate you coming down here, but I have nothing to say to you about the injunction.
a newspaper editor telling the FBI "no comment."
that's ironic. I think we're done here.
no, sir, we're not. This is a pointless exercise.
tomorrow we'll be back with a warrant and we'll get the answers we came for.
unless that's the point. Waste our time and buy some more of your own.
time? To do what?
get ahead of the story. One of your own is dead. That reflects badly on you.
Albert Stillman deserves some privacy.
he was my friend. Then cooperate.
because if a friend of mine died the way yours did,
I wouldn't rest until I got to the bottom of it.
his behavior seemed like a psychosis from binge methamphetamine or cocaine use.
go the other direction.
benzos. Downers.
for his back. And when he couldn't get any more,
I tried to get it for him, but by then he wasn't interested.
cause he'd moved on to something cheaper, like street heroin.
that's why I filed the injunction.
I didn't want you or the police to look at a toxicology report and write him off as another junkie.
I think there's more to it than that. Yeah, so do we.
what do you know about the source he was going to meet?
not much. All he told me, he was writing a piece on, uh, vaccinations.
I'd like to see his notes. He kept it all up here.
said it was the one hard drive nobody could hack or subpoena.
so whatever that last story was, it died with him.
how we doing, beautiful? My perfectly coiffed eyebrows furrowed in concern.
do you know that throwaway cell phone that called Albert Stillman?
Yeah.
it made another call this morning to a Dr. William Suri.
he is a research scientist in entomology, of all things.
baby girl, hold on a second.
12th PRECINCT CASE# VICTIM LOCATION DIVISION ASSIGNED STATUS
this guy work at Barnett College? I know you guys are psychic, but how did you do that?
they've been dealing with some college incident all morning.
I'll call you back.
officer. The incident at the college-- what do we know?
all we got is there was a fight in the research lab, but nobody saw anything.
it's locked up now. Detectives are heading over. All right, we need that address.
crime SCENE DO NOT CROSS
no forced entry.
Dr. Suri let his attacker in.
this wasn't an assault, it was an abduction.
what do we know about this guy?
well, according to his assistant, he was published but controversial.
controversial. We're talking about bugs, right?
he had extreme theories on the impact humans have on insect mating habits.
this is probably the doctor's cell phone.
whoever did this made sure to leave it behind.
didn't want us tracing him through GPS because of the unsub's organization.
it also means this isn't an equivocal death investigation anymore.
this is serial.
Spence. The M. E. has something we need to see right away.
you. What are you doing to me?
what do you want? You said you wanted proof.
so you attack me? You bring me to this place?!
where are we? Do you see it?
please tell me that is not my blood.
no. No, it's mine.
don't you see anything strange about it?
I--I need to look at it under a slide, run some tests
what are you talking about? It's right there in front of you. It's black!
no, it's not. What are you talking about?
Ah! You've corrupted the sample.
how could I have corrupted the sample?!
look at me! Look what you're doing to me!
I'm tied to a chair!
now, I--I have listened to you.
I have entertained all of your theories.
but what you have described to me...
it is not possible.
it might be real to you, but that is...
that is because you are sick.
Yeah.
you're right.
let me show you what it feels like to be sick like I am!
No!
duct tape residue was found on his wrist, ankles, and neck.
so he was held against his will? Yeah.
it's the rest of it I can't explain.
the victim's own skin was found under his fingernails.
the fingernails were in turn gouged into different parts of his body.
he broke them off scratching himself?
Yeah. And kept scratching all the way down to his subcutaneous layer on his index and middle fingers.
are these track marks consistent with heroin abuse?
Oh, yeah. Tox screen came back positive, too.
when was the last time he shot up? Based on scar tissue, I'd say about a week ago.
OK, so he was kicking when the unsub held him.
one of the withdrawal symptoms of that is it feels like your skin is on fire.
you can't help but scratch. Think about this for a second.
Stillman was bound, but the unsub cut him loose.
he wanted him to scratch. That tells us this isn't torture.
if it were torture, he would have never taken the duct tape off.
what if it's an expression of his own pain?
maybe the unsub wants his victims to feel what's going on inside of him.
which is? Welts on the skin behind his ear.
some sort of external irritant the unsub introduced.
saw that, too. Lab's running tests.
I don't know, a bite, maybe?
wait--wait
wait! Wait.
what are you doing?
what are you doing, please?!
no, no, no! No, no, please don't-- please don't do this!
no, you're right! I hear you, I hear you.
please. Please. don't do this!
I beg you, please don't do this!
please think about this. You're right! Please stop it!
don't, don't, please! don't do this to me.
we can talk about this.
I want to talk about this. Please, please, don't do it!
No! Oh, no! No, stop it!
Oh, no, please!
no more, please! Please stop it!
no, no! You're right! No, stop it!
Oh, my god! No!
No! Please stop it! Please stop it!
Oh, stop it! I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!
Oh, please! Stop it!
so, we found William Suri.
Yeah. Garbage truck almost ran over him this morning.
our unsub didn't hold him as long.
then he shot him pointblank in the head. Big change in M. O.
not necessarily. He shows less signs of scratching, but the bite marks are definitely there.
so, the unsub wants this guy to itch, the good Doctor doesn't play along, bang, he ends the torture early.
I don't think this is torture for the unsub. I think it's a delusion.
can I have those tweezers? What kind of delusion?
bugs.
we need to deliver the profile.
we believe the unsub we're looking for suffers from delusional parasitosis, a condition in which the patient believes that he's being attacked or infested by bugs.
he takes his victims and covers them in insects, cockroaches specifically.
we think it's to convince his victims that they share in his condition.
is he trying to get them sick so he can kill them? Murder isn't his goal, attention is.
believe it or not, this unsub is crying out for help.
he kidnapped an investigative journalist because he wanted Albert Stillman to write a story about the bugs inside of him.
unfortunately, because Stillman was suddenly experiencing opiate withdrawal, he was already hallucinating insects, and this led to a psychotic break.
so the unsub changed tactics.
he kidnapped a controversial research scientist who he thought would be more willing to believe him.
but we think Dr. Suri recognized his condition for the mental illness that it is.
that's why he killed him so quickly.
it is important that we not label this unsub as crazy or insane to the media or press.
he's desperate to confirm his own self-diagnosis and he'll be violent towards those who don't.
and this kind of delusion goes hand in hand with conspiracy thinking.
he probably believes the bugs are part of a plot involving the government to keep him sick.
when he's alone, he'll be paranoid and disorganized.
his body will be mutilated from self-harm.
but his search for a fellow believer will give him focus and allow him to appear calm and rational.
we should be canvassing the entomology and infectious disease fields as well as reviewing hospital intake records.
this unsub has searched high and low for treatment for his condition, and we believe that he'll return to one of these locations for his next victim. Thank you.
I think that we have time for one more share.
anybody?
go ahead, Jane.
so, I went back to the dermatologist, and she again tried to tell me what my problem was.
you know, she said that it was maybe mold or static electricity.
I mean, can you think about that, that's what's going on inside my body could be
because of static electricity? Just...
and then she had the nerve to try and sell me a salve.
and when I looked to see what was inside the salve, it was St. John's wort.
I mean, really, do you think I haven't' already tried St. John's wort?
and I just... And I could see it really clearly now, you know?
it's not me. It's society.
you know? They want me to be sick.
because if I'm sick, if it's me, they can keep ignoring me.
but I won't be ignored anymore.
thank you for letting me share.
OK, why don't we stand up and join hands and end our meeting with our prayer.
Lord, grant me the wisdom to see the light...
Hi. I'm Leo.
the strength to believe the truth...
serenity with my body...
the courage to know how to...
there's an inherent contradiction in who this unsub is.
only one? All right, humor me.
this guy has a phobia of insects, right? So why subject his victims to the very thing he hates?
it's not a phobia. Well, maybe not, but the bugs disgust him.
labels are important here. The original name for this was entomophobia, which is, yes, the fear/ disgust at being bitten, being stung, or the fear of future infestation, but if you have delusional parasitosis, you believe you're already infested.
present tense, not future tense. So his worst fear has come true.
what he wants now is exposure.
he believes if society and the scientific community take him seriously, maybe he'll get relief.
Yeah, but that's impossible if it's all in his head.
the more people that tell him that, the more angry he's gonna get.
which is why he'll take solace in people who are as frustrated as he is.
guys, there's a suspect pool we've been missing all along.
I'm here for helping.
Garcia, I'm going to run through a series of debated and controversial diseases.
I want you to tell me if there are any support groups in the area.
hit me. - Fibromyalgia.
no. Chronic fatigue syndrome.
no. Recurrent Lyme disease.
negative. Morgellons?
there's a Magellan's astronomy club that meets on Tuesdays.
no, morgellons. M - o - r - g - e - l - l - o- n - s.
huh. Those vowels will get ya.
checking now.
I'll bite. What's morgellons?
it's a syndrome where sufferers believe they have disease-causing fibers under their skin.
they collect them only to later be told by dermatologists that all they've found is lint, dead skin, or their own picked scabs.
sounds like it's on the OCD spectrum.
there's a lot of overlap. There's also patients who insist the fibers are insect-like in nature.
Yeah, update. There's a morgellons group that gets together tonight, actually.
just missed then. Garcia, we need an address.
done.
JJ, you and Morgan go and see if they'll talk to us.
no, no, no, no. The drinking water.
drinking wa...
you think they put it in the drinking water?
Yeah, that's the easiest way to infect us.
that means everyone's sick. Everyone is sick.
see, but you and I, we react to it differently. Right?
we feel it differently. That's what makes us special.
so...
if it's this thing that I have... We have.
that we have...
is real-- Oh, it's very real.
how do I get people to believe us?
I was getting really close, and that's when they tried to kill me.
they tried to kill you?
when you worked at... Well, how do you live with that?
they could just come and get you anytime.
actually, I'm grateful. 'Cause whatever they did to me, it turned up the volume, ok?
it improved my intuition, my instincts.
when something's wrong, it comes out more.
while we've been sitting here, it hasn't come out once.
that tells me something. Yeah.
I haven't felt it either. See?
maybe that's the cure.
you and me.
maybe.
how bad does it get for you?
pretty bad.
do you want to see? Yeah, but...not here.
let's get out of here.
why am I not surprised that the FBI is showing up at my meetings?
look, we're just asking if you can think of anyone who might fit our profile.
Oh, I'll tell you what I think.
I think this is the same tactic that the FBI pulls over and over again.
occupy, WTO, anti-war groups, only this time, you people are really scraping the bottom of the barrel.
I'll bet that you even worked out a little shakedown speech on the way over.
Hey, weirdoes, we support your right for free assembly, but there might be a serial killer among you, so watch your back.
right? You want us scared.
you want us isolated.
that way it's easier for you to tell us morgellons is made up.
ms. Randall, we have no opinion about your condition one way or the other.
do you see this man?
his name is Albert Stillman.
and this man. Dr. William Suri.
do you see him?
this is not made up. This is real.
the man we're looking for thinks he has cockroaches inside of him.
he'd be quiet. Not demonstrative.
probably not comfortable sharing to the entire group, but very convincing one on one.
ms. Randall, do you know anyone like that?
no.
no one.
what makes you think that he would even show up here?
cause your group would listen to what he has to say, and you'd believe him.
but that doesn't mean we're like him. No, it doesn't.
but it could mean you're his next target.
you sure?
Yeah.
you ready?
OK.
I didn't want you to tense up.
no, it's ok. It's worse when you tense up.
Oh, it's perfect. Uh, can you hand me a slide?
Yeah.
OK.
all right. look.
they should be wiggling.
can you see them? Please see them.
Yeah. I see them.
thank you.
are they only in your blood?
no.
they're everywhere.
tell me again that it's real.
it's real.
can you heal me?
Yeah. I can.
where are we on the E. R. intake?
Garcia weeded out the mental health transfers.
no one fits. Our best bet is still the morgellons group.
when's their next meeting? - Next week.
it's too long to wait. We could take another shot at the leader.
there's definitely something that she was holding back.
you had thought she wouldn't rattle. She won't.
we're gonna have to find some other way in.
top of the morning, fellow leprechauns.
where did Lisa Randall go after she met with JJ and Morgan?
according to her credit card...
drugstores. 5 of them, to be precise.
and she bought a single item 5 times.
diaper rash cream. - All right, thanks. JJ, see if she'll come in and talk.
Reid, I need you to go to the drugstore.
you sleep?
I never really sleep.
Hi, Jane, honey, come on.
quick like a bunny. Oh, it's Lisa.
what the hell is she doing here? Well, she takes me to the meetings sometimes.
Hey, open this door! Open this door right now!
Hi, honey, it's me. Are you in there?
Jane, open this door!
get rid of her.
calm down. She's one of us, right?
are you in there?
don't.
I want to see who it is.
Hello? It's probably
be quiet. Yes, Agent Jareau.
Yes. Yes, I'll come down to the station.
She--she's talking to the police? Why would she talk to the police like that?
no, no, she called somebody an agent. That--that's not the police, it's the feds.
what do they want with us?
I'll take care of it. Just hold on.
ms. Randall, I'm Aaron Hotchner with the FBI.
I have already told the other agents everything that I have to say.
do you know why you itch?
well, my neurologist tried to explain it as simply as he could to me so I would stop coming to his office.
my amygdala, which is the emotional center of my brain, has hijacked my prefrontal cortex, which is the rational side.
so in times of stress, I itch.
but, look at me now.
I'm in the FBI office being questioned.
one would think that would be a very stressful thing for anyone and I'm not itching.
how old was she when she died?
excuse me? Did she make it to her third birthday?
I don't know who you talked to, but you have no right.
I haven't talked to anyone. I'm trained to see what's in front of me.
I notice that you don't wear a wedding ring under your gloves.
I think a condition like yours makes it difficult to build intimate relationships.
I know you looked everywhere for some sort of relief.
doctors' prescriptions, antihistamines. None of it worked.
nothing until you found this.
this works, doesn't it?
Yes.
someone who's not a mother doesn't stumble on a cure like that by accident.
what was her name?
she was a preemie.
so she was in and out of hospitals a lot.
her skin at the end...
I guess it was from the tests and everything.
I was a new parent.
do you know that feeling of, am I doing it right?
am I helping?
you know? You just don't know.
I'm also trained to listen to what people say, and that question, am I helping?
you ask yourself that every day, don't you?
I know you help the people who come to your meetings.
I know you want to help us.
I do?
Yes, you do. Because there's a man who comes to your meetings who puts you on edge, and your instincts of self-preservation are telling you not to trust him, and those instincts are always right. Who is he?
his name is Leo.
I don't have his number or anything, but I did see him talking to one of my friends last night--Jane.
I knocked on her door this morning.
she didn't answer, but there was someone inside because I heard them whispering.
I need Jane's information immediately.
Jane Posner, this is the FBI. Open up!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
open the door, Jane.
no. No. He was right.
we're not looking for you. We're looking for Leo.
he's not here.
he's gone. Clear.
and you're never gonna find him.
thank you so much.
have you ever heard of a folie a deux, Jane?
it's where two people suffer from the same delusional belief.
we're not delusional.
he gets me. All right.
then tell us where he is so we can understand what the two of you have.
you'll kill him. We're not killers.
we're his best hope for getting better. All we want to do is get him the help he needs.
why should I believe you? You already tried to kill him once.
when was that? don't play dumb. With the vaccinations.
what vaccinations?
I don't have to talk to you. So...
no, all you got to do is listen.
cause the closer we get to the truth, the more you're going to be compelled to itch.
the first victim who met Leo was going to write a story about vaccinations.
is that how this all started, because Leo got vaccinations?
hmm. That's a yes.
find out who gave him the vaccinations, we find Leo.
was it his doctor?
Nope, wasn't his doctor. Must have been work, then.
was it the military? Did Leo serve?
it's not military.
did he work in medicine?
is it the hospital? Is that where he worked?
or was it something more like infectious diseases?
cause you'd have to get vaccinated for that.
like the Centers for Disease Control, right here in Atlanta.
leave him alone. Let's go.
what did you tell them?
I didn't say anything. - Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
no, I didn't. I didn't say anything.
let's go. Let's go.
Leo Jenkins. Haven't thought of him in a while.
our search told us he worked here 6 months ago, but his address isn't current.
Yeah, he asked me to send his last check to a different address.
he was pretty paranoid by the end.
because of the vaccinations? Which he didn't even need.
I mean, he was a low-level lab assistant, for god's sake. We were trying to help him.
why would you give him shots he didn't need?
Leo had a painful case of shingles in his left arm.
one of the docs around here gave him the antiviral acyclovir, which, uh, deadened the nerves in his arm...
altogether. Here's his address.
how did that lead to cockroaches?
your brain and nervous system work on a best-guess feedback loop.
the nerves might be dead, but your brain hasn't figured that out yet.
it's still sending stimuli to the dead nerves in an attempt to get them to react.
like an amputee who has feeling in his phantom limb.
exactly. Leo started scratching and he couldn't stop.
well, we told him the feelings will come back when the drugs wore off, but, uh, he insisted that we'd put cockroach larvae in his vaccine.
that it was a conspiracy, that we were all trying to kill him.
we tried almost everything to talk him out of it. Well, almost everything.
what didn't you try?
Leo, the FBI is looking for you.
Yeah, I know they are.
what I don't know is who you are.
I had to rethink everything I know about you.
at the meetings, when you shared about pulling the fibers from your body and you said they felt like spider legs...
you talked about how that made you feel crazy 'cause you're afraid of spider legs?
but is that true?
are you afraid of spiders, Lisa? Yes.
you are? Yes.
No...You don't have to do this.
no, I do have to. I do have to, because, see, I don't know what the truth is anymore.
no.
see, you and I are gonna have a little chat.
I'll just tell you anything that you want to know.
just tell me what you want to know.
it's simple. Who do you work for?
I don't--I don't work for anybody.
who do you work for? Who do you work for?
I don't work for anybody!
I just don't work for anybody.
you don't work for anybody? You're unemployed?
I don't know what you want me to say.
who do you work for? Ok?
we'll keep going. We'll keep going until you give me...
who do you work for? Ohh!
I don't work for anybody! No!
I don't work for anybody! Who do you work for?!
FBI! don't move!
Oh, God.
of course.
she works for you, doesn't she?
we're not here for her. We're here to talk to you.
how about you let her go and we'll do that.
you want to talk? Then how come these things in my arms are going crazy, huh?
I know how this goes, ok? I know how this goes.
you shoot me and then you cover up the whole thing. That's how it goes.
is it happening now? Of course it's happening now.
don't tell me you don't see it. Come on, you see it.
you see it!
I can make it go away.
now, is that your phone?
Yeah, that's my phone.
Don't--what are you doing?
now, look at the camera.
what? I've shot video footage of myself a million times.
you guys do something to it and the image is gone.
it's gone. You guys do something to it.
I'm not shooting video. This is a reflection.
now look at it. Go ahead, look.
look at your arm.
is it going away?
that's a trick. It's no trick.
how did you do that?
we can make them go away forever.
but you have to let her go, Leo.
what? Leo?
how the hell do you know my name?! Don't move, don't even flinch.
get 'em off, get 'em off, get 'em off, get 'em off!
see 'em, see 'em, see 'em, see 'em? Right there.
right there.
I got 'em. I got 'em. Ok.
I got 'em. I got 'em.
so that's it? You ruin my life, now I'm free to go?
you're not an accessory. You didn't know what Leo was doing.
so, yeah, you're free to go.
you killed him, didn't you? I told you, we're not killers.
I don't believe you. You used me.
you tricked me, so you could get him.
Jane, hey.
Jane. Hey, hey, would you just listen to me for a second, ok?
get away from me.
OK, yeah, I had a job to do and I'm not going to apologize for that.
but that doesn't mean that this is over. Leo, he still needs you.
how? He has a good chance of pleading insanity, and he is going to need someone on his side to explain his condition to the court.
Oh, yeah. 'Cause if he's insane, you could put him away forever.
of course you didn't kill him, 'cause that would make a martyr out of him.
but if he's crazy, no one will ever know what I know.
nobody. Which is that he's right!
OK? About the government and the drinking water and you.
all of it! He was going to kill Lisa.
he--he wouldn't do that. I was there.
he had a gun to her head.
Mm. Lies.
lies, lies, and more lies.
and you FBI jackbooted thugs will do anything to protect yourselves from him exposing you as the filthy liars that you are.
Rossi, that was a pretty gutsy move. How'd you know it was gonna work?
the doc at the CDC told us about something they wanted to try but never got around to.
it's called a mirror box. Oh, I read about that treatment.
what's this treatment? It's for amputees with searing pain in their phantom limbs.
basically, you take a patient, you put them in front of a mirror and you tell them to conduct a symphony, to wave, or just to relax.
when their brain sees what's not there, the pain goes away.
and since the unsub had dead nerves in his arm due to the shingles antiviral...
you could argue that his itch was the same thing as phantom limb pain,
I mean from a brain- nervous system feedback loop.
my hope was that the trick would make the itch go away, and it did, for a few seconds, anyway.
I can understand being driven crazy by something you can't scratch, but killing people over it, that's what surprises me.
there is one documented case about a woman who couldn't stop scratching, even when she was asleep.
she woke up one morning realizing she'd scratched through her own scalp, her skull, and directly into her brain tissue.
OK, on that note, my ride's here.
how did it go with Jane? She blames us for everything.
now she's gonna go back to the group and we'll be their new excuse for why they can't get better.
how do we help somebody like that?
well, one of them's feeling better already.
getting rid of a delusion makes us wiser than getting hold of the truth.
and Berlin's pseudo-intellectual, pop culture idiots would watch that shit.
deep down inside, I was very unhappy.
then at this retrospective, they showed "Life Is All You Get" for the millionth time.
I was sitting in the theater and suddenly all I could do was cry.
I realized I was letting life pass me by.
and then I said to myself, Jurgen, "To hell with that cool dude and his tooth gap. You can be more than that! "
Jurgen, you spent the last 8 months in California.
a wonderful country, great people. The glass is always half full.
I took a few classes with a motivation trainer there.
he showed me you can make your dreams come true!
your appearance has changed a bit, too.
Yes. Even if it's hard to believe, I used to have an inferiority complex about my teeth and my looks. I covered it up by telling jokes.
they say you went under the knife of a famous plastic surgeon, any comment?
I had my teeth and my cheek bones done.
hair implants and some silicone work.
silicone?
where?
butt implants! All the stars do it. Check it out.
here, check it out! Here!
they all have them. J-Lo, everybody.
Jurgen, is this all because you'll be turning 40 soon?
I don't have a problem with getting older. I never looked better.
I understand now what life's about. - And that is?
it may sound superficial, but it's true.
for years I preached to my kids about inner values, but it's rubbish!
appearances count. Values catch up. - Last question.
Jurgen, last question.
you had surgery. It's amazing. You look great!
what would you say if your kids suddenly wanted plastic surgery, too?
I mean, you're a role model.
they might try to emulate you.
if it makes them feel better, why not?
it's walls in our heads. That's what I'm talking about.
free yourself from them and you can do anything.
don't let life pass you by. Take control yourself.
you're your own captain on your own big ship of life.
Yeah.
alright, guys. I gotta go!
he used to be so cool.
now he's pumped up with silicone. America really can corrupt you.
but everyone here has silicone boobs, too.
it's fine for boobs, but not Jurgen's ass!
there's good and bad plastic surgery? - Sure!
look out!
look out!
children, ear flaps on!
it's a crosswalk, you giant asshole!
I'd be a blind bat with those on my nose too!
four-eyes!
where were we?
Oh yeah.
boob reductions are pointless operations.
boob augmentations, liposuction, getting rid of cellulite, absolutely necessary.
what about penis extensions?
you have the ability to ruin every serious discussion we have.
pull over. The minister's lover. Right by a baby shop!
shopping with our taxes, Mandy? - I'm just taking a walk.
so that's not actually a pram there? Just an oversized purse on wheels?
it's not mine. I saw it sitting there.
when the baby's here, what then?
will you tell us it's your new, diaper-wearing, bald boyfriend?
Ludo, I've told you before, I'm not pregnant!
Oh, so I must be mistaken then.
maybe you've just gotten fat!
fat? - Sure, I'll just write 'fat.'
Ludo, you know what? You're a real bastard!
minister's LOVER PREGNANT
there you are.
you brought our sweet little Lollo.
he behaves so well in restaurants!
I told you, Lollo.
your uncle was looking forward to seeing you.
since he forgot your birthday. - Oh, shit!
shit! Shit!
shit! Shit!
sweet kid.
weren't you in India at the orphanage?
I was, and I brought back sweet little Shiva here.
is she your latest?
if his mouth is open, he's lying.
and he's useless in bed, too.
wasn't my impression. - All faked.
I'm sorry you slept with my brother.
but I want to order. - Let's get it over with.
Ludo?
how would you like a nice big dish of meat?
lots of different kinds?
just one gets so boring.
just water.
but not a hysterical, reproachful water that's never heard of one-night stands.
a calm, non-stressful one.
I'll have the meat platter.
sounded good.
still no news. If he hasn't called by tonight, I'll forget it.
what about that graphic artist you always call?
no way, It's over, For good, He's such a pervert!
what? Why? - Doesn't matter.
no, tell me. - No, it's yucky.
fine, then don't. - Alright, if you insist.
he said he wanted me to pee the next time we meet.
what? In front of him?
I couldn't do that. - Anna, on him!
you've got a knack for finding weirdoes.
I know.
but I have stories to tell, unlike you.
but I wouldn't constantly order anchovy pizza,
I know it tastes bad.
pizzas don't give you orgasms. - Guys do?
true. - When you eat it, the pizza's gone.
pizza won't say" it's too young for responsibility at 38."
you don't have to say," it was good." - It doesn't look at you saying, "Come! Come! Come!"
quiet up there!
enjoy.
jeez, Ludo.
you can't go on like this forever.
Why?
my job is fun. I've got great friends.
I date pretty women.
and what about love, affection and security?
the warmth of a family?
seeing your sleeping child and feeling your heart burst with joy.
you're missing the best things in life.
Lollo, come here now!
moritz? Okay, I'm coming. Gotta run.
klitschko is proposing to Yvonne Catterfeld.
that soccer player? - Precisely.
it never happened before and never will.
it's all cordoned off. We can forget it.
go cry with the other girls. I'm getting my shot!
you're so cruel.
being realistic doesn't make me a pansy.
Andreas.
you okay? - Ludo!
we need seats in the restaurant. - Not today.
what are you smiling at? Lucky I don't smack you one.
What're we going to do?
has your boss seen the photos of your party in the President Suite?
what party?
remember? The cute mustached guys.
in police uniforms. Were they real?
how about free passes to our wellness area?
the sundeck has a fantastic view of the city lights.
do we look like frustrated wives?
and of the gorgeous, see-through glass dome over our restaurant.
what will it be? A massage?
a Cleopatra bath? A facial?
we have 10 minutes. What's quick?
wellness means relaxation and not... - Fine. I'll take the massage.
excellent. Danielle?
Yes.
hello. - Hello.
may I take you to my room? You may undress there.
glad to.
would you give me the Cleopatra bath?
of course I will.
me and a few slutty maids looking for an extra buck.
it's our special service for perverts who think this is a cheap brothel.
okay, sorry. It doesn't hurt to ask.
so what's the quickest? - Thorsten!
one full body depilation!
Depilation? Doesn't that hurt?
it depends. - On what?
if you have hair or not.
what's that weird squeaking?
it's the sound of dolphins in the ocean.
it's very relaxing.
sure having fun, those dolphins.
dolphins are very social.
almost human. - Ludo, I'm coming!
I think one of them is called Ludo.
Ludo! Ludo!
dear friends, my dear Yvonne...
an old Russian proverb says:
even if women were made of glass, you couldn't see through them.
that way. Go.
and my personal opinion on that: Proverbs are often complete nonsense!
come on! - What is this shit?
when I first saw you at the Golden Camera, standing there...
Ouch! - Come on!
looking at me with those blue eyes. - I remember, my buttercup...
it's the perfect shot!
this wax is stuck to the railing. - Then rip it off.
the hell I will. Do you know how much that'll hurt?
at that moment I knew...
...that I had fallen in love with you, with your beauty.
come and take the damn picture!
your soul.
your heart.
Ludo, it's glass! It'll break!
your gracefulness. - "It'll break!"
panda bear, that's lovely, but "brevity is the soul of wit."
watch!
get to the point.
is that cracking?
we're hungry.
Yvonne, I love you. - It's bullet-proof.
and I want to ask you here and now...
did you invite him? - No, but since he dropped in...
little man...
I don't remember inviting you.
resume the Ludo Decker hearing.
let's move to the sentencing.
why is she giving me that evil look?
actually, she's looking at me. She's cross-eyed.
how do you know that?
she's my ex-wife.
your ex-wife? Shit! Then she's biased.
No! We separated on good terms.
Really? Look at her expression. - I know.
she looked like that at our wedding. Believe me, it doesn't mean a thing.
have the gentlemen finished? Then I may proceed.
the court regards the defendant's claim to have gotten lost on the hotel roof a feeble attempt at self-protection.
the court holds the defendant's behavior to be highly immature.
the court moves to forego the fine requested by the prosecutor.
bingo, I said so!
the defendant should be allowed to work on his poor social skills.
I sentence him to 8 months of jail.
I'm going to jail! - Wait!
Erika! Come on!
sit your ass down!
the sentence will be suspended.
terms will be 300 hours' community service.
in a city day-care center. - She can't!
she can!
if the defendant violates probation, the prison sentence will be enforced.
daily CHECKMATED Hot off the press this morning, for gentlemen with kind regards.
he screwed you two! When I say screwed, I mean it.
and that Jurgen Vogel screwed you two idiots good and proper.
he's laughing at us!
including me!
do you know what I can't stand? Do you know?
when someone makes fun of us. - You deserve a diploma!
things like that happen.
remember Hitler's diary?
so? And did we print it?
no. - Now here's something funny.
your naked ass on Klitschko's wedding ring. Hilarious, ain't it?
let's get it on YouTube, eBay!
and to change the subject, how did it go in court?
they hit me with 300 hours' community service.
300 hours for that nonsense? Was she mad?
what?
you'll have to cut back a little on your free-time.
cut back. Cut back on fuck-bunnies. Good one!
and now get out! Okay? But instead of Stefan and Lukas, you two get me pictures of those folk music morons! Got it? Go!
Michi Nussbaumer and Daniela Berg.
you have decided to tie the knot after 9 long years.
Michi, why did you wait so long?
well, I asked my sweet pea before, but she didn't want me.
when we were on Karl Moik's show,
Michi came to me and said "We'd make a super team" .
whaddya say?
why did you say no, Dani?
we were only 12.
it was our first TV performance.
Michi, there have been strange rumors of you wanting to separate.
and others about an affair. Any comment?
they're nonsense.
wouldn't you like to try the meat?
the world isn't always rosy in our business.
and yet our job is the best in the world!
we don't just sing 'Baby, yeah, yeah' all the time.
our music comes from the heart.
Andi had a problem with Dani and me. - What are you talking about?
tell 'em! - What?
well?
shall we take the photo in front of the wedding cabinet?
fine. - May we go to the toilet?
we need to go to the toilet. - I'm eating.
I'll keep an eye on that.
up the staircase and straight ahead.
you want me to hide in the cabinet?
just until something happens. Then snap and go.
shall I just stroll out, "Hi! Could I have another sausage?"
think of something. - Then you sit here!
are you nuts? I have to get to that day-care.
and what if they don't fight? Things looked very sweet just now.
I think the sausage has gone to your head. I'm relying on you. Okay?
I can say what I want, stupid cow! - So the tabloids can write - you're screwing that slut , Manuela can't even spell" slut."
because she's so stupid!
I hate this stupid Bavarian crap!
this saccharin bullshit!
then go back to your home town and your job at the meat counter.
pulling Andi into this was low! - He told everyone.
Andi Borg knows. Karl Moik knows. Florian Silbereisen knows.
if he knows, then Carmen does.
who's fault is it? Whose hormones are out of control?
at least I have some. - I hate you!
Hey!
Hey! Are you crazy?
grandpa's favorite bell. It's broken!
Michi, I didn't mean it like that.
Hello, I'm... - Ludo Decker. I don't believe it.
have we met? - Yes. I'm Anna Gotzlowski.
doesn't ring a bell. - No?
think hard.
isn't it sometimes nicer not to call and keep the memory of it?
what are you on about? - I was probably drunk.
are they from our garden?
did you rip them out? - No.
they're for you.
so what do you want? - I'm here for my community service.
that's you?
come in.
nice glasses. - Bootlicker.
could I use the toilet?
right here. - Thanks.
and aim for Snow White!
what are you doing here? - I have to pee.
with a phone?
no. 1 or No. 2?
who's asking? - I am.
that way.
and aim for Snow White!
come on, think hard. Anna Gotzlowski. Gotzlowski. With a 'G '
and she's butt-ugly? - Nerdy glasses and a cat jersey.
you'd never talk to someone like her. - I just don't know.
what about that children's benefit gala?
you left with the 'Leute' presenter. - The film prize?
the twin hostesses. - And the Aids gala?
the Asian weightlifter. I wanted her.
no private calls! Time for work! Got it? Hang up! Thanks.
remember the meeting with the boss. - No can do. I can't leave.
the hell I will! His blood pressure is already 580!
don't cry. I'll be there ASAP.
I have to brown nose for a while.
a brown horse? - Nose!
what do you mean 'hose'
good grief!
do you remember now?
I can give you a hint:
playing field.
soccer.
Hey, four-eyes!
here it comes.
very funny, Ludo.
laugh it up!
you were Susi's or Bine's friend? - Nope.
but we had a load of fun together.
or you had your fun with me.
you played that funny game with me.
3, 2, 1. - What was it called?
fire! - Magnet bingo?
Yeah! Magnet bingo! Now I remember.
small world! You're little Anna. You always tattled on me to my sister.
stupid idiot! I'm telling your sister!
and I thought we had had sex. - I was eight!
we're only good, old friends. Super!
we're not friends. - Come on. I used to give you Cokes.
your parents wouldn't let you drink that American crap.
Hey, four-eyes! Nice glasses.
Thanks.
want a tasty Coke? - Coke is very yummy.
catch!
Thanks.
you asshole! - That was funny!
you'll have your fun soon enough. Promise.
then he'll have to wait!
ask him about his stupid vacation home on Sylt. That'll calm him down again.
turn it off. - I'm working.
right. We need a new jungle gym. - I'm a journalist, not a handyman.
I'll put it together, you can help Cheyenne-Blue in the john.
she has trouble with Snow White. - I'll build it. Where is it?
you're sitting on it.
here are the instructions. It should be easy.
just follow the arrows.
unfortunately it's all in Dutch.
are you sure it's not for a jet engine?
listen up, jerk. If you refuse, one call to your probation officer and you land in jail.
thank you.
same to you, stupid cow.
you say pretty funny things.
Really? Then you're the only girl here who thinks so.
maybe we should've given him the German instructions.
you can't be serious! I told you everything he did to me.
but he is kinda sexy. Don't you think?
what's sexy about him? - His butt, for example. Pretty hot.
you're drooling. He's only a stupid underwear model.
Hello?
no way! I don't believe it!
Lena-Chantal, that's why you have to pick your things!
you clean up your crap!
you clean up after yourself!
no phone calls here!
give it to me now! - You're kidding.
give me your telephone! - No way!
okay, friend... - I thought we weren't friends.
don't you have a job?
something to do with a jungle gym? - I'm done.
no way. Where? - Where you wanted it.
I want to see it.
what the hell is this? - A pretty wild jungle gym set.
no, it's not. It's a disease. - I didn't have much time.
hold on, any half-witted chimp could put it together in 30 minutes.
if he knew Dutch, sure.
amazing how guys like you always have an excuse for your own incompetence.
women know everything but can't put together IKEA shelves.
I've put together thousands! - At the IKEA world championships?
stupid ass ass!
pecker!
now you've wrecked it.
you really try your hardest. I said no phone calls!
it's a text message. I'm allowed to read a message!
no text messaging either!
that didn't hurt.
nice of you to visit.
we actually wanted to ask you about day-care.
no way! He's a trouble maker!
only when I'm provoked. - Don't say that about him!
it's not his fault.
it's a bad idea. If something goes wrong, the ogre sends me to jail.
what could happen? - He's been thrown out of 10 day-cares!
8. - 12.
and he bit off his au-pair's ear. - She provoked me.
the doctor said in a few years her natural skin color will come back.
it'd be my death. So, nice seeing you.
What'd be your death?
Hello, Anna!
remember me? Lilli, Ludo's sister.
you always tattled to me.
I didn't tattle. - Yes, you did.
what's the problem here?
Ludo won't let Lollo join the day-care group.
Ludo has no say here.
welcome to our day-care center. - Really?
Thanks. I promise he won't cause trouble.
and if he does?
then it's your fault. Easy.
"was the happiness of the Bavarian beauty and the tawdry trumpeter just a big lie?"" Were things over years ago when Michi started flirting with the meat counter girl Manuela S?"
I'd love to know who cares.
I'd say about 12 million readers.
stop gabbing, Set up the chairs.
what's happening? - Did I say ask questions?
Bello Bear's Magic Show. - Bello, who?
you don't know?
an ex music teacher who writes great children's songs.
a grown-up who calls himself Bello Bear?
of course he thinks it's uncool. - The kids think he's cool.
kids think sticking a pea in your nose is cool.
at least some guys don't only think about their abs.
when you're done with the chairs, then you can set up Bello's stage.
I thought the jerk could do magic.
good morning. Let's be a bird. - Eagle!
a big bird with long wings.
an eagle. A golden eagle.
now let's be coral in the sea, swaying back and forth in the sea. - Alright!
next time aim for Snow White! That's why Anna painted it there.
what's so difficult about pooping straight down!
and you get these back when you act nice again.
you said they were a present.
do you want your uncle to get upset?
good morning, sun!
good morning, grass!
good morning, trees!
Hey, Madonna! Someone wants to join in here.
always making fun of everything. - They'll get in the Waldorf school.
good morning, globalization opponents! Good morning, world peace!
good morning, armpit hair!
good morning, Ludo!
good morning, Ludo!
that'll get 'em in the Rutli school. - Bello's assistant is sick.
who cares?
there are lots of kids here! Shall we all call for Mucky?
Yes!
mucky!
there's Mucky!
so, who are you?
what kind of a funny boy are you?
I'm Mucky from the Magic Forest. - I know, tell the kids!
I'm Mucky from the Magic Forest!
Yes, Mucky from the Me-My-Magic Forest.
can you say it louder and funnier?
I'm Mucky from the Magic Forest!
get on with it, jerk! - It's my show, buddy!
let's sing a magic bear song and everyone can dance along.
I'm Bi-Ba-Bello. I come from afar and all the key-kay-kids call me the magic bear.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. I'm the magic bear.
alright, my dear Mucky!
now it's time for some magic!
Abracadabra!
no good?
you are really spoiled.
then silly-billy Mucky will have to help me.
get your paws off me, jerk!
idiot! - Get lost, asshole!
do you know how to tie shoes?
of course. Come here.
have a seat.
fine.
these don't have laces.
but they sure are pretty shoes. New?
no, I've had them for 5 years. - 5 years! You were born with them?
you're funny.
say, what's your name?
Cheyenne-Blue.
Cheyenne-Blue? That's a unique name.
my mom's an actress.
actresses aren't allowed to give their kids normal names.
I see. And is your dad an actor?
no, he's an asshole!
and your mom's through with men?
my mom says she can never get enough men.
she's got lots of new ones now. Hundreds, even thousands.
and where from? - From the theater.
where she works. She chooses one and brings him home.
your mom sounds real nice.
but they don't get breakfast. Only I do.
that sounds good.
hello.
mommy!
Hey, there.
Hi, I'm Nina, Cheyenne-Blue's mom. - Hi, I'm Ludo.
I've heard a lot about you.
my daughter has a crush on you.
I can understand why.
how nice that mom and daughter agree.
and someone as cute as you can be crazy about kids?
I believe that society is only worth as much as the love and affection it shows to its smallest members.
you know, I don't usually do something like this, but I'd love to have you over when the little one's asleep.
glad to.
Where'd you dig up this little treasure?
easy. From his probation officer. Otherwise he'd have landed in jail.
Really? In jail?
what? - Bye.
Ouch! Are you crazy?
what was that? - This is not a pick-up joint!
I am working hard here! - We're a day-care, not a brothel!
lighten up, baby!
say that again and I'll tell on you. - Go ahead. Just like the old days.
I've had it. I'm calling your probation officer.
let's see how funny jail is.
go ahead. Say hi for me, too.
I am relaxed! If I want to, I can really let myself go!
I'm an animal in bed!
and another thing: You gave the kids darts. Great!
have you lost your mind? Do you know what could happen?
jeez, they're kids not complete idiots!
Anna.
if the police don't revoke your license, I will.
you can't lose what you don't have. - What?
watch out, four-eyes! - Four-eyes?
I don't even need them to watch TV.
great! It was new.
don't you have any other problems?
stop! Stop!
to the hospital. Fast!
shit! I'm out of cash.
what's he doing? Keep driving!
money doesn't grow on trees. - Hey, we've got an injured child.
do I look like a charity?
it's an emergency, you bastard! - Hey, calm down.
here's a 20.
now get driving, jerk! - Stay calm.
uncle Ludo.
I can't see anything.
it hurts so much.
nonsense. It's just a little mosquito bite.
just a mosquito bite.
what are you doing? Keep driving! - End of the road.
if you have another bill, I'll keep going.
asshole!
you always meet again. Wait and see. - Ludo, let's go.
fag!
we need a doctor!
and I need the health card and your son's name.
can't you see the dart in his head?
his name! - Who the hell cares!
not in that tone.
can you pay the processing fee?
get your fat ass moving and find a doctor!
or I'll sue you all after I smack you in the mouth!
the dart is lodged in the skull, but hasn't penetrated the bone.
the skull lining is intact.
now I'll pull out the dart.
it'll hurt a little, but Indians are brave.
it'll just sting a little.
just don't look at it.
look at me.
Lollo! Look me in the eye. Tell me, what's that bunny you like called?
Felix. - Felix, right.
and what does he have on his back? - A backpack.
exactly.
that was it.
we'll clean it up a bit, and then give you a tetanus shot.
what?
mom!
I didn't even cry. - Great!
a real champion.
that's real important when you have a rusty dart in your head.
why not leave them in the sandbox next time? Raises your chances.
if you keep your eye on the kids as you did today, you'll really help!
then lock me in the bathroom.
with your head down the toilet! - Asshole!
nice to meet you. - Stop it!
it's okay. We're here almost weekly.
we both messed up. - No, you did!
you mess everything up. You left them in the garden.
and so it's all your fault that your nephew nearly bled to death!
what are you gaping at? No forms to fill out?
get undressed. - Everything?
didn't you want to blow in the orchestra?
okay. - Alright then.
get undressed. - What instrument should I blow?
you'll see soon enough.
it will be a very big one.
pervert! - It's me.
Hi. I just wanted to say I didn't call your probation officer.
Yeah. - Because I want to stop tattling.
and because I might have been a little tough on you.
is this an apology? - In a manner of speaking.
a manner of speaking?
dear Ludo... - So it's not an apology?
I may have emotionally overreacted now and then.
I wasn't always fair... - Are you reading this?
nonsense.
you did great with Lollo today.
this shone a light on certain qualities you possess.
we should've paid better attention. - Hey, you are reading it!
furthermore I'm sorry for giving you the complicated Dutch instructions.
I shall submit the German ones to you immediately.
did you type it or write it by hand? - Don't keep interrupting.
does this make everything alright again?
is everything alright, you jerk?
whose baton is the biggest? - Yours!
who's shouting?
I'm watching a Jackie Chan film. - Oh.
there, it's over. - So what're you...
What're you doing tomorrow? - Nothing, why?
maybe we could have fish and chips. - Fish and chips?
I love fish.
you love fish?
Hello?
I opened his present. A trip to a 5-star wellness hotel on Mallorca.
I figure I'm with the best guy in the world.
he drives me to the airport. Kisses me. Separation anxiety.
how will I manage without you?
I jokingly say, "It was your idea, honey.
I'm at the airport. My flight gets cancelled.
I take a taxi home. Open the door and walk in.
he's screwing my best friend. On my blankie.
I couldn't believe it. - That's tough.
it gets worse. They had one of his pornos on!
I never understood how anyone can watch that stuff.
I put up with it because I loved him. But he fucks her on my blankie.
and then? - Then I threw him out.
we talked it over, nearly made up, I forgave him...
and then he went to her and the baby.
I did everything for him. I made a fool of myself.
and he was just a jerk.
no relationship can work if you're being made a fool of.
either the one on top dumps the fool, because he's bored and lost respect.
or the fool realizes that he's a fool, that he's selling himself short and has nothing left, and he goes.
look at it like this, you learnt something:
men are jerks and make you unhappy.
no man in the world can make you happy, if you weren't happy already.
you have to make yourself happy.
it's totally selfish to wait at home, frustrated, expecting someone else to make you happy all the time.
and anyway it's normal to be unhappy.
I don't run around every day saying, "Life is awesome"!
why does everyone expect to be happy all the time?
sounds nice, but what do you know about relationships?
you only want sex.
think I've never had a relationship? That's why I'm alone!
it's so difficult to find someone who's got it together and doesn't expect me to make them happy.
and blame me for it when they're not.
so when's your book coming out? - What book?
Ludo Decker, Pour Some Sunshine in Your Life,
together Alone.
is it in the library?
it's on eBay.
you can't accept responsibility. You only want sex.
why not? It's fun.
what about the girls you sleep with? Are they having fun, too?
I really think so.
they should be grateful they can sit at home and be love-sick?
you think they're in love with me? - Happens to women sometimes.
not mine. My women know what they're getting into.
the boundaries are discussed from the start.
Ludo, you can discuss all you want, but things change.
maybe I sleep with a guy and nothing happens. A one-night stand. Great!
if it was good, I keep going back...
at some point I think, maybe he's got more to him.
by the fifth time women are in love.
Really?
no matter what you've discussed, it's still no free ticket to act like an ass and shirk any responsibility.
responsibility? I only have it if I'm together with someone.
if I say from the start, " Let's have fun, but I don't want a relationship.
then I'm not an ass. If you don't get it, tough.
then no more sex for you. - Why not?
you don't get it! They're just acting. That's the joke.
listen. You say: I just want some fun.
she says: Let's just have some fun, but thinks: Those were duds before me.
he doesn't know I'm the best thing he's ever had. Wait till he finds out!
you stick to the original agreement, she's been going down another street and in the end you're the ass.
so either I have sex and I am an ass, or I'm not an ass and I don't have sex, right?
Yes.
then I'd rather be an ass.
I thought so.
let's be serious. That woman has no clue.
that's why she's working at a day-care center.
my dad's a renter. - Center.
no, a renter!
I'm proof she doesn't know what she's talking about.
I'm a woman.
right?
I'm telling you, some women only want sex.
maybe they're pretending. - The hell they are!
Ludo, relax. - Don't ruin things.
you're too tense.
I'm a woman and I only want sex.
dirty, quick, hard.
and the best thing is: No ties.
and on top of it:
I turn into a pizza afterward.
holy cow.
what's up?
so when a position opened in the Art History department...
...she pursued it single-mindedly until she was hired.
it was whispered that Katherine Watson...
...a first-year teacher from Oakland State...
...made up in brains what she lacked in pedigree.
which was why this bohemian from California...
... was on her way to the most conservative college in the nation.
excuse me, please. -Oh ， sorry.
excuse me.
excuse me. The bus?
keep walking, ma'am. -Thank you.
but Katherine Watson didn't come to Wellesley to fit in.
she came to Wellesley because she wanted to make a difference.
violet. -My favorite ltalian professor.
nice summer? -Terrific， thanks.
who's that over there? -Where?
Oh， Katherine Watson. New teacher in Art History. I'm dying to meet her.
who knocks at the Door of Learning?
I am every woman. -What do you seek?
to awaken my spirit through hard work...and dedicate my life to knowledge.
then you are welcome.
all women who seek to follow you can enter here.
I now declare the academic year begun.
a shame you didn't come yesterday. It's so quiet before the girls arrive.
just a few rules. No holes in the walls.
no pets, no loud noises, no radio or hi-fi after 8 on weekdays...
...10 on weekends...
...no hot plates and no male visitors.
anything wrong?
I don't think I can go a year without a hot plate.
don't you just love chintz?
and look.
they match.
Sweet,right? Your room's here.
my room is just across the way...
...and Amanda Armstrong's down the other end.
you grew up here? -My whole life.
you'll meet my parents when they come to visit.
they visit? -Regularly.
what do you teach? -Speech， elocution and poise.
dinners are communal, so I'll handle that.
but breakfast and lunch, you're on your own. So...
...we each get our own shelf. I'll make your label this evening.
I don't need to tell you, everything on our individual shelves is sacrosanct.
I just knew when we met.....we'd be instant friends.
be careful. They can smell fear.
good morning. -Good morning.
thank you.
this is History of Art.
we'll be following Dr. Staunton's syllabus.
any questions so far? -Your name?
why don't you go first? -Connie Baker.
Katherine Watson. Nice to meet you. -Dr. Watson, I presume.
not yet. And you are? -Giselle Levy.
Susan Delacorte. -Thank you, Susan Delacorte.
from the beginning, man has always had the impulse to create art.
can anyone tell me what this is? -Wounded Bison, Altamira, Spain...
...about 15,000 B. C. Joan Brandwyn.
very good, Joan.
despite the age of these, they are technically sophisticated because
the shading and the thickness of the lines moving over the bison's hump.
ls that right? -Yes, that's exactly right.
next slide.
this is probably less familiar. It was discovered by archeologists
in 1879, Lascaux, France. Dates back to 10,000 B.C.
singled out because of flowing lines depicting the movement of the animal.
lmpressive. Name? -Herd of Horses.
I meant yours. -We call her Flicka.
Elizabeth Warren. They call me Betty.
very good.
Betty is also correct.
just because something is ancient doesn't mean that it is primitive.
for example. Next slide, please.
Mycerinus and His Queen. 2470 B.C.
it's a funerary statue of the pharaoh and queen...
...originally intended to preserve the pharaoh's ka. Soul.
have any of you taken Art History before?
no.
let's go on. Slide.
seated Scribe. Egypt. 2400 B. C.
peasant Couple Plowing. Sixteenth century B. C. Egypt.
snake Goddess. Minoan. 1 600 B. C.
fresco. Minoan. 1 600 B. C.
funeral Mask. Mycenaean. 1 200.
could someone please get--?
thank you.
by a show of hands only...how many of you have read the entire text?
and the suggested supplements. -Long way from Oakland State?
well, you girls do prepare.
if you've nothing else for us, we could go to independent study.
I was in California once. How do you get work done with all that sunshine?
we tan in class. -Really?
no.
you know, not everybody wanted you.
I'm not naming any names.
these jobs usually go quickly. Ex-students, friends of, you know...
...the right people.
the person they wanted took a job at Brown, and no one else was available.
so here you are.
you can go in now. Good luck.
your first class left a lot to be desired， Miss Watson.
and I'm curious about the subject of your dissertation.
you suggest, "Picasso will do for the 20th century...
...what Michelangelo did for the Renaissance, unquote.
in terms of influencing movements.
so these canvases that they're turning out these days...
...with paint dripped and splotched on them...
...they're as worthy of our attention as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel?
I'm not comparing them.
have you ever seen the Sistine Chapel, Miss Watson?
actually stood there?
I've never been to Europe.
I can assure all of you this is the place I want to be more than anything.
better discipline next class， Miss Watson.
hello. -It's me.
Hey! -Collect from Katherine Watson.
will you accept? -Yeah， sure， of course I will.
Hey, is everything okay?
Yeah.
tough, huh?
well, how are the classes?
snobs, right?
I hate to say I told you so. -You don't have to.
I can't really talk right now.
I'll write you tonight.
so you got a fella?
he's-- He's there. I'm here.
long distance. Torture. I know. Come. Come in and sit down.
when Lenny left for the South Pacific， it nearly broke my heart.
we wrote every day until...
he was a great man.
I'm sorry. -lt was a hundred years ago.
I'm babbling.
I love Lucy. Even if she is a communist.
the only thing red about Lucy is her hair.
and even that's fake. Desi said it.
Winchell wrote it.
Amanda Armstrong. I see you survived.
Katherine Watson. Just barely.
Oh, good. You've met. Katherine's taken the third bedroom.
how about a little dinner before What's My Line?
how about a little drink?
her companion died in May.
companion?
you know, companion.
Josephine Burns. Taught biology here for 30 years.
you'll love it here, Katherine. You'll see.
I already do. I-- Honestly, it's beautiful. It's perfect, really.
well, don't fool yourself. They have claws underneath their white gloves.
who?
the alumnae, their offspring, the faculty. You name it.
watch out for yourself.
too much independence frightens them.
will you please stop? -Oh, a word of advice.
don't let those girls know that they got to you.
they didn't. -Good for you.
you almost convinced me.
what is that? -You tell me.
carcass by Soutine. 1 925.
it's not on the syllabus. -No, it's not.
is it any good?
come on, ladies. There's no wrong answer.
there's also no textbook telling you what to think.
it's not that easy, is it?
all right. No. It's not good.
in fact, I wouldn't even call it art. It's grotesque.
is there a rule against grotesque art?
I think there's something aggressive about it...
...and erotic. -To you, everything is erotic.
everything is erotic. -Girls.
aren't there standards? -Of course.
otherwise a tacky velvet painting could be equated to a Rembrandt.
my Uncle Ferdie has two tacky velvet paintings. He loves those clowns.
there are standards, technique， composition, color, even subject.
so if you're suggesting that rotted side of meat is art...
...much less good art, then what are we going to learn?
just that.
you have outlined our new syllabus， Betty. Thank you.
what is art? What makes it good or bad?
and who decides?
next slide, please.
twenty-five years ago someone thought this was brilliant.
I can see that. -Who?
my mother. I painted it for her birthday.
next slide. This is my mom.
ls it art? -It's a snapshot.
if I told you Ansel Adams had taken it， would that make a difference?
art isn't art until someone says it is. -It's art!
the right people. -Who are they?
Betty Warren!
we're lucky we have one right here. -Screw you.
could you go back to the Soutine， please?
just look at it again. Look beyond the paint.
let us try to open our minds to a new idea.
all right, back to chapter three. Has anyone read it?
okay.
when your courses are set, and a dream boat you've met...
...have a real cigarette. Have a Camel.
I've got my courses, I've got my Camel cigarette. Where is my dream boat?
Giselle, where is my dream boat? -Betty's cousin isn't good enough?
I haven't met him. -Don't encourage her.
he's only escorting Connie as a favor.
why are you like this?
I didn't mean that.
I'm just under so much pressure with the wedding.
do you realize November 2 is three weeks from now?
Oh, honey. -Don't have it.
don't come. -Here. Here.
I'm working on table seating now, so I can just erase your name.
can I see it? -No.
let me look. I can't look for a second?
you want to see where Bill is sitting. -No. That is over. Right?
right? Giselle, right?
damn it.
do I look a little bit like her? -Like who?
Katherine Watson. -You mean, "crap is art"?
I think she's fabulous. -Well, no man wanted her.
she isn't dead. -She's at least 30.
Oh, no. No. -I guess she never wanted children.
for your information...
...Katherine Watson had to take this job to escape from California.
please.
she had a torrid affair with a Hollywood movie star.
she came here to get away. -That's ridiculous.
who was it? -I don't know.
who was it, Giselle? Don't be a pimple! Tell me!
it's ridiculous. -Tell me. No， it's not. You know.
you know something. Tell me. -It's William Holden.
fantastic! -I know.
who is it?
william Holden.
I know. I know. I'm late. I'm-- Abject pleading, apologies, forgiveness.
is she giving you any trouble?
if these girls can't get back on time， know what I say? Lock them out.
come on. Out! I'm going to lock the door. Out!
bedtime, ladies. Bedtime. Let's go. Bedtime.
Hey, Betty. -Quiet time， ladies.
women like Katherine Watson don't get married...
...because they choose not to. -No woman chooses to live...
...without a home, unless she's sleeping with her ltalian professor.
you are so critical. -I am not.
of course you are. You're your mother's daughter.
it's a classic Electra complex.
I don't blame you. I mean...
...who wouldn't want to murder your mother?
Hey. How's the Harvard sweetheart? -Divine.
got an extra ciggie?
did you do his homework? -Of course.
want to do mine? -No.
this isn't what I think it is. Is it?
Where'd you get it?
from the school nurse.
it's against the law. -Oh, honey. It's a girl's best friend.
a certain kind of girl. -Meet the last virgin bride.
Spencer is a gentleman. -And even gentlemen have dicks.
maybe I'll get one. -What? A dick?
don't be stupid, Connie.
Someone， somewhere, someday might be interested.
just in case. Just in case, I'll be prepared.
was that necessary?
I was taught it's best to speak honestly.
okay. You're a bitch.
we recently learned that Amanda Armstrong...
...our nurse, has been distributing contraception to Wellesley girls.
this revelation is disturbing to an institution... that prides itself on propriety.
go, go, go! Go, go! It's been going on since the late '80s.
whoever wins is first to marry! -Do the girls take it literally?
only the girl with the winning hoop. Oh， look, it's Phyllis Nayor!
good for her. It gets me every time.
why the buggies? -They've got their man.
they're wishing for their babies.
have you seen this?
what is it?
it's a front-page attack on Amanda Armstrong. Betty Warren wrote it.
by providing contraception on demand, our school nurse...
...is little more than a cheerleader for promiscuity. Wow.
Oh, they're not going to dump her in a lake!
I'm coming, Phyllis! -Have you seen this?
I wouldn't worry. Betty's just a young girl flexing her muscles.
so was Lizzie Borden， and her mother wasn't president...
...of the alumnae association. -Would somebody get that girl a towel!
that's her mother? -Apple, tree.
is Amanda going to get into trouble?
Amanda needs to start minding her p's and q's.
the trick to surviving Wellesley is never getting noticed.
Ciao, Mona Lisa.
the big war hero.
he thinks he's something special.
he sleeps with his students.
the gold is fine. The napkin rings are vulgar.
the glassware should be trimmed with gold.
the little sugar boxes, gold and white， filled with chocolate. No candlesticks.
freesia instead of daisies. -Wise choice, madam.
no baby's breath.
you already had your fitting? -We're on our way.
here's the seating chart and Spencer's list of groomsmen.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I spoke to him about reading the poem. He'd rather not. I said all right.
excuse us for a second, Joan.
a good wife lets her husband think that everything's his idea...
...even when it's not. -I don't care if he reads it.
you will in retrospect.
now, why don't you see if you can't nudge the idea into his head.
I've been here now for 21 years， Jocelyn.
I remember you as a student. -Twenty-four, if you count that.
so why the theatrics?
we cannot appear to promote sexual promiscuity.
okay. It's about appearances, then? No.
all right, all right.
all right. Well, I promise not to appear to be sympathetic, progressive...
...or what did Mrs. Warren call it? Liberal.
Scout's honor.
I spent the better part of Friday afternoon convincing the alumnae...
...that your record was impeccable...
...that you would no longer provide contraceptive devices...
...and you'd make a public statement to that effect.
I'm not willing to make a public statement.
it doesn't matter, Amanda.
they're letting you go.
it's out of my hands.
and this champagne cup is in the wrong place.
and up and down. And up.
Katherine. Good evening, Miss Watson.
good evening, Miss Watson. -Join us.
no.
good night, Miss Watson. -Good night， Miss Watson.
and down. Very nice. Very nice.
Hey.
heard about Amanda. I'm sorry.
she seemed all right about it. I wouldn't be.
they don't give you too many chances around here.
Oh, that depends how much they hate you to begin with.
can I buy you a drink? Or are you here for dinner?
how long do the marriage lectures take?
get this woman a booth.
your husband is at a crossroads in his career.
he's competing for promotion against two rivals, Smith and Jones.
to get the edge, you have wisely decided to invite the boss.....and his wife to a 7:00 dinner.
you've carefully planned your meal...
...set your table and arranged for a babysitter.
Oh, we have babies! -Yes， and I have twins!
then, surprise. It's 6: 1 5...
...and your husband's called to say that Smith， Jones and their wives...
...have been invited at the boss's request.
ever the Wellesley girl...
...you keep your cool and understand...
...that the boss is probably testing you as much as your husband. What next?
yes? -File for divorce?
that's very funny.
but the thing is, it's not a joke.
a few years from now your sole responsibility...
...will be taking care of your husband and children.
you may all be here.....for an easy A...
...but the grade that matters the most is the one he gives you， not me.
you'll need to-- -Whatever you do...
...don't put the boss's wife next to your husband.
why not? -She's screwing him.
is that where you learned to speak ltalian? In ltaly?
Yeah.
have you got a boyfriend? -Yes.
you know, if you were mine, I'd never let you go.
I wouldn't have asked your permission.
Yeah, they say you're progressive.
a forward thinker.
are you? -There are a lot of labels here...
...I've noticed.
right family, right school, right art， right way of thinking.
well, saves the effort on thinking for yourself.
how do you expect to ever make a difference if everything is a joke?
Oh, Katherine Watson comes to Wellesley to set us all free? Come on.
thank you for the drink. -No, no. Wait. I was teasing.
they have their own way of doing things here.
you've just gotta find a way to work with them. We all had to.
I'm sorry.
five years ago, they'd have slapped my wrist.
but now there's a committee for the protection of everything.
they think you're dangerous?
Oh, no, darling. No. Subversive.
it's gotten to the point...
...where you don't know who is protecting whom from what.
or should that be "from whom"? Well， whom gives a damn anyway?
they're doing me a favor really.
will you be all right?
better than that.
I should really have left when Josephine died.
nothing left to love here anymore. So...
Hello?
miss Watson? -Yes. I'm back here.
I've never been to this part of campus before. Where are we?
no man's land. So to speak.
come on in.
what's all this?
different things different days.
people who inspire me, artists I admire, editorials I don't.
so you came to see me.
you gave me a C. -I'm kind.
the assignment was to write about Bruegel. I did that.
no, what you did was copy Strauss. -I was referencing an expert.
if I wanted to know what he thought, I'd buy his book.
miss Watson, with all due respect...
bruegel was a storyteller. Find the stories.
break them down into smaller pieces. You might actually enjoy it.
you're giving me another chance? -So it seems.
is that my file? What's it say?
well, let's see.
straight A's. -Until now.
president of the poetry society, captain of the debate team...
...co-captain of the tennis club, founder of the horticulture league.
I sound like a pompous ass. -Yes, you do, but a very busy one.
and it says here that you're pre-law. What law school are you gonna go to?
I hadn't thought about that. After I graduate, I'm getting married.
and then? -And then I'll be married.
you can do both.
just for fun, if you could go to any law school, which would it be?
Yale.
Yale.
they keep five slots open for women， one unofficially for a Wellesley girl.
but you haven't really thought about it.
wake up, Joanie, wake up. Wake up.
okay, don't get up.
don't hear what I have to say about Tommy and Spencer...
...Iooking at an engagement ring.....for you.
you're sure?
that's everything we always wanted， huh?
we'll be best friends, and our husbands will be best friends...
...and we'll have houses together and we'll have babies together...
...and they'll be best friends.
you're going to be Mrs. Tommy Donegal.
when?
I'll get the scoop tomorrow. You go back to sleep.
the first part of the exam will consist of two pairs of slides.
please identify each of the slides by name, period and date.
then compare and contrast them.
you will have 10 minutes for each pair.
then you will write a 1500-word essay...
...describing the stylistic differences between Raphael and van Eyck.
eyes forward, Miss Delacorte.
you have 40 minutes.
good luck.
excuse me. -Governor. Another shot， please.
this way, please. Thank you.
excuse me.
this is quite the event.
I'm surprised I was invited. -Well， look around you.
who wasn't?
you ever hear the expression "Keeping up with the Joneses"?
of course.
Mr. and Mrs. Gordon Jones.
the actual, historical family they invented the phrase about.
good to know.
that's him!
thank you. -Good to see you.
thank you very much. -A beautiful dress.
Hi, we're so glad you came.
we're together. Table 1 9. -Good.
holy God!
the governor is right behind you. Don't turn around.
great band.
violet. -Yes?
would you mind if I go here? -Not at all.
over here. Thank you.
great band. -Great band.
Hi, Katherine. -Hi， Professor Dunbar.
I'm getting a Manhattan. Like anything?
no, thank you.
I'll take a Jack and ginger.
he's making his move.
I knew he'd go for her.
she's too old for him.
she's too smart for him.
hold that.
they're playing our song. -What?
they're playing our song. -I heard you.
Hi. -Hi, Giselle.
ladies' choice? -Sure.
excuse me.
ladies, gentlemen! Quiet!
what's this about the poem you wanted me to read?
lt was your idea, remember? -I never said that.
ready?
excellent.
well, I wrote this down， just in case you forgot. It's my favorite.
smile.
now, Betty, I tried to think of a million ways to tell you how I feel.
but instead...
...I prefer to your favorite poem.
good catch. -You said it.
he's a morsel. Miss Watson!
he's a favor. Remember? -Come on.
miss Watson, I want you to meet Tommy.
Tommy, come here for a second.
you are so beautiful.
this is Katherine Watson. -Oh, wow! In the flesh.
she has not shut up about you. -Oh， stop.
you know what I'm saying? -I do.
you did something to impress her. -Well, it seems you did too.
you make these especially well. -Thank you.
I had a fella. Lenny.
you remind me of him so much.
he had this...funny little thing where his two front teeth...
...they overlapped.
he's dead.
south Pacific.
my parents say my future is right on the horizon.
tell them the horizon is an imaginary line...
...that recedes as you approach it.
I think I'll go back to my seat.
I had a really nice time. Thank you.
Connie.
ls this the brushoff? -No.
I thought you were， you know.....done with me.
why would you think that? -Betty said that you.
I don't wanna take advantage. I know that this was some favor.
she did me the favor, not you.
come on, dance with me.
she's too good for you.
maybe you're right.
I'm too good for you too.
but I have lower expectations. -I thought we settled this last spring.
so then we probably shouldn't have slept together over the summer.
stop.
you ready?
do you wanna know something funny?
Lenny's not dead.
not technically.
he...
he's got married.
he's got a wife and kids...and a mortgage.
it was all supposed to be mine, except for the wife.
and you... You don't look a thing like him.
you ugly bartender. -Stop it.
you couldn't shine his shoes. -I'm sorry.
it wasn't supposed to turn out like this.
it wasn't supposed to turn out like this.
which way? -Let me just see here.
I'm not sure.
where are we supposed to go? -I think it's here.
come this way. We're almost there.
Joe.
hello. -Hi. How are you?
great. Thank you so much for this. You're a pal.
it's a pleasure. Your timing is perfect.
there it is.
that's Jackson Pollock. -ln a word.
I was getting used to the idea of dead， maggoty meat being art, now this.
please don't tell me we have to write a paper about it.
do me a favor.
do yourselves a favor. Stop talking and look.
you're not required to write a paper. You're not even required to like it.
you are required...to consider it.
that's your only assignment today. When you're done, you may leave.
thank God Betty isn't here.
where did you come from?
Mars.
what a coincidence.
Tom Donegal came by to see Joan. So I hopped a ride.
Why?
so I could do this:
Katherine. -Yes?
have you got a minute? -Of course.
walk with me.
you going home for the holidays? -No.
too far? -Too expensive.
but I've never had a New England Christmas, so...
our weather hasn't scared you away? -I love it here.
do you?
I've been getting some calls about your teaching methods, Katherine.
they're a little unorthodox...for Wellesley.
we are traditionalists, Katherine. -Yes， I noticed.
so if you'd like to stay here...
ls that a question? -More a discussion.
about my staying here? -You'll have your formal review in May.
until then...
...a little less modern art.
happy holidays.
and to you.
afternoon. -Oh, hi
I hope you get that ring!
Bye, girls, see you next year. Have a safe trip.
so, what's the big hush-hush secret?
are we gonna hear the pitter-patter of little Spencers?
stop. They'll tell us when they're ready.
are you ready?
is she the cutest? You are the cutest. Come here, you.
Spencer's been made junior partner.
lt is about time. -And it's a significant raise too!
Betty! -What? I can say that, can't l?
to Tommy and Joan?
well, it is. So maybe a family isn't far behind.
let's take our coffee in the sitting room, shall we?
I'll help.
keep them closed. -All right.
beautiful! You've got everything you've ever dreamed of.
you will too.
I've got a secret to tell you. You swear you won't gab to anyone?
I got accepted early to Yale Law School.
to what?! Why?! You don't want to be a lawyer.
maybe I do.
you won't switch cold creams without asking me， but you applied to school?
on a lark. We never thought I'd get in.
who's "we"? -Miss Watson.
she practically filled out my application for me.
you've got to be kidding me! What right does she have?
you're getting married!
first of all, there's no ring on this finger.
second, I can do both. I can.
how does Tommy feel about this? -He doesn't know. No one does.
not even her? -No one.
Joanie! Betty!
you are this close to getting everything you ever wanted.
and this close to losing it.
I just got a call. They need me in New York tomorrow.
Joan and Tommy are here. Can't you leave in the morning?
then I'd miss the meeting. Sorry， guys. We take a rain check?
sure, buddy. -We'll see you in the new year.
happy and merry.
I'll call you in the morning.
coffee?
guess who has an early Christmas present?
Oh, my! How can you live like this? -Like what?
we'll just wait for you to tidy up a bit.
in this lifetime? It'll never happen. Come here, beautiful.
what are you doing here?
you still like it here? -I do. I like getting to know the girls.
most of the time.
and the weather. -Yeah, the weather's nice.
are you freezing? -Yeah.
your lips are a little blue. -I like them that way.
why didn't you bring a coat?
bill.
Giselle, what are you doing here?
freezing.
look, it's over. I can't see you anymore.
I can't. -I know.
really.
I just want to talk to you for a minute.
come on.
Oh, I missed you.
you're beautiful.
life without you...just isn't life.
and I don't want to go through life not living. Do you?
no.
I love you so much I would move to this elitist icebox if you want me to.
miss Watson?
Hi. I didn't know you were here.
Giselle Levy, Bill Dunbar， this is...
this is my... Paul. -Fiance.
as of about a minute and a half ago. Paul Moore.
God. Congratulations! Your fiance?
you must be thrilled.
I don't think she's caught her breath yet.
I haven't.
well, sit down. We'll have a toast. -We'd love to. We're in a hurry.
but that's really great. Congratulations， old man.
Congratulations. Merry Christmas. -Come on, let's...
best of tidings to you both. Bye.
no, Paul.
Nancy'll have a heart attack. She has these rules.
come on. -No.
Why? -I said no. I'm not comfortable.
I'll make up the convertible sofa.
what are you doing?
you're not kidding?
I just came 3000 miles to see you. I'm sleeping down here by myself?
stop. Stop. Stop for a second.
tell me what the hell's going on. -I don't know.
I feel like everything is getting away from me.
we haven't actually, literally looked at each other for three months...
...and now you're here, and I have this ring on my finger.
which makes you uncomfortable too?
the last time I checked, we weren't on this track.
when was the last time you checked?
bill...
the name is Paul.
I'm not saying no to you.
no, you're not saying anything.
you never really do.
if you need me for anything else, my number's on the refrigerator.
I feel so guilty leaving you alone after
I'm fine. I have lots of research to do.
that's right. Throw yourself into work.
I'll be back...on the 2nd.
see you next year.
sunflowers. Vincent van Gogh. 1 888.
he painted what he felt, not what he saw.
people didn't understand. To them, it seemed childlike and crude.
it took years for them to recognize his actual technique...
...to see the way his brush strokes seemed to make the night sky move.
yet, he never sold a painting in his lifetime.
this is his self-portrait.
there's no camouflage， no romance. Honesty.
now, 60 years later, where is he? -Famous?
so famous, in fact, that everybody has a reproduction.
there are post cards-- -We have the calendar.
with the ability to reproduce art, it is available to the masses.
no one needs to own a van Gogh original.
we do. In the Newport house.
but it's small. Tiny.
they can paint their own. Van Gogh in a box， ladies.
the newest form of mass-distributed art:
paint by numbers.
now everyone can be van Gogh. It's so easy.
just follow the simple instructions...
...and in minutes， you're on your way to being an artist.
van Gogh by numbers?
Ironic， isn't it? Look at what we have done to the man...
...who refused to conform his ideals to popular taste.
who refused to compromise his integrity.
we have put him in a tiny box and asked you to copy him.
so the choice is yours, ladies.
you can conform to what other people expect or you can
I know. Be ourselves.
you're a sight for sore eyes.
I would've been on time but, silly me, I thought class was in the classroom.
glad you could join us， Mrs. Jones. We thought we'd lost you.
there's an unwritten rule for marr-- -Don't bother.
since your wedding, you've missed six classes, a paper and your midterm.
well, thank God I didn't miss the paint-by-numbers lecture.
I was on my honeymoon and then I had to set up house.
what does she expect?
attendance.
I'm pregnant.
you're pregnant?
Oh, crap.
I can't believe it's over.
me, neither.
there is one way to end a relationship, and that is quickly.
you got to get it over with. Otherwise, it rots.
don't sit in a rotting relationship, Ann.
I can't believe this
23 years old, I got to move back home with daddy.
next time somebody's doing my job and they trash Trish, why don't you tell them that you're sleeping with her before they stick their foot in their mouth?
a life of an actor is full of constant rejection and a life of uncertainty.
I mean, you knew what you were getting into.
you're from Brooklyn, right?
Uh-huh, Bay Ridge.
where are you from?
Oh, I'm not prepared to tell you that.
you want me to ask him if he likes you?
Yeah.
okay.
you will?
I'll pass him a note in homeroom.
Rosie, why didn't you tell me you had a new boyfriend?
he's not my boyfriend. He's just a friend.
that's what we like to hear.
so, is it "lay" or "lie"? I always get that wrong.
it's, um...
it's "lay.
Hey, Rose.
Oh, my god. Is that Alex?
do I have time to run to the bathroom and hide?
been looking for you.
hmm, not really.
Hey, man.
hey... man.
Hi.
Oh, don't worry. I love a girl who's not afraid to fight acne in public.
Thanks.
did you read the short play I wrote for theater night?
of course I did.
Oh, my god, it was so just there.
I mean -- what I mean is your dialogue was so really... real.
succinct.
you, uh, you need a comma after "succinct.
and that is all the genius I can give you.
Organic-chemistry homework calls.
later, guys.
Bye.
so, has anybody cast your other piece yet?
Oh, I wouldn't expect anyone to. I'm just a first year.
don't sell yourself short. You're making an impression.
I don't know if it's the talent or the Hello Kitty socks.
um, so, who'd you cast?
well, I'm playing he.
obviously. So, who's playing she?
I'm not sure. I'm still looking.
Oh, what kind of actress are you looking for?
superhot would be good.
superhot.
basically I'm trying to figure out who's right and who's interested.
Oh, well, I'd be interested.
not that I'm saying I'm superhot, especially not right now, but I would definitely be interested.
that is, if you're interested in me being interested and if interest makes up for any lack of hotness or superhotness.
well, that's good to know.
I'll keep that in mind.
I give Bob one book on pregnancy and he's turned into the prenatal police.
P. S. -- Do not let him know I ate a hot dog on the way here.
who are you looking for? - Nobody.
Oh, my god. You're looking for Danny.
no, I'm not. - Oh!
besides, there are thousands of people here. I couldn't find him if I tried, and I am not trying.
I didn't invite you here tonight so you can obsess over Danny.
okay, sorry.
no more looking. No more obsessing.
although I don't know why he gets our James Taylor tickets.
honey, I got you better seats.
Yeah, I mean, but he could've split them with me.
but then you'd be next to him, and it'd be like a date.
shut up.
I bet he is on a date, probably with Megan.
who's Megan?
little miss hot hostess from the restaurant.
you know, the slut that seats people? Her.
or he could be with some other slut.
all the more reason not to look.
exactly.
Oh, my god. There he is.
what? Oh, my god, I thought you weren't gonna look.
I swear, if he is with Megan, I'm gonna
Oh, my god.
he's with dad.
what are you doing? - Give me this!
Hey!
that's your slut?!
Hi.
hello.
not that I'm assuming that this is you or anything, but w-why is this in the microwave?
that's kind of a long story, Bob.
the good news is I didn't burn down your apartment.
hello.
concert ended already?
no. We just, uh, decided to come home early.
is that a burnt bra? - Yes, it is.
I'm protesting. Guess what against.
did you eat a hot dog?
you're like a bomb-sniffing dog.
Hey, who wants to watch "the making of the 'House of wax'" -- Bob?
that sounds riveting.
but, no, I'm gonna read chapter four of "paternal prenatal prepared.
Oh, Bob, please don't read any more books.
if you gain any more expertise, I'm gonna need an epidural to endure you.
Oh!
all right, don't freak out. How do you get red wine out of a rug?
Ooh, Marjee, I know -- you start off by going back to Brooklyn!
okay, okay, okay.
tonight she needs to go. - Okay, okay.
I heard that, Bob.
okay. Marjee, you have to go home tonight.
Ginnie, listen to me -- you have no idea how bad it is at home, okay?
as if living with "perkoleptic" Renee wasn't bad enough, now dad's gotten into this new jag of reminding me "what a huge disappointment I am."
I didn't send you to college so you could throw parties for a living."
you better get your act together. - I'm very sorry he's not being supportive.
thank you.
now go home. - Ginnie!
look, you don't understand.
if you do not leave tonight, Bob is going to divorce me.
and I'm barely prepared to be a mom, much less a single mom.
why don't you just ask Ann if you can stay at her house?
I already did. She said no.
that's how I learned that asking in advance is a bad idea.
Oh. Out!
Ginnie, come on.
Where's that soft, maternal side I love about you?
don't get mugged on the subway.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
so, you got the part in Alex's play, huh?
Yes, I'm she. I'm she!
I'm she! I'm she! I'm she!
looking forward to working with you.
Yeah, me, too.
I'm she.
well, I brought a lot of cheese.
no, no, this is fantastic. - No such thing as too much cheese.
even though you kicked me out of your apartment, I still brough the cinnamon buns.
buns, buns!
Ooh, darling, no brie.
see, soft cheeses contain unpasteurized milk.
it's not good for the baby. - Oh, fine.
I'm gonna prepare you a nice, fresh spinach salad.
get your folic acid for the day, all right?
Hey.
what does this remind you of?
something else Bob won't let me eat.
look -- it's the leaning tower of Pisa.
Oh.
we have this client -- he's planning this anniversary party for him and his wife.
they met when they were climbing the leaning tower of Pisa, so I just had this idea -- I could make a leaning tower of Pisa cake.
look at you working on the weekends.
Hey. I brought the coffee.
sucky decaf for Ginnie.
see, daddy, look.
this is what I do.
you stack cinnamon buns.
I design cakes. Well, I mean, that's part of what I do.
that's great. You could go to culinary school and become a pastry chef.
I don't need to become a pastry chef, dad, because I already am a party planner.
what, I'm just trying to help you find a career where you can use skills like these.
I have a career, dad. How come you're never on Ginnie or Ann for what they do?
an attorney and a therapist are jobs I understand.
forget it.
I think I handled that well.
Hey, dad... about last night...
sorry I called you a slut.
Hey, I grew up around fiery italian women.
slut" is a good day for me.
it's just that last night was the first time I've seen Danny since we broke up.
and to see you there with him, I just felt like
like I was on his side instead of yours.
Yes.
but now that you say it out loud, it sounds really stupid.
no, honey, it's not stupid.
I should've thought it through better.
I'm sorry.
Hey, it was James Taylor. How could you not go?
but if he invites you to Carly Simon, please say no.
it's a deal.
what's up?
what are you doing friday night?
that depends. Are you calling me for a favor or for something fun?
I'm starring in a play. Alex cast me.
who's Alex?
Alex Brody. He wrote it and he's starring in it with me.
Oh, Alex Brody. Do I smell a boyfriend?
no. Anyway, I'm starting a phone chain.
I need you to call Ann and tell her...
rose is starring in a play with her new boyfriend, so call and tell Ginnie, but do not tell dad.
why not?
cause Rose is afraid... - Dad will be too judgmental.
Oh, but he'll so want to come.
I know. That's what I said.
he's barely on board with me being in theater as it is.
I have to make sure the first thing I invite him to is amazing.
otherwise he's going to doubt the choice I've made and force me to switch back to pre-med.
okay, we won't tell him, but...
only if you tell us whether Alex is your boyfriend.
shut up. I'll see you friday.
Hey, Ann. - Hey, Megan.
just here to see Danny.
Oh, he's in back. Do you want me to go grab him for you?
no, I can grab him myself.
slut.
Hey, Ann.
Hey.
some of your mail has been straggling through, so I thought I'd drop it off.
Oh, thanks. I put the forwarding notice in at the post office. I guess
Yeah, well, what can you do? Your mail still wants to be with me.
anyway, um... I wanted to apologize for the other night.
I was caught off guard, and I overreacted.
Yeah, I just wanted to take your dad to the concert.
I know, and he really enjoyed it and I know how much he misses spending time with you, so I'm really sorry.
excuse me, Danny? Can I borrow you for a sec?
he'll be right there.
so, uh, so we're cool?
Yeah, we're cool.
she gets on my nerves.
rose. Hey.
Oh, my god, Ann.
guys, this is my sister Ann. Ann, this is
Yeah, hi. - Hi.
what are you doing? - Having lunch.
here?
Danny gives us free sandwiches.
so what?
if this is about the money, I could give you 20 bucks.
I don't get it. What's the problem?
the problem is you don't have lunch at your sister's ex-boyfriend's restaurant.
Hey, I'm sorry. I know you guys are in the middle of a fight
and coming from a crazy family, I respect that
but I will kick myself if I don't do this.
I'm Zach.
Oh, you think this is funny?
I don't. It's just that -- - No, no, no. No, laugh it up.
it's hysterical, right?
Yeah, go eat your fricking free sandwiches.
Oh, and by the way, when you're in acting class, maybe you can learn how to act like a real sister.
I didn't mean it, Ann. I'm sorry.
nice meeting you!
so Jason will incorporate the white orchids you want for the place settings.
in the entire room. Which will give the place a magical feeling.
and we're all set.
great.
and the leaning tower of Pisa
stroke of genius, Trish.
Oh, thank you.
that's why you pay me the big bucks.
that's why you pay me the big bucks.
should I remove sharp projectile objects from your reach?
sorry. I know she's your girlfriend.
but can I not get acknowledged for one lousy leaning cake?
it's not a lousy cake, and you'll get acknowledged. Just be patient.
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
are you kidding?
it took six months before Trish gave me credit for being a good kisser.
up until then, I was just the lucky guy who happened to be in contact with her magical lips.
how do you even deal with that?
I know I'm a good kisser.
just like you know your ideas are good.
well, thank you.
but I think I'm just taking it extra hard 'cause I got to go home and deal with my dad.
your dad?
Yes, I lost my apartment, so now I got to live in Brooklyn with my dad until I find a new place to stay.
Yeah, you know how that is on the self-esteem.
well, hey, if you need a temporary place to crash, why don't you stay at my place?
what?
I've got this great one-bedroom in the village.
but I'm practically living here with Trish, so I'm never there.
I have a spare key. You want to take it?
this is the part where I'm supposed to say, "no, I couldn't possibly. That's way too much.
but, uh, yeah, those words just are not gonna come out of my mouth.
I got to get downtown to pick up some supplies and I probably won't be back for the rest of the day.
so, my apartment is at 142 Jane Street. It's number 6.
God, Jason, thank you. I-I don't even know what to say. Thank you so much.
Oh, and try not to kill Trish. 'Cause if you do, I'm gonna need my place back.
Ah, ow! What's going on?
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
wait a minute.
what am I doing on your side of the bed?
Oh, yeah, it was really weird because when I went to bed last night, you were on my side, so I had to sleep on your side.
but I never sleep on your side of the bed. I always sleep on my side of the bed.
I like to sleep on my right side, facing towards you.
Oh, my god.
what happened? What happened?
you moved me.
no. Unh-unh.
you moved me to your side of the bed so that when I turned in to face you,
I'd be sleeping on my left side.
nutrients to the placenta.
it's better for the baby.
do you know what else is better for the baby?
me not killing its father before it's born.
darling -- - No, no, no, no.
don't "darling." I can't take this anymore, Bob.
you won't even let me sleep like a normal person.
last night you wouldn't even let me take a bath.
but the book says that hot baths are bad for the baby.
I did not take a hot bath. I took a warm bath, Bob.
but, hey, while we're at it, why don't you just stick a thermometer up my ass every four minutes so that the baby doesn't overheat?!
I love you.
if I could just walk out that door.
free will.
free will won't help me.
that door won't help you.
okay, stop.
look, this totally isn't working. I'm not feeling drawn in.
I-is it me? Am I not doing it right?
no, no, no, it's not you. It's both of us.
I'm just not feeling the magnetism. Maybe we should stage it so we're closer together.
no, Alex, I like that you're at opposite ends of the stage.
then you're being drawn together despite the consequences.
but something has to connect us.
it's what's underneath the words. It has to be palpable from us to the back of the theater.
what if you take your clothes off?
very funny.
what? I'm totally serious.
and totally not helping.
wait a second. Let's think about that.
what?
maybe that's how we should do it.
I like it. We could try it.
she says "free will" and starts to undress.
it draws me to you. The pull is magnetic.
but she doesn't move.
you're kidding, right?
you want me to be totally naked?
I'm gonna be naked with you.
you're talking to a girl who used to hide behind her locker door when we had to change for gym class.
look, don't overthink it. The, uh, the nudity in this piece is symbolic, not literal.
so we're not gonna take our clothes off?
no, of course we are. That's just not what the scene is about.
that's what the scene's going to be about to my family, who's going to be in the audience, looking at m-m-m-m-my everything.
your "everything" is totally beautiful.
and if your family's freaked out by you expressing your art, that's their problem.
say the first part again?
you're beautiful, and you're talented, and you're my leading lady.
so, we're gonna take our clothes off, and we're gonna make this play great.
together.
okay.
yo, Alex.
we need you to go over the light cues.
I'll be right there.
catch you later.
okay.
check out the wet bar.
Oh, that's right -- you're not really the wet-bar type till Mr. or Ms. Sorelli-Spencer junior pops out.
how are you paying for this place?
I'm not.
that's what's so great.
it's more like a house-sitting gig.
rose? - Yeah, it's me.
all right, come up.
Ooh, who's miss strike-a-pose?
Trish as in "oh, I hate my boss" Trish?
this week, she's "I steal Marjee's ideas and pretend they're mine" Trish.
so you're house-sitting for your boss.
Mnh-mnh. It's her boyfriend's apartment.
so you're house-sitting for your boss's boyfriend?
Yeah. What? What's the -- what's the look?
Marjee, please tell me you're not sleeping with him.
w-what? No! God, why would you even say something like that?
I don't know, maybe because you constantly have a habit of getting into relationships with totally inappropriate guys.
again with the look. God, can anybody just have a little bit of faith that maybe I'm not a totally self-destructive mess?
Hey, guys. - Hello.
Wow. Who are you sleeping with to get this place?
I am not sleeping with anybody.
okay.
so, is Ann coming, or is she still mad at me?
why is Ann mad at you?
she saw me going to have lunch with some of my friends at Danny's restaurant and she got upset.
I tried to apologize, but
Oh, sweetie, Ann is not mad at you.
I'm having dinner with her tomorrow night. I'll make sure everything is okay.
how are things with the boyfriend's play?
first of all, he's not my boyfriend. And second of all, about the play, now that we've started rehearsals, I'm realizing it's kind of a work in progress.
so, I don't think you guys should come.
what?
but it's your first show ever. It's a big deal. We want to be there for you.
look, please, I'd really rather you didn't come.
but I don't
I don't think you're gonna like it.
but why? - Because.
because why? - Because there's some nudity in it.
Oh, my god. X-rad theater? We're going. We're going.
and the nudity involves me.
what do you mean, the nudity involves you?
one of the scenes in the play requires me to take my clothes off.
all of them?!
don't give me the look.
you said you were going to take your clothes off in a theater full of people.
what look would you like me to give you?
just listen -- it's a really good play, and the nudity isn't literal, it's symbolic.
and -- and if you guys have an issue with me expressing my art, well, that's your problem and not mine.
I'm just glad you didn't invite dad.
I know. You guys have to swear never to tell him.
because if he finds out, he's going to freak and make me quit the theater program.
I swear. - Swear.
yummy.
sorry.
I know you hate saltines. I know you hate me being the pregnancy patrol.
the prenatal police. - Yeah, that, as well.
and, you know, I don't want to police or patrol or "P"-word you in any way whatsoever.
but every night, darling, like clockwork you
well, you vomit 20 minutes after we've gone to bed, and I've heard that crackers really help.
so, I thought, you know, seeing as we're gonna be pregnant for a long, long time, we might as well try and have a little less upchucking.
who's having this baby, Bob?
we are.
let's do this again.
who's carrying this baby in her womb?
well, you're the one with the uterus, but
exactly -- I'm the one with the uterus.
so, if I would rather upchuck than eat saltines, so be it.
sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm
just this new-dad thing, you know,
I'm desperate to get it right.
I know, but you need -- - I need to back off at least 50%.
try 95%.
95%? Bloody hell.
Ohh.
you okay?
no, I'm not.
Bob?
Ann, is that you?
I'm coming down.
wait. Buzz me up. I have to go pee before we go.
no. Why come all the way up? I'm on my way down.
we'll hop in a cab and you can pee at the restaurant.
I can't hold it till 74th and Broadway.
I'm coming down.
Oh, hold the door.
thank you.
Oh, come on.
Ohh!
holy cow. Oh, my goodness.
Hello? Ohh!
Hello, Ann. Ginnie went down there to meet you.
I know, but my bladder's gonna burst.
uh, wait.
I can't wait.
Oh, my god.
Ann. Oh, my god.
this is why you wouldn't let me pee?
Ann, sweetie -- - Don't "Ann, sweetie" me.
I can't believe my entire family is seeing my ex-boyfriend behind my back.
wait a second. This is not Ginnie's fault. It's my fault.
I bought the college-football package, and I hate watching the games alone.
no, I'm the sister. I'm the one that should be yelled at.
no, you shouldn't.
Bob, it's okay. - It's not okay.
I'm saying it's okay. - It's not okay!
okay, stop it!
Bob's right. I shouldn't be yelling at you.
I should be yelling at you.
what?
you, me, on the terrace. Now.
don't you have to pee?
my anger absorbed it.
anger absorbs pee?
I don't know why this is such a big deal.
Bob called me to come watch the game, and I said okay. It was that innocent.
right, and the concert with my dad and the free sandwiches with Rose.
do you have any idea what it feels like to know that my family can spend time with you, but I can't?
you're right.
I'm being totally selfish. I'm sorry.
you know, I...
I remember the first time you invited me for -- for Christmas dinner...
and I looked over at the fireplace and there were no stockings, just a line of your snow boots with the names attached
an extra one at the end -- "Danny.
you have no idea how excited my dad was to finally put another male boot up there with his.
that's the first time I ever really felt a part of something.
your family, it's the only family I ever...
and your dad
I know. You're like the son he never had.
and don't ever tell Bob I said that.
I know I got to cut the cord, and I'm gonna do it. I promise.
I'm sorry if I hurt you.
that's the last thing I ever wanted to do -- ever.
Oh. Will you do me a favor?
rose invited me to her play on Friday.
could you just tell her I couldn't make it?
no.
what?
no, I can't tell her that.
Annie -- - 'Cause you should be there.
what? I-I-I thought we just -- - I know. We just
one thing that I have and you don't is family.
sometimes it's easy to forget just how much that means 'cause I never have to think about it, you know? They're always there.
but you don't have that, and I can't just take that away from you.
I don't know, Ann. - Yeah, well, I do.
and, hey, who knows?
maybe someday I'll even get used to seeing you around and you and me and all the Megans in your life will all be friends.
think we could do that?
no.
Yeah, Trish, I got the Bauer bite.
no, I did not get the nonfat chicken. They didn't have them.
I got the low-sodium liver.
okay, then I will go back tomorrow.
all right. Trish, I really got to go.
okay, all right. Goodbye.
Oh, god!
they put dogs to sleep. Why can't they put their owners to sleep?
are you okay?
God... Jason.
I didn't mean to catch you off guard.
I didn't know you were here.
sorry I didn't call ahead. It's just, I left my cellphone at Trish's.
and since she's been yelling at me all night, I decided it wasn't worth going back to get it.
how has Trish been yelling at you all night? She's been yelling at me all night.
she's the queen of multitasking.
I'm mooching your vodka. I will totally get you more. I swear.
Hey, don't sweat it.
but you better drink fast 'cause I am way ahead.
Oh, well, better put on your drinking shoes, 'cause the 100-yard vodka dash just happens to be my gold-medal event.
Uh-huh? - Uh-huh.
Cincin. - Cincin.
there you are. How was your doctor's appointment?
Oh, it was great, yeah. No worry.
well, what happened? What did he say? Why are you throwing up?
you have a stomach virus or flu?
what was it?
nothing.
well, Bob, nothing doesn't make you spend the night throwing up in the toilet.
Bob, what's going on?
all right.
I got a sympathetic pregnancy.
you have a sympathetic what?
sympathetic pregnancy.
don't even say a word, all right?
it's a real condition, actually. It's called couvade syndrome.
and, you know, lots of men get it.
lots of men develop the same symptoms as their pregnant wives
you know, weight gain, morning sickness.
it's our way of -- hmm
it's our way of taking part in the pregnancy.
you know, it's, uh, it's normal.
Dr. Tabbar says not to worry because all the symptoms will disappear when our baby is born, so...
Oh, my god.
we're pregnant.
Yeah.
I'm serious. You totally saved my ass on that one.
you totally saved my ass at the crush magazine premiere.
no way. You totally had that one under control.
please! - I threw in a few optional design ideas.
fine, then you only half-saved my ass. - Oh, so I owe you half an ass-saving.
damn straight. Don't think I won't be collecting on that.
what are you doing?
I don't know.
I can't believe Trish doesn't give you credit for being a good kisser.
what? What? No. I'm -- I'm sorry.
it's okay. - Oh, my god. No, it's not -- it's not okay.
this is why she gave me the look. - What?
Ginnie. I got to go.
no, it's my fault, really. You don't have to leave.
all right. Here's what we're gonna do -- this, it never happened, okay?
and thank you for letting me borrow your apartment. And the vodka
I will replace the vodka. I mean, not here, obviously. I'll leave it on your desk.
just someplace where it's not weird, you know, but it's easy for you to find.
God! Where are your keys?
um... on the floor?
on the floor. Okay, good, so now you have them, and I don't have them anymore.
and I will see you tomorrow, Jason, at work with Trish, with your girlfriend and my boss.
and this never happened. I know I said that already.
okay. I got to go.
and I'm sorry if your rug smells like treats or liver or whatever.
I cannot believe you kissed your boss's boyfriend.
only kissed him. I can't get credit for anything.
Hey. - Hey.
are you okay?
I'm working on it.
okay.
I can do this.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god, why are dad and Renee here?
I don't know. I surely didn't invite them.
neither did I, and we know Rose sure as hell didn't.
Oh, my god. Oh my god.
rose sent me the flyer. I left it on the kitchen counter when I left this morning.
you what?
how could you leave the flyer out?!
maybe if one of my sisters would let me stay in their apartment,
I would not be kissing my boss's boyfriend and leaving flyers out at dad's house
maybe.
stop kicking yourself.
I just wish she felt comfortable enough to invite us in person.
you know, it's my fault
being so hard on her, not showing support.
the important thing is that you're here.
after the show, we'll go backstage and she'll know you're here to support her.
she'll just be so thrilled that you came.
okay.
okay, everybody, places. Don't make me say it twice. Let's go.
ready to go?
um... um... on stage or out the building?
great.
now what?
pray someone in the audience knows CPR.
what do you want me to do?
help me.
I've done everything I can.
I know, I just...
look at her.
she is a total natural up there.
Oh, if I could only walk out that door.
free will.
that's my Rose.
free will won't help me.
that door won't help you.
W-w-w-what? What's the hell's going on?
don't be upset. Remember, it's art.
it's art?! It's my daughter!
Shh!
when did her boobs get bigger than mine?
there's never been a moment of regret.
Ooh. Wow.
all right. I got to get out of here.
Joe, you said you were gonna support her.
that was before I realized my daughter was in a porno play.
excuse me, sir, but could you please sit down?
you're blocking a very important moment in my life.
Joe, no hitting!
my life.
my love.
Whoo!
ow, ow, ow!
Whoo-hoo! Nice!
did you guys really like it?
Oh, are you kidding me? You were so good.
like you were on stage a million times. You were amazing.
Hey, when did your boobs get bigger than mine?
Marjee. - No, when?
I'm sorry. I had already invited Danny and
don't worry. It's okay.
you were really great.
Thanks.
so, has anyone seen dad?
it's my fault. Rose, it's totally my fault.
I left the flyer out on the counter. I'm sorry.
just hit me, you know? Just hit me hard. I deserve it. Please.
Marjee, it's okay.
has anyone seen him?
no, honey.
I think he left.
Oh.
well, that's okay.
there she is.
that's all the Italian I know.
you were wonderful, just super.
Joe, here she is.
Hey, dad.
well, I guess I know why I wasn't invited.
dad, it's not that. It's
no. I got two things to say, and I'm gonna say 'em.
first of all, you should all thank Renee for not letting me slug the kid behind me who was ogling my youngest daughter.
and second, to be honest with you,
I came here tonight thinking, "so, I'm gonna see Rose in a little play.
but, honey, you have got something really special.
and as hard as it's gonna be for me to let go of the whole med school thing,
I think you made the right choice because you are really talented, and I am so proud of you.
Thanks, dad.
in fact, you were so good that I actually forgot you were up there in your birthday suit.
uh, do you mind if I steal the star of the show for just a minute?
Oh, my god, it's the famous Alex.
Yes, you can steal me. Please.
that was really great, dad.
you made my mascara run.
I can't believe she was naked!
what is it? Where are we going?
I just wanted to thank you, Rose.
you were incredible.
on stage, you were beautiful and magnetic and...
everything I could've asked for.
Hey. Flash said I'd find you guys back here.
um... I'm sorry.
no, no, it's okay. We were just, um
I just -- - No, no, it's okay, man.
I was just telling Rose how great she was.
and I have to go say hello to some people before they take off.
um... he was right. You were really, really great.
like, the kind of great that made me realize you definitely don't belong in organic chemistry lab.
Thanks.
anyway, um... in celebration of your first performance as a truly amazing artist,
I, uh, brought you these.
roses.
Yeah, I did a little research, and yellow stands for the promise of new beginnings, so...
Thanks.
this really means a lot to me.
do you want to go grab a bite? Celebrate?
yo, Sorelli Alex wants your mug out front for a cast picture. Don't make me say it twice.
sorry, I got to go.
no. No, no, no. It's no big deal.
actually, I have to go home and study anyway.
I have a major exam tomorrow on the reproductive cycle of fungus.
I'll try not to be jealous.
I know how tough that is.
coming.
Bye. - Bye.
thank you.
you did really great with Danny tonight.
I know. I think I'm actually gonna be okay.
Oh.
baby, there's a cab on the curb, meter running.
man!
what's wrong -- - It's nothing. It's nothing.
listen, coffee tomorrow in the park. No Bob, no baby talk.
just you and me, sucky decaf.
you, me, sucky decaf. You're on.
Hey, aren't you Rose's sister?
I introduced myself the other day on the sidewalk.
you were yelling at Rose.
Oh, my god, I am so sorry.
apology accepted... if you'll have a drink with me.
excuse me? How old are you?
old enough to have a fake I. D.
Yeah, okay. Good night, Zach.
old enough to spot an incredible woman despite the fact that she won't give me the time of day because of my age.
it won't hurt to talk to me.
Hey. I thought you left.
Yeah. I just thought I'd have a drink.
Oh, yeah, nothing like a plastic cup of $7 chardonnay.
what's up?
don't know.
just, uh...
Yeah.
you let go of a good one.
the thing is, um...
I'm not so sure I want to let go.
Yeah, well...
until you do know for sure
so, quick, while Sylvia's still in line, how she's doing without Daniel?
she's still stuck in the wounded stage.
when she's ready for anger, I am so there. - Me, too.
my dad left my mom.
Prudie is no stranger to marital disappointment.
actually, we're fine now.
you're married? But no ring, huh?
Yeah, it's this hand, and... I teach French.
you teach French, so you wear your wedding ring on the right hand?
it's a European custom. - Are you European?
so Prudie, you haven't said which book you wanna be responsible for.
maybe Persuasion.
cause I'm increasingly drawn to its elegiac tone.
don't think I'm doing the book club. - You're doing it.
you lead one discussion. Pick a book.
well, I just saw Sense and Sensibility, and I think, since I'm back living with my mom,
I really get that whole two-women, tight-relationship, living-together- but-really-opposites thing.
is it weird living back at home again?
I think what Austen is actually writing about is two sisters, moving separately toward what they each believe to be a perfect love.
okay, but the point is Marianne and Elinor's relationship...
maybe if you'd read the book instead of watching the movie...
I thought I might do Emma. - Which leaves what for Sylvia?
Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park.
which one's gonna make her feel better?
because we're only doing the book club to get her mind off Daniel.
I thought the reason for the book club was for my not going to Paris.
exactly. - Northanger Abbey.
no, don't make her do Northanger.
I mean, first you're going off to all these dances, and then suddenly it's sort of like nightmare on Northanger Abbey Street.
I'm afraid this isn't the book club that I had in mind.
I mean, I find when someone in the group feels superior to the author, it just... It sets the wrong tone.
okay, I'm happy to leave.
no, Allegra. No. Allegra. No. - Allegra, you can't. You can't.
after this day, I am so happy to be talking about Jane Austen.
Hi. - Hi. Did we choose the books yet?
Sylvia, Prudie.
Oh, I'm sorry. Sylvia Avila.
so, how do you feel about Mansfield Park? - My favorite.
I love Fanny Price. - Stop, Mom, why?
she's such a goodie-goodie.
six books, five people. We skip Northanger Abbey.
definitely. - And miss out on Mr. Tilney?
no, you're right. - He's such a flirt.
we don't have to do all six books, do we?
doing all six novels is the reason of the book club and it is the only reason I'm here.
okay. - Do you wanna invite your husband?
my husband has never read Austen and he never will.
okay, how should we do this?
just meet once a month at each of our houses, potluck...
or, you know, pick some central location.
no, I don't think a coffee shop's conducive.
I'll host the first one, we'll start with Emma, at my place.
but let's not get into this competitive cooking thing.
Bakeoffs!
no, we'll do finger foods. - We're gonna do takeout.
and we have to create the Jane Austen mood.
Oh, my God. - Hey.
he came. - Yeah.
sorry, I sat in the wrong Starbucks for half an hour.
golly, there are a lot of these places, huh?
but they've got interesting coffee from all over the world, so...
this is Grigg, everyone. - I'm Bernadette.
Prudie. - Prudie, and Allegra.
Sylvia. - Grigg Harris.
Hi.
well, I'm excited.
never read anything by Jane Austen before.
what is it?
well, I went to the bookstore to buy a copy of each one of the novels, and I saw this.
and I thought, "Well, maybe they're all sequels."
so, I figured it might be a good idea to keep them all together in one book, in case I needed to refer back.
is this the order that we read them in?
do you wanna grab a coffee, Grigg?
no, no. No, I'm fine. I had plenty at the other place.
and... I bought this and they filled it up for me, so I'm a little...
Yeah.
Oh, you said in your email there was someone you wanted me to meet?
Yeah. Yeah, all of us, actually.
I thought we might benefit from the perspective of a male in the group.
a little testosterone. - Right.
okay. So, none of you ladies are married? - Prudie.
right, so we just... What? We just read them chronologically, and...
we're doing Emma first. - Emma?
Oh. Starting in the middle, huh?
they're not sequels. - They're not?
well, great. We just start anywhere.
what were you smoking? - He's cute.
I thought he'd be a distraction for Sylvia.
she needs an adventure. If he becomes a problem I'll get rid of him.
what happened, you pull a DUI? - No, no, I pretty much bike everywhere.
where do you live?
about 20 miles north. Vista Mar.
you live in what, that development? - Yeah. Yeah.
I had this software company and my accountant says to me, "You gotta buy a house."
so, we were right by that exit.
and I said, "Pull over."
got out, went in, pointed, bought a house.
like that. - I should sell it, I guess.
or at least buy some furniture.
well, I guess I'll have to, if you guys are coming over, right?
Allegra.
Bye. - Yeah. Sayonara.
you know, I never picked a book.
could I do that Abbey one?
perfect. Yeah, it's yours. - Oh, Northanger Abbey.
great. All right.
Emma. Starting in the middle. - Yeah.
well, you gotta hand it to him for taking the dud book.
it's the shortest, that's why.
he's eager to please. - Prudie, see you next time.
he is eager to please. He likes women.
a welcome quality in a man. - Yes. Yes.
do you think Sylvia responded to him? - We let him in. It's done.
Bye. - Bye. Bye.
you're up.
go big!
you okay?
Hey. Hey, you. Listen.
can you make sure they don't call my mother? Please.
just make sure they don't call my mother.
Mrs. Avila? This is Corinne.
I'm a friend of Allegra's. - Allegra's.
and she's asked me to call you.
we're up here in Vacaville at a...
jewelry show. ...jewelry show.
I was showing her how to use my scooter and she took a little spill.
it's minor. She banged up her wrist.
she doesn't need you to come. It's nothing. We're at the doctor's.
he says she could be a bit sore.
Allegra didn't want you to worry if she's not home tonight.
I'll remind her. Book club Monday night.
I'm sorry.
we don't shop on this side of town, ever.
sorry.
you can have this Whole Foods. We won't ever use it again. Okay?
so I was getting the wine for book club and I bumped into Daniel.
he was with her.
Oh, sweetie. - Yeah.
they were going home to make dinner.
he was wearing a jacket with a zipper.
no. - That's so not Daniel.
I just... I walk around this house, and it's not my home anymore.
I feel like Fanny Price banished from Mansfield Park.
that woman is living my life. - Honey, she can't live your life.
are you all right?
I know you like being alone, but don't you ever get Ionely?
so what'd you think about Grigg?
the book club guy.
if you like him, I like him.
how about those dreamy eyes? - I didn't really notice.
well, notice.
can you come early tomorrow since you're bringing the wine?
that's my girls. That's my girls. That's my girls.
it's a smallish world, pedigreed Ridgebacks.
pedigreed is... - Well, it's breeding.
certain bloodlines are naturally more valuable.
mine are out of Queenie of the Serengeti. Gorgeous hound. Gone now.
I bred her to my first really important sire, Pridey.
Sire's the boy dog. Great disposition. Passed away last month.
I'm sorry. - Thank you.
miss him. But Queenie was the real star.
ridgebacks are matriarchal. That's one of their attractive features.
Hey, hey, hey! Sahara, off!
sorry. Sorry about that.
sahara I had to have spayed. Thyroid issues.
I still show her, though. She's very competitive in her category.
yeah? - Sexually altered bitch.
well, I got you those books.
you know the ones I suggested? Ursula Le Guin.
Oh, yeah. Thanks, that was thoughtful.
you don't have to bring a hostess gift to these meetings, FYI.
it's just a book club.
Where's the heat between Emma and Mr. Knightley?
there's no animal passion.
look at Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax.
you can tell they're really in love because they behave so badly.
and that's good?
Emma and Mr. Knightley, you just never feel the sex.
still, I think Mr. Knightley's very yummy. Don't you?
he may be my favorite of all the Austen men.
that's not Jane's theme, is it? - Jane?
that's cozy.
what we're meant to see is not the lack of passion so much as the control of it, and the not giving in.
but Prudie's right, it is in all the novels.
sense and Sensibility, obviously.
Oh, and then there's Maria's infidelity in Mansfield Park.
I forgot there's infidelity in Mansfield Park.
Austen's all about keeping it zipped.
Yeah, but isn't physical attraction one of the ungovernable forces?
you know, like gravity. That's what we like about it.
you know, downhill, release the brakes, loosen your grip, and...
Yeah. Love makes people crazy.
it does not excuse bad behavior. - I agree.
and Mr. Knightley is violently in love. "Violently!" His word.
and yet, he's never anything but a gentleman.
Yeah, a gentleman who scolds people. - Not everyone.
you know, just Emma, just the woman that he loves.
a man can do whatever he likes to the woman he loves.
I don't think that's what Austen's saying.
actually, Emma stops being crazy when she falls for Mr. Knightley.
it's the event of the book. Love is an act of sanity.
one thing that I noticed about Emma is the sense of menace.
the gypsies, Jane Fairfax's boating accident,
Mr. Woodhouse's worries.
Austen's entire thesis is that none of these things are real, Grigg.
I mean, Emma, she acts on the basis of her fantasies.
Yes, Grigg, I'm afraid you've just entirely missed the point.
you know, I've read that the Emma plot, the humbling of the pretty, know-it-all girl is the most popular plot of all time.
Yes, universally satisfying.
okay. Well, what bothered me was how Emma kept forcing her friend Harriet on Mr. Elton.
and then she finds out who Harriet's father is, and suddenly, "Ew!" She's lucky to get the farmer.
I think Jane was being ironic there. I think some readers might miss that.
Emma's a snob. - Please.
people are instinctively drawn to partners who are their near equal in looks.
the pretty marry the pretty, the ugly the ugly.
to the detriment of the breed, in my opinion.
God, you're such an Emma. Isn't she?
you'd love to pair up the whole world, from dogs to people.
put me together with Daniel.
and you had beautiful children.
Oh, no, don't get up, Jocelyn. I'll get the tea. Sorry.
mom.
I hope we didn't scare Grigg away.
Yeah, he sure got out of here fast. - Yeah, we'll toughen him up.
was the book club a bad idea?
Austen has a way of making you forget that most marriages end in divorce.
well, she's all about the weddings, Jane.
Yeah, "Jane." Did you catch that?
Oh, Prudie? "Jane and I, we know our themes."
and why did she have to speak in French?
and if so, couldn't she do it in France, where it's less noticeable?
I feel for Prudie. She's married to a complete Neanderthal.
okay, I will call you when I land in Dallas. You know what?
let me call you when I check in the hotel if there's time before the game, - 'cause we're gonna wanna get there early. - Whatever, okay.
have fun with your mom.
Hey, Sky. Hi. - Hi.
mom, you were supposed to sit with the car.
I'm gonna get a ticket!
yo! - Get some ass!
so... Hey, what're we doing today?
well, I'm teaching. It's a school day, okay?
so I'm gonna drop you at the house.
or you can take the car and you can go see a movie or something.
no, no, I'll hang with you. - No, no, you can't.
they don't allow that.
mom, could you... Oh, my God, please.
okay, I can't.
mom, I'm late. Please. Come on.
Oh, ditch them. Blow them off.
tell them your mother doesn't wanna hang around while you go to work.
what's the story with the clothes? You dress like a flight attendant.
no, I dress like a teacher. Or it gets confusing.
mom, mind your stupid... For everyone.
why would anyone wanna teach high school?
I hated my teachers.
well, I'm just gonna settle you at the house.
no, I'll drop you at school and then I'll take the car.
should you be driving? - Huh?
okay, you know what? Just don't forget to come get me at 3: 00.
okay? Don't forget.
I'm in Brigadoon. Would you mind running lines with me?
of course. I'm all right.
"I'd have died if anything had happened to you."
"I love you so."
"but how can you be sure in just one day"?
"I dinna know, tis just when a lass falls in and out of love, she knows it right away."
what? - It's a good accent.
well, languages are my speciality. I just thought that...
french teacher.
it's your line.
"do you think you're in love with me"?
"Think? What good does thinking do"?
"but what I feel is something else."
"what do ye feel then, Tommy"?
and then we kiss.
who plays opposite you?
Karen Bhave.
I think she only tried out because she thought we'd hook up during the play.
I saw you watching me in the library.
I wasn't watching. - You were watching.
no, I was reading.
you were watching. - I was reading this...
I was reading this book... - Oh, yeah?
...About some people in this house called Mansfield Park.
Austen. - Yeah.
we're doing Mansfield Park for senior seminar, so...
I actually bought the book already. I'm trying to make myself wait, you know?
delay gratification. That sort of thing.
so what happens? - Right, well...
well, they decide to put on a play in the house.
and rehearsing it, it sort of unleashes them.
two of them actually fall in love, and one...
one of them, Maria Bertram, is set... Stop it.
is set to marry someone else. - Or maybe not.
well, I think... I think...
I think what Austen is trying to say is that play-acting is dangerous.
all of that intimacy backstage, the waiting and the whispering, and onstage you're gazing at each other, and "I love you."
I mean...
well, you can see how it happens.
Yeah, I can see it happening, just not with Karen Bhave.
so, do you wanna go over it again?
Hello?
Yeah. - Hey, Grigg, it's Jocelyn.
Hi. Hey. - Hi.
so how's Mansfield Park coming? - Just great.
am I disturbing you?
I'm just writing an email to my sisters about you, as a matter of fact.
and Ursula Le Guin.
did you ever read Left Hand of Darkness? - Not yet.
Hey, listen, Bernadette and I were just saying we hope Allegra didn't scare you off the book club.
which one is Allegra? - Sylvia's daughter.
really pretty, really passionate, wonderful girl.
ask him if he can make time today.
you might take Sylvia to lunch today.
tell him that Sylvia and Daniel are in court this morning over their separation.
she could use the ego boost.
you have Sylvia's number, right?
would you wanna come, too?
listen, I know there's a difference in your ages, but I really think the two of you will hit it off.
sahara. I gotta go, okay?
this woman I like definitely seems interested, but it's weird.
she's sort of pushing me to date this girl, Allegra, who's way younger than me.
she said I should take this girl's mother to lunch.
bank assets will be divided equally.
each individual will keep his or her own car, and each will be wholly responsible for the attendant payments and insurance.
the house owned by Daniel and Sylvia will be jointly held, with both parties paying an equal share of property taxes, upkeep and repairs.
Sylvia may live in the house. Daniel will not.
as soon as Daniel hit 50, his wheels fell off.
here's what I get from Mansfield Park.
that a marriage is only as strong as its weakest partner.
Daniel has always wanted to find his center by wobbling.
this is a pretty big wobble.
Mansfield Park is full of wobblers.
lady Bertram lying around, letting a houseful of adolescents run riot.
Fanny Price is the rock of that family.
Fanny's cousin Maria, married six months, dumps her husband...
and don't forget Fanny's father, the unemployed alcoholic.
marry the weak link and you're screwed. That's what she's saying.
no wonder why Austen never married. It's terrifying.
I think I finally hate him. - Good.
I'm home. I'm going out again. I have book club.
you just missed this guy who got buried up to his neck in a tank filled with cockroaches.
and they were real.
you'd think it'd be illegal to show stuff like that.
here, grab a spoon.
you have to leave.
you put your things in your suitcase 'cause I'm booking your flight.
want me to... - Yeah.
how did you break it? - I fell.
which was kind of lucky, actually.
cause I met this girl, Corinne, who I've been seeing. She's a writer.
which, um, isn't so great, really, 'cause if she had to choose between me and writing, she'd probably choose writing.
but she doesn't ever have to choose. So you never have to know.
so you're a lesbian. Full-time?
you mean, do I ever slip and accidentally sleep with a man?
no, no, my sister Cat, she goes out with guys and girls.
she lives in Idaho.
your sister isn't Cat Harris.
you know her? - Bernadette knows everyone.
I met her through my doctor friend in Laguna Niguel, Bianca Sillman.
you know my sister, Bianca?
I forgot that Bianca and Cat are sisters.
those are your sisters!
our world is an English village.
my topic is the long-suffering daughter.
one can't help but see the parallels between the long-suffering Fanny Price in Mansfield Park and the long-suffering Anne Eliot in Persuasion.
I hate Fanny Price.
excuse me, we're not electing the homecoming queen, okay?
I mean, yes, if this were high school, yes, we all know Elizabeth Bennet would be most popular and that Fanny would be least.
who's Elizabeth Bennet? - Of Pride and Prejudice.
don't give away too much, 'cause I haven't read that one yet.
you don't know Pride and Prejudice? - No.
I think I read somewhere that Fanny Price was Austen's favorite.
Fanny's boring. - She's faithful.
she's Horton Hatches the Egg.
she sits on that nest and she never, ever wavers.
well, she'd probably be easier to like if she would just allow some weakness in others.
she doesn't allow it in herself. - True.
I didn't see what was so bad about Henry Crawford.
Yes. Thank you, Grigg. Why does it have to be Edmund?
well, Austen, she's always suspicious of people who are too charming.
just once I'd like to pick up Mansfield Park and see Fanny end up in the sack with Henry Crawford.
Yes! Yes!
you can't read these novels without wondering if she doesn't have a little thing for the naughty boys.
well, who doesn't?
except for Fanny Price.
okay, look. I love Fanny. She works hard.
she puts her family's needs above her own. - Mom, it's okay.
and she never, ever stops loving Edmund, ever.
even when he's stupid enough to do something like take up with Mary Crawford.
Oh, dear.
I thought Mansfield Park would be safe, didn't you?
I don't think we're gonna get through all six books.
reading Jane Austen is a freaking minefield.
you're awfully quiet, Grigg. Any thoughts?
Yeah.
Yeah. Yes!
the relationship between Edmund and Fanny.
they seemed like brother and sister.
but then in the end, it's like The Empire Strikes Back, but it's in reverse. You know? 'Cause in Jedi, Luke Skywalker, he gets over Princess Leia when she turns out to be his sister.
Edmund gets over Miss Crawford and gets it on with Fanny, who's his first cousin, so...
did that bother anybody else?
weren't you gonna call Sylvia for lunch? - Oh, yeah.
you know Allegra's gay, right? - Of course.
Oh. I love your furniture, in your house.
and before we do Northanger Abbey, I gotta buy a couch, so...
is something going on between these two? - Grigg, you have to...
would you come with me, help me pick it out?
if you take Sylvia to lunch.
great.
good, that's great.
okay, see you. - All right, yup, here.
take care. - Oh, God. Sorry.
I caught him staring at my titties.
I like that.
I like this. - That color's difficult.
I like things that are difficult. I'll take it.
wait, you just don't buy the first one you like.
you don't even know if it'll fit. - What? It's fine.
you getting hungry?
Grigg, I don't mean to be rude, but may I ask, do you have a lot of money?
never know how to answer that.
Yeah, I have enough money.
but, you know, I like working in tech support.
may I? - Sure.
you should bring Sylvia here. It's so romantic.
you know, she's planning this library fundraiser.
she's busy. - Call her.
it's hard to be alone.
well, maybe her husband will come back. - Maybe.
Jane Austen should write that.
she did. In Persuasion.
Anne Eliot is in love with this guy Wentworth who's in the navy, right?
but her family thinks that he's not good enough.
right. - So he leaves.
and when he comes back he's become this wealthy man.
but he's no longer in love with her. - Okay. Don't tell me any more.
Oh, so you're enjoying the Austen, I see. - Yeah. And how's the Ursula Le Guin?
you didn't like Le Guin? - I didn't read them.
how are you gonna know what you like unless you try?
I think at my age I should know what I like.
age? Come on, age.
age has nothing to do with anything.
I was willing to read girly books like Jane Austen...
she is not girly.
which I found out.
so maybe you would find out that science fiction's not just...
aliens on rocket ships. - Right.
all right, hurry up and finish. I'm gonna show you something really cool.
what you have to understand is that when I was a kid, my dad and I were basically surrounded by girls.
you know, there was my mom, my sisters, and their friends.
so there'd be like 15 girls in the house. It was insane.
my dad would hide out in the shed and no one was allowed back there.
and he'd listen to ballgame, you know, smoke his pipe.
he actually died a couple years ago of mouth cancer.
I'm so sorry. - Anyway, one day...
I'm like 10 years old, my dad takes me back to the shed and he shows me some magazines that he keeps back there.
he says, "This is strictly guy stuff. It's top secret. Very private."
"tell no one."
Yeah, so from then on, it's like...
I don't know... It's like me and my dad and science fiction.
these were like the first books that I fell in love with, and I never got over it.
Arthur C. Clarke. He's a visionary writer.
theodore Sturgeon. Amazing.
philip K. Dick. This was my top-secret all-guy world.
Andre Norton. - Very manly.
except, as it turns out, Andrew Norton, a. k.a. Andre Norton, - a. k.a. Alice Mary Norton. - No way.
James Tiptree. - I heard of him.
real name, Alice Sheldon. Pat Murphy.
Patrice Anne... - You were still surrounded.
but by that time I liked girls.
you win. I'll read the Le Guin.
great.
tell me a secret. - Your turn.
no. You have better secrets. You can trust me.
tell me.
okay, but this is not something I would tell anyone else.
there was this special needs kid in the grade above me, Benny.
he wore his hat squashed down really low, and his ears stuck out.
and he was always carrying around this basketball and going...
and, one day, I was in fourth grade,
I saw that he was holding his penis.
so, I just went back to my friends.
well, later my dad picked me up.
and he was distracted, just not really listening, and...
and I don't know why, but...
I said, "Dad, this boy at school made me look at his penis."
wait. What was his name? - Benny.
we actually got their address and drove to their house.
and Benny's mom answers the door. I mean, she was old.
she has these two long, skinny gray braids. And my dad's yelling.
and she starts crying. "I'm sorry, what do you expect me to do?"
and he says, "I expect you to speak to your son."
and then right behind her is Benny with his stupid basketball, going...
and my dad just stops.
cause he had a little brother like that who died.
Oh, my God.
so we get back in the car and my dad is just silent.
and then he says, "I think you knew you were leaving out the most important part."
and I just felt horrible.
you know, I didn't really know any of that was gonna happen.
I just wanted his attention.
have you lost your mind?
I thought about... I thought about calling.
I... But I didn't wanna wake you. - You can't just show up here, Daniel.
somebody's gotta mow the lawn. I don't mind.
well, I'll pay somebody.
you know? I mean, this is my home. You cannot just arrive here without asking.
what if I had somebody staying over?
are you seeing someone? - Put the mower away.
I didn't mean that in a weird kind of way.
I just missed hearing what's going on here.
Allegra, she acts like she hates me, and the boys... I mean, Diego and Andy, they call from school, but they don't say much.
they're ashamed of their father.
so Diego says you told him the handle on the shower's loose?
thirty seconds. - I'll deal with it.
is there something in the house you don't want me to see?
do you think I'm not taking care of the house?
no, no... - You wanna do what a husband does?
you wanna fix things?
you can't fix this.
you're not my husband.
all that's gone now. - Can I call you next weekend?
no, you cannot call me next weekend. - Okay.
I'll check in with you, okay?
my mom said I could buy a motorcycle if I paid for it myself.
it's her one stipulation, right?
so I work at the mall.
and I have that whole Kerouac thing planned for this summer, and now it's, "No."
I'm 18 years old. I have the right to buy a motorcycle.
but you had a motorcycle once.
and you ended up hating it.
remember, Trey?
remember? You used to park it on the other side of the gym.
it was red and black. And...
you got really tired of taking care of it.
What're you talking about?
that was my mom's technique when I wanted something.
she'd say, "But you had a birthday party last year."
remember? We had a big cake "with pink icing and roses all over it."
and you hated it.
and she was totally messing with you?
it got her out of giving me a birthday party. - Wow.
I mean, I have wonderful memories of balloons and ballerinas and rollercoasters.
and it never happened. That's pretty messed up.
we certainly can't have a big party like that every year, can we?
so, when did you finally figure it out?
well, by then she had this other trick.
so suggest something to me. Something you'd like to do.
okay. Um...
let's get a room.
let's not get a room and just say we did.
then we give up?
you weren't a very persistent kid, were you?
Trey, you really shouldn't come on to me. - Why?
because you're a teacher?
I... We can't do this.
let's get out of here.
we'll go back to my place. We'll just talk.
let's not and just wish we did.
I don't wanna pretend.
um, we're late.
just give me a second.
God.
does this place seem creepy? - It's quiet.
wow, Sylvia, you look great! - Hottie!
it's the new me.
Hey, how's Corinne doing? - Great.
so, are we up for Grigg's amazing insights on Northanger Abbey?
stop it. He might surprise you.
I hope his couch has arrived. - Oh, I don't mind sitting on the floor.
passing around cans of aerosol cheese? - Stop it. Fine.
Grigg is a grownup. I'm sure he's made it very nice.
all right.
welcome. Please come in.
whoa. - Grigg? Whoa!
apparently, he thinks it's Hallowe'en.
no, it's Northanger Abbey! It's Gothic! - Right!
no one gets out alive!
I don't like this. I don't like this. - Sylvia, Sylvia!
Grigg? Grigg? Grigg? - Sylvia, it's a joke.
he's just having fun... - Oh, Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia!
it's okay. It's all right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
look. - It's a send-up of Northanger.
it's a program. - Bernadette, that's your phone.
this is my remote. And everything's on sensors.
Prudie? Oh, hi, Dean. Is Prudie running late?
what do you do on Hallowe'en? - Oh, Hallowe'en is big.
Hallowe'en is much, much bigger. You should come over for Hallowe'en.
wait. - Oh, that's terrible.
I got inspired reading The Mysteries of Udolpho.
you know, the book in Northanger Abbey that Catherine's obsessed with reading?
you read The Mysteries of Udolpho? - Food!
Hey, Grigg, that color almost works. - When did you...
he read The Mysteries of Udolpho. - Wow.
wait, that book they were reading in the book? That's a real book?
Yeah, with the black veils and Laurentina's skeleton.
didn't you think that sounded great? - Yeah, it sounded awesome.
Dean, I'm so sorry. Prudie must be devastated.
Prudie said to ask you.
she's supposed to talk or something, about some book?
persuasion.
we don't know how long we're gonna be down in San Diego, so...
she may have to cancel.
tell her we'll save Persuasion for the end.
it's better to do it last, anyway. It was Austen's final book.
I thought Northanger Abbey was the final book.
written first. Published last. - That makes much more sense.
Why? - What happened with her?
cause it's a novel about novels.
you know? You see Austen as the young writer, questioning herself.
who's a heroine? What makes a good story?
are novels a waste of time? Am I gonna write? What should I write about?
I like that. - That's actually very perceptive, Grigg.
Thanks.
Prudie's mother died.
what? - Jesus.
she got into her car yesterday, this was in San Diego.
she made a left coming out of a parking lot into oncoming traffic.
Jesus. - Terrible.
were Prudie and her mom close? - Well, there was tension.
what do we think? Is Persuasion too depressing to take on right now, with the dead mother and everything?
she doesn't die on the page.
even Sense and Sensibility, the dad dies.
what about Pride and Prejudice?
I could use a little encounter in the woods with Mr. Darcy right now.
are we all up for a little romance? - Ready.
I think we're all overdue. And it'll be better for Prudie.
I still can't believe you read The Mysteries of Udolpho, Grigg.
Bravo, Grigg. Bravo. - Yay for the grilled artichokes.
you can move in with us any time, Grigg. - Please, don't bring skeletons.
she loves these.
are you and Grigg seeing each other?
no. He's interested in Sylvia, obviously. That was the plan, right?
I don't wanna fight, okay?
I don't know why you didn't just take her back to the car and have sex with her. I mean, clearly you wanted to.
I talked to her... I talked to her for like five minutes.
longer. Longer, Dean.
and with those ridiculous plastic boobs. Is that what you go for?
Prudie, you know, I was just trying to be nice to your friend.
okay. Chloe Baher is not my friend, Dean.
Chloe Baher came to my mother's funeral to gloat. "Ha-ha! Your mother's dead."
and you hit on her!
I do... I do... - You hit on her!
I was not hitting on her.
you know, when I was in the 10th grade,
I wrote an entire paper on Julius Caesar in iambic pentameter.
and Chloe Baher removed it from my locker and she read it aloud to the whole class.
and everyone laughed at me.
baby, high school's over.
high school's never over.
and turning 'round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me."
I am in no humor at present to give consequence to young ladies "'who are slighted by other men."
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, "for you are wasting your time with me."
you know, I don't know if we can do Pride and Prejudice next week, because it's the library dinner.
well, we need to go for Sylvia. Daniel's bringing Pam.
that's so unnecessary. - Tell me about it.
his firm's buying a table. - Well, then we should buy one.
all of us, the book club.
show up in force. - Yes.
"the Central Valley River City All Jane Austen, All The Time Book Club,"
is what Grigg calls it.
he's so funny. I'm so glad he finally made a date with Sylvia.
he's taking her to lunch.
I sure hope there's some dancing in this thing.
I'm trying to diet.
my husband is bringing a date to my fundraiser.
Yeah, re-reading Pride and Prejudice again,
I keep thinking, "You know, courtship is easy."
Where's Austen's novel on divorce? - I wouldn't say it was easy.
depends who you're courting, I guess.
does Jocelyn ever go out with anyone? - Occasionally.
she used to date my husband in high school.
then she sort of gave him to me.
Daniel's the one that first bought Jocelyn a dog.
she traded your husband for a dog? - Look, I adore Jocelyn, but...
if loving is letting go, then whoever wants Jocelyn is going to have to pry her fingers loose, one by one.
Hey. - Hi.
Hey.
do you know Lynne from my writing group?
I don't, actually. Allegra. - Hey.
listen, I just have to say, you have been so good for Corinne.
ever since you two have been together, she's been writing nonstop.
didn't you just love that story that she wrote last week?
well, Allegra and I don't discuss what I'm working on.
okay.
"dear Ms. Corinne Mahern, we regret that we must decline to publish the three short stories you sent us."
"Benny's Basketball" is strong narratively, "but the depiction of your penis-waving retarded boy felt a little unkind."
and isn't the title "Separating Eggs For Flan" a bit obvious "as a metaphor for your parents' divorce?
yet we confess that "Skydiver" puzzled us most.
why would a beautiful, self-centered young lesbian jump out of a plane?
I thought we could drive together.
we should hurry. I don't want Sylvia sitting there alone.
sahara, off. - Sylvia's already at the library.
she said she had to get there early. - So you offered her a ride first.
no, she happened to mention it at lunch.
that's a great dress.
stay.
I converted it to biodiesel. So it basically runs on donut grease.
this is so great. I never get to drive it.
or vacuum it, apparently.
I like your hair.
you need to dance with Sylvia tonight.
you do know how to dance, don't you? - Of course I do.
I have three older sisters. I can dance.
wait, if we stay in this lane, we're gonna be late.
given that I have to convert donut grease into biofuel every time I fill up the tank, I just try not to drive very fast.
we're barely moving.
you ever read those Le Guin books I bought you?
I prefer books about real people.
okay, so Elizabeth Bennet is real and people in science fiction aren't.
is that it?
science fiction books have people in them, but they're not about the people.
real people are complicated.
well, there's all kinds of science fiction.
when you've read some, I will be interested in your opinion.
why are you getting off here? - I enjoy seeing the river.
what are you, Mark Twain?
now we're gonna get stuck at every light.
look at the talent in this room.
half the Silicon Valley is here.
to romance.
Hi. - Hello.
I'm planning on meeting a software baron and moving to Pemberley.
well, everyone knows a rich man is eventually going to want a new wife.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm Dean.
Yeah, he's not doing book club with us.
uh, moral support. She's had a rough couple of weeks.
well, you're welcome to join in, Dean. - Nah, that's okay.
I think I'll just head to the bar. Let you ladies talk.
there is no bar. It's a library.
serving liquor. - Well, that'll work.
you guys need anything?
we had this big fight on the way over here.
have some champagne. - Mom?
I broke up with Corinne.
Oh, my God. Honey.
nice. - We have plenty of time.
honey, whatever happened between you and Corinne, you don't just walk out.
you don't even know what she did. - Did she hit you?
did she say cruel things?
you are so quick to love. You're too quick.
you jump in, you jump out. That's Daniel in you. Quick to act.
it's not working? Well... Fix it. Or break it. Who cares?
we don't just dispose of people we love. You stay. You repair.
okay, you know what? This is not you and Daddy.
this is Corinne. The difference being that Daddy actually loves you.
so you go repair. Power on.
maybe Daddy'll give up this woman he's been fucking.
Allegra. - But Corinne, I'm dumping the bitch.
we're gonna be so late. - I'll call a cab.
I will not let Sylvia be alone when Daniel walks into that library with Pam.
you got your phone?
I'll find a payphone.
are you attracted to Sylvia?
Yeah, she's, um... She's nice.
she's more than nice. She's smart and funny...
and she's in love with her husband. - Well, she needs to get over that.
why don't you stop interfering? Let Sylvia work out her own life.
it's interfering to want my best friend to be happy.
if that's interfering, I hope I never stop.
what about me? Am I your friend?
or am I just some widget to help you make Sylvia feel better about herself?
why did you invite me to be part of your book club?
what went through your mind the first time you saw me?
there's a man who is dying to read every book Jane Austen ever wrote.
is that what you thought? - No.
but I thought, "What a beautiful woman. I hope she looks over at me."
I thought if I read your favorite books that you would read mine.
but, no, no, no. You just wanna be obeyed.
that's why you have dogs.
for such a famously romantic story,
pride and Prejudice is a parade of bizarre marriages.
I've had every marriage in this book.
my first husband was a politician. He was embarrassed by every move I made.
he said I was rude and loud.
"stop pointing your breasts everywhere," he'd say to me.
I was 17. I was Charlotte Lucas.
I married the first man who looked at me.
you don't see your own marriage until it's too late.
so, um... I actually thought that Charlotte Lucas was gay.
really, I think that when she tells Lizzie she's not as romantic as she is,
I think that's what she means.
Charlotte Lucas is not gay. She's not. She just... She just has no options.
wait. Austen meant Charlotte to be gay or Charlotte is gay and Austen is not aware of it?
I just love the idea of a character having a secret life that the author doesn't even know about.
you know, frankly, I kind of admire Charlotte for looking at her situation and deciding to marry Mr. Collins.
I mean, yes, yes, she knows he'll never be the "love of her life,"
but that's okay.
that is exactly the reason that Jocelyn would hate her.
Jocelyn has contempt for anyone who settles for anything less than the perfect love.
you know, it's probably why Jocelyn has never married.
my apologies, everybody.
hello. - Hi.
we ran out of donut grease.
Grigg Harris. - Dean Drummond.
wait, Grigg... Grigg from the book club? - Yeah.
no, it's just Prudie would say "Grigg," and I just didn't picture it as a guy.
so you thought Grigg was a girl?
Dean thinks "Austen" is the capital of Texas.
Wow.
you'll notice that Jane, she never shows what happens after the wedding.
maybe Elizabeth and Darcy start hating each other.
maybe Lizzie went off to Pemberley, and she turned into this crazy person, like her mom, because our mothers are like time bombs.
they just... They tick away inside of us.
let's not give Mrs. Bennet more importance than she deserves.
you know, I mean, what about the father? - What father?
you know, my mom showed me a picture of a guy in uniform.
well, maybe she made him up.
or maybe she bought it at a garage sale.
and I kept it in my room, this...
I kept it in my room.
let's not do this now, okay?
Dean, I got it.
Bernadette.
Daniel never came.
good.
I'm in love with one of my students.
but I mean, nothing's happened. Much.
but it could.
it could, if I let it.
I fantasize about him constantly.
sweetie, your mother died. This is grief.
he looks at me like he's the spoon, and I'm the dish of ice cream.
it's a good thing we're reading Sense and Sensibility next.
I love you so. - But how can you be sure in just one day?
I do not know. 'Tis just when a lass falls in or out of love, she knows it right away.
you think you're in love with me? - Think?
what good does thinking do but what I feel is something else?
Hey, you got your cast off. - Yeah.
how does it feel? - Great.
you can reach it. Just really stretch your arm out.
there you go. Just give the rope a little bit of a shake.
you can do it, there... Can you put your...
can you put your right foot in that blue thing?
it's gonna be fine.
here, hang on. - You can reach it.
just reach up. - It's caught.
it's okay. You're doing good.
I'm totally okay. I'm not even hurt. It's nothing.
I'm sorry, I have to stop you here.
it's not likely to be anything more than a concussion.
I'd like to keep Allegra under observation for a few days, okay?
and if you need to reach me, I'm Dr. Yep.
how many times have we had to come here to get her stitched up?
it's always Allegra, never the boys. - Well, she's the one who goes mountain climbing and skateboarding and snowboarding.
it's a miracle she never tried parachuting.
she's so extreme.
one minute she's crazy in love with Corinne, the next minute she's never hated anybody more.
she's gonna be okay, right? - She's fine.
she just took a knock on the noodle.
this is gonna sound, probably, horrible, considering the fact that she's got this lump on her head, but... It's just...
it's great to have us all in the same room again.
just feels so normal.
normal, yeah.
you know, I haven't been seeing Pam for a couple of months now.
so, that must be a big change.
you know, I was thinking just this morning about this book club that we're in, Allegra and me.
the first meeting was...
Yeah, we had just been separated. 'Cause Allegra had just moved in.
and I was realizing how different I feel.
I don't think I'm the same woman that you left.
I can see that. I so see that.
well, it's probably the same for you.
I guess that's what happens when you let go.
we did a good job taking things apart.
I'm kind of proud of us.
I'm warning you, if Grigg starts making little remarks, I'm gonna walk out.
you two just keep it together for one more book.
I wish he'd just drop out of the group.
Austen sets up this juicy triangle between Elinor, Edward and Lucy Steele.
and then at the end, she practically has to whip a rabbit out of a hat to make Lucy Steele run off with Edward's brother?
Yeah, that requires some hand-waving. - I think the ending's well-plotted.
to me, the part that seems forced is Marianne ending up with Colonel Brandon.
anyone else feel that? - Oh, I have no problem with that.
he rides up on a big stallion, sweeps her into his arms. I'm there.
from the time Colonel Brandon meets Marianne, he just lavishes all this attention on her.
and meanwhile, she's throwing herself at Willoughby.
Willoughby is a player.
women never go for the nice guy.
please. Men say that, but you get to know some of these men who complain the most, you find out they're not as nice as they like to think they are.
okay. You know what struck me?
is that Colonel Brandon is only a few years younger than Mrs. Dashwood.
well, why does he take up with the daughter and not the mother?
Yeah, why not Mrs. Dashwood?
maybe Mrs. Dashwood won't give him the time of day.
the book is about the young people. - Yeah, because Jane Austen thinks that nothing interesting can happen to a woman over 25.
when actually, a novel about a woman seducing a slightly younger man just yields so much more.
well, then maybe Mrs. Dashwood should go for Willoughby.
why not?
it's a long, hot summer.
maybe Mrs. Dashwood has more sense than that.
okay, can I just point out, she's hardly in the story.
sex is messy.
maybe Mrs. Dashwood prefers a more well-ordered life.
maybe that's why she's such a minor character.
I think if you read Austen's novels... - Oh, I have.
you wanted me to, and I did.
I think you'll see she always writes in favor of order and self-control.
nothing unwise. - Nothing in haste.
okay, so, this is... This is what, this is a rulebook?
we could do worse.
I think Jane Austen wrote about women falling in love because she was Ionely.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong.
Austen lived a very full life. She could've gotten married anytime.
she almost did. - That's right.
but she decided not to. - Why, too messy? Too out of control?
his name was Harris Bigg-Wither, and they were engaged for one night.
"Oh, Harris Bigg-Wither!" I can't believe you know that.
I understand why Colonel Brandon goes for Marianne.
and it's not 'cause she's young.
it's because she's generous with herself.
she's willing to risk her heart. No rules, no fear.
and Willoughby tramples her. - She just picked the wrong guy.
no rules, no fear.
I like that.
Hi. - You're wearing that to your book club?
it's Bernadette's idea to do this beach day, 'cause in the novel they all go to Lyme, which is, you know, like, the beach in England.
this is your last one, right?
I think we're gonna do some more books after this one.
Prudie's gonna be hours late and Grigg called. He's bringing a woman.
thank God it's the last meeting.
Yes, there's getting to be a little too much plot.
not that I blame Grigg.
something about reading Austen sort of makes you wanna get it on.
Hi.
started reading it with Allegra at the hospital. This is a great book.
are you joining our discussion?
am I? 'Cause I'd like to. - Hi.
Daniel wants to join us. - Well he's not in the club, is he?
Oh, come on, this is my favorite Austen. So far.
it's all about mistakes and second chances.
Yeah, you can stay.
glass of wine?
I can't believe he brought a date to our last meeting.
I kinda had him in mind for you, as a fling. - For me?
honey, I took your boyfriend away from you in high school.
look how that turned out.
Hi. - Hey.
how ya doing? - Guys, this is Cat.
hello. - I'm Grigg's big sister.
Oh, God, that's wonderful. That's so... I'm... God, that's wonderful.
you're Grigg's sister. I'm Jocelyn. This is Sylvia.
how are you? - Hi.
good, thank you. - Hi. Bernadette.
I don't believe it. - Look at you!
you look great. - Good to see you.
thank you.
wow, are you visiting from Idaho? - Yeah, yeah.
we kept seeing these emails. And we said, "What kind of strange power "do these women have that they got Grigg to read Jane Austen?
just thought I'd check it out. You wanna take a walk?
well, sure.
excuse me.
Bernie! Mom! Hey. Hey!
Hi. - Dr. Yep?
Samantha. Thank you for inviting me.
I'm sorry we're late. - Oh. Yeah. Well, Prudie's not even here yet.
is that Dad?
let's say hi. - Okay.
a doctor.
nothing in haste.
dad! Hi! - Hey.
would you do me a favor?
would you read this?
please. Right now.
isn't that what your special little book club's for?
I really want you to read it.
please, Dean.
it doesn't... They don't...
Prudie, I feel like you want me to be something that I'm not.
I just walk around being me. I don't pretend to be anything else.
I'm the guy who thinks "Austen" is a city in Texas.
I shouldn't have said that. That was mean.
you just set me up for a test that you don't want me to pass.
no, no. This is not a test.
this is something to share.
why don't you just tell me what it's about?
it's about these two people who used to love each other.
and they don't anymore.
and it's how they persuade themselves to give it another try.
look, I can get you started off. Okay?
come on. - So I've been trying to figure out that moment in Persuasion when Wentworth and Anne just began to stop hating each other.
maybe it's when they went with everyone to Lyme.
after Louisa Musgrove fell.
after Wentworth used her to make Anne jealous.
you think he was using Louisa?
Yeah. That's one interpretation.
I think the guy was just trying to feel... - Valued again.
it was a bonehead move.
I mean, he knows he's nothing without Anne.
he loved her then, he loves her now.
I like how Austen always lets the men explain themselves.
Darcy writes a letter to Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, and Frank writes to Emma.
Yeah, in Persuasion, everything hangs on Wentworth leaving her that note - when everybody's talking all around them. - Yeah. Yeah. Sneaky.
no, smart guy. Perfect timing.
Yeah.
let us never underestimate the power of a well-written letter.
Grigg has always loved dogs.
you know, we were never allowed to have one when we were kids.
dogs and books. That's our Grigg.
okay, he'd kill me for saying this, but my brother likes you.
I'm figuring he'll never tell you. And this way it's up to you.
my sisters and me, I wouldn't say we ruined him, but he's just way too considerate to make the first move.
Hey. - Hey.
I was just wishing that Austen had written a bunch more books, you know?
I'm gonna miss this.
"all of the ladies were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight, "excepting Louisa.
she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.
she was safely down and instantly, to show her enjoyment, "ran up the steps to be jumped down again."
he advised her against it, but no...
shoot.
I'm so sorry. I should've called first. I read these books.
I love them.
I couldn't stop reading.
I went to the all-night newsstand on State Street to buy Searoad, the next one, - but they didn't have it, and... - Do you wanna borrow Searoad?
I mean, I have... You know, there...
there are other writers that you might like.
Hey.
Hi, honey.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
wait, wait, wait.
Hey, has anyone read those Patrick O'Brian novels?
british Navy. - Yeah. Jane Austen's navy, 1805.
Yeah. But aren't there, like, 20 of them?
there's more of us now. - I'm in.
Oh, my God, is that Bernadette? - I thought she was in Costa Rica.
buenas noches, everyone. This is Senor Obando.
Hola. - Hello.
hello. - He's working on his English.
I'm working on my Spanish. - Hello.
and so far I have te amo.
and mi esposo.
Oh, my God! - Congratulations!
that's incredible! - That's incredible. Congratulations!
Oh, it's gorgeous. - Thank you.
I'm so happy for you. - Congratulations.
dad, check it out. - Well, let's get you a drink, Mr. Darcy.
don't be gone too long. - Yikes. That makes seven.
what? - Yeah.
Hey, guys. Guys.
he hasn't read a word of Austen.
Oh, poor man.
Ah, yeah. We'll fix that.
Cheers! - Cheers!
a friendship was torn apart.
I care about my friends.
sorry you are no longer a part of that group.
need to talk to you. - What? Here?
Bree's affair was revealed to orson.
Mona threatened angie.
you've got till tomorrow to come up with the rest of the money, or i go to the police.
and then tragedy struck.
I'm at the site of a bizarre accident that happened just hours...
if you watch the news tonight, you will be told all about a tragedy that occurred on a quiet suburban street.
you will hear eyewitness accounts of the crash.
you will learn the extent of the damage.
but the news can't tell you who survived.
because no one yet knows... For sure.
Oh, susan, thank god you're here.
I was on my way home. I got this text from julie.
she said a plane crashed onto the lane? - Yeah.
a single-engine plane that had to make an emergency landing.
the pilot had a heart attack.
Julie said karl was taken away in an ambulance?
Yeah. He's in surgery.
h-how bad is it?
he's gonna make it, right?
there was a lot of bleeding.
the doctors are doing the best they can.
you want to sit down? Here. H-have a seat.
come here.
was anyone else hurt?
Orson... And mona clarke.
Yeah, they're still in surgery.
Bree got a little banged up, but the nurse says she's gonna be okay.
and little celia might have a concussion.
Oh... What--what happened?
the plane was headed straight for her, and lynette ran over and pushed her out of the way.
you saved her life.
come on. You would have done the same thing for my kids. It's no big deal.
no, lynette, we owe you everything.
so what do we do now?
I guess we just wait and pray.
I think that's a really good idea.
Lynette, are you okay?
I don't know. I just... I have this terrible pain.
the truth is, no one knows who who survived that tragic plane crash...
Oh, tom, i think there's something wrong with the babies.
or more importantly, who didn't.
any word about karl?
uh, still in surgery.
God, i feel like such a hypocrite.
after that guy cheated on you, i hahis guts.
never spoke to him again.
and i was just in the chapel praying for him.
I know what you mean.
it's pretty complicated for me, too.
with that, susan began to think of her marriag karl
how wonderfully it had started...
how they'd been so happy...
until the day she found lipstick where she shouldn't have.
Susan then thought of the day she told karl to leave, and she wondered...
what if she hadn't?
wait. Wait! Don't go.
you just kicked me out.
I know.
I put 12 years of my life into this marriage, and we have a daughter.
we owe it to julie to try to work this out.
don't touch me.
you're still a pig.
okay, so, um, if we are gonna put this behind us, i need to know about everyone that you've en with since we were married.
everyone?
I don't think this is a good idea.
Karl, i don't want to be wondering, when we go to a party or a restaurant,"did he sleep with her?
her? Her?
okay. Well, you found out about brandy.
Yes.
it was nice to put the panties with a face.
go on.
well, before her... Let's see... It was amber, the dental hygienist...
Kwan lee, the massage lady...
Oh, remember when we had cable installed, and you wondered why we got so many channels for free?
okay, you know what?
uh, maybe you were right.
it's good to have some srets between a couple.
why don't you just go upstairs and unpack your stuff?
I will learn how to swallow my rage.
you are not gonna regret this.
hey there. I'm mike delfino.
Oh, yes.
we met at, um, mary alice's funeral.
uh, your husband told me you have a clogged sink.
Oh, yeah. Come on in.
so how you liking the neighborhood so far?
I lit. It seems quiet... Friendly.
it is. And safe.
I bet we have the lowest crime rate in america.
you need to get that?
Nah. Let the machine get it.
it's susan and karl.
leave us a message.
Hey, suse. It's me. Listen, i'm gonna be working late.
don't hold dinner for me.
by the way, the switchboard's gonna be closed, so don't bother calling.
love ya.
he's screwing his secretary. - Huh?
my hband.
thinks he's fooling me.
he's not.
I'm sorry.
you know, uh, what would serve him right... To come home and find me in bed with another man.
Yeah, i gotta go. - What's the rush?
well, i've got to get a part at the hardware store.
and they close at 6: 00.
Oh, my god.
am i that undesirable?
no, you're very desirable, uh, i-in--in a big way.
did you just call me fat?
no. No. I-i think you're very beautiful.
it's just... You know, you're married.
right.
um... I'm sorry.
look... If you'runhappy, you should do something about it.
Oh, please. Not another business trip.
Oh, please.
let it be another business trip.
I tried.
I'm sorry.
that's it?
15 years of marriage, and that's all i get-- two lousy sentences?
I don't know what else to say.
I don't know. How about, um,"hey, susan,"thanks for eating nothing but broccoli and colon cleanser "for the last six months so you could lose weight and look good for me"?
Or,"hey, susan, thanks for wasting "the best years of your life while i went out and i banged everything with a g. E.D. And a tramp stamp.
I'm sorry, okay?
but you could've spared yourself all this pain if you'd just let me go the first time.
you really do deserve better, susan.
Mrs. Delfino?
Karl didn't make it.
Oh, my god.
if there's anything you need, we have counselors available.
n-no, i'll--i'll be fine. Thank you.
I can't imagine what you must be feeling.
mostly i'm... I'm feeling grateful.
a b c d e f g
you can get schedud
no deviating from the marriage playbook.
I'm doing it right this time.
happy?
Karl, you've made me happy in ways i couldn't even imagine.
now if it wouldn't be too much trouble, would you mind pulling down my zipper with your teeth and taking me on the table?
nag, nag, nag.
what is it with you women once you get a ring on?
mm, and if you're a stickler for tradition, we could always take it up to our bedroom.
Ourbedroom-- i like the sound of that.
well, get used to it... Mm. Because it's going to be our bedroom for a long, long time.
I meant what i said when i proposed.
being with you is gonna make me into a whole different man.
well, i hope not completely different.
I don't ever want to lose that sexy beast who swept me off my feet.
trust me. He's not going anywhere.
honey, that was fantastic.
Oh, my god.
you're supposed to be catering a wedding.
Yes, clearly this is my fault.
Courtney? - I'm so sorry, bree.
really, karl, yoga instructor?
no charge for next month, okay?
like i'm keeping you!
get the hell out of my house.- She--she's going.
I'm not talking toher!
how could you, karl? In our own bed?
Yeah, you're right. That was tacky.
I am so sorry.
Bye. - I'll call you.
what? - Sorry.
uh, force of habit.
look, this thing doesn't have to mean any more than we decide it does.
you made a vow to me, karl.
Oh, my god. Why did i think i could change you?
Yeah, i know.
you thought you could turn me into your personal lapdog, like orson.
you leave orson out of this.
Why? I haven't done a thg to you that you didn't do to him.
get out of my house!
the truth hurts, doesn't it? - Get out.
I didn't know who else to call.
you were his emergency contact.
I'm just a little surprised.
Orson and i hadn't spoken in nearly ten years.
a-are you sure there wasn't someone else in his life? A girlfriend maybe?
never saw one.
in fact, in the seven years he lived here, i never saw anybody visit him at all.
um... Where did you... Find m?
in the bed.
paramedics said it was a heart attack.
he'd been there two days.
can you imagine?
just like that, you're gone, and no one notices?
poor orson.
well, take whatever you want. I'll have, uh, goodwill pick up the rest.
you know, he spoke about you constantly.
it was always "bree this," "bree that.
it was almost like he died of... - What?
say it.
like he died of a broken heart.
Mrs. Hodge?
I just wanted to tell you your husband's out of danger.
thank god for that.
but there were some complications.
what kind of complications?
this is a preliminary assessment, but it seems there has been some damage to his spinal column.
what does that mean exactly?
there's a good chance your husband is paralyzed.
excuse me.
can you tell me anything about mona clarke's condition?
the doctors--they did everything they could, but that woman... I mean, she was hit by a plane.
Oh, my god!
now all we can do is wait and hope that she pulls through.
pulls through?
Yes. Your friend's a real fighter.
she's hanging in there.
how? She got hit by a plane!
the doctors couldn't believe it either.
I don't know if you're religious, but now would be the time to pray.
Oh, believe me, we will.
dear god, please take that blackmailing bitch home now.
a frickin' plane hit her. What is it gonna take, a silver bullet?
all right, look, i'm gonna go home, pack up our stuff. You stay here.
if they pry the propeller out of that woman's mouth and she starts yapping, get the hell outta here.
just like that, angie bolen began to consider what was happening.
she thought of the doctors trying to save mona and how long it might take her to recover.
then she imagined mona waking up... And telling the police everything she knew.
and angie asked herself, what would happen if mona clarke lived?
how about a little lunch, ms. De luca?
eggplant parm.
maybe it's not like the place we used to see you go into on east 10th street, but not bad.
I want to see nick.
he's a little busy at the moment.
I just want to talk to him for a couple minutes.
as far as the bureau is concerned, nick is a traitor.
get used to it. You're never gonna talk to him again.
what about danny?
Tyleris with your mother.
but enough about what you want.
here's what i want-- patrick logan.
you need to be thinking real clear right now.
we know logan ran everything, but without him, it's all gonna fall on you.
I don't know where he is.
I haven't spoken to him since that night.
you've been on the run 18 years, and you and your former lover don't even exchange a phone call, huh?
don't take this personally, agent padilla, but you guys weren't the ones i was running from.
look, i know logan.
I know how scary he is.
but i think the situation you're in now is worse.
then youdon'tknow how scary he is.
federal sentencing guidelines dictate the punishment in this case.
there's no room for leniency from the court.
that being said, ms. De luca, you have indicated that you would like to address the court.
thank you, your honor.
no one... Was supposed to get hurt.
we just believed in something, and we wanted to make other people believe in it, too.
but someone did get hurt.
a man died.
I read every newspaper article about your husband, about sean
Hohe coached little league, that t whole neighborhood came to his funeral.
I never lived in a world like that...
until we moved to fairview.
I never felt like a part of a community, which...
made it so much clearer to me how horrible it is that i brought so much pain to yours.
please rise for sentencing.
angela de luca, you are hereby sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
marshals, remand the prisoner to custody.
ma? Ma!
so... How is she?
I'm... I'm so sorry.
she didn't make it.
I know how upset you must be.
please don't be angry with god because your prayers weren't answered.
Oh, don't worry about it, hon.
me and god are good.
I spoke with the doctor. They are goingo keep her overnight for observation.
I thought they said she was fine.
no, they're just being extra cautious. That's all.
look at her.
I feel bad even saying it, with everything's that's happened, but... We really lucked out, huh?
I don't think it was luck.
I think it was god.
actually, it was lynette.
no, lynette was his instrument.
either way, it was a hell of a tune.
no, i'm serious.
I think god saved celia because she's special.
she has a gift.
what kind of gift?
I'm not sure yet.
but she has one.
I know she's gonna do something amazing with her life.
fine. While you figure out how our daughter's gonna change the world, i'm going to the cafeteria.
see you in a few.
as she lay there, gabrielle began to think of ways her daughter could shine.
she thought of music...
and sports...
and other creative pastimes.
and before she drifted off to sleep, gabrielle wondered, what if her daughter was destined to be a great actress?
how old are you?
5
it's our first audition. We're very excited.
well, great. Such a cutie, just what we're looking for.
Oh, she can be cuter.
show him, honey.
good girl.
okay, celia, this is a--here.
this is a commercial for ouch away! Bandages.
stand right there on the "t.
you just got a boo-boo on your finger.
you're gonna hold it up, look real sad and cry, okay?
and go.
no, no. Don't smile, honey.
we need you to cry. Let's try it again.
uh, okay.
thank you-- thank you very much.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
you gotta give her another shot. Please.
I... I love the look, but can i be honest with you, mom?
the side dish that came with my lunch has more talent.
what are you saying?
I'm saying she's not as good as coleslaw. Deal with it.
Hey, that little girl is here for a reason.
she is going to inspire people, and you are gonna be part of that!
all right. Well, hurry up.
all right. Hey, i got you another chance.
can you cry for mommy?
sure you can.
when that nice casting man asks you to hold up a finger, just hold it up and cry.
how easy is that?
Hello?
what?
Oh, my god.
daddy fell and hurt himself.
I don't think he's gonna make it.
and... When he fell, he landed on your hamster cage and crushed mr. Mcfuzz.
he iad. Mr. Mcfuzz is dead.
okay.
roll it.
Gaby, i'm going to take celia for an ice cream!
be back in a bit!
come on.
the bus for camp leaves in 20 minutes.
but what about my auditions?
mommy's gonna kill us.
Hey, let me handle mommy.
you need a sleeping bag to get ice cream?
run!
leave it. Leave it! Leave it!
what the hell are you doing? We talked about this.
no summer camp. She's got auditions.
Gaby, you have got her living in this weird little bubble, and she needs to be around kids her own age.
she will be. I'm taking her to a casting call for "annie.
why can't you support her career?
Celia, will you wait in the car, plse?
thank you, sweetie.
because she stinks.
that little girl is destined for greatness. That is why god saved her.
God does not save people who stink.
Yeah, well, maybe god saved her so that she could go to camp and make some friends and have a normal childhood!
who would believe in a god like that?
Gaby, she's misee.
no, she's not. She wants this.
no, she does it to please you!
that is a horrible thing to say. I am not hurting her.
in fact, making her shine is my life's work.
all i want is for people to understand how special she is.
Celia, get in the house! - Celia, wait.
I'm sorry, but you have clearly lost your mind, and i'm not gonna stand here and watch you ruin our daughter's childhood.
if you don't like it, leave.
Gaby, be careful what you say, because i am very close to going.
see ya. Come on.
let's go get ready for your audition.
you're gonna be the best annie ever.
there you go, sweetie.
all better.
Ouch away! Adhesive bandages... They heal with a mother's love.
ma, no.
look at that face.
that's a star.
you're not watching this again.
now please, help me with the groceries.
did you get my wrinkle cream?
you can't buy stuff like that with food stamps.
I know. I just wish you loved me enough to steal it.
Hello?
Jerry, sweetie.
honey, it's your agent.
Oh, celia's dying to work.
what do you got for us?
Oh, come on. There's gotta be something.
no, no. She's not too old.
she can pass for 15.
hell, i'm looking at her right now.
okay, we'll be there.
baby, we've got an audition.
and we gotta get that hair into pigtails.
ma, i think we need to talk.
what did i dowith those ace bandages?
we gotta flatten you down.
listen to me.
I don't want to be an actress.
what? You can't quit. You're...
I'm special. This is my destiny.
it's why i was spared.
you spent the last 20 years telling me i'm meant for big things.
and you are.
no.
I'm not special. I'm normal.
and i just want to have a normal life-- get married, have kids.
and there's gonna be plenty of time for that.
you always say that.
why can't you admit it's over?
because if we give up, then everything i've worked for is for nothing.
your father walked out. Your sister never calls.
this is all i have.
what time's the audition?
tomorrow, 3:00.
now let's do something about this hair.
Oh, honey, this is the one. I feel it.
one day you're gonna thank me.
I brought you coffee.
so have you figured out what our 4-year-old is gonna do with her life?
no.
but i did figure out what she has to do to be special.
what's that?
absolutely nothing.
how could this happen? I know i fell, but i felt fine afterwards.
it doesn't take much to cause a tear to the placenta.
but you said the one baby is fine?
Yes, but if we don't operate on the other one, there could be a decrease in blood flow to the brain, which could put the child at risk developmentally.
at risk how? Physically? Mentally?
right now there's no way to know.
how soon can we do the surgery?
we're ready to go.
let's get her in.
at that moment, lynette began to think of the baby she had yet to meet.
she thought of what it would be like to hold him, how it would feel to look into his eyes...
and to kiss his tiny hand.
and then lynette thought ofhat would happen if the doctor told her that same beautiful child was disabled.
he especially hates the hamstring stretches.
well, and obviously it's hard to hear him cry, but you really need to tune it out, because without the therapy, his muscle tone will...
you try. Maybe it's me.
sometimes it helps to sing to them.
Oh, i do that. He loves it when i do that.
and the sailor said,"brandy, you're a fine girl
what a good wife you would be
why don't we take a break?
maybe we should take some time and talk about where we're at.
where we're at is we haven't seen any milestones since august.
not since he finally started grabbing his feet.
but that was a big one. - Definitely.
but he should be sitting by now, right?
or pulling to stand or crawling.
if you worry too much about whathe suld be able to do by now or what other kids his age are doing, it's gonna drive you crazy.
fine.
I know i keep saying this, but try to focus on the progress he's making.
like what?
you're with him every day.
you tell me.
what do you see?
would you, um, excuse us for a second? - It's okay.
what is it?
I can't do this. - Can't do what?
this, her, the therapy, and the injections and the equipment.
and no one can even tell us if any of it is helping.
I think it is.
but even if it isn't, this is what there is to do, so we're doing it.
well, i can't.
no, you don't want to.
neither do i.
neither does he. Didn't you hear him crying in there?
but we don't have a choice. So come on.
Jean's gotta go home soon.
I feel like i'm being punished, and i don't even know what i did.
you can't think that way.
what else is there to think about?
hopes for the future?
he might not even have one.
he's 14 months. Don't write him off yet!
but you should start thinking about the future, because no matter what, it's coming.
and it's either gonna make you less afraid or more, and you willnow that you either did everything that you can for your son...
or you will be sorry.
Yeah. There we go.
I know.
come here.
it's okay.
I can do this.
Hi, honey.
can i have a sandwich?
uh, sure.
I just have to finish these dishes.
but i'm hungry.
well, unless you want soap on rye, you're gonna have to wait.
actually, why don't you make yourself a sandwich?
but youalwaysdo it.
and you always watch me, so i know you know how.
I'm tired.
so am i, and i still have to vacuum and do the laundry.
my arms hurt.
I had to swim today.
and you do that so you can get stronger, so you can do things like make sandwiches.
speaking of which, in the time we've been arguing about this, you could've--guess what-- made a sandwich.
so could you!
Jason's mom makes him whatever food he wants, even french toast.
I would happy to make jason french toast, too.
he always tells me how pretty i am.
not to mention, he's also in a wheelchair, so he can't reach the shelves in the fridge.
but you can!
too bad you don't appreciate it.
you're not-- you're not really busy!
you just don't want to help me!
you know what? One day i won't be able to help you because i won't be here, and then maybe you'll understand why i wanted you to learn to do stuff for yourself!
or you won't!
but either way, i'm not making you a sandwich.
that looks good.
can i have a bite?
when i was bn, my doctor told my parents i wouldn't make it through the night, then through the week, then it was that i was blind, that i'd need a wheelchair.
I guess what i'm saying is... I've really pissed my doctors off.
at first, my mother was scared
scared of my disability, my limitations.
I know this because she told me.
then she realized what she was really scared of, was my potential and that she's miss something that would help me reach it.
gandhi said,"strength... "does not come from a physical capacity.
it comes from an indomitable will.
my mother's probably never heard that saying...
but every day of my life, she showed me how true it is.
now i... I hope i can start showing her.
thank you.
thank you all very much.
how's our baby?
is he okay?
we lost the baby.
but... The other baby is fine.
it's okay.
we're gonna be okay.
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q
what are you talking about?
Oh yeah? Every time I go to see him, she tells me that he's just settled down.
can you blame her? You dropped him.
I did not drop him, he jumped.
jumped? - Well, he wiggled out of my arms.
I said I was sorry. Besides, how much damage could I possibly have done?
he fell, like, maybe two feet.
stuff like that happens all the time.
I mean, I was dropped like, a dozen times when I was a kid.
well, that explains a lot.
why do you even care? You don't even like kids. - It's the principle of the thing.
everybody else gets to hold him. Why shouldn't I?
Colonel...
we've got a new contact. Looks like a ship.
how far out?
it's in orbit.
well, how come we didn't detect it?
I don't know. We didn't even detect a hyperspace window.
it just appeared out of nowhere.
hang on a second, we're getting I. F.F.
it's the Daedalus.
the Daedalus? How can that be? They're on their way back to earth.
well, they were. They were supposed to be.
open up a channel.
Daedalus, this is Atlantis, please come in.
Daedalus, please respond.
they're not going to answer.
why not?
because I'm not reading any lifesigns.
what are you telling me, Rodney, this thing flew here by itself?
I don't know how they got here, but there's no one on board.
Colonel, we just got confirmation from stargate command.
the Daedalus is in the Milky Way, on course and on schedule.
the Daedalus Variations
they expect to reach earth within two days.
understood.
so that's not the Daedalus, then.
not unless it can be in two places at once.
perhaps the Apollo, or one of your other ships... - They wouldn't be sending daedalus I. F.F..
plus it doesn't explain how they got here, or why we're not picking up lifesign readings.
all right, I'm taking us in for a closer look.
wow, you see that?
Yeah, some scorch marks.
you think weapon's fire?
well, wherever she's been, she's been through some pretty hard times.
what's that?
I'm picking up an energy reading.
it's coming from the ship.
is it dangerous?
I don't think so, but I have no idea what's causing it.
can you get the bay doors open?
if the ship's command systems are as familiar as the rest of it, it shouldn't be a problem.
no F-302s, but there's a jumper.
you sure there's no one else inside?
as far as I can tell.
all right, we're going in.
why is it so cold in here?
the ship's operating on emergency power.
some of the systems are barely registering.
except for the whole weird energy thing.
that's right.
can you do something about it? It's freezing in here.
Oh, sure, I just have to get to engineering.
you and Ronon are together. Teyla, you and I are going to check out the bridge.
radio me if you find anything.
no bodies in here.
Colonel...
it's the Daedalus , all right.
McKay, is that you?
of course it was me. Who else would it be?
you think we've got a ghost on board or something?
will you please not touch anything!
what's our status?
I've restored basic power to most of the ship.
it should be warming up any second now.
good.
check on that energy reading. Try to figure out what it is, all right?
I'm on it.
Colonel...
ship's log, last entry.
preparations are almost complete.
we've beamed down the last of our supplies, and any equipment we think might be useful.
I'll be taking the last of the F-302s down myself.
of course, we haven't had time to do a proper survey of the planet's surface, but it seems habitable enough.
plenty of fresh water, arable soil, not that different from our own.
I realize our chance of rescue is slim, but it's become obvious that we no longer have a choice.
this is colonel Sobol, commander of the Daedalus , signing off.
do you recognize her?
I've never seen her before in my life.
well, it appears as if they abandoned ship.
Yeah. The question is, why?
I'll check previous entries.
man, this ship has been through the wringer.
no, hyperdrive, subspace communications are all damaged beyond repair, the shields are virtually depleted...
what is it?
it's the energy reading.
it's spiking.
Sheppard, come in.
go ahead.
something's happening. The energy reading, it's going off the charts.
do something. Turn it off.
I don't know how. Look, it's not coming from any of the main systems.
Colonel sheppard, this is Atlantis. We're picking up some kind of power surge coming from the ship.
Yeah, we noticed it. We're trying to check it out ourselves.
the levels are still rising.
Colonel, should we send another jumper to assist?
stand by.
all right, that's our cue to leave.
everyone, back in the jumper.
McKay, what the hell was that?
I have no idea, but the energy reading's gone back down the way it was.
Atlantis, you reading anything unusual?
Atlantis, come in.
Atlantis, do you read?
Colonel sheppard, do you read?
Daedalus , this is Atlantis, please respond.
what the hell's going on?
I don't know. One moment they were there, the next minute, they were gone.
I'm having problems with communications. I can't reach Atlantis.
wait a second.
that can't be right.
what?
I'm not seeing the city on any of my screens.
what are you talking about?
I just did a sensor sweep, and there's nothing down there but ocean.
well, maybe they cloaked.
well, they wouldn't have done that without telling us.
well, I don't know, maybe there's a wraith ship in the area.
I'm not reading anything.
are we certain it's the same planet?
perhaps the energy burst shifted our position.
no, according to our instruments, we haven't moved at all.
what do you want me to believe, Rodney?
that Atlantis just disappeared?
look, I don't know. Just give me a second, I'll figure it out, all right?
in the meantime, I've managed to localize the source of the energy reading.
it's coming from a hold on deck 9.
all right, keep trying to reach Atlantis. We'll check it out.
Sheppard, I think I've got something.
it's the residual radiation from the flash.
it's similar to what happens when you open a hyperspace window, but different enough that the sensors wouldn't have picked it up automatically.
what the hell does that mean?
I think we're looking at a new kind of drive.
I thought you said we didn't go anywhere.
we didn'T. At least not according to the ship's navigational systems.
so, a malfunctioning drive?
maybe. Just hang on.
Oh, my god, Sheppard. - Stand by, Rodney.
no, you don't understand, I know what it is.
look, the residual radiation.
it's exactly what we recorded when my double arrived on Atlantis from an alternate reality.
I can't believe I didn't see this before.
Sheppard, hey.
it's a drive all right, but it didn't move us through space.
I think it's moved us into a parallel universe.
that would explain a lot of things.
how long have they been dead for?
this place was like a meat locker.
they could've been preserved like this for months.
they look just like us.
that's because they are us, the alternate reality versions of us.
I feel like someone just walked over my grave.
take it easy. Everything's fine.
Oh, no, no, no, this is very bad.
this tablet belonged to the other Mckay.
they weren't part of the original crew. They came here just like us.
look, a ship appeared in orbit above their Atlantis, they came to check it out.
that would explain the other jumper in the bay.
the ship jumped to another reality, and they were stuck, they couldn't get back.
look, eventually their supplies ran out, and they...
all right, all right, mystery solved. Let's move on.
don't you realize what this means?
they were us, and they failed.
well, they're not us. We're still alive. Let's go.
the answer's in here somewhere.
can you power up the systems?
Yeah, just hold on.
all right, that's a start.
what's behind here?
that's a good question.
I'm guessing that's our alternate reality drive.
can you figure out how to control it?
offhand, I'd say no.
that's what the other Mckay was trying to do, and he had weeks.
fine.
I'll start with his research.
it'll at least give us a head start.
that's better. We're going to go look or supplies.
you don't think the other us wouldn't have already tried that? - Get to work.
did you find anything?
not unless you know a way to cook this.
perhaps we should consider going down to the planet to collect supplies.
Sheppard says it's too risky.
the drive could kick in, and the ship could take off without us.
then we'd be stuck here.
the others that we found...
do you think their lives were very similar to ours?
who cares?
how can you say that?
we've seen our doubles before.
Replicator-manufactured copies.
I can't help but wondering who might still be waiting for her back on her Atlantis.
do you mean, did she also have a son?
the thought had crossed my mind.
look...
I've heard Mckay talk about this stuff before, and supposedly,
which also means there's a million different Torrens.
you going to worry about every one of them?
no.
it's difficult enough worrying about one.
I'll bet it is.
come on.
why is the blast door closed?
Oh, right.
have you made any progress?
we?
me and the other Mckay, who, unsurprisingly, is a genius.
not only that, but it looks like the drive was created by yet another Mckay from the original reality.
what makes you say that?
well, there's a certain, um, elegance to the design that I recognize.
I'm sure that's what the crew was saying when they abandoned ship.
well, admittedly there are problems, but it is still a monumental achievement.
all right.
so, what do we do?
can we just throw this thing in reverse?
uh, yeah, it's a little more complicated than that.
the first problem is navigation.
they've developed a coordinate system to identify the various realities and allow them to get back, but obviously that didn't work.
obviously.
that's not what bothers me.
it's power generation, and jumping from one reality to another requires massive amounts of power.
we're talking ZPM levels here.
obviously they didn't have one of those rattling around, so they created a capacitor that's constantly drawing power from subspace.
and it looks like it's almost charged.
is this your long-winded way of telling me you just can't turn it off?
think of it like a tap, pouring water into a bucket.
when the bucket is full, the drive engages, except this particular tap has no valve.
that seems like a pretty serious design flaw, don't you think?
exactly.
which leads me to believe they were tampering with it, in a vain attempt to generate more power.
as they got further and further from their own reality,
I guess they figured they'd need it to get back.
and here we go.
okay.
where are we?
Oh, don't look at me.
I haven't had time to route the main systems to these control panels.
I'm flying blind down here.
Ronon, Teyla, meet me at the bridge.
on our way.
keep it up, Rodney.
Colonel, Atlantis is back.
I'm picking them up on the sensors.
you know how to work this stuff?
I was busy.
Atlantis, this is sheppard, come in.
Atlantis, do you read?
Atlantis, this is sheppard, come in.
maybe they already have a Sheppard.
what are the odds of us randomly jumping back into our own reality?
I'd say slim to none.
I'm detecting another ship in orbit.
what kind?
I'll see if I can pull it up on screen.
I don't recognize it.
what's that?
you know it?
no.
Colonel, I believe the ship is powering weapons.
what's our shield status?
minimal.
it's firing on Atlantis.
the city's shields are failing.
Rodney, do we have enough juice to power up the Asgard beam?
maybe. You might be able to get a couple of shots off.
Why?
there's some alien ship attacking Atlantis.
so?
what do you mean, "so?" It's Atlantis!
it's not our Atlantis.
we have no idea who's down there. Look, we should just stay out of it.
if we do not intervene, the city will be destroyed.
Yeah, we need help.
my gut tells me we're better off going with the people on that planet than whoever's on that ship.
I hope you're right.
Yeah, well, me too.
the ship's been damaged. It's stopped firing.
hopefully we took out its main weapons.
wait, something's happening.
they're launching fighters.
you should've took marks up when you had the chance. Now you'll have to learn fast.
Rail-gun targeting systems.
button's on the right. Control, radar, tracking, and target acquisition, use the red button to fire.
what the hell was that?
we're under attack. Any chance of getting that hyperdrive back online?
great.
there's too many of them. I can't do this. - Keep trying!
we've lost sublight.
we have a hull breach.
we're venting atmosphere. I don't know what to do.
seal off damaged areas. We should be okay for the moment.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Sheppard, I have an idea!
let's hear it.
I've set up a few protocols that should increase the efficiency of the alternate reality drive.
drive if I enable them, we might be able jump sooner.
what, jump to the next universe?
Exactly!
but if I do this, I can't undo it!
I mean, we'll just start jumping faster and faster!
do it.
it worked.
where are we?
we have a problem.
temperature in the hull is rising rapidly.
what the hell is this?
according to these readings, we're less than two million kilometers from the surface of the sun.
I thought we always jumped to the same place in every reality.
as did I.
hull temperature is approaching critical.
if we do not restore shields, we're going to burn.
are you sure about this?
well, we're not imagining it, Rodney.
let me transfer the sensors down to the station. Then at least I can...
Ooh...
well, you're definitely not imagining that.
thanks for the vote of confidence.
I don't understand it. We always jump to the same relative position in space.
unless...
unless what?
you said when you went to the future, you saw our sun expanding into a red giant, remember?
what are you saying, we're jumping through time now?
no, no, no, no, no, but maybe what eventually happens in our reality is happening in this one, only much sooner.
we didn't go to the sun. The sun came to us.
so how does this help us?
I-I don't know.
I just, I found it interesting.
what's interesting, Rodney, is a way out of this without getting fried, like getting sublight back on, so we can get the hell out of here.
actually, I think our best bet is just to transfer as much power as we can to the shields, and ride it out till the next jump.
when does that happen?
well, the time the capacitor takes to charge is different now that I've enacted those new protocols.
you know, um...
I have no idea.
you're not exactly selling the plan, Rodney.
I have no idea how long it would take me to fix the sublights either!
look, I've got to run a diagnostic, but theoretically, transferring power to the shields should be relatively easy.
all right, what do we do?
the first I need you to do is head down to engineering.
let's go.
all right, we're here. What do we do?
you need to kill all power to non-essential decks.
which means you're going to have to access the main administrative interface.
that should bring up a list of all available override commands.
got it.
okay.
so choose the command for life support.
you'll have to designate the decks one by one.
I think that's all of them.
dammit.
that didn't buy us nearly as much power as I would have thought.
well, there's got to be something else.
right, um...
all right, look, the ship has auxiliary power modules for most of the main systems.
most likely they're depleted, but if not, well, it might buy us a little more juice.
well, there you go.
what the hell was that? Was it gunfire?
Where's Ronon?
keep working.
stay focused, Rodney.
tell me what to do next. - All right.
you okay?
Yeah.
where the hell did he come from?
check it out.
it's the symbol that was on the alien ship.
how'd he get on board?
you know, they crashed into us, penetrated our hull, remember?
think he did it on purpose?
that's a good question.
Hey.
let me try that.
that's it. That's all of them.
I must go help Colonel Sheppard and Ronon. Good luck, Rodney.
no, no, no, no, no, it's not enough!
what do you mean?
without sublights, our orbit is decaying, which means more radiation slamming into the shields.
the alternate reality drive is only charged to 70% percent.
which means it'll never make 100 before the shields fail.
well, what do we do? We have no more power.
J-Just... give me a second.
Rodney, Colonel Sheppard and Ronon are under attack.
all right, I got it, I got it. Drop the shields.
what?
drop the shields, I will transfer all available power to the drive.
hopefully it'll be enough to induce a jump.
hopefully?
it is our only option, and every second we argue about it, is less of a chance it's going to work!
very well. Dropping shields.
hull temperature is passing critical.
okay, transferring power to the drive now.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
what is it? - It's not enough. It's only 98%!
Rodney, the hull is beginning to deteriorate.
come on, come on!
that's it! Sheppard, we're jumping!
nice work, Rodney.
uh, you may want to hold off on the congratulations.
now what?
I think I've overtaxed the drive.
look, it's not completely blown, but we've only a handful of jumps before it's burned out.
all right, then what happens?
what happened to the planet?
Rodney believes that in this reality, it was destroyed by an impact, possibly millions of years ago.
all that remains is this asteroid field.
all right, I think I got something.
I was just too busy trying to avoid imminent death to notice it.
what are you talking about? - See, my mistake was focusing on the navigation system.
I should've known that was never going to work.
so, what, then?
so in spectacular feat of multi-dimensional mathematics, I've discovered a way to send the ship back along the path it's previously traveled bypassing the navigation system altogether.
wait a minute.
you're talking about putting this thing in reverse?
exactly.
I just suggested that two hours ago.
and naturally, I dismissed it out of hand, but then I realized that, including the original designer, not one, but two versions of myself have failed to make this thing work.
I had to think not like me.
I had to think the opposite of me. Doesn't get more opposite than you.
I'll take that as a compliment.
so can we get back or not?
well, not directly.
it's impossible to calculate the relative position of our original starting point from where we are now, but we can retrace our steps, passing through each reality in turn until we reach the right one.
slight problem, Rodney.
we barely got out of those realities alive.
if we do no restore the shields, the radiation from the red giant will kill us.
not necessarily.
we let the ship carry us in its momentum in real space from one reality to the next.
now, we may not have sublight engines, but we do have maneuvering thrusters.
you know, one long continuous burn along the right trajectory, from now until the next jump should be enough to allow us to establish a higher, more stable orbit around the sun.
so the radiation will not affect us?
well, I wouldn't go that far, but still, it'll be... not quite as deadly?
okay. That's it.
course is already plotted.
what about those alien dudes? They're know we're the ones that shot at them.
maybe they'll be gone.
I wouldn't count on it.
time is passing at the same rate in each of the realities, which means...it hasn't been that long.
to get past those aliens, we're going to need sublight engines, and I'm going to need to fix them in time.
wait, wait, but you said you don't know what's wrong with those.
I haven't had a chance to check it out.
I can't do 10 things at once.
I already told you, the drive is going to burn out, soon.
we have to do something.
who's to say the next reality won't be even worse?
all right, all the modifications to the drive are in place.
here we go.
it worked. You did it, Rodney.
all right, I'm going to head up to engineering, get to work on the sublights.
what's our status?
hull temperature is rising, but not as rapidly as it did before. I think we'll be okay.
so much for the frying pan.
let's hope we make it through the fire.
how is it coming?
hmm? Ah, it's not good.
the main systems are completely fried. I'll have to do a full bypass.
Oh, jeez!
what the...
Thanks.
perhaps a separate diagnostic of the auxiliary system might be useful.
uh, sure.
for what?
for not giving up.
Oh, I know what this is.
it's your first mission back.
I am not about to let it be your last, okay?
Oh, no, that's what I was afraid of.
what is it?
the drive's charging a lot faster now.
looks like the next jump's going to happen a lot sooner than we thought.
how's it coming with the sublight engine?
I'm going to need a few minutes.
do we have a few more minutes?
all right, let's split rail gun positions. I'll take forward, you take after.
you really think that'll make a difference?
without shields, probably not, but we don't have much of a choice.
Where's the alien ship?
I'm not sure.
well, maybe they left.
no such luck. They're right behind us.
fighters, closing in on our position. How's it going down there?
look, just give me a second!
okay, try it now.
that's it, I've got it!
go, go, go, go, go, go!
how we doing?
they're gaining on us.
can you get us more speed?
there's not a chance! Look, I've barely got this thing working as it is!
if we tax it any more, we're going to blow the whole system!
then we've got a real problem.
they're in weapons range.
return fire. - I'm trying.
easy, chewie, those buttons are your friends.
just keep Trying - I'm trying!
that's it, sublights are gone for good this time!
what the hell was that?
F-302s.
it's Atlantis.
what's happening?
looks like we're getting some help from some friends.
guess we bet on the right side after all.
Daedalus , this is lt. Colonel John·Sheppard.
do you read?
Daedalus, do you read?
uh...
Yeah, Daedalus. Uh, this is Daedalus. Come in.
who... who is this?
it's a long story.
well, whoever you are, you saved our asses when you took out their main weapons.
I think at least we could do is to return the favor.
much appreciated.
uh, Sheppard...
Oh, crap.
sorry about that. One of 'em got through.
nice shooting, though.
Oh, thanks.
all right, looks like that's the last of them.
so, uh...
so, what happens now?
well, we go our own ways.
just like that?
well, the thing is, uh, we do have a few questions.
see, the Daedalus we know was destroyed two years ago in a battle with the replicators.
sorry to hear that, but this isn't exactly our Daedalus. We're just borrowing it for a while.
okay, I have no idea what that means.
like I said, it's a long story.
all right, Daedalus , good luck.
thank you, colonel, and one last thing, it's been a pleasure.
you're obviously a man of great integrity, and a dedicated commander, and a very skilled pilot.
well, that's funny. I was going to say the same to you.
all right.
the alien ship's gone. I'm reading a planet with no energy signatures.
it's the first reality we jumped to. One more, and we're home.
let's get down to the hangar bay.
I got shot!
I thought we got 'em all.
apparently not.
think there's any more of them?
we're not waiting around to find out.
move, move, move!
the explosion's caused a hull breech.
whole sections have been de-pressurized, including the hangar bay!
we just lost the jumpers!
our stop is coming up, Rodney. It's time to get off this train.
look, there's no way off.
once we jump into our own reality, Atlantis will detect us, and they will send help.
we broke orbit to get away from the fighters, remember?
look, we carry our momentum and relative position in space from one reality to the next.
which means, by the time we next jump, we're going to be, like, half a million kilometers out.
they're never going to get to us in time!
we got C-4. We wait till we get back, then we blow the drive.
that could work, or it could tear a hole in the space-time continuum not only killing us but destroying the entire solar system!
well, we'd better think of something fast.
another contact just appeared on our screens.
was it the Daedalus?
no, they're too far out for us to get I. F.F.
well, try subspace.
Colonel Sheppard, do you read?
Colonel Sheppard, this is Major Lorne, do you read?
was there a hyperspace window?
no, sir. They just appeared out of nowhere.
well, it's got to be them.
alert Mr. Woolsey. Doc, you're with me. Let's go, come on.
all right, we should be within radio range.
Colonel Sheppard, come in.
Dr. Mckay, this is Major Lorne. Do you read?
there's too much interference.
I'm picking up some kind of energy reading.
it's spiking.
what the hell just happened?
they disappeared.
what are you talking about?
well... they're just gone.
Oh, wait a minute.
I'm picking up four lifesigns.
okay, where?
dead ahead.
Colonel sheppard, is that you?
major... nice of you to stop by.
kind of hard to get a cab in this neighborhood.
Yes, sir.
how many jumps you think that drive has left in it before it burns out?
half a dozen, tops. Then it'll be completely inert.
good. I'd hate to think of somebody else getting trapped inside that thing like we did.
actually, you know, I've been thinking about that.
now, true, the navigation system was flawed to start, but the basic principles of the drive are fundamentally sound
forget it, Rodney. - I've saved the relevant data.
minor adjustments, and I should be able to have this thing up and running
I said forget it.
Hey, look who's here.
how's your shoulder, Rodney?
uh, it's pretty bad, but, you know, better, thanks.
is it well enough to hold him?
Really?
don't drop him.
thank you.
hey there, little guy.
I think he likes me.
it suits you.
you think so?
I think you'll make an excellent father someday.
I've seen a lot of scary things in my time, but that thought scares me the most.
do you want to, um...
I think so.
there you go, watch out...
right.
so I'm going to cover this.
so we're ready to start.
so, so far we've considered is, the case of certainty.
so with uncertainty things get much more interesting and I want to remind you of a few of the basics of mathematical statistics that I'm sure you know.
so you know we deal with random variables which have uncertain outcomes but with well-defined probabilities.
so another step that we're not going to take in this course is to say people just have no idea what the chances are something's going to happen.
shiller thinks we live in a world like that where who knows what the future's going to be like and people they hear a story and then everybody gets wildly optimistic and then they hear some terrible story and then everybody gets wildly pessimistic and that kind of mood swing can affect the whole economy.
I'm not going to deal with that.
it's hard to quantify and I'm not exactly sure it's as important as he thinks it is.
so we're going to deal with the case where many things can happen but you know what the chances are that they could happen and still lots of things can go wrong in that case.
so there are a couple of words that I want you to know which we went over last time, and I'll just do an example.
we always deal with states of the world, states of nature.
that was Leibniz's idea.
so let's take the simplest case where with probability 1 half you could get 1, and with probability 1 half you could get minus 1.
so that's a random variable.
it might be how your investment does.
half the time you're going to make a dollar.
half the time, you're going lose a dollar.
so this is X, so we define the expectation of X which I write as X bar as the probability of the up state happening so let's just call that 1 half times 1 + 1 half times minus 1 which equals 0.
then I define the variance of X to be, what's the expectation of the squared difference from the expectation?
so how uncertain it is.
you're sort of on average expecting to get 0
so uncertain it is, is measured how far from 0 you are but we're going to square it.
so it's 1 half times squared 1 half times squared = 1 half times 1 1 half times 1 which also equals 1.
so the variance is 1.
and then I'll write the standard deviation of X equals the square root of the variance of X, which equals the square root of 1 which is also 1.
so very often we're going to use the expectation of X that's going to be how good the thing is and the standard deviation is going to be how uncertain it is and people aren't going to like--soon we're going to introduce the idea that people don't like uncertainty and this is the measure of what they do like.
it pays off on average a big number, say, this one doesn't but it could, and the measure of uncertainty is the standard deviation.
I choose that rather than the variance for a reason you'll see.
it makes all the graphs prettier, but also if you double X you'll double the expectation, obviously, because you just double everything inside here.
the variance, though, you're going to end up squaring the two.
if you double X you'll double all these outcomes and the mean so you'll end up multiplying the variance by 4
whereas you'll multiply the standard deviation by 2.
so re-scaling just re-scales these two numbers and has a funny effect on that number.
so that's the reason why we use these two.
now, you could take another example, by the way which is . 9 times 3
let's call this Y, and . 1 times minus something.
how about let's call this 1 third and this minus 3.
now, what's the expectation of Y?
the expectation of Y equals . 3, right equals--just write it out, it's . 9 times 1 third+. 1 times minus 3 which equals . 3-. 3 which equals 0
so the expectation of this random variable is the same as the expectation of that random variable.
and now the variance of this, of Y is . 9 times squared . 1 times squared which equals . 9 times 1 ninth right,+. 1 times 9 which equals . 1+ . 9
which equals 1, which is the same as the other one.
so here we've got another random variable which looks quite different from this, so clearly standard deviation and expectation don't characterize things.
this looks quite different from that one, has the same standard deviation and the same expectation.
so we're going to come back what the difference is between these two variables in a second.
so there's another thing I want to introduce which is the covariance of X and Y.
so we could look at the outcomes of these variables.
where am I going to write this?
I'll write it over here.
we could look at the outcome of these variables in a picture like this, and so here we have X and here we have Y.
so X could turn out to be 1 when Y is 1 third and X could turn out to be 1 when Y is minus 3.
so here's an outcome, and here's an outcome and X could be minus 1, and we could get 1 third or minus 3.
so there are four outcomes looked at here.
so if you looked at X alone it's got a 50/50 chance you're here or here.
if you look at Y alone it's a 90 percent chance up there and a 10 percent chance down there.
so those are called the marginal distributions but the joint distribution we would have to add a number.
so if you looked at X alone, by the way you would say X alone you would say here's 0
here's 1, here's minus 1, so you could have this or this with probability 1 half and 1 half and Y you could have
so we'll draw it this way.
with Y you could have 1 third or minus 3 and here the probability is going to be . 9 and . 1.
this is 0. Those are the pictures that we started with.
so you know where X could end up and where Y could end up well, you don't know where they jointly could end up.
so if they end up on the long diagonal that means when X is high
y tends to be high and vice versa, and if you end up down here X is low and Y is low.
so to the extent that the probability is on the long diagonal they're correlated together.
to the extent that the probability is on the off diagonal they're negatively correlated.
so anyway, to get a sense of that the covariance is going to be the probability of times times the probability of--I'll just go around the circle of times times the probability of sorry what did I just do?
I did minus 1 and 1 third.
I've already done that, so I'm down here.
so times times (minus 3
y bar probability of the ordered pair
student: Should that minus be the X bar or Y bar?
Prof: Thank you.
and probability, what's the point I haven't done yet times times .
so why does that covariance pick up the idea of correlation?
well, to the extent that the probabilities are high here and over there on the long diagonal this term is going to get a lot of weight and what is the other term , and this term is going to get a lot of weight.
so to the extent that you're on the long diagonal this term and this term are going to get a lot of weight but you see those terms this is going to be positive because it's 1 - 0 and 1 third - 0, so that's a positive term.
and this is negative, minus 1 - 0
minus 3 - 0, so a negative times a negative is also positive.
to the extent that you're down here and up there you're going to get big positive numbers in the covariance.
to the extent you're on the off diagonal you'll get big probabilities here, but they all multiply negative terms.
this is a minus and this is a minus, because one of terms is above the mean and the other one is below the mean.
that's what it means to be in the off diagonal.
so covariance is giving you a sense of whether things are moving together or moving the opposite way.
so those are the basic things you have to know.
and I guess another couple things are the covariance is linear in X, right because if you double X every time you see the X variable over here it's always an X outcome minus an X bar an X outcome minus an X bar, an X outcome minus an X bar an X outcome minus an X bar, so if you double X you're going to double every term.
so it's linear in X and in Y, and so one last thing to keep in mind is that the variance of X is just the covariance of X with itself.
obviously if you just plug in X equal to Y you just get the formula for variance and similarly because they're linear the covariance of X+Y so the variance of X+Y, one more formula of X+Y by linearity--first of all that's the covariance of X+Y with itself, and therefore by linearity now
I'm just going to do linear stuff that's equal to the covariance of X with X the covariance of Y with Y +2 times the covariance of X with Y.
since it's linear I just do the linear parts, right?
covariance of X+Y with X+Y is covariance of X+Y with X covariance of X+Y with Y, then I repeat the linearity thing and I get down to that.
so those are basically the key formulas to know.
so now I'm going to make three little observations that come out of all of this that are quite fascinating so quite elementary.
are there any questions about this, these numbers?
yes?
Prof: Why did we give? Say that again.
student: Why did you underline the probably of negative 1, negative 3.
Prof: Probably of negative 1, negative 3.
that's this outcome here.
we underlined it not because it was very likely but because this term is going to be positive.
this is positive and this is positive.
so the whole point is the joint distribution is not specified not determined by the distributions of X alone and Y alone.
so even if I know the probability of what X could do and I know what the probabilities that Y could do that doesn't tell me anything about what numbers I should put on these four outcomes.
for example, I could have at one extreme when X is high Y is high--it can't be exactly that because the probabilities are different.
these numbers and those numbers don't determine these four numbers.
so there are many different numbers I could put in these four squares which would give me in total this probability outcome for X and in total this probability outcome for Y.
so an easy way to see that is if I made them.
so what are the observations I want to make?
for instance, I could say if X turns out to be 1 half then I'll always assume Y turns out to be 1 half and then with the other 40 percent of the time Y might turn out to be--when Y's high X might have to turn out--so here are some ways I could do this.
I could put 50 percent here, . 5 here right?
then 40 percent of the time this is going to turn out--so I have a . 5 here, then what could I do with the rest of this?
this plus this has to add up to 50 percent.
so 50 percent I could have X turn out to be here.
so when X is 1 I could have Y always turn out to be 1
so that means I must have a probability here a probability 0 here because here's X 50 percent.
so this plus this X is going to turn out to be 1, 50 percent of the time.
now, how much of the time is Y going to turn out to be down here a . 1?
so suppose I put these probabilities, . 4?
now, so you see that X is--50 percent of the time X is 1
and 50 percent of the time X is minus 1.
now, how many of the times is Y 1 third, . 5+. 4
so 90 percent of the time, and then 10 percent of the time Y is minus 3.
so here's one way of putting probabilities on the dots that produces this outcome, but I could have chosen another way of doing it, the way that you probably had in mind where I assume they're totally independent.
that is, knowing the outcome of X in this way of doing it if I know that X turned out to be 1, Y has to turn out to be a third.
so they're very dependent.
x is somehow causing Y or determining Y.
x has a lot of information about Y.
suppose I make them independent?
I say what happens here has nothing to with what happens over there.
then I write the probabilities, instead of these
I'd write it . 45.
I'd take 1 half times . 9 is . 45, and then the chance that you go down for X, which is . 5 and up for Y which is also . 45 here, then I'd go . 05 here and . 05 there.
so here, knowing that Y has a good outcome tells you nothing about what X is going to do.
it's still equally likely X was good or bad.
knowing that Y had a bad outcome, X is still likely to be equally likely good or bad.
and similarly knowing the outcome of X tells you nothing about the outcome of Y.
this is 9 times this and this is . 9 times that.
so the yellow is independence, which is probability and)
equals the product, Probability times probability .
so that's the case in independence.
so in the case of independence, knowing something about one variable tells you nothing about what happened to the other variable but you could do other joint things.
so knowing each of them separately doesn't tell you how they're jointly distributed, and the covariance is an effort to see whether they're sort of correlated together or whether they're correlated independently.
so independence, by the way, independence implies covariance equals 0.
that's obvious because what's happening in the X variable's got nothing to do with what's happening in the Y variable.
so since it's linear in X you can hold Y fixed and the X is just the same and you're going to get something that adds up to 0.
so for any fixed value of Y this number will just give you the expectation of X, which won't depend on Y and it's going to be 0 in every case.
so therefore if they're independent their covariance has to be 0.
so, independence means X and Y tell you nothing.
that means the covariance is 0.
they could be positively distributed like up here or negatively distributed, either way you want to do it.
does that make sense? You asked me about this.
Prof: So what are the key simple observations here that are going to inform a lot of our behavior under uncertainty?
well, it's going to turn out that expectation is good and standard deviation is bad.
so if we take this variable that we just found
x and Y were both here, X and Y were both there.
all right, they each had standard deviation 1 and expectation 0, so this is the standard deviation.
so X is here, and by the way so is Y same thing.
well, suppose I put half my money into X and I put half my money into Y, and if I put half my money in each let's say I get half the payoff of each.
I make half a bet and get half the outcome.
what happens to my expectation?
well, the expectation of that obviously equals 1 half X bar +1 half Y bar which also equals 0.
so it's staying the same.
the expectation hasn't moved, but what's the variance of 1 half X 1 half Y?
well, by that formula it's the covariance--so I'm just going to do this formula.
I'm going to add a 1 half here and 1 half here.
so it's the same thing.
so it's the covariance of 1 half X with 1 half X +the covariance of 1 half Y and 1 half Y + 1 half and 1 half.
but the covariance of 1 half X with 1 half X is just okay, what is that?
it's the variance of 1 half X, but we already saw from our definition of variance over here remember, if you double X you're going to multiply the variance by 4 because you're squaring things.
so this is going to turn out to be 1 quarter times the variance of X.
and this, which is 1 half Y and 1 half Y, is going to be 1 quarter times the variance of Y.
and if the two are independent the covariance will be 0.
so in this example, these two variables if I take the orange distribution where they're independent I can do an X outcome and have this standard deviation and this expectation, 0 expectation and that standard deviation, I can do the Y thing get the same standard deviation or I can put half my money in each.
it seems like a total waste of time to put half my money in each.
after all, they give me the same standard deviation, but no, it isn't.
if they're independent you're shockingly, drastically reducing your standard deviation.
because if they're independent the covariance is 0 and so this plus this, the variance of X the variance of Y is just the half the variance of X = half the variance of Y.
so that's shocking.
so the standard deviation, therefore, the square root of that is 1 over the square root.
so by putting half your money in each you've now produced this when they're independent.
so this is the standard deviation of 1 half X 1 half Y independent.
you move from this point to that point.
you reduced your standard deviation without affecting your expectation.
so the first lesson that we're going to see applied this is all mathematics so mathematicians understood this of course, a long time ago, but to realize this has an application to economics wasn't so obvious although Shakespeare knew it.
it's diversification.
so don't put all your, you know, spread your investments out into different waters.
Shakespeare, you know, Antonio had a different ship on each ocean, so instead of putting all the ships on the same ocean he put them on different oceans which he assumed was independent.
so he had the same expected outcome assuming the paths were just as quick to wherever he was selling the stuff the same expected outcome and that each of the waters were equally dangerous, but he drastically reduced his variance.
and because there were a lot of oceans and a lot of ships this number went down further and further.
so the key is to look for independent risks.
so that's one lesson in mathematics that has a big application in economics.
what's a second thing?
well, the second thing is that if you add a bunch of risks together so I'm going to say this loosely.
if you add a bunch of risks together, so by the way what's the generalization of this before I say this?
if you had N independent risks with identical means and variances means let's call them all X bar and variances sigma squared.
let's say they all have expectation E and variance sigma each of them has that then what happens to the--so each of them has standard deviations, so they're all identical.
like X and Y have the expectation 0 and the same standard deviation 1.
suppose I had 20 of those and I put 1 twentieth of money into each of them?
what would happen to my expectation?
1 over N dollars in each one implies what happens to my expectation if expectation equal to what?
each of them had expectation E.
I now split my money among all of them, all with the same expectation.
that also has to have expectation E.
all right, just like this thing putting half my money in Y and half my money in X, wherever the X went.
y was over here.
x is there.
half my money in X and half my money in Y, is going to give me the same expectation.
if I had 12 projects like that that were independent I'd still have the same expectation, but my standard deviation what's going to happen to my standard deviation?
well, the variance is going to be--so what's going to happen to the standard deviation?
student: It would go down.
Prof: By what factor?
Yeah, what's going to happen to the variance?
Prof: Put 1 over N dollars in each of N identical but independent investments, what will my variance be?
Prof: The variance is going to equal 1 over N times sigma squared.
why is that?
because each one will have 1 over N dollars in it so its variance is going to be 1 over N squared times sigma squared, but there are N of them.
so it's going to be N times 1 over N squared so it's just 1 over N, so implies the standard deviation --so I'll call it standard deviation is 1 over the square root of N times sigma.
so it's just this generalization.
we've got 1 over the square root of 2, so if I did N of them instead of 2 of them I'd have 1 over the square root of N.
so those turn out to be very useful formulas which are going to come up over and over again.
and let's just say it again so you get this straight.
if I have two independent random variables and I split my money evenly between them and they have the same expectation it doesn't have to be 0, it could be a positive number if I split my money between them I haven't changed my expectation because each dollar, however I split it
I'm putting it into something with the same expectation.
but because they're independent you get a lot of off diagonal things happening.
the off diagonal things, remember, are canceling.
one investment is turning out well, X is--sorry that's on the diagonal.
the off diagonal elements are good in a way because if one investment's turning out well, sorry, turning out badly the other one's turning out well.
so here investment Y is turning out badly, but X is turning out well.
so to the extent you're off the diagonal you're canceling some of your bad outcomes because one's good and the other's bad.
so that way you leave the expectation the same but you reduce the variance.
in fact it would be even better if you could put everything on the off diagonal, but to the extent you get at least some stuff on the off diagonal you're reducing the risk.
and how fast do you reduce it when they're independent?
you reduce it dividing it equally because the variance is a squared thing, half your money in one and half in the other means the variance of the first is 1 quarter and the variance of the second is 1 quarter but now there are two of them so the total variance is 1 half of what it was before.
if you have 10 of them each one is 1 tenth the money so it's got 1
one-hundredth of the variance, but there are 10 of them so it's 10 one-hundredths, 1 over N of the variance.
if you take the standard deviation it's 1 over the square root of N.
so that's the rate at which you can reduce your uncertainty and your risk.
you'll see this gets much more concrete next lecture.
so this is just stuff that most of you know.
so one more thing, if you add a bunch of independent things together, independent random variables so I'm going to speak very loosely now variables, you get a normally distributed random variable normally distributed random variable with the corresponding expectation and standard deviation.
so what am I saying?
I don't want to speak too precisely about this because if you've seen this before and seen a proof you know everything about it, if you haven't it's just too many subtleties to absorb.
but the normal distributed random variable's the bell curve that looks like that.
it looks like this.
so there's the bell curve with expectation 0.
so it's this bell curve.
now, what's special about it, it has a particular formula which has got an exponential to a minus X squared thing.
anyway, it's got a particular formula to it which if you know you know, if you don't it's written down.
we're never going to use the exact formula but it looks like that.
so these are the outcomes X and this is the probability probability of outcome, or frequency of outcome.
so the bigger X is, and this is the mean--equals 0
I've assumed the mean is 0.
if you take a really big X it's very unlikely to happen and a really small X it's very unlikely to happen and X's nearer the mean are pretty likely to happen.
so anyway, it's amazing that if you add this random variable to itself a bunch of times it can only produce 1 and minus 1 right?
this one produces totally different outcomes 1 third and minus 3, they're disjoint outcomes but if you add this together you can get 25 1s and 10 minus 1s so that gives you 15.
over here you could have--25 will never get me there so sorry, that was a bad example.
if I had 30 things I could get 18 1s and 12 minus 1s that'll give me 6, you could have gotten 6 over here but with 30 outcomes you could get you know, all 30 of them could have turned out to be 1
and that would have gotten you pretty close to the same outcome.
so just because these outcomes are separate once you're adding them up you're starting to produce numbers different from 1 and minus 1
and these added up--if you take the right combination of 1 third and minus a third--you can start reproducing things.
like to get a 1 here you could produce three tops and then you're producing a 1.
so anyway, the shocking thing is if you add a bunch of these random variables that are independent to each other you get something normally distributed that looks like that because this random variable had exactly the same mean and standard deviation.
you add the same number of these you're going to get outcomes that are almost identically distributed.
so in the limit this random variable, enough of these added together looks exactly the same as these added together.
that's the second surprising mathematical fact.
and the third thing that we're going to use is that the normal distribution is characterized by the mean and standard deviation that's all it takes to write the formula of this down and these numbers, these are called thin tailed.
these probabilities go to 0 very fast, so you shouldn't expect many outlying dramatic things to happen.
and in the world they do happen, and so we're going to see that much of classical economics is built on normally distributed things and so you can't see
you shouldn't expect any gigantic outliers to ever happen.
and it seems natural to build it on that kind of assumption because if you add things that are independent you get normal distributions all the time.
and things seem independent so why shouldn't you get normal distributions, and yet we must not get it because we have so many outliers.
so that's the basic background of mathematics.
are there any questions about any of that?
I'm just assuming you know all that and now we're going to move to economics.
I think that's all the background you need.
I want to do one more thing, which is maybe background but it's used in economics all the time, and it's called the iterated expectations.
so if I told you that these variables were correlated like these up here, like the orange things if I told you what X turned out to be that would tell you a lot about what Y was going to be.
so for example, if I told you that X was sorry, the white ones are the correlated ones.
if I tell you that X has turned out to be 1, that tells you that
y has to be a good outcome of 1 third, because if X is one this never happens.
so the only thing that can happen if X is 1 is that Y turns out to be 1 third, so knowing X is going to completely change your mind about the expectation of Y.
so conditional expectation, I should have said this before conditional expectation simply means re-computing expectation using updated probabilities from your information.
now, you've probably done this in high school so I'm just going to assume you know how to do this.
so in this case if I tell you something like X has turned out to be 1 that tells you that only these two outcomes are possible.
so that means that the only two outcomes in the white case have happened with probability of . 5 and 0
but if I tell you X has come out to 1 the conditional probabilities have to add up to 1.
so you just scale things up.
so you know that Y had to have been the good outcome up here.
if I tell you that the bad outcome for Y has happened then you have probabilities of . 1--so this 0 makes things too easy.
suppose I tell you the good outcome of Y has happened.
what are the chances now that X has gotten the good outcome in the white probability case?
if I tell you that Y turned out to be 1 third in the white probability case what's the probability that X turned out to be 1, conditional on that?
student: 5 ninths.
Prof: 5 ninths, so that's it because the probabilities are now--you're reduced with . 4 and . 5
so 5 ninths of the time.
so that's an idea which I assume you all can--it's very intuitive, and it's way too long to explain, and I'm sure you know how to do that.
so anyway, the conditional expectation, blah so the iterated expectation is simply this.
it's an obvious idea, but it's going to be incredibly useful to us.
it says if you ask me what are the chances that the Yankees are going to win the World Series against the Dodgers
let's suppose that's who's going to play the Yankees are going to beat the Dodgers what's the probability that's going to happen?
what do you expect the chances are?
if I then ask you my opinion after the first game well, obviously if the Yankees win the first game my opinion's going to go up, so I'm going to have a different opinion.
if the Dodgers win the first game my opinion is going to go down so I'll have a different opinion.
but you can ask now another question, what's your expected opinion going to be?
so the law of iterated expectations is the expectation of X has to equal the expected expectation of X given some information.
so here is what I think.
the Yankees are 70 percent likely to win.
if I say after the first game if the Yankees win
I'll think it's 80 percent and after the first game if the Dodgers win I'll think it's gone down to 65 percent, it had better be that the average of my opinions after the information is the same as the number I started with.
that's just common sense and I'm not going to bother to prove that.
so that's incredibly important.
it's not only the expectation of X but as you learn stuff you can anticipate your opinion's going to change, but your average opinion has to always stay the same as X was.
so that's the last of the background.
and now I want to do a simple application of this.
so in fact, to that very question, suppose that you're playing a World Series.
the Yankees are playing the Dodgers and let's suppose that the Yankees have a 60 percent chance of winning any game.
I'll just do it here.
the Yankees have a 60 percent chance of winning any game.
what's the chance the Yankees win a 3 game world series?
how do you figure that out?
well, a naive way, a simple way of figuring that out is to say, well, what could happen?
life can mean a Yankee win, let's call that an up or a Yankee loss, let's call that a down and this could happen with probability . 6 or . 4.
the Yankees could win again, so that's probability . 6.
we have two Yankee wins, or the Yankees could lose the second game so that's probability . 4.
the Yankees could lose or could win.
that's . 6 and this is . 4, and we've only played 2 games.
the Yankees could win a third--well you don't need to play this game because they've already won a three game series, but if you did it wouldn't matter, . 4, or we could go up or down.
the Yankees after winning and losing could then win probability . 6, or could lose or after losing and winning they could win again or they could lose.
after losing and winning they could lose, so this is probability . 4 and this is . 6, and then finally we have this and we have this.
so this is . 6 and . 4.
so this is what the tree looks like.
you could imagine 8 possible paths each of length 3 where you give the whole sequence of wins and losses.
so to compute the probability that the Yankees win you look at all the--so in this case the Yankees win.
they would have already won here, but if you play it out it doesn't matter.
they're going to win here and here.
they've got two wins and one loss.
here they've got one win, two wins and one loss. They win.
here they've got loss, win, win.
they win the World Series.
here they lose, win, lose.
they lose the World Series.
here's lose, win--it's win lose, lose, they also lose the World Series.
here it's lose, lose, they've lost the World Series, loss.
so these are the possible outcomes.
so you could compute the probability of every path there are 8 of them, and then multiply that probability by the outcome and you'll get the chance that the
Yankees will win the World Series, right?
that's clear to everybody?
but there's a much faster way of doing it and putting it on a computer, and that's using the law of the iterated expectation.
so first of all--so this is called a tree.
so we're going to use trees all the time.
so tree, I don't want to formally define it.
it's just you start with something and stuff can happen.
stuff happens every period, and so you just write down all the things that can happen.
and then you write down all the things that can happen after that and the thing unfolds like a tree.
that's formal enough to describe a tree and here we've got it.
but you notice that the tree the number of things happening grows exponentially.
it's horrible to have to compute something growing exponentially but they're often recombining trees.
Oh, so if I ask, by the way, in this tree whatever the opinion is here, which turns out to be . 68 something yeah, I should have asked you to guess, . 68 something.
if you write down the opinion that opinion has to be the average of the opinion here and the opinion here.
so if I take the opinion here times . 6 plus the opinion here times . 4 that's also going to equal . 68.
and that's what's going to be the key to computing the thing much faster rather than going through every branch which is such a pain because there are an exponentially growing number of paths very bad to have to compute by hand.
but we notice that we can look at a recombining tree.
these two nodes are essentially the same.
what difference does it make if the Yankees win one and lose one, or lose one and win one?
in both cases they're at the same spot.
they're even in the World Series.
and since we assume the probability of winning any game is the same, . 6 and . 4, independent of what's happened before--you might think you're learning something about, "Oh, their starter pitched here and he didn't last the whole game" and stuff like that.
so I'm not allowing for any of that.
I'm just saying it's a chance for the Yankees to win no matter what happens.
so all you care about at any point from then on is who's won how many games.
so these nodes are basically identical and these nodes are identical, because it all ended up with the Dodgers ahead 2 to 1, and here the Yankees were ahead 2 to 1, and here the Yankees were ahead 3 to 0, and 0 to 3.
so the recombining tree which has all the same information is just this, this, this, this tree.
so this three only has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
has far--it's 1 node, 2 nodes, 3 nodes and 4 nodes as time goes by growing linearly instead of growing 1
to 2, to 4, to 8 which is growing exponentially.
so I could have a very long World Series and write it as a finite tree and just . 6 and . 4 here at every stage.
so how am I going to solve this now?
well, over here I know the Yankees ended up winning all 3 games.
here they won 2, here they won 1
here they won none.
so those are the outcomes.
so instead of trying to figure out path by path through these exponential number of paths what the chances of each path are, why it's hard to compute here it's . 6 times . 6 times . 4, a complicated calculation
I'm now going to do something simple.
I'm going to say, what would I think if the
Yankees had already won 2 games?
well, I know that they would win.
that's a 1.
the series is already over.
what would I think after the Dodgers won the first two games?
I'd know it was over.
what would I think--so how did I get that?
it's . 6 times 1+. 4 times 1.
that's 1, the Dodgers . 6 times 0+. 4 times 0 that's 0
so that's my opinion if the Dodgers win 2 games.
here's my opinion if the Yankees won 2 games.
what would my opinion be if they split?
well, if they split what would my opinion be if I started here?
so after game 2 they've each won 1 game.
I don't know who won the first one, but it was 1 to 1 after 2 games.
now what would I think?
student: . 6 times 1+. 4 times 0.
Prof: Exactly, so it's . 6.
it's . 6 times 1+. 4 times 0.
so the odds, I would think the Yankees would win the World Series here with 1 game left knowing that they win 60 percent of the time it's . 6.
but now what do I think if the Yankees win the first game?
what's my opinion?
student: . 6 times 1+. 4 times . 6.
Prof: So it's . 6 times 1
so it's . 6+. 4 times . 6, so that's . 24
so that's . 84 here, and what's my opinion after the
Yankees lose the first game and the Dodgers win?
what do I think is going to happen?
what will my opinion be here?
it's . 6 times having an opinion of . 6, so it's . 36, . 4 times knowing that it's all over . 4 times 0.
so it's equal to . 36.
so I've now figured out--not only am I solving this thing much faster than I could over there, but I'm finding interesting numbers on the way.
I'm now figuring out what would I think after the Yankees won the first game?
well, now I think it's 84 percent.
what would I think after the Dodgers won the first game?
I'd think it was only a 36 percent chance of the Yankees winning.
so now what's my opinion at the very beginning?
it's . 6 times . 84 (it's my chance of having this opinion plus my chance of having that opinion). 4 times . 36.
Oh no, . 504 +. 144 what is that?
student: . 648.
Prof: . 648, 6 times 84 looks like 504 and 4 times 36
looks like 144, so it looks like . 648 and that's what you said.
so that's it. I've solved it now.
so that's the method of iterated expectation and we're going to turn this into quite an interesting theory in a second but I want to now put that on a computer to show you just how completely obvious this is, I mean, not obvious fast this is.
so you could solve for any number of--a series of any length you could instantly solve.
now, we're going to price bonds that way too.
so class--so what did I do? I--this is a spreadsheet you had.
I simply had the probabilities of the Yankees winning which was . 6
which I could change.
Prof: So this is the simplest thing to do but now suppose that--so we said the Yankees can win every game with probability . 6.
so then what did I do?
I went down to here.
I gave myself some room.
I didn't do a very long series.
so now what does each of these things say?
each of these nodes, like that one says if I can read it, it says--so this is my opinion of winning the World Series.
it says my opinion here is going be the chance I go up.
that's the probability, that's A 2
that's . 6, the chance I go up times what my opinion would be over here, plus the chance that I go down which is here, the chance I go to here which is 1 minus that number . 6 that's frozen up there times whatever I thought would be my opinion here.
so you see that's the same--I just write that once.
I wrote that once here, that thing about the probability, my opinion there is the probability of going up.
that's A, dollar A dollar 2, that's . 6
it's frozen, times what my opinion would be and the square over 1 and up 1 plus 1 minus dollar A dollar 2
times my opinion over 1 and down 1.
so I just copied that as many times I wanted to down the column and then I copied it again across all the rows.
so all of these entries are identical, they're all just copies of each other.
so it's just says iterate your opinion from what you know it was forward.
now, how do I take a 3 game World Series?
well, we're starting here.
this'll be game 1, game 2, game 3
so all I have to do now is put 1s everywhere here like 1 enter and now I'll copy this, ctrl, copy and go all the down here.
so that's it. So we've got all the numbers.
so why is that?
because my opinion here--remember the numbers we got?
the series goes 1 game, 2 games, 3 games so if you end up above the middle that means the Yankees won the majority of games.
your pay off is 1.
your probability of the Yankees wining is 1.
so now what's your opinion going to be?
if you've won 2 games then the Yankees have to have won.
what if the Yankees win the first game?
remember the numbers we got 1, and . 6, and 0
so here's the . 84.
it's the average of 1 and . 6.
here's the . 36 which was the average of . 6 and 0.
and then we come down to the middle which is . 648.
so what do I do if I want to play a 7 game World Series?
I have to get rid of this, and if it's a 7 game World
series I would just--now I want to restore what I had before, so I'm going to copy all this ctrl, copy, ctrl.
so I'm back to where I was before.
so you see what I'm doing here?
the game hasn't started.
this is the first game, second game third game, fourth game, fifth game, sixth game, seventh game.
every square is just saying my opinion is my average of what my opinion will be next time.
if I want to make it a 7 game World Series I just plug in 1s here.
there must be some faster way of doing this but I plug in 1s here.
so ctrl, copy and here are all the 1s down to above the thing ctrl V, and now I've solved my opinion backwards and I've got the chances of the Yankees winning a 7 game World Series are 71 percent.
so the longer the World Series goes the better the chances are the Yankees win if they're better in each individual game and you can do it instantly.
so are there any questions about that?
so that is a trick we're going to use over and over again to price bonds.
you do it by backward induction because of the law of iterated expectations.
your opinion today of what's going to happen way in the future when you get a lot of information has to be the average opinion you're going to have after you get some information, but before you know what the final outcome is.
and so realizing that, you just take the pieces of information one by one and work backwards from the end and you can solve things instantly which would take in the brute force way an exponentially growing length of time to do if you did them path by path.
I now want to turn to an application of this to one subject which is, let's just not do the World Series.
let's do a more interesting problem.
I hope I have time to finish this story.
so the more interesting problem is this.
let's suppose our uncertainty's of a different kind.
instead of not knowing the outcome of the World Series let's say we don't know how impatient we are.
so remember the most important idea so far that we've seen because we haven't done uncertainty yet the most important idea we've seen so far is impatience.
that's the reason why you get an interest rate and the interest rate is the key to finding out the value of everything.
so Irving Fisher put tremendous weight on impatience.
and now that we're talking about uncertainty the natural thing to make uncertain is how impatient you're going to be.
so we want to talk a little bit more about impatience.
so impatience by Irving Fisher is the discount.
so in fact I want to talk about this in sort of realistic terms.
do we really believe that people just discount the future 1 year they discount by delta, 2 years discount by delta squared 3 years by delta cubed, 4 years by delta to the fourth.
is it really true that every year people think of as delta less important as the year before?
I mean, the argument for this is you might not live beyond a certain--you know, poor imagination so imagination, poor imagination we've said this before, poor imagination and mortality are the two arguments for discounting.
but let me tell a story that seems to contradict that.
suppose someone asks you to clean your room and they give you a choice of doing it--I can give my son for example.
say I--"Clean your room Constantin
and so if I say do it today or do it tomorrow that makes a huge difference to him, I mean just a huge difference doing it today from doing it tomorrow.
he'll think doing it today is just impossible doing it tomorrow I can almost force him into agreeing to that.
so clearly there's a big discount between today and tomorrow but what about between a year from now and a year and a day from now?
do you think Constantin will think there's any difference in that?
the answer is no.
if I say, "Constantine, do you agree to clean it 365
days from now or 366 days from now, " to him there's hardly any difference, but there's hardly any tradeoff.
one is hardly more valuable than the other of course, they're both pretty unimportant, but the ratio of the two doesn't even seem important to him.
so that's called hyperbolic discounting.
if you do any experiment with people or with animals you make a bird do something and if he does more stuff he gets the things faster, he'll do a lot of stuff to get it in the next minute as opposed to in 2 minutes but the difference between what he'll do in 10 minutes versus 11
minutes is very small.
so hyperbolic discounting is discounting much less than exponential discounting.
so this has a tremendous importance for the environment.
if you thought that people exponentially discounted like they thought each year was only 95 percent if the interest rate's 5 percent it sounds like the discounting is . 95, so if next year's only 95 percent as important as this year and the year after that is only 95 percent as important as the first year, and the third year is only 95 percent as important as the second year . 95 in 100 years to the hundredth is an incredibly small number.
so there's no point in doing something today and investing a lot resources in order to clean up the environment and help people 100 years from now, because by discounting it this much nobody could, you know, what's the difference because the future's so unimportant.
you shouldn't be investing resources now to do something that's going to have such a small effect later.
so in all the reports on the environment a crucial half of the report is devoted to what the discount rate should be.
so, but they never thought of doing the most obvious thing which is to ask what would happen if the discounting was uncertain.
all of these are certain discount rates.
so what if you made the discounting uncertain what would you imagine doing?
so suppose you discount today at 100 percent and maybe next period you're going to discount at 200 percent this is the interest rate and here it might go down to 50 percent.
it could go up to 400 percent or it could go down to 100
percent again, or it could go down to 25 percent you know, this kind of discounting I have in mind.
you don't know--so delta = 1 over , and this is r r_0, r_up, r_down.
so maybe the discount is uncertain and it goes like that.
so it's a geometric random walk.
I keep multiplying or dividing by 2.
I multiply or divide by 2. I multiply or divide by 2.
that seems to make for a lot of discounting.
these numbers are going up very fast.
the higher the r, the less you care about the future.
so the question is if you ask for a dollar sometime in the future what will people be willing to pay for it?
so you know today that you think the future is only half as important as the present.
let's say these all have probability of half.
and tomorrow it might be that you think the future is only 2 thirds the next year's only 2 thirds as important as that current year or you might think the future's only 1 third as important as this year.
so you see how this is working?
two years from now you might think the future's only 1 fifth the third year's only 1 fifth as important as the second year.
here you might think the third year is half as important as the second year.
here you might think it's 4 fifths as important as the third [correction: second]year.
so you don't know what it's going to be and if anything this process seems to give you a bias towards getting really high numbers, high discounts meaning the future doesn't matter.
so, but nobody bothered to stop--so this is the most famous interest rate process in finance.
this is called the Ho-Lee interest rate model where you think today's interest rate might be 4 percent.
maybe it'll be 10 percent higher next year or 10 percent lower and it'll keep going up and down like that and that's the uncertainty about the interest rate.
so if we think interest rates are so important and patience is so important, and we want to add uncertainty the first place to do it is to the interest rate and the Ho-Lee model in finance does that.
nobody bothered to compute this out more than 30 years.
compute what out?
suppose you get 1 dollar for sure in year 1.
how much would you pay for 1 dollar in year 1?
well, your discount is 100 percent.
you'd pay 1 half a dollar.
how much would you pay for 1 dollar in year 2?
well, you know how much more a dollar now is worth than 1 year from now, but you don't know 2 years from now so you have to work by backward induction.
here 1 dollar for sure is worth 1 dollar.
what would I pay for it here?
I'd pay 1 third of a dollar.
what would I pay for it here?
well, the discount is 2 thirds.
I'd pay 2 thirds of a dollar.
so what would I pay for it back here?
I'd pay 1 half times 1 third+1 half times 2 thirds discounted by 100 percent.
so that's 1 third+1 sixth which is 1 half, times 1 half which is 1 quarter, I guess.
so I'd pay 1 quarter.
so for any time I could figure out D = amount I would pay
I'm going to be done in one minute the amount I would pay today for 1 dollar for sure at time t.
and that number, obviously, is going to go down as time goes up, and we know how to compute it by backward induction.
you just put the 1s further and further out and then you go backwards by backward induction.
but just like for the World Series I could do that any T however big I want to, and on a computer and the spreadsheet which I wrote for you you could do this instantly.
and nobody bothered to do this for T bigger than 30 because bonds basically don't last for more than 30 years so what's the point in doing it for T bigger than 30?
so 100 years--there are virtually no financial instruments that are 100 years long because they didn't bother to do this.
suppose you did it for every T up to 1, 000 years?
well, you could do it on a computer very easily.
you could even prove a theorem of what it's like.
so in the problem set I'm going to ask you do a few of these and what you're going to find is that people are hyperbolic that you get--you discount a lot.
it's pretty close to 100 percent for the first few periods but after that you're going to be anyway, you're going to find out what the numbers turn out to be when you do it on a computer.
so we're going to start with random interest rates next period the most important variable in the economy.
you made me give up the FBI.
please, Jana.
I'm here for you when you need anything.
you've been so good to me.
who are you, Lily Gray?
I'm a woman who has been waiting for this moment for a very long time.
and how is Ryan?
I'm interested in one thing.
I want to kill Joe Carroll.
something tells me that home, sweet, home is very close by.
I want to spend some time with Joe without interruption.
why are you being so nice to me?
I like you, Emma.
you left me all alone.
Where's Giselle?
Where's Joe Carroll?
where is Max?
dead! I killed her.
No!
did you lock us in here?
mother doesn't want to be disturbed.
I'm sorry.
where have you been?
I will not be controlled.
I don't want to control you.
I wouldn't want you if I could.
no. You're way better in bed.
I mean, you're a way better cuddle buddy than Laura.
no. I know, I know.
Yeah.
what's up?
When'd you get home?
uh, a little while ago.
what-- what's going on?
someone-- someone in there with you?
uh, yeah. It's, um-- it's Giselle.
Oh. Giselle's back. Awesome!
Hey. Look, Mark. We're, uh, kind of in the middle of something, you know?
no. I don't know. Let me in.
OK, ok.
we didn't want you to find out this way, but, you know, there's always been that unspoken thing between Giselle and I?
well, we've been exploring it.
what are you talking about?
what?
what-- what happened? Gis...
she-- she's dead.
no, no. She's just-- she's just sleeping is all.
Luke, what did you do to her?
I didn't do anything. She's just
Hey, Giselle. Wake up, wake up.
Hey. Come on. Wake up!
Hey. Wake up. Come on.
Hey. Wake up.
Luke, Luke, she's dead!
don't say that!
she's...
she's not dead.
who did this?
Ryan Hardy killed her.
let me get this straight...
for this to be a photograph of who you say it is, someone would have had to swapped all of the DNA records in Sentinel, both digital and hard copies, know the exact warehouse where the physical DNA was stored, and replace it.
let me finish.
and replace it with Carroll's illegitimate brother's DNA.
look. The sheriff in Havenport last year Tim Nelson, AKA Roderick, was Joe Carroll's number two guy.
he infiltrated law enforcement for years.
that was a sheriff's department.
we're the FBI.
there are no killer cult moles in the FBI.
there were several key moments unaccounted for last year where Carroll's cult was ahead of us.
and it had to have been a mole?
it had nothing to do with incompetence?
I'm sorry.
listen. You're a consultant here, and if this case is getting to be too much for you...
no. I'm fine.
are you sure?
I was briefed. I know last year left some scars, your psych eval's still pending.
all I'm saying is that you're free to go home.
everyone here would understand.
authorities are continuing to search for former Soho gallery owner Lily Gray, who's now under suspicion of being involved...
Hey. Relax. It's me.
you ok?
you've been gone a long time.
I had to drive a ways to find 24-hour pharmacy.
OK. All right. We have bandages, we have peroxide, needle and thread.
did you bring any vodka?
very funny.
law enforcement officials continue to ask...
Giselle knew we were here.
if she told someone, they're gonna come for us.
gave the manager 50 bucks to give us a heads-up if he saw anyone.
I'm gonna stitch you up, we get out of here.
I broke into that woman's home.
I tried to remove the evidence, but I had to make a run for it.
local police could be processing it now.
I left blood, I left clothes, I left prints.
it's gonna take time for them to tie it to New York unless you want to call the FBI and help it along, hmm?
I thought you were dead.
I know, but I wasn't.
OK, ok, ok.
Hey. How about you take the car and head back to New York?
no way.
look at you. You could be dead.
you still think you can do this alone.
I don't get it.
it's Weston.
it's me.
Ryan, are you all right? Where are you?
I'm in Stratford, Connecticut.
I found Lily and the twins.
you called me?
Yeah. Surprise.
I need your help, Mike.
I don't want to screw this up.
are you ok? Did-- did something happen?
Yeah, but there's no time.
I'm in a motel. I'm at Oak and 6th, room 7.
call everyone in, ATF, SWAT, police.
Lily Gray doesn't just have twins.
she's got a whole family.
I don't know how many.
yeah?
is Joe Carroll with them?
I'm pretty sure he is.
I'm on my way.
I could stay like this forever.
I wouldn't object to that.
but there's so much to do.
you know we can't stay here.
sooner or later, they're gonna find this place.
do you want a drink?
Yeah, please.
but I take it you have somewhere in mind, huh?
of course I have a plan, Joe.
I knew once I was exposed to the world everything would change, so I've made provisions.
I have a plane.
it's at an airstrip near here.
we could fly to Boston tonight and take a private jet to Venezuela.
I own an estate there.
it's on the coast.
it's lovely.
Yeah. That sounds, uh...
that sounds very nice, but, um...
why Venezuela?
well, there's no extradition, for one.
that adds a certain safety.
we could get new identities.
you'd write, and I'd paint.
you'd publish under a pseudonym.
it would be just you and me and the kids, and Emma and Mandy would join us, too.
we'd be a family.
that's a great deal to consider.
what's to consider?
it's perfect.
what other options do you have?
there're always options, Lily.
go away.
What?!
where were you?
what happened to her?
Ryan Hardy killed her, killed Jamel, too.
why didn't you tell me about Ryan?
how could you hide this from me?
he surprised me!
I was-- I was in the moment!
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna kill him, mom!
I'm gonna kill him! He's not gonna get away with it.
he's-- he's not gonna-- he's not gonna get away with it.
he's not gonna get away with it.
he's not gonna-- he's not gonna get away with it!
Luke, stop it!
look at me.
we have to keep ourselves together.
Ryan has to pay for what he did.
he will, but if Ryan's near, we are all in danger, and we have to leave.
he's-- he's with his niece.
no one else. Giselle told me.
they're staying at some motel in Stratford.
I shot him. He's hurt. Let me go finish him off, mom.
shut up!
go tell everyone we have to leave a soon as possible, but don't mention Ryan Hardy to Joe or Emma or that other-- whatever the hell her name is-- Mandy.
you're worried about Joe finding out.
Giselle is dead, mom.
and as far as I understand it, that is entirely your fault.
now is not the time to test me, Luke.
we're leaving in the morning.
how do you feel?
great, doctor. Good as new.
so where's the cavalry?
something's wrong. It should take the FBI 15 minutes to get here by helicopter.
did you drive?
can I come in?
Yeah. Sorry.
Hello, again.
you two know each other?
we met. Briefly.
so where is everybody? We need manpower.
there isn't anybody else. It's just me.
what do you mean it's just you?
we need roadblocks, aerial searches.
I think the FBI might be compromised.
have you seen Joe? Is he up yet.
in English, please.
Emma.
have you seen Joe?
he's in Lily's room, where he's been all night.
they had sex.
what?
it was pretty intense.
the doors around here are thick, and I still heard it.
what's wrong?
nothing.
Really? Because you look like just sucked a lemon.
why is everyone packing?
I don't know. Why don't you ask?
that's Joe.
no. That is Joe. The girl is the daughter of one his prison pen pals.
Ryan, I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
so Joe has someone on the inside.
he had to. He was tipped off at every turn.
you know, Roderick went to the academy in Virginia.
and the militia boys in Havenport, they had several ties to the FBI.
now I want to pursue this, but the minute I open an investigation they're gonna know.
no. You don't want to tip them off. You're right not to.
you said Lily and the twins were here.
they're somewhere in Stratford.
Yeah, but we don't have an exact location.
we're pretty sure they know we're here, and I think they're pissed because I killed two of their family.
they'll show up.
that's your plan?
pretty much.
we need a better plan.
look. We're sitting ducks here.
we need to be smart about this.
come on. Let's go.
Oh, now you're the gentleman?
sorry about the other day.
save it.
excuse me, sir.
Hey, punk.
there you are.
look. I'm sorry, but we, uh, we need to talk.
it's quite urgent.
Lily's leaving.
I noticed.
Yeah. She wants us to go with her to Venezuela.
you're kidding.
she's got it all worked out.
she's got a big house on the ocean, she's offering us money and protection, and Venezuela's got very strong extradition laws.
sounds awesome.
Yeah. Yeah. Guess it does.
and she wants, uh-- She thinks I should write a new novel.
have you read it?
what, this? Yeah.
it's fabricated myth, half facts.
it's, uh, it's wretched.
in other words, the truth.
Yeah. Yeah. I suppose it is.
still horribly written, though.
and yet...
it's still better than anything I could write.
I'm no writer. I...
never was.
no. It's high time that I-- I stop pretending that I'm something I'm not, and I can't go to Venezuela.
I'll only disappoint a new group of people.
so what are you going to do?
well, I suspect I don't have much time left on this Earth, but whatever time I do have,
I know I want it to be better than this.
so you have a plan?
Yeah.
Yes, I do. I have an epic plan.
will it work? I don't know. Heh.
I can't promise you anything...
but I can promise you my loyalty.
I'll never take you for granted again.
I need you, em.
please will you come with me?
I'm tired of running, Joe.
I told the manager we were taking him back to New York.
he'd prefer we keep his fine establishment out of it.
that's his car over there.
looks like he came alone.
can you run his plates?
Yeah. - They're fakes.
you won't find anything.
Wow.
your lips are perfect, you know that?
I found this on him.
so...
any chance you're gonna tell us where that crazy mother of yours is?
she's with Joe.
now doesn't that make you squirm knowing you're so close but not?
you know what makes me squirm?
the thought of killing you and then doing things to you.
one more, please.
you got it.
Really?
Hey. You ok?
Yeah, I'm fine.
you sure you're up for this?
we got to keep our heads straight.
coming from you, Ryan, that carries a lot of weight.
really. - No. All I'm saying is...
Hey. I got it.
I'm good.
Hi, sweetie. Are you all done packing?
I don't have much.
Oh. You excited to go to Venezuela?
I don't even know where that is.
you're gonna love it.
my house there is much nicer than this one, and it's on the ocean, and you'll have lots of things to do.
I've never been on an airplane before.
well, you're in for a treat.
I hope. We really have to hurry.
are you sure Joe wants to go?
have you heard something else?
not really.
I'd really like to come with you.
I like being here with your family.
sweetheart...
this is your family, too, now.
maybe you should talk to Joe.
um, just...
excuse me. Heh.
Luke got held up by me.
Where's my son?
he's in my backseat bleeding.
Ryan, where are you?
close enough that I could have the FBI on you in a matter of minutes, but I think you know all I really want is Joe Carroll.
if anything happens to my son, there will be no end to your suffering.
don't be so melodramatic.
I want to make a trade,
your son for Joe Carroll.
so listen close.
there's a dam off Route 22.
the road's closed. I'll be waiting.
you cross me, and I will kill Luke just I killed your other two sick psycho kids.
I'll be there.
all packed?
Yeah. Ready.
any problems?
no problems.
I brought you lunch.
Oh. Hmm. Lovely.
OK. The truth.
everything's not all right.
what's wrong?
Ryan Hardy's in town.
and you know this how?
because he followed Giselle to a nearby town and he killed her.
he killed her?
Yes. He stabbed her in the chest.
she was very dear to me.
so Ryan Hardy is nearby.
Yes, and he's taken Luke captive.
he's offered a deal, a trade really.
you for my son.
let me know where he is, and I'll-- I'll take care of him.
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
I've sacrificed too much, Joe.
I'm not willing to give up on you.
whoa. Did you, um...
did you just...
Oh, you-- you-- you-- ohh-- ohh!
it's all right, it's all right.
I understand you might be a little upset about this.
you're clear on what needs to be done?
Yes.
we'll see you at the airstrip once I have Luke.
if Emma and Mandy give you problems, kill them.
you at the dam?
where are you?
I'm almost there.
hurry.
have you seen Joe?
no. Did he leave with Lily and Mark?
mark and Lily left?
we're supposed to go with Sami and Radmila to the airport.
wait. No. Airstrip.
it's a small plane that's gonna take us to the jet!
how do you know this?
I ask questions, Emma.
look. I think something is wrong.
help me find Joe.
OK. You're so uptight.
what's wrong with him?
I think he's drugged.
Joe, come on. Come on. Wake up! Joe!
OK. Time to see mommy.
that's not Joe Carroll!
and you're not Ryan Hardy!
where is he?
drop your gun, little girl.
not till he drops his.
Where's Joe Carroll?
I realized I was at a disadvantage.
Luke's well-being is important to me, whereas you couldn't care less whether Joe Carroll lives or dies, so I needed leverage.
the kind gentleman here was, uh, sweet enough to give us a ride.
I know how you law people revere the innocent, so tell Ryan to get out from wherever he is hiding.
Ryan's not here.
Luke shot him, remember?
he can't even walk.
I know you didn't come here on your own.
I'm right here!
don't hurt him.
drop your gun.
mark, lose your gun.
throw your gun over the railing!
now!
Oops. I guess I throw like a girl.
give me my brother!
Hey. Come and get him. I dare you.
Yeah. That's it. Go ahead. Grab it.
bet Max has got better reflexes than you.
come on! This game of chicken is getting old.
someone's got to make a move.
I'll make a move.
the choice is simple.
this man's life for my son's freedom.
No!
Aah!
try that again, bitch!
give me my son.
now!
let him go!
let him go!
must be awful being the good guys.
so many rules.
I need an ambulance at the Dover dam.
stab wound to the back.
go, Mike, go!
Mandy, grab me that perfume.
OK.
OK. Come on, Joe.
come on.
Oh. All right.
it's ok. I think Lily drugged you.
Yeah. Yeah. Ok.
OK. We got to-- we got to go.
come on. Come on.
where you go?
uh, there's been a change of plan.
all right. Turning around.
Russian's got a gun.
you stay here until Lily calls.
you're not gonna shoot me.
I'm Lily's pet.
get your stuff. Come on.
we got to go.
you really scared me.
Oh. Trust, mouse.
trust!
any words from Mike Weston?
none, but we just got word of a B&E in a home in Stratford, Connecticut.
woman was held hostage.
turned into a shootout between two men.
Stratford? That's on the New Haven line.
stratford police pulled prints at the house.
we got a match on one of the twins and the female Hardy was tailing.
alert the local police.
I want intel on every bus and train station, airfield, and interstate out of Stratford.
call Phillips, fill him in, get me a chopper.
on it.
help!
Where's Joe Carroll?
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.
where are they going?
where are they going?
listen to me. Joe turned on you.
he betrayed Lily.
where is he?
airfield. Tillman Road.
hit redial.
mark, where are you?
we're at the bridge.
it all went to hell, Emma. We got Luke, but the FBI, they're after us.
Ryan came to the house.
he killed Sami and Radmila.
I have Joe. Where is the airstrip?
it's on Tillman Road.
we'll-- we'll meet you there in 20 minutes.
just wait for us.
the pilot will be ready.
I think we can beat.
we need to get to that plane before they do.
we have to go! We have to go!
Where's Luke?
Where's Luke?!
No! No, no!
No! Come back!
I got to get Luke.
no. It's too late. Drive.
drive. Drive!
Mike, stop!
Mike, stop it!
are you the pickup?
Yeah. We got to leave right away.
I thought there'd be more of you.
none. They're not coming.
watch your step.
yeah?
what?
where is he? - I don't know.
where is he?
I don't know!
where did he go?
the man got a call. He told the girls to get off.
I was going home. I haven't been paid.
OK. This man. Did you recognize him?
no.
it was Joe Carroll.
Joe Carroll? The killer guy?
he's dead, isn't he?
all right, guys. Let's hold him for questioning, please.
Hey, hey. Listen. I saw Joe.
he's got to be close. You need to set up roadblocks now!
if Joe Carroll is alive,
I will deal with it, not you!
I guess destroying your own career wasn't enough.
congratulations, Ryan. They are both done.
Hey.
you ok? I'm sorry.
I'm good. You?
Yes. I'm just not so sure about your friend Weston.
it's not my blood. It's Luke's.
he nearly killed him. They transported him to a secure hospital in New York.
he might not survive.
what's going on with you?
Joe was here.
you saw him?
I nearly had him. He got away.
he could be anywhere now.
somebody tipped him off. You're right, Mike.
somebody inside the FBI is helping him.
we can't trust anybody now.
no. Thank you, Jana.
you saved us. I'm in debt to you, and I'll be in touch.
Heh. Yes. Good-bye, sweetheart.
who's Jana?
she's Joe's friend.
her daughter gave me this ring.
Jana is an old friend with many useful resources.
she FBI?
no. She's more of a stay-at-home mom these days, but she still consults occasionally.
she said to head west on the back roads.
the local police have started blocking the major interstate.
no need to worry. We have plenty of time.
it's Lily.
well, put her on speaker.
Hello, Lily.
you got away?
the FBI's all over the airstrip.
we couldn't get close.
no. We're fine.
they killed Luke.
they killed my son.
Yeah. I know that means something to you, Lily, but frankly, I was never fond of the boy.
what?
Yeah. You drugged me.
you tried to control me.
as far as I'm concerned, you are getting exactly what you deserved.
you ungrateful bastard.
I gave up everything for you.
I lost my son.
Ah. I'm done with you, Lily, you and your international house of psychos.
you don't mean that.
Oh, yes. Yes, I do, and I also mean this.
good-bye.
you know, she's a bit of a drama queen.
you all right, mother?
you-- look. Let me-- let me...
west. 10: 02 P. M
I shouldn't have even brought it up. 11 HOURS LATER
any sicko who peeps on my l. T. Answers to me.
it's not a case, and even if it were, I'd be clinically insane to assign it to you.
well, then let us just ask around...
and see if anybody saw anything.
no, I filed a report. Everything is fine. I am fine.
okay. You left me no choice.
I'm relieving you of your duty. Wh... what?
you heard me, officer. I'm relieving you of duty.
gun and badge on the desk, please.
no. Dan, I really don't think you can do that.
yeah... no, that's not gonna happen.
okay, I'll tell you what is happening.
I'm gonna make this my personal mission...
to track down this peeping Tom.
come on, Jack-o. We're on the case.
no, it's... Damn it, it's not a case!
dripping wet.
Pat...Pat...Pat.
your skin feels alive. The air is cool.
the gooseflesh is coming.
okay, how is this helpful?
you would be surprised how often this works.
then you step over toward the window...
okay, now I'm confused here. Where's the towel?
I mean, are we talking headlights, or was he able to check under the hood? Okay, we're done here.
Hey, you want to catch a perv, you got to think like a perv.
all right, I-I barely saw anything. I was exhausted.
I had just come back from yoga.
yoga! Yes, yoga class!
of course!
this sicko scouts out yoga classes... Where... where young women with hard bodies...
go to expand their spirits... and to tighten their righteous glutes...
and whatnot.
he watches them bend.
he watches them fold. He watches them sweat.
and then he follows them home.
and he watches them shower.
actually, that's plausible.
Namaste.
I'm Detective Dan Stark.
I'm here to talk to you about a dangerous sexual predator... who's on the loose.
that's right... a peeper.
a depraved horndog... who is a threat to each and every one of you.
my partner, Jack Bailey, is handing you all a perv whistle.
uh, safety whistle.
I want you each to keep your perv whistles with you at all times. Why?
take a look at yourselves.
you all possess sexy...
lithe, incredibly flexible bodies.
make you all prime peeping targets.
that's right.
like you, darling... I mean, you can't go sporting a silhouette like that...
without taking some precautions.
there you go.
Hey, you know what, studly?
I'm even gonna give one to you.
I feel safer already. Do not fear!
I will personally be on patrol...
all night long in your neighborhood.
that's right. When the sun goes down, I will be right outside that window, watching...
...for that peeping Tom. - Uh...
Hey, uh, Dan, could I have a word?
Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Don't let me stop you.
Hey, you think I'm getting through to them?
Yeah, I think all of the blinds are gonna be shut tonight.
well, that's a start.
listen, I know that Ruiz is the real victim here, so I'm just concerned that you may be taking this... a little too personally.
no such thing as taking a case too personally.
well, no, it's just if you're too close, it could cloud your judgment.
Oh, bull diddley.
a man always does his best work when he's too invested, and I'm way too invested.
and bad guys better watch out.
relax, Wallace.
DRAYTON.HEADQUARTERS OFF.EL
now, how about you boys telling me what you found?
the six pages contained in the file before you, if made public, could bring this company to its knees.
it's a safety report.
not any safety report.
that is the blackbird file.
it was buried by the company six years ago.
incredibly sensitive material, so, naturally, I brought it to you.
Where'd you find this little gem?
I found it encrypted and deleted... on a discarded hard drive.
somebody tried really hard to make sure that was gone.
we see evidence that drayton oil... "and its owner, Patrick drayton, "have been knowingly profiting... from unsafe and illegal drilling practices.
yet somehow that never saw the light of day.
you have a hand in this, ashford?
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Look.
this thing never came through my office.
I've never seen that report in my life.
I say we take it to the feds. Then what?
company goes down in flames, we lose our jobs.
in this economy? A-and good luck getting another gig... once we're known as a bunch of whistle-blowers.
but it's a safety report.
we know about it. We're liable.
people get hurt, it could bite us in the ass.
I'm all for doing the right thing.
but I need this job. Screw this job!
I can't even get an hour lunch break... out of these cheap corporate bastards.
I am not giving up my career...
so some loser computer tech... can live out his revenge fantasy.
hold on, hold on. I've got a better idea.
we're gonna sell it.
wait. Isn't that illegal?
this blackbird file gets out, our biggest competitor stands to make millions.
why shouldn't a couple mil land in our pockets?
that should take the sting out of unemployment.
I knew it. I knew it. I knew you'd come up with something great.
take down a corrupt company... and get a little reward for our troubles.
Theo, what do you say?
whatever. I hate this job. I like money. I'm in.
I love doing the right thing.
I went ahead and compiled a map of Ruiz's neighborhood... marked with all the registered sex offenders.
Oh, great.
uh, y-you do know this isn't your job.
Oh, I had a little free time. Okay.
according to the txdps database, within a 3-mile radius, there are 317 creeps officially on record, and I really like your tie.
Oh, uh, thank you.
uh, a-any convicted stalkers, voyeurs?
Nope, so I did a little extra snooping... and cross-referenced that database with two others...
and created the matrix of sexual deviancy.
you don't have to call it that.
actually, let's not call it that. - Hey.
Hey! Hey, you!
sorry. I...
we don't know each other that well.
I just got caught up in the moment.
all right, I'm just gonna go.
thank you. - Bye.
so, hey, about dinner tonight...
Kyle got off work early, so he can join us.
uh, ye... well, you know, uh, the thing is, I- I really have a lot of work that I ought to get to.
I just keep thinking to myself, you know, you and Kyle, you'd probably really get along...
if... if you just spent some time together.
you haven't really had a chance.
well, maybe some other time.
my evening is gonna be packed with sexual deviancy.
I'm just gonna go ahead... and assume that makes sense in another conversation.
all right. Keep moving.
official police business here. Nothing to see.
peeping Tom on the loose.
now, what have we here?
hello.
well, now. We're getting kinky.
what?
No! Stop!
stop! Police!
Jack! This is bigger than a peeping Tom!
we got a murderin' Jane!
industrial grade, polyethylene tarp, vapor tape, no sign of a forced entry, and a single bullet wound... to the head with a silencer.
Dan, this is a professional hit.
Yeah, or one hell of a kink fest.
I mean, if you hadn't interrupted the killer, there wouldn't be a shred of evidence.
now, did you get a good look at her?
no, not good enough, but...
I can't emphasize to you enough... how attractive she was.
I mean, just big, ol' pouty lips...
not me.
dead guy.
wait. I'm gonna answer it.
what are you gonna say?
I'm gonna imitate the guy's voice.
I'm good at doing impressions.
you can't imitate his voice. You didn't even hear him talk.
Hello?
Hey, Theo. I-I've been having second thoughts.
if they realize we took that file, we all could be dead.
we never should have stolen that file.
stolen that file.
w- who did we steal the file from?
Theo?
Yeah. Theo.
w- what's wrong with your voice, Theo?
nothin'. Who is this? Who are you?
who's this? Who are you?!
G...
I think he caught on.
you think? I tell you what, Jack-o.
these guys are in over their head.
I don't think they even know it yet.
Hey, buddy.
what part of "keeping our contact to a minimum..."
do you not understand?
somebody's onto us.
they've got Theo's phone.
what are you talking about?
I called Theo. It wasn't Theo.
it was, like, some low-voiced freak.
look, pull yourself together, man.
Theo was probably... just stoned out of his mind playing video games.
I bet he was just messing with you.
maybe. Maybe.
now, we stick to my plan, all right?
the day after tomorrow, I'm gonna sell the blackbird file, and then what do we do?
we stay out of town until things cool down.
exactly. Get yourself to a beach, buddy.
get a tan. Please.
okay. You'll... you'll... You'll check on Theo?
if it'll make you happy, absolutely.
I assure you there won't be any more surprises.
Hey, babe.
what are you doing here?
I'm coming to get you. You ready to go?
Yes. In five minutes.
uh, by the way, Jack is not coming...
it's just you and me tonight.
well, that's too bad.
so, I had an interesting day at work today.
and what do we have here?
open it up.
first class to a tropical island... in the middle of nowhere.
what do you say we disappear for a couple weeks?
white, Sandy beach?
the flight leaves in two days.
there's no way I can drop everything.
come on, sweets. We need this.
no, it's impossible. Look at my desk.
come on. You can't say no.
look, when an opportunity like this comes along, you just have to reach out, and you got to grab it.
all right.
I'm gonna rearrange my schedule.
good. Do it.
we both could use the time alone... together, without any distractions.
good morning, neighbor.
Dan. What the hell are you doing here?
well, in light of recent murderous activity... in your neighborhood, I took it upon myself...
to park the aluminum love cradle close to your house... so I could keep watch over you during the night.
it's the least I can do as your bodyguard.
no, no, no, no, no. No.
you are not my bodyguard. I do not need a bodyguard.
I understand you're upset, but let's talk about it... while izzy and I escort you to your vehicle.
no, that's not gonna happen, okay, because we are investigating a murder...
that has happened in my neighborhood, and I'm not gonna let you and this thing that you live in...
get in my way.
you're strong, and you know I dig that.
but I want you to take this. Please?
take it with you. It's a whistle.
keep it with you at all times.
so if you encounter somebody... who's making you uncomfortable and invading...
...your personal space...
I guess I should have expected that.
I'm not a helpless victim, Dan. I'm a police lieutenant.
now go get me a lead on that murder case!
lieu, can you tell me where the water main is?
cause, uh, I got to hook up the plumbing.
I got a... I got a situation in my bathroom here.
you know what? Don't worry about it.
don't worry about it. I'll figure it out.
this is Detective Jack Bailey... with the Dallas police department.
I need a trace on a blocked ca...
no, yeah, sure. I'll hold again. Why not?
I mean, it's only a murder investigation!
there's an easier way... to get your caller's name and address. How?
here is your caller's name and address.
Oh. That was easy.
I traced it myself.
we're working with the phone company on another case, and I've become familiar with their procedures.
and their passwords.
I really hope I'm not taking away... any of the fun, detective-y part of your job.
no. This is, uh...
this is good. Thank you.
have no fear.
ana has been safely escorted to her office un-ogled.
that's incredibly comforting.
okay, where are we on our murder case?
we need what Frank used to call a lead.
Yeah, everybody calls it a lead.
you got one? Yeah.
thanks to Samantha.
Yeah, thanks to me.
Scott Wallace.
all right? He's our mystery caller.
got an address right there.
nice work. Let's get over there before it's too late.
Scott WALLACE'S CONDO
Scott WALLACE'S CONDO IT'S TOO LATE
Hello?
I want my money back. You're a disaster.
relax. Everything is under control.
under control? I paid for a corporate cleaning.
not a giant mess.
I thought you were gonna try and buy him off first.
the hacker was unreliable.
the cleanest solution was to eliminate him.
besides, he was a loser. No one would have even noticed he was missing.
well, somebody noticed! You left a body and a witness!
that was a fluke.
look, you hired me for my reputation because I'm the best.
the situation is under control.
this time, no one will even notice a crime was comm...
Mr. Wallace?!
I want this...
Mr. Wallace! Dallas p. D! Your front door was open!
Mr. Wallace?
Mr. Wallace!
Hey.
Hey, wake up, buddy.
wake up.
it's a suicide.
hang on.
he's gone.
Oh, you never get used to it, Jack-o...
being around a dead body.
zombie! Shoot him in the head! It's the only way!
stop! Stop, Dan!
he's trying to say something. He's trying to talk. He's what?!
what? What?
Drayton...Oil... What?
...trying to kill me.
was it a woman? Was it a hot woman?
Dan. Shh!
blackbird.
stay with us!
stay with me, brother! You're gonna be fine!
this is Detective Jack Bailey.
I need an ambulance right away!
do not go into the light! Do not go into the light! You've got to be kidding me.
h- hey... let me see...
uh, can you make those... M- make the lips bigger.
luscious and pouty... Pouty lips.
and put her in some kind of hot, little, uh, nurse's outfit.
well, yeah, was she wearing a nurse's outfit? No.
just trust me on this.
put her in a nurse's outfit. Something short.
well, we have a murderer in my neighborhood, and our only witness is in critical condition.
so please tell me we've got something else.
Yeah, uh, from what I've learned, blackbird is an independent safety report... on the oil industry.
it comes out every five years or so.
a lot of companies fell in its crosshairs, with the exception of Drayton oil.
for some reason, their report came back squeaky-clean.
why would somebody be murdered over a positive safety report?
exactly. I mean, it's got to be a- a lie or a cover-up, maybe?
well, what the hell are we waiting for?
let's get over there, kick some doors down at that company, see if anyone recognizes our murderin' Jane.
Ooh, man. Smokin'. Ooh. Yeah.
okay, wait. Hold on.
the C. E.O. Patrick Drayton, is one of the most powerful businessmen in Dallas.
I mean, if he's involved, we need to learn more before we show our hand.
so, how do we do that?
we need someone on the inside.
and I know just the guy.
I. T. Department.
Theo, please.
Oh, you didn't hear, man? Theo was murdered.
what? What are you saying?
Yeah, it happened last night.
I guess they found his body in his house, and he'd been shot.
Krista, get in here!
is everything okay?
Yes. I need to see Mr. Wallace in my office.
now. Oh, you didn't hear.
Mr. Wallace tried to commit suicide last night.
what? I know. Pills.
Rhindi heard he was in a coma.
I knew he had that, like, divorce or whatever, but that was like months ago.
clear my schedule! Cancel everything!
okay.
and what should I tell the two cops who are here to see you?
cops?
Jack! Hey. Good to see you.
uh, this is my partner, Dan stark. How you doin'?
what are you talking about? He's not bad-looking.
what? Uh, Kyle, listen.
I- I know that we haven't always been on the same page, but, uh, I was wondering if you could help us out.
of course. Of course, man. What, uh... what do you need?
you just name it, buddy. Name it.
do you know anything about a blackbird file?
No! I mean, uh, nope. No, I haven't.
here's the deal... Your boss, Drayton, he knows all about this blackbird file, so we need to get some face time with the chief hombre.
Mr. Drayton is... Is very busy.
well, maybe you can talk with him about the blackbird file.
I mean, it's early in the investigation, so if you would please not mention the police, it would...
are you okay?
Absolutely.
never better.
in fact, why don't we go back to my office, and, uh, I'll check Mr. Drayton's schedule.
cool.
all right! We're moving.
I got it. Thank you.
sure. Be right back.
just, uh, make yourselves comfortable.
damn it!
I'm taking a mulligan. She's distracting me.
here.
I want you to pay a visit to a golf buddy of mine.
his name's marshal Hewitt.
the C. E.O. of Hewitt petroleum? Exactly.
I saw him in the pro shop. He smiled at me.
the bastard never smiles at me.
I think he knows something...
about my little... Business problem.
think he's trying to acquire the file from one of your employees?
figure it out.
clean it up.
that's your job.
Oh. My bad.
is it just me, or does Kyle seem...
distracted, you know, suspicious?
well, he sure didn't want to be talking to you, that's for sure.
right? Yeah.
you think it might be because he knows that you know... that he's curling your true love's toes?
no, I don't think that's it.
it's just, uh, something doesn't feel right.
I mean, it's been 25 minutes. Where the hell is he?
you think that smarmy little lawyer knows something?
I think it's time to find out.
let's roll.
excuse me.
Where's Kyle?
Oh, um, Mr. Ashford actually left for the day.
What?! He told us to wait in his office.
we're sitting in there, kicking carp... come on.
Yeah. Hewitt.
Yes, uh, I have the, um...
Bird-related document that we previously discussed.
the fee that we agreed upon? Yeah.
okay, I'm at the location right now, all right?
I want this stupid thing out of my life. When can you get here?
soon.
uh, I'm sending my, uh, a-associate... to make the exchange. I don't care about the details.
just make sure they're here fast and tell them to bring the cash.
Kyle! Come out! Now!
okay. Doesn't look like he's here.
Yeah, we'll see about that. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on, now.
I think you may be a-a little too close... to this thing, personally.
too close? Yeah.
I distinctly recall you telling me... a good cop should take every case too personally.
true, but I neglected to inform you... there... there's an exception clause.
Oh, an exception clause. Yeah.
it's called the "if you do this, Liz will never sleep with you again" clause.
okay, you're gonna look like a jealous lunatic... if you kick this in. Okay. I am not jealous.
Kyle is hiding something.
I know it. And you know it. Now, move.
Oh, don't... Don't get me wrong.
now, being too close personally, it helps when you're busting punks, but it does not go over so well with the ladies.
you care for Lizzie.
I'm not gonna stand here and watch you ruin that.
now, if this is our guy, we'll find another way to bust him, okay?
Kyle is a criminal, and I'm gonna prove it.
not because I'm jealous. But because I'm a cop.
take a look at this.
what you got there?
Liz's toothbrush is here.
her clothes are here. Her work is here.
she's practically living here, Dan! L-let's just focus...
on the kyle/blackbird angle of it all, okay? Oh, God.
you know, I knew that she was, you know, talking about moving in with this slimeball, but I didn't know that it was so...Serious.
Jack, only pain comes from this. I mean, take it from me.
I've searched the houses of countless boyfriends... of former lady loves of mine.
what is that?!
this is mine!
Dan, this is mine!
that sow's got a corkscrew tail.
that's cute. I like that.
we got it, uh, when we went... on an awesome wine-tasting trip.
it was one of our first dates.
you know what... Kyle is just gonna have to find...
some other way to open up his fancy wines... because I am taking Corky back.
Corky"? We named it corky.
okay, Jack, you've compiled enough evidence... to convict Kyle in any court across the land...
of having repetitive sexual contact... with your lady love, okay?
he's guilty. Let's move on.
let's go talk to the C. E.O. of this oil company.
Ruiz got me the address of his country club.
that's a good idea. You go that way.
I'm gonna check out what's on Kyle's computer.
No! Jack-o! Jack! Do not do that.
look, I-I may not know much about computers, but there's one thing I do know.
there are pictures on that machine... of Kyle and Lizzie in Flagrante.
you don't know that.
never underestimate a man's need... to photograph his sexual conquests, Jack.
get to the point.
this is what I'm gonna offer you.
I will view these photos for you privately.
no, you can't look at the photos, 'cause there are no photos, Dan!
so just go, all right? Go talk to the C. E.O. okay?
taking it too personally! What about you, Dan?!
I mean, you parked your trailer... in front of the lieutenant's house, claiming to be her own personal bodyguard.
what's going on with your own personal, inappropriate case?
you know what? Don't worry about that.
I got that covered.
l. T! Welcome home.
Julius, what are you doing here at my home?
d- detective Dan told me about the sexual peeper dude... that you got all up in your neighborhood.
he was like, "hey, you want to take a couple shifts?" I'm like, "yeah.
wait, wait, wait. Some shifts of what?
Oh, uh, bodyguarding.
Yeah, no. Defending your honor.
you know, providing vigilance 24/7... to protect you from criminal activity.
Julius, is that my apron?
uh, yes. Yes, it is. And you know what?
you should get a better lock for your back window.
I'm gonna kill him. You know what?
I'm gonna just do yours medium-rare.
is that... okay. Yeah.
I- it's good to have protection, l. T. 'cause even good neighborhoods can be unsafe.
Liz. Hi.
where are you?
nowhere, you know.
just working, just following a lead.
that's funny 'cause...
looks to me like you're sitting at Kyle's desk...
for God only knows what reason.
I can explain.
I think you'd better.
yesterday an executive at Kyle's company was attacked.
okay, now, it was a professional hit, and the victim said that the killer worked for drayton oil.
okay, skip to the part where you break into my house, Jack.
your house?
Kyle's house. Are you happy? Does it matter?
Yes, it matters. It matters a lot.
well, so you... So you moved in with him.
don't change the subject.
Dan and I went to go ask Kyle a few questions.
and he ran, all right? He was acting suspicious.
are you insinuating that Kyle's somehow involved in this?
well, he wasn't acting like an innocent person would.
Oh, my God. My God. I knew it!
you have never wanted to give Kyle a chance.
you've been gunning for him... since before you even met him, Jack!
that is not what this is about.
Hey, um, on your way over here, did you happen to pick up, um, uh, what's that...
a search warrant?
I'm only asking you... because I'm assistant district attorney.
look at these e-mails, okay?
correspondence with the two victims.
from his co-workers. Okay.
he has plane tickets, Liz. He's skipping the country.
those are tickets to our vacation, Jack.
why are you even looking at those?
to the maldive islands, okay?
a place that has no extradition treaty... with the United States.
coincidence?
why are you doing this, Jack?
because I'm a cop. I want to know why Kyle ashford ran the second he saw me.
maybe because he thinks he's being framed... by my crazy, jealous ex-boyfriend.
okay, Liz, I'm gonna say this as simply as I can.
I believe your boyfriend stole something from his company...
and that someone is trying to kill him to get it back.
well... I'm calling Kyle.
great. Call him. I've been trying... to get him on the phone all day, but he won't take my call.
well, he'll talk to me.
Hey, babe. Can't talk.
I'm about to jump into a meeting.
Hey, are you okay?
uh, yeah. Of course.
listen, this is crazy.
Jack is telling me that I need to warn you about some woman, a hit man, a-a hit woman, if you will.
she's got, uh, blond hair. I guess she's tall.
she's...
sexy lips.
he seems to think that this hit woman, uh, tried to kill one of your co-workers earlier... and that you are next on her list.
got to run, babe. Be home soon.
what did he say?
he's on his way home.
you can ask him yourself.
great.
may I have a word with you, your wealthiness?
this is a private club. Members only.
Oh, really? It's a good thing that I got me a day pass.
well, I've got me a tee time.
so whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait... until after my round.
you can call my lawyer. I've done nothing wrong.
you know, in my experience, golfers are bullies and cowards.
it's something about the... the... the club...
being so darn big... and the balls being so darn small.
call Marcus in security, please.
Yeah, do that.
while we're waiting, uh, Do you recognize... Her?
never seen that woman before in my life.
are you sure, now? You want to take another look?
she's quite an exquisite creature.
wish I could help you. I really do. Yeah.
you know anything about the blackbird file?
holy... well, I'll take that as a "yes.
get out of my clubhouse. Where's Marcus?
you, sir... You have devoted your life... to a wussy sport which you will never master.
and you're a terrible liar.
you revealed yourself to me.
you can expect to hear from my attorney.
Oh, hey.
okay. All right.
someone must have tipped Ashford off.
he got away. You're fired!
he tried to kill me.
you have any proof?
Jack, he's obviously not the bad guy here.
have you seen his car? It is riddled with bullet holes.
it's riddled with bullet holes, Jack, and someone kicked in my front door.
that was me, actually.
okay, I don't know what's going on here, all right?
I'm just... I'm trying to do the right thing.
okay, well, w-why didn't you take it to Liz?
I mean, she works for the D. A.
well, the other two people who know about the file... are either dead or in the hospital.
I'm not gonna put other people's lives in danger.
especially Liz's.
I'm sure you'd do the same thing.
Jack, I'd feel much better... if we could get him under police protection.
fine, I'll take you into custody... until we can sort this whole thing out.
thank you, buddy. In the meantime, I'm gonna need that blackbird file.
Absolutely.
I- I don't have it on me. I hid it.
well, then, you're gonna take me to where you hid it.
Oh, my God. Okay.
if you cook like that, you can break into my house any day.
well, thank you.
thank you very much. You know what?
I- I wanted to do dessert, but I didn't find any in there.
would you mind if I broke into one of these houses... and got, like, an apple pie?
no, we have enough crime in this neighborhood... with our peeping Tom and our murderer.
don't even worry about it. Y'all will catch him eventually.
y'all always caught me.
Yeah, well, I'll drink to that. Hmm.
hmm. Yes.
may I use your facilities?
absolutely, and you can even go... through the front door like a non-criminal.
Ah, you know, I would use the, um...
but Dan hasn't hooked up the plumbing, so it's... it's just kind of gathering.
okay, o-okay. I got it. I got it. Thank you. Right. That's too much.
you're right. Be right back.
that's him! That's the peep... He peeped all over me!
you're a long way from your yoga mat.
missed you in class today.
Oh, geez. D-did he try to get rough with you?
did you use your whistle?
I mean, I can't believe I wasn't there for you.
well, somehow I muddled through.
well, the least I can do is give you your command back.
Hey, listen up, everybody! No.
important announcement here.
lieutenant Ruiz is back in charge.
let's give her a round of applause. Dan, I was always in ch...
Oh, thanks.
okay, that's it. Let's fight some crime. Party's over. Thanks.
all right. That's good.
listen, now that that's taken care of, can you please just give Jack a hand?
he's got a big break in the blackbird case.
Yeah, I don't think Jack's really in the mood... to have me looking over his shoulder right now.
when have you ever taken "no" for an answer?
okay, look. I- I got to confess. I...
I've pretty much been deliberately avoiding... getting to know you.
Really? Yeah.
but, um, you know, now that I know... that you're just trying to do the right thing,
I feel kind of bad.
well, to be fair, I wasn't exactly... champing at the bit to hang out with you, either.
Really?
hell, no, man. When you bailed on dinner, I was thrilled.
huh. So all this time I've been avoiding you, you've been avoiding me.
Oh, yeah. Definitely.
and I thought we didn't have anything in common.
Hey, Jack around?
Oh, he and Kyle went... to pick up the blackbird file from his ranch.
Kyle's ranch.
not Jack's ranch. I don't think Jack has a ranch.
Hey, do you need another sketch done?
because I could put her in a leather cat suit this time.
I like the way you think, darling, but, no, no, no.
your first sketch worked like a charm.
I mean, any innocent man... would have taken one look at that drawing...
and started studying the curves... and asking about the sexy outfit and whatnot.
Drayton didn't give it a second thought.
our murderer may be a woman, but Drayton is definitely pulling the strings, and I'm gonna take him down before he strikes again.
that reminds me. Uh, Mr. Wallace is dead.
What?! He was killed in the hospital this morning.
two HOURS EARLIER
Kyle's got to be the next target, and Jack's out there on the ranch with him?
please tell me he took backup.
I think they went alone.
Oh, damn it!
Ah, don't worry. The maid will get it.
come on in.
so, you played quarterback.
Oh, yeah. High School.
gave it up when I went to Yale, though.
so, the blackbird file's over in the family safe.
this will just take a second.
let's see.
do you mind, buddy?
fine.
I'll be in the east wing.
yeah?
what the hell you doing out there... with a murderin' Jane on the loose?!
and Wallace... I'm fine. Wait. Slow down.
they got to Wallace! He's dead!
really dead this time.
Kyle is next. Jack, you need backup.
N- no, Dan. I'm fine.
I'm just here to get the file, and then I'm gonna go back to the station.
everything's gonna be fine.
Hey, Ashford.
W... this isn't what it looks like.
you're fired.
everything's gonna be fine.
no, Jack!
police! Drop it!
he shot my arm! I was aiming for your heart.
damn, maybe my stance is off.
I'm really bleeding here!
barely!
just lower your weapon. You first!
listen. We can make this work for us.
you tried to sell the blackbird file to the highest bidder.
now you want to cut a deal?
I... I knew it.
shut up, Jack! Look, hey.
nobody knows about this except him.
so you're saying we kill him, and all of this could just go away.
Hey, your words, not mine.
drop it, Drayton, all right? This is over!
guns down. I mean it, gentlemen.
what are you doing here?! I thought I told you to get lost!
I'm not about to let my record get tainted... by one dissatisfied customer and a few lucky cops.
get him up. We're moving this in the kitchen.
no. I'm not stepping foot on linoleum.
if you're gonna kill us, you got to kill us somewhere difficult to clean.
have it your way.
36 seconds earlier
if you're gonna kill us, you got to kill us somewhere difficult to clean.
have it your way.
Fore!
now, that's a sport!
Kyle! Kyle, a little help, buddy!
you all right, there, partner?
Yeah. Thanks for the whistle.
I got the blackbird file.
I got the murdering Jane.
Where's Kyle?
did we get them?
they're buying this whole whistle-blower story.
unbelievable.
I don't get it. That twerp should be going to jail.
it's like they're planning a ticker-tape parade.
what are we gonna do?
we don't have a case. We don't have any proof.
even Liz believes him. I'm telling you, man.
I got a half a mind to wander over there... and punch that twerp in the kisser.
no, you were right, Dan.
the second I went after Kyle...
I lost Liz either way.
Hey, buddy.
I just wanted to stop by and say... No hard feelings.
look, Kyle, you can tell them whatever you want, but we both know what really happened.
what are you talking about?
I told your fellow detectives the truth.
I...
face it, Jack.
it's your word against mine.
now, who are they gonna believe?
an upstanding whistle-blower... Or some pathetic ex-boyfriend...
who kicked my door down without a warrant?
is this really something... that you want to drag into a court case?
what would Liz think?
whistle-blower.
Whistle-blower!
Ow! That really hurt!
no, no, okay, there's no other way to explain it, but all of a sudden I hear this, like, shriek.
wait, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.
there's plenty of other ways to describe it.
like a manly yelp. - No, it wasn't...
Yeah, it was a shriek, okay?
and so, then the peeper comes jumping over the fence...
okay, and then you come in...
Hey, she comes in, and she sacks this dude...
like a linebacker, okay?
it was just like... bam! It was brutal.
okay, he had it coming.
I tell you this much, Dan. She doesn't need a bodyguard.
she got moves like, linebacker, heisman trophy.
Yeah, I know. I didn't want anybody to hurt you.
well, I'm touched, but do me a favor, sweetheart, and move this giant beer can out of here by tomorrow, or I'm gonna show you some moves he's talking about.
Hey, I thought you would be halfway... to the maldive islands about now.
plans changed.
what happened?
I don't know what happened at the ranch.
you'll have to tell me.
but I do know you, and I know... that you wouldn't be hiding in the closet.
is that what he said? Yes.
amazing.
I just... I couldn't believe when he said that.
I- I thought, "if you're gonna lie to me about that, what else are you lying to me about?..."
and just to make himself look better, too.
and... and I just don't think you would ever do that.
you tell me the truth...
even when it makes me hate your guts.
I've done it many times.
anyway, um, Kyle and I broke up, so...
well...
I'm not very sorry to hear that.
thank you for your honesty.
would you like a beverage?
Yes, I want a drink more than anything right now.
corky, what are you doing here?
corky didn't really want to be with Kyle anymore.
smart pig.
come on.
a friend was welcomed back.
I told them how much better you were doing.
a marriage was on the mend.
I would like to recapture what we once had.
Gaby and Carlos discovered a secret. - You are gettin' sloppy!
and if people start pokin' around, we're done.
and Susan made a request.
you're asking if I'm okay with letting a stripper live with us?
the first thing you need to know about Robin Gallagher was that everyone liked to look at her.
they would stare at her legs...
and her breasts...
and her hair.
and once they were done, people would begin to ask...
who is this? - This is my friend Robin.
hello there. - Mike had to work today, - so I thought I'd bring her as my plus one. - Hello there.
you already said that.
I wanted her to know I meant it.
it's really good to have you back on the lane, Katherine.
it's great to be back. I didn't know what to expect at first. I have wondered how everyone would feel about me, if they were really ready to welcome me back. I guess there's always that fear that people are going to reject you.
do I smell appetizers? - I know I do.
Hello, Susan!
who's your new friend?
Robin, this is Carlos, Tom, Roy and Orson.
hope you got all that, 'cause there's gonna be a quiz later.
Oh, god.
so, Robin, welcome to my humble abode.
thank you.
it's so suburban.
I've never been in a place where the ceilings were so tall.
fascinating. Just fascinating.
you live in the city?
I did, but I'll be living with Susan for a while.
I just moved in today.
Susan, let's get you a drink.
Oh, no, that's okay. I'll wait till... Oh!
so...
so how did you meet Susan?
so... You want to tell us about your new friend or, uh, should I say "roommate"?
she was down on her luck and she needed a place to stay.
Plus, I feel responsible, - because I told her to give up her job. - What was wrong with her job?
well... we probably don't need to let the guys in on this, - but... Robin was... - That's wild!
so you used to be a stripper?
yes...
everyone liked to look at Robin Gallagher...
but not everyone liked what they saw.
later, while the men of Wisteria Lane were trying the shrimp, their wives were trying to control themselves.
you moved a stripper into the neighborhood?
what were you thinking? - You guys aren't even taking the time to get to know her.
our husbands are in there pooling together - their dollar bills. What more do we need to know? - I just met Robin. She seems great.
did she mention that she's a stripper?
did she have to?
look, I am just trying to help her get back on her feet.
I bet that'd be a nice change for her. - She is living in my house.
if anybody should be worried, it'd be me, and I am not threatened by her at all.
Really?
Yes. She's a nice girl.
Yeah, nice, blonde, and you can bounce a quarter off her ass.
I'm telling you, she's trouble. - Here's a good thing...
she can't bring any more crazy to this street than I did.
let's give her a chance. - I agree.
Robin's probably had a tough life, and she needs our help. - Well, I'm all for being open-minded, but I have teenage boys at home.
the last thing I need next door is a stripper.
Hey, Mrs. Scavo. We're picking up Parker for school.
please come in. I'll get him for you.
so you ever gonna get back to folding the laundry?
well, I thought I'd treat myself and wash the breakfast dishes first.
well, you started this. Don't you think you should finish?
well, since you're so passionate about it...
knock yourself out.
okay, you just went from jerk to adorable real quick.
happy anniversary.
Oh! Mm. Mm.
Mmm. Mmm.
it's the ring!
Oh, you went back to that antique shop.
Yep.
Oh, thank you! Mwah.
wait till you see your present.
you can unwrap it tonight when the kids are asleep.
or how about after they leave for school?
okay.
Hey, why are they still up there and why can't I hear them?
Hey, boys.
what's going on?
uh, we're late for school.
Oh!
Oh, hey, Lynette.
Hi. The next time you take a shower, do you think you could close your blinds?
I have a 16-year-old son, and he has friends.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes. You may have retired from the strip club, but you're still doing seven shows a week.
I mean, at least they didn't have to pay a cover charge, right?
this is a nice community.
you have a responsibility to the neighbors, especially the ones with innocent children.
well, they're not all so innocent.
excuse me?
yesterday that son of yours asked me if I would have sex with him.
Parker?
my Parker?
red hair, skinny, still-sleeps-in-a-bed-shaped-like-a-racecar Parker?
of course I said no.
then he offered me cash.
Hey.
come in.
have a seat.
what's up?
something wrong?
we hoped it would be another year before we had the parent-son conversation where we tell you not to offer your neighbor money for sex.
but...
Oh, crap. She told?
Yeah.
you might want to pick a more discreet stripper next time.
what were you thinking?
we raised you better than that. Didn't we? - Yeah, we did.
we did. So... what do you have to say for yourself?
I just really, really, really...
needed to have sex.
three "reallys." well, in that case,
here's a $20. Go back and try again.
you are a 16-year-old boy.
we understand your hormones are holding your brain hostage, but why would you think you would need to pay for sex?
because I'm the only one of my friends - who hasn't lost his virginity. - Oh. First of all, we've seen your friends, and trust me, "pimples," "braces
and "beam me up, Scotty" are not gettin' any.
girls don't look at me that way.
it's never gonna happen.
Hey.
knock it off!
you are a great kid!
you don't need to pay for it.
in a few years, when you're emotionally ready,
you'll meet the right girl, and you will have tons of sex.
after you're married.
okay, Dad.
sorry.
nice job.
thank you.
you think he bought it?
bought what?
you know.
Mnh-mnh.
guys always pay for sex in some way...
I mean, dinner, flowers...
antique rings.
whoa. Whoa.
you think that's the only reason we're having sex tonight?
of course not. It's our anniversary.
it's a given, like turkey on thanksgiving.
although I am hoping that the ring gets me an upgrade from missionary.
forget about upgrades. You just got bumped off the flight.
honey, wh... why are you getting so upset?
because I didn't know I was married to such a cynical lug nut.
wait. Are we really not gonna have sex tonight?
don't worry, Tom.
in a few years, when you're emotionally ready, you're gonna have tons of sex.
come on!
so you really like that ring?
Yep.
Mm-hmm.
do you read the inscription? "To my darling..."
we're not having sex, Tom.
Oh, come on. Why not?
because I am still upset by what you said.
do you really think women only sleep with men if they buy them things?
no. I think supermodels sleep with 80-year-old millionaires because they love to hear stories about when bread was 5 cents a loaf.
well, I'm not a model, and you're no millionaire, so I'm thinking you owe me an apology.
you and I went to Marley's Tavern on our first two dates, and I could barely get past a good night kiss.
but third time out, I dropped 200 bucks at La Rive Gauche, and bam! You finally put out.
finally made love.
listen, you idiot!
I did not "put out" because you bought me an expensive dinner.
I did it because you showed up for the date with a lightbulb to replace the one that had burned out in the hallway to my apartment. Remember?
Oh. - You said I didn't live in the best neighborhood.
and I was worried about you.
bingo. I was ready to do you right then and there.
Really?
that's all it takes?
me showing you I care?
cause that's easy.
and now it's time for your anniversary present.
Whoo!
Hey, Robin.
remember the other day when I told you this was a nice neighborhood?
I forgot to warn you...
there's this one bitch that lives right nearby, and that would be me.
look, I understand.
an ex-stripper moving next door will freak some people out.
no. Seriously, I'm sorry.
apology accepted.
Oh, and, uh, by the way...
Oh. Yeah?
the next time you're giving it to your husband with the lights on, could you draw the drapes?
here we go.
well, I've got the, uh, Steiner bar mitzvah tomorrow.
do you need me to run any errands for you before I go?
no, I should be good.
Joyce will be here at 3: 00 for my rehab, and Roy offered to take me to the park.
Oh. Well, isn't that lovely?
do you wanna watch a movie? - Well, I guess I'll read...
I guess we could watch a movie.
no. No, no. If you want to read, go ahead.
well...
good night.
if you need anything, just ring the bell. I'm...
right upstairs.
I... I'm sure I'll be fine.
knock, knock.
Robin. Come on in.
can I ask you a favor? - Sure.
Susan and Mike have been so good to me.
I wanna do something nice for them, and I thought, hey, maybe I should bake them a cake.
Oh, that's very thoughtful.
well, feel free to use whatever you need.
thank you.
so what do I need?
Robin, what exactly do you know about cakes?
well, I know that if you're gonna hide them one for more than an hour,
the air holes have got to be pretty big.
all right, then.
it looks like I will be teaching you how to make a cake.
Oh, yay! You rock, Bree!
I rock.
now the key to success is following the recipe exactly.
the secret to baking is precision.
got it. You're my hero.
what are you doing? - Making you my screensaver.
Oh, that's sweet.
you're replacing my cat. He's eating noodles.
let's just do this.
okay.
go get yourself an apron.
that is, like, the coolest cake I've ever seen.
raspberry mocha.
Orson's favorite.
I talked to him at the party. He's nice.
it must be tough having him in a wheelchair.
it's been challenging.
well, they say you can get through anything if you have a solid marriage.
Yes, well...
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
it's fine.
let's just say before his accident there were issues, and now we're trying to put the pieces back together.
well, that's good for you.
so what's the piece you can't find?
Ah! Now you are prying.
what?
we did make a cake together.
look, my grandmother always said that if you wanna save your marriage, there's only one room to do it in.
the bedroom.
Yeah, I got that.
it's not about sex.
it's about... closeness.
we've lost our intimacy.
Oh. Honey.
sex is how men get intimate.
well, I'm not even sure he's capable.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
his brain still works.
and he can see you. He can feel you touch him.
he can hear what you say to him.
you know, I had this regular customer...
92 years old, in a wheelchair.
I used to have to push the oxygen tank out of the way to give him a lap dance.
I don't know if he's even interested.
well, here's the thing.
neither of us knows for sure, but only one of us can find out.
Hello, dear.
how was the bar mitzvah? - A boy became a man, and a rabbi blessed my cream puffs.
same old, same old. How was your day?
Oh, I've been passing the time reading.
well, I suppose I should get out of these cloth.
Oh! Peter Tchaikovsky. God bless you.
Yes. I never tire of this piece.
it's extraordinary... so moving, so...
sensual.
don't you wanna do that upstairs?
you know, near the hamper.
actually, I'd rather do it...
right...
here.
why are you walking like that?
why do you think?
I'm not sure.
you're trying to make me feel better about being paralyzed?
guess again, big boy.
well, if you're having a stroke, we're gonna make quite the team.
Oh!
I do believe it's getting...
hot in here.
are you all right?
Yeah. Just a second. My earring's caught.
enjoy the music.
Oh, let me help.
no, no, no. I'm good. - Stay there. I'm coming over.
no, Orson, I've got it.
Ow!
Ow!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I told you I didn't need any help!
well, in my defense, that wasn't entirely clear.
forget it. This was stupid.
what was that?
what do you think?! It was a lap dance!
that was a lap dance?
I was trying to arouse you.
you are aware I'm in wheelchair? - Well, I thought you still might be interested in that sort of thing. - I am!
well, you certainly don't act like it.
after the accident,
I just never thought you would ever consider...
Oh, Orson.
things will be awkward at first, but we can work on it.
you're my husband.
I wanna be close to you.
I wanna share your bed again, even if it means just holding your hand before you fall asleep.
come here.
is this all right?
let's see...
I've got Tchaikovsky on the stereo, my wife in my arms.
Yes, this is all right.
she and Danny spent the whole day together.
what's left to say?
this is out of control. Let's forbid Ana to talk to him.
Yeah, forbid two teenagers... That always works.
besides, what would we say...
we overheard his parents talking and we think they're evil?
what do you think the Bolens did? - I don't know,
but you don't go on the run for not paying your cable bill.
they've been cagey ever since they moved in.
and Nick doesn't work. How do they have money?
maybe they're drug dealers or gun runners.
whatever they are, I don't want Ana anywhere near that family.
she won't break up with him. - She will if we make her.
I told you that won't work.
we need to come up with a carrot, not a stick.
ana.
privacy, please.
I've got big news. - For me or for you?
you! - Oh.
I just got a call from my good friend Luke Rayfield.
I was a struggling model in New York when he was a struggling photographer. - Mm-hmm.
well, mostly I was his beard for all his family functions.
there was this one time... - Is the part about me coming up?
Oh, yeah.
anyway, Luke now has his own modeling agency,
and he's always looking for new talent,
so I sent him your picture.
wait for it! Wait for it.
he wants to represent you.
you may now begin screaming.
Aah!
Oh, I have to call Danny!
Oh, well, you know what? Danny can wait.
we need to go buy you some new luggage.
they want you in New York immediately.
now? But, uh, don't I have to finish high school?
world War II... Germany lost. Korean War... Korea lost.
vietnam War... we lost. Happy graduation.
what's wrong?
I... I don't think I can go just yet.
why not?
Danny and I have a plan.
we're going to New York together when I graduate.
after everything I've done for her...
Danny and I are moving to New York after I graduate. We're in love!
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!" Ugh!
pour me some more wine before I throw up. - What's wrong?
Oh, Gaby got her niece a foot in the door for a modeling career, - and she's turning it down. - Ooh, bad call.
I used to take ballet, and I was pretty good at it, too.
and one time, this instructor from a big ballet company saw me perform, and... oh, long story short,
two days later they offered me a job.
what happened?
Bobby Butterfield happened.
a boy. - Not just a boy.
the boy.
Oh, I was crazy about him,
thought it was gonna last forever.
so I passed on the job.
and two months later, he dumped me for Louise Mcmullen.
and then a month after that, I got into a car accident,
messed up my knee,
and then it was good-bye, tutu. Hello ta-tas.
Oh.
that is fantastic!
did we just hear the same story?
you have got to tell that story to Ana.
putting off your dreams
and then having your life spiral down the crapper?
it couldn't be more perfect.
well, I... I guess I could talk to Ana, if you think it would help her.
great. And don't be afraid to turn on the waterworks.
nothin' sells pathetic stripper tears.
maybe it would help if I started taping you
so you could hear what it is you say.
don't be discouraged if Luke starts you off with catalogue work.
just try to get your face in the shot.
a little tough to do with a lawn mower, but I did it. - Hey. Ana. Where you been?
I was texting you. - Oh, I was just coming over.
Ooh. Taking a trip?
I'm... sure you two have a lot to talk about.
so I'll just take these inside for you.
Bye, Danny.
what do you need luggage for?
I was just about to come over and tell you right now.
when did this happen? - I just found out, okay?
ana, I thought we were supposed to go together.
why can't you wait? - This is a huge opportunity.
you should be saying, "Great, Ana. Go for it."
if you can't support me,
then maybe we shouldn't even be together.
Hey! Hey, Robin!
Oh, hi. What's up?
I've been meaning to thank you.
you little speech to Ana worked like a charm.
I just took her to the airport. - Great.
Mm... hmm. So, uh, why was she fighting with Danny Bolen yesterday?
they were breaking up.
they were dating?
Yeah. That's the whole reason I wanted you to talk to her, to convince her she was screwing up her life,
so I could ship her off to New York - And get her away from Danny. - You didn't tell me that.
okay. So?
so I don't like being used. - Oh, don't get upset. You did good.
ana's gone. Danny's out of the picture.
I owe ya big time.
Danny.
Hey, I think we need to talk.
sorry. It's really not a good time.
actually, this is exactly the time.
I just talked to Luke.
ana has settled into her dorm,
she's got all her classes lined up, and he's taking her new head shots tomorrow.
and the best part is,
she is miles away from the nearest Bolen.
Oh, perfect timing.
something smells good.
thank you.
just putting on the finishing touches before we eat.
bon appetite.
Oh, you spoil me. - Mm.
Mm! - What's wrong? Is it your back again?
Yeah. I spent all day working in a crawl space.
Aw. I'll call the chiropractor first thing in the morning.
no need for that. I can fix it.
come here. - Ow!
Oh, wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! What are you doin'? - At Double D's, the girls were constantly throwing their backs out from sliding down that pole. They all came to see me.
now just relax, and one, two, three.
there. How do you feel?
Oh, my god. It's gone.
the pain's gone.
Wow! Uh, thank you, Robin.
I... I was just gonna give him a Scotch
and make him sleep the guest room.
seriously, you really fixed me up.
Thanks. - Oh, please.
after all you guys have done for me, it's the least I can do.
I'm home!
in here!
no fast food tonight!
fire up the...
microwave.
Hey. - My back went out again.
Robin tried cracking it, but it just didn't go deep enough.
this is the way the Buddhist monks do it.
it's the only way to get through all that muscle.
is there a problem, babe?
no. No problem.
Mm!
it looks like you're in good hands.
or... Feet.
so I'll just, uh, go make dinner.
happy trails!
how does that feel?
Oh! Yeah, yeah, do that! Do that!
can you handle a little more? - Oh! Give me all you got.
so I, uh, ran into Janice White today.
says her husband is sick.
Oh, wow, you're really stiff.
okay, let me try something else.
Oh, you're the boss.
apparently, it's bacterial, and he's, uh, bloating like a pig.
I'm gonna grab it and pull.
go for it!
and there's a lot of diarrhea!
Oh, yes! Ohh! Yes!
Ohh, yes!
this is incredible.
those monks really know what they're doing.
Oh, yeah.
when do they find time to pray?
Hey! I'm on my way to school.
the faculty volunteered to make sandwiches for the homeless.
okay, well, I'll, uh, see you later.
what's the matter?
I, uh, re... piped an entire house. Even my hair hurts.
Aw, you poor thing. You want the heating pad? - No. No, I'll be okay.
well, I won't be gone long. Feel better.
I'll just have Robin crack my back when she gets home.
or I could stay here and do it.
what about the homeless?
please. They've gone this long without food.
what's another ten minutes?
Susan, do you have a problem with Robin working on me?
of course not.
but she's not here, and you're in pain.
so why don't you let me take a shot at it?
a shot at it? We're talking about my spine.
Mike, Robin didn't exactly go to medical school between lap dances.
I saw what she did. I can do the same thing.
okay. - Here we go.
Ow! - Ow? No "ow." that's exactly what Robin did.
no, she didn't yank it.
it's my arm, not an emergency brake.
Shh. Just take a deep breath.
the key is relaxation. Okay.
one...
two...
you know, if you hadn't moved when I said "three..."
just go.
Oh, my god, Susan. Is Mike gonna be all right?
can I see him? - Sure, sweetie.
just don't climb on the bed.
look, why didn't you wait for me?
I would've taken care of Mike's back, no problem.
well, I wanted to do it myself.
Oh. Okay. Hmm.
I'm lying. I didn't wanna do it.
I just really wanted you not to do it.
I don't understand.
God, I've been trying really hard to be cool about all this.
but when I walked in and I saw you all over Mike...
when... when I was cracking his back?
I was just trying to help.
while you wearing next to nothing and straddling my husband.
how was I supposed to react? You used to be a stripper.
Oh, don't cry. Why are you crying?
strippers are supposed to be tough.
stop calling me that.
Yes, I was a stripper.
but you know what?
you were the only person who never treated me like one, - until now. - Oh.
and I'm really sorry if I crossed the line with Mike.
you know, I guess after working nine years in the club,
I just don't know where the line is anymore.
uh, it's...
I... I overreacted.
maybe I should move out.
no. Robin, you don't have to do that.
I want us to be friends for a very long time.
so, yes, I do.
Ohh!
daddy needs help making the bed go back down.
hello.
Hi. Susan asked me to bring you some of your mail.
Oh, thank you.
