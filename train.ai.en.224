well, that's kind of a long story.
well, that's kind of a personal question, isn't it?
well, that's kind of a signal, don't you think?
well, that's kind of a simplification.
well, that's kind of an important question.
well, that's kind of creepy, that you can...
well, that's kind of hard to do when you don't speak English and you're a sex slave.
well, that's kind of hard to say, see, 'cause he never had a winner.
well, that's kind of harsh.
well, that's kind of kicking a man when he's down, isn't it?
well, that's kind of kicking a man when he's down, isn't it?
well, that's kind of like turning a sock inside out.
well, that's kind of my mission in life.
well, that's kind of personal.
well, that's kind of sick.
well, that's kind of strange, don't you think?
well, that's kind of sudden.

well, that's moronic.
well, that's moronic.
well, that's most of it.
well, that's much appreciated,
well, that's much appreciated, but, you know, your money's no good here.
well, that's much appreciated,
well, that's much better.
well, that's much sexier, isn't it?
well, that's music to my ears. And the bad news?

well, that's no way to sell newspapers. Try,
well, that's no white woman. She's a squaw.
well, that's none of my business.
well, that's none of our business.
well, that's none of your business.
well, that's nonsense. I was with her only this morning.
well, that's not a choice. - It is a choice,
well, that's not a fresh zombie. Only fresh zombie bleeds, hon.
well, that's not a good answer.
well, that's not a good answer.
well, that's not a good question.
well, that's not a good question.
well, that's not a good trait for someone who investigates the navy.

well, that's not so strange
well, that's not so strange.
well, that's not so strange.
well, that's not so strange
well, that's not something I've ever gotta worry about.
well, that's not something the general public's
well, that's not something you have to face.
well, that's not something you have to face.
well, that's not strictly true, now is it?
well, that's not super helpful.
well, that's not surprising.
well, that's not that much
well, that's not the case at all.

well, that's not the whole story.
well, that's not the word I was going to use, but...
well, that's not the word you used at the time.
well, that's not too bad.
well, that's not true, but I can act nice.

well, that's not true. I get a little joy, but it's tempered with sadness.
well, that's not true. I pay taxes.
well, that's not true. I spend tons of time!
well, that's not true. If you don't wanna smoke...
well, that's not true. It's gonna hurt like hell - especially down here.
well, that's not true. Now, don't make me show you, really.
well, that's not true. Oh, give it up.
well, that's not true. You left out the key piece of information, didn't you?
well, that's not true. You left out the key piece of information, didn't you?
well, that's not try - why is it so hard for you to accept a compliment?
well, that's not unusual for a girl of her age.
well, that's not unusual. The child protects the parent,
well, that's not usually something women carry.
well, that's not vague.
well, that's not very convincing.
well, that's not very good, is it?
well, that's not very grateful of you
well, that's not very likable.
well, that's not very likable.

well, that's not what happened. I didn't even know she was there.
well, that's not what he did.
well, that's not what he told me.
well, that's not what it looks like, Mr. Keister.
well, that's not what it's all about. That's part of it.
well, that's not what she said.
well, that's not what they're saying.
well, that's not what we agreed on.

well, that's not what we're saying.
well, that's not what you said last Friday.
well, that's not what you said.
well, that's not what you told me.
well, that's not why I'm here talking to you now.
well, that's not working anymore,
well, that's not working.
well, that's not worth letting yourself go to pieces for!
well, that's not your call, director.
well, that's not your job. That's mine.
well, that's not...
well, that's notalways easy
well, that's nothing compared to the fires you'll face on judgment day.
well, that's nothing too out of the ordinary for somebody
well, that's nothing, is it!
well, that's nothing, is it!
well, that's now what I hear. Jesus.

well, that's nowhere near where our first victim lived worked.
well, that's obvious - what?
well, that's obvious, my dear.
well, that's obvious, my dear. We're searching for clues.
well, that's obvious, or a young man wouldn't be dead.
well, that's obvious. It's the racetrack referee.
well, that's obvious. It's... Whichever one's lighter is the air.
well, that's obvious. it's...
well, that's obviously not the jerk that I know.
well, that's obviously not true,
well, that's obviously the killer trying to cover his tracks.
well, that's odd since we're doing math.
well, that's odd. - what?
well, that's odd.
well, that's odd. I already tried that.
well, that's odd. The victim had a deep, even tan. We collected low SPF oil from the locker.
well, that's odd. They were supposed to be here by now.
well, that's odd. What?
well, that's off the table.
well, that's off.
well, that's okay, I can do it faster.
well, that's okay, I can do it faster.
well, that's okay, because I'm a lady.
well, that's okay, because I've got millions of ideas.
well, that's okay, detective, because we're not investigating her rape.
well, that's okay, then.
well, that's okay, your honor. I have nothing further.
well, that's okay. I - I don't have anything else planned.
well, that's okay. I can take that.
well, that's okay. I don't mind fightin for an impossible cause.
well, that's okay. I don't really need a servant.
well, that's okay. I'd bore the pants off you.
well, that's okay. Nobody here at school?.
well, that's okay. We're not afraid of ghosts.
well, that's old school.
well, that's on you.
well, that's one I haven't heard, I must say.
well, that's one arrest that's really gonna cost her.
well, that's one big "if," detective.
well, that's one good thing to come out of all this.
well, that's one good thing to come out of all this.
well, that's one hell of a script. You got more?
well, that's one hell of a script. You got more?

well, that's one less thing to worry about.
well, that's one less thing to worry about.
well, that's one of your problems solved.
well, that's one off my desk.
well, that's one option.
well, that's one option.
well, that's one possibility, I recommend that we run a test -
well, that's one problem you didn't have with me.
well, that's one theory. - get back!
well, that's one theory.
well, that's one thing she is right about.
well, that's one thing she'll always have from me, anyway.
well, that's one thing we have in common.
well, that's one thing we have in common.
well, that's one thingwe have in common.
well, that's one thingwe have in common.
well, that's one way of approaching things.
well, that's one way of doing it.
well, that's one way of keeping score.
well, that's one way of looking at it, yes, but, really, who cares?
well, that's one way of looking at it.
well, that's one way of looking at it.
well, that's one way of putting it, yes.
well, that's one way things are gonna be different this week.
well, that's one way things are gonna be different this week.
well, that's one way to be the center of attention.
well, that's one way to do it.
well, that's one way to go. But maybe you want to slow down.
well, that's one way to look at 12 years in and out of prison.
well, that's one way to look at it.
