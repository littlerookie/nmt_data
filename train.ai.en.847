assault Two One Bravo's gone.
echo Three Lima is up on Two One Bravo.
we made a mistake today...
collectively and individually.
we must get past this.
can't sit around and call it quits now. We have fighting ahead.
look, guys, we're Americans.
we must make sure when we take a shot that we are threatened.
you gotta see that these people are just like you.
you gotta see past the huts, the camels, the different clothes they wear.
these are people in this fucking country.
this family here might lose a son.
we shot their camels too.
one camel could be a year's income to them.
we're not here to destroy their way of life.
Trombley, you have to be prepared for the possibility of a formal investigation in this shooting.
you need to write it up.
keep your head up.
is it going to be okay, Sergeant?
I mean this...
investigation?
you'll be fine, Trombley.
no, I mean for you, Sergeant, since you gave the all orders.
I don't care about any of this, you know?
I'll be out in a couple of years.
but you...
sergeant, this is your career.
I'll be fine.
Hitman Two Three, this is Hitman Two Two.
watch my six. I'm taking a dump.
Roger that.
I don't want to sound like I'm defending Trombley or anything...
but how come nobody remembers that they declared everybody hostile?
I mean, they told us to shoot at everybody.
Yeah.
but you know what's even more fucked up?
Trombley only shot two bursts maybe seven rounds.
I mean, we're bumping down a dirt road, his targets are like 200 meters out and he hits exactly what the fuck he's shooting at?
I mean, fuck, man, the boy is a cold-on deadeye killer.
Yeah, no shit.
that's 'cause he's a psycho.
but at least he's our psycho.
you all right, reporter?
Yeah, I'm just...
sucking wind.
what happened today...
you need to square those walls.
you'll never make any progress digging that way.
we got the best platoon commander and the whole fucking battalion's on his ass because he did the right thing and stood up to Encino man.
it ain't the hajis gonna kill us, man.
it's fucking command.
doc This is your chance to get a little something off your chest.
you asking me to speak frankly? - Yes. Well...
well, sir, it's just that you're incompetent, sir.
Eric, what can I do for you?
sir, it's about the enemy A. Ks you've been firing from your vehicle.
you're endangering us.
Jesus Christ, Eric. - Respectfully, sir, you fire an A. K. one more time, I'll fuck you up.
I can't have people questioning the orders of a superior officer.
and if you have a performance complaint regarding subordinates, that has to go through the proper channels.
Trombley, get the fuck down!
that's a Zeus. - What the fuck is a Zeus?
it's a Russian antiaircraft gun.
Hey, Sergeant, I think I see where the fire's coming from.
you psycho badass.
this may sound weird, but deep down, I kinda wanted to see what it feels like to get shot.
our objective is the M. S.R. on the north side.
we're seizing it ahead of R. C.T. One's assault through the city.
I know this looks like some "Black Hawk Down" shit we're doing, but we'll be the ones initiating contact. Not the bad guys.
all right, gentlemen, you heard the man.
let's go set up a roadblock.
did they understand the warning shots?
the R. O.E. aren't a lot of help here.
we're all alone.
we've got an full mechanized division up there in Al Kut.
and there's 70 of us, brad, holding this road.
a Burning Dog
Quizmaster, this is Godfather. I have you loud and clear.
stand by for tasking.
your mission is to conduct this feint in force, uncover enemy positions prior to the main force's arrival.
how copy? - Roger. Solid copy on all.
one, two, three, four little people outside.
plus the three old ladies.
look, Gabe. Haji soccer.
tough little haji.
my grandma used to beat me with a 2x4.
your grandma mean like that, Gabe?
no, man. My grandma hit me because she loved me and she wanted me to turn out good.
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
we've had eyes on the village for over one hour now.
there are seven women and children, no adult males.
no sign of the men who fired those mortars.
how copy?
this is Hitman Two. Solid copy.
what the fuck is that smell? - M. R.E. cookies.
what I did was I saved up all those creamer packets and all the sugars and I mixed in peanut butter until I sort of made...
don't set your face on fire again.
word to the mother fuckin' street, yo!
I was not the one who set my face on fire.
I was the fuckin' victim and you know it.
sergeant Colbert,
I was thinking...
those trees over there behind us, maybe the guys who fired at us were in them.
much as I appreciate Rolling Stone's tactical input, but I'm confident in the birds.
birds?
anything moves in those trees, birds don't sing.
Sgt. Espera? - Yeah?
do you have any more of that enaction shit?
Tenactin. - Yeah, cause this thing...
Jesus Christ!
did we call it, Sergeant?
someone called it. - Fucking Godfather called it, - 1, 000-pounder from a navy F-18. - God damn it.
we don't have the full picture. - It was on fucking battalion tac.
we had mortars fire at us from somewhere near that hamlet. Maybe...
maybe inside.
the bad guys shoot and scoot. By the time we hit bac they're gone.
I am not the one who asked the enemy to mix in with the civilian populace and use them as cover to attack us.
this is Hitman Two. R. T.B. Over. - Roger.
we're moving out.
man, we keep making the same fucking mistakes.
my fucking cookies got schwacked.
what the fuck is his problem?
come on, Ray.
we're Oscar Mike.
someone around here is hiding a mortar team!
I warn you again, we will destroy your village not only if you yourself are hostile, but if you are harboring any enemy elements!
is he threatening me?
he's grateful to be liberated and pleased to cooperate.
these people are worse than the goddamn V. C!
Dave, we've got Meesh.
not that we're doing any better than the French in Indochina.
I mean, we're making every French mistake, right?
this dude has some cool shit.
give me the map board.
moreno, how much longer we gonna be here?
he said the men came from outside, - not from his village. - How many men?
he used a word that means a lot of dudes.
and he says they're planning to ambush us once we cross the bridge.
said there are men on the east side, north side, and the west side.
and the men on the east side, they got the big guns.
all Hitman Victors, this is Hitman.
Hitman Three is debriefing locals. - Hey, Person.
didn't your mom put your picture up on the Wal-Mart wall of heroes?
Yep.
my grandma did when I went to Afghanistan.
I'm on the Nevada, Missouri Wal-Mart wall of heroes.
even got my dress blues on.
if my mother ever distributed my likeness without written authorization,
I would disown her.
technically speaking, Brad, but didn't your biological parents disown you when they put you up for adoption?
point, Ray.
I was one of those unfortunates adopted by upper-middle-class professionals and nurtured in an environment of learning, art, and a socio-religious culture steeped in over two thousand years of Talmudic tradition.
not everyone is lucky enough to have been raised in a Whiskey Tango trailer park by a bowlegged female whose sole qualification for motherhood is a womb that happened to catch a sperm of a passing truck driver.
at least my mom took me to Nascar.
your dad's a truck driver?
you okay?
it's all good, brother.
hello.
Asalaam alaikum.
that doesn't get you, poke?
come on, it'll be good for you.
Asalaam alaikum.
here.
here you go.
see?
don't you feel better?
fuck it, dawg.
you think giving them some rice and a chocolate bar is gonna fix things?
change of plan.
we have a village here providing info on a possible ambush on the road ahead.
well, let me guess, sir.
the plan is for us to drive into it and draw fire.
you'll be happy to know there is no plan for this.
godfather's pulling us back.
the R. C.T. is pushing up some L. A.Vs to clear out the ambush.
we're staying in a wadi south of the bridge.
get some!
this is how this ought to be fought.
we feel our way up these back roads, generate intelligence, and they send some real ass in to deal with it.
you really believe pulling us back from one ambush represents a change in strategy?
there's no reason battalion can't accidentally make a smart decision now and then.
even a broke-ass clock is right twice a day.
what's this I'm hearing about Casey Kasem going around in front of E-3s and 2s, calling Lieutenant Fick a coward?
Yeah.
Jesus fucking Christ.
at least we ain't in the position of having to babysit our platoon Commander.
I heard back in the rear once they had a plan to push Navy psychiatrists forward to combat units.
Yeah, I scoffed then, but if ever there was a candidate to be locked up in the rubber tent, we know who he is.
can you imagine what the doctors would make of Ray Person?
need I remind you that he is the best damn R. T.O. in the business?
as long as you keep him away from your uglier daughters and your smaller livestock.
no.
the individual who needs his head examined is the man responsible for taking arguably the finest damn independent recon operators of any military in the world, and dropping us in Humvee platoons to lead a parade of pogs, officers, and heavily-armed subhuman morons like Casey Kasem across Mesopotamia.
how much does Uncle Sam spend on us?
jump school, dive school, mountain warfare, ranger school, S. E.R. E.
that's a $1, 000, 000 on average to train up 0321s like us.
and here we are, perfectly-tuned Ferraris in a demolition derby.
it sure isn't Afghanistan.
any of us had been running our teams in that AO, we sure wouldn't have dropped a bomb on that village like they did this morning.
gentlemen, to Afghanistan.
in Somalia we were still able to target these legit motherfuckers...
hold what you got, warriors.
november Juliet's coming around. - Better watch your face, Ray.
Rudy's got the espresso pot brewing.
Yeah, it's obvious I was wrong about invading Iraq for NAMBLA.
it turns out we're actually here to set up a forward Starbucks.
Christ, look, we've already inserted our Fruity Barista.
thank you very much.
now all we need is some shitty fucking music playing, like Norah Jones, a couple of high-school girls getting super fat on iced lattes, a homeless guy trying to scam the key to the restroom, and some faggot writing his novel on a laptop.
Gunny, this must steam Godfather, letting other guys go into an ambush instead of us.
I've never understood what the whole rush was about in the first place.
there is no doubt America is gonna beat Saddam's military.
so why rush this shit? - Ray, remember that guy that got his dick cut off and sewed back on?
Yeah. John Wayne Bobbit.
he's a former Marine. - What other famous Marines were there?
lee Harvey Oswald, that old children's television show host Captain Kangaroo, he was one;
and uh, the guy who climbed the university of Texas clock tower and shot 16 people.
no presidents? - Closest we got was Oswald.
I met John Wayne Bobbit. - Get the fuck out of here.
I interviewed him when he was trying to be a porn star.
he did this movie where - Nice!
he fucked a midget.
a Marine will fuck anything.
she was a nice girl, seriously.
here you go, Gunny.
thank you, Rudy.
looks like we're in for a cold night by the way - that Zoolander's nipples are twisted. - Thanks, Rude.
let me hook you up, my backwoods brother.
pappy.
I always gotta fix you up, Pap.
looks like you've got some chafing here from your sapi plate.
I've got some emollients in the Humvee.
I'll get the Neutrogena.
am I pushing you, my man?
am I going too far?
pappy, you know I love you, brother.
Rudy, you motherfucker, hook me up with some of that sweet November Juliet.
Roger that. - Why November Juliet?
it's like, military phonetic alphabet.
you know, like - Whiskey Tango for white trash. - Yeah, I get that.
but what does November Juliet stand for?
nigger juice.
beautiful.
Jesus Christ, dude.
gentlemen, as you can see...
I'm told by the C. G. that the reason for our chow shortage is that 95% of the one MarDiv supply train in central Iraq is being allocated to haul artillery rounds to the front.
for us tonight, gentlemen, this is good news.
we are on a new map sheet, the last for phase three of our mission.
I can reveal to you tonight that the C. G.'s objective since pushing through Nasiriyah has been this:
al Kut.
here, to the east of Baghdad,
al Kut holds the only major bridge crossing the Tigris.
since the inception of phase one,
CENTCOM has felt the need to control this eastern route to Baghdad.
phase four, the assault on Baghdad, cannot begin until Marines own Al Kut and its bridge.
three words:
tempo, tempo, tempo.
the swiftness of our advance has succeeded in outpacing the Iraqi military's efforts to organize large-scale resistance.
tonight,
Ferrando expects our tempo to increase.
this afternoon,
Bravo company exploited the willingness of locals to provide intelligence regarding an enemy ambush.
that was good work.
no doubt many of you were disappointed when division sent in the R. C.T.'s light armored units to clean them out.
by all rights, that should have been our tasker.
but it turns out the C. G. hasn't forgotten about us.
we have reports that increasing numbers of paramilitary forces are moving into this area south of Al Kut.
tomorrow morning, the R. C.T. will begin its final push to Al Kut on the east bank of the canal.
our push begins tonight.
we are to advance along the western side of the canal starting at approximately 2300 hours local time.
there's a town here, Muwaffaqiyah.
it's about four kliks north of our current position.
soon as we pass Muwaffaqiyah, we've got 30 kliks of highway to Al Kut.
this, gentlemen, is our happy hunting ground.
the C. G. has given us free rein to initiate contact all along this M. S.R.
there's not a Marine on the planet who wouldn't want to be in your shoes tonight, gentlemen.
quick word, please?
looks like we're the quarterback again.
look, as far as executing this play, are we gonna have any...
personal issues, skipper?
not on my part, sir.
I do however have an issue with unprofessional conduct of senior enlisted personnel in this company.
Nate, I... - Gunnery Sergeant, you do not come up on a discussion between the Captain and myself and speak unless you are spoken to.
and nobody fucking spoke to you.
aye aye, Lieutenant.
I want to be certain that senior enlisted personnel are not speaking for you when airing derogatory opinions about the command of my platoon.
if such opinions are yours, I would ask that you share them directly with me in private.
opinions?
anyone who says I have opinions like you said, Nate, he's not on my team.
very good, sir.
without the right lubricant, it's the same thing again and again. Sucker just jams.
we just have to accept that the only dependable weapon you have up there is your saw.
you guys,
I just did a really dirty thing.
you know that picture of Rolling Stone's girlfriend?
I think it's safe to say we all know her intimately at this point.
I got it back from Bravo Three and I swear I was gonna give it back to him.
but I ran into Wasik on the way over here.
I traded that bitch for some pec-2 batteries!
ray, you pimped her out.
she is a dirty little hoochie, isn't she?
got any for the thermals?
Jesus, dude. It's a picture of a reporter's girlfriend, not of J. Lo's cum-dripping twat.
Yeah, you're right.
Walt, get some sleep.
I'm gonna give this another try, Brad. You get some sleep.
Thanks, Walt.
what's the challenge and pass?
blue diamond, blue diamond, asshole!
Q-Tip, what the fuck?
I had to get medieval on his ass.
what is it?
I don't know, but it's got fur and four legs and a little bit a meat.
all Victors, have team leaders rally up on Hitman Two Victor. Over.
Yeah, copy that.
Brad, get up.
56 minutes.
I've been asleep for 56 minutes.
team leader meeting.
56 minutes and just one dream.
at least you got the dream.
I dreamt I was in Iraq. - Were you naked?
north of our position is the wild west.
we all know we've killed a lot of bad guys already.
sure.
must be some bad guys in all those women and children we've been stacking along the roads.
those who remain are going to take their last stand here.
bad news is we don't sleep tonight.
good news is we get to kill bad guys.
in six zero mikes, Bravo company and Charlie company are maneuvering onto the western side of this canal.
our orders are to set up positions as we see fit along the M. S.R.
and hunt for paramilitaries operating in the A-O.
our goal is to terrorize the Fedayeen, and this platoon will be on point.
better us than Captain America.
the point is we are taking the initiative.
and they're letting us do it at night when we have the advantage.
sir, need I remind you a lot of that advantage resides in our thermals, and we don't have a single working set in the entire platoon?
Brad, we've still got our N. V.G. s, pec-4s and 17-bravos.
Yes, sir.
sir, the regiment's staying over on the eastern side of the canal?
affirmative. - And we got - Alpha and H-and-S staying behind? - We're going lean.
we're hunters tonight. - That's all good, sir.
but how do we get around this bridge and the town up to where the L. A.Vs was fighting?
we're not going around it.
Brad, your team will be leading us across it.
sir, is my team to do a foot patrol to get eyes on the bridge and make sure that the enemy ambush has in fact been eliminated?
negative, Brad.
reconnaissance, sir.
isn't that what reconnaissance Marines are supposed to do?
our timetable does not allow for a foot patrol.
the chances for a serious threat are very low.
we hit those ambush points hard all night.
sir, if the L. A.Vs came back with casualties, how's Humvee supposed...
frankly, gentlemen, I'm not hearing the aggressiveness I'd like.
prepare your teams to step off. - Sir.
the people running this war can fuck things up all they want.
and as long as we keep getting lucky and making it through alive, they'll just keep repeating the same mistakes.
our orders are clear.
I would not help this platoon by questioning him or hesitating in any way.
the C. O. reached out to me.
I have to honor that, right?
hurry up and grab your gear. Let's fucking go!
Hey, you, get the fuck up! Go !
Hey, yo, Person, I changed the batteries in the N. V.Gs.
what's our tad with our Cobra escorts? - None.
we don't have comms. - Why not?
that would be too easy.
I don't know. No one's rogering up on the tads.
this is going to be a short mission.
why don't you stay back here with headquarters?
okay. - Okay.
reporter ain't gonna leave, Brad.
he skips town on us now, might change our luck, and that could adversely affect our ability to survive and complete this mission.
are you kidding?
you don't want to make our luck adverse and all, do you, dawg?
no.
poke, make sure your team watches our mark-19.
if we're down, I want Garza to pick up the slack with your 50.
Roger that.
see you on the other side, sucka.
turn it over, Ray.
Trombley, stow this.
sorry, dude.
pass me some of your ripped fuel.
and I fucking mean it about the country music.
you know Brad, you're right.
now isn't an appropriate time for country music.
I was thinking a little more old-school R&B.
because look, I'm Stevie Wonder, blind as a motherfucker in my piece-of-shit N. V.Gs.
all Hitman Two Victors, this is Two Actual.
we are Oscar Mike.
all right, kids, let's make some money.
all Hitman Two Victors, this is Hitman Two. Increase dispersion. Break.
low illum is restricting our vis on the N. V.Gs. Over.
Hitman Two, Hitman Two Three.
Roger.
Hitman two, this is Hitman Two One Bravo. Roger that.
Hitman Two, this is Hitman Two Two. Solid.
we have the bridge four kliks ahead to the west.
there will be a right turn toward the bridge abutment.
Yeah, roger that.
is that a guardrail on this side of the road?
it's the shoulder.
it slopes.
I know you've got no depth perception in those N. V.G. s but use some common fucking sense in your situational awareness.
it's the way that the fucking ambient light is slanting in.
I can't tell if dark areas are ditches or walls.
two One Bravo, this is Two One Alpha.
someone on your victor appears to have his I. R. designator on.
two One Alpha. Yeah, it's me, dawg.
I got a foot-mobile, possible tango, about one o'clock, 200 meters out, crouched on a berm.
over.
copy that.
two One Bravo, that is a trash bag caught on some kind of scrub brush.
what's going on? - Nothing.
it's our I. R. lasers.
you can't see them without N. V.G. s.
I don't even have a plastic bag to shoot.
Oh, now remember James, once you fire a bullet, you can't take it back.
God damn it!
two Actual, this is Two One. Interrogative:
do we have any idea what those Cobras are shooting at?
negative, Two One. We have no comms with the Cobras. Over.
fuck!
why are we slowing, Ray?
my N. V.G. s keep going off.
it's from the fucking flashes from the rockets keep washing 'em out.
I can't see shit.
two Actual, interrogative.
are we to continue forward into area being lit by those Cobras?
two One, maintain direction and speed. Over.
Roger that.
cobras are frapping the east side of the river. Over.
hold your sectors!
Oh shit! - Fuck!
Holsey, sweep that area with your I. R.
shit!
you all right, Walt?
nothing.
shell cases hit me.
why are we turning, Ray?
there was a ditch or something in the road.
Hey, something's blocking the bridge.
you see it, Walt?
it's like a connex box in the middle of the road.
all Hitman Two Victors, be advised, there is an obstacle in front of the bridge.
we cannot continue forward.
Hitman Two One, is there any way around it?
negative, Hitman Two. We need to peel.
ray, I need us to egress immediately.
we're in a kill zone here.
Walt, can you see the ditch that I just drove past?
it ain't a ditch.
it's like a drainpipe that's been drug on the road.
you have to make a three-point turn here.
turn around.
I got trees on my left, maybe five meters off the road.
fuck!
Hey, Brad,
Espera's vehicle is in front of us. We're fucking boxed in!
I don't got nobody out here.
I got nothing.
two One Bravo, this is Two One Alpha. We need you to turn around.
over.
two One Alpha, this is Two One Bravo.
two Two is blocking us. Over.
Hitman Two Three, this is Hitman Two. We need you to turn around.
you're boxing the platoon in. How copy?
Eetman Two, dees is Eetman Two Tree.
we hung up on a pipe...
there are men in the trees.
contact right! - Contact right!
contact, three o'clock!
go go!
dismount, 12 o'clock!
suppress him with that saw! - I got him!
two One victor, this is Two Two Victor. We're gonna dismount our vehicles now...
over on the right! Over on the right!
taking fire!
Stafford, to our three!
incoming!
foot mobiles, left!
ray, how's our progress egressing?
all Hitman Victors, this is Two One.
is it at all possible for any of you to back up?
ees two tree...
God damn Baptista!
how the fuck would you like it if I joined the Brazilian Marines and only spoke English?
shift fire!
he's on the works!
watch your four o'clock!
Lilley! - What the fuck?
would you please back the fuck up?
Garza, are we clear? - Not going well!
two Three, get up here. I need suppression fire now!
left side! Left side!
I can't I. D. the target.
Bravo Two's getting chopped up pretty good.
like Brad says, stay frosty, gents.
holy mother of God.
we got a slaughterhouse up there, men!
all gunners, hold your fire!
Eric, watch for infiltrators.
be prepared to fire On my command!
he gives an order to shoot, we'll end up schwacking Bravo Two.
hot mike the radios, dirty.
you got it.
R. P.G!
watch your fire! Watch your fire!
100 meters!
get that . 50 cal up!
fuck yeah!
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
we are unable to move in any direction, over.
this is Two Two.
man down!
say again, team Two has a man down!
over.
who we got, Pappy?
Ah, it's just my foot!
I got you, bro.
Hitman Two, what is the status?
I say again, what is the status of your man down? Over.
I've been hit in the foot.
change your magazines!
I'm out! - Gunny, we need to withdraw!
we need to back it up the way...
back it up the way we came in!
get this shit up!
Christeson, hold your sector!
on the left!
get your weapons up! - Pick up your rate of fire!
shift left, shift left!
mother fucker! Turn it around. I'll be right back!
baptista, turn it around now! We engaged! Turn now!
don't shoot. Lt. is foot-mobile.
up onto the berm, hard right, then go!
Roger that!
Billy, you need to back up onto the berm, hard right, follow rudy.
Rudy, is that Espera to our left? - I'm in, Pappy.
who's to our left? - That's Espera. He's trying to turn!
Garza, how's it looking? - Sergeant, we're clear to our six!
go slow!
talk to me, Walt!
clear! Okay, go go!
clear on the right! Go! - Two One peeling.
all Victors, push past Bravo Three's position and hold.
break, break!
two Two, what is Echo Five Bravo's status?
we've stopped the bleeding. He's stable.
break. What's the status of the Cas-evac? Over.
standby!
Hitman Two Actual, this is Two Three.
all vehicles are up.
push, push, push!
check the tires, Ray.
Jesus Christ.
did you know people shiver when they have an excess of adrenaline?
it cuts the blood flow or something.
they taught us that in S. O.I.
is that what happens to you?
no.
I get a woody.
pappy, man, I'm so sorry.
yeah?
Where's my cope? - Sgt. Patrick, you're late for your Medevac.
all right, go.
good luck, pappy.
I got you covered.
you're team leader now.
get your Victor up. We're moving out again soon.
Lt, sir.
he refused to get Cas-evaced. - I don't want him if he's ineffective.
I took a Shrapnel of his thigh, but it missed the femoral artery.
he tourniqueted himself, sir.
got back up on his weapon and returned fire.
boom, boom. I was taking with flurry of ... sir.
Screwby, sir.
the great destroyers.
Yeah, L. A.Vs rock.
pouring down hate and discontent like a motherfucker.
get your team ready, Poke.
lt. wants us Oscar Mike when they finish.
when they finish fucking shit up there might not even be a bridge.
we're linking up with bravo three ahead.
they are on point. - All right.
I want 15 meters between their last Humvee and ours.
why aren't they sending tanks over the bridge first?
cause they don't know how strong the bridge is, if it'll even hold tanks.
what if it's mined?
that's exactly why they're sending us. I mean, come on, dude.
you don't want to risk a $5, 000, 000 tank when you can send a piece-of-crap Humvee.
all Hitman Two Victors, Hitman Three is Oscar Mike ahead of us.
let's move out.
let's go.
wake up, Trombley!
all Hitman Victors, this is Hitman.
war pig has suppressed targets at the bridge, and tanks have blown barriers at the bridge approach. Over.
this is Hitman Three. Roger that.
hitman. This is Hitman Two Actual. Roger that.
dirty, right through the town!
contact left! R. P.G!
all Hitman. Shift east, 50 meters.
fuck!
we're stuck!
all Hitman Three Victors, vehicle two is stuck. Over.
put in four low. Get us the fuck out of here!
it's not going in!
piece-of-shit Humvee!

Hitman Three, this is Hitman Three Two.
we're in the town.
we observe no enemy activity at this time.
break.
we're still trying to locate a route through.
movement's restricted due to debris. Over.
Hitman Three, you copy my last?
Redman, how close is Hitman Three?
fuck.
he ain't bleeding.
his neck don't look broken.
we lost the platoon.
all Hitman Victors, this is Hitman Three Actual.
this is Hitman Three Actual.
the bridge is partially destroyed! We're trapped!
I say again, we are fucking trapped!
militarily speaking, Kocher, ain't we the only ones that are trapped?
back the fuck up.
where is Hitman Actual? - That way, sir.
roll it over to company.
... Tet offensive. Bullshit!
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
I got some good men dying in there!
hold your sectors, men!
break. Hitman Two, Hitman Two, we need to back these Humvees back...
give me your radio.
there's one thing I learned in ranger school...
hand it to me. - ... we must seize initiative.
keep your eyes on those reeds.
they could be massing a suicide R. P.G. team as we speak.
we don't know. Any movement in there, you...
what the hell is going on here?
we were, we're...
the stuck vehicle, it...
stuck.
I got my best Marines cut off in that town, dying in there!
godfather needs to unfuck this clusterfuck now.
we need to think of this as a defensive line, and a goal-line stand.
and you're the offense, Craig.
you need to be a hard charger here.
put some fuckin' muscle into it.
men!
over here!
two-minute warning, guys, two-minute warning!
Yeah!
Yeah!
... this is Hitman.
bridge is all clear.
sir, you did a favor by taking my radio from me.
gentlemen, this is the end zone!
go yellowjackets!
how's it feel now, you filthy motherfuckers?
God damn dirty haji motherfuckers trying to fuck with me?
fuck you!
that's what you get when you try to ambush Marines, motherfucker!
you get dead!
son of a bitch!
sir, get a load of this.
they don't look like Iraqi regulars.
looks like he could have been a college student.
we've got a wounded enemy.
shoot him!
can you help this man?
he could be booby-trapped, sir.
I'll search him, sir.
because of this dying motherfucker and his dead friends, we're eight hours behind schedule.
look at this motherfucker.
roll him over and check his back.
he's all yours, doc.
amphetamine, pretty high-grade shit.
dude, these are Syrian pounds.
syrian passport.
born in Damascus, age 26, entered Iraq... march 23.
three days after we came.
his address in Iraq is the... Palestine Hotel in Baghdad.
restaurant is two-star, but room service is out of this world.
and if you go around the corner, there's a club where the ladies go, - just... say you're a friend of Uday's. - What does the rest of it say?
purpose for entering Iraq:
jihad.
he put "jihad" at passport control.
that's some wicked shit, some evildoing shit, if you ask me, man.
they're coming here to fight us.
I wonder if President Bush will ever find out about this.
it's what the president's been talking about with the war on terrorists.
this is why we're here.
go on, man, fuck it up.
the fuck is wrong with you, Dawg?
what is it with you white boys?
leave you alone for 10 minutes, you go all "lord of the flies" and shit.
what up, yo?
holy fucking shit, dude.
unreal.
rude, check it out. I'm you.
here, dead.
alive.
I'm dead here. Now I'm alive.
I'm dead. Alive. Dead. - Ray.
what's your point?
just trying to cheer you up, brother.
fucking unreal.
I'm putting you in Trombley's seat when we move out.
you need some rest.
I'm okay Brad.
Trombley slept a couple of hours last night. You didn't.
I want you in some shade inside the Humvee.
lt's boys are eating some weird-ass meat over there.
it's like Jeffrey Dahmer's picnic.
makes you appreciate shit...
makes you appreciate shit like...
good old-fashioned chunked, formed meat patties.
that was some fucking true Iceman shit you pulled last night.
your superhuman powers of observation saved the whole platoon.
shit, Dawg they thought they were gonna get the drop on Iceman?
fuck no.
the Iceman can see you before you even know you're there.
those guys were untrained amateurs.
Oh yeah?
how come we didn't see them?
you're not as good as me.
what kind of goddamn sadists work at the M. R.E. factory?
10 days and nothing but peanut butter.
when the fuck am I going to get a jalapeno and cheese?
I'm allergic to peanuts.
how's everybody doing?
it's just the same every day now.
dig a hole, eat, kill. - And jack off.
be nice to add some sleep into the mix.
you know funny thing is...
I would done anything to save those shepherds trombley hit.
yesterday I musta killed two, maybe three guys.
I don't feel nothing.
me neither Dawg.
I shot some motherfucker right in the grape, saw the back of his head bust off.
I don't feel nothing.
is this how true warriors feel? - Don't fool yourself.
we aren't being warriors out here.
they're just using us as machine operators, semiskilled labor.
T.L.S.over here.
just about ready, Sir.
the news on Pappy is good.
this morning he was taken to the R. C.T.
shock-trauma, where they loaded him onto a bird.
he's on his way to a navy hospital in Spain.
back at Camp Mathilda, Pappy once said, "Don't pet a burning dog.
I had nodea what he meant by that until 12 hours ago.
last night we pet a burning dog.
I know it. You know it.
there's no use in pretending we didn't.
that's very astute, Sir.
we step off in 30 minutes.
our route is taking us through the center of Muwaffaqiyah, the town we almost made it to last night.
but isn't the bridge damaged, Sir?
there's an alternate route.
I think we can take it from here, Sir.
thank you, Gents.
I got new map sheets of the A. O.
we did pet a burning dog.
in more ways than one.
those jihadists who attacked us?
isn't this the exact opposite of what we want to have happen here?
it's all on that guy's passport. 2 weeks ago he was still a student in syria.
he wasn't a jihadi until we came to Iraq.
Hitman Two. Something is loose in your vehicle.
Roger that.
ray, in about one klik we'll hit the cutoff to the town.
why didn't we go this way last night?
you're not thinking military, dude.
see, bypassing the ambush is just what the ambushers expected us to do.
if they expected us to bypass them, why did they set up the ambush?
because they're not professional military.
slow down, Ray.
shit, those could be more of those dudes we fought last night.
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
on our two o'clock we are passing a group of foot-mobiles, all male, early 20s, definitely not from around here.
I strongly request permission to set up a snatch mission on them.
how copy?
stand by.
this is two actual.
our request for a snatch has been denied. Over.
Roger. Thanks for trying.
Jesus, look at all that ordnance.
this looks like jihad central.
all Hitman Two Victors, we are to proceed to our objective as per Godfather's orders.
all Hitman Two Victors, this is Hitman Two.
hold your sectors.
it's weird.
we had one guy shot in the foot and another guy take a little shrapnel in the leg, and we level half the town.
hajis gotta learn.
Hitman Two One, the M. S.R. that we're blocking is on the northeast corner of the town.
push through to that point.
copy that.
ray, push through to the edge of town.
we're setting up a roadblock.
Hey, you got that camera working again? I thought that shit was dead.
Yeah.
we got team three accompanying engineers to check out a Ba'ath military installation.
cool cool.
we got kids up the alley.
don't shoot.
they're just curious.
republican guard took over every classroom.
now we get to blow up a school.
this is every fourth-grade boy's fantasy.
we know kids were here until February.
now that's freaky.
Yeah. Why'd these kids draw little girls with blonde hair?
saddam was even trying to steal our holiday.
that's fucking twisted.
Oh, shit.
I don't like it when civilians flee, Dawg.
Meesh has debriefed some locals who say jihadists are planning to attack us with suicide bombers.
soon as Team Three gets back, we're clearing the town and pushing north.
Roger that, Sir.
what are you doing with that smoke grenade?
what we discussed yesterday, Sir.
new procedure for stopping cars.
Charlie has already started using blue smoke.
I don't like this, Brad.
we fire the smoke grenade 100 meters distant.
if it's bad guys, we have time to light 'em up.
we've got reports of suicide bombers.
we can still kill the cars that don't stop.
this just gives civilians a chance.
I'm asking, Sir.
you do have power over this.
all right.
we got a vehicle.
don't fire unless they drive through and I give the order.
you turned him, Sergeant.
no shit, you obvious motherfucker.
all Hitman Two Victors, this is Hitman Two Three.
controlled det in 10, 9...
we got a controlled det in five, four,
why'd we leave that ordinance out in the field if we're gonna blow up the only school in this town?
am I missing something?
got another one coming at us.
fuck, Walt!
you didn't even fire a warning shot.
that was a wounding shot, motherfucker!
you okay?
the car kept coming.
Yeah.
come on.
sit down.
it's all right.
holy shit. Check it out.
that's some real rob zombie shit, man.
nice shooting.
we're just doing our jobs.
all Hitman Victors, the battalion has cleared Muwaffaqiyah.
we are to advance up to al kut immediately.
mount up.
we're Oscar Mike.
we're Oscar Mike!
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
we've had eyes on the village for over one hour now.
there are seven women and children, no adult males.
no sign of the men who fired those mortars.
how copy?
Jesus Christ! Did we call it, Sergeant?
someone called it.
fucking Godfather called it,
he said the men came from outside, not from his village.
how many men?
he used a word that means a lot of dudes.
and he says they're planning to ambush us once we cross the bridge.
and the men on the east side, they got the big guns.
don't you feel better?
you think giving them some rice and a chocolate bar is gonna fix things?
we are on a new map sheet, the last for phase three of our mission.
our push begins tonight.
look, Nate, as far as executing this play, are we gonna have any...
personal issues, skipper?
not on my part, sir.
there are men in the trees.
contact right! - Contact right!
dismount, 12 o'clock!
suppress him with that saw! - I got him!
yesterday I must killed two, maybe three guys.
I don't feel nothing.
me neither Dawg.
I shot some motherfucker right in the grape, saw the back of his head bust off.
I don't feel nothing.
what are you doing with that smoke grenade?
sir We fire the smoke grenade 100 meters distant.
if it's bad guys, we have time to light 'em up.
fuck, Walt!
that was a wounding shot, motherfucker!
you okay?
the car kept coming.
stay Frosty
this is, boom boom.
boom boom copy, Seven Two. Go ahead.
friendlies are south. Go ahead and egress.
T0T1A mobilized and ready for remarks.
copy, Seven Two. I copy all. Ready for remarks.
fuck!
sir?
what the fuck? - Jesus, Eric.
I thought that haji was killing you.
I fucked his shit up good, didn't I?
you stuck him in a magazine.
better luck next time, sir.
damn, sir. Your hamster must have fell off its wheel.
all Hitman Two Victors, this is Hitman Two.
continue digging in. We're holding here while R. C.T. One advances. Over.
R. C.T. One is moving into Al Kut.
it's about time they carried their weight.
Kocher is on patrol in this zone.
do not engage on your left beyond eleven o'clock.
copy on all, Three Two. Godfather out.
I'm taking him to a field interrogation.
it's all good.
he's your capture.
shit, he'd probably fuck up the report.
mobile One One this is boom boom. You got wind of One Five.
Roger...
the officers are assembled. - Let's go right away.
as of 0915 hours forward elements of Colonel Dowdy's regiment seized the main bridge over the Tigris river in Al Kut.
as you know, I just returned from a meeting with General Mattis.
what you don't know is that shortly after Dowdy led his regiment into Al Kut,
general Mattis relieved him of his command.
and gentlemen,
Colonel Dowdy was also relieved of the ammo for his sidearm.
Colonel Dowdy was a good man, but he did not fully embrace maneuver warfare.
and lest we forget, maneuver warfare is America's warfare for the 21st century.
it is all about the violence of action.
with first recon at the tip of the spear, 7, 000 Marines have just completed the corps' longest march since the barbary campaign against Tripoli in 1803.
actually, some of you are riding in the same Humvees they used.
through our use of maneuver, we have tied down many times our number of the enemy's force, opening the door for the army to invade the enemy capital from the west.
sir, does this mean it's the end of our mission?
unknown.
but the First Marine Division is positioning itself on the outskirts of Baghdad for the assault, and we will be there.
rest assured,
godfather will find a mission for this battalion.
but what I want to leave you with today is this:
Colonel Dowdy did succeed this morning.
he did lead his men into Al Kut.
but General Mattis has a long memory.
he did not forget that at critical moments
dowdy hesitated to execute orders.
and gentlemen,
Ferrando has a long memory too.
Gunny, that stuff about the General's memory and Dowdy being relieved, was Godfather talking about us in there?
I believe he meant, sir, that if you don't square away Nate Fick, you'll be in his sights.
Gunny, the men get those new M. R.Es?
they did. They're happy.
these are the new ones with milkshakes.
there's strawberry, chocolate and vanilla.
didn't you get Hasser's report on shooting that civilian?
we've got to take care of this as covering bullshit.
it'll be good for Hasser too.
he does his duty, gets back to being a Marine.
Thanks, Mike. You're a fucking nag.
Hey, Walt.
feel the love.
baby. - Just leave me the fuck alone.
finally, he speaks.
I liked it better when we were starving.
then I didn't have to see shit all over your face.
want some?
finish your report and get it to me ASAP.
you did nothing wrong.
but we're gonna see if there's a better way to stop these cars.
Walt's got a great way, Lt.
shoot the driver, stop the car.
sir, it's vital.
Hasser will write his way clear, but we're fast becoming an army of occupation.
we can't just shoot these civilians like we're doing.
Marines aren't cops, Brad. We're an aggressive force.
that said, we'll see what we can do.
Hey, fuck it, Walt.
these haji motherfuckers are trying to kill us.
I'm for lighting up every motherfucker that comes within 100 m.
damn, man.
didn't we kick their asses already?
this is really interesting.
you know, Iraqis don't really seem good at fighting, but then they never really completely surrender either.
put down that fucking milkshake and dig a fucking hole.
why, so I can be more like the teacher's pet?
Yeah, that's exactly it.
you should be more like Trombley. - More like Trombley?
more like Trombley?!
Whopper Jr. - Give me the hook.
Whopper Jr.
anybody find that extra pin from the gypsy rack?
no, we still missing that?
that thing's gonna fucking fall off and we're gonna lose all our water cans.
maybe take an extra off and shove those down.
Brunmeier, drink the fucking water.
how are they doing? - Ass to mouth disease.
half the guys got the shits.
both right now? - Yeah, take 'em.
it's a good thing this is over.
fuck!
for us, anyway.
manimal just dropped a case of grenades.
see? That's why we can't have nice things.
fucking hick.
you wanted to see me, sir? - Nate, did you hear?
general Mattis shitcanned Colonel Dowdy.
he took the ammo from his sidearm, lieutenant.
Colonel wasn't a team player.
godfather said we should all play on the team.
if it can happen to a full bird Colonel, it can happen to anyone.
so you know, there will be no more questioning of my orders.
respectfully, sir, I've only tried to interpret your intent to the best of my ability.
captain, sir.
here comes the warrior on our team.
outstanding work last night taking down that E. P.W.
just doing my job. - Looks like he put up quite a fight.
a fight like that tells me the company took in a high value asset.
he did not want to surrender.
you have the after-action report?
sergeant Kocher is bringing it.
while your platoon has been busy shooting civilians at roadblocks
Bravo Three was taking in live prisoners.
I heard.
good work, Dave.
anybody got any chow over there?
what do you want?
I'll take anything I can get at this point.
tell Victor Three to get on the road, we got C. A.O. checks.
this'll be handy if we write your platoon up for a commendation.
sergeant, your E. P.W. put up quite a struggle.
it's a good thing your C. O. was there.
if you want to believe what was the reason for this meeting?
right.
battalion says we're moving on.
that's ASAP, Lieutenant.
lieutenant, I was about to... - Yeah, but no.
not the right time.
why were they calling you Whopper Jr?
they were calling me that?
why were they calling him that?
Brad, we got foot mobiles. - Hitman Two, this is Two One.
we've got a bunch of foot mobiles at 11 o'clock.
Interrogative: do they have weapons?
hostile intent? - They got naked intent.
be advised, there's a minivan pulling off the road.
Roger.
be vigilant, over. - Trombley, range the Mark-19.
bad guys could be in that van.
stand by, Hitman Two.
Roger, standing by.
Walt, watch your fucking sector.
it looks like we caught these guys in the act, trying to change their uniforms.
two Actual, we ought to halt the convoy here.
Roger that, Two One.
they say they were robbed.
lying motherfuckers.
tell us where you hid your uniforms.
your documents.
they say there were robbed by the soldiers.
they stole their clothes and siphoned the gas from the car.
lieutenant Fick, sir!
over here!
be careful of the one on the right!
he's got a horse cock like Manimal's. You don't want to get that thing angry.
sir, we have three Arab males naked.
it appears they've been shot execution style.
H. M.C. Bryan investigating the cause of death has determined all three have been killed with gunshot wounds to the back of the head.
good work, Rudy.
team Two at your service, sir. - Team leader of the year, Rudy Reyes.
this ain't our work.
dudes are telling the truth.
he says they are farmers. One family brothers.
I don't think he's lying.
command Two, this is Two One Bravo.
I've got an English speaking haji in this minivan waving around his wife beater.
says they got jacked by some Iraqi soldiers.
americans, you win battle, beat Saddam's army.
now his army beat us. What you do?
they rob us.
what do you do?
listen, this is something you're gonna have to...
you have to take it up with the U. N.
okay?
just stay back from the road.
and you don't have to wave your T-shirts around anymore, all right?
here.
found a haji helmet.
fits good.
how do I look?
like a target.
it's better than nothing.
what we did, running and gunning through those towns, the good stuff and the bad was all part of the plan.
of all the Marines in the 1st division, the General selected us to be the instrument of long range strategy.
we led the feint to Al Kut.
we tied down two Iraqi divisions, saved untold numbers of U. S. soldiers.
you should be proud.
why didn't we go into Al Kut?
Gabe, the General's plan wasn't about taking the city.
it was about making the Iraqis think we were gonna take it.
to be clear, the Commander's intent was never to take it.
the focus has always been Baghdad.
this sucks, man.
we did all this shit because we took a wrong turn?
Gabe, that's not what I'm saying. - You got something better to do?
what the fuck is in your hand?
it's my new helmet, sir.
it's a haji gear I painted Marine camo.
I lost my kevlar in the run to the airfield, remember?
sergeant Major Sixta made me ditch the bike helmet.
how's your teams combat effectiveness?
well, we got Person's allergies, but none of my teams got the shits.
leon and Lilley both have it, but they're still doing their job, sir.
team Two is out.
three is almost as bad.
looks like we'll be nursing this platoon all the way into Baghdad.
my money is we won't be in the assault to Baghdad.
you don't use Humvees to attack an urban center.
you don't use Humvees to strong point a city either, but we did.
maybe they'll hook us up, sir, let us guard some of Saddam's money in one of those palaces.
I don't know.
I just hope we get to fuck up some more shit before the war ends.
they need to send our asses to Baghdad.
reyes, how many guys are sick on your team?
I have three men down, warrior healer.
that makes 14 in the platoon.
are you throwing up?
wake up, Budweiser.
Brunmeier, come on. Wake the fuck up.
I got the shits, doc.
I can't. - Drink some water, you fucking asshole.
what's this about a T72 tank on his side of the perimeter?
it's fucking blown, Gunny. - Reyes.
aye, Gunnery Sergeant.
what kind of team leader are you, not checking out an enemy tank on your perimeter?
Roger that, Gunny.
being I'm the only man on my team not down with the shits
I will take out a patrol.
no, you put the hammer to your team. Like Godfather says, malingering spreads like a yeast infection unless you nip it in the bud.
these men can't walk.
has our Lieutenant approved this order?
he has.
if the men are ill, then you should go with them, corpsman.
I love this guy.
and you'd better watch it, doc.
team Three will take it.
your men are sicker.
doesn't even have a turret.
fucking cocksucker sends us into a fucking swamp to check this weak shit out.
what the hell was that?
I shit my pants.
how are you showing yourself as team leader tonight?
tonight?
Yes, sir. - Where the hell is Lovell's team?
they're out there.
they're inspecting the T72. - A tank? Where?
in the swamp.
they blown out one.
gunnery Sergeant Griego informed us that you...
they're covering your ass, Nate.
what the fuck is going on here?
how would it look if that tank was operational?
I'll tell you what it looks like right now.
it resembles an incompetent moron climbing up the asshole of his company commander by inventing a bullshit mission.
did you seek my authority before tasking my platoon with this?
I did.
I woke you 40 mikes ago to affirm the order.
you woke me?
I hadn't been to sleep in 36 hours.
I have no recollection whatsoever of you waking me.
I thought I was dreaming.
get the fuck out of here.
and do not ever again mess with my platoon.
I was just trying to cover you.
you know you're suspect with battalion.
fuck that.
you can fuck with me all you want but do not,
I repeat, do not fuck with my men.
I'm putting it down, Gunny.
you picking it up?
Stiney, that's my front yard you just puked on there.
sorry.
clumps of them in 10s and 20s.
they're coming from as far as I can see.
quite a party you got going, Damon.
they started showing up at 00 dark 30.
the plan is for my platoon to escort these folks through our lines to the southern checkpoint.
need you to let them through in blocks of 40.
sir, if I may ask, why not send them back to Al Kut?
the fighting's over there. - These people aren't from Al Kut.
they say they're from Baghdad.
they walked over 100 miles?
look, we don't know who anyone is.
could be a suicide bomber among us, so stay frosty.
keep your vehicles at a walking pace and this is important keep a good distance from these people.
Roger.
white boys on my team celebrating the end of our war, sir.
35, 40 at a clip.
keep the families together.
Roger.
smith, bring them through in groups of 35.
keep the families together.
slow walk them.
stay hard.
slow walk them. Slow walking them.
this is Hitman Actual.
keep your eyes open. Watch their hands.
some of them might be armed.
kid, nice jacket.
take this group.
keep your fucking distance from them.
lilley, why don't you take up the rear?
Garza, come up here to the front.
all right?
let's roll. - Bravo, this is Two Two.
don't point weapons at these people, but keep your guns up.
Hitman Two Three, Hitman Two Two. Roger, copy that.
all right, we've got the left side on this one.
two Two, keep an eye on that group coming past your Humvee.
Where's my Trombley?
get these people some water.
not the ass water. Get the bottled.
two Two, keep that group tight. Keep a good pace.
carry that, miss? I got it.
yo, break out some M. R.Es.
like my nigga Tupac said, "it's hard times, man.
Yeah.
make me wanna holler.
word.
what are these?
sure. - Water! Water!
pass them around.
water! - Water water, me me!
keep moving.
easy, easy, easy.
thank you, soldier.
thank you for letting me pass on my own road in my own country.
excuse me, ma'am? - Why are you Americans here?
we want to help you, ma'am.
you know, I come from Baghdad.
it is a beautiful city and you are bombing it.
this is to make my life better?
Brad, we don't have to take this kind of guff.
I mean, we're liberating these ungrateful bitches.
you know, this is a very beautiful country.
and our president is very stupid.
maybe you are here for liberation, I don't know.
but because of oil, it feels like war of aggression.
ma'am, I think you got a really good point.
no, I really do.
really.
so much for death before dishonor.
damn, devil dog, for a piece of ass like that,
I'd sell your sister to Uday and Qusay.
Hitman Two Three, this is Hitman Two.
go on. Go.
don't give that thing to me.
Yeah, I understand. Ma'am, I understand.
here you go.
are you happy now?
man, like this I grow up.
come on.
here you go.
Mikey, give us a hand.
it's okay. Come on.
I got you.
here we go.
easy, easy, easy.
in you go. - That's enough.
no more. Truck's full.
all right, now.
we just turned this combat team into a hay ride.
Thanks.
Obrigado.
got to keep them cool.
doesn't matter what we do here. Quarter of these babies are gonna die.
you all right, Nathan?
yah, Gunny.
I'm good.
we're helping people.
this humanitarian stuff, we get lost in it, we're not combat effective.
this is our future here.
lieutenant, sir!
godfather's on the radio for you. Battalion wants us Oscar Mike.
Yeah, man. On it, thanks.
don't bravo it. Use the smoke first.
what the fuck? Shit!
his fucking head exploded!
guarantee he ain't getting up.
at least we gave him a happy meal before he died. No wait, check that.
before we hit him in the head with a fucking 40 Mike-Mike.
God damn!
how'd the fuck the hajis kill an M1A1?
not a mobility kill.
both tracks look okay.
think the Marines in there got out?
if not, they died fighting a legit enemy.
Jesus, dude. That was first marines.
they've got to be from Oceanside.
Hitman Two One, this is Hitman Two.
the E. C.P. from the division camp is in Grid
over.
Roger,
I copy. Grid Papa Quebec 278394, over.
Hitman Two out.
Hey, those are dogs we ought to shoot.
if I felt we could spare the ammo, I'd give you the order.
Oh, fuck, man.
do not run that over, Ray.
Jesus.
you just can't fucking win.
man, they're prepping Baghdad hard.
and we're in a fucking pog camp.
it's over for us.
we won't be part of the show in Baghdad.
Yup.
this wasn't what we trained for.
I just wanted to get one real recon mission in this war.
you know?
putting us in these is an affront to my warrior spirit.
I'm a hunter, not a fucking truck driver corralling gun platforms.
Brad, we were the fucking first boots on the ground in the American invasion of Mesopotamia.
and you got your men out alive.
might be sad about not getting your mission but for me,
I got to tell you, I'm glad this is over.
one other thing, no more cat holes.
this fucking pog camp we're in has a legit slit trench latrine.
really.
that's my recon mission then.
??? Two on comms.
... Hitman.
Hitman Two Three, this is Hitman Two Two...
over.
Manimal, you're no longer allowed to touch the handset again. Over.
I put my babies down.
think I'm gonna get some shuteye.
I want you to know you've done good, Tony.
you earned a lot of reputation in the recon community as my A. T.L.
you've always had my six.
I just want you to know I really appreciate that.
and it's been...
do you realize the shit that we've done here, the people we've killed?
back in the civilian world, dawg, if we did this, we would go to prison.
poke, you're thinking like a Mexican again.
think like a white man.
over there, they'll be laying on the medals for what we did.
what's with you, dawg?
I'm tweaking, bro.
don't feel right unless I'm strapped.
I'm gonna go pull guard duty.
sir.
sergeant, they're speaking pretty highly of First Recon at division headquarters.
the General thinks we're slaying dragons.
I'm pleased to hear that, sir.
but between you and me, it's bullshit.
you men need another mission.
tanks are gonna lead the way into Baghdad, but we want to get in the game too.
Yes, sir.
be advised, Brad:
stay frosty.
I got her right in front of me! - Show me those titties!
come on, baby! I got 15 large! Give me one ass cheek!
a liberated bitch. - I'm gonna hit that shit.
wearing your desert goggles. That ain't nothing but a piece of nappy haired Whiskey Tango.
he's right, man. You ain't hitting shit. W. M. like that?
no, she be wearing kevlar panties nailed on top of a concertina wire bush.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna do a recon there.
I'm gonna make a path for all you motherfuckers.
shit, man, can you imagine the stank on that cunt?
that is exactly why I'm going!
sir, I'm gonna go down on her like she got all of Saddam's W. M.Ds just buried right between her legs.
you better dig deep. - Oh, Yeah, baby!
hit that gas, come on!
give it a little tap! Pat it, pat it!
it's not that bad over here. Don't kill yourself like that.
shit, go get it, baby. Get some for old J. C.
Oh, shit. Heads up. - Oh, shit, smash!
belays that, Devil Dog!
you're a squealing like a bunch of butt-fucked Vassar bitches!
unfuck yourselves or we gonna suffer the spectacle of a W. M.
with a bunch of horny Devil Dogs trailin' their stern.
get yourselves squared up here.
corporal, you're inappropriatin' your chemical filtration device by attemptin'
fornication wit' it!
Jesus, do I have to tell you not to desecrate your mask with perversions?
where the fuck are your helmets?
fuckin' Sixta.
no sooner do we stop getting shot at, the motherfucker is out here lifing us in his illiterate fucking retardese.
people think they have the authority to kill the minority, man.
fuck the police.
holy shit! - What the fuck?
what the fuck? Get some!
fuckin' Brad.
Yeah! Hell, yeah.
it don't get no better than that.
man over all stations, be advised: Sergeant Colbert is wings level.
can somebody clear him hot?
what, did you give him some Rolling Stone drugs or something?
no.
what the fuck did you do to him?
asked him what he would be if he wasn't Marine.
Oh my god, he wants to be a ballerina?
that's my fuckin' dream.
what the fuck?
you fucking rock.
better now.
ray, I want you to gather the team.
all right.
drop your pots, gents.
sergeant Colbert's giving you a pass.
there's something I've been keeping from you.
I wasn't sure we were gonna live to share this moment.
fuck yeah!
chef Boyardee, the master! - To celebrate.
here, hurry up! - Trombley, get a fire going.
Walt, here.
you deceiving, conniving, hebrew motherfucker.
how were you gonna keep this from your dearest pal Rayray?
I got one more secret to share.
Juggs! - No no! Wait! Not yet.
I need some I need some time with this alone.
come on. Just give me one. - Just calm down.
you'll get your sloppy seconds with Jasmine.
you gotta share with Trombley.
what? He'll kill her!
eat, fuck, kill all the same, right?
Yeah! All the same if you're a fucking psycho.
I'm telling you, I fear for Jasmine. - Speaking of which, one of you guys still has my girlfriend's picture.
dude,
I hate to tell you this, but your girlfriend's is a kind of a whore.
what?
Yeah, last time I saw her, she was doing all of H&S company.
she doesn't deserve you, man.
brah, civilian food gives me the munchies!
Lilley. - Thanks, Brad.
Arbe are faroni?
what's your problem?
last time the white man gave my people something, it was blankets laced with typhoid.
poke, can't we all just...
get along?
Whopper Jr. you got any tabasco to go with this?
okay, there it is.
you did just call him Whopper Jr.
now what the hell is that about?
we call our man Whopper Jr. because they're sold at Burger King.
burger King.
right. B. K.
baby killer.
Trombley's our little Whopper Jr. ever since he shot those shepherds.
damn, Brad, what else you got hidden in the Humvee?
a fat chick?
shoot some civilians, you get a reputation. Right?
he didn't mean that.
you're a fuckin' messed up hick. You can't even eat ravioli.
I'm eating ravioli.
look at him!
gents, the final battle against Saddam's military began this morning when R. C.T-5 crossed the Diyala river.
the final assault of Baghdad is under way.
now, some of you may have surmised that this is not a game for marines in open Humvees, that while this great battle is being fought, you'd be sitting in a field holding your dicks.
or if you're in h&s company, holding our dicks.
this is a problem that's been gnawing at Godfather since Al Kut.
and the solution was right in front of me the whole time.
gentlemen, the northern flank.
above Baghdad, we assume a significant Republican guard presence, especially since it's this region that's the home to the Sunnis and Ba'athists.
now it turns out this had been weighing on the C. G.'s mind when I went to meet with him last night.
chaos has committed all three regiments to the assault from the east here.
there's a town called Baqubah about 50 kliks north of the city where an iraqi mechanized Republican guard division is unaccounted for.
okay? Now this leaves Chaos's northern flank as tender as the virgin's thigh.
until I met with him, the C. G. thought his only option was to peel off a mechanized battalion.
as a good officer should,
I gave him another option.
gentlemen, we are going to Baqubah.
expect morning orders within 30 mikes.
sir, there's a situation.
despite our best efforts, they came up on our comms this morning.
they know where we are and they're less than two kliks from our perimeter.
sir, we could give them a tangential mission, maybe task them with guarding H&S?
major, we can't unfuck this one.
gentlemen, one other thing:
delta company will be with us.
the reservists have arrived.
all right, that's it.
Lt, what's the date today?
copy that, Two Two. Solid copy.
yo, Dirty, you got a donkey dick?
radiator?
Yeah, wait a minute, Ray.
what the fuck are you doing?
writing in my journal.
about all this shit?
what, about you're singlehandedly winning this war?
that's the type of shit that Cody puts in his little diary.
look, if they say we fought valiantly here,
I want 'em to know we fought retarded.
Yeah, 'cause going into towns, storming an airfield with no observation.
. I work for Captain America. You got fick at least.
I've been telling you, Eric, it don't have to be that way.
one bullet in the head, our whole platoon is squared away.
just stow that fuckin' shit.
you had your chances like everybody else and you haven't done it, so fuck you.
here comes dumbass.
well, guys, it's been groovy.
good work, men.
Yes, sir.
good.
good work.
each man sees things differently in combat.
right now at any time, we could die.
it's almost enough to make you lose your sanity.
to remain calm and stay in a place where you think you will die, that too is the definition of insane.
Nate, you have to become insane to survive in combat.
Yeah.
this is how it comes down to us.
we're on point for the battalion, but first we're linking up with war pig.
we're gonna be rolling with some real ass the fuckin' L. A.Vs.
and good news bad news,
they're giving us the L. A.Vs because they're sending us north of Baghdad, where all Saddam's people are from.
and they don't love us up there like they do down south.
so fuck 'em where they live. - Damn right.
we'll be surrounded by friendlies until here...
the magic line.
no American unit has gone past this line.
a couple tried yesterday and got ambushed.
this...
is bad guy country.
all l right, gents, we got 30 mikes.
somebody's got to win this.
what the fuck are you all moto about?
jumpin' jehoshaphat.
are we that desperate for cannon fodder that they're clearing out the sick, - the lame, the crazy? - Look at you boys?
at what's up with these guys?
what's up, Dawg? - Look at these guys.
how the fuck did you find us? - I came up with Delta.
shit, the fuckin' reservists, dude?
Brad, you're not gonna believe it. It has been madness since day one.
what happened to your cushy liaison gig at Al Jabar?
Yeah, rockin' the fucking side pipe with them air force hotties.
fuck that, I ain't had a war since Somalia I had to get some.
but I seriously would not have jumped ship if it meant rolling with Delta.
what?
Clusterfuck? - They're off the hook.
dude, they don't got any gear or food.
they were pulling escort duty just to eat.
and then they got to rollin' into these hamlets and doing these shows of force you know, cowboy shit for fun. Like this one time, I swear to god, they thought it'd be funny to give these little kids, like, porn mags like Hustler and Maxim and shit, show the little hajis what we're fighting for.
this old Iraqi comes storming out, starts screaming at our interpreter about how we're fucking up their morals or some dumb shit, right?
and he's super fucking pissed. The old man's got an R. P.G.
what?
delta fuckin' freaks. They lob like 26 mark-19 rounds.
they fuck up the whole hamlet.
fuck. - Bull-fucking-shit.
Ollie North filmed the whole fucking thing.
the Oliver North?
Oliver fuckin' North was standing there with a camera crew from Fox filming the whole thing like it was the turning point in the fucking war.
these delta fucks are like L. A.P. D. cops and D. E.A. agents and fucking air marshals.
you know what I mean?
and they're led by this Napoleon douche who is like a Corporal or some shit in Albuquerque P. D. I swear to god, this motherfucker has got cattle horns - on his Humvee. - This is so colossally retarded, - I can't even say anything about it. - Godfather knows.
he's been ducking us on the comms for the past couple weeks.
but they're here now, brad, and they're rolling with you.
no fuckin' way. We're working with reservists?
that's some bullshit.
look at this motherfucker.
check it out. If I'm lying, I'm dying.
that's a real marine.
we're out of our M. O.P. P.S.
right now. - Yes, sir.
you can actually see it rolling downhill.
Yep, here it comes.
change in S. O.P.
out of our M. O.P. P. suits. You've 5 min to get right, then we're red-con one.
we're back in cammies! - So fresh and so clean.
fuck, I don't have bootpants.
my balls smell like Jack's mouth.
how do you know what his mouth smells like?
cause my balls were in it.
what the fuck do they do over there, man?
no, really, if we're not in our M. O.P. P. suits, that means there's no W. M.Ds
if there's no W. M.D. S, then why are we here in the first place?
I knew you were a fucking gay-ass liberal.
you tried to pretend by invading iraq with us, but I knew.
I'm serious, Ray. Isn't that the whole point of us being here?
the point is we get to kill people, you dumb fuck.
what's the difference anyway, man?
I mean, the war's almost over.
we're just about done with this bitch.
shit, man, they're taking everything.
Yeah, they're pretty much liberated around here.
ray, stay focused.
we have a mission. - Yeah, some mission...
cross the magic line.
what the fuck can that be all about?
that's us. War pig, then recon.
the line is on 34 northern.
on the other side? The Iraqis.
and they're mechanized.
focus, Ray.
focus.
watch for mines, Ray.
remember, this is bad-guy country.
reporter, do you know what you're supposed to do if the Humvee gets hit by a mine? You're supposed to curl up like a bitch.
Trombley, make nice. - You know how to curl up like a bitch, don't you, reporter?
what is believed to bethe final assault on the city's defenders.
and now for cricket...
bbc says they're puttin' whoop-ass on Baghdad.
and we're out here in the fucking sticks.
man, turn that shit off.
... disappointing results, "but," he said, "there's always a next time.
we're out here under the radar where nobody knows we're here.
hopefully, it'll fuckin' stay that way.
once more into the great good night.
"cry havoc"and let slip the dogs of war.
man, when I get home, I am gonna eat the fuck out of my girlfriend's pussy.
is that Shakespeare?
Shakespeare wrote that?
about his girlfriend's pussy?
godfather, Godfather.
I take it the L. A.Vs in front of us just crossedthe magic line.
the L. A.Vs report enemy contact on both sides of the road.
rockets, mortars and machine guns.
Hitman, Hitman, small arms fire to our three o'clock, 2-5-0 meters out.
I have no targets.
no targets.
Walt, what are you shooting at?
I got muzzle flashes behind those walls.
hold on, buddy! That's a fuckin'village over there.
I see fuckin' fire coming in. - Not from the houses!
there are people in that village.
all Hitman Two... - They ain't shooting at us.
... one-six north on route green. Break.
they've made contact with a squad-sized force. Over.
Roger.
halt the vehicle. - All right.
l. A.Vs have stopped.
enemy! Enemy, both sides! Break!
my God. Is he crying?
no, he's not.
he's just nervous.
we're gonna die if they don't get us out of here!
they sent us to die!
okay, fuck it. He's crying.
all Hitman Victors, this is Hitman Two.
be advised, the L. A.Vs are egressing to the south. Break.
we pull back into a defensive position and dropping mortars. Over.
that's a solid copy.
Trombley, the L. A.Vs will be coming up on our left.
do not engage.
if you do, they'll schwack us.
Jesus Christ.
tracers skipping around us.
that's our own guys, shooting down the axis of our convoy.
all Hitman Two Victors, hold your fire...
fucking reservists.
hold, Delta. Over.
is that the reservists firing on the ville?
Walt! - It's Delta.
they're laying down F. P.F. on the village.
it's all fucked up. - Get those guys on the net.
man, they got passed down. We have no comms with Delta.
I don't know, maybe the fucking retards will just run out of ammo.
God damn, this is gonna be a long night.
this is Assassin One. We are set.
assassin One, this is Assassin Two...
assassin One Two, this is Assassin One Three, we have local enemy entrenched 400 meters to the north. Break.
possible enemy mortar position.
north 1, 000 meters. Interrogative. - Stay in line!
are you in the position to observe and persecute the target?
assassin One Three, this is Assassin One Two.
we are static.
stand by while I roll the Godfather back.
assassin One Two out. Break break.
they all got blankets on to hide their heat signatures, right, Sergeant Colbert?
a week ago, they didn't know we could see their thermals at night.
now they're adapting.
didn't work for that guy.
get down! - No!
cease fire!
cease fucking fire, Sergeant!
sergeant!
cease fire, motherfucker! - Cease fire!
cease fire now!
cease fucking fire!
sergeant! What the fuck?
my staff Sergeant told me to engage all movement.
what are you doing? You dumb motherfucker, you realize you're shooting at Marines?
I saw an Iraqi helmet.
I got this, Corporal.
fuck.
two Actual, this is Two One.
who the fuck is shooting at us?
fuckin' L. A.P. D. cops from Delta!
they fucking love shooting Mexicans.
it was Alpha, Gabe.
alpha.
mistakes happen.
two One Actual, what's your status?
everyone likes to shoot Mexicans, even Mexicans.
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
this is accurate mortar fire. Request permission to egress.
negative. Our orders are to hold our position.
we're blocking for Alpha. Over.
there's a fuckin' braindead idea. - That's a hold.
we're covering Alpha's assault.
check out the retard cas-evacing lamb chops.
man, that's fucking intense when you think about it, homes.
here's this poor farmer who's out there...
shut the fuck up.
fucking fish in a barrel.
same motherfuckers who tried to smoke your ass.
... the most dramatic pictures are showing
american Marines in Baghdad city center pulling down a giant statue of Saddam Hussein.
fighting seems to have come to an end...
turn that shit off. - All right, fine.
apparently, these motherfuckers up here don't listen to the BBC.
no talking, no radio. Jeez, Brad.
grab the mag.
how about this guy over here? - No, man, over here, J. J.
Bobby, use my camera too, man. - Damn!

captain, sir... sir, what are you...
sir. Intimidation tactic.
sir, we got this situation under control.
fuck! Fuck! - Bombs!
we got a live one, men!
cover him, Redman.

I'm sorry I shook your hand. You abused that prisoner.
Bravo Two, stay on line.

looks like you won some hearts and minds, sir.
and some tongue.
check it out! We got their colors!
Yeah!
I love killing people!
please, I'm a very low soldier. - Fuck that.
you were waiting to kill us.
you didn't put your weapon down.
I'm afraid if we put our weapons down, the police will come and beat us.
everybody under Saddam is silent.
if he say we go to war with America, we say "good.
if he say we don't go to war with America, we say "good.
shit yeah.
we can't drop our weapons either. - We got orders.
next stop is Baghdad. - Sweet, man.
I don't want any war crimes in the back of my truck. Untie his hands.
give him some water.

how can I go home?
my sergeant, he sees me, - he find out I didn't fight. - Negro, ain't no Saddam.

we got ambushed all the way up here.
there still could be some bad guys who want to play.
God damn it, Ray.
no country music.
okay?
dude, it's not a country song, it's a cowboy song.
I hate to break it to you, Ray, but there are no cowboys.

because...
I'm really a spy. 20 Miles north of DMZ October 10, 2003, 01: 47 A.M

excuse me, sir
Mu-soon no word from Comrade KIM?
nothing.
I don't even know if he's alive
Oh, I forgot I Ieft my wallet at home. - You pay for this. - Me?
I don't have any shots
if you say so
Hello?
what are you doing?
you told me to shoot
who told you to shoot a gun?
you said you don't have a shot and told me to shoot
when did I tell you to make a hole in the head
I meant to pay money, okay?
are you from another planet or something?
put that thing away!
let me tell you
this is pretty good
it's junk food
I sell them for a Iiving now. - I don't want it. - It won't kill you
I ate nothing but junk food when I was your age
by the way...
how much did KIM run with?
a good 50 thousand won
bastard!
I'm meeting the family tomorrow
they might know something
you have another family?
not that family!
I meant agents, fool
Oh, okay
what a picture!
now you bring chicks home?
who's this?
a spy. - A spy?

why would a hottie Iike this be a freaking spy?
have you gone insane?
you think she's my Iover then?
tell her who you are 'Red azalea blooms on Peony Peak.'
fine!
shut up
I miss the old days
tell me about it
we were better-off back then
now we don't have any fringe benefits
aII I got Ieft over the years is...
arthritis that hurts Iike hell when it rains
Mu-soon, aren't we climbing?
we will. Where's the fire?
the mountain will still be there
everybody feels down
why don't you sing for us?
I can tell you're a good singer from your fat Iips. - Yeah, go ahead. - Come on. From Mt. Baekdu to Mt. Halla We are one country Divided in half How much we have wept Take care, my friend Goodbye, my friend Voices carrying tears We will meet again
you saw him?
Yeah.
he had a black suit on carrying a briefcase
I didn't recognize him at first
but it was KIM, all right
I think he's gone sour
so I decided to stake out a building where he often visited
I had waited for hours
right then...!
welcome to Burger King!
we're very well organized
don't try to find out who my boss is
we just do our thing
are you okay?
pIease Ieave me alone
a communicator?
I need to make a report
I'm positive KIM has sold himself out
I need a communicator now
Where'd I put it?
I haven't used it for so Iong
spies don't use that anymore
right, there's the E-mail. That would be easier
spies don't use that
let me see where did I put it
Oh, I might have sold it
how could you do that?
have you forgotten your duty to reunify the nation?
you're green and completely clueless
it's not something you can achieve in a day
take one step at a time
and reunification will come eventually
we're to build the road to reunification!
what are we, bulldozers?
get inside and clean!
answer the damn phone!
Hello?
huh?
who's this?
this is me
that was Corny!
put dad on the phone
your daddy? What's his name?
I'm out of damn coins!
it's PARK Mu-soon, bitch!
Oh, you must be Hyo-Jin
what the... How do you know my name?
your dad told me about you
he's not home now
only daughter is on the run from Ioan sharks
and he's hired a maid?
that junk food business is going well, I see
tell him I called, okay?
if you don't I'II kick your ass Iater!
if she called why didn't you persuade her to come home?
she said what she had to say and hung up on me
she's such a headache!
forget KIM
kill those Ioan sharks instead
Yeah, kill them all!
tell her to quit if she's going to work Iike that
your usual?
schoolgirl, why do you always order the biggest and the cheapest?
I'm not a schoolgirl
then, a jobless?
this could be your Iucky day
why don't you work here?
how about $2. 51 an hour?
that's great
catch KIM and make money at the same time. Two birds!
what if it reveals my cover?
so naive!
who would imagine you're a N.Korean spy?
that's true. I don't have ID, though
didn't they make one for you?
they told me you would
what am I a public servant?
whether North or South, public officials are all same!
your father is PARK Mu-soon and mother is OH Mi-Ja
the part timers working here are called the Crew
I'm in charge of the crew all the part timers
I'm also the Angel
what are you doing?
when they want it to go charge them 1 0 more cents
if they bring back cups reimburse them 1 0 cents
got it?
too many things at a time it's kind of confusing
if you're too stupid, quit now
keep waiting for the man
how'd you know that?
you can't fool me
I know you got a job here so you can meet him
does she know about me?
who could it be?
you'd better find out who did this, otherwise...
what?
we'II be called back home and sent to the mines. There goes our Iife
who runs this website?
what are you doing?
maybe we could find out who this person is
an answer maybe to my question
thanks to your fans, sales have skyrocketed
if you welcome customers with a s bright mile you will also have fans Iike Hyo-Jin
aIways keep that in mind.
let's give her a big hand!
anything to say?

funny name, isn't it?
my father Ioves climbing
you know, Mt. Everest is 8, 848 meters high
in English, my name means 'the highest peak.'
he named me after that
my father, after he saw me grab a pencil on my first birthday
he had high expectations for me
he was so disappointed when I failed the SAT
this is weird
I'm usually very shy with girls

Hyo-Jin! You made the paper!
those who don't know here are N. Korean spies!
those who don't know her are N. Korean spies!
they read the paper too
a submarine is coming to take you home
how are you?
Hey, Hyo-Jin
I saw the paper. You Iook absolutely gorgeous
I'II have it Iaminated
Hyo-Jin, you'II be better after the movie
I heard it was hilarious
it's a comedy
teenage GIRL: I was in seventh grade...
when I realized I was invisible.
well, not that kind of invisible.
no, it was more like I was just, you know, kind of...
anonymous. A-N-O-N
anonymous.
male MODERATOR: I'm sorry. That's wrong.
W-O-R-N-G. Wrong.
teenage GIRL: It's not that I didn't try.
I mean, I was always a real...
loser.
L-O-S-E-R. Loser.
male TEACHER: Homework for tomorrow...
of course, when it came to love...
pass it on.
Yeah. That sucked.
S-U-C-K-E-D. Sucked.
there was another thing working against me.
Hi.
Hey. I'm Justin. I live just next door...
and, uh, my mom sent me over...
with these brownies or something.
Oh, hi. I'm Kate. W-We just moved here.
I mean, duh- the boxes and everything...
Kate: That other thing is... my mom.
Hi. I'm Lori.
um... I made these for you.
be careful; you're hot. I mean...
they're hot.
so hot.
she's never had any trouble landing men.
she's just had trouble keeping them.
I used to keep track, but I found it exhausting.
so, I just call 'em all... Skip.
Hi, Kate.
I'm going... to be... your new... father.
Kate: Maybe we shouldn't...
get ahead of ourselves now, Skip.
it's, uh, it's Steve, kiddo.
why do you keep calling me Skip?
Kate: Because, eventually...
that's what they all do.
it's happened so many times that my mom's developed...
a very mature reaction.
a quick therapy session... or two... or three...
and then we pack up the car and flee to another town.
okay, maybe being invisible does have its advantages.
LORl: Excuse me!
because, moving all the time...
I never had to deal with the whole "awkward good-bye" thing.
boy: All right, guys, here we go.
girl: I'm open!
Kate: There's me.
it wasn't easy, but in just a few short months...
I went from "sort of unknown"to...
are you a narc?
Kate: But enough about me.
this story isn't even about me.
it's about him.
Kate: Let's face it. He is the man.
captain of the basketball team, his family's loaded...
and he looks somewhere between an Abercrombie model...
and a Greek god.
let's go, John! Kill the Bobcats!
not real bobcats. I mean, they're endangered.
girl: This is Carrie Schaefer.
it's no question who's taking the Kodiaks to State this year.
John Tucker here, also known as "Tuck..."
...some people call me "T-Money..."
but I'm best known as "El Capitan."
boy 2: Shake it, baby!
short skirts equals talent. Yay.
Heather's hot!
- Go, Kodiaks!
cheerleaders: Go Kodiaks!
Hey. Table six.
Kate: I remember the first time...
I spoke to John Tucker.
it's not like he blew me away or anything.
I mean, I was totally in control.
Hi. - Yes.
I mean... no.
l-I mean, y...
I'm... not quite ready to order.
Thanks.
Kate: Please tell me I did not just curtsy.
what was I thinking?
of course a guy like that already has a girlfriend.
that's Carrie Shaeffer.
runs the school TV station...
not to mention the Honor Society...
junior Achievers, 4-H Club...
future Filmmakers of America, Big Sisters...
Adopt-A-Shut-In, and... I think that's it.
I've decided to write a children's book.
Kate: Oh, and she's writing a children's book.
Mm! You are so sexy when you speak French.
Mm...
uh, do you guys... want a minute?
Kate: Whoa, scratch that.
he's got two girlfriends.
that one's Heather, head cheerleader.
sort of self-explanatory.
and Molly's all...
why don't we "Stomp, Fight, Roar"?
stomp, Fight, Roar?
I know!
I mean, at halftime? What a dud.
two green salads, dressing on the side.
salmon for her. Lobster for me.
I love when you do that.
I love doing that.
I love that you love that I love you doing that.
and... no need to rush between courses.
that top... Iooks so hot on you.
I bet it's even hotter off of you.
John: Never been here before, babe...
so I hope they have good vegetarian.
Kate: Okay, stop it already.
three girlfriends?
John: Oh, no! Veal?
I'm sorry. Let's just go.
you know, if I wanted to torture animals...
I'd go to a medical lab.
Hey.
I would never do, 'cause they... torture animals.
Kate: Okay, I'm not passing judgment...
but, for whatever reason...
being a vegan teen activist is usually code for "easy."
you know, for you, I don't have to give up all meat.
Kate: See? I'm not making this stuff up.
Kate: I don't get it.
I mean, these girls all seem so confident and cool.
how do they not know...
that John's cheating on all of them?
he's a total operator.
he goes out with girls from different cliques...
so that they never actually talk to each other.
and then he tells them that his father...
won't let him date during basketball season...
so they'll have to keep it a secret.
how'd you learn all this stuff?
: I don't know. Just a guess.
Hey, there he is. - Yo, bro.
he did? - Yeah, totally.
hold on, one second.
Hey. Yeah, actually...
John: What's up, fellas?
what's up, man?
yo, Tuck!
agua, please? And some popcorn.
what's up, girl?
Hey.
lookin' good.
girl: Hey, Johnny.
Hey.
Hey.
John: You got something sweet for me?
of course.
I don't know.
Kate: John was confident...
in his system for juggling girls...
but even he couldn't anticipate the events of Black Tuesday.
- GI RL: Oh, my gosh!
coach Claypoole! Are you all right?
Kate: How was he to know...
coach Claypoole had acute angina?
it wasn't John's fault.
it was a pre-existing condition, and she stabilized...
and took early retirement in Sun City, Florida.
Kate: Anyway, the point is...
coach Claypoole is in the hospital...
so we're combining all first period gym classes.
Yeah, yeah, I know. We all hate each other.
GI RL: No, we hate you.
okay. Jennifer, Alison, Molly...
Sarah, Denise and Kimmi, this side!
my name is Lucretia!
on this side, I want Beth, Carrie, Heather and...
what's-your-face.
I'm Kate. Kate.
all right, ladies... let's play ball!
you're Heather, right? I'm Kate.
so?
you weren't at the party last night. Where were you?
well, this is totally on the DL. I mean, not fit to print.
I'm dating... John Tucker.
Hey!
sorry. It slipped.
okay. All right. I'm fine.
okay, everybody. Let's play.
you know what?
that was no accident!
he's mine! Stay away from him!
Oh, you little brat!
Oh! Girls! Peace and love! Come on!
no guy is worth fighting over! Stop!
there's nothing to fight about!
John Tucker's mine!
Oh!
what the hell is your problem?
I am dating John Tucker.
enough!
girl: She knocked her out.
let's get back in the game.
I said, "Enough!" Stop it, Beth.
CARRIE: Darn it, Coach. Let me at her!
just let me get them! - Put those balls down!
put those balls down! Put down those balls!
coach: Just stop!
this guy is cheating on all of you...
and instead of taking it out on him...
you're beating the shit out of each other?!
coach: Language!
detention. You, you, you and you!
honestly.
who is that?
I don't know. Pam... something.
uh...
sorry, it's, uh...
cheap Trick. I understand.
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
Yeah, you can't really hum to Cheap Trick.
no, once you've started...
you're kind of obligated to... to belt it out.
: Yeah.
I'm Scott.
you're from... Chemistry, right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm-I'm Kate.
so, um, where is everybody?
detention?
you-you came early to detention?
Oh, um, well, it's, you know...
I would hate to m-m-miss a minute...
of being... detained.
John: Hey, babe.
girl: Hey, John.
I had a great time with these two on the beach.
ugh...
that's not, uh, usually the reaction he gets from girls.
it's generally more like a...
: Yeah, okay.
jerk isn't really my type.
Yeah, you're right.
he can have his jerk moments.
Oh. I thought he was you guys'... god, or whatever.
you're close. He's my older brother.
Oh. You're the other Tucker?
what is that? Is that, like, "the loser Tucker"?
Oh, no, no. That's not what I meant.
I just... you just don't look...
hot, buff, or capable of inciting an all-girl smackdown?
no, you're right.
Naw, it's-it's cool.
I'll let you in on a secret, though.
my mom...
says I'm special on the inside.
good for you.
Yeah.
John? Can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, sure.
later, guys.
boy: Later, man.
so, what's up?
in PE today, some loser said that she went out with you.
Really? And you believed her.
no, I mean, I don't know.
you can't have a girlfriend...
...in basketball season.
but...
if I could... you know who it'd be.
you know, I don't know why girls say stuff like that.
I mean, I think they're just...
jealous of what we have.
because we share something special.
something we don't have to label.
you know, it's... it's an unspoken bond.
and I love how secure you are.
man: All right.
detention has begun.
I'll be right back.
and no talking!
so, I talked to John.
it was sweet.
he felt bad for you.
he said that you were jealous because...
we share something special.
something that...
we didn't have to label because it's...
BETH: Because it's our unspoken bond...
and I just love how secure you are?
and it hurts me to hear you question it?
because you're the...
Carrie, HEATHER & BETH: ...only girl for me?!
Heather: Damn!
he said the same thing to all of us.
figures. He makes up with us...
and then he hooks up with us...
: you guys hooked up?
John and I share something special.
Oh, what, that you've both been in your pants?
we share a vegan/nonviolent outlook on life.
: hippie slut.
BETH: Oh, nice, Heather.
it's not like everyone doesn't know...
that Little Miss Cheerleader brings it on.
John and I belong together.
he is the team captain, and I am...
the head cheerleader.
BETH: Oh, I'm sorry...
what kind of cheerleader?
Oh, like he'd take either of you two seriously!
do not lump me with her! - Oh, so, what...
now you're better than me? - Shut up.
sorry. S-Sorry.
you have something to say?
uh...
no, it's none of my business.
what?
okay, let me guess.
does he always use pet names like "baby..."
and "sweetheart"?
Yeah, it's not out of affection.
it's so he won't mix up your names.
and-and he's all about an unspoken bond...
or something special, but never about a relationship.
a-and the whole arrangement was your idea...
so you feel guilty that he cheated.
Oh, my God. You're dating John, too.
no, uh...
no. I just knew a guy like him.
skip.
she's right. I mean, he's always making me feel guilty.
that if a guy treats you like that, it...
you'd break up with him. Blah-blah-blah-blah.
John would have another girlfriend in a second.
no, I didn't say, "break up."
I'd get even.
who are you?
BETH: I know!
you're that girl who wigged out last year and got sent to rehab!
no, I...
then you got taken away for bulimia.
no. - Fat camp?
no. My name's... - Hey! No talking!
my name is... - No... talking!
LORl: Hey, honey!
I'm in a hurry.
I've got a... big date tonight.
drummer?
doctor.
well, veterinarian.
technician.
so you're dating a dog nurse.
you've... got a friend at the door.
What?!
LORl: Have fun, girls!
Kate, right?
Yeah. Kate.
I wanna bring down you-know-who.
normally I'm opposed to the slaughter of animals...
but in John Tucker's case, I'll make an exception.
Kate: I don't even know him.
BETH: So? You don't know anyone.
you're like the Swiss. You're neutered.
uh, it's neutral. Kate, if the three of us...
tried this alone, we would kill each other.
you brought us here. You showed us that we have...
something in common.
exactly. We all wanna killJohn Tucker.
okay.
BETH: Learning Center?
who knew this was here?
look at him, struttin' his stuff like he owns the place.
BETH: Well, he does.
CARRIE: For now.
this way.
don't touch anything.
you spend way too much time in after-school programs.
thank you.
Beth, can you get the lights?
it's the remote... labeled "lights."
okay, guys. Let's go.
please try and pay attention, and all cell phones off.
Kate... do your thing.
my thing? Oh, okay.
what... is it that attracted you to John?
Kate, I like where you're going with this.
okay, girls, we need to define John.
he's a statue wrapped in a painting...
in a frame made of muscles.
but what makes him tick?
is it that charm? Is it that smile?
is it that perfect tan?
what is it, girls? Dig deep.
it's everything.
it's his eyes...
his lips, his chest, the...
the way that, when he holds you...
his whole body kinda tightens...
uh, we all know what happens when boys get happy.
not what I meant!
you guys, save it for John, okay?
look, back to the point. We all agree he's hot.
so, what do we do?
well, in cheer, we usually tear down the other team...
by undermining their confidence, makin' 'em feel lame.
I don't think this is a case for...
U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi.
shut up.
Heather, as much as I hate to admit this... you have a point.
Kate: Right.
and-and since John's game is that he always has a date...
to get even with a guy like that, you make him... undatable.
Yes.
- Undatable.
a systematic destruction...
of all that is John Tucker.
girls... I think I have an idea.
I'm telling you, babe...
you could make your looks work for you.
don't you think, Robert?
you know, Robert knows my mom...
and he shoots for Vogue, Elle, GQ.
and of course he's done...
all my yearbook photos since middle school on recycled paper.
Robert: Okay, John.
the trick is just relax...
and behave naturally, yeah?
now pout for me, John! Pout!
more pouting, yeah! Oh, yeah, I love you.
I love you. Now make me hate you!
hate me! Yeah! Oh, yeah!
Oh, you hate me! Oh, you hate me, John!
nice, nice, nice! Now you're a tree.
it's windy. Shake your branches!
big storm, John. - It's good.
big storm. Bigger, bigger, bigger.
now hate me, John.
hate me.
Oh, you hate me, John!
it is so amazing that you're into sculpture.
I mean, what are human beings here for if not to, you know...
make... horses and stuff out of clay?
Really? I'm so glad you feel that way.
totally.
girl: Hey, isn't that you?
I do some part-time male modeling.
Really? - Yeah.
I didn't know that.
John: Can I have a sip? - Yeah.
woman: I know that guy!
What?! No, I...
I don't have that.
Holly... l-l-I don't have that!
God, ooh. Don't touch me.
don't touch me. Don't touch me. - Holly, wait!
woman: That's him!
what? No, that's not real.
I only model as a guy with herpes.
man: Goin' to the free clinic, Tuck?
Kate: Rule #1 in warfare:
never underestimate your opponent.
girl: Oh, I love you, Tucker!
I don't personally suffer from an STD...
but one in five young adults do.
and I am proud to give my voice to the silent.
that's right, baby!
- Thanks!
okay, it should've worked.
I mean, are we missing something?
I am. My social life. - LORl: Hey!
Hey, Ms. Spencer.
Lori, please.
so, what are you girls up to?
destroying a man. - Ooh, who do I make my check out to?
Heather: He's totally indestructible.
we give him herpes, they give him an award.
fake herpes, Mom. N...
it was a whole reputation thing.
it's a long story.
sure. Yeah, the old " fake herpes, reputation..." thing.
you know, um...
I can unpack the groceries if you've got... stuff.
I get it. All right.
play nice, girls. Hmm.
okay, your mom is so hot!
she does Yogalates.
Carrie, what are you always typing on there?
Oh, lists... normal stuff, same as everyone.
I have my "To Do" list, my "Goals" list...
my "Contingency" list, my "Observations..."
my "Notions," which, of course, are very different...
because "Observations" require a topic sentence...
and "Notions" do not.
normal stuff.
right. Normal.
BETH: Totally.
well, at least I'm not medicated.
excuse me. This is an all-natural beauty supplement.
what are you taking?
Estrogen? Heather!
they torture innocent horses for this.
it's made from their pee.
peeing isn't torture. Menopause is.
I steal it from my mom.
guys take steroids to get pecs.
I just wanna go up a cup size.
Kate: I don't think it works like that.
it stops your natural hormone production.
Yeah, and when you run out...
you're gonna grow a mustache and a penis.
are you serious?
okay, you guys, we've gotta get back toJohn.
okay. What we need is one major hit...
that's gonna crush his whole macho thing, you know?
we need him to understand what it feels like to be us.
Kate: Right.
and what's more terrifying to a man than...
not being manly?
coach: I wanna see a three-man weave from center.
two hands, Matt.
you, too, Chris.
all right, keep it goin' now!
player: All right, here we go.
coach: Alex, you, too. Come on. Pick it up.
coach: Better, Tucker.
take a drink, you guys.
what's up, babe?
how you doin'?
good.
um, are you tryin' to bulk up?
Yeah. Coach has me drinkin' 'em twice a day.
Oh... not working.
I mean, the slim look works for some guys, but...
you're definitely losing tone.
I'm losing tone?
Yeah. Maybe you should double up doses.
Yeah. Maybe you should double up doses.
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for the heads-up, babe.
Hey, can I ask you a favor?
uh, I'm-I'm in need of a lab partner.
I was with Alex, but...
he got burnt pretty badly in an experiment, so...
Oh. Well, before I say yes...
how exactly did he get burned?
uh, well, that is open to interpretation...
because he will say that it was my fault, but I clearly said...
dear God, man, you're on fire.
run for your life.
a clear warning.
Yeah.
okay. Well, uh, you can start by measuring...
40 milliliters into that graduated cylinder.
all right.
whoa. Slow down.
huh? All right.
get down at eye level.
and wait till the bottom of the meniscus is at that line.
I'm-I'm sorry. The meniscus?
wait till the curvy part is at the doodad.
all right.
slowly.
stop right... there.
Oh, God! I...
Oh, my gosh!
shit, I spilled it! What do I do? What is this?
sodium chloride suspension. - Oh, God. I have to get...
ow, it's burning. - Really?
cause, uh, sodium chloride is... saltwater.
Ah, it's burning!
Oh. Well, okay.
then I didn't burn myself.
it just kinda... Iooks like I peed.
- Hey!
Hey, all right. All right. This is just silly!
this is...
teacher: Hey! Cool it.
Scott: Yeah, Kate.
geez, cool it.
what?
lay off. That's sensitive.
I'm sorry, princess.
did you chip a nail? Really, how many times do I...
have to flush before you go away?
play clean.
Hey, if I wanted to listen to an asshole, I would've farted.
that's an awful thing to say.
referee: We got a technical foul: 23 with a push.
he started it. He's bein' mean.
dude, that's mine! I got low blood sugar!
I need it.
do my thighs look fat in these shorts?
fans: De-fense! De-fense!
come on, John!
what? Why are you lookin' at me like that?
I'm open!
fine!
you see? Now look what you made me do.
time, ref.
John, you okay?
Yeah. Why? Don't I look okay?
cause I feel okay. I feel fine.
I'm great. What are you saying?
I'm saying focus.
we got one minute left on the clock to finish this game.
I'm in it.
on three. One-two-three...
all: Kodiaks!
Tucker. Tucker, are you okay?
can you finish the game?
no.
: L-l-I'm anxious and bloated...
and... my nipples hurt.
don't be a pansy-ass!
we need ya. Get up. Let's go.
No! I won't!
I mean, i-i-it's always me.
w-w-we need you, John. Let's go, John.
you're always yelling at me...
but you never listen to me.
what about my feelings?
Kate: It was a kill-strike...
John: Leave me alone!
...and it landed with shock and awe.
thanks to us, girls would no longer be...
under the reign ofJohn Tucker's charm.
he had finally fallen from grace...
and we were on top of the world.
girl: Bye, guys!
yo, what's up, guys?
what you did on the court last night...
was the most courageous thing I've ever seen any man do.
this is my peer-counseling hotline.
give it a call anytime you want to talk.
I stay up late.
a real man knows how to feel.
I want to feel a real man.
if you ever need a shoulder or a hug or, you know...
anything... I'm here.
Kate: Rule #2 in warfare:
never, ever, underestimate your opponent.
Hey, sweetie. Can we talk?
look... I know I wigged out last night.
my peer counselor says I need to look into...
my emotional responsibility.
so, I've been doing some "me" work...
and, uh, it's really been clearing things up.
and, well, you know there's only one girl for me.
but... I don't think that girl is you.
I mean, we had a fun run.
you know? I'm just ready to find...
something deeper, more complex.
so... we good?
well... he dumped me.
that shallow bastard thinks I'm not complex?
you, like, invented complex.
I'm so depressed, I couldn't even enjoy the break-up sex.
Oh, my God, I'm such a slut!
- Oh, God!
I can't believe I ate meat for him.
I mean, it was fish...
still, I don't eat anything with a face.
mm, try this. It's really good.
chocolate on chocolate.
Oh, yeah.
chocolate is theJohn Tucker... of all snack food.
what, it's gotta get with every candy on the shelf?
no, no, no, chocolate makes everything better.
my mom says that it can even mend your broken heart.
you know, I was thinking...
instead of doing all this...
we should've just broken his heart.
what?
Heather, that's pretty genius.
Yeah, except he broke up with everybody.
not... everybody.
what? I...
no. - Mm-hmm.
I can't do that.
I don't even like him. - So?
you're not really gonna be dating him.
you'll be pretending.
exactly.
look, I know what you're thinking.
I'm not as pretty as Heather.
I'm not that smart.
I'm not that...
experienced.
: that's true.
but you have us.
and we can make you into anything. If we combine...
all of us, we can make him fall in love with you.
I mean really fall in love- and then we'll...
yank it all out from under him.
this is gonna be so good!
no, it's just not gonna work. I...
Kate, look...
I know you think I'm just a superficial cheerleader...
but... I do have feelings...
and they got crushed because of your idea.
I used all my mom's estrogen pills...
: sorry.
you guys, I...
you know what? Forget it.
you couldn't pull it off anyway.
let's go.
CARRIE: Oh, well.
Kate: Wait.
just tell me what to do.
Yes! - Oh!
- Ha!
Heather: Now, the first step is so easy.
there's one thing John Tucker cannot resist.
okay, girls. This is Kate...
and she'll be taking Nancy's spot.
what? - Well, you know, you've...
got that bum leg and everything. Sorry!
but it's just a sprain.
the doctor said I'd be better in a week.
maybe next year, kiddo. You fought a good fight, though.
okay, pyramid! Kate, you're on top.
what? No, no, no. I get dizzy in high heels.
come on!
John loves girls on top.
of the pyramid! Hello!
trust me, it's an honor.
Molly's been waiting three years to get up there.
right, Molly?
Yeah, you go ahead.
it's your first day. You earned it.
okay. Up-up-up!
good.
straight legs.
nice and steady.
big smile!
I did it!
Kodiaks, attack!
Kate: Sorry.
well, if you can crush John like you crushed Molly...
I think we got it.
don't be sorry. Be strong.
the most important thing a cheerleader wears...
is her attitude.
watch this.
boy: That is hot!
I can do that.
boy: Hey, how you doin'?
Heather... we're cool, right?
what?
who's the new cheerleader?
that's Kate.
she's cute.
not gonna happen.
she's not into high school boys.
Kate: That's it?
we just planted the seed.
What'd he say about me? Did he say anything?
cute.
he said that? He really did?
uh, oh, my gosh. L-I mean...
you didn't even introduce me.
should I go talk to him?
L-I'll go... No?
okay, emergency meeting.
I think we're sending Kate in before she's ready.
I... I'm totally ready.
Really? Tell 'em what John said about you.
Oh, what, about me being cute?
Oh. No, it's just a comment.
if anything, it's an insult.
I know he's just getting ready to use me.
Kate, I'm confused, but I thought you said...
you had experience with guys like this.
I do. L-I've watched my mom date a million and one of these guys.
but have you ever dated one?
have you ever dated a John Tucker?
have you ever dated... anyone?
define "anyone."
Oh, my God! I'm totally not ready! I'm gonna blow this...
no, no, no, no. You're gonna be fine.
all right, stop. Stop.
okay, look, you'll be fine, okay?
you just gotta remember to be cool and... collected.
Yeah. Be caring and passionate.
be proud and... aggressive.
you've got to make him chase you, okay?
if it's easy...
he'll move on.
do you understand?
Mm-hmm. Yes, l-I have it.
it's totally under control.
okay.
so... he really said you were cute?
Yeah. I mean, that's what Heather said, and... Damn it!
okay, okay, look.
it's not that hard. Um...
when he speaks to you...
count to three...in your head before you answer him.
don't show any interest. Don't even look at him too much.
hm. - CARRIE: Yeah, no.
you got it?
I said do you have it?
not that slowly.
we don't want him to think you're retarded.
um... sorry.
it's my bad.
so... you must be new.
well, not "new" new, but...
new to cheer.
okay, don't tell me.
tell me Friday night... at dinner.
I'm captain of the team. You're our new cheerleader.
I'm obligated to buy you dinner. School rules.
thank you, but I'm gonna have to pass.
you busy, or?
sure. I'm busy. Nice to meet you. Bye.
: what?
uh... you know, there's actually...
a pretty decent music scene around here.
you know, if I ever know...
you know, I mean, if I... ever hear of a good show...
I could maybe... you know, I could...
I could let you know...
about that show.
teacher: Where are you supposed to be?
you don't belong in this class.
l-I'm just supposed to drop these off.
Thanks.
uh, excuse me? Who are you?
what's going on h... What is your name, son?
John: Attention, fellow students.
if Kate is out there in Loudspeaker Land, my number is...
girl: Give me a pen.
I'm the captain of the team.
you're our new cheerleader.
I'm obligated to buy you dinner. School rules.
Kate: Thank you, but I'm gonna have to pass.
uh, how'd you guys get this video?
I've been documenting our efforts.
great! Make a video.
maybe John'll get a role on The O. C.
it's our expose.
we're gonna show everybody the real John Tucker.
and how we broke his... heart.
Heather: It'll be like...
prime Time Tucker.
hasta la vista, motherf...
CARRIE: Stop...
with the rhyming.
BETH: Now, that's good.
do it like this.
John... - JOHN: Hey, sweetie.
there's only one guy out there for me...
I just don't think that girl is you.
both: And you are not... - Not him!
we good?
we are so gonna neuter him!
Kate, do one. - Uh...
John, there's only one guy out there for me.
how do you want to be a cheerleader...
with no attitude?
I... don't want to be a cheerleader.
everyone wants to be a cheerleader.
come on, you got to sell it!
there's only one guy out there for me...
- But you are not him.
no.
Kate, this is for every guy out there...that's ever lied to any girl.
okay?
: okay, action.
but you are not him.
damn. You are gonna be a legend.
BETH: Yeah.
did you like the flowers?
uh, yeah, if you're... into that sort of thing.
cause... I didn't get a phone call.
I didn't have a pen.
scrappy! - Oh!
Hey, man. - Hey.
you talk. What's her deal?
Yeah, I don't know, man.
I don't think she's your type, though.
girl" is my type.
- All right, well...
then-then maybe, uh, you're not her type.
she's into stuff like...
old-school Elvis Costello; she listens...
to obscure podcasts;
she reads Dave Eggers.
you know, she's... she's deep, man.
dude... I'm deep.
I'm dating the Poetry Club.
: Oh.
Kate: So, John asked you to spy on me?
Yeah, he heard we were lab partners...
so he's having me tail you and find out what I can.
although, I am supposed to be playing it cool...
and not giving anything away.
you're, like, the worst spy in the world.
or am I the best spy in the world?
who's waiting by the phone, and who's chatting up the girl?
that's true. - Eh?
I have a kink. I have a kink in my neck.
that's probably those new cheer muscles of yours.
are you making fun of me?
uh, a little bit, yeah.
um... sorry.
Yeah, uh... - All right.
these are your books. - Yeah.
I'm gonna go.
go, Fight, Roar.
Yeah. Right. Yeah.
Bye.
: shit.
cheerleaders: Here we go, Kodiaks. Here we go!
Yeah, baby!
cheerleaders: Defense!
Hey, I think I totally blew it with John.
I mean, he hasn't even looked at me since I turned him down.
relax. Kate, this is going to work. I promise.
h-how do you know?
I just know. I promise.
how you doing?
good. How are you?
not so good.
see, I like this girl, but she doesn't know I exist.
Tucker! Get in the game!
I'm baring my soul, here, Coach.
what are you doing here? - There's somethingyou need to know.
I need your help. you've got to find that book.
that book, it's special.
it shouldn't end up in the wrong hands.
the book is the one common thread. I mean, my dream, the thief.
the book is the key to everything.
the book is always changing--new things are written, old things are erased.
I know this is about our baby, I just know it.
will my son be able to do what I do?
no.
he'll be able to do much, much more.
I looked at the book last night.
and there was something really scary.
september 25th.
my due date.
OK.
Ah, you changed the sheets.
Yeah. They get dusty.
in one day?
I think you need to get something to eat.
OK.
thank you for painting the room again.
no, you were right, honey.
the blue is better.
it's calmer.
I miss the yellow.
don't. You're perfect.
it's perfect. I'm just... - Yeah.
Oh, i'm grumpy.
no. - moody.
that's what I am, just a big, crazy, pregnant, moody lady. and you have exams.
it's nothing. It's fine.
no, med school is nothing? It's huge.
OK, and then you've cooked.
you exchanged the crib! The new one's so much better, by the way.
I mean, you've done such--you couldn't have gotten my car fixed?
remember, they had to order the part.
Yeah, but did you tell them that we're stuck with your truck?
your ancient, unreliable truck?
I mean, did you tell them that this is an emergency?
what emergency? - This could be an emergency.
look, I know that it's your due date, what the watchers predicted,
but you're not gonna have a baby tonight, cause it's after 8: 00.
it's the book of changes, ok? Not the watchers,
and they've been right about everything else.
Ok...do you really want them to be right about this?
I want to be prepared.
easy... - I got it.
let's go.
how are you holding up?
16 laps, no progress. - got it.
it hurts, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can. You have to!
Hey, honey. The doctor's here. We should go through there.
thank you for not treating me like I'm crazy.
it's just a feeling, you know?
it doesn't sound like you're in labor,
but we'll just make sure everything's ok.
OK.
your baby is showing signs of fetal distress.
and we need to move to an immediate delivery.
get Dr. Glass and call the O.R. now! - Jim, what's happening?
they have to get the baby out. - I need a mask. something's obstructing the blood supply.
it could be the cord.
we're going to turn you on your side. - To my side?
what's going on? Is it ok? Is everything ok?!
they're gonna get him out, Mel.
OK, well, is it ok?
Jim! - They're going to do a c-section.
Jim! - it's going to be ok. I'm right with you, Mel, I promise.
it's going to be ok.
lots of pressure, ok?
OK. Here we go.
here he comes.
we got you, little guy!
he's almost there! He's almost out!
tell me what's going to happen.
is he going to be ok?
is he going to be born this day, like the book said, because that's his fate?
fate?
you made this happen.
you and the book.
so that's how it works?
fate and free will working together?
I hope so. I'd really like to see your child live.
OK, we got 'em, we got 'em!
out of 23: 48.
you did it, Mel. You ok？ Are you all right？
his color's good.
he's not breathing.
he isn't breathing. Why isn't he breathing?
what do you mean, he's not breathing?
it's ok, honey.
what do you mean, he's not breathing? Stay with him!
I will, I will.
I'm gonna give him some breaths with a bag and a mask.
I'm gonna suction his airway again.
is he ok?
he'll be ok, they'll get him breathing.
here we go, that's the boy.- He's breathing.
he's fine, Mel. He's ok.
here's your little boy.
Hi!
I feel like I've waited my whole life just to meet you.
Hi, Dr. Chase.
you were gone a really long time. Is something wrong?
his apgar scores are normal.
he's healthy and responsive.
everything seems to be fine.
doc, is there anything you're not telling us?
when we got to him, his pulse was low,
his coloring was blue.
everything pointed to some kind of obstruction or distress.
and then, before he even breathed on his own,
his color floated back.
I've never seen anything like it.
I think somebody's ready to celebrate.
he wants to nurse.
you're not just somebody.
your name's Aiden.
honey, my dad's name? Are you sure?
Aiden Lucas.
it'll celebrate Sam, too, you know?
two people who brought us this beautiful little life.
Yeah.
that's normal.- Ok.
we're home, we're home, aiden! We're back!
we are goingto protect you.
we will always protect you.
OK.
Aiden Lucas, just because it's almost your birthday,
doesn't mean you can leave your junk in a pile.
Aiden, listen to your mother. - Ok, ok, i'm coming.
Hey! Aiden, slow down.
I want a superhero cake with five candles,
and five superheroes. No, wait, five cakes!
well, you got about five minutes to play with your dad before he goes back to the hospital.
Oh, here he comes.
mom, did you invite Declan to the party?
and Charlie and Riley and Gus?
is this what our lives have become together, little man?
one giant party?
Yes!
dad's gonna get us! He's gonna get us!
Melinda? - In the bathroom.
cross match two units of packed cells.
start an I.V. Line and get some oxygen.
Hey.
wait a minute, did you just go some place?
Or...did someone just come visit us?
it was a nurse.
she was standing right there.
you know, is it me or this happening more often these days?
Yeah. I guess in the last couple of years.
she was asking for two units of packed cells?
blood.
does she have anything to do with the ghost you're dealing with right now?
I don't think so.
but it felt familiar. - Good.
well, hopefully she won't bother us any more tonight.
Yeah, hopefully not. did you check on Aiden?
sound asleep.
here we go.
Aiden, who is that?!
Hi, daddy. - Birthday boy, how you doing? it's so good to see you!
can I start to sing it now?
dad, no, not again. - Yeah, please don't.
listen, we're early, but can you take a break?
it's the perfect time.
come on, let's go. - Ok.
we brought a lot so you can share with your friends.
Hey, I'm sorry i'm going to miss your party with your friends,
but another doctor got sick, so...
it's ok.
but next week on my day off,
I am going to come to school, i'm gonna take you out of there.
and we're gonna go out and do something cool.
whatever you want, your choice.
just us guys? - Yeah!
well, fine, if that'sthe way you two want it.
levi Kramer says he doesn't see ghosts.
he said we made them all up.
um, did he used to see them?
Yeah, but not anymore.
when I am going to stop seeing them?
do you want to stop?
do you?
sometimes.
what about you?
you know, to tell youthe truth...
I don't remember ever seeing them.
I mean, I'm sure I did.
but then, I don't know, a friend or a grown-up
probably came up to me and told me that I was imagining them.
so they lied to you?
no, I think they just didn't understand.
like people don't understand Mommy can still see 'em?
is that why we have to keep it a secret?
Hey.
does it feel bad? Having to keep it a secret?
the spirali put on that ball!
that was a bullet.
there's a lot of ghosts at your job.
can ghosts get birthday presents?
No!
she's the authority.
too bad. - Yeah, too bad.
they must have liked the cake.
is that Ned's girlfriend?
Oh, no, that's steve's daughter. she's just helping out.
besides, Ned doesn't really have time
for a girlfriend with all the coursework you give him.
uh, I have himfor one class.
and by the way, I've seen him on campus.
he makes time a plenty.
Yeah, well, so does this one.
I thought you were dating Steve.
no, at this point,
we're more of just friends.
OK, so I've met a few more people.
now tha I have all these commercial listings.
I should have got my real estate license.
is that an actual pin on that tail?
uh, no, that is velcro.
but it doesn't mean that they won't find a way to take an eye out with it.
Yeah, it's almost a toss-up, you know?
do you order an ice cream truck or an ambulance?
gosh, don't you just miss the days when they couldn't turn over?
Yeah, I definitely miss it today.
right. The birthday curse.
I don't know about that one.
haven't you ever noticed that every year it's something?
Yeah, I mean, last year,
Aiden fell out of that bouncer and needed stitches.
the year before that, I walked into the plate glass door.
Yep. And when he was two, he spiked that crazy high fever.
Yeah, well, look at him now.
Aiden's the best one.
he is so much cooler than the other kids.
even if he can't do tricks. - All right, eli.
what?
the watchers said he'd have super powers. - They said he would be powerful.
are you talking about Aiden's super powers?
OK, both of you, enough.
ready, Aiden? - Ok.
but aren't you curious? - Ready?
I mean, he's five now, and look at him.
he's just so happy and normal.
Yeah, you can imagine my concern, 'cause what mother would want a happy, normal kid?
Yeah, but this is not about what you want.
his life, his gift, may serve a larger purpose.
who's going to help me with the goodie bags?
I'm there.
come on, you guys.
Oh! Hi!
Hey, Aiden, those goodie bags are for your guests.
happy birthday to you.
happy birthday, dear Aiden.
it's ok that you don't have a present.
I have one for you.
are you ready to come with me now?
come with me.
who are you?
shouldn't you check the baby?
aiden! Aiden, baby, can you talk?!
aiden! Oh, god!
please! Please!
squeeze my hand if you still feel ok.
now remember, squeeze it twice if you feel pain anywhere.
how can she be doing this to him?
look, they're gonna run some tests on him tonight, It'll be ok.
they said that his blood pressure is normal.
and his heart is fine. - Melinda...
they're not going to find anything.
where are we?
we're at the hospital.
did we come to pick up daddy?
you don't remember anything?
did i fall asleep in the car?
no, baby.
come here.
do they really have to keep him overnight?
that's good, he'll get some sleep.
Mel, there's got to be a medical cause for this.
I'm telling you, it was the ghost, I saw her.
you see a lot of ghosts, all right?
and I've seen you experience a lot of hideous things. - Only what they've experienced.
I know, in a new vision, but then it's over and you're fine.
so is Aiden, physically.
I mean, he doesn't remember a thing.
this time.
what if it happens again?
I don't know.
I don't know who the ghost is.
does Aiden?
mom?
Hey, sweetheart.
how you doing? - Good.
Where's dad?
he's doing his rounds.
then we're all going to go to breakfast,
and your daddy's going to take you home.
OK.
and then i'm going to figure out what made you sick.
but i'm not sick.
Aiden, do you remember anything about last night,
before you fell asleep? Did you...
see someone?
you mean a ghost?
Yes.
just the lady.
the one who sings to me.
sings to you?
happy birthday.
have you seen her before?
I see her every year.
do you know who she is?
no. But she always remember my birthday.
always.
she always remembers my birthday.
how long is "always" to a little kid, do you think?
I believe him.
I mean, all the illnesses, the accidents.
every year on his birthday, something bad has happened to Aiden or Jim or me.
I think she's been there,
and i think she's been with us every year.
Yeah, but is she haunting Aiden or the whole family?
and why only on that day?
what? Five second rule.
if it is every year, how come he hasn't mentioned her until now?
cause he sees ghosts all the time.
Yeah, but they didn't affect him.
not like the way this one did.
maybe she's feeding off of his strength.
maybe she knows that he's
what, that he can see ghosts, Just like every kid his age?
Yeah, but he isn't like any other kid his age.
not according to the watchers or the book.
what about the book?
you know, we've been studying the book for years now.
Ned's practically majoring in it.
when i heard about what happened last night,
I went to the page with your name on it, the one that predicted Aiden's birth.
you know, sometimes the book of changes. Actually, uh, changes.
there's beena new entry.
it's about your son.
OK, so what does that mean for Aiden?
we don't know. but that writing, that's Latin.
it says,"When the leaves fall, so will the innocent."
but maybe the ghost is part of the prophecy.
maybe she's part of what's supposed to happen.
what, to aiden?
is that what we're really talking about right now? Cause it's not gonna happen.
and I want this ghost to stay away from my son.
OK, but we don't even know who she is.
look, the...
the clock stopped right
right before Aiden got better last night.
and it happened once before.
the night he was born.
cross match two unitsof packed cells,
start an I.V. line and get some oxygen.
the patient was losing blood.
I think she died in that hospital
the night my son was born.
11: 48 p. m.
does Jim like working here?
Yeah, he loves it.
I'm just glad we didn'thave to move for his residency.
but you feel it, too, right?
I mean, every time I treat a patient here,
as soon as I walkinto the building...
Yeah, I feel it.
lost souls, you know?
but it's a hospital.
people die here.
no, I worked in a lot of hospitals.
there's something different about this one.
this is her. Amber Heaton.
she was only 20 when shedied of an aortic rupture as a result of childbirth.
don't you dare threaten my son.
I don't have to.
it's already done.
Hi.
he's mine.
how we doin'?
better, thanks.
look, this might not be the best time to tell you,
but...well, actually, maybe it's perfect.
look, remember how I promised Aiden.
that I would take him anywhere he wanted to go，
after I missed his party?
well, look, I caved.
I told him that I would take him to Pickwick's fun factory - And bowling alley. - Pickwick's, really?
Yeah. Look, and I told him it was a once in a lifetime trip,
and I also told him never to bother you about it again.
Jim, it's fine.
it's your party.
Pickwick's is fine?
what's the matter?
the ghost.
I think she believes that her son's spirit went into Aiden.
wait, like what happened to me? Like a step-in?
it would explain why she showed Mehi's body at the morgue,
why she wrote "He's mine" in blood.
it's not so impossible, really.
I mean...they both had traumatic deliveries.
she died during childbirth.
I'm sure if we had stayed at that morguea little longer,
we would have found out that her son died, too.
Yeah, but how did he get into Aiden?
think about it.
Aiden was blue.
his heart wasn't pumping.
we don't know that he didn't die for a split second,
but long enough for her son to go in.
honey, you don't believe that, do you?
not in my heart.
no. But it would explain some things.
like, why doesn't he have super powers?
Hey, you know, you've just been talking to Eli too much.
I mean, I would love him the same, either way.
he's my son.
but I can't help but wonder that...
maybe he'd be better off if he wasn't.
Why? Why, because the book says
when the leaves fall, so will the innocent.
Jim, I'm worried.
what if I don't know what's coming?
what if I can'tprotect him?
Hello?
before I tell you what I got,
can we just take a moment to appreciate how good a friend I am?
What'd you get?
well, the moment I pictured was a little bit longer than that, but ok.
I got all the medical records on your ghost.
how? Jim asked all of his hospital contacts.
I treat people there.
I have my own system passwords.
I entered a patient name incorrectly,
like, illegally incorrectly,
which is why I thought maybe a thank you, you know, would
OK, thank you.
What'd you find out?
first of all, it's no coincidence that the ghost is attached to you.
you were right. she died in the O.R.
the delivery room next to yours.
OK. So what happened to Amber's baby? I mean, did he die?
almost. His blood supply was cut off and he coded,
but he was revived with no permanent issue or brain damage.
thank god.
OK, so then what?
then what, what?
if Amber thinks that her baby died.
and came back as Aiden, which obviously he didn't.
so where is he now?
wait, it says in his medical records that he was adopted?
they had to indicate custody.
amber was dead.
OK, do these parents have names?
no dice.
closed adoption.
OK, we got 'em, we got 'em!
out at 23: 48.
he isn't breathing. - why isn't he breathing?
Jim, stay with him, i think he's not breathing.
he's ok!
where are you?
we need to talk. - I want my baby.
you're trying to take him away from me.
I'm not trying to take anything away from you.
you told him he doesn't have to see me if he doesn't want to.
Oh, when I told him that he didn't have to see ghosts?
that's what got you upset?
I'm his mother.
a child ought to be with his mother.
you really think that you're Aiden's mother.
what makes you so sure?
there wasn't any time for pain medication,
so I still feel everything.
I was bleeding so badly.
my baby was dying inside of me.
they were racing to get him out,
but even when they got him free,
he was too weak.
he wouldn't breathe.
I kept trying to tell themto show me my son,
but they wouldn'tlet me speak.
I saw two nurses rush him away.
I couldn'tfight it anymore.
one of the nurses came back.
she said something to the other nurse.
I knew it meant my baby was dead.
I kept screaming at them to tell me what had happened,
but they couldn't hear me.
I waited to take him into the light,
but he didn't come.
and then I heard him.
he was alive.
he might have to live in another form, but my son was alive.
but you didn't see his spirit go into my son's body, did you?
I didn't have to.
that child, the one you call Aiden, he's mine.
if he's yours, then why would you hurt him?
why would you want him to suffer?
I would never do that. - But you did.
you gave himthose symptoms.
no. I didn't.
I was just watching him. I was just watching my son.
amber, there's something that you need to know.
your son's spirit didn't need another dhild's body because he didn't die.
but those nurses...
they were probably talking about you.
and what a tragedy it was that you never got to hold your son.
I don't understand. If he's still alive, where is he?
he was adopted.
that can't be. - It's true.
and it's really good news.
he went straight to the family that you chose for him. - I chose?
it was a closed adoption.
that means there was a contract. You probably agreed to it in advance.
no, that's not possible. I didn't want that.
what do you mean?
I can't do this!
Yes, you can, you have to!
was that the adoptive father?
that message was for the nurses.
you changed your mind about the adoption. You wanted to keep your baby.
they can't have him.
it's too late.
amber, he belongs to them now.
he belongs with me!
you're not going to find them.
in closed adoptions, the birth parents, adopted parents, - The records are sealed. - Well, I have to find them.
I mean, you should have seen how angry she was.
at you?
no, the adoptive father. they were arguing.
arguing? They should never have even met.
what were they arguing about?
she changed her mind. It sounded like he was threatening her.
you know, maybe he was going to take her to court.
Yeah, but don't the adoption laws protect the birth mother?
it always allows for a change of heart.
I mean,
he would not havea leg to stand on.
unless...
unless he had his own rights.
parental rights,
like the kind you would get if you were the blood father.
adopting your own kid? I mean, why would he do that?
she was 20 years old.
he looked like he was in his late thirties, I'm gonna guess married.
how did they get involved?
the ghost obit said that she was an intern at Ufland consulting.
there he is, the guy she was arguing with, Dale Harmon.
Hi, my name is Melinda Gordon.
listen, Dale's son goes to school with mine.
does he have a minute?
right, yeah, he's at Tyler's birthday party, of course.
tell him that Aiden is a guest.
right. you know, actually, We were supposed to be there,
but we lost our invite.
can you tell me where the party is?
thank you.
what? What's wrong?
they're at Pickwick's.
so? That's where Jim took Aiden. They're at the same place.
I'm so sorry, but just this once, can you watch the store?
Yes, of course. i still have my key.
but relax, Mel, that's a coincidence.
Yeah, I used to believe in coincidence.
what happened?
I read a book that changed my mind.
too bad we couldn't bowl.
Hey, you want to tell me how you got so good at air hockey all of a sudden?
what, are you sneaking down here with your mother to practice?
mommy hates this place. You know that.
dad, did you play your hardest?
Yeah, I did.
just about.
how hungry are you?
what about some birthday pizza, How do you feel about that?
what's your name?
do you know who I am?
you should know who I am.
Tyler, don't go too far.
leave me alone!
Hey, what do you want on your pizza?
what is it? Ok, look.
there you go.
want to go burn some quarters while I wait for your food?
but stay where I can see you, ok, man?
OK. - good.
hey honey, how you doing?
the couple that adopted the ghost's child is there.
they're here?
I need you to talk to them for me.
keep an eye on their son until i can get there.
but how can I tell who they are? - I can describe the dad.
the father is tall, brown hair. The son is Aiden's age.
why are you following me?
leave me alone!
why won't you leave me alone?
I thought you were dead.
don't you know me?
I'm your mommy.
no, you're not!
say that, sweetheart.
go away! I don't like you!
please don't speak to me that way.
he doesn't understand. He's just scared.
please, stop scaring him.
I'm his mother!
no, you're not!
they took him away from me!
now he hates me!
they made him hate me!
I won't let them take him.
I won't let them take him!
Mel! this is Dale and his wife Emily.
Hi. she's not here. Where's her son?
no, that's just it, we can't find him.
OK, well, what about Aiden?
no, no, it's all right. he's right over there by the...
I won't let them take him!
I won't let them take him!
I won't let them take him!
get off him!
he's mine! Don't take him away from me!
I swear, he was right by the machine.
OK, just check the kitchen.
all right, and we'll take the lanes. I'm gonna go this way.
where are they?
I'm afraid it's too late.
you can't help them.
are they in danger?
Aiden isn't, if he stays where he is.
what about Tyler?
please hear me.
just stay where you are.
OK, and make sure that Tyler stays with you.
come here! - No, I'm scared!
you're not safe there!- How do you know?
I don't know. I just know.
quick!
mommy! - Honey, are you ok?
Hey! Aiden!- Mommy!
hold on, ok? Just hold on.
are you ok? - Yeah, I'm fine.
I made Tyler stay with me, like I was supposed to.
who told you that you're supposed to?
I don't know. Did I make a mistake?
No! No, baby, you did great.
are you sure you're ok? - Yeah, I'm ok, mommy.
how are you doing?
Oh, still a little rattled. Do youhave any decaf?
Yeah, i think so.
well, the boys seem ok.
Thanks.
I think Amber's ready to talk now.
Oh, why don't I give your husband a hand with the boys?
I'm sorry about what I did in that place.
I didn't know I could do that.
she's sorry about what happened with the boys,
and she didn't know her own strength.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, too.
can you tell her why?
I'm not proud of what I did back then.
it was a hard time for me and Emily,
but that's no excuse.
so then what happened?
they were trying really hard to get pregnant, - But it wasn't working out. - My wife and I were having problems.
I'd stay late at the office
and Amber was always right there,
just ready to listen.
there was a party to celebrate landing a new client.
there was some office party, and...
I know, it's a clich?
I never thought I could do something like that.
it was one time.
one time, and I was pregnant.
I knew I had to have the baby,
but I was 20 years old.
I thought I had my whole life in front of me.
Emily, she--we--really, really wanted children.
we'd already decided to adopt when Amber came to me, pregnant.
so you thought a closed adoption would be perfect
because then your baby would have a home.
without anger or resentment,
and his wife would never know.
and then shechanged her mind.
at the last moment, I thought I could do it.
I could raise my son.
I didn't know what would happen.
I didn't know how she'd treat if she ever knew the truth.
is she here?
Yeah.
it's ok, Emily knows everything. I told he rthat night.
when the man you love, trusted,
comes to you with something like this...
it can turn your heart to stone.
unless you're holding a baby in your arms.
watching him grow...
knowing he needs you.
he needs love.
he needed us.
because the young girl who loved him and gave him life lost her own.
I saw that before.
but I felt so alone.
so scared for him.
but I know you're ok now, aren't you, sweetheart?
tell them to be good to him.
to keep loving him.
she wants you to love him.
the way that she would have.
we will.
I think we always have.
and one day when he's ready,
we'll tell himall about you.
she's gone.
Bye!-Bye!
I've got company.
I'll be inside.
OK.
so how long have you known?
known what?
how long have you known what my son can do?
you mean what you two can do together?
look, we're connected.
I've always know that somehow,
but...
the visions I've had, they've been from Aiden?
how do they come to him?
I mean, is he--is he a sensitive?
the word you're looking for is "Empath."
he can share other people's feelings,
their experiences.
that's why he's sick and then gets better.
why he turned blue and couldn't talk.
it's like he'sexperiencing something.
that somebody else has already been through somehow.
like the day he was born.
and every birthday since.
her symptoms,
she relived them, and he relived them right along with her.
and you relived some of it, too, through him.
Hi.
tea? You want a refill?
I would love a whisky sour.
sometimes I just wish you were less of a watcher and more of a talker.
I mean, people almost got hurt.
that's how we learn, all of us, living and dead.
and besides, it's the rules.
God, you have an answer for everything.
if i did...
there would be no need for us to watch, would there?
what are we going to tell him?
nothing, not about this.
you don't want him to know he's connected to you?
no.
if he did, then he'd know that his dreams aren't really his.
I want his dreams to belong to him, like any little boy.
I heard your voices.
I thought you were my dream.
no. But you're our dream.
except from the time that I was a little girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.
to tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.
andrea Melinda.
sit over there.
hello. Welcome to room 3's talent night.
tonight we're gonna start out with something special.
one of our students, Dillon Cho, has written a very imaginative play.
we hope you enjoy room 3's production of "Ghost At The Crossing."
you know what they say: "Write what you know."
I'm so bored. My dad has gone away, and my mom's too busy to even talk to me.
Hi. Wanna play?
who are you?
I'm a ghost.
no way.
wanna come to the railroad tracks?
I'm really not supposed to.
Oh, come on.
we can put pennies on the tracks and watch 'em get squished.
Melinda, help me.
scene 2: The railroad tracks.
Hey. How was work?
busy. How was the play?
spookier than I expected actually.
good for Dillon.
I haven't had a chance to look through this new training manual, so I'm just gonna go do it downstairs.
no. Stay. I can sleep with the lights on.
all right. Hey, I forgot. Your mom called this morning.
what did she want?
I don't know. She didn't say.
I'm thinking maybe it's birthday related.
well, you're not gonna plan anything, right?
we're not planning anything.
we?
me. No one. No one is. Promise.
right. 'Cause you know how I feel about it.
Yes, I do.
although I was kind of hoping this year you might be over it.
I'm not.
you ok?
Yeah. I'm just tired.
Mel, I know you have some issues with your mom.
and this birthday thing...
you wanna talk about it?
what's there to talk about?
single mother didn't do a very good job. Pretty common story.
but she raised a pretty uncommon daughter.
Yeah, that's part of the problem.
do I know you?
why didn't you help me?
who are you?
don't you know?
trouble sleeping?
Yeah.
big trouble.
we're just open. Come on in.
Hi.
do you see someone in the store?
um... customer.
besides her.
no.
it must've been Dillon's play.
I just got the weirdest feeling, like...like someone was watching me.
can a civilian catch a ghost vibe like that?
a civilian?
well, maybe, but it'd have to be a pretty powerful ghost.
excuse me. How much is this?
um, I just thought I'd wind them up.
I bet you thought they were antiques.
I can't do this. Just get in the house.
children, I have something very, very sad to tell you.
some of you may know that Sarah Applewhite has been ill this year.
this morning, her parents called to tell me that Sarah passed away last night.
I know this is kind of a shock.
so if any of you want to talk about it further, I'm here for you.
Yes, Melinda.
Mrs. Riley, Sarah's not dead.
she's standing right over there.
I wanna talk to my mom and dad.
then why don't you go talk to them?
I can't find them.
that's because you're at school. Go look in your house.
Melinda, this isn't funny.
you heard her. She can't find her parents.
why aren't you helping her?
that's enough, Melinda.
are you saying you don't see her?
I don't believe you.
if you don't stop this, I'll have to send you to Mr. Corbett.
why are you all lying? She's right in front of you.
Oh, I am so sorry.
I was in the middle of a shi, and the traffic was horrendous.
then I had to take the bridge, which made it even worse.
it's fine.
sweetie, what's wrong? Are you sick?
no. At least we don't think so.
I don't know if you've heard this, but one of Melinda's classmates has passed away.
Oh, no. Sarah Applewhite?
that's right.
Oh, sweetie. I am so sorry.
no, mom. They're wrong.
Sarah's alive. I saw her.
and nobody believes me.
she's been saying this all morning. It's upsetting her classmates.
some of the other parents have had to come down.
I'm so sorry.
well, she's just... she's just emotional.
but it's true.
we thought it might be a good idea for Melinda to go home for the day, maybe rest.
of course. You're right.
but, mommy, you have to believe me.
I am so sorry.
come on, Melinda.
mom.
mom, why won't you talk to me about Sarah?
it isn't fair.
Melinda, please stop doing this.
I suffered through years of it with my mother.
I'm not gonna go through it again.
go through what? What are you talking about?
I can't do this.
just go to your room, Melinda. Go on.
it was just amazing how it all flooded back to me, how confused I was, how scared.
I had no idea why I could see this girl and no one else could.
I thought your grandmother had told you about all this.
not until later.
my mom was so angry and embarrassed about the whole thing, she kept it a secret like we were trying to make her miserable.
I hate that.
I hate that that it happened to you.
I wanna go back in time, and I wanna find that little girl, make her feel better.
you know what? You do. Every day.
I'm stealing these.
all right, so, uh, what are you gonna do about sarah?
well, she was shy. I remember that. So that can get a bit tricky.
and ghosts have no idea how much time is going by, so I'm gonna have to go looking for her.
cool. Your first ghost hunt.
Yeah. And if she's like most ghosts, she'll be haunting places that are familiar to her.
which means?
which means I have to go home.
it isn't fair.
just get in the house right now.
Mrs. Riley?
uh, I hope that you remember me.
Melinda Gordon.
Oh! Of course.
Melinda!
look at you. You're all grown up.
you look just radiant. Life must be agreeing with you.
so far. You look great, too.
Oh, aren't you kind. What brings you back?
well, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about a little girl in my class.
I know it's been a long time.
but do you remember Sarah Applewhite?
Yeah, I do.
it was terribly sad.
do you remember my reaction that day?
I do.
little children have big imaginations.
so don't you be embarrassed.
it undoubtedly was your way of processing your grief.
right.
I was wondering do you know what happened to Sarah's parents.
because I tried to look them up in the hamilton phone book, but they were unlisted.
they broke up shortly after Sarah passed away.
you know, I understand that it often happens when a couple loses a child.
do you know where either one of them went?
no, sweetheart, I don't.
and if I did once, it's gone now.
time is a funny thing, isn't it?
Yeah.
it sure is.
I'm running out of time.
Sarah?
Chloe, come on. You're gonna miss the bus.
OK, I'm coming.
I looked everywhere.
all the places we used to hang out as kids. She was nowhere.
just that one glimpse, and that was it.
can these be engraved? What?
these soaps... can I have them monogrammed?
why would you wanna do that?
Yes. Actually, I know a place on-line that'll do that.
I will write down the web site for you.
I think something triggered her reappearance...
something that she's not aware of.
and all I have to do... Hey, we've got lotions.
back there.
I'm not interested.
OK. This is their web site.
and they will monogram anything. Just e-mail them.
thank you. -Thank you.
Melinda, that was a customer.
Oh, what did I say? You know what I can't figure out?
is why she's being so elusive, 'cause she was shy when she was a kid.
but it's like a constant game of hide-and-seek with her.
well, maybe she's self-conscious.
Andrea, ghosts are not self-conscious.
Melinda.
Melinda, you can see me, can't you?
I know you can.
why aren't you talking to me?
go away. You'll get me in trouble.
well, talk to me first.
Melinda.
why are you wearing your nightgown in school?
Oh, my god. You're right.
you're right. She is self-conscious.
that's why she disappeared when I pointed out that she was in her nightgown.
you're a genius.
thank you. Now can we move these dolls 'cause they are freaking me out.
Oh, bedtime already. The things I have to do.
you stay and study. I have to meet someone in the bedroom.
say again?
my little friend.
Oh. What makes you think she's gonna come?
I'm playing a hunch. See ya.
Sarah.
it's me.
Melinda.
nobody's here but me.
can we talk for a second?
here I am getting ready for bed in my nightgown.
just like you.
shoot.
Hey, why don't you come visit me and it'll be like a... like a sleepover.
you know ghosts don't sleep.
so you know you're a ghost.
well, I don't feel sick anymore, and I'm wandering around for like 2 days.
OK. So when you look at me, do I look older to you?
Why?
is it your birthday?
it will be on friday.
you'll be 9. like me.
9, right.
why were you so mean to me yesterday, Melinda?
you didn't talk to me at all.
I am... I am so sorry.
it was just... you know.
it was math.
I didn't wanna make Mrs. Riley mad.
Yeah. She's pretty strict.
so what did you wanna talk to me about?
are you trying to find the light?
Oh, no. I see the light. It's over there.
well, then why don't you go into it?
you'd probably feel more at home over there.
I can't. I'm worried.
about what?
my mom and dad.
I could hear them getting into a big fight the other night outside my door in the hospital.
and it was really scary.
they sounded like they hated each other.
I bet they were just worried about you.
I went back home. Some other family lives there now.
they got scared when I tried to make them talk to me.
I bet.
so I don't wanna do that light thing till I know where my mom and dad are.
and I'm running out of time.
what are their names?
Jack and Grace.
daddy build the buildings, and mommy...
damn it. Sarah.
Hey. I don't think we're gonna be able to do Melinda's party.
I was gonna say exactly the same thing.
I don't get it. She's not vain in any way.
why do she dislike her birthday so much?
something to do with her mother.
they had a falling-out before we ever got together.
I've only met the woman myself a couple of times.
if the past is any indication, until this birthday thing is over, we're going to have a very gloomy Melinda. Brace yourself.
Jack Applewhite is an architect.
I thought he was a contractor.
then I looked up "architects." There he was.
Sarah is gonna be so excited that I found him.
I have an appointment to meet with him at 2: 00.
can we have lunch tomorrow instead?
Yeah. Uh, sure.
OK. Bye.
Bye.
or she's gonna be really happy.
excuse me.
my appointment with Mr. Applewhite was at 2: 00, and it's now 2: 45.
I'm sorry. He's running a little bit late.
OK. I just have to get back to work.
Marie, change of plans. I have a 3: 00 with the board.
Mr. Applewhite, hi. I'm Melinda Gordon. I had a 2: 00 appointment.
I'm very sorry. You'll have to reschedule. I have a meeting across town.
actually, I've come on a personal matter.
tell Marie I said to give you whatever time you want.
I went to school with your daughter Sarah.
you knew Sarah?
Yeah. We were in the 4th grade together.
Sarah would be just your age.
what's this about?
well, I, uh...had a dream the other night about Sarah, and then I kept thinking I was seeing her everywhere.
it happens to me, too. Has for years.
and then last night, I saw Sarah.
what?
she's coming to me.
not just in dreams. I can see her spirit.
I see.
that's very interesting. Good luck with that.
Mr. Applewhite, I'm serious.
Well,I'm very late.
and, um, like I said before, why don't you just call my assistant...
don't tell me...
what the hell.
Melinda, make him believe.
what have you done to this elevator?
nothing. Nothing. I swear. Sarah's here.
don't say "Sarah." Say "cookie.
cookie.
because I liked oreo cookies.
she loves oreos, and you called her "cookie monster,"
and you shortened it.
he remembers.
who are you? How are you doing this? How are you doing this?
I swear, Mr. Applewhite, I just wanna help Sarah.
it's easy to say someone was the love of your life.
didn't even come close to Grace and me.
she knew everything about me. Good, bad, indifferent.
we were poor together, successful together.
we let each other down, propped each other up.
I could never figure out how I got so lucky.
then we had Sarah. It was like a fairy tale.
then Sarah got sick.
we saw it every time we looked at her.
we saw it every time we looked at each other.
and pretty soon, we just stopped...looking at each other.
Sarah said that you were, um...arguing outside her hospital roo the night before she died.
she heard us?
I didn't even know she was conscious.
what were you arguing about?
this new treatment. It was experimental.
I wanted Sarah to try it. Grace was against it.
she felt Sarah's little body had been through enough.
of course she was right.
the treatment had side effects we didn't even know about then.
if I had known she could hear us...
she's been trying to find you.
I know you're divorce, but I didn't know what to say to her.
I never got over what happened.
I never got over Grace.
Then...last year, I ran into her again.
grace?
it was like no time had passed.
went for a walk, had coffee then dinner, went for another walk.
it was like a miracle.
we found each other again, and it felt...new.
we made plans to have dinner that friday at a restaurant we both love.
but Grace never showed.
I called her, but all I got was her machine.
she called the next day, and I knew, uh, she'd been crying.
she said 3 words to me.
too much pain.
she took a job in another city.
wouldn't tell me where.
that was the last I heard of her.
Sarah was hoping to talk to the two of you together.
is she here now?
no.
she's afraid that...she was responsible for your anger at Grace.
I,I should tell her.
I'd like to find Grace first, if you don't mind.
what if you don't find her?
well... then I'll come back.
Melinda, what did he say?
you don't have to hide, Sarah. No one can see you.
you can.
Yeah, well, there aren't a whole lot of people like me.
maybe none, for all I know.
look, Sarah, your father loved your mother very much.
but you were right. They don't live together anymore.
because I got sick.
no, it's not your fault. They love you.
then where's my mom?
moved away. We don't know where.
maybe your mom knows.
what?
our moms were friends once.
they knew each other in high school.
why don't you ask her?
I can't go see her.
it's like she's jealous that the gift skipped a generation or something.
she called again.
you have to tell me that?
I think she just wanted suggestions for a birthday present.
Oh, well, that's touching, considering that she ruined birthdays for me forever.
Mel...
don't give her that kind of power.
it's your birthday. Take it back.
I would if I could.
believe me.
Yay! Well done.
Mmm! I love you. My big girl.
I love you, too, mommy.
why don't you girls go inside and get her presents while I'm cutting the cake.
did you make a wish, honey?
was it what we talked about?
what did you talk about?
Oh, we had a little chat about the importance of birthdays and how it gives us the perfect chance to be grateful for the most important gift that we have together.
mother, what are you doing? It's her birthday.
it's not a day for celebrating death.
we're celebrating life.
by taking her on macabre field trips to funeral parlors?
don't think I didn't hear about that.
Melinda needs to be educated.
I am trying to protect her from that.
mommy, grandma.
Melinda, why don't you go inside and join the girls.
no, Beth. She should stay right here.
Melinda's gift is nothing to be ashamed of.
and you can't avoid the reality of it forever.
OK, mother, fine. I give up.
from now on, you just celebrate her birthday any damn way you want and leave me out of it.
Melinda, I'm gonna go lie down.
I'm getting another migraine, thanks to your grandmother.
Hi, mom.
Melinda.
is everything ok? Are you all right?
Yeah. Everything's fine.
I just wasn't expecting you.
it was kind of last minute.
you look beautiful.
well, come in.
sorry about the mess.
I've been so busy lately, the house has gotten kind of out of control.
not that it was ever in control.
anyway, you know what I mean.
how's Jim?
he's fine.
I've been meaning to come out and see what you've done with the house.
it all sounds so wonderful.
somehow I just haven't had the time.
Hey, well, come sit down. You want something to drink?
no. Thanks. I can only stay for a minute.
Oh.
I was hope...
well...
that's just fine.
it's so good to see you.
you cut your hair.
it's very becoming.
it really is.
why is she so nervous?
I came here because I needed to get some information, and I thought you'd be able to help me.
me?
do you remember Sarah Applewhite?
she was in my 4th-grade class.
of course, darling. I went to high school with her mother.
we used to get together when you kids were babies.
of course then poor Sarah got sick, and Grace and Jack kind of closed ranks on the outside world.
but then you know the rest.
actually, I'm just now remembering the rest.
first time I ever saw a spirit, remember?
Melinda, do we have to?
do we have to what?
why does everything always come back to spirits?
why do you hate talking about it so much?
because it upsets me.
all I ever wanted for you was a normal life.
why, mom? Why is normal so good?
my life is fascinating.
it's extraordinary.
I found a way to really help people.
why can't you just be happy about that?
she can't, Melinda.
ghosts scare her.
I really don't wanna get into this conversation.
you came for information.
just tell me what you want.
I was right. Your mom knows where my mom is.
let's go.
maybe I should go and talk to your mom alone first.
Why?
well, 'cause there might be grown-up talk.
Melinda, you're a kid.
she's not gonna talk to you about grown-up stuff.
right. Um, well, you wanna talk to your mom and dad together, right?
well, ok.
but how will I know it's time?
wait for me at my house.
you're all grown up. I can't believe it.
it was so good to talk to your mother. How is she?
good. Fine.
we had a lot of laughs, she and I.
I used to bring Sarah over, and you would have a ball.
you'd play for hours.
I'm sorry. I don't remember.
why would you? You were only 2 or 3.
but for us grown-ups, those memories, they never fade.
your mother...
I've never seen a woman more in love with her child.
unless, of course, it was me.
we would sit there staring at the two of you in amazement.
so perfect, so beautiful.
the picture of health.
grace, are... are you all right?
forgive me, but you don't... you don't look well.
um... don't I?
uh, well, I...
I suppose there's a reason for that.
you're sick?
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.
it's a genetic illness.
which means, of course, I'm the reason that Sarah got it in the first place.
but I don't understand.
there's treatment. People are cured now.
I wouldn't let Sarah have the treatment then, and she died.
how could I survive the thing that killed my little girl?
Yeah, but you have your whole life ahead of you.
you know, for some people, Melinda, that's not particularly good news.
did my mother ever tell you about my grandmother?
she had this gift
Beth never told me.
do you believe it?
my grandma helped a lot of people.
my mom never understood.
it seems that it skips a generation.
which means you can do it, too?
Sarah came to me 2 days ago.
Melinda.
don't say it if it isn't true.
it is true.
and now I think I know why.
your sickness... the fact that it's gotten more serious...
it's triggered Sarah to come and find you.
she needs to talk to you and her father together.
are you willing to do that?
Melinda, I'll meet with Jack.
but you have to promise me that you won't tell him I'm sick, or I can't do this.
promise.
Hi.
come on in.
Hi. I got your message, but I don't...
grace?
I, I don't...
are you back?
I never left, Jack.
I'm sorry.
I, I, I don't understand.
you lied to me?
please, don't be angry.
mommy, daddy.
um, Sarah's here.
are they still mad?
she wants to know if you're still mad at each other.
no, honey.
I... at least I'm not.
of course we're not.
would you tell her we're so sorry that she overheard us arguing that night.
we never meant to hurt her.
she can hear you.
ask them if they still love each other.
she wants to know if you're still in love with each other.
I always have.
mommy?
grace, she's asking you.
Oh, yes. I love your dad, honey.
don't ever worry about that.
does daddy know that she's sick?
how did you know?
know what?
I can feel it.
she's sick like I was.
you have to tell daddy.
I can't.
what did she say?
I can't tell you.
what? This is ridiculous.
you call us together to talk to our daughter, then you can't tell us what she's saying?
grace, she knows. And she wants Jack to know.
about what?
I knew this was a mistake.
I'm sorry. I can't.
no, Jack.
grace.
how long have you known?
since last year?
why... why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want you to...
watch someone you love...
I wanted you to be happy.
happy?
don't you know the only time I've ever been happy was with you?
I don't wanna fight it.
I don't wanna survive if she couldn't.
it's not right.
I want you to come with me, mommy.
I miss you so much.
she misses you so much.
I don't want you to die yet.
I want you to stay here with daddy.
she wants you to... get well, Grace.
she wants you to be with Jack.
tell them it's ok to be happy.
tell them that I'm happy.
everything is the way that it's supposed to be.
she wants you to know that she's happy.
and that everything is the way it's supposed to be.
Oh!
they're not mad anymore.
no.
thanks to you, they're not.
I feel like I wanna go there now.
to that light.
well, I think you're ready.
she's going into the light.
Sarah?
you'll always be with us.
we'll never forget you, cookie.
Bye-bye, baby.
I love you.
it's not scary at all, Melinda.
you can tell your mother that.
why can't you see value in what I do?
what?
two people who love each other very much are together again, and that should be worth something.
but for some reason, you just judge me. Why?
let me make this very clear. I have never judged you.
but you have to understand.
I went through the early years of this thing with you.
I remember your nightmares.
I remember how scared you were, how lonely you were, coming home from school crying.
how do you think that makes a mother feel?
how do you think it made me feel?
horrible. That's my point.
you know, I haven't always... wanted this gift for myself.
in fact, sometimes I absolutely hate it.
but I do good with it, mom.
I help.
grandma helped.
I understand that, Melinda.
you don't know how...
I am happy for you. I am.
no.
what is it that you're not telling me?
why is it that I always feel like there's something you wanna say and you never do?
well, I'm not scared of ghosts, if that's what you mean.
I don't even know why you said that to me.
I didn't say it.
Yes, you did. Yesterday.
no, mom, I didn't say that.
Sarah said it.
you saw her. You saw Sarah.
no.
Yes, you did.
stop it, Melinda. I didn't see her.
I heard her.
can you see them?
no. I don't know.
sometimes maybe.
I hate it. It makes me feel like I'm crazy.
makes you feel crazy?
think about how I've been feeling this whole time.
no wonder you've had headaches all these years, 'cause you've been trying to just push it away.
I can help you.
I don't want you to help me. Ok?
I'm glad that you have made your peace with this.
I really am.
but please, don't ask me to feel the same.
now, it's getting late.
I've got things to do.
happy birthday.
that is unbelievable about your mother.
in all these years you never knew.
strange, huh?
do you think your grandmother knew?
I was just thinking about that. I wonder.
do it.
all right, look, can I just say it?
Oh! Yes.
all right.
happy birthday.
thank you.
you know, I was thinking that it would be fun to go out tonight and...celebrate.
you were?
Yeah. Life is good. You know?
and racking up another year, well, that is...
that's big stuff.
damn straight.
big stuff.
I'm gonna go round up the usual suspects.
sounds good.
except from the time that I was a little girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.
to tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.
everything is for sale except the buddha and those two paintings.
we don't really have room for all of this in the store, so we thought that maybe we would take some pictures and sell the larger items online.
that sounds fine. [Cell phone rings]
excuse me. Hello? Oh, hey, roger.
can you hold on one second?
can I show you the upstairs?
Hello? No, I can't. 3: 00 is the latest.
well, then it'll have to be when I get back.
all right, roger. Let me know. Thanks.
you know, I hate to even suggest this,
well, I don't have the time for all that.
and actually, I'd rather do it locally.
you know, support main street.
well, we're thrilled.
it's just a little more inventory than we're used to.
you'll do fine.
you know, this is an amazing house.
do you mind me asking why you're leaving?
I just felt like I needed a fresh start, and I wanted to be closer to my main office.
did you wanna see the baby?
is it ok? Oh, sure.
she's so cute.
a joy. She's been a very easy baby.
[Cell phone rings] Oh! Excuse me.
Hey. What's happening?
no. What's up?
no, I'm still in Grandview.
Oh! I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm Andrea Moreno.
I'm cataloguing Christine's antiques so we can sell them.
do I look like an antique to you?
no.
well, you picked the wrong door.
right. Well... I'll just be going now.
don't tell Christine you saw the nanny smoking.
promise I won't.
Melinda.
what are you doing?
the door was open.
nothing in this room is for sale.
why don't we head over to my office?
I have great fifties furniture.
cool. I love that stuff.
we are in completely over our heads right now.
I know. But I am loving it.
can you imagine if we sell all this stuff, plus the stuff we have online?
Yeah. Sotheby's will be recommending us.
God. Christine is unbelievable.
I love her taste.
do you find her a little intimidating?
no, I find her to be surprisingly nice.
hmm. Maybe it's because I've worn her clothes and read all these magazine articles about her, but I find her a little larger than life.
you've read about her?
do you know if she lost a son?
I don't remember reading anything about that.
cause there was a boy's room on the second floor, just no boy.
well, she's separated.
maybe he's with the husband.
no, there was a presence there.
no spit, but his toys came alive.
[Chuckles] I'm assuming not in a cute Pixar, toy story kind of way.
Ah, no. It was menacing.
Wow. What do you think he wants?
I don't know. I'll have to go back and see him later.
well, my advice: Stay away from the nanny, 'cause that chick's a little off.
this is so sad.
I'm just trying to catch a glimpse of my husband.
you didn't see him this morning?
he left before I woke up.
WY don't you go on over and say hi?
cause I don't want to bug him while he's at work.
OK, you just completely lost my sympathy.
[To a customer] Hi. Can I help you?
Hi. Is Christine here?
uh, no. She's out of town. She'll be back tomorrow night.
she was supposed to have left some boxes for me.
Oh, yeah, yeah! Come on in.
I left the baby in the kitchen.
Hi, sweetheart!
are you having your lunch?
Oh! Sweet potatoes. My favorite.
she seems so good-natured.
most of the time, yes.
but she can howl like a banshee when she wants something.
how long have you worked for Christine?
Oh, just a few months.
the last nanny quit with no notice.
do you know why Christine is leaving town?
she told me that she missed the city.
you were right. She can be closer to her office.
well, there are a lot of bad memories for her in this house.
painful memories.
uh, memories about her son?
she told you about Daniel?
well, I... saw the room.
she wouldn't let me go in, so I assumed...
I mean, losing a child?
I don't know.
I don't know how anybody ever gets over it.
I don't think you do get over it.
I think you just do what Christine's doing and try to move on.
Yeah. Well, her husband had no trouble moving on.
he took a job in japan right after their second child was born.
it was divorce by fedEx, I think.
what happened to the boy?
[Low, menacing voice] Shut up!
are you ok?
there are lot of strange things that happen in this house.
Yeah. I'm getting that impression.
[Whispering] Where are you?
[Door closes] Hello?
let the romance begin.
hmm? Oh.
Hey, gorgeous. Come here.
I was just about to start cooking.
Yeah, you seem really motivated.
I'll rally.
you know what? This is ridiculous.
well, the truth is I volunteered.
Why?
I'm just trying to sock away some real money.
for what?
the future.
all right. I'm fully awake. I'm completely alert.
Hey! Do you want me to make dinner?
I lied. I must be dreaming.
you know what? I'm starting to like cooking.
if you weren't always hogging the kitchen, maybe I would get some practice.
what do you want to drink?
Jim: Beer.
remember that customer I told you about?
the fashion designer?
her kid died and I saw him today.
Jim! Huh! Oh. What?
I was just... I was, um...
I'm awake.
I'm really very awake.
let the machine get it.
Hello?
boy: Who's watching the baby?
Hey. Hey. You all right?
dinner? No? I'm sorry.
can I help? I don't know. I love you.
I love you, too.
[Busy signal] Dammit!
Yeah.
the baby's fine. It's the mother.
God. She treats me like I'm her wife.
Yeah. She's got me doing the grocery shopping, picking up her dry cleaning.
no. Listen, the baby's fine.
the place is beautiful.
[Low voice] Watch me!
hang on. The baby's crying.
listen, I'm gonna have to call you back.
Shh. It's ok. It's all right.
there you are. Hey. It's all right.
that was weird, huh?
that was weird, but everything's fine now.
all right.
what's bothering you, kiddo?
it's all right.
who's there?
who is it?!
who's there?!
what do you want? [Evil laugh]
leave me alone!
leave me alone! Leave me alone!
Georgina!
Georgina?
Yes, this is an emergency.
there's been an accident.
Georgina!
I don't want to leave her at the hospital alone.
she's a little banged up, but she's stable now.
not exactly the romantic evening we had in mind.
I'm sorry.
don't be. I'm glad you called me over here.
the baby's ok?
Yeah. She stopped crying.
I gave her a crossword puzzle.
it seemed to do something.
just one more woman that finds you irresistible.
so, do you have any contact information on Christine?
Yeah. Her number was in the kitchen.
I left a message on her cell phone and her assistant's.
thank you.
you know what, Jim? I gotta go.
are you sure that nothing weird has happened?
no angry spirit or anything?
Hey, hey. Stop worrying, ok? Everything's fine.
what's wrong?
nothing.
she woke up. I just got smiled.
you're a saint. I'll call you back.
talk to you then.
Hey. Look what you did.
[Whispering] Georgina?
Georgina?
there's something in that house.
what?
it was the boy. He did this to me.
Georgina, you need to rest.
he's a demon child.
watch the baby. She's in danger.
I will. Ok?
Melinda? Melinda: Yes.
Oh, thank god!
what happened? How's the baby?
Oh, don't worry. The baby is... is fine.
Georgina had an accident.
she fell down the stairs.
Where's Jessie?
she's with my husband.
your husband?
he's a paramedic. She's safe with him.
Melinda, I don't understand. How did you get involved?
um...
well, l... I went back to your house earlier...
to... to get my purse, um...
because I'd left it behind, and, uh...
I saw that Georgina had fallen.
is she ok?
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.
it was just a freak accident.
[Sighs] this is such a nightmare.
OK, I'm getting the next flight back.
I'm on my way back to your house now, and I will stay there until you get home.
Melinda, are you comfortable watching a baby?
Hey, I bought a car off the baby-sitting money I made in high school.
I guess that means yes.
we'll take good care of her, ok?
just get home as soon as you can.
OK. Thank you so much, Melinda.
thank you for everything.
looking for something?
I know you're here. Where is she?
what did you do with the baby?
you shouldn't have fallen asleep.
Jim? Hello? Where are you?
Hey.
honey, I've been worried.
is everything ok?
Yeah. Yeah, everything's good.
I think spirit boy's messing with my head, but otherwise, things are fine.
you're amazing to do this.
it's like practice.
[To Jessie] Have you been sleeping?
Yeah, she was up just a few minutes ago.
you're wasting your time, Daniel.
he was here. Now he's gone... for now.
you think he's dangerous?
if you can't see him, he might be.
as long as I can keep an eye on him and not let jessie out of my sight, we should be ok.
Christina will be on the first flight back in the morning.
so, uh, what do we do?
we take turns watching the baby, right?
I'll watch the baby, see if I can talk to Daniel.
you get some sleep. You look exhausted.
all right. Good night.
don't cry.
you can trust me, you know.
I won't hurt you.
that's a beautiful sight.
why aren't you sleeping?
I gotta go to work soon.
here. Let me try.
[Whispering] How you doing, girl?
I'm impressed.
OK. There you are.
snug as a bug in a rug.
something my mom taught me.
makes you think, doesn't it?
sure. How can it not?
you'd make a great mom, you know that?
whoa. We're not ready. It's just not time yet.
I know. I know we said we'd wait.
I do. I just...
sometimes I wonder what we're waiting for.
a finished house, for one thing.
we have so much to do. Work, save money.
I'm taking every shift I can.
you're really planning on this.
I'm just thinking ahead.
well, it's... just not the right time.
when?
you can't put a clock on it.
your heart tells you when you're ready, not your bank account.
I'm just not there yet.
I better go to work.
I'll call you.
please don't hurt her.
no, you don't hurt her.
I just wanna help you. Why are you still here?
I live here.
this is my home.
but you don't live here anymore.
I mean, don't you get it?
you're mother's leaving because of you.
you've driven her out.
she was hardly ever here anyway.
the job always came first.
treated me like I was invisible.
Melinda: Lots of moms work hard.
[Low, evil voice] You just don't get it!
[Baby cries] Stop it!
you're scaring your sister.
just leave me alone!
Daniel?
I know that it's hard to walk away from your mother and sister, but there's a better place for you.
I'm not going.
you're just hurting yourself and everyone around you.
is that what you really want?
I'm not leaving until they find her.
who?
Suzanne.
who is she?
my nanny before.
is she special to you?
special.
Melinda!
Melinda! I'm up here.
Oh, my god. I was so worried.
that's ok. She's fine.
she slept almost all the way through the night.
how's Georgina?
OK. Nothing's broken. It's a miracle.
just some bruises.
I guess that'll be a lawsuit.
I'm sorry.
you must think I'm hard or something.
no. I know that you have a lot of stress.
it's just that work is really important to me.
I want her to have everything that she needs, especially now that her father's gone.
it's what I wanted for my son, too.
Georgina told me that you lost your son.
I'm so sorry.
my husband and I, we were so... devastated.
we couldn't figure out a plan.
we didn't know what to do.
I thought if we had another child it would give us a second chance.
and it didn't.
Ted just couldn't get back on track.
I'm so sorry.
no. No, I'm just really glad that it all worked out.
there must be something I can do.
maybe one thing.
you had a nanny before. Suzanne.
do you know how I might reach her?
who told you about Suzanne?
Georgina... mentioned her.
cause I have a friend who's looking for a nanny.
well, tell your friend to keep looking.
she doesn't want Suzanne.
you think Suzanne might be responsible for Daniel's death?
I don't know, but either way, I have to find out.
because Daniel may be looking for revenge.
man, he sounds like a little terror.
Yeah, he's very troubled.
I wish you'd called me last night.
I would have been glad to come and help.
Jim was there. Otherwise, I definitely would have.
Ah! I get it.
you were living out your dirty babysitter fantasy.
hardly. He saw me with the baby and started talking about having one of our own.
Oh! That's exciting.
no, not really.
Oh, come on, Melinda.
every time you see a baby, you're practically drooling.
that does not mean I want to start a family tomorrow.
fine. Procreate at your own pace.
see if I care.
you know what? I totally get it.
it's a huge responsibility.
you shouldn't rush into it.
he'll understand.
Oh! I found something! What is it?
a newspaper report on Daniel's death.
does it say how he died?
no. The police say it was accidental.
but it does give me Suzanne's last name.
Mr. Richards?
yeah?
is Suzanne here?
who's asking?
sorry. I'm Melinda Gordon.
I'm a friend of Christine Greene.
Oh, no. Please don't bring this whole thing up again.
I may be able to help her.
how?
can you just tell me where I could find her?
you've seen me.
you gotta help me.
come on, lady. The jig is up.
you looked me right in the eye.
she's been living here for years.
do you have any idea how long I've been hanging around this place?
it's depressing.
the sheer monotony, not to mention the smell.
bleach and ammonia.
I can't take it anymore.
Oh, right. The kid gets your attention.
what am I, wood?
you know what? I need you to help me find Suzanne Richards.
now you need my help?
she's a caretaker, in her twenties.
are you gonna help me talk to my wife or not?
if you help me find Suzanne, I will owe you one, ok? I promise.
I can't believe this.
please?
she works up on the second floor.
she was just up there changing the beds.
Hi. Who are you?
Melinda Gordon.
are you ok?
Yeah, I think so.
I just don't know what happened.
I'm... I'm sorry. Who are you?
you're Suzanne, right?
I'm a friend of the Greene family.
Oh.
and I want to talk to you about Daniel.
I'm sorry. I don't know what you want, but I don't talk about Daniel.
well, he talks about you.
Daniel's dead. Daniel's here.
who the hell are you?
just a person who's trying to help you.
look, I know that this is hard to believe, but Daniel's here...
his spirit anyway...
and he told me that he won't cross over until he sees you.
I'm calling security.
please don't.
just give me 5 minutes.
you may be in danger.
she's wearing the bracelet I made her.
this is the one she made me.
he says that you're wearing the bracelet he made you, and he's wearing the one that you made him.
I don't understand.
ask her if she remembers what happened that day.
do I remember? What kind of question is that?
I'll always remember.
he wants you to tell me.
I only know what happened after.
after what?
after he went upstairs to see Christine.
it was Saturday, my day off, but Christine had asked me to do some household chores for her.
I heard Daniel. He was upset.
he was running down the stairs.
Daniel?
Daniel!
Daniel! Stop! What are you doing?!
Daniel!
by the time I got there, it was too late.
I saw him die.
he died right in front of me, looking at me.
he said his last words to me.
and then Christine was right there behind me.
Christine: Why didn't you stop him?! Why didn't you stop him?!
I didn't know! I didn't know!
Daniel! Daniel! Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Somebody help!
somebody help! Somebody! Please!
somebody help us!
Daniel! Daniel! Somebody help!
it was all over in less than a minute.
sometimes I wake up thinking I should have stopped him somehow.
there must have been a way.
maybe if I would have been quicker.
but she's wrong.
she couldn't have done anything.
I never meant for her to get blamed.
she's the only person that took care of me, the only person that really cared.
she made me laugh.
sit with me for hours and play with the trains.
what? What's happening?
one second.
[Sighs] they all had crazy relationships in that town, Bakersville.
he's talking about Bakersville.
he's really here.
tell her she couldn't have stopped me.
it wasn't her job.
not that day.
there's nothing you could do.
Daniel, I miss you so much.
tell her I miss her, too.
he misses you, too.
he's crying.
I'm not crying!
why is she here with all these old people?
he wants to know why you're not working with kids anymore.
I haven't really been able to be around kids.
it's better this way.
what does he want?
I want her to go talk to my mom.
he wants you to go and talk to Christine.
no.
I can't. I...
no. I couldn't face her.
I need her to tell my mother what I said right before I died.
I didn't know if... if you'd see me.
Melinda said there was a good reason.
there is.
I just need you to have an open mind and listen.
Suzanne has something that she needs to tell you.
Christine...
the day Daniel died, when I heard the crash, I ran to the car.
I got there. Daniel was conscious.
he looked up at me, and he told me something that I was never gonna tell you.
he said...
I wish you were my mother.
he said that to you?
that's a terrible thing to tell me even if it's true.
I know. I'm sorry.
this is something that I was never gonna tell you.
well, then why now?
because Daniel wanted you to hear it.
what are you talking about?
Christine, the weird things that happen in this house, the sounds, the accident with Georgina, it's all Daniel.
he's still here.
are you completely out of your mind?
it's true.
I didn't believe it either, but it's true.
moving out of this house is not gonna solve anything.
Daniel will follow you.
so you're telling me that my son...
is haunting me?
yes...
and he's here right now.
Oh, my god. This is too much.
this is too much.
ask her if she remembers the promise.
he wants to know if you remember the promise you made.
well, if he's really here, ask him to tell you.
well, it was the day after she got back from a 2-week business trip.
Danny, I have to work.
all the time?
it's not all the time.
I know it seems that way.
Yes, it is all the time.
even when you're home, you're on the phone, the computer, doing something.
we live a good life.
what do you think pays for that?
that doesn't come for free, sweetie. You know that.
yes...
but what good is this good life?
what good is it? I never see you.
OK. How about on Saturday, we got to the baseball game? Just you and me.
how does that sound?
I guess.
OK. It's a date, all right? Ok.
daniel: She broke that promise like all others.
Yes, it is the same clothing.
I'm looking at it right now.
no, you cannot sell the same clothing line on the web site that they're selling at Bloomingdale's.
that's a breach of my contract with them.
honey, this is a really important phone call.
mom, we're missing the first inning.
5 minutes. Give me 5 minutes.
what? No. You're gonna have to take if off the web site.
that's the only solution.
I'll go. I'm sorry...
mom.
I'm going!
I'm going by myself!
he's telling you this? Right now?
Why?
because he wants you to know why he was so angry, why he is so angry.
Daniel, I did it all for you.
I grew up with nothing.
I wasn't gonna let that happen to you.
I grew up with nothing, too.
I just had a lot of stuff.
I just wanted her.
he said that everything you gave him never mattered.
he just wanted to spend time with you.
that's all he needed.
he loved you, Christine.
he was always talking about you.
he was always thinking about what would make you happy, what would make you proud of him.
I was proud of him.
I just wished she would have shown it to me sometimes.
he just wishes that you would have shown him how you felt.
I thought he knew.
tell her she has to be different with Jessie.
she can't have it happen again.
he wants you to be different with Jessie.
she really needs you.
OK.
tell her that that's why I scared the other nannies away.
that's why he gave the other nannies such a hard time.
tell him I'm sorry.
he knows.
tell her I'm gonna be ok now...
that I want her to be happy.
am I supposed to be over there?
the light? Yeah.
tell Suzanne she shouldn't be afraid to work with kids again.
tell Suzanne she shouldn't be afraid to work with kids again.
I love you.
Thanks.
good-bye.
I'll go... no.
I got it.
Hi! I'm home! Where are you?
Hi. Are you home for the night?
Bobby is back at work tomorrow.
so I do not have to be in until noon.
Hallelujah. I get my husband back.
no, no! No!
I'm cooking for you tonight, and you are not helping me in any way.
I'm backing away from grocery bags.
this is supposed to be a surprise, so shoo!
I said shoo.
all right. Just getting a beer.
stop it.
you know, we never finished our conversation.
what conversation?
the baby conversation.
Oh. I thought we finished that conversation, at least for now.
what's wrong, Mel?
nothing's wrong.
we always talk about having babies.
it always makes you laugh.
I know you wanna wait. That's ok. But...
there's something else.
seems like you're scared by it.
maybe I am.
Why?
well, because I always thought the gift skipped a generation.
now I'm not so sure.
you're afraid our baby might be able to......
no...
yes... I don't know. It's just, um...
it's hard to be different.
it's a struggle, especially when you're a kid.
the ridicule, humiliation, loneliness.
are you lonely?
I mean, she can hardly speak to me.
sometimes barely even look at me.
what if I'm like that with our kids?
that's never gonna happen.
I know you.
and our kids, they'll know who they are, and they'll know it's ok.
whatever they do or can't do, they'll be loved.
how will you feel?
me? I'll be happy to have a whole brood of baby ghostbusters.
now I know you're a liar.
no. If they all turn out like you, I don't see the downside.
bring it on.
my name is melinda gordon.
I'm married, I live in a small town, and I own an antique shop.
I might be just like you.
except that from the time I was a little girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.
it's all right, honey. Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.
they're stuck here, because they have unfinished business with the living, and they come to me for help.
in order to tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.
help me, can you get me out of here?
can anybody hear me?
I can hear you and I know your secret what secret?
you're seriously in touch with your
I glad to say easily mused
I love that about you you konw, large shoes where did nen go?
hei hudini, how about making...parents?
sorry I would have to stay
I also said that you would have to explain why
I have really important
I was a well this do, I'll stay
I hope you not accept as long as you keep it thanks mon, thanks melinda if he even crack...on this projet, I can so, what do you mean to do?
close up, we're going shopping face to the last 20 years, I never thought I have to leave it that such slow
xxxxxxx you could saw your staff on mine too or get somebody else to do it, and saw yourself on too much people melinda, you got to look at this see what i mean?
Oh, i didn't know i that put these out are these not for sale?
no no.they're for sale, everything must go i can understand...
wo.are they could be whatever you like if you don't get these, i'll get them myself ok, i'll take them. you have a good idea you go shopping with me and telling me what oh, you're going be sorry you said that
so where do you want me to put these?
Oh, we don't have to do that now.
are you kidding?
I haven't been this jazzed since I sold my first house.
seems like a thousand years ago.
and please don't tell ned.
I want him to think that covering his hours was a huge sacrifice for me.
uh...
you know what I think ? this shelf isn't level.
you wanna put a piece of wood right underneath this leg.
you know, maybe we could just keep the ornaments in the box for now.
P. O.P Point of purchase.
you always wanna put some out front where everyone can see them.
I'll think about that.
that's the point.
you don't wanna think. You just wanna buy.
can you just put them back, please?
s-sure.
I didn't mean to-- it's just sometimes when I have new things,
I like to hold off on putting them out until I'm really sure where they're going. I understand.
I understand.
Melinda, I am so sorry.
I just get carried away sometimes.
me, too.
I guess I'm just a little on edge I know it's not easy being your own boss.
I used to think that I was gonna open up my own place, have a little store like this one.
I was either gonna call it delia's decorations or the curbside curator.
and why didn't you?
I got married, I had ned, and then the concept of someday just becomes a little more abstract.
uh, how did you get into real estate?
when my husband died.
I had to think of a plan "b" in a hurry.
there's no time to grow a small business.
I had to get out there and make some money, so...
got my real estate license.
could you grab some newspapers and maybe check for estate sales?
sure. No problem.
as soon as you can, before they run out.
on my way.
want anything else?
no. Thanks.
OK.
who are you?
what's going on?
what's happening?
talk to me. I can help.
stop it.
don't do that.
just please stop it.
please.
stop it! Aah!
stop!
please.
can you see me?
so you can see and hear this ghost, but he can't see or hear you?
Yeah, How's that for a cruel twist of fate?
maybe this ghost is deaf and blind.
it's like he's trapped here, being tormented by these christmas ornaments.
not everybody likes the holidays.
he's definitely trying to get rid of them.
it's like they're alive, breathing.
I've never seen anything like it.
where are they now?
well, I was hoping the answer was hidden, you know, deeply away somewhere in the store.
well, they're pretty.
I wish you could see this.
let me hold you.
can't I touch you?
No!
don't do that.
no.
stop it!
leave me alone!
no. Stop it! Leave me ...
come on.
keep breathing.
stand up. You're all right.
what happened?
you tell me.
you just blacked out there for a while.
I--I felt scared and really angry.
it was overwhelming.
maybe you should sit down.
no, I don't think I can. I should walk it off.
did you see anything?
Yeah, I did. 2 people hitting each other and some kind of fight.
OK, I want this ghost out of here.
if the ghost wants to destroy these ornaments, he can't do it himself, fire is the best way that I know to destroy something made of wood.
if I do it for him, he can cross over.
is he gone?
Yes.
come on.
Oh, I am so hungry.
they're back.
so is he.
professor payne.
go away!
I changed my mind! No student office hours today!
I'm not a student. It's melinda goldon. You helped me before.
Ow!
note to self-- stop helping people.
what are you looking for?
well, before I hit my head, I was looking for my lunch.
it's in a paper bag.
Oh. Brown-bagging lunch. That doesn't sound like you.
ms. Gordon.
all right.
what do you have for me, huh?
bunch of ambiguous questions that you probably already know the answers to?
you give me too much credit.
maybe not enough credit. Hmm?
in your studies, have you ever come across a situation where a spirit can make an object appear in our world?
Materialization?
I guess.
what I'm talking about is an object that the spirit can see and touch and that we can see and touch, too.
let's hope it's jewelry and cash then, huh?
yes or no?
look, I've heard of it, but I don't believe it.
and why not?
because I don't believe in ghosts!
how can you study this stuff and not believe in it?
I don't study the stuff, ms. Gordon.
I--I study people's need to believe in the stuff, people like you standing in front of me, looking...
wow looking beautiful.
and smelling delicious is what-- that perfume, is that french?
let me smell it.
OK, let's just assume for a minute that spirits exist and they can move objects.
Yeah.
they called apports.
it's from the french word apporter. It means "to bring.
bring what?
more of that perfume you're wearing,'cause seriously, it's making me bananas.
I'm kidding.
unless I'm not.
OK, I'm kidding.
um, it brings clarity, deeper understanding, aside from the literal, you know, interpretation that an apport is sent from beyond to the living, maybe it's a manifestation of something that's so important, you know, something really symbolic.
so if a ghost couldn't talk, they would maybe make an object appear as a way of communicating.
and can these apports move on their own?
Yeah, and cats can water-ski.
is that why they glow?
cats don't glow!
apports.
I know you're talking about apports!
why are you yelling?
I'm not yelling.
I'm yelling, right?
I make that mistake. I'm sorry. I tend to disassociate.
that's an understatement.
wh-what do you want?
why are you here?
do you have an apport at home, and it's just glowing with ghostly energy?
Whoo! Well, if that's true, why don't you bring it in so we can test it?
why would I have an apport?
I mean, there's no such thing. It's make-believe, right?
Ah. You...
you baffle me!
you little minx.
Aw, I had a feeling you'd be back.
Really?
I know a repeat customer when I see one.
still got a few things left.
any more ornaments?
no, don't worry. You've got the only ones.
I was hoping you could tell me where you got them.
Why?
in case they have any more.
well, I doubt that there are.
Yeah. Pretty unique.
well, I don't know where they came from. If I did, I'd let you know now if you excuse me, I gotta get back to my packing.
maybe the ornaments just appeared out of nowhere.
how do you mean "just appeared"?
last night, a set of ornaments just like the ones that you sold me just appeared on my kitchen table.
I thought I was going crazy.
you're not.
I racked my brain trying to remember if I picked 'em up from someone yesterday or if I saw someone drop 'em here at the stall.
what about a man in his mid-thirties, um, short, brown hair, stubble, pale skin, a little disheveled, doesn't like to look you in the eye?
shifty I tend to remember, but no, no, he's not ringing a bell.
if I see anybody like that, I'll let you know.
please.
wait.
I just found this.
I'll buy it from you.
uh, no, no, no. Y-you take it.
I--I think you should have it.
OK.
I need your real-estate expertise to find this house.
it sounds like an amazing house, but you don't remember where it is?
uh, I've never been. A client of mine told me about it.
he can't remember the address?
he's not from around here.
is he looking to buy? Do I have a shot?
uh, I'm not so sure he could swing a mortgage, but he's got me curious.
I'd love to see it.
this is the website that tracks all of the residential properties in the area.
you can go ahead and use my account number and just put in as many details as you can and then search the database and see if you find the house.
if you convince him to buy, will you steer him my way?
thank you.
well, at least now the ghost is, uh, communicating with you.
Oh, yeah. We're like this.
he won't talk to me, look at me, or even acknowledge my presence.
well, you did say it takes some longer than others to adjust to death.
Yeah. Everybody deals with death differently.
I think delia's having a hard time with it.
Oh, yeah? Did you talk to her?
I've been meaning to, but I haven't really had the chance.
Oh. That's it.
that's the house.
hello.
is anybody home?
hello.
hello.
miss.
she ok?
physically, she's fine.
she's just completely withdrawn. She won't talk.
sounds like somebody else I know.
the woman's christine nelson.
found her picture I. D Inside.
and he's, um-- well, he was dennis hightower. I don't know if that does you any good.
something terrible must have happened in this house.
I mean, do you remember the first vision I had?
2 people fighting.
I have to get him to talk to me.
look, you found his body.
maybe that's all he needed to resolve before he could cross over.
but he's still here.
Yeah, well, the police will be, too, so...
are you surprised that I found out your name?
your name.
it's really nice to meet you.
everything's gonna be ok now.
we found your body. You can cross over.
all you have to do is go into the light.
Dennis, can you see the light?
you see the light?
no. I can'T. Only you can.
is there something else that you need?
something that I can help you with?
tell me what happened to you.
what happened to you.
you know that you're dead, right?
right.
who did this to you?
you.
you.
why don't you understand me?
understand me.
coroner's report says it looks like dennis was poisoned.
why didn't he tell me about that?
maybe I'd be better off if I talked to christine.
let the police do that.
I mean, he obviously led me to her for a reason.
she might be an important part of his life.
she might be an important part of his death.
no. You think?
Dennis and christine might be the 2 people you saw fighting in your vision.
why would she poison dennis and then stay with the body?
guilty don't always run and hide.
maybe dennis led you to the house not to help christine, but to help you find his killer.
why didn't he cross over?
you're right. You should try and talk to christine.
do you have an appointment?
no. I'm, uh, looking for a patient, christine nelson.
the emergency room at mercy hospital told me that she was taken here.
this morning.
and why was she moved?
too many heads, not enough beds.
if your condition isn't serious, life-threatening, or fatal, you get turfed out.
follow me.
Christine, you have a visitor.
we met yesterday at your house.
I'm melinda gordon.
I should get back to my desk.
I know that the police were here and you wouldn't talk to them.
I'm not the police, and I need you to talk to me.
I knew dennis.
I think I know how he died, but it would help to know why.
Christine, can you hear me?
it's gonna take some time before christine's communication skills are back to where they were.
ms. Gordon ?
dr Hillary sloan.
I thought that she didn't suffer any physical damage.
she didn'T.
but this kind of change is a lot for a person with autism to process.
wait. Did you just say that christine is autistic?
do you have a minute?
as you can see, they like puzzles and games.
pacing, hand flapping, rocking back and forth they are all coping mechanisms for people with autism.
you know, there are high-functioning people with autism who've learned to behave in a more socially acceptable way.
a lot of them are loners.
they relate better to objects than hey do to people.
they don't like to talk.
look you in the eye.
they don't follow a lot of our social rules.
Dennis is autistic.
Christine and dennis had lived together since their twenties.
they were a couple.
Yes. They had a home-care worker who came over once a week.
other than that, dennis took care of her.
where did she get this?
Oh. Um, that's mine.
I sell those in my store. She must have taken it from my purse.
it's beautiful.
it was the oven.
I'm sorry?
I know how dennis died.
wait, if it was carbon monoxide poisoning, how come christine wasn't affected?
because it's her ritual every time she comes home to open up all the windows.
I saw it in a vision.
she's not a murderer.
murderess.
Touche.
question is why is dennis still here?
I found christine. She's safe.
what more is there?
what I wanna know is why is dennis still autistic.
if he's dead, he should be cured, right?
Mmm, technically, yes. Every soul is perfect.
when they cross over, the handicaps they had in life no longer affect them but if they're earthbound, sometimes they cling to the familiar.
they can't let go of who they were.
he did answer your questions at some point, didn't he?
he's been mimicking me. It's called echolalia.
it's when they echo whatever you say so you know that they can hear you, even if they can't respond.
OK, so all this time, he has been communicating with you, just in his own way.
Yes, through the ornaments.
the last one that I touched showed me how he died.
let's hope the answer to why he's still here is in one of those.
these objects, they don't vibrate any more or less than your average object.
and you can't see or hear anything coming from inside them?
like what? What, a movie? What am I gonna see, a movie?
listen to, uh, show tunes? It's wood.
it's like my head. Lady, it's normal.
there's nothing normal about them.
so your "friend" said she felt transported after she held these ornaments?
Yes.
OK. Well, I held these ornaments.
I'm still here.
what time of day did your friend say she had these visions?
why is the time of day important?
well, If she did it right after happy hour, I'd say it's very important.
I thought that's real funny. you would at least have a professional curiosity about this.
Oh, I'm curious.
I have a lot of curiosity about you, about what you're doing here.
I just wanna know if you can see anything in these ornaments.
Melinda, you haven't touched any of these ornaments since you've been here, not directly, not one.
I wanna know what happens when you touch these ornaments.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, I'd like to find out.
this one, the bunny, had a higher energy rating than the other ornaments.
what happens when you touch that guy?
you know, I thought you were a man of science, and there's nothing scientific about this.
what's more scientific than collecting my own empirical data?
what did you see?
I saw a child being taken from her mother.
are you telling me the truth?
all I can say, professor, if I could walk out of here knowing that everything we've talked about was made up, I
I would be the happiest girl on earth.
wait.
psychometry.
what you're talking about is called psychometry.
it's when you get visions or flashes of the past from touching these objects.
that makes sense.
easy for you to say.
maybe if you did some more tests on the ornaments.
I'd like to actually do some tests on you, melinda.
thanks for your time.
Melinda, I'm not talking about root canal here.
I'm talking about very scientific, controlled tests.
they could-- they can help us.
I'm not an experiment.
Melinda, listen.
when you get a chance, just come by.
come by and talk to me some more.
this is important.
I don't think it's about him. I think it's about both of them.
Oh, that's on sale, by the way.
it's like it's his memories of their life together, you know, how he died, when he first saw her.
that makes sense.
well, whatever dennis wants, it has something to do with christine somehow.
it's too bad she won't talk to you.
maybe she'll respond to the ornaments.
I thought that I would take them down to the hospital and see if it could spark anything.
besides, if I leave now, I can still make visiting hours.
well, I'd offer to mind the store, but...
it's ok.
I know that you're busy saving lives while I'm saving the dead.
Bye. See ya.
Hey.
Hey.
How'd, uh, ned do today?
Oh, I sent him home early.
Really?
what did he do now?
Oh, no. Nothing. It's fine.
it's just I had to close up. I have an errand to run.
well, don't let me keep you.
you just let me know if he causes you any trouble, ok?
you know, what I hate is when people ask if you're ok when you're so obviously not.
Yeah.
I hate that, too.
so, are you ok?
I-- no.
it's just...
I don't know. It's just been one of those days.
I am so sick of selling houses.
every time I turn around, there's this new couple buying their house for the first time.
they're arguing about where to put the office or the guest room.
and if it's not newlyweds, then it's new parents, and...
they're trying to figure out where the baby room goes.
everybody has their whole life ahead of them.
how long were you and charlie married?
sometimes it feels like we're still married.
he's been dead for 3 years now.
I've just been having such a hard time moving on.
and ned's been acting out.
I know he needs me, and I am doing everything I can to be there for him.
I understand.
Anyway--heh.
why don't you tell me your secret?
Oh, well, having work that you love takes your mind off things.
Ah. Well, my work does just the opposite.
well, maybe you should try something new.
like what?
brain surgeon? Fighter pilot?
I was thinking of something even more challenging, like...
why don't you come and work with me?
what?
I need the help really bad, and I can't pay as much as one of your sales commissions but it's a steady check every week, and I think you'd really like it.
you're serious?
Yeah.
what?
I just can't figure you out.
you're like some kind of...guardian angel or something.
promise me that you'll at least think about it.
OK.
bunny.
tree.
butterfly.
cake.
house.
bike.
rocking chair.
what do these mean to you, christine?
bunny took me to school.
she wore a butterfly around her neck.
she taught me how to ride a bike.
we sat under the tree in front of the house.
who is bunny?
who wore a butterfly necklace and took you to school?
she did.
who is she?
mommy.
mommy is she.
it's her mother.
these ornaments symbolize mommy to christine.
is that what you wanted me to do, find christine's mother?
F-find christine's mother.
I did.
Oh, no. They're faceup.
that's-- that's the wrong way.
this is a puzzle?
this is a puzzle.
that's her mother?
I believe these were meant for you.
why did you give christine away?
you have to understand that back when christine was born, people didn't know that much about autism.
can you imagine having a child that won't look at you or smile, a child that starts to cry every time you try to touch her?
I took christine to a doctor, and he told me it was my fault.
he said the reason she was autistic was because I was a bad mother.
that's terrible.
well, I wasn't the only one.
said we were refrigerator mothers because we were so cold and frigid that our children had no one to turn to for comfort, so they turned inside themselves.
so you let them take her.
I tried to see her, to visit, but they said I couldn't said if she was ever gonna get any better, I had to stay away.
didn't you see her when she was a grown-up?
once.
she was living with a young man.
he was autistic, too.
but it ended up in a fight.
leave me alone!
I saw that fight.
Wh-What?
it's not important.
what is important is that you have to try again with christine.
she needs you.
it's my baby girl, all grown up.
she's still in her own little world.
Christine, your mother's here to see you.
C-christine, it's--it's mommy.
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
it's ok.
she hears you. Just tell her how you feel.
she's not holding a grudge, and I promise that she is not angry with you.
doesn't make one bit of difference to her whether I'm here or not.
Dennis: That-- that is not true.
S-say,"love is patient.
Say,"love is patient.
you just have to be patient.
sweetheart...
Liz, liz, wait.
this was a mistake.
she needs you now more than ever.
my child doesn't need me.
she never has.
everyone needs their mother.
but she will never be able to love me, melinda.
she doesn't even know what love is.
that's not true.
Christine loves.
she just doesn't know how to show it.
her boyfriend, he was teaching her how.
you can't teach somebody how to love. They either feel it, or they don'T.
ask her.
do you love christine?
I want to, but...
I don't know how if she can't love me back.
well, then you have to show her love first, even if it means she doesn't know how to love you.
I think all dennis wants is just for you to be in christine's life again.
that's what I want, too.
thank you.
I hope this is what you wanted. This is what you wanted, right?
right.
are you ready to go?
where?
into the light. Can't you still see it?
Mm-hmm. I see the sun.
no, not the sun. The light.
the sun is the light.
I thought you could see the light.
is there something else than I can help you with?
you know what love is.
what is love?
what does it feel like?
Dennis, what you did to bring liz and christine together, that's what love is.
it's not about what we say. It's about what we do.
my name is Melinda Gordon.
I'm married,
I live in a small town and I own an antique shop.
I might be just like you
except that from the time I was a little girl
I knew that I could talk to the dead
it's all right, honey
earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.
they're stuck here because they have unfinished business with the living and they come to me for help.
in order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.
is this the house?
this is it.
great.
let me get that for you. Thank you so much.
Hi. Hi.
nice to meet you. Delia!
baster girl's are here.
cheer up. It'll be over before you know it.
Oh, I'm so happy to see you. Come on in.
I already started setting up for you.
fantastic. Thank you.
you are free to go downstairs and build something now.
I've never felt the urge to hammer something so much in my life.
here. Take this. Drink it. Relax. Go.
take out your wallets.
the bast cosmetics here.
Hey, ladies. How are you?
and I have all these fabulous products for you
and we even have products-melinda can I borrow your husband?
it'll just take a minute.
Jim, right? Yeah. But, um...
just come sit down.
now, Jim here. Have a seat
he has combination skin as anyone can see.
I have a very effective line of oil-free moisturizers for men that will balance out Jim's ph brilliantly.
if I can just find it...
Ah, here it is.
now, as you can see, it doesn't take much.
I'm basically padding the product on Jim's t-zone
here and here.
there.
I know. Isn't it a great look?
well, it was a pretty good look before you put it on, too.
well, that was fun. Thank you.
but I should go plow the north 40 now.
it's ok. Go. You're a champ.
Josie, I know you have some great stuff for all of us, too. Right?
Oh, right. Let me show you...
it's a good thing I'm comfortable with my masculinity.
that would have put me into therapy for a couple of years.
honey, what's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.
Really? Here? Where?
right in front of me.
can you see us?
how that party is over?
how about now?
ahh, it's gone.
that was beyond creepy.
Yeah, skull where my face was supposed to be.
that's not good.
is that some kind of portent of doom?
no, no.
at least I don't think so.
all right.
what about ghosts?
do you see any right now?
no. Nothing.
Hey, what's wrong?
you know what? Let's just get out of the house and go for a walk.
OK.
so, uh, have you heard from your mother yet?
she said she will call me if they can move the surgery up a day. Her poor knee.
but the good news is Josie did sell $350 worth of her stuff.
guess what the big seller was.
I don't think I want to know.
moisturizer for men.
comforting to know that if you do not do well in the medical industry, you could be a male model.
you know, you're killing me right here.
you're killing me.
I think it's great that I have a husband women find so attractive.
you know, it's funny. Cause that feeling doesn't cut both ways. Not for me.
that's because you're possessive.
guys have the whole caveman thing going on.
that's right!
I want my woman for myself.
Ooh. You got her.
all right.
good?
Hey, beautiful, where did you come from?
what do you see?
a cat.
a ghost cat?
an exotic looking one.
here, kitty-kitty
what happened?
Kitty not as cute as I thought.
go away, kitty.
where is Homer the dog when you need him?
Yeah. Where is homer?
I miss Homer.
not today's problem.
Hey, do you hear that?
No,I don't.
I don't hear anything.
how weird is that.
OK. That's just a phone.
mom.
Oh, well, that's great news!
Tuesday.
the sooner the better.
OK. No, no. I'm sorry.
Yeah. Yeah. No, it's not a problem.
OK, well, I'll call you tomorrow.
Bye, mrs. Gordon. Bye.
stop it.
now, she says, "it's just knee surgery."
there's no need to go to so much trouble.
mom?
mom?!
now what if your mother really doesn't want anyone around her right now?
well, that's too bad.
cause I'm not one to ignore dreams.
especially dreams like that one.
look, it was probably a guilt trip.
Oh, well, thank you, freud.
I'll call you as soon as I get there.
OK.
wait a minute.
don't drive crazy.
I have to go. I'll miss you.
it's my poker night anyhow.
um, that's where you're supposed to say
I'll miss you, too, honey. Yeah.
Yeah. I always do.
Hey, have the game at our house.
no, that never really works out.
why not? You guys take turns don't you?
Yeah. It's been my turn for a couple of weeks now.
and I keep trying to avoid it.
you know, unexpected visitors and such.
Hey, I'm gone. The ghosts are gone.
have the game at the house.
huh. Right. Call me.
maybe. Bye.
3 queens.
can't believe it. You've been playing queens all night.
well, what can I say, guys? The ladies love me tonight.
heh, heh. So, Clancy, game at your house?
man that almost never happens.
he wants to keep us away from Melinda doesn't trust us.
would you? Good point.
we played here a few months ago.
Yeah, when his wife was out of town.
Yeah, where is she now, Clancy? Out of town.
Yeah.
Oh, Jim Clancy, master electrician.
Hey, anybody can fix it so the lights just stay on.
dealer calls.
all around the horn.
uh, I'll go 2.
you gotta good card, man.
now that's tension.
no, I didn't do anything. I was holding them normal.
Yeah, right.
do it again.
Flaher, you ok?
got it? We got?
you in?
what? Am I in? What?
I almost just died right in front of you.
almost doesn't count. You're cold.
Hey, I'll tell you what.
it's gettin' a little late. All right...
I gotta check my tivo.
take easy Jim.
thanks for coming, guys.
who are you?
yeah?
Hey, Amarillo Slim. Did I wake you?
no. No. No. No. Well, yeah. A little.
how's your mother?
asleep.
right. Of course she would be now.
she a little worried about tomorrow?
no, she's good.
we ordered in chinese food and rented a movie.
it was nice, actually.
Ooh, can you do me a favor tomorrow and just drop in on Delia at the store?
I want to make sure she doesn't get too overwhelmed.
Delia, right. Ok.
are you-are you all right?
I was having a really weird dream.
uh. Well, welcome to my world.
Mel, you know I really love you.
I really do.
Jim, I love you, too.
listen, just go back to sleep. Ok?
call me in the morning.
thanks so much for coming in.
we're gonna be online soon. So look us up.
Hey, hey!
Hey, Jim. To what do I owe this honor?
Oh, nothing, you know. I just thought I'd drop by, say hi before work. See if everything's ok.
so Melinda was worried that I'd be overwhelmed?
Yeah. Exactly.
see? I'm getting to know her like a book.
Hey, how's her mom?
Oh, her mom should be out of surgery in a couple of minutes now.
what? What? No, no. It's
I'm so sorry! I just have this thing about bugs.
apparently so do I.
friends of yours?
houseguests.
some people have ants, other people havetermites.
you have beetles?
I don't know what I have.
did you see which way they went?
somewhere where I'll never see them again I hope.
all right, I gotta go.
I should go. Look, you have my cell, right?
and you can call me in case anything goes wrong?
Yeah. Just as long as the beetles don't form a gang and come after me, I think I'll be fine.
OK. If they do, call me.
Yeah, she sailed through the operation.
I'll feel better when I can see her.
I can't get that surgery dream out of my head.
how's your hangover?
what hangover?
Oh, come on. You were on a different planet last night.
I sensed the presence of a 6-pack at least.
you sensed the presenceof something but it wasn't alcohol related.
wait, you had a ghost last night without me?
well, something strange is going on.
last night there were lights flickering, cards flying, and there were bugs--beetles--I saw them on the floor.
they were just swimming in my shirt.
Ooh, kinky.
I'm serious.
sorry. What kind of beetles?
shiny green things.
kind of beautiful actually.
look, Mel, last night I had this dream-this weird dream
there was this girl and she was on an operating table.
same dream as mine.
not exactly.
she had a cat, which reminds me you know, you remember you saw this exotic ghost cat?
why would the cat be in your dream?
you're asking me like I know the answer.
sorry. Thinking out loud.
was there anything besides beetles?
scalpel.
as in surgery?
and sharp.
OK, this has to be about my mother.
and you know what, I'm getting a little freaked out.
so I'm gonna go in and check on her.
well, what do I do?
well, we have to find out what the connection is between the symbols.
do you remember the guy I was telling you about professor Payne?
Yeah. Yeah. The guy at rock land U.
go and see him. Ok?
he knows all about symbols and the supernatural.
he'll be able to tell you if there's a connection.
wait. I just show up there? I don't even know the guy.
no, it's ok. He's a good guy.
he just doesn't know about what I can do. So keep it all theoretical.
theoretical? I gotta go.
I love you, bye. -Theoretical.
Hey, uh, sorry, man.
I'm looking for a professor, a dr. Payne.
so are half the credit card companies in the U. S.
what can I do for you?
you're payne?
you are...
sorry. I was expecting somebody older.
why don't you come back in 25 years?
Hey, I'm Jim Clancy. I'm Melinda Gordon's husband.
you know, she comes by for help sometimes.
you're Melinda'shusband.
wow, this is really very interesting.
Yeah. She's out of town. But she sent me over
your wife fascinates me.
me, too.
look, sometimes she says you help her.
and I'm working on this project, and I was wondering if you could give me a hand.
what kind of project?
uh, I'm writing a book.
everybody's doing it these days.
Melinda told me you were a paramedic.
Yeah. I am. Yeah. See? It's a hobby.
saving lives is a hobby?
no, writing.
Oh, the writing's the hobby.
um, I'm a little lost right now.
I've been playing with all this symbolism.
cats, for instance. And I...
here you go, Melinda'shusband. Take your pick.
how about that one?
excellent. Abyssinian.
Egyptian. Very spookylooking, huh?
you know, the ancient egyptians, they were crazy about cats, Jim.
if you killed a cat, you had to be killed.
if your cat died, you went into mourning.
you had to shave off your eyebrows while in mourning.
that must-that must have been a fantastic look.
right.
OK. What if in this story I throw in some beetles, what would that startto signify?
well, that would depend.
on what?
on the beetle. I've always been partial to George.
I'm joking. That's a joke.
guess Melinda hasn't told you a lot about me.
Nope. No, no. She just said you were a great guy.
well, then you've been sadly misinformed.
what color are these beetles?
green. And they're shiny.
green? Those are scarabs.
there's a lot of egyptian symbolism in your book.
could be. Ok. Right.
Well...egyptians, scarabs, here you go.
dung beetles. That one.
used a lot in egyptian iconography, usually symbolizing regeneration and rebirth.
right. So if I was-uh, if my main character was seeing
getting sent these symbols, what do you think that would mean?
could mean a lot of things. It could mean beauty, egypt.
it could mean the goddess Isis, she's the most powerful, most popular.
but you have cats. That's a powerful motif.
that would make me think of the goddess bast.
bast was the protector of cats and women.
did you just say "bast"?
bast, yeah. Just now.
bast cosmetics. Do you know bast cosmetics?
cosmetics? I'm not, um...
that's not my area of expertise.
you know, Doc, you helped me a lot. I owe you one. Thanks.
you're leaving? Wait.
do you guys do this all the time, the two of you?
what?
the whole I'm saying something, but I'm not tell you what I mean.
I'm being wacky and evasive thing. Do you both do it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
ye. Like that. That's--that's good.
Yeah.
what do you want?
so the ghost is attached to bast cosmetics?
bast is all about beauty.
she was the protector of cats.
and their logo is a beetle and a cat.
so, this girl from your dream...
what was she like?
scary.
was she beautiful?
she wasn't exactly homely.
she's drop dead gorgeous. She looks like a model.
a simple yes would have done.
Hey, hey, you just said
look, how many times exactly have your dreamt of this drop dead gorgeous model?
Mel, I want the dreams to end just as much as you do.
OK. Well obviously your visions and dreams have nothing to do with my mother.
so she must be connected to bast cosmetics.
maybe she's a model.
was one of their models.
dead? Don't you think?
well, then why is she coming to me?
I don't know. Maybe she was attached to somebody at the makeover party.
Oh, thank you.
or maybe she's using you to get to me.
all right, well, how do we find her?
I don't know. Bast is a small company. But they still advertise.
so you'll have to go to a news stand, get some magazines, and look for her picture.
I'll talk to you later. Come back soon.
Bye.
there you are.
do you have Smith Sonian?
uh, yeah, it's over there behind national geographic.
excuse me. Sorry.
ahh, you're...
Jim--Melinda's husband.
right. And you're dr. Payne, right?
Yes, I am. How's the book coming?
slowly.
OK. That's one les angelique, one fashion today, one wardrobe plus, one tween chique magazine.
anything else?
no, thanks.
Melinda's still out of town.
she's coming back soon.
$750?
I know it's a lot. But it's totally worth it.
this woman will come and do all your colors.
what you look best in. What's you power color.
what's your calming color.
so what's your throw away money color?
Wait-isn't that Melinda's husband?
nice set way.
Hey, well, if itisn't my guine a pig.
hope you're using that moisturizer.
Yeah. All the guys in the firehouse have noticed a big difference.
Jim, have you ever thought about having your colors done?
sorry?
pay no attention.
Hey, guys, I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
you probably know more about this kind of stuff than I do.
do you know who she is?
Oh, my god.
that's Eva Turner.
I-I'm sorry but that just caught me by surprise.
Eva--Eva was a friend of mine.
was?
Yeah, she died a couple of weeks ago.
and why do you ask?
uh, a friend of mine
one of the guys at the firehouse he's, uh, he's really into models and especially her.
so, when I saw the bast cosmetics,
I thought maybe I could get an address.
he wanted to send a fan letter. That kind of thing.
Oh, well. She used to live in my building.
she was the one that got me into selling bast cosmetics.
she was so nice.
how did she die?
ahh, that's the horrible thing.
you know, she went in for an appendectomy, a routine.
something went wrong with the anesthesia, and she just died.
we're going to the memorial tomorrow in the city.
Oh, yeah. Where?
all saints chapel.
sorry to interrupt your lunch.
and sorry about that. See ya, Delia.
take care, Jim.
died during surgery?
well, that explains the hospital dreams and the scalpel appearing.
Yeah, there's a memorial service tomorrow in the city, at a chapel.
and in your dreams?
exactly. People praying.
well, she wants you to go to that memorial.
there's something or someone there you're supposed to see.
don't you think it'll look a little strange, I mean, if I go?
Yeah, if you go alone, so take somebody with you and blend in.
who?
dude, I'll tell you, this is a little weird.
I don't even know the deceased.
I know. Think of it as show of support.
Oh.
that's like something from e! Channel.
are you--do you knowthese people?
not exactly.
lookin' for someone?
not really.
you have some parallel life you haven't told me about?
I mean, are you an underwear model by night or something?
Flaher, just go with me on this one, ok?
remember, I saved your life the other night.
Who-Who's that?-Who?
other side of the aisle, purple.
looks familiar.
that's Delia.
Delia Banks. She works with Melinda at the store.
Linda's a beautiful woman.
funny, but I know her.
who?
that woman.
she lived in the town I grew up in.
I used to mow their lawn.
that is, that's Eva kaminsky.
I know this girl.
isn't that why we're here?
right.
it's just, I went to high school with her and she was...
really shy.
it's hard to imagine that...
that girl turned into that girl.
please be seated.
I am Marybeth Kaminsky, Eva's mother.
thank you all so much for coming.
Eva would be very happy to know so many people came for her.
a child shouldn't ever die before their mother.
no one's child.
Eva was the light of our lives.
she was so beautiful, not just on the outside, but on the inside, too.
I remember
surprised to see you here, Jim.
look at you. You grew up so nice!
Thanks. How's your mother?
she's good, thanks for asking.
Oh, you're welcome.
she moved on up a couple of years ago, I think.
well, that's nice.
I cannot tell you how sorry I am about Eva.
I didn't even know she was going into the hospital.
I mean, she was always so terrified of doctors and hospitals and...
she probably just, didn't want us to be worried, so...
remember how she was always obsessed with people's feelings?
I just remember her being very shy.
but she made us so proud. I mean, to open a magazine and see her right in there.
so beautiful, so confident.
just exactly the way I wanted her to be.
I...I never thought she'd go so far.
Linda's the one I thought would bein the spotlight.
Jim clancy. Hi.
what a surprise.
Eva would so love that you came.
you know, I don't think she'd even remember me.
Oh, she would. She talked about you.
she said you gave her a great gift.
well, listen, I really have to get back to Upton.
I don't like to come into the city very much 'cause it really makesme kinda nervous, so...
so good to see you. Bye.
please come visit us.-I will.
Hey. Hey.
sorry. Thank you.
Hey, can I ask you-who's that woman?
Oh, that's Diana Lassiter.
she was Eva's agent.
she's mine now, too.
OK, so, you're a model, too?
soon, I hope.
I've got a lot of head shots out there.
did you get a lot of help from your sister?
everything.
she had the whole thing down.
she was totally focused.
that's good, I guess.
Yeah, she overcame a lot.
she, uh, fought really hard.
mostly with herself, but...
she came out on top.
she gave herself that power, you know?
and then this happened.
I better get back to my mother.
thank you. I hope you come see us soon.
take care, Linda.
I'll see you later.
you're Jim's friend.
Yeah, Tim Flaherty.
you're Delia Banks, right?
that's right. Nice of you to come.
Yeah, well, I
you must be in hog heaven here.
come again?
I mean, with all the models.
Jim told me you had a thing for models.
Oh, Jim told you.
too skinny.
Really?
Mrs. Lassiter, I'm from Eva's hometown.
I've never met anyone from Eva's real life.
I didn't really know her.
I used to work for her parents when I was young, mowing lawns, things like that.
I hadn't actually seen her since I moved away.
Oh. She was a friend and a client for about 5 years.
Hey, uh, you represent her--her sister Linda, right?
well, we'll see if she has what it takes. She might.
she's certainly beautiful.
Yeah, she's that, but, um, it takes more than that.
it takes a certain toughness.
did Eva have that?
I mean, that toughness?
look, I loved eva like a sister, but...
she was a bit of a wreck.
a wreck?
you know, I think she might have been a little freaked out that her sister was gonna be a model.
you know, I think maybe Eva thought that she'd replace her.
how could she worry about being old when she wasn't even 30?
she's practically a senior citizen in this business, honey.
there was something more than that, though.
she was trying to prove something to somebody, and the more successful she got, the more she was afraid of losing it.
I've seen it happen.
thanks for your time.
it was nicet alking to you.
and you. Take care.
if you're here, I wish I could help you.
I wish I knew what you wanted...
what you needed.
I don't even know why you remember me.
you were just a kid.
you were too shy to even say hello.
Hi. I'm Jim Clancy.
you wanna dance? come on.
you're the prettiest girl here. Don't forget that.
you were the first person who made me feel pretty.
Jim, I'm home.
I didn't even remember it.
well, obviously she did.
how can a ghost put something like that in my head?
she has a strong connection with you.
sometimes we have no idea the effect we can have on other people.
you know, it's things that we forget are turning points for someone else.
you were a kind man, even then.
OK.
all right, we know why she's coming to me, but we still don't know what she wants.
well, what did her mother say at the memorial?
her mother didn't even know she was in the hospital.
she thinks Eva didn't want her to worry.
so, maybe she just wants to apologize to her mother.
I think it's more than that.
in the chapel, when her mother was speaking, the doors blew open, there was all this wind.
you know, it was like she didn't want her to finish.
hmm, that kind of wind usually means that a ghost is mad, so maybe she led you to her mother, and not just to apologize.
Yeah, but what do we do?
it's your ghost, what do you think?
go see her mother.
good, all right. Hopefully Eva will be there and we'll get this whole thing sorted out.
have I told you how glad I am that you're back?
you can show me.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Oh, thank you.
um, you really didn't have to come all this way just to say that.
actually, Marybeth, there's another reason we're here.
um, this may sound strange or funny, even, but I think...
we think Eva's still here.
Yes, I know. She'll--she'll always be here with us.
um, we mean literally.
are you saying what I think you're saying?
ask her to say all those nice things about me again.
uh, she's here.
OK, look, if you guys are trying to comfort me, it's really not working, and, in fact,
I think it's reallya little creepy, so
she wants you to say some more nice things about her.
Yeah. What?
I want to hear more.
except she did leave a few things out.
she's talking about the memorial.
she says that you left a few things out when you talked about her.
Oh! This is ridiculous. I have to go.
she didn't mention how she used to tell me how I shouldn't expect too much from life because homely girls had it hard.
she feels like you criticized her.
how are you doing this?
what is this?
Eva's here with us. Right now.
why'd you do that to me, mom?
why'd you tell me my nose looked too big in pictures?
not that I'd ever be as beautiful as linda, but so at least I could be presentable!
she feels like you compared her to Linda.
I never criticized her.
Yeah, I was hard on her, but look at the career she had because I pushed her never to be satisfied.
she's just trying to tell you that you made her feel bad about herself.
they were only words.
they might have just been words, mom, but I believed in every single one of them because they came from you.
what the hell's going on here?
didn't you know I just wanted to be seen as beautiful in your eyes?
I tried to change everything about myself to please you until there was nothing left for you to criticize!
she can't hear you.
you said that you wanted to change everything about yourself.
you didn't go into the hospital to have an appendectomy, did you?
Diana knows the truth.
she helped me.
I, um...
I know you were friends with Eva back in the day, but what you're asking for is some very private information.
all right, that's true, but...it's important to me, and to us, to her family.
we think we know what happened.
we just want you to confirm it.
I don't know if it's even ethical.
your client's dead.
if you can shed some light on that, or give her family some closure, how could that not be ethical?
did you know Eva?
I've met her.
what do you think it happened?
I think she went to a hospital for plastic surgery and something went wrong.
how did you find out?
it's not important right now.
I tried to tell her not to do it, that she didn't need it, but she was never satisfied with her looks, never.
all right, but what went wrong in the surgery?
Eva was on diet pills. She didn't tell the doctor.
she had a bad reaction to the anesthetic.
well, thank you for being honest with us.
Diana, I know that you're trying to protect Eva, but you have to tell her family.
Oh, po--why keep that wound open? Why not just let them heal?
the truth heals, and they deserve to know.
and there's one more thing.
what?
we have to be with you when you tell them.
I can't believe she didn't tell us about this.
I'm sorry. I would have told you sooner, but I wanted to respect her privacy.
and then Melinda and Jim thought you had a right to know.
I want Diana to tell my sister something.
Diana, Eva wants you to tell Linda something.
what? I'm--I'm sorry? What is this?
she's here with us.
what is she talking about?
she wants you to tell Linda about the pills.
well, I--yeah, I told you.
she was on diet pills, and she forgot to tell
she didn't tell the doctor.
and Diana told me not to tell him.
she told me he wouldn't do the surgery if he knew.
you told her that the doctor would refuse the operation if he knew about the pills.
and it was the pills and the anesthesia that killed her.
you also told her that it would add 10 years to her career.
excuse me, are you tryingto blame me for this?
she wanted that surgery. She wanted it.
she's not trying to blame anyone.
I just don't want my sister to buy into this.
I don't want her to listen to Diana.
she's worried about you.
she doesn't want you to listen to Diana or anyone.
Just...listen to yourself.
but I wanted to be like Eva.
that's all I was trying to do.
she overcame everything.
I overcame nothing.
I never looked inside.
I turned myself into what other people wanted me to be.
she's saying that she hasn't overcome anything.
she just became who other people wanted her to be.
no, that's not true.
when I realized I was dead,
I didn't remember the money or the magazines or even my own face.
I remembered that one sweet moment at the high school dance.
and when she dies, I want her to leave behind a life full of real things.
I want her to live from the inside.
can you tell her that?
I promise.
is that where I'm supposed to go?
she sees the light.
she's ready to cross over now.
she's here, I can feel her.
she's gonna be ok.
Yes, she is.
Eva, for whatever its worth...
I spoke to your mother at the memorial service, and...I saw how much she loved you.
how proud she was of you, I saw it in her eyes.
it was real.
well, it's time to say good-bye.
take care, Eva.
well...
I think that you and I should talk.
please.
you know,
I've said it before, and I'll say it again.
I don't know how you do this on a daily basis.
I feel like
I need to lie down for 6 weeks.
Yeah, well, my ghosts aren't quite as fascinating as yours.
Oh, yeah, fascinating.
I'm sure am gonna miss the beetles and the scalpels.
Oh, and the tearing off of faces, I'll agree.
Oh, well. At least she was easy on the eyes.
Yep. That she was.
but the most beautiful woman in my world...
is right here.
she's pretty easy on the eyes.
welcome home, dream girl.
my name is Melinda Gordon.
I'm married,
I live in a small town, and I own an antique shop.
I might be just like you.
except that from the time I was a little girl,
I knew that I could talk to the dead.
it's all right, honey.
earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.
they're stuck here because they have unfinished business with the living and they come to me for help.
in order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.
anyway so the great thing about antiques is their connection with the past and all the stories behind them.
um, vintage is really hot right now.
and I sell tons of these 1930s bed jackets.
this one actually belonged to the Thelma Sedgwick estate.
but most importantly, ladies, it looks hot with a pair of jeans.
Oh. You.
so, like, how much money do you make?
you know what? Actually, that's a great question.
thank god that is over!
Ah, come on. That was fun.
if I didn't have to work nights all week,
I'd come back tomorrow.
Ooh, listen to you, Mr. Big man on campus.
I'd rather poke myself in the eye than have to go back in there.
ha ha. It sounds like you had a rough crowd.
no. It's just I don't think they got the concept, you know?
antique to them is an mp3 player with no video screen.
so how did your real estate talk do?
great. I just hooked them with "you can make $1 million before you're 30" line.
it worked. - Nice.
Oh, isn't that, uh--oh, shit. I forgot her name.
the new girl.
right. Village Java.
uh, you have a little mocha right there.
that's her lipstick, stupid.
Oh, my bad.
see, that's how I pictured you in high school.
not quite.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!
do it.
they did it to you.
it can't be broken.
we're already down two girls and semifinals are days away.
tell him!
OK, let's not panic until we get an x-ray.
it might just be sprained.
this is your fault. You pushed me!
OK, I don't think anyone-- - I wasn't even close to you.
did you see what happened?
Yeah. Kind of. It looked like an accident.
didn't I see you in the cafeteria this morning?
I'm here for career week. Melinda Gordon.
Jackie Boyd. I coach cheerleading.
you think she's out?
well, it's not just her.
we've had two other accidents these last two weeks.
three girls down now.
makes for kind of a lopsided pyramid.
OK, people, you all have better things to do so go do them.
there you go. One dry half-caf.
Thanks.
uh, what was your name?
Oh. Madison, Maddy. Either one.
Oh.
are you ok?
Yeah, the--the coffee was hot.
Oh. Sorry.
Oh, jeez.
voodoo girl's working.
what about that accident with the cheerleader?
that was kind of freaky, huh?
screw it. I've got chem lab. I need my buzz.
um, no, not really.
I mean, that's why there's seat belt laws.
two non-fat capps, please.
and could you maybe make those better than that piss water you gave me yesterday?
sure. I'd be delighted to.
talk about a walking fashion faux pas.
I mean, that nose thing.
fine, we can deal with that.
Oh, my-- - I'm so-- so sorry.
I don't know how that happened. - Do you know how much this costs?
Oh, my god. You are gonna pay for that. - I don't know how that happened.
Hey! Hi! How's your cheerleader?
which one? The one that fell out of the moving car or the one that fell 10 feet off the bleachers?
well, I was gonna see if I could come by your practice, but maybe now is not a good time.
no. Maybe you should.
it might be good for the girls to have an audience.
smile, girls!
think energy!
do it again.
do it.
do it.
5, 6. Come on, girls.
do it!
sharp, girls!
all right. Let's do it again...
watch out!
Oh, my god.
why are you doing this? I can help you.
they did it to me.
you are so dead.
Hey, I didn't do anything, except for stand here watching you being lame.
go, team. Rah, rah.
look, Maddy. Whatever creepy mojo you're into, it's not gonna work.
I don't care how many lizard heads you bite off.
we're going to regionals.
just let it go. Don't stress.
you're right Curt. We wouldn't want her to stress.
she might mess her hair.
you ever think all this bad luck is just karma for you bagging your dead friend's guy?
you know what? She is so noxious. Ok?
she's not worth it. She never was.
you had a cheerleader die recently.
Yeah. Tais.
just about this time last year.
it was an accident.
a cheerleading accident?
no, it was really a freak thing.
she got locked in the boiler room.
she died trying to get out.
do you know why she was down there?
I'm not sure, but it's kind of a hangout.
well, it was.
since the accident, no one goes down there.
why are you asking?
it's just that grief can come out in such weird ways.
I'm sure that all of this has really thrown the team.
I know a little bit about grief, too.
and sometimes the best thing we do is to just keep focused and work your butt off.
get through it.
that's what I try to teach these girls anyway.
maybe they need another outlet.
look, they've had counseling. They've had time off.
all they need to do is focus now.
Hey, you know, it was intense, what happened with Rana and Maddy. What's up?
I give up trying to figure out these girls' social lives, but clearly, Maddy's one that just doesn't fit in.
Melinda, I heard about what happened today.
you did?
you can tell me. Is it true?
is what true?
that you're a total freak!
freak!
freak.
a total freak.
freak!
Hey! Open up!
Tais, what happened down here?
please. I want to help you.
I want justice!
Oh! I'm sorry. - Sorry.
that was my fault.
no. It's fine.
Hey, uh, you're that antique chick, right?
Yeah. It pretty much feels that way.
way to keep going, even though nobody was listening.
awesome.
um, can I ask you a question?
OK.
well, according to Maddy, you were Tais' boyfriend.
so why do you think all these accidents are happening?
uh, I don't know.
I guess everybody's still a little freaked out, especially Rana.
Especially?
Yeah. They were, like, best friends.
you know, really tight.
and now you're going out with Rana?
well, yeah. But it wasn't like
I didn't--I didn't mean it that way.
um, is that a yearbook?
Yeah.
can I borrow it?
sure. What for?
well, because, you know, I'm asking and you're a nice guy who wants to help out the antique chick.
cool.
cool.
cutest Pose Rana Thomas, Tais Baker, Maddy Strom
do it.
do it! Do it...
what's happening?
do it!
why are you doing this? What do you want?
who are you talking to?
do it to them.
they did it to you.
do it to them. They did it to you?
what does that mean?
OK. Why are you doing our justice cheer?
do it. Do it.
do it. Do it. Do it.
do it! Do it!
that'll get you some air. Come on!
let's get out of here.
don't talk--talk to me! You're a freak.
what the hell is this?
N--no one else was in there.
OK. I'm sorry about all this.
I'll figure it out, ok?
Yeah. - All right.
see you tomorrow.
she's a little freaked out.
Yeah. I imagine she would be.
how did you get to be in the locker room?
I was in the gym, and I heard her screaming.
what were you doing in the gym?
wait a minute.
you're not thinking...
I don't know what I'm thinking.
rana said you were talking to someone, but there was no one else there.
it may have appeared that way, but
look, Melinda, I appreciate it if you're trying to help.
but how about you just stick to career week, ok?
sorry.
what's the justice cheer?
Why?
rana was saying it before.
she was upset so I thought maybe it made her feel better.
it's a football cheer, when we're losing.
push it, push it, push it on through.
do it to them like they did it to you.
curt said that Tais and Rana were best friends.
why is Tais attacking her?
you said Curt's going out with rana now. Case closed.
I don't think so. Otherwise she'd be going after curt, too. And she isn't.
but there is the goth girl--Maddy.
and Rana accused her of being into some kind of creepy mojo stuff.
you know, maybe Maddy is into some kind of witchcraft.
what, do we believe in witchcraft now?
who am I not to believe in anything?
besides, it would explain why Tais is hanging out with the social outcasts and attacking her best friend.
Ah, high school--it makes Washington politics look like preschool.
there's not much else I can do at the high school.
you should have seen the way the coach looked at me, like I was a total freak.
and that's how I felt, you know, like a total freak.
I was right back in my old high school, and everybody was looking at me like I have two heads.
I've seen your high school pictures.
in fact, I've looked at them quite a lot.
you were never a freak.
a big nerd maybe, but not a freak.
you're really good at comforting me.
anytime. You want some more tea?
sure. - Ok.
please, you gotta help me.
Peggy will fail science if I don't get it turned in.
OK, not now.
you know, she's a nice girl, and she's not very science-minded, but, oh, man.
she's cute!
no, it's in my locker right there.
right there. It's in my locker.
she needs it right now. 5-22-10!
say it. 5-22-10.
OK, I am not your errand girl, all right?
now, go into that light.
there are some very nice non-science-minded girls in there.
so just shoo, please.
Melinda? Who are you talking to?
you ok?
Yeah, sorry. I just drifted for a minute.
all right. I'm going to go up.
OK. I'll be up soon.
I just don't know how this is any of your business.
you know what?
it's not. But I'm asking anyway.
Jackie told me that you and Tais were friends.
so? I was stupid once.
you think I locked her in the boiler room?
did you?
Uh-huh. Yeah. Killed her dead.
good riddance, too.
Wow. You know, I am impressed by how tough you are.
but I am just trying to find out what happened before Tais died and if it has anything to do with what's happening now.
I thought we were friends.
I was wrong.
so why did you join the team?
I was into dance.
modern stuff, my own choreography.
I was doing a piece one day on the field.
it was my second week, when nobody even talked to me.
but Tais, she saw what I was doing and asked me to be on the team just like that.
is that when you became friends?
Tais was the only one who never treated me like I was a freak.
and if you're cool with Tais then you're in.
everyone liked my house the best because my dad let us stay up late and eat junk food.
it was the best when it was just the three of us.
we'd read out of our journals and talk about everything
what boys we liked, school problems with our families, our deepest, darkest secrets.
man, I really trusted them.
I was popular. I had friends.
and I was really good at something.
and then I woke up.
and it was all just a dream.
the end.
so what happened?
why'd you wake up?
you ask too many questions.
Bye.
fire, water, moon, and sun.
we come to you all as one.
the wrath and ire that she creates return to her a crueler fate.
fire, water, moon, and sun.
we come to you all as one.
the wrath and ire that she creates return to her a crueler fate.
they left me to die.
you have no idea which of those girls was burned in effigy last night?
whoever it is is Maddy's next target.
all right, so...
a group of outcasts get together to put hexes on cheerleaders.
you know, if word gets out, this could be a pretty popular teen sport.
ha ha. Except these girls are clueless, because it's not spells that are bringing down cheerleaders. Tais is.
but why would Tais want to hurt her friends?
I don't know. Maybe she thinks they're responsible for her death.
Oh.
you think those herbal pouches they found in the boiler room have something to do with it?
doubt it.
Maddy didn't want Tais to be a part of her ritual.
in fact, she didn't even know that she was there.
but she did mean to hurt cheerleaders.
right. So maybe her coven's angry energy is influencing Tais somehow.
look, if they were down there in the boiler room with those herbs, maybe Tais attached herself to them there.
so the justice that Tais is looking for is about Maddy and her friends, not her.
that's because she didn't read the first rule of the wiccan faith
do no harm to others.
OK, well, maybe this is the teen angst version of wicca.
Oh, my god.
come on. I'm fine.
drop it. You're not working out on that leg.
call 911.
Rebecca, becca, don't move!
Jackie! Jackie, what happened?
a girl fell in practice.
she was out for a few minutes but they think she'll be ok.
I'm so sorry.
I should have canceled the season before it got this bad.
I don't think that would've helped.
you know, you said something to me before that you know something about grief.
I lost my little brother 5 years ago.
he was only 9.
and I never let myself stop to think about it.
never. I took this job, tried to make a difference.
I kept busy.
and I thought the same thing should happen with these girls, you know, that they'd get over it quicker if they just kept moving forward.
Jackie, everybody has to feel their feelings, no matter how much it hurts.
I feel them, all right. I just don't talk about them.
and I guess I expected the same thing with these girls, you know, for them to just suck it up and go on.
I told them Tais was the heart of the team and they were the soul.
well, you were right about that.
and you did get these girls to the semi-finals.
so there is something good in all of this.
Yeah, beat up, demoralized, and wondering who's gonna fall on their ass next.
way to go, Jackie.
you know what? This is not your fault.
OK? Maybe there is just some bad energy around the team.
not for long.
cut the crap. I know what you're doing.
I'm a dabbler in the spirit world myself.
Oh. You wiccan?
I don't think so.
except I skipped witchcraft and went straight to seeing dead people.
I saw Tais' spirit in your fire.
Oh, see, now I know you're full of it because if Tais was here, we'd be the last people she'd hang with.
it's not your hexes that are hurting cheerleaders. Tais is.
well, if that is true, that is, like, really beautiful.
that is like the ultimate poetic justice.
your negative energy is like a drug to Tais.
and I'm asking you to stop until I can cross her over.
why should I help Tais?
because if you don't, you're no better than them.
that girl turned on me and all the others.
Maddy, please don't do this.
try and stop me.
Jackie told me that you didn't really want to talk to me.
are you serious?
in the locker room, you were, like, totally talking to yourself.
then you went all rambo and broke that window.
what do you think is going on, Rana?
do you think Maddy's doing something?
Maddy is like the devil, ok?
she was totally normal one day, and then she's out of, like a Tim Burton movie the next.
right. After you guys turned on her.
Yeah. How good a move was that!
it was like I saw the writing on the tea leaves.
I think you mean the writing on the wall.
what are you, my English teacher now?
whatever. I just know that as we speak, Maddy's probably sticking some big pin into a doll with my name on it.
what happened with you and Maddy, with everybody and Maddy?
you mean, why did we kick her off the team?
well, I got the feeling that she quit.
in her dreams. We totally exited Maddy because of what an enormous liar she turned out to be.
we'd just found out that we'd made the semifinals.
Maddy was supposed to fly out to France for the break, but we were so psyched that we wanted to tell her, catch her beforehand.
we were totally floored by what happened next.
Mr. Strom?
dad! That was Mrs. Frawley.
she wants you to send the car...to the airport.
the place wasn't even theirs.
her dad was like Jeeves the butler or whatever.
you know, it was just some rich family's summer house.
I totally lost all respect for her after that.
because she wasn't rich?
no. Well, yeah, but, I mean, come on.
she was poor, but I could have gotten over that.
you know, I'm not a total bitch.
so what was it really?
I mean, I trusted her. I told her everything.
and she lied to my face.
our entire friendship was just a big fake-out.
I couldn't be friends with her after that.
neither could Tais.
must be nice to be so sure about everything.
not always.
it just got me.
OK, I know it's wrong that Maddy lied, but I don't think those girls would have been friends with her if she hadn't.
and if those girls just cared more about who people were and less about what they look like or how much money they had or if they made fools of themselves in a hallway.
I'm sorry. They're just so cavalier.
they have no idea how much pain they inflict, you know, when you're already at your most vulnerable in life.
you know, I wish I had known you back then.
I'd have kicked some ass and taken names.
you would have, wouldn't you?
Hey, tell me what you're doing before I have to go.
remember those herb pouches that I found at the boiler room?
well, I did a search on all the witchcraft and spell sites, because I thought maybe it was a curse, but nothing was coming up.
so then I did a broader search.
well, that doesn't make any sense.
or maybe it does.
look, I don't have anything else to say to you.
I found this in the boiler room, and I thought maybe you had put it there.
good going, Sherlock.
I didn't really know why until I looked up what it meant
a spell for forgiveness.
rana told me about the lie you tried to pull off with them.
is that what you needed forgiveness for, or was it something else?
did you do something to Tais?
look, I didn't ask to be in their stupid clique.
they invited me.
what did you do to Tais?
what did you need forgiveness for down in that boiler room?
Tais sent me a note before she died.
she said that she wanted to meet up and talk, that our friendship was too important to lose over something so petty.
so what happened?
I never went.
I was too mad or ashamed or just messed up.
I never went, and Tais died down there waiting for me.
so you didn't actually do anything to Tais.
no. And, you know, I don't care if you believe me or not.
I'm just really sick of the whole thing.
I'm not going back out there. I'm done with the spells.
I've made my point.
if you want Tais to move on, tell her to move on, ok?
all right. That's it. I want to talk to you this instant!
Wow. You sound like my mom.
you can stop now, ok?
Maddy broke up the coven. She's really over it.
and you may still be feeling negative energy but it'll wear off.
that is so random.
like Maddy has anything to do with why I'm here.
you're feeding off of her energy.
all of the goth girls, their anger is giving you strength.
Yeah. Right.
why would you go after them?
I mean, they were your friends, your own kind.
no. I hate them. I hate them all.
rana, come on.
rana, don't.
wait!
Hey! Rana!
Oh, no! Ugh!
Hey! Hey!
OK, people, let's go! Let's go!
let's go! Let's go do this!
let's take this one home.
people, 1, 2, 3!
Rana! Rana, help!
they left me in there to die.
they didn't care, especially not Rana.
took my boyfriend, the team...
Maddy was the only one who cared.
I felt badly about how I treated Maddy.
OK, so all you have to do now is tell Maddy that.
she'll be really happy, believe me.
she feels like she's responsible.
I know who's responsible.
and Rana knows.
and all those pretty cheerleaders, they're never going to be champions without me.
is that what this is about?
you didn't get your chance, so they don't have theirs?
this is about justice.
and I'm just doing to them what they did to me.
this better be good.
I don't get up this early for anybody.
it's important. I don't want one of your girls to get hurt before the semi-finals.
is that what you think, that the girls are caving under pressure?
Yeah. Something like that.
I need you to get a hold of Rana and Maddy.
they'll be here in 30 minutes.
OK. And I need you to tell them to meet us in the boiler room.
and I need you to have a little faith.
OK. No one else is getting hurt.
it's time to solve this.
rana, I need you to tell me what went wrong between you and Tais.
you think I had something to do with
rana, this is not Judge Judy.
just tell the girl what she wants to know.
we had a fight. So what?
fine. I don't need you guys.
you want to be that way, I'm out.
I don't need you.
good riddance.
the last thing we need is a fake we can't trust.
it's true, Maddy.
I like you, but the trust isn't there.
when we fly into the air, we need to know someone will be there to catch us.
that's bull! When you guys thought I was rich you didn't worry about me catching you.
you're kicking me off the team because I'm not like you.
and I am so glad.
screw you both.
we weren't too hard on her, were we?
Maddy, what happened next?
I, um, I got a note from Tais to meet her here.
but I didn't go.
but Rana did.
I sent them both notes.
they were both supposed to meet me there just like now.
you got a letter, too, didn't you?
how did you know?
remember what I told to you, you were gonna have to have some faith?
OK.
Tais is here with us right now in spirit.
you freak! You brought her ghost back.
stop it.
Tais is here, but not because of Maddy.
ask her to tell what happened next.
she wants you to tell us all what happened after you got the note.
I figured Tais wanted to give me a pep talk before the competition.
but it wasn't a pep talk. It was worse
I think we need to let Maddy back on the team.
are you bent? Why?
we need her, for one thing.
look at the moves she gave us. Look
she is a loser, Tais. She lied to us!
because she knew we wouldn't even talk to her if we knew the truth.
Oh, so now you're, like, taking her side?
it's not about sides, Rana. I liked her.
she was kind of cool.
she's different.
so Tais liked me because I was different?
you were special, not like the other girls.
you were smart and quirky.
she's saying that you were unique.
there was no one else like you and she missed you.
OK, I'm sorry. You lost me at "Tais is here."
I'll try and explain it later. Just go with me.
it's true. She is here.
I--I can feel her.
she's not angry anymore. That's why you can feel her.
Tais, we were friends for so long.
I just--I wanted you all to myself.
I wanted to be your best friend.
no way! I am not letting her back in!
she's our friend.
you better figure out who your real friends really are, Tais.
rana, come on.
rana, don't.
wait.
I didn't know that the door would lock behind me.
I didn't know...
until they told me they found her.
I didn't tell the police because I was so messed up.
it was all my fault.
it was an accident?
Yes.
Wow. Just a stupid accident.
what have I been doing?
it's not your fault.
you were stuck in the middle of something that never should've even happened.
it's not their fault either.
please tell them that.
I don't blame them.
she's saying that she doesn't blame either one of you.
she knows it was an accident.
all I wanted was for us to be like before.
I could never have as good a friend as Rana.
she just wanted everything to be the way it was.
she could have never replaced you as her friend.
tell Maddy that I loved who she was, how her mind worked.
when we talked about stuff, I felt smart.
and she really liked who you were, not who you were trying to be.
Tais, I
I thought you were so special, and I...
I just miss you.
when we were friends, I felt like I could do anything.
you can.
Wow. It's so awesome.
she sees a light. She's ready to cross over now.
No! No, she can't go yet.
I need to say that I'm sorry.
and I was stupid and lame.
and if I could take it all back, I swear
tell her it's ok.
tell her she's a really good person and it's ok to let others see it.
I will.
what?
there's a little boy here.
a little boy?
he says his name is Sean.
do either one of you know a Sean?
my brother
my baby brother.
he wants me to tell his sister that he loves her and he's happy.
and he wants her to be happy, too.
he says he loves you...
and that he knows that you're sad but that you don't have to be, because he isn't.
you--you see my brother?
I don't. Tais does. He's in the light.
that's where he should be.
I'd like to introduce the reigning state champion cheerleading team
the Grandview Tigers--with an assist in choreography by Maddy Strom!
nobody move!
what are you doing?
my inhaler!
Aah!
anybody else want to be a hero?
Yeah, I didn't think so.
get up! Back room!
anybody even twitches, I'll shoot him.
you ok? - Yeah.
you? - Ok.
did I hear you say something?
I told you not to look at me.
now, you all have a wonderful day now.
what else did you remember?
he was tall, intimidating.
I feel much better. Thanks.
is there anybody who can drive you home?
Oh, yeah. My wife--lynn.
if you find that bag of jewelry, can you look for this art deco ring?
it had emeralds in it. It was, um...
my engagement ring.
I will.
Hey, Barrett. - Excuse me.
excuse me. - Mm-hmm.
how are we all doing?
we're fine. I'm just a little shaken up.
I'm really glad you're here.
this is crazy.
Hey, you want me to take over for a little bit before I go?
no, I'm good. It's actually kind of therapeutic.
remind me--we moved to Grandview because it was quiet and safe?
and you know what? It's been a long time since anything living scared me like that.
I hate that you had to go through that.
is Randy going to be OK?
Yeah, he'll be fine. He's just got to spend a little time on his own, take some rest; he'll be ok.
you sure you're going to be ok?
Yeah, I'm just-- I'm glad to be home.
look...
I'm just going to call in sick.
what? Why would you do that?
you know, I'm sick of this split schedule and I just don't think you should be alone right now.
are you--I am-- I am fine, and a lot tougher than you think I am.
right. I know. I just...
look, you are going to work, OK? And I...
I'm cooking.
all right.
I am having a perfect evening.
I just took off an exfoliating mask, and I am watching movies that you normally make me put back at the video store.
Yes, "the sisterhood of the traveling pants" is one of them.
come on. It's sweet.
when are you going to come home?
no. Wake me up. I don't mind.
Aah!
I've been having nightmares, too.
I guess it affected me more than I'd like to admit.
well, I've been on edge all morning.
I tossed and turned all night last night.
I keep obsessing about the ring.
I am just so pissed that I didn't just put it on my finger.
and then I feel guilty because I'm obsessing about an object when all that really matters is that nobody got hurt.
Hey, Charlie gave you that ring.
it's ok to obsess about it.
I know.
it's just that it reminded me of this very innocent time with him.
got a lot of memories attached to it.
I'm sure there are.
uh... hi.
just--just let us know if you need any help.
Mm-hmm.
you know, it says that the robber got away with 35 grand in jewelry and over 75 grand in cash.
Yeah, I know. I heard that on the news last night.
what were they doing with so much cash in their store?
can you believe how fast that guy was? I mean, it was like two minutes.
felt like about two years to me.
you know what? I'm feeling a little skittish.
do you mind if I just get some air?
no. Go ahead.
OK.
you want anything?
you know what? If you go by village java, an herbal tea would be great.
OK.
I can help you.
I just spoke to Mr. Kaehler. It's about Randy.
he's dead.
his wife found him this morning.
they think it was his asthma.
may the lord rest Randy's soul peacefully. Amen.
Randy's sister Sally would like to say a few words.
thank you.
three days ago, my sister-in-law lost her husband, a little girl lost her father...
and I lost my brother.
this town lost a good man.
he was just trying to make a living and do the right thing...
no one else sees me? Just you?
he was just a simple man, who loved people.
he was just a--a gentle soul.
we're going to miss you, Randy.
Oh, Lynn, I just want to tell you how sorry I am.
he was a really good man.
I still can't believe he's gone.
I keep waiting for him to just walk up to me, take the baby, and ask me how my day was.
I wanted to introduce you to my friend Melinda.
we were both in the store when it happened.
your husband acted very bravely. I'm really grateful to him.
thank you for telling me that. It means a lot.
she's so beautiful.
I feel like he's watching over her.
I'm sure he is.
Melinda? - Are you all right?
can I get you some water or something?
I think it's just allergies.
find it!
I still think we should just close the store for the day.
I don't know if I can concentrate with everything that's just happened.
which is exactly why we should work today, just stay focused.
Yeah, but don't you think we need a minute?
I mean, just to, I don't know, let it sink in?
Yeah, but I do that by staying busy.
I do it by sitting on the couch, staring out the window with my mouth open.
well, we all have our own way of dealing with it.
what?
are you all right? - Yeah.
Yeah. I--I just thought I saw something.
I think he was building a cradle when he died.
in the basement? - Exactly.
as a surprise for his family?
keep going.
and he wants you to tell his wife where it's hidden.
see? We could practically go into business together on this.
wait a minute. Aren't we already?
good point.
OK, that wasn't even a challenge. Give me a hard one.
be careful what you wish for there, wise guy.
all right, look, what are you going to do? You're going to go bang on his wife's door and tell her, "there's a surprise in your basement?
no, I'm going to tell her Randy's here.
do you think she's going to believe you?
it's the time when people are most likely to. After a loss, you know, they really want to believe.
it's amazing. - What?
just that you can do this, you know? That you can make the difference.
look at the impact you have on people's lives.
is it worth the impact it has on our lives?
Yeah, even though I don't always think so.
all right. Enough philosophy. Time for food.
hmm.
you bought me roses.
Dr. Phil encourages the occasional romantic gesture.
it's a signal from Randy.
thought it was a signal from me, saying,"I love my crazy wife.
I just wonder what it means.
I think it means randy owes me 50 bucks.
can I help you?
Hi. Is lynn here?
no. She went back to work.
Oh. I'm Melinda. We met at randy's funeral.
Yeah, I remember.
do you know when she'll be back from work?
uh... what is this-- what is this about?
I'm sorry. I just have to talk to her.
I have a message from Randy.
what?
about Randy.
why don't you come in for a minute?
.
just come in. I actually have to change rose.
her name is rose?
Oh, nap time, finally.
Oh.
Oh, sorry the room's such a mess. I was trying to find her favorite teddy, and of course, it was at the bottom of the trunk.
like some coffee?
so, what's the message about Randy?
Oh, it's just something I needed to talk to Lynn about.
Randy was my brother. You can tell me.
I know. It's just personal.
you know, I can come back tonight if that works better.
Lynn works just 5 minutes away. I can call her.
well, where does she work? Because I could go there.
Oh, no, no, no. Just let me call her.
there's a woman here. I don't know.
it's that woman who was sick at the funeral.
she's on her way. - Oh.
uh, you know what? I have to get going.
um, my husband's expecting me.
she'll just be here in a few minutes.
no, I really have to go.
I'm sorry. I'm really going to have to insist.
is that her? - Uh-huh.
get out.
how's it going?
I don't know what's happening, but I need to leave. I'm expected...
take it easy. All right?
it's no big deal. You want to go, you can go.
just tell me what the message is.
it's just something that I wanted to say to lynn.
Ah.
you had a little thing with Randy, did you?
no. I'm married.
Yeah.
well, let me tell you something.
there's a lot of married people who like some candy on the side.
well, I don't, and my husband's going to be wondering where I am, so
don't be stupid, ok, Melinda?
just tell me what randy wanted Lynn to know.
we're having fun now, though, aren't we?
but I'm going to get serious in a minute.
there's a cradle in the basement randy was working on before he died.
he wanted Lynn to know that it was down there. That's it.
that's the message.
good girl.
when did he tell you about the cradle?
not that long ago.
and why? Why'd he tell you?
because I was the only one listening at the time.
Yeah, I'll bet.
well, where is it, huh?
I don't know.
where is it?
why in the hell are you asking me?
um...
huh?
where is the money ?
what money?
this where it is? Huh, Randy?
well, where is it?
where is it?
what the hell are you doing?
all right. Why are you doing this? Just tell me where the money is.
who are you talking to?
huh?
Randy is here, his spirit. That's how I knew about the cradle.
Oh.
OK.
right.
maybe Randy is here.
this is where he died.
hmm?
locked down in the basement, all by himself.
now, when you remember where that money is...
you give me a shout, ok?
excuse me. Can you tell me how much this is?
Oh, there's no price on it?
here. Oh! Heavy. Heh heh!
hang on a second. I'll find out for you.
Wyatt, what are you doing? I already checked in here.
yeah? You got a better idea?
no answer.
are you all right?
no. Are you kidding?
get me out of here.
Yeah, I will, I will. Wyatt's going to leave in a minute.
he wants me to watch you.
where the hell is it? Damn it!
he's crazy, but I'll get you out of here as soon as we hear his car leave.
Wyatt robbed the jewelry store, didn't he?
Yeah.
Where's the baby?
upstairs.
you left her up there with him?
it's ok. He'd never hurt her.
Wyatt said that you act like Randy's here, like you see his ghost or something.
can you? Can--can you see my brother?
he did this to me. He did!
Yeah. I can see him. He's right behind you.
if that kind of thing was true, could he hear me and see me?
because if that kind of thing is true, I want to tell him that I'm sorry.
things got messed up, they weren't supposed to.
OK, look. Sally?
if you leave me down here like this, you're only going to be in the same trouble as wyatt, so why don't you do the right thing, ok?
just do it for Randy.
don't talk to me like I haven't done for Randy.
he was the kind of kid that needed protecting.
he was a sickly kid growing up.
tell her.
he's saying that your husband did this to him.
I know, I know. He did it to both of us.
and now we're in so deep.
he killed me.
what? What is it?
Wyatt killed him.
no, that can't be.
Wyatt knows how much randy means to me-- uh, meant.
OK, he's gone. Let's go. I'll take you out of here.
you know what?
if you know where the money is, then if you told me, then we could split it and I could get away from wyatt. He'd never have to know.
don't you think if I knew where the money was, I would have told him an hour ago?
I don't care about the money.
I just want to go home.
no.
if she knows where the money is, she's not telling.
please!
she's lying.
no, I don't think so.
she's not going to play games. She's scared to death.
yeah? She tell you she sees Randy?
Yeah. She said he was right there with us.
gave me chills.
so what? What, is she nuts?
why would she be here if it wasn't to tell lynn where the money is?
she says that randy told her that you killed him.
so you tell me. Is she nuts?
maybe you're both nuts.
all right, take Rose to the apartment.
I am going to tear this place upside down until I find what I am looking for, and I will find it.
now, go.
why the hell won't you tell me what he wants to know?
I am. I will.
Yeah, right.
is it true?
did you die in this basement? Did he do something to you?
you were in on it. - I had to.
nobody has to do something like that.
I did it for my daughter, for Rose.
what's wrong with Rose?
she was born too soon. It was a miracle she lived.
the day we got her home-- to her house, her room
I never had another day like that.
no insurance, hospital bills, thousands and thousands
still it doesn't mean you should steal.
I was... so desperate.
Wyatt came to me with this plan. He told me I would look innocent.
nothing would happen to me, and I'd have enough money to take care of rose.
there was nothing I wouldn't do to protect her.
what did your wife think about all this?
Lynn doesn't know.
she was so glad I wasn't hurt in the robbery.
what happened after the robbery?
I didn't really think I could trust Wyatt or Sally.
she's my sister, but she'll do anything Wyatt wanted.
I was afraid they'd leave town, double-cross me, so I managed to get my hands on the money and I let Wyatt take the jewels.
he, uh, came here when Lynn was out with Rose.
he locked me down here.
he wouldn't let me come up till I told him where the money was.
just tell me what it is that he wants so he can let me go.
I don't know if he will let you go.
OK, you have to help me get out of here.
you have to help me, too.
how? - The key.
give lynn the key.
you help me...
and then I help you.
I'll get you out of here.
I have an idea.
what is it, honey?
Hey, lady, move it.
go!
now.
Hey!
Randy, what are you doing? Let me out.
I'm really sorry. I just can't let you go.
Randy, open the door.
we have to wait for Lynn. You give her the key, then you go.
what? There is a man with a gun in that basement.
do you want your wife to come home to that?
if I let you go now, you'll go straight to the police.
I can't let that happen until lynn gets the key.
I'm really sorry. Please understand. I just can't take any chances.
look, you and me, we got better things to do than this.
just tell me where the money is, and I'll let you walk away.
Yeah.
I'll be damned.
is that you?
Hey, Delia. You know where Melinda is?
Yeah, I think she went over to Lynn's to bring her some cookies.
Yeah, but she should be back by now.
Yeah, I thought she went home.
you know where Lynn's house is?
um, I think so. We shipped something over to randy a while ago, so let me see.
Thanks.
right here.
I know the street. Call me if she shows up.
maybe--maybe we could have a conversation.
Hey, you think he's some innocent victim in all this?
no, he's playing you, girlfriend, just like he played me.
don't listen to him. He'll say anything.
Hey, I didn't even know there'd be all that cash in the store.
I was just looking for a little jewelry.
well, Randy, he double-crossed me.
what is he talking about?
didn't you, randy?
come on.
I feel... so lightheaded.
why do I feel so tired?
it's because you're using up all your energy.
wait a minute.
you all have a wonderful day now.
he didn't know about the 75 grand, did he?
come on, Mel.
I knew it didn't make any sense.
he didn't have time to go to that safe, and he left with one bag of jewelry.
you took the money, didn't you?
you took it before the robbery even happened, to make sure that it got blamed on the thief.
Where'd you put it?
in my car, but I moved it later.
and you set him up.
Yeah. Ha ha. Poor Wyatt.
he thought I was so stupid, treated me like such an idiot.
do you think I was going to take a chance like that for a few thousand in jewels?
and then they reported the robbery on the news and how much had been stolen.
you should have seen the look on Wyatt's face.
it was--it was priceless.
I still thought I had enough time to get lynn and rose and get away.
that's when he trapped you here?
Yeah.
and you know the rest.
do I?
Whoa!
yes?
Hi. I'm looking for Lynn Cooper.
welcome home.
that's Lynn.
she and randy moved months ago.
did they leave any kind of forwarding address?
no. I think they just needed something a bit larger.
right.
sorry to bother you.
Where's rose?
get inside. - What?
get in here.
what's wrong with you?
get in the kitchen! - Why?
you want rose to be an orphan? Do it!
you remember Lynn.
move it! Get over! You, too! Move!
what the hell is this, Wyatt?
tell him not to hurt her. I'll tell him where the money is.
Randy is asking you not to hurt her. He'll tell you what you want to know.
what is she talking about?
I'm not going to hurt you. I just want to know where my money is.
what money?
the money from the robbery.
your husband and Wyatt were in on it together.
Oh, well, that's crazy because randy would never do that.
Oh, that's the easiest part of the story to believe, trust me.
give her the key.
look, Randy has something for you. He says that you'll know what to do with it.
well, whatever this key opens is where he hid the 75 grand.
it belongs to me.
I don't understand. Why would Randy send this message to you?
it's complicated.
what does this open, huh?
it's to my locker at the gym.
it's to randy's locker at the gym.
what? - What gym? What gym?
um, the main street gym.
what's happening? Why haven't you called me?
don't worry about it! Just meet me at the gym on main street.
Where's Melinda? Where's Lynn?
they're both here with me.
what are you going to do?
just get to the gym!
you park in the lot and you wait for me.
and when Lynn gives me what I want, you give the baby to her.
Oh, god.
all right, right here. This is it. Pull in right here.
all right. Now, we are just going to walk inside and go to the locker.
just a few more minutes and this will all be over, girls.
all right, good. Get out. Get out.
let's go. Move it.
which one?
tell him it's locker 39.
open it.
it doesn't work.
what are you doing? - What?
it doesn't fit!
give me that. Move.
son of a bitch!
you got to be kidding.
what the hell are you doing?
Where's my money?
Freeze! Don't move! Hands up! Let me see them now!
how did you know to call the police?
well, honey, I didn't. They called me.
Lynn, I-- I'm sorry.
OK.
for the record, this is Wyatt Hawkins?
Yes, that's him.
he was my brother, Wyatt, and you killed him.
would you tell him that I'm sorry?
tell him--tell him that I should have watched over him better.
uh, ok, come on.
Randy: Tell her it's ok. Tell her I'm fine.
he said it's ok. It's fine now.
I'm really sorry I let this happen.
will you watch out for me?
Hey, Melinda.
Hi. Good morning.
morning.
please tell me you don't need another statement.
Oh, no, no. We've got plenty of those.
we just sent wyatt for a psych evaluation.
Really? Hmm. He didn't seem like he was nut-house crazy.
heh! Well, he said you'd been speaking with Randy Cooper's ghost.
does sound kind of nutty, doesn't it?
Yeah, well, he's probably just angling for an insanity defense.
right.
listen.
we were able to find all the jewelry in Wyatt's house, and I got the ok to give Delia her ring back...
Oh.
but I thought you might like to.
I'd love to.
you don't know what this means to me.
I never thought I'd see it again.
thank you so much.
Mmm.
I can't believe everything you have just been through.
you know what? I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.
it seems to happen to you a lot.
in fact, I was meaning to ask you, you know, the day I found out that randy had died, I saw you in the square and I was about to tell you, but... you told me first.
how did you know that?
she doesn't know?
Wow. How did you pull that off?
I, um, I could just see it on your face.
but how?
how did you make the leap that he had died?
I really don't know how to explain it. I just...have very good instincts about these things.
OK.
you skated on that one.
it's my turn to buy you coffee, right? - No way.
no, no, no, no, no.
coffee is on me, so I'll be right back.
you put my life in danger and your wife's.
it--it was a calculated risk.
you used me.
look, all I wanted was for Lynn to be taken care of.
Yeah, but nothing came from any of it, Randy.
you're dead, and your sister and your brother-in-law are going to prison, and no one but you knows where the money is, so what do you want your wife to do now?
I--I tried everything I could.
and now it's time to move on.
do you see the light?
Yep.
wait--wait a minute. Where are you going?
you know, I can't help wondering what's going to happen to a guy like me on the other side of that light.
you can't stay here. You're meant to cross over.
Yeah.
let's just say I got a better offer.
Randy, don't do it.
I know what you're talking about, who you're talking about. Don't go to him.
I've already made my deal, and they want me to give you a message.
what message?
the dead will walk.
what does that mean?
you think you know so much. You don't know anything.
they've shown me things, so much that's about to happen.
there's no way I'm going to miss it.
I didn't--I didn't know you were there.
were you just talking to yourself?
Randy. You know, I was just thinking about the money from the robbery and how frustrated I am that they didn't find it.
Oh. Well, here.
didn't you say that Lynn got a key from Randy? Maybe she knows something.
front door is open. Car's not here.
Hello? Hey, Lynn?
are you here?
well, she cleared out everything.
Lynn? Are you up here?
she sure got out of here in a hurry.
you think she knew where the money was?
I don't know, but even if she did, the police have the key, so unless she has a duplicate, there's no way of her really getting to it.
Wow. She left a lot of great stuff behind.
would it be immoral or illegal of us to sell it?
probably.
what?
look at this.
whoa.
that money was here the whole time.
I thought the police had the key.
no, it doesn't matter;
it was never locked. Randy knew that she would recognize the design on the key.
that's the only signal she needed. The money was right here.
which is why she was so confused when he said that the key was for a locker.
do you think Lynn has the money?
my name is Melinda Gordon.
I'm married, I live in a small town, and I own an antique shop.
I might be just like you.
except that from the time I was a little girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.
it's all right, honey.
earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.
they're stuck here, because they have unfinished business with the living, and they come to me for help.
in order to tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.
this bracelet is so cute.
Hey, did you find anything?
check out this technicolor ceramic chicken.
you can check inside, folks, too. Lots for sale.
just out of curiosity, why the sale?
some kind of lien, unpaid bills, taxes.
it's been in the courts for months.
woman ran out on her kid, left everyone holding the bag.
did you feel that? - What?
I don't know. Felt like a cold spot or something.
probably getting sick or something.
that's what happens when I don't get enough sleep.
so why aren't you sleeping?
well, somebody's been keeping me up at night.
Oh, really.
please. He has 4 legs and fur.
I thought that Bob the dog was always quiet.
Yeah, was, but now he just starts barking for no reason in the middle of the night.
he's just growling at nothing. It's just the weirdest thing.
this is gorgeous.
turn of the century, you know, before there was plastic, they used to make the snow out of ground rice.
Wow. The things you know.
Hey, they have modernist lamps in the other room, so I'm gonna go check it out.
I'll see you back here.
get out.
leave.
I'm sorry. Is this your room?
I knew I'd find you here.
do you know how out of their minds worried the garnets are?
Yeah, but this is my stuff.
that's my mother's snow globe.
Yeah, this room isn't for sale.
I'm so sorry.
the--the door was open, so... - come on, Julie.
No! This is my house!
but it isn't anymore.
come on, Julie.
uh, both of these.
thank you.
I think this is yours.
go ahead. Take it.
I don't want it.
I ruin everything I touch.
God, let me get this thing off you.
all right, there.
what are you looking for?
I don't know yet.
Mr. Wheeler. Hi. I'm Melinda Gordon.
OK.
uh, I called you about Julie.
I was at the estate sale yesterday at the house, remember?
I thought I asked you to call back next week for an appointment.
Oh, well, I--I thought you said to come by today and you'd be delighted to talk about julie.
ms. Gordon, I can't give out any information about kids in the state's care.
are you applying to be a foster parent?
no, but in my profession, I deal with troubled people every day, and I recognized some of julie's issues, - so if I could just talk to her... - are you a licensed therapist?
no.
psychiatrist?
no, but-- - pediatrician?
no. Do you have a card?
Aha.
Yes.
when Julie needs a faberge egg, we'll give you a call.
thanks for your concern.
Bob! What?
is that psycho Bob? - Yes.
you know, I just didn't wanna leave him home again, in case that's what was driving him crazy.
I know I should've asked. I'm sorry.
no. What better place for a mad dog than the...
antique shop?
see that?
it's like he's being chased by some demon or something.
Bob, sit! Something like that.
OK, you know what?
we are gonna go to the vet.
it's probably just his collar's too tight or something like that.
Hey, you know what? If I give you a name, could you track down an address?
Yeah, sure. I still have all my real estate contacts.
what's the name? Garnet.
sure. Come on, babe.
Homer, do you see a light?
OK, then, go.
not that way.
we took Julie a few months ago.
we love being foster parents.
Mike and I have fostered 7 kids in the past 10 years.
but we never had as much trouble as we did with Julie.
Oh, damn it.
I told him to call master handyman.
she did this, you know, Julie.
she broke the door?
Heh. What didn't she break?
you know, we were her third foster home in 2 months.
so after she ran away from us, they sent her back to the youth home, we think.
I kind of feel like we failed.
no, she never trusted us, and she was just so disruptive, always seemed so sad.
kid's been through hell.
what kind of hell?
I'm sorry.
what is your interest in this again?
Oh, I-- I had the opportunity to meet her, and , um...
I was really affected by her, and I just wanted to see if I could help somehow.
well, it's a pretty terrible story.
she and her mother were-- were very nomadic, moving around all the time, you know, and she didn't really have a father.
I think he died before she was born.
anyway, they came to grandview about 6 months ago, and one day, julie's mother told her that she would pick her up at the bus stop, and she waited, and she waited...
and her mother never showed up.
so where did she go?
nobody knows. She's--she's still missing.
Julie's caseworker told us that she was wanted for some petty crimes, bouncing checks, stuff like that.
I think she was just running away from her responsibilities, her troubles.
did you ever see anything out of the ordinary happening in the house?
what do you mean?
unusual things. Unexplainable things.
uh, no, not really.
so how do you know she's haunted?
bracelets, posters, the look on the garnets' face when I asked if anything unexplained had ever happened.
you know, just because the ghost hasn't shown itself, that doesn't mean that it's not there.
you think she knows?
I doubt it.
she probably just thinks she's a freak and that no one wants her.
the feelings you have a passing acquaintance with.
at least my mom was there.
she may not have understood me, but I wasn't alone in the world like her, you know?
I just--I really feel for her.
for all I know, her mother could've died.
maybe that's who's haunting her.
or maybe it's her father.
either way, I have to find some peace for her and this ghost.
Oh, hey, there she is.
come on. I want you to meet Julie.
come... hey, Julie!
don-- wait!
come on.
Julie, you don't have to run away from me.
I just wanna talk.
you should be running from me.
why would you say that?
look, I know what you're going through.
you don't know anything about me.
I know that you're scared.
and I know that you're confused...
and I know that you miss your mom and you hate her all at the same time.
and I know that you're not as different as you think.
hurry.
you need to go now.
look, I know what it's like to lose a parent.
no, she's coming back. I know she is.
please, please go away!
what's gonna happen to her?
she's gonna be transferred to a state facility for troubled teens.
we're just waitin' for a bed to open up.
well, thanks again.
who's gonna understand her in a place like that?
look, maybe we can find out where she's going, get special visiting privileges.
no. We have to help her.
we have to help her, jim, right now.
how?
bring her to the one place in grandview where someone will understand her.
you're talking about becoming foster parents.
Mel, that's a huge commitment.
look, I'm not talking about anything permanent, ok?
but I have to do whatever it takes to get into that little girl's life and help her.
I know. I know. I know how much you wanna help her.
I know how much you feel for her, and I love you for that.
I don't even know how you could add a but at the end of that, but I can feel it coming.
you see yourself in this girl, but you have to ask yourself who are you trying to help here, yourself or her?
you can't fix 2 broken hearts by trying to stitch them together.
that is the sappiest thing I have ever heard.
Yeah, I don't know where I got that one.
look, it's not just me that she needs.
it's you, too.
we just have to do it long enough to get whatever's haunting her to leave.
Jim, it's the only way.
that was the social worker.
we are finally approved.
that's fantastic.
Oh, Melinda, I'm so happy for you.
I almost can't even believe it, between the office interviews, the in-home studies, the background checks, it's easier to become a spy.
OK, what else don't I know about you?
and it really helps that jim is an E. M.T.
you know, with the medical training, county employee.
if it weren't for him, it would take at least 2 months.
so when is she coming? - Today!
I have to go get the guest room ready and grocery shop.
lots of frosted cereals.
this is gonna be great for you and for jim.
well, it's just temporary, until they can find a more permanent family.
Hey, speaking of families, where's Bob?
you know, I brought him to the vet.
yesterday I fed him, and he just stood back from the bowl and started growling at the food.
it was so strange.
I just wanna make sure nothing neurological's going on.
anyway, I'm bringin' in the big guns.
a saw a sign up at the bookstore that this superstar dog behaviorist is doing a book signing today, and you can bring your dog in to get a, I don't know, therapy session, I guess.
great.
so we'll have a double date.
you bring the dogs, and, uh, I'll meet you there.
dogs?
OK, ladies, you're next to see Cesar Millan.
Hi. This is Bob.
Hi.
Bob Down.
does he always act this way?
well, no. He used to be the calmest dog around.
has anything changing in his life lately, like meeting a dog or friend, a,you know, person?
you know, I'm dating somebody new, but Bob seems to really love him.
he gets very excited every time he's around-- Sit!
well, he's exhibiting something more territorial-like, like there's another dog around us here, but there's no dog in here.
sorry.
that guy has some issues.
can I ask you, um, a question about my dog... since you are the dog whisperer?
sure. Is he here?
uh, in a manner of speaking.
I need for him to go somewhere.
let's just call it a room. - Ok.
it's not a living room, but...
anyway, he doesn't wanna do it.
all right.
well, what you need to do is you need to embrace a pack leader mentality, become calm and assertive, and then he'll go. He will follow you.
OK, no problem.
I don't really wanna go into that particular room.
not yet, anyway.
well, it's actually very simple.
obviously your dog is feeding on your energy.
he's not hearing what you're saying.
so until you change your feelings about the room, then he will go into that room.
thank you. You're welcome.
sit.
see what I mean?
OK, homer, now I am the boss of you. All right?
I'm the pack leader, so I don't know.
go.
go.
are you ready?
want the truth?
look, if we can handle one supernatural teenager, we can handle any child.
wait. Are you saying that your biological clock is- - oh, no. Focus.
Hey, Julie. Welcome.
come on in.
Hi. Steve Wheeler. Jim clancy. Let me-- give me that.
I really appreciate you all doing this.
Oh, she has a-- a retainer that she-- she wears at night.
she takes it out to eat, but otherwise, it stays in.
OK. Hey, are you hungry?
you know what? We've got some snacks, and for dinner, Jim is an awesome cook. He makes the best grilled cheese.
or we could have burgers. Do you-- do you like burgers?
you know what? Let me get you something to drink.
that's fine.
well, I'll check back with you in a couple days.
any questions?
uh, about 600, but I can't think of any right now.
come on. You want me to show you around?
uh, do you have a piano?
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
do you play?
Oh, this is the dining room, where we dine.
Yeah, I was taking lessons from a teacher on Kisbey street.
she was teaching me how to play Ben Kweller songs.
well, that's a cool piano teacher.
I love Ben Kweller. I started listening to him when he was with radish.
when's your birthday?
a valentine baby. That's really cool.
you know, as a belated birthday present, I'd really like you to start your lessons back.
OK? And meanwhile, um...
I hope that you can accept this as a down payment on your birthday present.
thank you.
I'm kind of tired.
do I have a place to sleep?
Yes. Of course.
Jim, could you take her upstairs?
Yeah.
I'll show you.
nice to meet you. - Thank you.
it'll take a while, but you'll do fine.
really.
um, before I leave, can I have a moment?
it's probably nothing, but, um,
I just wanted to let you know that the police got a hit on valerie parker's bank account.
it's Julie's mother.
uh, it's some bank activity.
uh... Uh, payments made.
um... we think she may be back in town.
she may try to find Julie.
just call me if she shows.
OK, then. I think I'll say good-bye.
Oh, and, um... good luck.
although, I-- I don't think you'll need it.
thank you.
good night.
sorry that the room looks so uncool.
we never redid it after we moved in, so...
there's some water in case you get thirsty.
Thanks.
Wow.
you have a big collection.
Las vegas, philadelphia, st. Louis, grandview.
have you--have you been to all those cities?
it's all the places me and my mom lived.
which one were you born in?
Ah. Must be something special about grandview to come back.
Oh.
well, that probably needs a new light bulb.
I'll, uh--I'll do it in the morning.
this isn't gonna work, you know.
why not?
you're gonna get hurt.
I want you to know something.
I know that what's happening is not your fault.
I'm not gonna give up on you.
it's all right.
please... please make it stop.
you have a haunted kid who tries to maim you not once, but 3 times, and you're going to invite said haunted kid into your house.
it seemed like the thing to do.
look, I think that this ghost might be the father, because the mother's still alive but I haven't seen him yet, not once.
have a seat.
no ghost, huh?
is this girl going through puberty?
eww. I didn't ask.
well, if you have these things and a girl going through puberty,
I would say what you have on your hand is a classic poltergeist.
I just told you I haven't seen a ghost.
precisely. There is no ghost in a poltergeist but it's--it's confusing, because the german word for poltergeist translates to "noisy ghost."
but the germans and their words, they've always been a little strange.
Butterfly-- schmetterling.
Pencil-- kugerschreibger- - on the subject, please.
right. Sorry.
Uh,"noisy ghost" is a bit of a misnomer. Ok?
a poltergeist is a supernatural event caused by human agents.
like being able to move things with your mind?
Yes, and 9 times out of 10, that human agent is a girl in the throes of puberty and/or going through horrible trauma.
well, her mom walked out on her. I can't imagine anything more traumatic.
OK, so how do I help her?
well, you have to get rid of the stress.
then the poltergeist events will stop. Get her to talk about her mother.
get her to open up, talk about her feelings.
Oh, that sounds too easy.
it is. It is too easy.
it's too easy, Melinda. Don't try that.
let me complicate things.
let me make it harder by running tests.
I'll get a kirlian camera.
what? No cameras. No you.
that's not fair, Melinda.
you--you see ghosts when you open your freezer dancing in the ice cube trays.
I--I need physical evidence.
learn to deal, ok, but you know what?
this is gonna get worse and worse.
it's like a tub filling up with water, and that water's gonna keep rising to the top until someone let's some of the water out the drain.
you're gonna have a flood on your hands.
this thing you're doing for this girl...
it's--it's pretty great.
professor payne, are you getting soft on me?
are you kidding me?
I am schmetterling.
hear me roar.
OK. I think it's your turn.
your mom's really pretty.
um, why did you guys come back to grandview?
she wanted me to see my roots.
must have been rough moving around so much.
after a while, you just kinda get used to it.
you know, when I was a little bit younger than you, um, my dad would leave us, sometimes for months.
"business," my mom would say.
and then one day, he just never came back.
and I would ask her why, you know.
Oh, it's "business," she'd say.
he'll be back.
every time, no matter how much I asked, she always had an answer, anything to keep me hoping.
I think I always knew, you know, deep down.
anyway,
I think that you know things, too, julie, deep down.
I mean, I--I always knew that she wasavoiding something or running from someone, but she never told me who.
who do you think it was?
I really don't know, but we changed names every time we moved.
do you remember what the names were?
mom usually picked the name of the street we last lived on, just to make it easier for us to remember.
there was greentree, fallon, ovington, and...
Melinda... help me find her.
nothing you did made her leave.
it's not you.
Yay.
great. Ok, curved fingers, right.
OK, don't forget.
I am so happy to see you.
come here.
it's good to see you, too.
OK, well, come on. Warm up.
OK, we'll pick up right where left off.
got a bunch of great new sheet music-- badly drawn boy, rufus wainwright, keane.
I try to stay current.
I find they stay with me longer that way, and then as a bonus, my kids are actually less embarrassed of me.
well, thanks for fitting us in.
so you're Julie's foster mom?
I mean, can I ask what happened to Valerie?
no one knows.
have you seen her?
no.
I--I was just surprised, because she was such a doting mother.
has she ever spoken to you about her father?
Julie's a remarkable girl.
she needs a good mother.
she deserves it.
all right, Valerie Parker.
she's got a few warrants for unpaid parking tickets, bouncing checks, but nothing major and nothing older than 6 months.
and nothing from the other cities she lived?
Nope. No school records. No medical.
it's like she was born 6 months ago.
but I did get a few hits on a valerie of a different name.
on ovington ave. In '94.
that's her.
well, yes, I remember her.
she lived here about 13 years ago.
that's right.
had a daughter.
are you going to ask me a question, or are you just gonna keep telling me what I know?
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to get some information on her.
um, I'm the foster mother of her daughter.
the hell you are.
excuse me?
I was very close to Valerie.
I saw her through that whole ordeal.
what ordeal?
when the baby died.
are you sure that you're not confusing her with another tenant?
I remember that last day I saw her. It was valentine's day, and, I had talked her into spending the day with me, because neither of us had a valentine, but she never showed up.
her daughter didn't die.
I was just with her this morning.
I was there when val buried her.
I was even there when she had the operation the next month.
what operation?
the hysterectomy.
She--because of complications with the delivery.
Ah, that's what really wrecked her.
she lost her child, she lost her husband, and she could never have another kid.
you know, she put her name on every kind of adoption list.
and did she adopt?
if she did, it was after she left here.
you said Valerie left town on Julie's birthday?
right, which may mean that Julie was born that day in another town and Valerie went to adopt her.
but why changes names in every town?
I don't know.
I have to talk to Julie again. I mean, she has to know more than she realizes.
come on.
hey... you ok?
have you ever seen an aura?
OK, Melinda, tell me about your first time.
on kirlian camera, Jim.
I would never ask her that... with you home.
OK, come take a look at this.
it's really just gas ionization of moisture molecules around a living organism, but it's still pretty cool, huh?
so the cloud that I saw, that was an aura?
no. Uh, auras are sweet and pretty.
what you saw was not. What you saw was an ectoplasm.
it's a form of bioenergy. Jim, that's not a shopping cart.
so, right, it's a byproduct of psychic phenomena, sort of like the snot of a psychic cold virus.
nice.
whatever it is, it's probably telling us that this is escalating to very dangerous levels.
so why did it disappear the minute that we walked in?
that's an excellent question, Melinda Gordon, really.
well? Hmm?
no, I'm--I don't have an answer. That's why it's an excellent question.
what is all this stuff?
Oh, Jim, you're so naive. It's adorable.
it's the candy store for the parapsychologist.
cameras, microphones to record paranormal activity.
you have the electromagnotometer to record electromagnetic energy, and of course there's the old, reliable neurofeedback machine to monitor synaptic activity.
and there's the mp3 player so I can listen to motley crue.
just 'cause I'm a professor doesn't mean I don't like to rock out.
how is all this gonna help?
we can monitor the girl's, uh, brain activity with this machine, and then we can see the hot spots in her head when she has a poltergeist event going on. Then we treat her.
look, I didn't even tell Julie about this, so what if she says no?
if this guy can figure out what's wrong with me...
I'm ready.
you said it happens when she gets emotional, so why don't you just sit in the seat and you can have the honors?
don't you think she's been through enough?
it's the only way I can map out activity in her brain if we have a poltergeist, so let's--let's have a poltergeist.
OK, Julie, um, when did these things start happening to you?
about 2 months ago.
it started in my first foster home.
and is there a certain time that they happen, like a--a situation?
it happens to anyone that starts to care about me.
OK, let'S...you know?
do you know where you were really born?
what? What are you talking about? I was born in grandview.
there is no record of that.
n-no. Why--why would my mom lie to me about that?
she's been lying about a lot of things.
no. My mother gave me everything I ever needed.
I don't care about anything else.
Melinda, what-- what's going on?
Oh, my god. I see it.
finally. - well
do you see it?
see what?
doesn't want me to see it.
look, who are you? What do you want?
what's happening?
take her back.
take her back? What does that mean?
what's going on? Who are you talking to?
I came to take her back.
what?
wh-why are you talking about my mom?
what is going on?
she can't know.
OK, I can't do this. I need to know!
what's going on?
I need to know what's going on!
it's all right.
how's she doing in there?
she won't let me in her room.
Jim's still trying.
OK, look, I might've been slightly wrong. It looks like we have a ghost.
slightly wrong as in slightly dead or slightly pregnant?
I thought you told me that her mother was alive.
well, that's what wheeler said, that she was cashing checks.
maybe the payments on that account are automated. They don't stop unless you stop them.
take her back, what does that mean?
I don't know. Take her back into the afterlife? Does she wanna kill her?
no, that can't be it.
she wasn't hurting her, you know.
she was just trying to keep us from getting to her. In fact, she never hurt her.
maybe she doesn't want julie to have a new family.
Why? - I don't know.
she's a mom, can't let go.
that's creepy.
take her back.
take her back where?
home?
there's nothing there for her.
there's no family. There's...
it all makes sense.
the changing of names, constant running, no records.
february 14 isn't julie's birthday.
it's the day she was kidnapped.
but why bring Julie back to the town where she was stolen?
to take her back to her real mother.
she's here.
I loved her like she was my own.
you have to believe me.
you stole someone else's child.
she's not gonna talk to me while you guys are there.
OK.
it was wrong, but I just couldn't undo it.
I loved her too much.
why did you bring her back here?
sick.
I was real sick.
I had a blood clot in my brain.
I know I deserved it.
I had to give her back before I died.
but you died first.
it wasn't supposed to happen so soon.
an aneurism.
and I just slipped into the lake.
my body's still there.
Valerie, you have to tell her the truth.
no. I can't.
she can't know.
she doesn't know where you are, and she still has hope that you're alive.
no, I won't.
if you don't, then I will.
No!
it's time for the truth.
so she didn't just leave me?
she didn't just get tired of me?
no.
no, leaving you is the last thing she wanted to do.
your mother was just trying to do something good for you.
that's why she brought you back here.
she just died before she could do it.
how do you know all of this?
Julie, your mom died, but...
she stayed with you.
her spirit, she's been protecting you.
she's the reason all these weird things have been happening.
what?
my mother has been doing all this to me?
no, please!
I don't want her to hate me.
let me tell her the rest.
Julie, your mom is here with us, and there's some things that she wants you to know.
she's gonna tell me, and then I'll tell you, ok?
she's gonna think I'm a monster.
you have to tell her the truth.
I just wanted a child so badly.
I had so much love to give.
my baby died, and I could never have another one.
and all I could think of was, why her?
why does she get to have 3 healthy children, and I get none?
I was a good person.
I didn't do anything wrong, and all that I cared for in this world got taken from me.
I just wanted someone to love and to take care of.
she took me?
she's not my real mother?
I don't deserve forgiveness, but, honey, you deserve a mother.
how could you do that?
she is so sorry.
Julie, she knows that she was wrong.
and do you know who my real mother is?
who is she?
come here.
Hi. Uh, I was here with julie a few days ago.
of course. Hi.
what can I do for you?
I know that you lost your daughter 13 years ago.
she was--she was taken from you. Is that right?
Yes.
why are you asking?
your daughter's been found.
what?
I mean, are you sure?
I mean,'cause the-- the police gave up.
everyone gave up.
everyone but me, of course.
well, you can stop looking now.
do you think she'll ever be able to forgive me?
that's for her to decide.
that light, that can't be for me.
it is.
you're ready to go.
no, I'm ashamed to go. I don't deserve that light.
look, I don't know what's over there, but I don't think it's judgment.
what?
that's my baby girl.
the state released julie into heather's custody.
she has a brother and sister to get to know.
what?
I don't know. It's just, uh...
I think I'll miss her a little bit.
be weird to see that room empty.
well, maybe the room won't be empty forever.
Hey, and you know what?
we've always got homer, even though he won't come inside.
man's dead best friend.
know what? Maybe he's just here to watch over us, a watchdog.
Yeah. If I was a burglar, I think I would avoid the house with the invisible dog that can't bite me.
you know what?
do you know if we have any of those meringue cookies left?
are you planning a midnight refrigerator raid?
my name is Melinda Gordon.
I'm married, I live in a small town, and I own an antique shop.
I might be just like you.
except that from the time I was a little girl,
I knew that I could talk to the dead.
it's all right, honey.
earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.
they're stuck here, because they have unfinished business with the living, and they come to me for help.
in order to tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.
come on. Come on.
we can win this. Now.
downcourt. Bring it.
come on. Come on.
shoot!
shoot, you idiot!
get it! Get it! Get it!
what?
son of A.
un-friggin'-believable.
someone down here?
did you get a look at his face?
dude, I almost peed myself.
what a geek.
he actually thought I was a ghost.
I'm bad.
teach him to chew us out for a little game of handball.
better grab that firecracker.
cool. All right. Let's go.
What'd you do?
nothin'. I didn't touch it.
who's doing that?
I don't know. Let's get out of here!
Oh, what about tim? Is he history?
no.
in fact, we finally went on our first real date.
it was really nice.
but I gotta tell you, he burned me once, so a girl's gotta cover her bases.
that's so weird. I just had the other shoe in my hand.
here it is.
so who's the guy tonight?
he's a loan broker, boring, I know, but he's so nice.
he used to ask me out when I worked at the real estate office, and you know, when I finally decided that I was ready to date,
I called him, and you know.
Oh, great.
these are brand-new. I can't believe it.
well, just for the record, I agree that tim deserves a little payback.
fright night. I forgot.
correction. Retro fright night.
psycho, hell house, I know what you did last summer.
wait. How is that Retro? Which one?
cool. So I'm gonna go chill a minute.
have a good time. Hey,
I don't want you staying up too late.
and, Ned, be sure to listen to Melinda tonight.
Ned, we gotta get started.
who are you?
what do you want?
stop it!
it's come back for me.
what do you mean it's come back for you? Who?
I don't know. I...
my buddy Grant and I, just for kicks, you know, we rig things to explode and stuff to scare people, mostly our old grumpy super.
OK, so he's after you?
no.
today, there was something with us down there, something weird.
scared the crap out of me and grant.
it was a ghost, right?
did you get a look at it?
I don't think it wanted me to, but it did want me to find these.
wait.
so this ghost is mad, right?
does anybody ever go like this?
because in claw 2 when that guy got that.
Ned, I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you.
but that thing's dogging me.
Yeah, and you're gonna have to help me figure out why, ok, so we can get it to leave.
Yeah. Ok.
you gonna tell my mom about those?
no, but it's gonna be a very different fright night than we had planned.
so, after we agreed on a rate, I said, "if you can't bring me comps, you're not gettin' your cap back.
really. Seriously, I said that.
I--I was willing to blow a million-dollar deal for a phillies cap.
very bold move.
you have a little something right here.
I--I do?
Oh, that is.
not embarrassing at all.
Hey, happens to me all the time.
I doubt that, but thank you.
how am I?
you're good. You're very, very good.
thank you.
now, I would like to propose a toast.
to you, to thank you for finally saying yes.
Oh, my god.
are you all right?
I just-- I just got a little singed.
that was so strange.
are--are you ok? I'm sorry I spilled.
no, I'm fine.
don't worry about it.
come on, Flancy.
man, don't be a buzzkill.
when was the last time we went out after work?
last thursday.
Hey, is that-- that's Delia.
is she on a date?
Aw, please don't tell me that's a date.
it is. Man,
I thought we were good.
I apologized. I went to great lengths.
that coffee stunt was sweet, Flaher.
right.
she loved it. I took her out to dinner.
we had a great time, so why is she.
you knew.
and you didn't tell me?
is it my job to tell you?
she can go out on a date.
you hurt her feelings, Flaherty.
Oh, what are you, part girl now?
is that it? Ok.
OK. Fine. All right.
game on. Here's the deal.
I need an edge. All right?
you gotta ask Melinda what kind of stuff Delia likes.
you don't need to jump through hoops for Delia.
she likes you.
Oh? Oh, yeah? Then why is she out with pretty boy?
I nearly had a stroke when you called, but I get that you needed time.
Yeah, lots of it, I guess.
waiting till you're ready is a good thing.
uh, how long we gotta be down here?
Hey, that powder, do you know what that is?
Yeah. It's laundry soap.
we set firecrackers to explode the boxes.
and that's when the room started shaking, right?
so he's after your fireworks.
all right, here's the deal.
you have to apologize, and once maybe you make things right, hopefully I can get the spirit to move on.
OK. So I'm sorry.
I...
OK, that didn't happen before.
waste!
all right.
OK, stop it. He said he was sorry.
what's going on?
I--I don't know.
did I say something wrong?
OK, let's get-- let's get out of here.
go.
OK, don't go into the basement until I can figure this out.
now, he said,"stay away,
so hopefully if you're not bugging him, he'll back off.
what's up with "hopefully"?
not to doubt you or anything, but that ghost seemed pretty hardcore.
whenever they seem angry or evil, it just mostly means that they're confused.
so it's clueless?
Oh, that makes me feel a whole lot better.
all right, listen. This is not my first barbecue, ok?
I will take care of it.
take a deep breath.
let's go get something to eat.
are you ok?
my toe.
I stubbed my toe.
was that the ghost?
this one's just as scary.
you know, as far as fright nights go, this one rocks.
Yeah. Let's hope your mom's having as much fun.
any luck down there?
this is-- this is unbelievable.
you know, this is a brand-new car, ok?
these tires never blow out.
I am so sorry.
you know, normally, actually, I can change a tire. Really.
I guess I just call a tow truck, right?
it' s not good for that second date, huh?
dare I even ask?
Oh, you know, I just don't remember dating being this challenging when I was younger.
I wouldn't even know where to start.
frankly, I haven't had a date go well yet.
that's all right.
you know why?
cause I'm-- I'm gettin' out there.
you know, charlie and I, we never even dated.
how did you manage that?
I was friends with his business partner, so we just started hangin' out.
anyway, how was your night?
did you get the crap scared out of you?
sure did. Scary, scary.
anyway, Jim is, uh, on his way home, so I'm gonna.
tim did see you guys at Lento's, by the way.
was he upset about it?
well, Jim called and said that he had to let him win at pool all night just to sort of ease the pain.
is it awful of me that-- that makes my night?
no. I'd be worried about you if it didn't.
but I think you care more about tim than you'd like to admit, because I found these.
in one of your magazines.
Yes, I like him.
we have a good time together.
I'm just not ready to narrow the playing field quite yet.
you know, poor Delia.
it's hard enough to date as a single mom, and then your son brings home a ghost.
I just hope he doesn't do any more damage.
well, if it's any consolation, tim is more determined than ever, and he wants me to scope out what Delia likes so that he can impress her.
well, that's cute, but isn't part of the fun of dating figuring it out?
all right, was it fun when I asked you to close your eyes for a bite of ho ho and you broke out in hives?
look, if you'd known I was allergic, you wouldn't have gotten to play doctor.
good point.
I'll tell him no.
you're not really worried about this ghost, are you?
Ah, it's just-- I don't know.
he's kinda creepy and in their apartment.
are you gonna be able to talk to him?
doesn't seem like he's in a talking mood.
so now I just have to go and talk to the super.
please don't do that.
my pants. I need my pants.
Yeah, and I would really love to help you, but now is not a good time.
do we have a visitor?
it's gone.
thank god.
you should have seen the look on your face.
that must have been one freaky ghost.
you have no idea.
you know, Flaher, I never knew you were into bikes.
it's a funny thing.
I didn't, either, but I just woke up with a picture of this bike in my head like I'd been dreamin' about it.
this isn't just a bike.
this is a full-blown.
midlife crisis.
you hear that?
sounds like one dead battery comin' up.
that guy's gonna be bummed.
all right, you keep workin', and I will, too.
thank you. I appreciate it.
I can't believe he even talked to you.
must be because you're a babe.
Oh, that, and I slipped him a 20, but you know what?
it worked. Look. We got to scratch 3 names off the list.
but this guy roy smead, he died 4 years ago, and he was known to have been a bit of a recluse.
Yeah. I remember something about him.
you knew him?
Nah. That was before we moved in, but grant said he had all these newspapers piled up in his apartment.
they could hardly find the body in the mess.
well, ok, so if he was a loner, he'd be mad at you for disturbing him.
but I'm not anymore.
no, but it gives me time to get some information on the family and find out if this ghost is attached to something in the basement.
hey What's up?
what's up?I was trying to surprise delia with some flowers, but having no idea what kind she liked, I didn't.
I hope if you can ask Melinda.
I asked her.
you did? What'd she say?
Where's the sport in that?
or something to that effect.
Oh, yeah. I forgot. She hates me.
she doesn't hate you.
no, she has to.
I burned her girlfriend.
it's like a rule or something.
Aw, please. You have got
Hey, Clancy, your radio's busted.
just needed a more manly touch.
I wish you could put some clothes on.
well, it's a really beautiful frame.
you have great taste.
Yeah, when you're picking it out.
Oh my god what's wrong?
are you ok?
can I get you some water? sth?
is that your heart? Are you all right?
stay away.
I think I would have seen him around delia by now, but sometimes when people die of violent deaths, the longer they stay away, the more confused they get.
maybe that explains why he's been acting so out of character.
it's like he's protective of ned and delia, but in his state, that can be dangerous.
now, at the risk of certain death, can I suggest that maybe this is something you should tell delia about?
I can handle it.
I have to at least try.
OK.
fair enough.
besides, I need charlie to be a little more stable before I bring ned in, you know?
Delia told me that charlie had a business partner.
maybe that's who I need to talk to.
I just can't go through delia to do it.
Oh, thank you.
Charwae was a real force of nature, fun, warm, always lphelpin' people out.
worked night and day
he designs it himshif.
whatever happeapd to the plane?
lost in the fire.
never quite knew what to do with these.
afraid they might bring up painful memories for Delia, but might mean somethin' to his son, though.
that sounds great.
can you drop it by the store, or do you need me to pick it up?
OK. Terrific.
um, thanks. Thanks a lot.
so what do you think?
it's pretty sweet, huh?
is this yours?
Yeah.
just had this impulse.
bought it just like that.
crazy, huh?
why are you lookin' at me like that?
Charlie had the exact same bike.
no, he- - yeah.
1957 bmw r69, just like this one.
you must have seen a picture of it when you picked me up the other night.
I would never buy the exact same bike charlie had. That'd be weird.
sure would.
why are you still here?
I told you. I need my pants.
I promise you won't need your pants in the light, and if you do, that they'll be there, so why don't you just do us both a favor and go?
Ah, don't get testy with me, girlfriend.
I'm doin' all I can to hold it together here.
you see, that dream where you're naked and you can't wake up, welcome to my life.
afterlife. Whatever.
I don't know. I don't know. Maybe you're right.
maybe I do have your pants and that's why you're stalking me.
Hey, I'm not stalking you.
OK, look, we got a shipment of vintage in last week.
I haven't looked at it yet.
can we just get this over with? I have dinner waiting.
wait. My pants are in there?
let's pray.
all right, do you see anything that looks familiar?
well, maybe if you slowed down.
wait. That's them.
those right there.
are you private Jackson Reynolds?
Yes.
Yes, I am. That's me.
Hallelujah. We have pants. Ok.
do you see a light?
see you, guys. Later.
I have something for you.
it's plans for a model that your dad drew.
he was building it for your birthday.
this is amazing.
my dad drew this?
it is. Wait.
why do you have them?
because I saw his partner.
look, Ned, I know that this is gonna sound really crazy, but the ghost that's been haunting you.
it's your dad.
what? Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
and I think that he's stuck in one of those confused states.
it sometimes happens. He won't talk to me, but he might talk to you if you'd be willing.
Oh, my god.
when?
Ned, you know that you're gonna have to tell him to move on, to cross over.
what?
why would I do that?
because.
he's meant to be in the light, you know, not here.
and it's not good for spirits to stick around too long.
it's hurting your dad.
it's hurting you guys.
that's not true.
OK, look, I know that you really want your dad to be here.
I wanted my dad, too, but the longer that he's here, it makes it worse on everyone.
don't touch me!
dad wants to be with us.
I'll never make him go.
so, I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do here.
I was kinda young when we did these.
I'd always mess 'em up, and you'd fix 'em later when I wasn't looking.
but I'll be better now.
the thing is, dad, I miss you.
you were just so great, you know.
there was nobody like you.
can you hear me, dad?
are you there?
look, mom, I can explain everything.
honey, you don't have to.
I understand.
you miss him.
I do, too.
you know, sometimes you feel ok, and then--Bam, something reminds you of him, and you're right back to where you were.
it gets better.
I promise.
I promise.
so maybe we could move, somewhere that no one would ever come and visit, like the antarctic or queens.
you're still gonna have to tell Delia.
Yeah, I know, but when I do, who's to say that she's gonna be able to get charlie to move on?
I mean, he was pretty clear about the fact that he's not going anywhere.
then I'd be out a friend, a coworker, and I'd gain a crazy ghost.
you really think he's crazy?
I don't know. It just gives me the creeps, the way that he's just trying to fit right back in with the family.
Yeah. One minute, he's with them, and then the next, he gets shot at an atm.
I could see how that could make you crazy.
look, I probably should have mentioned this before, but I think tim's got a ghost attached to him.
what?
um, I'm not really sure, but he's got that look in his eyes.
he keeps talking about purple flowers and some song he keeps hearing.
Oh, god.
it's Charlie, right?
Yeah, trying to protect Delia.
now I really have to tell her.
honey, I think when you tell Delia your secret, you will feel relieved.
you do? - Yes.
I think this has been harder on you than you think, keepin' it inside.
I think when you let it out, everything'll be better.
I don't know who gave you the best husband handbook, but you're really good at it.
this fell out of your pants.
I think it's what's keeping you here.
she was the most beautiful, passionate, sexy woman I'd ever met.
I was gonna ask her to marry me that night, but then we had this stupid argument.
so why didn't you?
Aw, she brought that dumb, yippy dog to the restaurant in her purse.
have you ever tried to ask someone to marry you with a dog yipping?
the worst.
I got steamed, and I left.
I went to a buddy's, had a few beers.
all right, like ten.
had this crazy idea to run down to the lake.
without trunks.
it was spur of the moment.
I slipped on something.
I wanted to marry her.
she never even knew.
she will now.
who were you just talkin'.
what is up?
you know, the other day, you called somebody Charlie, and now you're talkin' to yourself.
uh, actually I'm--I'm glad that you brought that up.
OK.
you know how sometimes when you.
you know how you think that I.
how do I say this?
Oh, my god.
are you pregnant?
you're pregnant, aren't you?
no.
no, I'm not pregnant.
I see ghosts.
you're kidding, right?
no.
no, I'm not kidding, actually.
that--that's insane.
wh-why would you tell me this?
because you have a ghost attached to you.
look, delia, I know how you feel about this stuff, and I really
I really didn't wanna have to tell you, but the reason that I am is because the ghost that's attached to you is charlie.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
you told Ned this, didn't you?
Yes, but he already knew, because he had seen me talking to one once.
and I know that I should have told you first, and I'm so sorry.
how dare you mess with my kid like that?
he thinks his dad's ghost is here.
I heard him talking to him, for god's sake.
well, he was.
Ch-charlie - just stop. Stop it.
you need help.
you need help, Melinda.
and if you ever, ever talk to my son again, so help me, god.
how many times did I walk in here and see you talking to yourself or acting all jittery?
and I never said a word, never.
I just thought you were quirky.
but it turns out you are nuts.
and by the way, I quit.
things are not better.
now that she knows, they're worse.
I'm sorry.
I wish it would go away.
I wish that I could wake up tomorrow and it would just be gone.
don't say that.
you do too much good with your gift.
you help too many people.
what good is it if it hurts the people that I love?
Andrea, Delia, it did not help them.
I can figure out perfect strangers' ghosts, but I can't help my friends.
that is not a gift.
were you playing with your dad's cologne?
Ned, were you in your dad's stuff?
Ned, if this is one of your pranks.
mom spending the night at Grants Ned.
I want you to tell me what the hell is going on.
this is crazy.
I smelled his cologne.
how are you doing this?
I'm not doing anything.
OK, think about it.
what would I gain by tricking you or anyone?
I am not buying any of this, melinda.
there's obviously some kind of explanation for it.
Yeah, there is.
you just don't wanna know about it.
so you're saying Charlie is here because he's trying to protect me.
Yes.
from what?
other men.
I don't know.
I don't know, ok?
it doesn't have to be rational.
trauma can affect people's personalities dead or alive.
you know, it's like chad. I mean, he said
you spoke with chad?
he--he said that.
you know, it was hard for Charlie.
he was not the same after the fire.
that fire was the best thing that ever happened to charlie.
Really?
Charlie was a workaholic.
for the first 7 years of ned's life, he was just this weekend warrior dad.
so then what happened?
I don't know why we are talking about this.
because I...
I really wanna know.
I don't know what happened, but there was something about that fire.
we never talked about it.
but afterwards, he was much happier.
I just remember him saying all the time, over and over again.
I just don't wanna wake up one day thinking it was all a waste.
Charlie was obsessed about not wasting his life.
Thanks, but what does that have to do with the fire?
he started saying that stuff after the building burned.
report is printing.
you know, everyone keeps saying that something changed about charlie that day.
nobody seems to know what.
I know about you, charlie.
you can stop hiding from me.
you don't know anything.
I know that tim's the guy that rescued you from the fire.
see, I was thinking that it was like all the other guys you were driving away from Delia, but that's not true, is it?
I told you to keep out of this.
so then I was thinking the lavender roses, the song, the bike-- all things that Delia likes.
you're not trying to keep them apart.
you want them to be together.
look, you've already put everything I've worked for at risk.
I just need a little more time.
and I just need to know why you're doing this.
I was workin' late.
I was the only one in the office.
hurry up, guys.
come on!
hurry up!
I just saw my life going down in flames.
don't go in there!
I didn't listen.
and I realized right at that moment that it wasn't about the files.
it was about my life with Ned and Delia.
when I came to, I was-- I was delirious.
I remember, uh, lookin' up into that face, and just I was so happy to be alive.
I was so happy to get a second chance.
thank you so much.
I told him I would never forget him, I would...
I would never forget how he risked his life to save mine, but he told me he didn't see it that way.
he just tried to do the best he could with every day that he had.
I'll never wake up thinkin' it was all a waste, you know.
he just knew what took me so long to realize, and thank god I did, because 3 years later, I was gone.
so you wanted him to take care of ned and delia.
I just knew he was the one, you know? I felt it.
so she starts dating, and you make sure that they all go badly.
and it was goin' fine until you butted in.
I'm the one who wanted them to be together, so why wouldn't you just come to me?
cause I didn't trust you.
so instead you gave hints to tim on how to win her over.
not the greatest plan.
Oh, I did much more than that.
it was a long time ago.
I knew she needed the lamps for her open house.
damn.
so I sent her to you.
come on, mom. I'm gonna be late.
let's go.
and you brought her to tim.
you know, it may not work out, but I wanted them at least to have a chance.
tim rescued my dad?
she's never gonna believe you, but at least she likes tim now, so you can't completely screw things up.
thanks for the vote of confidence.
who are you talking to?
she's talking to dad, mom.
he's here.
Ned, it's time to say good-bye.
it's time for him to go, but before he does, he wants to tell you why he tried to scare you in the basement.
don't you?
I did a lot of crazy things when I was a kid, startin' about your age, and, uh.
it got me into a whole bunch of trouble, and I still regret it.
and I just wanna keep you from having to go through all that.
Ned, your dad did a lot of messed-up things when he was your age, and he just wants to keep you from making those same mistakes.
I--I get it, and I'm glad you came back, dad, but you don't have to worry about us anymore.
I can take care of things.
I know you can, son.
you grew up so well.
I'm proud of you, buddy.
all I want is you to be happy now.
I want you to find the love you deserve.
wh-what was that?
he's saying good-bye, and he says that he wants you to be happy now.
and to find love.
I'm sorry, but i just--I can't
what if charlie wasn't dead?
what if he was here and you had no doubt?
what would you say?
mom.
please.
I would.
I would say that he made me happy, too, more than he could ever know.
that he gave me peace, and I would.
I would say,"I love you,
and that,"I will always, always love you.
I love you.
I love you both so much.
he loves you, too.
both of you.
and thank you.
I just thought I'd - you know what?
before you say anything, can I just.
I'm really sorry that I went behind your back with ned.
I know you are.
thank you.
here's the thing.
I think the reason why I got so mad, so hurt is because you're just so important to me.
you have been such an amazing friend, and I know you're a good person.
I know you are.
just nuts.
Yeah, slightly nuts.
but I don't wanna lose your friendship, and I just...
I just can't go where you go.
can you understand that?
I understand that.
how did he know lavender roses were my favorite?
do you really wanna know?
tomorrow, you want me to open up?
that would be great.
thank you.
what ARE WE IN THE MOOD FOR TONIGHT?
why ARE WE USING THE ROYAL WE?
I WONDER IF THE POST OFFICE WOULD KEEP RECORDS OF PEOPLE'S ADDRESS CHANGE.
I MEAN, DETECTIVES TRACK PEOPLE DOWN,HOW DID THEY DO THAT?
we're TALKING TO OURSELVES, LIKE THE OTHER ONE'S NOT THERE.
I'm SORRY, DID YOU SAY SOMETHING JUST NOW?
What'd YOU SAY ABOUT A DETECTIVE?
something ABOUT YOUR DAD?
Yeah. I CAN'T TRACK HIM DOWN ANYWHERE.
if YOU CAN'T FIND IT, I WON'T KNOW HOW HE LIVED ALL THESE YEARS OR HOW HE DIED.
maybe HE'LL FIND YOU。。。
like HE FOUND YOU IN THAT DREAM.
hmm. I'M SURE HE WILL HELP ME.
what FOR?
you KNOW THAT GHOST I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.
the ONE AT THE CITY HALL ARCHIVES?
Yeah, THE ONE WHO ACTS LIKE HE'S GUARDIN' THE PLACE.
Yeah, HE MADE ALL THOSE WEIRD THREATS TO ME,
he SAID THAT THERE BEING ANGRY SPIRITS DOWN THERE
and SOME SERIOUS DARKNESS IN GRANDVIEW.
all RIGHT, WAIT A MINUTE.
you're NOT REALLY WORRIED ABOUT US, LIKE WE'RE IN DANGER?
definitely NOT， WITH JIM CLANCY OUT THERE IN HIS UNIFORM.
Hey.
go TO WORK AND DON'T COME BACK UNTIL PEOPLE ARE HEALTHY AND SAFE.
go TO WORK.
sleep WELL.
Hey, AL, USE THIS MIRROR.
Yeah. THANKS.
see YA.
no.
No!
no
Hey.
Oh. HI.
they TOLD ME YOU'D BE UP HERE.
are YOU READY FOR BREAKFAST? I'M BUYING?
Thanks, BUT CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING FIRST?
SURE.WHAT'S UP?
we BROUGHT THIS GIRL IN,
AMINACID CATECHOLAMINES FLOODING HER NEURALS,
and THAT RESULT WAS ACUTE CATATONIA.
that WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY INTERESTING HAD IT BEEN IN ENGLISH.
you SEE, I THINK IT SOUNDS A LITTLE CRAZY TO SAY IN ENGLISH.
I THINK THIS GIRL WAS ALMOST SCARED TO DEATH.
how?
washing HER FACE IN A BATHROOM.
according TO ONE OF HER FRIENDS,
before SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS, THE LAST WOR OUT OF HER MOUTH.
were, "BLOODY MARY."
bloody MARY? LIKE THE DRINK?
no, LIKE BLOODY MARY, THE GHOST.
Oh, YOU MEAN BLOODY MARY, THE URBAN MYTH.
I DON'T KNOW.
you're THE EXPERT, YOU TELL ME.
can YOU SEE US?
what REALLY HAPPENED?
nobody SAW.
THEY'RA RUN TESTS,
but THE TOX SCREENS COULD TAKE DAYS.
look AT HER FACE.
something SCARED HER.
bloody MARY.
what's THE LEGEND ABOUT?
you'd STAND IN A FRONT OF A MIRROR,
you CALL OUT HER， NUTLOODY MARY.
turn AROUND, AND THEN SHE COMES THROUGH THE MIRROR
and SCARES YOU TO DEATH.
hey...
what DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T KNOW.
tell ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT BLOODY MARY.
are YOU KIDDING ME? YOU'RE, LIKE, THE 100th PERSON TH'S ASKED ME ABOUT BLOODY MARY TODAY.
well, NEWS TRAVELS FAST.
Yeah, ALL OVER CAMPUS KNOW.
it's LIKE A FULL-BLOWN MANIA.
some STUDENTS CLAMORING TO GET INTO MY CLASS,
and I HAVE OFFERED A LITTLE ELIRA CREDIT FOR ANYONE THAT DOES THE BLOODY MARY RITUAL,
and THE FIRST KID THAT DIES,I'M GIVING AN AUTOMATIC "A.
that's A LITTLE GHOULISH, DON'T YOU THINK?
Nah. I'M JUST RIDING THE CYBERWAVE.
CYBERWAVE? WHAT'S A CYBERWAVE?
OK, I KNOW YOU LIVE IN THE WORLD OF ANTIQUES
and DEAD THINGS AND DEAD PEOPLE, BUT US,
normal PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING,
we HAVE THIS LITTLE INVENTION THAT WE LIKE TO CALL...
ready? TA-DA! THE INTERNET.
and BLOODY MARY IS ALL OVER IT.
wait. SO THERE ARE WHOLE SITES
devoted TO ONE URBAN MYTH?
Oh, YEAH. THERE'S BLOODY MARY SITES ALL OVER THE WORLD.
whatever AREA THE MYTH TAKES PLACE IN,
you CHANGE THE MYTH TO FIT LOCAL LORE.
so WHAT'S THE ROCKLAND U. VERSION?
it STARTS THE USUAL WAY.
you LOOK INTO A MIRROR AND SAY HER NAME.
a FEW TIMES OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,
and THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, BLOODY MARY APPEARS BEHIND YOU. VERY SCARY.
but THEN HERE'S WHERE THE ROCKLAND U. STUDENTS,
who I NORMALLY MOCK, BECAUSE THEIR BRAINS ARE TINY.
mushy, AND UNFORMED, THEY GOT VERY CREATIVE ON ME.
you GO INTO SOME SORT OF SUSPENDED STATE?
Mary APPEARS IN FRONT OF YOU UNTIL YOU CRAZY,
and THEN ON THE FOUTH DAY, YOU DIE.
and THIS IS WHAT THEY THINK WILL HAPPEN TO THE GIRL WHO COLLAPSED YESTERDAY?
here's A HINT.
Hi. EXCUSE ME.
my NAME IS MELINDA.
I'm SO SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT ALLISION.
could I TALK TO YOU GUYS FOR A SECOND?
who ARE YOU?
my HUSBAND IS THE PARAMEDIC WHO BROUGHT HER IN.
OK. WHAT DO YOU WANNA KNOW?
anything THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER.
did SOMEBODY HEAR HER SAY, "BLOODY MARY,"RIGHT BEFORE SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS?
UM.。。。WE AREN'T THERE,
so WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
we JUST CAME WHEN WE HEARD THAT ALLISON,
UM...SHE...SHE WAS SICK.
you CAN TALK TO ME. I'M NOT ONE OF THE POLICE,
and I DON'T WORK FOR THE UNIVERSITY, SO。。。
but WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY.
she HEARD THE NOISE.
what NOISE?
I KNOW THAT THIS MAY SOUND STRANGE,
but IF YOU'RE SCARED OF, ANYTHING,
I THINK THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU,
but YOU HAVE TO HELP ME. I NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT ALLISON, LIKE DID ANYONE AROUND HER DIE RECENTLY.
family OR CLOSE FRIENDS?
what DOES IT MATTER?
that's HARD TO EXPLAIN.
OK, I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE,
but UNLESS YOU'RE A DOCTOR OR A FAMILY MEMBER,
you NEED TO LEAVE US ALONE.
OK, THAT IS THE THING ABOUT BLOODY MARY.
there ARE SO MANY LEGENDS, THAT YOU CAN HAVE 2 IN ONE TOWN.
re's THE ROCKLAND U. VERSN,
and NOW THERE'S A GRANDVIEW VERSION ALSO?
Yes, BUT TECHNICALLY THGhROCKLAND UNIVERSITY VERSION
derives FROM THE TOWN VERSION.
that's WHY MY STUDENTS WENT SO CRAZY.
when THEY FOUND OUT THEY HAD THEIR OWN LOCAL GHOST,
I MEAN THEY。。。ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANNA LIGHT CANDLES?
this STORY IS WAY BETTER WITH ATMOSPHERE.
positive.
it WOULD GO A LOT BETTER WITH YOUR NEW DECOR.
get TO IT- IT'S KIND OF DARK.
OK, UH, MARY LIVED IN GRANDVIEW ABOUT 150 YEARS AGO.
she WAS A TEENAGER, SHE GOT A DISEASE,
and SHE GOES TO THE DOCTOR AFTER SLIPPING INTO A COMA.
the DOCTOR DECLARES HER DEAD. YOU KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING?
to THE END OF THE STORY.
anyway, MARY GOES INTO THE GROUND,
and THEY TIE A STRING AROUND HER HAND,
runs UP TO THE SURFACE, WHICH IS ATTACHED TO A BELL ON TOP OF THE GROUND.
that WAY, IF SHE EVER WAKES UP ,CAUSE SHE'S NOT REALLY DEAD,
in THAT CASE- A DEAD RINGER.
Mmm. MELINDA GORDON, YOU LISTEN.
I LIKE THAT ABOUT YOU. OK. SO?
Mary's PARENTS ARE SO GRIEF-STRICKEN,
they REALLY TIE ONE ON THAT NIGHT,
and I DON'T MEAN TIE ONE ON LIKE A STRING AROUND THE HAND.
they GET HAMMERED.
when THEY WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING,
they LOOK AT THE BELL. THEY SEE THAT THE BELL IS。。。
as THE KIDS SAY OFF THE HOOK.
what ARE THEY GONNA DO?
they HAVE TO DIG HER BACK UP, OPEN THE COFFIN LID.
except NOW IT'S WAY TOO LATE.
she's REALLY DEAD.
on THE INSIDE OF THE COFFIN,
there's BLOODY SCRATCH MARKS INSIDE THE COFFIN LID.
that's IT? YOU JUST GO BACK TO YOUR I. M.ing?
you're LIKE MY STUDENTS.
OK. SO THEN IT ALL MAKES SENSE.
all THE BLOGS STARTED OUT BY SAYING
that A BELL WOULD RING， AND THEN BLOODY MARY WOULD APPEAR.
which MUST BE WHAT ALLISON'S FRIEND IN THE HOSPITAL MEANT.
she SAID THAT ALLISON HEARD A NOISE.
GHOSTO, YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING.
OK, I DO AGREE THAT IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH A GHOST.
I DID SEE SOMETHING IN ALLISON'S HOSPITAL ROOM,
but I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH BLOODY MARY.
why WOULD A CENTURY-OLD GHOST SHOW UP AND TERRORIZE COEDS?
maybe SHE WAS TIRED OF GETTING HER BELL RUNG.
whatever IS OR ISN'T HAUNTING ALLISON IS ABOUT HER,
but I'M NOT GONNA KNOW WHAT SHE SAW UNTIL SHE WAKES UP.
you MEAN IF SHE WAKES UP.
that MYTH DOES NOT PROVE THAT ANYTHING IS GONNA HAPPEN.
Jen, YOU GOTTA GET REAL.
if PEOPLE ARE DUMB ENOUGH TO BELIEVE IN GHOSTS,
then GUESS WHAT. IT'S LIKE THEY DESERVE TO GET SCARED OUT OF THEIR MINDS.
it's LIKE THEY BASICALLY ASKED FOR IT.
Allison DID NOT ASK FOR THAT.
she's NOT IN A COMA CAUSE SHE SAW BLOODY MARY.
please, WOULD YOU PLEASE NOT SAY THAT NAME?
come ON.
no.
please DON'T DO THIS.
please DON'T.
Hey, I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THIS, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE.
that's WHAT I WOULD LOOK LIKE IF I SAW A GHOST.
how DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS SO FAST?
I MEAN, IS IT ALREADY ON THE NET?
I CAME BACK TO MY OFFICE, AND YOU KNOW ME.
I HEAR AN AMBULANCE, I COME RUNNING.
I'm PRETTY SURE YOU TOLD ME THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN, RIGHT?
will YOU JUST TELL ME WHERE IT HAPPENED?
I'm PAID TO BE A SKEPTIC.
I'm JUST RUNNING OUT OF REASONS TO DOUBT THE MYTH.
how ABOUT THE REASON.
I SEE GHOSTS. OTHER PEOPLE DON'T.
OK, BUT YOU'RE FORGETTING ABOUT THE ONE ELEMENT.
that RUNS THROUGH ALL VERSIONS OF THE MYTH, AND THAT'S THE MIRRORS.
I'm NOT FORGETTING IT. I'M IGNORING IT.
the BELL, THE REST OF IT.
it ALL MAKES A GOOD STORY. IT DOESN'T MAKE IT REAL.
excuse ME. SIR, THAT CAR IS BEING EXAMINED BY CAMPUS SECURITY.
it's OK. I'M RICK PAYNE,
anthropology OF THE OCCULT.
I'll TAKE IT FROM HERE.
where ARE WE GOING?
this IS IT.
this IS WHERE JENNA WAS FOUND.
while WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT OF THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW,
let ME GIVE YOU MY CONDENSED LECTURE ON MIRRORS,
and THEIR PLACE THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND THE SUPERNATURAL.
the FIRST QUEEN ELIZABETH,
she HAD HER OWN PERSONAL MAGICIAN
who WOULD USE A MIRROR TO DESCRIBE THE FUTURE.
and THE GREEKS. DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE GREEKS.
this IS THE CONDENSED VERSION?
Yes, BUT YOU JUST MADE IT A LITTLE BIT LONGER.
the GREEKS THOUGHT THAT ANY REFLECTIVE SURFACE WOULD DO.
they EVEN BELIEVE THAT UNSUSPECTING,
souls COULD BE PULLED UNDERWATER BY EVIL SPIRITS
lurking UNDERNEATH THE WATER. WHY?
did YOU JUST DO A FLOURISH?
I GUESS I DID. I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
because CULTURES THROUGHOUT SPACE AND TIME HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT MIRRORS ARE SORT OF A VEIL BETWEEN OUR WORLD AND OTHERS.
as A PORTAL,YOU CNA THINK SO.
OK, SO LET'S SAY THAT BLOODY MARY USES MIRRORS AS PORTALS.
one PROBLEM. WHERE'S THE MIRROR IN HERE?
saved BY THE BELL.
who's OPENING WHOSE MIND NOW?
who YOU GONNA CALL THE NEXT TIME YOU HAVE A GHOST PLUGGIN' UP YOUR WORKS?
who I SHOULD HAVE CALLED ALL ALONG.
OK, WE COULD DO THIS FACE TO FACE,
but MIRRORS ARE YOUR THING.
bloody MARY.
bloody MARY.
bloody MARY.
Mel, ARE YOU DOWN HERE?
Hey, WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO WITH THIS GREAT ART NOUVEAU CLOCK?
are YOU OK?
you LOOK LIKE YOU JUST SAW A。。。
nothing. NOPE. DIDN'T SEE A THING.
I THOUGHT SO.
you WERE CALLING HER,
weren't YOU? THAT GHOST OF BLOODY MARY?
how DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HER?
are YOU KIDDING? EVERY TIME I GO TO CHECK MY E-MAIL,
my SON'S GOT THE BROWSER ON THAT PAGE. ALL HIS FRIENDS ARE INTO IT.
it's ALL SO RIDICULOUS.
why DO THESE KIDS WANNA DO THIS?
what, SCARE THEMSELVES?
just LIKE GOIN' ON A ROLLER COASTER, I GUESS.
you HAVE TO FACE SOMETHING THAT FEELS LIKE DEATH,
you COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE,
and THEN SUDDENLY YOU FEEL SO ALIVE.
ha! I FOUND YOU! YOU WERE LYING.
what?
it's A COMMENT PAGE.
talking ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO JENNA.
look AT WHAT THIS PERSON SAYS.
stop IT. YOU GUYS ARE MAKING IT WORSE.
how MANY PEOPLE DO YOU WANT TO GET HURT
before YOU LEARN?" SIGNED "S. A.
now IF I GO TO JENNA'S WEBPAGE,
check OUT HER B. F.F. s.
Allison, A GIRL NAMED CLAIRE,
and SLOANE ALEXANDER, THE FRIEND FROM THE HOSPITAL,
who TOLD ME SHE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BLOODY MARY.
here's SLOANE'S WEBSITE.
whoa. DID YOU SEE THAT?
see WHAT?
I GOTTA GET DOWN THERE.
who?
it's YOU.
this IS GONNA SOUND STRANGE,
but I KNOW A FEW THINGS ABOUT GHOSTS.
you're NOT LAUGHING.
I'm SO SORRY. I'M NOT USED TO THAT.
I HAVE 2 FRIENDS IN THE HOSPITAL. I'M PROBABLY NEXT.
you WERE SAYING?
OK. WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
most OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT BLOODY MARY ARE VERY UNLIKELY.
ancient SPIRITS DON'T USUALLY JUMP OUT OF MIRRORS AND TRY TO KILL PEOPLE.
number 2, GHOSTS CAN SCARE YOU,
but THEY CAN'T DO MORE THAN THAT UNLESS YOU LET THEM.
we CAN STOP THIS TOGETHER,
but YOU HAVE TO HELP ME FIGURE OUT WHO SHE IS,
and WHY SHE WOULD WANNA DO THIS TO YOU.
for A SECOND THERE, I ACTUALLY BELIEVED YOU.
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT I MIGHT BE OK.
you WILL BE OK.
you JUST HAVE TO HELP ME FIND THE CONNECTION.
why SHOULD I HELP YOU?
you DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
you're WRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING.
the LEGEND IS ALL TRUE, EVERY DETAIL.
you CALL BLOODY MARY, YOU HEAR THE BELL,
she COMES THROUGH THE MIRROR, AND THEN YOU DIE.
but NO ONE HAS DIED. IT'S JUST A STORY.
you're WRONG. RACHEL DIED. I WAS THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED.
Rachel? WHO'S RACHEL?
she WAS ONE OF JENNA'S SUITEMATES.
just BEFORE SEMESTER BREAK, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BLOGS AND STUFF,
what KIDS WERE SAYING ABOUT BLOODY MARY.
it's REAL.
Allison, SHE WAS LIKE OBSESSED,
especially WHEN SHE HEARD THAT THE REAL BLOODY MARY,
had ACTUALLY LIVED IN GRANDVIEW,
her PARENTS WERE FOUNDERS OF THE COLLEGE.
Allison SWORE A ROOMMATE OF HER EX-BOYFRIEND'S HAD ACTUALLY SEEN THE GHOST.
when HE LOOKED UP IN THE MIRROR,
bloody MARY WAS STANDING RIGHT BACK AT HIM.
shut UP. YOU ARE SUCH A LIAR.
I SWEAR IT.
prove IT.
I DARE YOU.
go ON.
you GO DO IT.
are YOU KIDDING ME?
I'll DO IT.
we WERE KIND OF IMPRESSED, ACTUALLY.
good LUCK.
she WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD THE GUTS.
the REST OF US COULDN'T GET OUT OF THE BATHROOM FAST ENOUGH.
bloody MARY.
bloody MARY.
bloody MARY.
Rachel WENT INTO A COMA, AND 4 DAYS LATER, SHE DIED.
I've NEVER HEARD ANY OF THIS.
it WAS LAST SPRING,
and THE UNIVERSITY DOESN'T EXACTLY ADVERTISE UNEXPLAINED DEATHS ON CAMPUS.
for A WHILE, PEOPLE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS A DRUG OVERDOSE.
but YOU KNEW BETTER.
we WERE SO SCARED.
we MADE A PACT TO NEVER TELL ANYONE HOW IT HAPPENED,
but THEN WHEN WE CAME BACK AFTER SEMESTER BREAK,
all THIS WEIRD STUFF STARTED TO HAPPEN.
it WAS LIKE MARY KNEW WE WERE BACK。。。
like SHE WAS WATCHING US.
there WERE ALL THESE WEIRD NOISES.
there WAS STUFF WE THOUGHT WE WERE SEEING IN MIRRORS.
and YOU THINK ALL THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE YOU CALLED OUT A GHOST'S NAME?
Rachel CALLED HER, BUT IT WAS OUR IDEA,
and NOW MARY'S COMING FOR EVERYONE THERE WHO HELPED WAKE HER UP.
listen, I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.
no, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.
OK, MAYBE I DON'T.
but WILL YOU AT LEAST LET ME HELP YOU?
you DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS ALONE.
no, IT'S TOO LATE NOW.
my BEST FRIENDS ARE GONE, AND I'M PROBABLY NEXT,
and ANYONE I TOLD WOULD THINK I WAS NUTS.
Sloane, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
I'm SORRY. I NEED YOU TO GO.
OK, WELL, IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.
good MORNING-HEY.
Hey, YOU KNOW?
it TURNS OUT EVERYTHING SLOANE TOLD YOU ABOUT RACHEL CHECKS OUT.
she WAS PICKED UP IN KIRKFIELD HALL,
unresponsive, TRANSFERRED TO MERCY,
declared COMATOSE, AND SHE DIED 4 DAYS LATER.
so WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF DEATH?
complications FROM HEART FAILURE.
is IT REALLY POSSIBLE TO BE SCARED TO DEATH.
sure, IF IT'S BAD ENOUGH.
you GET THIS FLOOD OF CHEMICALS TO YOUR HEART,
creates A SHOCK SOME PEOPLE CAN'T SURVIVE.
that's JUST DELIGHTFUL.
Oh, IT GETS WORSE.
listen, MY BUDDY AT THE HOSPITAL TOLD ME
Jenna IS SHOWING EXACTLY THE SAME SYMPTOMS AS ALLISON,
just A DAY LATER.
we HAVEN'T HAD A SINGLE TEST POSITIVE FOR ANY MEDICAL CAUSE FOR THEIR CATATONIC STATES.
all THE RUMORS ONLINE ARE GETTING CRAZY.
it's LIKE THIS THING HAS A LIFE OF ITS OWN.
Oh, BABE, I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU YOUR JOB.
I WON'T DO THAT.
but WE GOT THE 2 GIRLS IN THE HOSPITAL.
they're SERIOUS. THERE'S NO OTHER EXPLANATION.
is IT POSSIBLE IT COULD BE THE MYTH?
Yes.
of COURSE. ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE,
and IF ANYTHING, MY JOB HAS TAUGHT ME THAT,
but I'M SORRY. I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
you DON'T BELIEVE IT, OR YOU DON'T WANT TO?
what DOES THAT MEAN?
all IT MEANS IS IF IT'S TRUE,
there's A WHOLE LOT MORE TO THIS GHOST WORLD THAN YOU GOT A HANDLE ON.
you KNOW, IF IT'S TRUE, MAYBE
your GHOST DOWN IN THE ARCHIVES IS TELLIN' THE TRUTH.
what? THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF DARKNESS IN GRANDVIEW?
Yeah.
Hey.
remember ME?
I NEED TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON A GIRL WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN BURIED。。。
don't TELL ME. BLOODY MARY.
if THAT'S ACTUALLY WHO SHE WAS, THEN YES.
for THE 10, 000th TIME TODAY,
there ARE NO SUCH RECORDS I KNOW OF,
so KINDLY LOOK ELSEWHERE.
um, NO.
no?
no. THIS IS PUBLIC PROPERTY.
those ARE PUBLIC RECORDS, AND I AM THE PUBLIC,
so UNLESS YOU WANNA DECLARE MARTIAL LAW,
I'm GONNA BE GOING THIS WAY.
you're PLUCKY.
you're GUTSY.
those ARE EXCELLENT TRAITS IN A PERSON WHO WANTS TO GET BADLY HURT.
Yeah, YOU TOLD ME THAT BEFORE.
you HEAR WHAT I JUST SAID TO THE ARCHIVIST.
what DO YOU WANNA TELL ME?
you CAN'T JUST LEAVE THE DEAD TO REST, RIGHT?
I'll LET THEM REST WHEN THEY LET ME REST.
do YOU KNOW SOMETHING OR NOT?
she's REAL。。。
but NOT EVERYTHING YOU'VE HEARD IS TRUE.
some OF THE MOST。。。
interesting DETAILS ARE MISSING.
such AS?
I'm SURE YOU'VE HEARD THAT THE DOCTOR WRONGLY PRONOUNCED MARY DEAD,
but DO YOU KNOW WHO THE DOCTOR WAS?
it WAS MARY'S OWN FATHER.
they LIVED IN THE BIG HOUSE ON OAK SHADOW LANE.
it's EMPTY NOW, BUT IT WAS ONCE THE HOME OF DR. HORACE MUMFORD,
his WIFE, AND THEIR ONLY CHILD, MARY.
poor MARY HAD DIPTHERIA,
which WAS INCURABLE IN THOSE DAYS,
not TO MENTION EXTREMELY CONTAGIOUS.
Dr. MUMFORD FELT THEY HAD TO BURY HIS DAUGHTER RIGHT AWAY.
with THE CHANCE THAT THE BELL MIGHT RING,
Mary's MOTHER WOULD NOT LEAVE THE GRAVE.
the GOOD DOCTOR KNEW THAT SHE WOULD DIE OF EXPOSURE IF SHE DIDN'T COME INSIDE.
luckily, HE HAD SOME MORPHINE.
you KNOW THE REST.
by THE TIME THEY GOT TO MARY,
she WAS DEAD。。。
by THE DOCTOR'S OWN HAND.
you're RIGHT. I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED.
wait.
you'll MISS THE BEST PART.
you SEE, WHEN THEY FINALLY GOT MARY UP, HER HANDS WERE BLOODY, THEY MISSED IT AT FIRST.
Mary's NAILS WERE GONE.
they WERE STUCK IN THE LID OF THE COFFIN.
Mary. ARE YOU HERE?
I JUST WANNA TALK TO YOU.
don't YOU WANNA TALK TO SOMEONE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?
hello.
are YOU CATATONIC YET?
practically.
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WERE EVER GONNA CALL ME BACK.
did YOU GET ME IN?
as IT TURNS OUT,
bloody MARY'S ANCESTRAL HOME
is ONE OF GRANDVIEW'S REGISTERED HISTORIC BUILDINGS,
and THE PRESERVATION SOCIETY IS RUN
by THE CHAIR OF OUR ARCHITECTURE SCHOOL,
who IS A VERY BAD POKER PLAYER, AND HE OWES ME $138.
by THE WAY, THE COMBINATION TO THE KEY BOX IS K-E-Y.
so I GUESS NOW I OWE YOU A FAVOR.
Yeah, AND $138.
Mary.
why WON'T YOU SHOW YOURSELF?
I KNOW YOU'RE HERE.
I KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN IN THE SAME ROOM BEFORE.
OK. IF THESE ARE THE RULES。。。
bloody MARY.
bloody MARY.
bloody MARY.
do YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
do YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE?
why AREN'T YOU LOOKING AT ME?
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU...
you ACTUALLY SAW BLOODY MARY, THE REAL THING?
I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE IT EITHER.
I WAS AT HER FAMILY HOME.
I SAID HER NAME 3 TIMES. SHE APPEARED.
her HANDS WERE BLOODY.
but WHAT?
he HAD ALL HER FINGERNAILS.
maybe THE ARCHIVE GHOST GOT HIS FACTS WRONG.
maybe, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.
the BELL, IT SOUNDED OFF,
it DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A 100-YEAR-OLD BELL.
honey, I DON'T THINK CAST-IRON BELL TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED MUCH.
no, IT DIDN'T SOUND REAL.
clipped, LIKE-- LIKE IT WAS A RECORDING.
I DON'T THINK THIS IS A CENTURY-OLD GHOST.
all RIGHT, YOU'RE BACK TO BELIEVING THE GHOST.
is SOMEONE WHO KNEW THE GIRLS, SOMEONE WHO DIED,
someone WHO HAD UNFINISHED BUSINESS.
Yes.
no-no.
not SOMEONE WHO KNEW THE GIRLS.
one OF THE GIRLS.
4 GIRLS PLAYED BLOODY MARY THAT NIGHT.
2 ARE CATATONIC, ONE IS CONVINCED THAT SHE'S NEXT,
but ONLY ONE GIRL DIED, THE FIRST ONE, RACHEL.
you're SAYING THAT OUR DAUGHTER RACHEL DIED FROM PLAYING WHAT?
it's KIND OF A GHOST STORY,
that WAS SPREAD AND NOW HAS TAKEN ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN.
I'm SORRY.YOU ARE。。。
we SENT OUR DAUGHTER TO COLLEGE.
we LET HER LIVE IN THE DORM,
even THOUGH WE WERE A HALF-HOUR DRIVE AWAY,
which I KNEW WAS A BIG MISTAKE.
bill, PLEASE.
and THE FIRST TIME WE GO TO PICK HER UP。。。
we're SENT TO A COUNTY MORGUE.
I WOULDN'T ASK YOU TO REMEMBER ANY OF THIS.
if IT WEREN'T FOR HER FRIENDS AT THE HOSPITAL.
they NEED YOUR HELP.
what CAN WE DO?
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS HOPING TO FIND OUT.
more INFORMATION ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP.
she NEVER MENTIONED ANY OF THOSE NAMES.
no. RACHEL HAD A HARD TIME MAKING FRIENDS.
and WHY WAS THAT?
my WIFE WILL TELL YOU.
that THAT WAS MY FAULT.
that's NOT.
Rachel WAS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER KIDS.
how?
she HAD A V. S.D.
it's A SEPTAL DEFECT,
a HOLE BETWEEN THE CHAMBERS.
and SHE KNEW ABOUT THAT?
from THE TIME THAT SHE WAS A CHILD,
which WAS WHY WE COULD NOT ALLOW HER TO PLAY SPORTS.
she HAD TO BE HOME-SCHOOLED.
we TOOK EVERY PRECAUTION.
don't MEAN TO PRY, BUT DID YOUR DAUGHTER BY ANY CHANCE WEAR A HEART MONITOR?
absolutely, 24 HOURS A DAY.
and HOW DID IT WORK?
when HER HEART GOT TOO STRESSED,
it WOULD EMIT A SOUND.
what KIND OF SOUND?
like AN ALARM.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I CAN HELP YOU NOW.
it DOESN'T MATTER.
I'm LEAVING SCHOOL.
my PARENTS ARE COMING FROM MAINE.
they're PICKING ME UP TOMORROW.
Yeah, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
bloody MARY IS NOT AFTER YOU.
the GHOST IS RACHEL.
what?- I CALLED HER.
she CAME. I HEARD THE BELL.
I SAW THE BLOODY HANDS. I SAW WHAT JENNA AND ALLISON SAW,
but I'M STILL HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT.
you're GONNA BE DEAD IN 4 DAYS.
no. THAT'S HOW LONG RACHEL WAS IN A COMA BEFORE SHE DIED,
and THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT.
Rachel HAD A HEART CONDITION,
and THE EXCITEMENT OR THE FEAR OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT HAPPENED IN THAT BATHROOM,
it WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER BODY TO TAKE.
but I HEARD THE BELL.
no, WHAT YOU HEARD WAS HER HEART MONITOR.
she HAD A CONDITION, AND THE SCARE IS WHAT KILLED HER.
Oh, MY GOD.
that's WHY SHE DID IT.
that's WHY SHE DID WHAT?
that's WHY SHE CAME FOR US.
that's WHY SHE'S SAVING ME FOR LAST.
when ALLISON SAID SHE KNEW SOMEONE WHO'D SEEN BLOODY MARY,
I THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST LYING TO SCARE US,
so WHY NOT RETURN THE FAVOR?
right? BUT I FIGURED ALLISON OR JENNA WOULD TAKE THE DARE。。。
then IT WAS RACHEL.
she WAS SO QUIET.
you KNOW, I BARELY EVEN KNEW HER,
and THEN JUST OUT OF NOWHERE, SHE JUST STEPS UP.
OK, I'M BORED ALREADY. I'M GONNA GO TO BED.
whatever.
bloody MARY.
bloody MARY.
bloody MARY.
Allison AND JENNA DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'D DONE.
BUT。。。BUT I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT ANYONE.
Yeah, BUT RACHEL DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
so I DID THIS.
I KILLED HER.
it WAS AN ACCIDENT, AND I KNOW THAT,
but WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT RACHEL KNOWS THAT.
she NEEDS YOUR HELP TO MOVE ON.
you SAY THAT LIKE。。。
is SHE HERE?
no, BUT I THINK I KNOW WHERE SHE MIGHT BE.
where DID IT HAPPEN?
in THE HALL BATHROOM.
come ON.
I CAN'T.
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
and HOW YOU DIED.
please LET ME HELP YOU.
Rachel, STOP IT. STOP IT!
they KILLED ME.
you TOOK A DARE THAT WENT WRONG.
that's WHAT HAPPENED.
left FOR DEAD。。。
by YOU.
Sloane DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE GONNA TAKE THAT DARE.
none OF THEM DID. YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE THEM.
doesn't MATTER NOW.
they CALLED MY NAME.
your NAME IS RACHEL. YOU'RE NOT BLOODY MARY.
she WAS A DIFFERENT GIRL BURIED ALIVE BY HER PARENTS.
so WAS I.
wait. I DON'T SEE HER.
is SHE GONE? IS IT OVER?
not YET,
but I THINK I KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND HER.
I CAN'T FIND IT.
where IS IT?
your GRAVE'S NOT HERE, RACHEL.
this WAS NEVER YOUR HOME.
you HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO YOU REALLY ARE.
you HAVE TO REMEMBER HOW THIS ALL STARTED.
look AT YOUR HANDS.
you WERE HOLDING A GLASS, AND IT BROKE IN YOUR HAND.
your HEART STOPPED BECAUSE YOU WERE SCARED.
I COULDN'T BREATHE.
felt LIKE AN EMPTY, COLD BOX IN MY CHEST.
then I SAW HER, SLOANE。。。
saw HOW I SCARED HER,
how I SCARED THEM ALL.
and THAT FEAR THAT THEY FELT,
I KNEW THAT FEELING SO WELL.
and THEY LOOK AT ME NOW,
and THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE FROZEN IN FEAR.
you MEAN ALLISON AND JENNA.
I'm WITH THEM ALL THE TIME.
I CAN GO ANYWHERE, DO ANYTHING.
I NEVER HAVE TO REST,
and MY PARENTS, THEY CAN'T STOP ME ANYMORE.
so THAT'S WHY YOU UNDERSTOOD MARY.
you KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE BURIED ALIVE.
but SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY, YOU LOST WHO YOU REALLY ARE
and WHO YOU WERE TO EVERYBODY WHO REALLY LOVED YOU.
I CAN HELP YOU,
but YOU HAVE TO LET MARY GO.
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO ACCEPT.
I DON'T CARE IF YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN SEE SPIRITS OR UFOS.
I've HEARD ENOUGH.
tell HIM I DROVE HIS SNOWMOBILE INTO A TREE.
she WANTS YOU TO KNOW THAT SHE DROVE YOUR SNOWMOBILE INTO A TREE.
Oh, MY GOD.
she WAS ONLY 13.
what's SHE TALKING ABOUT?
there WAS A BLIZZARD.
dad SAID I COULDN'T GO OUTSIDE,
but MOM COULD TELL I WAS JUST DYING,
watching ALL THE SNOW PILE UP.
she MADE ME PROMISE NEVER TO TELL.
she LET ME DRIVE THE SNOWMOBILE AROUND THE YARD.
that WAS A BAD IDEA.
there WAS A SNOWSTORM。。。
I LET HER DRIVE YOUR SNOWMOBILE.
I THOUGHT SHE'D BE SITTING AND HER HEART WOULD BE SAFE.
this IS GONNA SOUND REALLY LAME,
but I THINK THAT WAS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE.
she WANTS TO THANK YOU FOR THAT DAY.
Oh, I SUPPOSE SHE'S GRATEFUL THAT WE LET HER LIVE IN THE DORM, TOO.
tell HIM SAFETY IS OVERRATED.
she SAID THAT SAFETY IS OVERRATED.
sometimes, IT'S BETTER TO LET THINGS GO,
no MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.
I LET GO OF RACHEL, AND LOOK WHAT I GOT.
tell HIM THAT HE GAVE ME THE BEST GIFT HE COULD EVER GIVE ME,
my FREEDOM.
she KNOWS YOU MISS HER,
but SHE WANTS YOU TO UNDERSTAND HOW HAPPY YOU MADE HER.
I。。。
I DIDN'T WANT HER HAPPY.
I WANTED HER ALIVE.
and I WAS, THANKS TO THEM.
she WAS ALIVE.
you GAVE THAT TO HER.
she's RIGHT.
listen TO RACHEL.
is SHE HERE?
this IS SLOANE.
she IS RACHEL'S CLASSMATE.
she LOOKS JUST AS SCARED AS I WAS.
is THAT HOW YOU WANT HER TO STAY?
she FORGIVES YOU.
do YOU SEE THIS?
this LIGHT, ARE YOU FEELING THIS?
no.
it's JUST FOR YOU.
what IS SHE SAYING?
she's SAYING SHE'S FREE NOW.
she's SAYING GOOD-BYE.
it's OK.
Hey.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.
are YOU HAPPY?
generally YES. WHY?
cause THOSE COMATOSE GIRLS HAVE NOW WOKEN UP ,BECAUSE OF YOU.
and RUBLOODYMARY. COM GETS 5 HITS A DAY,
mostly FROM ME.
and THE CRICKETS HAVE RETURNED TO MY CLASSROOM.
I'm DOING MY LECTURES FOR NOBODY, PRACTICALLY, OK,
and THE STARK, RAVING TERROR THAT HAD THIS TOWN IN ITS GRIPS IS NOW JUST GONE, ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.
I'm SO SORRY. I SHOULD'VE KNOWN HOW IT WOULD AFFECT YOU.
I WAS THINKING OF LETTING YOU SKATE ON THAT $138 YOU OWE ME,
but NOW I'VE CHANGED MY MIND,
so PAY UP.
sorry. NO CASH.
but YOU CAN TAKE YOUR PAYMENT IN KIND.
What？ SOMETHING FROM HERE? SOME OF THIS JUNK?
do I HAVE BLUE HAIR?
do LIVE AT THE END OF THE BLOCK WITH 15 CATS?
forget IT. YOU OWE ME $138.
this IS ME LEAVING DISGRUNTLED.
Hiya, JIM.
Hey.
what TIME IS OUR RESERVATION?
8：00，CAN WE GO?
you KNOW WHAT? I THINK MAYBE WE ARE.
Grandview welcomes home town hero SGT. Matt Murphy look at this.
the whole town wants to welcome him back, and he comes home in the middle of the night.
well, maybe he doesn't want all the attention.
Hey, the guy got the silver star. He should bask in the glory.
poor guy probably won't get a moment's peace.
I'm just glad my buddy is back safe.
you think he's gonna be different?
I think two tours in iraq would change anybody, but if he just takes it slow, gets used to being home, and doesn't come back to the firehouse until he's absolutely ready, he's gonna be fine.
Matty. - Hey, hey.
welcome home, man. - How are you, man?
let me take that for you.
we are so glad that you're back. - Oh, it's great to be back.
I swear, it's like I've never been away.
everything is just the same.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting, babe.
what's a few years between friends?
I'm back, baby. I'm yours.
Hey, matt murphy, is that you?
yo, it's matt murphy. How you doing, man?
I'm good, man. I'm good. How are you?
good to see you. Doing great. - Great to see you, too.
great to see you again. - All right, guys.
guys, there'll be time to elect him pope over the weekend, ok, but come to the party, if you can. Let's get out of here. Let's take him home.
see you. - Bye. Take it easy.
man, I'm sorry to tear you away from your friends.
were you worrying them, too?
Hey, come on. Give me a break.
Hey, let's go and get a beer, ok?
they want to go home. They don't want company.
did you hear that? - Yeah.
well, maybe it was just a car backfiring or something.
right.
so, your place tomorrow. What do you want us to bring?
Matt, what is this?
you all right?
hey...
wow, I--I guess I'm still a little jumpy.
it's ok. - Let's get you home, ok?
Yeah. We'll see you guys tomorrow. - Ok.
Yeah. Early, right? - Right, first thing.
good night. - Good night.
what just happened there?
haunting of some kind, a very noisy one, but no one should have heard that but me.
right. What does that mean?
I don't know, but I think matt brought the war home with him.
so, do you think matt is finally gonna ask gina to marry him?
I don't know, and please don't ask me to ask him.
I mean, she stuck it out with him for a long time now.
they both deserve a happy ending.
Yeah. Oh, listen to this.
this is from the citation matt got with his medals.
with his squad pinned down by an insurgent ambush, "murphy braved enemy fire to retrieve a humvee "and fought his way back to his patrol "before sustaining wounds that caused him to crash just 10 yards short of his troops, who were killed moments later by an I. E.D.
how do you get over something like that?
I can't imagine what that must be like.
you know, do you think that's what I heard last night, is part of the firefight?
did you say you thought that ghost was insurgent?
well, I don't really know. I mean, he was wearing a head scarf, but it was more the feeling I got from him, like anger and rage.
maybe revenge. - Maybe...
but that still doesn't explain why matt heard the same thing I did.
doesn't make any sense.
you know, maybe his ptsd is making this haunting different.
wait a minute. Who says he's got posttraumatic stress?
he kind of said it himself, didn't he?
no. He said he gets a little jumpy when he hears loud noises, but, I mean, let's not diagnose somebody just because he saw a ghost.
Hey, jim? - Yeah?
you know what? Never mind. Let's just get ready for a party.
Hey, you two. - Hi.
Hey, buddy. How's the arm? - Not bad.
Oh, we've got that food group covered.
well, at least we're not wearing the same outfit.
don't worry about it. We're gonna need it all.
I think matt has invited everyone he's ever met.
how's it going? - Good. Good.
yeah?
too beautiful. Made me nervous.
Hey, we don't have to do this, you know?
we could still take off, you and me, go to the beach or something.
any more sausage anywhere?!
and let clancy eat us out of house and home?
Hey, I heard that. - No way.
OK. Who's hungry?
who wants some of the best burgers
I'm so, so sorry. - It's ok, matt.
you know how much he loved you.
everyone, this is anna sanchez and her little girl sari.
Anna's husband hector was in my unit.
I was lucky as hell to serve with him.
he was lucky to serve with you.
come on. Come over here.
so, this is someone I want you to meet.
want to say hi, sari? - Oh, she's shy.
I learned how to do this when I was away with your daddy.
mi daddy, too. - Daddy. Yeah. Look. Look.
it could fly.
can you say thank you to matt, sari? - Thank you.
that's ok, sweetheart.
want to go play? Yeah?
OK, everyone. Listen up.
sweetheart, come here.
OK. Well, first, I want to thank gina for so many yearsof patience and patience and more patience.
can't imagine what you've been through, babe.
well, that's about to change.
this came yesterday. It's my discharge from the guard, so as of now, I'm officially free
no more tours, no more wars.
belong to all you people now.
that's great, matt.
um, I'm gonna go get that cake out of the fridge.
you know, I don't get it.
they've been dating each other half of their adult lives.
he's obviously crazy about her, and she's nuts about him.
I'm starting to wonder if it has something to do with the ghost that's haunting him.
wait. He's got a ghost?
is everybody haunted? - Could be, on both questions.
so, do you think it has something to do with the war?
I don't know. I think it might be an insurgent, which I'm trying to find out more about, but there's so much.
can't you just ask the ghost guy, or is there a language barrier?
does that even happen with ghosts?
never has been before, but I don't know because I can't even get close enough to this one.
you know what? Never mind. Sorry.
I am trying. I will listen to whatever you have to say, even if I can't, you know, wrap my mind around it.
Bye. - Bye.
look who I found in the square getting treated to free ice cream.
wow, the store looks great, mel. - Thanks. Yeah.
it's a bunch of new old stuff. Take a look.
I, uh--I guess strawberry is not the best flavor for me right now.
Hey, don't everyone freak out. It's ok to laugh about these things.
better than being bottled up, right?
Yeah. Hey, I was thinking about taking matt over to the firehouse, showing him the new toys.
why don't you guys go and talk, and gina can stay here with me. We'll catch up.
come on, man.
I was gonna save this for later, but the got about 12 new video games.
he's really happy to be back... at least, most of the time.
how about you? How are you doing?
it's hard.
I thought that when he came back, that we would
it's not like I had some big plan or anything.
it's just, I'm so ready to take this to the next level, you know?
and now is not exactly the time to have that conversation.
Yeah.
he has these bad dreams where he talks in his sleep, and he always says, "let me go.
does he ever tell you anything specific about what happened?
no.
you mean, when I lost my guys? - Uh, yeah.
people keep asking me that. You know what's strange?
I have no idea.
you mean, you just blacked it out?
I mean, I remember stuff up to a point, but after that, nothing, and part of me is scared to remember.
Hey, I'm sorry I even asked.
I mean, you don't have to talk about this if you don't want to.
we were on patrol, maybe 2 or 3 clicks south of baghdad, almost ready to pack it in.
market square had been car bombed a few days before, so it was deserted, so quiet.
it was weird. Then we started taking fire.
you ok? - Yeah. Yeah.
I just remembered that I need to run downstairs and check on something, so just make yourself at home, and I'll be right back.
OK.
we try to make it back to our humvee, but we were taking too much fire.
I called for air support, but air cav was 20 minutes out.
we took cover behind that bombed-out car, and that that's when all hell broke loose.
they were firing at us from everywhere. We were pinned down, an ambush.
it was chaos. Everyone was screaming and yelling.
we're taking enemy fire, and we had to get out of there.
that's all I remember,
I mean, except for this feeling, this feeling that I wanted to go.
I wanted them to let me go.
but, matt, getting in the humvee, going towards your men
I'm not saying I couldn't have done those things.
I just don't remember.
who are you?
incoming! Heads up!
Sarge, get back here.
sergeant murphy! Matt!
why can't you see me? - Where's that crazy bastard going?
listen to me. I can help you. - Kill that son of a bitch.
all right. Fall in.
stack on me. Let's go. Go, go, go.
give my love to melinda.
yo, where you been?
to a war, and I was right there in the middle of it.
you all right?
it gets worse, and you're not gonna like it.
what?
I think matt is being haunted by his own men.
this guy checks into a hotel. Every night that he's there, at 2 A. M. - There's a knock on the door. - Is this a joke?
well, if you laugh, yeah.
no, but every other guest that stays in this hotel has the exact same problem, so, to make a long story short, the people that run the hotel, they call in a bunch of, you know, paranormal experts and stuff, and what do you think they found?
a normal, rational, nonsupernatural explanation.
I love this role-reversal thing we're doing. It's great.
no. Of course not. They find the ghost of a room-service waiter who's bringing the same tray of food to the same room at the same time every single night, and then the groggy guest, well, he opens the door, but the ghost is gone, laughing hysterically.
fascinating , but what does a spirit who plays ding dong ditch have to do with the ghost of a bunch of american soldiers fighting the same battle over and over again?
everything. It's called an imprint haunting.
it's a ghost stuck in sort of a time loop.
they have to do the same thing over and over and over again.
Why? - Well, I don't know. It depends on the ghost.
in the case of the room-service waiter, he's probably still waiting for that tip he never got.
so, they fight the same battle over and over again, just hoping for a different outcome?
well, yeah, and in the case of your soldiers, maybe something happened to them over there that they can't accept, maybe like getting blown up. I'm not trying to be funny.
I mean, I know humor is the first casualty of war.
the quote is, "truth is the first casualty of war.
you're right. You're right. Truth is the first casualty of war.
it's amazing. It's like two heads, one brain.
you said the ghosts were angry at their sergeant, - your friend the hero. - Yes, very.
OK. Well, if truth is the first casualty of war, maybe something happened with the way that they died that made them follow that sergeant home.
like the truth about how they died. - Or why they died.
anyway, I'm sure whatever information you get will be a lot more informative than this investigation they have going.
what investigation? - I'm sorry. I assumed that you knew.
why has the family of one of grandview's slain soldiers "petitioned the pentagon for an investigation into the incident? Stay tuned.
this is hector? - Yes.
he's the one next to matt--rocky.
and what are all these nicknames?
money is money because he never loses a game at poker, like, ever.
lucky picked up that name because he only lost two fingers in a roadside bombing during his last rotation.
and hector? Why rocky?
because they used to kid him that he'd done more tours in iraq than there were "rocky" sequels, which was funny until-- you know.
I'm sorry if I came at a bad time.
it's all right. I just have class at 4: 00.
it's the only thing keeping me sane right now.
I don't want to keep you, but I just want to ask you
do you know where
Melinda, this is richard, hector's father.
Oh, hi. - Hi.
Melinda is a friend of matt'S.
Oh.
do you know where the county tax stuff for last year is?
above the file cabinet out back.
thank you.
he came down from boston to stay with me and help out.
he's going through all the finances.
I was doing it, but
I started finding all these notes that hector wrote to himself, you know, all the plans he had for us.
this must be so hard for you. - Not just for me.
I don't want you to think that I'm prying, but I did hear that one of the families has asked for an investigation.
richard asked for it.
do you know why?
like I said, it's not just me that's having a hard time.
Richard, he's angry. He wants reasons.
don't you?
reasons aren't gonna bring my husband back.
do you think he would mind if I talked to him about why he's doing this?
Why? - I don't know...
just in case I can help in some way.
he's out back.
you don't really understand what's going on here, do you?
do you have something against matt?
Yeah, just the death of my son, that's all.
I don't understand. Did matt somehow
look. If you know this guy, you shouldn't be talking to me.
it's all gonna come out soon enough.
what's gonna come out?
you think you know murphy? - Yes, and so does my husband.
come and take a look at the real sergeant murphy.
what is this? -Terrorist web site, a jihadi recruitment tool.
they post videos of american soldiers being killed.
Oh, that is awful.
I was a colonel in the gulf war.
I still have friends in the nsa.
buddy of mine sent me this link.
government doesn't want this to get out.
there, the one trying to stop sergeant murphy, that's my son.
what's going on? - Hard to say.
sergeant murphy seems to be in some kind of argument with his men.
that's my boy who's keeping him from getting up.
Why? - Keep watching.
Sarge! Stop him! Stop him! Where's that crazy bastard going?
he makes it to the humvee, and he doesn't even wait for his men.
he abandoned his men under fire, and he left my son to die.
come on. Stack on me. Let's go. Go, go, go.
I sat here and watched my son die a hundred times, and murphy gets a medal.
what are you planning to do with this?
people who gave murphy his silver star don't want to see this.
tomorrow I'm giving it to the press.
you will ruin matt's life. - He has his life!
couldn't there be an explanation of what happened on the video?
such as? - Well, I don't know...but, you know, maybe if you gave me some more time, I could figure out what really happened.
from who--the military, murphy?
who's gonna tell the truth? - I am begging.
please give matt some more time.
maybe his memory will come back, and you're gonna lose nothing by waiting.
I'll hold off another day.
you should use that time to let murphy know what's coming down.
that'll jog his memory.
Hey, man, you home?
Matt. Gina? Anybody home?
Hey, buddy, I thought we'd play some ball.
since you only got one good arm, maybe I stand a chance this time, huh?
Matt. Matt, where are you, man?
Matt... - close the door. Close the damn door.
Matt, the door is closed. What a yreou doing?
lock the door. Lock the door.
the doors are closed, ok? Take easy
lock the door. Lock the door.
come on. Tell me what's wrong.
Matt, put the gun down. Put the gun down.
it's ok. Good.
I'm just gonna take it. I'm gonna take the gun from you, that's all.
easy.
get away from my
buddy, you're having a panic attack. Take it easy.
breathe. Breathe. Try and calm down.
Matt, nobody is gonna hurt you.
I lied! I lied! - Lied about what?
when I got off the bus and told you it was like I was never away.
I feel like I never left iraq.
I can't come home, no matter how hard I try.
you are home now. You have people who care about you, people who love you.
no one is gonna let anything happen to you.
come on. You're safe now.
I was so scared.
I've never been scared, not like this.
I keep seeing them, jim--my men.
it's like theyree he'R.
they know it should be me that's d d, eaand not them.
they're coming to get me.
guy is in trouble, mel. I don't know how much more he can take, and if this is all because of those ghosts, you got to make them disappear, I mean, like, now.
you know it's not that simple. - Why not?
why does it have to be about what happened that night?
because the haunting is just a symptom, and you know that, too.
there's always something underneath it. I wish there wasn't, but there is.
I know this guy through and through. He saved my life on the job.
I mean, the man is a hero.
OK, so what are you afraid of?
whatever we find out about matt, you're still his friend.
we're his friends, so we'll help him.
well, how you gonna help him?
I think matt is feeling the hauntings because he's so bonded to his men.
they get to a point where they can experience each other's feelings, even death, and every time that he tries to remember what happened, the ghosts come, just not clearly enough for me to reach them.
all right, so he has to remember better for them to pass through.
he has to remember everything, even if it triggers another attack.
I have to reach them in order to cross them over.
OK. Well, how do you make him remember?
I have to show him something.
come on. Stack on me. Let's go.
go, go, go.
do you remember any of it?
at least now I know why I keep hearing myself saying, "let me go.
no. No. There has to be some other explanation for this.
my guys are dead. I mean, you saw what happened.
I ran. I abandoned my men under fire.
I'm alive. What other explanation could there be?
Matt, hector's father is gonna go to the press with this tomorrow.
you need to remember more.
it should've been me.
Ow! Kill that son of a bitch.
Hector, I need to talk to you. I can help you.
your wife told me that's what everyone calls you.
Anna told me. - Anna?
Yeah. Matt wants you to know how sorry he is.
he wishes that he could take back what he did, but he can't change what happened, and neither can you.
you don't belong here. You all need to cross over.
he said I'd know what to do. - Who? Who said that?
gonna kill that son of a bitch.
what are you looking for? - He said I'd know what to do.
no. Wait. - All right. Fall in.
stack on me. All right. Go, go, go.
moving.
mommy is almost finished, ok, sweetie? Then it's me-and-you time.
Yeah.
Hector? - Daddy.
that sounded just like the way your daddy would bang through the door.
used to drive me crazy.
dada.
Oh, baby girl, I know. I miss daddy, too.
when I get done with my homework, we'll got to the park and do what you want, ok, sweetie?
daddy.
dada. - You stay here, sweetie.
dad, is that you?
dad?
Hi, anna. I'm so sorry to bother you, but could I talk to you for a second?
sure. Come in.
everything ok? - Yeah.
daddy. - Sari? Sari?
daddy. - Baby.
come on, sweetie.
come here, baby. Come here.
what are you looking for? We don't have much time.
he gave it to me.
he said I'd know what to do. - What is it?
it's an envelope. - What's in it?
I never got to open it.
go, go, go.
what the hell is going on? Who were you talking to?
OK. Just please trust me that I will explain everything.
there's something I have to find. - What?
I don't know exactly, but I needoko lo t at anything of hector's that was sent back from iraq.
Why? - Please.
I gave the box to hector's father. I don't know where he put it.
Jim? - Gina called me 5 minutes ago.
she said matt is a mess. I'm on my way over there right now.
Yeah. I'll meet you.
Where's matt? - He left.
I tried to get him to talk to me, to tell me how he was feeling, - to tell me anything. - Gina, where'd he go? Do you know?
I don't know. He kept talking about that video.
he hated that you guys saw it.
he said that now you would know that he was a coward, too, and so would everybody else as soon as it was made public.
he's not a coward. - We know that, gina.
we're gonna find him. He's gonna be ok.
I'm afraid that-- - what?
after he left, I went to check for this gun. It's gone.
I got him.
I need your help.
the video is going out. I kept my word. Now it's time.
it has nothing to do with the video.
I think your son may have been carrying something when he died that was given to him by matt.
so what? - I need to find out what it is because matt's life depends on it.
what the hell are you talking about?
show her, dad. Let her look through my things.
Hector would want it. Please trust me.
since when do you speak for my son?
now, everything they sent me of his is locked up out back in storage room.
Anna is not ready to look through it.
you know, is anna home? Because maybe we
Anna took sari to the store. She was a nervous wreck when I got home.
I want you to stay away from her.
Hey! Hey!
are you nuts? Do I have to call the cops?
it's hot.
how is that possible?
please trust me when I say this.
I think your son wants you to find what matt gave to him.
this is all I have left of my son.
I said that anna wasn't ready to look through it.
it's really me who isn'T.
I keep thinking that if I don't open the box, it's like it's not really final.
I won't see the end of my son.
I am so sorry.
my jacket
my right vest pocket.
maybe you should check his jacket-- right vest pocket.
I wasn't afraid, dad. I know I wasn'T.
told me how to be tough, and I was.
you should know he wasn't afraid.
he was tough, just like you taught him to be.
I don't understand any of this.
until I get home!
is this what you're looking for?
what does this all mean?
Matt. He needs us right now. - Where?
where the names are in the village square.
can I keep this?
yeah
come on. You remember when you were a rookie.
you were as green as this grass here, but you plucked me off that fire escape without a second thought. You saved me, and that wall came crashing down. I remember, you didn't even blink.
I don't know who that guy was, but it wasn't me.
it wasn't the guy who let his patrol die in some bombed-out square in iraq.
you saw ityo . U know.
I don't care what I saw or what I didn't see on that videotape.
I know who you are.
this whole town knows who you are.
nice try, pal.
I appreciate it. I really do.
this isn't about who I am.
it's about what I am.
Matt, what are you doing here?
what do you want?
you know what I want, jim?
I want to know why I left my men behind.
I want to know why I can't remember what I did and why I keep doing this.
most of all,
I want to know why they're dead and I'm not.
Matt, I went to hector's house. We found this.
you gave it to him right before you got in the humvee.
what does it mean?
you know, these reeds grow everywhere in the south of baghdad.
one day, I was just playing with them, and I made this.
that's a ring? - An engagement ring.
it was supposed to be a placeholder till I could get her a real one.
why'd you give it to hector?
because he thought he was one a one-way trip in the humvee.
you thought you weren't coming home.
that day that you got in the humvee, you weren't running scared, were you?
you were on a suicide mission for your men.
how'd you know that?
your men, they're here with you, with us right now.
Why?
because we don't leave a man behind, especially when he never left us.
they said you never left them.
what happened?
we got separated from our convoy, pinned down in that square.
he radioed for air cover. There just wasn't enough time.
get down! get down!
Where's the fire coming from? - Storefront across the street, sarge.
we got another one, 11 o'clock.
rocky, the gun nest behind that wall-- 2, maybe 3 shooters.
can't move. What are we gonna do?
what are you doing, man?
you'll know what to do. - What?
Sarge. Matt, get down, man.
stop it! - Let me go!
someone stop him!
kept trying to pull you back. You just kept saying,"let me go.
I remember.
I couldn't take the time to explain it because if I did
we wouldn't have let you go.
stop murphy! What's that crazy bastard doing? - Matt!
I knew they were confused.
all I could do was say a prayer that I'd make it to the humvee without getting killed.
Sarge!
he drove straight into enemy fire. He was sacrificing himself to save us.
two jihadis left. I got the first one.
then my gun just jammed.
that's why you keep breaking it down and putting it back together again.
Yousre ju't trying to unjam it.
fall in. Stack on me. Let's go. Let's get sarge. Go, go, go.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that was it.
my ticket was about to be punched by the last gunman.
and then hector took out the last shooter.
you know, we came to save him.
they were coming to rescue you.
No!!!
but they never made it. Couldn't accept it.
it was like a part of my brain just shut down.
should've left me.
it should've been 4 survivors and 1 casualty instead of the other way round.
he saved us.
there was no way we were leaving without him.
the rest of it? Nobody had any control over what happened next.
I would've done anything for them, anything.
I'd trade places with them in a heartbeat.
you tell matt that he's alive for a reason and that he shouldn't waste it feeling guilty about us.
everything that happened was meant to happen.
Hector wants you to stop blaming yourself.
you did everything you could. Everything happens for a reason.
whoa, that's bright. Is that a chopper?
no. No. That's not a searchlight.
it's beautiful.
what does it mean?
it means you're ready to go.
tell anna I love her.
tell her not to let my little girl forget about her dad.
I will.
talk to my father.
ask him if he thinks matt didn't try to save us, then why are there bullet holes in the front grill of our humvee?
it's because matt was going towards the bullets, not away from them.
you tell him that I want him to watch out for matt now the way matt watched out for me.
he's the one that's gonna need help now.
what's happening?
they did what they came here to do.
they said good-bye.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
sorry.
don't ever leave me again.
what part of "I love you" don't you get?
I'm with you. - I know.
this is all I can give you right now.
now, we'll replace it when we
don't you dare.
Oh, it's just so sad.
I know, it's killin' me.
sorry, but the movie really gets to me.
after the eighth time?
Yes, after the eighth time.
I don't even know why I'm crying over a movie.
I should be crying over about overwhelmed I am at the store right now.
Uh-huh. You need more help?
besides Delia? No way.
no, she's just...
preoccupied.
getting Ned into that private school proved to be a full-time job.
right, at the busiest time of your year.
pretty much. Yeah.
but the leaves have stopped changing, so soon, the tourists will go home.
look, you need to take a break now, so hear me out, ok?
all right? My mother is gonna have another one of her procedures.
ha ha. Tuck or lift?
I don't ask.
but, look, she's gonna be in the recovery center for at least a few days.
you and I can use her apartment in the city.
sounds great.
good.
ghost in the house?
woman: Hi, um, are you ok?
no, just a drunk guy.
Hey, somebody get some water, please.
call 9-1-1, please.
are you all right, there?
my name's Jim, you feeling anything?
I'm sorry, Jim.
Oh, it's all right.
do you feel anything here?
all right, good.
but we really need an ambulance.
he needs to know...
I'll always be with him.
you're worried about him?
I can help you talk to him.
can you give him one of those?
then he'd know.
Yeah, I could do that.
what's your name?
God, what an idiot I am.
the entire Rockland U. Rugby team, and I pass out on their table like a drunken fool.
it's all right.
the good news is, you can hide in here until your cab comes.
Thanks.
I owe you.
water?
no, thank you.
but if you ever need a lawyer, I'm your
that's a pretty serious sedative.
you're taking these tonight?
Yeah, I've been, uh, I've been going through a rough patch.
Rougenh ough to want to kill yourself?
because you mix these with alcohol, that's what's going to happen.
I know.
just lately, I, uh
what?
huh, feel like I'm going crazy.
like, uh...
well, ha ha, like I'm being watched, and that's nuts, and this--this makes it better.
Yeah, maybe you need to get some different help.
I actually might know someone who
right, you're right. You know what, thank you, and tomorrow I'm gonna
this is for you.
who? Who told you to do that?
Colleen, but she's...
holy...
that woman was my worst nightmare.
this can't be happening.
because that girl, she died, so, um, how could you talk to her?
just take a minute.
sober up before you have any conversations
if she wasn't your girlfriend, then who was she?
Oh, we, uh...
we went out a couple times.
she was an intern at my firm for about 2 years.
she was cute, smart, but...oh, god, this...
this is messed up.
Yeah, it is.
you see, everybody thought she was so great, you know?
but when we went out, I saw something, you know?
she was--she was...off.
and she fell for you?
I don't know exactly what happened, but when I didn't ask her out anymore, she, uh, she flipped.
just became...
obsessed with me.
how, like stalker obsessed?
Yeah.
I mean, pretty much.
[Yawns] Look who's still up studying the...
5 classifications of stalkers.
a little light night reading.
it's a real Grimm's fairy tale.
it starts off creepy and then goes to terrifying.
what are you still doing up?
I was getting a little lonely waiting for you to come to bed.
I'm sorry. I just couldn't stop thinking about that poor guy.
that's all right.
I'll substitute food for love.
you want a P. B. And J?
no, thanks.
Hey, did you know that most stalkers actually believe they're in a relationship with the person they're stalking?
wait, so Colleen really thinks Shane is her boyfriend?
Yeah, and they're usually mentally ill.
but Colleen, she has this kind of...tic.
huh, you know, that makes me wonder, because, uh, sometimes muscle twitches or tics can be a side effect of anti-psychotic drugs.
that's interesting, but I think she is more of an intimacy seeker.
wants to be loved by her victim.
usually sending flowers, love notes, rarely violent.
so you think, uh, Shane doesn't have to worry about bringing in the pet rabbit just yet?
no, the fatal attraction stalker is actually called the predatory stalker.
they like to isolate or control their victims.
hmm. Well, pretty much any stalker ghost would be creepy to me, so I could kind of understand Shane was on a bender.
you know， in some twisted way, Colleen actually believes she cares about Shane, which means I have to convince her that the best thing for him is for her to move on.
well, if she really is a stalker, you know where to find her.
and, uh, you know where to find me.
I know you are not about to take that peanut butter up into my bed.
uh, no, no.
I was gonna take this peanut butter up into my bed.
stop it!
every monday...
an orange rose.
don't forget.
Colleen, I think you've got it wrong.
you're confused.
Shane is not your boyfriend.
you have to send them every monday.
you know, the best thing that you could do for Shane is to go into the light. No.
he needs to know how I felt.
well, I admit the night is pretty fuzzy, in fact, I'd kinda chalked it all up to being a drunken idiot, but I guess that's wishful thinking, isn't it?
I'm just gonna cut right to the chase.
I see spirits, earthbound spirits, and I've seen Colleen.
so...
you're telling me you see ghosts?
I know that it's hard to believe.
this is wild, but, um...
well, I kinda knew it.
Yeah, don't ask me how
hold on, wait, is she here right now?
no. No, she was downstairs.
like the phone and the door?
wow, ok.
huh. At first I was little bit relieved, but now I'm kind of freaking out.
you see, Colleen, she was crazy.
OK, I don't think she wants to hurt you.
if that helps you at all.
Um...she just needs to cross over into the light, and I can help her do that.
OK...
uh, what I do until then?
once I get her to trust me,
I might need you to talk to her.
no, see, I don't-- I don't want to talk to her.
she's warped.
no, she had this big fantasy of us together.
couldn't let it go.
she'd make up these insane stories, like trips we had supposedly been on, romantic dinners, even arguments we'd never had.
did you ever feel threatened?
well, it never quite got to where she was leaving dead rats on my doorstep, but, yeah, she was
you know, she was sick, mentally
Hey, my lunch canceled, do you want to--oh.
excuse me. I see you've already made other plans.
uh, no, no, no, this is Melinda Gordon.
I met Melinda and her husband last night.
Oh, ha.
my mistake.
just when I see a pretty woman in Shane's office,
he's our resident heartbreaker.
so I've heard.
uh, we had a mutual friend--Colleen.
Oh, right, pretty intern.
she was very nice, very nice.
she had quite a thing for shane.
wasn't she the one that quit because he couldn't date interns?
you're romanticizing again.
she actually--I think she just found a better gig.
it was a pleasure meeting you.
nice to meet you.
OK, that was completely embarrassing.
the fact is, I rarely go out.
I'm up for partner, so I pretty much live here.
do you know how Colleen died?
I heard it was some kind of accident, but I'm not really sure.
well, what about friends?
family, an address, anything, even a last name?
but that really is pretty much all I've got.
I mean, I can check to see if the firm kept any records on her.
OK. Well, if you come up with anything, um, please call me.
definitely.
look...
whatever's going on here, I really need it to stop.
promise.
Melinda: Hey, what a nice surprise.
hi there.
somebody call for a handyman?
I thought I'd check that circuit problem, being that, uh, Delia might be minding the store on her own this weekend.
that's right, your mom goes into surgery on friday.
tell me I can live in hope and tell her to leave us the keys to her apartment, right?
it's doable. It would just be more doable if I could talk to someone who knew Colleen.
didn't you say she was an intern?
have you checked all the law firms in the area?
Yeah, that and every florist within a 10 mile radius.
I mean, she obviously paid cash for those flowers 'cause there was no record of her. I really am stumped.
I've pretty much used up my quote of favors at the police station looking for your dad.
Yeah, I know, but Colleen has got to be on a police radar somehow.
I mean, she was stalking someone, so...ask.
I mean, if it, you know, means a weekend away, like this one.
it does. I promise.
Oh, hey, battery?
Yep. Ok.
talk to you later.
Bye.
gotta run.
it's paid to the end of the month.
how'd you know it'd be vacant?
I knew Colleen.
maybe you'd know how to get in touch with her family, then?
no one has come for her stuff.
actually, I was hoping you knew them.
I'd like to talk to them, too.
well, it's weird,that whole who to contact section of her lease was blank.
so you think maybe she didn't have any family?
seems that way.
she'd only been here a couple of months.
kept to herself.
wouldn't even take the elevator, afraid she might have to ride with someone.
turns out, it would have been safer.
what do you mean?
she fell down the stairway.
didn't you know?
and broke her neck?
Yeah, that's how she died.
you're not really here for a rental, are you?
no.
actually, I'm here to understand more about Colleen's death.
do you mind if I just take a moment, alone?
I got ya.
no problem.
Thanks.
Colleen: He needs to know...
how I felt.
he was stalking you, wasn't he?
Colleen, you don't have to do this anymore.
OK? He can't hurt you.
you're safe now.
there is no safe place.
Yes, there is.
in the light. I can help you.
no.
he's everywhere.
you'll see.
[Reading] "You are my desiny. Love, Shane.
thank you. ok
Oh, my god.
Colleen, look, I know how upset you must be, and how angry.
I'm gonna ruin his life.
I know that what he did was awful,: and that you want revenge, but you were meant to move on, to move past this.
well, everything that you're doing, hiding in the shadows and...following people, that's him, not you.
do you remember where you died?
I remember running.
I don't know. That's ok.
I'm sure you had friends, family, or someone we could talk to.
no.
he made them all go away.
just Campbell.
Campbell never left me.
who is that?
is that your boyfriend?
give me a minute, will you?
this creep isn't stalking you now, is he?
no, he's not.
I just know that he really tormented Colleen and you were the detective on the case, right?
I didn't know anything about stalking, but this guy made me an expert.
so why isn't he in jail?
he's a lawyer.
knows his way around anti-stalking laws.
and he's smart.
he'll go right up to the line, but he won't cross it.
he seems like such a solid guy.
you know, he's on the fast track at his job,
I mean, everyone likes him.
a lot of these guys have high power careers.
but a real relationship would get in the way of their work.
so they create an imaginary one that they can control.
Oh, I think Shane Carson really believes he was Colleen's prince charming, you know?
see, Carson is what you call a sociopathic predator.
he isolated her, pushed away everyone so that he would be the only one she had left.
then how could some creep make all of her friends leave?
by making it so that she wasn't worth the trouble of knowing.
he'd harass these people like you wouldn't believe.
he'd make up lies, manipulate them, you name it.
he wanted her all to himself.
do you think he had anything to do with her death?
it was my first thought.
but we went through all the evidence.
I couldn't tie him to it.
I can't tell you what it feels like to be a cop, and you can't help someone.
I just wanted to see the light in her eyes again.
and you keep trying, and I know that meant a lot to her.
I'm not gonna rest until this son of a bitch is where he belongs.
be careful.
is that all you got?
I really loved you, Colleen.
we were good together.
Oh, but you never did appreciate all of the things I did for you.
even when you cheated on me...
I forgave you.
like with that C. P.A. You remember him?
I knew he wasn't right for you, but I let it play out.
you hacked into his client's records.
you know, I never told you this, but...
I was there that night you broke up.
Yeah, ha ha,
I saw how that creep left you standing alone outside that restaurant.
you canceled his credit card.
the waiter wouldn't let him leave.
and who was there for you through your tears?
no, you, uh...
you broke my heart, Colleen.
but you'll never hurt me again.
you're alone!
and desperate!
it's over.
losing your mind!
we're through.
No!
I really think you need to move on, Colleen.
I have.
she needs me.
were you there when she said that?
didn't hit me till later what she meant.
love's funny that way.
no, she asked me to call her, but I don't know.
it's always a delicate thing when someone's...
discovering their feelings.
Oh, she might appreciate something more personal.
Yes, thank youI and I was wondering if our pd attrition never faxed over those medical forms that
bringing you...
this.
look, I know who you are.
and what you did to Colleen.
Hey, look, I understand how you feel. Ok, I do.
you've only heard her side of it.
of course you think I'm a bad guy.
but I'm not.
and you know that.
deep down.
we need just to sort all this out.
Yeah, not even an hour away.
Shane, I'm married.
to a guy who has lots of cop buddies.
look...
I'm sorry Colleen mislead you, ok?
but she mislead me, too.
I know you want to hear me out.
Shane, I am onto you.
OK? This is not going to work with me.
Melinda? Are you ok?
I think it's time for you to leave.
and don't bring her into this.
Oops, is this a-- is this--is this a bad time?
Yeah, it looks like it is.
we want you to stay the hell away from me.
Oh, got it.
can't talk now.
OK, well, cool.
I'll be back later.
Oh, and a real friend...
a real friend doesn't tell someone whom they can and can't be with.
it's happening again.
no, it's not.
he--he can't hurt you.
but he can hurt you.
Delia: Melinda, are you there?
Delia? What's wrong?
I was driving home, and I got a phone call from the academy.
they told me that Ned's school counselor called to inquire about special resources, like psychotherapy, remedial studies, for Ned! Shane.
of course.
this is how he works, he's trying to push you away from me.
well, now it looks like I lied on Ned's application, and they will never let him in!
Colleen: It's started.
what has?
till there is no safe place.
I need to know if there's any way I can stop this guy.
he's stalking you now, isn't he?
Yeah, I think so, and I don't want to end up like Colleen, so I need you to do something to trip him up.
Carson probably latched onto you 'cause you're one of Colleen's friends.
you know, you gotta consider that everybody in your life may be at risk right now.
Yeah, he already tried some stunt with my friend Delia.
how is he getting this information?
he's annoyingly charming.
and he's gotta know his way around computers.
I mean, to do the things he did, you'd need access to socials, uh, passwords, mother's maiden names
Yeah, but it's illegal.
Yeah, only I'd need a subpoena to get the computer to prove he did it, and for that, I'd need evidence of wrongdoing.
Plus, he works for a law firm.
exactly.
our only hope to nail this guy is to get a hold of those records.
and so far, Shane's been way too careful to let that happen.
so other than that, there's absolutely nothing I can do to defend myself against Shane?
why do you think I hate him so much?
Hello?
you know, I tried calling you, but my phone wasn't working.
Wow. You really went all out.
get the hell out of here!
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
my husband is going to be home any second now!
what does that mean?
that surgical procedure his mother had to go in for, ha ha, some kind of complication.
Yeah, he had to rush down there.
Hello?
Anybody--hi.
Hey, I'm here to see my mom,
willows medical spa, please hold.
Oh, this can't be happening!
Yeah, she checked in a couple days ago.
she is...
hmm. Looks like she checked out already.
wait a minute, there's
there's gotta be some kind of mistake.
her doctor called me, Dr. Litvack.
told me there was some kind of complications, told me to come down.
can you--can you check one more time?
Clancy. Yeah, says right here Dr. Litvack released her at 11: 00 this morning?
you sure?
I'm sorry. You should have called first.
Yeah, right.
my cell phone's dead.
the service is cut out for...some reason.
Shane, you son of a
Hey. I'm really, really sorry about this, it's an emergency.
sorry.
Colleen: He's here.
Yeah, I know, he's in my front yard.
he's going around back.
OK, please remember if he pushed you down the stairs.
I can't.
can you tell me where he is now?
I don't see him.
What?!
he's gotta be out there!
maybe he's gone.
Oh, no!
where is he? Where is he?
he's outside, out the window!
Jim: Hey!
he's gone. He's gone. He jumped the fence.
I saw a car, but I couldn't get a plate.
I'm gonna call the cops.
no.
he cut the phone lines.
bastard.
honey...
it's ok.
I'm gonna go next door and call the cops.
I'm right there, I'm right there.
I thought I could stop him.
he'll take your life now, too.
no, that's not ever going to happen.
I was wrong, and you were right.
it is time for you to get your payback.
what do you mean?
we're gonna nail Shane.
we're gonna make sure he can never do anything like this again.
how?
OK, Shane was careful.
but...there's gotta be something he thought no one would ever see...
except a ghost.
I need you to tell me everything you've seen since you've been stalking him.
he really had files on everyone in your life?
pretty much.
from my apartment manager to detective Campbell.
where does he keep the files?
on his computer.
he was looking at one when I was there.
he...
he was checking detective Campbell's file.
so he's probably keeping everyone's personal information in those files, like socials, I. D. Numbers.
did you see anything like that?
I think there were numbers.
I just remember thinking how strange it was.
he had the date when David...
detective Campbell started smoking again.
it's funny.
I remember that, too.
I gave him such greif about it, but now...
I wish I hadn't.
sounds like detective Campbell meant a lot to you.
he was the one person Shane couldn't push away.
he was too strong.
he made me feel safe.
you think we really can stop him?
or are you just trying to get me into the light?
a little of both.
remember, Shane's in court on the Bergman case all morning.
assistant's name is Francis.
she thinks you're seeing Shane.
that's how he explained your last visit.
OK.
that could actually help us.
Oh, Francis, nice to see you again.
Yes. Melinda, right?
right. Um, I know that this is gonna sound silly,'cause, well, Shane is in court, but, um, he worked really late last night, and I think I left something behind.
Oh. I'll just go in.
Ooh, it's awkward.
and I know that Shane and I would appreciate it if I could just go in and get it myself, seeing as how...
I know what I left behind.
right. Go ahead.
thank you.
not that one.
it's on his personal laptop.
Nope. Ha ha.
OK, which one of these is gonna get me into the program?
the first one.
the other one gets you into the file.
OK.
that's it.
she's coming!
What?!
so embarrassing.
he must have moved it.
what's that?
wait a minute...
that's my shoe.
that's me.
Colleen: Oh, god.
these are all of me.
is there any way you guys were wrong, could Shane have pushed her down those stairs?
no.
there was a security surveillance tape.
Colleen was alone in the stairwell when she tripped.
it was an accident.
and I checked out Carson's alibi, it was solid.
then how did Shane take those photos?
maybe he didn't.
you should see something.
got it from the cop on Colleen's case.
it's a little gruesome, isn't it?
I'm just wondering how you got it, and why you would hang it in your office.
I'm gonna have my hands full with you.
I'm a lawyer.
I have friends in law enforcement.
you framed a photos of Colleen's dead body.
that's a little strange, don't you think?
it's my way of remembering her.
tell him how happy that makes me.
Colleen is happy that you want to remember her.
well, I hope it brings her some peace.
it does.
especially now that everyone's going to remember me.
it does.
she's especially happy now that she knows the whole firm will have something to remember her by.
we sent copies to all the partners, along with a note explaining the artwork in your office.
we also made a disk of all the files you kept on Colleen.
we sent emails to your clients, but that part was just for fun.
you hacked my computer?
imagine that.
Yeah, they have a paper trail showing how you destroyed colleen's life and everything that you did to her.
news flash, Nancy Drew!
you're just some nut I talked to once, and now you're all over me.
these things you're accusing me of?
no one cares.
Yes, they do.
because you're a lawyer, remember?
and you broke the law.
she had 10 restraining orders against you.
you stalked her, you harassed her, you stole her life long before she ever fell down those stairs, and your chances of making partner right now, by the way, zero.
he's sweating.
don't stop.
you're a pariah now.
now you have everything that you wished for Colleen
no friends, no fans, and if there's justice, no job. It's over.
if you wanted to break up, you
you should have said something.
we just did.
so, I think we're gonna get him on identity theft, of all things.
off the files I gave you?
not exactly.
and I don't even wanna know where you got those.
the photographs, along with Colleen's police reports gave us enough to seize the laptop.
I only wish she was here to see it.
I think she knows.
anyway, I, uh.
appreciate all you did.
this is enough to put Carson away, and he won't be practicing law anymore, so his life's pretty much over.
feels really good to finally get this guy.
so thanks.
no.
I may never see him again, I need to tell him...
um, detective...
yes?
uh, you should just know how much you meant to her.
what do you mean?
she wasn't as alone as you thought she was.
she had you.
and you never stopped caring about her.
something tells me that, uh, that wasn't because of your job.
that obvious, huh?
remind him of the time he walked me home from the station.
he was telling me about his first arrest when he was a rookie.
do you remember the night that you walked her home?
you were telling her about your first arrest.
she told you that?
it was just a purse snatcher.
I chased him into this lake and collared him about chest-deep in water.
and for 2 weeks after that, you had flippers in your locker and wet wings on your desk. [Laughs]
she laughed so hard.
I hadn't seen her smile like that in a long time.
I just remember wanting to freeze that moment.
and then you got to her house?
I was standing so close...
and I just remember this
a strand of her hair fell on my face.
I just didn't want to move.
I just wanted to kiss her so bad.
took everything I had not to.
she trusted me, so...
I couldn't.
did Colleen really tell you all that?
Yeah.
she also told me that she wished you had kissed her.
ahem, well...
Hey, wait.
what just happened?
well, believe it or not...
Hey, what's up? I thought you had the day off.
I just wanted to drop by and tell you the good news.
Ned's application got accepted at the academy.
so how did you undo all the damage that shane caused?
it wasn't easy, but we had his real school counselor call and just tell them it was a prank.
I am so sorry that you got caught up in all this.
what happened to that creep?
well, he got fired from his job, the county is pressing charges, he's out on bail, my guess is he's somewhere laying low, and Jim is walking me home from work every night.
that is so crazy.
well, I will see you tomorrow.
I have more errands to run.
you know what, I didn't bring those sconces up, because that basement is dead to me.
all those lights just shorted out again.
OK. Bye.
Bye.
Jim just fixed that!
Yeah, I'm looking for it right now.
Ugh, I'll call you back, Delia.
Shane: Miss me?
this is my husband.
like I care.
Jim: Melinda, you're not gonna believe this, but
Shane's dead, right?
Yeah, ODed. Pills, booze.
we just got the call. How did you know?
because he's right here.
Mel, get away from him, now!
this worked out the best all around.
don't you think?
now we can be together.
Oh, it's just so sad.
I know, it's killin' me.
sorry, but the movie really gets to me.
after the eighth time?
Yes, after the eighth time.
I don't even know why I'm crying over a movie.
I should be crying over about overwhelmed I am at the store right now.
you need more help?
besides Delia? No way.
no, she's just...preoccupied.
getting Ned into that private school proved to be a full-time job.
right, at the busiest time of your year.
pretty much. Yeah.
but the leaves have stopped changing, so soon, the tourists will go home.
look, you need to take a break now, so hear me out, ok?
my mother is gonna have another one of her procedures.
ha ha.
tuck or lift?
I don't ask.
but, look, she's gonna be in the recovery center for at least a few days.
you and I can use her apartment in the city.
sounds great.
good.
ghost in the house? -Hi, um, are you ok?
no, just a drunk guy.
Hey, somebody get some water, please.
call 9-1-1, please.
are you all right, there?
my name's Jim, you feeling anything?
I'm sorry, Jim.
Oh, it's all right. Put your hand down.
do you feel anything here?
all right, good.
we really need an ambulance.
he needs to know...
I'll always be with him.
you're worried about him?
I can help you talk to him.
can you give him one of those?
then he'd know.
Yeah, I could do that.
I should probably tell him who it's from.
what's your name?
God, what an idiot I am.
the entire Rockland U. Rugby team, and I pass out on their table like a drunken fool.
it's all right. The good news is, you can hide in here until your cab comes.
Thanks.
I owe you.
water?
no, thank you.
but if you ever need a lawyer, I'm your
that's a pretty serious sedative.
you're taking these tonight?
Yeah, I've been, uh, I've been going through a rough patch.
rough enough to want to kill yourself?
because you mix these with alcohol, that's what's going to happen.
I know.
just lately, I, uh- - What?
huh, feel like I'm going crazy.
like, uh...
well, ha ha, like I'm being watched, and that's nuts, and this--this makes it better.
Yeah, maybe you need to get some different help.
I actually might know someone who- - right, you're right.
you know what, thank you, and tomorrow I'm gonna
this is for you.
who? Who told you to do that?
Colleen, but she's...
holy...
that woman was my worst nightmare.
this can't be happening.
because that girl, Colleen...
she died, so, um, how could you talk to her?
just take a minute.
sober up before you have any conversations
if she wasn't your girlfriend, then who was she?
Colleen, um, heh...
Oh, we, uh...
we went out a couple times.
she was an intern at my firm for about 2 years.
she was cute, smart, but...
Oh, god, this...
this is messed up.
Yeah, it is.
you see, everybody thought she was so great, you know?
but when we went out, I saw something, you know?
she was--she was...
off.
and she fell for you?
I don't know exactly what happened, but when I didn't ask her out anymore, she, uh, she flipped.
just became...
obsessed with me.
how, like stalker obsessed?
Yeah.
I mean, pretty much.
look who's still up studying the...
5 classifications of stalkers.
a little light night reading.
it's a real Grimm's fairy tale.
it starts off creepy and then goes to terrifying.
what are you still doing up?
I was getting a little lonely waiting for you to come to bed.
I'm sorry. I just couldn't stop thinking about that poor guy.
that's all right.
I'll substitute food for love.
you want a P. B.and J?
no, thanks.
Hey, did you know that most stalkers actually believe they're in a relationship with the person they're stalking?
wait, so Colleen really thinks Shane is her boyfriend?
Yeah, and they're usually mentally ill.
but Colleen, she has this kind of...
tic.
huh, you know, that makes me wonder, because, uh, sometimes muscle twitches or tics can be a side effect of anti-psychotic drugs.
that's interesting, but I think she is more of an intimacy seeker.
wants to be loved by her victim.
usually sending flowers, love notes, rarely violent.
so you think, uh, Shane doesn't have to worry about bringing in the pet rabbit just yet?
no, the fatal attraction stalker is actually called the predatory stalker.
they like to isolate or control their victims.
well, pretty much any stalker ghost would be creepy to me, so I could kind of understand Shane was on a bender.
you know in some twisted way, Colleen actually believes she cares about Shane, which means I have to convince her that the best thing for him is for her to move on.
well, if she really is a stalker, you know where to find her.
and, uh, you know where to find me.
I know you are not about to take that peanut butter up into my bed.
uh, no, no.
I was gonna take this peanut butter up into my bed.
Colleen calling...
stop it!
every monday...
an orange rose.
don't forget.
Colleen, I think you've got it wrong.
you're confused.
Shane is not your boyfriend.
you have to send them every monday.
you know, the best thing that you could do for Shane is to go into the light.
no.
he needs to know how I felt.
well, I admit the night is pretty fuzzy, in fact,
I'd kinda chalked it all up to being a drunken idiot, but I guess that's wishful thinking, isn't it?
Yeah.
I'm just gonna cut right to the chase.
I see spirits, earthbound spirits, and I've seen Colleen.
so...
you're telling me you see ghosts?
I know that it's hard to believe.
this is wild, but, um...
well, I kinda knew it.
Yeah, don't ask me how.
hold on, wait, is she here right now?
no.
no, she was downstairs.
she-- like the phone and the door?
wow, ok.
at first I was little bit relieved, but now I'm kind of freaking out.
you see, Colleen, she was crazy.
OK, I don't think she wants to hurt you.
if that helps you at all.
she just needs to cross over into the light, and I can help her do that.
OK...
uh, what I do until then?
once I get her to trust me, I might need you to talk to her.
no, see, I don't-- I don't want to talk to her.
she's warped.
no, she had this big fantasy of us together.
couldn't let it go.
she'd make up these insane stories, like trips we had supposedly been on, romantic dinners, even arguments we'd never had.
did you ever feel threatened?
well, it never quite got to where she was leaving dead rats on my doorstep, but, yeah, she was-- you know, she was sick, mentally
Hey, my lunch canceled, do you want to--oh.
excuse me.
I see you've already made other plans.
uh, no, no, no, Richard Vaughn, this is Melinda Gordon.
I met melinda and her husband last night.
Oh, ha.
my mistake.
just when I see a pretty woman in shane's office, I just assume.
he's our resident heartbreaker.
so I've heard.
uh, we had a mutual friend--Colleen.
Oh, right, pretty intern.
she was very nice, very nice.
she had quite a thing for Shane.
wasn't she the one that quit because he couldn't date interns?
you're romanticizing again.
she actually-- I think she just found a better gig.
it was a pleasure meeting you.
nice to meet you.
OK, that was completely embarrassing.
the fact is, I rarely go out.
I'm up for partner, so I pretty much live here.
do you know how Colleen died?
I heard it was some kind of accident, but I'm not really sure.
well, what about friends?
family, an address, anything, even a last name?
but that really is pretty much all I've got.
I mean, I can check to see if the firm kept any records on her.
OK.
well, if you come up with anything, um, please call me.
definitely.
look...
whatever's going on here, I really need it to stop.
promise.
Hey, what a nice surprise.
hi there.
somebody call for a handyman?
I thought I'd check that circuit problem, being that, uh, Delia might be minding the store on her own this weekend.
that's right, your mom goes into surgery on Friday.
tell me I can live in hope and tell her to leave us the keys to her apartment, right?
it's doable.
it would just be more doable if I could talk to someone who knew Colleen.
I can't even find out where she lived or worked, for that matter.
didn't you say she was an intern?
have you checked all the law firms in the area?
Yeah, that and every florist within a 10 mile radius.
I mean, she obviously paid cash for those flowers 'cause there was no record of her.
I really am stumped.
I've pretty much used up my quote of favors at the police station looking for your dad.
Yeah, I know, but Colleen has got to be on a police radar somehow.
I mean, she was stalking someone, so...
ask.
I mean, if it, you know, means a weekend away, like this one.
it does. I promise.
Oh, hey, battery?
Yep. -Ok.
talk to you later. Love you. -Bye.
it's paid to the end of the month.
how'd you know it'd be vacant?
I knew Colleen.
Oh.
maybe you'd know how to get in touch with her family, then?
no one has come for her stuff.
actually, I was hoping you knew them.
I'd like to talk to them, too.
well, it's weird, that whole who to contact section of her lease was blank.
so you think maybe she didn't have any family?
seems that way.
she'd only been here a couple of months.
kept to herself.
wouldn't even take the elevator, afraid she might have to ride with someone.
turns out, it would have been safer.
what do you mean?
she fell down the stairway.
didn't you know?
and broke her neck?
Yeah, that's how she died.
you're not really here for a rental, are you?
no.
actually, I'm here to understand more about Colleen's death.
do you mind if I just take a moment, alone?
I got ya. No problem.
Thanks.
Colleen: He needs to know...
how I felt.
he was stalking you, wasn't he?
Colleen, you don't have to do this anymore.
OK? He can't hurt you.
you're safe now.
there is no safe place.
Yes, there is.
in the light. I can help you.
no.
he's everywhere.
you'll see.
you are my desiny. Love, Shane.
thank you.
Oh, my god.
Colleen, look, I know how upset you must be, and how angry.
I'm gona ruin his life.
I know that what he did was awful, and that you want revenge, but you were meant to move on, to move past this.
well, everything that you're doing, hiding in the shadows and...
following people, that's him, not you.
do you remember where you died?
I remember running.
was Shane there?
I don't know.
that's ok.
I'm sure you had friends, family, or someone we could talk to.
no.
he made them all go away.
just Campbell.
Campbell never left me.
who is that? Is that your boyfriend?
give me a minute, will you?
this creep isn't stalking you now, is he?
no, he's not.
I just know that he really tormented Colleen and you were the detective on the case, right?
I didn't know anything about stalking, but this guy made me an expert.
so why isn't he in jail?
he's a lawyer.
knows his way around anti-stalking laws.
and he's smart.
he'll go right up to the line, but he won't cross it.
he seems like such a solid guy.
you know, he's on the fast track at his job, I mean, everyone likes him.
a lot of these guys have high power careers.
but a real relationship would get in the way of their work.
so they create an imaginary one that they can control.
Oh, I think Shane Carson really believes he was Colleen's prince charming, you know?
see, Carson is what you call a sociopathic predator.
he isolated her, pushed away everyone so that he would be the only one she had left.
then how could some creep make all of her friends leave?
by making it so that she wasn't worth the trouble of knowing.
he'd harass these people like you wouldn't believe.
he'd make up lies, manipulate them, you name it.
he wanted her all to himself.
do you think he had anything to do with her death?
it was my first thought.
but we went through all the evidence.
I couldn't tie him to it.
I can't tell you what it feels like to be a cop, and you can't help someone.
I just wanted to see the light in her eyes again.
you tried.
and you keep trying, and I know that meant a lot to her.
I'm not gonna rest until this son of a bitch is where he belongs.
be careful.
is that all you got?
I really loved you, Colleen.
we were good together.
Oh, but you never did appreciate all of the things I did for you.
even when you cheated on me...
I forgave you.
like with that C. P.A. You remember him?
I knew he wasn't right for you, but I let it play out.
you hacked into his client's records.
you know, I never told you this, but...
I was there that night you broke up.
Yeah, ha ha, I saw how that creep left you standing alone outside that restaurant.
you canceled his credit card.
the waiter wouldn't let him leave.
and who was there for you through your tears?
no, you, uh...
you broke my heart, Colleen.
but you'll never hurt me again.
you're alone!
and desperate!
it's over. -Losing your mind!
we're through. -No!
I really think you need to move on, Colleen.
I have.
she needs me.
were you there when she said that?
didn't hit me till later what she meant.
I don't think she even knew what she meant.
love's funny that way.
no, she asked me to call her, but I don't know.
it's always a delicate thing when someone's...
discovering their feelings.
Oh, she might appreciate something more personal.
Yes, thank you and I was wondering if our pd attrition never faxed over those medical forms that
yeah sure I'll hold. I'll be right with your guys. Morgon Price Academy,that's a good school,do you son go there?
not yet, but we're hoping,can I help you with something?
actually I'm looking for Melinda. I know she's here,what are you doing here?
bringing you...
this.
look, I know who you are.
and what you did to Colleen.
Hey, look, I understand how you feel.
OK, I do.
you've only heard her side of it.
of course you think I'm a bad guy.
but I'm not.
and you know that.
deep down.
we need just to sort all this out.
and it so happens I know this great little folk art dealer upstate.
Yeah, not even an hour away.
Shane, I'm married.
to a guy who has lots of cop buddies.
look...
I'm sorry Colleen mislead you, ok?
but she mislead me, too.
I know you want to hear me out.
Shane, I am onto you.
OK? This is not going to work with me.
Melinda? Are you ok?
I think it's time for you to leave.
and don't bring her into this.
Oops, is this a-- is this--is this a bad time?
Yeah, it looks like it is.
we want you to stay the hell away from me.
Oh, got it.
can't talk now.
OK, well, cool.
I'll be back later.
Oh, and a real friend...
a real friend doesn't tell someone whom they can and can't be with.
it's happening again.
no, it's not. He--he can't hurt you.
but he can hurt you.
Melinda, are you there?
what's wrong?
I was driving home, and I got a phone call from the academy.
they told me that Ned's school counselor called to inquire about specialed resources, like psychotherapy, remedial studies, for Ned!
of course.
this is how he works, he's trying to push you away from me.
well, now it looks like I lied on Ned's application, and they will never let him in!
it's started.
what eles?
he'll destroy everything...
you love until there's no one but him.
till there is no safe place.
I need to know if there's any way I can stop this guy.
he's stalking you now, isn't he?
Yeah, I think so, and I don't want to end up like colleen, so I need you to do something to trip him up.
Carson probably latched onto you 'cause you're one of Colleen's friends.
you know, you gotta consider that everybody in your life may be at risk right now.
Yeah, he already tried some stunt with my friend Delia.
how is he getting this information?
he's annoyingly charming.
and he's gotta know his way around computers.
I mean, to do the things he did, you'd need access to socials, uh, passwords, mother's maiden names
Yeah, but it's illegal.
Yeah, only I'd need a subpoena to get the computer to prove he did it, and for that, I'd need evidence of wrongdoing.
Plus, he works for a law firm.
exactly.
our only hope to nail this guy is to get a hold of those records.
and so far, shane's been way too careful to let that happen.
so other than that, there's absolutely nothing I can do to defend myself against Shane?
why do you think I hate him so much?
OK.
you know, I tried calling you, but my phone wasn't working.
you really went all out.
no, this is not happening!
get the hell out of here!
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
my husband is going to be home any second now!
I don't think so.
what does that mean?
that surgical procedure his mother had to go in for, ha ha, some kind of complication.
Yeah, he had to rush down there.
won't be back for a while.
Hello?
Anybody--hi.
Hey, I'm here to see my mom, Faith Clancy.
willows medical spa, please hold.
Oh, this can't be happening!
no service
Yeah, she checked in a couple days ago.
she is...
looks like she checked out already.
wait a minute, there's-- there's gotta be some kind of mistake.
her doctor called me, Dr. Litvack.
told me there was some kind of complications, told me to come down.
can you--can you check one more time?
Clancy. Yeah, says right here dr. Litvack released her at 11: 00 this morning?
you sure?
I'm sorry. You should have called first.
Yeah, right. My cell phone's dead.
the service is cut out for...
thank you for holding -some reason.
Shane, you son of a-- hey.
I'm really, really sorry about this, it's an emergency.
come on, honey.
sorry.
he's here. -Yeah, I know, he's in my front yard.
no.
he's going around back.
OK, please remember if he pushed you down the stairs.
I can't.
can you tell me where he is now?
I don't see him.
what?
he's gotta be out there!
maybe he's gone.
Oh, no! Melinda!
where is he?
he's outside, out the window!
Hey!
he's gone.
he jumped the fence. I saw a car, but I couldn't get a plate.
I'm gonna call the cops.
no.
he cut the phone lines.
bastard.
honey...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's ok.
I'm gonna go next door and call the cops.
I'm right there, I'm right there.
I thought I could stop him.
but I led him to you.
he'll take your life now, too.
no.
no, that's not ever going to happen.
I was wrong, and you were right.
it is time for you to get your payback.
what do you mean?
we're gonna nail Shane.
we're gonna make sure he can never do anything like this again.
how?
OK, Shane was careful.
but...
there's gotta be something he thought no one would ever see...
except a ghost.
I need you to tell me everything you've seen since you've been stalking him.
he really had files on everyone in your life?
pretty much.
from my apartment manager to detective Campbell.
where does he keep the files?
on his computer.
he was looking at one when I was there.
he...
he was checking detective campbell's file.
so he's probably keeping everyone's personal information in those files, like socials, I. D.Numbers.
did you see anything like that?
I think there were numbers.
I just remember thinking how strange it was.
he had the date when David...
detective Campbell started smoking again.
it's funny.
I remember that, too.
I gave him such grief about it, but now...
I wish I hadn't.
sounds like detective Campbell meant a lot to you.
he was the one person shane couldn't push away.
he was too strong.
he made me feel safe.
you think we really can stop him?
or are you just trying to get me into the light?
a little of both.
remember, Shane's in court on the Bergman case all morning.
assistant's name is Francis.
she thinks you're seeing Shane.
that's how he explained your last visit.
OK.
that could actually help us.
Oh, Francis, nice to see you again.
Yes.
Melinda, right? -Right.
um, I know that this is gonna sound silly, 'cause, well, Shane is in court, but, um, he worked really late last night, and I think I left something behind.
Oh.
I'll just go in- - ooh, it's awkward.
and I know that Shane and I would appreciate it if I could just go in and get it myself, seeing as how...
I know what I left behind.
right.
go ahead.
thank you.
not that one.
it's on his personal laptop.
Nope.
OK, which one of these is gonna get me into the program?
the first one.
the other one gets you into the file.
OK.
that's it.
great.
go, check.
she's coming!
what?
so embarrassing.
he must have moved it.
what's that?
wait a minute...
that's my shoe.
that's me.
I couldn't seen if he was and I paliced I ran out to the back on, god
these are all of me.
is there any way you guys were wrong, could Shane have pushed her down those stairs?
no.
there was a security surveillance tape.
Colleen was alone in the stairwell when she tripped.
it was an accident.
and I checked out Carson's alibi, it was solid.
then how did Shane take those photos?
maybe he didn't.
you should see something.
that's a crime scene photo.
got it from the cop on Colleen's case.
it's a little gruesome, isn't it?
I'm just wondering how you got it, and why you would hang it in your office.
I'm gonna have my hands full with you.
I'm a lawyer.
I have friends in law enforcement.
you framed a photos of Colleen's dead body.
that's a little strange, don't you think?
it's my way of remembering her.
tell him how happy that makes me.
Colleen is happy that you want to remember her.
well, I hope it brings her some peace.
it does.
especially now that everyone's going to remember me.
it does.
she's especially happy now that she knows the whole firm will have something to remember her by.
we sent copies to all the partners, along with a note explaining the artwork in your office.
we also made a disk of all the files you kept on Colleen.
we sent emails to your clients, but that part was just for fun.
you hacked my computer?
imagine that.
Yeah, they have a paper trail showing how you destroyed Colleen's life and everything that you did to her.
news flash, Nancy Drew!
you're just some nut I talked to once, and now you're all over me.
these things you're accusing me of?
no one cares.
Yes, they do.
because you're a lawyer, remember?
and you broke the law.
she had 10 restraining orders against you.
you stalked her, you harassed her, you stole her life long before she ever fell down those stairs, and your chances of making partner right now, by the way, zero.
he's sweating.
don't stop.
you're a pariah now.
now you have everything that you wished for Colleen
no friends, no fans, and if there's justice, no job.
it's over.
if you wanted to break up, you-- you should have said something.
we just did.
so, I think we're gonna get him on identity theft, of all things.
off the files I gave you?
not exactly.
and I don't even wanna know where you got those.
the photographs, along with Colleen's police reports gave us enough to seize the laptop.
I only wish she was here to see it.
I think she knows.
anyway, I, uh.
appreciate all you did.
this is enough to put Carson away, and he won't be practicing law anymore, so his life's pretty much over.
feels really good to finally get this guy.
so thanks.
no.
I may never see him again, I need to tell him...
um, detective...
yes?
Colleen, uh, you should just know how much you meant to her.
what do you mean?
she wasn't as alone as you thought she was.
she had you.
and you never stopped caring about her.
something tells me that, uh, that wasn't because of your job.
that obvious, huh?
remind him of the time he walked me home from the station.
he was telling me about his first arrest when he was a rookie.
do you remember the night that you walked her home?
you were telling her about your first arrest.
she told you that?
it was just a purse snatcher.
I chased him into this lake and collared him about chest-deep in water.
and for 2 weeks after that, you had flippers in your locker and wet wings on your desk.
she laughed so hard.
I hadn't seen her smile like that in a long time.
I just remember wanting to freeze that moment.
and then you got to her house?
I was standing so close...
and I just remember this
a strand of her hair fell on my face.
I just didn't want to move.
I just wanted to kiss her so bad.
took everything I had not to.
she trusted me, so...
I couldn't.
did Colleen really tell you all that?
Yeah.
she also told me that she wished you had kissed her.
Hey, wait.
what just happened?
well, believe it or not...
Hey, what's up?
I thought you had the day off.
I just wanted to drop by and tell you the good news.
Ned's application got accepted at the academy.
so how did you undo all the damage that Shane caused?
it wasn't easy, but we had his real school counselor call and just tell them it was a prank.
I am so sorry that you got caught up in all this.
what happened to that creep?
well, he got fired from his job, the county is pressing charges, he's out on bail, my guess is he's somewhere laying low, and Jim is walking me home from work every night.
that is so crazy.
well, I will see you tomorrow.
I have more errands to run.
you know what, I didn't bring those sconces up, because that basement is dead to me.
all those lights just shorted out again.
OK.
Bye.
Jim just fixed that!
Yeah, I'm looking for it right now.
Ugh, I'll call you back, delia.
miss me?
this is my husband.
like I care.
Jim: Melinda, you're not gonna believe this, but
Shane's dead, right?
Yeah, ODed. Pills, booze.
we just got the call. How did you know?
because he's right here.
Mel, get away from him, now!
this worked out the best all around.
don't you think?
now we can be together.
forever.
these are intense. Are any of these yours?
no, they're my grad students' from my masters portfolio class.
wow, you really look beautiful in this light.
wishful thinking on both our parts. It's a model, not me.
some photos down there you might enjoy.
student of mine was in bangladesh.
well, I'll tell you what I used to tell my mother when I didn't finish my dinner
I don't care about kids from India, I just care about you.
I didn't say the last part to my mother. That'd be weird.
although I'm sure she was fascinating. - She was, very...
but no mother issues here at all.
these have to be yours.
this is, uh, what, your apartment down in the east village?
do you miss it, the whole bohemian lifestyle?
no, I like teaching here just fine.
how come there's no pictures of you here at all?
come on, rick.
it's the command performance for the new dean. We're already late.
OK. So much for small talk.
this is amazing.
just 'cause the dean is former ivy, they rent out an entire restaurant.
you know what I got when I came to Rockland University?
I got a welcome packet with a few take-out menus.
professor Pollili.
Hi. I'm Stacey Adler. Not that it matters.
I know your work. I've tried to get into your classes, but they fill up so fast.
well, it's very nice to meet you, Stacey. This is professor Payne.
Oh, great. I'm going to get the spelling in just a second.
Oh, no, please.
Oh, it's just a P. R. Picture for the university magazine.
no. I said no.
I'm sorry. I just-- please, don'T.
OK. I'm-- I didn't realize. Sorry.
I can't do this.
I thought I could, but I can'T. - What? What can't you do?
look, it's not you. I just
I really don't feel well, so I'm going to go. Um...
that is weird. - Yeah, that's weird.
I know. I had her right in frame.
Wow. That is weird. Can I borrow this for a second?
actually, like, right now, this second.
it's ok. I'm a professor.
OK. Thank you very much. - Wait. Why?
because you just gave your memory card to the anthropology department.
I appreciate it.
But--wh-what about the magazine?
use your descriptive powers. Why, you know, cheat with pictures?
Hello!
I know you guys are home. I can see your cars.
are you expecting someone? - No one!
Hello?
Hello, hello, hello!
hello.
Hey. How are you, Jim?
you been working out? You look good.
there she is. Ahh. This is nice.
there's the missus, a nice crackling fire.
nice vintage-- a little pricey. "Scrupulistic" not a word.
didn't you have a date tonight?
I did have a date tonight, as it were, since you're the one that forced me back into the dating world.
what happened? - Well, what happened? I'll tell you what happened.
this might have been the first time in my life that a woman said "it's not you, it's me," and I believed her.
let me find these for you.
Oh, here's professor Reeman, russian studies.
he just got published... again.
OK. Oh, here we are. Ok. That's me.
Wow. This really is...a damn fine suit.
that's me, and next to me, that's where my date should be.
that big, empty space, that's where my date was. Ok?
here's another one. That's me sitting next to...
Ehh, no one. Nothing's there. Ok.
Oh. Here's Claudia's exit, which was abrupt, to say the least, although you can't see it on any of these photos 'cause apparently, she doesn't exist.
let me take a look at that.
so she's not showing up in any of the photos.
just admit it, Melinda-- tonight, I got dumped by a ghost.
does she even exist? - Yes. She has tenure.
it's publish or perish. Her photographs are published everywhere.
but she's not in any of them, and nor have I seen her in any of her personal photography, and the photos she has of herself on her desk with her family and things
nothing. She's not in any photos.
well, that's weird.
I mean, maybe it's something about her energy, or something the camera can't capture.
I don't think so. Paranormal occurrences usually work the opposite way.
spirits are visible in photographs because cameras detect light and heat.
but a broader spectrum of energy the human eye can't detect.
kind of like that?
OK. I've never seen this before.
hang on a second.
it's with her in every shot.
for the record, that's not who I asked out.
maybe not, but...
that's who went home with her.
I've been looking for occurrences of images being erased from a photograph.
they're hard to find.
I mean, ghosts popping up, stealing the spotlight?
I mean, they're a dime a dozen. But somebody actually being knocked from the frame?
that's-- that's unusual.
I'm more interested in the shape we saw following Claudia.
Oh, him. Yeah. Let's call him Bob.
OK. Bob. Why?
cause bob riker got my prom date drunk on peach schnapps. He stole her from me.
now they're married with 3 kids, but I don't think they're happy.
sad. But you've moved on to Claudia.
does she have any idea what happened to her?
well, she flipped out the second a camera was pointed at her, and, well, I'm no expert in composition, but it sure seems like all the pictures in her office are kind of lopsided.
like she used to be in them? - More like Bob riker took them.
can a ghost do that?
I mean, transform an existing image or print?
well, it would help if he had basic knowledge of photographic principles.
I mean, knowing how light and heat affect pigment.
a photograph is just pixels and colors.
so in theory, he could move them all around like the piece on an ouija board.
you said he. Is this Bob?
no, I'm talking about Kevin.
Kevin was one of Claudia's graduate students. He died 2 weeks ago.
and you're just telling me this now? That is, like, plain withholding.
what happened to him? - He died in a car crash.
but I didn't even know until this morning when I called cLClaudia-- which, by the way,
I was completely breaking my "don't call anyone for 48 hours after a disastrous date" rule.
I can't imagine how that came up in a conversation.
actually, a pretty smooth segue from "hey, do you know you're invisible?
that's what makes it a great photograph, that's the unspoken narrative.
it tells a story.
I will have extended office hours this afternoon, ok?
but I need to talk to these people. And Joseph, congratulations.
Oh, seriously, professor Pollili, I can't thank you enough.
see you later.
Hi. I'm Claudia. - Hi. Melinda.
the friend I was telling you about.
what happened to your forehead?
Oh, I was driving home last night and I clipped a parked car.
lucky nobody was hurt. - Except for you.
Mmm. I don't know where I'm at these days.
all I know is, I came home one day to find I wasn't in any pictures.
family, friends, travel
the photos were still there, but I was gone.
what day was that, exactly?
it was the day after kevin graham died.
your student.
he died in a car crash.
so talented. Nicest guy.
last night, did you feel anything strange, like a presence?
I don't think so.
how well did you know Kevin?
was there any reason for him to be angry with you?
Kevin had the makings of a great photographer.
he had everything that it took...
except for patience.
there was a gallery showing that he was just desperate to get into.
and he wanted me to make a call on his behalf, but I told him that he wasn't ready.
was he upset?
he took it really hard, like I was telling him he didn't have a future.
but in this business, you only get one introduction, one shot, and I didn't want to blow it for him.
I mean, I thought of 100 different ways that I could have told him, but
but you thought no matter what the outcome, it would have always been the same?
I don't know.
I mean, would he have been driving down a dangerous road at 90 miles an hour if he thought he had more to live for?
that's every teacher's worst nightmare, you know.
you toss a kid a low grade or a criticism.
next thing you know, he snaps his cap, and he wants to off himself or you.
is that what you're thinking?
maybe he found a way to do both?
I don't know.
was this always here?
this translucent shape, do you see it?
have you seen it anywhere else? - Yeah.
last week, in one of my students' work. His name's Joseph.
did he know Kevin?
Yeah.
professor Pollili knows everybody in the photo world.
she picks up the phone, and your slides get seen.
so it's that easy?
well, she has to like your work.
what about Kevin? Did she like his work?
she's tough but fair.
and no disrespect to the dead, because Kevin seemed like a nice guy, a good artist, but those 2 things, even in combination...
they're not enough. You know what I mean?
I'm not sure I do.
it's so competitive.
it's, like, this tiny market with too many people to begin with.
and if you don't have what it takes, what people want...
then you get squeezed out.
and Kevin was feeling that squeeze.
because she made phone calls on your behalf and not on his?
Yeah. Basically.
she said that you had some photos with this strange shape in them.
Yeah. Yeah, right. Uh...
that was weird.
I did this ocean series last week-- just sand, water...
and this kind of cool translucent thing.
I don't-- I don't know how it happened, but it looks great.
can I see them?
Yeah. Yeah. Um...I could email them to you. - Thanks.
I promised Delia that I'd check out her inventory spreadsheet.
I also want to download those photos from that guy Joseph.
that's Claudia's star pupil, right? The one your ghost had it out for?
if that's what it's about.
Kevin said his teacher helped another grad student get into more galleries than him.---I don't know.
I don't want to sound harsh, but boo-hoo.
or boo.
but since when have ghosts become reasonable?
it just makes me mad. - What?
that this file's taking so long, or that he's tormenting his professor?
Oh, because Claudia tried to hold him back until he was ready for the big, bad art world.
I mean, honestly, that's the worst thing that's happened to that guy? Seriously?
that's the story he wants told?
are you seeing this?
I just assumed the translucent shape was Kevin, but...
well, that doesn't look like any Kevin I've met.
either I have the wrong ghost, or he's telling a different story.
Jim saw this? - Yeah, and so we clicked back on the same file again, and then it was just a still photo of the beach.
that's a haunting. She's made her presence known.
Yeah, but I don't get it. What does she want us to know?
for starters, she probably wants you to know you checked the wrong box under "sex of ghost.
OK, fine, so she's a girl, not a guy.
but this all began with Kevin's death, and I think he's the key.
maybe Claudia knows more than she's saying.
or even realizes.
Claudia, what happened in here?
she's everywhere.
here, all my pictures at home.
joseph came by, and she's in all his pictures, too.
who is she? - I don't know.
joseph swears he doesn't know, either.
Why's this happening? - I don't know.
it's unusual for a ghost to want to haunt a complete stranger.
maybe it has something to do with this place.
well, maybe it's not something you did.
how well do you know this Joseph? - He's a student.
I'm not involved in his personal life.
well, did Kevin ever talk to you about a girl? I mean, maybe this joseph's lying.
maybe it was some kind of romantic triangle
I told you. I don't know her, ok?
how am I supposed to help you? I've never seen this girl before in my life.
so this ghost is now showing up in Claudia's pictures and Joseph'S.
Claudia seems to be falling apart because of it, and Joseph, as far as I can tell, is shrugging it off as weird.
there's still days I wish I was 23
I believe that I will not have anything to happen.
you want mustard with this? - No, thanks.
what's that?
Oh, this, it's just a study guide.
isn't it for medical school? - Well, yeah, technically. Sure.
OK, so you're gonna go to medical school? That's great!
Mel, there's a big difference between going and applying.
the southern michigan catalog, is that why we got that?
I thought it was just junk mail.
look, I'm just checking out the possibilities, ok?
or, in my case, the impossibilities.
look, the chances of getting in anywhere are so slim, I thought, since my dad went there, I had an edge being a legacy.
so you're not just gonna change careers, we might be moving to michigan.
no. I haven't even applied.
what about our life here? And my store.
I mean, were you even going to talk to me about this?
of course. I'm just trying to figure it out by myself at first.
I'm your wife, so why aren't you figuring it out with me?
this is a huge conversation, all right?
and it isn't just about your store, you know that. It's about what you do.
I mean, that's the real discussion, isn't it?
I mean, whether we could ever leave grandview knowing what we know about this place and what's underneath it.
that's why I wanted to wait. Look, I don't even know what I want here.
or what I even have the right to ask you about.
Jim... - let's just talk about it later, all right?
I gotta go to work, you gotta cross over a nasty ghost.
another one, that's what you mean.
no, I didn't mean that. I didn't say that.
look, I love you, ok? We'll figure this out.
is this Kevin? - Yeah. You never met him?
he was a friend of a friend. - Well, it's nice of you to help out.
I can't imagine packing up someone's life.
uh, this girl. Do you know her?
cause I'm trying to get in touch with her.
I gave him a lease to sign, and ran into him getting mail once.
he was always alone.
I'm gonna be here for a little bit. Is that ok?
just drop the keys downstairs. - Thank you.
Hi, this is Kevin. You know what to do, so do it.
saved messages.
Hey, it's Sophie. Um, obviously.
look, I know you're pissed, but we need to talk, and not on the phone.
I love you.
and you can't get rid of me that easy.
and here you go.
I am so sorry! Do you need some help?
no, no, we're ok. It's fine.
all right, you good? - Yeah.
OK, great.
I'm so sorry. I didn't even know we had a customer until 5 seconds ago.
well, I might be a little distracted, too, if I thought I just saw somebody drown.
well, it was a vision, so it's just something the ghost experienced, but if I don't know who she is, I can't even help her.
I've checked obits for her.
and I've checked Sophies, Sophias, the local area in iowa where Kevin's from.
you know what, maybe I should check accidental drownings.
Yeah, but why?
didn't her message say "you can't get rid of me that easily?
well, maybe he did.
and maybe the guilt over what he had done got to him.
or her ghost did. I mean, it would explain how their deaths are tied.
but it doesn't explain the connection with Kevin's professor or the other student.
well, what about Kevin's phone?
maybe her last name would show up on the caller I. D.
he didn't have it.
did he have a cell phone? - I didn't see one.
you said he died in a car accident, right?
when was the last time you got in a car and you didn't have your cell phone?
you're right. You're right.
maybe the police have it, or the morgue.
now would be a great time to ask jim for a favor.
I've got the store covered. Go, go.
it's not that, but thanks.
we kind of had an argument.
looks like jim might be going to medical school.
which is amazing, and see how your face just lit up?
that was-- that was my face.
then I realized he's looking out of state, and he hid it from me.
you know, Melinda, that is a huge decision.
and I'm sure he had a lot of reservations about it.
no, his reservation is about living here.
especially after what happened in the tunnels.
they're just holding Kevin's stuff till the highway patrol report comes in.
thanks for calling in a favor. - Sure.
it's funny what survives.
there's a few recent calls...one from Sophie.
check the timestamp.
day that Kevin died.
it's a video.
she's at the beach.
I trusted you.
I gave up my life for you.
that's what you want, isn't it?
she sent that to Kevin? - Oh, my god.
she's gonna drown.
what is it?
I think we just saw a 21st century suicide note.
patient was complaining of chest pains. We administered an E. K.G.
I'm looking at the irregularities. He's got S. T. Elevations.
looks like he's having a heart attack.
did you administer thrombolytics? - Uh, no.
I mean, he doesn't have the classic complaints.
he's got no arm discomfort.
he's got no diaphoresis, as you can see.
look, he has sharp pains. He leans forward, he feels relief.
I mean, could it be pericarditis?
he's having chest pains with S. T. Elevations. We have to treat this as a heart attack.
let's get going on the thrombolytics.
don't you think there's a chance there might be
we'll take it from here. Thanks for bringing it in.
Hello?
Ok...Sophie, I'm here.
and I want to understand what happened to you.
why did you hurt yourself?
what are you doing?
where did you get these?
um, it's complicated, but I think the girl who's been showing up in your photos wanted me to see this.
Oh, my god.
Claudia, I'm not here to judge you, but I think that someone got hurt by what you and Kevin did.
you don't know anything. You can't.
I know a girl name Sophie who is in love with Kevin, and she said that she would give up her life for him, and I watched her do it.
and I think it's because Kevin was sleeping with you.
what did you say her name was?
she killed herself, and now she's haunting you.
and I don't think she's going to stop.
I can't take this another second. Do you understand?
please.
please just leave me alone.
you're making a big mistake.
it wouldn't be the first.
you have to know, I have never been involved with a student before.
never even thought about it.
with Kevin, there's just this connection.
of course there was. He looked up to you. You were his teacher.
it wasn't just that he looked up to me.
I know it was wrong.
I knew it was wrong then.
but he was just so passionate, so talented.
look, I'm in no position to judge here, ok, but you were his teacher.
that's not a relationship between equals. That's why this is a problem.
I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you.
you know what, it's ok. You gave me a hundred reasons why not to go out with me.
it turns out it was just one. I got it.
OK, why don't you tell me more about Sophie?
I, um...knew that he had a girlfriend back home.
they were having problems.
but I didn't think that she knew about me.
and we were over.
Kevin had already ended it, and, to be honest, I think I was a little relieved, thinking, stupidly, that we'd gotten out without anyone being hurt.
but then, when you said her name, Sophie, I just felt sick.
how can both of these people be dead?
I'm trying to figure out the same thing.
Claudia, there was a...
a timestamp on the suicide video that she sent to Kevin.
they died within an hour of each other.
Oh, my god.
that's why he ran out.
then do it. One phone call to one gallery.
Kevin, belive me, these people are such snobs, and you are not ready.
if they pass on you once, that's it.
a second phone call from me isn't going to get you a second chance.
you need time to-- - I don't have time.
it's Sophie. - Take it.
I know how much she means to you.
we're done, I know that.
I gave up my life for you.
that's what you want, isn't it?
no wonder he was driving 90 miles an hour down that terrible road.
he was trying to get to her. - Or he realized he was too late, and he didn't care if he ever made it.
you said that he spoke about her once before.
her, um, her last name was owens.
Kevin said that she had a sister in bridgeport.
maybe the sister can tell you what you need to help sophie move on.
Hi.
can I help you?
Sophie? - Yeah.
do I know you?
I saw you die.
I told myself
I told myself his death was just a stupid accident.
but what happened to you, that was no accident.
no.
no, I tried to hurt myself, but I couldn't go through with it.
it's horrible to even think about.
but... but what I don't understand is how...you saw it.
Kevin's cell phone was with his effects.
um, those photos, has anything changed in them since Kevin's death?
no.
what are you talking about?
and how did you know kevin exactly?
I know how he hurt you. - How could you?
after Kevin's death, some strange images started showing up in photographs.
Oh, what kind of images? - Ghostly images.
it was sort of a white, wispy image at first, and then there were images of you, drowning from the video that you sent kevin.
this doesn't make any sense.
see, he was actually able to take the skills he had in life to...
torment people in death.
your images were used for a professor at rockland university.
Oh. Of course that was her.
I'm so stupid.
he used to talk about her all the time.
for everyone's sake, can you please just tell me what happened?
you said something in your message that he couldn't get rid of you so easily.
because we've been fighting so much.
every time I hung up, I wondered if we had broken up.
he wanted me to give up my job in Iowa and move here,
if we kept it long distance, our relationship just wasn't gonna make it.
we fought and fought until I decided I was going to make the committment.
he always got mad 'cause he said I wasn't interested in his work.
but I didn't understand it.
I mean, what could he see through the lens of his camera that made him so happy?
I got my answer.
all of a sudden, my...
my body went cold. I couldn't--I couldn't breathe.
I had to get out of there, but I didn't know where to go.
next thing I knew, I was at the beach.
I used to go there when I'd come visit, and Kevin would ask me to stay.
and here I was, and for good.
and for what?
I felt so...
empty and stupid and...disposable.
my heart hurt so much I wanted to die.
it--it wasn't something that I planned.
it was just something I did without thinking.
I--I think a part of me believed that was what he deserved to be hurt with pictures the way he hurt me.
I gave up my life my for you.
that's what you want, isn't it?
the waves just kept knocking me back.
my lungs filled with water, my body just took over.
it made me realize how crazy I was being.
I mean, to let anyone have that much power over me.
I raced back to the apartment.
by the time I got there, the police were calling, saying there'd been an accident.
I wanted to hurt him, but not like that.
I didn't want him to get hurt like that.
I need you to help me reach him.
Why?
because Kevin's spirit or whatever is trying to torture this Claudia person?
Yes.
Sophie, I know how hard this is, I really do, but haven't enough people been hurt?
maybe it's just her guilt that's haunting her.
I don't know who you are or how you know all these things, but...
if she's suffering, then it's because of what they did, not me.
and that's all I have to say.
you have my number.
what?
No! No, Kevin!
no, Kevin!
please, please...
Hello?
Sophie, it's me, Melinda.
Sophie, breathe. Please breathe.
what?
OK.
OK.
Yes, I need an ambulance at 215 havenwood lane.
Yes, I'm in the residence.
I thought she was dead. - You're scaring her.
you have to cross over. Yes, I'm here.
um, yes, she is breathing now, but she has asthma.
no, I gave her the inhaler.
OK, deep breaths.
OK? Deep breaths.
will you tell her I'm here? - You're hurting her.
I've seen more than you know.
OK? And I know what happens to people when they don't
OK, Sophie, it's going to be all right. Hello?
Yes, I'm still here. Please hurry.
wow, I feel bad for the guy, that's a brutal procedure.
but you said he's stable? And it was pericarditis?
Oh, good. All right. Well, if he's ok.
Thanks, man. Bye.
so you were right about the guy not having a heart attack.
Yeah, but then the medication they gave him, you see, it unclogs everything, and his heart chamber filled with blood, and they had to do this really invasive procedure to drain it.
Oh, that's awful.
the E. R. Doctor should have listened to you. - No, not really.
I mean, she read the E. K.G. She made a quick diagnosis. That's her job.
that's what sucks about being a doctor, I guess.
it's a lot of guess work on the fly.
you'd be a great doctor... if you wanted to be.
Yeah.
it's just, you're always so supportive of me, and...
I want to do the same for you.
OK, let'S... let's just do first things first, ok?
I see what you go through, you know? I know the stakes.
and you were late tonight because basically, you were saving somebody's life.
that's not the point. - No, it is the point.
what you do for people, come on, it's not like a job.
I can't ask you to give that up.
you know, to take care of me.
but, honey, you can't ask me to stop wanting to take care of you.
Jim-- - no, and you're right.
because what that makes me do is sometimes want to get you the hell out of here.
people die everywhere.
their ghosts can find me. - No.
you and I both know there's something about this place.
lately, I haven't been able to shake the feeling that maybe we didn't choose grandview.
maybe it chose us.
I think the same thing.
but if that's true, it had to be for a reason.
and a good one, and I'm not going to run away from that.
so if that's your only reason for wanting to leave grandview, then...
I'm sorry, I can't support that.
so what are we supposed to do, just wait for some sign from kevin?
Sophie, this is Claudia.
Claudia, this is Sophie.
I know exactly who you are.
what is she doing here?
I know how hard this is for you.
but I think you both need to forgive each other and move on with the rest of your lives.
I never meant for anyone to get hurt.
then why'd you do it? Why'd you take something that wasn't yours?
she didn'T. I did.
he's here.
you tell Sophie that I-- I just lost my way without her.
he said he was lost without you.
there were so many times I asked her to move to the east coast with me, and all she ever thought about was how would we make it without her job, and all I heard was she thought I wasn't gonna make it.
he thought you didn't believe in him.
I did. I dropped everything to come here.
I didn't know that. I was so focused on trying to make a sale, or even having an actual show so she'd see that I wasn't going to fail.
he wanted to prove himself to you.
he wanted to make a sale, and
that's why he got so angry when I wouldn't help him.
Yeah, I wasn't fair.
to either of them.
he knows that you were just trying to protect him.
tell her that I'm so sorry.
I will.
but I ended up hurting the one I loved the most.
he feels terrible about what happened.
he wanted the truth to come about what he had done and how he had hurt you.
and he knew you'd be the only that could tell it.
I just wanted to mean as much to you as your work did.
and I loved the way you looked at the world. I just...wondered, did you see me?
Sophie, you were in everything that I did.
and everything that I made, you were a part of it all.
can you make her understand?
is that the light?
it's so incredible.
look... you tell her that I can't go unless I know she's forgiven me.
he needs to know that you forgive him.
I forgive you, kevin.
and I'm not sorry that I loved you. At least I know I can.
he's gone.
a picture = 1000 words here's one - thanks
I hate fighting.
neither of us ever wins.
I know you're just trying to protect me.
I've been thinking a lot about the dark spirits don't just lurk underground.
that they're around me all the time.
I just want you to know that that doesn't scare me.
how is that reassuring?
Because...anger and darkness, that's just the stuff we're supposed to unravel and learn from.
and I do that all the time, with the spirits.
and I'm not afraid because...
I know that love is stronger.
I've seen it.
OK. No decisions based on fear.
no decisions based on fear.
does that include trigonometry and organic chemistry, because these are terrifying.
it means a whole year of undergrad courses before I can even apply.
Oh, my god.
you're gonna do it, aren't you?
well, if you can fight the forces of evil, I think I can do pre-med.
say it.
I really need to hear you say it.
I want to be a doctor.
what are you getting?
Just...close your eyes. I got you something.
OK.
pick a city or a town, doesn't matter how big or how small.
when you get into med school, I'll be right there with you.
No! - I will always love you, Melinda.
not you.
you have to cross over.
I don't want to.
you're back.
do I know you?
I see the same guy that you see-- different hair, nose, eyes.
it's not Jim.
I just know what I see when I look in those eyes, and Jim is in there somewhere.
wait. You're not gonna tell me you think I'm your husband reincarnated,
because you're the only sane person I've met since I woke up.
I bought that less than a month ago.
do you know how lucky you are?
you are gonna get a second shot at your one true love.
seems like you've had a lot on your mind lately.
Yeah. I mean, there's just a lot of stuff that doesn't fit-- shoulder pain, the weird, violent memories.
you know, I'm gonna do what you told me.
I'm gonna find somebody who understands. - Like?
Nicole. You know, who would know me better?
that's a good question.
OK, I have silverware, candlesticks.
what about the china?
is it too middle-aged?
it's perfect. Why are you so nervous?
I'm not nervous.
it's just been ages since I've thrown a dinner party and
twice that long since I've seen Marla and Jody, so, ok, I guess I'm a little nervous.
here's a thought.
you could just cancel or go out, you know, without me.
it's one dinner party.
besides, you and Eli are gonna have a ball mocking me.
Yeah, Friday night with mom and her high school theater geek friends.
good times.
you invited Eli?
well, he makes a living out of talking to strangers.
wish you would reconsider.
sorry. Told you. Plans.
tearing your hair out while Sam goes and visits his fiancee in Raleigh does not constitute plans.
actually I'm going with him.
you saw him remember his paramedic skills.
I mean, his memory's coming back, so now he just needs a crash course in Jim Clancy.
a crash course?
look, when I was opening the shop
Jim and I used to love taking road trips.
we'd hit all the estate sales, antique shops, listen to music,
play games, stop by our favorite restaurants.
so you think by recreating all of that, it might jog something?
look, Sam thinks he should know Nicole,
so he'll wanna believe whatever she says, which'll only confuse him more.
you could just tell him the truth.
Yeah, i tried that once, and he looked at me like I was completely nuts.
I just have to get him to remember Jim, you know, but gently, so he doesn't get scared away.
the heating guys are coming first thing tomorrow.
could you swing by the house and let them in for me?
sure. What time?
7 a. m.
maybe I should just cancel.
no. I'll do it.
well, that's nice. Thanks.
Oh, I get it.
you're thinking maybe you should spend the night, housesit, and be there in the morning for the heating guys.
Yeah, and I have an English lit paper due on monday, so I could use the peace and quiet.
it would help me out.
fine. Fine. Abandon your own mother.
so how did you talk Sam into letting you go?
well, I haven't yet.
but trust me. I have a foolproof plan.
wait, you--you bought a garage full of furniture?
uh, antiques. I got 'em online.
now you're gonna drive down to Raleigh, too?
uh, new hope, actually. It's about an hour from there.
anyway, with the price of gas, I just thought
Aw, Melinda, I don't know.
I mean, Nicole called me and left me a message the day before the accident saying, Yeah, she'd meet me if I was serious about the proposal, but I mean, now she must think I got cold feet.
she won't return my calls.
she's changed her cellphone number.
I just don't know how she's gonna react, and if you're there
well, I could make myself scarce, you know, while you guys are talking, if you need to reconnect,I mean.
Melinda, I just owe her an explanation, right?
maybe she could explain some things for me.
like?
you know, like how I got all that medical knowledge.
you know, if we do share the driving, could get there early tomorrow morning,
and I could just use the change of scenery, so...
you and me, a road trip?
all right. What the heck, huh? Why not?
but, um...
is all that stuff in the garage gonna fit in my pickup probably not.
which is why I got us a truck.
so you're cool if I just stay for drinks, right?
if you want me to beg, I'll beg.
I doubt that I have anything in common with these girls, and you--you can talk to anybody.
Yeah, but usually I get paid for it.
well, I really should get goin'.
traitor.
I got it, ok?
well, hello.
Jode, you didn't tell me Delia was seeing someone.
I'm Marla, and this is Jody.
I'm Eli.
Delia and I are just friends. We're not dating.
but how 'bout you two ladies?
Oh, we're not dating.
Oh, my god! Look at you!
I know.
Oh, my god. You look beautiful.
I see you've met Eli.
Yes, we did.
Oh, Eli, would you mind opening one of these?
sure, my pleasure. - Thank you.
and who is this?
Ah, this is Ned, my son.
he's actually going out, but he wanted to stay and meet you guys.
Oh, I wish you could meet my daughter carly.
you'd like her.
maybe next time.
Oh, god. It's official.
we are now our parents' age when we were in high school.
this calls for alcohol.
well, it was nice to meet you. Have fun.
OK. - Bye.
we've got 25 years of catching up to do.
Logan, I already texted Dylan.
I can't go out with you guys.
b-because I'm housesitting and
Logan, hang on a sec.
Hello?
whoever's there, Melinda isn't home.
and since I can't see or hear you, maybe you should
Logan. - Gotta call you back.
what are you guys doin' here?
you couldn't come to the party, so we brought the party to you.
wait. How much furniture did you buy?
an entire estate sale.
I didn't know how big of a truck we needed.
if you wanted somethin' smaller, you should have called before.
no, no, no, no. It's fine. 'Cause you know what?
we might go to other estate sales, maybe even thrift shops. I mean, doesn't that sound like fun?
Yeah. I mean, we are in kind of a hurry, I mean.
what is this stuff?
just in case we get bored on the road.
come on. We'll put our bags in the back. - Yeah.
you ok?
that is such a loud door.
you can see me, can't you?
you can!
thank god! Where are you people headed?
Raleigh.
I call shotgun.
if you were in Nicole's shoes, you'd want an explanation, too, right?
my name is Frank, Frank Whitaker.
if you'll just talk to me.
not now.
why not now?
she's probably angry as hell that I flaked on her, again.
well, hopefully she'll understand.
you ok? - Yeah. Just stretching.
how 'bout some music for the road?
Oh, this song, it was popular when we...
I--sorry--moved to Grandview.
it was playing when I found the vacant storefront on town square.
Oh, I get it. You like him.
what, are you married, divorced? What?
look, I'm not going anywhere, so if you wanna get me out of your hair
uh, you know what? I just remembered there's a phone call that I have to make, so...
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
Hey, Frank. It's Melinda.
got your voice mail, but It was a little garbled, so what were you saying?
thank you.
I rented this truck to haul some stuff to a coin show.
I'm a numismatist.
anyway, I was fixing a flat on the shoulder outside Charlotte when the jack gave away.
man, did that hurt.
OK, you know what?
the reception's a little rough out here, so if you could just get to the point.
OK, there's a 1943 copper penny fell into a crack ar the cargo door.
it's worth a fortune.
I--I been tryin' to pick it up forever, but, hey, watch this.
my wife could use the money.
I need you to find that penny and send it to her.
june Whitaker on Allenwood in Raleigh.
she's in the book. Will you do that for me?
be happy to help.
Ohh, thank you.
well, it's about damn time. Ciao.
there weren't enough guys in drama,
so we did some gender bending with that--that one act by that French guy.
Yes!
thank god somebody has a functioning memory.
anyway, Marla was playing Valere, the male lover,
and when she kissed Deally, the place went nuts.
Oh, I could imagine.
God, memory lane's such a dead-end street.
let's party already.
Eli, I'm so glad you stayed.
Oh, wouldn't have missed it.
Deally, more champagne?
no, no, no. Just 2 is my limit.
you know, motherhood and all.
you never know when
that's more like it.
deal, d-did you just put this on? - No. No, i didn't.
Hey, watch it.
this was playing at the wrap party.
Yeah. That was the night that, uh
excuse me.
hello. Yeah. Hi, mrs.
what?
who are all these people?
your party must have gone viral.
this isn't my party. - Really?
then whose is it? - Mom.
OK, guys, party's over.
everybody can start cleaning up!
and nobody is leaving without a designated driver!
mom, listen-- - no, you listen to me.
you wanna make some excuses, you can save your breath.
now, get to work. You're comin' home with me.
but this isn'my-- - now!
let me just tell you what happened.
no, I know exactly what happened.
you violated my trust and Melinda's.
I told Dylan that I couldn't go out tonight because I was housesitting, and then the next thing
you let them in!
they brought alcohol.
were you drinking? - No.
will you just chill for a second?
chill? Come back here, I'm talking to you.
please shut up.
don't be slamming doors!
I didn't. - I did.
stop, ok. Just stop.
you need to go to bed, and I need to think clearly about your punishment.
Delia Rayburn, the party animal?
no way.
Oh, my god.
how are you?
that was quick. Is that her?
no, her roommate, uh, Cheryl.
uh, Nicole took off 2 days after I never showed up, and then she made Cheryl promise she'd never tell me where she was.
I'm sorry. So it's a dead end.
not exactly.
Cheryl gave me Nicole's new number.
I didn't wanna do this over the phone.
Hey, it's me. Leave a message. - Voice mail.
Nicole, hi. It's Sam.
I'm really sorry I never explained to you why I didn't show up, and I just
I had this accident, and my life's been messed up ever since.
uh, I just would really like a chance to explain what happened.
well, I hope to hear from you. Bye.
Hey, you're not goin' anywhere until
Melinda's heater guy, remember.
well, I want you home right after so we can talk.
whatever.
brightness.
when did you get so... old?
um, is somebody here?
God.
come on, Doobie-ah.
you know, loosen up a little.
have some fun.
that'll work.
OK, where's the ghost?
uh, this is me you're talking to.
sorry. I'm not a morning persrson.
well, it's in here somewhere.
well, I believe "it's" a she.
I heard her talking at dinner last night.
teenager, kind of snarky.
well, do you think Ned brought home some rand ghost girl?
no. I believe she came with your friends, looking for a party.
uh, hello?
wherever you are, I can hear you, maybe even help you.
well, if she's here, she's not talkin'.
Oh, my god.
that song that played last night.
she was a girl that we went to high school with.
I had drama class with her.
she loved to party so...
if it really is Angie, you gotta help me get rid of her.
that girl was nothing but trouble, just always wasted, and if she's hangin' around Ned
how'd she die?
uh, she got really messed up on our senior wrap night, and, uh,
she decided to walk home, and then the next day, we heard that she got hit by a car.
anyway, that is not the only reason why I called you.
no, thanks. Makes me paranoid.
no. I-- I found this here. I know my son.
and this is not like him, and Angie the pothead just happened to show up at my house the night
before I find drugs in it.
Oh, sure. Blame me. You suck!
kids today. Kids yesterday.
this is nuts. You are a therapist.
ghost or no ghost, how--how am I supposed to confront Ned about this?
first of all, I wouldn't confront anyone until I was sure it was his.
what? You had the banger sisters over here last night.
what makes you think they didn't bring the ghost and the ganja?
find something?
see a penny, pick it up.
that's old. That could be worth somethin'.
Yeah. I have a--a friend who's a collector, so whenever I find anything, I send it to her.
you for real?
it's a lot of stuff.
it's Nicole. I should, uh
Yeah, thanks for callin' me back.
Nah, I know. I know.
I really owe you an explanation, but this is gonna sound completely crazy.
look, I was in an accident on my bike-- uh, motorcycle...
put that down.
anything at all. - Sorry.
you know what? I'll find a really nice place for your things，
but you should go into the light.
on her deathbed I'd be buried with her brooch, and my sister--heh.
my senile sister forgot.
I'm sorry about that.
but if you've already been buried
my funeral's tomorrow, silly. I'm at Callaway mortuary.
open casket.
and that, um-- the little treble clef.
Yes, thank you, dear.
but you're the only person truly who can help me remember
Yeah.
OK. You, too.
so how did that go?
she told me to have a nice life.
that's cold.
I don't know. I wouldn't blame her.
why should she believe me?
I'm sorry.
well, I should get the truck loaded. It's a-- it's a long drive.
OK. I'm so sorry to bother you.
Yeah, it was, uh, great seeing you, too. I'll call you.
no, I promise. Really. Ok. Bye.
Marla and Jody both said no, so that leaves Ned-- my worst nightmare.
so if it is Ned's, any chance Angie would have led you to that joint on purpose?
well, if she did, she did it to stir up trouble.
that was her specialty.
she might just be a nuisance ghost, or she's stuck in some juvenile defiance thing
and acting out through Ned, or she was thinking you may be a little more shall we say...
simpatico.
where did you get my yearbook?
at your house this morning.
I've been reading what people wrote to you, and from what I can gather, it sounds like Angie wasn't the only one who liked to par-tay.
Yeah. Well, one of us grew out of it.
and the other one died.
all the more reason I don't want Ned to make the same mistakes that I did.
then you need to have a sit-down, get him to open up about it.
easier said.
Delia, if you get involved with this now, you can nip it in the bud.
so to speak.
why would I lie about amnesia?
I mean, who even gets amnesia?
it happens obviously.
here I am goin' on about things when you're tryin' to pay respects to your mother's friend and
no, it's ok. I hardly know...
Myrna very well.
um, my mom just told me that she died and asked me to stop by, so...
you didn't know her very well?
wh-why do you keep doin' these random nice little things for people?
I mean like this, and you mailed that penny
karma. You know, do unto others, that whole thing.
Oh, yeah? Well, what would you do in my shoes?
Oh, that's-- that's hard to say.
I don't believe you.
I think if you left somebody hanging, you'd wanna go see them face to face, wouldn't you?
so that's what I'm gonna do.
OK. Ok, but
but first, I'm starving, and I know this great ace near here.
do you-- do you like mexican?
I don't remember.
something tells me you're gonna love it.
so, um, just--just wait for me in the truck, and
Yeah.
they did a lovely job, didn't they?
except for that hair.
here you go.
do you see a light?
I do now. Bless you.
is everything ok?
heating's fixed. Finished my paper.
no parties.
great. So let's talk.
figured.
look, those kids just showed up, I swear,
and the next thing I knew, it was out of control.
OK. I believe you about that.
what does that mean?
look, you know you can talk to me about anything, right?
for example, if you're into any kind of drugs, you can tell me.
what? I'm not doing drugs.
I know. Hypothetically, if you were, you could come and talk to me.
after the way you acted last night?
hypothetically, probably not.
I was angry.
obviously you still are.
Yes. Sometimes people make bad choices just so they can fit in,
and if your friends are gettin' high or smokin' pot,
you need to tell me about that.
I'm not smoking anything.
Really?
then why did I find a joint in your room?
it's so after-school special.
are you kidding me?
maybe one of your friends brought it.
well, they didn't.
if you would just be honest-- - I am. It wasn't me.
best sangria in the world... - Yeah?
from my very limited experience. - All right.
well? Was I right?
Yeah. I mean, it's good. It's kind of sweet, though.
I'll probably end up drinkin' beer with dinner. Sorry.
Hey, I'm-- did I see you put something in your mom's friend's casket?
that. Yeah, it was a brooch.
I--I guess the piece was really important to her.
so I am hungry. Are you hungry?
Yeah. Yeah, I am hungry. I'm hungry. You've been here before, right?
several times. - With Jim, huh?
sorry. I keep doin' that. - No, it's fine.
look, I know that Jim would want me to be happy, and I will be,
so in his honor, I just keep moving forward.
all right. - Great.
world's greatest mole sauce.
Oh, yeah? Ok. Try it. - Yeah.
all right. You're right. That is really--that's...
wait a minute. I've-- I've had this before.
I've tasted this before more than once.
I-I'm guessing that you have.
are you ok? - Yeah. It's just maybe a kind of a sensory overload.
you know, the music, the food.
Melinda, I've-- I've been here.
Really?
uh, I mean, do you think that-- you think you and I...
yes?
might have been here at the same time?
you know, like, uh, me and Nicole and-- and you and Jim sittin' at--I mean, that'd be a weird thing, huh?
I mean, what a small world.
Wh-what's wrong?
Oh, no. I've gotta be allergic to this. Excuse me. Sorry.
excuse me, does anyone have antihistamines?
mom.
Hello?
in Memoriam
gave TO THAT BIG - Yeah. - Hey, Delia, it's Marla. Look, about your call earlier...
I don't--I don't understand.
um, excuse me. Your name is-- your name is Cal, right?
do I know you? - No.
no, I-I have a-- a message for you from Drina.
DRINA? - What about Drina?
she says,
what?
uh, What?
ahh, did she just...
who does she think she is?
you're saying my girlfriend looks like a hooker?
Oh, no. Uh, Drina
Drina's been dead for 2 years. Who the hell are you?
Hey, hey, what's goin' on? There's gotta be a misunderstanding, right?
Oh, yeah. Let me clear it up.
Hey, you know, there really has been a misunderstanding.
Hey, are you ok?
Sam. Hey, are you ok?
Yeah. You know, a couple stitches, a tetanus shot, but, um, you know, you should see the other guy.
like, speaking of which, what happened back there?
well, let's just say I won't be using my high school spanish again.
