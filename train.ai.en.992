we're getting a ton of chatter on the web.
Max is telling everyone that they have something big.
Mike, you have to stop them before our files end up on the internet.
we have reason to believe that your daughter stole classified information.
what information?
Carrie says she doesn't have anything on her.
is there any other way she could've transmitted the information out of the SSC?
even if she pulled the files using a wireless trawler, she'd have to dump them to a drive.
the congressman's cell phone!
Carrie, she downloaded the files to the congressman's cell phone.
congressman, do you have your cell?
of course. - May I see it?
sorry, dad.
Carrie. Carrie, can you hear me?
something happened.
Billy, play back the last ten seconds of that phone call.
congressman, do you have your cell?
of course. - May I see it?
that did not sound good.
I'll take that, daddy.
are we ready to roll?
she's going with us.
Mike, we lost contact with Carrie.
there was some sort of crash.
there was.
Kitt, normal mode.
Max tracked the congressman's cell phone.
everybody stay back!
Nikki's gone.
and I think they took Carrie hostage.
Kitt, call an ambulance. The congressman's down.
they had another car waiting.
we can trace them via the congressman's phone.
no, we can't.
she pulled out the battery.
any sign of Carrie?
Kitt, you picking up anything?
there are no discernable traces of agent rivai in the immediate vicinity.
what about these tracks? I want infrared.
I have analyzed the vehicles on site.
the treads do not match any of their tires.
Kitt's right, they don't match the emergency vehicles or police cars on the scene.
it's possible the tracks are from the getaway car.
the tread is from a Goodyear Assurance Comfort tread.
it's one of the most popular brands of tires sold and distributed in North America.
of course it is.
great. That narrows it down.
we got something here.
looks like an oil leak.
that's correct, Michael.
is that leak from the getaway car?
based on its viscosity, and level of oxidation, there is a 93% chance it is.
Kitt, analyze the roads within 100-mile radius and search for a car with a fluid leak at the same rate per distance.
there are exactly 47 vehicles within those parameters.
probability is high that one of them is the vehicle Max is driving.
they should be within striking distance of Nikki and Max.
still narrowing. There are 23 vehicles on that stretch of highway that could be a match for the car Nikki and Max are driving.
got anything, Kitt?
I do not detect our primary targets, nor agent Rivai.
how many of the cars have cell phones?
the signals are from 20 cars.
check the remaining three.
that's right, she dumped the battery.
Kitt, I need to see inside those cars.
accessing satellite imagery.
putting it on-screen now.
got it.
any sign of Rivai?
Kitt, give me heat signatures.
heat signatures on-screen.
she's not moving.
Kitt, is she alive?
come on, carrie. Move.
we got movement!
Mike, go!
with pleasure.
we can download now.
Houston, we have a problem.
what is it?
she turned on her father's cell.
she must have another battery.
it's uploading our files to the internet.
Billy, run the sweeper program. - Not working.
Mike, I can't stop the transfer.
Kitt, deploy E.M.P.
it'll stop the car and fry the cell phone.
Michael, at their current speed, there is a nearly 100% probability that the electromagnetic pulse will cause the vehicle to flip.
what if we take out a tire?
it will cause an uncontrollable spin resulting in a cataclysmic crash.
okay, bad idea.
what if we take out both rears at the same time?
causing both rear tires to deflate simultaneously should result in the least dangerous outcome.
unfortunately, I cannot fire two spikes simultaneously.
Kitt, take the wheel.
you take the right, I'll take the left. On my mark.
if we do not fire at exactly the same moment - I know, Kitt.
fire!
their upload almost complete.
Carrie's safety is your first concern, Mike.
once they complete the transfer, they won't need her anymore.
come on. Get up.
you have no idea what you're doing.
I could say the same thing about you.
urs yo buyer?
china? North korea?
I'm not selling them.
this isn't about some tech war.
it's about telling the truth.
to who? The American people.
we just uploaded the files to the internet to expose the lies and hypocrisy of the people you work for.
you don't even know who you work for, do you?
I jammed the transfer, but ran a mimic program to make it look like it went through.
boy genius as it gain.
I'm feeling tingly all over.
get that, Mike?
transfer is complete, baby.
we're good to go.
hate to chat and run.
but we'll be needing your car.
hand over agent Rivai first.
what, do you think we're stupid?
she's our only bargaining chip.
toss the gun.
drop it!
Kitt, you know what to do.
Yes, Michael.
you're really gonna regret this.
shut up before we shoot you.
Where're the keys? - there are no keys.
agent Rivai, protocol alpha, charlie, beta, seven.
copy that, Kitt.
you okay?
so what have we learned about relationships today, Kitt?
men and women are erratic, unpredictable, and irrational.
I believe I have learned nothing.
no, kitt, you've learned everything.
predictability takes all the fun out of a relationship.
in addition, I searched the municipal codes of every city in the United States.
there is no such thing as the make out rule.
what?
you told Zoe you can't park in a car at night without making out.
and that it's a rule.
well, it may not be in any database, but it's a rule.
trust me.
well, it's night, and you are both in a parked car.
rules are rules.
Really?
Mike and Sarah are approaching.
duck!
Hey. - Hey.
hear the news? - What?
congress quietly doubled our funding.
I wonder if that has anything to do with the charges being dropped against Nikki?
and poor Max is gonna rve20 to life.
what a boy won't do for a girl.
I was just thinking the same thing.
good-night.
good-night.
busted.
it's intense, what happens in the O. R.
when lives are on the line...
and you're poking at brains like they're silly putty.
you form a bond with the surgeons right next to you...
an unbreakable, indescribable bond.
it's intimate, being tied together like that...
you up?
no. -Yes.
whether you like it or not, whether you like them or not, you become family.
the wicked witch is dead.
metaphorically dead or dead dead?
who are we talking about?
her name is off the surgical board. Her surgeries have been canceled.
I don't know how or why, but I do know Hahn is gone.
that's too bad. She was really talented.
U're not talking to me.
is, uh, Grey home?
Yes. -Death?
come on. Where are you, death?
death?!
die! Oh, my god! -It's been-- forever.
you look like...
death! Death!
is the guy in the pajamas your boyfriend?
cause if so, then hot. -Right?
who are you? -I'm Sadie. Who are you?
I'm--I'm--I'm Cristina.
apparently they went backpacking around europe together or something... Before med school.
you know that woman all but kicked me out of the bed?
that's terrible. -And death?
Meredith's name is not death. It's Mer.
I really feel for you.
you know, she's never even mentioned this woman.
I mean, how good of a friend can she be?
good enough to kick us both out of bed.
welcome to my world.
this woman is the reason I went to med school in the first place.
I figured if a slacker like death... -Mer.
could handle slicing people open, then I could, too.
Meredith's not a slacker.
Ooh, I could tell you some stories. -But you won'T.
so, Sadie, you postponed your residency to work in a mor yeah, you know, a lot of the fun cutting, none of the rules, but I got bored.
started craving blood that was flowing.
and now you're here. I can't believe you're here.
iz, you coming? -Yeah. I just need a minute.
look, I get it.
Hahn's case brought up the Denny thing. But Hahn's not even here anymore.
it's stuff from the past.
stuff from the past, Iz.
you don't understand. -I might...
if you'd talk to me.
fine.
see you inside.
I'm walking. -Morning.
walking straight ahead, all by myself.
you know, you look good. Tired, but good.
did I mention I find the short hair kind of sassy?
now I'm turning this corner, again, all alone.
these are s--uh, scratches from my kitten. He's a crazy scratchy scratcher.
you're a cat person? -I meant hairbrush.
It--it--I have a crazy scratchy hairbrush.
solo surgeries are at stake here, three.
I can't have you acting weird or wounded.
I'm--I am on top of my game. Really.
I'm sending you to plastics, far, far away. Just go.
Hey, what do you know about a heart guy named dixon?
Dixon? Uh, no, not a guy. I've heard of virginia dixon.
she's got an incredible record. Really low mortal
wait. Is she coming here? -Yeah. Today.
piggyback heart transplant. I'm on the case.
what? What? W-why am I not on the case?
so she's your pre-cristina cristina?
you gonna tell me why she calls you death?
Oh, no. The adventures of dea and die are better left untold.
Hey, pedia's julienning her skinny little chickearms, and still no word on what made "h" hitch a ride with her flying monkeys.
later. -Translate that for me.
Lexie may be a secret cutter, and there's still no word on why Hahn quit.
is that true, about Lexie?
I don't know. How would I know?
if it's true, what are you gonna do about it? -Nothing.
Meredith, you can't do nothing. She's your sister.
And? -And you're family.
I'm not understanding. -Lexie is your family.
forget it.
Hello, Dr. Hunt. -Dr. Yang.
thank you.
Hey, what do we got? -Uh, crusinjuries.
couple minutes out.
Hey, w-what do you know about Hahn? -Um, she's gone.
Yeah, but why? -I don't know.
you two are friends.
I don't want to talk about it, okay? I want blood and guts and mangled bones.
I want a guy so badly smashed up, it takes all day to fix him.
I want to rock a surgery. I don't want to talk about hahn.
unidentified man with prolonged extrication time.
they had to fish him out of a working garbage truck.
multiple crush injuries, open fractures, G.C. S. 3, and we couldn't unhook him in the field.
unhook him?
his femur's broken in half, and it's puncturing his torso. He's impaled.
impaled on himself?
human pretzel.
that l do.
check his popliteal pulse.
I'm getting nothing. -That's because his knee is over here.
you think he was sleeping in that dumpster and they started crushing the trash?
that's a bad day.
Hey, I'm here. What did I miss?
okay, it's your first day. Why don't you just stand back and shut up?
breath sounds are clear and equal, both sides. Unbelievable.
so no punctured lung. We need a portable x-ray and an ultrasound.
someone paged us. -I did.
you did? That's a first. -So is this.
I've seen a lot of trauma-- guys cut in half, amputations, eviscerations
but I have never seen anything like this.
I wondered if you could help.
you hire when you're number 1, not number 12.
but I need you to be my ambassador today.
show DR. Dixon what seattle grace is all about.
I've thrown a lot of money, a big title and a lot of research dollars at her.
but... -but what?
she's a little different. She's a little off.
so we're wooing today, Bailey. -I can woo with the best of 'em.
so, what, Dixon is a nut job? -Excuse me?
I'm just saying, I've already had my quota of crazy for the year.
Hey, I've had my off days. You want to judge me?
you never even met the woman, Karev. Now you heard the chief.
our job is to impress DR. Dixon today, so be impressive.
I've got the chart for DR. Dixon. I'm ready to work.
I'm excited. -Don't be. She's off.
you okay? -Yeah.
all right. Heads-up. Here she comes.
Oh, Dr. Dixon.
welcome to, uh, Seattle Grace. We're very happy to h-have you here.
I'm--I'm Dr. Bailey. -I-I brought my own lab coat.
I'm here to perform a heart transplant today. I do hearts.
a procedure invented by Christiaan barnard in 1967. I do hearts.
uh, I--I'm Dr. Richard Webber. We spoke on the phone.
Karev, would you get Dr. Dixon the latest labs?
Stevens, let's prep the patient, please.
okay, then. She's a little off.
his femur's in pieces, I mean, except for the part that's stuck in his torso.
there's no way I'm saving that leg.
it looks like the impaled piece is lodged under his clavle.
c-spine looks clear. Without a C. T.It's hard to be sure.
and why can't we get a C. T. Scan?
the way he's impaled, it's hard to get a clear reading.
you know, there is such a thing as a stupid question.
stand over there. -Guys, guys, we have a very limited window here, okay?
with vitals like these, in a few more hours-- his body won't be able to withstansurgery at all.
good thing he's unconscious.
well, we can't do anything till we dislodge the femur from his clavicle.
okay, then let's unimpale him.
yang, Grey, new kid, hold his shoulders. Brace him hard.
I'll hold his c-spine. -I got his torso.
I need to guide the posterior hip dislocation.
the second that leg is out, be ready to assert pressure to stop the bleeding. Got it?
better thaworking on corpses, huh?
on the count of three.
one...
two...
three.
femur's really wedged in there. -Okay, push directly on the clavicle while I pull.
okay, almost there. Almost there. Steady.
just a little bit further. S-Sloan, I need you to, um, rotate his knee to my right.
push 10 of morphine now!
just get in there and hold the pressure.
okay, get his femur stabilized and down by his side.
corpses don't do that.
I need you to calm down, sir.
what are you doing to me? -Name?
get out of my face! Get your hands off! You're hurting me!
do as he says. Hands off, everybody.
but-- hands off.
thank you.
what's your name? -Timothy Miller.
Mr. Miller, w-we need to get you into surgery.
I'm gonna be able to walk, right? I gotta be able to walk.
right now, we're just trying to keep you alive.
our cardiac wing is extensive and well-equipped with all of - the first successful hearttransplant was performed on september 7, 1896, by Dr. Ludwig Rehn, Frankfurt, Germany.
okay.
uh, excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt.
uh-- please inter-- I mean, just, uh, please update DR. Dixon on theatient.
uh, Dr. Stevens is prepping your transplant patient for surgery.
they scheduled a-a-a transplant six years ago, but the heart was too small, so they doubled up and added a donor heart to help his own heart function.
they did a piggyback-- Heterotopic Transplant.
piggyback is the colloquial name for the procedure.
don't do that. don't do that.
how about we... take you to meet the patient?
they tell my heart belonged to a girl that was hit by a car while she was hitchhiking.
and now when I'm driving, I see hitchhikers all the time, always up ahead, just up ahead, but when I get up ahead, they're gone.
you're not buying any of this, are you? -I should never have gotten the heart.
I-I don't understand how the heart-- navajos--we don't even touch the dead.
we don't touch their bodies or belongings because the spirit clings there.
so to have part of a dead body sewed into my chest is...
my friends who follow the old ways, they begged me not to do it.
I should've listened. -I'm sorry. I don't understand.
you think you're haunted by your transplanted heart, but you're here for a new transplant.
No! That's what I'm trying to tell you. I don't want it.
I don't want the new one. I just want you to take the old one out.
wait. That's just plain stupid. Take the heart, man.
take the heart if they offer it.
did he just say he doesn't want the donor heart? -Yes, ma'am.
clay Bedonie, are you aware that without a new heart, you'll live a short life attached to a machine before dying a sudden and agonizing death?
see, that--that's what I'm talking about.
five parallel pulley stitches per cut, then switch.
you sure I'm numb? -Toughen up.
when one of our residents gets picked for the solo surgery, one of us gets to scrub in, so we have a goal here. Focus on the goal.
solo surgeries. Totally worth it.
solo... surgeries. Totally worth it.
Hello, I need someone to run these labs and pull these x-rays, please.
will do.
Hey, this looks like a cool place to hang out. What are you guys doing?
this is for internS. It's--it's our hangout. Go find your own.
sorry.
solo surgeries. Totally worth it.
I don't want to live if I can't walk.
we'll do our best to save the leg-- I'm homeless.
walking is how I survive. It's how I...get from one day to the next.
Marion street's safe from 2: 00 to 6: 00 A. M.
and then I go over the Half-Mast bridge, and I hang there till 6: 30 until the traffic hits.
and then I go over to belltown and hang out on the Waterfront.
and then the waterfront, if it's trouble, then I go back up to 4th street.
I'm homeless. I-I can't not walk.
I-I--what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
your injuries are critical. If we n't get you to surgery
will your surgery make me walk?
then I don't want it!
okay. All right.
you heard the man. The surgery's off.
I appreciate you trying to advise me to do what you think is best.
these are facts, not opinions.-What'm saying is
he's trying to say he would rather live a shorter life that's unhaunted than a longer one that is.
I'm not saying I agree. I'm just...
I'm just gonna stand over here.
that's a good idea.
the heart that you take out of me, what happens to it?
it goes from the O. R. To phology to medical waste.
I need that heart back for ritual.
we have laws. There are rules. Rules are rules.
maybe there's compromise to be made here.
uh, we could, I don't know, uh, give him back the old heart to do the ritual, then give him a chance to live by still putting the new heart in.
no. no.
it doesn't work that way.
I will still be haunted, just by a new ghost.
there are rules. We have laws, and there are-- rules are rules and laws are laws.
no.
so that's it? No surgery? You're just gonna walk away?
I'm respecting the patient's wishes.
the patient's unstable with an open wound. Which we are packing.
this guy is circling the drain. -You cannot just walk away.
don't tell me how to run things in my E. R. -Your E. R?
we save lives here. We don't just patch up patients and leave them to die.
if you can't handle that, go back the desert and leave us here to do our jobs.
Dr. Torres, please tell me you can figure out some way to build this man some legs.
well, the right femur's toast.
so is the hip and half the pelvis, but if I put some pins here and maybe a plate here...
I mean, there are some viable bone fragments. We're not starting from nothing.
what do you think? -I think it's wild.
all right, she wasn't talking to you.
it's her first day. Could you not be so
no, she's an intern. She needs to learn her place.
I think it's a lot of hardware. What the guy needs is a whole new leg.
well, maybe I can do that. Yeah, I mean, it's kind of a puzzle.
I just need to figure out what equipment I need and--and how to pull it off.
like Lincoln Logs. -Uh, it's a little more high-tech than that.
it's exactly like Lincoln Logs.
okay, I need you guys to grab every piece of titanium we've got in the hospital.
um, I need the hospil rules to specify the fact that we must respect all religious and spiritual beliefs of our patients.
the rules? -Yeah, I'm asking you to declare a rule of our department.
that we respect the beliefs of our patients? -Yes.
isn't that just common courtesy? -Yes.
then why am I declaring it?
Dr. Dixon doesn't do common courtesy, but she understands rules.
so if it's a rule, we're golden.
if not, we have a pissed-off patient an apoplectic surgeon, and none of those things makes for a successful procedure on a faulty heart, not to mention the failure to woo.
you want me to announce it as a rule.
I'm here's a witness, you can maybe raise your right hand, put your left one on the "physicians' desk reference.
it's a rule. -Thank you.
Dr. Dixon, I'm cristina yang.
I'm a resident here, and I've been focused on cardio since I began my internship.
I'm certainly looking forward to anything that you might
were the other ones taken off my case?
Oh, uh, what other ones?
the black one, the male one, the one with ylow hair.
not that I'm aware of. -Then why are you talking to me?
so-- what happened to Hahn?
wh-whatever made hahn leave, it can be fixed.
U-unless she a was fired. She wasn't fired, was she?
she's not coming back. -You don't know that.
she kinda does. -How?
because she doesn't...
look, it's just too...
we had a fight.
Oh, please. Meredith and I fight all the time. We still work together.
it's not like Hahn was your girlfriend or something.
Oh, my god. She was your girlfriend?
look, we hadn't... figured it all out.
wait, so are you a lesbian now? -I don't know.
maybe you were a once-bian.
or a twice-bian. Whatever. It's over.
are you okay? -She's fine. Leave her alone.
I hit the titanium mother lode.
Oh, come on. Really?
Hey, Lexie. How are you?
is, uh, everything going okay?
why, did somebody say something, like I was doing something?
no, I'm just, uh, you know, as, uh, I'm asking as a person who's sort of related to you if there's anything bothering you
so this is completely not as a boss or a resident or a superior keeping an eye on what I do as a student in this program?
no, no, I'm just a compassionate person, and I'm just wondering if you're channeling your tragic pain into, uh, self-mutilation.
are you a secret cutter? -No.
little grey, torres is, uh, trying to set a world record for most titanium rods used in one patient.
you in?
little Grey?
little Grey. Big Grey.
that's how I tell you two apart. -Yeah, I'm in. I'll just be a minute.
can't you people let a guy die in peace?
your, uh, vitals are slipping. I'm not gonna lie to you. That's not good.
I been through worse.
Yeah, I imagine you have.
Oh, don't get like that.
don't look at me like I'm some tragic hero with a secret past.
you have a story.
we all have a story.
I took a turn in my life. And I couldn't connect.
I lost...
I couldn't connect.
my life, it took a turn and...
and I just couldn't turn it back.
guys, we need to shut down for a few days.
people are starting to get suspicious.
I was accused of being a secret cutter.
so wear long sleeves.
Oh, I didn't realize we were inviting more people here.
are you kidding?
a secret intern society?
I'm all over that.
we, I still think we need to take fewer risks.
fewer risks? Come on. You got a guard at the door.
you're using more local anesthetic for three sutures than you would upstairs for a chest tube.
look, I get that you're doing all this to learn new skills, but you're only gonna learn so much by being careful.
uh, actually, I would disagree. I think the onlyafe way to...
who wants to stitch me up?
Oh, right here.
you gonna tell me about death and die?
Nope. But I did talk to lexie for you.
and now I need you to do something for me.
what's that?
I need you to tell Mark to keehis little Sloan out of little grey.
is he hitting on you? - No, not my little grey.
Lexie's little Grey. I don't know what's going on with her, but the last thing she needs is Sloan going all man-whore on her.
so you need to tell him to step away from little Grey.
all right. I'll see what I can do.
little Grey, Derek. Little Grey.
did she, uh...
she say good-bye to you?
Nope.
are you okay?
do I look okay?
you look great.
then I'm okay.
So...there's a 9-day ritual to--to undo a haunting?
it starts with a 9-day ritual. Okay.
are you really gonna waste nine days on this?
Dr. Stevens. - Yes.
why are you sonterested in my haunting?
Can...can ghosts do things?
I mean, can they make things happen in your life?
I--I've had two cases with two patients in a row that have really reminded me of my dead fianc?
heart transplants and l-vads and-- could he be doing that?
could he be bringing them to me?
Izzie, come on.
is he here right now, your ghost?
I...
I hate to ask, but...
Oh, you don't want me in your surgery.
it's not that I think there's something wrong with you.
it's just...
I don't need any extra ghosts in my operating room.
Mr. Miller. - What does a guy have to do to get a little peace and quiet around here?
the fatigue you're feeling is from the blood loss.
the queasiness, the dizziness-- it's because you're slowly bleeding to death.
what, are you trying to scare him?
no.
I'm trying to ascertain whether he's suicidal or just defeated.
Mr. Miller, you survived in the streets, so I know you're a fighter.
that doesn't make me a fighter.
it makes me lucky.
how long you been out there, 10 years, 20?
you're not in jail, you're not dead. That's not luck. You're smart.
you gotta be smart to take care of yourself on your own.
I guess. - This...
what you're doing right now, Mr. Miller, refusing surgery, it's not smart.
there's a rehab center not too far from here.
Medire takes care of it. You could stay there.
food, bed, long as you need.
just let us operate.
let us operate, and we'll figure the rest out.
that's the fastest I've ever seen anyone dissect through adhesions.
uh, Dr. Dixon, there is a rule, uh, regarding giving medical waste to the patient.
Dr. Dixon?
what?
uh, I was just saying there is a rule, an official, very, very specific rule, that in the event a patient asks for their organ or body part back for any reason related to or involving theicultural beliefs, we must respect that patient's wishes, and return that organ to the patient.
that is the rule I forgot to tell you about.
if I went down to pathology right now, would they know about the rule?
Oh, the chief would know. Uh, it's his rule.
he declared it.
a rule's a rule.
Dr. Karev...
make sure that...
we follow the chief's rule and return the heart to the patient after the surgery.
I'm going ck to work now.
clamp.
what the hell is that gooey thing they're taking out of him?
the silent treatment.
okay, if you're gonna be that way. I'll just, uh...
I'll just stand here and--and be quiet.
okay, but that...that is disgusting.
I thought you were gonna be quiet.
you know, you're acting like you don't want me to be here.
you know what I've wished for every day since you've died?
I've wished that I could see you again.
I'd have given anything just to see you...
one more time.
looking at you and knowing that I can't touch you, it's hurting me.
Izzie, you can touch me.
you're not real.
you can't be real.
so that means that I'm sick or something is wrong with me, and I can't hope for that.
I...
I can't hope.
you're not real.
Izzie, I am as real as you or that gooey, disgusting thing down there.
touch me.
touch me. I'll prove it to you.
No!
why are you here?
I am here for you, Izzie Stevens.
clamp.
okay, that's it.
the donor heart is separated.
we have the cannulas ready for bypass.
next step is the l.vad - y...what...what is that?
that's not right.
that can't be happening.
his heart's beating. How is his heart beating on its own?
it...can't be happening.
it shouldn't be happening.
that heart is beating.
that heart is beating. It shouldn't be beating. It sh-shouldn't be beating.
I've never seen a reconstruction like this. Well, I've never done one like this.
here's hoping it works.
all right. I'm ready for the rod. How are you guys doing up there?
a lot of hemorrhaging, bleeding through the packing.
try the fibrin sealant.
good call. Thank you, DR. Shepherd.
how you doin' on that lac, little grey?
good. Moving on to the next lac.
you finished already? Let me see.
pulley stitches.
nicely done.
thank you, DR. Sloan.
so my heart...
it started beating by itself.
if it continues to function like this, you won't need an l-vad or any other kind of machinery.
it's wonderful news.
it's very atypical.
not for me.
I'm finally free.
I'm not haunted anymore.
your heart had six years to rest, which is...
probably enough time for it to repair itself, which is why it started beating again.
I've never seen this before. I've read about it, but I've never seen it before.
you have your beliefs.
I have mine.
I don't have beliefs.
I have science.
science is a belief, a belief in only what you can see and touch.
I believe in more.
just thought I'd stop in to see how everything's going.
well, I'm still several hours away, but I may actually pull this off-- rebuilding a man's skeleton from scratch.
and we just found out that, uh, DR. Grey here can out-pulley stitch shepherd.
Oh, I wouldn't go so f as to say that.
excellent job, Dr. Grey.
and excellent job of teaching, Dr. Yang. - Sir?
taking the time to teach yo interns, and they are retaining that knowledge.
I haven't made my decision yet on the solo surgery, but you keep teaching like that, and you're my one to watch.
thank you, sir.
he's crashing. V-fib.
start C. P.R. Push 1 of epi and charge the paddles to 360.
clear.
thank you.
thank you so much.
so what do you do now with the haunted piece? Do you bury it or...
burn it.
actually, my tribe's medicine man will burn it.
I'm not allowed to even touch the smoke.
so does the not-touching thing, does that apply to just the flesh or no, we don't touch their belongings.
we can cleanse jewelry, medals, but fabric, bedding, clothes, books that were owned by the dead, we burn all of it.
spirit can cling to any of it.
Oh, no.
your ghost...
you still don't have anything of his, do you?
time of death--1922.
I built his bones.
you tried.
we all tried.
no, I didn't try. I did it.
I did my part. I built his bones.
I built his bones from scratch, and you...
all of you, you were supposed to keep him alive.
that is all you people had to do. You just had to...
keep his body breathing.
you just had to keep him safe and--and breathing and living until I made his bones.
I made...
I made his bones...until...until I made his bones.
I made his bones. I made his bones.
why don't you guys go ahead, and I'll help Dr. Torres clean up?
go call the morgue. - We've got it. Go.
everyone, clear out.
uh, excellent job today, Dr. Dixon.
excellent...
rule following.
I only have one real area of interest--the human heart.
I love it.
I like its regularity. I know everything there is to know about it.
I like its predictability.
it has rules. Every chamber has a function, every function has a movement.
I like the color.
it's comforting.
are you familiar with Ssperger's Syndrome, Dr. Bailey?
uh, of course.
a significant impairment during social situations...
I'm not good at cues like sarcasm or condescension, but I do know when I'm being manipulated, and I know when I'm being made fun of.
I don't think I like this hospital very much.
I don't think I like this hospital at all.
Ah, that Lexie Grey sure knows how to wrap herself around a suture.
mark, Meredith has some concerns.
well, that's not news. - About Lexie.
apparently Lexie is...
fragile, and getting involved with a superior might make her more fragile, so...
I was talking about her sutures.
keep little Sloan out of little Grey is my point.
what? - Little Sloan does not enter little Grey.
are we clear?- Did you just say
okay, that's just creepy and inaccurate.
big Sloan.
you heading home?
I love you.
I will always love you.
you own a piece of me.
so even though you'll be gone, you will never be forgotten, not by me.
I'm sorry we never got our chance. I'm sorry we never...
got to get married or have children or grow old together.
I wanted that so much.
I wanted to be your wife morehan anything.
why are you telling me this?
I'm trying to let you go so that your soul can be at peace.
but I have peace, Izzie.
I'm here for you.
good-bye, Denny.
I love you. But good-bye.
I can explain.
I did not teach you the parallel pulley stitch. I can barely do that stitch myself.
whatever you guys are doing, shut it down.
do not practice on yourselves. That is insane.
shut it down.
I see you.
I've seen you all day.
I-I see you struggling.
and I know you don't want my help, but let me help you.
whatever it is, I can help.
so let me.
will you burn this for me?
I hate how hard it is.
it's just, like, you get attached to someone, and then they work their way into your life, - and then you wake up one day - suddenly all you can think about is their little...
another round? - Oh, I'll get it.
tell me the stories.
what stories?
the ones you won't let Sadie tell me.
they're ancient history.
humiliating and ridiculous.
ridiculous is a grown man telling another grown man to stay out of a woman's little
you did it?
I did, those exact words.
I did it because...
it was nice to see you sticking up for your sister.
I did it for you. So now you owe me...
a story.
okay, fine.
but you can never tell anyone, ever.
I'm--I'm sorry we lost him, the patient. I'm--I'm sorry.
I don't need you to be sorry.
okay. - I don't need you to be sorry.
okay.- I don't need
all--all right.
the ties that bind us are sometimes impossible to explain.
they connect us even after it seems like the ties should be broken.
some bonds defy distance...
and time...
and logic...
Oh, god. I...I said good-bye.
I b-- I burned the sweater.
Yeah, thanks for that, by the way. I love that sweater.
you made me that sweater.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Izzie - oh, my god.
stop freaking out. - You're not reaL.
Hey, I told you...
you're not real. - I'm here for you.
you are not real...
Izzie, look at me.
touch me.
you see?
I told you I was real.
Oh, god.
meant to be.
not too bad at all.
Yes.

I'm so glad that you're coming back to help me with the hotel business.

no, sis.
I did pretty well on those resorts.
ain't it right?
but pretty well is not enough!
lift up your standard please.
and you treat yourself better please.
when I was young; whenever you smiled I would be delighted.
you know what?
since I'm back, this is the first time I see you smile.

I just want you to be happy, sis.

I'm afraid...
Really?

I'm jimmy Cheung.
my sister is on her way to your studio.
I don't care how you do it.
you have to make her stay and learn dancing.
kiddy, what're you talking about?
don't play phone tags.
my sister is Tina Cheung, the CEO of the Galaxy Group of hotels.
whatever!
check out your door, if you don't trust me.
Hello?
I'm his agent, talk to me.
if you can make my sister happy,
I can make you guys very happy as well.
what do you mean by happy?
give me your account number.
ma'am, wanna learn dancing?
what's your name?
we just met yesterday.
really, sorry... please come in.
boys and girls, take a break.
I'm Tina Cheung.
I've a Christmas ball by the end of the year.
I want Host, the best kind.
I want you to be my partner.
how much for a session?
3000
Mr. Lau, we've checked all studios' prices before knocking on your door.
once a champion only charges $3, 500.
my boss doesn't like to bargain.
but she doesn't like hypocrites either.
ma'am!
I don't give a shit about money. I'm an artist.
if you live up to my expectation, I'll still teach you for free.
wanna try?
give me your hand.
look at me.
good.
follow my footstep.
turn around.
good.
you never learn dancing?
never.
really looks good.
if you have never learned dancing, unless you're a born dancer...
surrendered.
don't waste my time... how much?
whatever you say.
reasonable, deal!
see you tomorrow.
Kam.
sorry, wait up.
I've given some thoughts to it.
I wanna change the direction.
I wanna group all talented students together.
in a group lesson instead.
I thought group lessons would harm my talent.
talented students together will bring positive affects to each other.
do you understand?
it's only $400 after all.
I understand!
then see you tomorrow.
good.
Mr. Lau.
just now...
this step... when can I do it?
very soon, tomorrow.
that soon?
the instructor doesn't sound good to me.
do you wanna change another?
Mr. Lau, the money has already transferred to your account.
why do you wanna see me still?
we decided not to teach your sister.
Why?
your sister is lack of talent. And her figure is bad.
her temper...
well, that's why we plan not to take her.
you can't ditch me now.
we won't cheat your money though.
we'll give you back the money.
this kid only wants his sister to be happy what do you think?

a bit more, a bit more will do.
alright, no problem.

you're the Toady King.
I'm Toady Pussy.
miss Cheung...

I don't care whether you're toady.
as long as you are rich, there is not a problem.

I'm a Toady Zombie.
I can't believe you're still here.

no, thanks.
aren't you hungry? No, not really.
I wanna ask you something.
go ahead, boss, what's it?
come on, don't call me boss. We're all the same.

do you think I'm taking advantage over you?
I think it's reasonable enough to do you favors.
did you cheat me on those Soul-catching shoes?
no, of course not!
that pair of shoes has been with me for over 10 years.
Oh...
you better treat it right. Sure...
is that it?
what do you think, about me?
you...
do you know... you're so charming?
very shining.
you lighten up when you dance!
not toady!
toady?
toady?
surely not!
when you dance, you lighten up the place.
you lighten up my life too.
you show me what dreams are like.
do you have a dream?
Yes.
what's it?
dance with you.

it's broken. It won't turn anymore.
some of my old birthday gifts.
Really?
Chuck it.
Chuck it? It's your birthday present!
Yes, do you like it?
Yes!

they're important. Don't forget it.
okay...
remember!

insane!
insane? Really?

I will be however toady I can, just for this championship.
smart, take care of Tina.

thank you!
brothers!
you're real nice!
this is not bad. Looks like a world champion.
there're lots of variations in dancing.
what variations?
world champion is the best.
whatever.
dummies gathering.
what are they laughing at all day?
they're happy. They laugh when they're happy.
happy? I haven't been happy for ages.
what?
I was thinking...
what are you thinking?
I can't think of it. Wait, other may think of it.
what are you talking about?
you talk as if you're mixing your disc.
don't think too much.
miss Cheung.
Mr. Lau isn't happy recently.
we're planning to have a barbecue party.

miss Cheung is coming as well. We shall have one more chicken!
I want pork!
chicken is better! Pork is better!
once I've waited
for my true love
hanging out in the street
I wish you are by my side
feel like when we first met
Tina, you're late.
he mimics jacky Cheung. Really well.
how well?
take this seat.
in fact...
I have to give my gratitude to someone who makes me who I am today.
and this is our honored guest.
let's welcome...
special guest furthermore.
I asked you to go home early
you told me you did not want to go
you asked me to hold you tight
a gust of sea breeze came
to blow out the burning flame
I saw you feeling upset
how could I afford to go?
even the eay you cried touched me
only I could kiss off your tears
let the wind continue to blow
never wanted apart
I always want
to be with you all the time
the wind continue to blow
never wanted apart
my heart broke into tears
yet holding back my tears in front of you
together we seek
for our past happy memories
I wish to wash away the pain
and recall our shared sweet moments
trying to hold back the tears
not letting them fall
feeling frustrated and stressed
knowing that we will be separated, tears betrayed me
I have brought you happiness
we're letting you go.
Why? -You're fat.
so if I was thin, I. I'd still have my job?
if you were thin, I'd probably try and have sex with you.
wait, no, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I've been damaged. We'll see you all in court.
she's not coming back to a firm of fat bigots.
are you this hostile in bed?
keep talking, Mr. Crane. All I hear is ca-ching, ca-ching, ca-ching.
you're fat.
off you go now. Take the man-eater with you.
my name is Leigh Swift.
and I am here today in hopes of securing legal counsel.
hello. -Hello.
would you like to get a drink with me?
you need to keep reminding yourself that this is a good thing.
no, it's not.
please don't use my name.
when you say my name, it reminds me who I am, which is Jerry Espenson, which is not a good thing to be at all in this situation.
okay, first, stop pacing. It's driving me.
stay!
you've had two wonderful dates.
and we all know what's supposed to happen on the third date after two wonderful dates, don't we?
you've really never kissed a wan?
not a real one.
well, it's actually quite simple.
you just move your head towards hers until your lips touch.
well, what about the tongue business? What am I supposed to do about that?
you just sort of.
slip it in and, you know, move it around a little.
Oh, well. Shouldn't you just write the book?
Jerry, the thing about a first kiss, the combination of the psychological and physical stimuli can be overwhelming.
it's best to separate the two.
that would be helpful if I had any idea what you said.
look.
you're standing at the door with your date.
Lorraine. -Alan, please.
you look into her eyes, you hold each other's gaze.
you're essentially kissing now.
not physically, but you're both saying with eye contact how much you long for the taste of each other's lips.
you moisten your own lips gently with your tongue.
a simple kiss now almost seems like nothing, and yet, it's everything.
because there is nothing so gentle as that first kiss.
Jerry left us.
it's only a kiss, man.
it's not just a kiss.
that's the thing about lorraine, it's never just a kiss.
she. I swear, she actually makes my tongue change color.
let see.
it's normal color.
not the tip.
it's bluish.
it's the normal color.
it's a bit puffy, though.
is it swollen? It's a bit puffy.
Oh, sweet.
it's the fat bigot and his friend Mr. Puffy tongue.
I don't believe we've officially met.
$1 million, nothing structured.
as I understand it, your client was offered her job back within an hour.
Oh, gee. You're right. You got me there.
$1 million.
I'm Alan Shore.
$1 million.
how about instead, I bite you on the inner thigh? Does that work for you?
if only I'd really said that, but you, of course, misheard me.
just as your client misheard Denny.
is that your defense?
he didn't really fire her for being fat?
miss. I'm sure you have a name, but I'm not much interested.
I've taken an immediate dislike to you. I'm sure you get that a lot.
where I was once prepared to be generous, now I'm not.
you've made the strategic mistake of pissing me off.
you scare me.
see me shudder?
take your clothes off. I'll make you shudder.
that I did say.
your hostility is just a barely concealed form of foreplay.
I knew it. You're a horny, insatiable little slut.
I could smell it the second you walked in.
well, I'm happy to oblige.
let's you and I make like rabbits.
I realize this is unbelievably late notice.
when does your trial start?
today, actually.
look, I-I just had a knockdown blowout with my lawyer.
now he's out, and I-I'm desperate.
let's back up. Uh, what is yo trial about?
I'm being charged with murder.
mm, something simple then.
look, I'm a police officer.
well, I was. They fired me.
I shot an unarmed man, mistaking him for a suspt.
I thought he had a gun.
turned out to be a soda can the light caught funny.
anyway, it was a mistake.
but the D. A.'s saying otherwise.
the thing is, they took an M.R.I. Of my brain.
Why?
the man I shot was african-american, and, uh, the district attorney's saying the shooting's racially motivated.
look, I had a couple of incidents at work where I had to go get, you know, sensitivity training and so forth, but I'm not a racist.
wait.
so they took a scan of your brain to see if the shooting was racially motivated?
Yeah, they called it a functional M.R.I.
I've read that they can evidently detect a predisposition toward racial bias.
and did it, with you?
Yes.
they plan to use it as evidence to convict me of second-degree murder.
well, you were worse than me.
I just.
I think she was prepared to he sex, though. I could've been right on the money there.
so now what happens?
well, she's noticed your deposition. After that, I'll bring our motion to dismiss.
I've been thinking a lot abt what you said, Denny.
Oh, I'm glad to hear that.
What'd I say?
you said that maybe Lorraine is the one for me.
maybe that's why I can't shake the neck or the kiss.
maybe I just can't shake her.
maybe Lorraine's it.
I said that?
what's the big deal, Jerry?
have you ever kissed a girl? -Yes.
as you or clevant?
I kissed claire as me.
I don't believe you. -I did.
hello.
hello. -Hello.
Clarence, I'm ashameto admit I've been googling myself again.
it happens when Shirley's out of town.
and I've been on youtube again.
do you know what's playing now?
that was not. oh, a minister?
a preacher?
are you a man dressed as a woman.
he stole my parking place.
I was getting ready to back in, then he whooshed in with his sports car, then he called me names and.
I just lost it.
you weirdo. you pervert.
Oh, you know what else you can do?
you can kiss my ass. That's what you can do.
take a look at this here.
Oh! Oh, his image, Mr. Minister.
kiss it! His image!
take a good kiss of that, Mr. Minister!
okay, several issues.
first, you're terrorizing clergy.
that's something we frown on.
second, you likened your buttocks to god's image.
very politically incorrect even in a blue state.
and you managed to do so on the world wide web as an employee of Crane, Poole & Schmidt, which means that your exposed ass only speaks to the almighty's image, but ours.
take that right there.
take a look at this here. Oh, his image, Mr. Minister.
I wasn't watching anything.
I expected better from you.
me?
your conduct leaves a little to be desired.
hello.
Leigh, hello. Leigh, hello.
I was just in the neighborod.
I thought, what the hey?
what a surprise. Hey. Hello.
this is clarence. You remember leigh.
hello.
hello.
all set for tonight?
tonight.
well, uh, something's come up, actually.
it looks like I have to work late tonight.
Oh, okay.
tomorrow night? -Yes.
well, this case could be consuming, this one that just came up.
maybe we should postpone till the weend.
Oh, okay.
good-bye.
good-bye.
what came up? Nothing's come up.
did I ask you?
you're just afraid you'll have to kiss her.
don't be such a buttinskyhead.
you hurt her feelings.
I said I didn't ask you, you.
poop!
all rise.
this court is now in session.
the honorable judge Gloria Weldon presiding.
be seated.
good morning, your honor.
Whitney rome along with katie lloyd of Crane, Poole & Schmidt for the defense.
your motion is denied.
I haven't even told you what it is yet.
you seek to suppress the M. R.I. Scan.
Mr. Bass' previous counsel already brought such a motion to suppress.
the issue was ruled on.
your honor, come on.
a brain scan to read his thoughts?
assuming these things are even accurate.
no.
it reads chemical responses, not thoughts.
and we already make suspects give blood, D.N. A.Handwriting analysis.
those are objective tests.
so is the brain scan.
I'm allowing it. What else?
we also have a motion for a continuance in denied.
wait, we just got this.
too late. Denied. We start today.
your honor.
maybe in the interest of justice, we should put our conflicts on the table.
Meaning?
meaning there may be some bad blood between you and my firm, and it.
Mr. Palmer, I once had a relationship with a lawyer at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.
do you object? -Not at all.
well, my client objects.
tell your client the affair wasn't very memorable.
and if I had to rese myself from every case where I'd slept with one of the lawyers, or both, I'd have to take up golf.
I'll give you one hour to get yourself ready, then I'm bringing in the jury.
okay.
listen to me, Denny, answer only what you're asked, do not throw in little, uh, comments or asides, and above all, do not, do not, do not offer your opinions.
will you relax, man? It's me you're talking to.
dear god.
I was just leaving.
I was just, uh, thinking about you earlier.
Really? Tell me.
well.
you know how, uh, both of us seem to be so relationship averse?
I was thinking.
maybe you are, uh, right for a longer-term thing..
funny.
who told you?
told me?
that I'm a relationship.
I was planning to tell you.
you're in a relationship.
Yeah, a really wonderful man.
I think you'd like him.
Oh, I'm s.
not sure.
anyway, I-I-I thought you'd be relieved.
we've decided to make it exclusive.
so you won't have to worry about me stalking you anymore.
terrific.
we had just came out the deli.
and B. J. Went back in because he forgot his soda on the counter.
I kept walking to the car.
B. J. Is your brother.
Yes.
then as I got to the car, this cop car comes screeching up, and two cops jump out, screaming.
and they had their guns pointed at B. J.
then what?
they just shot him.
he shot him.
he just kept shooting and shooting.
it was like he unloaded the whole gun.
I'm very sorry for your loss, Terrence.
when the police arrived and leapt from the car, what did you do, if I may ask?
I just hit the ground.
and did you actually see your brother get shot, or did you first hear the shots and then look up?
both.
I first heard the shots, and then I looked up and saw him getting shot.
thank you.
once again, tightly constructed answers.
there's no room for opinions, especially yours.
what's wrong?
nothing's wrong.
you're being surly. I can hear it.
I am not surly. -Yes, you are.
whatever it is, I. -nothing's wrong!
that hurt my feelings.
she's involved.
who?
Lorraine. She has a boyfriend.
I never liked her.
did she say who?
no, and I don't care.
hello. Welcome.
I'm very unsettled.
if you don't want to date me anymore, please just be honest with me.
I'm 44 years old, I've heard every excuse there is.
the last one said he got summoned for astronaut duty and had to rush off for the moon.
I'm sick of dishonest, disingenuous men.
and people wonder how I could end up with a utility box.
you dishonest man!
Hey, lady, I tried to let you down nicely, and you punish me for it.
what, I should have opted for cruelty?
what do yowant from me?
they even fight weird.
come on, Denny. Let's go.
we were responding to a call that a man matching the description of the suspect was seen going into the deli.
when we arrived, we saw Mr. Owens and his brother emerging.
we identified ourselves as police officers, drew our weapons and asked them to get on the ground.
then what?
well, I looked at Terrence, the younger brother, over by the car.
then I heard the shots.
I looked back to see my partner firing at B. J.
and yet, you didn't shoot. -No.
in fact, you said to the, uh, field investigation division that you thought the shoot was reckless.
I thought it was a quick shoot.
I never said it was racially motivated.
officer Payne, how long have you and the defendant been partners?
three years.
he's your friend. -Yes.
ever have reason to think that he's a racist?
no.
Really? You never complained about him?
when we were first deployed together, I didn't know him.
he made a few comments that upset me.
like he "only believed in busing for away games"?
his sense of humor is sometimes misplaced.
but he's not a racist.
the brother who was mistaken for the suspect.
did he in fact look like that suspect?
we only had a general description, but yes, he did match it.
and that suspect was reported as being armed and dangerous.
Yes.
thank you.
Ffirst of all, I apologize for embarrassing the law firm.
it's not like me to lose my temper like that, and.
I am very sorry.
uh, second, uh.
I sued them.
sued who? -Youtube.
it was wrong for them to humiliate me like that.
I'll represent myself but.
you don't really have a case.
what they did was wrong.
I can't let it go.
Clarence, certainly you've heard the saying, any man who represents himself has a drag queen for a client.
wait, no. That's not the saying.
let me represent you.
I agree, what they did was wrong. I'll help you.
you don't have to do that.
I want to, and, son, I'm very good.
all rise.
this court is now in session. The honorable judge Brown presiding.
be seated.
all right.
before we begin, some of you may or may not have noticed that I'm wearing protective heaear.
I sustained a small wound while gardening.
my doctor advised that I take conservative precautions until the stitches are removed.
please pay it no attention.
your honor, I think we can make this quick.
Mr. Bell is alleging defamation of character.
the footage depicts what actually happened, and truth is a complete defense to defamation.
this is silly.
we're also suing under right to publicity.
the plaintiff is not a celebrity. We get no value trading his name.
you get value trading on footage depicting him.
I direct you to Massachusetts law, chapter 214, section 3A.
I'm sorry.
I'm finding it very difficult to get past the helmet.
I am a superior court jurist, and I expect to be treated with the respect that goes with this robe.
I do not sit up here for your amusement.
even so.
judge, the video was aired without a context, so it does not represent the truth.
I'd like to hear exactly how he's been defamed.
you can read how in the complaint.
it is a fair request.
Mr. Bell, the footage fairly and accurately depicts what happened, doesn't it?
the helmet threw me.
and you just thought you had the right to fire her 'cause she was fat?
and still is.
I thought I had the right to fire people who jeopardize my health.
how does her weight jeopardize your health?
according to studies at Harvard. You've heard of harvard?
obesity can spread like a contagious disease.
that's not my opinion. That's Harvard's.
but I wasn't too fat for you to hit on?
Oh, no. Cause I like chubby sex. But I never asked you to dinner.
did you hear that?
I only heard ca-ching, ca-ching.
I have nothing against the chinese. -Denny.
so are you firing all thheavy people Crane, Poole & Schmidt?
well, I had to start someplace. I started with her.
ca-ching.
and let's just suppose, say, my client did agree to have sex with you.
too late. I've moved on.
would you have fired her had she not rejected you?
I fired her because according to the harvard studies, the social influence of fat people can be just as damaging as genetics.
I tried to explain that to your client, but her ears were too stuffed with twinkies.
on their way in or out, I couldn't be sure.
ca-ching.
what?
it's called functional magnetic resonance imaging.
what does it do?
you can tell what someone is thinking?
we can tell how someone is feeling, and we can specifically identify responses associated with sociopathic tendencies.
here, we determined the defendant was racist.
you can really measure this with accuracy?
extreme accuracy.
in this case, we showed Mr. Bass pictures of people from various races, and then we measured the response in the part of his brain that controls fear.
it's called the amygdala.
and what did it reveal?
officer bass perceives blacmen as threatening.
possible he would be more trigger-happy with a black man?
Absolutely.
how long have these tests been used to read people's minds?
they read responses, not minds, but the answer is a long time.
and here, they told you jeffrey bass fears black men more than white.
Unquestionably.
are you familiar with shooter bias tests, professor?
they're video games with white characters and black characters, and the characters reach for either guns or cell phones, and you're supposed to only shoot the ones with guns.
and do these tests reveal that white officers more readily fire on blacks than black police officers?
no.
shooter bias tests have generally concluded that, in this country, everyone shoots black people faster.
focus on the images. This should only take about a minute.
okay.
why are we doing this?
if our scan gets different results, then we can impeach the validity of theirs.
and he's seeing what we're seeing? -Yes.
I don't ink our scan is getting different results.
you can kiss my ass.
that's what you can do. Well, you're a weirdo.
take a look at this here. Oh, his image, Mr. Minister.
kiss that right there! His image!
take a good kiss of that, Mr. Minister!
outrageous.
Mr. Bell, the footage fairly and accurately depicts what happened, doesn't it?
Yes, but it doesn't tell the whole story.
have you gone out in public dressed as a woman before? -Yes.
in fact, you once joined an all-girls gym, isn't that correct? -Yes.
you recently signed up for a singing contest in drag. You've gone to work in drag.
but that moment, without a context, makes me look like.
you're a lawyer.
I am.
are you familiar with section 230 of the communications decency act? -Yes, but.
which expressly protects online services from defamation liability arising from material posted on their sites by individuals?
your honor, this was an extremely embarrassing event, aired worldwide on a web site, absent the context that occasioned it.
the footage depicts what happened.
so where's the damage?
your honor, think of it.
we've all had a meltdown or two mortifying episode of some sort.
typically we're allowed to live those moments down.
but now thanks to the internet, we can't.
suppose I taped you as justice bubblehead.
put that thing down.
how would you like to be defined. -Put it down this instant!
my point is, life's little embarrassing moments are now having far-reaching and more devastating consequences.
if the day has come that we are going to be publicly and globally shamed by our foolish missteps, then the laws of defamation should keep pace.
certainly when these tort laws were drafted, the legislators never contemplated.
I repeated my command to freeze.
this time he did, but then he started to raise his hand, and in it was a metal object.
I thought it was a gun, and I just reacted.
you know now he was probably raising his hands in surrender.
Yes.
but at the time.
I ought it was a gun.
do you work in a pretty tough neighborhood, Mr. Bass?
Yes, it's a gang neighborhood.
and have you ever been shot at before?
three times.
have you ever shot anybody, besides B. J.Owens?
twice hmm.
what color were they?
I patrol a predominately black area.
so the two you previously shot were black?
Yes.
and according to internal affairs' reports, one of the suspects was also unarmed.
I was cleared of any wrongdoing.
it was an innocent mistake.
another mistake? Well, have you ever mistakenly shot a white person?
objection. -Sustaine defence.
according to the F. M.R. I.You feel more threatened by black people.
why do you think that is?
it could be because statistically, blacks commit more violent crimes.
it could be because I been shot at three times by black suspects.
or maybe you just dislike black people.
no, I do not.
I'm not a racist.
but you shot him eight times.
Mrs. Owens. -You just shot him till he was dead.
you kept shooting and shooting and shooting! -Mrs. Owens, I will have you.
you murdered my baby! -mom, calm down.
you murderer! -Mrs. Owens, any more such outbursts, and you will be removed from this courtroom.
just let me do all the talking, Denny, every word.
do not even move your lips without checking with me first.
all rise.
you can't be serious.
Judas priest, she's the size of an elephant.
be seated.
okay, I'll hear from the petitioner.
no, before we get to that, your honor, uh, Alan Shore representing Denny Crane.
I-I have a-a motion.
let's hear it.
uh, your honor, uh, perhaps you are not the right jurist to be objective on this one.
what do you mean?
his tongue is tied for two reasons, judge.
first, it's puffy.
and second, it's a challenge for him to spin this.
Denny crane fired nancy wilding because she was fat.
it is bigotry in its purest, most evil form.
fat people in this country are subject to prejudice, emotional abuse and ridicule.
it starts on the playground, and it never stops.
this woman didn't get asked to her high school prom.
waiters and waitresses ignore her.
she's been denied housing, insurance.
airlines want to charge her double.
but nancy wilding didn't sit in a corner and feel sorry for herself.
she said,"hey, I'm gonna use my brain.
I'm gonna study.
I'm gonna go to law school."
and she did.
and she graduated near the top of her class, she passed the bar, she performed ably and successfully as a wyer, and where did it all get her?
fired for being fat.
somebody somewhere has finally got to say enough.
Nancy wilding is hoping that person is you.
I'll take it under advisement.
uh, wait, wait. You didn't hear from me.
I'll take it under advisement. I'll hear you before I read my ruling.
judge, I don't think that's how it's supposed to work.
whatever.
this is not going well, Alan. -You think?
she won't even hear our side.
hopefully she will before.
excuse me, Denny.
what are you doing?
I'm standing with my head up against a wall.
Yes.
Why?
I had a little row with Leigh.
I saw that.
much of the office did.
I think I was mean to her.
was I mean to her?
well, from my vantage point, you were very mean.
she was feeling hurt, extremely vulnerable.
she lashed out in pain, at which point you whipped out the wooden cigarette and thrashed her with it.
I just felt everyone staring at us and.
have you called her to apologize?
tried, but.
she's dating my clock radio, just to get back at me.
uh, I beg your pardon.
she has a crush on my clock radio.
I let her borrow it after the utility box was killed, and when I called to apologize, the two of them were headed out to a movie.
I'm not quite sure how to respond to that, other than to say, you've had two wonderful dates with this woman.
uh, you're at the precipice of kissing.
and it just seems wrong for her now to be dating your clock radio.
policemen do tough work, dangerous work in cities across this country that seem to only grow more and more dangerous.
that is a reality.
but here is another reality.
african-americans have been targeted disproportionately in both arrests and excessive force.
blacks comprise 13% of our population, yet 44% of our prison population.
and how many times do you have to turn on the news and see that yet another innocent, unarmed black man has been shot dead by the police before we say enough?
eight times, he shot him.
even his partner, who is also his friend, called the shooting "reckless."
was it an honest mistake?
Yeah, sure, like the last time he mistakenly shot an unarmed black man.
how many mistakes.
can we allow him?
do we keep tolerating these executions or not?
the victim matched the description of the armed suspect.
he raised his hand with something metallic in it.
it looked like a gun. My client reacted.
the district attorney did not offer even one witness to dispute that.
instead, he gave you a brain scan.
the police can now take our blood, our hair, our D.N.A.
they can make us give handwriting samples, voice patterns.
they can cck our computers to see what interests us, our gpses to see where we've been.
and today, they're introducing scans to show our feelings.
where does it stop?
and let's assume these M.R.I. S really can show that my client feared black people more than whites.
so what?
the law has to distinguish between thought and deed.
the supreme court is doing away with warrants.
our administration eavesdrops on all of us.
are we really going to allow this government to unleash the thought police?
are we that scared?
we must be.
because today, the prosecution is trying to convict a man of murder with nothing more than an M. R.I.
God help us.
it can't even keep proper time.
you even have a dishonest clock.
Hey, I'd really love to chat, but I'm running late for the moon.
I'm sorry, Leigh.
I didn't mean what I said before.
I'd love to keep seeing you.
just not in this lifetime.
I'm too odd, Jerry. I get it.
you're not too odd.
it's just, our two dates went so well,
I was afraid of the third date.
Why?
because I was worried I'd be expected.
to kiss you.
which I'd like to do, but it's all so terrifying, your being a real person and all.
there.
can we move on?
it went by so fast.
Jerry, I'm just as scared.
forget about kissing.
have y thought about how hard it will be for the two of us to hug?
all right.
all right.
first off, I will have no comment about my modified headgear.
truth is always a complete defense against defamation.
well, that's the law.
but I am mindful that 30-second video blogs. without the proper context.
do not always capture the truth.
I'm also mindful that we live in a video world now, where every tom, dick and harry with a cell phone is a de facto cameraman and via the internet, a-a distributor.
maybe the current tort laws do need adjusting.
but right now, as they are written, they offer no remedy to those who may be humiliated by this.
the case is therefore dismissed.
we are adjourned.
I'm okay.
sorry, Clarence. We tried.
Yes, thank you.
I think the best advice for all of us to remember is if you're out in public, assume the cameras are watching.
okay, then, I'm told we have a unanimous verdict.
the defense will please rise.
madam foreperson, what say you?
in the matter "of the commonwealth vs. Jeffrey Bass "on the charge of murder in the second degree, we find the defendant Jeffrey Bass not guilty.
no.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you for your service. You're dismissed.
we're adjourned.
thank you.
thank you so much.
get a job without a gun, Mr. Bass.
all right, I've made my ruling.
what? No.
you said you'd hear from me.
Yeah, I could predict what you'd say.
well, I'd like to say it just the same, your honor.
whatever.
your honor, uh, what Denny Crane did and said here was offensive.
it was cruel.
I'd go so far as to say indecent.
but every plaintiff has a duty to mitigate damages, and this woman was offered her job back within an hour.
that couldn't make her whole from the pain.
may I finish?
I hereby rule that. -No!
your honor, I agree with many of the things ms. Path said.
fat people are discriminated against, unfairly and pervasively.
it is unforgivable to judge somebody on physical appearance alone, especially in the workplace.
but what my client did here was not altogether wrong.
in fact, more employers should draw a harder line on obesity.
Oh, really?
Yes, because it doesn't just go to looks.
this goes to a serious health issue. -A serious health issue.
and frankly, it's inexcusable.
65% of american adults are obese.
it's one of the leading causes of death in this country.
the health care costs run about $117 billion a year.
and we just keep eating and eating and eating.
look at me. Look at.
the fast food companies keep proliferating.
portion sizes keep getting bigger and bigger.
candy bars and soft drinks.
and we keep getting fatter and fatter and fatter as if it's not killing us, and it is.
and given this new study at harvard, maybe what Denny did, uh, wasn't altogether out of line.
simply having fat friends can triple your risk of becing obese.
if this is true, judge, if obesity is contagious through social networking, then maybe all employers have a duty to their employees to weed out the heifers.
and maybe it's about time, uh, to put aside our inflated sense of political correctness and practice a little tough love with our friends and family.
say to a loved one,"you're fat."
tell a friend,"you look like a hippo on the verge of a heart attack."
shock them into going on diets, not just to save themselves, but possibly their friends and coworkers.
that's all Denny Crane was trying to say.
and perhaps he should be applauded for it.
you done?
Yes, your honor, it appears I'm quite done.
case dismissed. adjourned.
we won?
we won.
I still can't believe she ruled in our favor.
because you judged her by her appearance, that's why.
so did you.
maybe a little.
you know, Denny, since I've been your friend, I've gotten heavier.
you're blaming me?
well, that study.
since I've met you, I've gotten bigger.
you're the feed bag.
me?
you're the influence.
Oh, come on.
I don't believe that study anyway.
you don't?
think about it.
of course fat people have fat friends.
thin people don't want to hang around with them. They're too fat.
what?
you doing okay?
I don't know what you're talking about.
of course you do.
here's my philosophy on women, Alan.
Oh, god.
it's better to want something you don't have than have something you don't want.
now when it comes to you and Lorraine.
I can't have her.
exactly.
please don't reduce sleepover tonight?
no popcorn.
Oh, come on.
see? Bad influence.
well, how can you watch a movie without popcorn?
did you not listen to my closing, denny?
I never listen.
was it good? -It was good.
so stop sulking. -I'm not sulking.
well. don't even come over if you're gonna be like that.
maybe I won't then.
fine. -Fine.
9: 00?

please Leave A Message.
Mr. Rucker, This Is Will Gardner.
I'm A Partner At The Law Firm That Represents Your Wife's Company.

handprint On The Wall.
what's This?
looks Like The Rubber Nub From Under A Computer.
just A Guess.
lou: Oh, Boy.
is That The Babysitter?
Yes.
I-I Found.
she Was In My Bathroom.
I'm Sorry To Ask This, Sonya, But Our Investigator On The Scene Is Saying There Was Marijuana.
did Jason Smoke Pot?
no.
in College.
Why?
sorry, You're.
you Get That A Lot?
less So.
sorry, I'm A News Junkie.
your Husband-- I Heard He's Getting Out.
Oh, I Don't Know.
it Changes Day To Day.
I Hope He Does.
thank You.
which Floor?
Oh, You Just Pressed It.
Oh, You Work At Stern, Lockhart.
maybe You Know What This Is All About.
something About My Wife's Company?
sorry. Junior Associate-- I'm The Last To Know.
what's Wrong?

Mr. Rucker, Do You Have A Second?

maybe It's Something From The Bedroom.
check The Fireplace Poker Downstairs.
it's Missing.
but I Just Saw Her.
you Just Saw Her-- The Babysitter-- When You Picked Her Up?
Yes.
I Picked Her Up At Her Dorm, And I Drove Her To.
I'm In Trouble?
I'm The Last One That Saw Her.
they'll Suspect Me?
Yes.
Oh, My God.
then Why.
I Need To Go To The Police, Don't I?
I Just Spoke To Them.
I Agreed To Surrender You In The Morning,
but These First Few Hours Of An Investigation Are Always The Most Important.
anything Can Be Misinterpreted.
won't My Coming Here Be Misinterpreted?
unfortunately, It's A Risk We're Going To Have To Take.
this Early In An Investigation, It's All About Leverage,
and You Have The Right To Remain Silent,
so Our Leverage Is How Much Access We Allow The Police.
they Want More, We Want Less, So We're The Gatekeepers To You.
Yep.
we're Going To Have You Take A Polygraph, Mr. Rucker.
it's Not About Truth Or Innocence.
I'm Sorry, A Lie Detector Test?
Yes, I Need Information So I Know How Much To Let You Talk Versus How Much To Keep You Silent.
yeah?
they're On Their Way To You Now.
they're Not Going To Wait Till Tomorrow.
how Long?
20 Minutes, Ten If They Send Someone From Central.
you Have 15 Minutes.
here You Go.
thank You.
in About Five Minutes The Police Are Going To Burst Through Those Doors.
I Need You To Be On For The Next 48 Hours.
that's How Long They Have To Charge Him With Murder Or Release Him.
it's Now Going To Be The Most Crucial 48 Hours Of His Life.
if They Charge Him, Bail's A Long Shot And He Could Spend A Year In Prison Before He Comes To Trial.
even If He's Found Innocent, That's A Year Of His Life Gone, So These 48 Hours Are Gonna Be Like A Mini-Trial.
we're Gonna Get The Cops To Look Somewhere Else And Get Him Released.
okay?
I Rode Up In The Elevator With Him.
either He's The Best Actor In The World Or He Had No Idea This Happened.
okay, Good, It'd Be Nice If He Was Innocent.
it's A Better Hand.
come On, I Thought We Had An Agreement.
yes?
Mr. Rucker, You Are Under Arrest For The Murder Of Lisa Pruitt.
you Have The Right To Remain Silent.
anything You Say Can And Will Be Used Against You In A Court Of Law.
easy, Easy.
you Have The Right To An Attorney.
if You Can't Afford An Attorney --Jason!
ma'am, No, You Need To Step Back.
okay, Here We Go-- 48 Hours.
the Panic Alarm Was Triggered From Inside?
yeah-- Yes, Ma'am.
so The Alarm Wasn't Triggered From Someone Breaking In.
it Was Triggered From Someone Already In?
Yeah, That's Why They're Thinking The Husband Did It-- Because He Could Disarm The System.
and Who Else Can Disarm The System?
who Else, Uh, Besides Mr. Rucker?
Yes, Mr. Horner.
well, Uh, Housekeeper And Lisa The Babysitter.
miss Pruitt? --yeah
what?
you Said "Lisa.
Yeah, Lisa Pruitt. Why?
what's The Housekeeper's Name?
I Don't Know.
but You Know Lisa's.
I Try To Be Observant.
hmm, Selectively Observant.
you Can Also Disarm The Alarm System.
it's Not Just The Housekeeper And Lisa The Babysitter, Is It?
I Don't Think I Want To Answer Any More Of Your Questions.
you Don't Need To Answer Any More Of Her Questions.
so.
did You Find The Murder Weapon?
the Poker?
Yeah, It's Right Outside The Door, Right Where The Husband Dropped It.
the Husband?
Yeah.
and How Does That Play, Tony?
he Lets Himself In, Tries To Rape Her, She Resists, He Kills Her.
steals The Missing Red Purse, Triggers The Alarm On The Way Out, Make It Look Like A Burglary.
see, I'm Liking The Security Guard.
Oh, You're Such An Unbiased Observer.
guard Sees The Babysitter, Wants Her, Lets Himself In, Disarms The Code,
tries To Rape Her, She Resists, Then Steals Her Pretty Red Purse,
triggers The Alarm On The Way Out To Make It Look Like A Burglary.
husband Lost His Job As A Cartoonist Two Months Ago.
now He's Sitting At Home Playing Mr. Mom While Wifey's Out Making An Internet Fortune.
that Hubby Needs To Reassert His Manhood.
Hey, Listen, I'm All For Dime Store Psychoanalysis If It Helps Me Close A Case.
just Keep An Open Mind For The Security Guard.
my Mind Is As Open As A Field Of Poppies.
you Look, Um.
content.
you Know, Sometimes The Fog Dissipates, The Rain Disappears, And Everything Makes Sense.
you've Made A Decision? --I Have.
Alicia Around?
uh, No.
so, You Know The Offer You Made?
what Offer Would That Be?
freedom Today If I Don't Fight The Conviction, Stay Disbarred, Can't Run Again.
Yes, That Offer.
smart Move Would Be To Take It.
so I Have To Imagine You're Going To Tell Me To Go To Hell.
you Want The Longer Version?
can't Wait.
I Wouldn't Get Too Comfortable In That Office Of Yours.
I'm Gonna Testify.
would It Help If I Told You That That's A Mistake?
look, If I End Up In A 12 By 12 Cell For The Next Nine Years,
I Just Want To Know That I Did Everything I Could.
will You Call Alicia For Me?
no service
I Liked Her. I Wouldn't Hurt Her.
so, You Were At The Movies?
Yes.
legend Of Condor Hero. It's A Wuxia Movie.
A.
wuxia?
wire Fu.
chinese Flying.
Oh, Like Crouching Tiger?
sorry.
they Play Them Every Thursday Night At Armour Square, Chinatown.
and You Have The Ticket Stub?
no, I Threw It Away.
you?
okay, So We're Gonna Have To Find Someone Who Saw You There.
Wuxia, Wuxia.
Cary, Can I Talk To You For A Second?
are You On Something?
Cary: No.
I Like You, Alicia.
I Like You, Too, Cary.
I Need You To Pull It Together Now.
okay.
okay, Here We Go.
pulling.
I Showed You His Lie Detector Test.
a Partial Test You Conducted.
by A Top FBI Polygraphist, And He Was Passing With Flying Colors.
then Let Me Question Him.
with Conditions.
I Could Charge Him Right Now.
then Do It.
what's Stopping You?
you Don't Have Enough.
I Want Two Of My Lawyers To Stay With Him At All Times.
they Have The Freedom To Consult Him With The Camera Off.
and I Want 15-Minute Breaks Every Hour.
no Food?
pizza.
in One Hour.
he Is A Little Creepy.
walks Around Like He's Saving The Neighborhood.
you Know What?
we Had A Break-In Right After He Started Six Months Ago.
Really?
what Did They Take?
that's The Thing.
just Some Money From Our Bureau, Some Clothes From My Closet And Popsicles.
popsicles?
Yeah.
I Think He Did It Just So He Could Come And Take A Report, You Know?
same Thing With Three Other Houses In The Neighborhood.
it's Just Creepy.
then What Did You Do?
well, I Dropped Her At The House.
I Made Sure She Had My Cell Number, Then I Went To The Movies.
did You See The Security Guard Anywhere Near The House?
the Guard? Sure He's Always Around.
you Seen Him Around Much When You Dropped Off Lisa Pruitt?
I Guess.
Yes, Thank You, Mr. Gardner.
we're Following All Leads.
Really?
Yes.
because I Know You Have An Unoccupied Interrogation Room.
so, Very Simply, You're In Jail Now Because You Dp'd Cases, Is That Right?
it Is.
could You Explain?
well, Dp Means Declining To Prosecute.
and What Cases Did You Decline To Prosecute?
uh, Investigations Into Allegedly Corrupt Real Estate Practices.
what Was Happening Is That Speculators Were Buying Depressed Properties On The Land Near Where Olympic Stadiums Were To Be Built.
why Did You Stop These Investigations?
they Sound Promising.
for A Very Simple Reason-- Lashkar-Etaiba,
which Is A Jihadist Extremist Group Believed To Be Active In Chicago,
allegedly Involved In Last Year's Attacks In Mumbai.
and The Fact Of The Matter Is, Is I Pulled These Investigators From These Other Cases
because I Believed That The Pursuit Of These Extremists Was More Important.
in Fact, There Was An Arrest In October?
that's Correct.
that Would Be David Coleman Headley, Allegedly A Key Member Of Let.
so.
why Didn't You Testify To All Of This At Your Trial?
I Should Have.
but There Was A Larger Consideration.
a Failing In My Personal Life Was Being Used Against Me.
I Wanted To Protect My Family Against Further Hurt.
I Knew That I Couldn't Testify About These False Corruption Charges
unless I Was Then Willing To Testify About.
my Life.
thank You, Mr. Florrick.
Mr. Landry, Your Witness.
actually, My Witness, Your Honor.
um, Your Honor?
objection.
on What Grounds?
Mr. Childs, You're Not The Judge Here.
apologies, Your Honor.
uh, Mr. Childs Is Instrumental In The Matters Directly Under Consideration Here, Your Honor.
those Are The Grounds.
but Mr. Florrick Is Such A Great American Hero.
your Honor.
and Has Been Instrumental In The Defense Of Our Great Nation.
your Honor!
surely He Wouldn't Mind A Few Softball Questions.
my Goodness, The Sarcasm Is As Thick As Butter Here Today.
I Don't Mind Being Questioned By Mr. Childs, Your Honor.
in Fact, I Welcome It.
well, Then, Let's Take A Short Break For Lunch, And Pick Up Right Where We Left Off.
she Was Selling Drugs.
I Bet It Was A Drug Deal Gone Bad.
come On, You Don't Know That.
I Knew Her Better Than You Did.
look, I Think It Was That Guy From The Neighborhood Where She Babysat.
she Always Said He Was A Nuisance.
Hi.
excuse Me, But Do You Guys Have A Minute?
Yeah.
sorry. I Have To Go To Class.

it Was The Dad That She Was Working For.
um, What's His Name?
burkle, Or, Uh, Rucker.
she Said That He Was Getting Too Close.
making Her Uncomfortable.
they Were Working On Something Together, Some Project, And She Said She Was Gonna Quit.
so, Um, Do You Want Me To Make A Statement Or Something?
we'll Call You, Okay?
all Right.
Yeah.
look, Um, Not Right Now, But Maybe You And I Could Meet Up Later, And I Could Take It Down Then.
so, You Threw Away Your Ticket Stub. Is That It?
Yes.
okay.
and This Chinese Movie-- What Was It About?
legend Of The Condor Heroes?
it's About Two Sons Learning Martial Arts In Mongolia.
sounds Exciting.
you Know Chinese?
Chinese? No
then How Did You Understand It?
that's Odd.
let's Take A Break For A Second.
Yes.
let's Do That, Mr. Gardner.
detective? The Camera.
what's Going On?
it Has Nothing To Do With This.
Mr. Rucker, You Don't Understand.
the Decisions You Make Right Now You'll Regret For Decades If You Don't Make Them Right.
Cary: Yeah.
look, I Just.
you Don't Know What It's Like To Be Out Of Work, To Be Stuck At Home.
I Do.
so Tell Me.
I Have A Place To Work, To Do.
but. But Just On Spec. I'm Not Being Paid.
and You Do This Work At An Office?
that's Where You Were?
you Weren't At The Movies?
Yeah, It's Just A Studio To Draw.
it's Nothing. It's The Size Of A Closet.
will: And Lisa Pruitt Was Working With You?
our Investigator Is Talking To A Friend Of Pruitt's.
she Did Some Writing For Your Graphic Novel?
Yes.
were You Sleeping With Her?
no.
so, What's In The Studio?
what's In There That The Police Might Misunderstand?
I Don't Know.
has She Been There?
has Lisa Been There?
Yes.
once.
look, I Didn't Say Anything 'Cause I Knew How It Would Look.
so, Where Is This?
where Is This Studio?
what Do You Have?
looks Like Your Client Had A Little Love Nest.
just Found Out About It On The Victim's Computer.
you Know The Security Guard Had Priors For Selling Dope?
dope? -yeah
and A Hero Complex.
that's Fascinating. Keep On That.
there Are Three Unexplained Burglaries In The Last Six Months.
all On The Same Nights The Security Guard Worked.
damn.
I Just Sent Alicia Off To Check It Out.
she's Got About Ten Minutes.
okay. Calling.
Alicia, Where Are You?
I'm, Uh.
looking For The Key.
didn't He Say It Was On A Pipe?
Yes, And, Not To Put Too Much Pressure On You, But The Police Are On Their Way.
on Their Way Here?
Yes.
they're About Ten Minutes Behind You.
now, It's Not A Crime Scene, So You're Fine To Inspect And Take Anything You Want.
anything I Want? What Are We Saying?
I Have The Key.
look.
look, I Don't Know What You're Going To Find In There,
but Until The Police Declare It A Crime Scene,
you Can Preserve For Our Uses Anything You Find.
has Jason Said Anything?
no, But The Police Could Misunderstand Something They Find.
and Kalinda Thinks The Security Guard Is Heating Up.
here's Something She Wrote.
a Short Story.
okay, I Think We Could Use That.
there's A Blonde Hair In A Brush.
what Do I Do?
is It A Long Hair?
Yes.
take It.
no Hair In The Drain.
Thanks. Good
there's A Bra On The Towel Rack.
one Second.
they're Here.
Thanks.
you All Right?
I Think So.
you Were Well Within The Law.
well"?
you Were Within The Law.
I Know It Feels Like We're Playing A Game Sometimes,
but We're Not Here To Pursue The Truth.
we're Here To Defend A Client.
and If He's Guilty? --Then, He's Guilty.
truth Is Above Our Pay Grade.
who's With Jason Now?
take A Few Hours Off.
get Some Lunch Or Something.
are You Going To Go Back To Help Cary?
Yes.
go.
get This Off Your Mind.
she Telling Her?
Yep.
that Can't Be A Fun Conversation.
Nope.
why Do You Not Look Surprised?
you Knew He Had A Studio?
no, But.
every Marriage Runs On A Few Secrets, Diane.
men Need Their Caves.
did You Know He Was Working With Her On Writing A Graphic Novel?
no.
I Knew Something.
it's Been Hard For Him Since He's Been Out Of Work-- For Me To Be The One Earning The Money.
so, Did You Ever Think That He And Lisa.
why Do I Suddenly Feel As Though I'm Under Suspicion?
Sonya, The Question Is Going To Be Asked.
if There's Something That You Want To Tell Me, Now Is A Good Time.
no.
well, Then.
is He Innocent?
of?
hurting Her?
Yes.
Yes, He's Innocent Of That.
but Sleeping With Her-- He's Not Innocent Of Sleeping With Her?
I Don't Know.
is There-- Sonya, I-I Hate To Do This, But Jason Isn't Being Up-Front With Us
is There Anything That Would Lead The Police To Believe That He Is Guilty?
there Might Be.
let's Start With The Easier Questions, Shall We?
how Many Times Did You Sleep With This Prostitute, Amber Madison?
objection, Your Honor.
sex Is Not Relevant To My Client's Guilt.
Mr. Florrick Was Sentenced For Dp'ing Cases In Trade For Sexual Favors,
so Sex Is Entirely Relevant To His Guilt, Your Honor.
the Fact Of The Sex Is Relevant, Your Honor, But Not The Minutia.
then I Will Endeavor To Discern The Minutia.
you May Continue, Mr. Childs, But, Oh, So Carefully.
how Many Times Did You Sleep With Amber Madison?
well, Just To Be Precise, Mr. Childs, By "Sleeping With"" You Mean "Having Sex"?
Yes. Thank You.
and Just To Be Even More Precise, By "Having Sex," I Will Also Include Oral-Genital Contact.
18 Times.
18 Times.
and Would You Classify Any Of These As Oral-Genital Contact?
objection.
minutia, Mr. Childs.
thank You, Your Honor.
now, Were These Assignations With Amber Madison.
were They In Hotel Rooms?
Yes.
all 18 Of Them, You Were In A Hotel Room?
to The Best Of My Memory.
well, Let's See If We Can Refresh Your Memory.
did You Ever Sleep With Amber Madison At Your Home While Your Wife Was Away?
objection.
your Honor, The Defendant Has Made It Very Clear
he Believed He Paid For These Various Hotel Sessions With Amber Madison.
we Just Want To Be Clear That These Were The Only Sessions.
overruled.
so, Mr. Florrick, Did You Ever Sleep With Amber Madison At Your Home,
in Your Bed, While Your Wife Was Away?
no.
and You Know You're Under Oath?
Cammy, Let It Be Stated That I Know I'm Under Oath, And I Know That mr. Childs Is Trying To Catch Me In A Perjury Trap, And Yes, My Answer Is Still No.
thank You, Mr. Florrick.
no Problem.
she Set Up A Nanny Cam In The Living Room To See If Her Husband Was Sleeping With The Babysitter.
well, Would've Been Helpful To Know.
Yes.
more Secrets Than An O'neill Play Here.
it's In A Digital Clock On The End Table.
I'm Not Sure I'm Going To Be Able To Get In.
do You Want Me To Tell The Police?
no. I Don't Know What's On It.
Sonya Says There's A Key Under The Mat By The Front Door.
right.
let Me See What I Can Do.
Oh. Does She Have A Laptop Case With Her?
Yes.
Why?
when You Get A Chance, Check And See If One Of The Rubber Nubs On The Bottom Is Missing.
any Particular Reason?
the Police Think It Was Used To Knock Out The Babysitter.
miss Sharma?
process Server.
you've Just Been Subpoenaed.
which Case?
Florrick's Appeal.
have Fun.
I'm Not Testifying.
then You're Going To Jail.
look, I've Got Nothing To Offer.
you Have Everything To Offer. You Know You Do.
Peter Florrick Lied On The Witness Stand.
tell The Truth, He Spends The Next Nine Years In Prison.
Glenn. --What?
don't Do This.
come On, Kalinda. What Do You Care?
you're Out For Yourself.
you've Always Been Out For Yourself.
and Either Way, You're Going To Tell The Truth.
you Don't Know That.
I Know That The Sun Is Coming Up Tomorrow,
and That You Are Going To Tell The Truth On The Stand And Florrick Is Going Back To Prison.
end Of Story.
you Okay?
Yeah.
what Time Is It?
midnight.
how Long Have I Been Here?
day And A Half.
I Was Freaking Out.
Yes, I Know.
did You Tell Will?
what, That You Were Freaking Out?
no.
Why?
it Was A Friend Of Mine From The Peace Corps.
I Thought I Had The Day Off.
Cary, I Didn't Tell Him.
why Didn't You?
with The Contest, You Know, Why-Why Didn't You Tell Him?
I.
there Are So Many People Lined Up Against Us, I Just Don't Want One More.
I Don't Want You To Lose.
I Know.
I Don't Want You To Lose, Either.
I Kind Of Like You.
I'm Surprised, But I Kind Of Like You, Too.
Ah, I Can't Help It, You Know.
being Competitive-- It's Just Me.
Oh, No, No, No, No, No.
not The Scorpion And The Frog Story, Please.
the Scorpion On The Frog's Back.
Yeah, I Hate That Story, Too.

because It Excuses People's Behavior.
how's He Doing?
you Don't Want To Know.
try Me.
what?
so, You Were At The Office All Night Until You Got A Call From Security About The Silent Alarm?
Yes. why?
you Didn't Go Home Before That?
no. Why Would I?
our Investigator Checked The Nanny Cam.
it Hadn't Been Turned On.
Oh, Well, I Must Have Forgotten That Day.
Yes.
we Thought Only Four People Could Disarm The Security Alarm-- Jason, Your Housekeeper,
the Babysitter And The Security Guard-- But We Forgot, You Could, Too.
Yes.
Why? What's Wrong?
we Found A Notice Of A Failure To Deliver A Package To Your House.
our Investigator Checked With The Company.
you Signed For A Delivery.
at 7: 30 P. M.
when You Said You Were At Work.
I-I Didn't Do It.
okay, So What Were You Doing At Home?
I Was Jealous.
I Thought Jason Was Sleeping With Her.
I Came Home To Surprise Them.
And?
he Wasn't There.
she Was There, Reading To The Girls.
I Left Embarrassed, Intent On Never Being Jealous Again.
and That Was It?
that Was It.
can I Check Your Laptop?
Why?
please.
tired?
tired Doesn't Even Begin To Describe It.
okay, So Here's What We Need To Do.
build A Chinese Wall.
Yep, And You Can't Tell Me What She Said.
complete Separation.
you Represent Jason.
I Represent Her.
each Has A Strong Motive, And In About 12 Hours, One Of Them Is Going To Be Charged.
so, We Can't Talk To Each Other Anymore.
understood.
good Luck.
you, Too.
one Of Us Is Going To Come Out The Winner Tonight.
I've Been Subpoenaed.
to What?
your Husband's Trial.
why Would They Subpoena You?
I Know Certain Things.
well, That Doesn't Sound Good.
are You Going To Tell Me?
do You Want To Know?
I Don't Know.
Oh, God, I Don't Know Anymore.
the Truth Seemed So Simple-- Lying, Not Lying.
do You Want Him Out?
I Just Want Things To Stop Spinning.
you're Right, I Don't Want To Know.
stay Away From Court Tomorrow.
Oh, Yes, Thank You For Getting Back To Me.
so, Lisa Pruitt Would.
I See.
right.
well, Thank You.
what?
that Was This Lawyer.
I Found It Near The Belongings Of The Victim In Rucker's Studio.
lot Of Lawyers Running Around This One.
I Don't Even Know Who We're Defending Anymore.
it's Gotten Very Confusing.
Yeah.
the Lawyer Wouldn't Tell Me If Lisa Pruitt Had Been In To See Her.
of Course Not.
that Would Be Too Easy.
but She Did Tell Me What Kind Of Work They Do.
matching Pregnant Women With Families Who Want To Adopt.
detective, I Need You To Stop Interrogating My Client And Step Out.
I Was Just Asking A Question.
you Can Finish Later.
please.
what's Wrong?
you Got Her Pregnant.
she Was At Your Little Studio.
no.
what? No
she Went To A Law Firm For Adoption.
tell Me Now Because They're Going To Find This Out During An Autopsy.
you Got Her Pregnant.
no, I Couldn't Have.
she Was At Your Studio.
Yes, I Know, But I Didn't Get Her Pregnant.
tell Me The Truth.
I Couldn't Have Gotten Her Pregnant. I Had A Vasectomy.
I Was Wondering When You Were Coming Back For That Statement.
Yeah, I'm Sorry I'm So Late.
a Couple More Questions Came Up About Lisa Pruitt.
she Ever Mention Anything To You About Being Pregnant?
who Said That?
Oh, Her Lawyer.
she Was Contacting A Law Firm About Putting A Baby Up For Adoption.
Yeah, She Told Me.
she Say Who The Father Is?
who She Babysits For-- Rucker.
Really?
Yeah.
that's Why I Think He Did It.
killed Her.
he Wanted Her To Have An Abortion, She Said No.
did She Tell You That?
he, Uh, He Didn't Want To Be Pinned Down.
you Know, This Is.
this Is All Very Helpful.
you Want Me To Say The Same Thing To The Cops?
can You Come With Me Now?
just-just Give Me A Minute.
sure.
what's Wrong?
nothing.
miss Sharma, The Defendant Fired You From The State's Attorney Office, Didn't He?
Yes, He Did.
now, In Your Own Words, Could You Explain Why He Did That?
he Said I Was Working Two Jobs.
and Were You?
Yes.
so You Were Working For Him, And You Were Working For.
you.
and What Kind Of Work Were You Doing For Me?
I Was Running Down Bimbo Eruptions.
would You Please Explain That Colloquialism?
your Honor, Again, We Object To This Line Of Questioning.
your Honor, This Is Our Last Witness.
we Ask For Some Leniency.
granted. Overruled, Mr. Golden.
what Were Bimbo Eruptions?
you Were Worried That Lawyers And Judges Were Being Co-Opted By Powerful Forces Who Used Prostitutes To Blackmail.
and When You Started This Task Force,
you Discovered That Mr. Florrick Was Involved With Amber Madison.
would You Please Explain How She Was Used To Co-Opt Mr. Florrick?
a Procurer Assigned Specific Prostitutes To Flatter And Pursue Certain Clients.
and The Clients Were Referred To By Number.
for Example, One Of The Clients Was Referred To As Client 12.
and What Did These. These Women Do?
these-these Prostitutes?
they Would Discover The Marital Status And Sexual Predilections Of These Clients.
to Use The Example Of Client 12, Um,
he Was Found To Be A Judge, A Married Judge, With Three Daughters,
and He Was Deemed To Be Interested In African-American Prostitutes,
and The Imagery Of Southern Plantation Life.
okay.
once Mr. Florrick Was Involved With Amber Madison, No Money Exchanged Hands, Isn't That Correct?
Yes, That Is Correct.
and If A Client Tried To Pay, A Procurer Would Refund The Client's Money.
like When Client 12 Tried To Pay For An Evening Out With Two African-American Women,
that Money Was Refunded.
miss Sharma, You Don't Need To Refer To A Particular Client.
just Answer My Question.
but I've Been Asked To Answer In My Own Words.
these Are My Own Words.
right, Your Words Could Be A Bit More On Point.
now, Did Mr. Florrick Have Sexual Relations With Amber Madison At His Home?
to Answer That Question, I Need To Talk About My Job,
and How Important It Was For Me To Know The Names Of All The Clients, Including Client 12.
I'm Here Under Subpoena, Mr. Childs.
if I'm Asked To Name The Names Of The Clients, I Must.
right?
um, Your Honor, Uh, Again, We Object To This, Uh, Sexual Line Of Questioning.
it's-it's Irrelevant, Just Like The Names Of These Clients Is Irrelevant.
we Respectfully Submit That This Is Beneath The Dignity Of This Court.
I Would Tend To Agree, Mr. Golden.
surely, Your Honor, There Is A Way To Elicit This Testimony, Possibly In Chambers?
not Without These Clients' Names Becoming Part Of, Uh, Public Record.
isn't That Right, Miss Sharma?
Yes, I'm Afraid So.
judge: I've Given Too Much Leeway To This Sexual Testimony, Mr. State's Attorney.
now I Must Call It To A Halt.
your Honor.
no, Sir.
it Is 4: 00 P. M.
and I Find Myself Unpersuaded By Your Arguments Of Mr. Florrick's Guilt.
I Believe This Was Nothing More Than A Sexual Witch Hunt.
but That's Not For Me To Decide.
my Job Is Merely To Determine If There Is Enough For A New Trial,
and I Believe, Mr. Florrick, There Is.
I'm Sorry, Mr. Florrick.
I'm Sorry This Has Happened To You.
and I'm Sorry I Don't Have The Power To Do More Than Order A New Trial.
but That Is Exactly What I'm Going To Do.
you, Mr. Florrick, Have Been Granted A Retrial.
Yes!
the Kid From The Dorm Was Right About The Motive.
it Was Just His Motive, Not Jason's.
she Wouldn't Get An Abortion?
they Argued, And He Killed Her.
how Did Lisa's Bra Get In Jason's Studio?
Jason Gave Her The Keys, And Her And Max Would Go There When He Wasn't Around.
at Least That's What Jason Said.
they Don't Look So Happy, Do They?
I Don't Understand Marriage.
it's A Mysterious Institution.
you Never Wanted It?
is That A Proposal?
Yes.
I've Been Watching You From Afar.
this Is Weird.
maybe You Should Watch TV.
there's Nothing On.
we Could Play 20 Questions.
does He Have A Key?
he'll Knock.
so, It'll Be Electronic Monitoring?
he'll Have To Stay Here In The Apartment?
Yes.
and We Will All Have To Adapt.
okay, Maybe We Should Just Get On With.
here We Go.
I Love You Both.
Hi.
you're lucky, you know.
I rarely allow anyone into my flat.
I know, I know, I know.
humble digs.
not exactly what you'd call a "panty peeler."
do you know what I mean?
but it suits me just fine.
to be honest, I rarely spend a night in my own bed anyway.
you see, here's my theory:
for most women, if a guy's a good provider and generally a nice chap, six-pack abs really aren't a deal-breaker.
on the flip side, however, even though the PC boyfriend sat next to you with his arm slung around your shoulder will deny it...
and he will deny it. For us boys, it's all about F.B.B.
face. Boobs. Bum.
I'm just being honest.
it's been said that clothes speak the international language.
and I have to admit, I'm a bit of a fashion whore.
unfortunately, today I've got work, and I have to tone it down a little bit, but that's all right. Gucci. End-of-summer sale.
very understated. And I can easily spice it up with...
what? No, no. I know what you are thinking.
if you ooze masculinity, like some of us do, you have no reason to fear pink. Smashing.
now, in the cologne department, most men overdo it.
americans practically spray it on with a crop-duster.
my rule: Nothing above the neck, though I do like a little splash on Big Ben.
you never know where the day may take you.
almost forgot.
new word for the day.
Ostentatious: The attempt to attract attention to oneself.
who? Me?
Oh, blimey. I'm so rude. I haven't introduced myself.
I'm... -Alfie
there you go. Alfie.
are you the little elf that left these mocha bonbons on my doorstep?
no, no, no. You must have a secret admirer, Mrs Schnitman.
you are such a doll, Alfie. But I'm supposed to be on a diet.
Oh, on a diet?
a diet. -You?
Yeah. -Now, I don't mean to be forward, Lu, but you should know by now that a full-figured girl like yourself -is every guy's secret fantasy. -Stop it.
so she's a tub of lard. The ship's already sailed, so why not make her feel good about herself, right?
Oh, Lu -Yes, angel
I'm working the night spot, and my apartment is a horror show, so I'm sorry if I keep you up -with the dust-busting at 2 a.m. -Oh, don't you worry.
I'll give it a quick straighten. -Oh, no, no, you don't need to that.
nonsense. I like doing things for you, Alfie.
I'm a blessed man having you in my life.
thank you.
keys are in the usual spot.
now, back home, you're always hearing tales about some bloke migrating to the states and winding up with buckets of money.
so not long ago, I packed up my bucket and headed west.
now, I must admit, I had a second motive.
I'd always been told that the most beautiful women in the world...
...resided in Manhattan.
and when it comes to shagging birds, it's all about one thing:
location, location, location.
God, I love this city. All right, girls.
just look around. I mean, every one of them, unique, special, like snowflakes.
and with such a plethora...
calendar word meaning "abundance," of gorgeousness and diversity, well, how could a man ever choose to settle down with just one?
I myself subscribe more to the European philosophy of life.
my priorities leaning towards wine, women...
well, actually, that's about it.
wine and women.
although, women and women is always a fun option.
so...
...to live life to the fullest,
I require only enough to cover my modest expenses.
I've no desire to be the richest stiff in the cemetery.
I think this might just be my favourite position.
I know it was President Kennedy's.
he was such a great leader.
of course, JFK used the old bad-back excuse, but if you ask me, he knew it gave you maximum pleasure with minimum exertion.
what is it about the back of a limo?
obligatory cuddling.
thousand one, thousand two...
Cripes. Hey, I've gotta get cracking. I've got a 10: 00 pickup.
you better hurry up. You don't want to keep her waiting.
quite the number, isn't she?
yet, she tells me her old man hasn't shagged her in six months.
six months. I mean, thank God there are gentlemen like me around to pick up the slack.
just look at her. Legs like a racehorse.
perfect yoga bum. I give her my highest grade:
where did we tell the old man we were going tonight?
a movie. -Treasure, please, no, no, no.
stop messing about. You'll ruin my presets.
sorry. -What movie?
I don't know. What's the difference?
the difference is, the more detail you give, the less interested he'll be.
it wouldn't matter what I said.
it would never occur to Phil that another man - would ever look twice at me. - Dor, darling, you fishing for a compliment?
no.
you should know by now they only come from me when least expected.
now, come and have a mint so Phil doesn't smell the Alfie on your breath.
I don't care if he does.
there's one thing that puts me off marriage: It's married women.
Dorie doesn't know it yet, but you won't be seeing much more of her.
I've got that all-too-familiar feeling.
sooner or later, she'll be wanting a little bit more than I'm able to give.
wouldn't it be great if I was going home with you tonight instead of Phil the Pill?
Yeah.
it's definitely time to stage a disappearing act.
so next Tuesday, same time, same place?
I'm sorry, love, it's Fashion Week. I'm booked double shifts.
I'll call you the instant things let up. -Okay.
in the meantime, I left you a little souvenir to remember me by.
Oh, Dor
your derriere looks really rather ravishing from this vantage point.
see?
a compliment when least expected.
what can I say? Happy as a pup with two tails.
and I think I've done old Phil a bit of a favour too.
of course, he'd be the last to see it.
never expect any thanks in this life.
you know what I mean? So Tuesday...
...10: 03 p. m.
do I drag myself home to a cold flat, empty fridge, or nip across town for a hot bath, warm body, breakfast in bed?
decisions, decisions...
Yeah, I think I'll pay a visit to my semi-regular, quasi, sort of girlfriend.
my sweet Julie.
let me guess. Unexpected last-minute fare.
Yeah. She had me going up and down for hours.
that supposed to be funny? Because it is so very...
not.
Hey!
I'm not kidding, Alfie!
I'm not kidding. I hate you sometimes.
you have a very ostentatious way of showing it.
Yeah, I sure do.
no, darling. Can we hit pause? I just need a second to unwind.
Oh, I nicked half a bottle of Stoli from the limo.
how do you want yours, on the rocks?
I just want my usual, Alfie. Straight up.
no, I'm so totally knackered. I'll make it up to you in the morning.
cross my heart.
but tonight, all I'm good for is a bite to eat, hot bath and a nice long sleep.
you know, this isn't a Holiday Inn, Alfie.
what's that again?
where were you tonight? Really?
you've got to open a restaurant. That's seriously delicious.
Thanks, Alfie. It's just chilli.
Hey.
a little eye contact, please.
we have something here, or am I just a glorified booty call?
Hey.
Hey.
here's what she's really saying:
she wants me to commit. Translation: Become "domestified."
now, it doesn't do to become dependent on anybody in this life.
change your nature, you're a dead man.
chilli, please.
don't get me wrong. She's adorable.
cute? Absolutely. But is it ever enough?
I told you how we men are. We want showstoppers.
and the problem is, Julie hasn't got enough of the superficial things that really matter.
I don't deserve you. -Yeah, that's probably true.
too bad I love you.
Thanks, babe.
Alfie, Alfie... -What?
you're giving me the "Thanks, babe."
you're giving me the "Thanks, baby."
calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down!
I know how you feel! - Wait a minute.
you're gonna wake up... -Max.
Hey, little man. Did we wake you up?
Yes.
now, lads, learn from my mistake.
never get involved with a single mum.
see, they come with accessories, some of which can be...
...unfortunately, irresistible.
sights like that make you realize we all have an expiration date.
and women do have a shorter shelf life than men, don't they?
I think that's what Julie was banging on about yesterday.
elegant Limousine and Chauffeur.
this is where I make my reasonably honest living.
standards of elegance has taken quite a pounding, wouldn't you say?
I know. Believe me, it's merely a stepping stone.
currently parked on one of those stepping stones is my best mate and future business partner, Marlon.
black. Like Lonette's skin...
...which I will never again touch.
I'm afraid you're not meeting my man on top form.
see, Marlon's got a problem.
it's called Lonette.
and very recently, it dumped him.
Oh, dear. Come on, what was it this time?
three a. m. Begging, at her front door.
level of inebriation? -Vomiting.
right. So let me get this straight. You were at her front door, 3 a. m. In the morning, begging and vomiting?
and what, she wasn't charmed by that?
Alfie? Why is there no Stoli in car number two?
I've no idea.
I gotta watch this guy like a hawk.
that little chap's name is Wing.
my boss and owner of this tragic enterprise.
wipe that car good. -Owner, that is, till me and Marlon swing a loan and buy it out from underneath his scrawny...
hello. You miss bird shit.
wing.
he's barking mad.
check out the way he talks to the little woman.
she's given him her best years, cooked his chop suey, helped with the business, and I bet at one time he couldn't wait to rip off her kimono. And now look at him.
and I'm supposed to respect the institution of marriage?
that's a great figure, man. We swing that loan, cash your IRA, I hock my Vespa...
we're gonna take Wing by surprise with an offer like this.
I could've predicted this. See, Marlon and Lonette have reached that critical 18-month "Where are we going, what are we doing, what's happening here?" crisis point that rears its ugly head in every relationship. Lonette wanted ring, home, baby.
Marlon wanted another 18 months to make sure nothing better was coming his way.
I fucked up egregiously.
I see you're making the most of that birthday calendar.
by the time he realized he'd made a mistake and he wanted her back...
...it was too late. - Hey, stranger.
Hey.
Carol.
Carol. Hi, Carol. - Hi.
you look wonderful.
so, Carol, well, it's nice to see you again. You be well.
what's up with that?
put it this way, the show closed after one performance only.
do I even wanna know why? - No. Come on, it would be less than discreet to tell you why.
hair on the arms. Seriously. Long, thick...
what are you talking about? You don't have hair on your arms?
you're looking very lovely tonight. - Thank you.
dude, the iron door has slammed shut, man.
classic, isn't it?
now that he can't have her, he thinks he can't live without her.
some people are funny.
Marlon's predicament got me thinking about my own situation.
maybe... Maybe it was time to stoke the home fires.
anybody in the mood for a little Alfie, straight up?
Oh, this isn't a good time, Alfie. Got a lot on my mind.
Oh, God. Yeah, I really hate when that happens.
open up, baby. You look seriously beautiful.
not tonight, Alfred. - What's the matter? Tell me.
I don't... I'm just... Well, I guess I'm... I'm just...
I'm just seeing red.
I mean, the poor guy, he's dying.
come on, haven't you...? You've tortured him long enough.
Alfie, he should've thought about all that before he was screwing around with that ex-girlfriend of his.
those fake-ass, $5 titties.
those are fake? - Hello?
wow, I'm devastated. They've got, like...
Alfie, you're supposed to be consoling my devastation, remember?
I am. Look, he came back, didn't he?
begging, crawling on his knees, vomiting...
I don't care.
I'm sorry, I'm not that easy. I don't forgive and I definitely do not forget.
is okay if I leave now, miss? - Oh, si, Felix.
and hit the lights on your way out, por favor.
I better go.
it's really coming down out there.
Yeah.
and I'm wearing suede.
you're telling the truth. That's brilliant.
okay. I got one. I never swam in the Pacific Ocean.
me neither. - Oh, shit. Okay.
okay. I've never seen a James Bond movie.
you're joking. Not even a Sean Connery?
you serious?
wow, I don't know if that's magic or tragic.
okay. Five ball. My go.
I've never made my own bed. - Oh, bullshit.
no, I repeat, I've never made my own bed.
well, what kind of mama you got?
that's a good question.
let's see. All right.
I got something for you. - All right.
I've never had sex...
I've never had sex with two people in one night.
six-five, your favour.
gotcha.
so, Alfie, what's the most you've had in one night?
we've stopped playing the game, haven't we?
am I wrong, or is there a little innocent flirting going on here?
Driftin' on a memory
ain't no place I'd rather be than with you
loving you
see, if I had that kind of talent...
and a song - Go on, finish your sentence. - If I had that kind of talent, and I looked like you...
and a song ...I would be strutting my stuff - Oh, yeah? - On a stage.
trust me, what happens next was the furthest thing from my mind when I dropped by tonight.
but then I thought to myself, "You know what?
if this will help her get past her anger towards Marlon,
I owe it to both of them, as a friend, right?
to do whatever I can to help.
I find that, lately, even lying to myself comes easily.
the next morning, and I can't get last night out of my mind.
try desperately to focus on something else, anything else.
anything to get my mind off my best friend's incredibly hot, best-ass-I've-ever-seen-in-my-life girlfriend.
Alfie. Alfie.
Alfie! - Shall I pretend I can't hear him?
dude.
Hey! -Too late. Too late.
dude, would you slow down? - Hey, Marly, what's up?
Marly?
Hey, listen, I gotta talk to you. You ain't going nowhere till you tell me what went down last night.
down last night? - Dude, don't mess with me.
what happened with Lonette?
have you ever heard the word "knock"?
what went down? - What? Nothing happened.
we had a few shots. - Missus give me silent treatment.
little she know, not hearing constant "blah, blah, blah" is gift from heaven.
you keep it up. Keep it up, mate, it'll work.
Alfie, what happened?
Oh, fuck a duck, man. Look, I...
I drank a lot last night. - Drunk.
well, I...
I really... I don't remember.
dude, you did something to her. - No.
Oh, yeah, you did. Because she shows up at my house, at 4 in the morning, saying that she wanted me back.
she even said that if I needed more time, that she understood completely.
how fucking crazy.
chalk one up for the blokes. Thanks to me, Marlon won the game.
which means he's off scot-free, and so am I.
this is a bloody miracle. That's fantastic. Fantastic.
come on, what did you say to her? - Look, look.
it's all good. - Come on, what did you say?
I asked her to marry me.
you know you're my best man, right?
moral of the story
no good deed goes unpunished.
new word for the day?
resilience:
the ability to readily recover after disappointment or loss.
capacity to spring back.
understand, it's not about replacing Julie.
I just wanna get back to the simple life.
women who mean nothing to me.
so I've struck up a friendship with a nightclub hostess called Uta.
Hello, Uta.
now, as a heat-seeking bachelor,
I have to live by some very simple rules.
alfie Elkins' credo or philosophy, which is probably best summed up by the only advice my father ever gave me.
he said, "Son, whenever you meet a beautiful woman...
...just remember, somewhere there's a bloke who's sick of shagging her.
can I help you, man? -G and T, please.
explain to me what everyone sees in that Eurotrash?
I think it's incredibly unfair that it's acceptable for men to be sexually experimental, then with a woman, if she wants to try something... A kiss or a threesome.
you know, that they'd be judged. I wouldn't judge them.
and I think if you two were to kiss, I would... I would just...
I would just see it as a thing of beauty.
although I'm living every guy's Rat Pack fantasy, something feels a bit off.
and throwing myself back into the old lifestyle isn't going quite as smoothly as I'd hoped.
sorry.
I'm sorry.
you carry on without me.
Oh, my loves, I...
I don't know what happened. This is so unlike me.
Yeah, you... You two just...
I used to think there was nothing worse than death.
then, from out of nowhere...
...the unthinkable.
now I really don't get what everyone sees in you.
it just keeps on happening and happening.
or more accurately, not happening and not happening.
this never happens, Uta. Honestly, never.
honestly.
not the word around town...
...peewee.
mr Elkins? Miranda Kulp.
Miranda.
the penis doctor is a he with a little bit of she thrown in.
so I understand you're experiencing some erectile dysfunction.
I am experiencing a little... A little... A little bit of... What you just said.
not to worry. That's my area of expertise.
so have you been under any unusual emotional stress lately, Mr Elkins?
stress? Emotional? Me? No, never.
well, unless you count that recent chat I had with Julie.
I can't see you anymore, Alfie.
Why? You angry? - No, I'm really not angry.
just, you know, we want different things.
and I can't have you traipsing in and out of Max's life.
you've changed your hair, haven't you?
you have, haven't you? No, you have.
you've changed your hairdo. You cut it?
it looks gorgeous.
Thanks. - How come...?
how come you never had it like that when we were together?
I really gotta go.
well, I guess...
...you need these back.
thank you.
Alfie?
you gonna be okay?
Yeah. No worries. I'm always okay.
Alrighty, let's take a gander at that penis of yours.
I see.
well.
it seems we have lift-off. - It seems we do.
Wunderschon.
what a relief.
well, I mean, if he can give me a stiffy, I should have no problem keeping it up for the target demographic, shouldn't I?
well, there doesn't appear to be anything physiologically wrong, so, in short, we can be fairly certain your problem -was simply stress-related. -Translation: Julie-related.
like I always say, if they don't get you one way, they'll get you another.
however, - I did feel something a little kooky. - Kooky?
there is nothing to get upset about, Mr Elkins.
I thought I felt a lump...
...on your penis.
but with any luck, it will be nothing.
the words "lump" and "penis" in the same sentence.
there's something you don't hear every day.
and so young Alfred got an early Yuletide gift.
a penis biopsy.
I get my test results in three days... Well, five.
five counting the weekend. Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.
how am I gonna stop myself going completely bonkers?
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
I'm a young man.
shift focus, Alfie. Shift...
let's go, kids. Let's go.
move along, children. Look straight ahead.
come on. Do not look at the man. Look straight ahead.
in the meantime, perhaps I'm safer hobbling on home.
Alfie, dear, what's wrong? You look like death warmed over.
no, I've just... I've got a bit of a football injury, that's all,
Mrs Schnitman... Hello, Mrs Liberman.
you two look lovely. Where you going?
shopping. You need anything? - I'm fine.
hello.
can I talk to you for a minute?
ladies, this is my friend Lonette.
she's lovely. Good for you, dating an African-American.
Yeah.
Hey. Hey, girl. I missed you.
don't mind us. We're not here. You kids keep talking.
very nice to meet you. - See you, Mrs Liberman.
shop till you drop, girls.
so how have you been?
I'm pregnant.
it seems to me the problems you worry yourself sick about never seem to materialize.
it's the ones that catch you unexpectedly on a Wednesday afternoon that knock you sideways.
I offered to face the music with her...
...but she wanted to go it alone.
we both knew that if the baby was born with any white-boy features it would mean the end of Lonette and Marlon.
not to mention your host for this evening.
but standing in the cold, I find myself having regrets.
thinking thoughts like, "Here's another kid you'll never get a chance to know."
your own.
didn't take long.
bloody hell, you're freezing.
how do you feel?
empty.
that night in the bar, I thought I was getting something for nothing.
doesn't seem to have worked out that way, does it?
Oh, man.
if everything turns out okay, maybe this little brush with mortality is a sign.
I should think about making... Making some changes.
possibly.
next week. - Excuse me.
did I just...? Did you just look at me? Did I just notice you turn away?
look, if you know the results to my tests, and they're telling you...
mr Elkins. - Please. Please.
mr Elkins, for the millionth time, sit down.
mr Belson, I have a cancellation on Tuesday at 11: 30.
I'm gonna be fine.
I just feel it. -Thank you. Goodbye.
I'll just be a minute. Or ten.
it's all right. Take your time. - I don't have a choice.
I used to pee. Now I trickle.
I'm Joe. What's your name? - Alfie.
so how you doing, Alfie?
hanging in. You? -Shitty.
Yeah, me too. Me too.
I like the bolo tie. - Oh, thanks. I have a collection.
you know, when you're old, you learn to be patient.
Yeah.
used to be I never had time for nothing. Go, go, go.
I know that feeling. - Yeah.
my wife was always hawking me to take a little vacation. Hawaii. Reno.
I always said, "Next year, Evie, next year."
I got too much on my platter.
I always thought I'd have more time.
then one Sunday night, she takes the pot roast out of the oven.
yells, "Soup's on," and slumps to the kitchen floor.
just like that.
dead as disco.
Jesus, I'm sorry.
I tried picking up the pieces.
even went to Waikiki alone on the 8-day cruise package she was always yakking about.
couldn't get Evie out of my mind.
there's two things I learned in life, kid:
you find someone to love, and live every day as though it were your last.
she's all yours, Alfie.
enjoy.
you all right, son?
Yeah. I hope so.
look, if you ever get bored or feel like schmoozing...
...give me a holler.
you'll never call. - Maybe I will.
all right, good. We'll go to a bar together, hit on some chicks.
damn right.
Thanks, Joe.
Hey.
I'm sorry about Evie.
we...
...weren't all that fond of each other...
...but we were very close.
if you know what I mean. - I think I do.
I've been thinking a lot lately about God and death.
and how, if what they taught me in Bible class is true,
I'm really in for it.
but I won't be partying with Lucifer any time soon, because my test results were negative.
I'm gonna live! I'm gonna live!
I ruined my Prada lace-ups and I don't care.
don't think I've forgotten my oath to completely change my life, because I haven't.
Carrot-apple with a dash of wheat grass.
Yep.
health is now priority number one.
business plan moves onto the fast track.
if you say so... -Tonight's preview at St. Ambrose...
no, I definitely don't want to talk. Okay, hold on, what else have I got?
okay, yeah.
all right, if we must, we must, but...
new slate. New beginning.
what's your name, driver? - Alfie, sir.
wait here, Alfie.
do you know how long you're gonna be, roughly?
you got someplace to go? - No, I was just gonna nip off -and get a cup of tea. - Look, why don't you just stay put.
yea or nay?
a definite yea, I think. Really.
stunning. Wouldn't you say so, sir?
I'm sorry, didn't I ask you to wait by the car?
I reckoned I should help the lady with her packages.
definite yea?
I think.
with one minor...
may I? -You may.
adjustment.
bullfighter. Another lifetime. Don't ask.
fifty, if she's a day.
but don't they say 50 is the new 40, and is she not living proof?
I mean, have a look. Beautifully preserved.
and cleavage like the Holland Tunnel.
better? - Much.
you are so right to trust Chanel. A pair of hot-pink stilettos, and you're good to go.
well, aren't you Mr Full-Service? - We try.
he's getting a little pissy, isn't he? - Oh, it's fine. It's good for him.
is your husband a lot older than you? - He's not my husband.
he's wearing a wedding ring.
well, I never said he wasn't somebody else's husband.
grab the stuff from the trunk -You got it.
Cheers.
ma'am, if you require my services in the future.
happy Christmas, sir. Ma'am.
now that, my friends, is a real woman.
smart and sexy and...
you noticed the little flirt going on between us, huh?
makes me think, if a woman like that, of that calibre should take notice of a bloke like me, then, perhaps...
perhaps I'm selling myself a bit short.
in a flash,
I have my New Year's resolution.
aim higher.
catastrophic. Doomed.
desolate. Cataclysmic.
bought him a word-of-the-day calendar for Christmas.
big mistake.
holiday season, busiest time of the year.
I try to run a business.
what's the problem, Mr Wing? - Your soul brother.
he quit.
in the letter Marlon left me, he called me his best friend...
...but apologized for bailing on our business scheme.
he said his whole thing now was to make Lonette happy.
they decided, on the spur of the moment, to move upstate, and I had a standing invite to drop by any time.
somehow Lonette convinced Marlon it would be too painful to say our goodbyes in person.
and to make matters worse, it all dovetails into the second loneliest night of the year?
Christmas Eve.
a night that brings on all those familiar festive feelings of hopelessness, anguish, despair.
not a great time to be flying solo.
that's why I'm of the belief couples should never split up between Thanksgiving and January 2nd.
always have a relationship to see you through the holidays. Always.
the downside, of course, being gifts.
personally, I've always suspected that everyone else is having a far merrier Christmas than I am.
not that I've ever actually had a Christmas.
that's a whole other Dickens story.
taxi.
taxi.
excuse me.
I'm sorry, mate, it's against the law for me to carry any more than...
thank the Lord.
a Christmas miracle.
all right, hop in.
thanks for saving us. I was freezing my little tush off.
no worries. You know, it's pretty full back there.
why don't you... -Good idea.
why don't I?
Hey, watch the champagne.
all in.
they don't get out much. - You wanna watch out, you guys.
you'll end up with a lump of coal in your stocking.
you're English.
I love English.
what's your name? - Alfie.
you wanna abuse a little substance, Alfie?
no, thanks. I'm trying to quit.
all right. One hit.
merry Christmastime
there's an expression the Yanks use, "Go with the flow."
so, yeah, I got a dose of the holiday blues.
but when a girl of this mind-blowing calibre invites you to a party, it's time to get going and start flowing.
maybe it's the late hour.
maybe it's the heavily spiked eggnog.
maybe it was simply a mutual desperate desire to have ourselves a merry little Christmas.
whatever the reason, hooking up has never gone more swimmingly, and I find myself saying something highly out of character?
I'm renovating my apartment on the Upper West Side.
but, say, you could...
...crash at my sublet, if you want.
see you through the holidays.
that sounds inviting.
and so it came to pass, that after all those years, little Alfred finally got what he wanted for Christmas.
the 12 days of Christmas were flying by at a surrealistic pace.
Yeah, it's been quite the ride.
the package was irresistible.
a showstopper with a new-school brand of sexiness.
who wouldn't get off on the way she makes heads turn?
Plus, we have so much in common.
she's sweet, fun, original, exciting, - Adore you.
full of surprises.
Oh, and did I mention, she makes a cracking good bed.
I began to wonder, could this be the one...
...who finally holds my attention?
happy New Year!
in every doomed relationship, there comes what I like to call "the uh-oh moment."
when a certain little something happens, and you know you've just witnessed the beginning of the end.
and suddenly you stop and you think:
Uh-oh, iceberg ahead.
with Nikki, that was the first of many...
...uh-oh moments.
it began with petty arguments.
followed by random bouts of melancholia.
major highs and manic lows.
this girl never knows when she's had one too many.
and there had been constant displays of erratic, reckless behaviour.
and thank you, no. No, I did not have insurance.
but whenever I begin to feel there's little reason to go on,
I'm reminded that we still have one very major thing in common.
if only she didn't insist on smoking before, after and during.
what time are you gonna be home, honey?
hear that?
what time are you gonna be home, honey?
that's dangerously close to wife-speak to me.
because I'm making something really special for din-din.
Din-din?
I'll call later.
listen, are you sure you don't think that colour's a little bit intense?
I think you're a little bit intense. - Careful, because you've got paint all over your hands.
Plus, you're wearing my favourite shirt to paint the house in, Nik. Don't...
sorry, baby.
I gotta run.
no, I've gotta run.
I bet that I can make it worth your while to stay.
I'm sure you can. But you know what? I've got that meeting.
haven't I? - Yeah.
you know you're in trouble when a sight like that can't keep you planted.
when I was a boy at St. Alban's Secondary School, the school took us on this cultural trip to observe art at one of the...
one of those big famous London museums.
anyway, when I was there,
I came across this statue of a Greek goddess in marble.
Aphrodi... Aphrodite, something like that.
beautiful, she was.
perfect female form.
chiselled features.
exquisite.
I stood in awe of her.
finally, the teacher calls us all over, and I'm walking past it, and on the way I notice, in the side of this Greek goddess, all these cracks, chips, imperfections.
ruined her for me.
well, that's Nikki.
a beautiful sculpture...
...damaged...
...in a way you don't notice till you get too close.
I lost the signal for a second there.
but I don't know.
it's just a lot of personal stuff going on.
you know what I mean?
Oh, I know. - Welcome, Mr Alfie.
good to see you, Elvis. Look, I hope you don't mind me rambling on.
enjoy your evening, sir. -Thank you.
as you can see, the lad's moving up in the world.
it's just that I've got this friend who's, let's say, outstayed his welcome.
absolutely right.
it's a lot tougher getting them out than getting them in. I like that.
you'll never guess who I'm dropping in on now.
I wouldn't have believed it myself a couple of weeks ago.
why don't you just try being honest, and tell your friend that the hotel is under new management and that they have to vacate the premises. You know what I mean.
that kimono does wonders for your decolletage.
big word. - Big decolletage.
why don't we have a drink and you can tell me the rest of your troubles.
instead of me listening to hers. That's a change.
you know, for someone so very young, you're terribly wise.
secret admirer?
one of many.
you would never think of bringing a girl flowers, would you, Alfie?
it would only encourage them.
I'm gonna make us that drink.
what's your poison, sweetheart?
I'll have a spot of whiskey, please. Midleton Rare, if you've got it.
I like dropping a fancy brand name in now and again, let her know she ain't the only one been around.
why not make this an absinthe afternoon?
brilliant.
no idea what she's talking about. -You've had absinthe?
not recently, no. Remind me, what is it again?
the Green Fairy. The French impressionists' liquid drug of choice.
and I got you some of those little egg thingies you like so much.
I mention I like something once, next thing I know,
I get it on a silver platter.
perfect, huh?
kind of pad I plan to earn myself one day.
understated elegance with just a touch of the trendy.
she's a regular fashionista.
you don't have to tell this one which slingbacks go with which frock.
owns her own cosmetics company.
empire, actually.
started out doing facials in a fancy salon.
took a handful of mud, mixed it with a dash of papaya, put it on the market, and bingo: All this.
this stuff is so illegal.
I smuggled a whole batch of it back from Prague in Listerine bottles.
Oh, I checked out your business plan.
And? - I'm impressed.
you seem surprised. - Not at all.
because underneath all that bravado beats the heart of a guy who's a lot smarter than he thinks he is, but not nearly as cocky as he'd like everybody else to believe.
what are we...? What exactly are we basing this on?
this insight into my personality
that it takes one to know one.
what?
I was just wondering if there's a clever little tattoo artist out there who could change "Pablo" into "Alfie."
here's to clever little tattoo artists.
Jesus.
it made me feel all warm going down.
that's my job.
you know what they say.
what do they say?
absinthe makes the heart grow fonder.
Oh, great.
check this out.
have a look at the size of this tub.
she's had two husbands, both croaked, and I have a feeling this was the scene of the crime.
come on, baby, let's get wet.
if she keeps this up, we're gonna be updating that tattoo of hers a lot sooner than she thinks.
remember how little Alfred finally got what he wanted for Christmas?
be careful what you wish for.
there's something else.
dozed off?
Yeah.
I tried waiting up for you.
your meeting ran late, huh? - Very. I'm knackered.
and wet.
but...
...I do want us to have a little chat, Nikki.
okay.
sure.
why don't we talk over a midnight snack.
I made roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.
that was your favourite as a young lad, right?
and check the place out, if you please.
your little girl worked her fanny off. - I noticed. It looks brilliant.
really smashing.
so, Nik... - Alfie, I've been thinking.
will you look at these cute little potatoes?
okay. I know I have been a real handful lately.
I don't know, I think it has to do a lot with me feeling displaced...
...and not totally trusting.
sweetie, cutting to the chase.
I am gonna do better.
I promise.
I am gonna take my medication religiously from now on.
and everything, everything is gonna be easy and breezy.
sound good? Honey?
so come, come and sit. A feast awaits.
I already ate, Nik.
of course.
no worries, we'll have leftovers.
I can whip up a little corned beef hash for brunch.
what's the matter, Alfie?
nothing. I just...
I've got a lot on my mind and...
...I'm feeling a bit... - What?
cold? Distant? Remote? What?
Oh, Nik, this is a complete drag.
everything happened so quickly.
I'm not the best at this sort of thing. - What sort of thing?
I...
...don't know exactly how to say it.
sure you do, Alfie.
you've had plenty of experience dumping girls.
don't worry.
I'm already gone.
strange.
but even when you know it has to end...
...when it finally does...
...you always get that inevitable twinge?
have I done the right thing?
I must admit...
...I do miss the companionship.
Nikki was a showstopper.
but as me ugly old Aunt Gladys used to say, "Looks aren't everything.
I used to think that was a load of bollocks, but just lately I've been thinking...
...maybe the old bat had something.
Julie?
Alfie, hi.
what a surprise.
God, I haven't seen you since... - Yeah.
you look... You look amazing.
Thanks. You too. You look good too.
I'm getting over a cold.
but you're okay otherwise? - I'm fine. I'm always fine.
it's good to see you.
and you.
Hey, you know, I was...
I'm sorry about what happened between us.
and I'm sorry how it all ended up. It wasn't...
it wasn't good.
I felt bad about not seeing Max and about not seeing you.
it's water under the bridge. - Good.
you know...
...I'm wondering...
maybe we...
you know I can never promise anything.
but if you want, if you like, maybe we could see each other again.
it would be okay by me.
it would be more than okay, it would be great.
Alfie, l... - Yeah?
this is Adam.
Hey, how are you?
Hey, how you doing, Adam? - Pretty good.
Adam. -Yeah.
it was great running into you.
you look fantastic. -Thanks.
what time is it? I've gotta go.
I'm late for a meeting. Nice to meet you, Adam.
Julie
Julie - How's Max? - Oh, really good.
will you say hi?
sure. - Or not.
be well.
hello.
hello.
Mrs Wing, is everything...?
wing.
why are you crying?
I'm not crying. Get out.
you sure? - I'm fine. Get out, Alfie.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to see if I could borrow a car.
she leave me.
sorry?
blossom leave me.
Blossom? Is that your wife's name, Blossom?
what I do wrong, Alfie? Love her?
look, mate. Come on, you can win her back.
woo her. Send flowers and chocolates.
write a poem.
that what you do? - Well, actually, no, I've never done that, but it may be a way to go.
what rhyme with Blossom?
I would try "awesome."
okay.
you never cease to amaze.
Hey.
great to see you too, Lon.
I guess I should have rung. Hey, Sam.
well, that would have been a plan.
well, you know, I'm sorry, it was just...
it's nice.
look, Lonette...
this is so uncomfortable, I know. Because...
you don't have to whisper. Marlon's not here.
I really miss you both.
and I just wondered, maybe...
maybe me and you could put it all behind us, pretend like it never happened, and then move forward, you know?
I just...
you know, Alfie...
...dropping by wasn't a good idea.
you two didn't have a baby.
you did have a baby.
no, you were right the first time.
thinking back to that day at the clinic, I remember trying to look in Lon's eyes to see if I could even begin to understand what she was going through, and how she wouldn't look at me.
and I think I knew then.
I just didn't want to admit it to myself.
so classically...
...I said nothing.
I knew there was a good chance the baby could be Marlon's.
at least, I hoped.
this is a lot...
...for me too, Lon.
Marlon stayed.
for now.
is there anything I can do?
what are you gonna do, Alfie?
Hey.
you know, I never...
I never meant... - You never mean to hurt anybody.
but you do, Alfie.
I felt I needed a friend to talk to.
problem was, they were suddenly in short supply.
and I don't remember being in the car. I just... I just... I was stopped.
and I'm crying.
crying for the little one? - I don't know exactly.
maybe for him.
mostly, I think, for me.
and Marlon.
I never had anybody look at me quite like that before.
and believe me, I've had some looks that could kill.
he stood by Lonette. I could've never, ever...
you don't know what you'll do till you really love someone.
well, now what?
you gonna shoehorn yourself into the situation?
no.
you did the only thing you could do. You behaved like a gentleman.
I've never been accused of that before.
don't get all choked up. You also behaved like a scheming, backstabbing, so-low-you-can-look-up-a-snake's-asshole son of a bitch.
next time, think before unzipping.
it's all right. You screwed up.
so, what are you gonna do?
run to the bridge?
the question is...
...What's gonna happen with the rest of your life?
I'd be lying if I didn't admit the events of the past few weeks have knocked me for a bit of a loop.
all right, all right, all right.
Hello, mate.
and what can we do for you this evening?
how much are one of those? - Five-fifty.
and you'll need to put them in water immediately.
right, I'll have that.
second thought.
actually, this is sort of a special thing.
what's the occasion? - Say again?
proposal? -No. No, no.
well, I do want to extend an offer to maybe have a go at it for a bit, give us a spin, that kind of thing.
I get it. Commitment issues.
tell me what she, or he, is like, and we'll find the appropriate bloom.
well, she is...
you know what, she's adventurous.
Frivole. -And very sexy.
I'm thinking Dolce Vita.
a little mischievous. You know, cheeky?
avalanche, with a touch of mio amore.
and then under it all, she's just...
she's just kind of sweet.
Liz?
Hello? - It's me, my love.
Hey, I didn't expect to see you tonight. I thought you were working.
I had a cancellation, so I took the night off.
listen, I thought we should get up early, get out of the city, go to the country and see if we can stay -at that B&B you're always on about. - I'd love to, but I can't.
I have an investors' breakfast in the morning.
how about on the weekend? - Brilliant. Better.
all right. I thought you may...
Oh, my God.
no. Alfie.
Oh, what a sweet gesture. - Milady.
they're not out of some plastic bucket. I handpicked, like, every bud.
I can see that. - And apparently, I have a bit of a flair for flower arranging.
I'm impressed.
talk about being blown away. - Good. Mission accomplished.
I like surprising you.
well, you certainly have done that.
all right, then. Well, you're up early, so I'm off.
I'm gonna see you tomorrow night? - Yeah.
when we speak, there's some things...
some thing I really wanna talk to you about.
what, honey?
I'm gonna wait for the exact perfect moment, and that's all I'll say.
I'll ring you in the morning.
and, Alfie, thank you for the flowers. They made my evening.
Really?
in that case, maybe I'll stay.
I don't...
no, it's not a good idea.
there's a guy in there, isn't there?
God...
go.
don't do this.
what's he got - Better than me? - Alfie, please.
tell me. Please?
really, I would like to know. What's he got? Tell me.
I want to know what he's got. Please tell me.
come on. Come on. Come on, just tell me.
just tell me, come on.
what's he got better than me?!
he's younger than you.
he's younger than you.
I've gotta admit, I didn't see it coming.
she caught me off-guard, all right.
you couldn't tell, though, could you?
as you've learned by now, I'm rather skilled at hiding my feelings.
you see, the thing with feelings is they have this quiet way of sneaking up on you when you least expect it.
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
like with Liz.
who would've thought, of all the women I've known...
...the one I let my guard down with delivers the knockout punch.
ironic.
calendar word.
Dorie.
Hi. - Hello, Alfie.
I haven't seen you in ages. - Maybe because you stopped calling.
I know. Things were getting a bit too...
don't bother explaining. I'm way past needing excuses.
all right. No, you know what? I want to explain.
what? You had your fill of me?
someone cuter came along? I don't need to hear it, Alfie.
look, Dorie... - Really.
look, Dorie...
what happens with me is...
I don't know, I get...
when it gets too... Not close but something like that,
I start to feel... Not stifled, not trapped, but something like that.
and I... And...
you know? You know what I mean?
did that make...? Did that make any sense?
I think it has to make sense to you more than me at this point.
Yeah, fair enough.
I need to go. He'll be waiting for me.
Dorie.
I'm sorry.
good luck, Alfie.
I warned them all from the beginning.
I always said something along the lines of, "I must advise you,"
I am stamped with an invisible warning.
I will not commit. I will never marry.
despite my best efforts, I'm beginning to feel some small cracks in my faux finish.
you know, when I look back on my little life, and all the women I've known...
...I can't help but think about...
...all that they've done for me...
...and how little I've done for them.
how they looked after me, cared for me...
...and I repaid them by never returning the favour.
Yeah.
I used to think I had the best end of the deal.
what have I got? Really?
some money in my pocket.
some nice threads. Fancy car at my disposal.
and I'm single.
unattached. Free as a bird.
I don't depend on nobody.
nobody depends on me.
my life's my own.
but I don't have peace of mind.
and if you don't have that, you've got nothing.
so...
so, what's the answer? That's what I keep asking myself.
what's it all about?
you know what I mean?
CK-2402 PRISON, RUSSIA
do it.
I can't.
orders?
operation skeleton key.
skeleton key?
that was a long time ago.
you're looking for the device.
let me out, and I'll tell you where it is.
sir?
yes?
four hours.
Yes.
Oh, no, thank you.
thank you.
I would like to make a toast.
long overdue, for which I apologize.
well, we've all been a little busy.
still rogue agents shouldn't keep us from properly celebrating your engagement.
the night's young.
don't jinx it.
to michael and Nikita.
meant to be.
it's been a long road and hardfought...
but it's got to get easier from here, right?
where do I start?
and I hope you know i'd do anything for you.
you mean more than taking a bullet?
it's okay. I've taken a shot for Alex before.
actually she shot you.
in the kevlar.
to save her life.
few things say I love you like a bullet to a nonessential area.
well, then, honey, why haven't you shot me yet?
keep talking.
and your toast.
to us.
we can survive each other, we can survive anything.
Cheers. - Cheers.
Cheers.
Birkhoff wants us in now.
he's just upset because we're off shift and he's not.
don't worry. We got it.
what was that?
we don't need to get into this now.
get into what?
something you're not ready to hear.
what?
you need to leave division.
I know you think you owe Nikita something.
you're right.
so, listen, I've been I've been thinking about the way we left things.
maybe we should have dinner, you know?
I appreciate the offer, but I think we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
we've finally reached a place where we can peacefully coexist at work, and I don't want to complicate that.
another dirty 30?
not exactly.
Oh, my god.
I know you and I have more in common than you think, Owen.
division took everything from me too.
if you ever need anything...
I'll be around.
okay?
he's alive.
he dropped off the face of the earth six months ago.
how'd you find him?
evening news.
according to reports, Owen elliot tried to rob a bank in montreal.
same bank where he stopped a robbery two years ago.
nothing was stolen, and he was long gone by the time the cops got there.
it wasn't a robbery.
he's sending me a message.
how do you know it isn't a trap?
Owen wouldn't do that.
why not pick up a phone and call?
he wouldn't know where to call.
last he knew we were in the beach house, and that's long gone.
that's why he's back on the grid.
he wants me to find him.
I know where he's headed next.
take a team. - A team?
Ryan, we've been looking for Owen for six months.
he's not some rogue agent who just refuses to come in.
he probably doesn't even know what's happened here.
and we don't know what's happened to him.
an abandoned school?
after Owen fled that bank two years ago, he went to ground. This is where I tracked him.
don't worry. They know the drill.
nonlethal only.
Yeah, what about you?
I'll try not to shoot him.
where is she? Where's Nikita?
where is she?
No! Owen, Owen, Owen, I'm here.
I'm here. It's okay. Let him go.
he's not a threat. They're with us.
they're with you?
they're division!
Yeah, and so are we.
I know. It's crazy.
but it's a long story.
Percy's dead.
Amanda's gone rogue.
Owen, no one is gonna hurt you, but you have to let him go.
things are different now.
Michael! - What?
I didn't shoot him.
this is ridiculous.
Owen already told us after he got taken by gogol that he was thrown into a russian prison.
we have no evidence to back up his story.
let's just interrogate him and make sure this isn't some ploy.
say what you want about the guy, but Owen isn't exactly a criminal mastermind.
Gogol probably bribed some prison official to keep him off the books, and that's why we couldn't find him.
then there's nothing to worry about.
we verify that he is telling the truth, - and that's the end of it. - Fine.
I'll talk to him.
Nikita, you're too close to this.
okay, we need someone impartial, someone he doesn't know.
Hello, Owen.
I'm Alex. - So you're Alex.
last time I saw Nikita, you guys were on the outs.
so, what, you kiss and make up?
there wasn't any kissing, but yes.
now it's your turn to talk.
you told Nikita you were in a russian prison.
how did you get out?
one of your division cleaners broke me out.
Exdivision.
now rogue.
you knew anne.
were you two friends?
Anne doesn't have friends.
if you and anne weren't friends, why would she help you?
she wanted information on an old mission.
which mission?
operation skeleton key.
NSA had some genius dude in their basement developing unbreakable encryption algorithms.
the thing is, this guy wasn't just designing 'em, he was also figuring out how to crack 'em.
let me guess. Percy found out and, while it's not technically treason, it was close enough for him to blackmail genius dude.
Owen faked the guy's death, and Percy turned him into his pet engineer.
the engineer.
the designer of the black boxes.
before Percy snapped his neck right in front of me.
what's this device that anne was after?
cryptograph.
master key.
access to any system in the world.
any system?
FBI, cia, nsa?
division.
probably why the device was stored offsite for safekeeping.
only three people knew where Percy, the engineer...
and Owen.
and Owen's the only one left.
you've been busy.
Percy, amanda, ari.
checked a lot off your todo list while I was gone.
I got a hair cut too.
you skipped over one thing
shut down division.
what the hell are you doing here?
I'm helping people like us who deserve a second chance.
seems more like you're hunting down and killing people like us.
not killing. Bringing in.
how many you brought in so far?
we are saving lives, okay?
there was a couple of cia assets.
there was a young girl who was kidnapped.
we got her back to her family.
how many rogue agents have you found?
three, but - And how many did you bring in alive?
so when you say things are different, what you really meant is nothing's changed.
look, I've had my doubts like you, but we're still trying to find our feet.
it's only been a couple of months.
is that how long it takes to get numb?
actions have consequences, Nikita.
you told me that.
are you thinking about all the consequences?
we're prepped for retrieval.
we just need to know where to go.
you remember how I told you the engineer's a little bit weird?
the engineer kept his supersecret decoder ring in a cemetery?
he was paranoid.
he hated that Percy kept the black boxes in banks 'cause banks always get robbed.
looks a lot different now.
I guess they got a lot of new dead people.
well, why don't we split up?
what are we looking for? - Anthony george.
it's a flat marker.
Anthony GEORGE 1834-1880
got it!
what is this? Armed grave robbers?
taking fire! We need backup!
Michael, cover me.
I'm going to find Owen.
Mikey, your backup's on the scene.
Alphas approaching your position from the north.
Owen? - He resisted.
get the package out of the back.
it's done.
alpha team, search for survivors.
this one's alive.
what, does anne have a freakin' army now?
Anne's just a soldier.
it's amanda's army.
how exactly did amanda build an army without us knowing?
we knew she was recruiting.
well, that explains anne, but not the other wellarmed mercenaries.
I think some of them are exgogol, just like ari tasarov.
I think they might still be together.
lovely. Well, at least exgogol agents have real identities that we can track.
one of the gunmen from the cemetery survived.
he's in medical. We'll start with him.
what?
I can't figure out why anne tried to grab Owen again.
she had the drop on him. She could have taken him out and split with the cryptograph.
maybe she wanted Owen for something else.
she takes orders from amanda.
so the question is, what does amanda want with Owen?
relax.
no one's going to hurt you.
is this another hospital?
something like that.
what is that? What are you doing?
I'm going to help you.
what are you doing down here?
looking for answers.
I thought if I could remember what amanda did to me back then, maybe I'd know what she wants with me now.
we'll find out what amanda's up to.
we've got one of her guys.
when he wakes up, we're gonna get started on him.
I never told you everything about me.
I never told you about my life before division.
well, I know youyou never liked to talk about it.
cause I can't remember it.
any of it.
my life before division is...
is a blank.
that's impossible. You have to remember something.
I used to think it was a side effect from the drugs they put me on.
I mean, the regimen screwed with everything else.
why not my memories too?
all this time why didn't you tell me?
because there was so much going on.
the black boxes, Percy, the guardians.
I figured i'd have plenty of time - to work it out later. - Yeah.
then you ended up in prison with nothing but time.
that's when I realized, every time I try to remember my life before division,
I get these These headaches, you know.
worse than anything.
they erased your whole life.
she erased my life.
Amanda did this to me, and I want to know why.
why don't you help me find her?
we'll ask her in person.
Beaufort, LUXEMBOURG
did you have a pleasant trip?
caught a show, saw a few friends.
I was surprised when omri said you'd flown to new york.
I have a present for you.
the cryptograph.
so Mr. Elliot really did know where it was.
why else would I have anne break him out of prison?
this is going to make us a great deal of money.
did you see Nikita? - Of course.
I sent her a housewarming gift.
she should be opening it soon.
I don't know why he's unconscious.
there's no sign of head trauma, though I am seeing some fluid buildup near the lungs.
he may be bleeding internally.
let's try to relieve the pressure.
that's not blood. Something's wrong.
what is
danger BIOHAZARD PRESENT
biohazard detected.
biohazard detected.
biohazard detected.
biohazard detected.
biohazard detected.
we're clear.
we're clear.
eight dead. - Including our prisoner.
another four more probably won't make it.
do we know what it was?
liquid sarin.
housed inside a thin silicone pouch.
so when the doctor broke the seal, it hit the air and turned to vapor.
ve ntilation system sealed off the area, but not fast enough.
she did this.
Hello, division.
you must all be wondering how such a terrible accident could have happened in this place where you've always been safe.
well, let me assure you.
this was no accident, and you no longer have a safe place.
Nikita murdered Percy and forced me out.
she killed your friends and comrades, and now you follow her because she told you a story.
you got anything? - We're completely shut out.
if you played along like good little boys and girls, the government would forgive all your sins.
how the hell is she doing this?
it's her shiny new cryptograph.
I think she's taking it for a spin.
if something seems too good to be true, it is.
shut down the signal.
now. - We're trying.
pull the plug. - On the entire system?
but for those of you that stay...
I will hunt you, I will find you, and you will pay with your life.
that is if your government doesn't erase you first.
that's why you went into the field.
you wanted to make sure that your human bioweapon would end up on Nikita's doorstep.
some things can't be delegated.
how did you know they wouldn't kill him?
they trained the medical staff on how to handle injured prisoners and prep them for interrogation.
besides, he was too valuable.
I should have been consulted.
I'm tired of waiting.
it's time to act.
well, congratulations.
in one step you've managed to unite Nikita and all of division against us.
you really think they're gathering up torches and pitchforks?
Ari, they're rats scrambling for a way off a sinking ship.
you're not thinking clearly.
you're letting your anger towards Nikita
I am perfectly clear.
I gave Nikita everything.
that little street urchin with the bad eyebrows, she wasn't a leader.
she was worthless.
I created the Nikita people fear and respect.
then she used the gifts I gave her against me.
I'm ready to return the favor.
Amanda lies. We all know that.
I made a promise to each and every one of you, and I intend to keep it, no matter what.
so let's get back to work. Let's find her.
let's get the other bodies out of the building.
I don't want to take any more chances.
I have something.
we may be able to use amanda's signal to track her.
she thinks she can taunt us.
looks like she overplayed her hand.
Sean?
what are you doing here?
well, you're not returning my calls.
and then I heard that amanda set off a bomb inside division, so, you know, I figured i'd stop by and see if you were still alive.
I'm fine.
I wasn't anywhere near medical when it happened.
look around.
as long as you're here, you're in danger.
you got shot last week, and you could have been killed today.
but I wasn't.
I know you want to protect me, but I made a promise to Nikita.
come here.
I made a promise to my mother, and she ended up dead.
you did everything you could.
when she told me about division,
I could have told her to shut this place down, resign from office, and run like hell.
we are shutting division down.
but it's gonna take some time. And, once we clean things up
when I came here, it was a temporary post.
supervise the cleanup. That's what she said.
but no matter what I did the mess just kept getting bigge and a year later she's gone, this place is standing, and you are still standing in it.
now I can't tell you what to do, Alex, but I'm not gonna stand by and watch this place destroy another person that I love.
what?
I love you.
but, if that's not enough of a reason for you to leave, then I got no reason to stay.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
please tell me we're going amandahunting.
Hey, I think you should sit this one out.
your arm... - Is fine.
this is one mission that I don't want to miss.
I've got it.
they're in luxembourg.
in a wooded area just outside of beaufort.
Yes. That's my gir
excellent and professional colleague.
notify alpha team four. Wheels up in two hours.
we'll brief 'em on the plane.
call it.
Amanda seems fond of fairy tales.
operation black forest.
let's burn the witch's house down
alpha team's first through the door.
clear the path.
Sonya, you're michael and Alex's eyes.
get 'em to that cryptograph.
I got niki and Owen.
we're looking for amanda.
if you do see amanda, you might want to avoid eye contact.
maybe you won't turn to stone, but why risk it?
thanks for the tip, nerd.
our people are in position.
we're a go.
clear.
this is Alex. Heading for the cryptograph.
turn right and go across the hall.
eyes on amanda.
where?
Birkhoff, guide me to Owen's tracker.
I need to get you to safety.
kill them!
cover me!
go!
Owen's not here.
I'm looking at the screen right now.
you should be standing on top of him.
wait a minute. You are on top of him.
basement.
turn around slowly.
I want to know what you did to me.
why'd you screw with my head?
your brain was screwedup way before I got to it.
you were a broken soldier they had to keep locked away.
I fixed you.
keep him still.
everything is going to be all right, Owen.
we'll fix this.
you don't look well.
tell me, are the headaches back?
Hey, you okay?
I got the cryptothingy.
great. Let's go.
come on.
I should shoot you.
Oh, but you need me.
you want answers, and I have them.
damn it. Tell me what you did.
where do you want me to start, Owen?
or should I call you sam?
that's what your friends used to call you before you killed them all.
isn't that right, sam?
maybe you should give this to me.
we don't want you to hurt anyone else.
Anne, shoot Mr. Elliot.
no. He comes with us.
I didn't go to all this trouble just to have you kill him.
all this trouble?
I can't get in the room. It's a steel door.
what room? I'm looking at the plans right now.
there is no room.
it's new.
what's Owen's position?
he's at your two, four meters in.
this was never about the cryptograph.
you knew where it was the whole time.
you wanted Owen.
you would never have agreed to break him out if you didn't think he had something to offer.
now he offers a distraction.
Owen's hurt! I need help!
Amanda's, she getting away.
Oh, she said she knows!
now It's okay. We'll get her.
don't you worry.
I need help!
Hey, you've reached sean pierce.
I'm not here to take your call, so leave a message.
you're still a terrible patient.
you're supposed to be laying down, you know.
Yeah, if you want your patients to stick around, you should probably get a tv in here or something.
somebody's head is better.
you're making complete sentences again.
I'm still a little fuzzy.
I don't know what she did to me, but she must have shortcircuited my brain or something.
you know, after emily died,
I got up every morning thinking that today would be the day that I'd finally put an end to Percy.
you know?
that's what drove me.
now he's gone, and the whole world has changed.
I'm not really sure what's next.
hell, I'm not even really sure who I am.
you know who you are.
you're our first success.
you're the first rogue agent we've brought in...
alive. - Yeah.
finally get to chalk one up in the win column?
Yeah, well, I think it just means that we might...
be getting the hang of it.
you know, it only counts if I stay.
my schedule is pretty clear.
I guess I could stick around.
I don't know about you, but I'm starving.
you're sta...
Oh, you want to...
I would love to, but I'm right in the middle of...
what?
what is all this?
I kept thinking about amanda's prophecy of doom.
so she used the cryptograph to get into our system, but how did she know when to do it?
maybe she knew when the gas had been released, like it was some sort of trigger for the video.
I thought of that.
she didn't access our system until an hour after the attack.
for her to know that, she would have had to have someone on the inside.
I couldn't think of another explanation.
show me what you've done so far.
thought you were hungry.
we'll order in.
you can pay.
we'd have to kill the delivery man.
true.
since we blew up amanda's safe house, she and ari are back on the run.
it's not a total win, but it's a start.
Owen's staying. It's a win.
I took a look at the room you found Owen in.
and something caught my eye.
we don't know what the chair does, but birkhoff recognized this.
it's used for brain surgery.
Amanda tried to lobotomize him with it.
you think she was gonna use that on Owen?
she already did something to him.
Owen's tests showed scarring in his brain.
it's not recent, and it's not due to an injury.
they're surgical scars.
that's what caused his memory loss.
most likely. Amanda won't stop.
she is angry, and her rage is focused on you.
I can handle amanda.
in the last 48 hours, she has ambushed us, tried to kidnap Owen, and set off a bioweapon within these walls.
that is one hell of an opening move.
then we figure out what she's gonna do next.
antwerp, BELGIUM
I have a task for you, anne.
Owen?
Oh, that ship has sailed.
Nikita knows I wanted Owen for something.
she'll be too suspicious for my original plan to work, but I have an even better idea now.
why not just kill Nikita?
I could have done it in the cemetery if you'd allowed it.
death is the last step of her journey, and we're not there yet.
her journey?
Oh, I'm not done teaching her, anne.
I am not done teaching her.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing...no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI
you know spies...a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line...as long as you're burned,
mysterious trips around the world with Max.
I mean, he's, what, your keeper or whatever?
he's my agency contact.
the right people are starting to take notice.
michael Westen, soon-to-be reinstated agent of the CIA.
how does that sound?
that sounds great, Max. Thanks for everything.
stay with me， stay with me. Max. Max.
Fi, someone shot Max, the police are on the way, and I think I'm holding the murder weapon.
I covered my tracks so I covered the tracks of the killer.
Michael, we have to do something about that gun.
and we need to get an alibi for you, like, right now.
let's go to work.
as a spy, you're in the information business...stealing it, protecting it, and, if you have to, destroying it.
some secrets are so dangerous that you can't allow them to continue to exist.
a murder weapon that implicates you in a crime you didn't commit, for example, is a secret best kept with 4, 000 degrees of burning thermite.
Hey. Got here as soon as I could.
how'd it go? - Okay.
I put together some credit-card receipts putting everyone in Key West yesterday on a little vacation.
key West? - Hey.
you want an alibi on such short notice, you don't get to be picky.
you guys are melting down a gun.
I don't have much choice.
whoever did this knew exactly what they were doing.
they managed to put a murder weapon in Michael's hands and get away clean.
I just want to put this out there.
if we go to the cops now - No.
it's not gonna fly. I talked to the cops.
the CIA has taken over the scene.
they got a case officer down here now.
and she wanted me in for a chat.
Oh. Great. Perfect.
and you have no idea who killed Max? - None.
could be an enemy of Max's who wants a burned spy for a fall guy or an enemy of mine looking to keep me out of the game.
what about the people who burned you?
you said you had doubts about that investigation.
anything's possible, but I'm not gonna be able to find out if I'm in jail for first-degree murder.
we have to get rid of the gun. - Are you sure about this?
once you start a cover-up, there's no going back.
it's already started.
I trashed the key logs at the murder scene and wiped the place down.
the only thing that's gonna save me is finding the real killer.
this train's rolling, brother.
the only question is whether you get on board.
hell yeah. I'm on board. Yeah.
you must be Michael Westen.
I'm Agent Pearce. Thanks for coming.
no place I'd rather be.
Max was... - A friend? I know.
I'd, uh, offer my condolences, but I'm much better at catching bad guys than shedding tears.
we'll find whoever did this.
what can I do?
let me walk you through the scene.
you be the killer.
we found two bullets out in the hallway, so if you are the killer, you fire on Max out there, miss, then chase him in here.
blood spatter says Max was... where I'm standing.
you bust in, put two shots in his back.
he bleeds out here.
now Max is dead.
what do you do? - Run to the exit.
I think you head for the key log.
so, you rip the hard drive out of the wall.
now there's no record of your entry.
but how do you get out clean?
elevator.
no trace. Try again.
I hope you're not asking me to jump.
Oh, you're the killer in this little exercise.
is that how you escaped? - Not unless I could fly.
we found rope fibers, and I got friction marks right here.
the killer rappelled down.
probably had help. How are your climbing skills?
not bad. Why?
am I a suspect?
to be honest, when I heard a burned spy was mixed up with Max, my first instinct was to fit you for a head bag.
I appreciate your restraint.
well, you did show up today.
and as your new agency contact, a head bag wouldn't have started us off on the right foot.
you're Max's replacement?
we worked on some operations together.
I have some investigations experience.
I asked for this assignment.
Max was one of the good guys.
I want to find out who did this just as much as you do.
I'd love to have you on the team.
you should know this about me, though...
I've got a pit bull at home, and I learned how to run an investigation from her.
she sinks her teeth in, she doesn't let go.
ever.
she sounds like a nice dog.
she can be.
but she is a very, very determined bitch when she wants something.
I need to know I can count on you.
I'm your man.
I was hoping you'd say that, Michael.
I don't get it.
you're joining the CIA manhunt?
did you forget that search could end up at your doorstep, Michael?
if I'm one of the hunters, maybe I can avoid that.
Plus, looking over Pearce's shoulder gives me a bird's-eye view of the entire investigation.
we should be working our own angle to find out who killed Max.
Pearce is already checking the cellphone activity from the day of Max's murder.
why can't I just cheat off her notes?
you think the killer made a call? - Maybe.
I've never seen the police respond that fast.
at least I can make sure that they don't track the phone call I made to you.
so, check the phone records.
but if Pearce starts poking around, don't forget there are no conjugal visits in CIA jail.
is that who you're supposed to be meeting here?
Yeah. - Bad time for a client.
who is he?
he was with the Special Forces in Afghanistan.
my C. O.tracked me down, asked for a favor.
and you're...
not telling the captain who pulled me out of a burning jeep that "I don't really have the time right now.
Michael. Lieutenant Ethan Reed.
Mrs. Westen.
why don't you grab a seat, Lieutenant?
so, what can I do for you?
captain Novak didn't tell me, really, what this was about other than we have a lot in common.
well, the CIA recruiters on base were hounding me pretty bad until I made it clear I wasn't interested.
or maybe it's that I beat your sharpshooting record at Camp Rhino...
94% from 600 meters.
so, you're here to pick up the trophy?
no, no. I,um...
is there somewhere we can talk that's more private?
let's take a walk.
so, I got back from my tour in Afghanistan a couple of months ago, and I found out that my sister was dating this guy, Brandon, a-and I knew he was a scumbag, but he seemed harmless.
what happened?
he, uh, he nearly beat her to death.
he put her in intensive care.
I'm sorry, Ethan. Have the cops done anything?
they'd arrest him if he fell in their lap, but they're not looking for him very hard.
I thought you could help me track him down using some of your resources.
right up my alley. - Fi.
you end up finding Brandon. What next?
after what he did to Heather...
I think Ethan's already picked flowers for Brandon's funeral.
you're not thinking this through.
she's your sister.
it won't take long for the cops to figure out you're the number-one suspect.
so, that's it? You're saying you're not gonna help?
no. If you want my help, Brandon goes to jail, not to the morgue.
fine. But I'm coming along every step of the way.
when we catch him, I want to be there.
at the very least, I owe this guy a broken nose.
I can live with that. - Go to your meeting.
I'll call Sam and see if we can lure Brandon out of hiding.
Mrs. Depaolo?
we don't mean to bother you, but is your son, Brandon, here?
sorry. He moved out years ago.
Oh, uh, could you tell us where to find him?
because Brandon's got himself a brand-new laptop, hell, maybe even an iPad, if this check ever finds him.
I don't know where he is.
and why is he getting a check?
it's a legal matter.
your son had some auto-body work done at a shop in Brickell a couple years back.
well, the owner of the shop just lost a class-action lawsuit.
he was overcharging his customers.
Brandon was a customer, so Brandon gets a check.
I mean, two g's may not seem like much, but... - $2, 000?
I know it's an inconvenience, but maybe you could take the check and hand it off to Brandon next time you see him?
I...I could do that.
great. Thank you very much.
so, she took the check. Now what?
well, now Cathy takes the money to Brandon, or he shows up here.
almost always works, but it's not fast.
why don't you go home? We'll take the first shift.
no. No, I'm on every shift.
lucky us.
whether you're operating out of a war room in Langley or commandeering a hotel in South Beach, all CIA investigations work the same.
because analysts are tied directly into federal and local databases, they have information at their fingertips.
what they don't have is a magic button that tells them what is a real lead and what is a dead end.
that takes boots on the ground, eyeballs on the screens, and lots and lots of coffee.
what, the CIA can't afford filing cabinets?
I don't think I'll be getting much sleep until we find Max's killer.
so, where are we? What are we doing?
we'd like to revisit your final operation with Max.
I read the file...some sort of corporate espionage the French were involved with?
dead end. Got out clean.
the operation before that, then.
I'm telling you, that's not where you want to look.
we were doing small-scale field operations, nothing that would get anyone killed.
if you are trashing my leads, you would better have something to suggest.
how about cellphone activity around Max's office?
the FBI's gonna run them down.
FBI? That's three weeks of red tape.
are you sure that's a good idea?
these investigations take time, Michael. You know that.
someone who's not "official" could work a lot faster than the FBI.
if that were the case, I wouldn't want to know details, because if that person got caught digging...
they'd be on their own.
it was nice not seeing you today.
what's with the "Yellow Pages"?
just a little pleasure reading.
this is not taking forever.
Brandon's not gonna show.
he'll show. Just be patient.
in Afghanistan, things were a lot simpler, you know?
you get your orders, you get your bullets, take your shot.
who do you think gets the intel to tell you where to point your rifle and take that shot?
a spy sitting in a car all day.
at least we got yogurt.
hold on. We have a guest.
Yep, that's Brandon, all right.
that son of a bitch.
hold on. Hold on. We talked about this.
we'll grab him on the way out.
whether you're kidnapping a ruthless dictator in a foreign country or snatching an abusive boyfriend off the street, it's best not to leave a mess behind.
using your target's own car as a getaway vehicle keeps neighbors from asking about the missing owner.
Plus, you don't have to pay for gas.
don't worry. We're not gonna hurt you.
we're just gonna ask you some questions.
you think you could beat on my sister and get away with it?
Ethan! - I didn't ...I d...
Ethan! He didn't give a beating. He took one.
what does that mean?
it means there's more to this than what we know.
look at his face.
stand down. Stand down.
you're all right. You're all right.
we're just gonna go for a little ride.
gonna sort this out.
Really?
I didn't touch your sister, man.
I would never hurt Heather.
then tell us who did.
it's my boss, Brad Ramsey.
he runs a medical-insurance scam in Homestead.
he'd give me money to pay off medical clerks.
I wanted to do something nice for Heather, so I skimmed some of the cash to take her away for the weekend.
and Ramsey found out.
Heather fought back. I tried to help.
you left her bleeding in the driveway of a hospital like a stray dog.
what was I supposed to do? - You were supposed to protect her!
and what about you, big bro?
Heather tried calling you for help, but you were too busy playing Captain America in Afghanistan.
interrogation 101...you lose your head, they stop talking.
you can skip the spy school.
this bastard is the reason Heather's breathing through a tube right now.
breaking his jaw is not gonna get him to talk.
go on. Cool off. Go outside.
okay.
Upsy-daisy. Stop crying.
you're all right.
now, if you don't cooperate, I'm gonna let Ethan come back in here and talk to you.
alone.
do you understand?
all right.
tell me everything you know about Brad Ramsey.
people tend to think spies are motivated by love of the game, desire for adventure, or patriotic fervor.
the truth, though, is that you don't choose a life as a covert operative unless something deeper is going on beneath the surface. something more personal, something harder to explain, and something a lot more painful.
I should have been there.
it wasn't your fault.
she was so beautiful.
now look at her.
if you want to get the guy who put her in here, I know how to do it.
so, that's the guy who beat my sister?
that's him.
Ramsey runs the scam, Brandon was wrapped up with.
the other chucklehead is Joel Davenport.
he steals Medicare numbers so Ramsey can use them to bilk the insurance companies.
these guys are ruining a lot of lives.
this clinic is used to help people, but now it's basically just a private ATM for these scumbags.
so the guy's even more of a bastard than we thought?
same plan as before, right?
dragging Ramsey to the police isn't an option now.
the cops were your idea, remember?
well, your sister basically helped rip off a scam artist.
man, I'm just saying the cops are not gonna make it a priority.
we grab him now, Ramsey spends a few hours behind bars.
he'll be out in time for happy hour.
now, on the other hand, if we can get him to show us the details of his little business, he'll rot in jail until you're old and gray.
we're just gonna politely ask him if we can see his scam?
you think that'll work?
no, I'll have to approach Ramsey as the kind of guy he'd want to talk to.
no. I'm approaching Ramsey.
was I unclear when I said I'm coming along every step of the way?
Ethan, you're not trained for this.
then train me.
when this is over, I want him to know it was me.
I owe that to Heather.
all right, kid. Fine.
you're gonna need a suit.
excuse me. We're looking for Brad Ramsey.
well, you found him.
we don't mean to spoil the party, but we'd like a few minutes of your time, talk a little business.
Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure that you guys aren't on the guest list.
just give us two minutes of your time.
no interruptions, no intrusions.
and I promise you, next year at this time, your vacation home in Rio will make this place look like a dollhouse.
let's talk over here.
what kind of business you guys in?
same as you.
only on a much bigger scale.
we can't go into much detail right now, but our network is pulling in some serious cash.
we'd like to bring you in.
I only work for one man-me.
I'm doing just fine on my own.
that's why we want you.
but why settle for "just fine" when you could be doing "great"?
you got to think bigger.
I mean, sure, your kiddy pool with a "view" is fine.
but the pool at our place on Star Island...now, that's great.
come to our party. Check it out.
who knows...maybe you'll like what we have to offer.
no offense...I mean, I'm sure you guys are doing great, but, uh, I got things under control.
we're talking the big time here, Ramsey.
you want to be bush league forever?
bush league?
who are you calling bush league?
uh, you'll have to forgive my young, enthusiastic friend.
when we found him, he was scraping by on 6 grand a week in a timeshare scam, so we had to drag him out of the gutter.
sometimes his passion gets ahead of his manners.
here's our info.
in case you change your mind about... Moving up in the world?
I have to get back to my guests.
feel free to stick around. Have a beer.
and then get the hell off my property.
I just blew it. - You did fine.
did you clock his face when I said "6 grand a week"?
we'll be seeing him again.
Hey, man.
what... I'm sorry.
am I in the...wrong... This is Michael Westen's place, right?
look, I knew Fi was gonna shake things up a little bit in here, but come on, now, man.
you got a breadbasket. Are you cool with all this?
Yeah, you know, it's, um...A process. - Right.
do you have an update on those phone records? - Yes.
but before I do, I just want to point out, even if you can dodge this frame-up thing, you and I could get into a lot of trouble for this.
I owe you, Jesse.
no, I mean, like, this is in violation of an executive order and a pretty big constitutional amendment.
I really owe you? - Yeah. You do.
okay. All these red dots represent cellphone calls made around Max's building.
now, if we eliminate all the calls made a half-hour before or after Max's death, anything with, uh, family plans, anything easily traceable, we are left with... One call.
made from a burner cell to a pay phone. Boom.
the killer was probably signaling that the job was done.
it's a dead end. - Oh, no.
you will not rain on my cellphone-magic parade, because I tracked the burner to the bodega that sold it.
I'm gonna go grab the security tapes and find out who bought it.
I really, really owe you, Jesse. - Yes, you do.
Sam, what's going on?
Ramsey just called.
said he can't wait to go to our party.
you would've been proud, Mikey.
watching Ethan work a cover was like seeing a baby take his first steps, only, you know, less adorable.
did your new lady friend get us a car?
ha, you call it a car.
I call it a work of art.
what about the house?
are we ready to introduce Ramsey to a new life?
Yeah, yeah. We're all set. But listen, Mike. Just so we're clear, nothing happens to big mama's wheels or the mansion.
cause once you've laid your head on 2, 000-thread-count sheets, you never want to go back to the couch.
Ohh, yeah.
is that potpourri that I'm smelling?
you're killing me, man.
jealousy is a delicate emotion.
show someone what they can't have, and they'll just resent you.
give it to them too easy, and they won't appreciate it.
they key is allowing them just enough of a taste so all they want is more.
our guest of honor.
I still can't believe I'm supposed to drink with the guy.
just think of it this way...every time the bastard cracks a smile, he's tightening the noose around his own neck.
Hey!
look who's here!
it's about time.
better late than never.
think our friend here needs a drink, yeah?
Yeah.
so I said,"Shoot the dog." - And so I did.
Oh, sorry, ladies.
come on, now. - Don't worry.
we'll get to them later.
there's somebody I want you to meet.
fast Eddie, Brad Ramsey.
the infamous Brad Ramsey.
bring it in here.
I've been called worse.
Yeah, I'll bet you have, man. - Hey, sit down, guys.
please, please.
so, Eddie here... Is the wizard behind our global network.
he sets up fake medical facilities that spit out real money.
it's easy, really.
a lot of places around the world, healthcare is 10% of the GDP.
it's so big, no one even notices when we take a little slice for ourselves, isn't that right?
that's just fancy talk for "We have a very good thing going.
Oh, look, I'm a little low.
why don't you fill him in? I'll be right back.
it seems like you guys got it all figured out.
what do you need me for?
one can never have too many friends.
south Florida is a...is a Medicare gold mine, okay?
our only problem is, we're not hooked up down here. You are.
so we want to see your whole network.
then we combine your ideas with our capital, everybody gets rich.
what, are you crazy?
it took me seven years to set up my business.
you think I'm just gonna hand it over?
no, w-we're not asking you to hand over anything, Ramsey.
this is a merger.
we get to see the details behind your operation, the mind that created it, and then you get all this.
there's the boss.
he blew off Pebble Beach to meet you.
shall we?
come on, man.
beautiful.
Eduardo. - Boss.
you must be Ramsey. Welcome aboard.
not so fast.
I ain't signing any dotted lines just yet.
did I hop on my G6 for a "Maybe"?
what can I say? The best don't come easy.
I'm sorry. - "I'm sorry"?
"I'm sorry" doesn't get me back on the links in time for the back nine, does it?
what's the holdup?
it's not his fault.
this seems too good to be true.
then your guys start asking details about my business.
I mean, how do I know you're not cops?
fair question.
deserves an honest answer.
cops write tickets.
cops eat doughnuts.
they don't do this.
son of a bitch!
careful. I learned jujitsu on the sands of Okinawa.
that's...that's my car!
no, that's not your car.
that's your car.
I call it the thinking car.
take your time. Have a ball.
thinking car? - Felt right at the time.
it felt...I don't give a damn how it felt. I better see my car again, Mike.
I know the feeling, buddy.
so, when are we finished with the car-giving phase.
I'd love to get to the ass-kicking phase.
seducing Ramsey with our scam is a process, Ethan.
he's inches away from giving us everything we need to take him down.
now, the more info we can ask him for about the scam, the more he's got to talk to his guys.
we drop a bug in those conversations, the cops are gonna have some easy listening.
so, what, I have to hang with him some more?
as soon as we get everything we need from the bug, you can break off your friendship, - but you have to be... - Patient. I know.
so, how do we get the bug on him?
well, Ramsey was damn near drooling over my watch, Mike.
great. Let's give him another gift.
Mike... What happened to the bench, the one with the work toys?
Fiona thought that she didn't want to mix work with... It's in the back now.
when bugging a watch, it's better to use a good-looking knock-off than its authentic counterpart, and not just because it's easier on your wallet.
the insides of a fake timepiece are usually smaller and simpler, leaving more room for hiding a listening device.
as long as your target isn't a watch connoisseur, zinc alloy and cubic zirconia are a great way of saying "Let's be friends.
Ramsey, my man.
here you go.
boss was glad you finally came to your senses. I was glad, too.
Yeah, I'll be glad when I start to see some serious green.
eager. Yeah, I like...I like that. It reminds me of me.
once you give the boss the details on your operation, we'll bring you up to speed on our system, and from there, smooth sailing.
look at this.
I got you a little welcome gift.
well, now. I think that'll look just great on me.
I got one just like it. I call it the lucky watch.
if I were you, I'd never take that thing off.
think I can do that.
all right. Come on. The guys are waiting for you.
a thousand bucks you hit nothing but water.
we'll see about that. Pull!
double or nothing?
look who I found.
if you're here, then you're done thinking.
that car can be pretty convincing. - Good.
now that you're coming on board, let's iron out the details.
we need to get an understanding of how you move your money around.
way ahead of you. This is the Medicare fee schedule from my last scam.
you came all the way here to waste our time?
this could have been written on a cocktail napkin!
what we're looking for is, well, everything.
all your doctor names, all your patient numbers, every little detail of your enterprise.
you give us that, then we can move forward.
triple or nothing?
I'll talk to my guys, put something together.
you do that.
and just so you know, I'm keeping the Porsche.
if you tried to give it back, I'd worry about you.
Yeah, uh, Mike, since Jesse's helping you with your little CIA problem, you might want to get his car back for him.
one problem at a time, Sam.
in certain neighborhoods, posing as a dirty cop is a great way to confiscate information.
it gives you the authority that comes with a badge and invokes the fear that comes with being a criminal.
Hello, there.
I'm Officer Stone.
we have ourselves a little situation.
last week, Officer Goodtimes over there came in here and bought a jug of vodka with his pay-by-the-hour friend.
stressful job, Sharon. Guy's got to blow off a little steam every now and again.
this guy knows what I'm talking about.
the thoroughly embarrassing evidence is all over your surveillance tapes, and we're gonna need them.
those tapes are pretty expensive.
I suppose I could part with them for, oh... 500 bucks?
you know what, it might be easier to throw your sorry ass in jail for those bootleg DVDs you got back there.
and selling booze to minors.
got a real state-of-the-art operation going on here, don't you?
it's everything from last month.
we're gonna need some popcorn.
got a better idea.
throw in a carton of smokes.
and I'm watching all of these why?
a friend of mine, he was murdered. The killer might be on one of these tapes.
what am I looking for exactly?
whenever you see someone buy a cellphone, mark the date and time.
well, it's your lucky day,'cause I'm boycotting my favorite soap this week.
Dr. Wesley broke off his engagement, and he moved to Alaska!
that's too bad.
how's it going with -- what's his name?
Ethan? He's holding his own.
Joel, Joel. Just give me the paperwork for the doctors' I. D.s.
how am I supposed to trust you?
what the hell are you talking about? I'm in charge of this.
your judgment's off lately!
those guys who gave you the Porsche...you don't even know them!
are you sure this is gonna work? - We'll make it work.
I talked to the other guys, and they all agree with me...you're a liability.
first, you put that girl in the hospital. If she recovers...
if that bitch recovers, I'm gonna finish her off! No big deal!
what... what are you doing? Let go of me.
Joel, I need you to listen to me very carefully.
he's talking about killing my sister. - You all right?
I got no problem putting you or any of the other guys in the hospital.
Yeah. I,uh, I just need to get some air.
this is my business, not yours. I make the decisions.
you're not even supposed to be back here.
we'll talk later.
O-okay, fine. I got it.
what do you want to bet he's going after Ramsey at the clinic?
then we better get there first.
where the hell is he?
Oh, Ethan's a sniper. He's not taking a shot from here.
he'd try to find a perch.
right there. 9:00.
man, that kid set up fast.
he wouldn't fire on Ramsey in a crowd, would he?
no. He's like Michael. He'll wait for a clear shot.
all right. Let's go. I'll talk him down.
it's too late. We need a distraction.
protecting a target from a bullet sometimes means taking a few shots at them yourself.
a near miss puts the target on their guard and keeps the real gunman at bay.
Fi. Fi, not my car!
relax. I'll just put one through the windshield.
but you can never predict how someone is going to react to a bullet whizzing by their head.
what the hell, man?!
just the windshield, Fi?
he was... - He never got a shot off.
fi fired first and scared Ramsey away, which is not to say it's a victimless crime because my car...
what the hell were you thinking?
you want to know what I was thinking?
I was thinking as long as I corrected for a slight breeze and pulled the trigger on my exhale, the guy who put my sister in the hospital wasn't going to exist anymore.
we had a deal. We had a plan.
Yeah, and your plan wasn't working!
it wasn't working as fast as you wanted it to. Big difference.
you got a way to bring the son of a bitch down before I retire? I'm all ears.
we needed Ramsey talking to his crew.
now he thinks someone's trying to kill him.
he's not gonna talk to his crew. He's not gonna talk to anyone. He's gonna ...
three voicemails in the last hour. Ramsey can't stop calling me.
Oh, come on. That's a little funny.
dude's reaching out to the guy that, um, tried to kill him.
I'm sorry.
Ethan, we can still use this.
things are already tense in Ramsey's crew.
you call him. You tell him... - No, no, no, no, no!
I'm done pretending to be this bastard's friend!
all right, so, uh, well, it sounds like you want to turn Ramsey on his own crew, pin the shooting on them?
but the only person who can run point just walked out the door.
And? - He is not an option.
unless you want to be in the room standing between Ethan and Ramsey.
familiar scene out there.
you remember when you came home on leave that first time?
you spent hours out there the day that you found out that Patrick Garney had stolen your girlfriend.
and then you stole his motorcycle and drove it into the Miami River.
mom, I think this is a little different.
if you say so.
how many years of training did it take before you learned to curb your anger, Michael?
the man you are today is not the boy who left home.
you were a scared kid when you left.
you were angry at the world. You were angry at everything.
I've seen loved ones get hurt.
I've never plotted to kill anyone in cold blood.
no. Your mother raised you better than that.
someone has to teach him, Michael.
you can save it.
you want Ramsey dead, and you don't think I have anything to say worth listening to.
well, I understand that feeling.
so, uh... Do you want to compare body counts?
all right. If it's gonna be that kind of talk.
actually, it's not.
I'm telling you I know more about this than you do.
you're not in a war zone anymore, Ethan.
so you're saying you think I'll regret killing the guy 'cause this isn't a battlefield?
listen to me. I won't. I want to finish this my way.
you don't get to do what you want to do.
you lost that right the moment your sister got beaten.
what's that supposed to mean?
your life doesn't belong to you.
your decisions affect other people.
you need to start thinking about Heather.
that is what I'm doing.
you can't help her from jail.
you know who acts out of selfish anger?
the Ramseys of this world.
and that's their weakness.
and that's what you use to destroy them.
what do I do?
you look Ramsey in the eye one last time.
you go to bat for him.
you convince him you are his best friend.
and when he's ready to burn his whole life to cinders...
you hand him the match.
Ramsey! Ramsey! - Come on.
Ramsey, what the hell's going on?
come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
someone shot at me coming out of the clinic.
I hope to God you're kidding. Someone's shooting at him.
we're through here. Thanks for playing. Next.
whoa, hold on. Hold on.
every problem's got a solution. Does anyone have a reason to shoot at you?
do you have any problems? I mean, do any of your people know about our deal?
my guys? Oh, they would...they would never.
all right. Well, wait. There was...there...there was one...
there was one guy that was pissed that I was talking to you.
every time we work with amateurs, the minute money's on the table, people start shooting.
okay, but it's his people. It's not him. So give the guy a break.
you can take care of this the way you did for me.
hold on. What are you talking about?
he means turn your crew over to the cops. Are you slow?
that's how we got rid of the kid's baggage when he started working for me.
turn the cops on my crew?
if they're shooting at you, they're not your crew anymore.
if you're working with us, we got to tie up loose ends.
I can't... - Ramsey!
this is the moment, all right?
if you want to work with us, this deal could pull in $50 mil a year.
that's 10% for you. That's your cut.
$5 million?
Yeah, but you don't get any of that unless you can take care of your problems here.
what's it gonna be?
kid, let's go. - All right, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
all right. I can do this, okay? Yes.
change your shirt. You look like a hick.
call our guys. Let's get this done.
this is everything I got.
you sure none of this is gonna point back at me?
not that it matters.
you'll be on the beach in the Caymans.
maybe you'd like a little company.
all right.
love to stay for the fun part, but we got to jet.
what's this for? - It's for the house.
we're making sure nothing connects any of this to you.
you want me to burn my own house down?
uh, yeah. Come on, Ramsey. Be serious.
how many parties have you had in this place?
your crew has fingerprints everywhere, hair, DNA, all kinds of crap.
believe me. We're gonna set you up with a new place to call home.
for a spy, revenge is a dish that is rarely served at all.
the mission objective always takes priority over personal satisfaction.
care to do the honors?
but if conning a scam artist into burning everything he's worked his whole life to build serves that mission, it's hard not to take a little joy in watching it all go up in flames.
come on, man. Don't sweat it. The boss has got the jet fueled and ready.
blink, and we'll be in Monaco.
I take it everything went well. - Like a dream.
great. I'll tell the pilot we're ready to take off.
if you have any other loose ends...Now's the time to speak up.
Nope. No loose ends.
wait, what was that? You...what, you think of something?
no, man, it's nothing. It's...it's all good.
look, if you're holding something back and the boss finds out about it later, he's gonna drop your body off that jet.
there is something.
it's just this bitch. Okay?
I beat her down. I-I put her in the hospital.
is there a problem?
no, we're fine. We're just working out one last little...kink.
some bitch in a hospital bed?
then you need to take care of it.
what do you mean, take care of it?
little poison in the I. V.and she'll sleep forever.
kill her?
listen, you can wrap this up or you can hang here with your boys, wait till they rat you out, and let the cops drag you.
it's your choice.
clock's ticking.
okay. I-I'll do it. I'll put the bitch out of her misery.
a soldier on the battlefield would never dream of intentionally putting a dangerous weapon in the hands of an enemy.
but as a spy, sometimes the only way to solve a problem is trusting a bad guy to do what comes naturally.
and if you help with the plan, you know exactly how to make them fail.
drop it! Put the needle down!
what, man? Get off of me!
get him out of here! - Get off of me, man!
I was set up! I was set up!
you got him? - Great.
I would have felt so guilty if something bad would have happened.
no, uh, I'd rather not give my name. I don't even know the guy. I'm just a citizen doing my duty.
Hey, hey! That's the guy! That's the guy who set me up! That's the guy!
it's open.
I just got back from the hospital.
it's still touch-and-go with Heather, but she's through the worst patch, so...
I'll be by her side every day. - Good.
Sam called with some more good news.
looks like Ramsey's enjoying his jail time with all the guys he ratted out.
I'm offended he didn't call me first.
I thought we were friends.
I should tell you...I did some thinking, and I'm having lunch with those CIA recruiters next week.
what is it?
well, I was wondering... Does, um, does it ever get any easier?
no. It never does.
well, can you at least tell me this...if you could do it all over again, would you?
it's who I am.
I don't know how to be anybody else.
not really an answer, but I guess, uh, I guess it'll do.
take care of yourself, Michael.
w-wait, so that's it on the forensics, then?
I want answers, not excuses.
all right, you know what? Don't even bother.
I don't want to read a 20-page field report on how you found nothing.
Langley's all over my ass, Michael, and my leads are evaporating left and right.
Max's financial records, nothing. Traffic cams, nothing.
you better have brought me something to chew on. Thank you.
could be something.
found a burner cell in the records you gave me.
phone was purchased at a bodega on 6th.
they have a security camera?
you already got the footage.
I don't want to know how. I just want answers.
already sifting through the tapes.
I'll have something to report soon.
you'll have a report for me tomorrow.
isn't that what I just said?
I'm counting on you here.
so is Max's family.
mom? Got your call.
did you find something on the tape?
Michael, you need to tell me what this is all about right now.
I already told you. My friend
you told me that the security tape would lead to the man who killed your friend.
and I know you've spared me some details.
I need them now.
the person who killed my friend went to a lot of trouble to make it look like I did it.
I'm hoping the real killer is on that tape.
you need to see this.
he has your posture, your...your walk.
he's got you down, Michael.
good luck convincing anybody else it isn't you.
so nice to finally meet you, Harold.
you can call me Root.
when she took Finch, Root killed a former intelligence operative named Alicia Corwin.
you should be trying to figure out what I want and where we're going.
where are we going?
the future, Harold.
I've got a lead on Finch.
you know where our mystery woman's headed?
no, but I think I found out where she's from.
pack your bags, Carter, we're going to Texas.
911. What is your emergency?
Hello, who is this?
it's about Hanna, the girl who's gone missing.
so what's this all about?
what do you mean?
I promised you guys that round of drinks.
it's 8: 00 AM.
which means Finch has already been gone 24 hours, but we're gonna get him back.
this have a raw egg in it?
the alcohol will kill the salmonella.
you find out anything on the girl, Carter?
Yeah.
1991, 14-year-old Hanna Frey walks out of the public library in Bishop, Texas, never to be seen again.
she'd be 35 today.
seems about right.
that girl became Root, and now she's got Finch.
nothing else about her in any national law enforcement database since, John.
look, I need to know where you're getting your information.
I can't tell you that.
but we find out what happened to her, we find Finch.
this girl... Been gone 20 years without a trace.
how long you been drinking?
we're going to Bishop, Texas, to find out what happened to Hanna Frey.
what about me?
I need you to stay here, Lionel.
work the Alicia Corwin case.
find out why Corwin was in New York, and find out who's messing with the case.
maybe this'll help.
did you just jack my phone?
it's a malware app.
little tip- someone offers you a great deal on any sort of male-enhancement pill, don't click on it.
Oh, another thing.
I need you to look after a friend of mine.
bear, remember Lionel?
where are we on the Corwin mess?
a few loose ends to clean up, but I wouldn't worry about the evidence trail.
consider the chain of custody broken.
we need to find out what brought her to New York.
I think I have a lead on where she was staying in the city.
just make sure you get there first.
no telling what kind of smoking gun that nut job left lying around.
a dead nut job.
used to work for Denton Weeks.
let me worry about Weeks.
what do we know about the assigned working the case?
I wouldn't sweat that too much.
not exactly New York's finest working on this one.
okay. Lucky you called when you did.
deer season just started.
booked up solid for the week.
Oh, I don't think so.
we're gonna need another room.
afraid I can't help you there.
I've got three RVs backed up in the lot looking for a room with running water.
Thanks. This won't be a problem.
so what exactly are the sleeping arrangements?
I don't plan on sleeping much.
and if I do, the bathtub will - the floor will be fine.
let's go down to the police station and get ahold of that case file on Hanna Frey.
OK. Wait.
let's set up some ground rules here.
you keep a low profile and let me deal with the local law enforcement, all right?
that's why you're here.
it's regarding the Hanna Frey case back in '91.
Oh, yes, ma'am, I remember it well.
what's your interest in the case, Detective, uh... - Carter.
I may have a missing persons case in the Bronx that matches the MO.
a young girl went missing from a public library, like Hanna Frey, and one of my suspects used to live in Texas.
Really? What's the suspect's name?
unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to share names.
still a developing case.
sheriff, I'd really just like to have a look at Hanna's case file.
Yeah, well, I'd really like to have the name of this suspect, seeing as how it might help break a case that's haunted this department some 20 years.
right.
unfortunately, my loo hasn't signed off on a joint investigation.
I don't see why not.
he sent you all the way down here, didn't he?
sign here, please.
well, hello.
what happened to Dan today?
he got rerouted.
well, that is too bad.
mind if I use your restroom?
Oh, help yourself.
it's just down the hall and to the left.
all right, I'll tell you what.
why don't you give me the name and number of your loo, and I'll call him myself.
no?
well, that's too bad.
well, I hope you enjoy your stay here in Bishop.
hunting and fishing, second to none.
what the - Is that what I think it is?
plenty of leads to follow up on.
here.
I don't know what you just did, but this is not the way
there was even a 911 call from someone claiming they saw Hanna get into the car that night.
they gave a plate number too, but it didn't check out.
what do you think?
I think we start from the beginning.
we need to talk to whoever saw Hanna last.
she's still out there, Carter.
I'm telling you, that girl became Root.
amazing.
we've managed to perfect the apple - a genetically modified version that never goes brown.
and yet, we still haven't upgraded human beings.
the human race has stalled out, Harold.
and from what I've seen, most of it is rotten to the core.
Oh, Harold, generous to a fault.
always letting someone else take credit for your work.
I'd recognize your code anywhere.
it's so... elegant.
then let it be.
I told you, I don't want to control your machine.
then why are we here?
we're here to observe another kind of code.
the bad code.
clearly, we differ in our views of humanity.
do we?
then why are you the father of a seismic shift in intelligence, forced to live in fear and anonymity?
you don't know anything about me.
Oh, but I do, Harold.
you're the man who sold the world.
just to the wrong people.
I will get access to the machine, Harold.
and either you can show me how to do that, or this sad specimen will.
Denton Weeks - the man you sold the machine to.
one of you will walk out of here onto the next stage of our adventure.
I do hope it's you, Harold.
of course I remember.
I only wish I could forget.
Hanna was a bright girl.
mostly kept to herself.
did you notice anything off about her that night?
not really.
she was at the computers over there.
like she was almost every night.
we didn't have internet back then, just a couple of PCs and a few games.
educational, of course.
you gave the police a list of everyone who was in the library that night?
Yes. Thank you.
the library was about to close.
everyone was leaving.
I see you found the new Stephen King.
I really enjoyed the last one.
Thanks, Barbara.
damn it.
death by dysentery again.
that game's so dumb, Hanna.
I don't see why you play it.
because I'm gonna get to Oregon.
the library will be closing in ten minutes.
bring any books you'd like to check out to the counter.
see ya. - Bye.
Hanna checked out a couple of books.
thank you. - Good night, Hanna.
and then she was gone.
that's the last time anyone ever saw her?
I had no idea there was something to worry about until I got a call from Sheriff Landry in the middle of the night saying Hanna never made it home.
her parents still live here?
her mother passed a few years ago.
I still see her father every once in a while.
ma'am. Thank you.
you don't believe Hanna could still be alive.
that was my wife's curse.
refused to believe Hanna was gone.
thought she was still out there somewhere.
do you have any idea what happened?
of course I do.
everyone in town knows what happened.
the cops interrogated that son of a bitch for over two days.
it wasn't the first time he followed her home, but they can't prove a damn thing without a body.
then one night, me and my brother paid Cody a visit.
did you get the truth?
the smirking son of a bitch said he never touched her.
said she probably ran to escape her jerk of a father.
what ever happened to Cody?
most nights I hear he's rotting his guts out at The Razorback.
thank you.
anyone ever reach out to you after Hanna was gone?
any correspondence or information that might help us?
nothing except some credit card junk mail a couple times a year.
but they were in Hanna's name?
did she have a credit card or a bank account?
no, she was still a minor.
you got one of those letters?
I threw out another one a couple of days ago.
probably still in the trash.
Hey, you think it's odd that Alicia Corwin didn't have her hotel key on her person?
maybe she left it at the hotel.
maybe she left everything at the hotel.
because that's not the only discrepancy between what's listed in evidence and what's actually here.
Yeah, ballistics report was corrupted too.
someone really wants this to go away.
you find that person, maybe you'll get some answers.
and, Fusco, be careful who you read in on the case.
Yeah. All right. I'll talk with you later.
okay.
look at the guy in the suit.
Cody Grayson.
Hey, Wall Street.
you lost?
end of the bar.
look at this guy.
who's that?
Hello, Cody.
I know you?
you knew someone I'm looking for.
you a journalist or a fed?
neither.
good.
get off of him!
I asked you nicely.
let's try that again.
what did you do with Hanna Frey?
what do you want me to say, man, that I cut her up, dumped her in the swamp?
ain't nothing you can do this town hasn't already done worse.
what happened to Hanna? Where is she?
if I knew, maybe I'd still be able to see out of this eye.
let me guess - Cody Grayson.
I thought I'd buy him a round.
making friends, huh?
Yeah, you'll never get the truth out of anybody like that.
I already did. He didn't do it.
I could have told you that.
looks like you might be right about Hanna Frey.
junk mail with her name on it.
ran a credit check.
discovered a bank account opened in her name back in '93, two years after she disappeared.
so either Hanna's communicating from beyond the grave, or... - She's still alive.
can you please make this stop?
another hour in that hood, and he'll believe anything I say.
amazing how easily the human brain can be manipulated.
but you know that, don't you, Denton?
a top-secret DOD memo authorizing enhanced interrogation techniques, including "Palestinian hanging," which you are currently enjoying.
whose signature is at the end?
why, it's yours.
please... water.
sorry, not allowed.
unless you tell me what I want to know.
lady, I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm a White House lawyer.
I sign documents. I don't read 'em.
please, for the love of God, let me down.
if you tell me where the machine is.
what machine?
the machine he built.
the machine Nathan Ingram sold you for one US dollar.
you know where it is.
I don't know anything. I swear.
really, Harold, why do men always seek to delay the inevitable?
what happened to you?
me?
you think I was damaged?
some childhood trauma?
that is so sweet.
let him down.
please.
well, you did say please.
water, please.
Oh, we need to get this show on the road.
and since you just drank half a pint of sodium pentothal, that gives me time to go gas up the car.
by the time I get back, you'll be ready to spill everything in your little head.
you.
I know you.
you work with Nathan Ingram.
you have to help me get free.
we have a major problem.
she cannot get access to the machine.
assuming Hanna runs away, a couple years later, she winds up in Lafayette, Louisiana, opens an account, 100 grand is paid in, withdrawn in cash over the next three weeks until the account is closed.
100 grand.
where does a 16-year-old runaway get all that money?
jose Barilla, currently serving 17 life sentences for drug trafficking and murder.
the money was electronically transferred out of his account.
you did say this Root woman was good with computers.
Yes, I did.
but where does the account lead us?
right back here.
there was a co-signatory on the account.
a guy named Trent Russell.
local address, right here in Bishop.
name sounds familiar.
Yeah, he was on the witness list, in the library that night she disappeared.
you still got that address?
who is it?
Mrs. Russell, it's Detective Carter. Is your husband at home?
Mrs. Russell?
uh, yes.
Trent Russell is your husband?
can we talk to him?
Trent passed away almost 15 years ago.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
can we come in?
Oh, come in.
we were only married a few years.
we met at the library.
Trent was a member of the monthly book club.
I miss him so much.
how did he die?
it was awful. He was attacked.
shot to death.
they know who did it?
police said it looked like a drug killing, some trash from over the border, but never caught them.
Trent was a bank loan officer.
is it possible he got caught up in money laundering?
no, he was a good man. It was just a mistake.
how long did he know Hanna Frey?
he didn't.
then how do you explain this?
he signed for a bank account in her name two years after she disappeared.
this must be some kind of mistake.
Yeah, just like his murder.
you mind if we look around the place? - Yes, I do.
you need to leave now.
that 911 call.
the witness who saw Hanna get into the car - there was a license plate.
Oh, hold on.
caller.
it's about Hanna, the girl who's gone missing.
I think I saw her get into a car outside the library.
the operator asked about the make of car, but the only thing the caller can remember is the license plate - 925 ESK."
the caller got one digit wrong.
or the operator did.
are we saying this is the car?
Trent Russell kidnapped Hanna Frey?
maybe - maybe Russell took her, but she escaped.
she got her revenge.
how can say that?
because of the bank account in Russell's name.
it's how Root works.
she set him up.
she stole 100 grand from a drug dealer.
when he found out it was missing, the person he went after was Russell.
Russell denies it, but it's useless.
his name is on the account.
the only other name is that of a girl who's been dead for two years.
he has to be lying.
please, please!
so the man who kidnapped Hanna gets gunned down in a parking lot.
and his victim is in the wind, 100 grand the richer.
it's Root.
it has to be Root.
we need to search that house.
we need to call the Sheriff.
we need to handle this the right way, John.
she'll come back soon.
I know you're reluctant to trust me- you don't know me
Oh, I do know who you are, Mr. Weeks.
you tried to hack the machine.
I certainly tried. It was my job.
I had to test its limits, see if it was safe.
but in all of our crisis scenarios, we never envisioned this.
that someone would get to one of us.
she won't get to the machine through me.
but you must see that if you don't help me get free, we will lose the machine.
what can I do?
the knife.
try to push it to me.
stop. Stop it!
don't worry! Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill her.
at least not until I've found out what she knows.
so... Ingram's little IT guy.
we always suspected the idiot in the tux couldn't have done it on his own.
what do you want?
I want to know what you know.
flowers For Algernon.
the book Hanna checked out that night at the library.
16 copies hidden in your bedroom.
Where'd you get 'em?
they just come... every year.
every year on the same date.
what date?
april 15th.
the day Hanna disappeared.
they just arrive from all over the country.
no note, no sender.
like someone just wants to be cruel.
the most recent book did have something.
I'm gonna find out who bought it.
you stay here.
she's not done yet.
she really sent me over the edge.
so what's your plan, Mr. Weeks?
tidy this up, get some real experts to question this bitch.
but since anonymity means a lot to you, and because you helped me,
I'm gonna let you go wherever you want.
just one more question.
can she get to it?
I need to know if it's safe.
you are the one man who can tell me.
please.
it cannot be altered remotely.
if anyone wanted to change anything, they'd have to have physical access to the servers?
that's right.
so if the location is hidden, the machine is safe.
that's all I need.
it's been an honor to meet you... at last.
what did I say, Harold?
bad code.
Hey, here he comes.
heard you were staying here, buddy.
not now, fellas.
think it's time for a rematch.
don't think you're gonna sucker punch me again.
this is Detective Stills, NYPD Homicide.
I'm calling about a book you sold at the beginning of April,
flowers For Algernon. I need to trace the buyer.
911, what is your emergency?
it's about Hanna, the girl who's gone missing.
I think I saw her get into a car outside the library.
what sort of car?
I don't know.
it was a dark car.
do you remember anything else?
Yes, the license plate.
it goes on.
the girl was asked but wouldn't give her name.
then she hung up.
barb knows who it is... don't you?
Oh, it's Sam Groves.
she was in the library that night with Hanna.
she was friends with Hanna?
Hanna looked out for her.
flowers For Algernon. You should read it.
it's awesome.
damn it.
death by dysentery again.
that game's so dumb, Hanna.
I don't see why you play it.
cause I'm gonna get to Oregon.
the library will be closing in ten minutes.
bring any books you'd like to check out to the counter.
see ya. - Bye.
Sam was 12. Funny kid.
lived with her mom outside town.
mom wasn't well.
I guess that's why she always hung around the library.
why are you sure it was Sam made the call? There were other girls there.
it was Sam.
how do you know?
because she told me the same thing.
she said she saw Hanna get into a car.
barb, why didn't you tell me?
because Sam saw who was in the car.
and she told you, didn't she?
she said... she thought it was Mr. Russell.
why in the hell didn't you say anything?
I did. I did say something... to her.
I told her she was a nasty, attention-seeking brat, and I couldn't believe she'd think such a terrible thing about somebody like Mr. Russell, who'd done so much for this town and the library and all the children.
and then I told her to keep her lying little mouth shut.
Why?
because I was in love with Trent Russell, and I couldn't believe he'd do such a thing.
what do you believe now?
the patio?
he redid it, two weeks after Hanna disappeared.
Yes, this is Detective Stills, NYPD, calling in connection to a missing-child case.
a transfer was made from an account at your bank to a bookstore in Seattle.
account name was Von Neumann.
last four digits, 4253.
Hey, buddy, uh, no trouble.
we just need to get our stuff, you hear? - Police business.
whoa, whoa. We're good.
Yes, I'm here.
found something.
same book.
Yes, I need to check for recent activity on a credit card in the name of Dyson.
gas station in Relton, Maryland?
just after 4: 00 AM.
about three hours ago.
gotcha.
you knew I'd help him, didn't you?
you let him beat you up, take your gun - you planned the whole thing.
that's who you gave your machine to.
violent and predictable people.
but you must see I'm on your side.
I'm not on any side.
you know what I mean.
I am the best friend, the best support, the best partner you will ever have.
and definitely the most fun.
no. You're worse than Weeks. You're worse than all of them.
I'd rather die than give you the machine, so please kill me now.
at least I won't have to listen to you anymore.
you're tired...
and I'm bloody.
I'm gonna go clean up.
Carter, you can keep the rental.
guys are lending me a truck.
why is there a crossbow on the bed?
long story, but we're friends now. Gotta go. Got a line on a private jet in Galveston.
where are you going?
back East.
look... this book led us to a bookstore, to a bank, to a bank, to a bank, to a credit card, which was used in Maryland about three hours ago.
it's Root.
Hanna is Root. She's alive, and I know where she is.
she's not Hanna.
Hanna's in the ground, John.
she's dead.
she never did get away from Russell.
then who'd do this?
who sent the books, got Russell killed?
Hanna's father gave it to me.
her name's Sam Groves.
she was Hanna's friend.
she saw Hanna get into Russell's car that night.
she told Barb, called 911, but nobody would listen.
where is she now?
only child. Her mother died about ten years ago.
so Sam left town, was never heard from again.
if anybody's Root, it's gotta be her.
then she's the one who took Finch.
I know where she is.
I'm going after her.
who is this guy?
looks like I found Corwin's hideaway.
Hey, it worked. How do you say that in Dutch?
nothing here.'Cause they beat you to it, smart guy.
forget it, we got a bigger problem.
Denton Weeks - he's disappeared. He's not answering any of his phones.
you got any leads?
it seems Weeks had a woman on the side.
get down. - Julie Davenport.
apparently, they used to sneak off to her love shack outside of DC.
just find it.
sorry I took so long.
a mild sedative.
I apologize, but I need you to be a little more... amenable.
well, well, it seems I underestimated your knuckle-dragging friend.
how he got there I do not know.
did the machine help him, do you think?
something for us to discuss on our journey.
I hope you like trains.
come on, Harold.
one more question, and then I'll leave you alone.
Where's the machine?
this time, it is loaded.
now, where did you move the machine?
I'm telling you, I don't know.
wait.
july 12, 2009, it was boxed up and put on a train.
with that amount of servers, of course it was a train. But a train to where?
it started in Des Moines.
then it was transferred to Union Pacific railway, bound for Salt Lake City.
and that's all I know.
that's a start.
you have no idea what you're getting into.
Harold... did you think I'd forget to disconnect the phones?
off we go.
I just landed in Maryland.
I'm at a gas station.
she was here this morning.
I've been trying to reach you for hours.
have you got something, Fusco?
I think the broad who took your friend is also going after a guy by the name of Denton Weeks, who's in the same type of government business as Corwin was, and he's missing.
the feds are flying around trying to find him.
you know where they're looking?
apparently, he's got a girlfriend who's got a cottage outside of DC.
all I got is a name - Julie Davenport.
search property records in Relton, Maryland, for a Julie Davenport.
I just want to see if the train's on time, Harold.
can I remind you of our deal?
try anything, innocent people get hurt.
tap code. Finch... Really?
train station.
the outbound train with direct service from Baltimore to Salt Lake City will be departing from track seven.
you'll like the West, Harold.
fewer people, bigger skies.
more space to think.
how did he find us?
because you're wrong.
he proves you're wrong.
not all humans are bad code.
you helped him.
I told you what would happen if you tried to get away.
excuse me, sir.
can I help you, ma'am?
help! Shooters!
don't move. Don't move.
am I hit?
I don't think so. Sorry it took so long.
I really didn't intend for you to come and find me, Mr. Reese.
there are other people that need your help.
well, you saved my life once or twice, Harold.
seemed only fair I return the favor.
Hey, yourself.
Where's the dog?
Wonderboy came and took him.
so we got our friend with the glasses back, huh?
Yeah, we did.
buy you a drink?
long as it don't have egg in it.
Harold, meet Bear.
unfortunately, my apartment has a strict policy regarding dogs.
I have a strict policy regarding rare first editions. Namely, don't eat them.
bear, laat vallen.
Asimov.
he has expensive taste.
I'm sure we'll get along.
Gabriel Wyath, 26.
engineering student... diagnosed about five years ago.
delusions began to grow increasingly vivid and violent, eventually requiring hospitalization.
Gabe has successfully masked his issues for so long that by the time that anyone was aware of the extent of his problems, his delusions had convinced him to try and blow up a government building.
so what are we looking for when we make a diagnosis of schizophrenia?
well, many patients develop a routine to help them maintain the illusion of control.
double Americano. Extra shot. Skim milk.
extra hot. Thanks.
black coffee?
despite this, they outwardly exhibit disorganized or odd behavior.
I don't think that's what I ordered.
which can lead to confusion and agitation.
where did you put the Alderman file?
who the hell is Alderman?
see?
right where I said it was.
they might suffer from coexisting sleep disorders, including insomnia.
the majority of cases become unstable without medication.
good.
the issue lies in what happens when a patient refuses treatment.
many will endure confusion, anger and risk harm to themselves and others, all in an effort to cling to things that only they see and understand.
that's what makes these patients so dangerous.
the delusions that drive them also convince them to try to hide the depth of their problems.
our challenge is to...
try to find a way to help someone who doesn't want it.
the risk lies in...
the damage they can do if we fail.
so tell me how this works.
I'm awake with my wife, and I close me eyes, I open them... I'm awake with my son.
and this has been happening since the accident?
so you began working on one case here in reality, and then suddenly you begin working another case there, in your dream.
it all feels completely real to me.
you can't tell whether you're awake or asleep at this very moment?
well I can assure you, Detective Britten, this is not a dream.
that's exactly what the other shrink said.
dad, the school says they don't have the permission slip.
you told me you turned it in.
how am I not the account holder if my name is on the bill?
n-no, don't put me...
I gave it to the teacher, the guy with the... thing on his head... I'll call him.
you can't call. They had to be cleared last week.
and I'm sorry, I'll take you to museum myself... how's that?
it's not about the museum. It's about the fact that now I have to spend the day in study hall because you didn't turn in a simple piece of paper.
I'm telling you, I'm pretty sure I gave...
the guy something, unless I gave him the phone bill.
well, no, no, no. I'm talking to my son. Don't, don't...
listen, how could it take you three days to switch the service back on when you have my money today?
hold on a second.
yeah?
I'm on my way.
Hello?
Hello?
all right. You ready to go? I told you yesterday, Cole's dad is taking me.
I'll text you when I'm out. - No, you won't.
your phone's not gonna be on for three days.
What?! It's gonna be back on on Wednesday.
the phone company messed up. I'm sorry.
those prints come back? You asking me, Detective?
Mike, glad you could make it. Len's waiting on us; the prints came back.
Really?
they originally made it for the astronauts.
I'm telling you, I sleep like the dead in this thing.
I'm not spending half my pension on a mattress.
half?
we're talking about an astronaut bed, man.
I'm pretty sure I spent my whole pension and probably a little of yours.
what?
well, first of all, there's coffee in it. Look, Len...
I dropped the thing, okay?
no. There's also a ring missing. - What?
Yeah, there's one...
two-fingered brass knuckle ring, with the word "WILD" inscribed on the top.
look. No, no, no, no.
see, I picked everything up and put it all back in here. I made sure.
this is why I tell them not to let you guys take it out of the property room.
do me a favor... it's a ten-cent knockoff. It's got nothing to do with the crime.
could you do some... Lenny magic, make it disappear?
just don't do it again. Okay?
I owe you a large beer, my friend. - Y-You owe me a ring.
never should've got out of bed this morning.
you know, I had that same feeling, but it's 'cause I was very comfortable.
that astronaut bed... ooh.
come on...
I wasn't the one who was too tired last night.
just eight minutes of your precious time.
eight minutes? It takes me eight minutes to get these clothes on.
six. No. You're going the wrong direction.
how about 12 minutes and a police escort?
and that is my final offer.
how about lunch?
lunch? - Yeah.
sure. All right.
but tomorrow we stay in bed all day. Deal?
deal.
there was totally a sign there, and you blew right through it. There was no sign.
let's go back. - I'm eating.
because you know it was a stop sign. No.
when we get to the station, I'm gonna write you a ticket.
all units, Code 3. Possible hostage situation.
Vista Psychiatric Hospital. 11347 Vista Heights.
seven William 43 and 45, responding Code 3.
come on. It's okay. Come.
what's up?
guy claims to have the whole place wired with explosives.
he's got himself barricaded in there with about 15 other patients, doctors and nurses.
we've set up a perimeter and already started evacuation. This is the head nurse in charge.
he is a patient. His name's, uh, Gabriel Wyath.
he just started screaming he was gonna blow the whole place up, and then he locked down the high-risk wing from the inside.
you see these explosives? They look real to you?
he's got a bunch of acetylene tanks with wires sticking out of them.
detective, he's on the phone. - Who?
the patient. He wants to talk to whoever's in charge.
you're the senior officer.
this is Detective Britten.
who am I talking to? It's Gabe. Okay. It's Gabe.
you have to stop the noises. Stop the sirens. Okay?
I can't hear my thoughts and I need to hear what I'm thinking or...
okay, Gabe.
hold on a second. I'll see what I can do.
let's have all units respond Code 2.
seven William 45, have all units respond Code 2.
hold on a second, Gabe.
all right. How's that? Gabe, is that any better?
Yeah.
thank you.
thank you. N-Now, which one are you?
raise your hand.
that's me.
right here. You got me?
I see you. You look okay.
Thanks. All right, Gabe, listen.
here's what I need you to do:
I need you to let all those people you're holding walk out of here.
No! No! Don't, don't... Hold on.
I tell you what I need. Okay? That's how this works. Okay?
that's how it works! Okay? - All right.
all right, Gabe. I'm sorry.
so, what do you need? I need you to bring me my sister.
okay? I know they have her.
I know all about it. Okay?
I-I just need to see her... talk to her. Okay?
I-I just need to... to see her.
all right, Gabe. Give me a little time and...
what did he say? He wants to see his sister.
you know where I can find her? - You can't.
she was murdered about four years ago.
great.
we estimate there are 25 hostages.
he's got them locked behind these sally port doors, here.
here we go. Everyone, this is Dr. Lee.
he's worked with the patient extensively.
we're just trying to get a thumbnail of what we're dealing with here.
well, what we're dealing with is a very intelligent and very troubled individual.
was actually a rising star in a government research lab when his condition started to become apparent.
he lived with his sister, Christy, until four years ago when she was murdered in a dispute with an ex-boyfriend.
Gabe responded to her death by creating an elaborate conspiracy theory in which his sister was not murdered, but abducted by agents from the lab where he used to work.
despite our best efforts, he's... he's grown increasingly delusional.
doctor, bottom line:
is this a guy we're gonna be able to reason with?
as long as he's allowing his actions to be dictated by things only he sees or hears, it's unlikely.
very well.
this is a high security building. Apparently, Gabe has overtaken the command room.
so, he can use all the measures designed to keep the patients in to keep us out.
realistically, we're looking at 12 to 14 hours to try a full breach.
our only immediate option is to try sniping him through the small western window.
but if we're gonna get a clean shot, we're gonna have to maneuver him into position.
the negotiator's trying to work out a trade to get one of our guys inside.
see if we can't...
direct him. - He won't let anyone out, but he's agreed to let someone in that can help him find his sister.
we can work with that. - There's one complication.
he's saying he will only take the officer who helped him with the noise.
detective Britten. - Absolutely not.
how else are you gonna take the shot?
once you're in, ease him toward the west side of the drinking fountain.
that's where we've got the best shot.
excuse me.
honey. Babe.
I know you're gonna think I'm crazy; what if we try that Lebanese place again?
no, I can't.
I know, but they say that the lamb's gotten so much better.
no, no, I mean, a situation came up at work.
I... I got to take a rain check.
how?
okay, well, what about dinner? Dinner would be great.
you know that I love you, right?
Yeah, I love you, too, babe. I'll see you tonight, all right?
see ya.
...not have been evacuated, which all over a dozen people that remain inside this building.
apparently, one officer has been admitted in and is attempting to reason with Wyath.
???? no comment.
we don't know what his demands are.
no stranger though, this man, to this sort of violence, Wyath was arrested in late 2008
when he entered a municipal building with explosives strapped to his body.
shortly after this, he was transferred to the high-security wing of this facility...
this is Detective Michael Britten.
please leave me a message, and I'll call you back as soon as I can.
y-you're not at this hospital scene I'm watching on TV, right?
okay, listen to me... Where is he?
Where's-where's-where's Michael?
we had a situation, and he didn't want you to worry.
my God. My God!
Sh-Show me you're clean.
I got nothing on me, Gabe. Just like you told me.
okay?
so let's stay calm. Just sit down.
what did they tell you?
they told me to come in here and help you find your sister and bring her to see you.
did they tell you that I'm making it up?
because that's how they dismiss you. How they try to get rid of you.
Yeah, they did.
I'm not imagining things.
my sister is real, and she's alive, and whatever they told you, she doesn't deserve this.
she's the only one that ever understood.
when they tried to split us up, take me away because they said that I was sick, that I wanted to hurt people, she wouldn't let them.
she fought them, and instead of letting them haul me off to a place like this...
...she took me to one like this.
she looks nice. She protected me.
I let them take her.
I should have protected her.
and I didn't.
but now I need, I need to get her. I need to get her back.
and that, that's what makes me sick?
don't you think I would be crazy if I wasn't trying to save her?
Yes.
look.
look at this. No! No, no, no! No!
No!
okay. They think that I can't see through this? I mean, but it's practically obvious.
Gabe, can I ask you something?
what is that in your hand? I know you're there!
this? Yeah.
this is a dead man's switch.
it's what triggers the bombs, Detective.
I let go...
boom.
it's how I'm gonna keep them honest.
as long as I don't let go, everything's fine.
but if they try something... No!
No!
excuse me.
this is how we'll find her?
this map?
that's where Dr. Wilde has her.
Dr. Wilde?
two-fingered brass knuckle ring with the word "WILD" inscribed on the top.
he's holding her.
he's got her in this secret underground location.
they think that she's gonna talk about my research, but I keep telling them that she doesn't know anything.
but they won't even admit that they have her.
how can you reason with someone when-when they say that she's not even alive?
right. Will you shut up!
I'm trying to tell him where Christy is!
shut up! Please.
shut up!
shut up!
I said, shut up! - No! No! No!
No!
get away from the window!
sierra One, I have visual on suspect.
you got a green light on the shot.
shut up!
let go! No, Gabe. Calm down.
you tried to kill me! No, no, I'm trying to help you!
the switch... I can pull the wire from the transceiver, and it's the same thing as letting go of the button!
don't-don't do any... - Do you want me to do that?!
no, no, no. Okay, I'm not touching it. - Let go!
get away! Stand up!
all right, let's just calm down, okay? Gabe?
turn around! Okay.
I need you to stay calm, Gabe.
if we're gonna try and help you...
shut up! I can't think!
I can't have you causing this kind of trouble.
all right, let's just slow everything down, okay, Gabe?
Gabe! Let us out of here!
Gabe! Gabe! No!
come over here and talk to me! Gabe, don't!
that'll kill him! Gabe, don't do it!
no, Gabe!
it's me.
that missing ring turn up? The one that said "WILD"?
sorry.
your dad didn't notice you carrying two bowls?
I don't think he would have noticed if I'd had two heads.
he's acting weird lately. Why?
Why? I don't know.
you don't ask?
it's none of my business.
sure it is.
he could be getting fired.
or, I don't know, he has a tumor. Or he could have an eating disorder.
he doesn't have an eating disorder. No?
how would you know if you don't ask?
we just... don't talk about stuff like that.
would you know if your parents had an eating disorder?
totally. We practically tell each other everything.
Yeah?... Where do they think you slept last night?
in your bed.
you're serious.
Yeah.
they practice progressive parenting.
as long as I tell them the truth, they trust me.
they must want to kill me. No.
they'd be more mad at you if they found out you were giving me this.
a lot of processed sugar.
so you're allowed to sleep over at your boyfriend's, but you can't have Cap'n Crunch?
progressive parenting.
see if the cleaning crew found the ring, will you? No need.
guy pled guilty this morning. Case closed.
Really? You sure? Yeah. He took 18 months.
after that, well, I'm sure he'll be a model citizen. There's something wrong there.
we got to find the ring.
need to find it? Why?
I mean, you said yourself it's not important to the case, okay?
we got enough real work here.
I don't need you out there hunting, looking around for cheap jewelry.
now, if you feel bad, you can send the guy a carton of cigarettes.
look, can you ask them to keep looking?
okay, look, I'll ask them, all right?
Mike, you still there?
Yeah. So when you coming in?
no, I, I got to stop and see someone first.
tell me about psychiatric drugs, the kind you inject.
something that might cause hallucinations.
an anesthetic like ketamine, for instance, could have that effect. Why?
the last thing I remember before I woke up this morning, I got shot up with something...
maybe ketamine. I don't understand how...
there's this guy, a mental patient, he's taken some people hostage in a hospital, and I was sent in to diffuse the situation.
he attacked me and injected me with something, and-and...
you mean in your dreams. I don't know what's going on now.
are you experiencing hallucinations?
no.
this ring that you're missing, you said that it wasn't important to the case, and yet you feel compelled to find it. Why?
the guy's looking for a after a Dr. Wilde, and the ring's got "WILD" inscribed on it.
I see.
and this psychiatric patient, what exactly is the nature of his illness?
he's a schizophrenic.
would you say that you're frightened of him?
he's got the building wired to explode, and I'm inside it, so...
you know, so I'm a little bit frightened.
what if I told you that that sounded like a positive step?
I'd say that's not exactly how it feels.
through this missing ring, you have linked yourself with a schizophrenic, a man who's unable to distinguish fantasy from reality.
but in this situation you've created, your own well-being depends on neutralizing him, on defeating him.
and on some level, that means that you've acknowledged the danger presented when someone refuses to see things for what they are.
you're saying I'm dreaming to tell myself to stop dreaming?
I'm saying, right now, it's a missing ring, it's a permission slip, it's a phone bill.
but what you're really afraid of is what all that might point to.
you're having a nightmare about madness, Detective Britten, because somewhere inside, you fear that if you continue to deny the reality of your situation, this is where all that could end.
what are you doing?
you see a ring around the house?
like, a two-finger gold thing with the word "WILD" written across the top?
no. Why?
it's evidence; I got to find it.
I'll let you know if I see anything.
Rex! Get down here!
come here.
did you take the ring?
I asked you a question. Did you take the ring?
I, I...
I didn't think anyone would notice.
it's evidence in a murder trial, son.
you can go to jail. I could lose my job. I figured it wasn't important.
and that's a good enough reason to steal? I wanted to give it to my girlfriend.
your what?
she likes that kind of stuff, and I can totally get it back.
what girlfriend? You don't have a girlfriend. Yeah, I do.
since when? I don't know. A few months.
no. You would have told me.
you told me about the last one. The-the, the blonde one.
I didn't. Mom did.
right.
I know since she died, you want us to suddenly be, like, all cool, whatever.
but you're, you're still my dad. What does that mean?
I don't know. We just...
we just don't talk about stuff like that.
so you were gonna, what, send me a wedding invitation?
look, your mother's not here.
we don't have... your interpreter any more.
it's just you and me.
and if we want to make this work, we're gonna have to put some effort in.
I'm-I'm doing my best. You got to do it, too.
okay?
so, tell me something about her.
she got a name? Emma.
she worth stealing for, this Emma?
I'm sorry.
I'm supposed to see her tonight.
if you want to get the ring back, you could, you know...
meet her.
is it wrong that I still think it's romantic?
yeah... a little bit.
but he's gonna get you something he has to actually pay for, right?
Yes. You kids still wear those big clocks, right?
I like him! Why haven't I met him before?
Yeah, Rex, why not? I don't know.
all right, that's enough torture for one night.
you're not staying? No. I got what I came for.
it's nice to meet you, Emma. It's nice to meet you.
okay.
sorry, that's the way we do it in my family.
it's just, Rex and I are still at the, the high-five stage, but we're working on it.
just wait till you get home?
Dr. Lee, what are you doing in here?
they convinced Gabe to let me in. You got a pretty big dose of ketamine.
you'll probably feel the residual effects until it wears off.
you'll stabilize in a couple of hours. Easy.
how is he? What's he doing? Well, he's been...
what? What's going on?! What are they doing?!
Yeah, they're coming in.
they cut the power off.
means he can't control the doors or cameras.
who turned off the lights, Turn the lights on!
turn them on! Turn the lights on!
what does that mean?
it means SWAT's trying to find a way to come in here...
and shoot a man who's wired to explode.
why won't they just bring her to me?
Gabe, I need you to let me make a phone call or they're gonna come in here.
I won't let that happen.
I can still stop them. Please?
look, you want answers to your questions, don't you?
if they come in here and everybody dies, then you don't get any questions answered.
so, please, let me make a call.
Vega. Tell SWAT to stand down.
Gabe has a dead man's switch.
tell SWAT. - Stop! Stop!
let's break 'cause the guy's got a dead man's trigger.
we shoot him, the whole place goes up.
stand down. Stand down. Everyone hold your position.
for now.
okay, they're holding. What do we do?
I-I need you to look into a couple of things.
Gabe says his sister's being held by a Dr. Wilde.
is there anything on file? Dr. Wilde?
I don't know. I'll check.
and see what you can dig up on a trip he took with his sister just before she died.
trip? To where? To a beach or something.
okay. Thank you. All right, I'll see if I can find anything, and I'll get back to you. It's gonna take a little time.
you know, sometimes I see her.
here, in my room or...
she'll just be beside me walking down the hall.
I know she's not...
I-I know she's not really here, but it just feels so good to be around her again.
they keep saying that-that I... see things that aren't there.
but that's not my problem.
you know what my problem is?
no matter how hard I try, eventually,
I stop seeing things that aren't there.
that's why I had to do this.
I don't want to imagine seeing Christy any more.
I want it to be real.
all right?
yeah?
I've got no reference to Dr. Wilde anywhere.
not in the lab where he worked, not where he went to school, no one he's ever seen for treatment, nothing.
he's holding her.
he's got her in this... secret underground location.
I also don't have anything about a trip in '07.
all the records say that at that point, he was in pretty heavy therapy and afraid to travel.
all right. Keep looking.
they're getting somewhere. Just need a little bit more time.
okay?
doesn't make sense.
what?
Vega says there's no way this guy took a trip in '07.
maybe that's not what it refers to.
maybe. Did he find out anything more about Dr. Wilde?
no, Wilde's not the name of a doctor holding Christy underground, it's the name of the cemetery where she's buried.
there's got to be something here.
detective Britten, this is a huge step.
the fact that he's taken this detail and put it into his narrative, it demonstrates that, on some level, he remembers burying Christy in that cemetery.
on some level, he knows that she's dead.
if guided properly, we can help him to understand that there is no sister to bring to him.
we can end this standoff.
you want me to tell him his sister is dead?
isn't that exactly what you've been doing for years? It's different this time.
it's not you telling him, it's him telling you.
these glimpses of-of a healthy mind buried under layers of delusion and denial are rare.
it's up to us to properly seize them, to guide him.
I don't know. I don't think...
what are you talking about?
all right, look, Gabe...
I wasn't completely honest with you before.
I do have information about Christy.
do you know where she is?
since your wife's funeral.
there's no world in which your son survived the accident.
she escaped.
nobody was meant to know, because this place they were holding her underground was meant to be inescapable.
honestly, they thought it was impossible. But she did it.
Christy got out.
she beat them, Gabe.
and-and she managed to leave a message for you.
and Dr. Wilde, of course, was trying to keep the whole thing a secret.
what did she say?
she wanted you to know that she was okay, that she was free and happy, and she was never gonna let anyone catch her again.
and she promised that someday, someplace, you will see her again.
the last line just read...
I love you, Trip.
she's okay.
Yeah.
she's okay.
how did you know his sister called him Trip? I didn't.
I saw it on the picture, and his name was Gabriel Wyath III, so I figured I'd give it a shot.
I don't understand. Trip. As in triple.
nickname for third.
so you had the opportunity to help this patient see the truth, but you chose instead to perpetuate his denial. Why?
how would he be better off, thinking of his sister in the ground somewhere than-than thinking of her free, liberated, waiting for him?
explain to me what exactly is so great about seeing reality for what it is?
you've more or less summed up the reason why every major religion has some version of an afterlife.
the part you ????
you built a story about the costs of living with fantasies, and you allowed it to point you back to all the things that get lost in the shuffle between these worlds, like this relationship of your son's.
but when you came face-to-face with the larger revelations, you backed down.
you retreated into a-a scenario where you save the day, you play the hero, win the affection of the wife you've feared losing, and the approval of the therapist who's expressed doubts in you.
just like Gabe, you hold the keys that will tell you what's real and what's not.
but for the moment, you're unwilling to turn them.
what's that?
my God, I remember this.
you and Mom used to read this to me, like, every night.
for years.
Gabe didn't need to be forced into some kind of revelation for his story to turn out okay, so why are you so eager to do it to me?
detective Britten, you are comparing yourself to a schizophrenic whose delusions led him to be institutionalized.
I'd strongly prefer if we find a way to help you before you get that far.
well, didn't you feel frightened? Frightened?
Yeah, of course. Who wouldn't? Didn't you?
Absolutely.
but then, I wasn't inside like you.
after I advised you on-on how to approach Gabe, they put me in this secured van, in case I could be useful.
Dr. Lee?
but as it turned out, you did fine without me.
are you all right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I feel a little... strange.
it's probably the drugs wearing off.
I think you're finally making some real progress.
at this point, the best thing is probably for you to just...
it was designed to keep you breathing, but you never wake up again.
then, having fizzed your brain, it clears your system in minutes.
so, if things have gone to plan, we would never have even known to look, because we would never have known it had happened.
she was going to piggyback his heartbeat while it took effect, then rig him back up once it had.
clever plan. Except, sadly for her, turned out to be a game of two halves.
and her identity?
the thing is, Sir, we were hoping you might be able to help us with that.
me? How? -There were no guards at the door.
now, again, if nobody had known anything had happened, no one would have any reason to ask why the guards weren't there.
but that's not how it worked out, is it?
and now we have.
it was you, Sir.
and what do you intend to do with that information?
I think, more importantly, what is it that you intend to do?
because one of the cleverest killers since the Borgias knows that you just tried to kill him.
so what do you think he is going to do next?
it's time to call the cops, Sir!
only be careful who you call, 'cause around here, no one's who they seem.
be with you in a second, Gabriel.
who is she? In the hospital?
one of mine.
the one you had on Glickman?
a little extra tab? And looking for him when he disappeared?
and I presume she's the one who found him.
why'd you try to kill Gatehouse?
things were getting messy.
was it going to be me next?
you should never have let him get so close.
I wanted to see where it led.
and here we are, sitting in your office.
time to put your pictures in a box, don't you think?
Oh, and whatever you do, don't make a fuss before you leave.
I could certainly make a noise about you.
but then it would just be me giving the eulogy at your funeral.
and I only want to be thinking nice thoughts.
see, that's the trouble with you and your fast track.
when you hit a dead end, it's too late to break.
you're out, David.
and you want to start enjoying the benefits of your efforts in your charming little cottage in the Dales?
stay in line. Or start running.
you've got no one to blame but yourself.
what did you tell him?
take an early bath. His pay scale, he can afford it.
are you going to throw another blanket on this?
no. No, no, you can pick him up.
give him a couple of days to collect his thoughts.
I sense a promotion. -For you?
well, for both of us. You got your man, Gabriel.
what if it doesn't end here?
Oh, but it does.
it ends here.
I've supported you up to this point, because I knew he was a bad fucker but you go any further with this, you're going to start fucking with me.
you've done brilliantly.
brilliantly, just like I knew you would.
you should also know when to quit.
so quit now.
I think you're going to look pretty good in my suit.
what the fuck happened to you?
well, I need the next payment, yeah?
when? -Wednesday.
you'll have it.
so are we back in business?
I was never out.
you sitting this one out?
Yeah, just like you told me. Do you remember?
it's interesting, though, isn't it?
Harris's death, Ratallack's deal, you taking over.
it's almost like you planned the whole thing.
Shh. Don't be so noisy.
what's your plan for me, Jay?
ain't got one, Joe.
just as long as you stick to yours.
do you remember that, that rowing fellow?
who won all them Olympic medals?
and he said that if he ever got back in a boat again, -then we should shoot him. -Yeah.
he did, though, didn't he?
just so you know, if he'd have said that to me,
I would have.
yeah?
we're on.
she didn't fall, Joseph.
Yeah, she did. The nurse said she fell down the stairs.
she said she threw herself.
no.
it does happen. I've seen it before.
but when I left her this morning, she wasn't confused, she was quite calm.
sometimes, at this stage of the illness, the mist is kinder than when it clears.
but I'm not sure if this is the right place for her any more.
you want to take her away?
this time it's a fall, next time it could be worse.
I think we should put her in care now, yes.
I'm so sorry. -But I'm nearly there.
nearly where?
I've got a plan.
you can't beat this, Joseph. -We've got a plan.
change it.
change it now.
you know that journalist, Mc Govern?
he got killed. Motorbike.
Yeah.
makes you think, though, doesn't it?
what of?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I've got to go.
alone.
Why? -It's Laura.
commander Penney. -Are you alone?
out here.
it was me gave Gatehouse the money.
Why? -Because he worked for us.
us? -Counterpoint.
I thought you worked for the police?
a secret cell.
who set it up?
when he was Commissioner?
head of Special Branch.
1970... -Nine.
Oh. -No, it's not what you think.
we used the change of government to cover it but they weren't involved.
although we did turn to Section 5. -What for?
people. -Gatehouse?
he Secret Service? -Was.
he's Counterpoint. He has been, for 30 years.
he runs it?
the field, yes. We run the money.
I thought you were retired?
I am now.
and a man named Halton.
from 5?
and Paul Travis?
dead. Years ago. Cancer.
so just Khokhar and this Halton? No one else?
what did it do?
counterpoint, initially money laundering.
who for?
set up to be a sting.
Gatehouse started with small dealers, no idea who we were.
but he'd gain their trust, turn their money.
word spread, it grew.
like a card game. As it got bigger, so did the players.
finally, we got to a deal of 70 million, and with that, we thought we could bring the house down.
so, we went to the DPP, like a good cop should.
first strategy of arrest.
what did he do?
he shut you down.
he said it would never stick in court.
well, it's entrapment.
and as we'd shown him our hand, he told us to fold it, with immediate effect.
so, officially, we did as we were told.
we shut it down.
unofficially?
we made the deal.
seventy million.
into an account that didn't exist.
and then what?
we decided to play again.
but this time, we decided to stack the deck in our favour.
how?
by buying the players in the first place.
actually, it was his money man, Peter Glickman.
Gatehouse found him.
we gave him the cash flow, he linked up with Wratten, didn't tell him about us. And away they went.
200 million turnover.
per annum? -Mostly.
40 million net. -Of which you took... ?
ten percent of all sales.
into Counterpoint? -Correct. It became completely self-financing.
you still had to clean the money. -Oh, yes.
and we did that, too. -How?
trust me, one day you're going to thank me for this.
pensions, insurance schemes, yours, mine.
everyone's who worked for the Force.
this whole thing's about pensions?
for the benefit of all.
Really?
so does everyone get a boat like this or did you just tell yourself that when you bought it?
without us to plug the gap, the whole fund collapses.
it's government-backed.
how many schemes need to fail before it isn't?
we look to the future, son. Which nobody else does.
you're dressing this up as altruism. How sick is that?
we provide for the future, your future.
Harvey Wratten didn't get one and he was one of yours.
Gatehouse gave him an opportunity to retire. He didn't take it.
so you made him by putting him in jail?
and then Glickman had this crisis of loyalty and told him about us.
and Harvey threatened to tell everybody else unless we got him out.
so, get him out we did.
so then you gave the money to Gatehouse?
to buy drugs to give to Customs to get Harvey a Royal Pardon.
and when he got it,
I think we might have left it at that, everybody.
it was so compromised.
but Gatehouse decided to close Harvey's book.
so that's what he did.
and we've been cleaning up ever since.
so, who had the money marked?
I did. -Why?
gatehouse. He was starting to behave like he was his own boss.
I thought he might be setting the whole thing up just to run away with it.
it turns out money wasn't his primary concern.
for him it's all about control.
isn't it ironic?
one bit of police work I actually did, it's the bit that catches me out.
because if you hadn't marked the money...
Delaney wouldn't have spotted it. -And he wouldn't have told me.
and we wouldn't be here.
he's starting it again, you know.
who? -Gatehouse.
whole new set of players.
who are they?
you think you can stop this? He'll kill you.
he hasn't yet. -You can't stop this.
that's what we were trying to do.
look what's happened to me.
I can protect you.
it was foolish of me to think you could even try.
I didn't want a cup of tea, anyway.
No! No!
that was pretty low, Gabriel.
I had to go alone.
he wouldn't have taken any other excuses.
don't you trust me? -Should I?
around here, no one's who they seem.
I'm a police officer. -Oh, yeah. That card thing.
doesn't really rub, though, does it?
does with me. -Yeah?
me, too. -Then we're together on this.
I thought for you this was just a job.
it is, with you, every step of the way.
forensic OFFICER: Sir Richard Halton.
honey: Who are they? -I'm handing over.
what? Why?
section 5. He was, they are.
Gabriel: So what have you got?
well, it's been over 24 hours.
he appears to have suffered a blow to rear left side of his head.
what kind of blow?
what kind?
it may well be consistent with the fall.
Gabriel: Consistent, but not conclusive.
listen, after they finish, there won't even be blood.
you know how they are with their own.
what the fuck? Where's Khokhar? -He's disappeared.
well, put a wanted out on him. -I already have.
if we don't find him first, that fucking lunatic-looking vicar will.
Oh, and Honey's your gun girl, right? -Yes, sir.
then have her stick to you like tassels to a stripper's nipples.
sir, we should go to the press. -Oh, what with?
suicide and a domestic accident?
find that fucking Gatehouse!
before he buries us all.
what's going on here?
he's got a potential shadow in the line.
Whose? -Harvey Wratten's successor.
his name's Joseph Bede.
he runs a flower import business, he's completely clean, but then he would be.
that's how he'll bring it in. In the flowers.
the trick is knowing which shipment.
get it wrong, you'll never get it right.
so, who's the shadow?
he's right at the centre, so he'll have to disappear for good.
how much is he looking for? -Quarter of a million.
Yeah, and I'm looking to support Barack Obama, but some things you're just never going to get.
do you know, I thought we could get together on this, cops, Customs, like the happy family we're supposed to be.
if it's any consolation, I also hate my brother.
what's he bringing in? -400 kilos of heroin, single shipment.
street value 22 million.
he's starting it again. -Who?
what if I could get you the money?
all of it? -What if I could?
the we got ourselves a shadow.
come, please, sit down.
you want some food? -No.
you need to eat. -You sound like my dad.
do I know your dad? -He was an arsehole.
an arsehole who wanted to see his son eat.
only thing is I'm not much with family.
no? -No.
cause with me, it's either business or family. It can't be both.
then you and I, I think, will have little in common.
because you inherited your business from your father?
well, the thing is you didn't know, did you?
you know, I've known you since I was like, Well, that big.
and the truth is you've always been a bit of a hero of mine.
if I could window my house with flattery, I wouldn't need the glass.
and I remember you had an elder brother.
didn't you?
and that's who your father left the business to.
but he was noisy, wasn't he?
everywhere he went, everyone knew he was coming.
until one day, he just didn't turn up ever again.
and then there you were, shh, quietly taking control.
just like your family should have given it to you in the first place.
Oh, it's hard though, isn't it?
waiting for that moment to come.
I mean, that is strength.
real fucking strength.
maybe you should have taken a little strength for yourself before you went clacking back to your uncle with the cops in tow.
but the thing is, though, Mr. Babur. Mr. Babur.
maybe I've taken it already.
maybe that's what I was doing all along, taking your lead.
it's never nice to watch an old man refusing to leave a disco, is it?
and I cannot tell you how many times Harvey had been asked to quit, right?
but he just kept on wiggling.
silly old sod.
until in the end, someone had to bundle him off the dance floor.
you.
by leading the cops to him.
you understand now, don't you?
family or business.
so, let's talk business.
you giving it in?
I'm taking it back.
where to?
where it came from in the first place.
Oh, Jonah.
Laura, I still don't know who I am.
or what I am.
what I've done to you is unforgiveable, I know that.
I want to start to make it better.
I want to make it all better for you.
and the baby.
doing this is the way I can.
I love you.
I thank you.
there's 230 there.
he can whistle for the rest.
where did you get it from? -From where this all began.
but as far you're concerned, it doesn't even exist, you understand me?
Ooh! Are you offline on this, then, Detective Inspector?
no, I'm right back on it.
200, minus my 10 percent.
what?
and if Julie Christie offered you one, would you still pull that face?
okay. -Ah, ah, ah.
there's someone else you've got to kiss first.
so, what's the story?
it's whatever you want it to be.
man: Clear!
clear!
clear!
Oh, I could arrest you for that.
you arrest someone? Now, that is a laugh.
you knew it was a setup.
no. How could I have known?
they've been working me for months. I would've put my life on it
Yeah, well, maybe you just have.
where is he?
you seriously expect me to know that?
move on, move on.
Yes, move on.
I'm going to bust your arse!
you've been stung.
I have. We all have.
it hurts.
bloody happens.
you must know something. People like you always do.
I think you bust a rib.
you got a wife?
what?
kids?
you threatening them?
no, but you are.
it's just a job, Beatty. It's just a job.
Yeah, and this is me doing it.
you just don't get it, do you, boy?
do you know how long I've been in this business?
almost 30 years.
now, do you know how I get to survive this long?
it's by not knowing.
it's knowing gets you killed.
so, do you know what I think you should do now?
you should go home.
just go home in that car you're always checking.
but this time, don't even bother to lock it when you get there.
tell them how much you love 'em and that you're the luckiest man alive.
and it'll be true and do you know why?
because you never even got close.
shit!
magic.
it's all about getting them to look elsewhere.
and never telling anyone how the trick was done?
never.
good.
and finally, we are done.
we are.
what about your end buyer? Have you exchanged yet?
I do that next.
five million.
five million.
you don't want to go again? -No.
stick to the plan? -Yes.
it was a clever one.
thank you.
how is your wife?
these are the ties to bind.
my daughter makes them.
give one to your wife, keep one yourself, then when you are alone, you will never be apart.
remember, I warned you if there is a human in a plan there will always be a flaw?
yours is Jay Wratten and he knows how your trick worked.
so watch out, I think he means to play one on you before you go.
Why?
was it your Johnny Cash who said "I'm giving up" right before he came back?
it certainly wasn't me. -Isn't that what they all say?
good luck, Joseph Bede.
what are you going to do with that? -Jay.
you're not...
no. But he's likely to try it on me.
always knew he would.
you know you can't use that?
no, it's marked. -So what are you going to do with it?
you know, I was born near here. -Yeah?
Yeah.
not like this.
it's a shithole.
I'm sorry I got too old.
at least you got there.
what am I going to do when you go?
stick to the flowers.
no.
it's a cut-throat business, that one.
Hello?
goddamn it!
she's in our care now.
I'm sorry, Joseph. -It's not over.
it's not.
it's all right, darling, I'm here.
let go of me.
let go.
please.
let me go.
have you lost something?
well?
with all the money you're about to collect, there is nothing you won't be able to buy.
nothing!
ready when you are, Joseph Bede.
just a minute.
I love you.
you should go home.
this is my home.
working late, Detective Inspector?
it's you that keeps me up.
I can tell you where Khokhar is, if that'll help you sleep.
if you can, it means he's already dead.
there's more where he came from.
like who?
we should meet.
you really think?
Yes, I really do.
the lines have changed, Gabriel.
penney and Khokhar, they tried to have me killed.
so, now, my enemy's enemy...
isn't that ironic, me calling you?
where?
people don't do bad things just because they want to stroke a white cat.
all they thought they were doing was protecting their family.
and if you'd have stayed within it, they'd have protected you.
with a pension.
no one else is going to pay it.
that's why they had to start it again.
to make sure it would continue.
you shot Harvey Wratten.
I shot Harvey Wratten.
and who'd you get to take his place?
the one that got Harvey busted in the first place.
hidden depths, that one.
plus a kid over on Bob Harris's side. Quite a whiz with numbers.
a new Wratten and Glickman.
and who's going to run 'em?
why didn't you kill me when I was in hospital?
you seem so good at it.
I would have.
but Khokhar told me not to. -Why?
he'd been urged to change his mind.
by who?
most people, they just see the surface.
him, he looks to the bottom of the pond.
he certainly saw inside of you.
you work for him?
we've come to share the same sense of order.
by putting him up there?
and you beneath.
and how are you going to do that?
how you going to stop me?
a gun.
trained on you.
now.
and all I have to do is wave my hand, and she will shoot you.
why are you doing this?
because it matters.
for other people to see you, standing out there in all that bright, white light?
I'm sure it does matter.
the problem is, Jonah Gabriel, that kind of glare, it just turns you blind.
because all I have to do is this, and your light goes out.
No!
you'll get over it.
I'll live with that for the rest of my life.
well, at least now, when you hit 55, you'll be able to do it in style.
leave the gun at Khokhar's feet, then come back here and get in the car.
Why?
he doesn't belong here.
Ah! Questions, questions.
which I'm sure Detective Inspector Honey can answer.
we're not looking for anyone else in pursuit of this enquiry.
so you believe Commander Khokhar shot Detective Inspector Gabriel before hanging himself?
Yes. We do.
because?
because, Detective Inspector?
you're really trying to rub it in, aren't you, Michelle?
would be nice.
because as you've no doubt already read it in our statement, it appears DI Gabriel discovered that Commander Khokar had stolen a considerable sum of money from the department.
how much? -250, 000.
all in bank coppers?
we found Gabriel's car outside a remote cottage owned by Khokhar, and the three casings from the bullets used to kill him near a pathway leading up to it.
so, whatever way you want to add it up, Michelle, it still cost one of my best officers his life.
and where is this money now?
we believe it was thrown from a rooftop in Central London.
so where it is now, well, quite frankly, it could be in any one of our pockets.
so, you know, please feel free to have a whip round.
do you have any comment on the murder of Joseph Bede?
the flower man? No.
but it is true that Customs conducted a recent unsuccessful raid on one of his premises?
well, you'd have to ask them that question.
I'm sure they can give you a much fuller answer than we can.
Yes, but wasn't Bede murdered in the same way as Harvey Wratten?
when you're shot, you're shot, Peter.
you don't think there is a connection?
between what?
between Joseph Bede's murder and DI Gabriel's, given it was Harvey Wratten's murder Gabriel was investigating at the time?
we've long since turned that particular page, Peter.
and I believe it was your newspaper I was reading when we did so.
so, for the record, you don't see there's a connection?
are you meaning all this in a Jungian sense?
you know what I mean, Commander.
then, for the record, there is absolutely no connection between Jonah Gabriel and Joseph Bede.
so now it's our turn. -Yeah.
for how long is that going to last?
I think you know the answer to that already, and if you don't, you should.
twenty years, and then a headshot in the back of a car?
not if you remember the rule.
yeah?
and what exactly is that?
simple.
you, you're the threads.
but me,
I'm the rope.
midwife: Okay, Laura, you're doing really well.
it's almost here.
I need one more big push from you.
give me a push now.
it's out.
here's your boy.
hello.
you know, it's funny, but in my business, you can't ever wash them enough.
now, then.
let's take a look at you, little fella.
there you go.
well. I look forward to working with you, little man.
you can't have him now.
no? Well, let's wait a few years.
at least until we can buy him a playsuit.
you can't have him now.
um, I don't follow you.
he's mine.
in here, in my memory.
and all I choose to remember is the best of him.
and you can't take that from me.
ever.
and you will never take my son.
I didn't kill your husband.
but it's what you represent that did.
Oh, and is that how you're going to bring him up?
Jonah on one side, us on the other?
he'll know right from wrong, yes.
is it really that simple?
Yes, it is.
do you know what, Mrs. Gabriel?
I don't think there's anyone, you, me, your husband, even this little fellow here when he grows up, who can absolutely say, without any shadow of a doubt, what side of the line they stand.
no.
I think the best that any of us can ever hope for is, well, just to walk it.
I hope you like the room.
Jonah paid for it.
Yes, yes, he did. Of course, he did.
that's... That's what insurance is for.
and it doesn't stop here, as you know.
so, whatever you choose to tell him, we'll still make sure his every need is catered for.
because if there's one thing you can be absolutely assured of, Mrs. Gabriel, we always look after our own.
dismount!
Herman's horse-sick!
chaps, no one wander off.
some of the passageways in here can run for miles.
I don't think this is such a good idea.
what is it?
Alfred, did you get anything yet?
nothing.
then keep digging.
the kid's got something!
Whoo! Yee-hoo!
I got something, Garth!
I got something... I got something right here.
Oh, look at that!
Whoo!
we're rich! We're rich!
shut up. Shut up.
well, we're rich, ain't we?
what are they doing?
Shh!
Hey, we got to find more stuff to bring back.
it's the Cross of Coronado.
Cortez gave it to him in 1 520.
Ah! Oh, boy! Whoo!
I'm thinkin' about raisin' my dead mama, dig down and put it on her bony finger!
that cross is an important artifact.
it belongs in a museum.
run back and find the others.
tell Mr. Havelock that there are men looting in the caves.
have him bring the sheriff.
it's only a snake.
did you hear what I said?
right. Run back...
Mr. Havelock... the sheriff...
what, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I'll think of something.
dig with your hands, not with your mouth.
he's got our thing!
get him! -Get off me!
Mr. Havelock!
anybody!
everybody's lost but me.
there he is!
let's go! Let's go!
Hey! Hey, you! -Dang it!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hey!
come back here!
come on! Get him!
Hey, come back here!
Oh!
Aah... Oh!
here, let me.
Oh, oh...
holy smokes!
come on, kid.
there's no way out of this.
Hey!
toss up the whip.
you got heart, kid, but that belongs to me.
it belongs to Coronado.
Coronado is dead, and so are all of his grandchildren.
this should be in a museum.
now give it back!
a snake!
snake! Aah!
don't let him get away!
magic?
hold it.
make sure he doesn't double back.
okay, kid, out of the box, now.
son of a...
damn.
dad!
dad!
dad.
dad... Out.
it's important.
then wait. Count to 20.
no, Dad. You listen to me.
one, two, three, four...
in Greek.
may he who illuminated this...
illuminate me.
I brought the sheriff.
just the man I want to see.
now, there were five or six of them...
it's all right, son. -They came after me...
you still got it?
well, yes, sir.
it's right here.
I'm glad to see that...
because the rightful owner of this cross won't press charges if you give it back.
he's got witnesses, five or six of them.
Whoo! Yeah!
good day.
you lost today, kid, but it doesn't mean you have to like it.
small world, Dr. Jones.
too small for two of us.
this is the second time
I've had to reclaim my property from you.
that belongs in a museum.
so do you.
throw him over the side.
grab him, he's getting away! Stop him!
archaeology is the search for fact...
...not truth.
if it's truth you're interested in,
Dr. Tyree's philosophy class is right down the hall.
so forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel, and digging up the world.
we do not follow maps to buried treasure, and "X" never, ever, marks the spot.
seventy percent of all archaeology is done in the library.
research. Reading.
we cannot afford to take mythology at face value.
next week: "Egyptology."
starting with the excavation of Naukratis by Flinders Petrie in 1 885.
I will be in my office if anybody's got any problems, for the next hour and a half.
Marcus, I did it.
you've got it!
Oh!
you know how long I've been looking for that?
all your life.
all my life.
well done, lndy.
very well done, indeed.
this will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
we can discuss my honorarium over dinner and champagne tonight.
your treat.
Yes.
my treat.
Dr. Jones! Dr. Jones!
shush! Shush! Shush!
Dr. Jones, I am so glad you're back.
your mail is on your desk.
here are your phone messages.
Dr. Jones, you promised...
this is your appointment schedule, and these term papers still haven't been graded.
okay. Irene, put everybody's name on a list, get the order they arrived...
Oh, come on, Dr. Jones.
Dr. Jones.
...and I'll see each and every one of them...
in turn.
Venice, Italy.
Dr. Jones!
Dr. Jones?
I trust your trip down was comfortable, Dr. Jones.
uh, my men didn't alarm you, I hope.
my name is Donovan.
I know who you are, Mr. Donovan.
your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous.
some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
well, like yourself, Dr. Jones,
I have a passion for antiquities.
have a look over here.
this might interest you.
well, it's sandstone.
christian symbol.
early Latin text.
Mid-1 2th century, I should think.
that was our assessment, as well.
where did this come from?
my engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.
can you translate the inscription?
...who drinks the water I shall give him, says the Lord, "will have a... spring "inside him welling up for eternal life.
let them bring me to your holy mountain "in the place where you dwell."
across the desert "and through the mountain" to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon, to the temple where the cup that...
where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever.
the Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.
the chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper.
the cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathea.
the Arthur legend.
I've heard this bedtime story before.
eternal life, Dr. Jones!
the gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.
now, that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to.
an old man's dream.
every man's dream, including your father's, I believe.
Grail lore is his hobby.
he's a teacher of medieval literature.
the one the students hope they don't get.
Walter, you're neglecting your guests.
be along in a moment, dear.
hard to resist, isn't it?
the Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail.
what good is it?
this grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons.
it's pretty vague.
where do you want to start looking?
maybe if the tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on, but the entire top portion is missing.
just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
let me tell you another bedtime story, Dr. Jones.
after the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathea, it disappeared, and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the First Crusade.
three brothers, to be exact.
I've heard this one, as well.
two of these brothers walked out of the desert 1 50 years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France, but only one of them made it.
and before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a... to a Franciscan friar, I think.
not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.
this is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight's story.
it doesn't reveal the location of the Grail, I'm afraid, but the knight promised that two markers, that had been left behind, would.
this tablet is one of those markers.
it proves the knight's story is true.
but as you pointed out, it's incomplete.
now, the second marker is entombed with the knight's dead brother.
our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.
as you can now see, Dr. Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost 2, 000 years ago.
we're only one step away.
that's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
you could be more right than you know.
yes?
we've hit a snag.
our project leader has vanished, along with all his research.
uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Dr. Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.
I want you to pick up the trail where he left off.
find the man, and you will find the Grail.
you've got the wrong Jones,
Mr. Donovan.
why don't you try my father?
we already have.
your father is the man who has disappeared.
your father and I have been friends since time began.
I've watched you grow up, lndy.
I've watched the two of you grow apart.
I've never seen you this concerned about him before.
dad?
he's an academic; a bookworm.
he's not a field man.
dad? Dad?
dear God.
what has the old fool got himself into now?
I don't know, but whatever it is, he's in over his head.
dad?
it's today's mail, and it's been opened.
mail.
that's it, Marcus.
Venice, Italy.
what is it?
it's Dad's Grail diary.
every clue he followed.
every discovery he made.
a complete record of his search for the Holy Grail.
this is his whole life.
why would he have sent this to me?
I don't know, but someone must want it pretty badly.
do you believe, Marcus?
do you believe the Grail actually exists?
the search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
but if you want facts, lndy,
I've none to give you.
at my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
call Donovan, Marcus.
tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
I'll tell him we'll take two.
all right, tell me what's going to happen when we get to Venice.
don't worry, Dr. Schneider will be there to meet you.
uh, Schneider? -I maintain an apartment in Venice. It's at your disposal.
Oh, well, that's good.
thank you.
Dr. Jones... good luck.
now be very careful.
don't trust anybody.
Ah, Venice...
Yes.
uh, how will we recognize this Dr. Schneider when we see him?
I don't know.
maybe he'll know us.
Dr. Jones?
yes?
I knew it was you.
you have your father's eyes.
and my mother's ears, but the rest belongs to you.
looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
that's right.
Dr. Elsa Schneider.
Oh, how do you do?
the last time I saw your father, we were in the library.
he was very close to tracking down the knight's tomb.
I've never seen him so excited.
he was as giddy as a schoolboy.
who? Attila the Professor?
he was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy.
will you permit me?
I usually don't.
I usually don't, either.
in that case, I permit you.
it would make me very happy.
but I'm already sad.
by tomorrow, it will have faded.
tomorrow I'll steal you another.
I hate to interrupt you, but the reason we're here...
Yes. I have something to show you.
I left your father working in the library.
he sent me to the map section to fetch an ancient plan of the city.
when I got back to his table, he'd gone, with all his papers, except for that scrap, which I found near his chair.
Roman numerals.
here is the library.
that doesn't look much like a library.
looks like a converted church.
in this case, it's the literal truth.
we are on holy ground.
these columns over here were brought back as spoils of war after the sacking of Byzantium during the Crusades.
now, please excuse me.
the library's closing in a few moments.
I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer.
Marcus... I've seen this window before.
where?
right here, in Dad's diary.
you see?
look, lndy.
the Roman numerals.
dad was onto something here.
well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
dad sent me this diary for a reason.
until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
find something?
uh, yes. Three, seven and ten.
that window seems to be the source of the Roman numerals.
my God, I must be blind.
dad wasn't looking for a book about the knight's tomb, he was looking for the tomb itself.
don't you get it?
the tomb is somewhere in the library.
you said yourself it used to be a church.
look.
three.
three.
seven.
seven. Ten.
and ten.
now where's the ten?
look around for the ten.
three and seven.
seven and seven and ten.
ten.
"X" marks the spot.
bingo.
you don't disappoint, Dr. Jones.
you're a great deal like your father.
except he's lost, and I'm not.
lower me down.
look after this for me, will you?
come on.
pagan symbols.
fourth or fifth century.
right.
600 years before the Crusades.
the Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
that's right.
if there's a knight of the First Crusade down here, that's where we'll find him.
what's this one?
the Ark of the Covenant.
are you sure?
pretty sure.
watch out.
it's petroleum.
I should sink a well down here and retire.
give me the lighter.
Oh, rats.
Ugh!
come on.
come here.
look, it...
it must be one of these.
look at the artistry of these carvings, and the scrollwork.
it's this one.
this is it.
we found it.
look.
the engraving on the shield, it's the same as on the Grail tablet.
the shield is the second marker.
what's that?
it's a rubbing
dad made of the Grail tablet.
just like your father-- giddy as a schoolboy.
wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
he never would have made it past the rats.
he hates rats.
he's scared to death of them.
get back!
back against the wall.
quick! Under it!
air pocket!
don't wander off.
what?
What?!
I think I've found a way out.
deep breath.
Ah, Venice.
Whoa!
are you crazy?! Don't go between them!
go between them? Are you crazy?!
I said go around!
you said go between them!
I said, don't go between them!
No!
why are you trying to kill us?
because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
my father was looking for the Holy Grail.
did you kill him too?
no.
where is he?
talk or you're dead.
damn it, tell me!
tell me!
if you don't let go, Dr. Jones, we'll both die.
then we'll die.
my soul is prepared. How's yours?
this is your last chance.
no, Dr. Jones, it's yours.
all right, where's my father?
if you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
who are you?
my name is Kazim.
and why were you trying to kill me?
the secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years, and for all that time, the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword have been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
let me off at this jetty.
ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ?
is it for His glory, or for yours?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ.
I came to find my father.
in that case, God be with you in your quest.
your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald, on the Austrian-German border.
how's the head?
it's better, now I've seen this.
it's the name of a city.
"Alexandretta"?
Hmm...
the knights of the First Crusade
laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year.
the entire city was destroyed.
the present city of lskenderun is built on its ruins.
Marcus, you remember what the Grail tablet said:
across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
but where exactly?
your father would know.
Mm.
your father did know.
look. He made a map.
he must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the Grail quest.
a map with no names.
now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east, here.
he knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains, here.
straight to the canyon.
he knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Alexandretta.
now we know.
Yes. Now we know.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah.
tell him to meet you in lskenderun.
what about you?
I'm going after Dad.
Oh! Oh...
my room...
mine, too.
what were they looking for?
this.
the Grail diary?
Uh-huh.
you had it?
you didn't trust me.
I didn't know you.
at least I let you tag along.
Oh, yes.
give them a flower, and they'll follow you anywhere.
knock it off. You're not mad.
no?
no. You like the way I do things.
it's lucky I don't do things the same way.
you'd still be standing at the Venice pier!
look, what do you think is going on here?
since I met you, I've nearly been incinerated, drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait.
we're caught in the middle of something sinister here.
my guess is Dad found out more than he was looking for.
and until I'm sure,
I'm going to continue to do things the way I think they should be done.
how dare you kiss me!
leave me alone. I don't like fast women.
and I hate...
arrogant men.
Ah, Venice.
what do you know about this place?
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
what are you going to do?
don't know.
I'll think of something.
yes?
and not before time!
did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day?
we're drenched!
now look, I've gone and caught a sniffle.
are you expected?
do not take that tone with me, my good man.
now butt off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant...
...are here to view the tapestries.
tapestries?
dear me, the man is dense.
this is a castle, isn't it?
there are tapestries?
this is a castle, and we have many tapestries.
but if you are a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse!
how dare he?
Nazis. I hate these guys.
this one. I think he's in here.
how do you know?
because it's wired.
don't worry... this is kid's play.
I'll be right back.
Yes, sir.
it is you, Junior!
don't call me that, please.
well, what are you doing here?
I came to get you. What do you thi...?
late 1 4th century, Ming dynasty.
Oh, it breaks the heart.
and the head. You hit me, Dad.
I'll never forgive myself.
don't worry, I'm fine.
thank God.
it's fake.
see, you can tell by the cross section.
No!
dad, get your stuff.
we've got to get out of here.
well, I'm sorry about your head, though, but I thought you were one of them.
dad, they come in through the doors.
good point.
but better safe than sorry.
hmm, so I was wrong this time.
but, by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my diary.
you obviously got it.
I got it, and I used it.
we found the entrance to the catacombs.
through the library?
right.
I knew it.
and the tomb of Sir Richard?
found it.
he was actually there?
you saw him?
well, what was left of him.
and his shield...
the inscription on Sir Richard's shield?
Alexandretta.
Alexandretta! Of course!
on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire.
Oh...
junior, you did it.
no, Dad. You did.
forty years.
Oh, if only I could have been with you.
there were rats, Dad.
rats?
Yeah, big ones.
what do the Nazis want with you, Dad?
they wanted my diary.
yeah?
I knew I had to get that book as far away from me as I possibly could.
Yeah.
Dr. Jones.
yes?
I will take the book now.
what book?
you have the diary in your pocket.
you dolt!
do you think my son would be that stupid that he would bring my diary all the way back here?
you didn't, did you?
you didn't bring it, did you?
well, uh...
you did.
look, can we discuss this later?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
will you take it easy?
take it easy?!
why do you think I sent it home in the first place?
so it wouldn't fall into their hands!
I came here to save you!
Oh, yeah?
and who's gonna come to save you, Junior?
I told you...
...don't call me Junior!
look what you did!
I can't believe what you did...
that's far enough. Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.
put down the gun, or the Fraulein dies.
but she's one of them.
Indy, please!
she's a Nazi.
What?!
trust me.
lndy, no! -I will kill her!
yeah? Go ahead!
No! Don't shoot!
don't worry. He won't.
Indy, please! Do what he says!
and don't listen to her.
enough! She dies!
wait! Wait...
I'm sorry.
no, don't be.
but... you should have listened to your father.
she ransacked her own room, and I fell for it.
how did you know she was a Nazi?
hmm?
how did you know she was a Nazi?
she talks in her sleep.
I didn't trust her. Why did you?
because he didn't take my advice.
didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Dr. Jones?
I misjudged you, Walter.
I knew you would sell your mother for an Etruscan vase, but I didn't know you would sell your country and your soul to the slime of humanity.
Dr. Schneider...
there are pages torn out of this.
this book contained a map, a map with no names, precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
so it did.
where are these missing pages, this map?
we must have these pages back.
you're wasting your breath.
he won't tell us, and he doesn't have to.
it's perfectly obvious where the pages are.
he's given them to Marcus Brody.
you didn't drag poor Marcus along, did you?
he's not up to the challenge.
he sticks out like a sore thumb.
we'll find him.
the hell you will.
he's got a two-day head start on you, which is more than he needs.
Brody's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan.
he speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom.
he'll blend in, disappear.
you'll never see him again.
with any luck, he's got the Grail already.
does anyone here speak English?
or even ancient Greek?
uh, water? No, thank you, sir.
no. Fish make love in it.
goodness me.
thank you so much.
no, I don't like that.
no, I really don't want...
no, no, thank you very much.
no, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.
does anyone understand a word I'm saying here?
Mr. Brody!
Oh, Sallah. What a relief.
Marcus Brody, sir.
but where is lndy?
Oh, he's in Austria.
a slight detour.
you are on your own?
Yes, but don't panic.
everything's under control.
have you, have you arranged our supplies?
Oh, yes, of course.
but where are we going?
Oh, this map will show you.
it was drawn by, uh, Mr. Brody.
welcome to lskenderun.
the director of the Museum of Antiquities has sent a car for you.
Oh, well... your servant, sir.
and I am his.
follow me, please.
my reputation precedes me.
there is no museum in lskenderun.
papers, please.
papers?
of course.
run.
Yes.
papers. Got it here.
just finished reading it myself.
run.
Yes.
"Egyptian Mail," morning edition.
run.
did you say, uh...
run!
okay, okay, quick, quick, quick!
find the back door! Find the back door!
intolerable.
Dr. Schneider. Message from Berlin.
you must return immediately.
a rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture.
so?
your presence on the platform is requested at the highest level.
thank you, Herr Oberst.
I will meet you at lskenderun.
take this diary to the Reichmuseum in Berlin.
it will show them our progress, ahead of schedule.
without the map,
I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.
let me kill them now.
no.
if we fail to recover the pages from Brody, we'll need them alive.
always do what the doctor orders.
don't look at me like that.
we both wanted the Grail.
I would have done anything to get it.
you would have done the same.
I'm sorry you think so.
I can't forget how wonderful it was.
thank you.
it was rather wonderful.
Oh, Dr. Schneider.
your car is waiting.
that's how Austrians say good-bye.
and this is how we say good-bye in Germany, Dr. Jones.
Oh!
I liked the Austrian way better.
so did l.
let's try and get these ropes loose.
we've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do.
you said he had two days' start.
that he would blend in. Disappear.
are you kidding? I made that up.
you know Marcus.
he got lost once in his own museum.
Oh...
can you try and reach my left jacket pocket?
what am I looking for?
my lucky charm.
feels like a cigarette lighter.
try and burn through the ropes.
very good.
Oh!
I ought to tell you something.
don't get sentimental now, dad.
save it till we get out of here.
the floor's on fire.
see? -What?
and the chair.
move! Move it out of here!
go!
it's scorching the table! Fast!
move! -Okay!
well, we have Marcus Brody, but more important, we have the map.
by the personal command of the Fuhrer.
secrecy essential to success.
eliminate the American conspirators.
germany has declared war on the Jones boys.
dad! -What?
dad!
what?
dad! -What?
head for the fireplace!
Oh.
I think I can get these ropes off.
Whoops.
our situation has not improved.
listen, Dad, I'm almost free.
alarm!
this is intolerable.
I'm out, Dad.
well done, boy.
come on, Dad.
dead end.
there's got to be a...
a secret door or a...
passageway or something.
I find that if I just sit down and think...
dad!
...the solution presents itself.
great. More boats.
you say this has been just another typical day for you, huh?
No! But better than most.
come on, Dad. Come on.
what about the boat?
victory!
CALUGARENI
for more than one hundred years,
europe has trembled under the attacks of the Ottoman armies.
1593
sultan Murad III urges his troops to Vienna, under Sinan Pasha's command, to defeat the last obstacle between them and a divided Europe.
as a miracle repeating over and over along the centuries, these armies have to face three insignificant principalities:
Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldavia.
all three would play a crucial role in this battle.
in these troubled times, a man would rise in the right place, to fulfill its destiny.
Patrascu's son was meant to perish, to flea or to win the battle, to become a prince.
michael THE BRAVE THE BATTLE OF CALUGARENI
eat, milords!
feed yourselves! I see you're weak!
or maybe you don't enjoy my lunch.
of course we do!
is it good? - Yes, it is!
do you hear me, Pavel? This will teach you to rise against me again!
spike him!
eat! Don't you like it? - Of course we do, Your Highness.
they're afraid of me. But it's the only way, in these times.
I am faithful to you, Selim Pasha. Tell it to the mighty sultan!
I gave you two chariots full of healthy children.
I know we don't have do it anymore, but...
I'd give you two chariots of gold, if you gave me you know whose head.
what if he deserves more?
voivode Alexandru has forgiven you!
no. As I haven't forgiven him.
Michael, I was always your shadow. I did what you wanted me to do.
our home has turned to ashes. We are hiding abroad.
the voivode has put a price on your head. Where will it end?
I'll go all the way, Stanca, no matter where it may lead me.
Alexandru's men are after me. I stopped just for a moment.
Where's Nicolae?
I hid him. - Where?
I'll take him with me. - No.
his life is in danger. Alexandru will want revenge, if he sees I'm gone.
no. You can't have him. - I'm not used to this kind of words.
you should learn. You've taken everything from me, Michael.
even if you succeed, you can't give me back my serene and short happiness.
don't worry! No one will touch my son. Not even you.
especially you.
as you have risen against him, Voivode Alexandru has ordered your capture, General of Craiova!
not inside the church.
I fear a trap.
you're handsome, but stupid, Hassan.
don't you understand? I made a promise.
there's too much silence.
they, too, feel something in the air.
Selim Pasha...
the Buzesti brothers...
you're right on time, Mihal. How did you get away?
it was easy, Selim.
Radu... Father Stoica... Brothers, let them pass this time!
only this time.
but without the children!
nobody move!
for the love of me, let them pass with what they have!
these are children from our land.
why, Michael?
without his help, I can't go to Istanbul.
I know him well enough to know he never let his pray loose.
Selim is my childhood friend. Please, let him pass!
make way! Let them pass!
Michael!
mother...
you, too, have sold them your soul. The son of Voivode Patrascu...
you don't care about anything! You want the throne at any cost!
you'd cover yourself in shame! I damn you for all eternity!
you stand and watch your foe mocking your people!
don't curse me, mother!
the Prophet's teachings are great, but I still don't understand.
why do you need to rule over such a wretched country?
I want to be the mightiest man in this country.
Mihal, my friend... Here, we are the mightiest of all.
look at me!
which one of you is stronger?
does anyone dare fight him?
you! Come here!
do you want this knife?
Yes, sir.
you have to earn it. - I will, sir!
punch him!
beat him!
do as I tell you!
do as I tell you!
wait!
now you beat him!
enough!
get up!
kill him!
these are my children, Mihal.
what's your name?
Hassan. Before, when I was ugly and dirty, it was Ionica.
now it's Hassan. You can kill me, you're still an unfaithful to me.
you learned to contain yourself, but not entirely.
had I not loved you, I would've had to kill you.
maybe you'll be sorry you didn't do it.
you haven't changed, Mihal.
selim, I want to ask you something. - I'm listening.
why did you join Sinan Pasha's army?
Allah whispered to me that one day I could become grand vizier.
you're dreaming, Selim.
Mihal, will your uncle Lani give you the money?
I don't know.
two days ago, Alexandru offered me two chariots of gold for your head, and now I'm losing mine, going along with you.
Allah didn't give me the brains my mother would've wanted him to.
this one will make us rich.
if he's willing to pay this much, how much money does he make?
let him pay! We'll settle later.
Mihal! Alexandru's here.
Lani, give him whatever he asks for!
think again, Michali! This is a great deal of money.
no. We'll pay what he asks.
come on! Move! Get out!
we need another 300000 coins.
I gave you my entire wealth. I swear on my beard!
I'll pay you back. - Yes, but you know how it goes...
520000 coins in all. This means 543000, interest included.
I told you it's not enough. - Sign here!
I talked to Di Ventini, the richest banker of the Genovese quarter.
he's waiting for you. - Di Ventini...
you won't see a coin from him. - Why, Selim? How do you know?
he won't pay even his respects.
I'm sorry, Signor Michele, but I'm afraid I have to say no.
Rosana!
this is Prince Michele.
if there is any other problem, I am your humble servant.
Rosana, you entertain the prince!
my brother Carlo is the image of our much praised impetuosity.
I am Rosana.
I'm curious... Could you tell me the subject of your conversation?
I'm sure you heard everything, Contessina.
it's so exciting to see men fight for their goals!
you then start to see their weak points, their touching side.
you didn't plea for your cause too well.
I'm not used to asking. - Then how will you get anything?
I've been living here for many years. It's a strange world.
the shortest way is never the right one.
a smile may bring death, while a frowning, life.
let me ask you something! How old are you, Contessina?
prince... Is the house of Di Ventini your last option?
Yes.
what if you don't get the money? - I die.
you don't seem a man of simple judgments.
Contessina Rosana, have you ever thought that there are men who wait to watch the sun?
for them, this moment may never come, but they still are trying.
what did the dame say? She's the one who runs the business.
what did she say? Tell me word for word!
she said this was a strange world. - Will she give you the money?
I don't know. She didn't say anything.
is she beautiful? - Why?
this means you've grown older than me.
Mihal, think it over! We still may leave tomorrow, alive and well.
my money...
Ventini afendi...
please, come in, Your Excellency!
Signorina Contessa, I'm your humble servant.
my sister was so curious to see your true oriental decorations, that she convinced me to take her with me.
today I tried to look at the sun. It's hard.
my eyes were full of tears. - Thank you, Contessina.
Signor principe, our house thanks you for your demand.
our mild doubts had nothing to do with you.
I tossed and turned in my bed all night long.
if Alexandru pays Sinan Pasha a greater sum, it's your head the sultan will cut off, dear nephew!
look at him, pig! Woe to us!
Sinan Pasha agreed to take your money. He wants to see you.
you should barely speak. He's wreckless and moody.
you miserable sod!
is this him?
young man, where do you think you are? At the Court of Rome?
before the mighty sultan, you bow to the ground and kiss his slipper.
let me see you!
right... That's it. Rise!
you made a good first impression. I heard good things about you.
you walk in fear of God, you are rich...
I heard very bad things about your rival Alexandru.
we learned some proof about his betrayal to the great sultan.
but... you may not be to his liking, either.
your Highness, we did everything to please the almighty sultan.
did anyone ask you anything? Let's go!
we don't know what the thoughts of this man are, while Alexandru has always submitted to us.
there's Alexandru!
dear Christ... Help us, Virgin Mary!
only Allah can help you here.
have mercy on me, almighty!
have mercy, great sultan!
the hearing's over.
wait! Stay a little longer!
leave us alone!
come with me!
I like you. Here, all you see is crawling backs, even those who have the hoofs of their horses full of Europe's dust.
but I could've not liked you.
how could you dare?
we only have one life, almighty sultan!
right... Too bad!
master! Have mercy on me! Almighty sultan!
Murad! You'll be sorry!
you'll be sorry to have chosen him!
Mihal bey, what do you think is Allah's most precious gift to man?
life. - You couldn't have said otherwise.
you're too insignificant.
you'll be reigning over a small land.
one day, your lords will bribe my men, as you did, and I will give the order.
man's greatest gift is power, Mihal.
the most precious one and the most tiresome.
listen! - I'm listening, almighty one.
when you leave, you'll be a poor prince of some small country.
your neighbours will humiliate you, you'll fear us... Stay here!
when young, Sinan was a Christian, too.
I'll give you an army and then you'll know what power is.
what do you say?
I'm not an army man and I don't want to disappoint you.
I care too much for my head. - Too bad!
Allah will sometimes put petty souls into strong bodies.
Why?
what was Alexandru shouting? - That you'll be sorry you chose me.
you don't care too much for your head.
indeed, I may be sorry one day that I chose you.
why don't you get in, Your Highness? Everybody wants to meet you.
I came here to thank you. I must leave.
I'm sorry. - Why did you help me?
you're not like the people that usually ask us for money.
I was impressed to see that you didn't know how to beg.
do you know where my country is? - Now I do. East of Transylvania.
I'll be travelling there soon, at Alba Lulia.
a friend of mine, Christina von Habsburg, is getting married to Prince Sigismund.
I'll be close to your country and, normally, I want to know what happens to my money.
I'm talking nonsense. I'd very much like to know your country.
bucharest - December 1594
we've been robbed! - Give us our money!
they locked the gates!
they robbed us! They must pay their debt!
why are you laughing?
I barely saw my father. We've been hiding, he was on the road...
I don't even know if I can recognize him, dressed like a prince.
he got to the throne with our money!
pay your debts!
give us our money! You robbed us, you thieves!
give us our money, you thieves!
let him come outside and pay his debt!
be courageous!
I'm glad I find you in good health, Your Highness.
what kind of a ruler is he? He never pays his debts!
he's hiding! - Michael, what's going on?
nothing.
who are these men? Why are they shouting?
you're imagining things, Stanca.
Nicolae! - Preda!
I'm so glad to see you! - Nicolae!
welcome! Come with me!
Preda...
present our son to the Lords' Council!
wait! You don't need these trinkles.
don't you have anything to say to me?
I missed you, Stanca. I waited for your arrival.
thank you, especially because it's not true.
you put your life at risk for this throne, Michael.
was it worth...
milady, your rooms are ready.
Radu! - Enough! Silence! Stop whining!
I want to know if you give me the money or not.
we've already done it once. We're wondering...
what, Filimon? Do you or don't you have money for the Turks?
what about the gold coins I gave you?
you're buying weapons, but never pay the tribute.
who spoke?
I am too dumb to speak, but, if we can, we'll pray...
pray in church, milord, for forgiveness!
the Turks don't forget about their tribute.
we're a cursed country, Your Highness. We're poor.
what did you decide? - We're with you, Your Highness.
stand straight, Nicolae!
what do you say?
Buzesti! Selim bey is free to enter wherever he wants.
he should see how faithful we are to the great sultan.
faithful? You haven't paid the legal tribute for six months.
the soldiers who guard your throne didn't receive their pay.
Sinan Pasha is upset. This is why I'm here.
the country is poor, Selim bey.
didn't you know it when you asked to be prince?
Stroe!
Selim Pasha...
even though some lords don't want to pay anything, all the debts of my country will be paid today.
we have gathered the money in the house of the brothers Buzesti.
I want to please everybody. Announce the crowd!
you came a long way, Selim. - A very long way, Mihal.
is it ready?
Yes. Do come in! We'll pay for everything!
thank you.
he lives in fear of the Turks. - You said it!
if it weren't for them...
I was ordered to speak to you like this and this is what I did.
you can kill me, Mihal, but I don't know why you wanted to rule here.
I know what you're worth. Earlier, I was talking to the prince, not to my friend.
I know, Selim. I thank you for this.
Stroe!
to the charriots!
Mihal!
I liked it! Now I recognize you!
like in the old days!
jump, Selim!
selim, take your horse, go to Sinan and tell him what you saw!
you are free. You talked to me in two different ways. I answered the same.
what is it, Radu?
it's the house we were born in, Your Highness. But we are glad.
don't worry! It was old, anyway.
long live the prince!
forgive me, son, for not trusting you.
I'm sorry. - What did you think, mother?
is this what you think of me? That I can sell my country?
and you? What did you think? That I, Voivode Michael, would drink this cup of shame to the last drop?
from this day on, I free myself in front of God and you of any debt and submission!
and I will free all those who are with me!
we have our life and our honour!
wake up! We've been sleeping too long!
the existence of a wall between us and the Ottoman Empire is mandatory.
the territory of the 3 principalities must come to our attention.
as we appreciate the determination and noble courage of Sigismund Bathory, prince of Transylvania, who cast away the Ottoman rule and became our precious vassal, we chose our nephew, archduchess Maria Christina de Gratz, to be the valliant prince's wife.
calm down, Sigismund!
this marriage is to show the world we want to make the prince...
my dear cousin, if my adhesion to the Christian cause forces me to suffer the martyrdom of this marriage...
general Basta will ensure with our troops Transylvania's independence.
your Majesty...
gentlemen...
I'm happy.
I've always dreamt of becoming a humble protector of the cross, of giving my life in revenge of the sacred wounds of our Saviour.
this day...
dear Boris, the fate of our coalition is sealed.
the fate of the two neighbouring countries is of great concern to me.
here are the messengers of prince Aron of Moldavia, who announced that they accepted to be vassals of Transylvania.
you'll make friends with the devil, to meet your goal.
I will properly settle things with Wallachia.
this young man walks on my nerves.
prince Sigismund, don't forget Wallachia is under Turkish rule.
does Your Majesty think Murad would invade Wallachia?
in his place, wouldn't we do the same?
what do you know about the new prince...
...Michael Patrascu?
he's a most unreliable character, Your Majesty.
with money and shrewdness, he bought the throne from Sinan, whom he seems to be friends with.
he has recently paid his creditors by setting them on fire, like boars.
what can we think of a man who meets his commitments in such a manner?
he's an adventurer.
he wants to gather money and leave for a quiet corner of Europe.
your Eminency, we are glad you are so well informed.
what other details do you know, General Basta?
your Majesty, as a tactician, I'm interested in two things:
our enemy and our ally.
I understand prince Sigismund wants Wallachia to be our battle ground.
we must protect the dwellings of the civilized world, Your Majesty.
Wallachia is a country only by name. It has no master.

get up, Preda! There's more 'till Istanbul.
down with your weapons!
Rusciuk
on your knees!
Preda! - I'm here, milord!
Preda, do you remember your Latin? - Yes. I learned it in Padua.
let me hear you!
good... Tonight you will prepare for a long journey.
milord... Now, when... - Preda Buzescu!
tonight you're leaving for Rome.
your deeds are worthy of your Roman ancestors.
tell the valliant prince Michael that he is not facing alone this pagan Goliath.
can we then count on the help of the Holy Roman Church?
the Romans were famed for their practicality.
I'm glad to see this virtue has not wasted away.
tell prince Michael that the Holy Roman Church will support his actions not only through its warm prayers, but with all its financial might.
how can I interpret these precious words, Holy Father?
I see why you're saying this.
the army of Rudolph of Austria will join you at the soonest.
in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, amen.
as for us, my son... Big words, but petty interests!
I can assure the Holy Father that I'm in great difficulty.
I could bearly soothe the pure passion of prince Sigismund.
but General Basta's ambitions... - Plots and childish pride!
you've been everywhere, but you never said a word about this Wallachian prince.
your Holiness, all our reports saw him as faithful to the Turks.
he seemed unreliable.
this unreliable man makes his way to Istanbul by sword, Your Eminence.
you will go His Majesty king Rudolph and you will see that Basta's army leaves right now to the help of prince Michael.
Benedico te.

what is this?
Selim Pasha's coming. - Selim Pasha? How dare he?
how can you have the courage to come to my face?
you bastard! You had the nerve to tell me you knew him.
didn't you ever suspect anything? - No.
then, you're a fool.
what do you think he'll do? - He's cunning and swift.
he'll fight us until the end. If he gets help...
he will conquer Istanbul, before I get the chance to be there.
and I wander through these sands... It's only your fault!
who sent you here?
the almighty sultan is waiting for you in Istanbul, the soonest.
what about you?
the great sultan made me head of the armies that fight in Persia.
charge!
go get them, brothers!
my God, Father... So much water!
it's salty!
Prague, 1595
it was just the right moment. Sinan was busy fighting in Persia.
the Wallachians' attack took the Turks by surprise.
general, you explain everything in such a crude manner! Funny...
didn't you invite this prince to the Council's round table?
I, for one, cannot trust him.
his victories are the result of hazard.
your Eminency, what do you think? - The Lord works in mysterious ways.
indeed. This unreliable man who used to pay tribute to the Turks has amazed the entire Europe. We must help him.
allow me to take leave, Your Majesty.
a brilliant tactician with the pride of a child!
the mere idea of another's success makes him hate him, even if he doesn't know him.
what is the Holy Father's advice to me?
your Majesty, this time I bring you the gold promised to the Holy League, to gather an army against the pagans.
you should've told me this great news at the beginning of our hearing.
I must confess this is a most pleasant surprise.
I'm happy I can be of some use to you, Your Majesty.
still, I'm worried. - I'm listening, Your Eminency.
do you think we can trust this stranger with the gold that the Holy Roman Church wishes to donate to the Crusade?
I was thinking that prince Sigismund was the most...
don't get me wrong! I won't have it.
I'm not that mad as to give the much awaited money to the first comer.
we will organize an army. You will go meet prince Michael.
you will crawl inside his soul, a primitive one, I suppose, and you will give us details and then we will decide.
I'm anxious to see prince Michael among so many heroes!
I have the feeling I see scenes from the Iliad.
your Highness... Our Holy Father sends you this cross, as a sign of that which you are fighting for.
when will the army arrive?
preparations are almost ready.
the Holy Father and Emperor Rudolph decided to give you all the support you asked for.
the great General Basta will join swords with your invincible army.
when?
in five months. - Five months?
you're too great a tactician, not to see that such an attack takes time.
look over there, Your Eminency!
and there. Do you know what these warriors expect? To raise my arm and tell them that 10, 000 mighty soldiers came to their help.
then, they would howl for joy and bring down the walls of Istanbul!
with or without Basta, I would have been there in a week.
Preda! - Yes, milord!
call the men! We're going home.
how, milord?
if I hear another word, I'll cut your head off!
your Eminency, maybe I was wrong to ask for help in Rome.
you're the cousin of prince Sigismund.
do you think he would agree to help me keep the Turks to the Danube, until the Christian army gathers up?
you were right to think about your Transylvanian brother.
you'd better ask him personally. I will bless the friendship between two princes reigning over two neighbouring countries.
then, we'll leave together.
the noble count Gaspar Cornis, great champion of the Hussars, is honoured to fight against the prince of Transylvania,
Sigismund of Bathory!
I dedicate my battle to the noble lady, the archduchess Maria Christina of Austria, and I will fight to prove it.
I hope that, after our wedding, the prince will find a better way to waste his energy.
do you love him? - He's nice, but he's childish.
you talk to your prince! He's awful. Do you think he can speak?
anyway, he knew.
your Highness, today it's sunny, the colours are shining...
won't you smile?
you're right. I was deep in my thoughts.
forgive me! I didn't want to upset you.
I don't have this right, Rosana. I owe you money.
had we been to Bucharest, would you have set me on fire?
what kind of a man is Sigismund? - He's the way you see him.
had I taken him out with a pole, he wouldn't have stood up.
Applaud!
michael of Wallachia!
I'd like us to start our friendship with a chivalrous contest!
don't say yes! For Christ's sake!
my dear friend, we are not here to fight and have fun.
your Highness, fighting with the lance is a knight's pride.
I thank you for making me this honour, Sigismund.
don't, Michael!
prince Sigismund of Bathory, never beaten!
he will face prince Michael of Wallachia!
dear God, help him! - Who's he?
voivode Michael, the one who beats the Turks.
you can't compete without a helmet! It's against the rules!
let's hope God will teach him a lesson. It'd be best for everyone.
you can't do it! It's against the rules!
go on!
he asked for it.
Rosana Di Ventini, you never told me anything!
are you all right? Anything broken?
no. I'm fine.
you're crazy. Don't you know he did it for you?
my God! You shook him hard! - He bit the dust! He asked for it.
your Highness, no matter how much my pride has to suffer,
I'm honoured to shake your hand.
you deserved this victory. - It was an accident.
No! Please! You proved to be a fine handler of the lance.
milord... We don't have time to fight between us, but with the Turks.
and another thing: They are excellent lancers.
a very subtle politician... Brave as Achilles and shrewd as Ulysses!
I get it, although my cousin the cardinal says I miss subtleties.
you know what? Let's have our talk right here!
it's nice here. It smells like horses.
and strong men. I feel I'm your friend now. Let me speak as such!
I studied your proposals and I agree to them.
may God be with us! Sigismund, I'll tell you something you don't know.
the Turks can be defeated.
my dear friend... Always the same! Right to the point.
I want to ask you... Can you beat them all by yourself?
no. That's why I'm here.
I wouldn't want to offend you.
but, for those who can help you, what are you?
I'm myself. - No, my dear friend.
I'll tell you once again, even if we had to fight again.
you're nothing. Most of the people never heard of your country.
I know you could kill me for these words.
what are your relations to the European courts?
to count on Rudolph's help, I, Sigismund of Bathory, have to marry his niece! Compared to her, Lucrezia Borgia's a saint!
how many men do you have? - All the men in the country.
please... Let's forget about these big words!
I know you're in pain. You're proud.
have you ever received any help, except for the cross that my cousin asked me to send you?
so, it was from you.
we were all wondering who this Michael was and how he was like.
was he a man or was he half bear?
the king of Spain doesn't know his own empire, and you want him to know you?
face the reality! Your actions must be supported by a name that is a guarantee for all European kings!
that is, your name, Sigismund. - Right.
to the entire Christian world, the house of Bathory and that of Habsburg are your only guarantee.
but, if your pride goes before the interest of your country...
think it over!
together with the entire transalpine Wallachia, with all its virtues, and under the merciful and deep protection of the most praised prince of Transylvania, Sigismund Bathory, we, voivode ruling over this country, receive his gracious protection.
our common purpose is to fight against the wretched Crescent.
may God help us!
Amen.
here signs, God willing, the prince of the Sacred Roman Empire, of Transylvania, Moldavia and transalpine Wallachia, count of the Szekely people and ruler of part of Hungaria,
Sigismund Bathory.
here signs our representative Michael Patrascu, our beloved faithful ally.
what was worse is over. Now you can count on our full support.
gentlemen... Let's celebrate!
with all these ceremonies, I didn't get the chance to congratulate you for your many victories. If I ever get the chance,
I will be happy to give you the command of my cavalry.
go to hell!
I wouldn't have believed it possible...
all my hopes were with His Highness Michael...
I was hoping he'd remember us Romanians here, for we are under fierce oppression, milords...
shut up, man!
I was afraid you'd left.
you're so sad, Michael.
may God have mercy on him, if he doesn't keep his word!
I will be the end of him. He'll curse the hour he met me.
what about you, Rosana?
I've been waiting so much to see you!
I imagined our meeting in a hundred ways.
I must tell you...
will we ever see each other again?
if you stay here, yes.
I want to speak to Selim Pasha!
what's the name of the river in front of us?
romanians call it Neajlov.
how many men and cannons do they have?
about 16, 000 men and 20 cannons.
tell me, Selim Pasha... Did you think I'd fight the Wallachian, while you played the hero in Persia?
Yes, Sinan Pasha. That's what I thought.
do you remember you brought him to the Court, to take over his throne?
it's been a long time, but I remember.
tomorrow you will wash away this shame.
Allah be with us!
what's this noise?
mosquitos. We're in swamp land, Your Grace.
milord...
I want to ask you something.
do you want me to make you a metropolitan?
no. I want to stay with the army.
I don't want you to regret one day that we joined our fate, father.
the Lord is stronger and wiser. - Maybe, but this is what I want.
father, guess who's here!
stanca... You, here?
I brought you another 300 horsemen from Oltenia. I knew you'd need them.
you're so brave, Stanca! As always.
Nicolae, my son, go to sleep! We have a hard day tomorrow.
you look worried. - No... I'm just sad.
they let me down again.
I humiliated myself in front of that liar Sigismund!
I thought he was a Christian, just like me.
I thought we'd need one another in front of our enemy.
I was wrong. We have an old saying:
"better an enemy, than a friend who's a liar."
where did you find 300 horsemen?
I gathered them how I could, then I bought weapons and horses.
Michael...
I want to ask you something.
can I do anything for you? Yes. It's very important.
I know that... - Nicolae.
Yes, Nicolae. Let me take him away!
only God knows how tomorrow will end.
he's our child. Your heir.
go, Stanca! Do what you want! Maybe it's my fate to be left alone.
the Transylvanians are here.
count Kiraly!
your Highness...
do you think it was wise to choose such an uncomfortable place?
how many men did you bring, Your Excellency?
500 Szekely men.
my prince and your ruler is disappointed that he couldn't bring his army.
but he is now in Alba Lulia, where he is celebrating his wedding with the duchess Maria Christina of Austria.
500 men? Is this the promised help?
your Highness, my experience as a warrior is greater than you think.
I'm fed up with talks and promises!
father Stoica, show the count where he can place his men!
milord, I'm knight Tompa. You can cut my head off, but it's not my fault.
it's that one... May the Devil take him!
we, the Szekely men, we'll fight with your 'till death.
we know you. We heard a lot about your reign.
all right, Tompa. Thank you.
tomorrow, my sweet wife, you will see a most wonderful tournament.
I hope you'll have enough energy left, to be a winner.
I'm impressed by your cold attitude in front of all these beauties.
you have the most troubling beauty I've ever seen.
I'd give my principality, in exchange for your good will.
your Highness, in politics, deceit may be a virtue.
in love, though, it's the emblem of the weak.
as beautiful as rich and merciless!
in fact, I'd forgotten your heart belonged to our valliant Wallachian.
our vassal...
poor Kiraly! Who knows where he is now?
I don't see why we sent him there. With or without him, the Wallachians will lose the battle.
and, if he wins, who'll rise up to his pride?
win? How do you think that the Wallachian could crush Sinan?
don't get excited, gentlemen! No matter what the outcome, we are still the true winners.
we? - Your Eminency, we planned it all.
have you forgotten that the Wallachian is my vassal?
his victory will make the entire Europe know the bravery of my troops.
if he wins, Sinan will pay dearly.
his weakend army will have less chances in a battle with us.
indeed! He'd even have to build garrisons in the conquered towns.
Sheikban Pasha!
you'll take the command of the centre.
you'll charge the bridge with the Janissaries of the first line.
it must look like the ultimate attack.
I'll send the second line in your support.
you'll go on attacking him 1, 000 steps beyond the bridge, then you'll fall back, as if defeated.
you must lure the Wallachian to this other side of the bridge.
mustafa Pasha!
you'll leave the Wallachian 1, 000 steps from this side of the bridge.
then, you'll charge along the river with your right wing.
Rumelia's armies led by Hassan Pasha will do the same thing on the left.
then, we'll catch him in a clasp.
you may go.
if the Wallachian crosses the bridge, he will fall in our trap.
Satargi Pasha, you stay as reserve, behind the hill.
and you, Selim Pasha, will stay with me.
anything against it?
no, Your Grace.
I haven't seen so many Turks in all my life.
they're like the leaves of grass.
if the Turks cross the bridge, you strike on the side, to the right.
I'll attack them on the left.
father, you help the pedestrians! Don't go back a single step!
it is time. May God help us!
the second line and 20 cannons will enter the battle.
for the bridge, at my command! Charge!
follow me, brave men!
charge!
give the signal!
stop!
don't cross the bridge! It's a trap!
don't cross the bridge! Stop!
do not cross the bridge!
the Wallachian is not stupid. Let all Pashas gather for council!
the Wallachian stopped at the bridge, but he moved all his troops.
he doesn't have any hidden armies.
mustafa, you will make a wide detour with the Anatolian armies.
then you will cross the Neajlov and, from the other side, you'll strike the Wallachian army on the side.
we'll do the same on the left side, with Rumelia's armies, led by Hassan Pasha.
the bridge will be under attack by the Janissaries and Spahis.
get going!
the first round was a child's trap, plotted by Sinan.
the true battle begins now.
you'll fight too now, brothers! I call the Stone troops!
let's go!
the Wallachian engaged all his forces in battle.
now's the time for Hassan and Mustafa to attack.
you'll enter the battle and not give in one step.
Where's Hassan? Where's Mustafa? I'll cut their heads off!
Mustafa! Charge!
fall back! You'll go back in order!
in order!
we lost. Let's fall back!
what? We came and saw everything, and now you want us to flea?
I won't do this. - It's an order.
I won't listen to such orders. Come with me!
your Spahi seized their cannons.
Where's that stupid Hassan?
this wretched swamp! We're lost.
let's go round it!
what would you do, if you were me?
do you think I'm too old to fight?
you're the one who's helpless, you with your damaged hand!
it's our turn.
listen carefully!
we can still beat them.
brothers Buzesti... And you! You will attack on the centre.
I'll come on the shore, towards the bridge.
and you, Cocea...
there's a hard time ahead of you.
all I ask of you is follow me! Don't you forget!
it's better to have an enemy in the ground, than in our country!
follow me!
what?
your Grace... The Wallachian leads new troops.
they attacked us from one side at the bridge.
shut up, you fool!
it's his last breath! Fight on!
fire!
he had less than 300 horsemen. Charge!
what is this? - They went to our camp.
we're lost! - Call the retreat!
don't run away! Wait!
the Turks are running away! Don't give it up!
fight, you brothers!
follow me!
charge!
Sinan Pasha!
Sinan Pasha!
Sinan!
victory!
victory!
help me, Selim!
can I do it, with this damaged hand?
or should I save the sultan's flag?
I promise you anything, if you save me!
don't stand there! Help me!
victory!
victory!
your Highness, I gathered the wounded.
all is ready. There's a wounded Turk who wants to speak to you.
Hassan?
my name's Ionica, milord. It will be until I die.
let me be your faithful servant!
take care of his foot and treat him with honour!
from now on, I want to see him at my side. Let's go!
so many dead, milord... Too many!
I know.
the Romanians will never forget this battle.
nor will our enemies.
a few things that you might need to know.
el, I need to talk to you about Dad's computer.
Yeah, I thought that I uncovered some secret files.
turned out just to be cheats on some video game that he was developing.
my sister just lied to me.
she's never lied to me.
there was only one man my father was ever afraid of.
he went by the name Agent X.
I'm going to track him down and kill him.
then no one can touch me, ever.
Freeze!
take it easy, Tiger, I'm-I'm here to help.
DS&T picked up some chatter of a possible break-in attempt.
not likely.
it's always a ghost town down here.
Oh, damn it.
I'm sorry, I haven't had my morning coffee yet.
let me, um... help.
who says chivalry is dead?
good work.
I knew there was a reason I brought you, outside of the obvious, of course.
that's the computer with all the Agent X files?
no, it's a tracker.
somebody must be using the computer.
but it looks as if the CIA is keeping tabs.
locate this signal, and we'll have exactly what Miss Volkoff wants.
this was too easy.
have to imagine the CIA is being way more careful with the actual computer.
Oh, shoot. Ellie, come on.
Hey, babe, doing a little last-minute prep for Chuck's bachelor party.
can you give me a little sunscreen pre-coat?
sure...
uh, make sure you lube up the lats.
gonna be sunny in Vegas.
what's with the old house?
that? I figured out a cyclomatic complexity that ran through all the conditionals in my dad's research
that's the end of the loop.
awesome. - All paths seem to end at that photo.
I don't understand - why would my dad want me to have this picture of an old house?
what are you doing, El?
aren't you supposed to be getting ready for Sarah's bachelorette party?
honey, don't worry. Clara's already at your parents' house,
I am all packed for our girls' day trip;
I promise I will turn it off as soon as the festivities begin.
okay? - Fair enough.
gonna finish packing for the dude trip.
Vegas, baby. Vegas...!
may I ask the best man what casino we're going to be hitting first?
I got a fat stack burning a hole in my crotch.
I- I don't think that's, uh... - Oh, no; it's burning.
uh, no-no idea, actually. I put Awesome in charge of everything.
apparently, he's the Vegas expert.
nice. - Yeah.
what about you, Casey? Any casino preferences?
no. Forget the casinos.
best thing about Vegas are the gun ranges.
brought some of my fancy targets.
well, I got some bad news.
see you guys on Monday.
hang on, Big Michael.
you're not coming?
Bologna Grimes says I couldn't go.
she knows I tapped Vegas dry back when I was with Earth, Wind, Fire, and Rain.
you want me to call this Baloney lady, give her the what for?
Nah. Once Bologna has made a decision, there's no going back on it.
you guys enjoy.
No! No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no.
hold on a second. Hold on a second.
y - You are my future stepfather.
this will not stand. Now, come on...
we're men! Men who take what's theirs!
you have to march into that house, slam your fist on the counter, and then you look at my mother in the eye, and you say, "Bologna, I am so sorry, woman...
... but I have to work at the Buy More all weekend. " You see, this way, when she asks me, I'll say, "Yeah, we got all this new inventory. We have to work around the clock.
boom! Boom.
that's the greatest thing... a white person's ever done for me.
let's go to Vegas!
Vegas, Vegas. What does a bachelor wear in Vegas?
I can't believe you've never been to Vegas.
and, by the way, a bachelor does not wear that.
what?
you're not digging the whole business up-top, party below-the-waist thing?
I figured it covered all the Vegas activities with one fell swoop.
speaking of "looks," you're sure doing an awful lot of maintenance over there.
Oh, I'm just reminding you of what you'll be missing out on in Vegas.
Oh, trust me, I'll remember.
Where's Ellie taking you guys anyway?
I'm not sure.
every time I do recon, she's on your dad's computer.
she spends a lot of time on that thing.
Yeah, well, Ellie's always been into puzzles; you know, logic puzzles,
sudoku, crosswords - I mean, one of my earliest memories of my sister was when she solved the 12-sided Rubik's Cube before I even got mine out of the box.
have you spoken to Devon yet?
told him that you know that Ellie is still using the computer?
no. Not yet.
I'm planning on having a good man-to-man talk as soon as we get to Vegas.
I mean, it's the perfect place to have a sincere, honest, heartfelt conversation.
you really have never been to Vegas, have you?
Awesome...!
let's go, let's go, let's go!
uh... just a minute, Chuck! Coming!
Hi.
what's up?
I was just, uh, I was reading a book.
you don't have to lie to me, Ellie.
I know you're planning Sarah's bachelorette party
come on, we've all got some secrets. Don't we Awesome?
you don't know the half of it, bro.
let me tell you something.
this weekend... I'm going to make a man out of you.
goody! Can't wait for that
okay, well, you guys have fun.
be safe, and I'm just... I'm going to do stuff.
okay. - Okay.
Bye. - Bye.
we finally have a lock on the Orion computer signal.
echo Park, Los Angeles.
perfect. Let's move.
all right, boys.
I want you to get ready.
even if you've been to the City of Sin before, you've never been with me.
awesome, thank you so much for planning this trip.
dude, you kidding? I live for this.
okay, we need to think of this weekend like a war.
now you're talking my language.
when we get there, we immediately take over The Strip.
high rollin' on The Strip!
what the... Ow! Ow!
what are you doing?!
I'm making it rain- Canadian style- which is, technically, making it snow.
save the Socialist funny money.
and save your energy. Vegas is the land of excess.
for those of you who like to chase tail, there is plenty of that, too.
rest up, boys... 'cause we might not sleep again for a long time.
bachelorette weekend. I Cheers.
so, are you going to let me in on the big secret?
what have you got planned for tomorrow?
okay, we are going to a spa in Santa Barbara, and we're not just doing massages we're doing body scrubs, too.
wow, uh... That sounds very... relaxing.
get ready for some hardcore aromatherapy.
all right, boys! Let's tear this town a new one!
Yeah! - Woo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
welcome to Las Vegas, boys!
captain, what's, uh, what's-what's going on? This is not Las Vegas.
Las Vegas, buddy. Look!
so this whole time you've been saying "Las Ve-cas"?
of course! What else would I be saying?
Las Vegas.
hold on a second, I heard you say we're going to the City of Sin.
this is the City of Cinn...
among Falls. After the famous waterfall.
the locals call it the "City of Cinn.
what about taking over The Strip?
Yeah, the old mining strip. It's next to the campsite.
I thought we were going to chase tail.
there's a huge yellow-bellied marmot population.
they love being chased.
long as I can set up a gun range.
Yeah, nature's gun range - the great outdoors.
Hey. You okay, buddy?
I know that you were looking forward to partying in Vegas most of all.
what? I knew we were going to Vegas!
Oh. This place is amazing!
they grow some magic fungus up in them their hills.
I'm going to go find some; maybe chase a little tail.
that's the spirit, big guy!
Yeah! Let's get unpacked.
well, I better go unpack and rest up for the big day.
rest up? This is your bachelorette party.
we have to get you tired before you can rest.
tired? - Come on...
surprise!
Yeah!
come on, you didn't think I was just going to take you to some lame spa, right?
I tried to call the girls from the CAT squad, but they were away in Libya somewhere, so I invited a few of the Wienerlicious girls and some friends from the hospital.
thank you. This is a very nice surprise.
I know it's not going to be like as crazy as Vegas, but, uh, we'll have a few drinks, see where the night takes us.
okay. Okay.
all right, boys.
get ready for the bachelor party hike.
I figure we can forage for our supper out there.
I do not forage.
okay, look, guys, I know this isn't exactly Las Vegas, but Awesome worked really hard putting this all together, you know?
got to admire the man for sticking to his strategy.
sure, and you know what?
a hike actually sounds pretty invigorating right now.
I've never hiked in a tie.
I know, right?
Yeah. Get the blood pumping.
I mean, it could be just as fun as Vegas.
cause this weekend is-is... it's about bonding after all, isn't it?
no. No, it isn't. - Not at all.
Amen.
Michael, may I have a word with you over there by that crappy tree?
listen. I have a plan.
don't bother telling me - I'm in.
all right.
you were the best, wiener girl.
Hey, Chuck, listen, the secure CIA location has been compromised, and we need to bring in the Orion computer immediately.
can you please call me back and tell me where your sister keeps it, okay?
call me.
okay, game time!
let's give our bride-to-be a toilet paper dress!
Oh, listen, Ellie, can we please talk? I want...
Ellie, wait. We need to talk.
okay, Ellie, no, this... Listen, this can't wait. Okay, my...
my employer knows about... about your father's computer, and...
and I have to take it to a secure location right now!
Why? Why? What happened?
the signal is coming from a mile up the road.
okay, there's nothing to be alarmed about.
it's just, the CIA had a breach of security, and your dad's computer could be involved.
Oh, I should have known something like this would happen. I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I... I was accessing a lot of weird stuff on that computer.
something about an Agent X and an Intersect program.
I hid it in here.
this isn't my bag. This is Devon's bag.
he must have taken it by mistake.
you know, it's okay. There is nothing to worry about.
nobody is in any danger.
okay.
lock and load!
Oh, okay, uh, I mean, do you mind if I make a phone call?
Oh. Okay.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to look at... I'm sorry.
okay, General, I need you to put me in touch with our agents in Las Vegas, please.
Ooh, um, is that a gun? No.
this way.
that's a... That's a pretty fantastic hike. Thanks.
Yeah, absolutely.
I'm glad those other dudes found some stuff to do.
Vegas has got a lot for everyone.
right in the ribs.
listen, since it's, uh, just the two of us, you mind if we talk, man-to-man?
sure.
I know that you didn't take the hard drive out of my dad's computer.
I'm sorry, Chuck.
it just made Ellie so happy. I couldn't do it to her.
I get it. I-I get that. And I'm happy that she's happy.
and I'm happy that she's continuing my father's work.
it's just that these secrets - they're...
I feel like they're tearing my family apart.
down, down.
kill that light.
Devon, why would you bring that to my bachelor party?
Oh, no. I must have grabbed Ellie's bag.
this is the device Miss Volkoff wants.
it has all the Agent X files.
Casey, we cannot let her access the information on that computer.
sweep the woods. Leave no witnesses.
Jeff Hey!
you guys here for the bachelor party?
awesome brought entertainment.
do you like this?
cause I got three more where that came from.
laptop
who's this Vivian Volkoff?
it's a long story. Actually, it's pretty easy.
I mean, it's Chuck's nemesis.
he put her old man behind bars, she sent an assassin to blow up Castle.
what about Agent X?
I think I might be Agent X.
Chuck, I am so sorry that I let Ellie touch your dad's computer.
Chuck, I'm so sorry I let this guy plan your bachelor party.
this is so awful.
Oh, yeah.
let's get this party started!
my sentiments exactly.
the CIA cracked the encryption.
I'll upload the files to Miss Volkoff.
Yeah, but first, find out how much he knows.
if he doesn't talk, see that he never talks again.
welcome back.
you know why I'm here, don't you?
is it because I've been a bad boy?
what's in the shooter?
sodium pentathlon - truth serum.
freaky. I don't think that'll mix with what I'm on.
guys- Jeff- they're torturing him.
Lester and Big Mike can wander in at any second.
we got to do something. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Casey, what's the plan?
who was that?
mercenaries. Ex-Green Berets, judging by their tactics.
I count three, including the leader in camp.
guys, did you see that clean break?
maybe I can save him.
no, he's dead, and so are we, unless you three tighten up.
what's this?
you and Morgan are gonna find some good strong sticks and start sharpening.
Yes, sir. Perfect.
sharpening what?
toothpicks.
spears, you idiot.
I'll draw the rest of the team out into the woods.
I'm sorry. You want us to fight former Green Berets with spears?
not you. You're gonna go down to the camp and spring Jeff.
happy hunting, boys.
happy hunting?
looking. Looking. Looking.
I'm showing the nearest casinos in Las Vegas, Nevada.
did you say Las Vecas?
I did not. - Well, no. We have to stay local.
there's got to be a nightclub or a bar or... a liquor store or...?
Vegas! Vegas, Vegas, Vegas.
are you saying Vecas...? - Don't play with me, boy.
we are getting the hell out of here.
this is not what I signed up for.
wait.
No! We can't just leave them. They may die out there.
take the drama down a notch.
I only care about Jeff.
what? What is it?
a splinter, I think.
let me take a look.
Oh, please. Listen to me. There are men trying to kill us.
I can handle a little splinter, all right? I mean...
Ooh, it... it hurts!
Morgan, you ever kill a man?
I'll tell you something.
the first one... the first one's the hardest.
there's no doubt about it.
Really? - No, not really.
they don't even give me a gun on missions.
are you kidding me?
I'm a doctor. I took an oath to preserve lives.
what about your own life? Dude, you heard Casey. It's them, or it's us.
what if we met these guys at a bar?
you know, we could be frat brothers, for all I know.
frat brothers - these are mercenaries, dude. Drinks? Beers?
you hear something?
no. You're having first "mish" jitters.
it's not my first "mish. - " I think it's your first "mish.
how are those spears coming?
you are lucky we didn't kill you with these spears! They are really sharp.
you ought to. They're dead.
dead? Well, what are these for?
they kept you out of my way.
men, what's your status?
Oh, poor baby. you're fresh out of friends.
looks like Well, in that case, I'm just gonna have to come out there and kill you myself.
the captive's unconscious.
kill him.
I see you've had knife training.
let me give you one final lesson.
it's over.
it's over.
sorry to interrupt your little lap dance.
if anyone's still alive, meet me at the extraction point.
what the hell's going on?
Jeff's having a bad trip.
we've got to get out of Vegas now.
good thing you boys came to your senses.
best bachelor party ever.
Vecas, baby! Yeah.
Hey, where have you been?
Yeah, wrong Vegas.
so where is Orion's laptop? Beckman thought that
she was right - Vivian Volkoff sent a team for it.
they tried to kill us.
I've got to tell Ellie what she got herself into.
if I didn't grab the wrong bag, you girls would have been ambushed.
I agree - Ellie deserves to know.
I'll tell her.
I feel responsible that the CIA used her to find Agent X.
no, I'll tell her.
but then you'll have to tell her the truth about you.
I know.
what are you doing home?
uh, I had to cut the bachelor party short.
there-there's something that's been on my mind.
what is it?
we've always been able to tell each other anything, right?
lately I felt like...
like there's something in the way.
Yes, exactly, our family is so full of secrets.
too many secrets.
I mean, our parents alone. - Yeah, and, and, and I don't think there should be any secrets between the two of us.
I've been working on something secret.
I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want you to worry and...
I know about Dad's laptop and his research - Mom told me.
so why are we here?
you're still a spy.
wait, w-w-wait, wait, wait a second,
I had a whole speech and you just figured that out.
you can't figure that out by yourself.
I think I just did.
you just Rubik's Cubed me, sis.
of course you still work for the CIA.
Sarah's a spy, you're clearly built for better things than the Buy More.
you're not mad?
I'm not mad that you did it.
I'm mad that you didn't tell me.
I mean, I get it - it's the same reason that I kept Dad's computer a secret from you.
no more secrets, though.
one more little secret.
look at this place.
what are you guys guarding down here that's so important?
el, you know that Intersect project that Dad was working on?
Yeah, I've been trying to figure it out for weeks.
it's in my head.
what?
no... Uh, Morgan, Katana sword, please.
Oh, yes, yes, Katana - all right.
uh, full speed or half speed?
full speed, thank you.
okay, okay.
Banzai...!
sleeveless.
pretty cool, right?
our dad was amazing.
he did it.
he actually figured out a way to program the human brain using...
what happened?
I was going to use this to find Agent X.
Ellie, you found him.
you're looking at the first human Intersect - it's me.
no, not unless he gave it to you before you were born.
november 21, 1980.
what, there was an Intersect before Chuck?
from what I can piece together from his files,
dad used this program to input a new identity into an operative.
so Agent X could go undercover.
but once he went undercover, something went wrong.
dad must have felt responsible for it and that's why he spent his whole life looking for him.
not that that's going to happen now.
Ellie, I haven't spent ten years in the Nerd Herd for nothing.
Morgan, get my tools.
Yes, sir, of course.
what tools?
for fixing computers.
tools for fixing computers, coming up.
well, I might as well get started on this inventory.
somehow my cover story became the truth.
hold on a second.
let me ask you two a question.
who am I?
you're Big Mike.
no, I'm Rain of Earth, Wind, Fire, and Rain
and Rain does not waste a free party pass.
neither does Thunder.
is that name taken?
okay, wait, wait - are we going to go to the real Vegas?
no. - Well, then...
me and the boys had a standing engagement in a city that makes Vegas look like the Vatican.
what is this mythical place?
go get my Corolla.
got it.
okay, here, uh, here are the files.
his whole file's been redacted.
except for a name - Hartley.
he did leave something else.
I have no idea what it means or if it's some sort of clue.
I know where that is.
what, how?
the Intersect - that's incredible.
Yeah.
Ellie, look at that date.
it's a week before Agent X went missing.
do you think maybe he took the photo as a keepsake before his final mission?
this place must be special for him.
maybe it's his home.
or some kind of safe house.
you think Agent X has been hiding out there for 30 years?
what's going on?
we're not the only ones trying to find Agent X.
the people who put that hole in Dad's laptop - they're after him, too.
well, I'm coming with you.
what, are you crazy?
no, two words: Baby Clara.
what about you?
don't worry about it.
it's what I do.
30 years.
looks like somebody's still living there.
if this Agent X guy has been hiding from the CIA all these years, he might not take too well to being found.
Oh, hello.
may I help you?
so sorry to disturb you ma'am, but our car has just broken down, and I was looking in the, in the boot - the bonnet.
uh, long story short, we're stranded.
could we please use your phone?
Oh, of course, come in.
I'll make some tea while you wait for the lorry.
thank you. - That way.
Cheers, lovely.
what's taking her so long?
will you relax, Casey?
you don't think she's Agent X, do you?
I don't know who the hell she is.
that old bird could be poisoning our tea as we speak.
here we are. Nice cup of tea.
now, get it while it's hot.
and this one is for you.
thank you.
delicious, thank you.
so where are you all from?
um, not far from here, actually.
I was just showing my fiancé?
a bit of the countryside before the wedding.
he's American, of course.
and this handsome young man?
he is-is a hitchhiker we picked up on the edge of town.
Yeah, he had such a nice face, we figured, what the hell?
uh, I was just telling my fiancé?
that my father had a friend who lived here, actually.
in this house?
Oh, how interesting.
Yes, I believe his name was Hartley.
any relation to you?
Oh, no, I'm just an old spinster.
but I do know the man you're referring to.
he was the previous tenant.
a bit of a recluse, judging by the way he left the place.
Oh, do you know what happened to him?
no, I'm afraid not.
thank you for the tea.
maybe we should go and wait for the tow truck.
but he did leave behind a box of personal effects.
Oh, I'd forgotten all about it.
I mean, it has been 30 years.
Oh, well, I'd hate to bother you.
no, you're welcome to it
well, if your fiancé would kindly give me a hand?
I believe it's a bit heavy.
I would love to.
wait here while I grab a torch.
delightful.
tell me who you are, and what you want with my son
before you make me go ruin my wallpaper.
please, please, ma'am, I'm-I'm here to help your son.
I'm here to help Hartley.
I'm with the CIA.
so, you're saying you work for the people who took my son?
give me your sidearm.
ma'am, I actually don't carry a gun.
Hartley should never have been sent undercover.
he was a scientist.
when the CIA couldn't bring him in, they disavowed him.
no one lifted a finger!
they did, they did!
my father, he spent his entire career trying to find Hartley.
you're Stephen Bartowski's boy?
you knew my dad?
of course.
he and Hartley were quite close.
are you gonna fix my son?
this is the place.
looks like someone beat us to it.
move out.
not bad. - Great.
we're outgunned and outmanned.
what are you waiting for, laddie?
lay down some fire.
who are these people?
mercenaries. Must have followed us.
they're not after you.
they're after the same thing you came for.
Hartley's spy will.
here.
there's a vault in the cellar.
you'll find the spy will down there.
go!
Oh, put down that damn peashooter.
there's a real gun in the chest.
there.
I prepared for something like this.
you know how to feed one of these things?
please!
where would you put a spy will?
there go my primroses!
eat lead, you bastards!
bingo.
we're out.
now what?
we'll have to scuttle the house.
go! Go! Go!
you're like the mother I never had.
Oh, and charming to boot.
come on, let's go find your team, so we can get out the back door.
what's she doing?
you don't want to know.
ready?
Oh, no.
Oh, you remind me of my son.
he didn't care much for guns, either.
whatever it was in this box,
I hope it's what you're looking for.
only a few more hours till we hit Reno.
Reno?
more like Reen-yes!
Yeah.
it practical.
Oh, man, this is my jam!
this yours?
Reno, here we come!
we're here.
Really?
Jeffrey, this isn't Reno.
um, yeah, it is.
good Lord!
I can't believe this is happening.
you're welcome.
no, no, no, no, no!
I blame you, Michael!
wait. Stop killing. Stop the killing.
what's that over yonder?
boys, we're here.
let's make it snow!
remember, boys, the joker's worth 13.
are we waiting for a code from the CIA to open it or something?
I was just waiting to open it with you.
so the identity of Agent X is inside that box.
our dad's obsession.
the whole reason that our family fell apart.
Wha...? Volkoff?
agent X is Alexei Volkoff?
I know this man.
mom brought him to the house for Thanksgiving.
he's a spy, right?
no, not exactly.
Yeah, but he wasn't.
I mean, that's the thing.
Volkoff was a cover identity.
in reality, he was just a scientist who didn't like using guns.
so Dad's original Intersect created
we should talk to Mom.
maybe she was trying to fix him, too, you know, in her own way.
we need to call Beckman, see what our next step is.
no. We tell no one.
interrogation room. Now.
it ends here.
we're all gonna pretend we never saw this.
John, my dad clearly wanted Chuck and me to figure this out.
there must be a reason.
look, the CIA created one of the most murderous men in the history of the world.
there's powerful people who spent an enormous amount of energy covering that up.
you know what happens if they find out we know?
they order a guy like me to put a bullet in each one of our heads.
so we're supposed to just sweep this thing under the rug?
Ellie, we're talking about the CIA.
there are rules.
what about Dad? What about Dad?
what if his plan was just to get us to search together? You know?
we haven't exactly been the most honest siblings the past couple of years.
no, we haven't.
but this search...
it made us rely on each other.
be honest, work together.
what if that was only half of it?
I - I don't think that we're supposed to stop here, Chuck.
I don't think that we're supposed to just find Agent X.
we're supposed to fix him.
this isn't for the CIA to solve, Chuck.
I think this is for us.
male DISPATCHER: We have India 114, 116, and 260 in position.
flight 104 is 500 yards in trail, waiting for your go.
that's it, right there. There's our guy.
begin your final approach to the target.
pilot ON RADIO: Flight 104, copy that.
ANDY: Shit!
Walter, wake up. Customs.
what? Who?
we need the fucking bag. Where the fuck is the key?
CBP OFFICER: Tighten that line. Now secure the other side.
easy, easy up.
okay, okay.
hurry up. Come on, put it in the bag.
come on!
CBP OFFICER: Pull this up. Come on, come on. Let's go!
WALTER: Go, Andy.
CBP OFFICER: Stop! Federal officer! Don't move!
excuse me. Excuse me, y'all. Can I have everybody's attention?
I want to do a quick toast to the bride and groom, Danny and Shelly.
Congratulations.
I can't believe it, man. I'm fucking married, Chris.
Danny, I know. I was standing right there with you.
look, what about this fucking guy?
he's my best friend, best man at my wedding.
he doesn't even remember that this is where my reception was.
thank God he's sober.
you don't remember?
I remember throwing up on Kate's shoes.
Yeah, I remember, too.
I apologized for that.
everybody, do it like this.
TOMMY: I mean, you were like the Lennon and McCartney of smuggling.
how do you smuggle a fucking Ferrari? Where do you hide it?
CHRIS: We didn't.
we let customs seize it in port.
give me your phone.
SEBASTIAN: You take the guts out.
the transmission, the wiring system.
take all that shit out, hide it inside other containers.
so, when customs auctions off the car, he gets himself a Ferrari for next to nothing.
he just bought the empty shell?
Yes, he got the empty shell at the auction.
and then we...
sell him the missing parts. ...sold him back the guts.
and he's got himself a new Ferrari for less than you paid for that piece-of-shit Honda.
it's a nice Honda.
Yeah, that's why you live in it, right?
because it's a nice fucking Honda.
can I dance with my wife?
Hey, what's up, buddy?
can I get another one of these when you get a chance?
Hey, Chris.
church, hey.
how are you doing, man?
long time, no see. Where you been?
well, I'm living out in Algiers now.
the fuck are you doing out there?
it's nice, I like it out there.
it's good for the family.
a guy like you don't belong in Algiers, Chris.
what are you doing for work?
I started my own business, setting up alarm systems.
fill that up, will you?
your old man getting jailed freak you out? Huh?
I guess.
that, and having a wife and two little boys, you know?
Yeah.
you've got to stick to what you're good at, though, Chris.
listen, I offered to take care of that ship captain for your dad.
he said no.
anyway, Chris, if you're ever thinking of getting back in, let me know, okay?
yeah?
Yeah. Good.
I don't even know why we're doing this in the first place.
just trust me, okay? It will be cool.
if we try to run, it will make it worse.
where are these guys?
here we go, here we go.
be cool, now.
here we go, here we go.
ANDY: Hey, man.
customs boarded us, we had to dump the package.
you did?
we had no choice.
right?
nothing we could do, man.
that's it.
what did I say? I told you it was cool.
WALTER: Come on, man, let's get the fuck out of here.
Hello?
it's my brother.
what happened? Is he okay?
no. We've got to go now.
what?
CHRIS: Walter is in surgery.
what the fuck happened, Andy?
it was an accident.
you know what? You're a shitty liar, so don't even fucking try.
look at me when I'm talking to you.
I was running something.
we got boarded, and I dumped it.
you dumped what?
the coke.
Kate: Oh, fuck.
ANDY: It was over 10 pounds.
for who?
for Tim Briggs and those guys.
they're going to kill me.
Andy, they're not going to kill you.
ANDY: It was a lot of stuff.
I'm sorry.
you should be fucking sorry.
is he all right?
no, the little fuckhead was running something and he dumped it. Now he owes.
who? Who does he owe?
tim Briggs.
ask around, see what you can find out, all right?
how is Kate?
not good.
CHRIS: I can't believe he did that.
when I quit, I told him to stay away from these guys.
please, if you had anything to do with this, just tell me right now.
I just told you.
okay.
he's my little brother.
I know. I'm going to take care of it.
I got you.
Kate: I'll call you in the morning.
JEANIE: Okay, no problem.
good night.
CHRIS: So you said King Security put the system in?
that's right. A lot of good it did.
it's a decent system, but your locks are a joke.
anybody who knows the response time is going to be able to get in and out.
can you excuse me for one second, sir?
Yes.
what's going on? SEBASTIAN: It's about Briggs, Kyle's brother.
Yeah, and?
I don't know, hold on.
guys! Guys! How are we doing today?
is my office still going to be done last week?
you having a nice morning?
good!
Briggs got out of prison two months ago.
he hangs out at the Old Point Bar.
I'll pop over there after I'm done work and see if I can talk to him.
sorry about that, sir.
the cameras are nice and small, they'll fit right up there in the corner.
Oh, shit!
Chris Farraday, back from the dead, man! Yeah!
good to see you, man.
Oh, shit. This man was a world-class smuggler here.
you were fucking Houdini, man.
Yeah, he used to run with my brother, God rest his miserable soul.
too bad your skill didn't rub off on your shithead brother-in-law.
no, I know, he's a fuck-up.
Mmm. But he's my wife's little brother.
I was hoping you understand it's family, maybe we could work something out.
well, I don't know. What do you want to work out?
you want to work out something with me?
I can figure out a way to pay you back the buy money.
no, that's worth 700 grand to me.
Oh, come on, man. No, come on, man.
you're going to try to charge me full freight for a bad run?
customs boards the boat, you dump that shit. You know how it goes.
you know how many passes I gave your brother in his day?
Yeah, I hated my brother.
what do you want to do, a payment plan?
what, do I look like a bank to you?
no, I was just hoping you could be fucking reasonable, here.
Hey! This ain't your world anymore, man!
you're a tourist, you can't trade on status you don't have.
I got bills to pay.
you know, when people fuck that up, that's their fucking problem.
you think that's funny? You got bills?
I like your outfit.
I liked your brother.
man: We're here today, that's the important thing.
so, you know, learning to let go and let God is what's been pulling me through all of this.
you're going to have to talk me down before I fucking kill Briggs.
probably be better off.
I'm one drink away from the worst day of my life.
what should I do?
man: ...sitting in this circle that's had that same thought, right?
that's all you gotta do, is work the steps.
CHRIS: I'm not doing another run.
no fucking way.
I could probably get us the buy money, no problem.
no, I finally got something going.
I'm not going to chance fucking it up.
it's not going away, Chris.
man: Does somebody want to share?
Sebastian? Want to share a little bit with us?
okay. Oh, yeah.
go do your thing.
you don't want to stick around?
no, I get far too emotional hearing that story.
Hey, everyone, I'm Sebastian. ALL: How are you doing, Sebastian?
what the hell happened?
Walter died last night.
do me a favor, and don't tell Kate. Not until I'm gone.
when I stopped doing runs, you promised me you were gonna stay out of this shit.
what do you want me to say, man?
not a fucking word!
I didn't have anybody to tell me I was fucking up. You do!
and you put your sister and the boys in this shit?
what the fuck is wrong with you?
whoa.
you don't come to my fucking place.
I just came to tell you that I'm going to have your money within a month.
just stay away from Andy.
I ain't waiting that long.
well, I ain't paying if he's dead.
if a guy dies owing something,
so I'll give you two weeks.
if not, I'm going to come after the both of you.
then, all the way down the line.
I'll come asking your wife for it, your kids...
do you think you're the only guy with a fucking gun?
you'll get your fucking money.
but if you ever mention my wife and my kids again, you're done.
you hear me? You are fucking done!
girl: Daddy.
BRIGGS: It's okay, sweetie. Go back inside.
it's okay, sweetie. Daddy and I were just playing, okay?
it's okay. Yeah, we're just playing.
Yeah, me and Daddy were just fucking playing.
get up there.
Yeah, we'll play again.
daddy is okay.
it's all right.
what the fuck are you looking at?
CHRIS: You stay in the car, I'll go talk to her.
ANDY: Okay.
JEANIE: Hey, Chris. Hey, how are you?
Hi.
Hey.
everything okay?
Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you for a minute.
okay.
I got to get on the ship with Andy and try to fix this.
are you fucking kidding?
what am I going to do, let him go alone?
no, we're going to think of something else.
there's nothing else to do, okay?
I hate to tell you, but that little dumb fuck has put us in the worst possible position, okay?
and if they don't get the money from him, they're coming after us.
so what else do you want me to do?
you know what I don't want to do?
I don't want to fucking visit you in jail like we're visiting your dad, and raising those kids on my own.
so it's my...
I don't want to fight with you about this, okay?
I know what I'm doing, all right?
will you just trust me?
please?
nothing is going to happen.
all right? I promise. Mmm.
BUD: That shitbag Briggs was here for a couple of years.
he tried to smash some guy's head in with a cinder block.
look, I mentioned this to Sebastian.
we're doing another run.
can you get me on your old boat?
you mean the Borden?
remember when you were little, you and Sebastian, you broke into McTier's warehouse, stole all that Mardi Gras jewelry, and you came back to the house with a great big box of them beads?
you thought they were diamonds.
you were grinning like you just won the fucking lottery.
and you said, "You don't have to work on that boat no more.
I always think about that.
the proudest day of my life was when you turned legit, and you started your own business, and you got out of the life.
I know you got to do what you got to do.
I got it.
family is family.
I'll get you on the boat.
but you get in, you got to get back out.
CHRIS: Me and Andy are shipping out to Panama with the Borden.
SEBASTIAN: The old man's boat?
Yeah, he got us on.
what about Captain Camp?
I know. I know. Don't worry about it.
what's this?
what's what?
every time I come here, you got new shit.
I'm getting it together, I'm getting the place ready.
it's a bad-ass coffee table.
that is not for shoes.
I must be out of touch. I don't know what's bad-ass anymore because this looks cheap-ass.
you're turning into The Birdcage.
I mean...
so who do we know in Panama?
are you going to go see Ruben?
dude, no drugs.
what else has that kind of profit margin?
edwin is in Panama.
currency?
we have to bring back a shit-ton to make it worth our while.
all right, so I'll bring back a shit-ton.
okay, 15 million on four stacks this big.
it's like the size of a Mini Cooper.
where are you going to hide it?
that's my problem.
I need the Borden's crew manifest.
Oh, God. You got to be kidding me.
Oh, I like Tarik Mortin. He's a horrible chef, but he's great on runs.
le Cloud's a fucking drunk.
newlywed?
he's not great on runs, but we've known him a long time.
Olaf's solid, we need somebody in the engine room.
well, it's no A-Team, but it's the best we can do.
come on, work your magic. Make the call, get me a TWIC card.
Hi, sweet pea.
I need you to push through a TWIC card for Chris Farraday.
I got your message. It only took you three years to call me?
are you back in business?
no, no, no, no, no.
I need something, though.
remember our last run? The funny money?
I need that exact same shit by next week, but a lot more.
four times as much.
and we need a van big enough to transport it, okay?
okay. I'll be here.
come on, Mikey!
what's funny money?
huh? Nothing. That's just work stuff for Dad.
have you ever been convicted of espionage?
just answer yes or no, we'll get through this really quickly.
no.
sedition, or conspiracy to commit espionage, sedition, treason?
together?
I received your shipping application, Mr...
Mr. Lakowski.
senor Lakowski, I'm getting you a 20-foot standard dry.
would you like us to load it?
no, I've got somebody to take care of that. I just need the container.
okay, we'll leave the container standing by for you at the port of Panama.
and what are you shipping?
a van.
here you go.
it takes money to make money, baby.
thank you.
don't sink, Daddy.
okay, buddy.
you're going to miss my playoff game.
I know. I'm sorry.
your mom is going to take lots of pictures for me, okay?
you guys are in charge till I get back.
I love you, guys.
just come home, okay?
thank you for doing this, Chris.
I love you. Love you, too.
it's going to be okay.
ID, please. Finger on the scanner.
captain Camp. Get the trunk.
get that Captain's carpet cleaner up to the bridge.
LONGSHOREMAN: John, you want to give me a hand?
Hey!
you're up top. I get the bottom bunk.
Yeah, no kidding.
don't act like you don't like this shit.
why, is it that obvious?
I love it, but don't tell your sister.
all right, come on. You can get your beauty rest later, let's go.
my arm, my arm.
keep an eye out.
Hey, someone's coming.
man 1: What's up, Chris?
man 2: Hi, Chris.
Chris.
TARIK: Look at this motherfucker.
Olaf. Good to see you, man.
what's up, Tarik? You okay?
what's up, man?
how's your folks? Everybody's good? Good, good.
that's a hungry man's appetite.
this is real good.
how you doing, buddy?
what the fuck are you doing on my ship?
did you even check the goddamn crew manifest?
how the fuck do you let Bud Farraday's spawn aboard my ship?
DHS cleared him. He was added at the last minute.
all right, I'm demoting him to ship's boy.
Yes, sir.
camp: You scrub dirt and stay the fuck out of my sight.
otherwise you might have an accident, and wind up in the drink.
show him where the carpet cleaner is.
Yes, sir.
Danny: Oh, man, carpet cleaner.
let's go, Rug Doctor.
Oh, you got promoted? They gave you some new stripes on there.
I'll be ship's boy. You're still Captain's bitch boy.
Yeah, yeah.
okay.
Yes, sir.
everybody's drinking tall boys, and nobody's fucking working.
TARIK: What's up, man?
are you bringing the Captain in on this or what?
fuck, no.
well, I remember talking to your pops in this same room.
he said that same shit. We know how that turned out.
do you trust me or not?
I do. I do.
so what are we running?
a shipping pallet loaded up with 5, 000 uncut sheets of super notes.
best counterfeit money can buy.
and just how the hell do you think we're going to stow that much shit?
you worried, buddy? I mean, where is the faith?
what, I lost my stripes? Now I got to start from scratch?
Danny: Exactly, that shit's void.
no problem.
come on, I'll show you.
CHRIS: What do you think?
looks good. Chris, you're a crazy fucker.
not bad? Huh? Sixty cubic feet.
no fucking way. No, it's bigger than 60.
Ah, shit! Yeah, man, this is much bigger than 60.
we got company.
quick, quick, quick!
ANDY: Hey, what are you doing? Chris, stop!
CHRIS: Andy, be quiet in there.
come on, come on!
what the hell are you doing in here?
I needed a scraper. We noticed some mold in the lower hull.
the bleach wasn't cutting it, so...
well, you shouldn't be dicking around in here. Get going.
I was just trying to keep it clean for you, boss.
Hey, Chris! Chris!
CHRIS: Bring it right back up! Come on, you got it!
you got it, come on!
I can't do it.
TARIK: God damn.
are you getting on?
no.
do you want me to put you back in the box?
that's not funny.
I could have suffocated in that box.
I really could have...
leave the kid alone, man.
how are you going to pull this shit off?
we're delivering 300 or so containers. Yeah.
we're picking up 500 or more. We're not going to be in port that long.
so we got to drive out to Chorrillo, see Edwin, load up the bills, and then drive back to the boat during rush hour.
it's going to be tight, but we're going to be good.
it's going to be too tight. We're cutting it close.
might not have enough time.
we'll buy more time.
controllable pitch propeller.
Oh, yeah. Pitch propeller.
can you drain the oil supply?
the hydraulic chamber won't work.
that's the point, stupid ass.
CHRIS: Look.
we can do it while being towed through the locks.
it will buy us a couple of hours.
okay? I don't know.
I hate when we fuck with the boat.
what?
I said, I hate when we fuck with the boat.
CHRIS: Take it easy, big bear.
Olaf, fuck with the boat.
take it easy. Easy.
what the fuck?
Tarik. That motherfucker will eat you.
okay, out you come.
do you want to get any of these for me? Do we have to?
Yes, Mom.
yeah? Okay.
Kate: Hello?
can I help you?
you're pretty.
do you want to play?
okay. Bye, asshole.
BRIGGS: Pay the money, just like you owe me.
DESMOND: What the fuck are you all looking at?
BRIGGS: Yeah, you like that?
Kate: Get your fucking hands off me!
BRIGGS: Come on, put the knife down. Put the knife down.
put the knife down.
leave my mommy alone!
get the fuck back over there! Sit your fucking ass down!
it's okay, I'm just playing, now.
I'm just playing.
Yeah, don't cry.
DESMOND: You seen a gun before? You want it?
there ain't going to be no playing when I come back next week.
you can tell your husband that.
you want this? Get out!
No! MARCUS: What the fuck?
get the fuck out of my house! Get the fuck out of my house!
put that thing down, man!
you don't think the police are going to be coming now?
get the fuck out of here!
DESMOND: I didn't mean to shoot at him. The little shit hit the gun.
you want to send me back to the farm, you stupid bitch?
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
all right, careful. Not too much.
we don't want to jam it. I got it.
chief MATE ON RADIO: Chris Farraday, to the bridge.
here.
he's on his way.
not too much.
Danny: All right.
Kate: I wasn't getting reception on your cell.
Chris, these guys came to the house. They had guns.
Jesus, are you okay? Are the boys okay?
Yeah, we're okay. We're freaked out.
I think one of them was Tim Briggs, Kyle's brother.
I didn't call the police, I don't want them here asking questions.
call Sebastian, okay?
Yeah, okay, I will.
all right, I love you. Call him.
trouble with the missus, Farraday?
do you want me to talk to her for you?
SEBASTIAN: Hey, guys, you okay? You had a scary day?
both: Mmm-hmm.
you know what? Why don't you guys just come and stay at my place?
they're not going to be back, but just for my own peace of mind.
you think?
Really? Okay.
camp: Slow ahead.
I said, slow ahead! Reduce to half speed!
why are we not slowing down?
oil pressure's down.
crew MEMBER: All right. Keep an eye on that temperature.
full astern!
chief MATE: Full astern, Captain.
Yeah, Captain? Full astern!
we're going to hit the fucking dock!
I'm trying, but I got no pitch control. The fucking prop is jammed!
you drained too much oil out! I didn't want you to crash the boat!
what?
olaf: Come on! I'm not getting any oil pressure!
let go the port anchor!
Jesus, fucking...
let go the fucking port anchor!
it's not moving! DANNY: Did you release the brake?
get out of the way! Move!
turn starboard!
camp: It's too late! Hard to port, Luke! Hard to port!
olaf: I'm going to have to kill the engine!
fucking...
we're going to hit!
what the fuck is going on around here?
what the fuck happened?
propeller jam.
someone tampered with it.
I don't think so.
someone tampered with it.
sorry about that oil thing.
don't worry about it.
it will buy us a little more time.
EDDIE: Hey, Michael, look. It's like a spaceship over here.
wow, Sebastian, it's amazing in here.
yeah? It's coming along, right?
I forgot you haven't been here since the renovation.
Hey, don't touch that.
fellas, you hang on to this.
okay, that's good.
good aim.
CHRIS: Hey, everything okay?
Kate: Yeah we're at Sebastian's.
are the boys okay?
Yeah. Are you in Panama already?
Yeah. Keep your phone on you.
I love you.
I love you, too. I'll call you on my way back.
we're almost there.
EDWIN: Hey! Whoa!
you got a lot of pussy in here.
good to see you, man.
everything good? Yeah.
good, you got the cash, the van?
Si, si. Cool.
Yeah.
Danny: Whoa.
what, you don't trust me?
Oh, I trust you.
esta bueno?
no, it's no fucking bueno.
Andy, wait here. Danny, come on.
Hey, what is it? What are you doing?
I need some iodine.
the ink is OVI, the layers are right, but that paper felt different.
Hey, quepasa? What's going on?
you better hope I'm wrong.
you fucking idiots didn't print this on starch-free paper.
I'm sorry, man. This is the best I have.
I don't have time for this.
I told you on the phone,
I needed exactly what you sold me last time.
Gonzalo. Gonzalo has it at the warehouse.
Gonzalo? That little shithead who works for Jesus?
no. There's no more Jesus.
Gonzalo is running things now.
why didn't you send me to him in the first place?
are you fucking playing games with me? Are you fucking playing...
I tried! But he doesn't want anybody going there!
no, no, no.
we're going to the warehouse. Let's go.
no, no, no, no, no.
Chris.
EDWIN: Hey, Chris, man, look, take the van, man. I'm sorry.
Kate: Come on, Mikey!
man, the sun's really killing me.
that kid is big. He is. Number 11 is a big kid.
hold on, I got to take this.
okay.
Hey, man, what's up?
he didn't have them.
all right.
well, I guess you're going to have to bring in some candy.
I'm not bringing in drugs.
just go and see Ruben.
I told you, I'm not bringing in drugs. Okay. It's not an option.
Chris, Chris, Chris, I'm begging you. Please.
Chris? Yeah, Chris?
put him in the fucking van.
you know, you come back empty-handed,
Andy's going to get fucking hit, and you're still gonna have to come up with the goddamn money.
look, I'll figure it out, okay?
just keep Briggs away from my family, please.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, I got a little problem at work I got to take care of.
see you later, buddy.
Bye, Sebastian. Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine. You got your key?
Yeah.
I'm telling you, man. Stay away from Gonzalo.
he's been acting crazy lately, since he became a boss.
stay away from him.
Danny: Chris, we should have listened to him.
we got less than an hour to get back to the boat. It ain't going to work.
it will work.
I mean, do you even know where Gonzalo's warehouse is?
we're in fucking Chorrillo right now.
I'm looking for something to remind me.
we're going to find it.
here we go. Here we go. Look, right here! Here!
camp: Mortin. Yeah, Cap?
where the hell is Farraday?
I don't know, Cap.
I didn't know I had to babysit him today. I didn't get the memo.
don't piss me off, Mortin.
you'll be flipping shit-burgers at McDonald's before you can say "minimum wage.
I'm sorry, Cap. Sorry.
that little visit you paid Kate, the kids, Chris' family?
that's my family.
you stay away from them. Are we clear?
Hi, Sadie.
Hi.
you know, if you had hired a real smuggler instead of Andy, our package would have come in when it was supposed to.
you know, I'm really sorry about that.
do you know how fucked up things are for me right now?
I know. He said he knew what he was doing.
I didn't know he was his brother-in-law.
Danny: Hey, man, this is way more high-risk than I originally anticipated.
I got a wife now. I like my wife.
Yeah, I got a wife, too, okay?
and don't worry about Gonzalo.
I know him, he's a little fucking punk. Don't worry about it.
Oh, yeah? I heard stories about this dude cutting people's heads off and shit.
I'm looking for Gonzalo.
Andy, stay in the van with the bag.
Danny, it's all good. I know this guy, come on.
VOICEMAIL: You have one new message.
BRIGGS: Hey, fuckhead, I'm watching your sister's kid play soccer.
you don't call me back,
I'm gonna walk out on that field and put a bullet in his head.
Chris.
ANDY: Don't... Stop talking.
like I said, I want you to take the buy money and go to that address, and talk to a gentleman named Ruben.
if you ever want to see your little nephew again, you take the package and you bring it back, all right?
Danny: Hey, is that a wolf?
that ain't no fucking dog.
excuse me, senor. Do you mind?
where is he?
where is my old friend Farraday?
bring the van around.
sorry for showing up unannounced.
edwin was trying to play games with me.
Where's my buddy Jesus?
we fed him to the wolves.
what, literally?
I am the new Jesus, cabron.
it's good to see you.
you, too.
what do you think?
it's all mine, motherfucker.
all those assholes who thought I was shit?
they're dead por culeros.
we're taking down a truck.
it's a big one. An armored truck.
do you want to join us? Huh?
are you serious?
Andy?
Andy!
Oh, fuck.
Andy!
Michael: He charges...
Michael, not in the house. We're guests.
look at young Daddy.
Michael: He shoots!
he scores!
go find your mom.
you ain't fucking around, huh? Looks like you're ready for anything.
are you going to war or something?
I told you. We're taking down a truck. Fucking rock and roll.
CHRIS: No shit. You got all these guys.
what the fuck is in that truck, man?
you want to know?
then maybe you should show these assholes how it's done.
no, look...
I'll give you the super notes for free.
Yeah, thanks anyway. But I got a boat to catch, so...
come on. Don't tell me you don't miss this shit.
I got two kids now, man, you know? My cowboy days are over.
come on, Danny!
the money's gone.
and Andy.
what?
what the fuck are you talking about?
you come in here and treat me like an asshole?
no, primo, I wouldn't do that, man.
I should fucking blow your brains out.
does that offer still stand?
we ride with you, I get the super notes for free?
Yeah, there's something you can do for us.
grab their wallets.
give him your wallet.
give me their IDs.
we're being fined every minute longer we sit here, Captain.
Yep.

just stall them for as long as you can, okay?

exactly.
I mean, what are we supposed to be doing here?
blocking the truck.

we're blocking the truck.
like human speed bumps.
tell my wife that...
will you shut the fuck up?

Danny: How much time do you think we have?
CHRIS: No time.

I need to tell you...
are you out of your fucking mind?
are you fucking crazy?
Where's the money? Where is it?
it's gone! I had to use it.
it's what? Where's the money?
what are you trying to...
what did you just say to me?
I had to use it.
you what?
I had to use it.
it's in the ceiling.
no, you fucking...
how fucking stupid are you?
I came out here to help you, to risk my fucking freedom and my wife and my children for this?
motherfucker.
what the fuck am I supposed to do with all that?
you got to be the dumbest motherfucker...
he said he was going to kill Michael.
CHRIS: What?
VOICEMAIL: You have one saved message.
BRIGGS: Hey, fuckhead, I'm watching your sister's kid play soccer.
you don't call me back,
I'm gonna walk out on that field and put a bullet in his head.
get the bag.
are you all right? Yeah.
you all right? You all right?
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
I'm sorry. Calm down, calm down.
Chris. CHRIS: Hey.
everything okay? Boys all right?
Yeah, they're sleeping.
what's up? Is everything okay? Is Andy okay?
Yeah. Don't worry about it. Is Sebastian there?
Kate: Yeah, he is. Do you want me to get him for you?
no, no.
no, it's okay. Go back to sleep.
I'll call you in the morning.
Kate: Okay. I love you.
I love you, too.
SEBASTIAN: Chris?
Chris, I've been trying to call you. What's going on?
Andy picked something up.
Really? I thought we weren't doing that.
I didn't have a choice.
thank God for Andy taking the initiative, though, huh?
too bad I'm not bringing it in.
I'm thinking of dumping it in the sea, actually.
why would you do that?
then we would all be fucked!
take it on faith.
I need to talk to you.
SEBASTIAN: Is something wrong?
I told you I would call you with an update.
you've got a few more days left before I cut your head off and stick it up your ass.
and you're asking me, "Is there anything wrong?
well, I got something coming in.
you don't sound so sure.
I'm sure. It's coming in.
flying solo ain't for sidekicks, Abney.
I fucking warned you.
when you first came to me for help in keeping your little business afloat,
I fucking warned you.
I said, "You've got to know your limitations.
don't live beyond your fucking means!
I don't normally do this fucking shit.
telling you what's going to happen when you don't pay.
what's the fucking point? You know the rules, right?
right.
you take care, Abney.
Jack, neat.
somebody's off the wagon.
I want you to go see Kate.
man, I thought she was your family.
you know, if you want to fuck his wife, you fuck his wife.
but don't waste my time so you can play hero.
Chris is falling apart out there.
he's going to dump the package.
don't touch her. Just get her attention.
all right.
Yeah.
Oh, man.
do you think it's going to work?
it's going to work. You think so?
did you take science in school, Tarik?
Yeah.
then you should know salt dissolves in water, bitch.
are you leaving soon?
Yeah, Sebastian is dropping the boys off.
we're going home.
Oh, that's right. Chris is coming home.
Yeah.
so, you'll be all smiles in the morning?
I hope so.
you get out of here, I got it.
good night.
good night. Good night, baby.
I'll lock the door.
Thanks.
Oh, my God!
get the fuck away from me!
my friend will be here, he'll kick your...
I'm going to be perfectly fucking clear.
you call your husband and you tell him not to dump it in the water!
you tell him that you, Michael and Eddie are all depending on him.
do you understand me?
do you understand me?
stay away from my kids!
he's got a gun!
Whoa! What are you doing?
Hey.
are you all right?
honey, I want you to get in the truck with me.
the kids are inside, all right?
you smell like alcohol.
Yeah, I had a drink.
you're driving my kids around drunk? Are you fucking kidding me?
relax. What did he say to you?
come on, get out. We're going in my car. Let's go.
SEBASTIAN: Kate! Guys, get back in the car.
Kate, what are you doing?
Kate! Kate! Get in the truck.
fuck.
Kate ON PHONE: He knew the kids' names.
hold on, you're breaking up, okay? Let me go outside.
Oh, fuck.
cell service sucks here on the river. Hold on, I'm going outside.
Hello? He told me to tell you...
no, hold on. I can't hear you.
he told me to tell you not to dump it in...
Chris, please come home.
Chris?
Chris?
Hey, how did it go?
we boarded up the front window.
the cops took a report. They're looking for the guy.
all right.
they want to talk to you.
Yeah. I'm going to go by in the morning.
they want to talk to you now.
but we have no stuff. I've got to go to Sebastian's to get our stuff.
would you mind watching the boys for a second?
look at your forehead.
are you sure you don't need me to take you to the hospital?
no, it's just... It looks worse than it is.
it just hurts. Like a bruise, you know?
I think I should go now before I can't. You know what I mean?
I'll see you in a little bit.
goodbye, Mom. I love you.
be good boys.
Sebastian?
did you tell Briggs I was going to dump it?
no. I didn't tell nobody.
don't lie to me.
Chris, I'm not fucking lying to you. I didn't say shit.
where did you get the drugs?
from a guy called Ruben.
Kate: Sebastian?
Hey.
Hi. I'm just getting our stuff.
are you hungry? Let me make you some food.
no, I can't.
the boat's not coming in. I got to get back to the boys.
Chris will be back tonight.
no, he's not. He's not coming home tonight.
I mean, the boat's not coming in for, like, I don't know, tomorrow.
Chris told me that I had to take care of you, so I'm going to take care of you.
Sebastian, are you not hearing me? We'll be fine, okay?
Yeah, we're fine.
okay, good. All right. Good.
give me a hug.
okay. Okay.
it's been such a big day.
what the fuck are you doing?
nothing. I'm not doing anything.
I'm trying to give my friend a fucking kiss. What's your problem?
what's your problem? Kate, come on.
look, I mean, did you even see this?
stop it.
Kate.
how long have we known each other?
you know what? Get your hands off me!
Kate? Kate!
leave me the fuck alone!
SEBASTIAN: Kate!
Kate!
Jesus Christ. Kate!
I'm trying to have a conversation with you, and you're acting like a fucking child.
okay. Good. Why don't you just walk away from the door, and let me get out of here.
an ungrateful child. A little fucking brat, who's not grateful for...
do you want to talk to Chris about what a fucking bitch I am?
I'm going to fucking call him on the phone right now!
don't call Chris.
sweetheart, I love you, but open the door.
I'm calling Chris!
don't mess with his head now!
why don't you fucking tell him?
shit!
honey, I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Kate?
Kate, it's not funny. Stop fucking around.
fuck.
you're going to be okay. You're going to be okay.
shit.
Kate?
Kate! Kate!
Hey.
I know what you did.
I know Briggs works for you.
you stay the fuck away from my family, or I'm going to kill you.
you hear me?
just bring in the package. Everything's going to be fine.
I'm not bringing in shit.
you'll never see that fucking package.
you know, I didn't know about...
I can't believe you. You fucking played me.
I'm not playing you.
I'm coming. I'm coming for you.
okay.
captain Camp.
Sebastian.
what do you want, Abney?
Chris Farraday is running shit.
okay.
he's going to dump the package.
if you make sure he doesn't, I will give you his share.
Jesus, Abney. You are one cold rat bastard.
all right.
but if Farraday don't give it up,
I'm going to call in the dogs, and your package is getting seized.
no, he'll tell you where it is. He won't risk doing time.
camp: Next time you want to run shit on my ship, you do it right and pay a fare like everybody else.
camp: Where is it? Where's what?
you're running something. I know you're running something.
I'm not running anything, Captain.
you want to play that way? Check.
this is your one chance.
you give it up now, or you want me to call CBP?
I'm not running anything.
your wife asked me to bring some Panamanian dog shit home for her to eat and rub in her fucking cunt...
fuck you, you piece of shit. But I didn't have time.
you dumb-ass motherfucker! This is how you want it?
Yeah, this is how I want it.
you want to go down just like your dumb-ass daddy, you piece of shit mick?
fuck this.
you made it now, motherfucker.
right?
whatever it is, CBP is going to find it.
Yeah, he's in the cafeteria.
you're clear.
come on, come on.
shit! Pick up the phone, buddy.
customs and Border Protection, Port of New Orleans.
it's Redmond, line two.
Redmond.
Yeah, John, I've got a good tip.
somebody's making a run on my ship.
Really?
all right, listen up, guys and gals,
I want an interdiction team ready for deployment in 20 minutes.
let's go.
male DISPATCHER: Flight 104, copy that. Three minutes to contact.
ready. Standing by.
holy shit!
well, it was good while it lasted.
who the fuck called the cavalry in?
second MATE: Inspection, please!
all crew. Everybody.
who's in here?
welcome aboard.
all right, gentlemen, sit down.
what the fuck is going on?
Larry, check the ceiling.
take it down.
Wow! Look at this.
CBP OFFICER: There's nothing in there.
there's nothing in there?
shit!
second MATE: That's enough.
a tarp.
tool box with nothing in it.
you said you thought it smelled funny, right?
Yes, Captain.
maybe it's just been cleaned. That's about it.
could be covering up something, maybe?
could be.
second MATE: Watch your step.
just put the carpet cleaner in the trunk.
you got it?
just put it right there, that's fine.
fuck.
Oh, shit.
davis: The van in D-7.
what about it?
we're taking it apart now.
but you can just save us the trouble, and tell us what's in it.
I would love to help you, but I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
do you think we're stupid?
LAIRD: And who is Jib Lakowski?
it says right there, he's the guy shipping the van, so maybe you should talk to him.
he died in 2004.
then I guess he's not going to need the van. Huh?
what's up, Houdini?
you got something for me?
what are you talking about?
come on, man. Just give it to him.
what the fuck are you talking about?
come on, man!
Yeah, I didn't think so. Say goodbye to Andy.
Chris! Chris! MARCUS: Shut the fuck up!
ANDY: Don't fuck me, man!
what are you doing?
ANDY: Chris!
run, Andy!
fuck, Briggs.
pull the fucking trigger!
you don't get your dope if I'm dead.
here.
this is it right here.
right here?
Yeah.
what, you got your grandma selling cocaine?
it's my friend's place.
BRIGGS: You better not be messing around,
I'll put a bullet in your face.
CHRIS: All right, take it easy. Come on.
DESMOND: Is your friend home? CHRIS: Quiet.
trust me, you don't want to wake this fucker up.
male DISPATCHER: One, state your position, please.
211, responding.
we have a home security alarm triggered at 452 King Drive.
BRIGGS: Hey, you got some rich friends, man.
come on.
shut that door.
Whoo! That's some world-class smuggling right there, man.
Yeah!
MARCUS: We got it now, man.
check this out.
this is the shit, man.
check this out.
Yeah.
Oh, that's some real booger-sugar right there.
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
it's good?
Yeah, yeah.
great. I'm going to take a piss,
I've been holding it since I got off the boat.
all right, you do that.
it doesn't want to come out, man.
they make it stubborn...
who the hell are you?
what the fuck are you doing in my goddamn house?
BRIGGS: Go back to bed, old man.
MARCUS: Shit, it's Five-O!
get the fuck out! Pack that shit up, man.
Jeanie, is Kate there? She's not picking up her phone.
are the boys with you?
Yeah, the boys are here. She left a while ago.
said she was going to Sebastian's to get their stuff.
listen, if she calls you, tell her to call me right away.
camp: Absolutely fucking ridiculous.
I've never seen these idiots before in my life.
that one dumbshit right there is bleeding all over my couch, and they're cutting up their drugs.
CHRIS: Kate?
Kate!
Sebastian!
I want you guys to pour the cement on the south corner first.
can we start on the south corner first?
woman ON RADIO: We're set up for the other side. No, we can't.
south corner first, hurry the hell up.
you guys have milked this fucking job long enough!
hold it!
man: We're pouring over on the south corner. Take it over there.
what the hell's going on here? I thought we were doing the other side.
why are you moving the cement truck?
you're blocking the fucking trucks.
you send guys to my house?
huh? I trusted you with my wife and my kids.
and I fucking loved you like a brother.
where is Kate?
where the fuck is Kate?
one more fucking time. Where's Kate?
she's gone.
are you okay, Seb?
man: Whose phone is this?
who left their phone here?
turn that fucking thing off, now!
Chris?
Oh, my God!
turn that fucking thing off!
call an ambulance!
Oh, fuck.
call an ambulance!
call a fucking ambulance, now!
man: Yeah, I need an ambulance...
CHRIS: Oh, shit.
...at West Bank Trucking Company. Yeah, right away.
are you sure this is the right place?
Yeah.
these are the coordinates Chris gave me when he dropped it.
we're definitely in the right place.
Chris.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I got that. And you got one.
you cheated. It's mine.
Danny: Oh!
Yeah!
Danny: Oh, man! I can't believe it.
a sea full of money!
we got to get in.
get it in here. Yeah.
pull it in. Be careful, it's slippery right there.
Whoa!
are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
bud?
AUCTIONEER: And I have sold it.
4, 500, number 106. Next one.
call lot number 122. Come bid 300.
a high of 300, I have to get 400.
got 400, got a $500 bid. Five-and-a-half?
five to six-and-a-half.
I'm going to seven, going to seven-and-a-half.
can I have an $800 bid? Get an 800?
and I have sold it.
seven-and-a-half to number 77. Thank you, sir. Next one.
church: I'll take it off your hands for 2. 5.
CHRIS: I'm not taking any less than three.
okay, three.
come on.
so you were down in Panama, were you?
Yeah.
did you hear about that famous painting by Jackson Pollock?
it got ripped off in Panama.
come on, it's been all over the news.
no. No idea.
what's that thing worth, anyway?
about 140 million.
what's that, 20 on the black market?
at least.
I'm in the wrong business, huh?
get in, get in.
hurry up!
Whoo!
Wow. Whoo!
twenty.
twenty! It's twenty!
CHRIS: Twenty million.
Danny: Yes!
we've wanted this for so long...
a life without "A," and Ali back.
people are preparing for Ali's return and it's not with flowers and Welcome Home banners.
I'm going back to school.
and if we just stick together, everything is going to be fine.
there was still a girl in that grave.
someone killed her.
and Jessica was going to say that it was you.
I'm really worried that my dad tried to stop her.
you think that your dad... - Yeah.
and so does my mom.
I mean, she practically admitted it.
I can't stop thinking about Shana's family.
every time I close my eyes, all I can see is her grandmother.
you're just going to have to find a way to forgive yourself.
can't tell if this is Mars or a satellite.
do you have the coordinates?
like, business conservative? I'd rather wear vomit.
okay, but we have to find the planet so that we can study it.
look, there's no rule that says you have to walk into school with her tomorrow.
well, it's not written down but it's understood.
we're gonna walk down those hallways with Ali and everyone will think what they've always thought.
which is what?
that we're her puppets. - But you're not.
so who cares what they think?
Hey.
people know who you are, Hanna.
they do?
cause lately I don't.
EZRA: Are you still having nightmares about Shana?
I see her everywhere. Everywhere.
it's like she's haunting me for what I did to her.
look, all right, all right.
this isn't about Shana.
this is you doing this to yourself.
okay?
I wish I could fix this for you.
and I know it's silly but...
I keep waiting for that "A" message.
that picture doesn't exist.
you don't have to live in fear of your cell phone anymore.
no? Tell that to my right eye.
it still twitches every time I get a text.
what's she doing out this late? - I don't know.
since she's been back she's practically lived in her bedroom.
is this a date?
no. - No.
ali, what are you doing? Who was that?
Oh, my dad forgot my enrollment forms on his desk.
and he's stuck at home on a call, so his flunky dropped me off.
do you want me to talk to your dad?
good luck finding him.
he's avoiding me like the plague.
does Alison know?
what you think he did to her mom?
it's not the kind of information
so if action is character, then who is Alison now?
been reading Fitzgerald?
I've been re-reading Fitzgerald.
I already know Alison's story but I find it hard to picture her as a victim.
she seems really genuine when she says that what she's been through changed her.
and I want to believe her.
but you don't.
how can I believe a story that I haven't been told?
I mean, if the truth is in the details, we still don't know what happened to her.
Spencer, we wouldn't be us if we didn't believe in second chances.
it's Jenna.
I didn't know you two were talking again.
we're not.
I haven't talk to her since she moved to New York.
hello.
I'll be right there.
what's going on?
Shana is dead.
she could hardly get out the words, but Jenna said she was murdered.
Emily: I'm sorry, Spence.
okay, nobody likes lying to Toby.
but if he finds out what happened in New York...
just tell him the truth.
if you're lying to protect me, you don't need to.
it's your decision, Spencer. It's not hers.
Alison, you don't have to stand watch.
Spencer said that Toby was taking her home.
Jenna's not coming here.
he said she sounded broken.
she's still full-on blind, right?
Hey, no offense, but if she's sad she could cry in New York.
let's face it, we blinded Jenna, we killed her girlfriend.
she's back to punish us for it.
said with absolutely no tact but you're right.
I had no idea that Jenna was living in New York.
which means that Shana was lying when she said that Jenna didn't know that she was after us.
she came home to finish what Shana started.
and I still don't have time for a hobby.
what?
you guys have put up with so much to help me.
and I've made a lot of enemies.
but it's not going to be us against them tomorrow.
just like I'm working to earn back your trust,
does that include Jenna?
you can do this.
maybe she's not coming.
Oh, she's coming.
we should have picked her up.
why didn't we pick her up?
her dad wanted to drop her off.
guys, I don't think she's coming,
I think she's here.
girl: You guys coming this weekend? BOY: Yeah, I'm planning on it.
girl: Once a bitch, always a bitch.
boy: Hey, Ali, remember me?
do they love her or do they hate her?
I can't tell.
HANNA: Wait, Ali knows Cindy and Mindy? - Hey, Cindy. Hey, Mindy.
she used to call them "gayrons.
Gayrons?
Yeah, like gay morons.
so that's the Queen Of Mean?
I can't watch this.
you're leaving?
ready?
thanks for waiting for me.
ali, do you know where your first class is?
but I can't remember where it is.
I've got chem lab.
it's close. I can walk with you.
Thanks, Em.
well, I hope you have a good first day back.
Yeah.
call us if you need us.
we'll meet up for lunch, okay?
Thanks.
for everything.
I can't believe she's actually back in school.
as abnormal as this is, it kind of feels normal.
baby steps.
please report to the office.
please report to the principal's office.
mom?
honey, I'm sorry to have to do this at school.
what's going on?
we have to go home and pack.
what for?
I'm leaving your father...
and you're coming with me.
let's do something nobody else in this school is doing today.
let's talk about somebody other than Alison.
gladly.
I'm having a party so she can meet all my friends.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
what's she like?
see for yourself.
the party starts at 7.
can I bring Travis?
of course.
great. See you later.
is Melissa coming with us?
you need a jacket.
and that gray sweater that you love, let's bring that.
mom!
but right now I need you to stay focused on helping me get us out of here.
mom, I need you to be honest with me.
we're not running.
you pulled me out of school so that we could be gone before Dad gets home.
does he even know that we're leaving?
damn it, Spencer. When you latch onto things...
I just want to know the truth!
your father did take me to a spa.
but I never checked in.
I was working with a private investigator.
then the night that Jessica was killed, your dad and Melissa told me that they went to a diner in Ridgeville.
that was a lie.
you think that both of them...
I thought your father and I had an understanding.
we always agreed that, no matter what, we would never involve you and Melissa in all of the...
all of the what?
mom?
I want you to know that I'll take care of you.
we'll take care of each other.
Emily: Spence, call us back.
we're getting worried.
I haven't seen Ali since first period.
maybe they skipped.
no, Ali sent a text.
she's in guidance counselor hell.
with everything going on with Spencer's family,
I don't like not knowing where she is.
I was thinking about going to Jenna's after school.
I can swing by Spencer's.
okay, back up. Why would you be going to Jenna's?
because I believe what Toby told Spencer.
and if Jenna's broken because of what I did...
I don't know, maybe there's something
I can do to help.
what could you do to help?
Yeah, last night you thought she was staring blind daggers at you.
both of you, back off, okay?
I'm just saying, if she's not looking for us or smelling for us, then...
and I hope you have a carefree senior year, Em.
but I've got to find a way to live with what I did in New York.
okay, Aria...
I can be sorry for her loss.
all right? That's what I can do.
the glee club's sponsoring Frozen sing-a-long tonight.
I think I'm more of an Adele Dazeem than Idina Menzel.
it's free pizza on a school night.
you sure that doesn't trump 20 Questions with your mom?
is it okay if I hum?
I'll see you at 7?
Yeah.
I'm surprised you came to practice.
I heard you went home early.
I wasn't feeling well. But it passed.
are you sure you didn't leave because of Alison?
I know she's your friend, but even being in the same room with her makes me feel sick.
well, if you're staying out of school to try and avoid her, then she still has power over you.
then she still has power over me...
because I can't stand to be in the same room with her.
I hate seeing you so upset.
I'm fine. - No, you're not.
you're one of the bravest people I know, and I'm not going to let you forget that.
JENNA: Who's there?
is someone there?
do you want me to leave?
it's okay if you stay.
Paige?
it's up to you, Emily.
thanks for getting us together, Em.
Paige and I are both lucky to have you as a friend.
that's the only thing we have in common.
I am ashamed of the way I treated you.
I put people down to...
feel better about myself.
you are a terrible person, Alison.
and I hated you for it.
I didn't care if you were dead.
I was happy you were gone.
I'm sorry.
for what you did to me or for yourself?
for all of it.
you were actually the first person 'Cause I remembered how hard it was for you when your dad left.
God, I can't believe he'd risk everything to kill Mrs. D.
the police were asking questions about the girl that was in Ali's grave...
and he was just trying to protect me.
he thought Mrs. D. was gonna set me up to take the fall for it.
Travis is downstairs.
Spencer, I saw your mom at The Bradbury yesterday.
is everything okay at home?
Yeah, we're just having plumbing issues.
Ohh. Well, tell Veronica we're here to help if you need anything.
Thanks, Mrs. Marin.
Spence, you could have told her the truth.
not about the murder part, but about your parents splitting up.
she would never judge that.
I'm not really even sure why I lied.
I know that we've never really been like a warm
we're here for you, Spence.
I promise.
you want to order some food?
uh, I already have plans.
it's a school thing.
can I tag along?
I invited Paige.
so...
Yeah, I get it.
so I'm sure this sounds lame, but do you care if I stay for a little bit?
my dad's working late, and I just...
I don't want to go home to an empty house.
Yeah.
my mom's in the den if you need anything.
when I was talking to Paige
I realized that I owe you an apology, too.
I always made you think that your feelings for me
those kisses weren't just for practice.
I don't know what you want me to say.
you don't have to say anything.
why are you telling me this now?
I just thought you should know.
what are you doing here?
man: Hey, blondie, come hang out with us.
could you keep it down, Biff?
this is a coffee shop, not the locker room.
BIFF: You looking for a fight, man?
no, no. He's just a little bit irritable.
he hasn't had his coffee yet.
Caleb, when did you get back?
BARISTA: Two coffees for Hanna.
and... why haven't you called me?
better get your coffees.
Caleb, where are you? Why aren't you answering my calls?
are you mad at me?
can you just call me back so I can find you?
you dropped your phone.
thank you.
God, this punch is so tasty.
it's best consumed rapidly and repeatedly.
Cheers. - Cheers.
where is your girlfriend?
I...don't see her right now.
are you sure that she's even real?
Oh, she's real, all right.
Lucas, you're doing it with her!
okay, now that is consumed best rapidly and repeatedly.
whoa, you okay?
Hey, cowboy, where have you been?
I've been looking for you all night.
you're the one that's been on your phone all night, Hanna.
Aw, let me rub that bald head of yours.
okay, come on.
I think you've had enough.
actually, you don't know what I think.
you don't even know the half of it.
come on, come on.
Oh, there we go.
did I just say that you don't even know the half of it?
Mm-hmm.
here you go.
Bridget Woo just told me she saw Jenna tonight.
she's probably drunk.
Jenna or Bridget?
she also told me Shana's dead.
who are these people?
Jenna's a blind girl who used to go to our school.
her and Shana were dating, right?
I don't know what they were.
you don't like her?
Alison and Jenna hated each other.
my friends and I didn't realize we had been drafted into their war before it was too late.
too late for what?
announcer: Three minutes till show time, folks.
find your seats and your duet partners.
so are you Anna or Elsa?
I'm humming.
I knew it was you in my room today.
you scared me.
what were you doing in my house?
do you want to...
do you want to come inside? I can make some tea.
what I would like is an answer.
I heard about Shana.
so I was just coming to see if you were okay.
why would you care if I'm okay?
look, with Ali back, it's just...
it's bringing up a lot of stuff for everyone, and...
we all feel really terrible about our part in the accident.
I was... - Placating your guilt?
look, I might be the last person on earth that you want to talk to right now.
but for two years, we felt that Alison was dead.
so I know how it feels to lose someone.
right.
but you still have your friends.
I don't have anybody left.
right, but I guess that is nobody's fault but my own.
are you sure you don't want to come in for that tea?
I didn't really know Shana that well, but if you...
if you wanted to come in and talk and tell me about her...
I think that would help.
thank you, Aria.
you don't scare me, Mona.
you're not as good of a liar as you used to be.
I know you were all in New York the night Shana was murdered.
and I can prove it.
what do you want, Mona?
what I've always wanted...
and that's for you to leave town.
I don't care where you go or how you get there.
I want you gone.
I'm not a threat to you.
you may have convinced Hanna and the others that you changed.
and maybe you are trying to be a decent person, but that won't last for long.
people do change.
when someone shows me who they are,
I believe them.
I don't need to be taught a lesson more than once.
you're suddenly the victim of what, Mona?
my bullying?
what do you call what you did to those girls?
you almost killed Hanna.
no one feels worse about that than I do.
but I'm all better now. Even the doctors say so.
I don't believe you.
if you could prove that we were in New York, you would have done it already.
I'm back and I'm staying, so get used to it.
no one wants you here.
you're wrong, Mona.
just like before, everyone wants to be my friend.
and that's what you're afraid of.
all I had to do was say "I'm sorry" to Cindy and Mindy and they were practically begging me to sit at their lunch table.
you're scared because you know that it's not gonna take me long to win over your army of losers.
I made you Loser Mona once, and you know I can do it again.
we don't have to do this.
leave me alone.
Hey, Han, we're all at Ali's.
you might be asleep, but just call us when you get this.
I don't think it was a coincidence that all of you were busy tonight.
did you see who was driving?
it couldn't have been Mona.
she got into that church way too fast.
she had help.
sounds like an ambush.
you're shaking.
Hey, here.
well, what did you do when she slapped you?
I just stared at her.
look, I think you're right.
if Mona had any proof that we were in New York, she would have used it by now.
she was just trying to scare you.
well, she succeeded.
I would be madder than a skunk at Travis if he weren't as baffled by your behavior as I am.
when you sober up we're having a serious talk about consequences.
and yours won't just be a hangover.
okay, Mother.
but if you don't stop spinning the room, I'm going to throw up.
thanks for not being mad at me.
Oh, I'm mad at you, Hanna.
but I know you won't remember, so we'll talk about it tomorrow.
okay, Mother.
why would you do this to yourself?
Caleb's back.
Ali's really missing her mom tonight.
okay. I will.
she's okay with me staying over.
she said to give you a big hug.
you probably don't remember what I told you when I pulled you out of that barn.
I remember every word...
but I don't know what's real and what I made up.
you said you missed me the most.
you were the hardest one to leave behind.
look, I... I know that there's no more "A,
but you should seriously still lock your door.
you stopped by Paula's?
Yeah, it's key lime.
why pie?
why not pie?
Jenna's all alone now.
she's all alone, and she's blaming herself.
I just wanted to tell her that she should blame me.
you should both be blaming Shana.
she was the one that was holding the gun, remember?
ali, she always thought that Jenna was manipulating Shana, but I think that Jenna actually loved her.
look, Aria, you have to stop beating yourself up for this.
I don't know how I'm going to get past it.
do you see this?
this is what she did to me.
I'm lucky to be alive, and so are you.
just like she told you, remember?
Shana wasn't playing a game.
I'm so sorry.
Ali? Are you asleep?
does that hurt?
I can handle it.
if you feel as bad as you look...
not so loud.
so how does Mona know that we were in New York?
she's Mona.
but how did she send that "New York minute" text to your burner phone the night we got back into town?
what are you going to do with a satellite?
the point is that you can learn to do anything on the Web.
using a Bluetooth sniper rifle,
you can be blue-snarfed in seconds,
so Mona blue-snarfed us?
what's going on?
some people really did hope that you changed.
we're not afraid of you, Mona.
afraid of me?
what lies has she told you?
Alison attacked me last night.
I turned my phone to video.
you're scared because you know it's not gonna take me long to win over your army of losers.
I made you Loser Mona once and you know I can do it again.
it's...
that is the last time I underestimate that bitch.
how are you going to try and spin this one, Ali?
I mean, we know you're a great liar, so I'm sure this is going to be a good one.
everything I told you last night was true.
she slapped me first. I swear it.
I didn't tell you that I slapped her back because I felt terrible about it.
loser Mona"? Really?
are we back to that again?
I know how it looks.
but you know what she's capable of.
I mean, she set me up.
come on, guys.
I mean, Spence, you landed in Radley because of one of those elaborate stunts she pulled.
maybe Mona deserved it.
but you went out of your way to lie to us.
again.
nice car.
it used to be mine.
they don't want things to go back to the way they were.
they remember how Alison treated them.
like they were her dolls.
good.
then maybe we can really get rid of her.
so what does a world without "A" look like?
we can do that all on our own.
are you mad at me for waiting so long to tell you?
Spence, get over here.
all I want you to know is that you're never alone.
not even for a second.
I thought I'd find you here.
why haven't you returned my calls?
Travis is a nice guy.
I didn't come back to screw that up.
so why did you come back?
did you change your hair because Alison's back?
probably.
em, I know I screwed up.
em, will you look at me please?
why wouldn't you just tell us the truth?
it's so much easier than lying.
please.
that's not going to fix this.
news ANCHOR: There is breaking news tonight in the investigation of the Jane Doe who was buried in Alison DiLaurentis's grave.
we expect the Rosewood Police Department
did Miranda find her family?
I don't know.
the night you left Ravenswood was the last time I saw her.
you have to come with me.
we gotta go.
Caleb, come on.
TV: ...the Rosewood police chief - will be making a statement any moment now... - Guys, it's starting.
announcing the identity of the body found in the DiLaurentis backyard 2 years ago.
and this announcement is right on the heels of the more recent murder of Alison's mother Jessica DiLaurentis.
as these are not the only murders...
are they together now?
have you been drinking again?
I had one sip of beer.
woman: Oh, here he comes, we're going live.
we take you now to the Rosewood police chief.
police CHIEF: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I've called this press conference because we received confirmation tonight was Bethany Young.
she was a 17-year-old patient at the Radley Institution that Alison DiLaurentis was allegedly kidnapped.
did they just say "allegedly"?
the victim's parents have been notified to grieve over the loss of their loved one.
there will be no comments and no questions...
Oh, my God!
CALEB: What the hell was that?!
Ali: Are you okay?
guys, what just happened?
Oh, my God.
my God.
...your house.
was there anyone in there?
Toby, stay here! Please!
man: That's the last box.
welcome home.
DISPATCHER: All units in the vicinity,
please respond to an explosion at 47 Serenity Lane.
ambulances and paramedics are en route.
how do I know that girl Vince is talkin' to?
that's Sasha Grey. - The porn star?!
former colleague Lizzie Grant is trying to take clients. Who's she working for?
Vince isn't gonna be the face of some Tequila company. He's not aunt Jemima.
I read a script this morning. I want to do it. - Okay.
stamos sent it to me. - Jesus.
this is awkward. I happened to see your search history on the computer.
can we talk about this tonight?
I might be hiding from you tonight.
I want Saget. I wish I could've done more.
what's up, Vince? - This Tequila's special. I want to involved.
this is Sasha. - This is the man, the myth, the legend... Stan Lee.
Oh, you look familiar. - How'd the meeting go?
not great. Vince brought Sasha and apparently he was drunk.
good evening, Ari. - Please don't tell me you're the one who picked up the stray Lizzie.
anyone she wants, I'm going after.
well, she's going after you too, Ari.
I'm going to make your life miserable like you once made mine.
good night, Ari.
tell us, Vince, what are we doing here?
we're having our own private launch party for our new Tequila company.
name, Vin. Give 'em the name.
uh, Tequila Avion.
Huh-uh, Avion. - Avion!
and who is this?
this is my friend Sasha.
aren't we more than friends by now?
Oh no no, we are. We're very good friends.
and this is my friend. - Alex.
notice how she didn't say we're more than friends?
you don't make a move soon, Turtle, I'm gonna have to.
what, am I not here? - I'm just saying.
he's made moves. We're just taking it slow.
real slow. Like the 405 at rush hour. Ow.
well, Alex, all I know is I've had a lot of sex in my life and the best sex I've ever had was while drinking this.
can we quote international star of stage and screen Sasha Grey on that?
I'm not shy. Drink this and you'll have the best sex of your life.
guys can fuck like me and girls can fuck like a porn star.
come on, Vince.
that was awesome.
Oh my God.
so what is the deal? Are you two gonna bang or what?
Jesus, Drama. I thought you were dead.
no, I'm just unemployed, sad and lonely.
don't worry, I'm saving a piece of my piece of this company for you.
that makes me feel much better.
say something on camera about it. You're a pseudo-celeb.
I don't drink Tequila. I drink Johnny blue 'cause I'm not a pseudo-man like you.
all right, you're out. - I am out.
doesn't drink Tequila. Huh, what a loser.
what?
I was gonna kiss you.
you've already kissed me. - Fine, then I won't.
Why? Why do you like teasing me so much?
I told you, I'm not that easy.
no, you're like breaking into Fort Knox.
then I guess you'd better keep trying.
okay, so what are we looking at here?
well, sexual harassment maybe. Wrongful termination possibly.
I didn't terminate her. She quit.
she felt that she was overlooked for a promotion she deserved.
I would have given it to her.
whose side are you on? I didn't do anything wrong here.
obviously Amanda Daniels disagrees.
why would she be willing to spend her money supporting Lizzie?
to get back at me. - For what?
he stopped her from getting a job she wanted once upon a time also.
there is no case here.
you say Lizzie's written down things you've said?
Yes, in a journal. - Yeah, made-up words obviously.
obviously. - Look, it's her word against mine, right?
they'll subpoena everyone in this office. What might they say?
what do you think they might say?
he told me I'd look good with a ball gag in my mouth last week.
yes? - What would you say about my treatment of you over the last five years?
treatment? - This is Jim Lefkowitz, Lloyd.
our attorney. - Attorney?
what's going on? - The lovely Lizzie Grant may sue me.
and you, Lloyd, and everyone who works here may be asked to describe how Ari treats his employees. So what would you say?
Ari has always been gracious and lovely, fair and reasonable.
this has been a dreamlike job from minute one.
and would you say that if you were under oath, facing a perjury charge and possible jail time?
Oh God, I can't do time, Ari. I don't think anybody in my family could.
I'm sorry. - Go!
so do you think others would speak better of him?
worse is my guess.
what do you suggest?
well, I mean, you're trying to bring an N. F. L. team to Los Angeles.
so? - So the N. F.L. doesn't like controversy.
this goes to trial, win or lose, that's over. You know that.
and your wife and kids won't like it either.
I haven't done anything wrong.
Jim, what do you suggest? - I suggest you offer Ms. Grant a generous amount of money to not pursue legal action.
I already offered her a generous severance package.
I'm offering her nothing else.
I'll call her new boss and convince her not to waste her time or her money on this thing.
just make sure she doesn't write down everything you say.
she's right. - Jake!
get Amanda Daniels on the phone.
morning, E. - Morning.
late night? You look tired.
I was up till 10: 00 tasting wedding cakes.
I'm not tired, I'm nauseous.
any sign of an offer for Vince? - Mm-hmm.
how is it? - Oh, I didn't look.
okay, it's incredible.
Wow. Scott! - Oh, and a Billy Walsh called.
Oh, come on. - Yeah, why, who is he?
he was supposed to be a big director for a minute. Never heard of him?
shall I call him back? - No, but call Ari.
tell him I want to talk to him about this. Thank you.
Yes, Murray, I know.
Yes, Murray, I know. Eric's here, he says hello.
Hi, Murray. - He says hi, yeah.
okay, I love you. I really do. Have a good trip.
have fun. Okay, bye. I hate myself. - What's the problem?
he wants me to babysit his house. - He's got a nice house.
he also has two pugs that do nothing but snore and shit.
don't worry about that. Look at this. - What is it?
Vince's offer for "air-walker.
back end? - Huge, and 12 upfront.
holy shit!
I have Billy Walsh again.
tell him I'm out of town or something like that.
did you call Ari? - I left word with his assistant.
call him back, tell him we're heading down there.
we are? - Yes. You can be my eyewitness that he had absolutely nothing to do with this.
I can do that.
Johnny, you've got to stop drinking.
Why? - 'Cause you've been going for 16 straight hours.
so have you. - Yeah, but I'm happy drinking.
I'm gonna keep doing it until I get a job.
maybe you should do a play.
I'd love to, bro, but I can't afford it.
my mortgage rate's ready to reset.
whatever movie I do next I'm making sure there's a role in it for you.
Vince... - And I got your mortgage until you find a job.
and that will be pretty soon I'm sure.
how do you know, bro? I was on a series six months ago.
I haven't had an offer since. Correction...
dos equis asked me to be the least interesting man in the world.
Johnny, this town is up and down, up and down.
you know that. I mean, look at me.
I was done, but I came back.
and you will too. - I hope so, bro.
but for now, let me wallow in my misery.
stop wallowing with my Tequila.
I'm gonna run out of samples. - Boo. What, are you in a bad mood too?
no, why? - You look sad.
I guess he couldn't close Alex.
it was looking pretty good to me.
I closed. I closed.
great, so how was it? - For me or for her?
we know it couldn't have been any good for her, so let's hear about you.
but first, have a drink.
it's 10: 00 A. M. - Suit yourself.
top me off, bro.
so what happened?
I really don't want to talk about this.
lighten up, Turtle. If it's any consolation, this moonshine of yours is starting to grow on me.
great. - Come on, tell us what happened.
I closed.
I did. I just didn't close well.
what, did you pop off early? It's been a long time for you.
Yeah, Turtle, that's no big deal.
no, it wasn't that. It just didn't start out so good and then I couldn't find my groove.
what, you didn't eat it right?
disaster. - I'm sure you're just imagining it.
no, I'm not. And the truth is I've been imagining it for a month.
she is so hot and then finally
I was all ready and I made my way down there and...
what? - Nothing.
something. - You guys are gonna laugh at me.
no we won't. - No no no.
okay, I made my way down there just as the sun came up.
the harsh light hit it directly and it was completely bald and I freaked.
Yeah, see?
I'm sorry. Why did you freak?
seriously, Turtle. I love that.
it's like you peel back the curtains to reveal the mystery of oz.
I don't have a problem with it.
it's just that close up with the sun, it shocked me.
what, you saw a shaved box before?
I have in porn. Just not in 3d.
I've been with girls who were nicely groomed... landing strip.
the landing strip went out in the mid 90s, bro.
it's the truth. Everyone goes smooth nowadays.
even you, I bet. - Smooth balls for sure.
and I hope you do yours as well.
I don't groom my dick, no. - Are you kidding?
it's 2010; You'd better.
do people really do this, Vin? - I only know about my own dick.
and, Turtle, you should only worry about yours.
but listen, you haven't been with many chicks since Jamie.
many meaning zero.
and you were nervous. So I'm sure you did fine.
no, I didn't. I need another shot.
well, I am sure you will get one. - I hope.
well, if you do, you'd better do a little courtesy manscaping.
can't have your dick looking like a chia pet, bro.
can I just get a little support? At least tell me I'm not crazy.
no, you're not crazy. Murray's hard on you.
people get into patterns in work relationships.
sometimes it's hard to get out of them. You'll see with Ari and I.
Why? How's that go? - Well, he's a dick.
better not be a dick to me. - Take it easy.
would it be so bad if I gave Ari Gold a smack in front of all his peers?
Hey, Eric, and...
I told your office now is not a good time. Ari is not in a great mood.
has that whore called me back yet? - Told you.
no, not yet.
I'm gonna cheer him up, Jake. - No, Eric, wait.
uh, Ari... - Hey, Ari.
what is this, the Big Brother program of America?
except who's the Big Brother? - This is Scott Lavin.
so? - I called you last week twice about Vince.
what are you two doing in my office when you don't have a meeting on the books?
is he kidding? - We're here for Vince.
Vince. You remember Vince?
he doesn't play in the N. F.L. but he still makes a good amount of money.
who the fuck are you and why am I wasting my time listening to you?
e, I got a lot on my plate. Speak fast.
we got a big offer for Vince.
could be worth $100 million over three movies.
look, now he's paying attention. - Scott.
Randall Wallace? - And Stan Lee.
why don't I know about this? - 'Cause you don't call anybody back.
I'll call Vince myself. - Don't do that.
truth is we got this done without you but we obviously care about your opinion.
thank you, I appreciate it. The truth is I've been a little under it lately.
N. F.L? - Personal stuff.
Oh wow. Everything okay with the family?
Yeah, thanks. - Amanda Daniels.
I've got to take this. - She's on her way up.
she's on her way up? - Uh-huh.
what are you doing with Amanda? - Nothing.
you hitting that?
look, you guys got to go. This is really important.
I will call you as soon as I go over this very thoroughly.
he is hitting that. - Listen, e, I'll call you in an hour.
make sure that your dopplegang-banger stays off the line. Go!
Hello, Amanda. - Hello, Eric.
get the fuck out. - Don't ever touch me again, you fucking jerk off.
what are you doing here, Amanda?
you called and I thought you might threaten me to my face.
no one wants to threaten you, okay? - Then what do you want?
I just simply want to know if you really want to burn every last dollar that you have trying to slander my name.
slander? - Mm-hmm.
no, I read Lizzie's journals.
there's some pretty horrific stuff in there, even for you.
why are you doing this? - Because once upon a time you walked into my office and you took a job away from me that I deserved simply because you could.
so it's about payback? - No no, this is like arms control.
see, you're like Iran and I need to take away your weapons because you're reckless.
you're smart enough to know it's only a matter of time before I scoop up one of your castoffs and sue you right back.
unlike you,
I had the foresight to work Lizzie for a while.
so I have proof, you'd only have hearsay.
Lizzie's little work-of-fiction journal proves that I'm guilty like Lindsay "blow-han" proves that fame is fucking healthy.
she has recordings of you too.
your voice. - Bullshit.
Oh, it's true. The tapes are so clear it sounds like they were professionally recorded.
you heard them? - I listened to them, yeah, the last three nights and played with myself while fantasizing about fucking you in the ass.
anything else you wanted to say? I freed up my afternoon.
you follow through on this and you're starting a war.
then man up, Ari, because I love to battle.
it's funny, you know.
this was actually less hostile than I expected.
so Vince has been tweeting the shit out of the Tequila.
Oh yeah? - Yeah.
said he started a new company. - That's great.
I was thinking of posting some of the videos.
the cool ones, not the silly ones. - Yeah.
totally.
good.
cool.
better than last night.
what? - I'm kidding.
no you weren't. - Come on, it was awkward.
you think? - I think maybe we just did it too soon.
or maybe we shouldn't have done it at all.
no no no, of course we should have done it.
it was my fault. It was me.
I take full responsibility. - For what?
for the awkwardness. - What happened?
we were having a great time and then the second the clothes came off you turned into a clumsy mute.
I wasn't feeling great.
I don't know, Turtle. Maybe we're just not meant to be like that.
I mean, Sasha said she had the best sex of her life on our Tequila.
I thought it was the worst.
it wasn't the worst.
okay, you've got to give me another shot.
maybe we're just meant to be business partners.
no no no, come on. I will wine you and dine you and woo you and I will blow your mind in bed.
you think?
let me try.
okay.
you can try.
excuse me. Can I have some ketchup, please?
hello. - Hi.
Hi, I'm William Walsh. I'm an old friend of Vince's.
I'm Sasha, a new friend of Vince's.
Billy Walsh. Oh my God.
Vince, how are you? It's been a while.
I'll say. Come here. How are you?
I'm okay. - Hey, Sash, this is Billy Walsh, - an amazing filmmaker. - That's kind of you to say.
I thought you looked familiar, but different.
I've been through a lot and back again.
can I come in? - Of course, of course.
Hey, Johnny, look who's here.
jeez, Billy Walsh. It's like a mirage.
how are you, Drama? - Peachy, Billy.
I'm getting jerked off by the network 'cause nobody can find a idea for me.
you got one?
not off the top of my head, no.
superb.
you seem angry, Drama.
I've always been, Billy. Only now I'm drunk too.
I shot a movie with you. - Yeah, uh...
you know, maybe this wasn't the best place for me to come.
porn stars, alcohol, manic depressives...
I've avoided all temptation for the last 24 months now.
so what are you doing here, Billy?
I came to get back into the business I left behind.
Vince isn't gonna make another stinker with you, Billy, if that's what you're thinking.
no, Vince isn't what I need at this point. - So what do you need?
Vince needs to get rid of Ari.
enough already. - I'm being serious.
I mean, the guy is barely even in the business anymore.
what do you think is gonna happen when he's standing on an N. F.L. sideline spending all his time trying to bang cheerleaders?
look, Ari's got a big mouth but he's done a lot by us.
and he's obviously got some serious stuff going on.
so does Vince and he needs someone who's gonna be on the ball.
are you telling me you can't handle an offer?
you can't make sure he's paid? Make sure he has a nice trailer?
Ari and Vince's attorneys handle the little details.
we can take it to his attorney. We can handle the details.
if Ari's so stressed out maybe he'd appreciate you taking the reins on this one.
come on, aren't you tired of being a pushover?
who's a pushover? - We both are.
we handled this thing for Vince.
we're basically the ones keeping this company afloat.
so now you're back to Murray? - Of course I'm back to Murray.
we do all the work. I mean, the guy is literally never here.
I wouldn't say never. - You wouldn't say never?
Murray! Hey, Murray!
anyone seen Murray, ever? - Are you on drugs?
no, I'm fucking angry, as you should be too.
about what, Murray or Ari? - About both of them.
they are checking out, okay? We cannot.
this is our future, all right?
you saw how we handled this deal with Vince.
you saw how we handled Ari.
we can run Vince and this company without either one of them.
you do realize that I'm marrying Murray's god-daughter, right?
the one who got me this job. - Family before business, I get it.
but you and Sloan are about to start your own family so you need to start...
shauna's on the phone and she's freaking out. - Who isn't?
she says that Vince tweeted that he started some Tequila company and Turtle posted some racy videos about it.
awesome.
no, I did not know that Vince was dating a porn star, Shauna.
no, I didn't know he started his own Tequila company either.
I have to go.
Lizzie Grant. I didn't know that you ate here.
well, I know you don't eat here 'cause you don't like, and I'm quoting, "eating with all the pussy-ass bitch agents.
you know what? I have grown to love my own kind.
are you following me? - You can't prove it.
you would be amazed at what I could prove.
I talked to your boss. - I'm aware.
Yeah, she may use nicer words but she's a much worse person than me.
anyone in this town could tell you that.
that is so funny because she swears you're the worst person she's ever dealt with.
stealing clients... - Have you ever seen me steal clients?
Ari, I have no interest in talking to you.
well, I have an interest in you not sullying my name.
so tell me what you want.
what I want? - Yes.
how much money to settle so we don't end up in court where you will lose?
a writer's assistant on a sitcom once sued for inappropriate talk.
it went to the supreme court. You know what they told her?
they told her that the writers can talk about gang-banging her all day long as long as they don't do it.
I know the case. They're creative.
you're certainly not. So you can talk about gang-banging all day, but you're the only one who's gonna get fucked.
100, 000. - No.
250. - How about 10 million?
don't be absurd. - You think I'm being absurd?
I think that you're whoring yourself out to a witch of a woman who is trying to get you to slander a good family man's name.
$1 million not to sue.
Ari, I cannot tell you how good it makes me feel to watch you squirm.
but you can rest easy, 'cause I've already told Amanda that I'm not gonna sue you. So keep your money.
you're not? - No.
I will make my money because I'm smart and I'm talented, not because you're repugnant.
I think you're doing the right thing, because no one needs to hear about our past.
no, that's where you're wrong.
everyone needs to hear.
I want the women of the world to know how you treat them.
what does that mean?
check "deadline Hollywood.
I'm sure the story should be posted sometime soon, unless you can buy them off.
you sent tapes of me to "deadline Hollywood"?
is that even legal?
sue me.
I thought you wanted to conserve your product.
I want to relax. - You freaking about tonight?
I'm not freaking, I'm just on edge a little.
let me tell you, shoving that poison down your throat is not the remedy.
poison? This is 100% pure agave.
the only remedy for you is storming the hairless beaches.
you're gonna be fine, Turtle.
I don't normally have performance issues.
Yeah, you perform as often as led zeppelin.
you should probably take a cab. Or I can drive you.
you should take a cab.
I like you two as my parents.
Hey, Vin, where's the can? - To the left.
yo, Turtle, you want a Cialis?
no. Maybe.
Hi, I need a cab for 3750 longo.
Johnny, why do you carry around Cialis?
in case I really got to bury one.
you should use kaboom. You get a bigger bang. - Good tip.
e, to what do we owe this pleasure?
turtle posted a video of you and Sasha on Twitter.
I just got reamed out by Shauna.
that was unintentional. I edited smaller parts.
I just accidentally uploaded the whole thing. - I thought it was cute.
a movie star telling guys to fuck like him and girls to fuck like a porn star isn't cute, Vince.
I said that? - Yes.
you did. - I'm sure the way I said it was very charming.
turtle, what happened? I thought the Tequila company was gonna be on the down low.
no, it only went out to my Twitter followers.
you have a million and a half followers. - I do?
Yeah, now T. M.Z. Perez Hilton and just Jared all want to know if Sasha's your girlfriend.
well, tell them she is.
I thought we were just really good friends.
look, Vince, you just got the biggest offer of your career today, all right?
I just want to make sure you're focused. - I'm focused.
I'm focused. Aren't I focused? - Seems focused to me.
you see? So how was the offer? Was it good?
Yeah, it's great. Ari's looking it over right now.
all right. Well, things are happening.
no kidding. Check out this B. B. M. I got today.
e, I've tried you several times at the office.
I would love it if you could see yourself giving me five minutes of your time.
technology is amazing. - What's amazing is that somebody gave this clown my B. B. M. Address.
Hey, suit. Long time.
do you want Jerry Jones?
and you still haven't called back Jeff Katzenberg or Mike Meldman or Tracy Morgan.
I don't want to talk to anybody. Was I not clear?
nobody! I don't care if Justin Bieber calls and wants me to negotiate the rights to his virginity.
I don't want to talk to him. Nobody!
uh, your wife is here.
Hello, Mrs. gold. Ari doesn't wish to speak... - Hello.
get the fuck out of the way. - Oh, I'm sorry.
you shouldn't talk to your assistants like that. - I know, I'm sorry.
what are you doing here? - I told you I was coming by with the swatches so that we could redo your office.
Oh. - You forgot.
no, I... - Okay, what do you think of this one?
like it. - You didn't even look.
no no, I glanced.
baby, I got quick eyeballs. U know that.
and I trust your taste. You have amazing taste.
and I love that. - I'd like you to be involved.
Why? - It would give us something that we could do together.
something we could do... we do everything together.
no, not anymore we don't. - What do you mean?
since the merger. - What since the merger?
I don't feel good. - Why?
because you're never home. Now with this N. F.L. thing...
that may not happen. - Why not?
it may not happen. - Why not? What's happening?
nothing.
I feel like you've been keeping a lot of secrets lately.
honey, no. Listen, let's go to an early dinner, just the two of us. We'll talk about everything. All right?
I'm sorry, Ari. Dana Gordon's on the line. Says it's urgent about Vince.
I'll call you in an hour, take you to Madeo.
just you and me, okay? - Okay.
put her through.
Dana, is this really important?
if Vince is really gonna carry this studio's next franchise, I'd say it is.
does that feel good?
amazing.
I told you I could do this. - Yeah you can.
you're incredible. - Shh.
sorry if I caused you any stress.
it's okay.
I just thought it was your first time.
first time what?
you know, having sex.
are you serious?
it's okay if it was. - I'm 30.
I'm just saying.
you really think I'm some ugly loser, huh?
I didn't say that. - No, but the first time I tried to kiss you you looked at me like I was a venereal disease. I'm cute.
you are, Turtle, and I didn't see it at first.
but I see it now. - Good.
but something was up last night.
just let it go. - Was it me?
no no, are you crazy?
just tell me what it was. - I'm immature.
what do you mean?
I've never been with a girl before who was totally shaved down there.
it freaked me out. - Wow.
Yeah. - You are immature.
I know. I had dreams all night about playing pac-man.
Pac-man? - You know, pac-man.
Oh my God. Is that why you shaved too?
Yeah, why? You don't like it?
no, I don't like it.
guys are supposed to trim, not go totally bald.
Thanks, Drama. So did I totally just fuck this up again?
no, it'll grow back.
I really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me.
I didn't have much choice, Billy.
we all have choices and I've made some bad ones.
Yeah. What can I do for you, Billy?
I need you to help guide me out of the toilet like you did Vince.
why would you want me? - Because, man, you were the first guy to believe in me.
you found my first script, you got me Vince, you got us the money. And as much as I was hard on you,
I always knew you were the guy with the good eye.
we can't work together, Billy. - Why not?
because there's too much baggage and past.
pretend we've never met. - How could I do that?
well, essentially we haven't. I don't drink anymore.
I don't do drugs. I don't curse. - You don't curse?
no, I've spent the last three years becoming an ordained minister in Santa fe.
got myself right and I want to work.
you want Vince?
I want you to help me.
I'll do anything... commercials, tv, anything.
I've changed.
still got that Pablo Escobar tattoo on your back?
no, I had it scraped off with a bowie knife in a ritual smokehouse ceremony.
no, it's still there. Some things haven't changed.
but I've got a family now. - Oh, you have a kid?
I've got four. - Four?
set of Irish twins, set of actual twins and another one on the way.
I thought we could live on love, but tiny kids can't eat love.
look, Billy, I'm gonna have to think about this.
you know, Drama was telling me about this network deal that he's got.
Yeah, if you have any ideas, don't be afraid to shoot them my way.
actually, I was already thinking like maybe he's not having any luck because he's too ugly to star in his own show.
Yeah, you've changed, Billy. - Come on, don't be mad. I'm serious.
look, he doesn't have the face for the screen but he's got the voice.
so what, you think he should do radio? - No, I was thinking a cartoon.
cartoon? - Yeah, like"the simpsons" but angrier.
e, Ari's here and he's being a douche.
you hear that voice? How distinct and angry it is?
were you talking about me?
what's Ari want, Drama? - He wants to talk to you.
I got a lot of ideas. - Sit tight, Billy.
Jesus, Billy, you're back and apparently working at the gap.
Hey, Ari. - He needs representation, Ari.
so does Vince. - Yes, he does. Did you decide to start doing your job again?
I close my eyes for one minute and he's dating porn stars - and starting a Tequila company? - Look, Ari...
you look. I need to talk to him. My wife's in the car.
she's ready to shoot me so I've got to talk fast.
I already spoke to Shauna. - Well, I talked to Dana and the director and they're freaking out.
how could you let this guy show up drunk and with a porn star to a meeting?
he took a Vicodin, Ari. And I didn't let him.
how is he doing now? - He's fine.
the studio wants to sit down with him to make sure that he is.
Jesus.
look, is this thing real, the relationship with the porn star?
what? No. - You sure?
Ari, Vince is fine.
where is he? I want to talk to him. - He's out by the pool.
Oh, hey, guys. - Jesus.
Vince, wake up. You have more visitors.
wake up. - Yeah, he looks fine.
do you know what's missing?
cash from the register and the sketches for my new line.
I don't trust you or like you.
so how about you stay out of my bed
and stay away from Marvin?
you need to convince Lucas to do the movie.
and you'll make it the movie he wants it to be.
Absolutely.
Hey, Nate.
I'm happy to be a part of it, man.
what's that?
the comeback.
don't call it a comeback, man.
a little old man and I fell out.
I'll tell you what it was all about.
he had money, and I had none,
and that's the way the noise begun.
sure?
Yep. 74 inches, daddy.
I can measure again. - No.
it's okay. I've been 6'2" since I was 17.
is that bad?
well, if I was 6'5," I might be in the pros by now.
what if you were 8'5"?
I'd probably be dead of heart failure.
well, I think 6'2" is perfect.
heck, I'd settle for 4'2."
well, you can thank your short-pants mom for that. - Hey!
he got some good stuff from me,
like the piano he's gonna rock at the talent show tonight, huh?
Yeah. - Are you gonna be there, daddy?
I wouldn't miss it.
I wish I could come with you today. - I know.
I tell you what ... I'll tell you all about it, okay?
and this idea you have?
it's what you want to do?
it's what I have to do.
Sam! Breakfast!
Hi.
he spent the night in your bed?
in my house?!
well, I thought it was about time a guy stayed here.
watch yourself.
look, he's my friend, and he lives with his brother. And he just ...
he beats on him sometimes, and he needed a place to crash.
okay.
does this half-nude, window-fleeing friend have a name?
John "Jack" Daniels.
you expect me to believe that a boy named after the white-trash-rock-band drink of choice
spent the night in your bed and nothing happened?
dude, I'm like 15.
like that matters! When I was 15 ...
never mind.
tell me when someone is staying in my house,
and if your friend needs a place to "crash" again,
he can sleep on the couch!
now just go do something.
Hi, Luke.
I'll stay on the movie...
because it matters to me.
but you and I are not friends,
and you and Peyton aren't anything.
how is our girl Peyton?
and how long have you been experiencing this pain?
a few days.
any history of diabetes in the family? Ulcers?
Um...no.
cancer?
my birth mother died of cancer. Why?
what ... what's the face that you're making?
we just want to run some tests.
consider it a test.
you fly to Los Angeles, and while you're gone,
if Peyton doesn't fall in love with me again,
then you'll know you two were meant to be.
you're a dick. You know that?
listen, the truth is, this guy's an a-list director.
he's got several offers, and you need to meet with him.
today? Why?
because I told you we'd be equal partners on this movie,
and I need you to sign off on him.
what are you gonna do?
I'm producing a movie, Luke.
contrary to popular belief, I'm not staying in town to hit on your fiancy.
it's your book.
what?
you just froze there, halfway out the window.
you looked like such a dork.
well, you're the one who didn't set the alarm right.
whatever. She thought we were doing it.
as if.
what do you mean, "as if"?
a lot of girls would do it with me.
Yeah.
but those girls are called prostitutes.
Why?
Hi.
producer guy, right?
orphan girl, right? From the concert?
I know.
you can help me.
good. You can help me, too.
so, what happens at this what do you call it?
it's called a combine.
coaches and scouts from the pro teams come watch you play.
and they pick you for the NBA?
you find them yet? - No.
Hey, I think you should wear the number 12 next.
Why?
I don't know. I like the number 12.
that's what I'm gonna wear when I'm in the pros.
all right. - Okay, I found them.
Oh, good.
these are really ugly, dad.
well, they made a few models, so just pick one you like, you knucklehead.
okay.
so, your mom's pretty excited sbout you playing the piano at your talent show tonight.
I know.
you don't sound very pumped up.
I just kind of wanted to tell jokes.
dude, I've heard your jokes.
trust me, stick with the piano.
but the song is a kiddy song, and I'm not very good at it.
well, all you can do is the best you can, all right?
that's all that matters.
speaking of which, are you telling me you can't find those shoes by now?
Oh, I found the shoes a long time ago. I just like it up here.
we found the shoes.
Yay!
all set?
Yeah.
all right.
see you at the talent show. - Go be great.
love you.
love you.
daddy.
all you can do is your best, okay?
you want some coffee with that sugar?
how do you take yours?
I don't. Never touch the stuff.
so, you said I could help you out. How so?
I was thinking, um,
maybe you could read some of the stuff I wrote.
you're a screen writer?
I just write things. I get a little pissed off sometimes, you know?
okay. Tell me about Brooke Davis.
dude, I am so not hooking you two up.
no, no, her clothing line. Is she any good?
Yeah. Think you'd be lucky to have her.
for the movie, right? That's why you're asking?
give me your phone.
this is my number.
I'm happy to read anything you want to send me.
you'd do that?
I mean, I just kind of heard you're a dick.
I am. But maybe I'll read something I can steal.
I got this.
Hey, is she single ...Brooke?
no.
Yeah.
you know, I'm betting you're actually nice.
and I'm betting you're not bitter.
keep writing, Sam.
she's out of your league, my brother.
I told Gigi to stay away from Marvin, and the next thing I know,
she's hugging him in the parking lot.
what were you doing in the parking lot?
spying.
well, what am I supposed to do? She's a horny college party girl.
Millie, he's amused by her.
so, I don't want a guy who's amused by someone like that.
okay.
I know those girls...
because I've been those girls.
and all guys are amused by it.
it doesn't mean anything. Mouth is not gonna fall for that.
he's not.
trust me, she's harmless.
you ever think about having sex on the news desk?
no.
maybe. What are you doing?
well, the news team is on location, so Chris said I could have my going-away party in here tonight.
6: 30 okay?
actually, I have to go to Jamie's talent show.
I'm totally not having my going-away party without you.
please.
one drink. I wouldn't miss it.
you're gonna have to miss it.
Peyton, come on!
you have to get back into the studio.
Mia, I'm being very serious, okay?
I'm so proud of you, and the first record did great.
but our label friend, John, who I do not have a thing for,
is getting very impatient for the next one,
so just tell me that you have been working on the demos I asked you to do.
Peyton, I've had a lot going on.
okay, fine.
how many songs do you have?
I have a couple ideas.
all right.
the label would like for you to listen to this.
what for?
because there are some very talented, very expensive songwriters on there,
and they want you to pick a track to record.
but I write my own songs. - Apparently not.
apparently, you just write a couple ideas.
Hello? Hi.
Oh, Luke. Hi, honey. I'm sorry.
no, no, no, I was just expecting another call.
Yeah. No, I had to leave really early this morning.
um, I had a ... like a meeting with a band.
can you hold on one second? Okay.
please, just listen to that.
Hi, okay. Sorry.
l. A? Why are you going to L. A.?
name and affiliation?
Nathan Scott, university of Maryland.
professional affiliation.
who invited you to the combine?
no one did, sir.
these are professional trials, son ... invitation only.
I understand that.
look, I was an all-American at Maryland last season,
and I was just hoping that...
look, this is kind of my last shot.
didn't you get thrown through a window?
please.
I'm sorry. You can't be here.
he's with us.
better go suit up.
Oh, well "Breakfast club." You were the priss.
let me guess. You were the stoner?
well, if you say so. They end up together.
can I help you?
you should design the wardrobe for the movie.
I'm not a costume designer.
Oh. I can see that.
I'm starting a new line.
well, okay, let me try this again.
you should design the wardrobe for the movie.
you were there, it's authentic, it's press-worthy, and I would be lucky to have you before the debut of your new line,
which I'm sure is going to be fabulous.
sorry.
Hello?
Yes, this is me.
it is too me.
Oh, listen, I'm with Brooke right now.
no, I'm not gonna blow it.
no, I am not. No, I'm not.
sorry. Sam says hi.
Sam? My sam?
and why does my Sam have your phone number?
she has an interest in the film industry.
she is 15, you pervert.
okay, just wrap your head around it, okay?
you and the movie, I mean. Not me and Sam. She's only 15, you know.
you pervert.
Hey, man, whose shoes are those?
mine.
I know that, but I'm saying, who else shoes are they?
I heard what you asked.
I meant what I said. They're mine.
whatever you say, baller.
kid got his own shoe contract, But he's still trying out for the big league.
don't matter none, anyhow.
ain't nobody gonna give no roster spot to no fool with no green elf shoes on.
Hey, man, let me see those things, riddler.
37 inches.
get a close enough look?
shame how you've let yourself go, Nate.
you were kind of skanky, weren't you?
what?
in high school. You acted all weird this morning
because you were totally having sex at 15.
I was not.
you were, too. Is that where "clothes over bros" came from?
tired of being the dirty girl? 'Cause you're a bit of a prude now.
first of all, shut it.
second of all, if I have been a little frigid lately...
...It's probably because I was attacked at my store...
not long before you moved in,
and it's made me a little closed off ...
especially with boys.
Oh, my god. Brooke, did he ... - No.
no
but I've been really angry about it,
and I have a whole another set of issues with Owen.
and I'm...
trying to let it all go, and I just wanted you to know.
because I just want you to know.
okay?
okay.
and, yeah...
for the record, I was pretty slutty in high school.
and I wish I wouldn't have been, beause you don't get to take any of that back.
I like talking to you.
Thanks, Sam. I like talking to you, too.
excuse me!
excuse me!
Hi.
uh, I'm ...
and in that moment, he realized it's not what you are or who you are,
but who they allow you to be.
that is good writing.
really good writing!
I love this script.
love it!
I don't want to come out.
come on, buddy. I want to see you.
no, I look like a tool.
you look so awesome!
I look like a penguin.
you look cute! Now come over here, and we will go over this song again.
little tie!
looks so cute.
sorry, I always mess that up. - It's okay.
you nervous? - A little.
Yeah, you definitely get that from me.
I wonder how daddy's doing.
I remember now. You played at maryland, right?
got into a scrape right before the draft.
man, you that fool.
you hear that?
point guard!
thank you, god and my mama.
Nathan Scott, ladies and gentlemen.
Ooh, 6'2" shooting guard.
are there any scouts out here for the ymca rec league?
all right, all right.
gentlemen, we're gonna divide you up into groups and let you play.
point guards on my right. Two-Guards on my left.
forwards and centers, other end of the court.
show us what you got.
let's go, fellas.
Two-Guards over here.
I'm trying out as a point guard.
okay. But you ever played the point?
well, I've never played point guard in my life.
you better learn, beause you're too short to play the two in the pros.
bro, you 6'2."
and I was also 12 hours away from being an NBA lottery pick, you idiot.
well, I'm glad you had the accident, beause you sure wouldn't have made it.
you got to move to the point. -You're out of your mind!
you realize nobody's ever told me this before?
well, I'm telling you now, all right?
and anyways, man, they all get their commission when you sign.
ain't like nobody gonna risk their 10% by telling you the truth.
now, look, Nate.
yo, if you can make it by playing against tall guys at the two, man, all good.
but if you can't, we work on your handle,
we work on your quickness, and we make damn sure
you got the best shot of playing pro ball.
why are you doing this for me, q?
this ain't just your dream, man.
let's work on that left.
numbers are funny.
they can measure you, time you, analyze you all they want,
but they all know what really matters is how you play the game.
he think I've lost a step because of my accident,
so he's gonna play me tight.
I haven't.
now he'll back off because he doesn't want to get beat off the dribble.
just a half step.
that's a mistake.
you ever heard the expression "they can't measure heart"?
well, the truth is, they can't measure any of it ...
heart, want, need.
they think I can't play point guard.
but q knew I could.
you can't measure a dream.
mouth, you made it.
here, you better catch up.
you're like the devil. You know that?
no, just devilish.
what's that?
just a little going-away present.
Oh, it's the t-shirt I slept in
after I thew up and passed out in your bed.
Oh, it's so sweet.
you never told me how you got me into this t-Shirt, Mouth.
maybe sometime you can get me out of it.
is this your first script?
Yeah.
don't worry. I'll fix i...
uh, is there something wrong with it?
no.
I love it.
I said I love it, and I love it.
a couple thoughts, that's all.
okay, like what?
all right, clear your head, all right?
what if Haley...
dies?
you're serious? - I'm saying think about it.
people love that stuff. Man, Dicaprio died in "titanic.
that is gold, baby, gold!
Yes, but it didn't happen.
it doesn't matter. Let me ask you this. Who goes to see this movie?
the same little bitches who went and saw "titanic.
young girls, man.
they don't have a voice,
but when they find something that speaks to them,
we're talking box office, baby! You're king of the world!
even so,
Haley can't just die.
you got a vision.
I can respect that.
what about this?
what if Lucas and Haley get married?
I'm serious about this one, beause if there's one thing that I know,
it's that audiences get crazy over who ends up together.
it's what I do, Luke.
it's what I know.
think about it.
I thought about it.
and I'm not interested.
you couldn't have told me that over the phone?
well, that, yeah, but the rest of this I wanted to say to your face.
I don't trust you...
not with Peyton, and definitely not with Sam.
and that is not gonna get you anywhere ... the grin.
I'm sure it's gotten you in a lot of doors and in a lot of beds,
but it's not gonna do you any good with me.
listen, brooke, when I make a movie,
I set the bar as high as I possibly can.
I put together my wish-list cast, my wish-list crew, my wish-list designer,
and sometimes, you know, the timing works out, the material works out, and you get lucky.
sometimes you don't.
good luck with everything.
I didn't listen to it.
I write my own songs.
Mia, I am not in the best mood right now,
and so it is a very bad time for you to make some naive little stand.
you think I'm naive?
Peyton, I am not the same girl who left on tour last year, okay?
God, I hope that's not true, because I liked that girl.
as a matter of fact, I loved that girl.
Oh, really? Then what happened to protecting her?
what happened to telling the label to be patient, because my songs are gonna be great?
Oh, I've been doing that!
I have been doing that for months now!
but what happened to actually doing the work, Mia?
now, the label wants you to record this song because they care.
when they stop caring, that's when we have a problem.
well, I'm not gonna do it.
you are being so ungrateful! Do you understand?
I put my ass on the line for you every single day!
well, I put my ass on the line for you
every single night, Peyton.
okay? Literally.
did you see how short that skirt was that you put me in at the U.S.O. Show?
but I did it.
I've done everything you've asked me to do, but I am not gonna do this.
Hey.
I'm not sure you should be on this label anymore.
life's too short.
trust me.
man, Madison's really killing it.
I knew I should've told jokes.
seriously. You're hosed.
Hi. - Hey!
you smell like alcohol.
Really? - Yeah.
is it bad? - No.
do you have any with you?
no.
Hey! Look who we found!
Hey!
Hi, Mouth. -Hey, baby.
how did it go?
I did what my son told me to ... the best I could.
here he comes! - He looks so cute!
he's nervous.
Hi, my name is James Lucas Scott,
and I'm gonna play "the first noel.
he's just got to get past this first part, and he'll be good.
Oh, no.
this is awkward.
how's everyone doing tonight?
last week, my mom asked me how I liked going to school.
I told her, "not as much as I like coming home from it.
and seriously, what's with the cafeteria food?
I mean, I can't tell if kids are out sick from eating that stuff,
or we're actually eating the kids who are out sick.
take my hot lunch...please.
and now, the big finish.
something like that. What do you want from me? I'm 5.
thank you and good night!
should've gone to Jamie's talent show with Brooke.
you're kidding, right?
I like them. They're nice to me.
I think it's funny how you stole from Brooke Davis and called her a bitch, - And now you like her. - I was pissed off. So what?
What'd you say after she caught you shoplifting?
you said she was a rich bitch and someone should put her in her place.
so?
you said someone should put her in her place, Sam.
so, tell me again why Lucas has to end up with Peyton.
because they do.
because that's the story. Because that's what happened.
it's a movie! Got to raise the stakes.
kill off one of the younger characters.
Hello?
Hi, doctor. It's me.
well, what does that mean?
what's wrong?
after you caught me shoplifting,
I was with my friends,
and I said some terrible things about you.
okay.
Sam, what happened?
well ... - don't, please. Just don't.
but I didn't mean them. I didn't ...
I didn't mean any of it.
but...
Sam, I'm sorry. I don't understand.
the attack it was my fault.
bourbon is a good, honest drink, you know?
classier than whiskey.
less of a stick up its ass than Scotch.
I'm an alcoholic.
has Sam been in here tonight?
no. Why? What's wrong?
we had a ... a thing
and she left and I let her go and I shouldn't have.
it's okay. Here, have a seat.
no, I have to find her.
Brooke, come on, she's a teenager.
she's not even your teenager.
and what is that supposed to mean?
I'll let you two...
Julian, if she calls you ...
it's not my problem.
look...
I just mean it's not like she's gonna stay with you forever, right?
what is wrong with you?
I came here because I need your help.
but, I mean, you know Sam. She'll turn up.
no
it's different this time.
but with you, it's exactly the same.
Hey, brooke!
that's not fair.
I have to find her!
but I'll do it by myself, just like I always do.
don't call me anymore.
so, how about we rent a movie, and then we can ...
I was looking for the number for the pizza place.
Oh, no. No, no, Millie, it's not ...
it's not what it looks like?
this isn't a half-naked picture of your ex-girlfriend in one of your t-shirts?
she sent it to me tonight. It was a joke.
Millie, please. There is nothing going on between us, I swear.
I-I was gonna delete it. - But you didn't.
you know what?
you're an idiot.
Millie, don't go, please.
it doesn't mean anything.
you're wrong, Marvin.
it means everything.
how funny was your son tonight?
Oh, he was goofy, like his mom.
I think he was brave, like his dad.
so, what's next with our comeback?
well, what's next is the phone's gonna ring,
and the answer is either gonna be a yes or a no.
it's going to be a yes.
I hope so.
but if it's a no, then this is the end of it,
and I'm okay with that.
rough night, Millie?
horrible.
Yeah, me, too.
you know I haven't had a drink in over eight years?
tonight, that's gonna change.
I haven't had sex in over 22 years.
and tonight, that's gonna change.
thank you.
Hey. - Hey, any luck?
uh, no. Are you looking for her, too?
I'm not that guy, Brooke. I'm just getting coffee. Sorry.
excuse me. I'm looking for someone ...
a young girl that comes in here a lot.
she's kind of a skater, sarcastic.
let me guess.
her name is Sam, and she puts a lot of sugar in her coffee.
you've seen her?
no, but that cute guy that just left asked me the same exact thing.
Thanks.
and then he got worried, and he backed off just a half step.
so, what do you think I did?
pulled up for 3 ... nothing but net.
that's right.
you know, I'm proud of you, buddy.
you took something that would've beaten most people,
and you kept going with it.
you turned it into something great.
so did you, daddy.
all right, Chris Rock, I know you're still wired,
but it's time for bed.
how about a nursery rhyme?
okay.
but you're gonna have to read it.
you want an old-school, creepy one, or a new, good-for-you one?
old-school creepy. - Okay.
okay.
there...
There...Gentle.
a man of words and not of deeds
is like a garden full of weeds.
and when the weeds begin to grow,
it's like a garden full of snow.
and when the snow begins to fall,
it's like a bird upon the wall.
and when the bird away does fly,
it's like an eagle in the sky.
and when the sky begins to roar,
it's like a lion at the door.
Hi.
I have to tell you something.
and when the door begins to crack,
it's like a stick across your back.
and when your back begins to smart...
Hey. You okay?
...It's like a penknife in your heart.
Sam, this is my brother, "x.
have a nice night?
have a bad night?
and when your heart begins to bleed, "You're dead...
and dead...
Hey, guys!
guess he got away.
can baby shoes come out to play?
come on.
hands on your head, climb out.
I can't climb out if my hands are on my head.
just keep 'em where i can see 'em, man.
go 'head. Go 'head. Come on.
you high, popo?
Yeah, man.
catchin' morons makes me high.
take your shirt off by your collar and turn around.
whoo, would you look at that!
dude's got a weapon.
all right, you have the right to remain...stupid!
watch the gun.
anything you say will be completely incomprehensible.
seriously, man, careful!
seriously, man? Seriously?
does your mama know what you do?!
Aww...that's sweet.
your dad's proud. You made the local paper. --From my article.
give it a rest.
you read what he wrote in the margin?
our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.
he's not proud of me. He's proud of Jesus.
everything I do right is god's work.
everything I do wrong is my own damn fault.
cop with a sense of humor.
differential diagnosis.
guy's in the E. R. Bleeding on everybody.
drugs?
he's a cop.
good point. How about...drugs?
tox screen was clean.
he did, however, get hit by a bullet.
just mentioning it.
he was shot?
no, somebody threw it at him.
I'm thinking trauma. He's got bullet fragments lodged in his brain.
according to baby shoes, the cop was laughing before he got shot.
baby shoes?
guy who shot him. --Reliable witness.
his name is baby shoes. How bad can he be?
fragments are in the wrong part of the brain to cause euphoria.
so let's expand the search. Factor in the cough and the cloudy lungs.
why are we ignoring the elevated heart rate?--'Cause he's in shock.
what if the heart was already fast before he got shot?
you mean after the foot race?
he's giddy. Indicates a blockage of oxygen.
carbon monoxide gas would elevate the heart rate and cause coughing and impair neurological functions.
he got co poisoning outdoors?
Yeah.
all 'cause those bastards didn't ratify Kyoto.
or he got co poisoning indoors and moved outdoors before he'd inhaled enough to make him drop dead.
test his arterial blood gas. If his carboxy hemoglobin levels are higher than 15%, stick him in a hyperbaric chamber.
you go check the cop car for gas leaks or
if it was the cop car, his partner would be sick.
well, maybe she is she just doesn't have as good a sense of humor.
also check his personal cars, work, and home.
I'll check the precinct.
blood tests confirm you have low-level carbon monoxide poisoning.
we're putting you inside a high-pressure chamber to...
you don't really care, do you?
do you live near a gas supply?
uh, yeah, me.
after, like, a huge enchilada.
anything toxic you have at your home?
any paint solvents, anything unhygienic?
uh, no.
no, I keep a pretty clean home.
if you start having trouble breathing, you can press this button, and the chamber will decompress.
like this?
don't now. If you have trouble.
Ah, it's broken.
all right, well, if you have problems we'll push it for you.
muscle contracture.
how bad does it hurt?
not...not at all.
looks wild, though, huh?
your brain's not getting enough oxygen. You're losing motor function.
we should start this right away.
should I be scared?
no, you probably have a carbon monoxide leak in your place.
we have a guy there checking things out.
sounds okay.
how about the gas intake valve?
looks great.
it's down in the furnace room.
your system's fine.
if you had a carbon monoxide leak, half the force would be sick.
then why are you here?
I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
Yeah. I've, uh...I've got a disability.
these are speeding tickets.
a lot of emergencies.
he's feeling better now, but...you never know.
I'll see what we can do.
Where's your partner sit?
place is a cesspool, but I don't think I need to test for anything.
Nope, waste of time.
you know about the marijuana?
I've heard rumors since junior high.
the cop's acting high because he is high.
he's got--legionnaires' disease.
it's a good thing Joe got shot.
the whole precinct would have got wiped out. Anarchy on the streets.
takes 48 hours to test for legionnaire's.
and only two seconds to recognize if the symptoms fit while staring at the rancid, unchanged water of an ac unit.
marijuana explains the high carboxy, the cloudy lungs, and the happiness.
pot doesn't explain the fact that he's gotten worse since he was admitted.
why don't we agree to disagree?
actually, why don't we agree that you'll disagree with me while treating him for legionnaire's? It's not as pithy, but...
I feel a lot better. The meds are working.
heart rate's normal. Cohp levels are down. No fever.
take some deep breaths.
you seem disappointed.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
you got a problem with cops?
please don't talk.
in my experience, people who just don't like cops have a reason
I need you not to talk.
no rales.
these clouded areas of the upperobes...they're the infiltrates we found yesterday.
not there anymore?
they're clearing up. You had legionnaire's.
now you don't.
so you didn't, um...you didn't find anything at my place?
Nothing...medically relevant.
so there's, uh...there's nothing I need to worry about, then?
not this time.
whatcha doing?
I want to make sure he sees what's involved.
what we found was fairly advanced.
these cloudy areas here, and here.
these parts of your lungs simply weren't functioning.
they're okay now, right?
everything's okay now?
I'm fine.
you're blind.
I bumped into something. That doesn't mean I can't see.
I'm sure it's frightening, but you only think
what's dr. Cameron wearing?
dark blue pants, white shirt. Black shoes.
Ooh, almost.'Cept for the pants, shirt, and shoes. You're blind.
he really thinks he can see?
he can physically see. His brain just can't process it.
no chance this is a practical joke?
no way.
Anton's blindness indicates damage to both occipital lobes.
must be from the trauma.
bullet fragments just happen to hit the same spot in both lobes?
stroke could cause anton's blindness and euphoria.
office Krupke is clotting in his brain.
start heparin to thin the blood, find the clot, and yank it out.
clot would be at the top of the bilateral vertebral arteries.
great. Chase...stick your fingers in there, grope around till you find it.
Oh, wait...when you turn him into a vegetable, then there's gonna be frivolous lawsuits.
you know what would be better? Contrast MRI.
do we have one of those?
you can't do an MRI. If the bullet fragment's magnetic, they'll move and rip his brain apart.
well, let's flip a coin.
heads, MRI; tails, he dies.
the police issue Kevlar vests don't have the ceramic plate insert that would shatter a bullet, they would just catch it.
so the bullet shattered on its own.
meaning baby shoes was using 0.38 caliber hollow points.
which, unfortunately, are ferromagnetic.
it's just so cool that you know that.
we could do an angio to find the clotting.
waste of time. The skull creates too much artifact. We'll never get a decent view.
next best thing to an MRI.--And a waste of time.
angio might show--oh, god, it's a coup!
fine! Go do your angio.
when you're do wasting your time, meet me down in the morgue.
we're going to snake a catheter in your femoral artery and up into your brain so we can check for clots.
keep this on throughout the procedure.
unless the pot's already made you sterile.
I have a stressful job. You got no idea.
I grew up with cops like you.
one part bully, nine parts hypocrite.
what is wrong with you?
just having some fun.
that man is sick and scared.
the man's a crooked cop.
maybe you should take yourself off the case, Foreman.
don't have to like someone to be their doctor.
Hey, how you doing there, buddy?
just sit still and we'll have you back out there scaring the crap out of people in no time.
happy?
what did the angio tell us?
what are you looking for?
I called my mom. She didn't pick up.
what did the angio tell us?
that Foreman should be off this case.
he's a neurologist.
unless you think the patient's optic nerve is in his spleen...
he doesn't like cops.
Foreman, policemen are our friends.
if you and I ever get separated shopping
I was just busting the guy's chops.
See?--He was just busting the guy's chops.
foreman is essential to solving this case.
medically, what did the angio tell us?
appears to be some clotting, possibly around the circle of Willis.
based on the progression of symptoms, the clot is growing.
we need to cut into
saying there appears to be clotting is like saying there's a traffic jam ahead.
is it a 10-car pileup or just a really slow bus in the center lane?
and if it is a bus, is it a thrombotic bus of an embolic bus?
think I pushed that metaphor too far.
angio can't tell us that kind of information.
Oh, so you're saying it's just a waste of time.
it gave us some information without killing him.
you don't know that an MRI will kill him.
the bullets have a ferrous base!
little tiny pieces trapped in his head. They're not going anywhere.
maybe it's worth attempting surgery to remove the fragments.
surgeons say inoperable, or the patient's on blood thinners.
other than that, perfect planning.
you got a better plan?
much.
bullets identical to the one that baby shoes popped Joe with.
let's see how magnetic it is.
did anybody hear a
I shot him. He's dead.
the bullet split into four fragments, no exit wounds.
only used a half load of gunpowder.
we won't be exactly precise comparing the location on an X-ray to an MRI.
how unprofessional was Foreman?
as him yourself. He's right here.
worse than usual. Better than you.
he berated Joe for being a bad cop.
berated or humiliated?
I'm not sure. I didn't have my thesaurus with me.
one implies that he took pleasure in it.
I wanna know if it was repressed black anger or just giddiness.
you think I'm sick?
I think that an appropriate response to watching your boss shoot a corpse is not to grin foolishly.
but the fact that I've grown bored by your insanity is proof of nothing.
Dr. Foreman, Dr. Chase requests your assistance.
I can't even imagine the backwards logic you used to rationalize shooting a corpse.
well, if I'd shot a live person, there's a lot more paperwork.
then it won't be a problem for you to stand beside the casket at the wake and explain why a cancer patient has a bullet hole in his head?
the man donated his body to science.
Yes, it's a tragedy. If I hadn't shot him, his body could have spent the next year letting first-year med students use the carpool lane.
he's set.
do not turn that on, House.
you're mad because I put a bullet in his head.
at worst, all I'm doing now is taking it out.
my bad.
they have to, uh, shut down the magnet to fix it.
MRI is gonna be out of commission for at least two weeks.
well, it doesn't matter.
we obviously can't use it on this patient.
No...but there are other doctors in this hospital, and other patients.
that helps explain how they can afford all the fancy equipment.
I'm sure I'm pulling my weight.
is doing nothing an option?
I'm just saying. Maybe the clot will break up on its own.
the giddiness seems to have gone away.
the blindness hasn't.
echo his heart.
looking for what? The problem is obviously neurological.
the clots are in his brain. The source of the clots may not be.
do a complete transthoratic echocardiogram.
maybe we get lucky. Maybe the clots are coming from his heart.
heart's clean.
where else can we look?
we could ultrasound his legs, look for a dvt.
I need you to move over.
Joe? You okay?
tachycardia. Heart rate 150 and rising.
he's bleeding out.
house wanted to thin his blood. Sure did a good job.
bp's crashing. He's going into shock.
intracranial bleeding. We need to relieve the pressure.
we need a surgical team.
Foreman, get out!
boy, is he screwed!
we clot his blood, he dies. We thin it, he dies.
am I the only one who finds this funny?
Oh, man.
I'm not sick!
did you hear the one about the guy who bled into his brain and had to have a hole drilled in his skull to relieve the pressure? Hilarious!
someone laughs, they're dying? That's absurd.
but not funny.
if I'm not sick, all you're doing is locking me up with the source.
I'll get sick, prove you right.
if you're not sick, it's not contagious. You've got nothing to worry about.
if you are sick, the two of you are staying in there until we find that why.
so you might want to make friends with the pig.
good news is I can finally get my MRI.
no, you can't!
you blew up the machine!
not the portable one, chuckles.
chase and Cameron are bringing it to scan your non-bullet-riddled head.
Wh-where are you going?
to the office. Got work to do.
eat your meals.
take your temperature every half hour and any meds i command you to take.
so I'm just a regular patient now?
no.
you get your own thermometer.
check your blood.
anyone with an elevated sed rate gets to be Foreman's new roomie.
he should be a part of this.
he's a patient.
he's not irrational.--He's not objective.
he's got the most motivation to get this diagnosed.
right, you're not even friends with him. Why would you care?
there's an area of increased t2 attenuation in the cingulate cortex.
kind of...mushy.
cingulate cortex controls emotions.
this mushy spot explains the euphoria. Question is, what's causing the mush?
question you might want to ask a neurologist.
foreman is a selfish jerk, but he's a neurologist, and he's the only one who's been in that apartment.
this is why he shouldn't be here.
you wouldn't call him a jerk if he was here.
if you think he screwed up at that apartment, you'd keep it to yourself.
no, I--well, we'll never know.
but as long as he's not here, he's just like any other patient.
which means we can dump him all we want.
what's eating the selfish jerk's brain?
west Nile or eastern equine encephalitis--test Foreman's blood.
given that he's the only one who got it, person-to-person transmission is less likely than some sort of deadly toxin Foreman picked up at the guy's home.
who wants to go next?
you're ready to sacrifice yourself for a guy who doesn't consider you a friend.
he's just a patient, right? It's the job.
hey...you don't have to go anywhere.
Joe's apartment is right downstairs in the lab.
foreman brought back samples of everything.
what was that, "who wants to go next?"
some kind of...test?
don't worry. You made the right call.
foreman stumbled into whatever it is without knowing.
he's way smarter than you are.
damn, Chase!
you suck at this.
sorry, it's this damn suit.
I can do it myself. And I'll throw that out.
What'd the MRI show?
I can't be a part of the differential, and I can't even know what the differential is?
you'd tell any other patient what you found out.
MRI showed a lesion on your cingulate cortex.
what's the thinking?
toxins are in the lead.
Viral's a distant second.
do you think the lesion could be an abscess?
it's just a small, soft area, more mush than
was there inflammation in the lining of the ventricles?
there was an increased signal there, yeah.
what are you thinking?
staph infection.
toxins lead to neurodegeneration, which causes the lesion.
not without a fever.
the cop had a fever.
mine could be coming. I could have got it directly from him, or a dirty dish towel at his place.
give us omaya reservoirs. Deliver linezolid directly into our brains.
and we're cured.
samples tested negative for toluene, arsenic, and lead.
what about the blood?
negative for west Nile and eastern equine.
we have to go back to Joe's apartment
no one goes back to that place till we know what we're looking for.
get some of that cop tape. Stick it over the doors and the windows.
I'll take all the hazmat precautions. The chance of infection is next to nothing.
I was never that great at math.
but next to nothing is...higher than nothing, right?
it's not your fault he got sick.
it would be his fault if we did.
we should get a sample directly from Joe's brain.
we can't do a biopsy.
there's too much edema from the bleeding because you gave him heparin.
well, I don't think this is the time to be pointing fingers.
I didn't give Foreman any.
you want to give Foreman a brain biopsy?
come on, really, who doesn't?
this could be a simple staph infection causing neurodegeneration.
without a fever? Not a chance.
Joe had a fever. --He also had legionella.
the mush might be forming an abscess.
and since there was inflammation of the lining of the ventricles, it makes sense.
the staph releases toxins, causes neurodegeneration, causes a lesion.
this is a waste of time.
we should put an omaya reservoir in Foreman's brain and start administering anti
if I'm gonna be arguing with Foreman, I may as well do it directly.
Kernig's sign, negative.
Brudzinski's sign, single positive.
patient Joe Luria, distal and proximal arm contractures, duration four seconds.
staph infection most commonly presents on the skin.
most commonly?
you wanna treat me like any other patient, do it.
but the House I know never uses phrases like "most commonly.
you're not laughing anymore.
no.
think that's a good thing?
sorta doubt it.
staph would be in your heart, lungs, spleen, liver, or kidneys before it gets to your brain.
your organs are clear. It's not staph.
the infection could be limited to a brain abscess.
which I would have seen in your MRI.
sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.
let me see the MRI.
there was no abscess on the image.
let me see it, then.
I liked you better when you were jolly.
MRI was taken over an hour ago.
that soft spot could now be an abscess.
if it was staph, you'd have a fever. Which you don't!
what idiot gave you that?
put the omaya reservoir in my skull and treat me for the staph.
triangle.
this one?
Uh...circle.
next.
Foreman, why aren't you answering? Is there a problem?
uh, s-square.
tell me your date of birth.
is that House?--Yeah. Next.
a square again. Why is he here?
because my neurologist is having surgery.
thought I was just another patient.
you didn't believe that crap, did you?
date of birth.
the omaya reservoir is inserted in the parietal lobe.
my spatial recognition is the issue, not my memory.
did you say omaya?
I could have sworn you said biopsy.
Hey, I'm just messing with your head.
mother's maiden name, please.
get out of my temporal lobe, House.
Hello?
are you awake?
they told me somebody was sick like me.
I'm up.
your voice...
aren't you my doctor?
not anymore.
you're the guy who doesn't like cops.
Yeah.
can you see?
you can't?
not a thing.
you've been blind a while.
the fact that you're aware of it now...
it could be a sign of improvement.
it hurts so much. Doesn't it?
I'm okay.
it's gonna hurt.
the morphine barely takes the edge off.
I'm gonna die, aren't I?
you die, I die. It's not gonna happen.
why not?
you're just too stubborn to die?
they took a piece of my brain.
whatever's wrong with us...they'll find.
do you believe in prayer?
not really.
neither do I.
my dad always prays.
so does mine.
do you wanna try it?
try prayin'?
okay.
how is he?
still dying.
well, you've almost mastered another skill, though. That's good.
Foreman's biopsy results.
non-specific signs of inflammation.
that's it?
we also swabbed for staph. Negative. He's not even a carrier.
well, at least Foreman was wrong too.
Yeah, there's that.
can I go to Joe's apartment now?
no.
go back to the lab.
start retesting all the samples that Foreman collected.
for what?
everything.
bacteria, toxins, fungus. Anything that likes to feast on brain.
that's thousands of
better hurry.
cameron, suit up. You're gonna monitor foreman.
he's on to hand contractures. He'll be in anton's blindness soon.
run hourly checks, because when he does go blind, he won't be able to tell us.
we'll use the data to construct a timeline so we can see how far behind Joe he is.
why are you still here?
it's just another case, huh?
gee, I bet you can even have unprotected sex with your cancer patients without catching a damn thing.
boy, I wish I had your job.
biopsy showed nothing.
how can there be nothing? You cut out a piece of my brain.
it's nothing personal. We just didn't find anything.
can you up his morphine for god's sake?
he's already maxed out, 20 milligrams per hour.
what about toxins?
everything was negative.
there was a cupboard above the stove. Did you see it?
I didn't check all the food, but could be listeriosis.
we didn't go back. Follow right.
who did?
house said we shouldn't go. Too dangerous.
the answer's gotta be in that apartment. Not going is too dangerous!
I'm sorry.
you're thankful.
if House would have pointed at you instead of me, you'd be the one in here.
look straight forward, tell me when you can see
it's your job to go back! You're a doctor! You go where the disease is!
say when you can see the light.
I'm dying, and you're sitting here measuring how fast I go?
tell me when you can see the light!
my vision's fine!
your left-side periphery is reduced.
it's fine, I'll prove it.
Ow! Son of a bitch!
now we're both exposed.
you got two choices.
you can go tell House what just happened and get your own cot board in here, or you can go back to that apartment...
you save me, the cop, and yourself.
it's not sspe. I checked your past vaccinations against Joe's. No batch matches.
blood show antibodies for coxsackievirus?
guys, could you please shut him up?
he's over his limit on morphine.
Where's Cameron?
she said she has some stuff to do. Said she'd be back soon.
what are you doing?
stop! I can't take it!
imagine being constantly reminded of the...pain you're about to be in.
I can't take it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it, stop it.
mainline morphine into his carotid could stop his heart!
so could pain-induced stress cardiomyopathy.
either the morphine kills him or the pain does. --You're condoning this?!
I'm certainly not going in there to stop him.
that'll make you feel better.
Joe has a new symptom. Hyperalgesia.
the infection's spreading to the pain center of the brain.
make it stop! Make it stop!
his brain's telling him that his whole body's in pain, and because of the location, the painkillers do nothing.
suit up. Put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him.
what if he used cedarwood to hide the pot smell?
Aureobasidium fungus could grow there.
did you find any cedarwood anywhere?
no, but maybe--maybe what?
maybe somebody could go back, take a second look?
and why aren't you pissed off that Cameron's playing hooky while your life hangs in the balance?
why doesn't anyone listen to me anymore?
I decided you were wrong.
God, you're weak.
guy steals your article...
tells you you're not his friend...
and you still want to risk your life for him.
foreman broke my skin with a tainted needle.
Yeah.
God, you're weak. Guy tried to kill you.
first thing on my list of things to do would be to stab him back. Shoot him.
I've got a gun in my desk.
last thing on my list would be to lie to my boss about it and then give the bastard everything he wanted.
I'm not here for Foreman. I'm here to save myself.
even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim.
that's why you're wearing the suit.
you wanted to be here.
he just gave you the excuse.
what does that guy have to do to make you hate him?
give me the bag.
mildewed dish towel.--To retest for staph.
what is that, mouse droppings?
hamster droppings. Could carry toxocara. Explain the blindness.
now, that I recognize as oven crud.
could be meat with trichinella. Would explain the high fever.
what's with rye bread?
mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning, which would explain the contractures.
there are three loaves.--So?
you're going back in there.
guy who lives on take-out pizza does not buy three loaves of rye.
that's looking too far into the future.
unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.
you on the roof yet?
