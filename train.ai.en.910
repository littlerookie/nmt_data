okay, because of what you've done, lives are going to be changed forever.
Scofield, have you reconsidered my offer?
if I get you Self and if I can get you Scylla, are you going to be able to hold up our deals?
how do you intend on doing that?
well, that's what we're working on.
the feds-- they're here.
we were set up.
hands where I can see them! Hands where I can see!
killing two federal agents ought to put you back on top of Death Row, Mr. Burrows.
we didn't kill anyone.
self's behind this is a decorated agent and an honorable man.
Yeah.
you wouldn't be the first guy to sit in that chair and try to sell me a bill of goods.
why weren't we halfway to Mexico by the time you worked things out?
you slipped up. -No.
because we were in the dark just as much as you were.
we know what happened, Burrows.
you're not putting this together.
think about how much Scylla's worth.
think of the lengths that Self went to to keep this thing...
to keep this thing off the books.
and us?
us, of all people, pulling this job off.
where are the bodies?
for five minutes, stop thinking about us, and focus on Self!
why would we jeopardize our freedom?
it's the only thing we've ever cared about!
Where's Fernando?
he's on his way.
Michael, look, I still have a friend in the Bureau we can reach out to.
maybe she can make some calls, see where they're holding Linc.
who are you calling?
it's Scofield.
all right. So answer it.
I should have put a bullet in your face when I had the chance.
I'm not the one who set you up, Michael.
yeah? Who did?
you know, I meant what I said before, Michael.
I like your style. Okay? You're a smart guy.
unfortunately for you, I'm just a little bit smarter.
yeah? We'll see about that.
I heard Homeland made a surprise visit to the plaza, huh?
look, I'm going to give you some parting advice.
run.
okay, get your pals and just start running.
we gotta go. Michael, we gotta go.
I appreciate all your help, all right?
I'm going to sell Scylla now.
don, you're not going anywhere.
Really? Okay.
who's the buyer?
his name is Vikan.
and he's not a buyer. He's a conduit.
a conduit to what?
we're not exactly moving heroin here.
it's a little bit more specialized.
there's about five people in the world who know what do with Scylla and are willing to pay for it.
all right. Let's go.
Bagwell's staying here.
you're going to find yourself captive in my negativity if you lay a hand on either one of them.
I warned you not to screw me over.
how could you?
I'll be back very, very soon.
and I promise you, that man is not going to hurt you.
how could you?
I'm going to fix this.
wow, Gretchen, you're making friends left and right, huh?
now move your ass.
we've accessed Self's E. I.D.
we've been able to get to files he tried to delete.
they're giving us a lot clearer picture of who he is and what he's been up to.
honorable, huh?
what did you find out?
a name. Robert Walker.
the new identity Self is planning on using.
we found a Social Security number, a bank account in the Caymans, credit cards and a flight itinerary out of the country for tomorrow morning.
so, first of all, we owe you an apology.
and, second, when we finally get our hands on him, it's going to be paramount to get your help.
how? - Your testimony, and the testimony of your brother and the others against Self in exchange for full immunity. You walk away.
we already had a deal.
if you walk now, there'll be no one left to tell the tale.
DHS needs you to cover its ass.
we can't spend our time chasing your friends.
they need to come in so we can work out the details.
what if they don't?
we got a whole bunch of trust issues.
then, you'll all rot in a Supermax prison.
DHS is prepared to fly into the face of this thing or to bury it.
it's your choice, Mr. Burrows.
this is the best you're gonna do.
Linc, where are you?
in the warehouse. Put me on speaker.
homeland knows self screwed us.
what do we have?
they found a file he thought he deleted
with an international bank account And a one-way ticket out of here.
so it's over.
Yeah, well...
if we testify against Self, we get full immunity.
immunity from what?
we... we did the job They hired us to do.
Michael, senator conrad dallow.
we have evidence that supports your claims.
I'm giving you my word your troubles are over now.
please come in so we can end this
okay, um, I've decided...
rather, I think that, uh, we should hear the senator out.
and, uh,
if everything goes south, then I do Have a backup plan.
Sucre, I want you to go with sara
to the meeting place and get a lookout.
Alex and I are gonna make sure they don't bring Any surprises by doubling back To the warehouse
and then following them to the rendezvous.
this is where we're meeting the senator.
all right?
we'll be there.
you know, my father spent most of his political life chasing justice.
it was sort of an obsession.
and my mother and I could never understand
why he would so easily
make other people's problems his own.
and I think it's why she left him.
and, michael, you remind me more and more of him these days.
the way you put everybody else's problems Before your own.
that said I want you to know that, if this meeting With senator dallow doesn't go the way you want it to,
you don't have to worry about you and me.
Nothing's...
...nothing's gonna come between us.
Yeah.
and everything is gonna be okay, right?
you know, I've figured it out.
DHS wined and dined you in the beginning
and promised you the world,
and then they ultimately settled On a broom closet
next to some schmuck from the faa.
and you said nil.
Gretchen, you have a real keen sense of perception.
it's amazing.
and this all ends With a three-story hut in tahiti, right?
flat-screen tv, a couple jet skis outside.
but what you're gonna find, Don,
is that when the rush is over
and you're done patting yourself on the back
and there's no one left to tell the story to,
you'll be just as alone as you are now.
that's who Don Self is.
is that right?
you tell me.
Yeah.
take out your gun.
what's going on?
you want a cut or not, Bagwell? Take out your gun.
relax, Don.
all right.
point it at her head.
pull back the hammer.
don. Don. - I want my money.
and I want to be on a plane by the end of today.
otherwise, you and your family are gonna find out Who the real Don Self is, - You understand me? - that's him.
do you understand me? - we're set.
okay, that's him.
please.
I'll call you back.
1714 east seventh street.
this can't be right.
you sure this is what he wrote down?
that's what it says.
it's a parking lot??
I thought you and Michael Were going to the warehouse.
michael sent me ahead.
what's going on? where is he?
he's safe-- Michael's safe.
we're not gonna be able to do this alone.
he's doing what he has to do, And we have to do our part.
right now, that's getting on that bus And getting out of the city.
and we got to go now.
he just wants you both to be safe.
we got to go, we really got to go.
where is Michael?
Mr. Scofield,
this is senator Conrad Dallow.
on behalf of all americans, I want To thank you for your service.
save it.
I'm here to give my testimony, And then I'm leaving with my brother.
right over here.
all right, gentlemen, tell us what you know.
are we really leaving?
you heard Mahone. This is what Michael wants.
Yeah, right.
okay, but if the deal with Dallow is legit, there's no reason to run, right?
Michael's just covering the bases, making sure that we don't run into trouble again.
Yes, but if he's in trouble, he's going to need our help.
well, maybe he thinks there's nothing left for us to do.
if we leave now, we're leaving him behind.
I didn't know Don Self had it in him.
now that we know he's behind this, our situation's a lot worse.
we're not talking about our careers anymore.
we're talking about real jail time.
we get 15 years just for conducting an unauthorized operation without Congressional approval.
or not.
this doesn't have to be about containment anymore.
it could be about excision.
you all right with that, Senator?
then they all go.
where are the others?
Mahone, Sucre, Tancredi. - They're not coming.
Linc and I will testify, but the others...
well, we all get immunity. Those are the terms.
our testimony alone will put Self away.
gentleman, we can't have the others running around while we're trying to wrap this up.
can we call 'em? Can we get 'em here?
the deal was for all of you. Those were the terms.
without everybody, - this is no deal. - Listen, pal, you're gonna get what you want, all right?
are you gonna call them or not?
there never was a deal, was there, Senator?
I wish I could give you a better answer, Michael, but Don Self left a lot of rough edges.
we have to smooth them out.
you want to tell me where they are?
it ain't gonna happen.
I can get you Self.
I can still get you Scylla.
Oh, we're past Scylla.
between getting it back and ending this now, the choice is simple.
you wanted your Supermax answer, you got it, Richard.
now time to go.
escort Mr. Sooter out.
I'm gonna count to five.
we've got an appointment with General.
here you go.
wait right here.
been a long time, Gretchen.
no longer working for the General?
correct.
who's he?
I'm the guy that's holding Scylla.
you interested?
well, the General has offered a reward for anyone who can return Scylla along with the heads of the transgressors.
I appreciate you allowing me the opportunity to kick the General in the teeth.
can I see it?
all of you.
Sooter, please, I can give you cover. - Save it! Save it, Senator, save it.
the General specifically asked that I bring you in alive. Just move.
you were going to kill us, Senator.
?? - It was Stanton who made that call.
look, what was extremely complicated 30 seconds ago is not so now.
there were six people who knew about this operation.
two of them are still alive. One is now on the run
and I'm the other. And I'm not saying a word.
you're not getting off that easy, Senator.
you are going to help us.
there is a folder in that briefcase on the conference table.
it contains the last remnants of this operation.
once you dispose of it, none of this ever existed.
that's the saving grace of a covert operation.
if you want...
...it never happened.
I'm going to walk away now.
catch a flight.
maybe see my wife before she goes to bed.
I only hope I don't catch a bullet in the back on my way out.
I'm really very sorry, gentlemen.
we tried.
let him go.
Linc, let him go.
don't.
let him go.
we running now?
I will kill you myself the next time you do something like that.
Where's Mahone?
he's gone.
well, we can do business when you get the rest of Scylla.
what are you talking about?
it's incomplete.
Incom...? Wha-- Who is this clown?
clown? - Yeah, clown.
there's a piece missing, slick.
look. Here.
Hello, Don.
I believe you have something that belongs to me.
come and get it.
your mother works for us.
your mother is alive.
you know, I'm thinking more and more that this is an inside job. Why?
the hardware he brought to the meet.
he could read Scylla right on the spot.
hands on your head.
we've got to get out of here!
micheal, Get in!
sorry, but right now I want my life back more than I want your money.
Where's Scylla?
let's talk about that, okay?
where is it?
I can get it.
no, he can't.
he's stalling, Linc.
it's gone. You're right.
you have no idea who this guy's working for? No.
no clue.
your boy's dead.
and now I'm coming after you.
who was that?
it was my son.
what is this?
I don't know...
just found them on the doorstep.
son of a...
they lay one hand on my mama, I swear on my life...
she's in a state home.
I thought we were working with these people.
so did I.
I'm gonna make a call.
find out what's going on.
Mr. Burrows.
we had a deal.
our deal is contingent upon the retrieval of Scylla.
based on the mediocrity of your performance on that front thus far,
I thought it best to make sure you're all properly motivated.
just tell me how your team is progressing.
I swear to God, man, when I, when I get a hold of you...
if I were you,
I'd be doing everything in my power to demonstrate my competence right now.
we killed the guy who came to Miami.
we found some keys on him.
we're looking into them.
are we done?
not quite.
a new competitor has joined the search.
we're the ones getting Scylla.
well, that's good to hear, because the competing party, is your brother Michael.
Michael's with you.
Michael's getting treatment. With you.
apparently Michael's a little more headstrong than either of us imagined.
but don't worry.
we have a lead on him somewhere in central Arizona.
Mr. Oren is waiting in his limousine.
if you speak to Michael, tell him to find a very good hiding place.
because if any of my men spot him, they've been given a green light.
2, 500 miles to go.
if we take turns sleeping we can be there by tomorrow night.
should we call Lincoln? Let him know we're coming?
Michael, he took the Company's deal to save your life.
and for what it's worth, I might've done the same thing.
then you'd be wrong, too.
you know, this promises to be a really, really long ride.
so, how about we just...
call truce, all right?
forgot napkins.
get down
come on.
he comes anywhere near my kid...
you know, Don, you seem to be taking this whole thing pretty well.
Yeah, well, I'm a pretty calm guy.
all I'm saying is, my mama, his son, his wife.
we don't even know who they got on you.
that's cause it's none of your business.
all right, all you need to worry about is that I'm here to do a job.
Hold-Secure.
the company that manufactures the keys. It's called Hold-Secure. Listen to this.
each key they produce is implanted with a computer chip.
that chip sends out a unique electronic signal that opens its lock.
something that high-tech,
I'm telling you, I'm betting they got a database that'll tell us exactly where each key's corresponding lock has been installed.
look at that.
these keys run about 500 bucks?!
you only spend that kind of money if you're protecting something of vital importance.
like Scylla.
someone just tried to access Carruth's account at Hold-Secure.
and what information was compromised?
we don't know yet.
and who was trying to access it?
we don't know.
thank you for bringing that to my attention. Good work.
yes?
it's your son.
we already have safeguards in place to deal with Lincoln.
I'm talking about Michael.
he's escaped Company custody.
he's coming MIAMI right now
if only they understood what it is I'm trying to do.
thank you very much.
Thanks.
okay, what now?
we'll think of something.
Michael, we can't afford to buy a car and we can't fly.
it's time to call your brother.
got it.
we've got the locations of those two locks.
one's in Little Havana.
the other one's down by the water.
perfect. Lincoln, why don't you and I...
you take Self and go to Little Havana.
we're gonna head south.
huh, that's a surprise.
we need suntan lotion.
be right there.
it's me.
what's your problem?
look, I need you to hear me out on this, Linc.
everything was all set up and you blew it.
you couldn't just let me handle this, could you?
if by "handle," you mean give Scylla back to the General, then no, I couldn't.
it's more complicated than that.
actually, it's not.
listen to me,
I want my life back and this is the only way we can do that!
I don't believe that's true.
you know what, man?
you need to grow up.
look, if that's how you really feel, Linc,
I should warn you I'm going to do everything in my power to stop you.
listen to me: I had a deal with the General.
you blew it.
he finds you, he's gonna kill you.
surprise, surprise.
I did this for us, Michael.
you, me, Sara,
LJ, so you could be with Sara.
two seconds, just think of your family.
feels like family's the only thing I can think about these days.
what does that mean?
Linc, Mom is alive.
what?
guess I'll see you in Miami.
we gotta get out of here.
sir, you mind if I ask where you're going?
dallas.
mind if we hitch a ride?
I got 100 bucks; gas money.
please?
sir?
cab's not big enough for the two of you.
if you want to ride together you're going to have to ride back here.
done.
get comfortable.
gonna be eight hours till we stop again.
if Scylla really is in there, there's gonna be security.
I need you focused.
Yeah.
hey，LIC，
clear upstairs.
you find something?
picture of my mom.
someone must have known I was coming.
someone who's connected enough to be working with Carruth and who knows you well enough to get their hands on that picture.
there's only one person I can think of that fits that description.
you're saying my mom's in Miami?
if she was operating out of this house, she certainly had access to money.
she's a Company agent.
Gretchen said she thought that this could be an inside job.
your mother connect sylla.
she used to bake cookies when we'd come homefrom school, play kickball with us in the backyard.
there's just no way that woman was a Company agent.
you did read her file, didn't you?
I saw medical repos that said she had the same diagnosis I did and that Company doctors operated on her, too.
now I'wondering if they took her off to a log cabin in the woods after they were done, introduced her to a friendly shrink.
how else could someone just stand by and watch while their own children were hunted down like dogs?
maybe she didn't know.
she knew.
maybe it was over her head.
or maybe she didn't care.
anyway, I'm just surprised the General waited so long to drop this bomb on us.
actually, I think that part makes sense.
I mean, for whatever reason, your mother didn't want you to know she was alive or you would have known years ago.
the General was just keeping that secret, right?
keeping her happy, keeping her working.
but now the game has changed.
Yeah, now he thinks you might be useful.
just like Mom.
beyond question, he possesses the most gifted mind of any man I've ever encountered.
well, I'll try not to take that too personally.
he drilled into your office safe and copied your card without you even noticing.
as I recall, you were sitting right next to me.
if we could have turned Michael Scofield, it would have been like having 30 more years of Christina.
pull over.
that's my ride.
what's going on?
good-bye, Jonathan.
this ain't the place.
I could pick that lock with my stump.
no, n-no, n-no.
remember what they say about books and their covers.
when Harry Winston donated the Hope Diamond to the Smithsonian, you know how he got it from New York to DC?
registered mail.
it's the safest way to go.
after all, who is going to be looking for the Hope Diamond at the post office, right?
and who would be looking for Scylla at some run-down storefront church in Little Havana?
all right, let's say you're right:
they got Scylla back there somewhere.
you walk in there, reeking that cop stink, you won't last a second.
that's a good point.
that's why you're going in.
may I help you?
Yes, as a matter of fact.
I'm Charles Patoshik.
I'm a professor of anthropology at Southern Florida University.
I'm doing some various research on various different kinds of, uh, uh, uh, Caribbean religions, and, uh...
perhaps you could start back there where you, you do your, uh, services.
that is our sanctuary.
only the pure of soul may venture inside.
I know.
I- I have been in many such rooms.
let me see your hand.
your soul is black, stained with the blood of the innocent.
I cannot let you pass.
I have never been so offended in my life.
I suggest that you continue your research elsewhere.
if you drop something by accident, you leave a fingerprint on it.
she wanted you to find this.
Why? You ever seen it before?
no.
do you remember anything about that day?
I was four years old.
any idea where it was taken?
no.
Hey.
you okay?
I mean, if I found out my mom was... Listen, as far as I'm concerned, she's not my mom.
she's just someone in the way of my freedom.
all right?
so, on my sixth birthday, um, my father was long gone by then, so it was just me, Mom, and Linc, and...
mom hands me my present
my, uh, my only present- and I just know...
I just know it's the Millennium Falcon.
with the battle alert sound?
exactly.
I totally owned that. Of course you did.
anyway, I had been asking for this thing for weeks, and the package is just the right size, and...
I rip open the wrapping paper and... it's a birdhouse.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah, except it's not even a birdhouse.
it's actually a birdhouse kit.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't talk to her for two days after that, but when she finally got me to open the thing, we sat there together, put it together piece by piece, and it was the first thing I ever built.
and I loved it...
and she knew I would.
she knew me better than I knew myself.
that's what moms do.
Yeah, but the strange thing is...
even though I haven't seen her for 23 years, there's this part of me that feels like maybe she still does.
your truck looks a little low to the ground.
you mind stepping outside?
I just got weighed 20 miles back.
you highway patrol?
where are you going?
you've got no business in there.
unless you show me a warrant, you get the hell out of there right now.
thank you.
goodness.
I got my weigh station ticket right here on the dash.
as soon as you see that...
you'll see I got it right here.
here you go.
I need you to follow me back to Phoenix.
are you crazy?
I got to get this load to Dallas.
well, that's your choice.
I got 'em.
I think we need to call your brother.
no signal.
we must be in the middle of nowhere.
Lincoln said that if the Company caught you...
I think I saw a side door back here.
what about the main door?
you'll never get that open.
I'm sure it's latched from the outside.
can you open the side door?
maybe.
help me out.
I don't think we're going to be able to move this.
maybe we won't have to.
I have troubling news about General Krantz.
he's alive.
I don't see how that's possible.
Yes, well, what I'm hearing is a helicopter with a medic took off from Company headquarters in Los Angeles one hour ago.
it landed for two minutes in Canyon Country and now it's back in Los Angeles.
so you got the corpse?
the helicopter landed back at Company headquarters.
you know how important getting rid of him is to what we're trying to accomplish.
all right, I can still get this done.
not in our time frame.
all right, I'm pulling the plug.
we need to start dealing with the consequences.
wait, wait, wait. First things first.
he knows that I've betrayed him.
I need to disappear.
I think that's a good instinct.
I have a house in Sun Valley.
I have another idea.
do you mind putting me on speaker?
you know, Griff, you're a brave man.
and I thank you for everything you've done.
it's been an honor.
now.
now" what?
the car in this picture has Florida plates.
did you ever vacation there?
no. Do you know anyone from Florida who came up to visit? No.
why did they take this picture in front of that car?
we didn't.
it's been doctored.
I'm not sure about that.
I mean, the lighting, the shadows, all sync up perfectly.
this is a 78 Zephyr.
michael was born in 76.
you're the only one who could've picked up on that.
she doctored that for you.
let's see what else she might've changed.
what's the license plate on that Zephyr?
martin Luther King Boulevard intersects with Route 441
about five miles north of here.
good.
you guys are here. Listen, we're a little outmanned down in Little Havana. We could use some backup.
we got a lead on the buyer.
great, what are we waiting for?
I think I'm going to do this myself. No, no.
come on, let's stay together. We're a team, right?
I said I got it. After our little special deliveries this morning, each one of us has an equal stake.
whoever started this, we're all going to take them out.
the buyer, we think it's Lincoln's mother.
what?
like I said, I'm doing this myself.
if she has Scylla, she's not just going to hand it over any more than the general would have.
you don't know that.
we always thought whoever had Scylla would do what the general did.
maybe she won't.
are you serious?
your mother is a Company agent?
she was.
she might be one of the good guys now.
with all due respect,
I don't think you're in a place where you can make a clear determination about that.
listen, this MLK 441 could be nothing.
but at the church, there could be Scylla.
if I need you, I'll call.
this should work.
come on.
come on.
you need to acknowledge that our chance of success has substantially declined in the last 24 hours.
there are people out looking for us.
we need to start thinking in terms of contingencies.
just a little while longer; only a few more days.
general Krantz refused to adjust when there were credible threats against him.
that's the reason we have Scylla now.
are you honestly comparing me to him?
I understand what you think your role is in all of this, and I appreciate your efforts.
but if you can't tell the difference between he and I, perhaps you need to ask the general for your old job back.
Oh, look.
here he is. Would you like to take the call?
good afternoon, Christina.
it's good to hear your voice.
I assume this means you've retrieved Scylla.
not yet.
Oh, troubling news.
have any idea where it is?
where are you, Christina?
johannesburg. Where else would I be?
I've had some of my contacts in your area check on your house.
there's no one home.
well, of course not. As long as Scylla's in play, that address is blown.
where are you, Christina?
I don't like your tone, Jonathan.
excuse me if I sound a bit abrasive.
but it's been a while since anyone's tried to kill me.
Oh, my God.
are you all right? What happened?
we found his body... executed.
I can only assume that he's working with someone.
someone who doesn't tolerate failure.
now, where are you, Christina?
you listen to me.
if you're implying that I had anything to do with this...
where are you?
after everything I've given the Company:
my husband, my children...
I think it's time that we had a sit-down.
talk. Tell you what.
why don't you gather up the brain trust:
that half-witted daughter and your psychotic mistress?
why don't you get together and figure out where Scylla is?
then call me.
martin LUTHER KIND BLVD. 441
Mr. Burrows.
may I escort you to your table?
you haven't changed a bit.
I'm glad you got my message.
I know it wasn't the most straightforward mode of communication, but I had to be sure it was you.
at least now I know where Michael gets it from.
I'm sure you have many questions.
Where's Scylla?
it's safe.
that's all I can tell you for right now.
then we've got nothinto talk about.
Really?
that's the only reason you came here?
Yeah.
I really would've thought you wanted to know the truth.
I know the truth.
you work for the Company.
the same people that set me up for murder.
Lincoln... The same people that have been trying to kill me and Michael ever since we escaped Fox River.
you can think it as much as you want, I'm not a monster.
23 years and not even an apology?
if I thought an apology would do any good,
I would offer it.
please.
please sit down.
leaving you two boys...
was the hardest thing I ever did.
but you did.
and then you went off and worked for the Company.
you know, you think you know what the Company is, but you don't.
it is a body that bends to the will of its head.
and right now, it is bloodthirsty and war-hungry, because that's who General Krantz is.
but what if a woman, a mother, ran it?
can you imagine the different that would make?
you think you're a mother?
a mother's priority is her family.
if I give Scylla back to the general, he leaves me and Michael alone, and I get to spend time with my son in peace.
look, I could sit here for days and try to explain to you why I did what I did.
suffice it to say, I couldn't protect you then, but let me protect you now.
what if General Krantz were no longer in the picture?
once he is dealt with, no one would come after you.
but I need time, Lincoln.
I need two days to put everything into place.
if you give me two days...
...then I can give you and Michael your complete and utter freedom.
all right.
I'm going to get started right away.
but if Krantz suspects any of this, he's going to hunt us both down.
and for that reason,
I can't risk being seen with you until all of this is over.
how will I get in touch with you?
you can't.
I'm sorry.
once we pull this box down, it'll push the water machine right through the side door.
we're slowing down. I think we're getting off the highway.
I'm almost ready. Hold on.
Sara, grab that strap over there.
all right, hold it.
come on!
you all right?
after you clear the area
I don't anticipate any problems.
all right?
Scylla or not here we come.
all right. Hold on.
hold on.
what the hell are those guys doing?
we're not going against any additional people in there.
we wait until they come back out.
all RIGHT.
so Lincoln's mother is really the buyer?
it appears that way.
I hope he understands, that if I need to take her out to get to Scylla,
I'm not going to hesitate to kill her.
no question.
well, let's just hope it doesn't come to that.
you serious?
Yeah. Am I serious if we can get Scylla without killing Linc's mother, that's the preferable outcome.
wait a second.
if I'm gonna be in the foxhole with you,
I need to know that you have my back.
Mrs. Burrows has the item, and the only way to get it is to kill her.
what is your move?
I pull the trigger.
there they go, come on.
homeland Security.
we're investigating a cruelty to animal charge.
I have no idea what you're referring to.
we're referring to ritual slaughters of chickens.
okay, that might be allowed where you come from but here in America, that's no mas.
chickens?
this is preposterous.
this is because I'm Caribbean.
I swear to God, I smelled chicken blood.
worse than the place down the street we shut down. Hey.
you want to turn this into something?
sit down.
if there aren't any chickens, there aren't any chickens.
but we're not going to know that until we take a look around.
the smell was coming from back there.
that is our sanctuary.
I cannot let you to disrupt it.
I understand your concerns, but I need to go back there.
I insist, you cannot do that.
best I can do is have you accompany us, please.
please.
you, come on, let's go outside until they're done.
let's go.
that's not a very heavenly thing to do.
find anything?
Oh, ah.
Wow.
what the hell are they up to?
I don't know.
he just asked to rent that closet.
did a woman ever come down here with him?
Yeah, once.
I'm telling you, that's all I know.
drop it.
don't.
come here.
both of you, on your knees.
I said on your knees.
I told you not to come in here.
Where's the other guy?
he ran. Let's go.
come ON. Let's go.
are you all right?
Yeah.
let's go.
come ON.
we're not going to make it back to the truck.
I know.
here.
take this.
I'll be right back.
you all right?
Yeah, thanks.
the General should know by now not to mess with us.
the General...
didn't send me.
who did?
who sent you?
we've got news.
so do I.
we're staying low for two days.
Christina's promised to get rid of Krantz.
I think she's lying.
I know it sounds crazy, she said she's going to change the Company in the way it operates.
so what, the Compa's gonna go nonviolent now?
just hear me out. I'm telling you. I think she's lying.
it's from the church. Some kind of credential.
there were some automatic weapons in there, too.
and trust me, if there's fake IDs and weapons something big's about to go down.
your mom, she said after two days, that's when she would make the change.
Yeah.
take a look at the date on that laminate, twdays away.
you think that's just a coincidence? Come on,
lincoln, you can't be surprised that a woman that would abandon her kids would be less than truthful about her intentions right now.
Hey, were you going? I need to talk to her.
just take a moment. Let's figure this out.
if she's looking to head the Company, there has to a more realistic plan than a one-man frontal assault.
she'll listen to me.
she asked you not to come back, Linc.
that's a warning.
lincoln's back at the plaza.
I think we need to realize he's more of a threat than we gave him credit for.
he found the mansion.
his guys got the stash at the church.
he's not going to stop.
I told him to stay away.
we have a clean shot.
take it.
this is an overview.
that's just the beginning of what's on here.
you honor your side of the agreement,
and I will do the unveiling at the conference tomorrow.
I thought we were working with these people.
so did I.
damn well almost got our asses handed to us getting these.
these things are for tomorrow.
I want Scylla today!
yes? - Let's go.
what are you going to do?
I warned you not to come, Michael.
well, it's not over, not by a long shot.
Christina Rose Scofield-- that name mean anything to you?
no.
yes -How badly do you want him, mom?
Michael, listen to me.
that's not an answer.
I'll be in touch.
I get the ass-kicking of a lifetime.
and you come back empty-handed?
what? - Linc and Michael's mother.
she's got Scylla.
here in Miami.
fuel the jet.
we're going to Miami.
the guy knows something.
Hey, I don't know what else I can do to help tou guys. please let me go.
I won't say a word to anyone about this.
never heard of the name Christina Scofield?
I told you, no.
never?
never.
Yeah.
that guy you picked up at the airport.
there's something you should know.
what do you mean?
he's not some innocent victim, Linc.
he and Christina have been exchanging e-mails,
phone calls, you name it.
they've got some kind of plan.
I just haven't figured it out yet.
Thanks. - so what are you going to do with him, linc?
leave town, Michael.
Where's Scylla?
no.
Where's Scylla?!
you ready?
almost. Is that Sandinsky's phone? - yeah.
good luck.
Thanks, I may need it.
it's Michael again.
on Sandinsky's phone.
I thought he turned it off.
well, now it's on.
track it.
Hello, Christina.
I hope you're ready to talk.
let's start with Vincent Sandinsky.
the scientist?
he, uh, he's an old friend of mine.
a bit of a bore, don't you think?
but who cares about him?
I'd rather talk about you.
I'd rather meet you face-to-face.
unless you're bringing me Scylla, I'm not interested.
no scylla, no meeting.
that's all I can offer.
what do you hope to accomplish?
I need your answer in ten minutes, and that's the last time I'm calling back.
and found him.
he's in an industrial park in El Portal.
right up the coast.
all right,
let's go.
you're lying, you're lying.
I don't work for the company,
six words that never prove true.
come on, man, this is over, look around!
what are you doing here?! - I swear I don't know anything, I do
I don't know what he's talking about.
I am here for a conference,
that's all, I don't know.
who told you otherwise. - I do,
and Michael's also full of crap.
he's got no reason to lie. - Actually, he does.
Michael's leading us off the scent, so he can get in...
he doesn't want Christina to have Scylla any more than we do.
it's not the first time he's lied to us.
where is it?
Linc. - Come on, Linc,
he can't talk if he's dead.
you got three seconds. - No.
put the gun down.
Vincent and I need to talk.
Vincent? Yah, Yah.
we had a deal.
new deal.
I'm taking charge.
Vincent and I are old friends.
Where'd you find him?
at an airstrip.
he's got something to do with Scylla.
good.
then you can help me find it,
can't you, Vincent?
and you can help me find Christina Scofield.
Dr. Sandinsky has been a company operative since...
how long's it been, Vincent?
21 years.
21 years of service.
scientist, statistician,
expert field combatant.
what brought you to Miami?
does that help?
she invited me, okay?
she invited me.
who? - Christina Scofield.
I'm working with her.
that brings you full circle,
doesn't it, Burrows?
but you knew that already.
when were you planning on
telling me that your mother was behind all this?
we just found out.
but bottom line is, you knew.
all of you!
on your knees.
you heard him, get down.
Oh, not you.
I don't need to make deals with men who can't do their jobs.
if Bagwell is the only one who is competent here,
he'll do it alone.
What?! Are you serious?!
who do you think found this guy?!
Where's Scylla?
I don't know.
I don't.
she doesn't tell me where she keeps it,
but I do know where she's staying.
a place called edgewater tower, room 1099.
you have today.
one day.
you're wasting time, Burrows.
one day.
you tipped him off.
no, Bagwell.
you stay here.
Yeah, Theodore.
he needs you.
but you'd better stay away from us.
this is where Michael's signal is coming from?
perfect.
be careful.
stay here.
Ckeck it out.
let's go.
let's go!
he's leaving.
come on, he can't be that far away. -Let's go.
out.
let's go.
all right.
where is it?
you don't really expect me to answer that, do you?
actually, I do,
because your life depends on it,
and considering your track record,
I think it's safe to assume
that you're always looking out for number one.
I've waited 25 years for this moment, Michael.
there's no way I can say everything I want to say.
why should I let you?
because I'm your mother.
that's something you can't change.
it's something you can't take away.
it's nice to meet you, Sara.
in some ways, Michael's done very well for himself.
in other ways, I'm not so sure.
Lincoln has led you down a dark path.
I make my own decisions.
you break Lincoln out of prison and he goes to work for general Krantz.
and he has his reasons.
but if you're looking for some kind of common ground between us, maybe that's it.
I don't want to see Lincoln working for the company, either.
at least you've stopped making excuses for him.
I stopped making judgments.
something I couldn't afford.
but that was a long time ago, and that's not why we're here.
no.
you're right.
none of us wants to see Scylla go back to the company.
so, if we can put the past behind us,
maybe we can work something out.
like what?
like a deal.
a "deal"?
all right,
you tell me where Scylla is,
and we'll work out the details later.
we'll go 50-50.
a mother-son operation?
maybe.
but first, Scylla.
please, Michael, I know better.
we're very similar.
I know what it's like to look at the big picture,
see all the little moving parts...
how much easier it is to think after the surgery.
I know you.
that's why you'll never be able to manipulate me like you do the rest of the world.
you're running out of time.
all right, there's no one back here!
well, they were here, but of course,
there's nobody here now.
cause that's what happens.
you know, this
whole thing...
it's just...
it's just... crap!
we're always one move behind,
every step of the way.
Yeah, and it's just going to get worse now that Bagwell is breathing down our backs.
how do you make that kind of mistake, huh?!
and let that inbred get anywhere near us.
no, no, no, the first mistake was working for Krantz.
okay, that was the first mistake. What do you think's
going to happen now that he's in town and he has his goons calling the shots? What's going to happen now?
Yeah, I should've known better than to get anywhere near this.
all right, you know what? We should go.
let's go. - No, we can't go, because you saw the photos, right
you saw the photos, so you know what he's going to do with them.
we should have known what he was going to do with them!
that's what we should've... - hey, hey, hey! Just calm down.
you know what, the deal is over.
okay? You know it, I know it.
everybody knows it. We're not getting out of here!
we're going to take a walk right to the gallows,
or somebody else is going to stab us in the back!
I did that walk and I survived.
even if we win,
do we win?
you don't believe that, do you?
look, I'm going to do what I got to do.
if you don't want to roll with me, that's fine.
what is that?
rental receipt, a silver minivan.
what is this?
what do you know about this?
we found a whole box of them down in Little Cuba.
guns, too.
what do you know about this?
she wanted me to speak there.
about Scylla?
she said she'd give me the script beforehand, that's all I know.
she said her interest was purely scientific.
her interest was financial.
she came to me about a year ago with an idea.
rather than build our organization with Scylla as the permanent cornerstone,
she wanted to use the technology
to make a quick profit.
if certain events occurred,
various nations might feel the need for a more modern defense system,
and they'd come to us for the answers.
solar weaponry.
water desalination.
now, what do you know about all this?
I told you all I know.
well, I thought it was a crazy idea.
plan of an amateur.
but I figured she'd be angry.
she wasn't allowed to hold a card.
now, what was that?
I think it's more than that.
Really?
what did she tell you?
I know how the company operates.
shell corporations like Ecofield,
rampant misuse of funds.
you're literally sitting on a gold mine.
but your leadership
only benefits you and your friends
ten generations in the future.
and you
would like to see the company implode?
I want to see something happen.
you think too small.
Laos?
we'll all be dead
before that pays off.
uh, "Laos," sir?
don't trouble yourself.
I got a question for your friend.
what is it?
ask him what the letters "DMB" mean.
do the letters "DMB" mean anything to you?
I'm sorry.
I thought you understood me.
she said her place was on the same block as Dade-Miami bank.
did you hear that?
I got it.
he'd better be telling the truth.
see what else the doctor knows.
no... - What's Christina's plan?!
I don't know.
I don't know.
maybe we should've...
maybe we should've followed her or something.
sit down for me. Please.
how about I talk to her?
I might have some perspective.
she didn't leave me when I was six.
okay.
I'm sorry we had to meet this way, Sara.
I'm sorry we had to meet at all.
Michael's been through a lot in the last year at some point.
it's going to be too much for him.
michael can handle it.
he's never known a life without change.
Oh, you say that like you know him.
Oh, I do.
better than you.
I don't see how that's possible.
well, you will when your child's born.
see, I wasn't sure at first, but you do have
that drawn look.
and I see the way you protect yourself when you sense danger.
you don't even know you're doing it. It's instinct.
and what is it you know about maternal instinct?
I've tried to be a mother.
even to Lincoln.
how can you say that?
you left them without so much as an explanation.
but if Michael would listen...
you know what? You can stop.
you can't justify what you did.
michael doesn't know you're pregnant,
does he?
what happened?
uh... I got nothing.
Hello, Joyce. -Hi.
how are you? My name is Don Self,
homeland security.
don't worry, there's nothing the matter.
I'm just here doing a favor for my friend.
see, his mother passed away yesterday.
okay, and her last will and testament
is in one of your security boxes.
it's actually box 6468.
is he authorized to access it?
see, that's the problem. he's not.
but we're willing to fill out all the paperwork...
I'm sorry. Only authorized individuals
are allowed to access safe deposit...
listen, lady, I need to get in that box.
Where's your boss?
sir? sir, can I help you?
Yeah. I need to get in my mom's safe deposit box.
do you have a court order? - No. no.
DMB policy prevents anyone... - here's the policy.
okay, I need to open box 6468.
right now. name's Don Self, homeland security.
excuse me, Mr. Frank?
number 6468 was accessed a minute ago.
he just left.
it was the guy with the silver suitcase.
there he is.
Hey, that looks like the guy from the embassy.
Mr. Banerjee, how are you?
I'm trying to reach Christina Hampton.
she's in a meeting right now.
I don't talk to her before five.
the deal is off.
okay.
this is my final offer.
you're going to take me to Scylla,
and then you can walk.
no questions.
no one tells the General.
you can live the rest of your life like this never happened,
but Scylla is mine.
Lincoln would never let that happen.
he doesn't have to know.
even as children, you couldn't agree.
you fought about everything.
the two of you couldn't be more different.
but you know that, don't you, Michael?
this isn't about Lincoln.
you have blue eyes, he has green.
he played with trucks.
you took apart the television set.
and I don't need to point out
the difference in IQ
or temperament.
you know what I'm getting at,
don't you, Michael?
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.
you've always known it deep in your heart.
you just had no one to confirm it.
...isn't your brother.
it's true.
I should have told you before,
but you always looked up to him, and
I had no idea things would happen like this.
you don't know what you're saying.
have you ever seen pictures of Lincoln as a baby?
Yes. - No.
there aren't any.
your father didn't adopt him until he was three years old.
his parents worked for the company.
they were killed in an explosion in Manila.
aldo brought him home the next day.
he felt it was his duty.
he didn't ask me how I felt.
I...I never bonded with him
like mother and son.
he was always so angry.
understandably so...
he was too young to remember his mother, but
he always knew something was missing.
I can't believe you're playing this card.
I'm sorry, Michael.
but I felt differently about you.
and you could tell.
that's why you always felt guilty.
why you were always
throwing yourself over the cliff after Lincoln was already dead at the bottom.
it's why you went to prison and pissed your life away.
you don't know why I did
the things I did!
you weren't there!
who knows what you could have accomplished.
but you always felt like you had to make less of yourself,
to make Lincoln look less pathetic in comparison.
Lincoln was more of a brother to me than you were ever a mother.
you left.
he stayed.
he fed me.
kept me off the streets.
put me through school.
how?
by getting in trouble over and over again,
just like he is right now.
what do you mean, right now?
where is he?
he's out
looking for Scylla, and he's not going to find it.
maybe you should call him and tell him.
unless there's too much bad blood between you.
or no blood.
who's the guy in the ring?
is it Michael?
he's gonna be all right. Just relax.
where is he?
all right, keep up with him, come on.
I am. Just shut up.
it's not that I don't want to help you.
it's just that I hate to see you go running after him again.
Michael. Come here!
Michael! - Where is he?
okay. You want to go running after him,
flush your life down the toilet once and for all? Go ahead!
where is he?
if don't you tell me where he is, or I'll kill you,
myself, I swear!
I'll kill you myself.
come on! Tell me!
where is he? where is he?
where is Lincoln?
where is Lincoln?
all right. Fine.
there's an energy conference at the Panda Bay Hotel in about an hour.
he'll be there.
that's the truth.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to think.
go. Go, go go.
go find him.
I got her. Go.
if she gives you any trouble...
if she gives you any trouble...
I know.
just...go.
you have surpassed expectations, Bagwell.
you're much more than an informant.
I multitask.
hmm. Well, if things go as well as expected here,
you'll be rewarded accordingly.
as a special liaison to the company?
Yes.
what exactly does that entail?
well, that would be up to you.
most company operatives choose their own career path,
though I can't say what would suit you.
what do sexual predators from Alabama typically do,
uh, aside from the obvious?
those days are behind me, general.
what I lack in formal education,
I more than make up for in natural skills and curiosity.
and as you've seen, my loyalty knows no bounds.
then you shouldn't have any difficulty passing your final exam.
now, you didn't
expect that a few phone calls on the sly would set you up for life, did you?
no, sir.
I'm ready for anything.
good. Then prepare for this.
when Burrows brings Scylla back to us,
I will fly it safely back to Los Angeles,
and you will be the one to put a bullet in his brain.
what's going on in there?
what do you want?
Oh, please, keep that open.
Why? So you can lob more accusations and assumptions out at me?
I haven't made any.
Lincoln is adopted.
and you're pregnant.
you don't deny it, do you?
you should tell him.
he'd be happy, even under the circumstances.
it really isn't any of your business.
I'm sorry.
sometimes in-laws
overstep their bounds, but...
you know, when it comes right down to it,
I am the only mother any of you will ever have, so...
you shouldn't throw that away so easily.
Yeah, you know, the only thing I get from you
is a great example of the mother I don't want to be.
it doesn't have to be like this.
Yeah, it does.
that was your decision a long time ago.
Sara, can I just give you one piece of advice?
stay out of the bars.
that's good advice.
I have friends in AA.
they're only alcoholics.
I can only imagine what it's like for you, trying to stay off the smack.
it's morphine.
Hospital-grade morphine.
Christina Scofield will not be leaving miami tonight.
I want eyes at every airport and gas station between here and Atlanta.
and I want the names of everyone attending that conference.
I thought you might be asking that question,
so I called the front desk of the hotel.
said I was from the newspaper.
excuse the spelling.
these are all scientists.
I told you.
those are the speakers.
the names below are "special guests."
sounded like bigwigs from all over the world.
naveen Banerjee? - Who is that?
the son of prime minister Nandu Banerjee.
he has a known interest in solar weapons technology.
this will all be over by the end of the day.
come on, Linc, where are you?
it's Linc.
you know what to do.
Linc, it's me.
call me when you can.
we got to talk.
this way!
don't move.
or I'll kill you both.
where is he?
where did he go?
there.
where is he? - Right there, right there.
lincoln, stop! - Why?
wait, wait.
that's the hotel.
the energy conference.
that's right-- It's today.
the silver van.
the rental van.
they want us here.
something's up.
what the hell is going on?
it's for a getaway.
lincoln, no!
where are you?
running.
Burrows is on my ass. Are you okay?
I was worried you didn't get away.
this whole thing could go to hell.
I'm fine.
I'm right on time.
see you soon.
down.
down.
good girl.
he'll never forgive you for this,
and neither will his brother.
soon, this will all be behind us.
maybe I can meet my grandson one day.
my apologies, Naveen.
where have you been?
I was told that you would call.
I got hung up on a few details for this evening.
you spoke with Downey?
it did very little to reassure me.
I need to speak to Dr. Sandinsky.
Oh, you haven't heard?
Dr. Sandinsky had a family emergency.
his wife was in a terrible accident.
I spoke with him this morning.
he took a private jet out this afternoon.
it's very late to be making these decisions now.
Yes, but you've come all this way.
you are prepared to give your speech
aren't you?
fine.
but in light of the fact
that I did not speak with the doctor,
I'll amend my offer.
$1 million in exploratory research.
the rest will follow in the weeks to come.
that's very generous, Naveen.
history will thank you.
your country will thank you.
see you soon.
may I have your attention, please?
we're about to begin.
thank you. Welcome to Miami beach.
and thank you for attending the first Global conference of its kind,
where great minds will meet to explore our energy future.
the importance of finding new ways to power our world should not be underestimated.
it's running.
they rented this in Linc's name.
okay.
look at this.
these passports. It's us.
it's a set up.
for what? - It's a set up!
thank you.
5 o'clock.
if Burrows doesn't call in the next five minutes
you're going downtown.
general, you should see this.
in the city of miami.
today, the venue will be the panda bay hotel,
where security it high in light of the important guests.
this includes Naveen Banerjee,
son of prime minister Nandu Banerjee,
who is scheduled to be the event's keynote speaker.
banerjee's fragile political position
may leave him vulnerable to criticism on the world stage.
he has aggressively sought to place his ideas
Christina's plan.
what she needed to profit from Scylla.
an incident that'll domino into global warfare.
you're out.
it's over now.
no.
you do it.
do it!
Hey, You need a pass!
at this point in our history,
solar power accounts for less than one-tenth of one percent of the total power generated in our world.
and in the next ten years, that number
should increase to ten percent,
but it's still not enough.
we must strive to seek new alternatives
so that we can break this cycle of oil dependence.
we cannot do that without your help.
so that's why we were here to explore our new energy future
and envision a new tomorrow.
now, our first guest is an author and an entrepreneur.
as well as having a notable heritage,
he has spoken to audiences across the world.
please welcome, naveen banerjee.
thank you, thank you.
good evening, my friends.
it is my pleasure to be here with you today
in this beautiful city of sunlight.
throughout the United States,
I find there to be great interest in the changing way that we all power our world.
many times I have been approached...
No!
with a proposal to reinvent the wheel.
new resources...
we've got to go.
she set the whole thing up.
she set the whole thing up.
do you have it?
right here.
how'd it go?
the van was there with the passports.
I just got off the phone with our contact at the bank.
and they've got clean video of Burrows trying to access the box.
he must have trashed the hotel room.
his hands were all over the shells.
you see Michael?
he was there on my way out.
lincoln's right back where he started.
but really it's too bad about Micheal.
I know you, uh...
shut up and drive.
I'm looking for someone.
a guy named Lincoln Burrows.
the man killed the vice president's brother.
why you want to see Burrows so bad anyhow?
cause he's my brother.
I'm getting you out of here.
it's impossible.
not if you designed the place, it isn't?
you've seen the blueprints?
better than that.
I've got them on me.
Nick Savrinn, as of now, both of you are dead.
this is Bellick.
our wing has been breached.
Marilyn, no!
the chair isn't the only way to take a man's life in prison.
what are you doing?
your father's already in trouble. There's nothing we can do about it.
come on.
my first assignments on PI, we were up here cleaning out toxic mold.
pi didn't go there.
we'd never assign inmates to do that.
this here must be your daughter.
it's over! We don't need him no more.
you're not gonna kill him.
one for the team.
17 days from now they strap my brother to an electric chair...
send 50, 000 bolts coursing through his body for a crime he didn't commit.
I'm here to make sure that doesn't happen.
I've been in Fox River nearly three weeks now.
in that time, I've managed to get out the back of my cell and into the old steam pipes that run through the prison.
those pipes are our way out.
think of this place like a map of the U.S.
our cell over there, that's New York City.
the infirmary, our exit, that's California.
the pipes beneath our feet that connect the two...
route 66.
route 66.
our ticket out of here. - I assume we're doing this at night.
that's right.
we're locked up, fish, and your boy is in solitary.
how are we just gonna fly out of our cages and right into your cell, right into New York City?
you're not.
you're gonna meet me half way, in Saint Louis.
route 66 runs directly beneath that building.
it's the only building sitting on top of those tunnels.
all we gotta do is get in there on PI...
and dig ourselves an on-ramp.
shortly after, we hit the infirmary.
then we'll be outside those walls. - What's in there?
it's an old storage room.
figure John here can pull all the strings he needs.
it's not that easy, fish. That's a restricted area.
I got to be able to justify it to the bulls and how it's got to be some actual work to be done in there for me to get in there.
you follow? - Then you better figure it out.
cause if we don't get in that room, - we're not getting out of here. - Feeling kind of left out.
new york? California?
saint louis?
what are we discussing? - Talking baseball, actually.
now that's a subject I just happen to know quite a bit about.
what a shame. The conversation's over.
really now?
that any way to treat a teammate?
I'm coming along on this endeavor whether you like it or not.
cause I've got a hell of a singing voice otherwise.
I won't take that piece of crap along.
I won't do it. - Me neither.
we won't have to.
he'll be out of the picture soon enough.
the state provides $25, 000 insurance, plus donations from the Illinois corrections officers foundation.
that's the last thing on my mind right now, warden.
do you know who killed him?
we have some leads.
but I can promise you this:
we are not gonna rest until we find out what happened.
his pictures are missing.
he had a photo of our daughter in here.
not to worry. We'll find them.
I begged him not to take this job.
Shauna, I am so sorry.
I'll walk you to your car.
captain.
I need to speak with you for a second.
I'll meet you in the hallway.
I want the son of a bitch who did this.
now you do whatever you need to do to find him.
you understand?
I've got five boxes. You want to give me a hand?
that phone call was textbook scare tactics.
that's what they want.
they want to scare us from doing what they know we can do.
and what's that? - Expose them.
this guy bothering you again, Miss Donovan?
no, Lucasz. The other night was my fault.
it was a misunderstanding.
okay, but if you need anything...
trust me. You'll be the first person I call.
here. Let me.
those boxes contain seven years of criminal appellate work.
if there's a precedent in there somewhere that can help us suspend Lincoln's execution, we're gonna find it.
you can just leave those by the door, Lucasz.
I'll bring them in. - Oh, that's okay.
I've got your key right here.
if I didn't know better, I would say Lucasz was sweet on you.
very funny.

prison Break
fire. - What?
fire. We burn the place down.
how's that gonna help us? - A few years ago the chapel burned down and the D. O.C. realized they had some toxic issues.
you know, asbestos, lead paint, you name it.
they couldn't find a contractor, so they put the inmates on the job.
we spent like five, six hours in there at a time.
but the good news is no guards came around almost at all.
can you get us in there?
been doing a little, uh, thinking.
I'm gonna need a PI card, aren't I?
I mean that's where this whole thing is happening, isn't it?
it's on its way.
you're slow-walking me, aren't you?
why would I do such a thing?
you think Bellick's gonna pop me for what happened to that stinking C.O.Bob.
maybe you'll take a little walk and tell him for yourself, right?
then, I'll be out of your hair for good.
well, I got news for you.
if I go down for killing bob, believe me.
I'm gonna take a little walk of my own.
tell them about that hole you got behind your toilet.
so...
how about that PI card?
I don't know if you remember, but that summer before fifth grade, when I stayed with you a couple weeks, and you thought I broke your glass coffee table...
and when you came home, I denied it.
but you told me you could care less about the coffee table.
you just didn't want me lying to you.
and you said I'd feel a lot better if I just told you the truth.
and you promised not to be angry.
I remember.
well, I broke it.
I know.
you know, if there's anything that you want to get off your chest, you can tell me.
and I - I promise I won't get angry.
you want to know if I killed that guy.
I, uh, went there planning to do something wrong.
but I didn't kill that guy.
someone's working hard to make it look like I did.
anyway, there's a chance the execution may not happen.
what? - Veronica's working my case.
I got a reporter coming today who actually believes I'm innocent.
so I ain't dead yet.
LJ, look at me.
you got to have faith, kid.
just have a little faith.
kellerman. - Well?
taken care of. - Good.
now move on to the second thing.
if you could see what we're looking at, believe me, Burrows is gonna get the message.
which is what you've assured me of before, yet that message keeps getting returned to sender.
now move on the second thing and report back.
we're headed there now.
you're thinking too much.
Yeah, god forbid.
he's gonna toss every cell in this block until he finds the killer.
he tosses this one, he's gonna find the hole back there in a heartbeat.
I know.
we got to turn him in.
that's the only way it'll stop. - We turn him in, he'll talk.
so we're screwed either way, aren't we?
which one? - Right there.
saint Louis.
what the hell are you doing here?
clean up detail. We thought this was storage.
this look like storage to you, you idiot?
it's a restricted area! It's the guard's break room.
now back it up!
back it up, now! - Sorry.
won't happen again.
frickin' break room. Are you kidding me?
they must have changed it since the retrofit.
the bulls are camped out in there. They'll never leave.
you got a backup plan? - There isn't one.
it's the only room sitting on top of that pipe.
it's the only way out, and we've gotta get back in there.
impossible, fish.
maybe not. Check it out.
I don't get it. How does he get in there?
he's a trustee, ones with a high security clearance.
why him? - He can be trusted.
how does one become a trustee?
just have a spotless record for the last 30 years.
pretty much count's all of us out.
which means we've gotta get him on board.
forget it. The guy's a boy scout.
Mr. Westmoreland?
Hey, Michael.
have you found your cat yet?
still M.I.A.
you can always get another.
I don't want another.
besides, it's a moot point.
she was grandfathered.
once she's gone, no more pets.
wouldn't be an issue if you were on the outside.
still tugging on that leash, eh?
Yup.
and this is the part where I extend a formal invitation.
cause you still think I'm D.B.Cooper?
I don't think, I know.
the way I see it, you're in here doing 60-to-life for vehicular manslaughter.
it would have been 20, but the car you were in was stolen.
felony murder rule cubes up your sentence, and here you are.
hitting that woman was an accident.
but the car?
no one accidentally steals a car.
so the question is, why would Charles Westmoreland be in Arizona boosting a car ten states away from where he lived, and only ten miles away from the Mexican border?
and why, two days before that, would someone make a phone call to his wife from a motel in Portland, a stone's throw away from the airport, out of which, shortly after, flight 305 was hijacked by one D.B.Cooper.
seven hours after the hijacking, records show Charles Westmoreland was treated for a busted knee at a free clinic in Brigham city.
only way to get from Portland, Oregon, to Brigham city, Utah, in seven hours was in a car, breaking every land speed record known to man, or flying.
it's public record D.B.Cooper jumped out of that 727 about an hour after take off.
taking a dive at 10, 000 feet with $1. 5 million in cash in a hastily packed parachute, might make for a pretty rough landing.
rough enough to shatter some bones, maybe even a left knee.
D. B. Cooper would've had a car waiting for him when he landed.
according to dmv records in 1971, Charles Westmoreland was the proud owner of a '65 Chevy Nova.
as it happens, a '65 Chevy Nova with the registration number scraped off was found abandoned with a blown gasket along the Arizona border, a mile or two away from where you accidentally hit that woman with your stolen car.
interesting story.
interesting man.
but you didn't answer one thing.
what's that?
maybe I did hurt my knee.
I did steal that car.
and I did accidentally hit that poor lady.
but how could I have hijacked a plane in Portland on november 24?
when I was in Folsom finishing up a 30-day drunk and disorderly?
I hope you aren't hanging this whole escape on that money, 'cause I'm not the one in possession of it.
thanks for the invite though.
come on.
we're okay.
how is this okay, Nick?
somebody just tried to kill us.
I know. I was there. - Then act like it, okay?
we just watched a man burn to death right in front of us.
my god.
Lucasz... my god.
it's okay. It's okay.
we just left him there.
there was nothing we could do for him.
he was dead as soon as he opened the door.
I am trying so hard to understand all this, Nick.
who these people are, what they want, how we just walked away from there without even calling the police.
we did it because these people we're dealing with won't stop until we're dead.
now, if they think we're dead, like they do right now, maybe we get a little breathing room here, - we figure out what our next move is. - No, we should go to the police.
I've been telling myself the same thing, but you know what?
they're bigger than the police.
now, we go to the authorities and all we're gonna be doing is broadcasting to them that we're still alive.
and then we got that target right in our back's again.
we can't hide forever.
no, no, maybe not forever, but I think I know a place we can, at least for a little while.
we just have to go in there ourselves then.
like I said, unless the old man's in, it's not possible.
and even if it were, with the guards in there, there's no way in hell they're just gonna sit back and watch us start a fire.
see, I already figured that part out.
I've been thinking.
And?
that thing you're doing at the pope's office?
using rubber cement? - Yeah?
can you get some out of there? - Maybe. Why?
look, there's a coffeemaker in the guard's room, right?
I've got a hookup with one of my boys in the kitchen.
if we can get rubber cement in the bottom of that coffeepot, when the burner goes on...
it's a good idea.
but without Westmoreland, we're never getting in that room.
he doesn't want to be a part of the escape?
no.
then what does he want?
he's gotta want something.
everybody wants something.
I don't believe it.
thank you. - You're welcome.
Where'd you find her? - In the yard, by the chapel.
why do I get the feeling there's a string attached to this?
not a string, just a favor.
I'm not D. B. Cooper. - That's all right.
cause it's not gonna take D. B. Cooper to do what I need done.
what's that?
all I want you to do is take a certain coffeepot into the guard room at a certain time and turn the burner on.
Why?
let's just say it would be in everyone's best interest if a fire were to start in there.
Marilyn, did you think he was the arsonist type?
I'm not.
I'm the clean-up crew type.
the type that gets access to all kinds of tools.
Michael, I'm grateful for this. I really am.
but I've made it a point to keep my nose clean ever since I walked into this place.
32 years without a blemish.
if that parole board date ever comes, I wanna be ready.
I can't jeopardize that.
sorry.
Thanks, though. Really.
after what you went through in the riot,
I thought you might take a day off.
I'm fine.
I, uh, couldn't find anybody to cover for me anyway.
I hope you don't feel like you own me anything.
I do.
I'm, uh...
I really appreciate what you did for me.
But?
but you told me that you had been up in the crawl space for PI, and PI was never assigned to go there.
we're done here, right?
Michael, don't be like that. I just...
I just want some answers.
thanks for the shot, doc.
sue Parsons. Headline press.
thanks for coming by.
I appreciate you taking the time.
I appreciate you looking into my case.
so what can you tell me?
from what I understand, you have numerous people working on your behalf as we speak.
Yeah, um, well, Veronica Donovan, she's my attorney, and Nick Savrinn, he, uh, works at project justice.
Savrinn, okay.
have they gotten very far?
nothing to go to court with.
not yet, anyway.
you ever think it's just time to let go?
accept what happened? - Let go? Yeah.
accept what happened? Never.
I mean, would you if someone had set you up?
destroyed your life?
I guess I'm thinking in terms of the pain and anguish it's caused your friends and loved ones.
people who care about me, they believe me.
that's all that matters to me right now.
it's all I got.
you have a son.
lincoln, jr? LJ?
Yeah. Why?
I have a source that tells me if you accept what happened and stop fighting your execution, your son will be left out of this.
if not, I hope you said good-bye to him when he left here this morning.
who are you? - One burrows is gonna die.
up to you which one. - Who are you?!
who are you?!
Hey!
don't let her go. She threatened my son!
please, no! She threatened my son! No!
LJ Burrows?
Yeah.
I'm officer Hale with juvenile court.
we just need to do a quick survey of the residence, make sure the environment here is reflective of the terms of your probation.
your parents home?
no, but they'll be home any minute.
well then... better get started.
LJ and his dad - you never said how it went this morning.
sounded fine.
of course, everything a 15-year-old boy tells his mother is fine.
look, no offense, but can I see some kind of identification?
sure. - LJ, we're home!
LJ, you here?
Oh, my god.
drop the phone, lady.
this is the only warning I'm giving you.
drop it.
run!
pick up, pick up.
please answer. Come on, come on.
we're not here to hurt you.
whoa, whoa...
911... send.
you really think you're going to get to four buttons before I get to one?
come on.
LJ, get out of here!
mom? Mom?
where are you going, LJ?
what do you want from me?
cooperation. That's all.
you want cooperation?
I know what you look like, you son of a bitch!
I'm going to the police. - Going to the police?
I don't think that's such a good idea, LJ.
I mean, with your prints on the murder weapon and all.
I didn't touch the murder weapon. - Of course you didn't.
I know that and you know that.
I just don't think you're going to have much luck convincing ballistics of that.
who the hell are you people? - Just concerned neighbors.
heard a bit of a ruckus at the rixs' house.
gosh, you know, I guess we really should've seen it coming.
I mean, all the signs were there.
drug use, decline in academic performance
but we didn't think he'd ever do something like this.
no one's going to believe that. - Yes, they will.
and when they catch you - and they will catch you, LJ.
they're going to try you as an adult. You know what that means?
we can help you, lj. We're the only hope you've got.
no, you're not.
she made that choice, not you.
let's find the kid.
you got Marilyn back.
sure did.
that's good.
how long ago you quit smoking?
a little over nine years now.
you don't mind, do you?
I feel a kinship with you, Charles.
more than any other con here.
and we've seen a lot, haven't we?
sure have.
and correct me if I'm wrong...
I've always treated you fair.
I've always appreciated that fact.
I've known bob since he was 18 years old.
I got him this job.
you can imagine how responsible I feel.
I can't help you with that, boss.
I think you can.
word is he died in front of your cell, and you were right here when it happened.
we've both been around long enough to know that when a con starts that snitching business, he's not long for this world.
don't put me in that position, boss.
if you don't tell me who killed bob before I leave this cell, our friendship goes with it.
that's a nice cat.
Westmoreland knows, and his jaw ain't that strong.
what's this?
nothing.
you stalker.
I am not a stalker. I just...
I don't get it.
what is there to get?
he doesn't fit the profile. Right?
the man's got a graduate degree. He lives in my neighborhood.
guys like that hang out in Streeterville. They drink single malt scotch.
they-they pay $200 for cubs tickets. They don't rob banks.
maybe he couldn't afford season tickets.
maybe that's why he robbed the bank.
thank you. I'm actually being serious.
can I ask you something? - Yeah.
why do you care so much?
cause he lied to me.
they all lie to you.
maybe because he's the one guy in here I can actually get to...
one guy I can...
make a difference with.
go home, girl.
you keep burning it at both ends like this, you're going to drive yourself crazy.
good night.
I'm sorry, Burrows.
both of them were dead by the time the paramedics got there.
what about my son? - He's missing.
the police are treating him as a fugitive.
a fugitive?
they found his prints on the murder weapon.
that's impossible. I...
I, uh... i need to call him.
no, I can't do that. - What do you mean, you can't do that?!
his life's in danger! - Look, Burrows the police have instructed me that this is an ongoing investigation, and as such, any contact you make with your son could potentially aid and abet him as a fugitive.
I'm sorry.
warden, please!
let's go.
that's messed up.
Aw, jeez.
does he even know?
I don't think so.
Oh, man. There he is.
what's up?
we family, right?
hell, yeah, we are.
well, I'm in a quandary, and I need your help.
name it.
Bellick's squeezing tighter and tighter around here. And you were right
eventually, somebody's mouth is going to start moving.
thing is, Trokey, if I get popped for this, what with my priors and...
predisposition to violent behavior...
I'll spend the rest of my life in the shu.
but if you come forward with only your drug convictions and a whole lot of remorse...
I can't do that, - I ain't finished yet.
no need. I'm not going down for murdering no hack.
I mean, you understand that, don't you?
you aren't mad, are you?
no, Trokey, I'm not mad.
no inmates beyond this point.
I need out. I got to find him.
we will. Both of us. Soon.
they're coming after my family, michael.
you got to trust me.
we're gonna get this done. - We're gonna get this done.
how? Tell me. Michael, tell me.
you can't, can you?
I've got to get out of here now.
lj's in trouble. - Scofield.
how about it?
just stick with me.
yo, Bruce, hey!
if you go out there, they will gun you down.
I don't care anymore.
well, you better start thinking about what you're doing, 'cause you can't help lj if you're dead.
what the hell's going on over here, huh?
we got a problem? - No.
well, then get on your feet.
let's go!
son of A...
what the hell's going on in building two?
come in.
fire in the guard's break room.
Thanks.
I didn't do it for you.
found the source.
someone in here smoke these?
lucky strikes?
captain Bellick, got someone to see you.
what the hell do you want?
I know who killed bob, sir.
Uh-oh.
I don't know how that got there.
it's not mine. - Let's go.
it's not mine! You set me up.
it's bad enough you killed a guard.
don't try and lay it off on somebody else now.
you set me up!
he set me up...!
Wow.
your father lived here? - Yeah.
he wanted some place that was completely off the grid.
a place the government didn't even know existed.
tapped into the power lines.
a well supplies the place with water.
last few years of his life, he barely even left the property.
it's... - yeah.
when you spend so many years fighting cops and prosecutors and judges trying to take your freedom for something you didn't do, you use every cent you had on attorney's fees, you wind up losing anyway...
15 years of his life.
almost all of his son's childhood.
I guess I can forgive him for wanting to hide away, be left alone.
we'll be safe here until we figure out our next move.
Yeah, hold up here a minute, h-hold up here.
uh, seems to be a bit of confusion.
I-I'm supposed to be on this, uh, detail.
I don't think so.
Oh, John.
you can't be serious.
not after our long, illustrious history we shared together.
all those nights in New York City.
in California.
in Saint Louis.
they were good times, weren't they, John?
tell the badge here about 'em.
cause if you don't want to, uh,
I certainly could.
I want this place gutted.
the drywall's got to be torn out, the studs got to be removed.
boss, we've got some toxic issues here.
asbestos to start with.
take it up with the union.
all I'm saying is, this room is your only priority now.
better be brand-spanking-new when you're done.
if anybody's thinking about getting cute, trying to trunk one of these tools out of here, Brady's got the outline of every single piece of hardware in here.
and at the end of every day, every single piece better match up, or you're all going to the hole.
let's go.
this goes down four feet, connects to the mainline below.
all we've got to do is widen it, and we've got ourselves an on-ramp to Route 66.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
they're gonna hear this, man.
they won't.
come on, pretty, we a team now.
best get cracking, hey? - You, shut up.
really think you're gonna get to four buttons before I get to one?
I don't have my glasses.
how about you read this for me?
tell me the news, the latest developments.
evidently there was an explosion in a Gold Coast apartment in Chicago yesterday.
gas line everyone inside was killed shamed, anything else?
how about that kid upon Oak Park the one they say kills his parents - oh, they got him. - oh? they do?
he is in custody - Good, I imagine heads would have been rolled if he hadn't been caught lives would have been lost, how about you hand that back to me?
now that is yesterday's news we can put it behind us, can we?
move on next chapter of our life you are not just doing this for me, you know or my brother yes?
they are ready for you, madam vice president you are doing it for your country.
I'm looking for someone.
a guy named Lincoln Burrows.
the man killed the vice president's brother.
why you want to see Burrows so bad anyhow?
cause he's my brother.
I'm getting you out of here.
it's impossible.
not if you designed the place, it isn't?
you've seen the blueprints?
better than that.
I've got them on me.
Nick Savrinn, as of now, both of you are dead.
this is Bellick.
our wing has been breached.
Marilyn, no!
the chair isn't the only way to take a man's life in prison.
what are you doing?
your father's already in trouble. There's nothing we can do about it.
come on.
my first assignments on PI, we were up here cleaning out toxic mold.
pi didn't go there.
we'd never assign inmates to do that.
this here must be your daughter.
it's over! We don't need him no more.
you're not gonna kill him.
one for the team.
17 days from now they strap my brother to an electric chair...
send 50, 000 bolts coursing through his body for a crime he didn't commit.
I'm here to make sure that doesn't happen.
I've been in Fox River nearly three weeks now.
in that time, I've managed to get out the back of my cell and into the old steam pipes that run through the prison.
those pipes are our way out.
think of this place like a map of the U.S.
our cell over there, that's New York City.
the infirmary, our exit, that's California.
the pipes beneath our feet that connect the two...
route 66.
route 66.
our ticket out of here. - I assume we're doing this at night.
that's right.
we're locked up, fish, and your boy is in solitary.
how are we just gonna fly out of our cages and right into your cell, right into New York City?
you're not.
you're gonna meet me half way, in Saint Louis.
route 66 runs directly beneath that building.
it's the only building sitting on top of those tunnels.
all we gotta do is get in there on PI...
and dig ourselves an on-ramp.
shortly after, we hit the infirmary.
then we'll be outside those walls. - What's in there?
it's an old storage room.
figure John here can pull all the strings he needs.
it's not that easy, fish. That's a restricted area.
I got to be able to justify it to the bulls and how it's got to be some actual work to be done in there for me to get in there.
you follow? - Then you better figure it out.
cause if we don't get in that room, - we're not getting out of here. - Feeling kind of left out.
new york? California?
saint louis?
what are we discussing? - Talking baseball, actually.
now that's a subject I just happen to know quite a bit about.
what a shame. The conversation's over.
really now?
that any way to treat a teammate?
I'm coming along on this endeavor whether you like it or not.
cause I've got a hell of a singing voice otherwise.
I won't take that piece of crap along.
I won't do it. - Me neither.
we won't have to.
he'll be out of the picture soon enough.
the state provides $25, 000 insurance, plus donations from the Illinois corrections officers foundation.
that's the last thing on my mind right now, warden.
do you know who killed him?
we have some leads.
but I can promise you this:
we are not gonna rest until we find out what happened.
his pictures are missing.
he had a photo of our daughter in here.
not to worry. We'll find them.
I begged him not to take this job.
Shauna, I am so sorry.
I'll walk you to your car.
captain.
I need to speak with you for a second.
I'll meet you in the hallway.
I want the son of a bitch who did this.
now you do whatever you need to do to find him.
you understand?
I've got five boxes. You want to give me a hand?
that phone call was textbook scare tactics.
that's what they want.
they want to scare us from doing what they know we can do.
and what's that? - Expose them.
this guy bothering you again, Miss Donovan?
no, Lucasz. The other night was my fault.
it was a misunderstanding.
okay, but if you need anything...
trust me. You'll be the first person I call.
here. Let me.
those boxes contain seven years of criminal appellate work.
if there's a precedent in there somewhere that can help us suspend Lincoln's execution, we're gonna find it.
you can just leave those by the door, Lucasz.
I'll bring them in. - Oh, that's okay.
I've got your key right here.
if I didn't know better, I would say Lucasz was sweet on you.
very funny.

prison Break
fire. - What?
fire. We burn the place down.
how's that gonna help us? - A few years ago the chapel burned down and the D. O.C. realized they had some toxic issues.
you know, asbestos, lead paint, you name it.
they couldn't find a contractor, so they put the inmates on the job.
we spent like five, six hours in there at a time.
but the good news is no guards came around almost at all.
can you get us in there?
been doing a little, uh, thinking.
I'm gonna need a PI card, aren't I?
I mean that's where this whole thing is happening, isn't it?
it's on its way.
you're slow-walking me, aren't you?
why would I do such a thing?
you think Bellick's gonna pop me for what happened to that stinking C.O.Bob.
maybe you'll take a little walk and tell him for yourself, right?
then, I'll be out of your hair for good.
well, I got news for you.
if I go down for killing bob, believe me.
I'm gonna take a little walk of my own.
tell them about that hole you got behind your toilet.
so...
how about that PI card?
I don't know if you remember, but that summer before fifth grade, when I stayed with you a couple weeks, and you thought I broke your glass coffee table...
and when you came home, I denied it.
but you told me you could care less about the coffee table.
you just didn't want me lying to you.
and you said I'd feel a lot better if I just told you the truth.
and you promised not to be angry.
I remember.
well, I broke it.
I know.
you know, if there's anything that you want to get off your chest, you can tell me.
and I - I promise I won't get angry.
you want to know if I killed that guy.
I, uh, went there planning to do something wrong.
but I didn't kill that guy.
someone's working hard to make it look like I did.
anyway, there's a chance the execution may not happen.
what? - Veronica's working my case.
I got a reporter coming today who actually believes I'm innocent.
so I ain't dead yet.
LJ, look at me.
you got to have faith, kid.
just have a little faith.
kellerman. - Well?
taken care of. - Good.
now move on to the second thing.
if you could see what we're looking at, believe me, Burrows is gonna get the message.
which is what you've assured me of before, yet that message keeps getting returned to sender.
now move on the second thing and report back.
we're headed there now.
you're thinking too much.
Yeah, god forbid.
he's gonna toss every cell in this block until he finds the killer.
he tosses this one, he's gonna find the hole back there in a heartbeat.
I know.
we got to turn him in.
that's the only way it'll stop. - We turn him in, he'll talk.
so we're screwed either way, aren't we?
which one? - Right there.
saint Louis.
what the hell are you doing here?
clean up detail. We thought this was storage.
this look like storage to you, you idiot?
it's a restricted area! It's the guard's break room.
now back it up!
back it up, now! - Sorry.
won't happen again.
frickin' break room. Are you kidding me?
they must have changed it since the retrofit.
the bulls are camped out in there. They'll never leave.
you got a backup plan? - There isn't one.
it's the only room sitting on top of that pipe.
it's the only way out, and we've gotta get back in there.
impossible, fish.
maybe not. Check it out.
I don't get it. How does he get in there?
he's a trustee, ones with a high security clearance.
why him? - He can be trusted.
how does one become a trustee?
just have a spotless record for the last 30 years.
pretty much count's all of us out.
which means we've gotta get him on board.
forget it. The guy's a boy scout.
Mr. Westmoreland?
Hey, Michael.
have you found your cat yet?
still M.I.A.
you can always get another.
I don't want another.
besides, it's a moot point.
she was grandfathered.
once she's gone, no more pets.
wouldn't be an issue if you were on the outside.
still tugging on that leash, eh?
Yup.
and this is the part where I extend a formal invitation.
cause you still think I'm D.B.Cooper?
I don't think, I know.
the way I see it, you're in here doing 60-to-life for vehicular manslaughter.
it would have been 20, but the car you were in was stolen.
felony murder rule cubes up your sentence, and here you are.
hitting that woman was an accident.
but the car?
no one accidentally steals a car.
so the question is, why would Charles Westmoreland be in Arizona boosting a car ten states away from where he lived, and only ten miles away from the Mexican border?
and why, two days before that, would someone make a phone call to his wife from a motel in Portland, a stone's throw away from the airport, out of which, shortly after, flight 305 was hijacked by one D.B.Cooper.
seven hours after the hijacking, records show Charles Westmoreland was treated for a busted knee at a free clinic in Brigham city.
only way to get from Portland, Oregon, to Brigham city, Utah, in seven hours was in a car, breaking every land speed record known to man, or flying.
it's public record D.B.Cooper jumped out of that 727 about an hour after take off.
taking a dive at 10, 000 feet with $1. 5 million in cash in a hastily packed parachute, might make for a pretty rough landing.
rough enough to shatter some bones, maybe even a left knee.
D. B. Cooper would've had a car waiting for him when he landed.
according to dmv records in 1971, Charles Westmoreland was the proud owner of a '65 Chevy Nova.
as it happens, a '65 Chevy Nova with the registration number scraped off was found abandoned with a blown gasket along the Arizona border, a mile or two away from where you accidentally hit that woman with your stolen car.
interesting story.
interesting man.
but you didn't answer one thing.
what's that?
maybe I did hurt my knee.
I did steal that car.
and I did accidentally hit that poor lady.
but how could I have hijacked a plane in Portland on november 24?
when I was in Folsom finishing up a 30-day drunk and disorderly?
I hope you aren't hanging this whole escape on that money, 'cause I'm not the one in possession of it.
thanks for the invite though.
come on.
we're okay.
how is this okay, Nick?
somebody just tried to kill us.
I know. I was there. - Then act like it, okay?
we just watched a man burn to death right in front of us.
my god.
Lucasz... my god.
it's okay. It's okay.
we just left him there.
there was nothing we could do for him.
he was dead as soon as he opened the door.
I am trying so hard to understand all this, Nick.
who these people are, what they want, how we just walked away from there without even calling the police.
we did it because these people we're dealing with won't stop until we're dead.
now, if they think we're dead, like they do right now, maybe we get a little breathing room here, - we figure out what our next move is. - No, we should go to the police.
I've been telling myself the same thing, but you know what?
they're bigger than the police.
now, we go to the authorities and all we're gonna be doing is broadcasting to them that we're still alive.
and then we got that target right in our back's again.
we can't hide forever.
no, no, maybe not forever, but I think I know a place we can, at least for a little while.
we just have to go in there ourselves then.
like I said, unless the old man's in, it's not possible.
and even if it were, with the guards in there, there's no way in hell they're just gonna sit back and watch us start a fire.
see, I already figured that part out.
I've been thinking.
And?
that thing you're doing at the pope's office?
using rubber cement? - Yeah?
can you get some out of there? - Maybe. Why?
look, there's a coffeemaker in the guard's room, right?
I've got a hookup with one of my boys in the kitchen.
if we can get rubber cement in the bottom of that coffeepot, when the burner goes on...
it's a good idea.
but without Westmoreland, we're never getting in that room.
he doesn't want to be a part of the escape?
no.
then what does he want?
he's gotta want something.
everybody wants something.
I don't believe it.
thank you. - You're welcome.
Where'd you find her? - In the yard, by the chapel.
why do I get the feeling there's a string attached to this?
not a string, just a favor.
I'm not D. B. Cooper. - That's all right.
cause it's not gonna take D. B. Cooper to do what I need done.
what's that?
all I want you to do is take a certain coffeepot into the guard room at a certain time and turn the burner on.
Why?
let's just say it would be in everyone's best interest if a fire were to start in there.
Marilyn, did you think he was the arsonist type?
I'm not.
I'm the clean-up crew type.
the type that gets access to all kinds of tools.
Michael, I'm grateful for this. I really am.
but I've made it a point to keep my nose clean ever since I walked into this place.
32 years without a blemish.
if that parole board date ever comes, I wanna be ready.
I can't jeopardize that.
sorry.
Thanks, though. Really.
after what you went through in the riot,
I thought you might take a day off.
I'm fine.
I, uh, couldn't find anybody to cover for me anyway.
I hope you don't feel like you own me anything.
I do.
I'm, uh...
I really appreciate what you did for me.
But?
but you told me that you had been up in the crawl space for PI, and PI was never assigned to go there.
we're done here, right?
Michael, don't be like that. I just...
I just want some answers.
thanks for the shot, doc.
sue Parsons. Headline press.
thanks for coming by.
I appreciate you taking the time.
I appreciate you looking into my case.
so what can you tell me?
from what I understand, you have numerous people working on your behalf as we speak.
Yeah, um, well, Veronica Donovan, she's my attorney, and Nick Savrinn, he, uh, works at project justice.
Savrinn, okay.
have they gotten very far?
nothing to go to court with.
not yet, anyway.
you ever think it's just time to let go?
accept what happened? - Let go? Yeah.
accept what happened? Never.
I mean, would you if someone had set you up?
destroyed your life?
I guess I'm thinking in terms of the pain and anguish it's caused your friends and loved ones.
people who care about me, they believe me.
that's all that matters to me right now.
it's all I got.
you have a son.
lincoln, jr? LJ?
Yeah. Why?
I have a source that tells me if you accept what happened and stop fighting your execution, your son will be left out of this.
if not, I hope you said good-bye to him when he left here this morning.
who are you? - One burrows is gonna die.
up to you which one. - Who are you?!
who are you?!
Hey!
don't let her go. She threatened my son!
please, no! She threatened my son! No!
LJ Burrows?
Yeah.
I'm officer Hale with juvenile court.
we just need to do a quick survey of the residence, make sure the environment here is reflective of the terms of your probation.
your parents home?
no, but they'll be home any minute.
well then... better get started.
LJ and his dad - you never said how it went this morning.
sounded fine.
of course, everything a 15-year-old boy tells his mother is fine.
look, no offense, but can I see some kind of identification?
sure. - LJ, we're home!
LJ, you here?
Oh, my god.
drop the phone, lady.
this is the only warning I'm giving you.
drop it.
run!
pick up, pick up.
please answer. Come on, come on.
we're not here to hurt you.
whoa, whoa...
911... send.
you really think you're going to get to four buttons before I get to one?
come on.
LJ, get out of here!
mom? Mom?
where are you going, LJ?
what do you want from me?
cooperation. That's all.
you want cooperation?
I know what you look like, you son of a bitch!
I'm going to the police. - Going to the police?
I don't think that's such a good idea, LJ.
I mean, with your prints on the murder weapon and all.
I didn't touch the murder weapon. - Of course you didn't.
I know that and you know that.
I just don't think you're going to have much luck convincing ballistics of that.
who the hell are you people? - Just concerned neighbors.
heard a bit of a ruckus at the rixs' house.
gosh, you know, I guess we really should've seen it coming.
I mean, all the signs were there.
drug use, decline in academic performance
but we didn't think he'd ever do something like this.
no one's going to believe that. - Yes, they will.
and when they catch you - and they will catch you, LJ.
they're going to try you as an adult. You know what that means?
we can help you, lj. We're the only hope you've got.
no, you're not.
she made that choice, not you.
let's find the kid.
you got Marilyn back.
sure did.
that's good.
how long ago you quit smoking?
a little over nine years now.
you don't mind, do you?
I feel a kinship with you, Charles.
more than any other con here.
and we've seen a lot, haven't we?
sure have.
and correct me if I'm wrong...
I've always treated you fair.
I've always appreciated that fact.
I've known bob since he was 18 years old.
I got him this job.
you can imagine how responsible I feel.
I can't help you with that, boss.
I think you can.
word is he died in front of your cell, and you were right here when it happened.
we've both been around long enough to know that when a con starts that snitching business, he's not long for this world.
don't put me in that position, boss.
if you don't tell me who killed bob before I leave this cell, our friendship goes with it.
that's a nice cat.
Westmoreland knows, and his jaw ain't that strong.
what's this?
nothing.
you stalker.
I am not a stalker. I just...
I don't get it.
what is there to get?
he doesn't fit the profile. Right?
the man's got a graduate degree. He lives in my neighborhood.
guys like that hang out in Streeterville. They drink single malt scotch.
they-they pay $200 for cubs tickets. They don't rob banks.
maybe he couldn't afford season tickets.
maybe that's why he robbed the bank.
thank you. I'm actually being serious.
can I ask you something? - Yeah.
why do you care so much?
cause he lied to me.
they all lie to you.
maybe because he's the one guy in here I can actually get to...
one guy I can...
make a difference with.
go home, girl.
you keep burning it at both ends like this, you're going to drive yourself crazy.
good night.
I'm sorry, Burrows.
both of them were dead by the time the paramedics got there.
what about my son? - He's missing.
the police are treating him as a fugitive.
a fugitive?
they found his prints on the murder weapon.
that's impossible. I...
I, uh... i need to call him.
no, I can't do that. - What do you mean, you can't do that?!
his life's in danger! - Look, Burrows the police have instructed me that this is an ongoing investigation, and as such, any contact you make with your son could potentially aid and abet him as a fugitive.
I'm sorry.
warden, please!
let's go.
that's messed up.
Aw, jeez.
does he even know?
I don't think so.
Oh, man. There he is.
what's up?
we family, right?
hell, yeah, we are.
well, I'm in a quandary, and I need your help.
name it.
Bellick's squeezing tighter and tighter around here. And you were right
eventually, somebody's mouth is going to start moving.
thing is, Trokey, if I get popped for this, what with my priors and...
predisposition to violent behavior...
I'll spend the rest of my life in the shu.
but if you come forward with only your drug convictions and a whole lot of remorse...
I can't do that, - I ain't finished yet.
no need. I'm not going down for murdering no hack.
I mean, you understand that, don't you?
you aren't mad, are you?
no, Trokey, I'm not mad.
no inmates beyond this point.
I need out. I got to find him.
we will. Both of us. Soon.
they're coming after my family, michael.
you got to trust me.
we're gonna get this done. - We're gonna get this done.
how? Tell me. Michael, tell me.
you can't, can you?
I've got to get out of here now.
lj's in trouble. - Scofield.
how about it?
just stick with me.
yo, Bruce, hey!
if you go out there, they will gun you down.
I don't care anymore.
well, you better start thinking about what you're doing, 'cause you can't help lj if you're dead.
what the hell's going on over here, huh?
we got a problem? - No.
well, then get on your feet.
let's go!
son of A...
what the hell's going on in building two?
come in.
fire in the guard's break room.
Thanks.
I didn't do it for you.
found the source.
someone in here smoke these?
lucky strikes?
captain Bellick, got someone to see you.
what the hell do you want?
I know who killed bob, sir.
Uh-oh.
I don't know how that got there.
it's not mine. - Let's go.
it's not mine! You set me up.
it's bad enough you killed a guard.
don't try and lay it off on somebody else now.
you set me up!
he set me up...!
Wow.
your father lived here? - Yeah.
he wanted some place that was completely off the grid.
a place the government didn't even know existed.
tapped into the power lines.
a well supplies the place with water.
last few years of his life, he barely even left the property.
it's... - yeah.
when you spend so many years fighting cops and prosecutors and judges trying to take your freedom for something you didn't do, you use every cent you had on attorney's fees, you wind up losing anyway...
15 years of his life.
almost all of his son's childhood.
I guess I can forgive him for wanting to hide away, be left alone.
we'll be safe here until we figure out our next move.
Yeah, hold up here a minute, h-hold up here.
uh, seems to be a bit of confusion.
I-I'm supposed to be on this, uh, detail.
I don't think so.
Oh, John.
you can't be serious.
not after our long, illustrious history we shared together.
all those nights in New York City.
in California.
in Saint Louis.
they were good times, weren't they, John?
tell the badge here about 'em.
cause if you don't want to, uh,
I certainly could.
I want this place gutted.
the drywall's got to be torn out, the studs got to be removed.
boss, we've got some toxic issues here.
asbestos to start with.
take it up with the union.
all I'm saying is, this room is your only priority now.
better be brand-spanking-new when you're done.
if anybody's thinking about getting cute, trying to trunk one of these tools out of here, Brady's got the outline of every single piece of hardware in here.
and at the end of every day, every single piece better match up, or you're all going to the hole.
let's go.
this goes down four feet, connects to the mainline below.
all we've got to do is widen it, and we've got ourselves an on-ramp to Route 66.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
they're gonna hear this, man.
they won't.
come on, pretty, we a team now.
best get cracking, hey? - You, shut up.
really think you're gonna get to four buttons before I get to one?
I don't have my glasses.
how about you read this for me?
tell me the news, the latest developments.
evidently there was an explosion in a Gold Coast apartment in Chicago yesterday.
gas line everyone inside was killed shamed, anything else?
how about that kid upon Oak Park the one they say kills his parents - oh, they got him. - oh? they do?
he is in custody - Good, I imagine heads would have been rolled if he hadn't been caught lives would have been lost, how about you hand that back to me?
now that is yesterday's news we can put it behind us, can we?
move on next chapter of our life you are not just doing this for me, you know or my brother yes?
they are ready for you, madam vice president you are doing it for your country.
we're through the hard part.
another 18 inches, we'll hit that pipe.
we'll be there by friday.
now we got a hell of a lot to talk about, don't we?
this guy says he's on the job in here.
concrete is my specialty.
okay, boss, sign him up.
whites don't want you, blacks don't want you.
you're just caught in the middle, aren't you?
a regular 'tweener.
hello.
it's me. It's time.
Yes.
why are you so cynical?
Michael, I think there's cynicism and then there's realism.
there's optimism, hope, faith.
thank you for trying to make me smile-- not today.
you never know.
you want the cooper story?
I can't give it to you,'cause I'm not him.
the lawyers you tried to blow up, they're still running around.
same thing goes with the kid.
you got to hand the reins over to me, now.
first of all...
you and your partner are off the job until further notice.
that one. - Nice choice.
Thanks.
platinum.
brushed.
six point two five? - Six point two five.
she's a lucky woman.
Yes.
she is.
you kept it.
kept what?
the flower.
I'm a pack rat, I never throw anything out.
Yeah, all this clutter, it's, uh...
overwhelming.
you should see my apartment.
haven't even had our first date yet, and already you're inviting me in.
thought you were a nice girl.
Oh, michael, we all know nice girls finish last.
so where do you finish?
that depends on where I start. Deep breath.
exhale.
inhale.
Sara, we're backing up out here.
right. I'm sorry.
I'm going to get your shot.
this is not what I signed on for.
what do you want us to do?
want us to wave the white flag? Call a time out?
I just want to get lincoln off death row. - Lincoln?
we just learned that vice president reynolds funneled millions of dollars in research grants into her brother's company.
that money was filtered into millions of small accounts, that made millions of small donations to her campaign, setting her up to be the next leader of the free world.
this doesn't end with us stopping an execution anymore.
for me, it does.
okay.
let's rotate. - Finally.
sergeant sodomy, you're up next.
yo.
come on.
I don't know about you all, but, uh...
this room is getting a little too dark for me to dig.
are you telling me that there's a hole in fox river that you don't want to get into?
what?
Hey, no one gets hurt.
you know, I got a question.
how come fusilli over here ain't grabbing a shovel?
I'm handling arrangements on the outside.
Really? So what is that transpo? Paper? - Exactly.
that makes me management.
and that makes us just labor.
now you're getting it.
you know, management better keep a close eye on the conditions up in here.
or the labor's liable to go on strike. You feel me?
get back to work.
Co's coming.
put that back up there.
move it.
it's time for your conjugal.
your wife is here.
so you're mrs. Scofield.
no.
don't worry, I'm just trying to make conversation.
clear.
she look familiar to you?
Mm. No, captain.
I know her from somewhere.
you came.
of course.
how have you been?
fine.
I found a job.
good. I'm glad.
is it awful being here?
remember the first place you stayed?
that hotel by the airport?
only difference is $69 and the free shampoo.
always the brave face.
you're still wearing it.
every day.
I worry about you.
don't.
is there anything else that I can do?
just what we agreed on.
I was so nervous when they were checking.
one question.
why would you need a credit card in prison?
see, I don't think the riot changed anything.
have you seen the latest budget cuts for this place?
another ten percent from health care.
35% from prevention.
he might be the governor, but he's also your father.
maybe he thinks if he cuts enough they can't afford you.
you understand this is standard procedure following a conjugal, right, scofield?
never can be too careful.
all right, bend over.
you have a good time in the romper room with that euro?
whatever you say, boss.
she come around here before? - First time.
you sure?
cause damn if I don't recognize her from somewhere.
maybe she visits some other con.
killing two birds with one bone.
catching my drift? - I wouldn't know.
all right.
he's clear, captain.
make sure you take a shower, scofield.
you never know what some women can give you.
swing low sweet chariot coming for to carry me home swing low you know this one, don't you?
sweet chariot coming for to carry me home.
come on, give me something.
I thought you was the musical people.
you know, parents must be so proud of you, man.
I mean, hitting the trailer park trifecta.
racist...
pedophile, and stupid.
you know, it vexes me that...
that I'm made out to be the bad guy in the room.
it's not like y'all are incarcerated for stealing girl scout cookies.
none of us murdered any girl scouts in the process.
Michael's coming back from the bone yard.
alone... alone.
I tell you everything about me and maricruz, and you can't even tell me you're married?
later.
rough day, huh, scofield?
while the rest of us are in here slinging concrete, you got some little girl to play on your rusty trombone, huh?
the man's got a point.
just doesn't seem equitable-like. You know what I'm saying?
shut up and dig, t-bag.
I think what the idiots inside here wants to know is...
while we're digging this hole...
what are you doing?
I'm going shopping.
we're good.
all clear.
a credit card?
the bulls catch you with that, they'll be so far up your doggy door - you'll... - don't worry.
they won't be catching me with one.
how you so sure?
because...
I don't have a credit card.
receiving and Discharge
authorized Property Embossed Stamped Envelopes nick?
help! Please!
I had an accident... my car...is totaled.
we can't just ignore him.
the hell we can'T.
please!
help me, please!
Oh, god
what happened?
uh... I must have dozed off.
I was driving for 12 hours.
should I get some water from the well?
the well's dried up. - Oh, god, my leg.
I think there's a medical kit over here.
no one's going anywhere.
all right. Say good-bye to junior.
No!
you know how many pints of blood the human body has?
the answer is ten.
ten pints.
how many do you think prince charming over there on the floor has left?
eight? Going on seven?
tell you what
I'm gonna take him out to the woodshed, have a little talk.
in the meantime, I want you to chew on this.
you tell me everything that you have discovered about the burrows case, and who else you've told about it, and there's a chance that I might let you go in time to get mr. Savrinn to a doctor.
you decide whose life is more valuable
the guy waiting to die on death row or the guy wishing he'd die out in the woodshed.
one suit, black.
one pair of socks, black.
one pair of shoes.
shoelaces.
one small tape recorder.
one gold watch.
you ever stay at a fancy hotel, lj?
you know, you leave your room in the morning, it's a mess.
wet, dirty towels on the bathroom floor, last night's room service stinking to high heaven.
but then, when you come back at night, it's all gone.
fresh towels, clean sheets, candy on the pillow.
it's just the best feeling in the whole world, 'cause someone else cleaned up your mess, all you had to do was walk away.
don't you hurt them.
okay.
but you got to tell me exactly what they know and who else they have told, and nobody has to die tonight.
you just walk away.
let me clean up your mess.
I don't know what's going on.
I swear to god!
I wish I could believe that.
bellick assigned me a new cell mate.
who'd you get?
some new fish.
ran a bump and swipe on an off-duty cop.
fast hands, faster mouth.
yo, what's crackin', my peoples?
speak of the devil.
michael scofield.
david apolskis. - What's up?
I seen you before, right?
you're part of that pi crew.
maybe you could hook me up.
you know, a brother needs to make some green
some cash-eesh, you know what I'm sayin'?
it pays 19 cents an hour.
19 cents?
that's slavery, yo. - That's prison, yo.
and besides, pi's all full up for now.
all right.
I feel you.
but keep a brother in mind, all right, if something opens up, you know?
hell, I'll pay 19 cents an hour to get me some more time out the block.
like having another kid.
already raised one, I'm too old to do it again.
you ever hear of anything being stolen from r and d?
of course.
bulls steal from personals all the time.
the problem is, you never know what's gone until you're on the outside of the walls.
at that point, you can't do anything about it.
what if you knew now?
look, I told you, leave me out of whatever it is you got going.
I just need to know if you've seen a guard with a gold watch.
there's a lot of people that can get you a gold watch in here.
Yeah, but I need this specific gold watch.
Westmoreland!
Pope wants to see you!
let's go!
but there is this one co
word is, he's the worst thief in here.
my wife just faxed this over for you from county records.
copy of scofield's marriage license.
she says you owe her big time.
looks legit.
he wasn't trying to sneak in some whore for a conjugal.
says here, they got married the day before scofield robbed that bank.
why the hell would he do that?
heard from veronica?
no.
just a note from lj saying he's with her, that he was safe.
but, you know, it's been awhile.
doesn't feel right.
feels wrong.
I got to go.
really wrong.
I, uh...
I've come to a realization.
either miss donovan and that boy don't like you very much or they have an unreasonable amount of faith in your cardiovascular system.
so tell me, nick, this all you got?
this paper trail of an indictment that never even happened?
is this it?
we know you don't have a surveillance tape anymore.
we know you don't have anybody to testify.
so is this really all you've got?
Mr. Savrinn, that bullet went through your teres major, ripped the lateral margin of your scapula, leaving you absolutely no medial rotation of your arm.
so, if you try to swing that piece of lumber at me...
...It's gonna feel like your arm is ripping out of its socket.
come on, nick.
Mr. Project justice.
we both know why you're really here, don't we?
and it ain't to save lincoln burrows' life.
inside these walls, I creep and I crawl, looking for a way out.
but I know it's gonna be no easy route.
this is gonna be a 12 round... 12 round bout.
with bellick and t-bag on my mind...
...It's grindin' here...
still interested in getting in on pi?
does my mama got big breastices?
I wouldn't know.
hell, yeah, she does, and hell, yeah, I do.
all right, look, I need a favor.
word is, you made your trade as a snatch and grab.
that's right.
I need you to steal something back that was stolen from me.
what kind of somethin' we talkin' about?
just a watch.
there ain't no such thing as "just a watch.
every design has a different clasp, every clasp has a different swipe.
it's italian, a remedi.
gold band, pearl face, all-weather.
what year? - 2003.
there's a butterfly clasp on that bitch.
which means what?
hidden deployment.
there ain't no way to snatch it without the mark feeling it
which just means I'm gonna have to get whimsical on this ficky.
I get you this watch, that mean I get in on some of that pi?
it means I'll think about it-- no promises.
why you need this watch so bad anyway?
let's just say it means a lot to someone in my family.
come in, charles. Sit down.
what's going on?
I've got some bad news, charles.
your daughter is very sick.
she's got esophageal cancer.
now, she's at sacred heart in indianapolis.
and she wants to see you while there's still time.
how much time?
doctors say a few weeks.
the problem is, the D. O.C. Is not gonna let you go.
they think you're still a flight risk.
she's my only child.
I know that.
believe me, charles, I've lobbied on your behalf.
I-I...
it's-it's state policy.
they will only extend furloughs in the case of funerals.
you're telling me I have to wait until she dies before I see her?
Mr. Scofield, looks like I'll be administering your shot today.
Where's dr. Tancredi?
we've got a busy schedule today.
she's with another patient.
hold him down before he jumps off the cart!
hold his legs!
hold his legs down!
Hey, we need a doctor here!
all right. What's happened?
I don't know. The kid was in chow.
then all of sudden, he-he collapsed, and he started spittin' up his food.
looks like he's having some kind of a seizure.
get him up here, get him up here.
and make sure he doesn't hurt himself.
up, up, up...
I gonna o2 and a cardio...
hold him, hold him!
so, ms. Donovan, how is that background in real estate law going for you?
it's a big help?
hmm?
you know, frankly, I think we caught a break.
Lincoln had nailed a girl with half a brain, she probably would have brought this whole thing down already.
but you know what the worst part is?
that you dragged these people into this, knowing that you had no clue how to get them out.
I mean, if you had just minded your own business, people like leticia barris
she wouldn't have a mouthful of maggots right about now.
your fianc?
in his apartment waiting for the smell of his rotting corpse to let the neighbors know that something had gone horribly wrong.
that's right-- their deaths are on your head.
you made this mess.
nobody else. You.
but you're also the one person that can end it all right here.
all I need to know is who else you've involved.
so, you just nod, and I'll know you're ready to talk.
you know, ms. Donovan,
I think that, uh, you look a little cold.
maybe you'll find it easier to talk...
after you've warmed up a little bit.
where is he?
what happened? - We got to move.
come on, we don't have time.
come on!
come on, we're getting out of here.
where are the keys?
look in there.
start the car!
okay. Is he gonna be all right?
go start the car, lj!
we're gonna get you to a hospital, all right?
come on, come on!
a gift from my cell mate.
thank you.
and thank him.
the watch--what's it for anyway?
thought you didn't want to know about any of this.
things have changed.
I want in.
why the sudden change of heart?
I have my reasons.
don't take this the wrong way, but everyone who's in is bringing something to the table.
how about money? - How much we talking about?
I think you know.
I seem to remember several conversations that ended with, "I am not D. B. Cooper.
I lied. - You lied?
we're cons. We tend to do that.
I checked your alibi.
according to records, you were incarcerated at the time of the cooper hijacking.
my father and I share more than just a weakness for easy money.
we also share a name.
Charles westmoreland, senior was the one locked up that day.
now, do you want the money or not?
no offense, but it's a little convenient.
you want in, and suddenly, you're the guy.
how do I know you're not lying right now?
Hey, old man river, keep it moving.
Hey, sucre...
I got a question about you and the rest of the mexicans.
I don't think I'll be able to help, seeing as I'm puerto rican.
geographical semantics, amigo.
I'm speaking about the general "latin-o" population.
how is it that a-a people so historically lazy ended up being such a big part of the nation's work force?
the way I see things, it's everyone else that's lazy.
otherwise, there wouldn't be any jobs for the immigrants.
the ones sitting at home collecting unemployment, the lazy ones--it's not us.
you-you gonna let him talk about your people like that?
uh, whatever, deliverance.
you know what? We may be a team in here, but just so that you know, the minute we get over that wall, it's every man for himself.
or sooner.
LJ?
LJ?
LJ?
and, well, any-anyone you've ever loved.
how does that sound?
go to hell. - Oh, come on.
is that any way for a lady to talk?
Oh.
what, do you think I'm an idiot?
I'm just going to walk into a well?
seriously, ms. Donovan.
you all right?
Scofield, no sitting down on the job.
I want you out here working where I can see you.
I'm on it, boss.
move it, scofield. Move it!
Hey, brad. Good to see you.
Hey, baby.
all right, ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for our next lovely young lady.
up on the main stage, it's jasmine.
would you like a private dance?
why don't you sit down and chat for awhile.
see if we hit it off.
so, what's your name? - Brad.
yours?
jasmine.
come on...
your real name.
Nika.
now that's a pretty name.
tell me, nika,
I'm not married.
I hope you're lying for the sake of titillation.
otherwise, your little visit to fox river this morning would have been breaking the law...
Mrs. Scofield.
we are married. But they tell all the girls to lie.
it's better for making business.
I'm not here to get you in trouble.
I just want to know a little more about your husband.
well, he's a very good man.
I'm sure he is.
but even good men do bad things.
your accent. You're from
now, don't tell me
Budapest, right?
Prague.
Prague...
how recently did you come over?
only a couple months, I bet.
you like it here in america?
you know, I really have to keep moving.
they don't like us to spend too much time in one spot.
now I don't want to have to check into your immigration status...
I just need to know what michael scofield wanted from you in exchange for the green card.
nothing.
we met while he was studying overseas...
I don't want to know what you memorized for the ins.
now, either you answer my questions about scofield, or I call my guy in the chicago P. D.
and maybe he starts asking some questions about you.
a credit card.
he asked me to bring him a credit card.
that's it.
Yeah, kellerman? Trace this call.
come and get me-- now.
new glarus, I'm in new glarus.
no, thanks, I brought my own.
Dorothy andrews elston kabis.
united states treasurer, 1971.
the year of the D. B. Cooper hijacking.
the first number in a series of bills used in the ransom drop.
thanks for the history lessen.
same as me.
so, you're married.
uh, well...
not in the traditional sense of the word.
Michael, we're both adults, put your cards on the table.
okay, I'll got first.
um...
as one of the very few women around here,
I'm used to a certain amount of innuendo and flirtation being thrown my way.
I'm not used to enjoying it.
look, sara...
it's "dr. Tancredi,
and please let me finish.
I'm not a jealous woman.
but I am a careful one.
and for some reason, when I'm around you, I'm not.
careful. - You don't have to be.
Yes, I do.
there are so many questions surrounding you, michael.
there are way too many.
so here's the deal.
from now on, your shots, any medical concerns, they're all fine, as long as it's doctor-patient.
but personal questions and favors of any kind, are no longer a part of our relationship.
the questions you have about me...
there are answers.
Quinn!
I was getting worried.
you guys get lost?
but you never picked up.
Yeah, the battery went dead on the damn cell phone.
what are you going to do, right?
so, uh, how'd it go?
I have a broken leg down here.
Yeah, listen, you know,
I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot.
you have bosses, I have bosses.
but at the end of the day, we're all on the same team.
right? We're both just trying to tie up some loose ends.
I could not agree more.
Yeah, so, can you guys get a rope or a ladder, or something?
what the hell was that?
hey... hey! Hey!
just tying up some loose ends.
you stupid son of...
Hey, guys! Hey!
Hey, don't do this!
don't do this!
please! My leg's broken, I can't stand!
you have to help me!
you can't just leave him down there.
he'll die.
he's the only one who knows we don't have the burrows kid.
the only one.
I have a family.
I have a family!
there's room for you down there too, danny.
don't leave me like this!
don't leave me!
please!
please!
you coming back to pi today?
it's getting kind of testy in there, you know?
yeah
I just needed to find something out.
what the hell is that?
listen.
am I supposed to be hearing something?
just hold on.
there. - What?
we sat around here for 20 minutes waiting to hear that?
18 minutes, actually.
and, yes.
what was it? - Keys.
the guards' keys.
18 minutes is how long we have between each time the guards pass beneath the infirmary windows on their rounds at night.
cons aren't allowed outside after hours.
it was the only way I could find out the timing.
what does that mean? - It means...
four days from now, on the night of the escape, we'll have 18 minutes to get the bars off the infirmary window, and for all seven of us to get across the wire and over the wall.
is that doable? - Of course.
what's up?
nothing.
Hey, I know that look.
I hit it! I hit it!
there it is, the pipe!
guys, guys.
come on, michael, talk to me.
you want the good news or the bad?
the good.
Westmoreland and his money are in.
what's the bad?
I've done the math.
I figure it'll take at least five minutes for us to get the bars off the window in the infirmary.
and two minutes each for us to get across the wire and over the wall.
so? - We've only got 18 minutes.
we've got too many people.
one of them has to go.

I want him under 24-hour surveillance.
I have to be there when they kill this man.
the least you could do is review his case.
the thing I can't quite figure is with the the crap storm this thing's become why they haven't killed you.
have at him.
now, out of respect for what you once were,
I'm going to let you walk away.
why don't you hand me that shank you're holding?
I'm not even sure why you need it.
thank you.
your keys are right over there by your in-box.
you got a maintenance guy waiting outside here, says you want him to change the locks.
want me to call himff?
no, send him in.
it's your last chance, Tweener.
Scofield and his whole PI crew...they'll escape
you know I can't let you leave here, boss.
dogs.
the numerous times I've been apprehended while trying to elude the authorities it's always because of the damn dogs.
turns out you can run from just about everything in your life 'cept your own particular stink.
Yeah, Well, some of us stink more than others.
Kinte, you can smell like a bouquet of bonbons, but unless you get rid of your sml you might as well send a note to the police with directions and some cab fare.
Theodore's right, man.
we got to scrub down our cells.
what about our bunks? Pillows, sheets, everything.
either get rid of your smell or change it.
well, how much time we got?
three days. That's the soonest
I could get us into the Guards' Room for PI.
you think you'll have the extra suits by the
probably. They should be here tomorrow.
good, so we're good to go.
all we got left is figuring out how to get through that door in the infirmary.
and how to get Linc out of that box.
and you can do that in three days?
three days should be plenty of time.
we got to get out of here.
now.
the hole's just sitting there?
I covered it the best I could, but it's just a matter of time before someone discovers Bellick's missing.
what do you mean Bellick's missing?
okay, okay, okay.
fox River is a biglace.
maybe they won't notice for a while.
nothing happens around here without Bellick's say-so.
somebody is gonna notice that he's missing.
and when they do, they're gonna close this place down until they find him.
what are we going to do?
as soon as it gets dark...
we go. Tonight?
pretty, we ain't ready to escape tonight.
escape already srted.
it started the minute Bellick found that hole.
it's gonna end the minute they figure out that he's missing.
then stay!
I'll be sure to read the papers in the morning.
see how many years you got when they realized which crew was working in that room and dug that hole.
so what's the play, man?
you think you can have the plane ready by tonight?
sure.
you had kitchen duty, right? Yeah.
What'd you use to scrub down the floors?
I think it was some peroxide or something like that.
that'll work. Get as much as you can.
I'll work on getting us that key to the infirmary.
the rest of you find whatever you can to get rid of the scent in your cells.
none of this matters, if we can't get in the guards' room.
we're gonna leave after dinner, during tier time when the gates are open.
7: 00, one by one, through my cell.
now, we were supposed to go through the guards' room.
that was going to give us a head start hours before they even found out we were missing.
we leave through your cell, we ain't got no lead time.
7: 00. Count's at 8: 00, that's... 60 minutes.
60 minutes to get over that wall and as far away from here as possible.
they'll be right on our asses.
quit your talkin' and start your walkin'.
ladies, yard time is over!
they already are.
let's go, let's go.
you know, there's one thing we didn't talk about out there- your brother.
I mean, he's under 24-hour surveillance.
I'm just saying, if you can't get to him by tonight, we still have to go, you know that, right?
Hey, boss.
what do you want?
my brother's in Gen Pop.
he's got no clue I was in an accident.
so?
well, is there any way I can get a message to him?
Yeah.
put it in your will.
and you're sure all those dots connect?
okay.
thank you.
who was that?
a friend of mine at the title company, handled a lot of my firm's business.
she dug up an address for that phone number in Blackfoot.
where is it?
it's not the where that's interesting, it's the how.
it turns out our little place in Montana was purchased for $2 million by an offshore holding corporation.
that's pretty standard for a transaction that size, though, right?
sure. Only this holding corporation was bankrolled by a trust
a trust financed by the estate of Terrence Steadman.
looks like you and I are going to Blackfoot, Montana.
have you seen Bellick today?
no, Why?
Mack was asking. I guess he ain't showed up yet.
he's probably just late.
Bellick? I haven't beat that guy to work in eight years.
Scofield, this ain't Gibson's. Move it.
they're already starting to ask questions, man.
we're not going to make it out of here in seven hours without them finding answers.
how we coming with that peroxide?
I'm going to need it before we meet up for yard duty.
probably not till later.
you want to tell me what you need it for?
Makkos, you going to be eating them there brussels sprouts? No.
you mind if I, uh...
take 'em.
they smell like crap.
do they, now?
what's up?
yo, if you...
tonight.
what?
change of plans.
why, did something happen?
just find Sucre. He'll tell you what you need to do to be ready.
what about...? Tonight.
what the hell's going on?
the president changed his mind.
we were given assurances he would veto t he energy bill.
assurances can tell you everything that a man is going to do, until he wakes up in the morning and changes his mind.
then change it back.
I don't think you understand.
the president... Have you enjoyed our support?
Yes. Good.
we certainly wouldn't want you to take it for granted.
are you threatening me?
Why?
do you feel threatened?
Caroline, we've all been through this before.
the ebbs and flows of political conscience, but we've found at the end of the day, we get what we want.
it's simply a matter of who helps us get it.
if you can't convince a doddering old fool finishing up his second term what the best thing is for this country's economy, perhaps you're not the kind of helper we're looking for.
I was thinking about something...
enough, Michael. Enough with the-the lies and the coincidences and the stories, all of it.
it's not what you think. I know what you did.
the question is, are you man enough to admit it?
the keys.
Congratulations.
is that the first time you've been honest with me?
it's not... The second?
what are you after, Michael?
is it drugs?
is it needles?
neither.
then what?
please understand that I never meant...
I never wanted to involve you in this.
well, you've done a pretty poor job of that.
I came he to tell you something.
I'm getting my brother out of here.
tonight.
and I need you help
Michael, uh, honestly, for your own good, don't say anything more. You know he's innocent.
do what you're talking about and he won't be.
but he'll still be alive.
you understand that I'm required to report everything you're telling me.
Yes. Then why would you?
because you're the only one that can help.
and because I know you want to be part of the solution.
Yeah, aiding and abetting is not part of the solution.
neither is doing nothing knowing what you know about his case.
how dare you put this on me.
I did what I could. I gave my father the information from...
no offense to your father, but the people who are framing Lincoln, let's just say they have a higher security clearance.
so now it's a conspiracy? I didn't come here to have a debate.
you're asking me to break the law.
I'm asking you to make a mistake.
not hurt anyone, not steal anything.
just...
forget to lock up.
leave the door unlocked when you leave tonight.
that's it.
please.
this is where you're breaking out of?
this room?
there are alarm contacts on the glass surrounding the door.
otherwise I wouldn't need you to...
I was part of your plan.
was it all an act?
at first, yes.
I needed to be here.
but then I wanted to be here with you.
right.
and it's killing me to know that you'll never believe that.
whatever you may think of me, this is about Lincoln.
don't make him pay for my mistakes.
yeah?
Hi, it's me.
there's been an acceleration.
how fast we talking about?
fast. Tonight.
son of a bitch.
I think what you're trying to say is no problem?
Yeah, of course. It'll be taken care of.
good.
the van?
waiting up Fitz Street, 200 yards...
behind the old mill?
behind the old mill, I got it.
one question, John.
don't you want a bigger plane?
you've only got three seats.
I thought you said there were seven or eight guys.
well, not everybody gonna have a ticket.
you gonna tell me who is?
the three of us still breathing.
whatever airport's closer to Blackfoot.
aisle, window, it doesn't matter, just get us on the next flight.
Yeah, I'll hold.
Hello?
change of plans. We're going to need you to have the girl at the airstrip tonight.
tonight?
was I not enunciating?
no, it's just that, uh...
things could get messy.
so where is Mark?
Patterson and Pope's secretary?
come on, man, like you wouldn't hit that.
I don't know, Vegas, 2: 00 a. m. maybe, but...
if she didn't have such a big booty.
man, the booty is the man's biggest weakness.
I know I would've hit it.
find a way to the infirmary yet?
I'm working on it
yo, you seen Bellick today?
not yet.
I need to talk to him.
do you know if he went somewhere?
do I look like his mother?
the guy hasn't shown up yet.
you sure he ain't showed yet?
cause I thought I saw him here this morning, man.
need a hand over here.
Yeah, I'm on it.
all right?
fine.
just, uh... just sore, that's all.
you live to my age, you'll know all about it.
you know you got a couple foxes in your hen house, right?
who are we talking about?
the bastard and the born again.
they both want out of here.
they'll behave until then. Think so?
I just picked this off of T-Bag yesterday.
if I would've been there ten seconds later, they'd have been serving
Abruzzi with red sauce over at the morgue.
now I know you want to be shot caller and everything, and that's cool, but you got to handle things, man.
are you picking up what I'm putting down?
Yeah.
look, this is it, man.
ain't no do-overs this time.
can't be no complications.
we break out tonight or we ain't never getting out.
we got that paperwork in from the county.
Yeah. Sorry.
the paperwork from the county. Right. I got it.
um... do me a favor, could you take care of that for me?
I got to get out of here. Sure.
Thanks.
wait, where are you going? Out.
put your blues on over your PI gear.
what? Just do it.
you want to tell us why?
if we don't have time to get the suits we need, we're gonna have to make them. What the hell are you doing, man?
we got company.
it's okay.
he's coming with us.
Hey, whatever happened to "We got too many people"?
when the plan changed, so did the timing.
we'll make sure we all get through.
well, for health reasons, information like that should be disseminated a little more pronto.
uh-uh, Fish.
one more person means there's one more thing that can go wrong.
he is not coming.
it's not up for discussion. The hell it ain't.
I owe him.
I don't owe you a damn thing.
you're gonna...
if we get nailed 'cause you didn't want to cut down on your damn guest list.
don't worry, it'll be fine.
Hey.
hold up, cons.
I saw some drops of blood on the floor of the PI locker room.
now who's going to tell me what's going on?
that'd be me, boss.
I, uh, did it while I was loading some equipment back into the shed.
you make sure and get that patched up.
will do.
okay.
move it.
are you okay?
okay enough to make it out of here tonight.
I swear.
Hey, Shelly, this is, uh, it's me.
I, listen, I know I'm supposed to call you as my sponsor in case I have a, um...
right.
I think we should break a bottle of champagne across its bow.
well, if you're intending to get this thing home for your anniversary tonight, I wouldn't recommend it.
No!
listen, I want you to know that I... well,
I feel very fortunate to have met you.
Yeah. I'm guessing not many structural engineers make their way into Fox River.
no, no, I don't mean because of your vocation.
I mean because you're a decent young man and there are not many of those who make their way into Fox River.
well, for what it's worth, there are a few down there.
well, that's good to hear.
listen, I know this goes without saying, but, uh... if there's anything you need...
well, let's just say that I owe you one.
actually... there is one thing you can do for me.
so this whole thing this whole time, was never about me.
it was about Dad.
I can't believe...
Michael! What?
you got something you want to tell me?
just told you everything we knew about Dad was a lie and you barely blinked.
we have to go.
tonight. What are you talking about?
bellick found the hole, so either we go now or it's over.
Michael... Look, I know it's going to be tight, but I can do this.
Michael, stop it.
the chains on your locks, they're, uh...
Michael! Michael! I can do this!
listen to me!
go.
you gotta go. Don't say that.
look at me!
you can't do this. There's not enough time.
if you stay here, they'll nail you and you'll rot in here.
I'm not asking you, man, I'm telling you.
leave me behind.
go.
what the hell you think you doing?
nothing, man.
you trying to run something for those Wonder Breads you been running around with?
no, it ain't even like that.
tell me something, boy.
is you steppin', or is you fetchin'?
I thought I made myself clear when I said your punk ass was no longer in business.
this ain't business, all right?
this is personal.
what you got there anyway? Some kind of cleaner?
what you trying to clean up...
sergeant Franklin?
news ANCHOR Correspondent Nancy Lou has the details.
rumors coming out of Vice President Reynolds' camp detail a preliminary short list of running mates should she, as expected, win her party's nomination.
perhaps the biggest surprise is the inclusion of Illinois governor Frank Tancredi.
his consideration is attributed to his reputation for being tough on crime.
and some point to his recent refusal to grant clemency to Lincoln Burrows, the murderer of the vice president's brother, which was welcomed with deep appreciation from within the Oval Office.
Thanks, Nancy. Locally, a jackknifed big rig
what the hell are you doing, John?
the Lord's work.
the Lord wants you to spread horse crap all over your mattress?
it's not our place to question His will.
are we clear?
let's cut the chatter, convict.
open on 88!
yo, what's that?
avocado's gear.
he's getting out of the infirmary tonight.
tonight?
so you got plenty of time to bake him a cake.
hey...
I heard you were asking Patterson about Bellick.
said you thought you saw him this morning?
Yeah. I was.
no, it was yesterday.
that's when I saw him.
you sure?
Yeah.
you know, time just sort of blends together up in here.
all right.
close on 88!
what am I supposed to do with this?
pour it in the toilet.
you got C-Note to steal some peroxide from the kitchen so we can clean the toilet?
we got to get all of us into psych ward tonight to access the pipes.
a bunch of cons wearing their prison blues would stick out like a sore thumb.
but the inmates in the psych ward all wear... White.
peroxide acts as a bleach.
camouflage.
just a few more hours now.
looks like we got everything we need...
everything except your brother.
you worry about the suits.
I'll worry about Linc.
could you, uh, give us a couple of minutes?
of course, Mr. President.
you probably know why I'm here.
if I were a betting man,
I have a pretty good idea where I'd lay my chips.
the energy bill, Richard.
why did you change your mind?
you've been saying for months it's so full of pork the damn thing's ready to squeal, and now all of a sudden...
Yes, the bill is flawed, but it's better than doing nothing.
frankly, I find it a little curious that you're here, telling me to veto a bill you voted in favor of.
you're on the way out.
some of us need to think ahead.
actually, I've been doing some thinking ahead as well, Caroline
specifically, about my endorsement.
What?!
I'm considering making a switch, throwing my weight behind Senator Challis.
you can't do that.
can't I?
you are everything that's wrong with politics.
you vote not to legislate change, but to profit.
you run not to make a difference, but to make demands.
you put me on your ticket not because I share your views, but because I didn't share your gender.
so don't take the moral high ground.
we all know how this game is played.
Richard, please, I...
good day, Caroline. Richard!
you know what I got my wife for our anniversary?
what?
a scarf.
well, this is a big one for me.
I had to do something special.
okay, let's get this thing down to the car.
we'll do it all together on three.
ready? One...
Upsie... Oh, no! Oh, no!
put it down, put it down, put it down.
all right, get Scofield up here right away!
it's working.
all right, get 'em out and get 'em dry.
we got to get 'em on under our clothes before tier time, which is in... 45 minutes.
you think everyone else will be ready?
we don't have a choice.
as soon as the gate's open, we go.
we're going to need every second.
open on 40.
Scofield, Pope needs to see you, ASAP.
now?
what for?
a Bar Mitzvah. Let's go.
it's 6: 18, bro.
you can't... Now.
excuse me a minute.
Sara, to what do I owe the pleasure?
I guess to congratulations.
can't believe I had to hear about it on the news.
Oh, the VP thing- well, that's just talk.
is it? Yeah. What was it your mother used to say?
it's always nice to be invited to the dance, even if you don't have the right shoes.
she also used to say,"You're father's a lying bastard," but I figured that was just the booze talking.
you know, it's always nice to see you, Sara.
is there something that you needed, or did you just come by to... Just tell me something.
did you... did you look at the information I gave you from Lincoln Burrows' attorneys? Sweetheart, move on.
I just need to know, did you look at the information?
come on, Sara. Answer me.
I swear, working at Fox River has changed you.
you're always saying you want to make a difference?
at that place? It's too late.
you should be a teacher, so that you can get to these people before they become... Did you look at the information?
I didn't need to.
I supported the findings of the court.
if you have a problem with the verdict, go after them.
but before you do, I suggest you look at the guy's rap sheet the vice presidency before or after you signed his death warrant?
I will not discuss morality with an addict and a thief.
you want to talk reality, Sara?
how many times did I use my influence to keep you and one of your junky boyfriends out of jail?
how many? Was it three, four times?
I swear, Sara, it's funny, you know?
you have no trouble whatsoever with me bending the law...
especially when it's bent in your direction.
grow up.
you talk to that Tweener kid?
Yeah, he says he got his days mixed up, but I don't know. What?
something about the way he said it.
Oh, come on, man, Bellick's just taking a personal.
I don't want to get the guy busted. And if he's not?
I'm just saying, it's 6: 30 and no one's heard from the guy.
we got to tell Pope.
okay. I'll tell him.
did you call the cab for the airport?
no, not yet. Why not?
come on, the flight leaves in an hour.
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm starting to think that us going to Montana might not be a good move.
what are you talking about?
what if you are right, and the smoking gun is in that house?
you think they're just gonna let us walk in there and make a citizen's arrest? Look, Nick,
I don't know what your deal is lately, but I'm getting on that plane with or without you.
I can't let u do that
all this time you were one of them?
who's pulling your leash, Nick?
look at me.
I want you to remember my face when you do whatever the hell it is you're gonna do.
look at me!
you're a coward.
Ah, Scofield's outside, sir.
I want you to try every number we have for Brad Bellick- try his home first.
his mother usually answers.
Mrs. Bellick?
Hi. Uh, one moment, please.
I have Warden Pope here for you.
Mrs. Bellick?
no cause for alarm, no, no.
we just... we haven't seen him, and we were wondering if he might be home under the weather.
so Brad called you when he pulled in this morning?
and he said he was here?
okay, well, uh, thank you, Mrs. Bellick.
we'll keep you posted. I'm sure he's fine.
radio Mack.
have him check the parking lot for Bellick's truck.
if he finds it, have him call me immediately.
this is base.
what's your 20?
I'm pregnant, Fernando.
I'm gonna have your son.
but all I know is that I'm really scared.
I'm really scared to do this alone.
John, it's never too late.
if you'll agree to accept Christ into your heart and turn from your sin, He will forgive you and save you in eternity.
Where's Fibonacci? I'll give you Fibonacci when the time is right.
the time is right now.
no, the time is right when you and I are both standing outside those walls.
I'm gonna get out of here someday, and when I do...
...don't think I won't remember what your front steps look like,
I'm... being shipped back off.
you only got one thing I need.
I've got some bad news, Charles.
your daughter's got esophageal cancer, and she wants to see you while there's still time.
how long does she have?
hospital says a week.
I read somewhere where the actual Taj Mahal appears pink in the morning, milky white in the evening, and golden when the moon shines.
the changes, they say, depict the different emotions of woman.
I can tell you something, if we don't get this thing fixed tonight,
I don't want to know what kind of emotion my wife is gonna have if I walk through that door empty-handed.
it's strange- I mean, it just gave way.
we lifted it up, and the support beam snapped.
what's this?
the support.
the one that holds up that beam.
you took it?
I'm sorry...
but I needed to get back in here.
I- I-I don't understand, why would you...
I'm breaking out.
and you're gonna make sure my brother goes with me.
there's something about this guy.
it's like knows where we're going and what we're thinking.
if that's true, it's just a matter of time before he finds out about the money in Utah, our way into Mexico...
everything.
...have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future...
Caroline, they're taking her in.
of course. I'll keep an eye on her.
I did it, Dad.
just do as you're told.
otherwise there will be consequences that will affect us all.
my dad's an Air Force colonel.
when I told him I was staying in a hotel with a guy that I maybe sorta liked, he lost it.
what are you doing here? Where's Maricruz?
she's with me now.
don't push it.
Hey, Fernando, slow down, man.
I was trying to tell you, the wedding is in Vegas.
which one of them was it?
might be Scofield.
probably gonna find his brother in there, too.
where to, sir?
Utah.
high Way 150 75 miles east of Salt Lake city, Utah
this morning, Authorities in Illinois issued an update on the escaped convicts known until now as the Fox River Eight.
Chicago mob boss John Abruzzi was gunned down outside a Washington D. C. Motel last night after investigators received a tip from an informant.
the other seven escapees are still at large and considered dangerous.
I didn't think Abruzzi'd be the first to go.
I have a feeling we're in for lots of surprises.
they said seven are still out there.
so much for faking our deaths.
I bought us some time - that's what counts.
how much further?
70, 80 miles.
good. Means we should be hitting the Double K Ranch by this afternoon.
or we can keep driving, pick up LJ and hit Panama.
we can't hit Panama!
we can't hit anything! We can't do anything without the money.
we need to find Charles's stash.
I know some other guys who are thinking the same thing.
the money is buried under a silo at the Double K Ranch just outside of Tooele, Utah.
green River, Wyoming
tickets?
Oh. Um, you know, when I was in Cheyenne,
I pulled my ticket out of the bag.
it tore in half, and...
I have no idea what happened to the other part.
they didn't issue you a replacement?
no. The young lady- I think- her name was Sherry
she actually said that this half is okay because the bar code is on it.
well, you really need the whole ticket.
this is exactly what I was trying to avoid.
she said that everything would be fine because...
that's okay. It'll do for now.
but make sure you ask for a replacement when you get to Provo.
I definitely will. Thank you.
it's always something, huh? - Oh, God, I know.
Mack, Colorado 10 miles from the Colorado/Utah Border
I don't want to go home. I wish we could keep driving.
I don't think your Pops will be down for that.
wouldn't it be fun?
we could go to...
Hawaii?
yo, you can't drive to Hawaii.
yo.
I know.
I'm just saying I wish.
no, no. Don't get it. They'll leave.
just let me see who it is.
it's a cop.
no, no, no, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
sorry to disturb you, ma'am.
have you happened to see this person?
last night we got a few phone calls that he was spotted in the area.
so we're going door-to-door.
why are you looking for him?
this guy escaped from prison in Illinois a couple of days ago.
have you seen him?
no.
he doesn't look familiar.
are you sure?
Yeah. I'm sure.
all right.
thanks for your time.
this ain't...
this is not what you think, all right?
look.
listen to me, this...
just... listen.
okay?
all I did was steal a baseball card.
okay? I'm not like those other fools up in there.
I'm gonna go for a walk, okay?
listen... - I'm gonna leave my keys right here.
and when I come back, my car will be gone.
I'm sure, in a few hours, they'll find it somewhere...
abandoned.
wait. Wait.
I wish it could be different.
I have to go.
I think it's "To-ill-uh."
hell of a town.
small is good.
means the ranch'll be easier to find.
all we got to do is get that money and we'll be out of here by nightfall.
FBI Field Office Chicago, Illinois
Oh, sir. Soil test came back from Scofield's crash.
not that you need any more proof, but...
he really went out of his way this time.
what else do you have?
man was violently assaulted in Nebraska by a hitchhiker matching Bagwell's description.
he was headed west on the I-80.
Omaha's putting together a photo lineup.
what do you have on Scofield?
what does anybody have on Scofield?
uh, I've got some results from his hard drive.
the one recovered from the river.
we were able to use the sector editor to restore the master boot.
so from that... I don't care how you did it.
what do you have?
more than half the contents of the buffer.
about 60%.
D. B. Cooper still at large
it looks pretty random.
print it up. All of it. I want it on my desk.
well, guess what?
no listing for a Double K Ranch.
excuse me.
you know where I might find a Double K Ranch?
what you call it?
double K Ranch.
no.
you from around here?
Yeah. Born and raised.
there's no Dole-nothin'.
great. Thank you.
looks like Westmoreland ent his last breath blowing smoke up your ass.
there's one way to find out.
the county keeps property records.
every plot is mapped out with dimensions. It's public record.
but if there is a tax assessor's office here, it's gonna be in there, the Municipal Building.
but there're cops
dispatch.
someone... someone stole my car this morning.
I'm at the Lotus Motel off Interstate 80.
did you see who took it?
no. I went out for a walk and when I came back, it was gone.
this morning?
why didn't you call before?
I don't know
aloha
Chicage, Illinois
Mr. Kellerman.
Mr. Kim.
surprised to see you in Chicago.
just looking for updates.
Sara Tancredi. I'm on it.
is pursuing her the best use of your time?
it is.
she's in contact with Scofield.
I was there when he called yesterday.
we stay with her, she takes us right to him, he takes us to Burrows.
all right.
if you're that confident.
I am.
I'll let the president know.
I contact the president directly.
I'll contact her.
keep me posted.
if you want to restore your dignity, you need to take action.
making amends requires much more than saying "I'm sorry."
it means learning to change.
the apology is just the first step.
the most important thing is that you display honesty, courage and compassion when you extend your apologies.
you need to earn your forgiveness.
we'll talk about it more on Friday.
I've got a great idea.
what's that?
since you are such a fan of lame, store-bought blueberry pie,
I am going to bake you a real pie of your choice tonight.
I can't.
I really don't need to be seeing anyone right now who isn't my therapist.
I've been a hermit lately, too.
my partner Daniel's away on business.
I've been sitting around every night by myself.
kind of pathetic.
I am so sorry.
I thought you meant...
I thought...
the-the pie...
Oh, no.
that's my ego. - No, I was really talking about...
pie? Yeah.
actual blueberries. Like we'd make pie and watch - Fried Green Tomatoes. - I get it, I get it.
I'm the best ex-junkie cook in this town.
thank you. I just... I-I got to clean my apartment.
it's disgusting, and I realize that sounds like an excuse; it's not.
no, no, no, I get it.
um... you do what you got to do.
have a good night.
do you deliver?
next batch.
just... put it on the desk.
does any of this stuff mean anything?
I don't know. Ask me later.
think he's a genius or a whack-job?
I think we answered that question when we assigned a hundred agents to the case.
so why don't you go and get me the rest of it, huh?
does that work for you?
Alackaday.
I just found me an in-betweener.
where you going in such a hurry, huh?
none of your beeswax, yo.
I know where.
same place as every other man who was in that room that night.
they all comin' around here for a big fami reunion at the Ku Klux Ranch.
if they ain't here already.
ain't no country folk in this town ever heard of the Double K Ranch.
seems like you've been misinformed.
indeedy there is a Double K.
it's just a matter of who gets there first, all right?
the stars are going to collide in Tooele, my friend.
you're going to need me on your side.
this ain't Fox River, all right?
I don't need any...
as you can see...
I need you.
get your grubby paws off me, you freak.
I ain't your ditch digger.
I don't need nothing from you.

you might...

Hi.

Really?

Thanks.
this is exactly what we need.
it's a map of every parcel of land.

everything.
Karl Kokosing. Double K.
I don't like the way this guy is looking at us.
Where's 1213?
ms. Sebern, I need to speak with you.
come on, man, we got to roll now.
ms. Sebern.
come on. You got the map?
no
someone else does
someone got here before us. It's the only explanation.
son of a bitch is still alive.
Hey, pretty!
what are you going to do, scream, man?
how the hell...
are you still breathing?
what the hell did you do to your hand?
easy, easy...
I recently had some work done.
Where's the map?!
easy, easy... I don't have it.
well, where is it? I'm telling you,
I don't have it.
I don't have it, all right?! - You were there. We saw you.
it was gone when I got there.
now why don't you keep your pooch away from me.
I'll tell you everything I know.
it's the kid. He has it.
I saw him this morning and I needed some help.
we made a deal, all right?
he said that he would dig.
I told him where we could get a map.
what kid?
what kid?
illinois Goverrnor's Residence Chicago, Illinois
the best thing to do is nothing.
that's how I'm going to get the U. S. Senate to confirm my Vice President, do nothing?
shows them you can do the job.
it's my daughter.
sir, we need to talk about your daughter.
what about her?
well, the media is all over this Fox River situation.
we think it would be best if you could distance yourself from her...
if I hear this one more time...
I paid her bail, I walked away.
I have distanced myself.
give me a minute.
Hey, Dad, it's me.
um, when you get a chance,
I really need to talk to you about something.
um, actually a lot of things.
uh, the most important one is that, um...
I owe you an apology.
I, uh, I realize that I've made things difficult for you lately... um...
...and I want to take responsibility for that.
call me back. Bye.
Hi.
I know I'm early, but I brought dinner. Come on in.
you're not a vegetarian, are you? No.
just shut that behind you.
you mind if I check my e-mail?
no, not at all. - Here.
Oh, you're so kind. Thank you. - Absolutely.
authorized personnel access only
do you happen to have a pen handy?
Yeah.
thank you so much. I'm so sorry to bother you.
not at all. Look, I have a little pencil and a pad.
thank you.
sir?
Yeah.
there's no Sherry in Cheyenne.
your ticket is not valid for travel.
Oh, well, hold on now.
tha-that can't be right. That can't be right.
excuse me for a second. Sure.
all right now, listen, brother.
I'm gonna give it to you straight.
listen, listen, I- I'm broke, okay?
that's the truth.
and I just ran into some trouble a while back and...
I'm just really trying to pull it I together now.
you understand?
you can tell it all to the authorities in about five minutes.
Oh, come on, brother.
we don't have to get the authorities... Oh, it's too late.
they're already waiting at the next stop.
these guys here, they're gonna sit with you until we stop.
I understand. I understand.
Hey!
Hey, you can't go in there!
okay, we've got a confirmed sighting on Franklin.
jumped out of a moving train in Preston, Idaho.
what is a black man from Chicago doing in Idaho?
he's got to be lost.
Franklin's in Preston, Idaho.
Bagwell's in Nebraska.
and both men have never been across the Mississippi.
visiting friends and family? I don't think so.
and not...
south of the border.
they're due west and we need to know...
why.
out.
what's going on, friends?
where did you say Tweener was headed?
up on the main drag. He was supposed to find a shovel.
in.
no.
no, no, no.
in!
you coming back, right?
you coming back!
Yep.
Hey, you guys!
Hey!
come on, man, I'm gonna help you here!
I was on my ATV, and I was hauling ass.
I was right on her tail, and I pulled out my gun and blam!
that bitch treed herself, and I brought her down in one shot.
What'd she weigh?
least a hunny.
maybe one-ten.
come on out and see us if you want.
it's gonna be a good time.
Yeah, I just might do that.
Hey, now, what you digging?
some stuff in my grandpa's yard.
we got a bigger one in the back if you're going deep.
no, this will do.
damn it if I don't know you from somewhere.
maybe I know your grandpa.
I doubt it, man.
he moved here, like, a month ago, so...
what's his name?
his name's Grandpa.
a'ight? Look, man, can you just ring this up?
I gotta get out of here.
sure thing, Fella.
I'll ring it up.
I'll ring it right now.
I know where I seen you on the TV.
you're one of them Fox River boys.
you got it wrong, man.
no, I think I got it right.
we're closed!
sorry, bud.
closing up early today.
hold on.
stay right there.
you're going down, jus your buddy, you son of a...
Where's the kid?
Where's the kid?!
he's back here.
get up.
come on, tough guy.
let's go.
Las Vegas, Nevada
baby, open up.
it's me. It's me, okay?
Fernando, what are you doing here?
I... - You can't be here.
I know, Theresa. I just got...
Where's your sister? I need to see Maricruz.
she's getting her picture taken with my mom and dad.
the wedding's at 2: 30. I need to see her now.
you have to go.
she's the mother of my kid, Theresa.
please.
you don't want her to marry Hector, do you? Do you?
I'll go see if I can go get her.
wait in here.
okay.
Lance, I got a question for you.
yes?
do you know who I am?
I happened to see the news last night, yes.
Hey, I don't care.
I've got some skeletons in my closet, too.
one of them wears a dress.
thank you.
I appreciate your lack of judgment.
from what I can tell, you didn't do anything wrong, but it's none of my business.
and you don't need to talk about it.
the whole thing just...
I never meant for it to happen.
okay, you do not need to answer this question.
hmm?
but were you and that guy, like, uh...
you're right, I don't want to talk about it.
you done?
Yeah.
does it worry you that he's out there?
give me one second.
dad.
Sara, hi.
I got your message.
should we... Please, come in.
uh, Lance, this is, uh, my father Frank.
how do you do?
uh, Dad, this is my friend Lance.
pleasure to meet you, sir. I voted for you.
well, thank you. I appreciate that.
Sara, I can take off.
no, no need.
it'll only take a minute.
why don't you step into my office and you make yourself at home.
sure.
so, uh...
so, in my program, um...
we've been talking a lot about making amends, and I've been thinking a lot about, um...
about some of the choices I've made lately, and I know that that affects you.
and, uh...
and I... I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry.
you don't have to say you're sorry.
Yeah, I do.
and it must be hard to understand why I did it.
um, I had no idea that I was putting these guys back out on the street.
I thought I was saving the life of an innocent man and...
and I know that you didn't read the information I gave you on Lincoln Burrows, but he is innocent and...
a lot of the people involved right now are dead.
I'm sorry.
this isn't why I called you.
I'm fine...
but I'm scared.
I'm gonna help you through this.
we're gonna get through this together.
thank you.
I promise.
we ran that trace you requested.
What'd you get?
the line is disconnected.
whose was it?
apparently, no one's.
what does that mean?
it's been out of service for 17 years.
where is she?
Oh, calm down. Calm down.
she's gonna come down and talk to you.
she's on her way down right now.
you and I got history.
we're family.
and out of respect for that,
I'm gonna let her make her own decision.
I'm not leaving without her.
that's for Maricruz to decide.
you've been filling her head with all this crap.
she's a smart girl.
I personally don't think she's gonna want to live her life on the run, but we'll see.
you know, she doesn't love you. - Yeah, I don't want to get into that right now.
you're not raising my kid.
that don't sound good, cuz.
baby!
Mari. You have to go.
Wh-where is she? Please, Fernando, they're coming!
did you tell her I was here? Did you?!
I'll be right down.
Mr. Mahone.
where are they?
had a hard time getting my hands on these.
it'd be easier to go to a doctor, tell him you need something to calm your nerves.
doctors take notes. That's why I have a deal with you.
the way things been going, I thought maybe our deal was over.
you don't ask me about Shales no more.
that part of our deal is over.
I no longer need an informant on the case.
thought th's all you cared about was finding him.
you can't get them all.
if you want, I can keep an ear out on the street.
midazolam. 1, 500 milligrams every 30 days.
that's all I want from you.
we understand each other?
you gonna pay me for it?
right there.
what are you doing here?
we had to come for you, buddy.
how'd you know?
hand over the map.
what? - The map.
hand it over.
he told you I have it?
we are going to sort this out right now.
tell me that's not what I know it is.
it is.
but don't worry, before I destroyed it
I committed it to my photographic memory.
coming from a compulsive liar,
I find that a little hard to believe.
I'd tattooed it to my body but I didn't have the time.
whenever you strip search a lifer, you should always check his coin purse.
tell us where the money is.
now let's not dissolve into threats, all right?
I'm going to take the high road here and suggest a mutually beneficial arrangement.
I have the information, you have the manual requirements necessary to unearth Westmoreland's buried booty.
we're partners.
and why is that?
cause as of this moment,
I'm your map.
so then, yo, we split it four ways, right?
wrong. Get in.
you're not worth 1. 5.
get in - Ok
cache County, Utah
excuse me. Can I help you?
Oh. Yeah.
sorry, yeah. Uh... whoo!
it's hot.
I was really wondering how much you selling your RV for.
probably out of your price range.
come on, give me a shot.
$40, 000.
for sale
look, I tell you what.
I'll be back in a couple days, okay?
I can't hold it for you.
I said I'll be back.
with cash.
mesquite Nevada 1 mile from the Navada/Utah Border
nice bike.
the wedding's at 2: 30, Fernando.
we just got confirmation on Fernando Sucre
he was in Las Vegas around 2: 00.
then a gas station attendant spotted a guy on a bike matching his description in Mesquite...
an hour later.
out west, just like Bagwell and Franklin.
Yeah, but he was heading east.
and Bagwell's in Nebraska on I-80 heading west.
and Franklin's train was heading west, but he jumped off to the...
so...
you know D. B. Cooper?
Yeah, yeah, the hijacker. - Hijacker.
but he was never found. - Yeah, but he's got to be somewhere, right, because someone hijacked that plane in Portland and jumped out over the Pacific Northwest.
and someone was arrested two days later in Bisbee, Arizona.
not the same guy. - Same guy.
same guy who was treated for a broken knee in a free clinic somewhere around Salt Lake City.
same guy whose Nova blew a head gasket ten miles short of the border.
same guy who almost got away with a stolen car, but he ran a woman down in Bisbee.
vehicular Manslaughter.
arrested and booked as Charles Westmoreland.
but he didn't have the money on him.
which means...
he got rid of it somewhere along the way.
wait, wait, this is fact? You figured all this out?
no. Scofield did.
that's why he was bringing the old man along.
the money's in Utah.
and they're all going to get it.
you know, in, uh, Thailand they got a black market where you can get any kind of surgery you need, even a hand transplant.
you're sick, you know that. - Keep going.
the turnoff's just up here somewhere.
before or after Sheep Road?
what's the matter, Theodore, did you forget?
how could I forget a road called Sheep?
it's after.
don't you feel all warm inside now that we're working together?
we aren't working together.
you're just here to lend a hand.
now, slow down.
that was it, that little bitty road right back there.
how far is it from here?
quarter mile if I remember the scale properly.
start walking.
private Property
Yeah, I'm almost ready.
what time did you say the flight was?
1899/12/31 0: 08: 00
listen, I hope you get this nomination more than anyone, but...
be prepared.
this Burrows thing may steamroll.
well, we'll wait it out, just like you said.
problem is too many headlines.
his lawyer Nick Savrinn's already dead.
his kid's awaiting trial for double homicide.
and now his lead counsel is classified as missing.
well, is she missing or is she dead?
I just thought you should know before you go to Washington.
Bruce, is there something connecting all of this?
it's probably best you don't ask a whole lot of questions.
where now?
right up there.
the hill borders the property.
KK's on the other side.
first thing I'm gonna do with the money?
buy new shoes.
second thing: tacos.
third thing: ice cold beer.
fourth thing: a little toothpaste.
agent Mahone, your car's out front, sir.
the flight to Utah leaves in an hour.
I'll be there. Thank you.
ninth thing: a shower.
tenth thing: a good night's sleep.
a nice hotel. Clean sheets.
look, stakes marking the property line.
should be dead ahead.
can you see the silo?
the bastards built over it.
it's gone.
I got nothing against you, kid.
what are you doing, man?
but they do.
your pal Manche told me all about your little treasure hunt for Westmoreland's stash.
we're going to Utah.
fooled you.
hands behind your back.
make yourself at home. Sure.
your father got a call from the White House.
they withdrew his nomination.
according to them, his confirmation was going to be a problem.
my father is not a suicidal man.
governor Tancredi, not part of our plan.
anyone who knows anything has got to be dealt with.
if someone's a liability, they go.
Tancredi was becoming a liability.
so was his daughter.
wait, what?
Burrows is scheduled to be released from the Klipton Detention Center in Kingman, Arizona tomorrow morning.
LJ is out there; I'm going to get him.
take care.
God bless you and your wrinkled old sack.
it's all here.
Where's Sucre?
drop the bag.
no one's going anywhere.
what the hell are you doing, man?
whatever it is you want... - I want the money, all of it.
what, are you robbing us?
the money was never yours to begin with.
this is about business.
$5 million worth of business.
so this is how it's going to go down, huh?
after everything.
once a thief, always a thief.
you just figuring that out?
the backpack.
now!
don't do this, buddy.
yo, take a look around you, papi.
it's three of us, it's one of you; you are outnumbered, man, and we will come after you.
it'll be the last thing you do, my brother.
what, are you going to shoot at all of us?
probably not.
but I will get two.
now...
which two is it going to be?
that's what I thought.
I don't believe this.
we have come all this way and done all of this work.
thought you was compadres, tattoo?
so what are we going to do now, man?
the police are going to be here any second.
ain't no way I'm letting that- that dunderpate ride off with five...
it's your choice.
it's all right.
all right, I'm going to give you this, and, uh...
you should be able to cut yourself free in about an hour.
so what's the plan, man?
well, you can do what you want.
I let that psychopath t-bag loose once.
I'm not going to do it again.
make a nice little present for the police when they get here.
where is he?
I don't know, man, look, I got to, I got to go.
uh, good luck.
they're going to get you.
ms. Tancredi.
I didn't mean to startle you.
what the hell are you doing in my house?
no reason to be frightened.
I used to work with your father.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
my father didn't commit suicide.
what are you doing?
making sure it doesn't look like I did!
people will ask questions if the day the governor was found killing himself, his daughter is found dead in what looks like a struggle.
well, then.
what if they don't find her?
in an apparent attempt to avoid jail time, the governor's daughter skips bail and disappears.
we're talking about your last minutes, Ms. Tancredi.
please don't do this.
that stuff on that table is premium.
it's grade "A."
do yourself a favor, go out on a high.
look, I'm begging you here.
one last ride.
Oh, god!
what?
too much?
you were great.
this thing is freaking heavy, dude.
won't be so bad after we split it up.
three ways: Me, you and Linc. Four.
we're going to send a share to Charles's daughter, with her father's love, just like we promised.
what about C-Note?
I feel kind of bad about the whole thing.
there's no way to know if we could trust him.
once we get down to Panama, we'll send something up to his family, make sure he's taken care of.
five million dollars.
I can't believe I'm going to be...
where the hell is the money?
where the hell is the money?
the backpack...
now!
Kingman, Arizona
Mr. Burrows?
merry christmas from the state.
here's a list of options available to you.
places to stay, businesses that are more open to hiring men out of the correctional system.
any questions you might have about your immediate future?
no.
well, the number on there is toll-free.
if you encounter any problems, you can call there 24-7.
Thanks.
wait a second. You know what?
why don't you tell me where you need to go, and I'll make sure you get there.
you know, I think I'll be all right.
you sure? Yeah.
thank you.
kid didn't bite.
he's on foot. - All right.
have your men follow. Remember, it's the father we want.
we can't go back.
you said it, without the money, we're screwed.
we can't... just let me think.
maybe it's still back... - Just let me think! Let me think.
maybe it's still back at the house.
the money's not back at the house unless T-Bag is.
he must've switched the packs.
wh-what do we do...
what do we do now?
we still got the five grand we took when we pocketed the money.
it's not gonna be five million, but it might be enough to get us where we're going.
all units be advised.
escaped convicts from fox river have been positively ID'd at 1131 monterey lane.
we have dogs being dispatched to the location.
I want every road in or out of town blocked off.
I don't care if it's on wheels, rails or hooves.
I want it stopped and searched.
I thought you said we would have a head start.
it was the gunshot, buddy.
one of the neighbors must've heard.
how fast can that thing go?
I don't know. Both of us, it could probably...
we're never gonna get out of here on the roads.
we need to find another way.
Chicago, Illinois FBI Filed Office
he's in your office.
who let him in?
I can't believe they're calling me back here when my escapees are out there.
I want to know who this guy is.
said his name was Sullins.
son of a bitch.
let me know if anything breaks on the convicts.
Alex. Thanks for coming in.
you want to tell me why internal affairs is pulling me out of the field in the middle of a manhunt?
it's been a while since we've had a sit-down, hasn't it?
not since the Shales escape, am I right?
Yeah, yeah. What's going on, Richard?
well...
that's precisely what I'm here to find out.
and you're not getting out of here until I do.
lyman, Wyoming
Oh, my god. Civilization.
what can I get for you boys?
you tell me.
two waters, then.
and the use of your phone, if you'd be so kind.
don't worry, it's a local call.
first thing I do, we get home: Clean underwear.
then what?
I guess go back to that liquor store, beg for my job back.
we had it.
we were so close.
I can still taste that money right there in the back of my throat.
well, nothing that a couple of Keystones, a hungry man salisbury steak dinner and a night in front of the TV won't take care of.
Hey, mom, it's Brad.
Hey, listen, me and Roy, we ran into some car trouble and...
we were wondering if you could come pick us up.
I don't know, hold on.
what the hell town is this?
thought you said this was a local call.
Hey, Bradley, check this out. Wait, mom.
these individuals were reportedly the prisoners who escaped from the fox river penitentiary in Illinois just a couple of days ago.
what were they doing all the way out here in Tooele, Utah?
well, Jeanette Owens, whose garage they dug up, has her own theory.
they pretended that they were some kind of workers from the power company, and that they had made a mistake and they'd have to do some digging.
Hey, mom, on second thought, uh, can you wire us some extra scratch?
turns out, we ain't done yet.
hello.
Bruce, I need your help.
Bruce, my father didn't commit suicide, okay?
okay, just calm down. Where are you?
he was looking into the Burrows case and I think that he found something that they didn't want him to know.
and now, I think that they think that I know it, too.
all right, I want you to listen to me.
I'm gonna send someone over to pick you up.
I'll bring you back here, and we'll sort all of this out, I promise.
just tell me where you are.
uh, I don't know, I'm at a pay phone on...
third and Harper.
do you have your cell in case I need to reach you?
uh, I do, but I-I thought it would be tapped.
I don't know.
all right, someone's on their way.
just stay right where you are.
thank you.
I'll give you 80 bucks for them.
come on, man, they're worth...
worth a lot more to the person they actually belong to.
these are ladies clubs, doctor.
I'm guessing they're hotter than a monkey's jockstrap.
80 bucks.
throw in the cooler, and you got a deal.
we got to lose the bike.
no way.
the roads are sealed.
it's the only way we're gonna make it out of here.
I can't, bro. I promised Petey...
you're not getting that thing across the river.
and every minute we spend trying is a minute we don't have, okay?
I'm sorry.
we got to move.
I've heard about these kinds of places.
they got leeches, you know.
I'll take the leeches in here over the handcuffs back there.
I don't know, papi.
sort of depends on where the leech leeches, you know what I'm saying?
stop kidding around.
are you all right, buddy?
I can't... I can't move!
you feel like you broke anything?
no, I don't think so.
can you get it? Can you get it off me?
this thing's not going anywhere.
I'm gonna check your foot.
I'm sorry, buddy.
it's stuck.
you, call 911.
Kelli, my name is Sara. I'm a doctor.
you're gonna be okay. Can you hear me?
you'll be all right. Take some deep breaths and...
it's gonna be okay, right?
I mean, if you can get eight people out of prison, you can get my puerto rican ass out of this, right?
can't you?
come on!
damn it!
do you hear that?
I know that sound.
there's a dam up river.
it's a signal.
it means they're opening the locks.
that means the water level's gonna rise, and when it does, the log will just float right off.
yeah?
canine units at the scene have multiple scents and are spreading out into the field.
trail's fresh. These guys can't have gotten very far.
there were six cons back at that house.
they'll be tracking us in every direction.
it'll take an hour just to make it over this far, and by that time, the water level will rise, we'll be long gone.
are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm sure.
ask any of the 20 cops there, John Abruzzi was armed.
John Abruzzi drew his weapon...
he never should have been allowed to get that far.
Richard, let's be clear.
if you knew how things needed to be handled in a manhunt, you'd be out there running one instead of hamstringing the men that are.
the FBI's primary objective in investigating fugitive matters is to affect the swift location and capture of the fugitives.
you have two dead bodies, Alex.
I've got two dead felons, Richard.
now, maybe that doesn't play well from a public relations standpoint, but from a public safety standpoint, Abruzzi and Apolskis were by the book.
shooting of an unarmed kid at point-blank range is by the book?
come on.
incident report, David "Tweener" Apolskis.
you know, I'm curious, was he cuffed during transport?
says in here he somehow managed to grab your primary weapon.
you carry that in a shoulder holster? - Hip.
left, right? Right, left?
left. Left.
I'm sorry, I get confused sometimes.
so just so I've got this right, you were driving along alone with a cuffed prisoner, and somehow he reaches forward across your chest and grabs your weapon.
it's too bad you didn't react that quickly with Apolskis.
maybe he'd still be alive.
there's a plan to make all of this right
what does an origami bird have to do with any of this?
michael Scofield sent it to her.
and since your brilliant plan to eliminate Sara Tancredi from the equation failed so completely
I wouldn't say it failed completely at all. There's a dead woman in a phone booth.
civilian.
a certain number of bodies you can sweep under the rug.
president's rug is getting so full, you can hardly stand on it.
so what do you suggest we should do?
you ever go fishing, Bill? Just make your point.
there's two ways to catch a fish.
you cast out a big net and hope you get what you're looking for.
or you choose the right bait and guarantee that you do.
it's a simple strategy, plays across the board.
LJ will lead us to Burrows.
Sara will lead us to Scofield.
and how do you intend to follow Sara, when the only lead you've got is an origami bird with an out of service phone number?
maybe it's not a phone number.
what do you have?
junior's on the move, but still no sign of Burrows.
sir, the guy's in hiding, maybe he doesn't even know his kid's out.
the cop that was held hostage in Utah has Burrows splitting off from the rest of the group just after word of LJ's release hit the wire.
he knows.
now if we want to know for sure if he's there, we need to do something to draw him out.
Hey, you mind sparing some change?
no.
come on.
no, I'm all tapped out. You got something.
I'll take whatever you got.
look, seriously, I just got out of lock-up.
sorry.
I see, you think you're better than me, huh?
I don't think I'm better than you.
yo, where you running, little man?
I'm not running anywhere.
this isn't how it's supposed to go.
the whole reason I went along with the break was to have a life with Maricruz and my baby.
and now what?
get some two-bit job?
always be looking over my shoulder?
what kind of life is that?
you can come with me and Linc.
to Panama.
start over.
the longer you stay here, the more chance there is you'll never make it to Panama.
you've got other people to think about.
your brother, your nephew.
she's meeting you down there, isn't she?
I don't know.
we never talked about it.
but you're hoping.
just give it a rest, will you.
the dogs are locked in. We've got two trails merging.
they were definitely here.
they've headed east towards drucker ranch. They've gone off-road.
any additional units, we need to setup a one-mile perimeter and then start closing in.
it's getting deeper.
so how come this freaking thing ain't moving yet?
let me check
you all right?
Hey, Michael...
I understand if you have to keep going, you know.
don't say that. I'm not going anywhere.
no, but, look, just think about it. You know, if I leave you drown.
no, I know, but just...
the water level's getting higher, Sucre.
how many seconds can you hold your breath?
that's how long you've got to live if I take off.
how long do you have if you stay?
how long till the dogs lead the cops here?
what you're suggesting is not an option.
look, I ain't trying to be a hero or nothing.
we both know there are only two things that can happen now.
leave me here...
or we both get caught.
I know we said not to use this number, but I just needed to know you were okay.
my driver said he went to pick you up and the place was a crime scene.
Yeah, the woman that he saw, the woman by the pay phone, that was supposed to be me.
and-and I had to leave her there. I didn't know what to do.
Bruce, who are these people?
they knew exactly where I was going to be standing.
they knew where I was going to be...
it was you.
what are you talking about, Sara?
I just need to know where you are. Oh, my god.
city Memorial Hospital Emergency
excuse me, we'd like to check on a friend of ours, LJ Burrows?
he's getting some stitches.
we just want to make sure he's all right.
and you can see him when he's through.
it's policy.
you don't get it.
I get that that kid defended himself.
you going to tell us why you attacked him in the first place?
I told you man.
I know, some guy paid you. Some guy paid me to do it.
excuse me. Fbi.
what do you mean somebody paid you?
what the hell does it sound like, man?
some dude gave me 50 bucks to give the kid a beat down.
it's Burrows. He's here.
how you feeling, son?
dad?
we got to move.
well, there's not much you can do, you know.
excuse me, ladies.
I need to ask you a few questions.
I'm on the, uh, follow-up investigation team.
excuse me.
uh, we're just curious.
did you see if the convicts actually found what they were digging for?
no. But sure sounded like they did.
the spaniard, he took off with one of my daughter's camping packs and he left the other ones in a real tizzy.
sounded like he screwed 'em over something fierce.
and-and they just let him leave?
well, they weren't happy about it, but, yeah.
he took off on his motorbike, and then they left a few minutes later.
together? No.
the pretty one and the black fellow, they left first, and then that dirty southerner...
he snuck out the back.
but he was moving kind of slow, you know, the weight of that backpack and that disability that...
wait a minute, he had a backpack, too?
Yes.
he came back in and slipped this into my brassiere on his way out.
he said it was to cover the damages.
um, we're going to need to keep this as evidence.
thank you for your time.
get the car

and what exactly are you looking for?
a pattern.
a code.
anything.

what? What are you trying to tell me, Michael?
they say...
people come into your life for a reason.
maybe my reason was to help you get out of Fox River.
you know, to help you save your brother.
no.
it's okay, papi.
let me go.
we're a quarter mile up the river below the dam.
it's now or never, Michael.
I want you to hold your breath. Okay?
Why? Just do it.
I'll be right back, I promise.
what the hell are you doing?
all units to the river.
I want you to go under.
and then stick your arm up, above the water, high.
all right.
and then when you start running out of air, wave it back and forth so I can see it.
and I'll come back and get you. Okay?
all right, give me your hand.
come on.
come on!
talk to me.
well, there is one possibility, but it's almost too rudimentary.
we know we're not looking at a phone number, but maybe we're not looking at numbers at all.
what's important are the letters that correspond to that number.
three dots, third letter
three possibilities per number.
that's thousands of letter combinations.
but only one of them's going to be right.
rendezvous pendextoup
question is where.
#1799 a real beauty
Hey.
what are you in the market for?
four wheels and a gas pedal.
Hey, Petey. Uh, it's me.
uh, listen, I-I got something to tell you.
Yeah, well, I was wondering when you were gonna call.
Yeah, um, a-a lot has come down since we last talked, and, uh...
gee, I know, I heard.
you ruined it.
Yeah.
you heard already?
well, brother, everybody's heard, man, and let me tell you something, man.
Hector is pissed.
what does Hector have to do with it?
it was his wedding.
wait, man.
what are you talking about? - Your bike.
what are you talking about? - The wedding.
what about the wedding?
well, you know the part where, uh, you say, "I do"?
Maricruz said, "I don't."
she did?
left homeboy standing at the altar holding his spam in his hand, if you know what I'm saying.
what were you telling me about my bike?
all right.
I'll go get your keys.
I got a couple stops to make.
first is this place called Blanding.
then we'll meet up with Lincoln in a couple days.
I can't go.
she said no, papi.
Maricruz told that son of A...
she told him no.
can you believe that?
that's great. - I know.
now, I just...
no. Go on. Get your girl.
what about Panama? We said that we were gonna...
some other time. Panama's not going to go anywhere.
this is, uh, in case you run into trouble down the road.
in the river...
I told you to leave me behind.
Yeah, well, I tried, but, uh, then I got tangled up in the rope, so...
okay, here you go.
Thanks, and, uh, we'll need another car.
do you really think the diaper sniper got all of it?
only one way to find out.
if you were Bagwell, and you just got your hands on $5 million, where would you go?
you think you're the only one who feels betrayed?
I'm gonna get out of here some day.
and when I do, don't think I won't remember what your front steps look like.
let me get this straight.
you-you paid that Meth-Head to whoop my ass?
Yup.
feds were waiting for me to come get you. It was the only way.
it worked, didn't it?
Yeah, it got me four stitches.
adds character.
here, take that.
there's some ice in there. Put it on the eye.
keep the swelling down.
I've been in a few fights in my day, too.
too many.
rendezvous sundown/hot
there's one more bird.
clean it.
every surface, like she never came home.
you know, waiting for your flight from Utah, I had a little extra time for due diligence, so I decided to dig a little deeper on your history, or rather lack of one.
starts off simple enough.
poor family. Mom leaves, cites spousal abuse.
somehow your dad holds onto custody, and by the look of these pediatric meds, he beats you like a harp seal for the next four years.
big shock - poor, abused kid, not a lot of options - he joins the military.
will there be any actual questions, or is this just a show-and-tell?
okay, I got one.
how does a guy go from infantry grunt with less than stellar marks to the gulf 1, special ops, to the federal bureau of investigations, leading the largest manhunt this country's ever seen?
I have all these dots.
and there's just no way to connect them.
looks like you need to work on your clearance level...Dick.
or maybe I just work on you.
you want to do this?
I will chain you to this desk until I get some answers I cannot fertilize my lawn with.
you sure you want to do this?
I know what they tell you to do overseas, Alex, and let me make it perfectly clear - we do not do it on American soil.
sir, uh, there's a phone call for you.
I'll take it later.
uh, sir, you're gonna want to take this now.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
I, uh...
I'm with him now.
Yes, sir.
okay.
where you going, Rick?
I thought we were really starting to get somewhere.
let's go.
you got something for me?
open it.
the numbers correlate to the letters on a phone.
only on this one, none of the possible combinations make sense.
we think it's a location, a rendezvous point for Michael Scofield.
you find it, you find him.
you know, you could have gotten me out of there sooner.
you know, even we have to go through certain channels to make things appear on the up-and-up.
you know all about that, don't you, Alex?
keeping up appearances.
good.
I was just making sure that we're still clear on the directive of this manhunt.
you know, I understand the, uh, reasoning behind Burrows and Scofield, but these other men - criminals that they may be
there's nothing in their profiles to suggest... you've been hired to do a job.
the reasoning does not concern you.
don't ask any questions about us, and maybe we'll continue to make sure no one asks any questions about you.
are we clear?
they all die.
they all die.
listen, why don't I just give you half the money we call it a day?
all right, 60/40.
you thieving son of a bitch.
you better get down on your knees and pray to god that I don't find you.
because if I do, mark my words, I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.
Mr. Bellick? - Yeah?
do you mind answering a few more questions?
we have a lead as to where burroughs will be meeting up with his brother.
it's a place he referred to as "bolshoi booze."
they're numbers.
plug 'em into your gps they'll take you to a spot in the new mexico desert.
daddy! - Hey, baby, you ready to go?
go, go, go, go, go!
what do we do now?
she told you anything? - Not yet.
then kill her. - Well, she knows something.
you disobey me, you are done! Put her in the ground, paul!
you're going to die, and all you had to do was tell me what your father gave you.
go to hell.
go!
the plane's gonna stop at the seven-mile marker, route 4 at sunset.
we got to go. - I brought someone.
dad?
we met before.
it was you.
go easy, son.
stay away from me.
what the hell's going on? - I know him.
what do you mean you know him? That's impossible.
I know him. I know this man!
Michael... - Maybe that's far enough.
this doesn't concern you.
what the hell's going on, dad?
after mom died...
you were in juvie.
they put me with this...
this foster father down on pershing avenue.
he punished me, locked me up.
if you leave someone alone in the dark for that long, their eyes start to adjust.
you start to see things, no matter how small, because if they exist, they can help you.
help you do the only thing you want to do...
when you're alone in the dark:
get out.
I've used just about every lure that you could use.
most of them, you need to be an expert to use.
this moto lure's a little different.
everybody, I mean everybody, can fish with it.
and you're gonna catch bigger fish, you're gonna catch more fish.
it even works in weedy areas where most top-water lures won't work.
take a look at this baby.
this thing looks like a real minnow.
this is one very cool bait.
I have never sn anything quite like this.
even if you've bought lures off of tv in the past and been disappointed
and believe me, I know how you feel
Hey. - Sorry, man. I thought you'd left.
no, still here. Here I am.
Yeah, it's just that a couple of guests are complaining about the volume of your tv.
Oh, sorry, I fell asleep.
I must have hit the remote. I'll take care of it.
Thanks. Sorry. Thanks. Great.
um, so could you do that for me now, please, so it's taken care of?
Yeah. Thanks.
taken care of .
is, uh, everything okay in your bathroom?
excuse me?
your bathroom. There's a noise coming from it.
Yeah, my daughter thinks bath time is playtime.
I will clean it up. Scout's honor. Sorry.
all right. Have a nice day.
Yeah, you, too.
Michael, please wait. - He did this to you?
he did this to you?
he did this to you?
how could you do that to another human being with your own hands?
it's okay. You're safe now.
he's not going to hurt you anymore.
come on.
come with me and don't look back.
it's gonna be all right.
six months I was in that place.
where were you?
how long did you know?
I found you as soon as I could. The state kept moving you around.
then you went away again, right?
you don't think it killed me to leave you like that?
to leave in the first place?
since the beginning, I was the problem. Since day one.
your lives are what they are because of me.
Yes, linc told me about the company.
apparently, you were some kind of analyst. That's the job you chose over your family.
I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought I was protecting you.
from what, dad, from who?
the company had enemies! I was important to the company.
I became a target. Easiest way to get to me would be to get to you!
I left as soon as I realized how corrupt it all was. How they were buying the government...
you could have come back at any time! - No, I couldn't!
Michael, turning on the company put me and you at even greater risk.
I had to stay away.
we were your sons.
and you still are, michael.
we can fix this.
I came back so that we could fix this.
this can never be fixed.
there's a tape.
gives us everything we need.
Linc will be set free if we find it.
you're not gonna believe who he thinks has it.
who?
Yes, uh, tall and slender, brown hair, brown eyes.
she'd be pretty banged up.
no one matching that description has been brought into the er.
no report on sara tancredi?
she's dead. I'm dealing with the body right now.
you must be relieved that it's over.
Yeah. Yeah, I got to go.
one more thing: Confirmation.
I need a photo of the body before disposal.
uh, take one with your phone and send it to me and I'll...
bill not a good time right now, all right?
Paul, take a breath, then take the picture.
I'm waiting.
the trail led to a very dangerous place.
now, arvid knew that,
but he held tightly onto the dragon's leash anyway, "as the creature ran into the everdark forest, pulling the young boy behind him."
why didn't he just let go of the leash?
well, because he loved the dragon.
now, when you love someone, you'll do anything to hold onto them.
anything to keep them safe and happy.
is that why we're camping?
Yep. So we can all be together.
I'm happy.
I'm happy, too.
here you go.
well, it's all working out, huh?
don't say that.
you know, this moment, right here, right now, it's all worth it.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Tribune. KANSAS
that's old.
the kids are bigger now.
sorry. I was just...
getting bored out of your wits 'cause you been waiting so long.
really sorry about all this.
we don't get a whole bunch of homicides out here, and, well, we're trying to play catch-up.
please, have a seat.
I'm real sorry about your friend.
sick world out there.
ain't that the truth?
so you guys out here in kansas together?
Yeah. That's right.
doing what?
well, you know, just seeing the sights.
you left chicago to see the sights in tribune, kansas?
last time I checked, a man could go where he wanted.
Mr. Bellick...
I don't really care what you were doing out here.
we're both in law enforcement. We can each sniff out a perp like a hot fart.
pardon my french.
we both know you're not a criminal, so...
I don't care if you boys were out here whoopin' it without your wives or...
going brokeback.
what?
hell, no.
my point is, I don't care what you were doing.
I just need to know where you were doing it and who you might have crossed paths with so
I can find out who carved up Mr. Geary.
geary and I got a lead that one of the fox river eight was in town.
which one?
the man who did all those horrible things to those teenagers?
that's him.
we were going to bring him in for the reward money, but we couldn't get a handle on him.
geary and I split up, figured we didn't have a shot, but...
but what?
well, after what happened, I'm starting to think maybe geary ran into ol' bagwell after all.
right here in tribune?
now, brad, do you think you could answer some questions that might help us track theodore bagwell?
I'd be indebted.
I'll do whatever I can to help you nail that son of a bitch.
you think sara has this tape?
government does.
I just saw her yesterday. If she does have anything, she doesn't know.
well, where is she now?
I don't know.
any way you can get in touch with her?
we brought cell phones. I could call her.
please, please, please, bro, call her from panama.
please.
we got less than two hours. I got to make the flight.
what?
run. Run!
Where's this car you keep talking about?
it's over the ridge. - Give me that.
you guys head for the car! Go!
come on!
go!
go back for him!
dad! Go!
come on, dad
we made it!
son of a bitch! We made it!
Sucre, get us to a hospital.
out here? Where the hell am I going to find...?
just get us to a hospital, please!
okay.
don't worry. You're going to make it.
it's bile.
he got me clean through.
you're going to be okay! Just...
hold on.
listen to me, both of you.
I'm sorry.
I wish I had never left.
don't talk, don't talk. Just breathe.
okay, so do you want a pb & b?
not really. My tummy hurts.
Where's her knapsack?
her what?
knapsack. Her medicine's in it.
I don't know, baby. I just grabbed her and ran.
she needs that medicine. She can't go two days without it.
Yeah, I know. I'm her father, all right?
where is it?
baby. Baby, look. Calm down.
what are you looking for?
just tell me what it is, and I'll go ahead and get it, okay?
her prescription.
it's a backup. I keep an extra, in case.
okay. Okay.
so all we need to do is find a pharmacy.
don't worry.
Hey, looks like we're going on a ride, sweet pea.
look, we nail bagwell, he might still have some of geary's things on him, like his backpack, which has his personal stuff in it. I know his wife would love to have it.
if we find bagwell, you can give it to her personally.
Thanks.
it's the least I can do considering ho you're helping me out.
though some of the guys on the force are concerned about...
what are they concerned about?
nothing.
but you know what?
why don't you tell me what you know, we'll track down bagwell, we'll get geary's effects back to his family, I'll make sure that everybody involved knows that your help was invaluable.
I'll even recommend that you get most of, if not all of, that reward money.
what is it exactly that the guys on the force were concerned about?
well, some of them thought that you weren't being totally upfront about your head injury.
I mean, to be fair, it does seem a little off that you didn't see the guy who hit you smack-dab on the forehead.
you got me.
geary and me had a little dustup over how to go about finding bagwell.
it got physical, and he hit me.
the two of us, we fought like brothers. I didn't want to rat him out to the cops.
after the fight, we split up.
and then...
well, you know what happened to him.
I just wish to hell we'd never fought, you know?
maybe then he'd still be...
Brad, you can't blame yourself.
why don't we refocus our energy on finng the man who killed your friend?
that's what roy would've wanted.
all right, baby.
insurance card?
uh, no, I don't have insurance.
you're paying for dexamethasone without insurance?
you got medicaid, medicare or something?
Nope. Um, I'll just pay cash.
it's $125.
excuse me?
excuse me?
um, oh, sorry.
sorry I don't have anything smaller.
I have to go to the back to get change for $100.
so... I'll be right back.
right there! Hospital! - I see it.
I see it. Just get us there.
no, you'll be caught.
then we'll be caught.
I'm not gonna let you die.
then listen to me.
you find sara tancredi.
she can end this.
it's up to you now.
Yeah, I want an alarm out on a dark blue sedan.
license: Ae9268.
40 miles southeast of los cruces.
do it now.
Oh, come on!
what?
what hospital?
carlsbad. NEW MEXICO ST. DE LORENZO HOSPITAL
he came in with a bad gsw.
docs called us in. He's in here.
we ran his name.
came back with two federal drug smuggling warrants out on him.
heard you wanted to talk to me.
I got some information the feds want...
about michael scofield.
like where he's catching a ride.
and where would that be?
it's not just the where but the when.
that when is coming up soon.
but I want to cut a deal first.
give us a minute.
anything you want to say?
one daY. That's all we had.
back then, when things were at their worst...
there were days I thought I'd never see the sun again.
but he saved my life.
I just wish he could have let us be a part of his.
Yeah.
I'll tell him.
here's the deal.
all charges dropped and the government picks up medical costs until you're fit to be deported, all contingent upon your information being accurate.
Where's scofield?
no deportation. I want citizenship.
citizenship?
a little incentive, and I want it in writing.
I'm so tired of playing games.
well, start typing.
no external pacemaker.
Oh, this is a good one-- no morphine drip.
what are you doing?
FBI. Out. Out!
what the hell are you doing?
giving you a little incentive.
come on! Come on, you son of A...
and they found nothing?
okay, thanks.
well, your instincts are great, brad, but the precinct actually sent a unit over to hollander's house today.
an anonymous caller said they saw an intruder but no one was there.
damn it.
if you knew about bagwell and hollander, why didn't you just head over there yourself?
we couldn't find the house.
Really? It's listed.
excuse me.
thank you.
everything okay?
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.
Brad, have you ever been to the fauntleroy hotel? It's about 15 minutes from here.
never heard of it.
well, that's strange, 'cause they found this receipt in geary's hotel room.
it's from your credit card.
thank YOU FOR SHOPPING WITH US
I don't know how that got there.
I think you're being evasive.
you should tell me the truth, mr. Bellick.
what happened to "brad"?
about seven years ago, I got my first homicide case a woman, pretty. She was brutally attacked.
animal boyfriend left her for dead, but she was still breathing... barely.
but she punched into her cell phone the killer's number, so she solved the crime for us.
when we found the receipt, brad, it was in geary's hand, his finger pointing to your name.
with his last ounce of strength, he told us you killed him.
okay, listen.
geary and I found bagwell at hollander's house.
we roughed him up till he told us where he'd hid the five million bucks we knew he dug up in utah.
when we found the money, geary double-crossed me.
he hit me in the head and took the cash.
I had nothing to do with geary's death.
you hear what I'm saying?
I'm the victim here, not that son of a bitch!
come on, come on, come on.
where are you at, baby?
Hey, uh, could you hurry it up?
it's just it's getting really late-- I got to get home.
and, um, that's $20,$40, $50, and $20 is $70.
seventy-five.
you got to be kidding me.
ma'am.
afternoon, officer.
do you have any id with you?
no. I walked over here, so i didn't carry anything with me.
did you? Where'd you walk from?
is there a problem, officer?
there's only a problem if you make one, ms. Franklin.
you want to tell us where your husband is?
I don't know.
place your hands behind your back, please, ma'am.
baby, I'm so sorry.
Oh, my god.
Where's mommy?
mommy, uh, mommy is going to meet us later. Okay?
Yes. - Where's the photo?
bill, there was a tactical error.
I don't want terminology from the cover your ass handbook, paul.
what happened?
there were unforeseen circumstances, things that could not be predicted.
Where's sara?
she's gone, isn't she?
Yes, she got away, but there's no way that she could...
I'm not going to let you die.
I love you.
you know that, don't you?
too many.
too many people died because I wanted you to be free.
you couldn't have known, michael.
you couldn't have know it... would have ended up like this.
but it did.
they wanted him.
they wanted him in the ground, and they got their wish.
this thing is not going to end here, michael.
I know. - It's going to keep spreading.
their hands are going to get more and more bloody.
well, the question is, is the blood on their hands... or ours?
I'm sorry, guys.
we got to go.
get back on with border patrol.
call the navy reserve air station in dallas.
they've got planes on alert.
we need an intercept of a white, single engine a-36 beech heading toward the border.
call mexico, get clearance for an international pursuit.
tell them if they got to take the plane down, just do it.
come on, guys!
guys, come on.
come on, guys.
what?
we're staying.
ay, vamonos! - Esperate, esperate, esperate.
Michael, this is what we've been waiting for.
maybe we'll see you down there somewhere.
I can't talk you out of this one, can i?
well, I hope so.
be good.
thank you, michael.
thank you for everything.
take care, all right? - I will.
fly safe, papi.
give 'em hell.
panama would've been good.
are you ready for this?
been waiting years. - Good to hear it.
cause today is the day we stop running.
what now? - We go back to the car.
I drive to a border town, find a cell phone signal.
call sara.
where the hell are those jets?
you hear that?
Yeah.
pull over.
Oh, god, they're going after sucre.
they're gonna take him down.
how'd they find out? - I don't know.
I want to know what the hell's going on.
if you could've arrested me, you would've already done it.
I'm out of here.
not really an option for you, mr. Bellick.
what do you got, a receipt? He left it in his pocket. A fight? Big deal.
I got ten pals in chicago tell you geary and i threw down once a month.
you're right.
any of those things on their own, probably not enough.
but when you add this...
what the hell's that?
you left a message for mr. Geary.
you thieving son of a bitch, you better get down on your knees and pray to god that I don't find you.
because if I do, mark my words:
I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.
you want to hear it again?
now at this juncture, brad, things will go a whole lot easier for you if you admit to the crime.
now you listen to me, you manipulative little bitch.
I did not kill roy geary!
you understand what I'm telling you!
Bagwell set me up!
get your hds off of me!
Bradley bellick, you are under arrest for the first-degree murder of roy william geary.
you have a right to remain silent.
anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
you have a right to talk with an attorney and to have him present with you when being questioned.
if you cannot hire an attorney...
president reynolds' office.
this is agent paul kellerman.
I need to speak with the president right now, please.
I'm sorry, this administration isn't familiar with an agent kellerman.
june, it's me.
I need to speak with caroline now.
june, if you don't put me through,
I'll make certain that the president knows that you were the one who did not allow me to provide her with some very important information.
now.
I'm sorry, this administration isn't familiar with an agent...
please leave a message after the tone.
bill, don't do thiS.
I've dedicated my life to this country, to caroline.
everything I have, I give.
every photo, every file. Get rid of it all.
make him a ghost.
I've been a perfect soldier.
I've never asked anything of you, ever.
but I'm asking now.
bill, don't do thiS.
I don't see him.
trust me, we haven't lost him yet.
no Service..
Connecting.. No Service..
stop the car. - What?
we got to stop the car.
that's a radio tower over there.
it must be picking up some kind of analog signal.
we got to get closer.
turn around.
what about your friend back there?
if we're gonna go down, might as well go down swinging.
come on, come on, come on...
connecting 505-555-0162
we are in business.
it's going through.
come on, sara, pick up.
Hello?
Hello? Michael?
let me get this straight.
the brothers come back to a city that's 15 miles from the prison they escaped from-- why would they do that?
maybe it's because the president is in chicago to make a speech, and they're up to something, legally speaking, this tape is useless.

well, I ain't hanging around; I need a favor.
you owe me.
I-I do. Y-you know I do.
look, it's just.
look, it's just your situation right now.
I mean, I just had a kid, a baby boy, and I promised marie.
I didn't come here to cause trouble.
I'm short on friends; I need to hook me up.
you're the only one who can do it without the green up front.
I'm serious about this, man.

we got him down pretty quick, but you never know.
somebody may have gotten a shot.
check around.
confiscate cameras if you need to.
put out a statement before rumors get started.
and get everyone out of here.
now.
we're still waiting for the response from counter.
you and I both know that this situation requires us to abandon protocol.
I don't know what you need to tell them, but I need your men to leave.
now.
Yes, sir.
Where's your brother?
I need to see the president.
Really?
and you think that's a possibility?
she'll want to hear what I have to say.
Oh, I highly doubt that.
the only person you get to talk to.
is me.
and the only way you're going to live through the next hour is if you tell me where to find your brother.
okay.
he's in a safe place. - Be more specific.
specifically.
a place you will never find him.
I had the honor.
to attend this country's most prestigious military academy.
whose mission it is "to educate, encourage,
building a strong man "committed to the values of honor, freedom and country.
but, first and foremost, they taught you this.
rio JUAREZ MEXICO how do you say "cherries" again?
looks like you have to get more cerezas.
baby, I just got you 100 pistachios, with the right amount of salt, too.
well, it's the combination.
I need both.
why am I a sucker for you, huh?
what?
what's she saying? - That looks like t-bag.
he said he was trying to steal luggage from the airport, but.
he's got $5 million. Why would he.
unless he doesn't have it.
unless he lost it there.
stop it, fernando. - What?
do you really believe that that money is at the airport?
Hey, forget it.
look at at we have together.
do you really want to risk that?
we have everything that we need.
except your cerezas. - Right.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
you got to know it's not real hard for me to recognize a junkie.
I'M...I'M.
I'm saying you don't look so good.
I'm fine.
you mind me asking what you're taking?
here. You want one?
no, that's okay.
save it for later.
Benzodiazepine's a hard-core tranquilizer, man.
you take these every day?
20 milligrams.
you must feel like you're walking underwater.
I do.
it's very quiet down here.
that's why you started, right?
peace and quiet.
that's not why you do it anymore, though, is it?
now it's the headaches, right?
and you probably don't sleep.
and you know you're going to destroy yourself, right?
I haven't ruled that out as a possibility.
I hope we hear from your boyfriend.
there's one difference between me and agent mahone.
he doesn't know the value of a bird in the hand
he just keeps beating and beating around that bush.
but if you don't give up burrows, I don't care.
one down, one to go.
I need to talk to mr. Scofield.
alone.
madam president.
could I.
have a word?
it wouldn't be prudent for me to leave you alone with mr. Scofield.
my men are right outside this door.
I have a right to privacy.
your rights aren't my first concern.
do I need to remind you who you are talking to?
step outside, and close the door behind you.
the things you do for your brother.
it's impressive.
I could say the same for you.
but I won'T.
bear in mind, your opinion means little to me.
this tape.
you have it with you?
no.
but I can arrange for you to hear it.
you don't make arrangements for me, mr. Scofield.
I have people for that.
I'm not exactly sure what is on this tape, but I doubt it's of any interest to me.
it's a recorded conversation between you and your brother.
well, out of millions of conversations that I had with my brother during his lifetime.
I'll narrow it down for you.
it was recorded sometime after his death.
and this particular conversation.
you might want to keep in the family.
and where is it?
20 different copies in 20 different locations.
I can call my brother right now.
he can play it for you.
not on the phone.
have him bring it here.
these are the terms.
you can hear it over the phone, or you can hear it on the news.
it's up to you.
I know it's why I started.
started what?
using. Same reason as you.
why, because you had to stay up all night during residency?
because the bass player dumped you in front of the whole sorority?
Yeah, you and I got a lot in common.
I've seen people die, too.
I'm assuming you didn't make them die.
you need help.
not what I'm looking for.
for your sake, I hope your boyfriend calls back real soon.
where the hell is everybody?
lookie here, good ol' sucre.
what did you do to them?
where are they? Maricruz!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, keep your cap on.
they're out picking apples for the snuffleupagus.
if you ever. - calm down!
they're going to walk back in here any minute.
which means trouble.
now, unless you want to see me try out the new t-20z on your bella muchacha, mari-poon.
I think you'd better come with me.
I understand you have something for me.
you still there?
Oh, I'm here.
it's good to finally talk to you.
wish I had the chance one of those 242 nights I spent on death row.
please just play the tape.
it's awful, I know.
but the choice was clear.
you needed to be far away from all of this.
I am.
I'm the isle of terrence, far off to sea.
look, I'm still here for you.
now, listen to me, don't dwell on the negative.
some people deserve to dwell, caroline.
you know I'm only a phone call away.
and 3, 000 miles.
do you.
do you know how cold it is here?
we talked about this, terrence.
you knew that you would be lonely, but it's only temporary.
his appeals process has started already.
this is gonna fly by quicker than your 20s.
and soon the world will forget all about him and they'll forget about you, too.
I promise.
but.
it's killing me not being able to see you, sweet caroline.
I want to see you, too.
but that can't happen right now.
this house is so big.
I just think of you.
lying in bed.
I know. Me, too.
your warmth. your touch.
was it quick when he killed himself?
it was a lot quicker than how my father died.
they shot him in the back.
he died in my arms.
I just want to know what happened.
your brother apologized.
he said he was sorry, and then he blew his brains out all over the wall.
it was quick.
and it was his decision.
and now it's time for you to make yours.
Nah, nah, nah, man.
I can't do it.
I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
there's nothing to be afraid of.
you don't get it, do you?
you can't stop this guy.
not without your cooperation, I can't, but if you talk to me, if you tell me what's going on, I can take care of you, okay?
you've got to trust me, mr. Franklin.
I can help you.
c-note, right?
yeah Whatever, man.
all I need you to do is tell me exactly what agent mahone told you.
if you give me mahone, I'll give you your life back.
God's been smiling down on me, I can tell you that.
first, I caught up to haywire up in algoma.
he did a swan dive off a grain elevator before they could put him away, but I still get the reward.
wait, wait, wait. He's dead?
Yep, like a gnat on a peterbilt.
hope you don't take the same route, sucre.
Oh, hell no, I got plenty reasons to live.
I hope a few of them are in fox river.
or maybe, if you play nice, I'll throw your maricruz a couple bills after I turn you in.
how much are you getting for this?
a hundred grand.
I bet you never thought your ass'd be worth all that.
wait, wait, wait.
what if I know where you can get five million dollars?
you heard me.
where is it?
I could take you there, if you didn't have to take me back to the states and turn me back in.
where is it?
T-Bag's in town.
I made my commitment a long time ago.
I agreed to put my country ahead of myself, like a mother does for a child.
and I thought that what I was doing was noble and that I would be rewarded.
you were wrong.
don't you see that I'm a pawn in this, too?
the power that has taken over this country is like a cancer, d it will stop at nothing.
it is out of my control.
so is this.
tell me what you want from me.
uncuff me.
I don't have the keys. - You'll get them.
second, I want you to arrange for me to walk away, alone.
no surveillance.
okay.
and finally, want a presidential pardon for me and my brother, fully exonerating us of all our crimes.
and I want it today.
I can't just hand out pardons to anyone I choose.
there is a process, rules.
this is no exception.
a document will be delivered for your approval just like any pardon.
you'll sign it and then file it with the attorney general who'll submit to the presidential record.
fine. I will sign whatever you need me to sign.
that's very kind, but we both know that's not enough.
what do you want from me?
I will unlock you myself, walk you out of here.
what, you want me to drive you to the airport?
I guess I'm not as trusting as I used to be, especially with paperwork.
it's so easy to lose.
no, I want you to go out there in front of everyone and announce our full pardon on live tv.
you're insane.
that is not the way things are done.
this is not a vacuum-- people will ask questions.
pardon! On stage. Now.
and-and how do I know that you won't release the tape an hour later?
you don'T.
you'll just have to take my word for it.
well, I need more than that.
well, you're not going to get it.
it's time.
make your choice.
adams, I need you to uncuff the detainee and bring him here to be released.
what are you doing?
I am going to make an announcement pardoning mr. Scofield and his brother, and he will walk away unharmed.
are you out of your mind?
he has brought some indisputable evidence to light.
we could end this all right now.
and you're gonna let them walk?
am the commander in chief, and you are a corporate lackey.
I am making the calls now; you have no authority.
my men will see to it that mr. Scofield walks away without the interference of you and your pit bulls.
you alone? - Yeah.
how'd you do?
three tickets, one cabin, one way.
nice.
I owe you.
no, we're even.
these are few you. - Nice.
and this.
what's this?
Eddie, when he broke out, bet me a hundred bucks you'd be caught in a week.
I said,"no way. Not the linc I know.
figured I'd split it with you.
so this is it, huh?
good luck.
you take care. - You, too.
all right.
you be safe.
your neck of the woods.
Yeah, how's third and racine?
I'll be there.
I don't want to do this, I really don'T.
what are you, what are you talking about?
but you can't say that I didn't give you a choice, but you, you know, you never take the easy way, you.
and I noticed that about you, you.
I didn't expect it to be any different, but I have a job to do, a job that I'm being made to do.
pick it up, sara.
Sara, pick it up.
pick up the phone! - Wait, wait!
don't move.
just, uh.
don't, don't move.
okay, I need the phone. Give me the phone.
stay right where you are, please.
you don't really want to do this.
you don't know the first thing about what I want.
get my message?
I got her.
she's on her way out.
follow her; she'll take you right to scofield.
sir.
we need to talk.
in just a few minutes, the president is going to announce a pardon for burrows and scofield.
as you're well aware, this is quite a departure.
she's always been willing to play ball, but I think we need to take some sort of action.
sir.
I hate to disturb you, but I'm not sure you realize the gravity of what she's about to do.
Sara, it worked.
the pardon?
she's announcing it any minute.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Michael, that's amazing.
just get here, okay?
I'm on, uh.
highland. It's a warehouse.
it runs right down to the water.
uh, yeah, yeah, I'm on my way.
we did it.
what happened to your face, man?
if you want to take the ride.
you got to buy the ticket.
Yeah, right. Well, uh, derek hooked us up with a cabin on one of those freighters.
south america via the great lakeS.
we're not going to need that, but, uh, this is appreciated.
one more time, bro.
we did it?
it's done.
we're done.
I wish I could have seen the look on her face.
no, you don'T.
Oh, ye, I do.
unbelievable.
she's going to do it.
unbelievable.
the president is now taking the stage here at the grand carlisle hotel.
the two-hour delay in her appearance due to an investigation characterized by press secretary ryan berg as "an overzealous fan.
you are not going to do this.
I'm afraid I am.
there are some developments you need to be aware of.
I have made my decision.
and I would appreciate you not second-guessing me.
I don't think you understand.
we know your secrets, too.
and we can reveal them just as easily.
you need to ask yourself who you fear more, michael scofield or us?
you got 30 seconds.
I won't keep you.
the world is waiting.
ten seconds.
ladies and gentlemen, the president of the united states.
thank you for waiting so patiently all afternoon.
if it were not for the support of this great state, my home state of illinois.
I would not be here today.
which is why I have chosen today to make this very important announcement.
a situation has recently come to light, and I feel that I must take action.
it is my job as president of this great country to make rational decisions when I am given facts.
decisions that are best not for me, but for the people.
and so, after much consideration,
I regret to inform you that I have been diagnosed with a highly malignant form of cancer.
and because of that reason,
I am no longer fit to serve as your commander in chief.
in the best interest of this country, effective immediately,
I am stepping down as president of the united states.
if she ain't the president, the tape's useless.
she can't pardon anyone.
we got nothing.
there's only one thing we can do.
we got to disappear.
forever.
let me get this straight.
the brothers come back to a city that's 15 miles from the prison they escaped from-- why would they do that?
maybe it's because the president is in chicago to make a speech, and they're up to something, legally speaking, this tape is useless.
so we blackmail her.
in exchange for what?
a presidential pardon.
now, are we gonna keep crying about money you've already got coming to you?
or do you want to make some more?
I'm listening. - Ever been to mexico?
when's the meal coming around? I'm starved.
freshen me up when you get a chance, darlin'.

that's not why you do it anymore, though, is it?
now it's the headaches, right?
and you probably don't sleep.
and you know you're going to destroy yourself, right?
I haven't ruled that out as a possibility.
I hope we hear from your boyfriend.
there's one difference between me and agent mahone.
he doesn't know the value of a bird in the hand
he just keeps beating and beating around that bush.
but if you don't give up burrows, I don't care.
one down, one to go.
I need to talk to mr. Scofield.
alone.
madam president.
could I.
have a word?
it wouldn't be prudent for me to leave you alone with mr. Scofield.
my men are right outside this door.
I have a right to privacy.
your rights aren't my first concern.
do I need to remind you who you are talking to?
step outside, and close the door behind you.
the things you do for your brother.
it's impressive.
I could say the same for you.
but I won'T.
bear in mind, your opinion means little to me.
this tape.
you have it with you?
no.
but I can arrange for you to hear it.
you don't make arrangements for me, mr. Scofield.
I have people for that.
I'm not exactly sure what is on this tape, but I doubt it's of any interest to me.
it's a recorded conversation between you and your brother.
well, out of millions of conversations that I had with my brother during his lifetime.
I'll narrow it down for you.
it was recorded sometime after his death.
and this particular conversation.
you might want to keep in the family.
and where is it?
20 different copies in 20 different locations.
I can call my brother right now.
he can play it for you.
not on the phone.
have him bring it here.
these are the terms.
you can hear it over the phone, or you can hear it on the news.
it's up to you.
I know it's why I started.
started what?
using. Same reason as you.
why, because you had to stay up all night during residency?
because the bass player dumped you in front of the whole sorority?
Yeah, you and I got a lot in common.
I've seen people die, too.
I'm assuming you didn't make them die.
you need help.
not what I'm looking for.
for your sake, I hope your boyfriend calls back real soon.
ia?
where the hell is everybody?
mami.
lookie here, good ol' sucre.
what did you do to them?
where are they? Maricruz!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, keep your cap on.
they're out picking apples for the snuffleupagus.
if you ever. - calm down!
they're going to walk back in here any minute.
which means trouble.
now, unless you want to see me try out the new t-20z on your bella muchacha, mari-poon.
I think you'd better come with me.
I understand you have something for me.
you still there?
Oh, I'm here.
it's good to finally talk to you.
wish I had the chance one of those 242 nights I spent on death row.
please just play the tape.
it's awful, I know.
but the choice was clear.
you needed to be far away from all of this.
I am.
I'm the isle of terrence, far off to sea.
look, I'm still here for you.
now, listen to me, don't dwell on the negative.
some people deserve to dwell, caroline.
you know I'm only a phone call away.
and 3, 000 miles.
do you.
do you know how cold it is here?
we talked about this, terrence.
you knew that you would be lonely, but it's only temporary.
his appeals process has started already.
this is gonna fly by quicker than your 20s.
and soon the world will forget all about him and they'll forget about you, too.
I promise.
but.
it's killing me not being able to see you, sweet caroline.
I want to see you, too.
but that can't happen right now.
this house is so big.
I just think of you.
lying in bed.
I know. Me, too.
your warmth. your touch.
was it quick when he killed himself?
it was a lot quicker than how my father died.
they shot him in the back.
he died in my arms.
I just want to know what happened.
your brother apologized.
he said he was sorry, and then he blew his brains out all over the wall.
it was quick.
and it was his decision.
and now it's time for you to make yours.
Nah, nah, nah, man.
I can't do it.
I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
there's nothing to be afraid of.
you don't get it, do you?
you can't stop this guy.
not without your cooperation, I can't, but if you talk to me, if you tell me what's going on, I can take care of you, okay?
you've got to trust me, mr. Franklin.
I can help you.
c-note, right?
yeah Whatever, man.
all I need you to do is tell me exactly what agent mahone told you.
if you give me mahone, I'll give you your life back.
God's been smiling down on me, I can tell you that.
first, I caught up to haywire up in algoma.
he did a swan dive off a grain elevator before they could put him away, but I still get the reward.
wait, wait, wait. He's dead?
Yep, like a gnat on a peterbilt.
hope you don't take the same route, sucre.
Oh, hell no, I got plenty reasons to live.
I hope a few of them are in fox river.
or maybe, if you play nice, I'll throw your maricruz a couple bills after I turn you in.
how much are you getting for this?
a hundred grand.
I bet you never thought your ass'd be worth all that.
wait, wait, wait.
what if I know where you can get five million dollars?
you heard me.
where is it?
I could take you there, if you didn't have to take me back to the states and turn me back in.
where is it?
T-Bag's in town.
I made my commitment a long time ago.
I agreed to put my country ahead of myself, like a mother does for a child.
and I thought that what I was doing was noble and that I would be rewarded.
you were wrong.
don't you see that I'm a pawn in this, too?
the power that has taken over this country is like a cancer, d it will stop at nothing.
it is out of my control.
so is this.
tell me what you want from me.
uncuff me.
I don't have the keys. - You'll get them.
second, I want you to arrange for me to walk away, alone.
no surveillance.
okay.
and finally, want a presidential pardon for me and my brother, fully exonerating us of all our crimes.
and I want it today.
I can't just hand out pardons to anyone I choose.
there is a process, rules.
this is no exception.
a document will be delivered for your approval just like any pardon.
you'll sign it and then file it with the attorney general who'll submit to the presidential record.
fine. I will sign whatever you need me to sign.
that's very kind, but we both know that's not enough.
what do you want from me?
I will unlock you myself, walk you out of here.
what, you want me to drive you to the airport?
I guess I'm not as trusting as I used to be, especially with paperwork.
it's so easy to lose.
no, I want you to go out there in front of everyone and announce our full pardon on live tv.
you're insane.
that is not the way things are done.
this is not a vacuum-- people will ask questions.
and-and how do I know that you won't release the tape an hour later?
you don'T.
you'll just have to take my word for it.
well, I need more than that.
well, you're not going to get it.
it's time.
make your choice.
adams, I need you to uncuff the detainee and bring him here to be released.
what are you doing?
I am going to make an announcement pardoning mr. Scofield and his brother, and he will walk away unharmed.
are you out of your mind?
he has brought some indisputable evidence to light.
we could end this all right now.
and you're gonna let them walk?
am the commander in chief, and you are a corporate lackey.
I am making the calls now; you have no authority.
my men will see to it that mr. Scofield walks away without the interference of you and your pit bulls.
you alone? - Yeah.
how'd you do?
three tickets, one cabin, one way.
nice.
I owe you.
no, we're even.
these are few you. - Nice.
and this.
what's this?
Eddie, when he broke out, bet me a hundred bucks you'd be caught in a week.
I said,"no way. Not the linc I know.
figured I'd split it with you.
so this is it, huh?
good luck.
you take care. - You, too.
all right.
you be safe.
your neck of the woods.
Yeah, how's third and racine?
I'll be there.
I don't want to do this, I really don'T.
what are you, what are you talking about?
but you can't say that I didn't give you a choice, but you, you know, you never take the easy way, you.
and I noticed that about you, you.
I didn't expect it to be any different, but I have a job to do, a job that I'm being made to do.
pick it up, sara.
Sara, pick it up.
pick up the phone! - Wait, wait!
don't move.
just, uh.
don't, don't move.
okay, I need the phone. Give me the phone.
stay right where you are, please.
you don't really want to do this.
you don't know the first thing about what I want.
get my message?
I got her.
she's on her way out.
follow her; she'll take you right to scofield.
sir.
we need to talk.
in just a few minutes, the president is going to announce a pardon for burrows and scofield.
as you're well aware, this is quite a departure.
she's always been willing to play ball, but I think we need to take some sort of action.
sir.
I hate to disturb you, but I'm not sure you realize the gravity of what she's about to do.
Sara, it worked.
the pardon?
she's announcing it any minute.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Michael, that's amazing.
just get here, okay?
I'm on, uh.
highland. It's a warehouse.
it runs right down to the water.
uh, yeah, yeah, I'm on my way.
we did it.
what happened to your face, man?
if you want to take the ride.
you got to buy the ticket.
Yeah, right. Well, uh, derek hooked us up with a cabin on one of those freighters.
south america via the great lakeS.
we're not going to need that, but, uh, this is appreciated.
one more time, bro.
we did it?
it's done.
we're done.
I wish I could have seen the look on her face.
no, you don'T.
Oh, ye, I do.
unbelievable.
she's going to do it.
unbelievable.
the president is now taking the stage here at the grand carlisle hotel.
the two-hour delay in her appearance due to an investigation characterized by press secretary ryan berg as "an overzealous fan.
you are not going to do this.
I'm afraid I am.
there are some developments you need to be aware of.
I have made my decision.
and I would appreciate you not second-guessing me.
I don't think you understand.
we know your secrets, too.
and we can reveal them just as easily.
you need to ask yourself who you fear more, michael scofield or us?
you got 30 seconds.
I won't keep you.
the world is waiting.
ten seconds.
ladies and gentlemen, the president of the united states.
thank you for waiting so patiently all afternoon.
if it were not for the support of this great state, my home state of illinois.
I would not be here today.
which is why I have chosen today to make this very important announcement.
a situation has recently come to light, and I feel that I must take action.
it is my job as president of this great country to make rational decisions when I am given facts.
decisions that are best not for me, but for the people.
and so, after much consideration,
I regret to inform you that I have been diagnosed with a highly malignant form of cancer.
and because of that reason,
I am no longer fit to serve as your commander in chief.
in the best interest of this country, effective immediately,
I am stepping down as president of the united states.
if she ain't the president, the tape's useless.
she can't pardon anyone.
we got nothing.
there's only one thing we can do.
we got to disappear.
forever.
I'm so sorry.
they got me and Sara.
LJ and Sara will be traded for Whistler.
are we clear?
I want a picture of my son and Sara to prove they're alive.
I will have a court date one of these days, and you will be there.
you're on your own.
I'm James Whistler's girlfriend
why does he want this?
he's just a fisherman.
tell your fisherman friend Scofield's brother has this.
just take the bounty off Whistler.
Whistler don't mean nothing to me, man.
there are ways I can be of assistance.
Whistler's clear?
clear as the blue sky, brother.
so, how are we getting out of here?
I have no idea.
what the hell are you doing?
I just... I need some money, and I didn't... I didn't know where else to go.
I've got about $50.
no, no. I'm talking about the millions, papi.
the backpack?
there's all sorts of cash in that thing.
need a place to crash, I got your back, but the backpack's gone.
any money I dig out is for my brother.
remember him?
tall guy, kind of thin.
busted your ass out of jail.
I feel bad about Mike.
I do, Linc.
but not all of us got exonerated, you know.
pretty clear on that.
I can't ever go home again.
you got problems, Sucre?
you ain't the only one, Linc.
that's right.
we're all guilty of something, man.
all of us.
not them.
I want to help.
but it seems like it's only getting deeper and deeper.
look, I just, I just want money to get back on my feet and that's it, Linc.
never mind.
doesn't take too long for a man to become animal, no?
the smart ones go for his bunk first.
what do the dumb ones do?
Hey, I was here first.
Mampi bitch, you been here two days.
I meant I was the first one to the shoe, you sack-in-the-box- now hand it over.
you're asking for a chicken foot, friend.
you want this shoe?
you're gonna have to come and get it.
leave him. Leave him.
I just wanted to express my thanks for, uh... for Whistler.
I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about.
my mistake.
anyway, I thought maybe we could make some kind of arrangement.
maybe I could help out around Sona.
come here, boy.
leave.
you help me?
I'm the bucky massa here, boy.
me. Not you.
so if anyone want anything at Sona, it's me them will come to.
no, no, no, no, no. We do not.
the next time you roll in here like that, boy, the only thing you ask me for is mercy.
Scofield, visitor.
go on, boy.
now, run along, your momma calling ya.
that bad, huh?
it's not good.
you?
I followed that message you got from Whistler.
it's all about some book.
a bird guide - Any clues as about who he might be?
no. We weren't the only ones following his directions.
his girl was there, says he's some kind of fisherman.
Yeah, sure he is.
listen, man, I, uh, I want you to check something out.
Oh, my god!
the way she's holding the paper it's like she's, uh, it's like she's pointing at something.
it's too small I can't read it.
this is today's paper.
she's pointing at Santa Rita.
it's a small town 20 miles from here.
she's trying to tell us where she is.
I have to talk to her, Linc.
even if they let you talk to her, man, they'll be listening to every word you say.
you can't do that.
we're gonna need more than the name of that town.
I'm coming up empty-handed here, Linc.
it's already been three days and... I got nothing to show for it.
so, if I can't break Whistler out of here...
you're gonna have to break them out of there.
so, what's the deal, mate?
when's moving day?
I'll tell you the plan when you tell me who you are.
I'm a fisherman. - Really?
so am I.
you're worried about trusting me?
my life is in your hands.
how am I supposed to know that I can trust you?
you don't.
Hey. - Stuart Scott.
number one, right?
you watch the sports center?
not recently.
look, I need to get my hands on a phone.
I need to get my hands on some pechos.
but that ain't gonna happen either, is it?
who you got to call so important anyway?
absolutely not.
it ain't a request; it's a dictation of terms.
my brother ain't thinking about escape till he talks to Sa.
Aw, that's sweet.
I can assure you of two things, Lincoln.
one, that Sara's fine and two, you have a better chance of banging me on that bar than you do of talking to her.
I appreciate the offer, but I'll pass.
yeah? - Yeah.
Oh, what if that's a dictation of terms.
it's not a matter of negotiation.
government rip out all the phones when they find out bad men in Sona still setting up deals.
making bang-bangs just like before.
they just did it over the phone.
well, if they cut the lines, maybe we can fix 'em.
there's nothing to fix, bro.
there used to be a whole row of them all along the wall, but they're gone now.
if you have no more questions I'm just gonna get going.
michael got the bounty off Whistler's head in two days.
that's more than your people could do in two weeks.
show some goodwill.
he'll get his goodwill when Whistler's out.
one thing you should know about my brother, he's very stubborn.
you want him to fetch, you throw him a bone.
how does Michael think he's gonna get his hands on a phone inside Sona?
what about cell phones?
with all the traffic moving in and out of here.
cell phone big no-no.
let me guess.
what is it?
the weekly from your operations on the outside.
grave digger dropped it off.
that couldn't be.
this envelope way too thin.
stuff just moving a little slow on the outside these days.
Oh, stuff moving slow.
somebody making it move slower.
set up something at the barber downstairs for me now.
Yes, sir.
no problem at all.
you tell that bitch she nick me with the razor again, I'm gonna use it upon her.
you're still alive.
and you're still lovely.
Oh, please, I haven't showered three days.
whatever you smell like, it's a significant upgrade.
when I didn't hear from you, I...
I'm sorry.
I warned you it might be a bit... - I know, I know.
it's just... every time they dragged out a body...
look at me.
I promise you when I leave this place, it won't be like that.
okay.
now, were you able to find my book?
Yeah.
but there was this guy.
he followed me.
what guy?
I don't know.
did he hurt you?
no, but he took it.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know what to do.
what did he look like?
um... shaved head, kind of big.
he said to tell you that Scofield's brother has it now.
who's Scofield? - Okay.
who's Scofield?
hmm? No one.
he's just, um... he's someone I'm working with.
he's gonna help me get out of here.
he's a lawyer?
basically.
that's why you want him to have the book.
look, Sofia, the less you know about this, the safer you'll be.
the less I know, the less help I'll be.
exactly.
I just need you to lay low for a while. Okay, sweetheart?
what the hell is going on, James?
what is so important about this book?
nothing.
it just has notes in it, you know, phone numbers.
it's people who know people who are going to help me get out of here.
you're lying.
why would I lie to you?
you're the only person in the world that I can trust.
come here.
come here.
now, I just need you to trust me.
and do what?
nothing.
sign out please
you looking for something, blanquito?
Yeah, yeah, I am, I am.
what you looking for then?
just a little, uh... little something to pass the time.
you got paper?
go down to the lost and found with the rest of them.
they'll hook you up proper.
all right.
I find you sniffing around where you don't belong, l find yourself in that ring again... against me.
I don't like your odds.
I want you to check something out, all right?
look at her left hand - like she's pointing at something.
well, you'd better tell my cousin he'd better make himself available.
better him short money than me short patience.
I need a charge.
teodoro, go on, get me laundry, no?
sure thing, boss - oh, I almost forgot.
uh, I talked to the barber.
she's gonna squeeze you in today around 2: 00.
I think it's time you made good on all the bad you've done, Teodore.
you and me, we're going to make a deal.
Lechero has a cell phone.
I need it.
no problem.
shall I turn water into wine while I'm at it?
maybe give the guy's mother a good rodgering?
she'd be a little old for your tastes, no?
careful, pretty.
don't bite the hand you trying to get fed out of.
I'm not looking for food, I'm looking for a favor.
why the hell should I do you a favor, huh?
cause unlike your new compadres, I know who you are, what you've done and who you've done it to.
let me get this straight.
you're saying you gonna tell on me?
what I'm saying is: This here is a religious country, and I'm willing to bet the good folks down in Panama don't take too kindly to rapists and pedophiles.
you want to bet against me?
listen, mate.
here's what I know so far.
I know you've got a brother helping on the outside,
I know he ran into my girlfriend, and I know he took a book from her that belongs to me.
I'd like it back.
what's so special about this book?
well, unless it has directions out of this prison,
I don't think it should really matter to you.
you don't know what matters to me.
you can get that book back when we get out of Sona.
Oh, yeah?
and when the hell is that exactly?
because so far I haven't seen bollocks in the way of breaking out of here.
okay.
let me tell you what I know so far.
some very bad people who have done some very bad things want you alive and out of this prison, which is why every bone in my body is telling me to do the opposite.
then why are you doing it?
you're upset because someone took a book from you.
this is what they took from me.
so let's be clear.
this is what matters to me, not you and not your book.
hello.
cousin, how is it?
Hey, Augusto.
you tell me, man.
Oh, business is cyclical, don dada.
ebbs and flows, ebbs and flows, you know.
seems like there's more ebbing than flowing these days, huh?
you think?
I'm gonna tell you what I think, man.
I think a black heart is trying to steal my business.
is taking advantage of my situation.
if there are mistakes have been made, all I need is some honesty, man.
well, maybe the problem isn't on the outside.
maybe the problem is... Augusto.
battery dead.
the bloodfire!
how me phone come unplugged?
my battery dead.
none of you know nothing, huh?
Mr. Mahone?
I am the public defender appointed to your case.
that's, uh... uh, that's great, that's great.
I-I've been putting together some notes that I...
looks like I have some great news.
we got you a trial date.
that's really... th-thank god. Thank god - when?
june 13.
Oh, no, no, wait, wait, wait, th-the... 13th, 13th, that was last week.
what, we missed it?
june 13 of next year, Mr. Mahone.
next year.
how the hell is that great news?
it usually takes two and a half years for a non-citizen to get before a judge.
I've got a guy in, in here, his name is Michael Scofield and, and he will testify that he set me up and that he put the drugs on the boat.
which will all be taken into consideration... - a year from now!
I'm going to have to ask you to calm down, Mr. Mahone.
it's open and shut.
it's a no-brainer for you.
I got a guy who can cop to... - the notion of one inmate taking the fall for another is not exactly fresh and usually means someone was pressured into the confession.
well, here's the thing, Raul.
I require a certain medication that they, well, they just don't provide here, and I am...
let's just say that it would be good for everybody if, um, if I got this medication.
is that a threat?
no. No, it's a reality, it's, it's...
it's called varatril and, and, and if you...
look, if you are asking me to smuggle drugs into this prison, then...
no, no, I'm not... I'm not asking you to smuggle it.
I'm just saying if you could get... - good luck, Mr. Mahone.
so... wait, you son of a bitch!
uh, boss, it's almost 2: 00.
all right.
you want your cell phone, brother?
no, just be a half hour.
leave it for charge.
if that phone ain't back on the cradle, we're both dead, you hear me?
cause my alabama ass is not going down alone.
yeah?
tell Sara to call me at this number.
all right, but this Susan chick, she hasn't even agreed to it yet, man.
what?
I only have 25 minutes with this phone, Linc.
I'm meeting her right now, but listen, Santa Rita ain't a one-horse town.
I mean, god, I hope that Sara can give us some kind of clue as to where...
just get her on the line. Just get her on the line, okay?
this is a one-shot deal.
Yeah, I know, man.
23 mutes.
I'm nearly there.
Hey, looks like we got off on the wrong foot here.
I'm not a violent guy.
it's just that I need that shoe.
I can't hardly walk, and this place - it changes people.
Oh, I never even got your name.
now, that's just... that's a beautiful name.
what you want then?
well, I was hoping we could make some kind of a deal.
trade.
the only thing you got to sell, me no want to buy.
I like me men a little more... how you say, uh... ?
not fat. - Fat? This is all muscle.
and I'd prove it to you if I didn't think you'd take things south of the border.
now, hold on. This is a negotiation.
you don't have to... - I no gonna cut you.
I got clients.
get.
I'm so honored to have you.
let's make this quick.
where the hell have you been?
well, a girl's got to look her best.
this ain't a game, sister.
you'd better back the hell up.
it's becoming pretty clear you need us, so stop pretending you're in charge, and give us what we want when we want it.
starting with the damn phone call.
Hello?
it's me.
how are you?
I'm tired. Where...?
where are you? - It's a long story.
as it turns out, I don't appear to be going anywhere.
I know. I know.
I'm working on that.
listen, Sara, I miss how we used to talk.
do you remember... how we used to talk?
Yes.
Oh, good.
good, because I saw your picture today, and I want you to know I understand...
I understand the difficult place you're in.
Michael, listen, I... I don't want you to think like that.
why is that?
you have to know it's a lost cause.
LJ and I - we can see it now.
it's a lost cause.
do you understand?
no, no. No, I... I don't. I don't.
help me understand. Help me understand.
all I can think of to help is, maybe you just need more time?
it's like... it's like they're giving you until midnight, and I'm sitting here at 3: 00 A. M.
they're saying I have to hang up.
Sara, I love you.
I love you, too.
Linc, they were never in Santa Rita.
what?
she said it was a lost cause.
she said she could see it was a lost cause.
so?
the patron saint of lost causes is Saint Rita.
she was never telling us where they were.
she was telling us what they could see from where they were.
he's on his way.
we need to get that phone back, like, rapido.
one more thing, Linc.
come on, pretty!
stall them!
she said, it's like they were giving us until midnight, but she was sitting at 3: 00 A. M.
what the hell does that mean?
I don't know.
maybe they're near a clock or something. That's all I got.
listen, I got to go.
it's up to you.
leave him alone, huh?
there's something you should know.
what?
I think that barber might have...
uh... cut me?
no. No. My mistake.
I... you know, in fact, that-that there might just be the best shave I have ever seen.
boy, you look like you need one today.
I might just do that.
can't be walking around, looking all, uh, bhuttu.
who is this?
find out everything you can about this number.
don't move.
I want to know what the hell you're doing to James Whistler.
I'm doing nothing to James Whistler.
listen, we're on the same team, all right?
take it easy.
just... put the knife away.
put the knife away.
put... the knife away.
we're not on the same team.
you want your boy out of Sona, right? Right?
of course.
well, I'm one of the guys who's going to break him out.
no. No. I talked to him this morning.
he has a lawyer.
I don't know what he's told you, or who he is.
I know who he is. - Right.
a fisherman that people want out so badly they're willing to kidnap my son to get him.
listen, you need to talk to him.
where to, my friend?
I'm looking for a statue, a monument.
uh, Santa, Santa Rita.
says it's in here some... - the lady of the lost causes.
Yeah, that's it.
the red light district.
you looking to party? - Yeah.
you all right?
what do you want?
let you know you don't have to watch your back.
make sure I don't have to watch mine.
my head was a free ticket out of here.
don't begrudge anyone who did what they had to do to try and get it.
besides... ...
you, uh, never know when you'll need a friend in this place.
where are you from?
Boardman, Ohio.
Kalbarri.
australia.
good fishing. You've been?
passed through.
small world.
what the hell are you doing in Panama?
I'm not really in the mood.
you're that cop, are you?
you know, I was looking at that Scofield.
I was trying to figure why he looked so bloody familiar.
then, just now, hearing your voice,
I remember watching the press when that first happened.
and now you're in here together.
small world.
you trying to get him out of here?
extradition or what?
I'm not really in that line of work anymore.
what's he all about? Scofield.
I mean, is he dangerous?
what's it to you?
just curious... as to what kind of chap I'm dealing with.
I guess that depends on why you'd be dealing with him.
like I said...
you never know when you'll... - need a friend.
Yeah.
see, one thing about Scofield is that, for those that he cares about, he'll do just about anything.
but he'll screw you three ways to sunday if he doesn't.
I can guess which side you ended up on.
well...
thanks for the chat.
you know, I really just came by...
no, you came by 'cause you wanted to find out more about Scofield, but that's cool.
we're squared away.
there. She is there.
that the only thing about Saint Rita in this town?
that I do not know, my friend.
excuse me? Is there a clock around here?
a clock, uh... no. No comprendo.
excuse me? Have you seen these people? Huh?
no? - No.
clock.
clock.
she said, it's like they were giving us until midnight.
give us till 12.
but she was sitting at 3: 00 A. M.
three...
dad!
dad! Dad! Dad!
Hello?
when?
it was the right place. I just couldn't get to it in time.
did you see them? Do they look all right?
as far as I could tell, yeah.
you can keep that.
keep it as a souvenir and give it to Sara when this is all done.
Michael, we can do this.
they wouldn't have gone to all this trouble to put you in here if it wasn't possible to get out.
we can do this.
we can do it.
I think we need to talk.
your friend, the one in the picture, you say she's the reason you're here?
then we have something in common.
the woman your brother met on the outside, her name is Sofia.
she's the reason I'm here.
well, unless this Sofia is being held at gunpoint, we got nothing in common.
but maybe you can start by telling me why the company's so interested in you.
what company?
I don't have time for games.
okay, okay, look.
look, I've been splitting time between here and the pacific northwest running charters.
fishing? - Fishing, sightseeing
whatever was paying the bloody rent.
now, about a year ago, I took a guy out.
he was some sort of naturalist.
he was, uh... he was taking water samples, measurements.
what for? - I don't know.
I didn't really care as long as the check cleared, but here's the thing.
a few months later, I get a call from somebody wanting to know where I took the guy.
and I told them I couldn't remember.
but then these, um... then these government types, they started showing up at my flat asking questions, and I didn't know what to do.
so I got low, I came down to Panama, and I moin with Sofia full time.
until... - until the fight at the bar.
Yeah, and then I end up here, where those same people show up at visitation saying they're going to get me out.
and when they do, I'm to take them to the same place that I took that guy.
that's why I need the book your brother copped.
it's my trip log.
I write notes in the margins, you know, coordinates, landmarks.
I need to retrace my steps and find that location. I don't have a choice.
that's a really interesting story, but if that book's as valuable as you say it is, maybe I should hold onto it for a little while, make sure they hold up their end of the deal.
you don't get this, do you?
I need time to be able to...
the only thing I'm responsible for is getting you out of here.
whatever's between you and them is between you and them.
I'm sorry.
all right.
do you have any idea how we're going to do this?
all I keep hearing is how no one gets out of this place.
I think I've heard that one before.
the sugarcane's so sweet.
the mangoes' so sweet, the women so...
well, if it isn't the entertainer.
how about a joke for us, boy?
not now, fellas, I got to get...
why don't you do a little dance for us, huh? How about a little jig, huh?
maybe you need an extra hand?
you got me.
Yeah, that's right.
I do get you, boy.
you might've fooled him, but you're not fooling me.
excuse me, boss.
I asked you for privacy.
just came in here to, to... thank you for giving me a hand up in here, but if it's all the same, I'd just like to be relieved of my duties.
what are you talking about?
there's some, um... loyalty issues going on, and I do not want to end up between my fidelity to you and the reality of having to keep my nose clean.
I've been around long enough to know that when the dominoes start falling, it's the new guy that gets blamed for bumping the table.
you better stop spinning and start talking straight.
No!
I ain't no rat.
I'm not asking you to be... a rat.
I'm asking you to be a friend, huh?
as I've been with you.
okay.
I was walking earlier, and I heard some voices talking about, to hell with lechero.
I want my cut.
now, I couldn't tell who it was, but when I got around the corner,
I recognized the faces-- the very same faces I've seen in this room.
now, I got nothing to gain here, okay?
I'm a nobody w-with no hope of being anyone.
but those that surround you have everything to gain if you fall.
I hope this makes us even.
but what I've given you... can't be repaid with one favor.
so I deny your request, and you're going to stay on as my ears.
you'll report back to me everything you hear when I'm not around.
How've you been, Michael?
better than some, apparently.
you know, it's interesting how you don't seem rattled at all by our current accommodations.
could it be because maybe you're not planning on being in them much longer?
it's like I told you before, Alex, this is the end of the line... For both of us.
how about this?
you stop me when I'm wrong.
the company wanted you here in panama alive, but framed for murder, and then for some strange reason, you seemed to really care about the fate of this Whistler guy, and I got to tell you something, he's really curious about you, too.
let's see, what special talents do you have that the company might make the decision that you're worth more to them alive than dead?
huh, what do you say there, Mike? Am letting warm yet?
I think you better pop another pill,'cause that's crazy.
Oh, so you don't mind if I kill him?
I think the question is,"what would the company mind?"
the question is,"what would they do to you?"
to the ones you love?
be careful, Alex.
yeah?
busy day?
not as busy as I'd hoped.
look, you had to try.
I probably would've done the same thing myself if I were you.
but let's be perfectly clear.
you're never going to try anything like that again.
I understand.
Yeah, but just to make sure that you do, I left you a little something in the garage.
it's by the trash.
www. ydy. com proudly presents
I just want to go.
it's okay.
what special talents do you have that the Company might make the decision that you are worth more to them alive than dead?
be careful, Alex.
they will be buried here.
were you able to find my book? Yeah.
but there was this guy.
he took it.
he said to tell you that Scofield's brother has it now.
you have to break them out of there.
Sara!
you're never going to try anything like that again.
but just to make sure,
I left you a little something in the garage.
what's so interesting out there, other than our freedom?
finds are alive, so the fence is dead.
yeah? Everyone in here knows is that fence doesn't work, and it doesn't mean a bloody thing, because there are soldiers out there that'll shoot you dead before you get within 30 yards of it.
well, I guess I got a lot of work to do, don't I?
listen, mate, I get what you're doing with my book.
they hold your girlfriend, you hold what they want.
countering needs. Churchill 101.
soon those bastards are going to ask me what progress I've made in figuring out what they want, and I'm going to say nil, 'cause Lincoln Burrows has the book.
you know what?
threatening the brother of the guy who's supposed to get you out of here might not be the smartest move.
I'm not threatening-- we're on the same team.
but if we play games with that book, people who want me out of here will take ac "I never worry about action, only inaction."
Churchill 101.
now, like I said, I got a lot of work to do.
Linc, you all right?
I'm sorry, man.
just all this stuff-- it's starting to get to me.
you know?
listen, our situation could change very, very soon.
the grave digger for the prison.
I need you to reach out to him.
and tell him what?
it's all written down.
but we got to get started now.
what are you not telling me?
all these people that have been hurt because of me.
I'm so sorry, Michael.
they did this, not you.
okay?
it's not your fault.
just get to the grave digger.
I feel like we're running out of time.
Sara.
I am just a soldier in this war, Lincoln, just like you.
I did not want to do that.
can you even comprehend the intimacy of the mechanics of what I had to do to that woman?
it's horrible!
now, if you and your brother are done playing games,
LJ will be fine.
if not, the last thing I want to do.
but if you push me, eces of him to you.
and not even that far, I will.
I'll do anything you want.
just don't hurt my son.
that's really up to you.
I know the past few days have been hard, for me, as well.
if you want to talk about it,
I know what this pain feels like.
I just want to get your boy out of Sona and get my son back.
Michael's got a plan.
I need details.
we need to bring someone who works at the prison onto the team.
who?
the grave digger.
get it done.
lincoln, I'm going to need that book.
the Company did handwriting analysis on the one you gave me, and yours hasn't changed since high school.
just soldiers, Linc.
different armies, but soldiers just the same.
nice.
I was the best in my school.
all girls?
kiss my ass, bro.
20 bucks says you can't do that again.
bet. Wait.
adjust for wind.
shut up.
just a bit outside.
Hey, bro, you know I don't have that kind of verde lying around.
it's going to take a while.
well, the thing is, I don't have a while.
so, unless... No, no more favors.
all right.
can I borrow that cross of yours?
I'll take it in trade. My dad gave me this.
besides, it's not even real gold.
that's why I need it.
look, I'll give it back, okay?
it's just a loan.
come on.
this time, I want to know why.
it's light again.
someone's getting fat off of everythg I built while I rot in here.
don't get upset.
I only have a few more hours.
let's be nice.
this motherless bitch.
Alex?
you just get here?
Yes.
listen,
I've been thinking about and, uh, you're in.
I'm in.
okay.
just like that? Right.
I really don't have a choice, do I?
what's the plan?
I'm working on it.
meanwhile, I could use your help.
what do you need?
a black felt-tipped pen.
a pen? Yeah.
Why? Some documents that need altering.
I'll explain it to you later, but right now, I need that pen.
okay? Yeah.
and I'll tell you what else I need.
I need you to get your act together.
I need you to bring yourself under control, because you're attracting attention, and that we don't need.
I'm under control.
of course you are.
this is what happens when a system is overloaded.
see? Look.
son of a... Power is out.
fix it.
I'm a truck driver.
Hey, Alex.
Hey, glad I found ya. Just wanted to see how you're holding up in here. Just dandy.
Yeah, well, I've been having a tough time of it myself.
and I was figuring shouldn't be that way for us, seeing as how we're the only lawmen here in Taco Hell.
Hey, whoa, hang on a second there, Alex.
you and me-- we were a team on the outside, remember?
I was your dog, and I still got a lot of bark left in me.
I'm busy, Brad. What do you want?
you and Scofield-- you're up to something, right?
you can tell me, one badge to another.
I can help.
do you have a black felt-tipped pen?
not on me.
then you can't help me.
I know.
you know what?
I know you're trying to escape from here with that man, Scofield.
sweetheart... Please, don't lie to me.
Lincoln Burrows, he told me everything.
there are some very powerful people that want me out of here.
and they want those brothers to get me out. Why?
I'm not sure.
has something to do with a charter I did in Seattle.
what I do know is their end game is exa the same as ours, and that's me out of this hellhole.
and once that happens, you and I will disappear... forever.
but I don't want to involve you in this mess.
I want to help.
that's way too dangerous.
I'm not asking your permission, James.
I'm telling you.
I can do this on my own, or you can tell me what you know and we can work it through together.
I don't understand everything that's going on, but these brothers, they're obviously trying to find out what they can about me.
let's see what we can discover about them.
find out what their plan is, see what they're all about.
they're trying to get you out, and you don't trust them?
I don't trust any of these guys.
and yoshouldn't, either.
if you insist on getting into this, promise me you'll be careful.
because God knows I will die if anything happens to you.
Hey.
Michael.
here.
I said I need a black felt-tipped pen.
that's black.
it's not what I need.
keep looking.
he's playing you.
he's playing you.
do not trust him.
your amigo, the American.
he's a builder, an engineer, no?
he's no amigo of mine, boss.
and trust me, you do not want to get under the covers with that...
is he or is he not an engineer?
well, yeah, but...
Scofield.
yeah?
what do you know about the electricity?
only that we don't have any right now.
let me tell you something.
this phone keeps all the food coming to the gate.
it keeps my business running, it keeps Sona running.
electricity die, phone die.
phone die, we die. We die or you die?
boy, you have enough education, but you're not being smart.
now, I come to you, that is an opportunity.
be wise and take advantage.
now, can you fix the electricity just like you fixed the water?
it's not that simple.
the water pipes are inside the prison.
the electrical lines are probably running underground along an exterior wall, which means they're out there somewhere in no-man's-land.
so, you can fix the power?
last I checked, they shoot prisoners who go out there.
so I'm thinking the answer is "no."
you listen to me, and you listen closely, water boy.
like it or not, soldiers or not, you're going out into no-man's-land.
it's a suicide mission.
I'll make some calls.
and you're going to keep meafe? As best I can.
I don't think I can do this.
no, no, no, no, no. You will help me with this.
look, I will do something for you.
I'll get you a new pillow, goose-feather like mine, or a small TV.
all right.
get me that.
Why? It's the first one to get sunlight in the morning.
you get me that cell, I'll get you electricity.
Hey, Linc.
look, bro, um, I'm going to be out of your way real soon.
I saw these flyers for migrant workers in Colombia.
it's coffee bean season, and they're letting Panamanians in, so I figure, with a good ID, I can pass.
bus leaves today, okay?
all right, well, before you get out of here, man, I...
I'm meeting someone, and I need a translator.
Linc, uh... I appreciate everything you've done...
it'll just be a couple hours.
just a couple hours, that's it.
when I was 15, my cousin told me about a job that only lasts a few hours and, uh, I got three months in juvie.
I can't do this without you.
I'm in Panama, I don't speak the language...
and I can't miss that bus.
I'm going ake money and send it home.
underground or not, I'm going to be a dad, Linc, and you out of all people should understand that.
I spoke to James.
he confirmed what you told me about the escape.
you and I, we both have people in there we care about.
please... let me help you.
your Spanish as good as your English?
Yes, Colonel.
I just have one favor to ask.
it's just outside of the gate.
you, you can bring your men.
the phone dying.
make him one.
this is it?
not everyone has it yet.
we let credit go a week, and there is still time.
the money's in your veins.
no. I don't use anymore. I swear to you.
I swear to you. No.
I swear to you. I swear to you.
chin up, pal o' mine, Chin up.
Colonel.
Yes, thank you, Colonel.
we'll be right there.
come with me.
excuse me. Do you, um...
do you have a-a, a pen?
pen. Not, um...
not... not the brush but the pen. Pen. Pen.
no, pintura.
Yeah, yeah, pintura. Yeah.
he's leaving you.
he's leaving you, he'll be gone, and you'll be stuck in this maze... forever.
thank you for arranging this for us, Colonel.
I'm getting something out of this as well,
I assure you.
you know you can fix this electric problem?
I won't know for sure until we can start digging, but yes, I think so.
my men will shoot you in t back of the head if you so much as look at the fence, eh?
and you, if anything goes wrong.
it will not only be his life that is lost.
you have my word on that.
no worries, Colonel.
I'll keep this boy in line.
I'll dig.
I don't need your help.
Hey, come on, now, don't be proud.
I heard you talking just yesterday.
talking to Mahone.
you know, about how us Americans should stick together.
help me down the road, right, Mike?
what is it, a '66 or a '67?
Erdon? Your car.
66.0
Uh-huh. What is it, 325 horses?
375
375
what's he saying? Recognizes me, but he doesn't realize it was at the prison.
ask him does he want to make enough cash to get this car cherry by next week?
he knows we're not talking about cars.
that's right.
come on, Scofield, I know you're getting out of here.
I heard it all about you and the limey.
I'm just fixing the electricity, Boss.
Yeah, right, and I'm just single cause I'm choosy.
don't make me tell anyone what I know.
what is it you think you know?
somebody called "the Company" wanted you in here to work with that Whistler guy.
am I warm? What's the Company?
what do they want with Whistler?
I don't know, but you do.
doesn't sound like you know much after all.
I don't need to know how to change a diaper to know when it stinks to high hell.
you're doing something here, Scofield.
you're right. I am.
I'm fixing the electricity.
now, you wanted to help dig?
dig.
Hey, this is it.
I assume we're doing more than just than playing electrician.
don't worry.
we're exactly where we need to be.
heat's getting to me, Scofield.
it's quitting time.
you mind telling me why he's even out here with us?
he knows something's up.
how the hell does he know that?
let's just say I have a bit of a rep.
from Fox River?
I know who you are, mate.
figured it out just lately.
finally made sense why they pick you of all people to send here.
no worries.
it's in my interest to keep your little secret.
but Bellick?
can't be trusted.
I can handle Bellick.
he's not in on this.
okay, good.
but Mahone is.
Mahone?
he's looking abouts stable as a three-legged chair, and he's escaping with us?
no, he just thinks he is.
he needs his meds.
without them, he'll self destruct.
it's just a matter of time.
and if he doesn't?
I'll string him along, tell him what he wants to hear, and then I'll cut him loose.
how do I know you're not going to do the same thing to me?
you don't.
you need a hook-up, my friend?
no.
take your time.
I don't hard sell.
my pduct speaks for itself.
outside, I took something.
it's a prescription drug called Varatril, and I was wondering if you...
this ain't no farmacia.
but what I got right here...
it's bter than anything your doctor gave you back in the States.
that's tar.
just take a taste.
you know, keep it in check.
I don't have any money right now.
then I don't have any drugs.
but there are a few ways for a man to make a few dollars in Sona...
servicing the needs of others
not something I'm into...
you think I'm a punk?
I'm just helping you get well, friend, just helping you get well.
ser Lechero?
what do you want?
look, I know you're a busy man, but I wanted to tell ya,
I don't know exactly what he's doing, but Michael Scofield's taking you for a ride. No,
I don't think so.
listen, I heard him talking about escape yesterday
about breaking outta here. It's he's talking about escape, why are you here telling me and you're not going with him, eh?
I would if he'd let me, but he's already cut me out.
he says he's square, but I know the son of a bitch is up to something.
so I figured, if I ain't running, I might asl tell you and make my time in here a little bit easier.
every man fantasizes about escaping from Sona.
Yeah, but they aren't all in no-man's-land with shovels.
I'm gave him the shovels. Get him out.
I gave him shovels too, and guys to work with, just like you.
I worked in the prison he broke out of.
he said he was doing me a favor
fixing damage from a fire he started.
and you know what I got?
hog-tied and left in a pipe under my own prison.
there's nothing he can do.
the soldiers are watching him.
that's what I thought, until he tunneled out ofy guard's room.
he's buried something in a junction box out there and covered it with dirt-- I saw him.
go see for yourself.
if I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.
trouble keeps finding you here in Sona, doesn't it?
let's take a walk, eh?
there are rumors about that you are trying to trick me.
I'm just doing what I'm told.
Oh? Let's hope for your sake that's true.
Hmm?!
but just make sure, let's go on out to no-man's-land and see what you buried there.
just want to make sure my men are doing a good job for the colonel.
get in there.
get in there.
open it.
move the dirt.
now!
it's duct tape.
to fix the frayed wires.
that's why the power was so inconsistent.
I didn't want the tape to come loose, so I packed it down with dirt.
beautiful.
where are you going?
I got to turn the main power switch back on.
I had to turn it off, so we could work on the wires safely.
I'll come with you.
it's just a switch.
I can handle it myself.
you can... but you won't.
Hey, water boy, it's back here.
I don't need the chain, just the cross.
it's the perfect size and it's not real gold, so it won't conduct current.
keep the circuit open
no power even when the main switch is turned on.
take the cross out...
Sona lights up again.
Lechero find out you messed with his electric...
you're dead.
that's why he can't ever find out.
now, don't make me come get you.
nobody back there can help you.
uh, it's...
it's some kind of mistake.
it should be working.
the only mistake I made was trusting you.
transformer delay.
it's an old prison.
now, if you don't mind...
I'd like to move into my new cell.
thank you for your words before, blanco.
working for Lechero, not an easy field to plow, comprende?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I comprend.
you and me, we're amigos, Nieves.
when Lechero is in a better mood,
I'm going to put in a goodord, help you, how you say,"move up the ladder."
I appreciate it, compadre, but I was always taught that God helps those that help themselves.
$15, 000...
Why? Because that's what he wanted.
relax. I'll get you the money.
and I will meet you there. Okay.
how are you holding up?
I just want to get this done.
good.
stay here.
I'm coming with you. Stay here.
you expect me to stay here and wait? I don't care what you do.
you don't care? Who the hell are you to say you don't care?
you're not the only one affected by this.
Yeah, I know; that's the problem.
but you will still just run off and do whatever you want?
what kind of a man are you that just...
they killed Sara and put her head in a box!
and they've got my son!
Oh, Linc, I'm... I'm sorry.
you still here?
Lechero wants to talk to you.
I was just about to get a little trim.
Lechero said I was looking all bhuttu!
it'll wait.
did you know about this?
did you know anything about this?!
me? No! No! Nieves...
Nieves-- we was friends, man.
that's right!
if you knew he was using and didn't tell me...
his death is on your head.
I don't know nothing about drugs.
I don't. I don't.
I mean, hell, I...
I tried me some reefer when I was 12,
I almost coughed up a lung.
good.
that's good.
teodoro.
there appears to be an opening on my crew.
mcgrady, here's your cross back.
and, uh... thank you.
you're a real smart guy.
what the hell are you doing in prison?
here.
it's perfect.
how did you get it?
it's what you wanted, right?
Yeah.
good work.
so what's the next step?
uh... we wait.
and... I'll keep you posted.
you know what you need to do.
what do you think?
when I fix electricity for reason, but it can't have been to make that fence sizzle like the third bloody rail.
unless you want to make the colonel happy.
actually, it's in both of our best to make that fence as deadly as possible.
now all we have to do is wait for my brother to come through with the grave digger.
this is good for a start.
but I want more.
he wants more.
you said $15, 000.
you said $15, 000!
fifteen to listen.
you said $15, 000! You said $15, 000!
we got it, Linc! I got it!
I want big cash understand?
calm down if it's money you want.
no, no, no!
what the hell are you doing?!
we need him! He will sell us out to the cops after he takes as much as he can from us.
he's packing up to go.
kill him.
he's going to betray you. Kill him.
good news, Agent Mahone!
due to the untimely demise of Ser Juan Nieves,
I have now been promoted manager in charge of retail distribution and customer liaison.
get away from me.
all in due time.
now, I'm not your momma, and I ain't one to wipe other's noses, but let's just say you've looked better.
I want nothing from you.
but sure seems you need something.
on the arm.
no strings attached.
get your head straight, Alex.
come on in, man.
come watch the match. Come.
Oh, yeah. You guys call this football down here, right?
very good, very good.
it's World Cup-- football without the silly hats you wear in America, where they all jump on t each other like a bunch of batty boys.
have a seat.
come.
teodoro.
caf?
the only thing I hate more than a rat is a rat with bad information.
Yeah, look, I'm sorry about all that, but my information was good.
it's just that Scofield is a tricky bastard.
he'll try something again. You'll see.
wait! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
come on, you guys. What are you doing to me?
come on! I gave you good information!
Scofield's planning to escape! I'm telling you!
he's a smart bastard!
come on, you guys. Come on. What are you doing?
no. No.
No! No.
look, I gave you good information.
U said something this morning about, "If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'."
just be thankful I don't hold you to that.
come on, Bagwell.
help me here, man! Come on.
Bagwell!
you left this in your old cell.
Thanks, Alex.
you're welcome.
it's funny that you could forget something as important as this is.
well, I'm glad you found it for me.
Yeah.
Oh. Oh, look.
you are breathing only by my grace, Michael.
now, you remember the next time that you're going to send me on a goose chase.
okay? I didn't.
no, no. You did.
and you think you can manipulate me, just like you did to Sucre... and Tweener and Haywire.
I'm not your errand boy.
I'm going to go with you when you escape, and if you think, in any way...that you'll leave me,
I will put this piece of metal right in that very small space right between your eyes. I will.
how's LJ? How's Sara?
they told me they're fine.
listen, uh, the grave digger is gone.
what do you mean, he's gone?
Linc, we can't do this without him.
we know, we know, that's why we went to his supervisor
the guy who approves any hires for that job.
turns out he could use some cash.
Oye, man. Mail call.
this is we're getting out?
Yes.
with a little help from an old friend.
what is that?
it's a chemical that kills the odors caused by decomposing bodies.
and when heated to a certain degree...
...it eats through steel.
LJ and sara will be traded for whistler.
are we clear?
this can't be done in a week.
you have a week.
that's it.
no one's ever broken out of this place before, let alone with a week to plan, so you tell these people
I'm gonna break this guy out of here or I'm going to die trying.
you're going to stay on as my ears.
you'll report back to me everything you hear when I'm not around.
I know you've got a brother helping on the outside,
I know he ran into my girlfriend, and I know he took a book from her that belongs to me.
this is what they took from me.
so let's be clear, this is what matters to me.
not you.
and not your book.
how's lj? How's sara?
they told me they're fine.
what are you not telling me?
you're not the only one affected...
they killed Sara and put her head in a box!
and they got my son!
you're running out of time
what's that?
a rat
J. P.Getty had a formula for success.
rise early, work hard strike oil.
just trying get a drink of water, alex.
as a devoted student of your work and skills,
I-I really look forward to progress on your plan, michaeL.
I'm looking forward to you getting off my back.
Buenos, welcome to sona.
is that your wallet?
Dame tu billetera.
you know what I said.
no.
that's the wrong answer.
I am so ready to get out of here anytime you are.
Scofield, visita.
you look like you had a long night.
Yeah.
I spent most of it feeding chocolate to a rat.
I don't have a whole lot to work with these days.
she's got the book, man, the bird guide.
she worked it out. - So we have no leverage.
no.
tell me something. When you were handing over the book, did you ask for a recent photo of lj and sara?
Yeah.
and where is it?
she showed me the pictures, but she wouldn't let me keep them.
man, I'm not in a position to bargain with these people.
I mean, they're pissed.
you break out tomorrow.
let's just focus on that. Let's keep on track.
all right.
while I'm working from the inside,
I need you to take care of what happens once we're outside.
we're going to need a getaway vehicle, something inconspicuous.
whatever you find, it has to be parked a half mile from here by 3: 00 P. M.Tomorrow.
you mean A. M. - No, I mean P. M.
we don't have a choice, linc.
I ran some tests last night.
military jeeps patrol the perimeter at night.
there's no way of telling where they're going to be in theark.
they were out there all night.
we need the dark, we can't just... - Just...
please.
because we're doing this tomorrow.
in the middle of the day.
who're you looking at?
that guy.
I know him.
mcgrady, my friend, I'm going to need a watch.
maybe two.
I'm not even going to ask why.
I'm also going to need some binoculars.
old guillermo has a pair.
there's no way he'll sell them to you, man.
but they shouldn't be hard to get.
where can I find this guy?
we leave tomorrow.
this...
this is how we're getting out of sona.
getting out of the cell block shouldn't be a problem.
the grate and bars are weak, but we're going to need some kind of rope, some kind of ladder, to let us down on the other side.
that's why I figured out the safest line from here to the hole in the fence.
we do it in the day, we'll only be visible to the two guard towers.
the perimeter guards are less predictable, but they're only on at night.
scurrying across the field in the middle of the day?
it's the only way to avoid the jeep patrol.
now, in the yard tomorrow, there's a soccer game at 2: 00.
that should provide some distraction inside.
and yesterday when we were digging,
I saw the glare from the sun hit this guy in the late afternoon.
looked like he turned away, like maybe his vision was blocked.
it's not much of a break.
no, but it is one way to do what we need to do.
as far as this other guard, his weakness has yet to be determined.
if we're going to get around these guys, we've got to get to know them.
it's not going to be easy.
there's only one real road that goes to the prison.
we don't want a real road-- that's not an option.
what?
your brother's cutting it close. - You said a week.
tomorrow's wednesday, you didn't leave much room for error.
there's not going to be an "error.
listen, I've got a lot of stuff to do and I just...
which is why I won't waste your time.
when whistler's free, I need to get to him as soon as possible.
I'm still trying to work out what's going to happen once they get past the fence.
once I know all the details, I'll let you...
lincoln, calm down.
it sounds to me like you and your brother are in over your heads.
there's a bad joke about sara somewhere in there.
listen...
I'll let you know all the details once I know them, and then I'll call you.
I want this to work out just as badly as you do.
more, I'm sure.
lj's fine. You have 34 hours.
what did she say?
nothing we don't already know.
let's get out of here; we got a lot of stuff to do.
Mr. Rivera?
who?
you're Jorge Rivera, right?
gravedigger at Sona?
so?
would you like a ride?
someone's coming to get me in a little bit
I had an arrangement with your predecessor
I need you to get this inside the prison
I don't go inside the prison
neither did he.
how about this?
you find a way to get this delivery, just this one time
why would I?
because I would give you five thousand dollars
five thousand dollars
for just one time?
couldn't you do that?
I think you could do it
in this?
you're crazy
only you can do it
I wouldn't let 'em see you do that.
who? - Anyone.
it's a drinking fountain. They put their lips right on there.
you'd think it spits straight jack daniels.
you understand what happened, don't you?
you're a-- what's-it- called?-- A pariah.
I made the same mistake when I walked in here tried to hang on to my wallet.
next thing I knew, I spent the next two days kneecap deep in human feces.
in sona, it's every man for himself.
here, cheese.
I'm not hungry.
Yeah, you will be.
I saw the other americans.
so none of you have called the embassy, huh?
us gringos ain't all butt buddies. You want it?
cause I'll keep it.
let's get this done. We're gonna have to watch both guards simultaneously.
your cell should provide a good view of the guard I saw yesterday.
keep track of everything he does and when he does it.
look for that glare, see if it shows up again.
what will you be doing?
watching the other tower from here.
while our back's turned, we're gonna need a lookout.
well, find mahone.
I thought we were stringing him along?
looks like we're out of string.
what they say about all work and no play, huh?
boy need his rest.
your clientele keeps a tight schedule.
got to make sure I see to their needs.
I gave you a more important task.
but I haven't heard a thing.
then listen harder.
mi amor.
Ah, mi vida.
into my office.
excuse me anything yet?
Nope, not yet.
so what's your story, man?
I mean, the next chapter, when we get out of here.
suppose you were married to the job, drank too much, rabid insomniac, typical lawman.
Yeah, just like you reek of live bait, have a girl in every port, tell fish stories or so I've heard.
prior to this experience, I had the utmost respect for the law.
this guy hasn't so much has scratched his jock in an hour.
it's not gonna be easy to get around that guy.
I don't know.
we might just have a break.
I'm gonna go check on scofld.
sorry.
did you see the glare?
hit him hard at 3: 13
he turned to his right and ignored everything to the west for six minutes, as far as I could tell.
this guy thinks he's auditioning for buckingham palace.
he's also a sports fan.
he's got a tv.
twice in the last four hours the signal went fuzzy.
he had to turn to adjust the antennae.
that's nothing we can count on.
true.
but there is a device we can build out of some pretty common materials.
it's almost like a radio, except it...
transmits signals.
pardon me.
you're the new guy.
Yeah.
and who are you? - Not the new guy. So what's your deal?
public intoxication, tourist in trouble-- What is it?
I don't like people asking too many questions.
when I've done nothing wrong - Oh, you're an innocent man.
as a matter of fact, yes.
is this your first time in prison?
Uh-huh. Why?
because it's obvious-- rule number one:
you mind your own business. You hear me?
you know, you might want to do the same.
you know exactly what I'm talking about. You got me?
Yeah. - Yeah.
I got it - Go take a walk.
When'd you meet your boyfriend, whistler?
my last year of school.
I worked in this place in san isabel.
he used to come around by himself and sit down in a bar.
hitting on the waitress. That's romantic
he is!
every time he goes away, he brings me back a present.
like this.
those are from sedona.
his mother lives there in a retirement home.
what's going on?!
out of the car, Juan Bobo! - What's going on?!
this is a private road.
I can explain. - Callete!
What'd we do? - Shut your mouth, american.
this is state property! No vehicles allowed!
all roads within two miles of sona are closed.
we, we didn't see any signs. - Where were you going?
San isabel? - Yeah.
this your car? - Is my car there's papers in the glove box
this is why my friends don't visit Panama you cops bother everyone
this road is not for tourists.
if I ever catch you out here again, I'll remember you.
it ain't gonna happen again. - Okay, go on.
anda.
you okay? - Yeah.
this is not gonna work. - Where's the coast from here?
I don't know, maybe three miles. - All right, time for plan B. Come on.
found some more of these. We can make rope out of this hammock.
come on. You don't want to go in there.
if you want to get out of this place I do.
stay here.
Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Move it!
come on!
what is it, chained down?
it's hanging by a thread.
it'll have to wait.
it's 4: 30.
we've got less than 24 hours. - We'll make it.
tell me why. - What?
what's so urgent we can't get you out of here the day after tomorrow?
I don't know. I don't have all the answers.
you don't me, I don't know you, but it's your job to get me out of here.
we'll come back later.
I'll take this as well.
down here for the summer? - Yep.
that's what I thought, back in 1985.
two wives, 20 years later.
want everything in here?
Yeah, thanks.
international waters far out?
that's 12 nautical miles.
12 nautical miles, huh?
is that gonna do it here? - Uh, yeah.
$99. 25.
here. - All right.
thank you.
what did you get? - Supplies.
can you pop the trunk, please?
who am I gonna tell, honestly?
you could be a russian spy for all I know.
live out of this thing?
I have to be prepared in case of an emergency.
well, we got an emergency.
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me where we're going.
solana beach.
Why?
they killed sara.
I'm trying to make damn sure they don't kill my son.
you don't think for a second your boy's not on that list, stay here.
I couldn't care less.
what is it?
it's...
Augusto.
he won't pay the payment for you anymore.
I went to him for payment like every monday, and...
he said it's not his responsibility and that I should ask you.
no, no, no, no.
you tell augusto I don't pay for sex.
I know, I did.
but...
what I do?
I don't see anyone else...
yeah?
well, neither do I.
Hey!
on the other side, when we get out of here, what's gonna happen?
we're gonna meet someone from this company...
apparently.
and then they're gonna kill me.
you know that.
if they wanted to kill you, you'd already be dead.
I don't see why they keep me alive.
it's like you said-- you've got something they want.
once I give it to them, I'll be no use to them.
right?
I don't have all the answers.
all I know is it's my job to get you out of here.
let's go.
it's twofer tuesday, my one-time special just for you.
but there's a price.
Lecho's getting pretty sensitive about the cash flow.
well, I'm a little short right now.
no worries, alex.
I am not gonna leave you hanging, all right?
we can just start you a tab.
think he saw us? - Guess we'll find out.
my third year in school, we studied electrical engineering with a focus on emps.
that's electromagnetic pulses.
if you hook up a power source to a transmitter, it generates a pulse.
that pulse crashes anything electronic.
what's that, like an intro an intro into anti-terrorist tactics?
basically.
these days, they have to teach students how to defend their structures.
fortunately for us, that guard tower is...
it was engineered a long time ago.
I'm guessing you always won the elementary science fair.
plug this in.
did it crash the telly?
we're too far away.
but it is doing exactly what we need it to.
okay.
get out!
Why? - They're coming in.
Ahora mismo.Stay here.
do not let them see her. Do not!
Colonel.
we received no word of this!
a rifle scope was seen from the tower.
capitan hurtado saw it with his own eyes.
that's impossible.
there is a gun in your prison, and it was pointing at one of my men. We are going to find it.
this looks good.
for what?
have a seat.
what am I supposed to doing here?
look like you're hav when was the last time you saw your son?
you know, lincoln, I don't automatically trust people either, but at least I can tell when they have good intentions.
good for you.
you know, I'm not gonna try to prove myself anymore.
you do your job, and I'll do mine.
you need something?
what? - You need something?
no. - Good.
don't you worry. It's all gonna be okay.
no, it's not.
I promise you, I will not let anyone find you in here.
Lechero hate me.
Lechero does not hate you.
you hold a very special place in his heart.
so many girls can take my place.
no, he's smart. He knows you're better than them.
you're a real woman.
a woman of her own will, her own desire.
you know what I am.
in this world, sister, we are all prostitutes.
you are a queen.
whose cell is that? In the corner?
is that your cell?
you! Is that your cell?
it's mine!
it's mine.
it's mine.
I found this.
it's not a weapon.
I know what it is.
why were you watching me?
I'm going to ask you one more time.
why were you watching me?
I wasn't watching you.
I saw you.
answer the question!
I don't know what you think you saw, but I wasn't watching you.
cinco.
cinco.
I wasn't watching you.
Cuatro.
Tres!
it's mine!
why were you watching him?
I...I wasn't. I was, uh...
I was watching birds.
Yes.
Yes.
see?
why did you not speak up before?
I, uh...
I was scared.
I was scared.
coward
ya. Dejelo.
come on.
come on!
please, please, please.
come on.
he's coming back up here.
now, don't worry.
it's all going to be okay.
you have a little scara right there.
you need to look pretty for lechero.
thank you.
wait right here.
a patrol passed through, but they didn't stay.
knocked some things over then walked away.
I hid your woman in a safe place, but I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a close call.
is she alone?
Yeah.
Hey.
don't be afraid.
no, no, my dear.
they're gone.
I should go, too.
no, no, no. What's the rush?
come on. - No, I should get home.
Patr, I gave her the money.
I was going to replace it mysf at the end of the day, when I get my cut.
I just didn't get a chance to tell you.
she had no money to get home.
is this true?
Yes.
with all due respect.
surely you don't want your mistress travelin' broke.
she'd end up in a taxi with no way to pay the cab fare.
Ah, you did this?
for me?
Si, patr.
the one that does all the useful things for me, huh?
and now you do the thinking for me.
no, no, it's not like that, patr - - get the bucket.
wash my feet.
so what do we do now?
I don't know.
well, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
please just give me a moment to think.
wasting time is not an option for me, michael.
I need to be out of here by tomorrow.
I know, just in time for your next fishing trip, or is it a bird-watching trip? I forget.
that's my trip log, I've told you.
I need to retrace my steps.
I'm doing everything they tell me, the same thing you are.
just, just leave me alone, please.
you know, before I was arrested, a man came to my flat and took my addresses.
they know the name of everyonI care about and how to find them.
well, they already found everyone I care about. Okay?
because time is running out.
huh?!
look, it's hot today.
Yeah.
prefer the heat than the cold any day.
you know my brother and I wanted to come down here to panama and start a dive shop like the one we were at today.
my boy, he was gonna leave school and help us start the family business.
when this is all over, why don't you do it?
too much bad stuff's happened.
still, you can make it work.
it's only gonna work if...
if whistler cooperates.
if he plays games, people get hurt.
you understand that, right?
he doesn't want anyone to get hurt.
I hope you're right.
I want to show you something.
our getaway vehicle.
now, the next time you see him, I want you to tell him what you saw.
tell him we're all in this together.
we're part of a team.
you understand?
okay. Yeah.
all right, get up.
we're coming back.
okay. No, this way.
this way, come on.
OK
if all goes well, we'll see them tomorrow.
we got to replace everything we lost. Like what?
for starters, a new exit point.
it's got to be on the south side of the building.
look at this guy, again.
Hey!
I know you, huh? - Afraid not.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
you're mcfadden, right?
nice, 1997?
sorry.
you've confused me with someone else.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I swear.
you were with the ambassador.
you've mistaken me for someone else.
chap's insane.
come on, guys, got something to show you.
I'm sure I didn't observe the guards' behavior in as much detail as you guys, but I did notice something yesterday.
right around this time.
that's the day shift.
they start up at 6: 00.
just keep looking, keep looking.
there.
Where'd you get your cup, alex?
I got it in the courtyard, but apparently it's from him.
he has one in the morning and one after lunch.
man's got to have his fix.
if we get to that cup...
we get to the man.
LJ and sara will be traded for Whistler are we clear?
this can't be done in a week.
you have a week. That's it.
no one's ever broken out of this place before, let alone with a week to plan, so you tell these people I'm gonna break this guy out of here or I'm going to die trying.
you're going to stay on as my ears.
you'll report back to me everything you hear when I'm not around.
I know you've got a brother helping on the outside,
I know he ran into my girlfriend, and I know he took a book from her that belongs to me.
this is what they took from me.
so let's be clear, this is what matters to me.
not you.
and not your book.
how's LJ? How's Sara?
they told me they're fine.
what are you not telling me?
you're not the only one affected...
they killed Sara and put her head in a box!
and they got my son!
you are running out of the time what's that?
a rat.
J. P. Getty had a formula for success.
rise early, work hard, strike oil.
just trying to get a drink of water, Alex.
as a devoted student of your work a skills, I-I really look forward to progress on your plan, Michael.
I'm looking forward to you getting off my back.
Buenos, welcome to Sona.
is that your wallet?
Dame tu billetera.
no hablo Espal, uh?
you know what I said.
no.
that's the wrong answer.
I am so ready to get out of here anytime you are.
Scofield, visita.
Scofield, you have a visitor.
you look like you had a long night.
Yeah.
I spent most of it feeding chocolate to a rat.
I don't have a whole lot to work with these days.
she's got the book, man, the bird guide.
she worked it out.
so we have no leverage.
no. -Tell me
when you were handing over the book, did you ask for a recent photo of LJ and Sara?
Yeah.
and where is it?
she showed me the pictures, but she wouldn't let me keep them.
man, I'm not in a position to bargain with these people.
I mean, they're pissed.
you break out tomorrow.
let's just focus on that.
let's keep on track.
all right.
while I'm working from the inside, I need you to take care of what happens once we're outside.
we're going to need a getaway vehicle, something inconspicuous.
whatever you find, it has to be parked a half mile from here by 3: 00 p. m. tomorrow.
you mean a. m.
no, I mean p. m.
we don't have a choice, Linc.
I ran some tests last night.
military jeeps patrol the perimeter at night.
there's no way of telling where they're going to be in the dark.
they were out there all night.
we need the dark, we can't just... just...
please.
because we're doing this tomorrow.
in the middle of the day.
who're you looking at?
that guy.
I know him.
mcgrady, my friend, I'm going to need a watch.
maybe two.
I'm not even going to ask why.
I'm also going to need some binoculars.
old Guillermo has a pair.
there's no way he'll sell them to you, man.
but they shouldn't be hard to get.
where can I find this guy?
we leave tomorrow.
this...
this is how we're getting out of Sona.
getting out of the cell block shouldn't be a problem.
the grate and bars are weak, but we're going to need some kind of rope, some kind of ladder, to let us down on the other side.
that's why I figured out the safest line from here to the hole in the fence.
we do it in the day, we'll only be visible to the two guard towers.
the perimeter guards are less predictable, but they're only on at night.
scurrying across the fld in the middle of the day?
it's the only way to avoid the jeep patrol.
now, in the yard tomorrow, there's a soccer game at 2: 00.
that should prove some distraction inside.
and yesterday when we were digging,
I saw the glare from the sun hit this guy in the late afternoon.
looked like he turned away, like maybe his vision was blocked.
it's not much of a break.
no, but it is one way to do what we need to do.
as far as thisther guard, his weakness has yet to be termined.
if we're going to get around these guys, we've got to get to know them.
it's not going to be easy.
there's only one real road that goes to the prison.
we don't want a real road-- that's not an option.
what?
your brother's cutting it close.
you said a week.
tomorrow's Wednesday, you didn't leave much room for error.
there's not going to be an "error."
listen, I've got a lot of stuff to do and I just...
which is why I won't waste your time.
when Whistler's free, I need to get to him as soon as possible.
I'm still trying to work out what's going to happen once they get past the fence.
once I know all the details, I'll let you...
lincoln, calm down.
it sounds to me like you and your brother are in over your heads.
there's a bad joke about Sara somewhere in there.
listen...
I'll let you know all the details on I know them, and then I'll call you.
I want this to work out just as badly as you do.
more I'm sure.
LJ?
lj's fine. You have 34 hours.
what did she say?
nothing we don't already know.
let's get out of here; we got a lot of stuff to do.
seir Rivera?
who?
you're Jorge Rivera, right?
gravedigger at Sona?
so?
would you like a ride?
no no, someone's coming to get me in a little bit.
I had an arrangement with your predecessor.
I need you to get this inside the prison.
I don't go inside the prison.
neither did he.
how about this?
you find a way to get this delivery inside the prison just this one time.
why would I?
becuase I would give you five thousand dollars.
five thousand dollars?
for just one time?
couldn't you do that?
I think you could do it.
in this?
you're crazy!
only you can do it.
I wouldn't let 'em see you do that.
who?
anyone. It's a drinking fountain.
they put their lips right on there.
you'd think it spits straight Jack Daniels.
you understand what happened, don't you?
you're a-- what's-it- called?-- a pariah.
I made the same mistake when I walked in here tried to hang on to my wallet.
next thing I knew, I spent the next two days kneecap deep in human feces.
in Sona, it's every man for himself.
here, cheese.
I'm not hungry.
Yeah, you will be.
I saw the other Americans.
so none of you have called the embassy, huh?
us gringos ain't all butt buddies.
you want it? Cause I'll keep it.
let's get this done.
we're gonna have to tch both guards simultaneously.
your cell should provide a good view of the guard I saw yesterday.
keep track of everything he does and when he does it.
look for that glare, see if it shows up again.
what will you be doing?
watching the other tower from here.
while our back's turned, we're gonna need a lookout.
well, find Mahone.
I thought we were stringing him along?
looks like we're out of string.
teodoro.
Si, patron?
what they say about all work d no play, huh?
boy need his rest.
your clientele keeps a tight schedule.
got to make sure I see to their needs.
I gave you a more important task.
but I haven't heard a thing.
en listen harder.
mi amor.
Ah, mi vida.
into my office.
sit down, watch the game.
excuse me.
anything yet?
Nope, not yet.
so what's your story, man?
I mean, the next chapter, when we get out of here.
suppose you were married to the job, drank too much, rabid insomniac, typical lawman.
Yeah, just like you reek of live bait, have a girl in every port, tell fish stories or so I've heard.
prior to this experience,
I had the utmost respect for the law.
this guy hasn't so much has scratched his jock in an hour.
it's not gonna be easy to get around that guy.
I don't know.
we might just have a break.
I'm gonna go check on Scofield.
sorry.
did you see the glare?
13-- he turned to his right and ignored everything to the west for six minutes, as far as I could tell.
this guy thinks he's auditioning for Buckingham Palace.
he's also a sports fan.
he's got a TV.
twice in the last four hours the signal went fuzzy.
he had to turn to adjust the antennae.
that's nothing we can count on.
true.
but there is a device we can build out of some pretty common materials.
it's almost like a radio, except it...
transmits signals.
pardon me.
you're the new guy.
Yeah. And who are you?
not the new guy.
so what's your deal?
public intoxication, tourist in trouble-- what is it?
I don't like people asking too many questions.
when I've done nothing wrong.
Oh, you're an innocent man.
as a matter of fact, yes.
is this your first time in prison?
Uh-huh. Why? Because it's obvious
rule No. 1
you mind your own business.
you know, you might want to do the same.
you know exactly what I'm talking about.
you got me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got you.
go take a walk.
When'd you meet your boyfriend, Whistler?
my last year of school.
I worked in this place in San Isabel.
he used to come around by himself and sit down in a bar.
hitting on the waitress. That's romantic.
he is!
every time he goes away, he brings me back a present like this
those are from Sedona.
his mother lives there in a retirement home.
what's going on?!
out of the car, Juan Bobo!
this is a private road.
I can explain. Callete!
What'd we do?
shut your uth, American.
U? paso
this is state property! No vehicles allowed!
all roads within two miles of Sona are closed.
we, we didn't see any signs.
where were you going?
San Isabel.
San Isabel? Yeah.
this your car?
it's my car.
the papers in the glove box.
this is why my friends don't visit Panama.
you cops bother everyone.
this road is not for tourists.
if I ever catch you out here again,
I'll remeber you.
it ain't gonna happen again.
okay, go on.
anda.
you okay?
Yeah. This is not gonna work.
Where's the coast from here? I don't know, maybe three miles.
all right, time for plan B. Come on.
found some more of these.
we can make rope out of this hammock.
come on. You don't want to go in there.
if you want to get out of this place I do.
stay here.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
move it!
come on!
what is it, chained down?
it's hanging by a thread.
it'll have to wait.
30
we've got less than 24 hours. We'll make it.
tell me why. What?
what's so urgent we can't get you out of here the day after tomorrow?
I don't know. I don't have all the answers.
you don't me, I don't know you, but it's your job to get me out of here.
we'll come back later.
I'll take this as well.
down here for the summer? Yep.
that's what I thought, back in 1985.
two wives, 20 years later.
want everything in here?
Yeah, thanks.
international waters far out?
that's 12 nautical miles.
12 nautical miles, huh?
is that gonna do it here?
uh, yeah.
$99. 25.
here.
all right.
thank you.
what did you get?
supplies. Can you pop the trunk, please?
who am I gonna tell, honestly?
you could be a Russian spy for all I know.
live out of this thing?
I have to be prepared in case of an emergency.
well, we got an emergency.
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me where we're going.
solana Beach. Why?
they killed Sara.
I'm trying to make damn sure they don't kill my son.
you don't think for a second your boy's not on that list, stay here.
I couldn't care less.
what is it?
it's... Augusto.
he won't pay the payment for you anymore.
I went to him for payment like every Monday, and...
he said it's not his responsibility and that I should ask you.
no, no, no, no.
you tell Augusto
I don't pay for sex.
I know, I did.
but... what I do?
I don't see anyone else...
yeah?
well, neither do I.
you in charge of the food now?
no boss. I'm the new gravedigger.
you need to sign in before you get on the truck.
I was just about to.
have you read the rulebook?
Yes, sir.
read it again.
on the other side, when we get out of here, what's gonna happen?
we're gonna meet someone from this mpany...
apparently.
and then they're gonna kill me.
you know that.
if they wanted to kill you, you'd already be dead.
I don't see why they keep me alive.
it's like you said-- you've got something they want.
once I give it to them, I'll be no use to them.
right?
I don't have all the answers.
all I know is it's my job to get you out of here.
let's go.
it's twofer Tuesday, my one-time special just for you.
but there's a price.
Lechero's getting pret sensitive about the cash flow.
well, I'm a little short right now.
no worries, Alex.
I am notgonna leave you hanging, all right?
we can just start you a tab.
think he saw us?
guess we'll find out.
my third year in school, we studied electrical engineering with a focus on EMPs.
that's electromagnetic pulses.
if you hook up a pow source to a transmitter, it generates a pulse.
that pulse crashes anything electronic.
what's that, like an intro an intro into anti-terrorist tactics?
basically. These days, they have to teach students how to defend their structures.
fortunately for us, that guard tower is...
it was engineered a long time ago.
I'm guessing you always won the elementary science fair.
plug this in.
did it crash the telly?
we're too far away.
but it is doing exactly what we need it to.
okay.
get out! Why?
they're coming in.
Ahora mismo.
stay here. Do not let them see her.
do not!
Colonel.
we received no word of this!
a rifle scope waseen from the tower.
capitan Hurtado saw it with his own eyes.
that's impossible.
there is a gun in your prison, and it was pointing at one of my men.
we are going to find it.
this looks good.
for what?
have a seat.
what am I supposed to doing here?
look like you're having fun.
when was the last time you saw your son?
you know, Lincoln,
I don't automatically trust people either, but at least I can tell when they have good intentions.
good for you.
you know, I'm not gonna try to prove myself anymore.
you do your job, and I'll do mine.
you need something?
what? You need something?
no.
good.
don't you worry. It's all gonna be okay.
no, it's not. I promise you, I will not let anyone find you in here.
Oh... Lechero hate me.
Lechero does not hate you.
you hold a very special place in his heart.
so many girls can take my place.
no, he's smart. He knows you're better than them.
you're a real woman.
a woman of her own will, her own desire.
you know what I am.
in this world, sister, we are all prostitutes.
you are a queen.
whose cell is that?
in the corner?
is that your cell?
you
is that your cell?
it's mine!
it's mine.
it's mine.
I found this.
it's not a weapon.
I know what it is.
why were you watching me?
I want to ask you one more time.
why were you watching me?
I wasn't watching you -- I saw you.
answer the question!
I don't know what you think you saw but I wasn't watching you.
lie!
I wasn't watching you.
it's mine.
why were you watching him?
I... I wasn't. I was, uh...
I was watching birds.
Yes.
Yes.
see?
why did you not speak up before?
I, uh...
I was scared.
I was scared.
coward.
Hurtado! Ya. Dejelo.
come on.
come on!
please, please, please.
come on.
he's coming back up here.
now, don't worry.
it's all going to be okay.
you have a little mascara right there.
you need to look pretty for Lechero.
thank you.
wait right here.
a patrol passed through, but they didn't stay.
knock some things over then walked away.
I hid your woman in a safe place, but I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a close call.
is she alone?
Yeah.
Hey.
don't be afraid.
no, no, my dear.
they're gone.
I should go, too.
no, no, no. What's the rush?
come on. No, I should get home.
Patr,
I gave her the money.
I was going to replace it myself at the end of the day, when I get my cut.
I just didn't get a chance to tell you.
she had no money to get home.
is this true?
Yes.
with all due respect.
surely you don't want your mistress travelin' broke.
she'd end up in a taxi with no way to pay the cab fare.
Ah, you did this?
for me?
Si, patr.
teodoro.
the one that does all the useful things for me, huh?
and now you do the thinking for me.
no, no, it's not like that, patr
get the bucket.
wash my feet.
so what do we do now?
I don't know.
well, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
please just give me a moment to think.
wasting time is not an option for me, Michael.
I need to be out of here by tomorrow.
I know, just in time for be out your next fishing trip, tomorrow.
or is it a bird-watching trip? I forget.
that's my trip log, I've told you.
I need to retrace my steps.
I'm doing everything they tell me, the same thing you are.
just, just leave me alone, please.
you know, before I was arrested, a man came to my flat and took my addresses.
they know the name of everyone I care about and how to find them.
well, they already found everyone I care out. Okay?
if you can't get me out of here, tell me now.
because time is running out.
huh?!
look, it's hot today.
Yeah.
prefer the heat than the cold any day.
you know my brother and I wanted to come down here to Panama and start a dive shop like the one we were at today.
my boy, he was gonna leave school and help us start the family business.
when this is all over, why don't you do it?
too much bad stuff's happened.
still, you can make it work.
it's only gonna work if... if Whistler cooperates.
he plays games, people get hurt.
you understand that, right?
he doesn't want anyone to get hurt.
I hope you're right.
I want to show you something.
our getaway vehicle.
now, the next time you see him,
I want you to tell him what you saw.
tell him we're all in this together.
we're part of a team.
you understand?
okay. Yeah.
all right, get up.
we're coming back.
no, this way.
what?
this way, come on.
okay
if all goes well, we'll see them tomorrow.
job well done. Thank you.
I thought you said I was gonna get five thousand dollars.
that's what I'm talking about.
no, no, no, no, no.
you said one time.
was it difficult?
that's not the point.
one time is one time.
this can work out for both of us.
if we're gonna do this today, we got to replace everything we lost.
like what?
for starters, a new exit point.
it's got to be on the south side of the building.
look at this guy, again.
I know you, huh?
afraid not. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
you're McFadden, right?
nice, 1997?
sorry.
you've confused me with someone else.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I swear.
you were with the ambassador.
you've mistaken me for someone else.
chap's insane.
come on, guys, got something to show you.
I'm sure I didn't observe the guards' behavior in as much detail as you guys, but I did notice something yesterday.
right around this time.
that's the day shift.
they start by 6: 00
just keep looking, keep looking.
there.
Where'd you get your cup, Alex?
I got it in the courtyard, but apparently it's from him.
he has one in the morning and one after lunch.
man's got to have his fix.
if we get that cup...
we get to the man.
we got to move.
LJ and sara will be traded for whistler.
are we clear?
this can't be done in a week.
you have a week.
that's it.
no one's ever broken out of this place before, let alone with a week to plan, so you tell these people
I'm gonna break this guy out of here or I'm going to die trying.
you're going to stay on as my ears.
you'll report back to me everything you hear when I'm not around.
I know you've got a brother helping on the outside,
I know he ran into my girlfriend, and I know he took a book from her that belongs to me.
this is what they took from me.
so let's be clear, this is what matters to me.
not you.
and not your book.
how's lj? How's sara?
they told me they're fine.
what are you not telling me?
you're not the only one affected...
they killed sara and put her head in a box!
and they got my son!
you're running out of time
what's that?
a rat
J. P.Getty had a formula for success.
rise early, work hard strike oil.
just trying get a drink of water, alex.
as a devoted student of your work and skills,
I-I really look forward to progress on your plan, michaeL.
I'm looking forward to you getting off my back.
Buenos, welcome to sona.
is that your wallet?
Dame tu billetera.
you know what I said.
no.
that's the wrong answer.
I am so ready to get out of here anytime you are.
Scofield, visita.
you look like you had a long night.
Yeah.
I spent most of it feeding chocolate to a rat.
I don't have a whole lot to work with these days.
she's got the book, man, the bird guide.
she worked it out. - So we have no leverage.
no.
tell me something. When you were handing over the book, did you ask for a recent photo of lj and sara?
Yeah.
and where is it?
she showed me the pictures, but she wouldn't let me keep them.
man, I'm not in a position to bargain with these people.
I mean, they're pissed.
you break out tomorrow.
let's just focus on that. Let's keep on track.
all right.
while I'm working from the inside,
I need you to take care of what happens once we're outside.
we're going to need a getaway vehicle, something inconspicuous.
whatever you find, it has to be parked a half mile from here by 3: 00 P. M.Tomorrow.

where can I find this guy?
we leave tomorrow.
this...
this is how we're getting out of sona.
getting out of the cell block shouldn't be a problem.
the grate and bars are weak, but we're going to need some kind of rope, some kind of ladder, to let us down on the other side.
that's why I figured out the safest line from here to the hole in the fence.
we do it in the day, we'll only be visible to the two guard towers.
the perimeter guards are less predictable, but they're only on at night.
scurrying across the field in the middle of the day?

did you see the glare?
hit him hard at 3: 13
he turned to his right and ignored everything to the west for six minutes, as far as I could tell.
this guy thinks he's auditioning for buckingham palace.
he's also a sports fan.
he's got a tv.
twice in the last four hours the signal went fuzzy.
he had to turn to adjust the antennae.
that's nothing we can count on.

When'd you meet your boyfriend, whistler?
my last year of school.
I worked in this place in san isabel.
he used to come around by himself and sit down in a bar.
hitting on the waitress. That's romantic
he is!
every time he goes away, he brings me back a present.
like this.
those are from sedona.
his mother lives there in a retirement home.
what's going on?!
out of the car, juan bobo! - what's going on?!
this is a private road.
I can explain. - Callete!
What'd we do? - Shut your mouth, american.
this is state property! No vehicles allowed!
all roads within two miles of sona are closed.
we, we didn't see any signs. - Where were you going?
San isabel? - Yeah.
this your car? - Is my car there's papers in the glove box
this is why my friends don't visit Panama you cops bother everyone
this road is not for tourists.
if I ever catch you out here again, I'll remember you.
it ain't gonna happen again. - Okay, go on.
anda.
you okay? - Yeah.
this is not gonna work. - Where's the coast from here?
I don't know, maybe three miles. - All right, time for plan B. Come on.
found some more of these. We can make rope out of this hammock.
come on. You don't want to go in there.
if you want to get out of this place I do.
stay here.
Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Move it!
come on!
what is it, chained down?
it's hanging by a thread.
it'll have to wait.
it's 4: 30.
we've got less than 24 hours. - We'll make it.
tell me why. - What?
what's so urgent we can't get you out of here the day after tomorrow?
I don't know. I don't have all the answers.
you don't me, I don't know you, but it's your job to get me out of here.
we'll come back later.
I'll take this as well.
down here for the summer? - Yep.
that's what I thought, back in 1985.
two wives, 20 years later.
want everything in here?
Yeah, thanks.
international waters far out?
that's 12 nautical miles.
12 nautical miles, huh?
is that gonna do it here? - Uh, yeah.
$99. 25.
here. - All right.
thank you.
what did you get? - Supplies.
can you pop the trunk, please?
who am I gonna tell, honestly?
you could be a russian spy for all I know.
live out of this thing?
I have to be prepared in case of an emergency.
well, we got an emergency.
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me where we're going.
solana beach.
Why?
they killed sara.
I'm trying to make damn sure they don't kill my son.
you don't think for a second your boy's not on that list, stay here.
I couldn't care less.
what is it?
it's...
Augusto.
he won't pay the payment for you anymore.
I went to him for payment like every monday, and...
he said it's not his responsibility and that I should ask you.
no, no, no, no.
you tell augusto I don't pay for sex.
I know, I did.
but...
what I do?
I don't see anyone else...
yeah?
well, neither do I.
Hey!
you no you i have yes read
on the other side, when we get out of here, what's gonna happen?
we're gonna meet someone from this company...
apparently.
and then they're gonna kill me.
you know that.
if they wanted to kill you, you'd already be dead.
I don't see why they keep me alive.
it's like you said-- you've got something they want.
once I give it to them, I'll be no use to them.
right?
I don't have all the answers.
all I know is it's my job to get you out of here.
let's go.
it's twofer tuesday, my one-time special just for you.
but there's a price.
Lecho's getting pretty sensitive about the cash flow.
well, I'm a little short right now.
no worries, alex.
I am not gonna leave you hanging, all right?
we can just start you a tab.
think he saw us? - Guess we'll find out.
my third year in school, we studied electrical engineering with a focus on emps.
that's electromagnetic pulses.
if you hook up a power source to a transmitter, it generates a pulse.
that pulse crashes anything electronic.
what's that, like an intro an intro into anti-terrorist tactics?
basically.
these days, they have to teach students how to defend their structures.
fortunately for us, that guard tower is...
it was engineered a long time ago.
I'm guessing you always won the elementary science fair.
plug this in.
did it crash the telly?
we're too far away.
but it is doing exactly what we need it to.
okay.
get out!
Why? - They're coming in.
Ahora mismo.
stay herE.
do not let them see her. Do not!
Colonel.
we received no word of this!
a rifle scope was seen from the tower.
capitan hurtado saw it with his own eyes.
that's impossible.
there is a gun in your prison, and it was pointing at one of my men.
we are going to find it.
this looks good.
for what?
have a seat.
what am I supposed to doing here?
look like you're hav when was the last time you saw your son?
you know, lincoln, I don't automatically trust people either, but at least I can tell when they have good intentions.
good for you.
you know, I'm not gonna try to prove myself anymore.
you do your job, and I'll do mine.
you need something?
what? - You need something?
no. - Good.
don't you worry. It's all gonna be okay.
no, it's not.
I promise you, I will not let anyone find you in here.
Lechero hate me.
Lechero does not hate you.
you hold a very special place in his heart.
so many girls can take my place.
no, he's smart. He knows you're better than them.
you're a real woman.
a woman of her own will, her own desire.
you know what I am.
in this world, sister, we are all prostitutes.
you are a queen.
whose cell is that?
in the corner?
is that your cell?
you! Is that your cell?
it's mine!
it's mine.
it's mine.
I found this.
it's not a weapon.
I know what it is.
why were you watching me?
I'm going to ask you one more time.
why were you watching me?
I wasn't watching you.
I saw you.
answer the question!
I don't know what you think you saw, but I wasn't watching you.
cinco.
cinco.
I wasn't watching you.
Cuatro.
Tres!
it's mine!
why were you watching him?
I...I wasn'T. I was, uh...
I was watching birds.
Yes.
Yes.
see?
why did you not speak up before?
I, uh...
I was scared.
I was scared.
coward
ya. Dejelo.
come on.
come on!
please, please, please.
come on.
he's coming back up here.
now, don't worry.
it's all going to be okay.
you have a little scara right there.
you need to look pretty for lechero.
thank you.
wait right here.
a patrol passed through, but they didn't stay.
knocked some things over then walked away.
I hid your woman in a safe place, but I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a close call.
is she alone?
Yeah.
Hey.
don't be afraid.
no, no, my dear.
they're gone.
I should go, too.
no, no, no. What's the rush?
come on. - No, I should get home.
Patr, I gave her the money.
I was going to replace it mysf at the end of the day, when I get my cut.
I just didn't get a chance to tell you.
she had no money to get home.
is this true?
Yes.
with all due respect.
surely you don't want your mistress travelin' broke.
she'd end up in a taxi with no way to pay the cab fare.
Ah, you did this?
for me?
Si, patr.
the one that does all the useful things for me, huh?
and now you do the thinking for me.
no, no, it's not like that, patr - - get the bucket.
wash my feet.
so what do we do now?
I don't know.
well, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
please just give me a moment to think.
wasting time is not an option for me, michael.
I need to be out of here by tomorrow.
I know, just in time for your next fishing trip, or is it a bird-watching trip? I forget.
that's my trip log, I've told you.
I need to retrace my steps.
I'm doing everything they tell me, the same thing you are.
just, just leave me alone, please.
you know, before I was arrested, a man came to my flat and took my addresses.
they know the name of everyonI care about and how to find them.
well, they already found everyone I care about. Okay?
because time is running out.
huh?!
look, it's hot today.
Yeah.
prefer the heat than the cold any day.
you know my brother and I wanted to come down here to panama and start a dive shop like the one we were at today.
my boy, he was gonna leave school and help us start the family business.
when this is all over, why don't you do it?
too much bad stuff's happened.
still, you can make it work.
it's only gonna work if...
if whistler cooperates.
if he plays games, people get hurt.
you understand that, right?
he doesn't want anyone to get hurt.
I hope you're right.
I want to show you something.
our getaway vehicle.
now, the next time you see him,
I want you to tell him what you saw.
tell him we're all in this together.
we're part of a team.
you understand?
okay. Yeah.
all right, get up.
we're coming back.
okay. No, this way.
this way, come on.
OK
if all goes well, we'll see them tomorrow.
job i five that no, no, no, no, no.
you - was - that's one this
if we're gonna do this today, we got to replace everything we lost.
like what?
for starters, a new exit point.
it's got to be on the south side of the building.
look at this guy, again.
Hey!
I know you, huh? - Afraid not.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
you're mcfadden, right?
nice, 1997?
sorry.
you've confused me with someone else.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I swear.
you were with the ambassador.
you've mistaken me for someone else.
chap's insane.
come on, guys, got something to show you.
I'm sure I didn't observe the guards' behavior in as much detail as you guys, but I did notice something yesterday.
right around this time.
that's the day shift.
they start up at 6: 00.
just keep looking, keep looking.
there.
Where'd you get your cup, alex?
I got it in the courtyard, but apparently it's from him.
he has one in the morning and one after lunch.
man's got to have his fix.
if we get to that cup...
we get to the man.
we got to move.
did you ask for a recent photo of LJ and Sara?
Yeah.
where is it?
she showed me the pictures, but she wouldn't let me keep them.
all right.
I want to know who this guy is.
said his name was Sullins.
Alex, thanks for coming in.
Hello, Lang.
what's going on?
there's all kinds of suits over here going through your office.
I know you, huh? - Afraid not.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
you're Mcfadden.
you've confused me with someone else.
you were with the ambassador.
you don't know me, I don't know you, but it's your job to get me out of here.
you break out tomorrow. By 3: 00 P. M.
you mean A. M. - No, I mean P. M.
we're doing this tomorrow...in the middle of the day.
the ring.
wise decision.
want the ring, brother?
that's more your style, man.
Hey, hey, hey. It's all right, it's all right.
you all go on back.
go ahead.
no, go ahead.
a word.
you should try and be more careful in the future.
Yes, sir.
Hey.
Hey.
what's your name?
the Australian.
you said you knew him from Nice.
is that true?
you calling me a liar now?
he says you're full of it.
he said he was never an ambassador.
no, not an ambassador, the ambassador.
I was concierge at the ambassador hotel.
I could've sworn he worked there for a few months.
who the hell knows, huh?
I was high half the time.
kind of why I got fired.
kind of why I'm in here.
what was he up to in Nice?
what?
you writing a book?
we're leaving at 3: 13-- that gives us three hours 41 minutes.
and we still don't have a way into no-man's-land.
I'll take care of that.
I just need to check it out first.
and the fence?
your grave digger friends only sprayed the thing once, and I'd just as soon not get electrocuted today.
would I feel better if Sucre had sprayed the fence again? Yes.
is that an option? No.
unless he had another reason to be there.
what are you going to do?
kill someone to get more spray on the fence?
I'd think about killing you if it helped us get out of here today.
you know what'll help us get out of here?
a ladder.
where are we gonna go once we get through that fence?
just get me a ladder.
this hammock's shorter than the last one.
well, we might need something to extend it.
all right, I'll take care of it.
I've never been to Nice.
I hear it's beautiful.
I wouldn't know.
I don't care if this guy knows you or not.
but what I do care about is his apparent fixation with watching you at all times.
we'll be out of here soon enough.
he won't be a problem.
Hey, buddy, check it out.
do they roll bones in your country?
come to my cell, I'll teach you.
U want me to come back to your cell and roll bones？Real subtle.
hardy har-har.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's hilarious.
tell me, are you this friendly with all the shirtless guys in Sona?
I gave you food yesterday.
I gave you a place to sleep.
I wonder why.
what the hell is your problem?
look, I just don't want to have sex with you, okay?
is that so hard to believe?
get a plate.
to make it across no-man's-land, we're going to have to disable two of the tower guards.
I've already taken care of one of them.
with the other one, we're going to need your help.
every day between 1: 00 and 2: 00, he takes his lunch break.
he gets a cup of coffee.
you need to find out where and put something in that cup.
make sure he's unconscious during the escape.
you're dropping this on me with three hours to go?
I don't know what to tell you.
3: 13 is when it starts.
we'll be on the beach by 3: 25.
in broad daylight.
the company still thinks we're doing this at 9: 00 tonight, right?
listen, I can't lie to these people anymore, Michael.
we need time to survey the transfer site, to figure out if we can get LJ and Sara out of there in case they try something.
you got the gun?
Yeah, I got the gun.
how's LJ? How's Sara?
they're fine.
what about the pictures?
I can't get pictures.
I need them, Linc.
I can't get the pictures.
how do we know they're still alive?
they're the only reason I'm doing this.
Susan says they're fine. Just trust her.
you're the one who's always telling me we can't trust anybody.
now you're...
you're vouching for this person?
there isn't enough time.
listen, if I don't see pictures of LJ and Sara by 2: 30 this afternoon,
I'm not going anywhere.
can't seem to find American cheese down here.
I hope you like Asadero.
Yeah. It's perfect.
a couple of years ago, I was serving in Mosul.
and I was taken prisoner.
a few nights later of U. S. army helicopters.
two clicks and closing.
my hands were still tied behind my back, and I...I ran.
it didn't occur to me that if this was a rescue mission, my captors could hear the choppers.
it didn't occur to me that this was actually a hostage exchange, and that my jumping would be viewed as a hostile act.
I got recaptured immediately.
six rangers died in the firefight.
and for the next three weeks...
let's just say men are pigs.
let's be clear.
this is an exchange.
if you don't try to be a hero, you and your father will be okay.
okay?
okay.
good.
eat.
Norman?
as you can imagine, he prefers Lechero.
he kill you before or after he does your taxes.
kill you when he pleases.
I'm feeling thirsty.
why don't you go fix us something to drink, boy?
maybe you ain't got the memorandum, but I've been promoted.
boy.
what did you say to me? Hmm?
what's the problem?
stumpy here and his mouth.
that's the problem.
I'm calling him out right now!
I'll talk to him.
leave.
this isn't over.
leave!
we was just, uh...
no, no, no.
the favor you owe me...
what have you found out?
a thing like this takes time.
I can't just walk up to them and say, "hey, whoever's been betraying Lechero, raise your hand." You know?
I asked you to be my ears in this prison, and you hear nothing?
all I know is every time I try and sit down and begin sussing things out, Sammy always changes the subject.
not that I'm saying he's the guy, but...
I don't want to hear your theories.
I want results.
is everything okay?
is James all right?
Yeah, he's fine.
where is this from?
Uribe's, the roadside bodega a few kilometers away.
if I needed you to id a specific guard
a tower guard-- could you do it?
I just don't want to get busted.
could you do it or not?
Yes.
Lincoln? - Yeah.
what is it? - I need something.
Teodoro's harmless, man.
he's a...He's a clown.
he's a dead clown.
Hey, man, I wasn't going to say anything, but, uh, last night, I was looking for my playing cards and guess what?
I found these.
you're holding out on me.
take 'em.
they taste nasty.
man, you cannot get a better cigar than this.
Where'd you get these?
I can't make him stop sending them in to me, but I don't work for him, you understand?
you sure you don't mind?
I was in the neighborhood.
you came all this way to visit?
I came to get you out of here.
I can have you in Schaum correctional facility in 48 hours.
in St. Louis.
Sullins wanted a medium security, but, uh, talked him down.
what sort of deal is he getting me?
25 years?
life?
the director's giving us a lot of latitude in exchange for testimony against the government in the lincoln burrows conspiracy.
so...
how does eight years sound?
soon as Sullins finishes up, we can have a van ready...
I don't think so.
what?
I appreciate the effort, your effort, but, um, I can't do eight years.
you're doing ten now.
the government is calling in some favors.
once you're in the U. S.
if you don't cooperate, they're going to charge you with everything.
that's multiple homicide counts.
without this deal, you are gonna be in prison for the rest of your life.
I appreciate the effort, your effort.
but I can't.
while we're getting out of here, and...
if I don't make it, will you make sure this gets to my girlfriend?
all right.
you know, uh...
I could do the same for you.
tie an anchor bend there.
I was just offering.
you know what, if I'm the one who doesn't make it, and you really want to do me a favor, just hold up your end of the bargain.
I'll do everything I can.
I hope that's true.
how's that knot coming?
there.
did I pass your test?
I told you I'm a fisherman.
where are we?
I found a cell that'll get us into no-man's-land.
it's a longer run to the fence than my old one, but it's gonna have to do.
which one? Who lives there?
Papo, Cheo and Sammy.
look, I know what you're thinking, but it's the only other cell on the second floor with a direct line to the fence, where we won't be seen the other tower guards.
and how do we guarantee that they won't be there?
by 2: 00, everyone should be out in the courtyard for the lunchtime soccer game.
you sure it hasn't started already?
someone went outside the ring to settle a dispute.
now, anyone who affronts our justice system in this way must be punished.
now, I know the coward won't come forward.
but if anyone has information about this shameful act, I demand to know.
let's go, Menudo. - Why?
Lechero wants you.
move your ass.
now, every day I see you out in the yard, you play your American sports and wear your American clothes.
I don't think I've heard you speak one word of Spanish since you've been here.
I like to practice my English.
and why shouldn't you?
america is a great nation.
one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
is that right?
Yes.
Yes.
justice for all.
justice for you and justice for me.
and justice for...whoever killed that blanquito in the yard.
now, I know why you didn't say anything out there.
but you play your silly American games all day long, right in front of the stairs where the body was found.
now, if you don't tell me what you saw, there will be consequences.
well, I-I saw one person go into the stairwell.
a-and then maybe a minute later, I heard an argument.
who did you see?
so after we tie the cord off...
we dig out the bar, we pop open the grate, and we're, and we're down, right, Michael?
does anyone want to say anything about what we just saw out there?
what is there to say?
well, for starters, an hour ago, you say maybe we should kill someone and then someone gets killed.
I didn't say that, and this is exactly what we should be focusing on right now.
let's spend a couple of hours worrying about another dead body in this hellhole.
what do you want?
what are you doing?
Lechero wants to see you.
I don't have any information.
he doesn't want information.
he wants a confession.
I didn't do anything.
listen to him; he's innocent.
you want to confess?
you can easily switch places.
maybe now we should start worrying about who the real killer is, huh?
Yeah, but in this place, there could be a hundred people on that list.
except I'm thinking a single stab wound to the base of the neck looks pretty professional, Alex.
I was in visitation, Kojak.
and what makes you so sure that Whistler didn't do it?
he's the one that had the run-in with the guy.
no, he's got too much to lose.
well, Whistler's gone, and if not now, he probably will be soon, so it's you and me.
there's no you and me.
we're not leaving here without him.
in two hours, I'm going out that window and through that fence.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, that's right.
and where are you going to go to, Alex?
anywhere but here.
there's only one road out, and the jungle is under constant patrol by police 24-7, so, again, where are you going to go to, Alex?
3: 13, I'm gone.
I told you I know nothing about this.
I shouldn't...
I shouldn't be here.
I can promise you I, I did not kill that man.
someone saw you go down the staircase.
stair...
is there any other proof?
my men will find something.
well, do you see a weapon on me?
I didn't expect to see a weapon on you.
well, w-why don't they look for that?
you find that, you'll find the real killer.
or maybe they find where you planted it.
so, what, I'm framing someone?
well, did it ever occur to you that someone might be framing me?
who would bother?
you know the reason I'm here.
you know I have powerful enemies.
you think my judgment is swayed by the mayor's friends?
sit your ass down.
when I was 13, my mother worked for a wealthy man as a maid until one day...
she was alone in the house...
with him and he...
everybody knew what he did, but because he was rich and we were immigrants, the police wouldn't even take a report.
so, a week later, to gain access through his gates,
I dressed as a milkman-- a Lechero
and I made sure that fair punishment was rendered.
now you want to tell me how I favor the rich.
I understand the rules here, and I respect them.
but why the rush to judgment?
is there a rule saying you must convict a suspect within ten minutes?
no.
we have all the time in the world.
thank you.
now, obviously, I'm not going anywhere.
if you need to talk again, I'm gonna be in my cell.
no.
you'll be right here in this chair.
what the hell do you want?
I don't like you.
I certainly don't respect you.
stop. You're hurting my feelings.
I've seen what you're capable of, but I got to say I never pegged you as a murderer.
you think I killed Tyge?
I saw the two of you in the courtyard this morning.
I was trying to be nice to him.
he started with me.
well, if you didn't kill him, who did?
not me.
come on, Brad.
who wanted him dead besides you?
you really think I killed that frog?
how many times have I had you at gunpoint?
you think I didn't want to pull that trigger?
hell...
I can't even kill myself.
Hey, you seen anyone see Whistler go down the stairway?
we only been out here a minute.
well, hurry up, then.
the sooner Whistler dies, the sooner I can give you the chicken foot, or if you prefer, you can give me the chicken foot.
you know, try and go out like a man.
either way, you're getting in the ring with me today.
it's used to anesthetize dogs.
two drops, and the guard should be out within an hour.
I was expecting Whistler's girlfriend to join you.
where is she? Around the corner in the car?
she came to me.
I don't mind that she's helping you.
I mind that you kept it from me.
what difference does it make?
I mean, we're done by tomorrow, right?
no more surprises, Lincoln.
what? Say it.
can you get any more pictures of Sara?
alive? No.
you didn't tell him.
you didn't tell Michael that Sara's dead.
can we get pictures or not?
I'm sure we can cobble something together, but smart move not telling your brother.
he seems a little sensitive to me.
this is the exchange point-- LJ and I will be waiting.
you, Michael and Whistler will meet us there.
everything goes as planned, you'll have your son back by 9: 00.
which one is it?
I don't know, I think it's the taller one.
the other one is always drinking orange juice.
you sure? - I think so,
I'm not completely sure, but they all look the same.
we there's
I was come on.
you ?
get juice.
please.
watch where you're going!
here, look, uh...
this is a buddy's, please. Please, I insist.
new coffee - No really. - Toma, Toma.
man, I...thank you anyway.
I need to go to Sona.
I...My car's run out of gas and
sorry. I'm-I'm heading in the wrong, wrong direction.
I really need to go to Sona.
thank you.
watch the lid.
my condolences.
you finally make a friend, and now he's about to die.
damn shame.
you can stop it, you know.
if you hadn't noticed, my position enables me to hear things.
I'm listening.
the only proof Lechero's got is that your man went down that staircase, right?
what if you had more compelling evidence?
well, I don't.
but if you did...
you're suggesting I make something up?
if it makes your conscience feel better, then blame it on somebody who deserves it.
someone who's killed before and gone unpunished.
Yeah, like you maybe.
you want me to tell Lechero that his right hand man should die?
you don't tell Lechero squat.
Lechero knows this is Sammy's ring.
if you drop it in the blood by the staircase, then yell up to Lechero what you've found...
the whole entire prison will hear clear-cut evidence of Sammy's guilt.
Lechero will have no choice but to comply.
this is Sona.
don't you worry your pretty little head about it.
all you have to do is drop the ring in the blood and say it was Sammy.
I'll take care of the rest.
you want to save your friend's life?
someone else has to die.
explain your disagreement with this Tyge man.
from what I just heard, he knew something about you?
he thought he knew something about me.
opportunity and a motive. That's not a good combination.
you must know there's discontent from many prisoners over how you run Sona.
now would not be a good time to insult me.
no. No, no, my point is this: You execute me, you get your swift justice and you may placate the masses.
but when they find out who really did it...
they will know you killed an innocent man.
you're still not answering my question.
what was your disagreement with tyge?
he was a nosy guy. He got into my business.
I'm sure he did the same with someone else, and that's what got him killed.
would you just admit that you had an argument?
this is prison.
if someone makes false cusations, I can't back down.
you must respect that.
look, I've answered every one of your questions.
I've acquitted myself the best that I can.
now what can I do to make you trust me?
I don't trust anybody today.
you you
I mean
what's?
I Sona.
and your love.
could in this car.
Yeah. - We have the picture.
how does it look?
it looks like Sara.
I'll be at Sona in half an hour.
meet me in the parking lot.
is everything okay?
hold on, hold on, hold on.
don't man?
I but
Norman - Norman? Norman St. John? - Yes!
you girls? - Yes!
I'm waiting.
there was a complication with the guard.
complications drugging the guard?
Yeah, but it's been taken care of.
well, that's encouraging, but why are you drugging the guard now when you're escaping tonight?
well, it takes that long for the drugs to work...
they take an hour, like I told you.
you are getting sloppy, Alex.
what are you talking about?
is this is a joke?
I stopped hiding things under my mattress a long time ago.
did you find that under my mattress?'Cause if you did somebody put it there.
you're gonna have to do better than that.
Really? Did you find some fingerprints on it? Huh?
did you get some fibers?
what are you gonna do take it to the Sona crime lab?
they got Whistler nailed for walking into the wrong stairwell.
I'm thinking this is enough to get you guys to switch places.
you know what I mean?
what does that mean, huh? What does that prove?
it proves everything!
I'm gonna make sure Lechero thinks so, too.
Michael, I did not kill that man.
I did not kill the man.
what's, what's going on?
is everything okay?
what the hell you doing? Huh?
what's that for?
your father tried to be a hero.
no, no.
Hey, please, please.
please, no, stop!
once I cut the spinal cord and the sever nerve endings, you won't feel a thing.
no, no...
Susan, I'm sorry.
we didn't mean to do that.
dad, they're gonna kill me.
what? LJ?
Yeah, they got a knife to my throat.
Susan, don't you hurt- - Dad...
the truth. - Truth.
Michael's getting out at 3: 13.
we're meeting at the exchange point at 3: 45.
Susan, please, we did this because we wanted to make sure the site was safe.
that's it, that's the only reason why we did it.
sounds to me like you're planning another end round. Another rescue.
no, no. We're not, we're not planning, we're not planning another end round.
no. Please, just...let my son go.
leave my son.
Wow. Living the good life, huh?
is that what this is?
having too good a time here to contemplate leaving?
I needed some time to think.
well, I needed some time to finalize our agreement with the Panamanians, but instead I get dragged down here.
Yeah, I'm sure it was really hard to convince you to come down here.
I'm gonna be honest.
I was looking forward to seeing you down here like this, but now that I'm here, I, uh, wouldn't wish this on anyone.
can we just save all this till after...
I don't know if we can or not. Made up your mind yet, Alex?
eight years, minimum security.
I got 'em down to four.
and I leave for the U.S. tonight?
once the special prosecutor clears you, you'll be on your way.
what about a special prosecutor?
you stand in front of a guy, you, you tell your story and he determines if you're gonna be a useful and credible witness.
it's a formality.
it's a formality"?
this is just a formality?
you know, if it were up to me, you could rot in here for the rest of your life.
but the justice department is extremely motivated to get to the bottom of this president Reynolds business.
Alex, this is a hundred percent abovboard.
you've made a lot of mistakes in your career.
you know it and I know it, intentional or otherwise.
I've got eight files in my office attesting to that.
and if you don't take this offer, then I assure you it would be the biggest mistake of your life.
I know who killed that man.
I'm sure you do. Lechero!
what do we have here?
I found this in Alexander Mahone's cell.
convenient!
to blame this on a man who can't even be questioned.
enough of this already. Cheo!
get the prisoner up.
it's time.
you know Whistler didn't do this.
he just said he found the shank in Mahone's cell?
doesn't that prove I'm innont?
yore a joke!
you talk about equality.
you talk justice, but at the end of the day you're a dictator, and just like any dictator you're terrified of losing your power.
it'd be very unwise to go any further.
you don't care who the real killer is just as long as you get to string somebody up.
that's all that matters to you, isn't it?
I've determined who's guilty, and the punishment is death.
you're making a mistake.
this is murder!
you know it and I know it!
at least have the guts to admit it!
you're right!
it's murder.
don't!
I found this in the yard.
augusto used to give them to me as tribute.
and now you reek of them.
go.
okay?
it's sad...
one of you.
he will be okay.
I question your love for your son.
he was two seconds away from being decapitated because of you.
I told you the truth.
maybe.
but if you have anything else planned, now it's scrapped.
because, what happens if you try something?
I know. - Oh, good.
this is the same newspaper she was holding in the last picture.
that's what my guy could get.
you didn't give me a lot of time.
you think Michael's not going to notice this?
Yeah.
Hey, Michael, here's the pictures.
he's going to want to see this close up.
I'm done doing favors for you.
get out. I'll see you in an hour.
no football today?
no, no football today.
you're my brother, Sammy?
of course.
Michael: It's done?
the guard will be asleep in a half hour.
so we're good.
not quite.
they, uh, they know we're breaking out this afternoon.
you told her?
= Man, she worked it out... - why didn't you lie?
she worked it out.
so what are we gonna do to get the upper hand here, Linc?
nothing. - You think they're just going to turn over LJ and Sara?
this is too dangerous.
if we try anything, they're just going to...
what, hurt them?
no, not if they want us to deliver on whistler, they won't.
we're playing this one straight. No games. No surprises.
all right?
show me the pictures.
show me the pictures, Linc.
come on...the pictures.
I can't show you the pictures, man.
why not, Linc?
she's dead, Michael.
I lied to you.
I'm sorry.
if you don't break out today, they're going to kill my son.
they're going to kill LJ.
Michael, we've got to do this.
Michael, we've got to do this!
Sara's dead. They killed her.
Oh, man, I'm so sorry.
I loved her and...
now she's gone.
and it's all because of you.
what?
Hey, take it easy.
Wh...what?
this is your fault.
he's told me his grievance.
this fight is going to happen.
just think about what you're doing.
I have.
did you ask for a recent photo of LJ and Sara?
Yeah.
where is it?
she showed me the pictures, but she wouldn't let me keep them.
all right.
I want to know who this guy is.
said his name was Sullins.
Alex, thanks for coming in.
Hello, Lang.
what's going on?
there's all kinds of suits over here going through your office.
I know you, huh? - Afraid not.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
you're Mcfadden.
you've confused me with someone else.
you were with the ambassador.
you don't know me, I don't know you, but it's your job to get me out of here.
you break out tomorrow. By 3: 00 P. M.
you mean A. M. - No, I mean P. M.
we're doing this tomorrow...in the middle of the day.
the ring.
wise decision.
want the ring, brother?
that's more your style, man.
Hey, hey, hey. It's all right, it's all right.
you all go on back.
go ahead.
no, go ahead.
a word.
you should try and be more careful in the future.
Yes, sir.
Hey.
Hey.
what's your name?
the Australian.
you said you knew him from Nice.
is that true?
you calling me a liar now?
he says you're full of it.
he said he was never an ambassador.
no, not an ambassador, the ambassador.
I was concierge at the ambassador hotel.
I could've sworn he worked there for a few months.
who the hell knows, huh?
I was high half the time.
kind of why I got fired.
kind of why I'm in here.
what was he up to in Nice?
what?
you writing a book?
we're leaving at 3: 13-- that gives us three hours 41 minutes.
and we still don't have a way into no-man's-land.
I'll take care of that.
I just need to check it out first.
and the fence?
your grave digger friends only sprayed the thing once, and I'd just as soon not get electrocuted today.
would I feel better if Sucre had sprayed the fence again? Yes.
is that an option? No.
unless he had another reason to be there.
what are you going to do?
kill someone to get more spray on the fence?
I'd think about killing you if it helped us get out of here today.
you know what'll help us get out of here?
a ladder.
where are we gonna go once we get through that fence?
just get me a ladder.
this hammock's shorter than the last one.
well, we might need something to extend it.
all right, I'll take care of it.
I've never been to Nice.
I hear it's beautiful.
I wouldn't know.
I don't care if this guy knows you or not.
but what I do care about is his apparent fixation with watching you at all times.
we'll be out of here soon enough.
he won't be a problem.
Hey, buddy, check it out.
do they roll bones in your country?
come to my cell, I'll teach you.
U want me to come back to your cell and roll bones？Real subtle.
hardy har-har.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's hilarious.
tell me, are you this friendly with all the shirtless guys in Sona?
I gave you food yesterday.
I gave you a place to sleep.
I wonder why.
what the hell is your problem?
look, I just don't want to have sex with you, okay?
is that so hard to believe?
get a plate.
to make it across no-man's-land, we're going to have to disable two of the tower guards.
I've already taken care of one of them.
with the other one, we're going to need your help.
every day between 1: 00 and 2: 00, he takes his lunch break.
he gets a cup of coffee.
you need to find out where and put something in that cup.
make sure he's unconscious during the escape.
you're dropping this on me with three hours to go?
I don't know what to tell you.
3: 13 is when it starts.
we'll be on the beach by 3: 25.
in broad daylight.
the company still thinks we're doing this at 9: 00 tonight, right?
listen, I can't lie to these people anymore, Michael.
we need time to survey the transfer site, to figure out if we can get LJ and Sara out of there in case they try something.
you got the gun?
Yeah, I got the gun.
how's LJ? How's Sara?
they're fine.
what about the pictures?
I can't get pictures.
I need them, Linc.
I can't get the pictures.
how do we know they're still alive?
they're the only reason I'm doing this.
Susan says they're fine. Just trust her.
you're the one who's always telling me we can't trust anybody.
now you're...
you're vouching for this person?
there isn't enough time.
listen, if I don't see pictures of LJ and Sara by 2: 30 this afternoon,
I'm not going anywhere.
can't seem to find American cheese down here.
I hope you like Asadero.
Yeah. It's perfect.
a couple of years ago, I was serving in Mosul.
and I was taken prisoner.
a few nights later of U. S. army helicopters.
two clicks and closing.
my hands were still tied behind my back, and I...I ran.
it didn't occur to me that if this was a rescue mission, my captors could hear the choppers.
it didn't occur to me that this was actually a hostage exchange, and that my jumping would be viewed as a hostile act.
I got recaptured immediately.
six rangers died in the firefight.
and for the next three weeks...
let's just say men are pigs.
let's be clear.
this is an exchange.
if you don't try to be a hero, you and your father will be okay.
okay?
okay.
good.
eat.
Norman?
as you can imagine, he prefers Lechero.
he kill you before or after he does your taxes.
kill you when he pleases.
I'm feeling thirsty.
why don't you go fix us something to drink, boy?
maybe you ain't got the memorandum, but I've been promoted.
boy.
what did you say to me? Hmm?
what's the problem?
stumpy here and his mouth.
that's the problem.
I'm calling him out right now!
I'll talk to him.
leave.
this isn't over.
leave!
we was just, uh...
no, no, no.
the favor you owe me...
what have you found out?
a thing like this takes time.
I can't just walk up to them and say, "hey, whoever's been betraying Lechero, raise your hand." You know?
I asked you to be my ears in this prison, and you hear nothing?
all I know is every time I try and sit down and begin sussing things out, Sammy always changes the subject.
not that I'm saying he's the guy, but...
I don't want to hear your theories.
I want results.
is everything okay?
is James all right?
Yeah, he's fine.
where is this from?
Uribe's, the roadside bodega a few kilometers away.
if I needed you to id a specific guard
a tower guard-- could you do it?
I just don't want to get busted.
could you do it or not?
Yes.
Lincoln? - Yeah.
what is it? - I need something.
Teodoro's harmless, man.
he's a...He's a clown.
he's a dead clown.
Hey, man, I wasn't going to say anything, but, uh, last night, I was looking for my playing cards and guess what?
I found these.
you're holding out on me.
take 'em.
they taste nasty.
man, you cannot get a better cigar than this.
Where'd you get these?
I can't make him stop sending them in to me, but I don't work for him, you understand?
you sure you don't mind?
I was in the neighborhood.
you came all this way to visit?
I came to get you out of here.
I can have you in Schaum correctional facility in 48 hours.
in St. Louis.
Sullins wanted a medium security, but, uh, talked him down.
what sort of deal is he getting me?
25 years?
life?
the director's giving us a lot of latitude in exchange for testimony against the government in the lincoln burrows conspiracy.
so...
how does eight years sound?
soon as Sullins finishes up, we can have a van ready...
I don't think so.
what?
I appreciate the effort, your effort, but, um, I can't do eight years.
you're doing ten now.
the government is calling in some favors.
once you're in the U. S.
if you don't cooperate, they're going to charge you with everything.
that's multiple homicide counts.
without this deal, you are gonna be in prison for the rest of your life.
I appreciate the effort, your effort.
but I can't.
while we're getting out of here, and...
if I don't make it, will you make sure this gets to my girlfriend?
all right.
you know, uh...
I could do the same for you.
tie an anchor bend there.
I was just offering.
you know what, if I'm the one who doesn't make it, and you really want to do me a favor, just hold up your end of the bargain.
I'll do everything I can.
I hope that's true.
how's that knot coming?
there.
did I pass your test?
I told you I'm a fisherman.
where are we?
I found a cell that'll get us into no-man's-land.
it's a longer run to the fence than my old one, but it's gonna have to do.
which one? Who lives there?
Papo, Cheo and Sammy.
look, I know what you're thinking, but it's the only other cell on the second floor with a direct line to the fence, where we won't be seen the other tower guards.
and how do we guarantee that they won't be there?
by 2: 00, everyone should be out in the courtyard for the lunchtime soccer game.
you sure it hasn't started already?
someone went outside the ring to settle a dispute.
now, anyone who affronts our justice system in this way must be punished.
now, I know the coward won't come forward.
but if anyone has information about this shameful act, I demand to know.
let's go, Menudo. - Why?
Lechero wants you.
move your ass.
now, every day I see you out in the yard, you play your American sports and wear your American clothes.
I don't think I've heard you speak one word of Spanish since you've been here.
I like to practice my English.
and why shouldn't you?
america is a great nation.
one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
is that right?
Yes.
Yes.
justice for all.
justice for you and justice for me.
and justice for...whoever killed that blanquito in the yard.
now, I know why you didn't say anything out there.
but you play your silly American games all day long, right in front of the stairs where the body was found.
now, if you don't tell me what you saw, there will be consequences.
well, I-I saw one person go into the stairwell.
a-and then maybe a minute later, I heard an argument.
who did you see?
so after we tie the cord off...
we dig out the bar, we pop open the grate, and we're, and we're down, right, Michael?
does anyone want to say anything about what we just saw out there?
what is there to say?
well, for starters, an hour ago, you say maybe we should kill someone and then someone gets killed.
I didn't say that, and this is exactly what we should be focusing on right now.
let's spend a couple of hours worrying about another dead body in this hellhole.
what do you want?
what are you doing?
Lechero wants to see you.
I don't have any information.
he doesn't want information.
he wants a confession.
I didn't do anything.
listen to him; he's innocent.
you want to confess?
you can easily switch places.
maybe now we should start worrying about who the real killer is, huh?
Yeah, but in this place, there could be a hundred people on that list.
except I'm thinking a single stab wound to the base of the neck looks pretty professional, Alex.
I was in visitation, Kojak.
and what makes you so sure that Whistler didn't do it?
he's the one that had the run-in with the guy.
no, he's got too much to lose.
well, Whistler's gone, and if not now, he probably will be soon, so it's you and me.
there's no you and me.
we're not leaving here without him.
in two hours, I'm going out that window and through that fence.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, that's right.
and where are you going to go to, Alex?
anywhere but here.
there's only one road out, and the jungle is under constant patrol by police 24-7, so, again, where are you going to go to, Alex?
3: 13, I'm gone.
I told you I know nothing about this.
I shouldn't...
I shouldn't be here.
I can promise you I, I did not kill that man.
someone saw you go down the staircase.
stair...
is there any other proof?
my men will find something.
well, do you see a weapon on me?
I didn't expect to see a weapon on you.
well, w-why don't they look for that?
you find that, you'll find the real killer.
or maybe they find where you planted it.
so, what, I'm framing someone?
well, did it ever occur to you that someone might be framing me?
who would bother?
you know the reason I'm here.
you know I have powerful enemies.
you think my judgment is swayed by the mayor's friends?
sit your ass down.
when I was 13, my mother worked for a wealthy man as a maid until one day...
she was alone in the house...
with him and he...
everybody knew what he did, but because he was rich and we were immigrants, the police wouldn't even take a report.
so, a week later, to gain access through his gates,
I dressed as a milkman-- a Lechero
and I made sure that fair punishment was rendered.
now you want to tell me how I favor the rich.
I understand the rules here, and I respect them.
but why the rush to judgment?
is there a rule saying you must convict a suspect within ten minutes?
no.
we have all the time in the world.
thank you.
now, obviously, I'm not going anywhere.
if you need to talk again, I'm gonna be in my cell.
no.
you'll be right here in this chair.
what the hell do you want?
I don't like you.
I certainly don't respect you.
stop. You're hurting my feelings.
I've seen what you're capable of, but I got to say I never pegged you as a murderer.
you think I killed Tyge?
I saw the two of you in the courtyard this morning.
I was trying to be nice to him.
he started with me.
well, if you didn't kill him, who did?
not me.
come on, Brad.
who wanted him dead besides you?
you really think I killed that frog?
how many times have I had you at gunpoint?
you think I didn't want to pull that trigger?
hell...
I can't even kill myself.
Hey, you seen anyone see Whistler go down the stairway?
we only been out here a minute.
well, hurry up, then.
the sooner Whistler dies, the sooner I can give you the chicken foot, or if you prefer, you can give me the chicken foot.
you know, try and go out like a man.
either way, you're getting in the ring with me today.
it's used to anesthetize dogs.
two drops, and the guard should be out within an hour.
I was expecting Whistler's girlfriend to join you.
where is she? Around the corner in the car?
she came to me.
I don't mind that she's helping you.
I mind that you kept it from me.
what difference does it make?
I mean, we're done by tomorrow, right?
no more surprises, Lincoln.
what? Say it.
can you get any more pictures of Sara?
alive? No.
you didn't tell him.
you didn't tell Michael that Sara's dead.
can we get pictures or not?
I'm sure we can cobble something together, but smart move not telling your brother.
he seems a little sensitive to me.
this is the exchange point-- LJ and I will be waiting.
you, Michael and Whistler will meet us there.
everything goes as planned, you'll have your son back by 9: 00.
which one is it?
I don't know, I think it's the taller one.
the other one is always drinking orange juice.
you sure? - I think so,
I'm not completely sure, but they all look the same.
we there's
I was come on.
you ?
get juice.
please.
watch where you're going!
here, look, uh...
this is a buddy's, please. Please, I insist.
new coffee - No really. - Toma, Toma.
man, I...thank you anyway.
I need to go to Sona.
I...My car's run out of gas and
sorry. I'm-I'm heading in the wrong, wrong direction.
I really need to go to Sona.
thank you.
watch the lid.
my condolences.
you finally make a friend, and now he's about to die.
damn shame.
you can stop it, you know.
if you hadn't noticed, my position enables me to hear things.
I'm listening.
the only proof Lechero's got is that your man went down that staircase, right?
what if you had more compelling evidence?
well, I don't.
but if you did...
you're suggesting I make something up?
if it makes your conscience feel better, then blame it on somebody who deserves it.
someone who's killed before and gone unpunished.
Yeah, like you maybe.
you want me to tell Lechero that his right hand man should die?
you don't tell Lechero squat.
Lechero knows this is Sammy's ring.
if you drop it in the blood by the staircase, then yell up to Lechero what you've found...
the whole entire prison will hear clear-cut evidence of Sammy's guilt.
Lechero will have no choice but to comply.
this is Sona.
don't you worry your pretty little head about it.
all you have to do is drop the ring in the blood and say it was Sammy.
I'll take care of the rest.
you want to save your friend's life?
someone else has to die.
explain your disagreement with this Tyge man.
from what I just heard, he knew something about you?
he thought he knew something about me.
opportunity and a motive. That's not a good combination.
you must know there's discontent from many prisoners over how you run Sona.
now would not be a good time to insult me.
no. No, no, my point is this: You execute me, you get your swift justice and you may placate the masses.
but when they find out who really did it...
they will know you killed an innocent man.
you're still not answering my question.
what was your disagreement with tyge?
he was a nosy guy. He got into my business.
I'm sure he did the same with someone else, and that's what got him killed.
would you just admit that you had an argument?
this is prison.
if someone makes false cusations, I can't back down.
you must respect that.
look, I've answered every one of your questions.
I've acquitted myself the best that I can.
now what can I do to make you trust me?
I don't trust anybody today.
you you
I mean
what's?
I Sona.
and your love.
could in this car.
Yeah. - We have the picture.
how does it look?
it looks like Sara.
I'll be at Sona in half an hour.
meet me in the parking lot.
is everything okay?
hold on, hold on, hold on.
don't man?
I but
Norman - Norman? Norman St. John? - Yes!
you girls? - Yes!
I'm waiting.
there was a complication with the guard.
complications drugging the guard?
Yeah, but it's been taken care of.
well, that's encouraging, but why are you drugging the guard now when you're escaping tonight?
well, it takes that long for the drugs to work...
they take an hour, like I told you.
you are getting sloppy, Alex.
what are you talking about?
is this is a joke?
I stopped hiding things under my mattress a long time ago.
did you find that under my mattress?'Cause if you did somebody put it there.
you're gonna have to do better than that.
Really? Did you find some fingerprints on it? Huh?
did you get some fibers?
what are you gonna do take it to the Sona crime lab?
they got Whistler nailed for walking into the wrong stairwell.
I'm thinking this is enough to get you guys to switch places.
you know what I mean?
what does that mean, huh? What does that prove?
it proves everything!
I'm gonna make sure Lechero thinks so, too.
Michael, I did not kill that man.
I did not kill the man.
what's, what's going on?
is everything okay?
what the hell you doing? Huh?
what's that for?
your father tried to be a hero.
no, no.
Hey, please, please.
please, no, stop!
once I cut the spinal cord and the sever nerve endings, you won't feel a thing.
no, no...
Susan, I'm sorry.
we didn't mean to do that.
dad, they're gonna kill me.
what? LJ?
Yeah, they got a knife to my throat.
Susan, don't you hurt- - Dad...
the truth. - Truth.
Michael's getting out at 3: 13.
we're meeting at the exchange point at 3: 45.
Susan, please, we did this because we wanted to make sure the site was safe.
that's it, that's the only reason why we did it.
sounds to me like you're planning another end round. Another rescue.
no, no. We're not, we're not planning, we're not planning another end round.
no. Please, just...let my son go.
leave my son.
Wow. Living the good life, huh?
is that what this is?
having too good a time here to contemplate leaving?
I needed some time to think.
well, I needed some time to finalize our agreement with the Panamanians, but instead I get dragged down here.
Yeah, I'm sure it was really hard to convince you to come down here.
I'm gonna be honest.
I was looking forward to seeing you down here like this, but now that I'm here, I, uh, wouldn't wish this on anyone.
can we just save all this till after...
I don't know if we can or not. Made up your mind yet, Alex?
eight years, minimum security.
I got 'em down to four.
and I leave for the U.S. tonight?
once the special prosecutor clears you, you'll be on your way.
what about a special prosecutor?
you stand in front of a guy, you, you tell your story and he determines if you're gonna be a useful and credible witness.
it's a formality.
it's a formality"?
this is just a formality?
you know, if it were up to me, you could rot in here for the rest of your life.
but the justice department is extremely motivated to get to the bottom of this president Reynolds business.
Alex, this is a hundred percent abovboard.
you've made a lot of mistakes in your career.
you know it and I know it, intentional or otherwise.
I've got eight files in my office attesting to that.
and if you don't take this offer, then I assure you it would be the biggest mistake of your life.
I know who killed that man.
I'm sure you do. Lechero!
what do we have here?
I found this in Alexander Mahone's cell.
convenient!
to blame this on a man who can't even be questioned.
enough of this already. Cheo!
get the prisoner up.
it's time.
you know Whistler didn't do this.
he just said he found the shank in Mahone's cell?
doesn't that prove I'm innont?
yore a joke!
you talk about equality.
you talk justice, but at the end of the day you're a dictator, and just like any dictator you're terrified of losing your power.
it'd be very unwise to go any further.
you don't care who the real killer is just as long as you get to string somebody up.
that's all that matters to you, isn't it?
I've determined who's guilty, and the punishment is death.
you're making a mistake.
this is murder!
you know it and I know it!
at least have the guts to admit it!
you're right!
it's murder.
don't!
I found this in the yard.
augusto used to give them to me as tribute.
and now you reek of them.
go.
okay?
it's sad...
one of you.
he will be okay.
I question your love for your son.
he was two seconds away from being decapitated because of you.
I told you the truth.
maybe.
but if you have anything else planned, now it's scrapped.
because, what happens if you try something?
I know. - Oh, good.
this is the same newspaper she was holding in the last picture.
that's what my guy could get.
you didn't give me a lot of time.
you think Michael's not going to notice this?
Yeah.
Hey, Michael, here's the pictures.
he's going to want to see this close up.
I'm done doing favors for you.
get out. I'll see you in an hour.
no football today?
no, no football today.
you're my brother, Sammy?
of course.
Michael: It's done?
the guard will be asleep in a half hour.
so we're good.
not quite.
they, uh, they know we're breaking out this afternoon.
you told her?
= Man, she worked it out... - why didn't you lie?
she worked it out.
so what are we gonna do to get the upper hand here, Linc?
nothing. - You think they're just going to turn over LJ and Sara?
this is too dangerous.
if we try anything, they're just going to...
what, hurt them?
no, not if they want us to deliver on whistler, they won't.
we're playing this one straight. No games. No surprises.
all right?
show me the pictures.
show me the pictures, Linc.
come on...the pictures.
I can't show you the pictures, man.
why not, Linc?
she's dead, Michael.
I lied to you.
I'm sorry.
if you don't break out today, they're going to kill my son.
they're going to kill LJ.
Michael, we've got to do this.
Michael, we've got to do this!
Sara's dead. They killed her.
Oh, man, I'm so sorry.
I loved her and...
now she's gone.
and it's all because of you.
what?
Hey, take it easy.
Wh...what?
this is your fault.
he's told me his grievance.
this fight is going to happen.
just think about what you're doing.
I have.
did you ask for a recent photo of LJ and Sara?
Yeah.
where is it?
she showed me the pictures, but she wouldn't let me keep them.
all right.
I want to know who this guy is.
said his name was Sullins.
Alex, thanks for coming in.
Hello, Lang.
what's going on?
there's all kinds of suits over here going through your office.
I know you, huh? - Afraid not.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
you're Mcfadden.
you've confused me with someone else.
you were with the ambassador.
you don't know me, I don't know you, but it's your job to get me out of here.
you break out tomorrow. By 3: 00 P. M.
you mean A. M. - No, I mean P. M.
we're doing this tomorrow...in the middle of the day.
the ring.
wise decision.
want the ring, brother?
that's more your style, man.
Hey, hey, hey. It's all right, it's all right.
you all go on back.
go ahead.
no, go ahead.
a word.
you should try and be more careful in the future.
Yes, sir.
Hey.
Hey.
what's your name?
the Australian.
you said you knew him from Nice.
is that true?
you calling me a liar now?
he says you're full of it.
he said he was never an ambassador.
no, not an ambassador, the ambassador.
I was concierge at the ambassador hotel.
I could've sworn he worked there for a few months.
who the hell knows, huh?
I was high half the time.
kind of why I got fired.
kind of why I'm in here.
what was he up to in Nice?
what?
you writing a book?
we're leaving at 3: 13-- that gives us three hours 41 minutes.
and we still don't have a way into no-man's-land.
I'll take care of that.
I just need to check it out first.
and the fence?
your grave digger friends only sprayed the thing once, and I'd just as soon not get electrocuted today.
would I feel better if Sucre had sprayed the fence again? Yes.
is that an option? No.
unless he had another reason to be there.
what are you going to do?
kill someone to get more spray on the fence?
I'd think about killing you if it helped us get out of here today.
you know what'll help us get out of here?
a ladder.
where are we gonna go once we get through that fence?
just get me a ladder.
this hammock's shorter than the last one.
well, we might need something to extend it.
all right, I'll take care of it.
I've never been to Nice.
I hear it's beautiful.
I wouldn't know.
I don't care if this guy knows you or not.
but what I do care about is his apparent fixation with watching you at all times.
we'll be out of here soon enough.
he won't be a problem.
Hey, buddy, check it out.
do they roll bones in your country?
come to my cell, I'll teach you.
U want me to come back to your cell and roll bones？Real subtle.
hardy har-har.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's hilarious.
tell me, are you this friendly with all the shirtless guys in Sona?
I gave you food yesterday.
I gave you a place to sleep.
I wonder why.
what the hell is your problem?
look, I just don't want to have sex with you, okay?
is that so hard to believe?
get a plate.
to make it across no-man's-land, we're going to have to disable two of the tower guards.
I've already taken care of one of them.
with the other one, we're going to need your help.
every day between 1: 00 and 2: 00, he takes his lunch break.
he gets a cup of coffee.
you need to find out where and put something in that cup.
make sure he's unconscious during the escape.
you're dropping this on me with three hours to go?
I don't know what to tell you.
3: 13 is when it starts.
we'll be on the beach by 3: 25.
in broad daylight.
the company still thinks we're doing this at 9: 00 tonight, right?
listen, I can't lie to these people anymore, Michael.
we need time to survey the transfer site, to figure out if we can get LJ and Sara out of there in case they try something.
you got the gun?
Yeah, I got the gun.
how's LJ? How's Sara?
they're fine.
what about the pictures?
I can't get pictures.
I need them, Linc.
I can't get the pictures.
how do we know they're still alive?
they're the only reason I'm doing this.
Susan says they're fine. Just trust her.
you're the one who's always telling me we can't trust anybody.
now you're...
you're vouching for this person?
there isn't enough time.
listen, if I don't see pictures of LJ and Sara by 2: 30 this afternoon,
I'm not going anywhere.
can't seem to find American cheese down here.
I hope you like Asadero.
Yeah. It's perfect.
a couple of years ago, I was serving in Mosul.
and I was taken prisoner.
a few nights later of U. S. army helicopters.
two clicks and closing.
my hands were still tied behind my back, and I...I ran.
it didn't occur to me that if this was a rescue mission, my captors could hear the choppers.
it didn't occur to me that this was actually a hostage exchange, and that my jumping would be viewed as a hostile act.
I got recaptured immediately.
six rangers died in the firefight.
and for the next three weeks...
let's just say men are pigs.
let's be clear.
this is an exchange.
if you don't try to be a hero, you and your father will be okay.
okay?
okay.
good.
eat.
Norman?
as you can imagine, he prefers Lechero.
he kill you before or after he does your taxes.
kill you when he pleases.
I'm feeling thirsty.
why don't you go fix us something to drink, boy?
maybe you ain't got the memorandum, but I've been promoted.
boy.
what did you say to me? Hmm?
what's the problem?
stumpy here and his mouth.
that's the problem.
I'm calling him out right now!
I'll talk to him.
leave.
this isn't over.
leave!
we was just, uh...
no, no, no.
the favor you owe me...
what have you found out?
a thing like this takes time.
I can't just walk up to them and say, "hey, whoever's been betraying Lechero, raise your hand." You know?
I asked you to be my ears in this prison, and you hear nothing?
all I know is every time I try and sit down and begin sussing things out, Sammy always changes the subject.
not that I'm saying he's the guy, but...
I don't want to hear your theories.
I want results.
is everything okay?
is James all right?
Yeah, he's fine.
where is this from?
Uribe's, the roadside bodega a few kilometers away.
if I needed you to id a specific guard
a tower guard-- could you do it?
I just don't want to get busted.
could you do it or not?
Yes.
Lincoln? - Yeah.
what is it? - I need something.
Teodoro's harmless, man.
he's a...He's a clown.
he's a dead clown.
Hey, man, I wasn't going to say anything, but, uh, last night, I was looking for my playing cards and guess what?
I found these.
you're holding out on me.
take 'em.
they taste nasty.
man, you cannot get a better cigar than this.
Where'd you get these?
I can't make him stop sending them in to me, but I don't work for him, you understand?
you sure you don't mind?
I was in the neighborhood.
you came all this way to visit?
I came to get you out of here.
I can have you in Schaum correctional facility in 48 hours.
in St. Louis.
Sullins wanted a medium security, but, uh, talked him down.
what sort of deal is he getting me?
25 years?
life?
the director's giving us a lot of latitude in exchange for testimony against the government in the lincoln burrows conspiracy.
so...
how does eight years sound?
soon as Sullins finishes up, we can have a van ready...
I don't think so.
what?
I appreciate the effort, your effort, but, um, I can't do eight years.
you're doing ten now.
the government is calling in some favors.
once you're in the U. S.
if you don't cooperate, they're going to charge you with everything.
that's multiple homicide counts.
without this deal, you are gonna be in prison for the rest of your life.
I appreciate the effort, your effort.
but I can't.
while we're getting out of here, and...
if I don't make it, will you make sure this gets to my girlfriend?
all right.
you know, uh...
I could do the same for you.
tie an anchor bend there.
I was just offering.
you know what, if I'm the one who doesn't make it, and you really want to do me a favor, just hold up your end of the bargain.
I'll do everything I can.
I hope that's true.
how's that knot coming?
there.
did I pass your test?
I told you I'm a fisherman.
where are we?
I found a cell that'll get us into no-man's-land.
it's a longer run to the fence than my old one, but it's gonna have to do.
which one? Who lives there?
Papo, Cheo and Sammy.
look, I know what you're thinking, but it's the only other cell on the second floor with a direct line to the fence, where we won't be seen the other tower guards.
and how do we guarantee that they won't be there?
by 2: 00, everyone should be out in the courtyard for the lunchtime soccer game.
you sure it hasn't started already?
someone went outside the ring to settle a dispute.
now, anyone who affronts our justice system in this way must be punished.
now, I know the coward won't come forward.
but if anyone has information about this shameful act, I demand to know.
let's go, Menudo. - Why?
Lechero wants you.
move your ass.
now, every day I see you out in the yard, you play your American sports and wear your American clothes.
I don't think I've heard you speak one word of Spanish since you've been here.
I like to practice my English.
and why shouldn't you?
america is a great nation.
one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
is that right?
Yes.
Yes.
justice for all.
justice for you and justice for me.
and justice for...whoever killed that blanquito in the yard.
now, I know why you didn't say anything out there.
but you play your silly American games all day long, right in front of the stairs where the body was found.
now, if you don't tell me what you saw, there will be consequences.
well, I-I saw one person go into the stairwell.
a-and then maybe a minute later, I heard an argument.
who did you see?
so after we tie the cord off...
we dig out the bar, we pop open the grate, and we're, and we're down, right, Michael?
does anyone want to say anything about what we just saw out there?
what is there to say?
well, for starters, an hour ago, you say maybe we should kill someone and then someone gets killed.
I didn't say that, and this is exactly what we should be focusing on right now.
let's spend a couple of hours worrying about another dead body in this hellhole.
what do you want?
what are you doing?
Lechero wants to see you.
I don't have any information.
he doesn't want information.
he wants a confession.
I didn't do anything.
listen to him; he's innocent.
you want to confess?
you can easily switch places.
maybe now we should start worrying about who the real killer is, huh?
Yeah, but in this place, there could be a hundred people on that list.
except I'm thinking a single stab wound to the base of the neck looks pretty professional, Alex.
I was in visitation, Kojak.
and what makes you so sure that Whistler didn't do it?
he's the one that had the run-in with the guy.
no, he's got too much to lose.
well, Whistler's gone, and if not now, he probably will be soon, so it's you and me.
there's no you and me.
we're not leaving here without him.
in two hours, I'm going out that window and through that fence.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, that's right.
and where are you going to go to, Alex?
anywhere but here.
there's only one road out, and the jungle is under constant patrol by police 24-7, so, again, where are you going to go to, Alex?
3: 13, I'm gone.
I told you I know nothing about this.
I shouldn't...
I shouldn't be here.
I can promise you I, I did not kill that man.
someone saw you go down the staircase.
stair...
is there any other proof?
my men will find something.
well, do you see a weapon on me?
I didn't expect to see a weapon on you.
well, w-why don't they look for that?
you find that, you'll find the real killer.
or maybe they find where you planted it.
so, what, I'm framing someone?
well, did it ever occur to you that someone might be framing me?
who would bother?
you know the reason I'm here.
you know I have powerful enemies.
you think my judgment is swayed by the mayor's friends?
sit your ass down.
when I was 13, my mother worked for a wealthy man as a maid until one day...
she was alone in the house...
with him and he...
everybody knew what he did, but because he was rich and we were immigrants, the police wouldn't even take a report.
so, a week later, to gain access through his gates,
I dressed as a milkman-- a Lechero
and I made sure that fair punishment was rendered.
now you want to tell me how I favor the rich.
I understand the rules here, and I respect them.
but why the rush to judgment?
is there a rule saying you must convict a suspect within ten minutes?
no.
we have all the time in the world.
thank you.
now, obviously, I'm not going anywhere.
if you need to talk again, I'm gonna be in my cell.
no.
you'll be right here in this chair.
what the hell do you want?
I don't like you.
I certainly don't respect you.
stop. You're hurting my feelings.
I've seen what you're capable of, but I got to say I never pegged you as a murderer.
you think I killed Tyge?
I saw the two of you in the courtyard this morning.
I was trying to be nice to him.
he started with me.
well, if you didn't kill him, who did?
not me.
come on, Brad.
who wanted him dead besides you?
you really think I killed that frog?
how many times have I had you at gunpoint?
you think I didn't want to pull that trigger?
hell...
I can't even kill myself.
Hey, you seen anyone see Whistler go down the stairway?
we only been out here a minute.
well, hurry up, then.
the sooner Whistler dies, the sooner I can give you the chicken foot, or if you prefer, you can give me the chicken foot.
you know, try and go out like a man.
either way, you're getting in the ring with me today.
it's used to anesthetize dogs.
two drops, and the guard should be out within an hour.
I was expecting Whistler's girlfriend to join you.
where is she? Around the corner in the car?
she came to me.
I don't mind that she's helping you.
I mind that you kept it from me.
what difference does it make?
I mean, we're done by tomorrow, right?
no more surprises, Lincoln.
what? Say it.
can you get any more pictures of Sara?
alive? No.
you didn't tell him.
you didn't tell Michael that Sara's dead.
can we get pictures or not?
I'm sure we can cobble something together, but smart move not telling your brother.
he seems a little sensitive to me.
this is the exchange point-- LJ and I will be waiting.
you, Michael and Whistler will meet us there.
everything goes as planned, you'll have your son back by 9: 00.
which one is it?
I don't know, I think it's the taller one.
the other one is always drinking orange juice.
you sure? - I think so,
I'm not completely sure, but they all look the same.
we there's
I was come on.
you ?
get juice.
please.
watch where you're going!
here, look, uh...
this is a buddy's, please. Please, I insist.
new coffee - No really. - Toma, Toma.
man, I...thank you anyway.
I need to go to Sona.
I...My car's run out of gas and
sorry. I'm-I'm heading in the wrong, wrong direction.
I really need to go to Sona.
thank you.
watch the lid.
my condolences.
you finally make a friend, and now he's about to die.
damn shame.
you can stop it, you know.
if you hadn't noticed, my position enables me to hear things.
I'm listening.
the only proof Lechero's got is that your man went down that staircase, right?
what if you had more compelling evidence?
well, I don't.
but if you did...
you're suggesting I make something up?
if it makes your conscience feel better, then blame it on somebody who deserves it.
someone who's killed before and gone unpunished.
Yeah, like you maybe.
you want me to tell Lechero that his right hand man should die?
you don't tell Lechero squat.
Lechero knows this is Sammy's ring.
if you drop it in the blood by the staircase, then yell up to Lechero what you've found...
the whole entire prison will hear clear-cut evidence of Sammy's guilt.
Lechero will have no choice but to comply.
this is Sona.
don't you worry your pretty little head about it.
all you have to do is drop the ring in the blood and say it was Sammy.
I'll take care of the rest.
you want to save your friend's life?
someone else has to die.
explain your disagreement with this Tyge man.
from what I just heard, he knew something about you?
he thought he knew something about me.
opportunity and a motive. That's not a good combination.
you must know there's discontent from many prisoners over how you run Sona.
now would not be a good time to insult me.
no. No, no, my point is this: You execute me, you get your swift justice and you may placate the masses.
but when they find out who really did it...
they will know you killed an innocent man.
you're still not answering my question.
what was your disagreement with tyge?
he was a nosy guy. He got into my business.
I'm sure he did the same with someone else, and that's what got him killed.
would you just admit that you had an argument?
this is prison.
if someone makes false cusations, I can't back down.
you must respect that.
look, I've answered every one of your questions.
I've acquitted myself the best that I can.
now what can I do to make you trust me?
I don't trust anybody today.
you you
I mean
what's?
I Sona.
and your love.
could in this car.
Yeah. - We have the picture.
how does it look?
it looks like Sara.
I'll be at Sona in half an hour.
meet me in the parking lot.
is everything okay?
hold on, hold on, hold on.
don't man?
I but
Norman - Norman? Norman St. John? - Yes!
you girls? - Yes!
I'm waiting.
there was a complication with the guard.
complications drugging the guard?
Yeah, but it's been taken care of.
well, that's encouraging, but why are you drugging the guard now when you're escaping tonight?
well, it takes that long for the drugs to work...
they take an hour, like I told you.
you are getting sloppy, Alex.
what are you talking about?
is this is a joke?
I stopped hiding things under my mattress a long time ago.
did you find that under my mattress?'Cause if you did somebody put it there.
you're gonna have to do better than that.
Really? Did you find some fingerprints on it? Huh?
did you get some fibers?
what are you gonna do take it to the Sona crime lab?
they got Whistler nailed for walking into the wrong stairwell.
I'm thinking this is enough to get you guys to switch places.
you know what I mean?
what does that mean, huh? What does that prove?
it proves everything!
I'm gonna make sure Lechero thinks so, too.
Michael, I did not kill that man.
I did not kill the man.
what's, what's going on?
is everything okay?
what the hell you doing? Huh?
what's that for?
your father tried to be a hero.
no, no.
Hey, please, please.
please, no, stop!
once I cut the spinal cord and the sever nerve endings, you won't feel a thing.
no, no...
Susan, I'm sorry.
we didn't mean to do that.
dad, they're gonna kill me.
what? LJ?
Yeah, they got a knife to my throat.
Susan, don't you hurt- - Dad...
the truth. - Truth.
Michael's getting out at 3: 13.
we're meeting at the exchange point at 3: 45.
Susan, please, we did this because we wanted to make sure the site was safe.
that's it, that's the only reason why we did it.
sounds to me like you're planning another end round. Another rescue.
no, no. We're not, we're not planning, we're not planning another end round.
no. Please, just...let my son go.
leave my son.
Wow. Living the good life, huh?
is that what this is?
having too good a time here to contemplate leaving?
I needed some time to think.
well, I needed some time to finalize our agreement with the Panamanians, but instead I get dragged down here.
Yeah, I'm sure it was really hard to convince you to come down here.
I'm gonna be honest.
I was looking forward to seeing you down here like this, but now that I'm here, I, uh, wouldn't wish this on anyone.
can we just save all this till after...
I don't know if we can or not. Made up your mind yet, Alex?
eight years, minimum security.
I got 'em down to four.
and I leave for the U.S. tonight?
once the special prosecutor clears you, you'll be on your way.
what about a special prosecutor?
you stand in front of a guy, you, you tell your story and he determines if you're gonna be a useful and credible witness.
it's a formality.
it's a formality"?
this is just a formality?
you know, if it were up to me, you could rot in here for the rest of your life.
but the justice department is extremely motivated to get to the bottom of this president Reynolds business.
Alex, this is a hundred percent abovboard.
you've made a lot of mistakes in your career.
you know it and I know it, intentional or otherwise.
I've got eight files in my office attesting to that.
and if you don't take this offer, then I assure you it would be the biggest mistake of your life.
I know who killed that man.
I'm sure you do. Lechero!
what do we have here?
I found this in Alexander Mahone's cell.
convenient!
to blame this on a man who can't even be questioned.
enough of this already. Cheo!
get the prisoner up.
it's time.
you know Whistler didn't do this.
he just said he found the shank in Mahone's cell?
doesn't that prove I'm innont?
yore a joke!
you talk about equality.
you talk justice, but at the end of the day you're a dictator, and just like any dictator you're terrified of losing your power.
it'd be very unwise to go any further.
you don't care who the real killer is just as long as you get to string somebody up.
that's all that matters to you, isn't it?
I've determined who's guilty, and the punishment is death.
you're making a mistake.
this is murder!
you know it and I know it!
at least have the guts to admit it!
you're right!
it's murder.
don't!
I found this in the yard.
augusto used to give them to me as tribute.
and now you reek of them.
go.
okay?
it's sad...
one of you.
he will be okay.
I question your love for your son.
he was two seconds away from being decapitated because of you.
I told you the truth.
maybe.
but if you have anything else planned, now it's scrapped.
because, what happens if you try something?
I know. - Oh, good.
this is the same newspaper she was holding in the last picture.
that's what my guy could get.
you didn't give me a lot of time.
you think Michael's not going to notice this?
Yeah.
Hey, Michael, here's the pictures.
he's going to want to see this close up.
I'm done doing favors for you.
get out. I'll see you in an hour.
no football today?
no, no football today.
you're my brother, Sammy?
of course.
Michael: It's done?
the guard will be asleep in a half hour.
so we're good.
not quite.
they, uh, they know we're breaking out this afternoon.
you told her?
= Man, she worked it out... - why didn't you lie?
she worked it out.
so what are we gonna do to get the upper hand here, Linc?
nothing. - You think they're just going to turn over LJ and Sara?
this is too dangerous.
if we try anything, they're just going to...
what, hurt them?
no, not if they want us to deliver on whistler, they won't.
we're playing this one straight. No games. No surprises.
all right?
show me the pictures.
show me the pictures, Linc.
come on...the pictures.
I can't show you the pictures, man.
why not, Linc?
she's dead, Michael.
I lied to you.
I'm sorry.
if you don't break out today, they're going to kill my son.
they're going to kill LJ.
Michael, we've got to do this.
Michael, we've got to do this!
Sara's dead. They killed her.
Oh, man, I'm so sorry.
I loved her and...
now she's gone.
and it's all because of you.
what?
Hey, take it easy.
Wh...what?
this is your fault.
he's told me his grievance.
this fight is going to happen.
just think about what you're doing.
I have.
we're losing the light!
go back!
you.
is it your cell?
you are breaking out of this prison, Mr. Scofield.
and you're taking me with you.
so with this deal what specifically are they expecting from me?
they need to know everything.
they want to confirm that you have viable, incriminating information and that you can be a cooperative witness.
show me the pictures.
I can't show you the pictures, man.
she's dead, Michael.
I thought we agreed it was best for you to not come here.
I need to know how this delay is going to affect things.
four more days.
if I'm out of here by then, I can still do it.
I'll let the brothers know.
you like this?
Yeah.
it's a special occasion.
my dad's coming today, so I'm just gonna wait here till he shows up.
you look sharp. - Thanks.
Scofield. You have a visitor LJ. Is he...
alive.
giving us four more days.
okay, good.
listen, back at the exchange point, I saw three body bags.
you, me and LJ, we weren't getting out of there alive.
that's the last time I get caught flatfooted.
then do what you got to do, Linc.
as long as I take care of my end, right?
Michael, I know you're angry with me about Sara, but...
you lied.
I had to lie.
your son is my nephew, and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.
but apparently...
apparently you only think I only care about myself.
I know you don't care about yourself, but you cared about Sara.
you loved her.
and I'm sorry.
but LJ's my son.
I-I couldn't let anything happen to him.
you know that.
you used me, Linc.
so I guess you and the company have something in common.
I don't know where he is.
I have tried every number I have.
well, listen, say.
never mind.
I found him.
Carter blue label.
you always had such high-end taste for a girl from wheeling.
since I paid for I.
you know how much I hate to travel, Gretchen...
but considering the mess down here, I made an exception.
it was a mess before I got here.
and it's time to clean it up.
we're ending this today.
bang and burn.
general, that was analyzed.
what you're asking for is too dangerous, not to mention next to impossible with the given time frame.
I remember a substantial wire transfer to an offshore account that took the word "impossible" out of the equation.
or tell me, did I hire the wrong person?
I am doing my job when I tell you to seriously reconsider.
and now, I have to do my job.
I don't pay you to be my advisor.
you're my operative.
you have your instructions, now get it done.
because if you don't,
I'll make what happened to you in Mosul feel like a massage.
this was a big mistake, Gretchen.
you can't make a habit of coming to Sona.
I won't.
because we're going with the bang and burn.
that's suicide.
we have more time.
my boss wants things to move a bit faster.
well, tell him you can't pull it off.
I might get killed if we do this.
and I might get killed if we don't.
between you and me, who do you think I care about more?
look at me, James.
see if you can tell how serious I am.
if you don't play ball, I will leave you in Sona to rot.
I promise.
be ready by 5: 00.
that's when it happens.
everybody goes.
what about scofield?
kill him.
you know the consequences if I'm seen talking to you?
the military's reinforcing the bars on all the windows.
can you talk to the colonel, get him to postpone that for a few days?
no.
after your performance yesterday, I have no further sway with the colonel.
well, then I'm afraid you've brokered your way into an escape plan that no longer exists.
I have an idea.
wait to hear from me.
what?
some of the men don't feel the need to pay their debts anymore.
it's been one week, man, and we lost three men.
now, if we gonna keep Sona, we're gonna need numbers.
I don't trust nobody here right now, especially now.
I work with the men I have.
really, brother?
you, me and the gimp over there, we gonna run this place?
I want to bring on Cristobal.
he's solid, man.
one of them Darrien ghetto boys.
bring him up.
but I promise you nothing.
find me anything that can sustain heavy rpgs and small arms.
a cougar, a stryker.
not gonna happen.
I do have a call in to a sergeant York, but...
Yeah, that's not going to cut it.
call Suezamel, put him on standby, tell him we might need him.
is there a problem?
we're doing this at 5: 00?
well, we could wait until tonight when our guys are moving too fast for our night vision to work properly.
you could even tag along if you want.
get it done.
Yes, I'm trying to locate the family of Mr. James Whistler.
I-I am his-- I'm his wife.
who's calling?
my name is Yommy Day.
I own the apartment building Mr. Whistler rents from.
there's been a busted pipe in his unit that's caused some damage to the apartment next door.
I'm sorry.
I think you have confused James with someone else.
he's not renting another apartment.
Oh, I assure you Mr. Whistler is my tenant.
I couldn't find anyone to contact after his conviction, but when the mail came, I checked his phone bill.
there were numerous calls to this number.
if you could please come to the apartment, the address is 40 Abel Bravo in Obarrio, unit 4.
tell your men the intel says the Panamanians have no access to Sam.
Yeah.
there's been a development.
mahone special ops company? deugs? family?
Hey.
the company's giving us four more days.
okay.
problem is I, uh, I don't know how we're getting out of here.
Lechero might have some ideas, but I'm still waiting to hear from him.
I'm sorry, is this a bad time for you?
it's been an intense 24 hours.
I have things on my mind.
Yeah, like your last trip to visitation maybe.
what, you're a spy now?
forgive me if I'm wrong, but she didn't really strike me as the girlfriend type.
she was company.
after your failed escape, she came to remind me that I have a stake in this, too, which you seem to have forgotten.
so forgive me if I don't jump for joy when you say you're working on a plan that may very well fail again.
I've got to get out of here, and it's getting to the point where I don't care how.
got what we talked about?
you never met me.
Oh, my god.
what the hell is going on?
what about Oscar Shales?
he...
raped, killed, tortured.
I couldn't turn, turn him over to some scumbag lawyer who was just gonna get him off or...or...
no, no, I just...
so I killed him.
and I felt...
good.
I felt, I felt really good.
but then, you know, came the visions of Shales begging for his life, and I couldn't get rid of them, so I, I got these drugs that kept me on an even keel.
and then when I got to Sona, I couldn't get my pills, so I had to...
improvise.
did you want me to get drugs for you?
I assume that whoever set this up must think that I might have some value.
it's why you came back for me.
I came here to help a man that I respect and care about.
and I appreciate that.
but I can't testify like this.
please...
please.
one inch of reinforced steel on every window.
nothing would get through those.
I'll figure someing out.
I know you will.
listen, man, I'm sorry about before.
like I said, things have been intense.
so much depends on this working out.
my nephew's life depends on this working.
I know it does.
I never asked-- how old is he?
sixteen.
Oh, hell.
knock knocka.
what do you want?
me? I just came by to slip something into your mail slot.
it's from el patron himself, but it was made for your eyes only.
grabby.
that don't look like no invitation to the Sona-Hawkins dance.
what do you got cooking up with Lechero, huh?
it's none of your business, Theodore.
you want to keep secrets?
you want to treat me like a pesky insect? Fine.
just remember, information, like crumbs, always trickles down to the vermin on the floor.
4: 00?
it's a sketch of Lechero's quarters.
to be honest, when a tenant pays a year's rent in advance and then gets locked up,
I normally rent the place out and double my money, but, uh, James was a good man.
I was hoping things would turn out well for him.
look, uh, miss...
a lot of guys have a little something on the side.
this apartment, I mean, whoever he brought here, doesn't mean he didn't love ya.
you said you have James' insunce paper?
right on. Right on.
I'll, uh, I'll go get them.
Oh, god.
there's another door in here.
4413, huh?
what about scofield?
kill him.
you know, if Lechero didn't send this, t-bag might be setting me up for someone.
I say we get out of here.
I'm truly sorry you got caught up in my troubles, Michael.
I take it there's another code.
I'm the only one that knows it.
for a man who likes keeping a secret, choosing t-bag as a go-between might not be the smartest move.
Yeah, by the time he figures it out, we'll be long gone.
Sammy's on his way back.
let's go.
what the hell's this?
underground tunnel.
the old administration used it to travel between cellblocks a and B.
after the riots, they moved us all to B.
and then the soldiers came in, blew this tunnel up.
oks like someone already tried to get through the debris.
I never planned to spend my whole life in Sona.
just didn't expect it to end so soon.
you're the engineer, though, right?
you can dig our way out of this?
Yeah, me and a couple of payloaders.
now, you listen.
you're gonna dig out of this ace.
we're not digging out, but we might be diggin up.
Hello, Sofia.
hello.
who are you?
friend of James.
old friend.
well, he isn't here.
I know where he is.
I can see why James loves you.
you are beautiful.
if you keep sticking your nose where it doesn't belong,
I'm gonna make him miss you very, very much.
do you understand what I'm saying to you?
good.
you don't need to worry about this.
now listen very carefully to me, Sofia, and you won't get hurt.
I want you to go home and do your hair and paint your nails and get all ready for when James comes home.
you two will live happily ever after.
what do you want from him?
see? You're not listening already.
t get in the way, or I promise you things will get very bad for you.
you are truly beautiful.
I hope you can stay that way.
get the hell out of here.
all right, if we can get through the ceiling, the foundation and the earth on top of that, we can make it out into the middle of no-man's-land and maybe hit the fence before we get shot.
Yeah.
well, we wouldn't want that.
Yes, but you can dig out, though, right?
based on gravity and the kind of sand that Sona's built on, we're gonna need some kind of support brace for the tunnel.
or...
or what?
the whole thing collapses and we're buried alive.
go on and relax, huh?
I'll get some rum.
how long will this take?
maybe two days.
I got to get upstairs, estimate exactly where in no-man's land that tunnel's gonna let out.
where you going?
I'm meditating.
just getting rum for Cristobal and his boys.
rum? His boys?
no, I said I'd meet with cristobal, not every half-breed in Sona.
well, they up there right now.
so, let's go.
let me just get some rum, now.
no, man.
them drink beer like everyone else.
look, man, offer them something good.
don't make me look the fool.
the rum is for me, Sammy.
no?
you have a problem with that?
no, sir.
let's go.
let's get back to work.
Hey, only Lechero has the code.
we don't need a code.
now, get inside before Sammy comes back.
Where's agent Lang?
agent... - I don't know.
but what the hell's wrong with you?
what's going on?
I have a right to be nervous.
my life is on the line, you know?
what are you talking about?
you have given live press conferences your entire life.
I've see you many times.
you're an old pro.
now, splash some water on your face.
the panel wants us there right now, immediately.
what?
get dressed.
or would you rather have me drag your ass back to sona?
water on the face.
get your suit on.
we're going.
Yeah, it's Sullins.
uh, we're almost ready to move here.
where the hell is Lang?
no.
where are we at?
everything's in place.
good.
we've done our part.
now it's time for Whistler to step up and do his.
come 5: 00, he better be ready.
three feet of concrete and rebar, plus ten feet of dirt and sand, before we see sky.
are you all right?
to be completely honest...
no, not really.
I have this thing for, uh, confined spaces.
are you telling me you're claustrophobic?
ever since I was A...boy.
um, you know, I need to be upstairs.
that's not really an option right now.
well, staying here is not really an option for me, either.
I suggest you get yourself together.
I just need some air.
what the hell's the matter with you?
I need to get out of here; I need air.
Hey, you walk through that door with Sammy on the other side, you'll never need air again.
you don't understand-- I need to get out of here now.
why don't you tell me what's really going on here, Whistler?
why do you keep looking at your watch?
what are you really up to?
Scofield, the men are gone-- let's move.
I need your cell phone.
no, Sammy's on his way-- get out of here.
I have to call my brother.
no, cell phone stays with me.
now, get out of here!
well, just so that we're clear, Americano, she's got no electricity and no running water.
Septic's out, too, but there's an outhouse in the woods.
it's perfect.
a hundred bucks a month.
a hundred bucks a month.
deal.
but I don't want growing no drugs on the land.
no marijuana.
you got that?
welcome home, my friend.
Thanks.
listen, man, if you want to get out of here,
I'd get it and Michael would, too.
Yove done more than enough.
if I had a kid in the same situation as your son, would you and your brother walk out on me?
Yeah.
here, this is good.
put it down there.
okay, hold on.
you ready?
Yeah.
I hope this works.
all right, let's go.
I need your help.
not now, bro-- my father finally got here;
I'm gonna go see him.
actually, uh, I need his help, too.
what you want from my old man?
I just need someone to deliver a message on the outside, someone I can trust.
hell, no.
my papa's straight as razor blade.
he don't get into kind of trouble like you do.
it's not trouble-- it's just a phone call.
no.
I love my father.
and I love my brother
and if he doesn't get this message, something horrible's gonna happen to him.
something really bad is going on.
please.
Hello, son.
Papa.
you look very handsome.
like your school picture.
gracias.
I cleaned a guy's cell for this shirt.
you should be in school now...
it's okay, papa.
with your friends.
Papa, please, don't get upset.
I-I have friends in here.
the american?
Yes.
he's nice.
he keeps his word-- it's very rare in Sona.
and, uh...
he needs my help.
thank god you're here.
thought you might have come a little earlier, just to make sure I was okay.
I read the newspaper;
I knew you were safe.
I am for now
but you might not be.
now, listen to me carefully.
promise me you won't go anywhere near Lincoln burrows today.
it's just too dangerous to be around him, to be with him, to be near him.
just go home and stay there, and I will call you tonight.
that's all I can say.
do you understand?
call me?
from where?
do you understand me?
Yeah.
promise me.
say it out loud.
I promise.
why are you so scared?
because I can't have you get hurt.
because I love you...
more than anything in the world.
do you?
Yeah.
James, I got a call today from a man who said he's your landlord.
talking about another apartment.
should I call him back?
must have been a wrong number.
he asked for you by name.
the man is clearly confused.
I don't know anything about another apartment.
Sofia, all I know is that you've got to stay away from Lincoln.
please.
okay, James.
I'll wait for your call.
here.
I have this.
I don't want to see it.
I'll...put it with the others.
I'm not coming home.
accept that.
you should go.
make that call for my friend.
happy birthday, son.
maybe we should pick up some locks and secure the house.
it can't have anything new on it.
the place needs to look abandoned.
yeah?
I have a message for you.
don't come home for dinner.
who is this?
I'm supposed to tell you, don't come home for dinner.
what?
when me and Mikey were kids, we had a code when social services were trying to get me into juvie.
he's telling me to watch my back.
what the hell are you doing here?
why haven't you returned my calls or my car?
you have him?
Yeah, he just arrived back at his hotel.
but Whistler's girl tracked him down.
and she's talking to Lincoln and the Mexican.
after what she saw today, she could be complicating things.
you have a directive?
I warned her.
take them all out.
at will Whistler say?
I said take them all out.
bout your boyfriend's apartment on the side, I just don't care.
no, I went there.
and a woman showed up; she threatened me.
she knows James.
you know her?
she's the one who has LJ.
well, she took something I found, a passport.
it had James' cture and birthday but his name said Gary Miller.
lincoln, I don't know what's going on.
I'll tell you what's going on-- your boyfriend's a liar.
I told you that from the start.
James told me to stay away from you today, that it was dangerous.
let's go.
I need to speak to Michael Scofield.
I'm his brother.
how you get this number?
he called me a few days back.
I-I didn't answer.
but, listen, I-I need to speak to him now.
let's go.
you'll never guess who that was.
michael scofield's brother.
who calls me...
and who I call, is my business.
where are your friends?
I don't know.
where are your friends?
I don't know, please don't shoot.
please.
drop it.
different day, same problem, huh, Lincoln?
you know how it turned out when LJ was in this position, and today is no different...
so be a good boy and put down the gun.
come on, Linc.
I know you've learned your lesson.
you're right, I have.
for the record, this is an international hearing, requested by the united states government, for the purpose of hearing testimony from one mr. Alexander mahone.
you gotta be kidding me.
Mr. Mahone, when were you first contacted by anyone from the group referred to as the company?
they told me...
that if I didn't kill every one of the fox river eight, that they would come after me.
they had all worked with-with Scofield on-on-on the escape, so the company wasn't sure what they knew.
Mr. Mahone, I'm going to ask you to please keep your answer related to the question.
it's-it's all connected. It's just...
it's-it's a web.
and-and it's a web that I got caught in.
and-and Lincoln Burrows got caught in, and Michael Scofield got caught in.
I, if I may, I think what Mr. Mahone...
we're all just like flies... -was trying to say...
thank you, Mr. Sullins, but we're here to hear from Mr. Mahone.
now, we're going to try this again.
when were you first contacted by the company?
I cannot say.
you know...
they could be in contact with you or-or-or...
you could be in contact with them, you'd never know.
It's-it's...
they could be in contact with us right now.
I know...
it sounds crazy, right?
it's craz...
and...and it would be, except for the simple fact that...
it's true.
the government that I had dedicated my life to manipulate and extorted me.
blackmailed me.
so that I would kill for them.
and I did the things that they made me do so I could protect my family.
and so...
I would like to go home.
so can I do that, please?
Hey.
where have you been?
I came looking for scrap metal for the support brace for the tunnel.
Really?
looks like a pretty tight squeeze up there.
you sure there's enough fresh air, or does the claustrophobia come and go?
what's it like going through life always distrustful?
you tell me, James.
ate to break up the brouhaha, gentlemen, but Lechero would like to see you.
ays it has something to do with your big brother.
leave us a moment, will you, Teodoro?
if your brother should ever call my cell phone again, you tell him you're the one that's gonna pay.
yeah?
you got the message.
Yeah, you were right.
they just tried to take us out.
I know.
Whistler got a visit from the company.
he's been acting strange ever since.
I'm telling you, Linc, something's up.
doing more than acting strange, man.
he just told sofia not to be near me 'cause it's dangerous.
the company's coming after us.
they don't need us anymore.
here we go.
they're breaking him out on their own.
we're 100 yards from the target.
keep your eyes open.
let's get in and out fast.
come on!
Damn!
come on!
come on! Keep it coming!
come on!
I've got a helicopter and two inmates.
I can't make out their faces, but they're on the roof!
come on!
can't get a clean shot!
I'll get lower, take 'em out!
man down.
let go!
we lost Whistler.
we lost Whistler.
abort.
mission failure.
return to base one immediately.
I'm so sorry.
I'm going to have to take you back to Sona.
you, get up.
Mr. Scofield, there have been two escape attempts in the past two days.
somehow I don't think it's a coincidence ed shortly before they happened.
I had nothing to do with that.
you've caused too many problems here in Sona, so maybe you shouldn't be here in Sona.
say good-bye to Sona, Mr. Scofield.
Sona's a one-way street.
what goes in... never comes out.
they got me and Sara.
LJ and Sara will be traded for Whistler.
are we clear?
I'll tell you the plan when you tell me who you are.
I'm a fisherman.
Really?
my life is in your hands.
how's LJ? How's Sara?
she's dead, Michael.
I lied to you.
I'm James Whistler's girlfriend
you are breaking out of this prison, Mr. Scofield, and you're taking me with you.
four more days.
if I'm out of here by then, I can still do it.
there have been two escape attempts in the past two days.
say good-bye to Sona, Mr. Scofield.
right there, leave us.
my predecessor, colonel Escamilla, wasn't an effective leader.
he's been replaced.
I am general Zavala.
sit.
a drink of water?
with all due respect, general, I had nothing to do with what happened here today.
I always conduct a thorough investigation, and there are too many unanswered questions here.
it is my job to find those answers.
if you help me do my job, I'll help you.
the helicopters.
you alone couldn't be responsible for that.
you certainly weren't flying a helicopter, were you? - No.
who was? - I don't know.
but you know who sent them. - No.
again, be advised-- telling the truth is in your best interest.
I am.
let's go for a walk.
I understand your fears, but the republic of panama cannot allow this sort of activity.
if you wish to talk, now is the time.
I would... if there was anything left to say.
then you give me no choice.
this way.
this isn't good.
they're putting him in the hot box.
things are gonna get much harder for you.
there's no way to win.
you must cooperate.
confess to this escape and face your punishment by law, or face a far greater punishment in the panama sun.
it's up to you.
he's done.
he's finished.
I hope my brother's all right.
does it hurt?
it's fine.
I'm gonna get to the prison.
I was watching the news in the waiting room.
they identified a few bodies, but... it wasn't them.
I'll find out when I get there.
you want to come?
I don't, I don't know.
after everything that's happened, I don't know what to think anymore.
what more is there to think about?
James has an answer for everything, and nothing ever makes sense.
you need to stop asking questions and just look at the facts.
I wanted to believe everything he was saying, and I still want him to get out.
I want him out as well.
trust me, I've been working on this every single day.
lincoln, I really appreciate everything you have done.
you saved my life.
you didn't have to help me like that.
Yeah. I did.
get in the car.
come on.
everywhere I go, there you are.
go home, Sofia.
part of me wanted to drive right past this gate, Alex.
you don't deserve to be here.
actually, if you take all things into consideration... I do.
thank you.
wait.
don't.
my father worked in a mine for 30 years, he took this into work with him every day.
kept him safe till the day he retired.
then he gave it to me.
I can't take this.
give it back when you get out.
take care of yourself, Alex.
Yeah.
what? You ain't got the guts to do it yourself?
Hey.
this is for you, so shut up before I change my mind.
after yesterday, you may be doubting my ability to make good on our agreement.
I need to keep you motivated.
you have one minute.
dad!
LJ.LJ, thank god you're alive.
no, forget about it. There's nothing you can do.
there's always something. - No, dad.
these guys are thorough.
they follow you everywhere.
trust me.
that bitch is crazy.
she cut Sara's head off.
I was there.
I closed my eyes, but I heard it.
you listen to me.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, all right?
the next time you see me, don't take your eyes off me.
I'll tell you what to do. All right?
minute's up.
me and your uncle, we know what we're doing.
we're gonna get you out of this.
I love you. - I love you, dad.
looks like things didn't go so well.
you should be gone.
so should you.
what happened?
it's still happening.
I feel bad for Michael, but we have a way without him.
you should get some rest.
what's the way?
I'll rest. I'll rest. I'll rest when I'm out.
I won't go without you.
you have my word.
now get some rest.
you see Scofield out in that redneck sauna?
let's see if he has the tattoo to get out of that one.
you were in on it, right?
I see you guys lurking around Lechero.
Scofield's gotta have a plan to escape.
if so, I know none of it.
Yeah, I bet you don't.
too many cocktails out on the lido deck.
here comes trouble.
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
you heard what I said.
I told you to do something.
now do it.
cleaning up chunks ain't in my job description anymore.
Oh, things changed.
you see, you answer to us now.
Hey, caveman, you don't scare me.
go bug someone else.
what are you doing here?
I have a special delivery.
I need to get it in real quick.
how much?
I gave you ten grand.
ten grand was the last one. How much for this one?
no grand.
then no thanks.
I think you might...
...want to reconsider.
take this water to the prisoner.
why should I? He doesn't deserve it.
I'll do it.
Hi, brother.
remember me?
this isn't gonna work.
come on, papi, drink this.
don't let anything happen to LJ, okay?
it's okay.
he's doing much better than you.
come on. Drink this. You need it.
I'm sorry about Sara.
I'm gonna try to sneak more into the prison next time, okay?
I want you to quit.
I can't.
we all have to quit sometime.
no, Michael.
you're here in a chicken coop-- you need all the help you can get.
don't need your help. Just go, and don't look back.
not after everything you've done for me.
go.
so you tried to catch a flight out of here yesterday?
I had to do what I had to do.
Yeah, but you went back on our deal.
I was saving my own ass.
I'm sure you're familiar with the strategy.
now, you watch it.
I'm still boss here.
who cares about who's boss?
do you want to get out of here, or do you want to keep talking about it?
it's okay.
we just need to brace it.
no. We need the engineer.
move it.
let's get out of here before Sammy gets back.
98 degrees in the shade, 125 in the box.
let's go inside.
we'll have a chat in the air conditioning.
tomorrow is going to be hotter, the next day, even hotter.
the day after that, you'll be dead.
you don't understand.
if I thought you could help me...
I can.
you're unaware of the influence I have in this province.
you'd rather I be your ally than your enemy, wouldn't you?
you n't know these people.
we can't stop them-- not you, not me.
there was a man-- a drug kingpin-- the most powerful man in Panama.
a ruthless killer with an army of thugs and thieves behind him.
he killed judges and policemen, anyone who stood in his way.
they said he couldn't be stopped either, but now Lechero is in prison, and I'm in power.
I decide whose life is at stake, and right now, it is yours.
from the moment I got here...
I've been planning my escape.
he's talking.
how do you know?
you can't get out of the box any other way.
the people who sent the helicopters, they're the same people who framed my brother back in the U. S.
the same people who wanted me here in Sona.
in order for you to break out another inmate?
Yes.
who are these people?
I don't know, but they have my brother's son.
they like to keep collateral.
I could be putting his life in danger as we speak.
if what you told me is true...
...you would be saving him.
I would call my troops and order a search for the boy immediately.
but this story... it's fiction.
it's true.
it's what you wanted. It's the only thing I have left to give.
please.
his name is LJ.
he's only 16 years old.
what's that smell?
Armandos.
these things cost money.
somebody gave them to me-- I don't even smoke those things.
who?
this guy I ran some stuff into the prison for, man.
you ran some stuff into the prison? Like what? Drugs?
I don't know. Who cares? He paid me.
you should have quit that job, I...
I know, okay? I need some cash for my kid.
Maricruz doesn't have insurance, all right?
listen. I... I just saw Michael.
he's in solitary confinement.
what?
they put him in a box out in the middle of the yard, all by himself.
he can't do anything.
it's going to be okay.
it's not going to be okay.
I don't know what to do, man.
everything's just fallen apart.
what you lookin' at?
the view.
I can't help but notice you and Lechero made friends.
he's been hanging out with a lot of white boys lately.
got a problem with that?
no. But Sammy does.
see, I've been looking close, like I always do.
and I know you all would be a lot better off if Sammy were no longer around.
wouldn't have to worry about his snout poking in your business.
and you're suggesting...?
you and I both know it needs to happen.
there aren't many men in Sona who would take out sammy.
I have one particular man in mind.
a man who owes me.
but if I pull through, I'm in the club, guaranteed.
you're gonna see to it.
I assume you have the power to make this deal.
I do. Agreed.
right.
well. Thank you, sir.
look, I've been thinking about what you told me and, uh... but I can't quit my job.
do whatever you want to do.
well, I would if you could kick me a few bucks, you know.
are we gonna do this again? I told you.
I don't have any cash.
what do you expect me to do?
do whatever you want.
you could use my help, right?
you're gonna start charging me now for your friendship?
I got a kion the way!
and I got a kid I may never see again.
Yeah, get me Gretchen.
much to my surprise, there seems to be some degree of truth to your tale.
everything I told you is true.
that's for me to determine.
what more can I say?
this inmate.
the one who you've been sent to free.
he should be able to verify what you've told me.
he should but... I don't know if he will.
tell me his name.
these people won't hesitate to kill my nephew.
I need to know you're gonna do everything you can to find him.
I will, but I need a name.
I need your word.
you have it.
I'll find the boy.
now, the name.
Hi.
what's wrong?
why don't you tell me?
I went to that apartment, your apartment.
and this woman showed up like she knew you.
and then I found a passport.
who's Gary Miller?
that apartment, that passport, it's all for us.
it's how we're gonna get away.
when I get out of this place, I'll be working on a way for us to be together.
remember how we always talked about france?
Yeah.
our plan to be together.
James, how... how can I believe you?
how can I believe anything anymore?
and just know, just know that I love you.
you're facing some serious charges.
michael Scofield told me there are some people out there who are very determined to get you out of here.
what's he talking about?
you know nothing about this?
no.
Scofield's a smart man but, uh, he's got a rabid imagination.
so you're calling him a liar?
more or less.
I've been able to verify the story.
I already know everything, Mr. Whistler, in detail.
I just need a name.
who's in charge on the outside?
we can end this right now if you can provide it.
what are you talking about?
what's going on here?
now, start over.
there you are.
and here I am, without my bag of goodies.
I was afraid you were gone for good.
party would not be the same without you.
I'm glad you're back, cause I need a favor.
it involves you, a chicken foot and a man who's got it comin'.
what man?
now, you get well, and you get him out there in that ring, and you do that one, that... neck thing.
in exchange, I'm gonna cover all your medical expenses.
I'll tell you what. You take your time.
I'm gonna go get my bag right now, put you out of this misery.
you're the best cock in the fight, Alex.
please don't let me down.
maybe now you'll feel more comfortable telling me the truth.
are you working with Scofield?
are you working with Scofield?! - Yes! Yes, I'm working with Scofield.
but there's no one else involved.
as they say in America, we're gonna get this story straight.
I told him the truth.
I suggest you do the same.
I have.
he's confirmed nothing!
ask him about that woman he's been meeting with.
huh?
that's not what you think.
doesn't matter what I think; it matters what you know, and you know her name.
and the fact that he won't admit it tells me that he's no innocent bystander in this.
you know I am.
prove it.
cause that's the only way we're getting out of here.
Michael, this is suicide-- they'll kill Sofia.
and they'll kill your brother's son.
this is the man who can help us, and he can't do anything without a name, so tell him!
James... we don't have a choice.
it's over.
I don't know where she lives, I don't know how you find her.
that's all I know, her name.
two more of those, please.
I'm gonna get going.
no, he'll stay.
Relax...Fernando, is it?
I just want to talk a minute.
alone.
this right here is as alone as we're gonna get.
I heard about your argument with Lincoln.
you people are everywhere, huh?
now, you know him better than I do, but from personal experience, Burrows can be hard to handle.
that man does not like to be told what to do.
he sure likes bossing everyone else around.
you have to start looking out for yourself, Fernando.
level the playing field.
all you have to do is go back, apologize, tell him that you'll stay on a few more days for free.
and tomorrow or the day after, I'll call you, and you'll meet me for a drink.
in exchange, I'll pay.
50 grand.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not asking you to do anything that doesn't help everyone in the long run.
I don't see how this is helping.
Lincoln causes as many problems as he solves.
he needs to get out of his own way, and I think you can assist him.
I stay one step ahead, and you get 50 grand.
I don't know.
I think you do.
where do I find this Gretchen Morgan?
she's somewhere here in Panama city.
Aw, that's not much help in a city of a million people.
it could take days, weeks.
I've told you.
I only know her name.
I have no idea. - I do.
but I'll need to use your phone.
what phone are you on?
just listen to me.
I need to know where and when your next meeting with Susan b is.
Garfield-price building downtown in an hour. Why?
Garfield-price, one hour.
can you give her a message for me? - Yeah.
tell her everything is going as planned.
what the hell's going on, Michael?
just give her the message, Linc.
I'll see you soon.
you should have listened.
are you going to throw down a chicken foot over a puddle of puke?
you should have mopped.
stumpy, wait your turn, man.
excuse me.
what you want to see him about?
I got one ofhese from him, and I didn't do nothing.
he don't listen.
the fight goes on as planned-- after we eat lunch.
you issue a fight? - Yeah.
what about it?
it's not your right.
it's not your place.
well, maybe it should be.
general: She's arrived?
I'm on my way.
you'd better be right.
what happened?
it worked.
it did? - Yeah.
she came up to me just like you said and offered me a bunch of cash to talk behind your back.
so we stick with the plan, right?
Yeah. - Cool.
I'm going to see her right now.
it's okay.
I came back for you.
come on, now, everything's gonna be okay.
you can't deprive yourself like this.
G-get out of here.
you don't mean that.
yeah... yeah, I do. I do.
talk straight.
you're not talking straight.
withdrawals are the worst way to die.
you're going to shake, and you'll sweat until you evaporate into nothing.
it's a long bumpy road to hell.
is that what you want, Alex? Or do you wanna live?
see you on the other side.
when you're up all night...
with diarrhea running down both your legs and vomit is in your hair...
...don't come crawling back.
it's been a long day.
let's just get this over with.
I got a message from my brother.
everything is going ahead as planned.
Really?
I would think you'd be facing a major setback.
you know Michael.
always has things worked out.
no, I don't.
seems to me he keeps screwing things up.
he's getting things done a whole lot faster than you.
Whistler's out by tomorrow, all right?
Zavala: Gretchen Morgan?
Yes.
general Zavala, Panamanian national police.
come with us, please.
Why? What's this all about? - Llevenla.
no, I don't understand. I don't understand. Wait!
I had nothing to do with this.
I had nothing to do with this! Nothing!
you're denying that you are involved with escape attempts at Sona prison.
I have never been here before in my life.
and you've never met any of the men incarcerated here?
No!
James whistler?
no.
you know what I've been told?
from prisoners?
I can only imagine.
I've been told that you are the mastermind behind a prison escape and that you've kidnapped a boy as collateral.
Really?
am I an alien?
did I shoot?
sir, I have no idea who this James Wilson...
Whistler. - ...Is!
I'm just here to relax before I have to go back to another year of teaching social studies to freshman idiots.
you're a tourist here?
no, not a tourist, sir.
I like to think of myself as a "student of life."
"a student of life"?
what did he say?
turn on the hose.
I'm going to give you one chance.
did you order the escape from Sona penitentiary?
yes or no?
Zavala: Yes or no?
you seem concerned for her.
she holds our entire future in her hands.
Yeah, I'm concerned.
yes or no?
No!
you've proven one thing.
this is not your first time.
come with me.
do you know either of these men?
I've never seen them before.
that's a lie.
I've never seen them before in my life.
where and when have you seen her?
she came to see him in visitation, isn't that right?
is this the woman you work for?
did she order the prison escape?
yes or no?
Yes.
all right, all right.
you're the one in charge?
no.
I don't know anything about a prison escape.
I'm just the baby-sitter.
I watch the kid.
where is he?
near Paloma.
Highway 2.
I can take you.
take them back to my office.
put the girl back in the car.
we're going on a drive.
was it you?
did you kill Sara?
I have no idea who you're talking about.
I'm coming for you.
Congratulations.
you're a regular Buster Douglas, aren't you?
Hey, what is this?
how'd you get that up there, huh?
right there. Right there. He's in there.
in here?
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
: I hope he's all right.
pick me up.
I'm at the shack.
bring towels.
Hi, Lincoln.
good to see you.
Yeah, thanks for the cigars.
you didn't open the package?
I didn't get around to it today.
you need to make a choice.
Lechero's days are numbered.
you agree?
then you know what you need to do.
you've done a good job so far.
now is the time to make a move.
prove yourself.
go back in and open the package.
what are they doing in here?
they were here for questioning.
come on. Let's go.
what happened to the general?
the general was found dead this morning off highway 2.
you're goingback inside.
I'm sorry to hear that.
he seemed like a nice man.
what you doing back here?
if you still want to getout of here, I need your phone.
go inside.
what?
how's LJ?
he's fine. You know what?
Susan's not.
he's fine? Are you sure?
Yeah.
I just got off the phone with him.
why didn't you tell me what was going on?
he could have died because of what you did.
we've still got whistler.
as long as we do, we're okay.
I got to go.
Hey, did you see Blanco?
s walking around like the landlord.
I thought you said Lechero was going to take care of it?
he will.
how long has he been saying that?
look if you and Lechero want to go around like an old married couple, fighting this way or that... maybe you like it in the kitchen.
Hey, you be careful.
then do something!
or the next thing you know, you're gonna be taking orders from scofield.
some people stop at nothing, huh?
uh... yeah. Whatever.
at least we're back inside.
which of course is exactly what you wanted.
isn't it?
what are you talking about?
you let the fox into the henhouse.
the only reason you gave up gretchen's name was so she could come in and pull you out of the fire.
you wanted me to give up her name.
you know it doesn't end with her.
Yeah, I do.
the question is how do you?
how does a simple fisherman seem to know so much about the company?
when she comes back, and she will... ...
what am I gonna say?
you gonna do this or not?
you can tell her the answer is yeS.
but once we're out, I consider you collateral...
nothing more.
Sona's a one-way street.
what goes in... never comes out.
they got me and Sara.
LJ and Sara will be traded for Whistler.
are we clear?
I'll tell you the plan when you tell me who you are.
I'm a fisherman.
Really?
my life is in your hands.
how's LJ? How's Sara?
she's dead, Michael.
I lied to you.
I'm James Whistler's girlfriend
you are breaking out of this prison, Mr. Scofield, and you're taking me with you.
four more days.
if I'm out of here by then, I can still do it.
there have been two escape attempts in the past two days.
say good-bye to Sona, Mr. Scofield.
right there, leave us.
my predecessor, colonel Escamilla, wasn't an effective leader.
he's been replaced.
I am general Zavala.
sit.
a drink of water?
with all due respect, general, I had nothing to do with what happened here today.
I always conduct a thorough investigation, and there are too many unanswered questions here.
it is my job to find those answers.
if you help me do my job, I'll help you.
the helicopters.
you alone couldn't be responsible for that.
you certainly weren't flying a helicopter, were you? - No.
who was? - I don't know.
but you know who sent them. - No.
again, be advised-- telling the truth is in your best interest.
I am.
let's go for a walk.
I understand your fears, but the republic of panama cannot allow this sort of activity.
if you wish to talk, now is the time.
I would... if there was anything left to say.
then you give me no choice.
this way.
this isn't good.
they're putting him in the hot box.
things are gonna get much harder for you.
there's no way to win.
you must cooperate.
confess to this escape and face your punishment by law, or face a far greater punishment in the panama sun.
it's up to you.
he's done.
he's finished.
I hope my brother's all right.
does it hurt?
it's fine.
I'm gonna get to the prison.
I was watching the news in the waiting room.
they identified a few bodies, but... it wasn't them.
I'll find out when I get there.
you want to come?
I don't, I don't know.
after everything that's happened, I don't know what to think anymore.
what more is there to think about?
James has an answer for everything, and nothing ever makes sense.
you need to stop asking questions and just look at the facts.
I wanted to believe everything he was saying, and I still want him to get out.
I want him out as well.
trust me, I've been working on this every single day.
lincoln, I really appreciate everything you have done.
you saved my life.
you didn't have to help me like that.
Yeah. I did.
get in the car.
come on.
everywhere I go, there you are.
go home, Sofia.
part of me wanted to drive right past this gate, Alex.
you don't deserve to be here.
actually, if you take all things into consideration... I do.
thank you.
wait.
don't.
my father worked in a mine for 30 years, he took this into work with him every day.
kept him safe till the day he retired.
then he gave it to me.
I can't take this.
give it back when you get out.
take care of yourself, Alex.
Yeah.
what? You ain't got the guts to do it yourself?
Hey.
this is for you, so shut up before I change my mind.
after yesterday, you may be doubting my ability to make good on our agreement.
I need to keep you motivated.
you have one minute.
dad!
LJ.LJ, thank god you're alive.
no, forget about it. There's nothing you can do.
there's always something. - No, dad.
these guys are thorough.
they follow you everywhere.
trust me.
that bitch is crazy.
she cut Sara's head off.
I was there.
I closed my eyes, but I heard it.
you listen to me.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, all right?
the next time you see me, don't take your eyes off me.
I'll tell you what to do. All right?
minute's up.
me and your uncle, we know what we're doing.
we're gonna get you out of this.
I love you. - I love you, dad.
looks like things didn't go so well.
you should be gone.
so should you.
what happened?
it's still happening.
I feel bad for Michael, but we have a way without him.
you should get some rest.
what's the way?
I'll rest. I'll rest. I'll rest when I'm out.
I won't go without you.
you have my word.
now get some rest.
you see Scofield out in that redneck sauna?
let's see if he has the tattoo to get out of that one.
you were in on it, right?
I see you guys lurking around Lechero.
Scofield's gotta have a plan to escape.
if so, I know none of it.
Yeah, I bet you don't.
too many cocktails out on the lido deck.
here comes trouble.
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
you heard what I said.
I told you to do something.
now do it.
cleaning up chunks ain't in my job description anymore.
Oh, things changed.
you see, you answer to us now.
Hey, caveman, you don't scare me.
go bug someone else.
what are you doing here?
I have a special delivery.
I need to get it in real quick.
how much?
I gave you ten grand.
ten grand was the last one. How much for this one?
no grand.
then no thanks.
I think you might...
...want to reconsider.
take this water to the prisoner.
why should I? He doesn't deserve it.
I'll do it.
Hi, brother.
remember me?
this isn't gonna work.
come on, papi, drink this.
don't let anything happen to LJ, okay?
it's okay.
he's doing much better than you.
come on. Drink this. You need it.
I'm sorry about Sara.
I'm gonna try to sneak more into the prison next time, okay?
I want you to quit.
I can't.
we all have to quit sometime.
no, Michael.
you're here in a chicken coop-- you need all the help you can get.
don't need your help. Just go, and don't look back.
not after everything you've done for me.
go.
so you tried to catch a flight out of here yesterday?
I had to do what I had to do.
Yeah, but you went back on our deal.
I was saving my own ass.
I'm sure you're familiar with the strategy.
now, you watch it.
I'm still boss here.
who cares about who's boss?
do you want to get out of here, or do you want to keep talking about it?
it's okay.
we just need to brace it.
no. We need the engineer.
move it.
let's get out of here before Sammy gets back.
98 degrees in the shade, 125 in the box.
let's go inside.
we'll have a chat in the air conditioning.
tomorrow is going to be hotter, the next day, even hotter.
the day after that, you'll be dead.
you don't understand.
if I thought you could help me...
I can.
you're unaware of the influence I have in this province.
you'd rather I be your ally than your enemy, wouldn't you?
you n't know these people.
we can't stop them-- not you, not me.
there was a man-- a drug kingpin-- the most powerful man in Panama.
a ruthless killer with an army of thugs and thieves behind him.
he killed judges and policemen, anyone who stood in his way.
they said he couldn't be stopped either, but now Lechero is in prison, and I'm in power.
I decide whose life is at stake, and right now, it is yours.
from the moment I got here...
I've been planning my escape.
he's talking.
how do you know?
you can't get out of the box any other way.
the people who sent the helicopters, they're the same people who framed my brother back in the U. S.
the same people who wanted me here in Sona.
in order for you to break out another inmate?
Yes.
who are these people?
I don't know, but they have my brother's son.
they like to keep collateral.
I could be putting his life in danger as we speak.
if what you told me is true...
...you would be saving him.
I would call my troops and order a search for the boy immediately.
but this story... it's fiction.
it's true.
it's what you wanted. It's the only thing I have left to give.
please.
his name is LJ.
he's only 16 years old.
what's that smell?
Armandos.
these things cost money.
somebody gave them to me-- I don't even smoke those things.
who?
this guy I ran some stuff into the prison for, man.
you ran some stuff into the prison? Like what? Drugs?
I don't know. Who cares? He paid me.
you should have quit that job, I...
I know, okay? I need some cash for my kid.
Maricruz doesn't have insurance, all right?
listen. I... I just saw Michael.
he's in solitary confinement.
what?
they put him in a box out in the middle of the yard, all by himself.
he can't do anything.
it's going to be okay.
it's not going to be okay.
I don't know what to do, man.
everything's just fallen apart.
what you lookin' at?
the view.
I can't help but notice you and Lechero made friends.
he's been hanging out with a lot of white boys lately.
got a problem with that?
no. But Sammy does.
see, I've been looking close, like I always do.
and I know you all would be a lot better off if Sammy were no longer around.
wouldn't have to worry about his snout poking in your business.
and you're suggesting...?
you and I both know it needs to happen.
there aren't many men in Sona who would take out sammy.
I have one particular man in mind.
a man who owes me.
but if I pull through, I'm in the club, guaranteed.
you're gonna see to it.
I assume you have the power to make this deal.
I do. Agreed.
right.
well. Thank you, sir.
look, I've been thinking about what you told me and, uh... but I can't quit my job.
do whatever you want to do.
well, I would if you could kick me a few bucks, you know.
are we gonna do this again? I told you.
I don't have any cash.
what do you expect me to do?
do whatever you want.
you could use my help, right?
you're gonna start charging me now for your friendship?
I got a kion the way!
and I got a kid I may never see again.
Yeah, get me Gretchen.
much to my surprise, there seems to be some degree of truth to your tale.
everything I told you is true.
that's for me to determine.
what more can I say?
this inmate.
the one who you've been sent to free.
he should be able to verify what you've told me.
he should but... I don't know if he will.
tell me his name.
these people won't hesitate to kill my nephew.
I need to know you're gonna do everything you can to find him.
I will, but I need a name.
I need your word.
you have it.
I'll find the boy.
now, the name.
Hi.
what's wrong?
why don't you tell me?
I went to that apartment, your apartment.
and this woman showed up like she knew you.
and then I found a passport.
who's Gary Miller?
that apartment, that passport, it's all for us.
it's how we're gonna get away.
when I get out of this place, I'll be working on a way for us to be together.
remember how we always talked about france?
Yeah.
our plan to be together.
James, how... how can I believe you?
how can I believe anything anymore?
and just know, just know that I love you.
you're facing some serious charges.
michael Scofield told me there are some people out there who are very determined to get you out of here.
what's he talking about?
you know nothing about this?
no.
Scofield's a smart man but, uh, he's got a rabid imagination.
so you're calling him a liar?
more or less.
I've been able to verify the story.
I already know everything, Mr. Whistler, in detail.
I just need a name.
who's in charge on the outside?
we can end this right now if you can provide it.
what are you talking about?
what's going on here?
now, start over.
there you are.
and here I am, without my bag of goodies.
I was afraid you were gone for good.
party would not be the same without you.
I'm glad you're back, cause I need a favor.
it involves you, a chicken foot and a man who's got it comin'.
what man?
now, you get well, and you get him out there in that ring, and you do that one, that... neck thing.
in exchange, I'm gonna cover all your medical expenses.
I'll tell you what. You take your time.
I'm gonna go get my bag right now, put you out of this misery.
you're the best cock in the fight, Alex.
please don't let me down.
maybe now you'll feel more comfortable telling me the truth.
are you working with Scofield?
are you working with Scofield?! - Yes! Yes, I'm working with Scofield.
but there's no one else involved.
as they say in America, we're gonna get this story straight.
I told him the truth.
I suggest you do the same.
I have.
he's confirmed nothing!
ask him about that woman he's been meeting with.
huh?
that's not what you think.
doesn't matter what I think; it matters what you know, and you know her name.
and the fact that he won't admit it tells me that he's no innocent bystander in this.
you know I am.
prove it.
cause that's the only way we're getting out of here.
Michael, this is suicide-- they'll kill Sofia.
and they'll kill your brother's son.
this is the man who can help us, and he can't do anything without a name, so tell him!
James... we don't have a choice.
it's over.
I don't know where she lives, I don't know how you find her.
that's all I know, her name.
two more of those, please.
I'm gonna get going.
no, he'll stay.
Relax...Fernando, is it?
I just want to talk a minute.
alone.
this right here is as alone as we're gonna get.
I heard about your argument with Lincoln.
you people are everywhere, huh?
now, you know him better than I do, but from personal experience, Burrows can be hard to handle.
that man does not like to be told what to do.
he sure likes bossing everyone else around.
you have to start looking out for yourself, Fernando.
level the playing field.
all you have to do is go back, apologize, tell him that you'll stay on a few more days for free.
and tomorrow or the day after, I'll call you, and you'll meet me for a drink.
in exchange, I'll pay.
50 grand.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not asking you to do anything that doesn't help everyone in the long run.
I don't see how this is helping.
Lincoln causes as many problems as he solves.
he needs to get out of his own way, and I think you can assist him.
I stay one step ahead, and you get 50 grand.
I don't know.
I think you do.
where do I find this Gretchen Morgan?
she's somewhere here in Panama city.
Aw, that's not much help in a city of a million people.
it could take days, weeks.
