if the president protects you, commander
if the president returns on labor day,
if the president stays this course...
if the president turns more of his attention to rebuilding the institutions of global governance cementing the role of the g20, repurposing the international monetary fund, pressing forward on global financial reform his setback at home could bring benefits.
if the president turns those planes around,
