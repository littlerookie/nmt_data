do you smell that? - What? Disinfectant?
no, it just... seems familiar.
try to open your eyes if you can.
uh, sorry. I just got a little lightheaded there.
does your shoulder hurt?
Yeah, like hell.
I just had the weirdest memory.
what? What did you remember?
something that's not possible.
look, this is gonna sound nuts, but I think I remember getting shot.
dinner's almost-- where you going?
out.
that cracking sound you hear is the ice you're standing on.
relax. It's just a party.
are you forgetting what happened last night?
how could I? Am I grounded?
you're this close.
what is goin' on, Ned?
why don't you just talk to me?
you wanna talk? Fine.
let's talk about this.
Yeah. - Hey, Delia, it's Marla.
look, about your call earlier, I'm pretty embarrassed.
I was with my daughter, so I sort of told a little fib.
anyway, yeah, the joint's mine. I'm sorry. Just...
you're mad at me about something that wasn't even my fault when the whole time you were here getting high with your friends.
no, I wasn't, and I-I'm sorry that I accused you, but
mom, your friend Angie's here, too.
she showed me your yearbook, so I don't think you wanna be lecturing me about anything.
Ned, Angie was always a troublemaker, and she still is, and for some reason,
she is trying to get between the two of us.
your friends called you Doobie-ah.
you're all over me about something I'm not even doing when obviously you did.
Hey, this is not about me.
so you're saying you did.
no. I am saying
now who's not being honest?
now who's grounded?
why don't you just go into your room until we can have a rational conversation about this.
sounds like never to me.
I know it must be painful, but it's...
a good sign you're remembering.
Yeah, but remembering what?
everything my family tells me, none of this fits-- the emergency medical knowledge,
the taste of food I'm allergic to, getting shot.
Melinda, I feel like I'm losing my mind.
or maybe you're finding it.
I-it's possible.
maybe you're trying to remember the wrong life.
what do you mean?
well, you have this idea cause you are based on what other people have told you,
so that's the same that you're trying to get back to but--but maybe just...
maybe there's this-- this whole other person inside you entirely.
wait a minute. Eli talked about some kind of regression back to a past life.
is that what you mean? - Maybe.
if you just open your mind...
and your heart, maybe you'll find the key.
you mean a key like a place...
or a person.
sure.
someone who's always been there for me, someone who knew me better than anyone else.
that's right.
it's gotta be Nicole.
Nicole, hi. It's Sam.
look, I'm sorry I keep leaving you these messages,
but I mean, everything I told you about the accident and my memory, please, it's all true.
and I was hoping maybe you would help me...
Nicole, no, it's too much of a burden to put on you to ask you to help me with all that after what I put you through, so...
if you need to move on, maybe--maybe that's better for both of us.
be well.
you're not answering your phone.
I left my cell in the car. Sorry. Did you talk to Ned?
more like yelled with.
so you got angry. - I know. I know.
we both did, and then he busted me.
and thanks to Marla and Jody, all of my credibility is gone.
parents don't have credibility.
Hi, Angie. I'm Eli.
Yeah, the shrink. I know.
nice to meet you, too.
your parents tried counseling? - Yeah. Look how well that turned out.
now Delia's just like them.
she says you're acting like her parents.
why does she care?
because you used to be so cool.
she's hangin' around because she thought you were cool, but now she thinks you're a hypocrite.
Yes.
I lied to my son, because I'm old enough now to want to protect him,
and if that means I'm a hard-ass, then that's the way it's gonna be.
you're just an ass.
Oh, that was Angie. It wasn't me.
she says she thinks-- -I don't care what you think, Angie. I really don't.
I just wanna protect my son from ever ending up like you.
well, you can seriously go...
what?
well, looks like somebody's gonna miss the party of the century.
can't. Grounded.
you're gonna let that stop you?
come on, man. Your mom's not even home.
Hey, Angie?
come on. Life's short.
trust me on that.
Hey, is this music too loud for you?
blondie?
well, at least he's got good taste.
Yeah, I'm not so sure it's his.
Ned! Honey, I'm comin' in.
what kind of party is under a bridge?
I think it's the next block up.
you mean that place with all the cop cars?
my god.
excuse me. I am looking for my son, Ned Banks.
sorry, ma'am. You're gonna have to come down to the precinct.
are you arresting everyone?
Yes, ma'am. Drugs and alcohol.
where the hell is he?
he went home. Wuss.
he went home.
what?
I brought trivia cards just to help pass the time.
trivia? With me?
right. Bad idea. Sorry.
I hope I did the right thing here.
the important thing is you tried.
well, with your help. Thank you.
you do that, you know, not just with me.
Yeah, random acts of kindness.
right.
I gotta say you're kind of amazing.
I mean, you're a little strange, too.
so are you. Amazing.
amazing. Not--not strange.
would it be wrong of me to want to...
run into a little traffic here?
why would you want that?
make the trip last a little bit longer.
do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?
no, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me all about it.
OK, let's all try to-- - first of all, you're grounded.
second of all, you're grounded.
was it really worth it just risking your life for some party?
that's a little dramatic, don't you think?
I didn't really risk my life.
guys, if you'll just let me
when we got there, the police were arresting almost all of those kids, and 2 of them were taken away in an ambulance.
I left before they got there.
you weren't supposed to be there the first place.
Yeah, at least he's still alive, and i would be, too, if it weren't for my parents.
I told you, Ned-- - Wait.
Angie's here.
you know what? I have had it with her.
actually, I think you may wanna hear this.
Angie, what did you mean about being dead because of your parents?
I wasn't walking back home the night I was killed.
I was walking back to the party to be with my friends.
it's the only place I felt safe.
you were walking back to the party.
Yes, because by the time I'd gotten home, I was 5 minutes late, 5 stinking minutes late, and my dad locked me out of the house.
so I started walking back to the party, and I was crying so hard...
I didn't even hear that car.
what is it? What's going on?
she says her parents locked her out of the house that night,
because she missed her curfew by 5 minutes.
they were that strict.
that's horrible.
I would never do that to Ned.
she says you already have, locked him out, because you're lying to him.
and she wants to know how's he ever gonna learn from your mistakes if you're not being honest with him?
that's not...
OK. You're right.
but you know, what happened to you, I learned such a huge lesson.
what I mean is a lot of this is because of you.
when Jody called me that morning to tell me that you were dead,
my whole life was completely changed.
and when I finally stopped crying,
I vowed that I would never let anything like that happen to somebody I cared about.
so I guess...
I wouldn't be the mom I am if I hadn't known you.
and I wouldn't have a son like Ned.
if my parents talked to me like that...
it's never too late, even now.
you can talk to them.
that's genius, Einstein.
I'm dead.
that's what I'm here for.
I already called them.
just so you know, when I got to that party, I saw how crazy it was, so I turned around and came home.
I'm proud of you, Ned.
I'm not sure that's what I would have done when I was your age.
and I'm sorry for the way I acted.
good. Me, too.
the truth is I'm always gonna worry about you.
and the drugs and the drinking, I know they're all around,
and its not that I don't trust your judgment.
it's just what happens to your judgment the second you're drunk or getting high.
mom, I know.
I'm sorry you lost your friend.
me, too.
thank you.
I guess thers nothin' like a road trip to help you forget your past.
I mean my past, not your past. I'm sure yours is fine.
no, I need to move forward, too.
that's good to hear.
Hey, uh, look, I know we just got here.
but, um, you wanna go down to the village? I don't know.
we could go to a restaurant or, um...
hit a bookstore. The only bookstore.
uh, or we could just, you know, get a movie and then have takeout, come back here, and...
we could, uh...
go to a hardware store a-and take some spackle and then...
Spackle?
you know, I think I've forgotten how to do this along with everything else.
do what?
ask somebody out.
is that what you're doing? - Yeah.
I got your message, and--and then I spoke to Cheryl.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my god. It's true. You don't know who I am, do you?
I'm sorry.
you must be Nicole.
Nikki. It's nikki.
No!
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, MELINDA.
not YOU.
you HAVE TO CROSS OVER.
I DON'T WANT TO.
Jim, NO!
you're BACK.
do I KNOW YOU?
I SEE THE SAME GUY THAT YOU SEE
different HAIR, NOSE, EYES. IT'S NOT JIM.
I JUST KNOW WHAT I SEE WHEN I LOOK IN THOSE EYES,
and JIM IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE.
Heh. WAIT. YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME YOU THINK I'M YOUR HUSBAND REINCARNATED,
because YOU'RE THE ONLY SANE PERSON I'VE MET SINCE I WOKE UP.
I BOUGHT THAT LESS THAN A MONTH AGO.
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD. THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT.
I BOUGHT THE RING. I'M READY. I LOVE YOU. SAM.
do YOU KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE?
you ARE GONNA GET A SECOND SHOT AT YOUR ONE TRUE LOVE.
seems LIKE YOU'VE HAD A LOT ON YOUR MIND LATELY.
Yeah. I MEAN, THERE'S JUST A LOT OF STUFF THAT DOESN'T FIT
shoulder PAIN, THE WEIRD, VIOLENT MEMORIES.
you KNOW, I'M GONNA DO WHAT YOU TOLD ME.
I'm GONNA FIND SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS.
like? - NICOLE.
you KNOW, WHO WOULD KNOW ME BETTER?
that's A GOOD QUESTION.
OK,
I HAVE SILVERWARE, CANDLESTICKS.
what ABOUT THE CHINA?
is IT TOO MIDDLE-AGED?
it's PERFECT. WHY ARE YOU SO NERVOUS?
I'm NOT NERVOUS.
it's JUST BEEN AGES SINCE I'VE THROWN A DINNER PARTY AND
twice THAT LONG SINCE I'VE SEEN MARLA AND JODY.
so, OK, I GUESS I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.
here's A THOUGHT.
you COULD JUST CANCEL OR GO OUT, YOU KNOW, WITHOUT ME.
it's ONE DINNER PARTY.
besides, YOU AND ELI ARE GONNA HAVE A BALL MOCKING ME.
Yeah, FRIDAY NIGHT WITH MOM AND HER HIGH SCHOOL THEATER GEEK FRIENDS.
good TIMES. - YOU INVITED ELI?
well, HE MAKES A LIVING OUT OF TALKING TO STRANGERS.
I WISH YOU WOULD RECONSIDER.
sorry. TOLD YOU. PLANS.
tearing YOUR HAIR OUT WHILE SAM GOES AND VISITS HIS FIANCE IN RALEIGH
does NOT CONSTITUTE PLANS.
actually I'M GOING WITH HIM.
you SAW HIM REMEMBER HIS PARAMEDIC SKILLS.
I MEAN, HIS MEMORY'S COMING BACK,
so NOW HE JUST NEEDS A CRASH COURSE IN JIM CLANCY.
a CRASH COURSE?
look, WHEN I WAS OPENING THE SHOP
Jim AND I USED TO LOVE TAKING ROAD TRIPS.
we'd HIT ALL THE ESTATE SALES, ANTIQUE SHOPS, LISTEN TO MUSIC,
play GAMES, STOP BY OUR FAVORITE RESTAURANTS.
so YOU THINK BY RECREATING ALL OF THAT, IT MIGHT JOG SOMETHING?
look, SAM THINKS HE SHOULD KNOW NICOLE,
so HE'LL WANNA BELIEVE WHATEVER SHE SAYS,
which'll ONLY CONFUSE HIM MORE.
you COULD JUST TELL HIM THE TRUTH.
Yeah, I TRIED THAT ONCE,
and HE LOOKED AT ME LIKE I WAS COMPLETELY NUTS.
I JUST HAVE TO GET HIM TO REMBER JIM, YOU KNOW.
but GENTLY, SO HE DOESN'T GET SCARED AWAY.
Ooh! THE HEATING GUYS ARE COMING FIRST THING TOMORROW.
could YOU SWING BY THE HOUSE AND LET THEM IN FOR ME?
sure. WHAT TIME?
7 A. M. MAYBE I SHOULD JUST CANCEL.
no. I'LL DO IT.
well, THAT'S NICE. THANKS.
Oh, I GET IT.
you're THINKING MAYBE YOU SHOULD SPEND THE NIGHT,
housesit, AND BE THERE IN THE MORNING FOR THE HEATING GUYS.
Yeah, AND I HAVE AN ENGLISH LIT PAPER DUE ON MONDAY,
so I COULD USE THE PEACE AND QUIET.
it WOULD HELP ME OUT.
Ohh! FINE. FINE. ABANDON YOUR OWN MOTHER.
so HOW DID YOU TALK SAM INTO LETTING YOU GO?
well, I HAVEN'T YET.
but TRUST ME.
I HAVE A FOOLPROOF PLAN.
wait, YOU-- YOU BOUGHT A GARAGE FULL OF FURNITURE?
uh, ANTIQUES. I GOT 'EM ONLINE.
now YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE DOWN TO RALEIGH, TOO?
uh, NEW HOPE, ACTUALLY. IT'S ABOUT AN HOUR FROM THERE.
anyway, WITH THE PRICE OF GAS, I JUST THOUGHT
Aw, MELINDA, I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, NICOLE CALLED ME AND LEFT ME A MESSAGE
the DAY BEFORE THE ACCIDENT
saying, YEAH, SHE'D MEET ME IF I WAS SERIOUS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL,
but I MEAN, NOW SHE MUST THINK I GOT COLD FEET.
she WON'T RETURN MY CALLS. SHE'S CHANGED HER CELLPHONE NUMBER.
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW SHE'S GONNA REACT,
and IF YOU'RE THERE.
well, I COULD MAKE MYSELF SCARCE, YOU KNOW,
while YOU GUYS ARE TALKING, IF YOU NEED TO RECONNECT, I MEAN.
Melinda, I JUST OWE HER AN EXPLANATION, RIGHT?
maybe SHE COULD EXPLAIN SOME THINGS FOR ME.
like?
you KNOW, LIKE HOW I GOT ALL THAT MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE.
you KNOW, IF WE DO SHARE THE DRIVING,
could GET THERE EARLY TOMORROW MORNING,
and I COULD JUST USE THE CHANGE OF SCENERY, SO...
you AND ME, A ROAD TRIP?
all RIGHT. WHAT THE HECK, HUH?
why NOT? BUT, UM...
is ALL THAT STUFF IN THE GARAGE GONNA FIT IN MY PICKUP?
probably NOT.
which IS WHY I GOT US A TRUCK.
so YOU'RE COOL IF I JUST STAY FOR DRINKS, RIGHT?
if YOU WANT ME TO BEG, I'LL BEG.
I DOUBT THAT I HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON WITH THESE GIRLS,
and YOU-- YOU CAN TALK TO ANYBODY.
Yeah, BUT USUALLY I GET PAID FOR IT.
well, I REALLY SHOULD GET GOIN'.
traitor.
I GOT IT, OK?
Hi. - WELL, HELLO.
JODE, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME DELIA WAS SEEING SOMEONE.
I'm MARLA, AND THIS IS JODY.
I'm ELI. DELIA AND I ARE JUST FRIENDS. WE'RE NOT DATING.
but HOW 'BOUT YOU TWO LADIES?
Oh, WE'RE NOT DATING.
DEALLY! OH, MY GOD!
look AT YOU! OHH!
I KNOW. HI.
Oh, MY GOD. YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. - LOOK AT US.
I SEE YOU'VE MET ELI.
Yes, WE DID. OH, ELI, WOULD YOU MIND OPENING ONE OF THESE?
sure, MY PLEASURE. - THANK YOU.
and WHO IS THIS?
Ah, THIS IS NED, MY SON.
he's ACTUALLY GOING OUT, BUT HE WANTED TO STAY AND MEET YOU GUYS.
Oh, I WISH YOU COULD MEET MY DAUGHTER CARLY.
you'd LIKE HER.
maybe NEXT TIME.
Oh, GOD. IT'S OFFICIAL.
we ARE NOW OUR PARENTS' AGE WHEN WE WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL.
this CALLS FOR ALCOHOL.
well, IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU. - SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
have FUN. - OK.
Bye. - WOW.
we've GOT 25 YEARS OF CATCHING UP TO DO.
Logan, I ALREADY TEXTED DYLAN.
I CAN'T GO OUT WITH YOU GUYS.
B- BECAUSE I'M HOUSESITTING AND
Logan, HANG ON A SEC.
Hello?
whoever's THERE, MELINDA ISN'T HOME.
and SINCE I CAN'T SEE OR HEAR YOU, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
Logan. - GOTTA CALL YOU BACK.
what ARE YOU GUYS DOIN' HERE?
you COULDN'T COME TO THE PARTY, SO WE BROUGHT THE PARTY TO YOU.
Whoo!
wait. HOW MUCH FURNITURE DID YOU BUY?
an ENTIRE ESTATE SALE.
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW BIG OF A TRUCK WE NEED.
if YOU WANTED SOMETHIN' SMALLER, YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED BEFORE.
no, NO, NO, NO. IT'S FINE.
cause YOU KNOW WHAT? WE MIGHT GO TO OTHER ESTATE SALES,
maybe EVEN THRIFT SHOPS. I MEAN, DOESN'T THAT SOUND LIKE FUN?
Yeah. I MEAN, WE ARE IN KIND OF A HURRY,
I MEAN. WHAT IS THIS STUFF?
just IN CASE WE GET BORED ON THE ROAD.
come ON. WE'LL PUT OUR BAGS IN THE BACK.
Yeah.
Aah!
you OK?
that IS SUCH A LOUD DOOR.
you CAN SEE ME, CAN'T YOU?
you CAN!
thank GOD! WHERE ARE YOU PEOPLE HEADED?
I CALL SHOTGUN.
if YOU WERE IN NICOLE'S SHOES,
you'd WANT AN EXPLANATION, TOO, RIGHT?
my NAME IS FRANK, FRANK WHITAKER.
if YOU'LL JUST TALK TO ME.
not NOW.
why NOT NOW?
she's PROBABLY ANGRY AS HELL THAT I FLAKED ON HER, AGAIN.
well, HOPEFULLY SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.
you OK?
Yeah. JUST STRETCHING.
how 'BOUT SOME MUSIC FOR THE ROAD?
Oh, THIS SONG,
it WAS POPULAR WHEN WE...
I-- SORRY-- MOVED TO GRANDVIEW.
it WAS PLAYING WHEN I FOUND THE VACANT STOREFRONT ON TOWN SQUARE.
Oh, I GET IT.
you LIKE HIM.
what, ARE YOU MARRIED, DIVORCED? WHAT?
look, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
so IF YOU WANNA GET ME OUT OF YOUR HAIR...
uh, YOU KNOW WHAT? I JUST REMBERED
there's A PHONE CALL THAT I HAVE TO MAKE, SO...
Oh, FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD.
Hey, FRANK.
it's MELINDA.
got YOUR VOICE MAIL, BUT IT WAS A LITTLE GARBLED,
so WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?
thank YOU.
I RENTED THIS TRUCK TO HAUL SOME STUFF TO A COIN SHOW.
I'm A NUMISMATIST.
anyway, I WAS FIXING A FLAT ON THE SHOULDER OUTSIDE CHARLOTTE
when THE JACK GAVE AWAY.
man, DID THAT HURT.
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? THE RECEPTION'S A LITTLE ROUGH OUT HERE,
so IF YOU COULD JUST GET TO THE POINT.
OK, THERE'S A 1943 COPPER PENNY
fell INTO A CRACK NEAR THE CARGO DOOR.
it's WORTH A FORTUNE.
I-- I BEEN TRYIN' TO PICK IT UP FOREVER, BUT, HEY, WATCH THIS.
my WIFE COULD USE THE MONEY.
I NEED YOU TO FIND THAT PENNY AND SEND IT TO HER.
june WHITAKER ON ALLENWOOD IN RALEIGH.
she's IN THE BOOK. WILL YOU DO THAT FOR ME?
be HAPPY TO HELP.
Ohh, THANK YOU.
well, IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME.
Ciao.
there WEREN'T ENOUGH GUYS IN DRAMA,
so WE DID SOME GENDER BENDING,
with THAT-- THAT ONE ACT BY THAT FRENCH GUY.
Yes!
thank GOD SOMEBODY HAS A FUNCTIONING MEMORY.
anyway, MARLA WAS PLAYING VALERE, THE MALE LOVER,
and WHEN SHE KISSED DEALLY,
the PLACE WENT NUTS.
Oh, I COULD IMAGINE.
God, MEMORY LANE'S SUCH A DEAD-END STREET.
let's PARTY ALREADY.
Eli, I'M SO GLAD YOU STAYED.
Oh, WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED IT.
Deally, MORE CHAMPAGNE?
no, NO, NO. JUST 2 IS MY LIMIT.
you KNOW, MOTHERHOOD AND ALL.
you NEVER KNOW WHEN.
that's MORE LIKE IT.

no. NO, I DIDN'T.
Hey, WATCH IT.
this WAS PLAYING AT THE WRAP PARTY.
Yeah. THAT WAS THE NIGHT THAT, UH,
excuse ME.
hello.
Yeah. HI, MRS.

who ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE?
your PARTY MUST HAVE GONE VIRAL.
this ISN'T MY PARTY.
Really?

OK, GUYS, PARTY'S OVER. EVERYBODY CAN START CLEANING UP!
and NOBODY IS LEAVING WITHOUT A DESIGNATED DRIVER!
mom, LISTEN.
no, YOU LISTEN TO ME.
you WANNA MAKE SOME EXCUSES, YOU CAN SAVE YOUR BREATH.
now, GET TO WORK. YOU'RE COMIN' HOME WITH ME.
but THIS ISN'T MY-- - NOW!
let ME JUST TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED.
no, I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
you VIOLATED MY TRUST AND MELINDA'S.
I TOLD DYLAN THAT I COULDN'T GO OUT TONIGHT,
because I WAS HOUSESITTING, AND THEN THE NEXT THING,
you LET THEM IN!
they BROUGHT ALCOHOL.
were YOU DRINKING?
no. WILL YOU JUST CHILL FOR A SECOND?
chill?
come BACK HERE, I'M TALKING TO YOU.
please SHUT UP.
Hey! DON'T BE SLAMMING DOORS!
I DIDN'T. - I DID.
stop, OK.
just STOP.
you NEED TO GO TO BED,
and I NEED TO THINK CLEARLY ABOUT YOUR PUNISHMENT.
Delia RAYBURN, THE PARTY ANIMAL?
no WAY.
Hi. - OH, MY GOD.
how ARE YOU?
that WAS QUICK. IS THAT HER?
no, HER ROOMMATE, UH, CHERYL.
uh, NICOLE TOOK OFF 2 DAYS AFTER I NEVER SHOWED UP,
and THEN SHE MADE CHERYL PROMISE SHE'D NEVER TELL ME WHERE SHE WAS.
I'm SORRY.
so IT'S A DEAD END.
not EXACTLY.
Cheryl GAVE ME NICOLE'S NEW NUMBER.
I DIDN'T WANNA DO THIS OVER THE PHONE.
Hey, IT'S ME. LEAVE A MESSAGE. - VOICE MAIL.
Nicole, HI. IT'S SAM.
I'm REALLY SORRY I NEVER EXPLAINED TO YOU
why I DIDN'T SHOW UP, AND I JUST
I HAD THIS ACCIDENT,
and MY LIFE'S BEEN MESSED UP EVER SINCE.
uh, I JUST WOULD REALLY LIKE A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED.
well, I HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU.
Bye.
Hey, YOU'RE NOT GOIN' ANYWHERE UNTIL
Melinda's HEATER GUY, REMEMBER.
well, I WANT YOU HOME RIGHT AFTER SO WE CAN TALK.
whatever.
Oh! HEY.
brightness.

whoa.
that'll WORK.
OK, WHERE'S THE GHOST?
uh, THIS IS ME YOU'RE TALKING TO.
sorry. I'M NOT A MORNING PERSON.
well, IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.
well, I BELIEVE "IT'S" A SHE.
I HEARD HER TALKING AT DINNER LAST NIGHT.
teenager, KIND OF SNARKY.
well, DO YOU THINK NED BROUGHT HOME SOME RANDOM GHOST GIRL?
no. I BELIEVE SHE CAME WITH YOUR FRIENDS,
looking FOR A PARTY.
uh, HELLO?
whoever YOU ARE, I CAN HEAR YOU,
maybe EVEN HELP YOU.
well, IF SHE'S HERE, SHE'S NOT TALKIN'.
Oh, MY GOD.
that SONG THAT PLAYED LAST NIGHT.
she WAS A GIRL THAT WE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH.
I HAD DRAMA CLASS WITH HER.
she LOVED TO PARTY SO...
if IT REALLY IS ANGIE, YOU GOTTA HELP ME GET RID OF HER.
that GIRL WAS NOTHING BUT TROUBLE,
just ALWAYS WASTED, AND IF SHE'S HANGIN' AROUND NED
how'd SHE DIE?
uh, SHE GOT REALLY MESSED UP
on OUR SENIOR WRAP NIGHT, AND, UH,
she DECIDED TO WALK HOME, AND THEN THE NEXT DAY,
we HEARD THAT SHE GOT HIT BY A CAR.
anyway, THAT IS NOT THE ONLY REASON WHY I CALLED YOU.
no, THANKS. MAKES ME PARANOID.
no. I-- I FOUND THIS HERE.
I KNOW MY SON.
and THIS IS NOT LIKE HIM,
and ANGIE THE POTHEAD JUST HAPPENED TO SHOW UP AT MY HOUSE
the NIGHT BEFORE I FIND DRUGS IN IT.
Oh, SURE.
blame ME. YOU SUCK!
kids TODAY.
kids YESTERDAY.
this IS NUTS. YOU ARE A THERAPIST.
ghost OR NO GHOST, HOW
how AM I SUPPOSED TO CONFRONT NED ABOUT THIS?
first OF ALL, I WOULDN'T CONFRONT ANYONE
until I WAS SURE IT WAS HIS.
what? YOU HAD THE BANGER SISTERS OVER HERE LAST NIGHT.
what MAKES YOU THINK THEY DIDN'T BRING THE GHOST AND THE GANJA?
find SOMETHING?
see A PENNY, PICK IT UP.
that's OLD. THAT COULD BE WORTH SOMETHIN'.
Yeah. I HAVE A-- A FRIEND WHO'S A COLLECTOR,
so WHENEVER I FIND ANYTHING, I SEND IT TO HER.
you FOR REAL?
Wow. IT'S A LOT OF STUFF.
it's NICOLE. I SHOULD, UH
Hi. YEAH, THANKS FOR CALLIN' ME BACK.
Nah, I KNOW. I KNOW. I REALLY OWE YOU AN EXPLANATION,
but THIS IS GONNA SOUND COMPLETELY CRAZY.
look, I WAS IN AN ACCIDENT ON MY BIKE-- UH, MOTORCYCLE...
Hey!
put THAT DOWN.
Oh, UH... AND...
anything AT ALL.
sorry. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'll FIND A REALLY NICE PLACE FOR YOUR THINGS,
but YOU SHOULD GO INTO THE LIGHT.
light, SCHMIGHT.
I PROMISED MY MOTHER ON HER DEATHBED I'D BE BURIED WITH HER BROOCH,
and MY SISTER-- HEH.
my SENILE SISTER FORGOT.
I'm SORRY ABOUT THAT. UM...
but IF YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN BURIED
my FUNERAL'S TOMORROW, SILLY.
I'm AT CALLAWAY MORTUARY.
open CASKET.
and THAT, UM
the LITTLE TREBLE CLEF.
Yes, THANK YOU, DEAR.
but YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON TRULY WHO CAN HELP ME REMEMBER
Yeah.
OK.
you, TOO.
so HOW DID THAT GO?
she TOLD ME TO HAVE A NICE LIFE.
that's COLD.
I DON'T KNOW. I WOULDN'T BLAME HER.
why SHOULD SHE BELIEVE ME?
I'm SORRY.
well, I SHOULD GET THE TRUCK LOADED.
it's A-- IT'S A LONG DRIVE.
OK. I'M SO SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.
Yeah, IT WAS, UH, GREAT SEEING YOU, TOO. I'LL CALL YOU.
no, I PROMISE. REALLY.
OK. BYE.
Marla AND JODY BOTH SAID NO,
so THAT LEAVES NED-- MY WORST NIGHTMARE.
so IF IT IS NED'S,
any CHANCE ANGIE WOULD HAVE LED YOU TO THAT JOINT ON PURPOSE?
well, IF SHE DID, SHE DID IT TO STIR UP TROUBLE.
that WAS HER SPECIALTY.
she MIGHT JUST BE A NUISANCE GHOST,
or SHE'S STUCK IN SOME JUVENILE DEFIANCE THING
and ACTING OUT THROUGH NED,
or SHE WAS THINKING YOU MAY BE A LITTLE MORE SHALL WE SAY...
simpatico.
where DID YOU GET MY YEARBOOK?
at YOUR HOUSE THIS MORNING.
I've BEEN READING WHAT PEOPLE WROTE TO YOU,
and FROM WHAT I CAN GATHER,
it SOUNDS LIKE ANGIE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO LIKED TO PAR-TAY.
Yeah. WELL, ONE OF US GREW OUT OF IT.
and THE OTHER ONE DIED.
all THE MORE REASON
I DON'T WANT NED TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES THAT I DID.
then YOU NEED TO HAVE A SIT-DOWN,
get HIM TO OPEN UP ABOUT IT.
easier SAID.
Delia, IF YOU GET INVOLVED WITH THIS NOW,
you CAN NIP IT IN THE BUD.
so TO SPEAK.
why WOULD I LIE ABOUT AMNESIA?
I MEAN, WHO EVEN GETS AMNESIA?
it HAPPENS OBVIOUSLY.
here I AM GOIN' ON ABOUT THINGS
when YOU'RE TRYIN' TO PAY RESPECTS TO YOUR MOTHER'S FRIEND AND
no, IT'S OK. I HARDLY KNOW...
um, MY MOM JUST TOLD ME THAT SHE DIED AND ASKED ME TO STOP BY, SO...
you DIDN'T KNOW HER VERY WELL?
wh-why DO YOU KEEP DOIN' THESE RANDOM NICE LITTLE THINGS FOR PEOPLE?
I MEAN LIKE THIS, AND YOU MAILED THAT PENNY
karma.
you KNOW, DO UNTO OTHERS, THAT WHOLE THING.
Oh, YEAH? WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN MY SHOES?
Oh, THAT'S
that's HARD TO SAY.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
I THINK IF YOU LEFT SOMEBODY HANGING,
you'd WANNA GO SEE THEM FACE TO FACE, WOULDN'T YOU?
so THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
OK. OK, BUT
but FIRST, I'M STARVING,
and I KNOW THIS GREAT PLACE NEAR HERE.
do YOU-- DO YOU LIKE MEXICAN?
I DON'T REMEMBER.
something TELLS ME YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.
so, UM, JUST-- JUST WAIT FOR ME IN THE TRUCK, AND
Yeah.
they DID A LOVELY JOB, DIDN'T THEY?
except FOR THAT HAIR.
Heh. HERE YOU GO.
do YOU SEE A LIGHT?
I DO NOW. BLESS YOU.
...and ANTOS CONTROLS IT, READY TO SKATE.
MARENKA DUMPS IT INTO THE BOSTON UNIVERSITY ZONE.
is EVERYTHING OK?
heating's FIXED. FINISHED MY PAPER.
no PARTIES.
great.
so LET'S TALK.
figured.
look, THOSE KIDS JUST SHOWED UP, I SWEAR,
and THE NEXT THING I KNEW, IT WAS OUT OF CONTROL.
OK. I BELIEVE YOU ABOUT THAT.
what DOES THAT MEAN?
look,
you KNOW YOU CAN TALK TO ME ABOUT ANYTHING, RIGHT?
for EXAMPLE,
if YOU'RE INTO ANY KIND OF DRUGS, YOU CAN TELL ME.
what? I'M NOT DOING DRUGS.
I KNOW. HYPOTHETICALLY, IF YOU WERE,
you COULD COME AND TALK TO ME.
after THE WAY YOU ACTED LAST NIGHT?
hypothetically, PROBABLY NOT.
I WAS ANGRY.
obviously YOU STILL ARE.
Yes. SOMETIMES PEOPLE MAKE BAD CHOICES JUST SO THEY CAN FIT IN,
and IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE GETTIN' HIGH OR SMOKIN' POT,
you NEED TO TELL ME ABOUT THAT.
I'm NOT SMOKING ANYTHING.
Really? THEN WHY DID I FIND A JOINT IN YOUR ROOM?
it's SO AFTER-SCHOOL SPECIAL.
are YOU KIDDING ME?
maybe ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS BROUGHT IT.
well, THEY DIDN'T.
if YOU WOULD JUST BE HONEST
I AM. IT WASN'T ME.
so I AM HUNGRY. ARE YOU HUNGRY?
Yeah. YEAH, I AM HUNGRY. I'M HUNGRY.
you've BEEN HERE BEFORE, RIGHT?
several TIMES.
with JIM, HUH?
sorry. I KEEP DOIN' THAT.
no,
it's FINE.
look, I KNOW THAT JIM WOULD WANT ME TO BE HAPPY,
and I WILL BE,
so IN HIS HONOR, I JUST KEEP MOVING FORWARD.
hmm. ALL RIGHT.
great.
world's GREATEST MOLE SAUCE.
Oh, YEAH? - YEAH.
OK. TRY IT.
all RIGHT. OH, WOW.
you're RIGHT. THAT IS REALLY-- THAT'S...
wait A MINUTE. I'VE
I've HAD THIS BEFORE. I'VE TASTED THIS BEFORE MORE THAN ONCE.
I- I'M GUESSING THAT YOU HAVE.
are YOU OK?
Yeah. IT'S JUST MAYBE A KIND OF A SENSORY OVERLOAD.
you KNOW, THE MUSIC, THE FOOD.
Melinda, I'VE-- I'VE BEEN HERE.
Really?
Yeah.
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK THAT-- YOU THINK YOU AND I...
yes?
might HAVE BEEN HERE AT THE SAME TIME?
you KNOW, LIKE, UH,
me AND NICOLE AND-- AND YOU AND JIM SITTIN' AT
I MEAN, THAT'D BE A WEIRD THING, HUH?
I MEAN, WHAT A SMALL WORLD.
Wh-what's WRONG?
Oh, NO. I'VE GOTTA BE ALLERGIC TO THIS.
excuse ME. SORRY.
excuse ME, DOES ANYONE HAVE ANTIHISTAMINES?
message: PRTY 2-NITE!!
mom.
Hello?
gone TO THAT BIG JOINT IN THE SKY! GRAHAH
Yeah. HEY, DELIA, IT'S MARLA.
look, ABOUT YOUR CALL EARLIER...
I DON'T-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
?? - OH.
Ooh. OOH. OH. UM, EXCUSE ME.
your NAME IS-- YOUR NAME IS CAL, RIGHT?
do I KNOW YOU? - NO.
no, I-- I HAVE A-- A MESSAGE FOR YOU FROM DRINA.
what ABOUT DRINA?
who IS THIS?
she SAYS
what?
uh,
what?
did SHE JUST...
who DOES SHE THINK SHE IS?
you're SAYING MY GIRLFRIEND LOOKS LIKE A HOOKER?
Oh. OH, NO. UM...
uh, DRINA
DRINA'S BEEN DEAD FOR 2 YEARS.
who THE HELL ARE YOU?
Hey, HEY, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
there's GOTTA BE A MISUNDERSTANDING, RIGHT?
Oh, YEAH. LET ME CLEAR IT UP.
Hey, YOU KNOW, THERE REALLY HAS BEEN A MISUNDERSTANDING.
Hey, ARE YOU OK?
Hey.
Sam. HEY, ARE YOU OK?
Yeah. YOU KNOW, A COUPLE STITCHES, A TETANUS SHOT,
but, UM, YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY.
like, SPEAKING OF WHICH, WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE?
well, LET'S JUST SAY I WON'T BE USING MY HIGH SCHOOL SPANISH AGAIN.
Yeah. - HI.
do YOU SMELL THAT?
what?
disinfectant?
no, IT JUST...
seems FAMILIAR.
try TO OPEN YOUR EYES IF YOU CAN.
uh, SORRY.
I JUST GOT A LITTLE LIGHTHEADED THERE.
does YOUR SHOULDER HURT?
Yeah, LIKE HELL.
I JUST HAD THE WEIRDEST MEMORY.
what? WHAT DID YOU REMEMBER?
something THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
look, THIS IS GONNA SOUND NUTS, BUT I THINK I REMEMBER
getting SHOT.
Hey. DINNER'S ALMOST
where YOU GOING?
out.
that CRACKING SOUND YOU HEAR IS THE ICE YOU'RE STANDING ON.
relax. IT'S JUST A PARTY.
are YOU FORGETTING WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?
how COULD I? AM I GROUNDED?
you're THIS CLOSE.
what IS GOIN' ON, NED?
why DON'T YOU JUST TALK TO ME?
you WANNA TALK?
fine.
let's TALK ABOUT THIS.
Yeah. HEY, DELIA, IT'S MARLA.
look, ABOUT YOUR CALL EARLIER, I'M PRETTY EMBARRASSED.
I WAS WITH MY DAUGHTER, SO I SORT OF TOLD A LITTLE FIB.
anyway, YEAH, THE JOINT'S MINE. I'M SORRY. JUST...
you're MAD AT ME ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT
when THE WHOLE TIME YOU WERE HERE GETTING HIGH WITH YOUR FRIENDS.
no, I WASN'T, AND I-I'M SORRY THAT I ACCUSED YOU, BUT
mom, YOUR FRIEND ANGIE'S HERE, TOO.
she SHOWED ME YOUR YEARBOOK,
so I DON'T THINK YOU WANNA BE LECTURING ME ABOUT ANYTHING.
Ned, ANGIE WAS ALWAYS A TROUBLEMAKER,
and SHE STILL IS, AND FOR SOME REASON,
she IS TRYING TO GET BETWEEN THE TWO OF US.
your FRIENDS CALLED YOU DOOBIE-AH.
Hey, THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME.
so YOU'RE SAYING YOU DID.
no. I AM SAYING
now WHO'S NOT BEING HONEST?
now WHO'S GROUNDED?
why DON'T YOU JUST GO INTO YOUR ROOM
until WE CAN HAVE A RATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS.
sounds LIKE NEVER TO ME.
I KNOW IT MUST BE PAINFUL, BUT IT'S...
a GOOD SIGN YOU'RE REMBERING.
Yeah, BUT REMEMBERING WHAT?
everything MY FAMILY TELLS ME, NONE OF THIS FITS
the EMERGENCY MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE,
the TASTE OF FOOD I'M ALLERGIC TO,
getting SHOT.
Melinda, I FEEL LIKE I'M LOSING MY MIND.
or MAYBE YOU'RE FINDING IT.
I- IT'S POSSIBLE.
maybe YOU'RE TRYING TO REMEMBER THE WRONG LIFE.
what DO YOU MEAN?
well, YOU HAVE THIS IDEA OF WHO YOU ARE
based ON WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TOLD YOU,
so THAT'S THE SAM THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET BACK TO,
but-- BUT MAYBE JUST...
maybe THERE'S THIS
this WHOLE OTHER PERSON INSIDE YOU ENTIRELY.
wait A MINUTE. ELI TALKED ABOUT SOME KIND OF REGRESSION BACK TO A PAST LIFE.
is THAT WHAT YOU MEAN?
maybe.
if YOU JUST OPEN YOUR MIND...
and YOUR HEART, MAYBE YOU'LL FIND THE KEY.
you MEAN A KEY LIKE A PLACE...
or A PERSON.
sure.
someone WHO'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR ME,
someone WHO KNEW ME BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE.
that's RIGHT.
it's GOTTA BE NICOLE.
Nicole, HI. IT'S SAM.
look, I'M SORRY I KEEP LEAVING YOU THESE MESSAGES,
but I MEAN, EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE ACCIDENT AND MY MEMORY,
please, IT'S ALL TRUE.
and I WAS HOPING MAYBE YOU WOULD HELP ME...
no, IT'S TOO MUCH OF A BURDEN TO PUT ON YOU TO ASK YOU TO
help ME WITH ALL THAT AFTER WHAT I PUT YOU THROUGH, SO...
if YOU NEED TO MOVE ON, MAYBE
maybe THAT'S BETTER FOR BOTH OF US.
be WELL.
you're NOT ANSWERING YOUR PHONE.
I LEFT MY CELL IN THE CAR. SORRY.
did YOU TALK TO NED?
more LIKE YELLED WITH.
so YOU GOT ANGRY.
I KNOW. I KNOW. WE BOTH DID, AND THEN HE BUSTED ME.
and THANKS TO MARLA AND JODY, ALL OF MY CREDIBILITY IS GONE.
parents DON'T HAVE CREDIBILITY.
Oh. HI, ANGIE. I'M ELI.
Yeah, THE SHRINK. I KNOW.
nice TO MEET YOU, TOO.
your PARENTS TRIED COUNSELING?
Yeah. LOOK HOW WELL THAT TURNED OUT.
now DELIA'S JUST LIKE THEM.
she SAYS YOU'RE ACTING LIKE HER PARENTS.
why DOES SHE CARE?
because YOU USED TO BE SO COOL.
she's HANGIN' AROUND BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE COOL,
but NOW SHE THINKS YOU'RE A HYPOCRITE.
Yes. I LIED TO MY SON,
because I'M OLD ENOUGH NOW TO WANT TO PROTECT HIM,
and IF THAT MEANS I'M A HARD-ASS, THEN THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GONNA BE.
you're JUST AN ASS.
Oh, THAT WAS ANGIE. IT WASN'T ME.
she SAYS SHE THINKS
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK, ANGIE. I REALLY DON'T.
I JUST WANNA PROTECT MY SON FROM EVER ENDING UP LIKE YOU.
well, YOU CAN SERIOUSLY GO...
what?
Mmm.
well, LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S GONNA MISS THE PARTY OF THE CENTURY.
can't. GROUNDED.
you're GONNA LET THAT STOP YOU?
come ON, MAN. YOUR MOM'S NOT EVEN HOME.
Hey, ANGIE?
come ON. LIFE'S SHORT.
trust ME ON THAT.
welcome TO NORTH CAROLINA
Hey, IS THIS MUSIC TOO LOUD FOR YOU?
blondie?
well, AT LEAST HE'S GOT GOOD TASTE.
Yeah, I'M NOT SO SURE IT'S HIS.
honey, I'M COMIN' IN.
what KIND OF PARTY IS UNDER A BRIDGE?
I THINK IT'S THE NEXT BLOCK UP.
you MEAN THAT PLACE WITH ALL THE COP CARS?
Oh, MY GOD.
excuse ME. I AM LOOKING FOR MY SON, NED BANKS.
sorry, MA'AM. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME DOWN TO THE PRECINCT.
are YOU ARRESTING EVERYONE?
Yes, MA'AM. DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.
where THE HELL IS HE?
he WENT HOME. WUSS.
he WENT HOME.
what?
I BROUGHT TRIVIA CARDS JUST TO HELP PASS THE TIME.
trivia? WITH ME?
Oh. HEH HEH HEH. RIGHT.
bad IDEA. SORRY.
I HOPE I DID THE RIGHT THING HERE.
the IMPORTANT THING IS YOU TRIED.
well, WITH YOUR HELP.
thank YOU.
you DO THAT, YOU KNOW,
not JUST WITH ME.
Yeah, RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS.
right.
I GOTTA SAY YOU'RE KIND OF AMAZING.
I MEAN, YOU'RE A LITTLE STRANGE, TOO.
Heh. SO ARE YOU.
amazing. HEH HEH.
right. -AMAZING. NOT-- NOT STRANGE.
would IT BE WRONG OF ME TO WANT TO...
run INTO A LITTLE TRAFFIC HERE?
why WOULD YOU WANT THAT?
make THE TRIP LAST A LITTLE BIT LONGER.
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH TROUBLE YOU'RE IN?
no, BUT I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT.
OK, LET'S ALL TRY TO
first OF ALL, YOU'RE GROUNDED.
second OF ALL, YOU'RE GROUNDED.
was IT REALLY WORTH IT JUST RISKING YOUR LIFE FOR SOME PARTY?
that's A LITTLE DRAMATIC, DON'T YOU THINK?
I DIDN'T REALLY RISK MY LIFE.
guys, IF YOU'LL JUST LET ME
when WE GOT THERE,
the POLICE WERE ARRESTING ALMOST ALL OF THOSE KIDS,
and 2 OF THEM WERE TAKEN AWAY IN AN AMBULANCE.
I LEFT BEFORE THEY GOT THERE.
you WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
Yeah, AT LEAST HE'S STILL ALIVE,
and I WOULD BE, TOO, IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY PARENTS.
I TOLD YOU, NED-- - WAIT.
Angie's HERE.
you KNOW WHAT? I HAVE HAD IT WITH HER.
actually, I THINK YOU MAY WANNA HEAR THIS.
Angie, WHAT DID YOU MEAN ABOUT BEING DEAD BECAUSE OF YOUR PARENTS?
I WASN'T WALKING BACK HOME THE NIGHT I WAS KILLED.
I WAS WALKING BACK TO THE PARTY
to BE WITH MY FRIENDS.
it's THE ONLY PLACE I FELT SAFE.
you WERE WALKING BACK TO THE PARTY.
Yes,
because BY THE TIME I'D GOTTEN HOME,
I WAS 5 MINUTES LATE, 5 STINKING MINUTES LATE,
and MY DAD LOCKED ME OUT OF THE HOUSE.
so I STARTED WALKING BACK TO THE PARTY,
and I WAS CRYING SO HARD...
I DIDN'T EVEN HEAR THAT CAR.
what IS IT? WHAT'S GOING ON?
she SAYS HER PARENTS LOCKED HER OUT OF THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT,
because SHE MISSED HER CURFEW BY 5 MINUTES.
they WERE THAT STRICT.
that's HORRIBLE.
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO NED.
she SAYS YOU ALREADY HAVE,
locked HIM OUT,
because YOU'RE LYING TO HIM.
and SHE WANTS TO KNOW
how's HE EVER GONNA LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES - IF YOU'RE NOT BEING HONEST WITH HIM? - THAT'S NOT
OK.
you're RIGHT.
but YOU KNOW,
what HAPPENED TO YOU,
I LEARNED SUCH A HUGE LESSON.
what I MEAN IS
a LOT OF THIS IS BECAUSE OF YOU.
when JODY CALLED ME THAT MORNING TO TELL ME THAT YOU WERE DEAD,
my WHOLE LIFE WAS COMPLETELY CHANGED.
and WHEN I FINALLY STOPPED CRYING,
I VOWED THAT I WOULD NEVER
let ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN TO SOMEBODY I CARED ABOUT.
so I GUESS...
I WOULDN'T BE THE MOM I AM
if I HADN'T KNOWN YOU.
and I WOULDN'T HAVE A SON LIKE NED.
if MY PARENTS TALKED TO ME LIKE THAT...
it's NEVER TOO LATE,
even NOW. YOU CAN TALK TO THEM.
that's GENIUS, EINSTEIN.
I'm DEAD.
that's WHAT I'M HERE FOR.
I ALREADY CALLED THEM.
just SO YOU KNOW,
when I GOT TO THAT PARTY, I SAW HOW CRAZY IT WAS,
so I TURNED AROUND AND CAME HOME.
I'm PROUD OF YOU, NED.
I'm NOT SURE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.
and I'M SORRY FOR THE WAY I ACTED.
good.
me, TOO.
the TRUTH IS I'M ALWAYS GONNA WORRY ABOUT YOU.
and THE DRUGS AND THE DRINKING, I KNOW THEY'RE ALL AROUND,
and IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T TRUST YOUR JUDGMENT.
it's JUST WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR JUDGMENT
the SECOND YOU'RE DRUNK OR GETTING HIGH.
mom, I KNOW.
I'm SORRY YOU LOST YOUR FRIEND.
me, TOO.
thank YOU.
I GUESS THERE'S NOTHIN' LIKE A ROAD TRIP
to HELP YOU FORGET YOUR PAST.
I MEAN MY PAST, NOT YOUR PAST. I'M SURE YOURS IS FINE.
no, I NEED TO MOVE FORWARD, TOO.
that's GOOD TO HEAR.
Hey, UH, LOOK,
I KNOW WE JUST GOT HERE. UM...
but, UM, YOU WANNA GO DOWN TO THE VILLAGE?
I DON'T KNOW. WE COULD GO TO A RESTAURANT OR, UM...
hit A BOOKSTORE. THE ONLY BOOKSTORE.
uh, OR WE COULD JUST, YOU KNOW, GET A MOVIE
and THEN HAVE TAKEOUT, COME BACK HERE, AND...
we COULD, UH...
go TO A HARDWARE STORE A- AND GET SOME SPACKLE AND THEN...
SPACKLE?
you KNOW, I THINK I'VE FORGOTTEN HOW TO DO THIS ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE.
do WHAT?
ask SOMEBODY OUT.
Oh.
is THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
Yeah.
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE, AND-- AND THEN I SPOKE TO CHERYL.
I'm SO SORRY.
uh...
Oh, MY GOD. IT'S TRUE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM, DO YOU?
I'm SORRY.
you MUST BE NICOLE.
Nikki. IT'S NIKKI.
my mom says nobody lived here since old man Richmond moved out.
I don't think it's necessarily haunted.
go there to have a look.
you go.
you go!
I'll go.
what's the matter? Are you afraid?
am not.
come with me.
Melinda,what are you doing here?
it's so late.
you three should be in bed.
we're looking for ghosts.
I can't see them anymore.
sometimes that happens.
you grow out of it.
can you?
Nope. i don't see any.
you can't see ghosts.
you only hear or feel them.
right.
I did not know that.
what's that?
is something in there?
well done, homer.
the kids will be disappointed if they are not frightened.
go get it!
I don't get it.
why does a ghost dog need to go for a walk?
if i could answer that, i could cross him over.
poor homer.
he's probably just waiting for the ghost kids from the orphanage to come back and get him.
Thanks.
as if i don't feel bad enough that he got left behind.
here's what i think.
if we take the ball and we throw it far enough, he will keep going until he goes into the light, right?
what was that?
the kids.
what are you doing?
hang on a second.
that is private property, right?
mine. I just rented the place.
don't you have keys?
lost 'em.
I'm sorry about the noise.
I tried every door, but...
this is my wife Melinda.
nice to meet you guys.
so you're moving in now?
I've been real busy and i don't have much stuff,so...
you need a hand?
no. no.
no.
OK, then.
if you need anything, we're right across the street.
welcome to the neighborhood.
you lose your keys, you call a locksmith.
and who moves in in the middle of the night?
probably somebody who had to move out of their last place in the mile of the night.
I don't know.
I think that guy was weird.
maybe it'll be a short-term rental.
I kind of miss cranky old Mr. Richmond.
maybe he'll come out of retirement and move back.
what?
he's growling.
he can't bite me, can he?
something scared him.
a ghost dog catcher?
Todd was not the only one moving in at night.
anything?
no, just todd.
maybe he likes to sleep in?
very funny.
it's also an angry ghost.
how can you tell?
I can feel it and see it in the way he acted.
great.
for our new neighbors, we have the cast of in cold blood.
I should go talk to todd.
make sure he understands what's going on.
you know,i wouldn't.
why not?
you never know how people are gonna react when you tell them what you do.
I always seem to handle it.
because most of the time you can walk away, right?
and so can the people you help.
But,i mean,this guy lives right across the street.
what if he's got a big mouth,you know?
and starts telling everybody.
you're gonna have to see him every day.
you can't avoid him.
maybe you're right.
it's rare,but it happens.
I am going to have to have a word with the departed,though.
Morning,neighbor.
I hope i didn't wake you.
I don't sleep much.
what do you want?
I just wanted to make sure we didn't get off on the wrong foot last night and thought maybe you'd like a home-cooked breakfast.
Thanks.
look, i'd invite you in,but...
that's so nice, but i can only stay for a minute.
I have always wanted to see the inside of this place ever since we moved here.
not much to see.
you travel light?
move around a lot.
Really?
where are you from?
Look,...
those are gorgeous fixtures.
really...
original?
sure, i guess.
am i keeping you from work?
I got to buy some things for the house.
what do you do for a living?
Internet.
website designer.
listen, i appreciate the breakfast.
I do,but...
I like my privacy.
you understand?
you see me?
stay away.
what?
sorry.
sorry,I was,...
great moldings on that door.
look...
I really appreciate the breakfast,but...
I really have to go.
I understand, Sorry.
I own an antique store...
most earthbound spirits are excited to know there's someone there they can talk to and that can see them.
not this guy.
maybe this one wants to be left alone.
no.
this ghost is on a mission.
he walks with purpose.
he's evasive, like he's up to something.
there he is.
he who?
Todd or the ghost?
both.
OK, what are you doing?
I'm gonna follow them.
Melinda, stop.
don't get involved in this.
I'm already involved in this.
there's a ghost living across the street.
you can pretend he's not there.
I can't.
then i'm going with you.
no, you have work to do, and so do i.
OK?
I'm gonna try and get the ghost alone and see if i can't help him move on.
watch out.
are you all right?
why are you following me?
I'm not.
I wasn't.
never met a ghost who's so proactive before.
Melinda, this one hurt you.
it wasn't like that.
he definitely wants to hurt todd, though.
like "dead" hurt.
how is that even possible?
I thought spirits couldn't touch anything real, like a living person.
it's always been that way with earthbounds.
usually, they move things.
it's like they're learning how to interact more, make a bigger impact on this world.
speaking of crossing over, i have been doing some research into man's best friend.
this guy is the best dog trainer in the world, and he says that all dogs have issues.
what kind of issues could homer have that would keep him here?
tons.
phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorders.
or he's just a dog who doesn't know he's supposed to walk into the light.
maybe he thinks the light is a car coming at him.
there's something in here about that.
you keep me posted on that.
what's he doing?
getting ready for a hurricane?
trying to lower property values.
I can't decide.
what?
we have to get him off that ladder.
OK.
it looks like you need up there.
I'm fine.
can i talk to you for a minute?
it's important.
why don't you people just leave me alone?
I want privacy.
don't you get that?
we get it.
stop it.
Todd, can you hear me?
is he ok?
no, Call 911.
let him die.
Why?
what is your problem?
keep breathing, you'll be ok.
is Melinda ok?
Why?
wanted to make sure she didn't get hit in the head,too.
what are you talking about?
he killed my granddaughter.
he's going to get what he deserves.
and if you don't stay out of my way,you will,too.
you ok?
I don't know.
this ghost really wants to kill him.
he thinks that Todd murdered his granddaughter.
Wait,...
he's a killer?
I don't know for sure.
do ghosts lie?
they can make mistakes.
that's it.
you're staying away from this guy.
I'm calling the cops.
and tell them what?
I don't need your help.
no. I can get them to check up on him.
Clark'll do that for me.
please let me handle this. ok?
don't do anything until i can get the whole story.
he's home.
the son of a bitch lived, and he's home again.
it took everything i had to do that to him.
now i'm too weak.
it's a vicious circle.
you thrive on his energy, but when he's weakened,so are you.
whose locket?
my granddaughter's.
I gave it to her for her tenth birthday.
what's the inscription say?
patience.
they buried me with it.
they should've buried her with it, but they never found her body.
what's your name?
what the hell do you care what my name is?
my granddaughter's dead, and that bastard killed her, and he got away with it.
why do you think he killed her?
I know.
should've never sent her away.
I didn't know what else to do.
sent her away where?
boarding school.
she needed the discipline.
and that's where she met him.
he was older.
he had no business be friending her.
they called me, they told me she was missing.
they had everybody out there looking for any sign of her.
that's the first time i ever laid eyes on Todd Daria.
over here.
found something.
that's all they ever found of her.
the cops knew he killed her.
why isn't he in jail?
in jail?
they never even made an arrest.
no body.
no evidence.
they could never put a case together.
but my heart was broken.
I should've killed him while i was still alive, but i promise you, i promise you, i will find the strength to make him pay.
wait.
this is just too weird, Mel.
I don't want you near this guy.
this ghost is actively trying to kill him.
I can't turn away.
you know what it's like to have a ghost attached to you.
he isn't an innocent bystander.
he might be a murderer.
I know what i'm dealing with.
you're overreacting.
and you're underreacting.
people are getting hurt.
I know, and that's not gonna stop unless i do something.
no,not if it means you're gonna go up close and personal with Todd the ripper.
I'm sorry, Mel, i can't let you do this.
can't let me?
come on, you know what i mean.
I know what you mean.
it's just too dangerous.
I heard it the first time you said it.
I'm gonna go to bed now, if you'll let me,that is.
no,don't go making me the bad guy because i care about you.
don't get all noble.
there's a difference between caring and controlling.
wait, you know i don't do that.
good night.
all right, fine.
good night.
that's what i said.
I love you, too.
is that her?
missing for 8 years.
don't you think you should call the police?
and tell them what, that a ghost told me he's guilty?
Melinda,you saw the guy bury plastic bags.
it'd be stupid to bury evidence in your backyard, wouldn't it?
we can test his IQ after we call the police.
let me get rid of this ghost, ok?
then i'll check in with the police.
you have anything yet on homer the dog?
you know,i'm getting close,actually.
this book says dogs are into their pack leaders, and in this case, i think you have become homer's pack leader.
and i have to cross over, then he'll follow me?
I said i was close.
I didn't say i had it.
OK, according to the book, dogs are very migratory.
they like to go to new places, try new things, travel, shopping.
wait, that's me.
it's him. - Who? Homer?
my next-door neighbor.
keep an eye on him.
the minute he gets back in his truck, call me on my cell.
Why?
where are you going?
get out of there.
how long ago did he leave?
I don't know.
I'm swamped, i was ringing up customers, and when i looked, his truck was gone.
OK. thanks
you just can't mind your own business, can you?
it was my dog homer.
I thought his ball had rolled in here, but i don't see it anywhere, so...
I'll help you look for it.
what's the matter?
are you scared?
just like everybody else.
I... i should go.
please, just let me go.
do what i say, and everything'll be ok.
why are you doing this?
because i'm haunted.
there's something in here with us right now.
you hear that?
he thinks i'm something.
he doesn't know who i am.
now that you're here, you can tell him.
no.
you shouldn't have come in here.
I can only protect myself.
I can't protect you.
is that what all this is for, protection?
to ward off evil.
keep the ghosts away.
talismans and offerings.
I keep 'em buried in the yard so the spirits don't seep up from below, but if they do, the incense confuses 'em.
none of this will work.
I will work. I've gotta keep trying.
new things, different things.
combinations.
something's gonna work.
tell him why i'm here.
stop it.
I can't...
tell him why he's being haunted.
tell him why he's being haunted!
tell him!
you're being haunted because of Stacy.
how do you know about Stacy?
you tell him you know he killed her.
I want you out of here.
get off my property and leave me alone.
he's a murderer.
maybe he'll kill you next.
get away from me!
he's going to die.
sooner or later, i'll get the strength, i'll find a way.
you can't save him.
if he dies, you may never find out what happened to Stacy.
I know what happened.
he murdered her.
but you don't know how.
you don't know why.
you don't know where she is,
you don't where he left her.
those are the things that are keeping you here.
those are the things you need to find out to get closure.
he'll never admit to it.
let me help you.
please, tell me your name.
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you!
going to get you.
that's enough.
that's enough.
all right?
somebody lives here.
go find something else to do.
OK, come on guys.
and you...
Todd, it's Melinda again.
if i could just talk to you for 2 minutes.
look, i...
I know you're being haunted.
I believe you.
you're not crazy.
I know about these things.
and i know it's been happening to you.
I spoke to the person who's haunting you.
his name is Lyle chase.
he wants to know about Stacy and he thinks that you know.
I can help you.
if you'll let me.
but he's not gonna leave you alone until you tell him what happened.
Hello?
do you know the origin of the term graveyard shift?
I thought you weren't speaking to me.
back in England in the 1500s, i think, they...
discovered that they'd been burying people sometimes that they only thought were dead.
so they started burying them with a little string tied around their wrist that...
led up through the ground, you know, to a bell...
that sat in the grass by their grave.
and then someone from the village had to stay up all night waiting for a bell to ring.
graveyard shift.
dead ringer.
this is the kind of tidbit you're gonna miss if you stay mad at me.
you were mad at me.
still am.
a little.
Mel, i can't stand it when things aren't right with us.
I don't like it when you treat me like i'm a child.
I don't.
OK.
but look, are you gonna honestly tell me that i shouldn't feel worried about what's happening here?
you're gonna tell me that you feel safe?
I have to do what i have to do.
and sometimes, that's not totally safe.
I mean, there's your job, but i don't tell you that i can't let you do it.
I love you.
and when i think about losing you, i can't...
you have to love what i do.
he's getting ready to go somewhere.
I have to go.
go where?
do you trust me?
Yes.
I have to go.
listen for the bells.
watch for the dead ringers.
I need you to back off.
I don't wanna let that bastard out of my sight.
I can't connect with him with you in his face.
he can't focus.
I need to do this alone.
you will have your time to talk to him through me.
but not until i've talked to him first.
she's alive.
what are you doing here?
please, can we just talk?
Todd, who is she?
she's a nosy neighbor from across the street.
but she knows.
what do you mean, she knows?
knows what?
she says your grandfather is haunting me.
Lyle's the one who's been doing all of this.
my dead grandfather.
he's still here.
and he's attached to Todd.
you don't know what it's been like.
she says that Lyle thinks that i killed you.
and you believe her.
your grandfather just wants to know what happened to you.
we have to tell him.
don't say anything else, Todd.
just chill out!
Stacy, he's not gonna leave me alone.
this man is trying to kill me.
your grandfather, he loves you...
he loves me.
did he love me when he sent me to that place?
I can help you talk to him.
he searched for you. He was heartbroken.
you must be talking about some other Lyle chase.
look, i didn't want to talk to him when he was alive.
I sure as hell don't wanna talk to him now.
Stacy, please.
I'm not Stacy anymore.
look, my grandfather is dead.
so did Stacy.
come on, Stacy!
I met Stacy my senior year.
she was one tough little girl.
of course, every other guy tried to hit on her.
but not you.
I'll tell you the truth.
I always thought she was way outta my league.
did she tell you why she decided to live with Lyle?
her mother was a drug addict and they were practically living on the streets.
her grandfather disowned her mother, you know, years before.
and when her mom dead, the old man decided he would take Stacy in.
he wasn't ready for her.
that's why he sent her away to boarding school.
boarding school?
is that what he called it?
wasn't it?
it was...
it was a boot camp for kids.
the shelter harbor school for boys and girls.
it was the kind of place where parents would send their kids to break their spirit.
they come and get you in the middle of the night.
there was this one teacher who really loved his job.
Mr. Papaso.
sadistic bastard, and he wanted to break Stacy in the worst way.
he'd play games with your head and beat you.
thank you, Mr. Papaso, sir!
one more, sir!
on the day she fought back, he...
he told her that she was going into the observation room.
we all knew that that room was run by papaso, and it was just another guaranteed beating.
she knew she'd never make it through 3 more years there.
so she decided to run away.
I just don't want anybody to come looking for her.
so you helped her stage her own murder.
that was the last time i saw her.
that's when you became a suspect?
the suspect.
didn't realize it would be such a big deal.
we were just stupid kids.
we didn't even know if faking your own murder was illegal.
then they started questioning me and...
people were out searching and...
it just got way too big.
no goin' back.
where did she go?
she's good at taking care of herself.
it's all she'd ever done since she was a kid.
you risked going to jail.
you... kept her secret all this time.
you really love her.
doesn't matter.
you know, i really changed for both of us that night.
she had to become somebody else and me, i...
I haven't had a good night's sleep since.
I feel like i'm cursed.
my guts are churning all the time and...
the past 8 years, i haven't lived anywhere longer than 6 months because of Lyle the friendly ghost.
maybe it's me who should be dead.
I want my life back.
he's lying!
he's not, Lyle.
I saw her for myself.
she's alive and well.
I don't believe it.
I wanna see her.
he doesn't believe it.
I know what we did was wrong, all right?
we didn't know what else to do.
I mean, there was...
nobody there for her.
you weren't there for her.
shelter harbor was the only place for her!
she was beaten, lyle.
there was a teacher there that singled her out.
she was abused.
I didn't know that.
he said he didn't know that.
that's bull.
you... you signed the papers, Lyle.
you gave them permission.
all necessary measures.
remember that?
and she tried to tell you, but you didn't care!
you're lying!
you're trying to make this all my fault!
you...
you are the one who killed her!
you...
you were the one who killed her!
stop it!
now, you stop it!
Stacy is alive and she chose to disappear because you wouldn't help her!
that is why you lost your granddaughter, all right?
not because he took her.
I never wanted to hurt her.
please...
you have to bring me to her.
I want to see her.
Stacy made it very clear she doesn't want to talk to you.
you have to bring me to her.
please.
do you know where she is?
she'll kill me.
you'll finally get your life back.
I don't understand.
why would she come back here?
it's completely different now.
see, she saw this as a chance to help kids like her, help make sure they'd feel safe here.
in a sense, she gives back.
go on, you guys.
I'll meet you on the field.
she's all grown up.
you shouldn't have done this.
you promised never to come here.
look, your grandfather is here, all right?
he knows everything that happened, and he feels terrible.
but he can't...
what's the thing?
cross over.
he can't cross over until he talks to you.
what are you doing, Todd?
tell her i have her locket.
your grandfather's telling me that he...
he has your locket, the one that he gave you when you were 10.
you told her about that?
no, i didn't.
what's on the locket?
what?
what's engraved on the locket?
patience.
he's here?
he can hear you.
you never gave me a chance... grandpa.
I just wanted to matter.
you tell her she did matter.
I thought i had to be tough with you so you wouldn't end up like your mother.
he was afraid that you'd end up like your mom.
I wanted you to save her, grandpa!
sweetheart, i tried to save her.
I couldn't.
you don't know.
Stacy, people do things and make choices.
sometimes they have to save themselves...
and sometimes they just can't.
but you did, Stace.
you saved yourself.
I would take it all back if i could.
I would do anything.
but look at her.
she grew up strong and she's so beautiful.
she's the picture of her mother.
he wants you to know that he's sorry.
and he would take it all back if he could.
and he's so proud.
he's really proud of who you are and he thinks you look just like your mother.
I'm so sorry, grandpa.
I should have told you that i was...
OK.
but then... I don't know what I'm doing.
you tell her... that i love her and i didn't know how much until she was gone.
what do you see?
it's so bright.
I could touch it.
that means you're ready.
you can cross over.
it's my daughter...
waiting for me.
he sees your mother.
mom?
she looks so happy.
thank you.
he's gone.
what's this? You just got here.
time to move on.
Why? Lyle's gone.
I got an interesting job offer.
teaching computer to the kids at shelter harbor, so...
I'll have room and board......
and...
what about your secret?
we decided to confront it all and let the chips fall.
I'm really sorry about everything.
you were never a dull neighbor.
good luck.
I can't thank you enough.
seriously, for me, for Stacy, and for lyle.
come here.
maybe you should just keep doing what you're doing
like you do it.
I can... i can adapt.
I can do that.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I love this dog.
I love you!
how are we gonna get you to cross over?
no crossing the dog over.
I like the way he makes you smile.
let's go home.
all right. - Ok.
my mom says nobody lived here since old man Richmond moved out.
I don't think it's necessarily haunted.
go there to have a look.
you go.
you go!
I'll go.
what's the matter? Are you afraid?
am not.
come with me.
Melinda,what are you doing here?
it's so late.
you three should be in bed.
we're looking for ghosts.
I can't see them anymore.
sometimes that happens.
you grow out of it.
can you?
Nope. i don't see any.
you can't see ghosts.
you only hear or feel them.
right.
I did not know that.
what's that?
is something in there?
well done, homer.
the kids will be disappointed if they are not frightened.
go get it!
I don't get it.
why does a ghost dog need to go for a walk?
if i could answer that, i could cross him over.
poor homer.
he's probably just waiting for the ghost kids from the orphanage to come back and get him.
Thanks.
as if i don't feel bad enough that he got left behind.
here's what i think.
if we take the ball and we throw it far enough, he will keep going until he goes into the light, right?
what was that?
the kids.
what are you doing?
hang on a second.
that is private property, right?
mine. I just rented the place.
don't you have keys?
lost 'em.
I'm sorry about the noise.
I tried every door, but...
this is my wife Melinda.
nice to meet you guys.
so you're moving in now?
I've been real busy and i don't have much stuff,so...
you need a hand?
no. no.
no.
OK, then.
if you need anything, we're right across the street.
welcome to the neighborhood.
you lose your keys, you call a locksmith.
and who moves in in the middle of the night?
probably somebody who had to move out of their last place in the mile of the night.
I don't know.
I think that guy was weird.
maybe it'll be a short-term rental.
I kind of miss cranky old Mr. Richmond.
maybe he'll come out of retirement and move back.
what?
he's growling.
he can't bite me, can he?
something scared him.
a ghost dog catcher?
Todd was not the only one moving in at night.
anything?
no, just todd.
maybe he likes to sleep in?
very funny.
it's also an angry ghost.
how can you tell?
I can feel it and see it in the way he acted.
great.
for our new neighbors, we have the cast of in cold blood.
I should go talk to todd.
make sure he understands what's going on.
you know,i wouldn't.
why not?
you never know how people are gonna react when you tell them what you do.
I always seem to handle it.
because most of the time you can walk away, right?
and so can the people you help.
But,i mean,this guy lives right across the street.
what if he's got a big mouth,you know?
and starts telling everybody.
you're gonna have to see him every day.
you can't avoid him.
maybe you're right.
it's rare,but it happens.
I am going to have to have a word with the departed,though.
Morning,neighbor.
I hope i didn't wake you.
I don't sleep much.
what do you want?
I just wanted to make sure we didn't get off on the wrong foot last night and thought maybe you'd like a home-cooked breakfast.
Thanks.
look, i'd invite you in,but...
that's so nice, but i can only stay for a minute.
I have always wanted to see the inside of this place ever since we moved here.
not much to see.
you travel light?
move around a lot.
Really?
where are you from?
Look,...
those are gorgeous fixtures.
really...
original?
sure, i guess.
am i keeping you from work?
I got to buy some things for the house.
what do you do for a living?
Internet.
website designer.
listen, i appreciate the breakfast.
I do,but...
I like my privacy.
you understand?
you see me?
stay away.
what?
sorry.
sorry,I was,...
great moldings on that door.
look...
I really appreciate the breakfast,but...
I really have to go.
I understand, Sorry.
I own an antique store...
most earthbound spirits are excited to know there's someone there they can talk to and that can see them.
not this guy.
maybe this one wants to be left alone.
no.
this ghost is on a mission.
he walks with purpose.
he's evasive, like he's up to something.
there he is.
he who?
Todd or the ghost?
both.
OK, what are you doing?
I'm gonna follow them.
Melinda, stop.
don't get involved in this.
I'm already involved in this.
there's a ghost living across the street.
you can pretend he's not there.
I can't.
then i'm going with you.
no, you have work to do, and so do i.
OK?
I'm gonna try and get the ghost alone and see if i can't help him move on.
watch out.
are you all right?
why are you following me?
I'm not.
I wasn't.
never met a ghost who's so proactive before.
Melinda, this one hurt you.
it wasn't like that.
he definitely wants to hurt todd, though.
like "dead" hurt.
how is that even possible?
I thought spirits couldn't touch anything real, like a living person.
it's always been that way with earthbounds.
usually, they move things.
it's like they're learning how to interact more, make a bigger impact on this world.
speaking of crossing over, i have been doing some research into man's best friend.
this guy is the best dog trainer in the world, and he says that all dogs have issues.
what kind of issues could homer have that would keep him here?
tons.
phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorders.
or he's just a dog who doesn't know he's supposed to walk into the light.
maybe he thinks the light is a car coming at him.
there's something in here about that.
you keep me posted on that.
what's he doing?
getting ready for a hurricane?
trying to lower property values.
I can't decide.
what?
we have to get him off that ladder.
OK.
it looks like you need up there.
I'm fine.
can i talk to you for a minute?
it's important.
why don't you people just leave me alone?
I want privacy.
don't you get that?
we get it.
stop it.
Todd, can you hear me?
is he ok?
no, Call 911.
let him die.
Why?
what is your problem?
keep breathing, you'll be ok.
is Melinda ok?
Why?
wanted to make sure she didn't get hit in the head,too.
what are you talking about?
he killed my granddaughter.
he's going to get what he deserves.
and if you don't stay out of my way,you will,too.
you ok?
I don't know.
this ghost really wants to kill him.
he thinks that Todd murdered his granddaughter.
Wait,...
he's a killer?
I don't know for sure.
do ghosts lie?
they can make mistakes.
that's it.
you're staying away from this guy.
I'm calling the cops.
and tell them what?
I don't need your help.
no. I can get them to check up on him.
Clark'll do that for me.
please let me handle this. ok?
don't do anything until i can get the whole story.
he's home.
the son of a bitch lived, and he's home again.
it took everything i had to do that to him.
now i'm too weak.
it's a vicious circle.
you thrive on his energy, but when he's weakened,so are you.
whose locket?
my granddaughter's.
I gave it to her for her tenth birthday.
what's the inscription say?
patience.
they buried me with it.
they should've buried her with it, but they never found her body.
what's your name?
what the hell do you care what my name is?
my granddaughter's dead, and that bastard killed her, and he got away with it.
why do you think he killed her?
I know.
should've never sent her away.
I didn't know what else to do.
sent her away where?
boarding school.
she needed the discipline.
and that's where she met him.
he was older.
he had no business be friending her.
they called me, they told me she was missing.
they had everybody out there looking for any sign of her.
that's the first time i ever laid eyes on Todd Daria.
over here.
found something.
that's all they ever found of her.
the cops knew he killed her.
why isn't he in jail?
in jail?
they never even made an arrest.
no body.
no evidence.
they could never put a case together.
but my heart was broken.
I should've killed him while i was still alive, but i promise you, i promise you, i will find the strength to make him pay.
wait.
this is just too weird, Mel.
I don't want you near this guy.
this ghost is actively trying to kill him.
I can't turn away.
you know what it's like to have a ghost attached to you.
he isn't an innocent bystander.
he might be a murderer.
I know what i'm dealing with.
you're overreacting.
and you're underreacting.
people are getting hurt.
I know, and that's not gonna stop unless i do something.
no,not if it means you're gonna go up close and personal with Todd the ripper.
I'm sorry, Mel, i can't let you do this.
can't let me?
come on, you know what i mean.
I know what you mean.
it's just too dangerous.
I heard it the first time you said it.
I'm gonna go to bed now, if you'll let me,that is.
no,don't go making me the bad guy because i care about you.
don't get all noble.
there's a difference between caring and controlling.
wait, you know i don't do that.
good night.
all right, fine.
good night.
that's what i said.
I love you, too.
is that her?
missing for 8 years.
don't you think you should call the police?
and tell them what, that a ghost told me he's guilty?
Melinda,you saw the guy bury plastic bags.
it'd be stupid to bury evidence in your backyard, wouldn't it?
we can test his IQ after we call the police.
let me get rid of this ghost, ok?
then i'll check in with the police.
you have anything yet on homer the dog?
you know,i'm getting close,actually.
this book says dogs are into their pack leaders, and in this case, i think you have become homer's pack leader.
and i have to cross over, then he'll follow me?
I said i was close.
I didn't say i had it.
OK, according to the book, dogs are very migratory.
they like to go to new places, try new things, travel, shopping.
wait, that's me.
it's him. - Who? Homer?
my next-door neighbor.
keep an eye on him.
the minute he gets back in his truck, call me on my cell.
Why?
where are you going?
get out of there.
how long ago did he leave?
I don't know.
I'm swamped, i was ringing up customers, and when i looked, his truck was gone.
OK. thanks
you just can't mind your own business, can you?
it was my dog homer.
I thought his ball had rolled in here, but i don't see it anywhere, so...
I'll help you look for it.
what's the matter?
are you scared?
just like everybody else.
I... i should go.
please, just let me go.
do what i say, and everything'll be ok.
why are you doing this?
because i'm haunted.
there's something in here with us right now.
you hear that?
he thinks i'm something.
he doesn't know who i am.
now that you're here, you can tell him.
no.
you shouldn't have come in here.
I can only protect myself.
I can't protect you.
is that what all this is for, protection?
to ward off evil.
keep the ghosts away.
talismans and offerings.
I keep 'em buried in the yard so the spirits don't seep up from below, but if they do, the incense confuses 'em.
none of this will work.
I will work. I've gotta keep trying.
new things, different things.
combinations.
something's gonna work.
tell him why i'm here.
stop it.
I can't...
tell him why he's being haunted.
tell him why he's being haunted!
tell him!
you're being haunted because of Stacy.
how do you know about Stacy?
you tell him you know he killed her.
I want you out of here.
get off my property and leave me alone.
he's a murderer.
maybe he'll kill you next.
get away from me!
he's going to die.
sooner or later, i'll get the strength, i'll find a way.
you can't save him.
if he dies, you may never find out what happened to Stacy.
I know what happened.
he murdered her.
but you don't know how.
you don't know why.
you don't know where she is,
you don't where he left her.
those are the things that are keeping you here.
those are the things you need to find out to get closure.
he'll never admit to it.
let me help you.
please, tell me your name.
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you!
going to get you.
that's enough.
that's enough.
all right?
somebody lives here.
go find something else to do.
OK, come on guys.
and you...
Todd, it's Melinda again.
if i could just talk to you for 2 minutes.
look, i...
I know you're being haunted.
I believe you.
you're not crazy.
I know about these things.
and i know it's been happening to you.
I spoke to the person who's haunting you.
his name is Lyle chase.
he wants to know about Stacy and he thinks that you know.
I can help you.
if you'll let me.
but he's not gonna leave you alone until you tell him what happened.
Hello?
do you know the origin of the term graveyard shift?
I thought you weren't speaking to me.
back in England in the 1500s, i think, they...
discovered that they'd been burying people sometimes that they only thought were dead.
so they started burying them with a little string tied around their wrist that...
led up through the ground, you know, to a bell...
that sat in the grass by their grave.
and then someone from the village had to stay up all night waiting for a bell to ring.
graveyard shift.
dead ringer.
this is the kind of tidbit you're gonna miss if you stay mad at me.
you were mad at me.
still am.
a little.
Mel, i can't stand it when things aren't right with us.
I don't like it when you treat me like i'm a child.
I don't.
OK.
but look, are you gonna honestly tell me that i shouldn't feel worried about what's happening here?
you're gonna tell me that you feel safe?
I have to do what i have to do.
and sometimes, that's not totally safe.
I mean, there's your job, but i don't tell you that i can't let you do it.
I love you.
and when i think about losing you, i can't...
you have to love what i do.
he's getting ready to go somewhere.
I have to go.
go where?
do you trust me?
Yes.
I have to go.
listen for the bells.
watch for the dead ringers.
I need you to back off.
I don't wanna let that bastard out of my sight.
I can't connect with him with you in his face.
he can't focus.
I need to do this alone.
you will have your time to talk to him through me.
but not until i've talked to him first.
she's alive.
what are you doing here?
please, can we just talk?
Todd, who is she?
she's a nosy neighbor from across the street.
but she knows.
what do you mean, she knows?
knows what?
she says your grandfather is haunting me.
Lyle's the one who's been doing all of this.
my dead grandfather.
he's still here.
and he's attached to Todd.
you don't know what it's been like.
she says that Lyle thinks that i killed you.
and you believe her.
your grandfather just wants to know what happened to you.
we have to tell him.
don't say anything else, Todd.
just chill out!
Stacy, he's not gonna leave me alone.
this man is trying to kill me.
your grandfather, he loves you...
he loves me.
did he love me when he sent me to that place?
I can help you talk to him.
he searched for you. He was heartbroken.
you must be talking about some other Lyle chase.
look, i didn't want to talk to him when he was alive.
I sure as hell don't wanna talk to him now.
Stacy, please.
I'm not Stacy anymore.
look, my grandfather is dead.
so did Stacy.
come on, Stacy!
I met Stacy my senior year.
she was one tough little girl.
of course, every other guy tried to hit on her.
but not you.
I'll tell you the truth.
I always thought she was way outta my league.
did she tell you why she decided to live with Lyle?
her mother was a drug addict and they were practically living on the streets.
her grandfather disowned her mother, you know, years before.
and when her mom dead, the old man decided he would take Stacy in.
he wasn't ready for her.
that's why he sent her away to boarding school.
boarding school?
is that what he called it?
wasn't it?
it was...
it was a boot camp for kids.
the shelter harbor school for boys and girls.
it was the kind of place where parents would send their kids to break their spirit.
they come and get you in the middle of the night.
there was this one teacher who really loved his job.
Mr. Papaso.
sadistic bastard, and he wanted to break Stacy in the worst way.
he'd play games with your head and beat you.
thank you, Mr. Papaso, sir!
one more, sir!
on the day she fought back, he...
he told her that she was going into the observation room.
we all knew that that room was run by papaso, and it was just another guaranteed beating.
she knew she'd never make it through 3 more years there.
so she decided to run away.
I just don't want anybody to come looking for her.
so you helped her stage her own murder.
that was the last time i saw her.
that's when you became a suspect?
the suspect.
didn't realize it would be such a big deal.
we were just stupid kids.
we didn't even know if faking your own murder was illegal.
then they started questioning me and...
people were out searching and...
it just got way too big.
no goin' back.
where did she go?
she's good at taking care of herself.
it's all she'd ever done since she was a kid.
you risked going to jail.
you... kept her secret all this time.
you really love her.
doesn't matter.
you know, i really changed for both of us that night.
she had to become somebody else and me, i...
I haven't had a good night's sleep since.
I feel like i'm cursed.
my guts are churning all the time and...
the past 8 years, i haven't lived anywhere longer than 6 months because of Lyle the friendly ghost.
maybe it's me who should be dead.
I want my life back.
he's lying!
he's not, Lyle.
I saw her for myself.
she's alive and well.
I don't believe it.
I wanna see her.
he doesn't believe it.
I know what we did was wrong, all right?
we didn't know what else to do.
I mean, there was...
nobody there for her.
you weren't there for her.
shelter harbor was the only place for her!
she was beaten, lyle.
there was a teacher there that singled her out.
she was abused.
I didn't know that.
he said he didn't know that.
that's bull.
you... you signed the papers, Lyle.
you gave them permission.
all necessary measures.
remember that?
and she tried to tell you, but you didn't care!
you're lying!
you're trying to make this all my fault!
you...
you are the one who killed her!
you...
you were the one who killed her!
stop it!
now, you stop it!
Stacy is alive and she chose to disappear because you wouldn't help her!
that is why you lost your granddaughter, all right?
not because he took her.
I never wanted to hurt her.
please...
you have to bring me to her.
I want to see her.
Stacy made it very clear she doesn't want to talk to you.
you have to bring me to her.
please.
do you know where she is?
she'll kill me.
you'll finally get your life back.
I don't understand.
why would she come back here?
it's completely different now.
see, she saw this as a chance to help kids like her, help make sure they'd feel safe here.
in a sense, she gives back.
go on, you guys.
I'll meet you on the field.
she's all grown up.
you shouldn't have done this.
you promised never to come here.
look, your grandfather is here, all right?
he knows everything that happened, and he feels terrible.
but he can't...
what's the thing?
cross over.
he can't cross over until he talks to you.
what are you doing, Todd?
tell her i have her locket.
your grandfather's telling me that he...
he has your locket, the one that he gave you when you were 10.
you told her about that?
no, i didn't.
what's on the locket?
what?
what's engraved on the locket?
patience.
he's here?
he can hear you.
you never gave me a chance... grandpa.
I just wanted to matter.
you tell her she did matter.
I thought i had to be tough with you so you wouldn't end up like your mother.
he was afraid that you'd end up like your mom.
I wanted you to save her, grandpa!
sweetheart, i tried to save her.
I couldn't.
you don't know.
Stacy, people do things and make choices.
sometimes they have to save themselves...
and sometimes they just can't.
but you did, Stace.
you saved yourself.
I would take it all back if i could.
I would do anything.
but look at her.
she grew up strong and she's so beautiful.
she's the picture of her mother.
he wants you to know that he's sorry.
and he would take it all back if he could.
and he's so proud.
he's really proud of who you are and he thinks you look just like your mother.
I'm so sorry, grandpa.
I should have told you that i was...
OK.
but then... I don't know what I'm doing.
you tell her... that i love her and i didn't know how much until she was gone.
what do you see?
it's so bright.
I could touch it.
that means you're ready.
you can cross over.
it's my daughter...
waiting for me.
he sees your mother.
mom?
she looks so happy.
thank you.
he's gone.
what's this? You just got here.
time to move on.
Why? Lyle's gone.
I got an interesting job offer.
teaching computer to the kids at shelter harbor, so...
I'll have room and board......
and...
what about your secret?
we decided to confront it all and let the chips fall.
I'm really sorry about everything.
you were never a dull neighbor.
good luck.
I can't thank you enough.
seriously, for me, for Stacy, and for lyle.
come here.
maybe you should just keep doing what you're doing
like you do it.
I can... i can adapt.
I can do that.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I love this dog.
I love you!
how are we gonna get you to cross over?
no crossing the dog over.
I like the way he makes you smile.
let's go home.
all right. - Ok.
so, will you do it?
no.
not fair.
you know, I have told you a thousand times
I'm not telling your boss his dead disgruntled employee put a hex on him.
first of all, there's no such thing.
he doesn't know that!
you know, there are people waiting for you in the light-- go.
you're not the boss of me.
real mature, Gary.
don't marry him, Elaine.
he just wants our money.
I know guys like this.
Ooh!
good morning.
so, did you talk to her?
your wife?
Yes, my wife at the rest home.
I'm sorry, I've been really busy, but I will try to get out there this weekend.
I promise.
sure, don't worry about me.
I've only been dead for 50 years.
I've got all the time in the world!
Ah, good morning.
Hey!
how you doing?
Oh, you know.
same old, same old.
you know, you seem suspiciously cheerful.
hmm, do I?
Oh, well.
I met somebody the other night.
do tell.
OK, he's a teacher at the high school, but at night he's this unbelievable spoken word poet.
you have to hear his stuff.
he's handsome.
he's sensitive.
and he's tall.
sold!
actually he's performing tonight at this poetry slam thing in bay ridge.
do you want to go?
Absolutely.
I want to meet the guy that has you looking like this.
like what?
like you just grabbed the gold ring on the merry-go-round.
ha!
hmm.
you know, like really.
um, so should we take my car to the reading?
uh, no, I should probably drive on my own.
otherwise I'll have to double back.
Oh, ok. You have the directions, right?
Yes.
evening, ma'am.
there's a chill in the air tonight.
that's why I have on my jacket.
I'm not even gonna ask.
Yeah.
OK. Ok.
see you there.
see you there.
you.
you're the one who can see us.
do I know you?
it was a cemetery.
huh! Aah!
no one saw what happened?
there were no witnesses?
I should have made her ride with me.
Hey, come on, dear, how could you know?
where is the doctor?
I need some answers.
I can't just sit here.
calm down.
don't tell me to calm down.
I'm her mother.
I know the people at this hospital.
she's gonna get the best care.
believe me.
Hey. How is she?
there's been some intracranial swelling.
yeah?
and she's in a light coma at the moment, but I have every hope.
doctor, I'm a nurse.
he's a paramedic.
you don't have to play the happy game with us.
a coma is a coma.
all right.
what's next?
what do we do now?
well, for now we monitor her vital signs carefully and wait.
Aah!
who's that?
where is everybody?
mom, I'm scared.
come on, dear.
we'll go into it together.
no. Hear me.
don't leave me.
I'm sorry.
grandma, I can't.
not yet.
that's all right, dear.
all in good time.
I saw it.
I saw the light.
God.
guys, this is ridiculous.
I rested for a week in the hospital. I'm fine.
Oh, yeah?
Really?
what happened the night you fell?
do you remember?
not exactly. Mmm.
Where's Homer?
Homer? Who's Homer?
uh, he's our dog.
sort of.
actually, he's a ghost dog.
a ghost dog!
how cute!
I bet you are hungry after that hospital food.
I'm gonna fix you a nice breakfast.
what is with her?
I don't know.
she's so cheerful.
what happened to the woman who couldn't bear to hear about ghosts?
she is freaking me out.
well, she did stay up all night in the hospital wondering if she'd ever talk to her daughter again.
that would make anybody cheerful.
where are you going?
wait, no, no. Go back.
well, that's funny.
what?
Gary's not out there.
remind me.
he wants me to tell his boss, oh, yeah, there's a hex on him. Right.
Yeah, well, he's been out there every morning since he died a few months ago.
well, maybe he gave up.
no, he's not the giving up type.
and you know what's weird is I have not seen one ghost in a whole week.
maybe they're just being considerate.
ghosts are a lot of things.
considerate is not one of them.
coffee or tea, darling?
coffee.
apparently a lot of things are weird.
you know, when I go back to work tomorrow... Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.
no going back to work.
you just got out of the hospital.
I'm fine.
besides, that week I was in the hospital was the most boring month of my life.
boredom is underrated.
boredom is boring, ok?
and you can't stop me, so don't even try.
three days a week. No.
Half-days. That's my final offer.
or what?
or I will withhold my husbandly attention.
you don't mean that.
Mm-hmm.
give me strength.
you don't mean that.
all right, fine.
Half-days.
Ah, she gave in to my superior will.
Yeah, but my first half-day starts today.
Ah, what are you gonna do? It's a sunday.
open mail.
smell the lotion.
you really do love the place, don't you?
I do!
it's beautiful, and look, the rain has washed everything so clean.
Mm-hmm.
this is definitely weird.
what?
the regulars are gone.
the regulars?
Yeah, the cranky guy, the boy pushing the thing.
rancher on a horse.
Oh. Do you really see that many ghosts from other times?
sure. I just block them out.
Oh, you know who that is?
that's Mr. Keeler.
Gary's boss.
he's the guy with a hex on him, huh?
he doesn't really have a hex on him.
Mr. Keeler!
you all right? -No!
first these punks deface my property.
now the building's falling apart.
just one piece of bad luck after another.
what? Honey?
Gary's up there. -He has to be.
Gary, you come down here and show yourself right now!
honey, honey, calm down.
no, this is crazy.
why can't I see him?
he was just up there.
he made the thing come down.
what if it's me?
think about it.
I haven't seen one ghost since the accident, not even in the hospital.
what if the ghosts are really here, right in front of me, and I just can't see them anymore?
shh, honey. Come on.
it's all right.
I dreamt about him.
I saw this tiger come charging towards me.
that was the name of their team: The tigers.
and you saw the jersey?
I think I saw Brian, too.
right before I had the accident.
my heart broke for her.
losing your first love like that so suddenly.
so this is where it happened?
Yeah.
I thought if I came back here,
I might pick up something.
like a feeling.
anything.
And?
nothing.
at least not.
wait.
no. No!
what? What is it? It's breathing.
what's breathing? What?
it was--it was there!
and the heartbeat, it just kept getting louder and louder.
Oh, my god,
I'm going crazy.
aunt Diane, it was Brian, I know.
it's like he's dying all over again.
that was a great night out.
Yeah, the food was great.
not just the food.
the peace.
what do you mean?
remember that one restaurant we had to leave because the dead chef kept yelling about how bad the living shift was?
I could barely get a bite.
Oh, right.
you're not fooling anybody, you know.
what do you mean?
look, I know how miserable this makes you, losing you gift.
why are you pretending it doesn't?
because I thought it would make you happy.
you know, to have a normal wife that you don't have to worry about all the time.
I thought it would be a relief.
look.
I worry,
I admit it.
but I would rather have all the worry in the world than to see the light go out of your eyes.
you can tell me how you really feel.
I can't take it.
how does a person just lose a piece of themselves like this?
you know, making contacts with spirits, it's--it's what I did, it's how I helped people.
and now I feel like I just don't know who I am anymore.
and I tried to help this poor girl talk to her dead boyfriend, and I just feel like a big fake.
Hey, shh. I do.
give it time.
people change.
it's what life is.
and that's what we have to make room for.
I'll tell you one thing that'll never change.
that's what gets me through.
I know, it was my day off, and I suddenly realized I have never seen your shop before.
isn't that ridiculous?
I hope you don't mind me popping in like this.
no, mom, of course not.
it's just...
a surprise.
well, it's a surprise for me too.
I've been looking back over these past few years, and I realized I have become completely housebound and I didn't even know it.
Oh, this place is absolutely adorable.
you girls do this all by yourself?
mom, are you taking something?
taking something?
Yeah, like a mood stabilizer.
no, I'm just
I'm feeling really well lately.
even my migraines are completely gone.
excuse me, I'm looking for something in a pastel to go with my eyes.
right on time. Come on now.
only a fool would be late for lunch with you.
you must be Ashton.
Yes. Ashton Beluso. This is Melinda Gordon and her mom Beth.
hello.
did she tell you that we're going to your slam poetry thing tomorrow night?
Yes, she did, and I'm flattered, but I just hope that I don't fall off the stage.
Oh, trust me, he owns the stage.
um, we're gonna go to lunch.
really nice to meet you.
nice to meet you too, melinda.
Mrs. Gordon.
Bye.
what a lovely young man.
so nice to see two people so happy together.
you know, you have a very interesting definition of half-day.
well, I had to entertain my mother for an hour.
then I needed an hour to come down from it.
and then yet another wistful hour trying to figure out why she couldn't be this happy when I was 13.
well, better late than never.
true. See you tomorrow.
half!
I don't think you want to do this, Caitlin.
where did you come from?
I work across the street.
look, will you please just leave me alone?
sure. You just suck that whole bottle down and then drive yourself home. Works for me.
fine. Have the car.
Hey. Hey. I know you're in pain.
no, you don't know anything!
I just want it all to stop.
well, that's not the way to erase it.
well, it's worth a try.
you know, you have people that love you.
your aunt, your father.
my father doesn't love me.
he hates me because I remind him of my mom.
your aunt Diane loves you, and she lost her son.
do you really want to go breaking her heart by hurting yourself too?
I just feel so empty. -I know.
I thought Brian was trying to reach me, and now I just think I'm going crazy.
Hey, you're not. He's out there. I believe that.
well, where is he?
aunt Diane said you could show me.
I need to talk to him.
I can't do that. Why not?
because something's happened to me.
I stopped seeing them, and I don't know why.
but you know, sometimes you just have to go on faith, cause that's what I'm going on right now.
why don't you just face the fact they're not out there?
there's nothing out there but nightmares and bad memories.
that's not true.
Yes, it is, and you might have fooled my aunt Diane, but you're not gonna fool me.
you're a big fake, and I'm on to you.
so why don't you just get out of here and leave me alone?
thank you for doing this.
any friend of my sister's...
so you're hearing a rattle?
all the time? -No, just sometimes.
maybe it's the muffler or something.
I really enjoyed meeting your daughter Caitlin.
Oh, yeah?
well, you didn't have any luck figuring out what was wrong with her, did you?
it's not that simple, I guess.
I'm not surprised.
she won't talk to me.
she won't talk to diane.
still, she does need your support.
Caitlin doesn't look to me for support.
she looks right through me, you want to know the truth.
Mr. Emerson, you may think that this is none of my business, but the one thing that I did find out about Caitlin is that she is very troubled, and she doesn't feel like she can talk to you about it.
she thinks that you connect her with her mother and dislike her for it.
she told you that?
I can't get two words out of her.
she told you all that.
she's grieving, Mr. Emerson.
she just lost somebody that she loved.
I know something about loss myself, Ms. Gordon.
my wife left me when Caitlin was two.
I had to raise her all by myself.
I provided for her, and I kept her safe.
she's my little girl, and now she looks at me-- she looks at me like she hates me.
she looks at me like she can't wait to leave me too.
I'm sorry.
nothing wrong with your car, is there?
have a nice day.
Adam, a little compassion.
Caitlin has had a traumatic experience, and sometimes shock can cause unusual behavior.
we've just got to show her that we're here for her and that we care.
you're a good sister.
I don't know what I'd do if you weren't here.
this is way beyond me.
Melinda Gordon has a very special gift.
she helped me with Jason.
I believe she can help me with Caitlin, too.
hope to hell you're right.
I'm ok.
I'm ok.
I'm ok.
what's the matter? What's the matter, honey?
all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
OK, now it's time for a poetry lounge favorite.
writes some powerful stuff that I know y'all are gonna enjoy.
so please put your hands together for my dog,
give it up for Ashton, man.
thank you. Thank you. It's good to be here.
like to say hello to two of my friends.
this poem is called Agera.
the wind is weirdly warm.
it pulls and it rips.
departing spirits struggle with the silver coils of fog.
tormented souls are easy prey still being haunted by what might have been.
the young and the passionate resist the best-- sometimes for days.
the peaceful are immune.
but who amongst us are in tune with that kind of peace?
the man is laughing.
stand back and watch the hordes of these conflicted souls perform their final unconflicted act.
you have no choice.
that's what I'm talking about!
one more time, man, for Ashton Beluso. Wow!
Andrea. So what'd you think?
it was crazy good.
you liked it. -I loved it.
Oh, it was so powerful.
don't you think, melinda?
I don't understand.
where did you get that?
get what?
the part about the departing ghosts getting pulled away.
the silvery fog and everything.
Oh, this crazy dream I had the other night.
there were these two dark figures in some kind of mass exodus.
I don't know.
I just write what comes to me, you know?
so, look, I got to stay. One of my students is going up, and I promised I'd listen.
so I'll see you later?
all right. Ok.
I think he's a sensitive.
what? -A sensitive.
my grandma told me about them.
I've only met one or two before.
they're people that are somehow in tune with the larger picture.
and they get a feeling about something before it even happens.
wow, I'm dating a sensitive.
you know what? Ashton's dream?
I've seen it in real life.
no way!
the day I got into my accident, there was a ghost family in the road, and I stopped to try and help them, but they got whisked away just like Ashton said.
how can he see them in a dream and I can't find Brian to save my life.
I mean, it's not fair.
I just wish that my grandmother was here so I could...
what?
I know who I'm gonna have to talk to about this.
Mmm, it's delicious.
for some reason, everything is tasting so much better to me lately.
do you know why that is?
no, I don't, but whatever it is, I'm not gonna question it.
I wonder.
I know that you don't like it when I bring up the spirit world...
haven't seen a one.
haven't heard a thing.
nothing?
no.
blessed silence.
interesting. I haven't either for about a week now.
Really?
Oh, this is wonderful.
you must be so happy.
no, mom, I'm not.
I know, I know.
you embrace your gift.
Melinda, you can say this till the cows come home, but aren't you just a little bit relieved?
no.
hmm.
maybe it's like...
allergies, you know?
you grow out of it.
you always had migraines, right?
because you were trying to suppress the visions, the sounds.
but your headaches are gone now.
what if there aren't any visions or sounds to suppress?
what if the spirits themselves have just vanished?
couldn't be.
they're all around us, always.
that is what is so annoying about them.
do you really feel annoyed, mom?
because to me you've never seemed so lighthearted.
does it really seem likely that we would both lose our gift at the same time?
so what are you saying?
they've gone somewhere else?
I don't know.
maybe. Yeah.
for good?
I hope not.
OK, this is all good.
but I don't want you to overdo it just 'cause you feel good.
let's remember you suffered a head trauma, so the slightest symptom and you tell Jim right away.
there isn't anything I don't tell Jim.
is that really true that you tell Jim everything?
Yeah, why?
Mmm, I'm surprised, I guess.
I never told your father about my visions.
I was afraid it would be too disturbing.
course he ended up leaving me anyway, so so much for my instincts on that one.
you never talk about him.
why should I?
he's out of our life.
but I must say in retrospect, maybe if I had told him...
course it's water under the bridge now, isn't it?
time of death, 14: 35.
mom, did you see that?
what?
no.
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Andrea, I saw one.
you did?
where?
at the hospital.
I never lost my gift. They've just gone away.
but I don't get it. Where to?
no idea. One thing at a time.
wow, this probably sounds like an odd conversation.
no, no. Yeah.
she'll explain it to you.
ashton, you wouldn't happen to have a copy of your poem with you, would you?
my poem? No, it's all in my head.
I'm trying to remember this part about who can resist the wind force.
you said the tortured ghosts went immediately, and the young ones -- young and the passionate resist the best -- sometimes for days.
right, sometimes for days!
which means that I still have time.
thank you.
wait, wait!
where are you going?
Brian's still out there.
I'm sure of it. I just missed him.
OK, this is gonna take some explaining.
Mmm.
Yeah.
I can help Caitlin. I wasn't sure before.
what are you doing here?
I'm absolutely sure that Brian is still earthbound.
what part of "leave me alone" is hard for you?
the part where I have to abandon somebody that I know I can help.
I'm sorry, I won't do it.
aunt Diane.
Melinda, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
I mean, Caitlin has resisted, and you're going through your own loss of abilities.
no, I won't lose faith in my gift anymore.
I know I can help you find brian, but you have to come with me right now.
No!
just stop it, ok?
I just need to be left alone.
you listen to her.
aunt Diane told me what she can do.
I don't know if I believe in all that stuff, but I think maybe you should.
dad, what are you talking about?
honey, I know you're in pain.
I know I haven't been here for you, but I know this boy means a lot to you.
I understand that now.
and I don't want this pain eating you up inside, Caitlin.
if you can find peace, that's what I want for you.
daddy, it hurts so bad.
Oh, honey, honey, honey.
I know.
Oh, you're my little girl.
you're everything to me.
I came here once before, but I gave up too soon.
something is pulling the spirits away, Caitlin, but the young and strong can resist.
Ryan is here.
I know he is.
come on.
my ring!
it's here.
Caitlin, he's here.
right now?
your ring, it acted as an anchor.
sometimes ghosts can attach themselves to things that have a deeper meaning to them.
it can give them strength.
something's been trying to pull me away.
something bad.
we should get out from under here.
that wind could start up again.
please tell her.
I didn't want to break up with her.
he didn't want to break up, Caitlin.
he didn't?
well, who was that girl?
the one I saw him with in the street.
Caitlin, she was my dance teacher.
your dance teacher?
his dance teacher?
Oh, my god.
he was learning how to dance just for me?
I wanted to make you happy.
I wanted to be able to dance with you and not look like an idiot.
he was trying to make you happy.
he thought his dancing was-- horrible.
I just saw her, and she looked so pretty.
and I was afraid that you woke up and realized that you shouldn't be with someone like me.
Caitlin, I woke up every day and realized how lucky I was to be with someone like you.
didn't you know that?
didn't you know I loved you?
he wants you to know that he woke up every day thinking how lucky he was to have you.
he wants to know if you knew how much he loved you.
I know now.
Brian, I don't know how I'm gonna live without you.
you're the only person that I've ever met that's made me feel special.
like I count.
tell her she'll find that again.
tell her that I want her to.
for me.
he believes that you'll find that again, and he wants you to for him.
I will never find anyone like you, Brian.
you learned how to dance just for me!
and now we'll never get that chance.
Caitlin, close your eyes.
what?
just close your eyes.
I want you to take Caitlin in your arms.
for real?
for real.
it may take her a minute to feel it, but I want you to show her what you learned.
and you have to be open to this, Caitlin, ok?
just trust Brian.
I do.
OK, brian.
I feel him.
it's called a box step.
pretty simple.
it's the box step.
and then he crossed over?
then he crossed over.
that's beautiful.
Yeah, it was something to see.
the power of love.
strong stuff, love.
something I know a little bit about.
Hey, what about your regulars?
they come back yet?
where is homer?
still missing.
all of them.
but at least we know I didn't lose my gift.
I saw two ghosts today.
look at how she sparkles when she says that.
Yeah, I'll admit it.
I enjoy being back in the game.
although that wind, it was warm and so creepy.
what do you think it means?
I wish I knew.
so, will you do it?
no.
not fair.
you know, I have told you a thousand times
I'm not telling your boss his dead disgruntled employee put a hex on him.
first of all, there's no such thing.
he doesn't know that!
you know, there are people waiting for you in the light-- go.
you're not the boss of me.
real mature, Gary.
don't marry him, Elaine.
he just wants our money.
I know guys like this.
Ooh!
good morning.
so, did you talk to her?
your wife?
Yes, my wife at the rest home.
I'm sorry, I've been really busy, but I will try to get out there this weekend.
I promise.
sure, don't worry about me.
I've only been dead for 50 years.
I've got all the time in the world!
Ah, good morning.
Hey!
how you doing?
Oh, you know.
same old, same old.
you know, you seem suspiciously cheerful.
hmm, do I?
Oh, well.
I met somebody the other night.
do tell.
OK, he's a teacher at the high school, but at night he's this unbelievable spoken word poet.
you have to hear his stuff.
he's handsome.
he's sensitive.
and he's tall.
sold!
actually he's performing tonight at this poetry slam thing in bay ridge.
do you want to go?
Absolutely.
I want to meet the guy that has you looking like this.
like what?
like you just grabbed the gold ring on the merry-go-round.
ha!
hmm.
you know, like really.
um, so should we take my car to the reading?
uh, no, I should probably drive on my own.
otherwise I'll have to double back.
Oh, ok. You have the directions, right?
Yes.
evening, ma'am.
there's a chill in the air tonight.
that's why I have on my jacket.
I'm not even gonna ask.
Yeah.
OK. Ok.
see you there.
see you there.
you.
you're the one who can see us.
do I know you?
it was a cemetery.
huh! Aah!
no one saw what happened?
there were no witnesses?
I should have made her ride with me.
Hey, come on, dear, how could you know?
where is the doctor?
I need some answers.
I can't just sit here.
calm down.
don't tell me to calm down.
I'm her mother.
I know the people at this hospital.
she's gonna get the best care.
believe me.
Hey. How is she?
there's been some intracranial swelling.
yeah?
and she's in a light coma at the moment, but I have every hope.
doctor, I'm a nurse.
he's a paramedic.
you don't have to play the happy game with us.
a coma is a coma.
all right.
what's next?
what do we do now?
well, for now we monitor her vital signs carefully and wait.
Aah!
who's that?
where is everybody?
mom, I'm scared.
come on, dear.
we'll go into it together.
no. Hear me.
don't leave me.
I'm sorry.
grandma, I can't.
not yet.
that's all right, dear.
all in good time.
I saw it.
I saw the light.
God.
guys, this is ridiculous.
I rested for a week in the hospital. I'm fine.
Oh, yeah?
Really?
what happened the night you fell?
do you remember?
not exactly. Mmm.
Where's Homer?
Homer? Who's Homer?
uh, he's our dog.
sort of.
actually, he's a ghost dog.
a ghost dog!
how cute!
I bet you are hungry after that hospital food.
I'm gonna fix you a nice breakfast.
what is with her?
I don't know.
she's so cheerful.
what happened to the woman who couldn't bear to hear about ghosts?
she is freaking me out.
well, she did stay up all night in the hospital wondering if she'd ever talk to her daughter again.
that would make anybody cheerful.
where are you going?
wait, no, no. Go back.
well, that's funny.
what?
Gary's not out there.
remind me.
he wants me to tell his boss, oh, yeah, there's a hex on him. Right.
Yeah, well, he's been out there every morning since he died a few months ago.
well, maybe he gave up.
no, he's not the giving up type.
and you know what's weird is I have not seen one ghost in a whole week.
maybe they're just being considerate.
ghosts are a lot of things.
considerate is not one of them.
coffee or tea, darling?
coffee.
apparently a lot of things are weird.
you know, when I go back to work tomorrow... Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.
no going back to work.
you just got out of the hospital.
I'm fine.
besides, that week I was in the hospital was the most boring month of my life.
boredom is underrated.
boredom is boring, ok?
and you can't stop me, so don't even try.
three days a week. No.
Half-days. That's my final offer.
or what?
or I will withhold my husbandly attention.
you don't mean that.
Mm-hmm.
give me strength.
you don't mean that.
all right, fine.
Half-days.
Ah, she gave in to my superior will.
Yeah, but my first half-day starts today.
Ah, what are you gonna do? It's a sunday.
open mail.
smell the lotion.
you really do love the place, don't you?
I do!
it's beautiful, and look, the rain has washed everything so clean.
Mm-hmm.
this is definitely weird.
what?
the regulars are gone.
the regulars?
Yeah, the cranky guy, the boy pushing the thing.
rancher on a horse.
Oh. Do you really see that many ghosts from other times?
sure. I just block them out.
Oh, you know who that is?
that's Mr. Keeler.
Gary's boss.
he's the guy with a hex on him, huh?
he doesn't really have a hex on him.
Mr. Keeler!
you all right? -No!
first these punks deface my property.
now the building's falling apart.
just one piece of bad luck after another.
what? Honey?
Gary's up there. -He has to be.
Gary, you come down here and show yourself right now!
honey, honey, calm down.
no, this is crazy.
why can't I see him?
he was just up there.
he made the thing come down.
what if it's me?
think about it.
I haven't seen one ghost since the accident, not even in the hospital.
what if the ghosts are really here, right in front of me, and I just can't see them anymore?
shh, honey. Come on.
it's all right.
I dreamt about him.
I saw this tiger come charging towards me.
that was the name of their team: The tigers.
and you saw the jersey?
I think I saw Brian, too.
right before I had the accident.
my heart broke for her.
losing your first love like that so suddenly.
so this is where it happened?
Yeah.
I thought if I came back here,
I might pick up something.
like a feeling.
anything.
And?
nothing.
at least not.
wait.
no. No!
what? What is it? It's breathing.
what's breathing? What?
it was--it was there!
and the heartbeat, it just kept getting louder and louder.
Oh, my god,
I'm going crazy.
aunt Diane, it was Brian, I know.
it's like he's dying all over again.
that was a great night out.
Yeah, the food was great.
not just the food.
the peace.
what do you mean?
remember that one restaurant we had to leave because the dead chef kept yelling about how bad the living shift was?
I could barely get a bite.
Oh, right.
you're not fooling anybody, you know.
what do you mean?
look, I know how miserable this makes you, losing you gift.
why are you pretending it doesn't?
because I thought it would make you happy.
you know, to have a normal wife that you don't have to worry about all the time.
I thought it would be a relief.
look.
I worry,
I admit it.
but I would rather have all the worry in the world than to see the light go out of your eyes.
you can tell me how you really feel.
I can't take it.
how does a person just lose a piece of themselves like this?
you know, making contacts with spirits, it's--it's what I did, it's how I helped people.
and now I feel like I just don't know who I am anymore.
and I tried to help this poor girl talk to her dead boyfriend, and I just feel like a big fake.
Hey, shh. I do.
give it time.
people change.
it's what life is.
and that's what we have to make room for.
I'll tell you one thing that'll never change.
that's what gets me through.
I know, it was my day off, and I suddenly realized I have never seen your shop before.
isn't that ridiculous?
I hope you don't mind me popping in like this.
no, mom, of course not.
it's just...
a surprise.
well, it's a surprise for me too.
I've been looking back over these past few years, and I realized I have become completely housebound and I didn't even know it.
Oh, this place is absolutely adorable.
you girls do this all by yourself?
mom, are you taking something?
taking something?
Yeah, like a mood stabilizer.
no, I'm just
I'm feeling really well lately.
even my migraines are completely gone.
excuse me, I'm looking for something in a pastel to go with my eyes.
right on time. Come on now.
only a fool would be late for lunch with you.
you must be Ashton.
Yes. Ashton Beluso. This is Melinda Gordon and her mom Beth.
hello.
did she tell you that we're going to your slam poetry thing tomorrow night?
Yes, she did, and I'm flattered, but I just hope that I don't fall off the stage.
Oh, trust me, he owns the stage.
um, we're gonna go to lunch.
really nice to meet you.
nice to meet you too, melinda.
Mrs. Gordon.
Bye.
what a lovely young man.
so nice to see two people so happy together.
you know, you have a very interesting definition of half-day.
well, I had to entertain my mother for an hour.
then I needed an hour to come down from it.
and then yet another wistful hour trying to figure out why she couldn't be this happy when I was 13.
well, better late than never.
true. See you tomorrow.
half!
I don't think you want to do this, Caitlin.
where did you come from?
I work across the street.
look, will you please just leave me alone?
sure. You just suck that whole bottle down and then drive yourself home. Works for me.
fine. Have the car.
Hey. Hey. I know you're in pain.
no, you don't know anything!
I just want it all to stop.
well, that's not the way to erase it.
well, it's worth a try.
you know, you have people that love you.
your aunt, your father.
my father doesn't love me.
he hates me because I remind him of my mom.
your aunt Diane loves you, and she lost her son.
do you really want to go breaking her heart by hurting yourself too?
I just feel so empty. -I know.
I thought Brian was trying to reach me, and now I just think I'm going crazy.
Hey, you're not. He's out there. I believe that.
well, where is he?
aunt Diane said you could show me.
I need to talk to him.
I can't do that. Why not?
because something's happened to me.
I stopped seeing them, and I don't know why.
but you know, sometimes you just have to go on faith, cause that's what I'm going on right now.
why don't you just face the fact they're not out there?
there's nothing out there but nightmares and bad memories.
that's not true.
Yes, it is, and you might have fooled my aunt Diane, but you're not gonna fool me.
you're a big fake, and I'm on to you.
so why don't you just get out of here and leave me alone?
thank you for doing this.
any friend of my sister's...
so you're hearing a rattle?
all the time? -No, just sometimes.
maybe it's the muffler or something.
I really enjoyed meeting your daughter Caitlin.
Oh, yeah?
well, you didn't have any luck figuring out what was wrong with her, did you?
it's not that simple, I guess.
I'm not surprised.
she won't talk to me.
she won't talk to diane.
still, she does need your support.
Caitlin doesn't look to me for support.
she looks right through me, you want to know the truth.
Mr. Emerson, you may think that this is none of my business, but the one thing that I did find out about Caitlin is that she is very troubled, and she doesn't feel like she can talk to you about it.
she thinks that you connect her with her mother and dislike her for it.
she told you that?
I can't get two words out of her.
she told you all that.
she's grieving, Mr. Emerson.
she just lost somebody that she loved.
I know something about loss myself, Ms. Gordon.
my wife left me when Caitlin was two.
I had to raise her all by myself.
I provided for her, and I kept her safe.
she's my little girl, and now she looks at me-- she looks at me like she hates me.
she looks at me like she can't wait to leave me too.
I'm sorry.
nothing wrong with your car, is there?
have a nice day.
Adam, a little compassion.
Caitlin has had a traumatic experience, and sometimes shock can cause unusual behavior.
we've just got to show her that we're here for her and that we care.
you're a good sister.
I don't know what I'd do if you weren't here.
this is way beyond me.
Melinda Gordon has a very special gift.
she helped me with Jason.
I believe she can help me with Caitlin, too.
hope to hell you're right.
I'm ok.
I'm ok.
I'm ok.
what's the matter? What's the matter, honey?
all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
OK, now it's time for a poetry lounge favorite.
writes some powerful stuff that I know y'all are gonna enjoy.
so please put your hands together for my dog,
give it up for Ashton, man.
thank you. Thank you. It's good to be here.
like to say hello to two of my friends.
this poem is called Agera.
the wind is weirdly warm.
it pulls and it rips.
departing spirits struggle with the silver coils of fog.
tormented souls are easy prey still being haunted by what might have been.
the young and the passionate resist the best-- sometimes for days.
the peaceful are immune.
but who amongst us are in tune with that kind of peace?
the man is laughing.
stand back and watch the hordes of these conflicted souls perform their final unconflicted act.
you have no choice.
that's what I'm talking about!
one more time, man, for Ashton Beluso. Wow!
Andrea. So what'd you think?
it was crazy good.
you liked it. -I loved it.
Oh, it was so powerful.
don't you think, melinda?
I don't understand.
where did you get that?
get what?
the part about the departing ghosts getting pulled away.
the silvery fog and everything.
Oh, this crazy dream I had the other night.
there were these two dark figures in some kind of mass exodus.
I don't know.
I just write what comes to me, you know?
so, look, I got to stay. One of my students is going up, and I promised I'd listen.
so I'll see you later?
all right. Ok.
I think he's a sensitive.
what? -A sensitive.
my grandma told me about them.
I've only met one or two before.
they're people that are somehow in tune with the larger picture.
and they get a feeling about something before it even happens.
wow, I'm dating a sensitive.
you know what? Ashton's dream?
I've seen it in real life.
no way!
the day I got into my accident, there was a ghost family in the road, and I stopped to try and help them, but they got whisked away just like Ashton said.
how can he see them in a dream and I can't find Brian to save my life.
I mean, it's not fair.
I just wish that my grandmother was here so I could...
what?
I know who I'm gonna have to talk to about this.
Mmm, it's delicious.
for some reason, everything is tasting so much better to me lately.
do you know why that is?
no, I don't, but whatever it is, I'm not gonna question it.
I wonder.
I know that you don't like it when I bring up the spirit world...
haven't seen a one.
haven't heard a thing.
nothing?
no.
blessed silence.
interesting. I haven't either for about a week now.
Really?
Oh, this is wonderful.
you must be so happy.
no, mom, I'm not.
I know, I know.
you embrace your gift.
Melinda, you can say this till the cows come home, but aren't you just a little bit relieved?
no.
hmm.
maybe it's like...
allergies, you know?
you grow out of it.
you always had migraines, right?
because you were trying to suppress the visions, the sounds.
but your headaches are gone now.
what if there aren't any visions or sounds to suppress?
what if the spirits themselves have just vanished?
couldn't be.
they're all around us, always.
that is what is so annoying about them.
do you really feel annoyed, mom?
because to me you've never seemed so lighthearted.
does it really seem likely that we would both lose our gift at the same time?
so what are you saying?
they've gone somewhere else?
I don't know.
maybe. Yeah.
for good?
I hope not.
OK, this is all good.
but I don't want you to overdo it just 'cause you feel good.
let's remember you suffered a head trauma, so the slightest symptom and you tell Jim right away.
there isn't anything I don't tell Jim.
is that really true that you tell Jim everything?
Yeah, why?
Mmm, I'm surprised, I guess.
I never told your father about my visions.
I was afraid it would be too disturbing.
course he ended up leaving me anyway, so so much for my instincts on that one.
you never talk about him.
why should I?
he's out of our life.
but I must say in retrospect, maybe if I had told him...
course it's water under the bridge now, isn't it?
time of death, 14: 35.
mom, did you see that?
what?
no.
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Andrea, I saw one.
you did?
where?
at the hospital.
I never lost my gift. They've just gone away.
but I don't get it. Where to?
no idea. One thing at a time.
wow, this probably sounds like an odd conversation.
no, no. Yeah.
she'll explain it to you.
ashton, you wouldn't happen to have a copy of your poem with you, would you?
my poem? No, it's all in my head.
I'm trying to remember this part about who can resist the wind force.
you said the tortured ghosts went immediately, and the young ones -- young and the passionate resist the best -- sometimes for days.
right, sometimes for days!
which means that I still have time.
thank you.
wait, wait!
where are you going?
Brian's still out there.
I'm sure of it. I just missed him.
OK, this is gonna take some explaining.
Mmm.
Yeah.
I can help Caitlin. I wasn't sure before.
what are you doing here?
I'm absolutely sure that Brian is still earthbound.
what part of "leave me alone" is hard for you?
the part where I have to abandon somebody that I know I can help.
I'm sorry, I won't do it.
aunt Diane.
Melinda, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
I mean, Caitlin has resisted, and you're going through your own loss of abilities.
no, I won't lose faith in my gift anymore.
I know I can help you find brian, but you have to come with me right now.
No!
just stop it, ok?
I just need to be left alone.
you listen to her.
aunt Diane told me what she can do.
I don't know if I believe in all that stuff, but I think maybe you should.
dad, what are you talking about?
honey, I know you're in pain.
I know I haven't been here for you, but I know this boy means a lot to you.
I understand that now.
and I don't want this pain eating you up inside, Caitlin.
if you can find peace, that's what I want for you.
daddy, it hurts so bad.
Oh, honey, honey, honey.
I know.
Oh, you're my little girl.
you're everything to me.
I came here once before, but I gave up too soon.
something is pulling the spirits away, Caitlin, but the young and strong can resist.
Ryan is here.
I know he is.
come on.
my ring!
it's here.
Caitlin, he's here.
right now?
your ring, it acted as an anchor.
sometimes ghosts can attach themselves to things that have a deeper meaning to them.
it can give them strength.
something's been trying to pull me away.
something bad.
we should get out from under here.
that wind could start up again.
please tell her.
I didn't want to break up with her.
he didn't want to break up, Caitlin.
he didn't?
well, who was that girl?
the one I saw him with in the street.
Caitlin, she was my dance teacher.
your dance teacher?
his dance teacher?
Oh, my god.
he was learning how to dance just for me?
I wanted to make you happy.
I wanted to be able to dance with you and not look like an idiot.
he was trying to make you happy.
he thought his dancing was-- horrible.
I just saw her, and she looked so pretty.
and I was afraid that you woke up and realized that you shouldn't be with someone like me.
Caitlin, I woke up every day and realized how lucky I was to be with someone like you.
didn't you know that?
didn't you know I loved you?
he wants you to know that he woke up every day thinking how lucky he was to have you.
he wants to know if you knew how much he loved you.
I know now.
Brian, I don't know how I'm gonna live without you.
you're the only person that I've ever met that's made me feel special.
like I count.
tell her she'll find that again.
tell her that I want her to.
for me.
he believes that you'll find that again, and he wants you to for him.
I will never find anyone like you, Brian.
you learned how to dance just for me!
and now we'll never get that chance.
Caitlin, close your eyes.
what?
just close your eyes.
I want you to take Caitlin in your arms.
for real?
for real.
it may take her a minute to feel it, but I want you to show her what you learned.
and you have to be open to this, Caitlin, ok?
just trust Brian.
I do.
OK, brian.
I feel him.
it's called a box step.
pretty simple.
it's the box step.
and then he crossed over?
then he crossed over.
that's beautiful.
Yeah, it was something to see.
the power of love.
strong stuff, love.
something I know a little bit about.
Hey, what about your regulars?
they come back yet?
where is homer?
still missing.
all of them.
but at least we know I didn't lose my gift.
I saw two ghosts today.
look at how she sparkles when she says that.
Yeah, I'll admit it.
I enjoy being back in the game.
although that wind, it was warm and so creepy.
what do you think it means?
I wish I knew.
breakfast?
it's no funny poor little guy crushed to the window sorry 16 hours' shift. Can we have fun over your empathy look how beatiful he is, I feel terrible.
I tell you what. When I wake up later i'll give it proper bury sorry - you don't see any spirit here, don't you? - no see, crossed over and everything. happier?
somebody slept in late.
Yeah, Andrea open it today hey, you want some eggs?
no, I'll just have some juice I took the new guy to breakfast this morning.
Oh, How's it going?
what can I say? He is new he is green, he wants to see blood.
how does this happened?
this is how it ends just leave it
I just need go to bed I'll go back to work at two or I can stick a frozen chunk of bacon to your mouth while you were sleeping good night morning, good evening, whatever it is
I know you see us.
when you're out here, that usually means there's something in there.
no, no, no.
Tiffany Cogan said she's gonna retire and close the bakery right next door to us.
no more apple cobblers? That's a good thing?
it means we can expand.
think about it.
we can knock down the wall in the middle and combine the fronts.
expand? I thought we were just settling into what we have.
Oh, come on. It'll be great.
think of all the extra floor space.
we could take much bigger consignments.
you really have a lot of free time on your hands.
I really do.
you know, my sensitive poet is touring the deep south this week.
what? - Sorry.
it's just hard to put those images together-- Ashton, Poetry slam, Alabama.
I'm ok now.
what?
do you see that?
Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you.
there is something really weird going on with the A/C and it was, like, 25 degrees in there when I came in to open this morning.
wow, we should call them.
I already called the repair guy and he promises to be here within a year.
I made this amazing sketch, so let me come show you.
you know, I don't feel like going to work yet.
you ok?
Yeah. I don't know.
it's just
it's been a weird day so far.
do you want some coffee?
I don't need to be any more wired, but you should go, ok?
well, come with me.
just stay out of the store, you know, until they fix the A/C.
I'll be fine. I've got sweaters and a suit if I need it.
hurry back, ok?
and your biscone.
thank you.
I know. The usual.
what can I get you, doll?
a latte, please.
a latte it is.
your latte?
keep the change.
sure. Next!
when are these repair guys coming?
Christmas?
Yeah, I know. I'd like to break up some furniture and make a fire.
Hey, look at this.
see, what I'm thinking is that we could leave half a wall here and then maybe make the edges to look like they're serrated?
you know, you are really amazing.
your brother must have rubbed off on you-- a real estate mogul in the making.
speaking of my brother, it's his birthday tomorrow.
look what I got him.
you know how much he loves watches.
Wow. That's incredible.
Thanks. I'm gonna give it to him on saturday.
why not tomorrow?
he's on some big business trip overseas, some huge timeshare deal or something.
I think it's great that you guys are really close.
I wish I had a brother or sister.
well, it wasn't always that way.
we did not get along when we were kids.
we've always been more different than alike.
do you know we once went for 2 years without speaking?
Really? Why?
Ah, it was just...
he was always such a go-getter, you know, so ambitious, and I like to lay back and let things come to me.
we had the most terrible fights.
I once called him a sell-out and worse.
Wow. That doesn't sound like you.
that's the way I was back then.
he thought I was a rebel and a loser.
OK. Note to self--be grateful that I don't have angry brothers and sisters.
you know what the great thing was, though?
he was always there for me, no matter what kind of trouble I got into.
he saw that I had some growing up to do, and he was patient with me.
I didn't see it back then, but...
now we're best friends.
look at the inscription.
do you think it's weird that I wrote that to my brother?
no.
no. I think it's just right.
you might want to set it to the right time.
Oh. I thought I did.
that's weird.
what time does it say on the clock in the square?
Melinda?
sorry. Yeah.
it says 25 after 2: 00.
Wow. Must not have wound it enough.
so, want to talk about architects?
I tried so hard to work in the city, man, but the waiting list, forget it.
why the city?
are you kidding me?
cause I don't want less than, you know, like, 10 calls a night.
you used to work in the city, right? - Yep.
you must have seen some stuff, huh?
what do you want from this job, joe?
to do good.
help people, save lives.
and to drive that bad boy real fast.
right. That's why the keys are gonna stay in my pocket.
what's your background?
2 years of MED school at Columbia.
Columbia. Nice. How about the real world?
Oh, I did some time in the E. R. Loved it.
life and death, ticking clock, the whole thing.
so I wanted more of that and less classroom lectures and chemistry, so I trained for this.
I think this is gonna be more immediate.
well, right now, immediately, we need to check the tire pressure and the oil.
your heart racing yet?
that's what I mean.
I can't believe they sent me to a place like this.
I'm on the job 2 days.
so far I've gone on one call to help a lady who couldn't find her way home.
feel like you're wasting your time?
that's not what I'm saying.
it's just--whoa.
I'd like to help her find her way home.
stand down, sparky.
Hi. - Hey.
John, this is my wife Melinda.
Melinda, this keg of adrenaline right here is John Gregory, probationary paramedic.
Hi. - Welcome.
you brought me soup.
Yeah. I thought you could use it.
we're gonna take a little break.
keep an eye on things.
sure.
that's the new guy?
Yeah. He wants things to be immediate.
that's why he moved to Grandview?
his point, exactly.
Hey, how was your day?
weird.
what? Like, ghost weird?
are they back?
no. I mean, there was something this morning while you were sleeping...
a voice.
what?
Oh, it's just, I can't shake this feeling of dread, you know?
I think something terrible is gonna happen.
have you had this before?
no, not really. There's just a heaviness in the air.
sure it's not the kitchen vent at lento's on the square?
you know, I am trying to be serious here. - Too serious.
I don't want to go home without you.
my shift's almost over.
I'll be home by 10: 00.
promise? - Promise.
unless of course, the heaviness in the air slows me down.
you're going down, Clancy.
Hey. My chief owes me 2 days off.
after my shift tomorrow, we can play a little hooky, maybe go catch an afternoon movie.
sounds good.
I better go check on the rookie. - Yeah.
well, at least the ghosts are back.
something's back.
I'm just not sure what.
Oh, oh, oh. We have to keep this pizza.
it has freezer burn.
what's wrong with freezer burn?
it makes it taste gross.
we can burn it off in the oven.
no, we won't.
Melinda, you've got to give a pizza a fighting chance.
OK, fine.
we will save the pizza frisbees.
Uhh! So...
what do they want.
these ghosts?
the ghosts want you to throw out that damn pizza.
besides that.
I don't think they know what they want.
well, at least you're seeing them now.
I mean, last week at this time, you thought you lost your gift.
Yeah. You thought I had, too.
I was hoping.
I'm kidding.
you're a liar.
it's just still so quiet out there.
I don't know where they've all gone.
it's like a huge vacuum.
you mean, like, Grandview is a ghost town?
you know what? I'm gonna spank you and hard.
stop it.
you know, I wish I could help you more.
you do. You listen.
Yeah, and what I'm hearing right now is that you're scared.
Yeah.
I'm just not sure of what.
who are you?
we're so cold.
who?
see, this is what I'm talking about.
if we had that space next door, we could build some really cool displays with trunks like this.
I've got a flyer for this architect over at Billy's shop and he's gonna come by later and take a look, ok?
and then I hope he rips off my clothes and has his way with me.
what?
welcome back.
sorry.
where were you?
I was thinking about this little visit I had last night.
Oh! So the ghosts haven't totally abandoned you!
no. I saw the one last night and heard one yesterday morning.
I just can't figure out why they are here and the rest are just gone.
it's weird. It's like they're half in this place and half in another place.
Oh. Like so many men I know.
sometimes they're talking in the present tense, sometimes they're talking in the past tense.
now, wait a second.
are these ghosts that died, like, suddenly or violently?
is that why they're so confused?
you know, usually I can solve a haunting pretty quickly.
I mean, the spirits have something they want to say to me or a problem that they need solved, but not these two.
they're not making any sense. It's like a riddle.
maybe you're not meant to solve it yet.
I just can't shake the feeling that it'smore important than ever for me to figure this one out.
do you hear that?
hear what?
what?
what? What? What is it?
hell if I know.
I'll be right back.
Melinda, this is Charlie Filbert, the architect that I was telling you about.
Oh, he's the one you were hoping would come by before his lunch.
I love your place. I walk past it all the time.
well, it's better for us when people come in, not just by.
my loss. So, you guys want to expand?
Yes. - Maybe.
well, it's really very simple.
I mean, you've got 1, 2, 3, 4 support columns including the brick, and you could punch a hole between any and/or all of them.
your biggest headache's gonna be getting permits from the town.
the planning board's not exactly business friendly.
how long would something like this take?
Charlie, I mean, do you think that we'd still be able to stay open?
we could do a lot of prep work on days you're closed, but you'd probably have to shut down for a week or so.
Or...or, you could knock the wall down while we're closed, and then we could put up some curtains or something and you just keep doing your thing on the other side.
curtains. You mean, like plastic sheeting and tarps?
Yeah, that.
is it always so cold in here?
I'm sorry. You know, we've been waiting for the workmen forever, and in fact, they were supposed to be here by now.
Damn! It stopped again!
you saw me set it.
what time did it stop?
I'm gonna take you back to the jeweler.
we could replicate this fascade, you know, if you like it.
we could just put it up...
I can hear you.
it's cold in the cabin.
we're all cold.
where are you?
in the woods?
are you trapped there?
something's wrong.
I have to find the door.
no. Wait. Tell me who you are.
I have to find the door.
uh...I was just listening...
for termites.
Mmm! I can't believe you did this.
Yeah, well, you were asleep when I left, and I didn't want you to eat alone.
breakfast of champions.
you know, they're closing soon, so enjoy it while you can.
Ah, it's a tragedy.
sit down.
no. I have to get back.
you're really in a bad place, aren't you?
it is obvious?
that's that smile.
same "trying to make it seem like everything's great when I'm really dying inside--help" smile.
it's disgusting how well you know me.
better than you think.
I added the "help."
I just have never really felt like this.
like what?
it's a million different feelings, really.
not just dread, but I feel like I have to rush, you know?
like maybe there's not enough time. - Time to what?
to live.
what are you saying?
don't be worried.
I'm just telling you how I feel.
I look at this room, and it is so beautiful.
the color, the light.
you.
and I feel like we don't spend enough time in this room.
we don't spend enough time together.
like maybe we're working too hard.
just rushing through our lives instead of living our lives.
maybe it's too late to even matter.
no.
everything we do, we're doing for a reason, doing it for the future.
Yeah, that's the point, I think.
what are we doing for the now?
well, I'm holding you now.
I love you right now.
what else matters?
just forget about it.
I am talking crazy.
what did I say?
don't even worry about it.
I don't really get it, either.
I have to get back to work. I'll talk to you soon.
where is your sense of adventure?
underneath my sense of biting off more than we can chew.
I just don't know if this is the right time.
why not? We'll get great tax breaks for property improvements.
Yeah, but how can we stay in business with them knocking down our walls?
I mean, the dust alone.
well, I mean, it'll be a challenge, yeah.
it'll be an adjustment, but we'll do it and it will be so worth it.
I don't know.
Hey, you gotta spend money to make money.
that's the first rule of business.
look, somehow I just feel like deep down, we might be tempting fate.
you know, to make a big move like this, commit to so much money when we don't know if we can absorb it.
what if it backfires?
OK, you know that's classic scarcity mentality.
Yeah. Guilty.
come on. We'll just get charlie over here, ok, and he can show you his plans and walk you through how we would do things.
and then, if it's still too scary, we can wait.
whoa, I am not scared.
I'm cautious.
whatever you say.
and can we please not let charlie see you listen to the walls this time?
good point.
Uhh! I don't know how much more of this cold I can take.
I can call the repair guys again.
what do you want?
the captain goes down with the ship.
I don't understand.
we'll all asleep.
we? Who's with you?
no one yet.
they're all still sleeping.
where are you?
we're close.
a uniform?
I'm not sure what kind, but not military.
he said, "a captain goes down with the ship."
are we talking about a boat?
I think he was a pilot.
it's the only thing that makes sense with the noises that I'm hearing.
if there was a plane crash, wouldn't we have heard about it?
unless it happened a long time ago.
or it happened a little while ago, and it's not on the news yet.
he said he was close.
what about these ghosts that keep rattling your doors?
I don't know. Someone else from the flight?
if it is a plane, something went seriously wrong.
Hey, what's wrong?
my brother is supposed to fly today.
from where?
south africa.
when I spoke to him last, he was gonna get a transfer for a couple of days for some kind of real estate conference.
he wants to be back by tonight.
Andrea, what are the chances?
what the hell is going on?
what happened at 10: 30?
and where?
so, I'm gonna take this back to the jeweler.
take your time.
stop him! Check him out!
my name's jim.
are you all right?
I've been better.
my hand.
what about your hand?
can you move it? - It's gone.
what?
it came off.
John! John!
Yeah, what's up?
get over here.
the driver's hand's been severed, ok?
we need to find it, get him to the hospital, see if they can reattach it.
he's also in shock. He'll be treated. He'll be fine.
he said it's over there. It could be anywhere. Go. Go!
you're gonna be all right.
John. John!
come here! Officer, come here!
keep it on his hand. Go.
you all right? What's the matter?
I got up too fast.
Where's the hand?
you take it.
take him on the passenger side door.
Hey, I was told to come over here and convince you.
is this a good time?
not an easy task, but sure, come on in.
when I walk out of here, you're gonna be ready to take over the block.
it's just, we're still such a new business.
I get it. So am I.
have you been in Grandview long?
not really. I was with a big firm in Chicago.
but my wife's from here.
she was dying to move back.
I took one look, said, "I'm in.
I want my daughter to grow up here."
would you like a hot cup of tea, Charlie?
Yeah. Thank you.
you know, how old is your daughter?
10.0
do you have kids?
no. No. Not yet, anyway.
but my husband, he is chomping at the bit.
exactly the opposite with us.
I didn't think I'd ever be ready.
thank you.
my wife couldn't wait.
so how is it, being a parent?
it's great, although I have to admit, my wife does most of the heavy lifting.
I've always been a bit of a workaholic.
Ah! Hence your visit here today to convince a skeptic.
I'll do anything to snag a new client.
my family's traveling this week, so I figured, keep extra busy.
they're not flying, are they?
no. They're driving from upstate. Why?
I was just curious.
I hate planes, you know? All the hassles.
me, too. I figure it's dangerous enough out there without leaving the ground.
OK. This is your new storage room, right?
Hi. Catch you at a bad time?
no, no. I'm good now.
I just had a little rookie trouble.
Oh, Mr. Adrenaline?
I'll tell you later.
if there's been anything with a plane today?
you mean, like a crash?
Yeah, I think so.
do you know anybody at the airports or where?
I don't really know. I'm thinking the east coast.
I checked the news on the web, but there doesn't seem to be anything coming up for a recent crash.
what about farther back?
I don't know.
the more I think about it, this ghost is so confused, it really feels like somebody newly dead.
you know, they both said something about being really cold.
maybe they crashed in some far away, remote place, and nobody's heard about it yet.
it's possible, but how would they know to come to me?
well, that is the $64, 000 question how they ever know to come to you.
can you just make some calls?
Yeah. I will.
I just think, if nothing's
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Andrea, I have to go across the street.
OK.
what are you looking for?
don't you know?
I thought you knew.
is it an airplane?
did an airplane crash?
I don't know yet.
what was the last thing that you saw?
the sky.
do you remember anything?
anything about where you went down?
there's been no crash.
no crash? I don't understand.
we're still flying.
we're still up there.
what?
the captain goes down with the ship.
Ooh! Sorry!
excuse me!
excuse me!
sorry!
Charlie, I am so sorry to be rude, but would you excuse us?
OK. I need my pencils.
Yeah. We're gonna send them over later.
Andrea, there's a plane.
it's still in the air.
the pilot is dead.
maybe the crew.
What?! How do you know this?
the pilot just told me.
what airline? What flight?
Hey, he was gone before I could ask.
OK. What do we do?
calls. The FAA for starters.
maybe you should try some of the airports.
and say what?
we're gonna sound like lunatics. - I don't know, ok?
don't even try to explain it.
just keep telling them until somebody listens.
OK, ok.
Yes, hello. I need the federal aviation administration.
thank you.
hello. There is a plane in the air.
no one is flying it.
the pilot is dead and maybe the crew.
Mitch, hi. It's Andrea.
look, I know you're on a plane right now, but can you please just call me when you land?
there's some really crazy stuff going on today.
I just--I just really need to know you're safe.
we can talk about how crazy this sounds later.
I'm just telling you what I know.
please. Is there somebody else that I
Hello?
Hi. I need to speak to somebody about a plane.
where am I?
you have to tell me.
are you on a plane?
I was.
I think I am.
what is the flight?
what is the airline?
there's no pressure.
we lost pressure.
it was a long flight.
lots of head winds.
we were more than an hour behind.
it was like the air just got sucked out of the plane.
we couldn't breathe.
open up.
it's real cold out here.
what's going on in there?
it's too cold out here!
we lost pressure.
what is the flight number?
what is the airline?
Trans-eastern air 395.
where did you take off from?
johannesburg.
the captain needs me.
well, is there someone else I can
look, I'm serious.
this plane may crash any minute.
damn it! Uhh!
these government people!
I've been hung up on 3 times already, and one of them actually asked me if I could get my mommy or daddy to come to the phone.
what?
Andrea, the plane...
the flight that took off in johannesburg.
no. No. It's too weird.
where are you going?
I'm gonna go to my brother's apartment and see if the doorman will let me in.
I'm sure there's something about his flights on his computer.
I have to know if he flew today.
Andrea, we should stay on the phones.
I'll come back!
what the hell happened back there.
like I said, I must have gotten up too fast.
come on, don't treat me like I'm stupid.
all right, look. It's just a problem I have sometimes.
things like that, they get to me.
how'd you handle it in MED school?
you didn't handle it in MED school.
I kept passing out in gross anatomy any time I saw blood.
I was invited to leave.
what the hell are you doing this for?
because I gotta get over it.
I can't let it stop me.
I don't want to be weak.
look, this job isn't for everyone, ok?
there's no shame in that.
if you can't hold it together out there, you're no good to me and you're no good to the patients.
I have to be able to count on you.
I just gotta learn to get hard about it and how not to care.
no. We're all gonna see things we don't want to see
blood, gore, a severed hand sometimes.
what you have to learn is to be able to look past it.
you know, you get that tunnel vision where the only thing you see is the person suffering, the person who needs to be saved.
focus on that.
did you hear that?
Jim.
it's all over the news.
they said a plane's heading right toward us.
did they say when?
I don't think they know.
the pilot said, "we're close."
go out on the square.
warn people. Tell them to get inside.
we're heading back.
hurry.
see if people are all right!
the plane went down.
are you ok?
I'm fine.
get inside.
Hey, are you all right? - Yeah.
come on.
Jim, that flight came in from Johannesburg.
Andrea's brother might have been on it.
where is she?
she drove in to the city to check his apartment.
she'll be right back.
there's gonna close all the bridges and tunnels in a couple of minutes.
come on. You gotta get inside.
be careful.
dispatch, dispatch. Grandview Mac-56.
I have a visual on an aircraft down about a mile, a mile and a half from the main street, due south.
let's start a first-alarm assignment to that location and show us responding.
Hey, look, you're on this one now, ok?
are you ready for this? - Yeah.
you're not gonna prove anything to yourself, understand? - Right.
let's go. Come on.
Melinda...
I was driving, and I saw it.
it went down right over me.
there were cars everywhere.
Andrea.
we should call--we should call someone.
the phones are out.
there's no signal.
I'll try mine.
we'll use my cell phone.
I know you see us.
my name is Melinda Gordon.
I'm married.
I live in a small town.
and I own an antique shop.
I might be just like you.
except that, from the time I was a little girl.
I knew that I could talk to the dead.
it's all right, honey.
earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.
they're stuck here because they have unfinished business with the living and they come to me for help.
in order to tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.
that looks great on you. With a top hat and a whip, fabulous.
if you need help getting out of that, I'm right over here.
God, I love Halloween.
my parents use to make such a big deal out of it.
when I was a kid, they used to decorate the house up like this big movie set.
it was so great.
were your parents into Halloween?
um, my mother hated it.
I don't know how my father felt.
Oh, why not?
he left when I was little.
I'm so sorry. - No, it's ok.
you know what? I think this table would look nicer next to the window.
can you help me? - Oh, sure.
has anyone in your family died recently?
what?
your extended family. It's pretty much intact?
Yeah. Amazingly long-lived, my family.
both of my grandmothers are still alive, and I have a great-great uncle who's 102.
Wow. Amazing! Everyone's still alive.
Hey, do you want to see the great undead lipstick that I got for Halloween?
sure. - Let me show you.
Oh, by the way, I am judging the pumpkin-carving contest at the school tonight.
you want to come?
I would, but I have plans with a friend.
Oh, well, friends are good. The more, the merrier.
she's not in a position to come, but thanks.
OK.
I swear I put it in here.
I don't know why I couldn't just tell her I was coming here.
I mean, Delia's a really nice person.
she's got a good sense of humor.
maybe it's just kind of hard to talk about.
I miss you so much, Andrea.
you will always be my best friend.
save a little piece of that light for me, ok?
ghosts! Ghosts! Ghosts! Ghosts!
this is wrong. - What's wrong?
this.
who are you? - This is wrong.
where am I? - Look, I know that you're confused.
it's only been a couple of months.
not me. - Excuse me?
I can't be here. I can't be.
Yes, you are here. I just saw you come out of that grave.
but it's not mine.
are you saying?
help me. I'm in the wrong grave.
can you see us?
so, a cemetery. It seems like a natural place for a ghost.
no, actually, it's not. Ghosts get their energy from the living.
there's more ghosts in a shopping mall than at a cemetery.
that explains all the lousy parking.
ghosts tend to go where the problem lies, and this ghost's problem is the cemetery.
how does someone get buried in the wrong grave?
hmm. Makes you wonder what they're doing at those mortuaries.
Oh, you don't want to know that.
no, I really don't.
so, assuming this guy is right, does that mean that the wrong body's in his grave?
makes sense. - Then what could I do about it?
not much, unless you can find the family.
I mean, they can order an exhumation.
you're going to need a lot more evidence than, um, "I talked to a ghost."
makes you wonder how they didn't know it was that guy.
the body must have been pretty messed-up.
Yeah. It was pretty bad.
cold? - No. It's just kind of creepy.
my work is usually on a higher plane. I'm not so used to the whole dead body thing.
you want to try getting used to the live body thing?
Ooh, that sounds nice.
I don't want to do much talking here.
go. Go!
go away! I'm not him!
stop it!
excuse me?
wow, stop this weather!
something like this happens every time I come here.
I think it's his way of telling me he knows I'm here.
that's a really nice way to think about it.
you look familiar to me. Have we met?
my name is Melinda Gordon.
I own an antique shop in town, same as it never was.
Yes, I love that place.
I bought a vase there last year from one of your employees.
lovely girl.
Yeah.
I'm Shelby Burris.
and this is my husband Steve.
I'm so sorry.
they say it gets better with time, but it doesn't seem to.
no, it doesn't.
he was kind and caring. He loved to laugh.
he sounds like a wonderful man.
were you actually there when they buried him?
did you get to say good-bye and see him one last time?
only in spirit.
there was so much damage, it had to be a closed coffin.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
it's ok. It's better to talk about it than keep it bottled up inside.
it was nice to meet you, Melinda.
I didn't ask, do you have a loved one buried here?
Yes.
the lovely girl from the store.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
life is so fleeting, isn't it?
you can be happy, things are going great, and then...
a sudden bolt of lightning can wipe it all out.
Yeah, that's true.
well, life is for the living, right?
what are you doing here?
that woman. She comes every day. She cries so hard...
but not for me.
is that why you're trying to get rid of her?
she thinks that you're her husband.
but I'm not.
who are you? - Godfrey.
do you know how you died?
it was a flash.
bright, hot.
I just--I don't-- I don't know.
I know that this is hard, and you feel really confused right now, but it's going to get better.
do you have a family? Anyone who can help us?
I was alone. I was always alone.
find my grave.
please.
wow, Adam Godfrey's a writer.
what's that?
Oh, sorry. Nothing.
Adam Godfrey? Great writer.
haven't you ever read<Lost Delusions> ?
honey, I saw you look right at me yesterday.
don't pretend you can't see me now.
I cannot talk.
sorry. I just had to cash her out. Did you need me?
no, no. I'm just looking for this book, < Lost Delusions >.
Oh, yeah. Our book club read that last year. Great book.
but the author was kind of a one-hit wonder, right?
well, let's see.
we all read it 3 or 4 times.
we tried to get the country club to name a sandwich after the main character.
it's about a young man struggling to find his ace in the world and failing miserably. Depressing, yet oddly uplifting.
Yep, that's the one.
I still have it at home, if you want to borrow it.
by the way, are you hungry? Because I am starved.
I totally lost track of time. Please go to lunch. I'll cover for you.
did you and Andrea ever just close up for a bit and go and have lunch together?
you know what? I-I can't, because I have an errand to run, so maybe some other time.
Hi. - Oh. Hi.
what are the chances? Twice in 2 days.
well, not so strange for me. I come every day.
can I ask you a question?
does the name Adam Godfrey mean anything to you?
no. Should it?
I just thought maybe he was one of your husband's friends.
steve had so many friends. How would I know him?
um, he was a writer. He's passed away now.
I'm sorry. I don't remember him.
if I do, I'll let you know.
can I ask you how your husband died?
Yeah. I thought I told you. A bolt of lightning.
what?
I know it sounds crazy, but that's how he died.
he was struck by lightning.
lightning? - That's what she said, but my ghost said that he died, and then there was a big flash of light.
and so?
so, what if they both died from some sort of electrical shock?
is it possible that they're psychically connected in some way, or that their souls have swapped bodies?
you know, I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but that's crazy.
right. It is. I'm listening to myself say it, and it sounds crazy.
then again, why not? It's almost Halloween.
it's true. My grandmother always said that the veil between the living and the dead got thinner around Halloween.
the only way to prove something like that...
would be if you found where the other body was, right?
Yes, and then I could talk to the ghost.
but I have searched the internet, and I can't find anything on Adam Godfrey's death.
I even checked with his publishers.
Oh, yeah? What did they say?
clueless. They didn't even know he was dead.
wait a minute. You didn't tell them, did you?
how I can I? I can't prove it.
tricky.
now, Steve Burris, on the other hand, I did find something on him. His obituary.
and he is nothing like Adam at all.
listen to this. A staple on the social circuit with a taste for luxury, adventure, and the good life.
and your guy was a hermit, huh? It's not as if their paths were to cross very often.
coming.
Hey, Jim. I hope it's not too late for visitors.
not at all.
Hey, Delia, come on in.
Oh, I'd love to, but I really just wanted to drop this book by on my way home.
it's a little dark, but guess I like that kind of thing.
me, too. Thanks.
you sure you don't want to stay? We're about to dig into dessert.
dessert? I'd die for something chocolate.
Oh, dear. It sounds great, but I really should get home.
Ned accidentally agreed to let me watch a movie that has no murder, mayhem, or violent explosions in it, so I'd like to watch as much of it as I can before he realizes his mistake.
boring.
OK, then. We'll see you tomorrow.
OK.
Hey! - Are you ok?
Yeah. Gosh, I'm such a klutz today. Bye.
can't I just see what's for dessert?
it's not like I'm worried about trans fats anymore.
wait a minute. Was she accompanied?
Yep. And her ghost is a chocoholic.
I really don't know what I'm going to do about that.
I knew it.
Hey, listen to this dedication.
to Jean, without whose loving support this book could not have been written.
sounds like a wife to me.
you know, he told me that he was alone-- always alone.
maybe she abandoned him.
you're a hopeless romantic, you know that?
OK. There is a Jean Godfrey who owns jean's pet shop in sunset park.
what do you think- man or a woman?
only one way to find out.
you know what? It's fun to brainstorm this stuff with you.
you know, I read somewhere.
ghost busting keeps a marriage strong.
Oh, I can't! No, I can't.
honey, are you all right?
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.
I just promised my husband that I wouldn't come home with something soft and fluffy and--oh.
Oh, yeah. Well, the reptile section's right over there, if that's any help.
actually, I am looking for a human being.
you're looking at her.
Oh, oh, hi. I'm Melinda Gordon?
are you related to the writer Adam Godfrey?
well, if being married to him counts as related.
he's your husband? - Was, long time ago.
I kept the name, though. So why do you ask?
I'm so sorry. He's dead.
Oh, ok.
Tony, could you take the counter, please?
let's talk outside.
sorry, but I really have to do this.
I'm not going to light it, I just go through the motions.
quitting's a bitch.
that's what I hear.
so Adam's dead.
how did it happen?
there was an accident. I don't have all the details.
you the girlfriend?
no. I just met him recently.
he told me that he'd always been alone.
well, I guess he kind of was, actually, even when we were married.
Yeah. It was really good at first. It was just...
he was kind of a hard guy to get close to.
so I assume you've read<Lost Delusions> .
it was pretty much the story of his life.
tortured young guy too smart for his own good, doesn't really fit in.
I guess I thought that I was going to be the one to bring him in from the cold.
you know what? Don't ever think that you can save those tortured young artists.
I think that they actually like being tortured. It's what makes them artists.
he was successful for a while, though, right?
Oh, yeah. When<Lost Delusions> came out, it was a big deal.
and then his second novel came out.
critics had a feeding frenzy.
Adam was devastated and he said he needed to move to the cabin to have some isolation to write.
at first, he came home every weekend, then once a month, and then there was the talk.
the one where you know it's all over.
if you want someone reliable, you get yourself a pet.
thanks for the advice.
Yeah. Thank you for letting me know about this.
Oh, man.
this is going to be really hard for Kate to hear.
Kate? - His daughter.
Yeah. Death can be hard to explain to children.
well, she's hardly a child. She's a junior at state U.
she hasn't seen or heard from her father since she was 3.
3? - She'd never admit it, but I think that she always thought that she'd see him again.
hell, maybe even get an explanation.
well, that's not going to happen now, is it?
well, thanks. I just...
I wanted to let you know.
what are you doing here? - I'm not sure.
I feel like I'm near something that used to be important.
I need to talk to you.
why didn't you tell me that you had a wife and daughter?
a wife and daughter?
no, I didn't have a wife and...
Oh, my god.
Jean and Kate.
Yeah, Jean and Kate, who you abandoned when she was 3.
why would I do that? - That's what I'd like to know.
all I know is I had a lot of demons. It was hard being around people.
I think I felt that I wasn't good for either of them.
so you ditched them?
no, I freed them to lead happier lives without me.
what? - That's classic.
you don't understand. - No, you don't understand.
how do you think your daughter felt when she had to watch you walk out of her life forever?
free? You're her father.
it was complicated. I'm not proud of it.
good,'cause you don't deserve to be happy.
you deserve to be exactly where you are-- in the wrong grave, doomed to listen to a woman grieve a good man, knowing that he isn't you.
so anyway, I'm standing in this alley, and I'm yelling at this ghost.
why did I let myself get so emotional?
not gonna read it, huh?
I don't want anything to do with this ghost.
why would I help someone who would run out on his family, abandoning his child?
whose family are we talking about now?
OK, I admit it, I have a personal thing going on here. So what?
so nothing. Just know where it's coming from.
and then he had the nerve to expect me to make it right for him.
in his defense, there aren't too many other people he could go to.
you're defending him?
I'm pointing out you're a little emotional right now.
I don't have to help every ghost that comes along. It's my call, right?
I mean, you've heard me tell ghosts to leave me alone.
only when you thought you couldn't help them.
you really think I can help this one?
Yeah, I do. And I think you do, too.
I can't talk about this right now. I have a headache.
Ooh, that's fabulous.
is it for sale?
Oh, no, I'm sorry. It's mine.
Lucy and Ethel would die for that bag.
may I?
Oh, sure.
there you go.
careful with that clasp, liberace. You trying to break it?
Ow. There must be a pin sticking out of it somewhere.
I don't see it.
OK. Thank you so much, and please come back again soon.
I will. You girls have great taste.
that really is a nice bag. I haven't noticed it before.
Yeah. I got it a couple of days ago at an estate sale.
Ah. That explains a lot.
you know, there are some figurines in the back. Could you go and get them for me?
you might have to dig around a little bit.
sure, no problem.
so it's the bag.
of course it's the bag. I don't even know that woman.
what's your name? - Marilyn Mandeville.
why are you the only one who can see me?
it's a long story. So how did you die, Marilyn?
I was at a charity event, one of those horrible things where no one can remember the charity, but they all sure as hell know where the photographers are.
well, I wasn't in the mood to be in the papers.
I knew I looked all red and blotchy from crying over luca.
Luca? - My boyfriend.
hot-headed, bad-tempered, just this much dangerous.
all the things I love in a man.
anyway, a friend told me that she saw him out with another woman, so...
I kicked him out of the house.
Aha. React first, ask questions later.
but I loved him.
anyway, I was just about to leave the party, when suddenly I saw him across the room.
he saw me, too.
he wrote something down on a napkin. He gave it to a waiter to give to me.
I tell you, my heart was pounding so hard, I thought everybody could hear it.
well, what did it say?
I didn't want to look desperate to read it.
so I tucked it in my bag.
I finished my drink and then I practically knocked over tables and chairs to get outside to read it.
but then...
you died.
heart attack.
I never got to read the note.
Marilyn, I hate to tell you this, but the chances of that note still being in the bag.
please, will you just check?
God! The interruptions in this place.
Shelby. Hi.
I just had to come by because the strangest thing happened to me.
you asked me if I knew a man named Adam Godfrey, right?
right.
well, he just called me. - What?
I was just about to have dinner when the phone rang.
I said hello, but all I heard was silence and a click.
I looked down at the caller I. D. And it said Adam Godfrey.
but didn't you say that Adam Godfrey died?
Yes, I did.
that's what I thought, so I wrote the number down.
Melinda, you may find this hard to believe, but I think your friend is trying to reach you from the afterlife.
I didn't think you'd come back.
I didn't plan to.
well, I'm glad you did.
I have one question and I want you to be really honest.
how do you walk away from your family?
you tell yourself your daughter will never feel the loss.
she won't miss you because she never knew you.
your wife will find love somewhere else and be better off.
you tell yourself that your work will be the thing that lives on after you, and that's what's important.
well, maybe you needed to learn this, Adam.
that guy whose grave I'm in...
he was really loved.
he must have been a good man.
Shelby thought so.
the woman who's been crying at his grave, the one you called to reach me.
I--I didn't call that woman. - You didn't?
who knew I could even use a phone? I'm dead.
does this number look familiar to you?
that's my phone number at the cabin.
do you remember where this is?
I think so. Why?
because somebody's in this cabin and I think we should find out who it is.
does this road look familiar to you?
no.
wait a minute... yes.
I was here.
it was late at night and my car had broken down.
no, wait a minute, I was out of gas.
the guy who picked me up, he seemed upset about something.
and I asked him about it, but he wouldn't talk, not until he heard my name.
turns out that he had read lost delusions 4 times, and so he wanted to know all about me.
I told him I lived in a cabin miles away from everything.
but I asked him about himself and he got tense.
"you wouldn't want my life," he said.
he didn't really know his way around, so we stopped at a bar.
I remember the bartender said there was a gas station 3 miles down the road, but my new friend said that he wanted a drink, and so did I.
he said he was a businessman who--who had the golden touch, at least until lately, and now things were going sour, he couldn't catch a break.
and he got some inside information about something, like a big merger.
gambled everything he had left on it, and it tanked.
now I remember. He said that his wife didn't know anything about this.
I can't tell her...
and he said he couldn't stand to see her have to give up the life that they had.
all that he had left was this insurance policy.
I'm worth more dead than alive.
this guy, he was so in love with his wife, and I just felt empty.
I never loved anyone like that.
did he tell you his name?
well, if he did, I don't remember.
do you think he killed himself?
looked like he was heading that way.
it was starting to rain, so I decided to cut my losses and walk.
help!
help me! Help!
what are you doing?
and that's how he became you.
that man, he was the name on my tombstone.
and I'm guessing he's in your cabin.
but why would he do that?
why would he throw away everything he had, the woman that he loved?
why not? It's what you did, wasn't it?
this is it? - This is it.
yes? - Who are you?
who are you? - I'm Kate Godfrey.
who are you?
my daughter.
you're Adam's daughter.
put it this way-- he's half the reason I was born.
second time, who are you?
sorry. Melinda Gorden. I live in Grandview, and I know your father.
you're the one that told my mother he was dead.
Yes.
well, that was helpful of you, considering it's not true.
what does that mean?
Oh, I'm sorry, can I come in?
it's not my place.
So...What makes you think that he's not dead?
no accident report, no body, no obituary.
do you want me to go on?
no, I'd look for them, too.
so not finding them it makes sense you think he's dead.
I know he is.
look, I know that this is gonna sound hard to believe。
I'm sure it will.
I've spoken to your father's spirit.
Oh, wow, you're one of those.
please believe me. It's true.
I know my father attracted some eccentric fans, but this takes it to a whole new level.
do you know much about your father?
no. I've never even read his books. - Why not?
it was the great god of literature that made him leave us.
frankly, I'm not interested.
Kate, your father gave me every detail about what happened to him the night that he died.
I'd be happy to tell you if you like.
do you know what I'd like? Is for you to leave me alone.
my mother tells me she hears from you that he's dead.
she asks me to come here and gather his effects, I come out here and what do I find?
a full fridge.
cigarettes in the ash tray. Newly opened mail.
dead, my ass.
I just hope I can get out of here before he comes back.
Kate...the man who's been living here, his name is Steve Burris.
there was a mix-up the night the night that your father died and he was mistaken for him, but your father is here now.
and he really wants to talk to you if he can just make some peace.
are you aware that you aren't even remotely believable?
Adam, please tell me something that Kate will understand. Help me.
just that she was such a beautiful child.
he thought you were so beautiful.
that's it? Oh, come on. Didn't you do your research?
the name of My Fuzzy Bunny, my favorite pet.
what about a cute nickname? Come on. Make me weep.
I--I can't.
he told me before that the only reason he left was to free you from having him as your father.
he didn't feel like he could give you what you needed, and that you would have a better life without him.
damn straight I did.
look, I know how you feel.
he did a terrible thing, and you've thought about him every day of your life with anger and resentment, I know.
you know? - Yes, I do know, but, Kate, for one minute, just--just imagine that what I'm saying to you is true.
that he's here and that he loves you and he feels really bad about not being in your life.
if you could tell him one more thing, what would it be?
I'd tell him to go to hell.
I'm so sorry.
don't be. She's right.
she did the only thing she could do.
she hardened her heart to me, she got on with her life.
there's no reason she should forgive me. No reason at all.
wow, you should have seen her. She was so bitter, so hard.
is that what I'm like when I talk about my father?
listen, everybody's gotta put the hard shell on, you know?
that means yes.
no, that means no.
you know, I can feel the hurt.
look, the good news is, you overcame the hurt.
helped somebody else and maybe, in the process, you helped yourself.
you always know the right thing to say.
I used to always know the right thing to say.
yesterday you wanted to bite my head off.
Oh...you were saying the right thing yesterday, I just didn't know it.
I can't sleep.
I'm Steve Burris.
are you gonna make trouble for me? I need to know.
you heard me talking to Kate.
I was on my way back from the mailbox when she drove up.
I stayed by the side of the house waiting for her to leave, and then you came.
that stuff you told her, how did you know all that?
Adam told me.
right. I heard that whole bit about how you talk to the dead.
come on, tell me the truth. How did you really know?
I wasn't lying. Adam told me about the night that he ran out of gas.
how you picked up, you told him about your money troubles, and you told him that you would be worth more dead than alive.
no one knew that.
he said he was killed in the storm, and that you stole his wallet so that you could fake your death. Now he's in your grave.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know what else to do.
I was on the verge of suicide, and...
when this happened, it seemed the only answer.
you found him.
he found me.
Adam's here now.
please...
if he's really here, make him understand I was desperate.
tell him I know, I've been there, but this isn't the way to go.
he says he understands, but this isn't the answer.
you can't just leave him in the wrong grave.
he has to hear Shelby crying everyday.
Shelby cries?
for me?
tell him he's lucky. I threw away the people who love me.
Adam only wishes he could have had what you have.
but he told me . he needed to be free. I understood that.
that's what I wanted, too!
no, it's not freedom, I was wrong.
he was wrong. He doesn't feel free. He feels...
very, very, sad.
and he wants you tell Shelby that you're alive.
I can't. She'll-- she'll never forgive me.
you gotta risk it. Look at all the other risks you took.
he says you have to risk it.
and tell him I forgive him for the rest.
and he forgives you for the rest of it.
he does?
he does.
Steve... she will, too.
you should feel good about what you said to him.
even if nothing comes of it, you're a good man.
that's nice of you to say, even if we both know it isn't true.
Melinda? Hi, I got your message.
Um...yes, there's something that I have to tell you.
OK, the night that Steve died, you said that he was alone, and that's not really true. It isn't?
how do you know?
my friend, the one that I was telling you about, Adam Godfrey, he was with him that night.
he was? But you said he's dead.
he is. He died that night.
but they only found one body.
I know. And it wasn't Steve's.
it was Adam's.
Melinda, what are you trying to tell me?
what I'm trying to tell you is...
what I'm trying to tell you is to look over there.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Steve!
you're alive!
Oh, Shelby, I missed you so much.
how is this possible? What happened?
Oh, my god, I'm seeing your face again! I love you so much!
Shelby, I have a lot to tell you. I've done something you're not gonna like, it's something bad.
there's gonna be lawsuits and trouble.
I don't care, I don't care!
as long as you're alive!
thank you.
in my version, he'd probably drop dead of a heart attack as soon as they left the cemetery.
I don't think so, I read your book.
you did?
I did. Last night, it was beautiful.
and I can understand why the writer would need to live alone.
I'm not sure I understand.
you need to forgive yourself a little.
she'll never come, will she? My daughter.
she'll never visit her father's grave.
you never know. - Yes, I do.
this is one story that won't have a happy ending.
look, Adam, I'm not your daughter...
but I guess you've noticed that I have some issues of my own.
but you know what? If I was as your daughter, I would...
I would find it in my heart to forgive you.
Why?
maybe it's because I read your book.
or maybe it's because I realize that everybody has their own story.
and you just don't know it.
so how's your story going to end?
happy.
it's all you can ask for, right, is a happy ending.
no...
don't tell me it really exists.
it does.
well, I'll be damned.
actually, that's not the idea.
but...why do i get to see it?
I mean, I pretty much failed on every level of my life.
because you found some peace.
at least a little bit. Am I wrong?
no. You're not wrong.
thank you.
you're very welcome.
Damn!
what happened?
I tripped over this bag again and I twisted my ankle.
stuff like that has been happening to me for the past 3 days.
well, maybe it's the curse of that pirate outfit you're wearing.
look, I am going to a great Halloween party. Do you want to come?
Ugh, no. I'm gonna go home, take a hot bath, and think about anything but ghosts.
you know, I don't get you. Ghosts and spooks are fun.
Yeah.
will you do me a favor?
sell this bag. Ever since I got it, I have had the worst luck.
I thought you didn't believe in anything like that.
Yeah, well, I don't. Just shows you how desperate I am.
I will be happy to sell it for you.
Hey, Delia, tomorrow why don't we close up and go to lunch together?
sounds good. - Happy Halloween.
about time. I thought I'd never get rid of that girl. Now, look inside.
I don't see a note. - Check the lining.
nothing.
there's a little rip in the lining. You have to feel around.
all right!
I found it!
Oh, I'm so sorry, Marilyn.
I don't you're gonna like what this has to say.
what? What does it say?
rip my heart out, why don't you.
he still loved me. Luca still loved me!
it's what we said to each other after every break-up when we got back together.
rip my heart out, why don't you.
it meant everything was going to be ok now.
Oh...I get it.
Oh, I really have to find him now.
Oh, let me stop you right there--you don't want to do that.
do you see a light?
Yes.
Yeah, well then, you should go into it and wait for him.
that could take a long time.
it won't seem that long. Trust me.
go. Wait for him to rip your heart out.
sorry! I ran out of candy a couple of hours ago.
Bye.
5 signs death will come...
my name is melinda gordon.
I'm married,
I live in a small town, and I own an antique shop.
I might be just like you.
except that from the time I was a little girl,
I knew that I could talk to the dead.
it's all right, honey.
earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.
they're stuck here because they have unfinished business with the living and they come to me for help.
in order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.
he sure is good-looking.
and he's completely unaware of it.
Bob has no idea of the effect he has on women.
and a sharp dresser. Check out the tie.
well, you know what they say - the clothes make the man.
and the dog.
this is amazing. I mean, I've heard a lot about therapy dogs.
how did you get him into it?
well, he's just always been so good with people, especially children.
he had to go through some training, but he's the perfect dog for it.
he's huggable. He's patient.
and you do this every weekend?
whenever we can.
this hospital was really great to my husband.
they did everything they could to try and save him.
everybody was really kind.
anyway, we have some more stops to make. Are you in a rush?
no. - Good.
Hey, bob! How ya doin', boy?
Ooh, nice tie.
notice how bob gets all the attention and we're just the appendages who happen to be nearby.
Oh, don't forget your donation for the silent auction.
Oh, I won't. I have so much stuff. Don't worry.
Oh, you know what? I forgot to ask her something.
can you please hold bob? Thank you so much. I'll be right back.
Oh. Ok. Ooh! Violet!
Bob- Ok.
let's go this way.
I'm sorry. - Oh, my god, I am so sorry.
my fault. My fault. Oh, gosh.
Oh, beautiful dog. May I?
Oh, yeah, of course.
Hey. Ohh...
are you all right?
I've just had a really tough day.
and he reminds me of a dog we used to have. Don't you?
is there anything I can do?
no. Thank you.
just enjoy your day.
I mean it.
enjoy everything.
friend of yours?
uh, new friend of bob's.
um, did she look familiar to you?
you know, I really didn't see her that well.
I swear I've seen her somewhere.
anyway, I need to use the restroom and then get going.
uh, they're through those double doors, I think.
OK. Bye, bob.
excuse me.
can I help you?
I'm looking for a rest room.
well, you won't find it here.
OK. Sorry.
let me show you.
it's right here.
thank you. - Oh, you're welcome.
Ahh.
can you see us?
I was looking forward to a nice toasty store.
it's freezing in here.
Oh, sorry. I just needed some fresh air.
I was feeling a little claustrophobic today.
is it ok if I close the door?
sure.
Hey, what's in the box
Oh, the donations for the hospital.
Ah! The silent auction. I totally forgot.
are you taking this in today?
Yeah. After work.
um, if I can get ned to bring everything by and it in the back of your truck?
Yes. I will add it to the haul.
excellent. Ned. Ned, I left everything in a bag by the door.
if you could just bring it by after school.
but I have volleyball practice.
that's at 4: 00. That leaves you 40 minutes.
it'll only take you 20.
OK.
Oh, thank you so much.
I know. It's a bummer. I'll see you after school.
I am gonna make myself some tea.
sorry.
are you ok?
Yeah. Uh...
nasty leg cramp.
Thanks.
so, 2 creepy visions, but no ghosts.
Yeah. Someone's trying to tell me something.
what?
I just keep getting this feeling like I can't breathe.
can't move.
why do they gotta make everything a riddle?
why do they gotta play these games with you?
they communicate with me the only way they can.
Yeah. Well, it makes it really hard to know what to do.
I'm gonna start with the obituaries, see if I can find any news stories on deaths in mental hospitals.
maybe that's why I was in a straitjacket in the vision.
that's a great way to spend the afternoon.
that's why god created coffee.
so, where do I put the stuff for this auction?
just right here on the table. That looks heavy.
did your mom make you throw out your video games?
Nah. It's just some random stuff.
need some help? - No, thanks.
obituaries. Whoa. Are we doing some ghost business?
we are not doing anything.
I just thought you might want to bounce some stuff off of me, since, well, you know, I know.
Thanks. That's sweet. But it's kind of a solo act.
whatever. I had volleyball practice anyway. But I'm on cell.
Hey, ned, wait a minute.
I knew you'd see it my way.
this is your dad's stuff, isn't it?
Yeah. So?
so, I'm surprised that delia would want to get rid of it.
are you-you sure that you grabbed the right box?
Yeah. That's the one. Definitely.
OK. Well, I'm not sure how much you're gonna be able to get for this hat.
Bye.
kinsella funeral home
no.
I'm listening, honey. I'm listening.
you have no idea how horrible it was.
I was using all my strength- my whole being just to even move my little finger and say that I was alive and that I could feel it.
honey, I still don't get it. I mean, the ghost was killed by an undertaker?
they thought he or she was dead, but he wasn't? They died in some kind of surgery?
the ghost was obviously feeling helpless.
there was stuff being done to it that it couldn't stop, that it didn't want, but what was I supposed to do about it?
all right, just tell me how this vision was different than your other visions.
you know, I mean, how you felt about it or something.
well, in this one I left my body.
like I died and I - I could see everything around me.
look, maybe this ghost, uh...
just wants people to know what happened to it.
you know, whatever it was, what he felt, if they were aware of it.
maybe you should check, see if anybody died in a funeral home, freak accidents, surgery.
do you feel it?
feel what?
do you feel anything on your back?
no, honey. What- there's
I don't feel anything. There's nothing.
mom help
what is it, mel?
what?
is this a new character in lemony snicket book?
do I look amused?
no. You look grumpy and mildly tired, yet oddly bewitching.
does it mean anything or not?
not. Is-uh- is it a secret code?
is it a sorority? Can you put it in context for me?
my husband's back.
as in a tattoo?
as in it appeared on his back as if someone was writing it and then disappeared.
Wow. You know how to put a slight spin on someone's day, don't you?
welcome to my world.
is there any way he can come into my office.
cause then maybe it would happen again and I could do some
no. I just need to know what it means, if it means anything.
I need more information. I'm sorry.
I'm trying to unravel a haunting.
it either has to do with a mental patient who died in an institution or somebody who died on the embalming table at a mortuary.
OK. There is actual hair standing up on the back of my neck.
would you like to feel it?
I will take your word for it.
look, professor payne
I just want you to know that it's not just me who took a chance when I told you what I could do.
the weird things that have been happening to you, the things that have been moved
things that are still happening.
this can really invade your life.
it's all right. I've been through worse. I was in a bar in Philly.
I'm serious.
well, maybe I've been waiting for something to invade my life for a long time.
maybe this is just what I needed.
I'm gonna go figure this out. I'll get back to you.
sure. - Thank you.
if I wanted to give this stuff away, I would have put it in the box myself.
ne then why didn't you?
Hey, I don't have to answer to a 13-year-old.
I'm your mother and you'll do what I say.
you always tell me I can be myself.
you had no right to take these.
what were you thinking?
these are your father's things, ned.
think I don't know that?
what is wrong with you?
I am so damn furious
I don't get it! What's the big deal?
Oh, you get it. And you know you get it.
you are just lucky I figured out what you were trying to do before it was too late.
Oh, god. I am so sorry you had to hear all that.
no, it's ok.
what happened?
I have no idea what's gotten into him.
I'm just gonna bring this all to the car.
so, ned, you want to talk about why you pulled such a loser move?
it wasn't a loser move.
OK, you want to come out here and tell me what's up?
what's up is, I'm sick of seeing mom sad all the time.
Ned, I don't think she's sad all the time.
that's because she's good at putting on a happy face.
try living with her.
she cries every single day about dad.
it's like she hopes he's still alive somewhere.
she just won't let him go.
say that again.
what?
the part about still being alive and not wanting to let him go.
so?
Ned, I really want to finish this conversation, ok?
you're in charge of the store. I'll be right back.
please stop it!
No!
please!
no. No. Please.
please don't. Please!
Aah!
please stop!
please stop!
found it.
Hi. Uh, I'm lost again.
do you know where I could find the coffee machine?
no.
well, you seem pretty sure about that, so...
great.
I got these out of the recycling bin.
Oh, thanks. Just dump 'em on the table.
can I help you go through these?
Thanks. But I have to.
you know, it's just that woman I saw at the bedside, she looked so familiar.
I know that I have seen her in the news.
maybe on TV?
maybe. But I think it was a magazine - some sort of family thing.
are you sure you found this ghost?
Yeah. Yeah. I saw his energy, I guess, hovering over the bed.
he was hooked up to all these machines.
there were wires all around him, just like I've been seeing in the visions.
how'd you find him?
it was actually something ned said.
do you remember last year when I had that ghost who was brain dead but he could only come to me when he flatlined?
well, it made me realize that this ghost may still be alive but trapped in his own body.
and he hates the things that are being done to him, but he still has a message he has to get across to me or someone else.
and it makes total sense with everything that I've been seeing and feeling.
it makes sense to me.
anyway, I think that he attached himself to me when I was at the hospital.
but how can you tell?
Oh! Hey! Wait. This is it.
this is the spirit.
he's been brain dead for months. There's a big court battle over it.
I read about that.
he had A. L.S.Right?
Yeah. Lou gehrig's disease. His wife took him to some mysterious clinic in europe.
he was in a coma right after.
well, rich family. Keeping him on life support, huh?
Yeah. Now his wife wants to pull the plug.
nice.
you know, he was only married for a month before he went into a coma?
the family thinks she just wants his money and that somehow she put him into this coma.
how are you gonna get to this guy? You said the family has guards.
they feel like they're under siege.
but I have a secret weapon.
Oh. Ok.
come on, bob.
are you kidding me?
Oh, he's a therapy dog. She met him a couple of days ago.
that's all right, ben.
I remember you.
Yeah. We were just making our rounds and I thought maybe you could use some company.
well, I don't know if he can go in there.
I'd have to check with the doctor.
but I could always go for a break.
do you want to go for a break?
OK. Is that good?
Oh! You lead.
you know, my husband doesn't even have a tie that nice.
gosh, there's nothing like some doggy love, huh?
and it gives bill a chance to talk to our son.
bill thinks it's important to talk to him.
you know, in case he hears us.
this must be such a hard time for you.
you have no idea.
come on, bob.
and then there are all the lawyers and the reporters.
I'm so sorry.
you must need your privacy in a time like this.
well, thanks to her, that's impossible.
come on.
you're being polite. I'm sure you've heard it all over the news.
I know there's a conflict.
you are polite.
I guess "conflict" is a good word for a wife who's trying to kill her husband
after having failed once before.
my son trusted her.
he said he loved her. But maybe that's just because we didn'T.
help them. Please.
help them.
then he said, "help them."
that's easy. Sounds like you're describing an astral projection.
that's an out-of-body experience?
or an O. B.E.As we pretentious experts like to say.
an energy body or an astral body carries the consciousness from the physical body.
and the energy would have to stay close to the physical body, wouldn't it?
well, that depends on how advanced the energy is.
some people say they travel to other planets where no doubt they have wonderful conversations about all this.
what about the silver cord?
umbilical cord?
keeps the soul tethered to the body, and if you...
cut that cord, you're going to be spending a lot of time with elvis. What's this all about?
turns out that my ghost is not a ghost. He's in a coma on life support.
whoa. Wait a minute.
he's-he's astral projecting at you?
that's one way to put it.
what does he want?
I think he wants to cut the cord once and for all.
you think this entity speaks latin?
I don't know. Why?
well, that message that was on your husband's back.
Ahem. Mors dilecti. It's latin.
why do you think it was written backwards?
you said this was written on jim's back, right?
well, maybe it was written from the inside.
do you know what it means?
do I know what I means? Me, the guy with "professor "in front of his name on the red door over there?
well? - Yes, I know what I means.
aren't you even impressed that I figured out the whole latin backwards thing.
I worked the mirror in- you have no idea what it means, do you?
I know what it means. It's the
it's roughly translated from latin, "the body of a crime,
the body or the proof - proof that a crime has been committed.
that makes no sense.
Oh, like a phantom writing on your husband's back makes sense?
will you just check it for me?
you wound me. - Bound to happen.
the first cut's always the deepest.
did anything else weird happen with your back?
no one's used it as a notepad today, if that's what you mean.
where are you?
I'm at the bristows' house.
I just want to see if I can talk to his wife.
Why?
I don't know.
just get her side of it, I guess.
I couldn't bring myself to tell his parents that I could see his spirit.
Ooh, here she is. I gotta go.
Bye.
Hi.
you just won't stop, will you? - I'm sorry.
you just won't leave me alone!
bastard! You no-good bastard!
you... leave... me... alone!
you want a story?
here's a story for you!
gold-digger wife!
stop it! Don't do that! - How's that?!
do you have to print that?
I'm not a reporter.
what are you? Detective, then?
a private eye mommy and daddy hired?
no. I'm just someone who wants to help.
you look- it's this simple.
hugh didn't want to be hooked up to machines.
he told me so.
OK. Well, did he put it in his will?
no. But he was my husband.
we talked. He told me things.
and I'm not going to let their big money and their big lawyers stop me from trying to do what hugh wanted.
you tell them that. tell them that I'm not give up
Hey.
Hey. What you doin'?
Oh, I'm just sorting some things. You?
nothin'.
I don't like to fight with you.
me neither.
maybe I should have asked you why you did what you did before yelling at you.
so I'm asking you now...
why did you want to get rid of all your dad's stuff?
it makes you sad.
it helps me remember.
it seems like the same thing.
sometimes remembering... does make you sad.
sometimes it makes you smile. Sometimes it makes you feel grateful.
sometimes it reminds you of...
the good life you had with somebody...
and all the things they gave you.
Ned, it's just a...
a big jumble of things. There's grief, there's joy, there's anger...
there are so many emotions, you just have to figure out a way to sort through them.
I don't know how.
well, I got a news flash for you.
neither do I.
neither does anybody.
you just have to work through it, feel the feelings.
just takes time.
how much time?
well...
all I can tell you is that every day it starts to hurt a little less.
does that mean I've forgoten about him?
Oh, no, kiddo.
you will never forget him.
and neither will I.
and having said all that...
I think you were right.
about what?
maybe I do hang on to too much stuff.
but
maybe if we gave some of it away - Not all of it, but some of it
it'll be like your dad's still out there making other people smile, not just us.
OK.
OK.
except...
I vote for letting go of the beer can cap.
my thought exactly.
all right, why don't you go get the box? It's in the back.
I'm going to take bob for a quick walk, ok?
Ooh! Sorry. I just had a few errands to
Oh-hey, no problem.
Ned and I have a few things that we want to donate to the hospital after all.
the box is a little lighter, but he's in the back getting it.
OK. Well, I'll take it by later.
Oh, it's ok. I can do it.
no, I have to go by there anyway. If you can do me a favor.
sure.
could I borrow bob again?
is there something going on between the two of you that I should know about?
he's really good company.
my wife is sure that hugh's coming back.
what about you?
I... wish I
I wish I could be so sure.
the doctors, they all say he's gone. He's been brain dead for months.
they say there's no chance, there's no...
chance my son's going to come back.
but jenna doesn't want to hear anything.
you know, that's still her son in there, and he's still breathing.
I just...
I just wish I knew if I was doing the right thing.
what about his wife?
she just wants the money.
that's why she married him.
she knew damn well how sick he was.
she was waiting tables. She didn't even go to college.
she doesn't love him the way we do.
but I don't want to keep hugh alive just to spite her.
would you mind...
can I sit with him just a few minutes?
no, I don't mind. Sure.
keep an eye on bob.
do you want them to end this?
I'm not meant to be here.
they're keeping me here.
are you suffering?
I feel like a prisoner.
well, did you tell lisa that you didn't want to be kept alive if something happened?
Oh, my god. She's got to know.
know what?
she's got to know what she did.
what did she do?
I've got to talk to them.
well, I don't know if I can.
no, please. You're my only chance.
I know, but is it really your business?
I mean, maybe you need to step away from this one and just
you know, just let it play out between the families.
they have rights.
it's not up to us to step in between and tell them what to do.
us?
all right, you.
I'm not telling them what to do.
it's-i'm supposed to help the dead with their unfinished business.
Yeah, but nobody's dead here. Now, what's the problem?
no, but his spirit still came to me, and he asked me for help.
I mean, that's what this whole thing should be about, not what his wife wants, not what his parents want.
it should be what hugh wants. He's the one who's laying there, wasting away.
you're absolutely sure this is what he wants?
Yeah. I have no doubts.
wouldn't you want the same thing?
wait a minute.
would you?
if I didn't think I would ever recover, yeah. Absolutely.
but... can you ever really be sure?
of course not. No more sure than you can be of what will happen when you walk out our front door tomorrow morning.
the only thing you can do is take all the information you have and give it your best shot.
I know that my best shot is in the light, not with machines or tubes or a hospital bed.
you have insider information. It's not fair.
so do you.
Yeah, I know.
it's just, you know...
if it came to you, it wouldn't be easy for me, that's all.
Yeah, but you'd do it because you love me.
and you know I'd be ok.
Yeah. I would.
and you?
if you're still here, hook me up. I'll take the machines.
I'll take a beating heart, if nothing else, just in case.
but if you go before me, don't even bother plugging them in.
I don't want to interfere in these people's lives.
and I don't want to get between them. But...
hugh bristow doesn't have anybody else to speak for him but me.
so I will.
so you should.
don't let them do this!
do what?
they're going to bring me back. Please, I'm gone already!
just tell them to let me go!
what just happened?
I think hugh just died.
and they brought him back.
you got brass ones, I'll give you that, to come here after last time.
just what is it you want?
I came here because I need you to trust me.
Why?
because I'm going to ask you to do something that isn't so easy.
why do you care about any of this?
I'm just trying to help.
do you believe the things they say about me in the papers?
should I?
hugh and I met 2 years ago in a diner.
I was his waitress.
the papers love to play that up.
for me it was love at first sight.
as we got more serious, hugh told me he had A. L.S.
a death sentence.
whatever time he had left, I wanted to share it with him.
he wanted to get married, but he didn't want to saddle me with his illness.
I loved him so much, nothing could have scared me away.
the wedding was so beautiful, not even his parents could ruin it, and don't think they didn't try.
they were sure I was only after his money.
his disease progressed more quickly than we expected, so we went to a clinic in switzerland.
then he went into the coma.
not the usual thing that happens with A. L.S.
so that's my side of it. Is that what you came here for?
no.
I didn't think so.
well, whatever it is you're up to,
I hope you don't think that you can hurt me.
not any more than they've hurt me already.
cause I'm pretty much bulletproof now.
I came here because I have a message from hugh.
when did hugh give you a message?
it's complicated, but I need to tell you at the hospital with bill and janet, all of you together.
no way. Uh...
I mean, even if I wanted to, they would never
it's something you're going to want to hear.
something everyone needs to hear.
you're going to be ok. We're going to bring you through this.
but you have to keep fighting, hugh.
you have to stay strong.
you've got to be kidding.
it's not your turn. We have another hour.
why did you bring her here?
I just want you all to listen.
OK? Just listen.
I have a message from hugh.
what are you talking about?
his spirit is here with us right now.
what is this?
what are you trying to pull?
I'm not trying to pull anything, and I'm not going to waste time on explanations.
there are some things that he wants you all to know.
I feel so much stronger just being close to him.
tell him I liked it when he read to me.
I just liked hearing his voice.
he wants you to know that he liked it when you read to him.
it meant a lot to hear your voice, especially when you read hemingway.
OK, that's enough.
you can't do this to us.
what is wrong with you? Do you not think we have suffered enough?
tell her I know what happened.
he knows what happened.
and tell her it's all right.
he's saying it's all right.
what? What happened?
he's saying something about medication.
did you give him pills?
no. This is some kind of a trick.
he's saying that it's all right and he forgives you, and so will they.
I took care of my son.
I know how to take care of my son.
I was afraid that she had done something to him in switzerland.
hugh went into a seizure.
so I-I gave him... muscle relaxants.
which ones?
the ones I always gave him when he seized.
the doctors took him off those.
they said they would interact with his antidepressants.
how could you give them to him without telling me?
he seized and I.
I had to do something.
that was when he went into the coma.
wait. He doesn't want to blame anyone.
he just wants you all to stop this.
bill, this is all my fault.
she's right.
look what I've done- I've killed him!
he's saying none of this matters now.
he just wants you all to stop hating each other and let him go.
but if this is true, if he really is here, then he's aware of what's going on. How can we end his life?
I am aware, mom.
I'm aware that I'm not coming back.
and I will continue to be trapped here until these machines stop living for me.
he is aware.
he can see you and he can feel you, but he knows that it's his time to go, and he's not living.
these machines are doing it for him.
he's my son.
no.
I can't let him go.
mom, you want me to stay here for you, not for me.
he says that he thinks you're wanting him to stay for your sake, not for him.
and keeping him here, it's only making it harder on everyone.
mom...
I need you to heal.
I want you to love lisa.
she's all alone now.
she needs you.
what's happening?
tell lisa I know that she loved me.
I knew it was for real.
I felt her tears on my shoulders and on my back.
she didn't want me to see her crying.
tell her I know how hard she fought for me.
he knows how much you loved him.
he was talking about the night that he felt your tears...
Jim? - Shower.
Ooh. That's a good idea. Is there room for me?
it can be arranged, I think.
is it raining where you are?
Oh, professor payne.
no, it's a shower.
you know what? That's a lite too much information.
uh, actually, it's not enough information.
well, that's all you're getting.
you're cruel, but you knew that, didn't you?
no, cruel would be if I run out of hot water.
what can I do for you?
I know you may find this difficult to believe, but I may have made an error.
I find it shocking that you're admitting it.
what's your error?
that latin translation I gave you
it seems my linguistics are a bit rusty.
Oh. Well, no worries. It's all taken care of.
game over for now.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
what do you mean?
the phrase mors dilecti it does not mean "body of the crime" after all.
so what does it mean?
it means...
it means somet ngentirely different, melinda.
what?
what does it mean?
it means "the death of a loved one."
honey, you coming or not?
we're getting ready.
for what?
for what's coming.
he's been planning this for quite some time.
we're blocking the light.
no, this is bigger than just him.
it's time for you to know who you are.
and to know who your brother is.
he said I have a brother.
who said this? Who told you that you have a brother?
my father.
I don't think so.
definitely a concussion.
so she may feel confused or a little dizzy.
we're talking about an injury that's only a couple of days old, so.
long-term?
barring any second impact, she'll be fine.
really.
look, just hang out, you know, until I make sure the pictures are ok, then you can go.
Thanks, doc.
no problem.
are you ok?
Yeah, I'm just tired.
I almost lost you up in that field.
if it wasn't for those kids.
I don't know if I could ever thank them enough.
we gotta talk about this.
what is there to talk about?
I told you everything that I saw.
Yeah, but what does it mean?
do you really think it was your father in the light?
if he's dead, I have to find out what happened.
and if he was telling the truth.
that you have a brother.
what if it is Gabriel?
well, then we'll deal with it.
he hasn't been anywhere in Grandview.
he's disappeared again.
Oh, Melinda Jim, sorry.
we'll have to take those X-rays again, there was some kind of exposure problem.
it'll just take a second.
so, John, let's just reset and we'll do that first series again.
then start with the next three.
I'll give you a hand.
that was the best concert I ever went to.
Hi, mom, it's me.
um, I just got back from the doctor and everything looks good.
I do need to talk to you, though.
it's kind of important, so call me.
Bye.
here, it's been in and out of so many attics and basements. I've lost track.
I was gonna just chuck it, but.
Oh, never chuck. Chucking is bad.
look.
well, there's a lot of cool stuff, I guess.
are you kidding? This stuff is great.
Yeah, it all belonged to my father.
are you sure that you want to part with this?
I mean, it all looks pretty personal.
Oh, yeah, yeah, you know, my parents died when I was pretty young, so I didn't really know them.
I don't even know most of the people in those pictures, so.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, don't be. Don't be.
I don't spend much time in the past.
I work in one direction, and that's forward.
so how does this work? Like consignment?
Yeah, we'll inventory everything, get some prices, figure out how we want to present it, and then we'll call you when things start to move.
great, that's awesome.
um, let me give you my number.
Oh, great.
just ask for Jennifer Billings.
here you go. - Thank you.
and talk to you soon?
Yeah, probably by the end of next week.
great. Thank you.
Thanks.
what's up with you?
nothing.
Hey, why don't you take the trunk downstairs, and then I can do the inventory on it later.
OK, well, just let me go through these returns and then I'll bring it down.
Yeah, why don't we just get it out of the way, you know?
just bring it downstairs, and that way no one will look through it before we're ready.
are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just trying to get everything organized.
surprise!
come on!
in recognition of your heroic acts, which saved the lives of many of Grandview's children, the town council presents you with this plaque.
I don't know what to say.
I don't really want to say anything.
Thanks, everybody. Melinda really appreciates it.
let's have some cake, ok?
all right!
OK, can I just, uh, get one with everybody?
can you get me out of here?
I gotta go to work.
how about you? Lunch?
if it's a lunch that involves food, yeah, I'm in.
you know, that night when I thought you died, I mean, I thought you died right in front of me.
every feeling inside of me just dropped.
all of them.
all the things I wish I could have said to you, I was never going to be able to say to you.
did we get the check? - Yeah.
Oh, good. That is mine. I asked you.
OK, well, in that case, I'm still hungry.
so what do you think me seeing this door means?
I mean, it had, like, a viewport and I could hear strange noises coming from behind it, like, wood falling and beams crashing.
sounds like me doing home repairs.
what could it symbolize?
well, doors usually mean endings or beginnings.
certain mythologies believe that the way to the truth is by choosing the right door.
or maybe that's a game showing I'm thinking of.
something else weird happened to me at the doctor's.
there was a face behind mine in the X-ray.
do you think it was your father?
I don't know.
even your X-rays are haunted.
that's hardcore.
when was the last time you saw your father?
when I was 11.
Ouch.
ahem, what about Gabriel?
nowhere to be found.
which proves that this town is too small for 2 people that see ghosts.
right now I'm just gonna concentrate on what happened to my dad.
how are you going to do that?
guess I have to talk to my mother.
if she's calmed down enough since the accident.
well, don't you think she would have told you if she saw him?
not necessarily.
my mom has spent her whole life trying to deny that she could see spirits.
I just found out she could see them 2 years ago.
she hates talking about my father, and she hates talking about anything that has to do with her real feelings.
so it should be a productive visit, all in all.
some kind of family, huh?
you should see mine.
all they want to do is talk about their feelings.
and never the happy ones.
I guess we all have our haunted X-rays, one way or the other.
what?
do you see that?
I don't see anything.
what-- what is it?
I'm not sure.
uh, I gotta go.
Yeah, I'll call you later.
OK.
I'm just asking, when is the last time you saw dad?
I don't remember.
mom, come on.
I'm serious.
I barely think of him if I can help it.
I know, but this is important.
Why?
would you know if anything happened to him?
what are you talking about?
I think dad's dead.
how do you know that?
because I saw him.
when I was.
when I died on the field.
why didn't you tell me this before?
I'm telling you now.
and he said I have a brother.
this is the second serious head injury you have had.
no, don't you do that!
I am sorry, I'm just saying that it is possible that your mind is creating all of this.
mom, would you please stop it?
I know what I saw and what I heard.
now, I am being haunted by someone or something and I think it has something to do with him, because he's trying to tell me something.
tell you what?
I don't know.
but I-- I think it has to do with the underground.
I don't know what you want from me.
I want you to talk to me.
OK?
do you think that he's dead? Do I have a brother?
if you're asking me did I have a second child, no.
and far as your father goes, how would I know?
he walked out on us years ago.
it's not exactly like he kept in touch.
have you seen him?
his spirit?
no.
mom, is there something that you're not telling me that could help?
do you know where he was living?
what's the last thing that you remember about him?
the last thing I remember about him is how hard you cried when he left.
for days.
don't romanticize him, Melinda.
he doesn't deserve it.
Hey, what's this?
I had a customer today who's looking to sell a trunk of old stuff.
it made me think of my old stuff.
maybe there's a clue in here, something I missed.
how'd it go with your mother?
full metal lockdown, as expected.
look at you.
Oh, how beautiful.
those eyes.
I just keep looking at him, thinking, "What is underneath that smile? What does he know, and if he's trying to tell me something right now, then why doesn't he just come to me and tell me?"
am I being obsessive?
Yeah, but with good reason.
your father dying's a big deal, no matter how you felt about him.
my dad was always this villain in my life, and now, all of a sudden, he's gone, or at least physically gone, and, I don't know, I just feel like there's this big hole.
you didn't really think he was gonna come back, did you?
I used to fantasize about it when I was a kid.
you know, that he'd show up one day after school and have this explanation of why he'd left.
you know, like he'd been kidnapped by spies and they'd burned all the letters he was gonna send to me and then he'd finally escape and fought his way back to me.
that's funny. Your mom thought you might romanticize him.
you know, it's hard to deal with the truth about our parents.
that moment you discover that they're just people, flawed people, it's painful.
flawed is a kind description of my dad.
but, still, if he would have just come back.
I would have believed anything he said to me.
and I could have forgiven him for anything, you know?
I just.
I wanted my dad.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry he hurt you so much, but.
think about it this way-- you have this beautiful heart, and he couldn't do anything to change that.
that was kind of heavy.
Yeah, I'm kind of exhausted now.
are you gonna come to bed?
Yeah, soon.
No!
it was you!
it was you!
it's all right. You're ok.
there's nothing there.
Jim saw this, too?
no, he heard me yelling, and by the time he came out, everything was back to normal again.
what?
nothing.
do you think I'm making this up?
no, I do not think you're making this up.
I'm trying to wrap my mind around it.
it's just.
you know- - hard to believe.
a little, I guess.
well, at least you're honest. Gotta love that.
OK, so you think your dad is connected to all this somehow.
Mmm, I'm not sure, but I won't know until I figure out how he died.
and your mom was no help?
that would be a no.
and every time I go online, I get thousands of hits.
apparently, Tom Gordon is a very popular name.
is there anything I can do?
you're doing it.
thanks for listening to the rantings of your very weird and haunted friend.
not to cut short said rantings.
um, do you mind if I go meet Ned at the dentist?
no, go ahead.
Thanks.
Hey, you want anything?
Ooh, a muffin.
Oh, healthy or disgusting?
mild disgust.
that's my girl.
Oh, hello. Feel free to browse.
let me know if I can help you with anything.
you don't remember me?
uh, no. I'm sorry.
I was the one taking pictures the other day when you got your little plaque.
right.
what were the pictures for?
and Shame the Devil.
I'm sorry?
and Shame the Devil, the blog.
Oh, right, yeah.
all the dirt on Driscoll County.
my husband loves that blog.
you write for it?
I'm it.
shame the Devil?
Yeah, it's like from an old proverb.
you know, "tell the truth and shame the devil."
right.
Shakespeare Henry IV.
um, yeah. Anyways, I have something I want to show you.
these are the pictures I took the other day.
now, I remember everybody who was there.
I got a quote about you from each person.
but this dude.
this dude I do not remember, and he only shows up for like a second, and he's not in any other shots.
well, maybe it's a, it's a reflection from somebody walking by outside.
a reflection?
are you serious?
OK, a light ray on a reflective surface is always reflected at angle equal to the incident angle.
and the angle of incidence is totally equal to the angle of reflection.
and if, and only if
OK, you know what, moving on from the whole reflection idea, maybe it's just somebody that we didn't see.
Yeah, but it gets weirder.
Really?
Yeah, I enhanced these and turned then into negatives to get a better contrast.
check this out.
would you send me these?
Yeah.
are you sure this isn't a reflection?
Yeah, I can say that I'm reasonably sure that is not a reflection.
maybe it was someone that was there but you forgot they were there
OK, it's a ghost, get over it.
sweet!
I mean, that's great.
that's photographic evidence.
but, wait, why didn't you see this on the day?
I don't know.
why is he so dirty?
what, you think?
I don't know what to think.
I mean, the height and weight, I guess, is sort of similar.
maybe.
I mean, would your father have a reason for being this dirty?
was he secretly a chimney sweep?
all right, I just.
all I know is that all these hauntings have something to do with things underground.
you know, like, spirits rising from the depths.
Oh, I hate spirits rising from the depths.
don't get me started!
What'd you tell the blogger kid about this?
I just played dumb, but I don't really think he's gonna let it go.
especially after he showed me this.
what do you think it is?
a straight, serious answer, please.
I got nothing.
all of these creepy things around my head, this, the man's face in my X-ray.
hold on a minute.
is that shadowy thing on your face all the time?
or.
were they just there on the day that it happened?
I don't know.
ay, ok.
look, I'm going to, uh, get a shot of you, and then I'll add the same enhancements that the blogger kid did, then we'll see if that stuff is still on your face, ok?
OK.
all right.
say, "spirit rising from the depths."
have a good night.
good-night. See you tomorrow.
you killed her.
you killed her!
wait, so now you're saying it's not your father haunting you?
I saw the ghost, and it's definitely not my father.
and I saw the trunk in the haunting last night.
how can that be? It's a solid object.
it hasn't moved since I went through it.
I don't really worry about the physics of it.
I just see what they show me.
which means the ghost is attached to this trunk.
OK, um.
here.
this is the ghost that's been haunting me, and it's not my father.
it's Jennifer Billings' father.
but why?
I think he's got me confused with someone else.
who?
don't tell me you sold it already and now you want more.
Oh, I would love more, although we haven't even put it on display yet.
sometime this week.
I still can't believe that you're willing to part with it all.
Yeah, well, like I said, it just feels like it's somebody else's life, you know?
you know, I was looking through the pictures, and I saw your father.
or at least, I'm assuming he was your father?
Yeah.
Yeah, he was a handsome dude.
the thing is, I think it's possible that I've met him.
Oh, no.
no, he, uh, died in 1982.
sorry.
do you mind if I ask how?
Why?
well, I don't mean to pry, it's just when I was looking at the photos, there was something familiar to me, that maybe I'd, you know, known him somehow.
well, it was a work.
there was an accident.
I was 5, so I don't really remember much.
what about your mother?
she died the same day.
I was an instant orphan.
just add water and new parents.
the state took me, but I was really lucky.
I was adopted right away.
dimples or something, I don't know.
he really loved you.
what?
your father. I could see it in the pictures.
how could they have loved me?
they-- they really didn't even get a chance to know me.
the way he was smiling.
and the way he was holding your hand.
beaming, really.
why are you doing this?
I'm sorry, I didn't
um, Fred, could you just take the counter for a second?
I'm on it.
Hey, Jennifer!
Jennifer, I am so sorry.
no, no, no, it's just, god, welcome to my pity party, you know?
Oh, I just hate crying.
it's hard to get through life without a few tears.
Yeah.
well, let's just say I frontloaded all of mine.
have you always had the trunk?
I got it when I was 18.
they put it in a trust for me, even a little bit of money.
it's funny.
I can remember their voices so clearly.
I can remember lying in bed at night and listening to them and feeling just so safe, but I couldn't, um, I couldn't remember their faces.
but you saw the pictures in the trunk.
Yeah, yeah.
I just.
I never found one of my mother.
there's the one of me and my father, that one picture, that one where his big, beefy hand is holding mine like a fragile little twig.
and this is gonna sound crazy, but.
sometimes I swear I can feel that.
you know? I can feel his hand take mine like, out of nowhere.
doesn't sound crazy.
not really.
look, I just need to know.
did your dad die underground?
he worked for the gas company.
he died in the street cave-in down on the town square.
Cave-in?
I-- I've gotta go.
no, please, is there anything else that you remember?
I remember his voice the night before he died.
he was talking to my mom in the kitchen, and he was telling her how much he hated it down there.
he said he thought it was haunted.
what can I do for you?
uh, I was just looking for some information about something.
information on what?
I go on lunch in 5 minutes.
Yeah, he's always like that.
don't let him intimidate you.
uh, it's actually about something that happened 25 years ago.
And?
and I was told to come here.
look, this isn't a library.
we're still trying to get things computerized.
put your request in writing, give me 2 to 3 weeks, I'll see what I can do.
it's unbelievable. This guy is just the laziest son of a bitch on the planet.
I mean, if I were still working here
you're not.
um, this is actually a specific event.
like, 1982.
I can go and find it if
name, address, date you're looking for, phone number
see you in 2 to 3 weeks.
Yeah.
right.
I knew I liked you.
he's going to lunch.
you have to help me find something.
Yeah, well, good luck finding anything in this place.
why is it such a mess?
Ah, it's not like they don't try.
even the lazy guy.
but somehow, things just end up getting messed up anyways.
of course, no one knows this archive like me.
what are you gonna do?
Yeah, whatever.
I just have to find anything that I can on the street collapse of 1982.
you think that's how it works?
you just snap your fingers and we do your bidding?
what?
they told me that you might come around here.
asking questions.
who told you?
you are so.
over your head.
if I were you, I would leave.
now.
and I really wouldn't come back.
ever.
daddy!
why did you leave?
I had to go, honey.
it didn't mean I wanted to.
I missed you so much.
did you miss me?
every day.
I knew it.
why did you leave us?
you'll understand someday.
why won't you help me now?
because you have to find out for yourself.
you always used to give me a hint.
with every riddle, you'd give me one hint.
please.
OK.
but just one.
age 15.
what does that mean?
you already know.
I have to go now.
No!
dad, wait.
don't go.
you were told to stay away, weren't you?
I don't take orders from ghosts!
Oh, but.
he is very angry with you, this one.
he wants to take you down with him.
I think I'll let him.
you know, there are a lot of very angry people down here.
I think it's time I let you meet them.
I'm not afraid of you.
I am not afraid of you!
you will be.
gas explosions rip Grandview
mom, I asked you point blank if there was anything you were holding back from me, and you said no.
how could I possibly know that that one incident would mean anything to you?
how about the fact that you lived in Grandview?
did you think that that was going to mean anything to me?
it was a long time ago.
it didn't matter.
of course it matters.
I've been in Grandview for, like, 3 years and you never told me that you and dad lived there!
I mean, what else are you hiding?
nothing.
how did you get this?
I was led to it.
by who?
by dad.
somehow he's been helping me.
OK, I see.
so he gets to be the hero, and I am the evil mother.
well, at least somebody is pointing me towards the truth.
it was a very painful time in my life.
is that what you want to hear?
is that the truth you want to know?
you were only a few years old.
we had been there less than a year.
I got out.
I never wanted to think about it again.
why not?
what other secrets are you hiding?
nothing.
you have to talk to me.
OK, you were with this guy the day that he died.
what else do you know about him?
why is he haunting me, and why is he accusing me of letting someone die?
he still thinks it's 1982.
he thinks you're me.
what?
I killed his wife.
mom, what the hell are you talking about?
your father and I had just moved to Grandview.
I knew that I had this ability to do this thing.
I was trying to avoid it, block it
OK, mom, stop.
tell me what happened.
I was running errands.
I was still trying to get to know the town, to get to know the people.
there was a gas line break.
it happened deep under the ground.
somebody help!
everybody's dead down there!
help! Please!
I'm ok, I'm right here!
you see me?
you hear me?
no, I can't.
please.
am I dead?
please, please.
talk to my wife for me.
she can't hear me. Please!
I have to talk to her!
excuse me.
just tell her I'm right here.
your husband
my-- my husband?
you've seen my husband?
I'm right here.
Yes, he's.
I just couldn't tell her that her husband was a ghost.
he's right here.
she thought I'd meant he had made it out of the explosion.
where? Is he all right?
Jennifer, stay here.
she ran towards the hole.
I-- I should have stopped her.
she got too close.
mom, there's no way you could have known.
I've never learned to deal with them.
not the way your grandmother could, the way you do.
I just can't stand to feel their pain.
it stops me cold.
you feel their pain, and you help them anyway.
is that why you left Grandview?
there were a lot of reasons.
I can make this right for you.
no.
just leave it alone.
just leave me alone.
professor Payne?
who wants to know?
um, I'm Justin Yates.
I'm in the emerging technologies program.
I was actually...
actually, I've been to some of your lectures on the paranormal
you had me at "um."
what can I do for you, Justin Yates?
I, uh, I run And Shame the Devil.
the blog?
Yeah. Ok, cool, so you know it.
Yeah. You have that rate your professor page.
scattered and distracted.
that's what I remember reading about me.
OK, uh, I'll make this quick, then.
I just, uh, wanted to show you this image I took the other day.
what do you think?
I think I look scattered and distracted. Darn.
no, um, I mean-- I mean this.
dude, he's like not there in every other picture, and he just randomly appears in these two!
Justin, I'm not one to stand on ceremony, but if you call me "dude" again, I'm gonna have to bounce your head off of one of these walls.
sorry.
you don't think this picture means anything?
no. I don't.
you know, uh, I've been asking around about that antique chick, Melinda.
people say a lot of weird stuff happens in that store.
well.
weird stuff happens all the time.
everywhere. Doesn't it?
maybe you have to get your nose out of the computer screen to learn that.
I have a book for you.
I'll tell you what, Justin.
I'm gonna do you a big favor today.
I don't know how much reading you do without scrolling, but they did at one time print words on a page.
here you go.
this book's gonna change your life.
awesome.
when you die, it's like time stops moving for you.
especially when there's a lot of anger.
it's like you're caught in some kind of loop.
I just wanted to say good-bye to her, to my daughter.
why couldn't your mother, why couldn't she do that for me?
she doesn't really accept what she can do.
but she didn't mean to hurt anyone.
your wife was frantic looking for you.
I keep wondering if she suffered.
what she felt.
what her last thought was.
I'm sure it was you.
why can't I find her?
well, if you didn't see her right away after she died, she probably crossed over.
and that's a good thing.
she went into the light.
I didn't see any light down there.
what did you see?
your daughter's-I saw things.
I heard things.
it's terrible there underneath.
I don't ever want to go there again.
Yeah, but what did you see?
wait.
my daughter.
she. 25 years.
she's a grown woman now.
you can feel her.
that's probably why you came back from the underground.
there's only one thing left for you to do.
he wants you to know your history, where you came from.
who the people in these pictures are.
he wants you to know your family.
that's when she was 4.
it was taken at mt. Kisco.
her mom loved it there.
this was taken at mt. Kisco.
it's one of your mother's favorite places.
and that's her uncle Jerry.
he used to come home from Florida once a year, and he'd always bring her those funny sunglasses.
this is your uncle Jerry.
he lived in Florida, but he would come visit once a year, and he gave you those funny sunglasses.
how could you know this?
how do you know?
it's a long story.
let's finish this first.
OK.
tell her to go to the last page of that album.
he wants you to go to the last page of this album.
it folds out.
you were 3 months old in that picture.
your mom couldn't keep her eyes off of you.
um, you were 3 months old in this picture.
and your mother could not take her eyes off you.
ray Billings crossed over.
he understands what happened.
he doesn't blame you anymore.
I know what you think of me.
that I'm wrong to try and shut this out.
I don't judge you, mom.
I just want the truth from you.
it's the only thing you owe me, that we owe each other.
you want the truth?
you need to leave Grandview.
what? Why?
it'll hurt you.
it's not a good place for people like you and me.
no, mom.
I'm not running away, not from what I can do and not from where I make my life.
I knew you wouldn't.
you know, don't even call this a short walk going for two miles next to the forest march
all right, we go to the base camp I give you a nice massage
Hey, how nice is nice how long would me marry you to get there?
what's the man doing in our tent?
who's that?
I don't know.
wait a minute. Is she a -
no, she's not a ghost. She's real.
she's a young girl.
but doesn't she look kind of...
Yeah. Something's not right.
there's not another campsite for miles.
Oh, we scared her.
no, wait!
wait a minute!
wait!
we don't want to hurt you!
we just want to help!
wait! Don't.
it's all right. Take it easy, ok?
let me see your leg. I'm a paramedic.
I can help you.
let me just look at your leg, all right?
it's nothing.
it just needs to be cleaned and dressed.
Hey, uh, tell us your name.
you must be pretty scared, huh?
are you in these woods all alone?
tell you what. I'll make you a deal.
you come back with us to our camp, ok?
get warm, have a good meal.
I'll split this with you.
OK. You can have the whole thing.
it's ok.
it wasn't very deep at all.
it should heal quickly.
you know, we really want to help you, but you have to tell us a few things first, like...
what's your name?
where are your parents?
are you lost?
maybe if we talk to child services back in town, they could give us some information
your name's Becca? - Yeah
OK.
Becca, so...
what are you doing here?
are you hiding from something?
I ran away.
what did you run away from?
your parents?
I don't have any parents.
they're dead.
do you live in a foster home?
how long have you been out here?
2 or 3 weeks.
we need to find out where that foster home was so that we can let them know you're all right.
no.
please. I don't want to go back there.
well, we're going to do the best we can to keep you safe, but we need to let the police know that we found you.
don't make me go back there.
I'm begging you.
you know, we don't get any cell service out here, and if we try to hike to the car, it would be dark before we get there, so...
OK.
you're going to stay here with us.
we'll keep you safe.
I won't let you leave me.
what's going on?
what's happening to me?
Hey, look at me, There's nothing here.
you're all right.
she's mine.
Becca, I know that you don't really feel safe, but trust me, you are.
I think the best thing for you is just to get a good night's sleep.
I can't.
well, then, let's talk.
do I have to?
I know that this is going to sound strange...
but have you lost any friends or family lately?
Why?
I'm just trying to understand why you're out here.
they hurt me. I left.
I'm not going back.
OK.
why these woods?
how have you been living out here all this time by yourself?
I'm tired.
I'm going to go back to sleep.
wait. Um, can you hang with me for a minute, just till I fall back asleep?
of course I will.
Hey, I didn't know you were so good with teenage hard cases.
well, it helps that I used to be one.
you? Come on.
Yeah. You remember that age.
you're always mad at your parents 'cause they didn't understand who you were.
well, take all that, add ghosts, and stir.
do you think that's what happened to Becca?
or maybe she was abused?
I don't know.
what did the ghost say about her?
he just said "she's mine."
well, maybe he could be a friend or a brother who was also abused.
could be.
well, I guess we'll find out when we know where she belongs.
what if we're just taking her right back to the thing she's running from?
don't really have a choice.
honey.
no. Wake up.
Becca's gone.
what?
I left this in my backpack.
she must have found it in the tent.
OK. So where could she have gone?
I don't know. Wherever she went, she's staying, cause she took most of the food.
Oh, no.
what?
my car keys.
what?
just watch out. She might get some traction.
Becca, stop it!
I'll try get this side
you can't go. I need you!
I won't let you go!
go away!
leave her alone!
get out of the car-- right now.
get out of the car.
you could have killed yourself.
what were you thinking?
you saw him, too.
you can see ghosts.
so, we'll go downtown later and see if we can get some things that fit better.
so you're not going to call the police or whoever?
eventually, but if you need some more time, for now...
do you need some help with that?
I know how to use a brush.
you know, when my grandma first told me that she could see ghosts,
I should have said,"thank god."
you know, there's finally someone else like me.
all I could say was,"what is wrong with my grandma?."
it might be something you have to get used to.
so, you said that you were hurt by people.
mostly with words?
Yeah, mostly.
who?
my foster parents.
what happened to your real parents?
they died in a car crash.
how old were you when they died?
I guess I was, like, 5 or 6.
how old were you when you started seeing ghosts?
I don't remember ever not seeing them.
what did you say to your parents after they died?
after they died?
I never saw them.
your parents didn't die, did they?
and you don't have foster parents.
you made it all up.
look, you can tell me the truth.
if you do, I can help you.
and if you don't, then you're going to go back home, and nothing's going to be
they think I'm sick.
they take me to the doctors and they try to make me take pills.
OK. So then, we'll make them understand.
it won't work.
well, you can't live in the woods forever, and you don't have to.
know how to make the ghosts go away?
I know something better.
Yeah, mom. I'm fine. I promise.
I don't know. Just, like, some cuts and stuff, but he's, like, an ambulance guy, and he says I'm fine. So...
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.
they'll be here tomorrow afternoon.
they live in a small town outside St. Louis.
well, what happens now?
well, they just talked to the grandview police, who said nice things about us, thank goodness, so I guess she'll stay here until they get here.
how did she get that far from home?
cause she's a smart girl.
she took a bus 5 or 6 days and then got off here in Grandview.
OK. And how about this
another person who sees ghosts chooses Grandview.
why does that keep happening?
I don't know, but I don't have time to think about it.
right, cause you got a ghost to cross over.
no, she does.
I have 24 hours to teach that girl everything I know.
has you been in a touch since you left home?
no, we meet in the forest.
but the thing to remember is that they're more scared and confused than you.
they're stuck here, for some reason, and most of the time, they don't even know why.
and after you've figured out why they've stayed earthbound, you can help them, take care of them.
and they can cross over.
cross over?
Yeah. Into the light.
so, how do you know it's a better place?
you ever been there?
no, but I've felt it.
there's peace there, and knowing that I gave them that, there's nothing better.
Hey. You must be Becca.
I'm Delia.
it's ok, honey. I won't bite.
I hear that you are a very special girl.
uh, you know what? There's some really cool vintage dresses over there.
why don't you take a look?
Melinda, you know that I believe that you do amazing things.
I have seen you change people's lives again and again.
but this-- - what?
do you really think the best way to help this girl?
is it to give her a crash course in being you?
Delia, she's not just running away from her parents.
she's running away from ghosts.
can't you teach her how not to be afraid?
I can't stop her from seeing them, which means that I can't stop them from going to her with their problems.
have you ever tried walking around with a crowd of dead people following you?
it's not fun.
didn't you say your mom had this gift, and she lived with it?
trust me, that is not a good argument.
Yeah. I'll be right there.
look, I had my grandmother, ok?
Becca has no one but parents who don't understand.
I have to teach her how to cross them over.
I'm not going to let her turn out like Gabriel - overmedicated and institutionalized.
look, I'm sorry, ok?
I know that this is hard.
you don't have to apologize.
I should be used to seeing them.
you have to stop running away from them, else they're going to keep finding you.
you think I don't know that?
look, that's why you have to face them, ok?
you just have to find out what they need.
it will make them stop.
OK. I'll try.
let's start with his name.
did he give you that?
I think it's Daniel.
has he said anything about how he died?
um, I think he was in some kind of accident.
he said there were bodies around.
was there a fire? Cause he looked like had been burned.
honestly, I try not to look.
he talked about that, too.
OK. I see it a little bit, but for her to be your mini-me, her hair would have to be a lot different.
this is my friend Rick Payne.
he's a professor. He's also.
Oh, my gosh! Those eyes!
look at those eyes with that "don't even try lying to me, cause I can literally see right through you" look!
a little strange? - Yes.
the resemblance is uncanny.
OK. The ghost.
he's a boy, about Becca's age. His name is Daniel.
there was an accident in the woods.
there were lots of bodies around, so I'm thinking...
last year plane crash.
Yeah, he probably wandered off, got separated from the rest of the passengers.
Yeah. The woods are not far from the crash site.
well, that would explain the bodies.
and the burns on his face.
OK. Well, I'll check the manifest.
I'll see if his name turns up.
what about the voices?
what voices?
in your basement.
didn't you hear them?
no, not really.
wait a minute. You can hear voices that Melinda can't?
that would make her more powerful than you.
no. That's just how it works.
in the beginning, you get everything - you get voices, ghost energy, all of it.
and then, eventually, you learn to tune certain things out so you can function.
whatever she's hearing, it's probably coming from the tunnels.
do you still have that giant hole in the wall in your basement?
what tunnels?
Oh, you don't want to know about the tunnels.
well, why not? What's under there?
what's under there? More like who's under there.
more accurately, who isn't under there.
the amount of trapped souls
OK. You know what?
maybe she should focus on the ghost that's haunting her right now, don't you think?
Yeah, ok--yes. I do.
what's my job again?
check the plane manifest.
OK.
you and I have a field trip to go on.
come on, Let's go find Daniel.
Why?
because this is probably near where he died.
it will help him remember what happened.
but why look for him at all?
I mean, he hasn't bugged me in hours. Maybe he's finished.
no, he's not finished until he crosses over
until we help him cross over.
how many times did I tell you?
I don't like being left behind!
Becca, talk to him.
find out what he needs.
please, don't go.
ask him what's keeping him here.
why won't you just leave me alone?
they left me here.
they never said a word!
were they punishing me?
what was I supposed to think?
who? Daniel, who left you here?
who is she, anyway?
I don't like her.
Becca, find out what's keeping him here.
I don't care.
I hate him! I want him to go away!
I'm burning.
Hey, what do you see?
Daniel, talk to me, all right?
I want to help you. She wants to help you!
she doesn't want to help me!
why should I help her?
well, then, stop hurting her, all right?
let her go.
Hey.
what happened?
I was on fire!
it was horrible.
look, I know how painful this is, ok?
but look at me.
I'm right here. We're ok.
there's a reason that he told you all of that. Ok?
he was trying to tell you what happened to him, and with that, you can cross him over.
I don't care.
Yes, you do.
you want to help him and yourself.
I don't care about Daniel or any of them!
you can't give up.
Yes, I can!
I'm done.
I'm never going to do that again.
still not hungry?
you know, your parents are going to be here tomorrow, so we don't really have much time.
has a ghost ever done anything like this to you?
I've seen weird things before.
no one's ever tried to hurt me.
I know how awful this is.
but the vision, it's...
sometimes the only way they can tell you that they need your help.
but why should I help Daniel when all he tries to do is scare me?
look... I know that this is not fair.
most kids don't have to think about death until they're much older.
but you and me?
our lives are different.
you want a reason why you should help Daniel?
one is because if you don't, he'll never leave you alone.
but the real reason is because you can.
OK.
but how?
the vision.
tell me everything you saw.
there were bodies on the ground.
I'm right here.
I was on fire.
you mean Daniel was.
at first, his skin hurt really bad.
then, he couldn't feel anything.
there was metal burning.
and tires.
and there were cars.
they looked like tinfoil somebody punched really hard.
one of them was on fire.
I think that one was Daniel's.
can you see a license plate number?
there were letters. M-L-Y...
the number 8.
hey...
no, you did great.
you know what? Let's get out of here.
what do you think?
let's go walk amongst the living for a little while.
can I just be alone?
sure.
Hey, Melinda?
were you ever scared?
it's never been easy.
but I had someone who made me feel brave.
I hope I can do that same thing for you.
Hey.
how'd the open house for the new listing go?
Oh, people loved the cookies, but not bites on the house.
I brought leftovers.
thanks for covering.
Where's Becca?
she's at home resting.
Jim's there.
how's she doing?
we made some progress.
I think I know who the little boy in the woods is.
he's looking for his parents.
2 cars hit head-on, causing a pile-up.
there were 5 fatalities, including a family.
Becca had seen their license plate in a vision -
a mother, father, and a 13-year-old boy named Daniel Asher.
that's terrible.
Daniel died at the scene.
and his parents died later at the hospital.
you know, maybe they just saw the light and went right into it.
and he's just been waiting there ever since?
he thinks they're still alive?
I'm not sure.
but he needs to know that they've gone, and he should join them.
with any luck, Becca will be able to convince him of that.
it would really help them both.
you know what? I really have to go.
Hey.
you're back!
that's so great.
um, you could come meet my parents.
so, I was telling them all about how you helped me.
now, I admit that I was just pretending to see ghosts, just like you did when you were my age for attention.
Melinda. I'm Joan Cahill, Becca's mom.
I don't even know what to say.
honestly, I don't, either.
honey, the Cahills were able to get an earlier flight.
um, this is Tony.
Tony, this is my wife Melinda.
thank you for saving our daughter-- our whole family, actually.
well, I don't know if I really helped.
you did.
look, I don't know how you got through to her, but these things that she was imagining, we didn't know what to do.
frankly, I felt like we'd lost her long before she ran away.
but you're back now. Right, sweetheart?
things are going to be a-ok.
Yeah. A-ok, again.
thanks for not busting me.
so, what are you going to do now?
every time you see a ghost, just ignore it?
kind of already tried that.
Yeah, but it will be easier now. - How?
cause I know it's not my fault.
before, I thought I had something bad in me.
I was making them come to me and nobody else.
they come to you because you can see them.
and because they need your help.
look, this is who you really are.
it's who we both are.
no.
I'm not brave enough.
you comfortable, sweetie?
you can't hear a word I'm saying, can you?
I could sleep for about 100 years, you know?
should we try to get a later flight tomorrow?
no. Let's get home.
thank god, we can throw these away now.
what were we doing, making her take these?
Joan, wait...
she wasn't hallucinating.
she never actually saw anything.
I know. I hope it's over, but just in case...
it's not just about Becca.
it's about that little boy in the woods waiting on parents that will never come back.
Yeah, but Becca knows about the light now.
so maybe she's able to help him.
and he knows about you.
he can come to you.
and what about the ghost that haunts her after that?
and then, the one after that?
honey, no one could have helped her more than you did.
Yeah.
that's what kills me.
no. Get away from them.
I'd give anything just to be with my parents again.
Oh! No, no. Why can't you just leave me alone?
because then I'd be alone, too.
how'd you like it if I left you in the dark in those woods?
I begged you to.
but you didn't mean it.
why can't you just be my friend?
because you're dead!
you'd be dead, too, if I didn't help you find food and water.
I looked out for you.
every night, I was there, and you knew it.
OK. Fine. You watched over me. Thanks.
now, go, please.
I'm still protecting you.
what's that supposed to mean?
someone knows about you and your friend. That lady.
he found me, and he'll find you, too. - Who?
I'm not sure.
he wanted me to come with him, but I wouldn't.
he said he knows where they're keeping my parents.
I don't understand.
Melinda knows things. You should go to her.
no. She just wants to send me away so I'll never see my parents again.
please.
you have to help me, only you hear voices.
why don't you let me finish that up, huh?
go on up.
that's weird - Hey. - We are so sorry to bother you.
is Becca here?
please tell us she's here.
no, she's not.
Oh, god.
when was the last time you saw your daughter?
um, we were tired. We fell asleep.
probably 3 hours ago.
we already called the police.
I woke up freezing.
it always seemed so cold right before I hear her scream.
Becca gets night terrors.
and this time, she didn't call out. She was just gone.
Becca say anything? Was she talking to anyone?
I heard her whisper something.
she went into the bathroom.
she does that sometimes when she's trying to hide from us.
Yeah, but does she say anything?
I buried my head in the pillow. I couldn't listen.
OK. She was probably talking to Daniel.
and if she went with him, then she's trying to cross him.
I'm sorry. Cross him?
just take them to the police, all right?
I'm going to go to the woods. - You got it.
excuse me. What the hell is going on?
you know what? I'm really sorry to have to throw this at you, but your daughter's been trying to tell you for years.
you've tried pills. You've tried doctors.
the only thing you 2 never tried was believing her.
your daughter sees ghosts, ok?
and I know that because I see them, too.
look, you both have to understand that my wife has lived her entire life having people tell her she's crazy.
and maybe right now, you think she is, too.
but I'll tell you, she's the only chance you have of getting your daughter back.
you can hear it too, right?
this is where Melinda said the trapped souls are.
it sounds like they're hurting.
that's why we have to hurry.
Hello?
this is guardian-safe.
there's been an alarm activation at your place of business.
would you like us to dispatch the police?
the tunnels.
sorry, madam, I didn't hear you.
would you like us to dispatch the police?
no, no, no. It's my husband.
sometimes he forgets how the alarm works.
I'm so sorry. Thank you.
what? What?
what? - Hey.
in the square this afternoon, when you told Becca about the tunnels, didn't you tell her that she could get to them through the basement?
Oh, gee whiz. You know, I really thought there was going to be a "sorry I woke you up, professor" mixed in there.
she's in trouble, ok?
she ran away from her parents after they heard her talking to someone.
was it the ghost Daniel?
no, room service.
well, we know she heard us talking about the hole in the wall in your basement.
but why would they go into the tunnels?
because you told her that there were spirits trapped there.
maybe she and Daniel think it's the best way to get to his parents.
and by the way, the store alarm just went off.
Oh, boy. Sounds like Daniel's up to his old tricks again. - What?
remember, you asked me to read up on the accident?
well, the post mortem report says that that kid's blood alcohol level was a few notches above schnockered.
so, he was drunk?
very.
I think your parents are down there.
look, if you're scared, you don't have to do this.
you can just go.
I'll go alone.
you could get hurt.
I won't leave you.
we can do this.
Becca, you here?
mom, dad? Are you here?
she's here, another one.
mom? Dad?
are those your parents?
you. Is it over?
can I go now?
who are you?
he has a gun.
why did you all come here?
how did you find this place?
it still hurts.
we were promised.
you said...
he promised.
Becca, I'm scared.
who are all these people?
Melinda, see?
just a few stitches and you're all better.
and we can stop somewhere special on the way home.
Oh, Melinda.
it's ok, honey.
they're just upset.
we are supposed to help.
I can't understand them.
there's too many voices.
I know.
but if you try, you can hear what's important, the one soul that we need to hear most at that moment.
all we have to do is listening with our hearts.
where is he?
I can't find him!
sweet girl, can you help me?
I need to find my husband.
Daniel? I'm here.
I'm here. It's ok.
no, it's not.
we can't find my parents.
I know.
I did.
I listened for them.
then, I heard them calling for you.
Daniel? Honey - Daniel? Where is he?
I've been waiting for you for so long.
it's ok.
you can go to them.
Daniel, what's wrong?
Daniel. Come.
you said they'd never leave you.
but you didn't believe that, did you?
not after what happened that night before the accident.
it's my fault.
we never would have been in that car if I didn't screw up.
my friend Levi's parents were out of town.
we all said we were sleeping at someone else's house.
and we snuck into their liquor cabinet.
we went outside and started taking out some mailboxes.
someone called the police.
and then they called us.
at 2 A.M. We're picking our 13-year-old up from the police station.
blaming ourselves, each other.
arguing over who was supposed to follow up with Levi's parents, still thinking every mistake could be avoided.
if I hadn't done that, if you weren't so tired and worried.
Daniel! That car swerved into our lane.
dad!
it wasn't your fault.
and even if it was, we would never leave you.
then where were you?
your parents died at the hospital.
we didn't understand what happened.
how could we still be here and you not?
and then, we met a man who told us he could bring us to you.
a man. Who are you talking about?
he didn't say his name-- only that we shouldn't go into the light.
if we did, our son would be lost forever.
we're together now.
do you see it?
it's so beautiful.
come.
I can't.
I don't see it.
he needs your help.
but how? What's keeping him here?
just listen with your heart. Ok?
you'll find the answer.
he's staying behind because of me.
I've already hurt my family so bad.
I don't want to leave and hurt you.
Daniel, it's ok-- - it's not.
we know that now.
look around this place.
who's going to watch over you in the dark?
Daniel, if you do this...
you'll be helping Becca. You'll prove to her that there's nothing to be afraid of.
come on, Daniel. Just try.
see the light.
for me.
look at that.
mom.
dad.
I see it.
take care of her, will you?
Yes. Yes, I will.
we want to believe you.
you have no idea how much.
but it almost seems impossible.
if you need help explaining anything...
Dad...There's someone...a man.
he's been wanting me to tell you both something.
he's been asking for a long time.
I was scared of him at first because he looked...
he said he died of an aneurysm.
he said you're married because of him.
she's talking about Larry.
he introduced us, but Becca, he died before you were even born -
he wanted you guys to meet for so long.
but you guys just kept on saying no.
and he just kept saying.
have a little faith.
what if I don't know how they died, or what if I don't know what it is they're really missing?
what if it just--hey, relax. Ok?
I just saw you do it.
I didn't tell you what it was that Daniel needed.
you just listened with your heart.
Yeah.
can I ask you something?
when you were running away, why did you stop here, in Grandview?
I don't know, just a feeling.
the bus stopped, and something told me to get off.
it was just--something you had to do.
Yeah.
well, you know where to find me.
I wasn't sure if you were still in town.
something told me you were.
is it really worth it, Gabriel?
to break up families just for a few extra souls?
I mean, what could you possibly need them for?
it's not just about gaining or losing a few extra souls.
of course not, unless you happen to be one of them.
as usual, you're missing the big picture.
what is the big picture?
cause you're just a collector.
and please, don't stand there and pretend like you're doing something noble.
wait a minute.
you didn't want them, did you?
you wanted her.
that's what drew her here, the same thing that drew you.
please, don't do this.
you have a real choice.
you could work with me, and we can free all of those souls down there.
sorry. I picked another horse.
he's much faster than you.
then what are you doing here?
you're my sister.
and you have a choice too.
what does that mean?
it means don't be so sure you have all the answers.
there's a door in the archives that leads to the tunnels.
wait a minute, are you saying what i think you're saying?
let's have a baby.
Oh! oh, god, i love you.
what?
that's weird.
there's six of us, but there's only five shadows.
are you ok?
promise me something. - anything.
that no matter how long it takes, we never stop trying to get pregnant.
I promise.
OK. Even after we're pregnant, we have to keep trying.
check the fine print. I think it's in the wedding vows.
do you think that Delia noticed i didn't have any wine with dinner tonight?
no. I don't think she did.
but maybe you should tell her we're trying.
she is your best friend, huh?
it's just such a letdown, you know?
every time it doesn't happen, I
I don't want to let her down, too.
Hey, it's gonna happen.
we've only been trying 4 months.
I know.
Oh, no.
clancy, yeah.
right. Ok.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
there's a multiple victim fire at Rockland University,
one of the office buildings.
did they say which office building?
no.
honey, I'm gonna go check with the commander.
excuse me, have you seen Rick Payne?
professor Payne?
Hey, what do we got?
has anyone seen Rick Payne?
I have, but usually when I'm standing in front of a mirror.
you're ok. - yeah.
I'm more than ok. I mean, ask around. You'll hear that
so why the hell didn't you answer your phone?!
Melinda, I talked you on the telephone an hour ago!
I talked to you inside my home.
what would make you think that I was in that building?
get the paddles ready.
Oh. The shadow thing.
you thought it was a bad omen, huh?
you thought my number was up.
but I'm ok. I'm here.
I should have called you.
that's what a friend would have done.
a friend would have done more than that.
charging.
what just happened? Clear.
I see life.
Yes, we got him.
Yeah, he's responsive.
how long has this been going on?
ever since he regained consciousness.
who is he?
his name's Eli James.
he's a psychology professor with a therapy practice at the university.
his office was in the building that burned.
are his eyes ok?
Yeah, it's just swelling from the smoke.
he's fine.
how long has he lived in Grandview?
I don't know. Why?
and so it caught me, like, horrifically, - and then I - hi...
Eli, my name is Melinda Gordon.
sorry if I don't get up.
this is my friend Fiona.
nice to meet you.
should I know that name?
we've never met before,
which is... odd, in a way.
Why? Are you in the psych department?
no.
gambler's anonymous?
no. - Wait.
if you're that girl from the electric shock study,
those electrodes were not supposed to
OK, it's ok, Eli,
I understand. I...
I can talk to them, too.
talk to who?
ghosts.
if you work in the hospital,
this is definitely not post-trauma counselling protocol.
no one told you. - Told me what?
you know what, it's really better if I
told me what?
Eli, Fiona died
in that fire with you.
they couldn't bring her back, I'm so sorry.
Where's Fiona?
I just told you.
she's dead.
then who was i talking to?
you were talking to her ghost.
so do you think he's another one like you?
and that's what brought him to Grandview,
like your mom and Gabriel and all those others?
I don't think so.
there's something different about him.
I don't think he's here for the same reasons I am.
and I'm guessing that you're wishing
I wouldn't have brought Ned into this.
no, I-I wish I knew how to participate,
but it's like you're speaking some strange foreign languages.
I understand the words, but it all...
adds up to gibberish.
so what do you know about the ghost?
she was one of his patients.
they were caught in the fire together.
he was revived. I wish I knew more.
Yeah, like what they were doing together in his office at 10 pm.
well, that part I understood.
mind if I come in?
Melinda, hey.
how are you doing?
you're asking me that?
you're the one with the ghost problem.
no, I'm the one with post traumatic stress.
I lost a patient, and in case you forgot,
I kinda died.
it takes a lot less to make someone think you heard voices.
sounds very rational.
look, if this is a cry for help, I can help you
with your depression, your anxiety.
even your self-esteem issues.
but I gotta tell you,
I don't do well with your type of nut job.
my type of nut job?
Yeah. Bizarre beliefs, superstitious behavior.
people use that to hide from their real problems, ok?
I don't have the patience, you might say.
Wow. Is this the kind of bedside manner that they're teaching these days?
I'm sorry. I like to keep it real.
so i take it you haven't seen anymore ghosts?
safe assumption. - That's a lie!
Really? You can see through my eyes?
you're a mind reader now?
you're telling the truth.
I'm telling the truth, I'm lying,
make up your mind, lady.
you can't see them, but you can hear them.
say that again.
why don't you tell him?
whenever i talk to him, he shouts at the nurses to quiet down,
acting like i'm not here.
but I know he hears me.
I can see him reacting.
why won't he listen to me?
because he doesn't want to believe it.
because if it's true and he hears you,
then he might be a nut job.
I think we're done here, ok?
you can't just shut them out.
it's only going to get worse.
look, I can help you. just please
it's not just that he had never heard ghosts before this.
I was there. Ok, I saw Eli's spirit leave his body and then come back.
I've never seen anything like it.
Oh, and that's why i'm giving you these books.
these books cover all of that and more, ok?
paranormal phenomena, myths, theories about the beyond.
you're all right.
how come everyone is trying to get away from me?
Ah, finally, the real issue,
instead of this ghost story that you're hiding behind.
Yeah, I have enough shrinks in my life, thank you.
Melinda, I'm not a very sensitive guy, ok?
it once took a girlfriend 6 months to break up with me 'cause i thought she was expressing disbelief every time she said,"get out.
even i can tell you're upset.
I am not upset.
there is nothing about me that is upset, ok?
you're leaving for a sabbatical in a few days
for some new, important find in the Himalayas,
and I am very happy for you. What more do you want?
I'm glad we had this chat.
it was very refreshing, cleansing.
you'd like to know why this Eli character, all of a sudden,
he can hear ghosts, right?
right. And it obviously has something to do with him dying and then coming back.
it has everything to do with that.
N. d.e. Literature is chock full of stories like his.
N. d.e.You mean near death experience?
Yeah. Uh, here's how it usually works
you die, you come back to life,
and in some very rare cases,
there's a, uh, a thread
that connects you to where you were,
a tether, if you will.
so how come he can hear ghosts but he can't see them?
some n. d.e. s can see the ghosts,
some can hear them, some can even smell them,
and that's the worst because everything on the other side smells like stinky, rotten eggs.
Ugh. and that's permanent?
it varies, it varies.
sometimes your senses got strong as your brain processes the new input,
other times the thread snaps,
and you're just a poor, sightless mole like me.
your friend Eli, not universally liked here at school.
who doesn't like him?
a lot of people.
but most of members of the "I don't like that guy Eli" fan club are in his own department.
they think he's a bit of a cowboy.
breaks a lot of rules, - which normally I would applaud... - But?
but they say he does so at the expense of his patients.
you keep thinking every new day will be different,
but it never is.
day after day - buddy?
after day - buddy.
after day
Hey, buddy.
you said you wanted a shot of something. What will it be?
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
I already turned down the music.
what's your problem?
I think maybe you need to call somebody.
you think?
look! Whoever you people are,
I can't help any of you!
especially if I'm under a bus,
and that's my next stop!
everybody just shut up!
you're the one who called me?
Yeah, he said you might be able to help.
he scared all my business away, I had to call the police.
well, you can call the police back and tell them everything's going to be ok.
who are you, his doctor?
I know this is gonna sound strange,
but if you want your bar back
Hey, do whatever you have to.
great.
OK, everyone, let's quiet down.
quiet down.
I said quiet!
look, you all want help,
an I really understand that.
but it's gonna have to happen one at a time,
and later or not at all.
or not at all!
now leave us alone.
go.
sometimes it helps to pretend it's real.
how did you get them to listen to you?
I just told them that I would do the same for them later.
Yeah, great, but how do you keep them from coming back?
you don't.
who are you?
hmm, it's a long story.
let's have a seat.
so the good news is, I'm not dead.
the bad news is, I'm going to have to spend the rest of my life listening to people who are?
and helping them.
it's how they can get peace,
and you can get a little for yourself.
you said it might change over time,
like the ghost voices might go away?
anything is possible, yes.
any chance I can speed up that process?
I mean, with like a baseball bat to my head?
some medicines?
my mother tried everything but the baseball bat,
and trust me, it's not a good way to go.
I think you're looking at this the wrong way.
hey...
what you have is a gift.
Yeah, from someone who really hates me.
Fiona, you're back.
tell Eli how he can help you.
I want him to know i don't blame him.
blame him? What is she talking about?
excuse me...
are you Eli James?
and friends.
who are you?
detective Neely.
you're wanted for questioning in connection to the death of Fiona Raine.
what makes him so sure it was arson?
they're not sure about anything,
but they found accelerant traces near the point of origin.
and that would be near Eli's office?
right outside.
so he's a suspect?
no, officially he's a "person of interest.
they don't have enough evidence to hold him here.
but unofficially?
unofficially, they're trying to figure out if he had a reason to burn down his own office.
I think it had something to do with the argument people heard.
between he and Fiona.
you know, Payne said that he has a really bad reputation at school.
and there's the ghost.
and what about her?
right before the police came in, she said that she didn't blame him.
blame him for what? - Who knows?
but she's a ghost.
I'll see you at home?
Mm-hmm. Ok.
so is it true?
did you start the fire?
No!
but thanks for asking.
you know, we need to talk about Fiona.
I can shrink my own head, thanks.
look, I told you if she's not in the light,
that she's obviously here for a reason.
so she needs something from you.
not to mention what you need from her.
Oh, what's that?
well, if you didn't start that fire,
she may be the only one who can prove it.
OK, look. Let's just pretend for a minute that this whole thing isn't nuts.
and neither are you.
or me. What am I supposed to do?
start telling the truth.
and all of it.
at first, when we met in my office,
she would just sit there with her arms folded and glare at me.
so I shook it up.
I knew she liked horses,
so I took her to the track.
and she started to talk.
what were you treating her for?
general attachment issues.
I was helping her dump an on again-off again boyfriend named Ken
who'd been messing with her head since high school.
did the boyfriend know that you were talking to her?
I don't think so.
she moved a few towns away to put distance between them.
she rents a place here with roommates that she met through school.
a dead-end, long-distance relationship.
that's how co-dependent they were.
she even asked my advice on treatment for him.
do you think he could be the one who started the fire?
this guy's got a lot of problems,
but arson's not one of them.
what kind of problems?
this guy never met a cult or superstition he didn't like.
he once kept Fiona on the phone all night
because an aura reader convinced him
she was seeing another man.
was she?
Eli, did you get involved with your patient?
no.
but she was coming down with a classic case of transference.
so she was falling in love with you?
night of the fire,
I just told fiona I couldn't treat her anymore.
she freaked.
that's why we were at my office so late.
she called and said she had to see me.
people heard you arguing.
what happened?
I told I would refer her to one of my colleagues.
she said she only wanted to see me.
I kept telling her that couldn't happen.
she just kept yelling.
then what?
smoke started coming under the door,
and I remember it was so thick,
it felt like my lungs were on fire.
next thing I knew,
I guess I was dead.
this is our other roommate.
she was just asking about Fiona
Hi, nice to meet you.
and Eli.
I take it you guys are not big fans of Eli.
we don't want to get anyone in trouble.
that's ok. I'm not the police or the press, so...
what don't you like about him?
well, he was her shrink, right?
Yes.
he sure didn't act like one.
can you be more specific?
shrinks are supposed to have, like,
office hours, right?
it's usually how it works.
well, this guy, he'd come by at all different times,
day and night,
taking her to restaurants, bars.
it was so obvious something was going on.
something romantic?
he sure wished it was.
what about Fiona?
she liked the attention.
the drinks were free.
and that's as far as it went with her?
definitely - For sure.
she has lots of pictures of the three of you,
but no family photos.
do you know where she might keep them?
I don't know.
but I only moved in in the spring.
you guys have been roommates for longer.
did she ever talk about that stuff with you?
Eli, no...
please...
please.
make it stop.
make what stop?
her.
make her leave us alone, or I'll make her,
like I made you.
ghosts have the ability to manipulate energy,
especially angry ghosts.
this one seems to have done it a lot like
sunshine through a magnifying glass.
so you think this is a pattern
because Fiona had a history of arson?
she burned down the house that she was living in when she was 12.
how come the police didn't know this?
how come we didn't know about this?
because she was so young,
there was never any charges.
there was never any criminal record.
but she was a ward of the state,
and it went into family service's files.
as her therapist,
I had access to those files.
so that's why she didn't have any family pictures,
because she didn't have a family.
they died when she was a 3.
the house that she burned down was her foster father's.
I take it she wasn't too fond of the guy.
or his physical and mental abuse.
where does he live now, an ashtray?
he was out of the house when she burned it down.
but she made her point.
she got placed with another family.
why didn't you say anything before?
because I-I thought she started that fire because of me.
I think she died because of me.
how could she have started it?
she was with you in the same room.
I don't know.
a homemade device with a fuse hanging out,
she dropped it off at the front right before she came in.
so you think that she wanted to kill you.
or at least threaten me,
like she did her foster father.
but she had no idea the fire was going to spread.
OK, so you feel responsible, why come clean now?
last night, I...
I heard her voice again.
she was making threats.
I warned you about this.
against you.
she said,"tell her to leave us alone,
or i'll do the same thing to her that i did to you.
OK. So we need to get her to cross over.
she's obviously sticking around for some reason, and it's not to apologize to Eli.
here's something very mysterious.
how come all your notes smell like beer?
because they were on fire.
the bottle was closer than the extinguisher.
I'm smelling a pilsner,
maybe something czech.
not bad. - i went to college.
OK. We know that she's haunting someone.
we can't find the boyfriend.
what about the foster dad?
Yeah, he's the first person she tried to cook.
he died 6 years ago, heart attack, I think.
good riddance, if you ask me.
how did Fiona get along with her foster families afterwards,
were there any more problems?
no, she was a good girl.
she was one of my favorites.
wish I could have done more for her.
do you know why we're asking these questions?
it's about the fire at Rockland University.
some people think Fiona started it.
is there a reason maybe they shouldn't?
you know what,
forget we asked. I'm sorry.
you shouldn't have to violate patient confidentiality.
screw confidentiality.
those rules are there to protect those kids,
and they're not protecting Fiona.
look, I'm not saying arson's a good way to solve anything,
but there were three other fosters in that home.
I sure wish we'd known what was going on.
if Fiona started that fire,
she didn't just save herself, she saved all of their lives.
and if she didn't...
you keep saying "if.
do the math.
one kid was younger, 2 kids were older.
old enough to be tried as adults?
can you give us their names?
I can't.
but i can tell you this
after the fire, when I asked Fiona what happened,
she zipped those lips tight.
but the second the cops started questioning her older siblings,
she came right out and practically shouted,"I did it!
so you're saying you've seen her ghost,
but now you can't find her, so you came here?
sometimes spirits attach themselves to places they know.
I thought maybe I could find her in her bedroom.
that still doesn't tell me why he's here.
I, um...
I can talk to them, too.
ghosts.
I know, it sounds nuts.
I still think so myself.
do you really expect us to believe that
I believe him. - What?
ever since Fiona died,
we've both had this feeling...
I don't know how to describe it,
bubut somehow we felt her.
haven't we, Marley?
and that's because she's still here.
but she doesn't belong here. She really needs to cross over.
well, go talk to her then.
Christian! - Why not?
what is the harm?
Oh, one favor.
she has this cd.
could you ask her if it'd be ok if I was to keep it,
before we release the rest of her stuff?
we'd be happy to.
if you're nearby and you can hear me,
we really need to talk to you.
what do you want from me?
the same as I always did.
I want to help you.
since when did you ever help anyone?
look, we need to know the truth.
did you start the fires or didn't you?
it was outside his office.
I knew he'd be in there. Who else would have started it?
I wasn't talking about that fire.
I was talking about the one at your foster dad's house.
I started both.
why work so hard to make me think you're an arsonist?
why work so hard to make me think you really cared about me?
come on, this is serious.
this isn't a game.
that's funny, coming from you.
I just remember something.
what you said to Eli, you said,"leave us alone." Isn't that right?
back in my apartment, yes.
OK, so then who's the "us," Fiona?
because at first, I thought it had to do with you and Eli, but now
I started those fires.
don't make me start more.
look, if you're hiding something or someone, we're not the police.
OK? We don't want to
whoa, what just happened?
she's gone.
what if she's telling the truth?
she's covering for someone. Maybe it's that boyfriend,
but I just think it has something to do with that first fire, you know,
like a foster kid.
we have to find out who else lived in that house.
guess I won't take anything out today.
structure empty at time of fire.
occupants later accounted for.
owner Tom Moody
minors female, 12 years,
female, 16 years, male, 18 years.
it wasn't supposed to happen like this.
you were just trying to be a good sister.
which one are you covering for, him or her?
I warned you. Stay away.
I'll move on when you will.
maybe some things are better off left alone,
you ever think about that?
Fiona, no.
I'm sorry.
I really am,
but you brought this on yourself,
and now you have to pay the price.
that was a longshot, anyway.
without a court order,
the county keeps family service records sealed.
why hasn't Melinda called by now?
she must have found something.
maybe she has called.
have you checked your esp-mail?
I don't know what's crazier,
the fact that she believes in all this stuff,
or the fact that I believe her.
I heard that. It doesn't change the fact that she's the most amazing person I've met since...
she's the most amazing person i've ever met.
I hear that, too.
Yeah. what's so significant about these notes, Eli?
Fiona always described him in so much detail,
but she never used his last name.
he, who's he?
her boyfriend. and something else,
how was he packing up her stuff when there were no boxes?
he who? You said you never met him.
Christian, the roommate.
he said he was piling up her stuff so he could release it.
release it? That's the word he used, release?
Yeah. I found that odd at the time.
the whole thing was. releasing her stuff,
but wanting to keep some random folk music cd?
what kind of folk music?
African, I think. - Ok.
but what did he put her things in if it wasn't boxes?
he had some kind of metal tub.
didn't you say her boyfriend was into the occult,
and weird beliefs?
Yeah, why? Well, it was an african custom,
part of the yoruba tradition,
where possessions of someone who's passed prematurely are set fire to.
that way it'll release their spirit.
you know, why else would he use a metal tub unless he was going to tie-dye everything?
she said her boyfriend lived out of town.
well, what if she made that part up?
what if she had no boyfriend?
what if she had all the problems she told you about,
but with someone she wasn't romantically involved with?
someone she wanted to get away from,
but she didn't know how to.
who she felt she needed to protect at the same time.
I think we already know this quote, unquote boyfriend.
and the foster brother.
and they're both.
what are you doing here?
here,
breathe through this, ok?
because you could get killed.
that's the whole idea.
they'll find me, then they'll know the truth.
Christian, look, I get it. Ok, you wanted to protect her
and that's why you followed me here.
we took care of each other.
OK, well, let's tell her that,
all right? Let's get out of here, come on.
she wouldn't want you to get hurt.
then why'd she have to start seeing him?
Because! she needed help for the both of you.
OK, she just wanted advice from Eli.
come on!
she was trying to get rid of me.
I was more like a family than anyone she ever had!
no, she wanted to help you just like you helped her.
I didn't help her, I killed her!
but you didn't mean to.
you didn't want her to talk to Eli, isn't that right?
I saw her crying after she talked to him.
I saw what he did to her.
so I went to his office and started the fire.
I was just trying to scare him away.
like i did in the first fire when we were kids.
Eli needs to hear this, ok?
we just-let's just get out of here!
she'll never forgive me!
I'm sure that she's already forgiven you!
what are you talking about?
why do you think
she wanted us to believe she was the arsonist?
it's because she loves you.
OK, because she wanted to protect you.
she's right, Christian, listen to her!
she's here! She's here, ok?
she wants you to live, so please, please just take this.
Just-please!
Oh, god, he's dying!
it's too late!
no, it is not too late! All right, go and get Eli!
quick! Christian, come on!
she still hasn't answered. She's not picking up.
I'm right here in front of you. I need your help, please.
what was that? - The ghost.
the ghost, where? I thought you couldn't see them.
it's right by me.
Fiona, is that you?
they need you to come right now.
slow down, i can't see your lips move.
you have to speak slowly.
they're in trouble, Christian and that woman.
Melinda? Where is she?
the archives! Hurry!
the tunnel door.
Eli? Eli, what's going on?
I can't understand you.
what's going on at the archives?
Oh, my god, Melinda!
Hey, we got a fire at the archives. Gotta go.
you're the one from the hospital.
and the fire, you
you were there, too.
we're in many places, it's true.
Why?
what are you here for?
to watch.
but just now...
you did more than watch. You-you saved me,
didn't you?
we were only returning a favor.
how did I ever help you?
that's not important now.
what's important is you have to understand.
understand what?
we watch many like you who do what you do
but don't understand.
if you're trying to tell me I should stop,
you can save yourself.
understand the price.
you don't know the price.
what price?
you move between the world of life and death.
like your friend Eli,
sometimes you come back from one with a touch of the other.
a touch?
of death.
be careful.
it might brush off.
on what?
on what you touch.
it's ok. I barely breathed any smoke.
it's just a precaution.
look, I used my clothing like you taught me a thousand times.
stayed low to the ground?
I'm here, aren't I?
don't I get any credit for that?
full credit, ok?
all the credit in the world. do you want anything?
I'll get you some water. - Yes.
I'll be right back.
Hey, thanks for letting them have a minute together.
I still don't get a guy tries to kill her and all she wants to do is get him help.
Fiona understands, Christian.
she loves and forgives you.
it's time for you to both say good-bye.
what can I tell you?
that's my wife.
we kept in touch after they put us in different foster homes.
then after I got a job and my own place,
I heard he'd been getting into fights and stuff.
I asked him to move in,
but I made him pretend he was just
some roommate I met on the internet.
I was afraid people would figure out
where we came from.
the fire and everything.
what made you decide to get help?
I needed to talk to someone who wouldn't tell anyone.
christian liked to pretend he was my brother taking care of his little sister.
but he has so many issues.
after a while, it was just too much for me.
and I have my own issues, too.
now I feel like I've made everything worse.
how do I know they're not going to send him to jail for killing me?
the lawyers say, based on his mental state,
he'll stay out of prison.
so he's going to rot in some awful asylum?
Fiona, you have my word, I'll take care of him.
I think with the right medication
your word? That's what christian's depending on?
look, Eli's done everything he can for both of you.
no. Fiona's right.
my word hasn't meant much, not to her.
what does that mean?
remember that night when I called
and I told you that we couldn't work together anymore?
but I know, I know you have feelings for me, I know it!
no, no, you are confused.
no, I'm not!
I can feel it.
you are a very nice person.
I've enjoyed our sessions.
but there is nothing more there.
I lied.
there was more.
much more.
I don't understand.
Fiona, you've seen my apartment.
I have pictures of you everywhere.
next to all of your other patients, so what?
all that i thought about,
day after day, night after night,
was how I could make you feel better.
if you were unhappy, so was I.
you don't feel that way about all of your other patients?
Fiona, if I cared about them all that much, I'd lose my mind.
if i cared about you any more...
I'd lose my job.
OK.
what am i supposed to do with all of that right now?
take it with you.
wherever you're going.
what's that light?
that's where you're going.
it's amazing.
you're a really good doctor, you know that?
I'm not so sure.
be sure.
my heart was broken,
and now it's fixed.
she's gone.
man.
is it always like that?
no.
sometimes it's better.
everybody got what they wanted?
perfect. Oh, yeah.
honey, they're being polite.
Melinda asked for chopsticks,
and Jim asked for low sodium soy sauce.
right. Sorry. Sorry. Be right back.
bad enough you guys make him work at the store too, right?
he needs 2 jobs if he's going to pay for that video game that he's so addicted to.
which, by the way, he has no time to play.
what?
do you think I'm hard on him?
no. Not at all. Not us.
you know, parenting is a lot harder than it looks.
and when you two decide to have kids,
you will know what i'm talkin' about.
well...
here's to us finding out someday.
soon.
here, here. Mmm.
excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Hey.
what's with that email you sent me?
come see me before you leave, if not, be careful.
what, did you have another bad omen?
what's the difference?
I mean, no matter what, you should be careful.
you're going to a third world country.
there's politics, scary food.
you care about me.
that's why you've been so mad.
I figured it out. You don't want me to go.
of course I care.
a lot?
you care about me a lot.
what do you want me to say?
that you're one of my best friends,
and that although I full understand why you have to go,
it hurts... to know that you would pick an old pile of artifacts over me?
Yeah, something like that would be nice.
happy?
can I have a hug for the road,
maybe a big squeezy, chesty one?
don't be an idiot.
I know I pushed it, I knew it.
don't be an idiot, be safe.
Hey, I'm coming back here,
and I'm coming back safe and sound, ok?
I promise you that.
Lucas! Come on. It's me. Open up.
look. I am sorry I am late,
but I couldn't get away.
are you there?
are you looking for Lucas?
uh, No. I'll just come back.
well, he should be here.
his car's parked in his space and mine.
could you tell him that those parallel white lines actually serve a purpose?
I had to park on the street again.
Lucas!
Lucas!
somebody help!
I don't know. I just saw him lying by his car.
so tell me again what happened, ma'am.
Hello?
Yes. This is Melinda Gordon.
sure I remember you.
Lucas? I'm so sorry.
um, yeah, ok.
Thanks.
OK. Weird.
what was that?
well, this guy from my high school,
Lucas Marston, he died.
I never heard you talk about him.
was he a good friend? - No.
not at all.
so why did I just get invited to his funeral?
there's Haylie.
Haylie, hi.
guest of honor here yet?
I don't see him, but I've seen a couple people checking me out just in case I did.
honey, I think they were just checking you out.
I've literally heard, like, 5 guys say how beautiful you were.
Yeah. Meaning how much I've changed,
but one thing has not.
Hey. I think they probably included you because they remembered you and maybe they liked you.
I was the kid who was caught talking to dead people, ok?
they called me a freak, a mental case,
and my personal favorite -- Melony Gordon.
catchy, I know, but not at the time.
all right. So it was a drag,
but then why are we here?
well, because Lucas always seemed like a nice guy.
and Grace, too, but then again,
maybe they were so into each other,
they were too busy to be mean.
which one's Grace?
uh, pretty blond. The one that got icy reception from Haylie.
they used to be friends.
Haylie, you know, she was Lucas' on-and-off-again girlfriend.
I thought you said you didn't know these people.
Oh, I knew of them. Everyone did.
you know, they were a power clique,
super beautiful and all best friends.
go. Let's go.
I'll be right back.
Oh. Looks like Grace is with Ryan now.
him I know.
Really? How do you know him?
he's a surgical resident at Grandview Hospital.
that is so disappointing.
when the person who's voted most likely to succeed actually does...
um... guess I was right about why I was asked here.
Melinda.
grace, hi.
uh, you met my husband Jim, right?
Yes, hi. And actually, I have a favor to ask hi.
that I hope you won't mind,
but, um, if you're going back to Grandview,
would you mind riding with me?
the reason I called you was,
you remember in high school how you said you could see ghosts?
I never said that.
not if I could help it, and I still don't.
but do you believe that you can, um, see them, the dead?
have you seen Lucas?
no.
so what is it like when someone is haunting you?
I mean, are they around all the time, or do they just kind of come and go?
I mean, what can they do to someone?
you mean, to you.
look. I -- I found him,
and there was blood, not just on Lucas from where he'd collapsed
but streaked across his car window.
I know it sounds crazy.
I'm so nervous.
grace?
Ahh. Oh -- Oh, god. Oh, god.
that is disgusting.
are you all right?
Melinda, the medical examiner said that when they found Lucas he had been dead for hours,
but I saw that blood appear,
and ever since I saw it,
I've felt something around me.
I can't describe it.
I'm not sure you have to.
because -- because you know the feeling?
Yeah. Pretty well.
wait. So the ghost smeared its own blood for Grace to see?
well, yeah, Eli.
I mean, you've seen them move objects around.
it's pretty much the same principle.
the on the way home hurled itself against the windshield?
ghosts can sometimes act out.
Hey. If I'm gonna hear ghosts,
I might as well get the whole picture.
you know what? That surprises me because most people in your position, they just
you mean, who died and come back with bonus features?
you know that many of us?
Melinda, I've written books upon books on subjects about a thousandth as cool as what's going on in my skull right now.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
this whole ghost thing,
it's kind of creepy at times,
but this, this psycho paranormal whatever is a trip.
glad to hear it.
how can I help?
well, anytime that a ghost comes to you,
no. I mean, you.
loop me in.
how else am I gonna learn?
can I use your computer?
who knew Hamilton High was a feeder school for the Ivies?
after Yale, Mr. Lucas Marston worked in the skiing industry.
he was a lift attendant.
he dabbled in real estate development.
his dad owns an apartment building.
I overheard someone at the wake saying that he was the handyman.
so if you know so much about the ghost,
why are we bothering with the obituary spin?
well, because Lucas' background is just a starting place.
I mean, the truth is, I didn't get a good look at the ghost.
that alone can tell you something.
chockfull of antioxidants.
no, thanks.
so you think the ghost,
miss popular mowed down the night of her friend's wake was somebody random?
no. There's always a connection,
but if the ghost that I saw on the road was Lucas, why wasn't he at his own funeral?
soaking up the kind words.
Yeah. Something like that.
maybe the words people said under their breaths weren't so kind.
call me crazy, but when a perfectly healthy, bright, but underachieving 29-year-old suddenly keels over,
I smell...
drugs.
I haven't seen the result of the tox report,
but they're saying it was an overdose.
grace, don't do this.
we don't have anything to feel guilty about.
we know what we did.
I have to scrub up, but we'll talk.
no, we won't, not about this.
more light, please.
would somebody get that out of my eyes, please?
are you ok, Dr. Hellar?
Yeah.
then why don't you close up?
right.
all right. Stitch and dress.
OK.
we're good here.
nice work, everybody.
whoa, whoa. What the hell?
the wound's closed. Where's this blood coming from?
Whoa! Oh, my god!
no. What's going on?
I'll get Dr. Dugan.
Ryan comes tearing out of there.
the nurse I spoke to said there was blood everywhere.
what happened? - I don't know,
but when the surgeon comes back,
no more blood, patient is fine.
the blood has to mean something.
Thanks. And why don't you not go to work right now?
as much as I love playing hooky with you,
I have to go.
Oh. You forgot one of your tear sheets.
wait a minute. We're putting a 6-burner stove in the nursery?
it's for the garage.
I was thinking that we could convert it into a guest house, you know,
for a live-in sitter or for our mothers.
I mean, it's a good idea,
but, uh, I mean, converting the garage now.
aren't we getting a little ahead of ourselves?
because I'm not getting pregnant?
Hey. No, No. Because when you do,
we'll still have 9 months.
I mean, let me run the numbers a little bit,
think about it, ok?
OK. Sure.
Lucas' death, well, it freaked us both out,
I have to be honest,
but what happened at the hospital,
I think it was a ghost.
did you feel anything strange,
a chill you couldn't explain,
after Lucas died?
ghosts. We're talking ghosts now with...
Ryan, I asked Melinda for her help.
look. A suture must have ruptured.
I made a mistake, ok? It happens.
I've been stressed.
I work crazy hours,
and my best friend from high school just died.
so you and Lucas were still close?
we were fine.
I am happy to finish my coffee.
and go back to my life.
because I am not afraid of the dead,
but you came to me, and an innocent person lost a lot of blood.
because you have something you need to resolve,
with either Lucas or someone else.
who else would it be then?
I haven't seen the ghost, so I don't know who it is,
but when a ghost doesn't reveal themselves,
it's for a reason.
either they're hiding something,
or they have a project in mind,
like torturing you.
why don't you try to not say that like you enjoy it?
I don't,
and I don't like seeing souls linger,
but that's what they do when they're trying to finish something.
well, you're casting an awfully wide net there.
I don't know what Lucas did for the last 10 years when he was supposed to be building a career, a life.
you want to know? Ask Haylie.
she waited around long enough for him to get his act together.
so if you want to know what he didn't finish,
why don't you try everything?
and he's got no one to blame but himself.
Oh, my god!
you're bleeding.
Ryan.
I need another napkin.
what was that?
you found him. You were there when the police came.
are they sure his body wasn't moved?
what are you talking about?
grace, let's go. Come on.
I've had enough.
we don't need your particular brand of help, ok?
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Ah. Hamilton high, 1998.
big hair and big dreams.
Oh, wait. That's not you!
no, it's not, but will show you Lucas.
the guy who died? He's so cute.
Yeah. Died or was murdered by his friend.
I saw it in a vision,
but I only got a piece of the story.
which is not exactly the story Ryan's telling?
no. He seems pretty keen on blaming Lucas for his own death.
he said he was a real screw-Up,
and that if I doubted him,
I could talk to Haylie.
well, color me doubtful.
hmm. My favorite color.
are you calling Haylie?
are you kidding? The girl was so perfect in high school,
there's not crack in her demeanor.
she would never open up to me.
come on. You are not still afraid of the popular girl?
hardly.
besides, Eli is a very experienced grief counselor,
and he wants to learn, so let him melt the ice queen.
I spent a third of my life as Lucas' girlfriend,
give or take our many breakups,
and even in death, who does he go to? Grace.
look, Haylie. It isn't just Grace.
Lucas is haunting Ryan, too.
were they rivals?
Lucas and Grace, I mean, they were closer to each other than to anybody
they were actually sleeping with.
come on. - Ryan know this?
well, I'm sure. They never hid it.
they'd be on the phone for two hours at a stretch.
there was something unhealthy about it.
that wasn't exactly helping his battle with drugs.
he took antianxiety medication,
but I never saw him take anything else.
I've treated a lot of addicts.
they're very secretive.
he wasn't always.
it wasn't always so hard for him to be happy.
you make it seem like something happened.
what was it?
I wish I knew.
I think that Ryan and Grace do,
because senior year, the 3 of them,
they went to look at some colleges.
they were gone for 4 days,
and when they came back, Lucas was never the same.
haylie gave you her keys to Lucas' apartment?
you're a quick study.
what can I say? People trust me.
I'm a professional.
it sounds like to me that Lucas was still in love with Grace and Ryan knew it.
I'm not sure this was about Grace.
it seems like Lucas was more haunted than haunting.
so the question is, who or what was haunting him,
and is it the same spirit that's haunting Ryan and Grace?
shouldn't we be, like, wearing latex gloves, carrying flashlights?
knock yourself out.
no need. These will do the trick.
benzodiazepine,
a little dose will help you get some sleep.
a larger dose will help you with anxiety.
supersizing can kill you.
what is it?
looks like family, maybe a sister or niece.
Lucas was an only child.
Oh, my god, Lucas. Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god!
grace, Grace, shut up!
Oh, my god! - What are we gonna do?
what? What is it?
the 3 of them...
they killed a man.
that's it then.
the ghost was telling you he was murdered, not Lucas.
he didn't tell me anything.
I got a vision from his picture,
but I still don't know who he is,
and if he wants me to know the truth,
then why isn't he coming to me?
maybe he wants you to come to him.
for someone who's gift is in their ears,
you're not a very good listener.
Eli?
this wasn't just for pictures.
the victim kept I. D. In here, too,
which I'm sure Lucas trashed in case anyone found it.
there was something in this sleeve for a very long time.
haylie said something about a road trip fall of your senior year.
she mentioned something happened and Oktoberfest in Cambridge.
well, that gives us a definite weekend.
that, a partial name and address,
and it sure looked like he had a child with someone.
his widow. That's my next step.
what if I took that step for you?
I think I'm up to it if you think it could help.
Yes. That would help a lot.
Hey. No, no, No. No. It's not even 3: 00.
no. Oh, look. I got to go cover for sully.
I really got to go, and I'm gonna be late, so don't wait up.
Hey. What's wrong?
well, I just kind of thought we could
I mean, if we're gonna get pregnant, you know,
we have to...have sex!
we got that covered, right?
today. It's just I've been tracking my cycle,
and there's this window,
and it's basically closing tonight.
right, and that's -- that's why you've been playing hooky from work.
well, it's not the only reason,
but we did agree that we would try, so...
you're right. We did, we did,
but, I mean, honey, do we have to schedule our sex life, you know,
or convert a garage to have kids?
it's just so much pressure.
you're right. You're right.
Hey. I want you, I always want you,
but it's just we got so many stresses in our life.
let's not make this another one, all right?
Yeah. Can I help you?
Hi. My name is Eli James. I'm sorry I didn't call before I came over.
yeah?
I'm sorry. I just-- I'm here because...
that's right. You've seen her.
that girl grew up without a father.
because?
tell her you have something of theirs.
I'm sorry. -Tell her.
tell her now.
I'm just -- Ok.
no, No. I have something of yours.
I mean, I have something of your husband's.
uh, honey, can you go check on the dinner?
I'll be out back.
I don't understand.
you said these photos of my husband were in your friend's apartment?
how -- How could that be?
I was hoping you could tell me.
well, I don't know any Lucas,
and Tim's wallet was with his body.
this was all that was missing.
didn't you find that strange?
mister, I had a toddler and dead husband.
worrying about a few photos wasn't at the top of my list.
I'm sorry.
I am, too.
sorry he died out on that road alone, pitch black,
rain pouring down.
the coroner said that he'd severed an artery,
so it was probably fast,
but define fast you know, if you're Tim.
what did they tell you about the accident?
just that. It was an accident.
there were no other skid marks,
the road was slick.
he just wiped out.
who found 'em?
a little old lady driving her old husband to work,
whatever work couldn't get to be done.
are you ok, mom?
Hi, honey. It's ok.
OK.
so how did your friend get these from my husband?
unless he was there when he died.
you said you didn't know Lucas.
do you know these people?
they'd be older now.
no.
hold on. Him. Him I know.
him? That's Lucas.
no. He said his name was Mark.
you met him? When?
he came by the house a few months after my husband's death
said he worked with Tim once
and that he owed him some money.
seemed like he didn't have much,
but he sent what he could over the years.
wait. Over the years?
every once in a while I'd get a cashier's check
for 50 bucks, a few hundred.
well, I cashed them.
I thought he was a buddy, you know, took pity on us,
and frankly, we needed the money, so...
I never realized that it was, um, sort of...
blood money.
you should have heard it.
this guy sounded so bitter, like a big hunk of bitterness in the front row seating in my frontal lobe.
Yeah, but it sounds like Lucas was haunted for years,
but why not Grace and Ryan?
I mean, they were there, too.
who says they weren't haunted this whole time?
maybe they just dealt with it better.
no. It was new for Grace.
she was scared. She kept asking what a ghost could do.
because she thinks it killed her friend,
and she just realized...
they're next.
can't you just drive me back to the city tonight?
Lucas' sendoff is tomorrow
the people that couldn't make the funeral are flying in.
"his sendoff." I hate that phrase.
you said "memorial" sounded geriatric.
is there anything I can say right now that won't piss you off?
you could tell the truth.
Yeah. We all could have.
but we didn't.
we made a choice to get on with our lives.
don't you feel it?
he is with us!
he was with Lucas all the time.
grace, the man died 10 years ago, ok?
it's ridiculous. Crazy people believe in ghosts.
Ryan.
No!
they brought them in about an hour ago,
and Ryan was pretty banged up,
and they're giving him a full body scan,
but he was lucky.
grace had some contusions, but his side took
the brunt of the roll.
how did she seem?
I didn't talk to her, but they said she was really shaken up.
grace.
please. Make him stop.
so I was just kicking and screaming,
and this policeman took his hand,
and he just dragged it along the windshield
just to show me that it was just mud. It was mud.
do you know what I thought it was?
blood?
Yes.
I've seen it, too.
I know about the guy who died 10 years ago.
so it was him all along?
how did he die?
we took a road trip. I don't know.
I mean, we were just going to see some colleges...
so we're at this party, right?
and Ryan knew this guy up in Binghamton,
and he invited us to a frat party,
and we should have just stayed there,
but we promised our parents that we would head home.
and Lucas was supposed to be the designated driver,
but he ended up just being the least drunk,
and that was not like him.
he was always so responsible.
he was a really good guy.
and he was driving superslow when this guy on a motorcycle just came up behind us.
this guy's practically on our fender
what's he doing?
he wants you to speed up.
but the road, it just--It curved,
and it was so foggy, and I guess that the guy just got stuck and it pissed him off,
and that's when he decided to try to take us on.
you ok, Lucas? Yeah, sure.
slow down, slow down. Slow way down.
just teach him a lesson.
well, come on! What, you want to join our party?
Ryan! Ryan!
whoa, whoa, whoa! Did you see that?
Oh, my god!
you got to stay in the car.
please.
he must have been thrown.
here we go.
come on!
come on!
Ryan.
come on.
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
his leg is half off.
Oh, my god! Grace, Grace, shut up.
what are we going to do?
there's nothing we can do.
a phone. A phone. We'll call 911.
he's dead, and you're drunk,
and we're all drunk.
I'm not drunk.
tell that to a breathalyzer.
Ryan, what are you saying?
I'm saying this never happened.
we didn't hit him. There's no evidence.
it's his own fault!
OK, ok. So we'll tell the cops that.
listen. You want your life ending on this road tonight, too?
what we did, it haunted Lucas.
and you.
you said you felt it, an angry presence.
Yes. Ever since Lucas died.
but not before? No.
not that I don't think about it all the time.
the blood.
there was so much blood.
I cannot stand the sight of it.
your fear of blood,
did you ever talk to Lucas about it?
Yeah. He was the only one I could talk to.
Lucas?
you can skip the blood and tell me what you want.
I know it's you.
I never said I was anyone else.
no. I guess you didn't have to.
you just let their guilt do the work.
Ryan's guilt has a ways to go.
he'd do anything to cover this up.
let me help you.
we could talk to them together.
they wouldn't listen to me when I was alive.
why would they listen to me now?
you could have told the truth at any time.
no one was stopping you.
no. You're wrong.
for years, all it took was one word-- Grace.
what's this gonna do to her?
I mean, I know you still love her.
you think I don't know how often you two see each other, how often you talk?
leave her out of this.
look. If you do this you're not just taking me down with you.
grace was there, too.
I didn't come asking for permission this time.
I didn't back down. I made my decision.
how do you think that went over?
why don't you tell me?
the one night that ruined my life
gave him everything--Grace
because I couldn't stand the darkness between us
a career because one man's death
drives another's decision to save lives,
as if Ryan cared about anyone else but himself.
you have to stop blaming him for something you did.
I know what I did on that road,
but I didn't do this.
I didn't kill myself.
I wasn't a drug addict.
whose life do you think would be a lot better with me gone?
are you saying Ryan killed you?
I'm dead, aren't I?
Eli.
I know how Ryan killed his friend.
now we know that Lucas was on some pretty hefty happy pills.
you mean, antidepressants.
Yes. They were in his apartment,
but he also had a prescription
for some pretty hardy tranquilizers.
now there's contraindications,
meaning that's a very bad combo.
he had to go to two pharmacies and two doctors to get them filled.
how do you know that?
I'm a doctor.
I called a few drug stores in Hamilton.
you're a ph. D. not an m. D.
I'm not named Dr. Hellar either,
but they didn't need to know that.
OK. So we know that he gave his best friend drugs.
did he have any idea that the combination would kill him?
I should have changed.
it is this guy's memorial.
it's just a get-Together with old friends.
besides, I don't think we'll be staying long.
you're not the only one who's crashing the party.
let's go.
Why? Just...
and I think in his own way
he loved every single person here,
and what I think that he would want the most
is for all of us to move forward,
to find the things that he was still searching for
with the people that we love.
grace and I are doing that.
we're getting married.
and when I say that we lost our best man,
I mean it in every sense of the word.
we all did.
to Lucas.
to Lucas! To Lucas!
want to do something,
or should I?
we should go outside and talk.
look. I know what Grace told you,
and there's a statute of limitations,
even on obsessive guilt.
you might want to restart the clock
from the time that you prescribed the medicine
that killed your friend.
tell me you didn't give him those drugs.
grace, he came to me, ok?
because he wanted to come clean.
he told you that?
Yeah. He brought me up to speed
on the plans that the two of you made together.
I met with him because he had inherited some money
and he wanted to put it into a trust account
for that man's daughter.
he figured he could do some good,
maybe get some peace.
you couldn't let him have that, could you?
you would rather see him dead.
Ah, No.
grace, wait!
you think you're the only person that cared about him?
he was my best friend.
I was just trying to make things ok.
that's all I ever did.
grace, it was our mistake that he was driving that car.
it was our fault.
that's the big secret that we never discuss.
what happened that night, Lucas?
I think you know.
you were so responsible, such a good guy until...
the party at Binghamton.
he's here, isn't he?
since seventh grade, we were best friends.
on the first day of high school,
he introduced me to the girl that he'd met over summer,
and every single day, I fell harder for her.
and nothing happened for so long...
no, man. I'm good, thanks.
until that stupid frat party
at the end of the road trip.
who was that?
here you go, Lucas.
Thanks, man.
later, I tried to act like nothing happened,
and I realized that we all were
and that Lucas knew and that's why he was drinking.
it wasn't like him.
it was our fault. We did this to him.
leaving that guy on the road,
I wasn't just protecting myself.
I was protecting all of us,
and when my best friend came to me,
falling apart after 10 years,
I just tried to do the same thing.
I tried to save him...
or at least, that's what I thought I was doing.
I didn't come asking for permission this time.
Ryan, a man died because I was drinking,
because we left him there like he was some kind of animal.
because I told you to.
look. The guy was gone.
there was nothing we could do.
he had a wife and a kid.
I can't live like this anymore.
Really? How are you gonna live in a 10x10 cell?
look. As your friend, I am begging you,
please stop torturing yourself.
if I don't do this,
I think I'm gonna die.
I can't get out of my head,
I can't sleep, I can't think.
you still seeing your shrink?
I'm done with all that.
whatever decision you make, I'm behind you,
but don't make a decision like this without a clear head.
look. You said you haven't been sleeping.
I'm gonna give you something, ok? Yeah.
you just take a couple of days.
do that for me, all right?
I told him don't mix those pills with anything.
I swear,
and when I found out that he o. D.Ed
ask him. Please, Melinda.
if Lucas is here, ask him if that is true.
he told me.
but it wasn't the pills.
it was the silence. I remember now.
late at night every night.
I hadn't slept for so long.
the pills my shrink had prescribed to me,
they weren't helping, they didn't do anything,
so what harm could a sleeping pill do?
I woke up again.
it had to have been hours since I took the first one.
why wasn't I sleeping?
I went out to my car to get headphones.
I had neighbors,
and next thing I know...
I'm standing over my own body.
I saw Grace. She looked so sad,
even before she found me.
I needed to make them understand.
the sadness, it just doesn't go away.
Lucas may not have realized it,
but I think he was trying to save you.
from what?
from making the same mistake he did.
he was afraid that if you kept
your guilt a secret it would ruin your life
the way that it ruined his.
Lucas, I'm sorry.
we are both so sorry.
I didn't see it coming.
my girlfriend, my best friend.
did you? You saw everything back in high school.
you were always so quiet,
taking it all in.
you're asking me?
what a difference 10 years makes.
what I see now is that it was an accident
the crash, your death, all of it.
you made a mistake.
it's time for you to move on
and let your friends do the same.
Mrs. Graber, these are the two people I told you about.
this is Grace, and this is Ryan.
I hope she can forgive them.
they're going to the authorities,
they're taking responsibility.
maybe that will help.
I don't think she wants revenge.
I think she wants to know what it was like for her husband in those final moments.
maybe she'll take comfort in knowing he wasn't alone.
all those years, you held it in
for Grace, for both of them.
it's all I could think about my whole adult life.
well, now you can just let go.
but what comes next?
the light.
what's that like?
I don't know.
doesn't that scare you?
the light doesn't scare me.
no, no, No.
I'm talking about the unknown.
I'm just like anyone else.
of course it scares me.
but it's ok to be scared.
take care of them, will you, all of them?
I will.
you're all right, meloony Gordon.
don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
what are you doing?
I lost your tear sheet,
so I'm kind of winging it right now.
no. I mean, I thought we were gonna wait until I got pregnant
because then we would still have 9 months.
Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan.
very logical, but, uh, didn't seem to make you very happy.
it's not you.
it's what I do.
silly fears and anxieties,
stupid things that ghosts say.
like what?
what?
that there might be a price for me to pay
for what I do, putting myself in places where I might not belong.
what kind of places?
the unknown...
death.
you know, that's exactly why we do this.
Yeah. This project, all of it.
I was wrong, you were right.
Why?
because of what you do.
every day, you know, you believe.
we should believe that the right thing
is gonna happen no matter what,
so we just keep pushing and pushing until it does.
what if it doesn't?
well, then we push some more.
where did you learn to be so brave?
where do you think?
she's right here.
nothing. Give me 360.
clear.
I see life. - Who is he?
his name's Eli James.
he's a psychology professor with a therapy practice at the university.
so I take it you haven't seen any more ghosts?
safe assumption. - That's a lie.
you can't see them, but you can hear them.
so the good news is, I'm not dead.
the bad news is, I might have to spend the rest of my life listening to people who are and helping them.
help me! Please help me! I need you to help me!
I need to help me, why won't you listen?
I know you can hear...
the ghost chatter simmered down.
it doesn't sound like the floor of the new york stock exchange in my head anymore.
but there is this one little bugger who wakes me up every night by humming.
they pester you because they're scared and no one's listening.
usually, you try to help them if they can or learn to tune them out.
and our time is up for today.
wow, blunt, to the point.
now I know how my psych patients feel.
I have someone coming to perform cpr on my computer.
and by the way, antique silk.
my tech can fix anything.
Oh, and he's even early.
Oh, only because his friends are all hanging out at the arcade later.
Oh, it's working! You're my hero.
if I'd lost the inventory, your mom would have quit.
well, the files were all there. I just had to de-frag your hard drive.
please, watch your language, we have company.
cool, you're the guy that hears ghosts.
you're Delia's kid, the one that hears about ghosts.
it's wild how you all of a sudden got the gift.
Yeah, well, don't get too excited.
there was a catch. I had to die first.
but good job on the, uh - oh, sick!
alt world 2! Is this version 5. 0?
Yeah, it still has some kinks, but if you over-clock your rig, it kicks.
the arcade's amazing.
wait, this is not the arcade where your - me and my friends, yeah.
I'm online right now.
there's my avatar.
avatar?
what is that, some sort of ancient weapon?
no, it's me or, um, what I look like in the game.
um, an animated version of me.
it could like the actual game or be a complete fantasy.
you can pick hair, skin color, clothes.
you can be anyone, do anything.
Yeah, and that is why I keep a close eye.
see? There you are.
you just went virtual.
Yeah, but I would never wear my hair like that.
your avatar does.
so instead of going to an actual place to play games -- Ooh, could you make me taller?
there are games in here.
mostly it's a place where kids go to hang out in world.
and it's educational. I mean, you can meet people from around the world.
Ned, show her.
Oh, here come the campus crusaders, or...
are they girl scouts?
the fringe girls.
they're from the Halliwell Academy, private school.
in real life, they wear uniforms.
it's like through the looking glass.
nothing is ever what it seems.
what about the guy who's standing next to him?
I mean, why is he giving Ned's avatar the evil eye?
that's Phoenix.
he's always here, always with that same geek look.
Yeah, but, I mean, you guys see the way that he's looking at Ned.
not really.
he looks the same to me.
well, how about now? I mean, he's looking right at me.
Oh, come on!
what? - What's happening? He's not moving.
his gamer must have left his machine.
didn't log off.
who are you?
who are you?!
where am I?! - Who is that? What's happening?
OK, just - just try to calm down.
where is she?!
that can't be good. - That was a ghost, right?
who-- Who are you looking for?
I don't have control!
OK, that wasn't an avatar I just heard by any chance, was it?
Yes, Phoenix, or a ghost that looked just like him.
I swear it was nothing I did.
no, it was something I did.
I just drew a ghost out of my machine.
did that ghost just trash your store because he was angry about something?
I once had a patient in therapy who compulsively smashed animal figurines.
no, he was more confused than anything.
he said he wasn't in control.
like the real world's a new kind of game to him?
Oh, that's so trippy.
is any of this even possible?
I've seen ghosts interact with electronics before, but nothing like this.
what would make a ghost decide to go into a game?
why would he come out looking like his avatar?
sometimes spirits appear as they remember themselves, so if he died playing the game, maybe he thinks he's his own avatar.
didn't I hear him say,"where is she?" means he was looking for someone.
Phoenix hangs out mostly with one of the fringe girls.
OK, where do they hang?
I'll show you. Come on.
bookstore cafe.
free Internet and half-decent coffee.
he's here.
tell me about the girl he likes.
I don't know her name, but her avatar's name is Sedona.
looks like he just found her.
Hi, honey.
wait, point me in his direction. I'm dying to ask him some questions.
he's gone and so is Sedona.
sorry, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about this ghost.
Oh, Phoenix, the avatar ghost.
Yeah. Ned says he was always online, so I'm going with the theory that he died while playing.
death by gaming o. d.
although, you know, it's very possible in college, I may have collapsed after 10 straight hours of playing asteroids.
you sure that wasn't the kegger?
I did a search for anyone who died while gaming, and suprisingly, they're a few.
I've narrowed it down to that guy, one in Korea and one in Oregon, Curtis Green.
wait, died after 5 straight days of gaming.
what, he didn't eat, he didn't sleep, he didn't drink?
Nope, he died of dehydration.
wait, shouldn't the Internet gaming people be able to tell you who Phoenix really was?
Yeah, maybe, except the only thing I could access was his avatar bio.
FYI, he's into fast cars and coldplay.
coldplay. Could be any teenager anywhere, huh?
exactly, it's the world wide web for god sakes.
he could be a 10-year-old in Siberia.
wait, what about the girl from the bookstore?
she hung out with Phoenix online.
maybe she knows something about him.
that's what I'm hoping.
that looks like the girl that Phoenix was haunting yesterday.
I'm betting that's Sedona.
and those are her laced-up pals with the tatted up avatars.
got it.
so assuming this guy died from gaming, here's what Mel's come up with.
these are from all around the world.
would the ghost have an accent? - This one didn't.
so, uh... go make nice.
see what she knows about Phoenix and this Curtis kid from Oregon.
she doesn't look much like a chit-chatter.
then use some other language.
Oh, well, that was a relatively painless inventory, besides the little computer glitch, or should I say computer ghost.
only apparently he's an out here ghost now because his avatar has not budged since yesterday.
is that what you've been watching all day?
and all night. I'm obsessed.
I mean, I have no idea how to work my own avatar, but I can't stop watching his.
I mean, I drew a spirit out of a computer game. How freaky is that?
Yeah, half the time I'm online, I am sure that there's a ghost in there.
you know, speaking metaphorically.
Yeah, well, this one might actually be.
and if he is, he's a ghost that communicates with the living, which is why I'd like to figure out what his story is.
Yeah, it sounds like maybe this guy is into cosplay, you know, people who dress up like their avatars.
no, I don't know, and how do you?
well, when you have a teenager, it's kind of dangerous not to know.
Hey, I bet you didn't know that it only takes an I. M. Chat for someone to access your webcam.
Yeah, but Ned is smarter than that.
Yeah, I know, I know.
it's just... everybody else I'm worried about.
Yes.
ha, take that, sucka!
Hey, give a newbie a break.
that was you？
it's not right.
you have mad skills and a fast machine.
my dad guilt-gifted it to me after he moved out.
sorry.
Thanks, but I'm over it.
so, uh, you're redstar?
Ned. Yeah, I've seen you in there, too.
I'm Alise.
Yeah, so you hang out with that Phoenix guy, right?
what's up with him? - Oh, don't know.
probably stopped playing and forgot to log off.
do you know the guy, the gamer?
I only know him online.
ever think something might have happened?
like I heard about that guy in Oregon who died gaming.
what, you think it could be Phoenix?
that would be so sad. I really like him.
stay away from her!
the guy who keeled, Curtis Green, died like 3 weeks ago.
well, then it's not him for sure. Phoenix just froze up yesterday.
I was hanging in world with him when it happened. - I said, leave her alone!
you, over here!
talk to me.
do you know him?
what's your game with her?
what's your game?
no, I've never seen him before. - You think you're her boyfriend?
she doesn't even have a clue who you even are.
this isn't real.
you're in a game, it's all fantasy.
she knows i'm real, that's why she talks to me.
you're real in a sense, yes.
but that is not the issue.The issue is, who am I talking to?!
I'm Phoenix, ok?
that's all you need to know. Now leave us alone!
it's the classic case of grandiose delusional disorder.
he believes he's her boyfriend, and she's the perfect target-- sweet, shy, troubled, and she lives online.
and how do you usually treat something like this?
change their frame of reference.
jar them out of their fiction.
like tell him who he actually is?
that's a good start, if we knew who he really is.
well, could we track his IP address through the game?
Hey, they did it on CSI!
I think there'd have to be a criminal investigation.
or we could just... talk to someone where he lives, in here.
he's gone!
Phoenix isn't there anymore. I've been watching since he first came out.
he's been frozen.
he was right there!
he was in there.
what happened? Your avatar started to move.
because I was in there, too. I had a vision.
only, it was different.
it was like I was a part of that world, you know?
I think I was seeing the game the way that he does.
OK, I don't like the idea of that guy in your head.
me either. But if we want to find out who Phoenix is or why he's haunting alise, it might be the only way.
Hey, I'm looking for Phoenix.
he was just here.
are you friends with him?
who wants to know?
you don't belong here.
you don't belong here, either just tell me who you are.
No!
you're ruining everything!
this wasn't real when you were alive, and it's not real now.
there has to be somebody in your real life that you want to talk to.
I can help you!
all right, that's enough!
I don't think so.
if you see a light, pal, go for it.
no way!
OK, that's enough fun.
it was...
everything in there, it was real for my ghost.
you were kickin' some ass.
I was, right?
looked like he landed a few good hits, too.
looked like he was kind of hurting you.
no. I mean, I felt it in the game, but not now.
Hey, his avatar's gone again.
that's ok.
he'll be back. It's the only way he can talk to Alise.
that's not the only way he can be with her.
he's a ghost.
how can we find a guy who doesn't want to be found?
we get lucky.
looks like Phoenix sent you an email.
you want to know me better? Let' meet. I don't understand. Now he wants me to find him?
he's a gamer.
maybe he likes to play games.
OK then.
let's play.
sure! Where should we meet? No good.
guess it would be, seeing how the guy is dead.
some kind of business address.
Ingram, Nash, Reynolds, Coben and company.
that's an ad firm in hamilton.
so our dead guy's this Berrit dude?
OK, you go see if Phoenix ever sent Alise any emails from this address.
we'll see if we can find our ghost.
never heard of him.
is he one of those guys who died gaming?
no, he's just someone I met in-world.
you spend too much time online.
I wish I could spend that much time online.
my mom thinks the Internet's evil.
did you want something? - Oh, no, thanks.
mine's the opposite.
Oh, your mom?
with the web, she's cool, but she doesn't trust me to blow my nose out here in the real world.
well, it would be worse if your parents didn't care, right?
Yeah, I've got one of them, too.
anyway, at least I have my online friends I can gripe to.
OK, but how do you know they're your friends?
you don't really know who they are.
I don't really know you.
true that.
I think you get to know who people really are more online.
barriers come down.
I guess, but...
what about when it goes offline, and it's not what you thought?
have you ever had a thing go offline?
I've emailed, talked on cell, sure.
you felt safe doing that?
safe as anything in real life turned out to be.
you mean, like your family?
thought we'd always be together.
then one day I come home, and it's gone.
no more.
at least with this, I can always count on it being there.
Mr. Berrit...
no, sorry, he's not with the firm.
well, I know he wouldn't be anymore, but did he ever work here?
wait, do you mean Errit, Mr. Bill Errit?
he's in now.
isn't he supposed to be dead?
Curioser and curioser.
Oh, god, not again.
I thought I was through with this.
with what?
about 2 weeks ago, the FBI shows up here.
accuses me of cyber-stalking-- Luring underage girls and transmitting pornography.
so you didn't send the email? - of course not.
someone stole my address, and the guy who did's a real winner, judging from the stuff they thought I did.
what kind of stuff?
he deals in candid, suggestive photos of beautiful young women.
of teenagers, mostly.
God knows how he gets them to do it.
cops said some of them even send in webcam shots of themselves.
I saw the stuff, and I wish I hadn't.
so the guy who sent me the email, he's a predator?
and a good one.
they've traced stolen emails to him all across the country, but he's always gone by the time they get there.
that's the agent handling the case.
if this pervert's after you now, I'd call him.
can't be too sad when a perv bites it.
Yeah, except it doesn't change anything.
I mean, the ghost controls a computer.
it can get young girls to do things, like maybe even turn on a webcam.
well, I know a cop.
I used to help her profile some cases.
let me call her.
look, whoever created Phoenix is a cyber-perv.
he gets pics of teens and puts them on the web!
OK, but if the FBI is handling this case, why are you talking to me?
because I don't know them. I know you.
and you owe me, remember?
what?
Oh, um, the I. D. thief I helped you profile?
fine.
I will try to subpoena the game for an email ID.
but don't get your hopes up. These guys switch servers all the time.
internet cafes, motels, your random, roaming wi-fi.
so even if we get an address, I doubt the guy will still be there unless he's dead.
Yeah, I'm gonna be a little late.
it turns out this ghost is a total creep, so.
uh, you know what?
I'm gonna have to call you back.
I want you to stay the hell away from Alise.
No! I told you - Save it.
I know who you are.
I know what you've done to those girls, I know that you've tried to ruin their lives, and you're doing the same thing to alise.
I would never-- Yeah, but you did!
again and again.
I mean, you had to have known better, but you didn't stop, not even after you died.
you're still still stalking Alise.
you're confused.
you don't know who I am.
I just want to protect her.
did you have a good day? Yeah!
get your travel shoes on.
I know where the real Phoenix lives.
let's go.
of course he said he was protecting Alise.
he might even believe it.
the guy's a sicko.
is that a technical term?
Oh, I'm sorry. Twisted sicko.
I don't know, it felt sincere.
welcome to his world of deception.
these guys find out people's weaknesses, and they prey on it.
what's my weakness?
trusting sickos.
Oh, come on - Come on.
we're just going to help ourselves?
not so sure this is such a good idea.
I'm thinking it may be time to call in a higher power-- Shh.
like maybe...the cops.
OK, from the smell, I'm guessing that guy is not asleep.
that's the real Phoenix.
did I call it?
it's a twisted sicko.
something's not right.
Oh, my god.
he was telling the truth.
he really did just want to protect alise. I mean, all of these photos are her.
he's not a predator.
he's Larry Jones, Alise's dad.
Yeah, it was an apparent heart attack. They think he's been dead 3 days.
so that's when the ghost must have gone into the computer.
so he's protecting his daughter, but from what?
and why was he even in the computer?
that's just-- I don't know, but he does.
it's the only way I could be a part of her life.
I had a stupid affair.
my wife was bitter, and it rubbed off on Alise.
my daughter made it clear she didn't want to have anything to do with me, and I didn't blame her for hating me, but...
God, I missed her.
that's when you came up with Phoenix.
well, in there, I felt connected to her.
then what happened?
well, after I died, I found myself back at home with Alise, and I saw that she was emailing someone.
someone in the game?
Yeah, she met him in there.
I mean, I was Phoenix, and Phoenix was her friend, but this guy was...more.
I mean, the emails were pretty intimate.
so you suspected he was a predator?
or a lusty teenager. I didn't know.
I mean, I didn't know if I was being an overprotective dad.
like when you threw me across the street in the game.
look, I just didn't want you to blow my cover with this creep.
but then when I realized that you were actually trying to help, that's when I forwarded you on the emails that this guy sent Alise.
the ones we traced.
so the guy who sent the emails, he was the same guy that the cops wanted for teen porn?
and when you found that out, I went back in the game and I tried to warn her, but she was convinced that he was just a...
happy teen, just like she was, and she would not listen to me.
it wasn't always like that.
I mean, we used to do things.
we used to laugh.
I know.
I saw your pictures.
the one in the jeep?
Yeah.
we took that in Sedona.
she said that we were the Indiana Joneses.
we ran up this hill looking for treasure, and we came down with this leather pouch full of-- I mean, I don't know what.
rocks and feathers and dirt and... she said it was magic.
and that it would protect us forever.
look, you have to warn her.
you have to tell her to be careful.
please.
don't worry.
come on.
excuse me... Alise, hi.
I'm Melinda Gordon.
I knew your dad, and I'm so sorry.
what's this about?
I think your daughter might be in danger.
well, the police didn't say anything about that.
that's because they don't know about it.
the predators reached out to Alise online.
he collects pictures of young girls.
who are you?
I know this is a bad time. - I asked you a question.
look, I...
we, um, talk to spirits, and Alise's dad contacted me, so
OK, that's enough. My daughter just lost her dad, so whatever your story is, tell it to the police.
follow them!
tell them!
what do you want me to say? That her dad is a ghost avatar?
it'll never work.
there's only one thing that will.
what?
we find this guy and we stop him.
are we ready yet?
you're set. All you need to do is get him to email you, then Eli's friend can track the IP.
and wherever that is, Sam said the FBI can send someone there fast.
whoa, that's me?
you said you want to lure him, didn't you?
this I gotta see. There's Alise's avatar, and that's Cal.
that's who I'm looking for?
I think so.
the avatar Alise is talking to, he's the guy you saw in the game the other day.
same guy.
are you ready?
you're my only way in.
OK.
let's catch a predator.
It's...a private chatroom!
you can't get in!
all right, I get it, minus an eardrum.
well, what are you waiting for?
give him your email, for god sakes.
be brazen. There's no dating protocol there.
how do we even know he heard me?
we wait.
Hey, dude.
Hey, man, let's get out of here.
thanks for picking us up.
Cal. Where are you?
I didn't see you in there.
I'm outside.
Oh, snap.
I was inside looking for you, but my friends made me bail.
I was wearing a red shirt.
geek, you didn't see me? You know what I look like. I sent you that picture.
no.
but a bunch of us are going to the dance pad contest later at brookside mall.
how does that sound?
well, I don't know, I don't have a car.
I do. I'll pick you up.
you're the Jones that lives on Latimer Road, right?
wow, you do your homework.
what can I say?
I like you.
so I'll be there at 6: 00.
sure.
C U THEN?
is he still there?
no, he left.
maybe he's at the virtual cafe.
no, he's not.
Cal and Alise have both logged off, so what do we do now?
we wait for him to email melinda's avatar back.
no, I can't wait!
look, he wants pictures.
all it takes is one weak moment, and she's very vulnerable right now.
which is why you have to keep an eye on her.
OK, let us know if he contacts her again.
get a cell phone number, email address, anything.
OK, ok, ok.
go watch your girl.
we're gonna get this guy, we are.
are we?
it's looking more promising.
check this out, just came in.
obviously he read my cry for help.
got his service provider.
Eli's cop friend just needs to track his IP.
hopefully before he moves again.
detective Sam Blair, please.
can't believe he's in Grandview.
Yeah, where's the FBI, the camera, the balloons?
we're about to catch a predator in our hometown.
look, after that last false alarm, you're lucky I'm even here.
he's a regular. About a day every month.
brings his laptop, says he likes quiet.
sounds like a cyber criminal or a cheating spouse.
would you mind opening it, please?
OK, maybe you were right.
or maybe you were.
looks like we found his private stash.
he's here for Alise.
all right, I'm going to need address, phone numbers, and nobody touch anything else in here.
Hey, Cal, what's up? Where are you?
home.
my brother's not back with my mom's car.
bummer. - I know.
this thing's starting in 20. We're all headin' over.
OK, well, have fun.
no, freak, I'm tryin' to tell you, my brother's near your house.
he'll probably drive by on his way home.
well, I don't know.
Oh, right.
you probably need to ask your mom first.
no, it's not that.
it's just-- sorry, my friends are here.
I can't hear.
whatever you decide's OK.
we got in touch with the mom.
Alise was supposed to be home, but she hasn't been answering her cell.
has anyone checked the house?
a patrol car's driving by now.
they're in a blue minivan.
I am never going to get used to that.
what?
that I forgot to tell you that the predator's driving a blue minivan.
license Number GRK998.
license Plate Number GRK998.
OK.
not sure how you forgot that, but I'll tell them.
look, you don't understand, he's there now.
he's picking her up, now, now!
OK, just-- please go and tell Sam that he's already there.
don't worry, all right?
the police are on their way.
you must be Alise.
I'm Cal's brother. Hop in.
we'll pick up the others on the way.
what's wrong?
well, it's just, um... I just...I don't know.
Ah, I get it.
you're not sure you should go anywhere with the big bad brother.
no, it's not that.
it's just... well, I don't know you.
it's cool.
Brian told me how your mom has you on a short leash. I get it.
I'm older, practically an only kid.
you just want to say,"hey,"I have a brain, I can think for myself.
Yeah, that's for sure.
look, maybe when your mom gets home, she can drive you over.
Yeah.
Ugh, yeah, she's... whatever.
anyway, I,uh, I gotta get going.
little bro's gonna be pissed if I make him late, so.
you comin'?
Yeah.
um, just wait one sec.
all set?
get out! Get out of the car!
ready. - Get out!
Alise, no.
No! No! No! Alise, no!
they just left, you can catch them.
I've been calling her on her cell. She's not picking up.
no, no, no, they're not in there!
they're in a van, a blue van!
Argh, this is not happening!
Sam said there's no word yet.
she's in the car.
I don't know what to do, I'm completely helpless!
I just don't know how to protect her.
OK, where are they? Where were they heading?
they started toward Brookside, and they turned off the highway.
I'll tell sam. - There's still something you can do.
no, no, she got in the car!
I couldn't stop her!
Yeah, but you can stop him.
Hello, I tried!
I'm a ghost, people walk through me!
I know that, but you're the only one who can help Alise right now.
look, you love your little girl.
OK, now believe that you can do this.
you have the power to stop him.
this isn't Brookside.
I think you should let me out here.
what are you-- Oh.
look, no one made you get in this car.
you wanted to.
relax, it's only pictures.
I didn't know. - Oh, come on!
you knew.
let's not pretend.
you knew...
daddy's dead. He can't help you anymore.
hazard, hazard.
stop the car. Stop the car.
at the end of the road - What is going on?
did you touch something?
I don't - Turn around when possible.
come here.
get away! No way in hell!
you gotta be kidding me.
OK, all right, OK!
on the ground, on the ground now! - OK!
let me see your hands!
it's ok, sweetheart.
thank god you're OK.
Thanks.
so the FBI's been tracking this guy for over a year.
how'd you get all this information?
I do what any good shrink does-- I talk to ghosts.
I do, really.
no, one showed up last night. It...
I don't know how or why you dud what you did, but I'll never be able to thank you enough.
it wasn't me.
it was your husband.
I don't understand.
it's ok.
I'll explain later.
I didn't realize how insignificant Alise felt after the divorce, so I guess I was just too busy trying to get through another day.
OK, mom, enough sharing.
I think I need a minute alone.
sure.
that was him, wasn't it?
he did all those things in the car?
Yes.
and he's here with us right now.
he can hear you.
he told me about the day that you filled that.
he said you-- you thought it was magic.
because we did it together.
and then he left.
he fought for me today, but why didn't he fight for me back then?
why did he just leave?
tell her-- tell her I'm sorry.
I did fight. I just...
it was too little, too late.
he's sorry.
he never wanted to not be a part of your life.
is that true?
Yes.
tell her, tell her what I did.
he was your friend in the game.
he was Phoenix. He created that avatar just so he could be with you.
my dad?
he hates computers. He can hardly work a cell phone.
well, he figured out now , just to be with you.
wish I could stay now.
I love you, too, daddy.
he sees the light and now that he knows you're safe, he can go.
thank you.
tell him good-bye.
it's ok.
she's gonna be fine, she's gonna be fine.
Sam offered me a job.
And?
I said I was happy shrinking heads and sending disembodied voices into the light.
come on.
you know, you've got to stop telling everybody that you can hear ghosts.
Why? No one believes me.
people are gonna start thinking you're nuts.
trust me, I've been there.
people think I'm nuts already.
give me 360.
clear? - Clear.
he's alive.
who is he?
his name's Eli James.
he is a psychology professor with a therapy practice at the university.
so I take it you haven't seen any more ghosts?
safe assumption. - That's a lie!
you can't see them, but you can hear them.
so the good news is, I am not dead.
the bad news is I am going to spend the rest of my life listening to people who are and helping them.
please help me.
I need you to help me.
why wouldn't you just listen?
I know you can hear...
the ghost chatter is somewhat down. Doesn't sound like the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in my head any more.
but there is this one little bugger who speaks up every night by humming.
sounds like you have a new since ghost, they pass to you, because they are scared and no one's listening.
usually you try to help them as they can or learn to tune them out and our time is up for today.
wow, what?
now I know how my psych patients feel?
I have someone coming to perform CPR on my computer and by the way, antique store.
my tech can fix anything.
Oh, and he's even early.
only because all his friends are hanging out at the arcade leader.
Oh, it's working.
you're my hero.
if I lost the inventory, your mom would quit.
the files are all there, and I just have to defrag your hard drives.
please watch your language, we have company.
Ned, Eli. Eli, Ned.
cool. You are the guy who hears the ghosts.
you're Delia's kid, the one who hears about the ghosts.
it's wild you all of a sudden get the gifts.
Yeah. Well, don't get too excited. There was a catch.
I had to die first.
but good job on the Alt world-2.
is this version high for now?
Yeah, sort of kinks...
but if you overclock your rig, it kicks.
your kid's amazing...
wait, this is not the archive you are.
me and my friends, yeah.
I am online right now.
that's my avatar.
avatar?
what is that? Some sort of ancient weapon?
no, it's me, or what I look like in the game, an animated version.
it could look like... - The actual game or be a complete fantasy.
you can pick hair, skin colour, clothes, and you can be anyone do anything.
Yeah, that's why I keep a closed eye.
see, there you are.
you just went virtual.
Yeah, but I'll never wear my hair like that your avatar does.
so instead of going to an actual place to play games.
Ooh, could you make me taller?
there are games in here.
mostly it's a place where kids go to hang out in world.
and it's educational.
I mean, you can meet people from around the world.
Ned, show her.
Oh, here come the campus crusaders,
or...
are they girl scouts?
the fringe girls. They're from the Halliwell Academy, private school. In real life, they wear uniforms.
it's like through the looking glass.
nothing is ever what it seems.
what about the guy who's standing next to him?
I mean, why is he giving Ned's avatar the evil eye?
that's Phoenix. He's always here, always with that same geek look.
Yeah, but, I mean, you guys see the way that he's looking at Ned.
not really.
he looks the same to me.
well, how about now?
I mean, he's looking right at me.
Oh, come on!
what?
what's happening? He's not moving.
his gamer must have left his machine.
didn't log off.
who are you?
who are you?! Where am I?!
who is that? What's happening?
OK, just--just try to calm down.
where is she?!
that can't be good. - That was a ghost, right?
Who？Who are you looking for?
I don't have control!
OK, that wasn't an avatar I just heard by any chance, was it?
Yes, Phoenix, or a ghost that looked just like him.
I swear it was nothing I did.
no, it was something I did.
I just drew a ghost out of my machine.
did that ghost just trash your store because he was angry about something?
I once had a patient in therapy who compulsively smashed animal figurines.
no, he was more confused than anything.
he said he wasn't in control.
like the real world's a new kind of game to him?
Oh, that's so trippy.
is any of this even possible?
I've seen ghosts interact with electronics before, but nothing like this.
what would make a ghost decide to go into a game?
why would he come out looking like his avatar?
sometimes spirits appear as they remember themselves, so if he died playing the game, maybe he thinks he's his own avatar.
didn't I hear him say, "where is she?"
means he was looking for someone.
Phoenix hangs out mostly with one of the fringe girls.
OK, where do they hang?
I'll show you. Come on.
bookstore cafe.
free internet and half-decent coffee.
he's here.
tell me about the girl he likes.
I don't know her name, but her avatar's name is Sedona.
looks like he just found her.
Hi, honey.
wait, point me in his direction.
I'm dying to ask him some questions.
he's gone，and so is Sedona.
sorry, I couldn't sleep.
I kept thinking about this ghost.
Oh, Phoenix, the avatar ghost.
Ned says he was always online,
so I'm going with the theory that he died while playing.
death by gaming O. D. Wow.
although, you know, it's very possible in college.
I may have collapsed after 10 straight hours of playing asteroids.
you sure that wasn't the kegger?
I did a search for anyone who died while gaming, and suprisingly, there're a few.
I've narrowed it down to that guy, one in Korea and one in Oregon, Curtis Green.
wait, died after 5 straight days of gaming. Huh.
what, he didn't eat, he didn't sleep, he didn't drink?
Nope, he died of dehydration.
wait, shouldn't the internet gaming people be able to tell you who Phoenix really was?
Yeah, maybe, except the only thing I could access was his avatar bio.
FYI, he's into fast cars and coldplay.
coldplay. Could be any teenager anywhere, huh?
exactly, it's the world wide web for god sakes.
he could be a 10-year-old in Siberia.
wait, what about the girl from the bookstore?
she hung out with Phoenix online.
maybe she knows something about him.
that's what I'm hoping.
that looks like the girl that Phoenix was haunting yesterday.
I'm betting that's Sedona.
and those are her laced-up pals with the tatted up avatars. Got it.
so assuming this guy died from gaming.
here's what Mel's come up with.
these are from all around the world.
would the ghost have an accent?
this one didn't.
so, uh...
go make nice. See what she knows about Phoenix and this Curtis kid from Oregon.
she doesn't look much like a chit-chatter.
then use some other language.
Oh, well, that was a relatively painless inventory, besides the little computer glitch, or should I say computer ghost.
only apparently he's an out here ghost now because his avatar has not budged since yesterday.
is that what you've been watching all day and all night? I'm obsessed.
I mean, I have no idea how to work my own avatar,
but I can't stop watching his.
I mean, I drew a spirit out of a computer game. How freaky is that?
Yeah, half the time I'm online.
I am sure that there's a ghost in there.
you know, speaking metaphorically.
Yeah, well, this one might actually be. And if he is, he's a ghost that communicates with the living, which is why I'd like to figure out what his story is.
Yeah, it sounds like maybe this guy is into cosplay,
you know, people who dress up like their avatars.
no, I don't know, and how do you?
well, when you have a teenager, it's kind of dangerous not to know.
Hey, I bet you did't know that it only takes an I. M. Chat for someone to access your webcam.
Yeah, but Ned is smarter than that.
Yeah, I know, I know. It's just...
everybody else I'm worried about.
ha, take that, sucka!
Hey, give a newbie a break.
it's not right.
you have mad skills and a fast machine.
my dad guilt-gifted it to me after he moved out.
sorry.
Thanks, but I'm over it.
so, uh, you're red star?
Ned. Yeah, I've seen you in there, too.
I'm Alise.
Yeah, so you hang out with that Phoenix guy, right?
what's up with him? - Oh, don't know.
probably stopped playing and forgot to log off.
do you know the guy, the gamer?
I only know him online.
ever think something might have happened? Like I heard about that guy in Oregon who died gaming.
what, you think it could be Phoenix?
that would be so sad. I really like him.
stay away from her!
the guy who keeled, Curtis Green, died like 3 weeks ago.
well, then it's not him for sure.
Phoenix just froze up yesterday.
I was hanging in world with him when it happened.
I said, leave her alone!
you, over here! Talk to me.
do you know him?
what's your game with her?
what's your game?
no, I've never seen him before.
you think you're her boyfriend?
she doesn't even have a clue who you even are.
this isn't real.
you're in a game, it's all fantasy.
she knows I'm real. That's why she talks to me.
you're real in a sense, Yes. But that is not the issue.
the issue is, who am I talking to?!
I'm Phoenix, ok?
that's all you need to know. Now leave us alone!
it's the classic case of grandiose delusional disorder.
he believes he's her boyfriend,
and she's the perfect target...
sweet, shy, troubled,
and she lives online.
and how do you usually treat something like this?
change their frame of reference.
jar them out of their fiction.
like tell him who he actually is?
that's a good start, If we knew who he really is.
well, could we track his I. P. address through the game?
Hey, they did it on CSI!
I think there'd have to be a criminal investigation.
or we could just talk to someone where he lives, in here.
he's gone!
Phoenix isn't there anymore.
I've been watching since he first came out.
he's been frozen. He was right there!
he was in there.
what happened? Your avatar started to move.
because I was in there, too. I had a vision.
only, it was different.
it was like I was a part of that world, you know?
I think I was seeing the game the way that he does.
OK, I don't like the idea of that guy in your head.
me either.
but if we want to find out who Phoenix is, or why he's haunting Alise.
it might be the only way.
Hey, I'm looking for Phoenix.
he was just here.
are you friends with him?
who wants to know?
you don't belong here.
you don't belong here, either.
just tell me who you are.
No! You're ruining everything!
this wasn't real when you were alive,
and it's not real now.
there has to be somebody in your real life that you want to talk to.
I can help you!
all right, that's enough!
I don't think so.
if you see a light, pal, go for it.
no way!
Melinda!
OK, that's enough fun.
it was...everything in there, it was real for my ghost.
you were kickin' some ass.
I was, right?
looked like he landed a few good hits, too.
looked like he was kind of hurting you.
no. I mean, I felt it in the game, but not now.
Hey, his avatar's gone again.
that's ok. He'll be back.
it's the only way he can talk to Alise.
that's not the only way he can be with her.
he's a ghost.
how can we find a guy who doesn't want to be found?
we get lucky.
looks like Phoenix sent you an email.
I don't understand. Now he wants me to find him?
he's a gamer. Maybe he likes to play games.
OK. Then let's play.
no good.
guess it would be, seeing how the guy is dead.
some kind of business address.
Ingram, Nash, Reynolds, Coben and company.
that's an ad firm in Hamilton.
so our dead guy's this Berrit dude?
OK, you go see if Phoenix ever sent Alise any emails from this address.
we'll see if we can find our ghost.
Berrit, incr-c. com? Never heard of him.
is he one of those guys who died gaming?
no, he's just someone I met in-world.
you spend too much time online.
I wish I could spend that much time online.
my mom thinks the Internet is evil.
did you want something?
Oh, no, thanks.
mine's the opposite. - Oh, your mom?
with the web, she's cool.
but she doesn't trust me to blow my nose out here in the real world.
well, it would be worse if your parents didn't care, right?
Yeah, I've got one of them, too.
anyway, at least I have my online friends I can gripe to.
OK, but how do you know they're your friends?
you don't really know who they are.
I don't really know you.
true that.
I think you get to know who people really are more online.
barriers come down.
I guess, but...
what about when it goes offline, and it's not what you thought?
have you ever had a thing go offline?
I've emailed, talked on cell, sure.
you felt safe doing that?
safe as anything in real life turned out to be.
you mean, like your family?
thought we'd always be together.
then one day I come home, and it's gone.
no more.
at least with this, I can always count on it being there.
Mr. Berrit...
no, sorry, he's not with the firm.
well, I know he wouldn't be anymore, but did he ever work here?
wait, do you mean Errit, Mr. Bill Errit?
he's in now.
isn't he supposed to be dead?
Curioser and curioser.
Oh, god, not again.
I thought I was through with this.
with what?
about 2 weeks ago, the FBI shows up here.
accuses me of cyber-stalking, luring underage girls and transmitting pornography.
so you didn't send the email?
of course not. Someone stole my address.
and the guy who did's a real winner, judging from the stuff they thought I did.
what kind of stuff?
he deals in candid, suggestive photos of beautiful young women. Of teenagers, mostly.
God knows how he gets them to do it.
cops said some of them even end in webcam shots of themselves.
I saw the stuff, and I wish I hadn't.
so the guy who sent me the email, he's a predator?
and a good one.
they've traced stolen emails to him all across the country,
but he's always gone by the time they get there.
that's the agent handling the case.
if this pervert's after you now, I'd call him.
can't be too sad when a perv bites it.
Yeah, except it doesn't change anything.
I mean, the ghost controls a computer.
it can get young girls to do things, like maybe even turn on a webcam.
well, I know a cop.
I used to help her profile some cases.
let me call her.
look, whoever created Phoenix is a cyber-perv.
he gets pics of teens and puts them on the web!
OK, but if the FBI is handling this case,
why are you talking to me?
because I don't know them. I know you.
and you owe me, remember?
what?
Oh, um, the I. D. thief I helped you profile?
fine. I will try to subpoena the game for an email ID.
but don't get your hopes up.
these guys switch servers all the time.
internet cafes, motels,
your random, roaming WI-FI.
so even if we get an address, I doubt the guy will still be there.
unless he's dead.
Yeah, I'm gonna be a little late.
it turns out this ghost is a total creep, so...
uh, you know what?
I'm gonna have to call you back.
I want you to stay the hell away from Alise.
No! I told you
save it. I know who you are.
I know what you've done to those girls,
I know that you've tried to ruin their lives,
and you're doing the same thing to Alise.
I would never... - Yeah, but you did!
again and again.
I mean, you had to have known better,
but you didn't stop, not even after you died.
you're still stalking Alise.
you're confused.
you don't know who I am.
I just want to protect her.
did you have a good day?
Yeah!
get your travel shoes on.
I know where the real Phoenix lives.
let's go.
of course he said he was protecting Alise.
he might even believe it.
the guy's a sicko.
is that a technical term?
Oh, I'm sorry. Twisted sicko.
I don't know, it felt sincere.
welcome to his world of deception.
these guys find out people's weaknesses, and they prey on it.
what's my weakness?
trusting sickos.
Oh, come on...
come on.
we're just going to help ourselves?
not so sure this is such a good idea.
I'm thinking it may be time - to call in a higher power... - Shh.
like maybe... the cops.
OK, from the smell,
I'm guessing that guy is not asleep.
that's the real Phoenix.
did I call it?
it's a twisted sicko.
something's not right.
Oh, my god.
he was telling the truth.
he really did just want to protect Alise.
I mean, all of these photos are her.
he's not a predator.
he's Larry Jones, Alise's dad.
you think he's been dead for what?
Yeah, it was an apparenent heart attack.
they think he's been dead 3 days.
so that's when the ghost must have gone into the computer.
so he's protecting his daughter, but from what?
and why was he even in the computer? That's just...
I don't know, but he does.
it's the only way I could be a part of her life.
I had a stupid affair.
my wife was bitter, and it rubbed off on Alise.
my daughter made it clear she didn't want to have anything to do with me,
and I didn't blame her for hating me, but...
God, I missed her.
that's when you came up with Phoenix.
well, in there, I felt connected to her.
then what happened?
well, after I died, I found myself back at home with Alise, and I saw that she was emailing someone.
someone in the game?
Yeah, she met him in there.
I mean, I was Phoenix, and Phoenix was her friend.
but this guy was... more.
I mean, the emails were pretty intimate.
so you suspected he was a predator?
or a lusty teenager. I didn't know.
I mean, I didn't know if I was being an overprotective dad.
like when you threw me across the street in the game.
look, I just didn't want you to blow my cover with this creep.
but then when I realized that you were actually trying to help,
that's when I forwarded you on the emails that this guy sent Alise.
the ones we traced.
so the guy who sent the emails, he was the same guy that the cops wanted for teen porn?
and when you found that out,
I went back in the game and I tried to warn her, but she s convinced that he was just a...
happy teen, just like she was, and she would not listen to me.
it wasn't always like that.
I mean, we used to do things.
we used to laugh.
I know.
I saw your pictures.
the one in the jeep?
Yeah.
we took that in Sedona.
she said that we were the Indiana Joneses.
we ran up this hill looking for treasure, and we came down with this leather pouch full of...
I mean, I don't know what.
rocks and feathers and dirt and...
she said it was magic.
and that it would protect us forever.
look, you have to warn her.
you have to tell her to be careful.
please.
don't worry.
come on.
excuse me...
Alise, hi. I'm Melinda Gordon.
I knew your dad, and I'm so sorry.
what's this about?
I think your daughter might be in danger.
well, the police didn't say anything about that.
that's because they don't know about it.
the predators reached out to Alise online.
he collects pictures of young girls.
who are you?
I know this is a bad time.
I asked you a question.
look, I...
we, um, talk to spirits,
and Alise's dad contacted me, so...
OK, that's enough.
my daughter just lost her dad,
so whatever your story is, tell it to the police.
follow them! Tell them!
what do you want me to say?
that her dad is a ghost avatar?
it'll never work.
there's only one thing that will.
what?
we find this guy and we stop him.
are we ready yet?
you're set. All you need to do is get him to email you, then Eli's friend can track the I. P.
and wherever that is, Sam said the FBI can send someone there fast.
whoa, that's me?
you said you want to lure him, didn't you?
this I gotta see.
there's Alise's avatar.
and that's Cal.
that's who I'm looking for?
I think so. The avatar Alise is talking to, he's the guy you saw in the game the other day.
same guy.
are you ready? You're my only way in.
OK.
let's catch a predator.
Melinda, Melinda!
It's...a...private chatroom!
you can't get in!
all right, I get it, minus an eardrum.
well, what are you waiting for?
give him your email, for god sakes.
be brazen. There's no dating protocol there.
how do we even know he heard me?
we wait.
Hey, dude.
second hey, man, let's get out of here.
thanks for picking us up.
Cal. Hey. Where are you?
I didn't see you in there.
I'm outside.
Oh, snap. I was inside looking for you, but my friends made me bail.
I was wearing a red shirt.
geek, you didn't see me? You know what I look like.
I sent you that picture.
no. But a bunch of us are going to the dance pad contest later at Brookside Mall.
how does that sound?
well, I don't know, I don't have a car.
I do. I'll pick you up.
you're the Jones that lives on Latimer Road, right?
wow, you do your homework.
what can I say? I like you.
so I'll be there at 6: 00.
is he still there?
no, he left.
maybe he's at the virtual cafe.
no, he's not.
Cal and Alise have both logged off,
so what do we do now?
we wait for him to email Melinda's avatar back.
no, I can't wait!
look, he wants pictures.
all it takes is one weak moment, and she's very vulnerable right now.
which is why you have to keep an eye on her.
OK, let us know if he contacts her again.
get a cell phone number, email address, anything.
OK, ok, ok.
go watch your girl.
we're gonna get this guy, we are.
are we?
it's looking more promising.
check this out, just came in.
obviously he read my cry for help.
got his service provider.
Eli's cop friend just needs to track his I. P.
hopefully before he moves again.
detective Sam Blair, please.
I can't believe he's in Grandview.
Yeah, where's the FBI, the camera, the balloons?
we're about to catch a predator in our hometown.
look, after that last false alarm,
you're lucky I'm even here.
he's a regular. About a day every month.
brings his laptop, says he likes quiet.
sounds like a cyber criminal or a cheating spouse.
would you mind opening it, please?
OK, maybe you were right.
or maybe you were.
looks like we found his private stash.
he's here for Alise.
all right, I'm going to need address, phone numbers, and nobody touch anything else in here.
Hey, Cal, what's up? Where are you?
home. My brother's not back with my mom's car.
bummer.
I know. This thing's starting in 20.
we're all headin' over.
OK, well, have fun.
no, freak, I'm tryin' to tell you,
my brother's near your house.
he'll probably drive by on his way home.
well, I don't know.
Oh, right.
you probably need to ask your mom first.
no, it's not that. It's just...
sorry, my friends are here.
I can't hear.
whatever you decide's ok.
we got in touch with the mom.
Alise was supposed to be home, but she hasn't been answering her cell.
has anyone checked the house?
a patrol car's driving by now.
they're in a blue minivan.
I am never going to get used to that.
what?
that I forgot to tell you that the predator's driving a blue minivan.
license number GRK998.
license plate number GRK998.
OK. Not sure how you forgot that, but I'll tell them.
look, you don't understand, he's there now.
he's picking her up, now, now!
OK, just... please go and tell Sam that he's already there.
don't worry, all right?
the police are on their way.
you must be Alise. I'm Cal's brother.
hop in. We'll pick up the others on the way.
what's wrong? - Well, it's just, I just... I don't know.
Ah, I get it.
you're not sure you should go anywhere with the big bad brother.
no, it's not that.
it's just... well, I don't know you.
it's cool. Cal told me How your mom has you on a short leash.
I get it. I'm older, practically an only kid.
you just want to say, hey, I have a brain, I can think for myself.
Yeah, that's for sure.
look, maybe when your mom gets home, she can drive you over.
Yeah. Yeah, she's...whatever.
anyway, I, uh, I gotta get going.
little bro's gonna be pissed if I make him late,
So...you comin'?
Yeah. Um, just wait one sec.
all set?
get out!
get out of the car!
ready.
get out! Alise, No. No!
No! Alise!
they just left, you can catch them.
I've been calling her on her cell. She's not picking up.
no, no, no, they're not in there!
they're in a van, a blue van!
Argh, this is not happening!
Sam said there's no word yet.
she's in the car.
I don't know what to do, I'm completely helpless!
I just don't know how to protect her.
OK, where are they? Where were they heading?
they started toward Brookside, and they turned off the highway.
I'll tell Sam.
there's still something you can do.
no, no, she got in the car!
I couldn't stop her!
Yeah, but you can stop him.
Hello, I tried!
I'm a ghost, people walk through me!
I know that, but you're the only one who can help Alise right now.
look, you love your little girl.
OK, now believe that you can do this.
you have the power to stop him.
this isn't Brookside.
I think you should me out here.
huh? What are you...
look, no one made you get in this car.
you wanted to.
relax, it's only pictures.
I didn't know.
Oh, come on! You knew.
let's not pretend. You knew.
daddy's dead.
he can't help you anymore.
hazard, hazard. Stop the car.
stop the car.
at the end of the road
what is going on?
did you touch something? - I don't.
turn left now.
Oh! What the
come here.
get away!
no way in hell!
you gotta be kidding me.
Freeze! Don't move!
all right, ok!
on the ground, on the ground now!
OK!
let me see your hands!
it's ok, sweetheart.
thank god you're ok.
Thanks.
so the FBI's been tracking this guy for over a year.
how'd you get all this information?
I do what any good shrink does.
I talk to ghosts.
I do, really.
no, one showed up last night. It...
I don't know how or why you did or what you did,
but I'll never be able to thank you enough.
it wasn't me.
it was your husband.
I don't understand.
it's ok. I'll explain later.
I didn't realize how insignificant Alise felt after the divorce,
so I guess I was just too busy trying to get through another day.
OK, mom, enough sharing.
I think I need a minute alone. - Sure.
that was him, wasn't it?
he did all those things in the car?
Yes.
and he's here with us right now.
he can hear you.
he told me about the day that you filled that.
he said you, you thought it was magic.
because we did it together.
and then he left.
he fought for me today, but why didn't he fight for me back then?
why did he just leave?
tell her... tell her I'm sorry.
I did fight. I just... it was too little, too late.
he's sorry.
he never wanted to stop being a part of your life.
is that true? - Yes.
Oh... tell her, tell her what I did.
he was your friend.
in the game. He was Phoenix.
he created that avatar just so he could be with you.
my dad? It's computers.
he can hardly work a cell phone.
well, he figured out now, just to be with you.
wish I could stay now.
I love you, too, daddy.
he sees the light.
and now that he knows you're safe, he can go.
thank you.
tell him good-bye.
it's ok.
she's gonna be fine.
Sam offered me a job. - And?
I said I was happy shrinking heads and sending disembodied voices into the light.
come on.
you know, you've got to stop telling everybody that you can hear ghosts.
Why? No one believes me.
people are gonna start thinking you're nuts.
trust me, I've been there.
people think I'm nuts already.
give me 360.
clear? - Clear.
he's alive.
who is he?
his name's Eli James.
he is a psychology professor with a therapy practice at the university.
so I take it you haven't seen any more ghosts?
safe assumption. - That's a lie!
you can't see them, but you can hear them.
so the good news is, I am not dead.
the bad news is I am going to spend the rest of my life listening to people who are and helping them.
please help me.
I need you to help me.
why wouldn't you just listen?
I know you can hear...
the ghost chatter is somewhat down. Doesn't sound like the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in my head any more
but there is this one little bugger who speaks up every night by humming.
sounds like you have a new since ghost, they pass to you, because they are scared and no one's listening.
usually you try to help them as they can or learn to tune them out and our time is up for today.
wow, what?
now I know how my psych patients feel?
I have someone coming to perform CPR on my computer and by the way, antique store
my tech can fix anything.
Oh, and he's even early.
only because all his friends are hanging out at the arcade leader.
Oh, it's working.
you're my hero.
if I lost the inventory, your mom would quit.
the files are all there, and I just have to defrag your hard drives.
please watch your language, we have company.
Ned, Eli. Eli, Ned.
cool. You are the guy who hears the ghosts.
you're Delia's kid, the one who hears about the ghosts.
it's wild you all of a sudden get the gifts.
Yeah. Well, don't get too excited. There was a catch.
I had to die first.
but good job on the Alt world-2.
is this version high for now?
Yeah, sort of kinks...
but if you overclock your rig, it kicks
your kid's amazing...
wait, this is not the archive you are
me and my friends, yeah.
I am online right now.
that's my avatar.
avatar?
what is that? Some sort of ancient weapon?
no, it's me, or what I look like in the game, an animated version.
it could look like... - The actual game or be a complete fantasy.
you can pick hair, skin colour, clothes, and you can be anyone do anything.
Yeah, that's why I keep a closed eye.
see, there you are.
you just went virtual.
Yeah, but I'll never wear my hair like that.
your avatar does.
so instead of going to an actual place to play games
Ooh, could you make me taller?
there are games in here.
mostly it's a place where kids go to hang out in world.
and it's educational.
I mean, you can meet people from around the world.
Ned, show her.
Oh, here come the campus crusaders,
or...
are they girl scouts?
the fringe girls. They're from the Halliwell Academy, private school. In real life, they wear uniforms.
it's like through the looking glass.
nothing is ever what it seems.
what about the guy who's standing next to him?
I mean, why is he giving Ned's avatar the evil eye?
that's Phoenix. He's always here, always with that same geek look.
Yeah, but, I mean, you guys see the way that he's looking at Ned.
not really.
he looks the same to me.
well, how about now?
I mean, he's looking right at me.
Oh, come on!
what?
what's happening? He's not moving.
his gamer must have left his machine.
didn't log off.
who are you?
who are you?! Where am I?!
who is that? What's happening?
OK, just--just try to calm down.
where is she?!
that can't be good. -That was a ghost, right?
who--who are you looking for?
I don't have control!
OK, that wasn't an avatar I just heard by any chance, was it?
Yes, Phoenix, or a ghost that looked just like him.
I swear it was nothing I did.
no, it was something I did.
I just drew a ghost out of my machine.
did that ghost just trash your store because he was angry about something?
I once had a patient in therapy who compulsively smashed animal figurines.
no, he was more confused than anything.
he said he wasn't in control.
like the real world's a new kind of game to him?
Oh, that's so trippy.
is any of this even possible?
I've seen ghosts interact with electronics before, but nothing like this.
what would make a ghost decide to go into a game?
why would he come out looking like his avatar?
sometimes spirits appear as they remember themselves, so if he died playing the game, maybe he thinks he's his own avatar.
didn't I hear him say, "where is she?
means he was looking for someone.
Phoenix hangs out mostly with one of the fringe girls.
OK, where do they hang?
I'll show you. Come on.
bookstore cafe.
free internet and half-decent coffee.
he's here.
tell me about the girl he likes.
I don't know her name, but her avatar's name is Sedona.
looks like he just found her.
Hi, honey.
wait, point me in his direction.
I'm dying to ask him some questions.
he's gone，and so is Sedona.
sorry, I couldn't sleep.
I kept thinking about this ghost.
Oh, Phoenix, the avatar ghost.
Ned says he was always online,
so I'm going with the theory that he died while playing.
death by gaming O. D. Wow.
although, you know, it's very possible in college,
I may have collapsed after 10 straight hours of playing asteroids.
you sure that wasn't the kegger?
I did a search for anyone who died while gaming, and suprisingly, there're a few.
I've narrowed it down to that guy, one in Korea and one in Oregon, Curtis Green.
wait, died after 5 straight days of gaming. Huh.
what, he didn't eat, he didn't sleep, he didn't drink?
Nope, he died of dehydration.
wait, shouldn't the internet gaming people be able to tell you who Phoenix really was?
Yeah, maybe, except the only thing I could access was his avatar bio.
FYI, he's into fast cars and coldplay.
coldplay. Could be any teenager anywhere, huh?
exactly, it's the world wide web for god sakes.
he could be a 10-year-old in Siberia.
wait, what about the girl from the bookstore?
she hung out with Phoenix online.
maybe she knows something about him.
that's what I'm hoping.
that looks like the girl that Phoenix was haunting yesterday.
I'm betting that's Sedona.
and those are her laced-up pals with the tatted up avatars. Got it.
so assuming this guy died from gaming,
here's what Mel's come up with.
these are from all around the world.
would the ghost have an accent?
this one didn't.
so, uh...
go make nice. See what she knows about Phoenix and this Curtis kid from Oregon.
she doesn't look much like a chit-chatter.
then use some other language.
Oh, well, that was a relatively painless inventory, besides the little computer glitch, or should I say computer ghost.
only apparently he's an out here ghost now because his avatar has not budged since yesterday.
is that what you've been watching all day and all night. I'm obsessed.
I mean, I have no idea how to work my own avatar,
but I can't stop watching his.
I mean, I drew a spirit out of a computer game. How freaky is that?
Yeah, half the time I'm online,
I am sure that there's a ghost in there.
you know, speaking metaphorically.
Yeah, well, this one might actually be. And if he is, he's a ghost that communicates with the living, which is why I'd like to figure out what his story is.
Yeah, it sounds like maybe this guy is into cosplay,
you know, people who dress up like their avatars.
no, I don't know, and how do you?
well, when you have a teenager, it's kind of dangerous not to know.
Hey, I bet you did't know that it only takes an I. M. Chat for someone to access your webcam.
Yeah, but Ned is smarter than that.
Yeah, I know, I know. It's just...
everybody else I'm worried about.
ha, take that, sucka!
Hey, give a newbie a break.
it's not right.
you have mad skills and a fast machine.
my dad guilt-gifted it to me after he moved out.
sorry.
Thanks, but I'm over it.
so, uh, you're redstar?
Ned. Yeah, I've seen you in there, too.
I'm Alise.
Yeah, so you hang out with that Phoenix guy, right?
what's up with him? - Oh, don't know.
probably stopped playing and forgot to log off.
do you know the guy, the gamer?
I only know him online.
ever think something might have happened? Like I heard about that guy in Oregon who died gaming.
what, you think it could be Phoenix?
that would be so sad. I really like him.
stay away from her!
the guy who keeled, Curtis Green, died like 3 weeks ago.
well, then it's not him for sure.
Phoenix just froze up yesterday.
I was hanging in world with him when it happened.
I said, leave her alone!
you, over here! Talk to me.
do you know him?
what's your game with her?
what's your game?
no, I've never seen him before.
you think you're her boyfriend?
she doesn't even have a clue who you even are.
this isn't real.
you're in a game, it's all fantasy.
she knows I'm real. That's why she talks to me.
you're real in a sense, Yes. But that is not the issue.
the issue is, who am I talking to?!
I'm Phoenix, ok?
that's all you need to know. Now leave us alone!
it's the classic case of grandiose delusional disorder.
he believes he's her boyfriend,
and she's the perfect target...
sweet, shy, troubled,
and she lives online.
and how do you usually treat something like this?
change their frame of reference.
jar them out of their fiction.
like tell him who he actually is?
that's a good start, If we knew who he really is.
well, could we track his I. P. address through the game?
Hey, they did it on CSI!
I think there'd have to be a criminal investigation.
or we could just talk to someone where he lives, in here.
talk to someone where he lives, in here.
he's gone!
Phoenix isn't there anymore.
I've been watching since he first came out.
he's been frozen. He was right there!
he was in there.
what happened? Your avatar started to move.
because I was in there, too. I had a vision.
only, it was different.
it was like I was a part of that world, you know?
I think I was seeing the game the way that he does.
OK, I don't like the idea of that guy in your head.
me either.
but if we want to find out who Phoenix is, or why he's haunting Alise.
it might be the only way.
Hey, I'm looking for Phoenix.
he was just here.
are you friends with him?
who wants to know?
you don't belong here.
you don't belong here, either.
just tell me who you are.
No! You're ruining everything!
this wasn't real when you were alive,
and it's not real now.
there has to be somebody in your real life that you want to talk to.
I can help you!
all right, that's enough!
I don't think so.
if you see a light, pal, go for it.
no way!
Melinda!
OK, that's enough fun.
it was...everything in there, it was real for my ghost.
you were kickin' some ass.
I was, right?
looked like he landed a few good hits, too.
looked like he was kind of hurting you.
no. I mean, I felt it in the game, but not now.
Hey, his avatar's gone again.
that's ok. He'll be back.
it's the only way he can talk to Alise.
that's not the only way he can be with her.
he's a ghost.
how can we find a guy who doesn't want to be found?
we get lucky.
looks like Phoenix sent you an email.
I don't understand. Now he wants me to find him?
he's a gamer. Maybe he likes to play games.
OK. Then let's play.
no good.
guess it would be, seeing how the guy is dead.
some kind of business address.
Ingram, Nash, Reynolds, Coben and company.
that's an ad firm in Hamilton.
so our dead guy's this Berrit dude?
OK, you go see if Phoenix ever sent Alise any emails from this address.
we'll see if we can find our ghost.
Berrit, incr-c. com? Never heard of him.
is he one of those guys who died gaming?
no, he's just someone I met in-world.
you spend too much time online.
I wish I could spend that much time online.
my mom thinks the Internet is evil.
did you want something?
Oh, no, thanks.
mine's the opposite. - Oh, your mom?
with the web, she's cool.
but she doesn't trust me to blow my nose out here in the real world.
well, it would be worse if your parents didn't care, right?
Yeah, I've got one of them, too.
anyway, at least I have my online friends I can gripe to.
OK, but how do you know they're your friends?
you don't really know who they are.
I don't really know you.
true that.
I think you get to know who people really are more online.
barriers come down.
I guess, but...
what about when it goes offline, and it's not what you thought?
have you ever had a thing go offline?
I've emailed, talked on cell, sure.
you felt safe doing that?
safe as anything in real life turned out to be.
you mean, like your family?
thought we'd always be together.
then one day I come home, and it's gone.
no more.
at least with this, I can always count on it being there.
Mr. Berrit...
no, sorry, he's not with the firm.
well, I know he wouldn't be anymore, but did he ever work here?
wait, do you mean Errit, Mr. Bill Errit?
he's in now.
isn't he supposed to be dead?
Curioser and curioser.
Oh, god, not again.
I thought I was through with this.
with what?
about 2 weeks ago, the FBI shows up here.
accuses me of cyber-stalking, luring underage girls and transmitting pornography.
so you didn't send the email?
of course not. Someone stole my address.
and the guy who did's a real winner, judging from the stuff they thought I did.
what kind of stuff?
he deals in candid, suggestive photos of beautiful young women. Of teenagers, mostly.
God knows how he gets them to do it.
cops said some of them even end in webcam shots of themselves.
so the guy who sent me the email, he's a predator?
and a good one.
they've traced stolen emails to him all across the country,
but he's always gone by the time they get there.
that's the agent handling the case.
if this pervert's after you now, I'd call him.
can't be too sad when a perv bites it.
Yeah, except it doesn't change anything.
I mean, the ghost controls a computer.
it can get young girls to do things, like maybe even turn on a webcam.
well, I know a cop.
I used to help her profile some cases.
let me call her.
look, whoever created Phoenix is a cyber-perv.
he gets pics of teens and puts them on the web!
OK, but if the FBI is handling this case,
why are you talking to me?
because I don't know them. I know you.
and you owe me, remember?
what?
Oh, um, the I. D. thief I helped you profile?
fine. I will try to subpoena the game for an email ID.
but don't get your hopes up.
these guys switch servers all the time.
internet cafes, motels,
your random, roaming Wi-Fi.
so even if we get an address, I doubt the guy will still be there.
unless he's dead.
Yeah, I'm gonna be a little late.
it turns out this ghost is a total creep, so...
uh, you know what?
I'm gonna have to call you back.
I want you to stay the hell away from Alise.
No! I told you
save it. I know who you are.
I know what you've done to those girls,
I know that you've tried to ruin their lives,
and you're doing the same thing to Alise.
I would never... - Yeah, but you did!
again and again.
I mean, you had to have known better,
but you didn't stop, not even after you died.
you're still stalking Alise.
you're confused.
you don't know who I am.
I just want to protect her.
did you have a good day?
Yeah!
get your travel shoes on.
I know where the real Phoenix lives.
let's go.
of course he said he was protecting Alise.
he might even believe it.
the guy's a sicko.
is that a technical term?
Oh, I'm sorry. Twisted sicko.
I don't know, it felt sincere.
welcome to his world of deception.
these guys find out people's weaknesses, and they prey on it.
what's my weakness?
trusting sickos.
Oh, come on...
come on.
we're just going to help ourselves?
not so sure this is such a good idea.
I'm thinking it may be time - to call in a higher power... - Shh.
like maybe... the cops.
OK, from the smell,
I'm guessing that guy is not asleep.
that's the real Phoenix.
did I call it?
it's a twisted sicko.
something's not right.
Oh, my god.
he was telling the truth.
he really did just want to protect Alise.
I mean, all of these photos are her.
he's not a predator.
he's Larry Jones, Alise's dad.
you think he's been dead for what?
Yeah, it was an apparenent heart attack.
they think he's been dead 3 days.
so that's when the ghost must have gone into the computer.
so he's protecting his daughter, but from what?
and why was he even in the computer? That's just...
I don't know, but he does.
it's the only way I could be a part of her life.
I had a stupid affair.
my wife was bitter, and it rubbed off on Alise.
my daughter made it clear she didn't want to have anything to do with me,
and I didn't blame her for hating me, but...
God, I missed her.
that's when you came up with Phoenix.
well, in there, I felt connected to her.
then what happened?
well, after I died, I found myself back at home with Alise, and I saw that she was emailing someone.
someone in the game?
Yeah, she met him in there.
I mean, I was Phoenix, and Phoenix was her friend,
but this guy was... more.
I mean, the emails were pretty intimate.
so you suspected he was a predator?
or a lusty teenager. I didn't know.
I mean, I didn't know if I was being an overprotective dad.
like when you threw me across the street in the game.
look, I just didn't want you to blow my cover with this creep.
but then when I realized that you were actually trying to help,
that's when I forwarded you on the emails that this guy sent Alise.
the ones we traced.
so the guy who sent the emails,
he was the same guy that the cops wanted for teen porn?
and when you found that out,
I went back in the game and I tried to warn her, but she s convinced that he was just a...
happy teen, just like she was, and she would not listen to me.
it wasn't always like that.
I mean, we used to do things.
we used to laugh.
I know.
I saw your pictures.
the one in the jeep?
Yeah.
we took that in Sedona.
she said that we were the Indiana Joneses.
we ran up this hill looking for treasure, and we came down with this leather pouch full of...
I mean, I don't know what.
rocks and feathers and dirt and...
she said it was magic.
and that it would protect us forever.
look, you have to warn her.
you have to tell her to be careful.
please.
don't worry.
come on.
excuse me...
Alise, hi. I'm Melinda Gordon.
I knew your dad, and I'm so sorry.
what's this about?
I think your daughter might be in danger.
well, the police didn't say anything about that.
that's because they don't know about it.
the predator's reached out to Alise online.
he collects pictures of young girls.
who are you?
I know this is a bad time.
I asked you a question.
look, I...
we, um, talk to spirits,
and Alise's dad contacted me, so...
OK, that's enough.
my daughter just lost her dad,
so whatever your story is, tell it to the police.
follow them! Tell them!
what do you want me to say?
that her dad is a ghost avatar?
it'll never work.
there's only one thing that will.
what?
we find this guy and we stop him.
are we ready yet?
you're set. All you need to do is get him to email you, then Eli's friend can track the I. P.
and wherever that is, Sam said the FBI can send someone there fast.
whoa, that's me?
you said you want to lure him, didn't you?
there's Alise's avatar,
and that's Cal.
that's who I'm looking for?
I think so. The avatar Alise is talking to, he's the guy you saw in the game the other day.
same guy.
are you ready? You're my only way in.
OK.
let's catch a predator.
Melinda, Melinda!
It's...a...private chatroom!
you can't get in!
all right, I get it, minus an eardrum.
well, what are you waiting for?
give him your email, for god sakes.
be brazen. There's no dating protocol there.
how do we even know he heard me?
we wait.
Hey, dude.
second hey, man, let's get out of here.
thanks for picking us up.
Cal. Hey. Where are you?
I didn't see you in there.
I'm outside.
Oh, snap. I was inside looking for you, but my friends made me bail.
I was wearing a red shirt.
geek, you didn't see me? You know what I look like.
I sent you that picture.
no. But a bunch of us are going to the dance pad contest later at Brookside Mall.
how does that sound?
well, I don't know, I don't have a car.
I do. I'll pick you up.
you're the Jones that lives on Latimer Road, right?
wow, you do your homework.
what can I say? I like you.
so I'll be there at 6: 00.
is he still there?
no, he left.
maybe he's at the virtual cafe.
no, he's not.
Cal and Alise have both logged off,
so what do we do now?
we wait for him to email Melinda's avatar back.
no, I can't wait!
look, he wants pictures.
all it takes is one weak moment, and she's very vulnerable right now.
which is why you have to keep an eye on her.
OK, let us know if he contacts her again.
get a cell phone number, email address, anything.
OK, ok, ok.
go watch your girl.
we're gonna get this guy, we are.
are we?
it's looking more promising.
check this out, just came in.
obviously he read my cry for help.
got his service provider.
Eli's cop friend just needs to track his I. P.
hopefully before he moves again.
detective Sam Blair, please.
I can't believe he's in Grandview.
Yeah, where's the FBI, the camera, the balloons?
we're about to catch a predator in our hometown.
look, after that last false alarm,
you're lucky I'm even here.
he's a regular. About a day every month.
brings his laptop, says he likes quiet.
sounds like a cyber criminal or a cheating spouse.
would you mind opening it, please?
OK, maybe you were right.
or maybe you were.
looks like we found his private stash.
he's here for Alise.
all right, I'm going to need address, phone numbers, and nobody touch anything else in here.
Hey, Cal, what's up? Where are you?
home. My brother's not back with my mom's car.
bummer.
I know. This thing's starting in 20.
we're all headin' over.
OK, well, have fun.
no, freak, I'm tryin' to tell you,
my brother's near your house.
he'll probably drive by on his way home.
well, I don't know.
Oh, right.
you probably need to ask your mom first.
no, it's not that. It's just...
sorry, my friends are here.
I can't hear.
whatever you decide's ok.
we got in touch with the mom.
Alise was supposed to be home, but she hasn't been answering her cell.
has anyone checked the house?
a patrol car's driving by now.
they're in a blue minivan.
I am never going to get used to that.
what?
that I forgot to tell you that the predator's driving a blue minivan.
license plate number GRK998.
license plate number GRK998.
OK. Not sure how you forgot that, but I'll tell them.
look, you don't understand, he's there now.
he's picking her up, now, now!
OK, just... please go and tell Sam that he's already there.
don't worry, all right?
the police are on their way.
you must be Alise. I'm Cal's brother.
hop in. We'll pick up the others on the way.
what's wrong? - Well, it's just,
I just... I don't know.
Ah, I get it.
you're not sure you should go anywhere with the big bad brother.
no, it's not that.
it's just... well, I don't know you.
it's cool. Cal told me how your mom has you on a short leash.
I get it. I'm older, practically an only kid.
you just want to say,"hey, I have a brain,
you just want to say,"hey, I have a brain, I can think for myself.
Yeah, that's for sure.
look, maybe when your mom gets home, she can drive you over.
Yeah. Yeah, she's...whatever.
anyway, I, uh, I gotta get going.
So...you comin'?
Yeah. Um, just wait one sec.
all set?
get out!
get out of the car!
ready.
get out! Alise, No. No!
No! Alise!
they just left, you can catch them.
I've been calling her on her cell. She's not picking up.
no, no, no, they're not in there!
they're in a van, a blue van!
Argh, this is not happening!
Sam said there's no word yet.
she's in the car.
I don't know what to do, I'm completely helpless!
I just don't know how to protect her.
OK, where are they? Where were they heading?
they started toward Brookside, and they turned off the highway.
I'll tell Sam.
there's still something you can do.
no, no, she got in the car!
I couldn't stop her!
Yeah, but you can stop him.
Hello, I tried!
I'm a ghost, people walk through me!
I know that, but you're the only one who can help Alise right now.
look, you love your little girl.
OK, now believe that you can do this.
you have the power to stop him.
this isn't Brookside.
I think you should let me out here.
huh? What are you...
look, no one made you get in this car.
you wanted to.
relax, it's only pictures.
I didn't know.
Oh, come on! You knew.
let's not pretend. You knew.
daddy's dead.
he can't help you anymore.
hazard, hazard. Stop the car.
stop the car.
at the end of the road
what is going on?
did you touch something? - I don't
turn left now.
Oh! What the
come here.
get away!
no way in hell!
you gotta be kidding me.
Freeze! Don't move!
all right, ok!
on the ground, on the ground now!
OK!
let me see your hands!
it's ok, sweet heart.
thank god you're ok.
Thanks.
so the FBI's been tracking this guy for over a year.
how'd you get all this information?
I do what any good shrink does
I talk to ghosts.
I do, really.
no, one showed up last night. It...
I don't know how or why you did or what you did,
but I'll never be able to thank you enough.
it wasn't me.
it was your husband.
I don't understand.
it's ok. I'll explain later.
I didn't realize how insignificant Alise felt after the divorce,
so I guess I was just too busy trying to get through another day.
OK, mom, enough sharing.
I think I need a minute alone. - Sure.
that was him, wasn't it?
he did all those things in the car?
Yes.
and he's here with us right now.
he can hear you.
he told me about the day that you filled that.
he said you, you thought it was magic.
because we did it together.
and then he left.
he fought for me today, but why didn't he fight for me back then?
why did he just leave?
tell her... tell her I'm sorry.
I did fight. I just... it was too little, too late.
he's sorry.
he never wanted to stop being a part of your life.
is that true? - Yes.
Oh... tell her, tell her what I did.
he was your friend.
in the game. He was Phoenix.
he created that avatar just so he could be with you.
my dad? It's computers.
he can hardly work a cell phone.
well, he figured out now, just to be with you.
wish I could stay now.
I love you, too, daddy.
he sees the light.
and now that he knows you're safe, he can go.
thank you.
tell him good-bye.
it's ok.
she's gonna be fine.
Sam offered me a job. - And?
I said I was happy shrinking heads and sending disembodied voices into the light.
come on.
you know, you've got to stop telling everybody that you can hear ghosts.
Why? No one believes me.
people are gonna start thinking you're nuts.
trust me, I've been there.
people think I'm nuts already.
Forty-Love!
this is match point. You ready?
finally. Let's get it over with.
ace!
I hope you're not going easy on me 'Cause I'm new around here.
easy? What, that was brutal!
my sweat has sweat.
what, are you some kind of tennis hustler or something?
figure new town, new school, new unexpecting kids to beat?
Hey, I didn't take your money or anything.
no, just my self respect.
look out!
Diana, I told you, follow through.
it's all about the follow through. Come on.
any day now.
you're welcome.
what was that all about?
you know Diana Morrison?
I used to, back when I lived in Grandview the first time.
we were friends. - Diana?
it was like a million years ago. - Diana?!
Diana, Diana! Somebody help!
Diana! - Diana, please! Diana!
what's happened?
Diana, Diana! Please wake up!
she just dropped out of nowhere, she won't respond!
I'm calling 9-1-1.
I'll stay here. Go get help.
OK. - Diana, it's Olivia.
Diana, please wake up!
Diana! Diana! Wake up!
Yes, we need an ambulance.
Grandview Park at the tennis courts. A girl's collapsed.
why won't you wake up? What's wrong with you?
Diana... Diana!
thank you. - Sure.
thank you, nurse.
Jim. - Hi, doctor.
Melinda, how you feeling? - I feel ok.
no more nausea, light-headedness?
um, no.
well...
you're not pregnant.
Yeah, we... we figured as much.
Yeah, that's what the pregnancy test said, too.
all ten of them.
so then...
everything that I was feeling...
it was all just in my head?
no, you did conceive, but your body didn't support the pregnancy.
doc, what does that mean?
if you're worrying about your chances of having a baby, don't.
there's plenty of treatable conditions that can account for this.
let me run some tests, and we'll go from there, ok?
OK.
the nurse will schedule your next appointment.
Thanks.
I never really figured it would be this hard.
it's gonna be ok.
we're gonna make this happen, together.
you need to finish your shift.
go, I'll be ok.
you sure?
Yeah.
cause you can hold onto my hand as long as you want.
Oh! Sorry.
I love you. I'll see you later.
doc, bp 75 over 42. Coming in!
pulse is rapid and irregular.
I want an ECG and a chest X-Ray.
and get me a consent to treat.
do we have her name?
Diana Morrison.
Dorothy?
Ned, what are you doing here?
are you ok?
Yeah, I'm fine. We're both fine.
one, two...
girl collapsed on the tennis courts.
Olivia and I wanted to make sure she was ok.
she has to be ok. - Olivia!
mom!
I went to the courts to pick you up but you weren't there, and they said a girl had collapsed! I thought that...
I'm fine, mom. I'm sorry for scaring you.
I should have called.
it's Diana.
Diana Morrison?
Where's Diana Morrison?
I'm her mother. They told me she was here.
Olivia?
what are you doing here?
Mrs. Morrison, I was at the courts with Ned.
Diana was there, too.
she was taking a lesson, I guess.
she just collapsed.
was it heat stroke?
she must have just fainted.
she barely ate any breakfast.
No!
No!
time of death...
what do you mean, time of death?!
you all right?
did you know this girl?
no, no, I'm fine.
um, time of death, 3: 49.
what just happened?!
do you know me?
wait!
answer me!
what just happened?!
are you the doctor?
when can I see her?
your daughter suffered a blood clot in her lung.
I'm very sorry. We did everything we could, but we weren't able to revive your daughter, - and she died. - No, no!
not Diana!
No! Not my little girl!
No! She can't...
is there anyone we can call?
a spouse, another family member?
no, it's just me and Diana.
I'm sorry.
no...
no, let's go.
mom, she doesn't have anyone!
we're probably just making it worse.
come on, we don't belong here.
is Diana here?
Yeah.
she's with her mom.
I think she wanted to say goodbye before moving on.
or maybe not.
it's crazy.
it just makes no sense. - I know.
is Eli talking to the kids?
Yeah, Ned says he's helping a lot.
and thank you so much for suggesting him for that.
he's a good therapist. He really listens.
well, when you told me how important Diana and her mom were to everyone...
Ooh, let me give you a hand.
Yeah, all the kids in the neighborhood used to go over there and play.
they just had one of those homes, you know, very warm and inviting. Everyone loved them.
except for Olivia's mom, from what I saw.
I just don't get that.
well, it seemed mutual.
you know, maybe it's just because
Cynthia was worried about her daughter.
no, it seemed like something more than that.
I mean, Ned said that the daughter was chilly with Olivia at the court.
she might have just been feeling sick, you know?
Yeah, maybe, but it didn't end there.
Meaning?
what? Was there a ghost?
did you see Diana?
are you sure you want to know that?
anything's better than thinking a spirit that young would just vanish!
she didn't vanish. I saw her at the hospital.
well, did she say anything?
I mean, did she go into the light or whatever?
impressive! No, she went in a different direction.
she followed Olivia and her mom home.
well, what does that mean?
Mmm, my experience?
nothing good.
what can I say?
mom, dad, are you back?
Hello?
is someone here?
Hello?!
is someone here?
Hello? - Mr. Or Mrs. Keller, please.
no, they're not in right now.
can I take a message?
I can't hear you! Who's calling?
what's happening?!
if there's anything we could do, Mrs. Morrison...
just don't be strangers.
my home will always be open to you kids.
techno spook by the computer.
scary.
where did you hear that?
Olivia was telling some of her girlfriends this morning at assembly.
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Morrison.
is that Olivia with Diana's mom?
Yeah.
well, that didn't seem to go very well.
let's go see what's going on.
Olivia?
my name is Eli James.
I'm a therapist over at Rockland U.
I was asked to come here today to speak to your fellow schoolmates about your loss.
Yeah, I've seen you around.
Ned said, uh, you two were there when it happened?
Yeah, whatever it was.
does anyone know how she got sick like that?
I haven't heard anything yet.
when's that picture from?
it's you and Diana, right?
Yeah, we were, like, 7 or 8.
see that cast on her leg?
she just had her ankle surgery,
and I signed her cast right there, "OK."
my ironic initials.
you said you and Diana used to be friends?
Yeah, the first time I lived in Grandview.
it's ancient history.
Olivia, I do this a lot, and I promise you, if you're feeling bad about something, talking about it always makes it better.
when we were little, our moms were such good friends that we did everything together.
it was almost like we were sisters.
with play dates and sports and camping.
we even have the same birthday, so our parties were like this whole big deal every year.
and what happened?
it just ended.
I remember one night I woke up, and my mom was in bed with me, and she was rocking me, just crying and crying.
I asked her what was wrong, but all she would say was that she loved me.
and then after that, everything changed.
Diana's mom and dad split up,
we stopped hanging out with them,
and then we got transferred to Texas.
or my dad, so we left.
did you and Diana keep in touch?
we tried, or at least I did.
I wrote her and stuff, but she never wrote me back.
I guess Diana made new friends.
my mom said that I should, too.
she told me to forget about her.
it was really weird.
it was like she was mad at her, too.
well, what happened when your dad got transferred back?
she didn't write me in 8 years.
I mean, why would she want to be my friend now?
she didn't need me when she had all of this.
what's dad doing here?
excuse me, I better go.
what's that all about?
if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck...
get your mind out of the gutter.
she pulled him aside, she hugged him, she whispered sweet nothings...
it was a prayer vigil. Who didn't she hug?
forget my masters in clinical psych for a minute, which I'd like to forget 'cause I'm still paying off the loans,
and let's just look at the circumstantial evidence.
what evidence?
two women who used to be best friends suddenly become enemies, and don't give their kids a reason.
Yeah, but that still doesn't explain the ghost's weird behavior at the hospital, or following the wrong family home.
maybe Diana knew about the affair before she died.
maybe that's why she was so nasty to Olivia at the tennis courts, and then went to her house to haunt her.
unless...
unless?
Diana found something out at the hospital that proved more than the affair.
what if she found out something that proved everything?
I'm gonna have to buy a vowel.
OK, what if Olivia's dad was her dad, too, and she found that out in the hospital records?
well, that would explain why he was at the vigil.
I mean, if he lost a daughter, too...
Yeah, and why Diana went home with the Kellers instead of her own mom.
Olivia could be the half-sister - She never knew she had. - Or wanted.
making Olivia's dad...
the man who ruined everything.
Hey, kiddo.
Oh, god, you startled me.
what are you doing up?
I can't sleep again.
thinking about Diana?
um, mom won't even talk to me about her.
I know that we weren't friends at the end, but she died.
what happened, dad?
I mean, with mom and Mrs. M.
how can mom be so cold to her, especially now?
if you know, please tell me.
honey, I just think that...
I don't know, maybe there's a little guilt, 'cause...
we still have you.
did you hear that?
it's the same noise that I heard the other night.
it's coming from upstairs. It's the attic.
wait here, ok?
no way.
dad, I'm scared.
don't worry, honey. It's probably just rats in the rat traps.
those are no rats.
that's strange.
dad! - Honey, are you ok?
Yeah!
it's Diana, I know it is.
my dad claims that there's some sort of reasonable explanation, although he sure isn't coming up with one.
so what is he saying?
not to tell my mother.
he says that he doesn't want to worry her.
but he went to work, and my mom's out, and I'm so scared. She keeps doing it!
I put them away so many times, and she keeps bringing them back out.
Diana did this.
you believe me?
Yes.
we both do.
Why?
because I can see spirits.
I've seen Diana's.
I watched her follow you home from the hospital.
that's why Ned wanted you to meet with me.
do the photos always look like this?
Yeah, each time I found them the same way.
starting with photos of my mom and dad growing up, their wedding and all of my baby photos up through now.
it's like the whole family history laid out in photos.
and then there's the phone calls.
phone calls? - Yeah, it rings,
I answer, and I can hear someone trying to say something.
does it sound like Diana's voice?
no, it sounded like a woman, but it's totally garbled.
and then it's cut off by this awful screeching sound.
um, where's your telephone?
it's in the kitchen.
please tell me you have caller I. D.
OK, so you said that the last interrupted call came in...
about an hour ago.
got it.
No! It's happening again.
it's ok. We're here.
she's gone.
why does Diana care about me and my family?
I don't know.
but I think I know someone who does.
Hi. I'm looking for a nurse, but I don't know her name.
she was working the E. R. when that high school kid died, Diana Morrison.
is there anything I can help you with?
well, it was just a tough day, and so I wanted to thank her for reaching out to the family.
her name is Perry, Dorothy Perry.
I'm sure she'd appreciate it, if she were here.
I know she was trying to make some copies, and a phone call, and...
nothing was working for her.
is there a copier nearby?
um, the records room on the third floor.
great. Thank you.
Hello? Someone here?
anybody there?
wait, nurse Perry!
nurse Perry!
I just want to talk!
Oh, my god! Please, somebody, help me!
help!
the word is, she's going to be out for a while.
they've got her on heavy painkillers and anti-anxiety meds.
did you get anything else?
Oh, yeah. She got worked over pretty good.
head laceration, 2 broken ribs, hairline fracture of her collarbone.
Diana was so angry at her.
Yeah, Mel, how was an E. R. nurse involved in this?
I think she was on the phone with Olivia's family trying to tell them something.
when I saw her, she was coming out of the record room.
Melinda, come on, it's one thing to go asking around about a medical condition, it's another to...
Yeah, but we still don't know what caused Diana's death!
I don't think the answer is in those records. Those are old records.
maybe it was something else.
maybe something in Diana's past that the doctor should have seen.
maybe they made a mistake.
I mean, she was a healthy 16-year-old girl.
OK, then if that's the case, why is the ghost haunting Olivia and her family?
I don't know.
the girl is dead, a woman is hurt, and I am out of theories.
please.
all I need is 10 minutes.
moore, Moriarty. Where's Morrison?
missing. Hold on a second.
these must be waiting to be re-filed.
there you go.
her medical records.
these are from like 8 years ago.
Oh, looks like she had an operation.
fractured her ankle.
and Diana's birth record.
Mr. Keller's not listed as her father.
why would a nurse want copies of this stuff?
wait a minute, this is weird. Look at this.
her blood type on her surgery record doesn't match her blood type on her birth record.
ab. O.
do hospitals make mistakes like that?
it's possible, but rare.
or maybe there's another possibility.
I saw the records she put together.
I know why you're angry, but I think she was trying to do the right thing.
she wanted the truth to come out.
there are some mistakes that you can't fix!
I found that out the day that I died.
answer me!
what just happened?!
I followed her to the records room.
and right away, I saw something weird.
what are you looking for?
and that's when I realized what happened.
Olivia and I were switched at birth.
the blood types didn't match, I know.
but that's not what was really upsetting her.
she looked so guilty!
what have I done?
like she had done something awful.
you were there the day I was born, too?
and that's when it hit me...
it was her mistake.
that's how she knew to look in those files.
it's her fault!
look, I know that you're upset, but I really
I think it was just a mistake, you know?
a stupid accident.
do you want to know what's stupid?
how could I not have known?!
I mean, we even have the same birthday!
and my so-called family?
my mom is blonde, blue-eyed, a semi-pro tennis player.
so I always told myself that I sucked at tennis because I took after my dad.
well, it turns out,
I do take after my mom,
I just had the wrong one.
look, I know that this is painful, but I can help you, talk to your mom, your birth family.
No! They can't know.
well, I think you need them to.
that's why you went to the Keller's house, right?
so that you could reconnect with the family you came from?
you need to make peace with this so that you can move on.
that woman's mistake has caused enough damage already.
well, you don't control that anymore.
I know that's upsetting, but...
take a look at that nurse and tell me what I can and I can't do.
I will do whatever I have to do.
no one can find out.
Hi, Ms. Perry.
um, my name is Melinda Gordon and I'd like to talk to you, if you're feeling up to it.
you're the one who came looking for me when I fell?
Yes.
I thought you might have some information on Diana Morrison, and now I couldn't be more certain that you do.
I know what happened the day that Diana was born.
I know that she was switched with Olivia Keller.
look, I know that you're scared.
a lot of really strange things are happening to you, but trust me...
they won't end until you admit what you did.
what I did?
No! I...
I was there when it happened, but I'm not the one who switched those girls.
OK, the day that Diana Morrison was born, there'd been this huge accident on the interstate.
we were understaffed and overwhelmed.
the bracelet must have come off in the bath.
the charge nurse seems confused.
um, is everything ok?
you were sent to room 214.
you got to get Mrs. Keller up and walking. Go, now!
I was fresh out of nursing school.
I was trying to learn without asking too many questions.
what could I do?
I didn't have any proof.
it was just a feeling.
but I did remember those girls' names.
then I saw the mothers bonding and talking in the hallways, and cradling their babies.
and then you saw them again 16 years later.
I recognized her name when the paramedics brought her in.
do we have her name?
Diana Morrison.
circumstances of her death, the blood clot,
it made me wonder all over again.
so I pulled the girl's medical records.
that's what confirmed it.
you know, I've been trying to contact the families ever since.
it's just that some...
something just... doesn't want to let...
what's happening to me?
look, it's gonna be ok.
you suspected for 16 years.
I need to know why you're so determined to tell them now.
because the blood clot that killed Diana was a genetic condition.
it could affect someone else in her biological family.
they have to be told.
that's a tough one, even for you.
I have to tell them, obviously.
I mean the Kellers need to know about the disease, and then Cynthia Morrison's going to find out.
I just don't know what's going to happen to the ghost or the families.
I can't even imagine.
I mean, mourning your child, only to find out she isn't yours.
and then the child that is yours, belongs to someone else.
Olivia's parents, too.
I mean, their birth child is dead.
they're never going to get to know her as theirs.
I guess that's why Diana's been fighting so hard to keep this all a secret.
it's all just to protect everyone from the big bombshell.
who do you tell first?
I think I have to start with the woman who raised her.
so kind of you to bring this by.
I think everyone misses Diana.
I know that Ned does.
Oh, he's a sweet boy.
is that how you know my daughter, through Ned?
what are you doing?
I warned you not to do this!
actually, I didn't know Diana when she was alive.
but I've talked to her recently.
I see earthbound spirits.
that's how I know that Diana's here.
I came here because she's not at peace, and there's a reason why she can't move on.
I don't understand. Is this some kind of joke?
no, this is...
it's very real.
Diana's been trying to protect you from something, but I think it's something you should know, because it's going to come out eventually.
you have no right to do this!
who do you think you are?!
I spoke to a nurse at Mercy Hospital,
Dorothy Perry.
she was there the day that Diana died, and the day that she was born.
the same day that Olivia Keller was born.
stop it! Stop!
why is this suddenly coming out now?
who told you about all this?
you know what I'm talking about?
Mmm, I have a pretty good feeling.
What?!
how did you find out?
I saw a blood panel from the ankle surgery she had when she was 8.
is that when you realized the truth?
no, it was long before that.
I've known Diana wasn't mine almost as long as I've had her.
that's impossible.
you never said anything.
please.
I had a long labor, and so did Lisa Keller.
we met walking the halls, passing the time together, waiting for it to happen.
both having girls, excited.
and we just became friends.
there's so much joy.
and then what happened?
then I brought Diana home, and something felt off.
everybody thought it was post-partum depression, and at first, so did I.
I mean, I love my little girl.
but that feeling didn't go away.
so, when did you suspect that Diana wasn't your baby?
as they started to grow older,
I started to notice similarities between me and Olivia that I didn't notice with Diana.
when she played tennis, she played like me.
she had my mother's eyes.
and sometimes, when I looked at her and she smiled,
I felt like I was looking at a mirror.
what about when you looked at me?
did you contact Lisa Keller?
not until the pre-surgery blood work confirmed it.
that's when I called Lisa.
how did she react?
she didn't believe it.
refused to have Olivia tested.
she cut off all contact.
they moved to Texas.
she said it was for Kevin's job.
she was running away from the uncomfortable truth.
so my own mother didn't want me,
and you couldn't get rid of me?
let her explain. - She already has.
and if they loved the two of us so little, then they won't miss us when we're both gone!
what's going on?
is that Diana...
we need to go see Olivia before Diana does.
Diana, stop it!
why are you doing this?
what is it?
what do you want from me, Diana?
Mrs. Keller?
yes?
my name is Melinda Gordon.
is your daughter home?
what is this about?
trust her, Lisa. This is important.
Oh, my god! What happened?
who...
who did all of this? Livvy? Sweetie? Olivia
her backpack is not here.
or her cell phone, clothes, laptop.
Oh, my god!
what did you do?!
did you tell Olivia?
no.
then how did she know about these?
how did she know to even look for these?
Diana must have led her to them.
What?!
these are all letters from Diana to Olivia.
and she thought I never wrote her back.
her mom must have kept them from her.
you kept these from Olivia?
my god, Lisa.
are you so selfish that you wouldn't even let our daughters be friends?
Diana's baby bracelet.
I sent this to Lisa, trying one last time after I told her the truth.
and now Olivia knows the truth.
I have to find her, I have to call the police!
no, you don't. You know where she is, don't you?
please.
Olivia needs your help.
sweetheart!
Oh, I'm so glad we found you!
stay away from me.
I understand why you're angry, but, Olivia,
you have to know that...
what? What you knew for the last 8 years?
I found the letter.
dear Lisa, I wanted you to have something of your daughter, Diana.
Olivia...
don't talk to me, I can't hear any more lies!
Olivia, don't. Don't talk to your mother that way.
my mother? And who are you?
the woman who gave birth to me let me play in their house and then let me go?
and not just somebody else's house, but halfway across the country.
were you relieved when we moved?
did the two of you work all of that out together?
she tried.
when she found out the truth, she tried to talk to me, but, Olivia,
you were my daughter and so was Diana,
and I couldn't lose you both!
both, what do you mean?
well, from the time they could walk, they would follow you everywhere.
puppet shows, games, sports.
kids love you.
what if they had to choose?
they would both choose you.
Lisa, look at your daughter.
your daughter Olivia.
as much as it kills me to say that.
why do you think she's so angry?
it's not because you kept this from her.
she thinks this means that you don't love her,
and there's nothing more in the world that she wants than your love.
well, I always thought there was nothing more in the world I wanted than hers.
and then... you called me that day, and I wanted more.
whenever I looked at either one of them.
Olivia, you are my little girl.
nothing can change that.
but Diana, her hands, her eyes, the way she walked... She was mine, too.
I'm sorry that I tore our daughters apart.
I'm sorry that I abandoned both of you.
how could you not want both of them?
I know I did.
I don't want them to hurt anymore.
Diana wants to forgive you.
wait, Diana's here?
that's how we found you.
she told me that you guys used to play here together.
tell Olivia that I did make new friends, but...
there were none like her.
she wants you to know that she missed you.
there was no one like you.
I missed her, too.
I still do.
sweetheart, we're going to sit down, we're going to talk all of this through.
we'll figure out where to go from here...
together.
she's saying good-bye.
will she be ok?
she wants to know if you're going to be all right without her.
I'm not going to lie to you, sweet girl.
nothing is ever going to be the same.
remember what you used to tell me when I had a bad day or I didn't do well?
you would always say that the only thing that mattered to you is that you knew I tried my best.
that's what I need you to do.
I need you to try to be ok.
for me.
she wants you to try.
just like you used to tell her to do.
she needs you to promise that you'll at least try.
I will, sweet girl.
I'll try.
she's gone.
thank you.
long day?
the longest.
do you want to talk about it?
when I...saw those two mothers love daughters that weren't even really theirs,
it just made me realize...
if we can't do this...
if we can't have a baby, would...
would you consider adoption?
Absolutely.
I really...needed to hear you say that, because the tests and the trying...
but Mel, look at this.
are these my results?
well, I did run into Dr. Chen today.
well, what is this prescription?
it's for a hormone.
it helps the embryo attach itself.
it basically makes it feel more at home so it can settle and grow.
and this is all we need?
Yeah.
so we're going to be able to have a baby?
Yeah.
let's have a baby.
God, I love you.
you did conceive.
but your body didn't support the pregnancy.
you have to understand...
you move between the world of life and death.
sometimes you come back from one with a touch of the other.
a touch? - Of death.
be careful. It might brush off.
on what? - On what you touch.
well, what is this prescription?
it's for a hormone. it helps the embryo attach itself.
basically makes it feel more at home so it can...
and this is all we need? - Yeah.
so we're gonna be able to have a baby?
Really? I can't believe you worked on Wall Street.
neither can I. - Uh, I told you that.
no, you told me he hates suits.
I told you he hated being a suit.
a suit who is on his way to a corner office.
what can I say? - Well, I gotta tell you,
I'm glad I'm finally getting a chance to meet the legendary Jim Clancy.
he's heard a lot about you.
you can hear a lot about somebody when they've worked 80 hour weeks together.
so listen, Jim, you don't miss the anxiety and the tension of tearing open that journal the moment you wake up, huh?
uh, No.
what I'm looking forward to is seeing your wedding announcement in this sunday's times. It makes me very happy.
Oh, me, too. - Me, three.
times a thousand. A million squared. Huh?
mommy, how much longer?
just a few more things and we're off to the lake house.
and guess what?
Jim and Melinda are gonna stay with us all through the wedding.
wait until you guys see Natalie's dress.
Oh, she looks like a princess.
a ballerina.
a beautiful ballerina.
um, are you sure you're ok with everything?
place settings, furniture?
because furnishing events is kind of new to us, and we just want to get it right.
please, you guys. I love everything.
I'm not even worried about it.
well then, why don't you let us take care of the rest?
Yeah, go get some frozen yogurt with Nat , and when you get back, we'll be all packed up and ready to go, right?
Mm-hmm.
did I tell you about this guy?
Oh...thanks, honey. I love you.
love you, too.
Bye! - Bye.
Bye, Jim.
gone.
Oh, where is it? - It's right here!
Ah, it's got new satin lining and restitched embroidery.
it looks perfect. what do you think?
think she's gonna love this necklace?
she's gonna love it. - I want it.
can I have it?
see you guys in a couple?
all right. - Ok.
here, let me bring this out.
you got it? - Yep.
see you, guys.
all right. Ok, we'll see you guys.
Thanks, guys.
all right, your bag's in the car.
the car's packed.
you got everything... shoes, dresses...
medicines?
full course. Talked to Dr. Chen, we're all set for saturday.
wow, ok.
little person, we are going to make you in the most beautiful cabin in the whole woods.
you're gonna have to get used to this.
you see, when you're pregnant, people are gonna start talking to your stomach.
you know what, Mr. Clancy? - What?
you make me very happy.
it's gonna work this time.
Yeah.
what is that?
Oh, my god.
is it a scary ghost?!
again, mommy!
later, baby.
we still have more rooms to open up.
guests are coming.
grandma will be here soon.
I brought your blanket. And do you know what?
what?
mommy used to sleep in that bed every summer when I was a little girl.
everyone's here!
let's go.
but mommy, I wanna play up here.
please, please, please!
OK, ok, ok, ok! 5 minutes.
but be careful, baby.
OK!
how did you do that?
are you magic?
OK.
but don't talk so fast.
it's hard to understand.
let me help you with that.
Oh. Ok.
Hey, where's Nat ?
Oh, she's in my old room, playing.
old room playing?
Yeah, don't worry. She's ok.
well, I mean, the house has been locked down and closed for a few months now. It might be rustic to you, but I think it's a little Rickety.
I don't think we should be in here.
this is Hunter's room.
Where'd you go?
is this for me?
what do I do with it?
wait, is this a game?
Natalie!
Hey. Hey, sweetie, you said that Nat was in your old room, right?
Yeah. Isn't she? - No, No.
I mean, I checked all the bedrooms, but there's so many stairways, and these doors...
NAT? Natalie?
Hey, Trish, I'll check around the grounds?
the creek, please. - All right.
NAT!
Natalie? - Nat?
Nat, honey?
Natalie?
come out, come out, wherever you are!
Nat, where are you?
how come you want us to whisper?
Hey, listen.
why don't you want anyone to know you're here?
that's Natalie.
honey...
didn't you hear me calling you?
Shh. We're supposed to whisper.
Natalie, who were you talking to?
come on, honey.
there's no one in here, let's go.
you scared mommy.
mommy, there was someone in there!
you scared him away.
he wanted me to find something.
Oh, there she is. Hey, kiddo...
um, Natalie...
how did you get that?
he wants mommy to have it.
who, sweetheart? who you talking about?
this is from me.
this was...heh, this was supposed to be a surprise.
so, uh, surprise.
it's ok, you can open it.
Thanks, honey. - It's ok.
Natalie!
Natalie, what did you do?!
it wasn't me! - Natalie...
calm down, Tricia.
he's been waiting for us!
who's been waiting for us?
he says he never wants us to leave.
there's berry-picking in the morning,
directions to the trails for riding,
lunch, then at 4: 00, cocktail-croquet...
Ah, sport of champions.
and tomorrow night, the rehearsal dinner.
it's really sweet of them to organize all this.
what was he like?
Natalie's dad?
Ah, he was a little bit like Hunter.
you know, kinda low-key but friendly.
you know, they'd been together since college.
so they spent some time here.
probably...
what?
just must be hard for him to let go.
before the ant thing, I heard Natalie talking to somebody...
right, to her imaginary friend, huh?
Yeah, the friend was whispering back.
Oh, no.
you know, little kids can see spirits.
she's still young enough.
and you think it's Tricia's first husband?
he died, she's getting remarried. How would you feel?
probably about as mad as a mob of red ants.
Hey, Melinda. meet another guest.
this is Christopher Murray, an old friend of Hunter's.
Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
and you know my mom, of course, Margaret.
Yeah, well, you know, she rescued me on one of her morning walks.
it's not that easy to find this place.
well, we're obviously glad you did.
so why don't we get you settled.
sure.
Oh, yeah, this, uh, a little something for the groom.
isn't that thoughtful?
christopher and Hunter have known each other since they were 15.
now they're opening a restaurant together.
it's a place I invested in in dallas I told you about.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure it's hard to keep it all straight with this mogul.
one second we're slinging around rich guys' golf clubs,
and the next second, he is the rich guy.
hold on a second.
I mean, you were the one who actually came up with the idea for the restaurant in the first place, not me.
opening one was my idea,
but everything else was yours.
the concept, the name.
what is the name?
axiom steakhouse.
you'll have to ask the genius what that means.
Ah, come on, I can't brag about my old friend?
no, no, keep braggin'. No problem.
just save some for the toast.
let's get you a room, shall we?
see you later, darling.
Bye, Melinda. - Bye.
I'm so glad that one of his friends took initiative.
hunter's not in touch with his family,
and most of his friends are from work.
he won't admit it,
but I think he kept his list short so it wouldn't be too much about him.
where is she going?
you know, I take my eyes off her for one minute...
it's so unlike her, wandering off like that.
you know what, I can go check if you want, 'cause I'm going out for a run, anyway.
you sure? - Yeah.
Thanks.
Natalie?
Natalie?
it's pretty down here, huh?
you know, they had a stream like this where I grew up, too.
did your friend bring you out here?
it's ok if he did.
I know that most grown-ups don't believe in imaginary friends, but I do.
is he here with you right now?
he doesn't like to be around people because he's really sick.
OK, well, that's hard.
you know, your mom told me that your dad was really sick,
do you think maybe that's why he's being so shy...
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
OK, I'm sorry.
do you mind if I talk to him?
No! I don't want you to and neither does he.
why not?
because he's mad.
he's really mad.
mommy, mommy! - Well, hello, princess!
you have to come with me.
he wants you to see something.
who, your friend?
you know what, baby, I can't play right now.
the rehearsal dinner's about to begin.
mommy, he says it's important.
he says you have to come now.
please, please, please?
OK, but listen, it has to be quick.
OK. quick, quick.
come on, let's go. - All right! oh!
he wants us to follow him!
NAT...
OK, what you want to show me?
did you do that?
that means he wants you to look inside.
that's the game.
right, the game.
OK.
mommy!
who put an ice pick in the linen drawer?
did you put that in there?
No! I don't know why he did that to you.
Natalie, you know what?
stop. Stop with the imaginary friend.
no more games, not like these.
sweetie...
I love you.
I love you so much, and nothing is going to change that.
but I'm getting married tomorrow.
no matter what.
do you understand?
Natalie?
can I come in?
I heard about what happened to your mom.
it must have been really scary.
I don't know why he's being so mean to her.
what are you drawing?
that's me and mommy catching butterflies.
it's lovely.
what are the other ones?
that's Owen.
Owen?
is that your friend?
he's a little boy.
are those leg braces?
is that what you meant when you said he was sick?
why does he look so sad?
because he says something very bad is going to happen.
I - I don't mean to be dense,
but I don't understand why you're asking me.
why would I know this boy?
he's not even real.
sometimes kids will model imaginary friends after real people that they've met.
so did Nat ever see anyone maybe with leg braces?
you know, it could have been from a while ago.
maybe in the hospital when Jeremy was sick?
I have never seen Nat with this boy at the hospital or anywhere.
but I gotta say, I'm really proud of you, honey.
I mean, my gosh...
look at how creative you are...
Owen's real.
of course. in your mind, of course.
mommy, I didn't make him up.
well, let's take a look at these pictures.
someone decided to give him a red shirt and blue pants...
but I didn't draw those.
I just drew this one.
wait, that one's in marker.
those are in crayon.
we don't have any crayons here.
I know those drawings. Don't you?
why would I, mom?
you drew them.
there was a game you played that summer.
a strange little game.
with these drawings?
with your made up friend.
my made up friend?
what was the game?
it was sort of a word game, with a treasure hunt mixed in.
you'd hide objects around,
and they spelled out words somehow.
wait, wait, I... I seem to remember this,
but it's a game that you showed me, mom.
you showed me how to play.
you took the first letter of each hidden thing and put it together, right?
no, sweetheart, I remember distinctly.
I used to think, goodness, my Tricia's working awfully hard for me to believe... - Owen did it!
he hid the clues.
he still does. - Ok, honey, look...
you know what, Tricia,
why don't you and I go and take a walk?
am I supposed to believe
I just conveniently forgot all this?
that I used to see ghosts,
including a boy ghost I used to play with?
all children believe in things
they stop believing in as adults.
memories fade,
and people have no room for it next to their logic and reason.
but you do.
well, I don't have a choice.
OK.
so let's say this Owen is real. what now?
we have to find out what he wants from you.
other than wrecking my wedding?
well, we're ok in one way...
at least he wants to talk to you.
now we just have to get him to cut to the chase,
which is why I brought you here.
here?
is his voice in the babbling brook?
does he use a tree phone?
I remember my wedding day, too.
I was also a little on edge.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be disrespectful.
it's just, I'm so stressed out...
he's here.
where?
he's a little shy, so he doesn't like to stay in one place at a time...Owen.
Hi.
I'm Melinda. look, I came here to tell you
that Tricia, she is not having fun playing your game...
she's not supposed to.
are you talking to him right now?
whatever it is you want her to know, - Just tell her. - No.
OK, you don't understand.
she doesn't have time to play your game because she's getting married today.
look, since the two of you can talk to each other,
why doesn't he just play the game with you?
No!
what was that?
she has to play.
tell her if she doesn't, she'll be sorry.
tell her!
he says that you have to play.
you're the only one.
you know what?
I know you're trying to help,
but I walk down the aisle in 6 hours,
and, uh, this is, uh,
this is just too much for me.
I'll see you back at the lodge.
Trish, honey, everyone's getting together outside for some candids before the ceremony.
are you still obsessing over that seating chart?
if I could think, I'd be done already.
just tell them I'll be down in about 10 minutes.
I'd better tell them 20.
mom, seriously, if you don't stop...
OK, fine.
let's play.
what am I scared of?
any luck?
sure would help if I had more than a first name.
you tried cross referencing the lodge name or the street name...
Yeah, sorry. Of course you have.
it's just Trish is an old friend.
I'm a little worried about her.
you and me both.
if we don't get a handle on this ghost soon...
I know, don't say it.
ughh, hey. You guys seen Trish?
she was supposed to be down here to take some pictures.
Oh, she's upstairs obsessing over the seating chart.
um, I'm gonna go,
uh, track Trish down.
Bob.
who's Bob?
what is this, apples?
you want me to bob for apples?
well, she's not in her room.
I'm sure she'll be here any second, it's just...
well, we can both help you look.
breathe, let's breathe.
look at me, look at me.
just get off, just get off !
just breathe, baby, they're all got off, it's the last one.
why, why is he doing this?
when does it end?
it's gotta be a message, we just have to figure out what...
no, we don't. Ok?
please save it.
can't you see she's been through enough?
look, I know you guys trying to help my fiancee,
I appreciate it.
maybe the last thing Tricia needs to hear about right now is ghost.
OK, so please.
it's OK.
let's face all the same things on her minds, even that.
and I'm sure I'd miss Jeremy too, if I knew him, but I don't, so...
we get it, ok?
just take care of your fiance?
the game is leading to something, some answer.
there's something he wants her to know.
Natalie said you take the first letter from every word, right?
right, so far we have ants, ice pick, and leeches.
Ail? what does that mean?
ailment?
I mean, Natalie said Owen was sick, right?
so maybe the subject of the message is ailment.
Yeah, but what disease would he have
where he'd have to wear leg braces?
polio, but only if he died a long time ago.
well, the lodge has been in Tricia's family for generations.
um, there's hemiplegia.
muscular dystrophy...
Ooh, wait.
that might be what I need to get his name.
there you go.
the Owen Grace muscular dystrophy foundation.
hit the mission statement.
founded in 1981 by the Grace family
in honor of their son, Owen, who died...
but he didn't die of the disease.
he drowned in Morton creek.
which is here, right on the property.
and where Natalie was playing.
and probably Tricia, too.
wait, you don't think maybe she had something to do with his death?
Owen?
Owen.
we need to talk.
look, I know what happened.
I know that you drowned here.
I can help you, ok, but you need to talk to me.
Trish is done playing your game.
she can't be.
it's not over yet.
people don't want to play games that hurt them.
hurt Tricia?
I'm trying to help her.
with ants and ice picks and leeches?
she hates that stuff! - Exactly.
but that's a clue, too!
what does that mean?
what is a clue?
no, I'm not telling you.
it's our game, she has to figure it out.
not you.
OK...
Owen, what if I get her to keep playing?
then will you tell me what happened?
that is my best deal, ok.
you have to tell me what happened here.
this is where I first met her.
wait up!
Hey! Wait up!
but they wouldn't.
I'll be right back. Wait there.
Tricia came back with a piece of rope.
there. Now you can cross.
careful! Owen
we went back to her house and played till dark.
the next day I came back to see her again.
only she wasn't there...
but they were.
Trish?
Tricia!
Tricia didn't come.
I thought maybe she was already on the other side.
and I really wanted to play.
so that's why you're still here?
because you blame her for what happened?
no. I just told you,
she wasn't even here.
I wanted to see her, so I waited.
that's all.
and you've been waiting here ever since?
I knew she'd come back...
I just didn't know she'd be in trouble.
what kind of trouble?
it's a grown-up secret.
she wouldn't want anyone else to know.
I gave her the clues.
well, whatever it is that you gave her, it's not enough.
Yes, it is.
she just missed a few.
tell Tricia to keep playing.
I'm not suggesting that we look for more clues,
but if you could at least look at what we have...
no.
Tricia, I understand.
no, I don't think you do, Melinda.
this is my wedding day.
look what I found a few minutes ago
in what would have been my wedding bed.
it's a rope. the same one that you helped Owen cross the creek with.
rope, that's an "r," right?
OK, and we've got an A-I-L.
what is that, rail?
or liar.
that would describe the ghost for ever letting me think this would be over.
he said that you have all the clues that you need,
you just haven't figured them out yet.
what does that mean? - That we're almost there.
let's just finish this, ok?
once and for all.
Yeah, I saw those in there before.
who do they belong to?
it said "Bob" in the mirror. I...
wait...
Bob could mean...
short for Robert.
Rgl.
Natalie said that Owen led her here.
maybe there's something we missed.
not unless it's Hunter's boxers.
or this.
a gift for the groom from your old friend Chris.
what is this?
it's Hunter and Christopher from 12 years ago.
Trish, can I...?
robert Langowski.
Oh, wait.
Bob?
the liar...
it's Hunter.
what's keeping her?
there must be a dozen checks made out to Christopher for way more than we agreed on.
gosh, what does all of this mean?
whatever it is, I think Owen was protecting you.
from Hunter?
from Robert Langowski.
the restaurant in Dallas, Axiom Steakhouse?
it doesn't even exist.
christopher was blackmailing him.
threatening to out him...
the way he hid the present, the lies...
Yeah, I think there's more.
I just got off the phone with one of my police friends.
no one under the name Hunter Clayton or Robert Langowski ever went to the harvard business school.
I'm sorry, Tricia.
ireland, of course. Tricia's always wanted to go there,
so for our honeymoon...
robert Langowski!
I found it, the picture of you and Christopher.
don't touch me!
everything... none of it was real.
Tricia, darling, what's wrong?
Owen?
you did it.
Tricia knows the truth. The game is over.
you saved her from marrying Hunter.
isn't that... isn't that what you wanted?
Owen?
maybe he crossed over.
I don't think so. Did everybody leave?
people cleared out of there like the place was on fire.
Trish and her mom are packing tonight to drive down to the city.
maybe we can check in on them this weekend, go down.
so, help me out here. Yeah.
are your ghosts all-knowing now?
I mean, how did Owen know the truth?
well, Hunt was at the lodge for a few days,
you know, setting things up before the wedding.
Owen probably overheard something.
and they're not my ghosts.
sorry.
did detective Neely say what was going to happen to Hunter or Bob or whoever the heck he is?
well, there's no law lying about your background.
but finance is all about trust,
so his career is over.
marriage is about trust, too.
all right, one more trip, we should be done.
Mm-hmm. you want me to go with you?
uh, No.
um, why don't you stay here,
you know, get everything done.
and then that'll give us time to come home early, right?
Oh, right. Yeah, ok. So I'll see you there.
all right.
Owen?
Owen?
where have you been? what's wrong?
I tried to fix everything for her.
and you did. she's safe now.
hunter's gone.
he's still at the lodge.
he is?
cause...I mean, I'm sure he's gonna leave soon.
there's no reason for him to stay there now.
same goes for you.
I think you're wrong.
he's really mad.
and he's acting weird.
acting weird how?
I don't want anyone else to get hurt.
especially not you.
you've reached Jim.
if this is an emergency, chances are,
I'm already on my...
forget it.
detective Neely.
Hey, detective Neely, yeah, it's Melinda.
Hey, Melinda. What's up?
um, listen, Hunter is still at the lodge.
and Jim, he's up there...
is everything ok?
he's not answering his cell. I'm kind of freaking out.
I can't really explain it.
can you just meet me there?
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Thanks.
Hello?
is somebody here?
is somebody here?
what are you doing?
I'm waiting.
well, she's not coming back.
you know, let me ask you something, Jim.
you think that ghost waited his whole life to be with someone like her?
you need to leave.
his whole life?
that's right, I forgot, he's a ghost.
his whole life. He's dead.
look, come on. Listen to me...
come to think of it...
so am I.
right.
you know, I grew up by a lake just like this one, Jim.
when I was a kid, I used to sit on the beach
and I had to watch the summer families just come and go.
I remember I wanted to...go with 'em.
I worked really hard in my life.
but know what?
it's never been enough.
hunter...
so I told a lie.
just a small, little, itty-bitty one.
just so I could open the door, you know?
and it just got bigger and bigger.
well, now's the time to shut it down.
OK?
give me the gun, Hunter.
what, this?
dispatch 10 to 180, confirm your location, over.
280 to dispatch, I'm off highway 5 near Morton Creek.
intruder possible. Stand by.
Where's Jim?!
he's still inside. Stay here.
hunter, you rebuilt your life from nothing.
you've done that, you did it before.
do it again.
you know, you're right.
nothing.
cause that's what I am.
and that ghost is more real than you'll ever be.
No!
Jim!
Jim, it's Bobby.
try to open your eyes if you can.
I'm here with Melinda. Can you hear me?
Jim, wake up.
Jim, please wake up.
Mel.
I'm right here.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.
I tried to get here as fast as I could.
don't be sorry.
there's no pain.
you don't have to be brave.
I'm not, honey, I'm in shock.
I don't feel any pain.
Oh, god!
guys, it doesn't mean I didn't feel that.
dude, wait.
sorry about our date.
shh, it's ok.
rain check... - Yes, Yes.
we gotta go.
I'll hold you to that.
go.
I didn't know what you wanted,
so I got you hot chocolate, tea and coffee.
you're sweet.
Hey, I'll put it down here.
so any news?
he was supposed to be out of surgery 40 minutes ago. - Ms. Gordon? - yes?
Jim's surgery was successful,
and he's in stable condition.
Oh, thank god.
if you like, I can walk you down to the recovery area.
we'll wait here.
the damage was much less than we first thought.
the bullet went straight through his arm
and just barely grazed his ribs.
so he's going to be ok?
we'll be keeping an eye on him tonight.
there's always the risk of infection,
and especially with gunshot wounds
we need to keep an eye out for embolisms.
we'll have our best cardiologist watching him through the night.
thank you.
a nurse will call you in soon.
how is he?
he's resting.
I feel horrible, for so many reasons.
it's ok, it's not your fault.
he'd be happy that you're here.
Thanks.
Owen's here too.
he is?
you can talk to him if you'd like. I...
think he wants you to.
Owen...
Owen, I wish I could still see you,
like I used to.
but somehow I've gotten blind as I've gotten older.
I brought a stranger into our lives.
how could I not see who he was?
you see enough.
he says you see enough.
but I was completely... - Mommy, mommy!
yeah?
let him talk.
tell her to look hard.
ask what she sees.
he wants you to look hard...
see what you see.
nothing.
sorry, I just...
I only see you.
what?
you tell her.
he says you still see it.
what? what do I see?
everything.
everything...
that matters.
come here.
thank you, Owen.
no.
thank you.
you were my friend.
was that him?
Yeah.
what's that light?
you see it because you did a really good job.
I bet your grandma's there.
she's been waiting.
I see her.
Bye, Nat.
Bye, Trish.
Bye, Owen.
he's gone.
I love you so much, sweet girl.
has he woken up yet?
just the once, after anesthesia.
do you mind if I stay till he wakes again?
thank you.
you're more beautiful every time I see you.
you're awake.
I love you.
Mel, there's a thing that happened, um...
uh, that's called an embolism.
it's a technical term, and you don't need to know about it.
let me go get you a doctor.
no, please, just look at me, right here.
please, look at me right now.
look, look at me right here.
I want you to remember me this way, please.
code blue.
code blue,
room 335.
code blue.
room 335.
I will always love you, Melinda.
No!
always.
not you!
please, not you!
please, not you!
please, not you!
let's have a baby.
God, I love you.
you did conceive.
but your body didn't support the pregnancy.
you have to understand...
you move between the world of life and death.
sometimes you come back from one with a touch of the other.
a touch? - Of death.
be careful. It might brush off.
on what? - On what you touch.
well, what is this prescription?
it's for a hormone. it helps the embryo attach itself.
basically makes it feel more at home so it can...
and this is all we need? - Yeah.
so we're gonna be able to have a baby?
Really? I can't believe you worked on Wall Street.
neither can I. - Uh, I told you that.
no, you told me he hates suits.
I told you he hated being a suit.
a suit who is on his way to a corner office.
what can I say? - Well, I gotta tell you,
I'm glad I'm finally getting a chance to meet the legendary Jim Clancy.
he's heard a lot about you.
you can hear a lot about somebody when they've worked 80 hour weeks together.
so listen, Jim, you don't miss the anxiety and the tension of tearing open that journal the moment you wake up, huh?
uh, No.
what I'm looking forward to is seeing your wedding announcement in this sunday's times. It makes me very happy.
Oh, me, too. - Me, three.
times a thousand. A million squared. Huh?
mommy, how much longer?
just a few more things and we're off to the lake house.
and guess what?
Jim and Melinda are gonna stay with us all through the wedding.
wait until you guys see Natalie's dress.
Oh, she looks like a princess.
a ballerina.
a beautiful ballerina.
um, are you sure you're ok with everything?
place settings, furniture?
because furnishing events is kind of new to us, and we just want to get it right.
please, you guys. I love everything.
I'm not even worried about it.
well then, why don't you let us take care of the rest?
Yeah, go get some frozen yogurt with Nat , and when you get back, we'll be all packed up and ready to go, right?
Mm-hmm.
did I tell you about this guy?
Oh...thanks, honey. I love you.
love you, too.
Bye! - Bye.
Bye, Jim.
gone.
Oh, where is it? - It's right here!
Ah, it's got new satin lining and restitched embroidery.
it looks perfect. what do you think?
think she's gonna love this necklace?
she's gonna love it. - I want it.
can I have it?
see you guys in a couple?
all right. - Ok.
here, let me bring this out.
you got it? - Yep.
see you, guys.
all right. Ok, we'll see you guys.
Thanks, guys.
all right, your bag's in the car.
the car's packed.
you got everything... shoes, dresses...
medicines?
full course. Talked to Dr. Chen, we're all set for saturday.
wow, ok.
little person, we are going to make you in the most beautiful cabin in the whole woods.
you're gonna have to get used to this.
you see, when you're pregnant, people are gonna start talking to your stomach.
you know what, Mr. Clancy? - What?
you make me very happy.
it's gonna work this time.
Yeah.
what is that?
Oh, my god.
is it a scary ghost?!
again, mommy!
later, baby.
we still have more rooms to open up.
guests are coming.
grandma will be here soon.
I brought your blanket. And do you know what?
what?
mommy used to sleep in that bed every summer when I was a little girl.
everyone's here!
let's go.
but mommy, I wanna play up here.
please, please, please!
OK, ok, ok, ok! 5 minutes.
but be careful, baby.
OK!
how did you do that?
are you magic?
OK.
but don't talk so fast.
it's hard to understand.
let me help you with that.
Oh. Ok.
Hey, where's Nat ?
Oh, she's in my old room, playing.
old room playing?
Yeah, don't worry. She's ok.
well, I mean, the house has been locked down and closed for a few months now. It might be rustic to you, but I think it's a little Rickety.
I don't think we should be in here.
this is Hunter's room.
Where'd you go?
is this for me?
what do I do with it?
wait, is this a game?
Natalie!
Hey. Hey, sweetie, you said that Nat was in your old room, right?
Yeah. Isn't she? - No, No.
I mean, I checked all the bedrooms, but there's so many stairways, and these doors...
NAT? Natalie?
Hey, Trish, I'll check around the grounds?
the creek, please. - All right.
NAT!
Natalie? - Nat?
Nat, honey?
Natalie?
come out, come out, wherever you are!
Nat, where are you?
how come you want us to whisper?
Hey, listen.
why don't you want anyone to know you're here?
that's Natalie.
honey...
didn't you hear me calling you?
Shh. We're supposed to whisper.
Natalie, who were you talking to?
come on, honey.
there's no one in here, let's go.
you scared mommy.
mommy, there was someone in there!
you scared him away.
he wanted me to find something.
Oh, there she is. Hey, kiddo...
um, Natalie...
how did you get that?
he wants mommy to have it.
who, sweetheart? who you talking about?
this is from me.
this was...heh, this was supposed to be a surprise.
so, uh, surprise.
it's ok, you can open it.
Thanks, honey. - It's ok.
Natalie!
Natalie, what did you do?!
it wasn't me! - Natalie...
calm down, Tricia.
he's been waiting for us!
who's been waiting for us?
he says he never wants us to leave.
there's berry-picking in the morning,
directions to the trails for riding,
lunch, then at 4: 00, cocktail-croquet...
Ah, sport of champions.
and tomorrow night, the rehearsal dinner.
it's really sweet of them to organize all this.
what was he like?
Natalie's dad?
Ah, he was a little bit like Hunter.
you know, kinda low-key but friendly.
you know, they'd been together since college.
so they spent some time here.
probably...
what?
just must be hard for him to let go.
before the ant thing, I heard Natalie talking to somebody...
right, to her imaginary friend, huh?
Yeah, the friend was whispering back.
Oh, no.
you know, little kids can see spirits.
she's still young enough.
and you think it's Tricia's first husband?
he died, she's getting remarried. How would you feel?
probably about as mad as a mob of red ants.
Hey, Melinda. meet another guest.
this is Christopher Murray, an old friend of Hunter's.
Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
and you know my mom, of course, Margaret.
Yeah, well, you know, she rescued me on one of her morning walks.
it's not that easy to find this place.
well, we're obviously glad you did.
so why don't we get you settled.
sure.
Oh, yeah, this, uh, a little something for the groom.
isn't that thoughtful?
christopher and Hunter have known each other since they were 15.
now they're opening a restaurant together.
it's a place I invested in in dallas I told you about.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure it's hard to keep it all straight with this mogul.
one second we're slinging around rich guys' golf clubs,
and the next second, he is the rich guy.
hold on a second.
I mean, you were the one who actually came up with the idea for the restaurant in the first place, not me.
opening one was my idea,
but everything else was yours.
the concept, the name.
what is the name?
axiom steakhouse.
you'll have to ask the genius what that means.
Ah, come on, I can't brag about my old friend?
no, no, keep braggin'. No problem.
just save some for the toast.
let's get you a room, shall we?
see you later, darling.
Bye, Melinda. - Bye.
I'm so glad that one of his friends took initiative.
hunter's not in touch with his family,
and most of his friends are from work.
he won't admit it,
but I think he kept his list short so it wouldn't be too much about him.
where is she going?
you know, I take my eyes off her for one minute...
it's so unlike her, wandering off like that.
you know what, I can go check if you want, 'cause I'm going out for a run, anyway.
you sure? - Yeah.
Thanks.
Natalie?
Natalie?
it's pretty down here, huh?
you know, they had a stream like this where I grew up, too.
did your friend bring you out here?
it's ok if he did.
I know that most grown-ups don't believe in imaginary friends, but I do.
is he here with you right now?
he doesn't like to be around people because he's really sick.
OK, well, that's hard.
you know, your mom told me that your dad was really sick,
do you think maybe that's why he's being so shy...
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
OK, I'm sorry.
do you mind if I talk to him?
No! I don't want you to and neither does he.
why not?
because he's mad.
he's really mad.
mommy, mommy! - Well, hello, princess!
you have to come with me.
he wants you to see something.
who, your friend?
you know what, baby, I can't play right now.
the rehearsal dinner's about to begin.
mommy, he says it's important.
he says you have to come now.
please, please, please?
OK, but listen, it has to be quick.
OK. quick, quick.
come on, let's go. - All right! oh!
he wants us to follow him!
NAT...
OK, what you want to show me?
did you do that?
that means he wants you to look inside.
that's the game.
right, the game.
OK.
mommy!
who put an ice pick in the linen drawer?
did you put that in there?
No! I don't know why he did that to you.
Natalie, you know what?
stop. Stop with the imaginary friend.
no more games, not like these.
sweetie...
I love you.
I love you so much, and nothing is going to change that.
but I'm getting married tomorrow.
no matter what.
do you understand?
Natalie?
can I come in?
I heard about what happened to your mom.
it must have been really scary.
I don't know why he's being so mean to her.
what are you drawing?
that's me and mommy catching butterflies.
it's lovely.
what are the other ones?
that's Owen.
Owen?
is that your friend?
he's a little boy.
are those leg braces?
is that what you meant when you said he was sick?
why does he look so sad?
because he says something very bad is going to happen.
I - I don't mean to be dense,
but I don't understand why you're asking me.
why would I know this boy?
he's not even real.
sometimes kids will model imaginary friends after real people that they've met.
so did Nat ever see anyone maybe with leg braces?
you know, it could have been from a while ago.
maybe in the hospital when Jeremy was sick?
I have never seen Nat with this boy at the hospital or anywhere.
but I gotta say, I'm really proud of you, honey.
I mean, my gosh...
look at how creative you are...
Owen's real.
of course. in your mind, of course.
mommy, I didn't make him up.
well, let's take a look at these pictures.
someone decided to give him a red shirt and blue pants...
but I didn't draw those.
I just drew this one.
wait, that one's in marker.
those are in crayon.
we don't have any crayons here.
I know those drawings. Don't you?
why would I, mom?
you drew them.
there was a game you played that summer.
a strange little game.
with these drawings?
with your made up friend.
my made up friend?
what was the game?
it was sort of a word game, with a treasure hunt mixed in.
you'd hide objects around,
and they spelled out words somehow.
wait, wait, I... I seem to remember this,
but it's a game that you showed me, mom.
you showed me how to play.
you took the first letter of each hidden thing and put it together, right?
no, sweetheart, I remember distinctly.
I used to think, goodness, my Tricia's working awfully hard for me to believe... - Owen did it!
he hid the clues.
he still does. - Ok, honey, look...
you know what, Tricia,
why don't you and I go and take a walk?
am I supposed to believe
I just conveniently forgot all this?
that I used to see ghosts,
including a boy ghost I used to play with?
all children believe in things
they stop believing in as adults.
memories fade,
and people have no room for it next to their logic and reason.
but you do.
well, I don't have a choice.
OK.
so let's say this Owen is real. what now?
we have to find out what he wants from you.
other than wrecking my wedding?
well, we're ok in one way...
at least he wants to talk to you.
now we just have to get him to cut to the chase,
which is why I brought you here.
here?
is his voice in the babbling brook?
does he use a tree phone?
I remember my wedding day, too.
I was also a little on edge.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be disrespectful.
it's just, I'm so stressed out...
he's here.
where?
he's a little shy, so he doesn't like to stay in one place at a time...Owen.
Hi.
I'm Melinda. look, I came here to tell you
that Tricia, she is not having fun playing your game...
she's not supposed to.
are you talking to him right now?
whatever it is you want her to know, - Just tell her. - No.
OK, you don't understand.
she doesn't have time to play your game because she's getting married today.
look, since the two of you can talk to each other,
why doesn't he just play the game with you?
No!
what was that?
she has to play.
tell her if she doesn't, she'll be sorry.
tell her!
he says that you have to play.
you're the only one.
you know what?
I know you're trying to help,
but I walk down the aisle in 6 hours,
and, uh, this is, uh,
this is just too much for me.
I'll see you back at the lodge.
Trish, honey, everyone's getting together outside for some candids before the ceremony.
are you still obsessing over that seating chart?
if I could think, I'd be done already.
just tell them I'll be down in about 10 minutes.
I'd better tell them 20.
mom, seriously, if you don't stop...
OK, fine.
let's play.
what am I scared of?
any luck?
sure would help if I had more than a first name.
you tried cross referencing the lodge name or the street name...
Yeah, sorry. Of course you have.
it's just Trish is an old friend.
I'm a little worried about her.
you and me both.
if we don't get a handle on this ghost soon...
I know, don't say it.
ughh, hey. You guys seen Trish?
she was supposed to be down here to take some pictures.
Oh, she's upstairs obsessing over the seating chart.
um, I'm gonna go,
uh, track Trish down.
Bob.
who's Bob?
what is this, apples?
you want me to bob for apples?
well, she's not in her room.
I'm sure she'll be here any second, it's just...
well, we can both help you look.
breathe, let's breathe.
look at me, look at me.
just get off, just get off !
just breathe, baby, they're all got off, it's the last one.
why, why is he doing this?
when does it end?
it's gotta be a message, we just have to figure out what...
no, we don't. Ok?
please save it.
can't you see she's been through enough?
look, I know you guys trying to help my fiancee,
I appreciate it.
maybe the last thing Tricia needs to hear about right now is ghost.
OK, so please.
it's OK.
let's face all the same things on her minds, even that.
and I'm sure I'd miss Jeremy too, if I knew him, but I don't, so...
we get it, ok?
just take care of your fiance?
the game is leading to something, some answer.
there's something he wants her to know.
Natalie said you take the first letter from every word, right?
right, so far we have ants, ice pick, and leeches.
Ail? what does that mean?
ailment?
I mean, Natalie said Owen was sick, right?
so maybe the subject of the message is ailment.
Yeah, but what disease would he have
where he'd have to wear leg braces?
polio, but only if he died a long time ago.
well, the lodge has been in Tricia's family for generations.
um, there's hemiplegia.
muscular dystrophy...
Ooh, wait.
that might be what I need to get his name.
there you go.
the Owen Grace muscular dystrophy foundation.
hit the mission statement.
founded in 1981 by the Grace family
in honor of their son, Owen, who died...
but he didn't die of the disease.
he drowned in Morton creek.
which is here, right on the property.
and where Natalie was playing.
and probably Tricia, too.
wait, you don't think maybe she had something to do with his death?
Owen?
Owen.
we need to talk.
look, I know what happened.
I know that you drowned here.
I can help you, ok, but you need to talk to me.
Trish is done playing your game.
she can't be.
it's not over yet.
people don't want to play games that hurt them.
hurt Tricia?
I'm trying to help her.
with ants and ice picks and leeches?
she hates that stuff! - Exactly.
but that's a clue, too!
what does that mean?
what is a clue?
no, I'm not telling you.
it's our game, she has to figure it out.
