it all began one Tuesday after school.
I was waiting in the playground for my best friend Benke.
I didn't know then...
Bosse!
that this is going to be the strangest day in my life.
we must be late.
OK, I am ready.
come.
just wait and you'll see. -Wow .
it's different from the other kite stand that I've ever made.
really!
Benke and I are going to try out his new kite.
the one he and his father had made together.
we steped to first on the corner store to buy some crackers for aunt Edna.
plain crackers, not a salty ones.
Hi, Mrs. Lundin.
Hello, you two.
there you are, Bosse. -Thanks, Mrs. Lundin.
not at all, Bosse.
Bye. -Bye.
you see. I lived with aunt Edna and uncle Sixten.
because my mother died when I was born.
and no body bothered to find my father and tell him about me.
I'll be right back.
don't slam the door.
and take your boots off and wash your hands properly.
I don't want dirty marks everywhere.
aunt Edna really wanted a little girl.
but they went to the orphanage and she couldn't have.
so she had to take me instead.
did you get the crackers? Put it on the table.
don't' leave the refrigerator open.
and rinsed up the glass, Properly.
Bosse? Bosse!
why don't you answer me?
I already rinse up the glass, Aunt Edna.
Benke is waiting for me down stairs.
may I go? Please!
these are salted.
I specifically told you unsalted crackers.
but you never listen, do you?
you don't pay any attention to what you're told.
you know perfectly well your Uncle Sixten can't eat salted foods because of his heart.
and this is the thanks he gets for taking you into this home.
Bosse! Take it! Run!
stay! Easy, easy...
come on, Benke!
it's my turn.
that's right. Without the line. Little more, that's it.
I sometimes wish that Benke's father was my father, too.
I think a lot about my real father.
who he is, where he is and why I can't live with him instead I having to live with aunt and uncle Sixten.
six thirty!
and aunt Edna said I had to be home for supper at six.
I've the very latest.
Hey! Over here! Here!
Oh no!
get away!
get away!
hey you, get out from that!
go on! Get out of here!
go!
say, look who we've got here!
grab his hat!
give it back!
go take it!
let me go!
hold him!
Hey, over here!
let me go!
hold him!
Hey, over here! here!
let him go.
do you realize it's twenty to seven?
how many times must I tell you to brush out all the mud before you come in?
I spend all morning clearing the floor.
and don't hang your wet jacket on top of your uncle's coat.
why you late?
I'm sorry.
what's this?
it wasn't my fault!
into the bathroom!
look at it! Completely ruined.
just wait your Uncle Sixten gets home!
now go to your room.
Yes, aunt Edna.
I don't want to see or hear you in the rest of evening.
you took him into your home, gave him a decent education and this is the thanks you get.
it's a time you spoke to the boy.
Sixten! He is nothing but trouble.
we ought never to take him in. We stock pick, now.
and that boy's evil, Sixten. I know he is.
it's a render tree.
his father was no good bum, and he is up the same way.
a bum. That's his father.
my father is not a bum!
he isn't! He isn't! He isn't!
I'll find my father, I'll find him.
then she'll see how fine he is.
just you wait! I'll find him! You'll see.
Hello, Bosse.
Hi, Mrs. Lundin.
wait a minute, Bosse. I was expecting you.
would you like an apple?
Yes, please.
come in.
Thanks.
Mrs. Lundin was always kind to me.
gave me sweets, some fruit, some things.
since then, I thought how wonder about her because it was in her shop that it whole really began.
would you mail this for me?
sure.
use the mail box at the end of the street.
okay.
farewell, Bo Vilhelm Olsson.
to the King of The Land of Faraway.
the one you have been seeking for so long is now on his way.
he travels by day and he travels by night, and he bears in his hand the sigh of an apple of gold.
the Land of Faraway. I wish I was there.
that's much better.
who are you?
I am the spirit from The Land of Faraway.
the Land of Faraway? Is that where you come from?
it is.
and are you going back there?
I'm .
Oh, spirit! Please take me with you to The Land of Faraway.
I'm sorry, child, I can not.
Oh, but you can. I know you can. Please.
ask anything else. But not that. That is beyond my powers.
an apple of gold? Tell me, child, what is your name?
Bosse. Bo Vilhelm Olsson.
Bo Vilhelm Olsson?
and you bear your hand the sigh of an apple of gold.
you're the one I have come to fetch.
you are the one the king of The Land of Faraway has been seeking for so many years.
now grap hold my beard.
hold on tight!
flying through the garden, Garden of the roses.
and the silver poplars I can see a bird.
it is the bird of sorrow.
I hear the bird of sorrow.
singing of the long lost Land of faraway.
and my heart is trembling Then I hear my father say
Mio, my Mio.
Mio, my Mio.
where are we?
we reach The Land of Faraway.
that's green meadows island.
and that man down there is...
No! Don't tell me! I already know.
it's my father.
Yes, your father, the king of The Land of Faraway.
father.
Yes.
I knew it. I was sure I'd find you.
Mio, my Mio.
Mio? But my name is Bosse.
Mio, my son.
I have spent nine years looking for you and I missed you so.
and all the time I kept saying to myself.
Mio, my Mio.
so you see? I should know that is your name.
all that about being coop us was wrong.
I knew it. It was all wrong.
the aunt Edna, and uncle Sixten.
Yes, everything is been put right, now.
and from now on, you're going to live with me in my castle on green meadows island in The Land of Faraway.
my father took me by the hands.
and it feels so good to feel my hand in his.
aunt Edna and uncle Sixten had never done that.
I wish Aunt Edna could see him now. How wonderful he is.
it's great.
and I'm so happy to be here to found you.
Oh, that's fine.
beautiful, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
this is your horse. His name is Miramis.
my Horse?
that's right.
would you like to ride him? Come on.
bane your knee.
I don't know how to ride. Will I be able to?
Yes.
you can do anything you want, as long as you have enough courage in your heart to do it.
go on.
come on.
thank you, father. Thank you.
if only Benke could be here...
Benke?
Yes, he's my best friend.
welcome to the green meadows island.
Benke.
my name is Jum-Jum.
Jum-jum? Hi, I'm Bosse.
Bosse?
no, of course. My name is Mio.
Yes, I know.
the king sent messages through out the land with the news: Mio was come home.
Jum-Jum's father takes care of all my roses.
he is the royal gardener.
you are lucky, Mio.
Miramis is the finest horse in the whole kingdom.
would you like to ride him, too?
would I?
you're the finest, cleverest horse in the wide world.
what a wonderful horse.
Yes. His name is Miramis.
I'm Mio.
I know. I'm Jiri.
these are my two brothers and my two sisters.
is it time, yet?
no, not yet.
time for what?
you'll see.
it's very deep.
where is the bucket?
it isn't that kind of a well, it's a whispering well.
a what?
a whispering well. That's what it's called.
welcome, Prince Mio.
you know who I am?
of course. Everyone knows who you are, Mio.
I've began to realize that. But I still don't know who everyone is.
what's your name?
Nonno. And these are my sheep.
what a strange music. Please teach me how to play it.
sure.
here.
this belong to my two brothers, but they are not been needed any more.
just put the flute to your mouth and listen how the wind sings through leaves.
Nonno taught us how to play these strange tube.
and he told us that his father told him how to play it.
and his father had learned it from his father.
for thousands of thousands of years, Nonno said, the shepherds on green meadows island had been playing it.
here you are.
thank you!
Thanks.
this is the best bread I've ever tested.
we call it "breads that satisfy all hunger."
take it. You'll need it.
thank you.
no, please!
what's going on?
you'll see.
Yes.
look into the well, but in perfectly quiet.
once upon the time there lived a cruel and evil knight in the blackest and crimest castle.
he was so evil he had carried of all the children from the peaceful country where they lived.
and his guardians and spies all had hearts of the hardest stone.
and for thousands of thousands of years, the people lived in fear and terror of the evil knight.
those children who refused to serve him, he turned them to birds.
turn the circle above the Dead Lake and to the day when all the christ left his terrible castle would be a pile stones.
but one day, the king's son would ride in through moonlight
he rode to the Forest of Mysteries.
accompanied by a single friend, on a beautiful white horse.
father, where is the Forest of Mysteries?
why do you ask, Mio?
I want to ride there tonight.
so soon...
please, father. I want to.
so soon...
would you rather I didn't go?
are you worried about me riding into the Forest of Mysteries at night?
no. Why? Should I be?
a forest that sleeps peacefully in the moonlight can do no harm.
do you want me to stay here with you instead?
no, Mio. The Forest of Mysteries awaits you.
you may ride through it as long as Miramis can carry you.
but there's one thing you must know.
there is something called The Land Outside which lies beyond The Forest of Mysteries.
who lives there?
kato, the evil knight.
you are so dear to me, Mio.
but my heart, it hurt so the thought of Kato.
if your heart hurt the thought of him, then don't think of him.
you are right. I'll try not to.
and you won't be sad?
I won't.
promise.
I promise.
you go now, Mio.
go! Go!
thank you, father.
I'll come back very soon. I promise.
Jum-Jum, guess what I'm going to do tonight?
when the moon is up, I'm going to ride through The Forest of Mysteries.
at last.
Yes. Do you want to come, too?
do I want to come, too?
of course, I do. Look what I've got.
these can keep us warm.
and I've got some of the bread that satisfies all hunger.
it's the longest bridge in the world.
this is all pass your father's kingdom and the land of the other side of world, too.
are those my father's guards?
Yes.
at night, they draw the bridge so that no one can cross over onto green meadows island.
that way we can all sleep safe at night.
Why? Who lives on the other side?
kato, the evil knight from The Land Outside.
Kato!
I must ride out to the other side. Come on.
stop them!
wait!
Mio!
Oh no! Stop! Miramis!
stop!
Miramis!
that was just like fly!
I didn't know Miramis can do it.
there's still so much you don't know, Mio.
where does it lead to?
I don't know. Let's find out.
come on.
wait here, Miramis.
Mio and Jum-Jum.
what's kept you so long? Come in.
don't be afraid.
come in.
seasons have passed when I waited
the prince and his faithful companion.
why do you sit at night weaving?
I weave the fabric dreams that can only be done at night.
the abstract fairy tales, the fabric dreams, are always wove at night.
lend me have your cape, Mio. You've torn it.
why does that bird singing like that?
Why?
it's a bird of grave, singing for my child. My daughter, who is taken away.
who took her away from you? Who?
no, don't tell me. I already know.
please don't mention that dreadful name.
no, or the moon was turn black.
it was Kato. Kato.
every time I heard that awful name, I feel so frightened.
I didn't know why or what I was supposed to do.
but as I listened to the bird of grave, as I heard the way it sang.
something strange happened inside me.
Jum-Jum, I'm going to The Land Outside.
Yes, I know.
how can you?
I didn't know myself until right now.
I've know that for long you'll go to The Land Outside, Mio.
everyone knows.
everyone?
Yes. The bird of grave knows, so does Nonno.
his flute sings about it.
and Jiri and all his brothers and sisters.
and whispering well knows it, too.
everyone knows.
and my father, the king?
he's always know.
and he wants me to go?
Yes.
I'm frightened, Jum-Jum. Why me?
only a melt child of royal blood can fight the Evil Knight.
only a king's son.
farewell, Jum-Jum.
I'm going with you.
no, you can not follow me to where I'm going.
I'm going with you.
the legend says.
a malt child of royal blood riding a white horse, accompany by a single friend.
that was set for thousands of thousands of years ago.
you can't change that.
you are a true friend, Jum-Jum.
Mio, your cape.
a finest fabric which I've ever wove.
and I give it to the one who'll rescues my daughter, Millimani.
thank you.
are we ready?
Yes, we are.
and so, we set off for The Land Outside, to do battle with evil knight, Kato.
and to rescue Millimani, the weaver woman's daughter.
Nonno two brothers
Jiri's two sisters and all the other children Kato had taken away.
the Land Outside.
we've reached The Land Outside.
come on!
Kato castle.
you should have a sword.
Yes.
please help me!
what's that?
I'm so very hungry!
it might be a trap.
but what if it isn't?
help!
whoever it is, we must find him and help him.
wait here, Miramis.
don't be afraid. We won't be long.
here.
Mio! Help me, Mio!
help me!
are you all right?
Yes. Thanks.
help me!
come on.
don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
we are not going to hurt you.
we heard your cries. We heard how hungry you were.
so we brought you some bread.
take it . don't be afraid.
here.
it's... bread.
bread to satisfy all hunger.
why have you come here?
we come to fight evil knight, Kato.
shush!
go back to where you come from. Go back before it's too late!
no, I will not! I came to here to fight evil knight Kato. And I will.
shush!
don't make so much noise about it. His spies would hear you.
they might be out there, or even in here, or both of there or anywhere.
spies everywhere.
you mean Kato's spies?
hold your tongue, are you tired of life?
whatever you do, don't trust anyone. You heard?
don't go into anyone's house. Even if you think you are among friends.
you won't be. They'll betray you, they'll handed you over to him.
don't trust anyone ever!
do you understand?
not even me.
how do you know that I wasn't his spies after you?
Hey, boy?
I don't know, but I don't think you will.
maybe not.
there are still a few people left in this land who won't betray you.
and there are still a few people who can fold weapon.
you are right. We'll need a weapon.
Mio must have a sword.
what's that?
it came from over there.
how did it get here?
take it to the castle!
you said that there was still people left who can forge weapons.
go to the forge of swords, and tell him that I, Eno, sent you.
how do I find the forger of swords?
look in the deepest hole, in the blackest mountains.
go through the Dead Forest. Go now!
Jum-Jum, some thing has happened to Miramis.
let's go!
come on! Bring it back!
come on, Jum-Jum.
come on! Let's go.
Miramis.
be quiet! Or they'll catch us, too.
hold the pack!
Miramis... Miramis
don't cry, Mio.
hold it's head.
come on.
we must find the forger of swords. You need a sword.
Yes, but first we got to get through the Dead Forest.
poor Miramis.
how would we get to the forger of swords without him.
I wanted to turn back, but I was king's son, a prince.
I had to go on.
for Miramise's sake.
and for the sake of all the children Kato had taken away.
well, now we are inside the Dead Forest.
Yes, I'm wondering if we ever come out again.
it's so quiet in cripping.
wait! I heard something.
so did I.
it came from over there.
no. I think it was over there.
go!
look! Through the trees.
Kato's spies.
I do think they've seen us.
where could we hide?
it's no where!
there! Get them!
Oh, Jum-Jum, it's all over now!
after them!
don't let them get away!
take them!
take them!
where they are?
Mio, look! Here!
where could they go?
no one here!
this way!
the tree saved us. I wonder why.
perhaps it hates Kato.
it must been his evilist that killed the full trees in the forest.
I don't think the tree can ever forgive anyone for doing that.
come on. We've got to find the Forge of Swords.
look at that! The blackest mountain.
that must be it.
come on!
now we found the mountain, Jum-Jum. How do we get in?
over there!
quick!
come on!
we pass them! Go back there!
after them. They mustn't get away!
over here!
Jum-Jum!
we got them. Come on. We got them.
there's no way out here.
come on!
get quick!
they must be here somewhere!
where could they go?
over here, I saw them!
maybe we pass over them!
well, now we are inside the blackest mountains.
but will we ever find a way out of here?
the deepest hole in the blackest mountain.
that's what Eno said.
that's what the Forger of Swords lives.
Jum-Jum!
Jum-Jum!
where are you?
Mio!
Jum-Jum! Jum-Jum!
Mio!
Jum-Jum!
Mio!
Jum-Jum , are you alright?
Yes.
but now that we found each other. Which way would we go?
I don't know.
but it doesn't matter as long as we go together.
who is playing in my mountain?
a prince and his companion.
a prince from The Land of Faraway. Prince Mio.
that's who plays in your mountain.
what a clear brow. What a clear eyes.
and how beauty to see you are playing in my mountain.
I've came to ask you for a sword. Eno sent me.
why you want a sword?
I'm going to fight evil knight Kato.
death to the Evil Knight! Death to Kato!
you see those swords?
they are the finest and sharpest swords in the world!
everyone of them made by these hands. For Kato.
I fold whole Kato's swords.
then, why did you shut "Death to Kato"?
because no one hates Kato more than I do.
why are you chained to the mountain?
why don't you melt your chain on the forge and escape?
I can't! Because Kato he seals me in cave.
that is the fire hot can't melt it. And no hammer strong enough to smash it.
it isn't easy to break the chains of hatred.
why chains of hatred?
I forged the all Kato's swords.
I forged the swords that killed innocent and good.
Kato needs me. He needs my swords.
that's why he keeps me in a chain to the mountain. Day and night!
but...
there is one thing he doesn't know.
he doesn't know about this!
for the thousand years,
I've been forging a sword that could cut through the hardest stone.
finally, last night, I've finished it. Only last night.
this was not forged to kill the innocent and good people.
this was forged to kill only one person, Kato!
but why does it have to cut through stone?
because Kato has a heart of stone.
does he?
Yes.
and the Iron Claw.
he doesn't have left hand. He has an Iron Claw in his hand.
and with it, he rips out the heart of everyone he catches.
and he puts in a heart of stone like his heart of stone.
give me that sword.
you'll never need that again.
come.
you see this. The way out the mountain.
it's too narrow.
too narrow for me, but not for you.
follow the stream all the way. It lead you to the show of Dead Lake.
it's a raft there to take you across the water to Kato's castle.
good luck to you. Good luck.
soon, soon! It would be time for your last fight, Kato.
beyond your watch, Prince Mio! Be aware of the iron clone!
as soon as you see it, strike with your sword. Or it can be too late, too late, prince Mio.
we have to climb the rock. It's the only way to get inside the castle.
come on.
give me your hand.
hand me a torch, quickly.
get down!
I heard something.
just a little further.
where is the torch, quick?
the guards.
here.
there is someone down there.
I can't see anyone.
tilt the torch lower. Lower.
I told you there's no one.
I heard something.
damn bird!
poor bird.
get another torch!
maybe they'll try on the other side. Let's go out and look.
hold on the guards!
come on, Jum-Jum!
Ouch!
Mio!
Jum-Jum, give me your hands!
Ouch!
Kato.
welcome, Prince Mio.
this is the most dangerous sword I've ever seen in my castle.
it can not be used to kill the good and the innocent.
what should I do with it?
I will throw it into the Dead Lake.
for this is the most dangerous sword I've ever held.
what should I do with my two enemies?
what should I do with my enemies who have come so far to kill me?
shall I cut them with others?
shall I turn their arms into wings?
then sent them out to circle around the Dead Lake for thousands of thousands of years, screeching?
shall I rip out their hearts and replace with hearts of stone?
and have them respect voice?
I can lock them up the tower until they die of hunger.
Yes. I will lock them up the tower.
in my castle, it takes one night to die of huger.
that is how long a night, it is how terrible of hunger.
and when the night is over there will be nothing left of prince Mio and his faithful friend, but little pile of white bones.
take them.
put seven times, seven guards in the carry doors between the tower and my room.
and when the night is over,
I'll go to the tower and I'll look at their little pile of white bones.
farewell, Prince Mio. Farewell.
Miramis!
Miramis!
mi... Miramis!
Miramis!
get down there! And the other one, too.
shut as loud as you like. No one will ever hear you.
when the night is over, all there will be left of us is little pile of bones.
I didn't want to die.
I didn't want to wend up a pile of bones.
I wanted to be back on the green meadows island with my father.
now, I would never see him again, or Miramis.
I'm tired. And I'm hungry.
I've never been so hungry in all my life.
I'm hungry, too.
if only we had left some of bread that satisfies all huger.
Mio! Mio, where are you?
here!
where?
right next you.
I can't see you!
you really scared me.
what happened? Where did you hide?
it's a new lining in the cape the weaver woman made for me.
when I put it on inside out, I become invisible.
look!
if only we could open the door.
then you can slyly pass the guards on your invisible cape.
and escape back to The Land of Faraway.
and what about you, Jum-jum?
I'll have to stay here. You have only got one invisible cape.
Yes, and only one friend.
if we have to die, we should die together.
my sword!
now I can fight Kato.
but what about the locks on the door?
how would you get pass seven times seven guards posted between here and Kato's room?
my sword will cut through the locks and my cape will hide me from the guards.
and if I never return, my very last thought would be of you and my father.
good luck, Mio. Good luck.
I heard a click.
I know that's a click.
face me, Kato! Your time is come!
you have to defeat me, Prince Mio.
strike, and make sure you in it's true.
I have known for a long time this moment would come.
but remember, prince Mio.
even if you kill me, you can not destroy evil.
another Kato would rule, and another, and another...
what can you do about it? Nothing.
let me leave.
take your faithful little friend and your white horse.
and leave this place . go home, to your father.
he's waiting for you. Go home before it is too late.
Oh! No! I came here to destroy you. And I will!
and even if you kill me, another prince will come. And another, and another.
then you must die.
at last, I am free of this heart of stone.
it has crushed and smothered me so long.
the spell had been broken. They were all down there.
but there won't birds anymore. They were free.
the weaver woman's daughter,
Nonno's two brothers,
Jiri's little sister.
and all the other children Kato had taken away.
what did I say?
the time has come for Kato's last fight.
that's what I said, and I was right.
wasn't I, Prince Mio?
look, look!
it was growing! It was growing in the Dead Forest. That's where I found it.
I knew you would succeed.
father.
Mio.
Mio, my Mio.
it's a while now since I first came to The Land of Faraway.
and I wonder what Aunt Edna and Uncle Sixten said when I never came home.
they cared so little about me.
I doubted if they even noticed that I have gone.
aunt Edna probably thinks that I'm still sitting on a park bench.
but she is wrong.
she won't find me there.
because I am here, in The Land of Faraway.
together with my father.
who my love so much and who loves me so much .
that's how it is.
Bo Vilhelm Olsson is in The Land of Faraway.
and he's very, very happy with his father, the king.

it all began one Tuesday after school.
I was waiting in the playground for my best friend Benke.
I didn't know then...
Bosse!
that this is going to be the strangest day in my life.
we must be late.
OK, I am ready.
come.
just wait and you'll see. -Wow .
it's different from the other kite stand that I've ever made.
really!
Benke and I are going to try out his new kite.
the one he and his father had made together.
we steped to first on the corner store to buy some crackers for aunt Edna.
plain crackers, not a salty ones.
Hi, Mrs. Lundin.
Hello, you two.
there you are, Bosse. -Thanks, Mrs. Lundin.
not at all, Bosse.
Bye. -Bye.
you see. I lived with aunt Edna and uncle Sixten.
because my mother died when I was born.
and no body bothered to find my father and tell him about me.
I'll be right back.
don't slam the door.
and take your boots off and wash your hands properly.
I don't want dirty marks everywhere.
aunt Edna really wanted a little girl.
but they went to the orphanage and she couldn't have.
so she had to take me instead.
did you get the crackers? Put it on the table.
don't' leave the refrigerator open.
and rinsed up the glass, Properly.
Bosse? Bosse!
why don't you answer me?
I already rinse up the glass, Aunt Edna.
Benke is waiting for me down stairs.
may I go? Please!
these are salted.
I specifically told you unsalted crackers.
but you never listen, do you?
you don't pay any attention to what you're told.
you know perfectly well your Uncle Sixten can't eat salted foods because of his heart.
and this is the thanks he gets for taking you into this home.
Bosse! Take it! Run!
stay! Easy, easy...
come on, Benke!
it's my turn.
that's right. Without the line. Little more, that's it.
I sometimes wish that Benke's father was my father, too.
I think a lot about my real father.
who he is, where he is and why I can't live with him instead I having to live with aunt and uncle Sixten.
six thirty!
and aunt Edna said I had to be home for supper at six.
I've the very latest.
Hey! Over here! Here!
Oh no!
get away!
get away!
hey you, get out from that!
go on! Get out of here!
go!
say, look who we've got here!
grab his hat!
give it back!
go take it!
let me go!
hold him!
Hey, over here!
let me go!
hold him!
Hey, over here! here!
let him go.
do you realize it's twenty to seven?
how many times must I tell you to brush out all the mud before you come in?
I spend all morning clearing the floor.
and don't hang your wet jacket on top of your uncle's coat.
why you late?
I'm sorry.
what's this?
it wasn't my fault!
into the bathroom!
look at it! Completely ruined.
just wait your Uncle Sixten gets home!
now go to your room.
Yes, aunt Edna.
I don't want to see or hear you in the rest of evening.
you took him into your home, gave him a decent education and this is the thanks you get.
it's a time you spoke to the boy.
Sixten! He is nothing but trouble.
we ought never to take him in. We stock pick, now.
and that boy's evil, Sixten. I know he is.
it's a render tree.
his father was no good bum, and he is up the same way.
a bum. That's his father.
my father is not a bum!
he isn't! He isn't! He isn't!
I'll find my father, I'll find him.
then she'll see how fine he is.
just you wait! I'll find him! You'll see.
Hello, Bosse.
Hi, Mrs. Lundin.
wait a minute, Bosse. I was expecting you.
would you like an apple?
Yes, please.
come in.
Thanks.
Mrs. Lundin was always kind to me.
gave me sweets, some fruit, some things.
since then, I thought how wonder about her because it was in her shop that it whole really began.
would you mail this for me?
sure.
use the mail box at the end of the street.
okay.
farewell, Bo Vilhelm Olsson.
to the King of The Land of Faraway.
the one you have been seeking for so long is now on his way.
he travels by day and he travels by night, and he bears in his hand the sigh of an apple of gold.
the Land of Faraway. I wish I was there.
that's much better.
who are you?
I am the spirit from The Land of Faraway.
the Land of Faraway? Is that where you come from?
it is.
and are you going back there?
I'm .
Oh, spirit! Please take me with you to The Land of Faraway.
I'm sorry, child, I can not.
Oh, but you can. I know you can. Please.
ask anything else. But not that. That is beyond my powers.
an apple of gold? Tell me, child, what is your name?
Bosse. Bo Vilhelm Olsson.
Bo Vilhelm Olsson?
and you bear your hand the sigh of an apple of gold.
you're the one I have come to fetch.
you are the one the king of The Land of Faraway has been seeking for so many years.
now grap hold my beard.
hold on tight!
flying through the garden, Garden of the roses.
and the silver poplars I can see a bird.
it is the bird of sorrow.
I hear the bird of sorrow.
singing of the long lost Land of faraway.
and my heart is trembling Then I hear my father say
Mio, my Mio.
Mio, my Mio.
where are we?
we reach The Land of Faraway.
that's green meadows island.
and that man down there is...
No! Don't tell me! I already know.
it's my father.
Yes, your father, the king of The Land of Faraway.
father.
Yes.
I knew it. I was sure I'd find you.
Mio, my Mio.
Mio? But my name is Bosse.
Mio, my son.
I have spent nine years looking for you and I missed you so.
and all the time I kept saying to myself.
Mio, my Mio.
so you see? I should know that is your name.
all that about being coop us was wrong.
I knew it. It was all wrong.
the aunt Edna, and uncle Sixten.
Yes, everything is been put right, now.
and from now on, you're going to live with me in my castle on green meadows island in The Land of Faraway.
my father took me by the hands.
and it feels so good to feel my hand in his.
aunt Edna and uncle Sixten had never done that.
I wish Aunt Edna could see him now. How wonderful he is.
it's great.
and I'm so happy to be here to found you.
Oh, that's fine.
beautiful, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
this is your horse. His name is Miramis.
my Horse?
that's right.
would you like to ride him? Come on.
bane your knee.
I don't know how to ride. Will I be able to?
Yes.
you can do anything you want, as long as you have enough courage in your heart to do it.
go on.
come on.
thank you, father. Thank you.
if only Benke could be here...
Benke?
Yes, he's my best friend.
welcome to the green meadows island.
Benke.
my name is Jum-Jum.
Jum-jum? Hi, I'm Bosse.
Bosse?
no, of course. My name is Mio.
Yes, I know.
the king sent messages through out the land with the news: Mio was come home.
Jum-Jum's father takes care of all my roses.
he is the royal gardener.
you are lucky, Mio.
Miramis is the finest horse in the whole kingdom.
would you like to ride him, too?
would I?
you're the finest, cleverest horse in the wide world.
what a wonderful horse.
Yes. His name is Miramis.
I'm Mio.
I know. I'm Jiri.
these are my two brothers and my two sisters.
is it time, yet?
no, not yet.
time for what?
you'll see.
it's very deep.
where is the bucket?
it isn't that kind of a well, it's a whispering well.
a what?
a whispering well. That's what it's called.
welcome, Prince Mio.
you know who I am?
of course. Everyone knows who you are, Mio.
I've began to realize that. But I still don't know who everyone is.
what's your name?
Nonno. And these are my sheep.
what a strange music. Please teach me how to play it.
sure.
here.
this belong to my two brothers, but they are not been needed any more.
just put the flute to your mouth and listen how the wind sings through leaves.
Nonno taught us how to play these strange tube.
and he told us that his father told him how to play it.
and his father had learned it from his father.
for thousands of thousands of years, Nonno said, the shepherds on green meadows island had been playing it.
here you are.
thank you!
Thanks.
this is the best bread I've ever tested.
we call it "breads that satisfy all hunger."
take it. You'll need it.
thank you.
no, please!
what's going on?
you'll see.
Yes.
look into the well, but in perfectly quiet.
once upon the time there lived a cruel and evil knight in the blackest and crimest castle.
he was so evil he had carried of all the children from the peaceful country where they lived.
and his guardians and spies all had hearts of the hardest stone.
and for thousands of thousands of years, the people lived in fear and terror of the evil knight.
those children who refused to serve him, he turned them to birds.
turn the circle above the Dead Lake and to the day when all the christ left his terrible castle would be a pile stones.
but one day, the king's son would ride in through moonlight
he rode to the Forest of Mysteries.
accompanied by a single friend, on a beautiful white horse.
father, where is the Forest of Mysteries?
why do you ask, Mio?
I want to ride there tonight.
so soon...
please, father. I want to.
so soon...
would you rather I didn't go?
are you worried about me riding into the Forest of Mysteries at night?
no. Why? Should I be?
a forest that sleeps peacefully in the moonlight can do no harm.
do you want me to stay here with you instead?
no, Mio. The Forest of Mysteries awaits you.
you may ride through it as long as Miramis can carry you.
but there's one thing you must know.
there is something called The Land Outside which lies beyond The Forest of Mysteries.
who lives there?
kato, the evil knight.
you are so dear to me, Mio.
but my heart, it hurt so the thought of Kato.
if your heart hurt the thought of him, then don't think of him.
you are right. I'll try not to.
and you won't be sad?
I won't.
promise.
I promise.
you go now, Mio.
go! Go!
thank you, father.
I'll come back very soon. I promise.
Jum-Jum, guess what I'm going to do tonight?
when the moon is up, I'm going to ride through The Forest of Mysteries.
at last.
Yes. Do you want to come, too?
do I want to come, too?
of course, I do. Look what I've got.
these can keep us warm.
and I've got some of the bread that satisfies all hunger.
it's the longest bridge in the world.
this is all pass your father's kingdom and the land of the other side of world, too.
are those my father's guards?
Yes.
at night, they draw the bridge so that no one can cross over onto green meadows island.
that way we can all sleep safe at night.
Why? Who lives on the other side?
kato, the evil knight from The Land Outside.
Kato!
I must ride out to the other side. Come on.
stop them!
wait!
Mio!
Oh no! Stop! Miramis!
stop!
Miramis!
that was just like fly!
I didn't know Miramis can do it.
there's still so much you don't know, Mio.
where does it lead to?
I don't know. Let's find out.
come on.
wait here, Miramis.
Mio and Jum-Jum.
what's kept you so long? Come in.
don't be afraid.
come in.
seasons have passed when I waited
the prince and his faithful companion.
why do you sit at night weaving?
I weave the fabric dreams that can only be done at night.
the abstract fairy tales, the fabric dreams, are always wove at night.
lend me have your cape, Mio. You've torn it.
why does that bird singing like that?
Why?
it's a bird of grave, singing for my child. My daughter, who is taken away.
who took her away from you? Who?
no, don't tell me. I already know.
please don't mention that dreadful name.
no, or the moon was turn black.
it was Kato. Kato.
every time I heard that awful name, I feel so frightened.
I didn't know why or what I was supposed to do.
but as I listened to the bird of grave, as I heard the way it sang.
something strange happened inside me.
Jum-Jum, I'm going to The Land Outside.
Yes, I know.
how can you?
I didn't know myself until right now.
I've know that for long you'll go to The Land Outside, Mio.
everyone knows.
everyone?
Yes. The bird of grave knows, so does Nonno.
his flute sings about it.
and Jiri and all his brothers and sisters.
and whispering well knows it, too.
everyone knows.
and my father, the king?
he's always know.
and he wants me to go?
Yes.
I'm frightened, Jum-Jum. Why me?
only a melt child of royal blood can fight the Evil Knight.
only a king's son.
farewell, Jum-Jum.
I'm going with you.
no, you can not follow me to where I'm going.
I'm going with you.
the legend says.
a malt child of royal blood riding a white horse, accompany by a single friend.
that was set for thousands of thousands of years ago.
you can't change that.
you are a true friend, Jum-Jum.
Mio, your cape.
a finest fabric which I've ever wove.
and I give it to the one who'll rescues my daughter, Millimani.
thank you.
are we ready?
Yes, we are.
and so, we set off for The Land Outside, to do battle with evil knight, Kato.
and to rescue Millimani, the weaver woman's daughter.
Nonno two brothers
Jiri's two sisters and all the other children Kato had taken away.
the Land Outside.
we've reached The Land Outside.
come on!
Kato castle.
you should have a sword.
Yes.
please help me!
what's that?
I'm so very hungry!
it might be a trap.
but what if it isn't?
help!
whoever it is, we must find him and help him.
wait here, Miramis.
don't be afraid. We won't be long.
here.
Mio! Help me, Mio!
help me!
are you all right?
Yes. Thanks.
help me!
come on.
don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
we are not going to hurt you.
we heard your cries. We heard how hungry you were.
so we brought you some bread.
take it . don't be afraid.
here.
it's... bread.
bread to satisfy all hunger.
why have you come here?
we come to fight evil knight, Kato.
shush!
go back to where you come from. Go back before it's too late!
no, I will not! I came to here to fight evil knight Kato. And I will.
shush!
don't make so much noise about it. His spies would hear you.
they might be out there, or even in here, or both of there or anywhere.
spies everywhere.
you mean Kato's spies?
hold your tongue, are you tired of life?
whatever you do, don't trust anyone. You heard?
don't go into anyone's house. Even if you think you are among friends.
you won't be. They'll betray you, they'll handed you over to him.
don't trust anyone ever!
do you understand?
not even me.
how do you know that I wasn't his spies after you?
Hey, boy?
I don't know, but I don't think you will.
maybe not.
there are still a few people left in this land who won't betray you.
and there are still a few people who can fold weapon.
you are right. We'll need a weapon.
Mio must have a sword.
what's that?
it came from over there.
how did it get here?
take it to the castle!
you said that there was still people left who can forge weapons.
go to the forge of swords, and tell him that I, Eno, sent you.
how do I find the forger of swords?
look in the deepest hole, in the blackest mountains.
go through the Dead Forest. Go now!
Jum-Jum, some thing has happened to Miramis.
let's go!
come on! Bring it back!
come on, Jum-Jum.
come on! Let's go.
Miramis.
be quiet! Or they'll catch us, too.
hold the pack!
Miramis... Miramis
don't cry, Mio.
hold it's head.
come on.
we must find the forger of swords. You need a sword.
Yes, but first we got to get through the Dead Forest.
poor Miramis.
how would we get to the forger of swords without him.
I wanted to turn back, but I was king's son, a prince.
I had to go on.
for Miramise's sake.
and for the sake of all the children Kato had taken away.
well, now we are inside the Dead Forest.
Yes, I'm wondering if we ever come out again.
it's so quiet in cripping.
wait! I heard something.
so did I.
it came from over there.
no. I think it was over there.
go!
look! Through the trees.
Kato's spies.
I do think they've seen us.
where could we hide?
it's no where!
there! Get them!
Oh, Jum-Jum, it's all over now!
after them!
don't let them get away!
take them!
take them!
where they are?
Mio, look! Here!
where could they go?
no one here!
this way!
the tree saved us. I wonder why.
perhaps it hates Kato.
it must been his evilist that killed the full trees in the forest.
I don't think the tree can ever forgive anyone for doing that.
come on. We've got to find the Forge of Swords.
look at that! The blackest mountain.
that must be it.
come on!
now we found the mountain, Jum-Jum. How do we get in?
over there!
quick!
come on!
we pass them! Go back there!
after them. They mustn't get away!
over here!
Jum-Jum!
we got them. Come on. We got them.
there's no way out here.
come on!
get quick!
they must be here somewhere!
where could they go?
over here, I saw them!
maybe we pass over them!
well, now we are inside the blackest mountains.
but will we ever find a way out of here?
the deepest hole in the blackest mountain.
that's what Eno said.
that's what the Forger of Swords lives.
Jum-Jum!
Jum-Jum!
where are you?
Mio!
Jum-Jum! Jum-Jum!
Mio!
Jum-Jum!
Mio!
Jum-Jum , are you alright?
Yes.
but now that we found each other. Which way would we go?
I don't know.
but it doesn't matter as long as we go together.
who is playing in my mountain?
a prince and his companion.
a prince from The Land of Faraway. Prince Mio.
that's who plays in your mountain.
what a clear brow. What a clear eyes.
and how beauty to see you are playing in my mountain.
I've came to ask you for a sword. Eno sent me.
why you want a sword?
I'm going to fight evil knight Kato.
death to the Evil Knight! Death to Kato!
you see those swords?
they are the finest and sharpest swords in the world!
everyone of them made by these hands. For Kato.
I fold whole Kato's swords.
then, why did you shut "Death to Kato"?
because no one hates Kato more than I do.
why are you chained to the mountain?
why don't you melt your chain on the forge and escape?
I can't! Because Kato he seals me in cave.
that is the fire hot can't melt it. And no hammer strong enough to smash it.
it isn't easy to break the chains of hatred.
why chains of hatred?
I forged the all Kato's swords.
I forged the swords that killed innocent and good.
Kato needs me. He needs my swords.
that's why he keeps me in a chain to the mountain. Day and night!
but...
there is one thing he doesn't know.
he doesn't know about this!
for the thousand years,
I've been forging a sword that could cut through the hardest stone.
finally, last night, I've finished it. Only last night.
this was not forged to kill the innocent and good people.
this was forged to kill only one person, Kato!
but why does it have to cut through stone?
because Kato has a heart of stone.
does he?
Yes.
and the Iron Claw.
he doesn't have left hand. He has an Iron Claw in his hand.
and with it, he rips out the heart of everyone he catches.
and he puts in a heart of stone like his heart of stone.
give me that sword.
you'll never need that again.
come.
you see this. The way out the mountain.
it's too narrow.
too narrow for me, but not for you.
follow the stream all the way. It lead you to the show of Dead Lake.
it's a raft there to take you across the water to Kato's castle.
good luck to you. Good luck.
soon, soon! It would be time for your last fight, Kato.
beyond your watch, Prince Mio! Be aware of the iron clone!
as soon as you see it, strike with your sword. Or it can be too late, too late, prince Mio.
we have to climb the rock. It's the only way to get inside the castle.
come on.
give me your hand.
hand me a torch, quickly.
get down!
I heard something.
just a little further.
where is the torch, quick?
the guards.
here.
there is someone down there.
I can't see anyone.
tilt the torch lower. Lower.
I told you there's no one.
I heard something.
damn bird!
poor bird.
get another torch!
maybe they'll try on the other side. Let's go out and look.
hold on the guards!
come on, Jum-Jum!
Ouch!
Mio!
Jum-Jum, give me your hands!
Ouch!
Kato.
welcome, Prince Mio.
this is the most dangerous sword I've ever seen in my castle.
it can not be used to kill the good and the innocent.
what should I do with it?
I will throw it into the Dead Lake.
for this is the most dangerous sword I've ever held.
what should I do with my two enemies?
what should I do with my enemies who have come so far to kill me?
shall I cut them with others?
shall I turn their arms into wings?
then sent them out to circle around the Dead Lake for thousands of thousands of years, screeching?
shall I rip out their hearts and replace with hearts of stone?
and have them respect voice?
I can lock them up the tower until they die of hunger.
Yes. I will lock them up the tower.
in my castle, it takes one night to die of huger.
that is how long a night, it is how terrible of hunger.
and when the night is over there will be nothing left of prince Mio and his faithful friend, but little pile of white bones.
take them.
put seven times, seven guards in the carry doors between the tower and my room.
and when the night is over,
I'll go to the tower and I'll look at their little pile of white bones.
farewell, Prince Mio. Farewell.
Miramis!
Miramis!
mi... Miramis!
Miramis!
get down there! And the other one, too.
shut as loud as you like. No one will ever hear you.
when the night is over, all there will be left of us is little pile of bones.
I didn't want to die.
I didn't want to wend up a pile of bones.
I wanted to be back on the green meadows island with my father.
now, I would never see him again, or Miramis.
I'm tired. And I'm hungry.
I've never been so hungry in all my life.
I'm hungry, too.
if only we had left some of bread that satisfies all huger.
Mio! Mio, where are you?
here!
where?
right next you.
I can't see you!
you really scared me.
what happened? Where did you hide?
it's a new lining in the cape the weaver woman made for me.
when I put it on inside out, I become invisible.
look!
if only we could open the door.
then you can slyly pass the guards on your invisible cape.
and escape back to The Land of Faraway.
and what about you, Jum-jum?
I'll have to stay here. You have only got one invisible cape.
Yes, and only one friend.
if we have to die, we should die together.
my sword!
now I can fight Kato.
but what about the locks on the door?
how would you get pass seven times seven guards posted between here and Kato's room?
my sword will cut through the locks and my cape will hide me from the guards.
and if I never return, my very last thought would be of you and my father.
good luck, Mio. Good luck.
I heard a click.
I know that's a click.
face me, Kato! Your time is come!
you have to defeat me, Prince Mio.
strike, and make sure you in it's true.
I have known for a long time this moment would come.
but remember, prince Mio.
even if you kill me, you can not destroy evil.
another Kato would rule, and another, and another...
what can you do about it? Nothing.
let me leave.
take your faithful little friend and your white horse.
and leave this place . go home, to your father.
he's waiting for you. Go home before it is too late.
Oh! No! I came here to destroy you. And I will!
and even if you kill me, another prince will come. And another, and another.
then you must die.
at last, I am free of this heart of stone.
it has crushed and smothered me so long.
the spell had been broken. They were all down there.
but there won't birds anymore. They were free.
the weaver woman's daughter,
Nonno's two brothers,
Jiri's little sister.
and all the other children Kato had taken away.
what did I say?
the time has come for Kato's last fight.
that's what I said, and I was right.
wasn't I, Prince Mio?
look, look!
it was growing! It was growing in the Dead Forest. That's where I found it.
I knew you would succeed.
father.
Mio.
Mio, my Mio.
it's a while now since I first came to The Land of Faraway.
and I wonder what Aunt Edna and Uncle Sixten said when I never came home.
they cared so little about me.
I doubted if they even noticed that I have gone.
aunt Edna probably thinks that I'm still sitting on a park bench.
but she is wrong.
she won't find me there.
because I am here, in The Land of Faraway.
together with my father.
who my love so much and who loves me so much .
that's how it is.
Bo Vilhelm Olsson is in The Land of Faraway.
and he's very, very happy with his father, the king.

flying through the garden, Garden of the roses.
and the silver poplars I can see a bird.
it is the bird of sorrow.
I hear the bird of sorrow.
singing of the long lost Land of faraway.
and my heart is trembling, Then I hear my father say,
Mio, my Mio.
high above the garden, Garden of the roses
I can see a big bird Making for the sky.
it is the bird of sorrow.
singing about tomorrow.
I must leave the garden, I must go away.
and my heart is trembling, Then I hear my father say,
Mio, my Mio.
we need some more over here!
look out, here's Your Majesty. She can smell it when you're not working.
you there! Is the machine mended? - Yeah.
then use it, for there's many to take your place.
the child is ill. Send her home. - I can't afford to.
the child cannot work.
is there another child at home?
if you can get her here within the hour, you can keep the place.
thank you.
in the hour, mind, or lose it.
whatever you think best, Mother.
you know how this mill works almost better than I do.
(MARGARET） You ask me what I miss most about the countryside.
well, Edith, in Milton you cannot feel the seasons change around you but I do think that at long last we have put winter behind us and I can resume my daily walks.
I don't know why you're blaming me. - Play your tricks. If you're wrong, we all suffer.
they wanted 5%. Would you have given it them? - No, but I would have told them straight.
I wouldn't tell them to come back on payday so I could turn them down flat and provoke them.
are you accusing me of encouraging a strike? - Wouldn't it have suited you?
it's our livelihood you're playing with.
you would handle your workers better? - I wouldn't deliberately deceive them. Good day.
here is the address of our doctor.
you did not need to visit in person. You could have sent a servant.
you've been in this heathen climate for some time. I'm surprised you haven't needed a doctor.
we don't. I came here personally because I didn't want to alarm my father.
it's just a precaution, in case.
my mother has low spirits.
Really? We don't have much of that up here.
but Dr Donaldson will try to help if he can.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
you do not disturb me.
but even you, not remotely interested in industry, might know that there is talk of a strike.
not just here, but one that will affect the whole of Milton.
what would they gain by striking?
they'll be wanting higher wages?
that is what they will say.
but the truth is...
that there are some men raise themselves to be masters, while others will always seek to pull them down.
that is the way of the world, Miss Hale, and there is nothing you and I can do about it.
(WOMAN） I need three over here!
Hello, Miss Margaret! Been visiting the old dragon?
Hello, Jenny. How's your mother? - Little better, miss.
do you like working here? - Like it? Like work?
it's the same as anywhere. Well, it's better than Hamper's. You can only earn four shillings there.
I earn five and ten up here but my dad makes me give him most of it.
what would you spend it on, if you could?
food, and then more food. A pile of it, great big plates.
so, would you join a strike?
well, I'm not saying there will be one. Just if there was.
your mother has kindly given me the name of a doctor.
you're ill? - No. No, it's just a precaution.
your mother is always accusing me of knowing nothing about Milton.
doubt she meant you should hang on to their tittle... tattle.
they weren't telling me any secrets.
there was a man with a survey here. It's the new thing.
they become practised at telling others their working conditions.
do you mind that, if they tell the truth? - Of course not.
I don't apologize to anyone about the wages I pay or how I run Marlborough Mills.
it's in plain sight for all to see.
what about how they spend their money?
that would be none of my business.
my duty is to the running of the mill. If I neglect that, all the workers will cease to have an income.
but what about your moral duty?
if she keeps to her hours and does nothing to disrupt the efficient working of the mill, what she does in her own time's not my concern.
here in the North, we value our independence.
but surely you must take an interest?
I'm her employer. I'm not her father or her brother that I can command her to do as I please.
sorry to disappoint you, Miss Hale.
I would like to play the overbearing master but I'll answer your questions as honestly as I'm sure you ask them.
now, if you'll excuse me, I've urgent business.
all the time there she is, looking down on us like a great black angry crow guarding the nest.
as if I would ever consider her son as a suitor!
don't say you haven't thought about it.
mind you, you'd have to get some smarter clothes.
thank you! I'll have you know these were new last year!
not a chance. There's loads of girls after him.
they're welcome to him, with my good wishes.
I can say this. If I ever have a son. I'll not hang on to him like she does.
well, I'll never be having children of any sort, so that won't be a problem.
bessy, is it really so bad?
fluff on me lungs. Won't go away, however much I cough.
at least I won't grow too old and ugly! There is that.
and this happened at Marlborough Mills? - No. No.
must've happened when I were little. We didn't know of these things then. We all had to work.
when Father found out, he moved me straightaway to Thornton's.
he loves you very much, doesn't he? - Yes.
fathers and daughters. Mothers and sons.
so maybe we shouldn't be too hard on old battleaxe Thornton!
maybe your mother would be just the same if she had a son.
she does... have a son.
I have a brother.
why didn't you ever say so before? - Because we don't talk about him.
come on, I could do with a good story.
but he was desperate to go to sea and Father thought it would be the making of him.
he left full of hope...
but that was before he sailed with the Captain.
he was a monster.
once they set sail, he did whatever he liked. He beat the children to within an inch of their lives.
couldn't they do anything? - They tried.
Frederick and the others stood up to him. Some wanted to kill him.
eventually they put the Captain and a few of his officers in a boat and let it loose on the open sea.
the Navy called it a mutiny.
but Frederick really had no choice.
he was branded the "ringleader" and called a "traitor."
(MARGARET） Eventually the Navy printed a list of the mutineers and Fred's name was among them.
it nearly killed my parents.
he was in South America for a few years.
now he lives in Spain, in Cadiz.
Spain! How romantic!
sometimes I think I'll never see him again.
but if it could be told how he were put upon, how he defended others against that mad man, surely the law would spare him.
some of the sailors were caught. They pleaded their case. Captain Reid was clearly insane.
but they were hanged anyway.
no, Frederick's safe in Spain.
but if he comes home he'll be condemned to death, I'm sure.
I suppose you can take comfort that he was so brave and acted to spare those sailors weaker than himself.
Yes, I do.
but I confess that sometimes I wish he'd been more of a coward if it meant my mother might see him once more.
preparations already?
if we're going to entertain, we must do it properly.
you're not regretting the invitations, are you?
no, no. Spend what you will.
though it may have to be the last dinner party we have for some time.
so, who's on the list?
Slicksons of course. Fosters. Browns will decline, but we must invite them all the same.
hales will come, I presume?
they are probably aware of the great advantage it would be to Mr. Hale to be introduced to people.
that would not influence them.
how you seem to understand these Hales, John!
are they so different from any other people we meet?
he seems a worthy kind of man.
rather too simple for trade.
she's a bit of a fine lady, with all her low spirits!
as for the daughter, she gives herself airs.
yet they're not rich and they never have been.
she's not accomplished. She can't play the piano.
what else does she lack to bring her up to your standard?
I heard Miss Hale say she could not play myself, John.
if you would let us alone we might perhaps see her merits and like her.
I'm sure I never could.
I wish you would try to like Miss Hale, Mother.
Why?
you've not formed an attachment to her, have you?
mind you, she'll never have you.
why, she once laughed in my face at the thought of it! I'm sure she did.
she would never have me.
she has too good an opinion of herself to take you.
I should like to know, will she find anyone better?
you can both believe me, then, when I say this out of complete indifference to Miss Hale.
Mr. Hale is my friend. She is his only daughter. I wish you'd both make an effort to befriend her.
I only wish I knew why you talked about her so much. I'm tired of it.
what would you like us to talk about? How about a strike for a more pleasant topic?
(MAN） Now, now listen!
the men up at Hamper's have been told not to expect a rise!
what about Slickson's? - Thornton will tell us Friday!
so, what do you reckon? - Strike!
I thought so.
now is the time. We will all stop our machines at the end of the day Friday, 10 minutes before time!
and no one, no one will start them up!
what if Slick son decides to offer, do anything to keep his mill working at advantage of others?
then you still come out.
remember, if we all refuse to work, we are the strong ones!
how long d'you think the masters will last out? - A week, two weeks at most.
what if they send in for hands from Ireland?
thornton will. He'd die before being dictated to. - I'll take him down!
and any Irishman who takes our wages!
listen! No!
no violence!
masters expect us to behave like animals.
we will show them we are thinking men.
we will not be out... thought.
the only enemy of the strike is ourselves!
now, we must manage this strike well!
not like five years ago, when half of us went back to work before the others.
(MEN） Aye.
is that understood? - Aye.
this is it. We keep together. Friday evening it is!
(MEN） Friday!
are the hands about to turn out?
they're waiting for me to turn down their demands.
are there many orders in hand?
of course. We know that well enough.
the Americans are flooding the market.
our only chance is producing at a lower price and faster.
but the faster we fill the orders, the longer it takes to be paid.
how much are we owed?
the debt to the bank is nearly ￡400.
the men are less patient.
they've barely made up pay since their last cut.
why don't they listen?
they think that just by putting their ignorant heads together they'll get their way.
don't worry, Mother. It's a young industry. These problems will iron themselves out.
we're not yet in the position of selling up.
can't you get men from Ireland? Then you can get rid of the strikers.
I would. I'd teach them I was master and could employ who I like.
Yes, I can. And I will too, if the strike lasts.
it'll be trouble and expense but I will do it rather than give in.
if there is to be this extra expense,
I'm sorry we're giving the dinner this year.
we should go on as before.
no more, no less.
there, now, Mother. Surely one of these will do for the Thornton's...
excuse me. - Ah, and this is Margaret, of course.
the last time I saw you, you were eight, running round Helstone with your brother.
Mr. Bell! Of course!
how do you do?
I thought that she would grow into a handsome young woman, but this goddess I never imagined.
Margaret will not understand your humor.
no offence, my dear. - Of course not.
I am pleased you've come to visit at last.
with this talk of strikes, I thought I'd check with my banker whether I should sell up my property.
surely not. We're not even certain there'll be a strike, are we, Father?
I don't know. Seems to me that masters and workers will never see eye to eye.
in my teaching capacity, I meet many a working man.
they have some dreadful tales and speak from the heart and have arguments for the strike which appear entirely logical.
you know, they suffered a pay cut five years ago and have never got back to those wages.
no, though the price of food goes up all the time.
but then our friend Thornton comes to read and he answers my questions and puts the other side so eloquently...
I truly don't know what to think.
I'm sure Mr. Thornton does put his own view very eloquently.
I'm surprised the Thornton's are having a dinner, with trouble looming.
the Thornton's have a dinner on exactly the same date every year.
time nor tide stops for Mrs. Thornton's dinners.
she does not turn back for any man. - Now, that is very true!
Margaret's made friends amongst the workers. - Really?
extraordinary girl.
they've said no? - We were expecting it.
when you were asking what color would suit the baby best.
I do so long to see him.
I'm sure he'll look splendid in whatever you choose.
I've been very busy.
it's strange, for the rest of Milton is not at work.
the mills have been dark for some weeks and the streets are strangely quiet.
people try to scrape what living they can.
but all around there is desperation.
both workers and masters are holding fast to their positions. Neither will give way.
no one can say how long the strike will last.
(MAN） No! My wife! No!
she can't stand the sight of her little 'uns starving.
she'll be dead before we get our five per cent!
I hate you! You and the whole pack of the union!
said it'd take two weeks.
two weeks, you said.
it's been twice as long as that and my little 'uns are lying in their beds too hungry to cry.
don't.
now, I told you I would take care of you...
and I pledge my heart and soul that we will win.
you expect a man to watch his children starve 'ere he dare go against the union.
you've no more pity for a man than a pack of hungry wolves.
(MARGARET） We do what little we can.
I feel guilty that we do not go hungry, and helpless in the face of so much suffering.
she's a bit down in the mouth today. The strike's been going on too long.
do you blame me?
what about the Boucher's? - I left a basket outside the door.
he's got less spirit than Father and more mouths to feed.
the master'll try anything to get them back. How are you gonna stop 'em going to work?
we'll be persuasive.
where I come from in the South if the field labourers strike, the seed would not be sown and there'd be no harvest.
so? - What would become of the farms?
the farmers would have to give them up or maybe they could pay a fair wage!
suppose they couldn't, even if they wished to?
then they'd have no corn to sell and no wages to pay the next year.
I don't know about the South! I've heard there are a lot of inspirited, downtrodden men.
I'm sure I'm very ignorant. But surely not all the masters would withhold pay with no reason.
you're a foreigner. You know nothing.
to hell with Thornton's, Slickson's, Hamper's.
to hell with the lot of them.
is Mr. Thornton really as bad as the rest? - He's a fighter, fierce as a bulldog.
he's better... looking, surely, than a bulldog?
he'll stick to his word like a dog.
he's worth fighting with. That's the best I'll say for him.
I'll not argue with you, miss.
see you later, lass.
he doesn't mean to shout. They're all nerves at the minute.
Where's he going? - Golden Dragon.
he has a pint pot to... calm himself sometimes.
he talks so certain, but he's worried about keeping the strike together.
there's a lot of men, and not all of them have the same discipline as Father.
Ah, Mrs. Thornton!
I hope it is silent enough for you tonight, Mr. Hale.
the men have been gracious enough to turn out for the last month so all is quiet for our dinner party.
I'm sorry that your mother is ill.
it's nothing serious, I'm sure. She is just a little tired.
I wonder if she might like to try the water mattress.
it's the very latest thing, a mattress that fills with water.
gives great comfort to the back.
have you been ill, Miss Thornton? - Oh, no, no. I am very delicate.
I send off for the latest inventions, just in case.
mother doesn't approve.
(MAN） Ah, Thornton, good evening.
Slickson, good evening. Henderson. Watson.
Thornton. I took the liberty of inviting myself, knowing your mother's hospitality.
I hope you're not worrying about Marlborough Mills. We'll ride out the strike as we always have.
I've always had faith in you, but this situation... - It's nothing I can't handle.
no, of course not. Thornton knows everything in matters of business. He has my every confidence.
Thornton, you know Miss Latimer?
Thornton, who's that fine young lady?
see, I am learning Milton ways, Mr. Thornton.
I am sorry your mother was unable to join us.
Thornton, I must speak with you.
excuse me.
have you left word at the barracks? - It's been done.
men on horseback, armed? - All those arrangements have been made.
if they find out you are planning to break the strike...
I take this risk for myself. You need not join in.
I can and will protect myself and anyone that works for me from any kind of violence.
I sincerely hope so.
thornton is most ungallant this evening, leaving the most glorious woman in the room to talk to that slimy eel Slickson.
now, then, who can we introduce you to? Come with me.
I hear Arnold is moving, lock, stock and barrel, to America.
America? I'll be damned.
that's what I'd like to do, pack up and leave. The damn strikers'd have no work at all then.
they have no work at the moment.
there is work. They choose not to do it.
Thornton? What do you think?
I think our Mr. Bell is up to his old tricks, playing with words at the expense of us simpler fellows.
but it's a serious question.
I don't want to manufacture in another country but it's logical for others to try if they cannot make a profit here.
what do you think, Miss Hale? Surely you don't condone the strikers.
well, no. And yes. It is surely good to try to see both sides of a question.
Mrs. Arthur saw you taking a basket to the Princeton district the other afternoon.
I have a good friend in Princeton. Her name is Bessy Higgins.
Higgins? Isn't he one of your union leaders, Hamper?
Yeah. He's a terrific firebrand. A dangerous man.
I'm surprised, Miss Hale, you keep such company.
Bessy is my friend. Nicholas is a little... - Nicholas? She's on first... name terms?
well, Mr. Higgins has been made a little wild by circumstances.
but he speaks from his heart, I'm sure.
if he's so determined, I'm surprised he'll accept charity.
well, he doesn't for himself. The basket was for a man whose six children are starving.
Ah, well. Then he knows what to do. Go back to work.
I believe this poor starving fellow works at Marlborough Mills, doesn't he, Margaret?
you do the man, whoever he is, more harm than good with your basket.
you could say the longer you support the strikers, the more you prolong the strike.
that is not kindness.
they will be defeated but it will take longer. Their pain will be prolonged.
but surely to give a dying baby food is not just a question of logic?
Mrs. Thornton, I really must congratulate you on these magnificent...
um, table settings.
I don't believe I've seen finer table decorations even in the grandest gatherings in Harley Street.
not all masters are the same, Mr. Bell.
you do us an injustice to always think we're all up to some underhand scheme or other.
do come in. Maria may still be up.
Margaret?
who was that, Dixon?
who? - The man I saw leaving the house.
what man? - Dixon.
it was the doctor. Dr. Donaldson.
mother? - He was making his usual visit.
his usual visit? How long has he been coming here?
Margaret...!
why are you hiding over there?
Oh, now, now! What's this?
Dixon told you, didn't she?
she promised she wouldn't. - I made her.
it was Dixon who said that you shouldn't be told.
what does Dixon know?
she's a servant. I'm your daughter!
Shh. I don't want your father to hear.
don't be angry with Dixon.
she loves me.
no. I'll try not to.
I keep thinking about Helstone.
I used to complain about it sometimes and want to leave.
and now I'll never see it again.
that's my punishment.
and, Margaret...
I can't stop thinking about Frederick.
I'll never see him again either!
Oh, Margaret, it's so hard!
there, there, now. Shh, shh.
dear, dear, dear!
there, now, miss. You would know! Now you'll fret before you need to.
likely tell the master too. Then I'll have the whole house to deal with.
no, I won't tell Father.
I can bear it better than him. - So I see!
I've known for some time now how ill she is.
and, though I don't pretend to love her as you do,
I've loved her better than anyone else in the whole world.
I'll never forget the first time I saw her.
the young Miss Beresford.
I broke a needle into my finger, I was so nervous...
and she bound my hand with her own handkerchief.
and then...
when she returned from the ball...
she remembered to look in on me.
she changed the handkerchief for another one.
she was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen or seen since.
now, miss, you'd best get to bed!
you're gonna need a clear mind in the morning.
I'm sorry I get cross with you, Dixon.
Oh, bless you. I like a bit of spirit!
when you're all fired up, you remind me of Master Frederick.
that is a welcome sight.
you'll take us to the factory in the morning, sir?
that's the lot for tonight. We can't risk bringing any more in before daylight.
(IRISHMAN） Come on, O'Neil! Keep up, now!
Oh, it's you, miss.
did you see anyone in the street? - No. That's very odd, isn't it?
where is everyone? - I think we'll know soon enough.
best get inside the house, miss, and bolt the door behind you.
mama will be here in a moment. She asked me to apologise.
did I see faces in the mill?
my brother has imported hands from Ireland. They're huddled up in the top room.
what are they doing there? - They're frightened.
the strikers have frightened them so that they don't dare work and we don't dare let them out.
mama is seeing to their food and John is trying to calm them down.
some of the women are wailing and begging to go back home.
Ah, here's Mama.
excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you at such a time.
my mother... Fanny mentioned you had a water mattress that we might borrow?
I am sorry, I thought...
(MAN） Thornton!
Thornton!
push it down!
they're coming! They're coming! They'll kill us all!
keep her here at the back of the house. - How soon can the soldiers be here?
try to stop her panicking. - Miss Hale!
miss Hale, I am sorry you have visited us at this unfortunate moment.
they're in there somewhere! Go on!
go on, lads! We'll find 'em!
(WOMAN） It's not right! I've a family to feed!
get the Irish out!
Oh, my God! They're going for the mill door!
get the Irish out!
Oh, no! It's Boucher!
let 'em yell. Keep up your courage for a few minutes longer.
I'm not afraid. Can't you pacify them? - The soldiers will make them see reason.
reason? What kind of reason?
go down this instant and face them like a man. Speak to them as if they were human beings.
they're driven mad with hunger. Their children are starving. They don't know what they're doing.
go and save your innocent Irishmen.
Mr. Thornton, take care!
in God's name, stop! Think of what you're doing! He is only one man and you are many!
go home. The soldiers are coming.
go in peace. You shall have an answer to your complaints.
will you send the Irish home? - Never!
go inside! - They will not hurt a woman.
go inside or I will take you in!
are you satisfied?
kill me if that's what you want!
is she dead? - No, she's breathing but she looks very bad.
where is Mother? We need a doctor.
she had to get through the rioters. She were the only one of us brave enough to go.
did you see? - What?
miss Hale. What happened down below.
did you see Miss Hale clinging to the master? - No.
did all the servants see? - We had a good view from top window.
mama's sure she's set her mind on John. This proves it.
Oh, quick, Jane! Fetch some water!
there, there... Miss Hale! You lie quietly.
mother's gone for the doctor. He will be here soon!
I don't need a doctor. I must go home.
no, you can't! Mother, thank goodness you're back! Miss Hale...
is she worse? - No, I'm quite well. I want to go home.
mm, looks worse than it is.
but you've had quite a blow, young lady.
you'd better rest here a while. - No, you know my mother is unwell.
she must not be alarmed. If she hears of this... I will go now.
surely not, doctor? - I think she must be allowed to do as she will.
I'll take her with me in the carriage, see she reaches home safely.
the streets are still very noisy.
very well.
this way!
Mr. Thornton?
don't worry, sir. We'll catch the ringleaders.
Thornton's come up smiling again. Those hoodlums have broken the strike.
didn't even have to use his Irishmen.
Margaret, is that you?
Yes, Mother. I... I'll be in soon.
I must wash. The streets are very dusty today.
where is Miss Hale?
she has gone home.
gone home? That is not possible.
really, John, she was quite well!
she took a terrible blow. What were you thinking of?
everything was done properly.
Dr. Donaldson was called. I went for him myself as no one else seemed to have a mind to go.
thank you. The streets were dangerous. You...
I'm sure it's not possible to keep a headstrong young woman anywhere she doesn't care to be.
she's such a reckless young woman.
Jane, have you nothing to be getting on with? - Miss Fanny, sir...
I was so scared! I almost fainted! I thought they would break down the door and murder us all!
(MRS THORNTON） Fanny, don't be so ridiculous. - You were in no danger.
where are you going?
to see if Miss Hale is well.
I sent her home in a carriage with Dr. Donaldson. Everything was done properly. John!
I'm asking you not to go.
I hear there's been... some violence up at Marlborough Mills.
I do hope there's not too much damage.
there's a young lady wants Miss Margaret.
I told her to go but she's very distressed. Said her name's Mary.
I'm sorry, miss! I didn't know what to do! Bessy's been took so very ill!
still up?
I thought you'd be exhausted. - Why should I be?
where have you been?
just walking.
where have you been walking?
I promised you I would not go there and I did not.
But?
but...
you know I will have to go there tomorrow and you know what I will have to say.
Yes.
you could hardly do otherwise.
what do you mean?
I mean that you are bound in honour as she has shown her feelings for all the world to see.
her feelings? - She rushed out in front of them and saved you.
or are you telling me I imagined that?
you think none of the servants saw it?
do you think it's not become the tittle... tattle of Milton?
she did save me.
but, Mother, I daren't believe such a woman could care for me.
don't be so foolish.
what more proof do you need, that she should act in such a shameless way?
I'm sure she will take you from me.
that is why I didn't want you to go to see her today.
I wanted one last evening of being the first in your affections.
I will have to change the initials on our linen.
they will bear her name now, hers and yours.
I know she does not care for me.
but I can't remain silent. I must ask her.
don't be afraid, John.
she has admitted it to the world.
I may yet even learn to like her for it.
it must have taken a great deal to overcome her pride.
(EDITH） Dear Margaret, if only uncle would bring you all home you wouldn't need to witness such suffering.
as for feeling guilty, Margaret, surely you can have nothing to reproach yourself for.
after all, the workers chose to go on strike and I am sure you've done your best to help.
even when we were little girls you always did the right thing.
I had not noticed the colour of this fruit.
I'm afraid I was very ungrateful yesterday.
you have nothing to be grateful for. - I think that I do.
I did only the least that anyone would have. - That can't be true.
I was, after all, responsible for placing you in danger.
I would have done the same for any man there.
any man? So you approve of that violence? You think I got what I deserved?
no, of course not! But they were desperate. I know if you were to talk to them...
I forgot. You imagine them to be your friends.
but if you were to be reasonable... - Me? Are you saying that I'm unreasonable?
if you would talk with them and not set the soldiers on them, I know they would...
they will get what they deserve.
miss Hale, I didn't just come here to thank you.
I came because...
I think it very likely... I know I've never found myself in this position before.
it's difficult to find the words.
miss Hale, my feelings for you are very strong.
please, stop.
please don't go any further.
excuse me?
please don't continue in that way. It's not the way of a gentleman.
I'm well aware that in your eyes at least I'm not a gentleman.
but I think I deserve to know why I am offensive.
you speak to me as if it were your duty to rescue my reputation!
I spoke to you about my feelings because I love you. I have no thought for your reputation.
you think that because you are rich and my father is in reduced circumstances that you can have me for your possession?
I should expect no less from someone in trade! - I wish to marry you because I love you!
you shouldn't, because I do not like you and never have.
one minute we talk of the colour of fruit...
the next of love.
how does that happen?
my friend Bessy Higgins is dying.
and that, of course, is my fault, too?
I'm sorry. - For what?
that you find my feelings for you offensive?
or that you assume I'm only capable of thinking in terms of buying and selling?
or enjoy sending my employees to an early grave?
No! No, of course not.
I... I'm sorry to be so blunt.
I have not learnt how to... how to refuse.
how to respond when a man talks to me as you just have.
there are others?
this happens to you every day?
you must have to disappoint so many men that offer you their heart.
please understand, Mr. Thornton... - I do understand.
I understand you completely.
everyone in the back, into the kitchen. - Excuse me?
let's go, move! - Ok, all right.
Mr. Gazi, I was just about to call you.
I talked to Raman, he said I have more time. That's not what he told me.
wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on, no! Wait! No!
C'mon, don't do this. Please.
calm down, just... You don't have to do this, all right?
I can get you the money. Just give me one more day.
good run? - Jesus!
you scared the hell out of me.
you have any idea how easy it is to get in here?
you should try locking your door for starters. Yeah, yeah.
what's going on? Rebecca called an early briefing.
you weren't picking up so... I decided to come by.
you thinking about putting some furniture in this place?
I got the important stuff. How long have you been here, four months?
six and a half. - Six and a half months?
and you have one plant, and you killed it.
look at that. Look, it's a metaphor.
just because you're divorced doesn't mean you have to live like a slob.
separated. All right? There's a big difference.
all right. I'm just saying, John.
this isn't a home, it's depressing.
does Emily stay here? Where... where does she sleep?
alright. That's enough, okay. I'm going to have a shower.
make yourself some coffee, if you want. - All right.
Hey, look at this. - Who's that?
he's been cracking her up for the last twenty minutes.
you have any idea who that guy is? None.
...they're pointed at you, so...
all I remember is you were a sloppy drunk.
I was an exceptional drunk. - Oh. Okay, I remember it.
that you... uh, I remember shots of tequila lined up.
I remember, correct me if I'm wrong, lime green underwear.
more of a minty green. - Oh, I see.
I do remember you drinking me under the table, though.
what's this, an early briefing?
John, there you are, good.
this is Marcus Jakes, he's a U. C. - Right.
Hey. John Moreland, in the flesh.
the stories I hear about you, brother. - How you doing?
Jakes and I were in uniform together. Same division.
small world.
I used to make her laugh so hard that coffee would shoot out her nose.
she still do that?
all the time. - Okay. So. Briefing.
right. - Yeah.
ali Raman, runs a protection racket.
illegal gambling, torture, murder.
he's got an underground fight club, it's pretty intense.
Yeah, I've heard of this guy, he's a borderline psychopath.
Jakes has been deep undercover.
eight months. - Cool.
my path into Raman's operation has been through his lieutenant. A guy named Ric Gazi.
Oh. Look at that. - It's magic.
OK, I'm in deep with Gazi... Worked my way onto his crew.
and you've been doing what?
you know, collections. Trashing stores, intimidating folks, that kind of thing.
I could arrest Gazi right now, but he is not my focus.
I want this guy. I want Raman, I want the boss.
major Crimes is asking us to help out. - Why, where's your handler?
the handler was Stu Crowder, he's out of the picture.
out of the picture, what does that suppose to mean?
what happened to him? Uh, whiskey...
...happened to him. Followed by gin, followed by paint thinner, if that's what he had around. After a while he just stopped checking in.
I'd called for surveillance, and backup, I get nothing.
I was completely on my own.
so, what can we do for you, Mr. Jakes?
my boy Gazi, he's got ambitions.
he's wants to take out Raman. He's planning a hit.
we can't let that happen.
so we're going to get in front of it. - Mh-hmm...
you are going to be my old friend John the hit-man.
I'm going to introduce you to Gazi.
you're gonna meet him, you're gonna talk to him, you're gonna take the contract.
and then we pick him up. - Conspiracy to murder, that's big.
Yeah, I need him out of the way. I need a clear shot at his boss.
I want Raman in prison, not dead.
alright, listen up. Our first step... Just wait a second.
how do you know about this hit he's got planned? - He told me.
so you didn't offer?
no, of course not.
what's your point?
my point is, is just I want to know what I'm walking myself into here.
make sure this meet is clean.
relax. I know what I'm doing. The job is solid.
Jesse, you'll cover things from the inside, you'll be a fighter, training at Raman's club.
you'll be our eyes in there.
I'm going to have to wire you.
with what you're wearing, I'm gonna have to do your chest.
can you take your shirt off? - Yeah.
are you kidding me?
what?
nothing.
come here.
Gazi will be at the club, that's where he does business.
Jakes, you're gonna walk John inside, introduce him. We'll be recording everything.
as soon as Gazi offers John the contract, we got him.
alright, they just came in.
Jesse, make sure you keep them in sight. - Copy that.
on the face of it is completely legit, but after hours it's a whole different thing.
the gloves come off, bare knuckle fights. A lot of gambling, a lot of blood.
they never get shut down? - No, never.
raman knows exactly who to pay off, and exactly how much.
the guy in there right now, the guy behind me, green shirt, that's the trainer Duffy, Eli Duff. He runs all the fighters.
every single one of them does double duty as enforcers. The kid in there with him, that's Gavin.
if you don't pay your debt, he comes by, he breaks your arms.
OK.
so, over there. That's my guy Gazi,
Raman's second in command.
he wants Raman gone so he can take over the whole operation.
he's a little paranoid, so don't take it personally.
well, he's planning to kill his boss, I'd be paranoid too.
they're approaching Gazi. - There he is.
what... whoa, wait, wait, wait for it, wait.
chewy says he's sorry, won't be late again.
don't say I never gave you nothing.
Oh, this is my friend. This is the guy.
the guy I told you about. - How you doing? John.
he does the thing, the service.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
what did I tell you? He hates new people, this guy.
Gazi, we had the conversation, you wanted to meet a guy, now you're meeting him.
what's happening? - I don't know. Looks like a standoff.
you're imagining things, my friend. You need to walk away right now.
I told him this was a bad idea.
he's got zero judgment, this guy. - What are you talking about?
you think he's going to discuss business in front of all these people? Come on.
apologize. Come on, let's go.
you're killing me here, you know that?
tell him we're gonna meet somewhere else. Brickworks, north side.
Yes. - In the parking lot.
alright that'll work, that's good. I'll ask him.
Brickworks, north side, parking lot.
be there in twenty minutes, your last chance.
alright, they're on their way out.
when we're going to wait here in the car. Let Gazi come to us.
when he comes in, let him drive the conversation.
don't lead him, alright? - All right.
Maria and Danny are going to be at 2 o'clock running spin.
what's he thinking with these tinted windows, how are we going to see Gazi when he's in the backseat?
Rebecca will be in the lot behind us. She'll have eyes on the entrance.
here's Rebecca.
OK, she's in position.
it's good to see Rebecca, she looks good.
you two getting along? - Most of the time.
Yeah, she takes a while that one.
you two will be fine.
she's worth it. She's one of a kind, seriously.
the best cop I've ever known.
John, Gazi's approaching the entrance.
get ready.
we got eyes.
OK, here he is. We're good, Gazi's alone.
John, do you have a clear view? - Yeah, we're good.
what is he doing? - Is he gonna get out?
relax. He's just being cautious.
come on, Gazi.
alright, here we go.
shots fired, Rebecca. - Where's... where's the shooter?
there he is, by the warehouse. - Daniel, stay with him.
I got him. I got him, he's headed south. We're in pursuit.
shots fired. Brickworks, north side parking lot, send an ambulance.
alright, hold on.
all I'm saying is this whole thing is based on Jakes' information.
Jakes' judgment, all right?
if he was doing his job, he would have known about the hit.
but you're not placing blame. - No I'm not placing blame.
Rebecca, wait, okay?
I've worked with guys like this before, all right?
if Gazi was exposed... he should have been on top of that...
he didn't know it was going to happen, John. You would have made the same call.
I know this guy's a friend of yours, all right, but maybe you've got a blind spot for this guy. Do you ever think of that?
he's a good cop, you need to back off.
Ric Gazi was DOA at Mount Sinai.
homicide wants you to call.
I'm sure they do.
you're gonna have to give a full statement. We all are.
shooter? - He got away.
I had no idea guys, I swear to God.
so, what happened. Raman caught wind of the hit?
found out his boy's coming after him, got there first?
Yeah, must have been. - Could have been a pre-emptive strike.
it means you might be done, Jakes. Too bad. That's eight months work down the drain.
or maybe it works in my favor.
it's an opportunity, maybe it's a chance to move up.
how do you figure that?
you're one of Gazi's boys, Raman's going to smell you a mile away.
all I gotta do is make a move, guys.
I just gotta send a message. Show Raman that I'm loyal, that I wasn't involved.
John could be right. You could be next in line for a bullet.
and if my guys are with you, they're in danger too.
we need to make sure Jakes is safe. That's our next move.
we could put Jesse in as a fighter slash enforcer, maybe?
he's already been in the club. He's established.
Yeah, he could be looking for extra cash. Jakes, you can walk him in, make the intro.
he could be one of your boys. It'll give us a sense.
if anyone looks at you sideways, Jakes, that's it, we're out.
copy that. Kid, I hope you know how to fight.
raw talent, quick learner.
you need a guy to do collections, he can do that too.
you said you were looking for new people. How you doing?
Where'd you find him? - This girl I know, he's her kid brother.
she's insane, she thinks he's the next big thing.
maybe she's right.
Yeah, listen kid, this is Duffy, you do exactly what he says, all right?
Yeah.
throw him in there with Gavin, see what he does.
first spar doesn't go to one of my boys.
it goes to me.
good luck, kid.
alright, here we go.
take it easy on him, Duff.
come on, Jesse, here we go, make this count.
keep it together. Let's go, let's go.
watch his feet, c'mon.
that's it, that's it, wait for an opening.
that's alright, you got this, c'mon!
shake it off.
come on, stay on him. Let's go, let's go.
alright, Duffy, I think you made your point.
alright, you can let him up I think. He can't breathe.
let him up, man. What are you doing?
your boy's okay. Tell him to come see me later.
you made the right choice, by the way.
you had a front cross. You saw it, but you didn't take it.
you let Duffy smoke you. - You noticed?
I did the same thing, my first time.
you're gonna do just fine here.
come on.
What'd I tell you? I'm safe, we're good to go.
what have you got? - All right. Bear with me.
raman is in the business, among other things, of collecting debts, right?
and sometimes he buys a debt from someone else.
for example, you're a gambler. You're Gambler Dan.
and you owe John here, two-fifty, three hundred grand. You're not paying.
and Gentleman John here is an old friend of mine from way back, you know, he's not a violent man.
he can't go around breaking people's fingers, he doesn't have the stomach for it.
so I bring Raman the debt, and he buys it for, say, I don't know, 50 grand.
he's like a collection agent.
now Gambler Dan owes him. And if he doesn't pay, his legs get broken.
but we've already established, John as a hit-man.
but no one knows that.
they only saw him in the club. So why was he in the club?
you were introducing him to Gazi. - Right.
because of the debt Gazi was going to buy. And now that Gazi's dead...
you're going to take it all the way up to Raman.
yes... This is the move I've been waiting to make.
raman goes after gambler Dan...
and just as he's about to break some fingers...
in comes the dream team. Guns a'blazin. Ready to make some arrests.
loan sharking, extortion, assault.
guys, what do you think?
it's not terrible.
thoughts?
let's do it. Let's take it for a spin.
yes?
this is John Bain.
pleasure. Please sit.
Marcus, has told me about your predicament.
I love my sister.
only she has terrible taste in men.
he's a gambler, they were together for two years.
he stole three hundred thousand from her.
and when she found out, he became very violent.
he almost killed her.
and now you want your money back.
I want him to pay.
I want your personal attention on this. I hear you're the best.
can you do it?
possibly.
I'll need time to have Gavin check him out.
whatever you need. He lives at 19 West Elm Street.
John has a special request.
go ahead.
I want to be there when you do it.
when you collect.
I want to look into his eyes, when you're making him pay.
Hey. John asked me to check into Jakes' files.
Really?
Yeah, and I think we might have a problem.
so I've been pulling all of Jakes' case work from the last eight months. And it's full of holes.
I'm not surprised, the handler was AWOL...
Yeah, I'm not so sure it's just the handler.
I mean, he's got paper, just not a lot of evidence.
there's no video, there's no audio.
his hand-written notes are sketchy at best.
there's nothing here that would stand up in court.
and there's this woman, Abi Rand.
Jakes has been using her as a CI. Former heroin addict.
her information hasn't led to a single arrest, and yet he keeps paying her.
thousands of dollars for nothing.
look, this all could have an explanation, but if Jakes is lying to us, if he's out of control...
so he's sleeping with his C. I. - Probably, yeah.
I'm going to bring her in, talk to her.
have you looked at the case work? - It's a mess.
it could be the handler. - You're going to blame the handler on this one?
I know Jakes, he would never jeopardize a case like this.
Rebecca, you knew him fifteen years ago.
if you ask me, I think you should shut down this whole thing right now.
maybe he's been in too long...
he believed in me, John.
he was the first.
he used to say, "I'd follow you anywhere.
I'd walk off a cliff for you."
I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt on this.
what's the C. I.'s name? - Abi.
alright, when she comes in, Maria should talk to her, not you.
we need to know we can trust Jakes.
until then, I'll look after things myself, all right?
I'll cover Jesse at the set-up house. Soon as Daniel checks out Raman, we move.
put Jakes' play in action, Gambler Dan.
you want to head over, take a look inside?
not yet. We're gonna sit tight. See who comes and goes.
so what happens if he won't pay? Rough him up a little?
we're just doing research, that's all.
alright, they're in place. Let's give it a few minutes.
I'm ready. Just say the word.
I'm just trying to figure this whole thing out.
so, the boss is Raman. And Gazi, he got shot, he's dead.
but then, Duffy, he's the one who gives you the orders, right?
you ask a lot of questions.
whatever, we don't have to talk.
okay, Daniel. Any time.
here he is.
sweet car.
that's a hundred grand easy, right there.
Yeah, that's him, that's our guy. No question - Are you kidding me? - What?
hang on a sec.
what's wrong? - I don't believe it.
that guy arrested me. - What?
like seven, eight years ago. That guy's a cop!
what? You're sure?
my first bust, man. I'll never forget his face.
Daniel, you just got made. - You're kidding me.
you're busted. Stay in the house, stay out of sight.
man, what are the friggin' odds?
so what are we gonna do?
what do you think we're gonna do? We're going to tell the boss.
son of a...
Ah, come on...
what are you doing?
you want to tell me where I am?
ABI, I'm Detective Constable Cortez.
am I under arrest?
are you a confidential informant for Marcus Jakes?
is this your C. I. number?
was I supposed to memorize it?
what about this, is that your signature?
Where's Marcus?
these are all payments made to you, in exchange for information. False information by the looks of it.
but he kept paying you.
are you sleeping with him, Abi?
he's not paying me for sex.
is Marcus Jakes your boyfriend? - So what if he is?
I get it, Abi. You probably thought you'd never get in trouble for this.
I mean he's a cop, right?
here's the thing, though, it's bogus information.
it won't hold up in court. You both knew it.
that's an offence.
I should arrest you, right now.
I want to talk to Marcus. - That's not happening.
I can't go to jail, okay? I can't. I can't do that.
I need to show you something. Do you know who this man is?
can you tell me his name.
that's Chip.
that's my ex. - Do you know who did this to him?
he was stalking me, he wouldn't leave me alone.
Abi. He almost died.
who did this? Who was it?
it was Marcus. Marcus did it.
chip came by my apartment and Marcus just lost it.
I thought he was gonna kill him.
what are you doing man, what are you doing here?
Hey, can I come in? - Yeah, come on in.
uh... Give me a minute.
alright. - Yeah.
nice digs. - Yeah, it does the job, right?
this place wired?
bedroom's on the fritz, but you know...
Yeah.
here you go. - Thank you.
so you had a late night last night?
what are we doing here, what's going on?
Rebecca's worried about the case.
she wants you to come in.
what else is new? She loves to worry, that girl.
that what you came by, to tell me? Could've just called.
your phone's off. - I would've got the message.
so how's Danny-boy? How's our play shaking out?
got made.
he, what? - Yup.
what did he do? - The muscle guy, Gavin.
turns out Daniel arrested him back in the day.
you're kidding me. - Nope.
that's just bad luck, that's what that is.
seems to happen a lot on this case.
let me ask you something.
if I were to go through this whole place, what kind of contraband would I find?
what are you talking about?
Jakes, I've been here. I've done all this.
okay? I know the temptations.
I must be good if I'm fooling you.
you're falling for the look, man. The props.
I'm squeaky clean. You know what, John?
I would have thought you of all people would know what I'm doing here.
I had to forget everything, but who I was.
just to be this guy.
I watch guys get beaten every day and I just gotta stand there.
you think that's fun for me?
I'm doing police work, are you going to help me or what?
we talked to Abi. We brought her in.
she told us the full extent.
she's prepared to testify.
the full extent of what? - You've been collecting debts.
you've been there when guys have gotten beaten.
and you haven't just been watching, you've been doing it yourself.
no no no, that's the cover, it's not real, she doesn't understand - Guys... - You've funneling cash to your C. I.
you've been making money and not reporting it.
that's not true. - You know me, you know what I'm like.
if it's true, I'm gonna find out.
I've been working this case for eight months.
I dream of this, why would I put that in jeopardy?
you like the lifestyle you like playing the part.
you don't want to leave it.
is that what you think, Rebecca?
is that what this guy's telling you?
I swear to God, Marcus, I don't know what to think.
okay, this guy John-boy, I've heard a lot of stories.
you don't think he bent the rules sometimes?
okay look, this guy was abusive.
he wouldn't leave her alone, I was worried for her.
the case is good.
so what they know Daniel's a cop? That's workable.
we could use that, he's not the first cop to owe a debt.
they'll never guess that's our cover. Rebecca, look at me.
come on, you know me, you know I wouldn't do this.
I know who you were.
I need it.
I need this Raman guy, he is a scumbag.
and he ruins people's lives.
I need something good to come out of all this.
don't. Don't turn me into the guy...
the cop who goes off the rails, and blows the big case.
don't do it to me.
can you give us a minute?
Yeah, yeah.
this guy Raman, he's vicious, he beats people up for a living.
he killed someone right in front of us.
we need to get him, Rebecca.
look, Jakes is on the edge, he has to be, it's what got him close to Raman.
I think Jakes can do it.
Really? After all this?
you're going to put your life in his hands?
you know as well as I do, that could be me outside that door right now.
you believed in this guy. Let's give him a chance to redeem himself.
let's take Raman down.
so the good news is, Gavin doesn't remember your name, just your face.
say hello to Daniel Winacott.
you're part of Guns and Gangs, just like the real Daniel.
and after a couple years, you blew it. Infractions, bad performance reports, caught in a few gambling dens and then down-graded to a desk job.
so, I'm a file-clerk. - With a temper.
and a gambling problem, you just can't resist a big fight.
listen, you think this is going to work?
raman deals with cops all the time, probably some of his best clients.
OK, It's fight night at Raman's club.
Daniel, you're there to bet on the fight, and Maria, you're his new girlfriend.
Jakes and John, you're gonna make contact with Raman, and deliver Gambler Dan right to him.
all Raman has to do is try and collect and we got him, we'll take him down.
yo, focus man, I need you here.
how's our boy doing? - To be honest, a bit shaky.
but he's obsessed with Raman. He'll get through it.
that Rebecca? She worried about me? - She's fine.
is that the best you can do? - Come on, tell me.
Jakes, we're wired. - I don't care about the wire.
give it to me straight, brother John. Is this my last day on the job?
this is our last chance at this case.
I mean as a cop. She's gonna take my badge, isn't she?
that's up to you. Look, we'll talk about that tomorrow.
tonight, let's just focus on getting the bad guys, all right?
Rebecca wouldn't put you in play if she didn't think you could do this.
you don't know Becks like I do.
once you lose her trust, it's over. Right, Rebecca?
well you're going to have to earn it back. Jakes, you are good at this job.
you just got to remind her that, alright?
okay? Okay?
Yeah, yeah, okay.
heads up. Here comes the target.
imagine my surprise when I discovered that the man you asked me to collect from is a cop.
he is, I should have mentioned that to you. I didn't want you to say no.
did you know about this, Marcus? Did you know?
it's my fault I didn't even tell him.
look, this cop a screw-up. He has no friends.
there will be no payback. You have my guarantee.
he's over there at the bar right now.
he's with his new girlfriend.
you brought him here.
I brought him to the fight as a peace offering.
trust me, he has absolutely no idea you're about to collect on his debt.
look, you're going to make a lot of money tonight, my friend.
and you're going to have me to thank for that.
let's do it right now, I'll call him over.
no, leave him there for a minute, he's fine.
he's enjoying himself. My problem is this.
I don't like police.
and to be perfectly honest, I'm starting to have an uneasy feeling about you, Jakes.
what are you talking about? - And I always listen to that feeling.
what's he doing?
stop, why are you killing this?
this is not happening. I'm sorry, Jakes.
not tonight. Enjoy the fight.
you and your friend.
that's it? He can't just walk away. - He can and he just did.
Rebecca, I think we're done here.
you want to give him some time, circle back?
no, there's no point. It's over. He just closed the door.
come on, are you kidding me? You're just giving up?
calm down Jakes, we're done.
so what? We're just shutting down?
let's pack it up.
here we go, boys.
no head butts, eye gouging, groin attacks, or head kicking to a grounded opponent.
alright, so that's it I guess. - Next time, right?
I'll see you back at the shop.
okay, but I'm staying for the fight.
what do you wanna do, wanna watch the fight?
it's not over.
you think you can just walk away? You think we're done?
come here!
where do you go? Where do you go?
what are you doing?
he's unarmed. He's going to tell us everything.
every crime, every detail.
or I'm going to put a bullet in him.
Hey, where's John? Have you seen him?
no, and no Jakes.
you think this is gonna work? - He's gonna confess.
he's gonna say we beat it out of him.
and then we're gonna deny it.
what do you mean "we"?
I, mean you and me. You're gonna get my back.
you want me to lie for you? - Yes.
eight months, John, I've been after this guy for eight months.
I'm not just gonna let him go. If you're not up for it, you leave.
wake up!
wake up!
alright, Jakes. Come on, don't do this.
I'm gonna back you up on this one, okay?
we'll say he came after you, it was self-defense.
you will not be charged.
but after that, Jakes, you've got to walk away from this one right now.
right now, you need to walk away.
wake up!
Maria, what's going on in there?
Jakes and John, where are they? - We left them watching the fight.
what about Raman? - He's not here either.
find them.
we gotta split up.
I've been where you are. All right?
thanks to this job... I've racked up a divorce,
I got a bleak apartment I can barely unpack,
I lie awake in my bed at night full of anger, full of this constant rage.
good for you.
Awww, there he is!
wait, Jakes, I get it, all right? Oh no, you don't get it.
this guy tortures people, and takes pleasure from doing it!
and he's gonna say it, into the phone or I'm gonna put a bullet in his brain.
talk, tell it! Tell me how you torture people!
you're right. This guy is scum.
talk! - He's an animal, he deserves it.
okay, you could kill him right now, no one would shed a tear.
let me tell you something...
if you do that, if you shoot him, you will be lost, my friend.
you are done.
you will never come back from that, ever again.
you understand me?
right now you are standing on the edge.
you need to step back now. Just one step back.
come on, I'm right here.
I'm not forcing you.
come on.
you gotta step back.
you're gonna charge him? - I'm gonna try.
Jakes. - You need to arrest me.
you need to take me in. - I'm sorry.
let's go.
this is gonna sound strange.
I'm glad it was you.
Daniel. Want to come and help me unpack?
there's a couple beer in it for you.
tempting, but I got a thing tonight. - Well, that's your loss, pal.
tell you what, save me a cold one.
nice place. You need to start locking your door, though.
everything's unpacked.
you did this all for me?
someone needed to take responsibility.
I'm gonna get you all keys, alright?
guys...
okay, tough guy. What would you do if I did this...
not bad.
it's the reflexes of a jungle cat.
is that right?
yeah... - Yeah?
I can still see that skinny kid in his uniform.
never really fit him. Didn't fit any of us.
all he wanted was to catch the bad guy.
I should've seen it.
you did. I pushed.
I let you.
you ever worry it'll happen to you?
every day.
welcome back, Dr. King. - Thank you.
you're staring at me again.
no, I'm not.
okay, I am.
you ready to talk about it now?
I can't.
you can tell me, whatever it is.
I can keep a secret.
stop staring at me. - You were staring at me first.
you want to play doctor?
I can be the doctor.
you can be the patient.
doctor-patient confidentiality.
Mm. No, no. no, I can't talk about it.
has anyone talked to Charlotte?
I left her a couple of messages, but she--she didn't call me back.
well, what do we say to her? - "get well soon" or "sorry this happened
both seem pretty ridiculous. - Is there a card that says "I'm sorry you got viciously beaten and robbed"?
you need to learn to filter before you speak.
you must have talked to her. - I sent her flowers.
Oh, flowers. Crap. I should've sent her flowers.
Hey! Oh, Charlotte went to the hospital first, but now she's parking downstairs, - so I need-- I need, uh- you need to go to the gym.
shut up. She's gonna be here... any second.
just don't act weird.
you're setting a great example. - Just tell her she looks great.
does she? - No, she looks like she got the crapped kicked out of her...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. - But if we just-- shh.
good morning. - morning.
take a good look then get over it.
if you're gonna be all nervous and annoying around me,
stay the hell outta my way.
What'd I say? I said "don't act weird,
and you all acted weird...Like weird people.
well, I thought it went about as well as could be expected.
I think it's too soon for her to be back.
well, look, I mean, she faced everybody,
clearly stated her needs, she told us off
therapeutically speaking, that's a good day's work.
Violet's right. Either you get swallowed up by that kind of trauma or you try to regain control of your life.
Charlotte's regaining control. Right?
I just got your page.
Elisa, it's gonna be okay.
all right, you're gonna feel a little pinch.
I'm in. Now I just have to drain the fluid.
thank you, Dr. Wilder. - No problem. You did great.
papi, I'm okay. Really.
she isn't, is she? Her cancer's back.
I'm sorry. I think the lymphoma tissue has seeded the pericardium.
we'll have to confirm with a C.T.
please don't worry, Papi.
her body can't take more chemo.
the last two times, she lost all her hair,
her mouth and tongue were covered in ulcers.
I can try something different to treat the side effects.
and, Diego, we've talked about this.
even after a relapse, Elisa's type of lymphoma is curable.
I believe that, but not with western medicine.
chemotherapy is the way to fight this.
there's another way.
I'm taking Elisa to a shaman.
I was thinking about getting a latte, and then, uh,
well, I thought of you, so I went to your office, but you weren't there, - And I thought I'd check downstairs... - You sound like a stalker.
I don't. Well...
okay, I kind of do. But, uh... coffee?
no, thanks.
tea then?
or, um, we could get one of those iced, uh, fruity-chino things.
we're not friends.
you need another pelvic exam to make sure you're healing properly,
not to mention follow-up labs, continued H. I.V. Drugs.
I'll take care of that myself. - Charlotte, you...
all right. We're not friends.
but we could be.
I could be your friend.
I'm the only one who knows what happened,
and I could, I don't know, be there for you or whatever.
I only need one thing from you.
anything. Name it.
keep your damn trap shut about what happened.
his daughter has been through chemo twice, and her cancer is back.
you can't blame Diego for wanting to try something else.
consulting a witch doctor instead of an oncologist borders on child abuse.
shamans have been healing people for thousands of years, Cooper.
so even if you don't believe in it, then - Elisa's mother didn't believe in it.
this would not be an issue if Alice were alive.
she would never let a medicine man try to clear the trauma in Elisa's soul
to restore the balance in her body because it's crap.
you know as well as I do that a person's faith plays a huge role in their recovery.
so if Elisa and Diego believe a shaman can help, then she can.
she is sick, Pete. She needs real help.
she does need help,
and if you want to be a part of it, open your mind.
with all my health problems,
I feel like I've robbed you of your youth.
Oh, my youth was spent just fine.
every week, we come in here, and all I can think about is, it's not fair.
I mean, first it was my diabetes.
you had that long before I met you. It doesn't count.
and then the breast cancer. - Which we beat together.
taking care of me is exhausting.
I see it in you.
and sometimes, I- I'm afraid you'll start to resent me.
Oh, that's crazy. - No, wait, nick, let's talk about that.
how do you relieve the stress that her illness puts on your marriage?
do you exercise? Do you drink?
not for years...
on either count.
you fight?
we fight. Sure. Every couple does.
that's true.
so why is it making you so uncomfortable?
she doesn't mean to, but - nick.
I'm sorry. My last patient was, uh...
I've got some more.
it's okay, honey. - I don't want to talk about it.
she doesn't mean to.
Rachel and Nick" Rachel?
she's been with him for 20 years.
I mean, people get upset in therapy.
no, this was not an emotional outburst, okay?
it was an adrenaline surge.
it... It was the kind of rage you see from an addict.
is she taking drugs? - Yes, but not the kind you think.
we're managing her diabetes and the kidney problems that causes.
but she's not a junkie.
in fact, she's the most resilient woman I know.
she never complains about her health, never stops trying.
no, no, she's incredible. - She's abusive.
Sheldon, come on. She was a ballerina,
and Nick looks like a lumberjack.
really, I mean, how badly can she really hurt him? - Abuse is abuse.
would we be having this conversation If Rachel were the one being hit instead of Nick?
Sheldon - I'm serious.
would you tell a woman to stay with an abusive spouse?
no, but this is-- okay, this feels different.
Rachel and Nick are not a cautionary tale.
they're a love story. - You ever heard of Judith and holofernes?
famous love story-- ends with Judith chopping off the head of her beloved.
you know, Florence-- great paintings by Rubens and Rembrandt?
you should see 'em.
what? - Nothing. You're just... A little odd and pretentious.
but I'm not wrong. Something's going on with Rachel.
what's wrong, Coop? - Shamans.
shamans.
and Charlotte. - Shamans and Charlotte?
no--No, no. Mostly Charlotte.
she's having nightmares. She wakes up screaming.
I try to get her to eat. She says she's not hungry.
I try to talk about the police investigation,
she just... Shuts me down.
well, she's trying to put herself back together in her own way, Coop.
I mean, there's no blueprint for any of this.- Yeah. No, I-I know that.
everyone handles trauma differently. It takes time to heal.
you gotta put one foot in front of the blah, blah, blah.
wow, I'm glad to see you hold the tools of my profession in such high regard.
well, none of that helps me, Violet. - Well, it's not about you, Cooper.
it's about Charlotte. - So you're saying...
back off. - Oh, you're a bad shrink.
can I hide out here for a while? - Yeah, as long as you want.
I have to report the abuse, Nick.
if you say anything,
I'll deny it.
she's hitting you. - Most of the time, she's fine.
and when she's not, I can handle her.
for now. But what I saw... She could hurt you.
are you married, Dr. Wallace?
no.
then with all due respect,
you can't understand.
I met her right out of journalism school.
I was a reporter for the "Tim" Times.
got tagged to cover a performance of "swan lake.
what the hell did I know about ballet, right?
but when I saw her dance,
I don't know, she was just... Mesmerizing.
she has this quality like, when you're with her,
nothing else matters.
I won't give up on her...
not ever.
who sent you to spy on me?
Cooper? Addison?
I came looking for you on my own. I figured your day was probably pretty weird,
and you might need some sugary, deep-fried batter.
so are you - If you ask me if I'm okay, I swear to god,
I'll take this cast and knock you upside the head.
I wasn't gonna ask you that.
when I first kicked drugs, I,uh, took up running.
I mean, an addict's gotta be addicted to something, right?
so I would get up when it was still dark,
and I would go for miles.
until the morning I got clipped by a minivan.
I didn't get anything like the injuries that you have,
but I started craving pills again.
so...I was thinking that maybe you were craving pills again.
I took your advice, and I'm back at meetings, - And if you wanna go - I grew up wrestling two brothers.
I have an incredibly high pain threshold.
anything else?
can-- can you hold that?
I got Nick to agree to bring Rachel in.
would you check her out? - Of course.
okay.
it's been a while since we discussed man troubles,
and... I- I was beginning to think that you found another therapist.
Oh. No, I-I... I want to talk about Charlotte.
do you think she's okay? Because I don't.
but she won't listen to me. - I didn't realize you two were close.
well, we're not exactly, but... I was there that night,
and... It was horrific.
and if it was Nai or Amelia, I'd know what to do.
but because it's Charlotte-- She's just not interested.
it's because you were there that night.
no, she wanted me there. - No, at the time, yes, but you saw her when she was in her most fragile state,
which means you're the living breathing reminder of what happened.
when she sees you, she's that victim again.
I just want to help.
well, then you'll need to find a more indirect way to do it.
thank you for allowing us to observe.
I brought something for Elisa.
the medicine men I've worked with say that quartz is a very powerful healer.
so you understand my beliefs?
I worked with a shaman in the Congo to treat an outbreak of measles.
and you think it was the shaman that cured those people, not the vaccinations?
maybe it was one thing, maybe it was both.
either way, people got better.
I know you think I'm crazy, Dr. Freedman.
but my only concern is that Elisa get well.
we tried western medicine. It failed. - It kept her alive.
it killed my wife. - Alice died of an aneurysm that ruptured.
nobody could've saved her. And Elisa-- she can still be saved.
papi, is she okay? - Elisa?
she needs help. She's getting help.
it's just the bad energy leaving her body. - I'm not getting a pulse.
leave her alone. - I'm calling an ambulance.
stop it! Let the shaman finish. - Elisa, stay with me now. Come on.
is Elisa okay? - Yes.
she was in hypotensive shock by the time the ambulance got here,
so she needed surgery to make a small incision
in the sac around the heart to drain the fluid.
she's in recovery now. - Can she come home?
she's gonna have to stay here for a few more days.
also, I'd like to keep her under observation while we start chemo.
you brought Elisa here against my wishes. I want her discharged.
no, she can't go anyplace until the surgical drain's removed.
do you understand what's happening?
she has a tube draining fluid out of her heart,
and she has a tumor that's getting larger every day, - And no shaman can stop that. - Elisa is my daughter,
and I will decide what medical treatment she
not if you're incapable of making responsible decisions.
alternative therapies work, Cooper. I've seen patients cured.
with the right combination of homeopathic remedies,
elisa can get the kind of treatment that Diego wants.
enough. I'm sorry. I don't care what Diego wants.
I'm getting a judge to order Elisa's chemo.- No, you-- you can't do that.
Yes, I can, and I will.
Sam, I have to tell you something. - Now?
do you wanna know my secret or do you want to have sex with me?
well, both would-- both would be good.
I did something the other night...
a rape kit.
okay, we really need to work on your pillow talk.
well, technically, it was just some washings,
but see the thing is, is that the victim didn't want it.
wait. What? - She was... upset,
and I... thought she might want the D.N.A. Later,
so I went ahead and did it anyway,
but then I didn't tell her. And then I labeled it "Jane doe
and I locked it in the hospital refrigerator,
but... But I didn't report it.
well, that's illegal. Why wouldn't you...
because Charlotte made you promise.
you're staring at me.
I'm sorry.
and yet, you're still staring at me.
it's what we do-- the Addison and Sam.
we, uh, we do that.
Oh, god. I'm starting to sound like her, aren't I?
Oh, brother.- O-okay.
okay, um...
I have a thing...
that I can't tell you or anyone.
so I'm not gonna tell you.
but I need for you to get what I'm saying.
whoa. Did I black out for a minute? Because y-you are not making any sense.
okay. Uh... Talk to charlotte.
she wants to be left alone.
well, since when has that ever stopped you?
I mean, let's face it, Violet, you're--you're kinda nosy.
I am not. I-- I am-- I'm interested.
okay, talk to Charlotte.
she needs help.
and you are a shrink,
so... Do what shrinks do.
I saw Elisa this morning.
she's hanging in there.
no thanks to her crazy ass father.
you really think taking him to court is the right thing to do?
I had to do something. He was threatening to take her home.
if Diego tells the judge He's refusing treatment on religious grounds, you'll lose.
not necessarily. California Supreme Court prosecuted a mother whose child died of meningitis.
she'd refused lifesaving medical treatment In favor of divine healing.
look, I get that you're worried about Elisa.
I am, too.
but you're not gonna help her by tearing her family apart.
if Diego won't look out for his daughter's best interests, I will.
I don't know what I would do if she was my kid.
but Elisa and Diego have a right to follow their beliefs.
they're not crazy, cooper. They're just different.
and if you take them to court to force chemo...
I'll testify on their behalf.
he never complains.
his only concern is that I'll get hurt.
I don't mean to get so angry.
I just can't control myself.
okay. Enough whining. What do you think's going on?
well, there's nothing on the head M.R.I. Or chest C.T.
but I did find a high level of testosterone in your blood,
which could be caused by a tumor of the adrenal glands or lungs, - but I ruled that out... - Oh, that's good news.
or by metastatic breast cancer.
But...I-I had a mastectomy ten years ago.
I know, but sometimes, breast cancer cells can get left behind and grow somewhere else.
that could be a tumor on your ovary,
and if it's secreting testosterone, that buildup could cause sudden rages.
are you sure?
the only way to know for sure would be to go in and take a look,
but surgery is a big gamble for someone in your health.
I don't care. I want to do it for Nick.
please, Dr. Montgomery.
I-I can't hurt my husband anymore.
you got a minute?
what for? - It's been a few days.
I should take a look at your injuries.
they're fine. - Then this will be fast.
we can do it here or we could go to an exam room.
let's just get this over with.
everything is healing up beautifully.
told ya.
okay. Let's take a look at your back.
Oh, here. I got it. I got it.
Oh. Cooper did a crap job changing this bandage.
he didn't do it. I did.
I got it.
when it needs to be changed again, let me know.
Hey. Sorry I had to run out so early this morning.
you want to have lunch?
what is it with you people and food?
I don't want coffee or tea or doughnuts.
can't you just leave me alone?
I was just trying to be thoughtful.
no, you came in here to check on me.
I want you to stop hovering. - I'm not hovering.
all I need is for you and everybody else to back off.
I'm in this with you. - You are not inside this, Cooper.
you have no idea.
and now the way you're looking at me... Just stop.
I can't take it. I can't breathe.
Charlotte.
Dr. Montgomery will remove Rachel's tumor, then stage it to determine the necessary post-operative treatment,
and if all goes well, Rachel's testosterone levels will decrease, - And she'll have more control over her anger. - Good. That's good.
but if the surgery isn't successful, - And Rachel's rages continue - We'll get through it.
the love you and Rachel have for each other, it's a gift.
and under normal circumstances,
I would work to keep this marriage healthy another 50 years.
but sometimes...
sometimes I have to counsel people to walk away.
no one stays together anymore.
they just... Have a fight, get a divorce,
pretend like it never happened.
when instead, they should be fighting for each other,
through whatever comes.
this is what love is supposed to be.
I'm never walking away.
Hey, Elisa. How you feeling?
much, much better. I'm ready to go home now.
you need to heal a bit more first.
papi told me Dr. Freedman is bringing in a judge.
please. I don't want chemo.
do you believe a shaman can heal you?
papi does. - No, no, forget your father and Dr. Freedman.
I want to know what you believe.
if you have faith in a shaman,
I will back you with the judge.
it's okay. You can tell me.
Elisa, what is it?
I don't want chemo.
how long you been out here? - I don't know.
I couldn't sleep.
Hey. It's gonna be okay.
not if Violet doesn't talk to Charlotte. - She will.
what if somebody decides to look in the lab fridge,
you know, and they wonder what the "Jane doe" bag is?
I don't know what I was thinking.
you were thinking that you wanted to help a friend.
I could lose my license, Sam.
I mean, what-- what am I supposed to do?
we wait.
violet will come through.
that fresh?
I just made it.
help yourself.
thank you, Sheldon.
for what?
leaving me alone.
I wish everybody else would just, uh...
do nothing.
I'd do nothing for you anytime.
you know that, right?
I do.
how's it going? - Just dandy, thanks.
you know, I,uh...
I know how hard it can be to reintegrate after you've been...
victimized, so if you ever want to talk...
you always been such a busybody
or is that just a professional hazard?
no, actually, Charlotte, I...
I truly believe in the therapeutic process.
and after Katie attacked me
you think because a crazy woman cut out your baby,
you got some kind of an insight into what makes me tick?
you don't.
all you got's a nasty scar and a horror story.
you're damaged goods, Violet. You...
not me.
you got no business telling anybody how to run their lives.
have you got any tips for getting a 14-yea-old to talk?
I really want to go to bat for Elisa,
but she's holding something back.
well, she's a kid, and even as adults we're...
reluctant to... say certain things out loud.
you know, it makes it real, and then, you know...
you have to deal with it. - I wouldn't know anything about that.
Pete Wilder-- open book.
I know. It's not fair.
I push you to tell me things, and then I have stuff myself.
there was...
well, it happened a long time ago,
in college, and I never told you.
violet, I know.
or at least I suspected.
we have been through...a lot.
and I've seen you react in so many ways.
why didn't you say anything?
I figured that when you were ready to talk about it, you would.
Oh, I'm probably wrong. - What?
well, you were the first one to see her that night.
is it possible?
was Charlotte raped?
if she told me, you know I couldn't
no, I know, I know, of course. But...
but what do you think?
I think you're right.
don't.
what can I do?
what do you need?
lay really close to me...
but don't touch me.
it's been a long time Since I wore a pair of these.
what are you doing here?
I came to wish you luck. - Thanks.
you know, Nick and Rachel, they're special.
a lot of couples stay together for the long haul, but not many stay in love.
your parents still married?
no, no, they split when I was a teenager.
you close to them? - I call my mother every week, but my father and I...
well, let's just say that when you wash out of your E.R. Rotation
and you're a surgeon's son, it doesn't help the relationship.
I guess it could make you a little odd and a little pretentious.
who's to say those are bad things?
I'll call you when it's over.
Alice believed in chemo, and I believed in Alice,
so that's what we did.
but she's gone now.
I've seen the shaman heal people.
I think she can do the same for my Elisa.
what do you want, Elisa?
what papi wants. - What about your mother?
Alice would've pushed for this chemo. She wouldn't want you to die.
don't say that. How dare you say that. She's not gonna die.
you honor, what Diego is asking for may seem unconventional, but I have seen it work.
as an M.D. and also a practitioner of alternative therapies, I urge you,
please, don't disregard what Diego is asking for.
the only guaranteed cure for lymphoma is chemotherapy.
I need to take the family's religious beliefs into account
okay, but what kind of father just stands by and doesn't save their child?
stop it. Please, Dr. Freedman.
if I have more chemo, my family won't make it.
we're living in a trailer park because of me.
my treatments bankrupted us,
and papi had to sell the house.
I hear you on the phone, begging to keep the power on.
I see you skipping meals so the rest of us can eat.
Carlos and Pilar... They deserve a life
that doesn't revolve around my hospital visits.
and so do you.
the shaman will save you. - No, she won't.
I'm sorry, papi. I don't believe what you believe.
I'm not afraid.
let the shaman take me to mama.
I think we all know what needs to be done.
do you think I don't know what's true anymore because I was attacked?
I think working through that experience has made you a better therapist.
Sam told me I should talk to Charlotte. - Well, that's not surprising.
you both survived a brutal trauma. - Yeah, yeah, but the way he said it,
it was like there was more to it than that.
and then I- I just started projecting my own stuff on her.
well, what sort of stuff?
I wish you had been there... that night,
then we could compare notes.
unfortunately I spent the night in an interrogation room
getting throttled by a rapist, so...
is that what...
do you think Charlotte was raped?
the judge ordered the chemo. You didn't have to arrange this.
I know.
I'm just saying-- I'm not completely unreasonable.
thank you for letting us bend the rules.
I made sure she wasn't gonna sacrifice a chicken or anything.
I know I should leave you alone.
but here's the thing-- I can't.
you're not ready.
Cooper - I know you.
it didn't go well, did it?
the tumor was worse than the imaging originally showed.
I couldn't resect it all. I removed what I could.
no. I can't accept that.
you have to stop the cancer.
h- how long do I have?
not as long as you'd want.
there are testosterone blocking agents we could try to manage your anger,
but... They're not very effective.
uh, so I'm just gonna keep on hurting Nick?
there's nothing I can do?
you can move into hospice for around-the-clock care
with people who know how to manage your anger and who'll keep you safe.
what the hell are you talking about?
don't listen to him, Rachel. We can manage at home.
you know that's not true, love.
I'm dying.
you don't know how long you have.
I want that time with you.
I don't care what you do to me.
but I do.
those people at hospice, they won't know how to take care of you.
I've learned that over the past 20 years. I'm good at it.
well, then you'll tell them how, every day,
when you come to visit.
you'll find a place where I can go?
Yes. I promise.
it's the right thing, Nick.
you know it is.
please...
let me take care of you for once.
Yeah.
you need something?
it was an Indian summer...
my junior year in college.
and I'd left the window open because it was the only way
to cool down enough to get to sleep.
so when I first felt his breath on me...
I thought, finally, a breeze.
and then I opened my eyes.
he wrapped one hand around my throat,
and with the other, ripped off my panties.
he whispered to me...
shh, shh, shh, shh,
like, um...
like you do to a child having a bad dream.
he told me not to make a sound.
and when he finished, he...slammed my head against the wall
till my hair was sticky with blood.
I thought...
that...
if I stayed quiet, then I'd be okay...
like it never happened.
because things that like, well...
they don't happen to people like me...
or to people like you.
so...
I just wanted you to know...
that I get it. I get it, Charlotte.
and I'm here for you.
Shelly, what are you doing here?
the guy I evaluated last week-- Lee Mchenry?
Yeah.
I think I know who he raped.
Yes, this is, uh, Dr. Addison Montgomery at St. Ambrose.
I have pelvic washings from a rape that need to be processed.
Charlotte. - What happened?
will you go to a meeting with me?
I'm right behind you.
hey who's there? It's very late to be knocking...
what the hell is that? Come on!
who are you? Stop banging!
stop it! Just stop banging!
hello. - Good morning, Mak, this is your wake up call.
I had another nightmare.
how is it? Are you okay?
well, I'm fine. Just a bad dream.
how's it? Are you gonna buy me a villa?
what are you talking about? What villa? Just tell me when I see you.
okay. Nak, I love you.
Nak loves Mak too.
going to work now?
no Father, I'm meeting Nak.
here, what about your breakfast?
it's okay, I'll have breakfast with Nak.
we're going to see a house.
they serve breakfast at this house?
no Mother.
we'll probably get something to eat beforehand.
forget it!
mother? Father? Did you hear something last night?
no. Nothing.
no. Why?
it must have been nothing. See you.
Nak! Not here. It's too public.
I haven't seen you in twelve hours.
this time I saw her.
saw what?
this woman.
what woman?
in my nightmare.
her smile was black.
she had no teeth. No gums. Just shiny black.
it was very real. Very scary.
well from next week I'll be sharing the bed with you.
so this woman will have to smile at me first before she can scare you again.
maybe a change of home will improve things.

driver stop here please.
I've got to get up early to see Master Tring.
which Master Tring?
our Fortune Teller for the wedding plans.
why don't you ask him about me and Chai?
I don't believe a word he says.
I'm only doing this for my Mom and Grandma.
Oh, C'mon! It's tradition.
I'm doing it just for you. I gotta go now.
bye bye.
Mak. Is that you Mak?
Nak, What's happened?
have you seen a ghost?
grandma, you know I don't believe in ghosts.
Kong!
Nak, aren't you scared walking through this cemetery?
I don't mind. I've been walking through this way many years.
by the way, Did you get my flowers?
I'm in a rush Kong. I don't have time to talk.
and stop sending me flowers!
don't do it Nak. Do you know you'll make a big mistake!
kong, What are you saying?
don't marry him. You can't do it.
kong, I don't care what you think.
I am going to marry Mak. I love Mak!
but I love you Nak.
good morning, Master Tring.
my Mom and Grandma asked me to tell you that we've done everything you have suggested for the wedding.
actually, it's not my suggestion.
but what the astrological readings inform us.
we must live by them.
and they will guide us to happiness and a fulfilling future.
my Mom and Grandma hope that you'll attend our reception and blessing.
I'll do my best for you, Nak.
thank you.
master Tring.
your first morning reading is waiting.
go back.
I'll leave now.
wait!
master Tring would like completion of payment today.
Yes.
what is this?
there should be another two hundred?
are you sure?
Oh I thought my Mom said...?
I don't know what your mom said but there's two hundred Baht missing.
I'm sorry.
Nak you scared me!
what are you eating?
grandma gave it to me.
it was once a very beautiful look to have many years ago.
kiss me Mak and taste some...
let me see how you look.
it's probably not good for teeth... here wash your mouth and drink some water.
Nak!
what is it Mak?
I'm okay. Just got a fright.
what was it? Can you tell me?
nothing Nak...
your Father would have loved your wedding day Nak.
I guess Mr. Preecha will go through all the paperwork within this week.
well let me know if you need more help.
yes Father.
let's hope it gets done before you go on holiday next Saturday.
krabi is such a beautiful place.
Nak, I don't know if you remember but Mak's Father and I went there three years ago.
to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.
well a toast to Mak and Nak's wedding.
and may they return to Krabi in 25 years to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
Cheers!
Mak what are you doing... You'll fall.
everyone would take his wife back make love to her.
Nak!
I'm sure I locked it...
I think someone has broken in.
our stuff is missing.
look! Our wedding gifts have been stolen too.
hoping you can find our stuff soon as possible
don't worry, we tried our best
Thanks, you are welcome
what did the police say?
there's not much they can do.
except wait and see if any of the gifts turn up.
the thieves will probably try and sell our stuff on the street.
then we'd have to prove they were ours.
it's a pity. They took my wedding suit.
it had a wedding gift I bought for Nak in it.
it was an antique brooch. I would like to get that back.
will you be okay staying here tonight?
yes we'll be fine. This is our house.
what about the neighbours. Didn't they see anything?
nothing. Police spoke to them but no one saw anything.
they said nothing to see
that's crazy!
you've only got to fart where I live and a neighbour will come around to have a good sniff.
how much? I will buy all if you gave me a reasonable price
Hey!
go quickly
don't go please!
hurry up, get in!
don't let too many in
Mak. I'm here Mak...
it's Nak next to you.
can you hear me? Mak
mak... wake up and talk to me.
I'm here, Mak.
can you hear me?
Nak, Doctor has got something to...
are you Nak?
I'm Doctor Grid. You must be Mak's wife.
what happened? Why is he like this?
we know he was in a hit and run accident.
it has left Mak in a coma.
coma? When will he wake up?
it's hard to tell at this stage.
we are monitoring him for any responses.
Mak's parent just arrived.
doctor I'll go with you.
find Mae Nak.
you must find Mae Nak.
doctor, Mak spoke to me. He spoke!
are you sure that Mak spoke to you?
but the monitor shows no response at all.
he's been stable... no change at all.
you have to rest.
you have to keep your strength so you can be with Mak.
I mean it
you've been at his bedside all day.
you haven't eaten much... nothing at all.
I've made a congee for you... eat some.
here... eat Nak.
grandma! Mak said something to me this morning in hospital.
are you sure he spoke to you?
the Doctor said there was no change.
Yes, he did!
he told me to find Mae Nak.
to find Mae Nak?
but Mae Nak... is a Ghost!
ghost! What do you mean a Ghost?
what I am going to tell you is the story of Mae Nak.
over a hundred years ago, there was a young woman called Nak.
Nak married a young man named Mak.
they were very much in love.
and their marriage was a true commitment...
they were inseparable. Because they loved each other very much.
and they were blessed with conception of a child.
but then the dream was broken...
her Mak had to go to war...
Mak was seriously injured.
the monks helped him recover.
soon Mak was ready to return to his true love... his Nak.
they were together again as a family.
but then Mak noticed that things had changed.
the neighbours they knew so well had gone.
people would not stop at their house.
Mak MO feels strange, he tried to find out
but got no answer
so he goes to next village to find the answer
finally someone told MO she died in childbirth, and that she was now a ghost!
that night the GHOST OF MAE NAK had her revenge on the village.
the dead were the people that tried to take Mak away from Nak.
she would not let them.
she cursed them and stopped them.
the villagers awake Mak to face the truth about his young wife.
that she is dead and he has been living with a ghost who has struck revenge.
on those who tried to come between her and Mak...
there in the grave was the decaying body of the young Mae Nak.
Mak's wife and true love and next to her their dead child.
the Higher Dignitary performed an exorcism on Nak and her child.
they were made to rest in peace.
mae Nak no longer sought revenge on those who tried to stop her love between her and her Mak.
grandma, why did Mae Nak want revenge?
she wanted to keep the true love she had. Her love for her Mak was so overwhelming.
it became her obsession,
you're late Tick! Where have you been?
the scrap guy is waiting for you.
I know! I know! I had to go the long way round.
police are everywhere.
so you need to get to the scrap yard as soon as possible.
I'm scared Tock!
call me when it's done.
murderer! Thief!
who is this?
who are you?
where have you been?
I've been waiting for you. You're late.
here's your money.
you can go. I'll do this myself.
now all the tests show that Mak is physically normal.
but he is still in his coma.
he has no response at all.
we are going to do a brain scan today.
hopefully that will pinpoint a cause for his state.
you can buy it if you're gonna look at it that close!
where did you get this?
this was stolen from my house!
hey Tock! Come here Tock!
I'll call the police!
call the police?
take your hands out of the pocket or I'll cut it off!
look she's taken something!
Mak I went to see our Estate Lawyer, Mr. Preecha, about the house.
he had good news to tell. The house is finally ours Mak.
Mak look! I found something.
I found the brooch you brought for me.
it's so beautiful, Mak.
it feels so strange.
very cold.
mak, feel it.
Mak did you see that?
it was me and you. Our first kiss.
you are lucky Master Tring will see you at such short notice.
it must be important?
I am saddened to hear about your Mak.
but he is strong. I'm sure he'll be okay.
I'll read his chart for him and we will see a positive future.
master Tring I must ask you about another concern.
Mak told me that he was having nightmares.
and he was being haunted by a vision of a ghost woman.
and when he was in hospital, he spoke to me from his sleep.
he said "Find Mae Nak"!
what is that mean?
mae Nak is not a stuff
could you tell me?
master, please give me a direction
mae Nak? Mae Nak is a ghost.
Yes. My Grandma told me her story.
this is why I come to see you. To give me an answer.
what did they do to her?
the Higher Dignitary at that time put a stop to Mae Nak's curses and vengeance.
he exorcised her to rest in peace.
the Higher Dignitary removed a piece of bone from Mae Nak's skull.
he now had Nak's spirit held in the bone.
her grave was filled in and forgotten... Unmarked and lost in the woods and in time.
the bone was made into a brooch that the Dignitary wore until his last day.
what happened to the brooch then?
legend has it that the brooch was lost in time.
it is still out there...
but holding Nak's spirit inside.
Nak what is this!
I knew it,
I sensed something strong and evil when you entered the house.
is this the girdle brooch made from the bones of Mae Nak!
take it out! Take it out!
master! Master!
master. What is wrong? Master!
what happened?
I ask what happened?
get out! I can deal with this!
master! Master! Master!
master is well now but needs rest.
I don't understand what happened.
his strong visions overpower him controlling his body and mind.
he explained to me about the object you have.
this object is very very valuable.
and must be handled carefully.
it's extremely powerful and can cause you great harm.
so it's true? This belongs to Mae Nak!
Yes, it is. Master has asked that I take you to a Higher Dignitary to discuss the outcome of the brooch.
master does not want it to fall into wrong hands.
it will be very dangerous for you to keep.
come let's go now.
where are you going? Wait!
Mak loves Nak.
Nak loves Mak.
our love forever and ever and ever.
nobody comes here anymore.
it used to be a nursery for young children.
but they had to close it.
because of the children seeing the GHOSTS.
it was a burial ground many many years ago.
a burial ground?
kong
Nak
so, what's back there?
what do you want Kong?
I'm sorry to hear about Mak's accident.
I called your Mom to say
I er'... couldn't come to your wedding.
then she told me about Mak.
I was shocked Nak.
are you okay?
I kept thinking back to when your Father died, and you come to me.
I'm here for you Nak.
look Kong! You were not invited to my wedding.
and you have no right to call my Mom.
I told you leave me alone! Don't you understand?
if Mak doesn't survive, if he dies, then you will be alone.
but I'll still be here for you.
forget Mak.
get off!
our love forever and ever and ever.
Nak
Mak's Mother and Father have arranged for a Monk to come and pray for Mak.
it will give him strength.
Noi. Chai.
I need your help.
I want to explain something to you.
I believe that the old nursery is the burial place of Mae Nak.
somehow she connected with Mak through his dreams and was trying to tell him something.
tell him something?
I think she wants to be at peace.
we have to return what is hers.
and how do we do that?
we dig.
we dig and find the remains of Mae Nak.
Nak are you sure no one owns this place?
I've checked. We're okay.
but I think we should speak to the Police first.
and tell them what? That we are digging for a ghost!
there!
we have to dig here!
why there Nak? Why do we have to dig there?
okay! But if we don't find anything after thirty minutes, then we go home.
okay, but now we have to dig.
let's dig it!
some water for you Chai?
C'mon Chai you've done enough. Let's go home now... Chai?
Gotta' dig! The ground's so hard...
gotta keep digging! The ground is so...
this is a bone!
it was a baby!
why is it buried here?
now we have to call the Police!
no we can't... Not now... we need to keep digging.
Nak we can't. This needs a serious police investigation.
we have to call them.
hello Mom! What is it?
yes I'm with Chai and Noi.
we'll be there right away.
something very serious has happened to Mak. We've got to go to the hospital now.
let's go now.
what's about this?
let's find something to cover it.
Nak, What have you been doing?
we've been working on the house.
this is the brain scan of Mak.
we are concerned that there may be injuries to the brain.
such as a hemorrhage, that we cannot detect.
so we are going to do intensive tests.
it will show signs of damage to the brain.
we are treating this as an emergency procedure and we want to start tonight.
we are worried that Mak's brain might be permanently damaged...
Mak
Mak
Mak
can you hear me Mak?
what would happen such phenomenon?
shocking treatment ready ready go home now!
I won't go! Let us go!
mae Nak!
mae Nak!
I was worried about you Nak. I had to call the police.
don't worry Nak I told them I'll help you.
come back to my place.
Nak!
grandma
I don't understand.
why doesn't Mae Nak release my Mak?
why Grandma?
I will take you to someone who can help.
legend says that the spirit of Mae Nak was very revengeful on those who tried to stop her love.
she will do them great harm.
how do you do!
Hi!
how are you feeling Nak?
much better now thanks.
it was a difficult night for us all last night.
where is Mak now?
he is in safe hands now.
he was taken to a monastery where they will help him.
the monks will remove the spirit that possesses him.
we have given them our permission for an exorcism.
Mrs. Grimm?
are you there?
I have brought my granddaughter Nak here.
she needs your help.
who is it?
can't you remember my voice?
Yes. Come in, come inside.
how wonderful it is to have you visit us with your grandmother.
so you must be Nak?
I remember you when you were a little girl.
and I remember her grandmother when she was a young girl.
Oh don't talk about such ancient times.
may I touch your face Nak?
it's how Mrs. Grimm sees you.
Yes, of course.
there now I can see you Nak. You are very beautiful.
now let's find out how we can help you young Nak.
come inside the house.
Mrs. Grimm is tuning into the spirit world.
she has been a spiritualist all her life.
Oh I nearly forget... This may help.
Nak was holding it all last night.
Ah! Wonderful!
let Mrs. Grimm hold it. It may help.
you are surrounded by pure love, young Nak.
the presence that this belongs to is reading out to you through this pure love.
the presence is a woman.
a woman who is not at peace.
who cannot rest.
the presence is with us.
she's here with us.
we sense that you are with us here.
will you talk to us? Yes or no?
will you communicate with us? Yes or no?
we are here to help you.
sure
what is your name?
do we know you?
are you connected to us? Yes or no?
no.
what is your name?
mae Nak.
mae Nak.
is there someone here you wish to communicate with?
will you tell us why you are not at rest?
speak to Nak. Nak is with us here.
what do you want of Nak?
Nak. Help me.
help me.
why do you feel no peace?
what help do you need?
speak to Nak. Nak is with us.
release me.
release me. Release me!
release me. Release me!
the spirit of Mae Nak has been awoken by the true love that you and your Mak have for each other.
it is the love that she once had and misses deeply.
I did everything I could.
I searched until I found her.
and you must continue young Nak.
but what does she want?
you must return what belongs to Mae Nak.
Nak, I must warn you that your Mak is in great danger.
your grandmother told me about the exorcism they plan to do on Mak tonight.
they will do him great harm.
you must stop them Nak.
Nak, what are you doing here?
Chai, I need your help.
I need to go to the Police morgue.
you're going to create serious problems for yourself you know.
please Chai you must help me. This will be the last time I promise.
look Nak this whole thing has caused a strain between Noi and I.
noi is worried I may lose my job.
Chai, I just need you to help me get inside the Police morgue, that's all.
I have to help Mak.
Mak is in good hands now.
the monks are taking care of him.
you'll make things worse for him.
Chai you must help me.
if you don't help me Chai you could be in danger too.
mae Nak can do strange things.
Nak. Stop it. Enough talk about ghosts and bones and such crazy nonsense!
Nak!
touch this.
you'll be in great danger Chai.
mae Nak won't let anyone stop her.
happy now?
okay Nak I'm going to drive you home.
and then I'll have some explaining to Noi because I'll be late and...
which department you belong to?
I work in the pay-roll department.
I need to collect the job sheets.
they were meant to be sent over today.
so I came over myself. On my way home.
you guys need to get paid this month right?
okay.
Thanks.
quickly Nak. Get under here.
you might need this flashlight inside.
hey where are you taking that?
it was blocking the entrance.
I'm just returning it.
returning it? Returning it where?
that's my job.
Hello? Yeah. Where are you?
I can't come. I'm working tonight.
have a guess who I'm with.
that man who got sliced in two by glass.
it's been mad busy all week.
we've got that train guy in too. Lost his head. Clean off.
our love for ever and ever.
and look after each other forever.
I've done everything you want me to do.
now you give back Mak to me.
give my Mak back to me!
thank you!
mae Nak can rest in peach now.
they say that this temple is also the resting place of her Mak.
he is telling you that we will burn the coffin tonight.
this will complete the religious ceremony.
everything's all done now.
now you'll be happy together.
Nak, come and look at this photo.
Mak.
come and be with me Mak.
No! I'm not your Mak.
don't you remember me Mak?
where is Nak?
where is my wife?
mae Nak...
I'm not your Mak.

no time to explain!
help me please!
Nak!
mak!
please help me!
Mak
help me. There's somebody in here!
mak! Help me.
Nak!
Yes, on a job
hush. I think he's really stuck on your sister.
I'll bet he doesn't even know his own name now.
what's your name?
I have no idea.
did you steal the diamonds?
I did.
where did you put them?
my partner hid them.
how can we recover them?
he put the clue on two different women.
how can I find them?
I needn't bother now that I've found you.
you heard it, Baldy.
I think he stole the diamonds.
are you lying?
no, I am not.
I'd lie to Baldy and that bitch but,
I'd never lie to you.
why are you holding my hand?
so what, we're both men.
you heard, he knows where the diamonds are.
I am assigning you to be responsible for his safety, before we find the diamonds.
Oh no, the bomb.
who delivered it?
I did.
go bring it back, quick.
there isn't enough time.
Why?
there's only time for the trip up.
he has to be kept alive. Go get the bomb.
aren't you gonna leave?
me, leave?!
it's much nicer here.
the steak is good but your sister is a little too much...
what did you say?
just a tiny weeny little bit.
even the door bell sounds good.
I'm really enjoying the stay.
wrong address.
dumb jerk.
heavy shoes?! On your way now please.
here it comes!
run for cover.
all the tattoos on Joe, are done by this guy.
let's hope he remembers.
please think carefully.
what did have he tattooed?
it's always a woman's name or telephone no.
he's got it all over his body.
did he bring any woman for a tattoo?
Yes, two of them.
and he wanted them done here.
what did he want tattooed?
how can I remember? They come, they go...
this clue's dead.
chance for locating the diamonds becomes small.
and chance for going into the jail becomes big.
you are too hasty.
we still have another clue.
and that is...?
he shouted Rose before he died.
I think that's the name of his girl friend.
hello there.
did you just come out from the tattoo place?
Yes.
then you must have a picture taken.
Why?
everybody does it after his tatto's done.
do you think...
it's right here, step this way.
rose?!
actually, we didn't come for the photo session.
then what do you want?
get out.
I came to pick up some photos for my friend.
and who may that be?
did anybody have a nude picture taken?
Burt did!
so you're friends of Burt Reynolds.
no, we're friends of Joe.
I don't know what you're talking about?
the guy with all the girl's telephones tattooed all over, and always talking nonsense.
I know, you mean Gigolo Joe.
that's right.
he only left a deposit and never come back.
the photos are vital to us.
I forgot where I put them.
I'm quite busy, you know...
please look for them...
let me do it.
keep watch for me, whistle if someone turns up.
you're in for it now...
what do you want? Money?
I'm married.
no problem.
I am quite old.
I am not choosy.
I'm not so pretty.
better than nothing.
what? A stocking.
she wouldn't recognize me then.
you better put one on too.
Oh no!
I'll give you the photos.
smart!
give it to me!
it's all here.
I found out.
one of the girls work at this taxicab place.
leave the talking to me.
Why?
you can only handle the older dames.
with younger ones, it's me or nothing.
I'm not so sure.
I was in a Body Building Contest once.
And?
I won, of course!
how many entrants were there?
just me, of course!
anyway, just keep your mouth shut.

I've got you now, I win.
what are you doing in here again?
I forgot my jacket.

I think you'd better get her an analyst.
hello. It's for Superintendent Ho.
Oh, it's for your sis.
even I heard from outside.
it's for me.
it's Squealie here.
Squealie, where the hell have you been?
I told you to check out Mad Max. You jerk.

Oh yes she will, after I've been through with her.

according to my analysis.
Joe made these tattoos, take away the hearts and, if you read across.
you'll see that it says.
map.
a map. Right.
Joe also kept saying Kowloon.
so now, let's look at a Kowloon map.
the clue is in P6.
it's in the middle of the sea. Right!
what does the rest stand for?
what?
your guess is as good as mine.
there's B3.
right.
old Joe isn't so dumb after all.
bit like you.
the diamonds must be under the buddy.
naturally.
but I can't swim.
neither can I.
it's never too late to start learning.
see, you're doing just fine.
you're really something.
I've got it.
after them.
don't bother. The real ones are here.
Hey, you're really good.
damn Baldy.

that's got rid of her.
ready. Anytime you are.
hurry. Come on.
didn't you say you have a trump card?

top secret.
at the right time. It's either you or him now.
what about you?
I'll just watch.
there's White Glove, hurry.
I think he's had it now.
not fair to him, it's us 2 against him.
O. K. Baldy, all yours.
what about you?
you can handle this, it's nothing.
I think you'd better get ready too.
you can call Ho on the walkie talkie now.

I threw the damn thing away.
Oh! But you have a trump card.
it's not here.
Oh no! Let me do the driving.

Oh no.

Colin Raimes? Open the door, please! Police!
Mr. Raimes, we have a warrant to search the house and remove property in compliance with the Criminal Evidence Act.
smack his face in!
this is gonna look very bad on your arrest report, Colin.
interview commenced at 11. 19 a. m.
the suspect will state his name.
Colin Raimes.
also present are the suspect's lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker.
look at these photos, Colin.
Lauren Chester.
murdered in November last year.
kidnapped, no sexual assault, starved and held for 30 hours.
strangled with bootlace.
you're upsetting him. - Bettina Mitchell.
attacked last Saturday.
you said: "Fight me and you will end up like Lauren."
this is the ID picture that Bettina gave us.
this is your diary.
we found it in your room.
from the diary, quote:"I killed her. She's been killed. I'm a killer, an ace killer."
that particular entry is not awash with ambiguity.
dated November 4th.
the day after the murder.
Colin's a first-rate fantasist.
so let's talk about the night of the abduction, Colin.
november 2nd.
hold on. November 2nd?
that's correct.
he was at our drop-in centre.
some kids had thrown fireworks at him. He was distressed.
we brought him to the centre.
I think we're done.
Colin Raimes.
Colin Raimes isn't our man.
we'll go back to our best lead.
the fibres found underneath the fingernails of the victim.
definitely synthetic.
I think there's more to be had from Raimes.
let's lean on him.
what, and be sued for harassment of a schizophrenic?
he's a fantasist. It's in his psych evaluation...
screw his psych evaluation!
you used to believe in gut feeling. What happened?
nothing.
Sam, what is going on in there?
look, I can't think about this now. Ok?
I'm gonna stand you down from the case, Maya.
it's not productive, given our personal problems.
look, forget about us.
I have a theory about Raimes. About why he kept a diary.
I've made my mind up...
don't you wanna know what I'm thinking? My feeling is...
look around you. What use are feelings in this room?
Maya.
why are you shutting me out?
what are you doing?
I'm following my feeling, Sam.
I think there's more to Raimes.
I think he's trying to impress someone.
what if he knows the killer?
hang on. If social services find out...
where are you, Maya?
I'm tailing Raimes.
you're breaking up.
someone's there.
Raimes is heading up toward Satchmore Road. I'm gonna go and...
Maya, no. Listen, I'll send back-up.
Ah! - Maya!
preserve the scene, call in SOCO please.
whoever the killer is, he's taken her.
charge to 200 Joules.
stand clear.
where are you?
what happened?
did you not see the signs?
do you remember what happened, Sir?
sir, can you tell me what happened?
this...
this is not my car. I was...
I was driving a Jeep.
you were driving a military vehicle?
hang on.
what's going on?
it says here you on transfer from C Division in Hyde.
detective Inspector.
I'm a DCI.
what the hell are you?
I need my mobile.
your mobile what?
phone!
860 to Alpha... Hang on Sir, come back.
860... Sir, come back! 860...
I'll call you back.
DC Chris Skelton.
Plod's bringing in your stuff.
one of the girls will sort out your RTA.
don't sweat it if you've had a couple of stiff ones.
blimey. You look like you've ten rounds with Big Henry.
someone needs to take a look at you, boss.
you're as white as a ginger bird's arse.
Oh aye. She can kiss it better. - Shut up.
I don't know who the hell you lot think you are...
but this is my office.
here.
this is a door, right here.
and my desk is here.
Where's my desk?
chair?
pc terminal? - Who?
you want a constable up here?
what the bloody hell is going on here?
this is my department!
what have you done with it?
keep it down, boss.
too late.
surprise me.
what year is it supposed to be?
word in your shell-like, pal.
big mistake.
what about this?
they reckon you got concussion.
I couldn't give a tart's furry cup if half your brains are falling out.
don't ever waltz into my kingdom acting king of the jungle.
who the hell are you? - Gene Hunt, your DCI, and it's 1973.
almost dinner time. I'm havin' 'oops.
it's funny.
I could have sworn I left it here. Remember.
lock your car. Check the doors, the windows, the boot.
and please, take the keys with you.
watch out, there's a thief about there.
operator?
operator. - No, I want a mobile number.
what? - A mobile number.
is that an international number?
no.
I need you to connect me to a Virgin number.
virgin Mobile...
don't you start that sexy business with me, young man.
I can trace this call.
it's an emergency and cross-match blood down.
he's slipping into unconsciousness. Sam?
can you hear me? Sam?
just had a shout.
that bird who went missing a couple of days ago?
she's only been done in down Satchmore Road.
Satchmore? That's where Maya...
Susie Tripper? - Yeah.
wrung her neck like a Christmas turkey.
right.
I've gotta get down the pub and give the papers a statement.
if I don't get a move on, they'll all be half-cut.
so, you're a senior officer, you're in charge.
boss?
shall we make a start?
Susie'd been dead for a couple of hours when she was found.
no sign of sexual assault.
this is what she had on her.
bloody hell.
so, then, boss?
anything you wanna...?
right. Yeah, uh...
have you visited the crime scene ?
what, where she was found?
Yeah, where she was found.
have you... preserved the crime scene?
body's on the slab.
body should have been dusted for prints on site.
how the hell are you gonna get dabs off skin?
you're so right. How can you?
what's the matter with me?
we did take some prints off a shoe, I think it was.
they've been sent down to Scotland Yard, so we should hear back in a fortnight or so, if there's a match.
a fortnight?
motive doesn't seem to be robbery.
there's 27p in her purse, plus a couple of green shields.
well, he might have taken the notes.
I mean, who's gonna take 27p?
well, I would.
after pub closing time, she stayed in the car park with a couple of fellas, but that's cool.
cool, is it? Why?
well, we know 'em. Loaders from canal wharf. They're alright.
now she was in the car park, and she was giving them Downhill Racer...
so you're not gonna take statements?
it's not them, boss.
wake up.
he didn't shag her. He didn't rob her.
so what's the motive?
Garrotted with a thin cord.
no other attack marks, nothing in or around the mouth.
what have you learnt from the stomach contents?
well, er...
Chris, have a look.
in the file, in the post-mortem file.
she wasn't fed for at least a day before she was killed.
and she was found in Satchmore Road.
come on!
enough! Come on!
stop it now! Enough!
stop! End! Finish! Come on!
walls wet, er...
I can smell the preserving agent, soap in the tray, er...
ham sandwich, half-eaten...
I can hear somebody whistling outside.
you need to get some rest, boss.
you just need a large Scotch and a bit of a kip.
it's him.
he's killed before.
we'll er... get a plonk to give you the once over.
no broken bones then.
do you feel like you're gonna heave up?
I feel a bit nauseous.
you'll do. You've had hangovers worse.
are you a doctor?
I'm about as qualified as Doctor Kildare.
I'm part of the Women's Department.
the what? - Don't you have plonks in Hyde?
go on, sir. Off you jolly well trot.
what now?
what's your name?
wpc Cartwright. - No, first name.
I was four in 1973, Annie.
hit me.
don't tempt me.
you've been in an accident. - Hit me.
shit! - I'm sorry, sir.
Hey, good girl. Prostate probe and no jelly.
why don't you call it a day, Tyler? Chris'll drive you to your place.
my... place? - Yeah, they gave us an address.
unless, of course, you're getting a bit of a taste for it in here, hmm?
this guy kills, then, what, he waits another thirty years?
is that why I'm here, because that's when he first struck?
does that make sense?
Yeah. Loads of sense.
Maya thought that Raimes knew the killer.
Colin Raimes! No, no, he'd still be in nappies.
I can take him home.
take him. He's yours.
this is Neil.
Sam.
can you hear me?
do you want me to take you home?
this is it.
it's not so bad, is it?
Mr. Enoch Powell has called for an increase in taxation to deal with inflation.
Mr. Powell called for an autumn budget...
I'm not mad. I'm not.
I had an accident.
and I woke up 33 years in the past.
now, that either makes me a time-traveller or a lunatic, or...
I'm lying in a hospital bed in 2006 and none of this is real.
33 years in the future?
that's where you're saying you're from?
see, Maya - that's my girlfriend
she's been kidnapped by the same killer who strangled Susie Tripper yesterday.
I think you should go to a hospital and ask them to check you for concussion.
he'll hold her for a day, and then...
don't you see? It's the same killer in both times.
paranoid delusion, brought about by the accident.
it's not concussion. It's psychological.
pretty fancy words for a WPC.
I studied psychology at university.
I'm just saying, I think it's a medical thing and you should sign off sick and see somebody.
what if you're my mind telling me this is real?
you'll have to work this one out on your own.
Thanks.
you know, for listening to what I had to say and then not calling the men in the white coats.
di Tyler, you don't seem like the rest of them, and you're clever enough to know that what you're saying can't be true.
Yes, it's beating.
I have to go. - Where?
what do you care? I'm not real.
as soon as I walk out that door, poof, I'm gone.
here I go.
ready, steady...
get some rest.
but what concerns us most is regulating his breathing.
that is why we have to keep the endotracheal tube in place.
I have to stress to you that Sam is in low responsiveness, but is not in a persistent vegetative state.
although he has suffered a severe cranial trauma.
but the Glasgow scale does put him at a deep level of coma.
you're talking about me!
I'm here, I can hear you, look at me, I'm here!
at times, however, he moves. Murmurs.
has motor response as though caught up in some sort of deep REM sleep from which he cannot wake.
well, this gives us some hope, despite the brain-stem bruising.
Hey! I'm here!
look at me, does this look like low responsiveness to you?! I'm here!
I can hear you, I can hear you! - Sam Tyler?
wait! No!
wait, don't leave me, I'm in BUPA!
please don't leave me!
no, please, I'm here!
don't leave me here!
please don't leave me!
bloody hell, I've seen road accidents more cheerful.
where are you today, here or planet of the Clangers?
didn't know if you were gonna show, boss.
where else could I go?
well, we're honoured.
right, we've pulled a bird in, Dora Keynes.
she was the last person to see the victim alive.
is she a suspect? - No, just a pain in the arse.
OK. Alright.
brief me in full.
what do I need to know? - She's a pain in the arse.
what, so you've handed her in to Lost Property?
well, we could use the canteen, but she's a right mouthy bird, this one.
hang on.
you're gonna do the interview in there?
thick walls.
you had a drink with Susie the night she died, didn't you, Dora?
I know you. From the picket line.
you put the boot into my old man.
Oh, happy days. - Sod off.
can't, love.
this is my esteemed colleague, DI Tyler.
Hi, Dora.
I want you to call me Sam. - You really a copper?
possibly.
when was the last time you saw Susie?
in my dreams.
how did she seem, that night?
did she mention meeting anyone?
she was horny.
did she get into an argument with a stranger.
you know the answer.
it's blowing in the wind.
I'm done with this game. Let's play another.
let's play hopscotch or pin the tail on the donkey, you pick, Dora.
I want a lawyer.
I wanna hump Britt Ekland, what are we gonna do?
your dad's waiting to take you home.
what the hell did you do to her?
well, you know. The usual.
then banged her up for obstruction. Kids, eh?
where I come from, you'd be looking at suspension.
really, what, for making a breakthrough?
at 11. 20, she saw Susie Tripper heading away from the pub, followed by a tall bloke with long hair.
the hair under those nails is not human, it's synthetic.
Yeah. Chris told me what happened in the mortuary.
I need a drink.
that 's the first sensible thing you've said since you got here.
haven't uniform got their own boozer?
you have to rubber-eel mine?
Ah, DCI Hunt.
mon brave.
you catching flies, brudder?
which part of my subconscious do you hail from?
I like you.
I like you.
Nelson's a good bloke.
What're your poisons? - Tan and bitter. Sam?
diet Coke.
I'm just joking. Pint of bitter.
give it up then.
alright.
the man you're looking for is either wearing thick gloves of some sort, or he's using... a bag, or something, made of coarse material, gets under the nails.
you can't know that from one stiff.
I've seen another. Look, I'm telling you...
what does it matter anyway?
none of this is real!
you're just some thug who crawled out of some dark little pit in the back of my mind.
then report me.
see you, Gene.
give my regards to the id.
alright! Right now! Let it be now! Come on!
you're new.
and you've got something big crammed up your jacksie, but don't worry, you'll learn.
I may be the sheriff, but I'm a deputy to the law. Now, I don't care...
if you want to take a swing for me if it makes you feel good, but what I do ask is that you don't hide anything from me.
so, have you got a hunch about this case?
with what I know, I could find this killer.
prove it.
look for these leads cropping up in any box in the room.
priority.
priority. Will call.
so where did you get these names from?
call it inspiration.
to predict what this killer might do next, we have to understand what he's thinking and feeling.
Annie?
you're familiar with this case, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
could you help us out here, please?
wpc Cartwright has a BA in psychology.
now the victim wasn't gagged.
why didn't he gag her, Annie?
forget the mind-reading act.
let's get down to the strip-tease.
because he needed to...
he needed to see a mouth.
the lips.
we have to see the things that we value.
now put yourselves in the mind of this man.
you're lonely.
every night, you dream of this girl and she's got big eyes, and red, ruby lips.
so you go out and you find that girl, and you bring her home.
but you don't gag her, 'cause you want to see those ruby lips.
but you just can't bring yourself to kiss 'em.
you get embarrassed.
angry.
you'd start to blame the girl.
it's her fault.
she's taunting him just by being there.
and then one day, you just snap.
strangle her, using bootlace, and then the cycle starts all over again, with a different girl.
and this time, you're positive you're gonna be brave enough to kiss her.
only you won't be.
I look at your lips all the time, Cartwright.
d' you think I should turn myself in?
I think you'd better trot along now, sweetheart, before I have to hose this lot down.
thank you.
how would he keep her quiet without gagging her?
I don't know.
alright.
maybe this nutter moved to the area recently.
maybe he's on day release from the loony bin.
maybe there's a new face in the local boozers, let's find out, let's not wait for another skirt to wind up dead.
and let's just hope we haven't been led up a blind alley.
sorry sir, I've checked and there's no Maya Roy listed in that area.
then try the number again.
I have no Maya Roy listed.
well, just try again!
there's no need... - Forget it.
large whisky, please.
drink ain't gonna fix things.
what am I saying?
I run a pub!
of course it'll fix things!
I'm lost, Nelson.
really lost.
you're not lost, pal.
you're where you are
and you have to make the best of it.
it's all you can do.
keep it to yourself, eh?
folks just seem happier with the other Nelson.
good luck.
look at this. These are my notes from the real world.
I made them last night.
films. Music. Wars.
just check out the detail.
don't tell me. Atom bombs over Moscow.
discussing psychology with your little friend?
I want Chris out of the collators den. It's a waste of flipping time.
no it isn't.
sorry, did that sound like a question?
I can find this killer. - Do you know what?
I think you're trying to show me up.
you don't scare me, Hunt.
it's an interesting point you raise. Allow me to retort.
better?
where are you going?
I can't deal with this place.
so you're just giving up?
look...
somewhere out there, Maya needs me.
my mind can only invent so much detail, you know, so I'm gonna walk till I can't think up any more faces, or streets.
I mean, this is just...
just what?
this is madness.
I've got a nephew, and he fell off a pier, and he couldn't remember the name of things.
couldn't tell you what an apple was, or a pencil.
and you know what?
he stopped believing in them.
then he got better.
and everything seemed real again.
follow the yellow brick road.
and what will you find?
mist? A big cliff?
white door?
I don't know.
I used to come here!
I bought my first Gary Numan. Cars.
I'm gonna call DCI Hunt.
what's he gonna do?
throw me down the stairs?
say I walked into a door?
he doesn't want me around, and he doesn't need me.
and I certainly don't need him.
Sam?
what are you doing?
he doesn't gag 'em.
he doesn't gag 'em 'cause he wants to kiss 'em, but if they shout out, he's gonna get caught, in't'e, so what's he gonna do?
strands of material underneath their nails and on their skin.
but it's not wool.
it's rough. Synthetic.
I know where the fibres come from.
Soundproofing!
he's trying to muffle the room to hide the cries.
Dora Keynes' coat was found on rough ground, what, an hour ago?
Yes, guv.
sleeve was torn.
she was last seen shouting at some bloke loitering in the street, about 9. 40pm.
so, stuff the collators office, we need to get out on the street because by your reckoning, we only have a day to find her.
anything happens to this motor and I come over your houses and stamp on all your toys, got it?
good kids.
Hello, love. CID.
we're looking for this woman, Dora Keynes.
approximately 5'2 " , curly brown hair, hazel eyes, fake topaz necklace.
we're looking for a short skinny bird, wears a big coat, lots of gob.
excellent work, ladies and gentlemen.
hunt, what?
I need to speak... Tyler... told me to let him know... name from his list.
Chris, move about a bit.
tell DI Tyler we've found one of his names in the collator's office.
we've found one!
it's one of the names you asked me to find. Raimes.
I only found the carbon.
it's a statement she made three months ago.
woman in her fifties. Mrs. Raimes.
beryl Raimes.
you gave the name Colin Raimes, so I thought there was a connection.
Yeah. she's his grandmother.
Oh, that's lovely. What nice boys you are.
do you want a custard cream, Mrs. Raimes?
Ooh, ta. - Mrs. Raimes.
you made a complaint to the police, about three months ago?
I saw a lady policeman. Nice girl.
no life for them, is it?
you came to complain about a neighbour.
that's why we have a statement from you on file.
the only trouble is, we don't know who it was, or what it was about because our copy got smudged.
have you got Garibaldis? - Chris, Garibaldis!
it's only three months ago, Mrs. Raimes. Think back. Please. Think hard.
I forget stuff.
Mrs. Raimes, it's very important. It could be vital that you remember exactly why you came to see us three months ago.
was it a next-door neighbour who you were worried about, or somebody in your street, somebody visiting, someone upset you. They did something bad, or selfish, or dangerous.
please, come on, think.
pink wafers.
I love pink wafers.
you know, all of those packets of wafers you get at Christmas.
Ooh, they are lovely.
expensive, mind. - They are, aren't they?
I sometimes get them in for my grandson.
I bet that takes a bite out the housekeeping, eh?
Chris, run down the canteen, see if we've got any pink wafers.
now, guv?
hang on. Sorry, is this helping?
do you want another cuppa? - Grand.
don't you go worrying yourself about this neighbour business.
it's not important at all. Sugar, love?
the lad next door. Number twenty.
Oh yeah? What about him, my love?
Oh, he's playing his record player all night.
Bash! Crash! Bam! And he's not even local.
so that's why you came to see us.
to complain about the noise from his stereo.
it did the trick, pet. He still lives there, but you can't hear a thing now.
back-up to 20 Kemmel Road, now!
the suspect is an Edward Kramer.
we may need uniformed back-up, have you got that?!
you will tread carefully.
we don't even have a warrant yet.
pipe lagging.
Kramer! Police! - Whoa, what you doing?
Dora? Dora?
Dora, it's alright, it's police, we're the police, it's okay, love, we've got you.
Kramer, come here!
get inside, Colin.
that's Raimes' house.
Maya was right, he knew the killer.
we were one house away.
Kramer'll never go to trial, you know that, don't you?
he's certifiable. - Nah.
jury'll send that creature down forever.
this is a doctor's report. We found it in the house.
it says he is "seriously disturbed."
he's going to a high-security hospital.
what, and be mollycoddled, indulged, be a good boy, he'll be out in twenty years. He'll still only be forty odd.
you know as well as I do, he'll kill again.
hang on.
Oh my God.
that's why he doesn't kill for so long.
we put him away in hospital, he gets out in 30 years, and then he kills.
and then he kidnaps Maya.
what are you on about? Forget the bloody doctor's note.
if the jury know they're trying a cold-blooded killer, it's life.
look, listen, you told me you were a deputy to the law.
the law is putting bad people away and you wanna show a court that note?
fine. You got principles.
hang on.
what, you want another pop at me?
you wanna get me suspended? If you like, you can try your hand.
and as for this note, I'm making it your call.
welcome to the team.
Thanks. Guv.
I'll get the lights, love.
are you okay, sir?
Sam.
can you hear me?
my name is Neil. I'm a hypnotherapist.
I'm speaking directly to your subconscious.
at this moment, I'm sitting beside you in your bed, in the IC ward of St James's Hospital.
if I am reaching you...
and you can hear me, then I know that you can wake up.
I can hear you.
I'm in a coma, yeah?
you can help me.
whatever you may be experiencing isn't real, Sam.
you can escape.
you only need to take that definitive step.
do as I tell you and you will be waking up with your family and friends around you.
your mobile hasn't stopped ringing.
Maya is here.
Maya. - She's safe.
if you can hear me, I know that will give you strength.
I'm coming back.
you tell her.
I'm coming back.
Sam?
come away from the edge.
it's okay. I know the answer.
I'm in a coma.
I'm gonna take the definitive step I need to wake up.
Neil's my ex.
he did psychology with me.
I told him all about you.
he read all those notes you made.
there was nothing in those notes about a mobile phone.
what?
this is just my mind, trying to keep me here.
he's just playing games with you.
look down. Carefully!
please don't jump!
sorry! I'm sorry! Bad joke!
please, no, Sam, don't do it!
what you doing?!
we all feel like jumping sometimes, Sam.
only we don't.
me and you, because we're not cowards.
this is just my mind.
maybe you're here for a reason.
to make a difference.
gimme your hand.
what's that on your hands, is that grit?
sand.
I was running up here and I fell against the fire bucket.
see, why would I imagine that?
why would I bother to put that kind of detail in it?
you wouldn't.
what should I do, Annie?
stay.
air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities...
pan Am flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie.
he has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
this will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.
this relentless pursuit of terror.
we will make no distinction...
the USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
this was an act of terrorism.
it was a despicable and cowardly act.
the next samba we're going to swing for you is one of the good old favorites.
... until something stops him.
it was right in front of my eyes, and I never saw it coming.
that plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
thousands of people running.
we must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.
you're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person I've ever known.
I'm not the one who got it wrong.
I'm the only one who got it right.
take 'em.
take 'em all.
I spoke to the President yesterday.
he's exploring some changes in intelligence practice.
I won't temper my views just to get your support for my confirmation as Director.
I'm the one getting nominated as Director.
the Agency is being driven into the fucking ground.
the hope is that you are the reformer your record in the Senate would indicate.
so, then, you agree that change is in order?
Yes, I do. Is that Javadi?
in a French restaurant in Tehran with their wives.
we were young intelligence officers during the dying days of the Shah.
I watched the man I thought I knew become an animal.
so this operation is your revenge?
revenge was when I helped his wife and son escape to the West four months later.
I need your eyes on Carrie. We dangled her to draw the Iranians out.
Javadi himself. Carrie Mathison.
are we completely alone now? No one is listening.
it's time we talk about Nasser Hejazi.
whose name you used to embezzle more than $45 million dollars.
you are now an enemy of your own state. So why am I not arrested already?
saul would like to talk to you first. He will turn, won't he?
turning an intelligence officer against his own country.
well, that's the most delicate and uncertain work there is.
he wouldn't come with me right away. Said it wouldn't fly with his guys.
it was too risky. So I set a meet for later.
plan was to bring him straight here.
can I help you?
stop or I shoot. Now I'm ready to see Saul.
there's two fatalities and a lot of blood. It's a fucking bloodbath, Saul.
you got to get him out of there as fast as possible. And get the murder weapon.
what do we do about the baby?
leave it. You weren't there.
you don't look like a man who just landed the biggest asset of his career.
so, what are we looking for here? A. 22...
and the top half of this bottle.
plum wine.
Yeah, some kind of Iranian thing.
I thought Muslims didn't drink.
how many? What?
he hit her how many times?
I can see at least a dozen separate strikes.
honestly, though, with this... who the hell knows?
Cal? We're still looking for the murder weapons here, Cort.
I may have something better. Neighbor's security camera picked it up.
money is wired from the Al Askari Bank in Tehran the first Friday of every month to the HLBC subsidiary in Caracas.
on your signature there.
we have traced the funds downstream to a series of terrorist actions, including the attack on the CIA.
but also to your personal accounts where you've diverted nearly $50 million of Revolutionary Guard money.
that's punishable by death if the IRGC were to find out.
what's your point, Saul?
that I've been brought down by a girl?
by two girls?
enough.
I think he appreciates the situation.
he manipulates people. That's what he does. I know.
you can't let him get to you.
well, he does.
Where'd you find that one?
the list of outraged Iranian exiles is long.
she won't last.
well, that's what you said about me in 1976.
when we were both starting out.
so you got me.
are you proud of yourself?
so far.
I know what you want.
what's that?
to clean me of what I know.
I imagine the state of our nuclear weapons program is high on your list, huh?
there is a deal to be made.
or I'd be in prison by now.
if I talk...
if I do that,
I need protection.
I need a secure compound in Miami with a guard detail.
and I want my money unfrozen.
all of it.
is that everything?
for now.
so you've put some thought into this?
those are my terms.
okay.
those are your terms.
but the problem is you got it all wrong.
cause what I want from you is not just intelligence.
why do you think I went through the trouble of documenting your financial misdeeds?
Why?
you killed 219 Americans.
think I care you also ripped off the Revolutionary Guard?
I got plans for you.
much bigger than you spilling a few state secrets.
what plans?
I'm gonna play you back into Iran.
from now on, you work for us.
for me.
I'm your new case officer.
it won't work.
Why's that? You burned me back home.
how? - I'm here with you.
they don't know that. - Oh, they will.
who's going to tell them? Not me, not you.
you came here under your own steam.
however you managed that, your story's still intact.
and if I refuse to go?
so we're clear?
I'm sending you back to Tehran one way or the other.
either as my asset or a traitor to the Revolution.
was this always the plan? - Shh.
don't think I won't, Majid.
that's not a trial and quick execution you're facing there.
you'll be tortured first.
and I understand public hangings are back in vogue.
I will tell you everything you want to know, chapter and verse, but I can't go back.
you will do both. No, I won't.
Yes, you will. - No, I won't!
you're bleeding.
good afternoon.
Yeah. Rough night?
not especially. You look tired.
can I get you anything?
you've been MIA for days now.
not really.
I've been here.
you've been absent. Saul, too.
you care to shed any light on that?
talk to Saul.
like I said, he's not so easy to find.
you're my guy, Peter.
I recruited you. I brought you up.
what's your point? - My point is that entitles me to a certain amount of forthrightness.
from you.
there was a double murder earlier today in Bethesda.
Fariba Javadi, ex-wife of the Iranian Deputy Security Chief.
also her daughter-in-law.
I understand it was a damn slaughter.
would you like me to look into it for you?
fuck you.
that's outside the house where it happened.
2: 53 PM. You're the main suspect.
I hope they nail your ass to the wall.
Where's Saul? - In the interrogation room.
did you know we're sending Javadi back to Iran?
you missed the fireworks.
Javadi blew when he found out he had to go back. We're on hold till they stop the bleeding.
we better not wait too long. Shit.
I'm about to start again. What's the deal?
neighbor's security camera picked me up. There's an APB out.
just you? Yeah, somehow it missed Javadi and Carrie.
Where'd you get this? Dar Adal. He monitors the blotters.
so he knows Javadi's in the country? He knows something's up; he's not in on it.
I suggest you go talk to him soon.
I will. - I mean now.
he's furious. I'll smooth things over. In the meantime, you need to stay out of sight here in this building. We can't risk having you arrested.
fine, but what do we do about this? There's a police captain in Bethesda who owes me.
I could call him, at least get the photo down off the wire.
do it, face-to-face. Play the national security card.
tell him you have my full support.
what if he wants details about the murder?
he can't have them.
if anyone even suspects Javadi's in the country, we're through.
well?
I checked the whole house for surveillance. I must have missed the neighbors.
Yeah, well, I missed the whole fucking thing. How's it going in there?
slowly.
trouble? Oh, we'll manage.
you seem upset.
that's good enough.
well? Well what?
have you come to terms with your situation?
how does it work?
we return you to your people as soon as possible.
I assume they've arranged a way for you to get out of the country.
no, I meant about Fariba.
a crime is committed that must be covered up.
how does it work here?
you killed her.
Why?
get back at me because you could?
she was my wife. She was unfaithful.
she was your ex-wife. It was 35 years ago.
in the eyes of God, we're still married.
I should have stoned her to death, but you didn't give me enough time.
remember this?
it was Fariba's 21st birthday.
we talked all night, the four of us, about what the future might bring.
it wasn't this.
I thought we were meeting outside. My guys have a few questions.
you told them I can't talk about it, right?
Yeah, I told them.
detectives Johnson,
cort, Carrie Mathison.
okay, I understand you're not happy about this.
Oh, and you are? Of course not.
we're as upset as you.
so who's this guy? I'm afraid that's classified.
but he's one of yours? Well, that's classified, too.
can you tell me what he was doing here? That's...
can you tell me how he knew the victims?
okay, wait a second. - Can you tell me any goddamn thing at all?
can you tell me why this lady's laying here with her throat cut to ribbons?
any fucking thing?
excuse me.
okay, Cap?
you're not a fanatic. You're a pragmatist.
always have been.
don't tell me what I am and what I am not.
well, we're both old men. There's no disputing that.
we are.
it's the curse of old men to realize that in the end, we control nothing.
so we lash out.
buenos Aires, Berlin...
bergen.
these are small acts, Majid.
unworthy of you.
you left something out.
the bombing of the CIA.
nothing small about that.
nothing unworthy. Well, I wanted to talk about that, too.
I'm sure you do. Because when that bomb went off, killing all those people, many of them my friends, my first thought was not revenge.
it was...
something has to change.
you hit us, we hit you.
it's always the same.
and...
how does my going back as your spy change any of that?
for years, we toiled in back rooms, you and I.
we toiled while shallower men held the stage, waiting for our time to come, gradually understanding it never would.
now it has, unexpectedly.
for you, it has.
you're the one who made it possible.
I want to return the favor.
does this look like a favor to you, Saul?
majid, thanks to you, I stand at the center of things.
you put me in power.
you go back to Tehran, I'll do the same for you.
I know a way.
you all right?
Yeah, sorry. I don't know what happened there.
so are we okay? I wouldn't say so, no.
I'm sorry, but can't you handle that?
you mean, can't I just pull rank and shut this thing down?
sure, just like you try with me. But you know what happens next?
somehow that photo and all the evidence in this room show up on Drudge Report or goddamn Wikileaks, and then you've got yourself a real problem.
and don't look at me like I'm being less than helpful.
I'm just talking reality here.
so what do you suggest?
they want to talk to the guy in the photo.
that's impossible. - You want this thing closed quietly?
find a way.
Where's Quinn? Uh, outside, I think.
could you find him? Was it always the plan to send Javadi back to Iran?
it was always the hope. No one told me.
well, you should be proud. Your work made it all possible.
I'm not proud. What he did to this country, it's nothing compared to what he did to Iran.
we should try him for what he's done. - That's not the plan.
that's not the plan. Go find Quinn, please.
he's in. - Good.
how'd you make out? Not so well.
they want to talk to you- the local cops do.
you told them that was impossible, right? - Several times.
I thought your captain friend was gonna take care of this.
Yeah, me, too. He boned me.
the important thing here is to not jeopardize the Javadi play.
Agreed? So let me talk to them, the cops.
and say what? I don't know, see what they ask.
you know what they'll ask.
you're their only suspect, and since you can't tell them what actually happened, you'll be admitting to two murders and then saying they can't touch you for it.
okay.
look, we have police threatening to blow up our operation.
at the very least, this buys us enough time to get Javadi out of the country.
so unless you got another option? Do it.
at least let me go with him. No. Javadi came here to contact you.
you're the only one who can be seen with him. I need you to get him back to his people.
when? - Soon as possible.
you got to get him out of the country before anything else blows up, and you need to stay right by his side. We cannot risk another screwup, okay?
where will you be? - I got a meeting with Senator Lockhart, who's apparently noticed.
I haven't been at my office all week.
we need to keep this thing together until Javadi's on a plane heading back to Iran.
it's time. Carrie will take you back.
and what makes you sure I won't just vanish?
this way.
she'll be with you all the way to the plane.
I meant in Iran.
what I said before. You started this.
I think you'll want to be there when it ends.
I need to know something before you leave.
I need to know.
who was responsible for the bomb?
the bomb at Langley? Yes.
on the ground that day. Who was responsible?
I thought it was Brody. That's what you told the Senate.
that's what you told the entire world.
you have a manhunt on five continents, a $10 million reward...
did he do it? Yes or no.
I don't know. I don't believe you.
I don't... - Look me in the eye and answer.
it wasn't him.
it was one of Abu Nazir's guys.
who, exactly...
I didn't want to know.
we'll get you some clothes to change into.
then Carrie will take you back to your plane.
will you give me a sec? Yes, sir.
Saul? Where are you?
driving. Home?
no. Back to work.
I've been thinking about our days in Tehran.
Really?
that was... a long time ago.
Yep. We were so young.
I was so worried about you when it all went to hell.
about getting you out.
Yeah, no, I was... worried about you.
leaving you behind.
I said I didn't care about your friend from Mumbai, but I do.
I said I didn't have any claim on you.
Saul... But I do.
maybe it's just in my own mind at this point.
I don't know. But I needed to tell you before it's too late.
did you hear me? Yes.
it's the first time I could come up for air in nearly two days.
I wanted you to know.
when are you coming home?
usual.
not till late. Okay.
well, I'll see you then.
just follow the tags, and...
in there.
what's this? How we'll contact you.
memorize it. Also your cover story.
the information you pried out of me that justifies your coming here.
it's how we took down your network.
is it true? It's verifiable.
who is the source?
if I go to Iran, I'll have to take the traitor out.
you know that. The source is a hack we did, a computer virus that allowed us to monitor your communications.
you want to take it out, go ahead. We have you now.
it's time to go back to your people. You ready?
Yeah.
what were you planning to do, bypass me entirely?
I'm not going to apologize. I had to keep the circle small.
not that small. You, Carrie, Quinn.
and come to think of it, I haven't seen that headscarf for a while.
all need-to-know. I thought we trusted each other.
just you.
I tell just you. I don't see how.
you've got Lockhart waiting in your office.
you think he didn't notice that the ex-wife of the IRGC Chief got slaughtered in Bethesda?
or that Carrie, whom you committed to a psych ward, got out and you're doing shit about it?
he's the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, not some civilian fuck-monkey.
okay.
I do have something going. An operation...
and we're past that. It's time for details.
fine.
I'll tell you both.
you never told me whose idea it was.
to hang you out as bait.
was it your idea or Saul's?
that's all right.
you don't have to say. It was Saul's idea.
it had to be. In fact, it's classic Saul.
if it's so classic, why'd you fall for it? Why do you think?
it was you.
the abuse you went through.
what Saul did to you to get me here.
even I have never done anything so cruel.
you're forgetting I've seen your handiwork.
you can't bullshit me. I'm not bullshitting you.
then you're seriously deluded.
you know what he asked me? Why you killed your wife?
who moved the bomb. If it was Brody.
now, why would he ask me that?
that implies that there's a difference of opinion on that subject.
right?
What'd you tell him?
that it was one of Abu Nazir's guys.
not Brody?
no.
who?
someone else.
that's all I know.
you Peter Quinn?
uh, yeah.
what? That's a difficult question?
no. Cause your compadre Mathison, she promised what she called "Candor."
Peter Quinn is, uh...
what? My legal name.
uh, one of the victims, she was Iranian.
Yes.
ex-wife of an Iranian security guy... IRGC?
Yes. And the other victim, that's his daughter-in-law?
Yes. I assume that's significant.
right.
these are some terse responses.
look, can we just get on with this? "On with this"?
we are "On with it. " How are we not "On with it"?
my colleague led me to believe you were after a confession. Well, that's incorrect.
what I said was, I'm trying to understand what happened here.
that's not gonna be possible. Yeah, that's what she said.
she said all I need to know is that it's national security.
this is. This.
look, I know you think I'm just some dick jacking you up because I can, cause you were unlucky enough to get yourself photographed.
and maybe that's true, I don't know. But actually,
I'm just trying to understand this shit that you people do.
this shit that we're a party to cause we pay taxes.
this...
this shit.
so you killed the daughter?
Yes. With?
a Walther P22.
what about the mother? Same weapon?
no.
that was with a bottle.
plum wine.
for national security.
you fucking people.
have you ever done anything... but make things worse?
this is special access information.
fine.
it can't leave this room. Understood.
so?
I've recruited a high-level Iranian asset.
irgc Deputy Chief Majid Javadi.
Yes.
the man who financed the bombing of the CIA. That's right.
why on Earth would you trust him?
we've developed information that would compromise him with his own government;
evidence of wholesale corruption. Which, in Iran, just means it's Tuesday.
normally I'd agree.
but this is tens of millions of dollars siphoned from a secret IRGC fund designated for terrorist activities.
no one would look the other way. So you blackmailed him.
that's right.
is there some reason you didn't tell my Committee? I was waiting for it to be real.
it wasn't because this is just the kind of human intelligence nonsense that led to disaster right here in this building not four months ago?
believing our sworn enemies will magically switch sides.
we talked about this, the need to wean you of your cold war bullshit.
we agreed to disagree. I don't see it that way, not when I'm inheriting your mess in ten days.
a mess.
that's what you call placing a major asset inside a government that's been a black box for 30 years?
you asked me what I've been doing.
I told you.
are we done?
not by a long shot.
I want to know how this happened.
almost there.
almost there and you still haven't asked.
what? Who moved the bomb.
you told Saul it was one of Abu Nazir's guys.
Yes, I did. Which I already knew.
and who handed him the keys?
don't tell me you never wondered.
I bet you wonder all the time.
Brody escaped the blast.
did he know it was coming?
maybe I already know the answer to that.
maybe you don't.
fine. I guess you don't want the truth.
I do. I just don't think I'd get it from you.
okay.
I want to know about the wife. What about her?
you recruit Javadi, his wife's suddenly dead along with the daughter-in-law.
don't tell me that's a coincidence. It's not.
so who did it?
you know, every time you answer a question with a big, gaping nothing, it reminds me what a problem we have, you and I.
it was Javadi.
wait a second. You're saying he was in this country?
that's right. And you knew this?
we lured him here. Carrie did.
so, wait.
you two...
you were working together.
even when you were denouncing her in front of my Committee.
all for show.
did you know?
I'm learning it now with you. Well, who did know?
everyone who needed to.
no, everyone who needed to didn't know, because two of those people are in this room right now holding their dicks. I want Carrie brought in... now.
she can't come here now. And why is that?
she's busy. She's putting Javadi on a plane back to Iran. He's still here?
ground the fucking plane.
no. - Ground it.
I'm Acting Director for another two weeks. It's not your call.
I'll bump this up to the President, I swear to God. Then what?
we fry Javadi's ass publicly.
well, that's shortsighted. It's justice.
it's ineffective... cause back in Tehran, he's replaced by someone just like him who we can't control.
and the attack that happened here happens again and again and again.
this is a once-in-a-lifetime operation that can transform everything.
the entire Middle East. You sound like you're fucking high.
I'm calling the President.
did you hear what I said?
I'm calling him. Get me a goddamn phone.
fine.
here.
destroy everything we've been working for. I'm not even going to dignify that with a response.
you really don't get it, do you? - You know what?
for the first time, I think I really do.
I see now why this place has been a fucking clown act for decades. How does this work?
I'm not sure.
and don't worry. I'll handle the President.
open the door.
no. Open the goddamned door.
make me.
dar, let me out of here.
you're dead. Both of you son...
what the fuck?
well, you had your chance.
wait!
it's okay.
you said you'd tell me the truth. And you told me I was incapable.
you might be right.
but if you want to talk to someone you can trust...
who was there, you should know that the man who built the bomb and moved the SUV...
he didn't die in the explosion like they say.
as far as I know, he's still in this country.
where? I don't know.
who does? Someone you've already met.
the man that brought us together.
your lawyer? Bennett?
no. The way this worked out, believe me, he's not my lawyer anymore.
you requested radar following on Three Six Oscar?
Yes.
that aircraft cleared US airspace at 2219 hours.
thank you. Yes, sir.
an audacious operation.
just the beginning.
here's to continued success.
you know, I do need to apologize...
for excluding you.
you don't have to explain yourself, Saul.
you are the goddamn Acting Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
for ten more days.
senator Lockhart managed to get himself stuck in the conference room.
could you ask facilities to let him out?
how'd it go? They're standing down.
so it went well.
what do they say, confession is good for the soul?
only you didn't do it.
I know.
but it made me feel better.
wrong crime, right guy, I guess.
you know what else I realized?
just how through I am with...
this, the CIA.
I just do not believe anymore.
believe what?
that anything justifies the damage we do.
you can't quit yet.
Javadi's out over the Atlantic heading home.
and he told me something before he left... about the Langley bomber.
you mean Brody. No, that's just it.
it's not him, and I can prove it now.
but...
I need your help.
sure, Carrie.
whatever you need.
how-how was your day?
had a good day.
actually a really good day.
forgive me.
for what?
I'd forgotten...
how beautiful you are.
they served a search warrant - Make them get out.
I can't. You're person of interest in a murder investigation.
you're a cop now?
I was... Not expecting that.
me neither.
I had an amazing time last night, And I would really like to keep seeing you.
like this? Always in the middle of nowhere?
so who is it? Somebody new? Somebody I know?
I think I'm gonna have to start looking in the hallways to see if I can guess who it is.
you were spying on me, the whole time.
not the whole time.
don't touch me.
they found some fibers... Some threads caught in a bracelet.
the one alison gave us?
I think someone's going to a great deal of trouble To make you look guilty.
do you think somebody rubbed that sweater on your bracelet?
somebody? Try ian.
he's doing everything he can to make you look guilty.
your parents should hire you a 24-hour bodyguard.
what about jenna?
what if she paid caleb to get that bracelet?
when was caleb in spencer's house?
he doesn't need an invitation, em. He broke into a vending machine with a spork.
guys... I think somebody's watching us.
those? They're for the founders festival.
man, if that's what rosewood's founding family looked like,
how did they ever get anyone to move here?
and why were they allowed to reproduce?
guys, if caleb was - Could we stop using the "c" word?
we know this is hard for you, okay, But we have to talk about ca-- him.
if we want to help spencer, We have to know what caleb knows.
guys, there is definitely somebody out there.
maybe if emily and I cornered caleb-- Not in school, but somewhere that's jenna-free.
if caleb's gonna talk to anyone, it's gonna be me.
will you do it?
to help spencer, sure.
Thanks, hanna.
Spencer? Are you coming? - Yeah.
what's the purple one?
s sugar than soda. Folic acid.
Dr. Barone's new nurse chatted my ear off about it.
really just an excuse so she could ask questions about our family.
what kind of questions?
mom, everyone in town's talking about us.
the bracelet, The police marching out of here with bags.
what did you say, to this nurse? - Nothing.
but you know the second I left,
she probably told the others that spencer was gonna be Wearing handcuffs at my baby shower.
morning, sweetie. You want some yogurt?
I have-- I have fresh berries.
no. I already ate, thanks.
what were you talking about?
the founders festival.
your sister and ian are thinking of helping Mrs. Ackard with the church booth.
fun.
actually, I'd like you to join them.
you get on Mrs. Ackard's good side, And no one in town would...
why do I need to be on her good side?
because people are talking And jumping to a lot of conclusions.
it's toby.
honey, I'd prefer it if you'd not have any contact with him Until this situation is behind us.
Why? What does toby have to do with anything? He's a friend.
you need to be careful about who you associate with.
so, what? I'm just supposed to ignore him, not speak to him?
Yes. Sweetie, listen to me.
you need to be at the festival.
if you're not, your neighbors are gonna think You have something to hide.
I don't really care what my neighbors think.
they're not just neighbors, spencer, They're potential jurors.
and most verdicts are decided in living rooms, And town fairs.
just take toby out of that equation, okay?
good morning.
so... I have a meeting tonight,
but do you want to wait so we can have dinner together and...?
I'll grab something after school.
okay.
did... Caleb move back in with his foster family?
do you want to tell me why he moved out so quickly?
there's... Nothing to tell.
look, if you would rather stay home from school, Have a mental health day...
knock-knock.
in here, mona.
morning, mrs. M. - Hi.
can I steal some of that coffee? - Sure.
is sketchy-boy gone for good?
Yes, mona, he's gone.
you ready? - Hanna, could I just say something?
this is all my fault. - What?
I knew he was gonna disappoint you in a major way,
and I blame myself for not stepping up to protect you.
Mona. - No, I mean it.
a big part of me never trusted him, And if I'd been a better friend,
I would have told him to get lost Before he unzipped his ready duffle bag.
I hate seeing you get hurt. - Well, I'm not hurt.
can we go?
got a second?
um... Sure.
look, I don't know what hanna's told you... - Everything.
she's my best friend. - Then maybe you can help me.
she's having a hard time hearing how sorry I am.
she won't take my calls, She looks the other way whenever I see her. - Caleb.
have this conversation with hanna, okay?
what are you doing?
I got 'em. I got the tickets.
no way!
I thought they were sold out.
my dad knows somebody at hollis who works for college events.
that's awesome. How much was it?
my treat. Isn't that why they call it a date?
those tickets were expensive.
em, I can handle two tickets.
Troy sattler will pay for his own.
wait. Troy sattler's coming too?
Emily, you know I want to be alone with you,
but I got the tickets from my dad, And I just thought if a guy came along...
I'm not pretending to date troy.
he's just, like, insurance.
look, I really want to have that talk with my dad. I do.
I even went online and looked for, like, what to say.
you're gonna come out to your parents through e-mail?
no.
Sheridan prep has a campus pride group, With a website.
it's not like I can go to a meeting, though. Their school is, like, two miles from here.
then meet someone from the group for a coffee.
would it help if I went with you?
Hey. - Hi.
so, can we talk about this weekend, the festival?
I was think-- - Oh, god! I am so sorry. Did I do that?
um... Sorry.
look, how do you feel about a stay-at-home weekend instead, Your place, with me?
Yeah. What's going on?
Oh, did I get it on your shoes? I am such a spaz!
look, we can just talk about it later.
sure. My classroom, after school.
no, we can't. Can we just do this over dinner?
sure.
mind if I join you? - Uh... No. I mean, yes, please.
so, we're talking?
what does jenna want?
why was she willing to pay you to live in my basement?
I told you, I gave the money back.
what did she ask you to do? Record our conversations?
rifle through my purse, The drawers in my bedroom?
what does she want?
a key.
she offered me a lot of money to look for a key.
a key to what, my house?
I gave you that.
no. She thinks that your friend, the one who died, may have give you or one of your girls a key.
ali didn't die, she was murdered.
what kind of key? - Jenna didn't know.
and as soon as I realized something was happening between you and me,
I told her to back off.
Hanna, what's with you guys and jenna cavanaugh?
why did she need me?
why couldn't she just ask you directly?
you know what? You don't get to ask questions.
what else?
if I knew more, so would you.
I miss you.
Yeah. You'll get over it.
okay, I'm back. - Hey, is fitz there?
no, he got pulled into some faculty thing,
so he texted me to order some food.
so you guys are still texting?
Wow. I would have thought after that thing with your mom...
he doesn't know about that.
if he thinks my parents are sniffing us out, It'll just make him paranoid, not romantic.
Yeah, tell me about it.
I still don't know if toby thinks I set him up with that sweater.
wait, you haven't talked to him yet?
no.
he left me a message Saying that he couldn't meet me after school.
I gotta go. My mom's calling. - Okay. Bye.
Hello? - Hey, it's me.
uh, yeah, this meeting's Running a bit long.
did you order dinner yet?
um... You know what? I-I can't stay.
is something wrong?
no, no. Um, we'll just-- we'll talk later, okay?
okay.
that's what I said.
was it a key to ali's house? Her locker at the tennis club?
why would jenna want that? What was she gonna do, sniff ali's old sweat socks?
if jenna's "a," she's looking for Any information on us she can get.
I cannot believe that he went through my closet and my nightstand. What a jerk!
he's a total creep. - He's an animal.
easy, guys.
he looked through your stuff, he didn't invade poland.
why are you sticking up for him? He broke her trust.
he went behind her back.
he stuck his hands in her panty drawer!
I'm sorry.
okay, all I'm saying is that somebody can look through someone else's stuff that they're not supposed to be looking through.
you wanna translate that into speech?
I saw ezra's website page.
look, I-I knocked his desk, and his laptop screen came up.
so, big deal.
what's the juiciest thing on his status update?
Ezra fits has joined the mark twain fan page"?
how 'bout he has a double life.
wait, I thought that you were his double life.
fine. Triple life.
there was this picture of him cozying up to some girl wearing an engagement ring in Italy.
what's her name? - Jackie.
how do you know she wasn't his cousin?
cause in picture number three, They were licking each other's gelato.
I mean, guys, seriously, what do I do?
be honest with him.
explain what happened and see what he says.
Yeah, and remember, people can look guilty of something even if they're completely innocent.
okay, you know what? Screw that.
make a fake profile,"friend" jackie, comb through that skank's page, and nail his ass to the wall.
or we can do what emily says.
Hey. How are you? - Relieved...That you're speaking to me.
I wasn't sure if you'd heard the cops' theory About me planting evidence.
we shouldn't talk about this.
so you do think it was me?
no, of course not.
but I can't say the same for my family.
Spencer, you should go home.
those guys have a way of adding two and two And coming up with five.
I'll stop by your place later.
um, I'm not sure that that's such a good idea.
why not?
because your parents don't want you near me?
makes sense.
how 'bout the festival?
maybe we could meet up behind a tent, Or the funhouse.
seven o'clock?
Toby. I need you to drive me to school. I have a make-up test.
okay, just... Let me get cleaned up.
Hey, spencer.
uh... How's it goin'? - You tell me, garrett.
I thought you were on our side.
I don't get to have personal feelings When I'm in uniform.
well, if you put on a pair of jeans, This would be called stalking.
Spencer, look. If being trailed is gonna help clear your name, better it's me than someone who thinks you're guilty.
Hey, are you paige?
what? Oh, no. I'm emily, her friend.
are you...? - Samara.
I go to sheridan prep. Member of the campus pride group.
did your friend tell you?
Yeah. Sorry. Didn't realize you'd be so...Punctual.
okay, so even though we can't see her profile, Jackie and mr. Fitz - Ezra.
went to the same college.
so I looked up alumni and punched in random names until I found a girl who already didn't have a page.
Tonya freeman? - Yep.
who's that? - Who cares?
this is starting to feel so wrong.
Hey, it's so not.
look, I don't want what happened to me to happen to you.
fool me once, shame on you, and fool my best friend, you're dead-frickin'-meat.
hm, that's... Tender.
but what about a profile picture?
Oh, we're not putting one up.
okay, if the profile is faceless, Jackie will assume it was someone she used to be friends with, feel guilty she forgot they exist, And accept the friend request.
well, jackie is about to be reunited With one of her old pals.
you do the honors, tonya.
Aria, do you want to know the truth or not?
Emily, not to be rude, but...Is there a friend? - What?
look, if you made it this far, you're doing great.
Oh, no, no. It's not me.
this is about paige, Someone I'm starting to date.
that's why this sucks. Feels like it's a step back for me.
I get it.
I was with a closeted girl when I first moved here. Nothing but drama.
I start to realize that if it was meant to be, it shouldn't be this hard.
something tells me she's not coming. - I'm sorry.
it's okay. I had to be in the neighborhood anyway.
I'm setting up a booth at the festival.
me and some friends from art class are selling handmade jewelry.
that's cute. Did you make that?
Yeah. Thanks.
Hey, if you want to see more, you should come by early, Get the first choice.
are you free tomorrow morning?
Aw, cute.
did you come up with that yourself, mrs. Ackard?
well, if you want people to cough up money, You'd better make 'em smile.
okay, we're good.
that tent's not coming down anytime soon.
Oh, we feel safe in your hands, ian.
shame on you two for not having a church wedding in rosewood.
well, we plan on making up for it.
our baby's gonna have the biggest christening this town's ever seen.
Oh, good! We need as many joyous events as possible.
this town still hasn't recovered since alison's...
Oh. Me and my loose lips. I'm sorry.
no, it's okay, mrs. Ackard.
under the circumstances, Spencer's doing really well.
Ian, before I forget, the reverend and I are planning a golf trip,
but we can't decide between pebble beach, Kaanapali, hilton head...
Ooh! Ian knows all about hilton head.
Oh, have you been there?
Yeah. Um... I only played there once, but it was a dream.
and did you stay there too?
Yeah, um... and make sure you get a room overlooking the ninth hole, right, hon?
definitely. The room's got an amazing ocean view.
Oh, really?
the brochure says that the golf course and the ocean are on opposite sides of the hotel.
Oh, no, that's right. Um, I was thinking about the view from the hotel restaurant.
what do you think you're doing?
Oh, ian, could you help me with this box out to the booth, please?
Ah, yes, ma'am. Of course.
so, did you tell the police that you stayed on opposite sides of the hotel, or were you even at hilton head?
did you make these?
not to toot my own horn, but...Toot-toot!
they look... Amazing with your skin tone.
you should have them.
you don't have to give them to me.
okay, steal them. I'll turn around.
Hi. - Hi.
uh, paige, this is samara from sheridan prep, who you were supposed to meet at the grille.
Oh. Hi. - Hi.
look, if you ever want to reschedule, Grab a coffee, talk about your dad, emily has my cell.
um... Tell your friend how hot she looks in those earrings.
Oh, hey, mrs. Marin. - Hanna's not here.
she's, um... Setting up for the festival.
what's in the bag? - Screwdriver.
I accidentally packed it.
I didn't want you to think I made off with your stuff.
so where are you staying?
well, for the next few nights, on a bus, On my way to arizona.
does hanna know you're leaving?
I don't expect her or you To throw me a going-away party.
all I know is my daughter's sitting in a dark room Listening to elliott smith on a loop.
I don't know what happened between you two. - Would it matter?
you were never really my biggest fan.
that's because I didn't want to see my daughter Listening to elliott smith on a loop.
I'm not judging. I think she's lucky.
maybe if I had a mom like you, I wouldn't be sleeping on a bus and making up the rules as I go along.
can you give this to her?
you should go to the festival and give it to her yourself.
Hanna doesn't need one more guy in her life Leaving without saying goodbye.
what did you tell her... About me? - Nothing.
I told her you were dealing with stuff, - You were scared your parents would... - I wish you hadn't done that.
if I didn't show up, there was a reason.
Hey. The second you guys left, everybody suddenly got thirsty.
uh, here, for the earrings.
look, paige, I hope it didn't seem like I was calling you out.
I get it. We've all been there.
I know you're trying to be nice and everything, but, honestly, you don't even know me.
Paige! - What?
sorry, emily, I'm not looking to join a club and ride down main street on a rainbow chopper.
actually, I drive a jeep.
but that's beside the point.
you know what? I'm gonna take this to go. I've got a paper that's due.
tell your friends it was really nice to meet them.
Emily, wait. - What?
so you can be rude to me too?
you know what, paige? This is becoming way too much drama.
I don't want to be your secret.
Mona. Thought you were gonna help.
I am helping.
I'm making sure you don't Host a pity party for yourself and invite a cheesecake.
um, don't look now, but sketchy is at 12: 00.
I-I cannot deal with him right now. Just don't tell him I'm here.
we're not open for business yet. - I know.
Hanna's mom said that - She had to step out.
any idea when she'll be back?
probably when you leave.
you really hurt her, caleb.
make sure she gets this.
what did he want? - Change for a twenty.
can you help me with the tape?
I LOVE YOU HANNA - Hey. We've been looking for you. - Why?
did the reverend's wife start to see through your act too?
when are you gonna learn to just keep quiet? - Get away from me.
you know, every time you try to bring me down, you end up in trouble.
and you know what they say about quicksand, spence.
the more you struggle, the faster you sink.
and you're sinking fast.
So...Runaway bride, top-secret affair, all five seasons of big love.
I sense a theme here.
you trying to tell me something?
Yeah. I guess I am.
but after I do, You have to tell me something.
okay.
Friday...When-- when I got here before you,
I... I saw a photo on your website page of you... And jackie.
I wasn't looking for it, okay?
I was hunting down your menus and the photo popped up, And...
I couldn't help but notice How happy the two of you were.
and, oh, did I mention a ring? Because she was wearing a ring.
look, ezra, I am not coming From some freaky, jealous place, okay?
I mean, maybe I was when I picked out big love, but, honestly...
I-I just feel like you know everything about me, and I don't feel like you've shared as much.
please jump in at any time.
I... Uh... I met jackie my freshman year in the dorm.
we saw each other on and off for about two years.
good. I need more.
she was the first really serious girlfriend I ever had.
I dated other people, but none of them were her.
so, when we got back together, I... I proposed.
that picture was taken in florence.
I bought the ring on the ponte vecchio.
my brother had to wire me the money.
I didn't even tell him what it was for.
Why?
cause I wasn't sure what her answer would be.
so... You were married?
no. No, it never happened.
Oh. Why did you break it off?
I didn't. She did.
Oh. Fitz, why hasn't she taken down that photo?
Oh, I don't know.
guess it was a great summer with lots of memories she wants to hold on to.
and what about you?
Aria, that's her photo, not mine.
but if she hadn't given you back that ring, you'd be married to her right now.
possibly.
and you've never told me this because...
I guess I'm one of those people that doesn't put things that didn't work out on my r
what's... what's bothering you more-- That old photo being out there, or... The fact that you and I can't take a picture like that?
Aria. That was then. You're very much now.
Hey, sweetie, how's it going? - Good.
did caleb come by? - Nope. Haven't seen him.
he came by the house. I think he wanted to say goodbye.
he's leaving rosewood.
he is? - Yeah.
well... Good riddance.
look, you called it, mom. Some bad boys are just that. Bad.
the thing is, I was wrong.
but if it makes a difference, My first impression of him was way off.
what are you seeing now that you didn't see before?
myself.
can u call me?
poor Em, You definitely have a type: Love me, lie for me.
I brought you a present back from my trip,
but you have to keep it a secret.
I didn't bring anything back for the other girls,
so if they ask about it, you have to lie.
promise?
it's beautiful. It's vintage. My grandma gave it to me.
I wanted you to have it.
you're the only one that really understands me, em,
the only one that I can completely be honest with.
I have to go. I have a prior engagement.
we'll definitely see you later, right? - Yeah.
don't have any fun without me.
make sure you keep that in a safe place.
it's a lot more valuable than it looks.
Raymond PLUS STORAGE
what happened?
here, put that over your head.
are you gonna torture me 'cause I gave somebody else a ring?
Aria, seriously, it wasn't even a karat.
get in the bag, mr. Fitz. We're taking a picture as a couple.
you know this is nuts, right?
are we done? I can't breathe.
time out.
I think I found the key. Call me now.
I have to leave.- N-now?
are you coming back?
um... I-I don't know. I might. I'll call you. Love you.
you too.
Hey, em, it's me. I'm on my way.
borrowed phone, Mine died. I'm inside
big and tall, young and old, all ages. Anything you got.
come on in. Come on in, guys, only two tickets each.
how do you get out of here?
which way should we go?
is it up here?
are you in here?
Hey, guys, wait for me!
having ANY FUN YET?
shut UP OR I'LL SHUT YOU UP -A
Toby, where are you?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
can somebody please help me?
Hey, can somebody hear me?
why didn't you answer your phone?
I left it at the booth.
you didn't get emily's text?
she found the key, the key that jenna was looking for.
she wants us to meet her at that storage place near hollis.
Where's spencer?
I couldn't reach her. Hopefully, she's on the way.
somebody please open this!
Hello?!
please open the door!
Hello? Please?
Mr. Fitz. I'm sorry to disturb you.
I'm garrett reynolds with the rosewood police. You got a minute?
sure. What can I do for you?
may I come in? - Yes, please.
excuse the mess.
what is this regarding?
I'd like to talk to you about one of your students.
Hello, please!
why isn't she answering?
I have no idea.
is he going somewhere?
I don't know.
Arizona. Who cares?
go over there and say something. Go... Before he does.
I can't.
now, come on. Emily's waiting for us.
sir. - Oh, thank you.
Toby, is that you?
Ian? Yeah, I've got her! She's fine.
Oh, honey, are you okay?
you needed a crowbar to get her out?
it's what was keeping her in.
somebody jammed the door with it.
I'm here. Where can I find you?
nobody else comes in here until you figure this out.
my sister-in-law could have been seriously hurt.
come on, girls, let's cut through here.
guys, look.
what is that?
that's ali's old lunchbox from when she was a kid.
what is that?
I don't know, but we're taking it. - Hanna, wait.
wait for what? For someone else to take it?
someone's been spying on us for years.
and ali didn't take the video. She's in it.
she's in a lot of 'em.
Oh, my god, that's July 4th.
she always said it was toby peeping on us.
no, there's no way that this is toby.
well, then, who is it?
how 'bout why?
why did alison have these videos?
did the person who took this know she had them?
is this why she was killed?
insufficient Funds
you got any toys?
don't fool with me! You hear me? Open it up!
all right, all right! - Get out the money!
come on! - Man, it's jammed!
stop stalling, man! Stop...Don't you fool with me!
it's okay, I got it, I got it. I got the safe right here, man!
don't you fool with me, man! I'll blast your ass!
Gimme... Gimme the damn money!
Oh, my God. You were in a robbery? Where are you?
at a police station.
I was the only one who saw the robbery. I didn't want you to worry.
Yeah, I'll call you back, honey. Someone's here.
Yeah, please call me back. - Yes. Bye.
it's okay if you want to finish your call.
no, I did. It's the wife, you know. - yeah, I know.
I'm Cary Agos with the State's Attorney's office.
I wanted to thank you for helping us out here.
no problem.
why don't we talk in private? This is kind of a noisy room.
so, we may need you around for trial, Mr. Dolan.
you, uh, found a suspect?
no, no, but if we do, we'll need you around for trial.
were you planning on going anywhere?
me? No. Why?
just you and your wife applied for passports last week.
right.
pretty pricey?
no. No, it's, uh, it's my in-laws.
in-laws.
so...
you told the officer you didn't touch anything in the store, and you were just looking for a squirt gun for your son.
it's his birthday today. Why?
well, it's just...
the police, they dusted for prints, and they found yours on this display here.
Ah, yes.
when I entered the store, I,um,
I was looking at some of the greeting cards.
so you did touch something.
the display, yes. Why?
just trying to figure out what happened.
so you wanted to buy a greeting card, not a toy?
no, I-I wanted to buy a toy. - So why did you touch the cards?
is-is there something wrong?
I don't think so. Is there?
I think I'd like to leave now.
I'm afraid I can't allow that, Mr. Dolan.
Why?
we're holding you for investigation.
Mr. Dolan, I'm Alicia Florrick.
are you the public defender?
no, I'm registered with the City Bar's Pro Bono Program.
they referred your case. But if you'd prefer a public defender.
no. This is crazy. - I know.
I saw a robbery and they think because my fingerprints were on a display that was thrown down, that I did it.
well, actually, Mr. Dolan, the police have an eyewitness who saw you struggle with the clerk and shoot him.
that's not true. I don't...
okay, listen, don't say a word to anyone. Okay?
will you call my wife? They took my cell.
actually, don't call her. I'll call her.
okay.
so are you following me now?
just going where the pro bonos take me, Cary.
I don't suppose you'd let me question him more.
I mean, he's innocent, right?
thank you, Mr. Boylan. Are you ready?
I guess I am. - Okay, send the first one.
you take all the time you want.
hello.
may I help you? - No, I'm good.
there's going to be five total.
all right, walk to the line.
turn to your left.
touch the wall.
and turn back.
no. Not him.
send in number two.
walk to the line.
were you wearing those glasses when you saw the murder?
Yeah.
turn to your left.
no, definitely not. He was much thinner than that.
okay, send in number three.
number three, step forward.
stop on the line.
look in the lens.
don't move.
that's him.
are you sure?
that's the man you saw struggling with the cashier, and firing two bullets into his head?
Yes. Definitely.
head back in, number three. Thank you.
Travis Dolan, an unemployed former Parks employee.
he's broke, about to be evicted.
he's Mr. Everyman, except this Everyman walks into a convenience store to rob it.
doesn't count on the cashier having a gun.
shoots him, kills him.
sees a passing patrol car pulling up.
puts his gun down, hides in the back of the store, pretending to be a witness.
prints on the gun?
no usable prints, but a solid eyewitness.
no cash taken?
didn't have time.
the patrol car surprised him.
there was a struggle, right?
during the commission of a robbery.
you want second degree?
offer second degree, I'll take it to him.
once again, I look for my liaison, but where is she?
and once again, I have a job that sometimes takes me, oddly, out of the office.
so what, I handle this meeting on my own, is that it?
you do. You're a big boy, Eli. And Will and Diane don't bite.
Yeah, it's not them I'm worried about.
okay, so here's my advice, Eli: don't bite them. Okay?
always the level headed one.
okay. I need you to work with me full-time.
Really? - Yes.
I need investigator time.
the law moves slow; I move fast.
I'm managing three campaign crises right now, and the cheese lobby has just taken me on full-time.
Yes, the cheese lobby.
you're fast, you're a pro. I need you full-time.
they won't let me be full-time.
that's why I'm telling them.
I don't like sharing.
and between you and me, and whoever else you tell once I ask you
I need someone as investigator when I leave here.
for opposition research.
that's not going to happen.
it is going to happen, because I'm going to make it worth your while.
more money, more power, more self-reliance.
Hello, Eli. How are you? - Great. Good.
will, how are you? - I'm good, Eli. Always a pleasure.
Julius Cain, head of litigation. - Nice to meet you.
so, I've hit the ground running, as I'm sure you're well aware, and now I think it's time to take a breath and reassess.
No! Ten minutes!
and I need both Alicia Florrick and Kalinda
what's your last name again? - Sharma.
sharma, dedicated to my department full-time.
lobbying and crisis management are a 24/7 business, and I need 24/7 dedication.
no.
anything else?
am I making you money? - You are.
am I encouraging clients to keep political business in-house?
you are.
then I can't be splitting Alicia and Kalinda's time with Legal.
Alicia is supossed to be at this meeting. Where is she?
she's on a case, a case that makes us money.
why don't we discuss this, Eli?
we take your concerns very seriously.
he'll stay because it's in his interest to stay.
it's only in his interest to stay if we encourage cooperation.
he doesn't want cooperation. - Look at the numbers, Will.
the dairy people bring in almost a as much as we lost last year.
but at what cost? If we dedicate Alicia to Eli,
what are we pulling them from? How much money are we losing?
well actually, at the moment Alicia is working on a pro bono.
okay, why are we still doing pro bonos?
because we're still a member of...
and why am I the only one who's worried about the economy?
we are heading into a double-dip recession without a bankruptcy department, without tax lawyers, and our lawyers, some of our best lawyers, are busy doing pro bono?
I need to talk to you. - About?
things.
the players. The political crosscurrents.
Really? You seem smart enough to figure that out.
I'm smart enough to know I need your help figuring it out.
we've expanded, Will, beyond our means.
Yes, we're one of the few all-service firms left standing, but we did it at a cost, and we can't continue this way.
what way? - We need bankruptcy.
if there's one department that'll survive a double-dip recession, it's bankruptcy.
to build one from the ground up would take time, but luckily enough, we can acquire one off the shelf.
how?
there's a firm breaking up:
malpractice is going one way, acquisition another, bankruptcy, I just found out, is going with litigation.
no. - Yes.
you need to talk to her. - We already said no.
we already said no when we thought it was just litigation.
if it's litigation and bankruptcy...
then you talk to her. - No.
everybody's going to be vying for her bankruptcy department.
we need someone who has a preexisting relationship.
I don't even know where she is.
the Midwest Bar Association.
Celeste Serrano is doing a seminar in Dispute Resolution.
get us bankruptcy, and we won't have to dance to the tune of Eli Gold.
have you noticed, no matter how high we go, we're still dancing to someone's tune?
welcome to leadership.
I don't want to see any lawyers pushing off their CLE hours.
guess who's in town? The Midwest Bar Association.
that's right. That's right. Just get it over with.
I have one more item I want to talk about.
the Department of Justice has identified certain
and I'll use their word-- "biases" in how we plea bargain.
so I've agreed to the government's request to detail an AUSA to this office.
not to monitor us, but to work with us, and be as one of us.
so please welcome Imani Stonehouse. Imani.
hello.
you're all under arrest.
okay, let's get going.
Imani, I'd like you to meet Cary Agos.
he'll be showing you the ropes.
he already has. Maximum sentence to a black drug dealer.
discount to a white killer.
okay. We're off to a great start.
the white defendant-- he had no priors.
and no crack.
Oh, yeah. Yep, you got me there.
big bad white prosecutor out to put down the black man.
and black woman.
will Gardner. What the hell are you doing here?
I've got 30 hours of CLE like everyone else.
well, come on up to the 34th floor if you want to continue that legal education.
strippers and Acquisitions.
maybe later.
the Globalization of Crime
so, um...
based on this, um, I believe, um...
it's not just, uh...
should have known you'd be here.
he's amazing, isn't he?
the criminal mind...
Yeah.
you always hated him. - Nope.
just thought he was a bad boss.
you were jealous.
of...?
you did not.
after the staff meeting on 9/11. Remember? He was in tears.
you slept with him?
we didn't do much sleeping.
Oh, oh, okay, you can stop now.
you found out it wasn't only litigation.
the bankruptcy is coming with me.
so you here to charm me? - To offer you a home.
and what about your lawyer friend Alicia Florrick?
why isn't she here to charm me, too?
what are you looking for?
to come to Lockhart/Gardner?
a three-year commitment to litigation.
come on.
and a five percent bump in salary and a 50/50 split on the Hammett Aerospace.
the jetliner crash? No.
Mr. Osterman. Remember me? Celeste.
Yes. How are you? - In Baltimore?
Oh, my goodness, yes. Excuse me.
a three-year commitment to litigation, a five percent bump in salary and we'll call it a day.
we have other suitors. - I'll talk to Diane.
until the economy improves, we're calling a halt to pro bonos.
plead out the ones you've got, then we need everyone full-time, back in the office.
Cary's resisting a plea.
what's on the table? - Second degree. 20 years.
for a murder with an eyewitness? Sounds like a worthy offer.
the client's resisting.
okay, I'll help out there. You want me to talk to Legal Aid?
no, I'll do it. I at least owe them an explanation.
Yeah. Will. Where are we?
she wants 50% on her jetliner class action.
she has the crew, we've got the passengers. 35%. Maybe.
okay, tell Celeste 35%.
the way you usually do-- your charm.
I believe in you.
Bye.
she's playing hard to get.
Mr. Dolan, how are you?
I'm okay, thank you. I just, uh...
I'm so sorry.
no. We love you.
can I, uh... - No, not yet. No contact.
Jakie, this all just a big mistake, all right?
I'll be home soon and we'll celebrate your birthday, all right, kiddo?
daddy loves you very much.
come on. No record. Not even a parking ticket.
that's why I offered second degree.
shave off another five years.
you haven't met my workmate, have you?
she's an AUSA to make sure there's no racial imbalance in plea bargaining.
so that's what's going on here?
you're hard bargaining for, what, appearances?
I don't think it's just appearance, do you?
I think it's another state's attorney preoccupation.
forgotten in a month.
I think he liked you.
what's the plan?
turn the preliminary hearing into a poor man's deposition, get the prosecution to show their hand?
judge isn't going to let that happen.
all rise! The Honorable Francis Flamm presiding.
no, no. Everybody sit down, please.
justice Tie-Dye?
Evelyn made a great zucchini bread, if anybody wants.
Evelyn, quiet, hand it around. Come on.
Chicago Legal Aid Society offer her flex time. The option to telecommute.
tell her we'll find her a corner office.
we're out of corners. Where are you, football game?
Yes, my midday treat to myself. No. Legal Aid.
come on, Diane, you don't have to break up in person. Just make a call.
Mr. Coyne, please. Tell him it's Diane Lockhart.
Yeah, well, that was the plan, but my guilt was getting to me.
guilt is for the weak.
go-- sweeten our offer.
the cashier pulled this gun from a holster he had under the counter.
then they just started firing.
and you were standing 20 feet from the window.
and how far was the shooter inside the store?
your Honor, again, objection. This is a preliminary hearing.
the defense is using this as a poor man's deposition, to get a preview of our case.
Yep. Heard it the first time, Counselor.
got it. Overruled.
and how far was the shooter inside the store?
he's killing us. - Get used to it.
ten feet, probably?
so, 30 feet in total?
20 feet to the window, ten feet inside.
was he on the sidewalk or in the parking lot?
and so I'm curious, Mr. Boylan, were you on the sidewalk in front of the store, or in the parking lot?
on the sidewalk.
on the sidewalk.
Yep, I can see into the store. There's no reflection problem.
where did he say the shooter went?
where did shooter go?
where did this person go after you saw him shoot?
back into the store to hide.
so you saw him hide?
no, I'm just...
he went toward the rear of the store.
so maybe the real robber went out the back door.
Objection!
it's one exit. Punch-key lock. You need to know the code to get out.
damn.
detective, have you heard of cross-racial identification?
I have.
but you don't give it much credence.
well, do I think that some whites tend to misidentify black suspects because they have trouble distinguishing features-- yes.
but the eyewitness here was black and the accused white.
and have you seen studies that blacks often misidentify whites?
I haven't, but I'll take your word for it.
didn't Mr. Boylan give a more general description of a white suspect, before he saw my client at your desk, being questioned?
are you talking about the artist's sketch?
I wasn't.
but sure.
continue, please.
and this artist sketch was done prior to Mr. Boylan's seeing my client in the police station?
Yes, but I wouldn't call the description "general " .
isn't it possible that Mr. Boylan only fixated on my client as the shooter, because he saw him being questioned by police?
and couldn't this sketch direct you to the real killer?
no. We have the real killer.
your Honor, defense asks for access to this sketch.
seems like a reasonable request. Counselor?
any trouble getting it to them?
any more questions? I got to get back to work.
Yeah, so you were here yesterday during the shooting.
Yes. It was crazy. The cops got here really fast.
people running around, screaming...
and did you see anyone who looked like this, running around, screaming?
I thought they caught the guy who did it.
no.
I don't know. This looks like a hundred people.
do you mind?
sure.
Yeah. Try and get the crime scene photos.
cops aren't giving me access.
we also would suggest, Your Honor,
they do have access, Your Honor, in discovery.
which we always get at the last minute.
because we have to prepare them, so it takes time.
well, who prepares it, Counselor?
give me their number.
maybe they can expedite it.
Tim, listen-- can you find out who bought a lottery ticket from its bar code?
you do know you're in the criminal law mixer?
I like criminal.
the men are so...straight.
so we're fine with a three percent bump and a two-year commitment to your litigators.
do you know what it means to feed the rat, Will?
do I...? No.
you can live your sweet little domesticated life.
you can date your cute little apple-cheeked lawyer.
Apple-cheeked?
but eventually, you have to feed the rat.
return to the wild. - that's fascinating.
we're not going above three percent.
you need to feed the rat, Will.
you are killing yourself trying to be normal.
I am normal.
Mr. Florrick, hi. Big fan. - Hello.
I came here especially hoping to bump into you.
I think you know Will Gardner.
Yes, I do. Hi, Will. - Peter.
you two have so much in common, don't you?
we do have a lot in common.
and how do you two know each other?
us? We...
worked at the same firm together long time ago.
we did a lot more than that.
the Baltimore firm: Osterman, Lee, Canfield. It was my first job out of college.
my first threesome was with Will.
that's true. - What was her name again?
well, you have to start somewhere.
so Alicia Florrick, huh?
well, she works with Will, she's married to you.
must be quite an arrangement. Discuss.
it is quite an arrangement. Yes.
any awkward moments?
you mean besides this one?
how many kids do you have, Peter?
two. Boy and a girl.
I love boys and girls.
that's very domestic.
what ages? - 16 and 14.
Oh, that's a very good age. Isn't that a very good age, Will?
me, I don't get kids.
I mean, I get why they're important, but...
you get them if you got them.
Really? I don't know. I'm too selfish.
have you ever met his kids?
no, I haven't. - Really?
Alicia never brought them to work?
I think I'll head out.
it's good to see you, Peter. - Yeah.
who did you say you were with again?
the Lottery Control Board.
a lottery ticket was paid out yesterday for five dollars.
it should have been $500.
well, that's my receipt all right.
but I bought it as a gift for my son.
Where's your son?
Oh, he moved back here-- home-- few months ago.
lovely.
Mrs. Silvestre, may I use your bathroom?
Hi, dear. Did you have a nice day?
there's a young lady here for you. - Who?
she's from the Lottery Control Board. Where is she?
Hello?
Hello?
I feel like you're cheating on me.
only for money. - You think that makes it better?
between Will and Diane, who holds more power?
it's equal.
it's never equal. - Yeah.
Diane has more power in criminal, and Will in civil.
but Diane controls the purse strings.
only by default. Will hates dealing with it.
but if Will says no, is it real?
often.
you're not helping much. - Darn.
and this Julius guy-- what about him?
he's head of litigation. - He doesn't like me.
why doesn't he like me?
you're the new and shiny thing.
does it matter that he doesn't like me?
no.
anybody else with power?
david Lee, family law.
and Alicia-- where does she stand in all of this?
yes?
she's only a third-year associate, but she matters.
because of her husband? - Various reasons.
she can persuade people.
people, as in Will?
what are you looking for, Eli? - The hierarchy.
usually, I can figure it out, but this place is like a mom-and-pop store.
it's all Will and Diane.
if you want to persuade Diane, you persuade David Lee.
if you want to persuade Will, you persuade Alicia.
and here comes your next customer.
okay. Where are we?
according to the time-coded register receipt here, this lottery ticket was redeemed seconds before the murder.
whose ticket? - Mitch Silvestre.
he's a manager from a fish market across the way.
as you can see, there is a slight resemblance between him and the artist sketch.
can you get more on Silvestre?
I'm on him. - Good.
we need to delay in court.
what are you doing?
I'm working on a pro bono. What are you doing?
I don't know. Whoring myself out.
sort of miss you. - I sort of miss you, too.
well, what can we do about that?
I don't know. What do you want to do?
let me call you back. - I'll be here.
okay. Love you.
I said that... - I know.
no, automatically. Mechanically. I didn't mean anything.
will, don't worry about it.
I... it's not that I don't care.
will, call me later. - Right. Good-bye.
I'm sorry, okay? Don't pout. - I'm fine.
but you're not accepting my apology. What do I got to do?
bring us bankruptcy. - Okay, I'll come clean.
you're not chasing me, Will. I'm chasing you.
you're chasing me? - Yes.
how you doing that?
litigation and bankruptcy are, in fact, leaving the firm. That is true.
so is tax and family law. And we're all regrouping.
as what, a jazz combo? - No, as a new firm.
and we want you.
Celeste, I know you're a dreamer, and I know you like to live in your head, but what in your wildest dreams would make you think I would leave my firm, one of the most prestigious in Chicago, to come work for what is basically a start-up?
cause I have the one thing I know you want.
what? - Can't even guess?
I can't even begin to guess.
I'm happy where I am. - Baseball commissioner.
it's the one thing George W. Bush wanted more than the presidency.
don't play games with me. - I'm not.
the league's our biggest client.
commissioner is getting on in years. He needs a successor.
the successor's going to come from our firm.
you know baseball. You know the law.
I don't believe you.
call some friends, Will. You know who to call. Look at me.
I'm not making this up.
when I go all in, it's not with a stone-cold bluff.
I got my dispute resolution seminar in ten minutes.
if you want to discuss how this will work, stop by.
not Judge Powers, Judge Romano! And tell her the brief is on its way.
all right, got it! - Sorry about that.
been in court all day. - No problem, Mr. Coyne.
Maggie, hold all calls, give me about five minutes.
you were a litigator at Portman & Michaels.
partner track.
dropped out. Couldn't stand all the meetings.
next door down, man. - Thanks.
thank you for picking up the slack on the convenience store shooting.
I hear you have two lawyers on the case?
I...Really?
it's good to see, considering all the firms that are pulling back these days.
the Hanley deposition's over there.
Yes, well, actually...
I need to talk to you about this, uh...
guys, it's a go on the Packer appeal.
see if you can pull up some U of C intern time.
ties? Gentlemen, you go to court, you wear a tie.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm sorry.
I know this, uh...
might not be a great time for this but we have to, um...
our firm is bowing out of our pro bono obligations.
just till things pick up. You know, the economy.
I get it. Don't worry about it.
thank you for fighting for us, anyway.
well, I mean we hope to return when things improve.
it's okay. We're not sure we'll be here. We lost our funding.
You...what, your state funding? - Yeah.
budget crunch. - So, what are you gonna do?
I don't know. You know, we still have a few options, so...
such as? - Such as knocking on a few doors.
yelling at a few rich people.
one thing I've learned in the not-for-profit world is that eventually, someone steps up.
well, I-I should go. - Yes, thanks.
you know, it's good to finally meet you in person.
and you.
I wish, uh...
I don't know what I wish.
the world were different.
that sounds good! I'll be here waiting.
will Gardner, what the hell took you so long?
come on in. You don't want to miss the Q and A.
no, thanks. I'm looking for, um, dispute resolution, neutrality something or other.
next door on the right.
look who's here. Saved you a seat.
do you need help?
yeah?
I'm on him now.
easy does it. Meeting at 6 pm
alcoholics Anonymous?
Yeah. Mitch goes to meetings twice a week.
what about the cash in the envelope?
legit. He was chapter treasurer.
he likes to bet at the track, but it was all of his own money.
still doesn't mean he wasn't the killer.
Yeah, but this does.
I checked the register at the convenience store. It's an hour fast.
it could be an accident, or it was monkeyed with to run a lottery scam.
it still puts him at the store an hour before the murder.
we can still tell a story.
the guy worked a few doors down. He knew the code to the locks.
a 30-year-old who likes to gamble.
whose financial situation is bad enough it forces him to move home.
I appreciate that we're trying to find a fall guy, but putting this on an innocent man?
isn't that how our client got into this mess?
we're defending our client.
all rise!
the Honorable Francis Flamm presiding.
well, good morning, everyone.
it's good to see you all here again.
and I see we've grown by one at the defense table.
Yes, we have, Your Honor.
I've been so moved by the plight of Mr. Dolan that I have decided to lend my assistance.
well, it's great to have you in my court, Ms. Lockhart.
and I understand your team would like to argue a motion to dismiss.
Yes, Your Honor.
the prosecutor has built this case on one weak reed: a single eyewitness.
an eyewitness who was 30 feet from the crime and who only identified our client after seeing the police questioning him.
Mr. Dolan has no record.
he has a wife and a son who are here in this court right now.
he is an innocent man, Your Honor.
and it would be unjust not to dismiss these charges.
let me.
let you, what? - Argue.
your Honor, injustice comes in all shapes and sizes.
it's not just in the man held, it's also in the man released.
my grandfather once said, a judging brain requires a listening ear.
I think that was true then, but it's doubly true now.
you need to hear our full case before you can decide.
to dismiss before you hear would be an injustice.
your grandfather is the Reverend Roy Stonehouse?
he is, Your Honor.
well, I'm honored. How is he?
he's good.
recovering.
well, please tell him how greatly he's admired.
my first thesis I wrote was on Selma.
I'll tell him.
and convey my respect, as well.
we all owe men like your grandfather a huge debt.
but let's not forget that this case is about an innocent man.
well, I think that still needs to be determined, don't you, Counselor?
Yes. What I meant, Your Honor...
Yes, it's all right. I know what you meant.
I just think that it would be unjust to summarily dismiss this case before offering a listening ear.
and so, your motion is denied, Ms. Lockhart-- and the other two with you.
we will move directly to trial.
Oh, and, uh, Ms. Stonehouse, thank you.
I have chills.
I don't like to use that much.
does it get you into restaurants?
I'm out. - come on.
not when you're up like that. - Yep, when I'm up like that.
we'll be here tonight. After the Civil Mixer.
I'm fine, thanks.
take you to breakfast? - No.
geez, you sound so definitive. - Yep.
so, I'll hear from you on the baseball commissioner job?
Celeste, no. I didn't like this life, not even when I was living it.
I didn't like not knowing when I was being conned or conning.
you don't think there's a job? - No, I checked.
in ten or 15 years, there's a chance I could vie for baseball commissioner.
what a sad thought that is.
losing what I love now to chase something in the future.
what do you love? You said,Losing what I love now.
my job!
I don't believe you. I don't believe you love it.
what you love is winning.
and you can't win big enough at Lockhart-Gardner.
this is your dream. What happened to pursuing your dream?
what happened to work?
not everybody can pursue their dreams. Someone has to work.
that is so sad. - No. Not really.
take care.
that's the cashier's bay.
and that's where the shooter was. And the line of sight checks out.
I'm not seeing what's good.
the line of sight checks out until the cashier reaches under the counter for the gun.
the wall would've hidden the cashier from view.
and Boylan told the police the cashier pulled the gun from a holster taped under the counter.
but he couldn't have seen him reach under the counter for his gun.
unless he was in the store.
Boylan tried to escape, saw a patrol car pull up, and pretended to be an eyewitness, not a killer.
so, let's go talk to Cary.
only a few more minutes.
I've always waited for bad things to happen. Every day.
Travis sees the good things.
and I'm always waiting for the bad.
well, this is good. - I know.
I don't want to be that anymore.
the worst thing happened, and we're still here.
will you thank the other two lawyers?
I will, but it was really the prosecutor. He reversed himself.
can I...? - Yes.
buddy. How's it going?
yes?
Oh, nothing. I'm, uh, just looking.
an espresso machine would be nice.
the release went well? - It did. You should've been there.
no, I didn't do enough.
how was whoring? - Unproductive.
listen, about what I said yesterday...
will, please. I'm on the phone with my kids and I say,"I love you " ,
and then I'm on the phone with my mother-in-law and I say,"I love you," too.
it's an accident.
Yes. But do you think we should talk?
no, I don't, actually. - You don't?
no.
you sure? - I'm so sure.
I've never been so sure.
I'm not interested in anyone else.
Will...you're talking about it.
no fuss, no muss. - That's me.
Celeste Serrano is forming her own firm.
bankruptcy, litigation, family law.
I don't want to be careful anymore.
I don't want to count every penny and worry more about failing than doing what's right.
okay.
legal Aid is losing its office space.
everybody's pulling back because of the economy.
I want to bring them in-house. There's rooms next to Eli.
he won't like it, but he'll have to live with it until we find more room.
when our lawyers have free time, they can offer it to Legal Aid.
you should've broken up on the phone.
I want to do this.
and I want your okay.
okay.
who's that? - The new judge. He arrived yesterday.
good day to you. - We kiss your hands...
he's a judge? - Yes... a judge.
is he dangerous? - No, no... he's a gentleman.
why did you speak so quietly then?
moron, because I got a cold! I lost my voice!
GIOVANNONA LONG-THIGH, HONORABLY DISHONORED
you're a local, what weather can we expect?
what would I know?
hold this...
what barbarians!
this needs analysing immediately... - Drugs?
no, dirty river water. Send it to the Catania hygiene office.
will do.
come in.
good day, judge
the Catania report has come, the water analysis.
good, have you read it? - Yes, it says the water's polluted.
what a surprise, we didn't need Catania rocket science to learn that!
I want to know the cause.
the report talks of dangerous colored substances.
the pollution is caused by industrial effluent.
it probably comes from a paint factory.
great, we'll strike immediately...
you're local, do you know of a factory near the river?
as far as I know there's only one...the cheese factory.
the Straccolone?!
scandal IN SICILY

italian SKYSCRAPER
commander La Noce is in his office and unavailable.
I repeat, he's busy. Try calling tomorrow.
careful, that typewriter can give you a shock.
Albertini!
Albertini!
where are you?!
tell me, s-s-sir... - Albertini, try to relax.
if you get upset you stutter, and if you stutter I get upset, ok?
Yes, sir... - Give me a cigarette.
they're finished... - Ok, forget it.
have you found that "honorable" whatever?
I spent two days on the phone, got cramps in my fingers...
all the "honorables" in Italy have vanished.
I knew it! The moment people need their representatives...
we have to find honorable Mr. Zuzzu, he always helps us!
I did. - Did he hit you?
Yes, with a pot. - Were you in a kitchen?
no, a clinic... it was ceramic, what they call a chamber pot.
is he sick? - Hepatitis.
he says it was our free samples.
damn, you know you shouldn't eat our cheese!
what could I do? Our brochure is our only edible product!
it's too late now...
sure! You're relaxed because you don't give a damn!
but if we go bust, your butt's on the street too!
try laughing when you're in shit up to here.
I'm sorry, the b-b-b... - You're an idiot!
What?! - Commander...
were you eavesdropping?
do you want to know how we are? Awful, my beauty!
but you'll be fine, with those tits, you've no need to worry!
but I'm off! I'll go abroad, emigrate!
I'll go to Mexico, Peru, Lake 'Titicaca!
titi who? - Who knows?
to think I could be on television now.
as an employee? - No, a p-p-presenter.
I sat the exam! - How did it go?
G-g-great! - Why didn't they take you?
they say I'm an a-a-anarchist!
what on earth are you doing?!
go rest in peace!
can't you sleep? - No!
I won't be the only one staying awake tonight.
I realized that!
Hello! - Hello, who's there?
Albertini? - You sound far away...
Albertini!
Hello? - I knew it! You were sleeping, right?
no, not at all! Who sleeps at 2 AM?
I don't care, I'm awake! How are we doing with Pedicò!
with who? - With Pedicò!
who's he? - Idiot!
two years ago he was industry under-secretary.
he's an important politician, might become a minister...
and we don't know him! We have to woo certain people--.
as you woo beautiful women!
you're right, but with P-Pedicò we have an advantage...
we're still virgins.
you won't be for long, one of these days I'll bust your ass!
No! "Virgins" in the sense that Pedicò still hasn't received...
our free samples! - Right, that's true...
but how can we reach him? - Through someone in his party.
wait, wait!
Marta, will you let me have it?
holy Mother, don't tempt me! I'm doing 40 hours...
who cares, do six days if you want...
do Milan-Sanremo, or whatever comes to mind!
Hello, Albertini? I've had an idea... Albertini?
moron! - Hello, who am I talking to?
damn you! Are you asleep?
no, I'm an insomniac! - Good. I've had an idea.
do you remember Monsignor Alatri, he organized "Kids City"?
I was about to mention him! - I did instead!
we have to find him immediately.
I want to see him tomorrow. Call him at Rocca Pizzo...
and book two flights for Catania.
call now, at 2 AM? - Sure... you're the insomniac.
yes... but not the monsignor!
don't call long distance, I pay the phone bill.
how was your flight? - Wonderful, monsignor...
a marvellous one hour. It's longer from Catania to here!
what a lovely day... - Would you like a 'cannolo'?
no, don't tempt me... your offer is generous, however.
I hope your wife doesn't mind...
why should my wife mind if I eat an extra 'cannolo'?
I was referring to the land you made available for "Kids City."
right, I'd forgotten...
it's also your wife's, right? - Yes, of course...
but as you know, Marta is a very devout woman.
this comforts me greatly. Clotilde, could you get the file, please...
immediately, monsignor...
I don't think she'll oppose this small formality...
what is it? - A binding commitment...
your secretary mentioned the reason for your visit...
so I prepared a small statement.
I see you don't waste time...
my motto is, "The paths to paradise are infinite, and should be walked well."
that's a good one!
would you care to sign? - Yes, yes, no, no, but...
I don't have a pen! - Here, a Japanese double-tip!
writes 24 hours non-stop. - Great... you son of a bitch!
24 hours non-stop, Japanese double-tip... here, monsignor.
I'd like to take advantage of this meeting to ask your advice...
he already knows, commander...
did you tell him? - No, everyone knows your problem...
it's all lies! Chemical products are only used to purify...
if you can find one gram of that stuff in our Straccolone...
I'll become a priest! I mean... it's slanderous!
sure, but in cases like this you need top-level backing...
we thought of Honorable Pedicò... - An excellent choice.
he's a devout Christian, a man of rare virtue.
he lives in a country villa with his wife Maria Annunziata, known as Mary.
a woman of great... - Virtue?
no, stature.
they're often accompanied by his secretary, Eufemia...
and attend midday mass every Sunday.
Carmelo Pedicò is the right man, his power is unlimited.
his word is law, his wishes command...
in the Rocca Pizzo province, come fair weather or foul.
so, if it rains tomorrow we'll know who to blame!
we'll have no problem finding him on Sunday.
there are other problems... - Why, is he stubborn, a crook?
no, he's honest... - Then it's done!
honorable Pedicò! May I have a word?
Ah, monsignor! Wait in the car, Maw...
come with me...
honorable, I wanted to introduce two dear friends...
commander La Noce and accountant Albertini, his secretary.
my secretary, Eufemia.
commander La Noce is president of Straccolone, the cheese factory...
currently, as you know, the victim of a regrettable circumstance.
sadly Italy has 116, 000 regrettable circumstances every day!
I beg you, sir, you can do a lot... - I'm merely a deputy...
Yes, but everyone says you are a fat...
I mean, a faithful interpreter of people's needs, soon to be a minister.
I thank you for the thought. The elections will be soon...
and all will be clear! I'm sorry, my wife is waiting in the car.
let me accompany you. - Thank you...
another stitch up! - Really?
didn't you hear? He wants to establish the truth.
commander, we need to make a drastic decision.
don't say stupid things... - I didn't say anything stupid.
I knew it would end like that!
that priest made a fool of me!
he took the land, and we haven't heard from Pedicò since!
it's been three days already! - Pedicò must have some flaw...
if we find his weak point, we're there!
you spoke without stuttering, but nonsense as usual!
I know everything about Pedicò's past and present...
he doesn't steal, doesn't speculate, has no illegitimate children...
...doesn't blackmail, smuggle, or take drugs...
and despite being Sicilian, he's not even mafia!
what an awful man!
who is it? - A priest from Monsignor Alatri.
send him in!
our man from heaven has come. Open, quickly...
please...
good day. Commander La Noce?
Yes, that's me, take a seat...
so, Monsignor Alatri, any news?
actually, I'm not sure I can speak...
speak freely, these are my collaborators... unfortunately.
I have an explosive document on your honorable gentleman...
Pedicò?! - I can't name him...
I knew that honorable man, who we can't name...
had an A-A-Achilles' heel!
this is engineer De Vitis, our honorable helped him obtain...
the famous Riva dei Ciclopi construction project.
this is engineer de Vitis' wife...
Oh, my gooooosh!
I have to change... - No! Oh, please.
this is professor Tamigiani, our honorable helped make him head...
of a Palermo clinic, even though, as a doctor, Tamigiani...
is P-P-pitiful!
this is professor Tamigiani's wife...
holy fuck! - Behind me, Satan!
move ahead, reverend!
this is professor Voccia...
our honorable helped him obtain an exclusive patent...
worth 200 million.
this is Mrs. Voccia, may God keep her safe!
what a guy, this Honorable Pedicò!
he has a weakness for other men's wives.
commander, we're riding a winner! - Albertini, dismount and think-.
what can I do, send my wife to sleep with our honorable?
knowing your wife, you'd do better to send the monsignor!
Albertini, you must be exhausted...
take two days' vacation!
commander, I've an idea. - This time I'll shoot you!
listen... your wife's all "church and home," no one knows her...
what's to stop us replacing her with another woman?
for example, with a beautiful girl like our Luisella...
engineer, you've gone crazy!
my boyfriend plays basketball and he's six foot four!
ask him, if you dare! Commander, may I go?
good night! What's got into you?
it was just a hypothesis... do you know how many I can find, better than her?
I have a simple, infallible plan!
friday night Pedicò takes the sleeper train for Rocca Pizzo...
we find a beautiful girl who gets on the same train with you...
who you introduce as your wife! Have I been clear?
you didn't stutter this time either, though it's not a bad idea!
can you find the right girl? - If I don't, I'll cut my...
I'll hold you to it! - Not those... I'll cut my hair!
with modern technology, all it takes is a button!
Hello, can I help? - Well, I'd like...
car, home or boat?
be clear.
explain. - A loose woman...
be clear. - A slut, ok?!
fine, last on the left.
good day. - How can I help you?
the woman on information sent me...
I'm looking for a special friend. - Tell me your preferences...
tall, short, thin, rotund, blonde, red, brunette?
actually, it's not for me, it's for a friend...
don't you know your friend's tastes?
she must be Swed... - Swedish?
no, a sweetie. One who makes you book heart treatment on sight.
I see, leave it to me...
blonde, busty, 5 foot 8...
Ah, sorry, she has to be a good t-t-talker...
we'll put "good, quick tongue."
perfect!
we're searching Turin to Venice. That's the best area.
the electronic brain will reply in 10 seconds...
see how quick it is?
miss G. R. number 116, will fly Alitalia from Milan at 15: 10 hours...
arriving Rome 16: 10.
are you sure you'll recognize her? - No, we've never met...
so what do we do, stop every blonde on sight?
we're in the hands of the electronic brain, its organization is perfect.
the girl will go to the news-stand and buy a copy of "Corriere di Brescia."
O-o-o...
O-o... - Of course, over there...
no, I mean, oh fuck!
that must be her... - Relax, we'll know in a moment.
the "Giornale di Bergamo," please. - Isn't "Corriere di Brescia" better?
Why? - Bergamo and Brescia are neighbors, no?
no.
when you make love, do you talk to your husband?
only if he phones...
the "Giornale di Brescia," please...
Thanks.
are you from Brescia? - Yes, I'm Mr. G. R. 116.
incredible! - What?! I'll take our honorable this?
Honorables are fine by me, I'm not fussy.
impossible, the electronic brain never makes mistakes.
you're right, the mistake is all mine.
I've been a mistake since my father conceived me.
laugh away. Your father hardly got you right!
right, an electronic brain with balls of ricotta cheese!
if I'd asked for a liquidizer, they'd have sent an aircraft carrier!
it's not like I wanted a harpist, or a Chinese translator...
damn, all I wanted was a slut!
# I'm a woman, I'm no saint...
# Don't tempt me, I'm no saint...
Hi!
these girls have picked a bad road...no one passes here!
hey boy, are you afraid of us?
no...
I can't take him one who does this for a "living..."
far from "living," she'd have us "dead."
if I present her as Mrs. La Noce, all "church and home..."
honorable Pedicò will turn Muslim!
darling, fancy a tickle?
go on, there's no tax!
are you expecting anyone? - Yes, clients.
you look new... - I am.
great, just what I was looking for...Hop in!
5, 000 lira. - Is that all?! Come on, hop in!
what are you ca-ca-called? - Coco.
are you shittin' me? - No, my name's Coco.
Coco... the name's not important...
listen, would you like to earn a b-b-bunch of money?
Robertuzzo said 5, 000. - Who? Ah, your guy...
if I offer 400, 000 for two days' work...
would Robertuzzo be co-co... - I'm Coco!
Co-content, I meant! - Uh...
you don't talk much? Good, I like that!
a woman who ta-ta...I'll tell you later!
so, will you do two days for me?
well, ok... - A deal?
what about Robertuzzo? - Don't worry, I'll handle him.
we'll write him a note and leave it at his house...
that'll keep it between us two...
come in, come...
to the left.
I'll show you...
I used to share with mother...
then she went home. Make yourself at home...
God your house is a mess! We'll fix it up later...
are you a speed queen, or something? This is Rome, not the Monza Grand Prix!
not talking's fine, but do you need to strip without warning?
you're Commander La Noce's wife now, you have to dress like a dove...
you only strip when Pedicò starts to chat you up...
Coco, are you getting this?
we have to hurry, the train leaves at 7: 00...
wait, I'll go buy you some lady's clothes.
let's get your measurements...
98...
98... to think that from these breasts...
depends the life of one hundred men!
a hundred? - You don't need to feed them directly!
once you get under Pedicò, they'll all go back to work...
110
Oh my God...I'm tempted to screw it all!
Hello? - You moron, where the fuck are you?
wait, before getting angry you should see...
what the hell have you done?!
we're cha-cha... - Have you got a girl, or not?
yes... she's beautiful. - Albertini!
beautiful, real, ca-caressable!
you're such a sweetie! - Me?
Yeah, sweet and righteous!
with a john like you, I'd be the happiest whore in the world!
you can't talk like that! - Why not? Robertuzzo never minded!
what the fuck's wrong with you?
shit, I never noticed your language! - You know, I'm very shy...
but with you, I feel free to say what I like!
shut up already!
you sure know how to make a woman like me feel good...
the total opposite of Robertuzzo! - Coco, shut up!
when he gets something up his ass, he beats the shit out of me...
Coco, we're in trouble! You can't be the commander's wife!
you know what? I don't fucking care...
it's you I like... - Oh my God!
I should make her eat a dictionary!
Albertini!
where are you going?!
at last! Splendid, truly splendid! Enchanting!
commander, she's a d-d...
I can tell, delightful! - Commander, are you on this train too?
Yes, a sudden business trip, something important...
let me introduce my wife. - An honor, madam...
my compliments to your beauty!
and my secretary, actually, my right arm...
an incomparable, irreplaceable man...
but for him I would have missed the train and the deal...
commander, I-I-I... - You what?!
we need to talk! - What's up now?
I'll tell you!
don't shove, are you crazy?! - I need to be alone with you!
I don't want to be alone with you!
I'll make you want to...it's important, really!
ma'am, go back to your grave, please!
No! No! I've been cursed since I met you!
hi there, auntie!
let's hope war breaks out and you're my nurse!
God you're beautiful! - Wanna meet my little brother?
bring your hat here, sweetie, you're on the wrong train!
stop that!
get inside, move! - Get your hands off me!
you'll pay for this! - Yeah, sure...
idiot, at the last moment you tell me it won't work... why?!
even! second word she says "fuck" four times!
no I don't! The "fucks" are yours! All I said was I like you...
but I'll still do the work...
with the commander, the honorable, the station master, who the fuck ever!
does she always speak like that? - No, worse!
didn't you realize earlier?
I was looking for a stunner, not a Nobel winner!
throw her off the train! - What?!
it's too late, now...
you're fired immediately! - On the train?
Yes. - Fired on a speeding train?
Yes! - I see...
I'm a failure, I've no more reason to live!
give me a rope!
to hang yourself?
no, to stop that bag falling on my head!
fuck you and the bag!
Ah, honorable, are you on this train too?
like even! Friday...
lemon juice with a dash of bicarbonate and sugar, please...
and a Fernet for the lady.
honorable, this is your day for meetings!
first lawyer Rossi, then Colonel Maccicché, and now La Noce!
do you know La Noce, sir? - La Noce... do we know La Noce?
Yes, sir, the Roman industrialist with a cheese factory in Rocca Pizzo.
Monsignor Alatri mentioned him, so we met him...
did we speak?
Yes, one Sunday after mass, a very interesting person.
now I recall. An industrialist with a rather regrettable situation...
but you should see his wife!
beautiful? - Amazing!
haven't you met? - I haven't had the honor...
she's a marvel! - Her husband must be very jealous!
in fact, he keeps her hidden!
he must come to diner, he must bring her to the dining car.
I'll get you sandwiches, but don't move from here.
good luck... - You too, honorable...
goodbye... - Your Fernet Branca.
Hi. - Hi...
commander La Noce... - Commander La Noce!
my dear sir! - We were just talking of you...
I hope it was something good!
don't be modest, how could one talk otherwise of you?
you're an exquisite woman - Why haven't we heard from you?
I didn't want to bother your... - You're no bother.
in fact, to show my friendship, I invite you and your wife to dinner.
MY---my wife? Really?
we know she's traveling on this train...
and you keep her "hidden."
I hope you won't insult me by refusing!
not at all, happily...
we did well to take the second sitting...
that way we've no hurry! - Yes, no hurry...
it's so nice here, and this fruit salad is delicious...
Yes, truly excellent...
I see the lady doesn't like her fruit salad.
not at all, she loves it, she's crazy about it!
sir, do you go to Sicily often? - Yes, whenever possible!
does madam know Sicily?
no, she doesn't, but you're so right to take a little rest...
I do whenever I can!
this week I've a lot to do, I have to reorganize my library...
eufemia, by the way...I suggest you retire to bed...
you have a busy day tomorrow. - Actually, I...
go, go! Our guests will excuse you...
Goodnight, everyone! - Sweet dreams, madam.
sent from heaven...
Thanks, you too...
bye...
I'm so sorry...
it was my fault, I got in the way...
sit, sit!
no, don't worry...
no, madam, I can't allow this, you're kind...
I'm deeply mortified...
I can't allow...
well, whatever...
I'm Honorable Pedicò's secretary.
a pleasure... - Not for me.
the honorable has been given cabin 7, and me number 3. It's too far away.
who's in number 6? - Let's see...
it's Mr. Straccolone, who's also taken number 5...
it's not a man, it's a company, and they've booked 3 people.
so, is there a cabin free near me?
Yes, number 1, over the wheels, which no one wants.
good, put the honorable in there. - Over the wheels?
Yes! Given we can't put him under them!
guard? - Yes, madam?
we had seen zeese people behaving very scandal.
we want to change cabin. - Fuck me, what a night!
I mean, I can't kick them out! - Gut, zis is very gut!
I'll put you in cabin 7, it's a very quiet cabin.
Zis is peace and quiet? - Totally quiet, eternally peaceful!
Cheers... am Wrong, or does madam never 'speak'?
true, she never speaks but...
the lady fu-fu... - "Fu" what?
she's founded two important charitable ventures...
and to make sure they succeed, she's made a vow to Saint Rocco.
Ah, right, I forgot...a 24-hour vow of silence!
that's very noble...I'm only sorry not to hear her voice.
the vow ends tomorrow at noon...
however, isn't it time we went to bed?
Yes, my wife is very tired. - Would you like a coffee?
please, if she takes coffee, she won't sleep till Christmas!
madam, I'm truly enchanted...
thank you, I'm moved by your kindness...
she can't speak, so I translate her thoughts!
goodnight... - Thank you so much. Come, dear...
holy Mother of God, what a woman! - Yes, extraordinary...
you know her well, tell me about her.
what kind of woman is she? - Mrs. La Noce is a saint...
a saint? - With all the sacrifices of a saint...
but at the same time a devil!
in what way? - One way, straight to hell!
she's ca-ca... - Candid?
no, ca-ca... - A cat?
Carnal! - A slave to her senses?
in other words, is she "beddable"?
bed, folding bed, blanket...she's a nympho!
a nymphomaniac? So what's with Saint Rocco?
she gets sexual attacks, for hours, weeks, months...
she turns you to rubber, then returns to her senses...
has an attack of religious remorse, and becomes a saint!
it's an amazingly sensual scenario!
holy Mother of God!
you're an excellent organizer...let's arrange something in secret.
waiter, champagne! - A great idea...
we're there... - Where, Sicily?
no, with the honorable Pedicò...I've fixed everything.
he's next door... first we get him randy as a rooster...
then I go and announce I've convinced your wife.
a "church and home" woman? How?
my mind's a miracle!
guard? - Uh?
guard, where's my cabin? - I don't know, sir...
you don't know? - Ah, you're the honorable sir!
not very, right now... - One too many never dishonored no one.
but three bottles did! - You're in number 1, sir.
please, this way. - Here?
you'll have a great night here. - I hope so!
louder, he can't hear you!
Yes, I like it! Give it to me...
kiss me, kiss my mouth! Kiss my prick!
Yes, yes, like that! ...
yes... who cares about the honorable...
great, that's great!
you're fabulous!
stop that... we're here to work! Stop, you filthy pig!
commander, I got carried away by passion!
you brute!
guard!
what is it, ladies?
to sleep impossible when ze man he say "my prick"!
Zer is another who say "filthy pig"!
my apologies, these things happen in the best sleeping cars!
I'll put you in cabin 9.
after this, I'm down to the engine itself.
no worries, the man in 8 is deaf!
Battipaglia station!
is anyone there? Guard!
good evening... - Hi, I'm looking for a bed...
don't disappoint me. - No, no, of course not...
here, sweetie.
come, it's a quiet night, we've still some beds.
thank you, what luck to find such a kind young man!
here, number 7 is free...
shouldn't I do something first?
I don't know, sir, the toilets are at either end of the carriage...
no, silly, I meant a ticket...
you do that with the ticket collector. - The ticket collector...
night... - Uh, good night...
even on the trains!
can I help, sir? - No, thanks, I'm going to the toilet...
OK, I leave first, warn Pedicò, and then go to my cabin...
you wait 10 minutes, then go to cabin 7, Pedicò's...
Hey, remember not to open your mouth...
shall we synchronize watches? - Fuck off!
it was for the sake of organization...
honorable, still awake?
that champagne went to my head...
do you feel sick? - I'm fine now... and the lady?
I convinced her, she'll be in your arms shortly.
I can't wait. Where? - In cabin number 7...
I'll go freshen up to be ready for her...
who is it?
what are you doing? You should be in cabin 7!
but I like number 5... - Don't be silly, go to Pedicò!
who cares about Pedicò? I like you. If I had a man like you...
I know, but leave! Go to the honorable!
not so fast, sweetie! When I make love...
I go all the way! Otherwise I get hiccups!
God, what melons! And what amazing thighs!
I shouldn't boast, but back home they call me "Giovannona Long-thigh."
Robertuzzo made me change the name... he says Coco is more refined.
darling... - What are you doing... that's my nose!
Damn! They even put handles!
number 3?
what cheek, imagine if the honorable knew!
what? - I knew you'd come!
that's why I left the door open!
no, no, madam! For the love of God, stop!
madam, I'm moved deeply to be on my knees beside you...
to express my immense admiration.
I know you can't talk, but that doesn't matter...
I now entrust to my hands...
the task of warming you, stimulating you...
until our embrace becomes a raging flood...
as unstoppable and incandescent as an eruption on Etna!
over these shoulders, this hip...
this promontory...
my hands...
mamma!
help! Help!
he's a crab! He's grabbed me like a crab!
get off, let me go!
I feel sick, oh God, I feel sick!
help, guard, help!
help!
listen, give me a hand... - What happened?
he's not a crab, he's a fag! - A fag?!
Rocca Pizzo station!
the Rome train for Catania-Siracusa...
is arriving on platform 3.
that's it! No discussion! You take the first plane to Rome!
sorry, but if I'm fired, I can stay where I want at my expense.
a smartass, huh? Then I re-hire you, and order you back to Rome!
can I take her with me? - Yes, yes...
I wish! But Pedicò now knows her as my wife, so she has to stay.
commander, let me f-f-f... - Fuck you, period!
let me fix things... I got her into this mess, but I'll get her out...
commander, where are you going? That's the shithouse!
enough foul language! Vanish!
farewell, Coco... - What? We'll meet again!
can I give him a kiss? - Are you crazy?
commander! - Pedicò's coming, vanish!
the first flight, ok? Come...
bye... - Farewell, Coco!
honorable... - I'm going by Rocca Pizzo...
if you'd like a ride...
isn't your secretary coming?
no, he has to go to Rome on urgent business.
it was a lapse...
coming out of the toilet, distracted by certain thoughts...
I went further down the corridor and opened the wrong door.
a terrifying scene!
why not join us for breakfast?
it would be a pleasure. Wouldn't it, Eufemia?
Mary would be happy too...
Thanks, but I have business to attend...
but we always eat late, at 2: 00.
did the silencer fall off your shoes? - What do you care?!
do you know where Albertini lives? - There...
on the second floor.
there he is now!
thanks... I'll give you a tip...
keep the change...
damn that traffic warden!
who is he?!
officer Thisson... Thisson...Thisson... !
This-son-of-a-bitch must have woken up on the wrong foot!
welcome back! I've been waiting two days for you...
for me?
Coco will be back in two days. Don't worry, Mario Albertini.
it's even got Coco's mark...
you're Mr. Robertuzzo. I wrote so you wouldn't worry.
Coco gave me your ad-ad-ad... address...
Where's Coco? - You mean, "Kid Coconut..."
let's go, people get mugged here... - That's nothing, where's Coco?
the Ia-Ia... - Don't sing, I get nervous!
the lady is working on something useful for her career...
right now she's in Sicily. - Ah, Sicily...
people get mugged here all the time...
damn you, what's she doing in Sicily?
I can't say, otherwise our talk will degenerate...
until now it's been so relaxed!
Coco is with my boss, Commander La Noce, pretending to be his wife...
why all the play acting? - So honorable Pedicò can screw her...
there's an honorable involved? So it's a big deal!
I guess so...
you miserable little shit!
you in! Doing business without my permission... I'll kill you!
what lovely fingers you have! Don't waste them on a murder!
OK, enough for today...
if I understood right, you said...
commander La Noce and honorable Pedicò...
Yes, but... now what?
I don't know...an idea will come.
you see my head? It's a factory of ideas!
and you see this? It's an assembly line!
geniuses should give each other a hand!
you're right! - Stop, you don't know who I am!
an asshole. - How did you guess?!
Where's he going?
I took the liberty because I was sure you'd understand, Mrs. La Noce.
I thank you for the information, Mr. Robertuzzo...
but I've stopped being interested in my husband for some time.
maybe I wasn't clear, Mrs. La Noce...
my girl does it for a "living."
she goes with men... I mean...
she's a slut!
still, I feel for her. Dealing with my husband is not pleasant...
madam, let's stick to the facts. Your husband has taken Coco to Sicily...
and introduced her to honorable Pedicò.
an honorable? Why?
he's pretending she's his wife so Pedicò can fuck her!
what? - You understood perfectly...
what a low-life! - You've got it...
Lord, my cup is bitter!
madam, did you add sugar?
he must be stopped, I'll leave immediately!
mine's sweet... - I'll make him pay this time!
I won't take planes. Is there an express to Sicily?
no need... I wouldn't worry if I were you...
my car is a chariot on fire!
OK, you take me. Come back in an hour, I'll be ready to leave!
I'll show everyone the real Mrs. La Noce!
who's that? Mrs. La Noce! - Hi, Robertuzzo...
Hi, what a beautiful woman!
I never imagined you hid such beauty...
you flatter me... - I swear!
strike me dead if I tell a lie... please...
thanks... - Here's my fireball... hop in!
Hi, sorry I'm late. - I just got here myself.
Hey, do you have to park there? Be nice!
actually, she's fucking nice!
you don't say "I fucking love it," you say "I'm enchanted"!
can you get that, or not? Repeat...
I'm enchanted. - Great!
how's it going? - Oh, hi, monsignor.
any progress? - So-so...
she's tries, but she's too "bullheaded."
what do you say?
butthead! - We'll never make it.
I fear you've got the wrong approach, you confuse her with slang...
let's see, so... you don't say "bullhead," nor "butthead."
right, I've heard that...
"Stubborn..."
suppose you're introduced to someone, what do you say?
perfect!
and if they invite you to stay for lunch?
hear that?! She's not bad.
Thanks, I go hoarse for an hour and you play the fresh-faced pedagogue!
Peda-what? - Forget it!
go on, tell the monsignor...
what you say if Pedicò makes that proposal, that one!
Oh, yes...
honorable, go kill yourself dead!
no, Holy Maw! With grace and delicacy!
have you forgotten answer number 6?
you're a very fascinating man...
but I come from an old family and don't have that desire.
you get the idea? I numbered the answers...
now for number 7, to give him hope if he insists...
don't insist, sir, I too am human...
and might forget myself for a moment...
that's a little risky... but I realize it could be useful.
damn, we have to go soon. Let's run over number 1.
good day, please forgive us if we're disturbing your peace...
heavens, it's a real pleasure.
we don't want to be any trouble... - Heavens, Mrs. La Noce...
it's our pleasure. - Commander La Noce.
enchanted, you are a fount of grace and beauty...
thank you... would our guests prefer to be inside or in the garden...
as you wish, we don't give a fuck...
number 3... 3!
it's one o'clock, not 3.
I'm happy either way, whatever you choose is fine...
Carmelo... shall we enjoy the sun in the garden then?
sure, let's keep enjoying the day!
with light like this we can even see Etna!
what a beautiful day...
come and look...
let's go eat, or we'll be late for the Sicily ferry.
OK, Robertuzzo!
where are you going? Come here!
do you like that? Mummy will buy you it...
no, no... I've already bought you that!
no, stop, candy's bad for you...
n's spicy!
he's cute! Can he talk? - If not, I'll take him back!
Hey, he's perfect! He can really piss!
are you stealing my child?!
what a maniac! - He seemed fake.
are you hurt?
not at all! If I don't fall, it's no fun!
hello.
here, your tip...
Thanks.
one day they'll put me on the 100 lira coin!
with a nose like yours, they'll have to add a handle. Get out!
this is my turf, give me the coin and split. Intruders get their ass kicked!
keep the change...
you're very beautiful... - Thank you.
a woman like you could go far, on the road...
I don't think so, I'm lazy...
maybe you misunderstand. Until now you've been a slave.
you should get a life! Make a living of it!
sorry, what do you mean? - Live by it!
if you let me guide you, I'll show you an unimaginable world...
you're much faster than Robertuzzo's car!
he left us standing! You're just waste of fuel!
the water's really hot!
it's the first time I've seen a pool in a condom!
wonderful...
I didn't know you couldn't swim...
I had an old-style education, I don't take to it!
I'll hold you underneath... - Under what?
your back, naturally...Relax, let yourself go.
what a body...blessed be the water...
that embraces you!
very good!
back hand!
now it's my turn! Like that!
back hand!
Marvellous...
excellent...
my ankle... - Did you twist your ankle?
let's hope it's nothing, lean on me... ...
what a sight!
trust me, don't worry. Relax...
how strange, when I was 18 I had the same accident...
my opponent began to massage me, like you're doing...
he was my first love. - What a strange coincidence!
maybe Giambattista Vico was right...
was that his name? - No!
that history course guy...
Ah, right, the things one remembers after years. Well, not so many!
you're very young! - I wouldn't say very young...
don't be immodest, with such beautiful skin...
commander... - Maw, what happened?
nothing, nothing! - Did you fall and hurt yourself?
no, it's nothing, a twisted ankle...
Yes, it's nothing...the commander has a golden touch.
I didn't know you had thaumaturgic skills...
just some practice!
I'm better already, darling...
I'll go and arrange dinner.
naturally our guests are welcome to join us...
Yes, a great idea...
we wouldn't want to trouble you. - It's no trouble!
in fact, they could stay the night. - Maybe they'll be uncomfortable.
there's the guest room, which is always better than a hotel!
Yes, she's right. They'll be just fine...
the guest room, now there's a solution!
go on, you brute! You guzzle gas, then quit on me!
are you hungover, or what?
can't you see your car's smoking?
she's got all the vices, this mechanic's harlot!
white smoke... 'habemus papam'!
Habemus' seized engine!
Marta?
Hey, Marta!
what are you doing? My driving exhausted you!
Yes, a little...
since the ferry leaves tomorrow morning, we'll wait here.
we'll get something to eat, then get some sleep!
Yes, I'm as hungry as a wolf!
a she-wolf!
hungry, huh?
go Robertuzzo, do your worst, this is a great opportunity!
here I am, darling!
this is my bedroom. - Is it?
I always sleep alone...
I sleep alone, my husband has an awful habit of snoring.
aren't you scared? - Yes, even little noise...
and the night is long when spent alone...
you're telling me...
what? But you have a beautiful wife!
she won't talk to me, my wife is frigid... frozen!
Maw? - Yes?
the commander must be tired, we should let him rest...
we were saying... the commander asked...
if tomorrow a trip to Etna would be possible.
Etna? - Yes.
with gusto!
goodnight dear... - Goodnight madam, and thank you...
Goodnight, Maw...
Coco?
what's up now?
what's up? It's night, we're in bed... you're a woman and I'm a man.
Oof...
Coco, if you're getting nowhere with the honorable, at least comfort me!
forget it, I'm tired! - You can't do that!
I don't want to do anything!
but it's ridiculous to sleep. - Have a heart attack!
you've kept me awake for two nights now!
maybe a coffee...
Where's that skunk going?
well... maybe...
of course, I'll bring it to your room in a moment!
thank you, you're very kind. - Oh, it's nothing!
Matilde! - What is it tonight?
what did our guest want? - A coffee.
Ah, he's getting ready. - Shall I make it?
sure... and go get my tranquillizers.
there... a couple of sleeping pills...
that'll put him to sleep, and I
come!
it's sugared. - Thanks.
Coco, wake up!
coffee... - What?
is it time to get up?
no, stay in bed, we're going to do a little exercise...
drink, little one... Nice?
disgusting!
Coco, stop playing around! Don't be a fool!
what's got into you?
how can a woman like you not have blood in her veins?
Coco?
albertini brought me the mummy of Ramses II!
Commander'?
commander... were you taking advantage of an honorable's wife?
sleep, cuckold!
what a fabulous woman!
madam? Madam!
it's Pedicò! Your husband's asleep...
shall we proceed?
you made a vow, huh? I don't like vows...
you made a vow, huh? I don't like vows...
what a woman! How can you sleep next to this fat-assed pachyderm!
is the cuckold upset?
come, I'll take you to my room. Don't worry, I'll handle it...
come with me...
holy Mother!
madam... madam!
what a beautiful woman!
who is it? - Me.
what do you want? - Open, I'm scared!
scared of what?
Oh God, Carmelo! The ghosts!
now it's ghosts!
one moment! - The ghosts!
open Carmelo, there are ghosts!
one moment!
Carmelo, let me in!
what's got into her'?
what is it? - I'm scared, I heard noises.
I saw ghosts in the garden. Let me stay. I'll be quiet!
Carmelo, please! - Damn those ghosts!
I'll wait for you in my room at midnight
now we'll see who's a cuckold, dear Pedicò!
no one stops. Maybe they think I've hurt my thumb?
come, young man... have you been waiting long?
no, I was a child when I got here!
hop in, quick!
thanks... - Buckle up, we're off!
ready, go!
this car's fast, you know? - Right.
where are you going? - Catania.
perfect, I'm going to Sicily too!
listen to that amazing engine? And get the interior!
carpet, air conditioning, a top-end stereo!
put the radio on!
intense traffic has blocked Highway 213...
and thick fog is reported on mountain stretches.
hold tight, we're taking off!
attention all drivers...
police are looking for a Maserati, stolen one hour ago in Naples.
the thief is an escapee from a mental clinic.
he is believed dangerous...
because he's also half blind. We end this news report here.
we return to our light music program.
did you turn the wipers on? They've got two speeds.
fantastic, no?
who's that? - My grandpa!
are you sure this engine's so fabulous?
you're right, young man... at 150mph the spark plugs exploded!
no, it was me... I was shitting my pants!
where are you going? - To the bathroom, for a pee...
you can't. - Why not?
I need to go first, I'm bursting to pee...
I'm bursting too! - But I'm an honorable!
of course, your excellency!
Christ, she's heavy!
after all this effort, should I fuck her twice?
madam, no one will disturb you here, this is my wife's room...
I'll be right back...
madam Mary, I got your message...
it's midnight... madam? I can't see anyone here...
Coco!
what happened? What did that pig do to you?
what happened? You're frozen, what did he do to you?
Oh, mercy! - Madam, it's me, La Noce...
are you crazy? If my husband sees us he'll shoot you!
OK, but not that way, I'm safer leaving by the window...
just go, please! I beg you!
Maw, what are you doing here? - Who is it?!
I was going to my bathroom, you were taking ages!
Really? - Absolutely, Carmelo... come.
go on, the bathroom will be free all night. Get inside.
a man left by the window of your wife's room. You're a cuckold!
I'll make him pay for this!
stop joking, Coco, answer me! There'll be hell to pay if you die!
for a girl like you, it would be criminal!
Coco, answer me! Be good, just one word...
commander... - Thank you, God!
fuck off. - It's Ok, thanks anyway.
take that!
Carmelo! You know I don't like it when you get rough!
I'm full! An empty one is coming behind...
Hey, want a ride?
OK, but you'll have to get in back with the flowers.
what, in the back? - Yes, why?
where the corpse goes?
no one else has claimed it... - But someone might.
who said so? - The newspaper.
"five claimed dead in crash," it said.
go on, slowly... good. - I hurt everywhere.
I can't even touch myself for luck. Would you mind giving me a scratch?
go, Nicola!
Kitty, be ware the big cat! Good day, madam...
good day, honorable. - You're a marvellous woman.
thanks... - I'd do anything for you.
please, I wouldn't want to trouble you...
I'm sorry about last night, but I'm kept under strict control...
my wife is a very jealous woman...
by the way, have you seen her around? - Yes, earlier...
then they went for a hike on the mountain.
they've gone already? She's alone with your husband?
and no one else? - No one...
aren't you jealous of your husband? - I'm a human being too!
we're all human, but aren't you scared something might happen?
well, my husband's "just smoke" these days...
wonderful! His gun's stopped firing!
with me you'll feel you're on the front line!
the lava reached here in '71.
craters can erupt when you least expect it...
it sounds dangerous!
in fact, my husband never comes here, he's scared!
as a child, he very nearly died in an eruption...
are you scared?
with a woman like you, I'm only scared of myself...
commander, what are you saying?
delinquent!
walking on these stones isn't easy...
but don't you love this Dantesque scene?
I have inner fires of my own!
what are you looking at? - I heard a noise...
who knows what it was, I can't see anything!
are you sure you can't see anything? - Madam, you'll catch a cold!
then warm me! - Yes, I'll set you on fire!
not like that, madam!
an eruption!
help!
forgive me, Lord, if I have sinned! Go away!
are you leaving me in this hell?! Wait, madam!
I'm a "respectable" woman!
go away!
stop, wait!
OK, goodbye! - I hope not!
Hi, Coco! Where's the commander?
on the volcano!
wait... blowing this up sure must take a lot of puff!
what happened, did they make you mayor?
no, I got a ride with the undertaker!
how are you, my friend? How lovely to see you!
help, save him!
he's resurfaced! - Help!
I can't swim! - Leave it to me, madam!
hold on!
come on! Here...
come on, up...
not like that, you'll snap his neck!
what a villa! Is anyone home?
he's alive!
the commander... - What do you mean? Explain!
let me go, Marta. - I'm going to kill someone!
are you spying on me?! - What? I can't hear you!
bitch! Is this a vacation, or something?
I take what fucking vacation I feel like! I'm a free woman!
no, you do what I tell you! You owe me respect!
it's me who defends you from being exploited!
quick, my husband will be worried! He'll make a scene!
don't run, take pity on my foot!
if you want to be a slut, you have to take it seriously!
the only slut around here is your sister!
how dare you? - What do you want?!
how dare you raise your voice to a lady!
who the fuck are you? - I'm the fucking master of this house!
go fuck yourself, you fucking chatterbox!
fuck! You don't know who I am!
Oh, my foot!
move your ass!
Marta, how come you're here? And dressed like that?
I came to meet your lover. - How dare you, I demand an apology!
here!
Fetusa! - You bitch!
what are you doing? Stop it!
Albertini, darling, what did they do to you!
enough, you're ladies!
ladies, calm down! This is a respectable house!
shut up, you old whoremonger!
Marta, please, try to understand!
it's a question of business!
I did it to save you from this skunk!
he preys on men's wives, so I brought him a fake wife.
how dare you speak like that!
help! Help!
madam, I'm coming! - It was him!
let him go, I'll deal with him!
this is a kidnapping, I'll see you jailed!
what's that? - A tranquillizer.
I don't want to be tranquillized, I'm a free citizen!
what's broken, doctor?
can't you talk? Are you dumb?
trust me to land the dumb doctor!
I'll make sure you pay for all this!
hear that? You'll pay all damages!
who, me? - Let him be, he's in shock!
I'm the victim of a diabolical plot!
shut up, you prince of shit! - How dare you be informal? !
you, sir, are a prince of shit!
and a cuckold! - That's slander, I've done nothing!
maybe, but he deserves to be a cuckold, and so do you!
what fucking language is this?! Respect the fucking nun, please!
may peace be with you... - And with you too...
you're all reunited... How are you, my son?
fine, compared to my uncle. - How's your uncle?
he's dead!
I don't want no fucking sedatives!
I don't know him... - No one knows me!
tomorrow, you'll find a certain story in the newspaper...
would you like to hear a little preview?
after polluting a river...
with his stinking factory, sought help from an honorable...
who I won't name, but will indicate with a nose!
thank you...
in this dovetailing of social needs and industrial development...
commander La Noce, who you all know...
and Honorable Pedicò, assisting in the political arena...
have succeeded in saving a key source of Italian employment...
...the Straccolone Company, whose products...
are now being sold abroad!
he's a secretary with flair, not like that moron Albertini!
he's so intelligent! - So resourceful...
can't you understand? Night shifts are better than days!
in what sense? - The night shift pays more!
and you only work 5 hours!
plus you can use your daytime hours...
it's delicate... I have to think about it...
there's nothing to discuss, I fear no one...
what you want, you get!
you've decided to work nights, and work nights you will, Ok?!
OK...
bye... - Enjoy.
it's totally dead tonight...
I've only done two cars... - Lucky you!
who's this princess?
what does she want?!
you're off-limits! - Idiot!
look who's talking!
take a hike, or else! - Yeah, move it!
what the fuck do you want from me?!
I'll teach you! You bitches!
what's all this shit?
and who's he?
listen daddy, this is Franceschino's turf!
Franceschino? Who's Franceschino?
who the fuck is Franceschino? Who is he?!
Frankie, show yourself...
Franceschino, don't hurt me! - Fuck off!
No!
Franceschino, you killed him!
come on...
did you get the license number?
come on, darling, come...
the END
this FILM IS A WORK OF FICTION.
we're SORRY IF THERE IS ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REAL PEOPLE OR INCIDENTS.
keep it. -Thank you.
never been on a bike?
Mmm-mmm.
never.
you got to wear one of these.
okay.
you've got to hold on tight right there.
here we go. You ready?
I'm ready. -You sure?
Yeah.
Hey, babe, relax. She'll be back when she gets back.
quit telling me to relax. Okay?
what the fuck?
Wow. Funny how someone conveniently forgot to tell me that they were driving home on a motorcycle.
do you know how many people I've seen come into the hospital paralyzed from motorcycle accidents?
I'm a very safe driver, Nic.
Yeah, that is so not the point that I'm making, Paul.
Joni knows that this is something I'd just never allow.
mom, I'm 18 years old.
yeah?
I won't even be living here in, like, a month.
Yeah, well, you're living here now. Yeah?
well, why don't you get a jump on it and pretend like I'm not?
she's never talked to me like that before.
you know, if you backed off a little bit on the restrictions, you probably wouldn't have so much conflict.
Oh, really? You think so, Paul? Is that how it works?
Jules: What's going on?
Oh, nothing. Nothing.
Paul's just giving me some child-rearing lessons.
I'm just saying...
listen, when you've been a parent for 18 years, you come and talk to me, okay?
I'm just making an observation.
yeah? Well, I need your observations like I need a dick in my ass!
Nic: Joni?
honey. Look, I was upset, okay?
you know how I feel about motorcycles.
Yeah, I know how you feel about them.
but I'm an adult now, and you have to respect that, okay?
good night.
good? Good?
Yeah, that's perfect. Thanks.
Hey, Paul.
Hey, Jules. What's up?
it's all right. I just wanted to say I'm sorry about last night.
hey... I was really embarrassed.
Hey, it wasn't you. It was her who wigged out.
I think she's, you know, she's just having a really hard time.
you know?
Yeah. You really don't have to defend her. Seriously.
and about that kiss, that's... You know, I don't do that.
I completely sensed that, yeah.
so...
I just wanted to clear the air.
the air is cleared.
no, it's clear.
no, Paul, I can't!
Why? You don't want to?
no, I have a guy outside!
Oh, yeah. Right, the guy.
Oh, God.
okay, wait. Wait.
well! Hello!
Yeah! Yeah!
okay, not so hard. Not so hard. Okay.
what?
Oh, my God! Paul: Yeah?
come on.
Luis: Excuse me?
you gotta be fucking kidding me!
paul: Oh, God. Oh, God.
I can't fucking believe it. Okay.
you gotta go talk to him. Are you gonna go talk to him?
okay. Fuck. Oh, God.
shit.
Hey, what's up?
where do you want the stones?
stones?
over by the fence.
what?
I was using the bathroom.
do you need to use the bathroom?
okay, then. I'll be right back.
okay. Take your time.
Yeah, I know.
all right. Lay-up.
paul: All right.
now you don't have to go easy on me because you're winning.
nobody likes a show-off, man.
you gotta go behind the back.
God.
can I ask you a question?
would you rather be buried or cremated?
that's your question?
I'd rather be cremated.
I think I'd...
I think I'd rather be buried.
but why? I mean, you're just gonna be taking up more space in the earth.
I don't know. The idea of being, you know, torched into a chalky white substance has got me a little freaked out.
why does it matter to you? You're not even gonna be conscious.
okay, well, maybe, I don't know,
I want a place for people to come and visit me one day.
but why? You're gonna be dead.
you won't even know they're there.
okay. Take it easy.
come on.
so, what do you like better, Nike or New Balance?
nike. Oh, God, here we go.
Sasha: God, I love your necklace! Can I see it?
sure.
it's so beautiful.
thank you.
is it African?
Yes, it's Ethiopian.
did you get it there?
no, I got it at a flea market in Brooklyn.
is that where you're from?
no, I'm from here.
cool. Hey, guys, how you doing?
good. -How's the food?
it's great.
good? You're not gonna eat your chicken?
it's so yummy. -It's good?
Yeah, it's really good.
I'm sorry, but I have to take the lovely Tanya away for a moment.
all right. It was lovely talking to you, ladies.
you, too. -You, too.
okay, I'm sorry, but your donor daddy is giving me the sex vibe.
no, he's not. He wouldn't do that.
why not? He's not my dad.
God, Sasha, that's totally gross!
not everybody wants to have sex with you, okay?
especially when you act like a slut.
fuck you.
well, it makes you seem insecure and desperate.
I'm not insecure and desperate.
I'm just a normal, sexual person.
maybe you'd understand that if you weren't so uptight.
fuck you. I'm not uptight.
Stella: Oh, my God, these heirloom tomatoes are amazing.
Oh, yeah, they're in season.
you know, Joni brought some home from Paul's garden the other day.
they were huge.
so the kids have been spending time with him?
Yeah. Yeah, they're spending all kinds of quality time together.
well, you're lucky. You're lucky that the kids bonded with the donor.
I mean, you hear so many nightmare stories.
no, no, it's great. They all just get along famously.
apparently, Paul can do no wrong.
excuse me. Could we get another bottle of the Seavey Cabernet?
thank you. I'm okay. I'm okay. I don't need any more.
Yeah, you're alone on this one, Nicole.
Hey, so have you guys gotten into the whole acai smoothie craze?
Jules: Acai fruit packs.
Yeah. No, but they're pushing them like crack at Whole Foods.
joel is so addicted to it. He buys it by the case.
Joel: Here's what I do.
I throw one in the blender with bananas, frozen strawberries and hemp milk.
and I'll tell you what, it is pretty sensational.
just fucking kill me. Okay?
honey. I'm sorry, guys, but I just can't with the fucking hemp milk and the organic farming.
and, you know, if I hear one more person say that they love heirloom tomatoes,
I'm gonna fucking kill myself. Okay?
Oh. And do you know that we're composting now?
Oh, yeah. "No, don't throw that in the trash.
you have to put it in the composting bin "where all the beautiful little worms will turn it into this organic mulch, and then we'll all feel good about ourselves." You know?
I can't do it, okay? I can't fucking do it.
Hey, babe. How about some green tea?
you know what, Jules? I like my wine, okay? So fucking sue me.
and FYI, red wine has a chemical called resveratrol in it, which has been proven to significantly extend human lifespan.
if you drink, like, a thousand glasses a day, yeah.
fuck you.
I'm sorry. -Stella: It's okay.
go to her.
what the hell is going on with them?
Oh, my God. What is going on with you?
it's this whole Paul thing.
it's just driving me crazy, all right?
I feel like he's taking over my family.
no. He's...
BARTENDER: Can I get you anything?
no thanks, no. He's not. He's not.
okay.
okay, I'm sorry, all right?
I guess I'm just exhausted.
Yeah, maybe you just need to take some time off, recharge.
right?
Yeah, right. Who's gonna pay for that?
I mean, look, I'm sorry, but, you know, I feel like I'm carrying the whole load here.
Yeah, 'cause that's the way you like it.
that's the way you keep control.
what are you talking about?
come on, you hated it when I worked.
you wanted me at home taking care of the kids.
you wanted a wife. -That is just not true.
no, you didn't like any of the nannies, and you sure didn't back my career.
what are you talking about? I just helped you start another business.
Yeah, so you can feel better about yourself.
no, Jules. So you can feel better about yourself.
are you even attracted to me anymore?
BARTENDER: Would you still like the wine?
Nic: No, thank you. We'll just take the check from inside, please.
Bartender： Okay, no problem.
Oh, yeah. Pull my hair.
paul: Okay. Oh, yeah.
paul: Ow!
I really want a cigarette. I haven't smoked since Laser was born.
do you smoke? Do you have a cigarette?
sometimes, but I don't have any.
I could go run out and get you some.
Yeah. Yeah, no, no. No, don't go.
do you think
I'm some sad-sack, middle-aged lesbian?
you know, I have been trying to come up with a way to describe you to my friends, and now I finally have it. Thank you so much.
fuck you.
you don't want to get that?
no, no. I want to get some of this.
Paul, it's Joni.
I just wanted to call you and apologize for my friend Sasha.
you know, when you put your hands on her shoulders,
I think that she thought that...
Hey, Joni. It's Paul. -Don't get that.
listen, I'm really sorry about Sasha the other night.
no, I didn't even... No, no. No... Really, I didn't even notice that.
I hope you didn't feel uncomfortable.
no, not at all. I...
not at all.
okay, sure. Well, as long as... -Hold on, hold on.
wait, wait, wait.
no, just get off me.
I'm just gonna... Give me one second.
get off.
Joni?
Oh, is my mom there?
your mom? No, no. She split.
she went on a Home Depot run.
did you go to Home Depot?
Yeah. Just got back.
that was fast.
Yeah, no lines.
what's that look you're giving me?
what look?
the look that you're giving me right now.
no. That's no look. That's just my face.
Yeah, I'm not gonna play this game with you.
you know, you can keep your judgments to yourself.
I don't ask why you blow your nose all the time.
if you have a drug problem, then that's your business.
no, I don't have a drug problem.
I have allergies.
then why are you a gardener?
cause I love the flowers.
man, this is not gonna work.
you know, I'm gonna pay you through the end of the day, and then we're through. Okay?
thank you very much.
Thanks. Thank you.
can we talk about...
no, we can't.
Luis: A little bit. You know why?
cause there's nothing to talk about.
I think you know.
you know.
look.
I know you've all been enjoying your time with Paul.
and I know that I haven't been as open to him as everybody else, and that's caused some friction between us.
but I'd like to try and change that, okay?
so I was thinking it might be nice if we all had dinner at his house sometime.
now that way, I could get to know him a little bit better, and I could see all the good work that Mom's been doing in the backyard.
what do you think? -Yeah? Sure.
Nic: Yeah. Sure.
yeah?
Joni: Yeah.
great.
it's not... I'm not done yet.
you know, I'm not, you know...
no. No, I know.
I haven't done all the planting or anything.
but I wanna see the process.
you know, like other colors, other than green colors.
well, that's okay. I just wanna see the process.
great.
need a hand? Jules: Sure.
hold on. Let me help you.
ready? Okay.
right here.
we can't be doing this.
I know. This is...
I'm married.
the kids.
Yeah, and I love Nic, so...
Hey. I don't...
it was fun while it lasted.
sorry.
I bought you some cigarettes.
Jesus. What is wrong with me?
I shouldn't have fired Luis like that. That was so wrong.
Yeah, I think you're being hard on yourself.
you know, I mean, things just get messed up sometimes.
no, no, that wasn't messy. That was fucked up.
I am so fucked up.
I think I'm falling for you.
Oh, God, Paul.
don't.
tonight was a really good night.
Yeah.
that one table had, like, five bottles of wine.
it was crazy. It was a big night.
you know, Joni's really pretty.
I think she's got some of your genes.
you think? I think she looks more like her mom, but thanks.
I appreciate that.
it was really cute seeing you in dad mode.
yeah?
Yeah.
it made me want to fuck you.
yeah?
Yeah.
you know, I've been missing our sleepovers.
Yeah, we haven't been doing that in a while, have we?
you want to meet up later?
Tanya, you're so sexy and beautiful, but I...
I don't think we should do that anymore.
you know, what we have is really fun and easy, but I don't want to be that, like, 50-year-old guy who's just hanging out, you know?
I really do want to have a family, and I need to be doing that with someone who's, like, ready to go there with me.
okay.
Tanya.
yeah? Fuck you.
it's locked.
Yeah, I mean, obviously I have more to do down here.
I gotta fill it in, but this is the general idea.
no, it looks great.
yeah?
it's so indigenous.
really. I am so proud of you.
Yeah, you like it? Yeah?
I'm so proud.
I love you, honey.
I love you, too.
I'm so glad you like it. -It's incredible.
Oh, man.
and now, wait, how's that guy Luis working out?
man, I had to fire him.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, he has a drug problem.
you're kidding! What drug?
no. I know... I...
blow, I think.
you're a natural, kid.
Jules I know. Paul: Good.
you're a natural.
you can never have too much olive oil.
big no-no.
Oh! I forgot.
NIC, I got a bitching 1998 Alma Rosa that I think you're just gonna love.
you know what? I think I'm gonna stick with water, but thank you so much.
you sure? Yeah.
Jules.
Nic: Paul, this steak is delicious.
paul: Thank you.
really, it's... What is the seasoning?
guys, we just misted it with a little truffle oil, right?
Mmm-hmm.
paul: It's so easy. Nic: Wow.
what a good idea. We ought to try that. Right, honey?
Mmm-hmm.
and it's done to perfection.
yeah? It's not too rare?
Oh, no, no.
it's juicy and tender. Exactly what rare's supposed to be.
right? I mean, I got people coming into the restaurant, they see the slightest bit of red, they just start freaking out.
isn't that annoying?
that happens to me all the time when I'm grilling.
paul: Hey, red is rare.
Hello, it's bloody.
I mean... Hello?
yoo-hoo. Hello, thank you.
Yeah, I mean, if you're in Argentina, and you ask for rare, they bring you a cow still mooing on the plate.
I really want to go to Argentina. Buenos Aires is supposed to be...
Hey. I noticed your record collection over there.
wow, it's quite an eclectic mix, you know.
thank you very much, Nic.
you're welcome.
you don't meet too many straight guys who love Joni Mitchell.
you sure don't.
you like Joni?
no, not really. We just named our daughter after her.
Really? Oh, shut the front door.
come on. Really? You never told me you were named after Joni M.
it's so dorky. I don't like to bring it up.
that is so cool.
no, what's your favorite Joni album? -It's not cool.
blue.
right? My brother from another mother.
Oh, my God. I mean...
listen, I spent half of high school in my room crying to that album.
that record, it kills me.
it doesn't stop. -No.
river. California.
a Case Of You.
all I Want.
Nic: Oh, God. Paul： Right?
I am on a lonely road
and I am traveling, traveling, traveling
looking for something
paul and Nic: What can it be
I hate you some, I hate you some
I love you some
I love you
both When I forget about me
I want to talk to you
I want to shampoo you
I want to renew you again and again
applause, applause
life is our cause
when I think of your kisses
my mind see-saws
do you see, do you see
do you see, do you see
do you see how you hurt me, baby
and I hurt you, too
that's why we both get so blue
paul: Bravo.
don't quit your day job, Mom.
paul: Hey. It's already hard enough to open your heart in this world.
don't make it any harder.
you're right. I'm sorry. It was a wonderful rendition.
beautiful, thank you.
I like this guy.
paul: Why, thank you, Nic.
okay. Paul, where's your bathroom?
it's just right here around the corner.
all right. Thanks.
and you know what? I am gonna have a glass of the Alma Rosa, okay?
all right.
so, I think you'd really love Argentina.
Joni: I really wanna go there.
paul: Buenos Aires is literally, like, one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
paul: I was in a rainstorm in the Grand Canyon.
Joni: Can we go? -I'll take you.
paul: A big rattlesnake when I was in the desert in Baja, Mexico.
we should. I'll take you to Baja.
I was in the desert and...
Joni: What's it like there?
paul: It's beautiful.
I was surfing, but then there was no waves, so we climbed up into the mountains.
and I hear a rattling, and it was a rattlesnake.
and so I was scrambling. I didn't know what to do, so I reached out for a rock, and then I threw it at the rattlesnake...
did you guys spend some time up there?
Yeah, a long time ago. Yeah. Yeah.
beautiful, beautiful beaches. You'd like it.
paul: It's really nice having you guys over.
I don't entertain here very much.
Cheers.
Jules: All right. -All right.
to an unconventional family.
you and Paul were getting along like gang-busters.
you're sleeping with him, aren't you?
what?
just be honest with me, okay?
don't make me feel crazier than I feel right now.
where is this coming from? I don't...
well, I found your hair in his drain.
because...
because I was working, and I got dirty, and I took a shower.
yeah? Did you take a nap, too?
are you in love with him?
no.
are you straight now?
no. It has nothing to do with that!
I've just felt so far away from you lately.
Oh, right. So it's my fault?
No! Who said anything about fault?
just listen to me!
I'm listening!
what?
I just... I just...
I needed...
what? To be fucked?
no. Appreciated.
well, it's always what I'm not doing for you, isn't it?
well, okay. Here's what I don't do to you.
I don't work out my issues by fucking other people!
he's not just "other people."
No! He's our sperm donor.
you couldn't have picked a more painful way to hurt me.
where are you going?
I need water!
Oh!
shit!
shit.
Joni.
I don't want to talk to you.
can we just talk about what happened?
I said I don't want to talk to you.
okay. I understand.
laser? Honey?
what?
I know that you and Joni heard what was going on, and I wanted to tell you that what happened with me and Paul is over.
there's nothing going on now.
okay.
I know it'll probably take you a while to process your feelings around this, but I just wanted to tell you that I'm here if you ever want to talk about anything.
is there anything you want to talk about?
not really.
how's Nic?
she's a mess.
they're not talking. I've never seen her like that.
is it him?
Hello?
Hey, darling. How you doing?
you're such a phony.
excuse me?
you act like you're so groovy and together, but you're not.
you're a shitty person!
Oh, no.
what happened?
with my mom?
listen, you gotta let me just come and talk to you, honey, please.
what's wrong with you?
Joni, listen to me. Please...
don't call me again.
Hey, Paul, look at these cukes. Aren't they awesome?
no.
fuck.
fuck!
Jules: Hello?
I just talked to Joni.
what happened? What's going on?
NIC found my hair in your bathroom.
fuck. In the drain.
the other night?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Hey, you know what?
I just say we go for it. I mean, it's all out in the open now.
I mean, let's just do this thing.
Paul...
I don't care what you say, Jules. We can...
this can work, you know. This isn't a mistake.
Paul.
this isn't just happening for no reason.
let's get the kids together.
Paul, come on. I'm sick of this life.
let's make this happen. I'm ready.
I'm gay.
fuck it. I wanna...
Jesus.
Hello?
Hey, hey. Slow down, tiger.
you don't wanna get sick.
I'm fine.
are you gonna talk to him?
Yeah.
Hey. -Hey.
I like the scruff. It's sexy.
thank you.
excuse me. We're in the middle of a conversation.
that's okay.
can I talk to you?
Yeah.
excuse me.
man: Green chilies, queso sauce, blue corn tortillas.
this is a poblano pepper.
so, what's up?
are you okay?
fine.
I just wanted to get another pillow. The couch is really saggy.
your back hurts?
Yeah. It's super achy.
well, you should take some Advil.
Hey, how was the party?
fine.
were there a lot of people there?
I don't know.
are you drunk, honey?
no.
Hey, did you drive yourself home?
Yeah. What's the big deal? I'm not drunk.
you seem drunk to me.
Yeah, well, you should know.
what did you say to me?
nothing. I'm going to bed. Nic: Hey, honey. I...
what do you want from me? I did everything you wanted!
I got all A's! I got into every school I applied!
now you can show everyone what a perfect lesbian family you have!
don't talk to your mom like that!
you're really gonna tell me how to act? Now?
you know what? I am still your mother, and you...
don't touch me! I'm so sick of both of you!
Hey, did you remember to pack the lamp I gave you?
Mmm-hmm.
well, we can always get stuff there, you know.
I mean, if your room's too dark, or you need extra bedding or...
I'm not going to Siberia, Mom.
I can't believe it's your last dinner at home.
are you seriously about to cry?
I wish you were gay. You'd be much more sensitive.
that's probably Sasha. I'll get it.
laser: How long a drive is it?
Nic: About eight hours, I think.
what are you doing here?
I just needed to talk to you before you left. Please.
there's nothing to talk about.
I wanted to apologize again.
I can't tell you how ashamed, how much I regret what happened.
so, like, everything that happened between us, what was that? That was just bullshit?
no, no. It wasn't bullshit at all.
okay?
I know that I don't have much credibility right now, but I really, really care about you.
and I wanna know that I'm gonna be able to see you again someday.
I mean, I... Do you think that could ever happen?
I don't know.
I just wish that you could've been...
what?
better.
Oh.
you have got some balls, mister.
hold on, Nic.
no, no, no. You hold on.
you know what you did to my kids?
shit.
let me tell you something, man, this is not your family.
this is my family! -I know that, Nic.
no, you don't know.
you don't know, and you know why?
because you're a fucking interloper.
if you want a family so much, you go out and make your own!
I need to say something.
it's no big secret your mom and I are in hell right now, and...
bottom line is, marriage is hard.
it's really fucking hard.
just two people slogging through the shit, year after year, getting older, changing.
it's a fucking marathon, okay?
so, sometimes, you know, you're together so long, that you just...
you stop seeing the other person.
you just see weird projections of your own junk.
instead of talking to each other, you go off the rails and act grubby and make stupid choices, which is what I did.
and I feel sick about it because I love you guys, and I love your mom, and that's the truth.
sometimes you hurt the ones you love the most. I don't know why.
you know, if I read more Russian novels, then...
anyway...
I just wanted to say how sorry I am for what I did.
I hope you'll forgive me eventually.
thank you.
Nic: Oh!
nice, huh? -This is big.
it's bigger than I thought it would be.
okay.
did you remember the lamp? Thank God. -JULES: Here it is. Here.
honey, where do you want this?
do you want it on your desk? Do you want it next to the bed?
guys, I've got it.
I think the sheets are in here. Mom.
guys, I can do it, okay? No, no, I can do it.
mom.
Jules: Is that...
mom, I got it. I can do it.
Thanks. Can I just have a minute, please? Okay?
okay. Okay.
okay?
okay.
great.
Hey.
Where'd you guys go?
Nic: We had to move the car.
I thought you left.
we wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
give us some credit.
it's gonna be weird not having you around anymore.
sorry to leave you alone with them.
it'll be okay.
Hey, guys, come on.
Hey, it's okay. I'll speak to you soon, okay?
okay.
I don't think you guys should break up.
no? Why's that?
I think you're too old.
Nic: Thanks, Laser.
you and someone had a kid, you gave up that kid, I am that kid and now I'm applying for emancipation.
from the people who adopted you?
from foster care.
um, Cate Cassidy - that's your mom.
I am Cate Cassidy.
Ryan and I has been up since 5: 00.
and, as usual, arguing since 6: 00.
Hey, what are you doing? - Will you marry me?
meet Lux, our daughter.
you never even told me I've got a kid out there.
why would I? You wouldn't even admit that she existed.
I am not granting you emancipation.
I'm releasing you back into their temporary joint custody.
bug, what are you doing?
giving your new friends a night they won't forget.
Hey!
what happened? Where's Lux?
her boyfriend stole my car.
what? I'm calling the police.
Oh, my God.
there has to be a better way of waking up than this.
I can think of one.
okay. I'm going to be right back.
I can't do morning sex with morning breath.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
what are you doing?
what does it look like? Hey.
eyes forward. What's going on?
what? What? Oh, no, no, no.
this is not okay.
did you sleep here again?
again? - Yeah, Lux and I were watching TV.
Hey, did you know that The Real World is still on?
she's never even seen it.
I passed out during Hawaii, woke up to San Diego.
there coffee?
I'll get rid of him.
looks like Baze is making himself right at home.
how long has this been going on?
Oh. Last week or two.
you're up early.
what's with the iron? Is it school picture day?
bug's arraignment.
for the whole stealing Jones's car unfortunate-ness.
I mean, he eats here, sleeps here, pees here.
wait. Are you skipping school? - Baze got Lux in a car accident...
because you cannot miss school.
Baze said I could.
he lets her bartend at his loft.
I mean, what's-what's next?
you two going to get arrested and thrown in jail together?
Oh, wait. That already happened.
I'll be doing upstairs stuff.
look... a month ago, I had no idea Baze existed.
now, suddenly, he's spending nights here.
look, the last person that I'm going to defend is Baze.
I want to check my couch for drool marks.
I just want less Baze in our lives.
does that make me a bad guy?
it makes you like the rest of us.
you're up early.
never went to bed.
guess you didn't, either.
up top.
it wasn't like that.
I was hanging with Lux and...
kind of fell asleep at Cate's.
again?
dude, it was a matter of time before this whole dad thing killed your game.
what?
I got game?
you used to be the king of the random hookup.
like Wilt Chamberlain, only shorter.
and... whiter.
now look at you.
you're... Math.
I take offense to that.
the last time I had sex was 22 minutes ago.
you?
and I'm not talking Tracey. Ex-girlfriends don't count.
I'm talking random, meaningless, "I don't remember exactly what happened" sex.
okay.
but you cannot tell Math.
16 years ago doesn't count.
no, a month ago.
when Lux first showed up.
what?
do you have a death wish or something?
dude, why would you go there?
there's plenty of sex to be had that isn't so loaded.
you don't need to re-screw the girl you already screwed.
it just happened.
things like that don't just happen.
unless you...
you have a thing for Cate.
no, I don't. - Yes, you do.
no, I don't.
there is no thing.
okay. All right.
then, prove it.
sleep with someone else. - Fine.
but don't call me Math.
so, I'm confused.
I just started listening. So, you and Cate have a kid together?
Oh, no, no, no. Baze and I have a kid.
I'm sorry. Who's Blaze?
Baze. He's not a pony.
and that's who you got engaged to?
no. Ryan and I- we are engaged.
thanks for calling, Kathy.
does anyone have a question that is not about Baze?
how about, uh, Denise from West Linn?
Hey, Ryan. I love you.
I can't believe you and Cate are engaged.
I didn't think she'd ever stop skanking around.
right here, Denise.
so, when's the wedding?
we have not picked a date yet.
summer's nice. - If you want to be a big giant cliche, yeah
I mean, why do people want to pigeonhole you and stuff you into this... this little box to confine you to this one date that you arbitrarily pick because that's the opening that the Holiday Inn ballroom has available? I mean, come on.
you know what I mean, Denise, right?
Denise? - Uh, yeah. Denise, she hung up.
okay. Fine. Let me start from the beginning.
I'm just saying, first, you're single, and everyone wants to know when you're going to find someone,
you know, they constantly regardless of whether the person is actually right for you.
what? - So, this is you not hung up on Cate?
I told you, I'm not. I mean, do you hear her?
who'd be hung up on that?
it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and...they start talking babies...
she's grating, right? Her voice?
Yes, yes.
it's like seagulls fighting over a cheese sandwich.
funny. - Thanks.
so, um, do you... do you...
do you come here often?
is this you picking me up?
well, this... s-s-sort of, maybe.
I'm not from here.
okay.
shut up.
I've got a venti, no foam, no whip, not gettg any for the big guy right here.
this is crap, man. I'm not taking a plea.
you know, most people facing two years in prison would think six months is a pretty good deal.
Oh, you mean the other clients you don't give a rat's ass about?
he didn't steal the car.
I was borrowing it.
that's not what the plaintiff says.
the plaintiff is a brownnosing pretty boy.
and what, I'm going to go to jail on his say-so?
you know, I got to get to my next case.
when you figure it out, you let me know.
bug, this isn't juvie court.
you could go to jail for two years.
you would be 20, and-and I'd be 18.
I know it sucks, but you have to take the plea.
for us.
I got a better idea.
my idiot attorney says if Jones doesn't testify, then there's no case.
how are you going to get him not to?
I'm not. You are.
come on, Lux.
talk to Jones. For us.
we have a serious problem.
corporate is here.
what?
corporate is here. They flew in from Chicago last night, but no one bothered to tell me...
Hey, guys. - Hey!
how are you guys? Hey. - Oh, it's so good to see you.
thank God. When I saw you guys coming, I was so worried that Trina was...
Hey, Trina.
it... it's been forever.
nine months since I last saw you.
you actually remember.
it's hard to forget you getting drunk at a corporate retreat and knocking over an ice sculpture.
well, this is a...a rare treat.
since you don't usually oversee our show.
only when there's a problem.
what's the problem?
not what.
who.
so, there's good news and bad news.
the good news...is people still love Ryan.
as for Cate...
three weeks ago, you were K-100's single, sharp-tongued darling.
two weeks ago, you're an unwed mother of a rescue teen.
today, you are half of an engaged couple who won't pick a wedding date, who spends an inordinate amount of time talking about some guy named Blaze.
Baze. Uh, his name- it's Baze.
I don't care if his name is Brad Pitt,
george Clooney, and the big eyebrow dude from Twilight.
thanks to you, the audience is completely confused.
do you know what people who tune in do when they get confused?
they tune out.
we need to clear up this confusion.
people need a Who's Who to understand the manscape that is your life.
if we don't, your partnership with Ryan at least on air- is over.
Hey, look, it's Slumdog.
I can wait here while you talk to him.
or come back later. - You can wait here.
sup, Prison Break?
Yeah, bite me, asshat!
or come back later.
great party last weekend, huh?
you know, minus the whole car debacle.
debacle means...
I know what it means.
so I need to talk to you about something.
like a favor.
the charges against Bug- I- I need you to drop them.
you're kidding, right?
just?
look...
I know that you don't know him, and you don't know me.
and yeah, maybe he made a mistake, a big one.
but he doesn't deserve to go to jail or have a record follow him around for the rest of his life.
I'll do anything.
I will wash your car for a year... anything.
just... let Bug off the hook.
okay.
but he's got to pay for what he did.
how about I take that bike?
what bike?
bug's motorcycle.
the Norton?
my dad took my Jeep. Punishment for partying.
I need wheels, and Bug's got two good ones.
he'd never give that bike up.
his dad gave him that.
I guess we'll see what matters more: the bike or you.
she had tables and graphs and everything.
I mean, I have never...I've never had my likeability put on a pie chart.
I mean, she couldn't actually split us up, could she?
she could fire us. - What would I do?
teach community college?
I could do voice-overs for feminine hygiene products.
I mean, I have no transferable skills.
do you remember when she said that my voice gave her night blindness?
well, she's got a way with words.
this makes walking in on Baze peeing this morning seem pretty harmless.
actually, this makes Baze peeing where we live highly symbolic because you would rather talk about him than pick a wedding date.
are you serious right now?
that you can't go two seconds without bringing up his name?
it's not exactly less Baze, Cate.
you guys, Trina wants to talk to us. Now.
Hey, I-I'm looking for a, uh...
coffee lady?
bedhead troller?
you clean up well.
and apparently don't take no for an answer?
hmm. I'm here to see a, uh...
she just called me.
wait a second.
you're who I just spoke to on the phone?
I can't believe this.
you're Baze?
no. This-This is not happening.
this is not an option.
Trina, you said so yourself, all right?
we need less confusion. People want less of this guy, not more.
like I said, our audience needs to understand where Cate stands with the men in her life.
Cate, Ryan, meet your cohost for tomorrow's show.
Hi. I'm Cate. And this is Morning Madness
can't believe you get up this early every day.
I cannot believe that you're really going through with this.
well, believe it, lady.
Trina's letting me promote my bar on the air.
she's scratching my back, and if I'm lucky, I'm gonna scratch hers.
you disgust me.
this what we're reading from?
you two, just hit all the talking points and take caller questions.
Baze, be yourself.
sound good? Great.
and you're on in five...
good morning, Portland.
you're joining Morning Madness with Cate and Ryan.
now, as most of you know, a lot of stuff has come out about us lately, and by us, I mean mostly Cate.
Ah, a teen pregnancy, estranged daughter, secret engagement.
just another day at the office.
so to clear up the Days of Our Lives episode that is Cate's life, we have a very special guest.
the source of much of this confusion, the mystery man from the minivan... And, proprietor of Open Bar, a hopping joint on Third and Clover.
...Mr. Nate Bazile.
or as the Portland P. D. fondly refer to him, Baze.
what up, Portland...!
thanks for taking me to school.
you'll never believe what Baze is doing.
what happened with Jones?
well, he said he'd drop the charges...
But?
but you have to give him your bike.
screw that.
we're talking about jail.
Yeah, I know, but...
you told me to do this for us, and I did, so now what? I don't get it.
your bike is more important than us?
you think Abercrombie even knows how to ride?
you recently found out about the daughter you and Cate had together, and you reached out to Cate.
what was that reunion like with her?
well, Ryan, my feelings were mixed.
I mean, part of me felt like I'd just been kicked in the gut.
but at the same time, I sort of felt like I'd been punched in the face.
I guess what I'm trying to say is, she's mean.
okay, um, let's just remind everyone that you had just ambushed me on air.
you had told the entire greater Portland area that I was pregnant in high school.
Oh, please. You're a human ambush.
you ambush on autopilot like a ninja.
Ryan, back a brother up.
Ah, do you ever just listen to yourself?
you don't even make any sense. You're not even saying anything.
see? Mean.
great. Can you hold, please?
heads up.
bike's out front.
now we're even.
okay, let's go to the phones.
we have Jesse from Greenway on the line.
Jesse, what is your question?
I'd like to know how it started. Did you guys go out in high school?
Oh, God, no. No.
I was popular, athletic. Popular.
Cate's best friend was a dictionary.
she went to prom with a thesaurus.
Really? And who'd you go with?
herpes simplex 2?
no. What I'm saying is she wasn't exactly my type.
Yeah, because I had standards and a brain.
you're right.
bookworm virgin with padded bras?
way hotter.
I was going to cut the rest of classes.
help me start it, and I'll give you a ride.
with the guy who stole my boyfriend's bike?
Thanks, but no.
I just called my dad.
told him I wasn't going to testify.
bug's off the hook. Okay? No jail.
you're a real hero.
Hey, I'm not the bad guy here.
that's your boyfriend.
get on the back.
what are you doing?
I want to show you something.
you know why we didn't hang in high school? 'Cause you were scared.
scared of what?
okay, so Cate, you have one kid, but now with Baze in your life...
cause I was the kind of girl that could see right through you.
...It's like you have two.
the only thing I was scared of was your corrective head gear.
Oh, my God. Exhibit A: Any time a real issue is brought up,
it was gone by junior year!
and we have an anonymous caller for Baze again.
I'd like to agree with Cate. Baze sounds like he's deflecting.
thank you.
almost like he's sexually frustrated.
Jamie, is that you?
we have got another caller.
Lorena from Hillsboro.
I just want to say, best show ever.
I love the two of you.
Oh, well, thank you. Thank you so much.
Ryan and I- we-we aim to please.
I meant you and Baze.
you have crazy chemistry, and it sure doesn't sound like things ended in high school.
Oh, my God, no way. - Uh, just once.
once was more than anyone should ever have to go through.
one time. Uno.
turns out I'm the biggest idiot around.
okay, I get that you're mad. I get it.
I've-I've been a nice guy, right?
I've been a good guy?
Yeah, you are an amazing guy.
I was patient and understanding when you treated my marriage proposal like a joke.
when Lux moved in, when that-that... that dumb ape, Baze, started messing with our personal and public lives,
I took it like a freaking champ.
now, all I asked for was a little less of him, and now, he's in my booth, in my station, screwing with my career
something I have worked at my entire life.
right. So have I.
I did not want Baze on the show either.
Kate, you're the reason he is.
thanks to your fixation over him over the last few weeks, all of Portland is-is confused about Cate and Ryan.
and you know what?
so am I.
whoa, what are we talking about?
do you have feelings for him, for Baze?
what? - Come on, Cate.
come on, the night of that turtle thing,
I saw, I saw the two of you sitting at his bar.
okay, I saw how you were together.
are... are you kidding me?
no, I'm not.
and that look between you two just now when, when Lorena from Hillsboro called and asked you that question?
has anything ever happened between you guys since high school?
Ryan, no, nothing has happened.
I mean, you believe me, right?
honestly?
Yeah.
I don't know what I believe anymore.
not exactly Nob Hill, right?
what are we doing here?
this house that's where Bug grew up.
what? Am I supposed to feel sorry for him?
come on.
bug's dad's in jail - dealer turned convict.
I don't think we should be back here.
when Bug was nine, his mom OD'd while he was playing in the yard back here.
she was okay eventually, but she checked out of his whole childhood and let his dad beat the crap out of him until Child Protective Services took Bug away.
so, then, why does he want to keep that bike if it was his dad's?
listen.
a while ago, I got placed in this foster home out in Gresham.
it was as bad as this place.
this one Christmas, the mom - she was... awful.
but she gave me this locket.
it was cheap costume jewelry that someone had given her and she didn't want, but I wore it until it broke and fell off my neck.
I guess I held on to it because I don't know. It's...It's better than having nothing.
and that's what Bug has: nothing.
he can have his bike back.
okay?
he can have it.
I don't even want it anymore.
Really?
you'd do that for Bug?
it's not just for Bug, and, uh, you're wrong about one thing.
he doesn't have nothing.
he has you.
what are you doing? - Sorry, I...
I have a boyfriend.
no, I know. - Bug and I are together.
that was the whole point of all of this.
no, I mean, I have a girlfriend, I know.
you know what?
let's just get out of here.
you can drive. I- I don't care.
I just want to go home.
you live above a bar?
of course you do.
not classy enough for you?
today's show-and day drinking has opened my eyes to your unique appeal.
talking out of my butt and drinking like a fish?
exactly.
you are so wrong.
you drive a truck, listen to Starship.
how long was your longest relationship?
hmm, three weeks, maybe four.
I bet you have a roommate.
two.
Jamie, it's the beer guy!
I'm busy.
you okay?
what?
Yeah, no, sorry.
Oh, my God.
wait.
wait. Cate, come on.
let me explain.
explain? I mean, I just walked in on you on top of my boss.
Oh, God, that image, I- I just...
I feel assaulted.
you essentially just raped my eyes.
would you just relax? It's not like it meant anything.
Oh, that's reassuring.
Hey, why, why do you even care?
I don't.
I just...
I think that sex is supposed to mean something, you know, ideally, and so if you're doing it with Trina, it obviously doesn't.
you said it yourself: when you and I had sex, it meant nothing.
when you and I did it, did it mean something or not?
look.
I'm with Ryan, okay?
I am in love with Ryan, and...
I just came here to ask you to back off.
right, because something did.
God, Cate, if you're that stressed out, grow a pair and tell him the truth.
why, because you, you're such an honest, stand-up guy?
you always go around telling people the truth?
I'm not the one with a fiance that I am lying to every day.
Ryan wants less of you in our lives.
that's what I came here to say.
so do I.
what the hell?
you take my bike like a little bitch, - and now you're up on my girl? - Bug, no.
dude, relax. - Don't tell me to relax, bro.
bug, leave it. He's giving you your bike back.
Yeah, you need to chill.
you take one more step and I will kick your face in.
this is a freaking joke. You're getting me to take this plea "for us,
to give my bike to Abercrombie here "for us"?
it was for us.
you want to be with this guy, just say it.
I don't.
stop lying. What happened with you?
nothing!
where were you? Nowhere.
we just drove around.
yeah? Were you as easy with him as you were with me?
you know what, dude? That is enough.
stop!
I can't believe you.
what, you think he likes you? He's using you.
he's not going to love you like I do.
no one is.
you okay? - Yeah, I'm good.
Lux, get in the house.
you, get off my property, or I will call the cops.
Hey, so I, uh, I gave Jones a ride home.
he's going to be all right.
Thanks.
does he act like that a lot- Bug?
sometimes.
he's not really good with people not wanting him.
go figure.
imagine what he would have done if I told him that Jones tried to kiss me.
wait. What?
I- I pushed him away.
it's nothing. It's stupid.
I don't really want to talk about it.
you don't have to feel bad for having feelings for more than one person.
I don't.
it's not like you, with Ryan and Baze.
um, well, there is no me and Baze.
no, I-I know you're with Ryan, and he's who you want to be with, but...
I don't know...
you and Baze are you and Baze.
okay, look, um, what Bug said to you
I know that must have hurt.
you are not any more damaged than anyone else.
I know you.
you may have been through more, sure, but we are all damaged:
me, you, Bug.
I mean, if I wasn't, how could I have slept with Baze behind Ryan's back?
why did you?
cause when I'm around Baze, it's like I'm still in high school.
I still feel like the girl in the head gear, you know, dating her dictionary, wanting him to notice me.
you know, it's like he taps into this screwed-up part of me that wants him to...
I don't know, um...
think I'm good enough.
it's pretty messed up, huh?
do you have feelings for him, for Baze?
do I have feelings for Baze? Yeah.
Yeah, I have angry feelings.
rejected feelings.
you know, deep down I'm sure that I have good feelings.
but what I feel for Baze, it's nothing like I feel for Ryan.
and it's definitely not love.
and the way that Bug was to you down there, the way that he spoke to you...
you know, that's not love, either.
if I tell him the truth...
if I tell him where I was today or about Jones...
he's gonna be so mad.
he already is.
you have to tell him that you deserve better, Lux.
what if he leaves me?
so what, you can lie to Bug about where you were and what happened with Jones and how you feel about the way that he's treating you you know, just to hold onto him?
but then your whole relationship - it's not real.
it's not honest.
if I tell him the truth...
I could lose him.
what if I lose him?
maybe that's a risk you have to take.
Lux, hey.
Hey.
Hey. Hi.
I wanted to talk to you.
you, uh... wanna come in?
I'm okay.
this won't take long.
when you asked me where I was today,
I was with Jones.
I was showing him where you grew up so that he would understand.
and when you asked me if anything had happened between us...
I lied.
about Baze.
I was just scared to tell you.
um... something did happen.
you know, that night that...that Lux took off...
we drove around looking for her.
I mean, it was after the hearing and we tried to call Social Services,
we just really didn't know where to go or what to do so...
we ended up back at Baze's bar.
you know, and we started talking about high school and the winter formal and... you know, how we got together in the first place.
just say it, Cate.
he kissed me.
Baze did.
what else?
just say it, Cate. What else happened?
did you sleep with him?
just don't even tell me you slept with him.
I did not sleep with him.
of course I didn't sleep with him.
he kissed me.
I pushed him away. That's all.
I swear, I told him to stop.
that I had a boyfriend and to take me home.
and I wanted to tell you.
I would have.
but when we pulled up, you were already so mad.
I never meant to lie to you.
I mean, I wasn't even thinking about it as lying.
I just... I really didn't want to make a big deal about something that meant nothing.
you know, but if I'd just told you right when it happened...
I mean, what if I just told you right when it happened?
I would have tried to understand.
I'm trying to undersnd now.
I mean, that's what you do when you love someone.
and I do.
I love you.
even if Baze tries to kiss you, I love you.
I just...
I just wish you would have told me the truth.
so, us...
what do we do?
well, first, I'm gonna punch that guy's lights out.
and then, um...
I don't know.
we get married, maybe?
I don't deserve a guy like you.
you want better, go find better.
no one's stopping you.
what?
what am I supposed to say?
I don't know! Anything!
I'm sorry," maybe?
I don't get this side of you.
it's like you turn into your...
don't say it.
it's true.
you become your dad.
you should go be with Abercrombie.
that's not what I'm saying.
no, you're right. You deserve better.
I don't want to be my dad.
I never wanna be that guy with you.
no, Bug, that's not...
you need to go.
you shouldn't be with me.
go.
should I be worried that not a single person is looking at me in the eye?
think positive.
I'm fired, for sure. - That's the spirit.
I would say that you make me sick except I wanna kiss both of you right now.
great news: Yesterday's show went over huge!
even corporate was impressed.
Trina almost smiled. - I don't believe it.
after hearing you and Baze, our listeners, they feel like they know you better and they wanna root for you, especially after hearing how big a sad-sack you were in high school.
I guess we have Baze to thank.
uh, I don't think so.
and it's awkward.
Oh, you're on in ten.
nine, eight...
Hey, everybody, it's Hump Day.
it's bright and early on a Wednesday morning. June 26.
now, hold on there. It's not summer yet.
no, June 26.
it's a Saturday.
it's also Flag Day in Romania.
and it's the day that Ryan took me to his favorite Italian restaurant.
after watching me annihilate four cannolis, he still wanted to make out.
and it's the date that Ryan and I will be getting married.
unless you have any objections.
I like June 26.
some of you might remember a little rant I went on a couple of days ago about how being married is like being stuck in a box.
the thing is, being stuck, it isn't so bad if you've got the right guy to stick it out with you.
Hey, rounding up some dudes for some late-night poker.
or are you gonna be at Cate's?
actually, I'm gonna lay off hanging at Cate's for a while.
all right.
you're in.
so. June 26. I'm thinking big not huge but appropriately over the top of it.
I would love a huge smile on your face
maybe. You know maybe even a tear or two when you see me walking down the aisle
Hey, are you okay?
why wouldn't I be?
I was just worried, you and Bug...
I said I'm fine, Jones.
it's just I got you this necklace.
Hey, Gavin.
you okay? What's wrong?
what happened?
bug left.
Gavin said he's gone.
I did what you said. I told him the truth, and he left.
I mean, what should I have done?
lied so he'd stay?
you did the right thing.
you did.
did you actually read any of his book?
Ezra knew who I was before we met.
he knew who all of us were.
do you always carry that much cash around?
who is the money for? - The money is for Ali.
she's alive.
how did it go?
that cop, Holbrook, spoke up for my dad.
I was surprised to hear that you spoke up for Mr. Hobbs. Thank you.
okay, stop.
what are you up to?
your mother and I spoke with Dr. Griggs this morning.
he recommended a rehab facility in Philly.
Ezra is moving forward with the book.
he is meeting with his agent in New York right now discussing a release date.
now I know that everything he says or has ever said is a lie.
are you going somewhere? - That's the plan.
I got to get out of here.
it's a simple question, okay.
did you or did you not see me standing with a shovel that night?
and if you did see me hurt Ali, then why didn't you just call the cops?
Hey. - Hi.
anything for the dry cleaners?
it was 3 days in rehab, Mom.
I really did not need so many sweaters.
I thought, I don't know, maybe you'd go outside for some fresh air or if you got cold.
I did get cold and then I got the sweats.
you know, withdrawal symptoms can't really be stopped with a cable knit.
they said that the medical detox would help mitigate your discomfort.
it did, mom. I was so comfortable kicking my drug habit.
sorry.
I'm very irritable.
they said to expect irritability over the next few days.
as long as you're home and well, I can handle it.
don't you walk away from me.
is there anything you need?
there's left-over carbonara or I can make a salad if you'd like something lighter.
you're way out of your league, Spencer.
you sure about that?
put that thing down before you hurt yourself.
I said you look tired.
maybe you should get some rest.
we have some things to discuss in the morning.
mom? Have you seen my car keys?
I want to get to school early and catch up on any assignments that I might have missed.
Oh, I'm so sorry to interrupt.
honey, this is Dean Stavros.
he's going to be staying with us for a while.
Hi.
sweetheart, you're not going back to school just yet.
we've already taken your car keys.
I'll need your cellphone and your laptop as well.
but why?
there will be no phone calls of any kind, no internet, no friends.
we'll be sure to get your assignments from school.
and how do you expect me to turn them in? Carrier pigeon?
you'll earn your privileges back over time, as long as you follow Dean's program.
the doctor said that I was fine to go back to school, as long as I agreed to outpatient counseling.
could you please excuse us? I need to talk to my mom.
actually, I don't think I can.
Spencer, I'm a drug and alcohol abuse counselor.
your parents brought me here to help you.
I'm gonna be camped out in the barn, on-call 24/7...
so you're basically a baby-sitter.
do you and Dad distrust me this much?
quite frankly, given this latest episode, yes.
I understand you may be feeling a little ambushed.
excuse me. How long am I supposed to stay under guard?
I have to apologize for my daughter.
Oh, as long as you're handing them out, I would love an apology from you.
your father and I thought the first time would be the last.
since you've relapsed... - I would hardly call this a relapse.
Spencer, look, I bet your mom would be a whole lot more open to hearing you out if you hand over your electronics.
show her you're willing to cooperate.
can I please just call Toby?
I tried him last night and he hasn't called me back yet.
I've had a conversation with Toby and he understands that you'll be hard to reach for the time being.
it will give us all a chance to focus.
great.
where do we start?
fantastic.
I will go upstairs and fill this with my dignity.
I'm still at Syracuse.
does your dad know what happened?
no. No. He thinks I'm here for a Prospective Student Week.
it's 4 days of campus tours, classroom visits, and a bunch of father-daughter bonding time.
how are you doing? Really.
um, honestly, I'm just trying not to think about any of it.
him. Everything.
you don't have to go through this on your own.
you know, we can all come up there.
no, it's okay. I'm not alone.
I just mean that my dad's here with me.
look, I've got to go. The tour's starting. Bye.
morning, sunshine.
no, don't start. You look worse than me.
no. I don't.
you ready to learn about the history of this illustrious institution?
I'm ready for some sleep or coffee.
I don't know, an aspirin.
Yeah, my student host didn't exactly offer continental breakfast.
okay, everyone, over here for the tour please.
we...we really need to go on this thing?
I know a place nearby. Killer pancakes.
you mean bail on the tour?
only if you want.
I want. - All right.
come on. Give those back. I need them.
this way, over here.
aria finally called me this morning.
is she still mad at me?
she's not mad, she's hurting.
but she sounded okay.
distant. Are we still going to Spencer's later?
it was so weird. I called her cell and her mom answered.
there's no visitors and she's not gonna be in school for a while.
probably for the best.
I saw Fitz's car in the teacher's parking lot.
wait, he's back?
so he just goes to New York to collect the big, fat check for selling us out.
and then what, comes back here to gloat?
I wish you would have told me this before I bought tickets.
do you want to go at all?
I'm sorry, Mike. I don't know what to say.
give me a call when you figure it out.
looks like he's still pulling Mona's strings.
do you think Fitz was behind whatever that was?
I mean, Mike and Mona didn't really make much sense unless...
unless she was spying on Aria for him.
now I'm mad. We should say something.
are you coming? - I can't.
if you're gonna slash his tires or bust his headlights, I'd still be down.
but I don't want to be in the same room with him.
I know. I get it.
Hey, I'm gonna ditch last period. Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Emily, class doesn't start for another few minutes.
okay, I don't know how much you know but as close as you are to Aria,
I can assume that you know everything.
I really want to talk to about this, Emily, but I would really prefer if it were outside of a classroom.
I don't think that's going to happen.
I've already talked to you outside of the classroom.
I let you help me with my college essays.
you tutored me.
you helped me when I lost my girlfriend.
why did you do all of that?
what did you get out of it?
there's an assignment due today, but I won't be staying for the class.
will you make sure a real teacher gets this?
don't get up. I don't want to accidentally run into your mouth again.
is that what that was?
look, it wasn't supposed to happen.
and it's not going to ever again. I promise.
I'm sure Travis will be glad to hear that.
after court, when I passed the two of you talking,
it seemed like there was a look.
do you have a minute to sit?
you know, I actually just came to apologize.
I just...I thought it would be weird if I saw you and I didn't say anything.
is there anything else you want to talk about?
no. I'm good.
well, there's a couple of things I'd like to ask you.
please sit.
what do you know about this?
attention: officer Holbrook
I've never seen this before.
you recognize the handwriting?
why don't you open it up, read the note inside?
it might look familiar.
I know for a fact Alison Dilaurentis is alive. Start looking for her.
A.D. Incorporatcd P.C.Box 537 Wallingford, PA
what is this?
I was hoping you could tell me.
I didn't write it, if that's what you're asking.
I thought it was a possibility.
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask.
well, you don't think that's real, do you?
I mean you're not going to go looking for Alison now, are you?
no, don't worry. We get stuff like that all the time.
it's probably just another crackpot.
I have to go meet my mom for dinner.
it's a little early for that, don't you think?
it's my turn to cook.
that's good.
no, keep playing.
no, I just...I just wanted to give Antonio a little air.
Oh, you named your guitar Antonio?
I like to think Antonio named himself.
you slept well?
um, yeah, a little bit.
I still feel like my head's a bowling ball, but I don't think I'm gonna yak on my shoes anymore.
Hey, that's progress.
you don't normally drink, do you?
this week's anything but normal.
why is that?
Oh, we missed the last tour, huh?
we can learn about the Hall of Languages and the billion dollar endowment another day.
so your dad...
I thought you were staying with your dad.
I am. Yeah, he's...he's just right next door.
so what does he profess?
art history.
you into art, too? - A little.
um, I like to write, but who knows now.
what...what are you looking for?
hair of the dog.
that's supposed to cure hangover, right?
God, we totally raided this thing.
who drank the pineapple rum? - Guilty.
how much do you think all this stuff cost?
no, not too much a lot. Maybe a couple of hundred dollars.
I'm serious. - Me, too.
just tell your dad you had the drunkies.
and invited a boy over. - Yeah.
mm, I think that will go over real well.
I know you dug her grave. Now I'm digging yours. Kiss. - A
look, somebody else knows Alison's alive and they just told the cops.
does Holbrook know who it's from?
did he say if it was from a guy or a girl?
it's anonymous. And they're still trying to figure it out.
I'll be right back.
what's up? Your text said I should come find you.
Yeah, my mom wanted to invite you and your family over for dinner just to say thanks for everything.
that's really nice of her, but she doesn't have to go through that.
trust me, you don't want to miss it.
she doesn't really cook often, but when she does it's pretty amazing.
okay.
you know, I was thinking maybe you and I could do a meal sometime.
just the two of us. - Sure.
wait, is that like a date?
I actually hope it will be.
how about tomorrow night?
Yeah, okay. - Okay.
did he just ask you out?
okay, I'm not digging the timing, but...
are you even ready for that? - No, I'm ready.
I just hope nothing else crazy happens between now and then.
drinking a glass of salad is supposed to give me my life back?
your body needs the nutrition.
you'll feel stronger, you'll think clearer, you'll sleep better.
I sleep just fine.
I heard you doing laundry at 2: 00 in the morning.
my sheets were dirty.
what, do you want to analyze those, too?
I just thought it was unusual.
you know, with ADHD meds people tend to sleep a lot during withdrawal.
and you're definitely irritable.
any flu-like symptoms?
not anymore.
what about nightmares?
um, what about hallucinations?
maybe.
they're nothing to worry about.
it's just your mind and body getting reacquainted.
take drugs away and things come up.
what kind of things?
things you've forgotten.
things you've suppressed. Things you need to deal with.
when I was first in recovery, a healthy diet and exercise really worked for me.
I mean, it took the edge off. It's worth a try.
ever do yoga? - No, not usually.
I don't really excel at athletics unless there's somebody to beat.
I'd like to avoid competition.
I think that drive may have triggered your abuse in the first place.
but kicking your ass at tennis might be very therapeutic.
Yeah, I get the feeling you'd like to kick my ass, period.
but I'm in the barn until your parents and doctor say otherwise.
so get motivated. We've got a lot to cover today.
I'm just gonna take a quick shower.
Toby, hey, please I really, really need to talk to you.
I'm starting to worry because I haven't heard from you.
I just need you to tell me that I'm not, like, a horrible person.
how come I don't hear any running water?
I know what you did. And I am not amused.
since when is getting a skinny latte a crime?
we're not here to joke around, Hanna.
Gabe, what is she talking about?
it won't be hard for me to match your handwriting to the note.
when I do, I'll have to bring you down for questioning.
Hanna, if there's anything else you have to say about the note, now is the time.
she's not going to find anything.
I swear, I didn't write it.
good cop, bad cop, " I thought that would do the job, but she's one tough little cookie.
I kind of like her.
we arrested her mother and we were wrong.
and we put that family through hell.
my gut tells me that she's trying to do the same thing.
she's giving us the runaround.
I know this girl. Something doesn't jive.
I think that note's legit.
you're on your own with that theory.
but keep an eye on her.
let's see if she takes this to one of her friends.
maybe they're all in on it.
is that your dad? - Yep.
he wants to take me into some restaurant tonight, a little quality father-daughter time.
Jeremiah's?
Yeah. How did you know that?
that's the only good vegetarian place around here.
how do you know so much about SU?
I thought that you were from Cedar Rapids.
I am. But my parents went to school here.
they met on campus in chem lab, freshman year.
I have three older sisters and they all graduated from Syracuse, too.
let me guess.
you don't want to continue the tradition?
I got into Berklee College of Music.
that's amazing.
Yeah, well, my parents don't think music is the kind of thing you study.
what about you?
I...I love music.
you know what I mean.
you clearly didn't come here to look at a college.
um, some jerk just broke my heart into, like, 30, 000 million pieces.
that's a lot.
tell me about it.
anyway, so, yeah, he's back home and that's why I'm here.
just needed to disappear for a little bit, I guess.
that doesn't seem right.
he's the jerk, but you're the one in exile?
shouldn't it be the other way around?
not that I'm complaining or anything.
Yeah, you better not be.
I can finish this. Why don't you go up and put your laundry away?
okay.
Thanks.
I'll get it.
Spencer. Veronica, may I come in?
I was just stopping by to see if you got the flyer I left in your mailbox about the bridal show fund-raiser.
I did. - I didn't get your RSVP.
I'll have to check the calendar. I'll be right back.
you're looking well.
your mother told me that you had a bug.
your outburst at my home was a reaction to some over-the-counter medication?
Yeah, yeah.
next time I'll be sure to buy name brand.
I'm so sorry for everything that I said and for the way that I grabbed you.
I really was not myself.
no apology necessary.
my guess is she's in there writing a check.
I wouldn't expect her to attend.
but it's all for a good cause.
you know, the charity feeds starving children.
no mother should have to watch her child die.
um, I should probably just take my laundry up and go to bed.
nothing beats a good night's sleep on a set of fresh, clean sheets.
I'm sorry, Jessica.
we have another commitment that night.
I hope this helps. - Thank you.
I so appreciate your generosity.
goodbye, Spencer.
well, you sure do look nice.
you ready for our last big day?
I actually just came by to let you know I'm gonna cut out early.
head back home.
maybe take Antonio on the scenic route.
you're gonna go talk to your folks about Berklee?
that's the plan.
look, I just wanted to say,
I thought this was gonna be a pretty unbearable week and it ended up being pretty great.
so thank you.
you should find me if you're ever in Rosewood.
count on it.
Bye.
thank you.
have you talked to Aria?
not today. Why?
she's not answering any of my calls or texts.
look, if you hear from her, tell her I said, "thanks.
Mike, hold on.
can you take over for a sec? Thanks.
what's going on? - Aria got what she wanted.
Mona dumped me this morning.
I got a text really early that said we're done. Just like that.
okay, I'm sorry that happened but I don't think Aria was involved.
Oh, so the fact that you guys can't stand her has nothing to do with it?
I can't think of another reason why Mona would just cut me off like a wart.
maybe I could talk to her. Find out what's going on.
whatever.
just tell Aria to call me.
beat up a jerk card
Hey, we just did 3 loops, that's 3 miles.
and now we're doing an extra loop for your little phone stunt yesterday.
God, why are you so mean, Dean?
because you make me tense, Spence.
I mean how long are you gonna keep this up?
Rhyming? I could go all day.
look.
I can see that you're a smart girl with a sharp tongue, and you love to spar.
but getting under my skin isn't the goal here.
it's getting under yours so we can address what's really going on.
do you have any interest in that?
one more mile. Let's go.
damn it, Ali, I said stop it.
Hey, hey, take a deep breath.
now tell me what's going on.
I think I know what I did.
do you ever ...
think that sometimes people see you more clearly than you see yourself?
I'm not sure what you mean.
there are things that happened that I don't remember and other people do.
and you're using their memories to fill in the blanks?
Yeah. What else can I do?
well, maybe recalling what really happened is a little too much to wrap your head around right now.
I mean I should have known that I was capable of something like this.
I've done bad things before.
wait. Look, before you go to that place,
I want you to look at what happened today as a positive.
it sounds like to me, at least emotionally, you're ready to take responsibility for your actions.
you want to know what you did, maybe make good on a few things.
how am I supposed to take responsibility?
I mean if I...if I really did this.
did what, Spencer?
nothing.
nothing. I'm sorry. I'm really talked-out right now.
I think we've covered enough.
I'm gonna give you some space so you can read that.
just so you know, I'm a picker.
so whatever I order, the other person's plate always looks better.
what does that even mean?
it means whatever you order, get a side of garlic bread.
Hanna? - Hi, Mrs. D.
don't you look lovely tonight?
are we on a date?
Yeah. Yeah. This is Travis.
nice to meet you.
such a gentleman.
I won't keep you. You two enjoy yourselves.
Mrs. DiLaurentis?
lieutenant Tanner. - Detective Holbrook.
please come with us.
I'm sorry. This will just take one moment.
uh, so if you want the garlic bread, maybe I should order the lasagna.
Yeah, yeah, sounds good.
I need to talk to you. - I have somewhere to be.
going to meet with Ezra Fitz?
get in.
Aria. - Can I come in?
why would you help him?
I'm surprised it took you this long to figure it out.
and I kind of expected it would be Aria.
he should have told her about the book a long time ago.
when did you find out?
around the time I bought Jenna's car.
but I didn't want to help him with his tattle-tale, I wanted to stop him.
or at least, stop the parts that included me, some of the stuff I did, I could still go to jail for.
so we made a deal.
I would answer questions about my exploits, and he'd edit out anything I did that was less than legal.
did you read the book?
do you know what it says about Alison?
if Alison were alive, I'm sure she'd love being the focus of a scandalous page-turner.
but no, Ezra only showed me parts of chapters I was written into.
I never saw the whole thing.
I didn't come here to hash things out.
I came here to tell you that you need to leave.
Yeah, I understand you need your space.
no, I don't think that you understand.
I do. I spoke with Hackett yesterday and I'm taking a leave of absence.
no, Ezra.
you need to leave town. For good.
Aria, we can work through this. - I don't want to work through this.
I don't want to run into you at the grocery or every time I grab coffee with my friends I don't want to see you.
I don't want to hear from you. Ever.
so you dated Mike to get closer to Aria, so you could spy on her.
Mike's a really sweet guy. I fell for him.
when you guys started to catch on, I tried to tell Fitz I wanted out.
he said that wasn't an option.
I didn't want to drag Mike into my mess, so I let him go.
you went through all that and got nothing?
not nothing.
it's murky, but it's big.
remember, after the lodge burned down,
I told you all that someone stole the game from me when I was in Radley?
we all thought it was CeCe. - I never found out.
but whoever it is, Ezra thinks he knows.
this is a copy of my manuscript.
Thanks, but I think I'll wait till it's in the clearance bin.
I really think you should read it.
I found some stuff out that can really help you.
and for what it's worth, I was in New York returning my publisher's advance.
I thought if I pulled the plug... - It's too late, Ezra.
well, I guess this is good-bye then.
I'm about to kill this dessert. You'd better jump in if you want a bite.
Oh, no, you can finish it.
something wrong?
look, Travis, I'm so sorry. I've got to go.
can I please just pay for my half?
I don't go Dutch on the first date.
you sure everything's okay? Do you want me to drop you somewhere?
no, it's just a friend.
I knew something was up.
you've been distracted almost the whole night.
and it's not just since that text came in.
I'm just a little rusty.
it's been a while since I've been on a date.
come on, this wasn't a date. Your phone makes a lousy third wheel.
look, it won't happen again, I promise.
I just...I really have to go.
Thanks.
look, I know it didn't seem like it, but I had a really great time.
so you think that Mona left that anonymous tip?
well, if she was upset that she had to dump Mike, maybe she was trying to make Fitz pay.
it could all lead back to Ezra.
it might stop him from publishing while they investigate.
em, how long has this been there?
what...what are you talking about?
the blue envelope.
it's a note from Paige. Why?
sorry. I had to finish reading it to be sure, but...
Ezra gave me a copy of his book. - You talked to him?
Mona dumped your brother, and he thinks you made her do it, but really it was because of Ezra.
sorry. Housekeeping.
Yeah, I'll deal with that.
you're back. Are you better?
better, yeah, but it's your SOS, so why don't you go first?
okay, there is something that Ezra wanted us to know.
I thought you went to Syracuse to get away from him? What changed?
I...I just figured out how to say what needed to be said.
and then he gave me a copy of his book.
you guys, you're never going to believe this, but Ezra thinks that "A" is Ali's mom.
are you sure that's what it says? That Mrs. DiLaurentis is "A"?
that's ridiculous. How old is she? Does she even know how to text?
a" has been telling us to stop going after Alison probably because "A" wants to bring her home.
but that's exactly what we've been trying to do.
why would Mrs. DiLaurentis think that we were in the way?
maybe because she thinks I tried to kill Ali.
when did Ali's mom accuse you of attempted murder?
and why are you just now telling us this?
look, the other night I found a bunch of dirt in the bottom of my bed and Ali's mom made some cryptic comment about it.
don't pin that on her. I mean that sounds like an "A" move.
which is why I think she's "A.
Mrs. D being "A" makes about as much sense as you whacking Ali over the head with a shovel.
I could have.
Cece told Ezra that both she and Mrs. DiLaurentis saw me pick up a shovel and go after Ali.
but Alison is still alive.
we argued that night, okay.
and we'd all been drinking but I was also on amphetamines.
I don't remember anything and lately I've been seeing things.
I don't know if it's just me coming off of the drugs or if it is a guilty conscience.
but if two people saw me... - Why believe anything CeCe says?
because it wasn't just CeCe. Ezra put it in his book, okay.
he thinks that one of us tried to kill her and that person is probably me.
the only person that knows what really happened is Alison.
Yeah, and she's not here to help us, is she?
I can't talk about this anymore. I'm gonna get a snack.
somebody want anything?
Yeah, sure. - I'm not hungry.
I'll come with you.
Hey, Em, can I ask you something?
we don't have any cheesy puffs.
my mom says the orange powder has chemicals in it that make you break out.
no, it's...look, it's important and I need you to tell me the truth.
you told Paige that Alison's alive, didn't you?
dad put some leftovers in the fridge for you.
I ate 'em.
it's fine, I had something at Emily's.
I heard about Mona.
Mike, I'm really sorry.
I know how much it hurts.
you know that I would never... - I know.
it was just easier to blame you than admit you were right all along.
maybe about this.
but there are plenty of other things that I'm wrong about.
are we going to have to lock you in your room at night?
mom, I'm sorry. It was really, really important.
more important than staying sober? - No.
were you out looking for drugs? - What? Mom, no.
the drawer was open. Did you...give me your phone.
what does "SOS" mean? And why were you meeting up at Emily's?
hanging out with your friends, that's what was so important?
I'm about ready to throw my hands up.
you keep flirting with disaster no matter how hard we try to protect you.
maybe you should stop.
it's about a quarter past sarcasm, Spencer.
you want to try another tone? - I'm not being sarcastic.
you and Dad said that you covered for me that summer when I was first using.
what did you mean? Because I still don't remember.
consider it a blessing.
I'm going to bed. I suggest you do the same.
are you okay?
come to Los Angeles.
the sun shines bright.
the beaches are wide and inviting.
and the orange groves stretch as far as the eye can see.
there are jobs aplenty.
land is cheap.
every workingman can have his own house.
and inside every house, a happy all-American family.
you can have all this.
and who knows?
you could even be discovered become a movie star, or at least see one.
life is good in Los Angeles.
it's paradise on earth.
that's what they tell you, anyway.
because they're selling an image.
they're selling it through movies, radio and television.
in the hit show, Badge of Honor, the L. A. cops walk on water as they keep the city clean of crooks.
you'd think this place was the Garden of Eden.
but there's trouble in paradise and his name is Meyer Harris Cohen,
Mickey C, to his fans.
local L. A. color to the nth degree.
and his number one bodyguard
Johnny Stompanato.
Mickey C's the head of organized crime in these parts.
he runs dope, rackets and prostitution.
he kills a dozen people a year.
and the dapper little gent does it in style.
and every time his picture's on the front page it's a black eye for the image of Los Angeles.
because how can organized crime exist in the city with the best police force in the world?
something has to be done.
but nothing too original, because, hey, this is Hollywood.
what worked for Al Capone would work for the Mickster.
Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.
nonpayment of federal income tax.
but all is not well.
sending Mickey up has created a vacuum.
and it's only a matter of time before someone with balls of brass tries to fill it.
remember, dear readers you heard it here first off the record on the q. t and very Hush-Hush.
you're like Santa Claus with that list.
except everyone on it's been naughty.
guy's been out of Q two weeks.
leave it for later.
we've got to pick up the booze and get it to the station.
Hollywood, this is 6-Adam-7.
have Central send a prowler to 4216 Evergreen.
parole violation: assault arising from a family dispute.
we won't be here. They'll see him.
quit whining!
quit whining all the time! It makes me sick!
shut up!
who the hell are you?
the ghost of Christmas past.
dance with a man for a change?
what are you, a smart ass?
I'll get cozy with your parole officer.
you touch her again,
I'll have you violated on a kiddies rapper beef.
you know what they do to kiddies rappers in Quentin.
you have someplace you can go?
go get yourself fixed up.
merry Christmas.
merry Christmas, ma'am. -Let's go, Bud.
the guys will be waiting.
what do you do on Badge of Honor?
I'm the technical advisor.
I teach Brett Chase how to walk and talk like a cop.
Brett Chase doesn't walk and talk like you.
that's because he's the television version.
america isn't ready for the real me.
is it true you're the one who arrested Bob Mitchum?
badge of Honor guys pretend.
but being the real thing must be a thrill.
why don't we go someplace quiet?
I'll give you the lowdown on Mitchum.
big V. Jack Vincennes.
may I have this dance? -Of course.
this is Sid Hudgens with Hush-Hush magazine.
Hello, Karen.
hello yourself.
what's that about?
we did a piece,Ingenue Dikes in Hollywood.
her name got mentioned.
Jackie-boy a friend just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.
he's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan.
sorry, I lost you for a second, Sid.
contract players, Metro.
you pinch them, I do a nice feature next issue.
plus the usual $50 cash.
no, I need another $50.
two $20's for two patrolmen, a dime for the Hollywood Station watch commander.
Jackie, it's Christmas.
no, it's not. It's felony possession of marijuana.
actually, it's circulation 36, 000 and climbing.
there's no telling where this will go.
radio, television.
once you whet the public's appetite for the truth, the sky's the limit.
sergeant Ed Exley, son of the legendary Preston Exley.
must be a hard act to follow.
why not make a mark somewhere else?
why become a cop, Ed?
I like to help people.
we heard 2 officers were assaulted this evening.
what do you think about that?
goes with the job.
I took the report.
luckily, they're okay.
aren't you young to be watch commander?
it's only tonight.
the married men have Christmas Eve off.
that's a good lead for the story.
merry Christmas, Captain.
captain Smith. -Drop the formalities, Bobby.
it's Christmas
Eve, call me Dudley.
I came up with a title for the story.
I'm calling it "Silent Night with the LAPD " .
that's grand.
now remember, Bobby, that's "Smith " .
with an "S.
thank you, gentlemen.
merry Christmas.
hold on there, lads.
merry Christmas.
I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.
first out of 23.
what'll it be, then?
patrol Division? Internal Affairs? What?
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Edmund you're a political animal.
you have the eye for human weakness, but not the stomach.
you're wrong, sir.
would you be willing to plant evidence on a suspect you knew to be guilty in order to insure an indictment?
we've been over this.
yes or no?
no.
would you beat a confession out of a suspect you knew to be guilty?
no.
would you shoot a hardened criminal in the back in order to offset the chance that some lawyer
no.
then for the love of God don't be a detective.
work where you don't have to make those kind of choices.
dudley, I know you mean well but I don't need to do it the way you did or my father.
at least get rid of the glasses.
I can't think of a man on the Bureau who wears them.
if I get held up, you guys better be here.
Hi, Nick.
I need a delivery.
a case each of gin, rum, Scotch.
sounds like a hell of a party.
be right with you.
merry Christmas.
merry Christmas to you, officer.
that obvious?
it's practically stamped on your forehead.
there you go.
see what he wants, Buzz.
get lost, why don't you?
down! Get your fucking head down.
I got a license for that.
cut me some slack. I used to be a cop.
Leland Meeks. Never heard of you.
they call me Buzz.
I don't give a rat's ass what they call you.
keep your head down.
and stay there,Buzz.
you okay?
she's fine.
I'm not asking you, sir.
somebody hit you?
it's not what you think.
what is it, then?
you got the wrong idea, mister. I'm fine.
but it's nice to know you care.
drive safely.
what's going on?
you know him?
Yeah, I've seen him around.
he used to be a cop.
they're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
put your camera right there.
when I walk out, I'll stop here.
get the movie premiere in the background.
I like it.
the Movie Premiere Pot Bust.
when I walk out, I don't want your floodlights in my eyes.
consider it done. You hear that, Chip?
come on.
go! Pop them!
Freeze! Police!
come on. Come on, let's go.
my family's coming in
it'll be a nice Christmas gift.
Hi, Tammy.
Hi, Matt.
right over here.
just turn. -Hold it. Got it!
the Movie Premiere Pot Bust!
take them in.
I'll get the evidence.
it's Christmas Eve in the City of Angels and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous hopheads prowl for marijuana not knowing that a man is coming to stop them:
celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes.
scourge of grasshoppers and dope fiends everywhere.
you like it?
Yeah, subtle.
what took you?
my partner stopped to help a damsel in distress.
his priorities are all screwed up.
up to your old tricks again, Bud?
Hollywood Jack, what brings you to our humble station house?
how are you? -Why are you here?
you know me. Keeping the streets safe.
take these two, get them dressed and book them.
the party's upstairs.
okay, I'll be right up.
what's that for?
you are watch commander tonight, aren't you?
Yeah. So?
a gratuity from Hush-Hush magazine.
buy yourself some new loafers.
no thanks, Jack. You keep your payoff.
I'm not interested.
what the hell is this?
six spics. Mexicans, sir. The ones who assaulted Brown and Helenowski.
I heard Helenowski bled 6 pints and Brown's in a coma.
they have bruises and muscle pulls.
it's not what I heard.
get them into lock up.
Stens, you guys hear what those taco benders did to Helenowski and Brown?
Helenowski lost an eye, and they're reading Brown his last rites.
that ought to make for a very merry Christmas for them.
Hey, guys.
guys. They brought the Mexicans in.
they're downstairs.
let's do it.
come on, guys. Let's get them.
Stensland, the party's upstairs.
this doesn't concern you.
come on, guys. Haven't you got work?
go back to the party.
come on, it's Christmas, help me out.
move it!
I just got a few more questions.
you don't have to be here.
go!
you better put a leash on your partner before he kills somebody.
teach him a lesson!
get him, Stens!
this is for ours, Poncho.
get him, Stens!
let me through!
No! He didn't do nothing!
what are you looking at?
tell that Mexican to shut up!
you're sick!
don't break it up. Get back! Get back!
Yeah, and fuck your mother!
fuck you!
stop, officer! That's an order!
you'll all be in my report!
bloody Christmas.
the press love to label.
you should know this is bigger than the police board.
the grand jury's convening.
indictments may be handed down.
will you testify?
no, sir. I won't.
district Attorney Loew?
you and officer Stensland brought the liquor to the station.
Stensland was already drunk.
appearing as a voluntary witness against him could offset damage to yourself.
I won't testify against him, or anyone else.
this man is a disgrace.
your badge and gun, officer.
you're suspended from duty.
dismissed.
we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the Department.
justice has to be served.
of course I'll testify.
I'm glad you feel that way, Edmund.
most don't.
they think silence and integrity are the same thing.
not exactly the image of the new LAPD we're trying to create.
welcome to Los Angeles, the city of the future.
may I make a suggestion, sir?
by all means.
the public will expect the Department to sweep this under the carpet.
don't.
shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.
force them to retire.
but somebody has to swing.
so indict, try and convict Richard Stensland and Bud White.
secure them jail time.
the message will be clear.
this Department will not tolerate officers who think they're above the law.
Dick Stensland is an embarrassment as a policeman.
he's had rotten fitness reports from every C. O. he's served under.
but Bud White is a valuable officer.
white's a mindless thug.
no, Edmund but he can answer "yes" to those questions I've asked you before.
the Department and the public need role models.
clean-cut, forthright men the public can admire.
Sergeant,I'll promote you to lieutenant effective immediately.
detective Lieutenant.
ed, you're 30.
your father didn't make lieutenant till he was 33.
I know that, sir.
when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
before we start polishing our laurels it'd look better if we had a corroborative witness.
that won't be easy to come by.
the men hate a stool pigeon.
Jack Vincennes.
he hit one of the Mexicans.
a veteran like Vincennes might be willing to admit his own culpability but he'd never rat out a fellow officer.
Jack's the technical advisor on Badge of Honor.
he lives for it.
that's how to get to him.
I'd like you to observe, Ed.
call Sergeant Vincennes.
bright kid.
you may reap the benefit but are you ready to be despised in the Department?
Yes, sir, I am.
so be it.
sergeant, we'll get right to it.
nine civilian witnesses have identified you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia.
but we have a witness who will name names and testify that you hit back only after being hit.
you will testify against 3 officers who have earned their pensions and plead ignorance about the rest.
no thanks. I'm not a snitch.
I'll guarantee you a slap on the wrist, a brief suspension followed by a temporary transfer from Narcotics to Vice.
you transfer out of Vice, you'll be back on the show.
the show?
badge of Honor, Vincennes.
we need to tone down your profile for a bit.
I doubt you've ever taken a stupid breath.
don't start now.
okay, I'll do it.
the grand jury will hear your testimony tomorrow.
and so it goes Detective Lieutenant.
ace them at the grand jury tomorrow, son.
wear a smart-looking suit and ace them.
and Ed lose the glasses.
so you're the stellar witness.
I should have known.
what's the Chief throwing you?
throwing me?
Yeah, Exley, what's the payoff?
you're the payoff expert.
I'm just doing my duty.
come on, you're playing an angle here, college boy.
you'll get something so you don't have to hobnob with the cops who'll hate you for snitching.
if they're making you detective, watch out.
some Bureau guys will burn in this and you'll be working with their friends.
what about you?
I'm snitching 3 old-timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.
next to you, I'm clean and smart.
Edmund J. Exley to chambers.
and remember
bud White will fuck you for this if it takes the rest of his life.
captain, what do you want?
call me Dudley.
dudley what do you want?
look, lad,
I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.
I admire you as a policeman and your adherence to violence as a necessary adjunct to the job.
I'm impressed with your punishment of women-beaters.
do you hate them, Wendell?
what do you want?
they're yours.
take them.
there's no bill on me?
4 witnesses recanted their testimony.
Why? They had a change of heart.
Stensland?
your partner's through.
scapegoat on the Chief's orders.
a year from his pension.
Exley! -Exley got what he wanted.
as a politician he exceeds even myself.
the Department needs smart men like Exley and direct men like you.
look, I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me.
a duty few men are fit for but you were born for.
you'd be working out of Homicide at City Hall.
homicide?
working cases?
your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.
it's a muscle job.
you'll do as I say and ask no questions.
do you follow my drift?
in Technicolor, sir.
meet Tony Brancato and Anthony Trombino two rising lieutenants in the Mickey Cohen rackets.
with the dapper little gent in prison who knows how far they'll go.
the sky's the limit.
Oh, well.
meet Deuce Perkins,
Mickey Cohen's narcotics lieutenant.
could he be behind the hits?
is he consolidating organized crime power?
I suppose not.
one thing's for sure:
2-man triggers are punching the tickets on the Mickster's muscle.
meanwhile, rumor has it the LAPD has set up a not-so-Welcome Wagon to dishearten the criminal element from filling the void left by Mickey's absence.
when I know more, dear readers, so will you.
off the record, on the q. t and very Hush-Hush.
with Mickey Cohen in prison, Los Angeles is organized crime-free.
the Chief wants to keep it that way.
in Cleveland, you're an organized crime associate in desperate need of re-education in the ways of polite society.
I hear things.
like those 2-men shooter teams.
they're slaughtering Cohen's lieutenants.
what do you want?
we want you to go home.
picture-book smut, men.
there's been a bunch of this found at crime scenes lately.
quality ranges from piss-poor to very well done.
look who's back from suspension.
we're honored, Sergeant Jack.
look at that. The Great Jerk-Off Case of 1953.
is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, working Narcotics, looking for Cohen's missing H.
Yeah, finding 25 pounds of heroin would get you plenty of ink.
you should've thought of that before Bloody Christmas.
make a major case.
it's the only way you'll get out of here.
dismissed, gentlemen.
go get the facts, Jack.
just the facts.
whatever you desire.
Hi. I'd like to get a delivery to Beverly Hills.
I don't know you.
a friend just gave me this number and I wanted to find out if
would you grab a reverse directory and shag a name and address for me?
Crestview-2239.
hush-hush, off the record and on the q. t.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Jackie, you back on narco?
I need some good copy.
I have something going with Vice.
something juicy for the Sidster?
tracking porn. Arty, high-class stuff.
know about Fleur-de-Lis?
slogan's "Whatever you desire " .
no, I've heard burkes.
get me some narco skinny.
I want to do an all-hophead issue.
shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars. You like it?
I'll talk to you later.
what do you got?
the number's not assigned. Sir.
Thanks, Ginger.
a bootleg.
take it easy.
tough break, Stens.
we're going to miss you.
raw deal, Stensland.
here comes the snitch.
sorry about that, Lieutenant.
stay out of trouble, Bud.
I got a few hours.
I'll buy you a drink.
rain check. I got a hot date.
who is she and what did you arrest her for?
it's confidential.
like that magazine that Vincennes scams for.
hush-hush.
I'll see you later in the week.
we'll do the town, on me.
Yeah. I'll bring my wallet just in case.
see you tomorrow.
hold on!
I'll walk down with you.
punk kid. Who is he trying to impress?
Yeah, I wonder.
got himself a real career going.
sergeant Williams, pick up, please.
sergeant Williams?
is there anybody up there in Homicide?
anybody there?
lieutenant Exley.
you've got a homicide downtown.
the Nite Owl Coffee Shop.
I got it.
at least one person's dead.
I stopped for coffee.
no one comes through the front door. Understand?
understand?
I want barricades at both ends of the street. Make sure
I took the call. It's my case.
you don't want it and you can't have it.
I took the call.
it's mine.
I'll make you my second-in-command.
captain, over here, please.
the cook drew a gun and set it off.
the rest died in the men's room.
sir we got a total of 15 spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.
I'm betting 3 men, 5-shot capacity pumps, all of them emptying once.
excuse me, we got an I. D. on one of the victims.
it's Dick Stensland.
at first, I thought she was Rita Hayworth.
Yeah, me too.
hell of a way to avoid prison.
what happened?
appears 3 men held up a coffee shop.
the guy at the register pulled a gun, so they killed him.
then they killed everyone else.
lieutenant, we're ready with that Nite Owl I. D.
is this your daughter?
I don't know.
we know this is difficult.
take your time.
it seems like my Susan.
but my Susan was a blonde, not a redhead.
when was the last time you saw her?
just before Christmas.
we'd fought. I didn't like her boyfriend.
Mrs. Lefferts does your daughter have any distinguishing marks?
you got the wrong idea, mister. I'm fine.
she has a birthmark on her hip.
it's her. My baby!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lefferts.
who's in charge of this investigation?
captain Smith and myself. Why?
the Nite Owl Massacre.
hyperbole aside this is a heinous crime that requires swift resolution.
six victims.
one of them, one of our own. Dick Stensland.
he was a Nite Owl regular, in the wrong place at the wrong time.
robbery is the likely motive.
we have rubber glove smears on the register and forensics tend toward a trio of shooters.
we do have one hot lead.
three Negro juveniles were seen discharging shotguns in Griffith Park.
a park ranger I. D.'d them as driving a 1948-1950 Mercury coupe maroon in color.
an hour ago a canvassing crew found a news vendor who saw a maroon Merc coupe parked by the Nite Owl at 1 a. m.
DMV has come up with a registration list of Merc coupes.
two-man teams will shake three names apiece.
interrogations will be led by Lt. Edmund Exley.
enough on that!
gentlemen, just go out and get them.
use all necessary force.
the people of Los Angeles demand it.
dismissed.
why not just put a bounty on them?
ready to roll?
you take them, I got something to do.
what if one of these names--?
get somebody else.
I got our assignments, Big V.
we go by this list, we got zero chance of making this collar.
I got a guy who knows what happens south of Jefferson.
he'll put us at 50-50.
what are you doing?
it's the same sort of thing that got you in trouble before.
I'll take those odds.
we got it from here.
you two should bring along a photographer.
I need an address on a customer of yours.
her name is Lynn.
that's all I got to go on?
Yeah.
you already know who I mean, so cough it up.
there's a billing address and a delivery address.
are you Pierce Patchett?
I am.
are you soliciting for police charities?
last time you called my office.
go on down to the driveway. We'll talk there.
what can I do for you?
where were you last night?
I was here hosting a party.
tell me about Dick Stensland.
I don't know him, Mr.--?
officer White.
you know Sue Lefferts?
you know I do. You saw me with her.
how did you find me?
Nick's Liquor.
this is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
of course.
sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.
I'm investigating.
everything all right?
fine, Phillip, thank you.
what happened to the other guy, Buzz?
buzz Meeks no longer works for me.
Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve but didn't act it. Why?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.
she was a big doubles fan.
you're a known associate of a woman killed in a mass murder.
want to go downtown to discuss this?
is this official?
somehow I have the feeling this is more personal with you.
all right, then are you concerned about criminal matters peripheral to the murders?
not at the moment. -You're not obligated to report them?
why were Lefferts' eyes black?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
what little studio?
well, there's Gardner, Russell, Monroe, Turner.
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.
I use girls that look like movie stars.
sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
when the work was done, that's when you saw us.
it's why her mom couldn't I. D. her.
Jesus fucking Christ!
no, Pierce Morehouse Patchett.
I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'm saying.
if you persist, we'll meet with my attorney.
would you like Lynn Bracken's address?
I got her address.
find Susan's killer, Mr. White.
I'll give you a handsome reward.
whatever you desire!
I know you're not asleep.
what do you want?
my 5 bucks.
it was the only one I had.
right now?
Hey, doll face, tell him to leave us alone.
I understand.
okay, fine.
Oh, baby bad news.
you have to go.
go?
something very important has come up and you have to go.
I'll make it up to you.
I will, I promise.
excuse me.
is it the cops?
miss Bracken
I'm Officer White.
I've been expecting you, just not this soon.
Pierce called. He told me what happened to Sue.
everything all right, doll?
want me to get rid of him?
hit the road.
maybe I will maybe I won't.
LAPD. Get out of here or I'll have your wife come get you.
officer. -Councilman.
would you care for a drink?
Yeah, Scotch straight.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't friends.
know what I mean?
you sorry she's dead?
of course I am.
what kind of question is that?
do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
use words like that, you might make me mad.
but, do you know?
Yeah, I know.
Patchett's running whores cut to look like movie stars.
and, judging by his address, something bigger on the side.
he doesn't want any attention.
that's right. Our motives are selfish so we're cooperating.
so cooperate. Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
I don't know. I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
how'd she meet Patchett?
Pierce meets people.
sue had dreams of Hollywood and this is how they turned out.
thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
tell me about Pierce.
he's waiting for you to mention money.
want advice, Miss Bracken?
it's Lynn.
miss Bracken don't ever try to fucking bribe me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
I remember you from Christmas Eve.
you have a thing for helping women, don't you?
maybe I'm just fucking curious.
you say "fuck" a lot.
you fuck for money.
there's blood on your shirt.
an integral part of your job?
Yeah. -Do you enjoy it?
when they deserve it.
did they deserve it today?
I'm not sure.
but you did it anyway.
Yeah.
like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
actually, it was only two.
you're different, Officer White.
you're the first man in years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake.
you look better than Veronica Lake.
Pierce Patchett?
he takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.
he doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.
can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
he had you cut to look like Veronica Lake.
no.
I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.
and that's all the news that's fit to print.
it's nice meeting you.
I'd like to see you again.
for a date or an appointment?
I don't know.
for a date, I'd know your first name.
forget I asked.
it was a mistake.
Leonard Bidwell?
come down here and talk to us.
how's the left these days?
what's it to you?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.
I like your style.
what do you want, Mr. Policeman?
you got a brother in Folsom.
I put him there.
until 1970.
how'd you like to make it 1960?
I know the judge, and Lieutenant Exley is good friends with the D. A.
we're looking for 3 colored guys who like to shoot shotguns.
one owns a maroon Mercury coupe.
want me to snitch?
want to buy your brother 10 years?
it was 10 years, right?
Yeah, 10 years.
you don't have to say anything, just look at this list and point.
he's bad, so I'll just tell you.
sugar Ray Collins.
drives a maroon 49 coupe.
beautiful ride.
don't know about shotguns, but he gets his thrills killing dogs.
he's righteous trash.
look at that. It's five minutes from here.
Thanks.
I'll hear from you about my brother?
keep it up, Lenny. Up!
there it is. It's in the back.
one of ours. -Shit, somebody beat us here!
damn it! My glasses!
you're kidding!
well, just don't shoot me.
what are you doing here?
we were in the neighborhood.
what do you got? -Three 12-gauge pumps.
and cash.
so long, Vice. Badge of Honor, here I come.
fuck you! This is our collar.
quiet!
I'm ranking officer here.
we go as a team. End of story.
right.
how many ways in?
only one. Up the stairs.
he's very serious.
police! Don't shoot!
don't move.
ace him, Jack! Shut up.
anxious, aren't you?
don't kill them.
back, back, back!
get off me!
against the wall!
against the wall!
put your hands up!
get over there.
shut up! Hands behind your back!
so how's it feel getting out of the office?
this came from forensics.
burning clothes.
Casitas Youth Camp.
it's crowded in here, White.
these guys killed Stensland.
the ejection marks on the shells fired from the shotguns are identical to those on the shell casings found at the Nite Owl.
I want confessions, Edmund.
a night's stewing has softened them up.
I'll break them, sir.
are you sure golden boy is up to the task, Cap?
I think you'd be surprised what the lad is capable of.
you're 22. Aren't you, Ray?
did an officer work you over?
you're 22, right?
why do you keep asking that?
22 makes it a gas chamber bounce.
you should've pulled this caper years ago.
get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt transfer to Folsom a big man get yourself a sissy.
I don't truck with no sissies.
Louis.
what?
you did the Casitas Youth Camp with Louis.
why you keep asking me about Louis?
his business is his business.
sugar, Louis told me you went sissy up at Casitas.
you couldn't do the time, so you got a big white boy to look after you.
said they called you Sugar
because you gave it out so sweet.
Louis gave it up at Casitas.
I was the boss jock in my dorm!
Louis was the sissy!
Louis gave it up for candy bars!
he isn't got the sense of a dog!
you like to shoot dogs.
dogs got no reason to live.
feel the same way about people?
What're you trying to say?
we got the shotguns.
I don't own no shotguns.
why were you throwing clothes in the incinerator?
say what?
a neighbor said she saw you throwing clothes in the incinerator.
doesn't look good.
I am not talking till I see a judge.
were you on hop?
you were passed out when we arrested you.
ty and Louis fuck with that shit, not me.
where do they get their stuff?
man. Give me one to feed the D. A.
it'll make me look good and I'll say Sugar Ray's not a punk like his sissy partners.
all right.
tell me one more thing about Jones and Fontaine.
where do they get drugs?
roland Navarette.
he runs a hole-up on Bunker Hill.
and he sells red devils.
Exley's good, I'll give him that.
I'll take a break.
you know, Ray,
I'm talking about the gas chamber and you haven't asked me what this is about.
you got a big "guilty" sign around your neck.
that was masterful, Edmund.
he's ready to go.
give Jones the newspaper.
I want him primed.
take the cuffs off, so he can read it.
ray Collins just ratted you off.
said the Nite Owl was your idea.
I think it was Ray's idea.
you talk, I think I can save your life.
6 people are dead, and someone has to pay for it.
now, it can be you, or it can be Ray.
Louis, he called you queer.
at Casitas, you took it up the ass.
I didn't kill nobody!!
son you know what'll happen if you don't talk.
you'll go to the gas chamber. So admit what you did.
I didn't mean to hurt her.
maybe she's okay.
okay?
they're all in the morgue.
they were dead when you left them.
I just wanted to lose my cherry.
she don't die, so I don't die.
she don't die, so I don't die.
Louis, who's the girl?
what's her name?
who are you talking about?
was she at the Nite Owl?
listen to me, was she at the Nite Owl?
this paper shit isn't shit!
Where's the girl?
you kill her?
Louis lost his cherry, but things got out of hand.
you made her bleed.
she bled on your clothes, so you burned the clothes.
who said that?!
now, listen to me.
if she's alive, she's the only chance you've got.
I think she's alive. -You think?
where is she now?
did you leave her someplace?
where is she?
What're you doing?
white!
1 in 6!
Where's the girl?!
put the weapon down!
Where's the girl?!!
Sylvester Fitch
what?
Sylvester Fitch, 109 Avalon brown corner house, upstairs.
just give me one minute.
you got it.
nobody moves.
we're going in the front.
stay put until I give the word.
he went around back!
I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I'm sorry to ask you this.
I need to know when they left you.
get her to the hospital.
excuse me.
give your career a rest.
leave her alone.
a naked guy with a gun?
who'll believe that?
get the fuck away from me.
how'll it look in your report?
it'll look like justice.
that's what the man got.
justice.
you don't know the meaning of the word.
you think it means getting your picture in the paper.
go after criminals for a change.
Stensland got what he deserved and so will you.
it's best to stay away when his blood is up.
his blood's always up.
perhaps you should stay away from him altogether.
Raymond Collins, Ty Jones and Louis Fontaine.
they are considered armed and dangerous.
repeat. The Nite Owl suspects have escaped.
how'd they get out the window?
they jumped from the 2nd floor.
girl said they left her at 12.
they could get to the Nite Owl by 1.
the question was, where did they get their drugs?
I haven't gotten that far yet.
roland Navarette lives on Bunker Hill, runs a hole-up
anyone seen Jack Vincennes?
is something up?
I need some backup. Go -What? -Nothing. Let's go.
this should be it.
nobody moves!
you're under arrest.
don't shoot, man!
don't move! Don't move!
there he is.
you did good, kid.
you should've seen this place. Blood everywhere.
who would have thought? Shotgun Ed.
Yes. Shotgun Ed.
somebody get him cleaned up.
come on.
Edmund J. Exley has amassed a brilliant record in his 7 years with the Los Angeles Police Department.
recently, he evinced spectacular bravery in the line of duty.
it is our privilege to present him with our highest honor:
the Medal of Valor.
what kind of car was it? -It was a Ford.
Ford. Are you sure?
my husband always drove a Ford.
I know what they look like.
excuse me, ma'am. Just the facts.
light or dark? Light.
and that's really all I remember, Officer.
thank you. You've been a big help.
cut! That's a print.
big Jack! He's back!
Jack's back.
tell Mr. Patchett I have no intention of changing my vote.
it may surprise some that an official would admit to making a mistake but after due consideration
I am changing my position on the matter before the council.
go west, America,
was a slogan of Manifest Destiny.
today is that last step westward with no stop signs no traffic signals, from downtown to the beach in 20 minutes.
what were you going to start with?
prostitution?
gambling?
go back to Jersey, sonny.
this is the City of the Angels and you haven't got any wings.
nice to see you again. Take care.
I wondered when you'd knock on my door again, Officer White.
it's Bud.
bud.
why me?
I don't know.
this election is about the future of law enforcement in Los Angeles.
city Councilman Rogers represents that future.
so let's dig deep and get a moral man re-elected.
Ellis Loew wants to say a few words.
thank you, Brett Chase.
the talented star of Badge of Honor.
let me tell you,
I am so thrilled to be here.
big V.
good to see you back.
how they hanging, Sid?
down around my ankles.
you tight with the D. A. Jackie?
Yes.
Yeah. He tried to throw me off the force last Christmas.
how about some payback, big-time?
plus the usual 50 dollar donation to the Jack Vincennes retirement fund.
did you know the D. A. was a swish?
no kidding?
remember Matt Reynolds? Christmas Eve?
the Movie Premiere Pot Bust?
he just got off the honor farm.
what's he doing here?
Reynolds is acey-deucey, not to mention broke.
I'm getting him to fuck the D. A. for $100.
that's twice the $50 you got for wrecking his career.
come here, come here.
Jesus, don't bring him
that's D. A. Loew right there.
OK.
you need a drink?
Yeah.
look after him.
Matt, this is Jack.
no secrets between me and him.
how you doing? -I'm okay. How're you?
I'm good.
have we met before?
Yeah.
was it at a party?
it was something like that.
fleur-de-lis party, right?
right.
fleur-de-lis.
whatever you desire.
dope, hookers that look like movie stars.
Pierce Patchett has it all.
you could say that again.
Pierce, he's not like regular guys.
I dig him, but you know he scares me too.
Really?
how?
when I came out to L. A. this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Yeah, well get in line.
your courage, kid. Drink up.
I don't think I should do this.
it's not like you don't know how.
Jack's connected to Badge of Honor.
pull this off, you'll get a part.
I smell a comeback, don't you, Jack?
the D. A.'s free.
go introduce yourself. Go on.
tell him about the opening on the show.
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on this show.
but that's later on.
tonight, go on over there and pretend it's an acting job.
like show biz.
acting, that's it.
right. No one's going to know about this?
no.
it'll be our secret.
show biz.
that's it. Go on.
show biz.
if Reynolds works his charms, which I know he will they'll be at the Hollywood Center Motel, room 203.
meet me there at midnight for a photo shoot.
and maybe we can work in the Hollywood sign this time.
what do you know about Pierce Patchett?
I know what you know.
he's rich.
invested in the freeways, which'll make him richer.
Why?
I just keep hearing rumors, you know.
high-class porn, drugs, hookers that look like movie stars.
Patchett's what I call twilight.
he isn't queer or Red.
he cannot help me in my quest for prime sinnuendo.
as though Badge of Honor would touch that guy with a 10-foot pole after he's been Hush-Hush cover boy twice in one year.
see you soon.
midnight. I guarantee all kinds of illegal activity.
another? Yeah.
kid?
brother.
come on, you don't have to do this
thank you for what you did for me for killing those animals who raped me.
will you thank Officer White for me, please?
sure.
seeing him come through the door is about the only thing I remember.
thank God.
you remember what time the Negroes left you, right?
in your statement, you said they left you at midnight.
they might have.
they "might" have?
I don't know what time they left me.
I wanted them dead.
would anyone care that they raped a Mexican girl if they hadn't killed those white people at the Nite Owl?
I did what I had to do for justice.
Inez.
Exley, over here.
smile, Inez.
is he your hero?
fellas, how about this?
rape Victim Wheeled Out by Nite Owl Hero.
all they get is Veronica Lake.
I get Lynn Margaret Bracken.
Bisbee?
I grew up there.
I'm going back in a couple of years, open up a dress shop.
the girls in Bisbee need a little glamour.
Where'd this come from?
I was 12. My dad went after my mother with a bottle.
I got in the way.
so you saved her.
not for long.
I'm sorry. It's none of my business.
he tied me to the radiator.
I watched him beat my mother to death with a tire iron and he left me there.
three days before a truant officer found us.
they never found the old man.
is that why you became a cop?
to get even?
maybe.
do you like it?
I used to.
now it's all strong-arm, sitting duck stuff.
if I could get a chance to work Homicide like a real detective.
that prick, Exley, he shot the wrong guys.
whoever killed Stensland's still around.
I know it in here. I know it.
something's wrong with the Nite Owl.
I just can't prove it, that's all.
I'm not smart enough.
I'm just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless.
you're wrong.
you found Patchett. You found me.
you're smart enough.
bud White! What brings you down to the basement?
I got a couple of Nite Owl questions.
don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
anything bother you about it?
the fact that the pack-up boys haven't hauled this shit out of here yet.
the suspects' 3 shotguns match the strike marks on the shell casings.
what more do you want?
there's blood on the wall here.
I thought everyone got shot in the men's room.
that is Stensland's blood.
Stensland? Yeah.
blow to the head.
probably unconscious when they dragged him in the john.
did they hit anyone else?
no, but he was a cop.
probably tried to do something.
grilled cheese, black coffee.
someone was sitting next to him.
2 victims were women?
Yeah, Patti DeLuca, the night shift waitress, and a Susan Lefferts.
Susan Lefferts.
Yeah, what about her?
you're welcome!
Mrs. Lefferts
Mrs. Lefferts?
I'm Officer White, LAPD.
tell me about the boyfriend you mentioned at the coroner's office.
I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.
he was too old for you.
and you let him be fresh with me.
they came here one day when I wasn't home.
Mrs. Jensen next door said she saw Susie's boyfriend and another man and she heard a ruckus.
what was his name?
we weren't properly introduced.
Susie gave him a nickname, Muns or Luns.
Stens?
was it Stens?
maybe.
I don't know.
look.
that's him.
that's him.
you said a neighbor heard a ruckus.
was it outside? Inside?
outside.
and then Mrs. Jensen said they kept going under the house.
you have to leave now, officer.
what's through here?
just a room full of old things.
don't move that!
don't mind the smell.
I think a rat died behind the wall.
my Susie was a good girl.
she was never in any kind of trouble at all!
Leland Meeks.Never heard of you.
they call me Buzz.
was it a rat?
Yeah, a great big one.
here.
compliments of the Police Department.
stomach of the week from a motel homicide.
unemployed actor had frankfurter, French fries, alcohol and sperm.
hell of a last supper, don't you think?
anything bothering you about the Nite Owl case?
that you guys won't let it get filed away.
what do you mean?
bud White grilled me on it today.
bud White?
he's not as dumb as I thought.
did he say where he was going after he talked to you?
let my daughter rest in peace!
Mrs. Lefferts, I want to ask a few questions.
officer White already checked under the house.
under the house?
where? -Out back.
all he found was rodents.
I need an I. D. on this as soon as possible.
talk only to me on this one.
I need your help.
I'm busy right now. Why don't you ask your boys in Homicide?
I can't. I need someone outside of Homicide.
tail Bud White until he goes on duty this evening.
do me a real favor and leave me alone.
you make the Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
what?
it's a simple question.
why in the world do you want to dig deeper into the Nite Owl killings?
lieutenant?
Rollo Tomasi.
is there more or do I have to guess?
Rollo was a purse snatcher.
my father ran into him off-duty.
he shot my father 6 times and got away clean.
no one knew who he was.
I made the name up to give him personality.
what's your point?
Rollo Tomasi's the reason I became a cop.
I wanted to catch the guys...
who thought they could get away with it.
it was supposed to be about justice.
then somewhere along the way I lost sight of that.
why'd you become a cop?
I don't remember.
what do you want, Exley?
I want to solve this thing.
Nite Owl was solved.
no.
I want to do it right.
even if it means paying the consequences?
all right, college boy, I'll help.
but there's a case your boys in Homicide don't care about.
they think it's just another Hollywood "homo"-cide.
but I don't.
you help me with mine,
I'll help you with yours.
deal?
deal.
Johnny Stompanato.
officer Wendell White. How's tricks, paesano?
I amn't your paesano.
I amn't in the snitch business anymore.
you know a guy named Buzz Meeks?
works for Pierce Patchett.
should I?
you're muscle for hire. Meeks is muscle for hire.
you tell me.
Yeah, I remember now.
Meeks is a run-down ex-cop.
same as you're going to be some day.
that's all you'll get.
keep your 20 bucks.
what do I get if I give you your balls back, you wop cocksucker?
there was a rumor going around that Meeks had a line on a large supply of H.
And?
and nothing!
he skipped out.
bullshit.
how would Meeks get his hands on a large supply of heroin?
you're right.
it's probably bullshit.
even if he did, he could never unload it.
not without drawing all kinds of attention.
maybe that's why he's under a house in Elysian Park not smelling too good paesano.
maybe White's not so dumb after all.
we got Rita Hayworth at the morgue, and now Veronica Lake with White.
I think your case and my case are connected.
it's Fleur-de-Lis again.
fleur-de-lis?
whatever you desire.
porno.
high-class whores cut to look like movie stars.
who knows what else.
Reynolds, the kid that got killed, was involved.
so is Pierce Patchett.
the millionaire?
I think we should go talk to him.
first I want to brace Stompanato.
want an autograph?
write to MGM.
since when do two-bit hoods and hookers give out autographs?
what?
LAPD. Sit down.
who in the hell do you think you are?
take a walk, honey.
you are making a large mistake.
get away from our table.
shut up.
a hooker cut to look like Lana Turner is still a hooker.
she just looks like Lana Turner.
she is Lana Turner.
she is Lana Turner.
how was I supposed to know?
I believe the Nite Owl's your area of expertise, Mr. Exley.
I saw you on television getting your medal.
and you're that other Hollywood celebrity policeman, aren't you?
the Veronica Lake look-alike works for you.
she's one of your whores.
a vulgar term.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
why do men and women usually see each other?
let's try this on for size:
fleur-de-lis.
whatever you desire.
an actor named Matt Reynolds.
no? Nothing?
we want some answers.
we all want something.
the guy's as cool as they come.
lieutenant Exley, come in, please. Over.
Exley. The coroner wants to talk to you.
he says he has your I. D.
tell him Sergeant Vincennes is coming in to talk to him.
Yeah.
I'll drop you at your car.
where are you going?
Lynn Bracken's.
to find out why Patchett has her seeing Bud White.
see you at the Frolic Room.
Oh, great. You get the girl.
I get the coroner.
hush-hush, off the record and on the q. t.
I was just coming up to see you.
you get that I. D?
thank God for dental records. Stiff used to be a cop.
Leland Meeks.
buzz Meeks?
you knew him?
of him. He was around when I joined the force.
bad reputation. Thanks.
just the facts,Jack.
just the facts.
anything else?
Leland Meeks worked Vice '39-'41.
I need to see his arrest records.
miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I know.
bud told me all about you.
is that so?
and what did White have to say?
he said you were smart.
he also said you were a coward, and that you'd screw yourself to get ahead.
let's concentrate on my smarts.
Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?
taught you how to dress, talk and think.
I am very impressed with the results.
but I need answers.
and if I don't get them, I'll take you and Patchett down.
Pierce Patchett can take care of himself.
and I'm not afraid of you.
and you forget one thing, Lieutenant
Pierce also taught me how to fuck.
and he tells you who to fuck.
why does he have you fucking Bud White?
what makes you think I'm not seeing Bud because I want to?
it would be easier for you if there was an angle, wouldn't it?
you're afraid of Bud because you can't figure out how to play him.
he doesn't follow the same rules of politics as you do.
it makes him dangerous.
I can handle Bud White.
can you?
I see Bud because I want to.
I see Bud because he can't hide the good inside of him.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.
I see Bud because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.
I see Bud for all the ways he's different from you.
don't underestimate me.
the way you've underestimated Bud White?
fucking me and fucking Bud aren't the same thing.
stop talking about Bud White.
shit.
Jack Vincennes.
it's going on midnight.
I need 2 minutes, Dudley.
it's important.
good thing for you...
my wife and daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
do you remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
a disgrace as a police officer.
straight D fitness reports from every C. O.
he ever served under. Why?
12 years ago, he was on a Vice roust with Dick Stensland.
they questioned Pierce Patchett about a blackmail scam.
Patchett had Sid Hudgens photographing prominent businessmen with hookers.
anyway, charges were dropped.
insufficient evidence.
you were the supervising officer on that case.
remember anything about it?
what's this about, boy?
it has to do with a murder I've been working with Ed Exley on.
you're Narco, Jack, not Homicide.
since when do you work with Edmund Exley?
it's a private investigation.
I messed something up. I'm trying to make amends.
don't start trying to do the right thing, boyo.
you haven't had the practice.
buzz Meeks and Dick Stensland.
so, what does Exley make of this?
I haven't told him yet. I just came from the records room.
have you a valediction, boyo?
Rollo Tomasi.
sergeant Vincennes was killed by a. 32 slug to the heart.
time of death, approximately 1 a. m.
although he was found in Echo Park, forensics indicates the body was moved.
I want 2-man teams to scour that entire neighborhood.
our justice must be swift and merciless.
that is all.
might I have a word with you?
we're trying to run down a lead on an associate of Vincennes.
the records check has led to a dead end.
what's the name?
Rollo Tomasi?
you ever heard Vincennes mention him?
no. No, I haven't.
it's probably nothing. Still keep your eyes open, boyo.
I know it's unlikely, but suppose, just for a moment somebody had a lot of heroin, who would they go to move it?
white, in my office.
captain.
look, just give me a name.
Mickey Cohen.
captain? I could use your fearsome habits at the Victory Motel.
when?
now.
close the door, lad.
you're a bit of a puzzlement to me these days.
you don't seem your old cruel self.
and I had such grand plans for your future.
what plans?
you have your extracurricular activities and I have mine.
we must have a clarification session one of these days.
however right now we'll brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes.
so the question is can I count on you, lad?
yes or no? -Yes, sir.
I want to know everything you and Jack Vincennes talked about last night.
start with the I. D. on the corpse.
an ex-cop.
Leland "Buzz" Meeks.
an ex-cop?
did Jack know him?
only by reputation.
this is Sid Hudgens.
I'm willing to cooperate.
no need to tie me down.
it's for your own safety.
what can you tell us about Jack Vincennes?
Hollywood Jack? The Big V?
I can tell you he's on the night train to the Big Adios.
I had nothing to do with him getting killed, if that's what you mean.
but you were business associates.
what's that got to do with anything?
okay, so we worked together.
it was an information exchange.
I got him first-class collars, he got me good stories.
we were friends.
we'll drop that for the moment.
care to comment on Pierce Patchett?
you think he had something to do with Vincennes getting iced?
Wendell, I'd like full and docile cooperation on every topic.
okay, okay, okay. All right.
everyone knows Patchett's worth a boatload of greenbacks.
but the man has hobbies too.
he bankrolls B movies under the table.
and try this one on.
he's rumored to be a heroin snuffer.
all in all, a powerful behind-the-scenes strange-o.
And? And what?
reciprocity, Mr. Hudgens, is the key to every relationship.
he runs call girls.
primo tail fixed up to look like movie stars.
And?
blackmail shit.
in my car, in the trunk, under the rug.
Patchett got me to photograph this cop screwing this gorgeous slut named Lynn.
she looks like Veronica Lake.
leave him!
I said leave him be!
get him away from me!
back off! Back off!
I wouldn't trade places with Exley right now for all the whiskey in Ireland.
dudley
dudley, I thought you were going to let the dumb bastard kill me!
and you.
learn to pull your punches a little better.
you can uncaught me now, fellas.
fellas ,we had a deal.
you, me, Patchett, we're a team.
hush-hush.
anything? -Nothing.
Meeks never made an arrest the entire time he worked Vice?
someone must've pulled the files.
what about the daily report books?
they'd be buried in the basement.
find them.
did you talk to Exley?
come in out of the rain.
I want to know what happened with Exley.
just come in.
are you going to tell me what happened with Exley?
we talked.
tell me about him.
later.
you fucked him.
you fucked him.
I thought I was helping you.
I'm glad you're here.
I need you to see this.
wait.
dudley killed Jack.
he wants you to kill me.
he showed you the photo, didn't he?
didn't he?
think!! Goddamn you, think!!
get out!
dudley
I checked the daily report books.
dudley, Buzz Meeks and Stensland go way back.
I knew Stensland lied to me.
Lefferts' mother I. D.'d Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend.
Stensland pretended he didn't know Meeks...
or her the night that I met Lynn.
Stensland and Meeks what the hell were they up to?
I don't know.
but I think Stens killed Meeks over heroin.
what heroin?
Johnny Stompanato told me that Meeks had heroin for sale.
Meeks ends up dead.
Stensland dies at the Nite Owl.
it wasn't the Negroes.
the rape victim lied in her statement.
the first guys to the Mercury coupe were Breuning and Carlisle.
dudley's guys.
they planted the shotguns.
they'd have killed the Negroes too if Jack and I hadn't shown up.
dudley framed them because they were Negroes and had records.
he knew there'd be no questions asked if they were killed resisting arrest.
somehow this is all connected to Jack's angle.
Sid Hudgens the pictures to blackmail Ellis Loew.
a kid got murdered.
to figure this out, we need to work together.
why are you doing this?
the Nite Owl made you.
you want to tear all that down?
with a wrecking ball.
want to help me swing it?
let's go see Ellis Loew.
find out what the District Attorney knows.
you can't go in there.
want me to call the police, Mr. Loew?
ask for Capt. Dudley Smith.
tell him we're discussing...
an unemployed actor's death at a Sunset Strip motel.
these are the police.
what do you want?
I want D. A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith and Patchett 24 hours a day.
I want you to get a judge to authorize wiretaps on their home phones.
I want authorization to check their bank records.
on what evidence?
call it a hunch.
absolutely not.
dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of the department.
I won't smear his and Patchett's name without
without what?
them smearing yours first?
what do they have?
pictures of you and Matt Reynolds with your pants down?
you have any proof?
the proof had his throat slit.
so far, you're not denying it.
I won't dignify this with answers.
now if you gentlemen will excuse me
I have a press conference for Jack Vincennes that I have to prepare for.
unless you came to wipe my ass,
I believe we're through.
don't pull that good cop-bad cop crap.
I practically invented it.
so what if some homo actor is dead.
boys, girls, ten of them get off the bus to L. A. everyday.
pull him off me!!
I don't know how.
I know you think you're the A-number-one hotshot, but here's the juice.
if I kill you, 10 lawyers will take your place tomorrow.
they just won't come on a bus.
okay!
dudley and Patchett, they.
Oh, my God!
I wouldn't play ball so they set me up! I gave in!
but the kid heard everything so they killed him.
Why? -What are Dudley and Patchett up to?
taking over Mickey Cohen's rackets.
because of those pictures I couldn't prosecute them!
Oh, Jesus!
help me up!
is that how you ran the good cop-bad cop?
Patchett?
looks like his bodyguard had a conflict of interest.
suicide note.
says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out his pornography scam.
slicing himself open wasn't his idea.
2 of his fingers are broken.
they held him there.
or drugged him.
dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Patchett's dead.
he sent you after me.
Lynn.
west Hollywood Sheriff.
they're closer than we are.
I'll get the car.
keys!
we took her to the station for safekeeping.
hold her as Joan Smith.
and no one sees her unless I okay it.
someone worked her over.
she wouldn't say who.
see you, Exley.
we should talk to Lynn.
you do it.
what will you do?
I'm going to talk to Sid Hudgens.
compliment him on his performance at the Victory Motel.
remember, Bud, we need evidence.
I'll get the evidence.
are you okay?
you okay?
bud hates himself for what he did.
I know how he feels.
I need to know what you can give me on Dudley Smith.
he's a police captain in business with Patchett.
I've never heard of him.
do you have a place to stay?
I'll be okay.
nobody goes in without official I. D!
he's okay. Let him through.
what happened?
someone beat him to death, and stole a bunch of files.
must have dug up garbage on the wrong guy.
we got it narrowed down to 1000 suspects.
sergeant White dispatch got a call for you.
lieutenant Exley wants you to meet him at the Victory Motel.
you wanted to meet here?
you called it. I thought Hudgens was-- -Hudgens is dead.
let's get out of here.
it's too late.
you figured it was a set-up but came anyway?
a lot of bad stuff happened here.
it's as good a place as any for it to end.
clip.
all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
now's your chance.
he died in the line of duty, didn't he?
bud.
goddamn it!
you okay?
Yeah.
come on. Easy.
move!
Rollo Tomasi.
who is he?
you are.
you're the guy who gets away with it.
Jack knew it.
and so do l.
are you going to shoot me or arrest me?
good lad.
always the politician.
let me do the talking.
after I'm done, they'll make you Chief of Detectives.
hold up your badge so they'll know you're a policeman.
you think you can talk your way out of this, Lieutenant?
no ,but I can tell the truth.
during our investigation of events surrounding the Nite Owl case
Jack Vincennes, Bud White and I learned the following:
your golden boy's throwing his whole life away.
the 3 Nite Owl suspects while guilty of kidnapping and rape were innocent of the multiple homicides at the Nite Owl.
the gunmen were most likely
Los Angeles police officers Michael Breuning and William Carlisle and a third man who may or may not have been Captain Dudley Smith.
the objective:
the elimination of another police officer
richard Stensland who, along with former LAPD officer Leland "Buzz" Meeks also committed multiple homicides on behalf of Captain Smith and then betrayed him over 25 pounds of heroin the retrieval of which was the ultimate motivation behind the Nite Owl killings.
beginning with the incarceration of Mickey Cohen
capt. Smith has been assuming control of organized crime in Los Angeles.
this includes the assassinations of Mickey Cohen lieutenants the systematic blackmail of city officials and the murders of Susan Lefferts,
Pierce Patchett, Sid Hudgens and Sergeant Jack Vincennes.
captain Smith admitted as much to me before I shot him at the Victory Motel.
that's it.
well the press will have a field day.
Christ! It'll stain the Department for years.
decades.
if we can get the kid to play ball who's to say what happened?
maybe Dudley Smith died a hero.
good idea. -lf we get the press to play.
want to tell me what you're smiling about?
a hero.
how'd he know what we said?
he couldn't have heard us.
in this situation you'll need more than one.
it is my pleasure to present this award to
detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley two-time Medal of Valor recipient.
next year the LAPD will move into its new facility.
with leaders like Edmund Exley the image of fat cops stealing apples will be left behind and Los Angeles will finally have the police force it deserves.
you just couldn't resist.
they're using me. So for a while, I'm using them.
come on.
thanks for the push.
congratulations, Lieutenant Exley.
some men get the world, others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
a mutiny.
I was afraid something like this would happen when you told everybody about Danforth.
I did this.
Alex, you told 300 trained killers the government has a gun to their head.
not all of them want to stick around to see what happens next.
Rachel, we need to lay low.
division will never get shut down.
we are going to get there, Chris.
we are going to be free.
Rachel says that she's the leader, but that isn't true.
if Division is left standing, more people are going to die.
give me the gun.
the plan will still work. - How?
you're going to have to take the fall.
make it look like you took my gun.
I should have been here.
look at him.
you say you're trying to help the people in here?
that's all Ryan was ever trying to do
help you, get you guys a new life.
look at him!
Rachel, I know you're scared, but this isn't the old Division.
cooperate, and there's still a way out for you.
tell us who you're working with.
we know you had help trying to blow the tracker array, and someone tried to get you out of interrogation.
when you shot Ryan.
so give us a name before anyone else gets hurt.
you got me. It's over.
Oh, this is nowhere near over.
she won't break.
well, maybe it's time Nikita used some enhanced measures.
she did with Ari.
Ari was an enemy. Rachel's one of us.
not anymore.
Rachel's just the tip of the iceberg.
the only reason that she is in here is because a lot of other people feel the same way that she does.
even if we hunt her friends down, it will not solve the problem.
so you're saying you agree with her?
I'm saying I understand her.
this is Ops.
we're getting some flash traffic that I think you need to see.
agent Harris: Emergency alert.
death confirmed.
it's Danforth.
he's dead.
if you're just joining us, this is a breaking story.
commander Evan Danforth, special advisor to the President, has died.
he collapsed earlier today at a Georgetown restaurant.
preliminary reports indicate a ruptured brain aneurysm.
brain aneurysm?
it's hard to diagnose. It's easy to fake.
right out of the Division playbook, which means- - Amanda.
Amanda? Why would she kill Danforth?
because he was shielding us from the President.
only after you blackmailed him.
Nikita played the only card we had.
the point is is Amanda found out about this.
she knows, by killing Danforth, it would turn the heat up on Division.
Owen called it in. He's been surveilling Danforth.
Owen, where are you?
I'm on site.
they're taking the body out right now.
did you see anything out of the ordinary?
no. He was at the same place he had lunch at every day.
same table, same time. Just like clockwork.
once she knew his routine, it was easy.
Amanda saw the pattern, and she exploited a weakness.
we dropped the ball on surveillance.
surveillance.
when Alex and I broke into Danforth's house, we left some surveillance equipment there
phone taps, keystroke loggers. The feds do a sweep, they're going to find it.
Yeah, but they won't be able to trace that back to Division.
if the President learns there's unidentified tech in Danforth's place, she'll know that we're behind it.
she'll think we watched him, then killed him.
Owen, I need you to get to Danforth's place and clean the scene.
you want the quick version, or the full works?
the full works, but also quick.
copy that.
the President's going to want to talk to Ryan about this.
what are we supposed to do when she calls?
say Ryan lost his voice? He's on extended vacation?
no. We tell her the truth.
we tell her that Ryan's been in an accident but that he's expected to make a full recovery.
until then...
you're in charge.
she trusted a Navy man to manage Division before.
she can do it again.
you think that'll be enough to keep her finger off the SEAL trigger?
commander DANFORTH'S APARTMENT - 3: 15 P. M.
ops, we have a problem.
no response.
I'm going out there. - Take a team.
don't worry. It's just a mild paralytic.
I wouldn't want you to end up like poor commander Danforth.
unlike him, you're far more valuable alive, aren't you, Owen?
or should I say "Sam"?
you still alive? Sam?
Owen, are you okay?
what happened?
you called in, said there was a problem, and then radio silence.
where are they?
who's they?
I mean Danforth.
Danforth's dead. You don't remember?
it's been over an hour since you called in.
what? - My name.
first special forces operational detachment Delta.
I remember.
what's happening to him?
he suffered a concussion, and it looks like it's causing his brain to rewire sections that were previously damaged.
and that's what's bringing his memories back?
essentially.
it's rare, but it's been known to happen.
you need to relax.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
were you attacked?
was somebody already there?
no. Nobody was there.
it's like I had a seizure or something.
I must have hit my head on the floor when I fell.
it's a good thing we recovered you when we did.
the CIA got to Danforth's place right after Nikita pulled you out of there.
they find anything? - No, no, no.
we finished cleaning the place.
Birkhoff's hacking their system just to make sure, but I'm going to go see how he's doing.
you should take it easy.
thank you, Captain Obvious.
still hurt? - No.
I had worse hangovers in the army.
when you were Sam.
Yeah.
so it really is coming back.
in flashes, like a strobe light.
I remember my unit going down. I was hit.
and Amanda?
do you remember why she tried to wipe your memories in the first place?
no.
there has to be a reason why she did this to you.
we figure that out, we can find out why she tried to grab you back in Russia.
what the hell are you doing?
they were worried you might have been followed.
they?
how's Rachel?
she's holding up.
but for how long?
this is Division. They are going to break her.
even if they don't, once Ryan wakes up, he'll I. D. you as the shooter.
let me worry about that. The plan is still on track.
we get everyone new identities and money to start new lives, then we get out.
Rachel too. All of us.
we're going to have to do something about the trackers.
Birkhoff's decentralized the entire array, so we can't just take out one server to bring down the system.
that means we need software access to bring the trackers down.
we'll never get that.
let me handle it. - How?
Birkhoff is the only one who has access to those systems.
I told you that I will handle Birkhoff.
nerd, we need you.
I'm busy here. - This is important.
Yeah, well, I'm trying to make sure that if the rabble rousers in our midst launch another attack, they don't bring down our whole network.
is it more important than that?
this could lead to Amanda.
okay, what is it?
check any records on Sam Matthews.
your alter ego? I already did.
Mikey filled me in.
there is no trace of any Delta operative by that name.
Amanda must have wiped your file.
did a thorough job too.
usually there are some digital echoes left behind, but with Owen or Sam, whatever your name is--nada.
try Ray Kramer, Enrique Morales, and Darren Stoffer.
who are they? - Members of my old unit.
we were in Kosovo.
the guys in my unit were smuggling heroin.
I caught them.
and, they shot me.
I was able to take them all down.
I killed them all.
Amanda was right. I killed all my friends.
bingo.
army special Ops, assigned to support NATO peacekeepers in the Balkans.
all listed as killed in a helicopter crash in Kosovo in '99.
division cover story much?
looks like there was one survivor
a corporal Scott Atkins.
you remember him?
he tried to help when the others turned against me.
honorably discharged in '05.
last known address is in Baltimore.
all right, looks like you're going to visit an old friend.
first we blackmailed him, and then we kill him?
president's not going to like this.
Hey, Michael.
people are jittery, worried about what Danforth's death means.
well, they know he was ready to kill us all.
they also stood here and watched us as we blackmailed him.
they don't know what to think.
is this good for us, is it bad?
well, this couldn't have happened at a worse possible time.
all right, everyone, listen up.
stop what you're doing.
first, we had nothing to do with Danforth's death.
this wasn't some sort of covert kill, and second, this changes nothing.
the President is aware of our situation and is committed to letting us see our mission through.
so I'm here to tell you that everything is under control.
we just need to focus and keep doing our jobs.
now, as you were.
are you serious?
tell me you haven't thought about it.
Birkhoff, you're the only person I can talk to about this.
I know what you mean.
Nikita, Mikey, Ryan-- they're too close to it. They can't see it.
so you'd really leave Division?
why not?
every mission leads to another.
every secret leads to ten more.
Ryan's in a coma, and for what?
because we have an obligation to clean up somebody else's mess?
I haven't told anybody this, but right after you alerted the troops to the seal threat,
I asked Sonya to leave here with me.
what did she say?
she turned her back on me and walked out the door.
she's right. I'd be letting Nikki down.
I'd be leaving a lot of people in the lurch.
what if you didn't have to? Leave them?
what do you mean?
michael asked me to check those new security protocols.
you finish?
Yeah, sure.
did I interrupt something?
no.
BALTIMDRE, MARYLAND
looks like your friend had a really rough time since leaving the army.
I'd probably be in worse shape than him if it wasn't for you.
you always knew what was best for me, didn't you?
yeah? What's it about?
Hey, Scotty. Been a long time.
Sam?
no. Can't be. You're dead!
we're not here to hurt you.
you don't know me like he does.
the nice thing about killing a drug dealer is they always tend to have what you need to erase the job.
Owen, something's happened to you.
let me help.
you already helped.
you found Scotty for me.
you said he was your friend.
he was.
Amanda was wrong when she said I killed all my friends.
one got away.
not anymore.
Owen, let me go.
I'll help you fix this.
there's nothing to fix.
I remember now.
everything.
my unit was smuggling drugs, but I wasn't the whistle-blower.
I was the leader.
I organized the whole operation, but they tried to cut me out.
what the hell?
Sam. This isn't what it looks like.
good.
cause it looks like you're moving product without me, and I know you wouldn't do that.
right, guys?
no way.
we just intercepted an unscheduled delivery.
don't worry.
you'll get what's coming to you.
you still alive?
Scotty's mistake was not finishing the job.
you get a man down, you finish him.
else it's going to bite you in the ass.
it might not happen right away, it might take ten years, but it's going to happen eventually.
am I right, Scotty?
operator. How may I assist you?
you can shut up.
I'm talking to the bitch who's tapping this phone.
call me back.
let's talk Nikita.
Amanda.
once she restored my memory, she knew I'd come looking for Atkins.
I half thought I'd find her in the house.
Owen's a tool.
no, Amanda did this to you.
she created some kind of... delusion.
I don't know, but this isn't you.
you don't get it, do you?
Owen was the delusion.
he was just a whipped, little puppy dog following you around.
I mean, it felt like I was medicated for the last ten years. - Why would Amanda do that?
why would she create someone like Owen?
you are so obsessed with that woman, aren't you?
okay.
from what I remember, according to Percy, the perfect candidate for Division was a troubled, violent killer with low self-esteem.
does that remind you of anybody?
I mean, they didn't want thinkers, planners, leaders.
they wanted to do all the thinking for themselves.
so Amanda, being Amanda, took her little needles and blunted my edge.
something about judgment centers around the brain.
take a born leader, and turn him into a loyal follower.
a guardian.
no.
no.
you can't tell me the man that I know
the one who saved my life, the one who loved Emily
that that man doesn't exist?
Emily didn't know who I was.
I didn't know who I was.
if she knew, she wouldn't have been with me.
this is Sam.
it's been a long time.
I have to admit, I thought you might call Atkins before killing him.
you're moving a bit faster than I expected.
had a lot of time to make up for.
meet me at Ellwood Park at midnight.
and why would I do that?
same reason you're tapping this phone.
you knew I'd come with what you want.
be prepared to pay cause it's going to cost you.
you're not really going to go through with this.
you can fight her. I can help you.
Oh, she'll get what's coming to her, after I get mine.
you're not really surprised this is who I am, are you?
I mean...
deep inside, you always knew what I was.
you just didn't want to believe it.
Where's the bad cop?
no bad cops.
I'm here as a friend.
yeah?
then let me go.
that's up to you.
tell me who else you're working with.
you know, your Division record was outstanding
five sanctioned solo kills, seven missions as team leader, all clean successes.
except for that last one in Madrid.
what happened there?
a member of your exfil squad went down.
your orders were to leave him, but you went back for him, got caught in the crossfire.
said you spent three months recovering in medical from those bullet wounds.
now, you know what it means to be responsible for the lives of your people, and I am telling you that your friends are following a very dangerous path.
if you give me their names, they'll be fine.
my friends will be fine when they are free.
but we both know that's not how it's going to end.
division will come after you, with or without a tracker, and this time, it won't be to put you into custody.
it will be to kill you, to kill all of you.
that is how this is going to end.
so...
are you really going to let that happen?
if I gave you access to the server, could you reroute tracker control?
not with Birkhoff's security protocols in place.
you have to disable those first from his station.
what happened? I thought you were taking care of him.
still working on it. - There is another way.
take control of Ops. Ryan's out of commission.
Nikita's off on one of her personal missions.
we have a window here.
out of the question. - You heard Michael.
he thinks it's business as usual.
nothing is going to change unless we do something about it.
we don't have the numbers.
we can get the numbers.
word is spreading fast. - No!
no more recruiting people until we get a handle on this tracker problem.
we've got to be smart, wait for our moment.
I will get everyone out, safely.
check him.
he's clean.
and you're stupid.
what's the matter?
you don't have a plan for this?
that was unnecessary.
seemed necessary to me.
you got the money?
what's this?
50000
that's it?
I get you Nikita, you think it's worth 50 grand?
this is what's going to happen.
I'm going to give you a bank account number, and you're going to transfer all of your funds into it.
the entire Tasarov bankroll. You understand?
there is no more bankroll. That's all of it.
my goal was never money.
sucks to be you.
there's another way.
the Black Box.
a lot of people would pay for its secrets, a lot more than $50, 000, and right now, there's a small window of time where Division still thinks you're Owen.
you could go back and get it.
that's not a bad angle. Thanks.
but who would you sell it to?
I have all the contacts.
your only avenue to them is through me.
I'm going to be so happy when I'm done with you people.
wait for my call.
what about Nikita?
any progress with Rachel?
not yet, but I think I'm starting to get through to her.
Michael, it's Owen.
Owen? What happened?
Amanda was waiting for us.
I tried to fight them off, but there was too many of 'em.
what about Nikita?
Amanda has her.
is there an active threat on site?
no, they cleared out.
all right, stay put. I'll bring an Alpha team.
all right.
Michael, Amanda must have a plan for her.
she'll keep her alive.
Yeah, but for how long?
I'm taking an Alpha team out there.
you stay here and start the sweep.
check the satellites, the cell towers, traffic cams, all of it.
Birkhoff, give Alex full command code clearance.
you're in charge.
how do you like my new lair?
it somehow suits you.
I'd been hoping you'd come by for a visit.
Sam just made that happen sooner than expected.
remember what I said?
you told me that the people I love would betray me, but you had to destroy Owen's mind.
you had to turn him into a completely different person for him to betray me.
that's not winning, that's cheating.
I'm not talking about Owen.
I was very specific, remember?
what did I say about her?
you said that...
you made her, and like everything you love
she will turn against you.
which is exactly what Alex has done, with a little help from me of course.
Dana found some traffic cam footage that could be Amanda.
it's grainy, inconclusive. Can you help her?
Yeah, no sweat.
I got a new full-spectrum analysis process, should clean it up.
where is she? - Logistics.
with Owen, the solution was to build a wall.
a bit crude, I admit, but the memory wipe did its job.
with Alex, I needed a more elegant method.
Alex is still Alex. She remembers who she is.
that's because this time, I didn't need a wall.
what I needed was a bridge.
Alex is a survivor, and like most survivors, she carries the guilt of that.
her father died. She lived.
she had escaped the world of sex slavery but left many girls behind to suffer.
I needed to connect the pain of her past with her present circumstances in Division, so I introduced her to someone who could link those two worlds.
look out!
Larissa?
the girl she was trying to save?
a hallucination.
during her stay with me, Alex thought she was in a bed when she was really in my chair.
larissa was an idea I projected into Alex's mind
an innocent young woman who had lost everything, still working for the people who killed her family.
parallels, anyone?
I stimulated the empathetic regions of her brain, gave her a few suggestions.
you can't leave now, Alex.
Larissa's hurt.
she needs your help.
let me see. - Let me see.
keep pressure on it.
keep pressure on it.
her own mind filled in the rest of the story.
she blamed me for Larissa's death.
transference.
Alex survived but couldn't save Larissa.
that feeling of being powerless, she needed someone to blame.
who else but the most powerful figure in her life?
you.
no.
Alex has defeated your mind games before.
she's a good person.
she's not going to forget that.
and I wouldn't want her to...
read-only RESTRCIONS APPLY
because there's no telling how far Alex will go to save the people who depend on her.
command APRVILEQES RECOGNIZED
she will sacrifice everything before letting them die like Larissa.
security PROTOCOLS DEACTIVRTED
everything.
all you can do is sit there and wait for it to happen.
Owen, are you okay?
you're lucky Amanda left you alive.
I wasn't the target.
once she got Nikita, she was gone.
Birkhoff, any leads?
none yet, but I got everybody in here on the hunt.
come on, I'll catch you up on where we are.
shouldn't you be in medical?
in a minute. I had a thought.
that's a new one.
What'd you say to me?
easy. It's a joke.
of course.
what's your thought?
I think Amanda might be making a play for the Black Box.
you mean like another trade? Nikita for the box?
maybe.
or she's got a mole inside that could use the distraction to steal it outright.
impossible.
it's in Ryan's safe with a biometric lock, and considering Ryan's condition right now,
I don't think anybody's going to be getting in there anytime soon.
charming as ever.
the thing is, I hated Percy, but I got him.
you were either valuable, or you were dead.
simple as that.
but you?
you poke around in people's heads for fun.
you manipulate who they become.
I help them become what they should have been.
I fix what was broken.
this is important work we're doing.
did someone fix you?
or was the problem that you were too broken for them to even bother?
I didn't need anyone to fix me.
I did that for myself.
well, I couldn't.
I needed help-- your help.
and I passed on what I learned from you to Alex.
I thought you didn't make Alex. You made a point of saying that.
I didn't remake Alex in my own image. I didn't need to do that.
she already was me, lying on the floor, trying to kill herself, believing that she was worthless because she had nothing to live for.
I saw that, and I thought...
I could help her.
because you used to be her.
and you used to be me.
transference, right?
that's what this is all about.
you're trying to break me the way someone broke you.
though, when the people you loved betrayed you, I'm doubting there was a cranial needle involved.
I have a feeling they made that move of their own free will.
what's wrong?
I think someone's been using my terminal.
did they do anything?
no. Critical systems are all secure.
they'd need command code access to get into those anyway.
I told these doofuses to stay off my station.
Sean? What are you doing?
I was going to ask you the same question.
where are you going?
I don't have to explain myself.
Sean, wait!
what am I going to find in here, Alex?
let's just go upstairs, and I'll explain everything.
you've been different ever since South Ossetia.
aggressive, secretive.
this again? I told you
you and Rachel were the only ones in the room when Ryan got shot, and...
I saw you use your command code clearance at Birkhoff's station.
it's you, isn't it? Behind this whole mutiny?
it's not a mutiny, Sean. You don't understand.
you're right, I don't.
I have to do this. - Why?
if I don't get everyone out of Division, more people are going to get hurt.
you mean like Ryan.
help us. - What?
you're the one who always said how dangerous this place is, how I had to get out of here.
that was about you.
and what about everyone else?
we have a chance to save them, Sean.
all of them.
are they down here?
how many of them are there?
more than enough.
Chris, back off!
he knows too much. He could expose us all.
he isn't going to say anything.
he's with us.
find that hard to believe.
how did you get out?
people are joining our cause from all over, including security.
Rachel, listen to me. Sean is helping us.
who do you think shut down the trackers?
the trackers are down?
not yet, but when Michael went off-site, he put Sean in charge.
Sean used his clearance to bypass security protocols.
we can access them at any time now.
division's responsible for my mother's death.
you think I have any loyalty to this place?
you know what this means?
now's the time.
what are you talking about?
we're going to take Ops.
we have the numbers.
and if the tracker server really is vulnerable, we can strike now before Birkhoff or anyone else can turn the security protocols back on.
we don't need to do this.
I can still get everyone out quietly and safely.
we go in there, guns blazing, it'll be a bloodbath.
it'll be their blood. - This is not the plan!
the plan has changed.
we're getting everyone out, tonight!
Hello, there. It's been a long time.
going somewhere?
following up on a hunch.
is that why you visited Ryan first?
his guards have orders to report all entries.
the first thing that bothered me was, why would Amanda take Nikita and not you?
then, Birkhoff told me about your Black Box theory, and I thought, that's...funny...
how you never mentioned that to me.
Yeah. What can I say?
memory's not my strong suit.
take him to holding.
I said- - you're not in charge anymore.
excuse me?
what?
I'm on your side.
what do you think I was just doing?
keep your head down until this is over.
until it's over?
no, no, no, no, I'm going to get out of here right now.
no one leaves until we've secured the facility.
everyone, stand down!
we're taking charge.
what?
stop!
stop! No shooting!
no one needs to get hurt.
we have Michael in custody, and we control the exits.
all right. Disable the trackers, and transfer the money.
once that is done, then we can get everyone out.
no.
we also have to make sure they can never come after us because they will.
attention, Division personnel.
there's been a change in leadership.
ops is now under the control of those who want to get out of this hellhole.
those who are with us will get new lives, free of Division forever.
those who are against us, they will be shot on sight.
it's your choice.
Rachel, what are you doing?
what needs to be done.
we have a problem.
hold on. I think you should hear this.
go ahead.
there's been a coup in Division.
they've taken over Ops, instituted a lockdown.
I have the Black Box, but I can't get out.
you're resourceful.
I'm sure you'll find a way. Good luck.
so it begins.
five bucks she takes him out.
not if she sleeps with him first.
is this a sparring match or a mating ritual?
both.
I'm afraid I don't understand the dynamics of the male-female relationship.
and you probably never will, Kitt.
come on, he wants to learn.
we should teach him.
see, this so-called sparring session is how they say let's play a little "how's your father"?
without actually having to say it.
why not simply ask for sex?
cause it reeks of desperation. - He should know.
I did detect a rise in hormone levels when Mike and Sarah started hitting one another.
now you're starting to get it.
not bad.
maybe if you put a little more oomph into it.
like that?
is this another example of an indirect request for intimacy?
she's straddling him.
I'd say that's pretty direct.
Mr. Torres is approaching.
duck! Kitt, screen off!
Mike! - Yeah?
briefing in ten minutes.
you're going out.
I need a shower.
me too.
me too. - Me too.
Billy, your hormone levels elevated with Zoe's when you hit on top of each other.
does that mean that you also want to play "how's your father"?
no.
this is all very perplexing.
can I borrow your shampoo?
look at my sexy man.
here we go.
I see answers.
Oh, boy.
now that's shock and awe, people.
you have everything on screen?
everything as of three minutes ago.
this is their last live screen.
I smell foreplay.
freshly showered foreplay.
what are we looking at?
Bonnie and Clyde.
you'll like these two, Mike.
they hacked into the treasury and transferred all senatorial and congressional salaries to Iraqi war widows through untraceable wire transfers.
not bad. - Oh, they're good.
real good. - They're anarchists.
and they're getting more brazen by the day.
they started with soft targets and they're working their way up.
their website states that their primary objective is to take down the military industrial complex of the United States.
of which we are a part.
if their online following keeps growing at its present rate, they might actually be able to do it.
these guys are becoming a pop phenomenon.
top hit on all search engines.
what do they call themselves?
Nikki and Max for a free America.
you aren't serious.
unfortunately, I am.
wow, they're hot.
I think Sarah should come with me on this one.
I bet you do.
Yeah, I should go with Mike.
I don't think that's a good idea.
dad, I think a female perspective will be a valuable asset on this one.
she's absolutely right.
Kitt, have you figured out where they'll hit next?
I have factored in all known variables, including, but not limited to online chatter, websites, blogs.
And?
and I have deducted the probable location of their next target.
the town of Hastings.
you're guessing, Kitt?
deduction, logic, and probability are not guessing.
a guess is a prediction about the outcome made without factual evidence or support.
I do not guess, Mike.
why didn't you tell him who Nikki is?
cause they don't need to know.
and the FBI doesn't want it public.
mark my words.
this is gonna blow up in our faces.
so? - So.
so we're alone.
let's talk. - Come on.
it's not like we're ever really...alone.
what, kitt?
he's cool.
actually, my core temperature is running a bit high due to the incline and low altitude.
what about Billy...Zoe, Torres?
your dad?
cause nobody has anything better to do than spy on Michael knight all day.
I have nothing better to do.
me neither. Got all the time in the world.
we're on a mission.
I like to keep personal stuff and work stuff separate, that's all.
so why did you want me to come?
what, you didn't wanna come?
no, you said,"Sarah should come with me on this one."
cause I thought you wanted to come.
what about the whole female perspective thing?
what about the whole rec room, shower thing?
I just thought...
what? - Oh, I get it.
you're gonna play it like that.
like what? - I don't know.
Hey, guys.
there's lots of chatter on the web about Nikki and Max's next target, and the number 15 keeps coming up.
15? An address, a date, a highway?
Kitt, analyze the number 15 and Hastings with respect to the previous targets of Nikki and Max.
I can provide no meaningfully relevant results using Hastings and the number 15.
I'll stay on it.
you guys okay? - We're fine.
Yeah, we're okay. Why?
just checking. No big.
outtie.
how long do you think?
I say he goes first.
I say you're misreading the whole dynamic.
he's all coiled up and hinky.
hinky?
Mike is loose as a goose.
a man with a plan. A dude in a mellow mood.
you rhyme like a white boy and not a beastie boy.
ten bucks he breaks before she does.
make it a double sawbuck.
you're on.
that could be anything.
there's gotta be some kind of pattern to it.
what? - Nothing.
he folded like a cheap lawn chair.
no way! It's completely innocent conversation.
he's practically drooling.
him?
Sarah can barely keep her hands off my boy.
are we watching the same movie?
we're doing this all for you.
that's right.
you can count on us.
we are your answers.
these crazy kids.
sure, just two misguided teens in a hot car blowing things up.
well, the hazardous waste facility that they destroyed was named in a class-action suit.
so you think they're doing the public a service?
no, come on.
country was born in violence and dissent.
it's always been with us.
well, I appreciate the homage to the founding fathers, but anarchy is not the answer, Charles.
Yeah, well, one man's anarchist, another man's Robin Hood.
they're dangerous and reckless.
period.
depends on your point of view.
I don't see how you can look at it any other way.
well, maybe to the untrained eye we're the ones riding around in a hot car blowing things up.
all right, this is Max...and Nikki...
we shall see you guys next time.
we love you. - Ow, peace!
they're entering Hastings.
I synchro'd the traffic signals on approach with Kitt's speed.
it should save them a couple of minutes.
awesomeness.
how did you hack the grid?
I repurposed that software firewall you invented and slipped it in as a trojan horse to the traffic control computer in hastings.
great minds, right?
I'm uploading a list of motels to Kitt.
look, this one has a vibrating bed.
hope they brought quarters.
they should just get it over with, right?
Absolutely. Clears the head.
when I was playing planetary war craft last night,
I imagined you were Queen Zorda of Gorn.
queen Zorda?
the naked chick with the tentacles?
Yeah. - Ew.
I, uh...
did you just go all clarence thomas on me?
no, the traffic cam and the software firewall,
I thought we were having a moment.
I could so call human resources right now.
I'm--I'm sorry. It was a-- it was a misunderstanding.
I'm going to ask you a question.
think very carefully before you answer.
okay.
what was I doing with my tentacles?
if this is our future, I'm really worried.
15 kilometers, 15 miles, 15 what?
maybe it's their 15th mission.
no, it's their 10th mission.
if you call terrorism a mission.
look.
military time.
1500 hours. 3:00.
it's a quarter to three now.
we only have 15 minutes to find the location.
there is no empirical evidence to support your supposition, Michael.
it's a hunch, Kitt.
if I'm wrong, at 3: 01, I'll apologize.
Kitt, display all possible targets again.
there are three military installations within a 30-mile radius.
there are no munitions plants, no manufacturers of guidance systems, and no ordnance suppliers.
there's a cop checking us out.
he is eying you suspiciously.
roll with it.
pay up.
smells like victory.
buy yourself something nice.
I will.
Sarah, Michael, you may unlock your lips now.
the officer is leaving.
okay.
we're good. - Yeah, good.
when I was in Iraq, sometimes we'd lose a huge truck over a tiny little fuel pump relay.
so?
so maybe there's a company here that produces something small, that could affect something big.
Kitt, research.
light manufacturing only.
part suppliers for vital industries, military, energy.
anderson valve, manufacturers of check valves used in every major oil refinery in the United States.
destruction of anderson's valve making capacity will destruct the supply chain and increase the price of gasoline.
how much? - I estimate approximately $10 per gallon.
where is it? - 3. 2 miles from our current location.
anderson valve, let's go.
that's their car...
1970 super bee, 426 hemi, four barrel, four speed.
what a beaut.
only 21 were produced with the hemispherical head engine, and four-speed transmission.
you boys done?
Kitt, weapons.
each carries a 15 round magazine, and I.D. badges, compliments of Dr. Graiman.
the cameras on your identity badges are linked real time with the NSA's facial recognition database.
so we should be able to help you find Nikki and Max.
be careful.
Thanks, dad.
Kitt, open sesame.
how the hell are we supposed to find these guys?
process of elimination.
we'll alert you when facial recog finds someone who doesn't belong.
how much time?
just under two minutes.
Kitt, scan for valve making equipment.
seven different valves are produced in the building.
one minute remaining. - Copy.
Kitt, you said "check valve" earlier. - Yes, Sarah.
scan only for one-way valves.
the only equipment capable of producing a one-way valve is 30 yards to your one o'clock.
should thin the herd a bit.
Billy, my sensors have detected the presence of c-4.
Kitt sniffers detected c-4! - All right.
Sarah, there are explosives in that room.
Hey!
Oh, boy.
Mike, get out of there.
it's too late, I'm going to try to disarm it.
Michael, throw the bag into the alley.
Thoue's enough c-4 to take out half the building.
Michael, you cannot disarm it in time.
I have a plan.
Kitt! I am fine, Michael.
you may want to assist Sarah.
Nikki and Max are getting away.
Freeze!
drop it.
you drop yours.
move it another inch, and you won't have any fingers left.
it's her.
Sarah, can you hear me?
Yeah, Carrie, I got 'em.
do not shoot.
Sarah, fire if you have to.
negative, do not fire.
Nikki's congressman Childress' daughter.
bet they told you not to shoot me, didn't they?
they're idiots.
you should've shot her.
Ow! - Sorry.
you were always bad at operation when we were kids.
just good at playing doctor.
incoming call.
put it up, exterior mode.
Mike, are you okay?
why weren't we told who she was?
the information was considered "need to know."
when it results in Sarah pulling buckshot from my arm
I'd call it "need to know.
the congressman asked us to keep this quiet.
we felt obliged to honor his request.
mm, I can't believe you sent me after some spoiled brat running around with a dude and a shotgun.
what's her problem?
daddy didn't buy her a pony when she was a little girl?
actually, I bought her two.
Max has her brainwashed.
congressman.
Max teach her how to shoot, too?
Mike, please.
you must be Michael knight.
nice to finally meet you.
I'm afraid I'm to blame for my daughter's aim.
she's bagged her fair share of deer over the years.
good thing I don't have antlers.
Nicole is a sweet girl.
I may have overindulged her, and her mother leaving wasn't easy, but this is not her.
Yeah, she seems like a real angel.
that's my daughter Sarah.
she's a sweet girl too.
most of the time.
the girl was always strong-willed, but this is something else.
she went to Berkeley to get an education.
four years later, I barely recognized the girl I moved into the dormitory.
and you think Max was responsible?
he's a cancer.
he took my only child from me.
the situation seems to be similar to that of Patty Hearst.
creating a condition - we know what Stockholm syndrome is, Kitt.
Mike will find her.
and bring her back safely.
I don't want my daughter hurt, Mr.Knight.
I'd consider it a personal favor.
I'll take care of it.
thank you, Michael.
charmer, isn't he?
he's a politician, charming is his business.
he's also been very supportive of my father's experiments for years.
you mean he's knight industries' congressional sugar daddy.
Yep.
you buy it, the Patty Hearst thing?
not one bit.
she shot me with a smile on her face.
Thanks.
you're welcome.
where would you go if you were them?
an island in the South Pacific.
nice.
I have an alternate hypothesis. - Of course you do.
surveillance footage captured from anderson valve included this.
I'm not sure what I'm looking at, but it's definitely not an island in the South Pacific.
I apologize. Allow me to zoom.
and focus on the paper in his pocket.
tee Ticks?
Kitt, search for words or phrases containing those letters in that order.
I've done that.
there are more than three million possibilities.
but there is also an image in the corner of the document.
can you tell what it is?
it's too obscured for my recognition software.
but it's quite possible the shape is a corporate logo.
so now cross-check those letters with the names of corporations.
which narrows the list down to 78 worldwide.
now sort only for the U.S.
it leaves six possibilities, and only one of those has a military connection.
for many years, they were a small family-run operation.
but their business expanded rapidly due to military contracts.
what do they make? - Turbofan engines used on tomahawk missiles.
Where's their main base of operations?
it is a factory complex 134 miles from here.
that's their next target.
maybe we were wrong.
no, they'll show up eventually.
could be a couple hours.
any suggestions on how we could kill some time?
I have access to any number of games, puzzles, movies, trivia.
he wasn't talking to you, Kitt.
spin the bottle.
what are you, 12?
okay, Seven Minutes in Heaven.
it's a stakeout, Dorkus.
Sarah's completely focused.
it's a rule.
two people can't sit in a car at night and not make out.
Aww, little zoe. So naive.
a significant heat source is approaching the front side of the complex.
let's go.
Kitt, do you still have them?
Yes, they are currently attempting to breach the facility's main gate.
I'm going in. - Continue on your present path.
if you come back during the day, it might be a little easier to get in.
hi there. Remember me?
how's the arm?
get your hands up.
both of you.
Max! - Shut up!
back off! Now.
come on, Max.
we both know you're not gonna hurt her.
you don't know anything about me.
what are you doing? - Shut your mouth!
I am sick of hearing you whine.
what?
you take another step, I'll kill her.
please, help me!
Max, for future reference you may not want to grab the girl who shot me and use her as a human shield.
drop your weapons, or, once again, I'll kill her.
Mike, he's serious.
Mike. - All right.
Michael, Max is getting away.
forget him. We got what we came for.
daddy, Max made me do everything.
he told me that he was gonna kill you if I didn't help him.
Oh, sweetheart.
I'm glad you're all right.
how'd she get away?
I don't think she got away.
I think she's buying time for her boyfriend.
she knew daddy would bail her out. - Not this time.
there's a federal warrant out for her arrest.
how did you guys hack into the treasury department's mainframe?
Max did everything.
what is this place?
come on, Nicole.
we're going home.
actually, congressman, she's going to a federal detention facility.
they do the best tattoos.
that's absurd.
she was clearly being held against her will.
Alex. - I'm sorry.
there's a federal warrant.
don't say a word to anybody.
I'll call my lawyers and have them meet us.
not a word.
daddy?
is that really necessary?
not necessary, but it's the law.
wait. I need to talk to my dad.
can I just talk to him for one minute, please?
I want to talk to mom too.
can you get her on the phone?
sure, sweetheart.
do they really have to listen to this?
take your time.
20 bucks says Nikki rolls over on Max.
no way. She loves him.
Plus, he's way hot.
hot?
are we watching the same movie?
double or nothing.
you're on.
my daughter's agreed to testify against max, provide the names of everyone in his organization.
thank you.
and I'm sure the fbi will appreciate her cooperation.
well, then take off her cuffs.
I'm sorry.
it's okay, daddy. I'm ready.
take me in. - I'll go with her.
Hey.
did you see the look on Nikki's face when Carrie put the cuffs on her?
it was like her eyes almost popped out of her head.
it doesn't matter.
what do you mean?
I mean limited intel tying our hands.
come on, we were set up for failure.
Max gets away and she gets off? What's it all for?
we brought back the congressman's daughter.
mission accomplished. - Yeah, but Max is still out there.
and I don't like leaving loose ends.
I think we did the best we could given our parameters.
look, we're not the first to get sidelined by politics.
and we're not gonna be the last.
Sarah, you're a scientist.
what do you know about politics?
how do you think I got the funding for my research all these years?
look, what's done is done.
game room. Eight ball.
I'm up five games to four.
your memory's as bad as your aim.
I'm up five-four.
please, I would beat you one-handed.
agent Rivai, you thought about your future?
on a daily basis, congressman.
I can make sure that future becomes brighter than you ever imagined.
not gonna happen.
well, she's my daughter. Had to give it a shot.
Dr. Graiman, have you made any modifications to the computer system?
no. Why?
one of the firewalls is down.
that's impossible.
the system was accessed from the game room.
what's going on?
there's no way she could have logged on from here.
the system's locked.
it's still locked, but it's been breached.
has anything been downloaded?
she took it. - Who?
took what? - Nikki.
she took it all.
what exactly did she get?
four tiny little files, except it's who we are, what we do, our secret location, and our ties to the government.
if that gets on the internet...
she downloaded everything?
how? - I don't know, but she did.
alert Carrie.
Mike, find her. Fast.
I've plotted an intercept course for agent Rivai.
Kitt, attack mode.
daddy? - Yeah.
what's gonna happen to me?
don't worry. They'll take care of everything.
rivai , Nikki stole our files. - What?
she downloaded five classified files from the ssc computer.
she has everything on us.
she must've had some sort of wireless scanner.
you need to search her.
Kitt's tracking the van's GPS.
tell Carrie I'm on my way.
