on THREE, READY? ONE, TWO, THREE.
Yes!

where THERE'S A LITTLE MORE M...
Oh. RIGSBY? A LITTLE HELP HERE.
Oh, PLEASE.
looks LIKE THREE TO THE CHEST, POINT-BLANK.
perfect TRIANGLE FORMATION.
no BRASS-- LOOKS LIKE THE SHOOTER TOOK THE SHELL CASINGS WITH HIM. PRO JOB.
can't FIND ANY ID.
call FORENSICS. RUN HIM FOR PRINTS.
who IS HE? -NAME'S WILLIAM McTEER, FROM SAN FRANCISCO,
serial CHILD RAPIST, SERVED SIX YEARS AT PELICAN BAY.
and YOU KNOW THIS HOW? -I'M THE ONE WHO SENT HIM THERE.
we're NEAR MARIE'S DONUTS.
anyone WANT TO GO FOR A BEAR CLAW AFTER?
can't SAY I'M HUNGRY.
Jane, WE HAVE A CASE. YOU THINK I HAVE TIME FOR GAMES?
life IS A GAME. YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME FOR THAT. SHH.
Shh! I'M GONNA READ YOUR THOUGHTS.
I WANT YOU TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN...
and OUT.
will YOU CONCENTRATE?
name AS MANY 20th CENTURY PRESIDENTS AS YOU CAN... NOW.
uh, COOLIDGE, WILSON, ROOSEVELT...
um, EISENHOWER, TRUMAN, KENNEDY, NIXON, L. B.J. -GOOD.
take ANOTHER BREATH IN...
and OUT.
concentrate ON WHICH MUG IT IS UNDER.
I AM LISTENING TO YOUR THOUGHTS.
don't SHOUT. I CAN HEAR YOU.
open YOUR EYES.
well, YOU DID HAVE A 25% SHOT.
we COULD DO IT ALL DAY, AND I WOULD GET IT EVERY TIME.
give ME THAT. HOW'D YOU DO IT?
you TOLD ME, LISBON.
our MINDS ARE IN SYNC.
in FACT, RIGHT NOW--RIGHT NOW I'M FEELING SOMETHING...
I'm GETTING IT RIGHT HERE. IT'S A... IT'S A NICKNAME.
saint... TERESA.
look, ANOTHER ONE. LISBON WAS LIKE A ROCK STAR FOR A WHILE.
what's WITH HER HAIR?
what's WRONG WITH MY HAIR? -NOTHING.
the McTEER CASE MADE YOUR CAREER AND YOU NEVER SAID A WORD.
you're LIKE A SUPERHERO WITH A SECRET IDENTITY.
uh, YOU WANNA KNOW THE DEAL?
fine. McTEER HIT THE BAY AREA FOR 18 MONTHS.
he ATTACKED 7 GIRLS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 6 AND 9.
I WAS THE S. F.P. D. INSPECTOR WHO CAUGHT IT.
I INSPECTED--TOOK McTEER DOWN. NOW, WHAT DO YOU GOT?
B. F.S. FOUND THE SHOOTER'S GUN A BLOCK AWAY IN A TRASH BIN.
they're RUNNING IT FOR PRINTS NOW.
inspector LISBON'S ACTIONS WERE LAUDED AS HEROIC "'BY CITY OFFICIALS AND HER S. F.P. D. COLLEAGUES,'
said HER SUPERVISOR, LIEUTENANT SAMUEL BOSCO"?
inspector LISBON DID AN EXEMPLARY JOB
tracking DOWN AND ARRESTING THIS ANIMAL.
well, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. YOU SHOULD GET AN ACT TOGETHER.
can YOU DO BARBRA STREISAND? -DON'T TEMPT ME.
so I HEARD ABOUT McTEER.
weird, HUH? I MEAN, HERE WE ARE AGAIN, AFTER HOW MANY YEARS?
too MANY. HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO DREYER?
he'd BE MY FAVORITE.
Dreyer WHELAN-- FATHER OF THE LAST VICTIM,
KATY--7 YEARS OLD, PROMISED TO KILL McTEER ON RELEASE.
I CALLED HIM. HE'S ON HIS WAY DOWN FROM MARIN. -ALL RIGHT.
you're ALL OVER IT. LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANY HELP...
for OLD TIMES' SAKE. -FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.
here's McTEER'S ADDRESS. PAROLE OFFICER SAYS HE'S GOT
a LIVE-IN GIRLFRIEND. GO AND TALK TO HER. -HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND?
I THINK I'LL GO WITH HER. GOOD IDEA. -RIGSBY, CHECK UP
on McTEER'S OLD FRIENDS FROM THE PEDOPHILE WORLD,
especially THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MOVED FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SACRAMENTO. -SURE, BOSS.
Cho AND I HAVE A TRIAL MEETING WITH THE DEPUTY A. G.
not IF I THROW MYSELF INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC FIRST.
ms. DeRASK, WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH WILLIAM McTEER? -HE WAS MY FIANC?
fianc?
you HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?
Oh, SHE JUST CAN'T SEE HOW A WOMAN COULD FALL IN LOVE WITH
a CONVICTED PEDOPHILE--NOT, UH, THE BEST HUSBAND MATERIAL.
bill WAS A GOOD MAN, A GOOD PROVIDER.
and HE TREATED ME LIKE A QUEEN.
and THOSE CHARGES IN SAN FRANCISCO WERE TOTALLY BOGUS ANYWAY.
that BITCH COP HAD IT IN FOR HIM
a "VENDETTA," IS WHAT BILL CALLED IT.
you GOTTA LEARN HOW TO CLEAN THAT TRAP, TANYA
that's WHERE THE CLOG...
Hey. -HEY.
it's THE POLICE-- ABOUT BILL.
my BROTHER CAME OVER TO FIX THE SINK FOR ME.
David. -PATRICK.
Hey. -THAT'S GRACE.
David, DO YOU KNOW WILLIAM McTEER?
I MET HIM A COUPLE OF TIMES.
he TREATED TANYA GOOD, SO, YOU KNOW...
anyway, I JUST GOTTA REATTACH IT AND YOU'RE ALL SET.
nice MEETING YOU GUYS.
you, TOO.
do YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO WOULD WANT TO HARM WILLIAM?
well... IT'S PROBABLY NOTHIN',
but HE HAD A FIGHT WITH HIS BOSS LAST WEEK
came HOME ALL MOODY, SAID THE GUY WAS OUT TO GET HIM.
who's HIS BOSS? -SOME PIP-SQUEAK. I DON'T KNOW.
uh, XXXYZ INCORPORATED IS THE NAME OF THE PLACE, I THINK.
it's, UH, OVER ON WINLEY, NEAR THE HIGHWAY.
Hey, MOMMY.
Hey, EMILY, BABY. HOW WAS SCHOOL?
I CAN MULTIPLY MY SIXES.

Hi, EMILY. I PATRICK.
how ARE YOU? -GOOD.
good DAY, HUH? -MM-HMM.
six TIMES TABLES, HUH?
why DON'T YOU GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND HELP YOUR UNCLE DAVID?
it's OKAY, SWEETIE.
see YA.
I DON'T THINK McTEER TOUCHED EMILY.
see? I TOLD YOU.
because HE WAS STILL GROOMING HER.
you DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
you MET BILL AT A SHOPPING MALL, DIDN'T YOU?
near THE VIDEO ARCADE OR--OR THE MOVIE THEATER.
Emily WAS WITH YOU.
he WORKED THERE BACK THEN.
Yeah. REAL GENTLEMAN-- NOT LIKE YOUR OTHER GUYS.
he--he NEVER PRESSURED YOU TO HAVE SEX.
wasn't LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, BUT HE WAS JUST SO GOOD WITH EMILY. HE LISTENED TO HER.
nobody LISTENED TO YOU LIKE THAT, GROWING UP.
bill WANTED TO BE A FATHER.
my GIRL DOESN'T DESERVE A FATHER?
lately, HE'D BEEN ASKING IF HE COULD TAKE EMILY AWAY
on AN OVERNIGHT TRIP-- MAYBE CAMPING,
a LITTLE FATHER/DAUGHTER BONDING.
he'd BEEN PRESSURING YOU TO SAY YES, JUST A LITTLE...
but JUST ENOUGH TO START TO NAG YOU
a TINY, LITTLE SCRATCHING NAG
that MAYBE WHAT YOU FELT DEEP DOWN WAS RIGHT.
was TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
you DESERVE A GOOD MAN, TANYA.
if YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THAT FOR YOURSELF,
then JUST PRETEND-- FOR EMILY'S SAKE.
we DONE HERE? COULD--CAN-- I GOTTA EAT. I'M STARVING.
Yeah.
all RIGHT.
you EACH ARE THE STATE'S KEY WITNESSES IN A FEW CASES THIS MONTH.
agent LISBON, YOU'VE GOT HOWARD AND ENG.
agent CHO, YOU'VE GOT RINGMAN, DALY AND FREED.
freed. FREED BIT ME.
and BE SURE TO MENTION THAT ON THE STAND.
Teresa, YOU REMEMBER HOWARD?
he AND HIS SYNDICATE STOLE $100 MILLION FROM THE ONLINE ACCOUNTS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
and THEN HE STASHED THE MONEY AND KILLED HIS PARTNER?
I REMEMBER HIM. THE GUY'S CREEPY. -GUY'S GOING TO PRISON,
thanks TO AGENT LISBON AND HER COOL, CALM EXPERTISE.
that's ME-- COOL AND CALM.
so GLAD THIS ISN'T A JANE CASE.
you HAVE GOT TO TELL HIM, TERESA, THAT HE CANNOT THREATEN PEOPLE WITH BOMBS TO GET A CONFESSION.
no RUBBER MASKS, NO MONSTER SUITS-- HEY, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.
B. F.S. GOT A PRINT OFF THE GUN THAT KILLED McTEER.
and THAT'S A PROBLEM? -YEAH.
boss, THE PRINT IS YOURS.
your FINGERPRINT IS ON THE MAGAZINEOF THE MURDER WEAPON.
tell ME WHY I SHOULDN'T BE THROWING UP IN THE BATHROOM RIGHT NOW.
it's A LAB ERROR. IT MUST BE.
they're OVERWORKED AND UNDERFUNDED.
this HAPPENED LAST YEAR WITH THE L. A.P. D.
just HAVE THEM RETEST IT.
come ON! YOU DON'T THINK I DID THIS.
what I THINK IS, I'M UP TO MY ASTERISK IN POLITICAL QUICKSAND.
you AND YOUR TEAM ARE OFF THE McTEER CASE, OBVIOUSLY.
I UNDERSTAND. ARE WE THROWING IT TO THE FBI?
no.
Hey, LISBON. HOW ABOUT THIS, HUH?
Bosco. -HE KNOWS AS MUCH ABOUT THE McTEER CASE AS YOU DO.
it MAKES SENSE.
and, YES, I HAD TO PULL SOME STRINGS.
thank YOU. I... GUESS.
no, NO, DON'T-- DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME.
if YOU'RE GUILTY, I WANT YOU NAILED.
I JUST DON'T WANT THE FEEBS STROLLING AROUND MY OFFICES,
asking IMPERTINENT QUESTIONS. -OKAY.
so YOU UNDERSTAND, I HAVE TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS NOW?
nothing PERSONAL. -ABSOLUTELY. SHOOT.
Hey, EVERYBODY.
uh, WELL, I BET YOU WISH YOU WORE SOME GLOVES, HUH?
so YOU HAVE SOME INPUT HERE? -NO. JUST NOSY.
it's OKAY. HE CAN STAY IF HE WANTS TO. -I'LL STAY.
where WERE YOU TUESDAY NIGHT?
I WAS AT HOME, WATCHING TELEVISION.
nobody SAW ME.
What'd YOU WATCH? -SOME REALITY SHOW.
which?
cooking SHOW, WITH A MAN.
Oh, YEAH. THAT ONE.
the ANGRY MAN. -YEAH. OH, I KNOW THE ONE. THAT'S GOOD.
cooking SHOW. TUESDAY NIGHTS.
Yeah. -ANGRY MAN.
so I CAN, UH, SET UP A TIME FOR YOU TO TAKE A POLYGRAPH.
no.
I DIDN'T KILL McTEER.
nobody SAID YOU DID YET.
yet?
what THE...
good LUCK WITH THE CASE.
having LUNCH?
a DISCUSSION-- ABOUT LISBON'S SITUATION.
okay, CHO, YOU SAY WORK THE McTEER CASE HARD,
screw BOSCO AND MINELLI, YOU DISAGREE,
and YOU'RE NOT SO SURE. I'M JUST SAYING, MAYBE WE SHOULD
let BOSCO DO HIS JOB, STAY OUT OF HIS WAY. HE'S A GOOD COP.
is ANYBODY GONNA GO AS HARD AFTER THIS CASE AS US?
I DON'T THINK SO.
well, YOU'RE ASSUMING LISBON DIDN'T KILL HIM.
what IF SHE DID KILL HIM? WHAT WLD YOU DO?
what WOULD YOU DO?
me? I'D WALK AWAY. BUT I AIN'T THE LAW.
Yes, WE WALK AWAY.
Yeah. -I DISAGREE.
McTEER WENT AFTER LITTLE CHILDREN.
Hey, MAYBE HE DESERVED TO DIE. IF LISBON HAS THE GUTS TO KILL HIM, SHE HAS THE GUTS TO SERVE HER TIME FOR IT.
I'm GONNA TALK TO McTEER'S BOSS. -I'LL COME WITH YOU.
okay, OKAY. LOOK, LISBON DIDN'T DO IT ANYHOW.
I MEAN, RIGHT? SHE'S NOT CAPABLE OF THAT.
I'm NOT SO SURE.
what's UP THAT WE COULDN'T TALK INSIDE? I'M BUSY.
thought YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE OUTSIDE SO YOU COULD EXPRESS YOUR ANGER WITHOUT CONSTRAINT. -WHY?
I KNOW YOU LIED ABOUT THE ALIBI.
I DIDN'T LIE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID ON TUESDAY NIGHT,
but YOU WEREN'T WATCHING TV. -I DIDN'T LIE. HE MADE RISOTTO.
now THIS IS INSULTING. YOU GONNA CONTINUE LYING TO ME?
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I DID ON TUESDAY NIGHT. IT'S WEIRD.
thank YOU. AND IT'S OKAY. THE MEMORY'S THERE.
we CAN GET IT BACK. IF I PUT YOU IN A LIGHT TRANCE
like THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. STOP TRYING TO HYPNOTIZE ME.
what IF SOMETHING TRAUMATIC HAPPENED
and YOU'RE BLOCKING IT OUT?
I DIDN'T KILL McTEER.
well, LET ME HYPNOTIZE YOU SO WE CAN BE SURE. -NO.
why NOT? -'CAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU INSIDE MY HEAD.
so IT TURNS OUT YOU'RE NOT QUITE DONE WITH THE McTEER CASE.
funny. -IT'S NOT MY CHOICE.
he'll ONLY TALK TO YOU.
agent LISBON. -HELLO, DREYER.
thanks FOR COMING IN AND HELPING US OUT, MR. WHELAN.
so, YOU GUYS ARE STILL WORKING TOGETHER?
still A TEAM?
we're BOTH HANDLING THIS INTERVIEW
at YOUR REQUEST, DREYER.
we JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU.
just ONE, IN FACT. DID YOU KILL WILLIAM McTEER?
I DIDN'T.
glad TO HEAR IT. HOW'S KATY DOING?
she's WELL.
doing WELL.
healing BETTER THAN I AM, ACCORDING TO OUR THERAPIST.
where WERE YOU TUESDAY NIGHT?
at HOME, ALONE.
katy SPENT THE NIGHT AT A FRIEND'S. -AND WHAT TIME
you LET HIM HURT HER. -EXCUSE ME?
I RECENTLY READ THE INCIDENT FILES.
the INTERNAL S. F.P. D. FILES? HOW'D YOU GET AHOLD OF THOSE?
you COULD'VE TAKEN McTEER DOWN THE FRIDAY BEFORE-- A WHOLE WEEK EARLIER.
that WAS NOT THE CASE. I DIDN'T HAVE IT.
I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO NAIL HIM ON. AND IN THE MEANTIME,
and YOU COULD'VE SAVED HER. -IF I'D ARRESTED HIM ON A HUNCH,
he WOULD HAVE BEEN ACQUITTED. HE WOULD HAVE WALKED. -BUT KATY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN RAPED.
and THAT IS YOUR FAULT.
Mr. WHELAN. -WHAT?
you SWORE YOU'D SPEND YOUR ENTIRE FORTUNE IN THE SERVICE OF KILLING WILLIAM McTEER. WHY DIDN'T YOU? -I COULDN'T.
what IF I'D BEEN CAUGHT?
I COULDN'T LEAVE KATY ALONE.
my TAKE? MAYBE YOU JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS.
go TO HELL. BOTH OF YOU.
don't WORRY. HE'S ANGRY.
anger TURNS YOU.
Yes, IT DOES.
I WANT TO TAKE THE POLYGRAPH.
okay, RAISE YOUR HANDS.
how LONG DID McTEER WORK FOR YOU?
uh, COUPLE MONTHS. -HIS RECORD DIDN'T BOTHER YOU?
Nah, FREAKS WORK HARDER, YOU KNOW?
they're GRATEFUL FOR THE GIG, YOU KNOW?
not McTEER, THOUGH.
is THAT WHY YOU TWO GOT IN A FIGHT?
me AND HIM? NO. WE DIDN'T GET IN A FIGHT.
he GOT IN A FIGHT WITH HIS JACKHOLE BUDDY, DOG.
they GOT IN A FIGHT RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLACE
busted IT ALL UP, SO I FIRED HIS TWISTED ASS.
I MEAN, THAT'S MANAGEMENT 101, YOU KNOW--NO FISTFIGHTS,
so I BOOTED HIM. -HE COME BACK AT YOU ABOUT THAT?
no. HE KNOWS BETTER THAN THAT. HE KNOWS I'M CONNECTED.
connected, REALLY? TO WHOM?
uh... PEOPLE?
so WHAT WAS IT ABOUT? McTEER'S FIGHT WITH DOG? -I DON'T KNOW.
could've BEEN ABOUT A MILLION THINGS, YOU KNOW?
dog WAS A UTILITY IDIOT. HE'S DUMB IN TEN DIFFERENT WAYS.
dog" HAVE A REAL NAME?

my FATHER USED TO HAVE BLACKOUTS WHEN HE DRANK.
one TIME, HE BEAT MY BROTHER HALF TO DEATH,
and HE DIDN'T REMEMBER A THING.
the WHOLE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL, HE COULDN'T BELIEVE
it WAS HIM WHO DID IT.
are YOU DRINKING?
is THAT WHY YOU'RE TALKING OF BLACKOUTS?
what I NEED TO KNOW IS, IS--IS IT POSSIBLE
that I KILLED McTEER AND BLOTTED IT OUT?
you CAN'T REMEMBER THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER?
well, DON'T PANIC. THERE COULD BE LOTS OF REASONS
stress OR-- COPS CAN BECOME KILLERS, DOCTOR.
it CAN HAPPEN. -IT'S RIDICULOUS.
you DIDN'T EVEN KNOW McTEER WAS IN SACRAMENTO.
his PAROLE OFFICER CALLED ME LAST MONTH

killing A SPIDER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
you're INTERFERING WITH MY CASE. YOU'RE TALKING TO WITNESSES.
you're WRONG.
you GONNA LIE TO ME NOW? -WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
drop THE McTEER CASE, OR YOU'LL BE ON GUARD DUTY AT THE STATE CAPITAL, SALUTING TOURISTS.
is THAT RIGHT?
Yes, IT IS.
nice COMEBACK. -YOU TOLD HIM.
he KNOWS THE SCORE.
may I?
Thanks. MY GUY AT PELICAN BAY CAME THROUGH.
McTEER HAD A CELLMATE FOR TWO YEARS...
nicknamed "DOG.
Hey, WE KNOW THIS GUY.
that's THE BROTHER OF McTEER'S GIRLFRIEND--DAVID CHARLES.
it's KIND OF A MESS.
not AT ALL.
it's NICE.
I LIKE THOSE PICTURES.
those ARE MOSTLY FROM THE LAST TENANTS.
uh, WHERE-- WHERE ARE WE GONNA DO THIS?
Ah, INTERESTING.
let's JUST DO IT. LET--LET'S GO.
no.
no?
no, I'M NOT GONNA HYPNOTIZE YOU, LISBON.
you're-- YOU'RE TOO STRESSED. -ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
no, IT'S OKAY, SHH. IT'S OKAY, ALL RIGHT?
I'd HAVE TO MAKE ALL THE STRESS LEAVE YOUR BODY,
maybe HAVE YOU COUNT DOWN FROM 100, 99, 98
we'd GO ROUND AND ROUND
94, 93... LISTEN TO ME, LISBON.
all THE STRESS WOULD HAVE TO MELT AWAY.
you'd HAVE TO FEEL CALM AND RELAXED AND VERY SAFE.
it's JUST ABOUT IMPOSSIBLE. I'M NOT HYPNOTIZING YOU, LISBON.
it's NOT GONNA HAPPEN, SO YOU CAN JUST RELAX.
you ARE NOT FALLING INTO A DEEP, RELAXING TRANCE STATE.
sleep.
okay. GOOD.
all RIGHT.
so YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE STEPS...
relaxing WITH EACH STEP...
and NOW YOU REACH THE BOTTOM...
the VERY LAST STEP.
the ULTIMATE PLACE OF CALM.
how ARE YOU FEELING?
good.
good.
you're GONNA REMAIN IN THIS RELAXED TRANCE STATE WHILE WE THINK ABOUT TUESDAY NIGHT.
but FIRST...
sometimes YOU DANCE TO THAT SPICE GIS CD, DON'T YOU?
Yeah.
I THOUGHT SO.
now, TUESDAY.
you CAN WATCH THE WHOLE DAY LIKE IT'S A MOVIE.
every DETAIL IS IN FOCUS.
you CAN ZOOM INTO ANY MOMENT YOU WANT.
you CAN FAST-FORWARD, REWIND.
you ARE IN TOTAL CONTROL, OKAY?
okay.
good.
what DO YOU SEE?
I'm FINISHING UP THE FORM 41s ON THE MILBANK CASE.
I FEEL...
hungry, 'CAUSE I SKIPPED LUNCH.
the NEW GUY IN THE MAILROOM IS HOT.
is HE?
Yeah.
let's FAST-FORWARD A LITTLE.
later IN THE DAY...
you're ABOUT TO LEAVE C. B.I.
van PELT'S WORKING LATE. SHE'S A HARD WORKER.
she MIGHT DO WELL IF SHE MANAGES NOT TO SLEEP WITH RIGSBY.
where DO YOU GO NOW?
I...
H-HOME?
do YOU?
WHERE--WHERE--WHERE DO YOU GO, LISBON?
I'm IN MY CAR.
it's LOW ON GAS.
it's OKAY. YOU'RE IN A TRANCE STATE.
everything IS OKAY.
I CAN'T
what DO YOU SEE?
where DO YOU GO?
I... I DON'T... IT'S BLANK.
I JUST SEE A BLANK SCREEN. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
it's ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I WENT. I-I-I CAN'T REMEMBER.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I WENT.
it's OKAY. IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
that's A LITTLE WEIRD.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE BEST.
I WANT MY MONEY BACK.
hmm. YEAH.
why CAN'T I REMEMBER?
it's INTERESTING, ISN'T IT?
Yeah.
Yeah, IT'S INTERESTING.
well, YOU KNOW, TH-THANKS FOR TRYING.
you PROBABLY HAVE, UH, SOMEWHERE YOU NEED TO GO, RIGHT?
well, I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP THAT EASILY.
I CAN COUNT ON YOU NOT TO TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THIS, RIGHT?
on THE TEAM? OH, LISBON, COME ON.
Hey. JANE, I JUST NEED YOU TO LEAVE, OKAY?
all RIGHT. -COULD YOU PLEASE GO?
it's--it's GONNA BE OKAY. IT'S GONNA BE FINE, ALL RIGHT?
I PROMISE.
okay? -MM-HMM.
Tanya? I GOT YOUR TEXT.
it SAID "9-1-1." WHAT'S GOING ON?
Oh! HEY, HELP, POLICE!
relax, BUDDY.
Yeah, WE'RE CLEAR. YOU GOOD?
Yeah.
you FOUGHT WITH McTEER IN THE PARKING LOT.
he BEAT THE SNOT OUT OF YOU. -THAT MUST'VE BEEN PRETTY HUMILIATING.
so YOU LURED HIM INTO THE ALLEY AND YOU KILLED HIM. -NO, I DIDN'T KILL HIM. I DIDN'T!
you DID KILL HIM, DAVID. YOU KILLED HIM,
but IT'S OUR FRIEND ON THE HOOK R IT.
look, DOG, JAIL IS GONNA BE SO MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT YOU GET IF YOU KEEP LYING TO US. -LOOK, YOUR FRIEND, THE COP...
she's THE ONE WHO PAID ME TO BRING McTEER TO THE ALLEY.
look, I HAD NO IDEA SHE WAS GONNA SHOOT HIM, I SWEAR TO YOU.
I NEVER WOULD'VE TAKEN THE MONEY IF I KNEW IT. -AGENT LISBON
she's THE ONE WHO PAID YOU? -YEAH, I MEAN, IT HAD TO BE HER, DIDN'T IT?
I HEARD YOU GUYS ALREADY ARRESTED HER FOR IT. BUT YOU'RE GUESSING, RIGHT? YOU NEVER ACTUALLY SAW HER.
well, I DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY. IT WAS ALL TEXT.
I HEARD THOSE SHOTS. I STARTED RUNNING LIKE HELL, MAN.
and THE NEXT DAY, THERE'S 10 GRAND IN MY CHECKING ACCOUNT.
10 GRAND?
10 GRAND, SAM. -I HEARD.
10 GRAND JUST TO LURE THE VIC IN, NOT EVEN KILL HIM.
this IS SOMEBODY WITH RESOURCES, CONNECTIONS. -SOMEONE WHO'S NOT LISBON.
seriously, WHERE'S SHE GONNA GET 10 GRAND FROM?
no OFFENSE, BOSS. -I WILL HAVE VAN PELT TRACK THE TEXT.
Cho AND I WILL TALK TO THE GUY'S BANK. -LISBON,
get THIS THROUGH YOUR HEAD. YOU'RE RELIEVED OF DUTY.
you're NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE BUILDING, AND YOU TWO CLOWNS ARE WAY OUT OF HAND.
let ME DEAL WITH THIS. COME HERE.
Lisbon, LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME.
I'll HANDLE IT. WILL YOU PLEASE TRUST ME?
I'm SORRY. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
later, YOU WILL.
what ARE--ARE--ARE YOU MEDICATED OR SOMETHING?
okay, I'M ALL RIGHT. I'M FINE!
what THE HELL IS EVERYBODY LOOKING AT?! I'M FINE!
just STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM ME! I'M DONE WITH THIS CRAP!
I AM DONE! I'M SICK OF THIS CRAP!
what WAS THAT--LISBON?
she's FREAKING OUT. -OH, COME ON.
she's A LITTLE STRESSED. -WHAT IS GOING ON?
sorry.
why IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME? -IT'S ALL RIGHT.
let's--let's GO HOME. -I'LL TAKE HER.
no. LEAVE ME ALONE.
the 10 GRAND PAID TO DAVID CHARLESCAME FROM AN ACCOUNT OWNED BY A SHELL COMPANY IN THE CAYMANS.
well, THAT'S GOOD. -THE DAY AFTER IT PAID DAVID,
the ACCOUNT PAID OUT A MILLION DOLLARS TO SOMEONE ELSE.- I BET THAT'S FOR THE SHOOTER. CAN WE TRACE THE PAYMENT?
I'm TRYING, BUT-- YOU'LL FIND IT DEAD-ENDS
in A BLIND ACCOUNT THAT WAS CLOSED YESTERDAY.
okay. WE ARE WORKING THE CASE. WE JUST WANT TO
forget ABOUT IT. -HOW'S LISBON?
she's FINE.
she's FINE. WELL, WHAT DID SHE SAY, EXACTLY?
uh, I DIDN'T ACTUALLY TALK TO HER.
she--she WOULDN'T LET ME IN.
you're WORRIED ABOUT HER.
you THINK SHE MIGHT DO SOMETHING STUPID?
suicide? NO.
if SHE DID, SHE WOULDN'T BLAME THE BUREAU.
that's NOT MY CONCERN AT ALL.
I SHOULD'VE TAKEN HER OFF-DUTY WEAPON.
Oh, I'M SURE SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
Minelli ASKED ME TO DROP BY.
well, ORDERED ME TO DROP BY, ACTUALLY.
can WE TALK?
he's WORRIED ABOUT YOU. WE ALL ARE.
cause I HAD A MELTDOWN,
got PERP-WALKED OUT OF THE CBI
or BECAUSE I KILLED A GUY?
wh-- YOU KILLED McTEER?
how THE HELL WOULD I KNOW? MAYBE?
Teresa, YOU--YOU WANNA PUT AWAY YOUR GLOCK THERE?
very GOOD EYE, DOCTOR.
the GLOCK 9-MILLIMETER.
the SAFETY'S IN THE TRIGGER. HOW STUPID IS THAT?
I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF LIKE NOT HAVING A SAFETY AT ALL.
how ABOUT YOU GIVE IT TO ME?
don't LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.
don't LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. THIS IS YOUR FAULT.
Oh, WHOA, TERESA.
you UNLOCKED TOO MANY THINGS IN MY HEAD,
and NOW I CAN'T REMEMBER.
my HEAD IS MESSED UP, AND IT'S YOUR FAULT.
Teresa... PUT IT DOWN.
you NEED TO BE CALM...
and PUT DOWN THE GUN.
calm?
you WERE RIGHT, DOCTOR.
there WAS SOMETHING I WANTED TO TELL YOU.
I ACT CALM ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT ON THE INSIDE,
I'm SO ANGRY, SOMETIMES I THINK I'M GONNA EXPLODE.
all THE MISERY AND THE PAIN THAT I SEE EVERY DAY
makes ME WANNA SCREAM, BUT I LOCK IT DOWN.
I LOCK IT DOWN BECAUSE I HAVE TO BE CALM AND RATIONAL,
because THAT'S MY JOB, BUT I WANNA PULL THIS TRIGGER.
I WANNA KILL.
you're ANGRY. I HEAR THAT.
I THINK I DID IT.
I THINK I KILLED McTEER.
Oh, SHH, TERESA.
if YOU DID IT, THAT'S OKAY.
he WAS A BAD MAN.
no REASON FOR YOU TO HURT ANYONE ELSE...
or YOURSELEL
I STILL CAN'T REMEMBER. -YOU CAN AND YOU WILL. AND WHEN YOU DO, TERESA,
when YOU RUSH THROUGH TO THE TRUTH,
all THIS WEIGHT AND WORRY WILL COME OFF YOUR SHOULDERS.
okay.
I WANT YOU TO VISUALIZE THAT SCENE FOR ME.
relive THAT MOMENT.
you WENT INTO THE ALLEY...
after THIS TERRIBLE MAN.
can YOU SEE HIM?
no.
well, YES. YEAH, M-MAYBE.
Yes. YOU SEE HIM.
you SEE THE DUMPSTERS AND THE TRASH
and THE CRUMBLY OLD BRICK, AND YOU SEE McTEER. -YES.
you SEE THERE THIS--THIS MONSTER WHO DESTROYED SO MANY LIVES.
it's TOO MUCH.
see IT, TERESA.
live IT
the REEK, THE GARBAGE, THE FILTHY ALLEY WALLS, THE FADED CROSS THERE.
God MIGHT HAVE MERCY ON WILLIAM McTEER,
but YOU SURE AS HELL WOULDN'T.
he DESERVED TO DIE.
but YOU'RE STILL A GOOD PERSON, TERESA.
you CAN GET THROUGH THIS.
the CROSS?
uh, WHAT?
the CROSS, ROY.
how DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE CROSS?
it WAS INSIDE THE DOOR. ONLY THE KILLER SAW IT.
well, TERESA, YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THE CRIME SCENE.
no, I DIDN'T.
Oh, BEAUTIFULLY DONE.
lovely WORK, LISBON.
what ARE YOU...
of COURSE--THE CROSS.
you COULDN'T RESIST THE IMAGERY, COULD YOU, DOC?
lapsed CATHOLIC, PERHAPS? WHAT'S GOING ON?
surrender, DOROTHY. WE GOT YOU. BRILLIANT, THOUGH.
made LISBON COME BACK WEEK AFTER WEEK
so YOU GET HER FINGERPRINTS OFF HER COFFEE MUG AND DOSE HER UP WITH, UH, LORAZEPAM?
double DOSE FOR TUESDAY TO CAUSE THE MEMORY LOSS
memory LOSS YOU KNEW LISBON WOULD CONCEAL,
which MADE HER FAIL THE POLYGRAPH.
quite THE, UH, STUDENT OF HUMAN NATURE, HUH, DOCTOR?
well DONE, REALLY.
your BREAKDOWN IN CBI-- THAT WAS FAKE?
and HOW GOOD WAS THAT, HUH? WHAT ABOUT THAT?
after THAT, ALL I HAD TO DO WAS GET MINELLI TO GET YOU TO COME AROUND HERE.
I've BEEN WAITING FOR YOU ALL NIGHT. -THERE WAS ONE LITTLE THING...
I'm--I'm JUST-- JUST ONE LITTLE THING.
the LORAZEPAM? MAYBE THAT WENT A LITTLE TOO FAR.
when--when LISBON COULDN'T REMEMBER THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER
even UNDER HYPNOSIS, I KNEW SHE'D BEEN DRUGGED.
the REST OF IT? SPOT ON.
very, VERY IMPRESSIVE.
Thanks.
not AT ALL.
you're UNDER ARREST. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
anything YOU SAY OR DO CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN COURT.
you HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY.
so THIS GUY WHO GAVE YOU THE MILLION BUCKS
you EVER MET HIM FACE-TO-FACE? -YOU WANT HIM?
I WANT A DEAL--A GOOD ONE. WHAT I GOT, IT'S WORTH IT.
two TO FIVE, MINIMUM SECURITY.
Oh, THERE WON'T BE A DEAL. WE KNOW WHO HE IS.
just CURIOUS IF YOU KNEW.
it TOOK US A WHILE,
but WE TRACED THE SHELL COMPANY BACK TO YOU, HOWARD.
you PAID DR. CARMEN AND DAVID CHARLES TO FRAME LISBON FOR McTEER'S MURDER.
these CASH TRANSACTIONS PROVE IT.
discrediting A COP IS SO MUCH SMARTER THAN KILLING HER.
we'd HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THAT.
but THIS WAY, HER TESTIMONY DIES ALONG WITH HER CAREER.
how ABOUT YOU GIVE US A STATEMENT?
maybe HELP YOURSELF?
how ABOUT YOU KISS ME?
you're PRETTY.
so ARE YOU, COMPARED TO MOST STATE PRISON INMATES.
I HEAR MINELLI'S BILLING YOU FOR THE GLASS.
it's ONLY FAIR.
you KNOW, FOR A COP, YOU MADE A VERY CONVINCING LUNATIC.
Jane MUST BE PROUD.
maybe IT'S NOT GOOD POLICE WORK,
but I HAVE TO CONFESS, I ENJOYED IT.
letting LOOSE FOR ONCE?
look, I'M GLAD YOU GOT CLEARED.
I'm SORRY THAT WE COULDN'T LET YOU IN ON THE PLAN.
you COULD HAVE, BUT YOU DIDN'T.
you SHOULD KNOW THAT IF IT TURNED OUT TO BE YOU...
I KNOW. -JUST SO YOU DO.
enough SAID.
I'm NOT INTERRUPTING ANYTHING, AM I?
no. NIGHT, LISBON.
night, SAM.
doughnuts FROM MARIE'S. OH.
I DIDN'T SEE IT. OF COURSE.
what?
he's IN LOVE WITH YOU. -DON'T BE SILLY.
I KNOW, HARD TO FATHOM, BUT, UH,
there's NO ACCOUNTING FOR TASTE, IS THERE?
hush!
Oh, it's lovely.
it's a crime scene. - It's a lovely crime scene.
couple joggers found our john doe on their morning run.
body's still pretty fresh, so it must've happened last night.
no signs of an entry or exit wound means cause was probably a blunt force trauma to the head.
and they brought in the grown-ups because they couldn't decide whose sandbox it was?
right. Body's right on the city line.
the only thing they can agree on is that it was a carjacking gone wrong.
wallet, watch, wedding band-everything gone.
Oh, not everything.
killer would have been very frustrated to not be able to take this.
looks like a wheel. - Motorcycle wheel.
I don't buy it as a carjacking.
maybe the murderer was covering it up as one, but if you're after someone's car and valuables, you grab and bolt.
you don't waste time taking off a cuff link.
right. Carjacking-a gunshot or a stab wound is more likely than a beating.
beating like this takes time. The murder was personal.
no surprise there. The haircut, the suit, the cologne-this man had enemies.
his cologne tells you he had enemies? - Sure.
okay, confrontational.
finishing touch on a wardrobe that says, "Pay attention. Show respect.
this was an extrovert tough guy, a professional, a backroom politician or a lawyer, a fixer, the type that's good with people, making people do things they maybe don't want to do.
uh, what he is, is useless until we know who he is.
well, I can do that, too.
Oh, no, Jane. I, uh, I checked. The phone's not on him.
the signal light's still on. Phone's in range.
his assailant probably threw it in the trees.
what are you doing? - I'm making a call.
but you don't have the phone. - I have my voice.
you still need the phone. Want to use the voice activation?
you need its names and numbers.
there is one name programmed into every phone, particularly into one belonging to a middle-aged man that was wearing a wedding band.
home.
Hello? - Hello.
this is Patrick Jane from the California bureau of investigation.
I was wondering if you knew a man 6-feet tall, mid 40s, salt and pepper hair, gray custom-made suit, weighing about 192, give or take?
that's my husband Gordon Hodge. - Gordon Hodge, hmm.
you said you're from CBI? Is something wrong?
uh, just a sec. It's for you.
Hello?
I knew something like this would happen, sooner or later.
well, was your husband having some sort of trouble lately?
gordon was a criminal attorney with a very special practice.
he had only one client-the sinner saints.
bikers, are they?
Yeah, they're one of the top biker gangs in the state.
they run some legit businesses, but mostly they're into drugs and prostitution, low-rent protection rackets, that kind of thing.
for years, I begged him to get out, but Gordon said that a lawyer never abandons his client.
it's unethical.
it's what he always called them- never "the gang," always "the client."
when was the last time you saw him?
yesterday morning, before work.
gordon used to meet these people at all hours- that's how they are.
so we didn't get worried when he didn't come home last night.
had he been acting differently lately?
he'd been more on edge the last week or so.
I think something happened at work, but I'm not sure what.
did you ask him about it? - No, never.
work was off-limits.
he said it was boring.
what was the real reason?
do you think he was ashamed, or he sensed your shame?
he wanted to protect us.
would his colleagues at the office have known what was going on?
he was a one-man shop. Didn't even have a secretary.
gordon didn't trust anyone with his business.
any idea who might have wanted to kill him?
well, you might want to ask his client.
he knew all their secrets.
he probably learned something that he shouldn't have.
either of you ever meet any of those scumbags?
no.
you two must be very torn.
living in such a beautiful home, driving nice cars, going to good schools, all paid for by dangerous criminals, or, uh, "scumbags," as my colleague says.
do I wish that Gordon would've defended civil rights leaders? Yes, of course!
but he believed that everyone had a constitutional right to have a good defense.
he had his principles.
thank you for your time.
did you go to some interview school I've never heard of?
next time, get the facts, save the editorial. - Yes, ma'am.
I know. Jane did it, too. He's not a CBI agent.
from you, I expect professional standards. - Yes, boss.
that was the captain of the local C.H.I.P.S.
Hodge's car was just fished out of a lake about a mile from the murder scene,
no good for prints.
he said that two weeks back, they busted Hodge at a highway rest stop, walking to his car with 2 ounces of coke and 2 ounces of meth in his pockets.
nailed him with felony possession... - Nice.
only the D.A.dropped the charges.
there was some unlawful search technicality.
either Hodge is a great lawyer...
or the D. A.turned him in exchange for dropping the charges,
planned to use him as an informant.
well, if the saints found out- yeah, they'd kill him.
they did know about the charges. Their boss, Von Mcbride, posted Hodge's bail.
well, talk to your friends at the D. A. find out what the story is there.
Jane and I will go talk to the sinner saints.
okay, be careful. - You want me to come for backup?
uh, no. Talk to forensics about the car. Jane, let's go.
now, please? Come on.
beautiful, huh? - No, not really.
I fail to see the charm.
it's the glamour of mobility.
that's why the girls went for Cain and not Abel.
is that right? - Yeah.
Nomads- sexier than farmers. They have romance.
I spoke to my friend in the D. A.'s office.
they didn't make a deal with Hodge.
they let him go 'cause the case was less than ironclad, and they've already lost too many to Hodge and the saints.
last 10 years, they've beaten the rap in over 50 cases,
murder, rape, drug-trafficking. They're bulletproof.
nobody's bulletproof.
well, my friend says to stay away from them, that they're bad news.
good, sound lawyerly advice. I'll take that under advisement.
you ready?
there's romance for you.
we're with the CBI. We're looking for Von Mcbride.
not here, which is where you need to be.
well, can you tell us where he is?
no. I cannot.
listen, we're here for information, not trouble, boys.
well, we've got nothing to say.
I can take you in if you want me to. I prefer to talk here.
like I said, there's nothing to talk about.
we're not doing anything illegal.
Mr. Mcbride?
your focus on this pressing matter suggests you're the man in charge here.
Yeah, well, keep on walking, blondie.
we just have a few questions for you. It won't take long.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
I don't, uh, talk to police officers on the advice of my lawyer.
your lawyer's dead.
Yeah, I heard that. But his advice is still good.
means your business here is done.
you don't want to know who the informant is, then?
what informant? - Oh, I'm sorry. Forget I spoke. Oh, I'm so sorry.
you messing with me? - Yeah, I'm messing with you. There's no informant.
come here.
you touch him, and I'll arrest you.
I would love to see you try and do that.
what's your name?
Xander. - Xander, your threats are empty.
she's a state agent. You're not gonna lay a finger on her, and you know that, so why play tough? W-where's that come from, this need to intimidate?
I'm a sadist, and I bore easily.
me, I see a difficult childhood- bad parenting, a lot of torment.
but I also see how that suffering gave you great powers of empathy and a strong creative side, and those are the qualities you should try and nurture in yourself.
not this brutish character you try to hide behind.
Oh, that's Xander, all right.
full of empathy.
you guys want a drink? - Sure.
so what's this crap about an informant?
how long have you know about Hodge's taste for coke and meth?
couple years.
guy liked to party, but he could still do his job.
couldn't have been too thrilled when he got busted.
case got dropped.
must've wondered why.
illegal search. - Yeah.
either that or Hodge, uh, flipped on you.
that son of a...
hold on a second, diamond. He didn't flip.
there is no informant.
where were you last night? - Right here.
and I got 30 other brothers who will vouch for me and each other.
look, man, none of my guys did this.
we loved Gordon, man. He was like a member of the club.
you know, he couldn't ride worth a damn. - No, he couldn't, huh? He tried, though.
who killed him? - My guess?
probably some other motorcycle club looking to put us out of business,
chaos Brigade, Bolos Plata.
get your hands off of me! Get off me! Help!
get your hands off of me! Get off of me!
get off of me! - Let her go, and back away! Back away now!
you're murderers! All of you!
ma'am, take it easy. I'm CBI. Ma'am!
who was that? She a friend of yours?
never seen her before.
mentally deranged, seems like. Poor thing.
you know, you're a very good liar.
most people subconsciously signal dishonesty, but you? There's nothing.
no inner conflict.
usually, that's the mark of what shrinks like to call a "sociopath."
well, if by "sociopath," you mean that if you cross me,
I would enjoy watching you suffer pain before I kill you...
then, yeah, I'm a sociopath.
see ya.
Bye.
so we talked to the gang unit.
there's no other biker gang would cross the saints and run the risk of starting a war that they couldn't win.
this is incredible. You should see this.
hold on. Anything on the woman in the parking lot?
sinner saints have their own web site.
Really? - Yeah.
we cross-checked registrations of the truck model and color with driver's license photos fitting her description. No hits.
truck must be registered to her husband or other family member.
McBride's clamming up about her means he's hiding something.
he's merged two other gangs into the saints in the last five years.
it's the fastest growing gang in the nation.
go to Hodge's office. See if you can find anything on the gang's operation that pops.
and have the Deerfield P.D.issue a bolo on the woman's pickup truck.
okay. - You can buy logo merchandise,
sinner saints coffee mugs, decals, beach towels.
and some various other interesting little knickknacks.
nice. - Yeah.
well, if they do it, we should do it. A range of casual wear, maybe?
sensible shoes?
I'll get right on that.
lisbon loafers.
found something, boss.
these are Gordon Godge's cell phone calls from the night of the murder.
all were routine business calls-Von Mcbride, other lawyers, court officials.
but it's the last call that bumps.
7: 23, incoming from a Constance Hoyt, current address unknown.
must not want people finding her.
well, I went back three months- a lot of calls between her and Hodge.
did you try the number? - Twice.
got one of those computer voice mail messages.
Plus, I ran her name through the D.M.V. for registration of a black pickup truck.
she's not your parking lot woman.
check Von Mcbride's cell phone records.
see if he had any contact with this Constance Hoyt.
bingo. Couple of chatty cathys.
talking three or four times a day.
either she's his mom, or... - His girlfriend.
we just have a couple questions for you.
I'll drive! - No time!
boss, seat belt. - Go!
bike's got too much muscle. You're gonna have to...
I gotta get you out of the office more.
got Hodge's office key?
so what's your problem with bikers?
I hate bikers. - Why's that?
my dad was a biker. - Really? I didn't know that.
no? I thought you read my file.
well, it says he was a big-time criminal. Didn't specify any affiliations.
Jimmy marks on the doorknob.
doubt that was part of the original decor.
door clear. - Clear.
desk clear.
cracks are on the outside of the window.
means a previous break-in attempt.
think they were looking for something, or just trying to send a message?
message was definitely a part of it.
do you prefer "Constance," or "diamond"?
I prefer to get the hell out of here.
you ran from the police, endangered the lives of two agents.
you could be here a couple of days.
I don't think that's right. - Why'd you run?
I ran because I'm dead if anyone sees me talking to cops.
the saints are all paranoid about informants now, which is why I'm not saying a word.
tell us about your affair with Gordon Hodge.
I wasn't sleeping with Gordon.
Yes, you were.
it was only a few months. We were just having fun.
it's not like Von doesn't sleep around on me and...
gordon treated me nice.
you had genuine feelings for him.
he was decent. He never looked down on you.
just got sucked in too deep with the saints.
did you know he was arrested for possession?
told him a hundred times to be careful, but he got dumb about it.
Ah, well, drugs simply make people careless.
you had to be a little concerned about Mcbride finding out.
it would've made things complicated.
"Complicated" is one way to put it.
so you called him that night.
then what happened? Did you go and see him? - No!
no.
I called to break it off.
I heard him answer the phone, and I'd tried to talk to him, but the line went dead.
what about the woman in the parking lot? - I don't know.
von doesn't talk gang business with me.
had you seen her before?
she's come around a few times last couple of weeks, same thing.
lots of crazy yelling, then taking off. Look...
you, um...You gotta promise that Von doesn't find out about me and Gordon.
he keeps his cards close.
he could already know- killed Hodge out of jealousy.
trust me.
if Von knew, Gordon's wouldn't be the only dead body.
only one other person knew.
and that was bad enough.
who was that other person?
we have information that suggests you knew about Gordon and another woman.
Yes, I did. - How?
about four months ago, I found a valet stub on the driveway from the Deerfield inn.
so one night, I followed him and saw him go in with that biker girl.
did you confront him?
more like yell and hit him.
he promised he'd stop seeing her.
I took him at his word, and I never asked him about it again.
why not?
because I didn't want to hear him lie to me.
Mrs. Hodge...If you picked up on your husband's affair, you must've suspected about his other illicit activities.
I knew about the drugs and the partying.
he was surrounded by it.
why didn't you tell us about this earlier?
because Gordon is dead.
anything that I said or did would not bring him back.
my son draws stares and whispers because of his father, Agent Lisbon.
both of us- we deserve to grieve without shame and scandal, don't we?
Yes, you do.
and if she'd followed her husband once before, she could've tailed him again and killed him.
no, she didn't do it. She loved him.
she was a prisoner of her husband's life.
she gets rid of him, gets a fresh start.
people trapped in miserable lives always talk about escaping.
few actually do it.
it's easier just to close your eyes an pretend the misery doesn't exist.
boss, you might want to see this.
this is from a security camera across the street.
it was the third incident in two weeks.
building owner said Hodge didn't want to report the earlier ones because he didn't want Deerfield P.D. combing through his office and accidentally finding something in his sinner saints file. There.
magnify.
the woman from the parking lot.
she certainly gets around.
chaos Brigade controls distribution over in Rancho Rosa, but I figure if we move right now, we can move into Stratton.
what's up, my brothers?
we just have questions for you.
I've exceeded my quota of answering cops' questions.
and my quota of crazy.
the woman in the parking lot.
uh, like I said, she must've mistaken me.
she was seen vandalizing Hodge's office.
she find anything she shouldn't have?
his files were intact. She got nothing.
we have nothing further to talk about, then.
the sooner this case is closed, the sooner we're gone and you're back to business as usual.
last name is Guthrie.
she's the sister of a gentleman I was accused of killing.
falsely, of course.
trial was a couple of weeks ago, Gordon hit a home run. Got me off.
and you weren't eager to I.D. her because you didn't want us poking around your case?
Hey, all I know is that she's been coming around from time to time, saying some very offensive things.
thanks for your cooperation.
you think she killed Gordon?
like I said, thanks for your cooperation.
I've got one last question.
if Hodge wasn't the informant in your gang, who do you think it is?
I mean, I tried asking the D. A. but he's kind of a secretive bastard, huh?
what do you think?
Mr. Jane, we're a motorcycle club, not a gang.
and I can assure you there is no informant.
well, you'd know best.
why does he keep going on about this informant?
he's just talking.
let's get down to business.
so,
von Mcbride should be sitting here, not me.
court docs say your brother rick was an auto mechanic.
mcbride blamed him for screwing up a repair, and your brother refused to redo it.
mcbride allegedly got angry and killed him.
not "allegedly."
he killed him.
he beat him to death with a crowbar.
he murdered him.
and the jury disagreed.
mcbride acted in self-defense, right?
that's because that lawyer Hodge made it look like it was my brother's fault.
he started throwing around all these lies about my brother, saying that my brother was a druggie, that he was aggressive, that he was mentally unstable.
so you get all worked up, harass the gang, trash Hodge's office, right?
you want to arrest me for that, go ahead.
I'm not gonna fight you.
I'm too tired.
you ever try Hodge's home?
once.
but his kid came outside.
I don't have a beef with him, so I took off before I could do anything.
and what were you gonna do?
I don't know.
I was...
I don't know.
I wanted Hodge to understand what he had done to me and to my family.
when was this?
two days ago.
the day of the murder. Where were you that night?
home.
can anyone verify it?
I live alone, but I didn't...
now six months ago, you were arrested in a road rage incident.
got out of your car at a red light, attacked a man in an S.U.V.
what does this have to do with anything?
you're an angry person and you express it physically.
I'm not angry, I am sad.
my brother was a good man.
the only crime he committed was standing up to that bastard Mcbride.
Hodge blackens the name of your dead brother and gets Von Mcbride off.
now maybe trashing his office didn't give you enough satisfaction,
perfectly understandable if your frustration boils over.
and you can't touch Von Mcbride.
he's got 20 bikers around him all the time, so maybe you go for the easier target.
I didn't kill Gordon Hodge, but I'm sure as hell glad that he's dead.
she'd been to his house that day.
could've laid in wait and followed him later.
Plus, she was out for revenge- no more powerful motive.
we don't have nearly enough to charge her.
I say we hold her on the vandalism.
try to dig up something that puts her at the murder scene.
or you could release her.
she's obviously impulsive and sloppy enough to get caught on camera.
she'll think she's bought herself some time.
and she'd try something to cover her tracks and implicate herself.
cut her loose, then let's shadow her.
Yes, boss.
where are you going?
fresh air.
all this murder talk is rank. It stinks to heaven.
it hath the primal eldest curse upon't.
Shakespeare.
little less pressure on the brake pedal.
is your mom here?
market. That's why I'm confined to the driveway.
you want me to have her call you?
we know Felicia Guthrie trespassed on the property the day your dad was killed.
I-I just need to hear what happened.
uh, I was leaving for school.
I saw her hop the gate and come running up the driveway, so I ran out to try to stop her.
she was yelling all this stuff about my dad lying about her brother and getting Von Mcbride off.
then she just ran away.
did your parents see her?
no. Dad was already at work, and Mom was in the shower.
any reason you didn't bring this up earlier?
I don't know. I felt bad for her, I guess.
didn't want her to get in trouble.
well, just needed to confirm.
Thanks.
Aw, god!
you need to relax.
it's not gonna help.
I'm never gonna get the hang of this.
that's an easy fix. You need the right instructor.
all right. So now you can speed up a little.
excellent. I like how you're keeping your distance.
just trust your instincts. They're always right.
you're a good instructor.
Yeah, I am, probably because I have zero emotional investment in how you do...
unlike your father, who I'm guessing got annoyed with every mistake you made.
he wasn't the most patient guy.
probably didn't help that he was always on his cell phone.
been living with his job my whole life.
you get used to it.
you also get used to the drugs and the cheating on your mother?
he promised he'd stop.
Yeah.
can't be easy going through life being labeled the gang lawyer's son.
it wasn't really that bad.
I mean, girls would come up to me all the time, talk to me about dad and the gang, like I'm cool...
instead of a geek, which I basically am.
everybody is.
I am.
if he was my father, I tell ya, I-I...I'd be mad at him.
dad didn't mean to hurt anyone.
he was just doing his job.
right.
well, I guess I'd still love him if he was my father.
can't say I'd cut him the same kind of slack if I was married to him.
are you trying to blame my mom?
cause if you are...
what?
you're wrong, that's all.
she loved him, too.
well, that brings us back to Felicia Guthrie, who didn't love him at all.
what exactly did she say to you when you saw her?
it was hard to tell.
she was just, you know, ranting, basically.
didn't make much sense.
very nicely done.
you'll be out cruising on Saturday nights in no time.
just remember, trust your instincts. They're always right.
thank you. And thanks for the driving lesson.
Yeah.
still no movement.
looks like she's in for the night.
talk to Van Pelt recently? - Yep.
any progress? - Nope.
you hear that?
Yeah.
they're gonna go after Felicia.
mcbride thinks she killed Hodge, wants payback.
officers on Hampton, north of Lexington, request immediate assistance.
what the hell's going on?
go back in your house and stay down!
do the smart thing and get out of here right now!
we're not doing anything illegal.
disorderly conduct, concealed weapons, blown exhaust pipes, probably a couple of outstanding warrants in there!
screw you, pig!
no, Screw you!
we could bust half you clowns right now!
so what's it gonna be?
we'll be seeing you around.
you really don't like bikers.
if they think they can intimidate me, they're wrong.
Felicia, temperatures are running hot, so I need you to stay away from the gang's bar from now on.
Yeah. I'll stay away when you arrest Von Mcbride.
and what were you people doing out here, anyway?
Oh, we think you killed, uh, Gordon Hodge, so Agent Cho and Rigsby are watching you.
Oh, come on. She was never gonna buy, "we just happened to be in the neighborhood."
I told you I had nothing to do with that.
and who told you that you could go in my house?
Oh, this? Just needed some tea.
cut through the chill.
chill, my ass.
you were looking for evidence.
Felicia, take it easy.
don't tell me to take it easy, when this guy's rifling through my underwear drawer, looking for a weapon.
it was your closet, actually. I was looking for blood-splattered shoes.
get off my property.
you're very touchy.
go.
you really looked through her closet?
laundry, too.
she's been angry and emotional about her brother, which means that she was sloppy about Hodge's murder,
dragged evidence home with her.
it's just not inside.
well, there's no garage or toolshed.
well, I looked everywhere.
well, everywhere except the garbage.
why not?
well, it's garbage.
you done with that?
almost.
Yes, the case is still ongoing, and you are a person of interest.
I'd advise you not to leave town.
boss?
excuse me.
do you see that?
what's goin' on?
stay there. Don't move.
I didn't do anything wrong.
mcbride must've set me up.
Rigsby, put her in Interview One.
boss, Nina and Lucas Hodge are here to see you.
she say why?
because I asked them down here.
Rigsby, could you bring her through here, please?
it'll just take a minute.
thank you.
are you gonna tell me what this is about?
I'm just closing your case.
thanks for coming down, Mrs. Hodge.
this woman's name is Felicia Guthrie.
she murdered your husband out of revenge for getting Von Mcbride off a charge for killing her brother.
Oh, my god!
no, I did not kill anyone.
uh, we have evidence.
we just need your permission for, uh, Lucas to make a formal statement, saying that he saw her at your house the day of the murder.
you saw her?
well, he can fill you in later.
his statement will give us a better chance at a conviction.
Absolutely. Anything you need. - Great. Thank you.
Lucas, if you can confirm that this is who you saw, then you'll be on your way.
what's gonna happen to her?
well, probably life in prison.
uh, if she's lucky, she might get paroled in 25 years.
No! I swear, I didn't- I didn't touch him!
shut up!
you took everything from us.
Lucas, we need to book her now, so could you identify her?
no, she wasn't the one.
I mean, yeah, she came to the house.
great. Thanks. That's all we need.
take her away, guys. Thank you.
no, I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything wrong!
trust your instincts, Lucas. They're always right.
let's go.
she couldn't have done it.
what makes you say that?
I just know.
Lucas, they have evidence. This bitch killed your father!
don't call her that!
it wasn't her.
the only way we can know for certain is if you tell us who did it.
okay, stop talking to my son. You've got your statement.
Lucas, let's go. Come on! Let's go! - No!
Lucas! - Stop!
it was me.
we were out for a driving lesson.
I was driving badly that night, and my dad was on the phone the whole time, like he always was.
he'd get mad every time I'd make a mistake, but I just couldn't seem to concentrate.
because of your run-in with Felicia Guthrie that day.
you didn't talk about her until I asked, 'cause you felt sorry for her.
you didn't want to draw suspicion to her, because you knew she didn't do it.
you were trying to do the right thing.
I just kept seeing her in the driveway, crying, yelling about how my dad lied about her brother.
his phone just kept ringing...
and he'd get mad at me and I'd screw up worse, and I just...
I couldn't take it anymore.
next time his phone rang...
I grabbed it from him.
I heard her voice.
Hey, Gordon baby, it's me.
can you talk?
that biker bitch- Diamond.
she kept calling him "Gordon baby."
said she really wanted to see him.
Felicia Guthrie was right.
he was a liar.
I threw the phone into the woods, and he got mad.
he promised me he'd stop doing drugs and cheating on my mom.
and like an idiot, I believed him.
I called my mom.
she told me what to do.
I grabbed all the stuff to make it look like a robbery, but I couldn't get that damn cuff link out.
so I ditched his car in the lake.
she drove me home.
the lie gets heavy fast, doesn't it?
I expect after a while, you wanted to go to the police and tell them the truth.
sometimes I wanted to.
mom said no.
she promised it would be okay.
well, it might be...someday.
let's go.
I'm sorry, mom.
you know, I have to wonder how that cuff link Rigsby found made its way to Felicia Guthrie's house.
that is a conundrum.
because I'll bet a year's salary that if I look in the evidence locker, the cuff link we found on Hodge will have mysteriously vanished.
okay.
I needed Lucas to see Felicia get arrested.
you needed hard evidence to charge Felicia.
so...
I made it happen.
by making an innocent woman think she was gonna go to prison?
as if her life wasn't hard enough already.
Yes, you're right. She does deserve some justice.
it's good to see you care.
you know, sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.
yeah?
all right.
I'll be back in a minute.
over here.
what's up?
uh, well, I thought you might want to know we caught Gordon Hodge's killer.
it was his son.
lot of issues between 'em.
and you felt the need to tell me this from the shadows, dressed in this getup?
self-preservation.
I figured I'd worn out my welcome with your friends.
that's it?
this is what you had to tell me?
well, no. There's another reason.
you open that envelope, and the rat in your gang will be revealed.
Oh, the rat.
now turn around and try not to look too guilty.
what was that about?
what, this? This is, uh...
it's kind of funny, actually.
Yeah, funny?
selling us out is funny?
set up.
I'm seeing lights. Definitely people inside the house.
how many entry points?
Three--front, back, basement. Windows are all boarded up.
witnesses said three men took part in the abduction.
so figure those three inside plus a couple more just for five.
this is Mia Westlake. I want everybody to take another good, long look.
we have every reason to believe the kidnapper's got her alive in there, so be careful.
me, Hicks and Martinez take the front door.
Dyson and Shelly, you take the two-three corner.
BUCCI, Paulson and Fredericks, you take the three-four.
let's go.
ready. - Ready.
three, two, one.
stay where you are!
Lisbon? What are you doing here?
Atato you think?
what are you doing here?
you're waving your guns around, is what you're doing.
can you just put your guns away, please?
cowboys!
sir, the important thing is nobody got hurt.
all respect to your people, Lisbon, the important thing is we make sure that this does not happen again.
"CBI agents shoot each other" is not a headline that I want to see.
we came in hot because we thought the kidnap victim was there.
Mia somebody. - Mia Westlake.
marin county heiress. She was taken a day and a half ago.
witness gave us a partial plate on the kidnapper's car.
we dug up an outstanding parking ticket to a car in Oakland, checked the address,
found there were people inside a house that was supposed to be empty.
and he found you there because?
we got a call from the coroner's bureau.
there was a report of a corpse in a house.
but they were shorthanded-- budget cuts
so they asked us to go and check it out.
my team went in the house.
the corpse was there but the coroner wasn't, so we waited.
and everyone almost died in a hail of bullets.
where are you with Westlake?
we're set up inside the house. We're waiting for a ransom demand.
what's with the corpse?
a young male dead three to five years. Coroner couldn't be specific.
there were two bullet holes in the base of the skull.
it was wrapped in plastic and stored in a window seat.
do you have an i. d? - Not yet.
yes yet. Coroner's report just came in, and the corpse is...
why do I recognize that name?
Colin Haymer was a kidnap victim three years ago.
early 20s from San Francisco, wealthy family.
SFPD handled the case. Family paid the ransom.
that didn't work. Eerily similar to your kidnapping, don't you think?
who wants to bet Colin Haymer's kidnapper's the same kidnappers that kidnapped Mia Westlake?
well, could be a coincidence. - There are no coincidences.
I agree.
I want your people teaming up on this.
is that necessary? - I believe it is.
I want to foster better inter-unit relations.
let's stop stumbling into each other and try working together.
you have concerns. - I do.
this man is a... a... I-I don't even know what he is.
he's an accident waiting to happen.
Sam, be fair.
he-- closes cases, I know. - I do.
he does. - I do.
in my opinion, this is a mistake.
we're all agreed then.
off you go.
Mia Westlake was abducted 38 hours ago coming home from a gallery opening.
thank you, Rebecca.
uh, you need anything else?
no, we're good. Thank you.
this is copies of the case paperwork so far.
now the kidnappers forced her car off the road, killed the driver and then took her.
why kill the driver?
it's a message. They won't hesitate to kill the hostage if they don't get what they want.
Yes.
there's no ransom demand yet. How do we know it's a kidnapping?
they sent the family a proof of life a few hours later.
no blindfold. That's not good.
means they don't care if she sees anything.
good thinking, Bert.
what's your problem?
no problem.
Rigsby's correct. This is shaping up to end like the Haymer abduction.
let's make sure that it doesn't.
all right, I gotta get back to the Westlakes'.
I'd like to come with if that's all right.
I'd like to ask the Westlakes some questions about our dead guy, - see if there's any connection. - Okay.
start digging on the Haymer case. Contact the family, set up interviews.
and I'd like to leave Hicks here to work with your team.
that's all right with you? - Okay.
keep 'em honest. - What did he say?
care to reframe that, Sam? - No.
they're Jane's people. They need watching.
I like to think of them as my people.
well, think what you like. I can't have them trying to pull some cheap stunt behind my back.
well, we have a whole range of expensive stunts if you don't like the cheap ones.
I understand your issue, agent Bosco.
no problem. Welcome, Hicks. - Boss.
we'll extend every courtesy.
let's get started, shall we?
this is Verona Westlake. This is Mia's sister.
you must be CBI, too?
I'm agent Lisbon. That's Patrick Jane.
uh, my husband Duncan Weaver.
more CBI? Where did you guys come from, anyway?
two days ago, I never heard of you.
you neither. Nice place. You guys must be loaded.
how did you make the money?
uh, my grandfather, actually-- oil, lumber.
I just assumed it was new money, because of the, uh, the decor.
um, already you start with this crap?
what? What?
uh, Belinda Sandborne, Verona's attorney.
any conversation you have with Verona or Duncan, I need to be there.
not a problem. Is there someone else in the family we should be talking to?
I'm sort of... The family.
our parents are dead.
you know, Mia-- she's the grown-up, capable one.
I'm the mess. Too bad, huh?
they took the wrong sister.
you're doing fine.
listen to the man with the gun, babe.
we understand you're investigating a related case?
another kidnapping that may have been carried out by the same people, yes.
how did it, um, turn out?
did the--did the person they took get home okay?
no. He was killed.
his name is Colin Haymer. Here's his picture.
he's from pacific heights. Does he look familiar?
no. You, babe?
nothing. Sorry.
does his name ever come up in any context, even casually?
I don't think so.
he was working at a company called Straf Investments when he was taken.
do you have anything to do with them? - Straf?
Belinda? - No, I don't think so.
I'll check the records.
I'm sorry I'm not really helping. I'm trying. I'm--i'm not...
Hello! Okay. Look what I found.
Oh, god. Uh, Levi, what are you doing in here?
she's yours? - Yes.
uh, Mrs. Kent? Where is she?
Mrs. Kent! - Oh, she's fine.
she's a little smelly, but, uh, other than that, she's a little cherub.
sorry, sorry.
Mrs. Kent, please keep her in her room.
we discussed this. - Yes, ma'am.
boss, ransom demand just came in.
excuse me. - Sorry.
it's a video attachment to an e-mail.
can you get the IP address?
Oh, I'm trying, but they routed it through a bunch of servers. It might take days.
you--you want me to read this?
okay.
my name is Mia Westlake. I am not hurt.
I am being treated well.
for my safe return, you must pay $3. 75 million in small, nonsequential bills.
this money is to be ready by 6: 00 pm tonight.
you will be instructed what to do then.
failure to comply will result...
in my immediate execution.
any interference will result in my immediate execution.
Verona, if you're watching this, I...
did you see the tat on that guy? - Yeah.
I mean, that looks like Mexican mafia.
we're not gonna get anything out of the Westlakes now. Let's go.
3. 75 million--very specific number, don't you think?
maybe the kidnappers have their eye on the Westlakes' bank account.
I'll talk to Bosco about it, then we'll go.
okay. Take your time.
Wh--hey, excuse me. Uh, we'd like some privacy.
I can understand that. What's in your pocket?
none of your business.
you just keep tapping it...
tap, tap, tapping it.
whatever is in there, you're obviously nervous about it.
I'm assuming it's illegal.
my best guess would be... Drugs.
uh, do--do you have any lemon?
I'm gonna go find your boss, all right?
okay. Well, be sure to tell her about the drugs in your top pocket.
if you need me, I'm gonna be right here talking to your lovely wife.
please leave, all right? I just want to be alone.
that's what we all want. No one gets it.
so there's no lemons here?
no, I don't think so!
I really felt like... Mm, never mind.
your sister needs you here now.
as comforting as it might be to crawl under the blanket of narcotics that your husband has so generously procured for you, it's better that you don't.
nothing I do is going to help her.
you're probably right. - What's the point?
what you can accomplish is irrelevant.
but if you are absent in this moment, you will regret it for the rest of what will be a miserable life.
that's all. See you.
what were you doing back there?
Oh, just getting a snack, a little light refreshment.
why don't I believe you? - What? W-what is this?
this is proof of my veracity.
it's time to go. - I'm gonna stay.
I know what this is about.
Bosco's got the Red John file.
you think if you hang around long enough, you'll weasel your way into it.
"weasel" is a little strong.
you're wasting your time. Bosco will never go for it. Never.
what? I'll never go for what? - I like the way you work.
I want to work on your team on the, uh, kidnapping detail.
Oh, you do, huh?
a live kidnapping victim is so much more my speed than a shriveled corpse.
like I care about your speed.
Lisbon, you claim to have control over this whack-job.
why don't you do me a favor and walk him away? - Don't talk to me that way.
Yeah, that's very rude. - Quiet.
Minelli gave us specific orders.
I don't give a flying
you this agent's boss? - Why?
I want him removed from this case now. Now, all right?
he's--he's disrespectful and, uh, rude and--and unprofessional.
Oh, he's just angry 'cause I called him on his little drug deal thing.
okay, you're nuts. I have no drugs.
liar.
I demand you take this man off the case, or there will be serious consequences.
well, sir, that's not your call.
Oh, yeah? You think?
one phone call, I can have you directing traffic.
is that right? - Yeah, it is.
well, make your call, because this man's staying on the case whether you like it or not.
Really? - Yeah.
you see--see this? You see what he's done to my wife?
I mean, this guy's out of control.
shut up, Duncan.
baby, I was trying to explain - shut up.
Mr. Jane, is it? - Yeah.
what you said earlier was right.
thank you... I guess.
leave him alone.
okay, then. It's settled. Have fun. Boys.
wait.
SFPD sent over transcripts of the interviews from the Colin Haymer case.
so you want names that begin with "A" through "L" or "M" through "Z"?
"a" through "L" - You got it.
changed my mind. I want "M" through "Z" - Too late. You already chose.
Oh, come on. Rock, paper, scissors? Step up.
Hey, Bert, can I get on this rock, paper, scissors?
I haven't had a really good game since I was, oh, 10.
it's Rigsby. - I know.
Hey, what's with Hicks calling me Bert?
um, I'm sure I don't know.
it's Bert, like the muppet.
it's just a stupid nickname. It doesn't mean anything.
Bosco's team calls us Bert and Ernie.
you knew that, and you didn't say anything?
it would bother you. - It doesn't bother you?
no. - Why not?
Ernie's the clever, handsome one.
Where's Jane? - With Bosco.
don't ask me what they're doing, because I don't know and I don't care.
what do you got?
I've been checking out the house where we found Colin Haymer's body.
it's been abandoned seven years.
there were some complaints about squatters five, six years ago. Nothing else.
agent Lisbon, there's a Louis Earlen to see you in your office.
keep digging. - Right.
lieutenant Earlen. Thanks for coming.
Louis, please. I'm retired.
so you found poor Colin Haymer?
we did.
you were the SFPD officer in charge of the kidnapping investigation, right?
I was. Spent a lot of time with the Haymer family.
have they been notified? - They have.
hope it's some kind of consolation.
they've been waiting a long time for that boy.
we have another kidnapping. We think the same people might be behind it.
how can I help?
anybody you think we should take a look at?
tall order. We looked at a lot of people.
Louis, we were wondering if maybe it was an inside job.
the ransom demand was pretty specific.
we considered that.
I always had a feeling about Colin's girlfriend-- nothing solid, just a feeling.
do you remember her name?
Yeah. Talked to her a couple of times.
when's the ransom drop?
tonight, 6: 00.
the night Colin's ransom got paid,
I sat with his parents till morning just waiting to hear he was safe.
don't think we said ten words.
if it is the same people that took Colin, you do this girl's family a favor.
money drops at 6: 00. At 6: 01, you tell them their child is dead, give 'em a chance to it.
it would be a kindness.
boss, I might have something. - What?
those squatters in the house where we found Haymer?
they were drug dealers.
a detective in Oakland narcotics said they're an extended family--eight or ten people.
they grew pot on a farm called Crazy Hill in Goodhue county,
brought it into Oakland and sold it out of the house.
and this has to do with Colin Haymer how?
apparently, they also sold drugs that they bought from border cartels,
and they picked up some of the cartels' habits like kidnapping for cash.
so they went from dealing pot to kidnapping wealthy kids?
less effort, more profit. - Do you have any names?
they're known as the Crazy Hill gang.
one of the ringleaders was nicknamed "Deezer."
nobody knows his real name.
apparently, Deezer's been hanging around an apartment building in west Oakland.
boss wants us to check the building out.
forgot my extra mags. Meet you downstairs.
extra mags." Big man.
Where's your vest? - Don't need one.
sure you do. - We're just canvassing.
for people called "the Crazy Hill gang."
you should wear a vest. - Look, it's hot. It's uncomfortable.
Hicks isn't wearing one.
what, you're afraid he'll make fun of you? - No. Not at all.
don't be an idiot. Put on a vest.
fine. Get shot. See if I care.
there you go. One more?
she likes you. - She has good taste.
you're good with children.
unlike your employers?
I don't know what you mean.
Oh, come on. It's clear to see they're skittish about the parenting.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Verona's low self-esteem makes her doubt she'll ever be a real parent.
and because Duncan married her for her money, he sees the child as a rival,
in more than the usual freudian term.
they're very caring people, very loving, just not particularly hands-on, if you know what I mean.
how's Duncan's relationship with Mia?
it can be difficult.
well, it makes sense.
if he sees his child as a rival, why not his sister-in-law?
I've heard angry words between them.
I think Mia doesn't trust him.
but I shouldn't say anything.
no. But you did.
Jane, we got an errand to run.
okay. All right. Gotta go.
gotta go and run an errand with the big, serious man.
come on. Let's go. - Bye.
so what's the deal here?
well, the tattoo on the kidnapper's arm suggests the, uh, Mexican mafia might be involved.
those guys--they're members. So we're gonna go talk to 'em.
they look scary. - They are scary.
you can't because a full member until you've killed someone.
maybe I'll just wait in the car. - No. You're coming with me.
I need you for backup.
backup?
um, listen, I'm agent, uh, Bosco with the CBI. Agent Jane.
I was wondering if any of you fellas have seen your man Snoopy?
we need to talk to him. Snoopy?
we're lookin' for him. We'd like to talk to him.
Hey, keep walkin', man.
who are you? Why are you being that way?
I asked you nicely. I-I asked
the name is Raoul, and I ain't got no warrants, so back up, fool.
well, Raoul, you and me are gonna have to go have a private chat in a moment.
Nah. I ain't did nothing wrong.
don't make it difficult.
tough guys, huh? - Depends on what you mean by "tough."
emotionally resilient? Yes.
so now you gonna play me, too?
Oh, Raoul! Come on!
all right.
that's right.
what are you talking about, man? What informant?
Oh, come on. You can come clean with me.
who is this guy, Sam? What did you tell him? What's going on?
guess he just figured it out. - Well, it's kind of obvious.
as if you'd want me for backup. I mean, really.
listen, Raoul, you know about the Westlake kidnapping, right?
is Emme involved? - No.
I ain't heard anything about that. Westlake?
you sure?
sure, no, but when a big score's coming up, I hear about it.
people start bragging even before they got the money.
I ain't heard nothing about that.
well, we saw Emme tats on the kidnappers.
come on. Anybody can get a tattoo.
Yeah, they were kind of showy. A little too visible, don't you think?
like it was meant to misdirect us.
you know, that kind of stuff is getting to be a real problem
people putting their crimes on la emme.
so you jacked me up for nothing.
well, thanks a lot. Uh, we really appreciate it.
uh, come on. Get in.
only now you gotta punch me in the face.
may be people watching.
uh, yeah, they're watching. - Oh, come on.
serious. Next time you come at me in the street, make sure it's for a worthwhile question.
that was good. Did that hurt? Looks like it hurt.
watch your head there.
get in there.
Thanks. That was fun.
no actual progress, but, uh, certainly a lesson in life on the mean streets.
Yeah, well, that's what cops do.
we get a lead, we run it down.
most leads don't work out. We move on.
but you don't understand that, do you?
all this kind of hard, methodical work we do is somehow beneath you...
not your speed.
Oh, please, get off your horse.
you just wanted to frighten me and impress me with your macho cop prowess
understandable impulse. A little juvenile, perhaps.
you shouldn't be working with us.
you're hurting people. You know that? - Who?
the cops you work with. Don't kid yourself.
their careers are taking a hit.
if you care about 'em, you'll leave.
cops I work with, meaning Lisbon?
and her team.
but mostly Lisbon.
that ransom demand-- did she talk to you about that?
sure.
and yes, it could mean there's someone on the inside.
because useful to know who it is, don't you think?
well, we're working that, but the ransom drop's in three hours.
we make a move on a suspect now, all it'll do is spook the kidnappers.
they'll kill Mia, and they'll scatter.
we gotta make sure the girl is safe.
she's not gonna be safe.
they will kill her five minutes after they get the ransom.
could happen. - So she dies either way.
we could try something. - No.
you want to hear what I have to say? - Not interested.
okay, sure, all right. Well, I was very impressed, by the way, with the macho cop prowess.
those guys, they were genuinely frightened of you.
you're absolutely cool, man. You're good out there.
go away. Bullitt.
like, really cool. Kojak.
sorry to disturb you, ma'am. We're looking for an individual by the name of Deezer
might have lived in the building or stayed with someone here.
never heard of him.
what about the Crazy Hill gang? Ever heard of them?
no.
well, if you do hear them, you, uh, call us at this number?
you want me to spy on my neighbors?
fascists.
make a new friend, Bert?
enough with the "Bert," all right, Hicks?
sorry. Hurt your feelings?
it's just not funny, that's all.
it's a joke.
you can't take a joke?
excuse me, ma'am, I'm with the CBI.
wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
sure, what about? - I just think it's childish, that's all.
and I just think you need to lighten up.
sorry. Never heard of him.
all right. Thanks anyway.
yeah? Well, maybe you need to grow up. Idiot.
uh, not... Y-you.
um, Wayne Rigsby, CBI. Need to ask you a couple of questions.
ma'am, I was wondering if I could leave a card with you.
get in! Go!
Hicks, cover the room! Go, go!
went out the window. - I got it. Go, go, go!
grace, you okay? Just breathe. I can't see any blood.
the vest took it. I'm okay. I'm okay. Go, go, go, go, go. Go.
how you doing?
they think a couple rounds probably broke a couple of ribs.
they're gonna check for internal injuries.
I'm fine. Really.
just my legs keep twitching.
that's just adrenaline. It'll wear off.
don't ever do this to me again.
no problem.
go inside. See if there's anything in the shooter's apartment that ties her to the kidnapping.
okay.
you okay?
Yeah.
Hey, Rigsby. Thanks.
my leg's still twitching.
I love you.
Thanks.
I have to go. They don't even know I'm here.
I'll call you later.
one thing.
what was that for?
next time wear your vest.
okay.
I mean it. - Yeah. I believe you.
get out of here.
is she all right? - Yeah.
thank god.
well, thank Kevlar, actually.
hush. This is our fault.
uh, what do you mean?
Rigsby said that he and Hicks were going at it when Van Pelt was shot.
that kind of bad blood starts with us. - She's right.
this isn't about bad blood. It's about professionalism.
there you go again. You won't take any responsibility.
ID says the shooter's name is Diane Zaranski.
you're kidding. - Nope. DZ. Deezer.
Diane Zaranski was Colin Haymer's girlfriend.
SFPD suspected her of being in the gang that kidnapped him.
the Crazy Hill gang. Same crew must have kidnapped Mia Westlake.
well, now we know for sure they have someone planted in the Westlake house.
that's the way they work.
we're running background checks on everybody that's been inside that house in the past six months.
you're not gonna catch anyone with a background check.
they plan too carefully for that.
and you do know how to catch him.
of course. I told you I do. - Forget it.
you're not even gonna hear him out? - No, he's got nothing to tell me.
you know what? Jane's not the problem. You are.
you're so stuck on the idea that he's not a cop that you can't see what he is.
you know how many cases he's closed for us?
you think he's given me bad habits?
I think he's made me a better cop.
thank you, Lisbon. And can I just add--I just--be quiet.
if you're so sure you're right that you won't even listen to him, then you're not a person I know.
I did hear you out, and I still say no.
got the money and the instructions for the drop-off.
how much time? - About 20 minutes.
you're making a mistake. - Stop it.
I'm just-- - quiet.
Mrs. Westlake, I need to speak to you privately.
agent, I told you
I know. Counselor, I'm sorry.
stay here.
come this way. Right in here.
you are not welcome here, Jane. - I'm gonna tell Minelli you refused to work with me.
Oh, come on! - You can face him. How do you like that?
you know, you really are a schoolboy. You know that?
just...
now we're gonna do exactly as the kidnappers have asked.
that is the best way to ensure that your sister...
absurd. - Will come home safely.
but we're gonna do one thing.
we're gonna put this small transmitter in the suitcase.
Why?
if they fail to return her, this is the best way for us to follow them.
we're presuming they're gonna take the money to where your sister is.
idiocy. - What was that, Mr. Jane?
this is ridiculous.
you are gonna get that girl killed. - Stop.
excuse me, ma'am. There's something that you really should know.
keep talking. I'm gonna put my hands on you.
one of the kidnappers is in this house right now.
damn it. - Here?
a spy, a mole, reporting back to those that are holding your sister.
we should be talking to them, not playing with "Star Wars" toys.
Oh, my god. Who? - Come here.
her.
you bitch! - What? Jeez!
I'm gonna kill you!
my money's on Verona.
Sandborne's got her on experience, but it's hard to beat that kind of enthusiasm.
got the image up.
nobody. - There will be.
somebody better come.
if nobody does, you just killed Mia Westlake.
blame, blame, blame, blame, blame. Somebody's coming. Don't worry.
and there they are.
Hello, Mrs. Kent.
should we go get her?
no. Wait.
money's on its way. It's clean.
they tried planting a tracker, but I caught it.
get the girl ready.
hands where I can see 'em!
hands! Hands! - What's going on?
don't move. Don't do anything unless I tell you to.
I don't understand. The baby is sleeping.
Oh, the baby.
she's been wandering around the house like a little lost lamb.
you're just a terrible nanny.
who were you talking to on the phone? - My sister.
is a kidnapper, too? - No!
what's this?
let me go. Let us have the money. The girl might live.
put your hands behind your back.
you are making a bad mistake.
if you people don't let me go right now, Mia Westlake will be tortured to death
if they think you've done anything to me.
no, they won't. We're gonna go get her.
good luck finding her.
we don't need luck.
let's go.
checking... Last number called.
it's a landline.
1867 Cliff Point Circle, Oakland.
call Oakland PD tell them we're taking the house.
thought I would resurrect an old tequila tradition.
I'm in.
Cheers.
smooth. - Yes, it is.
so am I someone you know now?
I'm starting to recognize you, yeah.
you know that thing you said about Jane making you a better cop--you don't believe that.
I may have exaggerated for effect.
anyway, I wanted to say that it's been nice working with you again.
you, too.
anyhow...
good night. - Good night.
I've been thinking.
you're not a cop. You never will be.
but you have a... useful perspective.
this is a summary of the Red John case since I took over.
take a look. Tell me what you think.
Bosco. - Don't thank me.
I wasn't going to.
I need the actual case file--unabridged.
you're a jerk. You know that?
night, Bosco.
there's never a cop around when you need one.
how much?
can't say I'm crazy about the paint job.
how long to get an order from the factory?
how much you give me in trade for my Ford?
Really? Thanks a lot, you cheating bastard.
great show. Held over for a third straight year.
marijuana!
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome warmly...
country Joe and the Fish.
good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
we're certainly delighted to be here today.
we'd like to start off our portion of the show...
by giving you a taste of a little something we call rock and soul music.
this is really beautiful, man. You have to realize the turnabout...
that I've gone through in the last three days.
just to look, just to see, just to really realize...
what's really important.
the fact that if we can't all live together and be happy...
if you have to be afraid to walk out in the street...
if you have to be afraid to smile at somebody, right?
what kind of a way is that to go through this life?
they sure don't make pictures like that anymore.
there is no phone ringing, damn it!
there is no phone.
my God, it's almost dark.
they'll be waking up soon.
penthouse, Robert, and hurry. Oui, oui, sir.
this is your commentator Jonathan Matthias with another bulletin.
and now, as the Sino-Russian border war continues to rapidly escalate...
u. S. authorities are beginning to question to what degree we will become involved...
in what could swiftly grow into global conflict.

Hi.
another day, another dollar.
Hi, big brother. How's your ass?
as for you, I think it's your move.
join me?
miserable schmuck.
isn't he? Isn't he a sullen...
at it again, I see.
what'll it be tonight? Museum of science? Some library?
poor miserable bastards.
they almost got me tonight, you know that?
Neville come out!
shut up!
Neville! - Why the hell can't you leave me alone?
three, brother? Are you sure?
not three. - Three, brother.
two were inside the garage when he brought down the door.
we heard the shooting. Then Joshua.
the light. They should have stayed clear of the light.
there was no light, brother. Just the fire.
nonsense. Neville can't see in the dark. - Tell him that.
any more than we can see in the light. - To hell he sees.
good enough, he sees.
more! Burn it all!
caught in a place he cannot stir from in the dark.
alone. Outnumbered, hundreds to one.
nothing to live for but his memories.
nothing to live with but his gadgets, his cars, his guns, gimmicks.
and yet the whole Family can't bring him down out of that...
that honky paradise, brother?
forget the old ways, brother. All your hatreds, all your pains.
forget. And remember...
the Family is one.
but him, that thing...
that creature of the wheel...
that lord of the infernal engines and machines...
what day is it, anyway? Monday?
the hell it is. It's Sunday!
sunday, I always dress for dinner.
let me put the power to him, brother. Just a little nitro.
I can get the cannons out of the old guard armory.
we could have him out in no time. - I said no.
we could, but then the curse would begin all over again.
don't you see? - Yes, I see.
I see him living high in the light...
while we rot and hide like grubs.
what do you see, brother? - He will be destroyed, brother. He will.
but not by guns, not by machines, not by the evil forbidden things...
the tools that destroyed the world.
the world.
they destroyed the world.
the entire Los Angeles area.
already hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain...
and civil defense authorities state the situation is the same across the country.
marshal law is now nationwide.
major cities in all parts of the country: New York, Los Angeles...
report plague victims falling dead in the streets, in their homes, at work.
the first symptom appears to be severe choking...
followed by immediate unconsciousness. Death occurs within minutes.
whether a state of war between China and Russia still exists...
is not important any longer.
our fellow countrymen are dying.
the very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble...
under the dread assault of that horror long feared, germ warfare.
CONELRAD Channel. This is a class-one emergency.
all civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.
stay in your homes.
those found without specific military orders, are subject to summary execution.
stay in your homes. Repeat. CONELRAD Channel.
this is a class-one emergency.
all civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.
now the question is survival. Is this the end of technological man?
is this the conclusion of all our yesterdays, the boasts of our fabled science...
the superhuman conquests of space and time, the age of the wheel?
we were warned of judgment.
here it is. Here, now...
in the form of billions of microscopic bacilli.
this is the end.
I see.
let's try the test vaccine.
how the hell do I know?
we'll find out.
all right, I'll be there in an hour.
vaccine.
with fire, my brothers, we have purified all that lives with our zeal...
and we shall continue with our work.
with our devotion, we shall cleanse the world.
and Neville will come down, down to the Family into judgment...
down to punishment for his blasphemies.
here is the instrument of cleansing, my brethren.
and nothing quite cleanses like fire.
I was lucky today.
believe me, I was lucky.
he tried a gambit...
and it almost worked.
but it ended up a stalemate...
with the Family down three pawns.
what do you think his next move will be?
end games are always full of surprises, aren't they?
my move.
discovered check.
how does that grab you, Caesar?
your move, Imperator.
excuse me.
did you move?
balls.
you used to be a nice guy once, you know that?
and Speedy Bob Neville, his great legs churning...
goes flashing across the finish line...
with a 3-minute-and-50-second mile.
go ahead. I wanna see some son of a bitch beat that.
this is recording 6306, Rimini Boulevard, Sector 2.
last five blocks have been clear...
except for some signs they've been foraging for food...
in a small grocery store...
at 5500 block.
you'd think the prices would keep them in the supermarkets.
you gotta hand it to them. They sure cover their tracks.
two years.
if I could just find the nest, find out where they hole up.
all right, where's Matthias?
come on. Where's Matthias? Where's the hive?
journal recording 958. August 5, 1977.
I found another one, one of Matthias' group, dead of plague.
the sweep continues.
not my color.
wait! Come back!
I want to talk to you!
is this how it starts?
a trip to the laughing academy?
no, you silly bastard.
it starts with you asking yourself idiot questions.
right.
okay.
let's get cleaned up...
and find a drink before the bars close.
and, all brothers and sisters, I ask you to look at him.
does he have the marks? Do you see them?
you see him, as we were before the punishment...
before we gained grace.
you see lying there the last of scientists, of bankers, of businessmen...
the users of the wheel.
do we use the tools of the wheel as he does?
is he of the Family? - No.
is he of the sacred society?
then what is he? - Evil.
he is part of the dead.
he has no place here.
he has the stink of oil and electrical circuitry about him.
he is obsolete.
you are discarded.
you are the refuse of the past.
you're full of crap.
how hard it is to admit the truth.
take him to the little room for the questioning.
Mr. Neville, now we can talk a little while.
it's been a long time since you've talked, except to yourself.
tell me something, would you?
are you fellas really with the Internal Revenue Service?
your little jokes are meaningless, Mr. Neville.
or doctor, or colonel, or whatever it was they called you.
I'm a scientist. What the hell are you? - Definition of a scientist:
a man who understood nothing, until there was nothing left to understand.
so there is a little light in the forest after all.
a guiding light, Mr. Neville.
now to me has passed the responsibility...
for this last tiny remnant of mankind.
then why don't you quit these bloody games?
throw away those Halloween costumes, and get these people organized, damn it.
or are you already too far gone?
along road of truth... - For God's sake.
and we are very organized, Mr. Neville.
after last night, you should know that.
if you're organized, why don't you try finding a cure?
there is none!
there was no cure, and there is no cure...
but the Family has found its way.
we can bear it.
the only burden left is you.
but you've been trying to kill me for two years.
last night you killed how many?
three of us? And today, we don't know yet.
you're the angel of death, Doctor, not us.
he has confessed all, brothers.
murder, use of forbidden tools, practice of prescribed rites.
he admits science, medicine, weapons, machinery, electricity.
he has not shared the punishments.
he does not bear the marks.
marks?
show him, my children.
show him the pretty marks.
these are the marks, Mr. Neville.
the punishment, which you and those like you, brought upon us.
in the beginning we tried to help one another, those that were left.
we tried to clean things up, set things straight.
we buried things and burned.
then it came to me that we were chosen...
chosen for just this work.
to bury what was dead, to burn what was evil...
to destroy what was dangerous.
you're barbarians.
barbarians?
you call us barbarian?
this is an honorable name.
we mean to cancel the world you civilized people made.
we will erase history from the time...
that machinery and weapons threatened more than they offered.
and when you die...
the last living reminder of hell will be gone.
gone.
brother Zachary.
we are ready, brother.
here is evil. - Evil.
is this not the place, where all the dead were burned?
and this is the last of the dead.
and what shall we do with him, my brethren?
burn.
the dark! - Turn off the light!
get those lights out!
give us the dark!
bring back the dark!
who the hell are you?
shut up.
he's gone!
find him. That's an order!
find him! - Go, man, go!
move!
you son of a bitch, just hold tight. Up against the wall, you mother.
don't turn. Just stand. I'll turn you when I want.
on or off, up or around, I'll turn you. Now cool it!
now, put your hands out.
way out about shoulder high, like they're gonna crucify you, baby.
matter of fact, they were gonna roast me. Why'd you stop 'em?
don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
you got any more questions, fathead?
my name is Robert.
your name's mud.
down the tunnel!
after him!
back!
okay, hold it. Open it up.
you. You're the... - Your living Playtex doll.
now come on, man. Get the bike. Move! Pull it out!
you really plan ahead. - It helps.
now look, you gotta run this thing, you understand, but I'm the ramrod.
those stadium lights, how'd you manage that?
dutch knows all about that stuff. - Dutch?
come on, man. Get on the bike.
don't screw up. I know how to roll, but it's hard on the elbows.
and if you just have to play James Bond...
I'll bust your ass.
Yes, ma'am.
don't let him get away!
goddamn it, left, and step on it!
move! Down the tunnel, man.
hit it. They're blinded.
okay, baby. Hitch up your drawers.
I thought we'd gotten past that. - You're sweet.
it's okay, Tommy.
this is the man, and I mean the man.
but he's cool. It's okay.
come on, man.
this is it. That's all there is.
at least all we know of.
there are others, I guess, if Matthias and his brethren haven't killed them all.
I didn't know there were any left.
between the Family at night and you in the daytime...
shooting at anything that moved, man, we had to stay low.
I had to stay alive.
the mad bomber himself.
and I see you got the mad scientist.
you know me? - And about your work.
my work?
Biowar pathology perimeters in urban and semi-urban environments.
journal of Military Medicine, June, 1974.
incremental effects, countermeasures to toxic agents, and liquid systems delivery.
microbiological Letters, January, 1975. Remember?
that's a nice recitation. You know what it means?
I was a med-school senior when they scratched the world.
as a matter of fact, I was gonna apply to Biowar Labs for my post-doc...
but the next term never came. - Sorry you didn't make it.
sorry the world didn't make it.
come on. Let's go see about Richie.
Lisa's brother. He looks like he's about to go over.
you've only seen the tertiary cases, Matthias and his people.
we're not that far gone, but we're on the road.
the yellow brick road. We're off to see the wizard.
when it hit, the older people either died or went to the third stage fast...
you know, blindness in light, albinism...
psychotic illusions, occasional stages of torpor, like Matthias and the things there.
what about you? Why didn't you get it? - I don't know.
some of the younger people have a kind of...
resistance.
I don't know, we just hold out.
some of us are a bit light-sensitive, otherwise, we're all right.
but Richie's definitely going.
he's advanced secondary. Incidentally...
mind telling me what keeps you in the city?
you some kind of exterminator?
I guess maybe you could call it that.
very complicated, Doctor.
I'd be living on top of City Hall, or better, the Oxy Tower...
instead of that pillbox you're in.
that's where I live. It's where I used to live.
it's where I'm going to live, and not Matthias nor his Family...
nor any other son of a bitch is going to make me leave.
he's no better.
his fever is high.
what are you... - Shut up.
keep out of the way.
sit down.
could stay this way for weeks, or he'll go over 10 minutes from now.
I've seen them go before.
I almost got killed by a friend of mine last summer.
he went over without any warning.
when I looked away...
his face was pale and his hair was going. When I looked back...
he didn't have any eyes.
what did you do?
I did just like you'd do, Doctor. I killed him.
if the Masonic rites are over.
how about Richie?
we'll take him to my place. I got nearly everything I need there.
is there anything you can do, Doctor?
I mean, seeing how you've lost over 200 million patients.
I don't have it.
have what?
the plague. I'm immune.
everybody has it. - Everybody but me.
there was a vaccine, just an experimental batch.
we weren't sure it would work.
why, if you're immune, you could... - That's right.
my blood might be a serum.
at the stage that boy's in, my antibodies could reverse the whole process. Stop it.
Christ, you could save the world.
screw the world. Let's save Richie.
nothing with drugs. It's got to be the serum.
couldn't you reconstitute the vaccine?
you got any idea how many steps it takes...
to synthesize an antibiotic specific for this bug?
got the picture. - I've tried. God knows I've tried.
once I caught one of Matthias' people last year...
and tried everything on the shelves on him.
he damn near killed me...
and then he died very badly himself.
so it's very tight, Doctor.
very tight.
bring him in here.
in the bed.
I see where you do your heavy thinking.
one side keeps the other side going.
can't have one without the other.
I'm a narcissist. - How do you do?
the guest room. - You weren't expecting us?
I wasn't expecting you.
hold these.
I'm gonna need some help.
Lisa will have to do.
I hate to leave the kids alone too long. They get spooked.
watch your mouth.
some of the kids, you know what they say?
what do some of the kids say?
they say the Family comes in the night when it's dark.
they say they're going to come some night and take Richie's soul...
and tie it all up in a bag and give it to the devil.
is that really true? Do you know if that's really true?
we wouldn't let that happen.
not a chance.
are you God?
let's find out if he's a doctor first before we go promoting him, okay?
okay.
how about a break?
your move.
I just made my move.
Where'd you get that dress?
the same place you got that jacket. I hustled it.
the house fuzz was on vacation.
his voice...
I'll never get used to it...
to hearing it.
something...
we were with them for a while, you know?
with Matthias?
you were a part of that Family?
when it happened, when even the army fell apart...
and there was nobody left except those living alone like animals...
Matthias walked the streets at night...
ringing a bell.
Richie and l, we had us a place in the back of a furniture store.
one day, we hear this bell.
so we go out to see, and there are people there.
we thought we were alone...
just me and Richie with millions of corpses.
but there was Matthias and other people.
anyway, he gave us the Family for a while.
we helped with the burials.
we helped with the burnings.
but when it was over, and the worst was past...
they began to know how different we were, our skin, our eyes.
one day while they were asleep, we just took off.
how'd you get mixed up with Dutch and his group?
dutch came by one day, and said he was with the Census Bureau.
now, what are you thinking?
you know the old song?
"if you were the only girl in the world and I were the only boy," okay...
but, until then don't bother me?
I guess I'm the only boy.
the Family.
I forgot to keep the fuel up in the generator.
they'll be into the garage!
you stay here.
what's this for? - Comfort.
you may not have time.
more time than Neville has, brother.
when he comes back, I'll be waiting... - Take care.
he has the luck of a devil. - I know.
but this time his luck has run out.
you can take down that service flag now, mother.
man, don't scare me like that.
you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.
what's this stuff about me being the only girl in the world?
do you know it's been a long time?
I'm not sure I remember how this goes.
how is he? - He's stable.
no loss of pigment since yesterday and vital signs are steady.
he's comfortable.
I'm sorry.
it's been a long time since I've had a patient.
doctor, you certainly haven't lost your bedside manner.
is that so?
are you ready for this?
what is it?
birth control pills.
Yeah.
here we are.
I can make toxins from both of these.
all right, now the tourniquet.
good and tight.
that's fine.
give me the swab.
all right, you get the needle.
go ahead.
all right, take off the tourniquet.
will one bottle be enough?
it's genuine 160-proof old Anglo-Saxon, baby.
I was a very peculiar doctor in those days...
trying to find treatments for diseases that hadn't existed...
till other doctors invented them.
now I'm the only game in town.
I don't know how much. I'll draw blood as often as I can.
we'll just have to keep pumping it into him.
how long do you think it'll take? - I don't know.
I really don't know.
but if it does work...
then Richie will be the source of even more antibodies.
the more people we inject...
the more serum we'll get.
and when that's done...
when that's done, baby, we will pull out.
we'll take what we need and head for the mountains.
out of "rats' alley Where the dead men lost their bones.
T. S. Eliot turns out to have been just as good a prophet as he was a poet.
the Waste Land.
I wonder if it comforts him.
I wonder if I'll ever see a stream full of fish again.
Where'd you ever see a stream full of fish in Harlem?
at the movies.
does that hurt? - A little, yeah.
it hurts. How about off, man? Turn it off.
a week ago, that much light would have sent you right up the wall.
I'm beginning to see the light.
I'll have another batch of serum ready in a few hours...
then we'll load up that Land Rover, pick up Dutch and the kids...
and go to the hills. How about the Sierras?
Yeah.
baby, we made it. We really made it.
I think I'll go pick up some stuff for the trip.
is there anything special you fancy, baby?
what I pick up today, you're going to be seeing for a long time.
why don't you skip it? - Honey.
the most dangerous thing I ever ran into in one of those stores was you.
you watch yourself.
you stay on the ground floors, near the doors, and in the light.
if you see anything, shoot. - Check.
honey, can I borrow your credit cards?
is that gonna be for me?
you don't need any more.
this is for Lisa.
one of these days, she may... - Start to turn?
that's always a possibility.
it's best to catch these things early.
then you don't think the serum would work...
for tertiary cases?
what do you mean? - Like Matthias.
the Family.
it's hard to say.
would it?
come on, help me with this.
put the cap on that. Put it in the refrigerator.
I can't afford to give more blood till I get clear of this town.
later on, if your blood count comes up...
and you put on some weight, we can use your blood to make serum.
yeah?
Yeah. Now, go eat your soup.
someone ought to do something about those people.
how about it?
you gonna give them the serum? - Fat chance.
how come?
we'd have to be here for a few more months, for one thing.
for another thing, they're homicidal maniacs, for God's sake.
man, they're humans. I mean, they're sick, you know?
they're vermin.
okay, then.
if you don't want to cure them, kill them.
if I just knew where they're at.
the old court building, that's where.
in the Civic Center.
that's where they're holed up.
you're kidding me. - They're there.
go on. Ain't you gonna go down there and zap them?
why not?
you've been looking to kill them for practically two whole years now.
either kill them or cure them, damn it.
no need.
they're half-dead right now.
you know what, mister?
you're hostile.
you just don't belong.
nice of you to let me hang around.
at times, you scare me more than Matthias does.
how's Richie? - Beautiful. It works.
it works.
my God, it's a beautiful world!
don't you think we ought to do something?
damn right.
I've got some blood to make up serum for Lisa.
we'll start on the rest of you in a week or so.
can you have the kids ready to leave tomorrow?
gonna take me a little ride in the sun.
where are we going?
away, that's all. Just away.
someplace nobody ever bothered with. A river nobody ever dammed...
a mountain nobody built any bloody freeways to...
where everything we do will be the first time it happened.
you got it. That's it. Just like in the beginning of the world.
like we were starting all over again in the Garden of Eden!
only this time, we don't trust no frigging snake!
scout, I wonder if we're gonna have room for you.
going to find out who's right.
you or me.
why are you here? - I came to help you.
you know the man. - Neville?
that's him.
he's got a serum for what's wrong with you.
and if you could just talk to him, get with him...
then everybody could be...
yes? Everybody could be what?
everyone...
everybody could be normal again.
I see.
we could be as we were before? - I guess so.
the way we were. - The way we were.
that's what Neville thinks we want? Is that why you?
he didn't send me. He... - Silence!
he sent you to offer us something from his world...
to change us back to the creatures we were. A trick!
a trick to weaken our resolve.
I was almost like you, but he saved me. He brought me back.
he wants us all to go away from here.
you have been damned, Richard.
don't you see that? Don't you?
prepare the Family.
tonight...
I think Neville might come out.
the Family is one.
the Family is all.
we have cleansed the world.
outside the Family, there is nothing at all.
the Family.
Oh, my God.
Yes, Robert?
about Richie...
I know.
you know?
Matthias told me.
it was necessary.
my God.
come in.
sounds strange, doesn't it?
come in, Neville.
I thought we might arrange a little entertainment for you...
before time for concluding our little business.
my brothers.
we waited for you, Neville...
so you could see this, the end.
the end of all you've done. You see, none of it was real.
it was illusion. Your art, your science.
it was all a nightmare, and now it's done.
finished.
my brethren...
our task is nearly complete.
he was the last of those who brought the punishment to us.
we have cleansed and purged his world.
now we must build.
build coffins. That's all you'll need.
bring him.
all right, stand back!
back up!
stop him! Don't let them get away!
it's 10 minutes to sunup.
we'll have to chance it.
I want... - Damn it, it's jammed.
I want you.
for God's sake, come back in the light.
the bad dream is over, friend Neville.
now we can sleep in peace.
Robert, you're evil.
I'm part of the Family.
I'm sorry.
the Family.
you don't understand.
put her in the truck.
let's move, kids. We got a long way to go.
Hey, you.
Hey, thought you'd gone home. - I wish. We're up.
there's a double homicide in Rancho Rosa. Local sheriff's in over his head.
I'm on it.
boss, you've been promising me more time in the field.
now's as good a time as any. - You're right.
Rigsby, be a cover in the office on this one. Let's go.
you're okay with this, I hope? - Absolutely, yeah.
what's going on?
looks like two bullets to the chest for each of them.
freshness of the wounds suggest it happened in the last few hours.
Selby and Jana Vickers, 33 and 31 years old, from here in Rancho Rosa.
sheriff ID'd them from their driver's licenses.
who found the bodies? - Couple of teenagers.
this place is a local lover's lane. Apparently, thieves know that, too.
sheriff thinks that it's a robbery gone sour.
little old to be necking, aren't they?
there's an age limit on that?
plus their clothes aren't, you know, disheveled.
good point. Oh, there's a little white thing there, sticking out from Jana's dress.
could you ju... Yeah that's it.
$800 dress.
is that a useful "aha" or an irritating "aha"?
the borrowed dress tells us they were going somewhere fancy and wanted to make an impression. Not usually something they'd go for, or they'd have a later model car.
he needed a few pulls on the scotch just to take the edge off because he was nervous about who was gonna be there, which in a small town like this, likely means relatives or people from his past.
uh, wedding, maybe? Or birthday party?
no gift, which leaves...
no guessing games.
uh, excuse me, sheriff? What's the name of the local high school?
Oh, my god. You look fantastic.
I'm sorry. I'm not Stephanie.
do that again, and I'll arrest you.
sorry, I had to. You've always been the one.
no way.
I'm not the one.
high school. Best years of your life.
welcome back to Rancho Rosa high. Go, toros!
I'm Tess... One of your student ambassadors this weekend.
nametags and reunion books.
we're with the California bureau of investigation.
we need to know if Jana and Selby Vickers were expected here tonight.
Yeah, Selby Vickers and his wife Jana.
they also replied "yes" to tomorrow's homecoming picnic and dance.
is everything okay?
we need to talk to somebody who would know them.
redheaded woman... That's Willa Brock.
she's the reunion committee chair.
you didn't really think we were young enough to be in this class when we walked in, did you?
Oh, everyone over the age of 21 looks the same to me.
tactful and evasive... You're gonna do very well in life, Tess.
go, toros.
I'm stunned. I mean, it was surprising enough Selby was even coming.
now this? - Why the surprise?
well, he wasn't at the fifth or the tenth.
because - Because he was expelled and never graduated.
Selby pulled this... It was a really nasty prank.
what was it, senior year? - Yeah.
it was his one and only. Vice principal Desouza caught him, gave him the ol' boot.
what was the prank?
uh, there was this, shall we say, socially challenged boy named Derek Logan.
Selby dragged him into the girls' locker room, he blindfolded him with his own underwear, tied him up, naked, took his picture and then posted it all over the school.
I mean, how sick is that, right?
it was disturbing.
uh, is there anything else you can tell us about him?
I played football... starting running back.
people around here are still talking about the five touchdowns I scored against Stratton.
what does that have to do with Selby?
I was popular. I was a jock. He was a nobody.
I don't know what kind of person he was.
how about his current life?
I got nada. I got out of this town as fast as I could.
I live down in Newport Beach now.
how about you, Willa? Have you heard anything about Selby?
I host a daytime talk show in Chicago that tapes two shows a day and is about to go national.
I'm lucky if I hear anything about my own family.
uh, Derek Logan... That kid that Selby pulled the prank on...
could you point him out to us? - Derek Logan?
he's not here, is he? No way!
Gabe, it's so good to see you again.
you almost didn't.
5 hours I spent on the 101 driving here.
CBI agent Teresa Lisbon, Patrick Jane, this is Gabe Nyland.
da for San Diego county.
you've prosecuted a couple of cases for us.
and now candidate for lieutenant governor of California.
give me the word, G ,I start twisting arms for you on election day, huh?
um, Gabe, Selby Vickers and his wife were found murdered at the Glen...
shot in their car.
my god. I hadn't even heard that name in 15 years till tonight.
any idea who did this? - It's early in the investigation.
you just got here, right? - yes.
so how is it that you knew Derek Logan wasn't here?
well, Derek left the school and moved out of state after that prank Selby pulled.
word is he killed himself. - Are you serious?
I heard he was a blackjack dealer at a casino.
uh, we'd like to talk to some classmates that still live in the area.
maybe they know something about Selby.
well, there are only a few, but, uh, the student ambassadors can probably point you in the right direction.
thank you for your time.
nothing jumps out on this, but I'm gonna have the tech guys give it a once-over.
mail's all big bills and small bank accounts.
they certainly weren't living the high life here.
they didn't need to. This was home. They were happy.
agent Grace Van Pelt.
so I got you next of kin info on Selby.
uh, mother in Rancho Rosa. No luck on Jana, though.
Thanks. Text me the address? - Will do.
so I've never been to Rancho Rosa before. What's it like?
nothing special. A town.
cool. What are you guys doing now?
you know, investigating.
van Pelt, come here. Check this out.
I gotta go. - Y- yeah. I'm... I'm busy... too.
this is from yesterday morning.
I'm done playing games here. You hear me?
either you get me my money, or I'm gonna be forced to take action.
so much for happiness.
so you haven't seen Selby once in all these years?
supermarket, movie theater maybe?
no. I mean, you know, if I did, I - I don't remember.
hard to believe you, Stu.
I'm sorry? - Uh, really? Okay.
the hair plugs, the heels, this, uh, professional woman here posing as your girlfriend...
wait, wait. What did you just say? did he just call me... Did you... I - I mean... Did he say to me that...
that's all we need for your time.
that's all the questions we have now, so...
that's all we have for now. Thank you.
I think you look lovely. Have a good evening.
go, Toros.
what's your problem?
uh, it's just a room full of people lying to each other.
everyone here is trying so hard to show how much they've changed, when the mere effort screams that they haven't.
or they actually do change... with exceptions like Mr. Hair plugs, of course.
you got the rebel who took the bank job, the player that stays faithful to his wife...
the rebel took the bank job because she sees her rebellion is fruitless.
the player stays faithful to his wife because the consequence of infidelity is much greater now.
but their instincts... Their instincts never change.
I'm a far cry from what I was in high school.
eh, I wouldn't be so sure.
driven to succeed to the point of developing an ulcer, no tolerance for superiors less sharp than yourself, shutting out girls that wanted to hang out with you, blowing off boys that want to get close...
all the while, at every turn, wondering, "what is it I really want?"
no. - and you played an instrument.
my guess? Clarinet.
not even close. And we're done here.
I'll get the guest list to Rigsby. I'll have him check everybody out.
have him locate the whereabouts of Derek Logan.
you really think logan Laid in wait for 15 years and suddenly decided to take revenge on Selby?
well, I think that Logan is as angry today as he was 15 years ago, maybe even angrier.
we'll check him out. - You know, I'm gonna stick around.
I - I didn't go to high school. This is kind of fascinating for me.
you never went to high school? - No, I was busy.
you can stay. Just don't make me sorry I let you.
bassoon.
Mrs. Vickers, when was the last time you spoke to your son?
um, this morning.
Selby always checks in on me before he goes to work, to see how I'm doing. He's...
was sweet like that.
were you aware of any problems he was having? Work? Personal life?
um, no. Just the opposite.
uh, things were starting to get good for him.
after he left high school, things didn't go right for him.
about high school... The prank he pulled...
I don't want to talk about that.
ma'am...
his whole life was spoiled by that... that incident.
he lost a chance at college.
he... He got stuck working in a little print shop.
and then Jana came along, and...
and she was like a whole new world for him.
she encouraged him, and she told him to... to strive for something better, and... and he became a whole new person.
we haven't been able to track down any family for Jana.
do you know where we can find them?
she didn't have anybody...
uh, nobody that I know of.
she moved here from Poland, and Selby only met her a couple of months ago.
a few dates and... and they got married.
it was all kind of a whirlwind.
now, Mrs. Vickers, it's a bit unsettling, but I'd like you to listen to this message, see if you recognize the caller. Is that all right?
Yeah.
I'm done playing games here. You hear me?
either you get me my money, or I'm gonna be forced to take action.
well, I-I've never heard that voice in my life.
was my son involved with a loan shark or something?
could be. We traced the phone call to a phone booth in Galatin.
that doesn't really tell us... - Galatin? Th-that's where Jana's from.
uh, S-Selby met her there at a coffee shop when he was on a delivery run.
can you tell us anything about Jana before she met Selby?
maybe names of friends, where she worked?
no, all that Selby told me was that things were tough for her.
Yeah, he didn't share any details, probably 'cause he didn't want me making any judgments.
you remember what we used to call you?
you were the frogman.
frog... because you played the french horn...
and 'cause, you know, y - you kinda sorta look like a frog, but no offense, but...
Yeah, no, I-I remember.
Oh, man, we used to get on you.
you know what? I'm sorry about that, sincerely, but, I mean, what? We were kids, right? We were just kids.
forget it, forget it. I have.
dude, that... that time we put the dead bird in his locker.
Ohh, we did that.
Yeah, yeah, you guys got me with that one.
does anybody still call you that... "the frogman"?
well, pretty much everyone calls me "phil,"
except my son, who calls me "dad."
you fathered a kid? He fathered a... he...
go, frogman! Come on. Nice!
good job. Didn't think you had it in you.
wait. Does he play the french horn, too?
because if he does, you could call him frogboy...
or... Kermit. Or kermie.
really good to, uh, see you guys again.
come on. Hey, if the kid of yours ever needs any shaping up, you send him to a Cordova sports camp, okay?
vodka tonic, please.
uh, top shelf. It's on me.
thank you.
you're one of the, uh, one of the CBI people.
Yeah.
I heard about what happened to Selby. That's... That's awful.
well, it doesn't appear to have dampened the mood here.
LJ Cordova seems to be having a great time.
Yeah. Frogman.
if I could go back in time and beat the crap out of him the first time he called me that...
it's not possible, phil.
Oh, I know.
but you could just talk to him quietly and tell him how you feel.
he'd probably just laugh at me. - Probably.
but at least you would know that you made an effort, right?
and this is a... What? It's a 15-year school reunion.
what are these reunions for, anyway?
I don't know. - I understand.
all those nights you lay there not being able to sleep, thinking about whether or not you should've confronted him.
it's tough.
you know what? You're right.
you go, phil.
Hey, LJ. - What up, frog?
what's your problem, man?
you know, this thing is a golden treasury of mullets.
a brawl? You started a brawl? Come on.
well, I was, uh, I was going for something a little more contained, but I guess people just wanted to explore the physical.
and what information did you glean?
I assume you were testing some theory or other?
wow, Willa Brock was involved in eight different school activities, and she looked pretty good in cargo pants, which is hard to do.
there are people in the hospital.
Yes, but souls were healed. This was a cathartic brawl.
please. - Got a lead.
Jana's INS Entry records list a Galatin address as her destination...
the property and residence of a Terence Badali.
no real sheet, but he had a couple restraining orders from women back in the '90s.
he could be our angry caller.
go to Galatin. Take Van Pelt with you. - Okay.
you... Go to hell. Take a toothbrush.
which way is that? I'll go.
what's so funny?
if I want culture, I'll leave my yogurt out overnight.
LJ Cordova's yearbook photo quote.
well, when you're done entertaining yourself, I got your Gerek Logan update right here.
kid's life never turned the corner.
Derek Michael Logan left Rancho Rosa a couple weeks after the Selby incident.
family moved to Virginia. He became a heroin addict.
couple years in and out of rehab.
he died of an overdose on his 23rd birthday.
school office has sent over his old student ID from their archives.
you know, he kind of looks like you.
and, uh, this is the photo of the incident that, uh, Selby plastered around the school.
how does any kid recover from that?
well, in this case, they don't.
how sad.
and I was betting on Derek Logan as our killer.
will you quit yanking me around?
okay, if you can't get it right, we're through.
now the order was for 5/16th beech wood, not for 5/16th warped beech wood.
need to talk to you about Jana Vickers.
I'll call you back. What about her?
you left a threatening message on her answering machine recently.
well, how do you know it was me?
because an innocent person would say,"I didn't do it."
so what? I called her. Big deal.
you called her and threatened her.
now she and her husband have been found killed, and so...
you're under arrest.
I panicked. As soon as you told me they were dead,
I knew you were gonna blame me, and my brain said,"just run."
your brain's a fool. Where were you last night?
I was watching college ball.
can you prove that?
Notre dame sucked.
I live alone... Since that polish bitch left me.
I met her through this internet service.
uh, y-you pay a whole bunch of money, but you get to choose from these videos, and then they bring her over to the country, and she marries you.
that's a good deal.
Oh, I tell you, man, these eastern european types...
they know how to take care of their men.
right. What happened?
well, she left me for this Vickers guy.
she comes to me one day, says she met this guy at work, they fell in love...
must've made you angry. - Yeah, you bet it did.
so you threaten to kill them unless they pay you off.
no, no, no. I threatened to turn her in to the INS, because she had lied about all these things on her form.
she was in this country under false pretenses.
how much were you asking for?
well, I just wanted my money back...
the money I put up to get her over here.
I saved all my receipts. It was 25 grand.
well, and 5 grand for emotional suffering.
and what was her response?
she said they'd pay it. She admitted she owed me the money.
they were broke. Any idea where they were gonna get the money?
Jana said that Selby was gonna get it from an old friend.
they guaranteed Badali they'd have it for him monday, in cash.
at least we know Selby's sudden interest in the reunion.
he was protecting his wife. It's kind of romantic.
noble, even. - Motive, even.
he must have asked somebody for money who really didn't like him asking.
Yeah, nice work, Grace.
I need to see that list of all the reunion attendees' arrival times.
Oh, yeah. Here you go. - Thanks.
so, uh, you and Cho Saw some action, huh?
little bit, yeah. - That's cool.
you have Gabe Nyland arriving by plane the day before the murder.
are you sure that's right?
Yeah, there's an airfield in Stratton, the next town over.
I checked the arrival logs. He flew in by private jet.
be careful who you vote for for lieutenant governor.
one of the candidates lies.
yes?
it's agent Lisbon and Patrick Jane.
we just have a few follow-up questions for you.
how can I help?
last night at the reception, you said you'd just gotten in, but we know you flew in the day before the murders.
can you explain the discrepancy for us?
come on in.
I came a day early for a private fund-raising dinner.
I said I'd just arrived, because I didn't want my classmates thinking I'm up here shilling during reunion weekend.
this is a nice room. Is it the, uh, presidential suite?
something like that.
is the bedroom nice? How's the mattress?
uh, it's adequate.
can I see it? - Well, no. Why would you want to?
why not? - Because I'm entitled to my privacy.
hello again.
there was no inappropriate relationship.
you call it an inappropriate relationship.
the law calls it soliciting sex from a minor.
she came to my door, had an idea she wanted to discuss about a youth voter effort for my campaign.
I'm not going to discourage some enthusiastic kid who wants to get involved.
no, no. You hide 'em in your bedroom.
I had to. Media people follow me everywhere I go now.
if I open that door and it's some guerrilla photographer, our faces end up on the internet, both of our lives are ruined.
you're very good at this... Selling a case with passion, even though it holds no water.
explains why you're such a successful D.A.
it's the truth. - Well, that should be easy to confirm.
Lisbon, could you have the social worker bring, uh, Tess in, please?
no, please.
this is on me. She didn't ask for any of this.
you care about her. You genuinely care about her.
well, she's very friendly... and diplomatic.
diplomatic... and evasive, like a politician...
like her father.
that, and you have the same shape front teeth.
they are your real teeth, aren't they?
she's your daughter?
her mother was a year behind me.
Tess was born a few weeks before I graduated.
families agreed to keep it quiet.
but I've always done right by Tess.
come out to see her whenever I can. Discreetly, of course.
did you ever see Selby when you visited?
last year, at a gas station just outside of town.
we said a quick hello, went our separate ways.
maybe Selby found out about Tess, threatened to expose you.
not Selby Vickers. He wouldn't threaten a fly.
a super nice guy. He tried to do right by people.
What'd you talk about with Selby at the gas station?
small talk. I told him I was gonna run for lieutenant governor, and he offered to print the campaign flyers, free of charge.
was he the same way in high school?
always... help you with your homework, he'd share his lunch with you, he was just happy knowing that you liked him.
even that thing with Logan, he just did it to be popular.
I've answered all your questions.
I think you should go now.
Jane. Come on. - What?
Oh. Sorry. Very nice to meet you.
your politics are a roiling mess of greed and cynicism, but you have a lovely daughter.
Aw, him again.
I'll take care of it.
Mr. Jane, hello.
Willa, right? Regional TV personality.
Yes.
um, anything I can help you with?
Oh, I'm just here for the big game. Football... I love it!
how goes the investigation?
Oh, my colleagues are pursuing several leads, uh...
nothing definitive yet.
Mr. Jane, this is a weekend of celebration.
your presence is making a few people uncomfortable.
should I go away?
should I leave Selby and Jana unavenged because of some low comfort levels? Is that what you're saying?
no, no.
what are you saying then?
I... Never mind. - Okay.
Willa, I do have a question.
yes?
how are the burgers?
the burg... the burgers are good. Very good.
vice principal Desouza, do you mind if I join you?
wow, look at you. All grown-up.
sit down. Tell me what you've been up to these days.
nice cover. I didn't actually attend this high school.
in fact, I didn't attend any high school.
I'm with the CBI. - Oh, please, please.
these reunions are insufferable.
what I wouldn't give to be home on my couch, glass of wine, good book.
well, I take it you heard about Selby Vickers and his wife.
Oh, yes. That's... That's a tragedy.
Selby was a truly good kid, you know, until that one incident with Derek Logan.
Derek Logan was definitely a different kind of duck.
he wore the same tattered jacket, be it hot or cold, always hugged the wall as he walked down a hallway.
he was off.
"off" isn't tolerated in high school.
well, certainly not in the 30 years I've been doing this job.
right over there is where it all happened.
Derek's folks sent him to a shrink afterwards...
but it didn't help.
a month later, they pulled him out of school.
that was the last I heard of him.
did Selby ever give a reason why he did it?
you know, I asked him, but he just shrugged.
you know, gave me that teenage "i don't know."
how'd you catch him? Derek was blindfolded, right?
Yes. He heard his attacker's voice, though.
he thought it sounded like Selby.
I confronted Selby. He confessed quite readily, like the helpful, honest boy he usually was.
it's very strange.
you want me to memorize everything we have on all 67 alumni that showed up at the reunion?
Yes, I do. - And how would I do that?
it's easy. You build a memory palace.
um, I thought that was just some card player's trick.
well, it's multipurpose.
it's perfect for recalling a large body of information.
all you need is a physical location that you know well, and you break it down in your mind into smaller pieces and link each one to a package of the information, like this.
I walk in the door, and I'm greeted by reunion chair Willa Brock...
former class president, debate team captain, led the team to three county championships, now a talk show host in Chicago.
I sit down at the table and catch up with Dana Greer...
swimmer, now a realtor in Los Angeles, married to a gentleman by the name of Arthur.
and so on and so forth. - Okay.
when you want to remember the details, you close your eyes, and in your mind, you walk around your very own memory palace.
Yeah, yeah, but I-I can't learn all this stuff in just a couple hours.
it comes very quickly once you get the hang of it, and they'll be wearing nametags.
but why? I mean, why would I memorize all these - It's fun.
this is some dubious scheme that Lisbon doesn't know about, isn't it?
Yeah, you can count me out.
sorry, you gotta do it. - Uh, no, I don't.
if you, uh, don't cooperate, I'm gonna be forced to tell Lisbon about you and Van Pelt.
tell what? There's nothing to tell.
Really? - Yeah. I don't know what you're talking about.
contrary to very strict CBI rules and regulations, you and Grace Van Pelt are engaged in an illicit affair.
Nope. - You're being childish.
don't tell Lisbon. She'll report us to HR. - Well, she's a stickler.
they'll throw one of us off the unit. - Better get to work.
if they started the day with this every morning instead of the, uh, pledge of allegiance.
or maybe they could, uh, just integrate the two into the "dance of allegiance."
we're taking a real flier here. This better work.
timpani. - No.
really got me stumped on that one. I'm just guessing now.
look, we'd better get this thing going before people start leaving.
Hey, how's it going?
nice to see you. Long time.
coffee machine.
how goes it with my favorite photo club president?
it goes great. How goes it with you?
it goes whatever's better than great.
you know, I - I forgot your name.
well, it's, uh...Derek logan.
Yeah.
and it's great to be back.
Oh, yeah.
this is gonna be good. I promise.
great to see you, too, man.
Derek Logan. I- I can't believe it. - Yeah, you've changed.
well, who would've thought that the girl who brought four schools to their knees in the high school county debate finals would be lost for words, huh?
you... You just look so different.
let's just chalk it up to 15 years' worth of solid hours at the health club, plus maybe a little bit of work.
you gotta look good in my business, huh? You know what I mean?
had to see it to believe it. Derek logan!
Hey. LJ hey! Refrigerator. - What?
Rancho Rosa versus Stratton...
the ball is on our 10, 2 seconds on the clock, Sims hands it off, bam!
you run 90 yards, touchdown, Toros win.
Oh, you're... You're half right. That was against Deerfield.
and it was a pass, not a handoff, but it was close.
man! That's Derek freakin' Logan!
I'm gonna, uh, make the rounds to say some hellos, but it is great to see you guys.
wow, you're a natural. - I can't do this.
you're doing it. You ready for phase two? - I can't.
think of it this way... You mess up, we blow the case, and I tell Lisbon.
Oh, you're a cold bastard, you know that?
good evening, fellow toros!
now is the part of the evening you've all been waiting for...
the achievement awards!
as voted by you...
the 15th reunion class of Rancho Rosa high!
break a leg. - Yeah.
our first award... The "I can't believe they're still together" award, which goes to...
Dave Mercer and Angie Diaz Mercer.
no surprises there, am I right, gang?
what are you doing? - I'm - a let you finish, Willa.
I, uh, just want to say a few quick words.
okay. Just make it fast, okay? - Sure.
uh, slight change of schedule.
we'll get right back to the awards, but first, Derek Logan!
yo, D!
I'm, uh, sure most of you are scratching your heads, wondering why, uh, why I'm here.
I came here tonight because, uh...
I wanted to see how it felt like to be here again.
I'm not the same person I was 15 years ago, so when I walked in that front door tonight, it felt good.
thank you.
but as soon as I set my eyes on you people,
I remember how it felt the last time I walked out that door, and I was that sad, defeated kid again.
sure, go ahead. Feel sorry for me.
but you should also feel sorry for Selby, may he, uh, rest in peace.
about a month ago, Selby called me.
he'd been, uh, trying to track me down for months, he said.
he wanted to apologize and, uh, to tell the truth about what really happened that day...
the truth that never came out.
you see, Selby was a follower, not a leader, and he did what he did because somebody else was there that day.
somebody told him to do what he did to me.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, Gina, what's up?
he'll be fine. Just, um, uh... Give him an aspirin.
and I now know who it was.
and that is the real reason I am here.
I am here to make you pay.
Yeah, you... You ruined my life, uh, that day.
and I've spent 15 years struggling to get it back.
and now, now I have. Oh, yeah.
and I will have my revenge.
payback is... is... is a bitch, like, uh, in that movie with, um, uh...
uh, mel... Mel Gibson where they... Where they kidnap his child.
um, you know. Uh, or is it the other one?
uh, anyhow, um, that's me. Enjoy the rest of your evening.
go, Toros.
what ar... What do you think you're doing?
Oh, the maid lent us this.
you still should tip her. It's the right thing to do.
must've been hard walking out in the middle of a big event you planned.
the speech was boring, and I have to get back to Chicago.
I have two shows to prepare for on Monday.
I have a great idea for your show.
Uh,"humiliating pranks and the people who initate them."
you could be your own guest.
you... You have no basis for that.
I just... I didn't want to have to hear Derek go on and on about...
your talk show goes national soon.
so?
if Selby had gone to the media with the story of how you brutalized a helpless boy, your big chance would be history.
so you arranged a meeting with Selby to get the money.
Jana showed up with him, which you weren't expecting, so you killed them both.
okay, I-I didn't have to pay him or kill him.
uh, Selby didn't have a stitch of proof putting me in that locker room.
the media would've ignored him as a crackpot.
I have immortal longings in me.
do you remember that quote?
uh, uh, it's shakespeare.
I - I think it was the quote in my yearbook photo.
and an apt one.
high school was a wonderful time for you, wasn't it?
Yeah, you could say that.
star student, class president, champion debater...
you were at the top of the social hierarchy.
Willa Brock was the queen of the school.
your world was perfect.
Yes. - Yeah.
but then something happened and unsettled that perfect world.
Derek Logan irked you, somehow.
and you just couldn't let it pass without a response, so you turned on the charm, you manipulated Selby to do your bidding, knowing that he'd be thrilled to help the popular girl...
the girl he was always a little in love with.
and then you destroyed Derek Logan, to the delight of your peers.
and you enjoyed it, 'cause you found it all so easy and so empowering and exciting, right?
all your success at Rancho Rosa high...
This...was Willa Brock's crowning achievement.
you've aged well.
it looks like Selby took more than one photo that day in the locker room, didn't he?
have a look at that. Check that out.
this is Selby's proof, but you didn't want to pay him all that money and risk him blackmailing you again, so you killed him and his wife Jana.
kinda poetic, how you were done in by your own vanity.
Derek Logan told everyone I let him touch me...
like I ever would.
I was deeply humiliated.
so you ruined his life.
and Selby and Jana Vickers had to die, too.
Selby falls for that little polish girl and suddenly grows a spine?
things would have been perfect if he just stayed lonely and pathetic.
close call. If she'd have destroyed the negative that Selby had given her, we'd have no evidence and no case.
it was a trophy. It was a reminder that the great Willa Brock can crush anyone that dares stand in her way, just like 15 years ago.
Yes, yes. Nobody advances an inch from high school.
you proved your point. - Their instincts never change.
Selby and Derek would both be grateful.
you two have an open invitation if you want to join us at the 20th.
hopefully, we won't need to.
keep it in the dojo, Phil.
one thing I don't get... How did you persuade Rigsby to play this charade?
I told him that you promised to give him monday off.
not happening.
well, that puts me in an awkward position.
I-I-I-I held up my end of the bargain.
Oh, god. I used to love this song.
loved the song. I used to love this song.
you love this song. - Yeah.
obviously, you want to dance.
with you? No.
Oh, come on. You can pretend that I'm that mean, cold-hearted guy that you used to worship from afar, but never talked to.
no funny stuff.
Really?
trumpet?
no.
Mr. Norris, I'm gonna let one of my guys show you the Lamborghini.
it's your new car. You just don't know it yet.
the McLaren looks good on you, Mr. Landau. Not tonight.
a lot of fellas out there.
they've got to sell station wagons, minivans, This?
I don't have to sell this.
this is the good life on wheels, stem to stern.
hell, the trunk's bigger than my first apartment.
Oh, my God.
agent Rigsby, what do we have? - Hey, boss.
Liselle Douglas, salesperson here, age 28.
blunt force trauma, numerous contusions, possible skull fracture.
her clothes are still intact. No obvious signs of sexual assault.
what is it? - I just love that new car smell.
anything on the time of death?
she was last seen working here late last night.
private security did a sweep at midnight, reported the alarm system hadn't been activated.
coroner thinks she was probably dead by then.
let's get the body out of here, see what we can find out. - Yeah, you got it.
that's expensive, huh?
$300, 000 retail. Probably get a discount now, though.
Hey, guys. One of you found the body?
Yeah, James Kinsey. I believe he's in the john right now.
Brad Elias.
any idea who could have done this, Mr. Elias?
no. None. It was horrible. This is a tragedy.
we're like a family here. - Ha! Family.
that's cute. - Excuse me?
you work on commission, right?
sure.
okay, then you're not a family at all. You're a gladiator pit.
you're a seething mass of primal hostility and mistrust.
that's not true.
people have the wrong idea about sales.
there's a lot of respect among us, right, guys? - oh, yeah.
clearly you're a top dog amongst this pack here,
but the question is, who's the fastest runner?
runner?
Liselle's clients are gonna need a new broker, aren't they?
and I think that my associate, agent Cho here, left her client list upstairs. In your break room.
it might be a little ghoulish to grab it up so soon, but it is still up there, and someone, at some point, will...
I've got the client list right here. It's evidence.
what did you do that for?
I have eliminated this man from any suspicion.
too honest to profit from a killing? Too honest to kill.
right? - Right.
Hey, guys, break it up.
unless, of course, you're very cunning and you're working a double bluff.
come on. Take it hey, come on. - No, I didn't think so.
come on. Break it up. Break it up. Come on, guys. Hey.
Liselle didn't show up for work yesterday.
I didn't know what to think. It wasn't like her.
you were worried?
I was pissed. Hosting the party was her responsibility.
it's a good think that Kinsey stepped up.
heard you boys didn't play nice last night. Naughty, naughty.
you like your employees at each other's throats?
you bet I do. This is a job for winners.
we're the top luxury broker in northern California.
we got four floors of stock back there.
we got over $100 million in sales annually. My guys have to earn their place.
so every six months we have a sales drive.
so Top guy on the board gets a titanium diamond Rolex.
bottom guy... gets a new job.
look, agents,
not to press--my clients would like to know when we can reopen. What can I tell them?
you can tell them a woman's dead.
which is terrible, uh, but this is a service business.
and when sharks stop swimming, they drown, right?
no malingering guys.
this is James Kinsey.
Ah, top salesman. Congratulations. - Thanks.
damn right. This guy could sell a cat to a mouse.
Ah, I might have to throw in a few extras to close that deal.
Mr. Westhoff here says you were working with Liselle the night she disappeared.
Yeah, working on last night's party, sure. I left her here about, uh, 8:00, 8:30.
how'd she seem--her demeanor?
fine, I guess. Uh, a little tense, maybe.
a lot of pressure to get that party together.
Hey. Hey. That--that's--that's mine.
that. - Okay.
now how'd you and Liselle get along?
uh, great. She's a great girl.
great? But you resented her.
no. - Yes.
why was that? She was in the middle of the pack, So she was no threat to you.
Liselle did very well for her age.
she did very well because she was beautiful,
and you felt that gave her an unfair advantage.
Hey, sex sells. That's a fact of life.
Oh, yeah.
listen, her actual pitching skills--bush league.
you put a bag on her, Liselle couldn't sell squat.
ever ask her out? - Yeah.
how'd that go for you?
uh, she said no. Boyfriend. - What was his name?
um, uh, Jeff. Jeff somebody-- musician, wannabe rock star.
Yeah, she was always bitching about him. Always drama with those two.
boyfriend is Jeff Sparhawk.
the victim had a loft with him south of Market. Here's the address.
Jane and I will look into it. You check out her financials.
you wanted to see me, boss?
actually, I wanted to see both of you. Shut the door. Sit down.
you know what this is about.
the other day you told me you were involved in a romantic relationship with each other.
Yes.
dating within the unit is strictly against CBI regulations.
I wanted to take some time to think about how to respond, but I realize that it's causing tension, so...
agent Rigsby and Van Pelt, are you involved in a personal relationship with each other?
Yes. - We are.
okay, then.
as your supervisor, I have to report the relationship to employee support services.
I'm gonna do it as soon as we close this case.
do you have any questions?
but they'll make one of us transfer out of the unit.
Yes, they will.
that's the rule. You knew that.
you can go now.
where the hell is 4-B?
I understand your position. There's no need to beat yourself up about it.
what are you talking about?
well, that you feel bad about Rigsby and Van Pelt.
no, I don't.
well, you can't help wondering If there's a hint of jealousy and resentment in your decision.
excuse me?
Mr. Sparhawk?
we're with the California Bureau of Investigation.
california what?
we want to ask you some questions about Liselle.
you want to put down what's left of your guitar?
Yeah. Whatever.
I'll make some tea.
why all the demolition, Jeff?
I'm sad. I like to destroy things when I'm sad.
well, some sadness, but mostly guilt,
a dollop of self-pity,
tingle of excitement.
so you're a musician?
all right. You any good?
no.
you're okay. I could tell Liselle was a woman of taste. She wouldn't have loved a bad musician.
Yeah. I'm great. Huge.
last year I made $9, 000 for my music.
well, that's $9, 000 more than Van Gogh ever made from his art.
Yeah, things worked out for him.
okay. So, um, Liselle was the breadwinner?
Yeah. Her cut on an aston...
could keep us going for a couple months, so I could concentrate on my music.
she did it for me. She hated that job.
did that ever cause tension in your relationship?
sure. Couples fight.
I didn't like her working at that place, but...
you needed the money. It's fair enough.
she was getting hit on all the time by rich egomaniacs, okay?
it's gonna make you jealous, right? Guys, uh, guys try to give her stuff.
what kind of stuff?
you know, uh, jewelry, perfume, stuff like that.
Liselle always sent it back.
Why? - Out of respect for me.
or if she couldn't give it back, she gave it away.
not all of it.
this is very valuable.
Liselle said it was too valuable to get rid of.
she said we'd use it to, uh, pay for our wedding.
who gave her the print?
I've done bad, stupid things.
I never deserved her. And now she's gone. God.
Oh, stop. Self-pity'll kill you.
take it from someone knows.
Jeff sparhawk has no alibi.
you can dispense with the cop talk, Lisbon.
you can tell me what's bothering you.
nothing's bothering me. - Okay.
nothing is bothering me.
message received. - Good.
Sparhawk--no alibi, yeah?
it was nonsense.
yet you recall my exact words.
there's no shame in it.
I feel that way, too, sometimes.
why does everyone else get to have a normal life?
my life is fine.
normally you rise above such craven emotions, but in this case, your hands were tied.
it's the rules. You're forced to do what your worst self is telling you to do anyway.
hence, your tension headache.
I don't...
all right. I-I do have a headache, but that's a coincidence.
Nah.
either I obey the rules or I risk taking big heat for ignoring them.
this is on Van Pelt and Rigsby, not me.
whatever you say.
Lisbon. - Hey, I found something on that print.
it sold at auction in san francisco last year, purchased by Walter Mashburn for 30 grand.
Mashburn. Sounds familiar.
he founded mashburn avionics, sold it ten years ago for billions.
he was also Liselle Douglas' last appointment the day she died.
did you notice the badge, or should I show you again?
I'm so sorry, but I can't say if Mr. Mashburn is here or not.
we're a private club, our members treasure their privacy.
don't worry. I'll find him.
W--excuse me, Sir.
well, hello there.
the deck, corner table?
Oh, you must be new.
Walter Mashburn.
I liked Liselle. Smart woman. Damn shame.
and you gave her an expensive gift.
Yes.
were you sleeping with her?
if I slept with everyone I gave gifts to, I wouldn't get any work done...
or any sleep, for that matter.
but you propositioned her, and she said no.
perceptive.
you're a psychic, aren't you?
what makes you say that?
you have this charlatan air about you.
my second... No, my third wife was into all that mystical go.
you learn to recognize the type.
how many wives have you had?
enough to know better.
but I'm currently unattached.
so were you sleeping with Liselle or not?
not.
that print was a reward for finding me an Austin Healey 2-seater from 1960.
there was only a few hundred made. She earned that gift.
and the appointment you had with her the day she died?
to pick the car up. Do you want to see it?
no, thanks. - I'd love to.
you have a damaged intensity that's quite attractive.
Yeah.
let me buy you a drink sometime.
I live in sacramento. - I have a jet.
Oh, you're very good. Very good.
I have one question-- Uh, did you kill Liselle?
Jake, check, please.
let me show you folks something.
smugglers call 'em go-fast boats--says it all.
nothing like flying across the ocean at 80 knots to get the blood going.
would you like to come for a ride?
we get it. You're an energetic man. You like danger.
so why bring us here?
I have no love for danger.
nothing's dangerous if you think ahead.
if you plan it right, you can get away with...
well, I was gonna say you can get away with murder, but...
you know what I mean.
okay. So... What's the point in showing us your fancy toy here?
this is how I live my life.
I have a castle in scotland, a compound on the waterfront in Marin.
if I killed liselle, would I stuff her in the trunk like some low-rent thug?
how would you have done it?
she would have just disappeared, like smoke, like she was never there.
you enjoy being a murder suspect, don't you?
am I? A suspect? - Of course.
it could be you're a sociopath, or it could be that killing is a thrill that you can't buy.
not a lot excites you anymore, does it, Walter?
Patrick, if you really think I killed Liselle, there's only one thing for you to do.
try and catch me.
that could be you.
Mashburn's got zero priors, but he's been investigated for several shady business deals.
but they never found anything. Legit business genius, it says here.
he thinks he's a genius. He's a pirate that got lucky.
he's gotten everything he wanted since he was 30 years old.
except you. - Wait. Walter Mashburn asked you out?
no.
well, sort of.
Personally,I thought she should have gone for it.
a little empty glamour would have been good for her.
but, no, not our lisbon.
Rigsby, why don't you go and talk to his alibi, the swimsuit model?
Oh, sure, yeah, the swimsuit model. Uh, no problem.
the alibi will be solid, whether he did it or not.
check anyway. - I got something.
it seems Westhoff, the boss at zenith motors.
reported a Ferrari disappeared from their service department the night of the murder.
but an hour later, Westhoff called the sheriff back and said never mind.
so he found the car? - Didn't say.
we need to find out. I got the autopsy report.
Liselle died of major head trauma caused by forceful contact with the pavement.
that put together with skin abrasions, bone fractures...
she was hit by a car.
well, if a car is the murder weapon, it'll have trace evidence on it--blood, d. n.a.-- Even if the killer washed it.
talk to westhoff. D. n.a. evidence doesn't last forever. - Okay.
I'm out sick two days, and you give the Tarlen account to Legler?
you've been sick on and off for a month.
it's not my fault I got a stomach bug. - Hey, no free rides.
you eat what you kill here-- that's rule number one.
don't tell me about rules, you son of a bitch. This is me talking.
Oh, you? - Yeah.
you need to remember which one of us here is the man.
Hey, guys. Are we interrupting something?
management seminar.
traditionally in these dominance displays, it's customary to, uh, bare one's canines.
some species go so far as exposing their genitals.
1986 Ferrari Testarossa
belongs to an Alexa Landau, and it disappeared from your service department.
where is it? - I don't know.
then why'd you tell the cops "never mind"?
cause I told him the owner's husband may have taken the car.
we try not to call the police on our clients.
he stole his own wife's car?
Yeah, Landaus are splitting up.
you know, rich people and their frickin' soap opera lives.
apparently, the husband took the car to vegas, partied hard, left the car a mess.
now Alexa's pissed.
and before she jets off to Milan, she brings it in to be detailed,
specifically tells kinsey not to let her pig husband near it.
he tells me this later.
and you think the husband didn't take no for an answer?
Noah Landau's a big record producer, not really known for his impulse control.
and he loves that car.
Noah Landau was at the cocktail party when Liselle's body was discovered.
I'll talk to Lisbon.
rich people and their frickin' soap opera lives.
you don't really like rich people much, do you, Kinsey?
are you kidding? I love 'em.
I'm on the way up, my friend. Rich people are taking me there.
well, someday, but in the meantime, Landau is dining at some lavish restaurant in Las Vegas.
sitting across the table from him is a woman probably half his age that's laughing at every one of his jokes.
and you're stuck here with this guy, reheating... Beef soup?
Beef--beef barley. Do you mind? - Sure.
would you say you have food issues?
you don't have to answer that. Were you an orphan?
a lot of thieves around here.
Oh, like I'm gonna steal your lunch.
well, someone did. - Yeah, just the other day.
how low is that? - Beef barley?
Beef-- it's not really a popular soup meat, is it?
each his own. - Yeah, I guess.
so he killed her while stealing his own car?
that's the theory.
look, Grace, I just wanna let you know I'm not worried about Lisbon reporting us.
we'll make it work, whatever happens. - I know we will.
if worse comes to worse, they probably wouldn't transfer you out of the central valley.
l. a.or something like that is really unlikely.
well, you're assuming I'm the one to be transferred?
Yeah, I've been here almost five years, so seniority, plus, this is my career, you know?
it's my career, too, Wayne.
no, I didn't mean it that way. Obviously, you can have a career as well.
thanks for your permission.
why would I steal my own car?
Oh, it was your wife's car, Mr. Landau, your, uh, estranged wife?
Yeah, well, we're uh-- what do you call--reconciling.
Congratulations. That's nice.
so the trip to Vegas was a last hurrah?
Yes, we know about it.
we know everything, Mr. Landau.
Liselle Douglas sold your wife that car.
you know her? - Really?
Liselle sold me that car.
86 Testarossa-- frickin' classic.
you think Alexa even cared? She can't even drive stick.
so you took what was yours. That's understandable.
you know what? You should leave. - You killed her, didn't you?
ran Liselle down when she caught you taking the car.
wait a second. Wait a second. That's how she died?
well, maybe you didn't see her until it was too late. It was dark.
help yourself, Mr. Landau. Tell us your side.
Oh, man, it's not like that. It's not like that. Look...
when I got back from Vegas, I, uh, I-I forgot some, uh, stuff in my car.
drugs?
no. Yeah, drugs. What else?
Alexa and I-- we're working out custody of our son.
so you could see how a drug bust could look bad.
well, a place like zenith would never call the police on a client.
of course not. They'd politely leave it in the glove box, where Alexa would find it and have me thrown in prison.
that's why I had to get the car before she found the dope.
so you stole it.
uh, no. I asked someone to do me a favor.
and then I was partying, I lost my phone, I can't get ahold of the guy.
that's why I went to that stupid cocktail party, to try to hook up with him.
he's a salesman? - No, no. It's Liselle's boyfriend.
his name is Jeff Sparhawk. He's got the car.
jumped at the chance to get close to me, so I was...
should have just asked him to kill my wife.
that's a joke.
you guys, man.
excuse me. Mr. Jane. - What?
Oh, sorry. - If you could just-- right over here.
I'm sorry,Mr. Jane. You cannot hang out in the merchandise.
okay. Uh, well, what we need then is a test drive.
down to the beach would be good. - You're looking to buy?
Absolutely. Well, not me, but, uh-- I don't really care for this kind of ostentation,
but cho likes what you're cooking.
do you think you could show us around the lot?
you know, I'm so sorry. Our inventory starts in the low six figures,
so I need a bank statement before I can book an appointment.
otherwise we would be inundated with requests. You understand.
Yeah, of course.
uh, you'd make an exception for a friend, wouldn't you?
no.
okay.
we got a lead on Sparhawk and the missing Ferrari. Gotta go.
uh, could you do me a favor? Could you drop me someplace on the way?
sure.
unexpected pleasure.
what brings you here? - Fishing.
for what? - Whatever bites.
you're not on stakeout then?
what's a stakeout?
there's our car. Where's Sparhawk?
I can't believe he could walk away from something like this in one piece.
that's blood on the air bag. He was in it, all right.
no brake marks. He ran directly into the pole.
put the sword down now.
go ahead!
don't shoot him unless he goes at me for real.
I don't know, boss.
- Boss...
we need to talk. - No.
Jeff... Put that thing down now.
make me. Go ahead and make me!
nobody's gonna shoot you, Jeff...
no matter how badly you want them to.
I killed her. I killed Liselle.
then let's talk about it.
let us help you, Jeff.
put down the weapon.
stand down.
you're under arrest, Jeff.
we're gonna take you to a doctor, have him check you out.
is this it? Is this how you work your magic?
what magic's that?
check out this little puppy. That's a keeper.
you think I didn't check you out?
What'd you find? - Psychic, just as I called it.
Ah, no such thing as psychics.
Oh, I know. You're a charlatan, as I said.
you lost your wife and kid to a serial killer-- your fault, you think
and now you're on this hopeless quest for redemption, battling evil and injustice, right?
close enough. - You play mind games with people,
you size up their weaknesses and then you give them the rope to hang themselves.
Oh, you make it sound so cool.
and as for your work so far on me, I guess you think I'm vain, egotistical and hate being ignored.
do you disagree?
no. It's pretty much accurate.
but I'm also cunning, ruthless, and I hate to lose.
just the kind of man that would kill a woman for rejecting him.
did I?
well, you knew Liselle was stuffed in the trunk. How?
I have a lot of friends-- sheriff's department, mayor's office.
did you kill Liselle Douglas?
you tell me. - I'll know soon enough.
I just need to read you a little more, dig a little deeper into your psyche, if you don't mind.
not at all. Dig away. It'll be fun.
anything for a thrill. - Yes. Pretty much.
Hello?
we brought in the victim's boyfriend. He's looking pretty good for it.
wanna come and have a chat with him?
Yeah, maybe a little later. I'm kind of busy.
where are you?
well, I'm with an admirer of yours, who, uh,
looks very good for it as well, has "killer" written all over his face.
not Mashburn. - Tell her I said hi.
uh, he said hi.
in there. - Hung up.
grace. - Yes?
look, you're giving me frostbite. Can we talk or what?
sure. I guess.
okay, look... I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to say that your job is less important than mine.
I know. It's just...
you're deciding how my career should go?
planning my entire life for me?
it's not like we're married or anything.
grace, I get it. You're right. We're not married.
how stupid would that be, right?
stupid?
Yeah, um, we've only been dating a couple months. Who knows what's gonna happen?
well, sure, but what's stupid about it?
I-I-I-I meant stupid if we got married today.
but what about tomorrow? I mean, long-term, where are we?
do we have to discuss this right now?
Yeah, we probably should have done it before we announced our relationship and I endangered my job.
well, my job's on the line, too. - That's not what you said before.
you have seniority, remember?
look, grace, I know you're scared, but you can't keep blowing hot and cold on me like this, not now.
so what, I should just move to the fresno office and smile about it?
you know what? Fine. Do whatever you want, Grace.
Jeff, we've got the lab rushing the results on the d. n.a. Test on the bumper of the ferrari.
once we find liselle's blood, any leverage you had is gone.
you should plead this out now.
you think I killed her?
it helps that you said so during the standoff.
right. What's weird...
I think if I had killed her, I'd feel better than I do now.
at least I'd feel in control.
so now you're saying you didn't do it?
I didn't. But I did... Metaphorically.
I killed her with my selfishness.
this isn't a lyric-writing workshop, Jeff.
you were there the night she died.
you stole the car at Landau's request and stashed it where?
parking garage?
Yeah. I thought, uh, if this guy gives me a break,
I can finally make it, take care of Liselle for once.
she takes care of me by working her ass off.
my big idea was grand theft auto.
maybe Liselle caught you, tried to stop you.
no. - Maybe it was an accident.
no. She w--she never even saw me. She was working too hard.
I loved her.
if I had killed her, you wouldn't be talking to me,'cause I'd be dead, too.
we need Jane. - Yeah.
the human brain is built in layers.
the homo sapien brain on top of the caveman on top of the animal.
way down, deep below, you will find the lizard brain.
Lizard-- all action and reaction, no subtlety.
you cannot train it to not react.
then where did I hide the ring?
you're telling me.
all the lizard brain knows is that something is hidden and you don't want it found.
you can't hide your reaction.
you're talking a good game, but I am not see my ring.
I'm listening, and the ring... Is...
excuse me. Thanks.
thank you.
voil? - Parlor trick.
Yes, but it gives me a truer sense of your character.
it's quackery. You--you disappoint me.
you think you sweat too much, you have mild dirt phobia, and you have issues with your mother.
who doesn't? Quackery.
if I cared at all about respect, I would say that that is disrespectful.
I just say what I see.
I have to prove you wrong. Do you have, uh, a good fast car available?
I do.
Jane, what are you doing? - Cho. Proving a point.
lisbon with you? - No.
Oh, that's a shame. She'd enjoy this.
she wants you back at the office. - No doubt. You ready, Walter?
I think so. Good.
it's very low. You nervous?
of course not. - Well, you should be. It's a very fancy car.
I don't like the color.
but, uh, what I'm gonna do is steer by feeling your reactions.
you play it cool, we crash.
whatever you do, do not close your eyes. Okay?
okay. All right. Uh, how do I turn it on?
here. - Okay.
Oh,I'll be damned.
that was fun.
thank you. All in the wrist. All in the wrist.
why'd you do that?
it was a total accident.
well, uh... At least no one got hurt.
it was a terrible color, anyway.
I-I'll get you a new one. Sorry.
no traceofoflood or d. N. A. On the stolen car.
nothing? So we have no murder weapon.
and no suspects.
let's start over. Go through every witness statement. Excuse me.
Hey, cho. Oh, no.
Oh, great. No. No, you can handle this one.
just be sure to be clear that the cbi is not liable. He is just a consultant.
uh, long story.
uh, I have to buy Walter a new car.
could you show us what you have?
as I explained, Mr. Jane, we need a bank statement to confirm.
Mr. Jane has assured me on his honor that he's good for it.
so I'll vouch for him.
do you need to see my bank statement? - Of course not.
all right. Well, then let's do this. - Absolutely.
I think we'll have Elias show us around.
but you want the best to help show you around.
Yes, he's second best. He'll try harder.
right? - Right.
shall we?
how out this one here? - Excellent eye. This car.
well, it's gray. I mean, really? Gray?
your car.
no. Gray'd be completely wrong, wouldn't it?
let's take a look at the, uh...
actually, no. Let's go this way. Shall we?
Patrick, we've been this way before. Let's go back.
Oh, please. Be patient.
see, thing is, Walter, no matter how smart a plan you make, there is always someone smarter who will see through it.
makes it very hard to get away with murder.
I like this car shopping. It's a lot of fun.
I think that's your car. What do you think, Cho?
6-speed, pedal shifters. Nice.
Oh, yeah.
it's okay, I suppose. - Try it. I think you'll like it.
I'll take a look. - Mr. Mashburn, may I suggest-- this car--it's...
a little gauche for you.
did you see his last car?
this is a lot better color.
this color symbolizes passion, lust, anger. I think it's lovely.
it does have a little ding down here.
I'm sure they can fix that, right, Elias?
it's a really nice car, but it's had some transmission problems.
V-12, 631 horsepower--much nicer than the one you had before.
you know what? Maybe--maybe we left the first floor a little too soon.
there were some really choice cars upstairs.
but, of course, if this is the car you like, no problem. Of course.
I mean, it's--it's a matter of opinion. I...
you feeling all right? - I'm fine, yes. That's--I'fifi.
he's not fine.
he's feeling squeamish 'cause this is the car that he used to kill Liselle.
I'm sorry. What? - You led us right to it.
I did not. - Yes, you did.
you led us right to it, and how could you do that if you didn't kill her?
that's the most-- that's the most ridiculous...
this car was the hidden ring, wasn't it? - Yep.
and you read Elias' lizard brain to figure out.
so it's over. - Yeah, it's over.
that's too bad. It was fun. - Yeah. How you gonna top that thrill?
maybe next time I'll be the killer.
it's the competition. You have no idea. It eats at you.
second place--first loser.
kinsey was winning another sales drive. It should have been you.
Westhoff likes hustle, so you hustled.
and you made kinsey sick by poisoning his beef barley soup.
only Liselle caught you at it, didn't she?
kinsey had been sick for a while. She figured it out, got mad.
she threw away the soup and said that I had to tell Westhoff what I had done,
told me I had to make this right.
make this right"-- who says that?
self-righteous bitch.
Westhoff finds out I was taking out his top earner, he'd make sure I'd never work again.
and Kinsey? That son of a bitch would call the cops for sure.
security showed up sooner than I thought, so I stuffed the body in the trunk.
it was me or her.
you have to understand that. Someone gives you that choice, you choose you every time.
I'm sure a jury will sympathize.
how did you know it was me?
like I said, you're number two.
number two always tries harder.
that, and nobody steals beef barley soup.
they, uh, told me they're not pressing charges, said I have you to thank.
so, uh, you know, thanks.
just don't screw it up, Jeff.
you didn't tell me. - Excuse me?
that you're together. You didn't say it. I didn't hear you.
there are no rules being broken that i'm aware of.
no holding hands, no soulful looks and absolutely no kissing in the office.
no problem. - Fine.
Hello? Jane? Meet you where?
need a ride?
where did you get that?
Oh, this old thing? Walter Mashburn.
even though you wrecked his car just to get a clean read on Elias?
is that what I did? - Yeah, you'd. Mashburn's not mad?
no. We gave him a new experience.
he helped us catch the killer. This is his way of saying thank you. Get in.
we're not allowed to accept gifts from people.
it's not a gift. It's a lend.
now I know this fantastic restaurant in Napa.
we can be there in about seven and a half minutes.
it'll blow your mind.
it is a pretty nice car. - Yes, it is. Come on.
promise you won't break the speed limit? - Nope.
slow down.
I dare say you've inspected more modern facilities in your travels, but, uh...
Griffin. Don't come in here
Dr. Seberg, what's wrong?
Oh my God.
Hey.
hey?
cheer up. - Why?
uh, 'cause it's better to be happy than sad.
I'm not sad. - You're very sad.
you've been sad for months, ever since, uh...
Oh what, is this some sort of therapy session?
did you bring tissue in case you make me cry?
there we go. Zing of anger... Gets the blood up.
that's a good start.
is this what you came here for, to zing me?
because I've got paperwork to do.
Jane, call for you.
they say it's extremely urgent. Line two.
Ooh.
this is Jane.
good morning Mr. Jane.
my name is Dr. Alicia Seberg.
I gather from a brief research on the internet that you're the best detective in my immediate vicinity.
Oh. Well, um...
you flattered me, but, uh, I'm not actually a detective. - I need your professional assistance. Please come immediately.
I've been murdered.
that was fun!
agent Lisbon! CBI!
ma'am, sir, please follow me.
all right!
agent Lisbon. And you are...
I'm this guy... Patrick Jane. Consultant.
okay, Teresa, Patrick, glad to meet you both.
I'm Dean Harken, California Disease Control Authority.
nice to meet you. - Yeah.
we have a potential code red virus outbreak situation here.
this facility is under C. D.C. A control, as per state emergency protocols，
thousands of people might die if we don't get this right, okay?
we've been apprised of the basic...
now she's denying it, of course, but this situation's almost certainly resulted from an error by Dr. Seberg.
there's no criminality involved, so you're not really needed here.
probably, but we're gonna have...
as a professional courtesy,
I'm gonna let you into the facility.
I'm happy for you guys to observe and gather evidence, as long as you remember that C. D.C. A is big dog here.
our investigation has priority.
now are we cool with that?
Absolutely.
can I see your I. D. also?
sure. - Thank you... Dean.
no picture. That's a shame. You're a good-looking man.
Scott Price, I manage this facility for Zitek Biosystems division.
right off the bat, let me assure you that we as a company are 110% committed to giving you - the best possible cooperation. - Thank you, Mr. Price.
shall we? There's a sense of urgency here.
Ah, yes, of course.
Lisbon, Jane, Dr. Edmunds, head of research here.
he'll take you to the release incident. Price, come with me.
thank you for coming so quickly.
what exactly is it that you do here?
Biowarfare. With modern technology, anthrax, botulism, bubonic plague, even cobra venom all have strong weaponizing potential.
it's a growing field. A lot of exciting developments.
you develop ways of killing people in large numbers.
to the contrary. We develop antidotes, ways to combat the things that kill large numbers of people.
here we are.
follow me.
120
darling. Is this Mr. Jane?
Yes. How are you feeling? - The same.
interesting improvement in cardiac rate, though.
my metabolism's trying to fight back with adrenaline.
good morning, Mr. Jane. - Hi.
agent Lisbon, CBI.
you mind running this down for us?
someone opened this flask and left it under the tank.
it contains an airborne form of cryptohansa B strain.
it's an engineered supervirus.
if it escaped from this room, it would kill every vertebrate creature within a quarter-mile radius.
it attacks the red blood cells, gradually stops them from delivering oxygen.
the victim... dies from suffocation or a heart attack, depending on their physical condition.
we estimate anywhere from two to six hours.
so you could die at any time? - Yes.
Harken says you did this yourself... Tragic error.
he's a bureaucrat. He's looking for the easy answer.
it takes four distinct steps to remove a cap from one of these flasks, and we never open a flask outside of the tank. That's just basic.
I can assure you both, I had nothing to do with this.
but this was no mistake. Whoever did this wanted me dead.
everybody knows I take the first shift.
she called you "darling." You both have wedding bands.
you husband and wife?
Yes.
well, she looks surprised because you seem incredibly calm and cool for a man whose wife is dying.
how would an absence of calm and cool be useful to her?
good point. Correct me if I'm wrong, but for the killer to open the flask, they would have to expose themselves to the virus,
in which case, they would be dying or possibly dead already.
no, there's an antidote.
it's an enzyme compound.
if taken before exposure, it prevents infection.
I assume whoever did this took a dose.
couldn't you j... - No, I can't take it now.
the antidote only works if taken before exposure, as I said.
why didn't you take it before, just as a precaution?
the side effects of regular use are far too severe.
who else had access to the virus flask?
the only people allowed in the lab are Cliff and I,
Welks, Nash and Tripp, our colleagues.
we have a state-of-the-art biometric security system as you can see.
so your husband or one of the three colleagues is the killer.
sorry. Uh, will be the killer. - Jane.
I'm just... Mm.
that's all right. That is the unavoidable conclusion. Yes.
where are the other three now?
Harken is having them fill out an accident report.
we're gonna need to speak to them.
Ooh, this is a good one, eh? - Good?
well, interesting. Unique.
if you're a jaded, ghoulish adventure seeker.
Ghoulish? Listen, if people are gonna kill each other and we have to catch them, I would much rather they go about it with some kind of originality.
boss? - Hey, Van Pelt.
I need you to do background checks on Cliff Edmunds...
Lilith Nash, Griffin Latimer Welks, Florian Eric Tripp.
I'm sending you their details now.
anything to be looking out for in particular?
Oh, uh, one of them released a lethal supervirus that could kill half the state of California, so I guess we're looking for someone with a prior background as an evil supervillain.
okay.
that last part was a joke. - Yeah, we get it.
later.
hello. - Hi.
hello. - Hello.
what are you doin'? - What does it look like I'm doing?
trying to make us nervous? - Correct. How am I doing?
doing well. - Excellent.
but why?
one of you three murdered Alicia Seberg, - or her husband did. It's our job to find out who. - And we're in a hurry.
and nervous people are easy to read.
and what do you gather from all this reading?
well, you're an open book. You're exactly what you seem to be, - a straight arrow, a boy scout. Am I right? - No - I'm wrong. There's a hidden side to you. - Yes, but...
what are you hiding? - Nothing.
what is he hiding, Lilith?
what are you hiding? - I... I'm not...
it was you, wasn't it? - Me what?
you were having an affair with Alicia Seberg.
what? No, not with me. - Not with you. With who, then?
I oversee equipment and inventory, not my colleagues' private lives.
but she was having an affair, huh?
why else would a husband have the motives to kill her?
and if it wasn't her husband, it was one of you.
who was it?
my guess...
Kaseem.
Yes.
does her husband know? - Oh, he knows.
Dr. Edmunds is a kind gentle man. He couldn't have done this.
thank you, Lilith, Florian...
Griffin.
why didn't you tell us you were having an affair - with Dr. Kaseem here? - Because it isn't relevant.
Yeah, we have an honest and open marriage.
they do.
Really? You don't mind?
no, I don't mind at all.
fidelity is silly a cultural convention. - Like clothes and not killing people.
you could say so.
come on. It must bug you a little.
no. We love each other. Her happiness is mine.
it's not like I don't have affairs myself.
are you having an affair presently?
no. I've been far too busy.
y... you must think this is a little weird.
uh... Yeah... At first.
but hey.
but hey.
what an eloquent phrase that is.
Oh! Isabel. Thank God.
mom? Mom, I got dad's message.
is it true?
Yes, it's true.
no.
no, no, it can't be!
Oh, this is a pickle, isn't it?
Oh, baby, don't cry. Don't cry.
how can you tell me not to cry?
of course I'm going to cry. Is there something you can do?
there has to be something!
listen to me.
we don't have much time, so we mustn't waste it, we'll be waiting. Okay?
okay. - Good.
how's school going? Did you get your calculus grade up?
I got a 95 on my last test.
Oh, well done. You keep that up.
and... And what about that boy, Andy? How's that going?
Oh, he's a jerk. I don't see him anymore.
I didn't like the sound of him.
I love you so much.
you're the best thing I ever had and I am so... Proud of you.
mom.
when I'm gone, you mustn't waste time being sad.
a little while is okay, but not too long.
you be brave.
and be happy.
Bye, baby.
mom!
mom! - Bye, baby.
no, mom!
good-bye, my love.
I love you, darling. Good-bye.
she's gone, baby.
she's gone.
she's dead? - Yes.
I'm, uh...
I'm sorry for your loss.
my people and I will get prepped - for the decontamination procedure. - How does that work?
it's a low-intensity micro-radiation bath built in for this eventuality.
the chamber is irradiated. The virus is destroyed.
Alicia's body's not harmed.
how long until we can examine the crime scene? - Whoa.
it's not a crime scene until you know there's a crime, right?
well, you don't know there's been a murder here.
Where's your evidence? - Alicia Seberg's word.
why would she lie? - She had a brain freeze.
she screwed up, and she can't admit the fact.
it happens. I've been working this beat for a long time.
I've seen the same denial, same certainty.
it's human nature. - I disagree. I believe her.
I'm calling this in as a homicide.
and I'm sorry if this complicates your work, - but it's my job. - That's fine. Okay. Doing your job.
but this is still a live outbreak, and I'm in charge here. You wanna make a murder case, we'll deal with the suspects as per C. D.C. A. protocols.
Absolutely.
until the summer of '08,
Seberg, Edmunds, Nash and Tripp all worked together at the Northern California Technology Institute Biochemistry Department.
Seberg and Edmunds left abruptly...
some kind of legal dispute.
okay, Cho and I will check it out.
have you ever been convicted of a criminal offense?
no.
are you now or have you ever been a member - of a terrorist organization? - This is ridiculous.
this is ridiculous. - Just let it go.
let's have some quiet back there, huh?
now, Mr. Tripp, please... - Why?
Why?
what difference does our silence make?
silent or not, you're still wasting everybody's time - with this nonsense. - You guys called this homicide, so now we have - to run the paperwork. That's how it works. - Still a waste of time.
I thought I made the deal clear to you guys.
you really wanna mess with the C. D.C. A?
absolutely not. I apologize for my colleague's rudeness...
no, she doesn't. I retract that apology.
show some mettle, Lisbon. You know as well as I do, if I have ten minutes with these people,
I will get the truth, - if there's any useful truth worth having. - Excuse us.
Yes, excuse us. We have to have a chat.
cool it, all right? That is an order.
okay, just relax. I'm working the case.
let me explain something to you.
this is politics.
the C. D.C. A. is rich, mean and well connected.
the CBI in comparison are like poor orphans.
we can't make enemies out of them.
we need to cooperate with this man.
he irks me. - Say it, "I understand."
hmm. So...
go. Find yourself a vending machine.
buy yourself a candy bar and come back - when you're ready to play nice. - Give me a dollar and I will.
you're paying me back.
carry on.
Oh, my lord. That's terrible.
and you suspect foul play of some kind?
uh, professor, Dr. Seberg and her husband worked here at the institute until '08, as did Florian Tripp and Lilith Nash.
is that correct? - Yes. Brilliant research team.
we were very sorry to lose them.
money, you know? We tried to hold them to their contract, but Zitek threatened a lawsuit, so they left rather under a cloud.
but Edmunds and Seberg as a couple...
did they get along? - Oh, I think so, despite all.
despite all what?
well, uh, I don't like to listen to that sort of gossip, - but, uh, one hears things. - Like?
Edmunds was quite the ladies' man.
he had affairs.
that's why he gets her.
quite drama sometimes.
drama of what type?
fireworks, as it were, you know.
but as I say, I don't pay attention.
anybody you know who did pay attention?
Ah, I believe one of our grad students in the astrophysics department was, uh, involved.
name? - Greta Skye.
how long does this decontamination take?
another hour.
don't touch that, please.
this is a murder investigation. I can touch what I want. You have problem with that?
there's dangerous stuff in here, that's all.
I like what they're doing these days.
they're making regular candy bars, only with dark chocolate.
you tried that? - No.
you... You want a bite?
no, thank you.
all right.
hmm. Really good.
Hi. Can you hear me?
Isabel, right?
who are you?
my name's Patrick Jane.
I'm here to find out who killed your mother.
good. Kill them, please.
Oh, I wish I was allowed to do that.
you know, you should probably step away from your computer.
do you have any friends nearby? - I wanna be with my mother.
Yeah.
I'm sorry for your loss.
do you have a candy bar around at all?
what?
well, we were just talking chocolate, and it occurred to me that chocolate would be good for you.
all that emotion... It wipes you out.
and sugar's good for energy.
my mother is dead.
chocolate and grief is a good combination.
you should try it. It'll taste so much... deeper, more intense.
everything will feel that way for a while.
you'll feel more alive.
you should probably try to hang on to that feeling as long as you can. It's a gift.
I guess.
I want you to do something for me now, Isabel.
I want you to please turn off your computer and go and tell a friend what's happened.
you do that now.
open sesame.
that wasn't meant to happen, was it?
do you have an advanced degree in any of the physical sciences?
Yes.
excuse me. Uh... Sorry to interrupt.
we need to expand the pool of suspects.
the tricky little high-tech scanners let anyone in.
that's nonsense.
try it.
I'll be damned.
see? Same with that door. Anyone at this facility could've gotten to those little virus thingies... Anyone.
who's responsible for the operation of the security scanners?
I have no idea how that could happen. That's outrageous.
it's your job to oversee the security systems here, isn't it?
not the technical aspects, obviously.
that's contracted out, but I'll get right on 'em, give 'em a piece of my mind, believe you and me.
you're showing us your palms. It's a supplicant gesture, suggesting a guilty conscience.
that... That's not valid or relevant.
I'm... I'm simply stating the facts. I have no idea why the security system doesn't work.
the man's right. You're not real convincing.
I regret that's your opinion, - but I... I have no control over that. - Mr. Price, you're under arrest.
for what?
let's see. For one, the murder of Alicia Seberg.
that's absurd.
and frankly, not your call. - Oh, is that right?
Yeah, this homicide investigation is ours.
if we can't get along, I'll call my friends at the FBI, get them to take over from you.
in fact, I will do that. I'm sorry, little lady...
maybe you should step back...
may... maybe I was right about the supplicant palm gesture.
Yep.
I want to talk to my lawyer.
you have that right, but if it doesn't...
have you ever sat in the back of a military aircraft - with a black hood over your head? - No
well, then you got a new experience coming.
because that is where this is going unless you start talking.
right about now! - Um... Look...
quiet.
please.
the contractor screwed up.
the software glitches constantly, so... they're fixing it.
meanwhile, the system's down, temperately.
nobody knew the system was down, so in a way, it worked just as if it was up and running...
in a way. - How long was it down for?
two... Months.
two months! Anyone at all could enter the lab, terrorists, crazies, thieves.
have you any idea how much trouble you're in? - Thieves?
people wanna steal germs?
cryptohansa B strain is a... is a must-have research tool.
it's hard to make.
it's worth $300, 000 a gram in the black market.
Wow. - Isn't that right, Price?
and you left the cupboard door wide open.
you are yea deep in trouble, pal.
you think about your situation for a while.
okay? And we'll talk again.
you know he didn't kill Alicia Seberg.
you just like scaring people, right? - Hey, if there was a murder here, - I think he's a very good suspect. - Why? He has no interest in her death.
it could only lead to discovery of the security breakdown. - We'll see if he had any other motives.
the salient point here is that anyone could have gotten to those flasks, not just Price.
Kaseem could have, for instance, or you could have.
you were already here, weren't you?
for an inventory check?
what time did you get here exactly?
the night before, right? - You remind me.
I was gonna call the FBI, replace you people.
and I was gonna tell you that's not your call.
we're here on the direct say-so of the A. G.
call him. Tell him we're off the case. See what he says. - I might do that.
we'll see how it goes, shall we?
it's time to open the biohazard chamber.
Oh, that sounds fun I'm footing into a biohazard chamber.
shouldn't we be wearing masks or something?
no virus could possibly survive the radiation bath.
the virus inside the flasks are still alive, of course.
but the flasks are unbreakable.
there's no danger.
five flasks intact.
let's get these babies back in deep freeze.
okay. We're copacetic.
let's send Alicia Seberg on her way
doctor, this is a crime scene now. You can't...
let him stay.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
and, Greta, you had a sexual relationship with Cliff Edmunds, the victim's husband, is that right?
no. I mean, yes. It wasn't... Well, yes, I did.
but, I didn't... you don't think I had something to do with killing her? - No ma'am we just looking for insight - into their relationship. - You think Cliff killed her.
is he the jealous type? - Not at all.
did he ever show violence to you?
no, no, Cliff is a very gentle soul, really.
and Alicia's such a cool person.
we heard there was trouble.
no.
well...
there was one incident,
but it had nothing to do with Cliff or Alicia, really.
please continue. - We've been seen each other for a while.
somebody left a note for me, pushed under by door in the middle of the night.
basically, it said I was a whore and I should stay away from Cliff.
it was very ugly. It was anonymous, of course.
who do you think sent the note? - I thought it first was Alicia Seberg naturally.
but it turns out she wasn't even in the country on the night in question.
who's your next best guess?
um, the one time I went to see Cliff at work, there was a lab assistant.
she gave me this glare like a death ray, - and I thought maybe it was her. - What's her name?
Lilith Nash.
the question is why now?
what was it that triggered the killing? What changed?
what's the answer?
well, for one thing, Harken showed up. - You think Harken did this?
Ooh, I'd like that. But what's his motive?
van Pelt.
boss, Cho and Rigsby found an ex-lover of the vic's husband.
she thinks Lilith Nash sent her a menacing note.
interesting. - So I dug deeper.
Nash is clean under her current name but had a brief marriage in Canada in '96, '97.
under that name, Lilith Blaum, in '99, still in Canada, she had a restraining order taken out against her - by her ex-husband and subsequently spent four months in a secure mental institute. - Well, that could happen to anyone.
uh, Van Pelt, could you do me a favor?
could you call Cho and Rigsby and have them get out here - as quick as possible? - Why?
I got a hunch we're gonna need 'em. - Okay.
thank you. - Will do.
let's go talk to Nash. - Meh.
what? I think she's good for it. - Ah, she's nuts.
she's got a nutty little secret crush on the boss, - kills the wife. - Something like that.
she did seem nervous, but why kill now?
and why would she use the virus? - I don't know. Let's go and ask her.
Ugh, if you want to.
you know, you're just resisting Nash because you didn't peg her right away as the one.
no, I'm resisting Nash because, uh, she isn't the one.
but if you wanna go talk to her, let's go talk to her.
but whatever you do, do not tell Harken.
why not? It's procedure.
fig for procedure. He'll stomp all over her.
she'll clam up. You'll get nothing but a waste of time. - I'm telling Harken.
okay.
Nash, come with me.
now.
stand there.
listen closely and please tell the truth.
is there a way out of here that avoids the main gates?
a back way out? - Yes.
where? - Walk a mile north.
there's a culvert that goes under the fence halfway along the northeast property line.
excellent. Now... Tell the truth.
did you ever go by the name Lilith Blaum?
Yes.
did you spend time in a mental asylum?
yes
do you have a secret crush on Cliff Edmunds?
Yes.
did you kill Alicia Seberg?
no.
I believe you, but I know how Harken's thoughts run.
a way to blame you will be found.
I repeat. I know how Harken's thoughts run.
a way to blame you will be found. Do you hear me? - Yes.
excellent.
go.
did Lilith Nash come back in here?
no.
uh, that's odd.
Where's Lilith Nash?
uh, she left with...
you don't need to worry about her.
she's not guilty.
and how do you know that? - Because I asked her. She told me.
Uh-huh. And where is she now? - Um... I don't know.
security.
she's not in her room. She's nowhere to be found.
Oh, you people are overreacting. I'm sure she's no danger.
she's mentally unstable and probably a killer, - but you're sure she's no danger. Well, that's reassuring. - Well, even if she is those things, and I don't say that she is, - then she's done her worst already. - Mr. Harken! We have a code red.
what's a code red? - What? No.
Oh, no.
anyone within a quarter-mile radius of this flask is gonna be dead within the next four to six hours.
but I put the flasks in the safe.
she must have gotten into the safe somehow. - W... H... how is that possible?
what was that?
a beaker fell. - What?
there's only one missing.
that's a relief, anyhow. But how did she do it?
never mind how. She's done it. What do we do now?
well, there's nothing we can do.
in the next four hours, we'll all be dead.
tell me the truth.
this is a trick right?
no. Why would I do something like that?
what would be the point? - Swear on your child's grave.
you know I don't do that, not for anything.
Oh, my god.
this is a drill, right? - Uh, this is not a drill.
this is... This is the real thing. I'm sorry.
listen up.
we have a few hours left.
but we'll keep this virus contained here.
nobody leaves this facility.
and then what? We get buried in the desert?
the air force will drop incendiary bombs on the facility, burn the virus out.
your next of kin will be informed.
like I say, we have a few hours left,
so we all should make our arrangements and say our prayers as best we can.
make your phone calls.
may god have mercy on our souls.
Hey, boss. We're about five minutes from your location.
Cho, listen.
Jane and I have been exposed to the virus, and it looks like we might die soon.
okay. - So I wanna thank you and Rigsby and Van Pelt.
it's been an honor working with you.
I need you to call my brother Tommy.
his number is in my desk diary.
it's under Town and Country Electrical.
tell him that I love him and that I forgive him for whatever and that, um, he needs to make peace with his brothers.
it's my last dying wish. You tell him that.
will do.
okay. Good-bye.
uh, wait. I... I wanted to talk to them also.
sorry.
it's all right.
that's a fine farewell.
I feared that you'd become tearful and incoherent, but no.
succinct.
noble. Bravo.
don't you have anybody you wanna call besides Cho and Rigsby?
no.
and if I were dying, I'd wanna call you, but... You're already here. So there's no need.
me?
hmm?
what would you say?
uh... Wait... Wait a minute. If?
if I was dying? - Yeah, you're not really dying.
I wrote a label and put it on an empty flask, and then I convinced poor Lilith Nash to run away.
I feel kind of bad about it... - You son of a bitch.
but just... Just wait. Just please. Be still. Cho?
this is Jane. Please disregard Lisbon's last message.
I tricked her. My bad. I'm so sorry.
are you at the culvert? Okay, good. Wait.
there'll be some people coming your way soon. Bye.
you're sick.
why would you do this to me?
two reasons. Firstly to catch the killer of Alicia Seberg. The killer who is not poor Lilith Nash.
the killer who, you may recall, took a dose of the antidote in order to survive - exposure to the virus. Yes? - Yes...
the killer who believes that he or she - is the only one that isn't going to die. Yes? - Yes.
so they have to get out of here before we die, or else they'll be burnt to a crisp by the air force.
their hands are tied. They have to try to escape, thus revealing themselves to us with precision and clarity - of a mathematical equation. - And reason number two?
the second and most important reason is doesn't it feel great to get your life back?
don't you feel good right now?
don't you feel happy to be alive?
No!
Oh, I know you do. You know you do.
if reason number one does not pan out very, very soon,
I think I'm gonna punch you in the nose.
forbearance, Lisbon.
any moment now, Harken is gonna come around that corner with an anxious expression on his face because someone has run off.
any moment now.
wait.
any moment.
nothing.
if you just get...
that's what I'm talking 'bout.
Hi.
well, this was all a hoax?
well, "hoax" is a little strong. Uh, more of a ruse, a gambit.
the important thing is we caught the killer.
right? That's what's important. - That's what's important. Griffin Welks, huh?
never would have caught him your way, and my way...
cathartic and life-affirming.
you know what? You're on your own.
okay, the important thing now is to be careful 'cause this is the real thing. Okay?
all right, let's get that back in the deep freeze.
see you around, big dog.
I was siphoning off small amounts of the virus matrix and selling it on the black market.
$300, 000 a gram.
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
I'm in charge of keeping inventory, so it was easy, until Harken arrived to do a spot check, and I had to do something fast, so I spilled a flask to cover up the missing quantity.
knowing full well Alicia Seberg would be exposed.
someone had to be responsible.
I figured everyone would think that she'd opened the flask by accident and couldn't admit to it, 'cause she was like that... couldn't be wrong.
I'm curious. The money you made from your theft...
how'd you spend it? - I didn't.
I have it in treasury bonds mostly, some real estate.
Mm-hmm, that's smart investing.
you'll be the richest man in Folsom.
Whew. Long day.
it's chilly around here. You still angry with me?
Duh.
Oh, confess. You do feel better.
you feel much more alive. I know you do.
you know what made me feel better?
punching you in the nose.
Ah. Glad to be of service.
I dare say you've inspected more modern facilities in your travels, but, uh...
Griffin. Don't come in here
Dr. Seberg, what's wrong?
Oh my God.
Hey.
hey?
cheer up. - Why?
uh, 'cause it's better to be happy than sad.
I'm not sad. - You're very sad.
you've been sad for months, ever since, uh...
Oh what, is this some sort of therapy session?
did you bring tissue in case you make me cry?
there we go. Zing of anger... Gets the blood up.
that's a good start.
is this what you came here for, to zing me?
because I've got paperwork to do.
Jane, call for you.
they say it's extremely urgent. Line two.
Ooh.
this is Jane.
good morning Mr. Jane.
my name is Dr. Alicia Seberg.
I gather from a brief research on the internet that you're the best detective in my immediate vicinity.
Oh. Well, um...
you flattered me, but, uh, I'm not actually a detective. - I need your professional assistance. Please come immediately.
I've been murdered.
that was fun!
agent Lisbon! CBI!
ma'am, sir, please follow me.
all right!
agent Lisbon. And you are...
I'm this guy... Patrick Jane. Consultant.
okay, Teresa, Patrick, glad to meet you both.
I'm Dean Harken, California Disease Control Authority.
nice to meet you. - Yeah.
we have a potential code red virus outbreak situation here.
this facility is under C. D.C. A control, as per state emergency protocols，
thousands of people might die if we don't get this right, okay?
we've been apprised of the basic...
now she's denying it, of course, but this situation's almost certainly resulted from an error by Dr. Seberg.
there's no criminality involved, so you're not really needed here.
probably, but we're gonna have...
as a professional courtesy,
I'm gonna let you into the facility.
I'm happy for you guys to observe and gather evidence, as long as you remember that C. D.C. A is big dog here.
our investigation has priority.
now are we cool with that?
Absolutely.
can I see your I. D. also?
sure. - Thank you... Dean.
no picture. That's a shame. You're a good-looking man.
Scott Price, I manage this facility for Zitek Biosystems division.
right off the bat, let me assure you that we as a company are 110% committed to giving you - the best possible cooperation. - Thank you, Mr. Price.
shall we? There's a sense of urgency here.
Ah, yes, of course.
Lisbon, Jane, Dr. Edmunds, head of research here.
he'll take you to the release incident. Price, come with me.
thank you for coming so quickly.
what exactly is it that you do here?
Biowarfare. With modern technology, anthrax, botulism, bubonic plague, even cobra venom all have strong weaponizing potential.
it's a growing field. A lot of exciting developments.
you develop ways of killing people in large numbers.
to the contrary. We develop antidotes, ways to combat the things that kill large numbers of people.
here we are.
follow me.
120
darling. Is this Mr. Jane?
Yes. How are you feeling? - The same.
interesting improvement in cardiac rate, though.
my metabolism's trying to fight back with adrenaline.
good morning, Mr. Jane. - Hi.
agent Lisbon, CBI.
you mind running this down for us?
someone opened this flask and left it under the tank.
it contains an airborne form of cryptohansa B strain.
it's an engineered supervirus.
if it escaped from this room, it would kill every vertebrate creature within a quarter-mile radius.
it attacks the red blood cells, gradually stops them from delivering oxygen.
the victim... dies from suffocation or a heart attack, depending on their physical condition.
we estimate anywhere from two to six hours.
so you could die at any time? - Yes.
Harken says you did this yourself... Tragic error.
he's a bureaucrat. He's looking for the easy answer.
it takes four distinct steps to remove a cap from one of these flasks, and we never open a flask outside of the tank. That's just basic.
I can assure you both, I had nothing to do with this.
but this was no mistake. Whoever did this wanted me dead.
everybody knows I take the first shift.
she called you "darling." You both have wedding bands.
you husband and wife?
Yes.
well, she looks surprised because you seem incredibly calm and cool for a man whose wife is dying.
how would an absence of calm and cool be useful to her?
good point. Correct me if I'm wrong, but for the killer to open the flask, they would have to expose themselves to the virus,
in which case, they would be dying or possibly dead already.
no, there's an antidote.
it's an enzyme compound.
if taken before exposure, it prevents infection.
I assume whoever did this took a dose.
couldn't you j... - No, I can't take it now.
the antidote only works if taken before exposure, as I said.
why didn't you take it before, just as a precaution?
the side effects of regular use are far too severe.
who else had access to the virus flask?
the only people allowed in the lab are Cliff and I,
Welks, Nash and Tripp, our colleagues.
we have a state-of-the-art biometric security system as you can see.
so your husband or one of the three colleagues is the killer.
sorry. Uh, will be the killer. - Jane.
I'm just... Mm.
that's all right. That is the unavoidable conclusion. Yes.
where are the other three now?
Harken is having them fill out an accident report.
we're gonna need to speak to them.
Ooh, this is a good one, eh? - Good?
well, interesting. Unique.
if you're a jaded, ghoulish adventure seeker.
Ghoulish? Listen, if people are gonna kill each other and we have to catch them, I would much rather they go about it with some kind of originality.
boss? - Hey, Van Pelt.
I need you to do background checks on Cliff Edmunds...
Lilith Nash, Griffin Latimer Welks, Florian Eric Tripp.
I'm sending you their details now.
anything to be looking out for in particular?
Oh, uh, one of them released a lethal supervirus that could kill half the state of California, so I guess we're looking for someone with a prior background as an evil supervillain.
okay.
that last part was a joke. - Yeah, we get it.
later.
hello. - Hi.
hello. - Hello.
what are you doin'? - What does it look like I'm doing?
trying to make us nervous? - Correct. How am I doing?
doing well. - Excellent.
but why?
one of you three murdered Alicia Seberg, - or her husband did. It's our job to find out who. - And we're in a hurry.
and nervous people are easy to read.
and what do you gather from all this reading?
well, you're an open book. You're exactly what you seem to be, - a straight arrow, a boy scout. Am I right? - No - I'm wrong. There's a hidden side to you. - Yes, but...
what are you hiding? - Nothing.
what is he hiding, Lilith?
what are you hiding? - I... I'm not...
it was you, wasn't it? - Me what?
you were having an affair with Alicia Seberg.
what? No, not with me. - Not with you. With who, then?
I oversee equipment and inventory, not my colleagues' private lives.
but she was having an affair, huh?
why else would a husband have the motives to kill her?
and if it wasn't her husband, it was one of you.
who was it?
my guess...
Kaseem.
Yes.
does her husband know? - Oh, he knows.
Dr. Edmunds is a kind gentle man. He couldn't have done this.
thank you, Lilith, Florian...
Griffin.
why didn't you tell us you were having an affair - with Dr. Kaseem here? - Because it isn't relevant.
Yeah, we have an honest and open marriage.
they do.
Really? You don't mind?
no, I don't mind at all.
fidelity is silly a cultural convention. - Like clothes and not killing people.
you could say so.
come on. It must bug you a little.
no. We love each other. Her happiness is mine.
it's not like I don't have affairs myself.
are you having an affair presently?
no. I've been far too busy.
y... you must think this is a little weird.
uh... Yeah... At first.
but hey.
but hey.
what an eloquent phrase that is.
Oh! Isabel. Thank God.
mom? Mom, I got dad's message.
is it true?
Yes, it's true.
no.
no, no, it can't be!
Oh, this is a pickle, isn't it?
Oh, baby, don't cry. Don't cry.
how can you tell me not to cry?
of course I'm going to cry. Is there something you can do?
there has to be something!
listen to me.
we don't have much time, so we mustn't waste it, we'll be waiting. Okay?
okay. - Good.
how's school going? Did you get your calculus grade up?
I got a 95 on my last test.
Oh, well done. You keep that up.
and... And what about that boy, Andy? How's that going?
Oh, he's a jerk. I don't see him anymore.
I didn't like the sound of him.
I love you so much.
you're the best thing I ever had and I am so... Proud of you.
mom.
when I'm gone, you mustn't waste time being sad.
a little while is okay, but not too long.
you be brave.
and be happy.
Bye, baby.
mom!
mom! - Bye, baby.
no, mom!
good-bye, my love.
I love you, darling. Good-bye.
she's gone, baby.
she's gone.
she's dead? - Yes.
I'm, uh...
I'm sorry for your loss.
my people and I will get prepped - for the decontamination procedure. - How does that work?
it's a low-intensity micro-radiation bath built in for this eventuality.
the chamber is irradiated. The virus is destroyed.
Alicia's body's not harmed.
how long until we can examine the crime scene? - Whoa.
it's not a crime scene until you know there's a crime, right?
well, you don't know there's been a murder here.
Where's your evidence? - Alicia Seberg's word.
why would she lie? - She had a brain freeze.
she screwed up, and she can't admit the fact.
it happens. I've been working this beat for a long time.
I've seen the same denial, same certainty.
it's human nature. - I disagree. I believe her.
I'm calling this in as a homicide.
and I'm sorry if this complicates your work, - but it's my job. - That's fine. Okay. Doing your job.
but this is still a live outbreak, and I'm in charge here. You wanna make a murder case, we'll deal with the suspects as per C. D.C. A. protocols.
Absolutely.
until the summer of '08,
Seberg, Edmunds, Nash and Tripp all worked together at the Northern California Technology Institute Biochemistry Department.
Seberg and Edmunds left abruptly...
some kind of legal dispute.
okay, Cho and I will check it out.
have you ever been convicted of a criminal offense?
no.
are you now or have you ever been a member - of a terrorist organization? - This is ridiculous.
this is ridiculous. - Just let it go.
let's have some quiet back there, huh?
now, Mr. Tripp, please... - Why?
Why?
what difference does our silence make?
silent or not, you're still wasting everybody's time - with this nonsense. - You guys called this homicide, so now we have - to run the paperwork. That's how it works. - Still a waste of time.
I thought I made the deal clear to you guys.
you really wanna mess with the C. D.C. A?
absolutely not. I apologize for my colleague's rudeness...
no, she doesn't. I retract that apology.
show some mettle, Lisbon. You know as well as I do, if I have ten minutes with these people,
I will get the truth, - if there's any useful truth worth having. - Excuse us.
Yes, excuse us. We have to have a chat.
cool it, all right? That is an order.
okay, just relax. I'm working the case.
let me explain something to you.
this is politics.
the C. D.C. A. is rich, mean and well connected.
the CBI in comparison are like poor orphans.
we can't make enemies out of them.
we need to cooperate with this man.
he irks me. - Say it, "I understand."
hmm. So...
go. Find yourself a vending machine.
buy yourself a candy bar and come back - when you're ready to play nice. - Give me a dollar and I will.
you're paying me back.
carry on.
Oh, my lord. That's terrible.
and you suspect foul play of some kind?
uh, professor, Dr. Seberg and her husband worked here at the institute until '08, as did Florian Tripp and Lilith Nash.
is that correct? - Yes. Brilliant research team.
we were very sorry to lose them.
money, you know? We tried to hold them to their contract, but Zitek threatened a lawsuit, so they left rather under a cloud.
but Edmunds and Seberg as a couple...
did they get along? - Oh, I think so, despite all.
despite all what?
well, uh, I don't like to listen to that sort of gossip, - but, uh, one hears things. - Like?
Edmunds was quite the ladies' man.
he had affairs.
that's why he gets her.
quite drama sometimes.
drama of what type?
fireworks, as it were, you know.
but as I say, I don't pay attention.
anybody you know who did pay attention?
Ah, I believe one of our grad students in the astrophysics department was, uh, involved.
name? - Greta Skye.
how long does this decontamination take?
another hour.
don't touch that, please.
this is a murder investigation. I can touch what I want. You have problem with that?
there's dangerous stuff in here, that's all.
I like what they're doing these days.
they're making regular candy bars, only with dark chocolate.
you tried that? - No.
you... You want a bite?
no, thank you.
all right.
hmm. Really good.
Hi. Can you hear me?
Isabel, right?
who are you?
my name's Patrick Jane.
I'm here to find out who killed your mother.
good. Kill them, please.
Oh, I wish I was allowed to do that.
you know, you should probably step away from your computer.
do you have any friends nearby? - I wanna be with my mother.
Yeah.
I'm sorry for your loss.
do you have a candy bar around at all?
what?
well, we were just talking chocolate, and it occurred to me that chocolate would be good for you.
all that emotion... It wipes you out.
and sugar's good for energy.
my mother is dead.
chocolate and grief is a good combination.
you should try it. It'll taste so much... deeper, more intense.
everything will feel that way for a while.
you'll feel more alive.
you should probably try to hang on to that feeling as long as you can. It's a gift.
I guess.
I want you to do something for me now, Isabel.
I want you to please turn off your computer and go and tell a friend what's happened.
you do that now.
open sesame.
that wasn't meant to happen, was it?
do you have an advanced degree in any of the physical sciences?
Yes.
excuse me. Uh... Sorry to interrupt.
we need to expand the pool of suspects.
the tricky little high-tech scanners let anyone in.
that's nonsense.
try it.
I'll be damned.
see? Same with that door. Anyone at this facility could've gotten to those little virus thingies... Anyone.
who's responsible for the operation of the security scanners?
I have no idea how that could happen. That's outrageous.
it's your job to oversee the security systems here, isn't it?
not the technical aspects, obviously.
that's contracted out, but I'll get right on 'em, give 'em a piece of my mind, believe you and me.
you're showing us your palms. It's a supplicant gesture, suggesting a guilty conscience.
that... That's not valid or relevant.
I'm... I'm simply stating the facts. I have no idea why the security system doesn't work.
the man's right. You're not real convincing.
I regret that's your opinion, - but I... I have no control over that. - Mr. Price, you're under arrest.
for what?
let's see. For one, the murder of Alicia Seberg.
that's absurd.
and frankly, not your call. - Oh, is that right?
Yeah, this homicide investigation is ours.
if we can't get along, I'll call my friends at the FBI, get them to take over from you.
in fact, I will do that. I'm sorry, little lady...
maybe you should step back...
may... maybe I was right about the supplicant palm gesture.
Yep.
I want to talk to my lawyer.
you have that right, but if it doesn't...
have you ever sat in the back of a military aircraft - with a black hood over your head? - No
well, then you got a new experience coming.
because that is where this is going unless you start talking.
right about now! - Um... Look...
quiet.
please.
the contractor screwed up.
the software glitches constantly, so... they're fixing it.
meanwhile, the system's down, temperately.
nobody knew the system was down, so in a way, it worked just as if it was up and running...
in a way. - How long was it down for?
two... Months.
two months! Anyone at all could enter the lab, terrorists, crazies, thieves.
have you any idea how much trouble you're in? - Thieves?
people wanna steal germs?
cryptohansa B strain is a... is a must-have research tool.
it's hard to make.
it's worth $300, 000 a gram in the black market.
Wow. - Isn't that right, Price?
and you left the cupboard door wide open.
you are yea deep in trouble, pal.
you think about your situation for a while.
okay? And we'll talk again.
you know he didn't kill Alicia Seberg.
you just like scaring people, right? - Hey, if there was a murder here, - I think he's a very good suspect. - Why? He has no interest in her death.
it could only lead to discovery of the security breakdown. - We'll see if he had any other motives.
the salient point here is that anyone could have gotten to those flasks, not just Price.
Kaseem could have, for instance, or you could have.
you were already here, weren't you?
for an inventory check?
what time did you get here exactly?
the night before, right? - You remind me.
I was gonna call the FBI, replace you people.
and I was gonna tell you that's not your call.
we're here on the direct say-so of the A. G.
call him. Tell him we're off the case. See what he says. - I might do that.
we'll see how it goes, shall we?
it's time to open the biohazard chamber.
Oh, that sounds fun I'm footing into a biohazard chamber.
shouldn't we be wearing masks or something?
no virus could possibly survive the radiation bath.
the virus inside the flasks are still alive, of course.
but the flasks are unbreakable.
there's no danger.
five flasks intact.
let's get these babies back in deep freeze.
okay. We're copacetic.
let's send Alicia Seberg on her way
doctor, this is a crime scene now. You can't...
let him stay.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
and, Greta, you had a sexual relationship with Cliff Edmunds, the victim's husband, is that right?
no. I mean, yes. It wasn't... Well, yes, I did.
but, I didn't... you don't think I had something to do with killing her? - No ma'am we just looking for insight - into their relationship. - You think Cliff killed her.
is he the jealous type? - Not at all.
did he ever show violence to you?
no, no, Cliff is a very gentle soul, really.
and Alicia's such a cool person.
we heard there was trouble.
no.
well...
there was one incident,
but it had nothing to do with Cliff or Alicia, really.
please continue. - We've been seen each other for a while.
somebody left a note for me, pushed under by door in the middle of the night.
basically, it said I was a whore and I should stay away from Cliff.
it was very ugly. It was anonymous, of course.
who do you think sent the note? - I thought it first was Alicia Seberg naturally.
but it turns out she wasn't even in the country on the night in question.
who's your next best guess?
um, the one time I went to see Cliff at work, there was a lab assistant.
she gave me this glare like a death ray, - and I thought maybe it was her. - What's her name?
Lilith Nash.
the question is why now?
what was it that triggered the killing? What changed?
what's the answer?
well, for one thing, Harken showed up. - You think Harken did this?
Ooh, I'd like that. But what's his motive?
van Pelt.
boss, Cho and Rigsby found an ex-lover of the vic's husband.
she thinks Lilith Nash sent her a menacing note.
interesting. - So I dug deeper.
Nash is clean under her current name but had a brief marriage in Canada in '96, '97.
under that name, Lilith Blaum, in '99, still in Canada, she had a restraining order taken out against her - by her ex-husband and subsequently spent four months in a secure mental institute. - Well, that could happen to anyone.
uh, Van Pelt, could you do me a favor?
could you call Cho and Rigsby and have them get out here - as quick as possible? - Why?
I got a hunch we're gonna need 'em. - Okay.
thank you. - Will do.
let's go talk to Nash. - Meh.
what? I think she's good for it. - Ah, she's nuts.
she's got a nutty little secret crush on the boss, - kills the wife. - Something like that.
she did seem nervous, but why kill now?
and why would she use the virus? - I don't know. Let's go and ask her.
Ugh, if you want to.
you know, you're just resisting Nash because you didn't peg her right away as the one.
no, I'm resisting Nash because, uh, she isn't the one.
but if you wanna go talk to her, let's go talk to her.
but whatever you do, do not tell Harken.
why not? It's procedure.
fig for procedure. He'll stomp all over her.
she'll clam up. You'll get nothing but a waste of time. - I'm telling Harken.
okay.
Nash, come with me.
now.
stand there.
listen closely and please tell the truth.
is there a way out of here that avoids the main gates?
a back way out? - Yes.
where? - Walk a mile north.
there's a culvert that goes under the fence halfway along the northeast property line.
excellent. Now... Tell the truth.
did you ever go by the name Lilith Blaum?
Yes.
did you spend time in a mental asylum?
yes
do you have a secret crush on Cliff Edmunds?
Yes.
did you kill Alicia Seberg?
no.
I believe you, but I know how Harken's thoughts run.
a way to blame you will be found.
I repeat. I know how Harken's thoughts run.
a way to blame you will be found. Do you hear me? - Yes.
excellent.
go.
did Lilith Nash come back in here?
no.
uh, that's odd.
Where's Lilith Nash?
uh, she left with...
you don't need to worry about her.
she's not guilty.
and how do you know that? - Because I asked her. She told me.
Uh-huh. And where is she now? - Um... I don't know.
security.
she's not in her room. She's nowhere to be found.
Oh, you people are overreacting. I'm sure she's no danger.
she's mentally unstable and probably a killer, - but you're sure she's no danger. Well, that's reassuring. - Well, even if she is those things, and I don't say that she is, - then she's done her worst already. - Mr. Harken! We have a code red.
what's a code red? - What? No.
Oh, no.
anyone within a quarter-mile radius of this flask is gonna be dead within the next four to six hours.
but I put the flasks in the safe.
she must have gotten into the safe somehow. - W... H... how is that possible?
what was that?
a beaker fell. - What?
there's only one missing.
that's a relief, anyhow. But how did she do it?
never mind how. She's done it. What do we do now?
well, there's nothing we can do.
in the next four hours, we'll all be dead.
tell me the truth.
this is a trick right?
no. Why would I do something like that?
what would be the point? - Swear on your child's grave.
you know I don't do that, not for anything.
Oh, my god.
this is a drill, right? - Uh, this is not a drill.
this is... This is the real thing. I'm sorry.
listen up.
we have a few hours left.
but we'll keep this virus contained here.
nobody leaves this facility.
and then what? We get buried in the desert?
the air force will drop incendiary bombs on the facility, burn the virus out.
your next of kin will be informed.
like I say, we have a few hours left,
so we all should make our arrangements and say our prayers as best we can.
make your phone calls.
may god have mercy on our souls.
Hey, boss. We're about five minutes from your location.
Cho, listen.
Jane and I have been exposed to the virus, and it looks like we might die soon.
okay. - So I wanna thank you and Rigsby and Van Pelt.
it's been an honor working with you.
I need you to call my brother Tommy.
his number is in my desk diary.
it's under Town and Country Electrical.
tell him that I love him and that I forgive him for whatever and that, um, he needs to make peace with his brothers.
it's my last dying wish. You tell him that.
will do.
okay. Good-bye.
uh, wait. I... I wanted to talk to them also.
sorry.
it's all right.
that's a fine farewell.
I feared that you'd become tearful and incoherent, but no.
succinct.
noble. Bravo.
don't you have anybody you wanna call besides Cho and Rigsby?
no.
and if I were dying, I'd wanna call you, but... You're already here. So there's no need.
me?
hmm?
what would you say?
uh... Wait... Wait a minute. If?
if I was dying? - Yeah, you're not really dying.
I wrote a label and put it on an empty flask, and then I convinced poor Lilith Nash to run away.
I feel kind of bad about it... - You son of a bitch.
but just... Just wait. Just please. Be still. Cho?
this is Jane. Please disregard Lisbon's last message.
I tricked her. My bad. I'm so sorry.
are you at the culvert? Okay, good. Wait.
there'll be some people coming your way soon. Bye.
you're sick.
why would you do this to me?
two reasons. Firstly to catch the killer of Alicia Seberg. The killer who is not poor Lilith Nash.
the killer who, you may recall, took a dose of the antidote in order to survive - exposure to the virus. Yes? - Yes...
the killer who believes that he or she - is the only one that isn't going to die. Yes? - Yes.
so they have to get out of here before we die, or else they'll be burnt to a crisp by the air force.
their hands are tied. They have to try to escape, thus revealing themselves to us with precision and clarity - of a mathematical equation. - And reason number two?
the second and most important reason is doesn't it feel great to get your life back?
don't you feel good right now?
don't you feel happy to be alive?
No!
Oh, I know you do. You know you do.
if reason number one does not pan out very, very soon,
I think I'm gonna punch you in the nose.
forbearance, Lisbon.
any moment now, Harken is gonna come around that corner with an anxious expression on his face because someone has run off.
any moment now.
wait.
any moment.
nothing.
if you just get...
that's what I'm talking 'bout.
Hi.
well, this was all a hoax?
well, "hoax" is a little strong. Uh, more of a ruse, a gambit.
the important thing is we caught the killer.
right? That's what's important. - That's what's important. Griffin Welks, huh?
never would have caught him your way, and my way...
cathartic and life-affirming.
you know what? You're on your own.
okay, the important thing now is to be careful 'cause this is the real thing. Okay?
all right, let's get that back in the deep freeze.
see you around, big dog.
I was siphoning off small amounts of the virus matrix and selling it on the black market.
$300, 000 a gram.
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
I'm in charge of keeping inventory, so it was easy, until Harken arrived to do a spot check, and I had to do something fast, so I spilled a flask to cover up the missing quantity.
knowing full well Alicia Seberg would be exposed.
someone had to be responsible.
I figured everyone would think that she'd opened the flask by accident and couldn't admit to it, 'cause she was like that... couldn't be wrong.
I'm curious. The money you made from your theft...
how'd you spend it? - I didn't.
I have it in treasury bonds mostly, some real estate.
Mm-hmm, that's smart investing.
you'll be the richest man in Folsom.
Whew. Long day.
it's chilly around here. You still angry with me?
Duh.
Oh, confess. You do feel better.
you feel much more alive. I know you do.
you know what made me feel better?
punching you in the nose.
Ah. Glad to be of service.
he's in the pool house. Name's James Smithson, British citizen.
he's a high-priced tutor for local kids. Daughter of the homeowner's one of the students.
couple months ago they let him move in here.
Rigsby, can you find out why the coroner's not here?
Yeah, sure.
who found the body? You?
she was coming in for a lesson.
she called her dad. He called me.
why us exactly?
I don't know- - what the hell, Vic?
you were supposed to call me the second they got here.
excuse me, sir?
this is a crime scene.
it's my place.
can you do that for me?
I'll expect a full report.
that's why I called you.
old California money, lots of clout. Local P. D. won't cut it. He wants the best.
coroner's on his way.
a single gunshot. No weapon.
don't worry. It's a visual inspection. Didn't touch a thing.
no sign of assault or robbery?
real fancy résumé, this guy.
graduated from Eton and Oxford.
last employer was some hotshot prep school back east.
meh, I wouldn't be so sure.
excuse me? - The facial scar.
eton boy gets a cut on his head, and he needs a plastic surgeon, he gets a plastic surgeon.
my guess-the whole résumé is a fairy tale.
excuse me? - You're excused.
well, I'm wrong then.
no blisters or calluses on his hands. A lot of dirt under his fingernails.
who is this guy? - It's a long story.
anything else? alarm.
yeah .
I got the call at 3: 35 I was at a client's residence nearby, working an alarm upgrade.
arrived here at 3: 52.
body was still warm, so I guess the time of death was a good hour before that.
what - Guess again.
it's calledlazarus syndrome.
guy's heart somehow caughtan electrical charge and restarted. Hey, it happens.
alive?
well, if you can call that living. He's brain-dead.
with no oxygenfor more than ten minutes, there's security cameras out there. Have bandino show youthe footage.
maybe we'll get lucky and catch a look at the shooter.
I need to go and talk to the little girl who found the body.
you got it.
what are you looking for?
the dirt under his nails smelled like rosemary.
Yeah.
whatever was inside this box killed our man.
well, the case is practically closed.
there's no reason to be snarky.
it was my wife Jolene, really.
she saw how much James helped Lanie with her schoolwork, and when she heard.he needed a place to live, she rented the pool house to him.
I don't know. A couple of months, maybe.
very generous of your wife.
Jolene has a big heart.
is this her?
my muse. - Good-looking.
she turned me into a real artist.
before I met her, I was taking snapshots.
banks, we're gonna need to talk to your daughter.
sorry Lanie's too upset to talk at the moment.
please. Maybe later. -We need to speak to her when her memory's fresh.
she saw what you saw.
she came home, went to the pool house.
we're gonna have to hear that from her.
and she found a dead body. She's 12 years old. Don't-don't you get it?
it's a project about the pyramids.
I can talk to you. - Thanks, Lanie.
sit right here, sweetie.
I'm agent Lisbon, and that's Patrick Jane.
Hi. What do you have to do for the pyramid project?
describe the afterlife as depicted in the ancient Egyptian mythology.
Ah, as depicted in the ancient Egyptian mythology.
well, did you know that they believed that when you die, you are carried into the next life on the back of a sacred hippopotamus? That's true.
what time did you get home from school? - A little after:
what did you do? - I made lemonade.
James loves my lemonade.
who else was home?
uh, I was at the gallery, and Jolene was at the gym.
Mr. Banks, please. - No one was here.
I took the lemonade to the pool house.
I saw so much blood.
did you see anybody or hear anything? Voices? A car?
just james.
I'm taking her upstairs now.
does anybody know what was inside this?
no. Are we through? - Almost.
Lanie, why didn't your mother want you to speak to us?
she's not my mother.
honey, it-it's okay.
I was protecting her. She's been through a very traumatic experience.
Oh, I thought you were worried she was gonna say something about whatever it is you're trying to hide from us.
how dare you? - Really? How dare I?
is that the best comeback you've got?
you're gonna let this man insult me? - Huh?
stand there with your mouth open like a moron.
baby. baby Really?
well played. - Yeah. I'm starving.
hopper Banks's Home Studio
we've got four cameras in the backyard.
we ran the footage from sunup till we got here.
check this out.
we found this at 2：37: Watch the window.
wh-what camera had the door?
this is the only image we've got.
nobody coming in or out or in the yard?
whoever shot Smithson knew where those cameras were placed and how to avoid 'em.
if you want one, I can make one for you.
we need to check Jolene and Hopper's Alibis.
you know, hold on a second. None of these cameras are hidden. Anyone can see 'em
guests, students coming here for tutoring, their parents, everybody - Good point. - Thanks for your time, Mr. Bandino.
thank you. Cheers.
the victim, James Smithson, doesn't exist.
passport's fake. His references are bogus.
I ran his prints through all the databases. There's nothing, nothing at all.
your friend Bandino didn't do much of a background check.
that's not like him.
he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer, do you think maybe he's holding something back, - yeah, i'll check it out. - Take van pelt.
just stop worrying. It's gonna be fine with the new boss.
I mean, sure, there'll be a settling-in period when she probes your psyche for weakness, - but once that's out of the way- - would you stop? You're being so childish.
I think you're the one who's nervous.
let me think about that.
it's definitely you.
I'm gonna go talk to Smithson's regular students and their parents, fill in some of these blanks.
good idea. Take him with you.
come on.
Blankman Residence Citrus Heights, California
my god. It's so terrible. Do you have any idea who did it?
we're still investigating, mrs. Blankman.
now the parents and students we've talked to all say he was a great tutor, but not much else.
how well did you know mr. Smithson?
not that well.
I'd drop off, pick up. You know, say hello. He seemed nice.
e- excuse me, mrs. Blankman. I-i'm sorry. Don't mean to interrupt.
I'm a little parched. Could I bother you for a cup of tea?
I didn't offer you- - oh, n-n-no, please. I-i can get it. You're shaking.
would you like a cup? Cho? - No, thanks.
your son never mentioned anything? Money problems? Anything unusual?
they just studied.
smelled so good, I went and made you one.
lemongrass, my favorite.
Yeah, it's funny how smells work. They attach themselves to such specific memories.
you know, like the, uh, kitchen of a childhood home, or having a cup of tea with a lover.
Yes. - Yes.
Yes, you and James were lovers.
Yes.
Oh, you might not want to drink that. That's a little... Funky monkey.
what kind of background check did you do, Vic?
the usual. I checked his well, James Smithson isn't James Smithson.
well, there's a limit to what I can do, you know? I'm not the CIA, here.
Aw, come on, man. You used to be more gung-ho than that.
that's why I'm not a cop anymore. It's too stressful. Unhealthy profession.
Yeah, no kidding.
Hey, you got anything?
seriously, you hear about Hank Harrison?
39 years old, years out from his pension-- boom. Heart attack.
a wife, two kids.
he had that, uh, that bachelor party, remember?
uh, no.
Aw, come on. Sure you do.
the stripper was all over his case, I'm telling ya.
I bet she was.
are you two, like, uh-- are you dating each other?
no, we're not.
no. Because you both looked a little weird just now.
no.
we're talking about a murder here.
Yeah. Yeah, hey, look, I'm sorry, all right?
uh, there is one thing.
a couple months ago, Hopper was working on this photo thing.
he, uh--he asked me to get him a gun.
old-fashioned piece, like the FBI was using in some 's movie he saw.
like a . 38?
Yeah, I guess. We never got to that. I turned him down.
told him if he wanted it like the movie, get a prop gun.
I don't know what he did in the end, - yeah, it is.
Thanks, man. Appreciate it. - Hey, absolutely.
thanks for your help.
Yeah, no problem. Hey, listen.
what say you and me go get a cup of coffee some time?
no, thanks.
I'm a nice guy, right, rigs?
see ya later, Vic.
so Smithson was a big ladies' man, and they've both got solid alibis.
Maggie Blankman's husband's been in Reno for the last three days, and Maggie was at a therapist's session from 2 00: to 4 00: p. M.-- double session.
Jane and I are gonna go to Hopper's gallery, ask about the gun.
want a coffee?
no, thanks.
so what was her name? - Who?
the stripper.
we could double-date-- me and Bandino, you and your stripper.
that's mean. - Kidding.
Oh, her name was, uh, Kandy.
Kandy with a "k."
do I own a gun? - Yes, mr. Banks, a . 38.
have you ever been in possession of one or owned one?
I never had a gun, any kind.
I don't believe in them.
you're just not trying hard enough.
I am.
you just can't read minds.
you close your eyes, okay? I'm the boss here.
concentrate.
swirl. Huh?
vanilla. Pay up.
that's not funny.
Yeah, it is.
Hey, dad, just getting ice cream.
okay.
uh, would you mind taking a polygraph test?
no. Why would I do that?
I'll give you this, Hopper-- you have a very consistent vision.
a little crazy, but consistent.
I wouldn't expect you to understand what I'm doing.
let me give it a shot.
you enjoy taking possession of your wife, but only on camera, not in the flesh.
you were being cuckolded by James Smithson, and you let it happen. Why?
Impotence? Masochism?
homosexuality? I'm not sure.
that's very perceptive, mr. Jane.
you have a talent.
I do. Thanks.
it's an easy call.
you're very attractive but unhappy and accustomed to using your sexuality as a weapon.
did you use your sexuality as a weapon against him?
go.
what does it take to get you mad, hopper?
that's ridiculous! - What's wrong?
uh, these people were just leaving.
Yeah, we should leave. - Let's go.
okay. How's the ice cream? Yeah. - good
hard to beat vanilla.
I know, I know.
you were making stuff up to get the guy angry blah, blah, blah.
the truth is, you just didn't like the guy.
well, that would be very unprofessional.
um, could you take the next left, please?
okay. Well, what did you read? Did he do it?
take the next left, and I'll tell you.
well? - Well, maybe.
he had a good motive.
and maybe not. The red box didn't fit.
you picked up a tail?
nothing.
you sure?
excuse me.
why are you following us?
following you?
shoot, I thought California was friendly.
I'm just trying to make a sale here--life insurance.
cute young couple like yourselves, now you've gotta think about the future, right?
you got kids yet?
disguised British, yes?
you gotta work on your glottal stop.
his what? - his glottal stop.
can we see some identification, please?
I'll--hold on, i'll get it.
put your hands on the car.
now.
what's this about?
turn around.
you ask them to show you theirs first.
unless, of course, you're trying to hide something.
quite right. Quite right, mr. Jane.
who are you?
inspector Francis Slocombe.
scotland yard special branch.
thank you.
I can't reach your contact at Scotland yard.
time difference. Tricky one, that.
Yep, Francis Slocombe, registered at the Flamingo hotel.
Where's jane? - Here.
did you check Liverpool's score?
up -nothing. End of the first half.
excellent.
where are the cucumber sandwiches?
I'm being nice to him, because I think he might know what was in oh, - what about our search warrant - you're not even a bit curious?
after your performance at the gallery, banks made some phone calls.
now judge withers won't sign the warrant.
sorry. Uh, she's a little cranky.
did his story check out? - no
about James Smithson-- his real name's Oliver Stans.
nine months ago he stole an extremely valuable artifact from the british museum
a pristine example of greco-roman art circa B. C.
a wedding ring, said to belong to cleopatra, given her by mark Antony.
that's what was in the box.
here's a copy from the museum gift shop.
stans lifted the ring and replaced it with one of those.
what was he doing in the united states?
he knew we were building a case against him.
changed his name, disappeared.
a week ago we picked up chatter that a dealer in stolen antiquities was gonna buy the ring here, had sent someone to pick it up.
may i?
go-to courier in the high-end stolen art market.
I followed him here to stans and the ring, but I arrived too late.
that's why I was following you.
Anglet has the ring now, and I need to get back on the trail.
you're not going anywhere until your story checks out.
whoever killed Stans killed him for the ring.
slocombe to an interrogation room.
sit on him while I make a call.
sure.
let's go.
James Smithson is Oliver Stans.
a few minor arrests-- narcotics possession charge, assault.
looks like a bar fight.
and yes, a person of interest in the British the hospital called.
they need someone to sign off on organ donation.
Stans' mother was a single parent.
died three years ago. No siblings.
Cho, come with me. We need to ask slocombe some questions.
his gun's gone.
I'll get a search started.
Ron, nine months ago when the ring was lifted, he went off the reservation.
he's been tracking Stans ever since.
you think he helped with the robbery , no, slocombe's just trying to get the ring back.
"why?" is the big question.
you two, go to his motel room. See if you can find anything there that'll help us.
okay.
I got a grid search started.
this is perfect. It's perfect.
agent lisbon.
madeleine Hightower.
special agent Hightower, welcome.
thank you. - This is Patrick Jane.
the famous mr. Jane.
good to meet you.
you, too.
I thought I'd have a nice, quiet day today, but it seems like there's trouble.
we lost somebody.
we're looking for him.
then I'm sure you'll find him.
let's talk in my office. Give me a half-hour to roll some calls.
Yes, ma'am.
she likes you. I can tell.
I've stayed in worse places.
that's shocking.
very firm.
you wanna try it?
Oh, come on.
we can lock the door. Nobody's looking. Come on.
we're on duty.
Yeah, I know. Totally wrong.
come on. What?
hold that thought.
what you got?
Eureka.
now does that mean you can get back here?
Yes, it could be, but unless the critical evidence self-destructs in less than ten seconds, i suggest you get yourself back here.
it's critical.
fine. Room's good. Thank you.
come in.
ma'am, I assure you, today's incident is not at all indicative of the unit's overall confidence.
you had a bad day, agent Lisbon.
you screwed up.
it happens.
now let's get to the work.
this judge, the one who changed his mind about giving us our search warrant judge withers, ma'am.
he's kinda like a stubborn old bull
won't budge once he takes a position.
and he changed his mind because?
he said we hadn't met the threshold.
not what he said.
the real reason.
Patrick Jane insulted Hopper Banks, Jane has unusual methods, but-- he closes cases, yes, he does.
we cannot afford to lose him.
it's you that's in a tricky spot.
ma'am?
this bureau has seen some tough times lately.
my mission is to turn that around and make the CBI the premier law enforcement agency in this state.
Patrick Jane is a huge part of that goal.
if you can't keep him in line, we'll find someone who can.
Yes, ma'am.
you can go.
I'll give judge Withers a call, get you a warrant.
hey boss
according to the information Slocombe dug up, Louis Anglet doesn't just deal in stolen antiquities.
he's a hired gun, never indicted, but a prime suspect in three kills.
he's still here.
multiple i. D.S, multiple arrests, but no jail time.
he looks good for it.
we don't even know where Anglet is.
what we do know is that every time Slocombe opens his mouth, he lies.
in the meantime, let's just pursue the case we're developing.
hopper Banks is still our prime suspect.
let's check out his house for the gun.
we don't have a search warrant.
we do now.
Hightower got Withers to sign off on it.
Hey. - Hey, about the gun did you find anything?
if you did, I hope you keep my name out of it - go away, Mr. Bandino.
nothing so far.
I got some more guys coming.
agent Lisbon, what is the CBI equivalent of Siberia?
because whatever it is, that's where you're going.
hold that thought, mr. Banks.
look what I found in the home office.
it's a picture of a colt, detective special,
caliber, four-inch barrel the same kind of gun killed our victim.
Aprop.
why don't we sort out which one at our offices, mr. Banks?
Oh, Oliver, you idiot.
you bloody idiot.
who's that?
come out or I will shoot.
uh, I checked for you.
liverpool lost.
bad season, huh?
injuries.
you're expecting me, then?
nice work.
Oh, you dropped everything, you risked your whole career to, uh, find him before your colleagues at the yard.
you followed us after he was shot.
you're both Liverpool fans.
he's family.
your son?
Yeah.
my son.
I was no father to him.
never married his mother.
never spent time with him at all, really.
but I kept track.
I tried.
and look at him now.
look at my boy.
he was a brilliant young man.
from nothing, under his own steam, he got himself a scholarship to cambridge to study classics.
that's what got him invited to preview the museum's new collection.
and he stole the ring.
that was an impulsive act.
he's not a thief.
he's a foolish, rebellious kid.
he took a copy of the ring in with him.
it wasn't an impulsive act.
it was a plan.
he's not a thief.
you believe that, and that was your plan.
if you could just talk to him,
as you say, not a thief.
I could have.
if I made it in time, I could have done that.
and now you track down his killer and kill them.
Yeah, well, you know how that works.
I read all about you, mr. Jane.
I know what happened.
well, you'll end up in prison.
maybe.
but right now i'm gonna walk out of here, and you're gonna let me.
you're holding a gun, and I have no real reason to stop you.
thanks for being sensible.
it's my middle name - Hey - hey I'm having a private word with everyone here to kinda set the tone.
cool. It's, uh, an excellent practice.
have a seat. - Thank you.
told her how deeply I value your contribution to the bureau.
nice to hear.
I told her you're too good to lose to some smart-ass move you might make that turns bad.
I told her that if and when it happens, it's her neck.
you're golden.
you're safe for anything short of murder.
you mess up, she's out of here.
any questions?
not that I can think of right now.
good.
thank you for your time.
I look forward to working with you.
likewise.
thank you.
see you around.
I knew the purchase was illegal.
I just didn't want to get in trouble.
ironic.
I haven't seen it since the shoot, which is what, like six weeks ago?
I thought it might be somewhere in my studio, but you guys would have found it, i guess.
that's not very credible.
it's the truth.
boss? - Yeah.
I was going through the files on Banks' laptop, and I found this and this in his telephone records.
Cho, you mind?
all yours.
banks, do you know anything about the theft of a ring at the British museum?
Cleopatra's wedding ring, supposedly.
no.
Why?
we checked your browser history on your office computer.
you looked up the theft of the ring two months ago, right after you let Stans move into your pool house.
downloaded quite a bit about it.
I never did this.
you also made several phone calls to a man named Louis Anglet who we believe may have purchased the ring.
I've never heard of him.
the calls are in your phone records.
I paid for overnight delivery.
and it's not here yet.
well, if it gets here by then that'll be fine.
thank you.
van pelt brings hope.
uh, we've been tracking this Anglet guy via cell phone.
off that, we got a bead on his credit card.
the thing is, someone else is tracking his purchases as well.
has to be Slocombe.
this afternoon, Anglet has a massage booked at the blue willow spa, right here in downtown Sacramento.
slocombe will show up.
so good.
I got Anglet.
bottle of water, please.
I see Slocombe.
Anglet? - What?
got a question for you.
Oh, sorry, I think you have the wrong guy, but--hey.
did you kill my boy? - No.
did you kill my boy?
get off me!
CBI! On the ground!
Slocombe! Slocombe, drop the weapon!
drop it!
I saw red.
I'll end up in prison, just like you predicted.
very foolish.
no.
it's human nature.
Ah, it made me realize revenge is not for me.
pointless.
more violence is just more violence.
doesn't make anything any better.
mm, maybe.
to London tomorrow morning.
take it, and there'll be no charges pending.
thank you.
I don't want to see you again.
clear?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
thank you.
uh, th-that's mine.
Yep.
Francis Slocombe, the man who was trying to kill you, why was that?
I have no idea.
we know that Slocombe was tracking you.
we know that you came here for the ring.
this ring must be very important.
everyone here seems to be talking about it.
what kind of ring is it?
agent Lisbon.
excuse me.
Yeah, well, there's a reason why he hasn't been in jail.
that's his attorney.
probably gets about $1500, an hour.
let's spend a little time with him, run up the meter.
excuse me. I'm agent Lisbon.
would you come to my office with me, please?
just up here.
Hi.
you don't look like my lawyer.
I'm not gonna answer any more questions.
no more questions.
you're too smart for that.
but what you did do is you bought Cleopatra's wedding ring from his killer.
Oh, the Cleopatra?
queen of the nile, the bride of mark Antony?
and here's what you got $39 fakies.
considerably more if you have to get the overnight delivery.
not your fault.
no reason to think it was a fake, obviously.
stans did steal the ring.
that's why it's such a great scam.
he can sell the same ring over and over.
now the person you bought the ring for I'm guessing they paid more than $39 for it.
how much did they pay for it? Huh?
$200000?
more?
more than $200000?
I think they're gonna be pretty mad when they find out it's a fake.
what do you think?
Oh, man.
your attorney's waiting.
see you.
you stay. - Oh, I'm staying.
the phone and internet evidence suggests that Hopper killed Stans for the ring and sold it to Anglet.
Yes, it does suggest that.
so you just put Hopper in a great deal of danger.
Nah.
nah?
that's your considered reply?
Yep.
put a guard on Hopper asap.
will do, boss.
you know, this is exactly the kind of scenario we talked about.
didn't think we'd get there so soon.
you butt is on the line, agent Lisbon.
what did you do?
paid way too much for overnight delivery.
I'll put a team together, sir.
full protection /, my best guys.
banks, you don't understand
sure, I know you people convinced Anglet that I cheated him, and then turned him loose to kill me.
Yeah, that's--that's pretty much how it goes.
but for the record, agent Lisbon had absolutely nothing to do
a-and we could have held Anglet if you were man enough to admit selling him the ring in the first place.
that's it. Get out.
you better pray nothing happens to my family.
Oh, come on.
where is it?
I want the real ring now.
what are you talking about?
I gave it to you.
you sold me the fake.
I want the real one now.
I gave you the real one, all right?
trust me.
I put a gun in that guy's face.
there's no way he'd hand over a fake.
put the gun down! Drop the gun!
all right, all right, all right.
Hey, what did i do?
all right, relax.
on the ground!
put your hands on your head. - Let's see your hands.
up against the truck, Bandino.
go! Go! Let's see your hands.
Victor Bandino, you're under arrest for the murder of Oliver Stans.
Yeah, you think being a cop's stressful?
try being a cop in prison, jerk.
I know my job.
I do good background checks.
I found out that Smithson was really Stans, found out about the ring.
I approached him. We talked.
he couldn't sell the ring. It was too hot.
but I know some people who know some people that put me in touch with Anglet, and that was it.
I brokered the deal.
why'd you kill Stans?
he changed his mind.
didn't want to sell it.
at the last minute, the idiot wanted to confess, return it to the museum.
what was I supposed to do?
you shot him.
I had no choice.
it was a spur of the moment thing.
right.
no premeditation, no death penalty.
the only thing?
you planned ahead.
you planted the phone and internet evidence on Hopper Banks.
that doesn't look good.
right. Agents?
ma'am. - Agent hightower.
Yeah. All right.
narcotics needs help getting intel on a meth house in the southwest.
I said I could spare two of you.
sure. We'll get it.
van Pelt and Cho.
what's the job?
it's hard to believe there's intel in these.
there should be. It's dripping on my feet.
Hightower knows about Rigsby and me.
noticed that. - She knows, but she hasn't said anything.
why do you think that is?
no idea.
if you could guess. - I wouldn't.
I can't stop thinking about it.
that's just gonna get you in trouble.
can you help me?
can you help me?
what happened to you?
I lost my shoe.
can you tell me where I am?
I'm--I'm gonna call this in, all right?
ma'am. Ma'am. - Can you...
okay. All right. We're gonna get you some medical attention. Come on.
okay - Come over here and sit down.
okay. - What's your name?
ma'am? Ma'am?
she said she can't remember who she is, where she came from or what happened.
no I. D. Nothing on her at all.
Where's Lisbon?
she's on her way.
E. M. T. S think the bullet grazed the victim's head.
I thought we should talk to her here.
she lost her shoe, so she couldn't have walked far.
the crime scene's probably nearby.
good thinking.
so should we wait for Lisbon or... - Nah.
I'm patrick jane. How you doing?
my head hurts. I don't remember who I am.
hold my hand.
I'm gonna try and help with the pain.
okay, I want you to concentrate and let the pain flow out through your arm and into my hand.
just let it flow, like water.
Ah, I can feel it.
can you feel that? - Yes.
can you feel it flowing? - Yeah.
the pain is flowing away.
tell me your name.
don't reach.
just wait for it.
I can't.
Ah, That's okay. That's okay.
what were you doing this morning, before you got hurt?
I can't. - It's okay. Don't worry.
tonight, then, before my friends found you, what were you doing?
I-I was in a room.
it's cold.
can you see anything?
it's--it's too dark.
were you sitting in a chair or were you lying down?
lying down. - On the floor or on the bed?
on the floor. There's...
dirt and straw.
it makes me cough.
what does it smell like?
horses.
that's fantastic.
Yeah. We're looking for a stable.
Yeah.
her shoe.
Yeah, that's her shoe.
okay. Okay. All right.
guys, there's a light switch right here.
the bullet creased her skull.
it didn't fracture the bone, but a hit like that can knock you around something wicked.
she could have been unconscious for a while.
shooter probably thought she was dead and dumped her with the other bodies.
what about the amnesia?
I don't know what to tell you.
retrograde amnesia usually recedes with time, but I don't know how fast that'll happen.
okay, what I want you to do is just focus on the queen.
here's the lady.
now you saw where she is.
there's the lady.
okay. Now tell me...
Where's the queen?
wrong. First boy you ever kissed.
I don't know. - What's your first name?
I don't know. I'm sorry.
look, there she was. She was always there. Right in the middle.
and the point being?
Oh, I'm just making sure she has amnesia, which, by the way, you do.
it's hard to lie when you're thinking about something else.
great.
we're checking our missing persons database, then we'll run your prints.
something'll probably come up.
find somebody to come in and print her. - Okay.
agent hightower.
morning, Lisbon.
as soon as it's practical, I want to see you, Van Pelt and Rigsby in my office.
I've been meaning to address this issue for a while, but there's been so much coming across my desk, I haven't had the time.
first off, neither of you is denying you're in a sexual relationship?
are you?
no. - No, ma'am.
you work together, you develop feelings. Nothing wrong with that.
but you know very well it's against CBI rules, and like I tell my kids, rules are rules.
if you want to stay together, that's your choice.
but one of you has to transfer out of the unit.
if you both want to stay in the unit, then you can't be together.
that's what it is.
give me your decision tomorrow at the latest.
questions?
no, ma'am. - No.
okay.
Lisbon, stay a moment.
why didn't you handle this situation yourself?
I won't defend what I did, ma'am
I understand these two sneaking around, but you're their superior.
I expect more.
I'll be writing a corrective memo.
that's it. Thank you for your time.
I don't want to talk about it.
Cho, where are we with the victims?
I verified the two I. D. s we found at the scene.
Janine and Mitchell Langham from Chico, both in their 50s, no family in state.
neighbor said that they were hiking in Kasten state forest.
that's 100 miles from where we found them.
well, what about the third victim? - Same as the Jane Doe.
no I. D. of any kind.
the coroner says he's in his early 20s. I put his prints into the system.
van Pelt, did you get any hits on them?
van Pelt? - Uh, I'll check. I'll check.
the coroner thinks that they were shot with a high-powered rifle the Langhams up close, our Jane Doe and the unidentified male from a distance.
do either of the Langhams have a record? - No.
I think we can set the Langhams aside.
Yeah.
the first two victims were shot from a distance, I. D. S were taken.
two victims were shot up-close.
I. D. S were not taken.
clearly, the first two victims were the targets.
and when the Langhams roll up to the scene, wrong place, wrong time.
killer shoots the Langhams, freaks out. Doesn't bother to take their I. D. S.
doesn't even notice that one of the first victims that he shot was only wounded.
we got a hit on the male victim's prints.
his name's Leonard Railton, native American, lived on the storm river reservation.
that's right next to the state forest.
Oh, he's been in and out of the system since his early teens
mostly small stuff, a couple of drug busts.
no family listed.
his emergency contact is his parole officer.
go and go show Jane Doe a picture of Leonard and the Langhams. It's worth a shot.
okay. - You guys check out the trail that the Langhams were hiking.
it sounds like something's going on up there.
let's go talk to Railton's P. O.
there's no point in hiding your frustration with Hightower.
I mean, sooner or later, you're just gonna explode with suppressed rage.
with any luck, you'll be next to me.
well, that's what I'm worried about.
grace. You okay?
sure. No. You?
this is a good thing, okay? No more sneaking around.
we get to decide what we wanna do.
do we know what that is?
let's just get through the day, and then tonight, we'll open up a bottle of wine and we'll talk, okay?
Yeah. Sounds good.
I love you. - I love you.
I thought Leonard had a chance, you know?
good kid.
really trying not to repeat old mistakes.
how long were you Leonard's parole officer, Ms. Brinton?
a little over a year.
he have any family we should speak to?
no, Leonard didn't have anybody.
but his mother was Shoshone, grew up on the reservation.
that's why I got him to move there after he was released.
why the reservation?
Leonard needed people in his life who cared about him. He could get that there.
it's a small community-- not too well-off, but tight.
do you live there?
my father's clan is from there. I'm shoshone.
Shoshone, uh, with a New York Italian/Irish thing going on, if i'm not mistaken by the accent.
is that from your mother's side?
I'm not the first person who needed time to figure out who she was.
were there any indications that Leonard was doing anything illegal?
no. He had some problems when he first got there, but about six months ago, he settled down, got a job, had a girlfriend in the valley.
what was her name?
I met her a couple of times.
no record.
good influence, I thought.
is this her?
uh... no, I don't know this woman.
positive?
I said no. - I got it.
does Leonard have any friends on the reservation we should talk to?
you're going on the rez? - Yeah.
will the tribal police be with you?
Oh, they're aware of the investigation. We'll keep them in the loop.
I should go with you.
Oh, that's not necessary.
as far as some of them are concerned, you're foreigners-- foreigners with badges.
you won't get anything.
I'll get my coat.
excellent.
well, we got ourselves a native guide. - Yes.
Janine and Mitchell Langham.
ring any bells?
no, but I don't really meet people unless they're in trouble.
well, these people got into trouble.
been any reports of crime on the trails? Robberies, assaults?
no, just, you know, raccoons, birds, deer, rattlesnakes, bear.
well, i don't think a bear shot four people with a high-powered rifle.
no, bears can't do that.
their neighbor said the Langhams would've walked the morning star trail.
morning star is not one of our more popular trails.
Exsese me Tisdale, stand by one.
look, I gotta go. I gotta go up the hill there. We have an animal control issue.
well, we need to check out that trail.
okay, uh... okay, the trail head is right over there.
you just stay on the path.
when you get to the fork, you go to the left, okay?
just stay to the left. You'll be fine.
got it. Left. Thanks.
I don't recognize any of them.
take your time. Think about it.
I have.
these people are all dead, right?
Yes.
there's one piece of good news.
you're not there.
how is that good news?
it means you're not a criminal... or you're a very, very good one.
how's it going with the, um... missing persons thing?
well, no one's filed a missing persons report fitting your description yet, - but I'm sure it's just a matter of time. - You don't know that.
look, you had a job to do, and you did it. Thanks
you don't have to stay.
okay.
Thanks.
I've got a lot of time invested here, but if she leaves, we're into is whole sexism thing of whose job is more important.
like I said, it's complicated.
no, it isn't. - What?
which do you want more-- your job or Van Pelt?
what? It--it's not that easy.
sure it is. This is the fork, right?
no, we--we took the fork.
no, I don't think that was the fork. I think this is the fork.
well, whatever. Go left.
it's not that simple. - Job or Van Pelt.
the relex center's the community gathering spot.
Leonard used to come here.
this is Joseph Silverwing.
he helped to settle Leonard in here.
he's on the tribal council.
Joseph, these are the detectives from CBI, I called you about.
we're instigating the murder of Leonard Railton.
can you tell us anything about him?
he's a good kid. Worked hard. Stayed out of trouble.
we heard he had a job.
down at, uh, Markham Willis's place.
it's a souvenir shop just off the reservation.
was Leonard having any problems? - No.
did you hear about any arguments or fights? - No.
money problems? Health issues?
no.
you're right. You really are opening things up here.
do you know about any relationship he was having off the reservation maybe?
no.
nice shot.
did you guys know Leonard Railton?
I'll take that as a yes.
I'm trying to find the person who killed him.
do you want to help me with that don't all speak at once.
who's gonna talk first?
we don't talk to po-po.
Po-po?
I like that.
but I'm not po-po. I'm a po-po consultant.
how about this?
I bet that I can sink a ball before your best player can, and he can have three chances to my one, and if I lose...
50 bucks. Huh?
but if I win, you tell me about Leonard.
we got a deal? Great.
who's your sharp shooter?
it's you, isn't it, shorty?
let's do this.
okay. - All right.
first ball in wins.
you get three chances.
I get one. - Okay.
and by the way, that girl you're crushing on, the one in the blue sweater
it's never gonna happen. She's into the tall guy.
good luck.
my money's on the kid.
one.
two. Last time. Good luck. Lucky last.
that's three.
there's a hole in that ball.
here's the hard part.
schooled ya.
okay, so, uh, what was Leonard's story?
he had money.
a lot of it.
always had the newest kicks.
since when? - Like, six months ago.
well, I heard he had a job.
Oh, yeah.
at Willis's souvenir shop?
that's pennies. - Oh, yeah.
Leonard had money.
any idea where that might have come from?
he wouldn't say.
but he has out in the woods all the time, so... we figured, you know?
yes?
everybody knows what goes on in the woods.
Oh, sure. The woods.
Yeah, this is not the trail.
it's over here. - Are you sure?
I thought I saw it or here.
water tank?
Cho? - Yeah?
there's a pot plant here.
actually, there's a whole bunch of pot plants here.
it looks like a farm.
Oh, yeah which means there's probably some bad guys with gun no bars. So much for backup.
there's only one shooter.
you draw fire, ready?
nice... two... one... two... three go.
Rigsby! Clear!
got it!
it's the kind of farm you find all over public lands
about an acre of plants, irrigation pipes everywhere.
did you hit the shooter? Maybe he's in a hospital.
didn't see any blood. I doubt it.
do you think the ranger knowingly direed you toward the pot far was this a setup?
it's hard to say. We got pretty turned around. I'm not exactlsure we were on the trail.
Where's the ranger ? - Up in the mountains.
supervisor says he's out of calling range.
find out when he's back.
so it looks like Leonard Railton was working for the pot farmers.
there's a hundred ways that would turn ugly.
Meh. If Leonard was farming the weed, he would've told his friends about it.
which takes the investigation?
well, we haven't spoken to the girlfriend yet.
so go do that.
you two talk to narcots. See if there's a line on marijuana players in that area.
you heard what she said.
we weren't living together or anything, just hanging out.
so Leord isn't the baby's father, Ms. Hopwood?
kai's father? No.
Oh, yeah. I know, hoy.
but Leonard liked yo little boy, didn't he?
sure
Leonard bought most of the toys her and this, uh... enormous stack of infant formula.
Yeah, like, 1,000 bucks worth.
what's the story with that?
well, it's because Kai got this rash.
it was going around, you know? A couple of kids had it.
he had this idea it was the powdered formula.
he made me throw althe powdered out, which is crazy,'cause it's chear, and it's real easy to use.
all l usually do is add water.
how's the rash now?
all gone.
I guess he was right.
you weren't surprised to hear about leonard, were you?
I mean, you--you cared for him, but you weren't startled to learn that was dead.
he had money, and not from that lame souvenir store job.
he wouldn't tell me where he would gettin' it.
my experience is, that means trouble.
your best guess?
whatever else he was doing... he--he was always good to me and kai.
he was a good man.
you find who did this.
will do everything we can.
Mr. WIllis, how long was Leonard working here?
uh... I guess about six mont.
I hired him on Dolores Brinton's recommendation.
he was a great kid, good worker.
Oh, yeah. At's what I'm talking about.
pretty great, huh? This is fantastic. D-do you deliver?
as a matter of fact, we do. - All right.
U heard me. - Now.
okay. - Now!
all right.
we think that, uh, Leonard was getting money from other place else.
any idea what that was about?
no. He never said a word about it.
what was he doing? - We're still working on that.
special law enforcement discount.
you're not self-conscious about peddling our own culture, are you?
this is not my culture.
this war bonnet is from the Laguna people.
it has nothing to do with us Shoshone.
it'sind of a pastiche, really.
but that's what you Americans want to buy, so that's what I sell.
thank u for your time, mr. Willis.
Jane - I'll meet you outside.
is there some kind of service for Leonard?
tomorrow afteron, I believe.
at's such shame.
I'm gonna take that.
and I like this one, too. It's really beautiful.
I'll see if I can get a tune out of that. Just love those feathers.
grace, hi. It's jane.
how's it going with Jane Doe there?
she get a clue yet?
mm, didn't think so.
you know, bring her down to the office.
I think we're gonna have to get a little more interventionist.
grace, quit hovering.
all right? She's fine.
I took her out of the hospital, Jane. She's my responsibility.
I get that, but she's fine. Ar't you?
what are these?
Oh, these are pictures of where you're from.
I don't know where I'm from.
sure you do.
I'll lay money on the fact that you're a local.
U have roots around here.
you visited places like this as a kid.
one of these pictures here will mean something to you.
I get nothing from that.
what about this? Hmm?
grace, a minute?
Oh, sure. I'll be right back. - Okay.
this?
just relax. Don't work so hard.
look at that.
have you ever seen a more beautiful, more peaceful place?
it would be cool if could just say the word, and you could be in there, listening to the birds sing... the wind rustling through the trees...
the water lapping against the shore.
if I could just say the word.
Wayne, this couldn't wait?
this is so simple.
I love you... more than--more than this job, more than anything.
you got shot at today. You're pumped full of drenaline.
no, no. Well, yes, but that doesn't matter.
I know what I want to do.
I, uh... I talked to a guy in the San Francisco office today.
there's an opening in the major crimes unit.
it's only hour and a half away.
you mean it? - Please, let's just do this.
I don't care where I work.
I-I want you.
you really mean it?
Yes, yes.
Really?
now?
ranger Tisdale should be off the mountain in an hour, so... his bank records say he's depositing 2 and a month over and above his salary-- cash.
let's go talk to him.
I was gonna call you. I just heard.
pot farm.
doesn't that beat everything?
Yeah, right in your own woods. - Yeah.
I've been hiking these trails for eight years.
I have no idea.
I don't know where you ended up, but you must've gotten seriously turned around.
2 th--I don't know what you're talking about.
you're gonna have to come with us.
nice work.
felt good.
send you to the farm?
I was trying like hell to keep you away from it.
all you had to do was stay on the trail.
is that really so hard?
so you were taking money from the pot dealers to protect their farm, right?
they were pang me to direct tourists away and let me know if there were any local cops or feds snooping around.
but that's it. Okay, these people who got killed--I never even saw them.
I need the names of the people who paid you.
I can'do that.
look, these aren't happies growing weed in the forest, okay?
these are serious, serious men.
if they learn that I gave up their names, they'll kill me.
look, they know you've been arrested.
they think you're ging them up right now.
now with these men walking around, you're in danger. Give us their names, and we'll lock them up.
no, I can't.
it's your call.
U got a family?
uh, yeah. - Well, I suggest you send them somewhere.
not out of town-- get 'em out of state.
know anybody on the east coast?
no. - That's too bad. How about oversea?
that's a first-rate interviewer you got there.
thank you. - Hey, what's up?
so Rigsby and Cho tell me there was only one dude with a gun.
that doesn't seem like much.
no, it's not.
so when you say,"these are not hippies, these are serious, serious men,"
that implies many scary men with large guns, right?
Yes. - So why just one?
I don't know. They might be low on money.
I mean, the--the crop is doing badly.
plants are dying? - Yeah, yeah.
and the word is that it's been going about six months, and nobody can figure it out, and they're really kind of freaking out about it.
I'm sure. - Jane?
ye?
I think I gott - I gotta go. I'll see you later. Thank you.
so what'd you get from the guy?
the pot farmers didn't kill Leonard.
that so? - Yep.
you certain?
well, certainty is the mother of fools.
so all this is just... Guess work with you?
pretty much. I mean, that's-- that's what i do, i guess.
for instance, I guess that you're married.
I'm wearing a ring.
well, I guess that you're married, but not happily.
not that there's divorce proceedings in place, but...
possibly a trial separation. - Guess I shld've put up a photo, huh?
I know you're not giving me relationship advice, so I have to wonder why you would go there.
I guess it's your way of expressing unhappiness.
mm, could be.
I gues it's your way of saying you' unhappy with the way I'm handling Lisbon.
we spend a lot of time together.
and when she's unhappy, uh, I'm less happy, it's human nature.
Yes, it is.
I'll tell you at, Patrick.
why don't you let me handle my business my way and then judge me by the results?
that sounds fair.
up to a point.
Yeah, very fair. We done?
no. Please don't interrupt interrogatio.
it's rude. - That's rule, is it?
guideline.
I'll keep it in mind.
now we're done.
loving those pumps.
thank you. - Bye.
Oh, what's this?
interesting. We need to take amnesia girl to the reservation.
meet me the parking lot in ten minutes.
why take her to the reservation?
they're holding a memorial for Leonard Railton. She should be there. She might remeber something.
worth a try, I guess.
Oh, do me a favor. Hmm?
don't mention that to Lisbon or Hightower.
and why not?
well, why complicate things? - Complicate how?
hell, Van Pelt, you shouldn't have taken her out of the hospital in the first place.
your car, parking lot ten minutes.
Mr. Jane, what are you doing here?
well, we're here to pay our respects.
so okay. We won't eat much.
Leonard had only been with us a short while, but if you see him walking a trail up at the lakes or riding a horse, u could see at he was home.
so remember the old words.
when a friend dies, we should not cry.
we should not hate someone or fight.
we should do right always.
and we should listen to the old words and remember Leonard.
if anyone else has something to say... - oh, I would.
this woman was with Leonard when he was shot.
she has lost her memory.
so we brought her here to see if a face or a place or anything could help her remember who she is.
this is kind of a sacred moment. Is this really the time?
it'll take a second.
anything?
no
never mind. The trip was not entirely wasted.
I was also looking at all of you to see if anyone recognized her.
and it seems to me that somebody here does know this woman and that somebody is you, sir.
me?
I think you're mistaken.
prove it.
how?
look into my eyes and hold this.
now tell me you don't know her.
I don't know this woman.
okay.
um, um, okay it appears that I mistaken, which is very good for you.
that elimites you from our inquiry.
my apologies. Cayon. We'll just take our seats in the back.
thank you.
and, listen, if you-- if you d't want us here, then just say the word and we'll go.
just say the word.
I think it would better-- I see it.
I see it! I see it! I see it! I see it.
now just relax, breathe and tell us what you see.
there's a blue lake... pine trees.
a mountain... there's a bird singing.
tell us what's happened at this lake.
it's where the bad thing happen.
what bad thing?
go look. They... they left something on the shore.
who did? - Go look. They left something. They left something.
I'm sorry.
okay, show's over.
come on.
watch your head.
so Mr. Silverwing is gonna complain to our superiors in the strongest terms. Nice work.
see, that's why I didn't bring you along-- deniability how did u know we were here?
I had little tiny G. P. S. trackers sewn into all your suits.
wait a second there, I almost believed you.
grace?
sorry, Jane, I had to tell her. It's my job.
eh, that's not it.
get her back to the hospital. - Yes, boss.
she did remember something. We have a clue.
a lake in the mountain, something on the shore?
could be where the murders happened.
there's over 50 lakes in those mountains!
I'll take her back to the hospital.
listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you where I was going.
I was trying to protect you.
don' don't ever try to protect me.
I can protect myself from Hightower or anybody else.
okay. - Let's go back to the office.
we could. Or we could stay here and catch Leonard Railton's killer.
how are we gonna do that?
I need a cup.
paper or plastic-- I'd prefer paper.
so Jane Doe didn't remember the lake?
Posthypnot suggestion.
I show her a beautiful picture of a lake and told her that she would remember it when she heard the trigger phrase-- "say the word."
she remembered the picture, associated it with the crime and felt that something was left behind there.
what something?
well, it--it doesn't matter.
the killer's feeling panoid now, so he or she will be compelled to go back to the scene of the crime and make surthat nothing was left behind.
that's assing the murder occurred at the lake.
well, it did. - Because?
because the pot crop died, and Leonard Railton was worried about the water his girlfriend's baby was getting.
Hey, it's over here.
and the water supply for arounderer comes from the mountain lakes.
Cho followed the killer after the memorial.
And? Who is it?
we'll see.
where is he?
straight through the trees.
hands up.
what's going on? - Get your hands up.
no, I-I don't understand.
what are you doing?
rifle shell.
Where'd you get that, Mr. Willis?
I just found it.
I was gonna give it to you.
do you think it's connected to those murders?
that's the best you got?
why'd you shoot those four people, Mr. Willis?
I didn't.
but Leonard...
Leonard you killed because of what's in the lake, didn't you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
toxic waste.
great, big barrels of it, I expect.
dumped by you.
that's why the pot plants in the valley were dying.
that's why Derrien Hopwood's child got a rash.
Leonard was gonna tell, so you had to shut him.
and anyone else that just...... happened to come along that day.
I don't even know what to say.
that is not true.
well, this is ground zero for the dumping, so the water here must be much more toxic than it is down in the valley.
that is nonsense! - Really?
feeling a little parched?
have a drink.
no. No. - Why not?
Oh, come on. Cheers. Have a drink - No. - Little tip.
no. No, please, stop. No!
all right!
I tried to get so many ideas across theribal council.
so this guy said he needed to dump some stuff, and did I know any place on the rez that he could do it?
so I had Leonard take them up to the lake.
well, I figured with his record, he'd take the money and keep his mouth shut.
well, we went well.
got more trucks up there.
I mean, something was finally working for me.
and then that kid in the valley got a rash.
and Leonard was worried.
said we were poison in the valley, and if we didn't stop, that he was gonna blow the whistle.
then I overheard him on the phone, arranging to meet somebody at the lake.
so went, too.
when did the Langhams get there?
I was cleaning up.
you know, what they doing there anyway?
I'm sorry.
I am.
I'm sorry.
well, that's okay then.
as long you're sorry.
maybe we'll let you go.
I'm kidding.
he got something for you.
your driver's license.
got it from Markham Willis.
your name is Camille Dillon.
you live in Oakland.
you're an internet journalist and writer.
we contacted your family.
your mom is on her way from Des Moines.
my name is Camille?
apparently, you taught Leonard Railton while he was in the juvenile system.
a little while ago, he got in touch with you about-- wait.
something... something was wrong.
they were... someone was, dumping... - toxins.
Y-yes.
and he-- he wanted people to know.
he... he called... and he--he asked for my help.
I rem - I remember him.
I remember him asking for my help.
I remember. I remember me.
I know who I am.
just let me finish this up, and we'll go talk to Hightower.
Wayne... - what's up?
I love y. I do.
but I think I love the job more.
well, job's not a problem. I'm gonna go.
you'd be leaving the unit... for us. - So?
I don't want that responsibility.
you'll hate me for that.
maybe not today, but someday you will.
no, Grace, we-e-- I'm sorry.
you're, uh... certain about this?
I know who I am.
Rcotics picked up the pot farmers off the ranger's confession.
I also got a call from a guy named Silverwing Aboua stunt you pulled up on the storm rivereservation.
well, I wouldn't call that a stunt so m-- whatever.
he was displeased. - Yes, ma'am.
I filled out a paper-- you solved the triple, right?
Yeah. - Nobody got hurt?
no.
then the hell with him. You got justice done.
keep up the good work.
that was unexpected.
I'll say.
yo all right?
I'm fine. Okay, but...
Yeah, I-I just...
I just, forgot my... stuff.
are you Mr. Black?
Yeah.
you scared me.
so... I just...
tell me why I'm here.
I have something I need done.
so do most women. You're gonna have to be more specific.
right. Yes. Sorry.
um, what I need... I don't know quite how to put it.
well, you're just gonna have to open your mouth and say it out loud in full detail, like you're talking to your priest.
you show me yours. I'll show you mine. That's how it works.
okay.
here.
I want you to kill him.
how much do you charge?
we think she was killed about an hour ago.
neighbor heard screaming, called 9-1.
anybody see anything?
we've got Sac P.D. canvassing, but so far nothing. - Just an average night.
average night, average neighborhood, average murder.
why are we here?
because the victim is assistant district attorney Kelly Flower.
you worked with her. - Yeah, we all did.
Kelly was good people.
forensics found a casing. Said it was 9-mil.
almost point-blank, judging from the stippling.
deputy coroner said no sexual assault, but her nightgown's ripped and tangled.
she was crawling in it.
remodel?
Kelly's one of us.
Hightower's already approved the overtime.
you know the drill.
why is that the drill?
I mean, for everyone else, it just looks like for your own, you try harder.
we do.
it's a deterrent.
it sends out a message -- nobody gets away with killing a cop, a judge or a D. A.
Cho can get a list of Kelly's cases,
see who she put away that held a grudge.
it's not a deterrent. It's revenge, really.
I mean, and that's not a criticism, 'cause I'm all about revenge.
I mean, revenge can be very productive.
productive? - Well, take Rigsby.
van Pelt breaks up with him. Now he's in the best shape of his life.
I mean, he's hitting the gym, what, six times a week?
look at him.
he is brimming with sexual confidence.
Jane, cut it out.
not on my account. It's fine.
see? Fine. My point--there is nothing wrong with revenge.
van Pelt, any damage to the windows or the back door?
no, nothing.
no sign of forced entry, so either she let him in, or husband's here.
he let himself in.
Oh, my god! No! Kelly, no! No! No! God, no!
Tiffany wants you to call her back.
Oh, thanks.
said to tell you "you're a very bad boy."
did she?
agent Hightower, hi. - Morning.
you two know Marc Odenthal from the D. A.'s office?
sure.
we're gonna talk with the district attorney.
what can you tell me about kelly's case?
we're looking at anybody who had access to the house Cbs from work, the neighborhood, the local dog park, anywhere.
husband?
flower was too upset to talk last night. Jane and I are heading over there now.
and we've got a list of past defendants.
at least four have expressed written or verbal threats.
the D. A. told me to give you this.
it includes her current cases.
hang on. Hank Draber. The smuggler?
smuggling drugs, conspiracy to murder.
we haven't been able to lay a glove on 'em before.
Draber's trial was supposed to start next week.
I just got judge Hildred to grant a continuance.
it's gonna take me three months just to learn the file.
go. Take Van Pelt.
all right. There he is. Mr. Draber!
what do you want?
so how are you getting along lately? Any problems?
you... My wife is dead, and you're wasting your time on me?
Mr. Flower, I knew your wife.
now we're gonna find out who did this, even if it's you.
you understand?
so how were you two getting along?
we loved each other.
everything was good.
how was the remodel? That can be stressful.
things were good.
but that day, we fought.
that's why I went to the movies-- Over her hours.
it... It was just so stupid.
she was so stressed over that Draber case, you know?
she called it her "career-maker." That's what she said-- "career-maker."
so you argued. Did it turn physical?
no. I loved her.
I would never do anything like that. Never.
Mr. Flower? I got the tarp on the roof in case it rains before you want me back.
didn't mean to interrupt. I'll get out of your hair now.
thank you. That's our contractor Cale Sylvan. He's, uh...
Patrick Jane. How you doing? - Good.
you're standing in the... Can I ask yoru a question?
uh, would you recommend a flash hot water heater over a regular one?
I mean, I was leaning towards flash, but they're very expensive.
well, you know, flash will pay for itself in energy savings pretty quick, but it depends on consumption.
of course. That's a very good point.
um, do you have a card?
sure. - Great.
I'll maybe give you a call. - Great.
well, thanks for your time, Mr. Flower.
thank you.
Cale Sylvan is a dangerous psychopath, and he Killed Kelly flower.
how's that?
he had access, and he looked evil. - And...
when I told him he was standing in her blood, what was his reaction?
not horror. Not embarrassment.
no emotion at all. All right. I'll run him.
excellent. Having prints might help, no?
you know, you guys should be more careful. You almost got yourselves shot.
it's a good thing you look like cops.
we could take you in, but you'll lawyer up, and we'll all waste a lot of time.
but here we can have a nice conversation, right?
Yeah. That sounds reasonable.
fine.
Kelly Flower was all set to fry your ass in court. You were looking at 20 years, easy.
now the trial's been postponed who knows how long.
that gives you motive for her murder.
that one's a winner. I know it is.
here you go. You like the lotto, huh?
none of your business. - Mom. come on.
you have pretty hair.
my mom's a little senile.
now who'd take care of your mother if Kelly Flower put you in jail?
you know, killing a prosecutor is-- is almost as bad as killing a cop, right?
it's not something I want to get my hands dirty with.
I got enough problems as it is. Right, mom?
close your mouth, muffin.
well, Jane's right.
Sylvan is a killer.
you know, it feels good to be right.
prints brought up these I.D.s. We got Carl Sennett,
a witness in an accidental drowning in Arizona,
Cory Sampson, who lived next door to a hit-and-run victim in Seattle,
and Chad Sewell, wanted for questioning about the murder of his boss, a bank executive in Reno.
we have four other deaths that Sylvan's linked to in some other way.
he's not just a killer. He's a serial killer.
well, saddle up. Lock and load. Do what you do. Go--go bring him in.
we can't.
Nope. - What?
all we have is that Cale Sylvan liked to change his name.
not illegal-- and that bad luck followed him.
we don't even have enough for a search warrant.
he'll kill again. You-- you know what he is, Lisbon.
knowing isn't proving.
Rigsby, have Cho set up on Sylvan's house 24-hour surveillance.
if he shows up, have Cho follow him. Maybe we'll get lucky.
okay.
this--this is ridiculous.
I... I know. - I'm gonna go with Cho.
go.
Sylvan's smart enough to know we'll be here.
he won't be coming back.
it's a waste of time.
what are you reading there, Cho?
wuthering Heights.
well, I'm gonna take a stroll.
let me know how it ends.
not well.
Cho said Jane ditched him at Sylvan's. Have you seen him?
Nope. There's something hinky here, boss.
these are photos of some of the victims linked to Sylvan.
different ages, sexes, races.
exactly. A serial killer almost always hunts the same kind of prey.
this doesn't make sense as a serial killer's M. O.
it does when you look at Sylvan's financials.
I tracked bank records for all the I. D.s we could find.
Sylvan received substantial payments just before and just after each death.
he kills for money? He's a hit man?
a psychopath who made money from his hobby. It's outstanding.
you do something you love. You never have to work a day in your life.
where the hell have you been?
me? Oh, I've been around.
I found a web site registered to one of his old identies.
it says to "call Mr. Black for odd jobs of any sort."
well, I guess we should give him a call.
grace, do you happen to have any photographs of, uh, you know, ex-boyfriends?
I want you to kill him.
how much do you charge?
ask him again, Grace. You're a busy lady. You don't have all night.
you gonna answer me or not? I want the bastard dead--soon.
she's convincing. - Trying to work here.
okay.
I charge $50, 000.
and what you're asking is pretty easy.
I mean, you just gotta have to stop thinking of him as a person.
the rest is just a physics problem-- gravity, force, torque.
ask for proof of what he does.
torque is well and good, but I need to know that you're for real.
see, maybe you're a hitter.
maybe you're a cop.
long shot. - Trying to work here.
let me show you somethin'.
how's that?
let's move. - No, no, no. It's a test.
grace, listen. Listen very carefully.
are you a cop?
I'm not a cop.
I'm just careful, like you.
I just want to know that I have the right man.
besides, don't you want to show me...
besides, don't you want to show me, so you can make me afraid?
that's what you like, isn't it - Seeing the fear?
you show me yours, and I'll show you mine.
I have something to show you then.
just watch for a second.
Oh, wait. Oh, please!
look at it.
it's my last job.
the client was very happy.
proof. That's proof. Proof.
are we gonna do business? - Yes, we are.
CBI! Drop the knife! - Don't move!
hands on your head! - Drop the knife now!
don't move! On your knees!
Cale Sylvan, you're under arrest for the murder of Kelly Flower.
hands on your head!
Jane, you can come out.
okay.
how'd you know he had proof?
well, he's a narcissist. Needs affirmation, trophies.
who paid you to kill Kelly?
tell 'em. You'll feel better.
I would like to talk to my lawyer.
and I'll see you clowns in court.
catching killers I enjoy, but being reminded that we're just a cog in a petty, Fascist machine, that is a little depressing.
crime-fighting is hard. Suck it up.
if you weren't on the witness list,
I wouldn't even let you in the same time zone as Judge Dread.
"judge Dread"-- can't possibly be as much fun as it sounds.
Oh, please! Please! What do you want?
Oh, god! Oh, god, don't hurt me!
Oh, god! Oh, god, don't!
please! Please!
your honor, I object.
this video is inflammatory and prejudicial.
although we'll stipulate to the fact that Kelly Flower was murdered, we reserve our right to deny that there is probable cause my client committed said murder.
and we also object to the chain of custody for this video.
is that even a sentence?
quiet in the gallery!
you say another word, and you'll regret it.
well, I'm...I'm sorry, your honor, but this woman is spouting nothing but ludicrous pettifoggery,
and, uh, I'm a little hungry.
your honor, if you'll let me down, I can handle him.
Mr. Jane-- that is your name, correct?
that's correct. Patrick Jane.
well, this court hereby fines you $1, 000.
make it $2, 000, and let me tell this, uh, tiresome woman to move it along.
$2, 000 then. - Okay.
counselor, you heard the man. Move it along.
so, agent Lisbon, let's get back to this video.
that night was the first time you'd ever seen it?
Yes. - Are you sure?
objection. Asked and answered.
I'll move on, your honor.
so you never entered Mr. Sylvan's apartment and looked at the video on his computer or instructed anyone else to do so?
no.
well, then I need you to answer a puzzling question.
your honor, I would like to enter this into evidence as defense exhibit one.
I got this mug from Mr. Sylvan's sink.
but he didn't put it there.
so...
so tell me, how is it that this mug has Mr. Jane's fingerprints on it?
agent Lisbon, did your consultant break into Mr. Sylvan's home without a warrant?
no. No, of course not.
your honor, may I have a moment to confer with agent Lisbon?
you make it quick. This is getting interesting.
bailiff.
that's how you knew Sylvan had proof. You'd already seen it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
tell us what happened now.
I was with Cho. We were staking out Sylvan's place.
I decided I wanted to take a walk.
I happened upon Sylvan's door, unlocked.
and like any concerned citizen, I went in to look around and checked that the place hadn't been robbed.
then I left.
that's it. - Oh, crap.
what's the story, Mr. Odenthal?
your honor... Mr. Jane did enter Mr. Sylvan's residence,
but only because he feared there was an intruder inside.
you mean one besides himself?
I-it's not like I took anything, your honor.
your honor, what Mr. Jane is trying to say is that he's not a state agent.
he's a private consultant.
therefore, there's no fourth amendment violation.
Mr. Jane is a charlatan who has made a mockery of our legal system on numerous occasions.
in fact, a few months ago he refused to take a woman to the hospital for poisoning until she confessed to a murder.
she was not poisoned in the first place, and it was just a very clever ruse.
quiet, Mr. Jane. - For what it's worth.
you should be ashamed of yourself anyway.
you, too, agent Lisbon. You're the law.
I hold Mr. Jane's search to be illegal, and any evidence discovered then or during the sting is hereby excluded as fruit of the poisonous tree.
the video-- out.
any statements made by the defendant to agent Van Pelt-- out.
your honor, I object. Your anger is clouding your...
Mr. Odenthal, do you have any evidence of any kind that your consultant hasn't crapped all over?
no, your honor.
well, then the people v. Sylvan is hereby dismissed for lack of evidence.
Mr. Sylvan, you're free to go.
this is ridiculous, your honor.
this is wrong!
this don't make no sense!
I'll be seeing you.
he killed my wife!
how can he go free?
bailiff, bring in the next case.
I had a confession. I had video. I had an airtight case.
and it's all out.
how could you break into his place?
easy. The lock on the back door was very flimsy.
Marc, I apologize. I do. I also, I didn't think I'd be found out.
I mean, how was I to know they were going to dust for my fingerprints?
you let a killer back on the streets.
actually, I got the killer off the streets.
keeping him off the streets-- your job.
you're blaming me?
I'm not the one who got the murder weapon tossed.
court is theater. Whatever side has the best liar wins.
usually that's you, but today she was better.
you're an arrogant little bastard.
whoa, easy with the steel, brother.
Oh, relax. It's not loaded.
look, Marc, there is no double jeopardy here.
we can still take this to trial.
I will find new evidence. I promise.
you're a menace.
when I'm D. A. you'll never work with this office again.
so ambitious. - Not your call, Marc.
not then, not now. - You're defending him?
thank you, Lisbon. - Shut up, Jane.
I thought you two trusted each other.
so did I. - We do.
I-- we have trust.
I-I didn't tell her because I didn't want her to be complicit and then have to lie about it later.
some partnership you got going on here.
I'll have to send you home while the professional standards unit does its thing five days at least.
it's not her fault.
that will be the p. s.u.'s determination, no doubt.
this is just the situation we talked about, Patrick.
agent Lisbon is responsible for the actions of her team members, including you.
Yes, ma'am.
is that all? - Yes.
look, Lisbon, I'm so sorry. I really am.
lisbon needs some time off.
a few days off will do her good.
nice talking with you.
Rigsby, go back through Sylvan's financials.
van Pelt, take another look at Kelly's video of her murder.
see if we missed anything.
Hey, we'll serve up Sylvan as your welcome back present, okay?
it's a little chilly in here.
do you want to go get a coffee?
Oh, come on. Look at the bright side. You get five days off. You get five days off from me.
Cho, you're in charge. He's your problem now.
that's good. Cho's a big boy. He knows how to look after me.
you want to get a coffee?
did you bring a book?
could be a bit of a wait.
what are we doing here?
you're still mad with me about Lisbon's suspension.
Yeah. It's your fault.
you know, sometimes in order to catch these risk takers, we have to take risks.
there can be fallout.
tell me what's going on or I'm outta here.
okay.
I looked in Sylvan's kitchen cabinets.
not much of a tea selection.
he's a coffee geek-- drinks only the best, fresh-roast coffee.
and the best fresh-roasted coffee in Sylvan's neighborhood... is in this place here.
that's kind of thin.
Yeah, but I'm 100% confident that it... Thank goodness.
look, the judge warned us not to talk to Sylvan without his lawyer.
talk?
this is two guys bumping into each other in the coffee line.
that's a funny coincidence.
I told you I'd be seeing you.
well, you look well, I gotta say.
you're in a very relaxed state.
now confess that you killed Kelly Flower, and a huge burden will be lifted.
funny guy.
sense of humor. That's great.
well, maybe I did something wrong.
sorry to, uh, bother you.
accidents happen.
hypnosis. Great plan.
no, that would be silly. Hypnosis is illegal.
that was a misdirect so that I could search his jacket pockets and find...this.
a button, fluff and some sand?
Yeah. It's a little anticlimactic.
um, do you have an evidence baggie?
you're walking home.
or I could just carry it.
so Sylvan's financials are clean. There's just one thing I don't get.
the end of every month, he withdraws just over 2 grand in cash.
he has no family, no girlfriend.
sounds like rent.
his apartment's only $900, and he writes a check for that.
no, not his apartment-- his home.
a place to store his tools, process his victims, keep his trophies.
a murder house.
and if he's paying cash, it's a fair bet the name Cale Sylvan won't be on the lease.
the place could be anywhere.
maybe I can narrow it a little. Look at this.
this is from the Sylvan murder video.
the bag he's holding-- it's from Abs gym.
we show his picture around the gym. Maybe we find someone who knows his other address.
there's a dozen Abs gyms around here. It'll take days to canvass 'em.
I'll start with the ones by the river.
the sand Jane found in Sylvan's pockets-- it's river sand, not ocean sand.
how'd you know? - We're in Sacramento.
we got a river, not an ocean.
there's only one Abs gym near the river-- on Dos Robles.
on my way.
if you get an address, go straight to judge Hildred and get a search warrant.
we'll take down Sylvan today.
Aw, shut up.
you shouldn't have embezzled all that money, you big baby.
time to go to work.
I don't think you're gonna want to look at this.
what was that?
Freeze! Freeze!
let me see your hands! Let me see your hands!
get your hands off of me!
get your hands off me!
hook him up. - It's not me.
I hope you brought more people.
cheating son of a bitch.
you're okay. You're safe now.
you got it? There we go.
I sent the victim to the hospital.
he'll be okay... After three or four years of therapy.
good.
Yeah, that look's not so scary when you're in handcuffs, buddy.
either you tell us who hired you or you're looking at a slam-dunk death penalty.
maybe we can come to some kind of arrangement.
Cho, get down!
10-33. Shots fired.
man down. We need paramedics now.
G. s.w. to the chest.
shot came from the north of location. North of location.
let's get a bird in here now.
the son of a bitch is dead.
call in another team for the back of the house.
Thanks.
that's eight bodies so far, and that's just the ones Sylvan's clients didn't want found.
they're gonna be clearing missing persons cases for a month.
any luck on the shooter? - Not much.
kill shot came from that hillside, over two football fields away.
that's a tough shot.
so I guess whoever employed Sylvan hired a second shooter to cover his tracks.
the thing is, how did that client know that Sylvan had become a liability?
that's a good question.
Where's Jane?
this better be good. I was catching up on my TiVo.
liar. You were reading. But what?
progress reports?
no.
whatever.
this is gonna be a lot of fun.
I'm going into the Drabers' lair.
it's not a lair, it's an office, and no, you're not.
Oh, yes, I am.
they seem kind of scary. You wouldn't want me to get hurt, would you?
don't bet on it. W-why the Drabers?
a hunch.
they're key in this somehow.
you think they hired Sylvan?
well, Sylvan looked the part.
why the hell didn't you call Cho?
well, you were closer.
call Cho. I'm not even armed.
more lies.
you have at least two guns in that car.
three? Oh, my.
you're the poster girl for the N.R.A.
I'm telling you, I've got nothing to do with the prosecutor dying.
and the Sylvan guy-- never heard of him before I saw him on the news.
hello. Hi!
gonna win big.
gonna buy a washing machine.
she's a treasure.
you want to leave her alone? She's a little soft in the head, okay?
you know, Hank, as you were talking to Lisbon here,
I couldn't help but notice you kept looking at your mother,
as if you were checking for her approval.
I mean, most tough guys are scared of their mothers, but, Hank, you were quaking.
your friend's crazier than my mom.
digging those nails.
plucked eyebrows, coiffed hair.
did you do the, uh, makeover, Hank?
no, didn't think so.
time for my stories, Hanky.
okay, Hanky.
you are upsetting her, okay? So leave her alone.
easy.
this is brilliant.
Lisbon, this is brilliant.
you--you are a treasure.
you're running this whole operation, aren't you?
Hank's just a figurehead to take the heat.
tell me I'm right. You know, I should have checked the shoes.
damn it, Hank.
I told you about looking at me, didn't I?
you think you're so damn clever.
well, clever is as clever does, and you've just made a very stupid move.
boys!
Oh, dear.
how clever are you now exactly?
we're cops. Just be cool.
put the weapons down now.
you put your gun down, Miss Lisbon, and you can live.
come on. Get in.
I was right about Annabelle anyway.
Congratulations.
so we're good, right?
you're not gonna put a hit out on me?
you've moved on.
that's good.
I've moved on, too.
well, I'm glad. That's a relief.
you guys heard from Jane?
no. - No.
Hello?! Anybody?! Hello?!
I can't really see anything.
there's kind of a draft right here, though, if you just... Just there.
no food, no water.
this is not good.
well, I suppose we should draw straws to see who eats who first.
Yeah, right. Draw straws with a professional cheat.
why so grumpy? It's not like we're gonna die here.
the Drabers don't want us dead.
come here and get a little bit of this breeze.
it'll cheer you up. Come here.
it's not quite as nice as a river breeze, but it's not bad.
you feeling that? Good.
river breeze.
wait a minute.
I live nowhere near the docks.
well, that's good. It's a terrible neighborhood.
you said you called me because I was closer,
but the H.Q. is only 15 minutes from the docks.
I'm-- I'm just-- I'm bad with distances, always have been.
Patrick Jane, you were trying to help me.
you were.
you thought if I made a big bust, The P.S.U. would get off my back.
you know I'm always gonna save you, Lisbon, whether you like it or not.
I don't need to be saved.
I knew this would end a disaster the day I signed on with you.
one day I'm gonna get fired because of you. That's just the way it is.
right. Well, some people might ask why you signed on with me in the first place.
we catch a lot of bad guys.
most days, that's enough.
also, I... - I think I hear something.
someone out there. - Where?
Hello! - Hello?
over here! - In here!
around the front. The--the big latch.
I told you I would save you, Lisbon.
sac P.D. found Jane's car at the docks. Lisbon's, too.
crap. - No sign of them or the Drabers.
call Sac P.D., I.C.E. and the coast guard.
have them search every vehicle... warehouse and boat the Drabers own.
van Pelt. Slow down.
agent Rigsby.
can you? - I'll call you back.
it's the federales, I think.
something about Jane and a goat?
Louise Willett robbed the very people she was supposed to be taking care of,
and she spent that money ipso facto, ad nauseam. Sorry, Odenthal. I need to borrow your judge for a second.
uh, Mr. Jane, we are in session.
Yes, we would have come earlier, but, uh, we had quite a long walk getting here.
it won't take a second.
we just need one of your fancy arrest/warrant thingies for Annabelle Draber.
she'll give you the details. - Jane, get out of here.
Mr. Jane, there are no phones in my courtroom.
I'm very sorry. Just a minute, Cho.
I'm kinda busy. - That's $1, 000, Mr. Jane.
sure. Uh, listen, I'm kinda in the middle of something, so I'll call you back.
$2, 000. hang it up. Now!
Really? - $3, 000.
listen, Cho, uh... - $4, 000.
your honor, I move for a mistrial. - $5, 000.
you're not costing me another case. Give me that phone.
no. Get your own.
your honor-- battery?
Bailiffs, would you arrest this man, please?
Lisbon, this... Hang on, Cho.
I'm on suspension. No badge, no authority.
Oh, thanks for bailing me out.
lisbon wasn't answering her phone for some reason.
the judge is really pissed, so is Odenthal.
they want to make an example.
it's not just contempt of court, Jane. It's battery.
battery against a peace officer.
penal code section 242 "et seq."I love the Latin.
you know there's 30 kinds of battery charges?
Yes.
this stuff is fascinating.
you know, I could be my own lawyer.
you're gonna represent yourself?
you represent yourself, you're an idiot.
uh, it's actually "he who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client."
it's much catchier.
could be fun, Cho.
this may be a, um, a somewhat informal hearing,
but you still must respect this court, or you will go directly back to jail.
do you read me? - Yeah, you bet, your honor.
Mr. Jane asked me to come.
do you know why?
I have no idea.
let's get right to it, Mr. Jane.
is it true that yesterday, you tweaked the assistant district attorney's nose in this very room?
speaking of yourself in the third person, Marc,
y-you gotta admit, sounds a little silly.
Yes, I tweaked your nose.
your honor, we're done here. Mr. Jane admits the crime.
but in my defense, you were being very annoying.
Mr. Jane, you're out of order.
you're out of order. You're out of order.
this whole trial's out of order!
Oh, come on. You gotta admit, you walked right into that one.
okay.
all right, my turn to question you guys.
Yes. Wait. "you guys"? Plural?
well, you're both witnesses.
uh... When I'm cross-examing myself,
do-- do I have to stand down there and ask the questions
and run back up here and answer them?
Mr. Jane, you stay put.
okay.
Mr. Odenthal, you take a deep breath.
pro perdefendants are given a certain amount of latitude.
you know that. God help us all.
judge Hildred, are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
what? No!
Mr. Odenthal, do you own a gun?
wait. What? - Are you a good shot?
don't answer that. How about you, your honor? You any good with a gun?
the person that killed Cale Sylvan, they estimated, was more than 200 yards away.
that is a great shot.
it's why we assume there was a second hit man.
Mr. Jane, please sit down.
were you having an affair with Kelly Flower?
no.
but isn't it true that you delight in killing small furry animals?
you're a hunter.
this is irrelevant.
this is how we solve a murder.
are you saying you don't want me to solve a murder?
of course I do.
then answer the question, sir.
answer it, or tell me why you won't.
I go duck hunting every season.
and what kind of gun do you use to kill these defenseless ducks?
a 10-gauge shotgun.
and would you consider yourself a very good marksman?
uh, last season I bagged a mallard at, uh, 60 yards.
Oh, that's not bad. Not--not bad at all.
10-gauge, 3-inch shell. 3 inches of hell. 3 inches of death.
3 1/2.
I mean, I think. Right?
so you must be a hunter, too.
no. I...
then what's that dead beast in your office, Marc?
what is that? Did you just get it off craigslist?
well, I, uh, I mean, yes, I used to hunt, just not anymore.
but you still know your way around a gun, don't you?
Oh, relax.
it's not loaded.
you own your own rifle, don't you?
you heard that the judge had issued a warrant for Sylvan's murder house,
and you knew that you had to silence Sylvan before he talked.
Cho, get down!
you had to silence him before he named you as his client,
the client who hired him to kill Kelly Flower.
your honor, this is completely ridiculous.
so prove it.
let us search your house. We don't find a gun, I'll apologize.
let him do the search, Marc.
no.
no?
no.
I don't have to do that.
I have rights.
and you're obviously prejudiced against me, judge.
and I'm going to take that up with the chief judge.
in fact, I'm going to do that right now.
you should stay put, counselor.
bailiff. - Don't move.
sir, your hands.
the gun that killed Sylvan-- a Remington 700, with scope, from your garage.
Oh, and, uh... We got a warrant.
you're right. A lot better with one of these.
you're a good prosecutor. You know what this means.
a sniper rifle-- lying in wait, murder with special circumstances.
Hello, death penalty.
but if you're willing to come clean about Kelly's murder,
the D. A. will take death off the table.
that is the last and only offer you'll get, you miserable sack of crap.
I realized the Drabers didn't hire Sylvan when they didn't kill Lisbon and me.
if they don't kill cops,
they're certainly not gonna kill an assistant district attorney.
but the Drabers were connected somehow, weren't they?
cause their case was a career maker, according to Kelly,
and you wanted to be D. A. someday.
the Draber case would have made me a lock for D. A.
Oh, yeah.
and it should have been me. I had seniority.
it was mine, and the bitch took it.
so you hired Sylvan to kill her.
Yes.
and when Sylvan was arrested, you told him you'd fix it, that he'd walk.
as prosecutor, you had that power.
then you had Sylvan tell his attorney to investigate me.
the whole D. A.'s office knows how you operate.
craziness.
I thought there was a good chance you'd stepped over some line or other.
turned out you had.
it's all right. He's learned his lesson.
Yeah, I have.
I certainly have, Lisbon.
I won't be stopping for tea again.
...and lights out at 9: 30, and your sister at 9: 00.
no.
I love you.
Bye.
you wanted to see us, ma'am?
sit.
before I make any final decisions, I want to make sure I understand what happened.
you disrupted a courtroom, assaulted an officer of the court.
so you could question him and nearly caused a mistrial in an unrelated felony case.
is that about right?
Yeah, that's pretty accurate.
you ignored your suspension, confronted a gang of criminals without any backup.
and then participated In Mr. Jane's disruptions, assault, etcetera?
Yes, ma'am.
all right, then.
I'm sorry. I don't understand, ma'am.
the CBI just busted a crooked D.A.
rooted out corruption and solved the murder of one of our own.
awesome.
by the way, I.C.E. picked up the Drabers at the Canadian border.
the D. A. announced he'll try the case himself.
we should have done that in the first place.
I'll tell the p.s.u. to terminate your suspension.
welcome back.
Patrick, judge Hildred's clerk called.
you owe the court $16, 000 in fines.
he needs a cashier's check.
Hey, Jerry.
let's do it.
thank you, Sadie.
my friends, I am so proud and happy to welcome you to this celebration of my son Xander, the new CEO of Harrington media.
where is the little cuss, anyway?
late for work already-not a good sign.
Elizabeth, text him, would you? - You got it.
um, I am sure my husband has a very good excuse for his... Ah, there you are, Xander.
that's what killed Xander Harrington, and this is where he was attacked.
now the blood trail starts here, right where the letter opener was found.
the deputy coroner says it was a single stab wound to the neck.
now the blow sends him backwards.
he slams his head, goes down.
he's dazed, slowly bleeding out for a good 20 minutes or so, then somehow gathers himself up and goes for help.
coroner couldn't believe he even made it out to the party.
party which was for him.
guy just got a big promotion.
had a wife and kid. How sad is that?
sad. Anything else?
well, according to the victim's father, there was a confidenticial business file on this desk that's gone missing.
nothing else taken.
what was the file about?
plans for the "Daily Observer" -- newspaper.
debt restructuring, cost cutting, layoffs.
layoffs?
any "observer" employees invited to the party?
so you're reporters for the, uh, "observer."
Xander Harrington -- man of the people, huh?
inviting the ink-stained wretches.
Xander was a good guy.
did any of you hear about the layoffs that were coming up soon?
layoffs? What layoffs?
well, actually, there's, uh, quite a long list.
Yeah. It appears that no one is safe.
must be very scary in the newspaper business these days.
that's a very lovely dress. Great color.
well, thank you. I'm Heather Evans.
Hello, Heather Evans. You're very attractive.
it's probably why your name's not on that list.
good-looking women live in a different world.
excuse me? What's this list you keep mentioning?
Oh, come on, Heather. The list that was in the file that you took off Xander Harrington's desk.
everyone here-- we mention layoffs, and everyone here reacts except you, because you have read the list.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
I didn't go anywhere near Xander's desk.
Bravo.
very well played, considering the stress you must be feeling right now.
you know, I was hoping to dazzle you all with my uncanny detective skills, but you force me...
you force me to just reveal the humdrum facts and point out that you have blood on your shoes, Heather.
could you step out of your shoes, ma'am?
"stop the presses"?
that's the phrase, right? "Stop the presses." Yeah. Got it.
always wanted to say that.
Xander Harrington caught you snooping in his office, and you killed him.
now maybe you didn't mean to do it.
you were surprised, scared-- No. I didn't even see him.
it was dark.
no lights.
curtains were drawn.
I went to the desk, I took the file, and I ran.
if I'd known he was... My god, I would never have...
how'd you know that there was a list at all?
someone told you. Who?
a confidential source.
and you'll go to jail to protect this source?
edward Harrington - Xander's brother.
he, um... He said there were gonna be layoffs on Monday.
I just-- I just wanted to know whether or not I still had a job.
it's a very good job.
not anymore, it's not.
tell me exactly what happened from the beginning.
ma'am?
is there, uh, i-is there something specific that you wanted?
no. No.
just keeping apprised. Huh.
Alex Harrington is the owner of the seventh largest media conglomerate in the world.
Yes, ma'am.
and you don't want to disappoint a man who owns 200 TV stations and a national newspaper.
no, ma'am.
looks like Heather's cleared.
timeline puts her at the bar at the time of the attack.
that's according to several male guests who remember her well.
figures. Only leaves 196 party guests and 42 staff as potential suspects.
start with the brother. - Okay.
take Rigsby.
problem?
Nope. Not at all.
ma'am? You're giving my team assignments?
I know. I'm sorry.
should've been your call.
I just want to make sure those two can hack it.
fair enough.
the head of your security said that the house is fully wired, but the family asked the cameras inside be turned off?
Why's that?
I take responsibility for that.
no, it's my fault.
I'm Tara-- Alex's wife. This is Ella.
and I'm the one who had the cameras disconnected.
it's my fault. - It's nobody's fault, dear.
hush. - Why'd you do it?
cameras and panic rooms and armed guards-- it's a lot to take.
I hated feeling watched in my own home.
seems so silly now.
I'm sorry. How long until you take that horrible stuff down?
forensics has promised to release the crime scene as soon as possible.
I am so sorry for any inconvenience.
excuse me.
uh, I'm too upset.
uh, m-may I?
thank you.
so, uh, you and Xander were close?
he and Sadie were my only true friends.
people seem more interested in befriending your money and connections when you're married to the C. E.O. of Harrington media.
Yes, I suppose it can be difficult at times.
by the way, it's former C. E.O. Xander forced me out.
Really? - Really.
he convened the board, secured the necessary votes.
son staged a coup.
Yes.
you have any idea the guts it takes to pull that off?
Xander proved he could lead.
I've never been prouder of him.
proud of, uh, eddie, too-- my other son.
well, of course. But xander had the strength to lead, the guts.
that's important to you, isn't it--guts?
of course. Guts, heart.
what else is there?
spleen, liver, kidneys, uh, genitalia.
lot of important stuff there.
are you being flippant with me?
my son is dead.- Forgive me. I-I was.
lost myself for a second. Forgot where I was.
but, you know, that--that's a very beautiful painting.
very nice work, yeah.
can I talk to you for a moment?
quit that!
what? - Poking the bigwig.
poking the bigwig.
Ah, I like it. It's got a nice ring to it.
I understand it's compulsion you're not fully in control of, but I wish you would try.
it would make our work a lot easier if you did...Try.
did you see that? - What?
right outside that window.
there's a pink unicorn. Amazing!
now you're hallucinating.
no. No, no, look. It's right outside the window.
seriously, look. It's a unicorn!
I want to see!
I don't see a unicorn. - It's right there.
I'm trying to trick her.
Yes. Yeah. What a nice unicorn.
Yeah, very nice unicorn.
so you like to have secret tea parties?
how did you know about the tea party?
Oh, you know, I kind of like secret tea parties, too.
I'm Patrick. That's Teresa.
I'm Ashley Harrington. It's a pleasure to meet you.
you, too. Now who's your mom and dad?
Xander Harrington and Sadie Cardozo Harrington.
I know my address and phone number, too.
very good.
Patrick and I are actually looking for your mommy. Do you know where she is?
outside. We could go cheer her up.
is she sad, sweetie?
she misses daddy. He went away on a trip.
Mr. Harrington, you prodded Heather Evans into going into your brother's office, didn't you?
I told her the file was on the desk.
what she did with that information is her problem.
you're the west coast head of media operations, and you tell an employee about a confidential layoff list?
well, I had a feeling she'd be grateful.
and she was.
you exchanged the information for sex.
Yes. I did.
gate security has you leaving the party just before your brother died of his injuries.
I didn't know what had happened, and I didn't particularly want to watch his coronation, frankly.
it's boring.
forgive me, Xander.
did you kill your brother, Ed?
would you mind giving us a second?
no, I did not kill my brother.
well, you didn't seem that sad about his death.
well, maybe I just don't display my emotions to cops.
maybe.
look, I'd like to tell you that xander and i were the best of friends, but we weren't.
we're just different people. We were different people.
he'd... always do the right things, say the right things.
dad would say,"jump." He'd ask,"how high?"
and you?
dad never asks me to jump.
mommy! Mommy!
baby, hmm?
we're going to get ice cream. - Okay. One scoop, okay?
no spoiling dinner.
okay. - One scoop it is.
and I'll e-mail you the Arizona overnights.
you've got that conference call tomorrow with the affiliates.
okay. Thanks, Elizabeth.
come on.
you haven't told her?
how do you tell a 6-year-old her father's never coming home?
well, she pretty much knows already. She just doesn't understand it yet.
nor do I.
I just-- I keep thinking Xander would know exactly what to say to her.
it's so stupid, huh?
Xander must have had enemies-- business rivals that resented his success?
um... Sure.
Yeah, but nothing abnormal.
well, there is the "visualize" thing.
the "observer" is about to run an investigative series, and it's gonna be very critical.
visualize? The sort of religious group?
you know, it's more like a cult. It's brainwashing with a sideline in tax fraud.
you know, we got a-a pretty nasty letter from their leader bret stiles-- threatening unspecified trouble if we ran it.
I can get you a copy.
Oh, you--you had me at "cult."
creepy.
what, you don't like giant eyeballs?
no.
I'm Steven Wench.
most folks call " me brother Steve."
are you the C. B.I. Folks who called?
Yeah. Brother Patrick and, uh, my brother Cho.
well, come this way. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid Mr. Stiles isn't on the premises today.
where is he?
at this precise moment, I don't know.
Bret lives spontaneously.
but I'm happy to help with any questions.
I have a question. Uh, what are they doing in there with those gizmos?
that's where our technicians assess for inner vision.
Really?
that sounds fun. Can anyone do that?
um... Sure.
excellent. Cho, you got the interview, right?
just, uh, sign in. - Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.
I wanna go.
have a seat. - Cool. Excellent.
all right.
just kidding. W-what do I do?
well, place your fingers on the orb and, uh, tell me your name.
you first.
David. - Hi, David. I'm Patrick.
fingers on the orb.
do you find sadness in the world around you?
Yes.
do you find yourself dwelling on the misfortunes of your past?
Yeah.
do you often think people are secretly out to get you?
Yes.
how you doing?
how am I doing?
Yeah. Uh, how am I doing?
well, Patrick, you have serious issues with paranoia and depression and negative thinking in general.
what?
I would recommend our immersive visualization program for you, as a matter of urgency.
Oh, okay.
um... Do--do--do you-- do you take that?
not so fast. You thought you had me, didn't you?
maybewe should get going. We gotta go get a warrant.
before coming to persecute us, did you even look at Xander Harrington's wife?
Sadie. - We look at everyone, sir. What about her?
we heard there was trouble in her marriage.
if Xander divorced her, there's a prenup.
but if he dies, she gets it all.
Where'd you hear that,Steve? Do--do you have someone on the inside?
I've said enough. Please leave.
do you have a gift shop? Cause I'd love an eyeball mug or something.
no.
okay.
good job, Steven. Good job.
that was...beautifully handled.
thank you, Mr. Stiles.
no, thank you.
so the guy claims Stiles is only threatening legal trouble, that visualize is a religion of science and peace.
tell that to the TV reporter from Atlanta.
last spring, he went off on visualize, next day, he was flying through the windshield of a member's car.
one more thing. About Sadie and Xander's marriage...
an affair?
no. Xander and I have been partners in everything since the first week of business school.
I loved him, and I respected him.
I had no reason to stray.
neither did he.
sometimes you don't need a reason.
agent Lisbon, you're here.
something to report?
no, she just, um, thinks I was screwing around on your son.
excuse me. I have better things to do.
do you think she was having an affair?
on balance, no.
go on.
Sadie loves this company, as well as my son.
she'd never risk everything for a roll in the hay.
ambitious as all hell, that girl.
I like it. Don't get me wrong.
she's doubled our profit, excuse my rudeness.
agent Lisbon.
get everybody out of the house. - There's not enough time.
do what you can.
Hello?
it's me. I need your help.
well, hello, Lisbon. You need my help?
I need your help finding a bomb.
there's still time. You're good at this kind of thing.
if we find the bomb intact, maybe we can still get rid of it.
what, are you nuts? What do you want to do that for?
it's a bomb. Just get out of there.
the guy's got comprehensive home insurance, I'm sure.
Oh, come on, Jane. We've got two minutes. All right?
where did they put it?
they said it was somewhere in the grand salon.
well, if they called it the grand salon, then obviously they're insiders.
good point.
uh, l-leading us where?
uh, let me see.
uh, if I was familiar with that room, I would plant a bomb... Try under the sofa.
no, no, no, no, no.
the cupboard over by the dutch forgery in the corner.
uh, th-the painting?
how do you know it's a forgery?
eh, the brushwork-- it's all wrong. It's way too loose.
Oh, my god. You were right.
Yeah, well, of course. That looser feeling didn't develop until much later on.
No! The bomb. I found it.
one minute left. - Oh, good. Time to leave.
get out of there.
Lisbon, if you think I am even gonna engage in this game of "which wire to pull," I'm not interested.
I don't wanna play that game. Just leave right now.
run. Okay?
okay. You're right. I'm outta here. - Thank you.
good.
Where's mommy?
hang on.
Ashley? Ashley, we have to leave now.
No!
Lisbon! - Ashley, get out from under there.
Ashley. - No! No! I want my mommy!
sweetie, come on. We have to go.
what's going on there?
Ashley, come on.
Ashley! Ashley! - No! Leave me alone! I want my mommy!
come out! You come out now! That's an order!
Lisbon, pick up the girl and leave. Just pick her up and take her outside.
you can do that. Run away now.
Oh god!
you are a very bad girl.
you're a bad girl.
agent Lisbon.
thank you.
thank you for saving my granddaughter.
we are so grateful.
it's all part of the service.
no, you were brave and resourceful, and I'll make sure your supervisors say as much in your file.
look, if there's ever anything I can do for you personally, please don't hesitate.
well, you could offer her the pad for a weekend during the summer.
actually, uh, I was wondering if I could speak with some of your staff who had access to that room.
Ah, Edward. Thank you for joing us.
I just heard what happened. Is everyone all right?
Oh, everyone's fine. It's fine.
well, if there's anything I can do to help, just say the word. I'm here.
actually, uh, I'll be issuing an announcement, and I wanted to let you and sadie know first.
announcements? Ooh, I love announcements.
um, sh-should we order up a round of cocktails?
I'll make this quick.
uh, as much as it pains me to discuss business at a time like this,
but the fact is, we do have shareholders, and the board has demanded a new C. E.O. be announced immediately.
Sadie, I bet.
uh... Ed, I-I'm sorry.
no. No, that's okay.
that's... It's your right to name whoever you want.
uh, I-I don't know what to say, Ed. I'm...
no, it's okay. It's, um... I get it.
I get it.
um, I'm sure you'll do a great job. Congratulations.
okay... Well, I'm not gonna say anything.
the bomb threat-- we got something.
it came from the phone of Elizabeth Stanfeld.
Sadie Harrington's assistant. Let's go get that warrant.
nice work.
Thanks.
kitchen's clear.
bedroom, too.
van Pelt been acting weird to you?
please don't talk to me about Van Pelt.
no, I won't.
has she? - No.
it's just she's... she's been smiling at me.
no kidding.
sometimes I think she might still be into me.
that'd be weird, huh?
you're weird.
cold.
you know, I don't think Stanfeld's been here in a while.
Hey, check this out.
Visualize: a tool for living.
Elizabeth Stanfeld's a member of visualize.
looks like Bret Stiles is gonna be talking to us after all.
the eye is not just the window to the soul.
it is the key to unlocking your greatness.
it is the key, because when you see it, you will be it.
one more time.
the eye is not just the window to the soul.
it is the key to unlocking your greatness. - Excuse me. I'm sorry.
uh... The eye is the key?
or the window? Or is it both? I'm a little confused.
Mr. Jane, I presume.
Yeah. - Hello. Welcome.
Oh, you're expecting us?
Oh, yes.
and I presume this is your long-suffering colleague, agent Lisbon.
if I may say, she is more beautiful than advertised.
Oh, thanks, guy. Take a little break. Thank you.
give us a few minutes. Thank you. Thank you.
Elizabeth Stanfeld, your, um...
dear friend and fine student
she planted a bomb at the harringtons' house-- a bomb she couldn't have possibly made herself.
lisbon here defused it.
heroine.
well, I-I'm--I mean, I may have taught her.
uh... Stanfeld?
uh, w-was she a brunette?
Mr. Stiles, "dear friend"?
well, yeah, but, you know, I've signed millions of these in my time.
I always like to personalize them.
it's a little trick I learned from an old friend of mine, Ronnie Reagan.
so you have no knowledge of this woman?
you have no knowledge of any attacks on the Harrington family?
that's your position, is it?
no, it's not "my position."
actually, it's the truth.
my eyes aren't, uh... Windows or doors or even keys, for that matter.
I use 'em to look at things, and what I'm looking at right now is a big, fat liar.
Really? - Really.
Yes. Betrayed by a faint facial tremor.
you could work on that in the mirror. You'd get some great results.
you know, now I see why... Red John really enjoys sparring with you.
a worthy adversary, yeah?
Yes.
straight for the jugular.
obviously, you struck a nerve.
losing a wife and a child like that... Well, it makes a man reckless, untethered.
fills him with anger and shame that he cannot express.
well, must make your job very hard, hmm?
Yes, but the health plan's great.
Mr. Jane, I think we can help you.
I think we can scrub that shame and grief and self-hatred right out of your system.
bret, please.
we both know what you are.
I mean, let's be honest here. You're a con man.
I mean, you're very charming, and you're very good at it, but you're just a con man.
and you could no more help me than you can fly to the moon.
now who's struck a nerve?
nobody's past helping... Even you.
believe me when I say this, Bret-- you don't want to make this personal.
now give us Stanfeld, or I will make it my sole purpose to hound you for the rest of your miserable, phony life.
am I hearing a threat here?
I mean, a-aren't there rules about this sort of thing? Hmm?
like you said, untethered.
Mr. Stiles, the percentage play here is to give us Stanfeld.
she's not gonna betray you. She's loyal.
forget it, Lisbon.
I'm bored.
Elizabeth is at Edward Harrington's penthouse.
she went to Edward? To do what?
I don't know.
uh, she didn't tell me. I gave her no instructions.
she went of her own free will.
have a nice day.
Rigsby, get to Ed Harrington's place immediately.
police! Don't move!
let me see your hands! Freeze! - Mr. Harrington?
Mr. Harrington, are you... All right?
Yep. I think he's... Fine.
what the hell is going on?
see, the way it looks from here is that you and Elizabeth were in this together.
take out Xander, take out your father, live happily ever after with her and Bret Stiles.
no.
I'm not into that visualize crap.
if I had any idea, I-- uh, she was just-- just a friend.
convenient, though, that she seems intent on taking out everyone between you and the top job at harrington media.
was Sadie next?
how do you know I wasn't next?
visualize wanted to kill us all because of that idiotic story.
then why didn't she kill you, Ed?
I don't know you ever meet Bret Stiles? No.
anyone at all from the visualize organization?
no.
so let me get this straight-- she was sleeping with you because you were a Harrington, but not an important enough Harrington to kill. Is that it?
you're a stooge.
Yeah, I'm a stooge. Thanks for the heads-up.
so Bret Stiles claims you acted alone.
but you had an accomplice, didn't you?
an accomplice to what? - The bombing attempt.
we've got your phone records. Slam dunk. 20 years.
2 decades.
7, 000 days living in a box. I don't know how people do it.
now help yourself out here.
we know someone gave you that bomb. We know you didn't kill Xander.
Sadie Harrington was with you the entire party.
of course I didn't kill him. - But you know who did.
give us a name, and we can talk a deal.
I'm looking down at you from a great height.
you're like ants.
it's sad how far I am beyond you people, spiritually and mentally.
but, uh, physically, I think we, uh, we might have the upper hand.
and physically is kinda how they roll in prison.
just because you've stopped my work doesn't mean others won't follow in my path.
you can't imprison the truth.
Oh, Lizzy, you are batnuts crazy.
Batnuts, girl.
but that's okay. You're young.
you can recover your wits.
you're gonna have to work very hard, but you've given me a very good idea, and I thank you.
excuse me.
we've come to take my son home. This is a family matter.
I'm sorry, sir, but we haven't finished questioning him.
edward made a mistake. It was dangerous, yes, but not criminal, so unless you have some evidence linking him to a crime, Ii'd like you to let him go.
let the poor wretch go, Van Pelt.
he's guilty of nothing except extremely poor decision-making, sexual partner-wise, and, uh... Who hasn't been there?
it isn't in my authority to allow that, sir, but if you'll wait a moment, I'll find agent Lisbon, and she may be able to help you out.
dad? - Never mind. There he is.
Eddie, we're leaving.
you bastard!
you stupid son of a bitch!
how could you endanger us?
Ashley was nearly killed.
I'm sorry. - I'm gonna go wait in the car.
I'm really sorry. - You're sorry? Sorry?
have you no common sense, boy?
are you completely-- sir, you're gonna have to take it easy.
anyhow, here we are.
let's go home and discuss this.
Mr. Harrington, that isn't going to be possible.
Oh, hell. Not again.
what's wrong?
miserable cowards. More threats!
what does it say?
next time you won't be so lucky.
sent from the same number as the earlier threat.
I thought you had traced that call to Stanfeld.
well, they likely use the same number for many different cloned cells.
it proves it's the same people, anyhow.
meaning visualize.
agent Hightower, I'm going to need additional protection for my family, at least until we can get to the house in london.
Mr. Harrington, while your family's safety is at stake, maybe it's best to postpone the expos?
if I gave in, where does it stop?
my family would be under constant threat from people who don't like what I print or air.
we need protection, agent Hightower.
Mr. Harrington, the police assigned to you are very well-trained personnel.
we can add more if--I want your best people-- Ms. Lisbon and her team.
I'll insist on it.
Mr. Harrington, that's very flattering, but you-- and if you could release my son now, I'd appreciate it.
I'll see what we can do.
she's about to throw out the queen of spades.
stop showing off.
that's what's called "cutting off your nose to spite your face."
I'll take that. Thank you. - Lisbon.
good night, everyone. Good night.
Alex, I told ash she could stay up if you tucked her in. Is that okay?
Absolutely. - Thank you.
night, sweetie.
perimeter's clear, boss.
just checked in with the guards outside.
gin. There you go.
who's next? Any takers?
wish me luck.
double. - Sure.
you're a lucky man.
no such thing as luck. - Really?
it's all about knowing the odds, seizing the chances.
no luck involved.
hogwash. - Hogwash?
you heard me. - Hogwash.
what's that?
what?
what are you......
wait a minute. I hear it, too.
I got Ashley covered here.
it's coming from in there.
Xander's office? It's been sealed since the murder.
clear.
could've sworn I heard someone in here.
Oh, what's this?
that's Ashley's.
so? - That's it.
what's it?
she was here. She was right here.
what's he talking about? - No idea.
that's why she's been so quiet and withdrawn. She witnessed the murder.
the power's been cut.
uh... W-we have a-a backup generator.
perimeter's been breached. Someone's on the grounds.
copy that, Van Pelt.
Charlie king one, check the grounds.
Charlie king one, do you copy?
Charlie king one?
grandpa?
it's okay, honey.
don't be scared.
we're safe in here.
everything's gonna be all right.
come on.
there you go.
Oh, I could do with some chocolate.
you have any, uh, chocolate, Grace?
no. - Just a little bit?
van Pelt, what's the status? - Lisbon, that was very good. I have one question.
who the hell is Charlie king? - Call it up.
I want mommy.
Hey, you remember the party we had a few days ago?
with all the flowers and music?
that's right. You were in daddy's office that afternoon, before the guests got here for the party, remember?
uh, were you maybe... Hiding under his desk?
playing tea party?
it's all right if you were. You won't get in trouble.
tell grandpa the truth, sweetheart.
if you were there, maybe you saw the game grandpa was playing with daddy.
did you?
what the hell is going on?- Uh, we--it's a very clever plan.
would you like me to explain? - Wait. Why are they in the safe room?
what are you doing? - Ma'am, if you'll come with me, I'll explain everything.
30 seconds and I'm pulling the plug.
daddy's dead, isn't he?
it was a game.
when your daddy fell... I didn't mean to do it.
Cho.
put your hands on your head.
now.
you're under arrest.
you're a bastard!
what's wrong with grandpa?
it's okay, baby. It's okay.
you've got nothing.
my lawyers will grind this to dust.
don't say a single thing, either of you.
they're saying I killed Xan.
well, that's not true, right?
of course not.
it was very sweet seeing you with Ashley.
uh, I guess after two sons, when she came along, it lit up your world.
strange, though, that you can't so much as look at your own daughter, nor barely touch your lovely wife.
how'd you find out the baby wasn't yours?
I know that you believed Tara was having an affair with Xander and that your son was Ella's biological father.
and you were partly right.
I mean, she was having an affair with your son, but it wasn't with Xander.
was it, Ed?
Yeah, I figured it out when I saw you two at the CBI.
she was very angry with you, very angry.
pure jealousy.
Oh, my god.
I'm... - Ella's father. Congratulations.
she's a real peach, actually. She's great.
no.
can't be.
I am so sorry. - No!
it was xander!
it was xander.
okay. We'll take that as a confession.
thank you. - Come on. Let's go.
you really don't think I can do anything, do you?
it can't be. - Well, it is.
sorry.
you killed the wrong son.
Xander and Tara seemed too close.
always whispering together in the corners, breaking apart when I'd come into the room.
they were friends.
they were probably talking about her affair with Ed.
so I ordered a paternity test.
the results came back the day of the party.
Ella is not my child, but you know that already, don't you?
what did you expect, dad?!
you treat her like just another one of your possessions, but she's not!
I confronted Xan.
you betrayed me!
he didn't deny it.
why didn't he just deny it?
he assumed you knew it was Ed.
you!
when I think... Of what poor ashley saw... She didn't see anything.
I made it up.
but the teacup-- she was there.
Yes, I know.
but it's all in the wrist.
my good friend senator Aleman is very concerned about my treatment.
of course, you do know the good senator, huh?
Yes. - Chair of the justice committee.
I know him.
Bret Stiles. Good to see you.
looking sharp.
I mean, I'd hate to tell him that you failed to resolve this matter.
so why don't we resolve it right now?
good.
Patrick, Mr. Stiles here says that you antagonized him and conducted yourself in a way that reflected poorly on the bureau.
do you have anything to say?
uh, no. I'm--I'm good, thanks.
actually, there's one thing I'd like to say. - Is this gonna be helpful, Patrick?
probably not. - Okay, then, there you go.
nice talking with you.
what? You're--you're kidding, right? That's it?
no. Do give my best to senator aleman.
is he still seeing that stripper in Bakersfield?
lovely girl.
well, well.
I can see that I've met my match here.
you two-- quite the double act.
I will retreat, chastened.
by the way...
we will find a way to charge you with that attempted bombing.
miss Hightower, shh.
don't push your luck.
so long, Bret.
don't draw the wrong lesson here, Patrick.
I've got Stiles checkmated.
but if a player with real juice came in here, I'd want to see you dance for him.
isn't that what we just did?
you know what I mean.
okay.
and I do love to dance.
where the hell is he, Stace?
don't worry, Mr. Lynch. I'm sure he'll be here soon.
Yeah, well, this is ridiculous.
I mean, he goes on in less than five minutes.
it's all right, Mr. Lynch. He's here.
all right, get him up on stage and I'll tell everybody he's on his way.
okay.
Mr. Brava, I'm afraid we need to hurry.
Mr. Brava, no advance copy of your speech has been released.
why the secrecy? - Well, come hear it, and you'll know.
can you tell us anything about what you're going to say?
you want a sound bite?
fine.
people who traffic in humans are like cockroaches hiding in the dark.
you have to expose 'em to the light.
what do you mean,"expose"? Will you be naming somebody?
Mr. Brava. Wait here.
uh, Mr. Brava. I'll be right back.
Mr. Brava!
that was Hector Brava, the keynote speaker for the human global conference.
Mr. Brava? We really have to...
help me! Somebody, please!
Andy Burnside - Kane county sheriff.
agent Teresa Lisbon. This is Patrick Jane, our consultant.
so the victim's name was Hector Brava.
he was a do-gooder.
ran an organization called the Sheltering Light Foundation.
they fight human trafficking.
there's a conference going on. He was supposed to give some kind of a speech.
so you're the psychic, huh?
no. No such thing as psychics.
all right. Thanks.
looks like cause of death is blunt force trauma to the back of the head.
Yeah, some of my men found a fire extinguisher with blood on it over there.
no, uh, usable prints on it, though.
if he was here to make a speech, what was he doing back here?
this.
it's a text message.
meet me through the staff door. Carmen.
tracking the sender now.
how many Carmens have you I. D.'D at the hotel?
two employees at the hotel, another two were attending the conference.
they all have alibis, though. We're gonna keep looking.
he had his wallet on him, all his credit cards, a lot of money, so you can rule robbery out.
maybe. Where's his speech? - Hmm?
well, you just said Brava was on the way to deliver a speech.
wouldn't he have that speech on his person, or notes at least? Did you find anything?
no.
find out everything you can about the speech.
you got it.
what?
uh, there's a contradiction here.
the murder itself feels improvised - the fire extinguisher, the semipublic location.
but the setup... The text message was planned.
no robbery to speak of.
no assault other than the blow to the head.
it doesn't feel like an anger killing. It feels more like an act of desperation.
the murder wanted to keep Brava from doing something or saying something.
that's just what our psychic said.
your psychic? - Kristina Frye.
you're kidding.
what, you've heard of her?
relax.
don't force the memory.
it'll come, and the details will emerge.
how much you paying her, sheriff?
that's none of your business. - Oh, that much? I'm working for the wrong people.
ms. Frye, hi. It's nice to see you again.
you, too.
thank you. We'll talk later.
so you got the sheriff wrapped around your finger.
sheriff Burnside is a man with an admirably open mind.
mm, yes. He's also a man that likes to watch television with a cat curled up asleep on his lap while his mother sits next to him and knits.
but I'm sure he'd prefer that to remain a secret.
well, I thought you said you weren't psychic.
Oh, he is. He's just not ready to accept it.
actually, it was the cat hair on your pants, lack of wedding ring and your general live-with-mom vibe.
but if you want to believe that his dead uncle Harry came down and whispered it in my ear, then be my guest.
don't you ever get tired of your own cynicism?
Oh, weary as hell.
what's the alternative?
why don't wecb give them a little bit of time to catch up?
sorry about the mom thing.
I still have my practice.
why, you looking for a therapist?
uh, let me think about that.
no. I heard that psychoanalysts are a disease that present themselves as a cure.
and on top of that, you add in ghosts.
reflexive mockery - a sign of a troubled soul, Patrick.
you got bored, didn't you?
got too easy taking their money.
no. I think our gift obliges us to help other people.
Oh, is that what you think? Our gift gives us an obligation to help.
I like that line. I'm gonna use it.
van Pelt says there's a problem tracing the text message that Brava got.
what? - Well, the trail leads to an electronic dead drop.
no way to trace it back. But she's gonna look at his other phones, run down those calls.
and what about the speech?
there's no word yet on whether he had it on him or not.
but we haven't talked to the wife yet. She's inside.
Hector and I knew something like this might happen.
he always said there was too much at stake to waste time worrying.
what were you and your husband worried about?
the traffickers-- people who profit from the enslavement of others.
Hector was tireless in his pursuit of them.
is there anyone you can think of who may have wanted to kill him?
agent, my husband's received half a dozen death threats since Christmas.
if you're asking for names, well, we didn't make a habit of filing the notes.
he was gonna give a speech today. Did he have it on him?
Yes. Why?
well, there was some secrecy surrounding it. Uh, do - do you know what he was gonna talk about?
no, i didn't.
that wasn't unusual.
Hector rarely shared the details of his work with me.
it was his way of protecting me.
the person you need to talk to is Russell Bigelow.
he did research for Hector.
you've been told who I am and what I do?
uh, yes.
my communication with the other side is like a long-distance phone call with a bad connection.
so often the messages I receive are meaningless to me, but not to those with ones who've passed over, okay?
I'm really not big on this, um, supernatural stuff.
you're not alone.
your husband wants me to remind you of something - something that will make you smile.
it's, uh... I'm getting an image of, um... Cherry blossoms?
does that mean anything to you?
Yes.
uh... We were married under a cherry tree.
how could you know that?
he can recall foliage from his wedding day, but he can't tell you who killed him?
it's a bit like waking up from anesthesia. Sometimes it can take a while to get real clarity.
Oh, well, makes sense.
does the name Carmen mean anything to you?
uh, the opera.
Why?
that's pretty. Uh, my turn.
Ilsa... Did your husband ever cheat on you?
did you cheat on him?
why would you ask that?
you--you're very noble and - and dignified. Very stoic.
a Jackie O. Thing going on there.
uh, maybe you don't give a crap. Maybe you're happy he's dead.
maybe not.
I'd like you to leave now.
good idea. Jane, enough fun. Let's go.
Yeah.
thank you for the tea. Very tasty.
nice work.
she was hiding something. I wanted to see what it was.
and what'd you learn?
well, it's early days. - She's got a good arm.
did learn that.
I'm--I'm not so sure this is such a good idea I talk about this stuff.
I-I'm just a researcher, you know? I...
listen, Mr. Bigelow, we understand that you're frightened, but we really need to know what was in that speech.
you don't understand.
look, trafficking generates billions.
I mean, there are governments behind this stuff.
it's like these people can get to anybody. I mean, Hector's death already proves that.
then we can offer you protection, Russell.
but only if you tell us what you know.
if you don't help us, then all the work that you've done to stop these guys will be for nothing.
traffickers use quasi-legit businesses to launder their money around the world.
I watch audit trails.
we made a connection.
that's what's in Hector's speech.
what connection?
have you ever heard of the world anti-trafficking coalition?
one of the backers of the conference, right? - Yeah.
a major charity. It's run by a guy named Christopher Lynch.
they assisted us in shutting down a bunch of networks, but the trafficking continued.
the money just went someplace else.
so it took a while to trace it, but we found out the coalition is a front for a trafficking group.
you know, they used us to shut down their own competition, building themselves a monopoly.
here. That the speech?
my copy.
and why didn't you notify the authorities once you figured out what was going on?
cause Hector said that he wanted to denounce Lynch himself, in public.
I said it was too dangerous, but he just wouldn't listen.
did Brava ever mention anybody named Carmen to you?
no. No, not to me.
Why?
so Bigelow is saying that the people fighting human trafficking were traffickers.
apparently. - All right.
you and Cho go talk to this Lynch. See what he has to say for himself.
okay, you got it.
are you guys joking?
because your humor's in bad taste.
Hector was a close colleague and a good friend.
who was planning to give a speech that would identify your coalition as a front for human traffickers, Mr. Lynch.
he named you specifically.
look, someone is leading you down the garden path, gentlemen.
okay, there's no basis of truth in this.
surely you can see that it's in the traffickers' interest to split us up, get us suspecting each other.
looks like Brava went past suspecting you.
Oh, please. Hector saw conspiracies everywhere.
you know, he liked being in the spotlight.
we read the speech. It makes a pretty convincing case.
okay, look. We're gonna clear this up right now.
I will have my lawyers give you access to all our records, and then you will see that the coalition has nothing to hide.
does the name "Carmen" mean anything to you?
no. - Can you think of anybody who'd want to kill Brava?
Oh, yeah, maybe only a few hundred people.
I ju - uh, wait a second.
one thing.
second night of the convention, I saw Hector having an argument with a man named Tariq Sharif outside the hotel bar, and for my money, the argument was about a woman.
how could you tell?
because I know these guys, and they definitely weren't having a discussion about immigration policy.
how's it coming with Lynch?
says a man called Tariq Sharif was fighting with Brava.
I'm checking for an I. D. on Sharif right now.
I took a look at the records that Lynch's lawyer e-mailed over.
first glance, couldn't find anything that supports Brava's accusations.
I checked Lynch's phone records.
he made a single call right after we left the interview to an anonymous disposable cell.
does it say where it originated?
here's the weird thing... The call ends at a cell tower out in the middle of nowhere.
that is weird. - Right? So we figured maybe we'd go check it out.
all right.
here we go. I got him.
here's Tariq Sharif.
I'll see if anybody's seen Sharif.
excuse me.
he's by the pool.
okay. What are you doing? - Nothing.
Mr. Sharif? - Yes?
we're with the CBI.
agent Lisbon. Mr. Jane.
won't you sit down?
well, don't mind if we do.
I was just telling Mr. Sharif that his spirit is troubled.
there's a wrong that he burns to rectify.
mm, interesting.
Hector was an old friend. I,uh, pushed him to take up the trafficking problem.
naturally, I feel responsible.
they're great glasses. - Yeah.
could - could I try those?
uh, no. - Okay.
Mr. Sharif, why don't you take off the sunglasses?
now.
you got a... owie.
it was a misunderstanding.
he was drunk.
it didn't have anything to do with Ilsa, by any chance?
it was nothing like that. - It was exactly like that.
you have a strong connection with Ilsa - a bond.
see?
Ilsa and I were very close.
uh... By chance, we found ourselves here alone on the first night.
I expressed my deep admiration for her.
she returned my feelings but was afraid to act on it.
Hector found out.
hypocrite that he is, he attacked me.
how is he a hypocrite? - Because he was unfaithful to her.
I did say.
you did.
Mr. Sharif, you were saying that Mr. Brava was unfaithful?
I'm a pacifist, not a coward.
you don't strike me without repercussions.
I went to his suite the night before he died to confront him.
a woman was leaving.
it wasn't Ilsa.
was it someone from the conference?
it wasn't that kind of woman. She was young, pretty, uh, cheap clothes. I assume she was a prostitute.
far as I can tell, this is the only structure within a half mile of the cell tower Lynch's call stopped at.
well, I don't see anything.
Nope. Not a thing.
think they have dogs? - Probably.
Hey, listen.
you have misread the situation, agents.
I am entirely ignorant of whatever it is that you are accusing me of.
you're lying.
we've got the phone records.
you called your goons and told 'em to lock those women up so your guys could escape.
I'm sorry. Goons? What goons? And records can be faked.
no, those women in the truck. - That was you.
Hector Brava. - That was you, too.
you're wrong.
I weep for those poor souls you found.
and as I said, Hector was a dear friend.
what about Carmen?
who's Carmen?
and where's my lawyer?
tough. - Sociopath.
wolf among the sheep.
he's a caught wolf now.
phone call's enough to connect him to about 20 different felony charges, not even counting the homicide. He's going away for a long time.
she likes you, that one. - Which one?
the blonde one. - What?
and you like her.
wha - I'm not so sure I know where this is headed.
you know exactly where this is headed.
do you ever consider dating again?
do you?
how did we get to this point so quickly? - I'm just saying, I think it would be a good thing.
what would?
uh, charging Lynch with Brava's murder.
how close are we?
a confession would help.
well, why don't you ask one of her spirits? I'm sure they'll provide the evidence that's need.
where are you going? - This case is solving itself without me.
I have errands to run.
Lisbon. - Yeah.
christopher Lynch didn't kill Brava.
no. The emotion he was trying to conceal was contempt.
lynch didn't consider him worth killing.
a deeply evil man, but not one who committed this crime.
what if I didn't say "spirits"? What if I said "instincts"?
would that be something you could accept?
Oh, well, maybe.
cause they're telling me to come with you.
are they? Why?
cause the last time you spoke with Ilsa Engels, she threw a teacup at your head.
it was a saucer. It wasn't a teacup.
and who said I'm going to see Ilsa Engels?
tell me that you're not.
she thinks well of me. I can communicate with her husband.
and she'll only talk to you if I'm there.
well, I guess I have no choice but to bring you along with me.
you think you manipulated me into coming with you, don't you?
no, I don't. I think you manipulated me into thinking I manipulated you into coming with me.
okay, I'm just gonna come straight out, and I'm gonna say I'm sorry for the, uh, obnoxious infidelity remarks earlier, and I humbly beg your forgiveness.
sorry.
would you mind talking to us a little bit about Tariq Sharif?
he was drunk.
he said things he shouldn't have said, and I excused myself from his company.
and then your husband punched him in the face.
I didn't tell Hector to hit him, if that's what you're asking.
I won't pretend I'm particularly sad that Hector punched him.
he said things that he - he acted like a pig and an ass.
a pig and an ass? That can't be good.
we need to ask you again about the night before Hector died.
I, um... I had a department meeting. I stayed up in Berkeley.
and, um, is there any chance that a woman could've been visiting with Hector that night?
if Tariq said that, he's lying.
he wouldn't dare say that if Hector was still alive.
it's disgusting.
disgusting.
um, well, I - I guess I should go.
okay. Well, I still have some business to attend to here, so, uh. Yeah, I'm gonna catch a cab out front.
Yeah, I'm gonna catch a cab out front.
okay. - Okay.
Oh, nice call on the cherry blossoms, by the way.
how so?
the wedding photograph - March '97, D.C.
march through to April is the annual cherry blossom festival in D. C.
Patrick, you credit me with far too much cunning.
you're very good. Very compelling.
thank you.
I'll see you later. - Bye.
meet me at the hotel bar.
Cheers. Oh, sweetheart, there you are.
join us. The mentalist uh, I've got us a room, and our friend here...
she's gonna help us explore some boundaries.
no, she's not.
work with me, Teresa.
you're pretty, uh, well, you're pretty adventurous, right?
because my- my lady, she- she gets a little out there at times.
gettin' there now.
let's go upstairs and see. You just have to work things out with Howie.
okay. Barkeep!
how can I help you?
another bottle of the good stuff?
uh, no, thanks.
uh... You're the pimp?
not nice. Well, business manager, then.
concerned friend.
novella says that we have to talk to you.
if it's gonna be the two of you, it's gonna be extra.
sure. She's paying.
I should probably tell you that I am agent for the California bureau of investigation.
she has a gun, too. And handcuffs.
this is entrapment. I want a lawyer.
what you want is to take a look at this picture and tell me if you recognize this man.
Nope. Never seen him.
but that guy - him I recognize.
he was in here getting a girl just the other night.
no. No way.
look, I might not be Denzel, but I do okay.
besides, I couldn't afford a prostitute on my salary, believe me.
not for you. For your boss, Brava.
is that something you did a lot of-- procuring women for him?
the man's dead.
are you seriously gonna drag his name through the mud like this?
I'm not looking to destroy anybody's reputation, Russell.
I just need to know what happened.
Ilsa was back in Berkeley.
he called me and said he need me to do him a favor.
he couldn't go down to the bar himself, because somebody would recognize him.
somebody could've recognized you.
nobody did.
I was lucky.
it was hard for you.
sure.
sure, it would've been easier if he didn't do it at all, but...
look, a-all I could do was just keep him from getting caught.
is there anything you can tell us about the girl?
uh... I think her name was... Claret.
claret. It's French.
what did Brava mean when he said he wanted to make it regular?
well, I mean, not, like, actually regular, because he died and all, but every Thursday afternoon, it was gonna be.
he had a place up in Oakland, he told me.
do you have an address?
sure. And a key, too.
I think it's this one on the left. - Yeah.
so would you ever, uh... You know...
pay for sex? No.
Yeah. It's weird, right?
weird? No. Expensive.
check this out.
Carmen, "bingo."
what do you got?
it's an apartment rented to a Sally Alvarez.
so "Carmen" was just a name she used for work?
Alvarez has been picked up a couple times for soliciting, once for possession.
she skipped on that apartment about a month ago, but her P.O. gave us an address that was good as of last week.
call Burnside. Tell him we're gonna pick her up.
Hey, boss. There was a Carmen Reyes who called Brava on his hotel phone twice the night before he died.
left her name on the hotel messaging system.
there's no record of Sally Alvarez calling the hotel - home or cell.
where did the call originate from?
sunset Horizon motor court in San Desidera.
a Carmen Reyes checked in two days ago. She's still there.
all right. Then we've got two locations to look for her at.
or we have two Carmens.
two Carmens?
two Carmens. - What does that mean, two Carmens?
well, it means things are getting interesting.
Ah, well, as long as it's interesting for you.
I'll go with Van Pelt.
there's just something about motels - old-fashioned and illicit, both at the same time.
is that an invitation?
well, look at you, just showing up like a bad penny.
I had a premonition you'd be here.
Really?
no. Lisbon told me.
upstairs. 204.
grace, you know Kristina?
Yeah.
did your psychic powers tell you to come?
I did have an instinct you were about to get a break in this case.
Oh, I think you might have just made agent Van Pelt's day.
we're looking for Carmen Reyes.
actually, we have two addresses for her. This is just one of 'em.
her real name is Sally Alvarez.
wait a second. Sally Alvarez. I know that name.
she communicated with me a short time ago. She's passed over.
I'm pretty sure she's still in there.
open it up.
step back, sir.
she's down.
Hey, Cho. - We found Sally Alvarez.
she's been dead for about six hours. Blunt force trauma to the head.
she's dead?
Oh, my god. That's amazing. - Why?
Kristina Frye said Sally passed over. She predicted it.
she did? - Yes.
can I have that? Thank you. Cho, please do not believe this mystic mumbo jumbo.
gullible Grace buried the lead.
I was right. There were two Carmens.
there were? - That's right, and we have the real one right here.
she claims to be Hector Brava's daughter.
a year ago, my mother was diagnosed with cancer.
uh, it got bad very fast.
she was gone in less than a month.
before she died, she told me Hector Brava was my father.
and after the funeral, I wrote to him.
I never heard back.
I thought maybe he'd forgotten her.
I wrote there was nothing I wanted from him, only to meet the man who was my father.
he still didn't answer?
I saw somewhere that he was delivering a speech here.
I thought I'd go confront him.
you were angry.
I wanted to talk to him. - Did you?
when?
the morning he died?
the night before.
I went to his suite.
what happened?
he let me in.
he was friendly, until I told him I was his daughter.
he got very upset and angry.
he said, I could not be his daughter.
he said, he already met his daughter, and what kind of scam was I trying to play?
he turned so pale and shook all over.
he threw me out of the room and locked the door, so I left.
and that was last time you saw him?
on the news, it said what happened.
I didn't know what to do.
and what about the text message? Did you send that?
I don't have a phone.
so is she telling the truth?
I'm not sure.
Brava's spirit is deeply conflicted. I can't get a clear reading.
what are you using, dial-up?
my question is, if she's telling the truth, why was Sally Alvarez pretending to be Carmen Reyes?
I talked to Bigelow.
he kept a record of all work correspondences but didn't have anything to do with Brava's personal letters.
there's no way to know if her story checks out or not.
if Brava's her father, she's got motive.
she's not the only one.
I could never have children.
is it true?
is she really Hector's daughter?
we don't know, ma'am.
she's agreed to take a paternity test. I think she might be telling the truth.
so you think she might be the one that killed Hector.
well, maybe... And then maybe it was you.
I have to say, ma'am, i-it's pretty hard to believe that you didn't know about his behavior.
Yes, I knew.
Hector was a passionate and heroic man who devoted himself to helping others.
his flaws were correspondingly oversized.
and his behavior was okay with you?
I accepted it.
the good in him outweighed the bad.
if he'd told me, maybe I could've done something to prevent it.
maybe I could've saved him. - What for?
how could you not want to get away from his serial philandering, from the prison of your loveless marriage?
that's not true! I loved my husband, and he loved me!
well, maybe we can get in contact with him now.
you could do that, couldn't you?
it would certainly clear up a few things.
would you do that?
would you talk to my husband?
Yes, Ilsa.
what are you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing?
okay, so Van Pelt is bringing Carmen.
Rigsby's gonna bring Richard Bigelow.
Cho is gonna pick up Tariq Sharif and Stacey.
so we're all set.
what's all set for what?
we're all set for, uh, Kristina Frye to contact Hector Brava's spirit.
I need everybody connected with his passing.
okay. Well, uh, I guess...
now listen, just make sure Brava's spirit has a thirst for revenge.
he wants to put some kind of a curse on the killer, you know what I mean?
that kind of thing. And then I'll take it from there.
I can't do that.
Yes, you can. It is a necessary lie.
I can only contact Hector Brava's spirit and speak as he wants me to.
to do otherwise would be to abuse my gift.
everything okay? - Yep. Everything's good. It's perfect.
are we starting now?
almost. - I'll just get the door.
welcome. Come on in.
thanks for coming.
it was your husband's request.
your husband's daughter.
well, thank you all for coming.
Patrick will be assisting me.
so in order for this to work, I need everybody to be calm and focused.
I want you to look at the candle in the center of the table.
focus on the flame and concentrate on Hector.
now... He's here.
I can feel him.
hector... Who do you wish to speak to?
the killer's here.
know this - Hector Brava says... Vengeance will come.
your blood will spill... Before the rising sun.
I sense him.
I-I can almost see an image.
I-it's hazy.
Oh, it... Ohh, it's as if it could just...
Hector. Hector, wait. Stop. Don't go.
there it is.
a door.
employees only.
and an empty hallway.
footsteps... Close... Close...
I see you.
I'm sorry. Man, you scared me to death with that.
it's okay. You can relax, Bigelow. It's over.
I know it was you that did it.
what, because I got frantic and fell out of my chair?
because you managed Brava's correspondence, you were the first one to read Carmen's letters, yes?
you set Brava up on a date with Sally and had her pretend to be Carmen, and then you told Brava that he had sex with his own daughter.
Lord.
and then the real deal showed up, so you faked Carmen's message, and when Brava walked through that service door, you killed him.
and you killed poor Sally Alvarez to cover your tracks.
and now you'll pay for the crime you committed.
your blood will spill before the sun rises.
that part I'm not so sure about.
it came in the mail.
just out of the blue. Just a...
letter describing an affair Brava had 20 years ago, naming the woman and the place.
and that came from Carmen Reyes. The real Carmen.
that gave you all the facts you need-- things about the affair that only Brava and Carmen's mother would know.
right? - Yeah.
so why'd you do it?
why put a man through that kind of suffering?
was it the money? Or did you just like having Brava in your power?
do you know I've been running numbers on trafficking for Brava and setting him up on his dates for, like, five years?
and do you think that he ever, ever thanked me?
said, " I'm sorry"?
said, " I'm gonna make this up to you one day, Russell"?
I knew Sally from a whorehouse up in northern California.
I told her if she pretend to be Carmen, we could blackmail Brava and split the money.
the letter just gave us everything we need to make Brava think that she was the real deal.
and he was not one for asking a whole lot of questions, so...
then the real Carmen showed up.
Yeah. He called me as soon as she left his room, freaked.
so I played dumb.
but then the next morning, he called me and he said," we need to talk."
it was pretty clear he figured it out.
and so you went to the hotel and texted Brava from the service hallway.
I just - I just wanted to keep him quiet.
and Sally Alvarez?
you had to keep her quiet, too, right?
you know, I was a really good researcher.
I bet.
come on.
agent Van Pelt, you wanted to see me?
Oh, yeah. Hi, Carmen. I just wanted to go over a few things in your statement.
let's go in the kitchen.
so... Nice working with you.
Yeah.
Yeah, you were very good back there.
uh, you almost had me with the whole "i can't misuse my gift for fear of what might happen" bit.
I did what I said I would.
I spoke the words the spirits told me to speak, nothing more.
Really?
don't you know me by now?
don't you know I wouldn't lie about a thing like that?
ms. Frye, thank you so much.
we couldn't have closed this one without you.
well, that's debatable.
you're welcome.
although I have to say it looks like the spirits got it wrong.
I guess being dead doesn't make you infallible.
well, what do you mean?
the killer was caught, and justice was served.
sure. But no blood was spilled.
look, he's right there.
murder!
Oh, come on.
that was pure luck. Admit it.
if you say so. - Oh, I know so.
the dead are dead.
you can't talk to them.
and yet I do.
yeah... You're very good.
I go this way.
okay.
it was nice seeing you again. - You, too.
Bye.
Yes.
that's with a "k," right?
Yes.
you wanna go get a coffee?
I'll drink tea myself, but you can drink as much coffee as you want.
Yeah, I'd like that.
I can't right now, though. I - I have to be somewhere else.
uh, maybe some other time?
some other time.
sorry, not " maybe." Definitely. Sometime soon.
call me.
Jane? You in there?
I'm up. I'm up.
homicide in San Francisco.
Cho and Rigsby are already on their way.
did you sleep here?
no, I was working.
it looks like you were sleeping.
well, I programmed my, uh, dreams to work on the Red John case.
Oh, well, then make sure you put in for overtime.
Ah, healthy skepticism. I like it. But it could work.
mendeleev saw the entire periodic table in his dream.
that's nice for him. Jane?
shall we?
as a friend...
this doesn't look good.
keeps me going.
there's evidence of a physical confrontation, and this is where he ended up.
he was on his back when the shots were fired.
eight to ten rounds to the head. - Whew. What head?
Yeah. Ew.
two motel guests heard muffled pops - around 1: 00 a. m., figured it was city traffic. - No defense wounds. You'd think - he would've at least put up his hands to shield his face. - Or it depends on how hard he fell.
forensics recovered the casings.
9 millimeter. Also collected a cigarette butt - and some red fibers around the body. - You woke me for this.
this man is a sociopath. He should've been in prison.
he was, full pardon two days ago. Name's Henry Dahl.
convicted nine years ago in the rape and murder of one Jennie Winter.
was a lifer at Del Norte until a new DNA test set him free.
how'd you peg him as an inmate? - Give me a break.
a classic rooster build... massive upper body, skinny legs.
jaundiced skin, probably hepatitis...
see from the dirty needle tattoo on his elbow, spiderweb representing the passage of time.
Wh... where are you going?
I'm tired, and I don't really care who killed this creep.
he was innocent.
Meh. He made instruments of death out of toothpicks.
I know you, don't I? Are you with homicide?
right now I'm with you, unless, uh, of course, are you with homicide?
did you know it cost taxpayers $2. 4 million to convict Henry Dahl in the murder of Jennie Winter?
no kidding. That's a lot of money. - Now they'll have to spend millions more finding and convicting Dahl's killer because the state set a hardened criminal free.
how many man hours will you waste chasing - Henry Dahl's killer? - Not too many.
anything usable? - Um, maybe.
get this.
and I'm here to tell you Henry Dahl deserved what he got.
even the CBI agrees with me the premiere law enforcement agency of California.
take a look at one of their agents, just two hours after the gruesome body was discovered in a south San Francisco motel room.
not in too big a rush to catch the killer, is he?
we've identified this man as Patrick Jane, the CBI's top criminal consultant.
sleep tight tonight, Mr. Jane. I know I will.
this isn't unfamiliar territory to me.
a paid consultant mistaking state contracts for a country club where he can do as he pleases.
he was tired because he was here all night working on the Red John case. It's completely bogus.
Yeah, I know it's bogus. But that's not how it looks.
it looks like he puked in the fish tank. - Kinda does, yeah.
the attorney general has enough to worry about with the murder of a wrongly imprisoned man.
I need Jane awake on this.
to be honest, I'm more concerned about her behavior than I am about his. The police never released Dahl's identity to the press.
so what's a famous cable TV host doing in front of the motel?
Karen Cross' production company footed the bill for Henry Dahl's motel room.
Dahl had driven in from Lodi - to appear as a guest on her talk show today. - Explains how she knew he was there.
wait. Their connection runs deeper than that.
before Cross joined trial TV, she was a state prosecutor with 102 violent felony convictions, no losses.
guess who one of those convictions was? - Hello, Dahl-Y.
don't do that. - Why would Dahl appear on the national talk show of the lawyer who put him away?
notoriety. Payback. Women.
well, Cross can't be happy about Dahl's name being cleared.
ruins her perfect record. - Agreed. Jane and I will go talk to her.
now did Dahl have a local residence? - A halfway house in Lodi.
you and Cho, start driving. See what you find there. - Grab the keys.
Hey, what's the matter? - Oh. I had a lunch appointment.
well, I can drive to Lodi with Cho. - Oh, no. I couldn't ask you to do that.
don't worry about it. I'll clear it with Lisbon.
you know, you go do your lunch thing. - I hope you're hungry. Grace.
Hey. Rigsby.
Hey. So you should grab a jacket.
I hitched us a ride on the tac team chopper. - We're flying to lunch?
tac team was heading up north anyhow, so they're gonna drop us off at this great picnic spot I know on the river.
I mean, you said you had a couple hours, right? - Yeah. Thank you so much. I owe you one.
it's okay. We'll stop for big gulps.
how you doing? You all right?
eh, it's a little chilly in here, no?
excuse me. Hi. I'm Agent Lisbon.
I think you know my colleague, Patrick Jane.
well, he's probably taking a nap.
he gets nervous on TV sets.
I imagine so, considering what happened to his family after his last talk show appearance.
even I know better than to taunt a serial killer on air.
then you should know better than to taunt the CBI, because...
I'm a person of interest. I get it.
so let me make this easy for you.
Yes, I was outraged that Henry Dahl was set free.
did I shoot him? No. I was in Edit Bay 4 at the time of his murder. The log includes - a contact number for the editor who was with me. - Why'd you invite Henry on your show?
the state may have let Henry go, but my show is tougher than any court of law.
I was gonna nail him to the cross. - Karen Cross?
you've seen my promos?
read the trial coverage, too. It was all smoke and mirrors.
you whipped the jury into a frenzy - to cover for a lack of physical evidence. - Two witnesses put Dahl at the scene.
that doesn't make him a killer.
you caught a break when the DNA test from the rape kit came back as inconclusive.
the new test excludes Dahl as the perpetrator.
you don't trust DNA?
I don't trust anything coming out of the justice system.
that's why I left. - I heard you left because you were gonna be fired for ethical violations.
nothing stops me from following my instincts, Agent Lisbon.
I won't apologize for that.
I spent six months deposing and questioning Henry.
I'm telling you for a fact, that man was a reptile.
shrink, right?
excuse me?
the vest.
the tea.
Karen Cross always invites a shrink to comfort the grieving mother. I'm Jodi Dahl.
Oh. I'm sorry for your loss.
don't you worry about me.
I've been letting go of Henry for years.
excuse me, hon.
tea?
it's a hug in a... cup.
no, no, thank you.
I take it you're family, too.
Max Winter.
Max winter.
the widower of the victim.
true victim.
my wife's name was Jennie.
there is nothing about you that indicates loss.
no scars of aged pain. Bravo.
corner seat says you're wary.
need to control your environment.
in most people, that creates tension.
but your breathing is relaxed.
what's your trick, Max?
it's... inner peace.
the kind of peace you get when you shoot your wife's killer?
Henry was innocent, it seems.
well, if that's true, the man that raped and cut your wife up is still out there.
that doesn't bother you?
Jennifer's life ended abruptly.
could've been a drunk driver, could've been a meteorite.
anger is unhelpful and unproductive.
well, I don't know.
some people... It's, uh, it's invigorating.
I'm sorry I don't fit your image of the tragic husband.
you ask where my peace comes from.
it's called... reconciliation.
I can't undo what happened to my wife, but for the sake of my son Jackson,
I can decide how I wanna live thereafter.
so I forgive Henry...
or... whoever it was who killed Jennie.
I actually forgave them long ago.
let's get you wired for sound, Mr. Winter.
excuse me.
Where's Miss Dahl?
okay. Bring her to the stage.
this was the scene nine years ago, when Henry Dahl was attacked before a pretrial hearing by the husband of the woman whose throat he was accused of cutting.
Oh!
three deputies were guarding Henry Dahl that day.
now that was the Max I knew.
he would be dancing a jig after hearing Henry Dahl was dead.
but am I to understand you actually forgave Dahl before this so-called new D. N.A. Evidence came to light?
it's called reconciliation, Karen. - Meh.
reconciliation? Yeah, reconciliation. In my case...
Oh, I'm familiar with what reconciliation means.
reconciliation is basically when family members of victims... they waltz over to the prison, they decide they're gonna forgive this person who murdered their wife or children. I just don't buy it, Max.
he was only here for two nights. I hardly saw him.
when I did, he was just so happy to be free. Who wouldn't be?
did Mr. Dahl have any visitors?
Yeah, the first night out.
some woman... she dropped by for a few hours.
not bad-looking either. The guy didn't waste much time.
you catch her name?
no. Sorry. Here we go.
thank you.
thanks a lot.
Oh, we can take it from here. Thank you.
you're welcome.
well, someone was looking for something.
thank you, captain, obvious.
three hours of brooding silence, then sarcasm.
it's like we're married.
sorry, Cho. It's just special Agent Craig O'laughlin and his... Chopper.
what's she see in that guy anyway?
Ivy League degree in criminology, 6 years in the 101st airborne, and a black belt in WuShu from a real ShaoLin Temple.
Yeah, thanks, buddy. Whatever.
Aah! Cho, under the bed!
what are you doing?! - Just go! Go!
bet they don't teach that at a ShaoLin Temple.
Wow. Hi.
I thought you were my dad.
no.
what an amazing phenomenon flying machines frozen in mid-air.
I kinda feel sorry for 'em.
did... did you do all this?
um, no, my... my dad does.
I just help out.
you're Max's son. I... I saw you at the talk show.
Jackson, right?
I... I... I'm... I'm looking for your dad.
who are you?
you... you a cop or something?
no. Too many laws to uphold.
but I... I do work with the police.
don't touch that, please. It's... it's not cured yet.
it feels okay to me. - It needs two more hours.
can... can you go now?
uh, look, my... my dad's not at the house.
I don't know where he is.
sure, you do. You just don't want me to know.
is he hiding something?
no, he's not hiding anything.
are you?
no. Of course not.
your dad doesn't seem like the kind of man who would ask you to lie.
Artie Mock.
multiple arrests for assault, battery, battery with injury...
and today, aggravated assault against a police officer.
I'm sorry.
did I hurt you?
it was just a mattress.
now what's your relationship with Henry Dahl?
friends.
we met in junior college.
we were art majors.
why'd you break into his room? - I was looking for my money.
he owes me 22 large, plus nine years' interest.
where were you last night?
last night?
I was working graveyard at the plant.
and, no, I didn't kill him.
I mean, now I ain't ever gonna see what's mine. - What did Dahl owe you for?
statute of limitations on drug dealing is what, six years?
six years.
in that case, Henry and I ran a small business in college.
we... We weren't very good at art, so we started distributing cocaine.
that's a natural transition. - That's what we said.
no, H... Henry was storing a shipment, and... and he gets popped for murder.
2 kilos.
I visited him in prison, and he tells me that the... the stash gets confiscated, so I let it go.
but then the day that Henry gets out of prison, he starts flossing about taking his girlfriend to Jamaica, so I'm thinking he's still got those drugs hidden.
his girl? - Mm-hmm.
Henry'd been out for two days. When did he find a girlfriend?
she found him, in prison.
they were pen pals.
according to Del Norte,
Henry Dahl had just one name on his approved e-mail list...
a woman named Betsy Meyers from Lodi, his hometown.
Lodi... Yeah, I was just there today. Long drive. Hot.
she and Dahl had a thing going in high school.
she reached out to him two months ago, - rekindled their romance. But there's just one problem. - Betsy's married?
Yes, to a Sean Meyers. He's a factory worker.
they've been together for seven years. - Somebody should question him.
agreed. - Someone who hasn't been to Lodi yet.
I want to see how willingly they come to us.
let's call them in in the morning. In the meantime, there's no shortage of suspects who hated Henry Dahl.
23 people threatened his life during his murder trial, most of which were friends or family of the alleged victim. Here's a list of those names, courtesy of our cable television friend, Miss Cross.
we got a lot of eyes on us on this one.
I want you to stay late and run down these names.
Bravo.
Oh.
I had a feeling I'd see you again.
takes a confident man to visit a shooting range - when he's still a murder suspect. - Or an innocent one. I never got your name.
I'm sorry? - Never got your name.
uh, Patrick Jane. - What kind of gun do you use, Patrick?
Oh, no. I don't... I don't use. - No? That's, uh, a little strange for a policeman, isn't it?
me, I... I like a well-balanced . 45...
best combination of power, accuracy, and kick.
whoa. Hey, hey. Careful. Whoa. Whoa, watch the muzzle sweep.
you never point at anything you don't want to shoot.
so how can I help you, Patrick?
well, um, I'm just curious to hear how you did it.
how I did what?
forgave your wife's killer.
Ah. So you believe me now.
well, I wouldn't get carried away,
but I... I did find out that you've become quite the, uh, evangelist for reconciliation, corporate talks and all.
you know why I came here in the first place?
I manage real estate funds.
I never touched a weapon in my life.
but then Jennie was butchered, and I needed a release.
at first, I pretended the targets were Henry Dahl, and now, they're just targets.
it's a discipline. Very Zen.
you found the gift of forgiveness through firearms.
Yeah, shooting helped me cope.
my son led me to forgiveness.
all this rage inside me, that lust for vengeance...
I could see I was scaring Jackson.
I didn't want to lose him, too.
lo and behold, Henry Dahl was exonerated, like a sign from above.
Yes. Exactly. I just wish I had forgiven him sooner.
do you have children, Patrick?
no.
try it.
no better pain relief.
I'm not in pain.
no?
I sense pain.
Ah, it's nothing a gun will fix.
by the way, I don't own a gun.
I just rent them while I'm here.
and I was with my son, at home, at the time of the murder.
just, uh... in case you're interested.
it's gonna get loud. - Yeah. Oh.
I'll just step back here.
Henry had a beautiful spirit.
that whole bad boy thing that was always just an act.
he even wanted to try acting when he got out of prison.
how did you know that?
he told me... in his E-mails.
did you know that your wife was exchanging e-mails with a convicted felon?
Yeah, I was taking dictation for her. What do you think? No.
Betsy, according to the prison, you'd been writing Henry for two months.
why'd you reach out to him? - Yeah, why did you?
you've had a first love, right?
you know that feeling?
it never really goes away, not totally.
I never thought that Henry killed anyone, and when I read that there was new D. N.A. Evidence,
I just wanted to say "woot, woot," you know, as a friend.
does this sound like friends?
dear Henry, wild thoughts in my head.
I know I shouldn't wonder what your body feels like now, - but it's all I... " - Okay, stop. All right?
why are you doing this to me?
my husband is sitting right here.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
she is so full of it.
what? She wrote some stuff to a guy. There's worse crimes.
Betsy, tell me the truth.
you heard. She's in love with him. - No, that's not true.
I really just started writing him as a friend.
we were arguing so much.
and he knew me so well.
he started saying all the things to me that you stopped saying years ago.
did you have any contact with him after he was released?
no. Only in e-mails.
Betsy, we showed a photo of you to the manager of the halfway house Henry was living in.
he identified you as the woman who visited Henry the day after his release.
you slept with him?
Oh, hush.
I didn't say anything.
what is this, marriage counsel? - They're suspects in the shooting.
these two?
Really? Hmm.
um...
can I see your gun?
hmm?
where were the 2 of you at 1: 00 a. m?
drinking beers at the Lamplighter.
Hi. Patrick Jane. Very nice to meet you. Hold that, please. - Whoa - Okay. What? - I'm sorry. For you here.
what the hell are you doing?!
it's okay. Rigsby took the bullets out.
muzzle sweeps. They have no idea how to handle a gun. - Give me a break.
van Pelt, run down Betsy and Sean's alibis.
you, outside!
excuse me.
so you're a gun expert now?
no, not me. Max Winter. You should see him shoot.
did he shoot Dahl? What caliber was the murder weapon?
9 millimeter. - Yeah, Max prefers a . 45.
Oh, shucks. I guess he's innocent.
here's a revised suspect list. Max is still on it.
and I hope you got some sleep last night, - because we're going to Lodi to run interviews. - I just got back from Lodi.
van leaves in 20 minutes. Be outside.
Patrick Jane.
I didn't recognize you yesterday at the crime scene.
you were quite the psychic once. - Oh, there's no such thing as psychics.
so you say now.
your cold reading of a serial killer on live television led to the brutal murder of your wife and daughter.
Oh. Really? Thanks for reminding me. - Mr. Jane, I am on your side.
you were a victim of violent crime, and now you help others. That's wonderful.
don't tell me you don't have the psychic stuff.
what are you doing for the CBI if you're not psychic?
are you scamming them, Mr. Jane? - No, Karen, I am not.
well, prove it. Identify Dahl's killer.
well, if I had carte blanche to do things my way,
I would do just that, but they don't give me carte blanche.
the CBI won't, but I will. Deputy?
you've been served.
you are hereby commanded to testify before a studio audience of your peers.
what do you need to solve this crime?
name it.
well, I suppose, uh...
I need the help of those that are affected by Dahl's murder.
those two you had on your show yesterday would do.
I'll bring them back.
and, uh,
I guess, uh, I need suspects.
Yeah. Make sure these people are in the audience.
give 'em an appearance fee, whatever it takes.
beats driving back to Lodi.
you saw him here first... the sleeping CBI agent.
well, get ready to meet him.
Patrick Jane... Psychic detective? Tragic victim?
you be the judge today at 3: 00, when Mr. Jane taps his mind's eye to reveal who killed Henry Dahl.
well, where is he?
we're five minutes to air.
without him, it's just a rehash of yesterday's show. - I've left messages everywhere.
Oh.
Oh. Sorry I'm late. I had to stop by a bed and bath boutique.
Mr. Jane, there is a reason that I asked you to arrive two hours early.
I need to walk you through the lineup. - Are all my suspects here?
Yeah, they're in the first two rows. Stellar.
now the lineup... I'll start with my State of the Union, - and then we're just gonna roll a clip to introduce you. - A clip?
uh, y... Well, just some old footage. - My Red John talk show appearance.
Oh, no, just save... save your reaction for on-air.
I really want you to relive the moment... - Excuse me, Karen. I gotta hand out candles.
candles? Wait. What... what candles? - Hey, folks.
I hope Lodi is treating you well.
a little treat from Karen Cross.
hand them out. One each.
here you go. Pass that back to him, please. Thank you.
Ah, Jackson.
here to see the old man again, are you? Here.
a candle.
we need you onstage now. - Oh, I have to hand these out. They're for my act.
unless, uh, what are you doing?
everybody must have one.
okay? I need these. Thank you.
Patrick. - Max.
you've probably read stories about psychics who help the police solve murder cases.
well, today, we're gonna take a peek behind the mystic's veil to see how that's done.
to introduce our featured guest, we have a dramatic video clip of his last talk show.
uh, Karen, sorry to interrupt. - Uh, Mr. Jane, I'll get to you in a minute.
could you please sit down? - You... you... you wanted to tell me something about the lineup.
I forget. The lineup... Did you tell me?
the lineup, I forget. Forget the lineup.
what is the lineup?
uh... I'm... Let me remind you.
ladies and gentlemen, it is time to unmask the shooter.
what you have all just witnessed is a remarkable piece of mental tomfoolery from our psychic guest star, Patrick Jane.
however, this is not Mr. Jane's show, so I'm gonna ask Mr. Jane again to please sit down.
I'm sorry. I forget. Whose show is it? Whose show? I forget.
I forget whose show. Forget whose... - W... will you stop doing that? You are a guest here.
well, actually, no. I was, uh, summoned.
are you sure this is how you want to play it?
you really wanna make yourself a sorrier spectacle?
Oh, is there anyone more sorry than you, Karen, with your morbid interest in all things shocking or repulsive?
you pretend to be a victim's advocate, but you're a vulture, preying on the carrion of human suffering.
are you gonna give me that carte blanche - you promised me or not? - Yeah, buddy, go.
Yeah.
you gonna give me that carte blanche? Hmm?
I feel like getting me some carte blanche.
okay, Mr. Jane, let the psychic wonders unfurl.
there's no such thing as psychics, Karen, only entertainers skilled in the art of deception.
but I'm happy to, uh, perform a psychic "demonstration."
usually begins with a fantastic claim such as Henry Dahl's killer is sitting in this room right now.
and then, uh, any good psychic would make sure that the front row is full of actual police suspects, which I believe that we have done for you today.
then he might go on and explain
how, uh, a... a spirit that has crossed over still has the power to manipulate energy in our world...
creating noises, moving objects, and sometimes even starting fires...
and that is what Henry Dahl is gonna do for us right now.
Henry Dahl will light a candle to reveal his shooter.
dim the lights, please.
Oh, I can't wait for this. - That's the spirit. That's your candle.
Oh. There is one other thing.
a truly world-class psychic would invite police officials up on the stage to make an arrest once the killer has been unmasked.
and today, we are very fortunate to have some, uh, conveniently telegenic CBI officers...
uh, Agent Wayne Rigsby,
and the pocket rocket, the dynamite, heavily armed, cute as a button Agent Teresa Lisbon.
ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause.
ladies and gentlemen, please, raise your candles high above your heads while we wait for Henry Dahl to reveal his shooter.
speak to us, Henry.
speak to us from beyond the great beyond.
this is ridiculous...
Ah.
wait.
jackson Winter, of course.
uh, you think it was me?
Henry Dahl was convicted of killing your mother,
but you didn't buy the DNA Test that set him free, did you?
what are you doing? - Of course he didn't believe the DNA.
I presented an ironclad case.
and the owner of a certain firing range I visited tells me that Jackson, in fact, does like to shoot guns.
prefers a 9 millimeter, same caliber as the murder weapon.
look... I didn't shoot anyone, okay? Dad...
what's more, forensics matched red fibers from the murder scene with carpet fibers from the firing range.
stop it. You stop this.
my son didn't do anything.
casting blame on him like this... It'll ruin his life. - I know.
then don't do it.
don't let me.
all right. You leave him alone.
it was me.
I shot Henry Dahl.
or he is just lying to protect his son.
agents, arrest him. - I'm not lying.
he's not lying. His son told me.
what are you talking about? No, I didn't.
epoxy takes 12 hours to cure.
yesterday you told me that that model only needed two more hours.
that puts you working in the garage in the middle of the night. Your son wasn't asleep.
he heard you leaving. That's why he wanted to protect you, right?
all right, let him be.
I pulled the trigger, and I can prove it.
you'll find his prints on the gun.
ballistics will match the casings. - How did you obtain it?
gun trafficker eight years ago.
you purchased an illegal weapon eight years ago. Why?
Dahl was a lifer in a state pen.
you had no way of knowing he'd get out.
Oh, you wanna stop talking now? That's fine.
all bets are off.
we're gonna take you and your son into custody.
no, j... just...
just wait.
I knew Henry was gonna get out because I'm the one who set him free.
how'd you know?
well, he's a man of infinite patience and suppressed rage.
his wife's killer had to die by his own hand.
he had no choice.
okay, you're gonna have to help me out a little bit.
how did you set Dahl free?
I'm a fund manager at a real estate investment firm.
I used one fund to buy up old warehouses...
safe investment, convert 'em into condos...
and that's how my firm came to own a certain bay area warehouse used for evidence storage.
including DNA. - It took since months to pull the condo permits.
I used that time to gain access to the property and I swapped out Dahl's DNA sample.
Dahl passes retest. You kill Dahl.
you should sell the book rights.
hold on. My client never said he killed Henry Dahl.
your client confessed on basic cable.
to shooting Dahl.
hello.
I shot that piece of filth.
I shot him right in the face.
but I didn't kill Henry Dahl.
he was already dead.
that's a development.
how do you know Dahl was dead?
back of his head was busted open.
he was lying in a pool of blood. - Maybe he was still breathing.
no. I checked for a pulse.
I don't buy it.
if you knew Dahl was dead, why'd you shoot him nine times?
because he murdered my wife.
Uh-oh.
what?
he's telling the truth.
with no head left to speak of, the coroner can't make a definitely call, but he did say there was less blood loss than expected, - which supports postmortem gunshots. - Oh, in that case...
let's go pick out the actual killer, shall we?
it's kind of obvious now, isn't it?
I mean, shooting is a crime of planning. That's Max.
but a blow to the head? - Crime of passion.
a lot of emotions were flying around that interrogation room yesterday.
the jilted husband, Sean Meyers... I felt his pain.
Meyers said he didn't know his wife was having an affair with the victim. Maybe he was lying.
what about his alibi? - He alibi'ed out for the 1: 00 a. m. shooting, but a blow to the head would have occurred earlier.
it's like watching a symphony orchestra come together.
dead river bridge.
Sean Meyers' cell phone server got a fix on his signal somewhere around here.
why would he come out here?
van Pelt talked to the apartment manager.
he heard a couple fighting. Betsy got in her car.
Sean took off after her. She could be his next victim.
well, that's one theory. - Get back!
Betsy! - Stay away from me!
get out of there!
okay.
we're with the CBI. What's going on here?
Oh, they were up there when we arrived.
we don't know what's going on yet, but it looks like an attempted assault.
he's gonna reach her soon.
we may have to shoot to stop him.
get back!
stay away from me!
Betsy! - If you shoot him, you'll have two victims.
she just went up there to see about jumping.
he's trying to save her. Can I use that?
thank you.
uh, Betsy?
if you're gonna jump, make sure to dive, head first.
Hey. - Jane.
from that height, you'll just shatter bones and suffer massive internal injuries.
make sure you dive, headfirst.
I just want this all to end now!
I know.
what do I have to live for?
um, nothing.
your husband killed Henry Dahl. He's going to prison.
you killed Henry?
he was gonna hurt you.
you did that for me, baby?
Oh!
Ohh.
Ah, ain't love grand?
thank you.
Yeah, she was never gonna jump anyway.
she just wanted the attention.
I found the e-mails on her laptop two weeks ago.
my entire world fell apart.
I couldn't lose Betsy. I just couldn't.
when Henry got out of prison,
I went to the motel, but I went to talk with him.
I'm a free man now.
means free to love, too.
she's married.
I'll share her with you. I don't mind.
you learn to share in lockdown.
where are my damn cigarettes?
I'll pay you.
I'll give you money to stay away from Betsy. - How much?
I have $3, 200 saved.
I've got millions coming my way once the state reimburses me for all that time in jail.
sorry.
I plan on having a little fun with your wife.
maybe I'll...
slash her throat...
like I did the last one.
damn, where are those cigarettes?
I just wanted to protect her.
this is all my fault. I'm so sorry.
all right, time to go.
I'll write you every day.
I suppose, from your perspective, it's a shame that neither man will serve any real time.
Oh, will they not?
well, who knows who really killed Henry Dahl?
well, prosecution will say Sean Meyers.
he struck him in the head. - Ah, but did he kill him?
Max may well have lied to protect himself.
maybe Dahl was still alive.
Max's attorneys point the finger at Sean, and Sean's attorneys point at Max,
and in the end, they both walk.
Yep, that could happen.
Ah, maybe we could save everyone a lot of time and money and let 'em both walk now.
after all, the killer did get what he deserved.
that's common sense.
but, uh, common sense carries very little weight in the DA's office.
pity.
what you doing there, Rigsby? - Nothing.
he's trying to light the candle with the power of his mind. - No, I wasn't.
is that one of those candles Jane used on the talk show?
look, I know how he did that. - Oh, yeah?
a candlewick dipped in liquid phosphorous will spontaneously burst into flame when it dries. The oxygen hits the phosphorous.
Jane must've dipped the kid's candle in the stuff before he gave it to him. Now the real trick, though, is in the timing, which Jane nailed.
Hey. Where are we going for lunch today?
Napa. - Nice.
Bye, guys.
uh, excuse me, Patrick. I was looking for you.
it seems they're gonna drop the attempted murder charge.
the, uh, evidence tampering is another matter, but my attorney's gonna work out a deal for probation.
well, that's... that's very good for Jackson.
Yeah. I'm told that somebody high up in your office was very influential with the DA.
Mm. Wasn't me. Good to see you.
Yeah. But I brought you a gift anyway.
Oh, listen, thank you, but I... I can't...
please? Please.
okay.
should I open it now? - No.
was it worth it?
was what worth it?
the man that killed your wife no longer exists.
the time you took pursuing him, the pain, the sacrifice... was it worth it?
Yes, it was.
thank you.
Jane? You in there?
I'm up. I'm up.
homicide in san francisco. Cho and rigsby are already on their way.
did you sleep here?
no, I was working.
it looks like you were sleeping.
well, I programmed my, uh, dreams to work on the red John case.
Oh, well, then make sure you put in for overtime.
Ah, healthy skepticism. I like it. But it could work.
mendeleev saw the entire periodic table in his dream.
that's nice for him. Jane?
shall we? - As a friend...
this doesn't look good.
keeps me going.
paradise
there's evidence of a physical confrontation, and this is where he ended up.
he was on his back when the shots were fired.
eight to ten rounds to the head.
Whew. What head? - Yeah.
two motel guests heard ffleled ps around 1: 00 a. m. figured it was city traffic.
no defense wounds. You'd think he would've at least put up his hands to shield his face.
or it depends on how hard he fell.
forensics recovered the casings. 9 millimeter.
also collected a cigarette butt and some red fibers around the body.
you woke me for this?
this man is a sociopath. He should've been in prison.
he was. Full pardon two days ago. Name's Henry Dahl.
convicted nine years ago in the rape and murder of one Jennie Winter.
was a lifer at Delnorte until a new d. n.a. Test set him free.
how'd you peg him as an inmate?
give me a break. A classic rooster build - Massive upper body, skinny legs.
jaundiced skin, probably hepatitisc.
from the dirty needle tattoo on his elbow.
spiderweb representing the passage of time.
Wh-where are you going?
I'm tired, and I don't really care who killed this creep.
he was innocent. - Meh.
he made instruments of death out of toothpicks.
I know you, don't I? Are you with homicide?
right now I'm with you, unless, uh, of course, are you with homicide?
did you know it cost taxpayers $2. 4 million to convict Henry Dahl in the murder of Jennie Winter?
no kidding. That's a lot of money.
now they'll have to spend millions more finding and convicting Dahl's killer because the state set a h
how many man hours will you waste chasing Henry Dahl's killer?
not too many.
anything usable?
get this.
and I'm here to tell you Henry Dahl deserved what he got.
even the CBI agrees with me.
the premiere law enforcement agency of California.
take a look at one of their agents just two hours after the gruesome body was discovered in a south San Francisco motel room.
not in too big a rush to catch the killer, is he?
we've identified this man as Patrick Jane, the CBI's top criminal consultant.
sleep tight tonight, Mr. Jane. I know I will.
this isn't unfamiliar territory to me.
a paid consultant mistaking state contracts for a country club where he can do as he pleases.
he was tired because he was here all night working on the Red John case.
it's completely bogus.
Yeah, I know it's bogus.
but that's not how it looks.
it looks like he puked in the fish tank.
kinda does, yeah.
the attorney general has enough to worry about with the murder of a wrongly imprisoned man.
I need jane awake on this.
to be honest, I'm more concerned about her behavior than I am about his.
the police never released Dahl's identity to the pss.
so what's a famous cable tv host doing in front of the motel?
Karen Cross' production company footed the bill for Henry Dahl's motel room.
Dahl had driven in from Lodi to appear as a guest on her talk show today.
explains how she knew he was there.
wait. Their connection runs deeper than that.
before Cross joined trial tv, she was a state prosecutor with 102 violent felony convictions, no losses.
guess who one of those convictions was?
Hello, Dahl-y. - Don't do that.
why would Dahl appear on the national talk show of the lawyer who put him away?
notoriety. Payback. Women.
well, Cross can't be happy about Dahl's name being cleared.
ruins her perfect record.
agreed. Jane and I will go talk to her.
now did Dahl have a local residence?
a halfway house in Lodi.
you and Cho, start driving. See what you find there.
grab the keys.
Hey, what's the matter?
Oh. I had a lunch appointment.
well, I can drive to Lodi with Cho.
Oh, no. I couldn't ask you to do that.
don't worry about it. I'll clear it with Lisbon.
you know, you go do your lunch thing.
I hope you're hungry.
so you should grab a jacket.
I hitched us a ride on the tac team chopper.
we're flying to lunch?
tac team was heading up north anyhow, so they're gonna drop us off at this great picnic spot I know on the river.
I mean, you said you had a couple hours, right?
Yeah. Thank you so much. I owe you one.
it's okay. We'll stop for big gulps.
how you doing? You all right?
eh, it's a little chilly in here, no?
excuse me. Hi. I'm agent Lisbon.
I think you know my colleague, Patrick Jane.
well, he's probably taking a nap.
he gets nervous on tv sets.
I imagine so, considering what happened to his family after his last talk show appearance.
even I know better than to taunt a serial killer on air.
then you should know better than to taunt the CBI, because.
I'm a person of interest. I get it.
so let me make this easy for you.
Yes, I was outraged that Henry Dahl was set free.
did I shoot him? No.
I was in edit bay 4 at the time of his murder.
the log includes a contact number for the editor who was with me.
why'd you invite Henry on your show?
the state may have let Henry go, but my show is tougher than any court of law.
I was gonna nail him to the cross.
Karen Cross?
you've seen my promos?
read the trial coverage, too. It was all smoke and mirrors.
you whipped the jury into a frenzy to cover for a lack of physical evidence.
two witnesses put Dahl at the scene.
that doesn't make him a killer.
you caught a break when the d. n.a. Test from the rape kit came back as inconclusive.
the new test excludes Dahl as the perpetrator. You don't trust d. n.a?
I don't trust anything coming out of the justice system.
that's why I left.
I heard you left because you were gonna be fired for ethical violations.
nothing stops me from following my instincts, agent Lisbon.
I won't apologize for that.
I spent six months deposing and questioning Henry.
I'm telling you for a fact, that man was a reptile.
shrink, right? - Excuse me?
the vest. The tea.
Karen Cross always invites a shrink to comfort the grieving mother.
I'm Jodi Dahl.
Oh. I'm sorry for your loss.
don't you worry about me.
I've been letting go of Henry for years.
excuse me, hon.
tea?
it's a hug in a... Cup.
no, no, thank you.
I take it you're family, too.
the widower of the victim.
true victim.
my wife's name was Jennie.
there is nothing about you that indicates loss.
no scars of aged pain. Bravo.
corner seat says you're wary. Need to control your environment.
in most people, that creates tension.
but your breathing is relaxed.
what's your trick, Max?
it's... Inner peace.
the kind of peace you get when you shoot your wife's killer?
Henry was innocent, it seems.
well, if that's true, then that raped and cut your wife up is still out there.
that doesn't bother you?
Jennifer's life ended abruptly.
could've been a drunk driver, could've been a meteorite.
anger is unhelpful and unproductive.
well, I don't know.
some people-it's, uh, it's invigorating.
I'm sorry I don't fit your image of the tragic husband.
you ask where my peace comes from.
it's called... Reconciliation.
I can't undo what happened to my wife, but for the sake of my son Jackson,
I can decide how I wanna live thereafter.
so I forgive Henry...
or... Whoever it was who killed Jennie.
I actually forgave them long ago.
let's get you wired for sound, Mr. Winter.
excuse me. - Where's Miss Dahl?
okay. Bring her to the stage.
this was the scene nine years ago, when Henry Dahl was attacked before a pretrial hearing by the husband of the woman whose throat he was accused of cutting.
three deputies were guarding Henry Dahl that day.
now that was the Max I knew.
he would be dancing a jig after hearing Henry Dahl was dead.
but am I to understand you actually forgave Dahl before this so-called new d. n.a. Evidence came to light?
it's called reconciliation, Karen. - Meh.
reconciliation? - Yeah, reconciliation. In my case.
Oh, I'm familiar with what reconciliation means.
reconciliation is basically when family members of victims.
they waltz over to the prison, they decide they're gonna forgive this person who murdered their wife or children.
I just don't buy it, Max.
Henry
he was only here for two nights. I hardly saw him.
when I did, he was just so happy to be free. Who wouldn't be?
did Mr. Dahl have any visitors?
Yeah, the first night out. Some woman-she dropped by for a few hours.
not bad-looking either.
the guy didn't waste much time.
you catch her name? - No. Sorry. Here we go.
thank you. - Thanks a lot.
Oh, we can take it from here. Thank you. - You're welcome.
well, someone was looking for something.
thank you, captain obvious.
three hours of brooding silence, then sarcasm.
it's like we're married.
sorry, Cho. It's just special agent craig and his... Chopper.
what's she see in that guy anyway?
Ivy league degree in criminology, 6 years in the 101st airborne, and a black belt in wushu from a real shaolin temple.
Yeah, thanks, buddy. Whatever.
Cho, under the bed!
what are you doing?! - Just go! Go!
bet they don't teach that at a shaolin temple.
Max
Hi. I thought you were my dad.
no.
what...
an amazing phenomenon.
flying machines frozen...
in mid-air.
I kinda feel sorry for 'em. Did-did you do all this?
um, no, my-my dad does. I just help out.
you're Max's son. I - I saw you at the talk show.
Jackson, right?
I- I-i'm-i'm looking for your dad.
who are you?
you-you a cop or something?
no. Too many laws to uphold.
but I-I do work with the police.
don't touch that, please. It's-it's not cured yet.
it feels okay to me.
it needs two more hours.
epoxy
can-can you go now?
uh, look, my-my dad's not at the house. I don't know where he is.
sure, you do. You just don't want me to know.
is he hiding something?
no, he's not hiding anything.
are you? - No. Of course not.
your dad doesn't seem like the kind of man who would ask you to lie.
multiple arrests for assault, battery, battery with injury...
and today, aggravated assault against a police officer.
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
it was just a mattress.
now what's your relationship with Henry Dahl?
friends.
we met in junior college.
we were art majors.
why'd you break into his room?
I was looking for my money.
he owes me 22 large, plus nine years' interest.
where were you last night?
last night?
I was working graveyard at the plant.
and, no, I didn't kill him.
I mean, now I ain't ever gonna see what's mine.
what did Dahl owe you for?
statute of limitations on drug dealing is what, six years?
six years.
in that case, Henry and I ran a small business in college.
we-we weren't very good at art, so we started distributing cocaine.
that's a natural transition. - That's what we said.
no, H-Henry was storing a shipment, and-and he gets popped for murder. 2 kilos.
I visited him in prison, and he tells me that the-the stash gets confiscated, so I let it go.
but then the day that henry gets out of prison, he starts flossing about taking his girlfriend to jJamaica, so I'm thinking he's still got those drugs hidden.
his girl?
Henry'd been out for two days. When did he find a girlfriend?
she found him, in prison.
they were pen pals.
according to Del Norte, Henry Dahl had just one name on his approved e-mail list.
a woman named betsy meyers from Lodi, his hometown.
Lodi-yeah, I was just there today.
long drive. Hot.
she and Dahl had a thing going in high school.
she reached out to him two months ago, rekindled their romance.
but there's just one problem. - Betsy's married?
Yes, to a Sean Meyers. He's a factory worker.
they've been together for seven years.
somebody should question him. - Agreed.
someone who hasn't been to Lodi yet.
I want to see how willingly they come to us.
let's call them in in the morning.
in the meantime, there's no shortage of suspects who hated Henry Dahl.
23 people threatened his life during his murder trial, most of which were friends or family of the alleged victim.
here's a list of those names, courtesy of our cable television friend, Miss Cross.
we got a lot of eyes on us on this one.
I want you to stay late and run down these names.
Bravo.
I had a feeling i'd see you again.
takes a confident man to visit a shooting range when he's still a murder suspect.
or an innocent one. I never got your name.
I'm sorry? - Never got your name.
uh, Patrick Jane.
what kind of gun do you use, patrick?
Oh, no. I don't-I don't use.
no? That's, uh, a little strange for a policeman, isn't it?
me, I-I like a well-balanced.
45 - Best combination of power, accuracy, and kick.
Hey, hey. Careful.
whoa, watch the muzzle sweep.
you never point at anything you don't want to shoot.
so... How can I help you, Patrick?
well, um, I'm just curious to hear how you did it.
how I did what? - Forgave your wife's killer.
so you believe me now. - Well, I wouldn't get carried away, but I-I did find out that you've become quite the, uh, evangelist for reconciliation, corporate talks and all.
you know why I came here in the first place?
I manage real estate funds. I never touched a weapon in my life.
but then Jennie was butchered, and I needed release.
at first, I pretended the targets were Henry Dahl, and now, they're just targets.
it's a discipline. Very zen.
you found the gift of forgiveness through firearms.
Yeah, shooting helped me cope. My son led me to forgiveness.
all this rage inside me, that lust for vengeance.
I could see I was scaring Jackson.
I didn't want to lose him, too.
lo and behold, Henry Dahl was exonerated, like a sign from above.
Yes. Exactly. I just wish I had forgiven him sooner.
do you have children, Patrick?
no.
try it.
no better pain relief.
I'm not in pain. - no?
I sense pain.
Ah, it's nothing a gun will fix.
by the way, don't own a gun.
I just rent them while I'm here.
and I was with my son, at home, at the time of the murder.
just, uh...
in case you're interested.
it's gonna get loud.
I'll just step back here.
Henry had a beautiful spirit.
that whole bad boy thing - That was always just an act.
he even wanted to try acting when he got out of prison.
how did you know that? - He told me... In his e-mails.
did you know that your wife was exchanging e-mails with a convicted felon?
Yeah, I was taking dictation for her.
what do you think? No.
Betsy, according to the prison, you'd been writing henry for two months.
why'd you reach out to him?
Yeah, why did you?
you've had a first love, right? You know that feeling?
it never really goes away, not totally.
I never thought that Henry killed anyone, and when I read that there was new d. n.a. Evidence,
I just wanted to say "woot, woot," you know, as a friend.
does this sound like friends?
dear Henry, wild thoughts in my head.
I know I shouldn't wonder what your body feels like now, but it's all I
okay, stop. All right?
why are you doing this to me?
my husband is sitting right here.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
she is so full of it.
what? She wrote some stuff to a guy. There's worse crimes.
Betsy, tell me the truth.
you heard. She's in love with him.
no, that's not true.
I really just started writing him as a friend.
we were arguing so much.
and he knew me so well.
he started saying all the things to me that you stopped saying years ago.
did you have any contact with him after he was released?
no. Only in e-mails.
Betsy, we showed a photo of you to the manager of the halfway house henry was living in.
he identified you as the woman who visited henry the day after his release.
you slept with him?
Oh, hush. - I didn't say anything.
what is this, marriage counsel?
they're suspects in the shooting.
these two? Really?
can I see your gun?
where were the 2 of you at 1: 00 a. m?
drinking beers at the lamplighter.
Hi. Patrick Jane.
very nice to meet you. Hold that, please.
what? Sorry. Here. Okay. What the hell are you doing?!
it's okay. Rigsby took the bullets out. Muzzle sweeps.
they have no idea how to handle a gun.
give me a break. Van Pelt, run down Betsy and Sean's alibis.
you, outside! - Excuse me.
so you're a gun expert now?
no, not me. Max Winter.
you should see him shoot.
did he shoot Dahl? - What caliber was the murder weapon?
9 millimeter.
Yeah, Max prefers a. 45.
Oh, shucks. I guess he's innocent.
here's a revised suspect list. Max is still on it.
and I hope you got some sleep last night, because we're going to Lodi to run interviews.
I just got back from Lodi.
van leaves in 20 minutes. Be outside.
Patrick Jane. I didn't recognize you yesterday at the crime scene.
you were quite the psychic once.
Oh, there's no such thing as psychics.
so you say now.
your cold reading of a serial killer on live television led to the brutal murder of your wife and daughter.
Really? Thanks for reminding me.
Mr. Jane, I am on your side.
you were a victim of violent crime, and now you help others. That's wonderful.
don't tell me you don't have the psychic stuff.
what are you doing for the cbi if you're not psychic?
are you scamming them, Mr. Jane?
no, Karen, I am not.
well, prove it. Identify Dahl's killer.
well, if I had carte blanche to do things my way, I would do just that, but they don't give me carte blanche.
the cbi won't, but I will.
deputy?
you've been served.
you are hereby commanded to testify before a studio audience of your peers.
what do you need to solve this crime? Name it.
well, I suppose, uh...
I need the help of those that are affected by Dahl's murder.
those two you had on your show yesterday would do.
I'll bring them back.
and, uh, I guess, uh, I need suspects.
Yeah.
make sure these people are in the audience.
give 'em an appearance fee, whatever it takes.
beats driving back to Lodi.
you saw him here first - The sleeping cbi agent.
well, get ready to meet him.
Patrick Jane-psychic detective? Tragic victim?
you be the judge today at 3: 00, when Mr. Jane taps his mind's eye to reveal who killed Henry Dahl.
well, where is he?
we're five minutes to air. Without him, it's just a rehash of yesterday's show.
I've left messages everywhere.
sorry I'm late. I had to stop by a bed and bath boutique.
Mr. Jane, there is a reason that I asked you to arrive two hours early.
I need to walk you through the lineup.
are all my suspects here?
Yeah, they're in the first two rows.
now the lineup-I'll start with my state of the union, and then we're just gonna roll a clip to introduce you.
a clip?
uh, y-well, just some old footage.
my Red John talk show appearance.- Oh, no, just save-save your reaction for on-air.
I really want you to relive the moment - excuse me, Karen. I gotta hand out candles.
candles? Wait. What-what candles?
Hey, folks.
I hope Lodi is treating you well.
a little treat from Karen Cross.
hand them out.
one each.
here you go. Pass that back to him, please. Thank you.
Ah, Jackson.
here to see the old man again, are you?
here.
a candle.
we need you onstage now.
Oh, I have to hand these out. They're for my act.
unless, uh, what are you doing?
everybody must have one.
okay? I need these. Thank you.
you've probably read stories about psychics who help the police solve murder cases.
well, today, we're gonna take a peek behind the mystic's veil to see how that's done.
to introduce our featured guest, we have a dramatic video clip of his last talk show.
uh, Karen, sorry to interrupt.
uh, Mr. Jane, I'll get to you in a minute. Could you please sit down?
You-you-you wanted to tell me something about the lineup.
I forget.
the lineup - Did you tell me?
the lineup, I forget.
forget the lineup.
what is the lineup?
uh...I'm
let me remind you. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to unmask the shooter.
what you have all just witnessed is a remarkable piece of mental tomfoolery from our psychic guest star, Patrick Jane.
however, this is not Mr. Jane's show, so I'm gonna ask Mr. Jane again to please sit down.
I'm sorry. I forget. Whose show is it?
whose show? I forget.
I forget whose show. Forget whose- w- will you stop doing that?
you are a guest here.
well, actually, no. I was, uh, summoned.
are you sure this is how you want to play it?
you really wanna make yourself a sorrier spectacle?
Oh, is there anyone more sorry than you, Karen, with your morbid interest in all things shocking or repulsive?
you pretend to be a victim's advocate, but you're a vulture, preying on the carrion of human suffering.
are you gonna give me that carte blanche you promised me or not?
Yeah, buddy, go.
Yeah.
you gonna give me that carte blanche? Hmm?
I feel like getting me some carte blanche.
okay, Mr. Jane, let the psychic wonders unfurl.
there's no such thing as psychics, Karen, only entertainers skilled in the art of deception.
but I'm happy to, uh, perform a psychic "demonstration."
usually begins with a fantastic claim such as Henry Dahl's killer is sitting in this room right now.
and then, uh, any good psychic would make sure that the front row is full of actual police suspects, which I believe that we have done for you today.
then he might go on and explain how, uh, a-a spirit that has crossed over still has the power to manipulate energy in our world.
creating noises, moving objects, and sometimes even starting fires.
and that is what Henry Dahl is gonna do for us right now.
Henry Dahl will light a candle to reveal his shooter.
dim the lights, please.
Oh, I can't wait for this.
that's the spirit. That's your candle.
there is one other thing.
a truly world-class psychic would invite police officials up on the stage to make an arrest once the killer has been unmasked.
and today, we are very fortunate to have some, uh, conveniently telegenic cbi officers.
uh, agent Wayne Rigsby, and the pocket rocket, the dynamite, heavily armed, cute as a button agent Teresa Lisbon.
ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause.
ladies and gentlemen, please, raise your candles high above your heads while we wait for Henry Dahl to reveal his shooter.
speak to us, Henry.
speak to us from beyond the great beyond.
this is ridiculous.
Ah. Wait.
jackson Winter, of course.
uh, you think it was me?
Henry Dahl was convicted of killing your mother, but you didn't buy the d. n.a. Test that set him free, did you?
what are you doing? - Of course he didn't believe the d. n.a.
I presented an ironclad case.
and the owner of a certain firing range I visited tells me that Jackson, in fact, does like to shoot guns.
prefers a 9 millimeter, same caliber as the murder weapon.
look...I didn't shoot anyone, okay? Dad.
what's more, forensics matched red fibers from the murder scene with carpet fibers from the firing range.
stop it. You stop this.
my son didn't do anything.
casting blame on him like this-it'll ruin his life.
I know.
then don't do it.
don't let me.
all right. You leave him alone. It was me.
I shot Henry Dahl.
or he is just lying to protect his son.
agents, arrest him.
I'm not lying. - He's not lying.
his son told me.
what are you talking about? No, I didn't.
epoxy takes 12 hours to cure.
yesterday you told me that that model only needed two more hours.
that puts you working in the garage in the middle of the night.
your son wasn't asleep. He heard you leaving.
that's why he wanted to protect you, right?
all right, let him be.
I pulled the trigger, and I can prove it.
you'll find his prints on the gun.
ballistics will match the casings.
how did you obtain it?
gun trafficker eight years ago.
you purchased an illegal weapon eight years ago. Why?
Dahl was a lifer in a state pen. You had no way of knowing he'd get out.
Oh, you wanna stop talking now? That's fine.
all bets are off.
we're gonna take you and your son into custody.
no, j-just...Just wait.
I knew Henry was gonna get out because I'm the one who set him free.
how'd you know?
well, he's a man of infinite patience and suppressed rage.
his wife's killer had to die by his own hand.
he had no choice.
okay, you're gonna have to help me out a little bit. How did you set Dahl free?
I'm a fund manager at a real estate investment firm.
I used one fund to buy up old warehouses.
safe investment, convert 'em into condos.
and that's how my firm came to own a certain bay area warehouse used for evidence storage.
including d. n.a.
it took since months to pull the condo permits.
I used that time to gain access to the property and I swapped out Dahl's d. n.a. Sample.
Dahl passes retest. You kill dahl. You should sell the book rights.
hold on. My client never said he killed Henry Dahl.
your client confessed on basic cable.
to shooting Dahl.
hello.
I shot that piece of filth.
I shot him right in the face.
but I didn't kill Henry Dahl.
he was already dead.
that's a development.
how do you know Dahl was dead?
back of his head was busted open. He was lying in a pool of blood.
maybe he was still breathing.
no. I checked for a pulse.
I don't buy it.
if you knew Dahl was dead, why'd you shoot him nine times?
because he murdered my wife.
Uh-oh.
what?
he's telling the truth.
with no head left to speak of, the coroner can't make a definitely call, but he did say there was less blood loss than expected, which supports postmortem gunshots.
Oh, in that case...
let's go pick out the actual killer, shall we?
it's kind of obvious now, isn't it?
I mean, shooting is a crime of planning. That's max.
he built an entire fleet of planes with his hands.
but a blow to the head?
crime of passion.
a lot of emotions were flying around that interrogation room yesterday.
the jilted husband, Sean Meyers-I felt his pain.
Meyers said he didn't know his wife was having an affair with the victim. Maybe he was lying.
what about his alibi?
he alibi'ed out for the 1: 00 a. m.Shooting, but a blow to the head would have occurred earlier.
it's like watching a symphony orchestra come together.
dead river bridge.
Sean Meyers' cell phone server got a fix on his signal somewhere around here.
why would he come out here?
van Pelt talked to the apartment manager. He heard a couple fighting.
Betsy got in her car. Sean took off after her.
she could be his next victim.
well, that's one theory.
get back! - Betsy!
stay away from me!
okay.
we're with the cbi. What's going on here?
Oh, they were up there when we arrived.
we don't know what's going on yet, but it looks like an attempted assault.
he's gonna reach her soon.
we may have to shoot to stop him.
get back!
stay away from me!
if you shoot him, you'll have two victims.
she just went up there to see about jumping. He's trying to save her.
can I use that?
uh, Betsy?
if you're gonna jump, make sure to dive, headfirst.
from that height, you'll just shatter bones and suffer massive internal injuries.
make sure you dive, headfirst.
I just want this all to end now!
I know.
what do I have to live for?
um, nothing.
your husband killed Henry Dahl.
he's going to prison.
you killed Henry?
he was gonna hurt you.
you did that for me, baby?
got you.
Ah, ain't love grand?
thank you.
Yeah, she was never gonna jump anyway.
she just wanted the attention.
I found the e-mails on her laptop two weeks ago.
my entire world fell apart.
I couldn't lose Betsy. I just couldn't.
when henry got out of prison, I went to the motel, but I went to talk with him.
I'm a free man now.
means free to love, too.
she's married.
I'll share her with you.
I don't mind.
you learn to share...In lockdown.
where are my damn cigarettes?
I'll pay you.
I'll give you money to stay away from Betsy.
how much?
I have $3, 200 saved.
I've got millions coming my way once the state reimburses me for all that time in jail.
sorry.
I plan on having a little fun with your wife.
maybe I'll...
slash her throat...
like I did the last one.
damn, where are those cigarettes?
I just wanted to protect her.
this is all my fault. I'm so sorry.
all right, time to go.
I'll write you every day.
I suppose, from your perspective, it's a shame that neither man will serve any real time.
Oh, will they not?
well, who knows who really killed Henry Dahl?
well, prosecution will say Sean Meyers. He struck him in the head.
Ah, but did he kill him?
Max may well have lied to protect himself.
maybe Dahl was still alive.
Max's attorneys point the finger at Sean, and Sean's attorneys point at Max, and in the end, they both walk.
Yep, that could happen.
Ah, maybe we could save everyone a lot of time and money and let 'em both walk now.
after all, the killer did get what he deserved.
that's common sense.
but, uh, common sense carries very little weight in the d. a.'s office.
pity.
what you doing there, Rigsby?
nothing.
he's trying to light the candle with the power of his mind.
no, I wasn't.
is that one of those candles Jane used on the talk show?
look, I know how he did that. - Oh, yeah?
a candlewick dipped in liquid phosphorous will spontaneously burst into flame when it dries.
the oxygen hits the phosphorous.
Jane must've dipped the kid's candle in the stuff before he gave it to him.
now the real trick, though, is in the timing, which Jane nailed.
Hey. Where are we going for lunch today?
Napa. - Nice.
Bye, guys.
uh, excuse me, Patrick. I was looking for you.
it seems they're gonna drop the attempted murder charge.
the, uh, evidence tampering is another matter, but my attorney's gonna work out a deal for probation.
well, that's - That's very good for Jackson.
Yeah. I'm told that somebody high up in your office was very influential with the d. a.
wasn't me. Good to see you.
Yeah. But brought you a gift anyway.
Oh, listen, thank you, but I-I can't- Please? Please.
okay.
should I open it now?
no.
was it worth it?
was what worth it?
the man that killed your wife no longer exists.
the time you took pursuing him, the pain, the sacrifice - Was it worth it?
Yes, it was.
thank you.
do you think you could persuade your sister to make at least a token appearance?
I doubt it.
please try.
sure, mom. - Okay.
Abby, are you awake?
Yeah. All right. All right.
I'm heading through the front entrance right now. What's your 20?
Hey, boss.
victim's name is Austin Marr. 23. Multiple stab wounds. Killed in the guesthouse last night around 2: 00 a. m.
what's with all the security?
well, the house belongs to a federal judge named Pauline Fitzwilliam.
her mother just died. Lot of v. i.p. s are here for the wake.
stiff security for a wake.
Where's Jane?
who knows? He can catch up when he gets here.
I was looking for Abby.
I didn't even know Austin was in the house.
he doesn't live here?
no. He's Abby's boyfriend.
he's sweet and gentle.
who would do this to him?
I need you to stay with me, Sophie.
okay. - Does Austin have family in the area?
no.
Sophie, do you know where Austin works?
I'm not sure.
he's... He's an illustrator for children's books.
and how was his relationship with Abby?
they were in love.
Austin treated her like gold.
when was the last time you saw your sister?
yesterday afternoon.
where is she? What's happened to her?
that's what we're trying to figure out.
we'll let you know as soon as find anything out. Thank you for your time.
but she's okay, right? 'Cause she's my baby sister.
we'll let you know. - Okay.
I talked to security.
they say they've got a sealed perimeter around the estate.
no one goes in or out unless it's through them.
Abby came in yesterday morning at 8: 40, but there's no record that she left.
so she's still in the house?
that's the thing. Local p. d. And security searched the property - Every building, every room.
they can't find her anywhere.
well, maybe she left with someone. - Security's saying no.
they check everyone that leaves. They even search their cars.
so Abby's missing, but security says she never left?
I was having such a good day.
Cho, check out Austin - Home, work, other friends.
van Pelt, get with security.
I want the names of everybody who was on the property at the time of death, and I want to talk to 'em.
on it. - Uh, and if you see Jane, tell him he's officially tardy.
all metals items in the plastic bins.
uh, I'm with cbi. I'm in a hurry. I'm just gonna go around.
Where's your badge?
uh... You just grabbed my arm.
Oh, maybe you didn't hear me. Marcus Whiteside-security chief here. Where's your badge?
that's my badge. Where's your badge? - Okay, then. Now go through the gate.
are we gonna have a problem here?
no. Not at all. I'm just asking.
through the gate.
I'm one of the good guys here, man. I'm-i'm here to help.
Familyly friends, cbi-everyone goes through the gate.
got it? - I got it.
that means you go through the gate, too?
Absolutely. - Okay.
then... Marcus, please, be my guest. After you. The least I could do.
uh, you know, I-I may...- Can I just... Please? Thank you.
seems to be working.
come on. I want a bite.
come on. Just give me a bite. - No.
you don't deserve it. I just want one bite.
well, maybe I'm just gonna have to take it then.
then take it.
no?
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
you hear that? She loves me.
I know what's happened here.
what's that, judge?
three months ago I sentenced a man named Raymond Tubbs to 40 year without parole.
he's a white supremacist, runs a gang that's been robbing banks up and down the coast.
Mr. Tubbs swore he would kill me and my family, so obviously someone working for him killed poor Austin and took Abby.
but your security team says nobody entered the compound.
well, they also said Abby must still be here, and they've searched and haven't found her, so obviously they're wrong in some respects.
Where's Tubbs doing time?
Folsom.
that doesn't stop him.
last month he sent a member of his gang to break into our house.
that's when we stepped up security.
did your forensics get anything from the crime scene?
ma'am, we prefer not to give details of our investigation until it's completed.
agent, I was a d. a. For 12 years.
I can pick up the phone and find out what you've got, or you can just tell me.
partial prints on the murder weapon and Austin's blood.
we're running it now.
fine. You'll find that it belongs to someone working for Tubbs.
you track him, you will find Abby.
we'll look into Tubbs, but there are other avenues to explore.
such as?
ma'am, I - in a matter of course, we looked into Abby's background.
she has issues with drug and alcohol abuse.
had issues.
she's been clean for months, and what has that to do with this situation?
parents aren't always the first to know about a relapse, and drug dealers are dangerous company.
Abby was clean and sober.
and Austin? - He was the same.
and how was their relationship lately?
it was good.
there were wounds on his face - Fingernail scratches, which suggests he had a fight with a female shortly before he was killed.
are you suggesting that Abby fought with Austin and then killed him?
like I said, ma'am, other avenues to explore.
agent, if my daughter comes to harm because you frittered away your time looking into her personal life, your career is over. Do you understand me?
ma'am, I understand your distress during this difficult time, but we'll go wherever this investigation takes us. It's my duty.
can I help you?
well, that depends.
who are you?
uh, I just... Oh.
and you are?
Patrick Jane, cbi.
Oh, I-I spoke with one of your colleagues- Uh, Van Pelt, I believe.
does that mean you've had enough of questions?
uh... N-no.
that-that's not what I- Good. Where were you last night?
uh... Here.
uh, I-in bed.
I... I was tired from working all day and took a sleeping pill.
I'm not actually a cop.
I'm what you, uh, would refer to as a... Consultant.
funny. - You have a distinctly medical air.
are you a family doctor?
uh, Ethel's. Uh, I took care of her the last year or so.
Ethel was 93. I think, all things considered, we gave her a reasonably peaceful end.
so what do you think's happened to Abby?
who?
Abigail Fitzwilliam - Uh, Ethel's granddaughter.
Oh, Abby. Yeah. What about her?
she's missing, I-isn't she?
is she?
do the police know?
you're joking again. - Yes.
how would you describe Abby?
Oh, uh... A good-hearted young woman.
full of life.
vivacious.
uh, excuse me.
I have a... Um, please?
Lisbon, hello.
Jane, where are you?
I'm just talking with the family doctor here.
he says our missing girl is an unstable nymphomaniacal stoner.
interesting, no? - Uh, I didn't say that.
Yes, you did. You practically screamed it.
I'm at the front door now. Meet me here.
Yeah. I-I'll be right there.
thanks for your time.
no sign of the girl?
no, and the security people say she couldn't have possibly left the property without their knowledge.
we should see if she was sleeping with any of the security people.
it's a thought. And the mom says neo-nazis staged a raid, but security said nobody came on the property, so puzzle that out.
give me a minute.
Cho. Yeah, I need you to check out Raymond Tubbs.
he's in federal prison in Folsom.
Yeah, talk to him, see what he knows about the Fitzwilliams.
also, did you get anything on those fingerprints? Let me know.
okay. Minute's up. What's the answer?
that was not a minute. That was less than 30 seconds, even.
you are something else. - Agent Lisbon, you said that, um, if you found anything, you'd let me know.
have you? - No, Sophie. I'm sorry.
I got it. - What?
you asked me to puzzle it out. I puzzled it out.
what? What is it?
uh, well, there's been no ransom demand, so that rules out abduction, leaves three options for your sister's disappearance.
one, she was killed and her body was removed from the compound.
two, she was killed and her body was hidden on the compound.
or three, she killed Austin and fled the scene.
no, that can't be.
you're hiding something.
what? No?
obviously something about your sister. What is it?
no.
Oh, come on. You can tell me.
you don't know Abby.
she would never hurt Austin.
you want to believe that, but you know it's not true, don't you?
you ever notice that feeling, thathysical l well feeling you get when you know you should say or do something and you don't?
heart pounds, headache, backache.
you can feel better... Immediately... If you tell the truth...
right now.
yesterday I went to the guesthouse to see Abby.
Austin was there, and they were arguing.
I have never seen them like that.
Abby tried to leave, and Austin started to shake her, and he was yelling at her and shaking her.
what did Abby do?
she hit him in the face. - Yeah.
he was bleeding.
then what happened?
I don't know. I left.
excuse me. - Of course.
well, thank you, Sophie.
that was very valuable.
now you should take a little lie-down, maybe catch up on some sleep.
okay.
when you wake up, you're gonna feel a lot better.
thank you.
forensics got a match from the prints from the knife that was used as the murder weapon.
they're Abby's.
I'm telling you, Abby did not leave that compound.
you and your men searched the house and the grounds. She wasn't there?
is it possible that there's a hole in the system?
there are cameras, regular patrols, and motion sensors. It's just not possible.
we'll have to search the place again is all. We must've missed her.
first things first.
could somebody in the family have helped Abby escape?
none of them have access to the security system, not even Pauline.
what about your men? Are any of them vulnerabilities?
they're ex-military and law enforcement.
I handpicked them myself.
we're gonna need a list of their names. - You're wasting your time.
you should be talking to all the people who were on the compound when austin was killed.
we have talked to them. Six in total, not including Abby.
Pauline, Sophie, Ed Saban, two maids, Ethel's cousin Ruth.
we're looking into all of them, but right now what I am interested in is finding Abby.
so Abby and Austin have a fight, and then later on that night, she kills him?
that's what it looks like.
still doesn't explain how she got off the estate.
when we find Abby, we'll have our answer.
Whiteside sent me a list of the names of his security team.
run background checks on them. See if anything comes up.
Yeah, you got it. - Hey, boss.
Abby Fitzwilliam used her credit card three hours ago at a boutique in San Francisco.
the store faxed over an itemized receipt.
let's go check it out.
"Marin life" magazine?
it's a good read.
Abby liked to party, just like the doctor said.
she and her posse are all through this.
the point is... - I'm exploring the world of the suspect.
well, you enjoy exploring.
we'll go get on her trail and arrest her.
what did Abby buy at the store?
um... Skirt suit, blazer, and a tumi bag. Why?
no reason.
she was in a few hours ago.
okay... She spent $800 on a skirt suit, blazer, and a handbag. ?
OK, Uh... - Here's her picture.
Oh, yeah. I remember. Blonder, though.
was she with anyone? - No.
do you remember anything else about her?
fierce shoes.
she left an address. Jacket needed altering.
do you want it?
Yes.
put your badge away. If she thinks we're cops, she might run.
I don't feel like running.
we have a delivery from Couturier. You want to open the door?
she's lying.
Abby Fitzwilliam, you're under arrest. - I'm not Abby.
put your hands in the air now!
Lisbon, Grace, where's your manners?
this is Daniella, Abby's best friend.
come in. Have a seat.
okay. You win. How'd you find Daniella?
what's my prize?
Abby Fitzwilliam is a party girl with a rebellious streak.
she dresses like one. Lots of animal prints.
the receipt. - Skirt suit, blazer, tumi bag.
very east coast prep.
no way Abby would've bought any of that.
daniella is the only one of Abby's friends with that, uh, appropriate sense of style.
how'd you find her?
E. s.p. No, I had Cho look up her address.
why did you steal Abby's credit card?
I didn't. She loaned it to me.
she was a good friend.
I have friends, Daniella.
I don't loan them my credit card.
well, what can I say? Abby is generous.
I have a job interview in a few days.
she said I needed to look my best.
she always helped me when I needed it.
even if I said no, she wouldn't listen.
it's true.
ask around. She did it for lots of people.
when did she give you the card?
um... Three days ago.
the day before she went missing?
Abby called me and told me her grandma was really sick and that she wasn't gonna last much longer.
I went over to be with her.
how'd she seem?
she was sad.
crying a lot.
she and her grandma were really close.
and she was drinking.
it was-it was just wine, but still.
I told her I didn't think it was a good idea.
you know, she had problems with that kind of stuff.
was Austin there?
no. Abby wouldn't have been drinking if he was.
Austin's totally straight-edged.
he got her sober.
the night Abby went missing, where were you?
in l. a. For work.
boss, need you out here.
I said Mr. Jane. I want to talk to Mr Jane. - Where is he?
I turned my back for a second. You know how he is.
he's not here right now, Sophie. What's the problem?
I, um, I got this message.
I don't know what it means.
what message? What are you talking about?
tell your bitch mom that's what she gets for messing with Raymond Tubbs.
your sister and her friend were just the beginning.
you will reap the whirlwind.
I've never heard that voice before.
"Eight, eight"? What does that mean?
it's a code used by white supremacists.
the eighth letter of the alphabet."h," "h" - Heil hitler.
it's blocked. Sophie, we're gonna need your phone for a little while.
get a trace on it. - Yeah, you got it.
you said Abby did this.
you said her fingerprint was on the knife.
we don't know what this means, but right now you shouldn't be alone.
I'm gonna have an agent bring you home.
what about Abby? Did these people do something to her?
that's what we're gonna find out. Come with me.
okay.
Raymond Tubbs? -Yeah. Who are you?
I'm agent Cho from the cbi.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Pauline Fitzwilliam.
what about her?
a man was killed on the Fitzwilliam compound.
a family member is missing.
another family member received a voice mail.
it said,"that's what you get for messing with Raymond Tubbs."
leadership's a bitch, huh?
you try to keep your folks on point, and then some darn fool opens his mouth.
where you hail from, agent Cho?
oakland.
okay. Where are your parents from?
korea. - Koreans.
good people. Know who they are.
a lot of people today don't know who the heck they are.
a man without knowledge his roots is like a cabbage in this society.
that's true.
so you deny any connection to the incidents at the Fitzwilliam compound?
heck, no. There's an aryan soldier who honors and respects me inside the compound.
he carried out the mission for me.
I'm just saying I wouldn't call anyone about it.
that's just dumb.
but I guess there's a dummy in any group, right, agent Cho?
Mr. Jane, may I ask - Marcus, if I wanted to break into this compound, where would be the best place to do it?
excuse me?
Where's the weak link?
this property is 100% secure.
when you learned someone had been murdered in the guesthouse, something popped into your mind - An image of a location you've been worried about, a weakness.
what was it?
no. - yes.
it's nothing, but, uh... - Go on.
north wall property bends around a gully.
curve in the wall makes it hard for the sensors to pick up movement.
okay.
you'll need to go through the gate.
okay. Of course.
this aryan soldier - Give me a name.
yeah No. Why would I do that?
you've had your revenge already.
why not give up your man?
life could be a lot easier for you in here if we tell the warden you're helping us out.
extra smokes, more yard time? - Yeah. Like that.
flat screen tv maybe.
you don't understand.
there's honor among us race warriors.
loyalty.
brotherhood.
Yeah, right.
what do you mean,"yeah, right"?
it means you're wasting my time. You have no one inside the compound.
there are no aryan warriors out there awaiting your orders.
you're a sad little man alone in a box, living on delusions of grandeur.
you are 100% wrong.
I got an army behind me. An army! And I got a guy inside.
no, you don't. - Hey, wait a minute!
Howard Dressler is his name - My guy.
inside.
so choke on that, Cho.
Thanks. Heil hitler.
blood pressure's still high.
so's your heart rate.
I'm gonna give you a xanax to help calm you down.
I don't want any medication. Not today.
any word on Abby?
no.
eh if you'll excuse me, my mother's funeral is this afternoon, and I really need to finish her eulogy.
I'll come back later. - Thank you, Ed.
so you're holding the service here?
Yes. She's being buried on the property beside my father.
surprising you're going ahead with it, given recent events.
what would you have me do, Mr. Jane?
I'm sorry if I'm not behaving the way you think I should.
it's not every day my mother dies and my daughter goes missing.
now if there's... Anything else you need...
no. - Good.
because I really must finish this.
by all means.
that's a beautiful rug.
thank you. - It's very nice.
held up well, especially having kids in the house.
that's because I never let the girls play on it.
you said that, but Abby didn't listen to you, did she?
no.
whatever she was told not to do, that's exactly what she would do.
always contrary.
hard for someone like you to handle, I imagine.
someone like me?
disciplined. Rigorous.
wound.
you are wound.
it wasn't all bad.
she's a beautiful girl.
she's strong and funny...
and we'd grown apart these past few years because...
well, ever since my husband died, but even so, there were times when Abby and I were together, and it was as if she were a girl again, and... We were happy.
she's dead, isn't she?
my daughter's dead.
it's not unlikely.
excuse me.
what's this?
visitor logs from the security team - Every person who entered and left the compound over the last three months.
lisbon wants us to look through 'em.
Raymond Tubbs said he had a man named Howard Dressler inside the compound.
is that new?
Yes.
it's a gift?
from O'laughlin, huh?
he has good taste.
Thanks.
what was that name again?
uh, Howard Dressler.
got him.
nice.
what's up? - We found Howard Dressler.
he tried to run, but we caught him. We're gonna take him in now for questioning.
nice work. I'll call you back.
what's going on?
perimeter sensor's been tripped. Someone's trying to break onto the compound.
got it.
CBI! Don't move!
turn around slowly with your hands up.
Hey, Lisbon.
when did you get here?
good morning.
how are you guys doing today?
I, myself... Am having a great day.
I got a call from a Pauline Fitzwilliam, a court judge...
Fitzwilliam, saying that a cbi consultant was caught stealing a rug from her residence.
ma'am, I sincerely apologize - Oh, hush, Lisbon. There's no reason to apologize.
I was working the case.
the rug was a stand-in corpse. I just wanted to see if it was possible for the killer to leave the compound with Abby's body.
and is it possible?
not unless the culprit was a mountain gorilla.
so now you've had your fun, to no useful end, and now she's asking me to remove you from the case.
is there any reason why I shouldn't do as she asks?
she's a suspect.
Really?
she hasn't been excluded, has she? Then she's still a suspect, and it would look bad to be seen allowing a murder suspect dictate the terms of an investigation, right?
is this true, Lisbon?
is she a suspect?
she has not been excluded.
okay.
I'll give you some more rope.
don't hang yourself with it.
and, you know, next time call me when you want to do some more foolishness.
foolishness, I think, is a little harsh. I would - go.
okay, I'm leaving.
I have your numbers.
come on, Howard. Don't lie to me.
already spoke to Raymond Tubbs.
what about him?
well, you tell me.
he's an american patriot.
I subscribe to some of his newsletters. There's no crime in that.
well, Tubbs says you're his guy inside the Fitzwilliam compound.
says that you're the, uh...
"Aryan warrior that avenged his unjust imprisonment," killed Austin Marr.
I had nothing to do with that.
okay. If you say so.
but you can see how it looks. Not good.
no, no, no. I keep my business and my politics totally separate.
Oh, the third reich pool cleaning company doesn't play so good, huh?
I've exchanged a few e-mails with Tubbs. That's all.
if he says any different, he's lying.
I got immunity for what I say in here, right?
no.
okay. Occasionally... I got stuff for Abby.
stuff?
you sold her drugs?
a little coke. Some meth.
when was the last time you scored for her?
not for a couple of months, but then the other day she hit me up.
she was in a real bad way.
she asked me for an eight ball and some downers.
it took me a few days, but I got 'em.
but the morning I showed up, there was cops everywhere.
I didn't even get to give 'em to her.
look, I know I screwed up, but I didn't kill Austin.
there was a useful end, by the way.
we now know for sure that nobody entered or left the property the night of the murder, so she must've been murdered in the guest room along with Austin.
then the killer hid her body.
we searched. She's not on the compound.
you searched for a living, breathing woman and not a dead body.
big difference.
why would the killer hide one victim and leave the other one behind?
good question.
we'll search the property again. This time we'll get cadaver dogs and more personnel.
no need. I know exactly where the body is hidden.
wait. Wait. What are you gonna do?
just talk. - But they're in the middle of the funeral.
you can't just walk in there willy-nilly.
Yeah. That's right. - Thank you.
I forgot to call Hightower.
Hightower? Why?
voice mail.
Hey, Hightower. It's jane.
just wanted to let you know that, uh, there's gonna be what you like to call "foolishness" going on at Ethel sebring's funeral.
that's it. Have a great day.
she told me to call.
better hurry. - Jane. Jane.
God, our father, your power brings us to birth.
your providence guides our lives, and by your command, we return to dust.
unite us together in one family to sing your praise forever and ever.
Amen.
in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit, amen.
Amen. Thank you, father.
uh, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Patrick Jane.
for those of you who don't know me, I am a consultant with the cbi.
I know that you're all here today to mourn the loss of Ethel sebring, but I have a very important announcement that simply can't wait.
what is the meaning of this?
uh, just bear with me, please, for one moment.
well, there's no easy way to say this, so I'm just gonna come straight out with it.
Abby Fitzwilliam is dead.
no.
Yeah, it's true, Sophie.
I'm - I'm very sorry for your loss.
how?
we don't know all the details as yet, but we will know very soon.
where is she?
she's hidden in your grandmother's casket.
what?
it's quite clever, actually.
it's-it's one place you wouldn't look for a body, other than the obvious exception, of course.
are you playing some sort of demented joke?
I wish I could say I was.
uh... They were both small women.
they could fit comfortably together in this box.
the only way we can tell for sure is if we, uh...
well, we're gonna have to take a quick peek.
um, we-we will do it inside.
uh, Dr. Saban will oversee proceedings to make sure that everything is shipshape.
agent, have you no control over this buffoon?
Lisbon, trust me. You gotta trust me on this one.
Mr. Jane is making a valid point.
ma'am, you know more about the law than we do.
we can get a warrant, but I think this will be quicker and less intrusive, with all due respect.
this is wrong.
Oh, please. - Ethel was dignified in life.
she'd want to remain so in death.
doctor, you of all people, should know there's nothing dignified about death.
what's going on?
you got my message?
ma'am, everything is under control.
what's he doing to that casket? - Well, that's what I was calling you about.
opening it? Jane says that Abby Fitzwilliam's body is in the casket.
Oh, my god.
have you gone completely insane?
no, I don't think so.
there we go.
Pauline, are you sure you wanna do this?
just get it over with.
what?
Oh, no.
the guests have been sent home. The funeral's been postponed. I hope you're happy.
Oh, it doesn't make sense.
Abby's body is not in this coffin.
you promised me.
Yeah, I thought she was. I was certain that she was in there.
well, you were wrong.
well, it doesn't make sense that I was wrong.
stop saying that.
but this is the perfect place to hide the body.
it's the one place that no one would think to look.
Jane, that's enough.
no, w-she's on this compound. I know that.
I know that she's on this compound. - Jane.
we need to get the sniffer dogs and the helicopters and - 'Cause she is here.
I am so sorry. Sorry.
okay. All right.
um... At first light tomorrow, I want you to start a comprehensive search for Abby's body.
if she's here, find her.
she's here.
Lisbon, what were you thinking?
it was - No excuses, ma'am.
he asked me to trust him, and I did.
your job is not to trust him.
your job is to trust your judgment, not his.
that poor woman was in the ground.
not in the ground, but on her way.
I mean, aren't we all on our way?
you have messed with the funeral of a high court judge's mother on the very day she finds out that her daughter is most likely dead.
that is a very bad career move for all of us.
sorry if I got you guys into trouble.
I made a mistake.
Oh, I'm sorry. Say that again.
I made a mistake. I said it twice. I won't say it again.
because it just now occurs to me that perhaps I'll be proven not quite as wrong as I appear to be in this very moment.
is that right? - Yes. In fact, I'm sure of it. So don't worry.
your careers are safe.
judge Fitzwilliam will change her tune once I reveal her daughter's killer.
won't she?
I imagine she will. When do you plan on doing that?
this very evening. - This very night?
but you have to trust me.
right. And what if you're wrong again?
well, if I'm wrong, then we're in deep trouble.
but what are the chances, really, of me being wrong twice in a row?
think about that one.
of course, if either of you have a better idea how to find Abby's body and catch her killer, please, these are not taxi doors. They're ears.
it's not gonna work unless you're quiet.
I can't keep quiet.
my legs are asleep.
what do you mean, your legs are asle?
legs don't sleep.
it's absurd. I don't know why people say that.
Oh, damn.
damn. Where the hell is it?
Hello?
Hey, doc. - Put your hands in the air!
sorry. Did we scare you?
you hid Abby's body, and not Austin's, because you had to.
evidence of your guilt was inside Abby.
come on. We both know the autopsy will confirm it.
you were giving Abby drugs.
a few days before Ethel died, Abby relapsed.
she was an addict.
she was either gonna get her drugs from me or from the street.
I was managing her addiction.
it's recognized therapeutic practice.
for which you were paid.
well, yes, of course. I'm a doctor.
of course.
so you weren't doing it to help Abby out.
you were doing it for the money.
with Ethel dying, you needed a new source of income. Then along came Abby, a rich, young addict.
Abby. Abby, it's okay. You're okay. You're okay.
Abby. Abby, stay with me.
she o. d.'ed so fast.
I couldn't save her.
Austin came back.
what's going on? - Saw what had happened.
What-what'd you do to her?
he was gonna go to the police, turn me in.
my whole life was over if he made that call.
I picked up the knife, just to stop him, not to hurt him.
I wasn't thinking.
I figured if I made it look like Abby did it... People would believe it.
I knew if they found Abby's body, they'd find the drugs in her system, so I hid her in my room, in the closet.
I was so scared when the police came to search the house.
I was sure they'd find her.
you took advantage of Abby.
she trusted you, and you preyed on her in her weakest moment.
she never had a chance.
so I just talked to judge Fitzwilliam.
And?
and she says that if you will apologize for the cavalier manner with which you disrupted her mother's burial, she will not pursue disciplinary action against you or Lisbon or myself.
tell her jane says she's a self-righteous, embittered old bat, and she should thank me.
Oh, god, Jane, please.
you're right, Mr. Jane.
I came here for an apology, but I realize now I was wrong to stand on dignity.
I am embittered.
and your arrogant, callous, juvenile behavior did reveal the truth after all, so...
thank you. Thank you very much.
good evening to you.
good evening.
sorry.
okay, then.
everyone's happy.
three bounces into this cup.
three bounces.
he can do it.
won't happen.
You-kiss good-bye to your cash.
nice.
never any doubt.
just a little skill I picked up working the night shift at San Diego. Thank you.
you wanna go again?
Nope.
Oh, do I hear chicken?
van pelt. Line two-O'laughlin.
Thanks.
go ahead. - What?
you always say something when O'laughlin calls.
there's nothing to say. I'm over it.
who are you and what have you done with Wayne Rigsby?
anybody see Jane?
where are you?
I'm boosting team morale.
people are bored. That needs to be addressed.
uh, people are bored because nobody's been killed that needs our help.
it's a good thing when homicide detectives are bored.
so why are you calling me to find out where I am?
because I get nervous when I don't know where you are.
what do you mean,"boosting morale"?
I'm buying fresh fruit - Clears away the cobwebs, chases away the blues.
Oh, good. Get me a red delicious.
okay.
Norberto! de est las rojas deliciosas?
let's go. We're going. Come on!
okay. Okay.
golden delicious is fine if they don't have
Lisbon! I'm in trouble.
how long ago did you get the call?
35 minutes.
witnesses?
9-1-1 had some callers. C.h. p.'s rounding 'em up for us now.
Jane?
no sign.
half a dozen 9-millimeter casings-3 went into the victim.
got 2380 casings here.
looks like one hit.
the guy runs a fruit stand. What's he doing with a 380?
he's probably been help up more than once.
not this time. Cashegister's full.
there's a blood trail starting here, heading out into that direction.
looks like whoever the grocer shot went over to the barn after he took the bullet, kicked in the door.
Jane was there. So they were a him.
boss, c.h. p. Rounded up the 9-1-1 callers.
this is harold keel. He made the first call.
did you see the shooting, Mr. Keel?
no, just saw two guys in a lot.
one of 'em had a gun.
he was trying to shove the other guy into the trunk of his car.
can you describe him?
the guy with the gun had a sweatshirt with the hood up.
and the other guy was smaller, in a suit - Nononoreally a suit, but like a vest.
your name?
I'm Sherry Winger. I heard the shots.
but you didn't see anything?
I just heard them while driving by, but about a minute later, a car booked past me going about 100.
took the exit ramp on the highway going north.
what did the car look like?
sedan, brownish-yellow.
you get a look at the license plates?
I think it was blue and purple.
that's an arizona plate. I'm on it.
sergeant? - Yeah.
we need a roadblock set up 100 miles north, looking for that car, also an aircraft checking out the side roads.
have one of your men stay with both the witnesses and run their licenses.
make sure they're clean. - You got it.
we need the fbi on this.
I'll make the call.
if Jane were here, he-he'd make some snarky remark about something we missed at the crime scene.
so? What is it?
hands out.
looks pretty painful.
shut up.
I could help make that hurt less.
right.
Hey, what is this about? Why-why am I here?
C. h.p.'s got nothing on the roadblocks yet.
keep checking. Don't wait for them to report in.
the phone company's sending over Jane's records. Run his calls.
we need to know who he was talking to... And what he was talking about.
it feels weird to go through Jane's phone. He'd hate it.
he'll hate it a lot more if we don't find him.
Teresa. - I can't talk press right now, Brenda.
it's about Jane. - What?
I'm hearing from reporters.
the highway shutdown's getting attention.
there are rumorshat a cbi employee has been killed.
for god sakes.
just give me something I can give 'em to shut 'em up.
we don't know anything yet, Brenda. Don't say anything.
that just makes it worse.
it's an ongoing investigation. No comment.
Hey, Lisbon. You remember agent O'laughlin.
you're the liaison on this?
any assistance the fbi can offer, you let me know.
U think this was red John?
I don't see any signs of it. Red John is clean and efficient. This was sloppy.
all right, well, it could be deliberate, keep you off his trail.
red John already took Jane once and let him go.
why would he take him again?
he's a psycho. Who knows why he does what he does?
Yeah, well, he takes him a second time, I n't think he's coming back, so let's just assume that it's not him until we hear something otherwise.
Rigsby, where are we with the license plate?
got a list of cars with arizona plates that have been stopped and ticketed in the state.
getting the names now.
Cho, ballistics? - Dead end.
no matches from the shell casings we found at the scene.
help Rigsby run the Arizona names. - Already am.
Teresa, I need a statement.
you already have my statement, Brenda.
what's this about?
if we don't say something about Jane, there's gonna be rumors and lies out there until we do.
that's fine with me. - Not with me.
does Jane have money?
uh, just enough to use. He doesn't really care about money.
okay, so this probably isn't a kidnapping for ransom, which means whoever did this is motivated by something personal - anger, revenge.
Yeah.
so it would probably be a good idea to get Jane's name and picture out in the media.
right. Humanize him.
let them know we're looking for him.
we shouldn't make a statement until we know something.
I'm sorry, but that is not your call.
okay, Brenda.
CBI consultant patrick Jane has been taken by person or persons unknown.
we're investigating and conducting a search- An extensive search- In the area. Okay?
that'll work.
are you working this?
Yeah. Sorry, I didn't get a chance to call.
it's okay. I'll find you later. - Right.
we didn't need to share this with the public.
Yes, we did.
and, Teresa, not saying something doesn't mean that something isn't happening.
I know.
so, can you get me a rundown on his enemies?
you mean, the bad guys?
or cops, lawyers... - What, he mesd d th cops that badly?
Oh, yes, but I don't think a cop would come after a citizen over Jane.
all right. So what about his personal life - Family, friends, lovers?
he's a loner. We're his family, pretty much.
Yeah. I went through Jane's calls for the past three weeks.
they're all case-related. Nothing else.
look further back. - Okay.
didn't one of Jane's old psychic clients come after him?
Yeah, we're going through his client list, but why come after him now?
I mean, it's been so long since he was in that game.
right.
which leads us to the inevitable conclusion.
I think someone Jane put away is getting back at him.
maybe they've been released.
maybe they're reaching out from prison.
whichever it is, we need to go through every case Jane's worked on since he came to the cbi.
van pelt, start digging.
whoever did this has probably been unhappy a long time.
everything okay?
you said... You can make it hurt less.
sure. I can do that.
What'd you mean by that?
pain's in the mind, and that's my specialty.
you got some kind of pill on you?
no. No. Just relax. Look at me.
let my voice take the place of the pain.
feel the pain getting smaller.
feel the pain going away.
it's folding in on itself.
folding... And you're feeling relaxed... And calm.
Hello, patrick.
do you remember me?
maybe.
that means you don't.
no, it just means that I have difficulty talking when someone is pointing a gun at me.
Why?
does it make you scared?
Yes, it does.
I don't like being bullied. Please put the gun down.
I like the look on your face right now too much.
then just take a photograph.
please put the gun down.
I - If y uerere nna kill me, then you would've killed me already.
whatever you want from me, you're not gonna get it unless you put the gun down.
thank you.
you don't remember me, do you?
is that strange?
given the way you're carrying yourself, I'd be surprised if your own mother recognized you.
well, my mother died when I was born, so you're probably right.
sorry. Bad choice.
little harsh on your colleague there.
who cares about him?
I can't believe this.
you're here.
I mean, you're really - You're really here.
Yeah. I'm-I'm here.
so what's the plan, Rachel?
so you do know who I am.
how many motherless 23-year-olds with a slight pigeon-toed stance and a hint of a new england childhood in their voice do you think I've met?
it was a trick then - The comment about my mother.
you are a sly one, Mr. Jane.
this is about your father, isn't it?
we're not going to talk about this.
we can talk about whatever you want to talk about.
no. We're not going to talk, period. - Okay.
I know what you do when you talk to people - That gentle hand on their shoulder the long look in their eyes. You're not doing that toe.
n't kw what you're talking about.
you think I'm stupid. - No, I don't.
you think everybody's stupid except for you.
you're wrong. - No. No.
you don't even know what's going on here.
I am going to kill you.
but I am going to hurt you first.
I have to take my medication now.
and everyone at cbi is hoping and working for the safe return of our friend and colleague.
we also want to extend our condolences to the family of Norberto Rivera, who died trying to help mr. Jane.
the cbi is offering a $10, 000 reward for anyone providing information leading to the return of Mr. Jane.
we are going to put up a phone number.
we encourage anyone with relevant information to call.
thank you.
these are Jane's cases.
we need a disposition on each case.
is the suspect in jail? If not, where are they?
then look for anything that sticks out. - Okay.
more cases? - Complaints.
I went down to the outreach officer in community relations and asked if they had a file on Jane.
looks like there's more than one.
he has his own filing cabinet.
have bob in admin have his juniors help you do a preliminary search. I'll clear it with Hightower.
I got something.
C. h.p Got a call from a rancher outside wilton.
says one of his workers saw a gray car on a private road that runs through his land a few hours ago.
a farmhand approached the car. Driver waved a gun at him.
Wilton? That's south of where Jane was taken.
the witness said he was going north.
I'll get Wilton p. d. to check it out. - You go.
O'laughlin, you mind going with him?
we've already had one person taken today.
until we know wpwh's going on, I don't want anyone going anywhere alone.
sure. Let's go.
thanks for coming along.
no problem.
he says it's about Jane.
who's Linus Wagner?
he's this creepy doctor that Jane put away a couple years ago.
he-he killed two people and tried to make it look like red John d itit.
this is Lisbon.
agent. Dr. Linus Wagner. How are you?
what's this about?
I happened to see on the tv in our recreation area the announcement about Patrick Jane.
very sorry to hear it. I hope he's all right.
Yeah, I'm sure.
do you have information about him?
Yes. Yes, I think I may.
why don't you come out here, and we can talk about it?
just tell me.
no. You should come.
it's complicated.
Mr. Mendoza?
yeah?
Wayne Rigsby, cbi.
you called c. h.p. About the car?
that's right.
you could've mentioned it was on fire.
W - well, it wasn't.
not-not then.
one of my hands saw a car on our road with a guy holding a gun, so I called the cops.
a little later I saw smoke, so I called the fire department.
you could've given us a heads-up.
Why? You guys put out fires?
your guy get a look at the driver?
can he give us a description?
no. Uh, he said he was wearing a sweatshirt with, uh, with the hood up.
Thanks.
I have nothing. You?
Nope.
we got California plates.
second thing the witness got wrong.
typical.
look, they must've brought Jjane here and switched to another car.
Yep. It's stolen.
forensics can sift the ashes. We should get back to the office.
what people don't realize is when they torch a car, the gas tank goes first.
RNG bu s back to front.
so the trunk gets incinerated, but sometimes... Sometimes stuff up front survives.
well, the car's stolen. Paperwork's useless.
the guy who took Jane - He got shot, right?
so he's driving, and he's bleeding.
he's looking for something to put on the wound.
what do people do when they're driving and they're looking for something in the glove compartment?
this... We take to forensics.
a fingerprint.
no need.
hold it up.
Why?
bureau techs can scan the image into a. f.i. s.
if he's in the system, we'll have an i. d. In ten minutes.
nice catch yeah. Thanks.
the print Rigsby found matches a guy named fred kittel, a thug out of yuba city.
arrests for assault, armed robbery, and attempted murder.
Where's theJane connection? - Can't see one.
he wasn't involved in any of Jane's cases, and he's never been questioned by the cbi.
so very likely he's a hired hand.
somebody checking his residence?
yuba city p. d.Went. Say it's empty, stripped. They're circulating his picture.
okay. Check his family, running buddies, cellmates, employers.
gotta be a connection.
thank you.
thank you for making the trip, agent.
why am I here, Wagner?
I do hope we can be cordial.
what's the information?
I've been in contact with the person behind Jane's disappearance.
who's that?
first things first.
what do you want?
I don't know if you've kept up with my trial.
it was long and... Tedious.
unfortunately, it concluded with my conviction on two counts of first-degree murder, - so the death penalty is an option. - That sounds about right.
the judge might be convinced to choose something... Lesser.
life in prison, say.
preferable, from my point of view, but I need people to testify on my behalf, to ask for clemency, and who better than a cbi agent?
clemency?
on what possible grounds?
for compassion's sake and... And...
humanity, more than any particular personal worth I might have.
although I did do a great deal of good in my time, as you know.
there are villages in Africa - You killed and mutilated two people.
I'm aware of that.
if you help us with Jane, we can help make your life easier in here.
agent, I'm about to be put on death row.
do you really think I care about extra soap and cheeseburgers?
your friend Jane is very clever, but I don't think he realizes the rageful feelings his trickery can provoke.
I've felt that rage.
I've thought of various unpleasant things I would do to him, and right now someone is acting on thoughts like those.
aren't you worried what's being done to him?
there are things so much worse than killing a man.
you can go to hell.
and when they kill you, I'm gonna be there to watch.
come on.
I will tell them that you helped on a case and ask for clemency, but only if your information brings Jane back alive.
I don't control that.
I don't care.
I've done a lot of writing in here.
the bountiful free time.
a while back, I published an article in an online journal about emotional trauma and its effect on the psyche.
it included some observations on Jane.
not long after, I got a letter from a young woman who claimed to be a graduate student in psychology.
she said she was researching Jane, but she didn't know a lick about psychology.
she was, however, obsessed with Jane...
and exceedingly hostile toward him.
what's her name?
you, uh... You planning on doing anything about him?
no.
that's not very hygienic.
you know, maybe you can just shove him in the corner before he starts to smell.
I mean, I'd do it myself, but...
no. - Fine.
that smell gets in your drapes, you're never getting it out.
you think everything's funny.
just the funny things.
you never feel guilty, do you?
I feel guilty every minute of every d.
see? You did it.
you got me talking again, trying to mess with my mind.
it's abusive, what you do.
you use people... Like toys.
no thought for the damage you do, th hurt.
I'm sorry about your father.
maybe you think you are. - I am.
no, you're not yet.
you will be.
you ever see a rancher use a cattle prod?
no. No, Rachel. - Cattle can be stubborn.
takes a real jolt to get them going.
it must hurt.
you'll have to let me know.
no.
so wagner says Sherry Winger was after Jane - The girl who was the witness?
I thought c. h.p. Checked her out.
now they're saying the license and registration are fakes - Top dollar forgeries.
they never would've caught it if they hadn't taken a second look.
so do we have any idea who Sherry Winger really is or where she is?
no. No. The only thing we know for sure is that she hated Jane.
linus gave me copies of the letters she wrote to him.
I gave the originals to forensics so they could run the paper.
why would she show up at the scene?
it seems like the last place she'd want to be.
misdirection. She gives us the wrong license plate - We head north instead of going south.
boss, I've read something else written by this person.
you sure? - Yeah, there are phrases that I've seen before.
this one calls Jane a coyote-like trickster, and in one of these...
here.
in this one.
calls Jane a trickster, a coyote.
who wrote that letter?
it's from the daughter of Don Bowman.
get a copy of Sherry Winger's license.
who's Don Bowman?
case from three years ago.
insurance company executive.
he was writing fake policies and cashing them in.
company auditor found out, so Bowman killed him.
that's Bowman. - And Jane put him away?
he had a daughter - rachel, 19.
he was a single father.
she idolized him. He adored her.
okay. - Jane forges a letter to Bowman under Rachel's name, claiming she's discovered proof that he committed the murder.
she's devastated, doesn't know whether to go to the police or kill herself.
so Bowman races to his daughter.
he's so sorry. He did it all for her.
she needs to keep the secret.
and you're there? Jane has you there?
we got the whole conversation on tape.
just checked the records. Don Bowman and Fred Kittel were both imprisoned at corcoran at the same time.
that's the connection.
but Bowman couldn't be behind this. - Why not? He's dead.
died in prison about a year ago.
Bowman's dead, but his daughter isn't. Is that the driver's license picture?
look at this.
let me see that.
Ooh, miss Rachel's had some work done, but that's her.
get her address fast. - Okay.
you didn't know that my father died in prison, did you?
no.
of an infection.
do you know how incredibly stupid that is?
simple antibiotics could've saved him... But a prison hospital- It's-it's a nightmare in there.
they just let him die, but you killed him.
you know, your anger is misplaced.
Oh, really?
you can't be angry with your father, so... Here I am.
don't you dare say that.
my father loved me.
he took care of me, provided for me. I'm all he ever cared about.
Yes, you are, and he wouldn't want you doing this.
Oh, I think he would be very proud.
he loved me so much, and you made me betray him.
when you were talking to me, asking about me and my dad...
I thought that you were actually concerned.
I mean, I thought that you liked me.
you want me to be sorry?
okay. I am sorry.
I'm sorry that the loss of your father drove you mad, but I don't regret what I did to him.
he was a thief and a murderer, and I did everything I could to catch him, because that's just who I am.
you set?
yeah go!
clear! Clear!
kitchen clear!
second story clear!
house is empty! There's dust everywhere!
it looks like she's been gone for weeks!
basement? - Nothin'!
all right, let's get forensics in here!
look for anything that'll tell us where she went!
and get somebody to turn off that damn alarm!
there's somebody in my house.
I gotta go.
I'll be back.
Rachel, can you please move that thing?
please. Please. Please, the stench is unbearable.
o - over there, anywhere. Just please, please move him.
thank you.
smell at.
sorry, pal.
so we got a line on Fred Kittel's dad.
he's got a place just south of diamond springs.
you and O'laughlin go and talk to him. - Sure.
I'm gonna head back to the office.
I wanna look at something in Rachel bowman's file.
all right, I'll hold down the fort here.
Jane, where are you?
not Jane, agent.
just so you know, I'm looking right at you.
everything will be all right if you do exactly as I say.
if not, Jane will be dead in 15 minutes.
clear? - Clear.
drive another 100 yards and stop at the cafe.
take your gun out of its holster.
place it on the seat.
get out of your car and close the door.
walk away.
15 minutes, agent.
now walk down the street and come to the gas station.
let's go see Patrick.
I want two choppers in the air and a 40-block perimeter secured around this site.
no car leaves this area without being searched!
not one!
we have no i. d. On any vehicle.
the suspect is female, early 20s, blonde, about 5'7."
she has at least one hostage and possibly two with her.
give me a second, okay?
grace, the office said something happened to Lisbon.
she's gone. We think rachel took her about 20 minutes ago.
she got lisbon.
when? - Just now.
should we come back?
Hey, boss, do you want Rigsby and O'laughlin back?
no. Tell them to finish what they're doing.
Hightower says no.
Wayne... - I know.
I know, Grace. It's... It's gonna be okay.
all right. Bye.
Mr. Kittel! This is the police!
come out with your hands up!
Mr. Kittel? Cbi! Hello?!
Mr. Kittel, put the gun down!
no way I ain't. - Put it down now.
hell, no!
you got no right to be here.
we just wanna talk.
fine! Talk yourselves on outta here!
go on! Get out.
go on!
all right.
this is how it's gonna go.
on the count of three, I'm gonna shoot you in the head.
Rigsby - No, it's my deal!
put the gun down, or on three, I shoot you in the head.
you ready?
one... - Take it easy, okay?
two... Three!
okay! Okay.
why you have to be such a hard-ass for?
I ain't seen Freddy in six months.
I couldn't tell ya anything about that son of a bitch.
do you know what he was doing, who he was in contact with?
what he was doin'?
well, the last time I saw him, what he was doing was smokin' weed and lookin' at porn on my laptop.
you have any idea how we can get in touch with any of his friends?
no, thank god.
night crawlers - All of 'em.
there is one good thing, though, that he did for me recently.
he pissed off my ex - His mother.
how'd he do that?
she don't talk to him for months.
he shows up, sweet-talks her into giving him the keys to the family's hunting cabin.
and then he splits with all the xanax.
Oh, I'll tell ya.
I had a laugh.
where is this cabin exactly, Mr. Kittel?
go.
I'm going. I'm going.
visiting hours.
Hey, Lisbon.
hands.
what's the plan, Rrachel?
I get to watch Lisbon die just like you watched your father die?
that's right. - What?!
that's what I thought.
I've been smelling gasoline. You burning the place down?
that's right. - Rachel, think about this for a minute.
Oh, I have. - Oh, she certainly has.
you're never gonna get away with it.
you'll never know if I do or don't.
Lisbon, I'm sorry.
this is my fault.
I will not let you burn alive as god is my witness.
good-bye.
Rachel. Rachel, wait! Rachel!
you're wasting your energy.
you have a better idea?
just so happens I do.
Where'd you get that?
him.
I was hoping to unpick my handcuffs, but, uh, no luck.
well, what are you gonna do?
you're not gonna like it.
help!
help! Help!
what did you do?
I said I wouldn't let her burn.
this way she won't suffer.
son of a bitch!
you think I won't hurt you more?
No! - I can do this all night!
get the gun! Get it! Get the gun!
to hell with this.
you all right?
uh... I think I need a shower.
I'm heading out, and, uh, just wanted to say... It was a good day.
Yeah.
I'm gonna kill you on the count of three" was a little out of the box.
well, it worked.
Yeah, it-it did.
look... What I really wanted to say is, uh... I hope we're cool.
Yeah, cause you did some outstanding work.
Yeah. Yeah, we are.
appreciate that. - Okay.
see you around.
o'laughlin. - Yeah.
don't hurt her.
or wt?
or you'll have to deal with me.
you okay? - Good. Thank you.
you're looking a little creaky.
Yeah.
well, a cattle prod will do it to you.
well, that doctor should try it himself sometime.
well, that was a big smile.
of course I'm glad you're back, but I'm also glad we finally solved one without you.
you were kidnapped and delivered to me.
that counts as solving one?
Hightower and the team found us.
but if I hadn't held off Rachel, they would have found us dead in a burned out house.
Oh, you held off rachel.
Where's my apple?
your what? - My apple. I asked you to get me an apple.
I come through the valley of death, and all you can think about is your stomach-a piece of fruit.
that's right. - An apple.
Yes. - Well, that's just plain selfish.
selfish? - Yes, it is.
now I - Me, selfish?
you're on my couch.
I'm trying to have a cup of tea.
have you finished?
you call me creaky.
I've been cattle-prodded all week.
I just wanna have a rest and a cup of tea and a little sleep.
wish I had a cattle prod.
old town we don't know if he jumped or somebody pushed him, but he had to fall from one of the apartments above us.
any witnesses? - No.
they saw him hit, but the crowd sure gathered fast once he did.
including the attorney general's niece.
she hasn't stopped sobbing since.
let's process this scene quickly, get the body out of here.
you, uh, get an i. D. On it yet?
no. But I tell you what, that is one fine santa suit.
plush pile. Real leather uppers.
I wish mine was that nice.
the beard appears to be real.
Hey, Jane? Could I trouble you for a professional opinion?
no. - no what?
this isn't the actual santa claus. - Oh, really?
some say he doesn't exist, period
that he's a 19th-century marketing gimmick.
I venture no opinion on that, but this definitely isn't him.
this is an impostor.
and how can you tell?
Santa would smell like reindeer and chimneys.
this man smells like cheap whiskey.
uh, excuse me. Could you, uh, reach inside that outside pocket there?
Yeah, just there near the candy canes. What is that?
Christmas card.
my life is a lie. Forgive me.
well, it's not a traditional christmas greeting, but it has punch and concision.
very, uh, thoughtful of him to put it in a plastic baggie for us.
lets us out. It's a straight-up suicide.
possibly.
but you don't think so.
here is a man that spends his time making kids happy
putting a little magic in their life, giving them hope. - Yeah?
would a man like that end his life making such a bloody spectacle of himself?
in character, in a public place where children are bound to see him and spoil their christmases forever?
I doubt it. This was murder.
okay, you may have a point, but, you know, let's keep an open mind on this
murder.
happy holidays.
benjamin Ripple has been a tenant here for years.
he'd never kill himself.
he enjoyed his life too much, and his art.
his art? - The art of being santa.
benjamin lived by the traditions of st. Nick year-round.
uh, we'll take it from here. Thanks.
thank you. Well...
now this was a man who knew how to sustain a moment.
I can't believe people buy this crap.
I sense a Christmas speech coming on.
no, I just think people can celebrate a holy day without lying to children about a magical fat guy with a sack full of toys.
so you took the whole santa revelation badly, huh?
crushed my heart like a cigarette.
explains why you're still looking for magic in your life.
benjamin Ripple, on the other hand, chose to keep his childhood beliefs very much alive.
he was happiest when he was at home.
he felt protected, and not so popular at school.
I'm guessing his parents died young.
so to cope, he transformed his most cherished memories into an identity.
a successful career, based on this father christmas fantasy chalet here.
a career like this?
St. Nick's picks-- your holiday decoration superstore.
it's a mail order business.
benjamin ripple was a survivor.
highly unlikely he took his own life.
so you think the suicide was staged?
well, it's not to say he was without his secrets.
we all have secrets, don't we?
and christmas, well, it's... Full of contradictions.
the man that devoted his life to spreading joy could very likely be hiding a, uh...
what is that? - What?
a sobriety chip.
still waiting on forensics, but the coroner said that santa's blood alcohol concentration was . 45.
that's a lethal level. - So much for sobriety.
why would somebody kill the victim if he was dying of booze anyway?
that suggests suicide, not murder.
so does his bank account. I ran Ripple's financials.
his mail order business was hit hard by the recession.
it's almost bankrupt.
so his business takes a dive, Ripple starts drinking, then he takes a dive straight off his building.
guess again. I showed the suicide note to our handwriting analyst, compared it to attested samples of ripple's signature.
he didn't write the note.
and we're back to murder. What else do we know about Ripple?
uh, he's president of something called the national society of authentic santas.
what's that? - It's a fraternal group dedicated to the accurate portrayal of santa claus.
one of ripple's neighbors told me about it. They're having a convention downtown.
Rigsby, you and Van Pelt head over there, see what you can find out...
after Hightower's briefing on the Johnson killing.
what does she have to brief us for? Someone torched a cop killer.
it happened in our house. It's not right.
he was a cop killer. Good riddance.
Yeah, okay, zip it if you know what's good for you.
walk over. I'm gonna go round up Jane.
two days ago, a suspect was doused in an accelerant and set alight in a cbi holding cell.
this was not karma, rough justice, payback.
this was a criminal act.
the homicide investigation will be led by J. J. Laroche, the new head of our professional standards unit.
thank you.
who the hell is J. J. Laroche?
excuse me. - sorry.
thank you, ms. Hightower.
it's very likely that one of you people here in this room is the murderer.
you know who you are.
okay, lights, please.
we're going to run through the facts now...
so that we are all on the same page.
the victim was Todd Johnson.
E. M.T. Responsible for killing six policemen and a young woman, that we know of.
our updated security system has provided me with a very accurate list of everybody who was in this building at the time of the murder.
this guy should charge admission.
I will be talking selectively with some of you on the list over the next days, my people will be taking blood, hair, and tissue samples from everybody on the list.
your cooperation is expected and appreciated.
uh, excuse me. - Yes.
why the samples?
what's your name? - Wayne Rigsby.
Wayne... Wayne... We need the samples...
to test for accelerants.
thank you for your interest.
any other questions?
Tyger, Tyger...
you remembered something.
did I? - Yes, you did. What was it?
the smell of a man burning. Do you know that smell?
Yes. Very like barbecue.
but we both know that's not what I'm referring to.
a lighter.
I opened the door, Todd was on fire, and there was a green lighter on the bench.
but it wasn't in the evidence report.
you read the evidence report. - Oh, more like skimmed.
you know, those things are not exactly summer reading, but I get paid to consult, so skim I do.
it's on its way to the fbi crime lab.
may I? - No.
I won't be needing your consultation on this case.
but you and I will talk this afternoon.
look forward to it.
aldwych santapalooza...
for santa henry's social media workshop at 3: 00.
and, uh, don't forget to buy your raffle tickets for the jingle ball tonight.
I'm bob. Can I help you?
agent Wayne Rigsby. This is agent Van Pelt. We're from cbi.
Oh, you're here about Benjamin.
he should be up here, not me.
I mean, we're just all trying to move ahead here. It's what he'd want.
were you close with the victim?
Yes, I was. Um, we all were-- - liar!
you hated Benjamin.
you were trying to kick him out of office.
well, congratulations. You got what you wanted.
and you are?
and that man had a vendetta against Benjamin because he wanted to open our doors to santas of all races, creeds, and colors.
which will never happen.
look, if santa isn't white, male, and christian, then what the heck is he?
he's everyone.
he's the spirit of generosity in all of us. He's the
Oh, would you be quiet, you dumb hippie?
okay, let's just-- let's just go for a little drive, shall we?
everything's fine. Just... Carry on.
happy hanukkah.
Feliz navidad.
Where's Patrick Jane?
in the field.
that's inconvenient.
I'm sorry. Is there a problem?
Yes. Jane is the lead suspect in my investigation, and I can't find him.
Jane's your lead suspect?
you smile.
you think he's not capable of murder?
he's capable.
I'm smiling because it's an absurd idea Jane killing Johnson.
he caught him. He put him in that cell.
he was the last person to see him alive in that cell.
and I was next to last.
look, Johnson asked to speak with Jane.
he said he had a secret he wouldn't tell anyone else.
Jane didn't want to see him. I made him go.
the guy was on fire when he opened the cell door.
why would Jane kill him?
that's what I shall ask him...
when I find him.
Hey, Lisbon. - Uh, Laroche is looking for you.
wish him luck.
Jane, you don't want to rile this one up. You should probably come in.
uh, did you track down Ripple's alcohol recovery group?
well, I think I found what I'm looking for. Gotta go!
Hey, Virgil.
Patrick. What are you doing here?
your old assistant told me where to find you. I need your help.
well, that's a twist. You never needed my help when I was your boss.
what help could I be now?
a cop-killer burned alive in cbi custody.
I heard.
listen, if it's anything to do with that, I don't want to
whoever set the fire works for Red John.
he was a member of Red John's network.
and another member of his network killed him to stop him from talking.
but here's the thing--Red John doesn't know I know that.
for the first time, I have the advantage.
you sound nuts, my friend.
no, th-this is real.
if I can find who killed Todd Johnson, I can trace them back to Red John.
I need Laroche's suspect list, which you, with all your back-channel contacts, can get me.
what does Lisbon think of your theory?
I can't tell her. That'd put her at risk.
of course. And what about me?
you're a brave old man with nothing to lose.
not so brave. Not so old.
what do you say? Will you help me?
you need a different kind of help.
red John has turned you into a paranoid conspiracy freak.
this from a guy on a pier with 2 40s under his chair and no fish in his bucket?
you're not even using the right bait. - Am so.
what do you do when you catch one?
depends on what kind of fish it is.
no. When you catch one, no matter what kind it is, you will stop and you will look at it, at this piece of life that you destroyed, and you will think to yourself, "what the hell am I doing here, a drunken fish-killer, when I could be doing something useful?
you two should be ashamed of yourselves.
you, with the grudge, where were you last night?
having some drinks with the guys.
they were plotting ways to replace Benjamin as president.
how would you know? - Is it true?
look, I'm head of the steering committee.
benjamin was using our society as a platform to promote his online business.
and how'd you know what they were talking about last night?
I was sitting two stools away at the hotel bar.
they had no idea who I was without the beard.
Oh, gee, a spy!
a concerned member of the n. S.A. S.
they were trying to take over his position.
and they were drooling over his date.
the victim had a date at the bar? - No, at the opening night mixer.
an attractive young woman.
you called her his ho-ho-ho. - Oh, come on.
you can't tell me that Benjamin didn't pay for her with the proceeds from that online superstore that he built on our backs!
either of you happen to catch the name of this woman?
so, we were all close to Benjamin.
I was his sponsor for ten years.
but really, he helped me up.
southside
it's okay, I'm okay. Thanks.
let's just forge ahead.
are there any newcomers in their first few days of sobriety who would like a welcome chip?
um... Why not?
Oh, okay. Thank you very-- thank you. Okay.
guess I'll be a newcomer every day.
it's customary to introduce yourself. First name only.
Patrick. - Hi, Patrick.
Hi, folks.
anybody who can sponsor Patrick, please raise your hand.
would you?
sure. Sure. Um, of--of course. I'd be happy to.
thank you.
would you like to share, Patrick?
uh, no, I'm not--I'm not ready to share. Not yet, thanks.
well, nobody will think less of you if you don't, but you won't find a more supportive group than we are.
we all...
find relief in sharing our--our daily struggle with addiction.
well, to be perfectly honest, I'm not an addict.
I, um...
well, that's...
that's not strictly true. I do have an addiction.
go on. You're safe here.
it, um... Destroyed my family.
but I-I c--I can't talk about it.
I... It's not that I don't want to.
it's just, I have so many bad things in my head that I'd...
like to throw out, I just...
if I start talking about it...
I...
just don't know that I'll be able to stop.
excuse me.
anybody else wanna share?
what are you doing here? - Watching you.
you have substance abuse issues, Patrick?
there's no tag for that in your files.
I'm on a case.
you're telling me those words back there-- they weren't real?
I mean, you're sweating.
simple parlor trick.
with biofeedback, you can train your mind to control involuntary body processes
heart rate, blood pressure... Temperature.
I'm glad you enjoyed the performance.
so you're working undercover?
which you just blew for me. Thank you very much.
well, I doubt that.
up to the moment you left, you had them transfixed.
what's that like...
such power over people? - You tell me.
I expect this robocop routine of yours normally works quite effectively.
normally.
but you seem immune, so I may have to step up my efforts.
or we could go back to cbi right now and conduct the interview you owe me.
Patrick? Everything okay?
Yeah, I was just getting some air. I'll come back in now.
how was Ripple's a. A. Group? Did you learn anything?
Yes. They're very big on hugs. - About the victim?
well, I'll learn more tomorrow when I speak with his sponsor, who is now my sponsor, too. May walters.
lovely lady-- or a killer. I can't tell.
you went undercover?
Yes. Why is that so hard to accept?
you never go undercover. - Precisely.
I wanted to have some fun, just like you guys seem to.
anything on the other santas?
Santa Bob has motive. I'm running down his alibi.
they did give us a new lead.
Hello, Roxy Rhodes.
real name-- Roxanne Rabinovich.
no record, but she works at an elite escort service.
spent an evening with the victim the night before he died.
whoa. Santa got some naughty this year. - Yeah.
we should bring her in here tomorrow.
Yeah, I can question her. - It's my lead.
just offering to help out. - All right.
we have a situation. Someone broke into Ripple's apartment.
now two hours after we cleared the crime scene, we get a call from a neighbor, says she hears a lot of crashing inside the apartment.
looks like they were looking for something.
any signs of forced entry?
none. We think somebody had the key.
do you know this man?
sure. Benjamin.
we hung out.
he was murdered two days ago.
okay. - You don't seem very broken up over this.
why should I be? I don't marry them.
just provide a standard g. F.E. - G. F.E?
girlfriend experience.
I'm paid to show up and act like I like them, but I don't get emotionally involved with clients.
that way madness lies, you know?
and Ripple was a client. - No...
but you were his date at the santa convention?
I was paid by someone else.
and how does that work?
I'm paid to attend a. A. Meetings and recovery groups and recruit patients.
patients for what?
this man, Jack Wilder.
he owns a treatment facility for alcohol addiction.
very exclusive. Only the financially secure can afford it.
so let me get this straight-- Wilder hires you to cruise a. A. Meetings looking for rich drunks?
I meet 'em, chat 'em up, and tell them about this miraculous treatment facility that changed my life.
so you underwent the treatment?
no. Tequila is my dear friend.
but that doesn't mean the center didn't change my life.
you should see my new jaguar.
no doubt.
do you have an address for Wilder?
you were very brave yesterday, sharing like that.
Nah. You were in love with Benjamin, weren't you?
it's why the program doesn't encourage opposite-sex sponsors.
but he didn't return the feelings.
I think he did... In his own way.
but Benjamin had his priorities.
the red suit.
I imagine that left you feeling ignored?
alone? Angry?
got that right.
angry enough to destroy his home?
who are you?
I'm a consultant for the cbi.
we're investigating Benjamin's murder.
you lied about your addiction?
no. That's real enough, I suppose.
where were you the night Benjamin was killed?
alone in my apartment.
may, they're gonna treat you like a suspect.
you destroyed their crime scene.
I went there to find something.
you know, to--to remember Bbenjamin by?
when I saw the decorations, I-I got mad.
Santa was... Was another form of addiction for Benjamin.
any time anything cuts you off from experiencing your life, i-it's unhealthy, right?
wouldn't know.
last week, for the first time in ten years, he took a shot of vodka.
it crushed both of us.
is this what you were looking for in Benjamin's apartment?
best ten years of my life.
Jack Wilder, behavioral therapist. Sorry to keep you waiting.
agent Lisbon, Van Pelt. We're with the cbi.
we came to see if Benjamin Ripple was a patient here.
uh, you know what?
let's talk about this in my office.
this is a licensed medical facility, ladies.
my client list is privileged.
are you a doctor?
technically, no, but I do have a license-- well, this is a homicide investigation.
you're a suspect. There is no privilege here.
homicide?
Benjamin's dead?
with enough alcohol in his system to kill an elephant.
a girl from an escort service says that you paid her to steer Benjamin to your clinic.
is that correct? - That's impossible.
my clients would never take a drink so soon after treatment. When did he die?
two nights ago. When did you treat him?
two nights ago.
aversion therapy can be used to treat any bad habit
uh, smoking, alcoholism, gambling, violence... Sexual deviancy.
my methods are based on classical conditioning techniques.
please.
I can turn the pleasurable activity of drinking into a repulsive one by pairing it with noxious smells, nausea-inducing medication, low-grade electric shock.
of course, I record all my sessions on a hard drive for insurance reasons, so...
uh... Ah, here we go.
he's blowing . 20. - 150 over 90. we should stop now.
he's okay.
who is that nurse there?
uh, Lailah Bloom.
registered nurse. Ten years e. R. Experience behind her.
she monitors my patients every step of the way.
we have very strict safety protocols.
how you feeling, Bbenjamin?
beautiful.
uh, sleepy.
I love this guy.
all right, you can turn the camera off now.
let's get you home.
as you can see, he was perfectly fine.
after treatment, I drove Benjamin back to his apartment.
you were inside his home the night he was killed.
I make sure all my patients get home safely.
what I offer here is a very personal, hands-on therapy.
it's the only way to make effective change in people's lives.
that and call girls.
it's an interesting way to drum up business.
what you see as a call girl, I see as a marketing expert with keen insights into the needs and desires of my clientele.
I focus on highly driven professionals.
give us a few minutes?
sorry.
men like Benjamin have more to lose if they can't control their urges.
before you trash my method talk to my patients.
my success rate is higher than any alcohol treatment center in the state.
excuse me. I need to make a call.
and I'd like to see that entire video.
Lailah, right? You okay?
fine.
no, you're not. Talk to me.
did mr. Wilder tell you what happened after I turned off the camera?
benjamin passed out.
his breathing was shallow, his temperature was dropping.
alcohol poisoning?
Yes. I told mr. Wilder we should get Benjamin to a doctor
a medicaldoctor.
but he said he had it under control, and they left.
has anything like that ever happened here before?
look, I think mr. Wilder is a great man, okay?
I grew up with alcoholic parents, so I'm a big believer in pushing limits to find a cure.
but now... I don't know.
thanks for talking to me.
Lailah said Ripple was showing signs of alcohol poisoning.
the coroner told me that's consistent with what he found at autopsy.
okay, so Jack Wilder drives Ripple home.
maybe Ripple passes out, Wilder can't revive him, so he stages a suicide rather than risk losing it all.
there's only one problem.
the evidence is circumstantial.
all of it. I don't even think we have enough for a search warrant.
what kind of character witness do you think Lailah would make in court?
she does feel loyalty for Wilder.
I checked her employment history.
she left a $70, 000 job at sacramento general two months ago to work for him.
on the other hand, both her parents were alcoholic.
I think that's where her real sympathy lies.
parents were alcoholic?
her mom died in a car crash.
she was drunk.
cirrhosis of the liver took her dad. Also alcohol-related.
chance has thrust our way a very sordid and vexing problem.
but have no fear.
we don't.
I do what's your plan
thank you for, uh, fitting me in.
our corporate retreat is in two days.
that's why it's crucial to get started now.
you're sure you've had nothing to eat today?
no, no, no. To stressed to eat.
they say it's a rafting trip.
it's really just an excuse to drink like Germans for a weekend.
I can't afford to slip. I'm up for c. E.O.
don't worry, Patrick. All behavior is learned.
and with my help, soon, your unwanted behavior will be unlearned.
now I want you to take this dial.
and select a level of current that's uncomfortable but not painful.
tickles.
okay. Touchy.
tonight, we are gonna take the fun out of drinking for you.
Lailah, pour the man some whiskey.
bottoms up.
I felt that.
I did feel that.
our goal is to associate alcohol and all of its social rituals with the unpleasant sensation of electricity running through your body.
okay
good. Good, good.
taxi.
how you feeling, Patrick?
well, Lailah, I'm probably not going to remember much about tonight, so let's just take a moment to remember this moment forever together.
you have brown eyes and you're wearing earrings.
I'll never forget that.
time to raise the current.
Really?
these restraints will make sure you don't accidentally dislodge your electrodes.
we don't wanna dislodge any electrodes, do we, doc?
ready for the next one?
uh... Here's to sobriety.
this is the last one.
are you okay?
he's fine, Lailah.
he's just a little tipsy.
this is the most important one.
please continue.
okay.
I feel like... I can move.
the air doesn't stop me.
his eyes are pretty red.
yours are glazed. You been eating doughnuts?
the patient's blood pressure is too low.
something's wrong.
no, it's okay.
you set me free of all my pain.
irregular heartbeat.
skin's ice. - No, no, no. It's impossible.
I calculated his body weight.
this man will go into cardiac arrest without emergency medical care.
go call 9-1-1. go!
I'll set you free. Forever.
gotcha.
whoa, little head spin there.
you can't be conscious.
your vitals... - Little biofeedback trick.
well, not so little when you're drunk.
cat's in the bag. Come on in.
what are you talking about?
I'm a cop.
well, cop-adjacent.
this place is surrounded.
it's a complex little transmitter.
surveillance van out the front full of people with large guns.
you are in trouble.
you're lying.
let me guess. 190-proof alcohol.
same gut-rot you shot into Rripple.
the good doctor here thinks you're an angel.
I am an angel.
Yeah. An angel of death.
you know, I had a hunch soon as I found out about your pants.
pardon me. Your parents.
you've experienced a lot of pain.
alcohol causes pain.
loneliness.
it was you that overdosed Ripple. It wasn't Wilder.
he left and you went in. How did you get into Benjamin's apartment?
when Benjamin was drunk, he mentioned where he kept his spare key.
poor thing was hurting so badly inside.
Benjamin, wake up.
it's important. Hmm? Huh?
uh... There are children outside.
Oh... They wanna see santa.
Oh, can't let the children down.
I'm not feeling so good.
all you gotta do is wave at them.
OK - You see 'em down there?
maybe if you lean a little further.
you see 'em?
do you know the one part of the body that coroners rarely inspect for needle marks?
inside the navel.
uh, cat's in the bag, and the bag's almost in the river!
if I end your suffering now, Jack will be blamed for both deaths.
and let's face it, Jack needs to be stopped.
he's a little crazy.
drop the needle! Put it down! Now!
I'm sorry. We didn't mean to cut it this close. This place is a maze.
turn around.
are you all right? - Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm still home.
would you take me drunk?
Mr. Laroch?
what's going on here?
I've come to questioJjane about the murder of Todd Johnson.
unless he answers my questions, his status as a cbi consultant will fall under immediate review.
no more waiting, no more ducking.
no, you don't. Not now. No.
no, it's all right, Lisbon. I got this one. I got him. Come on.
fire away.
I got it. Okay.
agent Lisbon states that before Todd Johnson was set on fire, he indicated to her that he had a secret he wanted to tell you, and you alone.
we all have secrets.
most of them are quite unremarkable once revealed.
what's your secret, mr. Laroosh?
Laroche. - Pardon me.
I have no secrets.
none?
you have a very keen, speculative mind.
you flatter me.
what do you think Johnson wanted to tell you?
what was his secret? Your best guess.
best guess.
uh, same sad old story.
just wanted to explain himself.
wanted to show someone that he was human.
he's just a lonely soul trying to get by like you or me.
why did he have to tell you this?
because he's a cop killer... In a cop house, full of cop hens and cop chickens.
that's very amusing.
and I'm not a cop.
but you would be very surprised how unsympathetic policemen can be... And women.
thank you.
Oh, no. Thank you.
it was fun.
we'll be in touch.
Oh, if you, uh... Care to share any of the developments on the case with me, then I won't tell anyone.
why would you wanna know?
I love a mystery.
it's one of my failings.
Ah, Virgil.
meet May. May, this is Virgil.
Hello, May.
a moment alone, please, Jane?
will you excuse us?
sure.
excuse me. A little parched.
thank you for meeting me here.
you look terrible.
what did you do last night?
Ah, it's all a little gauzy.
I hope you don't mind I brought May along.
uh, you know, what's her story?
Oh, come on. Ask her yourself.
listen, I'd, uh... I'd like to convey my gratitude.
easy, cowboy. You just met her.
I'm not talking about that.
what you said about that fish.
you opened my eyes to some ugly truths that I've been avoiding.
Laroche's suspect list, secured through back channels and personal favors.
Laroche has no idea I have it.
thank you.
you need anything else, let me know.
I will. I have to go.
uh, could you do me a favor?
could you extend my apologies to May?
perhaps you'll sit with her and have some lunch?
I can do that, I think.
any tips?
uh, yes. You might wanna consider growing a beard.
it's funny, isn't it?
dead cars are quite beautiful in their way, whereas dead people
not so much.- Huh?
I suppose if we were cars, this place would be a horrific charnel house.
it's too early for philosophy.
never too early.- Hey Cho - Over here.- I got something to show you.
Hey, we've got an unidentified female, somewhere in her late teens, early 20s.
a little notice would've been nice.
be grateful it's wintertime. It could be a lot worse.
looks like she was bludgeoned multiple times around her left temple.
there's some serious blunt force trauma to the back of her head as well.
somebody wanted her good and dead. How long has she been down?
from the decomposition of the body, she's probably been out here at least a week.
is that the guy who found her?
Yeah, came across the victim when he was combing through the van.
it looks like somebody took something off of her after she was already here.
a watch or a bracelet, I'm guessing.
left the earrings though.
found a set of tracks over there. I think they're connected.
it's a salvage area. There'd have to be lots of tracks.
Yeah, it's a long shot, but there weren't many tracks in the area, and these look pretty fresh.
smells like transmission fluid.
that's what I thought. I'll have forensics run some tests.
now if a vehicle with a leaking transmission made the track, then the driver couldn't have gone far without service.
Hey, what's-- what's his name?- Franklin.
cool, it boy. May I?
I have a way with dogs.
Hey, Franklin.
how are you?
Yeah, you're a good boy.
I thought you said you had a way with dogs.
he wanted freedom.
Franklin! Heel!
keep up, lisbon!
what's that?
Franklin, come.
get out of there, Franklin.
it's a foot!
another body. Are you done?
Hey, what do you say, Franklin? Are we done yet?
huh, we done?
the cadaver dogs didn't find any more bodies, did they?
thankfully, no.
the test confirmed there was a lot of transmission fluid in that track at the scene.
and the tire pattern only fits a few specific van models.
I'm checking garages to see if any vehicles fitting the description were turned in with transmission problems over the last week.
all right. Cho, you mind helping him out?
is there a problem here?
no.- No, ma'am.
great. I see a name. Did we I. D. the victims?
only on one.
got a hit on her prints. It's for the second victim you found.
her name was valerie bestin.
no next of kin.
she was arrested four years ago after hitting a homeless man while driving drunk.
the M. E. puts her time of death within the last 24 hours.
Bestin was bludgeoned in the same manner as the first victim.
what about an I. D. on the other victim?
her prints haven't come up yet.
the M. E. pegs her as latina, early 20s.
do a preliminary search of the missing persons database.
maybe we'll get lucky.- Yes, ma'am.
all right, we've got two victims--one caucasian, the other probably latina.
at least a 10-year age gap between them, and judging by their clothes, Valerie had more money.
but both were bludgeoned and dumped in the same place one week after the other.
what's the connection?
library, bowling alley, nail salon. Could be anything.
well, let's focus on what we do know.
what about the homeless guy Bestin hit?
he's been in a secure mental facility since last year.
speaking of mental facilities, have you seen Jane?
I need to talk to him.
Jane?- Hmm?
Where's my couch?
Yes. I bought you a new one.
I like my old couch.- No, you don't.
you've gotta try this one.
let's discuss it later. We have to talk.
have you ever been into knitting?
what?- No, of course not.
you grew up surrounded by boys.
what are you talking about?
hi there. You seem to have very nimble fingers.
are you now or have you ever been a knitter?
no.
agent lisbon.- Yes, Dr. Montague.
it's a pleasure to meet you.
and you must be patrick jane.
I must be.
you were saying we needed to talk.
Yes, Dr. Montague is consulting on the case.
Yes, she's a decision science consultant.
she works with the FBI and state agencies.
her work helped bring in the quarry killer.
I'm developing a predictive computer model.
it identifies the patterns in crimes and assesses whether or not they were committed by the same perpetrator.
cool.
the systems flagged your two murders as the re-emergence of a killer known as "the caveman."
I remember him. He bludgeoned his victims with a wooden club.
that was ten years ago.
indeed, but the similarities between his victims and the victims in this case are statistically identical.
how so?
the caveman always picks two victims, one week apart.
same physical attributes-- brunettes, 120 to 140 pounds.
in every other respect, the choice seems entirely random
no geographic or demographic pattern.
victims are bludgeoned on the side of the head with a wooden object, no evidence of sexual assault, bodies are left in waste sites and scrap yards, and the victims are unknown to each other.
this is classic caveman.
well, at least you're wrong with conviction.
these two women knew each other.
how do you know that?
okay, so this one... Yes, now if you look at the detail in this rose, and then again at the detail in this scarf, they were both done by the same hand.
intriguing handicraft theory.
Yeah.
but even if we were able to establish a link between the victims, it doesn't exclude the caveman from being the killer.
it merely expands the modeling paradigm.
merely expands the modeling paradigm.
wasn't the caveman known for sending poetry, animal organs, even crude drawings to the police?
we haven't received anything like that.
we will.
Hi, boss. Found out that Valerie Bestin was a financial director at an online company called Agile Turtle.
Dr. Montague, this is agent Wayne Rigsby.
Rigsby, Dr. Montague's consulting on the case, and you'll be her liaison.
it's a pleasure to meet you.
why don't you show her around?
all right, I can keep you the 50-cent tour.
start in the major crimes section.
Really? A decision science consultant?
don't start. This goes way above us.
we're good to the FEDs, the FEDs will be good to us.
when in doubt, don't act out.
you just made a rhyme. When am I ever in doubt?
seriously, you start trouble, and I will...- You'll burst my bubble?
she was such a good person, you know?
she took all these underprivileged-like kids hiking at half dome earlier this year.
Mr. Beechum, did Valerie have any friends or co-workers that were young latinas?
mm, no. There's not really that many women that work here.
you had a crush on her, didn't you?
why do you say that?
attractive young woman, single computer programmer, birds, bees.
I could go on.
I'm more of an entrepreneur than a programmer these days, but that isn't an untrue statement. She was a lovely lady.
but when you made your move, she shot you down.
no. Well...
Yeah, I wouldn't really call it a move.
but there were no hard feelings.
I mean, if I killed every woman that shot me down, I would be a monster.
you know, well... I mean, I'm not... You know what i mean.
when was the last time you saw Valerie?
uh, yesterday at work.
okay, I think we're done here.
you do?- yes. Oh, actually, no.
I have one more question. Where's the nearest homeless shelter?
Valerie was deeply guilt-ridden over hitting the homeless guy.
she started collecting soap, shampoo, and crayons.
she was taking kids hiking.
she probably volunteered her time-- in a homeless shelter?
sometimes you act like I don't know jack.
more rhyming. Now that's even rapping.
sometimes you act like I don't know jack I'm-a drop a beat back there.
Yeah. Yee-yee.
of course.
she volunteered here.
that's what I told the other people.
what other people?
um, those people.
how'd you know to come here?
women are 17% more likely than men to self-direct into redemptive recourse after committing crimes.
given Valerie Bestin's lack of relapse after D. U.I. With injury incident, it only made sense that she would follow the pattern, so I called treatment facilities and shelters in surrounding areas until I found the right place.
so you... Guessed.
Ah, it's more of a scientific hypothesis, really.
just keep us in the loop.
noted.
need to head back and code these interviews.
if you'll excuse us.
you have to admit, she really knows her stuff.
I'm admitting nothing.
she's huffing and puffing.
wait. That rhymes.
like I told Dr. Montague, I didn't know Valerie very well.
but she would often bring donations with her.
desperately needed.
Ah, we're stretched pretty thin around here, so our focus is on our guests.
uh, but Paula had more contact with her than I did.
Valerie was a saint.
she never talked down to nobody.
always makin' sure we was eatin' better, drinkin' less.
Oh, when Marty died, she was, like...
Cryin'.
she really cared.
a former guest.
he passed away here a couple weeks ago.
a bad case of flu swept through here.
lot of people got sick, and poor marty's system just
just couldn't handle it, you know?
any other questions, Jane?
uh, yes, um, I do have one more question...- Yeah.
in fact. Do either of you recall whether valerie was a-a knitter?
knitting.
thank you for your time.
all right. Thank you.
just got back the forensics report.
both victims were bludgeoned with the same object.
identical wood fibers were found in both their wounds.
sounds like the caveman.
I don't think he has the patent on killing with a 2x4.
you know, we should think about a press response to this.
being ahead of media speculation makes us look less reactive.
well, hang on. We're not even sure it's the caveman.
we don't need to speak to the press just yet.
I disagree.
but I hear you... And I understand your concerns.
Yes, you hear me, most certainly.
but I doubt very much you understand my concerns.
if you're so sure that it's not the caveman, why are you reading up on his file?
I like to read.
I have insomnia.
I don't like warm milk. I'm lactose-intolerant. I could go on.
did you know that habitual mockery is a strong indicator of depression?
no. But thank you for enlightening me.
um, that was inappropriate.
I apologize.
one of these vans has to have been at the salvage area.
how many left?
nine.
Oh, we already hit eight.
God, my feet hurt.
your feet hurt?
is there some way we can work this out?
what?- I have to spell it out?
okay, look, I lied.
I lied to the P. S.U. to protect my dad, and you had to lie to cover me, and I owe you big-time.
look, I get that you're mad at me, and I'm sorry.
but please, can we move past this?
okay.- Okay?
what, like--like, we're okay, okay?
police!
Hey, what the hell, man?
CBI. We need to ask you a couple questions.
you the owner of this van?- Yeah.
you get your transmission fixed this morning?
Yeah. Why?
ma'am, where'd you get that bracelet?
at the none-of-your-damn- business store.
so did your friend Yasmeen in the back of the van know where this bracelet came from?
Oh, that wasn't a friend.
that was just a little dinner.
it's weird that your dinner's name was Yasmeen, but this bracelet you gave her has the initials "F. T." engraved on it.
imagine that.
it's too bad you forgot the matching earrings off the woman you killed.
I didn't kill anybody.
then how'd you end up with a dead woman's bracelet?
you know, decomposing bodies can still leave a lot of evidence?
only a matter of time before they match up the D. N.A. left on this bracelet to her body.
look... Sometimes I haul junk to that yard.
I was there looking around for whatever.
there she was, already dead.
the bracelet wasn't doing her any good.
too much of a wuss to be a killer.
lacking in grandiosity, only one divorce, no traffic violations.
an undercurrent of rage would normally express itself at least in a driving record.
I'm not seeing a propensity for violence here.
so you agree with me?
not our killer.
thank you.
the caveman was never known to steal jewelry off his victims, so that clears up that anomaly.
life's just one giant mathematical equation for you, isn't it?
I would like that. I confess.- This isn't the caveman.
so you say.
I got $1 that says the same thing.
I have no objection to gambling. You're on.
Oh, someone's popular.
Hardly.- What is it?
looks like a kidney.
there's a poem on the other side of that paper, I suspect?
you've seen this before?
the ladies are dead. I crushed their heads.
and after the lash, they go into the trash.
it's from the caveman.
poetry week. You could've done better than that.
I believe we had a wager.
Yeah.
from AN INDIVIDUAL CALLING HIMSELF "THE CAVEMAN,"
who CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER OF TWO LOCAL AREA WOMEN...
ms. Montague in her element.
it's not often you see a profiler basking in the spotlight.
well, Montague says that a killer like the caveman craves acknowledgment for his crimes.
giving him some attention could keep him from taking another victim early.
you like Montague, don't you?
no. I mean, I... don't dislike her.
what's to dislike?
right. Still working on, uh, where the caveman sent the package from, but we got an I. D. on the other victim.
excellent.- Fernanda Talan.
engraved initials on the back of her stolen bracelet helped make a positive match.
her cousins reported her missing about a week ago.
she worked for them at a bottling plant.
still wearing that brooch, I see, but where's the power suit?
well, wearing a palette of neutral tones is less threatening when interviewing people.
Hi- Hey, boss.
I just got Valerie Bestin's phone records.
lately she's been getting a lot of calls from Donovan Treadlow, the homeless shelter director.
he said he barely knew her.
well, he lied.
take Cho. Get the story.
Fernanda was our cousin from my mother's family.
she came to us to get away from the violence in Oakland.
this wasn't supposed to happen to her.
her brother was killed just last year, and now this?
she was going to make it.
Tranquila, Nilda.
when was the last time you saw Fernanda?
about a week ago.
she took the bus after work and just vanished.
we were worried immediately when she didn't show up the next day because she never missed work.
where did she work?- On the line.
in there?
have you see Valerie Bestin around your neighborhood?
no. We only heard about her through the news and you all.
I like the packaging. What flavor is that?
um... Probably our orange cream sodas, right, Esther?
Yes. We make natural sodas.
no corn syrup, no artificial flavors.
we employ locals, pay them right.
people used to shake their heads when we first started, but now they're getting it.
Fernanda had made a huge change here.
she wanted to be a nurse and... It's just all so sad.
is this a boy or girl? I can't really see.
it's a boy.
a boy lizard. What's his name?
Chuy.- Hey, Chuy.
ms. Montague, you're awfully quiet.
I'm sure you have some questions.
ms. Montague here-- she's, uh, super, super clever.
she's a scientist.
thank you, Mr. Jane.- Oh, pleasure.
did Fernanda ever abuse alcohol?
no.- What about illegal or controlled substances?
what are you trying to say, that Fernanda got mixed up in drugs?
I'm looking into traits and habits which might give some insight into why she was chosen by the caveman.
finding out why Fernanda's to blame for getting murdered?
what kind of quack are you?
I'm sure that's not what Dr. Montague meant.
uh, it appears that you've got this covered, so I'm just going to, uh, go inside and take a look.
ma'am, I did not mean to offend.
if you let me explain my procedure to you...
Fernanda was a sweetheart, hard worker, had gotten pretty sick a couple of weeks back, but there she was, on the job.
sick how?
stomach bug, something.
dedicated.
Absolutely.
shy at first, but then she really got into it, asking how we did things, you know, just learning the process.
can I, um, try one of these sodas?
Absolutely.
Cheers.
Yeah, that's good.
what's, uh, what's happening tomorrow night?
they're having a candlelight vigil for Fernanda.
is the Helios street line difficult to get to?
no. Bus stop is right out front.
Hey, uh, Lisbon's just finishing up in there.
won't be a moment.
What'd you find out?
various things.
all data is useful data.
so nothing then?
and you?
well, I found out how our two victims were connected.
How?- Get on the bus. I'll show you.
wait. But my car is-- nah, just get on the bus. Come on.
you had a late night conversation with Valerie Bestin the day before she died.
you say you hardly knew her, and there you are calling her at midnight.
why'd you lie?
how it looks is bad, but it was shelter business.
your wife can confirm that.
that's not necessary.- Then tell us about those calls.
Valerie was always thinking she saw me being too friendly with our female guests.
what did she see?
me comforting them.
never discount the power of healing touch.
so how often are you healing the homeless women around here?
don't make it sound so sordid.
if there were nothing wrong, your wife would be standing here.
look... Valerie kept yammering about how she was gonna tell my wife if I didn't.
so I was trying to persuade her to let me handle it in my own way.
we've looked into you, Mr. Treadlow.
you and your wife started running this shelter nine months ago?
Yes, when we moved to the area.
but this isn't the first time you lived around here.
you worked construction here.
ten years ago, right?
I did.
what are you getting at?
well, you left town in the middle of a housing boom, just after a serial killer named "the caveman" stopped murdering the local women.
and now you're back, and here's the caveman again.
crazy, right?
come on.
you need to come with us.
please.
now that, uh... Brooch that you wear all the time
does it carry any special meaning or significance?
no.- No?
I only own one piece of jewelry.
saves time and mental energy.
that's very efficient.
lucky it looks very good on you.
thank you.
that's agile turtle.
so the office where valerie bestin worked is on the same bus route as the factory where Fernanda Talan worked.
the homeless shelter's on the same line, too.
all right, that's--that's a very suggestive link, but-- Lisbon?
Yes, I ditched you.
uh, I must confess.
but look at the bright side. I left you with a car this time.
there's no need to be so grumpy. It's okay.
I call bearing news.
our victims met on the Helios line.
it's a bus route.
a bus.
public transportation. Yes.
and I would bet that the killer met the victims on this same bus.
well... It's always a pleasure.
okay. Bye-bye.
pure surmise.
Yes. Pure.
anything on the Jane bus angle?
I found out Valerie Bestin barely used her car even though she got her license back a year ago.
she mainly took the bus, just like fernanda.
Cho, I thought you were with Treadlow.
we're letting him think a while.
I'm working with the D. A.'S office to get all the personnel files released by the bus company.
I'm running filters on all the riders with bus passes to see if anything flags.
nothing as of yet.
okay, and when you're done with that, find my old couch.
I don't recall there being a strong correlation between the victims and the use of public transportation.
the caveman's adapting. I'll need to update my model.
ms. Montague, just-- doctor. Dr. montague.
Dr. Ms. Montague.- Just doctor.
Doctor?- Yes.
turn the super computer off.
sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride... And the company, if possible.
Mr. Jane.- Yes. Got it in one.
Yes.
on a notion...
you have us sitting on a bus because our victims might have been on the bus at the same time?
this is... Messy.
can I ask you a question as professionals?
two professionals-- peers, if you will.
why can't a notion, a thought, or an idea just hang out there for a moment?
just hang.
because life is order and sequence.
death is disorder, entropy.
did you know that California leads the number of serial killers in the nation?
job security, at least.
excuse me.
pardon me, ma'am.
uh, I couldn't help but notice the beautiful detail work in this scarf.
did you knit this yourself?
Yes, I did.
that's very nice. You know, you could sell these.
do you--do you--have you thought of selling these?
Yeah.
you--you want to look?
if you don't mind.
they're very nice.
she's got some great stuff here.
can I just try this on my... Lady friend?
look at this. Look at that.
it's a very similar style...- Stop.
to the one that fernanda was wearing, and it looks just terrific with her ensemble, no?
Yes.- Excuse me, ma'am.
hello. We're investigating the murder-- I'm so sorry.
no understand.
if I could just ask you-- no understand.
but if you could just wait a second, I...- Excellent people skills.
that's sarcasm.
we can work on that.
I was going through the personnel files for the bus drivers, and something flagged.
a bus driver-- his name is Ralph Mercer.
he's only been with the bus company for the last six months.
so?
according to his social security number, he's been dead 15 years.
so I did a little more digging, and fingerprint records say Mercer is actually Arthur Coffey.
not a nice guy--long sheet, including aggravated rape and assault with a deadly weapon.
he drives the same route our victims rode?
afternoon and evening shifts.
great. Where is he now?
got his route schedule from his boss. He's on the road now.
Hello, everybody. I'm Patrick.
uh, I'm sure you've all heard about the two local women found murdered.
yes?
Yes.
Fernanda Talan and Valerie Bestin-- they rode this bus every day.
Yes, they did, and we-- when I say "we," I include my charming associate, Dr. Montague.
we wanna know what you know about them...
and any other shady people that you may have noticed on the bus.
any information may be important.
any little piece of information may... Be important.
anything at all?
any detail?
okay. Thank you.
excellent people skills.
Ah, sarcasm.
that's very good. You're learning.
but, uh, I,in fact, got an excellent response.
I'm told that the driver is a little shady.
Really?
Yes, really.
how did you...
why are you guys following me?
uh, we'd like to ask you some questions.
are you cops, or... No, we're consultants with law enforcement.
actually, no, she's with law enforcement. I'm just an innocent bystander.
she lured me into this whole mess.
he's getting away. Do, uh, do something.
that's good. Like what? What am I gonna do?
drop the weapon!
facedown to the ground now!
that's nice timing.
darn! With him in the back, there won't be room for you two.
well, how are we gonna get back?
take the bus.
nice sheet, Arthur-- carjacking, extortion, rape.
now that we've found 30 bindles on you, we can add dealing as well.
I want to straighten out, okay?
I got a disease... Called addiction.
that's all it is-- the dealing.
I'm just trying to, you know, maintain.
I'm a good person that made some wrong choices.
are you the firstborn in your family, Mr. Coffey?
Yeah.
ever heard of the caveman?
sure.
from the... TV news.
you know these women?
Yeah.
they rode the bus.
they were killed by the caveman.
I mean, it was just on TV.
in fact, yeah, it was you that was on TV, said it was the caveman, right?
Yeah.
how many sexual partners have you had?
you like to cut to the chase.
um... Like 100, 150.
women? Men?
hello. women.
what is your point here?
we need to know whether you killed these women because they found out about your side business or because you're the caveman.
no. You think I'm the caveman?
no, no. You got me all wrong here. I deal a little blow, okay?
I mean, I don't do murders.
I think I'll take a lawyer now.
Meh.
well, he's the only suspect we have with a direct link to both victims.
Yes, it's all very compelling, but I'm not convinced.
and, yes, you should.
should what?
Oh, you know what.
no.- Oh, yes, you do.
no, I don't.
Yes, you do.
that bus driver's an ass, but he isn't the caveman.
I'm thinking the same thing.
his shifts at work don't match up with our timeline.
and without any hard evidence, I had to cut treadlow loose, so we have to start from scratch.
damn it to hell!- Oh, language. Please.
Bertram is on Hightower's back. She's on mine.
it's all,"catch the caveman, catch the caveman."
I hate serial killers.
caveman didn't kill Fernanda and Valerie.
trust me.- Well, how can you be so sure?
because I wrote the letter from the caveman.
what did you just say?
I wrote the letter from the caveman.
Yeah, I heard you the first time.
why'd you ask me to say it again?
it was a rhetorical question!
I just wanted to stir things up, just, you know, give montague a little prod.
I get it. She irks you.
no, she doesn't irk me. I like her.
in fact, she amuses me.
Yeah, and in the meantime, everybody is freaking out because they think there's a serial killer on the loose.
well, there is that, but... That was her story.
she made that up, not me.
undoing this is gonna be a nightmare.
the press is gonna have a field day.
I have to tell the families.
isn't there a candlelight vigil somewhere this evening?
well, I think so.
it's all gonna work out just fine.
I have... No doubt in my mind.
Dr. Montague.- Agent Rigsby.
interesting line of questioning you had going in interrogation.
Oh, well, yes, as you know, sexual promiscuity and risky behavior are reliable indicators in psychopathy.
uh, yes, you can learn a lot about a person from their sexual history.
I remember there was this one time we had this guy in custody, and he had a...
it was a... It's an inappropriate story, sexual history-wise.
this has been, uh, nice.
what has been nice?
talking with you.
Oh, well. You're welcome.
agent Rigsby.- Yes?
your tea.- Yes.
I... Will take that to go.
what, uh, agent rigsby wanted to say...
well, he--he wanted to ask you out on a date tonight.
I was... Going to go to the candlelight vigil
Oh, I got--see, I picked that thing up.
this is for you.
Rigsby picked it out.
I didn't. I have no idea what's in that box.
you didn't...- Yes, he did.
no, I didn't.
thanks for coming out.
um, Fernanda's family was kind enough to include us in this vigil because we're all working toward the same end.
we need to speak up.
we can't let a killer like the caveman hold our community hostage.
don't let Fernanda and Valerie die in vain.
uh, if you have something to say, please come forward.
good evening.
uh, excuse me.
my name is Patrick Jane.
uh, I offer my condolences.
I'm a part of the team that will bring this killer to justice.
I do have some unfortunate news.
we've just learned that the letter we believed to be from the caveman is, in fact, a very clever forgery.
so what does that mean?
bottom line--we're pretty sure that the caveman didn't kill your loved ones.
someone is using the caveman as a foil.
you all said it was him on TV.
the profiler lady said you were making good progress on the case.
she made a mistake.
I'm sorry, but it happens.
so do you know anything?
again, I'd like to apologize profusely for our error.
uh... It appears that this, uh, forger is, uh, one of unparalleled skill.
Oh, my god. That's blood.
what is that?
the profiler lady was wearing that.
Yes, she was.
I'm not a specialist, but that looks like a kidney.
there's a note.
your profiler is dead.
stupid copycat will join her at midnight.
signed from the caveman.
Oh, no.
Lisbon, where are you?
I need your help.
listen, thanks for tonight. I had fun.
so did I, Wayne.
um, I enjoyed your funny stories immensely.
good. And I enjoyed your, uh...
well, I learned a lot about statistical analysis.
I hope I didn't bore you.
no, not at all. Um, in fact, would you like to go out again?
I would.
uh... I would. Do...
you are an attractive and stable character.
thank you.
but I don't need to conduct an analysis to see that you're still in love with someone else.
the probability of us having a successful relationship is no more than 20%.
20%?- Mm-hmm, tops.
where is everybody? I thought we were working the night shift.
everybody's out catching the killer.
Seriously?
no, I'm joking.
that was sarcasm.
uh, they're out catching the killer.
Nilda, will you hurry up?
what about Chuy?
forget the lizard already!
essential items only.
it's the caveman.
this is all a big mistake.
we never meant to copy you!
we just took the bodies to the first place we thought of.
nothing to do with you, I swear.
we had no idea!
please don't do this!
boo.
I'm thinking this has to do with your natural soda.
something not so natural in it?
well, that's no secret.
a lot of foods require additives to keep them fresh.
Fernanda was giving her friend, Valerie Bestin, crates of soda to distribute to the homeless, right?
Yes.
then a man at the shelter, Martin Brent, known as Marty, died after drinking the soda, right?
I don't know any Marty.
sure you do.
I'm only telling you this so you know not to tell us stories.
why would I lie about knowing some homeless guy?
the assumption was that Marty died because his system was too weak to fight off the flu.
but when fernanda got sick, she started to do some digging.
you can't tie any of that to us.
a simple blood test will show just what additives were present in his system.
everyone at the shelter can confirm drinking the sodas.
who gave them out can be tested as well.
Esther said the soda was losing too much flavor so we started using glycol as a stabilizer.
we got a bad batch.
how bad?
Estheraid you had to drink a lot of it in order for there to be any bad effects.
most people just got an upset stomach.
it was only like 500 bottles.
you knew you were endangering the lives of your consumers.
Esther said pulling the product was too expensive and kept saying it was no big deal.
who drinks 12 bottles in one go anyway?
right, and then the homeless man, Marty, died.
Fernanda made the connection, started asking questions.
Fernanda wouldn't let it go, said we had to issue a massive recall.
she'd tell if we didn't.
and then you killed your own cousin.
Yeah, we did.
and then Valerie showed up a week later, and you knew what you had to do.
I told Esther.
that lady didn't know anything.
but she kept saying someone like her wouldn't stop coming around and asking questions.
so she had to go.
Fernanda was my prima. she was supposed to stick up for her own.
but she chose that bitch on the bus over her family.
thank you, man.
I appreciate it.
really.
it's just soda.
it's diet, right?- Yep.
Mr. Jane?- Ms. Montague.
we have some important business to conclude.
we do?
for you.
I-- hang on.
Yeah, that's good. Thank you.- Okay?
I always settle my debts.
you were right.
that wasn't a serial killer.
you remind me. I almost forgot.
thank you.
forgotten it, too.
useful brooch. Um, and I
I was hoping that, you know, you might forgive me any misdirection I might have given you.
Oh, yes.
no. No, I-I...
actually, it was bracing to have one's operating principles challenged so... Robustly.
glad to be of service.
you know, I've never participated in chicanery before.
I can't condone it as a system, but I must admit that it adds... Zest to the task at hand.
in fact, w
how did you figure it out, that it was Esther and Nilda?
just a good guess.
when we first with them, they were masking shame, not sadness.
and who likes lizards?
cold-blooded people.
lizards.
I think I shall stick with hard numbers.
I have another guess for you.
the caveman isn't coming back.
he is almost certainly dead.
possibly.
I have no personal bias on the matter.
the numbers will eventually reveal the truth either way.
they always do.
you really believe that?- Of course.
if you could stand far enough back to see the big picture, everything is numbers.
speaking of which... You gave me a gift, so I must give you one.
I ran red John through the modeling program.
you might find some of the data sets useful.
lot of figures and graphs here.
that's right.
good luck.
well, thank you.
crane
Absolutely. Sir, I'll let you know as soon as I know anything.
not at all. It's my pleasure. Crap.
director?
Bertram wants regular updates.
somebody involved in this case must be connected.
well, maybe we'll get lucky, catch a dunk. We're due an easy one.
Ugh, you shouldn't have said that. - Said what?
"we're due an easy one." now we're jinxed.
sorry.
amber Sutherland, documentary filmmaker. The house is a rental.
she's been in Crane Creek for about two months making a campaign video for mayor Kenyon Bagshaw.
isn't a campaign video overkill for a small town mayor?
well, Bagshaw's moving up.
he's running in a special election for the house of representatives.
surprise. Connected.
agent Lisbon? Chief Arnold Nail, Crane Creek p. d.
my men responded to a shots-fired call last night, found the body.
agent Cho, agent Rigsby. - Men.
your men search the area? - We found a. 38 in a trash can down the street.
serial number shows it reported stolen from a man one town over, about a year ago.
we're gonna need that. - Got it.
and just so you know, I get it.
CBI's in charge. We're here to assist.
Thanks, chief. We don't always get a welcome.
well, I said I get it. I didn't say I liked it.
looks like the killer tossed the place. Anything missing?
apparently, Amber had a lot of high-end video equipment.
