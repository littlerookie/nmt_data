democrats now have a shot at winning all four of the new seats.
democrats object to keeping tax cuts for the rich at a time when the government is struggling with deep budget deficits.
democrats of previous generations are treated more generously.
democrats of the democratic party and the republican party who wereanti-imperialists, george sewall boutwell and george hoar are republicans, cleveland and william jennings bryan were democrats;
democrats on the left are arguing that the party's problem was that it hadn't been bold enough in pursuing a liberal agenda, and that the loss of several dozen moderate and conservative house democrats illustrates the futility of tacking toward the center to appease them.
democrats painted the veteran congressman a 'right-wing ideologue' whose budget proposals would give tax cuts to the wealthy at the expense of seniors and middle-class workers.
democrats pay lip service to the need to slim the rulebook-mr obama's regulations tsar is supposed to ensure that new rules are cost-effective.
democrats played down the numbers.
democrats point out that mitch mcconnell, the leader of the republican minority in the senate, declared in 2010 that denying mr obama a second term was "the single most important thing we want to achieve."
democrats point out that the bills in question do not mention abortion.
democrats retort that mr obama can be tough when necessary.
