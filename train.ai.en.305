Pemberton knew about watchtower.
Pemberton's glow stick is m. I. A.
pembrey and his colleagues examined whether there was any connection between when a father had begun smoking and his children's weight at age 9, a measurement included in the avon study.
pembrey says the mechanism is unclear, but it may be that certain eating patterns or smoking at critical periods in life cause epigenetic changes--chemical modifications of a gene's dna rather than direct mutations--that can silence genes in sperm and eggs.
pembrey thinks not, noting that the critical periods revealed in the smoking and food studies coincide with when eggs are maturing in girls and sperm production is about to begin in boys.
Pembrey's evidence for the effects of smoking comes from the avon longitudinal study of parents and children.
Pembrey's results also indicate that postdevelopment effects can be transmitted through the paternal line.
