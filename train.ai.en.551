and that's just not gonna happen here.
and that's just not happening.
and that's just not me.
and that's just not something I think I can deal with -
and that's just one of my many odd discoveries.
and that's just one of the many inconsistencies we found in your story
and that's just one small fraction of the main attraction
and that's just one small fraction
and that's just probably a few threats in there.
and that's just something you're gonna have to figure out how you want to deal with.
and that's just such a brilliant realization of a dream, to me.
and that's just the beginning, say the biobank's curators at kaiser permanente (kp), the giant health care organization.
and that's just the beginning.
and that's just the beginning.
and that's just the beginning.
and that's just the bets we can see.
and that's just the first part.
and that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores,

and that's just the people holding the clothes!
and that's just the start.
and that's just the way it is?! Yeah, in my line of work it is.
and that's just the way it's gonna be.
and that's just this week.
and that's just ugly.
and that's just what I intend to do.
and that's just what I think I'm going to do.

and that's kind of how we think about search.
and that's kind of the good thing.
and that's kind ofa history of the book.
and that's kindly of you, what you've done.
and that's less than 30 minutes.
and that's life. Life, life, life!
and that's light over there off because it was producing a cast on the reef
and that's like kicking a puppy dog.
and that's likely to show when the new y-20 eventually takes flight.
and that's long gone.
and that's longer than any animal lives
and that's longer than any animal lives
and that's lot to give up for a quote, unquote, perfect behind.
and that's lucky for you. I know a couple of navy seals that would love to come say hi.
and that's lucky for you.
and that's lunch.
and that's made a big difference.
and that's making you feel guilty,
and that's maybe why you were late?
and that's me and Ross.
and that's me out of time.
and that's me. - mm.
and that's me? Of course!
and that's merciful compared to what'll happen in the rest of the world.
and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
and that's more fuel - efficient? - exactly.
and that's more important in a friend.
and that's more important to me
and that's more important today than ever because retractions of scientific studies are surging.
and that's more likely to be female.
and that's more than I can say for the first two.
and that's more than anyone ever said about me when I was starting out.
and that's most certainly enough for us... For now.
and that's much sooner, of course,
and that's much too late for you to eat.
and that's my baby she's carryng.
and that's my best ex-wife.
and that's my boy.
and that's my dad found that. And decided to stand against him.
and that's my final word on the matter.
and that's my godfather on the right, the best man.
and that's my intention.

and that's my point. I'm undefeated.
and that's my problem because.
and that's my problem how?
and that's my problem why...?
and that's my process, and I've kind of been crazy.
and that's my story of how I ended up at these meetings.
and that's my story.
and that's my story. Yeah, five hours of this.
and that's never gonna bring him back.
and that's never gonna change.
and that's new charges.
and that's nice of her but I'm not so sure it's a great idea.
and that's no body double, let me tell you that in advance.
and that's no different than tv or radio or magazines.
and that's no excuse.
too bad I already filled the slot for music coverage.
can you tell him we've arrived? - Gandalf?
can you tell him, no one's gonna hurt him? 'Kay, no one's gonna hurt him.
can you tell him?
the divorce settlement between vivien and olivie. Was finalized on december 2nd, 1960.
the divorce settlement came from selling hard assets...
I don't know what he is. Like, an Indian kid?
I don't know what he is.
who's never once failed to address me as my Lord.
who's never played chess in her life just kicked your ass.
not a little gal anymore.
and that's no justification for what my father did.
and that's no longer the case, is it?
and that's no small order for a social network.
and that's no way to talk to a lady.
and that's none of your business.
and that's noon. Exactly.
and that's normal, right? I mean, everyone says so. Yeah, it is.
and that's not 20-20 hindsight: many economists, myself included, warned from the beginning that the plan was grossly inadequate.
and that's not a bad idea--if bieber is in fact not the father, pursing legal action against yeater would likely deter anyone else from making false accusation in the future.
and that's not a comfortable position to be in as a designer.
and that's not a crime, last time I checked.
and that's not a crime, last time I checked.
and that's not a euphemism for, uh...
and that's not a good place for the government and
and that's not a good reason for quitting anything.
and that's not a joke.
and that's not a passive - aggressive.
and that's not a sexual euphemism.
and that's not a woman, that's a man, yeah!
and that's not a word I use often
and that's not a word that I use lightly.
and that's not all right with you. No.
and that's not all the money banks could lose in emerging markets.
and that's not all, mary lou helperman!
and that's not all. Catcher block is here. He wants to see you.
and that's not all.
and that's not all: findings from a 2008 study in spain suggested that compounds in extra-virgin olive oil seem to fight certain kinds of breast cancer.
and that's not allowed in my classroom.
and that's not because girls in iceland have more specialized brain hemispheres than do girls in italy.
and that's not cheesy, it's just healthy thinking!
and that's not counting the Festival money.
and that's not counting the lost opportunity cost of not using that land for new office buildings.
and that's not doing you any favors.
and that's not dying tonight.
and that's not dying tonight.
and that's not even a guarantee.
and that's not even counting the methane gas released by cows, pigs and poultry (which contributes to the greenhouse effect); the ammonia gases from urine; poison gases that emanate from manure lagoons; toxic chemicals from pesticides; and exhaust from farm equipment used to raise feed for animals.
and that's not even dealing with the greater agenda
and that's not even the best part
and that's not even the hard part.
and that's not even the most troubling part.
and that's not even the point.
and that's not even the scary part.
and that's not even the worst part.
and that's not even true.
and that's not fair. We need you for Regionals!
and that's not fooling anyone.
and that's not for me.
and that's not for you to decide.
and that's not free.
and that's not going to change when they arrest him.
and that's not going to change.
and that's not going to happen.
and that's not gonna be enough for long.
and that's not gonna happen.
and that's not gonna happen.
and that's not gonna hold him. I mean, he's -
and that's not gonna leave me anything.
and that's not gonna stop unless I do something.
and that's not gonna work out too well for you.
and that's not good for me.
and that's not good to listen to.
and that's not good... For you.
and that's not hate, but it's indifference.
and that's not hate, but it's indifference.
and that's not helping!
and that's not her fault.
and that's not his greatest fib.
and that's not in the paper today.
and that's not it.
and that's not just an inference.
and that's not just because cars are convenient, or because we're lazy.
and that's not just because they keep countdown calendars hanging around the office.
and that's not just money - that's the future.
and that's not just pregnant women.
and that's not just the Oxycontin talking.
and that's not just the u. s.policy on the dollar, but any hint from mainland chinese officials of what they plan for the yuan and the hong kong dollar.
and that's not like her at all.
and that's not likely to end any time soon.
and that's not likely to happen.
and that's not me?
and that's not my call.
and that's not naive?
and that's not okay with me,
and that's not police work. That's guessing.
and that's not pretend, is it?
and that's not psycho to you?
and that's not quite the way to do it.
and that's not really the quality
and that's not so good, if I'm to be a success tonight.
and that's not so good.
and that's not something I'm gonna let him do.
and that's not something you want to do.
and that's not stopping her from taking my money.
and that's not stopping you.
and that's not the impression I want her to get.
and that's not the kind of doctor I am.
and that's not the kind of life I wanted for my son.
and that's not the kind of student we want here.
and that's not the king of Versailles... That's the chimps...
and that's not the one I want in this particular situation.
and that's not the only good news. What?
