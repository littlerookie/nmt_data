you're right.
you are absolutely right.
Hello? Speaking.
when was this?
all right, I know. I understand who you are.
I just don't know how you got my phone number.
because it is a private, unlisted phone number.
Pete Peters? Yeah, I saw him yesterday.
no, I don't have any relationship with him.
he is a firking paparazzi that is trying to get pictures of me in compromising positions.
Yeah, I'm with Redman.
Redman, he's a director.
Oh, yeah. Well, he's a rapper, too.
he is a rapper. director, okay? He's a hyphenate.
bye bye.
Jennifer...
do you mind? I'm on the phone.
there's been another murder. What? No, I told you where I was.
I was right here all night with Redman.
what? I don't...
you're not telling me I'm a suspect.
all right, I'll be fine. I'm on my way.
I'm leaving. You can let yourself out.
by the way, Redman, drop dead.
Oh, Glenda.
Glenda, honey. Everything is okay.
it was just a little slip. There's no need to tell your daddy.
it will be our little secret, okay?
it's D-day here at San Quentin.
who would have thought it would ever come to this?
they're executing Martha Stewart this morning.
I don't think I can take nine months of this shit.
silly Chucky. It is a voodoo pregnancy.
it's accelerated. - How accelerated?
it is 102. 7, KIISFM, LA's number one hit music station.
Ryan Seacrest in the morning.
Ellen K, I don't know if I can take it. What's on the way?
we have bad weather on the way in LA, Hollywood, and surrounding area.
now, we're not used to bad weather. - No, we're not.
I'm not quite sure how that's going to affect my whole vibe.
this is Joan. - Joan.
I'm fat.
you're not fat. - No, I am fat. I'm huge!
for the love of Mary, I'm pregnant.
my God. No, I should have listened to you.
you said it was evil and I was going to hell.
you're right, and now God is punishing me.
.Oh, God. Is it Redman's? - No, it's definitely not Redman's.
what? -What?
it's definitely not Redman's. What an asshole.
what makes you say that?
say what? - That Redman is an asshole.
I didn't say it, you did.
no, I didn't. - So he's not an asshole?
Yes, he is.
Joan, will you please stop doing that?
doing what?
imitating me. I do not sound like that.
Yes, you do. I do.
Joan, will you shut up?
there's something really wrong with me!
I'm pregnant. I don't.
Jennifer, what's wrong?
nothing, I'm fine.
I heard you scream. I can still hear you screaming!
I mean, it's just... Well, Bound is on cable.
Gina Gershon is fingering me.
I love this movie. Don't you?
Yeah, that's really interesting, but I've got to go. Bye.
too tight? -Yes.
ain't no such thing.
what are you doing? Stop it.
what the hell is going on in here?
she came on to me.
help me! Somebody help me! - Shut her up, asshole.
what the hell is this? We had an agreement, Chucky.
we decided, for the sake of our child...
we weren't going to do this shit anymore!
no, you decided.
just like you decided our son was a girl.
he is a girl! - He is a boy, God damn it!
and he is the most promising killer I have ever seen.
you should have been there, Tiff. You would have been so proud of him.
I want a girl! - I want a boy!
you are tearing me apart!
what about what I want?
what? -What?
doesn't what I want mean anything at all?
okay, interesting. Tell us.
what do you want, Sweetface?
I think I want to be a boy.
Yes! In your face, lady!
but being a girl would be nice, too.
well, which is it?
I'm not sure. Sometimes I feel like a boy.
sometimes I feel like a girl.
can't I be both?
well, some people. - No way.
but one thing I do know for sure.
I don't want to be a killer.
Glenda. Glen. Whatever.
I'm so proud of you.
no matter what happens...
we'll deal with it together, as a family.
okay, Okasan.
wait a minute.
I'm not going to let you poison our son's mind...
with your touchy. feely, 1 2. step bullshit.
if you two don't want to kill anymore, that's your loss.
but don't look down your noses at me.
I'm not ashamed to be a killer. I'm proud of it.
it is not an addiction. It is a choice.
and it is not something that you should have to hide in a closet!
Oh, dear. - Oh, God.
well, well, well.
looks like Miss High and Mighty ain't so perfect after all.
it was just a little slip.
Rome wasn't built in a day, you know.
besides, the fucker really had it coming.
well, what about my body? - I'll take care of it.
Jennifer, I love you.
I love you.
this is Stan.
Hello, it's Jennifer.
Stan, baby, I need your body.
I'll be right there.
Jennifer, if anything happens to me, I want you to know.
they really do make a cute couple, don't you think?
.It's like my mother always said. - Christ!
enough with your mother, already.
I killed that bitch 20 years ago and she still won't shut up.
there, there. It won't be long now.
who is it?
it's that nosy bitch, Joan.
I'll take care of her.
I wouldn't want you to violate your delicate sensibilities.
Jennifer?
Jennifer!
Jennifer.
Oh my God!
Jennifer?
look out behind you!
Joan!
No!
dang!
look, I'm not going to give you crap.
nobody is perfect, Tiff.
I got a few skeletons in the closet myself.
see?
come on, Tiff.
how long did it take to build Rome, anyway?
Glen?
guess again, Daddy.
Glenda?
that's my name. Don't you wear it out.
shit.
what did I miss?
nothing much. I just fired Joan.
looks like you win after all, Tiff. Congratulations.
you both win.
I'm a real lady. killer...
if you catch my drift.
I'm a bona fide bonus baby.
Jesus Christ, Chucky, what did you do to him?
what did I do? At least I spent time with the kid.
Glen, wake up.
stop it, Mommy. You'll wrinkle my dress.
and how do you like it? I made it myself.
like mother, like daughter, right?
"like mother, like daughter. Get it? "Mother and daughter.
I said, wake up! Right now.
mom? Dad?
what am l?
push, Miss Tilly. Push.
I am pushing, you little star. fucker!
pay no attention to little Miss Potty Mouth.
she's hormonal.
my God. It's coming.
I can see its little head.
what is it?
it's a boy.
a boy. -Thank God.
give me my baby.
I want my baby.
Chucky, we're not done here yet.
what? -Jennifer isn't done.
we've got another one here!
push, Jennifer! Push!
push it out! Push!
what's this one?
it's a girl. - Groovy.
Chucky, it's time.
give me the power, I beg of you.
Chucky, first he has to choose.
I beg your pardon.
sorry. She has to choose.
we don't have time for this shit! . wait, Chucky.
we have a son and a daughter.
Glen and Glenda.
don't you get it? Maybe they don't have to choose.
help!
hurry, Chucky! Do the chant.
do it now! - Help us!
what are you standing there for? Do the chant!
what are you waiting for? Do it!
do the chant!
do it!
everybody just shut up!
I have had it! That's it!
there is a limit to how much I can take.
what are you talking about?
look around you, Tiff. This is nuts.
and I have a very high tolerance for nuts.
if this is what it takes to be human...
then I would rather take my chances as a supernaturally possessed doll.
it's less complicated.
you can't be serious? - As a heart attack.
think about it.
what is so great about being human, anyway?
you get sick. You get old.
you can't get it up anymore. I'm not looking forward to that.
but I want to be Jennifer Tilly.
I want to be a star.
and I don't want to be your chauffeur.
as a doll, I'm fucking infamous.
I'm one of the most notorious slashers in history.
and I don't want to give that up.
I am Chucky, the killer doll!
and I dig it!
I have everything I want:
a beautiful wife...
a multi-talented kid.
this is who I am, Tiff.
this is me.
Chucky, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
I don't know who the fuck you are anymore.
but it's not enough for me.
I want more.
.What are you saying? - It's over.
you've got to get out of here, Sweetface.
I'm leaving you, Chucky, and I'm taking the kid.
nobody leaves me. Nobody!
No!
Jennifer. I... Iove...
I... Iove...
Stan, tell me. Tell me.
I love... - What?
Jesus.
Oh, my God.
my babies. Give me my babies.
I just want to know where they are.
they're fine. They're in the maternity ward.
all right, was that so hard?
the important thing to think about now is getting well...
so you can get on with your life and your career.
I don't care about my career. I want my babies.
I'm working on it, but you're not making it easy.
I already talked to the cops. They cleared me.
they know you're not a killer.
they didn't say you were mentally competent.
what do you expect, after the story you told them?
it's true.
Yeah, well, I suggest from now on you keep that to yourself.
we'll talk later.
try to get some sleep.
wish me luck, Sweetface. Mommy is going to be a star.
I can't think of a thing to say. Fuck it!
give me the power, I beg of you.
switch! Switch! Switch! Switch! Switch...
nobody leaves me. Nobody.
I want you to be a good girl...
or boy. Whatever.
don't make the same mistakes your mom and dad made.
especially your dad.
let's go.
Glenda?
no, Dad! It's me! Your boy!
your chip off the old block!
are you proud of me now, Daddy? Are you?
attaboy, kid. Attaboy.
there, there.
it's all right.
it's going to be all right.
yesterday, she gave Dana Shelton a bloody nose...
and took pictures of it for Show and Tell.
she called the cat the "C" word.
and I'm pretty sure she's been taking money from my purse.
that's ridiculous.
Glen, he is an angel. An absolute dream.
but Glenda...
she's a bad girl, Miss Tilly. A very bad girl.
I'm not listening to this.
I hate that thing.
some of the kids really want to see her.
miss Tilly. - What?
I'm afraid of her. - Fulvia, it's only a doll.
I was talking about Glenda.
just exactly what are you trying to say?
I can't work here anymore.
what? - I'm sorry, I just can't.
if you only saw the way she looks at me...
with such hate.
all right, Fulvia, if that's what you want.
we'll miss you.
thank you, Miss Tilly. God bless.
mom got her wish. She's a bright shining star.
now we're the perfect family.
I've learned a lot about myself.
I know I'm not alone. I know I'm not a freak.
and even though we had our differences...
I know my dad really loved me.
Glen, sweetheart, come over here.
here, sweetheart, look. Here's another one.
who is it from, Mommy? - I don't know.
let's see. It doesn't say.
strange. It doesn't say who it is.
Bye, sweetheart. Don't run so fast. You're going to trip.
so anyway, he determined that he was going to go off...
I just love this movie. Don't you?
I can't think of a thing to say. Fuck it!
Oh, God!
Oh, look, when you finish wrestling with your conscience, may I suggest you return to your chamber?
leave the quest for the stone to me.
how have we lived this way all these years?
in my absence, I expect you to make it fit for the queens we are.
when I return with our prize, all of us shall be young again.
never fear, my sisters.
I will not fail.
don't you ever sleep?
not at night.
may have escaped your notice, genius, but that's when stars have rather better things to do. They're coming out, shining, that sort of thing.
Yeah, well, it may have escaped yours, but you're not in the sky anymore.
coming out is off the agenda.
shining has been suspended until further notice.
Oh, and sleeping during the day is O-U-T.
unless you have some magical ability to sleep while you're walking.
have you not got it into your thick head yet?
I'm not walking anywhere!
fine.
sit in a crater. I've had enough of you anyway.
I was gonna put you back in the sky once I'd brought you to my Victoria, but clearly, you'd rather sit on your own in the middle of nowhere forever.
and just how were you planning to get me back to the sky?
I find the fastest way to travel is by candlelight.
you've got a Babylon candle. - Yeah, I have a bubbling candle.
a Babylon candle. - That's what I said.
you said "Bubbling."
anyway, I was going to give what's left of it to you.
well, that barely has one use left.
so be grateful I'm not using it right now to get us both back to the wall.
unless you have a better way of getting yourself home.
fine!
help me up.
all right. All right. I'm helping.
and you are gonna have to walk quicker than that.
otherwise, I'll never get you back to Victoria in a week.
don't push your luck.
don't take less than a florin for him, Bernard! You understand?
Yes, Mother. - No dilly-dallying!
and don't even think of stopping at the tavern, Bernard, or you'll be sorry!
a florin for your goat, boy.
Oh.
he's a bit small to pull your cart.
you're quite right.
that's much better.
Bernard!
Bernard!
get on!
who goes there?
what do you want with me, a poor old flower...
Oh, do shut up. I know what you are and I swear by the ordinances of the sisterhood to which we both belong that I mean you no harm this day.
I wish to share your meal.
well, one can never be too careful. Sit down. I'll get you a seat.
anything else? - Nope.
what's it to be?
heads or tails?
heads.
so, stranger, where are you headed off to on this fine day?
I seek a fallen star.
she fell not far from here.
and when I find her, I shall take my great knife and cut out her heart while she still lives.
and the glory of our youth shall be restored.
fallen star?
that's the best news I've had in ages.
I could do with losing a few years meself.
so whereabouts did you...
limbus grass!
you dare to steal truth from my lips by feeding me limbus grass?
do you have any idea what a big mistake you've made, Ditchwater Sal?
how do you know my...
who are you? - Look again.
I shall not seek the star, Your Dark Majesty. I swear.
seek all you wish.
you shall not see the star, touch it, smell or hear it.
you will not perceive her even if she stands before you.
pray you never meet me again, Ditchwater Sal.
Oh, right. So let me get this straight.
you think you know we're going the right way because...
I do, though. I don't know why.
maybe it's my love for Victoria guiding me home.
please. - Yvonne, whether you like it or not...
Yvaine! My name is Yvaine, so...
how many times do I have to...
would you... Would you please slow down?
Yes, yes.
look, we're... We're going north, all right?
the wall's north.
and if you look up in the sky, even during the day, you can see the...
the evening star. That's so weird.
that's funny. Hilarious. My sides are splitting.
no, I'm being...
wait that... That was you! Really?
what... What are...
what are you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing?
sitting down. I'm tired. - Please don't do this again.
we agreed we'd stop off at the next village to eat and rest.
come on, Tristan. It's midday.
I never stay up this late! Just, please, let me sleep!
okay, you... Well, then I'll... You sleep. I'll go and get something to eat.
what are you doing?
what does it look like I'm doing? I'm making sure you don't run away.
your Highness, the soothsayer, as you requested.
south, you said.
south we went.
still no stone.
do you now propose we start swimming?
sire, I've merely relayed to you what the runes have told me.
I can do no more.
well, consult them again.
wait.
before we seek the stone, I have another question.
am I the seventh son?
Yes.
another question.
is my favorite color blue?
Yes.
has excessive begging or pleading ever persuaded me to spare the life of a traitor?
what does that mean?
that means no. - Good.
throw them again. This time, throw them high.
do you work for my brother?
so, do we continue west?
Tristan?
who's there?
Tristan, is that you?
it's not funny.
Tristan?
come on.
be careful how much magic you use, sister.
it's beginning to show.
one goat and a small enchantment. Hardly extravagant.
well, even using the ring will take its toll.
better you call on us only in dire need.
and use your runes to locate the star yourself.
I used them and she should be here.
but now they're just telling me gibberish.
it is because you must stay where you are, my sister.
she is coming to you.
Oh, be warned, Lamia. Delicacy is needed.
misery has drained her. She's barely shining.
set a trap that ensures her heart is glowing before you cut it out.
Yvaine! Yvaine!
Oh, you idiot.
you shall become human.
you are Billy, the innkeeper. I am your wife, and you're our daughter.
now, make everything ready. Our special guest will be here soon.
I mean, who's to say he'd have even kept his promise about the candle?
I just refuse to believe he's the only person in Stormhold who could've helped me.
going on and on and on. Just "Victoria this" and "Victoria that.
Tristan?
please protect our sister, Tristan.
Yvaine is in grave danger.
the unicorn came to help her.
but now they're heading into a trap.
no star is safe in Stormhold.
the last to fall, 400 years ago, was captured by the same witches who seek Yvaine now.
they tricked her, cared for her, and when her heart was once more aglow, they cut it from her chest and ate it.
there's no time to waste.
a coach is coming.
by any means possible, you must get on it.
run.
Whoa!
if Septimus insists on sending a boy to do a man's job...
no, no, no, wait, please!
I don't know a Septimus. I just need a lift.
look at me, look at me. I'm unarmed. Please.
please, let me ride with you.
I'm afraid that's impossible. I'm on a quest of enormous importance.
well, then all the more reason to take me with you.
there may come a time when you need a second pair of hands. Sir?
please. Maybe providence sent me to you just as it sent you to me.
get on. - Oh, yes. Thank you.
goodness me, my dear. Come in out of this wretched rain!
we have food and drink, a warm bed and plenty of hot water for a bath.
how do you like your bath? Warm, hot or boil-a-lobster?
I honestly don't know.
then let me choose for you, and I'll have my husband take your horse to the stable.
Billy?
now, let's get you out of your wet things, shall we?
feeling better?
much. Thank you.
the warm water's actually done me a world of good.
you see? The powers of a nice, hot bath.
and your leg? Any improvement?
that is extraordinary.
it's the very least I could do. I'm just glad you're feeling better.
you seem happier in yourself, too.
I do feel happier. Less troubled.
wonderful.
nothing like a nice soak to warm the cockles of your heart.
now, I'm only a simple innkeeper's wife, but I've been told I have a healer's hands.
I'd be glad to give you a massage.
what's a massage?
never had... Well, bless my soul.
nothing like a massage to send you off for the finest and deepest night's sleep.
I do have trouble sleeping at night.
lie on your back, dear.
why not close your eyes?
you'll drift off better that way.
Hello!
service!
maybe we should carry on and try the next inn, especially if this stone is as close as your runes say.
I'll give it one more try.
relax here, my love.
I'll be back just as soon as I've taken care of this customer.
at last. We require accommodation.
please help my friend take the horses to the stables.
Hello!
Oh.
I'm accustomed to better service, but you're awake now and that's what counts.
prepare your best room.
she got the stone. - Stone, stone.
I'll thank you not to bother my guest, sir. I am the lady of this inn.
glass of wine?
no, no, no, no, no.
no.
until my brother is dead, I have vowed to drink only my own wine.
though my friend in the stables might be glad of a drop.
your best room, perhaps?
of course.
I'm sorry. I presumed that...
traveling alone, are you?
I've just stabled my four black stallions and my carriage.
well, I say mine. It belonged to my late father.
thank you.
that's so kind, thank you very much. My name's Tristan. What's yours?
Bernard.
there was not a horse or beast he could not master.
so much so that in his youth, he took to riding a camel, which was comical.
when he passed, the carriage came to me.
she's got the stone!
she's got it! - She's got it!
and it's the largest in all of Stormhold, so they say.
how nice for you. If you'll excuse me.
wait.
that stone you're wearing. It can't be.
Oh, finally. - Yeah, good, well done, yes, sir.
well done. - Sweet.
come here. Let me see it.
you have no idea what you're meddling with.
I am Primus, the first born of Stormhold and I demand that you bring it to me!
bring me the stone! Now!
prince Primus! Don't touch anything they give you! They tried to...
are you all right? - Billy!
get him!
the burning golden heart of a star at peace is so much better than your frightened little heart.
even so, better than no heart at all.
Yvaine? Hold me tight and think of home.
No!
what the hell did you do? - What did I do? What did you do?
"think of home!" That was a great plan!
you thought of your home and I thought of mine and now we're halfway between the two!
Oh, you stupid cow! What did you think of your home for?
you just said "home"!
if you wanted me to think of your home, you should have said!
some crazy lady was going to cut your heart out and you wanted more specific instructions?
perhaps you'd like it in writing! Or a diagram, maybe!
look, Captain Shakespeare! Caught ourselves a little bonus!
a couple of Lightning Marshals!
they don't look like Lightning Marshals to me.
why else would anyone be up here in the middle of a storm?
why else would anyone be up here in the middle of a storm?
well, let's think.
maybe for the same godforsaken reason we are!
now, who are you?
let's see if a night on our lovely brig will loosen their lips!
get them in the brig! - You heard the man! Let's go!
get them into the brig and the rest of you dirty dogs, back to work!
we've got lightning to catch! Come on!
they're going to kill us, aren't they? - I don't know.
you know, it's funny. I used to watch...
I used to watch people having adventures.
I envied them.
you ever heard the expression, "Be careful what you wish for"?
what? So ending up with my heart cut out, that'll serve me right, will it?
no. No, I didn't... I didn't mean it like that.
look, I admire you dreaming.
shop boy like me,
I could never have imagined an adventure this big in order to have wished for it.
I just thought I'd find some lump of celestial rock and take it home, and that would be it.
and you got me.
if there's one thing I've learned in all my years watching Earth, it's that people aren't what they may seem.
there are shop boys and there are boys who just happen to work in shops for the time being.
and trust me, Tristan, you're no shop boy.
you saved my life. Thank you.
well, well, well.
the last brother dead.
which means that I'm king.
I'm king!
not yet, brother.
damn. I still need the stone.
your brother doesn't have it? - Well, why don't you find out?
where is my stone?
I don't...
the man, see, your brother... I heard him speak of a stone.
Yeah. The girl had it. The girl had it.
what girl? - I don't know.
a girl. She got away. Because this was a trap set up for her, but your brother, he come just straight into it.
a trap? Set by who?
a woman you should pray you'll never meet.
she's...
she's gone. She took your brother's carriage.
this woman wanted my stone?
no. She wanted the girl's heart.
she said the girl was a star and she wanted to cut out her heart and...
eat it?
Oh, my God.
do you have any idea what this means?
everlasting life.
king forever.
it's not here, sire.
this idiot's coming with us.
ask again. - We have asked again and the answer is still the same. She is airborne!
well, she can't remain so forever.
inform me as soon as she touches ground!
Lmmediately! Do you understand?
watch your tongue, sister! It is you and not we who've lost her.
lost her and broken the knife!
even if you apprehend her, how will you complete the deed?
perhaps you should return now and one of us set out in your place.
don't be absurd.
I'll bring her home and deal with her there.
be sure everything is ready for our arrival.
tell me about Victoria then.
well, she...
there's nothing more to tell you.
because the little I know about love is that it's unconditional.
it's not something you can buy.
hang on. This wasn't about me buying her love.
this was a way for me to prove how I felt.
and what's she doing to prove how she feels about you?
well...
look, Yvaine, you'll understand when you meet her. All right?
provided we don't get murdered by pirates first.
murdered by pirates. Heart torn out and eaten. Meet Victoria.
I can't quite decide which sounds more fun.
we've located the sky vessel.
it's headed north for the port town on Mount Drummond and you are no longer the only one seeking the star.
there's someone following your tracks!
a witch? A warlock?
a prince and he's catching you up! Get a move on!
so, this is the part where you tell me who you are and why you're up here.
or I'll snap her pretty little fingers one by one like dry twigs!
my name is Tristan Thorn.
this is my wife, Yvaine. - Your wife?
far too young and radiant to belong to just one man!
it's share and share alike aboard my vessel, sonny boy!
if you dare even touch her...
you may think you're showing a little spirit in front of your lady friend, but if you talk back to me again, I'll feed your tongue to the dogs, you impertinent little pup!
sir? - Better! But still interrupting.
let's see. A hanging's always good for morale!
maybe we'll watch you dance a gallows jig!
or perhaps I'll just tip you over the side and have done with it!
it's a very long way down.
plenty of time to reminisce about your pitifully short lives.
please, look, we're just trying to make our way home, back to a place called Wall, where I come from.
what did you say?
I said we were trying to get home to Wall.
that's one lie too many, my son.
wall? - Shut up.
what's he saying?
thought you could just wander onto my patch, did you?
he is. Yeah, he's gonna... - And live to tell the tale?
all right, go, on the deck, on the deck, on the deck! Now, go, go, go!
big mistake, Mr. Thorn! And the last one you'll ever make!
No! No! You brute! - Come... Come on!
you murderer! You pig! - Come on! Get up! Get up!
I'm taking the girl to my cabin, and mark my words, anyone who disturbs me for the next few hours - will get the same treatment! - What? You'll...
no, you idiot! I'll sling you over the side as well!
Oh, yeah.
captain's busy. So should you be.
get in there, wench!
so, that went well, I thought.
now, tell me news of my beloved England.
I want to hear absolutely everything.
hang on. I can't believe your crew fell for that.
and where in God's name did you get that mannequin from?
Oh, it works every time.
an ounce of bargaining, a pinch of trickery, a soupcon of intimidation, et voila!
the perfect recipe for a towering reputation without ever having to spill one drop of blood.
ever try to get blood stains out of a silk shirt? Nightmare.
right. I still don't understand how they won't recognize me.
Tristan, dear boy, when I'm done, your own mother won't recognize you.
now, we've no time to waste.
we have only two hours before we make port.
first and foremost...
it'll be so good to see you out of those dreary clothes.
so very small-town errand-boy. Howlingly parochial.
here. Tres you.
I wore it as a younger man. I hate to throw anything away.
you know the day you do, it'll come back in fashion, be oh, so de la mode.
now, you, darling.
I have some lovely dresses. Take your pick.
Oh, no, really, I'm fine.
honey, you're wearing a bathrobe.
now, England, England. I want to hear everything.
you're not from England. - Oh, no, sadly, no.
but from my earliest youth, I lapped up the stories.
people always told me they were nothing more than folklore, but my heart told me they were true.
as a boy, I'd scurry away from my father at the market while he did his deals just to peek over the wall, dream of, perhaps, crossing it one day, seeing England for myself.
Really? So you... You were here looking over there.
Oh, yes.
hair. - Hair?
mind you, I did my best to fit in.
tried to make my father, Captain Ghostmaker, proud.
forged a decent reputation as a ruthless marauder and cold-blooded killer.
but my father died.
I always promised him I'd take over the family business, keep the old girl flying.
you have no idea the lightness it brings to my heart being able to confide in you charming young people.
the pressure of maintaining the whole Captain Shakespeare persona for the sake of the crew, I don't know.
sometimes...
you see, I'm very much a man of my own creation.
even chose the name specially. Took me ages.
see, I'm thinking legendary British wordsmith.
my enemies and crew are thinking, "Shake! Spear!"
it's little things like that make me happy.
I don't understand that.
surely it would make you happier just to be yourself.
why fight to be accepted by people you don't actually want to be like?
Yeah. Why would anyone do that to himself?
exactly.
port ahoy! Ready the lightning barrels!
hurry up.
Yeah. Doesn't seem very fresh. I'll be honest.
shall I give you a little taste, young Ferdinand?
no, no. Oh, there you go.
brilliant. Like they're cheap.
I think it's still crackling, very much alive, still tres fresh.
so, name your best price. - For 10, 000 bolts?
ten thousand bolts of finest quality grade A.
Yeah, but it's difficult to shift, isn't it? Difficult to store.
if I get the Revenue Men in here sniffing round, what's the...
best price, 150 guineas.
gentlemen, put the merchandise back onboard and prepare to sail.
whoa, whoa, whoa. - Ferdinand, always a pleasure.
hold on. Hold on. One minute. Hold on, cuddles.
Oh, he's... - One-sixty. One-sixty.
seeing as I'm feeling particularly generous today,
I'll settle for 200.
two hundred? Okay. You're having a laugh.
have you had your head in that?
has he been sailing up where the air's too thin?
you're being very rude. - Not anymore.
two hundred. - One-eighty.
two hundred. - That's not negotiation.
I'm changing my number. One-eight-five.
did I hear 200? - From you, you did. Yeah.
you said 200. - Lf I did, you're a ventriloquist.
okay, one-nine-five. Final offer.
One-nine-five it is. So, with sales tax, that's, let's see, 200.
brilliant. Put it in the back.
unbelievable. Here.
yes? Can I help you?
nosy.
have you heard any of these rumors going round about a fallen star?
everyone's talking about it.
you get your hands on one of them, we can shut up shop. Retire.
fallen star? - Yeah.
nothing on your travels? - No.
not even a little sniff of a whisper?
everyone's going on about it down at the market.
which market? The market near the wall?
Yeah.
well, Ferdy, you're wasting your time listening to gossip from the kind of pond scum trading down there.
well, if it... - Oh, my word! Speak of the devil.
Oh, yeah? What were you saying, then?
Oh, what a wonderful woman you are, Sal.
how the world wouldn't be the same place without you.
you look great. You've had your feet done, haven't you?
but, you two, you have business to attend to. Sal. Ferdy. Good day.
come on. I've got something new for you.
captain Shakespeare.
stand down!
meet my nephew, the fearsome buccaneer,
Tristan Thorn.
he'll be joining us for our journey home.
I have the perfect gift to keep you amused on the way.
Oh...
right, you lazy dogs!
let's get young Tristan on his way home!
Touche.
I'm impressed.
Yvaine, I know what you are.
no, no. Have no fear.
no one on this vessel will harm you, but there are plenty who would.
your emotions give you away, Yvaine. You must learn to control them.
you've been glowing more brightly every day, and I think you know why.
of course I know why I'm glowing. I'm a star.
and what do stars do best? - Well, it's certainly not the waltz.
now try. - Okay.
see? - Very good.
due west, you say?
and you're certain he had a girl with him?
Yeah.
you're sure? Absolutely sure? Sure you're not lying?
I'd cross my heart if I had one.
brilliant. - You'd better be telling the truth, you two-faced dog.
I can get you one of them, actually. Very good guard dogs.
they can watch the back and the front door at the same time.
I can get you anything you want.
what are the chances of getting a Babylon candle?
that one's slim.
although, I did know a girl once, if you know what I mean...
I'm a ladies' man.
...who had a sister...
I think it was a woman.
Oh, she was terrible. Face like a bag of frogs. Ugly frogs.
enough.
hold on tight! The Captain's at the helm!
so there's the road you'll need for Wall.
good luck on your journey home, Yvaine, wherever that may be.
and good luck to you, Tristan, with your Victoria.
Oh, how can we ever thank you enough for your kindness?
don't mention it. No, seriously, don't mention it.
reputations, you know. A lifetime to build, seconds to destroy.
Oh, and Tristan, just remember...
just think about it.
well, give my regards to England. It's been a pleasure to meet you both.
mind you don't wear that wench out, Captain Tristan!
what did he say to you?
what did he say when?
just then. When he whispered to you.
no... No, he... He was just saying we should use the lightning to get you a Babylon candle.
barter for it, you know.
for the last time, where is the girl?
the girl with the stone! Where did she go?
are you mocking me? - No...
cause if you are, believe me, you have seconds to live!
what a freak.
clean this thoroughly.
bollocks.
if you have quite finished squandering your magic on your rather counterproductive beauty routine, you might like to know that the star has returned.
she's back on land.
I know, damn it. I couldn't reach the lake in time.
no matter. We have found her. She is on the road to the village of Wall.
if you take the shortcut across the marshes, you should arrive in time to intercept her.
Yvaine.
are you trying to break my leg again? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I just... I can't risk people seeing you. I don't trust anyone.
but at this rate, if we keep stopping...
Yvaine. We're making good time. Just leave it a minute.
aren't you tempted?
tempted? By what?
Lmmortality.
let's say it wasn't my heart.
not me. Just a star you didn't know.
you seriously think I could kill anyone?
I mean, even if I could... Everlasting life?
I imagine it would be kind of lonely.
well, maybe if you had someone to share it with Someone you love.
maybe then it might be different.
come on, I think we're safe.
now remember, Captain Shakespeare has a fearsome reputation.
what the hell is this? - What are you doing here?
my name is Prince Septimus.
and you're going to tell me where I can find the girl.
all right, twinkletoes. I'm gonna count to three. One, two...
you know, you sort of glitter sometimes. I just noticed it. Is it normal?
let's see if you can work it out for yourself.
what do stars do?
attract trouble?
that's... All right, I'm sorry. Wait, I'm sorry.
all right, let me... Let me... Do I get another guess?
is it... Do they know exactly how to annoy a boy called Tristan Thorn?
how long will that take? - Maybe two days.
but we don't have two days. Victoria's birthday is tomorrow.
Yes, it is. Well remembered.
nice cup of Earl Grey. - Get out, everybody. Get out.
did he hurt you, Captain?
did you tell him where your nephew and the girl went?
so what's the problem?
it's my reputation.
no. No, no. Don't be silly. Nonsense.
it's all right, Captain.
we always knew you were a whoopsie.
you'll always be our captain, Captain. - Aye, aye, Captain.
captain.
Yeah. Let's go, let's go.
prince Septimus, your men, they're dead.
Oh, really?
go on!
I met that woman. She's friends with the Captain.
he said she trades at the market near Wall.
we could hitch a lift. - Really? She's a friend of the Captain's?
you sure? - Yes, yes.
wait! Sorry! My name is Tristan Thorn. This...
that's my flower.
eighteen years I've been looking for that.
give it to me now!
how dare you? That was a gift from his mother!
Oh.
perhaps I was mistaken.
it's all right.
it's obviously very valuable to you, so you can have it in exchange for what I need.
a Babylon candle? - And safe passage to the wall.
a Babylon candle?
Oh, no, no, no. I don't deal in black magic.
Really?
well, can you give us a lift then? To the wall?
well, why didn't you say so in the first place?
for that flower, I can offer you passage.
food and lodging on the way? - Safe passage.
I swear that you will arrive at the wall in the exact same condition that you're in now.
do you have any idea what manner of thing it was that you had?
some kind of lucky charm?
a very lucky charm indeed. Protection.
in fact, the exact same thing that would've prevented me from doing this.
Oh, my God! What did you do? - Much better.
you shall not see the star, touch it, smell or hear it.
though I'll keep me word. You shall not be harmed.
there. Food and lodging just as I promised.
would I be correct in thinking that you can neither see nor hear me?
then I'd like to tell you that you smell of pee.
you look like the wrong end of a dog.
and I swear, if I don't get my Tristan back as he was,
I'll be your personal poltergeist!
Tristan?
if you can understand me, look at me now.
you know when I said I knew little about love?
well, that wasn't true.
I know a lot about love.
I've seen it. I've seen centuries and centuries of it.
and it was the only thing that made watching your world bearable.
all those wars. Pain and lies. Hate.
made me want to turn away and never look down again.
but to see the way that mankind loves.
I mean, you could search the furthest reaches of the universe and never find anything more beautiful.
so, yes, I know that love is unconditional.
but I also know it can be unpredictable, unexpected, uncontrollable, unbearable and, well, strangely easy to mistake for loathing.
what I'm trying to say, Tristan, is
I think I love you.
my heart, it feels like my chest can barely contain it.
like it doesn't belong to me anymore. It belongs to you.
and if you wanted it, I'd wish for nothing in exchange.
no gifts, no goods, no demonstrations of devotion.
nothing but knowing you love me, too.
just your heart in exchange for mine.
the wall is one mile that way.
there. Though the walk might take you a little longer than normal.
transformation tends to leave the brain a bit scrambled for a while.
you...
Oh!
I warned you. Save your strength.
I've been so worried about you.
Victoria.
I think I preferred "Mother."
come on. There's an inn over there. Victoria's birthday's not till tomorrow.
I think you need a bath and a good night's sleep before you present me to her.
come on. Come.
come on, Tristan. It's not that far. - Okay.
excuse me? - Oh!
I think you're in my bath. - Well, close your eyes!
I'm not... Honestly, I'm not looking. Here, I'll turn away.
all right, you can open them now.
did you really mean what you said in the caravan?
what I...
but... But you were a mouse!
you were a mouse! You wanted cheese! You didn't...
I asked you to give me a sign.
and risk you being too embarrassed to keep saying such lovely things?
you want to know what the Captain really whispered to me that day?
he told me that my true love was right in front of my eyes.
and he was right.
Hey, guys! Guys, come on! Come on, you got to come up and see this!
no, thank you.
pervert! - Suit yourself.
ironic, isn't it? - Yeah. What is?
Septimus will be here by the morning, find the girl, get the stone and be king forever.
so unjust.
still, at least we will be free.
you're very close. She's in the market town.
one mile from the gap in the wall.
you speak as if this is good news.
do I need to remind you that Wall is not part of our universe?
if she crosses the threshold into the human realm, our star becomes nothing more than a pitted lump of metallic rock.
then I suggest you hurry up!
what?
Oh, what do you want?
sorry. Can I have a piece of paper and a pen?
ask me again at a more reasonable hour.
no, I can't. I have to go.
look, if my friend wakes up before I get back, - please, can you give her a message? - Go on.
you know, that's the first time I've ever slept at night.
I can't believe it.
Tristan?
have you seen my friend?
he left absurdly early.
he left?
he told me to tell you he's gone to see Victoria because he's sorry, but he's found his true love and he wants to spend the rest of his life with her.
what?
are you sure? - I'm positive.
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait!
happy birthday.
Tristan.
what happened to you?
I found the star.
I can't believe you did it.
Where's my star? Can I see it?
is it beautiful? - Yes.
well, it's awfully small.
well, that's just a little piece. A token for your birthday.
well... Well, then forget about the star.
it's not the star that I want.
you know what I want.
Yeah. I do.
you want to grow up and get over yourself.
Humphrey. - Thorn.
you must have a death wish.
Humphrey. Humphrey, it's all right.
she's all yours.
you really are a perfect couple. The best of luck to you both.
well, why would I want this? It's just a measly handful of stardust!
Yvaine?
she can't cross the wall.
go on!
stop! Stop! If you go through there, you'll die!
what?
if you set foot on human soil, you'll turn to rock.
wretched slattern! Where have you taken me?
planning to enter Wall, were you?
if death is what you wish, my dear, I'd be more than happy to assist you.
are you talking to me?
you. Small world.
anyhow, no, I wasn't. I was talking to the star.
what star?
my slave girl's no star. Any fool can see that.
if she was, I'd have had the heart out of her chest a long time ago, trust me.
trust you? Not a mistake I'd be likely to make again.
what's it to be, Ditchwater Sal? Heads or tails?
Oh, God. Time to go. - She's not going anywhere.
I think you'll find she is.
it's all right. You can come, too.
you can ride in the carriage or be dragged behind it. Your choice.
what happened?
be my guest. I quit.
eighty years I've stopped you people going out.
what I should have been worrying about was those people from the other side coming in.
all right, just tell me what happened!
what happened? Oh, where to start?
No!
come on!
go on!
the star!
and who else?
a slave for us. It will be nice to have someone to help mop up when we've finished with our little guest.
Oh, good work, sister.
and just in time, I see! You look awful!
who are you?
what business do you have here?
Septimus?
I knew your brother, Primus.
unless you wish to meet him in the afterlife,
I suggest you answer my question. What are you doing here?
I might ask you the same thing.
there are four of them.
do as I say and we may stand a chance.
wait. How do I know you can be trusted?
you don't. Why? Do you have a choice?
no. - Well, then, let's go.
get off me! Get off!
una? - Septimus.
Una! - Sister!
Tristan! No! Tristan!
I'm your... I'm your... I'm your mother.
I'm your mother.
rather well. - Good riddance to you. Yes.
Oh!
let's put out those flames.
shall we?
so, what happens now?
we have to learn to live with each other.
forever?
let's get on with it.
be the man that I know you are.
get outside. - Okay.
go.
Tristan! - Get him.
get off!
get out!
so, what's it to be, Prince Charming? Frog or tadpole?
Septimus?
Tristan!
youth.
beauty.
it all seems meaningless now.
my sisters are dead!
everything I cared about gone.
go.
go!
No!
I owe you thanks, boy.
what use was her heart to me when it was broken?
and you got rid of my sisters and now I can have it all for myself.
hold me tight and close your eyes. - What? Why?
what do stars do?
shine.
Bravo! - Yeah!
very good.
why didn't you do that earlier?
I couldn't have done that without you. No star can shine with a broken heart.
I thought I'd lost you.
but you came back.
of course I did. I love you.
come on.
Tristan.
the last surviving male heir of the Stormhold bloodline.
it's you, Tristan.
but if he's the new King of Stormhold, then...
I crown thee King Tristan of Stormhold.
Yeah!
my gift to you.
to you both.
thank you.
they ruled for 80 years.
but no man can live forever, except he who possesses the heart of a star.
and Yvaine had given hers to Tristan completely.
when their children and grandchildren were grown, it was time to light the Babylon candle.
and they still live happily ever after.
jackson came over to play.
superheroes
I was Black Ranger.
Jake? You okay? -I'm okay.
can I ask you a question?
okay. Time to hit the sack.
it's an important question.
here we go. Big guy.
can I wear bugs?
the bug pajamas are all the way downstairs.
the fire trucks are okay aren't they? -Bugs.
fire trucks.
bugs.
fire trucks!
bugs!
okay. Bugs. I'll be right back.
does it hurt to be dead?
animal.
what?
can I tell?
you want to die?
your beer-addled sperm still works.
you impregnated my sister again.
I thought you wanted me to.
what?
the kid could have been born before he noticed.
you're not pregnant.
congratulations is more appropriate...
and you told her before me?-She's a witch. She took one look at me and guessed.
say something?
bummer.
something else?
so. Six weeks... the baby's due in April, May, June, that's cool. Einstein was a Gemini.
so's that Scottish gal.
will you go help Jake with his pajamas?
but if she's late...
you start with that, I'm going throw you out a fucking window.
go upstairs and help him with the pajamas.
I love you, too.
Hey, this is great.
I think it's time we had another kid. I was going to bring it up myself.
Really?
you gotta take time off.
we can't afford it.
I'll do overtime. -I don't want you to work those hours. You come home and you're in a trance.
I'm going to do fine.
Teddy will get someone else.
Oh, Tom. I'm sorry.
I forgot. No wonder you're pissed off.
I'm not pissed off.
I'm not. I'm a grown man.
I shouldn't be screwing around with some shitty band anyway.
I gotta go change. Put on something cool.
I love you.
I'm a happy guy.
I'm not going to be a lineman forever. I promise you.
what do you mean?
I clip wire all day. A monkey could do it.
you'll move to the office.
by the end of the year...
no, I meant...l said a lot about where I was going to go and be.
I wanted you to know I wasn't giving you a line. That I meant it.
I didn't marry you...because I thought you would be famous.
I liked the way your ass looked in jeans.
I never wanted to be famous. I just didn't expect to be so...
what?
ordinary.
Shh...
I hope it's a girl. I'm sick of all these balls here.
except for yours.
what are the odds of an educated single man being at this thing?
what if he's on the boner pill?
I wouldn't look a gift boner in the mouth.
Hey, Tommy.
you would not believe the day I had.
here take this. Come on.
Hey, Harry.
taking care of the place for me?
we're drilling holes in the floors.
you know Sheila, Bobby, Vanessa.
their pumpkin. Take the medicine into your body.
Tom, you like the neighborhood?
I grew up in Bridgeport. It's not a foreign country.
damn right it isn't. This is the best neighborhood in the city of Chicago. Because we look out for each other.
are you running for mayor?
anybody see them crank dealers hanging around?
what's Lenny doing here?
Bobby. Did you tell him?
Vanessa made me.
I could see if he heard the noise and wandered in...
...but to actually invite this jack off.
when you wake up dead with your throat cut, don't come to me.
not attracted to...
not drunk enough for...
frightened by...
haven't you heard of people being operated on while under hypnosis?
but I don't believe it.
people who say they were hypnotized were just playing along.
then how could they have a scalpel stuck in their throat...without bleeding without even making a sound?
bullshit. -You never saw that.
bullshit.
learn another word.
Yes. Narrow-minded. I saw a guy in my class get a two-inch needle stuck into his arm while he was under hypnosis.
you're making it up.
I saw the picture. It left a mark.
I don't see how a person who's spent most of her adult life in college can believe in that superstition.
it's not. I'm practically a licensed hypnotherapist.
practically licensed?
lsn't that like saying I don't have a license? Ow.
because you kicked around the same six blocks all your life doesn't mean there isn't a larger world.
doorways you haven't even opened. Things you don't have the faintest understanding of.
okay, Kreskin. Prove it. Hypnotize somebody.
Yeah. Do me.
no.
why not?
for one, you're hostile.
do I seem hostile?
thanks for having us. Great party.
come on, Lisa. Hypnotize me.
come on.
you're drunk.
I'm not drunk.
you shouldn't mesmerize anyone who's drinking.
Mesmerize? Stop. Please, come on.
I'm begging you. Educate the savages.
it won't work with that uncooperative attitude.
I will follow every instruction to the letter.
what can happen?
turn out the lights.
just relax. Put your arm down, rest it comfortably.
lean back.
be very comfortable. Relax.
trust me, okay?
close your eyes.
certainly, Lisa.
now, just listen for a moment.
listen to the sounds of the room around you.
I want you to pretend you're in a theater.
a movie theater,
you're the only one there.
it's a great old movie palace.
you look around.
it's a huge empty theater.
the walls of the theater are...painted in black.
the seats...are covered in black.
and in the whole pitch-black theater...
...there's only one thing you can see. The white screen.
you notice there are letters on the screen.
tall, thick, black letters. They're out of focus.
you drift closer to them in your chair, trying to read them.
you're very comfortable. It's your favorite chair.
and you're drifting closer and closer. Staring at the letters.
very relaxed, your legs are relaxed. Your arms are limp and heavy.
you're almost close enough to read the letters.
they start to come into focus. The letters spell...sleep.
sleep.
what the hell was that?
what?
are you okay?
you had to be faking it.
that was the weirdest thing I've ever seen.
you're one of the lucky 8 percent.
you still have tears on your cheeks.
what the hell did she do to me?
what 8 percent?
only 8 percent of the population...that's highly hypnotization. Anybody can go under a little...
...but not way under, not freaky-under like he did.
how's your hand?
what?
I stuck a safety pin in your hand and asked you to bleed on one side, but not the other.
which you did.
you were very cooperative.
that happened?
you said it didn't hurt.
I want to know more about Joey Luca.
who?
the kid who pounded the shit out of you when you were 12.
you were crying and moaning.
it was hysterical. It was very moving.
Joey Luca? I haven't thought about him...
can we go home? I feel strange.
Yeah, sure.
close your eyes.
what's the matter?
stop
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Oh my God!
what?
I'm seeing things.
what do you mean?
no. no. wait. I can't right now.
then you were faking it very well.
wait. Stop. Stop. It's too weird.
baby. That wasn't weird. I could show you weird.
I felt like I was being attacked.
Thanks.
no. I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.
hey Jake.
you're awake.
you okay?
I guess.
I don't feel good.
don't be afraid of it.
what was it? A hallucination?
a lot of them. It's hard to explain. These thoughts kept coming.
you believe this, seven calls.
it was the hypnosis. Your brain was agitated.
I had this headache. I was thirsty as hell.
Jake. You're not watching that monster tape.
who was the woman?
maybe somebody I met once. She didn't look familiar.
did you fuck her?
you gotta be kidding.
was she someone you used to date?
you're jealous of my hallucination? You are pregnant.
call Lisa -She already fucked up my brain.
then she has to unfuck it.
fuck.
don't swear so much.
let me get my bearings. I have no caffeine in my system?
you're asking me if I gave you a...
posthypnotic suggestion. Did you leave anything inside my brain?
nothing.
don't lie...
this is insulting. I have done this before.
okay. Good. I was just making sure.
it was harmless.
what?
did it actually work?
what did you say?
I don't want to tell. You're grouchy.
Lisa.
I've always said you need to be more openminded, right?
yeah?
I just said after you wake up, your mind will be completely open.
like an open door, open to receive everything around you.
what's that do?
I don't know, why? Did something happen?
Jesus Christ.
relax. I opened a door. Therapists do it all the time.
it releases repressed memories, latent abilities. Whatever.
it was probably reruns for you.
I gotta get back to work.
okay. Alright then.
no more calls.
hey Lis. It's me.
could you babysit for...us on Friday night?
I did. I told him.
what's her name? Okay.
I'd ask grandma. But I'd have to hear it for months. No one's...free.
call Vanessa.
huh?
call Vanessa and ask her about Debbie.
call me back. Bye. Debbie? That's who babysits for them?
Yep.
great idea. Pray she's free. How'd you know about Debbie?
Samantha told me.
hey Vanessa. Are you going out Friday night?
Hi. I'm Debbie.
Kozak.
Tom Witzky.
hi Debbie. -Hi.
I'm Maggie. Thanks for coming. Jake's asleep. Never wakes up.
you shouldn't have any trouble with him.
his room's upstairs. Kitchen. Help yourself...
...if you want. Have a seat.
baby monitor.
it's on B in his room.
you'll hear everything. A movie? -Got a book.
won't be later than midnight. If that's okay. -Perfect.
just grap... ...my coat and we're outta here. Hello?
ready?
just about. -Okay.
Where'd you find that girl?
Vanessa gave me her number. Everybody uses her, it's cool.
another headache?
too much caffeine.
Oh. Okay. Let's go.
Bye.
Damon is doing a great job.
the kid's got an arm, but high school football is about...power, running...the ball.
was for me.
What'd you play?
piano mostly.
Oh Jesus. Sorry. Here, you want some?
I admit I am biased, but... my kid's season is great...
...and nobody cares. If he got the ball, he'd break a thousand yards.
and that's short season. Jesus
why don't you just lick them when they walk by?
Frank says a guy carries a hardon 2 and a half hours a day.
three and a half for him
now I have to picture that.
one day she's gonna find one of my 38s and pop a cap in my ass.
he'll stick it in a bowl of soup if it's still warm.
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
he does 1000 yards. We're talking major scholarships.
kid could write his own ticket.
it's good for everyone, the whole neighborhood.
he's gonna go a lot farther than I ever did.
look at the tail he's getting.
he passed me when he was 14.
come on! While we're young. Huh?
you scared me.
she's downstairs, I think.
I don't know. I haven't seen her yet.
Jake?
what's the matter?
something's wrong. -What?
Samantha says it's always dark where she is.
who did you say?
Samantha.
you talked to Samantha?
Yeah.
when?
all the time.
where?
here in my house.
that's not true.
that isn't true.
I don't tell lies.
Samantha was here? -You're hurting me.
was she here? -Let go of me!
you're coming with me.
she's taking him away.
put me down! Put me down!
Jake, Jake!
what the hell?
she took him. -What?
the babysitter took him somewhere. He's not in there.
where are you going? -I don't know!
he's in there.
Jake. -Daddy!
that's him -Where are you going?
stop, stop, stop.
where is she?
you tell me where she is!
where is she?
quiet!
you okay?
that girl...kidnapped our son.
is that your child?
Samantha -This boy. Does he belong to you?
I can explain.
I'm talking to her.
is he yours?
no.
she was babysitting for us.
you can go to jail for this.
where were you going?
nowhere!
why'd you bring him here?
press charges.
I work here. I'm her mother.
when are you...gonna ask them about Samantha?
who? -My daughter. She ran away
she was kidnapped. The boy said he saw her.
we filed a police report. There's an investigation.
Jake talk to her all the time. In his house!
is that her?
let go!
look at the picture.
this is ridiculous!
look at the picture.
I've never seen her before.
what about you?
I've never seen her.
they're lying!
charges?
Yes. -No.
what?
come on. Let's just forget about it.
let's go home.
what about the next people she babysits for? -lt was her?
who?
that girl in the picture is the one I saw on our couch.
why did you ask Debbie to babysit for us?
I couldn't find anybody. I was on the phone and Jake said.
do you remember when we were talking in the kitchen?
I was looking for a babysitter. Remember?
you said Samantha told you about Debbie. Remember?
mommy's asking you a question.
is Samantha someone who talks to you?
can you remember
don't ask the boy any more questions.
talk to me.
what did you say? -Huh?
what did you say?
nothing.
let me hear that voice again.
say it again. Use that voice again.
come on Jake. Use that voice again.
I know you can do it. I wanna hear. -Don't do that.
okay.
let's see if Beetleborg's on.
Hey! I'm talking to him.
what's the matter?
what do you think?
I'm trying to talk with my kid.
perfectly normal talk for a five year old.
don't be afraid of it. -Why shouldn't l?
that's what he told me. This is where I saw her. Sitting here.
I grabbed the remote, leaned back and there she was.-You should see yourself right now.
Maggie please!
maybe you don't see her? You just hear her. -You're scaring him.
I need to make her come back. If I stay here long enough, she'll come back. You could talk to her.
help me. What's wrong?
knock it off!
I don't want to talk about this. It scares Mommy.
turn it up, -What?
turn it up.
Tom is looking especially together today.
he grunted a very pleasant greeting at me.
becoming monosyllabic. Nothing wrong with him.
nothing a little lithium couldn't cure.
I'm a jerk. I'm sorry.
are you okay?
on the base room and board are covered and you got pay.
still gotta get up early.
I've got enough for a couple of down payments.
I'm a landlord already. Five years later I got three houses.
Harry.
how you doing?
what do you know about Samantha Kozak?
Samantha Kozak? That's familiar.
brownish hair. Seventeen. Used to live around here.
Yeah. I remember.
can we go? -Kurt!
come here. Like he ever...tells me anything.
get over here!
do you know that Kozak girl?
Debbie.
no, Samantha.
you mean the retard? She ran away.
that's right. I remember. What about her?
I've been thinking about her.
Why?
her sister babysat for us.
Oh.
first time he's been out in a week. Hasn't gone to work.
he's used up all his sick days.
if he doesn't show up they'll dock him.
I can't get him off the couch.
Why? -That's where she appeared.
I'm not shocked that there's another woman. Of course she's dead.
we're talking about a ghost. Aren't we?
she left last March with a black guy.
did she live in our house?
no. You're the first tenants.
Tom and Jake have this private club or something.
they sit and whisper and when I walk in the room. They shut up.
know what you need to do?
find a young, cute priest who can guide you through this.
I'm kidding. But I'm not.
the truth is you guys are the best couple. On earth. This on you now. Maggie.
get some help. Find out why this is happening. There's a reason.
you won't be the first who's had to hold a crazy family together.
Tom's not crazy.
yes he is. At least he's getting interesting.
sports flash.
211 yards rushing last night. Total of...894 yards with two games left. He needs 106 yards. That's 53 a game.
he could walk and still beat 1000.
do you know her?
who?
Tom was asking about that Kozak girl.
the one who ran away.
the retard.
don't use that word.
she was slow.
what? Retard?
shut your fucking... mouth before I shut if for you.
somebody's always gotta ruin it. It can't ever be just nice.
went to park with Jake. M.
what are you doing here?
they're gonna kill you. Tommy.
you and Maggie both.
why would you say that?
this is a decent neighborhood.
Hey, are you okay?
Where's Sheila? She at home?
I'm gonna see if Sheila's home. Okay?
get in the house! Right now!
come in!
hi -Hi,
your mom home? Your dad's acting...
wanna see what I've got?
sure.
is that your dad's?
not today. Come here.
put the gun away. Adam.
come here.
those things make me nervous.
I'll make you nervous.
whoa, don't!
don't!
please don't be under there.
Oh boy.
Frank.
get in the house right now!
Adam. Open the door!
Oh God.
help!
am I awake? Or asleep? Help!
my baby!
Oh my God?
is he alive?
Oh my God!
Adam!
I'm gonna take him for a walk.
come on sweetheart. -Where we going?
hello.
hello.
listen! Music! It's beautiful!
Jake! Wait.
we're not supposed to be here.
this is cool!
let's go get lunch.
mom, what's this?
let me take a look.
it looks like a stone.
or a medal.
Yeah. Look. A flag.
everything okay?
just fine.
should we leave?
no. it's fine. Really.
okay. See you later.
he's got the eyes.
xray.
not you. Though.
the dad? They're not alone.
tell him to come and see me later.
might learn a few things.
bye Jake.
bye Neil.
his name is Neil.
try that, Daddy.
why do I know that?
we have a payload to deliver to the heart of our nearest star.
we're doing it because that star is dying.
and if it dies, we die.
everything dies.
so that is our mission. There is nothing...
literally nothing, more important than completing our mission. End of story.
he's right. He's right. Of course I'm right.
is anyone here seriously considering otherwise?
may I put a counter argument? No.
captain?
go ahead.
it would, of course...
...be absurd to alter our trajectory to assist the crew of the Icarus I.
even if we knew that some or even all of that crew are still alive...
...their lives are expendable when seen in the context of our mission.
as are our own lives.
exactly. However...
...there is something onboard the Icarus I that may be worth the detour.
as you pointed out, Mace, we have a payload to deliver.
a payload. Singular.
now, everything about the delivery and effectiveness of that payload...
...is entirely theoretical.
simply put...
...we don't know if it's gonna work.
but what we do know is this...
...if we had two bombs, we'd have two chances.
you're assuming we'd be able to pilot Icarus I.
Yes. Which is assuming...
...that whatever stopped them wasn't a fault or a damage to the spacecraft.
Yes. It's a lot of assumptions.
it is.
it's a risk assessment.
the question is:
does the risk of a detour outweigh the benefits of an extra payload?
we'll have a vote. No, no.
no, we won't.
we are not a democracy.
we're a collection of astronauts and scientists.
so we're gonna make the most informed decision available to us.
made by you, by any chance?
made by the person best qualified to understand the complexities of a payload delivery.
our physicist.
shit.
okay, Icarus, run the math on the successful delivery of the payload.
okay, payload delivery point reached.
detach the payload.
stellar bomb initiated and detached.
crew and living section have four minutes...
...to clear and commence homeward journey.
and four minutes after separation, boosters automatically fire.
payload boosters will automatically fire after four-minute delay.
entering coronal hole in South Polar Cap.
magnetic field structure open.
temperature, 37, 000.
reliability of projection has dropped below 45 percent.
remaining projection is not open to useful speculation.
variables infinite.
accuracy unknown.
that's the problem right there.
between the boosters and the gravity of the sun...
...the velocity will be so great...
...space and time will become smeared together.
everything will distort, everything will be unquantifiable.
you have to come down on one side or the other.
I need a decision. It's not a decision, it's a guess.
it's like flipping a coin and asking me to decide whether it'll be heads or tails.
And?
heads.
we've mined all Earth's fissile materials for this bomb.
there's not gonna be another payload.
the one we carry is our last chance.
our last best hope.
Searle's argument is sound.
two last hopes are better than one.
that's it.
slingshot complete.
Icarus leaving Mercury orbit.
Hey.
Hey.
good dream?
let me guess.
the surface of the sun?
only dream I ever have.
every time I shut my eyes it's always the same.
maybe you should talk to Dr. Searle about that.
see if he can help you out.
maybe.
I just wanted to let you know...
...I think you made the right decision.
well.
mace doesn't and I'm guessing Harvey and Trey don't either.
yeah...
...but I do.
get the alarm. What's going on? I screwed up.
it's not you. It's my responsibility.
we shouldn't be straying. Trey, cut to it.
in order to change the route, I had to manually override Icarus.
so I made all the calculations myself.
and I double- and triple-checked them.
they all worked out.
so I set the new coordinates and put us on our way.
what's the problem? The trajectory is wrong?
the trajectory is good.
but it changes our angle of approach to the sun by 1.1 degrees.
you didn't reset the shields to the new angle.
Jesus christ, Trey.
I forgot.
my head was full of velocities and fuel calculations and a million different...
I fucked up, all right?
people do shit.
they get stressed...
...and fuck up.
I fucked up.
Trey.
the fact is, we're still alive.
a hole hasn't burnt in the side of the ship.
we don't have a 10, 000-degree climate.
so, what's the actual damage? We don't know.
Icarus tried to reset the shields independently when the alarm triggered.
but all the sensors up there are burned out.
so we have no idea of the state of the affected area.
only way we're gonna know is if we go out there.
okay.
I'll get suited up.
it's a two-man job.
as second in command, you're not going anywhere.
I volunteer. No, I volunteer.
fine.
I volunteer Capa.
sure.
I'll do it.
okay.
okay.
you've done this a thousand times in Earth-orbit training.
Yeah.
you're gonna be fine.
okay?
okay, Icarus.
I'm gonna be taking control for a while.
okay, Cassie. I'm gonna be cutting speed.
I'm gonna rotate us so the damage is facing away from the sun.
do we understand each other? - Yes, Cassie.
rotate by that much, we're gonna lose communication towers three and four.
well, it's a good thing we don't need them, then.
we don't need them now, we're gonna need them to go home.
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
in the meantime, I'm gonna try and give them as much shadow as I can.
all right, guys.
I'm opening up.
okay.
helmet-cam operational.
affirmative. Good image.
capa, check, helmet-cam fully operational.
affirmative.
exiting airlock with maintenance modules.
moving down to investigate damaged area.
okay, guys.
nice and easy.
nice and easy.
copy.
Icarus, please adjust shield to allow for rotation.
Yes, Cassie.
establishing new alignment to sun.
Jesus.
that's the temperature change on the shields.
the metal's just contracting and expanding.
I know what it is, flyboy.
it sounds like she's tearing apart.
fatal damage to Communications Towers 3 and 4.
copy, Icarus. Loss of towers 3 and 4. Cancel alarm.
shut down sensor to communications Tower 3 and 4.
you should see it up here, guys.
it's pretty impressive.
okay.
there are four damaged panels.
they're about 300 meters out.
capa, take it easy. You're going through your O2 pretty fast.
copy that, Cory.
that's it. Slow down the breathing.
relaxed movement.
approaching the first panel.
we were lucky.
can you guys see this?
we can see it.
the hydraulics are burnt out.
let's get this closed.
okay, Mace.
that's it.
that's the first one closed.
you can do it?
it'll take a while, but...
Yeah.
we can do it.
great job.
lots of smiling faces in this room, guys.
great job. - I love you, captain.
moving to next panel.
three to go.
Hey.
don't kill yourself, man. We got this, okay?
what's going on, guys?
the ship's moving.
we're venting O2. Shit.
I think we're venting O2.
resuming computer control of Icarus II.
negative, Icarus. Manual control.
negative, Cassie. Computer control.
returning vessel to original rotation. - What?
Icarus, override computer to manual control.
negative. Mission in jeopardy.
override command statement to manual flight controls removed.
Why? - Negative, Icarus.
negative. State reason immediately.
fire in oxygen garden.
no.
seal oxygen feed.
fireguard perimeter.
sealing sector. Sealing feed.
seal sections five through nine. - Sealing five through nine.
Kaneda, capa, get back to the airlock now.
can't.
can't leave upright panels.
the ship will burn up if the shields are not repaired.
they're gonna die. - Don't.
they're gonna burn. - They are not.
override Icarus. Cassie, pilot...
...emergency command 0-0-0.

second human confirmation required. - Copy.
Mace?
Mace?
wait, cassie.
Jesus christ, Harvey.
Harvey, communications officer, confirm back-up 0-0-0.
override command confirmed.
manual control returned.
no.
Icarus, continue procedure.
what?
captain.
back me up. Copy, Mace.
crew priority is to protect the payload.
get the fire out.
Icarus, take control of the ship.
affirmative, captain. Damn it.
returning vessel to original rotation.
let me in. Please. Negative.

you motherfucker.
let me in.
hazard diagnostic complete.
sprinkler system failing.
fire will burn for six hours.
sixty percent chance of containment failure.
seventy-five percent chance of collateral damage to life-support systems.
what are we gonna do?
flood it with O2. What?
it'll cause a flashover. Make it burn itself out.
we'll lose the whole garden.
we already lost it.
Jesus, Mace, I don't know.
Icarus, open the O2 tanks.
cory, get the hell out of there.
opening O2 tanks.
no.
eighty-nine percent of shield in full sunlight.
capa, go back.
I'll finish this.
please, I can do this.
go.
capa returning to airlock.
do you copy?
capa returning to airlock. Do you copy?
copy, Capa. Hurry.
ninety-one percent of shield in full sunlight.
ninety-four percent of shield in full sunlight.
captain? Captain? I'm at the edge of the shield.
do you copy?
captain, you must leave now. Captain?
ninety-seven percent of shield in full sunlight.
final panel closing. The shield is secure.
you have to move now.
captain, it's right on you.
Kaneda's not gonna make it. You have to move.
you have to move now.
it's too far.
captain, move.
why isn't he moving?
Kaneda.
what do you see?
searle, tell our captain to move.
Kaneda, what can you see?
searle, do you copy?
Kaneda?
shield rotation complete.
the breakdown is as follows.
Trey is sedated in the Med centre.
Dr. Searle has diagnosed him as a suicide risk.
I don't think any of us are about to question that diagnosis.
as second in command,
I am now the captain of Icarus II.
thanks both to Kaneda...
...and capa, our shields are intact.
as is the payload.
but the oxygen garden is totally destroyed.
in addition, a large amount of O2 was burned in the fire.
as it stands now...
...we don't have enough oxygen reserves to get us to our payload delivery point.
let alone to survive the return journey.
so cancel the ticker-tape parade.
we now have no choice but to rendezvous with Icarus I.
if we're gonna complete the mission...
...the Icarus I is our only hope.
technically, he made a mistake.
what are you trying to say, Cory?
Harvey said there's not enough oxygen to get us to the delivery point.
but there is.
there just isn't enough oxygen to get all of us there.
are you suggesting we let Trey kill himself?
no.
and in any case...
...Trey wouldn't be enough.
we need to lose two more.
three out of seven. That's a lot of short straws.
capa, it's me.
it's different. Being afraid that you won't make it back home. And then knowing that you won't.
our survival depends on what we can salvage from Icarus I.
no.
we're gonna die out here.
like the other crew.
I know it.
so do you.
are you scared?
when the stellar bomb is triggered...
...very little will happen at first.
and then a spark will pop into existence...
...and it will hang for an instant, hovering in space. And then...
...it will split into two.
and those will split again...
...and again and again.
detonation beyond all imagining.
a big bang on a small scale.
a new star born out of a dying one.
I think it'll be beautiful.
no. I'm not scared.
I am.
searle, Capa, they're waiting for you.
okay, let's go.
be careful, watch your step.
Cassie, are you getting this on the feed?
getting what?
the air. It's full of dust.
human skin.
what?
eighty percent of all dust is human skin.
sorry.
no lights? No.
no surprise.
anyone afraid of the dark?
we should split up.
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
Yeah, probably right.
might get picked off one at a time by aliens.
Icarus I is a big ship.
we can't search it effectively in one group.
okay. You're right.
mace, head up for the Flight Deck, see if you can't get her to fly.
searle, check the social area and the sleeping quarters.
capa, aim for the payload.
I'll check the garden.
let's keep in contact, guys.
listen up, everybody.
you gotta see this. Seven years of unchecked growth.
can you see this?
it's an ecosystem working beautifully after all this time.
you seeing this readout, O2, everybody.
it's wonderful.
Oh, my God.
cory, look at the ferns.
that's strange.
subsystems are fine. Solar harvest is fine.
the ship should be running except I'm getting nothing from the flight computer.
got water.
food.
no crew.
no bodies.
my God.
you can hardly walk, it's so thick.
I am Pinbacker.
commander of the Icarus I.
we have abandoned our mission.
our star is dying.
all our science...
...all our hopes...
...our dreams, are foolish.
in the face of this...
...we are...
...dust. Nothing more.
and to this dust, we will return.
when he chooses for us to die.
it is not our place...
...to challenge God.
okay, that make sense to anyone?
transmission code is six and a half years ago.
that would be after they entered the non-communication zone.
that should be the time they were supposed to deliver the payload.
payload is fully operational.
say again, Capa?
the payload is fully operational. It's okay.
that's great news. Looks like we got what we came for.
no, we don't.
go ahead, Mace?
I know what caused the distress signal.
there's a coolant failure of some kind. The bottom line is...
...it doesn't matter that Capa has his payload.
without the mainframe, we can't fly.
it's been sabotaged.
we should never have gone off the mission.
I have something to say.
found the crew.
what happened?
they had an epiphany.
they saw the light.
they burned themselves.
no shit.
I suspect the observation filter is fully open.
if we weren't behind the screen of Icarus II, we'd join them.
ashes to ashes.
Stardust to stardust.
icarus!
Icarus. Stabilizers.
what was that? Guys, get back to the airlock, now.
we have a major incident.
we are floating free from you.
repeat, we are floating free.
all crew back to the airlock.
Cassie. The airlock has decoupled.
we don't know why.
the locking system on Icarus I is totally ripped open.
I can hold our position but we aren't gonna be able to dock again.
there's another thing, guys.
you've got a breach, I can see it. You're losing atmosphere.
we're screwed.
no, we're not.
one of us isn't, anyway.
what happened?
airlock's destroyed. There's only one suit. Capa's taking it.
why Capa? The rest of us are lower priority.
I'm not a low priority.
you're a communications officer on a ship that has no communication.
I am the captain.
the mission needs a captain to hold it together.
Harvey, Capa's the only person outside of Icarus who can operate the payload.
there is no choice.
no, there's no choice for you.
capa, I order you to remove that suit.
get out of the suit.
that is a direct order.
I assure you, when I'm onboard Icarus II that I'll do everything within my power...
to what? Shuttle back with more suits?
the airlock is ripped in half.
once we break that seal, how are we gonna re-pressurize?
Cassie.
go.
listen. We can't depressurize when we open the airlock.
so the force of the gas is gonna fire him out, right?
right.
if you open your airlock and we line it up right, he'll fire inside.
and so will we.
without suits?
get as close as you can. You'll have 20 meters to cover.
at minus 273 degrees celsius.
it's gonna be cold.
but we'll make it.
anyone got any better ideas?
copy that.
mace.
one problem.
the computer's down.
one of us has to manually operate the seal.
from inside.
shit.
you're right.
so, whatever happens, one of us is staying behind.
I see. I get it.
it's me. That's what you're all thinking?
no, Harvey.
it's me.
you okay?
Hey, Capa.
we're only stardust.
mace, we're lined up.
everything's set.
searle, are you ready?
all right. We only got one shot at this.
Cassie.
are you ready? Ready.
Harvey, keep your eyes shut and exhale slowly.
copy.
let's do it.
crew detected in airlock.
recommend sealing outer airlock door.
I lost Harvey. I lost Harvey.
Harvey's gone. Crew detected in airlock.
sealing outer airlock door.
breathe, Mace. Just breathe.
get my hand. Get my hand.
breathe, Mace. Capa?
you're okay, Mace. You're okay, Mace. Please, breathe.
capa, are you all right? Yeah. Yeah.
let's get you out of here.
searle?
we're leaving now.
we're gonna complete the mission.
we're all thinking of you, Searle.
searle?
we're gonna go now.
we love you.
I've been through Icarus's activity file and I checked it.
double-checked it. Cory triple-checked it.
and it's the same results.
in other words, unless Icarus is deleting her own files, she didn't do it.
and there was no malfunction on the airlock hardware.
which means the airlock was decoupled manually.
Cassie and I were on the Flight Deck.
and I was with Capa and Searle.
and I think we can all assume it wasn't Harvey.
which leaves one possibility.
Trey.
Trey is so doped up he can hardly walk or feed himself.
he sleeps for 23 hours a day. And he blames himself for everything.
why would he do it? We don't know.
the possibility remains that it was him and we gotta take that seriously.
by doping him up more?
this isn't just about the possibility whether he sabotaged the airlock.
there is something else too.
when Searle and Harvey died, we lost two breathers.
if Trey dies...
...We'll have the oxygen to make it to the delivery point.
at least now we know what happened on Icarus I.
the same thing that's happening here. - Fuck you, Capa.
what are you trying to remind us of? Our lost humanity?
I'll do it.
I'm not passing any bucks.
do it how?
that's between me and Trey.
we'll have a vote this time. Unanimous decision required.
so you know where I stand.
and me.
what are you asking?
that we weigh the life of one against the future of mankind?
kill him.
Cassie?
no.
Cassie. I know the argument.
I know the logic.
you're saying you need my vote.
I'm saying you can't have it.
what do we do?
Oh, God.
I'm sorry, Cassie.
you make it easy for him.
somehow.
find a kindness.
Trey.
everybody got here now.
he cut his wrists.
he took responsibility.
all these deaths.
Kaneda.
Searle. Harvey.
Trey.
none of them would have happened if you hadn't diverted the mission.
what do you want me to say?
I don't want you to say shit.
I just want you to know that this...
...belongs here.
fuck you.
air is low. We need to limit our exertions.
Icarus? Yes, Capa?
run an update on biometric signs for all crew.
check oxygen consumption.
checking.
thank you.
Capa.
yes? You are dying.
all crew are dying.
we know we're dying.
as long as we can live long enough to deliver the payload...
...we're okay with it.
capa, warning.
you will not live long enough to deliver the payload.
please clarify.
twelve hours before crew will be unable to perform complex tasks.
fourteen hours before crew will be unable to perform basic tasks.
sixteen hours until death.

nineteen hours. Impossible. Corazon was certain.
we have remaining oxygen to keep four crew alive.
affirmative. Four crew could survive on current reserves...
Trey is dead. There are only four crew members.
negative.
affirmative, Icarus. Four crew: Mace, Cassie, Corazon and me.
five crew members.
Icarus?
yes?
who's the fifth crew member?
unknown.
where is the fifth crew member?
in the Observation Room.
are you an angel?
has the time come?
I've been waiting so long.
who are you?
who am I?
at the end of time...
...a moment will come when just one man remains.
then the moment will pass.
the man will be gone.
there will be nothing to show as if we were ever here but stardust.
the last man, alone with God.
am I that man?
my God.
my God, Pinbacker?
not your God.
mine.
Icarus. Full sunlight.
anyone.
Oh, my God.
Icarus?
warning, you do not have authority to remove...
...the mainframe panels from the coolant.
please return the panels to the coolant.
I cannot locate your biometric signs.
please identify yourself.
you gotta be kidding.
my God.
a baby.
a beautiful baby.
Icarus, patch me through to Mace. I have something wonderful to show him.
or Cassie or Capa.
Icarus?
don't fight.
don't fight.
Mace?
Capa?
is anyone else getting silence from Icarus?
anybody?
Capa?
Icarus, why are we in orbit?
respond.
what?
Jesus Christ.
Capa? Capa?
in the suit.
use the hard link.
in the helmet.
Mace?
what the hell is going on? Mace?
I can't talk to Icarus.
Pinbacker is onboard. He's trying to stop the mission.
he's trying to destroy the mission. He's insane.
mace, listen. I'm locked in the airlock.
Jesus christ. The mainframe is out of the coolant.
the mechanism is disabled.
I can't lower the mainframe panels.
mace, repeat, please.
Icarus is gonna burn out.
mace.
mace, come in.
come on.
Capa.
Capa. Mace?
we're in orbit. The computer is down.
I don't know if I can get her back online.
you have to break us out of orbit manually.
the only way to do that...
...is separate the payload. Do you get it, Capa?
force the bomb into the sun.
separate the payload.
you'll have to get to the bomb and detonate manually.
unlock the airlock, do you copy? Unlock the airlock.
I don't know how, just do it. Just do it.
okay.
I'm gonna do this.
copy, Mace.
copy.
Capa.
my leg.
Oh, God.
do it, Capa.
do it.
mace.
come on.
only dream I ever have.
is it the surface of the sun?
every time I shut my eyes it's always the same.
Cassie?
Cassie?
we're flying into the sun.
Cassie, there's not much time. I need to know.
where is he? Is he here?
for seven years I spoke with God.
he told me to take us all to heaven.
no.
finish it.
let's say 25. Set at 25.
please.
please.
Hi, sister.
kiss the kids.
you guys, come on.
it's time.
so if you wake up one morning...
...and it's a particularly beautiful day, you'll know we made it.
okay.
I'm signing out.
listen, I might be back.
you'll be back.
your daughter will think you're the best dad in the world.
my sister has two and loves them. - Good.
come, let's fix the collar.
there you are.
it's amazing how real this is. - I know.
my daughter will be so excited.
come, let's go home.
you have called Hank Morgan.
Hi, I'm not here, so leave a message.
Hank, it's me again.
what happened to you? I waited at Kelly's for half an hour. It's now...
...five past 7. - I'm Sim-Pal Cindy. What's your name?
I'm heading home now. If you get this message...
let's be friends.
what's your name?
can't you see I'm talking? Quiet.
head to my house with flowers and a good excuse, or Natalie will kill you.
I can sing songs. Would you like to sing with me?
excuse me, do you know how to turn this off?
my niece has one. Say, "Go to sleep, Cindy.
go to sleep, Cindy. - Would you like to sing...
go to sleep.
thank you. Thanks for the ride.
good night.
clara, sweetie, honey.
Oliver was very sick and he had to be put down.
clara, sweetie, honey. Oliver had to go to heaven.
why, Daddy?
well, you see, because...
...It's because, uh...
shit, Oliver! Why'd you have to die?
Oliver?
Natalie.
one...
...two, three!
that's amazing. Look at this cake!
Oh, my God.
Adam Gibson?
who are you?
we have a situation. Come with us, please.
what the hell is going on?
cooperate and everything will be fine.
fine? Someone's in my house, eating my birthday cake and it's not me!
we know. There's been a 6th Day violation. A human was cloned.
that human was you. - We can help.
then get him out! - But you'll have to come with us.
I don't know who the hell you people are...
...but I'm going in my house. - Right.
Oops. Cindy fell down.
get the doll.
not here.
I'm Sim-Pal Cindy. What's your name?
I can play games.
shit.
wiley, no! Hold your fire!
that way! Go!
Vincent, go!
I have a boo-boo.
stop the car!
stop the car!
thanks for the suggestion!
don't even blink.
Oh, God. Someone stole the minivan.
no, they stole my Cadillac.
Oh, no.
car chase. Cool.
who are you? - I was hired to kill you.
that's all I know.
I'm Sim-Pal Cindy. What's your name?
secure child-seat restraint.
let's be friends.
where is this guy? - I'm Sim-Pal Cindy.
let's be friends.
what's your name?
will you be my mommy?
I don't want to be your mommy!
shut up! - What?
somebody do something about that doll!
I have a boo-boo.
this is crazy. Why does anyone want to kill me?
he got home first.
you saw him, he didn't see you. You're screwed.
he's going to live your boring life and never be the wiser.
your wife and kid see you two together, they'll be killed.
goddamn it, Wiley!
son of a bitch.
stupid!
blow out his tires this time!
shit!
that was spectacular.
son of a bitch.
hold my belt.
okay.
you got me?
little more.
get some people to look for this guy!
pick up Wiley and Talia's bodies and get them to the lab.
I'm Dr. Griffin Weir. Welcome to the new Weir Organ Transplant Facility.
thanks for visiting Replacement Technologies.
doctor, protesters claim that cloning human organs...
...will lead to cloning whole humans.
that's not only illegal, we're years from the technology to do it.
a human was cloned over 10 years ago.
and we know the outcome of that bizarre experiment.
if you recall, the Supreme Court ordered the clone be destroyed...
...and I think that was the humane thing to do.
it led to laws against human cloning...
...and set back the course of legitimate research by years.
Mr. Drucker! You gave...
this is Dr. Weir's night, okay?
is it true you want to get the 6th Day laws repealed?
Dr. Weir is interested in medicine, not politics.
Mr. Drucker, the protesters claim you run repet at a loss...
...to soften people up to human cloning.
you know, we shouldn't forget that not long ago...
...there were almost no more fish left in the ocean...
...and half the world's population faced the threat of hunger.
cloning technology turned that around.
extremists won't admit they'd rather people went hungry...
...than eat cloned fish, so they yell about human cloning.
do you think human cloning laws should be changed?
suppose a 10-year-old boy is in the hospital, dying of liver cancer.
thanks to Dr. Weir's work...
...we can save that boy.
in the next bed lies another 10-year-old boy...
...whose parents love him just as much...
...only he has an inoperable brain tumor.
you cannot clone a brain.
the only way to save him would be to clone the whole person.
how do you tell that boy's parents that we can save the first boy...
...but the research that would have saved their son wasn't done...
...because of a law passed by frightened politicians a decade ago?
so, what does that mean?
enjoy the party.
looks like you needed rescuing. - Yes, I did. Thank you.
Weir Clinic, stay away! No research on DNA!
Weir Clinic, stay away! No research on DNA!
Hey, boss!
Johnny. How's my star quarterback?
I'd say I felt like a million bucks, but I'd hate to take a pay cut.
don't remind me, all right?
that was one nasty hit you took last week.
be careful. We don't want you getting killed.
Katherine? Are you all right?
I'm just feeling like I don't quite belong.
but I'm fine. Really.
no, you're not.
should I call Dr. Stevens?
no, no, no. I just overdid it, that's all.
I'll get a car to take you home.
thank you.
Mr. Speaker? Thank you so much for coming. Champagne?
that was quite a speech. - You heard that?
sorry I got carried away.
your words meant a great deal to me.
as it happens, I have a son with an inoperable tumor of the brain.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, sir.
it must have been in my subconscious, knowing you were here.
no, no, it's all right.
gave me a lot to think about.
it gave me a different view of the subject.
Mr. Speaker...
...could I offer you a glass of brandy in my office upstairs?
I was 50 when Billy was born.
I didn't know if I wanted another kid so late.
but now I love him so damn much.
if there were something we could do for Billy...
...only it was highly illegal...
...would you consider it?
of course I would. That's the same hypothetical...
no, no. Don't answer so fast.
you'd face a minimum sentence of 40 years if it ever came out.
but he'd be cured?
he'd be exactly the same.
perfect health.
never even have to know.
but if the secret came out...
...with the law now...
...He'd be put to sleep like a rabid dog.
he'd be destroyed, like a horse with a broken leg.
and if it never came out?
or if the laws were changed one day?
Billy wouldn't have anything to worry about.
I beg you.
go to my house and pick up my wife and daughter.
if I go there, they'll kill them both.
you made a different report an hour ago.
no, I didn't.
according to this, you did.
that must have been the clone.
look, I know it sounds crazy.
I can hardly believe it myself.
was your car stolen or not? - Yes.
so you did report it? - No, I took it.
you stole your own car?
I'm a court-appointed virtual attorney. You don't have to answer.
is my client being charged with auto theft?
I didn't steal it! It's mine!
he claims it was filed by his clone.
I see. Loading virtual psychiatrist.
Mr. Gibson, what seems to be the trouble?
go through it now with him?
you're avoiding talking about your parents.
imagine: Two turtles are walking through the desert...
shut up!
what?
are you going to help me or not? - Of course we are.
medical alert transmitted. Awaiting data.
wait in here. I'll come get you as soon as we have news.
clones.
he saw himself at his house tonight.
which was our mistake, not his.
excuse me.
he's at precinct seven.
can you hurry Talia and Wiley along? I'll need them both.
goddamn it! Son of a bitch!
piece of shit Wiley. I'm gonna kill him. Where is he?
he's still cooking.
son of a bitch.
I look like crap.
do you have any idea how much my hair treatments cost?
how much does Gibson know?
that he's been cloned and we'll kill anyone who sees them together.
what's that? What?
does Drucker know you're talking about killing innocent people?
relax. It's just a threat.
of course, we'd never actually do it.
try to have a good night.
you do your hair. I'll take Wiley and Vincent.
I've got to pierce my damn ears again.
officials blame the latest strike by major league players...
...entering its 4th year and a lack of fan identification with teams in the Series for the dismal ratings.
shit.
Oh, no.
now what?
it feels tight all across here...
...where the tires ran over me.
you were run over by two cars and your chest was crushed.
exactly. I mean, no wonder, right?
it's in your mind.
completely crushed.
as in dead.
as in you have a totally new chest now.
then why is it hard to breathe?
tell you what.
why don't you just stay out here? Relax.
the fresh air will do you good.
state and government officials in Washington, D. C...
...are openly dismissive of the Microsoft proposal.
this amounts to an attempt by Microsoft to buy a state of the Union.
nothing in our Constitution or history...
...offers the remotest legal theory...
...By which a corporation can, in effect, own a state.
but if he goes off his medication, the paranoid delusions come back.
very sad. Because at other times, he seems almost rational.
Gibson!
Gibson!
you're dead. - No.
you're dead.
try to stay dead this time.
Hank, it's me again.
what happened to you?
I waited for half an hour at Kelly's.
it's now five past 7.
I'm heading home, okay?
he's fine. He's okay. He's our associate.
Gibson must have knocked him out.
knocked him out? He looks dead to me, doc.
no. Pulse is strong.
he'll be up and around in no time. We'll get him to the hospital.
easy.
let us know if you find Gibson.
honey, I'm home.
darling, where are you?
Hi, sugar.
Hello, my love.
have you been working out?
you look so good. - Thank you.
I recorded your sports programs.
maybe we can watch them together.
I'd like that.
or should I just take this off now?
no. Hold your horses.
Oh, Hank, I think it's so sexy when you go right to the chair.
I know you do.
you're gonna have to zip me up, sweetheart.
careful with the merchandise.
hold on, please!
have they been here? - Who?
Hello, Adam. Would you like a beer?
I'm sorry I missed the party, but...
...all of a sudden it's 11: 00 and I wound up at Kelly's.
you missed my party? - Not on purpose.
it was sort of weird. I feel terrible. I don't know what happened.
you feel terrible? I lost my wife, my daughter and my life tonight.
special dance.
Hank, listen.
I need your help.
not now, cupcake!
what going on? I don't understand.
that's a real gun.
what, what's going?
Jesus! What are you gonna do? Kill my cat?
what the hell is going on?
if you weren't at my party, then you didn't see him.
who's "him"?
Jesus H. Christ. I said get your dog cloned, not yourself.
what are you going to do?
take my life back.
you're going to kill him?
why not? He's not real. Plus, there's no law against it.
you're not serious.
I'm dead serious.
but look at him. He looks just like you.
technically, this could be committing suicide.
but he's not me.
he's not even human.
wait a second. How do I know he's not you and you're not him?
look at him. He's even a shitty carpenter.
let me see your chin. - My chin?
you cut yourself shaving. - Here.
okay, it's there. You're you.
I couldn't do it.
over here.
I have a little something for you.
is Clara asleep? - Yes, she is.
he's grabbing her ass.
I like how cigars make you feel.
daddy?
what are you doing out here?
I had a bad dream.
I'll take you back to bed. Come on.
fireman. - Fireman, right.
wait here.
cigar, sir?
I can't wait.
how do you like it? - This is so good.
want to try some?
no. Smoking's illegal, and I'm a mother... All right.
sweetheart, I'm sorry about the repet.
it's all right.
dad?
did Oliver die?
is he a repet?
why do you say that?
you locked him outside.
I did? Oh, I'm so sorry.
I haven't been myself lately.
all right. You go to sleep now.
close your eyes.
when was the last time we did it in the back of the car?
we should smoke cigars more often.
Mr. Gibson?
who are you? - Millennium Security. Sorry to...
you got any I. D?
of course.
sorry I was a little jumpy but we had a break-in earlier.
we know.
your car was found in the river.
they find the bastard that stole it?
relax. He's a friend of mine.
sorry about this.
nice 'do.
he's here to help me fix the garage.
Heel!
now what?
go see.
sorry, but he's a repet.
he was a good watchdog. Now he lets my car get stolen and barks.
I hate clones.
well, we'll keep an eye on your property.
I'll sleep better knowing you're around.
try to have a good night.
good night. - Take it easy.
hide.
stop it, Oliver.
stop it.
gee, you're glitchy today. Come on.
good Oliver. That was a bad idea.
let's get out of here. - We can't leave them with that thing.
those were the guys trying to kill me.
it's dangerous for Natalie and Clara if I hang around.
darling, you're still awake.
I wanted to wait up for you.
thank you.
and I wanted to spend time with these flowers.
it took me 17 generations to get this right.
if you had told me, I could have...
I know. Engineered it in half an hour.
I'm not in that much of a hurry, Griffin.
want to get a cup of tea, then go upstairs?
Yeah.
that's a good idea. Let's do that.
it's okay.
stay calm.
stay very, very calm.
what a night.
that was the longest night in my life.
Hello, Adam.
I'm a one-man Virtual Girl...
...but if you insert the installation disk..
what was that? - Nothing.
I felt fingers going for my zipper. That's disgusting.
that's disgusting? I had to look away when you and Natalie were...
the... You want a beer?
you saw the clone do something with Natalie.
they did nothing.
that's not what I would have done. - What would you have done?
I would have...
nothing.
well, that's what they did. You know... nothing.
shit. In the goddamn minivan.
in the minivan.
you know what tobacco does to people.
he smoked my stogie too?
the bastard.
that son of a bitch.
son of a bitch smoked your stogie.
she couldn't tell it wasn't me?
it didn't look like it. I mean, she seemed...
...happy.
you have no idea what it felt like seeing her with him.
I should have just killed him.
it could have been worse. At least she's not cheating on you.
don't move!
Tripp!
I'm not after you.
back away.
back away.
why did you do that?
don't do anything stupid, now. That's as far as you go.
is that you, Hank?
Hank!
Hey, Adam.
is Hank sleeping on the floor again?
that's so cute.
on the sixth day, God created man. On the sixth day...
on the sixth day, God created man. God created man on the sixth day.
why did you kill my friend?
Hank Morgan was an abomination to God.
he was a clone.
he was no clone.
the real Hank Morgan died this afternoon.
I killed him.
so I could...
...so I could kill Drucker.
drucker isn't dead. It would be all over the news.
open your eyes.
drucker's a clone.
Dr. Weir cloned Drucker. Dr. Weir cloned your friend.
Dr. Weir cloned you.
they found us.
shoot me in the head.
what... - We have people at Weir's lab!
I know who they are. They scan my brain, they'll be killed.
shoot me.
God forgive me.
doesn't anyone stay dead anymore?
who are you people?
I. D. Required.
use biometric reader...
...to verify identification...
...or the alarm will sound in 10 seconds. Ten...
he shot my foot! ...nine...
...six... five... - Son of a bitch!
stand by.
systems accessed.
Gibson!
select destination.
you're gonna pay!
those were brand-new boots!
dad? You're coming to my recital, right?
of course. I never miss your recitals.
I love you.
you're the greatest, Dad.
unless herpseudomonas infection clears up...
...l'm afraid there's nothing we can do.
what about her DNA scan?
came up with cystic fibrosis.
cystic fibrosis?
which is impossible, considering it's a childhood disease...
...and she would have been dead 30 years ago.
we're running the scan again.
no, I'll do it at the clinic. If you could give us a moment, please.
darling. Sweetheart.
we're having you transferred to my clinic.
no. I'd like to stay here.
I can help you at the clinic. If you stay here, there's nothing I can do.
I know, dear. I'll die.
Yes.
Katherine, please.
listen to me.
Katherine died 5 years ago.
the feelings I have aren't mine. They're hers.
Katherine, listen.
don't do this.
I need you so much. I need you.
I'm not afraid, Griffin.
I want to die.
my time has already passed.
my love.
what am I to do without you?
what?
you just water my flowers...
...okay?
Weir Clinic, stay away! No research on DNA!

thanks for visiting Replacement Technologies.
we're in the business oflife.
welcome to the new home of the Weir Organ Transplant Facility here at Replacement Technologies.
excuse me, sir. I've got to check that.
sure. Help yourself.
but...
...you might want to use these.
what's in here?
lower intestines for Dr. Weir.
he's doing a study on the flesh-eating virus.
you can open it.
just try not to breathe.
that's okay.
you're cleared.
Thanks.
what about herDNA scan?
came up with cystic fibrosis.
which is impossible considering it's a childhood disease dead 30 years ago.
so we're running a new scan.
no, I'll do it at the clinic.
we've had 6 extra years since you cloned me.
I treasure that.
Katherine, please. - No.
please.
I'm not afraid.
I want to die.
my time has already passed.
can I help you?
no. I just dropped my pen.
I'm all thumbs today.
thank you.
will you cut that out? It's driving me crazy.
excuse me, but I nearly had my head ripped off and it hurts.
it's only psychological. Your neck doesn't really hurt.
you'd know better about that?
Yes, he would.
it was your old neck that got broken. This is your new neck. Get it?
I got killed twice in two hours. - Knock it off. We've all been killed.
you know what really bothers me?
that I've never even seen a white light.
never seen angels. Nothing.
give me a break.
I have you logged in.
what? When?
twenty minutes ago. You've entered a restricted area.
son of a bitch has got my thumb.
deactivate Talia, put out a security alert...
...and seal off Drucker's office, now! Let's go!
shit.
can I help you?
Yeah.
you can stick your thumb on that.
thank God. - What? More fundamentalists?
no. Adam Gibson. We think he's in the building.
why wasn't he taken care of already?
there are four of you and one of him!
two of him, but you see what I mean.
he has a wife and kid, right? Get them. We may need the leverage.
it costs me $1. 2 million each time I clone you people.
try to be worth the money.
they'll kill you for seeing this.
they're doing their best already. Where's Dr. Weir?
his lab's over there.
Dr. Weir.
Dr. Weir.
I know about the intruder. Your office called.
everything's under control.
it's not under control.
you had me cloned.
Yes.
well, you cloned the wrong man.
how did you do it? You had to have my... What do you call it?
your syncording. We had it.
give it to me.
I want my life back.
here. It's your syncording.
how did you get this?

Gibson family schedule.
Clara's recital at school.
this is Michael Drucker's.
a syncording contains everything in a person's memory...
...and this is what Drucker saw and heard just before he died.
you don't become a rich man without making enemies...
...so we back up his mind religiously.
you own the Roadrunners, right? - Among other things.
you a fan? - I'm a fan ofboth those teams.
I'll have to get you some tickets.
promise, right? - Sure. I'll do it right now.
Sally, remind me to get Roadrunner tickets for Adam Gibson.
he's my pilot today.
on the sixth day, God created man.
I'm about to get on my snowboard... Hey, he's got a gun!
shit. It's a fundamentalist.
he just shot them both. Call Marshall. You hear me?
Sally? Oh, shit.
no, you don't have to... Sally!
help!
an anti-cloning fundamentalist killed everyone on board.
it should have been me.
we thought it was you. Drucker even mentioned your name.
so, we used your DNA and syncording to clone you.
to resurrect him, we had to cover it up.
keep talking.
we cloned everyone. We realized you switched places too late.
access denied. Invalid thumbprint.
they're trying to kill me. - There are two Adam Gibsons.
that's proof humans are being cloned...
...which makes you very dangerous to Drucker.
accessing security. - Tell me why I'm a threat.
drucker was killed 3 years ago. We cloned him then...
...and we cloned him yesterday. - So?
if that came out, he'd be destroyed in every way.
a clone has no rights. A clone can't own anything.
drucker would lose all this...
...because Drucker would be...
...legally dead.
look at all the cameras you got in this place.
you can't find one guy?
there. There.
we don't need where he's been. We need to find where he is.
let's go. Hit the alarm.
what's up? - What area's so sensitive...
...we don't allow cameras?
drucker will do anything...
anything to destroy the evidence.
and you're the evidence.
this is evidence too.
move! Clear the way!
let's go.
I have to go to the bathroom. - Okay, Clara.
anyone else need to go?
why do you think I'm telling you? Because I can do nothing to stop them.
there he is! - Zone Six. Engineering.
move! Clear the way!
or what they'll do to your family.
my family?
drucker has to kill one of you. If he can't kill you, he'll kill the other.
they could get killed in the process.
get out!

morgan Randall Elementary School!
I'm very sorry, sir.
daddy!
she's supposed to be up there now, right?
this is the...
that's odd.
I'm gonna go check and make sure everything's okay.
excuse me. - Of course.
Clara?
Oh, my God.
mommy!
mommy, I'm scared.
I'm here. I got you.
could you help us?
what are you doing?
this is the only thing keeping the dogs...
...from tearing her apart.
so be quiet and come with us.
let's go!
daddy! - Adam!
Natalie!
you have reached 911 emergency.
your call is important to us. - I know.
your "yes" or "no" answers...
...will help us in directing police services to assist you.
are you reporting a felony? - Yes.
thank you for reporting a felony. - Come on.
is the felony in progress now?
Yes!
thank you.
is there a danger of bodily harm to you or others?
Yes!
are suspects or injured victims...
forget about talking to the police. I tried that already.
who the hell are you?
I know this sounds insane, but...
...l'm Adam Gibson.
we don't have time for you to be shocked. They have Natalie and Clara.
I need your help to get my family. - They're my family.
that's for sleeping with my wife...
...in the damn minivan.
your report has been canceled at your request.
thanks for visiting Replacement Technologies.
it's him.
I believe you have something of mine.
no, I have everything of yours.
I have the syncording that proves you're a clone.
I have everything of yours:
your family in the palm of my hand.
shall we trade? - You read my mind.
just the highlights.
all right. I'll bring the disk to the Double X Charter office at 10: 00 tonight.
be there with my family.
did you have to hit me that hard?
I had to stop you from talking to the police.
that's a good one.
that should do it.
what are you doing?
testing it. I don't think you have enough aluminum.
are you kidding? That's the same amount I used in the Rain Forest War.
you shouldn't be talking.
the mess you left trying to fix your garage...
you saw me working in the garage? - Saw you?
I nearly shot you.
let's try it.
cool. - Cool.
you better be miles away when this goes off.
I'm worried about getting inside to find Natalie and Clara.
I'll take my chances getting out.
Griffin.
here.
what are you doing? - Yours. Yours.
Griffin, what's the matter?
my wife, Katherine, is dead.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Griffin, I don't know...
I'm so sorry.
don't start with "sorry" with me. Don't start!
don't start with "sorry"!
I know about the congenital defects you've been imbedding...
...into the clone DNA.
there's my wife, Johnny Phoenix and the others.
but, Michael, why my wife? Why?
you're right, Griffin.
it's a security protocol I implemented. I knew you wouldn't understand.
what should I understand?
the only thing I understand is that...
...you gave my wife cystic fibrosis!
calm down.
someone made a mistake. This wasn't meant to hurt her.
it didn't hurt her. It killed her.
suppose we clone a senator who agrees to support us, then doesn't.
or Johnny Phoenix wants more money. Shorter life spans gives us leverage.
what's the point?
the point is, if they betray us they're dead.
if they stay on the team, we clone them again.
exactly what we'll do with Katherine. I'm sure she's being cloned now.
no, she's not.
no. - She's...
Griffin, it was a mistake.
if you're concerned about her DNA, go through it yourself.
obviously there's no charge for the cloning.
no charge. Thank you very much.
what you don't understand is, she doesn't want to be cloned.
so, do it anyway.
do it anyway. I see.
let me explain something to you.
I loved my wife very much.
so much so, I promised I'd never bring her back again.
and I won't.
and if I can't bring her back, I'll never bring back anyone, ever.
that's how much I loved her.
so, it's over, it's finished...
...and I quit.
well, I can't let you quit.
I've looked the other way too often.
I've justified too much, so...
...l'm finished. It's over.
know what I'm going to do for you? - What are you going to do for me?
I'm going to give you...
...the greatest gift you can imagine.
a gift? - I'm gonna save your life.
I'm gonna save Katherine's life. I'm gonna save our friendship.
and I'm gonna save your marriage.
what are you talking about?
I'm gonna kill you now...
...and I'm going to clone you using your latest syncording.
then I'll clone Katherine using her last syncording.
you understand?
do you see what I'm doing for you?
you'll be together, neither of you will remember you promised not to clone her.
or that she even died.
obviously you won't remember this conversation.
you're welcome.
all right, now show me my family.
bastards. I knew it.
your syncording isn't here.
it was being flown by remote.
both of you, get back here now.
come on.
this is a private pad. You can't land that here.
I'm here to pick up Mr. Drucker.
it's my charter contract.
everything's normal, Mr. Drucker, but we'll stay alert.
what time are you taking off?
take off? I didn't order...
your pilot's on his way to reception.
now you listen to me.
seal the building. Full security alert.
find this pilot. He is armed and dangerous.
and get Wiley and some men up to my office now.
freeze the elevators. Shut down level 2 and 3 parking garages.
zone 6, engineering corridor. - There. Sector 3.
he's headed right towards you, Dan. Turn around!
don't try it.
get people up the stairwell!
teams 3 and 4, close off on him! Let's go!
he shot out a power box. - He's trashing the whole system.
we got him trapped. West stairwell between 13 and 14.
let's go!
cover the stairwell doors!
fire in front of him!
okay!
you did pretty good!
fooled us at the airport!
managed to turn this place into shambles!
you're the greatest, Dad!
Mr. Drucker would like to talk to you.
and, of course, we do have your family!
all right.
go get him.
well, well.
Adam Gibson. - I wish I could say, "the one and only.
looks like we both went back on our word.
you'll find we have more in common... - Where's my family?
right to business.
an admirable trait.
there they are. All safe and sound.
for the moment.
your syncording is not on him...
...It's not in his whisper craft.
I knew you'd double-cross me, so I gave it to my clone.
anything happens to me or my family...
...the next time you see it will be at your murder trial.
Dr. Weir didn't tell you.
tell me what?
Adam, Adam, Adam.
he's not the clone.
you are.
ask yourself something.
you remember anything after being scanned by my bodyguard?
I need to check your vision. Place your chin here.
changing places with your friend?
buddy, wake up. We're here. Woodland Mall.
the salesman at repet thought it was...
...odd you came in twice.
asked the same questions...
...twice.
still can't make up yourmind, huh?
you lost a dog, right?
let me see your chin.
you cut yourself shaving.
your shaving cut?
easily reproduced.
so is the scar from your old war wound.
I know who I am.
I know you do.
Talia?
how many times have you been cloned?
I've lost count.
there's one way to tell.
show him.
it's the only way to track what generation a clone is.
see? Four dots means...
...She's been cloned four times.
come on.
let's take a look at yours.
take a look in the mirror.
let's find out if you are who you think you are.
just under your left eye.
kind of takes the fun out of being alive, doesn't it?
so, you see...
...your family isn't really your family.
they're his.
and you, my friend, are in exactly the same boat as all of us.
if Adam Gibson gets that syncording to the authorities...
...We'll all be destroyed.
if you really love your wife and kid...
...you'll tell me where Adam Gibson is.
we'll get my syncording back, we'll get rid of him.
you'll tell me where Adam Gibson is.
we'll get my syncording back, we'll get rid of him.
they'll never know you're the clone.
that, or lose them forever.
Adam, I'm not making this offer because I have to.
I can get everything from your memories.
the fact is, I'd like you to understand...
...you'd be serving a higher purpose.
in two years, three tops, I'll control enough votes to get the laws changed.
then we won't have to lose our best people. Our Mozarts...
...our Martin Luther Kings.
we will finally be able to conquer death.
we will finally be able to conquer death.
and who gets to decide...
...who lives and who dies?
you?
you have a better idea?
Yeah.
what about God?
you're one of those. I suppose you think science is inherently evil.
no, I don't think science is inherently evil.
but I think you are.
if you believe God created man in His own image...
...you believe He gave man power to understand evolution...
...to exploit science, to manipulate the genetic code.
to do exactly what I'm doing.
I'm just taking over where God left off.
if you really believe that, then you should clone yourself...
...while you're still alive.
Why's that? So I can understand your unique perspective?
no. So you can go fuck yourself.
now you'll tell us where you put Mr. Drucker's syncording!
you won't find it in my head.
I told him to hide it so I wouldn't know where it is.
we'll see about that. - Yeah, we will.
let's go. Get in here.
come on!
come on!
come on!
fine! Have it your way!
that didn't hurt so bad.
asshole.
let's go back a few minutes.
here's Drucker's syncording.
there's the other one.
keep this.
if l'm not back in an hour, you know what to do.
don't worry. Lf anything happens to you or my family...
...l'm gonna destroy that son of a bitch.
you got the location?
the airport. I was just there. He'll be dead in 20 minutes.
let's go.
betrayed by your own mind.
wait! Wait!
what?
they staged that scene for us.
the other one sat behind him so we couldn't see him.
the bastard faked his own syncording.
one hid and this one avoided looking at him so he wouldn't be in his memory.
you mean the other one's here too?
Yes, that's correct.
now put out another alert. This one is the diversion!
he smashes the cameras, gets captured...
...meanwhile, the other one strolls in and takes his wife and kid.
idiot!
Natalie, Clara.
Oh, my God. What's going on? - Daddy?
don't worry, sir.
get him up.
I'm scared, Dad.
what's going on?
this isn't because of the cigar? - No. I'll explain to you later.
don't worry. He's not going anywhere. We'll get him.
wait.
Talia, you go. You two stay here.
have them block all the exits.
Henderson...
...seal off the tank area, levels 6 and 7.
I'm trying. Give me a minute.
and get us some power up here.
don't move. My daughter is right inside that door.
I don't want to expose her to any graphic violence.
she already gets enough of that from the media.
put your weapons down.
nice and easy. Good.
now, when you go inside...
...you say...
have a nice flight, little girl.
they're friends of Daddy's.
all right, let's go.
we'll have a little midnight flight with Daddy and Mommy.
there we are.
all right?
there you go, sir.
Wiley.
go.
wiley, just wait one second.
not again.
and don't bring him back.
stupid bastard blew a hole through my stomach.
God.
I'll be dead in 20 minutes, tops.
but what better place, right?
Henderson? Where's my power?
coming on-line now, sir.
get all exits blocked. All exits!
shit.
go start warming up a blank.
do a fresh syncording. I want my mind up-to-the-minute.
here it is. This is a fresh one.
this will be a complete syncording.
is that Talia?
go help her.
we'll find them.
what have you got? - Tanks 3 and 4, nothing.
okay, go. Take the back walk.
no.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
take her to your mother's...
...and stay there until I come.
come with us, Daddy.
I have to help a friend, okay? Bye.
I love you.
wiley, you shot me!
Oh, right. That was you.
I've got to get dressed.
you're not even going to wait...
...until I die?
would you?
come on.
get it off.
you got blood on the jacket. Jesus Christ.
what?
what?
what?
look...
...we can make a deal.
I didn't do anything to you. It was all him.
listen to me.
I can rebuild all this in a very short time.
I can still save you, Adam.
save me?
we put defects in the clone DNA to give them short life spans.
want to know what you'll die of? How long you've got to live?
we can go right upstairs and look it up.
we all have to die someday.
we don't have to die.
I'm offering you the chance to live forever. Never aging.
perfect in every way.
perfect? Like you?
look.
here is your "perfection.
Oh, God.
there's no need to panic. I can fix this.
you won't fix anything.
it's over. It's finished.
it's finished.
when I said you should screw yourself...
...I didn't mean for you to take it literally.
go after him.
get him.
check the roof!
you! Up top!
come on!
can you fly this? - Better than you can.
good. Because your shooting sucks.
let's get out of here.
shit.
come on!
try to climb over me!
come on! Hurry up!
come on!
shit!
you know, I keep wondering...
...am I really human?
do I have a soul?
well, your DNA scan came back normal, didn't it?
Yeah. Zero defects.
just like a repet commercial.
if you're not human, they would have mentioned it.
all right, enough philosophy.
I better get going.
I've got 3 weeks at sea to figure it out.
hurry if you want to see Clara.
thanks for letting me say goodbye to your family.
now, wait.
this is your family too.
you were willing to die to save them.
think about that while you're at sea...
...wondering if you're really human or not.
because if that's not being human...
...I don't know what is.
Thanks.
Hello, everybody.
look what I brought. - A kitty!
Oh, Sadie.
I thought that...
...Hank's cat was a...
she is.
but you hate repets.
well, I changed my mind.
you old softie.
can we keep her?
please? - Of course.
that's why I brought her home. Put her down.
good.
thank you so much
I'm not afraid, Griffin.
I want to die.
my time has already passed.
my love.
what am I to do without you?
what?
you just water my flowers...
...okay?
Weir Clinic, stay away! No research on DNA!
Weir Clinic, stay away! No research on DNA!
thanks for visiting Replacement Technologies.
we're in the business of life.
welcome to the new home of the Weir Organ Transplant Facility...
...Here at Replacement Technologies.
excuse me, sir. I've got to check that.
sure. Help yourself.
but...
...you might want to use these.
what's in here?
lower intestines for Dr. Weir.
he's doing a study on the flesh-eating virus.
you can open it.
just try not to breathe.
that's okay.
you're cleared.
Thanks.
what about her DNA scan?
came up with cystic fibrosis.
which is impossible considering it's a childhood disease...
dead 30 years ago.
so we're running a new scan.
no, I'll do it at the clinic.
we've had 6 extra years since you cloned me.
I treasure that.
Katherine, please. - No.
please.
I'm not afraid.
I want to die.
my time has already passed.
can I help you?
no. I just dropped my pen.
I'm all thumbs today.
thank you.
will you cut that out? It's driving me crazy.
excuse me, but I nearly had my head ripped off and it hurts.
it's only psychological. Your neck doesn't really hurt.
you'd know better about that?
Yes, he would.
it was your old neck that got broken. This is your new neck. Get it?
I got killed twice in two hours. - Knock it off. We've all been killed.
you know what really bothers me?
that I've never even seen a white light.
never seen angels. Nothing.
give me a break.
I have you logged in.
what? When?
twenty minutes ago. You've entered a restricted area.
son of a bitch has got my thumb.
deactivate Talia, put out a security alert...
...and seal off Drucker's office, now! Let's go!
shit.
can I help you?
Yeah.
you can stick your thumb on that.
thank God. - What? More fundamentalists?
no. Adam Gibson. We think he's in the building.
why wasn't he taken care of already?
there are four of you and one of him!
two of him, but you see what I mean.
he has a wife and kid, right? Get them. We may need the leverage.
it costs me $1. 2 million each time I clone you people.
try to be worth the money.
they'll kill you for seeing this.
they're doing their best already. Where's Dr. Weir?
his lab's over there.
Dr. Weir.
Dr. Weir.
I know about the intruder. Your office called.
everything's under control.
it's not under control.
you had me cloned.
Yes.
well, you cloned the wrong man.
how did you do it? You had to have my... What do you call it?
your syncording. We had it.
give it to me.
I want my life back.
here. It's your syncording.
how did you get this?
I haven't been... - Here.
the vision test.
it didn't test vision. It took your syncording.
an exact picture of your mind.
and it took sample of DNA. With those we can clone a person in 2 hours.

do it anyway. I see.
let me explain something to you.
I loved my wife very much.
so much so, I promised I'd never bring her back again.
and I won't.
and if I can't bring her back, I'll never bring back anyone, ever.
that's how much I loved her.
so, it's over, it's finished...
...and I quit.
well, I can't let you quit.
I've looked the other way too often.
I've justified too much, so l'm finished. It's over.
know what I'm going to do for you? - What are you going to do for me?
I'm going to give you the greatest gift you can imagine.
a gift? - I'm gonna save your life.
I'm gonna save Katherine's life. I'm gonna save our friendship.
and I'm gonna save your marriage.
what are you talking about?
I'm gonna kill you now...
...and I'm going to clone you using your latest syncording.
then I'll clone Katherine using her last syncording.
you understand?
do you see what I'm doing for you?
you'll be together, neither of you will remember you promised not to clone her.
or that she even died.
obviously you won't remember this conversation.
you're welcome.
all right, now show me my family.
bastards. I knew it.
your syncording isn't here.
it was being flown by remote.
both of you, get back here now.
come on.
this is a private pad. You can't land that here.
I'm here to pick up Mr. Drucker.
it's my charter contract.
everything's normal, Mr. Drucker, but we'll stay alert.
what time are you taking off?
take off? I didn't order...
your pilot's on his way to reception.
now you listen to me.
seal the building. Full security alert.
find this pilot. He is armed and dangerous.
and get Wiley and some men up to my office now.
freeze the elevators. Shut down level 2 and 3 parking garages.
zone 6, engineering corridor. - There. Sector 3.
he's heading right towards you, Dan. Turn around!
don't try it.
get people up the stairwell!
teams 3 and 4, close off on him! Let's go!
he shot out a power box. - He's trashing the whole system.
we got him trapped. West stairwell between 13 and 14.
let's go!
cover the stairwell doors!
fire in front of him!
okay!
you did pretty good!
fooled us at the airport!
managed to turn this place into shambles!
you're the greatest, Dad!
Mr. Drucker would like to talk to you.
and, of course, we do have your family!
all right.
go get him.
well, well.
Adam Gibson. - I wish I could say, "the one and only.
looks like we both went back on our word.
you'll find we have more in common... - Where's my family?
right to business.
an admirable trait.
there they are. All safe and sound.
for the moment.
your syncording is not on him...
...It's not in his whisper craft.
I knew you'd double-cross me, so I gave it to my clone.
anything happens to me or my family...
...the next time you see it will be at your murder trial.
Dr. Weir didn't tell you.
tell me what?
Adam, Adam, Adam.
he's not the clone.
you are.
ask yourself something.
you remember anything after being scanned by my bodyguard?
I need to check your vision. Place your chin here.
changing places with your friend?
buddy, wake up. We're here. Woodland Mall.
the salesman at RePet thought it was odd you came in twice.
asked the same questions...
...twice.
still can't make up your mind, huh?
you lost a dog, right?
let me see your chin.
you cut yourself shaving.
your shaving cut?
easily reproduced.
so is the scar from your old war wound.
I know who I am.
I know you do.
Talia?
how many times have you been cloned?
I've lost count.
there's one way to tell.
show him.
it's the only way to track what generation a clone is.
see? Four dots means she's been cloned four times.
come on.
let's take a look at yours.
take a look in the mirror.
let's find out if you are who you think you are.
just under your left eye.
kind of takes the fun out of being alive, doesn't it?
so, you see...
...your family isn't really your family.
they're his.
and you, my friend, are in exactly the same boat as all of us.
if Adam Gibson gets that syncording to the authorities...
...We'll all be destroyed.
if you really love your wife and kid...
...you'll tell me where Adam Gibson is.
we'll get my syncording back, we'll get rid of him.
you'll tell me where Adam Gibson is.
we'll get my syncording back, we'll get rid of him.
they'll never know you're the clone.
that, or lose them forever.
Adam, I'm not making this offer because I have to.
I can get everything from your memories.
the fact is, I'd like you to understand...
...you'd be serving a higher purpose.
in two years, three tops, I'll control enough votes to get the laws changed.
then we won't have to lose our best people. Our Mozarts...
...our Martin Luther Kings.
we will finally be able to conquer death.
we will finally be able to conquer death.
and who gets to decide who lives and who dies?
you?
you have a better idea?
Yeah.
what about God?
you're one of those. I suppose you think science is inherently evil.
no, I don't think science is inherently evil.
but I think you are.
if you believe God created man in His own image...
...you believe He gave man power to understand evolution...
...to exploit science, to manipulate the genetic code.
to do exactly what I'm doing.
I'm just taking over where God left off.
if you really believe that, then you should clone yourself while you're still alive.
Why's that? So I can understand your unique perspective?
no. So you can go fuck yourself.
now you'll tell us where you put Mr. Drucker's syncording!
you won't find it in my head.
I told him to hide it so I wouldn't know where it is.
we'll see about that. - Yeah, we will.
let's go. Get in here.
come on!
come on!
come on!
fine! Have it your way!
that didn't hurt so bad.
asshole.
let's go back a few minutes.
here's Drucker's syncording.
there's the other one.
keep this.
if l'm not back in an hour, you know what to do.
don't worry. If anything happens to you or my family...
...l'm gonna destroy that son of a bitch.
you got the location?
the airport. I was just there. He'll be dead in 20 minutes.
let's go.
betrayed by your own mind.
wait! Wait!
what?
they staged that scene for us.
the other one sat behind him so we couldn't see him.
the bastard faked his own syncording.
one hid and this one avoided looking at him so he wouldn't be in his memory.
you mean the other one's here too?
Yes, that's correct.
now put out another alert. This one is the diversion!
he smashes the cameras, gets captured...
...meanwhile, the other one strolls in and takes his wife and kid.
idiot!
Natalie, Clara.
Oh, my God. What's going on? - Daddy?
don't worry, sir.
get him up.
I'm scared, Dad.
what's going on?
this isn't because of the cigar? - No. I'll explain to you later.
don't worry. He's not going anywhere. We'll get him.
wait.
Talia, you go. You two stay here.
have them block all the exits.
Henderson...
...seal off the tank area, levels 6 and 7.
I'm trying. Give me a minute.
and get us some power up here.
don't move. My daughter is right inside that door.
I don't want to expose her to any graphic violence.
she already gets enough of that from the media.
put your weapons down.
nice and easy. Good.
now, when you go inside...
...you say...
have a nice flight, little girl.
they're friends of Daddy's.
all right, let's go.
we'll have a little midnight flight with Daddy and Mommy.
there we are.
all right?
there you go, sir.
Wiley.
go.
wiley, just wait one second.
not again.
and don't bring him back.
stupid bastard blew a hole through my stomach.
God.
I'll be dead in 20 minutes, tops.
but what better place, right?
Henderson? Where's my power?
coming on-line now, sir.
get all exits blocked. All exits!
shit.
go start warming up a blank.
do a fresh syncording. I want my mind up-to-the-minute.
here it is. This is a fresh one.
this will be a complete syncording.
is that Talia?
go help her.
we'll find them.
what have you got? - Tanks 3 and 4, nothing.
okay, go. Take the back walk.
no.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
take her to your mother's...
...and stay there until I come.
come with us, Daddy.
I have to help a friend, okay? Bye.
I love you.
wiley, you shot me!
Oh, right. That was you.
I've got to get dressed.
you're not even going to wait...
...until I die?
would you?
come on.
get it off.
you got blood on the jacket. Jesus Christ.
what?
what?
what?
look...
...we can make a deal.
I didn't do anything to you. It was all him.
listen to me.
I can rebuild all this in a very short time.
I can still save you, Adam.
save me?
we put defects in the clone DNA to give them short life spans.
want to know what you'll die of? How long you've got to live?
we can go right upstairs and look it up.
we all have to die someday.
we don't have to die.
I'm offering you the chance to live forever. Never aging.
perfect in every way.
perfect? Like you?
look.
here is your "perfection.
Oh, God.
there's no need to panic. I can fix this.
you won't fix anything.
it's over. It's finished.
it's finished.
when I said you should screw yourself...
...I didn't mean for you to take it literally.
go after him.
get him.
check the roof!
you! Up top!
come on!
can you fly this? - Better than you can.
good. Because your shooting sucks.
let's get out of here.
shit.
come on!
try to climb over me!
come on! Hurry up!
come on!
shit!
you know, I keep wondering...
...am I really human?
do I have a soul?
well, your DNA scan came back normal, didn't it?
Yeah. Zero defects.
just like a RePet commercial.
if you're not human, they would have mentioned it.
all right, enough philosophy.
I better get going.
I've got 3 weeks at sea to figure it out.
hurry if you want to see Clara.
thanks for letting me say goodbye to your family.
now, wait.
this is your family too.
you were willing to die to save them.
think about that while you're at sea...
...wondering if you're really human or not.
because if that's not being human...
...I don't know what is.
Thanks.
Hello, everybody.
look what I brought. - A kitty!
Oh, Sadie.
I thought that...
...Hank's cat was a...
she is.
but you hate RePets.
well, I changed my mind.
you old softie.
can we keep her?
please? - Of course.
that's why I brought her home. Put her down.
good.
thank you so much
moscow, RUSSIA
suspect from tunnel auto chase, heading east from Kievsky Train Station.
send him in.
will you commit to this program?
I can't.
will you commit to this program?
will you commit to this program?
I can't.
six WEEKS LATER
central INTELLIGENCE AGENCY LANGLEY, VIR GINIA
there's no place it won't catch up to you.
it's how every story ends.
it's what you are, Jason, a killer.
you always will be.
go ahead. Go on. Go on! Do it! Do it!
she wouldn't want me to.
that's the only reason you're alive.
who is "she"?
Marie Kreutz, his girlfriend.
she was killed in India.
director of Operations Ward Abbott arranged it.
so we have a dirty section chief who kills Bourne's girl.
Bourne comes back for revenge, tapes Abbott's confession and Abbott commits suicide.
now Bourne's gunning for us.
you couldn't make this stuff up.
Bourne's last confirmed location was Moscow, six weeks ago.
right. Sir.
he's on the run. He's dangerous.
well, sir, with respect, I think something else could be going on here.
what? What's he after?
the reason Bourne went to Moscow was to see the daughter of his first target.
what's your point, Pam?
maybe he was retracing his steps.
he's looking for something. Something in his past.
maybe he hasn't found it yet and we need to know what it is.
are you telling me he's not a threat to this agency?
I think if he wanted to hurt us, he could have sent the tape to CNN.
maybe he still will.
my number one rule is hope for the best, plan for the worst.
as far as I'm concerned, Bourne is still a serious threat until proven otherwise.
let's keep looking.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
this one's three years ago. They had half of InterpoI after him.
turned up in Naples, Berlin, Moscow...
disappeared again.
the girl that he was on the run with.
Marie Kreutz. She was found dead in a river halfway round the world.
she'd been shot in the head.
what connects the dots?
turn off the tape recorder.
Where's my sister?
why don't you sit down?
where is she?
she's dead.
she was killed.
I'm sorry.
I knew this could end this way.
it was always gonna end this way.
I didn't believe that.
and how did she die?
she was shot.
we were together in India.
he came for me.
you killed him?
Yes.
and now what?
someone started all of this and I'm gonna find them.
Hey. It's me.
Yeah. He knows the whole story.
Bourne's just the tip of the iceberg.
have you heard of an Operation Blackbriar?
I'm gonna get my head around this and type it up.
I'll see you first thing.
okay.
scanning. GoSat 21. I have a hit on ECHELON. Blackbriar.
I repeat, Blackbriar.
looks like it's coming from a European signal.
NSA, please confirm your receipt.
I'll bring up the frequency and the coordinates ...intercept of our principal...
sir! What you got?
we intercepted a call in London. Keyword, "Blackbriar.
okay, send it to New York right away.
track the phone?
registered to a London reporter named Simon Ross.
works at the Guardian newspaper.
you're tracking him? Sir. Yeah.
Thanks, Mike.
we have a survey team covering him at work and a sneak and peek's on their way to his apartment.
well, who talked to him? How did he find out about Blackbriar?
I don't know. We pulled his background and ran a cross-check on any known anomalies.
we've come up with nothing. But I think if we follow Ross, we're gonna be able...
ray, Ross is easy. We want the source.
have you heard of an Operation Blackbriar?
you have details?
I'm gonna get my head around this and type it up.
I'll see you first thing.
is that all? Yeah.
I want rendition protocols and put the asset on standby, just in case.
people, listen up! This is a full priority situation.
Jimmy, give me Ross' profile on one.
Yes, sir.
our target is a British nationaI, Simon Ross. A reporter.
I want all his phones, his BlackBerry, his apartment, his car, bank accounts, credit cards, traveI patterns.
I want to know what he's gonna think before he does.
every dirty little secret he has.
and most of all, we want the name and reaI-time location of his source.
this is NSA priority leveI four. Any questions?
all right, let's get to it.
what?
will you commit to this program?
I can't.
copy that. Mr. Wills, the subject is entering his office.
give me some eyeballs on the street.
Where's my picture, please?
coming online.
online now.
Jimmy, how you doing with the phone line?
Yeah, we have an office line. We're working on his cell.
how long? An hour, sir.
that's too long.
so how do we know he's not spinning for someone?
there was more. He was scared.
scared about what? Blackbriar.
sorry. Call for you. Who is it?
won't give his name.
excuse me.
he's on my line. Thanks.
Simon Ross.
camera three, screen.
why aren't we hearing this?
Jimmy? That's a hard line, Jimmy. Why don't we have it?
we have his line, sir, but he's not on it. He's using a different phone.
I've been reading your stories.
who is this? This is Jason Bourne.
waterloo Station. South entrance. Thirty minutes. Come alone.
get me audio as soon as you can, Ted.
street teams Alpha, Bravo.
okay, guys, let's work it. Come on.
Where's he going?
okay, he is on the move. Give me eyeballs on the street. Let's go.
subject exiting the building.
all right, everyone, let's find out where he's going.
mobile One, I need audio.
audio engaged.
mobile One should have him. Mobile One should have him.
get Mobile One on it. Let me know when you hear it.
Hi. Waterloo Station, south entrance.
Mr. Wills. Where's he going?
destination is Waterloo Station.
okay, Waterloo Station.
give me eyes at Waterloo. Put everyone in play.
let's activate the asset. Mobilize Tracker Three.
are we at the bridge yet? Not yet, sir.
okay, Mobile Three, tell them to stay back.
sir.
please maintain visuaI contact.
prepaid phone.
here you go.
mobile One, give me the subject's current location.
copy that.
sir, the subject is arriving at the south entrance of Waterloo Station.
Hello?
give me that on five and seven as well.
Jimmy, I need that phone.
I want you to listen very carefully to what I'm about to tell you.
what the hell's going on?
ten o'clock, to your left, across the street, there's a silver Chrysler Voyager.
there's a surveillance team inside.
directly across the street, twelve noon, there's a man on the second story, static post.
he's watching you.
now, there's a bus stop 50 meters to your left.
I want you to walk towards it.
Jimmy, I need that phone! I need it yesterday.
he's on the move. He's on the move.
that's not his phone, sir.
say again?
that's not his phone, sir.
what do you mean that's not his phone?
where the hell did he get another phone?
well, no, you just have to...
grab Team B, stand by.
grab Team B. We're in position.
all right, there's a man in a blue hooded sweatshirt.
he's talking on a phone. Walk directly to him and stop.
Jimmy, we need the call. I need that cell phone.
do not let him get out of sight.
all right, turn around.
okay, who's the guy in the blue hood?
is that his contact?
all right, there's a bus coming. It'll be there in ten seconds.
when it stops, I want you to walk directly to your left.
there's an overpass. Go up the stairs. Stop at the newsstand.
you'll get further instructions.
okay. Okay.
get ready to move.
watch that bus. Watch that bus.
what? All right, what's going on?
somebody tell me. We lost the feed. Grab Team B.
intercept the contact and stay with Ross.
Hey! Stop!
mobile One. Target's on the move.
okay, he's on the move. Do not lose Ross.
blue hood! Down! Now!
go! Let's go.
Oh, shit.
what the hell was that?
sir, we've lost all communication with Mobile One.
to the right! Heading west. Let us know when you get a visuaI!
what was the last known position, please?
on the walkway, heading towards the concourse, sir.
it's a surveillance nightmare. It's the busiest terminaI in London.
give me all of CCTV's eyes.
on it, sir.
sir, asset's on scene.
who's your source?
what's his name? What's your source's name?
look, what's going on? Why are these people after me?
because you found something.
you talked to someone inside Treadstone.
someone who was there at the beginning. Who is it?
you know I can't tell you that.
you have no idea what you're into here. These people will kill you, if they have to.
was it Blackbriar? Is that what this is?
what's Blackbriar?
Treadstone upgrade. My source told me it all started with you.
he said that you were square one, the dirty little secret.
he said he knows who you are.
all right, we have to move.
answer your phone.
coming online. You got visual?
where the hell is he, people?
do exactly as I say. I need you to move up to your right.
first escalator on the right.
tie your shoe. Tie your shoe right now. Tie your shoe.
wait.
wait.
I'm gonna walk by you. I want you to move along the far wall
stand up.
that's it.
where the hell is he?
we cannot afford to lose this guy, people.
all right, that line you're on is good. Stay on that line. Stay on that line.
I've gotta go and pick up the kids. Can you go and get the shopping done?
Oh, the bin man, I think he's one of them.
the garbage man? Negative.
Oh, Jesus. Jesus! He's reaching for something.
Oh, God, he's got a gun. Stay on the line.
he's got a gun. He's got a gun.
stay on the line you're on. Do not deviate.
okay, there he is! Here he goes.
grab Team A. Go!
he's still talking to somebody.
he's getting instructions. Jimmy, get me the conversation.
mobile Two, I want... Come on, lock the box.
lock the box. Move in, Grab Team C.
hurry, Ross. We gotta move.
okay, move through this crowd. Move through this crowd.
get undercover right now. Move through this crowd.
get in the store.
there's someone on your taiI. Get in the store.
you're gonna proceed out the east exit.
that's to your right as you come into the store.
head into the liquor store in front of you.
go into the back and lock the door.
mobile Four is down.
this guy's got help. Tell me when the asset's in the nest.
get me a feed in there!
I want Grab Team C in there. Tell me what's going on.
team Four is mobile.
Jesus Christ.
that's Jason Bourne.
he's picking us apart. Do you think he's the source?
he's gotta be.
block all the exits. Give the asset a green light.
take them both out.
stay there.
I'm gonna get us out of here. You gotta do exactly what I say.
listen to me! This isn't some story in a newspaper.
this is reaI. You understand me?
okay.
call all agents back.
give Bourne's location at the back of the store to the asset.
Yes, sir.
kill the cameras.
Bourne. Wait. Something's not right.
I can see the entrance from here. If I go now, I can make it.
Bourne?
just stay where you are.
I don't think we should wait!
I think someone's coming.
I'm going for it.
no, no, no, no, no!
we have a situation.
Yeah.
director Kramer would like to see you.
we need to get those warrants...
he said it's urgent.
what the police will tell me is that they believe the victim is 35-year-old
Simon Ross, a well-known journalist based here in London with the Guardian newspaper.
it appears that he was gunned down right in the middle of the Waterloo Station concourse around 3. 45 this afternoon in full view of hundreds of commuters.
over the years, he's uncovered a lot of unsavory stories about terror that have upset certain Western governments and...
Hi, how are you? Right over there?
all right.
good morning, sir. Can I take your order? Yes.
I'll have the Heart-Healthy omelet with goat cheese and peppers, please.
anything for you, madam? Just coffee, please.
are you sure? I'm buying.
I'm good.
so, when the Director called and it was suggested that we bring you on...
suggested? You sure it was just a suggestion?
you know, it's funny how different things look depending on where you sit, right?
I look at this as a favor for you, Pam, giving you an opportunity to complete some unfinished business.
Meaning?
Bourne. He's here. He's a threat.
and we both want the same thing.
but we both go about it in two very different ways.
the past is past, Pam. All right?
we were careless in Stockholm.
so what was Waterloo? Just careless again?
we had a leak. A serious nationaI security situation.
Bourne showed up on our surveillance and we had very little time to react.
and a reporter got killed.
Bourne saw us coming. The question is what was he doing there?
no, the reaI question is how you managed to get into a firefight at a public train station.
you know as well as I do decisions made in reaI time are never perfect.
don't second-guess an operation from an armchair.
I'll see you at the office.
enjoy your egg whites.
people!
this is Pamela Landy and her associate, Tom Cronin.
she's gonna be quarterbacking the search effort.
say your names. State your specs, please.
well, let's do names later, okay? What's Bourne's last fixed position?
london, 1200 Zulu.
status. What is he? Armed? Wounded?
alive, mobile and unknown.
do we have an ECHELON package? Yes.
why isn't it on? We were waiting.
waiting? For what? What... Listen, people, do you have any idea who you're dealing with?
this is Jason Bourne.
you are nine hours behind the toughest target you have ever tracked.
now, I want everyone to sit down, strap in and turn on all you've got.
that would mean now!
thank you.
give me a team deployment plan.
I want everything you got on Ross on screen one.
sir, I think we have something.
we just hacked Ross' e-maiI account at the Guardian.
found a round-trip ticket to Turin, Italy, yesterday.
0800 arrivaI, 1205 departure.
I think we can be pretty certain that Bourne's not your source, then.
how?
Ross's call to his editor where he said he'd just met the source took place just after his Turin flight landed.
he met his source in Turin. So?
what? So, what? Bourne met Ross in Turin for breakfast and then at noon the same day Bourne calls Ross to demand a meet at Waterloo?
maybe they were even on the same flight.
pull up everything you've got.
cross-check the secure cell phone usage of everyone with SCI clearance against all calls going in and out of Turin, Italy, the morning Ross was there.
this guy you're after is a CIA operative with clearance above top secret.
he's committing treason by talking to Ross.
do you really think while doing that he's gonna use a cell phone that he knows we can track?
zero results on the cross-check.
so, you got any better ideas?
Yeah, look at all the people whose cell phones were switched off the entire period Ross was in Turin.
I mean, if your people are on their phones as much as mine, the list should be pretty small.
three names. Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin and NeaI Daniels.
okay, now check everything in Ross' apartment against those names.
check for common patterns.
look for anything that indicates who Ross met.
pull up his socials. Pull it up.
see those documents?
break it.
over here. What is that?
all right. Right there. Initials.
pull that up. Bring that up on main.
NeaI Daniels.
he's station chief in Madrid, isn't he?
Yeah.
all right, call the RSO at the embassy.
have them take Daniels into custody, if he is there.
Anna, get grab teams to the Calle Norte safe house.
send them in heavy. Tell them we'll assist with the entry.
heavy? Daniels isn't really that much of a...
I'm worried about Bourne.
if he is not the source, then he is after the source, the same as we are.
ETA, Team Two.
three minutes to destination, sir.
your mission will save American lives.
really give yourself to this program.
I can't.
you can.
sir, they're at the front door.
five seconds. Put it up live.
we're in.
the alarm's down.
that's gotta be Bourne.
the safe is empty. Shit.
looks like he left in a hurry.
track Daniels' passports.
stand by.
God damn it! Get a backup team in there!
get me a secure line in there. Get the second team over there now!
what are you doing here?
I was posted here after Berlin.
Where's Daniels?
where is he?
Hello?
who is this?
this is Nicky Parsons.
she was Treadstone. Logistics.
she was with us when we hunted Bourne in Berlin.
Nicky, I need to do an ID challenge.
code in, Sparrow.
response, Everest.
Nicky, this is Noah Vosen. How long have you been on-site?
I just walked in.
we have two officers on-site. Are you in contact with them?
they're down. Unconscious but alive.
any sign of Neal Daniels?
no.
Nicky, this is Pam Landy.
we have reason to believe there's a connection between NeaI Daniels and Jason Bourne.
Bourne? You're still looking for Bourne? I thought that case was closed.
no, some people are convinced he's still a threat.
I disagree, but to find out I need to talk to him.
hold on, Nicky.
what the hell are you doing? I'm trying to send him a message.
you don't think Bourne is a threat? He just took out two more of my men.
the only way this has a happy ending, Noah, is if we bring him in alive.
he is going after Daniels.
he wants revenge, Pam, and the only realistic way to end this is to eliminate the threat.
how long untiI backup?
Nicky, I need you to stay put and secure the premises.
backup will be arriving in approximately one hour. Do you copy?
copy, sir.
how long do I have?
three minutes.
my car's outside.
I know where Daniels is.
come on.
two minutes to destination, sir.
grab Teams A and B...
where was Daniels headed?
at 8: 00 this morning, he wired $100, 000 to a bank account in Tangier.
right, that's 300 miles away. If we hurry, we can make the morning ferry.
where are you parked?
to the right, 20 meters, north side of the street.
they're coming.
keep moving.
two subjects seen exiting safe house.
what the hell is this?
wait, wait, wait! No, no, no!
what the hell just happened?
we've lost visual contact with the subjects, sir.
Christ!
issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne, effective immediately.
send out a system one alert to all Spanish contacts.
I want all air and ground border exits locked down.
what's going on?
what's Daniels got?
what's Operation Blackbriar?
do you want to tell me, or should I call Kramer and ask him?
for Christ's sake, Pam, we're in the middle of an operation.
bullshit.
you want Jason Bourne, level with me.
operation Blackbriar started as an NEAT surveillance program.
and what is it now?
it is now the umbrella program for all our black ops.
full envelope intrusion, rendition, experimentaI interrogation is all run out of this office.
we are the sharp end of the stick now, Pam.
lethai action?
if we have to, sure.
that's what makes us special. No more red tape.
no more getting the bad guys caught in our sights, then watching them escape while we wait for someone in Washington to issue the order.
Oh, come on.
you've seen the raw inteI, Pam. You know how reaI the danger is.
we need these programs now.
what's the connection to Daniels?
he ran all of our operations in Southern Europe and North Africa, so he has everything.
names, dates, ghost sites, who's cooperating with us abroad.
every operation.
you want that stuff in Bourne's hands, out on the market to the highest bidder?
I don't think so.
Bourne's not after money. He's after Daniels for a reason.
well, what does it matter what Bourne is after?
when we find Daniels, and, believe me, we'll find him, if you're right, we get Bourne, too.
why did you come back?
why are you looking for Daniels?
do you know who that is?
that's Daniels.
I don't know who that is. Who is he?
he was there at the beginning.
I remember meeting him.
the first day.
Daniels brought me to him.
that's where it all started for me.
something happened to me and I need to know what it was or I'll never be free of this.
Daniels said the training was experimentaI.
behavior modification.
they had to break down the agents before they became operationaI.
he said you were the first one.
why are you helping me?
it was difficult for me
you really don't remember anything.
no.
we have to move.
sir? Mr. Wills? You're gonna want to look at this.
he's in Tangier.
Noah Vosen.
we have found Daniels.
they've just tracked Daniels' passport to a hoteI in Tangier.
they're holding up a bank transfer he made to keep him in place while they bring an asset up from Casablanca.
they're gonna take him out.
Yeah.
it's Pam Landy. She says it's urgent.
tell her I'm unavailable.
Yes, sir.
sir, asset has arrived at the airport.
give me the subject's location.
subject is now on foot and entering HoteI Velasquez.
hoteI is 2. 2 kilometers from the bank.
all right, get an elevation and a floor plan, tic-tac-toe.
locate the room.
give the asset subject location and the route between the subject's hoteI and the bank.
do we have that room yet?
Yes, sir. It's room 117.
all right, get a hold of the hoteI trunk line.
run all calls through here with an ISO on room 117.
his location's being blocked by the firewall.
no, they found Daniels. They know where he is.
they'll get one of the operatives to terminate him.
find out who.
Desh.
tell him you're gonna meet him and you have a new phone for him.
if you stop Desh, they'll just get someone else.
no, we're not gonna stop him, we're gonna follow him.
he'll take us right to Daniels.
sir, the asset is deviating off course.
let it play.
asset unscheduled stop.
sir, asset is on the move en route to subject.
sir, we have an unauthorized breach.
someone with active system knowledge penetrated our protocol.
instructions were sent to the asset at 1411 locaI time.
trace is confirmed and valid.
it came from a computer belonging to Nicky Parsons.
where did the course deviation occur?
south to Rue de Belgique, stationary Place de France.
that's where Parsons is.
when we're finished with Daniels, send the asset after her.
Yes, sir.
we find Parsons, we find Bourne.
Noah, what are you doing?
not now. I wanna know what's going on.
I said not now!
what basis are you continuing this operation on?
on the basis that Nicky Parsons has compromised a covert operation.
she is up to her neck in this!
this is about Daniels, not Nicky!
she has betrayed us.
you don't know the circumstances, Noah.
she's in league with Jason Bourne, for Christ's sakes!
you do not have the authority to kill her!
Oh, yes, I do. And you had better get on board.
Noah, she's one of us.
you start down this path, where does it end?
it ends when we've won.
when we're finished with Daniels, send the asset after them.
Yes, sir.
okay, come on. Stand by...
two minutes, sir. Two minutes.
tell the bank to release the funds.
Hello?
he's on the move.
on it, sir.
two hundred meters.
okay, come on, I want to lay in some preliminary tracking.
stop!
code it in. We need to be dead.
sir? Asset confirms both targets are down.
I want to be sure about this.
ask the station chief from Rabat to confirm the deaths and do a sub-rosa collection of the bodies.
I want to tie this thing off completely.
and keep an eye on Landy.
yeah?
Bourne and Nicky Parsons are dead.
you sure about that?
our station chief in Rabat is confirming.
I cant afford to have this come back to me.
don't worry. You're protected.
just remember why we put Landy there.
if Blackbriar goes south, well roll it up, hang it around her neck and start over.
I can see their faces.
everyone I ever killed.
I just don't know their names.
Marie used to try to help me remember the names.
I've tried to apologize for...
for what I've done.
for what I am.
none of it makes it any better.
they're gonna come for you again.
you're gonna have to run now.
we should go.
it gets easier.
station chief in Rabat just called.
they found a body.
Bourne? Desh.
Pam. You need to see this.
a passport for Gilberto de Piento just cleared immigration.
its an early Treadstone identity registered to Jason Bourne, but he never used it, and it never went to the grid.
Bournes alive.
they don't know?
well, if they knew, Vosen wouldnt be in his office right now.
its a hell of a risk.
maybe Bourne wants us to know.
just like NaPIes. Maybe he's communicating.
maybe he is trying to communicate with you.
then we should communicate back.
I think I know what Bournes looking for.
gilberto de Piento. Gilberto de Piento.
your Party is waiting for you.
Pamela Landy.
I hear you're still looking for me.
Bourne?
what do you want?
yeah?
better get in here. we got a situation.
I...
I wanted to thank you for the tape.
it's all tied off. It's over.
I guess I owe you an apology.
is that officiaI?
no. Off the record. You know how it is.
you tracing this?
fifty seconds to trace.
goodbye. Wait. Wait.
david Webb. That's your reaI name.
you were born 4/15/71 in Nixa, Missouri.
why don't you come in and we'll talk about it?
something is very wrong here.
Bourne?
get some rest, Pam.
you look tired.
he's looking right at her.
people, listen up!
this is a nationaI security emergency.
we have an imminent threat.
I'm going out there.
if I show myself, hell find me.
Jason Bourne is alive and is at large in New York City, and, we believe, within 1, 000 yards of this building.
I want an immediate 12-block lockdown of the area.
send a flash message to Langley.
prep for locaI backup assistance.
Landy just left the building!
stay with her phone.
she's using her cell. There's an incoming text.
get it. Working on it, sir.
how many do we have on Landy?
six men. More on the way.
I've got it, sir! Coming up on the screen now.
anybody not on Landy goes directly to Tudor City.
get the vehicles. We're going mobile.
team Two. Team Two. All teams, call in.
178th.
there's only one way out of there. Why would he do that?
hes trapping himself.
it's a bad place to meet. It's too exposed.
he wouldn't have chosen it if he didnt have a reason.
subject is en route.
roof 43, let me know when you have visuaI.
roof 43, standing by.
standing by.
okay, folks, here we go. Box 200 meters.
visuaI on leader.
43 ground in Position.
as soon as you have eyes on Landy, I wanna know.
okay, here we go.
copy that. I see her.
any sign of Bourne?
negative.
no sign of target.
Noah Vosen.
this is Jason Bourne.
I was wondering when you were going to make this call.
how did you get this number?
you didnt actually think I was coming to Tudor City, did you?
no, I guess not.
but if it's me you want to talk to, perhaps we can arrange a meet.
where are you now?
I'm sitting in my office.
I doubt that.
and why would you doubt that?
if you were in your office right now, we'd be having this conversation face to face.
this is a code ten abort.
I want everyone back in the vehicles. This is a code ten abort.
lets go! Lets go!
yeah?
wills, check my office.
damn it!
what's going on?
we need building security up here.
he's got everything. God damn it!
all right, set a four-block perimeter around the building.
somebody give me a visual.
I want the entire building searched.
every room, every hallway, every closet, every goddamn air duct.
you understand? I want him found!
what just happened?
Bourne just broke into CRI. He got into Vosens safe.
where to?
415 East 71st Street.
Four-fifteen-seventy-one? Jesus, Pam.
target in sight.
north on Eighth.
he's headed east in the Port Authority.
all agents have shoot-on-sight authorization.
right there!
sir, he drove off the roof. What?
he drove off the roof!
he's on foot. He's running.
police! Freeze!
put your hands in the air!
call for backup!
sir, sir, take a look at this! Bournes birthday, sir.
what about it? Check that out.
sir, Landy told Bourne that his birthday was 4I15I71.
Oh, my God. Its a code.
everything stops. Everything stops! Listen up!
4I15I71. New assignment, numbers.
what does it mean? Give me encryption codes!
sir, if you plug them in as variables of longitude and latitude you get Cameroon.
41571 is the zip code for Varney, Kentucky.
what date did she give him?
I don't believe it.
SRD is at 415 East 71st Street.
she just gave him the training facility.
Oh, Christ.
bring all the teams in behind us.
hurry up! Somebody call 911!
help him!
the asset lost Bourne. we lost him.
Hello? Albert, its Vosen.
Bourne knows everything and hes on his way to you right now.
he's coming home, Noah.
how long do I have?
I don't know.
just get the hell out of there.
no, I'm gonna stay.
he'll head for the training wing. That's what he knows.
ll'I keep him in play till you get there.
they'll kill you for giving me this.
4I15I71 isnt much of a code.
my guess is Vosen is on his way already.
why'd you do it?
because this isn't what I signed up for, what they did to you, Blackbriar.
this isnt us.
then do something about it. Everything you need is in there.
everything.
David. Why don't you come in with me?
it'll be better if we do this together.
no.
this is where it started for me.
this is where it ends.
that's Landy.
all right, lock this building down.
set a secure perimeter of one block.
hello. This is Pamela Landy. I have to send a classified document.
get a team to SRD after Bourne.
and put someone in every public area of this hospitaI.
okay. Elevator shafts, service entrances, go!
damn it! South bay! Go!
gentlemen, this is a priority one situation!
you will give us your full cooperation.
give me playback for the entire building for the last three minutes.
Yes, sir.
move! Move!
this one, here! Where is this?
first floor.
ll'l take Landy on my own.
you better get yourself a good lawyer.
a republic lives on the knife's edge.
when we are finished with you, you will no longer be David webb.
you may not even remember who he was.
you know why we're treating you like this?
Hello, Jason.
I believe you've been having some problems.
put the gun down.
I wouldnt be here if I didn't want to talk.
I've spent three years running.
three years trying to find out who I am.
you've still not got it all back, have you?
still not filled in the pieces.
it was always you.
I'm unarmed, Jason.
why me? Why did you pick me?
your really don't remember, do you?
we didnt pick you. You picked us.
you volunteered.
right here.
even after you were warned.
captain Webb.
good morning, Captain.
you came in here.
you didnt even blink, Jason.
you just handed me these.
has everything been explained to you?
Yes, sir.
you said you wanted to serve.
your missions will save American lives.
I understand, sir.
you said I'd be saving American lives.
you were.
I was killing for you.
for them.
you knew exactly what it meant for you if you chose to stay.
when we are finished with you, you will no longer be David Webb.
ll'I be whoever you need me to be, sir.
you can't outrun what you did, Jason.
you made yourself into who you are.
eventually You're gonna have to face the fact you chose right here to become Jason Bourne.
you haven't slept for a long time.
have you made a decision?
this can't go on.
you have to decide.
who is he?
we've been through that.
what did he do?
it doesn't matter.
you came to us.
you volunteered.
you said youd do anything it takes to save American lives.
you're not a liar, are you?
or too weak to see this through?
this is it.
let go of David Webb.
really give yourself to this program.
you're no longer
david Webb.
from now on, you'll be known as Jason Bourne.
welcome to the program.
do you remember now?
I remember.
I remember everything.
I'm no longer Jason Bourne.
so now You're gonna kill me.
no.
you don't deserve the star they'd give you on the wall at Langley.
he's headed for the roof!
why didnt you take the shot?
do you even know why you're supposed to kill me?
look at us.
look at what they make you give.
good morning, senators.
if I may, Id like to begin by making a statement for the record.
the file indicates that Ezra Kramer authorized six illegaI...
the President convened an emergency cabinet meeting today to discuss the growing scandaI over an alleged government assassination Program, code-named Blackbriar.
CIA Director Ezra Kramer is under criminal investigation for authorizing the Program, which in several cases may have even targeted US citizens.
two agency officials have already been arrested.
Dr. Albert Hirsch, the alleged mastermind of Blackbriar Program and CIA DePuty Director Noah Vosen, the Program's oPerationaI chief.
meanwhile, mystery surrounds the fate of David webb, also known as Jason Bourne, the source behind the exPosure of the Blackbriar Program.
it's been reported that webb was shot and fell from a Manhattan rooftop into the East River ten stories below.
however, after a three-day search, webb's body has yet to be found.
the Invisible
it wasn't easy...
when Nick's father died, raising a teenager alone.
but, with a boy like Nick, well, he is now everything a mother could want.
we've been through some hard times.
we've carried each other.
now I look to the future, and I know there's nothing that we can't do together.
thank you.
go on, open it.
turn it over.
to Nick, from Mother. Make me proud.
so, to us.
to us, all.
Cheers.
around the table.
you look pale.
how would you know?
are you taking the Valerian Root I got you?
mom... - Finals are next week.
mom?
what?
have you... thought about it?
about what? - The writer's course?
London? - I don't need to think about it.
you know how I feel. Why do we keep bringing this up?
what is that?
irony? Irony?
what's up, dude?
you got it?
Thanks, man.
you just saved my ass.
pleasure doing business with you.
you want to know what it says?
when am I going to speak French?
Hey, caught you.
are you coming to Ava's party tomorrow?
I can't. I'm busy.
busy? School's almost out.
whatever.
come on.
what's he got? - Nothing.
not a dime.
unbelievable.
NIC gum.
and a pack.
you wearing the patch, too?
kind of a mixed message, Pete.
like the fact that you accepted merchandise from me...
and still haven't paid for it.
I'll get your money, please!
got money for this crap, but not for me?
no, please! I'll get your money! Please!
don't be such a baby. It's just a scratch.
see you soon.
she sits up and cries
a sigh
long thighs
gotta fly
love you, baby a lie
Why?
Jimmy, you wrote that?
Yes, ma'am.
OK, then. Thanks.
Nicholas, let's see if you can top that.
please.
it still needs some work.
it always needs work, get used to it.
day burns down to night
burns the edge of my soul
in the night
I break into sparks of suns
and become fire's end the dust of bones
night knifes my breath swallows whole my tongue
turn back reverse return
in the night I see the real concealed in the day's bright lie
eyes stitched shut
white teeth smile
sleep walks
and talks and feet mark time...
OK, I know it's party week, but it's finals, too.
Hey.
Hey. Don't look at me like that. I needed a new phone.
so go buy one at RadioShack.
are you serious? You know my dad.
he gives me no cash. - You gotta stand up for yourself, man.
don't let them push you around like that.
that's easy for you to say, because when you talk, people listen.
when I talk, you listen. That's about it.
I can't, man. OK? I can't.
Hey, Nick, come on. Dude, stop it, stop.
come on, Nick.
damn it.
OK...
how much does my friend owe you?
is that enough?
disappear, asshole.
you are so broken.
what are you looking at?
no. Nothing. I'm just more of a grover guy, that's all.
you're so polite.
the whole "golden boy" thing, right?
except it's not really you. I mean, I know you sell essays.
you're no better than me.
you're right. I'm a total hypocrite.
anybody want to explain?
she finds me irresistible.
all right. Newton, I'm not gonna suspend you. I know the game.
just go home today, be back here tomorrow.
try decaf.
what are you doing, Nick?
wasting your time on a lost soul like Annie Newton?
she has no future. You do.
don't let us down.
can I leave now?
Hey, Annie.
Where's dinner?
Hey, Victor. Are you hungry?
see?
get your bony ass out of this chair right now and make him something to eat.
you can't talk to me like that.
I just did.
just gonna leave? - What do you want? I got night shift.
say something to her.
it's a little food. You got nothing else to do all day.
you wanna fight, then? Is that what you want to do?
Yeah. - You wanna get into this now?
discipline your kids, for God's sake.
you don't tell me what to do.
take some responsibility for your kids.
why won't you talk to her?
my main responsibility...
Annie, you going out tonight?
Annie? Annie!
you're leaving?
later. I'll be back.
I'll be back.
Hey.
it's from Seb and Tash.
they need those translations by tomorrow morning.
Yeah, they're done.
so, you got beat up by a girl. - Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.
Yeah, don't want to talk about it, huh?
so, are we gonna go to Ava's party tomorrow night?
party.
I'm not gonna be here tomorrow night.
ticket and baggage information.
London? - Yeah.
the Royal Academy writer's program.
Really?
no, you're graduating next week, you can't go.
I have enough credits to graduate. - Oh, my God.
London?
London? - Yeah.
wait, does your mom know? - No.
but she will, when I'm gone.
she just... she won't get it. You know, she doesn't get it.
Yeah. - There's no other way.
do you remember when my dad died?
the first thing that she said to me was, "Don't worry about it, Nick. This won't change a thing for you.
you know, I'm like, 13, right. All I wanna do is cry.
she's thinking about my future?
she's always had it mapped out.
you know, I stay here, I might as well retire and die.
I mean, my dad didn't even get to retire.
he was 46 when he got sick.
I'm not gonna let her do that to me.
Hey, baby girl.
you ready?
always.
hey...
Hey! Don't even think about it, all right?
they're still inside, that's why they haven't cleared the window.
hey... hey, what the hell are you doing?
no, no. Annie, no!
goddamn it, Annie!
goddamn it.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Yeah, nice work, Annie.
you always expect me to just stand around?
you're getting more and more out of control.
what time is it? - Go back to sleep.
leave the bag. I'll take care of it. - Sure you will.
you gonna shop it around at school? It's not like cell phones.
what, I can't make a little money on the side?
what for? College?
I'll figure it out.
leave the bag.
what are you gonna do, Marcus? - Leave the bag, Annie.
nothing.
nothing?
Hey, I'm talking to you.
don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you!
nothing?
nothing. Nothing.
police Department. Can I help you?
Marcus? Marcus!
Marcus. - They found the stuff. I got busted.
what did you tell them? - Nothing. You think I'm an idiot?
police Department. How may I direct your call?
I'm out on OR. I got a court date in a couple weeks.
any idea how they found out? - Yeah. An idea.
I'll take care of it myself.
Hey, Nick? - Yeah?
I wanna leave, too, man. - Why?
Why? Why?
cause I'd be the foreigner. I'd be American, I have the accent.
what are you gonna do in London?
I'll be a cricket star. You know, those dudes with mallets?
I think that's polo. - I'd be a polo star.
you didn't have money to afford a cell phone, how are you gonna get a ticket?
you have a passport? - No.
I need someone to write to, man.
OK. All right. Good luck.
I love you, man.
I love you, too.
take care of yourself, man.
don't look back, baby. - Don't look back.
the airline called.
your flight's been changed.
I can explain, Mom. - Can you?
can you, really?
I tried to talk to you. - Why bother?
you've had this ticket for weeks.
you were planning to go no matter what I said.
my God, Nicholas.
you were just going to leave tonight without saying a word?
I feel like I've been living in this house with a stranger.
I swear I didn't do it, OK?
you were watching me.
it wasn't me.
you were watching me by the lockers.
I didn't do it. - Then who did?
I don't know, I swear, I don't know!
please stop!
no, no!
get back here. - No! No! Don't!
how's your hand, Pete? How's your hand, Pete!
huh?
OK!
I'll tell you, OK?
I'll tell you!
thought you were too busy to come.
you wanna go to London?
you wanna go to London?
seriously.
flight leaves in two hours.
then we'd better hurry up.
what would she think of us right now?
your mom.
hmm?
Wow.
that's a nice watch.
so why are you still wearing that beat up, old thing?
my dad gave it to me.
wouldn't he want you to have a better watch?
it was my dad's.
what are you doing?
have a good time.
Hey, where you off to?
come on, man. You gonna fight back?
I can't watch this.
please, tell them to stop.
shut up. - Please, tell them to stop.
please, tell them to stop.
think you're so smart?
gonna cry? Why don't you cry?
come on, you little baby. Look at me!
get the hell up!
come on, man. Fight back.
get off.
no.
how do you like that? - Stop it!
do you feel good about yourself now? Now that you turned me in, huh?
I didn't know... you were supposed to be on a plane, Nick!
he can't hear you, idiot.
you're so damn perfect.
Annie, Annie. That's enough. Look at him.
stop. Just stop. - Get off of me!
who's the broken one, now? - You are.
it's still you.
come on, come on.
still you.
What'd you say? - Still you.
What'd you...?
Oh, jeez.
he's not breathing. - Aw, man!
what the hell, Annie! What did you do that for?
what did you do? What did you do? - Shut up. Shut up!
what did you do? - I am not going to jail for this!
Oh! - Now we have to pick him up.
I'm not picking him up. - Pick him up!
just keep moving.
we gotta get further into the woods.
we know, we got it! - Just come.
just keep moving.
come on, get in here.
open up.
open up! - Oh, Christ.
what the hell happened to you?
I killed him.
what did you say?
I killed him. - Killed who?
nicholas Powell, the kid who sold me out.
it got all screwed up. What am I gonna do?
why the hell did you come here, Annie?
Jesus Christ! You know I'm on parole, Annie!
why'd you come here?
I need an alibi, Marcus.
what did I say to you, huh?
you're way out of control.
you should've listened to me. Now get out.
get out!
don't touch that.
stolen.
stolen...
stolen, stolen, stolen.
stolen, stolen...
stolen!
I knew I could count on you.
guess you didn't use the ticket, huh?
I don't even know where he went.
see, they return.
Ah, see the tentative movements and the slow feet
trouble in the pace and the uncertain wavering
anyone?
come on, guys. We did this poem three days ago.
Ezra Pound? - No one?
Hello?
it's Ezra Pound, The Return. - No one?
Ezra Pound. You guys are killing me.
OK. Discussion.
poems we heard in last class.
Jimmy. - Nick Powell's poem.
I mean, I didn't get it. How does sleep talk?
it's a metaphor. - It doesn't even rhyme.
what's your problem? - It's pretentious.
Nick's always trying to make himself important.
I think Powell has serious issues.
whatever, it sucked. - I liked it.
is this a game?
you guys playing a game? Think this is funny?
Hello!
anybody?
Hello!
Hello! Hello!
Hello? Hello! Can anybody hear me?
Hey, guys. Guys.
let's talk about this when Nick gets back to class, shall we?
come on, Mom, answer the phone.
answer the phone.
Oh, I'm sorry. I just had to use the phone.
Hello?
nicholas Powell?
no, he must be in class right now, Mrs. Powell.
Yeah, just a minute. I'll have someone go check if he's here.
hold on, please.
I'm sorry, detective, what was that?
mom... can you hear me? - He left the house last night at 7: 00.
he's never stayed out all night without calling me.
I just... I have a bad feeling about this.
mom!
Hello, hello!
Hello? - Oh, thank God.
is that better? Can you hear me?
I said 18 year old, white male, name's Nicholas Powell.
possible missing persons case.
what are you looking for, detective?
my son is missing and you're in here.
what exactly are you doing?
looking for anything to help find Nick.
I mean, I could fill out a report, give it 24 hours, but...
that's not what I do...
not when a kid's involved.
I don't know.
you know if Nick used drugs or sold them?
no. Of course not.
what can you tell me about him?
he's very well liked. He's bright. He's very bright.
he's very bright.
I mean, who is he, really?
you have my number if there's anything.
detective?
I found a plane ticket for London.
did you call the airline? - He missed the flight.
he wasn't on it.
I wouldn't worry too much, Mrs. Powell.
he's only been gone the one night.
no. Something is wrong.
he... he wouldn't. I know him.
you didn't know about the plane ticket.
mom. I'm dead.
we need to get a search party up here.
comb these woods. - Yeah, I spoke with the principal.
Nick had a run in yesterday with a girl at school.
sorry. Newton. Annie Newton.
something I should know?
Jack.
we're here to talk to Annie.
she's on the roof.
some history there?
he used to be a cop.
what happened?
it's a long story.
I knew Annie when she was just a baby.
she liked my ties.
Hey, kiddo. What's up?
what do you want now?
nice. You know, you asked me to marry you once.
another lifetime.
I guess so.
what did you do last night, Annie?
I don't remember. - She was busy cracking my skull.
happen to run into Nicholas Powell?
who? - Why not ask her why she killed me.
we know you had a problem with him. - Do I know you?
someone called to turn you in yesterday.
you knew that. Think it was Nicholas?
what? - I was with my boyfriend, Marcus.
Marcus know this? - Ask him.
they found something by the woods. Putting together a search party, so...
so... I have some homework to do.
you'll have to excuse me.
I'll let you get to it. - Mm-hmm.
no more questions? You bought that?
I can't believe this.
you killed me because you thought I called the police on you?
was she a sweet baby? - Everybody has a story.
you bitch!
be careful, you'll break it.
why can't I fly it on the roof? - Because it's not safe.
don't pretend you're a human being. - Come on, please.
I'll take you to the park sometime. The one by the bluffs?
when? - Sometime.
I'm just a little busy right now. - Hey, Annie.
what's gonna happen to you? - Nothing to worry about, little man.
Hey, Pete. There's a search party in the woods. I want you there.
I don't care.
Oh, my God, this is a nightmare.
shit!
go slowly, keep together, pay attention.
if you find something, call one of the officers.
try not to disturb the area.
OK. Let's get to it.
set your radios on channel three.
tell them to go south. - Nicholas!
Nick!
Nicholas!
Nick Powell!
Nick!
Nick Powell! Can you hear us?
Nick!
day burns down to night
burns the edge of my soul
in the night I break into sparks of suns
and become fire's end
the dust of bones
in the night I see the real concealed in the day's bright lie
eyes stitched shut
white teeth smile
sleep walks
and talks
Oh, jeez.
I'm alive.
shit. I'm alive.
Nick Powell!
Nick!
Nick! - Here! I'm right here!
Hey, I'm over here!
here I am, right here. Come here, boy.
good boy.
come here, come here, buddy. This way, come here.
good boy!
good boy! - Hey, wait. You see me, don't you?
come here.
good boy, come here. Good boy. - Nicholas!
to Nicholas, From Mother." Got something here!
good boy, you can see me, yeah!
no, no! Wrong way!
that way! I think he's onto something. - No! Wait, don't go!
Nick!
Nicholas!
Pete.
why was Annie calling you?
they'll find him.
it just takes some time, you know? I mean, I...
I was literally right there when they found the watch.
you were right there and they didn't find the body.
nobody knows but us, so?
what are you so afraid of?
I can't take this. I'm going to the police.
you go to the police, you go to jail.
no.
I won't. It was you.
you were right there and you didn't do a thing.
you're in as deep as we are.
Pete, I'm still alive out there.
Pete...
Pete!
they know you did it and they'll keep coming back.
don't think you can run, Annie, 'cause they'll get you.
Hey, Annie.
I have to go away for a little while.
are you gonna go away and never come back, like Mom?
go on, Annie, tell him.
here.
I want you to keep this for me. - I don't want it.
it was Mom's - I know.
you need it more than I do.
you're pretty great. - Yeah, I know.
come here, little man.
do you know what I want more than anything?
don't be like me.
OK?
one day, if I'm lucky, maybe I'll get to do one good thing.
make you proud of me.
how'd you get in here?
everybody's out there looking for you.
you listening to me?
I want you out of here. - No problem. I'm gone.
just know...
if anything happens to Victor...
I will come back here, and I will kill you.
whatever you've done, I want no part of it.
so, your mom's gone, your dad married somebody else, you all hate each other, does that give you an excuse?
does that make it oK?
well, you know what?
don't think about blaming anyone but yourself.
Annie, this is your fault!
goddamn it, Annie! I'm still alive!
tell them where my body is!
Oh, that's right! You can't hear me.
you can't hear me, Annie.
Burnaby Police are not offering any information at this point.
we do know forensics are on the scene.
however, night has fallen and with rain in the city...
what's our time frame if he's out there alive?
it depends on his injuries. I'd say two, three days, tops.
all right.
nice shop. - We're closed, man.
you only work on the old cars? - No.
what about you work on, say, an '03?
sure thing, man. Come back tomorrow, I'll sort you out, all right?
Hey, I know you. You're Marcus Bohem.
you go out with Annie Newton, right?
Yeah, that's right.
you seen her lately?
no. Well, I see her sometimes.
hmm. Open relationship.
you see her on Tuesday night? - Yeah, I was with her.
school night. - Yeah.
because Monday night she got busted for a smash-and-grab at a jewelry store.
you know, and they took a car the same time.
and so, you weren't with her that night?
I don't know anything about that. - Good. That's good.
no, but she phoned you from the police station.
right, but I wasn't with her that night, you see?
OK.
how long has it been?
hmm.
I've been on parole eight months with a clean record.
you can check with my PO. - I already did.
OK.
you see Annie, you tell her I want to talk to her.
about a missing person at her school.
know anything about it?
no.
2003 Mercedes S500.
car that got stolen.
keep an eye out for me.
don't worry about it, Mom.
this won't change a thing for you.
you got everything all under control, right?
you always had your... your fingers in everything.
you know, fingering through this house.
me, my room.
don't! Don't feel a thing, Mom!
you don't want to ruin your face, your pretty face!
I'm out there in the mud!
I'm dying, Mom, and you're sitting here with your briefs and your herbal tea and your books!
I wish you could see me right now, Mom!
so you know how sick I am of you!
I am sick of you and your perfect world!
I am sick of you 'cause it's not perfect, you hear me?
Oh, Nicky. Oh!
shut up, Pete.
did you know you were being followed by the police?
who are you?
did you know that you were being followed by the police?
no. - Well, you are.
you're coming with me. - Where are we going?
you wonder why I'm angry.
stomping through the forest in the middle of the night, freezing cold, in the mud, with my good boots on.
get up, come on.
cause you guys are sloppy, you don't think.
I gotta clean up your mess or it's gonna be on me.
you weren't there. - Doesn't matter.
any of you go down, you'll take me with you, I know it.
I can't let you do that. Where you going?
he's in there.
Annie, it's me. We gotta meet. It's Matty.
he says he's going to the cops.
where are you? - I got him at the bridge.
keep him there, I'll be right over.
she's coming.
all right. You guys did the right thing.
man, what're you gonna do? - What am I gonna do?
what do you think I'm gonna do? She's out of control, man.
I need you to do something for me. - Look, you gotta leave me alone.
Dean and Matty are up to something, meet them at the bridge.
no. I can't take this anymore, OK?
you wanna go missing, too?
Hey, hey hey! Wake up!
please, pay attention!
Oh, my God.
go, go, go, go! Come on, fly! Fly!
thank you.
what the hell are you doing here? Where's Annie?
she says you have to talk to me. - What? Oh, shit.
Hey, baby girl.
this is not right.
go home.
we've gotta get out of here.
there's a tail on him. - There's just no loyalty these days.
shut your mouth. You need to learn to shut your mouth.
or someone's gonna shut it for you.
and who would that be, Marcus? You?
Marcus, the cops.
Annie! - Drop the gun, Annie.
drop it now! - Put the gun down.
hold your fire.
put the gun down!
Annie, stop!
Annie! Annie!
Annie, stop!
nice.
come on, Annie, where's Nicholas? Just give it up.
they'll catch you, Annie!
Never!
Never!
she heard me.
she heard me! You heard me!
baby girl, where'd you get this? - It was Marcus's.
one fifty. - It's worth ten times that.
it's worth twenty times that.
but, word is, you're in trouble and I'm in business, so...
one fifty.
two hundred. - I just need a roof right now.
go on, disappear.
I'm sorry.
I saw your face that night, Annie.
and I think right then, you would've traded places with me.
you know, sometimes I wish my mom was dead.
instead of my dad.
I always did what she wanted.
you know, and I never even argued.
you know, maybe if I was a little more like you, we both wouldn't be here.
I'm sorry.
Annie.
I know you can hear me.
just tell them where my body is.
I'm dying, Annie.
I don't have much time left and you're the only one that can save my life.
how messed up is that?
Annie!
Annie.
clear this stuff out of the way.
come on, quit fooling around. Let's go.
why are we here, Annie?
there's no time.
there you are.
I remember you.
you were always so scrubbed.
you were in Miss Vogel's class?
she was such a bitch. - She was such a bitch.
that was fourth of July weekend.
thirteen years old.
that's the last thing I ever did with my dad.
my mom used to take me there.
come on. Hurry, Annie. Come on.
come on.
no. No.
Pete. Pete was here.
Annie. Annie, somebody was here to move my body.
who moved my body? Think, Annie. Think.
it's there, it's right there.
come on, Annie. It's right there.
come on, Annie.
hang on, Nick.
you're doing a great job, decorating committee.
good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
as you all know...
as most of... No...
as most of you probably know, this week has been a tough one.
Where's Nick? - Don't know what you're talking about.
don't start, Pete. Just tell her. - Answer me!
answer me!
you know what's really screwed up about this whole thing?
Nick didn't do it. - What the hell are you saying?
Nick didn't turn you in.
you're lying. - No, I lied.
I thought he left town, I lied to save my ass.
you're lying. - You know what?
I didn't do it, either. - What are you talking about?
you killed Nick for nothing.
nothing. - You're lying.
Jesus, man. - Then don't believe me.
Where's the body? - Where'd you put the body?
I know you couldn't do it alone. Who helped you?
who helped you?
Marcus.
Marcus?
Marcus. - What's going on here?
little cozy, don't you think?
miss me, baby boy?
get out. I said get out. - What?
where you gonna shoot me? Outside a cop shop, baby girl?
if you want. Or, you can drive.
OK, I'll drive.
Pete, what are you doing, man?
keep walking.
I didn't say stop.
you're not doing this. - On your knees.
on your knees!
all right.
Pete, no! Pete!
what are you doing, Pete?
you don't need to do this, I'm still alive!
God, you're my last chance! Pete, please!
trust me, this isn't the answer!
if you die, I die, Pete!
Pete, please! This is not the way out!
it was you. You called the police on me.
Nick was innocent, I hurt him for nothing.
Yeah, well, that was your choice, wasn't it?
Yeah, so is this.
Jesus Christ.
Pete, wake up! Stay with me, come on!
Nick?
this is really weird.
Pete, where'd you move my body to?
Pete, please. - Where'd you move the body?
what does it matter, Annie?
he's dead. - No, he isn't!
I saw him, I looked into his eyes.
he's not dead! - How do you know?
I just know, oK? - Come on, Pete.
I screwed things up. - I know. I know, Pete...
you're the only friend I had. - I know, where's my body?
for the last time, where is he?
Where'd you move the body?
in the ruins by the dam. I'm so sorry, Nick.
Peter! - I'm so sorry, please.
Peter? - Nick?
you want the body? You'd better hurry, baby.
that water's gonna wash him away. - Have a nice life.
Hey, Annie?
Larson. - You don't have to look for me anymore.
Annie? - I can tell you where Nick is.
he's still alive. I just need you to do one thing for me.
I left something for my brother.
it's in my locker at school.
make sure he gets it, please.
I'll take care of it.
Nick's at the Broward Dam.
OK. - What is it?
the dam gates open in 15 minutes. - So, what are you saying?
anything downstream of it will be flooded out.
how much time we got? - We don't.
help me!
help!
somebody help me! Help!
we don't have minutes. We have to cut the flow. Now!
save me!
help!
help me!
keep looking.
I want you to look everywhere.
there! There he is!
come on. - Let's go! See if he's alive.
he's alive, I got a pulse.
no response? Got it. - Gotta get some fluids in him now.
get him up there as quick as we can.
Nick.
got it. - C-collar on.
got it. - C-collar on.
you get the rhythm? - Very slight.
Mrs. Powell? This is Detective Tunney. We found Nick.
he's alive.
we need to get bags in him. - Shut down.
I've got no IV access on that side. - Damn it.
I got no pulse.
he's in V-Tach, charge the paddles. He's in V-Tach, charge the paddles.
clear! Clear!
charge 300. - Charging.
clear.
charge to 360. - Charging.
everything all right? - Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just tired.
I'm gonna have to ask you to step out of the car.
no. I have to be somewhere.
ma'am! Ma'am!
teenage male found down rescued from the base of a dam, unconscious...
Nicholas?
let me be with my son. - The team will do everything we can.
he needs me, he needs me. - We will do everything we can.
now, please.
get out of the car, put your hands on your head.
Annie, I need you.
I need you, Annie. - Turn off the engine.
get out of the car, hands on your head now!
and what was the status when we found him?
Annie.
this way.
I just got word a nurse spotted a girl matching Annie's description.
stop! Stop.
what?
nothing.
OK, go.
hurry.
I'm right here.
I'm in here.
you have some nerve.
no, Mom. No.
I just need to talk to him.
talk? He can't talk, thanks to you.
you should hate me. - Hate you? Yes.
I do. I hate you.
excuse me. - Don't.
please, don't.
I can't ask you to forgive me.
stop it, Mom, stop it!
it's oK, she loves you.
what did you say?
tell her that I'm here.
I don't know how to say this, but... - Just tell her.
he's here.
Nick. - Don't.
don't you talk about my son.
you have to make her listen to you.
you have to make her listen.
I can feel him here.
everywhere.
I can even hear him. I know what he wants.
I don't believe you.
tell her that she was in my room.
you were in his room.
after I disappeared.
after he was gone. - What are you doing?
you read one of my poems, for the first time.
I was there, Mom.
I watched you.
I read it with you.
and you couldn't even finish it.
you were hurting too much, and I see that now.
I never understood what you were going through after Dad died.
how Ionely you felt.
but, I'm still here, Mom.
and you have to believe that.
I'm here.
I'm here.
what do you want?
what do you want?
I need to see him, just for a minute.
no. - I can help him.
no. - Please.
I don't know why, but, I'm supposed to be here. but, I'm supposed to be here.
I can bring him back.
I'm so sorry, Nick.
I didn't see you before.
I didn't know you.
I wish I could take it all back.
Nick.
Annie.
please.
don't go.
Annie. I'm here.
I'm right here.
Nick.
Annie.
I see you.
I see you.
Nick...
I wanted to do one good thing.
you did, Annie.
you did.
you saved me.
you saved me.
I like your plane.
what is it? - Dragonfly 220.
Yeah.
should you be out here alone?
where are your parents? - They don't know I'm here.
my sister was supposed to bring me. - But she didn't?
she died.
think we should send her a message?
how?
what should we say?
it's your message.
Hey, Annie...
Hey, Annie.
that's it. - That's it?
...especially to curse with.
you see? It's like wiping your ass with silk. I love it.
you know why we are here.
I am a trafficker of information. I know everything I can.
the question is, do you know why you are here?
we are looking for the Keymaker.
Oh, yes, it is true. The Keymaker, of course.
but this is not a reason, this is not a why.
the Keymaker himself, his very nature, is a means, it is not an end.
and so to look for him is to be looking for a means to do...
...what? -You know the answer to that question.
but do you?
you think you do, but you do not.
you are here because you were sent here.
you were told to come here, and then you obeyed.
it is, of course, the way of all things.
you see, there is only one constant...
...one universal. It is the only real truth.
causality.
action, reaction.
cause and effect. -Everything begins with choice.
no. Wrong.
choice is an illusion created between those with power...
...and those without.
look there at that woman.
my God, just look at her...
...affecting everyone around her.
so obvious, so bourgeois, so boring. But wait.
watch. You see, I have sent her a dessert...
...a very special dessert.
I wrote it myself.
it starts so simply...
...each line of the program creating a new effect, just like...
...poetry.
first...
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.
you can see it, Neo, yes?
she does not understand why.
is it the wine? No.
what is it then? What is the reason?
and soon it does not matter.
soon the why and the reason are gone...
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.
and this is the nature of the universe.
we struggle against it, we fight to deny it...
...but it is, of course, pretense. It is a lie.
beneath our poised appearance...
...the truth is, we are completely...
...out of control.
causality. There is no escape from it. We are forever slaves to it.
our only hope, our only peace, is to understand it, to understand the why.
Why" is what separates us from them...
...you from me.
Why" is the only real source of power. Without it, you are powerless.
and this is how you come to me, without why, without power.
another link in the chain.
but fear not.
since I have seen how good you are at following orders...
...I will tell you what to do next.
run back and give the fortuneteller this message:
her time is almost up.
now I have some real business to do, so I will say adieu and goodbye.
this isn't over. -Oh, yes, it is.
the Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason why I should give him up.
no reason at all. -Where are you going?
please, ma cherie, I have told you. We are all victims of causality.
I drank too much wine, I must take a piss.
cause and effect. Au revoir.
touch me and that hand will never touch anything again.
well, that didn't go so well.
are you certain the Oracle didn't say anything else?
Yes. -Maybe we did something wrong.
or didn't do something.
no, what happened couldn't have happened any other way.
how do you know? -We are still alive.
if you want the Keymaker, follow me.
get out.
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit. On and on. Pompous prick.
a long time ago, when we first came here, it was so different.
he was so different.
he was like you.
I'll give you what you want, but you have to give me something.
what? -A kiss.
excuse me?
I want you to kiss me as if you were kissing her.
Why? -You love her. She loves you.
it's all over you both.
a long time ago, I knew what that felt like.
I want to remember it. I want to sample it. That's all.
just a sample.
why don't you sample this instead? -Trinity.
such emotion over something so small. It's just a kiss.
why should we trust you?
if I don't deliver you to the Keymaker, she can kill me.
all right.
but you have to make me believe I am her.
all right.
terrible. Forget it.
wait.
okay.
Yes.
that's it.
I envy you. But such a thing is not meant to last.
come with me.
not again.
it's all right, boys. They're with me.
these fellas work for my husband.
they do his dirty work. They're very good, very loyal.
aren't you, boys?
Yes, mistress.
they come from a much older version of the Matrix.
but like so many back then, they caused more problems than they solved.
my husband saved them because they're notoriously difficult to terminate.
how many people keep silver bullets in their gun?
you can either run and tell my husband what I have done...
...or you can stay there and die.
he's in the ladies' room!
hurry.
my name is Neo. -Yes. I'm the Keymaker.
I've been waiting for you.
my God! My God, Persephone, how could you do this? You betray me.
cause and effect, my love. -Cause?
there is no cause for this. What cause?
what cause? How about the lipstick you're still wearing?
lipstick? Lipstick.
what craziness are you talking about, woman? There is no lipstick!
she wasn't kissing your face, my love.
woman, this is nothing.
lt is a game. It is only a game. -So is this.
have fun.
all right.
all right.
let us find out where this goes.
you two, get the Keymaker.
that's a nice trick.
I cannot go back.
I'll handle them.
handle us? You'll handle us? You know, your predecessors had much more respect.
okay, you have some skill.
kill him.
you see? He's just a man.
goddamn it, woman, you will be the end of me.
mark my words, boy, and mark them well.
I have survived your predecessors, and I will survive you.
where are you going? -Another way. Always another way.
close it, quick!
could we move along?
run!
step away from the door.
we owe you for that.
just like new.
drop your weapon.
stay with him. -What about Neo?
he can handle himself.
get in back.
shit.
operator. -Link, where am l?
you won't believe this, but you're way up in the mountains.
Really? -lt'll take me a while to get an exit.
shit! -What?
the twins are after Morpheus and Trinity. They don't have a way out.
where are they? -Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.
operator. -Get us out of here.
won 't be easy. -I know. We're inside the core network.
the only exit I got near you is the Winslow overpass.
off the freeway. - Yes, sir.
fine, we'll make it. -I should-- Oh, shit! Look out behind you!
lncoming fire. -Down!
hold on!
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly real fast.
are you watching this, Link?
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you. Eight units headed your way.
any suggestions?
turn right. -Right, now.
straight here. You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.
got it. -You sure about this? The freeway, I mean.
ln 14 years of operating, I've never seen-- -Link, what did I tell you?
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.
I'll be ready for you. -Good man.
you always told me to stay off the freeway.
Yes, that's true. -You said it was suicide.
then let us hope...
...that I was wrong.
operator. -Link, it's Niobe.
we've been sent to bring you in.
I need to talk to Morpheus. -Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.
where is he? -Just follow the sirens.
repeat, they're approaching the
we have them now. -The exile is the primary target.
move!
we are getting aggravated. -Yes, we are.
Trinity.
get him out of here.
come on!
crush him.
Morpheus.
he's okay. Keep moving.
let's go.
I need a download to hot-wire a motorcycle.
no problem. One crash course on motorcycle
wait.
cancel that.
you are handy.
jump on.
she means nothing.
find the exile. -We have them.
get down.
gotcha.
she's good.
you are no longer necessary.
we do only what we're meant to do.
then you are meant for one more thing: deletion.
go kick his ass.
Neo, if you're out there, I could use some help.
what is that?
Yes! Yes!
we have confirmation from the lcarus. First two ships are in position for counterattack.
good.
any change?
they hit some iron ore here. Slowed them down a little.
how much? -An hour, maybe.
that would give them a little over nine hours.
Yes, sir.
there is a building.
inside this building, there is a level where no elevator can go...
...and no stair can reach.
this level is filled with doors. These doors lead to many places.
hidden places.
but one door is special.
one door leads to the source.
this building is protected by a very secure system.
every alarm triggers the bomb. -Bomb? Did he say bomb?
but like all systems, it has a weakness.
the system is based on the rules of a building.
one system built on another. -Electricity.
lf one fails, so must the other. -No electricity, no alarms.
you'd have to take out a city block to kill the power.
not one, 27. -Twenty-seven blocks?
there is a power station.
it must be destroyed.
there must be some kind of fail-safe. -Yes, there is an emergency system.
the core network of the grid must be accessed.
the emergency system must be deactivated.
what do you need us for?
Neo could take them out easier than we could.
there's no time. -Why?
once the door is unprotected, the connection will be severed.
but another connection must first be made.
how long will that take? -Exactly 314 seconds.
just over five minutes.
that is the length and breadth of the window.
only the One can open the door, and only during that window can the door be opened.
how do you know all this?
I know because I must know. It is my purpose.
it's the reason I'm here, the same reason we're all here.
Neo, I know something's wrong.
you don't have to tell me.
I just want you to know that I'm here.
all must be done as one.
can't hurt.
if one fails...
...all fail.
at midnight, there is a shift change in the security of both buildings.
at midnight, we will strike.
you count sheep at home. -Why? I get paid to count them here.
okay, they're inside.
how much time? -Twelve minutes.
Oh, shit.
all of our lives, we have fought this war. Tonight, I believe we can end it.
tonight is not an accident.
there are no accidents.
we have not come here by chance. I do not believe in chance.
when I see three objectives, three captains, three ships...
...I do not see coincidence. I see providence.
I see purpose.
I believe it is our fate to be here. It is our destiny.
I believe this night holds for each and every one of us...
...the very meaning of our lives.
I want to ask you to do something, but I don't know how.
I promise you, if I can, I will.
what if I asked you to stay out of this...
...no matter what...
...to stay out of the Matrix?
Why?
please.
all right.
what is it, Niobe?
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't help thinking, what if you're wrong?
what if all this, the prophecy, everything, is bullshit?
then tomorrow we may all be dead.
but how would that be different from any other day?
this is a war, and we are soldiers.
death can come for us at any time...
...in any place.
incoming. Incoming!
incoming!
now consider the alternative.
what if I am right? What if the prophecy is true?
what if tomorrow the war could be over?
isn't that worth fighting for?
isn't that worth dying for?
time? -Three minutes.
almost there.
it is done.
find the others.
I got Niobe there. They're out of the station.
what about Soren? -There.
they're still inside, but...
they're not moving.
that's it, let's go.
call Neo now.
I lost them. They're inside the portal. -What about the grid?
everything is operational. The emergency system is rerouting power.
Jesus.
soon as they open that door, it's all over.
the hell it is.
what are you--? Trinity!
I will not wait and do nothing. I will not watch them die.
we're talking less than five minutes.
in five minutes, I'll tear that building down.
how much further? -Here, just here.
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.
it's gotta be the ugliest hack I have ever done.
that's as close as I can get you. You better grow wings.
operator. -I'm in.
keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.
you look surprised to see me again, Mr. Anderson.
well, that's the difference between us. I have been expecting you.
what do you want, Smith? -You haven't figured that out?
still using all the muscles except the one that matters.
I want exactly what you want.
I want everything.
would that include a bullet from this gun?
go ahead, shoot.
the best thing about being me, there's so many me's.
Christ! What the hell happened in here?
hold it right there, little lady.
if you can't beat us...
join us.
Morpheus!
still no sight of them. They only got two minutes left.
one minute.
come on.
come on.
please.
kill them.
they're in.
I don't believe it.
it was meant to be.
Morpheus, that door will take you home.
you will know which door. Hurry, Neo.
Trinity, I got some serious activity headed your way.
Hello, Neo.
who are you? -I am the Architect.
I created the Matrix. I've been waiting for you.
you have many questions. Though the process has altered your consciousness...
...you remain irrevocably human.
ergo, some of my answers you will understand and some you will not.
Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent...
...you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant.
why am I here?
your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation...
...inherent to the programming of the Matrix.
you are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts...
...I've been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise...
...a harmony of mathematical precision.
while it remains a burden assiduously avoided...
...it is not unexpected and thus not beyond a measure of control...
...which has led you, inexorably...
...here.
you haven't answered my question. -Quite right.
interesting. That was quicker than the others.
others? How many? What others?
the Matrix is older than you know.
I count from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next.
in which case, this is the sixth version.
five before me? He's lying. Bullshit.
there are only two possible explanations. There were five before me.
either no one told me...
...or no one knows. -Precisely.
as you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic...
...creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.
you can 't control me! I'm gonna smash you to bits!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
you can 't make me do anything. You old, white prick!
choice.
the problem is choice.
the first Matrix I designed was naturally perfect, a work of art.
flawless, sublime.
a triumph equaled only by its monumental failure.
the inevitability of its doom is apparent now...
...as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human.
thus, I redesigned it based on your history...
...to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature.
however, I was again frustrated by failure.
I have come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind.
or perhaps, a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection.
thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program...
...initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche.
if I am the father of the Matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.
the Oracle. -Please.
as I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...
...accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice...
...even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level.
while this answer functioned, it was fundamentally flawed...
...thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly...
...that, if left unchecked, might threaten the system.
ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked...
...would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.
this is about Zion.
you are here because Zion is about to be destroyed.
its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.
bullshit.
denial is the most predictable of all human responses.
but rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it...
...and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.
the function of the One...
...is now to return to the source, allowing a dissemination of the code you carry...
...reinserting the prime program.
after which you will be required to select from the Matrix 23 individuals...
...sixteen female, seven male, to rebuild Zion.
failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash...
...killing everyone connected to the Matrix...
...which, coupled with the extermination of Zion...
...will result in the extinction of the entire human race.
you won't let it happen. You can't. You need human beings to survive.
there are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.
the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready...
...to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.
it is interesting reading your reactions.
your five predecessors were, by design, based on a similar predication...
...a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment...
...to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the One.
while the others experience this in a general way, your experience is far more specific...
...vis-a-vis love.
Trinity!
apropos, she entered the Matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.
no.
which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...
...is ultimately expressed and the anomaly revealed...
...as both beginning and end.
there are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source and the salvation of Zion.
the door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her and the end of your species.
as you adequately put, the problem is choice.
but we already know what you are going to do, don't we?
already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal...
...the onset of an emotion designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.
an emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth:
she is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it.
hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously...
...the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.
if I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.
we won't.
we got a serious situation, sir.
Oh, no.
what was that? -It's moving faster than anything I've seen.
holy shit, he caught her.
Neo, I had to.
I know.
the bullet is still inside.
Trinity...
...don't you quit on me now.
I'm sorry.
Trinity.
Trinity...
...I know you can hear me.
I'm not letting go.
I can't.
I love you too damn much.
I can't take this.
I guess this makes us even.
I don't understand it.
everything was done as it was supposed to be done.
once the One reaches the source, the war should be over.
ln 24 hours, it will be. -What?
if we don't do something in 24 hours, Zion will be destroyed.
what? -How do you know that?
I was told it would happen. -By whom?
it doesn't matter. I believed him.
that's impossible. The prophecy tells us-- -lt was a lie, Morpheus.
the prophecy was a lie.
the One was never meant to end anything.
it was all another system of control.
I don't believe that.
but you said it yourself.
how can the prophecy be true if the war isn't over?
I'm sorry.
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...
...I swear to you it's the truth.
what are we gonna do? -I don't know.
Oh, no!
what are they doing? -They're just out of EMP range.
it's a bomb.
we have to get out of here. Now.
I have dreamed a dream...
...but now that dream has gone from me.
here they come.
let's go, Morpheus.
we won't make it. -We have to try.
come on! -Something's different.
what?
I can feel them.
Neo!
what happened? -I don't know.
it's the Hammer.
he's in some kind of coma...
...but his vitals are stable.
what about you?
I'm fine.
you could use some rest.
no, I'm gonna stay with him.
lock was right. He guessed that the machines...
...would cut off the mainlines in and out of Zion.
he thought a counterattack might surprise them.
it sounded good. I figured we had a shot...
...until someone screwed it up.
an EMP was triggered before we got in position.
five ships were instantly downed. -When the machines broke through...
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.
was it an accident? Some sort of malfunction?
no one knows. -Someone does.
who?
once the machines were done with us, they started digging again.
we made a quick pass to look for survivors. -You found one?
only one.
everything that has a beginning...
...has an end.
I see the end coming.
I see the darkness spreading. I see death.
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.
we missed you.
it ends tonight.
you are all that stands in his way.
if you cannot stop him tonight, then I fear that tomorrow may never come.
Mr. Dufresne, describe...
...the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.
it was very bitter.
she said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around.
and she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.
what was your response? - I told her I would not grant one.
I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno.
those were your words, according to your neighbors.
if they say so.
I really don't remember. I was upset.
what happened after you argued with your wife?
she packed a bag.
she packed a bag to go and stay with Mr. Quentin.
glenn Quentin, golf pro at the Snowden Hills Country Club...
... whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.
did you follow her?
I went to a few bars first.
later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home.
I parked in the turnout... ... and waited.
with what intention?
I'm not sure.
I was confused... ... drunk.
I think... ... mostly I wanted to scare them.
when they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.
I was sobering up.
I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.
along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.
I've been very clear on this point.
I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning...
...and finds your wife in bed with her lover...
...riddled with. 38-caliber bullets.
does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?
Yes, it does.
yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river... ...before the murders took place.
that's very convenient.
it's the truth.
the police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found...
...so no comparison could be made between your gun and the bullets...
...Taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.
and that also is very convenient. Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?
since I am innocent of this crime...
...I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.
ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.
we have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have footprints.
bullets on the ground bearing his fingerprints.
a broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.
and most of all...
... We have a beautiful young woman and her lover lying dead in each other's arms.
they had sinned.
but was their crime so great as to merit a death sentence?
while you think about that think about this
a revolver holds six bullets, not eight.
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.
that at least could be understood, if not condoned.
no.
this was revenge of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature. Consider this:
four bullets per victim.
not six shots fired, but eight.
that means that he fired the gun empty and then stopped to reload so that he could shoot each of them again.
an extra bullet per lover right in the head.
you strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.
it chills my blood just to look at you.
by the power vested in me by the state of Maine I hereby order you to serve two life sentences back-to-back...
...one for each of your victims. So be it!
sit.
we see you've served 20 years of a life sentence?
Yes, sir. - You feel you've been rehabilitated?
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.
I mean, I learned my lesson.
I can honestly say that I'm a changed man.
I'm no longer a danger to society.
that's God's honest truth.
Hey, Red.
how'd it go?
same old shit, different day.
Yeah, I know how you feel.
I'm up for rejection next week.
Yeah, I got rejected last week.
it happens.
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.
get out of my face, man! You're into me for five packs already.
four!
there must be a con like me in every prison in America.
I'm the guy who can get it for you.
cigarettes, a bag of reefer, if that's your thing bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation.
damn near anything within reason.
Yes, sir! I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.
so when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...
... I told him, "No problem."
everybody to front door mouth set
to front door mouth set
Andy came to Shawshank Prison in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was banging.
on the outside, he'd been vice president of a large Portland bank.
good work for a man so young.
red
you speak English, butt-steak?
you follow this officer.
I never seen such a sorry-Iooking heap of maggot shit in all my life.
Hey, fish! Come over here!
taking bets today, Red?
smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.
smokes. Put me down for two.
all right, who's your horse?
that little sack of shit.
eighth. He'll be first. - Bullshit! I'll take that action.
you're out some smokes, son.
if you're so smart, you call it.
I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.
the fifth one. Put me down for a quarter deck.
fresh fish today!
we're reeling them in!
I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him.
looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.
that was my first impression of the man.
what do you say?
that tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass.
that guy? Never happen.
10 cigarettes. - That's a rich bet.
who's going to prove me wrong?
Heywood? Jigger?
Skeets?
Floyd!
four brave souls.
return to your cellblocks for evening count.
all prisoners, return to your cellblocks.
turn to the right!
eyes front.
this is Mr. Hadley. He's captain of the guards.
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.
you are convicted felons.
that's why they've sent you to me.
rule number one:
no blasphemy.
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison.
the other rules...
...you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions?
when do we eat?
you eat when we say you eat.
you shit when we say you shit, and piss when we say you piss.
you got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?
on your feet.
I believe in two things:
discipline and the Bible.
here, you'll receive both.
put your trust in the Lord.
your ass belongs to me.
welcome to Shawshank.
unhook them.
turn around.
that's enough.
move to the end of the cage.
turn around. Delouse him.
turn around.
move out of the cage. Pick up your clothes and Bible.
next man up!
to the right.
right. Right.
left.
the first night's the toughest. No doubt about it.
they march you in naked as the day you were born...
... skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit.
and when they put you in that cell and those bars slam home that's when you know it's for real.
old life blown away in the blink of an eye.
nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.
most new fish come close to madness the first night.
somebody always breaks down crying.
happens every time.
the only question is who's it going to be?
it's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.
lights out!
I remember my first night.
seems like a long time ago.
Hey, fish.
fish, fish.
what are you, scared of the dark?
bet you wish your daddy never dicked your mama!
piggy! Pork! I want me a pork chop.
the boys always go fishing with first-timers.
and they don't quit till they reel someone in.
Hey, Fat Ass.
fat Ass!
talk to me, boy.
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.
don't you listen to these nitwits, you hear me?
this place ain't so bad.
tell you what I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home.
I know a couple of big old bull queers that'd just Iove to make your acquaintance.
especially that big, white, mushy butt of yours.
God!
I don't belong here!
we have a winner! - I want to go home!
and it's Fat Ass by a nose!
fresh fish!
I do not belong to here
I want to go home!
I want my mother!
I had your mother! She wasn't that great!
what the Christ is this horseshit?
he blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.
you'll tell him with my baton up your ass! Let me out!
what is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?
please! I ain't supposed to be here.
not me!
I won't count to three. Not even to one.
you shut up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!
shut up, man. Shut up!
you don't understand. I'm not supposed to be here.
open that cell.
me neither! They run this place like a fucking prison!
son of a bitch!
captain, take it easy!
if I hear so much as a mouse fart in here tonight...
...I swear by God and Jesus, you will all visit the infirmary.
every last motherfucker in here.
call the trustees. Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.
his first night in the joint, Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.
he never made a sound.
tier 3 north, clear count!
tier 2 north, clear count.
tier 3 south, clear count.
tier 1 north, clear count.
tier 4 north, clear count.
prepare to roll out.
roll out!
are you going to eat that?
I hadn't planned on it.
do you mind?
that's nice and ripe.
Jake says thank you.
fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.
I'm going to look after him until he's big enough to fly.
Oh, no! Here he comes.
morning, fellas.
fine morning, isn't it?
you know why it's a fine morning, don't you?
send them down. I want them lined up...
...just like a pretty little chorus line.
look at that.
I can't stand this guy. - Oh, Lord!
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.
smell my ass!
after he smells mine.
that's a shame about your horse coming in last and all.
but I sure do love that winning horse of mine, though.
I owe that boy a big kiss when I see him.
why don't you give him some of your cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!
Hey, Tyrell.
you pull infirmary duty this week?
how's my horse doing anyway?
dead.
hadley busted his head up pretty good.
doc had gone home for the night.
poor bastard lay there till this morning.
by then, there wasn't nothing we could do.
what was his name?
What'd you say?
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.
what the fuck do you care, new fish?
doesn't fucking matter what his name was. He's dead.
anybody come at you yet?
anybody get to you yet?
Hey, we all need friends in here.
I could be a friend to you.
hard to get.
I like that.
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.
I guess he had a lot on his mind trying to adapt to life on the inside.
wasn't until a month went by before he opened his mouth to say more than two words to somebody.
as it turned out that somebody was me.
I'm Andy Dufresne.
Wife-killing banker.
why'd you do it?
I didn't, since you ask.
you're going to fit right in.
everybody in here's innocent. Didn't you know that?
what you in here for? - Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.
rumor has it you're a real cold fish.
you think your shit smells sweeter than most. Is that right?
what do you think?
to tell you the truth, I haven't made up my mind.
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time.
I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
what?
a rock hammer.
what is it and why? - What do you care?
for a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask. I'd quote a price.
but a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't it?
fair enough.
a rock hammer is about six or seven inches long.
looks like a miniature pickax. - Pickax?
for rocks.
quartz?
quartz
and some mica, shale，limestone.
so?
so I'm a rock hound.
at least I was in my old life. I'd like to be again.
or maybe you'd like to sink your toy into somebody's skull.
no, I have no enemies here.
no? Wait a while.
word gets around.
the Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.
especially Bogs.
don't suppose it would help if I told them I'm not homosexual.
neither are they.
you have to be human first. They don't qualify.
bull queers take by force. That's all they want or understand.
if I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.
thanks for the advice. - Well, that's free.
you understand my concern.
if there's trouble, I won't use the rock hammer.
then I'd guess you want to escape. Tunnel under the wall, maybe.
what did I miss? What's so funny?
you'll understand when you see the rock hammer.
what's an item like this usually go for?
seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.
my normal markup's 20 percent.
but this is a specialty item.
risk goes up, price goes up. Let's make it an even 10 bucks.
ten it is.
waste of money, if you ask me.
Why's that?
folks around this joint love surprise inspections.
they find it, you're going to lose it.
if they catch you, you don't know me.
mention my name, we never do business again.
not for shoelaces or a stick of gum. Now you got that?
I understand.
thank you, Mr...
red.
name's Red.
red
why do they call you that?
maybe it's because I'm Irish.
I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.
he had a quiet way about him a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.
he strolled like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world.
like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.
yes
I think it'd be fair to say...
... I liked Andy from the start.
let's go! Some of us got a schedule to keep.
move it! Come on, move it!
how you doing? How's the wife treating you?
continues
continues
red
Andy was right.
I finally got the joke.
it would take a man about 600 years to tunnel under the wall with one of these.
book? - Not today.
book?
Brooks
delivery for Dufresne.
wants the book?
wants the book?
here's your book.
Thanks.
we're running low on hexite. Get on back and fetch us up some.
this will blind you.
honey, hush.
that's it. You fight!
better that way.
I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight and the Sisters let him be.
I wish I could tell you that but prison is no fairy-tale world.
he never said who did it.
but we all knew.
things went on like that for a while.
prison life consists of routine and then more routine.
every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.
the Sisters kept at him.
sometimes he was able to fight them off.
sometimes not.
and that's how it went for Andy.
that was his routine.
I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.
and I also believe that if things had gone on that way this place would have got the best of him.
but then, in the spring of 1949 the powers that be decided:
the roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing.
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.
as you know special detail carries with it special privileges.
it was outdoor detail and May is one damned fine month to be working outdoors.
stay in line there.
more than a hundred men volunteered for the job.
Wallace E. Unger.
Ellis Redding.
wouldn't you know it?
me and some fellows I know were among the names called.
andrew Dufresne.
it only cost us a pack of smokes per man.
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.
so this big-shot lawyer calls me long-distance from Texas.
I say, "Yeah?
he says, "Sorry to inform you, but your brother just died.
I'm sorry to hear that. - I'm not. He was an asshole.
ran off years ago. Figured him for dead.
so this lawyer fellow says to me:
"he died a rich man. Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks."
a million bucks?
incredible how lucky some assholes get. - You going to see any of that?
thirty-five thousand. That's what he left me.
dollars?
that's great! That's like winning the sweepstakes.
isn't it?
dumb shit, what do you think the government will do to me?
take a big wet bite out of my ass is what.
poor Byron.
terrible fucking luck, huh? Crying shame.
some people really got it awful.
Andy, are you nuts?
keep your eyes on your mop, man!
you'll pay some tax, but you'll still end up...
Yeah, maybe enough to buy a new car, and then what?
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair maintenance, kids pestering you to take them for a ride all the time.
then if you figure your tax wrong, you pay out of your own pocket.
I tell you! Uncle Sam!
he puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple.
Andy, Andy - Getting himself killed. - Keep tarring.
some brother. Shit!
Mr. Hadley，do you trust your wife?
Oh, that's funny.
you'll look funnier sucking my dick with no teeth.
what I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back?
step aside, Mert. This fucker's having himself an accident.
he'll push him off!
if you trust her, you can keep that 35000.
what did you say? - Thirty-five thousand.
all of it.
every penny. - You better start making sense.
if you want to keep it, give it to your wife.
the IRS allows a one-time-only gift to your spouse for up to $ 60000.
bullshit. Tax-free? - Tax-free.
IRS can't touch one cent.
you're that smart banker that killed his wife.
why should I believe you? So I can end up in here with you?
it's legal. Ask the IRS. They'll say the same thing.
I feel stupid telling you this. I'm sure you would have investigated.
I don't need you to tell me where the bear shit in the buckwheat.
of course not. But you do need someone to set it up for you.
that'll cost you. A lawyer.
a bunch of ball-washing bastards!
I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money.
you get the forms, I'll prepare them nearly free of charge.
I'd only ask three beers apiece for each of my coworkers.
coworkers. That's rich!
a man working outdoors feels more like a man if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion，sir.
what are you jimmies staring at?
let's go! Work!
and that's how it came to pass that on the second-to-last day of the job
... the convict crew that tarred the factory roof in the spring of '49 wound up sitting in a row at 10: 00 in the morning...
...Drinking icy-cold beer, courtesy of the hardest screw...
... That ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.
drink up while it's cold, ladies.
the colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.
we sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.
we could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses.
we were the lords of all creation.
as for Andy...
... He spent that break hunkered in the shade...
... A strange little smile on his face...
... Watching us drink his beer.
want a cold one?
no, thanks. I gave up drinking.
you could argue he done it to curry favor with the guards.
or maybe make a few friends among us cons.
me?
I think he did it just to feel normal again...
... If only for a short while.
king me.
chess. Now there's a game of kings. - What?
civilized. Strategic.
and a total fucking mystery. I hate it.
let me teach you someday.
sure.
we could get a board together.
you're talking to the right man. I can get things, right?
we might do business on a board, and I'll carve the pieces myself.
one side in alabaster, one in soapstone. What do you think?
I think it'll take years.
years I got. What I don't have are the rocks.
pickings are pretty slim in the yard.
pebbles, mostly.
we're getting to be kind of friends, aren't we?
Yeah, I guess.
can I ask you something?
why'd you do it?
I'm innocent, Red.
just like everybody else here.
what are you in for?
murder. Same as you.
innocent?
only guilty man in Shawshank.
Where's the canary?
how did you know?
how did I know what? - So you don't know.
come.
this is where the canary is.
quite a surprise to hear a woman singing in my house, eh?
that's quite a surprise.
red
wait, wait.
here she comes.
I like this part when she does that shit with her hair.
I know. I've seen it three times this month.
Gilda, are you decent?
me?
God, I love it.
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. What do you want?
Rita Hayworth. - What?
can you get her?
so this is Johnny Farrel. I've heard a lot about you.
take a few weeks. - Weeks?
I don't have her stuffed down the front of my pants right now, sorry to say.
but I'll get her.
relax.
Thanks.
indeed, you should introduce to visit him
you said what I do make?
no, I must let him be pleasantly surprised
calming down, Farrel - Get out! - I got to change reels!
I said fuck off!
ain't you going to scream?
let's get this over with.
he broke my fucking nose!
now...
...I'm going to open my fly...
...and you'll swallow what I give you to swallow.
then you'll swallow Rooster's. You broke his nose.
he ought to have something to show for it.
you put it in my mouth, you lose it.
no, you don't understand.
do that and I'll put all eight inches of this in your ear.
all right, but you should know that sudden, serious brain injury...
...Causes the victim to bite down hard.
in fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong...
...they have to pry the victim's jaws open...
...with a crowbar.
where do you get this shit?
I read it.
you know how to read, you ignorant fuck?
honey!
you shouldn't!
bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth.
and neither did his friends.
what they did do is beat him within an inch of his life.
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.
bogs spent a week in the hole.
time's up, Bogs.
it's your world, boss.
return to your cellblocks for evening count.
all prisoners report for lock down.
what?
Where's he going? - Grab his ankles.
no... Help!
two things never happened again after that.
the Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again.
and Bogs would never walk again.
they transferred him to a minimum-security hospital upstate.
to my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days...
... Drinking his food through a straw.
Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary.
sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.
the man likes to play chess.
let's get him some rocks.
guys!
I got one.
I got one. Look!
heywood, that isn't soapstone! And it ain't alabaster either.
what are you, a fucking geologist?
he's right. It ain't.
what the hell is it then? - It's a horse apple.
bullshit! - No, horseshit.
petrified.
God
Damn!
despite a few hitches, the boys came through in fine style.
and by the weekend he was due back...
... We had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till rapture.
also got a big shipment in that week.
cigarettes...
... Chewing gum...
... Sipping whisky...
... Playing cards with naked ladies on them. You name it.
and of course, the most important item:
Rita Hayworth herself.
everybody awakes
heads up. They're tossing cells.
heads up. They're tossing cells!

on your feet.
face the wall.
turn around and face the warden.
pleased to see you reading this.
any favorite passages?
watch ye, therefore, for ye know not...
...when the master of the house cometh.
mark 13: 35.
I've always liked that one.
but I prefer...
..." I am the light of the world."
ye that followeth me shall have the light of life.
John, chapter 8, verse 12.
I hear you're good with numbers.
how nice.
man should have a skill.
explain this.
it's called a rock blanket. It's for shaping and polishing rocks.
a little hobby of mine.
it's pretty clean.
some contraband here, but nothing to get in a twist over.
I can't say I approve of this.
but I suppose...
...Exceptions can be made.
lock them up!
I almost forgot.
I'd hate to deprive you of this.
salvation lies within.
Yes, sir.
tossing cells was just an excuse.
truth is Norton wanted to size Andy up.
my wife made that in church group.
very nice, sir.
you enjoy working the laundry?
no, sir. Not especially.
perhaps we can find something more befitting a man of your education.
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?
I thought I heard you out here.
I've been reassigned to you.
I know, they told me.
ain't that a kick in the head?
well, I'll give you the dime tour.
come on.
well, here she is.
the Shawshank Prison Library.
national Geographics...
...Reader's Digest condensed books...
...and Louis L'Amour.
look magazine.
Erle Stanley Gardners.
every evening I load up the cart and make my rounds.
I enter the names on this clipboard here.
easy, peasy, Japanese-y.
any questions? - How long have you been librarian?
I come here in '05, and they made me librarian in 1912.
and have you ever had an assistant?
no. Not much to it, really.
why me? Why now?
I don't know.
but it'd be nice to have some company down here.
Dufresne
that's him. That's the one.
I'm Dekins.
I was thinking about setting up some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.
I see.
why don't we have a seat and talk it over.
do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?
Thanks.
so...
mister Dekins...
and then Andy says, 、 Mr. Dekins...
...do you want your sons to go to Harvard or Yale?
he didn't say that!
as God as my witness!
Dekins blinked for a second...
...then he laughed and actually shook Andy's hand.
my ass! - Shook his hand.
I tell you, I near soiled myself!
all he needed was a suit and tie and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...
...He'd have been "Mr. Dufresne," if you please.
making a few friends?
I wouldn't say "friends.
I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.
it's a wonderful pet to have.
got you out of the laundry, though.
it might do more than that.
how about expanding the library. Get some new books.
if you ask for something, ask for a pool table.
right
how do you expect to do that? I mean...
...get new books in here, Mr. Dufresne, if you please.
I'll ask the warden for funds.
six wardens have been through here in my tenure, and I've learned...
...one immutable, universal truth:
not one born whose asshole...
...Wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you ask for funds.
the budget's stretched thin as it is. - I see.
maybe I could write the state senate and request funds from them.
they have only three ways to spend the taxpayers' money for prisons:
more walls, more bars, more guards.
I'd like to try, with permission. A letter a week.
they can't ignore me forever. - Sure can.
but you write your letters if it makes you happy.
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?
so Andy started writing a letter a week just like he said.
and like Norton said Andy got no answers.
the following April, he did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.
year after that, he did them all including the warden's.
year after that, they rescheduled the intramural season to coincide with tax season.
the guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2s.
so Moresby Prison issued you a gun but you paid for it.
right. The holster too.
that's tax-deductible. You can write that off.
Yes, sir! Andy was a regular cottage industry.
in fact, it got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.
could you hand me a stack of 1040s?
got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.
and still, he kept sending those letters.
red, Andy, It's Brooks.
watch the door.
please, Brooks.
calm the fuck down. - Stay back!
stay back, goddamn it! - What's going on?
one second he's fine, then out come the knives.
we can talk about this, right?
there's nothing to talk about. I'll cut his fucking throat.
what's he done to you?
it's what they done!
I got no choice.
you won't hurt Heywood. We all know that.
right, Heywood? - Sure.
he's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.
right, guys?
so put the knife down. Look at me.
put the knife down.
look at his neck, for God's sake.
look at his neck. He's bleeding.
it's the only way they'd let me stay.
this is crazy. You don't want to do this.
put it, put it down.
take it easy.
you'll be all right.
him? What about me?
crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!
you've had worse from shaving.
what did you do to set him off?
nothing. I come in here to say farewell.
ain't you heard? His parole's come through.
I just don't understand what happened in there.
old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.
that's enough out of you.
heard he had you shitting your pants. - Fuck you.
IKnock it off.
Brooks ain't no bug.
he is only...
he's just institutionalized.
institutionalized, my ass.
the man's been in here 50 years, Heywood, 50 years!
this is all he knows.
in here, he's an important man...
...an educated man.
outside, he's nothing.
just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.
probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.
you know what I'm trying to say?
I do believe you're talking out of your ass.
you believe whatever you want.
but I tell you these walls are funny.
first you hate them.
then you get used to them.
enough time passes...
...you get so you depend on them.
that's "institutionalized.
shit.
I could never get like that. - Oh, yeah?
wait till you've been here as long as Brooks.
goddamn right.
they send you here for life...
...that's exactly what they take.
part that counts, anyway.
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.
you go on now.
you're free.
you're free.
good luck, Brooksie.
taking care
dear fellas:
I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.
watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?
I saw an automobile once when I was a kid...
...but now they're everywhere.
the world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.
the parole board got me into this halfway house...
... called "The Brewer..."
... and a job...
... Bagging groceries at the Food-Way.
it's hard work and I try to keep up...
... But my hands hurt most of the time.
make sure your man double-bags.
last time, the bottom near came out.
make sure you double-bag like the lady says. Understand?
Yes, sir. Surely will.
I don't think the store manager likes me very much.
sometimes after work, I go to the park and feed the birds.
I keep thinking...
... Jake might just show up and say hello.
but he never does.
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.
I have trouble sleeping at night.
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.
I wake up scared.
sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.
maybe I should get a gun and rob the Food-Way so they'd send me home.
I could shoot the manager while I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.
I don't like it here.
I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided...
...not to stay.
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...
... Not for an old crook like me.
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss, not for an old crook like me.
P. S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.
no hard feelings. Brooks.
he should have died in here.
what the fuck have you done?
it's a goddamn mess, I'll tell you that.
what's all this? - You tell me. They're addressed to you.
take it.
dear Mr. Dufresne:
in response to your inquiries...
...the state has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project.
this is $ 200.
in addition, the library district has generously responded...
...with a donation of used books and sundries.
we trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed.
please stop sending us letters.
clear all this out before the warden gets back.
Yes, sir.
good for you, Andy.
Wow!
it only took six years.
from now on, I'll write two letters a week instead of one.
I believe you're crazy enough. Get this stuff out...
...like he said. I've got to pinch a loaf.
when I come back...
...this is all gone, all right?
do you hear that?
Dufresne!
Andy, let me out!
Andy
I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.
truth is, I don't want to know.
some things are best left unsaid.
I like to think it was something so beautiful...
... It can't be expressed in words...
... And makes your heart ache because of it.
I tell you, those voices soared...
... Higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.
it was like a beautiful bird flapped into our drab cage and made those walls dissolve away.
and for the briefest of moments every last man at Shawshank felt free.
it pissed the warden off something awful.
open the door.
open it up!
Dufresne, open this door!
turn that off!
I am warning you. Turn that off!
Dufresne
you're mine now.
Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.
on your feet.
Hey, look who's here. - Maestro!
you couldn't play something good, huh? Like Hank Williams?
they broke the door down before I could take requests.
was it worth two weeks? - Easiest time I ever did.
no such thing as easy time in the hole. - A week in the hole is like a year.
damn straight. - I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.
so they let you tote that record player down there, huh?
it was in here.
in here.
that's the beauty of music. They can't get that from you.
haven't you ever felt that way about music?
well, I played a mean harmonica as a younger man.
lost interest in it, though.
didn't make much sense in here.
here's where it makes the most sense.
you need it so you don't forget.
forget?
forget that there are...
...Places...
...in the world that aren't made out of stone.
there's something...
...Inside...
...that they can't get to...
...that they can't touch.
that's yours.
what are you talking about?
hope.
hope.
let me tell you something, my friend.
hope is a dangerous thing.
hope can drive a man insane.
it's got no use on the inside.
you'd better get used to that idea.
like Brooks did?
sit down.
says here that you've served 30 years of a life sentence.
you feel you've been rehabilitated?
Oh, yes, sir.
without a doubt.
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.
no danger to society here.
God's honest truth.
absolutely rehabilitated.
thirty years.
Jesus, when you say it like that...
you wonder where it went.
I wonder where 10 years went.
here.
a little parole rejection present.
go ahead and open it.
went through one of your competitors.
I hope you don't mind. I wanted it to be a surprise.
it's very pretty.
thank you.
you going to play it?
no.
not right now.
roll in!
lights out!
Andy was as good as his word.
he wrote two letters a week instead of one.
in 1959, the state senate finally clued in to the fact they couldn't buy him off with just a $ 200 check.
appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of $500 just to shut him up.
and you'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it.
he made deals with book clubs, charity groups.
he bought remaindered books by the pound...
treasure Island.
robert Louis...
Stevenson.
fiction, adventure.
what's next?
I got here Auto Repair and Soap Carving.
trade skills and hobbies. Under "Educational," behind you.
count of Monte Crisco.
that's "Cristo," you dumb shit.
by Alexandree Dum-ass.
dumb ass.
dumb ass?
Dumas. IKnow what that's about?
you'd like it. It's about a prison break.
we ought to file that under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?
the rest of us did our best to pitch in when and where we could.
by the year Kennedy was shot...
... Andy had transformed a storage room smelling of turpentine into the best prison library in New England complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.
that was also when Warden Norton instituted his famous "Inside Out" program.
you may remember reading about it.
it made the papers and got his picture in Look magazine.
it's no free ride but rather a genuine progressive advance in corrections and rehabilitation.
our inmates, properly supervised will be put to work outside these walls performing all manner of public service.
these men can learn the value of an honest day's labor and provide a service to the community...
...At a bare minimum of expense to Mr. And Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.
of course he didn't tell the press that "bare minimum of expense" is a fairly loose term.
there are 100 different ways to skim off the top.
men, materials, you name it.
and oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in!
at this rate, you'll put me out of business.
with this pool of slave labor, you can underbid any contractor in town.
we're providing a valuable community service.
that's fine for the papers, but I've got a family to feed.
we go back a long way.
I need this highway contract. I don't get it and I go under. That's a fact.
you have some of this fine pie my missus made for you. You think about that.
I wouldn't worry too much about this contract.
I already got my boys committed elsewhere.
you be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.
and behind every shady deal...
... Behind every dollar earned...
... There was Andy, keeping the books.
two deposits.
Maine National and New England First. Night drops as always, sir.
get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
if they over-starch my shirts again, they'll hear from me.
how do I look?
very nice. - Big charity to-do up Portland way. - Governor will be there.
you want the rest of this?
woman can't bake worth shit.
thank you, sir.
he's got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.
he's got scams you haven't even dreamed of. IKickbacks on his kickbacks.
a river of dirty money running through here.
sooner or later, he'll have to explain where it came from.
that's where I come in.
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.
stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.
I send it out into the real world, and when it comes back...
clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh? - Cleaner.
by the time Norton retires, I'll have made him a millionaire.
if they ever catch on, he'll wind up in here wearing a number himself.
I thought you had more faith in me than that.
I know you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail.
now anybody gets curious, FBI, IRS...
...Whatever.
it'll lead to somebody.
sure it is, but not to me, and certainly not to the warden.
all right, who?
Randall Stevens.
who?
the "silent" silent partner.
he's the guilty one, the man with the bank accounts.
it's where the filtering process starts.
they trace anything, it'll just lead to him.
but who is he?
he's a phantom, an apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.
I conjured him out of thin air.
he doesn't exist, except on paper.
you can't just make a person up.
sure you can, if you know how the system works.
it's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate, driver's license, social security.
you're shitting me.
if they trace any accounts, they'll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination.
well, I'll be damned!
did I say you were good?
shit, you are Rembrandt.
the funny thing is on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow.
I had to come to prison to be a crook.
ever bother you?
I don't run the scams. I just process the profits.
a fine line, maybe...
...but I also built that library and used it to help guys get their high school diploma.
why do you think he lets me do all that?
keep you happy and doing the laundry.
money instead of sheets.
well, I work cheap. That's the tradeoff.
Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965...
... On a two-year stretch for B and E.
that's breaking and entering to you.
cops caught him sneaking TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney.
young punk.
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...
... Cocky as hell.
come on, old boys. Moving like molasses!
making me look bad.
we liked him immediately.
I'm backing out the door and I got the TV like this.
a big old thing. I couldn't see shit. Then I hear this voice.
freeze, kid, hands in the air.
I was standing there, holding onto that TV. Finally the voice says:
you hear what I said, boy? I say, Yes, sir. I did.
but if I drop this, you get me on destruction of property too.
you done some stretch in Cashman, right?
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time, let me tell you.
weekend furloughs. Work programs.
not like here.
sounds like you done time all over.
I've been in and out since I was 13.
name it, chances are I've been there.
perhaps you should try a new profession.
what I mean is you're not a very good thief. You should try something else.
Yeah, what the hell you know about it, Capone?
what are you in for?
me?
a lawyer fucked me.
everybody's innocent in here. Don't you know that?
as it turned out, Tommy had himself a young wife and a new baby girl.
maybe he thought of them on the streets or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.
whatever it was something lit a fire under that boy's ass.
thought I might try for my high school equivalency.
hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.
I ain't no goddamn loser.
you mean that? - Yeah.
you really mean that?
Yes, sir, I do.
good. Because if we do this...
...we do it all the way, a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.
thing is, see I don't read so good.
well.
you don't read so well.
we'll get to that.
so Andy took Tommy under his wing.
started walking him through his ABC's.
Tommy took to it pretty well too.
boy found brains he never knew he had.
before long, Andy started him on his course requirements.
he really liked the kid.
gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shit heap.
but that wasn't the only reason.
prison time is slow time.
so you do what you can to keep going.
some fellas collect stamps.
others build matchstick houses.
Andy built a library.
now he needed a new project.
Tommy was it.
it was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks.
the same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.
in prison...
... A man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.
by 1966, right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams...
... It was lovely Raquel.
time.
well?
well, it's for shit.
I wasted a whole year of my time with this bullshit.
it's probably not that bad.
I didn't get a thing right. It might as well have been in Chinese.
let's see how the score comes out.
I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out.
two points, right there!
there's your goddamn score!
goddamn cats crawling up trees, 5 times 5 is 25...
fuck this place!
fuck it!
I feel bad.
I let him down.
that's crap, kid.
he's proud of you.
we're old friends, I know him as good as anybody.
smart fellow, ain't he?
smart as they come. He was a banker on the outside.
what's he in here for anyway?
murder.
the hell, you say.
you wouldn't think it to look at the guy.
caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased them both.
what?
about four years ago...
...I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.
I stole a car.
it was a dumb-fuck thing to do.
about six months left to go...
...I get a new cellmate in.
Elmo Blatch.
big, twitchy fucker.
kind of roomie you pray you don't get. You know what I'm saying?
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.
said he pulled hundreds of jobs.
hard to believe, high-strung as he was. You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.
talked all the time too. That's the other thing. He never shut up.
places he'd been in, jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.
even people he killed.
people who gave him shit.
that's how he put it.
so one night, like a joke...
...I say to him, "Elmo, who did you kill?"
so he says:
I got me this job one time, busing tables at a country club...
...so I could case all these big rich pricks that come in.
so I pick out this guy go in one night and do his place.
he wakes up and gives me shit.
so I killed him.
him and this tasty bitch he was with.
and that's the best part.
she's fucking this prick, see this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy.
some hotshot banker.
and he's the one they pinned it on.
I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.
what amazes me most is you'd be taken in by it.
sir?
it's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you.
he hears your tale of woe and naturally wants to cheer you up.
he's young, not terribly bright.
it's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.
sir, he's telling the truth.
let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist.
you think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, " Yes, I did it. I confess.
by the way, add a life term to my sentence.
with Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.
that's assuming Blatch is still there.
chances are, he'd be released by now.
they'd have his last known address. It's a chance, isn't it?
how can you be so obtuse?
what?
what did you call me?
obtuse. Is it deliberate?
you're forgetting yourself.
the country club will have his old timecards.
records, W-2s with his name on them.
if you want to indulge this fantasy, it's your business.
don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
if I got out, I'd never mention what happens here.
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering that money.
don't ever mention money to me, you son of a bitch!
not in this office...
...not anywhere. Get in here, now!
I just wanted to put you at ease, that's all.
solitary. A month.
what's wrong with you? Get him out of here.
this is my chance to get out! It's my life! Understand?!
get him out!
a month in the hole.
that's the longest stretch I ever heard of.
it's all my fault.
bullshit.
you didn't pull the trigger or convict him.
are you saying Andy is innocent?
I mean, for real innocent?
it looks that way.
sweet Jesus.
how long has he been here now?
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.
Williams, Thomas. - Yeah, over here.
what you got?
board of Education.
that son of a bitch mailed it.
you going to open it or stand there with your thumb up your butt?
thumb up my butt sounds better.
Skeets, come on. Give me that, you shithead.
Floyd, come on.
red
will you throw that away, please?
well, shit.
the kid passed. C + average.
thought you'd like to know.
warden wants to talk.
out here?
that's what the man said.
warden?
Tommy
I'm asking you to keep this conversation just between us.
I feel awkward enough as it is.
we got a situation here.
I think you can appreciate that.
Yes, sir.
I sure can.
I tell you, son, this thing really came along and knocked my wind out.
it's got me up nights. That's the truth.
the right thing to do sometimes it's hard to know what that is.
do you understand?
I need your help, son.
if I'm going to move on this there can't be the least little shred of doubt.
I have to know if what you told Dufresne was the truth.
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury...
...with your hand on the Good Book...
...and take an oath before Almighty God himself?
just give me that chance.
that's what I thought.
I'm sure by now you've heard.
terrible thing.
a man that young less than a year to go, trying to escape.
broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.
truly, it did.
we just have to put it behind us.
move on.
I'm done.
everything stops.
get someone else to run your scams.
nothing stops.
nothing.
or you will do the hardest time there is.
no more protection from the guards.
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton and cast you down with the sodomites.
you'll think you've been fucked by a train.
and the library?
gone.
sealed off, brick by brick.
we'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.
they'll see the flames for miles.
we'll dance around it like wild Injuns.
you understand me? Catching my drift?
or am I being obtuse?
give him another month to think about it.
my wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.
like a closed book.
complained about it all the time.
she was beautiful.
God, I loved her.
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.
I killed her, Red.
I didn't pull the trigger but I drove her away.
that's why she died, because of me the way I am.
that don't make you a murderer.
bad husband, maybe.
feel bad about it if you want, but you didn't pull the trigger.
no, I didn't.
somebody else did.
and I wound up in here.
bad luck, I guess.
it floats around.
it's got to land on somebody.
it was my turn, that's all.
I was in the path of the tornado.
I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.
think you'll ever get out of here?
me?
Yeah.
one day, when I got a long, white beard...
...and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs.
I tell you where I'd go.
Zihuatanejo.
say what?
Zihuatanejo.
it's in Mexico.
a little place on the Pacific Ocean.
you know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?
they say it has no memory.
that's where I want to live the rest of my life.
a warm place with no memory.
open up a little hotel right on the beach.
buy some worthless old boat and fix it up new.
take my guests out charter fishing.
Zihuatanejo.
in a place like that, I could use a man that knows how to get things.
I don't think I could make it on the outside.
I been in here most of my life.
I'm an institutional man now.
just like Brooks was.
you underestimate yourself.
I don't think so.
in here I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure, but...
...Outside all you need is the Yellow Pages.
hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.
pacific Ocean?
shit.
scare me to death, something that big.
not me.
I didn't shoot my wife, and I didn't shoot her lover.
whatever mistakes I made, I've paid for them and then some.
that hotel, that boat...
I don't think that's too much to ask.
you shouldn't be doing this to yourself.
this is just shitty pipe dreams.
mexico is way down there and you're in here and that's the way it is.
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.
it's down there and I'm in here.
I guess it comes down to a simple choice.
get busy living or get busy dying.
Andy
red
if you ever get out of here, do me a favor.
sure, Andy. Anything.
there's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?
a lot of hayfields up there. - One in particular.
it's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end.
it's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.
it's where I asked my wife to marry me.
we went there for a picnic...
...and made love under that oak...
...and I asked and she said yes.
promise me, Red.
if you ever get out and find that spot.
at the base of that wall, there's a rock that has no earthly business in Maine.
piece of black, volcanic glass.
something's buried under it I want you to have.
what, Andy?
what's buried under there?
you'll have to pry it up to see.
no, I'm telling you. The guy is...
he's talking funny.
I'm really worried about him.
let's keep an eye on him.
that's fine during the day, but at night he's all alone.
Oh, Lord.
what?
Andy come down to the loading dock today.
he asked me for a length of rope.
rope? Six feet long.
and you gave it to him.
sure. Why wouldn't I?
Jesus! Heywood. How was I supposed to know?
remember Brooks Hatlen?
Andy would never do that.
never.
I don't know.
every man has his breaking point.
Lickety-split. Want to get home.
just about finished, sir.
three deposits tonight.
get my stuff down to the laundry.
and shine my shoes.
I want them looking like mirrors. - Yes, sir.
it's good having you back.
place wasn't the same without you.
lights out!
I've had some long nights in stir.
alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts time can draw out like a blade.
that was the longest night of my life.
give me a count!
tier 3 south, clear!
tier 3 north, clear!
man missing on tier 2, cell 245!
Dufresne!
come out. You're holding up the show!
don't make me come down or I'll thump your skull for you!
damn it, you're putting me behind! I got a schedule to keep.
you'd better be sick or dead in there. I shit you not!
you hear me?
Oh, my Holy God.
I want every man on this cellblock questioned.
start with that friend of his. - Who?
he
open 237.
what do you mean, "He just wasn't here"? Don't say that to me.
don't tell me that again.
but sir, he wasn't.
I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?
is that what you're saying?
am I blind, Haig? - No, sir!
what about you. You blind?
tell me what this is. - Last night's count.
you see Dufresne's name there? I sure do. Right there.
Dufresne.
he was in his cell at lights out.
reasonable he'd be here in the morning.
I want him found.
not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!
Yes, sir.
let's go. Move your butts.
stand.
well?
well, what?
I see you two all the time. You're thick as thieves, you are.
he must have said something.
no, sir, Warden.
not a word.
Lord, it's a miracle!
man vanished like a fart in the wind.
nothing left but some damn rocks on a windowsill.
and that cupcake on the wall. Let's ask her.
maybe she knows.
what say there, fuzzy-britches? Feel like talking?
guess not.
why should she be any different?
this is a conspiracy.
that's what this is.
one big, damn conspiracy!
and everyone's in on it!
including her!
in 1966 Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank Prison
all they found was a muddy set of prison clothes a bar of soap...and an old rock hammer... damn near worn down to the nub.
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.
old Andy did it in less than 20.
Oh, Andy loved geology.
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.
an ice age here...million years of mountain building there.
geology is the study of pressure and time.
that's all it takes, really.
pressure and time.
that and a big goddamn poster.
like I said in prison, a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.
seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard a handful at a time.
I guess after Tommy was killed...
Andy decided he'd been here long enough.
Lickety-split. I want to get home.
I'm just about finished, sir.
three deposits tonight.
Andy did like he was told.
buffed those shoes to a high mirror-shine.
the guards simply didn't notice.
neither did I.
I mean, seriously how often do you really look at a man's shoes?
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.
or maybe I just don't want to.
five hundred yards.
that's the length of five football fields.
just shy of half a mile.
the next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her secret a man nobody ever laid eyes on before...strolled into the Maine National Bank..
until that moment, he didn't exist.
except on paper. - May I help you?
he had all the proper ID...
driver's license, birth certificate, Social Security card...
and the signature was a spot-on match.
I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business.
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.
thank you.
I'm sure I will.
here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else?
please.
would you add this to your outgoing mail?
I'd be happy to.
good day, sir.
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.
all told, he blew town with better than $370, 000 of Warden Norton's money.
severance pay for 19 years.
good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.
Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.
if you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.
I wasn't there to see, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl when they took him away.
norton had no intention of going that quietly.
samuel Norton.
we have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.
open the door.
I'm not sure which key.
make it easy on yourself, Norton!
I like to think the last thing that went through his head other than that bullet was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.
not long after the warden deprived us of his company I got a postcard in the mail.
it was blank, but the postmark said Fort Hancock, Texas.
fort Hancoc right on the border.
that's where Andy crossed.
when I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down, it always makes me laugh.
Andy Dufresne
who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side.
Andy Dufresne headed for the Pacific.
Hadley's got him by the throat, right?
he says, " I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident."
those of us who knew him best talk about him often.
I swear, the stuff he pulled...
my friends could use a couple of beers.
and he got it!
sometimes it makes me sad, though Andy being gone.
I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.
their feathers are just too bright.
and when they fly away the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.
but still the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.
I guess I just miss my friend.
please sit down.
Ellis Boyd Redding your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.
you feel you've been rehabilitated?
rehabilitated?
well, now, let me see.
I don't have any idea what that means.
it means you're ready to rejoin society...
I know what you think it means, Sonny.
to me it's just a made-up word.
a politician's word so that young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie and have a job.
what do you really want to know?
am I sorry for what I did?
well, are you?
there's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.
not because I'm in here or because you think I should.
I look back on the way I was then a young stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.
I want to talk to him.
I want to try and talk some sense to him.
tell him the way things are.
but I can't.
that kid's long gone and this old man is all that's left.
I got to live with that.
rehabilitated?
it's just a bullshit word.
so you go on and stamp your forms, sonny, and stop wasting my time.
because to tell you the truth...
...I don't give a shit.
here you go, miss.
restroom break?
you don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go.
yes
forty years I've been asking permission to piss.
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.
there's a harsh truth to face.
no way I'm going to make it on the outside.
all I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole so maybe they'd send me back.
terrible thing, to live in fear.
Brooks Hatlen knew it.
knew it all too well.
all I want is to be back where things make sense.
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.
only one thing stops me.
a promise I made to Andy.
there it is.
much obliged, sir.
dear Red:
if you're reading this, you've gotten out and if you've come this far, maybe you'd come a bit further
you remember the name of the town, don't you?
Zihuatanejo.
I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels.
I'll keep an eye out for you, and the chessboard ready.
remember, Red...
... Hope is a good thing...
... Maybe the best of things.
and no good thing ever dies.
I will be hoping that this letter finds you and finds you well.
your friend...
... Andy.
get busy living or get busy dying.
that's goddamn right.
for the second time in my life I'm guilty of committing a crime.
parole violation.
of course I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that.
not for an old crook like me.
fort Hancock, Texas, please.
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.
I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel.
a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain.
I hope I can make it across the border.
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.
I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.
I hope.
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.
I guess he had a lot on his mind trying to adapt to life on the inside.
wasn't until a month went by before he opened his mouth to say more than two words to somebody.
as it turned out that somebody was me.
I'm Andy Dufresne.
Wife-killing banker.
why'd you do it?
I didn't, since you ask.
you're going to fit right in.
everybody in here's innocent. Didn't you know that?
what you in here for? - Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.
rumor has it you're a real cold fish.
you think your shit smells sweeter than most. Is that right?
what do you think?
to tell you the truth, I haven't made up my mind.
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time.
I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
what?
a rock hammer.
what is it and why? - What do you care?
for a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask. I'd quote a price.
but a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't it?
fair enough.
a rock hammer is about six or seven inches long.
looks like a miniature pickax. - Pickax?
for rocks.
quartz?
quartz
and some mica, shale，limestone.
so?
so I'm a rock hound.
at least I was in my old life. I'd like to be again.
or maybe you'd like to sink your toy into somebody's skull.
no, I have no enemies here.
no? Wait a while.
word gets around.
the Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.
especially Bogs.
don't suppose it would help if I told them I'm not homosexual.
neither are they.
you have to be human first. They don't qualify.
bull queers take by force. That's all they want or understand.
if I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.
thanks for the advice. - Well, that's free.
you understand my concern.
if there's trouble, I won't use the rock hammer.
then I'd guess you want to escape. Tunnel under the wall, maybe.
what did I miss? What's so funny?
you'll understand when you see the rock hammer.
what's an item like this usually go for?
seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.
my normal markup's 20 percent.
but this is a specialty item.
risk goes up, price goes up. Let's make it an even 10 bucks.
ten it is.
waste of money, if you ask me.
Why's that?
folks around this joint love surprise inspections.
they find it, you're going to lose it.
if they catch you, you don't know me.
mention my name, we never do business again.
not for shoelaces or a stick of gum. Now you got that?
I understand.
thank you, Mr...
red.
name's Red.
red
why do they call you that?
maybe it's because I'm Irish.
I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.
he had a quiet way about him a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.
he strolled like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world.
like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.
yes
I think it'd be fair to say...
... I liked Andy from the start.
let's go! Some of us got a schedule to keep.
move it! Come on, move it!
how you doing? How's the wife treating you?
continues
continues
red
Andy was right.
I finally got the joke.
it would take a man about 600 years to tunnel under the wall with one of these.
book? - Not today.
book?
Brooks
delivery for Dufresne.
wants the book?
wants the book?
here's your book.
Thanks.
we're running low on hexite. Get on back and fetch us up some.
this will blind you.
honey, hush.
that's it. You fight!
better that way.
I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight and the Sisters let him be.
I wish I could tell you that but prison is no fairy-tale world.
he never said who did it.
but we all knew.
things went on like that for a while.
prison life consists of routine and then more routine.
every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.
the Sisters kept at him.
sometimes he was able to fight them off.
sometimes not.
and that's how it went for Andy.
that was his routine.
I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.
and I also believe that if things had gone on that way this place would have got the best of him.
but then, in the spring of 1949 the powers that be decided:
the roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing.
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.
as you know special detail carries with it special privileges.
it was outdoor detail and May is one damned fine month to be working outdoors.
stay in line there.
more than a hundred men volunteered for the job.
Wallace E. Unger.
Ellis Redding.
wouldn't you know it?
me and some fellows I know were among the names called.
andrew Dufresne.
it only cost us a pack of smokes per man.
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.
so this big-shot lawyer calls me long-distance from Texas.
I say, "Yeah?
he says, "Sorry to inform you, but your brother just died.
I'm sorry to hear that. - I'm not. He was an asshole.
ran off years ago. Figured him for dead.
so this lawyer fellow says to me:
"he died a rich man. Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks."
a million bucks?
incredible how lucky some assholes get. - You going to see any of that?
thirty-five thousand. That's what he left me.
dollars?
that's great! That's like winning the sweepstakes.
isn't it?
dumb shit, what do you think the government will do to me?
take a big wet bite out of my ass is what.
poor Byron.
terrible fucking luck, huh? Crying shame.
some people really got it awful.
Andy, are you nuts?
keep your eyes on your mop, man!
you'll pay some tax, but you'll still end up...
Yeah, maybe enough to buy a new car, and then what?
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair maintenance, kids pestering you to take them for a ride all the time.
then if you figure your tax wrong, you pay out of your own pocket.
I tell you! Uncle Sam!
he puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple.
Andy, Andy - Getting himself killed. - Keep tarring.
some brother. Shit!
Mr. Hadley，do you trust your wife?
Oh, that's funny.
you'll look funnier sucking my dick with no teeth.
what I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back?
step aside, Mert. This fucker's having himself an accident.
he'll push him off!
if you trust her, you can keep that 35000.
what did you say? - Thirty-five thousand.
all of it.
every penny. - You better start making sense.
if you want to keep it, give it to your wife.
the IRS allows a one-time-only gift to your spouse for up to $ 60000.
bullshit. Tax-free? - Tax-free.
IRS can't touch one cent.
you're that smart banker that killed his wife.
why should I believe you? So I can end up in here with you?
it's legal. Ask the IRS. They'll say the same thing.
I feel stupid telling you this. I'm sure you would have investigated.
I don't need you to tell me where the bear shit in the buckwheat.
of course not. But you do need someone to set it up for you.
that'll cost you. A lawyer.
a bunch of ball-washing bastards!
I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money.
you get the forms, I'll prepare them nearly free of charge.
I'd only ask three beers apiece for each of my coworkers.
coworkers. That's rich!
a man working outdoors feels more like a man if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion，sir.
what are you jimmies staring at?
let's go! Work!
and that's how it came to pass that on the second-to-last day of the job
... the convict crew that tarred the factory roof in the spring of '49 wound up sitting in a row at 10: 00 in the morning...
...Drinking icy-cold beer, courtesy of the hardest screw...
... That ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.
drink up while it's cold, ladies.
the colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.
we sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.
we could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses.
we were the lords of all creation.
as for Andy...
... He spent that break hunkered in the shade...
... A strange little smile on his face...
... Watching us drink his beer.
want a cold one?
no, thanks. I gave up drinking.
you could argue he done it to curry favor with the guards.
or maybe make a few friends among us cons.
me?
I think he did it just to feel normal again...
... If only for a short while.
king me.
chess. Now there's a game of kings. - What?
civilized. Strategic.
and a total fucking mystery. I hate it.
let me teach you someday.
sure.
we could get a board together.
you're talking to the right man. I can get things, right?
we might do business on a board, and I'll carve the pieces myself.
one side in alabaster, one in soapstone. What do you think?
I think it'll take years.
years I got. What I don't have are the rocks.
pickings are pretty slim in the yard.
pebbles, mostly.
we're getting to be kind of friends, aren't we?
Yeah, I guess.
can I ask you something?
why'd you do it?
I'm innocent, Red.
just like everybody else here.
what are you in for?
murder. Same as you.
innocent?
only guilty man in Shawshank.
Where's the canary?
how did you know?
how did I know what? - So you don't know.
come.
this is where the canary is.
quite a surprise to hear a woman singing in my house, eh?
that's quite a surprise.
red
wait, wait.
here she comes.
I like this part when she does that shit with her hair.
I know. I've seen it three times this month.
Gilda, are you decent?
me?
God, I love it.
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. What do you want?
Rita Hayworth. - What?
can you get her?
so this is Johnny Farrel. I've heard a lot about you.
take a few weeks. - Weeks?
I don't have her stuffed down the front of my pants right now, sorry to say.
but I'll get her.
relax.
Thanks.
indeed, you should introduce to visit him
you said what I do make?
no, I must let him be pleasantly surprised
calming down, Farrel - Get out! - I got to change reels!
I said fuck off!
ain't you going to scream?
let's get this over with.
he broke my fucking nose!
now...
...I'm going to open my fly...
...and you'll swallow what I give you to swallow.
then you'll swallow Rooster's. You broke his nose.
he ought to have something to show for it.
you put it in my mouth, you lose it.
no, you don't understand.
do that and I'll put all eight inches of this in your ear.
all right, but you should know that sudden, serious brain injury...
...Causes the victim to bite down hard.
in fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong...
...they have to pry the victim's jaws open...
...with a crowbar.
where do you get this shit?
I read it.
you know how to read, you ignorant fuck?
honey!
you shouldn't!
bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth.
and neither did his friends.
what they did do is beat him within an inch of his life.
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.
bogs spent a week in the hole.
time's up, Bogs.
it's your world, boss.
return to your cellblocks for evening count.
all prisoners report for lock down.
what?
Where's he going? - Grab his ankles.
no... Help!
two things never happened again after that.
the Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again.
and Bogs would never walk again.
they transferred him to a minimum-security hospital upstate.
to my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days...
... Drinking his food through a straw.
Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary.
sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.
the man likes to play chess.
let's get him some rocks.
guys!
I got one.
I got one. Look!
heywood, that isn't soapstone! And it ain't alabaster either.
what are you, a fucking geologist?
he's right. It ain't.
what the hell is it then? - It's a horse apple.
bullshit! - No, horseshit.
petrified.
God
Damn!
despite a few hitches, the boys came through in fine style.
and by the weekend he was due back...
... We had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till rapture.
also got a big shipment in that week.
cigarettes...
... Chewing gum...
... Sipping whisky...
... Playing cards with naked ladies on them. You name it.
and of course, the most important item:
Rita Hayworth herself.
everybody awakes
heads up. They're tossing cells.
heads up. They're tossing cells!
119
123
on your feet.
face the wall.
turn around and face the warden.
pleased to see you reading this.
any favorite passages?
watch ye, therefore, for ye know not...
...when the master of the house cometh.
mark 13: 35.
I've always liked that one.
but I prefer...
..." I am the light of the world."
ye that followeth me shall have the light of life.
John, chapter 8, verse 12.
I hear you're good with numbers.
how nice.
man should have a skill.
explain this.
it's called a rock blanket. It's for shaping and polishing rocks.
a little hobby of mine.
it's pretty clean.
some contraband here, but nothing to get in a twist over.
I can't say I approve of this.
but I suppose...
...Exceptions can be made.
lock them up!
I almost forgot.
I'd hate to deprive you of this.
salvation lies within.
Yes, sir.
tossing cells was just an excuse.
truth is Norton wanted to size Andy up.
my wife made that in church group.
very nice, sir.
you enjoy working the laundry?
no, sir. Not especially.
perhaps we can find something more befitting a man of your education.
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?
I thought I heard you out here.
I've been reassigned to you.
I know, they told me.
ain't that a kick in the head?
well, I'll give you the dime tour.
come on.
well, here she is.
the Shawshank Prison Library.
national Geographics...
...Reader's Digest condensed books...
...and Louis L'Amour.
look magazine.
Erle Stanley Gardners.
every evening I load up the cart and make my rounds.
I enter the names on this clipboard here.
easy, peasy, Japanese-y.
any questions? - How long have you been librarian?
I come here in '05, and they made me librarian in 1912.
and have you ever had an assistant?
no. Not much to it, really.
why me? Why now?
I don't know.
but it'd be nice to have some company down here.
Dufresne
that's him. That's the one.
I'm Dekins.
I was thinking about setting up some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.
I see.
why don't we have a seat and talk it over.
do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?
Thanks.
so...
mister Dekins...
and then Andy says, 、 Mr. Dekins...
...do you want your sons to go to Harvard or Yale?
he didn't say that!
as God as my witness!
Dekins blinked for a second...
...then he laughed and actually shook Andy's hand.
my ass! - Shook his hand.
I tell you, I near soiled myself!
all he needed was a suit and tie and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...
...He'd have been "Mr. Dufresne," if you please.
making a few friends?
I wouldn't say "friends.
I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.
it's a wonderful pet to have.
got you out of the laundry, though.
it might do more than that.
how about expanding the library. Get some new books.
if you ask for something, ask for a pool table.
right
how do you expect to do that? I mean...
...get new books in here, Mr. Dufresne, if you please.
I'll ask the warden for funds.
six wardens have been through here in my tenure, and I've learned...
...one immutable, universal truth:
not one born whose asshole...
...Wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you ask for funds.
the budget's stretched thin as it is. - I see.
maybe I could write the state senate and request funds from them.
they have only three ways to spend the taxpayers' money for prisons:
more walls, more bars, more guards.
I'd like to try, with permission. A letter a week.
they can't ignore me forever. - Sure can.
but you write your letters if it makes you happy.
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?
so Andy started writing a letter a week just like he said.
and like Norton said Andy got no answers.
the following April, he did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.
year after that, he did them all including the warden's.
year after that, they rescheduled the intramural season to coincide with tax season.
the guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2s.
so Moresby Prison issued you a gun but you paid for it.
right. The holster too.
that's tax-deductible. You can write that off.
Yes, sir! Andy was a regular cottage industry.
in fact, it got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.
could you hand me a stack of 1040s?
got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.
and still, he kept sending those letters.
red, Andy, It's Brooks.
watch the door.
please, Brooks.
calm the fuck down. - Stay back!
stay back, goddamn it! - What's going on?
one second he's fine, then out come the knives.
we can talk about this, right?
there's nothing to talk about. I'll cut his fucking throat.
what's he done to you?
it's what they done!
I got no choice.
you won't hurt Heywood. We all know that.
right, Heywood? - Sure.
he's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.
right, guys?
so put the knife down. Look at me.
put the knife down.
look at his neck, for God's sake.
look at his neck. He's bleeding.
it's the only way they'd let me stay.
this is crazy. You don't want to do this.
put it, put it down.
take it easy.
you'll be all right.
him? What about me?
crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!
you've had worse from shaving.
what did you do to set him off?
nothing. I come in here to say farewell.
ain't you heard? His parole's come through.
I just don't understand what happened in there.
old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.
that's enough out of you.
heard he had you shitting your pants. - Fuck you.
IKnock it off.
Brooks ain't no bug.
he is only...
he's just institutionalized.
institutionalized, my ass.
the man's been in here 50 years, Heywood, 50 years!
this is all he knows.
in here, he's an important man...
...an educated man.
outside, he's nothing.
just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.
probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.
you know what I'm trying to say?
I do believe you're talking out of your ass.
you believe whatever you want.
but I tell you these walls are funny.
first you hate them.
then you get used to them.
enough time passes...
...you get so you depend on them.
that's "institutionalized.
shit.
I could never get like that. - Oh, yeah?
wait till you've been here as long as Brooks.
goddamn right.
they send you here for life...
...that's exactly what they take.
part that counts, anyway.
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.
you go on now.
you're free.
you're free.
good luck, Brooksie.
taking care
dear fellas:
I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.
watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?
I saw an automobile once when I was a kid...
...but now they're everywhere.
the world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.
the parole board got me into this halfway house...
... called "The Brewer..."
... and a job...
... Bagging groceries at the Food-Way.
it's hard work and I try to keep up...
... But my hands hurt most of the time.
make sure your man double-bags.
last time, the bottom near came out.
make sure you double-bag like the lady says. Understand?
Yes, sir. Surely will.
I don't think the store manager likes me very much.
sometimes after work, I go to the park and feed the birds.
I keep thinking...
... Jake might just show up and say hello.
but he never does.
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.
I have trouble sleeping at night.
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.
I wake up scared.
sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.
maybe I should get a gun and rob the Food-Way so they'd send me home.
I could shoot the manager while I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.
I don't like it here.
I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided...
...not to stay.
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...
... Not for an old crook like me.
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss, not for an old crook like me.
P. S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.
no hard feelings. Brooks.
he should have died in here.
what the fuck have you done?
it's a goddamn mess, I'll tell you that.
what's all this? - You tell me. They're addressed to you.
take it.
dear Mr. Dufresne:
in response to your inquiries...
...the state has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project.
this is $ 200.
in addition, the library district has generously responded...
...with a donation of used books and sundries.
we trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed.
please stop sending us letters.
clear all this out before the warden gets back.
Yes, sir.
good for you, Andy.
Wow!
it only took six years.
from now on, I'll write two letters a week instead of one.
I believe you're crazy enough. Get this stuff out...
...like he said. I've got to pinch a loaf.
when I come back...
...this is all gone, all right?
do you hear that?
Dufresne!
Andy, let me out!
Andy
I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.
truth is, I don't want to know.
some things are best left unsaid.
I like to think it was something so beautiful...
... It can't be expressed in words...
... And makes your heart ache because of it.
I tell you, those voices soared...
... Higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.
it was like a beautiful bird flapped into our drab cage and made those walls dissolve away.
and for the briefest of moments every last man at Shawshank felt free.
it pissed the warden off something awful.
open the door.
open it up!
Dufresne, open this door!
turn that off!
I am warning you. Turn that off!
Dufresne
you're mine now.
Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.
on your feet.
Hey, look who's here. - Maestro!
you couldn't play something good, huh? Like Hank Williams?
they broke the door down before I could take requests.
was it worth two weeks? - Easiest time I ever did.
no such thing as easy time in the hole. - A week in the hole is like a year.
damn straight. - I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.
so they let you tote that record player down there, huh?
it was in here.
in here.
that's the beauty of music. They can't get that from you.
haven't you ever felt that way about music?
well, I played a mean harmonica as a younger man.
lost interest in it, though.
didn't make much sense in here.
here's where it makes the most sense.
you need it so you don't forget.
forget?
forget that there are...
...Places...
...in the world that aren't made out of stone.
there's something...
...Inside...
...that they can't get to...
...that they can't touch.
that's yours.
what are you talking about?
hope.
hope.
let me tell you something, my friend.
hope is a dangerous thing.
hope can drive a man insane.
it's got no use on the inside.
you'd better get used to that idea.
like Brooks did?
sit down.
says here that you've served 30 years of a life sentence.
you feel you've been rehabilitated?
Oh, yes, sir.
without a doubt.
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.
no danger to society here.
God's honest truth.
absolutely rehabilitated.
thirty years.
Jesus, when you say it like that...
you wonder where it went.
I wonder where 10 years went.
here.
a little parole rejection present.
go ahead and open it.
went through one of your competitors.
I hope you don't mind. I wanted it to be a surprise.
it's very pretty.
thank you.
you going to play it?
no.
not right now.
roll in!
lights out!
Andy was as good as his word.
he wrote two letters a week instead of one.
in 1959, the state senate finally clued in to the fact they couldn't buy him off with just a $ 200 check.
appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of $500 just to shut him up.
and you'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it.
he made deals with book clubs, charity groups.
he bought remaindered books by the pound...
treasure Island.
robert Louis...
Stevenson.
fiction, adventure.
what's next?
I got here Auto Repair and Soap Carving.
trade skills and hobbies. Under "Educational," behind you.
count of Monte Crisco.
that's "Cristo," you dumb shit.
by Alexandree Dum-ass.
dumb ass.
dumb ass?
Dumas. IKnow what that's about?
you'd like it. It's about a prison break.
we ought to file that under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?
the rest of us did our best to pitch in when and where we could.
by the year Kennedy was shot...
... Andy had transformed a storage room smelling of turpentine into the best prison library in New England complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.
that was also when Warden Norton instituted his famous "Inside Out" program.
you may remember reading about it.
it made the papers and got his picture in Look magazine.
it's no free ride but rather a genuine progressive advance in corrections and rehabilitation.
our inmates, properly supervised will be put to work outside these walls performing all manner of public service.
these men can learn the value of an honest day's labor and provide a service to the community...
...At a bare minimum of expense to Mr. And Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.
of course he didn't tell the press that "bare minimum of expense" is a fairly loose term.
there are 100 different ways to skim off the top.
men, materials, you name it.
and oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in!
at this rate, you'll put me out of business.
with this pool of slave labor, you can underbid any contractor in town.
we're providing a valuable community service.
that's fine for the papers, but I've got a family to feed.
we go back a long way.
I need this highway contract. I don't get it and I go under. That's a fact.
you have some of this fine pie my missus made for you. You think about that.
I wouldn't worry too much about this contract.
I already got my boys committed elsewhere.
you be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.
and behind every shady deal...
... Behind every dollar earned...
... There was Andy, keeping the books.
two deposits.
Maine National and New England First. Night drops as always, sir.
get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
if they over-starch my shirts again, they'll hear from me.
how do I look?
very nice. - Big charity to-do up Portland way. - Governor will be there.
you want the rest of this?
woman can't bake worth shit.
thank you, sir.
he's got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.
he's got scams you haven't even dreamed of. IKickbacks on his kickbacks.
a river of dirty money running through here.
sooner or later, he'll have to explain where it came from.
that's where I come in.
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.
stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.
I send it out into the real world, and when it comes back...
clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh? - Cleaner.
by the time Norton retires, I'll have made him a millionaire.
if they ever catch on, he'll wind up in here wearing a number himself.
I thought you had more faith in me than that.
I know you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail.
now anybody gets curious, FBI, IRS...
...Whatever.
it'll lead to somebody.
sure it is, but not to me, and certainly not to the warden.
all right, who?
Randall Stevens.
who?
the "silent" silent partner.
he's the guilty one, the man with the bank accounts.
it's where the filtering process starts.
they trace anything, it'll just lead to him.
but who is he?
he's a phantom, an apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.
I conjured him out of thin air.
he doesn't exist, except on paper.
you can't just make a person up.
sure you can, if you know how the system works.
it's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate, driver's license, social security.
you're shitting me.
if they trace any accounts, they'll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination.
well, I'll be damned!
did I say you were good?
shit, you are Rembrandt.
the funny thing is on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow.
I had to come to prison to be a crook.
ever bother you?
I don't run the scams. I just process the profits.
a fine line, maybe...
...but I also built that library and used it to help guys get their high school diploma.
why do you think he lets me do all that?
keep you happy and doing the laundry.
money instead of sheets.
well, I work cheap. That's the tradeoff.
Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965...
... On a two-year stretch for B and E.
that's breaking and entering to you.
cops caught him sneaking TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney.
young punk.
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...
... Cocky as hell.
come on, old boys. Moving like molasses!
making me look bad.
we liked him immediately.
I'm backing out the door and I got the TV like this.
a big old thing. I couldn't see shit. Then I hear this voice.
freeze, kid, hands in the air.
I was standing there, holding onto that TV. Finally the voice says:
you hear what I said, boy? I say, Yes, sir. I did.
but if I drop this, you get me on destruction of property too.
you done some stretch in Cashman, right?
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time, let me tell you.
weekend furloughs. Work programs.
not like here.
sounds like you done time all over.
I've been in and out since I was 13.
name it, chances are I've been there.
perhaps you should try a new profession.
what I mean is you're not a very good thief. You should try something else.
Yeah, what the hell you know about it, Capone?
what are you in for?
me?
a lawyer fucked me.
everybody's innocent in here. Don't you know that?
as it turned out, Tommy had himself a young wife and a new baby girl.
maybe he thought of them on the streets or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.
whatever it was something lit a fire under that boy's ass.
thought I might try for my high school equivalency.
hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.
I ain't no goddamn loser.
you mean that? - Yeah.
you really mean that?
Yes, sir, I do.
good. Because if we do this...
...we do it all the way, a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.
thing is, see I don't read so good.
well.
you don't read so well.
we'll get to that.
so Andy took Tommy under his wing.
started walking him through his ABC's.
Tommy took to it pretty well too.
boy found brains he never knew he had.
before long, Andy started him on his course requirements.
he really liked the kid.
gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shit heap.
but that wasn't the only reason.
prison time is slow time.
so you do what you can to keep going.
some fellas collect stamps.
others build matchstick houses.
Andy built a library.
now he needed a new project.
Tommy was it.
it was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks.
the same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.
in prison...
... A man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.
by 1966, right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams...
... It was lovely Raquel.
time.
well?
well, it's for shit.
I wasted a whole year of my time with this bullshit.
it's probably not that bad.
I didn't get a thing right. It might as well have been in Chinese.
let's see how the score comes out.
I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out.
two points, right there!
there's your goddamn score!
goddamn cats crawling up trees, 5 times 5 is 25...
fuck this place!
fuck it!
I feel bad.
I let him down.
that's crap, kid.
he's proud of you.
we're old friends, I know him as good as anybody.
smart fellow, ain't he?
smart as they come. He was a banker on the outside.
what's he in here for anyway?
murder.
the hell, you say.
you wouldn't think it to look at the guy.
caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased them both.
what?
about four years ago...
...I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.
I stole a car.
it was a dumb-fuck thing to do.
about six months left to go...
...I get a new cellmate in.
Elmo Blatch.
big, twitchy fucker.
kind of roomie you pray you don't get. You know what I'm saying?
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.
said he pulled hundreds of jobs.
hard to believe, high-strung as he was. You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.
talked all the time too. That's the other thing. He never shut up.
places he'd been in, jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.
even people he killed.
people who gave him shit.
that's how he put it.
so one night, like a joke...
...I say to him, "Elmo, who did you kill?"
so he says:
I got me this job one time, busing tables at a country club...
...so I could case all these big rich pricks that come in.
so I pick out this guy go in one night and do his place.
he wakes up and gives me shit.
so I killed him.
him and this tasty bitch he was with.
and that's the best part.
she's fucking this prick, see this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy.
some hotshot banker.
and he's the one they pinned it on.
I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.
what amazes me most is you'd be taken in by it.
sir?
it's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you.
he hears your tale of woe and naturally wants to cheer you up.
he's young, not terribly bright.
it's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.
sir, he's telling the truth.
let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist.
you think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, " Yes, I did it. I confess.
by the way, add a life term to my sentence.
with Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.
that's assuming Blatch is still there.
chances are, he'd be released by now.
they'd have his last known address. It's a chance, isn't it?
how can you be so obtuse?
what?
what did you call me?
obtuse. Is it deliberate?
you're forgetting yourself.
the country club will have his old timecards.
records, W-2s with his name on them.
if you want to indulge this fantasy, it's your business.
don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
if I got out, I'd never mention what happens here.
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering that money.
don't ever mention money to me, you son of a bitch!
not in this office...
...not anywhere. Get in here, now!
I just wanted to put you at ease, that's all.
solitary. A month.
what's wrong with you? Get him out of here.
this is my chance to get out! It's my life! Understand?!
get him out!
a month in the hole.
that's the longest stretch I ever heard of.
it's all my fault.
bullshit.
you didn't pull the trigger or convict him.
are you saying Andy is innocent?
I mean, for real innocent?
it looks that way.
sweet Jesus.
how long has he been here now?
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.
Williams, Thomas. - Yeah, over here.
what you got?
board of Education.
that son of a bitch mailed it.
you going to open it or stand there with your thumb up your butt?
thumb up my butt sounds better.
Skeets, come on. Give me that, you shithead.
Floyd, come on.
red
will you throw that away, please?
well, shit.
the kid passed. C + average.
thought you'd like to know.
warden wants to talk.
out here?
that's what the man said.
warden?
Tommy
I'm asking you to keep this conversation just between us.
I feel awkward enough as it is.
we got a situation here.
I think you can appreciate that.
Yes, sir.
I sure can.
I tell you, son, this thing really came along and knocked my wind out.
it's got me up nights. That's the truth.
the right thing to do sometimes it's hard to know what that is.
do you understand?
I need your help, son.
if I'm going to move on this there can't be the least little shred of doubt.
I have to know if what you told Dufresne was the truth.
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury...
...with your hand on the Good Book...
...and take an oath before Almighty God himself?
just give me that chance.
that's what I thought.
I'm sure by now you've heard.
terrible thing.
a man that young less than a year to go, trying to escape.
broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.
truly, it did.
we just have to put it behind us.
move on.
I'm done.
everything stops.
get someone else to run your scams.
nothing stops.
nothing.
or you will do the hardest time there is.
no more protection from the guards.
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton and cast you down with the sodomites.
you'll think you've been fucked by a train.
and the library?
gone.
sealed off, brick by brick.
we'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.
they'll see the flames for miles.
we'll dance around it like wild Injuns.
you understand me? Catching my drift?
or am I being obtuse?
give him another month to think about it.
my wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.
like a closed book.
complained about it all the time.
she was beautiful.
God, I loved her.
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.
I killed her, Red.
I didn't pull the trigger but I drove her away.
that's why she died, because of me the way I am.
that don't make you a murderer.
bad husband, maybe.
feel bad about it if you want, but you didn't pull the trigger.
no, I didn't.
somebody else did.
and I wound up in here.
bad luck, I guess.
it floats around.
it's got to land on somebody.
it was my turn, that's all.
I was in the path of the tornado.
I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.
think you'll ever get out of here?
me?
Yeah.
one day, when I got a long, white beard...
...and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs.
I tell you where I'd go.
Zihuatanejo.
say what?
Zihuatanejo.
it's in Mexico.
a little place on the Pacific Ocean.
you know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?
they say it has no memory.
that's where I want to live the rest of my life.
a warm place with no memory.
open up a little hotel right on the beach.
buy some worthless old boat and fix it up new.
take my guests out charter fishing.
Zihuatanejo.
in a place like that, I could use a man that knows how to get things.
I don't think I could make it on the outside.
I been in here most of my life.
I'm an institutional man now.
just like Brooks was.
you underestimate yourself.
I don't think so.
in here I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure, but...
...Outside all you need is the Yellow Pages.
hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.
pacific Ocean?
shit.
scare me to death, something that big.
not me.
I didn't shoot my wife, and I didn't shoot her lover.
whatever mistakes I made, I've paid for them and then some.
that hotel, that boat...
I don't think that's too much to ask.
you shouldn't be doing this to yourself.
this is just shitty pipe dreams.
mexico is way down there and you're in here and that's the way it is.
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.
it's down there and I'm in here.
I guess it comes down to a simple choice.
get busy living or get busy dying.
Andy
red
if you ever get out of here, do me a favor.
sure, Andy. Anything.
there's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?
a lot of hayfields up there. - One in particular.
it's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end.
it's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.
it's where I asked my wife to marry me.
we went there for a picnic...
...and made love under that oak...
...and I asked and she said yes.
promise me, Red.
if you ever get out and find that spot.
at the base of that wall, there's a rock that has no earthly business in Maine.
piece of black, volcanic glass.
something's buried under it I want you to have.
what, Andy?
what's buried under there?
you'll have to pry it up to see.
no, I'm telling you. The guy is...
he's talking funny.
I'm really worried about him.
let's keep an eye on him.
that's fine during the day, but at night he's all alone.
Oh, Lord.
what?
Andy come down to the loading dock today.
he asked me for a length of rope.
rope? Six feet long.
and you gave it to him.
sure. Why wouldn't I?
Jesus! Heywood. How was I supposed to know?
remember Brooks Hatlen?
Andy would never do that.
never.
I don't know.
every man has his breaking point.
Lickety-split. Want to get home.
just about finished, sir.
three deposits tonight.
get my stuff down to the laundry.
and shine my shoes.
I want them looking like mirrors. - Yes, sir.
it's good having you back.
place wasn't the same without you.
lights out!
I've had some long nights in stir.
alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts time can draw out like a blade.
that was the longest night of my life.
give me a count!
tier 3 south, clear!
tier 3 north, clear!
man missing on tier 2, cell 245!
Dufresne!
come out. You're holding up the show!
don't make me come down or I'll thump your skull for you!
damn it, you're putting me behind! I got a schedule to keep.
you'd better be sick or dead in there. I shit you not!
you hear me?
Oh, my Holy God.
I want every man on this cellblock questioned.
start with that friend of his. - Who?
he
open 237.
what do you mean, "He just wasn't here"? Don't say that to me.
don't tell me that again.
but sir, he wasn't.
I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?
is that what you're saying?
am I blind, Haig? - No, sir!
what about you. You blind?
tell me what this is. - Last night's count.
you see Dufresne's name there? I sure do. Right there.
Dufresne.
he was in his cell at lights out.
reasonable he'd be here in the morning.
I want him found.
not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!
Yes, sir.
let's go. Move your butts.
stand.
well?
well, what?
I see you two all the time. You're thick as thieves, you are.
he must have said something.
no, sir, Warden.
not a word.
Lord, it's a miracle!
man vanished like a fart in the wind.
nothing left but some damn rocks on a windowsill.
and that cupcake on the wall. Let's ask her.
maybe she knows.
what say there, fuzzy-britches? Feel like talking?
guess not.
why should she be any different?
this is a conspiracy.
that's what this is.
one big, damn conspiracy!
and everyone's in on it!
including her!
in 1966 Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank Prison
all they found was a muddy set of prison clothes a bar of soap...and an old rock hammer... damn near worn down to the nub.
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.
old Andy did it in less than 20.
Oh, Andy loved geology.
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.
an ice age here...million years of mountain building there.
geology is the study of pressure and time.
that's all it takes, really.
pressure and time.
that and a big goddamn poster.
like I said in prison, a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.
seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard a handful at a time.
I guess after Tommy was killed...
Andy decided he'd been here long enough.
Lickety-split. I want to get home.
I'm just about finished, sir.
three deposits tonight.
Andy did like he was told.
buffed those shoes to a high mirror-shine.
the guards simply didn't notice.
neither did I.
I mean, seriously how often do you really look at a man's shoes?
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.
or maybe I just don't want to.
five hundred yards.
that's the length of five football fields.
just shy of half a mile.
the next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her secret a man nobody ever laid eyes on before...strolled into the Maine National Bank..
until that moment, he didn't exist.
except on paper. - May I help you?
he had all the proper ID...
driver's license, birth certificate, Social Security card...
and the signature was a spot-on match.
I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business.
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.
thank you.
I'm sure I will.
here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else?
please.
would you add this to your outgoing mail?
I'd be happy to.
good day, sir.
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.
all told, he blew town with better than $370, 000 of Warden Norton's money.
severance pay for 19 years.
good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.
Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.
if you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.
I wasn't there to see, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl when they took him away.
norton had no intention of going that quietly.
samuel Norton.
we have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.
open the door.
I'm not sure which key.
make it easy on yourself, Norton!
I like to think the last thing that went through his head other than that bullet was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.
not long after the warden deprived us of his company I got a postcard in the mail.
it was blank, but the postmark said Fort Hancock, Texas.
fort Hancoc right on the border.
that's where Andy crossed.
when I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down, it always makes me laugh.
Andy Dufresne
who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side.
Hadley's got him by the throat, right?
he says, " I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident."
those of us who knew him best talk about him often.
I swear, the stuff he pulled...
my friends could use a couple of beers.
and he got it!
sometimes it makes me sad, though Andy being gone.
I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.
their feathers are just too bright.
and when they fly away the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.
but still the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.
I guess I just miss my friend.
please sit down.
Ellis Boyd Redding your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.
you feel you've been rehabilitated?
rehabilitated?
well, now, let me see.
I don't have any idea what that means.
it means you're ready to rejoin society...
I know what you think it means, Sonny.
to me it's just a made-up word.
a politician's word so that young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie and have a job.
what do you really want to know?
am I sorry for what I did?
well, are you?
there's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.
not because I'm in here or because you think I should.
I look back on the way I was then a young stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.
I want to talk to him.
I want to try and talk some sense to him.
tell him the way things are.
but I can't.
that kid's long gone and this old man is all that's left.
I got to live with that.
rehabilitated?
it's just a bullshit word.
so you go on and stamp your forms, sonny, and stop wasting my time.
because to tell you the truth...
...I don't give a shit.
here you go, miss.
restroom break?
you don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go.
yes
forty years I've been asking permission to piss.
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.
there's a harsh truth to face.
no way I'm going to make it on the outside.
all I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole so maybe they'd send me back.
terrible thing, to live in fear.
Brooks Hatlen knew it.
knew it all too well.
all I want is to be back where things make sense.
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.
only one thing stops me.
a promise I made to Andy.
there it is.
much obliged, sir.
dear Red:
if you're reading this, you've gotten out and if you've come this far, maybe you'd come a bit further
you remember the name of the town, don't you?
Zihuatanejo.
I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels.
I'll keep an eye out for you, and the chessboard ready.
remember, Red...
... Hope is a good thing...
... Maybe the best of things.
and no good thing ever dies.
I will be hoping that this letter finds you and finds you well.
your friend...
... Andy.
get busy living or get busy dying.
that's goddamn right.
for the second time in my life I'm guilty of committing a crime.
parole violation.
of course I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that.
not for an old crook like me.
fort Hancock, Texas, please.
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.
I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel.
a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain.
I hope I can make it across the border.
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.
I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.
I hope.
return to your cellblocks for evening count.
all prisoners report for lock down.
what?
Where's he going? - Grab his ankles.
no... Help!
two things never happened again after that.
the Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again.
and Bogs would never walk again.
they transferred him to a minimum-security hospital upstate.
to my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days...
... drinking his food through a straw.
Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary.
sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.
the man likes to play chess.
let's get him some rocks.
guys!
I got one.
I got one. Look!
heywood, that isn't soapstone! And it ain't alabaster either.
what are you, a fucking geologist?
he's right. It ain't.
what the hell is it then? - It's a horse apple.
bullshit! - No, horseshit.
petrified.
God
Damn!
despite a few hitches, the boys came through in fine style.
and by the weekend he was due back...
... we had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till rapture.
also got a big shipment in that week.
cigarettes...
... chewing gum...
... sipping whisky...
... playing cards with naked ladies on them. You name it.
and of course, the most important item:
Rita Hayworth herself.
everybody awakes
heads up. They're tossing cells.
heads up. They're tossing cells!
119
123
on your feet.
face the wall.
turn around and face the warden.
pleased to see you reading this.
any favorite passages?
watch ye, therefore, for ye know not...
...when the master of the house cometh.
mark 13: 35.
I've always liked that one.
but I prefer...
..." I am the light of the world.
ye that followeth me shall have the light of life.
John, chapter 8, verse 12.
I hear you're good with numbers.
how nice.
man should have a skill.
explain this.
it's called a rock blanket. It's for shaping and polishing rocks.
a little hobby of mine.
it's pretty clean.
some contraband here, but nothing to get in a twist over.
I can't say I approve of this.
but I suppose...
...exceptions can be made.
lock them up!
I almost forgot.
I'd hate to deprive you of this.
salvation lies within.
Yes, sir.
tossing cells was just an excuse.
truth is...
... Norton wanted to size Andy up.
my wife made that in church group.
very nice, sir.
you enjoy working the laundry?
no, sir. Not especially.
perhaps we can find something more...
......befitting a man of your education.
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?
I thought I heard you out here.
I've been reassigned to you.
I know, they told me.
ain't that a kick in the head?
well, I'll give you the dime tour.
come on.
well, here she is.
the Shawshank Prison Library.
national Geographics...
...Reader's Digest condensed books...
...and Louis L'Amour.
look magazine.
Erle Stanley Gardners.
every evening I load up the cart and make my rounds.
I enter the names on this clipboard here.
easy, peasy, Japanese-y.
any questions? - How long have you been librarian?
I come here in '05, and they made me librarian in 1912.
and have you ever had an assistant?
no. Not much to it, really.
why me? Why now?
I don't know.
but it'd be nice to have some company down here.
Dufresne
that's him. That's the one.
I'm Dekins.
I was thinking...
...about setting up some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.
I see.
why don't we have a seat and talk it over.
do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?
Thanks.
so...
mister Dekins...
and then Andy says, " Mr. Dekins...
...do you want your sons to go to Harvard or Yale?
he didn't say that!
as God as my witness!
Dekins blinked for a second...
...then he laughed and actually shook Andy's hand.
my ass! - Shook his hand.
I tell you, I near soiled myself!
all he needed was a suit and tie and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...
...He'd have been "Mr. Dufresne," if you please.
making a few friends?
I wouldn't say "friends.
I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.
it's a wonderful pet to have.
got you out of the laundry, though.
it might do more than that.
how about expanding the library. Get some new books.
if you ask for something, ask for a pool table.
right
how do you expect to do that? I mean...
...get new books in here, "Mr. Dufresne, if you please.
I'll ask the warden for funds.
six wardens have been through here in my tenure, and I've learned...
...one immutable, universal truth:
not one born whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you ask for funds.
the budget's stretched thin as it is. - I see.
maybe I could write the state senate and request funds from them.
they have only three ways to spend the taxpayers' money for prisons:
more walls, more bars, more guards.
I'd like to try, with permission. A letter a week.
they can't ignore me forever. - Sure can.
but you write your letters if it makes you happy.
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?
so Andy started writing a letter a week...
... just like he said.
and like Norton said...
... Andy got no answers.
the following April, he did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.
year after that, he did them all...
... including the warden's.
year after that, they rescheduled the intramural season...
... to coincide with tax season.
the guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2s.
so Moresby Prison issued you a gun, but you paid for it
right. The holster too.
that's tax-deductible. You can write that off.
Yes, sir! Andy was a regular cottage industry.
in fact, it got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.
could you hand me a stack of 1040s?
got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.
and still, he kept sending those letters.
red, Andy, It's Brooks.
watch the door.
please, Brooks.
calm the fuck down. - Stay back!
stay back, goddamn it! - What's going on?
one second he's fine, then out come the knives.
we can talk about this, right?
there's nothing to talk about. I'll cut his fucking throat.
what's he done to you?
it's what they done!
I got no choice.
you won't hurt Heywood. We all know that.
right, Heywood? - Sure.
he's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.
right, guys?
so put the knife down. Look at me.
put the knife down.
look at his neck, for God's sake.
look at his neck. He's bleeding.
it's the only way...
...they'd let me stay.
this is crazy. You don't want to do this.
put it, put it down.
take it easy.
you'll be all right.
him? What about me?
crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!
you've had worse from shaving.
what did you do to set him off?
nothing. I come in here to say farewell.
ain't you heard? His parole's come through.
I just don't understand what happened in there.
old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.
that's enough out of you.
heard he had you shitting your pants. - Fuck you.
IKnock it off.
Brooks ain't no bug.
he is only...
he's just institutionalized.
"Institutionalized," my ass.
the man's been in here 50 years, Heywood, 50 years!
this is all he knows.
in here, he's an important man an educated man.
outside, he's nothing.
just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.
probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.
you know what I'm trying to say?
I do believe you're talking out of your ass.
you believe whatever you want.
but I tell you these walls are funny.
first you hate them.
then you get used to them.
enough time passes...
...you get so you depend on them.
that's "institutionalized."
shit.
I could never get like that. - Oh, yeah?
wait till you've been here as long as Brooks.
goddamn right.
they send you here for life...
...that's exactly what they take.
part that counts, anyway.
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.
you go on now.
you're free.
you're free.
good luck, Brooksie.
taking care
dear fellas:
I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.
watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?
I saw an automobile once when I was a kid...
... but now they're everywhere.
the world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.
the parole board got me into this halfway house called "The Brewer"and a job bagging groceries at the Food-Way.
it's hard work and I try to keep up...
... but my hands hurt most of the time.
make sure your man double-bags.
last time, the bottom near came out.
make sure you double-bag like the lady says. Understand?
Yes, sir. Surely will.
I don't think the store manager likes me very much.
sometimes after work, I go to the park and feed the birds.
I keep thinking...
... Jake might just show up and say hello.
but he never does.
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.
I have trouble sleeping at night.
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.
I wake up scared.
sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.
maybe I should get a gun and rob the Food-Way so they'd send me home.
I could shoot the manager while I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.
I don't like it here.
I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided...
... not to stay.
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...
... not for an old crook like me.
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss, not for an old crook like me.
P. S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.
no hard feelings. Brooks.
he should have died in here.
what the fuck have you done?
it's a goddamn mess, I'll tell you that.
what's all this? - You tell me. They're addressed to you.
take it.
dear Mr. Dufresne:
in response to your inquiries...
...the state has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project.
this is $ 200.
in addition, the library district has generously responded...
...with a donation of used books and sundries.
we trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed.
please stop sending us letters.
clear all this out before the warden gets back.
Yes, sir.
good for you, Andy.
Wow!
it only took six years.
from now on, I'll write two letters a week instead of one.
I believe you're crazy enough. Get this stuff out...
...like he said. I've got to pinch a loaf.
when I come back...
...this is all gone, all right?
do you hear that?
Dufresne!
Andy, let me out!
Andy
I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.
truth is, I don't want to know.
some things are best left unsaid.
I like to think it was something so beautiful...
... it can't be expressed in words...
... and makes your heart ache because of it.
I tell you, those voices soared...
... higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.
it was like a beautiful bird flapped into our drab cage...
... and made those walls dissolve away.
and for the briefest of moments...
... Every last man at Shawshank felt free.
it pissed the warden off something awful.
open the door.
open it up!
Dufresne, open this door!
turn that off!
I am warning you. Turn that off!
Dufresne
you're mine now.
Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.
on your feet.
Hey, look who's here. - Maestro!
you couldn't play something good, huh? Like Hank Williams?
they broke the door down before I could take requests.
was it worth two weeks? - Easiest time I ever did.
no such thing as easy time in the hole. - A week in the hole is like a year.
damn straight. - I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.
so they let you tote that record player down there, huh?
it was in here.
in here.
that's the beauty of music. They...
...can't get that from you.
haven't you ever felt that way about music?
well, I played a mean harmonica as a younger man.
lost interest in it, though.
didn't make much sense in here.
here's where it makes the most sense.
you need it so you don't forget.
forget?
forget that there are...
...places...
...in the world that aren't made out of stone.
there's something...
...inside...
...that they can't get to...
...that they can't touch.
that's yours.
what are you talking about?
hope.
hope.
let me tell you something, my friend.
hope is a dangerous thing.
hope can drive a man insane.
it's got no use on the inside.
you'd better get used to that idea.
like Brooks did?
sit down.
says here that you've served 30 years of a life sentence.
you feel you've been rehabilitated?
Oh, yes, sir.
without a doubt.
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.
no danger to society here.
God's honest truth.
absolutely rehabilitated.
thirty years.
Jesus, when you say it like that...
you wonder where it went.
I wonder where 10 years went.
here.
a little parole rejection present.
go ahead and open it.
went through one of your competitors.
I hope you don't mind. I wanted it to be a surprise.
it's very pretty.
thank you.
you going to play it?
no.
not right now.
roll in!
lights out!
Andy was as good as his word.
he wrote two letters a week instead of one.
in 1959, the state senate finally clued in to the fact...
... they couldn't buy him off with just a $ 200 check.
appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of $500...
... just to shut him up.
and you'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it.
he made deals with book clubs, charity groups.
he bought remaindered books by the pound...
treasure Island.
robert Louis...
Stevenson.
fiction, adventure.
what's next?
I got here Auto Repair...
...and Soap Carving.
trade skills and hobbies. Under "Educational," behind you.
count of Monte Crisco.
that's "Cristo," you dumb shit.
by Alexandree...
...Dum-ass.
dumb ass.
dumb ass?
Dumas. I Know what that's about?
you'd like it. It's about a prison break.
we ought to file that under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?
the rest of us did our best to pitch in when and where we could.
by the year Kennedy was shot...
... Andy had transformed a storage room smelling of turpentine...
... into the best prison library in New England...
... complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.
that was also when Warden Norton...
... instituted his famous "Inside Out" program.
you may remember reading about it.
it made the papers and got his picture in Look magazine.
it's no free ride...
but rather a genuine progressive advance in corrections and rehabilitation..
our inmates, properly supervised...
...will be put to work outside these walls...
...performing all manner of public service.
these men can learn the value of an honest day's labor and provide a service to the community.....
...at a bare minimum of expense to Mr. And Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.
of course he didn't tell the press...
... that "bare minimum of expense" is a fairly loose term.
there are 100 different ways to skim off the top.
men, materials, you name it.
and oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in!
at this rate, you'll put me out of business.
with this pool of slave labor, you can underbid any contractor in town.
we're providing a valuable community service.
that's fine for the papers, but I've got a family to feed.
we go back a long way.
I need this highway contract. I don't get it and I go under. That's a fact.
you have some of this fine pie my missus made for you. You think about that。
I wouldn't worry too much about this contract.
I already got my boys committed elsewhere.
you be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.
and behind every shady deal...
... behind every dollar earned...
... there was Andy, keeping the books.
two deposits.
Maine National and New England First. Night drops as always, sir.
get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
if they over-starch my shirts again, they'll hear from me.
how do I look?
very nice. - Big charity to-do up Portland way. - Governor will be there.
you want the rest of this?
woman can't bake worth shit.
thank you, sir.
he's got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.
he's got scams you haven't even dreamed of. I Kickbacks on his kickbacks.
a river of dirty money running through here.
sooner or later, he'll have to explain where it came from.
that's where I come in.
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.
stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.
I send it out into the real world, and when it comes back...
clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh? - Cleaner.
by the time Norton retires, I'll have made him a millionaire.
if they ever catch on, he'll wind up in here wearing a number himself.
I thought you had more faith in me than that.
I know you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail.
now anybody gets curious, FBI, IRS...
...whatever.
it'll lead to somebody.
sure it is, but not to me, and certainly not to the warden.
all right, who?
Randall Stevens.
who?
the "silent" silent partner.
he's the guilty one, the man with the bank accounts.
it's where the filtering process starts.
they trace anything, it'll just lead to him.
but who is he?
he's a phantom, an apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.
I conjured him...
...out of thin air.
he doesn't exist, except on paper.
you can't just make a person up.
sure you can, if you know how the system works.
it's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...
...driver's license, Social Security.
you're shitting me.
if they trace any accounts, they'll wind up chasing...
...a figment of my imagination.
well, I'll be damned!
did I say you were good?
shit, you are Rembrandt.
the funny thing is...
...on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow.
I had to come to prison to be a crook.
ever bother you?
I don't run the scams. I just process the profits.
a fine line, maybe...
...but I also built that library...
...and used it to help guys get their high school diploma.
why do you think he lets me do all that?
keep you happy and doing the laundry money instead of sheets.
well, I work cheap. That's the tradeoff.
Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965...
... on a two-year stretch for B and E.
that's breaking and entering to you.
cops caught him sneaking TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney.
young punk.
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...
... cocky as hell.
come on, old boys. Moving like molasses!
making me look bad.
we liked him immediately.
I'm backing out the door and I got the TV like this.
a big old thing. I couldn't see shit. Then I hear this voice.
freeze, kid, hands in the air.
I was standing there, holding onto that TV. Finally the voice says:
you hear what I said, boy?" I say, " Yes, sir. I did.
but if I drop this, you get me on destruction of property too.
you done some stretch in Cashman, right?
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time, let me tell you.
weekend furloughs. Work programs.
not like here.
sounds like you done time all over.
I've been in and out since I was 13.
name it, chances are I've been there.
perhaps you should try a new profession.
what I mean is...
...you're not a very good thief. You should try something else.
Yeah, what the hell you know about it, Capone?
what are you in for?
me?
a lawyer fucked me.
everybody's innocent in here. Don't you know that?
as it turned out, Tommy had himself a young wife and a new baby girl.
maybe he thought of them on the streets...
... or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.
whatever it was...
... something lit a fire under that boy's ass.
thought I might try for my high school equivalency.
hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.
I ain't no goddamn loser.
you mean that? - Yeah.
you really mean that?
Yes, sir, I do.
good. Because if we do this...
...we do it all the way, a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.
thing is, see...
...I don't read so good.
well.
you don't read...
...so well.
we'll get to that.
so Andy took Tommy under his wing.
started walking him through his ABC's.
Tommy took to it pretty well too.
boy found brains he never knew he had.
before long, Andy started him on his course requirements.
he really liked the kid.
gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shit heap.
but that wasn't the only reason.
prison time is slow time.
so you do what you can to keep going.
some fellas collect stamps.
others build matchstick houses.
Andy built a library.
now he needed a new project.
Tommy was it.
it was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks.
the same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.
in prison...
... a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.
by 1966, right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams...
... it was lovely Raquel.
time.
well?
well, it's for shit.
I wasted a whole year of my time with this bullshit.
it's probably not that bad.
I didn't get a thing right. It might as well have been in Chinese.
let's see how the score comes out.
I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out.
two points, right there!
there's your goddamn score!
goddamn cats crawling up trees, 5 times 5 is 25...
fuck this place!
fuck it!
I feel bad.
I let him down.
that's crap, kid.
he's proud of you.
we're old friends, I know him as good as anybody.
smart fellow, ain't he?
smart as they come. He was a banker on the outside.
what's he in here for anyway?
murder.
the hell, you say.
you wouldn't think it to look at the guy.
caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased them both.
what?
about four years ago...
...I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.
I stole a car.
it was a dumb-fuck thing to do.
about six months left to go...
...I get a new cellmate in.
Elmo Blatch.
big, twitchy fucker.
kind of roomie you pray you don't get. You know what I'm saying?
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.
said he pulled hundreds of jobs.
hard to believe, high-strung as he was. You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.
talked all the time too. That's the other thing. He never shut up.
places he'd been in...
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.
even people he killed.
people who "gave him shit.
that's how he put it.
so one night, like a joke...
...I say to him, "Elmo, who did you kill?
so he says:
I got me this job one time, busing tables at a country club...
...so I could case all these big rich pricks that come in.
so I pick out this guy...
...go in one night...
...and do his place.
he wakes up...
...and gives me shit.
so I killed him.
him and this tasty bitch he was with.
and that's the best part.
she's fucking this prick, see...
...this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy.
some hotshot banker.
and he's the one they pinned it on.
I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.
what amazes me most is you'd be taken in by it.
sir?
it's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you.
he hears your tale of woe and naturally wants to cheer you up.
he's young, not terribly bright.
it's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.
sir, he's telling the truth.
let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist.
you think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, " Yes, I did it. I confess.
by the way, add a life term to my sentence.
with Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.
that's assuming Blatch is still there.
chances are, he'd be released by now.
they'd have his last known address. It's a chance, isn't it?
how can you be so obtuse?
what?
what did you call me?
obtuse. Is it deliberate?
you're forgetting yourself.
the country club will have his old timecards.
records, W-2s with his name on them.
if you want to indulge this fantasy, it's your business.
don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
if I got out, I'd never mention what happens here.
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering that money.
don't ever mention money to me, you son of a bitch!
not in this office...
...not anywhere. Get in here, now!
I just wanted to put you at ease, that's all.
solitary. A month.
what's wrong with you? Get him out of here.
this is my chance to get out! It's my life! Understand?!
get him out!
a month in the hole.
that's the longest stretch I ever heard of.
it's all my fault.
bullshit.
you didn't pull the trigger or convict him.
are you saying Andy is innocent?
I mean, for real innocent?
it looks that way.
sweet Jesus.
how long has he been here now?
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.
Williams, Thomas. - Yeah, over here.
what you got?
board of Education.
that son of a bitch mailed it.
you going to open it or stand there with your thumb up your butt?
thumb up my butt sounds better.
Skeets, come on. Give me that, you shithead.
Floyd, come on.
red
will you throw that away, please?
well, shit.
the kid passed. C + average.
thought you'd like to know.
warden wants to talk.
out here?
that's what the man said.
warden?
Tommy
I'm asking you to keep this conversation just between us.
I feel awkward enough as it is.
we got a situation here.
I think you can appreciate that.
Yes, sir.
I sure can.
I tell you, son, this thing really came along and knocked my wind out.
it's got me up nights. That's the truth.
the right thing to do...
...sometimes it's hard to know what that is.
do you understand?
I need your help, son.
if I'm going to move on this...
...there can't be the least little shred of doubt.
I have to know...
...if what you told Dufresne was the truth.
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury...
...with your hand on the Good Book...
...and take an oath before Almighty God himself?
just give me that chance.
that's what I thought.
I'm sure by now you've heard.
terrible thing.
a man that young...
...less than a year to go, trying to escape.
broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.
truly, it did.
we just have to put it behind us.
move on.
I'm done.
everything stops.
get someone else to run your scams.
nothing stops.
nothing.
or you will do the hardest time there is.
no more protection from the guards.
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton and cast you down with the sodomites.
you'll think you've been fucked by a train.
and the library?
gone.
sealed off, brick by brick.
we'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.
they'll see the flames for miles.
we'll dance around it like wild Injuns.
you understand me? Catching my drift?
or am I being obtuse?
give him another month to think about it.
my wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.
like a closed book.
complained about it all the time.
she was beautiful.
God, I loved her.
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.
I killed her, Red.
I didn't pull the trigger...
...but I drove her away.
that's why she died, because of me...
...the way I am.
that don't make you a murderer.
bad husband, maybe.
feel bad about it if you want, but you didn't pull the trigger.
no, I didn't.
somebody else did.
and I wound up in here.
bad luck, I guess.
it floats around.
it's got to land on somebody.
it was my turn, that's all.
I was in the path of the tornado.
I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.
think you'll ever get out of here?
me?
Yeah.
one day, when I got a long, white beard...
...and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs.
I tell you where I'd go.
Zihuatanejo.
say what?
Zihuatanejo.
it's in Mexico.
a little place on the Pacific Ocean.
you know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?
they say it has no memory.
that's where I want to live the rest of my life.
a warm place with no memory.
open up a little hotel right on the beach.
buy some worthless old boat...
...and fix it up new.
take my guests out...
...charter fishing.
Zihuatanejo.
in a place like that, I could use a man that knows how to get things.
I don't think I could make it on the outside.
I been in here most of my life.
I'm an institutional man now.
just like Brooks was.
you underestimate yourself.
I don't think so.
in here I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure, but...
...outside all you need is the Yellow Pages.
hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.
pacific Ocean?
shit.
scare me to death, something that big.
not me.
I didn't shoot my wife, and I didn't shoot her lover.
whatever mistakes I made, I've paid for them and then some.
that hotel, that boat...
I don't think that's too much to ask.
you shouldn't be doing this to yourself.
this is just shitty pipe dreams.
mexico is way down there and you're in here...
...and that's the way it is.
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.
it's down there and I'm in here.
I guess it comes down to a simple choice.
get busy living...
...or get busy dying.
Andy
red
if you ever get out of here, do me a favor.
sure, Andy. Anything.
there's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?
a lot of hayfields up there. - One in particular.
it's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end.
it's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.
it's where I asked my wife to marry me.
we went there for a picnic...
...and made love under that oak...
...and I asked and she said yes.
promise me, Red.
if you ever get out...
...find that spot.
at the base of that wall, there's a rock that has no earthly business in Maine.
piece of black, volcanic glass.
something's buried under it I want you to have.
what, Andy?
what's buried under there?
you'll have to pry it up...
...to see.
no, I'm telling you. The guy is...
he's talking funny.
I'm really worried about him.
let's keep an eye on him.
that's fine during the day, but at night he's all alone.
Oh, Lord.
what?
Andy come down to the loading dock today.
he asked me for a length of rope.
rope? Six feet long.
and you gave it to him.
sure. Why wouldn't I?
Jesus! Heywood. How was I supposed to know?
remember Brooks Hatlen?
Andy would never do that.
never.
I don't know.
every man has his breaking point.
Lickety-split. Want to get home.
just about finished, sir.
three deposits tonight.
get my stuff down to the laundry.
and shine my shoes.
I want them looking like mirrors. - Yes, sir.
it's good having you back.
place wasn't the same without you.
lights out!
I've had some long nights in stir.
alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts...
... time can draw out like a blade.
that was the longest night of my life.
give me a count!
tier 3 south, clear!
tier 3 north, clear!
man missing on tier 2, cell 245!
Dufresne!
come out. You're holding up the show!
don't make me come down or I'll thump your skull for you!
damn it, you're putting me behind! I got a schedule to keep.
you'd better be sick or dead in there. I shit you not!
you hear me?
Oh, my Holy God.
I want every man on this cellblock questioned.
start with that friend of his. - Who?
he
open 237.
what do you mean, "He just wasn't here"? Don't say that to me.
don't tell me that again.
but sir, he wasn't.
I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?
is that what you're saying?
am I blind, Haig? - No, sir!
what about you. You blind?
tell me what this is. - Last night's count.
you see Dufresne's name there? I sure do. Right there.
Dufresne.
he was in his cell at lights out.
reasonable he'd be here in the morning.
I want him found.
not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!
Yes, sir.
let's go. Move your butts.
stand.
well?
well, what?
I see you two all the time. You're thick as thieves, you are.
he must have said something.
no, sir, Warden.
not a word.
Lord, it's a miracle!
man vanished like a fart in the wind.
nothing left...
...but some damn rocks on a windowsill.
and that cupcake on the wall. Let's ask her.
maybe she knows.
what say there, fuzzy-britches? Feel like talking?
guess not.
why should she be any different?
this is a conspiracy.
that's what this is.
one big, damn conspiracy!
and everyone's in on it!
including her!
in 1966...
... Andy Dufresne escaped...
... from Shawshank Prison.
all they found was a muddy set of prison clothes...
... a bar of soap...
... and an old rock hammer...
... damn near worn down to the nub.
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.
old Andy did it in less than 20.
Oh, Andy loved geology.
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.
an ice age here million years of mountain building there.
geology is the study of pressure and time.
that's all it takes, really.
pressure...
... and time.
that and a big goddamn poster.
like I said...
... in prison, a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.
seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard...
... a handful at a time.
I guess after Tommy was killed...
... Andy decided he'd been here long enough.
Lickety-split. I want to get home.
I'm just about finished, sir.
three deposits tonight.
Andy did like he was told.
buffed those shoes to a high mirror-shine.
the guards simply didn't notice.
neither did I.
I mean, seriously...
... how often do you really look at a man's shoes?
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards...
... of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.
or maybe I just don't want to.
five hundred yards.
that's the length of five football fields.
just shy of half a mile.
the next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her secret...
... a man nobody ever laid eyes on before...
... strolled into the Maine National Bank.
until that moment, he didn't exist.
except on paper. - May I help you?
he had all the proper ID...
... driver's license, birth certificate, Social Security card...
and the signature was a spot-on match.
I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business.
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.
thank you.
I'm sure I will.
here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else?
please.
would you add this to your outgoing mail?
I'd be happy to.
good day, sir.
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.
all told, he blew town...
... with better than $370, 000 of Warden Norton's money.
severance pay for 19 years.
good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.
Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.
if you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.
I wasn't there to see, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...
... when they took him away.
norton had no intention of going that quietly.
samuel Norton.
we have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.
open the door.
I'm not sure which key.
make it easy on yourself, Norton!
I like to think the last thing that went through his head...
... other than that bullet...
... was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.
not long after the warden deprived us of his company...
... I got a postcard in the mail.
it was blank, but the postmark said...
... Fort Hancock, Texas.
fort Hancock...
... right on the border.
that's where Andy crossed.
when I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down...
... it always makes me laugh.
Andy Dufresne...
... who crawled through a river of shit...
... and came out clean on the other side.
Andy Dufresne...
... headed for the Pacific.
Hadley's got him by the throat, right?
he says, " I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident.
those of us who knew him best talk about him often.
I swear, the stuff he pulled...
my friends could use a couple of beers.
and he got it!
sometimes it makes me sad, though Andy being gone.
I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.
their feathers are just too bright.
and when they fly away...
... the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.
but still ......
... the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.
I guess I just miss my friend.
please sit down.
Ellis Boyd Redding...
...your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.
you feel you've been rehabilitated?
rehabilitated?
well, now, let me see.
I don't have any idea what that means.
it means you're ready to rejoin society...
I know what you think it means, sonny.
to me it's just a made-up word.
a politician's word so that...
...Young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie...
...and have a job.
what do you really want to know?
am I sorry for what I did?
well, are you?
there's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.
not because I'm in here or because you think I should.
I look back on the way I was then...
...a young...
...Stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.
I want to talk to him.
I want to try and talk some sense to him.
tell him the way things are.
but I can't.
that kid's long gone...
...and this old man is all that's left.
I got to live with that.
rehabilitated?
it's just a bullshit word.
so you go on and stamp your forms, sonny, and stop wasting my time.
because to tell you the truth...
...I don't give a shit.
here you go, miss.
restroom break?
you don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go.
yes sir
forty years I've been asking permission to piss.
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.
there's a harsh truth to face.
no way I'm going to make it on the outside.
all I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole...
... So maybe they'd send me back.
terrible thing, to live in fear.
Brooks Hatlen knew it.
knew it all too well.
all I want is to be back where things make sense.
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.
only one thing stops me.
a promise I made to Andy.
there it is.
much obliged, sir.
dear Red:
if you're reading this, you've gotten out...
... And if you've come this far, maybe you'd come a bit further.
you remember the name of the town, don't you?
Zihuatanejo.
I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels.
I'll keep an eye out for you, and the chessboard ready.
remember, Red...
... Hope is a good thing...
... maybe the best of things.
and no good thing ever dies.
I will be hoping that this letter finds you...
... And finds you well.
your friend...
... Andy.
get busy living...
... Or get busy dying.
that's goddamn right.
for the second time in my life...
... I'm guilty of committing a crime.
parole violation.
of course I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that.
not for an old crook like me.
fort Hancock, Texas, please.
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.
I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel.
a free man at the start of a long journey...
... whose conclusion is uncertain.
I hope I can make it across the border.
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.
I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.
I hope.
remember, remember the 5th of November
the gunpowder treason and plot
I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot
but what of the man?
I know his name was Guy Fawkes...
...and I know in 1605, he attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament.
but who was he really?
what was he like?
we are told to remember the idea and not the man.
because a man can fail.
he can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten.
but 400 years later...
...an idea can still change the world.
I have witnessed firsthand the power of ideas.
I've seen people kill in the name of them...
...and die defending them.
but you cannot kiss an idea...
...cannot touch it or hold it.
ideas do not bleed. They do not feel pain.
they do not love.
and it is not an idea that I miss.
it is a man.
a man that made me remember the 5th of November.
a man that I will never forget.
so I read that the former United States is so desperate for medical supplies...
...that they have allegedly sent several containers filled with wheat and tobacco.
a gesture, they said, of goodwill.
you wanna know what I think?
well, you're listening to my show, so I will assume you do.
it's high time we let the colonies know what we really think of them.
I think it's payback time for a little tea party they threw for us a few hundred years ago.
I say we go down to those docks tonight and dump that crap...
...where everything from the Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica belongs!
who's with me? Who's bloody with me?!
did you like that?
u.s.a. Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica. I mean, what else can you say?
here was a country that had everything, absolutely everything...
...and now, 20 years later, is what?
the world's biggest leper colony. Why?
godlessness.
let me say that again.
godlessness.
it wasrt the war they started. It wasrt the plague they created.
it was Judgment.
no one escapes their past. No one escapes Judgment.
you think he's not up there?
you think he's not watching over this country?
how else can you explain it? He tested us, but we came through.
we did what we had to do.
islington. Enfield. I was there. I saw it all.
immigrants, Muslims...
...homosexuals, terrorists.
disease-ridden degenerates. They had to go.
strength through unity. Unity through faith.
I am a God-fearing Englishman, and I'm goddamn proud of it!
that's quite enough of that, thank you very much.
Oh, shit.
a yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.
any unauthorized personnel will be subject to arrest.
this is for your protection.
a yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.
any unauthorized personnel will be subject to arrest.
this is for your protection.
excuse me. - Sorry, I didn't see you...
in a hurry, are we? - I was just...
it's past curfew, you know. - My uncle, he's very sick.
sick uncle? What you think on that, Willy? - It's a load of bollocks.
I made a mistake. I shouldn't be out after curfew. I know that.
maybe you could look after us before getting back to your uncle.
see, my friend, he's kind of sick. Ain't you?
real sick. Bad case of the blues. You can feel them.
don't touch me! - Look, Willy, kitty's got claws.
she just threatened us. - That she did, that she did.
you know what that means, don't you?
it means that we exercise our own judicial discretion.
and you get to swallow it.
you're Fingermen. - She's getting the picture.
no, please, I didn't know. I'm sorry.
not yet you're not. But you will be.
by sunup, if you're not the sorriest piece of ass in all of London...
...then you'll certainly be the sorest.
Oh, God, no. Please don't do this.
I'll go home. I won't do it again, I swear! Please!
what do you think, lads? - Spare the rod, spoil the child.
help me! Someone help!
the multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him.
what the hell?! - Bugger off!
disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel...
...which smoked with bloody execution.
we're Fingermen, pal.
Jesus Christ! Mercy!
we are oft to blame in this... 'Tis too much proved.
that with devotiors visage and pious action we do sugar o'er the devil himself.
what's that mean? - Spare the rod.
I can assure you, I mean you no harm.
who are you? - Who?
who is but the form following the function of what...
...and what I am is a man in a mask.
Oh, I can see that. - Of course you can.
I'm not questioning your powers of observation.
I'm merely remarking upon the paradox of asking a masked man who he is.
right. - But on this most auspicious of nights...
...permit me then, in lieu of the more commonplace sobriquet...
...to suggest the character of this dramatis persona.
voila!
in view, a humble vaudevillian veteran...
...cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of fate.
this visage, no mere veneer of vanity...
...is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished.
however, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified...
...and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice...
...and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition.
the only verdict is vengeance, a vendetta...
...held as a votive not in vain, for the value and veracity of such...
...shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.
verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose.
so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you...
...and you may call me V.
are you, like, a crazy person?
I am quite sure they will say so.
but to whom, might I ask, am I speaking?
I'm Evey. - Evey?
E-vey. Of course you are.
what does that mean? - It means that I, like God...
...do not play with dice and do not believe in coincidence.
are you hurt?
no, I'm fine.
thanks to you. - Oh, I merely played my part.
but tell me, do you enjoy music, Evey? - I suppose.
you see, I'm a musician of sorts...
...and on my way to give a very special performance.
what kind of musician?
percussion instruments are my speciality.
but tonight I intend to call upon the entire orchestra for this event...
...and would be honored if you could join me.
I don't think so. I should be getting home.
I promise you, it'll be like nothing you've ever seen.
and afterwards, you'll return home safely.
all right.
it's beautiful up here.
a more perfect stage could not be asked for.
I don't see any instruments.
your powers of observation continue to serve you well.
but wait. It is to Madame Justice that I dedicate this concerto...
...in honor of the holiday she seems to have taken from these parts...
...and in recognition of the imposter that stands in her stead.
tell me, do you know what day it is, Evey?
november the 4th? - Not anymore.
remember, remember The 5th of November
the gunpowder treason and plot
I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot
first, the overture.
Yes.
Yes, the strings.
listen carefully, can you hear it?
now the brass.
I can hear it!
look outside, Mommy! They're playing music!
how do you do that? - Wait.
here comes the crescendo!
how beautiful, is it not?
gentlemen, you have had four hours. You had better have results. Mr. Creedy.
the Bailey area is quarantined.
all significant witnesses have been detained.
good. Mr. Etheridge?
a recording device was found wired into the central emergency-broadcast system.
the DCD was Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.
add it to the blacklist. I never want to hear that again.
Yes, sir.
we also doubled our random sweeps and are monitoring phone surveillance...
...indicating a high percentage of conversation concerned with the explosion.
Mr. Dascomb, what are we doing about that?
we're calling it an emergency demolition.
we have spin coverage on the network and throughout the InterLink.
several experts have been lined up to testify against the Bailey's structural integrity.
I want Prothero to speak on the dangers of these old buildings...
...and how we must avoid clinging to the edifice of a decadent past.
he should conclude that the New Bailey will become the symbol of our time...
...and the future that our conviction has rewarded us.
Mr. Heyer.
our surveillance cameras captured several images of the terrorist...
...though the mask obviously makes retinal identification impossible.
we also managed to get a picture of the girl that Creedy's men were detaining.
who is she, Mr. Finch? - Not sure yet, sir.
but we're working on several leads. - Anything else?
we located the fireworks launch...
...and found traces of the explosives used at both sites.
unfortunately it appears that despite the heavy level of sophistication...
...these devices were homemade with over-the-counter chemicals...
...making them very difficult to trace.
whoever he is, chancellor, he's very good.
spare us your professional annotations, Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant.
apologies, chancellor.
gentlemen, this is a test.
moments such as these are matters of faith.
to fail is to invite doubt into everything we believe...
...everything we have fought for.
doubt will plunge this country back into chaos, and I will not let that happen.
gentlemen, I want this terrorist found...
...and I want him to understand what terror really means.
england prevails.
england prevails.
you think people will buy this? - Why not?
this is the BTN.
our job is to report the news, not fabricate it.
that's the government's job.
on the lighter side of things...
...seems that the crew responsible for the demolition of the Old Bailey...
...wanted to give the old girl a grand, albeit improvised, sendoff.
although the demolition had been planned for some time...
...the music and the fireworks were, according to the crew chief...
..."definitely not on the schedule." - We'll be right back.
do you believe that load of bollocks? I mean, there was no bloody demolition.
I saw it, the whole thing.
did you see it? - No. Last night I was...
Yeah, that's right. You went to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?
Evey, there you are.
you are still working for me. - Sorry, Patricia.
I need two espressos and three coffees.
and Deitrich is ready for his tea.
I don't get it.
why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask? Didrt Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?
it's not too late. He's still got another 16 hours.
maybe he's just getting started.
yeah?
okay. A lead on the girl.
look, don't get me wrong, I love it. A cow getting crucified.
it's hysterical. But you'll never get it approved.
you've got to rewrite it, okay? Gotta go.
I don't recall getting stood up by a more attractive woman.
Mr. Deitrich... - Gordon, please.
I don't need "mister" to make this body feel any older.
Gordon...
...I was on my way last night, but there were Fingermen...
...and I got scared and went home.
sadly, after last night, I think our curfew will only get worse.
gotcha.
Hey, Fred. - All that been x-rayed?
Nope. They're filled with bombs.
well, wait till commercials to set them off, okay?
I can't believe you watch that shit. - What?
laser Lass is banging.
what's all that?
not sure. They just arrived. Marked for Stage 3.
must be Prothero.
I wish someone had the balls to tell that brat this station ain't his playground.
what the hell is this?
just put them over there until I can figure out what they're for.
this looks serious. Her parents were political activists.
they were detained when she was 12. - What happened to her?
juvenile Reclamation Project...
...for five years. - Shit.
we're gonna need backup, but keep it minimal.
you sure about that, sir?
I want a chance to talk to her before she disappears into one of Creedy's black bags.
who's that?
don't piss me about. You show me ID, or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.
fucking hell.
come on, let's move!
you two, cover these elevators. The rest of you follow me.
attention. Attention.
will all personnel please evacuate the building.
this is not a drill.
will all personnel evacuate the building.
what the hell's going on?
it's jammed. - Break it down.
Dominic!
police! Out of the way!
get out the way!
damn it!
I'll tell you what I know. I'll tell you what I know.
I'll tell you what I know. England prevails.
clear the halls. - Sir.
help, Storm, help!
don't touch it.
dad, what's wrong with the telly?
good evening, London.
allow me first to apologize... - That's the emergency channel!
I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of the everyday routine...
...the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition.
bloody hell.
I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration...
who's that, Mum?
whereby important events of the past...
...usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful, bloody struggle...are celebrated with a nice holiday...
...I thought we could mark this November the 5th...a day that is, sadly, no longer remembered...by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat.
there are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
let me think, let me think.
even now, orders are being shouted into telephones...
...and men with guns will soon be on their way.
it's Chancellor Sutler. - Damn it!
Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation...
...words will always retain their power.
words offer the means to meaning...
...and, for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
and the truth is...
...there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
you designed it, wanted it foolproof. You said every television in London!
cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
and where once you had the freedom to object...
...to think and speak as you saw fit...
...you now have censors and surveillance coercing your conformity...
...and soliciting submission. - Cameras. We need cameras.
how did this happen? Who's to blame?
certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
and they will be held accountable.
but again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty...
...you need only look into a mirror.
I know why you did it.
I know you were afraid.
who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease.
there were a myriad of problems which conspired...
...to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
fear got the best of you.
and in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.
he promised you order, he promised you peace...
...and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
inspector, they're almost through. - Last night, I sought to end that silence.
last night, I destroyed the Old Bailey...
...to remind this country of what it has forgotten.
more than 400 years ago, a great citizen wished to imbed the 5th of November...
...forever in our memory.
his hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice and freedom...
...are more than words.
they are perspectives.
so if you've seen nothing...
...if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you...
...then I would suggest that you allow the 5th of November to pass unmarked.
but if you see what I see...
...if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek...
...then I ask you to stand beside me, one year from tonight...outside the gates of Parliament.
and together, we shall give them a 5th of November that shall never, ever be forgot.
kerosene fog. He's using our smoke machines.
cover the exits.
no one gets out. The rest of you, follow me.
left.
you go right.
spread out.
don't shoot! Please don't shoot!
hold your fire!
he put masks on all of us.
Jesus.
don't shoot! - Wait!
wait! - Hold your fire!
Freeze! Nobody move!
if you're wearing a mask, get down on your knees!
get their masks off. - Please hurry!
there's a bomb in the control booth.
Oh, no.
Jones, get anyone not wearing a mask out. - Yes, sir.
marshal, help carry this man. - Sir.
everyone else, let's go.
good God.
hurry up, you lot! Come on! Everybody out!
Dascomb.
have you any idea how long it would take to rebuild this facility?
do you have any idea what you're doing?
wait, wait!
don't shoot me, please! It's him! It's him!
on your knees! On your knees!
please! Please don't hurt me!
here we go.
I did it.
I did it.
Freeze!
get your hands on your head. Do it now or I shoot.
I must say that I am rather astonished by the response time of Londors finest.
I hadrt expected you to be quite so Johnny-on-the-spot.
we were here before you even started. Bad luck, chummy.
I don't know about that.
we're interrupting your regularly scheduled program to bring you this terrifying report...
...of a terrorist takeover of Jordan Tower which ended only moments ago.
a psychotic terrorist, identified only as the letter V...
...attacked the control booth with high-powered explosives and weapons...
...that he used against unarmed civilians in order to broadcast a message of hate.
we've just received this footage of a daring police raid.
stop! Stop, stay where you are, or we'll shoot! Stay where you are!
now, this is only an initial report...
...but at this time, it's believed that during this heroic raid...
...the terrorist was shot and killed.
bollocks.
again, from what we've been told by authorities, the danger is now over.
the terrorist is dead.
right there. What's he thinking?
is he considering leaving her?
after she just saved him?
he's a terrorist. You can't expect him to act like you or me.
some part of him's human.
and, for better or worse, she's stuck with him.
you scared me. - My apologies.
are you feeling all right? - Yes, thank you.
what is this place? - It's my home.
I call it the Shadow Gallery. - It's beautiful.
where did you get all this stuff? - Oh, here and there.
much of it from the vaults of the Ministry of Objectionable Materials.
you stole them? - Heavens, no.
stealing implies ownership.
you can't steal from the censor. I merely reclaimed them.
God, if they ever find this place...
I suspect if they do, a few bits of art will be the least of my worries.
you mean, after what you've done.
God, what have I done?
I maced that detective. Why did I do that?
you did what you thought was right. - No, I shouldn't have done that.
I must have been out of my mind.
is that what you really think, or what they'd want you to think?
I think I should go.
may I ask where? - Home. I have to go home.
they're looking for you. If they know where you work, they know where you live.
I have friends, I could stay with them. - I'm afraid that won't work either.
you have to understand, Evey, I didn't want this for either of us...
...but I couldn't see any other way.
you were unconscious and I had to make a decision.
if I had left you there, right now you'd be in one of Creedy's interrogation cells.
they'd imprison you, torture you, and, in all probability, kill you in the pursuit of finding me....
after what you did, I couldn't let that happen...
...so I picked you up and carried you to the only place I knew you'd be safe:
here, to my home.
I won't tell anyone, I swear. You know you can trust me.
I'm sorry, but I can't take that risk.
but I don't even know where this is.
you know it's underground. You know the color of the stone.
that'd be enough for a clever man. - Are you saying that I have to stay here?
only until I'm done. After the 5th, I no longer think it'll matter.
you mean a year from now?
I have to stay here for a year?
sorry, Evey. I didn't know what else to do.
you should've left me alone.
why didn't you just leave me alone?!
anything else on the parents? - Yeah, it ain't good.
they were interned at Belmarsh.
Oh, no. - Yeah.
she died in a hunger strike. He died when the military retook the shed.
and that ain't the worst of it. Her brother was at St. Mary's.
Christ. - It's nothing but bad luck here.
so we know her story. Now we need his.
I just wanted to apologize for my reaction last night.
I understand what you did for me, and I want you to know I am grateful.
your hands.
Yes.
there, that's better.
I hope I didn't put you off your appetite.
no, please. It's just... Are you all right? - Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine.
can I ask what happened?
there was a fire. A long time ago.
ancient history, for some.
not really very good table conversation.
now, would you care for a cup of tea with your egg?
Yes, thank you. I'm starving, actually. - Have a seat.
it's delicious. - Good.
God, I haven't had real butter since I was a little girl.
where did you get it?
a government supply train on its way to Chancellor Sutler.
you stole this from Chancellor Sutler? - Yes.
you're insane.
I dare do all that may become a man. Who dares more is none.
Macbeth. - Very good.
my mum, she used to read all his plays to me...
...and ever since, I've always wanted to act.
be in plays, movies.
when I was 9, I played viola in Twelfth Night. Mum was very proud.
where is your mother now?
she's dead.
I'm sorry.
can I ask about what you said on the telly? - Yes.
did you mean it? - Every word.
you really think blowing up Parliament's going to make this country a better place?
there's no certainty, only opportunity.
you can be pretty certain that if anyone does show up...
...Creedy'll black-bag every one of them.
people should not be afraid of their governments.
governments should be afraid of their people.
and you'll make that happen by blowing up a building?
the building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it.
symbols are given power by people.
alone, a symbol is meaningless, but with enough people...
...blowing up a building can change the world.
I wish I believed that was possible.
but every time I've seen this world change, it's always been for the worse.
I'll tell you what I know. I know this is not a man.
what is he? - A man does not wear a mask.
what is he? - A man does not threaten innocent civilians.
he's what every gutless, freedom-hating terrorist is:
a goddamn coward!
there will be no negotiation.
when I arrive in the morning, the Paddy will be gone.
I'm looking at the tape right now, and he has no idea how to light me.
my nose looks like Big fucking Ben.
listen to me, you bleeding sod, England prevails because I say it does!
so does every lazy cunt on this show, and that includes you.
find another DOP or find yourself another job.
I'll tell you what I wish.
I wish I'd been there.
I wish I'd had the chance for a face-to-face.
just one chance, that's all I'd need.
this so-called V and his accomplice, Evey Hammond...
...neo-demagogues, spouting their message of hate.
a delusional and aberrant voice delivering a terrorist's ultimatum.
an ultimatum that was met with swift and surgically precise justice.
no mercy! - The moral, ladies and gentlemen, is:
good guys win, bad guys lose...
...and, as always, England prevails!
holy Christ! Jesus!
good evening, Commander Prothero.
Oh, my God! How did you get in here?
don't worry, I've made sure our reunion won't be disturbed by...
...any pesky late-night phone calls, commander.
stop. Why do you keep calling me that?
that was your title, remember? When we first met, all those years ago.
you wore a uniform in those days.
you.
it is you. - The Ghost of Christmas Past.
yeah? - Finch, it's Dascomb.
Dascomb. - I've already called the chancellor.
we have to get control of the situation. - What situation?
chancellor Sutler agreed, for obvious reasons, we have to keep this discreet.
in the wrong light, the loss of the Voice of London...
...could be devastating to our credibility.
perhaps a stroke?
no, no, it's too horrific.
a quiet, dignified death in his sleep.
we got any eyes or ears on this? - No, camcos were cut.
it's the same m.o. as before. But we got an elevator log ID.
let me guess. - She's in deep, inspector.
my fat, metal friend.
Mondego.
Oh, God. I hope I didn't wake you.
no, I just thought you were fighting. I mean, for real.
my favorite film:
the Count of Monte Cristo, with Robert Donat as Edmond Dantes.
it is not my sword, Mondego, but your past that disarmed you.
it gets me every time.
never seen it. - Really?
would you like to? - Does it have a happy ending?
as only celluloid can deliver.
okay.
put the sword away.
forensics just wrapped.
no prints, no hair, no fibers. The guy is like a ghost.
you won't believe what they found on Prothero.
drugs? - Could've started his own hospital.
interesting. - Why?
did you know Lewis Prothero was one of the richest men in the country before he was the Voice of London?
drugs? - Legal ones.
major stockholder in Viadoxic Pharmaceutical.
Viadoxic and St. Mary's in less than a week. Coincidence?
when you're at this as long as I've been, you stop believing in coincidence.
may we come up?
you find your own tree. - You find your own tree.
did you like it? - Yeah.
but it made me feel sorry for Mercedes. - Why?
because he cared more about revenge than he did about her.
nationwide were devastated as news of the most popular...
wait. What's this?
most awarded stars in the history of the BTN...
...a man known to the entire nation as "The Voice of London..."
...passed away late last night from apparent heart failure.
she's lying. - How do you know?
she blinks a lot when she does a story she knows is false.
it came as no surprise to those who knew him that his body was at his office...
...where he often worked long hours after everyone else had gone home.
Lewis, you will be sorely missed.
V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.
you didn't take it, did you?
would you prefer a lie or the truth?
did you have anything to do with that?
Yes, I killed him. - You...
Oh, God. - You're upset.
I'm upset? You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.
I might have killed the Fingermen that attacked you. I heard no objection.
what? - Violence can be used for good.
what are you talking about? - Justice.
Oh, I see.
there's no court in this country for men like Prothero.
and are you going to kill more people?
Yes.
take a look at this.
Prothero's military record.
what do you see?
iraq, Kurdistan, Syria, before and after, Sudan.
busy boy. - But after all that...
...they put him in charge of a detention facility at Larkhill.
well, no good deed goes unpunished.
you think there's a connection between our boy and Larkhill?
it might explain the connection between him and the Hammond girl.
problem is, I can't find any other record of it.
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall that particular facility, inspector.
you're welcome to review our records. - We've been through your records.
all it says is that there was a detention facility at Larkhill...
...approximately 10 miles north of Salisbury.
well, there you have it.
this is a matter of some urgency, major.
we need to know if there was anything different about this facility.
I'm sorry, inspector, I simply cannot recall.
was there a specific profile for those being sent there?
usual undesirables, I should think. - But do you know?
of course not. I wasrt stationed there. - Do you know who was?
I cannot recall specific names, but if you look through our records...
your records are either deleted, omitted or missing.
as head of the Detention Program at that...
before you go any further, let me remind you things were very chaotic back then.
now we don't have the problems we had back then.
we all did what we had to do.
and in those circumstances, we did the best we could.
that's all I have to say about that.
you can do this.
Hi.
I've been thinking...
there's something I want to ask you...
...but I don't think you'll understand why unless you know a few things about me.
my father was a writer. You would have liked him.
he used to say artists used lies to tell the truth...
...while politicians used them to cover the truth up.
a man after my own heart.
he always told the best stories.
until my brother died.
that was when everything changed.
my brother was one of the students at St. Mary's.
after he died, my parents became political.
they protested the war and the Reclamation.
when Sutler was appointed high chancellor, they were at the riot in Leeds.
I watched on the television...
...thinking I was going to see my parents killed.
I remember them arguing at night.
mum wanted to leave the country. Dad refused.
he said if we ran away, they would win.
win, like...
...it was a game.
Evey, quick, hide!
mummy! - Evey!
I never saw them again.
it was like those black bags erased them from the face of the earth.
I'm sorry, Evey.
no, I'm the one that's sorry.
sorry I'm not a stronger person.
sorry I'm not like my parents. I wish I was...
...but I'm not.
I wish I wasrt afraid all the time...
...but I am.
I know this world is screwed up. Believe me, I know it better than most.
which is why I wanted to ask, if there is anything I can do to help make it right...
...please let me know.
if you wish.
do you really think you'll find something here?
worth a shot.
one thing is true of all governments:
the most reliable records are tax records.
it appears that the original electronic records have all been lost.
probably during the Reclamation. A lot of things went missing back then.
but I found this hard copy filed in the cold vault.
everything we've got on Larkhill is in there.
Thanks. This is a great help.
by the power of truth, I, while living, have conquered the universe.
personal motto? - From Faust.
that's about trying to cheat the devil, isn't it?
it is. And speaking of the devil...
...I was wondering if your offer to help was still standing.
of course. - It appears unforeseen circumstances...
...have accelerated my original plan.
as a result, I'm in need of someone with some theatrical skill.
I'll do my best.
I believe you will.
another doctor. Why does a detention facility need so many doctors?
I don't know, but this is interesting.
the highest-paid person at the camp was a priest.
Really? - Yeah, Father Lilliman.
Lilliman. - Was paid almost 200 grand a month.
now, that is interesting.
looks like he was promoted. He's a bishop now.
your Grace. - Oh, Denis.
has everything been arranged? - Yes.
I've just received your InterLink itinerary.
you should arrive in Perth in time for Mass.
you're most diligent, Denis...
...a noble example for all those who labor in the name of our Lord, but...
your Grace? - It wasrt labor I was speaking of.
it was, rather, my final remittance that I was interested in.
my last little joy.
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
she has arrived, but there was some confusion at the agency.
they've sent a new girl who, I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.
older?
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?
that is for Your Grace to decide.
Oh, my. - Your Grace.
to think that I doubted your loveliness for an instant.
mea culpa, my child.
mea culpa.
your Grace, we don't have much time and I have to tell you something.
a confession? I love the confessional game.
tell me your sins.
this isn't a game, Your Grace.
someone's coming. I think he means to kill you.
I'm sorry? - I'm telling you this...
...because I want some kind of protection or amnesty.
I had nothing to do with the Bailey and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.
I think this should balance it out. - What are you talking about?
I'm Evey Hammond. I'm...
I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V for the past several weeks.
I'm telling you that any moment, he's going to come through that door.
I unlocked the window in the room where Denis told me to get ready.
wonderful!
it's a game I've never played!
what a delightful mind you have. I hope the rest of you is just as interesting.
no, please, you have to believe me. - Oh, I do, I do, I do.
let me show you the firmness of my beliefs.
stop it! Get off of me!
seems I've captured a dangerous terrorist.
now, how best to procure her confession?
you little bitch. You fucking little whore!
Reverend. - Oh, my God.
she wasrt lying. It is you.
I'm sorry.
I had to. - Evey!
and thus I clothe my naked villainy with old odd ends stolen forth from holy writ...
...and seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
Oh, please, have mercy.
Oh, not tonight, Bishop.
not tonight.
don't do this, I beg of you.
well, then. Childrers hour at the abbey.
open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
what the...? - I don't want to die!
this is Surveillance 109. We have an emergency.
run every name in that file. I want the whereabouts of all of them.
tonight. - Yes, sir.
pucker up, here comes the Finger.
Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.
Creedy.
what are you doing here?
several prominent party members have been murdered, chief inspector.
this is no ordinary situation and requires more than your ordinary attention.
the chancellor demanded my immediate involvement.
it'll be hard to investigate if you're detaining all my witnesses.
the security of information is paramount.
in these volatile times...
...mistakes like Jordan Tower can no longer be tolerated...
...if, indeed, Jordan Tower was an accident.
what does that mean? - Terrorist seems to have...
...a rather intimate understanding of our system.
the chancellor suspects there might be an informer.
are you saying I'm under surveillance, Mr. Creedy?
at this time, it would behoove you...
...to cease any investigation of matters that have long since passed...
...and concentrate on the concerns of our present.
you mean Larkhill?
major Wilson is a friend of the high chancellor.
his loyalty is not in question. - But mine is?
your mother was Irish, wasrt she?
terrible what St. Mary's did to Ireland, wasrt it?
I've been a party member for 27 years.
if I were you, chief inspector...
...I'd find the terrorist...
...and I'd find him soon.
please.
Evey? Good God!
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go.
Yes, well, you better come inside before someone sees you.
Cheers. - I know every cop's looking for me.
I know it's horrible of me to put you in this situation.
Evey... - You could be in terrible trouble.
Evey, listen to me.
if the government ever searched my house, you would be the least of my problems.
you trusted me.
it would be terrible manners for me not to trust you.
Oh, my God. That's God Save the Queen.
my parents took me to it when they hung it at Gallery 12.
I thought Sutler had it destroyed. - He believes he did.
cost me more than this house, but no matter how bad I feel...
...it always cheers me up.
what is that? - It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.
are you a Muslim? - No, I'm in television.
but why would you keep it?
I don't have to be Muslim to find the images beautiful, poetry moving.
is it won'th it? If they found that here...
I told you, you'd be the least of my worries.
thank you, Gordon.
thank you so much. - It's all right.
this whole thing started the night he blew up the Old Bailey.
I was on my way here, and...
Yes.
you see, we are both fugitives in our own way.
but... - You're wondering why...
...you were invited here to supper in the first place if my appetites were for less conventional fare....
unfortunately, a man in my position is expected to entertain...
...young and attractive ladies like yourself.
because in this world, if I were to invite who I desired...
...I would undoubtedly find myself without a home, let alone a television show.
I'm sorry. - Not as sorry as I am.
the truth is, after so many years...
...you begin to lose more than just your appetite.
you wear a mask for so long, you forget who you were beneath it.
I'm sorry, chief inspector. Same basic toxicology as Prothero.
you could get these poisons from any house in London.
Thanks, Delia.
any leads on finding this guy?
nothing yet. But there's something else you can help me with.
you started as a botanist, didn't you?
it's... It's a Scarlet Carson.
they're believed to be extinct.
he leaves them at the crime scenes.
I'd appreciate it if you could have a look at it.
any information could be helpful.
of course.
excuse me.
yeah?
I just finished going through the file, inspector. You better get back here.
Yeah, okay.
my God. He's killed them all. - All but one.
who is she? - Not sure.
she's clearly one of the people in charge at Larkhill.
but after they shut it down, she disappeared for two years.
till she applied for an overseas visa, which was denied.
running away?
probably, because after that, all record of her seems to stop.
she changed her name. - That's what I'm guessing.
I put a call in to the registry, but I haven't heard back.
it's late, or early. - Call them again. I want that name.
what? Are you sure about that?
okay. Thank you.
Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name to Delia Surridge.
the coroner? - Yeah.
Jesus, I just saw her.
it's you, isn't it?
you've come to kill me. - Yes.
thank God.
I'm sorry, I can't get a response from that number.
there's a problem with the connection.
Jesus Christ.
he's there.
after what happened, after what they did...
...I thought about killing myself.
but I knew that one day you'd come for me.
I didn't know what they were going to do.
I swear to you.
read my journal.
what they did was only possible because of you.
Oppeneimer was able to change more than the course of a war.
he changed the entire course of human history.
is it wrong to hold on to that kind of hope?
I have not come for what you hoped to do.
I've come for what you did.
it's funny.
I was given one of your roses today.
I wasrt sure you were the terrorist until I saw it.
what a strange coincidence, that I should be given one today.
there are no coincidences, Delia.
only the illusion of coincidence.
I have another rose.
and this one is for you.
you're going to kill me now? - I killed you 10 minutes ago while you slept.
is there any pain? - No.
thank you.
is it meaningless to apologize?
never.
I'm so sorry.
damn it.
the terrorist obviously wanted us to have it.
he wanted us to know the story, or at least a part of it.
am I to understand that you have read this document, inspector?
Yes, sir. - Has anyone else read it?
no, sir. - Then let me make this perfectly clear to you.
the contents of this document are a matter of national security...
...constituting an assault on the character of several important party members...
...as well as a blatant violation of the Articles of Allegiance.
as the authenticity of this document cannot be verified...
...it could be an elaborate forgery created by the terrorist...
...as easily as it could be the deranged fantasy of a former party member...who resigned for psychological reasons.
any discussion of this document or its contents...
...will be regarded, at the very least, as an act of sedition...
...if not a willful act of treason.
is that understood, Mr. Finch? - Yes, sir.
you would do well, inspector...
...to put it out of your mind.
may 23rd.
my first batch of subjects arrived today...
...and I have to admit that I'm very excited.
this could be the dawn of a new age.
nuclear power is meaningless...
...in a world where a virus can kill an entire population...
...and leave its wealth intact.
stay together! - Come on, move!
may 27th.
commander Prothero toured the lab with a priest, Father Lilliman...
...who I was told is here to monitor for Rules and Rights violations.
it made me nervous, but the commander assured me there wouldn't be a problem.
june 2nd.
I keep wondering if these people knew how they might be helping their country...
...if they would act any differently.
they're so weak and pathetic. They never look you in the eye.
I find myself hating them.
august the 18th.
of the original four dozen, over 75 percent are now deceased.
no controllable pattern has yet emerged.
september the 18th.
there is one case that continues to give me hope.
he exhibits none of the immune-system pathologies the other subjects developed.
I've discovered cellular anomalies in his blood that I've been unable to categorize.
the mutations seem to have triggered...
...the abnormal development of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.
the subject said he could no longer remember...
...who he was or where he was from.
whoever he was, he is now the key to our dream...
...and the hope that all of this will not have been in vain.
november the 5th.
it started last night, around midnight.
the first explosions tore open the entire medical section.
all my work, gone.
I was trying to understand how it could've happened when I saw him.
the man from room 5.
he looked at me.
not with eyes. There were no eyes.
but I know he was looking at me because I felt it.
Oh, God...
...what have I done?
what is that you're making?
we called it "eggie in the basket." My mum made them.
this is weird. - What?
the first morning I was with him, he made me eggs just like this.
Really? - I swear.
that is a strange coincidence. Although there's an obvious explanation.
there is? - Yes, Evey.
I am V.
at last you know the truth.
you're stunned, I know.
hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath this wrinkled, well-fed exterior...
...there lies a dangerous killing machine with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.
that is not funny, Gordon.
Yeah, I know. I'm useless without a studio audience.
I've seen people go to jail for less than that.
of course, he was right, wasrt he?
there is something wrong with this country.
morning, inspector.
you're at it early.
is something wrong? You don't look so good, sir.
I wanna ask a question, Dominic.
I don't care if you answer me or not.
I just wanna say this aloud.
but I need to know that this question will not leave this office.
Yeah, of course, inspector, but...
because of the terrorist?
no.
so, what is it, chief? What's going on?
the question I want to ask is about St. Mary's...
...and Three Waters.
the question that's kept me up for the last 24 hours...
...the question I have to ask, is:
what if the worst...
...the most horrifying biological attack in this country's history...
...was not the work of religious extremists?
well, I don't understand. We know it was. They were caught. They confessed.
and they were executed. I know.
and maybe that's really what happened.
but I see this chain of events...
...these coincidences, and I have to ask:
what if that isn't what happened? What if someone else unleashed that virus?
what if someone else killed all those people?
would you really wanna know who it was?
sure.
even if it was someone working for this government?
that's my question.
if our own government was responsible...
...for what happened at St. Mary's and Three Waters...
...if our own government was responsible for the deaths of almost 100, 000 people...
...would you really wanna know?
this has to be the bloody coldest March in years.
keep talking like that, we'll lose our party status.
they're a pack of lying, greedy hypocrites! - Keep it down, will you?
based on random audio sweeps, I've projected that right now...
...80 percent of the public believe the terrorist is still alive.
we're also showing a 12-percent increase...
...over last month's positive mention in all four quadrants.
Mr. Creedy? - We're handling it as best we can.
arrests are as high as they've been since the Reclamation.
I want more than arrests. I want results.
what's all this about? - I'm celebrating.
celebrating what?
I think this could be the best show we've ever done.
very good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
listen, we've got an extraordinary show for you tonight.
you're not gonna believe it. As a matter of fact, I don't think I do.
will you please give a very warm welcome...
...to our own Chancellor Adam Sutler!
no way! - No, it can't be!
we threw out the censor-approved script and shot one I wrote this morning.
Oh, my God.
chancellor, chancellor, chancellor...
...I understand you've been under tremendous strain lately since the beginning of this whole terrorism business...
...and we thought it would be a nice idea to try and help you relax. Girls?
warm milk. There's nothing better.
I understand you enjoy a glass every night, chancellor.
since I was a boy.
but you're wrong, Mr. Deitrich.
the terrorist was never a serious concern. - Oh, really?
chancellor, chancellor... - It's him.
are you saying that he's not still alive and active?
the terrorist has been neutralized.
Oh, my God! Chancellor, look!
the terrorist!
the terrorist!
get him!
Oh, dear.
at last!
and now, for all the world to see.
it's him!
Unand me! I am your chancellor!
how dare you! I am the chancellor!
imposter!
soldiers! That man is the terrorist!
I order you to shoot that traitor! - Liar!
faker! - Fraud!
ready! - Aim!
fire! - Fire!
what are they gonna do, fine us?
big deal. We've got the most-watched show on air.
well, you're my agent, that's what I pay you for.
protect me.
I should've hired him to be my mother.
you're mad. - Either that or I wasrt breast-fed.
is everything a joke to you? - Only the things that matter.
what if they come after you? - I tell you what's gonna happen.
I'll have to make some kind of apology, do some boring fundraiser.
in the meantime, our ratings will go through the roof. It'll be fine. Trust me.
Gordon?
quick, Evey, hide!
not so funny now, is it, funnyman?
gotcha. - No, no.
do you know why you're here, Evey Hammond?
please.
you've been charged with three counts of murder...
...the bombing of government property, conspiracy to commit terrorism...
...treason and sedition, the penalty for which is death by firing squad.
you have one chance, and only one chance, to save your life.
you must tell us the identity or whereabouts of code name V.
if your information leads to his capture...
...you will be released from this facility immediately.
do you understand what I'm telling you?
you can return to your life, Miss Hammond.
all you have to do is cooperate.
process her.
I know there's no way I can convince you this is not one of their tricks...
...but I don't care.
I am me.
my name is Valerie.
I don't think I'll live much longer, and I wanted to tell someone about my life.
this is the only autobiography that I will ever write and, God...
...I'm writing it on toilet paper.
I was born in Nottingham in 1985.
I don't remember much of those early years, but I do remember the rain.
my grandmother owned a farm in Tottle Brook...
...and she used to tell me that God was in the rain.
I passed my 11 Plus and went to Girls' Grammar.
it was at school that I met my first girlfriend.
her name was Sarah.
it was her wrists.
they were beautiful.
I thought we would love each other forever.
I remember our teacher telling us...
...that it was an adolescent phase that people outgrew.
Sarah did.
I didn't.
in 2002, I fell in love with a girl named Christina.
that year I came out to my parents.
I couldn't have done it without Chris holding my hand.
my father wouldn't look at me. He told me to go and never come back.
my mother said nothing.
but I'd only told them the truth. Was that so selfish?
our integrity sells for so little, but it is all we really have.
it is the very last inch of us.
but within that inch...
...we are free.
it ends whenever you want it to.
just tell us where he is. - I don't know.
I'd always known what I wanted to do with my life...
...and in 2015 I starred in my first film, The Salt Flats.
it was the most important role of my life. Not because of my career...
...but because that was how I met Ruth.
the first time we kissed...
...I knew I never wanted to kiss any other lips but hers again.
we moved to a small flat in London together.
she grew Scarlet Carsons for me in our window box...
...and our place always smelt of roses.
those were the best years of my life.
but America's war grew worse and worse, and eventually came to London.
the bill proposed by the Undersecretary for Defense, Adam Sutler...
...to close the remaining tube stations passed with...
after that, there were no roses anymore.
not for anyone.
you won't last much longer.
you're gonna die here.
why protect someone who doesn't give a shit about you?
I remember how the meaning of words began to change.
how unfamiliar words like "collateral" and "rendition" became frightening...
...while things like "Norsefire" and the "Articles of Allegiance" became powerful.
I remember how "different" became dangerous.
I still don't understand it...
...why they hate us so much.
they took Ruth while she was out buying food.
I've never cried so hard in my life.
it wasrt long till they came for me.
it seems strange that my life should end in such a terrible place.
but for three years, I had roses and apologized to no one.
I shall die here.
every inch of me shall perish.
every inch...
...but one.
an inch.
it is small, and it is fragile...
...and it is the only thing in the world won'th having.
we must never lose it or give it away. We must never let them take it from us.
I hope that, whoever you are, you escape this place.
I hope that the world turns and that things get better.
but what I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean...
...when I tell you that even though I do not know you...
...and even though I may never meet you...
...laugh with you, cry with you...
...or kiss you...
...I love you.
with all my heart...
...I love you.
Valerie.
I'm instructed to inform you that you have been convicted by special tribunal...
...and that unless you are ready to offer your cooperation, you are to be executed.
do you understand what I'm telling you?
Yes. - Are you ready to cooperate?
no. - Very well.
escort Miss Hammond back to her cell.
arrange a detail of six men...
...and take her out behind the chemical shed and shoot her.
it's time.
I'm ready.
look, all they want is one little piece of information.
just give them something, anything.
thank you...
...but I'd rather die behind the chemical sheds.
then you have no fear anymore. You're completely free.
what?
Hello, Evey.
you.
it was you? - Yeah.
that wasrt real?
is Gordon...? - I'm sorry, but Mr. Deitrich's dead.
I thought they'd arrest him...
...but when they found a Koran in his house, they had him executed.
Oh, God.
fortunately, I got to you before they did. - You got to me?
you did this to me?
you cut my hair?
you tortured me?
you tortured me.
Why?
you said you wanted to live without fear. I wish there'd been an easier way...
...but there wasrt. - Oh, my God.
I know you may never forgive me...
...but nor will you understand how hard it was for me.
every day, I saw in myself everything you see in me now.
every day, I wanted to end it.
but each time you refused to give in, I knew I couldn't.
you're sick! You're evil!
you could have ended it. You could have given in, but you didn't.
Why? - Leave me alone! I hate you!
that's it! See, at first, I thought it was hate too.
hate was all I knew. It built my world, imprisoned me...
...taught me how to eat, how to drink, how to breathe.
I thought I'd die with all the hate in my veins.
but then something happened.
it happened to me just as it happened to you.
shut up! I don't want to hear your lies!
your own father said that artists use lies to tell the truth.
Yes, I created a lie.
but because you believed it, you found something true about yourself.
no. - What was true in that cell is true now.
what you felt in there has nothing to do with me.
I can't feel anything anymore!
don't run from it, Evey. You've been running all your life.
I can't... Can't breathe.
asthma. When I was little...
listen to me, Evey.
this may be the most important moment of your life. Commit to it.
they took your parents from you. They took your brother from you.
they put you in a cell and took everything they could take except your life.
and you believed that was all there was, didn't you?
the only thing you had left was your life, but it wasrt.
Oh, please. - You found something else.
in that cell, you found something that mattered more to you than life.
when they threatened to kill you unless you gave what they wanted...
...you told them you'd rather die.
you faced your death, Evey.
you were calm. You were still.
try to feel now what you felt then.
Oh, God.
I felt...
yes?
I'm dizzy.
I need air.
please, I need to be outside.
there's a lift. It'll take us to the roof.
God is in the rain.
I'm leaving.
there are 872 songs in here.
I've listened to them all, but I've never danced to any of them.
did you hear me? - Yes.
I can't stay here.
I know.
well, you won't find any more locked doors here.
I thought about keeping this...
...but it didn't seem right, knowing you wrote it.
I didn't.
may I show you something before you go?
she was real. - Yes.
she's beautiful.
did you know her? - No.
she wrote the letter just before she died.
and I delivered it to you as it had been delivered to me.
then it really happened, didn't it?
Yes. - You were in the cell next to her.
and that's what this is all about.
you're getting back at them for what they did to her.
and to you. - What was done to me created me.
it's a basic principle of the universe...
...that every action will create an equal and opposing reaction.
is that how you see it?
like an equation? - What was done to me was monstrous.
and they created a monster.
do you know where you'll go? - No.
that would have scared me before...
...but I suppose I should thank you.
thank you.
goodbye.
Evey...
...may I ask you for something?
if I had one wish, I would wish to see you again, if only once before the 5th.
all right. - Thank you.
chancellor, I know no one seems to want to discuss this...
...but if we're to be prepared for any eventuality...
...then it can't be ignored any longer.
the red report in front of you has been vetted by several demolition specialists.
now, it concludes that...
...the most logical delivery system for the terrorist to use...
...would be an airborne attack.
a separate report has been filed...
...suggesting a train, despite the fact that the tunnels surrounding Parliament...
...have been sealed shut.
who filed that report?
chief Inspector Finch.
do you have any evidence to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch?
no, sir. Just a feeling.
if I am sure of anything, inspector...
...it is that this government will not survive if it is to be subject to your feelings.
Mr. Dascomb, what we need right now...
...is a clear message to the people of this country.
this message must be read in every newspaper...
...heard on every radio, seen on every television.
this message must resound throughout the entire InterLink!
I want this country to realize that we stand on the edge of oblivion.
I want every man, woman and child to understand how close we are to chaos.
I want everyone...
...to remember why they need us!
in the former United States, civil war continues to devastate the Midwest.
scientists attribute this water shortage to the lack of rainfall the last two years.
ministry officials expect water coupon prices to rise.
police have arrested nine suspects...
can you believe this shit? Been going on all summer.
outside the quarantine zone, a new airborne pathogen has killed 27 people.
authorities uncovered new evidence linking the terrorist organization called V...
...to the St. Mary's viral attack on London 14 years ago.
my friend inside the Finger came up with something.
there were three men.
covert intel.
original black-baggers, all under Creedy.
alan Percy, Robert Keyes, William Rookwood.
the day after the St. Mary's outbreak...
...Percy gives his Beretta a blowjob, Keyes dies in a fire...
Rookwood goes missing.
bloody coincidences are making me sick to my stomach.
Rookwood.
how do I know that name?
shit. He must have had a hidden trip on his file at the Finger.
but how'd he know it was you?
what do we do?
I'm a cop. I have to know.
I came when they opened it. It gave me the collywobbles.
still does.
that's close enough, inspector.
we're not wired.
I'm sorry, but a man in my position survives by taking every precaution.
you have information for us? - No, you already have the information.
all the names and dates are inside your head.
what you want, what you really need, is a story.
a story can be true or false.
I leave such judgments to you, inspector.
our story begins, as these stories often do...
...with a young, up-and-coming politician.
he's a deeply religious man and a member of the Conservative Party.
he's completely single-minded and has no regard for the political process.
the more power he attains, the more obvious his zealotry...
...and the more aggressive his supporters become.
eventually, his party launches a special project in the name of national security.
at first it's believed to be a search for biological weapons...
...and it's pursued without regard to its cost.
however, the true goal of this project is power.
complete and total hegemonic domination.
the project, however, ends violently.
but the efforts of those involved are not in vain...
...for a new ability to wage war is born from the blood of one of the victims.
imagine a virus, the most terrifying virus you can...
...and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure.
but if your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon?
well, it's at this point in our story that along comes a spider.
a man seemingly without a conscience...
...for whom the ends always justify the means.
he suggests that their target should not be an enemy of the country...
...but rather, the country itself.
three targets are chosen to maximize the effect of the attack:
a school, a tube station and a water-treatment plant.
several hundred die within the first few weeks.
three Waters has, in fact, been contaminated.
authorities are attempting to control its deadly spread.
sent destruction through the Underground.
fueled by the media, fear and panic spread quickly...
...fracturing and dividing the country until, at last, the true goal comes into view.
before the St. Mary's crises...
...no one would have predicted the results of the election that year. No one.
and then not long after the election, lo and behold, a miracle.
some believed it was the work of God himself.
but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members...
...that made them all obscenely rich.
a year later, several extremists are tried, found guilty and executed...
...while a memorial is built to canonize their victims.
but the end result, the true genius of the plan, was the fear.
fear became the ultimate tool of this government.
through it, our politician was ultimately appointed...
...to the newly created position of high chancellor.
the rest, as they say, is history.
can you prove any of this? - Why do you think I'm still alive?
all right. We'd like to take you into protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.
I'm sure you would.
but if you want that recording, you'll do what I tell you to do.
put Creedy under 24-hour surveillance.
when I feel safe he can't pick his nose without you knowing...
...I'll contact you again.
till then, cheerio.
Rookwood...
...why didn't you come forward before?
what were you waiting for?
well, for you, inspector.
I needed you.
what's he doing in the dark there?
creepy Creedy. Not sure I wanna know.
Sutler can no longer trust you, can he, Mr. Creedy?
and we both know why.
after I destroy Parliament...
...his only chance will be to offer them someone else, some other piece of meat.
and who will that be?
you, Mr. Creedy.
a man as smart as you has probably considered this.
a man as smart as you probably has a plan.
that plan is the reason Sutler no longer trusts you.
it's the reason why you're being watched right now...
...why there are eyes and ears in every room of this house...
...and a tap on every phone. - Bollocks.
Oh, a man as smart as you, I think, knows otherwise.
what do you want? - Sutler.
come, now, Mr. Creedy, you knew this was coming.
you knew that one day it'd be you or him.
that's why Sutler's been kept underground for security purposes.
that's why there are several of your men close to Sutler...
...men that can be counted on. All you have to do is say the word.
what do I get out of this deal? - Me.
if you accept, put an X on your front door.
why should I trust you?
because it's the only way you're ever going to stop me.
it is not my sword, Mondego, but your past that disarmed you.
may we come up?
you find your own tree.
we got Creepy pinned like a butterfly for weeks.
still no word. What's he waiting for?
yeah? Inspector, it's for you.
Yeah. - Is that Chief Inspector Finch?
it is. - This is Captain Clark of the 137th Ward at Southend.
we found him. - Found who?
william Rookwood, the one you're looking for.
I saw your report a couple weeks back, thought I'd run it through our John Does.
I hooked him. Perfect dental match.
a floater. Fishermen picked him up. No ID, never solved. Till now, that is.
william Rookwood is dead? - I'd say so. Twenty years now.
goddamn it!
that son of a bitch sat there...
...and spoon-fed me that bullshit, and I ate it up!
so, what do we do now, inspector?
we do what we should have been doing.
we find him.
every day, gentlemen.
every day that brings us closer to November...
...every day that man remains free...
...is one more failure.
three hundred and forty-seven days, gentlemen.
three hundred and forty-seven failures!
chancellor, we do not have the adequate force...
we are being buried beneath the avalanche of your inadequacies, Mr. Creedy!
I'll get it.
Eric Finch? - Yeah.
bloody hell.
how many went out?
so far we count eight boxcars.
several hundred thousand, at least. - Christ.
I want anyone caught with one of those masks arrested!
give me the money! Give me the fucking money!
we're under siege here. The whole city's gone mad.
this is exactly what he wants. - What?
anarchy in the UK! - Chaos.
Mr. Creedy, I am holding you personally responsible for this situation.
the problem is that he knows us better than we know ourselves.
that's why I went to Larkhill last night.
that's outside quarantine. - I had to see it.
there wasrt much left.
but when I was there, it was strange.
I suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected.
like I could see the whole thing.
one long chain of events that stretched all the way back before Larkhill.
I felt like I could see everything that had happened...
...and everything that was going to happen.
Hey, you!
it was like a perfect pattern laid out in front of me...
...and I realized that we were all a part of it...
...and all trapped by it.
so do you know what's gonna happen?
no. It was a feeling.
but I can guess.
with so much chaos, someone will do something stupid.
and when they do...
...things will turn nasty.
rioters were arrested in Brixton.
and then Sutler will be forced to do the only thing he knows how to do.
at which point, all V needs to do is keep his word.
and then...
tonight's your big night.
you ready for it?
are we ready for it?
I missed this song.
I didn't think you'd come.
I said I would.
you look well.
thank you.
may I inquire as to how you've avoided detection?
a fake ID works better than a Guy Fawkes mask.
I must confess, every time I heard a siren, I worried about you.
I worried about myself for a while.
but then, one day, I was at a market...
...and a friend, someone I had worked with at the BTN, got in line behind me.
I was so nervous that when the cashier asked me for my money, I dropped it.
my friend picked it up...
...and handed it to me.
she looked at me right in the eyes...
...didn't recognize me.
whatever you did to me worked better than I'd have imagined.
I have a gift for you, Evey...
...but before I give it to you, I'd like to ask you something.
would you dance with me?
now? On the eve of your revolution?
a revolution without dancing is a revolution not won'th having.
I'd love to.
tonight, I will speak directly to these people...
...and make the situation perfectly clear to them.
the security of this nation depends on complete and total compliance.
tonight, any protestor, any instigator or agitator...
...will be made example of!
chancellor, there is a contingency that has not been addressed.
and what is that, Mr. Dascomb?
should the terrorist succeed... - He won't.
I understand that it is highly unlikely, but if he does...
if he does, and something happens to that building...
...the only thing that will change, the only difference it will make...
...is that tomorrow morning, instead of a newspaper I will be reading Mr. Creedy's resignation!...
you've been busy. They're very scared right now.
I heard Sutler's going to make a public statement tonight.
it's nearly time.
the masks were ingenious.
it was strange to suddenly see your face everywhere.
conceal me what I am, and be my aid for such disguise as haply shall become the form of my intent.
twelfth Night. - Viola.
I don't understand. - What?
how you can be one of the most important things that has happened to me...
...and yet I know almost nothing about you.
I don't know where you were born, who your parents were...
...if you had any brothers or sisters.
I don't even know what you really look like.
Evey, please.
there is a face beneath this mask...
...but it's not me.
I'm no more that face than I am the muscles beneath it...
...or the bones beneath them.
I understand.
thank you.
there isn't much time.
I have something I must give you.
I went by Parliament.
never seen anything like it. Tanks, anti-aircraft, infantry.
makes you wish that no one would show up tonight.
but if they do, what do you think will happen?
what usually happens when people without guns stand up to people with guns.
pull over here.
we've searched these tunnels for weeks. You think you're gonna find him now?
inspector.
it's all gone wrong, hasn't it?
the Underground? I thought they closed this all down.
they did.
it took nearly 10 years to clear the tracks and lay a bit of my own.
let me show you.
these tracks lead to Parliament.
Yes.
then it's really going to happen, isn't it?
it will if you want it to.
what? - This is my gift to you, Evey.
everything that I have: My home, my books, the gallery, this train...
...I'm leaving to you to do with what you will.
is this another trick, V?
no. No more tricks. No more lies.
only truth.
and the truth is, you made me understand that I was wrong...
...that the choice to pull this lever is not mine to make.
Why? - Because this world...
...the world that I'm a part of and that I helped shape, will end tonight.
and tomorrow, a different world will begin...
...that different people will shape, and this choice belongs to them.
where are you going?
the time has come for me to meet my maker...
...and to repay him in kind for all that he's done.
V, wait! Please, you don't have to do this.
you could let it go. We could leave here together.
no. You were right about what I am.
I have no tree waiting for me.
all I want, all I deserve, is at the end of that tunnel.
that's not true.
I can't.
my fellow Englishmen...
...tonight, our country...
...that which we stand for...
...and all that we hold dear...
...faces a grave and terrible threat.
the area's clean, sir.
this violent and unparalleled assault to our security...
...will not go undefended.
where is he?
or unpunished.
penny for the Guy.
our enemy is an insidious one, seeking to divide us...
...and destroy the very foundation of our great nation.
I have kept my side of the bargain, but have you kept yours?
bring him down.
tonight we must remain steadfast.
we must remain determined.
but most of all, we must remain united.
those caught tonight in violation of curfew...
...will be considered in league with our enemy...
...and prosecuted as a terrorist without leniency or exception.
I want to see his face.
tonight I give you my most solemn vow...
...that justice will be swift...
...it will be righteous...
...and it will be without mercy.
Oh, God. No.
at last, we finally meet.
I have something for you, chancellor.
a farewell gift.
for all the things you've done, for the things you might have done...
...and for the only thing you have left.
goodbye, chancellor.
Mr. Creedy.
disgusting.
now that's done with...
...It's time to have a look at your face.
take off your mask.
no.
defiant to the end, huh?
you won't cry like him, will you? You're not afraid of death.
you're like me.
the only thing you and I have in common, Mr. Creedy, is we're both about to die.
how do you imagine that's gonna happen?
with my hands around your neck.
bollocks.
what are you gonna do, huh?
we've swept this place. You've got nothing.
nothing but your bloody knives and your fancy karate gimmicks.
we have guns.
no, you have bullets and the hope that when your guns are empty...
...I'm no longer standing, because if I am...
...you'll all be dead before you've reloaded.
that's impossible!
kill him.
my turn.
die! Die!
why won't you die?!
why won't you die?
beneath this mask there is more than flesh.
beneath this mask there is an idea, Mr. Creedy.
and ideas are bulletproof.
this is perimeter one. Whitehall is secure. Over.
this is General Ackroyd.
keep communication tight.
I won't have this getting any more bollixed up than it already is.
Oh, God, we have to stop your bleeding.
please, don't. I'm finished and glad of it.
don't say that.
I told you, only truth.
for 20 years I sought only this day.
nothing else existed...
...until I saw you.
then everything changed.
I fell in love with you, Evey...
...like I no longer believed I could.
V, I don't want you to die.
that's the most beautiful thing...
...you could have ever given me.
eyes and ears have detected movement heading to Trafalgar Square.
this is perimeter one. We have enemy contact.
hold it. Stop right there.
you're Evey Hammond, aren't you?
then it's over?
almost.
stop. Get your hand off that lever.
no.
enemy is approaching fast. Requesting orders.
what shall we do? - No response from Command.
or from Party Leader Creedy.
or from the high chancellor.
why are you doing this?
because he was right. - About what?
that this country needs more than a building right now. It needs hope.
bloody hell, stand down! Stand down!
Jesus bloody Christ.
it's time.
tell me...
...do you like music, Mr. Finch?
that music?
Yes.
his music.
who was he?
he was Edmond Dantes.
and he was my father...
...and my mother.
my brother.
my friend.
he was you...
...and me.
he was all of us.
no one will ever forget that night...
...and what it meant for this country.
but I will never forget the man...
...and what he meant to me.
he should have died in here.
what the fuck have you done?
it's a goddamn mess, I'll tell you that.
what's all this? - You tell me. They're addressed to you.
take it.
dear Mr. Dufresne:
in response to your inquiries...
...the state has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project.
this is $ 200.
in addition, the library district has generously responded...
...with a donation of used books and sundries.
we trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed.
please stop sending us letters.
clear all this out before the warden gets back.
Yes, sir.
good for you, Andy.
Wow!
it only took six years.
from now on, I'll write two letters a week instead of one.
I believe you're crazy enough. Get this stuff out...
...like he said. I've got to pinch a loaf.
when I come back...
...this is all gone, all right?
do you hear that?
Dufresne!
Andy, let me out!
Andy
I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.
truth is, I don't want to know.
some things are best left unsaid.
I like to think it was something so beautiful...
... it can't be expressed in words...
... and makes your heart ache because of it.
I tell you, those voices soared...
... higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.
it was like a beautiful bird flapped into our drab cage...
... and made those walls dissolve away.
and for the briefest of moments...
... Every last man at Shawshank felt free.
it pissed the warden off something awful.
open the door.
open it up!
Dufresne, open this door!
turn that off!
I am warning you. Turn that off!
Dufresne
you're mine now.
Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.
on your feet.
Hey, look who's here. - Maestro!
you couldn't play something good, huh? Like Hank Williams?
they broke the door down before I could take requests.
was it worth two weeks? - Easiest time I ever did.
no such thing as easy time in the hole. - A week in the hole is like a year.
damn straight. - I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.
so they let you tote that record player down there, huh?
it was in here.
in here.
that's the beauty of music. They...
...can't get that from you.
haven't you ever felt that way about music?
well, I played a mean harmonica as a younger man.
lost interest in it, though.
didn't make much sense in here.
here's where it makes the most sense.
you need it so you don't forget.
forget?
forget that there are...
...places...
...in the world that aren't made out of stone.
there's something...
...inside...
...that they can't get to...
...that they can't touch.
that's yours.
what are you talking about?
hope.
hope.
let me tell you something, my friend.
hope is a dangerous thing.
hope can drive a man insane.
it's got no use on the inside.
you'd better get used to that idea.
like Brooks did?
sit down.
says here that you've served 30 years of a life sentence.
you feel you've been rehabilitated?
Oh, yes, sir.
without a doubt.
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.
no danger to society here.
God's honest truth.
absolutely rehabilitated.
thirty years.
Jesus, when you say it like that...
you wonder where it went.
I wonder where 10 years went.
here.
a little parole rejection present.
go ahead and open it.
went through one of your competitors.
I hope you don't mind. I wanted it to be a surprise.
it's very pretty.
thank you.
you going to play it?
no.
not right now.
roll in!
lights out!
Andy was as good as his word.
he wrote two letters a week instead of one.
in 1959, the state senate finally clued in to the fact...
... they couldn't buy him off with just a $ 200 check.
appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of $500...
... just to shut him up.
and you'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it.
he made deals with book clubs, charity groups.
he bought remaindered books by the pound...
treasure Island.
robert Louis...
Stevenson.
fiction, adventure.
what's next?
I got here Auto Repair...
...and Soap Carving.
trade skills and hobbies. Under "Educational," behind you.
count of Monte Crisco.
that's "Cristo," you dumb shit.
by Alexandree...
...Dum-ass.
dumb ass.
dumb ass?
Dumas. I Know what that's about?
you'd like it. It's about a prison break.
we ought to file that under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?
the rest of us did our best to pitch in when and where we could.
by the year Kennedy was shot...
... Andy had transformed a storage room smelling of turpentine...
... into the best prison library in New England...
... complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.
that was also when Warden Norton...
... instituted his famous "Inside Out" program.
you may remember reading about it.
it made the papers and got his picture in Look magazine.
it's no free ride...
but rather a genuine progressive advance in corrections and rehabilitation..
our inmates, properly supervised...
...will be put to work outside these walls...
...performing all manner of public service.
these men can learn the value of an honest day's labor and provide a service to the community.....
...at a bare minimum of expense to Mr. And Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.
of course he didn't tell the press...
... that "bare minimum of expense" is a fairly loose term.
there are 100 different ways to skim off the top.
men, materials, you name it.
and oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in!
at this rate, you'll put me out of business.
with this pool of slave labor, you can underbid any contractor in town.
we're providing a valuable community service.
that's fine for the papers, but I've got a family to feed.
we go back a long way.
I need this highway contract. I don't get it and I go under. That's a fact.
you have some of this fine pie my missus made for you. You think about that。
I wouldn't worry too much about this contract.
I already got my boys committed elsewhere.
you be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.
and behind every shady deal...
... behind every dollar earned...
... there was Andy, keeping the books.
two deposits.
Maine National and New England First. Night drops as always, sir.
get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
if they over-starch my shirts again, they'll hear from me.
how do I look?
very nice. - Big charity to-do up Portland way. - Governor will be there.
you want the rest of this?
woman can't bake worth shit.
thank you, sir.
he's got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.
he's got scams you haven't even dreamed of. I Kickbacks on his kickbacks.
a river of dirty money running through here.
sooner or later, he'll have to explain where it came from.
that's where I come in.
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.
stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.
I send it out into the real world, and when it comes back...
clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh? - Cleaner.
by the time Norton retires, I'll have made him a millionaire.
if they ever catch on, he'll wind up in here wearing a number himself.
I thought you had more faith in me than that.
I know you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail.
now anybody gets curious, FBI, IRS...
...whatever.
it'll lead to somebody.
sure it is, but not to me, and certainly not to the warden.
all right, who?
Randall Stevens.
who?
the "silent" silent partner.
he's the guilty one, the man with the bank accounts.
it's where the filtering process starts.
they trace anything, it'll just lead to him.
but who is he?
he's a phantom, an apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.
I conjured him...
...out of thin air.
he doesn't exist, except on paper.
you can't just make a person up.
sure you can, if you know how the system works.
it's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...
...driver's license, Social Security.
you're shitting me.
if they trace any accounts, they'll wind up chasing...
...a figment of my imagination.
well, I'll be damned!
did I say you were good?
shit, you are Rembrandt.
the funny thing is...
...on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow.
I had to come to prison to be a crook.
ever bother you?
I don't run the scams. I just process the profits.
a fine line, maybe...
...but I also built that library...
...and used it to help guys get their high school diploma.
why do you think he lets me do all that?
keep you happy and doing the laundry money instead of sheets.
well, I work cheap. That's the tradeoff.
Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965...
... on a two-year stretch for B and E.
that's breaking and entering to you.
cops caught him sneaking TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney.
young punk.
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...
... cocky as hell.
come on, old boys. Moving like molasses!
making me look bad.
we liked him immediately.
I'm backing out the door and I got the TV like this.
a big old thing. I couldn't see shit. Then I hear this voice.
freeze, kid, hands in the air.
I was standing there, holding onto that TV. Finally the voice says:
you hear what I said, boy?" I say, " Yes, sir. I did.
but if I drop this, you get me on destruction of property too.
you done some stretch in Cashman, right?
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time, let me tell you.
weekend furloughs. Work programs.
not like here.
sounds like you done time all over.
I've been in and out since I was 13.
name it, chances are I've been there.
perhaps you should try a new profession.
what I mean is...
...you're not a very good thief. You should try something else.
Yeah, what the hell you know about it, Capone?
what are you in for?
me?
a lawyer fucked me.
everybody's innocent in here. Don't you know that?
as it turned out, Tommy had himself a young wife and a new baby girl.
maybe he thought of them on the streets...
... or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.
whatever it was...
... something lit a fire under that boy's ass.
thought I might try for my high school equivalency.
hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.
I ain't no goddamn loser.
you mean that? - Yeah.
you really mean that?
Yes, sir, I do.
good. Because if we do this...
...we do it all the way, a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.
thing is, see...
...I don't read so good.
well.
you don't read...
...so well.
we'll get to that.
so Andy took Tommy under his wing.
started walking him through his ABC's.
Tommy took to it pretty well too.
boy found brains he never knew he had.
before long, Andy started him on his course requirements.
he really liked the kid.
gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shit heap.
but that wasn't the only reason.
prison time is slow time.
so you do what you can to keep going.
some fellas collect stamps.
others build matchstick houses.
Andy built a library.
now he needed a new project.
Tommy was it.
it was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks.
the same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.
in prison...
... a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.
by 1966, right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams...
... it was lovely Raquel.
time.
well?
well, it's for shit.
I wasted a whole year of my time with this bullshit.
it's probably not that bad.
I didn't get a thing right. It might as well have been in Chinese.
let's see how the score comes out.
I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out.
two points, right there!
there's your goddamn score!
goddamn cats crawling up trees, 5 times 5 is 25...
fuck this place!
fuck it!
I feel bad.
I let him down.
that's crap, kid.
he's proud of you.
we're old friends, I know him as good as anybody.
smart fellow, ain't he?
smart as they come. He was a banker on the outside.
what's he in here for anyway?
murder.
the hell, you say.
you wouldn't think it to look at the guy.
caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased them both.
what?
about four years ago...
...I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.
I stole a car.
it was a dumb-fuck thing to do.
about six months left to go...
...I get a new cellmate in.
Elmo Blatch.
big, twitchy fucker.
kind of roomie you pray you don't get. You know what I'm saying?
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.
said he pulled hundreds of jobs.
hard to believe, high-strung as he was. You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.
talked all the time too. That's the other thing. He never shut up.
places he'd been in...
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.
even people he killed.
people who "gave him shit.
that's how he put it.
so one night, like a joke...
...I say to him, "Elmo, who did you kill?
so he says:
I got me this job one time, busing tables at a country club...
...so I could case all these big rich pricks that come in.
so I pick out this guy...
...go in one night...
...and do his place.
he wakes up...
...and gives me shit.
so I killed him.
him and this tasty bitch he was with.
and that's the best part.
she's fucking this prick, see...
...this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy.
some hotshot banker.
and he's the one they pinned it on.
I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.
what amazes me most is you'd be taken in by it.
sir?
it's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you.
he hears your tale of woe and naturally wants to cheer you up.
he's young, not terribly bright.
it's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.
sir, he's telling the truth.
let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist.
you think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, " Yes, I did it. I confess.
by the way, add a life term to my sentence.
with Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.
that's assuming Blatch is still there.
chances are, he'd be released by now.
they'd have his last known address. It's a chance, isn't it?
how can you be so obtuse?
what?
what did you call me?
obtuse. Is it deliberate?
you're forgetting yourself.
the country club will have his old timecards.
records, W-2s with his name on them.
if you want to indulge this fantasy, it's your business.
don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
if I got out, I'd never mention what happens here.
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering that money.
don't ever mention money to me, you son of a bitch!
not in this office...
...not anywhere. Get in here, now!
I just wanted to put you at ease, that's all.
solitary. A month.
what's wrong with you? Get him out of here.
this is my chance to get out! It's my life! Understand?!
get him out!
a month in the hole.
that's the longest stretch I ever heard of.
it's all my fault.
bullshit.
you didn't pull the trigger or convict him.
are you saying Andy is innocent?
I mean, for real innocent?
it looks that way.
sweet Jesus.
how long has he been here now?
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.
Williams, Thomas. - Yeah, over here.
what you got?
board of Education.
that son of a bitch mailed it.
you going to open it or stand there with your thumb up your butt?
thumb up my butt sounds better.
Skeets, come on. Give me that, you shithead.
Floyd, come on.
red
will you throw that away, please?
well, shit.
the kid passed. C + average.
thought you'd like to know.
warden wants to talk.
out here?
that's what the man said.
warden?
Tommy
I'm asking you to keep this conversation just between us.
I feel awkward enough as it is.
we got a situation here.
I think you can appreciate that.
Yes, sir.
I sure can.
I tell you, son, this thing really came along and knocked my wind out.
it's got me up nights. That's the truth.
the right thing to do...
...sometimes it's hard to know what that is.
do you understand?
I need your help, son.
if I'm going to move on this...
...there can't be the least little shred of doubt.
I have to know...
...if what you told Dufresne was the truth.
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury...
...with your hand on the Good Book...
...and take an oath before Almighty God himself?
just give me that chance.
that's what I thought.
I'm sure by now you've heard.
terrible thing.
a man that young...
...less than a year to go, trying to escape.
broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.
truly, it did.
we just have to put it behind us.
move on.
I'm done.
everything stops.
get someone else to run your scams.
nothing stops.
nothing.
or you will do the hardest time there is.
no more protection from the guards.
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton and cast you down with the sodomites.
you'll think you've been fucked by a train.
and the library?
gone.
sealed off, brick by brick.
we'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.
they'll see the flames for miles.
we'll dance around it like wild Injuns.
you understand me? Catching my drift?
or am I being obtuse?
give him another month to think about it.
my wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.
like a closed book.
complained about it all the time.
she was beautiful.
God, I loved her.
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.
I killed her, Red.
I didn't pull the trigger...
...but I drove her away.
that's why she died, because of me...
...the way I am.
that don't make you a murderer.
bad husband, maybe.
feel bad about it if you want, but you didn't pull the trigger.
no, I didn't.
somebody else did.
and I wound up in here.
bad luck, I guess.
it floats around.
it's got to land on somebody.
it was my turn, that's all.
I was in the path of the tornado.
I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.
think you'll ever get out of here?
me?
Yeah.
one day, when I got a long, white beard...
...and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs.
I tell you where I'd go.
Zihuatanejo.
say what?
Zihuatanejo.
it's in Mexico.
a little place on the Pacific Ocean.
you know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?
they say it has no memory.
that's where I want to live the rest of my life.
a warm place with no memory.
open up a little hotel right on the beach.
buy some worthless old boat...
...and fix it up new.
take my guests out...
...charter fishing.
Zihuatanejo.
in a place like that, I could use a man that knows how to get things.
I don't think I could make it on the outside.
I been in here most of my life.
I'm an institutional man now.
just like Brooks was.
you underestimate yourself.
I don't think so.
in here I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure, but...
...outside all you need is the Yellow Pages.
hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.
pacific Ocean?
shit.
scare me to death, something that big.
not me.
I didn't shoot my wife, and I didn't shoot her lover.
whatever mistakes I made, I've paid for them and then some.
that hotel, that boat...
I don't think that's too much to ask.
you shouldn't be doing this to yourself.
this is just shitty pipe dreams.
mexico is way down there and you're in here...
...and that's the way it is.
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.
it's down there and I'm in here.
I guess it comes down to a simple choice.
get busy living...
...or get busy dying.
Andy
red
if you ever get out of here, do me a favor.
sure, Andy. Anything.
there's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?
a lot of hayfields up there. - One in particular.
it's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end.
it's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.
it's where I asked my wife to marry me.
we went there for a picnic...
...and made love under that oak...
...and I asked and she said yes.
promise me, Red.
if you ever get out...
...find that spot.
at the base of that wall, there's a rock that has no earthly business in Maine.
piece of black, volcanic glass.
something's buried under it I want you to have.
what, Andy?
what's buried under there?
you'll have to pry it up...
...to see.
no, I'm telling you. The guy is...
he's talking funny.
I'm really worried about him.
let's keep an eye on him.
that's fine during the day, but at night he's all alone.
Oh, Lord.
what?
Andy come down to the loading dock today.
he asked me for a length of rope.
rope? Six feet long.
and you gave it to him.
sure. Why wouldn't I?
Jesus! Heywood. How was I supposed to know?
remember Brooks Hatlen?
Andy would never do that.
never.
I don't know.
every man has his breaking point.
Lickety-split. Want to get home.
just about finished, sir.
three deposits tonight.
get my stuff down to the laundry.
and shine my shoes.
I want them looking like mirrors. - Yes, sir.
it's good having you back.
place wasn't the same without you.
lights out!
I've had some long nights in stir.
alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts...
... time can draw out like a blade.
that was the longest night of my life.
give me a count!
tier 3 south, clear!
tier 3 north, clear!
man missing on tier 2, cell 245!
Dufresne!
come out. You're holding up the show!
don't make me come down or I'll thump your skull for you!
damn it, you're putting me behind! I got a schedule to keep.
you'd better be sick or dead in there. I shit you not!
you hear me?
Oh, my Holy God.
I want every man on this cellblock questioned.
start with that friend of his. - Who?
he
open 237.
what do you mean, "He just wasn't here"? Don't say that to me.
don't tell me that again.
but sir, he wasn't.
I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?
is that what you're saying?
am I blind, Haig? - No, sir!
what about you. You blind?
tell me what this is. - Last night's count.
you see Dufresne's name there? I sure do. Right there.
Dufresne.
he was in his cell at lights out.
reasonable he'd be here in the morning.
I want him found.
not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!
Yes, sir.
let's go. Move your butts.
stand.
well?
well, what?
I see you two all the time. You're thick as thieves, you are.
he must have said something.
no, sir, Warden.
not a word.
Lord, it's a miracle!
man vanished like a fart in the wind.
nothing left...
...but some damn rocks on a windowsill.
and that cupcake on the wall. Let's ask her.
maybe she knows.
what say there, fuzzy-britches? Feel like talking?
guess not.
why should she be any different?
this is a conspiracy.
that's what this is.
one big, damn conspiracy!
and everyone's in on it!
including her!
in 1966...
... Andy Dufresne escaped...
... from Shawshank Prison.
all they found was a muddy set of prison clothes...
... a bar of soap...
... and an old rock hammer...
... damn near worn down to the nub.
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.
old Andy did it in less than 20.
Oh, Andy loved geology.
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.
an ice age here million years of mountain building there.
geology is the study of pressure and time.
that's all it takes, really.
pressure...
... and time.
that and a big goddamn poster.
like I said...
... in prison, a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.
seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard...
... a handful at a time.
I guess after Tommy was killed...
... Andy decided he'd been here long enough.
Lickety-split. I want to get home.
I'm just about finished, sir.
three deposits tonight.
Andy did like he was told.
buffed those shoes to a high mirror-shine.
the guards simply didn't notice.
neither did I.
I mean, seriously...
... how often do you really look at a man's shoes?
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards...
... of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.
or maybe I just don't want to.
five hundred yards.
that's the length of five football fields.
just shy of half a mile.
the next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her secret...
... a man nobody ever laid eyes on before...
... strolled into the Maine National Bank.
until that moment, he didn't exist.
except on paper. - May I help you?
he had all the proper ID...
... driver's license, birth certificate, Social Security card...
and the signature was a spot-on match.
I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business.
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.
thank you.
I'm sure I will.
here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else?
please.
would you add this to your outgoing mail?
I'd be happy to.
good day, sir.
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.
all told, he blew town...
... with better than $370, 000 of Warden Norton's money.
severance pay for 19 years.
good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.
Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.
if you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.
I wasn't there to see, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...
... when they took him away.
norton had no intention of going that quietly.
samuel Norton.
we have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.
open the door.
I'm not sure which key.
make it easy on yourself, Norton!
I like to think the last thing that went through his head...
... other than that bullet...
... was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.
not long after the warden deprived us of his company...
... I got a postcard in the mail.
it was blank, but the postmark said...
... Fort Hancock, Texas.
fort Hancock...
... right on the border.
that's where Andy crossed.
when I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down...
... it always makes me laugh.
Andy Dufresne...
... who crawled through a river of shit...
... and came out clean on the other side.
Andy Dufresne...
... headed for the Pacific.
Hadley's got him by the throat, right?
he says, " I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident.
those of us who knew him best talk about him often.
I swear, the stuff he pulled...
my friends could use a couple of beers.
and he got it!
sometimes it makes me sad, though Andy being gone.
I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.
their feathers are just too bright.
and when they fly away...
... the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.
but still ......
... the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.
I guess I just miss my friend.
please sit down.
Ellis Boyd Redding...
...your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.
you feel you've been rehabilitated?
rehabilitated?
well, now, let me see.
I don't have any idea what that means.
it means you're ready to rejoin society...
I know what you think it means, sonny.
to me it's just a made-up word.
a politician's word so that...
...Young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie...
...and have a job.
what do you really want to know?
am I sorry for what I did?
well, are you?
there's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.
not because I'm in here or because you think I should.
I look back on the way I was then...
...a young...
...Stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.
I want to talk to him.
I want to try and talk some sense to him.
tell him the way things are.
but I can't.
that kid's long gone...
...and this old man is all that's left.
I got to live with that.
rehabilitated?
it's just a bullshit word.
so you go on and stamp your forms, sonny, and stop wasting my time.
because to tell you the truth...
...I don't give a shit.
here you go, miss.
restroom break?
you don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go.
yes sir
forty years I've been asking permission to piss.
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.
there's a harsh truth to face.
no way I'm going to make it on the outside.
all I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole...
... So maybe they'd send me back.
terrible thing, to live in fear.
Brooks Hatlen knew it.
knew it all too well.
all I want is to be back where things make sense.
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.
only one thing stops me.
a promise I made to Andy.
there it is.
much obliged, sir.
dear Red:
if you're reading this, you've gotten out...
... And if you've come this far, maybe you'd come a bit further.
you remember the name of the town, don't you?
Zihuatanejo.
I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels.
I'll keep an eye out for you, and the chessboard ready.
remember, Red...
... Hope is a good thing...
... maybe the best of things.
and no good thing ever dies.
I will be hoping that this letter finds you...
... And finds you well.
your friend...
... Andy.
get busy living...
... Or get busy dying.
that's goddamn right.
for the second time in my life...
... I'm guilty of committing a crime.
parole violation.
of course I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that.
not for an old crook like me.
fort Hancock, Texas, please.
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.
I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel.
a free man at the start of a long journey...
... whose conclusion is uncertain.
I hope I can make it across the border.
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.
I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.
I hope.
...I don't read so good.
well.
you don't read so well.
we'll get to that.
so Andy took Tommy under his wing.
started walking him through his ABC's.
Tommy took to it pretty well too.
boy found brains he never knew he had.
before long, Andy started him on his course requirements.
he really liked the kid.
gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shit heap.
but that wasn't the only reason.
prison time is slow time.
so you do what you can to keep going.
some fellas collect stamps.
others build matchstick houses.
Andy built a library.
now he needed a new project.
Tommy was it.
it was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks.
the same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.
in prison a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.
by 1966, right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams...
... it was lovely Raquel.
time.
well?
well, it's for shit.
I wasted a whole year of my time with this bullshit.
it's probably not that bad.
I didn't get a thing right. It might as well have been in Chinese.
let's see how the score comes out.
I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out.
two points, right there!
there's your goddamn score!
goddamn cats crawling up trees, 5 times 5 is 25...
fuck this place!
fuck it!
I feel bad.
I let him down.
that's crap, kid.
he's proud of you.
we're old friends, I know him as good as anybody.
smart fellow, ain't he?
smart as they come. He was a banker on the outside.
what's he in here for anyway?
murder.
the hell, you say.
you wouldn't think it to look at the guy.
