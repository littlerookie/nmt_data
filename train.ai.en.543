nokia, for example, spent years trying to break into japan's big but idiosyncratic mobile-handset market with its rest-of-the-world-beating products before finally conceding defeat.
nokia, he said, would pull back from many areas to focus its resources on a relatively small number of big markets, including the u.s., china, and certain other european and asian markets.
